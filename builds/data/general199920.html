I am playing on a high magic based world where I would need at least a low 50 AB and 70 AC (without IMP EXPERTISE)<br><br>I am thinking of a Fighter/WM/Shadowdancer or Rogue build. Epic dodge is a plus.<br><br>If you know of a build or are able to build, please let me know... I cannot find a search option, so I am forced to ask here.<br><br>Thanks in advance

I'd be sorely tempted by some sort of Ftr/rogue/DwD to fit that sort of requirement, either that or Ftr/rogue/WM.

Dragon Shape shifter dude usually hits around 50AB and with decent armor it can hook it's AC into the high 70s and low 80s <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-DaMouse

thats right w/o the gear and while dual weilding...the dual weilding was not a requirement so the ab is well into the acceptable range i should not have added the gear into the equation but he mentioned the high magic persistant world and I made a misteak to post it with the items...add +4 to all stats because he did not want a dual weilder.<br>_________________<br>gwen'eth moonthistle

One reason is that shadow dancer to lvl 10 gives you the prerequisites you need for epic dodge as bonus feats, that way you can use your feats on other useful things <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

shadowdancer was my choice because of their ability to get higher hit points, hide in plain sight is HUGE,  get defensive roll and improved evasion by the time they hit 10th and shadow evade was something i never mentioned but you have it's use 3 times a day and it adds ac/concealment and dmg reduction for five rounds(it really helps in a large boss battle...i'm glad you did not mind the items being assumed to be there because I assumed you were on such a server and i was just adding on what i figured you'd find...btw the way i have another fighter/wm/shadowdancer single weild build with selfconceal 50% and epic dodge and around the same offensive/defensive stats or even possibly better...i'd have to go on the server i use to write down the build and then post it...if you are interested...let me know...<br>_________________<br>gwen'eth moonthistle
