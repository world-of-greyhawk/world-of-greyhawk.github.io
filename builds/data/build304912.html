Hello everyone, <br><br>I created and tested this build as a level 40 build with no magic items in the character training module with a +20 monster powerup, and it did OK. My guess is that it's not totally unplayable PvM, but I haven't tested that yet. If you do decide to play it, watch out for the alignment shift at level 20. Other than that it's a great build. I'd like to thank Thax, The Supreme Force, FinneousPJ (although he only joined in the end), onion eater and even avado (yes, I forgive you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  )* for the advice that helped me improve it. This build was originally inspired in Sir Smokesalot by Midthrates, which is now illegal in the last patch. Here's the final version! <br><br>* I apologize if I forgot to mention anyone. Thanks to you as well! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br><br>THE FORSAKEN HOLY DRAGON <br><br>Paladin (20) / Druid (18) / Monk (2)<br><br>RACE: Human<br><br>ALIGNMENT: Lawful Good -&gt; Lawful Neutral (at level 20)<br><br>STARTING STATS:<br><br>STR - 14 (+2)<br>DEX - 8 (-1)<br>CON - 10 (0)<br>WIS - 16 (+3)<br>INT - 14 (+2)<br>CHA - 14 (+2)<br><br>ENDING STATS:<br><br>STR - 14 (+4)<br>DEX - 8 (-1)<br>CON - 10 (0)<br>WIS - 30 (10)<br>INT - 14 (+2)<br>CHA - 16 (+3)<br><br>BASIC STATS:<br><br>Hit Points: 360<br><br>Skillpoints: 255<br><br>Saving Throws: (Fort/Ref/Will): 25/18/29 (+8 vs Spells, Evasion)<br><br>AC: (naked): 27<br><br>BAB: 30<br><br>AB (naked/unbuffed): 32<br><br>Buffed AB: 51 (with a mundane scimitar)<br><br>Spellcasting: Paladin (20), Druid (18).<br><br>LEVELING GUIDE: <br><br>1- Paladin - Power Attack, Knockdown<br>2- Paladin<br>3- Paladin - Divine Shield<br>4- Paladin - WIS +1 (17)<br>5- Paladin<br>6- Paladin - Divine Might<br>7- Paladin<br>8- Paladin - WIS +1 (18)<br>9- Paladin - Extend Spell<br>10- Paladin<br>11- Paladin<br>12- Paladin - Improved Knockdown, WIS +1 (19)<br>13- Paladin<br>14- Paladin<br>15- Paladin - Empower Spell<br>16- Paladin - WIS +1 (20)<br>17- Paladin<br>18- Paladin - Improved Critical (Unarmed Strike)<br>19- Paladin<br>20- Paladin - WIS +1 (21)<br>21- Druid - Great Wisdom I (22)<br>22- Druid<br>23- Druid<br>24- Druid - Great Wisdom II (23), WIS +1 (24)<br>25- Druid<br>26- Druid<br>27- Druid - Great Wisdom III (25)<br>28- Druid - WIS +1 (26)<br>29- Druid<br>30- Druid - Great Wisdom IV (27)<br>31- Druid - <br>32- Druid - WIS +1 (28)<br>33- Druid - Great Wisdom V (29)<br>34- Druid - <br>35- Druid<br>36- Druid - Great Wisdom VI (30), CHA +1 (15)<br>37- Druid<br>38- Monk<br>39- Druid - Dragon Shape<br>40- Monk - CHA +1 (16)<br><br><br>SKILLS: Concentration (43), Discipline (43), Tumble (40), Spellcraft (40), Persuade (20), Listen (43), Heal (26)<br><br>ADVANCED STATS AND NOTES:<br><br>STATS IN DRAGON FORM (Fully Buffed):<br><br>STR - (60)<br>DEX - (44)<br>CON - (38)<br>WIS - (39)<br>INT - (14)<br>CHA - (27)<br><br>AB: 67 (53 unbuffed)<br><br>ATTACKS: 67/64/61/58/55/52 (+1 at 67 if hasted, +8 VS Evil once)<br><br>HP: 1028/920<br><br>SPELL RESISTANCE: 30<br><br>Saves (Fort/Ref/will): 45/40/40<br><br>AC: 72<br><br>STRENGTHS:<br><br>MAX AB Dragon<br>Great buffs<br>Good combat feats<br>MONK CHEESE!<br><br>WEAKNESSES:<br><br>No spell penetration<br>Easily dispellable<br>Average in human form (not weak because Paladin buffs are great <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   )<br>Requires an alignment shift<br><br>Well, I hope you like it, <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif">  <br><br>Take it EZ!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 04/29/09 18:07</span></i></p>

hey maxi.  <br><br>for the record, it is playable from 1 to 40. THere are very few builds that arent. Unplaybable builds are ones where the stats are min/maxed for certain things, and feats are taken later than normal in order to maximize ab or what have you.  We mostly refer to unplayables as born at 40 builds, where they take 1 bard lvl for skill dump at lv 37, which usually means that the build goes through the entire life without +8 to dodge ac..  again, the whole concept of unplayable, is, in my opinion, reserved for some RARE builds.  Just so you can gain an idea, check this one out from a friend of mine   <a href="http://www.forgotten-worlds.net/old-forum/viewtopic.php?t=2349&amp;highlight=" target="_blank">Dwarven Wall of Wonders, by Stryder Blade </a> if you notice my posting there!  Even though he gets weapon finesse at 21 (which MANY Could consider unplayable to lv 21) because of the classes he mixed and such, it was infact, EXTREMELY tough.  Yes i learned alot from stryder that isnt in the books anywhere. **please, if you have a question about the link PM me!  dont put it in maxi's thread.  <br><br>with respect to this build, 20 paladin lvls with TONS of wisdom is very playable!  The one thing i wonder, if you are tryin to squeeze epic prowess, couldnt fighter be a viable alternative (you get all the ab and tons of feats).  Just a thought.

Thanks for the change of tone, that was all I was asking for in the first place. <br><br>Now to your question. The reason for not taking Fighter over Paladin is simple: you lose too much and you don't gain enough. It was just this one and only feat that would improve this build. Everything else won't work while shifted. With Paladin in the equation, you can free up some slots for Ice Storms in the Druid side of the cake, since you can take Empowered Bull's Strength as a Paladin spell. Plus a Pally with Empower Spell, Extend Spell, 7 Level 1 spells, 7 Level 2 spells, 6 Level 3 spells and 6 level 4 spells is kinda scary! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">    . Dropping 2 CON seems like much less of a sacrifice to me than losing Paladin buffs here.<br><br>EDIT: And you gotta agree that if I was willing to go as far as changing alignments for Paladin to fit in this build, certainly the lack of Epic Prowess wouldn't be reason enough to give up on it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>Take it EZ!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Maximillian Kane on 01/22/09 21:29</span></i></p>
