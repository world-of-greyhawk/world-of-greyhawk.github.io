OK, this is my try to make a nice Rogue/Cleric/Assassin.<br>It’s the first build I post, although I have already made several for myself. Sorry if some of the feats or skills are wrongly translated (I have the Spanish version of the game)<br><br>The Drow Slayer of Lolth<br><br>Race: Elf (if Drows can be chosen as a subrace in your server, choose it!! It will give you a Spell Resistance of 11 + lvl!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  )<br>Sex: Female (this is optional but I can’t imagine a male version of this character)<br><br>Characteristics:<br><br>STR	10	10<br>DEX	18	30<br>CON	10	10<br>WIS	15	18<br>INT	14	14<br>CHA 	 8	 8<br><br>Alignment: Lawful neutral<br>Classes: Cleric 12 / Rogue 10 / Assassin 18<br>Cleric Domains: Strength and Treachery<br><br>Level Progression:<br><br>  1 – Rogue 1	Dodge<br>  2 – Rogue 2<br>  3 – Cleric 1	Weapon Finesse<br>  4 – Cleric 2<br>  5 – Rogue 3<br>  6 – Cleric 3	Extend Spell<br>  7 – Rogue 4<br>  8 – Cleric 4<br>  9 – Cleric 5	Mobility<br>10 – Rogue 5<br>11 – Rogue 6<br>12 – Cleric 6	Improved Critical: Short Sword<br>13 – Cleric 7<br>14 – Rogue 7<br>15 – Rogue 8	Disarm<br>16 – Cleric 8<br>17 – Cleric 9<br>18 – Rogue 9	Improved disarm<br>19 – Rogue 10	Defensive Roll<br>20 – Cleric 10<br><br>Epic Levels:<br><br>21 – Assassin 1	Great Dexterity I<br>22 – Cleric 11<br>23 – Cleric 12<br>24 – Assassin 2	Great Dexterity II<br>25 – Assassin 3<br>26 – Assassin 4<br>27 – Assassin 5	Great Dexterity III<br>28 – Assassin 6<br>29 – Assassin 7<br>30 – Assassin 8	Epic Dodge<br>31 – Assassin 9<br>32 – Assassin 10<br>33 – Assassin 11 Great Dexterity IV<br>34 – Assassin 12<br>35 – Assassin 13<br>36 – Assassin 14 Great Dexterity V, Self-Concealment I* (Assassin extra epic feat)<br>37 – Assassin 15<br>38 – Assassin 16<br>39 – Assassin 17 Self-Concealment II*<br>40 – Assassin 18 Self-Concealment III* (Assassin extra epic feat)<br><br>Boost Dex at lvls 4, 12, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36<br>Boost Wis at lvls 8, 16, 40<br><br>Skills: Concentration 26, Spellcraft 26, Hide 43, Move Silently 43, Tumble 43, UMD 22<br>You can distribute the rest of the points among Open Locks, Set and Disable Traps, PickPocket, Appraise…<br><br>Naked AC: 28<br>Hit points: 264 (a bit low; if you feel it’s too low you can take Toughness instead of one of the pre-epic feats, but you can take it to 344 by casting Endurance)<br>BAB: 29 (it can be easily improved with divine power, divine favor and Cat’s Grace to a max of 38, I think)<br>15-18d6 Sneak Attacks (see below)<br>Death Attack DC: 30 (you can reach to 32 with buffs)<br>Good Will and Reflex Saves, but poor Fortitude<br><br>(These are all approximate numbers, I’m doing this without checking it out on the game)<br><br>*I don’t know if the Self-concealment feats stack with the concealment granted by Improved Invisibility. It would be great for this build(80% concealment!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif"> )but I’m afraid they don’t <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  . In this case, I would take 3 Improved Sneak Attack feats.<br><br>Lolth has sent you to slay those opposing to her implacable will. Drawing upon her sacrilegious might, you cast Resistance, Cat’s Grace, Endurance, Divine Power, Divine Might, and make your short sword an even more fatal weapon by casting Darkfire and Grater Magical Weapon on it. Then you use your dominion of the Strength powers to raise your force and use your ability as an Assassin, or your domain over Treachery (or you read a scroll, don’t forget you have UMD and Spellcraft), to cast Improved Invisibility on yourself. When you spot your enemy, he can’t see you. You attack him, and you leave him half-dead and paralyzed. Even if is not the case, he hardly hits you (high AC and 50% at least of concealment). In one of your attacks, you take his weapon out of his hands, leaving him unarmed. If you like, you can make yourself invisible again and finish his miserable life off. His soul is brought to Lolth’s realm to suffer your beloved goddess’ wraith.<br><br>Any comments or improvements will be welcome. I don't know if something like this has already been posted, sorry. Of course I’m sure this build has lots of disadvantages, and maybe mistakes, buy, hey, that’s your work, not mine! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">

Why take wisdom to 18 when you take cleric to 12??   IMHO this is a waste (i know it gives +4 blah blah).  YOu should take cleric to 15 min/max!  NO less, no more.  This gives you +5 in all the good cleric thingys!<br><br>Peace

I would go to C15 if possible.  Though C12 works well, 15 levels make you fully buffable.  25 levels isn't bad in terms of blending Rogue and Assassion together either for mix of epics, sneak attacks and so on.<br><br>If you do go 12 levels in Cleric, I would also try to manage my levels in R and A to odd.  I believe it would net you similar amounts of bonus feats and you get 1d6 extra sneak attack.<br><br>R13A15 = 15d6 + 3 bonus feats (2 Rogue, though not epic, 1 Assassin Epic)<br><br>R10A18 = 14d6 + 3 bonus feats (1 Rogue, 2 Assassin epic)<br><br>Depending on your feats, it may be better to go the first as Rogue bonus feats are all very good and can include Improved SA.  This will impact how much SC you can get however. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif"> <br><br>Trickery and Travel tend to be good domains for this type of build as well.

I play divine rogues a lot so I will make some comments:<br>1) Forget assassin as a class except for roleplay reasons.  The main advantages to assassin are death attack and improved invisibility.  Your death attack will suck because your int is low and you number of levels is low.  You get imp invis as a cleric with the trickery domain which is a no-brainer due to the skill boosts alone.  So there is no point.<br>2) You are a dex elf, the imp crit should be rapier.<br>3) The conseal feats do not stack and thus are wasted<br>4) knockdown will give you sneak attacks, disarm will not<br>5) disarm with a smal weapon (short sword) gives you a penalty agains most of the weapons you will face.<br><br>There are two main paths to take.  <br><br>1)lots of cleric like C31,R5,Fighter4 or C23/R13/F4 (fighter=4 attacks/round, weapon specialization, and extra feats)<br>Advantages: lots of spells, high spell dc, epic spells, same skills as a normal rogue, plus Divine trickery gives your temporary boosts to your rogue skills of god level (higher then any normal rogue could dream of)<br>Disadvantages: low sneak damage, misses some nice rogue bonus feats, epic dodge is late or impossible to get.<br><br>2) Lots of rogue like C15,R21,F4 or C9,R27,F4<br>Advantages: Lots of sneak damage, good buffing spells, lots of rogue bonus feats, easy path to epic dodge<br>Disadvantages: few spells with short durations and low DCs, no epic spells<br><br>One more important issue is cleric domains.  Most people automatically pick strength and war.  While these are decent, not using trickery for skill boosts and improved invis is just crazy. Some other domains to considder in addition to trickery are the following(best have *):<br><br>*Animal: Your summons (ie disposable meat shields to allow you sneaks) are 1 level higher than normal and you get the cats grace buff along with true seeing.  You also get to polymorph.  Ever been a low strength thief and had to crawl home because you were so encumbered?  Grab all the loot then polymorph to an umberhulk.<br><br>Knowledge: id your own stuff.  use knock and put skills in something other than open lock. great detection with clair/trueseeing<br><br>*Magic: 1 pt of ac with Mage armor even if you have good ac, stoneskin for damage reduction, and some offensive spell power.<br><br>*Plant: This is a personal favorite. (make sure you have enough cleric levels and WIS for level 7 spells) Ok, the AC from barkskin is nice, but think of this fun situation:  You hit a fighter type with hold person, word of faith, etc. then cast creeping doom and let them die from insect bites.  Or cast darkness then creeping doom.  Fighter charges in because he has blindfight, but then starts taking damage from insects.  Keep in mind the damage scales to 1000 pts of damage!<br><br>*Travel:Web and entangle for extra sneaks.  Freedom and haste are both useful depending on where you are playing.<br><br>Also, if you doubt how effective the caster version can be, try this on a test module:  Buff yourself, then cast creeping doom and storm of vengance at your feet.  All you need is good AC and threats just die all around you.
