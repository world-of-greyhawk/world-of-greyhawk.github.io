I like dexers.  The high AC you get from the dex makes your build survivable, secondly, since you only have to focus on 1 stat, you're AB tends to be higher than strength based builds.  Unfortunately, dexers have a reputation that they are unable to dish out the damage, this builds attempts to address this problem.<br><br>Race: Human<br>Starting Stats:<br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 16<br>CON: 14<br>INT: 14<br>WIS: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Ability Bonuses: Everything goes to DEX<br><br>lvls 1-21: Ranger<br>Feats: Exotic Weapons(1),Weapon Finess(1),Weapon Focus Kama(3),Expertise(6),Imp.

Enemy(Bonus Ranger35)x2<br><br><br>Skills:  I recommend maxing out spot, discipline, and of course tumble.  This build gets lots of skills though, so you have a lot of options for what to do with the rest of them.  I put them into craft and set trap because they seemed kinda rangery, and also hide and move silently.<br><br><br>What makes this build cool:  So as a ranger you're going to want to dual wield, which I don't necessarily like because then you can't use a shield, and so then your AC will suck.  Thats why you take the monk lvl, so that you can get you wis to AC.  The naked AC on this guy is:<br><br>10+2 wis+9 dex+8 tumble+2 armor skin=31 which isn't too bad.  On my server they only allow up  to +7 armor mods on items, and with that and haste I can get it up to 76, 86 if I imp. expertise.<br><br>The other neat thing about this guy is the number of attacks and damage that each attack does.  As a monk dual wielding kamas, I get 10 attacks per round hasted (6 main hand, 2 off hand, 1 haste, 1 flurry of blows).  If I'm fighting a favored enemy, and I have 13 of them, my damage per blow is (13 fav. enemy + 2d6 bane + 6 fighter + 1d6 kama).  This is serious damage, especially if you get some strength bonuses and a nice magical kama.  Multiply that by 10 attacks per round, and it gets nasty.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/10/07 14:32</span></i></p>

About favored enemy damage...<br><br>I think favored enemy damage is ranger levels divided by 5, not just the number of favored enemies you have. The manual is kind of hazy on this, but I do not think the epic favored enemies gained from ranger bonus feats add to the damage, so the build's damage would be 7+2d6+6+1d6. Not a big deal though. Minimum of 16 damage; maximum of 31. 10 attacks with that is still heavy damage.<br><br>My only concern is this builds lack of uncanny dodge, so if he is caught flat-footed he looses all his dex AC.

Firstly, I don't use a shield, I dual wield, that was the point of taking the monk lvl, to make up for the AC loss.<br><br>Secondly, favored enemy damage in NWN is the number of favored enemies that you have.  I have played this build quite a bit and am sure of it.<br><br>Yes, no uncanny dodge sucks, it's what keeps this build from being a tank.  However, if you stay alert and keep the guy attacking, he does ok.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By m_beaubien on 03/28/05 22:05</span></i></p>

Yes, but if I used a shield I would lose the extra monk attacks wouldn't I?  Even if that's not the case, I would still lose 2 attacks from the offhand.  So it's at least 2, potentially 5 attacks that I would lose by using a shield.  <br><br>Also, assuming I can get +12 to wis from items, I would be looking at +8 wis AC compared to +10 AC that I would get from a Tower Shield assuming that it was +7.  Of course if where you play allows higher than +7 mods the difference becomes more extreme... but that's the rules where I play.

Wasnt figuring on wis bonus items , very good point. Makes the difference between shield and wis minimal. However you take your monk level at level 37. Still leaves 36 levels where a shield could come in handy.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

might just be missing it; but what is the:<br>Base bab with unenchanted kama; against non-favoured, dualwielding?

A question; and this is just to try determine a way of keeping that dex ac.  Bear in mind I know little about building characters short of what I've seen listed on these forums.<br>Would this build benefit by losing the epic specialisation and getting 4 assassin levels instead of the fighter?  <br>Benefits (as I see it):<br>1) You have UMD (epic umd focus too I think if you plan it right) which gives you flameweapon scroll usage [off a scroll it casts lvl17 for 1d4 + 10 damage]; only needs 27/28 umd to cast successfully EVERY time.  In my experience, the most useful kit _always_ ends up being a class you don't have.  And that's just plain awful; specially when you are needing the item badly (ac bonus/feat/etc).<br>2) You get 2d6 death attack when the enemy is not focussed on you.  Since you're not really a tank (as the poster noted; though with the assassin levels you could be), this should be little difference.<br>3) You get ghostly visage as a feat - which gives you 10% concealment, +1/5 dr and immunity to lvl1 and lower spells (blegh on the last two).<br>4) You can use poison on your weapon.<br>5) You get a +2 save to poison attacks<br>6) You get Uncanny dodge I<br><br>Drawbacks:<br>1) No epic weapon specialisation. See 1) 2) and 4) that, imo, is MUCH better for most cases.<br>2) 2 less feats [or three, not sure on calc].  This would easily be countered by the epic weapon specialisation; and perhaps epic focus - freeing you up to use any weapon you care to on your offhand with no pause to think.<br><br>FYI; someone asked on another post if flameweapon/darkfire stacks with innate fire damage on a weapon; I have tried it on a weapon with +Fire 10 damage and it stacked for me.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 03/29/05 13:12</span></i></p>

Syrath, you're right, this can be a tough build for the first 36 levels, a shield might not be a bad idea in certain areas.  In fact, on the PW I play, I did 32 ranger / 4 Ftr / 4 Mnk.  That way I could take the monk at lvl 22 and also, not have a xp pen.  However, I lost 2 favored enemies <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> .  I prefer the 35/4/1 build as just a straight lvl 40 build, that's why i posted it.<br><br>So, base attack, i'm assuming with no dex items, and without a magical kama would be:<br><br>30 base + 9 dex + 1 weap. foc + 2 epic wf + 1 epic prow. = 43.  Against a favored enemy this would increase by 2.  Dual weilding kamas decrease it by 2.  Oh, and rangers can cast aid, so increase it by 1 for that.  Using items to boost your dex would increase it by 6.<br><br>I like you're assasin idea.  The uncanny dodge and umd would be very helpful.  Plus you wouldn't have an xp pen.  I guess the reason to go with my build over that would be if you're looking for maximum damage per hit.  You'll lose 6 damage per hit, which adds up to 60 per round.  I don't think you can count on your death attack to make up for that.  Also you would lose 1 feat, which would mean I couldn't take either armor skin or epic proweress, which would be sad.<br><br>I like it though, an assassin with 13 favored enemies seems to fit.
