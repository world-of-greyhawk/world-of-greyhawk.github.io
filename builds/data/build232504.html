Nice, though EMA is hardly useful in a decent magic level environment (with +5 items you'll only get +5 AC (the Dodge AC part) from it), and thus I feel it is not worth an epic feat, especially when you don't have Epic Warding. Epic Warding is definitely the best epic spell and should always be picked first. If you don't have extra feats I feel that it's the only Epic Spell worth picking; I'd rather get more Great X's or Armor Skin or Epic Prowess or such feats than the lesser Epic Spells (a Caster 38/X 1/Y 1 might be different, however even in this case I feel that Spell Focuses and Great X's are worth more than the Epic Spells).<br><br>Decent build anyhow, though not the first of its kind. It's customary to credit other builds with the same classes (and if there are ridiculously many, at least list the ones with similar level distribution/goals and motives).

I don't usually use the search engine unless I'm looking for a specific build.

50/+20 DR for 16 rounds vs +5-+20 AC for 16 hours seems a good trade-off to me. Also, Epic DR doesn't stack with warding and is always active. I don't feel having both EDR and EW is useful for a build.<br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while

Hmmm, very interesting.  He gets all the important things by Level 30, which enhances his playability for most Epic Mods (something I take into consideration for almost any character I play anymore-- can I get everything by Level 30?, etc.)<br><br>Seems like he should hold his own in any environment.  The sonic resistance seems like a good idea, though I might lean towards Fire, Electrical or even Acid.  Cold might even be a thought in case you have one of those party members who likes to chaincast Icestorms.<br><br>I don't see anything I would really change.  Something to consider would be taking Heavy Armor Proficiency over Toughness.  Not only does it improve AC up front in pre-epic, you really no longer have to worry about being caught Flat-footed and losing your Dex AC.  It would also, combined with UMD, pretty much allow you to have the choice to wear whatever you want.  But such decisions are best left to  players environment.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Good point about the heavy armor griz, since this build has a fairly low dexterity, he wouldn't loose all that much using a plate if the environment provides better plates than medium armors.<br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while
