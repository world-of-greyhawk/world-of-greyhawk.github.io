Yes, another shifter build with Dragon in mind but this level split is unique.  I'll explain after the build:<br><br>Dragon Tank	 	Human Druid(25) / Monk(2) / Shifter(13) <br><br>Str	8 	<br>Dex	10 	<br>Con	14 	<br>Int	14 	<br>Wis	18(31)<br>Cha	8<br><br><b>Playable 1-40 PvM</b><br>Alignment: Lawful &lt;any&gt;<br><br>(1)  Druid		Alertness, Heavy Armor Prof<br>(2)  Druid		<br>(3)  Druid		WF - Unarmed<br>(4)  Druid						(Wis)<br>(5)  Druid		<br>(6)  Druid		Extend Spell<br>(7)  Druid		<br>(8)  Druid						(Wis)<br>(9)  Shifter		Blind Fight<br>(10) Shifter		<br>(11) Shifter		<br>(12) Shifter		Imp Crit - Unarmed Strike	(Wis)<br>(13) Shifter<br>(14) Shifter<br>(15) Shifter		Expertise<br>(16) Druid						(Wis)<br>(17) Druid<br>(18) Druid		Toughness(or Knockdown)<br>(19) Druid<br>(20) Shifter						(Wis)<br>(21) Druid		Great Wis	<br>(22) Monk<br>(23) Shifter		<br>(24) Shifter		Undead Shape			(Wis)<br>(25) Shifter<br>(26) Shifter	<br>(27) Shifter		EWF - Unarmed, Great Wis II<br>(28) Druid						(Wis)<br>(29) Druid		<br>(30) Druid		Construct Shape<br>(31) Druid		<br>(32) Druid						(Wis)<br>(33) Druid		Great Wis III<br>(34) Druid		<br>(35) Druid			<br>(36) Druid		Armor Skin			(Wis)<br>(37) Monk<br>(38) Druid		<br>(39) Druid		Epic Prowess, Dragon Shape<br>(40) Druid						(Wis)<br><br>AB		28/25/22/19/16<br>Damage	1-6 -1 19-20x2<br>BAB		25<br>Base AC	30<br>HP		440(Max)<br><br>Saves:<br>Fort		26 (+9 vs Spells)<br>Reflex		20 (+9 vs Spells)<br>Will		30 (+9 vs Spells)<br><br>Concentration	43<br>Discipline	40<br>Heal		43<br>Hide		40<br>Move Silently	40<br>Spellcraft	43 (45)<br>Tumble		40<br><br>Dragon Form:<br>AB		48/45/42/39/36<br>Damage	2-16+19 19-20x2<br>BAB		25<br>Base AC	63<br>HP		*<br><br>Breath Weapons:<br>Fire		22d10<br>Electrical	22d8<br>Acid		22d6<br>DC of 34 for all Breath Weapons<br><br>Saves:<br>Fort		35 (+9 vs Spells)<br>Reflex		33 (+9 vs Spells)<br>Will		31 (+9 vs Spells)<br><br>2 levels of Monk - This is for playability.  You can wait until level 22 to maximize your BAB or you can take it earlier to reap the benefits sooner.  Wis bonus to AC, Evasion, etc.<br><br>25 levels of Druid - This was done to try and gain the benefits of a strong buffer but retain a strong dragon form.  You are immune up to greater dispelling and Mord's only has a 20% chance to break through.  We all know what a pain it is to lose all your buffs while shifted.  You can max your wisdom with just owl's insight.  You get all druid spells and extended they will last as long as you do.  Spell Resistance buffs at 37 too, which is nice.<br><br>13 levels of Shifter - Need 11 for Construct Shape and you get a bonus feat for just 2 more.  Since this build focuses on unarmed attacks, Construct makes a natural 2nd choice.<br><br>A fully buffed str will give you 54AB which ain't too shabby.  Combined with 5 attacks and awesome damage, this should place you well within reach of killing most things.  Combine this with monk levels for evasion and AC wis bonus, you can tank most enemies.  I'm still tinkering with toughness or knockdown.  Personal choice I suppose.  <br><br>His breath is nothing to sneeze at either. (pun intended <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">       ) <br><br>Dragon shape can be reached by level 36, but it means swapping Armor Skin with a Druid bonus feat.  I usually don't end builds on odd stats i.e. 31 but felt this build still worked with it.<br><br>Undead shape was added at 24 to add more playability.  Your non epic forms are going to get long in the tooth until you get Construct Shape at lvl 30.  If you wanted an even wisdom, you could grab another great wisdom here.<br><br>Feel free to offer suggestions as they are most welcome.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/" target="_blank">http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 12/26/05 15:56</span></i></p>

at first glance three things strike me.<br><br>Firstly, Heavy Armor Proficiency and yet no Still Spell?<br>What is the purpose of the Armor Proficiency? I thought Monk Speed, AC and WIS AC bonus are lost when wearing armor/ shield, so I don't see the benefit in this feat.<br><br>Secondly, I can see the benefit of taking another epic shape to improve playability in epic levels, but taking three in total, when you appear to be focussing on dragon shape as the outcome seems excessive to me. <br><br>Thirdly, Do you really need shifter levels at all? The point being that you don't need them to open Dragon Shape.<br><br>Just a few thoughts

When he shifts he will be wearing no armor and therefore he will get WIS bonus to AC<br><br>Actually I'd take outsider shape (rakshasa!!!) instead of construct shape, but that's just personal preference<br>Pity for the odd WIS, maybe I'd drop epic prowess to even it out...or maybe not<br><br>Cheers<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

The three epic shapes offer playability as well as versatility.<br><br>When shifted, the only thing left in your inventory is a weapon if the shape uses one.  So, you do get any monk benfits including wis AC.<br><br>Shifter levels are required for construct shape which is very powerful since you get all the immunities of undead without the hassle of fearing heals and turning.  They also add to the more powerful breath ability of the Dragon.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/" target="_blank">http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Talamier on 12/16/05 20:31</span></i></p>

For shifter, a breath weapon in a build without EPIC shifter counts as being 10 levels lower, and really makes the breath weapon unusable mostly.<br><br>I want to point out another thing, I have played a dragon. Since you can't get your melee damage type to anything but slashing, a character with slashing resistance or just plain DR will cause some trouble. That's why you need the breath weapon to be usable.<br><br>A dragon truly rocks the house with max +5 weapons availible.
