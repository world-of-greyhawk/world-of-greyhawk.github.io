<b>Playable from level 1 to 40... PvP or PvM</b> <br><br>This is the build for people who don't like to buff, but still want something as powerful as a cleric.  Is it as powerful as a cleric?  No, that can't be done, but with +5 equipment it can manage a higher AB than most clerics and with improved expertise it can manage a similar AC.  So you kind of have to choose between having the AB of a cleric or the AC of a cleric (with expertise mode you come pretty close to having both) but of course you never have the spell casting of the cleric.   The one advantage of this build, is you never have to buff and you can't be dispelled.  Also the nasty critical hits come in handy.  In higher magic settings, this build will start doing better and in terms of melee capability will end up better than the cleric.  This build should do best in mid to high magic settings (where you can still hit an opponent on something other than a 20) and devastating critical has been banned.<br><br>There are a few Bard/Fighter/Weapon Masters with similar level distributions.  The closest would be my own <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "139688", "0", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Master of Melee v. 2</a>, Fernandooa's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "198055", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Improved Kukri Master</a> Tyr Templar's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "246241", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Blade</a> and <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "246108", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Curse Blade</a> and SovranSpecific's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "206803", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Humming Hurricane of Horror v1</a> and <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "206857", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>v2</a>.  First I'll compare it to the Master of Melee v. 2, the master uses a scythe and has DR and more hitpoints, but trades some AB for it.  The Improved Kukri Master, Blade and Curse Blade go for devastating critical.  Lastly, SovranSpecific's builds dual wield and go for overwhelming critical which costs a great deal of defence in comparison to this build (improved expertise, the knockdown feats and blind-fight).  There really isn't a Fighter/WM/bard that goes sword and board without devastating critical in the guild so I figured I would post one.  This is a powerful combo, which has many viable variations.  Hopefully, this will be considered one of the better ones.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-Great AB.  One off of the human strength maximum.<br>-Good AC.  Around the best an armor wearer can expect, plus it can be boosted by the expertise feats.<br>-Good HP.  In the mid 500s is pretty good for a melee build.<br>-Maxed out UMD.  It can use equipment from other classes.<br>-Pretty good taunt skill.  It can taunt an opponent with no concentration for even more AB.<br><br><b>Disadvantages</b><br><br>-Poor Saves.  The saves are mediocre vs. spells, except for the will save which is horrible.  The low fortitude save is due to weapon master having reflex as its high save as opposed to fortitude like every other full AB class.  Against anything other than spells the saves are horrible.<br><br><b>Assault and Battery</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Human<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Any non lawful<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 17<br>DEX 13<br>CON 14<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>All 10 increase Strength<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Bard 3<br>Fighter 12<br>Weapon Master 25<br><br><i>Level Distribution and Feats</i><br>Level 1: (Fighter 1): Dodge, Expertise, Weapon Focus (Warhammer)<br>Level 2: (Fighter 2): Knockdown<br>Level 3: (Fighter 3): Mobility<br>Level 4: (Fighter 4): Weapon Specialization (Warhammer)<br>Level 5: (Fighter 5)<br>Level 6: (Fighter 6): Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack<br>Level 7: (Weapon Master 1)<br>Level 8: (Weapon Master 2)<br>Level 9: (Weapon Master 3): Improved Knockdown<br>Level 10: (Weapon Master 4)<br>Level 11: (Weapon Master 5)<br>Level 12: (Weapon Master 6): Improved Critical (Warhammer)<br>Level 13: (Weapon Master 7)<br>Level 14: (Fighter 7)<br>Level 15: (Fighter 8 ) : Toughness, Blind-Fight<br>Level 16: (Fighter 9)<br>Level 17: (Fighter 10): Improved Expertise<br>Level 18: (Weapon Master 8 ) : Called Shot<br>Level 19: (Weapon Master 9)<br>Level 20: (Weapon Master 10)<br>Level 21: (Weapon Master 11): Great Strength I<br>Level 22: (Bard 1)<br>Level 23: (Weapon Master 12)<br>Level 24: (Weapon Master 13): Great Strength II, Epic Weapon Focus (Warhammer)<br>Level 25: (Fighter 11)<br>Level 26: (Fighter 12): Epic Weapon Specialization (Warhammer)<br>Level 27: (Weapon Master 14): Great Strength III<br>Level 28: (Weapon Master 15)<br>Level 29: (Weapon Master 16): Epic Prowess<br>Level 30: (Weapon Master 17): Great Strength IV<br>Level 31: (Weapon Master 18)<br>Level 32: (Bard 2)<br>Level 33: (Weapon Master 19): Armor Skin, Great Strength V<br>Level 34: (Weapon Master 20)<br>Level 35: (Weapon Master 21)<br>Level 36: (Weapon Master 22): Great Strength VI, Epic Toughness I<br>Level 37: (Weapon Master 23)<br>Level 38: (Weapon Master 24)<br>Level 39: (Weapon Master 25): Great Strength VII, Epic Toughness II<br>Level 40: (Bard 3)<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 34<br>DEX 13<br>CON 14<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>AB and Damage</i><br>(no buffs, mundane warhammer)<br>52/47/42/37 18+1D8 (17-20 x4)<br><br>(+12 to Strength, +5 keen warhammer, haste, bard song)<br>64/59/54/49/64 31+1D8 (16-20 x4)<br><br><i>AC</i><br>22 (no buffs, no equipment)<br>33 (Full Plate, Tower Shield)<br>62 (+5 Full Plate, +5 Tower Shield, +5 Ring of Protection, +5 Amulet of Natural Armor, +5 Boots of the Sun Soul, Haste)<br>72 (As above with improved expertise)<br><br><i>Final Saves (Vs.

If you screw imp expertise and thoughness and the 2 additonal (somehow pretty much useless) bard lvls (nice for lvling but thats it) and take 14 fighter you can fit dev in without loosing ab or gr str feats. loose 80hps though..worth it if u get dev as you kill faster.However not every server allows dev..in that case , why not imp disarm?

I didn't build this character for a devastating critical server, nor would I play him on one.  His AC isn't high enough and his fortitude save isn't good enough to survive against devastating critical.  The improved expertise choice is mostly a PvM choice. With improved expertise his AB drops to 42, that is about the same as most rogues and even some melee builds, so when you add in magical equipment it is good enough to hit with.  By the same token his AC increases to monk and PM levels making him much harder to hit.  One on one, it is better to fight without expertise mode.  Against multiple enemies, improved expertise can be a life saver.  PvP, the disarm feats would probably be better.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
