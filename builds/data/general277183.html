How is the Health Points of a character calculated? I want to know the max I can get from a fighter each level, WM each level, and monk at each level, when I have a con of 16 from the beginning.

When you level up, you should read the class text.  That will tell you what range of hitpoints a character class gets.<br><br>Fighters get 1d10 HP each level up.<br><br>Add/Subtract Con ability modifier to that.<br>Add potential Toughness feat bonus HP.<br>Add potential class specific HP bonus (Palemaster HP bonus).<br><br>For the first three levels of your character, they receive a max roll on HPs.  Particular PW servers may have local rules on that.

Look for HD or Hitdice. Sheesh, it has been while since I have played NWN... lol. But hopefully the information I have given is accurate.<br><br>It should look something like this... HD: d10 for fighter, etc..., HD: d12 for barbarian and dwarven defender. And so on...<br><br>To answer your previous question, Fighter = d10, Monk = d8, and Weapon Master = d10.<br><br>Since I do not know how many levels you will be taking for them... I will provide an example of maximum HP you could get for the combo you mentioned. And the CON at 16.<br><br>18 Fighter/6 Monk/16 Weapon Master<br><br>W/O Toughness<br>-F = 234 HP<br>-M = 66 HP<br>-WM = 208 HP<br>Total = 508 HP<br><br>With Toughness feat<br>-F = 252 HP<br>-M = 72 HP<br>-WM = 224<br>Total = 548<br><br>Of course, you will have to factor in every time you add an CON modifier at level up. That changes the number you will get for that specific level.<br><br>Let me remember how that works... I believe it adds the character level to the max HP of the class hitdice...<br><br>For example... if you have increased the CON from 16 to 18, increasing the CON twice. At level 20, that is if you have adjusted the CON to 18 as you level up on 20th level, you will get 34 HP(W/O Toughness) or 35HP(W/Toughness) if you level up as fighter.<br><br>I believe the math is accurate... although it has been while since I have done the math... if anyone spots mistake... please correct me. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Oh, and here's how to do the math...<br><br>(CHD+CM)*CL + (CHD+CM)*CL + (CHD+CM)*CL, that is if you have three different classes... (CHD = Class Hitdice + Con ability modifier) * Class level.<br><br>As for other part of math... I explained the details of how to deal with CON modifiers. The math shown just now only gives you maximum HP if you don't increase the CON during the character's life.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Anuis on 06/26/07 06:53</span></i></p>
