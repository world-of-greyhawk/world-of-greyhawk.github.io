This character build which I would call 'Freak of Nature' is a Human Bard/Pale Master/Red Dragon Disciple. He will have immunities to critical hits, fire, paralysis, hole, stun, and sleep. You can choose to have a martial weapon proficiency and/or select another weapon. With about 40 ranks in tumble his final naked AC will be 36. Put on some armor, shields, and other items and he will be extremely hard to hit. His greater undead summon will be a skeletal blackguard<br>Bard 6/PM 20/RDD 14<br><br>Starting STATS: Final STATS:<br>STR 16 STR: 34<br>DEX 14 DEX: 14<br>CON 12 CON: 14<br>INT 12 INT: 14<br>WIS 8 WIS: 8<br>CHA 12 CHA: 14<br>Put all ability points in strength<br>* denotes Pale Master Bonus Feats<br>+ denotes RDD Bonus Feats<br>FEATS<br>1 Weapon Proficiency Exotic, Power Attack<br>3 Cleave<br>6 Weapon Focus<br>9 Great Cleave<br>12 Improved Critical<br>15 Toughness<br>18 Curse Song<br>21 Overwhelming Critical<br>24 Devastating Critical<br>27 Epic Weapon Focus<br>28 Epic Energy Resistance I (Cold)*<br>30 Epic Spell Epic Mage Armor<br>31 Epic Energy Resistance II (Cold)*<br>33 Epic Prowess<br>35 Armor Skin +<br>36 Epic Spell Epic Warding<br>37 Epic Energy Resistance III (Cold)*<br>39 Epic Spell Greater Ruin<br><br>Edited By BRIAN FELLOW on 03/09/04 11:37:54<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 10/12/07 19:35</span></i></p>

I'm curious why this person went with 14 levels of RDD. Is there much point past level 10? From what I've experienced, the dragon breath is fairly useless. <br><br>I'd go Bard 10/PM 20/RDD 10. Your bard song/ curse song will be a bit stronger, and I don't think you'll lose much of an attack bonus, would you? I'll have to try this out and get back.<br><br>Also, I think I'd do this with a Dwarf, just because that would be more "freak"ish, and you've got some extra feats in there anyway that aren't entirely necessary, like the Cold Resistence. I'd sub an increase in DEX for an increase in CON.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Xeroyne on 12/27/04 21:30</span></i></p>

Made the character a Dwarf and ended up with STR 28 and CON 22. Traded Epic spells for Epic Damage Reduction, and went only 18 levels in PM for the Vampire Mage, and 12 in Bard for a better Bard song. <br><br>Disappointing thing about this build is the low # of attacks per round- only 3 unhasted?
