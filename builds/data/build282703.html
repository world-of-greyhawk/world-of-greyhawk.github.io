I'm not that good with stories, and its late... and there are so many paladin stories out there allready.<br><br>The class "Champion of Tyr" is not a PRC class, I just felt like calling it that instead of Torm, since Tyr favours the Longsword, the alignement, domains and other things. And they are both "CoT" in short.<br><br>This one is similiar to evo_dragon's True Champion of Torm <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "132025", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>I however believe this one have sufficent differences to be posted anyway, and my version may be easier to level in early levels.<br><br>The Holyboy/Champion of Tyr<br><br>Lv 1-40, PvM - PvP (untested)<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignement: Lawful/Good<br><br>Abilities:<br>Str: 14<br>Dex: 8<br>Con: 14<br>Wis: 15 (18)<br>Int: 12<br>Cha: 14 (28)<br><br><br>Paladin 5/Cleric 15/Cot 20<br><br>Lv1: Paladin: Weapon Focus: Longsword, Power Attack<br>Lv2: Paladin<br>Lv3: Paladin: Extra Turning<br>Lv4: Paladin: Wis+1<br>Lv5: Paladin<br>Lv6: Cleric: Extend Spell, Domains: Strength and War<br>Lv7: Cleric<br>Lv8: Cleric: Wis+1<br>Lv9: Champion Of Tyr: Extra Smiting<br>Lv10: CoT: Cleave<br>Lv11: CoT<br>Lv12: CoT: Toughness, Great Cleave: Wis+1<br>Lv13: CoT<br>Lv14: CoT: Blind Fight<br>Lv15: Cleric: Divine Shield<br>Lv16: Cleric: Cha+1<br>Lv17: CoT<br>Lv18: Cleric: Divine Might<br>Lv19: Cleric<br>Lv20: CoT: Improved Critical: Longsword: Cha+1<br><br>Epic Level Progression<br><br>Lv21: CoT: Greath Charisma<br>Lv22: CoT: Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword<br>Lv23: Cleric<br>Lv24: Cleric: Great Charisma: Cha+1<br>Lv25: Cleric<br>Lv26: Cleric<br>Lv27: Cleric: Great Charisma<br>Lv28: Cleric: Cha+1<br>Lv29: Cleric<br>Lv30: CoT: Great Charisma<br>Lv31: CoT<br>Lv32: CoT: Cha+1<br>Lv33: CoT: Great Charisma, Epic Prowess<br>Lv34: CoT<br>Lv35: CoT<br>Lv36: CoT: Great Charisma: Cha+1<br>Lv37: CoT: Armour Skin<br>Lv38: CoT<br>Lv39: Cleric: Great Charisma<br>Lv40: CoT: Cha+1<br><br>Skills:<br>Discipline: 43<br>Spellcraft: 42<br>Concetration: 42<br>Tumble: 20<br>Open lock: 1<br>Disable trap: 1<br>Points left: 1<br><br>HPs: 490 maxed<br>With +6 con buffed: 750<br>Aid: +1d8 each cast, yup the HP bonus stacks, endlessly.<br><br>Paladin levels: Max Discipline and Concentration.<br>Cleric levels: Max Concentration and Spellcraft<br>CoT levels: Max Discipline<br><br>Cleric Spells:<br>Lv1: 7 slots<br>Lv2: 7 slots<br>Lv3: 7 slots<br>Lv4: 6 slots<br>Lv5: 5 slots<br>Lv6: 4 slots<br>Lv7: 3 slots<br>Lv8: 2 slots<br><br>Paladin Spells:<br>Lv1: 1 slot<br><br>Saves: <br><br>Fort: 46<br>Ref: 37<br>Will: 41<br><br>+8 to all vs spells<br>Possible +2 to all from eagles, and further +6 to Ref and Con from skills and cats+endurance.<br>+1 from Prayer<br>+2 from Battletide.<br><br>BAB: 18<br>AB with mundane longsword: +34/+29/+24/+19<br>AC: Robes 15, Fullplate/towershield: 26<br><br>Buffing:<br><br>Key spells/skills:<br><br>Aura of Vitality: +4 con, dex and str for 15 rounds, can extend.<br>Battle Mastery: +4 con, dex, AB and damage and 8/? DR for up to 16 rounds with a good Eagles Splendor.<br>Divine Strength: +7 Str for up to 16 rounds with a good Eagles Splendor.<br>(I think I got the numbers right on the two domain skills)<br><br>These three give a total of: +8 Con, +8 Dex, +11 Str, +4 AB and Damage(not counting str bonus) and 8/?

Thats a total of 2d8+12 each hit on you.<br>Protection from elements and so on enhances survivability.<br><br>Thats all there is for numbers today. (Do tell me what numbers are wrong, sine I know there are a bunch of them that are)<br><br>Strengths:<br>High damage if given time to prepare.<br>Decent hps.

(Aura of vitality, divine wrath, divine shield and might, battle mastery, divine strength.)<br>Lay on Hands for 25*9 or 25*11 (buffed or not) for 225-275 hps.<br><br>Weaknesses:<br>Short duration on the major buffs and skills.<br>Spends a long time to fully buff, more spells and skills than avaliable quickslots.<br>So many buffing spells its easy to forget some, doesent reach full potential unless you know the build extremely well.<br>Require alot of preparation.<br>Only a medicore fighter until epic levels and cleric spells hit in.<br>No combat casting, has to prepare in advance of taste the opportunity attacks.<br>Low DC on spells, all should be used for buffing.<br>Dispellable. (mages=oh shoot...)<br><br><br><br>This build is meant for low-maigc worlds (where +4 is the absolute max obtainable, and items dont give more than +2 to abilities)<br>For +5 worlds and more, just make a dev-critter like everyone else...<br><br>I think that covers everything...<br><br>Oh yea, sorry about the Barbaric Shaman. I... Could'nt think of anything good so I made this one up instead. Way to spend a friday night... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">
