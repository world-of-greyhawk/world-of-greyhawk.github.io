This build was inevitable, so I went ahead and did it in my spare time, even if its not my usual style. . . <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>You always see posts about people who want their Dragon builds to have DevCrit, but since Bios classes dont support DevCrit(creatture), it cant happen without the benefit of the very nice PnPShifter class.   Besides the pre-reqs for both DevCrit and Dragon Shape are very high, and only a very few builds could do it.  Well, here is one of those builds, for the Crit-inclined. . . .<br><br>The minimum pre-reqs for Bios DevCrit are not quite as documented, and PnPShifters DevCrit did it too.  This build takes advantage of that, although it doesnt really NEED to, to work.   Weapon Focus is not really required.  This is more than just a 2da mistake, I think; more of a limitation of the current 2da format.  As I see it, they dont have enough "feat required" slots to do all pre-reqs for Overwhelming Crit.  Weapon Focus is a natural thing to want though, but in a feat-restricted build like this, I chose not to get it.<br>  <br>These shapes (and some lesser shapes as well) will all have access to DevCrit(creature).  All but Construct is available in this build, although if you want Construct, you can take one of the other shapes out.<br><br>Dragon - All Shapes<br>Construct - All Shapes<br>Undead - Vampire, Spectre<br>Outsider - Deah Slaad Lord<br>Wildshape 4-  Large Dire Tiger<br>WildShape 3 - Manticore, Basilisk<br><br><br>Half-Orc  9/3/28 Druid PnPShifter Shifter<br>Neutral Good (Needs to be good for Intuitive attack)<br><br>Str 19 (25)<br>Dex 8<br>Con 9<br>Wis 18 (30)<br>Int 6<br>Cha 6<br><br>1 Druid Alertness<br>2 Druid<br>3 Druid Pow Attack<br>4 Druid Str20<br>5 Druid<br>6 Druid Cleave<br>7 Druid<br>8 Druid Str21 <br>9 Shifter Extend<br>10 Shifter<br>11 Shifter<br>12 Shifter Str22  Great Cleave<br>13 Shifter<br>14 Shifter<br>15 Shifter Intuitive attack  (or Zen Archery)<br>16 Shifter Str23<br>17 Shifter<br>18 PnPShifter ImpCrit(Creature)<br>19 Shifter<br>20 Druid  Str24<br><br>9/1/10  BAB 13<br> <br>21 PnPShifter  OCrit<br>22 Shifter<br>23 Shifter<br>24 Shifter13 Str25  W19 GW20<br>25 Shifter<br>26 Shifter<br>27 PnPShifter  DCrit<br>28 Shifter16 Wis21, Undead Shape<br>29 Shifter<br>30 Shifter  GWis22  <br>31 Shifter19 GWis23<br>32 Shifter Wis24<br>33 Shifter GWis25<br>34 Shifter22          Outsider Shape<br>35 Shifter <br>36 Shifter  Wis26  GreatWis27<br>37 Shifter25 GWis28<br>38 Shifter<br>39 Shifter  GreatWis29 <br>40 Shifter28 Wis30 Dragon Shape <br><br>AC 21 (Breast Plate and Tower Shield)<br><br>AB 33/28/23 with club<br>d6+7<br><br>AB 30/25/20 with Scimitar (Intuitive attack doesnt apply, and maybe wasnt worth it?)<br><br>Saves<br>--------<br>Fort 24<br>Reflex 21<br>Will 29<br><br>Skill points 86 total<br>-------- -------<br>Do what you want with the few you have; I did:<br>20 Spellcraft<br>20 Tumble<br><br><br>Dragon Stats:<br>------------------<br><br>Ancient Red Dragon<br>AC 47<br>HP 790<br>AB 42/37/32<br>2d6+19 attacks<br>Fort 36<br>Reflex 35<br>Will 29<br>SR 20<br><br><br>Pros<br>------<br>- DevCrit in lots of Shapes<br><br>Cons<br>-------<br>- If you like DevCrit enough to nerf your other stats so much , does anything else matter? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Normal kids play rock-paper-scissors.<br>Shifter kids play IronGolem-RustMonster-MindFlayer. . .
