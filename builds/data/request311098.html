I wanted to mix items from the Epic Sorc build with being crit/sneak immune and also pull some items in from rev matt's crazy sorc dwarf.  This is what I came up with.  It's far more versatile then a sorc can be since it can get all spells and prepare with them when needed although obviously a difference in number of casts at the higher levels.  For example my exalted sorc had 9 casts of (3) different level 9 spells when I was 22 or so.  This char would have 5 or so depending on gear but could be out of ANY level 9 spells as opposed to sorcs which would most likely be bigby's, mords and 1 more (depending on server.<br><br>I'm not going to do the official crazy formatting build post because I don't consider it an epic build more of a modification of existing builds.
