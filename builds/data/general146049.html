Dragon shape Dev.Critter, is this possible?<br>I have a build with dragon shape and dev.crit but i dont see the fort role vs death when i crit. So iam guessing that dev.crit in unarmed wont give you dev.crit as dragon. Or am i wrong? It dossent work if iam EarthElemental ether.. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif"> <br><br>The build: Druid/Monk/Cot - 18/4/18

That's correct evo. Even though the dragon says it is unarmed, it uses a skin for the weapon slot. You can see the stats for it in the toolset (as well as a few others).

The problem is... You can't get both. You must have 30 WIS to get Dragon Shape, and 25 STR for Devastating Critical. It is not possible to do both.<br><br>Anuis

It may be possible with a bard/rdd/druid. It would mean sacrificing just about everything else just about. Start with 16 Str and WIS. Use RDD for the STR to get to dev crit and All stats and great WIS for getting 30 WIS. Regardless the character would be severely handicapped putting all it's eggs in one basket so to speak.

Of course to even do this you would need to be half orc and start with 18 str and 18 wis(as far as I can figure), but a Druid/Bard/RDD could manage it easily.<br><br>As for increasing the attack of the dragon shape, my understanding was that WF unarmed strike didn't work(but some have told me it worked for them <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif"> ), but imp crit unarmed strike does work for it.  Epic prowness is definetly a must for a shifter IMO, the +1 to any weapon will be useful no matter what shape you take.

This build was a human, takeing the CoT lvls jsut as you hit lvl 20. This will allowed you to get 30wis in notime.<br><br>And you dont need more then 14lvls of druid to get dragon shape there for i changed it to 14/6/18 to get iKD<br><br>The reason dev.crit issent working is simply, as you ppl said, dragon dont use "unarmed". I reserced in this and found out that no feats that will make ab or dammage greater for "unarmed" will work when you in dragon shape.(other then monks "bonus ab") Only "imp.crit Unarmed" dose...

FYI, this IS possible using the PRC.<br><br>Their PnP Shifter can get a Dragon shape without the massive Wisdom pre-reqs, and thier PnPSHifter class has the required feats all the way up to DevCrit(Creature). Its most definitely NOT the same Shifter as Bio did; not really better or worse, just a different style.<br>_________________<br>Normal kids play rock-paper-scissors.<br>Shifter kids play IronGolem-RustMonster-MindFlayer. . .
