I think you forgot to list your stats.<br><br>Also, I'd take devastating critical as a fighter bonus feat instead of a normal feat. This would let you take another Great Strength. Of course, this would be at the cost of an Epic Toughness feat, but I think the trade is worth it.

Of course, this would be at the cost of an Epic Toughness feat, but I think the trade is worth it.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Heh--thanks for catching that. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    That's what I get for condensing from my build document using a format similar to Bioware's posted epic builds--I condensed out the stats.  D'oops!<br><br>Starting Stats: Str 18, Dex 13, Con 12, Int 13, Wis 8, Cha 8<br>Ending Stats: Str 34, Dex 13, Con 12, Int 13, Wis 8, Cha 8<br><br>As for taking Dev Crit as a fighter bonus feat, yes, that'd let you get another Great Strength for a final strength of 35, but at the cost of either 2 AC (Armor Skin), +1 BAB (Epic Prowess), or 20 HP (Epic Toughness).  Plus you would not get Dev Crit as early.  And that extra strength point is all but useless, IMHO.<br><br>However, if you were to do an alternate of this build, a half-orc starting with Str 19, Dex 13, Con 12, Int 13, Wis 8, Cha 6, then you could make the following changes to the feat progression:<br>...<br>23. BF: Devastating Critical (greatsword) even earlier!<br>24. Great Strength II<br>25. BF: Epic Weapon Focus (greatsword)<br>27. Great Strength III, BF: Epic Weapon Specialization (greatsword)<br>...<br>40. Great Strength VII, BF: Epic Prowess<br><br>This loses 20 HP, but gains 2 STR (+1 AB) and one point of damage per hit (3 points of damage per critical).<br><br>(I haven't tested this half-orc alternate, but it should work out.)<br><br>A human variant of the elf build is easy--identical stats, and one extra feat to play with at level one, and one additional skill you can fully develop.  So give the human weapon proficiency exotic, have him sub scythe for greatsword, play with the extra skill points as you wish, and you've got that classic archetype.  Or just give him Luck of Heroes at level one for better saves, make him a Torm worshipper, and take levels 14-19 as Champion of Torm, for +4 to all saves.<br><br>Dwarf starting stats would be Str 18, Dex 13, Con 14, Int 13, Wis 8, Cha 6--this nets an additional 40 hit points due to the boosted Con.  Replace greatsword with greataxe if desired.<br><br>Halfling and gnome variants are a bit more complex.  Starting stats will be Str 16, Dex 13, Con 14, Int 13, Wis 8, Cha 8.  Greatsword should be replaced with a weapon like rapier or warhammer.<br><br>Feat progression in epic levels must be altered to reflect the lower strength:<br><br>...<br>21. Great Strength I, BF: Epic Weapon Focus (rapier)<br>23. BF: Epic Weapon Specialization (rapier)<br>24. Overwhelming Critical (rapier)<br>25. BF: Epic Prowess<br>27. Great Strength II, BF: Armor Skin<br>29. BF: Devastating Critical (rapier)<br>...<br><br>(Strength for gnomes and haffers will end at 32, not 34.)<br><br>For the perfect katana master, take a halfling (or gnome) and adjust the initial 4 levels as follows:<br><br>1. Weapon Proficiency Exotic, BF: Weapon Focus (katana)<br>2. BF: Dodge<br>3. Expertise<br>4. BF: Mobility<br>...<br><br>and levels 15-18 as follows:<br><br>...<br>15. Power Attack, BF: Weapon Specialization (katana)<br>17. BF: Cleave<br>18. Great Cleave<br>...<br><br>The halfling katana master is pretty much the first build I took through HotU (though I think I took Power Attack at 12 and moved Toughness somewhere in the 15-19 range).  Very fun to play if you want to take a break from the finger-waggling. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Nukenin on 02/27/05 04:33</span></i></p>

Human pretty much has identical stats, just an additional feat at 1st level and 43 more skill points to play with.  Dwarf gets to work in a higher Con for more HPs, at the expense of being a bit more difficult to get along with (lower Cha).

However, you would get +4 to your AB (attack bonus) from taking a full 30 levels of weapon master (maybe even +5, I'm not sure if superior weapon focus goes up at level 10 weapon master or not, but it will increase at 15, 20, 25, and 30).<br><br>In a variant of my build, you could simply take weapon master to 10 pre-epic (i.e. levels 7 through 16 or any other combination giving you the full 10 pre-epic)--you will have to sacrifice one of the fighter bonus feats.  Then take all 20 epic levels as weapon master, and simply sacrifice three of the epic toughness feats (60 hit points) and epic weapon specialization (see below) and shuffle the other bonus feats around a bit to fit the every-three-level WM progression.<br><br>However, this will cost you epic weapon specialization.  An alternative is to keep the listed pre-epic progression (13 fighter/7 weapon master) and take the 14th fighter level at 21 as listed, to get both epic weapopn focus and specialization out of the way, then take the remaining 19 levels as weapon master.  This costs you +1 potential AB from going to the full 30 weapon master levels possible, but the +4 damage is well worth it, IMHO.<br><br>So it comes down to trading 60 hit points and for +3 (or +4, again depending on whether you get an additional +1 at WM level 10) AB.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;I've also been told it's impossible to finish SOU &amp; HOTU at lvl 40, that it will be more likely you'll finish at around lvl 26.

The build as specified delivers devastating critical by level 24, which gives you some time at the end of HotU to hopefully benefit from it (my halfling katana master did not get DevCrit by the end of HotU, alas, due to lower starting strength and probably also due to whatever on-the-fly development mistakes I may have made).<br><br>Any build I post here will be optimized for a fun (for me, anyway!) SoU/HotU experience, as I don't (yet!) play multiplayer PvM/PvP so my builds don't ever see level 40 except when testing (though I hope to discover a good HotU follow-on experience to build my characters a bit further along the build plans I've written up, without jarring the integrity of their background coming from the SoU/HotU stories.<br><br>Thanks for the questions and feel free to ask any more you may have. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Theoretically you can have a weapon of choice for each weapon master bonus feat. So 7 is the max , one at levels 1,13,16,19,22,25,28<br><br>Syrath

I like how you balanced it and waited it out 'til epic levels before you got all your bonus fighter feats. I don't typically make very many fighters with over 10 fighter levels because it's just too many useless feats.
