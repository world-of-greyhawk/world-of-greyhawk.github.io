This build is an attempt at creating a flexible Dwarven Defender that not only can shrug damage, but that can also not receive some of it thanks to his clerical buffs.  In addtion to being able to tank for a group, he also has a more punch in solo play and will be able to take down ennemies faster thanks to the weapon master levels.  The ability to cast himself full heals is also very interesting!<br><br>The level progression is a bit ackward, but he will be solid throughout the build progression, gaining more and more abilities up to level 40.<br><br>Comments are welcomed!<br><br>S: 12-&gt;16<br>C: 17-&gt;22<br>W: 15-&gt;16<br>D: 13<br>I: 13<br>Ch: 6 (ugly bastard he is)<br><br>Domain = Heal, plant or trickery<br><br>1  Cl            Dodge<br>2  C2<br>3  C3            Expertise<br>4  C4                           CON 18<br>5  C5<br>6  C6            Toughness<br>7  C7<br>8  C8                           CON 19<br>9  C9            Mobility<br>10 C10<br>11     DWD1 <br>12     DWD2      Weapon Focus   CON 20<br>13     DWD3<br>14     DWD4<br>15     DWD5      Spring attack<br>16     DWD6                     CON 21<br>17     DWD7<br>18     DWD8      Whirlwind<br>19     DWD9<br>20     DWD10                    WIS 16<br>21 C11           Extend Spell<br>22           WM1<br>23           WM2<br>24           WM3 Improved Crit.

hmmm that build of yours does look familiar<br><a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=433296&amp;forum=42" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br><br>1) its too streched, too thin<br>2) since your not going str, you do get good DR-/, but your AB is not that good<br>3) in order to make a build like this work, i learned that you should do something like CL 15/WM 7/ DD 18<br>this works much better due to a fairly competent cleric, and the build is not overly streched<br><br>then again, i followed up this build with this one <br><a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=433513&amp;forum=42" target="_blank">Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By aluka on 06/09/05 01:24</span></i></p>

Sorry, I missed your build as it was not in the list.   This not a uber build by any stretch and specialized builds are definitively stronger either as a damager or as a tank.  I initially created and played a different version with Cl9/F5/DD26 that gets the damage reduction very early.  The objective here was to have a DwD that can kill things a little faster.<br><br>Skills I have put in Conc, disc and tumble<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Drallimer on 06/09/05 11:28</span></i></p>

There are 2 things that I would add to this.  1) like aluk...  take 15 cleric lvls!  2) dwarven axe!   What good is a dwarf defender build without a dwarfaxe?   Yes i know you need a feat for this, but really, with 7 wm lvls you dont really need these til later anyway!  <br><br>Peace
