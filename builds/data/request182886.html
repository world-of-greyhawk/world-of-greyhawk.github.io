Hello, i've been toying with this idea for a good week now and i just can't seem to get it to work the way i want. So i thought i'd ask here...<br><br>Ok the idea is a Dex Based Stealth Detector, He needs to have really high listen OR spot, either works. Decently High MS/Hide and Disc, at least 60ab unbuffed (with +4 weapon and +12 Dex items) and around 75ac (i have easy access to +6 ac items of any type((with no other effects)),+12 dex items(as stated earlier), easy access to a haste item for most any slot, and easy access to the +1 ac ion stone).<br><br>Epic Dodge would be nice also, but not required. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Think anyone can pull it off? Because i'll be honest i haven't been able to <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">   This is all at level 40 of course... ohh yes and must be an elf for always on detect mode. Been toying with Ranger/Monk/Rogue's and the like to no avail.<br><br>PS- Can't be an archer... sorry <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By JVStudious on 02/27/05 07:54</span></i></p>

I was informed that it can be done with 59ab and 75ac with epic dodge, but the person simply told me that it could be done and then proceeded to ignore me when i asked how... so those should prolly be the goals shot for... hehe hope that helps any, i'm still totally stumped ;-P

Ok, I was in a good mood, and a little bored today, so I did it for ya.  Let me say first off that there will be some glaring weaknesses to the build, as well as some perks that you didn't ask for.  You will have very low HPs with this char, and if your opponent is sneak immune, and you dont have elemental damage on your wep, you won't be damaging much.  Well, without further ado, I present you with "The Detector"<br><br>Elf/Chaotic Neutral (No Smites here)<br>8 Fighter/19 Wep Master/13 Rogue<br><br>Level like this:<br>6 Fighter<br>10 WM<br>2 Fighter<br>10 Rogue<br>8 WM<br>3 Rogue<br>1 WM<br><br>Feats:<br>Lv 1- Wep Finesse, Wep Focus: Rapier<br>Lv 2- Dodge (F)<br>Lv 3- Mobility<br>Lv 4- Expertise (F)<br>Lv 6- Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack (F)<br>Lv 9- Improved Crit: Rapier<br>Lv 12- Ambidexterity<br>Lv 15- 2 Wep Fighting<br>Lv 18- Imp 2 Wep Fighting, Wep Specialization: Rapier (F)<br>Lv 21- Great Dex 1<br>Lv 24- Great Dex 2<br>Lv 27- Great Dex 3<br>Lv 28- Improved Evasion (R)<br>Lv 30- Great Dex 4<br>Lv 31- Epic Wep Focus: Rapier (WM)<br>Lv 33- Great Dex 5<br>Lv 34- Epic Prowess (WM)<br>Lv 36- Great Dex 6<br>Lv 39- Defensive Roll (R), Epic Dodge<br>Lv 40- Armor Skin (WM)<br><br>()- Bonus Feats for that Class<br><br>Skills-<br>Disc- 34 (35)<br>Hide- 43 (59)<br>Move Si- 43 (55)<br>Listen- 43 (43)<br>Tumble- 40 (53)<br>UMD- 43 (41)<br><br>With a +4 Rapier, +6 Tower Shield, Robes of Dark Moon (Haste), Boots of Sun Soul +5 (+5 dodge AC, +3 dex), Cloak of Protection +6, Ammy of Natural Armor +6, Belt of Agility +9 (+9 Dex), and Bracers of Armor +6 I got:<br><br>AC- 75 (76 with your +1 AC Ion Stone)<br>AB- 60/55/50/45<br><br>There are still 2 ring slots and a helm slot open.<br><br>Pros-<br>- Met your 75 AC/60 AB Requirement<br>- Improved Evasion<br>- Epic Dodge<br>- 7d6 Sneak Damage (a bonus you weren't looking for)<br>- High UMD (can use any wand/scroll in game, and just about any class specific gear) (another bonus you weren't looking for)<br>- Great Hide/MoSi yourself, while good listen skills to spot other sneaks<br>- Reflex Save of 41!  <br>Cons-<br>- Low HP's (Max of 348 without Con Gear)<br>- Anything Crit/Sneak Immune will take you a l-o-o-o-n-g time to kill (use wands and/or scrolls here <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif">   )<br>- Will Save of 14 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  <br>- Fortitude Save of 19 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  <br>- Prolly some others, but those are the biggest<br><br>If you can get your hands on better equipment than I used, then thats even better for ya. Especially equipment that boosts your saves.<br><br>I tested this baby out in the Novice to Epic Char Builder, so I know it works.  Hope this helps ya out. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"><br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DarkStar27909 on 02/27/05 18:05</span></i></p>
