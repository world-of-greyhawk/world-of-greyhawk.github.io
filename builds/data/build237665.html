Musical Dragonkin V2 – Bard 20/RDD 10/CoT10<br><br>Well I posted this build in the main forums so some of you may have seen it, this is version 2 after some feedback and advice.<br><br>Original thread was here <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=477466&amp;forum=42" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br>The basic idea was for a Halfling with a huge sword and pretty much full bard song.  I had thought of Blackguard but 10 levels of blackguard just didn’t really add enough to the build to make it worthwhile IMO. <br><br>So I was left with fighter for feats and weapon specialisation or for CoT for a few extra feats and some saves – in the end I chose CoT, mainly for the boost to all the saves.<br><br>As a Halfling I couldn’t use a greatsword so I thought Bastard sword – as several people pointed out in the other thread on the main forums – rapier, scimitar and longsword would all count as two handed – but there’s just something about a Halfling wielding a bastard sword that I find funny! So sorry to those that suggested otherwise but I think I’m sticking with the bastard sword.<br><br>I didn’t go for heavy armour as I prefer to avoid too many arcane spellcasting failures – though most of the spells will be for buffing and used out of combat where I can strip.<br><br>Anyway – the all new tweaked build – no doubt more tweaking can and will be done.<br><br>Playable 1 – 40 PvM (don’t play pvp and odds are it would never work)<br><br>Race		Halfling<br>Alignment	Any non-evil ( I went Chaotic good)<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 	12<br>Dex 	14<br>Con 	14<br>Wis 	10<br>Int 	14<br>Cha 	14<br><br><br>Leveling<br><br>1 	Bard 1 – Lingering song<br>2	Bard 2 <br>3 	Bard 3 – Weapon Proficiency: Exotic<br>4	Bard 4 - +1 Con<br>5 	Bard 5<br>6 	RDD 1 – Weapon Focus: Bastard Sword<br>7 	RDD 2<br>8 	RDD 3 - +1 Con<br>9 	Bard 6 – Curse song<br>10	RDD 4<br>11 	CoT 1<br>12 	CoT 2 – Blind fight, Improved Critical: Bastard Sword, +1 Dex<br>13 	CoT 3<br>14 	CoT 4 - Knockdown<br>15 	Bard 7 – Extend spell<br>16 	RDD 5 - +1 Dex<br>17 	RDD 6 <br>18 	RDD 7 - Toughness<br>19	RDD 8 <br>20	Bard 8 - +1 Str<br>21	RDD 9 – Armour skin<br>22	RDD 10<br>23 	CoT 5<br>24 	Cot 6 – Epic weapon focus: Bastard Sword, Improved Knockdown, +1 Str<br>25 	Bard 9<br>26 	Bard 10<br>27 	Bard 11 – Great Strength I<br>28 	Bard 12 - +1 Str<br>29 	CoT 7<br>30 	CoT 8 – Epic Will, Epic Prowess<br>31	Bard 13<br>32 	Bard 14 - +1 Str<br>33 	Bard 15 – Expertise<br>34 	Bard 16<br>35	Bard 17<br>36 	Bard 18 – Great Strength II, +1 Cha<br>37 	CoT 9<br>38 	CoT 10 – Improved expertise<br>39 	Bard 19 – Epic Toughness I<br>40	Bard 20 - +1 Cha<br><br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 	24<br>Dex 	16<br>Con 	18<br>Wis 	10<br>Int 	16<br>Cha 	18<br><br><br>Skills<br><br>1 	Discipline 2, Lore 4, Perform 4, Spellcraft 2, Tumble 4, UMD 4, Taunt 4<br>2	Lore 1, Perform 1, Tumble 1, UMD 1, Taunt 1<br>3 	Discipline 1, Lore 1, Perform 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1, UMD 1, Taunt 1<br>4	Lore 1, Perform 1, Tumble 1, UMD 1, Taunt 1<br>5 	Discipline 1, Lore 1, Perform 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1, UMD 1, Taunt 1<br>6 	save<br>7	save <br>8 	save<br>9 	Discipline 1, Perform 4, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 4, UMD 4, Taunt 4<br>10	save<br>11 	save<br>12 	save<br>13 	save<br>14 	save<br>15 	Discipline 1, Perform 6, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 6, UMD 6, Taunt 6<br>16 	save<br>17 	save<br>18 	save<br>19	save<br>20	Discipline 1, Perform 5, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 5, UMD 5, Taunt 5<br>21	save<br>22	save<br>23 	save<br>24 	save<br>25 	Discipline 3, Perform 5, Spellcraft 3, Tumble 5, UMD 5, Taunt 5<br>26 	Discipline 1, Perform 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1, UMD 1, Taunt 1<br>27 	Discipline 2, Perform 1, Spellcraft 2, Tumble 1, UMD 1, Taunt 1<br>28 	Discipline 1, Perform 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1, UMD 1, Taunt 1<br>29 	save<br>30 	save<br>31	Discipline 3, Perform 3, Spellcraft 3, Tumble 3, UMD 3, Taunt 3<br>32 	Discipline 1, Perform 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1, UMD 1, Taunt 1<br>33 	Discipline 2, Perform 1, Spellcraft 2, Tumble 1, UMD 1, Taunt 1<br>34 	Discipline 1, Perform 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1, UMD 1, Taunt 1<br>35	Discipline 2, Perform 1, Spellcraft 2, Tumble 1, UMD 1, Taunt 1<br>36 	Discipline 1, Perform 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1, UMD 1, Taunt 1<br>37 	save<br>38 	save<br>39 	Discipline 5, Perform 3, Spellcraft 3, Tumble 1, UMD 3, Taunt 3<br>40	Discipline 4, Perform 1, UMD 1, Taunt 1<br><br><br><br>HP - 452<br><br><br>AC – naked 27<br><br><br>AB – Unarmed: 35/30/25/20.

I’ve taken some of the advice in the other thread but could let go of the bastard sword. I also forgot to mention that I wanted to avoid the whole dev crit thing which so many bard/RDD builds seem to aim for.<br><br>As for him being a mainline tank with few hitpoints and AC and the like, spells and buffs can help to some extent along with equipment, but for the main part I will be playing on a server and in a party – I’ll be more support/secondary tank type figure – and with the high tumble and a decent haste im sure I can outrun at least some of the party if things go wrong <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br><br>Cheers for any and all replies and advice.<br><br><i>Fixed typo in the leveling guide - Kail Pendragon</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 04/18/06 18:54</span></i></p>

A couple of suggestions:<br>At level 39, drop Epic Toughness and take Lasting Inspiration - makes your bard song last for 105 rounds. That's long enough so you can use Bard Song after rest, and again whenever it runs out, and only have to use Curse Song when you see enemies (instead of needing to do both at the start of the battle).<br><br>I would definitely get EWF before taking Armor Skin.<br><br>I would probably drop Epic Will and IE for 2 more Great Str. You have spells to protect you from mind effects, and as a str-based char you will benefit more from higher AB and more damage than from IE. If you want to keep IE, I would drop the exotic weaps and use one of the weapons discussed before, and take Expertise earlier to free up another epic feat.<br><br>You don't have Power Attack or Cleave, those would be nice to add in.<br><br>TM

Nope, but bastard sword is medium size. A halfling uses it two handed.

Medium according to the original post. That means AC5.<br><br>His AC 27 naked:<br>10 base<br>+1 size<br>+2 Dex<br>+8 tumble<br>+4 RDD<br>+2 Armor skin.<br><br>Add +5 for medium armor. You should try to include still spell, but you describe why not in the original post. But to those that wonder: still spell can, in some cases, be a life-saver.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Yeah - any armour up to medium.<br><br>At the moment I am running around in monks robes for the haste (still only low level) but its going well. theres some pretty good robes and light armours on the server i play on though so pretty much anything up to medium that will add to my AC and give me some extra abilities I feel may be useful.
