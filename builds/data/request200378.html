That gives you +2 AC and doesn't affect your DC of spells much as you get 4 more INT total which balances that out.

this build was designed for rplaying as a drow which is why i took elf and 10 cha and wis craft wand will be useful for freeing up spell slots but dropping quicken i might do i was just taking that so i dont need to worry about being countered so if not taking that, an extra 1 pre epic and 3 epic feats spare any suggestions as for the pre epic feat??

Grab silent spell, there are a lot of spells you may want to cast a level higher that can be silenced but not extended.  Also, it's very embarrassing if your wizard gets killed because he got silenced and doesn't have a single spell he can use to remedy the situation (e.g. a silent gust of wind, dispel or greater sanctuary is always nice to have).  <br><br>Also, after necromancy, evocation isn't a bad school to focus in.  It's probably a better focus for a cleric, since most of their evocations have saves against being stunned or blinded, but the more enemies who fail their saves against your evocations the better.  Illusion might be a good school to focus in as well.  Wierd is no longer considered death magic, if I read the 1.66 patch notes correctly, so a high DC wierd can be a good mass killer.  A good DC on phantasmal killer might be good as well.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

I also like to have my wizard specialize in Illusion.  I don't mean spell focuses, I mean specializing in that school at character creation.  Specializing in a school gives you an extra casting per day per spell level.  Why Illusion?  Well, all that really matters is the school that's in opposition to the school you choose, since you'll lose access to those spells.  Specializing in Illusion makes you lose enchantment, which is honestly a very easy school to lose.  There is little need for those spells.  Specializing in necromancy, for example, would knock out divination, which is a bad idea (you lose spells like True Seeing and Premontion).  In my opinion, Illusion is the best school to specialize in.<br><br>Steve
