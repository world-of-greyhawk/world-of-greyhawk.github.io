The 9th lvl Arcane spellcasting means you will be able to cast Mord's on an enemy spellcaster in order to get rid of True Seeing.  <br><br>Once True Seeing is gone, you can then proceed to Shadowdance them (use HiPS).  Since you have Dev. Crit., and you're dual-wielding weapons with a 12-20 threat range, you're actually quite dangerous in melee.  Even though your AB is a bit low, you've got True Strike, and if you can catch your opponent flat-footed using HiPS, they lose all Dex and Dodge AC.  <br><br>Although your AC is a bit low as well, Epic Mage Armor helps to make up for it, and even if your enemies do manage to hit you, you've got 50/+20 DR from Epic Warding, as well as reciprocal damage shields.  <br><br>If melee proves too slow for you, you always have the ability to start spamming Empowered IGMS.  Although I considered adding Maximize Spell to the build, I realized that a maxed IGMS takes a 9th lvl spell slot, which means fewer Mord's to play with.  Thus, I took Empower Spell instead.
