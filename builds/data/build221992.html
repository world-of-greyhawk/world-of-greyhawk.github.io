I was also shocked that there wasn't a single build out there with this class combination (unless I made a mistake using the search tool, which isn't unlikely).  Anyway, obviously it has a pretty diverse arsenal of tools to deal with enemies.  From what I've seen, the main weakness of monks has always been too little damage for each attack.  <br><br>The combination of improved knockdown-generated sneaks and his solid strength score assure that this guy will rarely have trouble harming his enemies, and his high AB will assure that he hits consistently (even when using KD).  Crit-immune enemies are still going to be a little tougher to take down, of course, but some darkfire/flame weapon scrolls and/or bull's strength potions will help in that regard.<br><br>If darkness and ultravision scrolls are available to you, you can generate sneaks that way as well.  <br><br>The main weaknesses of this build are it's lowish AC and saves.  Fortunately, AC isn't too difficult to raise since both Dex and Wis items will boost it and his uncanny dodge assures he won't lose his AC bonuses.  Saves are the biggest problem, particularly Will and Fortitude.  I am open to suggestions on how to improve these (slippery mind instead of crippling strike comes to mind).<br><br>Anyway, I haven't played this yet nor has he been built in the actual game, but the CBC has always been pretty reliable in terms of accuracy and I checked him over pretty carefully before posting.  However, if you see any glaring errors, please don't hesitate to let me know.<br>_________________<br>Favorite PW's: Hall of the Worlds, Higher Ground, World of Iniquity.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 12/02/05 23:32</span></i></p>

I would like to see a two-hander but it would have to be a quarterstaff and how much fun is that?  You'd lose two attacks per round for the same base damage and only gain back half of your strength bonus per hit.  You would look pretty cool with your whirlwind attack, though.  But no keen possibility for your weapon, a further disadvantage.  If you want to give up the attacks inherent in the kama, go rapier for the improved critical range.  <br><br>The AB is impressive, particularly for a non-RDD (so disfavored in the current climate) with as much flexibility as this build has.  <br><br>27 base + 11 str + 1 SWF + 3 ESWF + 1 WF + 2 EWF + 1 EP = 46<br><br>It is somewhat feat starved but the monk and rogue abilities provide many useful feats, particularly IKD, which you correctly note is very useful for a sneaker.<br><br>All in all, a very nice build and original, to boot. <br><br>Huzzah.

I am a fan of the katana, which is what would make this guy a REAL kensai.  It's a tough choice, but with so few feats I'm at a loss as to how I could justify squeezing out one of the few feats I have that are "optional" to the build to get Exotic WP (not to mention losing 2 atks/rnd by doing so).<br><br>Hopefully NWN2 will let our beloved monks at least use a staff.  It's borderline blasphemy that they don't get their improved attack routine with them already.  Hopefully, they will adhere to 3.5E rules and there won't be nearly as much cheese with monks (it requires more monk levels to get the superior attack sequence in 3.5).<br><br>Anyway, thanks for your commments!<br>_________________<br>Favorite PW's: Hall of the Worlds, Higher Ground, World of Iniquity.
