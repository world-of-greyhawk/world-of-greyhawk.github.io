I have struggled with this question a lot, trying to find which is more powerful. I typically use a Greatsword for a two handed weapon and I katanas for both of the dual weapons. Can anyone explain to me the best way to find out which would cause more damage?

Another advantage with two weapons is the ability to equipe weapons with different Elemental Damage properties.  One Cold and one Acid dagger for instance.  It may not seem like a big advantage, but when you face a foe with Energy Immunities, it may make a big difference to have more flexibility.<br><br>You are most likely going to pre-buff your weapons before combat.  Avoiding a weapon swap during your travels is always nice.

Two small weapons. You can switch to shields when you need AC. If you have much damage that doesn't come from STR like Bane of Enemies or sneak attacks, dual is better than 2-hander. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Think of the feats! Gah!<br><br>Well, I think for most purposes, Duel-Wielding is better. But thats why it costs you three feats. If you can spare the feats, either with Fighter or CoT levels, or Ranger, then go for it. But something like a Bard/RDD/Weapon Master or a Paladin/CoT who needs his feats to Smite, will be better off with a Shield and a Weapon, or a Two Handed weapon due to them being massive damage dealers. Plus, they are feat starved.<br><br>Depends on the build and what it is you are sacrificing in order to be able to use two weapons.

I still think we should go through this with the calculator as Finn suggested to make things more clear. <br><br>I'll give a couple of examples:<br> <br><i>Happy Joe</i> is a lvl 40 fighter with Str 30. He has WF and EWF in Greatsword, Katana and Two bladed sword as well as Epic Prowess. He also has TWF,ITW;Ambidexterity and EWS in all three weapon types. (These weapons all have the same crit threat range and multiplier, so I won't calculate that in here)<br><br>His AB with mundane weapons will be:<br>Greatsword: 44/39/34/29, with average 37,5<br>2 Katanas: 40/35/30/25/40/35, with average 34,16<br>Two bladed sword: 42/37/32/27/42/37, with average 36,16<br>Damage with mundane weapons (hit on every attack):<br>Greatsword: 2d6+15+6=23-33 per hit. 92-132 per round.<br>2 Katanas: 1d10+10+6=17-26 per hit main hand. 1d10+5+6=12-21 offhand. 92-146 per round.<br>Two bladed sword: 1d8+10+6=17-24 per hit main hand. 1d8+5+6=12-19 offhand. 92-134 per round.<br><br><i>Raging John</i> is a lvl 40 Barbarian with Str 30. He has the appropriate WF, EWF, EP and all 3 TWF related feats.<br><br>When he rages his Str is 36 adding +3 to his AB that otherwise is just like Happy Joe's. <br>Damage (raging) will be:<br>Greatsword: 2d6+19=21-31 per hit. 84-124 per round<br>2 Katanas: 1d10+11=12-21 per hit main hand. 1d10+5=6-15 per hit offhand. 60-114 per round.<br>Two bladed sword:1d8+11=12-19 per hit main hand. 1d8+5=6-13 per hit offhand. 60-102 per round.<br><br>When the AC is extremely low so every hit lands and when AC is so high that you only hit on a 20, you can compare the damage like I have done above. <br>In the mid range between these extremes, the Greatsword will hit more consistantly because of a better max AB and average AB.<br><br>Dualwielding will become better whenever damage is added to each hit like with weapon specialization (Happy Joe above)and with added weapon enhancements (like Thaxll'ssyllia suggested).<br><br>A two hander will make more damage on each hit, and will be the best weapon against a high DR.<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan

First, you can't ignore crits. More attacks wit dual-wield. And the 4 best attacks are better than the 4 best on greatsword. Only the best one is lower. Now start counting BoE or Sneaks and dual/wielding quickly outshines it, even vs DR, except perhaps vs really high DR.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>
