Among the followers of Chauntea, the most widespread church in all of Faerûn, there exists a holy order of knights that seeks to protect the fields from every sort of blight.  Paladins of the Order of the Field Guardians are charged with seeking out those who would wish ruin on the crops of her followers.<br><br>This is an attempt to make a "turning" machine with excellent offensive and defensive powers, able to use a massive charisma bonus and high cleric levels to turn (or destroy instantly):<br><br>Undead<br>Outsiders<br>Elementals<br>Vermin<br><br>Playable: 1-40 PvM<br>Name: Field Guardian<br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Lawful Good<br><br>Starting Stats<br><br>STR: 14<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 10<br>INT: 12<br>WIS: 15<br>CHA: 16<br><br>Level/feat/ability progression<br><br>1 cleric - Toughness, Extra Turning, Plant Domain, Earth Domain<br>2 cleric <br>3 cleric - Power Attack<br>4 cleric - <i>+1 Wisdom</i><br>5 cleric <br>6 cleric - Divine Might<br>7 cleric <br>8 cleric - <i>+1 Wisdom</i><br>9 cleric - Extend Spell<br>10 cleric <br>11 cleric <br>12 cleric - Divine Shield, <i>+1 Wisdom</i><br>13 cleric <br>14 cleric <br>15 cleric - Combat Casting<br>16 cleric - <i>+1 Wisdom</i><br>17 cleric <br>18 paladin - Zen Archery<br>19 cleric <br>20 cleric - <i>+1 Charisma</i><br>21 cleric - Great Charisma I<br>22 cleric <br>23 cleric<br>24 cleric - Great Charisma II, Improved Combat Casting, <i>+1 Charisma</i> <br>25 cleric <br>26 cleric <br>27 cleric - Great Charisma III, Great Wisdom I<br>28 cleric - <i>+1 Charisma</i> <br>29 cleric <br>30 cleric - Great Charisma IV, Great Wisdom II<br>31 cleric <br>32 cleric - <i>+1 Charisma</i><br>33 cleric - Great Charisma V, Great Wisdom III<br>34 cleric <br>35 cleric <br>36 cleric - Great Wisdom IV, Great Wisdom V, <i>+1 Wisdom</i> <br>37 cleric <br>38 cleric <br>39 cleric - Planar Turning, Great Charisma VI<br>40 monk - <i>+1 Wisdom</i><br><br>Ending Stats<br><br>STR: 14<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 10<br>INT: 12<br>WIS: 26<br>CHA: 26<br><br>Skills: Ranks (unbuffed modified):<br>Concentration: 43 (43)<br>Discipline: 43 (45) <br>Heal: 9 (17)<br>Spellcraft: 39 (40)<br>Tumble: 40 (39)<br><br>HP: 301 (no cheat) Max: 362<br><br>Saves: Fort 31, Reflex 23 (evasion applies), Will 37, +8 vs Spells<br><br>Naked AC: 25<br>Buffed AC (no magic items): self buff to 57 minimum (generally ~58), but as Dexterity, Wisdom, and CHA all add to AC, it can get much higher with OC level items.  With a haste item, monk boots, and a +4 CHA item, easily runs around with +20 Dodge AC most of the time, +5 deflection (shield of faith), +5 natural (barkskin), +5 Magical (Magic Vestment). ~AC 55 buffed in mundane robes.  More with Dex and Wis items.<br><br>Attack Bonus (Kama): +27/+24/+21/+18/+15<br>Attack Bonus buffed with full line of cleric buffs and flurry of blows:<br>+47/+44/+41/+38/+35/+47/+47 (and another +47 with a haste item).<br><br>Damage output per kama hit with no magic items:  1d6 + 4 STR (Divine Power) + 5 (Greater Magic Weapon) + 9 (Divine Might) + 7 magical (+5 Divine Favor, +2 Battletide) + 1d6+10 fire (Darkfire).  Minimum damage: 37 per hit, of which 17 cannot be prevented by most targets (divine and magic damage).  It's even more fun when you add the divine and magic damage to ranged damage with Zen Archery and a magic bow (which is what the Field Guardian uses from levels 18 on; before that, a morningstar).<br><br>Thus far we have a pretty balanced character offensively and defensively.  Not superb at either, but far above average for a support character and still better than most at both.  Tack on the full power of cleric healing, and a spell resistance of 50 (that can be doled out to companions), and you have a versatile healer than can help out anywhere on the battlefield.  More than enough cleric levels to take a few Harm spells with you.<br><br>So, why on earth would I take Plant and Earth domains, and what's up with the planar turning?  Hehe, well, those are two of Chauntea's domains, and they both add to turning ability, where this build can shine.  This cleric will turn as a Level 42 cleric half the time, due to her high CHA.  She'll also be able to turn up to a 64 HD of undead, vermin, outsiders, or elementals (19 times per day).  Outsiders add their full spell resistance to their Hit Dice for turn attempts.  Planar turning cuts this in half (and if your Sorcerer friend happens to hit it with a Mord's Disjunction, that's effectively +5 to your turn check).<br><br>Plant domain is useful throughout the lower levels, and even into the higher levels, as it allows the cleric to maintain +3 to +5 Natural Armor bonus while wearing a Periapt of Wisdom.  There are a lot of vermin on the way up, and even some epic vermin HotU.  Earth Domain is less important, and infact Destruction Domain is better (do approximately 100 unavoidable damage a pop to Constructs), but Earth is a Chauntea domain and I'm working on an Umberlant version (with Blackguard instead) that will use Water and Destruction to the same effect.<br>_________________<br>Vulcano's <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&amp;id=6522" target="_blank">Bard Studio</a> (in beta, 1.67).  *Updated*  Compose, play, and save your own bard music dynamically in game!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Vulcano on 04/11/06 02:30</span></i></p>

I don't think there's really need for Combat Casting and Improved Combat Casting, maybe Empower Spell instead of Combat Casting and Armor Skin instead of Improved Combat Casting.<br><br>Great Turner.

It could use empower spell, as empowered Blade Barriers make for nice level 8 slots. Could also take focus and greater focus in evocation to add to Imposion DC (and most other offensive spell DCs).<br>_________________<br>Vulcano's <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&amp;id=6522" target="_blank">Bard Studio</a> (in beta, 1.67).  *Updated*  Compose, play, and save your own bard music dynamically in game!

You can use defensive casting mode and save two feats also.
