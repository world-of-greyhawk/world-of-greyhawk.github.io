This is actually pretty funny!<br><br>One question though, would Rage be the best way to simulate a Saiyan's "super-ness"?  It seems to me that they hit an entirely different level of being when going "super".  Perhaps some cleric or something instead.  Can anyone else think of something?

On the majority of not-so-serious servers Divine Power can be stacked to give you 3 additional attacks instead of 1 and DF is Divine Favor which gives +5 AB +5 Magical DMG (if you have &gt;=15 levels in the casting class) so you can hit majorly hard.. Personally.. I think a Monk 21 Cleric 17 Wizard 2 (1 early in 20s to make it easier to level with true strike, 1 later on to max spellcraft saves) would be the sort of thing a SSJ is, short but not to short bursts of awesomeness.<br><br>-DaMouse
