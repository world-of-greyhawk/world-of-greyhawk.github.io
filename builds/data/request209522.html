Can you clarify what you mean by 'base damage no crits'? I'm confused on this point, as it seems you're looking for a character that doesn't rely on crits for damage, but that's pretty much what the WM is designed for. So, it wouldn't make much sense to go for that prestige class in the build if you don't want to lean on crit damage.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

what problems are you having?  there are probably dozens of builds that one could make with that combination of characters.  <br>If you are looking for damage then I would concentrate on strength.  Since you are using kamas, and i think that you can use flurry of blows in armor (need to check on that), you could neglect your wis and dex in favour of str and con.  if this is not the case, then concentrate on str and dex.  high base damage just isn't going to happen without spells, high strength or sneak attack for a small weapon.  perhaps dropping WM for rogue might work out better?  is that an option?  usually dual wielders go for the numerous hits with smaller damage.<br>for these classes i might suggest something like the following:<br><br>str 16<br>dex 14<br>con 14<br>wis 10<br>int 14<br>cha 8<br><br>put all bonus points into strength, use the epic feats for great dexterity i-vi (maybe to vii if you can get monk boots +5), and use some fighter feats to get epic weapon focus and epic weapon specialization.  get armor skin.  using monk robes and boots, wis amulets and str belts, damage and AC should be acceptable.  i would recommend at least 6 monk levels, to get IKD, +1 armor bonus and for tumble point dumps.  10 monk levels would net you another +1 to AC and improved evasion.  with weapon master and monk levels coupled with a decent dex score, your reflex saves should be great.  still mind helps with will saves.  fort should be ok.  putting some points into listen to negate the loss of AC from hidden ppl is a good idea.<br>for a higher AB, try for a mix like 22 WM, 6 Monk, 12 Fighter, or for more resistant to magic and the like, try 13 WM, 12 Fighter, 15 Monk, or even 7 WM, 8 fighter, 25 monk.  there are obviously a number of variation on this, but those just sprung to mind.  give us some more details on what you need and maybe we can help you out better.<br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Perception is strong and sight weak.
