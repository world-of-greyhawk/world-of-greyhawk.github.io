Well done Grim, I especially like the dwarf version. I'm no big fan of pure builds because of their inherent limitations but your ranger is an example of how careful choices can give good results out of a pure build.<br><br>I'll be waiting for the multiclass ranger though, I'm sure it rocks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

I was just going to make a similar build, but you beat me to it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br><br>I like to use the double sword with this kind of build, but I have nothing against your choice of kukris.

The point with kukri's is good crit range, tiny so lowest penalty and still keeping your weapon feats if you need the shield. This ranger is a strength build that doesn't necessarily have lower AC than the Plate wearers even when dual-wielding. With some Gear and C's grace you can reach the magic 26 DEX so tou can wear padded armour, which is 1 base +8 from DEX, and that gives you the same as Plate. Not flat-footed mind you. You don't have UMD, so no monk equipment. Magical padded is way to go.<br>Even the Dwarven version can reach DEX 26, just takes more effort. Another thing I'd like to mention, you really shouldn't go DEX based with pure Rangers. No uncanny, and real hard time pre-epic.
