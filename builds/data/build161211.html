Trip wires have been pulled, the traps are triggered!<br><br>The elfen gaurd is on the move; they know there has been a disterbance in the wood and they mean to find it.  Moving under spells of speed and inviso they travel fast and hear even the bugs as they crawl under the forest floor.  Soon they find the invader's, Orcs from moria bent on distruction.  The first volloy of arrows is a surprise but the Orcs charge forward and engage the wimpy elfs in front of them.  But that is not enough, arrow continue to pour out of the woods at all angles, and the blades of the elfs in front of the Orcs are everywhere and impossable to breach.  Its over quickly, all the Orcs are dead and not one elf was harmed!  The elf's look to Moria and curse the Dwarf's for awaking that evil below it.....<br><br>Elf archer CG<br>Rogue 13 Wizard 8 A.Archer 19<br><br>Melee: Robes, Large Shield and Rapier<br>Archery: Long Bow and Robes<br><br>Str 14<br>Dex 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 +12 items = 48<br>Con 8<br>Wis 8<br>Int 14<br>Cha 8<br><br>All Stat bumps in Dex plus 6 greater dex feats<br><br>Level progression<br><br>L1  R  Point Blank Shot<br>L2  M<br>L3  R  Weapon Finesse<br>L4  R<br>L5  R<br>L6  R  Weapon Focus Long Bow<br>L7  R<br>L8  M<br>L9  R  Rapid Shot<br>L10 AA<br>L11 AA<br>L12 AA Imp.

This char can buff up with Stat bumps to str, con and dex.  Throw up Improved Inviso, Haste and Mage armor and head into battle.  It things look bad and the go melee you can drop into Parry mode or put up Death Armor and Elemtal Shield.  Your weakness is disarm and KD as you have no Disipline skill so I would suggest using Parry mode and let your parry do the killing while you keep the attack busy.  Cant get your sneaks in?  Cast Darkness and start firing away or pull the Rapier out and attack.<br><br>Boss Tank:  Many times I've been in party and the high DR, low AC two handed weapon guys that smash thier way past the the guards but die fast when facing that single Boss.  But now you can Tank, with epic dodge, 50% Concel from Imp Inv and parry mode active you will be one hard to hit SOB.  Let those smelly dwarfen defenders flank and kill that Boss NPC while you to the trench work of keeping him busy!<br><br>Very nice AB, good damage, buffs, Good AC - and tankable with Parry!  The best all around archer that I could come up with.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/25/08 02:34</span></i></p>

How well does parry actually work? I've always heard it was sorta a pointless ability but then again I've never tried bumping up the stats in it and testing it out. I also assume you have to have a melee weapon equiped in order for the ability to work.

Grrr I dont see a way to edit my post, well here is a different break down on AB.  It was pointed out on a different post not to use the +12 due to item bumps or buffs on your stats.  Or to seperate them out better.<br><br>Plain Long Bow and within 30'<br>54/49/44/39<br><br>Long Bow +5 and within 30' and using rapid shot<br>57/52/47/42/37<br><br>L. Bow +5, in 30', Hastened, Rapid Shot, +12 to Dex<br>63/58/53/47/42/42 (?)<br>not sure how the haste works on the +1 to attack<br><br>Plain Long Bow + 9 sec of True Strike and +12 Dex<br>79/74/69/64<br><br>Parry, man thats a long subjuect.  I suggest using a seach on the NWN forums for more detail.  But here is the quick and dirty as I understand it.<br>1) Max you can parry in one round is 3 hits<br>2) To Parry you need to beat the attackers adjusted ab vs your Parry DC + 1D20<br>3) If you your parry is X (6?) above the adjusted attack roll you get to couter attack (respite).  However some feel this attack is counted as one of your 3 parry attemts per round.<br>4) Parry is near useless in one on one combat (I feel), but best used in party when one guy is to keep a NPC busy to let the party members flank it. Or when, in this build, when someone is trying to KD or Disarm you.  Your crap Dis skill means a hit = success but if you can parry the blows and keep this attacker busy until your party comes to help you will have succeced.
