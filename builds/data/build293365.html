He had been watching them for weeks.  Tracking their movements and assessing the threat to his tribe.  The tribe was counting on him to provide warnings and information.  For years the orcs had free reign but recently the humans had been encroaching on their territory and the tribe was planning on stopping it.  They were outnumbered but with his information the tribe stood a chance.  Then up ahead he spotted a small force of humans.  Moving forward he drew his axes, this group he could take care of himself….<br><br>Similar Builds:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "219313", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Forest's Fury</a><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "249743", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Bloodred Vengeance</a><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "217221", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Elven Battlechaser</a><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "221069", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Wild Woodsman</a><br><br>Ranger(23), Barbarian(17), Half-Orc<br><br>Race: Half-Orc<br>Alignment: non-Lawful<br>Playable: 1-40 PvM and PvP<br><br>STR: 18 (26)<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 16 (22)<br>WIS: 12<br>INT: 6<br>CHA: 6<br><br>Half-Orc: (Darkvision)<br>01: Ranger(1): Luck of Heroes, FE 1, {Dual Wield}<br>02: Barbarian(1)<br>03: Ranger(2): Power Attack<br>04: Barbarian(2): CON+1, {Uncanny Dodge I}, (CON=17)<br>05: Ranger(3)<br>06: Ranger(4): Cleave<br>07: Ranger(5): FE 2<br>08: Ranger(6): STR+1, (STR=19)<br>09: Ranger(7): Great Cleave<br>10: Ranger(8)<br>11: Ranger(9): {Improved Two-Weapon Fighting}<br>12: Ranger(10): STR+1, Toughness, FE 3, (STR=20)<br>13: Barbarian(3)<br>14: Barbarian(4)<br>15: Ranger(11): Weapon Focus: Greataxe<br>16: Ranger(12): CON+1, (CON=18)<br>17: Barbarian(5)<br>18: Barbarian(6): Weapon Focus: Battleaxe<br>19: Ranger(13)<br>20: Ranger(14): CON+1, (CON=19)<br>21: Barbarian(7): Great Strength I, (STR=21)<br>22: Barbarian(8)<br>23: Ranger(15): FE 4<br>24: Ranger(16): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=23)<br>25: Barbarian(9)<br>26: Barbarian(10)<br>27: Ranger(17): Great Strength III, (STR=24)<br>28: Ranger(18): STR+1, (STR=25)<br>29: Barbarian(11)<br>30: Barbarian(12): Great Constitution I, (CON=20)<br>31: Ranger(19)<br>32: Ranger(20): CON+1, FE 5, (CON=21)<br>33: Ranger(21): Bane of Enemies<br>34: Ranger(22)<br>35: Ranger(23): Epic Prowess<br>36: Barbarian(13): CON+1, Epic Toughness I, (CON=22)<br>37: Barbarian(14)<br>38: Barbarian(15)<br>39: Barbarian(16): Thundering Rage<br>40: Barbarian(17): STR+1, (STR=26)<br><br><br>Hitpoints: 734<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 31/18/19<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Traps: +4<br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 33 (ranged)<br>AB Dual Wield: Mundane Battle Axe/Hand Axe<br>	38/33/28/23 at 1d8 +8 and 38/33 at 1d6 +4<br>	Against FE 40/35/30/25 at 1d8 +8 +6 +2d6 and 40/35 at 1d6 +4 +6 +2d6<br>	Plus Rage 43/38/33/28 at 1d8 +11 +6 +2d6 and 43/38 at 1d6 +5 +6 +2d6<br>	Plus Thunderous Rage add 2d6 per critical<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 16/24<br>Spell Casting: Ranger(2)<br>Alignment Changes: 0<br><br>Skillpoints: 86<br>Discipline 33(41), Lore 13(11), Tumble 20(22)<br><br>01: Discipline(4), Tumble(2), <br>02: Discipline(1), Save(1), <br>03: Lore(1), Tumble(1), <br>04: Discipline(1), Save(1), <br>05: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), <br>06: Discipline(1), Save(1), <br>07: Lore(1), Tumble(1), <br>08: Discipline(1), Save(1), <br>09: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), <br>10: Discipline(1), Save(1), <br>11: Lore(1), Tumble(1), <br>12: Discipline(1), Save(1), <br>13: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), <br>14: Discipline(1), Save(1), <br>15: Lore(1), Tumble(1), <br>16: Discipline(1), Save(1), <br>17: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), <br>18: Discipline(1), Save(1), <br>19: Lore(1), Tumble(1), <br>20: Discipline(1), Save(1), <br>21: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), <br>22: Discipline(1), Save(1), <br>23: Lore(1), Tumble(1), <br>24: Discipline(1), Save(1), <br>25: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), <br>26: Discipline(1), Save(1), <br>27: Lore(1), Tumble(1), <br>28: Discipline(1), Save(1), <br>29: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), <br>30: Discipline(1), Save(1), <br>31: Lore(1), Tumble(1), <br>32: Discipline(1), Save(1), <br>33: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), <br>34: Discipline(1), Save(1), <br>35: Lore(1), Tumble(1), <br>36: Discipline(1), Save(1), <br>37: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), <br>38: Lore(2), <br>39: Discipline(1), Lore(1), <br>40: Discipline(1), Lore(1), <br><br>Advantages: Good Hit Points, Not bad AB, nice damage, a little DR, a few Ranger spells to help, and Animal Companion as support staff.<br>Disadvantages: Not great AC and few skill points.<br><br>Another option would be to drop CON and add to INT for more skill points at a loss of Hit Points.<br><br><br><i>Title fix - Kail Pendragon</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 03/08/08 11:43</span></i></p>

I'd drop the Ranger spell and hence WIS to 8, go for 10 INT and get Terrifying rage instead of Thundering Rage.<br><br>Discipline should be maxed, cut on Lore. <br><br>Epic Toughness and no EWF? CON 22 and no EDR? Drop Epic Toughness and get EWF (+2 AB). Or drop 2 Great STR for EWF and AS and change Epic Toughness for EDR I, since you've got the CON score for it.<br><br>I'd get KD/IKD instead of the second WF and Great Cleave.

You do need 13 INT for IKD.<br><br>Now, taking a quick look at your build, you should change several feats:<br><br>Drop Luck of Heroes for Blind-Fight, it's important unless no one can have Concealment on your server.<br><br>Drop Toughness for Knockdown, your HP is high already, KD is better.<br><br>Take Epic Damage Reduction! it's just wrong not to take it when you meet the pre-requisites already, it's a powerful feat.<br><br>I don't know why you want only pre-epic focus on 2 different weapons, but it's best to drop one and take Epic Weapon Focus only on one (you might as well regain Toughness).<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

A couple of thoughts:<br><br>Ranger needs WIS of 11 so I can't drop this any further.<br><br>My weapn focuses were for two weapon fighting. On the server I made this for I can play a Minotaur with Great Axe in one hand and Battle Axe in the other.<br><br>Knockdown, EDR, and blind fight do sound like good ideas.<br><br>Any other thoughts on how to get my AB up higher.  I have dropped two great strength for Epic Weap Focus and Armor Skin (I am used to NWN2 where AS is not as useful).
