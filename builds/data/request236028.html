Elder Scrolls 4? I just recently got it, and I think the whole "Custom Class" thing is awesome! I was wondering if anyone has played it and could post a character build for me... my current character is<br><br>race: Breton<br>class: (custom) Arch-Mage<br>sign: The Mage<br>major skills: <br>Heavy Armor<br>Marksman<br>Blade<br>Acrobatics<br>block<br>persuasion<br>lockpicking<br><br>as you can see I got all the opposite skills that a mage should have... thats so I have lots and lots of time to level up my others skills <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> . He is level 2 and has 100 in everything except for his major skills.<br><br>anyways thanks<br><br>P.S. SORRY FOR COMPLETE OFF-TOPICness<br>_________________<br>They were all dead. The final gunshot was an exclamation mark to everything that had led up to this point. I released my finger from the trigger. And then it was all over. The storm seemed to lose its frenzy. The ragged clouds gave way to the stars above.

Haven't played the new one but it seems a lot like the old one, though I haven't got very far into it. The freedom is great imo, can either role play it hardcore or make a build that is perfect at everything though it would take a very long time.
