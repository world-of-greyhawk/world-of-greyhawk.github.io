This is probably the best archer build that I have tested. It was created by Syrath. If you want an archer with some lasting power, try this out:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "144016", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>I should learn how to embed links...<br><br>heh<br><br>Oh P.S.
