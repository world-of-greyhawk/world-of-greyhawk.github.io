I beleive that you can change into a dragon with any of the two, but which one would be better?

Well, unless you are talking about a PRC build, which you should probably specify, then a cleric can't become a shifter unless you pick up 5 druid levels as well.  So, you should probably clarify whether you meant a cleric/druid/shifter build or you wanted builds using the PRC.<br><br>Steve

Even with the PRC cleric does not give access to the PnP Shifter class so cleric/shifter is not going to be an option unless you take a race like Rakshasa or Pixie or class like Werewolf that gives access to the PnP shifter. Without the PRC druid/shifter is the best option although druid/cleric could get the druid animal/elemental and dragon shapes.<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

Wow, I had know Idea this would turn into a touchy issue.I have another question though. I got tenth level spells for my wizard, and I got a spell that would allow me to change forms. There was dragon, balor, and some other stuff. But I was never able to change into the dragon. Did my alignment have anything to do with that?

Avado, I'm totally at a loss as to why you feel the need to be obnoxious in so many of your posts.  As a prior poster pointed out, your could have made your point far more effectively if you weren't intentionally rude about it.  And anyway, it's not like giving the poster PRC information after having said it was based on the PRC's PnP Shifter and not the Bioware shifter is some horrific sin that needs to be punished or something.  It's just giving them another option that they might be interested in, even if you aren't.  Your attitude toward your fellow guild members is offensive, completely uncalled for, and utterly ridiculous.  I highly doubt you would expect/want us to treat your suggestions in such a manner if we disagreed with them.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 07/18/05 06:15</span></i></p>

Avado, all suggestions are welcome in here. Even the PrC. The one of the rule(s) states that if you are planning to post your own build... it needs to be original NWN for the ECB form... and those with PrC in it... anything that is from PrC... would need to be posted in the PrC ECB forum.<br><br>And this is build request forum... anything goes in here. <br><br>Also, the PrC is not a game... it is an addition to the existing game to improve options that you have when building a build. If you want to have werewolf class... look into the PrC, they have them, I am sure they are adding ninja class as well.<br><br>And, please, tone down the posts, meaning unnecessary caps, and so forth. It is forum to improve the build, or offer insights about what builds that may suit the need to build the particular build that the posters want. If he wants the cleric shifter, then anyone can suggest a PrC build and then post it in the apporiate PrC forum. And same with Cleric/druid... if there are builds that suits his needs.. then post the links to it.<br><br>Just don't want to have another flame war or any of that sort in here again like before...

I didn't know that you had to have wildshape before you could be a shifter. I guess it will just be a cleric/druid build. Either way, I hope I can change into a bloody dragon

Just need 30 wisdom and a decent amount of druid levels, and must be in epic levels.  Something like 15-16 levels, not sure exactly.

Just a note. All you need to be a dragon is druid and 30 wisdom.  The shifter/druid dragon only has a slightly better breath weapon.  The best dragon builds have no shifter at all.  This is NON-PRC.
