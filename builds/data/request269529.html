I'll try to be as specific with exactly what I want as I can be.  Hopefully you guys can help me.  I've gone through a few characters, with no real luck.  <br><br>My PW (Blade of Destiny) is still in Beta, I've been with them for a year now.  We're just getting into NwN so things aren't exactly set in stone as far as HIPS and Dev Crit are concerned.  For now they're allowed, but it may change eventually.  AoE spells affecting party members?  That's still whatever the DEFAULT setting is, we haven't changed it.  Again, that could change.<br><br>A little about our PW:<br>-Our story revolves a lot around the undead<br>-We have a lot of Rangers for some reason.. so that's out.<br>-There's 1 powerful Cleric, and 1 powerful Wizard so far, I don't know about the more Melee based classes, but these two WILL probably be the power for a while.<br>-It's really Low-Magic as far as items.  +1 is going to be RARE!<br>-I may be eligable for an advanced race char (Probably a vamp or fiend) so let's try to keep the race of the build human, and able to swap over if I do get one <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Now, what I would like...<br>-I DO want to be viable in both PvM and PvP<br>-I won't be fighting players ALL that much, but our monsters hit hard, and have a lot of AB.<br>-My main goals are just to be a useful member of the party when it comes to fighting, and I want to be confident I won't get OWNED when tempers flair.<br><br>I seem to die a LOT.  I don't know if it comes from poor character building (What's the opposite of optimization?) or if I just suck at this game, but I end up in purgatory a good bit.  Mostly at low levels, it may be the monsters are just too tough for me.  <br><br>I don't exactly like pure casters in NwN, I want to keep my tactics less predictable and less... what's the word I'm looking for?  Less "Using all 36 damn hotkeys".  I know this may seem like a tough order, and it is, but I'll make exceptions for a lot of this, it's just a rough outline.<br><br>I'm kind of fond of defensive builds, I heard about a Bard/RDD that gets stupidly high AC, but I haven't found it.  The Undead Lord Powerbuild seemed a little hard to work with from level 1, but that kind of defensive power is what I'm looking for.  In other words, I just want to survive, I'll never be the POWER of the party, but when I die I want everyone else to be dead first.<br><br>So throw some ideas at me please, I'll really appreciate it.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-D

We already have a good cleric, and with our custom (homebrew) pantheon, I'm sure they'll have some special restrictions.  <br><br>But you're right... on a low-magic setting clerics are extremely powerful.

Two other powerful builds in low-magic are Ftr/Bard/RDD or Barbarian builds with Terrifying Rage. Both allow you to get significant bonuses to abilities.<br><br>TM

Won't most spellcasters be immune to Terrifying rage?  I've never used it, so I don't know much about it, but if you're immune to mind affecting abilities, that's counted too, right?

Simple, use a Dwarven Defender, they're natural tanks, you simply won't die... ever, with +1 weapons available only spellswords and Clerics will be able to net damage on you man, same goes for PvM.<br><br>The tanker is well recieved on any party btw.<br><br>Now then... what kind? so many to choose.<br><br>If you want playability I suggest a Fighter 8 / Champion of Torm 4 / Dwarven Defender 28, simply because such build can get EDR III much sooner than any other, which makes you unstoppable by any means, the trick is to leave both Fighter and CoT at odd levels pre-epic, to gain bonus feats instantly on epics. I don't have a level 40 build for it, but I do have <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "13568", "23072", "236843", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>this</a> one, very playable, or try the <a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">build searcher</a><br><br>Cleric / Dwarven Defender is much stronger for your environment, and my favorite btw, but I understand you don't want to make another Cleric.

You could try a Paladin 26, Bard 4, RDD 10 combination - decent AB certainly, AC would be ok with Divine Shield, Tumble, Armor Skin and RDD Bonus.<br><br>Didn't notice any alignment/ class restrictions in your post so this may be ok for you.

I like Ftr/Wiz/PM as a build, it seemed to be just what I was looking for... It just seemed kind of tough to play from level 1.<br><br>I don't know exactly how hard scrolls are going to be to find, obviously, but I don't see that as a huge problem.  Somehow I don't see myself making it to level 40 any time soon... but end game, how does that build stack up in PvP?

*Sigh, I wonder why is it my Dwarven Defender ideas get ignored so often <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cry.gif">  (probably my fault for trying every single time), it's an easy effective build on any low magic environment, you were asking for a defensive build after all <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif"> <br><br>Fighter / Wizard / Pale Master? yeah, it's quite good on PvP as well, though I wonder if you're thinking on it as a melee or a caster... you can take lots of PM and Fighter with little Wizard and even get Epic Warding and still be a melee, high base AC and all, but your casting power will be low-ish, I believe that in a +1 environment your buffs from Wizard levels will be ultimately stronger, so taking more Wizard will net a stronger overall build, but going too much on it will kill your BAB.

I didn't mean it to seem like I was ignoring your suggestion, thank you for taking interest.  It's just my PW has a subrace/culture setup... and to tell the truth I've never even considered playing a dwarf.  I normally stick to humans.  <br><br>Not just for the feat, mostly because I like the cultures they have and the ability to RP more out of the box without looking cliche'.  I mean, you can only see so many "I'm breaking the mold" characters (Especially Drow...) before it leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  <br><br>I saw that build first on the Epic Character Builds page, as the Undead Lord.  Using 30 levels of PM (I think) and learning the spells from scrolls.  What level setup would you suggest?

What level setup? In low magic? At least 10 Fighter pre-epic. Most possible PM.... I do not like builds that rely heavily on PM for some reason, as the offense usually disappears down the drain, and that is way outta my playstyle. Fighter16/Wiz5/PM19. <br><br>But going Fighter/Bard/PM should work wonders.<br>Fighter4/Bard20/PM16. Epic Warding, Lasting Inspiration and loads of swell Bard powers, your world considered.<br>Bard/RDD/PM should also be sweeeet. No idea how to best level it, since I lack knowledge of your server.<br><br>In such a world I would make a Cleric/Fighter/Whatever. But since you refuse both that and offensive caster, I would go with Bard.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Well, there's always the ultimate low-magic build, Kail's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225446", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Order of Jormundgandr</a>.  It's a dragon with full Cleric casting and Monk for Wis to AC.  Very playable, too, as a caster cleric with extra spell slots from Druid and excellent spell DCs.  And then you get Dragon Shape at 33 and everyone goes home.<br><br>The Fighter/Bard/PM is also an excellent build in low-magic settings.  <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "253956", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Here</a>'s Kail's take on it.

As with most things in life, every build I try seems to fail in some respect.  I knew it was going to happen, and sure enough Clerics are getting nerfed to *** soon.  Mostly just the Heal/Harm spells, but possible a few other things.<br><br>There are so many things I want to try out, I've taken a lot of these into consideration.  That is to say.. I've been playing single-player more than Online to test these builds.  <br><br>HIPS, Terrifying Rage, Sneak attack, all that in one build?  Doesn't that kind of generalization (while very impressive to fit that all in..) kind of kill your overall playability?
