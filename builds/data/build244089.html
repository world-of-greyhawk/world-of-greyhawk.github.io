But bardsongs will tip it up to 16 more in your favor.<br><br>The trick with this build comes now. You must use all that is in your power to catch your opponent Flat-footed. Then slam him with a touch attack, mostly used is harm. If there is no healers around, then HiPS and Harm a few, then slam them with cursesong, Icestorm or limitless other possibilities. This guy could fell the 3 35 level fighters(the lvl 40'ies are naked) and a prismatic Dragon unbuffed and buck naked in -Novice to Epic module. As for the AB, well, fully buffed+ and with prayer, battletide and cursesong you should be able to defeat any but the most resistent in PvM. If you think the build lacks punch, remember you have the full spell-range of both Bard and cleric, and will quickly become the main event in your party.  Not that you will have to much trouble soloing, as long as you can rest once in a while.<br><br>When you catch some flat-footed with a touch-attack all AC they keep is the deflection AC, that's it. With uncanny dodge they keep their DEX too. When someone has true seeing, try to dispel it, use darkness (you can have a few) With your ultravision. If they have both, and you can't dispel it, you might try to harm them still, or use greater snactuary, rebuff and let loose everything you have. Main weakness in this build is lack of UMD, you might wanna get more INT or switch from spellcraft. Starting stats were a real problem. Spell DC's with Evocation are half-decent, but that's it. Not sure how much use the penetration is, but if you can't use spells on your adversary, you might be in trouble.<br><br><b>pro's</b><br>-Spells.

I can definitely see this build's potential as a buff/debuff and offensive spellcaster, but I think I would suggest giving up on using spells with saving throws (freeing feats from spell foci and possibly stat points from wisdom).

I like the build.

A good one Grim, my two favourite classes plus SD in one build. This is the typical combination that makes me wish for 50 lvls to go with.<br><br>When penetration is problematic (I know you all will get it the right way <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  ) a Mord from a scroll should get it right. Xylo suggests a nice alternative too, with STR and CON pumped up a little melee performance will be increased.
