Okay, all the posting about Clerics vs. Druids etc, made me want to make a nifty druid build. I dunno whether a similar one has been featured before, since I only got through the first 2 threads before getting lazy. I did several searches, and they didn't turn up anything, so here it is:<br><br>Human, 32 Druid/6 Monk/2 Shadowdancer, Lawful Neutral<br>10str/14dex/10con/12int/18wis/8cha<br>Take +Wis at every level.<br>Skills: 43 Concentration, 43 Discipline, 43 Hide, 43 Move Silent, 40 Spellcraft, 40 Tumble, Rest (12 I think, but I didn't write it down) Persuade<br><br>Levelling: 6 Druid/1 Monk/1 Shadowdancer/7 Druid/1 Monk/7 Druid/1 Monk/9 Druid/1 Monk/1 Shadowdancer/2 Druid/1 Monk/1 Druid/1 Monk<br><br>Feats:<br>(Druid 1-6)<br>1-Dodge<br>1-Mobility<br>3-Spell Penetration<br>6-Greater Spell Penetration<br>(Monk 7)-Take Discipline, Hide, Move Silent, Tumble<br>(Shadow Dancer<br>(Druid 9-15)<br>9-Toughness<br>12-Weapon Focus: Unarmed Strike<br>15-Improved Critical: Unarmed Strike<br>(Monk 16, for Skill Updates)<br>(Druid 17-23)<br>18-Empower Spell<br>21-Epic Spell Penetration<br>(Monk 24)<br>24-Great Wisdom I<br>(Druid 25-33)<br>27-Great Wisdom II<br>28-Great Wisdom III<br>30-Armor Skin<br>32-Great Wisdom IV<br>33-Dragon Shape<br>(Monk 34)<br>(Shadow Dancer 35)<br>(Druid 36-37)<br>36-Epic Weapon Focus: Unarmed Strike<br>(Monk 38)<br>(Druid 39)<br>39-Great Wisdom V<br>39-Great Wisdom VI<br>(Monk 40)<br><br>Pros:<br>Epic Level Caster with good spell DC's.<br>Has 35 AC with a robe in 'Human Form'<br>Excellent Melee in Dragon Forms<br>Good Melee &amp; Immunity to Crits in Elemental Forms<br>Excellent Stealth, with Hide in Plain Sight<br><br>Basically, this character has several modes of play, you can sneak around and blast people as a druid (hit &amp; hide), change into elemental/dragon form if somebody gets too close and starts meleeing, or you're fighting very high spell resistance opponents. Or, you can summon your level 32 animal companion &amp; elemental swarm while sitting behind them and blasting/countering, later switching to dragon form if they die. Also, this character can gain immunity to any of the elements by using the correct form.<br><br>Cons:<br>I'm sure there are some, but on the whole I think this is a pretty robust character. I didn't see any glaring weaknesses. I guess the weakest point is you only have about 380hp in Human Form. The other thing, is that you're going to be very good at Persuading, unless you change the starting stats to 8 con or str and 14 int.
