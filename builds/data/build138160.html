Greetings.<br><br>This is my first post to this amazin forum and i would love any input that you experts could give.<br><br>I got the idea from watching a lvl 33 shifter simply destroy a dungeon level that consisted mostly of beholders, without even really taking damage.  I asked him some questions and with alot of revision, i have come up with this build (thanks to Douglas Crews' fantastic shifter guide).<br><br>Here's what i figured: human  lawful neutral<br>str 10  dex 13  int 14  con 10  wis 17 cha 10<br><br>1 druid1      alertness/ toughness<br>2 druid2<br>3 druid3      weapon finesse<br>4 druid4     wis +1<br>5 monk1<br>6 monk2       dodge<br>7 monk3<br>8 monk4      wis +1  <br>9 druid5      greater cleave<br>10 shifter1<br>11 shifter2<br>12 shifter3   wis +1  weapon focus (unarm)<br>13 shifter4<br>14 shifter5<br>15 shifter6    improved crit (unarmd)<br>16 shifter7   wis +1<br>17 shifter8 <br>18 shifter9    expertise<br>19 shifter10<br>20 monk5    wis +1<br><br>Note: natural AC 22  wisdom 22<br>-&gt; the skills up to this point<br>    druid - spellcraft  conc  heal  lore<br>    shifter - concentration lore heal<br>    monk - conc heal lore discipline tumble<br>The skills i chose were because I am not sure about how shifts are done (does nwn consider them a cast? then conc is very important).  Tumble is a must for AC.  Spellcraft, you can get to about 11 or so at lvl 9 i chose to take it also as a cc skill all along. <br><br>Now the Epic lvls:<br>21 shifter11    UNDEAD SHAPE<br>22 shifter12<br>23 shifter13    Greater wisdom (GW) I<br>24 shifter14   wis +1   GW II    (wisdom = 25)<br>25 shifter15  <br>26 shifter16    OUTSIDE SHAPE<br>27 shifter17       GW III         (wisdom = 26)<br>28 shifter18    wis +1            (wisdom = 27)<br>29 shifter19     CONSTRUCT SHAPE<br>30 shifter20       GW IV          (wisdom = 28)<br>31 shifter21<br>32 shifter22    wis +1  GW V       (wisdom = 30)<br>33 shifter23      DRAGON SHAPE<br>34 shifter24<br>35 shifter25      GW VI<br>36 shifter26    wis +1  ARMOR SKIN<br>37 shifter27   <br>38 shifter28      GW VII<br>39 shifter29      Epic weapon focus (unarm)<br>40 monk6         wis +1<br><br>By my calculations, we end with a Wisdom of 34 and a natural armor class of 29 =:shades:<br><br>a note again on skills: i held a ton of skils for the last monk lvl to get<br>42 tumble (+8 AC  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    )<br>42 Lore<br>42 discipline (monk lvls)<br>42 concentration <br>42 Heal<br>20 spellcraft (druid lvls + cc lvls)<br>15 Hide<br>That should account for all skills.<br><br>I chose the lvl progression aftr several attempts to see what works best.  I chose the monk lvls to be taken right after the druid lvls primarily because i am creatin her on a persistant world and i dont want to have an xp penalty for any time!   <br><br>Also, I started this char with the above stats, then tried to figure out how to get circle kick as well (for an extra attck).  You can do it, but it puts the construct and dragon shapes out til lvl 37 i believe so i chose to not worry about that.<br><br>I thank you in advance for any suggestions.<br><br>Peace<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 20:09</span></i></p>

Heres a build I like.  Its not a shifter but you could make a shifter similar to it.  The plus is that it gets a +5 enhancement to all of its unarmed attacks. <br><br>Monk 20\ Druid 20<br>=====================<br>Human: Lawful Neutral<br>=====================<br>Start stats---	<br>Str	8<br>Dex	14<br>Con	10<br>Int	14<br>Wis	18<br>Cha	8<br><br>Finish Stats--	<br>Str	8<br>Dex	14<br>Con	10<br>Int	14<br>Wis	31<br>Cha	8<br><br>Level Progression<br>1	Monk<br>2-6	Druid<br>7-21	Monk<br>22-23	Druid<br>24 	Monk<br>25-36	Druid<br>37-39	Monk<br>40 	Druid<br><br>Level<br>1 	Disarm, Expertise<br>3	Extend Spell<br>6	Zen Archery*<br>9	Weapon Focus(unarmed Strike)*<br>12 	Improved Critical(unarmed strike)*<br>15	Improved Expertise<br>18	Improved Disarm<br>21	Improved Ki Stike+4*<br>24	Improved Ki Stike+5*<br>27	Great Wisdom I*<br>30	Great Wisdom II*<br>33	Great Wisdom III*<br>36	Dragon Shape*<br>39	Epic Weapon Focus(unarmed)*<br>	<br>TONS of Points<br>Discipline: +42 Hide: +40 Listen: +20 Move Silently: +40 Tumble: +41 Concentration: +43 Heal: +32 Spellcraft: +43<br><br>If you are saying  to yourself hey he sure has a lot of hide\move silent points why didn't he work toward a level of SD.  Well on the server I play SD's aren't allowed.  You get 9th level druid spells, permenant +5 fists, dragon shape, a spell resistance of 28, and 70 something AC.  Once bioware fixes the Dragon hide to where it has a +5 DR hide it may be more viable to take a lot less monk levels.  If you wanted to make it a shifter do the level progression the same up until level 22 where you would take level 22 and 23 shifter then at level 24 monk for ki strike +5 then shifter the rest of the way.  You would get all the shapes and still have +5 fists for your unarmed attacks... oh... and don't forget kobold commando and his nice HIPS ability.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Gonij on 07/02/04 22:36</span></i></p>

To my knowledge the weapon focus/improved crit for unarmed doesn't work with shifter forms(at the very least about half the forms are armed), but finess does. You may with to consider taking epic prowerss instead , and using the other feats for whatever you desire (toughness and blind fight would be good picks). You could drop down your monk levels to just 1. You still will get flrry of blows and the AC modifier, as well as evasion. Monk doesn't give you much from level 2-5. You could also then take monk as your last level and not usffer the xp penalty. You can stop putting points into tumble at 40, and you probably don't need that much lore (unless they are using the pnp epic spell system on your PW).
