hey guys. I have heard that divine power was changed in the new patch, yet i cant seem to find out where this is stated in the patch description.  Is it in 1.69 or is it before?  Anyone know where they found that it was changed?  <br><br>Thanks for the help. <br><br>av

I think it used to go like this.  Let's say you're a level 20 cleric with 20 strength and 15 BAB.  +5 weapon.  So you're looking at 25/20/15.<br><br>Divine Power makes that 30/25/20/30.<br><br>If you're hasted, you get 25/20/15/25.<br><br>I think it USED to be that Divine Power and Haste gave 30/25/20/30/30.  And if you're using flurry of flows (using the same AB for the sake of simplicity) you'd get 28/23/18/28/28/28.<br><br>Now, the extra attacks receive a -5 penalty.  So...<br><br>DP + Haste = 30/25/20/30/25.<br>DP + Haste + FoB = 28/23/18/28/23/18.<br><br>At least, I think that's the case.

thanks magic, i know how it used to work.  It was more beneficial to have a 3apr than 4apr cleric for the simple reason that div power gave you the 4th attack at full ab, so you would have 30/25/20/30 vs 25/20/15 without.<br><br>I have been hearing though, that it was changed.

Huh.  I was convinced that it was 1.69 that made the change, though I don't recall ever seeing any documentation.  I'm pretty sure though, that w/ 1.68, I was still exploiting DP and haste with regularity.<br><br>Honestly though, it's still a very handy thing to have 3 APR.

Er...no.  I'll test the monk/cleric later, but here at my results with 1.69 and a level 20 cleric.<br><br>Initial AB is 29/24/19.

I tend to think of it as a 3rd hand of sorts.

Avado, the change for the typical cleric build means that if you're hasted, the divine power attack comes at the full attack bonus -5 instead of at the full attack bonus.<br><br>If you also have flurry of blows, it comes at a -10 penalty.<br><br>That's the only change.

Kail is correct.  I promise.<br><br>Edit: and, yes, I agree with your assessment.  The change in DP/Haste is no reason to go for 4 apr w/ your clerics.  Sure, it's not quite as awesome.  Still totally worthwhile.  If you don't have haste, then... well, there's no difference.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By onion eater on 01/19/09 20:22</span></i></p>

I wrote the correct schedule somewhere else, I'm not sure where... it goes as Magic Master says. My way of explaining it is that all the bonus attacks per round add up like a third hand.<br><br>Example, say you're a Monk with 9 BAB, which gives the lowest APR you can get on a Monk: 3, and you use Divine Power + Flurry of Blows + Haste + Improved Two Weapon Fighting, you'd get:<br><br>+40/+37/+34/+40/+35/+40/+35/+30/+25/+20 \\ 10 APR, that's the max.<br><br>The first three "+40/+37/+34" are the regular stuff.<br><br>The next two "+40/+35" are the off-hand.<br><br>The next five "+40/+35/+30/+25/+20" come from adding 3 from Divine Power, 1 from Haste and 1 from Flurry of Blows.<br><br>The previous way it worked would give you +40/+37/+34/+40/+35/+40/+40/+40/+40/+40 <br>I remeber I once made a build that did that but of course, the ending AB value was not good since it capped AB at a low value, I don't remeber which exactly. That schedule is dead with 1.69.<br><br>Kail should be right about it being in version 1.68, I only know it was before 1.69. I'm not testing this right now, but I'm 100% sure that DP, Haste and FoB stack like a third hand.<br><br>I hope that clears your doubts avado. Overall, only low BAB Monks end up losing AB when exploiting Divine Power compared to a high BAB build.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 01/19/09 20:49</span></i></p>

Avado, you could make a ranged cleric and only focus on wis/cha.  Divine Might for 8+ damage, Divine Favor for 5 damage, Battletide for 2 damage, Prayer for 1 damage.

yes a cha-cleric is viable.  ANY cleric with 26+ lvls is viable (i was lookin at c26/pal9/hs5)...  especially going c20 pre-epic, or maybe 19c/1p.. its the stat split.  If only there was an intuitive attack...

Thanks grizz.  Yeah 28 wis, with less charisma is a very nice way to go.  I was trying to make a 3/4 class (cleric) work with 20 wis 26 charisma or somethin like that.  It really doesnt work that well, cuz, in my mind the AB is too low to have fun...  though the damage could be nice for short periods...<br><br>thats why i sort of left the idea.  I really wanted a consensus of Divine Power!  muhahahahahahahaha !!  I think that THAT is more valuable to the guild than a cheesy go nowhere charisma cleric (told you i do HATE that charimsa cleric idea!).

Hmmm, yeah, I think I know what you mean, I remember watching a +45 on feedback rolls while using Flurry of Blows when my highest ended as +43 a few times. It was the Hasted roll since it wasn't a Cleric, but I never tested about that I just regarded it as a bug that would be corrected eventually, and I don't know if 1.69 has that roll corrected. I made a few tests on Divine Power once, I don't remeber which version but it was before 1.68... but it's a bother to find those, I posted them on the Request Forum when I was trying to make the highest APR exploit build and the topic got lost in the shadows of the big amount of requests there, that test could tell how the rolls worked on earlier versions, I don't have time to find it right now. I could test it again in the new version, but that'll have to wait a few days, maybe until the week-end. If you're dying to know you could test it yourself and tell us.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/24/09 23:07</span></i></p>

Ok, no more wrong numbers, I found my <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "16203", "234617", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Divine Power Exploit</a> testing post, so here's the real progression you would get on older versions with 9 BAB + kama ITWF + Flurry of Blows + Haste + divine Power:<br><br>+34/+31/+28/+36/+36/+36/+36/+34/+29<br><br>I still don't know why the test got 9 APR instead of 10, but heck, this AB progress doesn't happen in the newest version so it probably doesn't matter anymore.

If you have 20 or less levels than you get (Character level -1)/5 - (BAB -1)/5 extra attacks where both (character level -1)/5 and (BAB-1)/5 are assumed to be rounded down.  So, in short, DP extra attacks are based on the regular progression, rather than the monk progression.<br><br>Thus it would be better to have a pre-epic BAB of 10 to get another monk attack and still get the two DP attacks.

Ok then, final test of Divine Power Exploit, version 1.69:<br><br>Build: Monk 1 / Cleric 6 / Wizard 13. It's a level 20 with 10 BAB, 22 DEX, 13 INT, 16 WIS, all the rest 8 (don't ask why). Feats: Weapon Focus: kama, Improved Two Weapon Fighting (TWF and Ambidexterity), Weapon Finesse. Strength Domain to get Divine Power as level 3 spell and Haste from Wizard spells, this should cover everything.<br><br>---------- Feedback rolls ----------<br><br>Single kama no buffs:<br><br>+17 / +14 / +11 / +8<br><br>Flurry of Blows:<br><br>+15 / +12 / +9 / +6 / +15<br><br>Divine Power + Haste:<br><br>+27 / +24 / +21 / +18 / +27 / +22 / +18<br><br>Divine Power + Haste + Flurry of Blows:<br><br>+25 / +22 / +19 / +16 / +25 / +20 / +15 / +10<br><br><br><br>Dual-wielding no buffs:<br><br>+15 / +12 / +9 / +6 / +15 / +10<br><br>Flurry of Blows:<br><br>+13 / +10 / +7 / +4 / <b>+15</b> / +13 / +8<br><br>Divine Power + Haste:<br><br>+25 / +22 / +19 / +16 / <b>+27 / +22 / +17</b> / +25 / +20<br><br>Divine Power + Haste + Flurry of Blows<br><br>+23 / +20 / +17 / +14 / <b>+25 / +20 / +15 / +10</b> / +23 / +18<br><br>Note: Bolded numbers that do not follow all the proper calculations.<br><br>---------- End of test ----------<br><br>For the order, the first set is made by the normal progression, the second set starts with the extra stuff (FoB, DP, Haste) and the last set is the off-hand. So, here's my conclusion:<br><br>Flurry of Blows works perfectly, and affects the extra attacks and the off-hand attacks like it should. What doesn't work properly is that the dual-wielding penalty does not appear on the extra attacks, just as WhiZard mentioned, and it was not corrected.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
