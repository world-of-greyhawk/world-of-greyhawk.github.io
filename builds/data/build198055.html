I loved the Kukri Master build at the Epic build section and I wanted to see if I could improve it slighly, this is what I came up, this one has better AC, better AB (I dont know the original AB but I bet this is better. :)), UMD (You can enchant your kukris, keen and darkfire/flame weapon them if you find the right scrolls, even use premonition, improved visibility or true strike...), he can Taunt and the use weakest bardsong (its weak but it helps)...<br><br>He has worse saves because he has no CoT levels, I tried to give him a bit of a boost to them via spellcraft, but I would be very careful against other dev crit fighters, because the bonus spellcraft saves dont apply there. I gave him better STR for better dev crit DC, AB and damage, that extra str (4 points) can be put into Con in order to get better HP and fortitude saves at the cost of 2 AB, Dev Crit DC and damage. He also has less features, but I think he has enough this way.<br><br>Note: I gave him skills each 5 levels because I wanted the level sequence to be read more easily, it can be 1 per level, I listed different versions for this char depending on which skills you prefer, its listed after the levelling order.<br><br>Human: Non lawful, True neutral Or neutral chaotic if you want no smites on you.<br><br>Str: 16 (30)<br>Dex: 15<br>Con: 14<br>Int: 14 <br>Wis: 8<br>Cha: 8<br><br>01: FTR: Ambidexterity, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Proficiency Exotic<br>02: FTR: Weapon Focus: Kukri, Discipline(5), Lore(5)<br>03: FTR: Dodge<br>04: FTR: STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Kukri<br>05: FTR<br>06: FTR: Mobility, Spring Attack<br>07: FTR: Discipline(5), Lore(5)<br>08: FTR: STR+1, Expertise<br>09: FTR: Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>10: FTR: Whirlwind Attack<br>11: WM<br>12: WM: STR+1, Knockdown, Discipline(5), Lore(5)<br>13: WM<br>14: WM<br>15: WM: Improved Knockdown<br>16: WM: STR+1<br>17: WM: Discipline(5), Lore(5)<br>18: WM: Improved Critical: Kukri<br>19: WM<br>20: WM: STR+1<br>21: WM: Epic Weapon Focus: Kukri<br>22: WM: Discipline(5), Lore(5)<br>23: WM: Blind Fight<br>24: FTR: STR+1, Epic Weapon Specialization: Kukri<br>25: WM<br>26: WM<br>27: WM: Great Strength I, Great Strength II, Discipline(5), Lore(5)<br>28: WM: STR+1<br>29: WM<br>30: WM: Overwhelming Critical: Kukri, Devastating Critical: Kukri<br>31: WM<br>32: WM: STR+1, Discipline(5), Lore(5)<br>33: WM: Armor Skin, Epic Prowess<br>34: WM<br>35: WM<br>36: WM: STR+1, Toughness, Great Strength III<br>37: WM: Discipline(5), Lore(5)<br>38: WM<br>39: WM: Great Strength IV, Epic Will<br>40: BRD: STR+1, Discipline(3), Lore(3), Perform(5), Spellcraft(43),<br>Tumble(40), UMD(43)<br><br>HP: 516 (Enough to survive)<br><br>(I calculate everything with mundane kukris)<br>AB: 30(Base) +10(Str) +1(WF) +2(EWF) +1(Epic Prowess) +1(Superior Weapon Focus) +6(Epic Superior Weapon Focus*6) -2(Dual wield) = 49AB<br><br>Attack Schedule:<br>Main Hand: +49/+44/+39/+34 =&gt; +50/+45/+40/+35 With Bard Song, 10 rounds a day<br>Off Hand:  +49/+44         =&gt; +50/+45 With Bard Song, 10 rounds a day<br><br>Damage: (Not much, I know)<br>Main hand: 1d4 + 10(str) +2(WS) +4(EWS) = 1d4 +16 [+17 if playing bardsong]<br>Off Hand: 1d4 +5(str) +2(WS) +4(EWS) = 1d4 +11 [+12 if playing bardsong]<br><br>Critical Hits:<br><br>The devastating critical DC seems to be wrong at the grimoire, I think it is (correct me if I'm wrong):<br>Devastating Critical DC: 10(Base) + 20(Half char level) +10(STR) = 40DC //Fairly dangerous<br>Critical damage: x3 + 2d6<br>Critical range: 13-20 // 40% [I may be wrong]<br>Keen Critical range: 10-20// 55% [I may be wrong]<br><br>AC: 10(Base) +1(Dex Only 1 applies with plate on) +8(Tumble) +2(Armor Skin) = 21 (Not great but you should add your armor over it, I think it is good enough for a plater).<br><br>Skills:<br>43 (53) Discipline<br>5  (4)  Perform [We have a level on bard, why not use bardsong?]<br>43 (45) Spellcraft [Is it +8 or +9 to saves?

This is the revised version. He ends up having 2 less str (So 1 less AB, 1 less damage and 1 less dev crit DC), a bit worse will saves (I had to drop iron will in order to get other feats, it still can be traded for thoughness), and 20 more HP (536 HP).<br><br>One more mistake I did commit was I forgot about cleave and great cleave, they are prerequisites for dev.crit. And I had to "pay for it". It ends up being not-as good. But good enough IMHO. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>It's developed "on paper" (My new PC hasn't arrived yet), using the newest Character Build Calculator and looking carefully at the grimoire.

overall, the idea of using a bard in combination with a WM for dev crit kukri is very good. and the damage should be excellent.<br>what i might suggets, to make him easier to play, is to take away 3 WM lvls<br>give him 2 more bard and 1 more fighetr (or just 3 more bard) now you can sing more, and you get an extra fighter feat (with which you can raise your saves, like luck of heroes? or maybe lasting inspiration for bard? or an epic skill focus?) also, this allows you to take your first bard at lvl 21 and do a nice skill dumpt there and get tumble, umd, taunt and spellcraft or what ever you wish.<br><br>you also get +1 extra to damage and +1 will and fort saves.<br><br>all you really loose is +1 AB and Epic Toughness<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By aluka on 06/14/05 02:11</span></i></p>

Yes, thats a good idea too. I only use this kind of builds where you get the big OOMHP! on level 40 on really fast levelling worlds.<br><br>The more bard levels the better song, buffs and the earlier the build matures (Because the skills).<br><br>I like the idea of trading 3wm levels or even more for a much better bard song (I like bards because they help groups easier than anybody). The only problem I see is the really low cha. You will get spells you wont be able to use. Maybe dropping your str a bit more and putting some on Cha could help with 1rd or even 2nd circle spells in order to get some buffs and make up the str and wm levels loss.<br><br>I will think on it. This was only something I considered a sligh improvement over the Kukri Master build. This is a bit more PvM oriented too. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  (I wouldnt PvP with his saves).<br><br>Thanks for the feedback.

What CD said...<br><br>yeah,  Lasting Inspiration is bard 21, i meant lingering.. 5 more rounds is good.<br><br>i think he does actually gain a bonus if he takes 12 fighter lvls.<br>i mean Grizz, all he looses is Epic Toughness I and +1 AB, nothing more<br>13 armor skin<br>16 epic prowess<br>19 epic W focus<br>22 Over crit<br>25 Dev crit<br>28 Epic toghness... &lt;- do you really care?<br>these are all the bonus WM feats he can take.<br><br>He can more blind fight to a fighter bonus lvl and take Epic will or anything like that<br><br>witha few more bard lvls, you dont take them for spell casting, but for a few more skills and a few more songs and UMD.<br><br>I think that having only 1 song is almost useless since you get it only at 40. but if he is getting bard at lvl 21, then he can start using scrolls sooner and buff himself and his weapons and so on.<br><br>being able to cast Flame Weapon at lvl 21 for this build will make its hits that much more powerful<br><br>even if he takes those 3 lvls as fighetr and gets 2 more feats, its still much better than 28 of WM.<br><br><br>but thats just me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By aluka on 06/14/05 23:26</span></i></p>

just did a quick run through this build in the halls..<br>and heres what I've got.<br><br>drop 1 feat and take 14 lvls of fighter.<br>power attack at 12 and cleave at 14<br>greater cleave instead of something<br>IKD?<br><br>you get -1 AB, but the damage is the same since i was able to keep STR at 30<br>and you get Dev crit<br><br>this is a very feat hungry build
