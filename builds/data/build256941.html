This is a power house duel-wielding SD with epic dodge.

Also, some might question 22 SD levels, but have the epic shadowlord is a nice distraction to set up the kill.  <br><br>Fighter(8), Champion of Torm(10), Shadowdancer(22)<br><br>Half Elf, any non evil alignment<br>PvM, Playable 1-40<br><br>STR: 14<br>DEX: 16 (30)<br>CON: 10<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 14<br><br><br>01: Fighter(1): Weapon Finesse, Ambidexterity<br>02: Fighter(2): Two-Weapon Fighting<br>03: Fighter(3): Weapon Focus: Mace<br>04: Fighter(4): DEX+1, Weapon Specialization: Mace, (DEX=17)<br>05: Fighter(5)<br>06: Fighter(6): Knockdown, Dodge<br>07: Fighter(7)<br>08: Champion of Torm(1): DEX+1,(DEX=18)<br>09: Champion of Torm(2): Improved Critical: Mace, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>10: Champion of Torm(3): {Smite Evil}<br>11: Champion of Torm(4): Improved Knockdown<br>12: Champion of Torm(5): DEX+1, Mobility, (DEX=19)<br>13: Champion of Torm(6): Power Attack<br>14: Champion of Torm(7)<br>15: Champion of Torm(8): Toughness, Cleave<br>16: Champion of Torm(9): DEX+1,(DEX=20)<br>17: Champion of Torm(10): Great Cleave<br>18: Shadowdancer(1): Improved Initiative, {Hide in Plain Sight}<br>19: Shadowdancer(2): {Darkvision, Evasion, Uncanny Dodge I}<br>20: Shadowdancer(3): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br>21: Fighter(8): Epic Weapon Focus: Mace, Epic Weapon Specialization: Mace<br>22: Shadowdancer(4):  <br>23: Shadowdancer(5): {Defensive Roll}<br>24: Shadowdancer(6): DEX+1, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=23)<br>25: Shadowdancer(7): {Slippery Mind}<br>26: Shadowdancer(8)<br>27: Shadowdancer(9): Great Dexterity II,  , (DEX=24)<br>28: Shadowdancer(10): DEX+1,  , {Improved Evasion}, (DEX=25)<br>29: Shadowdancer(11)<br>30: Shadowdancer(12): Epic Dodge<br>31: Shadowdancer(13): Superior Initiative<br>32: Shadowdancer(14): DEX+1, (DEX=26)<br>33: Shadowdancer(15): Epic Skill Focus: Move Silently<br>34: Shadowdancer(16): Epic Skill Focus: Hide<br>35: Shadowdancer(17):  <br>36: Shadowdancer(18): DEX+1, Great Dexterity III, (DEX=28)<br>37: Shadowdancer(19): Epic Shadowlord<br>38: Shadowdancer(20):  <br>39: Shadowdancer(21): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=29)<br>40: Shadowdancer(22): DEX+1, Epic Skill Focus: Heal, (DEX=30)<br><br>Hitpoints: 396<br>Skillpoints: 260<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 28/20/37<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +2<br>BAB: 29<br>AB (max, naked): 42 (melee), 39 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 26/28<br><br>Heal 43(52), Hide 30(50), Move Silently 28(48), Tumble 30(40)<br><br>Thoughts always welcomed.<br><br><br><i>Added alignment and playability range - Kail Pendragon</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/30/06 16:49</span></i></p>

With no Sneaks, I would go STR based to increase damage. If you change the race to Human you can drop ESF: Hide and Move Silently, max out Hide and Move Silently, then get Overwhelming Critical and Devastating Critical, or two other feats if Dev Crit is banned. If no Dev Crit then you can probably drop Great Cleave. Boosting STR would lower your stealth some, though.

Good point about human.  Need the dex based for the 25 Dex required for epic dodge, but you'd be surprised how much damage this fellow puts out as is with 5 attacks (6 hasted)and some buffs.

Granted, buffs must come from someone else.  Damage output is respectable with 5 attacks almost always landing and crit output is decent.  As long as you can hit, do damage, and avoid being hit, I call that success.<br>_________________<br>TeoDeathDealer<br>Member of SoulForge PW (Action)

Given a +5 environment, you're going to be doing 14-19 damage on your main hand, 13-18 off hand.  It's pretty common for builds to have 9/- DR, reducing that to 5-10 and 4-9.  Dwarven Defenders aren't going to be taking any damage at all.  And things get worse in lower-magic environments, or places with DR gear.<br><br>PvM, you're also in trouble against anything with DR that your weapons won't get through.<br><br>Really, though, this is a problem for all non-sneaking dexers, and you just have to accept that you're only going to do significant damage on servers that let you put additional damage types on your weapons.  Frankly, with 14 str, EWS, and bludgeoning damage, you're doing better than a lot of builds.<br><br>*edit* typo<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Nimueh_Leafbow on 10/31/06 20:30</span></i></p>
