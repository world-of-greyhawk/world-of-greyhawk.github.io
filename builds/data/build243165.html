Obviously the build would be better off without the Harper Scout level , but it seems to work with just that 1 level.  I had originally considered making a Dex build out of this with 5 HS levels, but without sneak attack and not enough ability boosts to get strength up for Dev. Crit in addition to Dex for Epic Dodge, the build would have been just one more low damage Dex build of which there are way too many.  <br><br>As it is, the Tenebrous Harper Minstrel doesn't deal a heck of a lot of damage, but has a great AB when buffed and taunting, and does 3 kinds of damage with Bard Song singing and his trusty halberd swinging.  With 57 fully buffed taunt, he's pretty likely to get the max penalty on his opponent.  Not to be overlooked is the 18-20 x3 crit, which, when it lands, can inflict some serious pain.  Curse Song and Dirge help a lot too.<br><br>His AC may be a touch low, but I like to think that Improved Invisibility, Shadow Evade, and Ethereal Visage make up for that.  If enemies do land a blow they take 29 damage from Wounding Whispers.  Having 29 levels of Bard also makes his spells pretty difficult to dispel except maybe by some ueber mages.<br><br>I managed to make get his HP into the 'fair' range by taking some more CON and toughness at the end of the build.<br><br>I apologize for not having a great intro.  I've just been a little busy to think up much lately.  Maybe in the future.<br><br><br><i>Edited Title - Kail Pendragon</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 06/08/06 08:52</span></i></p>

Like you said, definitely better off without the Harper Scout. You trade two pre-epic feats for Great Charisma, and then take two pre-epic feats in epic anyway. Iron Will is somewhat justifiable, I suppose, but Alertness really isn't important enough to lose out on an epic feat for. Dropping Harper and the two pre-requisite feats and then taking Curse Song and Toughness Pre-Epic would open up two feats, one of which could easily be Great Charisma.<br><br>I know, you probably know this already, though, and you pointed out that the build would be better off without Harper.

As the build stands now, I recommend changing the Alertness feat to level 18. SInce it's not necessary except as a prereq to HS, take it as late as possible and move your other feats up. That way you get the benefit of feats you're actually using a few levels earlier.<br><br>I'd also drop Halberd in favor of Greataxe. Two damage types on a weapon is still bugged, so damage resistance to one type will mean resistance to both types.<br><br>Also, I'm not sure of this (and haven't tested it), but I think I recall reading that the extra damage from Bard Song is not actually bludgeoning (even though it states it is on the character sheet), but the same damage type as your weapon. Again, I'm not positive about this though.<br><br>Another thing I might consider is dropping 4 levels of SD in favor of the other 4 HS levels. Take 4 HS pre-epic and use the HS bonus feat at level 1 for Curse Song. This will give you an extra epic feat to work with (for Epic Prowess, Armor Skin, maybe Epic Fortitude - or, drop Toughness and take that freed up feat as GRTt CON as well as trading the Toughness feat for another GRT CON. That way you end up with the same amount of HPs, but +1 on Fort saves). The 5th HS level in epic will allow you to take your GRT CHA feat.<br><br>You lose Improved Evasion and Slippery Mind (SM isn't that big a deal, and since Reflex is your best save, you can probably afford to lose Imp Ev as well).  You'll end up with better Will saves if you go Bard 16/HS 4, or better Reflex <i>and</i> Will saves if you go Bard 12/SD 4/HS 4 in pre-epic.

Another thought occurs to me as well: what armor is this character intended to wear? If it's anything with arcane spell failure involved, then you'll need Still Spell to cast Wounding Whispers and Haste, unless you think you'll have the chance to do the 'strip off the armor to cast' dance before every battle (although I'm coming to believe that Extend Spell is much more useful for a Bard build).<br><br>Another tweak I'd suggest re the pre-epic feats: move Iron Will later as well, as your high save is Will anyway. So, at level 15 take Iron Will and at level 18 take Alertness.<br><br>Also, once you get Evasion from SD level 2, take Bard again, saving the next 2 SD levels for character levels 19 and 20. The SD levels 3 and 4 bring very little to the build, so more Bard earlier on is better to increase your spell durations, power, and Bard Song quicker.<br><br>*edited* spelling.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 06/07/06 16:32</span></i></p>

I'm shocked this build lacks UMD skill points.  This would enable you to use all kinds of nice restricted gear (monk robes, etc.).

Yeah, I guess I ignore UMD because I'm trying to build without assuming there will be any kind of equipment to help.  Feel free to redistribute points to UMD as you wish.

I guess its possible to live without them though, heh.  The alternative would be to take all 6 SD levels pre-epic, but then I would lose 1 AB.<br><br>Edit: Thanks for the subject change.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Ythaniel on 06/08/06 15:07</span></i></p>
