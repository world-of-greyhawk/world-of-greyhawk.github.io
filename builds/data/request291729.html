Got a PM from someone who's not yet a member, so can't post here. The following is the meat of it:<br><br><i>The idea behind the characters of this certain faction is that they are the 'natives' of this land. They -must- have atleast 1 level of Barbarian, they -must- use spears as their weapons, and they -must- use clothe armor.<br><br>Character -must- be Human.<br><br>Ontop of such, they may -only- use any of the follow classes, due to disdain towards magics:<br><br>Base Classes:<br>Barbarian (Mandatory. every Amouk'Fruan MUST have this as there starting class)<br>Fighter,<br>Monk,<br>Ranger,<br>Rogue,<br><br>Prestige:<br>Assassin,<br>BlackGuard,<br>Champion of Torm,<br>Shadow Dancer,<br>Weapon Master.<br><br>On another note, the items they use revolve around bonuses to Hide and Move Silent.<br><br>So, what do you think? Think you guys could get together and work out an ideal build for this faction?</i><br><br>Thought I'd toss it here to get some input, as I don't know when I'll be able to devote any significant time it.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Well, Human Barbarian with spears... no Dwarven Defender or any caster types... well, it's not the kind of build I'd use, but with such a limited arrangement there isn't much to do.<br><br>Because of the weapon and class specifications, I'd take Fighter with Epic Weapon Specialization for any STR-based build possible here, like a Ranger 21 / Fighter 6 / Barbarian 13.<br><br>Weapon Master is always a good choice, Fighter 8 / Barbarian  25 / Weapon Master 7, or Fighter 6 / Barbarian 6 / Weapon Master 28, variants...

Ah, finally. Application accepted. I was the one who brought this idea up to Cinna Bar.<br><br> The idea behind this build is meant to be RP based. The Weapon/Armor/Class Restrictions clash badly. The thing I am most intested in is to see if there is any PvM or PvP potential in this unorthadox combination of restrictions.<br><br>Another thing is I am also tempted to see if there is maybe some chance for a sneak devver in this kind of combination.<br><br>I haven't played NwN for very long, now. So I still have a rather limited amount of knowlege to what does and doesn't go well together. Especially when faced with this kind of problem.<br><br>So, here is the final piece of the puzzle:<br><br>This is meant to be an RP heavy build, but trapped in a server that is rampant with power builds. I don't want him to 'reign supreme', per say. I simply want him to be able to put up a good fight and survive. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">

The biggest problem with this build is that you need both strength and dexterity. <br>You need strength to improve the Attack Bonus with the spear. You also need a dexterity of 28 to get the same Armor Class with clothes as a normal fighter gets in full plate. <br><br>Your Barbarian lvls will give you Uncanny Dodge to help you with your dex based AC.<br>If you get enough dex items to max dex to the cap (+12), you still need dex 16 from the build itself to get there (dex 28).<br><br>Taking a class that let you max out tumble will also help with the AC problem. HIPS can also be a defensive asset in a build that lacks plain AC, especially if you have stealth-skill boosting items.<br><br>If you can take both great dex and great strength as bonus epic feats, that will help. A combo with fighter and assassin can give you extra feats so you can take great strength as standard epic feats and great dexterity as bonus assassin epic feats, and still have room for the most essential feats a melee character needs.<br><br>Another way to get higher stats is to use a bard lvl to gain access to the RDD class and its huge strength bonus. But I guess that is out of the question here. (A low charisma bard would not be able to cast spells though) <br><br>A build with high dex and str is ideal for throwing weapons. But I don't know if that is allowed in this build.<br><br>Another option is to neglect dex and rather go for constitution and strength. You take lot of barbarian lvls to get barbarian damage reduction plus the epic damage reduction feats. High hitpoints and damage reduction somewhere between 13/- and 19/- will be important to your defense. Rage will add to hitpoints and will last longer with a high constitution. The AC will drop another 2 points, but then again as a barbarian you wear your scars with pride! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 02/05/08 14:07</span></i></p>

With the availability of +10 gear and that extra +2 from Ioun stones, I'd say go for BBN/Rogue/FTR Something on the order of BBN 5/Rogue 29/FTR 6. Go DEX-based to get Epic Dodge and maybe even look at SC V. You can augment your damage with STR gear, but your AB is really going to suffer (and you have lots of sneak attack damage).<br><br>Conversely, go STR-based and boost your DEX to 28 with items, as suggested by Mick.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Alright, well. I do so happen to have the 'Pretty Good Character Creator' module. Let me run a few tests, and then just maybe... you might see my very first build on the Epic Character Builders boards. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

This is my favorite build that I've made Rogue17/Fighter6/Barbarian17. It is a Dwarf so you will have to rearrange a few things when going Human. Just thought it might give you some ideas.

And I know the server he is made for has not only +6 strength belts to round out the full +12, but also +10 Dex Belts and even Lesser Ioun Stones that grant +2 to Dex as well to give a full +12 to that stat. So, effectively... he'll have a 42 Strength and a 28 Dex. Giving another +3 to AB and +6 to AC. Not to mention, with using a twohanded weapon like the spear, when I did some smacks on the Combat Dummy he did a total of 446 Damage within 8 hits at an average of 55 damage a hit with a mundane spear.<br><br>Now, the reason I left Rogue levels for Post Epic was because I really wanted to pump up this guy's AB. If he's going to be hit a lot, he better be hitting right back. But in doing so, I think I lost my chance at Terrifying Rage.

I think it would be worth the loss of 1 AB to take 4 Rogue levels pre-epic. Having tumble (plus all the other Rogue skills) will help a little with your AC problems. Terrifying Rage, as you mentioned, is also nice to have. Especially when you can chase people around and sneak attack them. You would have to drop a couple Great STR feats to accomplish that though. That would lose another AB. Or, you could go heavy Barbarian to get a bonus feat and have to drop Fighter levels which would lose several feats. It just depends what is worth more to you. Good build.

Yeah. As said, this was made in a character creator. I didn't level him. But I can imagine taking those Rogue levels post-epic is really going to make this a challenging build. But once he is 40th, he's going to be one of those 'Sure, I'm not the best. I might go down a few times. But if I hit you, you're going to feel it and wish you never met me' builds, even without Dev Critical.
