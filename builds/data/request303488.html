Ok, here are the circumstances:<br>A PW that gives the players all items they need, to upgrade for their own purposes.<br>So you basically can get +5 equip, +12 to one attribute, +12 to a second attribute, and a lil + to a third. You may apply certain runes that cause certain effects to take effect on your items. Main damage at this server comes from Orbs, that apply elemental damage effects on your weaponry, which even goes for ench. arrows, that you can generate 6 Stacks of a day.<br><br>Problem is the monsters are made extremely powerful. So some having about 80 Armor Class or even more. Some others are adjusted to suit certain types of player characters which influences their efficiency greatly, e.g. orcs with epic weapon master on their weapons are no fun at all, since they are able to crit for far more than 150 damage and got at least the 4 attacks and are hasted.<br>At some areas it is required to have blocker characters in your party, that are just being created for the sake to hold off the enemy attackers, requiring them to drop offense to zero.<br>The hitpoints are greatly increased too, so no fun for Wizards or Sorcerers that should actually be damage focused characters. They remain buff bots at this server, unfortunately at least for the most time of the game towards their 40th level.<br>Characters that do very well are basicaly fighting oriented cleric builds. Buffing themselves up healing themselves achieving ABs higher than the majority of weapon master builds.<br>Yet I wasn't able to climb further than Level 30 since I just didn't hit monsters anymore.<br>Was playing a good ole' Fi10/Ro2/WM28 Build so far, suits my role playing needs the best. (I somewhat enjoy playing military focused characters, at the current it is a former leader of an infantery squad)<br><br>I'm getting kinda pissed, cause this character build worked on every pw so far, it dominates the oc + exp anyway. Builds that achieved 40 so far were:<br>Bard/Fig/Rdd, Cle38/Mon (Zen Archer), various Cleric heavy Cle/Fig Builds, almost anything Dex Based that can achieve higher AC ranks above the average 61, my WM Build would go with in the end. Dual Wielding is out of question, since it's not affordable to drop down AB and AC at the same time, so even a sneak attacker would go for 1 Kukri and Shield.<br><br>That's it, I'm done, you probably with me. Any suggestions so far? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif"> <br>Wished there was a possibility to create a good build that's able to hold itself alone.<br><br>I would be willing to drop down my need for meat and steel. And overcome it for celestial gain, or even arcane, if your ideas foresee some of these classes. Anyway, spot on for the "epic character builders" <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">

Cleric26/bard4/RDD10?  High AB, for a cleric.  All the cleric buffs.<br><br>bard26/BG4/RDD10?  All that bardic goodness, plus Divine Might and Divine Shield?  You can still focus on STR, and just take CHA up to 18, and with +12 gear, pull out another +10 in damage and AC.<br><br>Just a couple of the more monsterish builds.

The bard heavy Disciple won't be even close to do it solo, his AB will be too low, and he'll be missing DCs on his offensive spells, although he'd made up an insanely capable buffer, but not much more than this, someone tried to build a jack of all trades? Thanks for the suggestion.<br>I was well aware of RDD builds showing up. But still I can't sympathize with Dragon Disciples for RP reasons. It's just too rare, and there are allready so many running about at this PW. Anything besides of RDD / Cleric Combinations? (I know they will work at this PW <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  )

Well, I have to admit, you don't see everyday people asking for help and bashing mods on how their good building is crap.<br><br>I'd think twice before misjudging FinneousPJ's suggestions, he's a great builder, while a Bard 26 / Blackguard 4 / Red Dragon Discipline is far from my favorite build, it is indeed a very nice melee for solo, maybe you've never played a buffer like Clerics, Bards and Druids, but those kind of builds work neatly as meleers since their regular combat stats are compensated with their abilities, it's a nice change to the Bard/Fighter/RDD you claim not want to play. Granted, a Weapon Master will always have higher AB (not higher DEV crit DC, that goes for the RDD man), but we are not here to give the same build every single time, it was you who asked for variety.<br><br>150 critical damage sounds pretty heavy for regular enemies, assuming it's X2 is quite powerful, I won't deny that, so probably a Dwarven Defender won't make the cut, so my usual suggestion goes to hell. Weapons sounds quite strong, so leveling up a shifter style might be hard, though once reaching dragon shape your AC will be good enough, 61 is a joke for a dragon... amazing and rare isn't something you're going to find easily, since you can increase 2 stats to max, I would be willing to try a Blackguard / Bard / Arcane Archer with Divine Might, it won't have a lot of defense but use items to boost up STR (assuming high Mighty bows, or else don't do it) and CHA and it will deal nice amounts of damage with obviously high AB. I can't guarantee it will work though, depends mostly on the size of the mobs, if they are too large you won't be able to avoid getting badly hit and die, but AA builds usually work pretty well.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 11/27/08 01:07</span></i></p>

I don't like where the discussion is leading. Don't get me wrong, I do appreciate all of your suggestions. Still this is a forum, it is there to discuss and exchange different opinions. I do think this is what I did, while pointing out that I dislike a certain suggestion. If my choice of words was too harsh, I only can ask for you to understand, that using a foreign language will remain a hard thing, once it is about to hit the right temper.<br><br>I won't comment on the Banshee any further as it doesn't seem to make any sense. I tried the build and it failed. And to foreclose any further 'constructive' comments: It's because of the engine not because of me.<br><br>Thank you, Thax, your AA build is innovative and should do.<br><br>Maybe I should ask, what is probably the highest AB / AC build that you can get. Would adding up AC and AB Points make sense to be able to compare different builds? (e.g. You got 65 AB 61 AC the total score'd be 126)<br>Would it be a Zen Arching Cleric with two Monk Levels? (72 AB 77 AC buffed up, maybe more possible, didn't play around too much with spells, but it would score 149, which actually should be higher than a halforc WMs 126)

I don't believe adding AB and AC to make any sense, you can't compare builds like a 70 AB / 50 AC with a 40 AB / 80 AC, both sum up 120, but they are so different there's no direct comparison. You can compare your AB vs your enemy AC and your AC vs your enemy AB separately.<br><br>The highest AB build is a totally useless piece of junk that hits everything and deals or resists nothing, likewise, the highest AC build won't hit a bug and won't kill it if by luck he rolls 20. Also, the magical level of your equipment affects a lots. So for practical uses, I consider the highest ABs and Acs in the order of the 80s, that much is awesome enough IMO.<br><br>I haven't made the spread, I assumed you could do it yourself <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  but it might end something about Bard 8 / Blackguard 5 / AA 27, I haven't calculated what is your minimum Bard level on such a build, but I think you'd like it low on Bard and high on AA, take only BG as high as to take Divine Might and Bull's Strength.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
