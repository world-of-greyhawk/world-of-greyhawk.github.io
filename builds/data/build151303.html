This is a variation on my Infernal Thug build.  The point was to make a dex-based version of the build so that you don't suffer from armor check penalties.  You lose Dev. Crit. and Crippling Strike, but you gain Epic Dodge as well as 9th lvl spells.  You do have to be a little careful on the lvl progression so that you don't get an XP penalty.  At lvl 20 you should be Rogue 4/Fighter 4/Cleric 12, and in Epic lvls just make sure to keep Rogue and Fighter within 1 lvl of each other and you will have no  problem.  <br><br>Rogue 13/Fighter 8/Cleric 19<br><br>Race: Dwarf<br><br>Domains: War <br>         Trickery<br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 10 <br>Dex 16<br>Con 14<br>Int 14 <br>Wis 15<br>Cha 8<br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 28<br>Con 14<br>Int 14 <br>Wis 19<br>Cha 8<br><br><br>You put 4 points into Wis and 6 points into Dex.<br><br>You get 10 feats pre-epic with this build.

I think this build would work very well as a halfling as well. Also which do you recomend of the two versions with no exp penalty.

Halfling would work, BUT there are a couple of disadvantages.  Although you would get higher AB, you suffer a penalty using IKD, and you are easier to knock down as well.  In addition, you're AC would be lower since you can't wear a shield in the off-hand, due to the fact that Halflings wield Rapiers as two-handed weapons.  <br><br>Also note that since Halflings get Rogue as their favored class, if you didn't want an XP penalty you would have to either keep Fighter and Cleric within one level of each other, OR take CoT rather than Fighter, and lose Epic Weapon Spec.  <br><br>As for the version with no XP penalty, I would say probably the Rogue 17/Fighter 8/Cleric 15 version.  Although you can get 9th lvl spells with the other version, you only get 1 per day at lvl 17, so it's not a great loss.  For the loss of one 8th lvl spell and one 9th lvl spell per day, you gain 1d6 sneak attacks, Crippling Strike, and +2 Con.    <br><br>You could go 16/8/16 instead; you would lose 1d6 sneak attacks from the 17/8/15 version, but gain one 8th lvl spell per day (Mass Heal or Greater Sanc).
