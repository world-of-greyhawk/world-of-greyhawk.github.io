I admit I don't really get the level split, mainly due to the Champion and Cleric parts.  Why not just go something like Cleric 20/Paladin 2/Champion 18?<br><br>As it stands, you're losing 7 paladin spells for those 5 cleric levels and the cleric spells last for a fairly short duration.

Yeah, it is hard to see how much you gain from those 5 Cleric levels. If you're going to level up this guy, I'd think the Holy sword would be nicer than low Cleric buffs but that's just a guess, I've never gone full Paladin to be sure. <br><br>You also get the smiting part quite late. In fact, for such a high Charisma build, perhaps Extra Smiting should be taken earlier, I'm not a fan of the Initiative stuff, so I'd delay that one.<br><br>It's good overall. I don't like that low unbuffed AB, but I think at least you'll get a decent amount of Divine Favors to last several fights without resting.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 01/04/10 07:22</span></i></p>

You made a concept build of pal/cot with high Charisma.  What you have done is sacrifice AB for saves (vs a high str build).

In this case 20/20 would be much better (as magi says).  Just cuz you can take 3 classes, doesnt mean you must.  <br><br>If you are gonna rework this gal, look at taking more great smite feats to put the smite damage over the edge.

Mhe, the top "fit the purpose" is not a bad idea, the problem is purpose can vary a lot. For example, I made a build intended to have the highest Stunning Fist DC without a crappy AB. The DC ended at 63 with an AB over 45, so it's top because it made up to its purpose, but it was not so perfect, since after criticism, I remade the build to get buffed AB of 62 with a SF DC of 54. The second one is far better for PvP, but the first one had the highest DC, which was the initial purpose. You'll never reach consensus of which one is the best, and it was just one build there. <br><br>From my playing experience, I value playability much more than end stats. My builds usually have the purpose of growing strong from low levels even if there's another combination that yields better stats at level 40. But there's no way to actually weight playability vs end stats, and playability depends too much on experience and style to make fair comparisons.<br><br>The way I saw the good builds was like this: I thought of a combination I thought was godly, so I searched and found it had been done already. So check which of those was the best. My building spread usually was most similar to Kail's, so there was no need for me to post a build spread he already did. Anyway, when you see the same builders already did all the good builds you wanted to post, you start to figure out they're good, and when you read on their criticism stuff like "kudos", "great build", "I wish I thought of it before you", you know it's a good build. As far as I know, if you want power check Mithdradates's builds. You want good builds overall? You can make a good initial bet with any of the people marked as moderators: Cinnabar Din, Kail Pendragon, FinneousPJ, Grimnir77, grizzled_dwarflord, they're all are excellent builders. Bromium is practically an exclusive shifter builder, he's the authority of th shifter class on the guild as far as I know, they're damn well made, but they're all shifters. griphook is a guy who was not present at the guild when I joined, so I have no idea about him. You can check my builds if you have spare time, some are good, some are weird, some are just concept trash.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Continuing with the Award Ceremony example, you might have categories like Best -Assassin, Melee Fighter, Ranged Fighter, Evoker, Shifter, etc. Or if those are too general you can be as specific as you like. Once the categories are chosen, you pick the build or even top 5 or 10 builds that excel the most towards that end. So your high SF DC Monk build could be under the category of "Most effective SF" (with the high AB adding to that effectiveness), which could be under the more general category of say "One Trick Ponies" or "Quirky Builds".<br><br>The criteria for builds that are not primarily casters could have rankings based on how many abilities or spells, buffs need to be activated for the intended purpose to be achieved (the lesser being better). Casters can be measured by Spell DC and how hard it is to dispel them. In general, a list of criteria relevant to the build purpose can be compiled to make a sort of customised "Challenge Rating".<br><br>As you said, general playability would be very difficult to measure and compare, especially if you try to break it down to how playable a build is on a level-by-level basis. It's not only subject to varying playstyles, but also dependant on the environment it is played in. So, I don't think that should even be attempted.<br><br>In the end, it all has to come down to whether or not the build can do what it was designed to in any playstyle at all (doesn't matter how, as long as it can and to a high degree), and in any environment or possibly the environment it was designed for if specified.<br><br>It might be a big and very meticulous task, but I believe that theoretically, it can be done if the will exists to do it.<br>_________________<br>-"Well then I rest my case."<br>-"Where?"<br>-"Over there." *points to suitcases on the ground*<br>-"...I know when I'm beaten."<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Angelis Dania on 01/08/10 02:54</span></i></p>

Now that we have taken this post WAAYY off topic (by the OP LOL!!).<br><br>Forget for a moment, this game is about 8 years old (i think i bought it in 2002).  That the peak building year was around 2006.  That 1.69 made some of the builds "illegal" as they were done.  Forget that it has NOTHING to do with the class splits, the feats, the gear, but has EVERYTHING to do with the player.  Forget that no 2 people can agree on how to classify a build with PRC (is this build a Pal or COT?  Pal cuz thats the base class.  SOme say COT cuz there is more lvls.  BUT what is PURE COT??  Not what is shown here).  <br><br>So if you want to invest the THOUSANDS of hours to go through EVERY build and play it in EVERY way possible (i can play the same cleric build 4 different ways depending on mood and gear) then clasify them to what category?<br><br>While the idea is a great one (and, if i recall, it was discussed in 2006 with pulse and the others that were here), the logistics for an old game i just couldnt justify asking ANYONE, let alone pulse, who i havent seen in about 3 years (yes, i played a few games with him iirc).

For example, a character designed to have the highest possible AB should be categorised as just that type of build - "Highest possible <i>something</i>".<br><br>Now let's say then that there are 5 people on the panel of judges for example. If 3 out of 5 say that the build is:<br><br>1) Interesting or relevant enough to include.<br>2) Achieves the designers purpose to a high degree.<br><br>then you flag it and move on.<br><br>As for some builds being rendered illegal by patches, a simple proviso would suffice.

Very few builds fail to meet what their builders designed.  The ones that come to mind are ones where the builder doesnt know skill dumpin, class skills, min/maxing.  The problem is, that us old guys and gals cant recall who did what when, and more importantly dont really care to remember! (look at the monk no monk thing you built and read what Finn says.  That is how we all do it.)  <br><br>There is no such thing as the uberst build.  TO do what you want, go for it!  You will be wasting your time as PLAY STYLE is the only thing that matters.  I know, people dont want to believe it, but it is the truth.  I have seen so many mess up so many good builds in game it made me sick (even mine, which i was pretty sure was idiot proof.  turns out, there are alot of non-cleric players out there).  The build in the hands of a good player is irrelevant.  WHat i am trying to say is, it ISNT the character sheet that plays the game.  It is the player.  But good luck.

You are also right about it being difficult if not impossible to quantify. That is why, if anything were to be done at all, only the comparison of character stats would be anywhere near viable.<br><br>But as you also said, and I agreed, there are other factors that would make such a venture impractical.

I can't believe that someone else had this idea.  I am working on the same build, but I am doing it with a Halfling instead of Human.  By the time that character is finished, it should be 15th level Paladin/15th level Cleric/10th Level Champion of Torm.  I'm doing it that way because level 40 is supposed to be the cap.  I'm currently running this character through the OC and plan to take him through the HotU when I'm done with OC.
