From what I understand, the sorcerer has many severe drawbacks.  A whole slew of builds have come out to offset these penalties, but few of them really effectively deal with HP without wasting points on CON or getting 9 levels of healling domain cleric to get heal at the expense of sor. caster levels and CHA.  That changed with the introduction of "draconic vigor", healing you relative to the level of the spell you were casting.  Though certainly not going to heal you in a hurry or sustain you sufficiantly in close combat, it can add a lot to longevity when in battle.  This plus the concepts behind other builds, like "exaulted sorceress", I give you THE UNYIELDING SORCERER!  In truth, the idea isn't all that different from the exaulted sorceress, get levels of paladin to take advantage of divine grace and a quick class to get tumble maxed for a cheap +8 to AC, but it is enhanced with a lot of features the PRC adds.  I am adding a rough template of what I'm thinking about.

it would be nice if there actually was a build here to help you with.<br><br>The only thing PRC would add to this build is epic spells.  Now, in prc, epic spells like ward and ema become dispellable (in my experience).  They are termed lv 10 spells.   <br><br>The unfortunate thing is, there are few if any of us who play prc anymore.  getting help here can be hard.  The other thing with prc is that the servers that implement them usually modify it for their own circumstances (when i played, we used 2.2 right up til 1.69 nwn patch).  <br><br>In my opinion, prc is a more advanced building ground.  If you decide to go this route, you will be largely on your own and MAYBE get help from the PW's forums if they have it.  <br><br>Oh, my advice to you is, IF you are going to use PRC, use PRC!  Sorc pal rog has been done to death.  There are many other cool things like Ooozemaster you could look at, or even rwot (i had a sorc with necro dc in the 50's iirc with that class).  <br><br>Prc is all about avoiding vanilla rules.  I played with so many who did what you are doing and they never really got what prc can offer.<br><br>enough from me.  Sorry i have no other help

But if you want to be strict about this, you could swap out the paladin levels with soldier of light if you want to delay divine grace to level 12.  Or, I could just replace all sorcerer levels with warmage, so no defence for schorched-earth-going-to-hell-offence.  How ever, from what I understand, warmage dosn't get epic levels.  Maybe I should try a melee build first and take advantage of the fast healing line of feats.<br>_________________<br>PC:  That couldn't have been good<br><br>Tomi: I'd say, sleeping naked in hay can leave you picking hay out of your... oh! you're probably talking about the coming-to-kill-me thing<br><br>P.S.

k, let me put it another way.  Would you ask an infant for driving lessons?  <br><br>Because PW's use PRC in their own way (its big enough for that to be done.. before 1.69 came we used 2.2 for a LONG time!) so HOW can you expect any help if we have never played the pw?  You cant.  Now, please understand, most people here arnt interested in PRC.  I think it has only been me and Anuis who have posted builds in the last 3 years.  Lots of help!!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>You will find more help on the PW's forums.  At least they have played the areas.  Otherwise the best advice is to make a sorc/lich!!  For crazy DC i did a sorc18/wiz1/rwot21 with insane DC.
