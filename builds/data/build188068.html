Well, as a fellow witch-character maker ( <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "174943", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> ), I like the idea behind the build. And what I love is that both our characters, created with the same basic idea, can be very different builds!<br><br>I like mine better, of course because I made it, but yours has a nice flair. It is much more defensive with the palemaster levels. The palemaster gives a nice evil edge, but the connection to undead is, in my mind, a little wierd for a druid. Even an evil witch, if nature based, should have some respect for life, and a natural dislike for the undead. But for practical reasons it is wonderful. <br><br>I only have two problems with the build. The first is that the ending wisdom is 29 (unbuffed), which doesn't give the best spell saves. And with only 20 druid levels, your animal companion isn't the most kick-butt creature you get. This leaves damage potential kinda low, but the extra defense makes up for it.<br><br>The second is the undead arm. I mean, what a temptation for your companion! How do you think you will be able to cast spells if your animal friends are hanging off your bone arm?

Thanks!  Yeah, the low saves are rather bothersome, hence the maxed out Spell Penetration feats; I suppose it shall just have to be more of a PvM build than a PvP one.<br><br>And I usually hide the arm underneath a robe of some sort <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">
