<b>Playable from level 1-40...PvM or PvP</b><br><br>I figured I would complete the triumvirate of spellswords with this entry.  It's pretty tough, the 38 AB is kind of low, but it buffs up to 46 and with a taunt it's effectively a 52.  It manages a fair AC with plus 5 equipment, and has pretty good hitpoints.  As a spell caster it's pretty strong too.  It has full wizard spell casting, with enough levels and spell penetration to get past item based SR.  It is also pretty much immune to any dispells other than a Mordenkainen's Disjunction or Holy Sword.  I manages to have epic warding.  The spell foci in evocation were chosen to give it chance to do extra damage against strength based melee builds, and it can help with spells like fire brand and chain-lightning.  This build should do best in low to mid-magic settings where devastating critical is banned.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br>-Level 9 wizard spells.  He has enough levels to avoid being dispelled by anything other than a Mordenkainen's Disjunction or Holy Sword.  With spell penetration he can also bypass item based spell resistance.<br>-Epic Warding. Coupled with the damage shield spells, his enemies will take more damage than he does while pounding on him.<br>-Okay AC.  It isn't spectacular but a 60 AC with +5 equipment is better than average for an armor wearer.  He can also cast bigby's interposing hand and use expertise to raise it higher.<br>-Good taunt skill.  A 50 taunt should be as higher than an opponents Concentration barring a epic skill focus in that skill, so he should be able to lower an opponents AC.<br>-Good damage per hit.  He averages 38 points of damage a hit with just mundane equipment and buffs.<br>-Good Hitpoints for a spellsword.  He has over 400 hitpoints.<br>-Maxed out UMD.<br><br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br>-Low Base Saves.  Thanks to the dwarfs +2 bonus to spell saves and a high spellcraft he has okay saves vs. spells.  His base reflex and will saves are horrible.  He can use mind blank to help the will save, but the reflex save is just bad.  <br>-Low AB.  A 38 is okay for a spellsword, but kind of low for a melee build.  He does have taunt and a couple of buffs to help out.  If all else fails, he can always cast true strike.<br>-XP penalty at level 39. Not really a problem but it should be mentioned.<br>-Low Spell DCs.  There are plenty of spells that can be cast without DCs.<br><br><b>Weave Warrior</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Dwarf<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Any non lawful<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 16<br>DEX 8<br>CON 18<br>INT 16<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 6<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>Levels 4 and 8 increase intelligence<br>Levels 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36 and 40 increase strength<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Bard 1<br>Fighter 13<br>Wizard 26<br><br><i>Level Distribution and Feats</i><br>Level 1: (Fighter 1): Toughness, Weapon Focus (Scimitar)<br>Level 2: (Fighter 2): Knockdown<br>Level 3: (Illusionist 1): Lightning Reflexes<br>Level 4: (Fighter 3)<br>Level 5: (Fighter 4): Weapon Specialization (Scimitar)<br>Level 6: (Illusionist 2): Still Spell<br>Level 7: (Fighter 5)<br>Level 8: (Fighter 6): Blind-Fight<br>Level 9: (Illusionist 3): Spell Penetration<br>Level 10: (Fighter 7)<br>Level 11: (Fighter 8 ): Improved Knockdown<br>Level 12: (Illusionist 4): Greater Spell Penetration<br>Level 13: (Illusionist 5): Extend Spell<br>Level 14: (Fighter 9)<br>Level 15: (Illusionist 6): Maximize Spell<br>Level 16: (Fighter 10): Improved Critical (Scimitar)<br>Level 17: (Illusionist 7)<br>Level 18: (Fighter 11): Improved Initiative<br>Level 19: (Illusionist 8 )<br>Level 20: (Fighter 12): Expertise<br>Level 21: (Illusionist 9): Epic Weapon Focus (Scimitar)<br>Level 22: (Illusionist 10): Great Intelligence I<br>Level 23: (Illusionist 11)<br>Level 24: (Illusionist 12): Epic Prowess<br>Level 25: (Illusionist 13)<br>Level 26: (Illusionist 14)<br>Level 27: (Illusionist 15): Great Intelligence II, Great Strength I<br>Level 28: (Illusionist 16)<br>Level 29: (Illusionist 17)<br>Level 30: (Fighter 13): Epic Weapon Specialization (Scimitar)<br>Level 31: (Illusionist 18)<br>Level 32: (Illusionist 19)<br>Level 33: (Illusionist 20): Automatic Still Spell I, Automatic Still Spell II<br>Level 34: (Illusionist 21)<br>Level 35: (Illusionist 22)<br>Level 36: (Illusionist 23): Automatic Still Spell III, Great Strength II<br>Level 37: (Illusionist 24)<br>Level 38: (Illusionist 25)<br>Level 39: (Bard 1): Epic Skill Focus (Taunt)<br>Level 40: (Illusionist 26): Epic Spell (Epic Warding)<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 26<br>DEX 8<br>CON 18<br>INT 20<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 6<br><br><i>AB and Damage</i><br>(no buffs, mundane scimitar)<br>38/33/28/23 14+1D6 (15-20 x2)<br><br>(+5 to strength [Bull's Strength], Greater Magic Weapon, Flame Weapon, Keen Edge, Haste, Scimitar, Bard Song)<br>46/41/36/31/46 22+1D6 (12-20 x2) +1D4+10 (fire)<br><br>(As above with a +12 to Strength)<br>50/45/40/35/50 26+1D6 (12-20 x2) +1D4+10 (fire)<br><br>(As above with true strike)<br>64/59/54/49/64 26+1D6 (12-20 x2) +1D4+10 (fire)<br><br><i>AC</i><br>17 (no buffs, no equipment)<br>28 (full plate, tower shield)<br>46 (+4 to Dexterity, full plate, tower shield, haste, mage armor, shield, shadow shield)<br>60 (+4 to Dexterity, +5 full plate, +5 tower shield, +5 Ring of Protection, +5 Boots of the Sun Soul, Haste, Mage Armor, Shadow Shield)<br>65 (As above in expertise mode)<br><br><i>Final Saves (Vs.

Nice, the Bard level raises your power quite nicely at the end. I'd probably go with Ftr 14/Bard 2/Wizard 24 personally, Bard1 at 21 and Bard2 at 40.

I really like it, it's strong, dunno if the DCs make the cut, but spells are decent anyway and the buffed power is very good too (try Tenser's Transformation).<br><br>As a non-taunting guy (me), because I rarely taunt, if by any chance you give up taunt, you could change it for Great STR and take another GSTR from GINT (net +1 damage and AB at 1 DC loss and minor slots) or Epic Prowess (net +1 damage)... just a thought, although I don't think you will do it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>A question, seriously, why Illusionist with focuses on Evocation? makes no sense to me...

Christian caught the reason for this level distribution right away; to avoid the long XP penalty from taking the second bard level earlier.  <br><br>I realized that this wasn't going to be a huge AB build, and wizards only have greater magic weapon, bull's strength and true strike to buff AB, so I went for a high taunt.  Unless a build has a spell casting class, virtually none of them take concentration so it does work fairly well and it alieviates the AB problem a bit.  Plus, with epic warding and the damage shields up, you aren't exactly suffering when you use it. For the most part, against something you can't hit you can use magic and against something you can't use magic against you can go medieval on his arse.  <br><br>I found the spell focus in evocation helped against strength based melee builds (19 to 20 reflex save vs. spells at level 40).  I suppose it doesn't do that much.  You could drop it for lightning reflexes and improved initiative instead.  Though a +2 to reflex saves helps build about as much as spitting in the desert.<br><br>When I think about it, I think taking lightning reflexes and improved initiative would be better feat choices.  Perhaps one of the mods, would be so kind as to make the change for me.<br><br>I am working on a story for an assassin build I've been working on.  I'm worried it's a bit too dark, it has the protagonist blinding, deafening and muting a defeated opponent.  I'm going to PM it to the mods before I post the build.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 07/24/06 05:22</span></i></p>

Mith: lookin' good! A very nice series you've got! OK, yer point on the AB.... true, low for a warrior but ok with yer IKD; yer an epic wiz afterall, nice startin' point for that (w. IKD <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    &amp; bein' buffable and all (&amp; you've IKD <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    ) Lots of great spells to choose from, nice assortment of skills, and some neat other tricks incl. bard versatility (bard, yeppers...er., not gonna say it....must not say it...sorry, ... can't seems to help it: BARD TOYS! Doh! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">    I saids it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">   <br><br>As to tauntin', yeah, it's a great skill to have, especially against the big tough melee guys; most out there will focus on their disc., but true enough, not their concentration and esp. not in a dev crit environments (&amp; ain't it grand <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  So, taunt works here, a nice choice for you; obviously, against those who train concentration, taunt don't work so good <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">    However, in light of the odds of meleers skilling in concentration (most simply don't), takin' taunt over one AB point, esp. when you're a spellsword and can buff anyway, seems to makes sense; also, fits the concept of what to me looks like a "warlock" (ie, the taunting type ) -- a well rounded build, and me likes it! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>Nice, Mith (but hey, where's that great story of yours to go with this build?!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    ~ Tyr<br><br>ps. that assassin comin' up...sounds delightful! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/24/06 21:36</span></i></p>

Deborah, you overestimate IKD. You mean Knockdown, type: improved right? With a lowish AB IKD ain't really that good, it lowers an already low AB and it is easier to resist. It might be good vs caster types, that's about it. You write as if IKD is the solution for an already low AB, it is not, it just makes it worse. <br><br>Oh, and how can IKD compensate for 1 less spell pr level?<br> You got me confused, girl, but then again girls sometimes have that effect on me.... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"><br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Grim: <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">   <br><br>Me point on IKD, this being an epic caster, was just that, poifect against caster types (to the extent that melee warriors without arcane abilities don't tend to skill in concentration to avoid taunt (yet focus in disc to avoid a knock), the reverse is generally true of casters so far as they train concentration (hence, resist taunt) but not disc to avoid ie a knock, so that even with this character's unbuffed AB, IKD should work nicely against a caster, and give him a chance vs. melee warriors (of course, gots to land a hit first, and where all those nice buffs come in <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Having both taunt and IKD, plus buffs, the Weave should be okay me thinks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br>As to the school specialization, I was rambling on perhaps, but me wonders why a wiz would do this. One of the things I like about Wiz class is that they have so much diversity in terms of spells, as compared to ie sorcerers. Spealization gets ya one extra spell/level in your chosen school, which is nice, but the cost is that the opposite school so to speak is entirely prohibited, such that (if I understand it right), there's no casting anything from the prohibited school, not even from a scroll, and once you choose to specialize (thus cut yerself off from the opposite school), there's no going back. Just wanting to make sure I understand the rules right, and also musing if it was worth it, that's all. I mean, sure, if there's nothing at all of interest in the prohibited school, then I can see where 1 extra spell from the school you really want might obviously be a good thing; otherwise, since there's no better DC or anything notwithstanding the specialization, only the extra spell per se . . . <br><br>(just bein' curious that's all; either way, and again, me likes this build, yet was thinking that being a "generalist" might work out here too, no? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/25/06 15:43</span></i></p>

Any spell. Does not have to be an illusion one. You miss out on enchantment spells, which most people don't use anyhow, so that's why they go illusion school. They feel it comes almost without cost. And do not underestimate the extra oomph from having an extra spell each level in a spell-blade, especially since auto still always comes in late. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  Grim out.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 03/06/06 18:56:45 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br>Trollborn Asgardian by the master of the Norse legends, Grimnir himself!<br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->
