The reason why you didn't find such a mix is that there is little value in having 7+ levels of SD and 9+levels of Monk in the same build.  The whole point in taking 10SD is to get Improved Evasion, which further opens up Epic Dodge and SC.  However, since Monk9 gets Improved Evasion, there seems little reason to take more than 5 levels of SD (to get Defensive Roll) in any build that has 9+ levels of Monk.  This is why you'll see dozens of Monk9/SD5/ClassX builds, as those 14 levels provide a character with a lot of tricks.<br><br>This now has profound implications on your build.  You havenow just given yourself an extra 5 levels to play with.<br><br>You can now go Fighter8/Monk8/SD4 in pre-epic.  Much better, much faster.  The whole build has just accelerated by 150%.  This also means that you can drop the Knockdown feat you took in pre-epic, and acquire something more useful.<br><br>You can take Monk9 at Level21, SD5, at 22, then continue with pretty much everything you else did.  We can't change when you get Epic Dodge unless we change your starting Dex.  <br><br>But now you'll hit Monk17, which means that you can fight fairly decent unarmed, and if you can find a way to sneak in 1 more Monk level for Empty Body, you're set.  Squeezing in 3 would be ideal, because then you would have that +1AC and the Mind Immunity thing.  But it would mean pushing some Fighter levels into Epic and lowering your AB by one.  But since this character doesn't have innate any significant innate concealment or UMD, it is still worth considering.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I would take the fighter levels pre-epic as much as I could, he problem is that you would be losing SD bonuses for more levels, but if you place more fighter levels pre-epic your AB will increase a little.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Lots of HP for when you do get hit</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Your HP is high but not so amazingly as to brag about it, but I'm not so sure about your AC, you will lose DEX bonus if you wear a heavy armor, even with a leather armor, since the max DEX bonus is +8, you do have +8, but any extra equipment that increases DEX wouldn't give you AC...... so I don't know what you're planning to use as an armor, your AC won't go much higher..... I suppose you would use a Monk armor to keep the kama cheese, the DEX goes infinitely then, but you're still not going so high. you would get near that with less DEX a heavy armor, if you use STR instead of DEX your damage will increase too, since Weapon Finesse can give AB, but not damage, not enough feats as to go for dev crit, but damage much increased. I hope I'm not missing something in which DEX is primordial.<br><br>I also agree that 5 Shadowdancer levels might be enough, but I wouldn't go too much Monk, less unarmed monk, if your WIS is not high, when you get Improved Evasion Monk already works good. I think more Fighter levels pre-epic, for more AB and feats.

ED, EDR III, 648 HPs and good AC are gonna keep you alive for a long while. What this build is lacking is dmg output and UMD mainly, although HiPS will save your day more often than not. I've got a similar build with Rogue instead of SD and less fighter (since I was not going for EDR) and the sneak attacks and/or UMD do help <b>a lot</b>. <br><br>A nice build, you just have to get some good kamas with elemental dmg. If you want concealment you have to give up EDR and some FTR lvls and aim for Monk 18. So the question is, do you prefer EDR or concealment?<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

The revised build looks quite nice.  I'm glad you didn't give up on this concept.  I don't think damage will be such a horrible problem thanks to your epic specialization, but damage is always a relative weakness for dex characters.<br><br>In that vein, 600+ hitpoints and EDR 3 are both fine, fine additions to a dex character.  Even without concealment you should be able to outlast many tough opponents.  Rearranging the level split for empty body (say 19 monk 5 SD 16 fighter?) will cost you a lot of bonus feats but might be worth it in a more defense-oriented build, such as one designed for party tanking.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Well, I'd say it's better now, me liking it, going Monk can also work, and Empty Body is sure a good idea, but I think that going for Self Concealment would be a totally different build, and should be made in a different topic.
