Fun build, and probably deserving a Halfling of Doooom label <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>I'd take crippling strike... giving your opponent big penalties to AB and damage is always a good thing.<br><br>Actually on the kama route, I think you'd get the same number of attacks by wielding a single kama as you would two daggers, no?<br><br>Your BAB is high enough that you'd have 6 base attacks on the monk schedule with a kama or unarmed, the same as with two daggers, but without a -2 dual wielder penalty.  Then you could flurry for a 7th attack with the -2 penalty you were originally accepting as a dualwielder.  Another advantage is that your AB would only drop by 3 for extra attacks (ie, 40/37/34/31/28/25).<br><br>However... you'd have to mess with your levelling order to do it.  But I'd think it's something to consider <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

A fun build, and a good Halfling sneaker. They truly excel at this. You link Grizz's Rogue Tiger. It has a few advantages over this, and a few disadvantages, different enough to easily post this.<br><br>As for attacks dagger vs Kama.<br><br>Attacks with dagger, not hasted, highest to lowest.<br>38/38/33/33/28/23. crit range double the Kama.<br>Then Kama, in Flurry<br>38/38/35/32/29/26/23<br>Difference with using Kama in favour of Daggers<br>0/0/+2/-1/+1/+3/+23<br><br>Not really a big difference. You can use shield, and then dagger would win out easy when needing the shield. Hard to hit opponents without shield, kama would win easy when not flurrying.<br><br>Kama is Slashing, and dagger piercing, keep that in mind to. The kama path should be considered, it isn't half bad.<br><br>As for ISA, I would trade them all for slippery mind and crippling as you yourself noted, and the other two for Great DEX.<br><br>Since you don't have SC feats, I think shield is viable to use in many circumstances, that is why I would use daggers.

Can a halfling still use a kama as a finesse weapon?  Doesn't it have to be a tiny weapon for a halfling to finesse it?  I've specifically avoided halfling monk builds for that very reason.  I'd hate to think I missed out on that +1 AB/AC!
