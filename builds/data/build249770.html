I've often thought of trying to create a character that's decent at both melee and ranged attacks. Most of my attempts turned out poor to just plain awful. Then I began considering the fact that AA gets +1 to AB and damage at every odd AA level, which got me thinking you may not really <i>need</i> to go the DEX route as seems the logical choice. So I figured why not go with STR? That way, you can wear plate, not have to worry about losing a bucketload of AC if you don't have Uncanny Dodge (and many AA builds don't), and you still get good damage from both your ranged and melee attacks. The AA levels serve to boost your ranged attack in much the same manner that adding extra STR does to your melee attacks. This is what I came up with, and I think it's pretty decent for its intended goals. This is the original version, and I also have a Bard version as well: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "249771", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Bladed Archer, version 2</a><br><br>FTR 12/WIZ 10/AA 18<br><br>Playable from level 1 to 40, PvM.<br><br>Elf, any alignment<br><br>STR: 16 (30)<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 14 (16)<br>INT: 14 (16)<br>WIS: 8<br>CHA: 8<br><br>1 )FTR1: WF:Longbow/ WF:Scimitar<br>2 )FTR2: Blind Fight<br>3 )FTR3: PBS<br>4 )WIZ1: STR (17)<br>5 )WIZ2<br>6 )FTR4: WS:Longbow/ WS:Scimitar<br>7 )WIZ3<br>8 )WIZ4: STR (18)<br>9 )AA1: Rapid Shot<br>10)AA2<br>11)AA3<br>12)AA4: Called Shot/ STR (19)<br>13)AA5<br>14)FTR5<br>15)FTR6: Toughness/Knockdown<br>16)AA6: STR (20)<br>17)AA7<br>18)AA8: Still Spell<br>19)AA9<br>20)AA10: STR (21)<br>   <br>21)FTR7: GRT STR I (22)<br>22)FTR8: EWF:Scimitar<br>23)WIZ5: GRT INT I (15)<br>24)AA11: GRT CON I (15)/ CON (16)<br>25)WIZ6<br>26)AA12<br>27)AA13: GRT STR II (23)<br>28)AA14: EWF:Longbow/ STR (24)<br>29)FTR9<br>30)FTR10: EWS:Scimitar/ EWS:Longbow<br>31)WIZ7<br>32)WIZ8: STR (25)<br>33)WIZ9: GRT STR III (26)<br>34)AA15<br>35)AA16<br>36)AA17: GRT STR IV (27)/ STR (28)<br>37)AA18: Epic Prowess<br>38)FTR11<br>39)WIZ10: GRT STR V (29)/ GRT INT II (16)<br>40)FTR12: Armor Skin/ STR (30)<br><br>BAB: +28<br>AB with mundane melee weapon: +42<br>AB with mundane longbow: +42<br><br>AC in mundane plate (with tower shield): 25 (28)<br><br>HPs: 484<br><br>Saves (vs spells):<br>Fort: 26 (35)<br>Refl: 22 (31)<br>Will: 18 (27)<br><br>Skills (209 points):<br>Discipline: 43 (53)<br>Spellcraft: 42 (45)<br>Tumble: 20<br>Listen: 40 (39)<br>Heal*: 43<br>1 point left.<br>*Or whatever you like.<br><br>So, an Elf with decent HPs (imagine that!), some spells to buff himself and his weapon, good AB and damage from both the ranged and melee weapons, and some interesting options to use in each encounter.

Heh, same melee and ranged AB, that AA really makes you AB go high, so high DEX isn't all that much needed, with a high mighty bow this build can be one of the biggest damage dealing on ranged. <br><br>Creative.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 08/14/06 03:39</span></i></p>

Nicely done.  Neither the melee or ranged AB are stellar, but they are good.  This is one of the better melee/ranged builds I've seen.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
