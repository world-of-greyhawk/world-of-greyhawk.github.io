Nice enough start, but a few things:<br>1)you will need to multiclass or you will find your spell progression stunted from low wisdom.<br>2)odd #'d ability scores usually end up odd numbered at the end of the build, leaving you on the edge of a better bonus.<br>3)what domains? This will decide a lot of how you play<br>4)where is he going buildwise? what do you want to end with, a mighty buffing battlecleric or a spell flinging caster?

I completely forgot about the Cleic domains. One of them would have to be healing, because that will be very useful for a party, as for the other one... what do you suggest? <br> I would prefer to have spellcasting cleric instead of a fighting type though.

The 13 intelligence is good only if you need expertise, which isnt necessary for a pure cleric build, unless you are a caster.  I would also try to get str to 13 at lv 1 so you can take pwr attack and cleave (leave out gr cleave cuz its not necessary unless you are goin for dev crit).   Take these 2 feats at lv 1.  Then, take wpn prof: exotic at lv 3 for the katana.   <br><br>Since you are going to cleric 40, the only metamagic feat to take would be max spell (unless you are goin for a melee build too, then extended is VERY useful). <br><br>My advice, like i said before, decide HOW you want your character to end up now (at lv 1), so that you will not be disappointed later.<br><br>Peace

definitely, raise your STR to 13 or 14, you want power attack so that you can get divine might and divine shield (you seem to be going high wisdom and charisma from your stats.)  For a caster cleric, divine shield can be very useful.  Also you can drop your DEX to 10 and the put the extra point somewhere else.  For domains you might find air (chain lightning), death (extra death magic and the avatar), plant (creeping doom) or magic useful.  If you are going for a caster cleric, I wouldn't use a katana, I'd stick to a simple weapon.  You don't need waste a feat on a weapon you'll hardly use.  With your high wisdom, I'd take zen archery and focus in a ranged weapon.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 07/04/05 04:09</span></i></p>
