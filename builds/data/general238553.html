Does anyone have any advice for me concerning a server change?  I am tired of my server, and would like to find a new one. I would like to find a server that is realy story based with loads of RPs and a good atmosphere to it.  Also what is this I hear about some servers being connected?  Does that mean you can take your chars from one server to another.  If so, wow thats cool!
