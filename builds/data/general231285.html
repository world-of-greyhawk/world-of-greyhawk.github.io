What items are prefferable for Exalted Sorc?<br>I have max charisma from items...<br>What is the priority of bumping next? I assume Con then DEX for AC and then STR for extra lbs carry... And if so, what next? INT WIS?<br><br>Thanks.

If you can max CHA you'll be fine, everything else is just extra <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">   . Well I suppose next is CON, DEX, WILL and then INT. Oh yeah, if you need to carry stuff then do STR <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 02/21/06 20:47</span></i></p>

Con and Str. Dex is useless if you are wearing heavy armor as she is designed to do (you can max the dex bonus with Cat's Grace). Str is nice for carrying capacity, especially if she is wearing heavy armor. After that, probably Wis for the Will Save bonus. Int is pretty much useless for her.<br><br>TM

DEX boosts Reflex save which is a nice save to boost when you have Evasion...<br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm

With a 3 from the Cat's Grace, he already has +6 to Dex, and a reflex save of 37. I wouldn't make further dex-boosting items a high priority. Fine if he has them, but not critical to the build by a long shot. If he's wearing heavy armor and a tower shield, he is going to be tight on carrying capacity so I would probably put Str-boosting as a higher priority.<br><br>TM
