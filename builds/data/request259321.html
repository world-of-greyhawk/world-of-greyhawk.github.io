Vahn, I think the best build you could get on the server you play on (which I happen to come from <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  ) would be the Ftr/Wm/Rogue build, which happens to be very cheesy and unliked by myself.<br><br>Since you don't want over 13 bard lvls, that limits your AC numbers unless you were a dexxer, but you wanted dev. crits.  Also, paladins get medium-ish AC for a dev critter via divine shield, but you'd wind up with low dev crit DC and low AB. <br><br>So, that leaves me with going 10 RDD lvls.  Buuuttt...I happen to know you wouldn't want more then 8 RDD lvls, so I'm blank on ideas, besides the boring 12 Ftr 25 WM 3 rogue (or similar variations).<br><br>But, luckily for you, I'm not the epic builder here, I'm sure someone can come up with something good for you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Reply to Finn and to anyone that also wishes to know. I'd consider maybe 50-70 the amount of AC wished for this build and for Dev Crit? Whatever you consider good/high.<br><br>As i said, i'm not a very good builder :'( which is ashame heh heh.<br><br>Also, mantis brought up a good point, being that he's a good friend on one of the servers i play on <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  so yes 10RDD or more is also out of the question im afraid <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  sorry to be so awkward. I know how you guys like a challenge<br><br><br>**EDIT** As for damage, i'd say maybe a crit damage in the hundreds would be delightful

Fighter/Bard/Palemaster is a fine build in a dev-crit world.

Argh, in my haste and new'ness to this it seems i am missing out all the vital information needed to be aided in the design of a character. Apologies on that front my friends.

That means 90% of builds will have no problem reaching the 50 AC you specified.

I'm surprised nobody asked if this was a PvP or PvM build focus.

It's mostly PvM environment, however considering the faction this characters going to be committed to he'll be involved in a small/medium part of PvP.
