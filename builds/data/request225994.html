Im thinking of doing a pally/monk build<br><br>I have two ideas so far and they both have a few things in common: 15 lvls of pally, at least 20 lvls of monk, duel wield kamas.<br><br>as for a third class 2 comes to my mind. <br><br>SD - E-dodge, but gains less AB/AC, because of the lack of feats.<br><br>FTR - Better dmg, ab, ac, and more feats. Lacks e-dodge. It also makes me shift pally into lvl 16, because I only need 4 lvls of ftr when turning epic.<br><br>Any comments would be appreciated. One thing for sure is that i would like to hear about the use of divine might in the build. Oh and of course race for that matter.<br>_________________<br>Be realistic...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kalmar_Oxin on 01/04/06 14:08</span></i></p>

A quick search with pulse caps search engine revealed 20 paladin/monk builds. 3 of them had 20 or more monk levels, and 11 of them had 15 or more paladin levels. None of them had both.<br>There were 2 builds with SD, and only 1 build with fighter but 5 with CoT!. There were 2 "pure" builds with no 3rd class.<br><br>(One of the SD builds is mine, a stealthy smiter with high Cha, but base Str, Dex and Wis. It's a build I won't recommend unless you want something veeeery unorthodox.)<br><br>If you go Monk 20/Paladin15/xxx5, a SD dex build will allow epic dodge. A fighter build will allow weapon spec. and give 3 bonus combat feats.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

Well Mich this is more like a discussion on what would be better. I have the builds already, I just wanted to hear what people think would be the best of the two.<br>_________________<br>Be realistic...
