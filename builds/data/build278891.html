Hmm, since you're only going 1 Rogue, I'd consider taking a Monk level instead - that would net 2 AC (potentially +8 with enough WIS gear), and would give you the option of going kama over kukri.  Basically, trading the crit. range for the APR.<br><br>Or, if you're set on UMD - you definitely should go 3rd Rogue for Uncanny Dodge, since you're a DEXer.

Yeah, Uncanny Dodge is quite important, if you're leveling the build playing it for real it would be of use to take Uncanny earlier than level 38, UMD is also very useful for playability, concerning potential losses sometimes losing a feat is not important compared to be stronger sooner and make the build easier to play.<br><br>Also, I'd take Divine Might a lot sooner, you need damage sources as a dexer or you won't get to level 39.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

I would rather have UMD than the extra APR, and monk's wis AC bonus would be the same to not as good as a tower shield. Paladin spellcraft unfortunately doesn't really give access to any good enough scrolls to drop rogue and UMD for me. Taking monk would do more justice to the name, with faster attacks, but for the server I play on I would rather not have a character that doesn't have UMD or some useful spellcraft. <br><br>Monk would definitely be better if you do not particularly need UMD or don't want to go for uncanny dodge, but I'll stick with my rogue-ness.

Yes, Rogue over Monk, but even so, this boy needs some Uncanny Dodge, or he's no Mongoose.  Ranger21/Paly15/Rogue3.

Yeah.. it still shouldn't be too hard to level without uncanny dodge until 37-39, with divine shield early on making up for tumble and Keen Senses + spot or listen keeping most meanie HiPSers at bay, just be careful to not be caught prone until then.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By applesaremybestfriends on 07/18/07 05:30</span></i></p>

When playing on PW's where you generally just go PvM, flat-footed isn't a big deal since most of the mobs won't kill you that fast.<br><br>But play in a PvP environment vs. run-shooting monk archers, HiPSing (or CSing) sneaks, and you'll definitely know the difference between having uncanny dodge and not having uncanny dodge. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

Or, if you didn't think you would need maxed tumble and wanted bane you could go 21 ranger/15 pally/3 rogue and just take the 3 rogue levels at 21-23.. you'd lose 3 AC from tumble, but it should be worth it if Uncanny is so important. Both of these routes would lead you to a much more painful xp penalty a lot earlier than it would be. You could also always do 23 ranger/14 pally/3 rogue,and get some WIS gear for holysword.. you'd lose 1 ab and damage from divine favour, possibly not get divine might, and I think gmw would only be +4, but it's always a thought.<br><br>Yes, HP is a problem..

If you didn't want Bane of Enemies... then you can take out Ranger altogether for something better dude. Not taking Bane of Enemies on a Ranger is like having loot in front of you and not taking it.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Neat build. <br><br>A dex-version of Finn's, Mith's or me Wildwood gang's Lionheart (26 ranger/15 paladin, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "276571", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> but, yeah, he's also str. based! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      <br><br>Love the concept of dual-wield pally (as you can see)   but must question the efficacy of ranger here ... at least, as a dexer w. only 4 FEs (and b/f you say you've access to lots of magic, well then, so does everyone else then, right? so, won't do you much good).<br><br>Apples, the idea is to build w.o thinking about oh what goodies can magic gear give me (since, as noted, it's avail. to all your enemies, too - as in, whatever you can get, so can they, hence, no further ahead than where you started right?); that said, if your intent is to build a support character, that you've done ... but I'm thinking you want more, yes? <br><br>OK, w. that in mind ... (and don't take it the wrong way, just trying to help, which is what I assume you're here for, at least if you wanna have any shot whatsoever pvp (or to solo pvm). Not trying to be mean, I'm not; but you really need to ask how useful *really* as a dexer is taking bane against only 4 enemies (w. totally dispellable pally buffs, no uncanny, low saves, no KD, no Blind Fight, and hence, no damage .. AND so few HPs? Oh yeah, and no ED either (what, half-orcs, gnomes, half-elves are banned on your world? Dude, you're missing about half the races, not to mention, regardless of race, what any WM worth his/her salt, any arcanist w. bullrush/mord's/IGMS, a bard who is gonna taunt/sing/curse, a sneaker, a smiter, all mongoose slicers. <br><br>OR, Odin help you, Badlands you say? Saw a build here, a focussed disarmer -- might even have been a half-elf; but does it really matter? As a mongoose (cool name btw), wld really like to see you take out the snakes <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br>Seems to me you're spreading yourself way too thin, and hence need to focus -- do you want to be a ranger w. some pally support? in which case, take ranger to 26 (2 more fes), rogue to 3 as suggested (that's great advice, Apples), BF instead of extend (you need BF, too) and forget about the divines (yes, they're sexy, but that cha you're relying on to make it work, dispellable, ... and no good anyway if you're KD'd/bullrushed, right? <br>Yes, Holy Sword is sexy too, but when you've only one helping on one kukri for such a short duration per day, one must question it's efficacy, right? <br><br>then again, if you love pally, if your goal is a dex-based, dual wield pally, w. a litte extra 'oomph' then, better off going 26 Paladin/6 Ftr/8 Rogue (goin' human, far better skills and more feats, more damage (WS/EWS, and 4d6 sneak), more HPs, more AB actually than what you've got (as in, 45 naked, bring it up w. undisp. pally buffs), blind fight, knockdown, better saves, did I mention undispellable buffs, and ... uncanny -- oh, and planned right, no xp burdens either ... <br><br>Either way, there's some great advice here, Apples, and people are only trying to help you better what otherwise is a neat concept. <br><br>That said, welcome to the guild. I'd be happy to help you, if you like (I'm a huge pally and ranger fan, too!). If so, just send me a pm.<br><br>Cheers, Tyr<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/19/07 06:31</span></i></p>

Hehe, thank you for that, Tyr. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>I realise that I'm not near as good as most of the people here, which is why i figured I'd post. [[Bigby's bullrush is disabled on Badlands, along with Divine power, the sanctuaries.. IGMS also only does 1d6 damage each misile, and theres some other stuff I can't really think of right now, just for info.. also, once someone brings a mage into PvP the "war" is usually over, no one wants to just get owned over and over by a Gnome with healkits or a 38wiz Elf with mord's and bigby's grasping and a friend that pickpockets you]] Yes, the lack of the other races as FE's might be a nuisance, but gnomes/half-elves are barely ever picked, on my server at least, and Half-orcs... well I can just hope they won't have as much AC as a halfling or elf. I realised after I made it I would never use it for Dual-wielding, when you're fighting people with 60+ AB 67 or so AC is not good. [[+5 gear, +12 dex/cha]]. When I built this I really was just trying to get Bane, pally buffs, and divine shield... One of my main flaws is when I build a character I only focus on one or two things about it, my best all-around is probably my disarmer as well[[27 ranger/12 monk/1 wiz]]. I always try to get blind-fight because the boss monk gloves on Bads give On-hit: Blindness DC=26 Duration:75%/1round, which also make you go flatfooted when you initially roll the 1 that everyone hates. <br><br>This was also the first build I thought of after about a 8 month break from NWN, so yeah. The +1 STR bonus is better than most my dex builds [[usually -2 or -1 STR mod]], damage is not really a problem or really thought about, and with pally buffs I assumed it would be pretty nice-ish for a dex build, but apparently not. Pretty much all disarmers on Bads are halflings, either ranger/monk/wiz or pally/monk/wiz, the better ones are usually rangers... Pallies get nice AB for longer, but less AC and when truestrike'd usually don't have as good AB as a ranger... Although there has been a strange increase with people using unarmed dwarf 28barb/2bard/10rdd's with terrifying rage to disarm, and if they fail switching to a heavy flail for the +x bonus depending on your weap.. but when your half-orc with ESF:Disc and 82 discipline [[+8 from items, +12 str]] is getting disarmed, it pretty much means unless you're an uber bard and str-based, or str-based and have an uber bard friend, you'll be soon weaponless or eating the floor if the person really wants you to. <br><br>With +12 cha gear the divine shield is helpful enough, ~76 AC will get you KD'ed by a few people, or truestrikers. Then again, that is what the sheet says, and we all know about the sheet's love of lies and trickery. I also wouldn't intend on using holysword unless someone brought a mage, as soon as I used it I would promptly be disarmed [[basically everyone on Bads also believes holysword is too powerful and some completely refuse to use it, no matter what, and spam-disarm/pp/KoS people that use it too much.. They only don't disable it because it's one of the things that make pallies pallies o.o]]<br><br>I seriously appreciate the help, and look forward to posting another build [[hopefully better]] again sometime. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">
