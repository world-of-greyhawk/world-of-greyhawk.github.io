I am willing to build a PRC Playground of sorts if I see that there is intrest in haveing such a thing. Some of the possible things I would include are as follows...<br><br>-Custom Races (Vampires, Wolves, Genasi(s), ect.)<br>-Forge Of Wonders (A Forge that allows you to put any prop. on a item, for a cost)<br>-Custom Items (Some unique customs, meaning ONE and only ONE will exist)<br>-Quests (Some big, some small, working on scripting up a random quest generator)<br>-Player Housing (You must buy it of course)<br>-ILR (Item Level restrictions will be off, In my opinion, if you earn the gold to upgrade your gear you should be able to use em <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  )<br>-And More (Thats all I can think of off the top of me head)<br><br>Let me know what you think, all I would need is a host, and then the games would begin (Once I finish the module of course)
