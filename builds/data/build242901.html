My third contribution to the Epic Builder's Guild, and I have to say...probably my favourite of them all. As you can probably tell, this build's main concept is to be a sneaky Paladin, with Epic Dodge, a very respectable AB, and a lot of versatility. I'll be going over my choices now.<br><br>First of all, the Divine Power/Might Feats. With only 16 Charisma, it might seem like a little bit of a waste. Even with your two Charisma buffs, it's not going to be very much. It's going to take a round to put each of them up, and they're not going to last an extraordinary amount of time. If you wanted to, it's not unimaginable to lower your strength to 12, get Dex instead of strength for your first ability, and replace Divine Might, Divine Power, Power Attack, Great Charisma 1, and Great Charisma 2, and Great Dexterity 1. That's 6 freed up feats to do whatever you want with, 3 of them Epic. Assuming you can get your hands on +12 Charisma items on the server you play on, you'll be trading off 8 Divine Damage and 8 AC. Your choice.<br><br>Second, the god-awful HP. Unfortunately, that's a tradeoff you simply have to live with. If you wanted to take the route mentioned above, you could get Toughness, and some Epic Con feats to make up for your lack of HP. You still won't have amazing HP, but it will -definitely- help. Other than that, I highly suggest Constitution Items. Your Epic Dodge and AC are going to help you not get hit, but that's not going to do jack against Damage Shields and Mages, who are going to take you down -fast-.<br><br>Third, You have some very nice versatility. You can pound on people with your 50 AB Fists, and then switch out to a bow, only losing 3 AB, when a mage comes along. You still do extraordinary damage with your bow (compared to other non-AA's), at 18-26, 10 of it Unresistable.<br><br>Finally, you've got a very nice arsenal of stealth and evasion techniques. You have 48 Hide and Move Silently, HiPS, 130% Speed, and Epic Dodge. So, if you find that you can't kill someone, or simply want to duck away to regroup, running away is perfectly viable. The only thing, unfortunately, that you're missing is 50% concealment. That's one of the only things you're going to have to bum off of a friend.<br><br>Anyway, I hope you've all enjoyed the build. I intend to make it on my server ASAP, as I've fallen completely in love with it.<br><br>As always, I'd appreciate any COMMENTS or CRITIQUING you, the community, can offer! The only way to improve is to have numerous outlets of feedback, and that's you!<br><br><i>*EDIT* added playability range.

As always, these dexers will be a pain to level for quite some time, no matter how powerful at lvl 40. The damage is close to, or actually AT, ridiculous. Not only in the beginning of the career, but even at lvl 40. Epic dodge at lvl 39? Mighty late. I do seriously think you should go with a shortsword and go Pally26/Rogue14. Still epic dodge, WAY earlier, and still skilldump with rogue. You'll get sneak attack and you can use Holysword. (Unless it only works with slashing weapons?)<br><br>Then go Paladin20/CoT6/Rogue14 for 1 extra feat (exotic) and kukri, which is slashing.<br><br><i>*edit* Typo</i><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 03/06/06 18:56:45 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br>Trollborn Asgardian by the master of the Norse legends, Grimnir himself!<br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 06/17/06 11:42</span></i></p>

Holy Sword works on all melee weapons, yeah.<br><br>All-in-all, I'm pretty happy with this build, even if the damage might be a bit low. Epic Dodge comes late, yeah, but at least it comes at all. =P<br><br>I'll PM you what I consider the Playing Range to be. =)

*nods* That's certainly a very viable option.<br><br>Another option, if your server allows you to relevel, is to simply take some of the Monk/SD in the Pre-Epic levels, so that you can get Epic Dodge faster, and then relevel once you hit 40 to get full BAB. My server allows releveling, dunno about others, though.<br><br>And thank you for taking the time to look over and give some recommendations. =)<br><br>&lt;edit&gt;<br><br>Actually, looking at the build, you could take a monk level on the level you get Divine Might, and switch Epic Dodge with Divine Might. That's the soonest you can possibly get ED with this build without impairing the BAB or changing the starting abilities, though.<br><br>&lt;edit again&gt;<br><br>And if you -really- wanted Epic Dodge soon, you could take   one monk level in Pre-Epic (say, at 17, to let you max out tumble a bit earlier) and then switch a Great Charisma Feat with a Great Dexterity. You could take Epic Dodge at level 33 by doing this, or 36 with the other option, as opposed to 39 with the currently-sketched build.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Acothea on 06/05/06 12:25</span></i></p>

Firstly, lvl 39 is not too late to be getting Epic Dodge, however; I am familiar with this kind of build and I can tell you that it would work an awful lot better if you made the following changes:<br><br>1) Drop the Divine Might / Shield feats. This is PvP, you need to really optimise your build and fill the niche that it occupies.<br><br>2) Starting Stats:<br><br>8 Str<br>20 Dex<br>8 Con<br>14 Int<br>14 Wis<br>8 Cha<br><br>I am sure I will be chastised for this, however, these are pretty much standard starting stats for ANY PvP Pal (or Ranger) Monk / SD / Rog / CoT ...basically NON - Cleric Dex Melees<br><br>3) Feats: pre-epic: weapon finesse, weapon focus, skill focus: discipline, blind fight, extend spell, dodge, mobility<br><br>epic: paladin bonus - weapon focus, epic prowess<br>standard - epic dodge, epic skill focus: discipline, epic skill focus: spot, great dexterity I-IV<br><br>All stat increases going to Dexterity -&gt; 34<br><br>levelling, pal 1-20, then rest any mix in between, making sure SD at level 39 &amp; Pal at level 40.<br><br>----<br><br>This has the overall effect of:<br><br>1) AB 46 unbuffed -&gt; 65 with items as you describe<br><br>2) AC 33 naked -&gt; 69 with items as you describe<br><br>3) skills :<br><br>Discipline 43(55)<br>Heal 5(7)<br>Hide 40(52)<br>Move Silently 40(52)<br>Spot 42(56)<br>Tumble 40(52)<br><br><i>EDIT : I would actually drop Hide &amp; Move Silently to more junk levels, giving more to Heal skill or even maxing out Concentration (no-one likes to be Taunted!), however I decided to leave your skill set as similar to your original one as possible!</i><br><br>4) Saving Throws :<br><br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/18/28<br><br>----<br><br>Okay, so there is a Major loss of Fortitude and the saving throws suffer as a result of the lower Charisma, however, you could always replace two Great Dexteriy feats for Armor Skin and Epic Fortitude. This would result in 1 more AC at the cost of 1 AB, with an increase in Fortitude.<br><br>The important part is the increase in AB, no NET change in AC and a GREATLY empowered set of skills. I cannot stress how important Discipline is in PvP. 42 is not going to stand any chance against IKD from a mage, let alone your 70 AB Pal/RDDs.<br><br>I hope all this helps.<br><br><i>EDIT : Elf is indeed the best choice for this build as you gain the ubiquitous PvP feat, Keen Senses. There is nothing worse than having to sit around in detect mode to avoid those pesky sneakers, which disengages when you enter combat.</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By krsboss on 06/17/06 10:36</span></i></p>

if you drop hide /ms you ll be spotted from everyone - makes hips worthless, also you should use kama , hence holysword is an uber spell ^^ and lets u use hips vs casters + 5more dmg from enhance and 1d6 divine. the base dmg only drps from 1to9 to 1to6 which aint bad .<br>but droping div might andshield is a good idea , doesnt last long anyways and you already need to boost dex and wis and some str is handy for dmg since you get nothing to dish out loads of dmg. <br><br>btw what server is that you play on with the relvl option ?

Yes, it is. Antiworld allows you to completely relevel your character at any point. Sorry for the delayed response, I have limited internet access at the moment.<br><br>Thanks for your suggestions, though...and while they're probably better, the Divine Might/Shield was intended to be one of the main foci of the build, so dropping that, for me, would ruin it.
