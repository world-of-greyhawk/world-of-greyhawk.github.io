Alright, this is my first build so be gentle...<br><br>I am a fan of pure builds, and a fan of the humble Fighter. Together with the Wizard, the Fighter is the base build in D&amp;D from which all others come - everything else is just a specialised variant of either of these two. <br><br>While a pure Fighter is undoubtedly weaker than when he is multi-classed with Weapon Master or Champion of Torm, he remains as probably the most versatile class there is with a whopping 36 Feats to distribute. With this in mind, there has to be a clear idea behind a Fighter before you even begin or you will end up with feats all over the place and just taking Epic Toughness in Epic Levels.<br><br>First up, there is the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "229118", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Me Big Man</a> build, which is focussed on Devestating Critical and ends up with Epic Toughness X.<br><br>Then there is the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225021", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>You Want to Fight, Fight Me!</a> build which tries tomake the most use of the 36 feats by specialising in multiple weapons. <br><br>Neither of these builds, in my opinion, make the best use of a Fighter's abilities.<br><br>The idea for the Pure Bastard, and his cousin the Overwhelming Bastard, is to make a Fighter that specialises in only one weapon and uses all of his remaining feats to increase his flexibility in combat by raising his Saves and his combat choices. Basically he's a Mercenary that was too undisciplined to become a Weapon Master and too unruly to become a Champion of Torm. I also wanted to avoid going the Dev. Crit. (though I ended up making a Dev. Crit. version anyway) and Epic Toughness routes.<br><br>I've actually been playing around with this build on paper and in Character Builder Modules for a few weeks, but only started playing with the Spreadsheet in the last few days. I think that this version is a little different to the one I tested, but not much.<br><br>So, here he is:<br><br>Pure Bastard<br>Fighter(40), <br>Human<br>	<br>STR: 15 (23)<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 16

A few suggestions:<br><br>- Remove spring attack since you will have Tumble to overcome the AoO when moving in combat.<br>- take IKD WAY earlier in life.<br>- take your combat AB and Damage Epic feats before your save boosters.  EWF/Prowess/EWS in that order.<br>- after those, focus on EDR.<br>- if you need to burn some bonus fighter feats doing so, take E-Toughness<br>- fort is more important than will for a fighter (dev crit protection) so take Epic Fort before Epic Will.<br><br>- you will also NEED Epic Skill Focus Discipline or your build will end up on it's rump more often than not.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 07/05/07 01:15</span></i></p>

I wasn't very clear with my other post.<br><br>EDR was originally taken at levels 36, 38 &amp; 40. Some skills suffered in their placement because of this. IKD was one of these.<br><br>I don't use KD by itself, once my opponent is on their back I spam CS to lower their stats before they get up again, so I have to take CS before IKD. While there's some flexibility in the pre-Epic feat order there is much less in Epic. Combine that with all the moving of EDR, and IKD got left behind at a level when I wouldn't normally take it... that's what happens when you're fooling around with a spreadsheet at 4 am.<br>_________________<br>Pointing at the large hole in Richard's chest.<br>Gid: "What happened to you?"<br>Richard: "I wanted to lose some baby weight, caused by the baby I ate."<br><br><a href="http://www.lfgcomic.com/page/1" target="_blank">LFG</a>

Intersting idea.  Many moons ago, a most lovely build (imho) was done using a dwarf, fighter8/pal2/defender.  I thought it was masterful!  He had full ab and ALL the save feats.  Had edr and defender dr!  Had a ton of con, so a TON of hps.   At the end of the day, this build wasnt as widely accepted as i had thought.  See, the trouble with this build is, 23 str!  Its a shame, you wont hit much with that!  too bad really!  Well, it could be worse!  You could have left it at 16!! LOL or whatever the start str was!<br><br>With ALL those fighter feats and lv 38 IKD!  THis should be stickied!  I have done, and I know others who have had no choice but to take pre feats in epic.  Sometimes you have no choice (ex, a dex weapon master NON fighter!  Very tough to fit all feats in pre), but with a full fighter  there is no excuse.  You DO NOT need mob and spring and dodge!  Your argument is moot.  I have a char at lv 18 who EASILY avoids AOE in full plate with cross class tumble.  At 23, very rare to get picked off.  THis is the difference between PLAYING the build and just lvling the build.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/28/06 00:22:49 (GMT) -- TyrTemplar<br><br>This post is for general information purposes only, and does not constitute a legal opinion or render any legal advice.

If, as you say, you're specializing in one weapon, at least take Overwhelming Critical. Even if Dev is disabled, you still gain a healthy amount of damage whenever you score a critical hit. It just seems worth it to increase your damage and strength a bit, since losing 40-80 HP from that massive pool is no real harm.
