This build isn't anything special, and has been done in similar forms before, but here is my take on it. I went for high AC and AB, 2 epic spells, as well as saves around 30 each, +8 against spells, of course.<br>The biggest problem is that you get stuck with 13 discipline from level 10 to level 40, which can make things hard if you actually have to level the build up. My suggestion here would be to drop 2 aa in favor of bard levels at 22 and 32, where you can get 25 tumble/disc/umd and 35 tumble/disc/umd, respectively.<br>Another variation might be to drop two of the dex feats and greater ruin, pump Con by 6 and dex by four, and grab epic DR III. You’d get 9/- DR on top of your crit immunity, and also gain 120 hp. You’d lose 4 ac and 4 ab. Up to you. I think the AC is probably more valuable than the DR and HP.<br><br>Alignment: Non-good, non-lawful<br>Starting Stats:<br>10 str<br>17 dex<br>14 con<br>14 int<br>12 cha<br><br>Pre-epic: 3 bard 6 pm 1 bard 10 aa<br>Post-epic: 4 pm 9 aa 6 pm 1 bard<br><br>Feats:<br>1 pt blnk shot<br>3 wf: longbow<br>6 toughness<br>9 rapid shot<br>12 imp crit: lb<br>15 great fort<br>18 iron will<br>Post-epic:<br>21 EWF: Longbow<br>24 Armor Skin<br>27 Epic Fortitude<br>30 Epic Will<br>33 Great Dex<br>36 Great Dex<br>39 Epic Spell: Greater Ruin<br>Palemaster:<br>1 Epic Energy Resistance: Fire<br>2 Epic Spell: Mage Armor<br>AArcher:<br>1 Great Dex<br>2 Epic Prowess<br><br>Skills:<br>43 disc<br>40 tumble<br>40 spellcraft<br>43 UMD<br>9 Perform<br>51 leftover.

Im currently playing a very similar build on my PW, the one thing I would change with the one above is Epic Spell Mage Armour, probably to hellball, since the spell duration for EMA won't be very long with relatively few base caster levels.

Ok, maybe it's because my game haven't been updated ever (On the computer I usually test my characters), but I can't get the epic spells to work. I get to choose them, but not to use them. Do you guys know if this has been improved on an update, because if not, it's entirely useless...

Celestial, they don't show up in your regular spellbook. Try right-clicking, going to spells, then finding "epic spells" on the radial menu. If not, I have no idea.<br>And mike, as far as I know, epic spell: mage armor has no time limit. It's epic spell: epic warding that has a 1 round/level limit, and therefore barely lasts two seconds if you don't have a lot of caster levels.<br>At least, I've never had epic spell: mage armor run out on me, and I've played builds with 3 bard/16 pm, so only 3 caster levels.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

yrtsns, in the above example, would Epic Warding really only last 3 rounds, or would it last 16 rounds since that is your PM level?  I'm not sure, since PM technically doesn't effect your caster level in base NWN, although it does give you more spells per day.  <br><br>As for the Epic Mage Armor thing, I believe it's supposed to last either 1 turn/level or 1 hour per level (1 hour is 2 turns).  I'd be somewhat surprised if there was no time limit, as there is a time limit for every other spell in the game, but I suppose that it could be the case.

I'm not 100% sure, because I don't use epic warding. Epic mage armor doesn't list any time limit... I think it works like an ioun stone (it looks just like one, you'll notice). If it does have a time limit, then perhaps it does use the PM level, and probably works in hours, so that it would be 32 minutes. But my guess is it is in fact based on the bard level (i'll have to check by making a test character with epic warding), and that epic mage armor works as an ioun stone, which is why it has no listed time limit.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

I have tested this build (Well, I modified it a little) on the server I play, and it works great. The epic mage armour... well, I still haven't seen that the duration of the epic mage armour expire, although epic warding last for very little time. Great work, great build!

Wisdom stays at base, that's why it isn't listed.<br>I'm not sure what you mean by the "higher ab version." Do you mean perhaps 4 bard 10 pm 26 AA? In that case it would have 4 higher mundane AB (take great dex feats at AA 22 and AA 26) for 54 AB. But it would lose 8 AC (-4 PM -5 Mage armor +1 dex).<br>The AB of the build I suggested is listed above as 50 mundane.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

The original version is the version as posted, and all points go into dex, so he ends up with 30 dex when you toss in the 3 great dex feats.
