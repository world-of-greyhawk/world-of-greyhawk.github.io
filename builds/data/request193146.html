Seems the PRC does not use the 3.5 rules for the Bard going after the manual (gets only 4 skill ponits, no spellcasting failure in light armor is not mentioned).

I've been trying to make this build. I ended up with Bard(10), Shadowdancer(10) pre-Epic, and Bard(11), Shadowdancer(19), Palemaster(10) as final build. Syrath, how did your Bard(12), Shadowdancer(8) develop after level 20?<br><br>I started with an Elf, stats Str 10,Dex 18,Con 12,Wis  8,Int 14,Cha 14, and boosting Dex all the way (ending at 32), for Epic Dodge and Self-Concealment V.<br>Pre-Epic feats are ofcourse Dodge, Mobility and Weapon Finesse, but what about the other feats? Can I just pick anything, such as Luck of Heroes, Spring Attack, Toughness, Curse Song or whatever? Or are there special feats that would be recommended for this build?<br>Skill-wise I ended up with maxed Hide, Move Silently, Tumble, Discipline, Spellcraft(41), Perform(18), Lore(10), and Use Magic Device(35), so that's pretty nice.<br><br>By the way Mick Dagger, I don't think Epic Pale Masters can take Epic Warding!?!<br>_________________<br>Don't take life too serious.

Epic palemasters at lvl15 can take all the epic spells; provided they fulfill the spellcraft requirments.

I guess the otherwise so reliable NWN Grimoire is wrong here... according to the Grimoire, PMs can have Dragon Knight, Greater Ruin, Hellball and Mummy Dust, but not Epic Mage Armor or Epic Warding.

The concept was called "The AC Queen", I went with minimal bard levels (5 or 6 IIRC) and both epic PM and SD, I think I ended up with an AC of 50ish naked (might be more, but I cant remember exactly at the moment).  The main problem I found was that even using weapon finesse the AB and damage output were, to be honest pittiful and the hit points were pretty awful as well.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By M1ke47 on 05/06/05 17:59</span></i></p>
