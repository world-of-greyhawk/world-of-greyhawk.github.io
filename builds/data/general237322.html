Hi.<br><br>I play on a mid magic type of pvp server, with +5 ac (mid 90's ac is possible if I calculated it right) items and weapon enchantments from +5 to +6 depending on how common they are in builds and +7 for other weapons that either require exotic proficency or are 2 handed weapons. <br><br>The weapons are fairly standard like kamas which go up to +5, and most other weapons have +6 version also and tend to do between 30-50 on hit damage, some resistable others not. <br><br>Can get about +10 listen and spot through an item, +20 listen with amplify scrolls though it only lasts a round +10 listen/spot with clairaudience/clairvoyance which lasts for 3 rounds.<br><br>The usual trend is to get spellcraft to 35-40 for high saves and epic warding, and +10 to saves through basic items so anything that relies on crits, mind spells, death magic, and probably just about any type of magic at all other than possibly the likes of web/entangle and hope the player is too ***y to run away before rolling a 1, though the pvp areas are usually quite open for running.<br><br>Anyone who is a good enough builder to make the 21/3/16 correctly is likely good enough to make it as a neutral so smiting is out.<br><br>Heal kits are never in shortage and are always cheap, combined with the great amount of monk levels...<br><br>I'm stumped.

So, what exactly is your point? You want a build that can take them out, is that it? Well, for a foe that has 90 AC, a caster is your best bet.

Yes, they seem to be almost invincible by those sets of rules.

Forgot to mention that timestop has been nerfed to last about 4-6 seconds tops, IGMS has a reflex save, and maximise spell does not seem to work with any of the mages damage spells. A bit sad that they've been so badly butchered, they needed to be nerfed but I think they went overboard on the mage <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">

That's too bad but frankly, anything that requires you to make an attack roll against those fellows is worthless <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"><br>_________________<br>"And one calculates <i>time</i> from the <i>dies nefastus</i> on which this fatality arose – from the <i>first</i> day of Christianity! – <i>Why not rather from its last?</i> – <i>From today?</i> – Revaluation of all values!"

Even if IGMS has a save and you can't maximize it (can you at least empower it?), a Sorcerer 1 / Monk 1 / Paladin 1, like said earlier, focused on evocation for power spells and all should do the trick, and a simple Epic Warding to resist those guys, how are CON boosting items on your server? that could affect somehow.<br><br>Their SR should be easy to beat, since a level 21 Monk has an SR of 31 or a bit more if they took Improved SR feat, which is rather unlikely. That SR cannot be boosted or decreased, so you can breach it easily with a 38 Wizard/Sorcerer with Spell Penetration feats.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 04/15/06 18:28</span></i></p>

I hesitate to suggest it since it sounds like most spells are nerfed, but a high AC build like that has a weakness when flatfooted.  A cleric with good AB may be able to harm them back to the stoneage after a WoF...or hit them with something pointy even.

Arcane archer would have the juice to hit em well enough, other than that, you'd need a buffed cleric or CoT with enough charisma and enough levels to sustain a good divine wrath attack to do phisical damage. I just made a bard vartiant with lots of use magic device and plenty of tumble.
