Really nothing in the guild like this, and only one build using these classes ( Avado’s <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "193180", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Evil Spell Smasher (Monk 32 / Cleric 1 / BG 7)</a> , which is itself strange since these 3 classes have a bit of synergy together.  <br><br>This fellow is little more than a typical melee caster cleric, but majors heavily in the crossbow.  Admittedly not the best ranged weapon, it does have the best crit range of those in the game.  The challenge in making a crossbow specialist is to not only have a good AB, but to be able to do something with that AB once you get it.  I’ve built this a number of ways, and could never settle on any one because they all seemed to lack something.  I had fun toying with a Dev Critting crossbow, but the problem with that is that in going for Dev Crit, the AB tends to suffer.  A Halfling had some success in going the strength and dex path and was able to grab both Dev Crit and Epic Dodge, but it was a late bloomer.  What’s nice about this build is that it’s a nice steady increase of power from start to finish, and has a number of different ways to confront an opponent.  <br><br>While not a powerful cleric, his 32 levels are enough to garner respect, and he enjoys the flexibility of using melee weapons or the xbow, or in using heavy armors or no armors.  He has a variety of tricks in his arsenal and I found the Domains of War and Trickery slightly edged out the domains of Strength and Travel.  War gives him a steady Cats Grace which he can Empower for added AC, as well as a decent use of Battle Mastery, and Trickery grants the ever useful Improved Invisibiility.  <br><br>He can deliver a variety of damage types to opponents, to include Divine and Magical, and can do so accurately from long range. Divine Power allows him to make his 4th attack at Full BAB, so he can nail targets pretty consistenly from downrange.  Unlike an Arcane Archer, this projectilist could have issues with some DR since he will be limited, to some extent, on the quality of bolts available in your environment.  <br><br>Divine Shield was the original feat choice for Level 3, but I felt that Point Blank Shot server a better purpose in this build and that his AC would take care of itself.  One can still take that and drop one of those feats, but it’s a tough call.<br><br>Note:  As a variation for those who have compatibility issues with Monk and the Trickery Domain, one could drop Monk altogether and pick up Fighter for added weapon feats and damage.  Cleric29/BG3/Ftr8 had a higher damage output, but lacked a bit on Defense and AC.<br><br><br><i>Corrected starting STR/INT - Kail Pendragon</i><br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 06/04/08 17:47</span></i></p>

The lack of Spellfocus is what I put my finger on first.

In the version I played with, I started with a 14 Strength and 10 Int, and afterwards thought, "I really don't need all that strength and I'd rather have more skill points."  However, I now realize there was a reason why I had a 14 Strength, and that was because of the Power Attack prereq.  The way I have it above isn't possible.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
