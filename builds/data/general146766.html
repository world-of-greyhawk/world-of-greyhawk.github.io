I don't know if this is suggested before, but here it is anyway <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .<br><br>How about making a (or using an existing) module in which people of this guild can have their builds battle eachother to see which one is stronger. <br><br>I've seen quite some remarks like "my build will kick your build's *** anytime", if we were to have a place which is always available for such duels, we could have a fight organized between the two including some spectators also from this guild. Perhaps even have announcement of when a next fight will be taking place etc.<br><br>So in short:<br>- have a module made (or find one that fits this purpose)<br>- have it run on a server which is available all the time (if possible)<br>- have a thread to announce duels, so people may come and watch<br><br><br>I don't know if anyone is willing to build and maintain something like this for the guild (I don't have the time nor the experience for it), but I think it would be fun to have <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

There is already a server running for this exact purpose. Unfortunetly there is never anyone on it.  If you wanted to set up some sort of tourney just talk to Anuis and get things organized.

Currently the module that is on the server is bugged... however, I have new version of it, but it is PrC version. If no one wants the PrC version, I will have to do major overhaul of the old one and fix everything in it.<br><br>I would be able to get good idea of which one is wanted if people would speak up instead of lurking around in the forums....<br><br>anuis

Maybe there should be something like a fight club where at a certain time every week, people who want can log on and just test builds like Dom is suggesting. That might help get people there to participate with others.

If you make one, you need to areas. A monster arean and a player arena. No special weapons, just regular weapons and no potions or enchanted items. The server should be there to test out builts.<br>_________________<br>Which Stick are you?<br><a href="http://www.ihateyour.com/cgi-bin/bbs/YaBB.cgi?action=games;game=Stuntexperience" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

I agree with Tyr. All the dueling servers you see out there all consist of fighter/monk/wm builds because the items become so uber. There should just be typical items. Maybe have +5 be the max. This way if people are on the same level of ground when it comes to items then it will show who's character can truly perform.

There are exception to those that has ability to enchant their own weapons... such as wizards, arcane archers, and so on. They might have advantage over some...<br><br>Anuis

I don't mind a no magic item arena as one of the choices. I have my master of scare tactics build that can beat a mithral golem with no magic, and two normal daggers.

There has to be some sort of magical equipment. Let's face it, there is no server out there that has no magical equipment. Heck even in the original single player mode you have access to magical equipment.<br><br>For example lets look at a universal item that you will find in every server out there. A haste item. Without this item there are some chars that can cast haste and this gives other chars without that spell a disadvantage. But on the other hand this is not testing the chars fairly because most people aren't going to build their chars and use them in their servers without this important item.<br><br>Basically a character might not perform so well against another character that can buff themselves but in a real life situation they would do fine. There has to be some middle ground.

There can be seperate arena for that... one with magical equipment and one without.<br><br>Anyone that leaves arena with the magical equipment will be stripped of anything that is enchanted and given normal items of that same type of equipment that they had on their person. This is doable.<br><br>One may have advantage in non-magical arena, but some might not have advantage in magical arena. So I think that would balance thing out... I hope.<br><br>Anuis

<i>There has to be some sort of magical equipment.</i><br><br>...Epic Build are suppose to work without magical equipment unless the class can enchanted them or buff themselves. Getting access to magical equipment does not prove your Epic build is badass...it just means your build is not an Epic build.<br><br>Plus, if we just add regular weapons we can get this arena up by tonight.<br><br><i>Basically a character might not perform so well against another character that can buff themselves but in a real life situation they would do fine.

I was thinking of just basic items only too, only weapons, armor and a shield. No potions, no magic stuff,<br>so the builds would have to rely on their own skills. <br><br>On the otherhand, some builds are perhaps built under the assumption they would get haste or +5 weapons (to bypass some damage reduction, fighters probably really need it) or something like that, so maybe it should be possible to take some of those items if both players agree.<br><br><br>Btw, I think we would need to pick more then just one time, we have people from all over the world, which will not all be able to get online at the same time.
