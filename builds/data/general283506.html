Hey guys.<br><br>I have a question about what Dispel and Breech (and thusly what Mords (lv 9 spell)) actually means!<br><br>WE often talk about undispellable lv 26!  What exactly does this mean?  Does this protect from breeches?  <br><br>I ask cuz I have a lv 31 cleric (caster lv 31) who has been loosin buffs and such.  I am just wondering how we determine this, and if undispellable really means that!<br><br>There is MORE to it, but I will leave it at that for now.<br><br>Thanks for any help

To sum up (and a correction):<br><br>You're undispellable at caster level 25, actually. This refers only to the actual Dispel line of spells though, and that's what we mean when we say the character cannot be dispelled. <br><br>Mord's is uncapped, so there's no real defense against it.<br><br>There's no defense against Breach effects: they work regardless of your level, SR, or any spells you have active.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

k, thanks for that!  <br><br>Here is the "fun" question now, and it may be out of our area of expertise.  I play on a server that uses the PRC addition.

These spells probably create a magical effect and thus are indistinguishable from normal spells. Some servers particularly aim to make epic spells subject to dispelling.

Yeha  thats what I thought too, about the way they are added.   The thing is though the dm staff and the server owner swear that they want the epics to remain undispellable!   Anyone know how this could be done?

Slightly off-topic, but I have heard Mord's dispells at a lesser percentage when casted as an AoE instead of on a single target.  Is this true?

I would assume that people are thinking this because it only breaches 2 spells as an AoE, so it needs to dispel all other 'breachable' spells or they remain up. With more spells needing to be dispelled in order to take them down, the failure rate will be higher.<br><br>Avado: no idea if that can be done.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
