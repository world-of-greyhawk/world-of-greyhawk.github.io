Hey this is my first build post, but I think I learned a little from the months of trolling the boards reading advice from the likes of Mithdradates, Grizzled Dwarflord, Cinnabar Din, Pulse Cap, etc.  That being said, any and all comments on how to make this guy better are greatly appreciated.<br><br>This build is for my specific PM where various auras are common on mobs, and dev crit is a must.

Thanks for sharing this build with the community.  I built something similar awhile back, a monk19/Wiz5/PM16, and I wasn't happy enough with it to post it.  My frustration stemmed from his poor pre-epic performance.  The AB was so-so, and I found myself hungrily wanting to take Wizard in pre-epic just so he could have a way to buff.  The problem with that is you lower your AB even more.  What happens with a strength-based Monk in the first 10 levels is that they get hit quite often.<br><br>Time is the great equalizer, however, and he does come into his own in Epic.  One just needs to be patient until then.<br><br>If only there was a way to get a 14Dex at start-up.  You could always start with a 15Str, drop Epic Mage Armor, take a Grt Str feat instead, and just take Epic Warding instead of Greater Ruin on your PM bonus feat.  You could also take a 5th level of Wiz, drop 1 level of Monk, and use that Wiz bonus feat to take a Great Int instead of using one of your Lvl-ups for it.  This should allow you to keep your existing Str, and still meet you Dev Crit requirements.  You lose Perfect Self and 1AC, but you also gain 1 AC from lvl 1 up, and your Wizard spells can give you the same protection that Perfect Self could (i.e., Clarity, Protection from ALignment).<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I thought about doing just that, and indeed the original build had 5 wiz and 15 PM, but either way I end up losing something too precious: monk mind immunity or PM epic spells.  If i ditched the Dev crit this would be a better build, because then I could take great fort feat instead of GC and replace overcrit/devcrit with str feats for 1 more AB/dam, or take epic fort and armor skin for 2 more AC, but the loss of dev crit would be a real detriment against those with epic warding or another means of high DR.  All in all i figured best to take dev crit if its available, since he can cast true strike a couple of times.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Faign on 09/05/05 16:53</span></i></p>

He doesn't gain Perfect Self until Lvl 37.  By this time you already have a minimum of 4 1st level Wiz castings.  With a duration of 5 hours, Protection from Alignment could cover all your bases(and give you +2 Deflection AC).

I think that Monk 21 Wiz 3 PM 16 works better since you get more AB.. you get the same stuff as this guy.. plus you have mind immunity from level 20 instead of level 37<br><br>-DaMouse

I did, but I would lose alot of discipline and tumble.  As for the PfA, that would only count against evil, and I intend to PvP so I can't take that risk.  Clarity doesnt last long enough for me to consider, and again, losing Monk20 kills my discipline/tumble unless i lose 1 AB (which is precious to this build).

I was thinking of Monk 21/Wizard 3/Pale Master 16.  You would keep the same build (monk 21 at level 37) but at level 20 take a monk level instead wizard...

Could someone clarify this for me, I thought that to qualify as a pale master you needed a spellcasting ability of level 3. Wouldn't that mean he needs to have 5 levels of a wizard?

No, just a case of the manual being badly written<br>You certainly only need 3 levels of wizard as I've been experimenting with that recently<br>PM isn't in the DMG so I can't check up on the PnP requirements but I think you need 2nd level Arane Caster spells and therefore 4th level Bard or Sorcerer<br>Not too sure on that though<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

Requirements for Pale master are three levels of Arcane spell casting, that is only 3 levels of Bard/Sorc/Wiz, not ability to cast 3rd or even 2nd level spells. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"><br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!

I know this is digging up dead horses, but I am trying to make this build, and I'm not getting access to level 3 spells, with only 4 levels in Wiz, as is required by the PM class. I don't get it. ( I have PrC installed, could this have meddled with it?)

PM requires only 3 level in any arcane casting class (bard, sorcerer or wizard) not access to lvl 3 spells.
