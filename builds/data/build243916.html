Alright, I’m back again. This time with a build that is a cross between my Artemis Entreri build posted a couple of days ago, and Kaliban’s <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "215056", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Death becomes you</a> build. <br><br>I made it a halfling, but for no specific reason. In fact, there are a number of races that would be more suited to this (practically all of them except gnome). I really just chose halfling because it’s my favourite race (and don’t try and tell me that there isn’t a race that you favour over the rest).<br><br>It’s still a dexterity based assassin/weapon master that gets the majority of it’s damage through the combination of death attack and criticals, but (thanks to the advice of grizzled_dwarflord - who suggested taking significantly less levels in WM) this time it also has Improved knockdown to give it a hand. <br><br>Also, it’s death attack causes more damage, and has a higher DC (thanks to the extra 5 assassin levels) and the added bonus of WS <b>AND</b> EWS to make those criticals just a little bit more painful. <br>Here it is!<br><br><b>The Honed Shadow - Fighter 8/ Weapon Master 7/ Assassin 25</b><br><br><i>Race</i> - Halfling <br><br><i>Alignment</i> - Lawful Evil<br><br><i>Playable from <b>15 - 40</b></i> <br><br><i>PvP</i> - Definitely; No questions asked.

Get's an okay dual-wielding AB and doable Death attack DC. The weapon master do still cause it to be majorly feat-starved, but since you want Weapon master in it, there's not much to do about that, except giving up a few Assassin levels.<br><br>As for your trouble's vs sneak/crit immune, that's what UMD and trap-setting skills(Which you do not have) are for. To get IKD, you must take KD as feat from among the feats listed at lvl 21 and 24. That means you can choose 1 of 3 feats at the other lvl.<br><br>All in all a nice build, though a bit feat-starved and it lacks trap-skills.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Interesting build Meph. I'd highly recommend dumping the exotic feat and going with daggers though. I realize your crit range will be narrower, but you'll open a pre-epic feat and you're using 3 of your epic choices for pre-epic feats, which is a shame, as there are a number of useful epic feats you could use in this build:<br><br>Epic Prowess<br>Epic Will<br>Armor Skin<br><br>You could also then move Finesse a bit earlier, which would give you a much better AB (it's rather gimped until level 9 as the build stands now).
