Well I have been playing this build:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "211533", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br><br>Awesome build, BTW, I can keep up with people 5 LVLs higher than me easy.<br><br>Well I have been playing this build and have made it to level 12. Well I just hit level 13, but have not taken the level yet, because I am at a crossroads.  The server I am playing at only goes to level 30 and this is an assassin.  If I stick to the leveling plan I will only have 17 Levels of assassin and wanted some advice on the continue of leveling.<br><br>OK, I am about to take level 13 and was wondering what would happen if I just continued to take assassin instead of taking more Ranger levels.<br><br>I realize that Ranger is a Discipline dump so I will want to take one more before my next fighter level or maybe just try to find some Discipline gear and wait till my next fighter level.  I do still want the fighter levels for WS and EWS, it's only 2.<br><br>If I don't go to Ranger 9 What will I miss out on?<br><br>I know that I will not get Improved Two-Weapon Fighting which gives me an extra offhand attack, and no animal companion at lvl 6.  How bad will my AB take a hit?  Will my offhand AB suffer greatly?  Would more Assassin levels benefit me more or would it hurt me?  I know that at 17 assassin levels my Death Attack DC will not be great or the Death Attack damage will not be that high.  Anything else?<br><br>Any suggestions or ideas would be greatly appreciated.<br><br><br>Thanks in advance,<br>Krylocke

I have thought of a few different ways you could go with this, but this is the way I would do it.<br><br>You have 30 levels to work with. I would go Ranger 10/Fighter 4/Assassin 16. At level 21 take your first Great DEX feat. Use the 10th level Ranger bonus feat and grab Epic Weapon Focus. If you continue with the rest of the feats as in Grizz's build you will end up with a DEX of 26. All you would lose in those 30 levels is 1 DC to your Death Attack.<br><br>I'm not sure how much AB will suffer, but I imagine it would be pretty substantial giving that you are trading Ranger levels for Assassin levels and not having Improved two weapon fighting. You can only take 10 levels of Assassin pre-epic anyways. That would still leave 3 more levels pre-epic you would have to use in Fighter or Ranger levels. And the fact that you want to keep the fighter levels in Epic for WS/EWS means that the most Assassin levels you could hope for would be 18 or 19 if you decided to go Ranger 5/Fighter 6/Assassin 19. Not worth it in my opinion.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By galelabriel on 03/14/08 05:48</span></i></p>

Well I just ran some tests in the Novice to Epic Builder and it went as follows.<br><br>If I go:<br><br>Assassin 19 / Fighter 4 / Ranger 7<br>Ab  33/28/23/18<br>    33<br>Dex 26<br>AC  24 naked<br>DA  10d6<br><br>If I go:<br><br>Assassin 17 / Fighter 4 / Ranger 9<br>AB  33/28/23/18<br>    33/28<br>DEX 24<br>AC  23 naked<br>DA  9d6<br><br>So no loss in AB.  If I go with 2 more Assassin levels I gain a feat that allows me to end with an even DEX score of 26.  I get 1d6 more DA. 1 more AC and 2 DEX.<br><br>If I go with the original plan I don't get that extra feet and so my DEX score will end on an odd number of 25.  So I can take a feat besides the great dex, like say Improved sneak attack which would get me up to 9d6 DA +1d6 Sneak. Or instead I could take Iron skin and get +2AC which would put me up 1AC. Also I get the extra offhand attack at 28AB which would be at 1-4+8 (2 from strength 6 from WS and EWS) which would be better than the 1d6DA that I get from going Assassin 19 / fighter 4 / ranger 7.<br><br>So it looks like I stick with the plan and level it the way the Dwarflord intended.  I take a hit of 2 DEX (ouch), no loss of AB because of ITWF, gain that offhand attack at 1-4+8, and either take Iron skin or Improved sneak attack.<br><br>Any other suggestions on what I should spend that feat on?<br><br><br>Krylocke

Well, if you take the 10th level of Ranger in Epic it allows you to take an Epic Bonus Feat that you could use for Epic Weapon Focus. So, instead of taking it as the general level 21 feat you could take a Great Dex instead. You would end up Ranger 10/Fighter 4/Assassin 16. <br><br>I guess it depends on what is more important to you. If you take the 10th level of Ranger you gain a bonus feat back and 2 points higher DEX which adds to your AB and AC. You would lose 1 DC to Death Attack and 1d6 Sneak Attack.
