I need help building a 26 Druid / 13 Shifter / 1 Monk, ive not really played a druid or shifter before so i dont know what to really take, on the specific server i play on the bonus from items carry over to morphs, so i was wondering what the best build would be to focus on Risen Lord and/or Iron Golem(not the elemental looking guy but whatever the other one is) And possibly going monk at 20 for 5 atks with a kama. I plan on taking my 10-13 Shifter so that i can get all my epic shifts to help in other areas also, But i really dont know anything to take for druid.

Here's a build that takes the above classes and gets all the Epic shapes, although it doesn't really focus on any shape in particular.  <br><br>When in Human form, the character should be a fairly strong caster, but his offense will be fairly weak due to his using a ranged weapon.  <br><br>Note that you get Infinite Elder Elemental Shape at Druid lvl 26, so you have pretty much all the shifting power you could want, with the exception being that you don't get the Epic Humanoid forms.  It's not really a big deal, although the Epic Kobold Commmando is kind of fun if you like to play Rogues.  <br><br>Although this character will be able to use a sling, if you want to use a bow you will need to buy the Martial Weapon Proficiency.  As for Kama, it doesn't make much sense for a Wis-based build.  <br><br>Of course, it is possible to do a Shifter build without being Wis-based (focusing on elemental, humanoid, or Undead forms) but you wouldn't be able to get Outsider, Construct, or Dragon Shape, as these all require a high Wisdom score.  <br><br> <br><br>Druid 26/Shifter 13/Monk 1<br>(pre-epic Druid 12/Shifter <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"> <br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 14<br>Con 14<br>Int 14 <br>Wis 16<br>Cha 8<br><br>+10 Wis<br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 14<br>Con 14<br>Int 14 <br>Wis 30<br>Cha 8<br><br>1 Point Blank Shot, Rapid Shot<br>3 Zen Archery  <br>6 Spell Penetration<br>9  Extend Spell <br>12 Toughness  <br>15 Greater Spell Penetration<br>18 Empower Spell <br>21 Great Wis I<br>24 Undead Shape<br>27 Great Wis II <br>30 Great Wis III,   Outsider Shape **<br>33 Great Wis IV<br>36 Construct Shape, Epic Spell Penetration * <br>39 Epic Reflexes   <br>40 Dragon Shape *<br> <br><br>* Druid bonus feat<br>** Shifter bonus feat<br><br><br>Note: If you want to maximize this builds' effectiveness at level 40, you will want to take your Monk level relatively late in order to max Discipline and Tumble.
