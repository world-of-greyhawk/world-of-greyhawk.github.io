I play on a server that is technically "epic", but once you hit low-20's for level its boring and tedious (same areas/stuff over and over) to go much further and most players stop about mid 20's in level.<br><br>There's a lot of very nice builds designed for epic play, but where do you all play them?<br><br>Let me know!

It depends on your play style, persistant worlds usualy have slow level progress, which is fine if you got alot of time or like roleplaying. When I play on a PW I always try to find a server with extremly low xp and good roleplayers, but that doesn't seem to be an option for you. I Dunno about any PW with high xp, but I know there are a few out there. If you like PVP then my suggestion would be to try Bastions of War. That is a PVP arena where you begin in the mid twenties and play up to level 40, but beware, if your build isn't good enough you will get slaughtered.

IMO the best PvP arena is <a href="http://www.antiworld.biz" target="_blank">Antiworld (CTF)</a>, if that's what interests you.<br><br>EDIT: linkified AW<br>_________________<br>Fanget av begravelsen<br>pines vi av guds godhet<br>ingen flammer, intet hat<br>de hadde rett vi kom til Helvete... <br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.burzum.org" target="_blank">Burzum</a> - Hvis Lyset Tar Oss<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 02/15/06 13:38</span></i></p>

Try The Heartlands Project PW. It is relatively fast leveling up to 20 then gets progressively harder, but still fast. The epic areas are challenging and give decent xp up till level 35 or so. All builds are welcome, but be warned there are some modifications to various feats and a custom Dev Crit in place that does not require you to take the feat. Be sure to visit the forum for more info or PM me. They have a thread over in Ye Olde Tavern.<br><br>Right now you won't find hardly anyone on due to most folks helping with getting ready for the transition over to NwN2.
