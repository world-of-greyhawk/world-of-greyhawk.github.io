Right been toying with a new build, had a look on the search engine and found only this with similar level combinations:<br><br>Undead Fencer (Bard 5/PM 16/WM 19) by kreestopearq<br><br>It goes for a focus on Longsword as Elf, however I wanted to get 4 attacks a round so have to be human.<br><br>I initially designed this build as PvP...getting really annoyed with those Dev. Crits so wanted a Pale Master...but with everyone's high AC I also need something with a high attack bonus...so decided upon a fair number of WM levels! Could probably do with a bit of improving so comments please. I'm sure it fairs well PvM as well though...<br><br>Ok now here we go:<br><b>playable from 1 - 40 PvP</b><br><br>Starting Stats (finishing stats):<br><br>Str - 16 (30)<br>Dex - 14 (14)<br>Con - 10 (10)<br>Int - 14 (14)<br>Wis - 8 (8)<br>Cha - 14 (14)<br><br>Levelling Guide:<br><br>1-Bard (1): Dodge, Mobility<br>2-Bard (2): <br>3-Bard (3): Expertise<br>4-Bard (4): +1 Str<br>5-Bard (5): <br>6-Bard (6): Weapon Focus (spear)<br>7-Bard (7): <br>8-Bard (8): +1 Str<br>9-Bard (9): Spring Attack<br>10-Bard (10):<br>11-Pale Master (1):<br>12-Pale Master (2): Whirlwind Attack, +1 Str<br>13-Weapons Master (1):<br>14-Weapons Master (2):<br>15-Weapons Master (3): Power Attack<br>16-Weapons Master (4): +1 Str<br>17-Weapons Master (5):<br>18-Weapons Master (6): Cleave<br>19-Weapons Master (7):<br>20-Weapons Master (8): +1 Str<br>21-Pale Master (3): Great Cleave<br>22-Pale Master (4):<br>23-Pale Master (5):<br>24-Pale Master (6): Improved Critical (spear), +1 Str<br>25-Pale Master (7):<br>26-Pale Master (8):<br>27-Pale Master (9): Epic Skill Focus (Discipline)<br>28-Pale Master (10): +1 Str<br>29-Weapons Master (9):<br>30-Weapons Master (10): Great Strength I<br>31-Weapons Master (11):<br>32-Weapons Master (12): +1 Str<br>33-Weapons Master (13): Great Strength II, Overwhelming Critical (spear)<br>34-Weapons Master (14):<br>35-Weapons Master (15):<br>36-Weapons Master (16): Great Strength III, Epic Weapon Focus (spear), +1 Str<br>37-Weapons Master (17):<br>38-Weapons Master (18):<br>39-Weapons Master (19): Great Strength IV, Epic Prowess<br>40-Bard (11): +1 Str<br><br>Skills:<br><br>Discipline 43(63)<br>Heal 43(42)<br>Intimidate 4(6)<br>Perform 16(18)<br>Spellcraft 43(45)<br>Taunt 43(45)<br>Tumble 43(45)<br><br>This leaves a massive 4 skill points to be assigned!

Nice build. I have an old, yet similar build I've never posted. Mine is Bard 8/PM 16/WM 16 (wanted to get Epic Warding) with Weapon Focus: Scimitar. Yours is a better combatant of course, due to more WM levels. My ending stats were:<br><br>AC 31 HP 406 BA 23	<br>AB: 	37/32/27<br>Fort Save	21<br>Reflex Save	22<br>Will Save	21<br>Skills: Max: UMD, Tumble, Spellcraft, Concentration, Discipline, + 20 points spare		<br><br>In looking at your build, you could push your first two PM levels to Epic since they bork your AB. I think going Bard 12/WM 8 would give you the best possible AB. <br><br>What about moving 4 points from Dex to Con, and relying on UMD and Cat's Grace to get your Dex bonus in Chain armor? That would give you another 80 HP.<br><br>And what about ditching the Great Cleave &amp; Overwhelming Crit route? Take Knockdown and IKD, and Toughness?<br><br>Just some thoughts. Cool build though!<br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br><i>This space for rent</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kaliban99 on 09/20/05 02:12</span></i></p>

Same AB, but more bard spells and song, plus better song. Would probably be a bit stronger, if you can do without that feat, and get immune to crit two levels later.
