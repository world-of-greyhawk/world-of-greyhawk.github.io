Nice build. Few changes I'd make:<br><br>Go with Scimitar for greater crit range and an extra feat, and take 9 levels of cot pre-epic instead of 8. Might help fort a bit. And maybe if you go with just 5 cot pre-epic you could fit in armour skin, but not really sure if it's worth the ab and the fact that at least 1/3 of your saves will suffer. <br><br>I'm a bit bored of pvp so I might try some rp, how would you rp something like cot/bard/hs? iirc Torm and his followers are lawful and follow strict moral codes and rules, etc... bard and cot seem like a bit of a contradiction to me, but I'm not exactly the most expierenced rp'er (most of it's from the Baulders Gate series which I haven't played in a long time), so if you could clear it up for me a bit that would be good.

Thanks D O'Brien123 for the points. Thing is she haas 10 CoT levels not 8! 2 are taken in Epic levels, the rest are pre-epic to increase your saves, AB and the feats needed (KD, IKD, IC, Blind Fight, etc).<br><br>The trouble with CoTs is that they need a focus in a melee weapon to qualify, hence taking Weapon Focus prior to her first CoT level. They do, however, have Martial Weapon Proficiency, but if you have to waste a feat already then why not take Exotic and then you can use all weapon types. You could of course take Scimitar, but this has a lower damage output than a Katana, and with the lack of WS/ EWS you could do with it to be honest. Is this making sense?<br><br>CoTs also don't have Heavy Armor Proficiency, which is just plain annoying, particularly in a build of this type, where you don't get it for free from another class type.<br><br>Armor Skin is not essential in this build, particularly when you benefit from a +6 AC bonus from your Bard Song and your enemies a -2 to AB through Curse Song. If there were enough feats free then I'd take it, but you can't have it all.<br><br>As Grizz says it is a misnomer and I agree. For me the class type of CoT can be used to replace A.N.Other God type, For instance Champion of Moradin for Dwarves, Corellon for Elves, as examples. I find it far too restricting to be limited to one God type, although of course you would need to be a non-evil deity.<br><br>In this case you could play it so that the character is an angel/ messenger sent to protect someone/ thing, etc.; or a natural Harper that received some kind of divine intervention during their lives. PWs and people's imaginations being what they are there are plenty of opportunities to develop your own story.

You have a very nice mix here, and for almost any world I would say that the RP potential is great. I am curious how you go about casting all of your bard spells while wearing plate armor. I figure the only reason for the heavy armor feat is to wear plate. The cats grace although stackable will not raise the AC beyond the one point allowed. I like the concept very much don't take it wrong, and would like to find a way around these if it is possible.<br>_________________<br>Thoughts too deep for words.<br>Words too deep for tears.

He's got Still Spell to cast in armor and stackable Cat's Graces basically grant the 12 DEX for a net +2 AC, beyond 12 you still benefit from a higher Reflex save anyhow.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?

Plate Armor is a must in this build to get your AC up to some sort of respectable position.<br><br>As Kail points out the stackable Cats Grace improves your Reflex save further.
