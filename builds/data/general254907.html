Not sure how to search for it in the builds list, other than looking at the huge list of clerics.<br><br>So I will ask instead:<br><br>Are there any epic builds that have the "Planar Turning" feat?<br><br>Maybe a pure cleric with "zen archery" because the WIS req is high and maybe "divine might" because the CHA is high??<br><br>Post a link if you've made one!<br><br>Thanks!

That smells like a LaLa topic.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Honestly, with 25 Wisdom and 25 Cha requirements... the price is way to steep for it's worth.<br><br>If you are looking to turn a lvl 40 Shifter Rak, you'll have to be a lvl 36 (minimum) cleric.  and at that level you'll be able to bypass the Rak's SR since it does not have 36 SR.<br><br>When turning outsiders, you have to bypass 2 things.  First is the HD check. That is just like the check you would do when turning undead.  Second check is to overcome the "turn resistance" which is their SR.  Your normal HD check value is used for that too.  With Planar Turning you 1/2 their SR value for determining if you can overcome their resistance.<br><br>Sun Domain helps buff up your turning power when it comes to the HD check.  Good/Evil domains allow you to turn Outsides like undead (simular to Planar Turning except you don't 1/2 the SR check).<br><br>I rolled up a build, and really did not like it since I had to pump most of my epic feats into cha and wis upgrades.  I took 10 Champion of Torm levels from 20-30 because CoT gets Greater Wisdom as a selectable bonus feat every two levels.<br><br>It still was a one trick pony build str/dex/con was just two low.<br><br>I guess you could have put a level in Paladin and 3 in monk to tweek out some ac/saves, but it's still a week epic build because of the lack of epic feats taken.

I have played a planar turning cleric.  A pure casting cleric.  Spent a lot of time in greater sanctuary, but the planar turning is neat.  Not only turns, but applies damage as well to outsiders.  It was a tough go, though.  Not sure I'd do it again.<br>_________________<br>TeoDeathDealer<br>Member of SoulForge PW (Action)
