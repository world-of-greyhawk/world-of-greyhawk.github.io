If it's possible, would it be decent?  I'd like Epic Dodge and Self-Concealment V if possible...And 10 levels of PM of imunities to sneak and critical...

Was thinking more PM levels for better AC...with much less Bard...at work now, so can't play with any builds yet.

I suppose you could drop bard down to 14 and sd down to 10 to get 16 pm for epic spells and still do well.<br><br>Actually that would work better <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  *mind not working*<br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while

I made something similar a while ago, although it had a lot less bard levels.  I found the AC to be very high, but unfortunately the character was next to no use at hitting things or casting a decent repetior of offensive spells.

Take 12 of the 14 bard levels pre-epic and 8 SD levels.<br>With a 14 bard level bard song, you should be hitting things, especially combined with curse song and taunt.<br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while

If you take elf with DEX 20 and take Great Dex II, you can get self concealment at your lvl 33, 36 and 39  regular feats. <br>If you take 16 lvls of SD, you get bonus feats at lvl 13 and 16.

With weapon finesse, bard song, taunt and buffing spells, you should be able to hit quite often if not every time.<br>If you want epic warding, you need 6 more PM lvls. I think you must take them from the Bard lvls. You get weaker spells and song this way, and you have to take PM lvls pre-epic ending with a lower BAB (max 14).<br>But IMO giving this character more defence with epic warding is overkill.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

So Bd 4/PM 16/SD 16??  Need to get the guy almost impossible to hit. Play in a PW with +10 items and +12 stat items available, but only at high levels and expensive.  Tired of getting PK'd by sneakers all the time...

I can't seem to get the levels to play out to get enough feats for all the Self-Concealments....any suggestions?  Lots of SD epic?  And don't really care to do much damage, just need to be able to not get hit and make a run for it....

Improved invisibility works nice in place of SC5.<br>You could just go for an excellent AC with epic <br>dodge and still possibly get devcrit.
