Greetings all.  <br>I just started G_D's "Bull Roarer";<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "254146", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>(something kin to a halfling from hell) and came across one small issue/question.  One of the early feats prescribed is "knockdown", but I notice in the feat description that...<br><br>"..a character can only make a knockdown attempt on opponents that are one size category larger or smaller then himself.  The opponent gets a +4 bonus on his opposed check for every size category he is larger then the attacker..."<br><br>Uhm... I'm thinking, a halfling is going to be smaller then most all of his opponents, so when ever he attempts knockdowns he'll always be working from a -4 disadvantage.  Is this feat really going to be worth it for this character?  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">     <br>Should I take something else or suffer with my -4 giveaway?  <br><br>Thanks for your help.  <br>I may go to bed and read this tomorrow.  zzz<br>It's been an up all nighter for me.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By mochamage on 10/10/07 09:13</span></i></p>

When you get Improved KD, you are considered one size bigger, so much of that -4 on the opposed check evaporates.  The Halfling is then considered medium sized, and can then make KD attempts on Large creatures.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Using Improved Knockdown on a halfing works good and all, the only enemies you can't knock down are huge size, but there aren't so many huge size, say, Elder Elementals are the most common I think, since dragons are immune to KD no matter your size anyway.<br><br>What you probbly don't want to do is take Knockdown without Improved Knockdown, because then you can't attempt to knock large creatures (plus you get disadvantage against medium creatures), and then you might get a good amount of chances where it's of no use.<br><br>Knockdown is a very useful feat, if your AB is high that -4 won't really affect you so badly, but you should try to get Improved Knockdown.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

There actually are some Dragons who are Immune, and some who are not.

If you knockdown unarmed you can knockdown huge creatures without IKD.  I would recommend improved unarmed strike (free with one level of monk) if you are going to do this.

Well, PvP shapeshifted characters using the feat: Dragon Shape are not immune to Knockdown, so they can be knocked (Discipline is still quite high with that STR)... but every PvM dragon I've seen is immune, perhaps not all, but it's a type of enemy you can expect to be immune.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
