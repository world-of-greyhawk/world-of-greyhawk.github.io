Hello,<br><br>Perhaps some one can recommend a good server that is good for RP and also lets you level up at a fairly decent rate. Not looking for a pure power server or heavy RP server but one that is balanced, middle to high Magic. Thanks

You could give World of Caenyr a shot.  Might be too heavy on the RP for you, not sure.  Levels up pretty quickly, level 20 server, probably high magic overall, but no permaimmunities/true seeing/etc.<br><br><a href="http://www.worldofcaenyr.com" target="_blank">http://www.worldofcaenyr.com</a> main page<br><br><a href="http://www.worldofcaenyr.com/phpbb2/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.worldofcaenyr.com/phpbb2/index.php</a> forums

Athas Reborn is based off the 2nd Edition world of Darksun. If your not familliar with the setting, it could be described as Mad Max meets the Hobbit. <br><br>We have custom races, classes, monsters and gear. Why hit another goblin with a +1 longsword when you can slay a tembo with a pair of obsidian wrist razors?<br><br>Magic is low to mid until epic levels, but leveling is fast, rp encouraged but not enforced and most people there build a dozen characters just for fun.<br><br><a href="http://www.athasreborn.com/forum/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.athasreborn.com/forum/index.php</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Deltutammatre on 02/03/09 01:19</span></i></p>

"RECON" aka Reconstructed Nordock is one.<br><br>A balance of RP and XP.<br>A few changes here and there to balance things out.<br><br>I suggest making a dummy character first, and read your journal.  Then plan a build.<br><br>I play there from time to time.  (OK the only server I play on.)

I'd recommend the Wheel of Time - The Third Age server. It was around a while ago, died a death because (I think) the person hosting it had lots of RL stuff going on, and has recently been started up again with a new admin team. There's a growing player base, reasonably quick levelling, but plenty of rp and frequent DM organised events. Also, since this incarnation of it is fairly new, anyone starting to play now can get involved in the major storylines from the start. Although it's based on Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time books, a detailed knowledge of the WoT canon isn't necessary, especially with the recent start (although I'd recommend reading the books anyway, as they're pretty good). Everyone I've encountered playing or DMing there is really friendly and helpful.<br><br>Guild is at:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "15898", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Enjoy.
