It seems to me you would do better to raise Dex higher, as this will raise your AB as well as your AC.  <br><br>Also, why 28 Cleric levels?  You get your last Cleric bonus feat at 26.

STR 14<br>DEX 14(5)<br>CON 10<br>WIS 15(26)<br>INT 10<br>CHA 14<br><br>I have to agree with changing the starting stats.  The 14 char isn't worth it for turning, since the +2 modifier generally won't have too much effect.  Too many needed attributes so ya gotta drop something.  As well the dex would be more beneficial, since you seem more melee focuses then a nuker.  And definetly do NOT use great con to boost con that is at 10.  It costs 1 point to boost it at creation, where your wisdom cost you 2 points to get from 14 -&gt; 15.<br>str 12<br>dex 16<br>con 12<br>int 10<br>wis 16<br>chr 8<br><br>Ending:<br>str 12<br>dex 26<br>con 12<br>int 10<br>wis 20<br>chr 8<br><br>Same amount of great xxx feats and you end up with much higher ab and ac, same con, weaker turning.

For Dex. AB I would need weapon finesse feat and still at least 19 to wisdom to get all the spells. AB bonus would be something like 2-3 (which isn't bad). With wisdom I get additional spell slots (don't know how many) and be able to penetrate spell resistance easier (I think?). It's 2-3 AB bonus &amp; reflex saves against spell slots, spell penetration ,will saves and one extra feat(wf). <br><br>Cleric levels bring nice duration/damage/dc bonus to my spells (spell resistance would suffer also) and to use harm efficiently I would need something to beat the spell resistance. Monk speed and imp. evasion sounds nice though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    <br><br>If I'd lower my strength, I wouldn't get divine might/divine shield and loose some damage and AB bonus. I have just enough Int to get the skills I need. Lowering charisma would mean taking divine might and divine shield out. Is that ac/ab really worth it?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Ajatar on 09/24/04 04:01</span></i></p>

What will help you penetrate SR is a high caster lvl and the spell penetration feats.  Also, how are you figuring +2-3 AB?  If you compare 26 Dex to 14 Str (what you had in your post), you would gain +6 to AB as well as Reflex saves.  <br><br>That's definitely worth it IMO.  Although you do lose a few spell slots and have to spend an extra feat, you can easily get rid of extra turning to make room for it, and the effect on your mind saves isn't a big issue because they will already be quite good anyway.  <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Cleric levels bring nice duration/damage/dc bonus to my spells (spell resistance would suffer also) and to use harm efficiently I would need something to beat the spell resistance.

As for damage, I believe most Cleric spells cap their damage at a certain point, although some of them may keep going.  I'm not that familiar with Cleric damage spells; I usually use Clerics spells for buffing and healing.  You are correct that your SR would suffer (from the Spell Resistance spell, which can be dispelled), as well as your ability to penetrate SR, and having a lower caster lvl would make it slightly easier for opponents to dispel your buffs, so it's really your call.    <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>If I'd lower my strength, I wouldn't get divine might/divine shield and loose some damage and AB bonus.

Divine Might/Shield probably won't be that effective with your build, mainly becuase your Charisma is so low.  Neither ability will last that long, and you have a very limited # of uses.  Not only that, but if you get rid of Divine Might/Shield you free up a couple of feats that can now be used for other things.

thanks for the feedback, it has been most useful <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br>I think I'm going to do something like fighter8/cleric26/monk6 with high dex, low cha and save some feats from power attack, divine shield and divine might. I'm not sure if taking 3 extra monk levels for imp. evasion is worth it, now when I have quite good reflex saves.<br><br>ps. I thought that bull's strength would have evened the score a little to a 2-3 AB

Doesn't taking monk lvls pre-epic lower your highest possible AB?  Divine powers bonus is not determined by you BAB from what seen, only how many cleric lvls.  On the mod I play it does make a difference when you take the cleric lvls but even with the new patch I am not sure it usually is that way.  If so, I'd recommend taking the monk lvls during epic lvls.

Is there any gain in taking two fighter levels post-Epic? You don't need 5 levels pre-Epic for AB.
