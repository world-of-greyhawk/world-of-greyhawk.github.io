Here's a build that I've been toying with for a bit and figured I'd toss him up here. There are a few examples using the same class combination, however all but 2 of those strike more of a balance between CLC and Rogue (one of them's a build of mine). <br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "209541", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Divine Swords Of Torm /Rogue 15/Cleric 15/CoT 10</a> by christian.schnabel<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "198416", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Blessed Sneak mk II /Rogue 19/Cleric 15/CoT 6</a> by Cinnabar Din<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "179145", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Sacred Swordsman /Rogue 17/CoT 8/Cleric 15</a> by CrispyCritter<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "204642", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Divine Commando Of Torm /Cleric 17/CoT 10/Rogue 13</a> by Ithacan<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "240405", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Dodgy Avenging Commando /Rogue 13/Cleric 17/CoT 10</a> by Ithacan<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "233874", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Battle Priest of Torm /Cleric 24/CoT 14/Rogue 2</a> by Kurgan13<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "143555", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> The Cleric Of Meb /Cleric 21/Cot 16/Rogue 3</a> by Nitricity<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "222251", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Faithful Adventurer /Rogue 17/Cleric 13/CoT 10</a> by Xylophone<br><br>The two exceptions (by Nitricity and Kurgan) go for high STR and lower WIS, so I feel this one's sufficiently different to warrant posting it.<br><br>Intended for PvM, and well suited to a low magic setting, although it might do alright in a high magic environment as well.<br><br>The Spellslinging Battlepriest<br><br>CLC 26/Rogue 4/CoT 10<br><br>Human, any non-evil<br><br>STR: 14<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 14<br>INT: 14<br>WIS: 16 (36)<br>CHA: 8<br><br>1 )CLC1: Martial Weapons/ Extend Spell<br>2 )CLC2<br>3 )CLC3: Weapon Focus<br>4 )CLC4: WIS (17)<br>5 )CLC5<br>6 )CLC6: Empower Spell<br>7 )Rogue1<br>8 )CLC7: WIS (18)<br>9 )CLC8: Spell Focus:Evocation<br>10)CLC9<br>11)CLC10<br>12)CoT1: Greater Spell Focus:Evocation/ WIS (19)<br>13)CLC11<br>14)CLC12<br>15)CLC13: Spell Penetration<br>16)CLC14: WIS (20)<br>17)Rogue2<br>18)CLC15: Greater Spell Penetration<br>19)CLC16<br>20)CLC17: WIS (21)<br>   <br>21)CoT2: Epic Spell Focus:Evocation/ Epic Weapon Focus<br>22)CoT3<br>23)CoT4: GRT WIS I (22)<br>24)CLC18: GRT WIS II (23)/ WIS (24)<br>25)CLC19<br>26)CoT5<br>27)Rogue3: Epic Prowess<br>28)CoT6: GRT WIS III (25)/ WIS (26)<br>29)CLC20<br>30)CLC21: Armor Skin<br>31)CoT7<br>32)CLC22: WIS (27)<br>33)CoT8: GRT WIS IV (28)/ GRT WIS V (29)<br>34)CLC23: GRT WIS VI (30)<br>35)CLC24<br>36)CLC25: GRT WIS VII (31)/ WIS (32)<br>37)Rogue4<br>38)CoT9<br>39)CoT10: GRT WIS VIII (33)/ GRT WIS IX (34)<br>40)CLC26: GRT WIS X (35)/ WIS (36)<br><br><b>BAB:</b> +24<br><b>AB with mundane weapon:</b> +30<br><br><b>AC in mundane plate and tower shield:</b> 31<br><br><b>HPs:</b> 412<br><br><b>Saves (vs spells):</b><br>Fort: 29 (38)<br>Refl: 25 (34)<br>Will: 38 (47)<br><br><b>Skills (239 points):</b><br>Concentration: 43 (45)<br>Discipline: 42 (44)<br>Spellcraft: 43 (45)<br>Tumble: 40 (40)<br>UMD: 40 (39)<br>31 points left over.<br><br><b>Spells:</b><br>10 level 1 spells<br>9 each of levels 2 through 5 spells<br>7 each of levels 6 through 9 spells<br><br>This character should be viable for both spellchucking <i>and</i> melee. Fully buffed with AB and STR maxed, his AB will be +56 (which isn't that bad) and he has various damage sources to add to his damage output with a weapon (Divine Favor, Battletide, Prayer, Darkfire, etc.) As for spells, he has a ton of them for buffing and to throw around at his opponents, including a possible 7 castings of Implosion (if one wants to spam those) with a DC of 41 (47 if WIS is buffed to the cap). Although the 26 caster levels and only 2 of the 3 Spell Penetration feats means he can't beat the highest stock SR <i>every</i> time, he can beat it 90% of the time, which is still quite acceptable, IMO.

I love these cleric/COT builds.  No surprise there I guess <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>This is a very nice spellcaster cleric setup here, your implosions are indeed to be feared and loathed... not to mention your blade barrier, storm of vengence, and hammer of the gods.  <br><br>An interesting side-note... at least according to the Grimoire, Earthquake ignores spell resistance.  So if you run into an enemy with higher-than-stock SR you can memorize some of those to tackle him.  I haven't had a personal experience with trying, but it's something I keep in the back of my mind when playing a cleric or druid.<br><br>I'm not as sure on the melee end... you can certainly manage to get a competitive AB in a low-magic or mid-magic environment, at least for fighting the cannon-fodder monsters.  But you don't have any melee tricks like KD or what-have-you, and you don't have improved combat casting, so I'm pretty sure I'd look at melee only as a way to clear out trivial opposition, or else as a last resort, were I playing this build.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Xylophone on 05/26/06 21:29</span></i></p>

Thanks for the input Xylo. As for the melee tricks, my thought is the only one he doesn't have that I generally consider essential for a melee build is Blind Fight. Other than that, I think he can still hold his own, considering the means he has of boosting AB and damage. Of course, against bosses, he should be using his spells to weaken/soften up the big guy, then fall back on melee to finish him off if needed. Kind of the melee mage mentality, I guess.

Looks good Cin, guess us old timers still have some builds left in us <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .<br><br>Just a suggestion,  drop the martial proficiency and take the spell focus at level 1, then you could take zen archery as a feat.  That would give you a 38 AB with a ranged weapon.  It would also increase your AB with ranged touch attacks (which includes a few cleric spells).  It would also make you fairly lethal with a bow as divine favor and couple other cleric buffs would increase ranged damage. Might also be nice to have a good ranged AB against those pesky rashaka shifters <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> .<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Thanks Mith. I thought of Zen Archery as well, but you need a Weapon Focus in a melee weapon to qualify for CoT, so I'd be focussing in one of the crappy Cleric weapons, but it's definitely an option. Hmmm, actually, it would give a decent ranged option on top of everything else. Not a bad idea methinks.

I don't like taking cleric 17 in pre-epic, costs you an AB.  and doesn't do that nice of a job with your saves.  you don't have a lot to work with, though, with only four rogue levels to disperse amongst forty levels and an obvious desire to have your CoT feats come in epic.  you could take rogue to 3 to avoid it.  and you could also use rapier as your weapon from the rogue class, trade martial for zen archery, as suggested above.  seems to me that you'd want to somehow have that primary stat count for AB somehow and that's how.<br><br>anyway, nicely done, and cheers.<br><br>Ithacan
