I have been sick, so i haven't been able to work on the server, so i apologize. <br><br>I know this is early, but I think i need to give some people some time to prepare. When we think we are ready to do so, the Epic Character Builder's server is going to have a tournament. I am still getting some rules ready, but here are some of the rules so I do not suprise people at last minute. <br><br>1. Battles amongst people will be only 1v1. All spells/feats will be allowed (this rule might change. we might remove timestop, but we are unsure)<br><br>2. Character builds MUST BE LEGAL! To enter the server, you must have a legal character or you are not going to be able to enter.<br><br>3. If we have too many people wanting to participate, we might do this over a couple of days. <br><br>4. Your builds must be original. You can not use someone else's build. (for example; You can't use the Dragon Kin build unless you are SBully or cdaulepp and you can't use the Magical Marauder unless you are Mithdradates.). <br><br>5. Upon entering, your inventory will be removed and you may purchase gear when you enter. I will fix the stores later on.<br><br>There are more rules that we will probably add,  but these are a couple of em. There is no date yet. If anyone else has ideas, please post here. I am going to be away for the next couple of days, so ill try to get online if i can get to a computer. Ill be back wednesday night. <br><br>Ty all <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"><br>_________________<br>"Computers are like air conditioners; They don't work when you open windows"

What is going to be the controllign factor for rule 4? Are they builds posted in this forum by the poster? Also what about players who posted very similar builds?

When i say original, i mean you can't use someone else's build. If you have a similar build but not the same, we'll probably allow it. If you copy someone's build and change it with only like 1 feat change that would hardly make a difference, then that will not be acceptable. <br><br>Any build posted in this guild or on the Featured Epic Builds are posted (divine warrior, reliable archer, dragon kin, etc) are only allowed to be used by their original owners. <br><br>We will only look in a person's build if a complaint is made. If we get continuous complaints from the same person, then we will ignore it (think about the story "The boy who cried wolf" <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> ). This issue shouldn't be a problem, i think. <br><br>Also, when it comes time for the tournament, I will be asking for some people who do not want to participate in the tournament to assist me in acting as a judge. I'll make a post when im looking for people to help me.<br>_________________<br>"Computers are like air conditioners; They don't work when you open windows"
