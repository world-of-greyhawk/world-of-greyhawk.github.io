<b>Playable from level 1 to 40... PvM build</b> <br><br>Here is yet another build which is not represented in the guild and this one surprised me.  It is a very viable combination which doesn't require any alignment shifts or carry any risk of an XP penalty.  The only problem is that you pretty much have to go DEX based on this one (STR based would suffer really badly on the AC) and the lack of damage really hurts this build.  Other than that you have a pretty good AC, tons of attacks per round, evasion, okay saves and a good AB.  Unfortunately, the build doesn't qualify for epic dodge or enough SC feats to make the investment worthwhile, still it is a pretty solid combo.  In testing it got its but handed to it by a dwarven defender, that and the low will save make me hesitate to recommend it for PvP.  It should do well in high magic PvM settings where devastating critical is banned and you can get weapons with good enhancement and elemental damage bonuses.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br>-Good AB.  An AB of 43 while dual wielding and in flurry mode is pretty good.<br>-Many attacks per round.  With haste and flurry he can get 10 attacks per round.<br>-Good AC.  A 65 is pretty good for a dual wielding character.  If he can buff his wisdom in addition to his dexterity he can get a pretty nice AC.<br>-Improved Evasion and an excellent reflex save. This build is in autofail on a 1 territory with his reflex save.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br>-Low Damage.  In a high magic setting this isn't much of a problem, but watch out for DR.<br>-Low will save.  Immunity to mind spells is probably the easiest type of immunity to get, but this can still be problematic.  The fortitude save could be a bit higher too, but with a couple of save boosting items it should be fine against spells.<br><br><b>Death by a Thousand Cuts</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Elf<br><br><i>Alignment</i> LN or LG<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 14<br>DEX 18<br>CON 12<br>INT 14<br>WIS 10<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>All 10 increase Dexterity<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Champion of Torm 8<br>Monk 13<br>Weapon Master 19<br><br><i>Level Distribution and Feats</i><br>Level 1: (Monk 1): Expertise<br>Level 2: (Monk 2)<br>Level 3: (Monk 3): Weapon Finesse<br>Level 4: (Monk 4)<br>Level 5: (Monk 5)<br>Level 6: (Monk 6): Weapon Focus (Kama)<br>Level 7: (Monk 7)<br>Level 8: (Monk 8 )<br>Level 9: (Monk 9): Ambidexterity<br>Level 10: (Monk 10)<br>Level 11: (Champion of Torm 1)<br>Level 12: (Champion of Torm 2): Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>Level 13: (Champion of Torm 3)<br>Level 14: (Champion of Torm 4): Blind-Fight<br>Level 15: (Champion of Torm 5): Dodge<br>Level 16: (Champion of Torm 6): Mobility<br>Level 17: (Champion of Torm 7)<br>Level 18: (Champion of Torm 8 ): Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack<br>Level 19: (Weapon Master 1)<br>Level 20: (Weapon Master 2)<br>Level 21: (Weapon Master 3): Improved Critical (Kama)<br>Level 22: (Monk 11)<br>Level 23: (Weapon Master 4)<br>Level 24: (Weapon Master 5): Great Dexterity I<br>Level 25: (Weapon Master 6)<br>Level 26: (Weapon Master 7)<br>Level 27: (Weapon Master 8 ): Great Dexterity II<br>Level 28: (Weapon Master 9)<br>Level 29: (Weapon Master 10)<br>Level 30: (Weapon Master 11): Great Dexterity III<br>Level 31: (Weapon Master 12)<br>Level 32: (Monk 12)<br>Level 33: (Weapon Master 13): Great Dexterity IV, Epic Weapon Focus (Kama)<br>Level 34: (Weapon Master 14)<br>Level 35: (Weapon Master 15)<br>Level 36: (Weapon Master 16): Great Dexterity V, Epic Prowess<br>Level 37: (Weapon Master 17)<br>Level 38: (Weapon Master 18)<br>Level 39: (weapon Master 19): Great Dexterity VI, Armor Skin<br>Level 40: (Monk 13)<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 14<br>DEX 34<br>CON 12<br>INT 14<br>WIS 10<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>AB and Damage</i><br>(no buffs, mundane kama)<br>47/44/41/38/35/32 2+1D6 (17-20 x3)<br><br>(no buffs, two kamas)<br>45/42/39/36/33/30 2+1D6 (17-20 x3)<br>45/40 1+1D6 (17-20 x3)<br><br>(no buffs, two kamas, flurry of blows)<br>43/43/40/37/34/31/28 2+1D6 (17-20 x3)<br>43/38 1+1D6 (17-20 x3)<br><br>(+12 to Dexterity, Haste, two +5 Keen Kamas, flurry of blows)<br>54/54/51/48/45/42/39/54 7+1D6 (16-20 x3)<br>54/49 6+1D6 (16-20 x3)<br><br><i>AC</i><br>35 (no buffs, no equipment)<br>65 (+12 to Dexterity, +5 robes, +5 ring of protection, +5 amulet of natural armor, +5 boots of the sun soul, haste)<br>71 (As above with +12 to Wisdom)<br><br><i>Final Saves/ Sacred Defense/ Vs.

Dunno. It seems feat starved and lacking in the power the some other builds along the same lines have.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

Aptly  named.  It will take a thousand cuts for this build to actually kill anything.  Then again, you might just live long enough to see it happen.  A sound battle strategy would seem to be:  <br><br>1) Target you opponent.<br>2) Attack<br>3) Go see a movie.<br>4) Check battle to see who's still alive.<br><br><br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"><br>_________________<br>In order to find his equal, an Irishman is forced to talk to<br>God.

I wouldn't say it's feat starved.  It gets all the feats one would want in a build like this other than epic dodge, which it wouldn't qualify for anyway.  The only real power shortage it has is in the damage department.  Granted it is a real disadvantage in a low magic setting, but when I tested it with +5 kamas that had +1D6 electrical damage it was killing pretty quick.  The extra criticals and multiple attacks make up somewhat for the lack of damage but it is a high magic build.  The AB is high enough that if you spam knockdown, you can keep most opponents off their feet.  Basically your strategy with this build is to spam KD and nickel and dime your opponent to death.  It isn't the best dual wield Kama build out there, but for an elf with no XP penalties it is pretty good.  It is also the only CoT/Monk/WM in the guild.<br><br>Hey, they can't all be juggernauts of destruction.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
