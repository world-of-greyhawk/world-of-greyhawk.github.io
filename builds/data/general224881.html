First of all, Id like to say Merry Christmas , everybody! Take care of your family and friends.<br><br>In Norway we say God Jul.<br><br>I'd like to post some info on the history of celebrating Christmas in Norway, and where it has roots. We celebrate on christmas eve, the 24th, today it's connected to the birth of Christ.<br>First of all, Norway was christened by Olav the Holy (Died in a peasant uprising in 1030) around 1025 and it went on for quite some centuries. Before that we worshiped the old Norse Gods, Odin being the King of the Gods.<br>We also call it "jul" not christmas. The name has nothing to do with Christ here.<br><br>The jul did not come to Norway with christianity, which many people believes. In Norway one can trace the celebration of jul back to Thorbjorn Hornclooves <i>Haraldskvede</i> (Kvede is a storytelling technique), which shows we had celebrations of jul at least before the year 900 - long before the christening of Norway.<br><br>The word jul is also of pre-christian origin, though the exact meaning of the word is unknown today. The word might originate from the month of jul celebration, "Ylir". An other possibility is that it comes from one of Odins names, "Jolnir", which can be connected to jul-celebration.<br><br>We know little about how they celebrated at that time, but in <i>Haraldskvede</i> they drank jul-beer in a ceremonial fashion, possibly in the name of Odin and Thor wishing for a good year and peace. With christianity introduced this ceremony did not disappear - possibly because the beer for jul-ceremony both had long tradition and was included in the religion. They did switch the names of Odin and Thor, and now drank for Christ and Santa Maria(Mary). "[.....] for a good year and peace" as the Law states.<br><br>The Blot (a ritual offering to the Norse Gods) has always been a central part of jul-celebration.<br><br>The celebration of jul itself did not happen in a particular day, and has even varied in length and dates. Usually it was the month of their winter-solstice, Ylir, in the period 14th of November till 13th of December. sometimes it was celebrated until <i>huggunott</i> on the 12th of January.<br><br>The tradition of christmas presents also pre-dates christianity in Norway. It was common that the King gave presents to his Greatmen, and that the Greatmen gave presents to their underlings. Eirik Jarl shall have given his people <i>jolagjof</i> (christmas present) on the 8th day after jul. In the soga of <i>Viga-Glums</i> the people shall have received presents when they left the jul-feast.<br><br><br><br><br>This was much info, to much for the un-interested.<br><br>But still I have more, a link to children of Odin, a small e-book, size about 0,5 MB. It contains stories from Norse myths, or Asatru, written in English. It is a perfect introduction to Norse myths and quite entertaining. It does not contain beliefs or lifestyle. Also worth noting, it is written by christians which bring it a concept of good and evil, two terminologies that didn't really exist in Asatru. As for Loki, use "the doer of right and the doer of wrong" f.ex. Enjoy.<br>Here it is: <a href="http://home.no/nordveg/ebok/" target="_blank">http://home.no/nordveg/ebok/</a>

Merry Christmas to you too, my Norwegian friend! I love you Norwegians <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  It's a real shame there's that &gt;&gt;Sweden&gt;&gt; inbetween us, isn't it? Just kidding! Now that it's christmas, even Swedes are to be loved. Nevertheless, the best music one can find will have its roots in Norway. Guaranteed.<br><br>Cheers.<br>_________________<br>Surely, without war there would be no loss - hence, no mourning, no grief, no pain, no misery...

Grimnir, God Jul to you as well! Thanks for the info, I found it very informative and interesting. Our neighbors (across the street) are Norwegian and we've become very close friends. We'll be having them over for Christmas Eve appetizers and drinks and will be going to their house for Christmas dinner. Great people, and great friends. (I'm hoping they'll have a 'blodkakke' - forgive the spelling - as it's one of my favorite desserts.)<br><br>Have yourself a wonderful and safe holiday.<br><br>Cheers.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...
