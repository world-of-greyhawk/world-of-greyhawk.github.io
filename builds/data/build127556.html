Hi all!<br><br>This is my first post so I look to the vast wisdom of this guilds members to let me know how best to tweak this build that I am planning on using it on a PW I play on.  Dev crit was not an option as I didnt really want it and it may not even be allowed on the PW too... not too sure yet.  <br><br>Dwarven Defender 23 / Weapon Master 7 / Fighter 10<br>Lawful Neutral<br>Male Dwarf<br><br>str16 -&gt; 24<br>dex13 <br>con18 -&gt; 24<br>wis8<br>int13<br>cha6<br><br><br>LEVEL, CLASS, SKILLS, FEATS, STAT<br>1 Fighter(1), Disc4,Lore4, Dodge Toughness<br>2 Fighter(2), Disc1,Lore1, Mobility<br>3 Fighter(3), Disc1,Lore1, Expertise<br>4 Fighter(4), Disc1,Lore1, Spring Attack, CON<br>5 Fighter(5), Disc1,Intim4,Lore1<br>6 Fighter(6), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, Whirlwind &amp; Weap Exotics<br>7 Fighter(7), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1<br>8 Fighter(8), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, Weap Focus(DwarvenAxe), CON<br>9 DwarDefender(1), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, Knockdown	<br>10 WeapMaster(1), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, (Weap of Choice-DwarvenAxe)<br>11 WeapMaster(2), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1	<br>12 WeapMaster(3), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, Imp Knockdown, CON<br>13 WeapMaster(4), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1	<br>14 WeapMaster(5), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, (IncMulti,SuperiorWeapFocus)<br>15 WeapMaster(6), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, Improved Crit(DwarvenAxe)<br>16 WeapMaster(7), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, (KiCrit), STR<br>17 DwarDefender(2), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1	<br>18 DwarDefender(3), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, Power Attack<br>19 DwarDefender(4), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1<br>20 Fighter(9), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, STR<br>21 Fighter(10), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, GrStr1 &amp; Cleave<br>22 DwarDefender(5), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1<br>23 DwarDefender(6), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, (Damage Reduct)<br>24 DwarDefender(7), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, GrStr2, STR<br>25 DwarDefender(8), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1<br>26 DwarDefender(9), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1<br>27 DwarDefender(10), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, GrStr3<br>28 DwarDefender(11), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, STR<br>29 DwarDefender(12), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, Great Cleave<br>30 DwarDefender(13), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1<br>31 DwarDefender(14), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, Overwhelming Crit<br>32 DwarDefender(15), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, CON<br>33 DwarDefender(16), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, EpicDamage Reduction 1<br>34 DwarDefender(17), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1<br>35 DwarDefender(18), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, EpicDamage Reduction 2	<br>36 DwarDefender(19), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, EpicDamage Reduction 3, STR<br>37 DwarDefender(20), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1<br>38 DwarDefender(21), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1<br>39 DwarDefender(22), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, Epic Weap Focus(DwarvenAxe) &amp; Great Con1	<br>40 DwarDefender(23), Disc1,Lore1,Heal1, CON<br><br><br>HPS = 726 Naked<br>DD = 		23*12	276<br>Fighter =	10*10	100<br>WM =		7*10	70<br>CON		7*40	280<br><br>AB with mundane Dwarven Waraxe = +41/+36/+31/+26<br>Saves = Fort 29, Reflex 20, Will 18<br>Damage Reduction = 24 (15 Dwarven Defender) (9 Epic Damage Reduction)<br><br>All comments are welcome and greatly appreciated!<br>_________________<br>"War does not decide who is right, but who is left"<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Rayne111 on 05/06/04 18:31</span></i></p>

You might want to consider spending skill points in Tumble instead of Heal.  If I recall correctly, for every 5 ranks of skill in Tumble, your AC goes up by 1.<br><br>Then again, depending on where you play, the ranks in Heal may be more useful.  =)<br>_________________<br>"The Sky is not the limit to Mastery, for (as any science fiction enthusiast can tell you) there are infinite worlds left to explore once the sky is left behind."<br>From "Role Playing Mastery", by Gary Gygax.

My one concern would be that the hp's are maybe a tad low for a dr build.  Not sure how to fix that though.

Use a two handed weapon, either greatsword, greataxe, or heavy flail. Don't get lore, it's pretty useless, put in either tumble or spellcraft. Switch 2 Fighter levels for DD levels since you won't lose a feat but you'll gain 3 more damage reduction.

Oh yeah. Well, it could still be worth it to drop 3 levels of fighter for DD levels. Get rid of 2 CON and get knockdown. You lose 40 HP but with the extra 3 DR you can actually take more damage as long as the average opponent deals out less than 60 damage per hit.
