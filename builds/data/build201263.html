I have reworked this build (many thanks, G R I E V E R, griphook, grizzled dwarflord, stravinksky/steve, and khandahr).  Griphook, I'd say it's best PvM, certainly playable 1-40, and maybe PvP (I am not the strongest swimmer, so to speak).<br><br>The Planar Scout combines supernatural speed, immunity and grace with the versatility and opportunism of the rogue.

Add monk's improved knockdown ability to create more opportunities for this extra damage attack. 9d6. <br>• Monk attacks. Stunning attack, flurry of blows, quivering palm. Six – that's six – d20 attacks per round. Seven with haste. Circle kick adds one free attack to any surrounding foe for a successful hit, once per round. <br>• Can set and craft traps. <br>• Decent fortitude and will saves, very good reflex. Add +2 to all saves for 4 CoT levels. <br>• Improved Evasion. The Planar Scout will either take half damage or no damage against damage spells.<br>• Immune to mind attacks, poison, and disease. <br>• Four attacks per round with weapon (longbow; no need to ever use a melee weapon)<br>• Decent AB for a character with rogue abilities: BAB OF 26; with unarmed attack, his unbuffed attack bonus is 39/36/33/30/27/24. <br>• Soak +1/20 damage<br><br>PLANAR SCOUT DISADVANTAGES<br><br>• Low Hitpoints.

Very nice!!! I like it alot. I'm really just starting to appreciate how much fun all the Rogue skills are in this game. I've mostly always played and made Straight melee, me crush!!! type characters, but now I'm having fun sneaking around setting traps and stuff. This build would be excellent at all that type of stuff. Like it's named an excellent scout!! Kind of like a Recon Marine, Hoorah!!! Semper Fi do or die gungho gungho!!!<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick. Long ago I learned to strike swiftly and without scruple. I trouble no man without cause, but one who attacks me had best resolve himself to die!

No question -- it's a stronger build as a LN Human than a LG elf.  With elf, you do get the elf weapons for your focus, you do get modal detect, and the spot/listen bonuses.  And you are an elf.  The alignment thing -- Lawful Neutral is bleh.
