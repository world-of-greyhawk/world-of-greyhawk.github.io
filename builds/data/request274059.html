Been messing around with a lot of build ideas, and have searched and found quite a few interesting ones. But I'm still not completely happy with any of them yet.<br><br>I want something which will give me good AC. I play on a PW that it's pretty much have good AC or die in a lot of areas.<br><br>I want a high WIS Cleric mostly. Like maybe 26-30 levels of Cleric. Then maybe 6 or so of Monk (for the free Improved Knockdown and Monk speed). Then ..?<br><br>I thought Shadowdancer. For the free HIPS and Uncanny Dodge (after 2 levels). He'll be DEX based and use Kamas so some sort of Uncanny Dodge is nice to have. But he'll take Trickery as one of his domains (as well as War), so maybe HIPS isn't the most needed feat there anyway.<br><br>I also thought Rogue. Like 3 levels worth. For the skill points and the aforementioned Uncanny Dodge.<br><br>Maybe Fighter. For the extra feats or two. Can never see to squeeze enough feats into my build.<br><br>I am wanting something that can cast a ton of Blade Barriers/Heals/Implosions. And can scamper away well enough after doing so. And not get hit a lot.<br><br>Those are some of my thoughts on the potential build.<br><br>Thanks for reading!<br><br>Joe

Are you going to be WIS based, or DEX based?<br><br>If trying to kill opponents with spells, you should be WIS based, since you'll end with the same AC whether you focus into WIS or DEX.<br><br>If going for melee, definitely go for DEX-based, and then I'd suggest something like, 26 Cleric, 9 Monk, 5 SD.  Or perhaps Fighter over SD (though you lose ED).

My favorite WIS AC Monks are made with dragon shift, nothing beats Kail's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225446", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Order of Jormundgandr</a> at that.<br><br>For non-shifters you can actually just take Cleric and Monk, the higher the Cleric level the best for penetration purposes, so a third class would work better with only a few levels, I'd take Shadowdancer, since it gives HiPS with no XP penalty, any non-prestige class will net XP penalty.

It doesn't really matter that much. If you choose Cleric and Monk as two of your classes it's almost impossible not to become powerful.

Well, sure, but don't take the fun out of powerbuilding.

A third class is always nice though, even if a WIS based spell-casting Cleric.  Fighter, for Armor Skin as the bonus feat, or Ranger for Spot dump, and Improved Combat Casting.  So, 38/1/1.  Though most prefer Monk early on, so 35/3/2 is slightly more desirable.
