<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>My initial goal when I started this build was to make an Arcane Archer who had access to the Tumble skill, Use Magic Device skill, and the Weapon Specialization feats.  It does have a large number of similarities to the Reliable Archer, but was created independently.  This is my first Epic Character posted into the forum so critique away at whatever mistakes I made.<br><br><br>Arcane Archer Build(Haven't thought of a title to give it)<br><br>[New Character]<br><br>Race: Half Elf<br>Alignment: Any non-lawful<br>Class: Fighter(1)<br>Abilities:<br>Str 14  +2<br>Dex 16  +3<br>Con 14  +2<br>Int 14  +2<br>Wis 10  =0<br>Cha 08  -1<br><br>[Character Progression]<br><br>Skills:<br>Fighter - Discipline, Heal, Open Lock(1)<br>Bard - Discipline, Heal, Spellcraft(40), Tumble(40), Use Magic Device<br>Arcane Archer - Heal<br><br>Levels:<br>01 Fighter - Weapon Focus(longbow), Luck of Heroes<br>02 Fighter - Point Blank Shot<br>03 Fighter - Rapid Shot<br>04 Fighter - +1 Dex, Weapon Specialization(longbow)<br>05 Fighter<br>06 Fighter - Called Shot, Toughness<br>07 Bard<br>08 Arcane Archer - +1 Dex<br>09 Arcane Archer - Dodge<br>10 Arcane Archer<br>11 Arcane Archer<br>12 Bard - +1 Dex, Mobility<br>13 Arcane Archer<br>14 Arcane Archer<br>15 Arcane Archer - Improved Critical(longbow)<br>16 Arcane Archer - +1 Dex<br>17 Bard<br>18 Arcane Archer - Blind Fight<br>19 Arcane Archer<br>20 Fighter - +1 Dex<br>21 Fighter - Epic Weapon Focus(longbow), Epic Weapon Specialization(longbow)<br>22 Arcane Archer<br>23 Arcane Archer<br>24 Arcane Archer - +1 Dex, Armor Skin<br>25 Arcane Archer - Epic Prowess<br>26 Arcane Archer<br>27 Arcane Archer - Great Dexterity I<br>28 Arcane Archer - +1 Dex<br>29 Arcane Archer - Great Dexterity II<br>30 Arcane Archer - Great Dexterity III<br>31 Arcane Archer<br>32 Arcane Archer - +1 Dex<br>33 Arcane Archer - Great Dexterity IV, Great Dexterity V<br>34 Arcane Archer<br>35 Arcane Archer<br>36 Arcane Archer - +1 Dex, Great Dexterity VI<br>37 Arcane Archer - Great Dexterity VII<br>38 Arcane Archer<br>39 Arcane Archer	<br>40 Bard - +1 Dex<br><br>[Character Completion]<br><br>Race: Half Elf<br>Alignment: Any non-lawful<br> <br>Class: Fighter(8)/Bard(4)/Arcane Archer(28)<br>Abilities:<br>Str 14  +2<br>Dex 34  +12<br>Con 14  +2<br>Int 14  +2<br>Wis 10  =0<br>Cha 08  -1<br><br>AB: +59/+54/+49/+44<br>Rapid Shot AB: +57/+52/+47/+42/+57<br>Damage: 1-8 + 20 (Critical: 19-20 / x3)<br><br>AC: 32<br>Fortitude: 26 <br>Reflex: 35<br>Will: 19<br><br>[[Notes]]<br><br>[Race]<br>-Half-Elf chosen as race to avoid XP penalty.<br><br><br>[Feats]<br>Blind Fight<br>Called Shot<br>Dodge<br>Epic Prowess<br>Epic Weapon Focus(longbow)<br>Epic Weapon Specialization(longbow)<br>Great Dexterity VIII<br>Improved Critical(longbow)<br>Luck of Heroes<br>Mobility<br>Natural Armor<br>Point Blank Shot<br>Rapid Shot<br>Toughness<br>Weapon Focus(longbow)<br>Weapon Specialization(longbow)<br><br>-Fighter may be necessary to recieve all feats.<br>-Blind Fight chosen with belief that it works with ranged weapons.<br>-Luck of Heroes is not critical.

The enhancement bonus to arrows improves on odd numbered arcane acher levels.

What about Bard 9 / Fighter 4 / AA 27?<br>Looses 1 AB, but gets more skill points and spell power ...

Diggin' this one up as it seems to be a popular class combo for AA munchkinheads. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    Surprised it's the only build posted!<br><br>As I understand it, you need to have two bard levels for you can take your first AA. Bards only have cantrips at first level, and 1st-level arcane spell-casting is the AA requirement.  I would suggest taking the bard levels at 3, 7, 12, and 40.  Taking them at levels 3 and 12 gives you the opportunity to take Extra Music, Lingering Song, or Curse Song and leverage the bard song a little bit at lower levels.  You may have to sacrifice some currrent skills/feats to do this, but it's something to consider.<br><br>I'm guessing (but don't know) that Imbue Arrow gets maximum damamge well before level 27/28, so I'd go with Fighter 9/Bard 4/AA 27.  Also, I *think* you need to take the 8th fighter level at 22 to get the epic weapon spec.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By sketchy_c on 11/02/05 16:41</span></i></p>
