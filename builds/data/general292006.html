Lately I've been seeing a lot of builds that get an animal empathy high at the end sometimes in the 50s.  I also know from usage that animal empathy is rendered useless if the target creature has immunity to mind spells.  Thus the druid /shifter is unable to empathize with most summons, all familiars, and the spider animal companion.  The toolset does not show an example for any animal close to level 40, thus it seems that epicly high animal empathy is mostly to be used in druid battles for subverting animal companions.  Servers could of course implement their own creatures, but from what I'm seeing the more powerful the creature the more likely it is immune to mind spells (especially the exotic ones).

As you say, it's mainly used on servers that have custom animals.  I've seen many "Legendary" animals that have had a high resistance to the domination.  Mostly, people dump points into that skill because they can.  Having a potential meat shield is always good.

It's a level 20 animal without immunity to mind spells, so it's DC 35 to dominate via animal empathy. That at least gives you a reason for epic skill levels, albeit not a reason for going into the 50's.<br>_________________<br>Sorry.

I think TyrTemplar mentioned to me once that animal empathy can be used to paralyze or stun characters in animal or magical beast shape. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Yes the panther familiar is susceptible to empathy.
