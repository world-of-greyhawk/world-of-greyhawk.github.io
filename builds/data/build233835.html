Sneak attack helps, but you won't always be able to use it, and in that case, EWS increases your damage by two to seven times.

You will be fighting a hefty xp penalty the whole life of the character, even after lv 40!!  The other thing, is if I were to lvl this toon for playability, you really need to look at movin the feats around and the order!  <br><br>Then again, you did say he was born at 40 so...  I just put this in here for those who would actually try to lv this through.  Me tinks it wood be herd..  but watz du I nO! *rolls 1 vs intelligence check*

Dodge offers some advantage at least, but mobility and spring attack are a waste of feats for a dexer. You'll never provoke AoO anyhow. <br><br>I would consider getting WF/EWF: unarmed too and work in WS/EWS: unarmed also. Dropping dodge, mobility, spring attack and epic fortitude should do the trick, plus moving some FTR in epic. You'd get better saves too. <br><br>UMD is enough set at 41 and spellcraft at 18. Both work with modified ranks in multiples of 5.<br><br>What about some trap skills? Trap setting is a useful strategic tool.<br><br>Overall, I think human would be a better choice for lvling the build, just keep FTR and rogue within 1 lvl of each other. -1 AB/AC but more HP, 1 more feat and +43 skillpoints (traps!) and no xp penalty.<br><br>BTW, where do you do PvM with characters born at 40th lvl?<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

I agree about dropping dodge, mobility, and spring attack. You might want to consider taking Called Shot (Called Shot: Arm is a good defensive ability).<br><br>I would also consider taking the first level as a Rogue for more skillpoints, and lower starting Dex to 16 and raising Wis to 14 (you will gain AC and Stunning Fist DC).<br><br>TM

As to the fist using advise, I have to say no. Fists unfortunately are very good in low magic equipment environments, but once you get weapons with better enhancements, your kamas will gain damage, DR penetration, and AB. Gloves will only gain DR penetration and AB. Not to mention the fact that you don't seem to find ultra-cool gloves that do huge amounts of damage very much. <br><br>Thanks for the advise on the saves. Taking Monk 12, Fighter 8 pre-epic would still work, I just thought rogue would make it more playable.<br><br>You can ditch mobility and spring attack if you want to (IC: kama if you want as well, it's not critical <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">     so to speak.) I don't believe the extra focuses and such are necessary for unarmed combat. Unless you have some serious DR to hack through, I wouldn't bother. Epic Fortitude should stay though. With improved evasion and twentieth-level monk, its the only save that he's really vulnerable in. <br><br>Another reason not to use unarmed combat - less attacks per round means less sneak attacks when you get the chance. And when you start sneak attacking, fist vs. kama damage difference shouldn't make too much of a difference.<br><br>Called Shot could also be a good idea, yes. Increasing wisdom wouldn't be a particularly bad idea, but dual wielding has its shortcomings in the form of AB. And stunning fist and quivering palm don't really help if you are not going to use your fists. Quivering palm doesn't help anyways - you can only take out twentieth level guys that you shouldn't be having trouble with anyways.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Dark Centurion on 03/15/06 18:38</span></i></p>
