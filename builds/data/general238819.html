Ok I have abuild printed out at home from this guild - I am positive!  If I recall correctly it was a build by Tattoo Monk of a Rogue/Fighter/SD.  I have done a search on pulse cap and could not find it.  So then I go through the listing back to December 2005 and did not find it.  My eyes may have gone cross near the end so I am appealing to the guild to help me find this build because it is fantastic!<br><br>Details I know the SD levels are 5.  It obtains ED at 21 and SC V by the end.  I know the little guy is a halfling.  I recall him mentioning that the level split was unique when it was created.  Do a search for Rogue 1-40 Fighter 1-40 and SD=5 and you come up empty.  <br><br>I am willing to vouch for TM for this build as I have a hard copy at home but I am at work - working hard <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">

His name is Tattoed Monk - after a Monk PrC, I think - and he hasn't been a member of this guild for too long -- looking for his builds in 2005 is going to turn up nothing AFAIK. Cannot remember when he joined, though, so I might be  wrong <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Nevertheless, I think this is what you were looking for: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "237511", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>posted 17 April 2006 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 04/26/06 12:05:52 (GMT) -- Ithacan<br><br>[...]Harper Scout, the only class so powerful it's capped at five. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    <br>[...]</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">
