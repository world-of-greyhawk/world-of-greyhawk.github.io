As much as I despise heavily multiclassed monk builds, Ive just found a char based on a similar concept that can do 216 d6 sneak damage per round....<br><br>I'll post this when Ive refined it.

Why do you use daggers instead of short swords? Is there a particular reason behind this?

There is no reason whatsoever why you shouldn't/can't use short swords, since the char has no weapon foci.  I guess I just chose daggers because they are cheaper at 4gp each, compared to shortswords which cost 20gp.  Come to think of it, light hammers have a list price of 2gp so that would represent an even better economy.<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">
