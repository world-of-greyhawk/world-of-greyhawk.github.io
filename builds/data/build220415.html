You could take your last bard level at 39 and take either lingering song (for an additional 5 rounds of bard song) or curse song (to inflict your bard song on your foes).  Not sure if it's worth it, given what you'd have to give up.  And really, if you are going to win with this build, you are going to win pretty quick with its high AB and damage output.

I just don't know what other WM feat I'd like at that point.  You would lose an AB for the WM level 19 but gain +2 to your AC by bard song.  Then you'd really have to start thinking about adding curse song to the build.  The point here was to max out AB in a high-damage build.

i would give up greater str and take exotic weapon feat instead , i think you loose 1 point base ab and 1 point ab due to the loss of str but you could go with sythe then , way more effective than spear. or use some axe if youu want to go with shield. also the keen edge spell works on both weapons.

It ain't quite as simple as that - you'd need to take exotic pre-epic and focus in it, get the WM prereqs and delay the WM levels. You'd lose AB that way but you get a better weapon. Also, which classes are you going to take to fill in the remaining 4 levels pre-epic? You'd probably end up as a Bard 14/WM 16/RDD 10 that way.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.
