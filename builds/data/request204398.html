"to give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.  Teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime."<br><br>What you are looking for is a dwarven ftr/defender build, focused on constitution.  THere are a few listed in the epic build page.   For what you describe, you want the lvls to be 10 ftr/30 defender or something to that effect.  <br><br>The best thing to do AFTER lookin through the builds is to download a leveling mod from bioware and run a few tests to see what you like.<br><br>happy fishing  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

I would suggest you look into more of a Cleric / Dwarven Defender build.  Cleric buffs will really aid you and boost yerself in a great way.  Add Expertise - Improved Expertise if you feel there'll be times where you REALLy don't want to hit anything, but let others do the killing while your enemy swings and misses on you.<br><br>That being said, I believe some PWs (or it bioware itself) have taken steps to change the attack UI of certain Monsters, to target player characters that are the biggest damagers in the party, so then you could be tank, but they would veer off you, and try to hit another party member anyways.<br><br>You could also look into Drallimer's Divine Wall.  It combines WM with DD.  Feats are a bit stiff in it, but it's an interesting play.
