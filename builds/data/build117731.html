Hi there,<br>I've been reading this topic (and the last one) from the start and there are very cool works. Keep up the good work, pals.<br><br>I'm a Cleric Fan. I mostly like playing a Chaotic Good BattleCaster Cleric. Mostly Direct Damage spells and Melee fighting. (if you ask "Why?" the answer is "that is how I enjoy my game" )<br><br>I made a character build thinking that I can attain 27th level if I finish the HotU OC. I haven't played the HotU OC, yet. So I may be wrong about the level. I'd like from the people here to evaluate this build and point out bads and goods, give constructive advice if they can. Here goes my humble BattleCaster Cleric...<br><br><br>--------------------------<br>Human/Male/Chaotic Good<br>Fighter(1)/Cleric(26)<br>STR:14<br>DEX:12<br>CON:12<br>WIS:16(22)<br>INT:10<br>CHA:10<br><br>Level Progression<br>1st:Fighter1 Lore+4, Concentration+4 Luck of Heroes, Power Attack, Cleave<br>2nd:Cleric1 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+5 Air Domain, Sun Domain<br>3rd:Cleric2 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1 Improved Initiative<br>4th:Cleric3 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1 WIS+1<br>5th:Cleric4 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1<br>6th:Cleric5 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1 Great Cleave<br>7th:Cleric6 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1<br>8th:Cleric7 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1 WIS+1<br>9th:Cleric8 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1 Combat Casting<br>10th:Cleric9 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1<br>11th:Cleric10 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1<br>12th:Cleric11 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1 WIS+1, Spell Focus (Evocation)<br>13th:Cleric12 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1<br>14th:Cleric13 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1<br>15th:Cleric14 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1 Greater Spell Focus (Evocation)<br>16th:Cleric15 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1 WIS+1<br>17th:Cleric16 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1<br>18th:Cleric17 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1 Spell Penetration<br>19th:Cleric18 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1<br>20th:Cleric19 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1 WIS+1<br>21st:Cleric20 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1 Epic Character, Greater Spell Penetration<br>22nd:Cleric21 Concentration+1, Lore+1, Spellcraft+1 Epic Cleric<br>23rd:Cleric22 Spellcraft+1<br>24th:Cleric23 Spellcraft+1 WIS+1, Superior Initiative, Improved Combat Casting<br>25th:Cleric24 Spellcraft+1<br>26th:Cleric25 Spellcraft+1<br>27th:Cleric26 Spellcraft+1 Epic Spell (Dragon Knight), Epic Spell Focus (Evocation)<br><br>Final Skills:Concentrate(25), Lore(25), Spellcraft(30) + 40 Skill Points to spend on any skill preferred<br><br><br>PS:I really can't explain why I took something at somepoint because I'm very new at this thing and the only reasonable explanation would be "Because I thought that was good"<br>_________________<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 17:24</span></i></p>
