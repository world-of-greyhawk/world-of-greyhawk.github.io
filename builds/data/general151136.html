I was wondering if shifters forms gained any more bonuses for the mroe shifter levels taken, such as DR,Feats.....etc.

For the most part, no.  Special abilities with DCs (vampire gaze, basilisk gaze, etc.) get better, and you can use them more often for those that are limited.  Damage from special abilities also increases (dragon breath, stone golem boulders, slaadi spittle, etc.).<br><br>Pre-epic shapes also get epic upgrades, but those are fixed and once you get them, they don't upgrade again.  DR and stats are fixed for each form.<br>_________________<br>"Intelligence is knowing a tomato is a fruit; Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad."
