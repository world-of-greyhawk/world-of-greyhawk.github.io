I tried to make an <b>Unarmored</b>Iconic Weaponmaster but after putting in all the advantages listed below it ended up being a little meta. But still a great build IMHO.<br><br>Note: The weapon I speak of in this build was included in the CEP pack and uses the greatsword model.<br><br>And by all means if your blademaster is about to face a major battle, strap on your Samurai armor, you wont be losing much of the 6 monk levels.<br><br><b>Blademaster</b><br><br><i>Advantages</i><br>Devastating Critical<br>Improved Whirlwind Attack<br>Blinding Speed<br>Decent AB 46/47<br>Decent Naked AC  25/27<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br>388HP (Max)<br><br>Human Lawful Neutral<br><br>Starting Stats<br>16 Strength<br>17 Dexterity<br>10 Constitution<br>13 Intelligence<br>8 Wisdom<br>8 Charisma<br><br>Raise DEX at 8,16,28,36<br>Raise STR at 4,12,20,24,32,40<br><br>Level Spread<br>Monk 6/Fighter 6/Weaponmaster 28<br><br>Our Blademaster was born inside a monestary where he was brought up by monks which prepared him for the intense training into becoming what he is today.
