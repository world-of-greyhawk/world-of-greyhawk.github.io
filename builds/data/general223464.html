This is just plain wrong. I sitting here, laying out some general lines for a more RP-oriented build which was supposed to use a Quarterstaff. So, I began... after a while I had it figured out and loaded my leveler module. I built the character and all seemed fine.<br><br>UNTIL I EQUIPPED THE DAMN QUARTERSTAFF! "Offhand weapon: not applicable", it said. "This must be some soft of error", I thought, and re-equipped the weapon. "Offhand weapon: not applicable", was still there. At this point I fell off my chair and started crying like a little baby, "why, why, why!?". That went on for... some time, and when I was done with that I got seriously pissed and loaded a practise opponent. Being a Cleric, I cast the standard Darkfire and look at that - the fire is on both ends of the damned stick! Then I realized it probably was meant to be a double-sided weapon, and went to the toolset (after beating the practise opponent to a bloody pulp).<br><br>In the toolset I found Quarterstaff under "double-sided". This convinced me. It must be a bug. So, I checked out the baseitems.2da and changed Quarterstaff to a double-sided weapon by simply changing one of the figures from 4 to 8 -  as simple as that. I was satisfied; my build had a purpose again.<br><br>So, the purpose of this thread is to... hony my skills in writing in English? No, not that... well, it's the official thread for whining about quarterstaffs <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">   Are you with me people? <b>Let's make quarterstaff be the epic weapon it was meant to be!</b> (ie. have BioWare change that 4 to 8 in an official patch, meh)<br><br>Thank you for reading this meaningless BS <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>EDIT: must've been too emotional writing this<br>_________________<br>&lt; XmikeW&gt; im glad though.. i used to think that -all- finns were supersmart nerds.. but, after seeing 1) (C) law ..2) your culture minister ..and 3) the äm-irk girls... i can say that you guys are definately typical human beings after all [smile_:-)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 12/11/05 20:46</span></i></p>

I don't mind quarterstaff being a two handed weapon. It means that mage's can use the weapon without any special feats, and I think that it is most traditionally viewed as a mage weapon. <br><br>I am guessing that you are a PNP'er who is somewhat disappointed by the translation of this weapon. It would be nice if there was an option to wield a double-sided weapon as either two weapon or double handed, but I guess this option is not possible within the game engine.<br><br>What about using the dire mace and calling it a war-quarter staff? It pretty much fits the build and nets you a d8 damage.

Finneous,  I couldn't agree more!!   <br><br>A quarterstaff is the quintessential double-sided weapon if their ever was one.  If a quarterstaff isn't getting an off-hand attack then it isn't a quarterstaff...its a club!!<br><br>Of course, to be fair, I have heard good arguments why it isn't. Namely that it wouldn't be a simple weapon anymore (probably martial, would guess). That would mean that Wizards and other non-warrior classes wouldn't have access to it unless they cross-classed or burned a feat.  <br><br>But I disagree. Let it be a simple-double-weapon. Yes, without the proper feats (Two-weapon fighting, Ambidexterity, Improved...) you will suffer quite an AB loss, but that's the price you pay for wanting to master this weapon.  Otherwise, use a club or a dagger. Besides, a Mage staff isn't a quarterstaff, so wizards could still use them without issue.<br><br>just my 2 cents...

Ohmygod, 8 responses by now! My first TOQT ever and it's already grown to be a huge, innovative and intelligent discussion. Thank you for contributing, and siding with me on this issue.<br><br>Now, I think it is time to STICKIFY this thread and move on to the general discussion on the official NWN forum. Justice prevails as TOQTs take over!<br><br>And, of course, since we have grown this big, we should form a guild and set up a demonstration at the BioWare headquarters(taff, hilarious).<br><br>Seriously though, it's cool that other people have noticed this and agree with me. We can only hope that NWN2 allows this sort of functionality (changing wielding styles).<br><br>Oh, avado, no need to apologize, I have already forgiven you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  Better yet, since you already have done well and taken part in this thread, why don't you express your opinion on the actual matter.<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>Surely, without war there would be no loss - hence, no mourning, no grief, no pain, no misery...

If that long pole of wood is a quarterstaff, then who can wield a wholestaff? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Seriously though, having studied martial arts myself, (though not staff-fighting(aikido?)) you can look it up, and see different combat techniques. I am no expert on this, but I think the style switch is doable. F.ex. using it as a 2-hander and, like the bastard sword, spending a feat to be able to use it as a dualweapon(in this case).<br><br>I took a quick peak at it, and one shall basically hold one hand on the middle of the staff. Then the other hand should be placed halfway between that and the end of the staff. That opens for two handed strength, or more agile dualstyle, the low grip defending the offhand damage.<br><br>My two cents worth of ranting on this.
