<b>Playable 1-40 PvM. Better and better later on. Can do okay PvP in a mid-low setting.</b><br><br><br>It was a fine sunny morn’, and Brink Silvermane had been called to his King. He had been one of the King’s best knights, and his most trusted. In an attack from some evil priests he had given his life for his King and his people. He was able to stop them, but when his own life was ebbing out he had been cursed by the dying words of a priest. He had risen as a Death Knight, and became a terror for his people instead of their champion. His soul had become black as the deepest cave on the blackest night. But his soul was still in there and his inherent goodness slowly started to surface. These days he had atoned for most of his foul deeds, still there was some way to go. He was able to convince the king to take him back into his service, but he knew no-one trusted him as they had did. Being a Death Knight had it’s drawbacks, obviously, but it had made him powerful. He commanded magical powers inherent in Death knights, and weapons couldn’t injure nearly as easily as they had done. He did never tire and never needed sleep. But still he longed every day to be alive, to feel the pleasures of man. He was tall and handsome, his hair almost radiating silver. His skin was pale however, his eyes held no life and something sinister still clung to him.<br><br><i>“Yes, my King?”</i>  he said, obviously eager to know what the King needed him for. <i>“Good morning, sir Silvermane. I’m glad you responded so quickly.”</i> His King stated. <i>“Always , my King!”</i> Brink bowed deeply. The King continued <i>”I have received grave news today.” He paused for effect “I received news that the whereabouts of Devils Cave had reached evil ears.”</i> Brink knew this was bad news. Devils rock was the place he and his men, one of them a Cleric of Torm, had defeated a foul Devil and imprisoned him in stone with a holy ritual. <i>”They are probably planning to release this Devil and use him as a ways to gain power. With him at their sides, our Kingdom could very well be in peril.  This must not happen!”</i> Brink understood that this could very well be a problem. They had barely defeated him last time, and that was with the help of a cleric that had long experience in battling fiends from Hell. <i>“I will make haste, my king. I will do all I can to stop them before they can free him.”</i> Brink turned to leave, but was stopped from a hand on his shoulder. It was his King. He looked him stern in the eyes. <i>”Not alone this time, my friend.”</i> Brink realized his King hadn’t called him that since he was alive. He wasn’t quite sure what it meant. Perhaps he was starting to truly trust him again. <i>”Bring with you the noble adventurer who brought this grave news to me. Enter, lady Goldwing!”</i> Rakne said.<br><br>A tall female entered the room. Just as tall as sir Silvermane he noted. He looked upon her, astonished. She had broad shoulders and a well-muscled body. Her face was as fair as any Brink had seen, and her body was voluptuous and full figured. Her eyes were sparkling golden and her hair flowed long and was as golden as Brinks was silver. Even her skin had a slight golden hue, and she had gold-coloured wings on her back. To top it off she wore a beautiful silk dress that promoted her natural figure even more. He also noticed she had taloned fingers. A half-Dragon, he realized, and a Gold one at that. No wonder about her beauty and strength. <i>”This is Lady Sadine Goldwing!”</i> The King stated loudly <i>”A follower of Torm, like yourself. Meet sir Silvermane.”</i><br>Brink bowed deeply and took her hand and gently kissed it. <i>”Charmed, Milady.”</i> Though it was courteous to say so, he truly was. He noted to himself that he been alive he would probably have courted her. <i>”Thank you”</i> she said, smiling <i>”nice to meet you, sir Silvermane. Your reputation precedes you. And you look every bit as capable as the reputation claims you to be.”</i> <br><i>”You flatter me, lady Goldwing. Let’s hope I, or rather we, are capable enough to stop this threat at least.”</i> he answered. Had he not been undead, he would probably have blushed.<br><br>After a short chat they had left to make quick preparations, put on their armours and filled their supplies. They were able to travel quite quickly, since Brink didn’t need any rest at all, he kept watch while Sadine and the horses got the rest they needed. Just shy of a week they made it to the mountainside where Devils Cave were located. Since they had travelled somewhat fast, they were sure that they had not arrived long after the people they were after. They found a meadow for their horses, and went towards the cave. They looked towards the entrance and saw two guards standing just outside, but from the voices, it had to be at least three. There was no way for them to rush up there and dispose the guards before one of them would raise the alarm. <i>”Help me get my armour off”</i> Sadine said. Brink understood what she was about to do. He helped her off with the armour, like he had every night. And back on again in the morning. He knew it would have made his heart beat fast in the old days, but now it didn’t even take one beat. She left the forest wearing only thin and minimal clothing and walked slowly and seemingly unsure towards the guards. <i>”Excuse me?”</i> She said softly as she approached the guards. She had no way of hiding her wings, but they had probably seen equally strange humans before. They just looked at her at first, almost paralyzed. <i>”I am lost, handsome warriors. Perhaps you could help a lost maiden?”</i> She kept her voice as alluring as she could. They immediately forgot their duty and went over their way to get close to her and be helpful. Once she had all three of them within range she suddenly exploded into motion. She punched the first one as hard as she could right in his gut, knocking the air out of him. Then she grabbed the other two guys by the side of their heads and slammed them together hard. They fell limp to the ground. A quick blow to the head finished the one gasping for air. Brink rushed up the side with her blade and armour. They put it on as quickly as they could, and hog tied the guards.<br><br>For the rest of the story <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "227075", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>_____<br>This some kind of variant of the eternal crusader, and no alignment changes necessary.<br><br>Human LN (or must be TN or CN)<br><br>STR 16(26)<br>DEX 8<br>CON 12<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 16(19)<br><br>1:Sorc: WP: Martial; Expertise<br>2:Sorc:<br>3:Sorc: WF: Longsword<br>4:Sorc4: CHA(17)<br>5:PM1:<br>6:Sorc5: KDown<br>7:PM:<br>8:PM3: CHA(18)<br>9:Sorc: Imp.Expertise<br>10:Sorc:<br>11:Sorc: <br>12:Sorc9: Still spell; STR(17)<br>13:PM4:<br>14:Sorc10:<br>15:CoT1: Spell penetration<br>16:CoT: Armour prof: Heavy; STR(18)<br>17:CoT:<br>18:CoT: Greater spell penetration; IC:Longsword<br>19:CoT:<br>20:CoT6: Blindfight; STR(19)<br>21:Sorc11: GrSTR I(20)<br>22:Sorc12:<br>23:PM:<br>24:PM: Epic spell penetration; STR(21)<br>25:PM: <br>26:PM8:<br>27:Sorc: GrSTR II(22)<br>28:Sorc: STR(23)<br>29:Sorc:<br>30:Sorc: GrCHA I(19)<br>31:Sorc:<br>32:Sorc18: STR(24)<br>33:PM: Auto Still spell I<br>34:PM:10:<br>35:CoT:<br>36:CoT8: Auto still spell II; EWF: longsword; STR(25)<br>37:CoT9:<br>38:Sorc:<br>39:Sorc20: Auto still spell III<br>40:CoT10: Epic Prowess; STR(26)<br><br>If you don’t want penetration, use perhaps Extend-, Maximise spell and Armor skin.<br><br>AB: Mundane longsword<br>35/30/25.

The ab isn’t too good, but if you can’t hit, let them hit you with reciprocal shields up. Loads of protection, max spell range for a sorcerer. Can be dispelled, but you have protections from that with mantles. You can even dispel opponents and let them feel your force. You must use spells with no saves for spell attacks, like Ice Storm, IGMS or some bigby’s before you finish with melee. I think most melee and sneak builds will have trouble defeating you. With your immunities and your protections along with damage shields and true seeing, come on and play. He lacks epic spells, but only Epic warding is somewhat useful IMO. Imp-Expertise is there to protect you when rebuffing. Greater Sanctuary to, but it isn’t foolproof.<br><br>He has many immunities from PM levels, plus nice saves vs spells. Even with low hitpoints you should be able to make your presence felt. I hope you enjoy it. It’s unique to, perhaps because it isn’t to good.

It’s unique to, perhaps because it isn’t to good. Using wizard would perhaps be better, I’ll make a try. (quote)<br><br>Now now enough with the pessimism, this build has some great role playing abilities. I dont know much about spellblades but I was thinking that the build is lacking a presence in one sense when it comes to spells especially when half this build is a spell caster. I agree that a wizard would be a better choice due to the feats and a greater ability of versatility. This would increase your feat selection as well. But this will then lower your CoT abilties so the choice is up to what you want for the build. Other than that this build is interesting and well thought.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Jehoshua on 01/15/06 14:47</span></i></p>

Looks to me like a pretty neat build.  A suggestion:  If you shuffle your early feats around (KD and Expertise at lvl 1, WP at lvl 3, WF at 6), you can take WP (exotic) instead of WP (martial), and use a katana or a bastard sword, which do more damage.

Thanks for the feedback. I have built three unique builds lately, all on pure luck, but still they generate very little feedback. Are they so well-planned? I think not. Well well, such is life. <br><br>I like my WF early, but each to his own. 1 point extra damae isn't important, but for style, ok. Though the eastern style doesn't fit too well in DnD, IMO.<br>He has full spell range for a sorcerer, except high CHA, so no use for savable spells. Aside from that, this is quite a powerful combo if you can get hold of DR or healing equipment.
