I devised two ways to go,both with DS at 30th lvl. DS at 28th lvl is possible but it requires Druid 24/CoT 4 leaving just two free lvls which cannot be given to monk according to the rules of your server.<br><br><br>The <b>first</b> stops druid at 14th lvl to get more CoT in Epic for one bonus feat to be spent on something else than GrWIS (Armor skin was my choice). You can move the 6th monk lvl at 27th lvl to set tumble at 30 for +1 AC, at the cost of later KD/IKD. 4 CoT lvls preepic for the full attack schedule. The Disarm/ID line can be nice, your dragon claws count as huge weapons and you get to get the disarmed weapon in your inventory.<br><br><br><b>Druid(14), Champion of Torm(10), Monk(6)</b><br>Human, LN<br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 18 (30)<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 320<br>Skillpoints: 211<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 27/33/24<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +7, Mind Effects: +2, evasion<br>BAB: 21<br>AB (max, naked): 22 (melee), 31 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 28/28<br>Spell Casting: Druid(7)<br><br><b>SKILLS</b><br>Concentration 33(34), Discipline 32(32), Spellcraft 33(35), Tumble 25(25), 88 points leftover<br><br><br><b>LVLUP GUIDE</b><br>01: Druid(1): Expertise, Extend Spell<br>02: Druid(2)<br>03: Monk(1): Lightning Reflexes <i>or</i> Disarm, {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br>04: Druid(3): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br>05: Druid(4)<br>06: Druid(5): Zen Archery<br>07: Monk(2): {Deflect Arrows}<br>08: Druid(6): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br>09: Druid(7): Empower Spell<br>10: Druid(8)<br>11: Druid(9)<br>12: Monk(3): WIS+1, Weapon Focus: Scimitar, (WIS=21)<br>13: Champion of Torm(1)<br>14: Champion of Torm(2): Improved Critical: Unarmed<br>15: Druid(10): Blind Fight<br>16: Druid(11): WIS+1, (WIS=22)<br>17: Monk(4)<br>18: Champion of Torm(3): Toughness, {Smite Evil}<br>19: Champion of Torm(4): Improved Expertise <i>or</i> Improved Disarm<br>20: Druid(12): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br>21: Monk(5): Armor Skin<br>22: Monk(6): {Knockdown, Improved Knockdown}<br>23: Druid(13)<br>24: Champion of Torm(5): WIS+1, Great Wisdom I, (WIS=25)<br>25: Champion of Torm(6): Great Wisdom II, (WIS=26)<br>26: Champion of Torm(7)<br>27: Champion of Torm(8): Great Wisdom III, Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=28)<br>28: Champion of Torm(9): WIS+1, (WIS=29)<br>29: Champion of Torm(10): Great Wisdom V, (WIS=30)<br>30: Druid(14): Dragon Shape<br><br><br><br>The <b>second</b> build, gets two more druid lvls for 8th lvl spells (and spell slots... extended AoV) and Elemental Shapes.

Alright, thanks for the suggestions...I think I will work for the Dragon Shape because not only does it seem potent but the server is an RP server and Dragons would be very fun to RP as.<br><br>Just so I know, what attributes shift over in Dragon Form? Does wisdom affect them once in Dragon Form? Or are all of their stats pre-defined?

Thanks for the builds Kail, as well as the added information. I think I am going to use the build with the extra 2 druid levels for spells (slightly modified maybe)...but out of curiosity, what is the AB and AC, fully buffed and in Dragon Form, of the build with the 2 extra druid levels?<br><br>And if my strength is 10 in human form and it is 48 in dragon form, would it be any different if it was 18 in human form? Would dragon form then have 56 strength?<br><br>And do you recommend this build as a good one for PvP?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Zoodleton on 03/13/06 19:44</span></i></p>

Gah! Um, Kail...I just found out that a prerequisit for Dragon Shape is 18 levels in Druid because the feat requires Wildshape 6 times a day, and that is an 18th level ability I think. What should be substituded for those extra 2 levels?

No, 14 levels are enough, just check the builds, we all use 14 as minimum (of course, don't ask me why, Kail told me), 100% tested, 14 is the minimum, test it yourself using the console if you don't believe me.<br><br>Sure, Kail said something wrong about a dragon, would be nice for a change, nah, you're cool man.

I am dead serious, go look at the feat...it says <br><br>Presrequisits: Wisdom 30, Wildshape 6 times a day (obviously from druid)<br><br>To get 6, you need 18 levels I am positive of that.

Indeed there are many mistakes both in the manual and in the Grimoire. Not even the Wiki is free of mistakes, but at least those are easy to correct. <br><br>Check <a href="http://www.nwnwiki.org/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWN Wiki</a>, it's usually the most accurate of the sources.<br><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.Detail&amp;id=729" target="_blank">The Grimoire</a> is also a good source of information, but double check requirements with the Wiki since it contains many errors.

Alright, one more question...you took Weapon Focus Scimitar when Stregnth and Dex are 10, why not put it to longbow since you have Zen Archery, or even fists since there are monk levels and the dragon fights unarmed anyways, or do fists not count as melee weapons for CoT levels?

WF: Unarmed doesn't work for DS, Unarmed do not count as a melee weapon for CoT/WM, and yes, you need to focus in a melee weapon before you can level up as CoT, so no Longbow for you. Furthermore I don't think the build is proficient with a Longbow until CoT is added.<br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 03/14/06 17:55</span></i></p>

I noticed that in the builds, Improved Critical:Unarmed was taken...is that because it carries over to DS? Otherwise I see no purpose, it would be better spent in a ranged weapon using Zen Archery.

IC: unarmed does carry over indeed. Overwhelming Critical does carry over too, but not Dev Crit. Epic prowess normally applies. Weapon finesse does not, but will with the next patch (1.67). WF/EWF and WS/EWS unarmed, as said, do not carry over (let's hope for a fix in 1.68).<br><br>I chose WF: scimitar but you can pick any melee weapon that you are proficient with. After all it's just to meet CoT prerequisites (still, scimitar is a good choice after all).<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Wait for me Dragon, we'll meet in the sky<br>By fire and magic, I'm sworn<br>Hell is calling, we cannot be denied<br>Fly to the blackness of the Storm<br><br>We must die to be reborn!

It's usually a long way before you get DS, Zen Archery can be really helpful.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 03/15/06 03:33:34 (GMT) -- Zoodleton<br><br>No but as monk I can take martial weapon proficiency and get a longbow, it costs me a feat that could be used elsewhere but it will help the playability of this build until I reach level 28-ish, because throwing darts or using melee weapons with 10 STR and 10 DEX is not appealing to me.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>You might want to consider sling, you can use it with a sling... especially if good projectiles are available.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Wait for me Dragon, we'll meet in the sky<br>By fire and magic, I'm sworn<br>Hell is calling, we cannot be denied<br>Fly to the blackness of the Storm<br><br>We must die to be reborn!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 03/15/06 22:30</span></i></p>
