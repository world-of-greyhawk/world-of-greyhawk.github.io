Another drawback would be lower DCs on spells because the Charisma isn't as high as most other Sorceror builds.<br><br>Still, pretty good.  Since you're counting buffs in, why not add in 4AC from Haste?

I've been playing around with various high-AC templates (I posted one awhile ago).  Assuming that you can buff your DEX to at least 12, and you have +12 of CHA buffs/items, AC is calculated as:<br><br>Dodge Bonus:<br>Mage Armor:      1<br>Haste:           4<br>Epic Mage Armor: 5<br>Divine Shield:   15<br>Total Dodge Bonus: 20 (capped)<br><br>Base:          10<br>Tumble:        8<br>DEX:           1	<br>Base armor:    8	<br>Base Shield:   3	<br>Dodge AC:      20 (capped)<br>Deflection AC: 5 (epic mage armor)<br>Armor AC:      5 (epic mage armor)<br>Natural AC:    5 (epic mage armor)<br>Armor Skin:    2<br>Imp. Expertise:     10<br>Total AC:      77<br><br>However, when caught flat-footed, you lose the following AC bonuses:<br>Dodge: 20<br>DEX: 1<br>Tumble: 8<br>Total AC loss: 29<br>Net AC when flat-footed: 48<br><br>So, the only way to retain that AC in combat is to attack your opponent in melee.  As soon as you use spells, AC drops 29.<br><br>Also, you can use Interposing Hand to gain an effetcive +10 AC vs. any individual attacker.<br><br>I just checked this today, but feel free to cross-check my results.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By MajorJuggler on 06/30/04 21:04</span></i></p>

Ya that seems pretty much it.  Since dodge bonus is negated when flat footed it kinda makes the char useless unless walking away from a fight.  <br><br>I've asked this question many places without getting an answer, but if I was to get uncanny dodge with the rogue levels would that retain dodge bonus as well as dex bonus to ac?

First of all, taking 3 rogue levels will grant you uncanny dodge I which makes all the dodge ac stay. Second of all you are not flatfooted while casting, you just need to be quick to cast the first spell so you can add the others to the list, as long as you have a list of spells on the way you are not flatfooted.<br><br>However I am not positive that you aren't flatfooted the little period of time between casting spells, but if you are the improved combat casting feature will make that problem go away, I'm playing a high magic server with a 38 sorceror/1 monk/1 paladin and If I carefully watch attackrolls when they hit or not hit I can easely see that my dodge ac is retained while I keep casting until everything is dead.<br><br>Hope some of the information is useful <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
