<b>Playable in PvE 1-40</b><br><br>****<br><br>The Brash Adventurer-Hero is sort of a character archetype.  Often a "blue collar" protagonist, one who rises up from the lower rungs of the social ladder via natural talent and courage, the Brash Adventurer-Hero tends to have a problem with authority and usually is found wanting both in terms of social graces and common sense.  Often they tend to get their start by being in the right place at the right time, and being lucky enough not to get killed in the process.<br><br>Far from being a well trained trained warrior, this type of character fights with the aid of natural ability boosted by a fanatical singlemindedness and a burning passion.  Their ferocity and lack of regard for self preservation can overawe their enemies - and sometimes their allies as well! - and fill them with fear.<br><br>However, they are not totally without skill or technique.  A life of adventure gives them the opportunity to develop numerous combat tactics and an eclectic selection of abilities.  However, they tend to have a casual attitude towards danger, and for example don't have a second thought before making noise battering down a door, or of 'disarming' a trap by springing it and relying on luck and talent to avoid suffering negative consequences.<br><br>Story to follow build and FAQ <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>****<br><br>Human, Non-Lawful, Non-Evil<br><br>Str 16<br>Dex 14<br>Con 16<br>Wis 8<br>Int 12<br>Cha 8<br><br>1 Bbn (1):  Luck of Heroes*, Weapon Focus (Greatsword)<br>2 Rog (1):<br>3 Bbn (2):  Iron Will*<br>4 Bbn (3):  +1 str<br>5 Bbn (4):<br>6 Bbn (5):  Power Attack*<br>7 Rog (2):<br>8 Bbn (6):  +1 str<br>9 COT (1):  Cleave<br>10 COT (2):  Improved Power Attack**<br>11 Bbn (7):<br>12 Rog (3):  +1 con, Dodge*<br>13 Bbn (8):<br>14 Bbn (9):<br>15 Bbn (10):  Toughness**<br>16 Bbn (11): +1 con<br>17 Rog (4):<br>18 Bbn (12):  Blind-Fight<br>19 Bbn (13):<br>20 Bbn (14):  +1 con<br>21 COT (3):  Great Con 1<br>22 COT (4):  Epic Weapon Focus (Greatsword)<br>23 Rog (5):<br>24 Bbn (15):  +1 con, Terrifying Rage<br>25 COT (5):<br>26 COT (6):  Epic Damage Reduction 1<br>27 Rog (6):  Great Str 1<br>28 Rog (7):  +1 str<br>29 Rog (8):<br>30 Rog (9):  Great Str 2<br>31 Bbn (16):<br>32 Bbn (17):  +1 str<br>33 Bbn (18):  Epic Damage Reduction 2<br>34 Bbn (19):<br>35 Bbn (20):<br>36 Bbn (21):  +1 str, Mighty Rage<br>37 Rog (10):  Improved Evasion+<br>38 COT (7):<br>39 COT (8):  Epic Damage Reduction 3, Epic Prowess*<br>40 Rog (11): +1 str<br><br>* - Optional feat<br>** - Highly optional but recommended for in-character reasons<br>+ - Rogue bonus feat taken for in-character reasons.

Why not?</b><br>A:  Because AC 5 medium armor (chain, breastplate) +2 dex bonus gives you a base AC of +7 in mundane equipment, which is just shy of full plate armor but weighs less and won't impede any rogue skills you decide to take by much.  The character doesn't really try hard to avoid being hit, anyway - their health and DR is the cornerstone of their physical defense.<br><br><b>Q:  Why COT instead of Fighter?  Fighter would get weapon specialization...</b><br>A:  COT is used for its save bonuses in addition to bonus feats.  Also, the character's concept isn't that of a highly trained warrior with specialization.  The COT levels are meant more to indicate the character's natural luck, and maybe a bit of divine providence on their side at higher levels when they might have caught the attention of a friendly god.  Likewise, if you use charisma boosting buffs or items to employ Smite or Divine Wrath, these can be played as a friendly god's intervention on the hero's behalf.<br><br><b>Q:  You don't make a lot of effort to generate sneak attacks in the build - no knockdown, and no ability to take IKD.  Why take the rogue levels?</b><br>A:  The rogue levels are meant to be used for skill purposes to represent the character's inherent talents (via Evasion for example), and eclectic learning during their life of adventure.  Sneak attacks are a very nice side effect and can add significantly to your damage output.  It's a simple matter to replace a combat feat with knockdown, but starting stats were too tight to fit in IKD.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 10/30/05 22:53</span></i></p>

And the story:<br><br>The town of Northplain was burning.  Smoke billowed up from its houses and shops, even as the clamour of battle raised a cacophany from outside its gates and among its streets.  The horde of monsters, driven into a frenzy of fear and hate by the evil dragon Sharnatharax, had fallen on the city like a hammer blow.  The wall was breached in several places by foul ogres and brutish trolls while guardsmen and adventurers - and even a few brave townsfolk - who had been enjoying drinks in the city's many ale houses fought desperately to contain the battle and push the invaders out.<br><br>The situation was bleak, but rays of hope soon began to emerge as the hardy folk of the frontier city recovered from the initial shock.  A wizard fresh from his apprenticeship unleashed bolts of lightning with a wand he had been gifted by his master when he went to make his way in the world.  A dwarven traveller fresh from parts unknown struck from the shadows, crippling monsters with deadly blows then disappearing again to stalk further prey.  The priests of the town's three temples tirelessly and fearlessly tended the injured, calling on the powers of their gods as they rushed again and again into the thick of the raging battle at great risk to drag out the wounded.<br><br>But it was the tall woman and her enormous sword who charged headlong into the fray straight out of a rowdy tavern brawl - a brawl she had started - that broke the humanoids' main attack and pushed the bulk of the monsters back out of the gate.  With a ferociously determined intensity she shrugged off hits that would have doomed a normal human, and with no apparent thought to her own defense she used her weapon to hack down her foes in huge strokes.  Her seemingly unnatural strength turned even the hardy ogres and regenerating trolls at the van of the monster horde into broken, flying corpses.  Overawed by this display, wondering if they had somehow loosed a demon of battle, both townsfolk and monster fled in fear from the warrior-woman's deadly wrath.  <br><br>Her charge carried her through the humanoids' ranks, leaving death and chaos in her wake, until she had chased the survivors past the city breached walls.  Suddenly a dark shadow fell across the battlefield and blast of dragonfire roared out of the sky at the raging woman - but she had already dove aside, luck and instinct removing her from harm's way.  Growling in anger at the cowardly ambush she rose to her feet and came face to face... or rather, face to shin... with the crimson dragon itself.  Sharnatharax rose to its full, fierce height in front of her and bellowed, a cry that sent the townsfolk, and even many experienced adventurers and veteran guardsmen, scurrying in fear.<br><br>But not the woman, who shuddered in the face of the dragon's ire but stood her ground defiantly.  Mildly impressed, for few mortals could resist the overaweing might of the great beast, Sharnatharax spoke, its voice booming:  "So, you are the one who routed my minions.  Not bad for a human... but surely you see now that you have no hope.  This pathetic dwelling-place of your kind will fall before my unconquerable strength!"  It snorted, embers flaring in its nostrils.  "But you, human, you have... potential.  Make no mistake, for I can crush you with a single claw.  My army is broken... but it is a small thing, and together... ah, together we can work such destruction.  With you as my general we could build an even stronger force.  A legion of fell creatures with you at its head, your position second only to me as we conquer and plunder the Northland."  It smiled, not a pretty sight. "Think quickly, mortal... but keep in mind that the alternative will be your death."<br><br>"So it's come to this," she growled, "A duel with a dragon."  Raising her voice to a taunting, defiant shout, "Well that's just fine by me, wyrm!  You can take your offer and shove it up your scaly arse!  As if I'd ever be the second-fiddle to an overgrown lizard with an overblown ego.  I'll show you a thing or two about alternatives!"  <br><br>Raising her sword, she gave the dragon no chance to reply before taking a mighty swing at its exposed belly, her intensity and singlemindedness causing even the giant beast to pause in surprise.  Dodging and feinting she evaded its deadly breath time and again thanks to her incredible focus and talent, all the while attacking relentlessly with two-handed strokes of her blade, blows that broken through even the ancient dragon's armored hide.  Its claws battered her in turn and soon the combatants were both bleeding from numerous wounds.  Amazed that this mere human had injured it, let alone was still alive, the still-confident Sharnatharax made a mistake.  <br><br>Its great head lashed towards the warrior with razor-toothed maw agape, who bravely - foolishly - held her ground.  And swung her sword up to meet the dragons attack with a shout of fury, resulting in a clash that echoed for what seemed like miles.  The female fighter was thrown back by the impact, landing yards away in a heap, barely moving after the epic battle.  But Sharnatharax, the crimson wyrm of the north, had misjudged the heroine's near-insane focus and recklessness.  It was the beast's last mistake in its eons-long life, a mistake it didn't even have the chance to regret as it crashed to the ground with a greatsword driven through its skull.<br><br>The warrior-woman's wounds were grave, and it took her several days to regain consciousness.  The grateful townsfolk took her in, the best healers available tending to her many injuries.  A great feast was planned for her honor as soon as she woke up, with the Viscount of Northplain (who had hidden in his Keep's wine cellars during the fight) intending to bestow on her a knighthood in his fiefdom.  But as soon as she could walk, she was gone, leaving the town with all its honors and rewards and titles behind her without a thought, taking only what she had brought with her and without ever even telling them her name.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Solid build and solid tale to boot! Well done.  I have nothing to remark about the build itself.  It's fine just the way it is.  These are the characters that I like to roleplay--strong, daring, resourceful, robust, good saves.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

This build seems to remind me of my favorite fiction character. I think the build is a good blue print for Conan the barbarian. It's a barb and rogue which he was and in the books he was favored by his god Crom so cot could be coc lol.<br><br>            Nice Build!!<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick. Long ago I learned to strike swiftly and without scruple. I trouble no man without cause, but one who attacks me had best resolve himself to die!

This is good. A build that has abilities and skills based around rp (or rp based upon skills) is good to see.<br>Not to many people who does that anymore.<br>It's a solid build to. Barbarians do not come into their best in a high powered world. Let's hope for the future(NwN2?) that rage bonuses will go above Stat caps!<br>Again, rp-based build, good and good!<br>and anice story to go.

This is something of an old build, but I'm trying to design a Barbarian, Rogue, Cleric with similar play philosophy, and I'm wondering why Barbarian 21 was taken.  I haven't tested this, but my understanding is that even though Mighty Rage lists Barbarian 21 as a requirement, Barbarian 20 will also work.<br><br>Thanks for the help, and I always love your builds, Xylophone.<br>_________________<br>There's always time to procrastinate.
