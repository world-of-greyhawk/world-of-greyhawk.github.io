<b>Playable from level 1-40, PvM build.</b><br><br>Not designed for power gaming (so every flaw actually is a design decision).<br><br>Kensai are also known as 'Sword Saints', warriors who have been specially trained to be one with their swords.  They are deadly and fast and trained to fight without encumbrance.<br>(from the BG2 kensai description)<br><br>I'm thinking about (and playing) kensai-like chars (single weapon, no shield, no armour) for a while now and this is the build I like most (but I'm not 100% happy with the levels past level 24):<br><br>Monk(13), Fighter(8), Weapon Master(19), Human<br><br>STR: 14 (26)<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 14 (16)<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 10<br><br>Hit points: 474<br>Skill points: 247<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 28/27/25<br>BAB: 28<br>AB (max, naked): 44 (melee), 31 (ranged)<br>AC (naked): 27<br><br>01: Monk(1): Dodge, Mobility, (Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist)<br>02: Monk(2): (Deflect Arrows)<br>03: Fighter(1): Weapon Proficiency Exotic, Weapon Focus: Katana<br>04: Fighter(2): STR+1, Expertise, (STR=15)<br>05: Fighter(3)<br>06: Fighter(4): Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack<br>07: Monk(3)<br>08: Weapon Master(1): STR+1, Weapon of Choice: Katana, (STR=16)<br>09: Fighter(5): Weapon Specialization: Katana<br>10: Weapon Master(2)<br>11: Weapon Master(3)<br>12: Monk(4): STR+1, Improved Critical: Katana, (STR=17)<br>13: Weapon Master(4)<br>14: Weapon Master(5)<br>15: Monk(5): Blind Fight<br>16: Fighter(6): STR+1, Called Shot, (STR=18)<br>17: Monk(6): (Knockdown, Improved Knockdown)<br>18: Monk(7): Toughness<br>19: Weapon Master(6)<br>20: Monk(8): STR+1, (STR=19)<br><br>Basically Blind Fight, Called Shot and Toughness could be replaced with other feats but imho these three feats are the best choice. Blind Fight helps vs. enemies with concealment, Called Shot is great vs. hard hitting melee fighters and we really need the additional hit points from Toughness because our armour class isn't that great (depends a little bit on items though). However if you want to go for Devastating Critical you may want to take Power Attack and Great Cleave. However I don't like Dev. Crit. very much. Overwhelming Critical would be okay but the char is already very powerful vs. everything not immune to critical hits so an additional 2d6 damage wouldn't make a big difference. Power Attack would be nice perhaps but you can't have it all - take it instead of toughness or instead one of the optional epic feats if you really want.<br><br>The seventh Weapon Master level is delayed to maximize saving throws. The eighth monk level gives +1 to all saves (basically the luck of heroes feat), the sixth fighter level gives +1 to reflex/will saves but the seventh WM level would not increase any save.<br><br>21: Weapon Master(7): Epic Weapon Focus: Katana<br>22: Monk(9): (Improved Evasion)<br>23: Fighter(7)<br>24: Fighter(8): STR+1, Epic Fortitude, Epic Weapon Specialization: Katana, (STR=20)<br><br>So far I'm very happy with the build but since all the important feats are taken already the build seems to level up without a real goal to achieve... more monk levels would give better AC, more weapon master levels would give higher AB and more fighter level would give more bonus feats (could be used for Power Attack for example). The monk levels at level 27,32 and 37 are to maximize tumble (for +1 to AC)  but everything else could be changed.<br><br>25: Weapon Master(8)<br>26: Weapon Master(9)<br>27: Monk(10): Great Strength I, (STR=21)<br>28: Weapon Master(10): STR+1, (STR=22)<br>29: Weapon Master(11)<br>30: Weapon Master(12): Epic Will<br>31: Weapon Master(13): Armor Skin<br>32: Monk(11): WIS+1, (WIS=15)<br>33: Weapon Master(14): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=16)<br>34: Weapon Master(15)<br>35: Weapon Master(16): Epic Prowess<br>36: Weapon Master(17): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=24)<br>37: Monk(12)<br>38: Weapon Master(18)<br>39: Weapon Master(19): Great Strength III, Epic Toughness I, (STR=25)<br>40: Monk(13): STR+1, (STR=26)<br><br><br>Skills: The skill selection reflects a little bit the picture of a kensai I have in mind.

As a weapon master she's pretty good versus everything not immune to critical hits but even immunity to critical hits usually is no problem (at least once she reached level 24 and with a good weapon - despite her somewhat low armour class and with only 1d4 acid damage on her weapon she did not need a heal potion when fighting Mephistopheles in HotU - Called Shot turned his AB into that of a goblin). She has some problems vs. powerful spell casters. She really sucked vs. Heurodis in SoU - the first char who died in that battle (never thought that would be possible), and she couldn't kill the maker in HotU at level 20/21 - at level 24 and with slightly better gear it was no problem. <br><br>Combat Tactics: Improved Knockdown helps vs. everything not immune or with low discipline, Called Shot is great vs. hard hitting melee fighters (it seems there is no immunity, only discipline helps). She can try to reduce the enemy's AC using the taunt skill and if nothing else works she can unequip her weapon and with a her stunning fists (DC 12/22/33 at level 1/20/40) she can try to stun the enemy (good chance on low levels - has worked on J'Nai in SoU, later vs. powerful enemies the chances aren't very good). Problems start once just bashing the enemy is not enough. She can't protect herself against spells, however improved evasion and decent saves help a little bit. She has some spell resistance (23) but that's good only vs. low level casters.<br><br>On low levels and if no good robes are available she could switch to armour/shield - nothing she prefers but better than dying of course.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.Detail&amp;id=856" target="_blank">Character Build Calculator</a>(works with Excel, Open Office) 2.83: updated to NWN 1.69.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 08/11/05 15:56</span></i></p>

Kamiryn, just wanted to comment that this is a pretty decent build.  Balanced, playable, and personable.  I like it just the way it is.

I like this build a lot.<br>Looking it over I might make the following changes.<br><br>Drop Weapon Proficiency exotic, and take power attack in its place.  Change Weapon Focus, specialization, improved critical, and weapon of choice to great sword.  (I'm envisioning a no-dachi)  This will net you the great swords better damage mod.<br><br>If you change all Weapon Master levels after 10 to fighter you will pick up 1 more feat which could be great cleave.<br><br>You end up losing one point of AB for increased damage potential.<br><br>If you were willing to drop the spell resistance (is it really all that usefull, at that level?) you could change your last level from monk to fighter and net another feat which could be overwhelming critical.<br><br><br>I might also try to factor a couple of points of craft weapon into the mix.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kalisman77 on 08/09/05 02:44</span></i></p>

This is to make it more playable if you are playing ground up.  Plus, without Armor and shield he needs all the help he can get.  SR at that point is gravy.

Just an interesting side note, when I was poking around with NWN Explorer I noticed that the weapon master is often referenced as kensai, supposedly they changed the name during development.

I always thought the kensai should be dex based or at least 'balanced'. Unfortunately all the weapon I have in mind for the kensai aren´t finesseable. Other weapons I had in mind were longsword (similar to katana but doesn´t require the exotic feat and it doesn´t look as good as katana) and quarterstaff (no-one uses staffs and often the weapon type is neglected by builders). <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;If you change all Weapon Master levels after 10 to fighter you will pick up 1 more feat which could be great cleave.<br><br>You end up losing one point of AB for increased damage potential.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I´m afraid I would lose more than that. The magic numbers for weapon master are 7,13,16,19,22,25,28.

Another possibility is to take 16 monk levels (+1 to AC, +5% speed, higher SR, 1d20 unarmed damage - never disarm the kensai <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> ) and 16 WM levels (-1 AB, -22 hitpoints). One could increase strength at level 32/33 instead of wisdom and one would end up with the same AC/AB.

My mistake, it's been awhile scince I have played a weaponmaster.  I had forgotten that the docmentation that came with the game was incorrect.  I was thinking the bonus from superior weapon focus was every 5 lvls.<br><br>I would also state that from a role playing standard would probably only take greatsword in a CEP module.  Where I could have an oriental greatsword.

Why not use kamas. Flurry of Blows would still be useable and you would get the monks unarmed attack bonus, which would add +9/+6/+3 to it's attack bonus and 1d12/1d10 to it's damage. This would be beneficial because of it's relatively low ab. =:
