Tell me or one of the other moderators the playability range/category and we'll edit it in. I remind you and everybody else that it is a requirement to have it indicated.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail

Av: Neat concept! To bring up your damage, I'd have to agree with Finn - swapping COT for FTR; true, cot's have great saves, but FTR brings in the AB &amp; damage (WS/EWS). <br><br>Another suggestion would be to drop SD for Rogue, for all that great sneak damage and also stealth. If your worried about saves, bring up your monk levels: they've some awesome immunities, great concealment. If you want to keep monk where it is, then def go for rogue  over the SD. OH, btw, I like the ninja, too - really, really neat! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>Tyr<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Robert Tyr on 06/07/06 21:48</span></i></p>
