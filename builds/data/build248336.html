Well done, Kail (as usual - and great to see from you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">      )<br><br>On a quick review, I don't see anything that seems to require strength, so wondering why not go dex-based here instead, since you're using a short sword (which qualifies for weapon finesse), and thus can max out hide &amp; m/s with fewer skill points, allowing you thus to max out UMD, too (such an amazing skill it is, as I learned from ya <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    ) I know, dex base hurts the damage factor, but you've  some nice spells to compensate for that (plus, you've UMD, spells, and also some cool buffs too, yes?). Rangers gets some really neat stuff, and the rogue (plus the HiPs) is a great touch: that sneak of yours in the second version, the first is also cool, but the second, look at all that sneak damage! Now, that's some hurt: COOL (love it!). <br><br>Just a thought; and either way, Kail, great build, as usual, and so good to see you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">      <br><br>Oh, and so folks can see what it is that the ranger does get: <a href="http://www.gamebanshee.com/neverwinternights/spells/rangerlevelone.php" target="_blank">Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/31/06 04:24</span></i></p>

What's the point of DEX, I have to ask? A ranger can stealth good enough, and it's all about damage. You might go DEX and give up some playabilty, but rangers definetly works better with Strength.

OF COURSE str works best for damage <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Me only point there (and just a though, eh?) was that, at the end of the post, Kail was musing about dropping an AB in exchange for more skills; my idea would have netted a few extra skills, at least to max out UMD or something, without having to drop an AB -- indeed, would lead to serious reduction in damage, and with all that stealth anyway, ... and yeah, rangers be neat; totally! Just a musin', and once again, with so many of 'em and all that great sneak, well, for sure, 'tis a great build

DEX route is possible of course, but you'll want minimum 13 Rogue levels since you'll be aiming for ED. Rogue 16 would be needed to get in Crippling Strike too and that means losing 2 Ranger's bonus feats.

I've always liked my rangers strength based too.  I feel like the 3e and 3.5e rules (1D8 hit dice!?!) have significantly wussified them. Anyway, nicely done, I prefer the Ranger 29 variant as well.  The only variant I would suggest is that I might drop wisdom by two and raise intelligence by the same so I could pick up another 43 skillpoints, and pick up IKD so I can get more use from my sneak attack.  But you lose two levels of ranger spells.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

more ranger the better, in my opinion.  go with 29.  and dropping the strength for a little boost to skillpoints and hp is the way i would go.  i just hate to have a ranger you can't stand in for a bit of melee.  and when you go strength, you gotta melee. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>general applause all around, i think.  <br><br>-cs<br>_________________<br>“If you bring a Ranger with you, it is well to pay attention to him...”

Yeh, they get 6 skill points per level, HiPS (level 17), Evasion (level 9), and a choice to go Two Weapon Style (Imp TWF at level 6) or Archery style (some pansy bow feat at level 6) in the 3.5 rules. The FE damage is nerfed though, and there are a lot more FE categories, so your FE bonuses don't kick in on as many opponents. So yeah, they're still wussified - almost as much as any non-Dwarf character. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Anyway, nice builds Kail.

I'm not a professor like the rest of you here, but in my opinion you should go 14str,14dex,14wis (you need that much to get all the spells),14int,con14, you only lose 1AB and thats not all that much since you'll gain more hps and skillpoints.<br>Think I prefer the v.2, always been a fan of SA. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br>You could even drop two Grt str feats for 2 ISA (if you have the opportunity to do so). Will give you more damage vs non-sneak immune folks, specially vs other players.<br><br>Nicely done, and its always nice to be an inspiration, or at least make others think.

I see both build as viable and IE from the second one is sweet with a lowish ref save and a low bonus to saves vs spells. The increased +2d6 sneak is not bad either and 1 less FE can be quite acceptable depending on the environment. Again, environment dictates choices.<br><br>As I said in the OP, going STR 14, INT 14, CON 14 is probably the wisest choice. When I built it I automatically went for 16 STR being this a STR build, but when I was revising the build for posting I realized that going 14 STr meant losing just little (-1 AB/DMG and some carrying capacity) but getting back +40 HPs, +1 Fort and +43 skillpoints (the latter the sweetest). <br>Personally I wouldn't want to lower WIS and lose 3rd and 4th lvl spells.<br><br>IKD is a must IMO if going with the latter stat spread, I agree. Called shot is a nice feat but it can be dropped.<br><br>Again thanks to all for the feedback.
