What if you took off toughness, knockdown, divine shield, and extend spell and went for dev crit?  I suppose you'd need to mess around with the stats a bit.  Your str gets +8 from the rdd so you could add 3 points into str to get 26.  Then for cha you get 2 points from rdd, 7 from lvls, and 5 greater cha for 28.. with +12 cha items or spells(you can get +9 from spells alone) thats +15 divine dmg.  You could switch armor skin for divine shield if you like the higher but temporary ac.  Just some suggestions..

Hey lala,<br><br>It is funny how we seem to be designing similar characters.  Great minds, i ugess  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   .<br>   I had an idea for pal 29/s1/rdd10 as well.  My design uses the great smite feats to about great smite 5 i believe, ending with a charisma of 27 vs 30.  I also added the dev crit to mine, so by dropping that I could conceivably get to 30 charisma and/or great smite 6 or so.<br><br>Otherwise, nice build.  I would like to hear you're opinions on great smite.<br><br>Peace

I play a very similar char on the PW im on but i took bard instead of Sorc, this did require alignment change but worked well in the end.<br><br>Pally 28/bard 2/RDD 10<br><br>Bard was taken at lvl 21 and 40 (to max out tumble for AC) although i believe you take first bard lvl earlier if u wanted.<br><br>Just my thoughts
