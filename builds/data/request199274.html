This obviously is a Bard archer. <br><br>BG can give you use poison, bulls str, dark blessing, smite good, summons, inflict wounds etc., turn undead/divine might and sneak attacks. <br><br>To make a build, you must decide what to focus on. <br><br>You can go heavy dex or cha and you can focus on any of the 3 classes.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

So it can be wise not to end up with an even number of AA levels.<br><br>Bard has a wide selection of class skills, so it should be easy to plan the skill progression.<br><br>You get turn undead at BG lvl 3. If you can get a divine feat at the lvl you get turn undead (correct me if I'm wrong), you don't need more than 3 BG lvls to take e.g. divine might. I think DM is better than DS in an archer build.<br>Have you considered taking Cleric to get the divine feats?<br><br>The Bull's from BG and Bard stack and give you a nice damage bonus with mighty bows. You need str 13 to get cleave (for BG)<br><br>I'd take bard at least to lvl 20 for LI and have at least Cha 16. If you buff with eagle's and carry Cha items, Divine might can give you a nice extra against otherwise immune opponents.<br>If you intend to rely more heavily on the divine feats, I'd take Cha higher. That will also make a better saves bonus if you take BG lvls.<br><br>You can use both elf and half elf. Elf has better Dex but worse Con. If you take BG before AA, the half elf will get weapon prof martial and can take WF longbow to qualify for AA.<br><br>example feat progression (lvl 1-8 Bard)<br>1 Bard, point blank shot<br>3 Bard, power attack<br>6 Bard, cleave<br>9 BG, WF longbow<br>10 AA<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

You should also take into account the fact that Arcane Archer gets epic bonus feats at level 14, 18, 22, 26, 30.  So it's in fact not necessarily true that stopping at an odd level is the best thing to do, if one more level gets you another feat.<br><br>Steve
