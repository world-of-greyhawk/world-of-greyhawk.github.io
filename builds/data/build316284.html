The halfling bartender standed behind his desk and was busy cleaning his mugs. Not many people were around in the Tavern, the hour was still early and most people came by at an later time. His daughter the waittres was mopping the floor and his two sons were back in the store house. After some time people began streaming in. Rough loudy men who laughed and drunk alot in the night to get home and find their wives standing with a club in the doorway. The elven bards entered the stage and began playing some good old timers. The people were cheery and sung along with the music. <br>Suddenly the door slammed open and in the doorway stand Gart and his band of outlaws. "Hail they good people we come for some feasting and drinking! Come on now dont be shy! Please continue the music! The bards who had paused for a moment looked at each other shrugged and went on playing. The barkeeper who hat seen the men thought: 'here comes trouble,.....good!' He waved his daughter and some of his other waitresses. "Tell the boys Gart is here and they be ready to get here as soon as possible. The girl walked through the back door.<br><br>Soon after just as the barkeeper expected Gart was already making trouble. "Dont be shy now lass. We just want to have some fun. Come sit on our table and tell us your name." The girl struggled to get free from the firm grip on her arm. "Sir, pls let me go. I have customers to attend to." One of the more daring customers who was known for his many barfights called Big Bill stepped forward and sayd: "The girl told you to leave her alone!" Gart turned to Bill: "Or what?" Bill rolled his muscles. "Or there be trouble." Gart laughed and soon Bill lay on the floor unconsious with a bloody nose and a black eye. "Hey you there! No fighting here! You have violated a customer of mine and now you get your sorry *** out of here!", the bartender yelled furious. <br>Gart and his band looked at the small red face of the barkeeper and laughed at him. "Im not joking! If your not leaving i call my sons." Gart with a big grin on his face sayd: "Call them then! They cant be much bigger then you are! Hahahaha!" "BOYS!! KICK THAT SCUM OUT HERE!" Right after his bark two young halflings appeared beside there father. The bandits looked at them and this time they rolled over the floor banging fists on it. "Whaahahaaha! They are just kids and their arms are as thick as broom and they are not even carrying and weapons or armor like we do!" The two boys and halfling twins looked at there father and he nodded. <br>At a tremendous speed the two jumped at the bandits.<br>Punches were dealt, teeth were flying through the air (along with bloodspatters), screams and whimpers of pain were heard. One flew through the window, another landed on a table full of beer which all went to pieces, one bandit got a wine crate on his head which he now was carrying instead of a helmet and so on. <br>At the end the bandits lay all unconsious and broken all over the tavern. Gart spitting teeth and blood looked at the two. "Who are you guys?!" The boys looked at him with big cheery eyes and huge grins on there faces: we are The Two Tavern Twins!<br><br>Builds that are similar to these two builds include:<br>(Rog 10 / Mnk 12 / Clr 18)<br>--

has more skillpoints (UMD).<br>- gains more spellslots and a 1 ab and damage bonus with the Divine Favor spell.<br><br>Benefits of both:<br>50% speed bonus.<br>25 SR (not great but better then noting).<br>33 SF DC which is 39 max.<br>good ac.<br>decent ab with both.<br>monk unarmed damage combined with WS and EWS or sneaks.<br>6 attacks around.<br>Empowered healing.<br><br>Trickery is also a good option for both.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 05/27/10 21:02</span></i></p>

I like these builds (for PvM). Nice work, however, I'm pretty sure similar builds have been posted before. You should look them up and post links and preferably compare  them  to your own build.<br>_________________<br><i>Ghaash agh akûl - Nazgûl skoiz<br>Mirdautas vras!<br>Karn ghaamp agh nût<br>Shaut Manwe quiinubat gukh</i><br><br>Summoning - Mirdautas Vras

*hands FinneousPJ a very good cookie* <br><br>There that's how you encourage someone to keep posting builds.
