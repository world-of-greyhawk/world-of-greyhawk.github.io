Ok first I hardly know anything about monks except what I've read in the wiki or asked on the forums. That said...<br>From the wiki:<br>A Monk that focuses on Improved Spell Resistance can become almost untouchable with spells. With a spell resistance of 67, a Monk will be completely safe from any spells that allow resistance cast by a level 40 caster.<br><br>Is this only possible with a pure monk, or can a monk multiclass and still hit that 67? And if so how?<br><br><br><br><br><br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/07/07 05:44 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   I just care about killing first.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Monk Spell Resistance is 10 + Monk levels. You can take the Imp SR feats on Monk levels as an epic Monk for +2 to your SR each time. So, to get 67 SR, you need some combination of up to 10 Imp SR feats and Monk levels. So 10 Imp SR feats (+20 SR) + 37 Monk levels (47 SR) = 67 SR. Leaves you 3 levels for multiclassing.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Note also that some spells, like Evard's, ignore SR (Evard's can be avoided by having small size, or a small size form).<br><br>Edit: Note also that having 37 monk levels and SR of 67 means all general epic, and monk class epic feats will be ISR feats, leaving only 3 levels of another class for any other epic feats.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By WhiZard on 02/12/08 01:27</span></i></p>

I think Creeping Doom and Earthquake are the best spells that ignore SR.

If you're looking to build an SR monk, and presumably to PvP it, 64 SR is more than enough.  It would be pointless to try to go higher, as you'd pretty much destroy any chance of having a well-rounded character for little or no gain whatsoever.  Only a really, really bad player would make a pure level 40 mage or sorceror with all the spell penetration feats, and expect to pvp it.  <br><br>I don't know how to put links into posts, so here's a copypasta link to an SR monk I posted awhile back.  It could probably be tweaked to whatever your persistent world is.<br><br>If you have any questions about it, feel free to ask.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "289829", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Oh, how nice.

I forgot the natural Monk DR, right, spells don't breach any DRs... and actually Earthquake is pretty useless too since it allows a Reflex save (against a Monk with Improved Evasion <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> ) but it's still about the only damage spell that breaches SR.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Aiming for super-high SR is a specialty build. You can become a mage-killer, but it costs you the ability to be good at anything else.<br><br>I prefer to aim for SR in the mid-40's. You can get that while still taking 5-10 levels of other classes, and spending most of your feats on EWF, EP, Great Str/Great Dex, etc. and have both a good melee build and enough SR to be a problem for builds that aim to beat 32 SR from items. You won't be immune to spells from the near-pure mages, but neither is anyone else. You will still be dangerous to them with your speed and SF/IKD (if you run in and IKD them before they get their TS/Bigby's off, they are dead), you just won't be a "mage-killer". You will also be useful in general melee.<br><br>TM
