Saw the sinister dwarven lord and thought I'd make an evlen version. Main questions I have for this build:<br><br>1. With Divine Might, is a higher charisma better?<br>2.

You should type out the actual classes in the topic, imo, and not just un-decipherable abbreviations ._.<br><br>How curious... you're burning most of your Blackguard bonus feats on EPIC TOUGHNESSES. What for? Do you realize that boosting constitution would give you a bonus to fortitude saves as well as HP? Besides, if you start with only 12 constitution you get +80 HP immediatly! I would personally drop the Wisdom score to 8.<br><br>Delay the 2nd Shadowdancer level to maximize Tumble at 40 ranks.<br><br>And then, why Elf? Why 16 dexterity? Make him, dare I say it, human <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  <br><br>Finally about the strength/charisma. I don't like going beyond 20 with charisma. It's useless if you have 36 AB, and can't hit anything, no? Usually I make my strength 26 and then see what can I do to make the charisma score better -- 16 is sufficient, 18 is nice, 20 is heaven.<br><br>I think you have some serious tweaking to do. I'm quite busy now (then what am I doing here you might ask. No idea. Don't worry, I'm going now <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ), sorry if I'm now help and just making you angry with my comments <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>EDIT: typos, that's what happens when you're busy <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif"><br>_________________<br>&lt; XmikeW&gt; im glad though.. i used to think that -all- finns were supersmart nerds.. but, after seeing 1) (C) law ..2) your culture minister ..and 3) the äm-irk girls... i can say that you guys are definately typical human beings after all [smile_:-)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 12/05/05 18:27</span></i></p>

Finn raises some legitimate concerns:<br><br>He doesn't really have a way to improve his AB other than with a Bulls Strength.  And, unlike a Paladin/CoT version, he doesn't really any other way to raise it.  He doesn't have UMD, spells, Songs, Epic FIend, Epic Prowess, Armor Skin, etc.  The 26 Charisma is admirable, but to go so deep with the Charisma and not have Divine Shield is a bit problematic.  His Smite is of limited value since he only has one, and even that is only against someone else who is evil.  The Ranger adds some interesting features, but I wonder to what extent it is of value given only the 10 levels and 5 point investment for a 13 Wis.  <br><br>The Shadowdancer might be better replaced by Assassin5 and by dropping 3 levels of BG.  While you would lose HiPS and a BG bonus feat, you would gain 2 pre-epic feats, UMD, Darkness (to go along with ultravision) and 3d6 more sneak.  It would also give you the capacity for a bit more balance in Epic for Tumble, UMD, Stealth drops.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
