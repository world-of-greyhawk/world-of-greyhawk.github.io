Heyya. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   <br><br>I play on a roleplaying server called Storm Nexus. I /really/ need help with a build. Here's why:<br><br>My main character is in a Realm called Horus, a Daemon Realm (No not tieflings, actual Demons), one of our members killed an emissary from another Realm, the Sis'Ralar, a Lizard-folk, elves, Nature lovers Realm. Now the Ralar want Genocide on the Daemons. I don't want that to happen, I love playing a Daemon. Its pretty interesting.<br><br>Here's a little bit about the server and what's going on:<br><br>Immunity to Knockdown and Fear items <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">   <br>Haste Boots at level 7, (Except for monks. . .)<br>You can craft your own items, add damage to a weapon up to 2d10, except for Divine, Magic, and Negative. Those only go to 1d4.<br>High PvP, but there are certain rules.<br>Good Roleplaying, actually, its enforced.<br>We will be fighting a group of mainly Arcane Archers and a few Fighter/WeaponMaster/Rogues.<br><br>Here's what I need if anybody has any ideas so far:<br>High AB, pretty good AC, and be able to knock the crap out of mostly anything. The Race needs to be either Human, Elf, or Halfling. I just change the subrace to Daemon.<br><br><br>Thankee lots! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   <br><br>-Elee<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Elee_Alera on 05/29/06 22:24</span></i></p>

I know you think you have given us enough info, but the info you have given isnt nearly enough..   or somethin like that!  <br><br>I commend you for asking us for advice in the right forum, but it can be very hard for players unfamiliar with all the intricacies of your pw to give adequate build advice.   Also, depending on how you play there are too many options.  If it is straight pvp that you are looking for, exalted sorc is always a nice option.  The only real flaw with that is the LG alignment.. i couldnt see a demon being LG, but thats me!<br><br>Peace

Oh... hehehe, well, Classes and alignment really doesn't matter on this server, its all about how you roleplay your character. But, how I play? Heh, anyway that I'm able to. <br><br>And... how much more information do you need? <br>Here I was thinking that was too much.<br><br>The character can be a paladin, champion of Torm, etc., because as I said above, Class and alignment doesn't matter.<br><br>Face to face PvP? Yes, I need a build that someone would make for a PvP server, straight up <b>kick you in the face til your eyes bleed</b> build. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> ?<br><br>Let me give you the link to the Forums for Storm Nexus if you're really interested in helping me, (Which I hope some of you are, if not, shame on yew for not helping a fellow NwN player. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> ).<br><br><a href="http://forum.stormnexus.org/" target="_blank">http://forum.stormnexus.org/</a><br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">  Lesse. . .<br><br>It doesn't matter what the build is, as long as it can take down Arcane Archers and Figter /WeaponMaster/ Rogue. . . Along with various other druid builds. The Arcane Archer builds, 60% of them us Rogue / Wizard/ ArcaneArcher. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif"> <br>The rest are either Fighter /Wizard/ ArcaneArcher or the basic Ranger /Wizard/ ArcaneArcher.<br><br>The one I'm most worried about is a half-elf, Rogue /Wizard/ ArcaneArcher.<br>Mind you, this server you can get "ascentions", when you reach 40th level, instead of having a billion 40's running around, you can post a subject on the Forums for a character ascention, you'll be given 10 points each ascention, then 20 the next, and so on respectivly. You can get certain feats for a various amount of points, same with ablities, skins, voices, wings, tails, etc., now, I'm not sure which feats/ablities this character I'm worried about took on her ascentions, or how many ascentions she has had. My guess would be, from what I've seen her do and heard, she has taken feats for hiding, move silently, and probably put points to get some extra points in Dex as well. <br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_sleep2.gif">  <br><br>Hmm.. <br>My character, sadly, hasnt had any ascentions, I keep remaking her. ^^; So I don't get the in-your-face extra feats and all that good stuff.<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">  So, is that enough, or do you need more? I can give you lots. <br><br>Thankee again. <br><br>By the way, on the SN forums, my user name is Turtle_Wings.<br><br>Why I put that, I'll never know. . . <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">

Hm, a good weapon vs AA's is the Epic-dodging monk. That means high dex, plus eother SD or rogue. SD would get it fastest. Then you really need to hit something, I think Cleric for the last class. Take enough monk to max your unarmed damge and get empty body, plus enough Cleric to max many buffs.<br><br>I would propose Monk18/SD5/Cleric17, or even Monk20/SD5/Cleric15. You won't be knocked down because of the immunity, and then DEX-builds are quite fine. Not many feats to play with here, though.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

I might consider Monk 30/SD 5/Fighter 5 also - lets you get the 6th attack per round, a few bonus feats (including WS/EWS), and ED. Human or Dwarf for no XP penalty. This will also have slightly higher AC than the Cleric version, but no buffs. Depending on your items and party members, either may be the better choice.<br><br>TM

If the magic level is very high, I wouldn't recommend a buffing Cleric. You're better off with a WM, or anything that has <b>high unbuffed AB</b> (because you'll be buffing it with items at that point, and a Cleric has low AB generally).<br><br>Say, a Cleric has 40 AB unbuffed. His max is thus 66, which he may reach with only his spells. Actually, he will <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">   Now, a WM might have about 50 AB unbuffed. He gets his +10 weapon and +12 STR. There's the 66 AB. However, he still has another +10 that can be boosted by his party members and whatnot. So, build a WM.<br><br>Cheers <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"><br>_________________<br>"...<br>C'est un pays plus nu que la terre polaire<br>— Ni bêtes, ni ruisseaux, ni verdure, ni bois!<br><br>Or il n'est pas d'horreur au monde qui surpasse<br>La froide cruauté de ce soleil de glace<br>Et cette immense nuit semblable au vieux Chaos;<br>..."<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 05/30/06 16:02</span></i></p>

If it's very high magic I recommend an RDD, since you get a pretty good unbuffed AB due to the excessive strength, and don't have to spend as many feats as a WM.<br><br>Maybe bard/blackguard/RDD, those kind of builds work really well for me in high magic environments.  8/22/10 and 11/19/10 for example of level splits that have worked well for me.<br><br>If you do want to go WM, fighter/COT/WM is probably a good bet, or fighter/BG/WM (to get sneak damage).<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Thankee to all for the ideas. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  They all sound really great, I'll have to look into them.<br><br>I forgot.. Knowing my brain, it's nothing new, the DMs banned SD. ^^; It's in the script, you can't take it. I find that very stupid... The mages, I have one myself, have epic summons, instead of the Mummy and DragonKnight, they get Greater Dwarven Creation and an Uber one... Ultimate Dwarven Creation with 3k+ HP, Paladin 30, Fighter 20. It only last two minutes though, but dear Lord.. That thing is totally kickin'. I don't think its really fair though, the Mages get Uber summons, along with cleric, but the Rogues, Assassins, get crap, they FINALLY put in a rogue shop. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">  Big thing too, there are a lot of rogues that were complaining about not having good traps, and that they couldn't find the components to make traps...
