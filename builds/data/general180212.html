When I read some of the builds on this forum, some say to reroll to max HP per level.  Since I'm pretty new to NWN, I have no idea how to calculate what the max HP is.  Any build gurus willing to create a table for CON vs HP for a newb? Or at least point me to a thread where it tells you how to calculate HP? I can't seem to find it for some reason.. but then it could be that it's just 4am here.  =:p<br><br>Thanks in advance.<br>_________________<br>NW

A table would be a waste of time. Take the hit die for your class. Let's say it's monk, which has d8. So take that number 8. Add on your con modifier (con minus ten divided by two, rounded down. eg con 15: (15-10)/2=2.5, rounded down is 2). Then, if you took the toughness feat, add that in too. Epic toughness doesn't add in, that's just a +20 one-time thing.<br>So, the formula, again, is:<br>hitdie+con mod<br>and add one more to that if you took toughness.<br><br>So for our monk with 15 con and toughness, the max is 8+2+1=11.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By yrtsns on 02/10/05 14:57</span></i></p>

It also helps to know that at level one and two, you roll your max hp.

I gotta add this:  I was looking at a build, Im sorry, i dont remember who originally did it, but it is the High saves dwarf defender build (very sweet build i might add).  There were some things I noticed about max HP/level up when I designed my version (was trying to find the max HP of the build).  Here it goes:<br><br>When you take the feat TOUGHNESS, the max HP for that one lvl is something like this  (using monk, with 14 (+2) con)...  say you take it at lv 12: 8 + 2 + (1 + 11) = 22 max for that lvl.   What this means is, you get 8 max die roll, 2 for con bonus, 1 for toughness for lv 12 and 1 per lvl lvls 1 to 11 (11).   Then when you take lv 13 your max HP is 8 + 2 + 1 = 11 per lvl (if nothing else changes).<br><br>NOW, here's where it gets fun and amazing! (at least when it comes to maxing hp, as i understand it).  When you take a con stat point at lvl up (either feat or skill) you MAY have an increase in the stat modifier.  For example, if you have 15 con and you take a stat point, you get a modifer +3 for 16.  BUT, if you have 14 and you take +1 con to get 15, it changes nothing (hence the uselessness of wearing +1 striders low lvl with a con of 10! Oh the silliness we do as rookies <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">  <br><br>I am really only a beginner with this, so if you see an error here, PLZ point it out.  I am working on a bard/pm/rdd build that goes from a con of 14 to 21 and takes 22 lvl of pm (which is a class all to itself in max hp, at least i think LOL) and if my  math is correct i should see a few lvls where i can get to 31 max hp per lvl <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      Not in the realms of the defender, but not too bad for a human.<br><br>Oh, and i should add, toughness DOESN'T add after you take lvl, the bonus hp is in the roll.  SO if you take the skill and settle for an 8 on a d8 max (0 con bonus) you are not getting use of the feat.  SO keep that in mind when you are going for max hp per lvl. <br><br>LOL im sure this is all long and drawn out, and someone has a mod that does this for you, but I like figurin things out the long way.<br><br>As you will note, this is edited!  After i posted i was testin my pm/rdd/bard build and at lv 12, taking rdd7 (2 con) +1 con for lv 12, moving my con from 15 to 18 (+2 to +4) i was expecting to get around 36 hps.  Sadly, for some reason, the rdd stat increases did not influence the hp roll.  So what i was rolling was from 15 to 16 for a total of 24 hps. (10 +3 + 11), but for total HP, the extra 12 hp for the extra +1 to con modifier was added to hp total.. )  OMG it gets confusing LMAO<br><br>Hope that helps.  I learned alot (2nd edit <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  )<br><br>Peace<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 02/11/05 06:59</span></i></p>
