I was thinking about doing a druid/bard/pm mix using the dragon form to do a draco lich.  Now this would be possible but will it be useful?  The pm levels would be 10+ for the immune to crits and ac bonus.  But would this dracolich have enough AB to hit anything?  I have made a some druid/monk and druid/shifter/monk  dragon form characters and while they had great ac  and insane hp they had trouble really doing much damage.  Or does anyone have a better dragon form character that has a high ab that doesn't get dev crited all the time?

He's got a Druid 15/Cleric 15/CoT 10 that gets something like +79 AB.  Although it's a bit munchkin for my tastes (doesn't really seem very playable), it is nonetheless a strong build, especially with the Great and Epic Fort feats.  <br><br>Alternatively you could take Monk rather than CoT, and sacrifice some saves for a boatload of AC, or you could take Rogue and get tons of skill credits and a nice boost to damage.  <br><br>If you're not stuck on dragon build, you might try something like my Deathless Archer or Deathless Master builds.  These are both 21st lvl Wizards with 10 PM levels, which of course make them immune to Dev. Crit, but they're still moderately effective in combat.
