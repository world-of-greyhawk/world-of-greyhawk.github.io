You cant , you need to take some levels of an arcane class to qualify for palmaster (needs 3 levels wiz/bard or sorcerer).<br><br>Syrath

20 palemaster tends to be a bit restrictive (some ac bonus; but two levels where you will get none).  <br>16monk pre-epic<br>4 bard pre-epic<br>[the above assumes a melee character; your base attack will be identical to 20 monk levels pre-epic]<br>19 palemaster [get epic mage armor and warding, if desired]<br>1 bard (max umd; tumble)<br><br>Or not; I'm not good at the building thing, still learning myself.

If you took wiz level instead of bard you would be able to cast spells up to a level 11 wizard if you can get the scrolls to memorise. Bard is probably better though (UMD you can cast any scrolls)<br><br>Syrath

My favorite Monk/PM goes like this:  14 lvls Monk, 5 lvls Wiz, 20 lvls PM, 1 lvl monk.  I prefer Wiz over Bard for the extra spellcasting ability, besides you get tumble as a Monk class skill as well as Bard.  You don't have the max ab possible with this build, but you will have pretty good AC, not to mention epic spells.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

Only issue with the Bard is that it would require an alignment shift.  Monks have to be Lawful; Bards must NOT be Lawful.  So unless you have a way to shift along that axis, I would go with Wizard instead. <br><br>As for Monk 20/Wiz 4/PM 16, you can certainly do this; you'll be able to get Epic Spells and up to 6th lvl arcane spells, but you'll only have 4 caster levels, unless the world you're playing on has fixed the PM caster lvl bug, or unless you're playing with the PrC.  <br><br>I would probably go Monk 20/Wizard 10/PM 10, as this will give you a decent caster level and let you cast up to 8th lvl spells.  Monk 18/Wizard 12/PM 10 would let you get 9th lvl spells, which are nice, but then you would lose 1 point of BAB over the previous build.  <br><br>Also, if you decide to take a decent # of Wizard levels, I would pick up the Extend Spell feat so that your buffs will actually last a while.
