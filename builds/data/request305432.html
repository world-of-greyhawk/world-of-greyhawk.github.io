I found this using pulse caps, but the only problems i see with it is slightly less average ab and no spell penetration feats, worried that igms and other spells will require a mords to become efective which is one action too many in combat. I understand that it's a spell sword but having decent ab and spell pen would be nice. <br><br>The build is by yrtsns<br><br>Phase-Kill: Ranger 9 / SD 10 / Wizard 21<br><br>Race: Elf<br>Starting Stats (Ending Stats)<br>STR 10<br>DEX 18 (26)<br>CON 11 (12)<br>WIS 11<br>INT 16 (19)<br>CHA 8<br><br>1 Ranger-Weapon Finesse, Favored Enemy: (your choice, I prefer human)<br>2 Ranger-<br>3 Ranger-Dodge<br>4 Ranger-+1 Int<br>5 Ranger-Favored Enemy: (your choice, I prefer elf)<br>6 Ranger-Mobility<br>7 Ranger-<br>8 Ranger- +1 Int (dex hereafter)<br>9 Shadowdancer-Improved Critical: (your choice, I prefer rapier.

WebShaman and/or Kail will tell you to use a MMM (Multi-classes Melee Mage). Wizard 35/Ranger 2/Assassin 3 is a build I have been messing around with. <br><br>If you are wanting to use Wizard or Sorcerer for your Spellsword (without the PRC) you pretty much have to sacrifice something, or we'd all be playing them.

Well, for spellswords I think Paladin 7 / Sorcerer 23 / Red Dragon Disciple 10 is great. It gets high STR, saves and BAB somewhat decent, plus Sorcerer for spells, but it matures quite late. <br><br>Fighter instead of Paladin would make it easier on your feats to take Improved Two Weapon Fighting, and you could get Epic Weapon Specialization, but you'd lose some saves.<br><br>9 levels of Ranger is a good way to take Improved Two Weapon Fighting, but I believe Fighter and Paladin give you better benefits.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
