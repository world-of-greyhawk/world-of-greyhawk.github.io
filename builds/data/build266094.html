DRAGON RIDER (the “Mighty Blade”)<br>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar<br><br>Concept: <br>Dragon Blades were an elite fighting force, comprised of combat warriors who actually rode and fought upon dragons; the pair, rider and dragon, were dedicated to the preservation and defense of a far away land, somewhere in the desert. It is said the bond between dragon and his/her rider is a strong and magical one. It is also said that, in time, the bond grows between a rider and his/her dragon, such that they begin to “see” and “think” as one, and that each of the pair eventually take on many characteristics of the other. It is widely believed all Dragon Blades (and their dragons) died out during the time of the dragon wars. <br><br>They are wrong: a few survived. <br><br>Character:<br>This character is a “mighty” variant, if you will, of my original Dragon Blade, and thus asks: Want more mighty in your rage and EDR damage-shrugging power in lieu of magic in your rider? Then this, the third and final character in my latest Dragon Blade series, may be your ticket! Inspired by Grim (whose helpful comments and review are graciously acknowledged), this dragon rider comes complete with high AB (self-rage to str. cap, no assembly or equipment required), serious HPs (over 800 raging!) –and- EDR II (or III), bolstered by a terrifying rage DC 57-66. <br><br>Others in the Rider Series:<br>If you want more magic/bardic song power instead, then you be seeking the Magical Rider,  <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "266095", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>     , with much more bard than has this one, thus a much, much better song (and level 5 spell access), being also a more “magical variant” (if you will) of the original Dragon Blade. To see the original Dragon Blade (with links therein also to the 11 other cool builds, being “others of the species” using this splendid class combo, including Finn’s most clever “Mighty and Terrifying and Thundering Gnomish Barbarian” which. albeit different, shares the same level split as this one), <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "264359", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> <br><br>And now, without further ado, please meet: <br><br>DRAGON RIDER (the “Mighty Blade”)—<br>Barbarian(28), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Bard(2)<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Any Non-Lawful (Theme: Chaotic Good, Chaotic Neutral, or Chaotic Evil)<br><br>I.

Wow, Thax -- I feel your pain! (Ain't those options just a <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">              <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">             <br><br>Yeah, the extra 3/- from EDRIII would be nice, (would add up to 15/- as opposed to the current 12/- s/he's got (ie, being 6/- from epic barbarian DR and 6/- from EDRII, &amp; not the 10/- as currently posted (sorry folks, edit's a comin'); and, uh, in the meantime, don't ya feel a li'l better knowin' there's another 2/- ? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">              <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">           <br><br>Seriously though, great eyes and great call re: dwarf, which would indeed let you do it all, just like you said; unfortunately, also bang on as to why I didn't go that route - i.e. serious xp penalties, which would (for many players) hamper playability. Then again, if picking it up from level 40 .... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">             <br><br>Conversely, if playing this up and yet really wanting that extra 3/-, while by no means integral, you should (always) feel free to adjust, taking whatever's most important to your style/environs. Highly effective w.o, I assure you; but Thax' be some great thinking, too (&amp; spoken like a true dragon - thanks!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 02/16/07 18:37</span></i></p>
