On the October listing of indexed builds the following of mine were included:<br><br>Hidden Magic Elf<br>Outside the Natural<br>The Dragon Prince<br><br>Currently the Jan listing now only displays these two<br><br>Hidden Magic Elf<br>The Dragon Prince<br><br>Since the October listing but well before the January I also proposed Strength Smotherer.  Is there any reason for the non-inclusion? Are there builds of other people that also were not included?<br><br>Edit: Note: I do not know the status with pulse cap search, but none of my builds appear there.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By WhiZard on 01/31/08 08:48</span></i></p>

Reason is, I suspect, human error. Pulse cap has been MIA for a while from what I gather - the NWN2 search engine doesn't show lvl30 builds at all?<br>_________________<br>" -- They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then it's night once more."<br><br> - Pozzo in Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett

Pulse Cap's engine has not been updated in a long time.  His program does not do a dynamic read of the data, he has to update his end with the current entries.  I've spoken to him about it.  <br><br>I'll look into why there are missing entries on my end.  I've automated the process and did notice that the count was lower, just didn't know why.<br><br>thanks
