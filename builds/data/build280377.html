It was a serious question, not just because I like the Druid's Companion or anything, I really don't know which would win or why, I know the PM gets nice summons on later levels, but I just never played a heavy PM and probably never will... about the summoned undead DRs, I don't know how much DR the PM summon gets, if it's a Demi then its resistance must be high, but Elder Alhoon I haven't the slightest idea, Greater Magical Fang might not be enough to breach... I'm not sure, a bear companion gets a very decent amount of damage and AB but lousy AC.<br><br>The thing is such a heavy Pale Master build seems to depend too much on his summon as I see it.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

It's true that a Pale Master heavy build depends on it's summoning skill.  But, that is the essence of the class.  Summoning Undead to fight for you.  Other people tend to take it up to level 10 and stop, or to get the epic spells.  A true PM is a naughty summoner at heart. His offensive spells will always be his secondary means of attack (as I see it).  This build keeps that in mind, and adds traps + HIPS for extra survival.<br><br>It's true that a Wiz Ro PM build would have better trap skills, but then you'd loose HIPS and that is a hard pill to swallow.<br><br>No HIPS on your server?  Don't use this build.<br><br>This guy would summon his minion and buff it. He'd keep him off to the side (behind some traps). His trick would be to lure things into it the traps, then unleash his pet on them.  He'd HIPS to avoid combat and attack from a distance via wand/spells/items.  Maybe he'd keep healing his minion via Healing Kits while Hiding.

Sure thing WIzard in epic gives better choices for bonus feats, but what do you want BAB for? this is not a melee, even with low caster levels this is still a caster build, so caster levels pre-epic make it more playable.<br><br>And what Cinn said.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

I guess the theme of this build was a high level PM.  Being a PM means you have to find an avenue to do damage.  His spells will never be up to par, so he might as well buff the summons.  Traps are a good avenue and HIPS is always useful.  His Craft Wand skill will help him throw many more lower level spells around.  Melfs for instance or a wand of dispel magic.<br><br>This isn't the super end all PvP build that everyone seems to want.  It's simply a high level Pale Master who has skills to fall back on, geared towards a persistent world.

To what extent are PM summons subject to Dismissal, Banishment, and the like?<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Same as any other summon which is, total.  Not only that, they can be turned because they are undead.
