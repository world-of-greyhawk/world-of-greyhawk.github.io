Hey guys/gals.  I just realized that the old forum where i put all my delicious prc builds is no longer.  I thought i'd put them here to preserve the carnage builds.<br><br>Most of these are Hospitaler builds.  Being a cleric lover, i soon fell in love with this class.  For those who arent aware, it grants caster lvl per hospi lvl, so you never loose out on caster lvl, and it is very similar to COT!  So you get the best of both worlds.  <br><br>I already posted my rager/ld here and the Ultimate cleric, so i wont repost.  THat just leaves...

Posted: Sat Oct 20, 2007 7:05 pm    Post subject: the Secret Dev Crit Dragon    <br><br>-----------------------<br> <br>Hey all. wzd gave away the not so secret secret that you can get dev crit with a dragon. It isnt easy, but it can be done! wzd and I talked about one version way back in early 2007, iirc. His version is a Half orc, but I worked out a version with human to illustrate the idea. <br><br>human <br>str 18 wis 17 con 9 rest min <br><br>d druid b brawler cot champ of torm <br><br>01 d1 power attack/ cleave <br>02 d2 <br>03 b1 weapon foc: unarmed (creature, given free  ) <br>04 d3 s19 <br>05 d4 <br>06 d5 extend spell <br>07 d6 <br>08 d7 s20 <br>09 d8 great cleave <br>10 d9 <br>11 d10 <br>12 d11 s21 improve crit: unarmed <br>13 d12 <br>14 d13 <br>15 d14 practisd spell caster: druid <br>16 d15 s22 <br>17 d16 <br>18 b2 weapon foc: longsword <br>19 b3 <br>20 cot1 s23 <br><br>21 b4 great str I/ str II s25 <br>22 b5 <br>23 b6 <br>24 b7 w18 overwhelm crit <br>25 b8 devastate crit <br>26 cot2 gr wis I w19 <br>27 cot3 gr wis II w20 <br>28 cot4 gr wis IIIw22 <br>29 cot5 <br>30 cot6 gr wis iv/ v w 24 <br>31 cot7 <br>32 cot8 gr wis vi w26 <br>33 cot9 gr wis vii w27 <br>34 cot10 gr wis viii w28 <br>35 d17 <br>36 d18 gr wis ix w30 <br>37 d19 <br>38 b9 *tumble 40 dis 40 <br>39 d20 DRAGON SHAPE <br>40 d21 s26 (max lore spellcraft) <br><br>With half orc, you would have an experience penalty as brawler and druid are both NOT free classes for HO. The key to this is Brawler. It seems that brawler gives you a BONUS! When you take wpn Focus:unarmed, you get a nice surprise. THis allows you to get OC and DC in the same surprise. <br><br>The HARD part of playing this type of build is that it is min/maxed stat wise AND the feats are extremely tight. That said, this version does end with wis 30 and str 26 to get dragon shape and dev crit, with max tumble! and discipline, which are very nice to have on the mountain. <br><br>----- <br><br>WHat follows is what I have figured out, and in some ways is a better variant to the above. <br><br>THere exists a class called Initiate of Draconic Mysteries. While this class gives you Dragon shape with only 10 levels and seemingly NO wisdom commitment, it would be very easy to get dev crit with this class alone! The thing is, and this was confirmed to me by stardawg, iirc (i met him in game on thurs night if my memory serves, and today it isnt!) the dragon shape given with iodm is lesser than the one given with 30 wisdom. It seems to be weaker and not as hardy overall. I started to wonder about using this class to get 30 wisdom Dragon shape. <br><br>The class appears to have some nice things going for it. Unfortunately, in game, it doesnt appear that the increase in damage dice applys (if I am wrong, let me know. I am refering to it working with 30 wis dragon though). Improved evasion would be great, but this required a 6 level commitment. I weighed the pros/cons, and liking the tumble for free, I decided on only 2 lvls. I still get evasion which is nice. <br><br>I was looking at cot vs hospitaler, but I was wondering about killing stuff with so limited a number of shapes for most of the characters life. Hospitaler (and YES, this is my 3rd time using this AMAZING class) gives us access to important gr wisdom feats (like cot) BUT it also gives CASTER LEVELS!! Oh, and Heavy Armor too (allowing us to ONLY need to get dex to 12 for full armor bonus). Leaving this character with 38 caster levels! Almost as good as full druid! NOTE: DO NOT TAKE PRACTICED SPELLCASTR:DRUID, apparently there is a glitch to having 40 caster levels with that feat, and you dont need it! <br><br>Druid is the only regular class, so see, NO exp penalty. Getting to 16 druid early gives us 1 ele shape. This will help making leveling easier with DR and such. Having 19 druid levels at the end gives 3 ele shapes, which is tolerable. You will have 3 dragon and 3 eles. <br><br>The cool thing is getting dev crit at 21! YES, POWER BUILD. Using half orc it can be done. Taking 2 gr wisdom feats at lv 24 gets you lv 9 spells early too (comparatively!). <br><br>Without further ado, here is Myth. <br><br>half orc <br>s 20 w 16 i10 d8 ch6 con8 <br><br>01 d1 power attack <br>02 d2 <br>03 d3 improved unarmed strike <br>04 d4 s21 <br>05 d5 <br>06 d6 weapon foc: unarmed <br>07 d7 <br>08 d8 s22 <br>09 d9 cleave <br>10 d10 <br>11 d11 <br>12 d12 s23 improve crit: unarmed <br>13 d13 <br>14 d14 <br>15 d15 silent spell <br>16 d16 s24 <br>17 h1 <br>18 h2 alertness <br>19 h3 great cleave <br>20 h4 s25 <br><br>21 h5 oc unarmd/dc unarmed <br>22 iodm1 [creature] <br>23 h6 <br>24 h7 gr w1/2 w19 <br>25 h8 <br>26 h9 gr w3 w20 <br>27 h10 gr w4 w21 <br>28 h11 w22 <br>29 h12 <br>30 h13 gr w5/6 w24 <br>31 h14 <br>32 h15 w25 <br>33 h16 gr w7/8 w27 <br>34 h17 <br>35 h18 <br>36 h19 gr w9/10 w30 <br>37 d17 <br>38 iodm2 <br>39 d18 DRAGON SHAPE <br>40 d19 s26 <br><br>BAB is 26 (4apr) <br><br>Skill points is the tricky part.

Unfortunately, these will HAVE to be raised with tokens, but what else do we have tokens for!! <br><br>one last thing. At lv 22, taking iodm will grant CREATURE too. SO you will automatically have dev crit with ELe shapes, badger shape, bear, wolf or whatever you decide. <br><br>So, that's it. Have fun, if you dare. <br>----------------------<br>note: the server this was designed on had a token system to allow you to add stats and stuff to master items.  So you could add up to 60 in a skill if you wanted to.

I thought that hospitaler class was something about hospitals! LOL my bad. It turns out that that is what they are ENTIRELY about! Putting people into the hospital! or morg. <br><br>This build came about after a conversation with Stryder about one of his clerical builds, although this idea is mine. <br><br>The rundown on his: 4o divine caster lvls (undispelable), 4 apr with a bab of 27, implosion dc of 55, with epic spell focus in evo and necromancy BOHT! Plus some nice aoe spells, like Creeping doom and has access to empowerd blade barriers for the nasties. <br><br>Basically, he is a caster, and a pure caster at that. The normal feat progressions indicate this. The bonus fighter feats from hospitaler pre epic give this build weapon focs, cleave and improve crit! WOW! In a pure caster, these feats are considered novelties, yet with this guy, we have no other real choices (i guess blind fight, but we are a cleric! ) <br><br>so,without further ado, here is my cleric <br><br><br>Race Human <br>Alignment Neutra Good <br><br><br>STR 14 <br>DEX 8 <br>CON 12 <br>WIS 18 (36) <br>INT 12 <br>CHA 8 <br><br>Leveling <br>01 cleric1 D2 L4 spell foci : evo/necro [trickery/plant] <br>02 cleric2 L5 <br>03 cleric3 D3 intuitive attack <br>04 cleric4 w19 <br>05 cleirc5 D4 <br>06 cleric6 extend spell <br>07 cleric7 D5 <br>08 hospitaler1 w20 <br>09 hospitaler2 Great spell foci:evo <br>10 hospitaler3 weapon foci:morningstar <br>11 hospitaler4 <br>12 hospitaler5 great spell foci necro/power att w21 <br>13 hospitaler6 <br>14 hospitaler7 cleave <br>15 hospitaler8 silent spell <br>16 cleric8 w22 <br>17 cleric9 <br>18 cleirc10 empower spell <br>19 cleric11 <br>20 hospitaler9 improve crit:morningstar w23 <br>21 heirophant1 esf: evo / spell pwr +2 <br>22 heirophant2 spell pwr +4 <br>23 heirophant3 spell pwr +6 <br>24 heirophant4 esf: necro/ spell pwr +8 w24 <br>25 heirophant5 spell pwr +10 <br>26 hospitaler10 <br>27 hospitaler11 epic wpn foc: morningstar <br>28 hospitaler12 w25 <br>29 hospitaler13 great wis I w26 <br>30 hospitlaer14 great wis II w27 <br>31 hospitaler15 <br>32 cleric12 w28 <br>33 hospitaler16 great wis III/ gw Iv w30 <br>34 hospitaler17 <br>35 hospitaler18 <br>36 hospitaler19 great wis V/gw VI w33 <br>37 hospitaler20 <br>38 hospitaler21 <br>39 hospitaler22 great wis VII/ gw VIII w35 <br>40 cleric13 w36 <br><br><br>Skills <br>on cleric levels/heirophant levels, take Lore, Spellcraft, then COncentration (fill this out later) <br>on Hospitaler levels, Discipline, Lore then Concentration. <br>end skills concen 39 Discipline 42 Lore 43 spellcraft 43 <br>HP 360 max <br><br>AB 52/47/42/37 w/ mundane morningstar <br><br>Saves <br>Fort 24 <br>Ref 15 <br>Will 33 <br><br>Please note about the AB.

It is advisable to have a +10 morningstar though, to cut through DR (thanks buddy for that one).

I didnt even take my own advice! In my original build (the one im playin thru) I took emower at 15, and silent at 18.. dont do that! Take it like i posted it here. Silent is sooo nice to have those extra undead to death spells one lvl higher, and now, at lv 17, it would be great to have destruction one lvl higher too, just for lvlin fun in the grassy area.

Posted: Sun Nov 04, 2007 3:11 am    Post subject: The LAST DIVINE TEMPEST    <br><br>-----------------------<br> <br>Hey all. k, I promise that this will be the LAST of the Hospitaler collection that I started. <br><br>When I originally looked at the nurse, i did so strictly to make a cleric caster with offensive threat. The Nurse is the result. <br><br>When I played the nurse, although it was strong, I didnt like having to hack it out with the Formian wizards.. oh boo hoo, right! LOL So by using the same class combo, but twinkin the leveling, I created the BEAST! And, if I do say so myself, he is very nasty. <br><br>THen theres the now famous Dev crit dragon, using Druid with hospitaler. <br><br>I started to realize how diverse and POWERFUL this class actually is (hospitaler). imvho, having played with it alot, i can see it being probably the most powerful single class in the game (when mixed with cleric ESPECIALLY!!). <br><br>When Gaz added some new prcs i looked at them all and the only one that jumped out at me was Tempest. SO the first experiment with it was a fighter/wm/tempest build. It is a very powerful combo, but I love clerics, so i thought about what a tempest would be like with cleric buffs and offensive magics. <br><br>The first combo was cleric15ftr tempest, which didnt meet all my likings. The caster lvl was too low, I didnt have access to lv 9 spells. Things like that. <br><br>So i thought, hospitaler??? And low and behold, it worked! I know people have told me (folks I truly respect) that when they have done dual wpn builds they ended up with a board most of the time. 13 shield AC is a hard thing to pass up. Ill run it down quickly though, to help see, it probably isnt that bad  <br><br>First, the build has 28 caster levels. THis gives you EPIC spells (mage armor, warding, storm mantle are the important ones (thanks stryder and drakky)) <br><br>Then we get extended Imm to crits (it is dispellable, but just barely). <br>Being a cleric, we get blades, firestorm, sov and mass heal, heal and harm. THese are the main OFFENSIVE spells that any cleric must have. <br><br>The ab for the build is 41 with mundane kukris, with 4 apr. with +10, you easily top off the 20 cap (5 div fav, 3 div power, 2 battletide, prayer, aid or what have you). thats 61 BOTH hands, and it is SUPPOSED to work that you get 4 off hand attacks too! 8 apr with 61! *faints* <br><br>Did I mention, DEV CRIT! Though you get it alittle late (lv 26), though not too bad. <br><br>AND, for the cool factor KUKRIS!! <br><br>NOW, for those that are gonna try to say POWERBUILD, look closer. YES, all this above is great, BUT this build is NOT for the faint of heart. To get the stats right, you end up with very few skill points (8 int and cleric skils = crap). The only skills you can take are Dis 5(10 points) to qual for Hospitaler, lore 33 (epic spells) and Spellcraft (to get epic spells). You will HAVE to use tokens to get more spells and qual for storm mantle. You will also need tokens for concentrate and dis (40 con 90 dis should be good). Again, this is a concept build and is NOT for the beginner (do BEEST if you are lookin for a great beginer build). <br><br>Here he is: <br><br>Lord Laufslot <br>human <br>str 18 wis 14 con 8 dex 15 int 8 char 8 <br><br>01 c1 D2 power attack/ cleave [trickery/knowledge] <br>02 c2 <br>03 c3 D3 weapon prof: exotic <br>04 c4 s19 <br>05 c5 D4 <br>06 c6 weapon fic: kukri <br>07 c7 D5 <br>08 H1 w15 <br>09 H2 extend spell <br>10 H3 AMbidex <br>11 H4 <br>12 H5 s20 improve crit:kukri/ twf wpn fight <br>13 H6 <br>14 H7 Dodge <br>15 H8 mobility <br>16 H9 s21 Spring Attack <br>17 H10 <br>18 T1 great cleave <br>19 T2 <br>20 c8 s22 <br><br>21 H11 great str I s23 <br>22 H12 <br>23 H13 overwhelming crit:kuks <br>24 H14 s25 gr st 2 <br>25 H15 <br>26 H16 DEV cRIT: kukri <br>27 T3 gr wis I w16 <br>28 T4 w17 <br>29 T5 <br>30 T6 w18 gr wis II <br>31 T7 <br>32 T8 w19 <br>33 T9 epic wpn foc: Kukri <br>34 T10 <br>35 T11 <br>36 T12 s27 gr st III/ PERFECT TWF <br>37 H17 <br>38 H18 <br>39 H19 Epic Prowess/ Armor SKin <br>40 c9 s28 <br><br>AB 41/36/31/26 off 41/36 <br>+10 kuks 51/46/41/36 <br>AC 20 with mundane studed leather <br>AC with all buffs (ema20, nat 10, def 10, dod10) 70 <br>for 25 ref 17 will 24 <br><br>WIth cleric you can buff up dodge 10 more (uef and lv 2 spell) to get 80. I would keep a board around (+10 tower) for those times when you are against crit immune things or hard hitters (ie BOSSES). that will give you 93, if my math is good. <br><br>Remember, with cleric you get +10 to ab and at least 10 to damage for a few casts! <br><br>So thats it (for now). Enjoy
