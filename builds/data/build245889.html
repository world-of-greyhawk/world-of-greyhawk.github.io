Finny's Fave, huh? Love these character-types, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">      You seem to have a thing for those alignment changes, but, no matter, I likes him. Similar to my DS Bard, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "245660", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> (except I've only 1 alignment change (LG to NG), higher AB (note: smite bonus also not in there, nor did I take it to the cap), higher HPs and also some more combat damage output), but the saves and AC are similar. Your AB's still decent, though (40's nothin' to sneeze at, and then you've some nice buffs, and access to a few more bard spells than does mine <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  Oh, but those skills of yours - very, very nice, Finn - not exactly worried about bein' knocked and such, are ya? Also, the listen skills - not much if at all gonna get past you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  Cool!

as to suggestions <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      <br><br>Only thing I'd add is the HP thing; you're on the line, even with bard song; not a "daisy-sniffing, poem-reading weakling[]" or anything, but still . . . <br>I'd be inclined to drop yer AB (-1) for the +40 HP boost, as you suggest as being an option; this, since you've yer bard buffs and taunt also to rely on (which folks should not understimate! Those bard buffs, plus song and curse, just does a character good!(yeppers, although the extra alignment change does hurt, it's another bard-pally-RDD, with a wonderful assortment of skills; just makes me wanna sing or flap the wings around, ya know?! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>ps. btw, so everyone's clear on this, with high level bard song/curse song, that's ESF: Taunt-plus in and of itself, and w.

With the skill focus, party on for sure <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">         (and, oops, this would be my 4th post but hey, those skills are his schtick....Toughness, hmmm. Good idea, Thax: that would work; but I wouldn't drop a skill focus for it though; armor skin seems to be a better candidate (ie., high bards get good song (+5 AC) and good curse (-2 to enemy AB thus in turn +2 AC), so AS isn't really necessary: he'd get more HPs while keepin' his unbuffed AB at 40 where it is; that's good thinkin' (yep, would def. help out a party, but he has a special knack for sneakers it seems (with ESF listen, he can hear 'em a mile away and, with good fort, curse, song and bard spells, + other stuff, esp.

Yo, peeps! ( <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">  )<br><br>Nice to see four out of seven replies are by TyrTemplar <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>I'd like to note that the ESF concept isn't my own, I copied it from my other favourite build, CD's Skillful Minstrel <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   I've been playing that build for a year now, and it never gets old. The version I'm using is the Bard 26/Fighter 4/RDD 10, and like a week ago I figured why not change FTR for something else? First I made him with Bkg - that's where the name really comes from - but I didn't like having to pick Cleave, and there are already numerous builds like that posted. So, I changed it to Paladin <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   He's still a fallen Paladin so it's not so bad...<br><br>As for the HP, I think 400 isn't bad for a 26th level Bard. Besides, where I tested this (PvM), the toughest meleers have "only" 57 AB (IIRC) -- they can't even hit me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   And that's the case with most opponents, I'd say; even most WMs have trouble hitting this guy (they tend to have ABs in the low to mid 60s, and I can Curse them). A WM will probably need a roll of 15 or so to hit me, and that with 50% concealment is good protection.<br><br>If you don't have to worry about Dev Crit where you play, Epic Fortitude would be my first choice for dropping too.<br><br>Cheers<br>_________________<br>"We keep our Feast of Feasts, sure of our bourne,<br>                 Our aims self-same:<br>The Guest of Guests, friend <i>Zarathustra</i>, came!<br>The world now laughs, the grisly veil was torn,<br>And Light and Dark were one that wedding-morn."<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 07/05/06 16:44</span></i></p>

Listen on human ? Either take spot or go elf , no sneaks isnt true with listen, everyone with a ranged weapon can still hit you flatfooted and get sneaks in.
