Here is a character I recently took through HotU (well not quite as that ended with a single monk level at level 27). I had staff as weapon which of course isnt the most powerful choice. Kama or Great Sword is better but staff looks cooler. The character isnt very powerful but I enjoyed it as it felt well rounded. Also I couldnt find a single character with these class combos in the search engine (maybe for a reason...)<br>Anyway, here is the build.<br><br>Monk18/CoT8/Dwarven Defender14<br>Dwarf<br>Alignment: Any Lawful<br>Playable 1-40, PvM<br><br>Str16 (30)<br>Int10<br>Wis14 (18)<br>Dex14<br>Con16<br>Chr6<br><br><br>1 Monk, Toughness<br>2 Monk<br>3 Monk, Dodge<br>4 Monk, Str17<br>5 Monk<br>6 Monk, WF<br>7 Monk<br>8 Monk, Str18<br>9 Monk, Blind Fight<br>10 Monk<br>11 DwD1<br>12 DwD2, Power Attack, Str19<br>13 DwD3<br>14 DwD4<br>15 DwD5, Great Cleave<br>16 DwD6, Str20<br>17 DwD7<br>18 DwD8, Imp Crit<br>19 DwD9<br>20 DwD10, Str 21<br>21 CoT1, EWF<br>22 CoT2  Great Wis I<br>23 CoT3<br>24 CoT4, Epic Reflexes, Great Wis II, Str24<br>25 CoT5<br>26 CoT6, Great Wis III<br>27 CoT7, Great Str I<br>28 CoT8, Great Wis IV, Str26<br>29 DwD11<br>30 DwD12, Great Str II<br>31 DwD13<br>32 DwD14, Armor skin, Str27<br>33 Monk11, Great Str III<br>34 Monk12<br>35 Monk13<br>36 Monk14, Great Str IV, Str29<br>37 Monk15<br>38 Monk16<br>39 Monk17, Epic Prowess<br>40 Monk18, Str30<br>_____<br>AB: 41/36/31/26, 41/38/35/32/29/26<br>AC naked: 29<br>Hit Points: 552 <br>Damage Reduction: 9/-<br><br>Fort: 31 (33)* (35)**(39)***<br>Will: 32 (34)* (36)**(40)***<br>Reflex: 30 (32)* (34)**(38)***<br><br>*Defensive Stance bonus<br>**Defensive Stance and Dwarf Hardiness bonus<br>***saves vs spells with Defensive Stance and Dwarf Hardiness bonus <br><br>Discipline: 43(53)<br>Spellcraft: 20 <br>Tumble: 40<br>Heal: 5 (9)<br>Lore: 1<br>Heal: 2

I would make a few minor tweaks.  Swap Dwd10 and CoT1.  You lose +1 to Will and Fort, but you gain +2back in Fort and Reflex.  I'd also take Armor Skin at Level 21 with CoT2 and a Great Strength.  Instant AB and AC at the same time.  As for Power Attack and Great Cleave, I question if there aren't better feats than this.  Granted, he's a monk.  I don't have a problem with using a sword or a staff in a monk build.  I tend to do weird things like that, too.  <br><br>I also noted that you had this<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Heal: 5 (9)<br>Lore: 1<br>Heal: 2</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>You devoted points to Heal twice.  Probably a typo.  I haven't seen other builds like this, which seems a bit strange.  I suppose you could swap CoT for Fighter in the Epic Levels.  Get an extra feat out of the deal, and you'd get to throw in WS/EWS, but I like how CoT is used here.  Overall, I think he's pretty solid strength-based monk.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

The heal and lore thing is a type yeah. <br>Cool thing about taking CoT 1 before DwD 10 giving better saves. It is the little things! <br><br>I thought about fighter but I wanted a combo of three good defensive classes and I also wanted the wisdom from CoT.<br><br>About great cleave. I guess it is because I mostly play PvM and great cleave can be very useful when there are plenty of monsters around. For fewer bigger fights I guess it might not be very useful, especially since you get cleave for free. Maybe could try dual wielding and go DEX instead, but then going DEX and not getting epic dodge doesnt feel right...
