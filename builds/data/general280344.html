Something that's been bugging me for a long time.  It seems a LOT of repeat questions/answers could be forestalled if these forums included the "inside forum" search capacity that it seems every other forum around has.  There are SO many times I would like to search past forum questions and responses for some tidbit of information rather then having to post a new topic thread.  I know a lot of this stuff has already been covered a gazillion times.  And when the newb posts the rehashed question again, someone can do a quick search and just say "click here".<br>Is there something I'm missing???  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">

Well, in my experience, the forum searcher is hell crap, (I just hope I don't get punished for flaming the searcher, but it really is useless).<br><br>When you have a doubt you make a question, as simple as that, normally if someone posts a link to where it has already been answered it's because the guy responding you knows of such topic already and is bored to write the explanation himself, just linking works as sharing the knowledge anyway, you don't get those links from any guy who stumbled by, but from someone who knows such topics.<br><br>Make sure to ask if you have a question, don't think we'll get angry saying "we've answered that a million times", or "scram noob, don't ask stupid questions" ,nobody here would do that.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Simple as this: if you're going to reply a less experienced player you either help him or don't reply, making fun of them or getting angry at the same questions over and over is childih attitude, I won't waste my time posting to complain from reading the same questions, it's pretty useless, nobody in their sane minds should do so. Those who do might be "better players" since they know what you're asking, but if they just reply to bother then they aren't really good community members IMO, just trash people that needs to be owned when met in PvP.<br><br>Well... we're nice people here at the guild, maybe not so much in the entire forums, too many people there to judge... I'm pretty sure most guild members here who don't want to help will simply won't reply, that's the easiest thing to do.<br><br>Of course, there might be other forums where there's a good searcher, or heck, if you make a question that makes clear you didn't try to search then you will be flamed on good reasons. It's like asking a question that's responded on a sticky thread with an obvious topic name, don't do such things.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Google does allow you to make site-specific searches, so that might be better than using the native forum search function.<br><br>Add "site:nwn.bioware.com" after your search words there. Unfortunately it will only find things in the open forums, not guild forums. I guess the google-bot has never registered its nwn cd-key. Probably too busy playing.
