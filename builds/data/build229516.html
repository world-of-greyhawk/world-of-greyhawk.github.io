The only thing close to this build was: <br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225316", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Death Cometh with 92 Hide /Rogue 19/Ranger 15/Monk 6,</a> which as you can see traded 4 levels of ranger, with 4 levels of Rogue.  Which would give you a slight better Sneak attack, but I think you lose 1 or 2 ab points.  I'm not sure.<br>The real race for this build is Elf.  You lose that extra Feat at the beginning, but the ability point bonus.  *Shrugs* If you start with 17 Dex, and put the points into Constitution, it might be favorable to go Human.<br>Anyway, without further wait, Ranger of the Fist (Ranger 19/Monk 6/ Rogue 15)<br><br><i>playable 1 - 40 PvM</i><br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment:  Lawful Good<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str: 12<br>Dex: 18<br>Con: 8<br>Wis: 14 <br>Int: 12 <br>Cha: 8 <br><br><br>Leveling<br><br>1 Ranger: Weapon Finesse, Weapon Proficiency: Exotic, Favored Enemy: (Your Choice.)<br>2 Ranger<br>3 Ranger: Weapon Focus: Kukri<br>4 Ranger: Dexterity (+1)<br>5 Monk<br>6 Monk: Toughness<br>7 Monk<br>8 Monk: Dexterity (+1)<br>9 Monk: Optional Feat (I took Great Fortitude, saves are slightly low.)<br>10 Monk<br>11 Rogue<br>12 Rogue: Dexterity (+1) Improved Critical: Kukri<br>13 Rogue<br>14 Ranger: Favored Enemy: (Your Choice.)<br>15 Ranger: Optional Feat (I took Iron Will, saves still slightly low.)<br>16 Ranger: Dexterity (+1)<br>17 Ranger<br>18 Ranger: Lightning Reflex.<br>19 Rogue<br>20 Rogue: Dexterity (+1)<br>21 Rogue: Weapon Focus: Kukri<br>22 Rogue<br>23 Ranger: Epic Prowess<br>24 Ranger: Dexterity (+1) Armor Skin<br>25 Ranger<br>26 Rogue<br>27 Rogue: Greater Dexterity<br>28 Ranger: Dexterity (+1)<br>29 Ranger<br>30 Ragner: Favored Enemy: (Your Choice.), Greater Dexterity<br>31 Ranger<br>32 Rogue: Dexterity (+1) Improved Evasion.

Uhm, I just thought of something.  It might not be important, and I don't know if you'd have to drop Epic Dodge, it's not something I'd do, but if you take a couple more Ranger levels, you'd be able to squeeze in Bane of Enemis, which is a 2d6 +2 damage to all of your favored Enemies.<br><br>And if you play arena, you'd have what 4 Favored enemies, and if you chose Halfling/Human/Dwarf/Elf, you'd have all the core PvP races.<br><br>With this character, you really don't do too much Damage.  You depend on your Sneaks for damage, and your KDing and Stuns to keep it going.  The extra 2d6 +2, would up your damage alot.  I mean with regular kukris you do 1d4+1, with a 8d6 Sneak, If you went for Bane of Enemies you'd probably have to drop at the most 2d6 sneak.  Which with luck you'll get with almost every attack on your enemy, but atleast this way you get an extra 2, and a 2d6 on Every attack no matter waht.<br><br>I'd only suggest it for, Arena though.  You wouldn't get enough favored enemies to make it worth it, if you were planning on fighting a range of enemies.<br>_________________<br>~Blake~

Quite okay, it has some potential. You should end the build Ranger21/Monk6/Rogue 13. You need 21 Ranger for BoE, which is quite necessary in a dex ranger, and you need 13 Rogue for epic dodge. That limits your epic feats. You need 5 FE's to qualify for Boe, so no epic feats from ranger slots. Another general epic feat must be used for Epic dodge. 5 feats left, getting yourself in a tight spot here. 3 of those can be used for EWF, EP and AS. 2 left for great DEX, ending DEX at 30.<br>Tough build to get right, but that should do it.<br><br>If you decide Boe is not worth it, trade in 1 lvl of Ranger for Rog 16, which gives you another feat, perhaps Crippling strike or Slippery Mind. At lvl 30, use the FE for EWF, opening 1 general feat, which you can use on Greater DEX, thus ending you DEX on 32. You have so few FE's, one less won't matter. Pre-epic, switch the Lightning reflexes for Blind Fight. You REF save is good enough.<br><br>As for playability, I know this guy will have a really rough ride until he closes on the epic's. Once he get to around lvl 16 or so, and from there on he will get better and better. But for the first 15 or so, life will be hard.<br><br>A few tweaks and this guy should be quite nice, at least once you have managed to survive to late pre-epics.<br><br>Grimnir out<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 02/06/06 16:43</span></i></p>

Well, I was attracted to Ranger first of all, for several reasons.<br><br>One, you have the slight magic, meaning you can cast Cat's Grace.  You have, an Animal Companion, just in case you get in that tight squeeze, or need someone to take the heat off you.<br><br>Then, Number One reason is the Free Ranger Feats.  Two Weapon Fighting Feats.<br><br>It wasn't until After I posted I realized the BoE, which I would have for sure done.  Because I packed those last levels of Rogue in there for the Extra Sneak.  I don't really need those, if I go BoE.<br><br>I agree it's not going to be totally playable through most of his life, but it's a good arena build or an Action Server.<br><br>I play mostly on RP, but I love to see what I can throw together.  This is my first build posted here, even though I've been a member for quite some time. Just now got brave enough with my builds.<br><br>I have a Fighter/Bard/RDD, build though I'm sure it's out there somewhere already.  I'll search it and if I can't find it, I'll have it posted before the nights over.<br>_________________<br>~Blake~
