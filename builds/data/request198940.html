I would think Bard 16/Rogue 13/AA 11 would probably be the best combo.  You can get level 5 (6 boosted) bard spells, the level 16 bard song and curse song, epic dodge, +6 from the enchanted arrows and a 7D6 sneak attack.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

To elaborate, say Elf (you could go half-elf to avoid the XP penalty)  With base attributes<br>STR 10<br>DEX 16<br>CON 12<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 16<br><br>Go Bard 4/Rogue 6/AA 10 pre-epic, for pre-epic feats: point blank shot, rapid shot, called shot, weapon focus (longbow), curse song, lingering song, toughness.  For epic feats: great dexterity I-IV, epic weapon focus (longbow), epic prowess, improved evasion, defensive roll and epic dodge.  Spend all ten attribute bonuses on DEX.  <br><br>You should finish with a 47 AB, unbuffed with a normal longbow unbuffed.  With bard song and war cry you can raise that to 49 and with curse song you can lower your opponents AC by 5 (effectively raising your AB to 54, 60 on a successful taunt).  Your damage should be 6+1D8 peircing +7D6 sneak attack (+3 bludgeoning and +2 slashing with bard song and war cry) with a normal longbow.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 06/15/05 09:24</span></i></p>
