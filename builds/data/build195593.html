<b> Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>Kreon grunted as he forced the sacrificial dagger through the thick pectoral muscle of the ensorcelled unicorn.  As the blade pierced its heart, he could feel the final spasms of its life magnified as vibrations through the length of the blade.  With a jerk he pulled the dagger free, watching as a torrent of blood issued forth from the gaping wound into a silver ewer he had carefully positioned.  He wiped the blade of the bejewelled dagger on the mane of the magically held beast and checked his finely embroidered black robes for blood.  Satisfied that he had evaded most of the splatter, he stepped back to regard his handiwork.<br><br>The unicorn stood motionless, like some strange macabre fountain as its blood filled the ewer, it was not the unsteady spurting flow one would expect, but a continuous stream that would drain all the blood from its body.  Already it’s once ivory skin was beginning to appear ashen as it tightened over the muscular frame.  Soon the magical wound of the dagger would desiccate the body of the beast, and the Necromancer could continue his work.  A few feet infront of this spectacle, a raven haired young woman in a flowing white gown knelt with her back to a tree.  Kreon grabbed her jaw and jerked her head upwards, carefully gazing into her vacant eyes.  Confident that she was still under his power, he let her head slip back down.  She was a comely lass, and perhaps he would have some fun before he ended her life as well.  Smiling at the thought, he turned back to the now emaciated corpse of the unicorn and called for his skeletal attendants to bring him his tools.  <br><br>The flow of blood had ceased, as Kreon began to rub a deeply spiced black oil into it’s now smooth leathery hide.  With some of the pliability restored to the skin, the necromancer began wrapping its body with rune covered bandages.  As the last rays of light began to fade and the shadows of the trees lengthened and merged into a carpet of darkness, Kreon began to cast his final spell.  As his chant began to rise, the shadows began to pulse to the rise and fall of his voice.  As the spell reached its climax, the darkness swelled and coursed into the body of the unicorn, bringing the mummified unicorn to life.  <br><br>For a moment there was silence except for the Necromancer’s panting as he sought to recover his strength, then another voice broke the silence.  Before Kreon could react, the darkness was pierced by a blinding light.  Shielding his blinded eyes and deafened by his own screams, Kreon didn’t see his undead minions burst into flame, or hear the unearthly scream of his new born stead as it was rushed to a second death.  Mumbling a spell to restore his senses, he struggled to his feet.  As blur before his eyes cleared to reveal the flaming remains of his servants, the enraged necromancer turned to face the interloper that had ruined months of planning.  That was what he planned on doing anyway, Kreon’s feet couldn’t move.  As the necromancer looked down he could see the earth itself drawing itself over his limbs and hardening into stone.  Moving swiftly, Kreon tore a talisman from his neck and flung it to the ground before him.  As it struck the ground, it exploded in a cloud of brimstone, which cleared to reveal the massive muscular form of a Balor, a flaming whip clutched in its clawed left hand.   Kreon smiled at the thought of the massive beast demolishing his assailant.<br><br>Kreon’s smile soon turned to an expression of horror as several arrows, fired from behind him, smashed into the back of the demon striking between its batlike wings as it stumbled forward.  Smashed was the only word to describe the effect of the arrows, for the arrows exploded in a burst of holy light, which dissolved the Balor’s flesh as they struck their target.  The demon screamed, the flames that wreathed its skull like head intensified and to match its ire as it turned to face its attacker and the unrelenting stream of arrows.  As the demon stepped forward, an arrow smashed into its knee, forcing it to the ground.  A few more arrows to the neck, and the demon exploded in a rush of flame.  <br><br>Protected from the fire by his robe, Kreon didn’t feel fortunate.  He was still encased in stone with an unseen opponent behind him.  Kreon cringed at the thought of those deadly arrows piercing his body.  “No arrows will send you to your grave, defiler.  You wounded nature and now nature will wound you.” whispered a deep raspy male voice that sent a chill down his spine.  Kreon, heard another chant from behind him.  Kreon heard a strange sound, like a combination of scratching and chittering.  “I’ll be leaving now,” spoke the voice, “but before I go.” A final arrow, this one enchanted with a light spell, struck the ground before him.  Kreon understood the sound now; the ground was carpeted with a sea of ants, spiders and scorpions that rushed towards him.  Kreon was frozen with fear as the insect army scaled the stone that held him in place.  As the first insect bit into his flesh he screamed.          <br><br>This is a build designed for low or no magic worlds.  It is a caster cleric/druid that focuses primarily on spells, resorting to the bow or scimitar as a last resort. Between the cleric and druid levels the build has access to several offensive spells as well as melee buffs and curative magics, making it an excellent support character in a party setting.  There are a few other druid/clerics but most of them focus on dragon shape and ignore the other strengths of this character combination.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-Level 9 Cleric and Druid spells.  He has a ton of spells that he can cast.  While Druid and Cleric spells may not be as offensive as wizard or sorcerer spells, they typically have hard to resist damage types.  Or like harm, require no saving throws whatsoever. <br>-Good Spell DCs.  Unbuffed he has a DC of 20+spell level (26+spell level for conjuration). He can easily increase his wisdom by 12 with spells to gain a DC of 26 (32 for conjuration) + spell level.  The conjuration focus was chosen for spells like stone hold and creeping doom.  It could be changed for evocation if that focus would be more useful. <br>-Good AB with a bow. He might not be a match for an arcane archer, but he can add divine and magical damage to his attacks, which can get past most DR<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br><br>-Low Caster Level- Against opponents with a high SR he can't rely on his spells for offense.  However he's pretty good at combat so it's not that big of a problem.<br>-Low Reflex Save-  He'll get hammered by mage evocation spells.  His healing spells will help a bit, as will spells like word of faith that can temporarily shut down an enemy caster.<br>-Mediocre Fortitude Save- It's pretty good against spells, but it's not good enough to deal with devastating critical<br>-Low Melee AB and no melee feats like knockdown-  In a no or low magic world, his buffs should be sufficient to increase to a competent level if the need arises.<br><br><b>Sylvan Justice</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Human<br><br><i>Alignment</i> True Neutral<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 14  <br>DEX 8 <br>CON 14  <br>WIS 16  <br>INT 10  <br>CHA

I like the text:)<br><br>For the build :<br><br>I think you will have difficulty with spellresisting  monsters and then your only resort is melee (at which every level 15+ cleric is quite reasonable) and creeping doom.<br><br>You might wanna consider fitting in dragon shape. But roleplay-wise this might be a no-go <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

not a bad concept, but very watered down, you have niether a spell caster, nor a divine warrios.<br><br>for a divine warrior i would do more CoT and much more charisma. your divine might is all but useless, it will last at most 8 rounds, and thats IF you have the items to boost charisma by +12, 2 with out the items. if you have items that HAVE to boost a stat in order for it to be useful, then your loosing on some other item properties.<br><br>I would take at least 8 CoT lvls pre epic, and ditch the druid for bard or paladin, and put more stuff into charisma.<br><br>also, why conjugation? maybe its just me, but a lot of people seem to want a conjurgation specialist cleric, and i just don't see it.

Both the druid and cleric spells are adequate at the selected level and have good DCs for most purposes.  The character has an unbuffed AB with a longbow of 40, which with cleric buffs is more than adequate for an archer in a low or mid magic world.  Hence it fills that roll.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>for a divine warrior i would do more CoT and much more charisma. your divine might is all but useless, it will last at most 8 rounds, and thats IF you have the items to boost charisma by +12, 2 with out the items. if you have items that HAVE to boost a stat in order for it to be useful, then your loosing on some other item properties.<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>The character can cast Eagle's Splendor (look it up, it's a level 2 cleric spell), maximized it's good for a +5 to charisma, meaning he only needs +7 to get the max, (that's a potion of Eagle's Splendor and a Nymph's Cloak.)<br>Even in a no magic world, it will last for 4 rounds and add 4 points of divine damage to each attack.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>I would take at least 8 CoT lvls pre epic, and ditch the druid for bard or paladin, and put more stuff into charisma.<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I've already done a divine warrior (cleric/paladin/CoT), the point of this character is support, which this character does far better than the character you suggested above. <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>also, why conjugation? <br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I always felt grammar was important for a cleric <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>maybe its just me, but a lot of people seem to want a conjurgation specialist cleric, and i just don't see it.

He can also cast vine-mine (entangle) with a 37 DC, stone hold with a 38 DC, creeping doom with a 39 DC and bombardment with a 40 DC.  All of these spells only affect hostile opponents, and the former two will hold opponents in place, which is very useful in a party setting.  Most evocation spells will still have some effect if the save is made, so I felt that they didn't need the DC boost as much as the conjurations did.

This spell, will lower an opponents SR by 3D4 (no save, no SR), so 7.5 on average.  The highest item SR is 32, which would be lowered to 24.5 giving him a 37.5% failure rate after the spell is cast, which isn't bad.  Enemies tend to be divided into 3 categories, enemies with no SR, enemies with item or skin SR or monks.  He'll do fine against the first two groups, and only a pure caster with the spell penetration feats will stand a chance against a pure monk.

For the 32 wisdom, you spent 16 attribute points for an 18 base wisdom, so unshifted you are far weaker than this build.  You have much lower saves than this build as well.  Because of the dragon shape your build may have the edge in a one on one setting, although my build may be able to take out your dragon with spells, and if there is a doorway he should win.  However, my build is a far superior support archer than yours.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 05/19/05 07:41</span></i></p>

you are right of course, i apologies for comparing these builds in PvP,it  was not my original intention, i see what the build is for, but i just believe that 17 lvls of druid are a waist for you... would not more cleric lvls and better cleric domain powers and more cleric spells be better? for me, its one thing, i need more spells, but for you, i dont see any reason other than really premonition. or put more points into charisma to get more out of it<br><br>oh, and my implosion DC is 45 with a wis of 44, thats 32 + 12 which both of us can get, +8 from owls insight and the 4 from owls wisdom (or empowered)<br>thats better than most Dev crits <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   <br><br>another benefit of wis 44 (if you can get it from items) is an extra lvl 9 spells <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; Actually, your greater dispelling would only work against him about 40% of the time, so it would on average only remove less than half of his buffs.

Dragon shape can be taken with only 14 druid levels, provided that the wisdom requirement is met.
