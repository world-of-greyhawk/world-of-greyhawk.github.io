OK, so I am trying to help with the posting of existing builds. I decided to work backwards from the most recent, so I copied the builds from pages 1-9 of v.5 and pages 11-23 of v.4...then I started misspelling things like 'elven' so I knew it was time to take a break <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>One must still have chaos in one to give birth to a dancing star! <br>~Friedrich Nietzsche

no problem at all, I'm no good at building C's so I figured I ought to contribute somehow <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>OK so I have evrything copied from page 15 of v.3 to page 9 of v.5, also page 1 of v.3...don't ask <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_redface.gif"> <br><br>there are a couple of minor mistakes that I can't fix: I failed to use the "o0o" on either site of phrostbyte for one  of his builds, also added an 's' on the end of Crispycritter once.  One or perhaps two (hopefully not more) builds posted might be repetitions or near-repetitions, but I tried to look out for that and going backwards through the thread(s) helps avoid it I think.  <br><br>I tried to be consistent in what I considered 'eligible' as a complete build and I basically went with whether the post had a levelling guide...I think a few had only rough levelling guidelines but were well thought out otherwise and so were included. <br><br>It may be that some of these are illegal or exploit machines, I wasn't checking for that. I was just doing some grunt work so it can be fine-tuned by our resident experts <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I tried to copy over comments relevant to a particular build from the 'looking for excellent builds' thread when they were easy to locate, ie., right underneath the build post <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  I would hope that either the authors or those with a particular interest in the build would be kind enough to post important and relevant comments to the individual builds in the Epic Character Builds Forum here for convenience.<br>_________________<br>One must still have chaos in one to give birth to a dancing star! <br>~Friedrich Nietzsche
