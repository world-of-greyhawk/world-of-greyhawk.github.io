I am looking for a build that can undectedly kill off many creatures.  For this build I wish to employ the shadow attack ability.  Optimally I wish to use this PvM  where few monsters have blind fight. For those of you unfamiliar with shadow attack, I will explain:<br><br>1. Shadow attack deals 1d6 strength damage subject to a melee touch attack.  If the target does not have a higher strength than the damage amount he will suffer magical damage equal to his hit points instead.<br>2. Shadow attack incurs attacks of opportunity as a spell<br>3. Shadow attack is non-hostile in that it does not disturb a target or break invisibility of the caster.<br>4. Shadow attack is used once per round and is generated by a special AI.<br>5. The only summons with the special AI for shadow attack are from the shadowdancer progression.  Of these the shadow fiend is the only one that can reliably use the shadow attack ability time after time.  This shadow fiend requires 6-8 levels of shadowdancer, no more no less.<br><br><br>A refresher on melee touch attacks:<br><br>1. Melee touch attacks have a roll of d20 + strength modifier + BAB + effects.  (Epic prowess also helps, but the shadow fiend does not have it).<br>2. Melee touch attacks negate the armor, shield, and natural armor bonuses.<br>3. Dodge, tumble, and dexterity (if unsecured) bonuses can also be negated if the target is caught flatfooted.<br>4.  A hidden creature (the target can't see it) will catch the target flatfooted unless the target has blind fight.<br><br><br>As the shadowdancer only gets one summon per day, the build must revolve around the survival of this summon.  <br>There are many spells to help, among them are:<br><br>Negative energy burst<br>Stone bones<br>Bless<br>Aid<br>Invisibility<br>Darkness<br>Immobilization spells (hold, evard's, stonehold, etc.)<br>Fire, cold, and electric area of effect spells (shadow fiends are immune to these.)<br><br>Feel free to suggest builds.  Remember the shadow fiend can't kill everything, though if used correctly it is an extremely powerful weapon for a summon.

What a request!!  <br><br>Can you guess what im thinking????<br><br><br><br><br><br>Take shadowdaner 8/rogue 6/cleric or druid 26.  For me the caster is essential to BUFF the minion.  Im not sure which is more beneficial for this one.  If you take cleric, id look for stoneskin as a domain spell for sure.  Improve invis aswell would be very strong.  <br><br>The one concern i would have with this is, a lv 8 minion isnt terribly reliable in upper lvls where you will get hit hard.  You would probably need maximun or empowered endurance to assist. <br><br>just my 2 cents<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; -- Posted by Kail Pendragon  <br><br>Being hyperbolic is an integral part of Avado's being <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

A buffer sounds like a pretty good choice, you want your minion to have more AC, to heal him, raise AB, damage, whatever. Personally I'd make a Druid 29 / Monk 1 / Shadowdancer 10, perhaps DEX based with Epic Dodge, or the usual WIS based should work too, SD 10 gives Improved Evasion anyway, so I'd say 10 SD levels should be better than 8. However, that's just because I like Druids. As a Druid you can buff a bit of AC and some STR... the Animal Companion might help you divert damage and you've got some power as a caster and meleer. Stonehold comes to mind, I like that spell.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 09/06/09 04:30</span></i></p>
