Ok, there are really only two problems I see with this build:<br><br>1) Your AB is horrendous, and<br><br>2) You only have 4 caster levels.  <br><br><br>Really, you shouldn't even be able to hit most mages with this build, unless they intentionally keep their AC low because they <i>want</i> melee characters to be able to hit them.  <br><br>If you want a better AB, you might consider taking something other than Monk.  The only thing Monk is really doing for you is giving you Evasion and helping to boost your saves, which I admit is nice, but probably not worth it.  <br><br>Paladin would seem like a better choice as you would potentially be able to use a Holy Avenger, which dispels on-hit with no save, although of course you would either need a decent Paladin level (15+) or a mod in which you could actually find the weapon.  <br><br>The other thing, of course, is not to pump so many points into Con.  Rather than putting all your points into Con, get a decent starting Con, maybe 14, and take Toughness.  Then, put the rest of your stat points into either Str or Dex and this should help your AB.  If you choose to go Dex-based, make sure to take the Weapon Finesse feat. <br><br>You might consider a Sorc/RDD build or Bard/RDD rather than a Wiz/PM build.  The PM build would of course allow you to take Epic Spells, but since you're not taking any of those anyway it might not be worth it.  RDD would give you IMMUNITY to Fire, so then if you took a few Energy Resistance: Acid feats you should do OK.  <br><br>So, to sum it all up, maybe try something like a Sorc/Paladin/RDD.  You can go heavy on either Sorc or Paladin, depending on whether you prefer to focus on spellcasting or melee.  If you take enough Sorc levels you might actually be able to use Mord's to dispel a caster's buffs, but of course high level casters would probably resist this.

To add to what he said: your SR is meaningless with only 20 monk levels. 30 SR is nothing to a mage. You're just as vulnerable to a mage, except that you'll take a little less reciprocal damage than some. But, unless your server has really screwed up items, you'll most likely be taking a lot more damage than you dish out, and that's not even taking into consideration the IGMS being spammed into you.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

First of all as I said I drifted from the original idea and just played around with the build.<br><br>@CrispyCritter<br><br>1) Indeed the AB is terrible - in testing I didn't find it as big a problem as it looks like.<br><br>2) Well 4 WIZ + 16 PM should give me 12 casting levels as far as I know, he can cast spells as a 12 level Wizard anyway I didn't note the DC but the spells (mainly True Seeing) were meant for buffs when I tested against a high level Rogue. Dispel magic and Spell breach works even against a high level wiz/sorc and they will remove some spells.<br><br>I'm very well aware of the possibilities in chosing sorcerer instead of wizard but besides for the spellcasting CHA isn't really that usefull. INT is always usefull.<br><br>Also going for high CON and DR was intentional, changing that would kinda ruin my concept of a human+undead+outsider kind of character <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>Thanks for the comments.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By MartinJHolm on 03/11/05 18:02</span></i></p>

If you're not playing on a world with the PrC, or one that fixes the PM caster level bug, your PM levels don't count for caster levels.  Thus, you only get 4 caster levels, as that is your Wizard level.  <br><br>As for Dispel, this probably isn't going to do much against a higher level mage.  You will get (1d20 + 4) to beat a check of (Caster level + 11) in order to dispel, meaning that if you're trying to dispel something off even a 15th level caster, there's pretty much no chance of it happening.  <br><br>As for breaches, they should be able to remove <i>some</i> spells, but I think they mostly remove defensive spells like mantles and things of that nature.

What Martin (I think) is trying to say is that the above build gets the same spell slots as a level 12 wizard (which it does). However you are also quite correct (iirc) in pointing out that the effective casting level of this wizard is 4 (ie all spells cast are the same efficiency ,duration etc as a level 4 wiz).<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

I stand corrected.  Martin, you must not have ever been smacked down with a smite evil/good before.  Charisma based characters can deal out a heck of a lot of damage, its just that they are limited in the number of times they can do it per rest.  A well built Charisma char can be better then a well built strength meleer.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

The CHA is useful for Paladins and any other classes that uses it... The higher you have it as, the stronger your ablities, spells and so on is.
