It's a fairly strong fighter. Two things, though:<br><br>Your saves are painfully low. You will never save against any effect, ever, unless it has a similarly low DC. This raises the fact that spellcasters will roast you. Of course, spellcasters will roast most fighters, so I guess this is old news.<br><br>You really don't benefit much from dual weild. Those two extra attacks per round aren't worth it - by dropping dex to 13 you can pump strength up to 17 for an extra epic feat, which gives you 4 AB, 3-8 AC (shield based), 3 feats, and one epic feat. At the very least you could use this to grab an extra WM weapon for multiple damage types.<br>_________________<br>CATS!
