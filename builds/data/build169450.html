OVERVIEW<br><br>The Versatile Songmaster offers the best possible Bardsong as well as every possible skill in the game as a class skill.  The four pre-epic Ranger levels give four attack per round.  Also, the build is very flexible and can be tailored to your preferences.  This is not a powerful melee build, but it offers a great variety of tactics for solo play and makes a tremendous support character in a party.<br><br>CREDITS<br><br>My research for this build consisted mostly of playing a horribly, hopelessly, painfully twisted version of it in the OC.  Even so, it was a fun character to play and I felt that it could be redeemed.  After checking this forum and not noticing any other builds that took bard to level 30, I decided to work this up.<br><br>VARIATIONS<br><br>- It doesn’t really matter when you take the Rogue and Ranger levels, as long as you follow the “rule of four”.  Just take four Rogue levels and four Ranger levels pre-epic and the last one of each after level 20.  I mixed levels at the beginning because low-level Bards are so weak, the added a break to allow banking skill points for Rogue and Ranger class skills.  Finally, I added a huge break before taking the last Rogue and Ranger levels at levels 38 and 39, to allow more skill banking.  If you want a different mix, go for it.  <br><br>- I went with Ranger as a Figher-ish class to achieve my goal of making every skill in the game available as a class skill.  Ranger gives Animal Empathy, and uses the best attack bonus table to get the fourth attack per round.  I find Animal Empathy fun and useful, and it fits my concept of this character.  But if you don’t care about it, substitute Fighter for a stronger build – you can work in Improved Two-Weapon Fighting this way.<br><br>- The only feats central to the build are Skill Focus, Epic Skill Focus, Curse Song, and Lasting Inspiration.  Change up the rest however you like.<br><br>- You can increase Charisma instead of Dexterity after level 20 to get more Bard spells and free up the Skill Focus slot for another epic feat instead.  Great Charisma and Great Dexterity are both available as Bard bonus feats if you wish to use them.<br><br>BARDSONG AND HOW TO GET PERFORM 100<br><br>The main strength of this build is the Bardsong.  A fully maxed Bardsong is incredible.  The attack and save bonuses are nice, but the 48 bonus hit points, +7 to AC, and 19 extra skill points to everyone in your party put it over the top.  Then via Curse Song you can subtract the same things from your opponents via Curse Song, and you’ve tilted the fight your direction in a huge way.  Like Taunt?  You’ve just added a 38 point gap in your favor to the chances it will succeed.  Anyone in your group like Knockdown or Disarm (or did you work those into the Bard build)?  Same effect on the chances.  Have an especially difficult trap to disarm or persuade check to pass?  And opponents get no save!  (Sonic damage resistance does apply, but that’s rare.)  No problem.  Thing is, all this requires a Perform skill of 100, which you just can’t get without equipment.  Fortunately, it is doable with items available in the game.  Here’s the math:<br>   Max Perform Skill            = 43<br>   Skill Focus (Perform)        =  3<br>   Epic Skill Focus (Perform)   = 10<br>   Epic Gloves of the Minstrel  = 30<br>   Belt of the Performer+5      =  4<br>   Adjusted Charisma of 30      = 10<br>  -----------------------------------<br>                                 100<br>The Belt of the Performer gives CHA+5, and a Nymph Cloak +7 finishes off the CHA adjustment.  If you’re into creating items in the toolset, you can get the same bonuses with fewer inventory slots by making uber-items.  Keep in mind that you can have both the normal and the curse version of Bardsong active at the same time.  Although singing multiple times doesn’t stack, you can “re-sing” curse to add its effects to any new baddies that have shown up, or that you encounter in the next fight before the first curse song has worn off.  Your Bardsong is your most potent weapon in this build.

Just for fun, here is some backstory on how I play this character:<br><br>=============================<br><br>I am the son of a dedicated human Ranger and a whimsical elf maiden.  My father taught me much of the Ranger's ways, and had he survived I might have taken that path.  But it was not to be.  My parent's marriage could never have been more than a moment in my mother's long life.  But even that moment was cut short when my father was ambushed and murdered by bandits.  I was but a boy at the time.<br><br>After my father's death, my mother and I moved to the ancestral home of her people.  She rejoined elven society, but I was never accepted.  In self defense, I became a social chameleon, able to create a rapport with anyone.  Elves love music, and I found I had great talent.  So I hid my loneliness with a smile and a song.  Never quite at peace, I dabbled in whatever anyone would teach me.  I learned a bit of sorcery, a bit of thievery, a bit of combat.<br><br>In time, I realized that I would never have a real home in my mother's world.  So as a young man, I departed.  I became both guide and guard, escorting merchant caravans through the forest.  I entertained the caravans with my music even as I defended them with my bow and swords.  When we encountered bandits, the memory of my father was strong and I exacted blood compensation for his death.    <br><br>This unpredictable life agreed with the impulsive tendencies that I inherited from my mother.  Still, I longed for the disciplined skill and resolute purpose of my father.  When I learned of the opportunity to train at Neverwinter Academy, I knew this was my way.<br><br>I will learn a bit of the Ranger's trade and a bit of the Rogue's.  But I am ever drawn to the path of the Bard.  I enjoy good company and I will continue to make friends wherever I go.  I will honor my father by helping those in need.  I have learned that a good song can help almost any situation, so I will continue to sing.<br><br>Oh, and I'll keep putting bandit heads on a pike at every opportunity.<br><br>Ember Swift<br>Initial Interview<br>Neverwinter Academy<br><br>=============================<br><br>After spending much time with Ember Swift, I am confident that he will become one of the Academy's most stellar successes.  He is still a very young man by half-elven standards, and sometimes acts with the foolishness of youth.  Even so, he has already lived more than half a normal human life, and has distinguished himself in many ways.  <br><br>Ember's skills in battle are rough and untrained, but effective.  His preference for dual-wielding shortswords is reckless for one so slight of frame.  But his quickness and cunning allow him to succeed, or retreat and change strategies when necessary.  He excels with the longbow.  With training and experience he could become a master.<br><br>Psychologically, Ember is a complex individual.  He consciously believes that through noble achievement he can carry on the work of his deceased father.  He unconsciously believes that through a charming personality and a captivating song, he can compensate for his boyhood failure to adapt to life among the Elves.  I expect that Ember will accept and complete many quests as an adventurer.  In doing so, he will seek approval from a father who cannot give it after death, and a mother who does not think to give it during life.  In time, I hope Ember will realize he does not truly wish to be accepted for his deeds, but simply for himself.  <br><br>Instructor's Evaluation<br>Neverwinter Academy<br><br>=============================<br><br>  "Can you read my mind?"  The pretty elven girl looked intensely at Ember.  She had been unusually serious tonight, and Ember feared the reason.<br>  "Of course not", he replied.  <br>  "Then how?" she asked.  "How do you seem to see into my soul, to know my thoughts even before I do?"  <br>  "Your eyes, your face, your movements, all these speak to me clearly.  The sky doesn't speak, yet you can tell its temperment at a glace.  People are little different, if one knows how to look."  He watched as her face became shadowed.  He had been close to this girl - very close - and his heart sank as he saw the tears begin to form in her eyes.<br>  "And what do my eyes say now?" she asked, her throat tight and her voice trembling.  Ember returned her intense gaze.  Indeed she was beautiful, with hair the color of honey and eyes of the deepest green.  Though four times his age, a human would have thought her two years his junior.  In fact, she was almost eighty years old, but still barely a young woman by elven standards.  Her life might span ten centuries.  Though half-elven himself, Ember could not expect to live a third as long.  He paused, hesitant to say what he must.  When he finally answered, his own voice was hoarse.<br>  "Your eyes say that you could not watch as your husband grew old and died while you were still in the prime of your life.  They say that you could not watch as your children, cursed with the fast burning life of human blood, were buried before you."  He paused, momentarily unable to continue.  His own eyes were growing misty and he blinked back tears of his own.  <br>  "They say that, though you might love me, you could never marry me."  He did not want to continue, but he knew he had no choice.  For too long he had hoped without cause, denying what he knew to be true.  He had tried his utmost to find a way around this moment, but there was none.  His voice quivered as he finished:  "They say goodbye."  <br>  She tried to speak but her quivering chin would not allow it.  Instead she nodded quickly as the tears began to flow down her face.  Ember kissed her gently on the forehead, then turned and left the room.  That very night he packed his few belongings and left the home of his mother's people.  If he could not find a home among the elves, then he would seek one in the world of men.<br><br>=============================

Boosting CHA instead of DEX after level 20 gives more bard spells, and you can switch out the Skill Focus Perform for a different feat and still get Perform=100.

You'd get an experience penalty, but if you time the levels right it would only apply to the experience gained between the last level of Ranger (at 39) and the last level of Bard (at 40).  That'd still be a potent Bard song, with nice improvements from both the Rogue and Ranger levels.  You still wouldn't get any Ranger spells, unless you shifted the abilities around to increase Wisdom at the expense of something else.  <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;One of the reasons for making this build/taking these classes was to be able to take every skill.

The level 40 one I've only tried in a character-builder type module in arena combat against canned opponents.  For that build I tossed most everything into either Perform or the fighting-related feats.<br><br>I have another version of the build that I'm planning to play all the way to 40 via various modules.  It is currently at level 21.  I've put at least one point into everything except Craft Armor, Craft Trap, Craft Weapon, and Parry.<br><br>I've gone heavy on:<br>Perform (obvious reasons)<br>Taunt (great against certain opponents)<br>Tumble (for AC and avoiding AoOs) <br>UMD (so I can weak Monk gear).  <br><br>I've also put a good deal into Persuade and Animal Empathy (because they fit my character concept).  Plus I enjoy it when I'm attacked by a pack of animals and can start them fighting against each other instead.  (Yeah, I know that's out of character for a Ranger.  I still like it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> ) <br><br>I dropped a good deal into Disable Trap and Open Locks in my first round of Rogue levels, because I won't get another chance to to increase them until level 38 (if I follow the leveling per my original post).<br><br>One nifty thing about the bard song is that about the time skill checks tend to start getting hard, the bard song skill bonus kicks in.  So to some extent, the skills eventually start taking care of themselves.  I try to put a little into anything that requires training, so that I can benefit from the skill bonus.<br><br>Thanks for your comments!<br>_________________<br>Disarm?

Bard song is a great equalizer.  In fact with it active and extened war cry your AB is the same or better then a WM.  Without taking all those required feats.
