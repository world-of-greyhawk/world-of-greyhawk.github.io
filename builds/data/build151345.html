This build loses 1 attack/round for a dual wielder over a pure fighter (3 base attacks+ 2 from improved 2WF). Still much better from the 2 or 3 attacks/round of most mage builds. The only way to get the full 4 base preepic attacks for this build would be to go F9/S1/RDD10 preepic which would limit SRC to 20 (with 1 more fighter level post-epic for EWS). The SRC 23 is valuable for the epic spell which IMO is more important than the extra attack, but opinions may vary.<br>3.

Again, I would strongly recommend you lose the 2-Weapon feats.  It's possible to get +16 BAB and auto-still spell 3 with a build like this, you just need to take 10 lvls of a high-BAB class pre-epic.  Fighter works, as does Paladin, Blackguard, and even Dwarven Defender.  My favorite variation on this build is Sorc 20/RDD 10/Blackguard 10.  The Blackguard really helps you take advantage of the high Charisma as it boosts your saving throws, and you can use Divine Shield to make it boost your AC as well.  If you don't mind sacrficing another lvl of Sorc (and thus one 9th lvl spell), you can use BG to max out Taunt, which can be fun to use in PvP, although it's probably mostly worthless in PvM.    <br><br>Darshue posted a build like this a long time ago; I think he was dual-wielding Scimitars rather than Rapiers, but it was pretty similar if I recall.  He called it the True Dragon Knight; you should be able to find it in the index.  If you want I can post I good build with any of the above classes, but like I said the BG version is probably my favorite.

Crispy- I would like to see your BG variant of this.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

I've seen this build. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  I'll add my comments, and summarize the things that were said in the NWN forum about this one, and you can comment on them individually:<br><br>- It would be nice to see actual AB and AC posted, and skill points. And type of armor, since ASF is a factor in this build.  Its awfully inconvenient to have to go back and review the build closely to see that "max Discipline" isnt really all that "maxed" in total build sense, since your last Fighter/RDD level is at level 22.<br><br>- Str-based dual wielder means lower AC; your only prevention of this occurs way late at level 39 via Epic Spells.  Put lower Discipline on the list too, and you are a good candidate for knockdown/disarm.  If that last Sorc level at 40 isnt doing too much for you (it isnt, is it?), putting another Fighter or RDD level there instead could fix this.   <br><br>- A dual-wielder build can maybe use Expertise and ImpExpertise; a possible use for 2 odd feat slots I'll mention shortly. . . <br><br>- You have Still Spell (not Auto-Still) and wear armor.  You then take Empower And Maximize (combat metamagic feats), which you cant use without ASF failure (presumably 45%, with Plate Mail)?  I think these slots would be more useful to the build as something else. <br><br>I realize you are calling this a "buffing" Sorc, and rightly so, but I beleive (not sure) this is why someone in the original topic said your Sorc was at 30% effectiveness; a large part of what makes a Sorc a powerhouse is its flexibility to cast many, many versions of a needed spell, thanks to metamagic slots.  You really cant do this in this build via Empower and Maximize without severe penalties.  And you cant cast 9th level spells at all without ASF, or stripping armor. Kind of a bummer.<br>_________________<br>Normal kids play rock-paper-scissors.<br>Shifter kids play IronGolem-RustMonster-MindFlayer. . .

How bout add Paladin lvls instead of Fighter? You get less AB,since you cant take the WS and EWS but you get saves, Divine Shield and Wrath(remove WS). <br><br>If you play on a server which doesnt support Devastating Critical, you get alot of other things you can add instead. Exange DC, EWS and Armor Skin against Automatic Still Spell 1,2,3, and by doing that you can also remove 2WF, Ambidexterity, and I2WF. This gives you more AC, due to the tower shield. Also switch Toughness and Ambidexterity for more HP(im not sure if it works that way though). <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif"> <br><br>Play Well <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
