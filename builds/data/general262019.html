Ok I posted this on many forums and never get a good suggestions so I thought that maybe it would be different here <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"> <br><br>I hope someone has good suggestions  <br><br>Here is what Im looking for in a PW<br><br>- lvl 1-40<br><br>- With PRC and CEP, I dont mind a few restriction on classes (like lich) and feats<br><br>- ROLEPLAY. I like role playing servers which do not force the RP aspect--I want to be able to decide when to RP. I like staying in character, I just might want to go it solo some of the time.<br><br>- Magic items I like beeing able to buy low magic items in shops (+1 to +3). Items +5 beeing considered really good and anything above that would be epic and legendary. No perma-haste items unless they are really rare.<br><br>- XP I dont like to get to lvl 40 in 2 days but since Im a casual player I expect something like 50xp for a moderate kill <br><br>- Loots and bosses: I like a pw wirh lots of loots (beeing random) and hard bosses to defeat.<br><br>- I want a pw with many areas and that is good looking <br><br>- No item lvl restrictions, no perma death <br><br>- and finally I want the PW to be challenging all the way to lvl 40<br><br>If any of you ever played on Natfka, that exactly the kind of PW Im looking for. Thanks<br>_________________<br>K.M.  aka Chillychill<br><br>"Y'a pire que ne pas pouvoir, y'a savoir qu'on peut et ne jamais tenter"

Well, since you haven't had any hits, I'll plug The World of Greyhawk (link in sig).  It lacks one of your prereqs, though, which is the PRC.  But who knows, perhaps a day will come when they pick it up.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Too bad you have such stringent rules!<br><br>I play on The MOUNTAIN  <a href="http://www.rpgmods.net/forgottenworlds/news.php" target="_blank">http://www.rpgmods.net/forgottenworlds/news.php</a><br><br>It uses modified PRC (for balance reasons of course!).  It has +10 gear available from stores etc.  IT is a party world.  And is balanced for that.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

I play on Athas Reborn, a PW based on the 2nd edition setting of Dark Sun. It meets all but one of your requirements, having item level restrictions. All the monsters are custom, likewise with all the items. It's part LOTR, part Mad Max. Come have a good time with some rotten people.<br><a href="http://www.athasreborn.com/forum/index.php?sid=440bc57c8063a4bd1004700782365211" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

Dark Sun setting? Sounds good. Is the metal very rare like it was in the original DnD setting?<br>_________________<br>K.M.  aka Chillychill<br><br>"Y'a pire que ne pas pouvoir, y'a savoir qu'on peut et ne jamais tenter"
