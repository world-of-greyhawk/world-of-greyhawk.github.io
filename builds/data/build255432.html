Slashing, Sneaking, Spreading Contagion, Torture and Fear PvM (1-40) and PvP<br><br>DARK PRINCE (“the Impaler”) <br><br>Concept: The Dark Prince (“the Impaler”)), is based on Prince Vlad (or Dracula – meaning, the “son of the dragon,” as he was known in his own time); a despotic ruler of Romania, whose political and military career is steeped deep in blood and torture. His was a dark and dual nature, both cruel yet highly charismatic: Impaler was a prominent Christian crusader whose sheer will and audacity saved Romania from invading Turks, and his legacy the model upon which the factual “Dracula” of Bram Stoker undead vampire is based. <br><br>This highborn member of a Romanian Court is “prominent in European history – and more terrifying than his fictional descendant. While not the black-cloaked, centuries-old, bloodsucker of literary fame, the infamy of the historical figure outperforms that of Stoker's creation.” Explains the Crime Library of his despotic rule and his exploits: <br><br>“He ruled his military kingdom of Wallachia – southern Romania – with a heavy and blood-soaked fist. To not only the Turks, but also to many of his own countrymen, he was The Impaler. During his tenure, he killed by the droves, impaling on a forest of spikes around his castle thousands of subjects who he saw as either traitors, would-be traitors or enemies to the security of Romania and the Roman Catholic Church. Sometimes, he slew merely to show other possible insurgents and criminals just what their fate would be if they became troublesome. A pamphlet published in Germany immediately following his death tells of his burning beggars after allowing them free food at his court.” <br><br>At the same time, the Crime Library continues: “the adventurous life led by (the Impaler) put him in contact with the era's most fascinating people…and he witnessed the rising use of gunpowder as a means of destruction, the Holy Crusades, the fall of Constantinople and the nouveau philosophy of art, alchemy and culture that became known as the Renaissance; …[t]hough many Westerners are baffled that a man whose political and military career was as steeped in blood as was that of Vlad Dracula," writes Elizabeth Miller for Journal of the Dark magazine, "the fact remains that for many Romanians he is an icon of heroism...It is this duality that is part of his appeal:" see, <a href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/history/vlad/index_1.html" target="_blank">Click Here</a>   <br><br>Character: While not the first of his type in terms of the class-combination chosen, this character differs from others in terms of the level-split and feats, in keeping with the real-life historical character upon who the Dark Prince (“the Impaler”) is based. <br><br>Strengths and Weaknesses: <br>Very Good AB and Damage, including the power of divine might, smite good, and 12d6 sneak damage; while AC is good, hitpoints are decent. Saves (particularly will) could definitely be better; however, all saves are in fact ‘savable’ thanks to BG Dark Blessing and UMD (or cha. items). In addition, can call in various reinforcements (including an Epic Fiendish Servant), and has a nice assortment of skills, including stealth and UMD, which enables self-buffing of all stats, and also combat/offense and defensive capabilities. <br><br>Without further adieu, please meet Dark Prince, the Impaler (Without Dev.

This looks good, Tyr.  Just a few things.  <br><br>--Make 1st level Rogue1 so you can start with 44 skill points vs. only 20 as a Fighter.  <br><br>--I don't think there's any need to wait until Level 19 for Blindfighting, when it's going to be needed long before then.  Typically, somewhere between 6th and 9th level is ideal for that Feat.<br><br><br>-- I think you can afford to take 4 Rogue pre-epic, and perhaps space them about a bit better in Epic as well.  I would take Rogue10 at Level 37 since there's no identifiable need to take it at 40.  I see you maxed your Stealth skills, but I would question that utility without some SFs or ESF's to compensate for heavy armor and low dex.  I would probably take Improved Evasion over CS since CS at that point is overkill.<br><br><br>Now, how does this one <i>differ</i> from the following:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "199875", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> The Abuser /Rogue 19/Fighter 11/Blackguard 10 + Revised Str+Dex Versions</a> by fernandooa<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "211824", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Charismatic Dwarf V1 /Rogue 4/Fighter 8/Blackguard 28</a> by Grimnir77<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "208450", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> His Infernal Mistress /Rogue 5/Fighter 10/Blackguard 25</a> by grizzled_dwarflord<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "146904", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Master Thrower /Fighter 14/Rogue 13/BG 13</a> by Kreestopearq<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "250775", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Beautiful Evil v2.0 /Rogue 10/Fighter 6/Blackguard 24</a> by whirlin_merlin<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 10/12/06 11:59</span></i></p>

Your idea about starting with rogue instead of fighter for 24 extra skill points is an interesting one; while life is generally better out-of-the-gate for a ftr, dunno, for some, those extra skills might be worth it (thus, a very viable alternative!). As to CS and overkill, ya nailed it: that'd be the whole essence of this character <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">   I personally like CS, especially on a character like this (also, no such thing as too much insurance when taking away a dev critter's DC among other str-feats, I say); but if that's not an issue or concern for someone, then, for sure: lots of great rogue bonus feats to select from (and good point).<br><br>I'm looking into your idea re: spacing rogue throughout epic; thinking about it now, indeed, that would no doubt enhance playability in terms of the skill dumps -- nice thinking, and thanks!  <br><br>As to differences, ... you want details do you, other than the obvious level splits? Alrighty then... <br><br>First, is the Abuser - which started life on the boards as a bg/rogue/ftr, but along the way changed its career path to become just a ftr/rogue (maybe someone should re-cap it or something? but when it was, in any event, dev crit w. only AB 40 and a DC of 38 or less; mine is more power-based, with nekkid AB 45 (buffable 85) and a DC 42(43)(cap: 48) - this one has divines in tact, in lieu of dev. crit (in the event one wishes to play a historical character, but is on a server where dev.crit is banned)<br><br>Then, there's Merlin's and Grim's - they're smiters, unlike this one.  The Thrower is cute, being a dex-based halfling dart thrower, which leaves us with Mistress -a nice pvm character, with a dev.crit DC 30(36 capped), and which doesn't appear to make use of the divines (one of your early(ier) borns, yes? Awww--and cool, indeed; I'll see about the rogue a-re-arranging; back soon <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br>Tyr<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 10/12/06 19:05</span></i></p>

Good build Deb. I like more this non dev crit version, but that's the usual thing for me. <br><br>Starting Rogue is a no brainer: skillpoints are never enough to me. You could go Rogue 4/FTR 6 preepic for a +1 ref save, then I'd either drop LoH for Iron Will and CS for IE <i>or</i>keep CS but drop LoH for Lightning Reflexes to make Evasion more efficient.<br><br>About skills: keep present that a modified 15 score in Set Trap is all you need to set all deadly traps but gas and that with just one rank in Disable Traps you can recover automatically all your traps (the ones you set, that is). Trap setting is very useful, don't ignore it.<br>As pointed out Hide and MS without ESF are maybe wasted cause you'll greatly suffer from the Armor penalty. Drop them and pump Spellcraft some more and get yourself Listen (so that you can "see" invisible creatures) and put points into trap skills.<br><br>Epic Fiendish Servant can be maybe swapped for Epic Reputation (fits the character theme wise) but it's nothing major.<br><br>Also, in this non dev crit version you might want to change the lvl split for Rogue 13/BG 19 so that you can grab both CS and IE, get +1d6 SA and get a handful more skillpoints (+18, not bad) at the cost of Epic Fiendish Servant and some HPs (-12 HPs).<br><br>I was wondering whether the historical Dracula went through some event that changed him, turning him from a champion of good to a twisted soul rejoicing in darkness. In the latter case a Paladin/Blackguard build could be fitting, but not if you go by the PnP books (Paladin status is lost and lvls get transferred to BG IIRC).<br><br>SO that was it. The Dwarflord already pointed out the similar builds and asked you a brief comment on (dis)similarities; please, remember to always do it, as per da rulz <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br>Glad to see you back Deb.

From what I recall of the History Channel special, the historical Vlad Dracula was always a sadist, but he got particularly nasty after being deposed and then returning to power (because of foreign backing) because his successor wasn't doing too well against the Muslim Turk invasions that were threatening the frontier areas of Eastern Europe at the time.  It was during this time that he did most of his worst deeds, probably driven in part by paranoia since he'd already been deposed once.  <br><br>The main reason he got another chance as ruler was because his neighbors wanted to use his country as a "buffer state" between them and the Turks, much like the Soviet Union was using the Warsaw Pact nations (notably East Germany and Poland) as a buffer zone between Russia proper and the West.<br><br>As for the build, I'd drop Divine Might - it's not worth it, you have EWS and a high strength, and can put in a save feat instead (iron will, probably), or extra turning even.  For the 6 turning attempts/day you have, divine shield is the best use IMO.<br><br>Rerranging the rogue levels as suggested will help playability a bit.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Thanks, all. <br><br>Kail, yeah, GD makes some great points (and so do you – and only 15 trap skills you say for all but gas? COOL! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">    (incorporated and how – see, next post, below -- what follows first is a bit more info about this character <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    )<br><br>Character (more on Impaler’s history/theme):<br>Kail – your question is most enlightening (and Xylo -- extremely well done, and thank you!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    !): Vlad Dracula was indeed a fascinating character; although sadism may have played a part, most historians believe that his was a paranoia borne of the times and his personal experiences, in light of what I am sure was nothing short of pure hell for him; his country was under siege, his countrymen ravaged by war and hunger, and yet his so-called court smiling in his presence, all the while plotting ouster behind his back. Having taken a brief respite in foreign lands before reclaiming his power with foreign backing (it was believed he was the only one who could actually get the job done, thus saving Europe from the domino effect), and he did; and he also saw that Romania was not as glorious as it once was, and could still be; thus, he had a dual-purpose, out to modernize his country, no matter the costs while, at the same time of course, pushing the invading Turks out of his country. Hard times (no doubt in his mind) called for “the ends justify the means” tactics, regardless of the means (hence, the blood bath/use of terror tactics, ensuring his court and country didn't dare even think of revolt, while also sending a clear message would-be invaders to stay away, else face horrific consequences of pain and horror by dying slowly, impaled on a pike).<br><br>Medieval Britain used similar tactics, i.e., notorious London bridge, where the Crown was proud to display the severed heads of traitors and criminals, impaled on pikes and dipped in tar as a warning to others; later, during the French Revolution, even Napoleon was not above using terror-tactics -- shooting cannons at random down the streets of Paris, to keep the people (and those who might otherwise disagree) in constant fear for their security/well-being, and therefore in line. Grabbing power by keeping the populace in fear isn't new, but Impaler took these tactics into a downward, evil spiral all own, showing what happens when one has law without justice, on the premise of order for order’s sake alone (and hence, his alignment, which I believe the only fitting, and particularly if you believe some tales, which claim he smiled while bodies decayed, drinking wine and relishing his "work" (hence, sadistic streak).<br><br>At the same, Impaler was determined to save Romania, not only from invading Muslims but also from itself (i.e., to modernize and re-connect his nation to Europe, so as to serve as the gateway from East to West, as Romania once was). That, perhaps, is the biggest irony of all: following his death, his country did in fact thrive, during the Renaissance, its culture alive and flourished as a major producer of all cultural products, especially film. Does might make right? Do the ends justify the means? Was it his heavy-handed tactics or the peoples’ escape therefrom on his death, which was responsible for Romania’s modern rebirth and economic success?  Common themes among despots both back then and in modern times today, insist that only history can be the judge. <br><br>A most chilling thought, indeed.<br><br>AND now, for those modifications:<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 10/17/06 21:24</span></i></p>

Modified Level Guide: Playability you say?!!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    <br><br>Swapped LoH w.

(thanks, GD – also heeding your advice re: starting w. rogue, having been arm-twisted, er, echoed by Sir Kail  (seriously, thanks: well, okay, there’s something nice about starting life off as a fighter (ie. more hps, wear armor, etc.), must admit, when I look at all those extra skills (that be 293 with this, modified version, as compared to 274 before), well, okay, it does make sense (thanks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    <br><br>Trap Skills:<br>In accordance with good information and the advice of Sir Kail (who informs us that 15 points in traps is all one needs to set (all but gas) traps, w. 1 in disable to recover your traps – well, that’s just wonderful (thanks!); with all that in mind, and more points to play with, we refigure as follows:<br><br>Skillpoints: 293 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br>Concentration 39(40)<br>Discipline 40(51)<br>Tumble 40(40)<br>UMD 42(45)<br>Open Lock 1(1)<br>Hide 5(5) * (Connotes BG Prereq.)<br>Spellcraft 13(15) (another +1 vs. spell saves)<br>Taunt 43(49) (53 w.
