With NWN2 under development (and with most of likely to to buy it), we should all be requesting the feature we, character builders, would like the most.  That is to say: <b>the option for maximum HP on level up</b>.  Let's face it, rolling up those max rolls as it stands is painful.  I've started a topic about it the NWN2 forum, it would be nice to get some support from the guild.  After all, the squeaky wheel gets the grease.<br><br><a href="http://nwn2forums.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=407075&amp;forum=98" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
