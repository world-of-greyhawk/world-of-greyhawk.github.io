I'm looking for good PvP builds so please post your favorite. I'd prefer to not play the Exalted Sorceress or a level 40 Wizard, but if something like that is your favorite PvP build please post it. Thanks in advance for any advice <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

That's... hard, there are so many powerful builds in the guild... I guess my favorite is one made by me, no favoritism of course... (other can post their own if they want it so badly, don't look mean at me)... and even taking one of my builds it's hard to choose, it might actually depend on the magical environment. <br><br>Anyway, this might be my strongest build: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "249788", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Magic Master (Monk 2 / Cleric 17 / Wizard 21)</a> but buffing is very troublesome with him, so I generally prefer this other one: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "248564", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Dwarven Abomination (Cleric 17 / Fighter 1 / Dwarven Defender 22)</a><br><br>Chances are, if you say what kind of build you like it's easier we can point you at a strong PVP build built that way... other than that, practically any Fighter/Cleric/Weapon Master makes a great PVP build.

Thanks for the reply Thaxll'ssyllia. OK what kind of build do I like... what kind of build do I like? Good question. I kinda know more of what I don't like to be honest. That would be the pure or purish caster builds. Sorcerers, Wizards, Clerics and Druids should be added to a build for flavor imo, not dominate the build. The only way I'd be happy with a pure, or close to it, caster build is if it was geared towards using a melee weapon. I'm just not happy unless I can hack, slash, stick or bash something <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Also I haven't done any PvP yet, just read about it, so that's why I was looking for builds people here enjoyed PvPing with. I read alot about what would work for a low/med/high magic server. It sounds like clerics are good for low magic servers and weapon masters are good for high magic servers. Apparently mages are good on all? It would be nice to find a build that is melee, or archery, oriented and would work well in any condition. That might not exist, I don't know.<br><br>I don't have any problem with cheese builds, as hear them called. While I can see why they are called that I am too new to the game for anything to seem cheesy to me. I also don't have any problem with changing alignments, in fact I think that would be fun. I think it can add to a character's background.<br><br>I have it stuck in my head that I have to have UMD maxed out. It seems like such a valuable tool, especially for melee builds. I also like the idea of treasure hunting and being able to use the magic items I find along the way. Kinda makes me feel like a medieval Indiana Jones, or something like that?<br><br>I'm up in the air on stealth + sneak damage builds. I think they look like fun but I have know clue how well they perform in pvp.<br><br>That's about it I think. Thanks again for the reply Thaxll'ssyllia.

You could always try a Sorceror/RDD/Pally(Or BG?) build, that can get devastating crits, and also have bigby spells <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Granted, your AB won't be too hot, but with Divine shield and Epic mage armor, your AC certainly will make up for it.<br><br>Edit: Perhaps something like 23 Sorc, 7 Pally (Or BG), 10 RDD.  Granted, the PM variety might be a bit better, but this one is a -tad- bit less common <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By mantis3 on 11/25/06 05:29</span></i></p>

I think 20 pally/4 fighter/ 16 rogue is the best pvp build.<br>_________________<br>They were all dead. The final gunshot was an exclamation mark to everything that had led up to this point.

Here are a few builds I've found here that look interesting to me and seem like they have potential to be good PvP builds. Could you give me a thumbs up or thumbs down on these guys?

Well, if Bard is acceptable for a casting class, you could try something like:<br><br>16 Bard/14 Paladin/10 RDD<br><br>Granted, the alignment shifts would be a pain, but most PvP servers don't have alignment restrictions.  If that was the case, you might sub in BG for Paladin.  And right now, I'm too lazy to search for said builds <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Edit: There are two versios I have tested of the above build, one with Dev. Crit., the other without.  Both had divine shield, and with +5 gear had around 75 AC fully buffed, while the latter subbed in several nice pre-epic feats for devastating critical (switching Divine Might/KD for great cleave).  Either way, you did nice damage, around 57 AB with a +5 weapon, curse song and taunt, and amazing AC.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By mantis3 on 11/26/06 20:36</span></i></p>
