Death attack paralysis will not extend the paralysis time of an already paralyzed creature. Thus one must wait until after the terrifying rage paralysis wears off before conducting a paralysis death attack.

This is an interesting build, and certainly not one for a beginner.  Maybe needs a bit of a play-by-play since it is so unique.  I'm curious about your Unarmed tactic that you go with in pre-epic.  I might actually try to pick up more Wizard levels pre-epic, and try to nail down some Spell Penetration feats.  20 Wizard levels, especially 20 late levels, could probably use a bit more teeth.  It'd also give him a bit more playability as you can actually harness that Int and put it to work up front.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

While the scope is more with the terrifying rage in mind, deflect arrows can still be useful with damage shields employed.

That sounds carefully considered, and makes just enough sense that it could work.  My only suggestion then, would be to take your first mage level up front somewhere, to give him the ability to scroll cast in his early levels when he might need it rather than wait until Level 15.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I did not consider scroll usage when leveling to 15 (I saw the barbarian leveling as solid on its own). The only reason why I had delayed the first wizard level in the build was to take advantage of an extra level one spell by taking the first wizard level after the intelligence raw score reached 20 (First level wizards get to choose 3+int modifier level one spells in addition to all the cantrips).  Of course, early scroll casting is better than an additional level one spell.

Yes, but you can do both.  You can take Barb1 at Level 1 for the skill points, and then take Wizard1 at Level 2.  This will allow the use of wands, scrolls, rods and so on, and will give you an instant +2 bonus to Will Save, as well as allowing an instant Spellcraft dump of 5 which, coupled with your high Int, will give you almost an immediate +1 to +2 to spell saves.  Your pre-epic playability suddenly shoots up 200%.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 10/13/08 22:31</span></i></p>

I would rather take wizard at level three so I can take the spell focus feat.<br><br>And just to clarify the above post was not stating the benefit of taking barbarian at level 1 (which I will probably do no matter what) but rather the mere fact that if you take the first wizard level on or after the level natural int modifier increases you will get another level one spell to select on it.  Granted this in the long run is meaningless as a wizard can learn that spell later by scroll.<br><br><br>So you understand the circumstance I was referring to above:<br>The number of spells a wizard learns at his first wizard level on level-up is all the arcane cantrips, and 3+natural int modifier number of first level spells.  On later wizard levels he can only learn two spells on level-up (this does not count the spells that the wizard can learn from scrolls).
