<b>Playable Level 1-40... Maybe PVM but not really</b><br><br>Here it is, it ties Grimnir's build but it does it in a different way.  This build manages a 100 effective AB (94 Actual [really is a beautiful thing to see <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> ]) in natural areas against opponents with tiny weapons.  Note that if the enemy is not disarmable, and the build can land knockdowns, this is sustainable.  The Taunt score isn't great but against opponents with no concentration (not uncommon with enemies who have no casting abilities) it will get the job done.  I wouldn't recommend playing this build, but it isn't unplayable either.  With a few mods to drop the AB a couple points and boost CON and maybe going human it would be a viable build.<br><br><b>Max effective STR AB</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Half-Orc<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Any non Lawful<br><br><i>Base Attribute</i><br>STR 20  <br>DEX 14 <br>CON 8<br>WIS 8<br>INT 13 <br>CHA 6 <br><br><i>Leveling Guide</i><br>Levels 1-10 Fighter<br>Levels 11-38 Weapon Master<br>Level 39 Druid<br>Level 40 Fighter<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Druid 1<br>Fighter 11<br>Weapon Master 28<br><br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>All 10 attribute bonuses go to STR<br><br><i>Feats</i><br>Level 1: Weapon Focus (Greatsword), Dodge  <br>Level 2: Knockdown<br>Level 3: Mobility<br>Level 4: Weapon Specialization (Greatsword)<br>Level 6: Spring Attack, Expertise<br>Level 8: Whirlwind Attack<br>Level 9: Toughness<br>Level 10: Improved Critical (Greatsword)<br>Level 12: Disarm<br>Level 15: Improved Knockdown<br>Level 18: Improved Disarm<br>Level 21: Great Strength I<br>Level 23: Epic Weapon Focus (Greatsword)<br>Level 24: Great Strength II<br>Level 26: Epic Prowess<br>Level 27: Great Strength III<br>Level 29: Armor Skin<br>Level 30: Great Strength IV<br>Level 32: Epic Toughness I<br>Level 33: Great Strength V<br>Level 35: Epic Toughness II<br>Level 36: Great Strength VI<br>Level 38: Epic Toughness III<br>Level 39: Epic Skill Focus (Taunt)<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 36<br>DEX 14<br>CON 8<br>WIS 8<br>INT 13<br>CHA 6<br><br><i>Final Saves (vs. Spells)</i><br>Fortitude 19 (27) <br>Reflexes 22 (30)<br>Will 15 (23)<br><br><i>AB and Damage</i><br><br>(No buffs, normal Greatsword)<br>54/49/44/39 21+2D6 (15-20 X3)<br><br><i>AC</i> <br>24 (25) (Full Plate, Tower Shield, No Buffs)<br><br><i>Hit Points</i> 458 (Max Every Level)<br> <br><i>Final Skillpoints</i> 131<br>Discipline 42 (55) <br>Intimidate 4 (2)<br>Spellcraft 39 (40)<br>Taunt 21 (29)<br><br><b>Max AB Calculation</b><br>Base AB 30<br>+13 Base STR bonus<br>+1 Weapon Focus<br>+2 Epic Weapon Focus<br>+1 Epic Prowess<br>+1 Superior Weapon Focus<br>+6 Epic Superior Weapon Focus<br>+2 Nature Sense<br>+6 +12 to STR (from items)<br>+20 +20 Greatsword<br>+8 Improved Disarm Vs.

I suppose you could swap toughness for it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  . Though IIRC, the max attribute penalty is -12 so at most -6 to AC (106).  If you don't like including AC penalties (you purist, you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">  ) a 94 AB is still damn impressive, and the highest actual AB possible by a STR build (under contrived situations, granted, but you'll never see a higher roll with a legal character).  If you are only counting long term AB this is the highest STR AB (54).<br><br>The whole AB build posting-spree/competition/whatever that has been going on for the last little while is a solely academic exercise.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 05/10/06 08:49</span></i></p>

Ok, I have been trolling around on the boards and seeing that +20 weapon seems to be the norm for this "contest"<br><br>I would instead post the AB from constants like buffs, + stat items, and such and another AB for the situational enhancements like taunt and knockdown.

There is a build called the damage adept. It was put in the Epic builders guild. It's just as circumstancial as this one. It can do 1 thing, do the most damage possible. But it isn't really playable, less so than this build. It can't really hit much either. But it deserved it's place. So does this.

Technically, if all you're going for with this buid is the maximum possible AB, couldn't you drop some of the unecessary Feats? I'll bold the ones that could be dropped:<br><br>Level 21: Great Strength I<br>Level 23: Epic Weapon Focus (Greatsword)<br>Level 24: Great Strength II<br>Level 26: Epic Prowess<br>Level 27: Great Strength III<br>Level 29: <b>Armor Skin</b><br>Level 30: Great Strength IV<br>Level 32: <b>Epic Toughness I</b><br>Level 33: Great Strength V<br>Level 35: <b>Epic Toughness II</b><br>Level 36: Great Strength VI<br>Level 38: <b>Epic Toughness III</b><br>Level 39: Epic Skill Focus (Taunt)<br><br>Change all the bolded feats to Great Strength and you have a +2 AB gain. Unless these are Bonus Feats that you can't take Great Strength on?<br><br>&lt;edit&gt;<br><br>Yeah, sorry, I looked it up after I posted. I had no idea that Weapon Master couldn't take Great Strength as a Bonus Feat. That's kind of...odd. Looking through I notice that -no- classes have Great Strength as a bonus feat, and I have to ask: "Why not?" There are like four classes that get Great Dexterity.

Realistically if you allow +20 weapons you shouldn't allow better than +9 armor (5 sources of AC boost, vs. 1 source of AB boost, things are pretty much balanced at +5).  Actually, this isn't a half-bad setting.  It means the 1/1 AB classes are actually the best warriors (Wow, who would of thought the classes designed for melee could actually be the best at it?), clerics are about 5 AB behind warriors but still have their healings spells as well as spells with no DCs.  Arcane casters are also powerful thanks to the bigby's spells and IGMS.  It probably equalizes the classes better than any other setting.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

How this character got his +20 AB and +12 str:<br><br>He made another mage character and leveled him up till he took brew potion for a true strike potion!<br><br>He then took his wizard and made bulls str potions in the millions so as to reroll for +5 Str.. Being a level 1 druid he was able to secure millions of Aura of Vitalite scrolls from his Dragon build obviously!<br><br>That's +9 str of course.. so he's in need of +3 more strength to get his ultimate AB vs chickens with small beaks.. well of course his dragon and wizard are one and the same and thus he was able to manufacture cheap potions of Blood Frenzy for +2 of that.<br><br>And to cap it all off, this fighter happened to be a pet to a very pathetic druid who cast Awaken on him.. obviously.. I wasn't running out of ideas..<br><br>And there you have it chaps, a very reliable and reasonable and completely sensible way to get said stat and AB boosts!<br><br>-DaMouse

No bubbles to burst, then again could be off key here, but your ab consists of 4 things: BAB, Stat+ bonus, magical/enchant bonus (Max +20), situation bonuses.  <br><br>I have a pic of a Pally/Cot/Monk with a character screen ab 99/94/89/84 (not including smite (+10) - actual ab on hit was max 72/87/82/77 (not tested to see if smite is not included in the magical/enchantment bonus).

I personally call thet <b>log AB</b>, cause it's what you can see in the logs. Actually you forgot to consider size, smite, bane of enemies and druid woodland stride boni in your classification.<br><br>Here we have been discussing <b>effective AB</b> instead, which is basically log AB plus AC decreasing factors taken into consideration, like curse song and taunt. A mathematical construct? Yes, but nonetheless it reflects your real chances to hit. Anyhow, even if you take the taunt malus to AC away, you are left with 94 log AB in this build, although you'll get in only in specific circumstances: woodland areas, prone opponent with tiny weapons (but not unarmed!) that you are disarming with your highest AB attack.<br><br>Regarding your doubt, no smite together with woodland stride and bane of enemies do not count towards the +20 cap.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?
