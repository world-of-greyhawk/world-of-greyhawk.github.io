I've been working at builds for a while now... but here's my most recent beacon of destruction. Without further ado, the Dragon Defender!<br><br>Race: Dwarf<br><br>Wields: Dragon Creature Weapons<br><br>Stats:<br>Str- 10<br>Dex- 14<br>Con- 10<br>Int- 14<br>Wis- 18 (+10)<br>Cha- 6<br><br>1- Monk<br>2- Druid<br>3- Druid<br>4- Druid<br>5- Druid<br>6- Druid<br>7- Monk<br>8- Monk<br>9- Druid<br>10- Dwarven Defender<br>11- Monk<br>12- Monk<br>13- Monk<br>14- Dwarven Defender<br>15- Druid<br>16- Druid<br>17- Monk<br>18- Dwarven Defender<br>19- Monk<br>20- Dwarven Defender<br>21- Druid<br>22- Monk<br>23- Druid<br>24- Druid<br>25- Druid<br>26- Druid<br>27- Druid<br>28- Druid<br>29- Druid<br>30- Druid<br>31- Druid<br>32- Monk<br>33- Dwarven Defender<br>34- Dwarven Defender<br>35- Monk<br>36- Monk<br>37- Monk<br>38- Monk<br>39- Monk<br>40- Monk<br><br>Feats:<br>1- Luck of Heroes<br>3- Blind Fight<br>6- Toughness<br>9- Dodge<br>12- Mobility<br>15- Spring Attack<br>18- Empower Spell<br>21- Great Wisdom<br>24- Great Wisdom<br>27- Great Wisdom<br>30- Great Wisdom<br>33- Dragon Form<br>36- Armor Skin<br>39- Epic Skill Focus (Discipline)<br><br>Skills:<br><br>Point Total- 242<br>Disicpline-43<br>Heal-33<br>Hide-43<br>Move Silently-43<br>Spellcraft-40<br>Tumble-40<br><br>The first thing notable is the 6 base attacks. SIX ATTACKS! Bare, however, the AB starts at 45. Still, not too shabby. The kicker is, spamming Improved Knockdown, the AB begins at 51 for medium-sizes and 54 for smalls! That's without ANY equipment, either! With a strength of 48, meaning a modifier of 19, that's insane damage as well! Even the AC is amazing, with 46 at level 40 with ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ON! Also, with 18 druid levels, you can get an entire plethora of buffs to slap on your dragon, from the lowly empowered Bull's Strength all the way to Premonition! You also get flurry of blows to add a seventh attack, stunning fist, and all those other awesome level 16 monk abilities! The real secret of this build separating it from run-of-the-mill dragons, though, are the dwarven defender levels. Not only do they provide defensive stance, but also second-tier defensive awareness. In other words, YOU CAN'T BE FLANKED. As long as you're in combat with SOMETHING, those pesky rogues can kiss their insane damage bonuses goodbye! With high hide and move silently, this character can lurk around for loads more fun. Just watch out for those people with True Sight and its ilk. With high spellcraft and tumble, you'll have great saves, great AC, and be able to identify practically any spell and dodge any attack on the run! With such high discipline and your insane size, you'll never have to worry about being knocked down! With high heal, you can always be sure your heal kits will heal somewhere around 50 and not just a pathetic 20. The only possible flaws with this build and its outrageous figures is that it only gets its true power at level 33, pretty late in the game. Unless you're leveling straight to 33+, this can be a pain to get up and running. One last thing to note is Mord's Disjunction. It won't knock you out of Dragon Form at least, but it will strip all your buffs, taking you down a couple pegs. You should still be able to fight well regardless, though. I highly doubt anything short of an insane mage or divine build will be able to take this fledgling down.<br><br>To recap-<br>PROS:<br>-6 attacks<br>-51/54 starting AB bare<br>-46 AC bare<br>-Tons of Buffs<br>-Defensive Stance<br>-Defensive Awareness (NO FLANKING!)<br>-Monk Abilities<br>-High skills<br>CONS:<br>-Only good at level 33+<br>-Vulnerable to Mord's<br><br>Note: All figures are in Dragon Form.<br><br>Edited By Speccer on 03/05/04 22:25:57<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 16:21</span></i></p>
