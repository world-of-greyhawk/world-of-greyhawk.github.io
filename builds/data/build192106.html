No, it's my bad, I had suggested switching cleave/great cleave for the knockdown feats, then realized you of course couldn't do that and get dev crit..  I was editing my post, and ended up deleting it, but not before the reply was sent.  Sorry for the confusion.  This is a very cool build actually.  I'm looking for a new series of modules to try it out with.  I like the way it sacrifices ridiculously high bow AB for good enough AB in bow and melee.  Nice to be able to pull the enemy in with your bow, and if he hasn't died yet, crush his skull in, <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> .<br><br>Steve

The build could be altered to get Knockdown as well as 2 extra ranged AB. It could be changed to 8 Bard/10 RDD/22 AA, 7 Bard/4 RDD/9 AA pre epic.

Yeah, but you'd lose some bard song niceness (+2AC and an addition +1 to skills), as well as 4th level bard spells (Improved Invisibility and War Cry).  I'd prefer that to knockdown, especially if I wasn't going to have improved knockdown to go with it.  So I'd stick with your original version.  One change I could make though, would be to take the penultimate level level as Arcane Archer instead of Bard.  So you end 11 Bard/10 RDD/19 AA.  You'd get one more ranged AB, and you'd only really lose a few unnecessary skill points (probably from Heal, and you can drop two points from perform anyway due to your +2 CHA modifier), since Bard Song doesn't improve from level 11 to 12.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 04/26/05 00:34</span></i></p>

I know I am being a lazy bastard for asking this but how would I go about to useing solely on the bow?  what should be change and so on and is RDD a must if not focusing on both melee and ranged?  also not wanting to have dev crit (for both rp and restriction on server)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Aretal on 04/29/05 06:45</span></i></p>

A pure archer build can get a much higher AB than this build would, and you could certainly do without the RDD in this case.<br><br>Steve
