Jharen sensed the wyrm coming even before he saw his shadow circling the war-torn battlefield.  He cast a last few defensive spells and awaited his foe; his stomach growing uneasy as the beast grew larger by the second.<br><br>With a creaking of tendons, the great dragon slowed his decent and dropped to the earth; sending clouds of dust and debris into the air.<br><br>"So, you little bastard, you did survive" it growled, glancing at the remains of his once-prowd army. He paused, "A pity your White Riders did not", at the same time dropping a handful of bloodied robes, bones and trinkets to the ground. "You were a fool to send them against me. You always did over-estimate yourself and your companions".<br><br>Jharen's heart sank.  When he had seen the armies of the Red Fang coming over the hills, instead of their namesake, he had feared the worst.  His companions were not prepared to handle such a powerful dragon. He had been certain that the dragon would be coming here instead. He had erred, and his friends had paid the price.  He calmed himself, knowing the intention was to unnerve him.  He forced himself to smile, eyeing the dragon up and down "Well, at least their families will live well with the gold that your hide will bring in!"<br><br>The beast said nothing, but it's eyes glowed with an intensity born of power and hate.  Then without word, it sprang at Jharen, its claws ripping up the earth as it sprang.<br><br>Jharen  met the attack, dodging claws and raining blows upon the lizard.  Within seconds, however, he realized he was overmatched. The dragon hit him repeatedly, weakening and destroying his protections, while Jharen could do only minor damage.  The beast was strong, far stronger than any dragon he had faced.  He had inadvertently sent his friends to their deaths and would quickly follow himself.<br><br>The dragon bellowed with triumph as a well placed hit sent Jharen flying across the ground; plowing aside the armor, weapons, and body parts from the previous battle.  "Well," the dragon gloated, coming up to the coughing and bloodied human "I was expecting more from you; the man who decimated my armies". "But then, you always were a disapointment. Perhaps I'll just send you to my slave pits instead of killing you outright. You might enjoy the sight of me feasting on the townsfolk you were hoping to save!".<br><br>The dragon stalked closer. "You're going to have to beg for your life a little louder than that". He mocked, then also noticed Jharen's subtle hand motions and realization sparked. He roared and lashed out his claws to crush and stop the spellcasting.  But, before the blow landed, his claw stopped a foot from Jharen's head. Indeed, everything stopped, birds, flies, and the wind itself.<br><br>Jharen quickly put as much ground between him and the great wyrm before the spell released the flow of time. Then quickly cast it again, as the dragon was momentarily taken aback as the man had disappeared under his grasp.<br><br>Then with a urgency born of desperation, Jharen began casting.  His motions and utterances causing the very air to waver with the arcane forces that he was unleashing. Then, he felt the Timestop give way, and a surge of power washed over him as a torrent of arcane might flew from Jharen and pounded into to dragon.<br><br>As the air exploded in light, blood and pain, the dragon realized his doom.  In a fit of rage, he rushed headlong at the mage. Pushing through the onslaught of magic, hoping to crush him as quickly as possible. <br><br>To his credit the beast got within a few yards, before his rent flesh and battered bones gave way to the inevitable. Then, with a last bellow, the dragon crashed to the ground in a cloud of dust and smoke; the magic having done what no sword could hope to.  <br><br>Jharen sank to ground himself, completely spent from both the battle and the arcane release. He reached into his pack for a healing potion, only then realizing the extent of his injuries. A sudden coughing bout caused him to nearly pass out as he began throwing up blood onto the ground.  He pulled the cork from the bottle and drank down the liquid, feeling it begin to knit together his wounds.<br><br>Then after dressing many of his cuts and gashes, he paused and stared deep into the dragon's now-darkened eyes. Giving a curt nod of his head, he said quietly . "Farewell father, may you rot in the abyss..."<br><br>_____________________<br><br>Might &amp; Magic (Wizard 26 / Bard 4 / RDD 10)<br><br>Playable 1-40, PvM<br>Any Non-Lawful alignment<br><br>Human<br><br>Str 16 (36)<br>Dex 14<br>Con 14 (16)<br>Wis 8<br>Int 15 (24)<br>Cha 8 (10)<br><br>1 Wizard 1 - (Illusionist), Toughness, Weapon Prof: Martial<br>2 Wizard 2<br>3 Wizard 3 - Weapon Focus: Great Sword<br>4 Wizard 4 - INT 16<br>5 Wizard 5 - Spell Penetration*<br>6 Wizard 6 - Empower Spell<br>7 Wizard 7<br>8 Wizard 8 - INT 17<br>9 Bard 1 - Power Attack<br>10 RDD 1<br>11 RDD 2<br>12 RDD 3 - Cleave, STR 19<br>13 RDD 4<br>14 Wizard 9<br>15 Wizard 10 - Greater Spell Penetration*<br>16 Wizard 11 - STR 22<br>17 Wizard 12<br>18 Wizard 13 - Maximize Spell<br>19 Wizard 14<br>20 Bard 2 - STR 23<br><br>21 Wizard 15 - Epic Weapon Focus: Great Sword, Great Intelligence I*<br>22 Wizard 16<br>23 RDD 5<br>24 RDD 6 - Epic Prowess, STR 24<br>25 RDD 7<br>26 RDD 8<br>27 RDD 9 - Great Strength I, (INT 20)<br>28 Wizard 17 - STR 26<br>29 Wizard 18<br>30 RDD 10 - Great Strength II<br>31 Bard 3<br>32 Wizard 19 - STR 32<br>33 Wizard 20 - Great Strength III, Great Intelligence II*<br>34 Wizard 21<br>35 Wizard 22<br>36 Wizard 23 - Great Strength IV, Great Intelligence III*, STR 35<br>37 Wizard 24<br>38 Wizard 25<br>39 Wizard 26 - Great Strength V, Great Intelligence IV*<br>40 Bard 4 - INT 24<br><br>AB 38 - [BAB 21 + STR 13 + WF 1 + EWF 2 + EP 1]<br>AC 25 - [Base 10 + DEX 2 + Tumble 8 + RDD 5]<br><br>buffed<br>AB 47 - [39 + GMW 5 + Emp.

I chose Bard isntead of Sorc to give skill point dumps in Tumble and Discipline (and perhaps UMD for Cleric and Monk stuff).<br><br>While Sorcerer would have made more sense in terms of synergy, I prefer the Wizard's flexible spellbook. Especially when needing a combination of melee and offensive spells.  Also, there were quite a few other builds of that nature already in the guild.<br><br>Of course, the problem with putting 14 non-Wizard classes in a Wizard build, is that it really dilutes the Wizards buffing and offensive casting ability.  So I tried to spread things out enough and make the breaks at semi-logical times to maximize playability. <br><br>The basic tactics for this build would be buff for combat and melee the cannon fodder, saving the damage spells for the boss.  Since your spell DC's will be in the toilet, you will need to focus on no-save spells, such as IGMS, Bigby, etc. <br><br>I don't care for how long it takes to develop the spellcasting side, but you get spell level 7 at CL 18 so at least you can spam IGMS if need be.<br><br>The AB isn't real great, but it should be more than adequate for the nameless mobs.  And as the story hopefully illustrated, what you can't melee, you fry with magic. Oh, and that was my first attempt at a longer-lengthed story, so please be kind <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>The AC is also very weak, but with buffs and such it shouldn't be too bad. As a secondary option, you could Focus on a one-handed weapon and use a Tower Shield for extra AC. Just quickslot it, for quick spellcasting.<br><br>There is one other build using these classes, but it is focused on getting the maximum Intelligence and maximum spell DC; and so quite a bit different altogether.<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "236961", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Spellfire, a max-INT Wizard /Wizard 29/Bard 2/RDD 9</a><br><br>It would be easy enough to get Epic Warding, you would just trade a Great Intelligence out for it.

Very impressive, I like it. I'd be tempted to get more RDD level pre-epic, though. More AB and earlier attribute increases. Wizard 8/Bard 3/RDD 9 sounds ideal for me. You'd get one more BAB, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>I'd also drop PA and Cleave.<br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 10/18/06 16:23</span></i></p>

On a second look, I'd drop INT to 20 and get AutoStill and Armor Skin. That would give 34 AC unbuffed, I figure (with plate &amp; shield).<br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 10/18/06 18:48</span></i></p>

I like this build, too.  It's a bit outside the box, and pretty original.  I think Autostill is the way to go as well, and just stopping with a 20 Int.

FinneousPJ, is there a particular reason you go Bard 3 before going RDD 10?  It seems far more beneficial to pick up the extra RDD level earlier than to get the +1 AC from tumble, andtaking the skill dump a little later to spread it out seems like it would make the skills more beneficial for 1-40 play through.

Both Bard3 and RDD10 gives another point of BAB. He'd have one more level to use skilldumps in epic with only 2 bard levels pre-epic, but now we are suddenly discussing the wrong build. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.
