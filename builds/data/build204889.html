Nothing terribly original here, but I'm having a lot of fun with this character. <b>Playable 1-40 PvM.</b> (I hope so - I'm playing this on a low XP world!). Advice is very welcome.<br><br>Taking one level of SD for HIPS is considered cheesey by a lot of people. You could substitute SD levels for rogue in this build if you wanted to round her out, but it wouldn't net you any advantages. If you dropped SD entirely, then it would reduce your ability to solo but increase your AB if you took another fighter level.<br><br>I took a look at the Bioware featured "Devastating Rogue" AFTER working out this build. He's very impressive, with a massive sneak attack, but I think this is more playable at pre-epic levels.<br><br>Objectives:<br>Full rogue capabilities, within reason<br>Able to solo if no party is available<br>Maintain playability at all levels - no "lvl 40 - bard: 40 points into UMD and Tumble"<br><br>Advantages:<br>15d6 sneak attack + HIPS + 6 attacks + 17-20 devastating crit + crippling strike = watch out!<br>WS + EWS + good STR makes non-crit/non-sneak damage OK.<br>Good AB/HP for a rogue<br>Superior Initiative<br>Full rogue capabilities from about level 8<br><br>Disadvantages:<br>Low will saves (slippery mind helps, but look out for a Golden Circlet!)<br>Low fortitude saves (God help you against a big spider with true sight)<br>Poor chances against opponents with True Sight e.g. dragons<br>Cheesey SD level - HIPS should really be a rogue epic feat IMHO.<br>AB is not optimal - thanks to the SD level there's no "rule of 4 per class" - but this is a rogue with some fighter levels, so that's the price you pay.<br>Low AC compared to most rogues - you'll probably wear a chain shirt unless you can find DEX-enhancing items<br>Discipline could be maxed if you took Fighter at level 40, but I don't think you need it, and you'd lose 1d6 sneak attack and 6 skill points by doing so.<br><br>Rogue(25), Fighter(14), Shadowdancer(1), Human, any alignment<br><br>STR: 16 (28)<br>DEX: 16<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>01: Ro(1): Ambidexterity, Two-Weapon Fighting (You can put 4 skill points into all the rogue skills)<br>02: F(1): Weapon Focus: Shortsword (only put skill points into discipline on fighter levels, save the rest)<br>03: F(2): Dodge, Mobility<br>04: F(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>05: F(4): Weapon Specialization: Shortsword<br>06: F(5): Toughness<br>07: Ro(2) (get Hide, MS, Tumble to 10 here - you have loads of skill points)<br>08: SD(1): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>09: Ro(3): Improved Initiative<br>10: Ro(4)<br>11: F(6): Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>12: F(7): STR+1, Improved Critical: Shortsword, (STR=19)<br>13: F(8): Power Attack<br>14: Ro(5)<br>15: Ro(6): Cleave<br>16: Ro(7): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>17: Ro(8)<br>18: Ro(9): Great Cleave<br>19: Ro(10): Slippery Mind<br>20: Ro(11): STR+1, (STR=21)<br>21: F(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Shortsword<br>22: F(10): Epic Weapon Specialization: Shortsword<br>23: F(11)<br>24: Ro(12): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR=23)<br>25: F(12): Overwhelming Critical: Shortsword<br>26: Ro(13): Crippling Strike<br>27: F(13): Great Strength II, (STR=24)<br>28: F(14): STR+1, Devastating Critical: Shortsword, (STR=25)<br>29: Ro(14)<br>30: Ro(15): Armor Skin<br>31: Ro(16): Superior Initiative<br>32: Ro(17): STR+1, (STR=26)<br>33: Ro(18): Epic Fortitude<br>34: Ro(19): Improved Sneak Attack I<br>35: Ro(20)<br>36: Ro(21): STR+1, Epic Will, (STR=27)<br>37: Ro(22)<br>38: Ro(23)<br>39: Ro(24): Epic Prowess, Improved Sneak Attack II<br>40: Ro(25): STR+1, (STR=28)<br><br><br>Hitpoints: 378<br>Skillpoints: 387<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 24/18/24<br>BAB: 26<br>AB (max, naked): 39 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br>AC (naked): 23 <br><br>Disable Trap 40(42), Discipline 31(40), Hide 40(43), Listen 40(39), Move Silently 40(43), Open Lock 40(43), Search 40(42), Spot 18(17), Tumble 40(43), UMD 40(39) + 28 spare points for other bits and pieces<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 07/28/05 15:55</span></i></p>
