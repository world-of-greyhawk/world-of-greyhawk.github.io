I want to make a Paladin character that has seen his share of battle, and has fought all kinds of evil. He is reaching high into senior years, and is increasing in Wisdom... but the Keep he had belonged to now ridicules his teachings and things of him as a wandering heretic, and one who has fallen from grace. However, in truth, he is just controvercial in his beliefs and is challenging in his words.<br><br>He wanders now from city to city, hoping to find a youth who would be open-minded to the teachings that he considers true, and to shield them from the conformists in the churches, and preserve "True Good" from being corrupted.<br><br>The character would appear to just be some old, irritable man who often sits at taverns, away in the corner, not even drinking. The kind of man that has all sorts of amazing stories about his past, though everyone who hears them will laugh and call him a liar and washed up old farmer.<br><br>My question is, what class combination best suits this? I was thinking Paladin for the base class because that is his history, and was his life, though he really could be just a Knight involving any class-combination... though not a primary caster such as Wizard. Alignment shifts are not possible.<br><br>I was thinking that if it were not Paladin, it would be Bard. As since the Knight has retired, he has made it his goal to spread knowledge and ideals, and that is something fitting for a Bard. However a Bard does not have the martial abilities to back-up all the things this character has experienced in his own history.<br><br>Weapon Master is a possibility, though they are kind of boring to me. <br><br>Rogue would make a good secondary class, as he is somewhat of a Rogue Knight who after being expelled from his order, had to learn many new skills to preserve his own life while travelling. <br><br>Anyone who has read this far, willing to share ideas?

Maybe I'm just thinking LotR (Aragorn <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ) but I think a Ranger would suit your concept. Maybe Ranger/Bard since you mention Bard.<br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 01/31/07 19:41</span></i></p>

Pally/Rogue/CoT is a pretty solid combination... A build like that can go any way... STR, CHA... even DEX based.

For roleplay. I'd say this is a lawful good paladin turning chaotic good.<br>He now has increased wisdom (though I doubt it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  )and is more into teaching and preaching than smithing.<br><br>For classes, I think cleric is quite close - still close to his god, even if not to the order.<br><br>He might even leave the order for a new one, closer to his new way of seeing things, becoming a Harper Scout.<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 02/06/07 11:39</span></i></p>
