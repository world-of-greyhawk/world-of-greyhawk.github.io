"Rakel, go on ahead.  Scout out the opposition."  Dorium needed to know what was lurking around the next corner, and after all, Rakel was an expert in such matters, not he.<br>"Why do I always get the dangerous part?" exclaimed the halfling.<br>"Just do it!  You ARE an expert after all.  What could happen?"<br>"What if I find something I can't handle?!"<br>Dorium sighed.<br>"Fine.  Ethillar, go with her."<br>"Very well," replied a hooded figure, clad in plate.<br>Rakel exhaled in relief, shortly before disappearing into the shadows.  Knowing that this mysterious figure was with her, Rakel could focus on the job at hand.<br><br>The idea of this build was to make someone who could sneak along with a rogue, even in plate if circumstances need, and be able to dish out high damage to mobs of sneak attack immune and critical hit immune monsters.  This dual wielding ranger can also fill other roles in a party, from a limited archer (after buffing), to a front line fighter, to a limited healer and negotiator.  Also, in accompanying a stealthy, dex-based char, you would need a better than average will save, since the rogue might very well get hosed by something like that.  I also wanted to be able to take advantage of EWS by using TWF.  This requires buffing and hide armor, but it is sufficient for most purposes.  It should be noted that in order to do the most damage, this char will need to wear Hide Armor, otherwise the AB is a lower.<br><br>I really like Rangers, and Harper Scouts.  To my surprise, they combined well enough to create a pretty versatile character.  By making full use of HS and Ranger spells, this char can fill a number of roles.  There is one other build using these classes, the Harper Ranger.  The focus of that build was different enough from mine that I thought I could post.<br><br><br>Rogue's Companion<br>Ranger 31, Fighter 4, HS 5<br>Human<br><br><b>PvM, playable 1 to 40</b><br><br>str 16 to 26<br>dex 10<br>con 14 to 16<br>int 14<br>wis 14<br>cha 8<br><br>1  Ranger1 Luck of Heroes, Strong Soul, Fav En: Undead<br>2  Fighter1 Weap Foc: Handaxe<br>3  Ranger2 Iron Will<br>4  Ranger3<br>5  Ranger4<br>6  Ranger5 Fav En: Elementals, Stealthy<br>7  Ranger6<br>8  Fighter2 Impr Crit: Handaxe<br>9  Ranger7 KD<br>10 Ranger8<br>11 Ranger9<br>12 Ranger10 IKD, Fav En: Outsiders<br>13 Fighter3<br>14 Ranger11<br>15 Ranger12 Toughness<br>16 Ranger13<br>17 Ranger14<br>18 Ranger15 Fav En: Dragons, Alertness<br>19 Ranger16<br>20 Ranger17<br>21 Ranger18 EWF: Handaxe<br>22 HS1 ESF: Move Silently<br>23 Ranger19<br>24 Fighter4 WS, EWS<br>25 HS2<br>26 Ranger20 Fav En: Constructs<br>27 HS3 Epic Will<br>28 Ranger21<br>29 Ranger22<br>30 Ranger23 Bane of Enem, Epic Prowess<br>31 Ranger24<br>32 HS4<br>33 Ranger25 Fav En: Dwarves, Great Con I<br>34 Ranger26 Fav En: Human<br>35 Ranger27<br>36 Ranger28 Great Con II<br>37 HS5 ESF: Hide<br>38 Ranger29 Fav En: Gnomes<br>39 Ranger30 Fav En: Halflings, Armor Skin<br>40 Ranger31<br><br>Animal Companion: Dire Boar or Brown Bear or Panther, depending on who travels with you.

I copied over the older version, where i knew i forgot something.  In this post, please replace the FE at level 26 with Constructs, and then the level 34 FE with Humans.

Maybe, actually, you should keep giants and drop gnomes, since they are rare as opponents.  i chose gnomes and halfling to counteract the small stature bonuses, also due to gnomes and dwarves high constitution (usually).  humans is a good choice since everyone and their brother is a human.  of course, the FE are totally up to the player, but definately choose constructs before any player races, unless you are pvping.<br><br>thank for the catch, my queen.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger."

yes, I think in the end choice depends where you're playing<br>when designing modules or PWs I don't think Halflings or Gnomes get chosen as foes very often but humans, elves (Drow) and dwarves (Duegar) do but in PvP (which I've never played) they would be useful<br>I sometimes pick Aberrations (some really tough opponents in that group) or Vermin (I hate spiders) but only if I've got the main groups covered already<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.
