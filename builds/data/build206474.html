Here is a build I made a while ago.

Shadow Dancer<br><br>Ac: 20 (Without Buffs)<br>Hp: 248 (without Buffs)<br>Saves: Fort: 19, Ref: 19, Will: 21<br><br>This build has focused on stealth and spell casting. Though the DC for the spells are moderate the ability to cast spells while in stealth mode is a deadly combination. The automatic silent and quicken spells add to this ideal. As far as I know silent spells dont allow for a spellcraft check to the opponent therefore no added saves to the spells. As when casting the spells his location is not revealed. That means no initiative checks unless they have true seeing. Quicken spells are unable to be interrupted and with Improved Combat Casting there are no attacks of opportunities. Add this with max. out tumble he can move around in battle with ease<br><br>Spells:<br>I will have to add this later. However he can get a +18 to spell saves. He has evasion so if he is successful in his saves he can avoid damage. I tank up by casting maximised Tensers Tranformation (added hp, Saves and Ac), combined with Epic Warding and Epic Mage Armour he becomes devastating. I will give the full buffed stats later. Due to his stealth I took the spell Black Blade of Disaster for added carnage. I have also max. out IGMS.<br><br>I will update this post soon <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Please can I have any feedback

Here are the ins and outs of the build.<br><br>Saves: Fort 18, Ref 18, Will 22<br>Fully Buffed (including Tensers Transformation): Fort 28 Ref 25 Will 25<br><br>He can add a +18 to saves vs spells by buffing with foxs cunning and protection from spells.<br><br>Skills: <br>Concentration 42<br>Lore 43<br>Spellcraft 42<br>Hide 43<br>Move Silently 43<br>Tumble 43<br>Heal 43<br>Search 43<br>Discipline 14<br><br>HP Fully Buffed (including Tensers Transformation): 636<br>AC Fully Buffed (including Tensers Transformation &amp; EMA): 55<br><br>Special Abilities:<br>Uncanny Dodge 1<br>Evasion<br>Hide in Plain Sight<br>Summon Familiar: Panther (adds to the ideal of the build)<br><br>Attack Bonus in Tensers Transformation:<br>+49/+44 (plus 1 more attack from haste)<br><br>Spells:<br>Due to the automatic silent spells he can cast them even when silenced. The spells listed are those used for buffing and so free spell slots can be used for any other spell desired and because he has learned all spells there is a huge list to choose from.<br>LvL 1: Mage Armour, Extended Resistance<br>LvL 2: Owls Wisdom, Invisibility<br>LvL 3: Extended Cats Grace<br>LvL 4: Extended Haste, Improved Invisibility<br>LvL 5: Maximised Bulls Strength, Maximised Endurance, Maximised Foxs Cunning, Extended Elemental Shield, Energy Buffer<br>LvL 6: Extended Mestils Acid Sheath, Globe of Invunerability<br>LvL 7: Shadow Shield, Protection From Spells<br>LvL 8: Premonition, Mind Blank, Greater Sanctuary<br>LvL 9: Greater Spell Mantle, Maximised Tensers Transformation, Mordenkainens Disjunction, Black Blade of Disaster<br><br>Itmes:<br>This should focus on HP, AC, Intelligence and saving throws. A powerful robe and staff is mundane for any wizard.<br><br>As usual any feedback would be great.

Neat build.  Two questions:<br><br>1. Can you HIPS while tensored? <br>2. Why not take auto-still so you can cast while HIPS? I believe that's possible.

Its a skill so just activate it through the radial menu.<br>2. That would be a good build but that means freeing up 4 feats. But due to the ideal of the build I'm unsure what to free up as each feat in the epic levels are essential. What would you suggest?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Jehoshua on 08/02/05 09:26</span></i></p>
