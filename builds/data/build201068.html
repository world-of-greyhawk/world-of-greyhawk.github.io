<b>Playable from level 1 - 40  ..PvM  Build</b><br><br>Harper Protector<br><br>In the service to - and champion of - his deity, the Harper Protector is also a member of the secret Harper society.

As well, they'll all be boosted from the various ability buffs.<br><br>As with most builds, pure casters are going to be a concern, as they'll be able to debuff him.<br><br>One note: You'll have to focus in a simple weapon in order to access the CoT prestige class, which is somewhat distasteful. However, the bulk of your damage is coming from other sources than your base weapon, so that's not too much of a sacrifice. For those who wish to take a martial focus, one solution is to focus in a martial weapon as well at your first CoT level. You'll have to sacrifice either Extend or Empower Spell, and you'll be effectively wasting a feat (the first focus), but it's an option.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 06/23/05 19:59</span></i></p>

Nice build, Cin.  You are right in recognizing that his weapon choice is "distasteful."  I think you can mitigate that some in that there are some good Maces in the OCs, but can't speak for the rest of the Multiverse.  However, trading Extend Spell for Martial, though intially attractive, may not be the wisest course of action.  I think he gets a base amount of 11 Divine Mights and/or Shields a day, and then with his Stacking Empowered Eagles Splendours, he'll cap out with some nice damage.  Using a spear would be a way to go, but I think this guy would need a shield if I'm not mistaken.  So, best consign oneself to the Morning Star or Mace.<br><br>I think this is a fairly balanced character, can hold his own in any given situation, versatile, good-looking, but beware of Weapon Masters!<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I figure the choice of weapon is moot, as the damage is predominantly from other sources and doesn't rely on crits (and personally, I'd accept my fate and not bother with the Martial feat - but the option's there). Definitely I'd go sword and board with this guy. It's not an uber build by any means, but I feel it's reasonably solid.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
