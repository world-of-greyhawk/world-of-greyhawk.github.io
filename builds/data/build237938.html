Paladin 38 seems a little much. Go with paladin 37 and rogue 2 and you get evasion. Seems like that has more of an edge to it.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

Gonna cast Truestrike wearing full plate and a tower shield?  Probably not with any degree of success.  Switch out sorc for cleric (for the spellcraft dump), and take some domains that grant additional racial types to your turn undead ability--which is MASSIVE.  All you need is one level of cleric for the additional turning benefits.  I would recommend Sun (for even better turning) and Destruction (killing constructs at will), but Good, Plant, or any of the elemental domains would help.<br>_________________<br>Vulcano's <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&amp;id=6522" target="_blank">Bard Studio</a> (in beta, 1.67).  *Updated*  Compose, play, and save your own bard music dynamically in game!
