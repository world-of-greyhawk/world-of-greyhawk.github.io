Ok, so I was thinking about how to make the ultimate character, and I thought: What about a character that could cast both Arcane AND Divine spells? At 9th lvl? And have a decent AB to boot? So I played around with the idea for a while, and came up with this:<br><br>Mystic Archer<br><br>Wizard 17/Cleric 17/AA 6<br><br>Race: Half-Elf<br><br>Starting Stats:<br><br>Str: 14<br>Dex: 10<br>Con: 14<br>Int: 16<br>Wis: 14<br>Cha: 8<br><br>Ending Stats:<br><br>Str: 14<br>Dex: 10<br>Con: 14<br>Int: 20<br>Wis: 20<br>Cha: 8<br><br>Cleric Domains: Str. and Healing (recommended)<br>Wiz. School: Illusion<br><br>Level Progression:<br><br>1 Wiz - Weapon Prof.: Martial, [bonus] Combat Casting<br>2 Wiz<br>3 Cleric - Zen Archery<br>4 Cleric (+1 Wis)<br>5 Cleric<br>6 Cleric - Point Black Shot<br>7 Cleric<br>8 Cleric (+1 Wis)<br>9 Cleric - Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>10 Cleric<br>11 Cleric<br>12 Cleric - Imp Critical: Longbow OR Extend Spell (+1 Wis)<br>13 Cleric<br>14 Cleric<br>15 AA - Toughness<br>16 AA (+1 Wis)<br>17 AA<br>18 AA - Still Spell<br>19 AA<br>20 AA (+1 Wis)<br>21 Cleric - Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>22 Cleric<br>23 Cleric<br>24 Cleric - Epic Prowess (+1 Wis)<br>25 Cleric<br>26 Wiz<br>27 Wiz - Auto-Still Spell 1<br>28 Wiz - [bonus] Auto-Still Spell 2 (+1 Int)<br>29 Wiz<br>30 Wiz - Auto-Still Spell 3<br>31 Wiz<br>32 Wiz (+1 Int)<br>33 Wiz - Imp. Combat Casting, [bonus] Spell Penetration<br>34 Wiz<br>35 Wiz<br>36 Wiz - Greater Spell Penetration (+1 Int)<br>37 Wiz<br>38 Wiz - [bonus] Epic Spell Penetration<br>39 Wiz - Epic Skill Focus:Discipline<br>40 Wiz (+1 Int)<br><br>Skills:<br><br>Concentration 25<br>Spellcraft 43<br>Tumble 20 (CC skill = 40 pts)<br>Heal 43<br>Discipline 30 (CC skill = 40 pts + Epic Skill Focus)<br>Lore 43<br>------------------<br>Total Skills ~ 234<br><br>Ok, so if you break it down, what you get is a character who can cast 9th lvl Wiz and Cleric spells while wearing Heavy Armor (or any armor for that matter) and shooting things with his longbow. Pre-epic BAB is 16, meaning you get a solid 4 attacks per round without buffs. With Haste and Divine Power that should increase to 6 attacks per round, and if you wanted to add in Rapid Shot (I left it out because it lowers AB), you could get up to 7 attacks per round with this char.<br><br>As for AB:<br><br>BAB: 26<br>+5 from Wis<br>+1 (min) from Owl's Wisdom<br>+4 from WF, EWF, and EP<br>+3 from Divine Power<br>+5 from Divine Favor<br>+5 from Greater Magic Weapon<br>+2 from Battletide<br>+1 from Prayer<br>-----------------------------<br>52 AB with a normal Longbow (55 w/ True Strike)<br><br>This character should have excellent Will saves, and decent Fort. and Reflex saves as well (not sure how to calculate saves). Health should range from 160 (all rolls = 1) to 372 (all rolls = max). Endurance should add 40-80 points of health, giving you a new range of 200-452, without any equipment.<br><br>For those of you without SoU, here is a fun variation on this char:<br><br>Race: Dwarf<br><br>Druid 17/Fighter 6/Wiz 17<br><br>For stats, add 2 to Con. and subtract 2 from Cha.<br><br>Start as a druid, then multiclass to a fighter. Don't take any Wiz lvls until you hit lvl 24 to minimize the XP penalty. Use a heavy crossbow rather than a longbow. As for fighter feats, I recommend Rapid Reload (or Rapid Shot), Weapon Spec., Imp. Weapon Spec, Imp. Critical, and Called Shot (you get 4 feats from the Fighter lvls + you free up 1 feat by not taking Weapon Prof.: Martial).<br><br>This version actually has more health and does more damage, although you sacrifice 3 points of AB by not taking any AA lvls. You get enough extra skill points from the Druid lvls to be able to take another skill, and you can still wear heavy armor because of your Fighter lvls.<br><br>Although it seems to me that the Druid is generally weaker than the Cleric, I thought this was an interesting variation, and Druids do have a nice little spell called Nature's Balance which lowers your enemies SR and heals your allies at the same time. You also get access to Wildshape and an animal companion, which IMHO is much better than the Wiz. familiar.<br><br>So what do you think?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 10/12/07 20:01</span></i></p>
