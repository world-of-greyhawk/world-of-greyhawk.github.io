<b>Aaaaarrrrr SWEAR it's playable Pvm 1-40. You disaggrrrrreeee?</b><br><br>My version of the infamous Battleragers of Faerun, called Kuldjargh's (axe-idiots) by the Dwarves.<br>It's a fitting name, all-out offense, with little thought for defense. Fury fueling their spirit and battle prowess, attacking without regards to own safety, they are battle-hardened and can deal massive damage, but also withstand extreme punishment. Their only mission is to wade into opponents, scaring them witless while hacking them to pieces. If they loose a pint or two of blood, so be it. Their passion is for battle, and that at least, they are good at.

No other builds with these classes. I feel it has unfulfilled potential somehow, but since I try  for so much the end result isn't half bad. Nice damage, decent saves, even his will save can get somewhat useful. Crappy AC, but 704+ hitpoints and 14 DR should help a lot. Terrifying rage at DC=44. Oh, and he's got UMD. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     <br><br>Matures a little late in some areas. No Epic prowess, can drop 2 GrSTR for Epic prowess and ESF: intimidate. Some people would want Taunt, but with it's hard to get it all so Taunt had to go. And sadly an experience penalty starting at lvl 12.

This dwarf needs to be played wearing no armor imo. He looks like a Dwarven Slayer from Warhammer to me. Cool build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
