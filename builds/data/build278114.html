Ok so this is my first posting of a build here so be nice.<br>The original idea was from R.A. Salvatore's books about Drizzt Do'Urden, whom becomes physically involved with a human (Catti-Brie) and what there hypothetical child would by like if raised by and trained to fight by wulfgar(barbarian) and his mother (fighter-bow specialist) and not his/her father. After so many builds (I can't count the amount, I deleted 86 builds yesterday, or the day before and most were some type of version of this) I figured I would post one of the more balanced one's. <br>I do know that this isn't the most uber build but no one (to my knowledge) has posted a build with this combination (hopefully someone will outdo this one).<br><br>Build Name: Overwhelming Thunder (Do'Urden Kin)<br>Gender: Builder preference<br>Race: Half Elf<br>Alignment: Anything non-lawful<br>Play Mode: PVM or Party Play <br><br>BRB(21)/SOR(1)/AA(18)<br>    <br>      stats<br>starting/ending <br>str 16  / 25<br>dex 13  / 14<br>con 16<br>wis 08<br>int 13<br>cha 08<br><br>naked ac 18 while raging 16<br>w/mundane plate and tower shield ac 28<br>w/mundane plate and tower shield and raging ac 26<br>w/mundane plate and bow ac 25<br>w/mundane plate and bow and raging ac 23<br><br>hp 442 raging 562 (not maxed unsure what it would be)<br><br>for 26 raging 29<br>ref 20 raging 20<br>wil 16 raging 19<br><br>bab:29<br>ab unarmed: 37/32/27/22<br>ab unarmed raging: 40/35/30/25<br>ab W/ mundane L.B.: 41/36/31/26 (doesn't change in rage)<br>ab raging w/ mundane B.A.: 40/35/30/25<br><br>Quick Pros:<br>Overhelming criticals at range and melee.<br>Thundering rage<br><br>Quick Cons:<br>Low reflex and will saves.<br>  <br>01 (b1)  *Armor Proficiency:Heavy*<br>02 (b2)<br>03 (b3)  *PointBlankShot*<br>04 (b4)  S+1 <br>05 (b5)<br>06 (b6)  *Weapon Focus:Long Bow*<br>07 (s1)  Familiar:(builder preferance doesn't matter) <br>08 (a1)  S+1 <br>09 (a2)  *Rapid Shot*<br>10 (a3)<br>11 (b7)<br>12 (b8)  S+1 *Blind Fight*<br>13 (b9)<br>14 (b10)<br>15 (a4)  *Power Attack*<br>16 (a5)  S+1 <br>17 (b11)<br>18 (b12)  *Cleave*<br>19 (b13)<br>20 (b14)  S+1 <br>21 (a6)  *ImpCrit:Long Bow*<br>22 (a7)<br>23 (a8)<br>24 (b15)  S+1 *Terrifying Rage*<br>25 (a9)<br>26 (a10)<br>27 (b16)  *Great Cleave*<br>28 (b17)  S+1 <br>29 (b18)<br>30 (b19)  *ImpCrit: Battle Axe*<br>31 (a11)<br>32 (a12)  S+1 <br>33 (b20)  *OverCrit: Battle Axe*<br>34 (a13)<br>35 (a14)  #OverCrit: Long Bow#<br>36 (b21)  S+1 *Thundering Rage*<br>37 (a15)<br>38 (a16)<br>39 (a17)  *Armor Skin*  <br>40 (a18)  D+1 #Epic Prowess# <br> <br><br>skills<br>01 (b1)  di,in +4 <br>02 (b2)  di,in +1<br>03 (b3)  di,in +1<br>04 (b4)  di,in +1<br>05 (b5)  di,in +1<br>06 (b6)  di,in +1<br>07 (s1)  co +10 tu +5 <br>08 (a1)  hi,li +5<br>09 (a2)  hi,li +5 <br>10 (a3)  -------- <br>11 (b7)  di,in +1 <br>12 (b8)  di,in +5 <br>13 (b9)  di,in +1 <br>14 (b10) di,in +1  <br>15 (a4)  -------- <br>16 (a5)  sp +10<br>17 (b11) tu +5 di,in +2 <br>18 (b12) di,in +2 <br>19 (b13) di,in +1 <br>20 (b14) di,in +1 <br>21 (a6)  ms +10 <br>22 (a7)  -------- <br>23 (a8)  -------- <br>24 (b15) di,in +4 <br>25 (a9)  hi,li +5 <br>26 (a10) -------- <br>27 (b16) tu +5 in +3 di +1 <br>28 (b17) di +3 in +1 <br>29 (b18) di,in +1 <br>30 (b19) di,in +1 <br>31 (a11) hi,li +5 <br>32 (a12) --------  <br>33 (b20) di,in +3 <br>34 (a13) ms,sp +5 <br>35 (a14) -------- <br>36 (b21) di,in +3 <br>37 (a15) tu +5 <br>38 (a16) ms +5<br>39 (a17) sp +5<br>40 (a18) li,sp +2 he +1<br><br>Total Skill Placement<br>213 points<br>concentration(co) +10 (13)<br>discipline(di)    +39 (46)<br>heal(he)          +1  (0) <br>hide(hi)          +20 (22)<br>intimidate(in)    +39 (38)<br>listen(li)        +22 (22)<br>move silently(ms) +20 (22)<br>spot(sp)          +22 (22)<br>tumble(tu)        +20 (22)<br>*note Hide and listen can be taken to 40 instead of using move silently and spot.<br>_________________<br>Spirit, It is the hero's strength, the mother's resilience, and the poor man's armor.

Unfortunately, Overwhelming Critical and Massive Crits (including the bonus from thundering) do not stack.

I've tested it, they do indeed stack.  I think the problem is that Devastating Critical has an issue with Thundering Rage's OnHit in that I think Dev Crit overrides it. (Similar to the issues Enserric gives you if you try to use one of his weapons + dev crit).  You will note if you turn combat debugging on, that Overwealming critical is included in base weapon damage, whereas Massive Critical effects are a seperate beats.<br><br>Now, then...  Why so much barbarian?  I feel like Arcane Arche would give you so very much more.  Barbrian 16/Sorceror 1/AA 23 would seem a more reasonable split.  You lose 1/- DR and 1 use per day of rage (plus 20 HP, I suppose) for +3 Attack/Damage with a bow and a bonus feat.  It seems like a good trade off, unless there's something I am missing.

The only pre-reqs for Thundering rage are 15 levels in Barbarian (Greater Rage), being an epic character, and 25 STR.  You do not have to be and epic barbarian to qualify.  This is similar to how Terrifying Rage works.

To make the build more uber, look at not taking pre epic feats in epic slots... that way you can get some useful feats for the build.

This build has very low  ac so ap:heavy needs to stay. almost all the rest are pre-req feats except rapid shot and blind fight. Then between those 2 I wouldn't drop rapid shot as any decent archer should have it, so  that leaves blind fight which can be dropped.

<b>Very quick</b> rebuild and test, changed the lvl split as I didn't need so many barb lvl's for thundering rage <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  , also dropped blind fight for an extra epic feat slot. Didn't increase charisma so still no spells. Changed the melee weapon from battle axe to long sword, but that's a builder preferance that can be changed (simple or martial). Messed with the skills a little, no hide or move silently as I didn't think it fit with a barbarian in full plate running around (still just a builder preferance though).
