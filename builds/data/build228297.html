It was really a shame. Sir Roald had seemed such a promising young knight. His father had assured the council that he had crushed the boy's desire to sing, and aside from the occasional song and dance on the Round Table after a bit too much mead, the boy from the swamp castle had behaved well enough. <br><br>But then something seemed to just snap in him. He started singing, juggling, and generally behaving in a way that was just unseemly for a knight. I mean, really, how could you have a proper duel with someone who insists on <i>tumbling</i> around in full armor?!? Sure, it makes him harder to hit, but it looks so undignified. And the singing - how could you possible concentrate on the fight with that awful caterwauling? It just wasn't right.<br><br>The latest tournament was the final straw. Knights were used to insulting each other before a battle, but there were rules to this sort of thing. Insulting someone's mother, father, horse, or wife was traditional, but Roald's insults were just infuriating. Nobody even knew what "Nee!" meant, anyway.....<br>-------------<br><br>Just having fun with this one. Anyone want to roleplay a knight from The Holy Grail? <i>This build requires an alignment change from Lawful Good to any chaotic alignment at level 24.</i> Easy enough to do in most modules, just start bashing down doors. You end up with a major buffer - all Paladin spells, all Bard spells, level 16 Bard song, Divine Might and Divine Shield. <br><br>Now, anyone have a way to replace the normal bard song music with "Brave, Brave, Brave Sir Robin"? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br><br>Paladin(20), Bard(16), Champion of Torm(4), Human<br><b>Playable 1-40, PvM</b><br>STR: 14<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 10<br>CHA: 16 (30)<br><br>Hitpoints: 456<br>Skillpoints: 161<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 36/30/27<br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 36 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 17/28<br><br>Discipline 43(45), Perform 20(30), Taunt 43(53), Tumble 40(39), UMD 15(25)<br><br>L01: P(1): Weapon Focus: Longsword, Power Attack, P: (Divine Health, Lay on Hands)<br>L02: P(2): P: (Aura of Courage, Smite Evil)<br>L03: P(3): Divine Might, P: (Turn Undead)<br>L04: P(4): CHA+1, (CHA=17)<br>L05: P(5)<br>L06: P(6): Divine Shield<br>L07: P(7)<br>L08: P(8): CHA+1, (CHA=18)<br>L09: P(9): Extra Smiting<br>L10: P(10)<br>L11: P(11)<br>L12: P(12): CHA+1, Improved Critical: Longsword, (CHA=19)<br>L13: P(13)<br>L14: P(14)<br>L15: P(15): Blind Fight<br>L16: P(16): CHA+1, (CHA=20)<br>L17: P(17)<br>L18: P(18): Toughness<br>L19: P(19)<br>L20: P(20): CHA+1, (CHA=21)<br>L21: CT(1): Great Charisma I, (CHA=22)<br>L22: CT(2): Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword, CT: (Sacred Defense)<br>L23: CT(3)<br>L24: CT(4): CHA+1, Great Charisma II, Epic Prowess, (CHA=24)<br>L25: Ba(1): Ba: (Bard Song, Bardic Knowledge)<br>L26: Ba(2)<br>L27: Ba(3): Curse Song<br>L28: Ba(4): CHA+1, (CHA=25)<br>L29: Ba(5)<br>L30: Ba(6): Lingering Song<br>L31: Ba(7)<br>L32: Ba(8): CHA+1, (CHA=26)<br>L33: Ba(9): Extend Spell<br>L34: Ba(10)<br>L35: Ba(11)<br>L36: Ba(12): CHA+1, Great Charisma III, (CHA=28)<br>L37: Ba(13)<br>L38: Ba(14)<br>L39: Ba(15): Great Charisma IV, (CHA=29)<br>L40: Ba(16): CHA+1, (CHA=30)<br><br><br>You could pop in an ESF: Taunt instead of Extend Spell or Lingering Song if you want, or drop both for 2 more Cha.

i love you! this looks a solid build, but i might be wanting to drop 5 PAL for 4 more CoT (+2 feats) and 1 bard. this would make the build more versatile, and means you could grab a couple of secondary feats for the build.<br>_________________<br>Dwarves hate to be mistaken for Gnomes.

I like the level 4 spells, going down to 15 paladin levels only leaves you 1 per day unless you find some Wis boosting gear. And the 17th bard level doesn't gain much on the song, so I presume you want it for the extra spells? I don't think it's worth it since the high Cha already gives you a lot of bonus Bard spells, and since it is the prime stat you will make cha-boosting gear a priority (mmmmm, nymph cloaks....). <br><br>So dropping to 15 paladin will take level 4 spells from 3 per day to 1 per day, and 17 bard will raise level 6 spells from 2 per day to 3 per day. I think the paladin spells are more useful (Holy Sword primarily, since it gives such a nice boost to any weapon). But you could certainly do it either way.<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 01/26/06 00:58</span></i></p>

with those 4 CoT levels, if you took 2 more grt Wisdoms, you would gain another naked casting of a level 4 pally spell, IIRC<br>_________________<br>Dwarves hate to be mistaken for Gnomes.

wow i like the looks of this build. it is very similar to some of the things i have toyed with in my head for a pally build. but can someone tell me how good you could get the ab with all the buffs this build has available and maybe at least a bit of exactly what buffs. <br><br>thanks,<br>Drake Drakonias<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.helpwinmybet.com/" target="_blank">http://www.helpwinmybet.com/</a>

Divine Favor: +5 AB, +5 damage<br>Bless: +1 AB<br>Aid: +1 AB<br>Prayer: +1 to AB and damage<br>Greater Magic Weapon or Holy Sword: +5 AB and Damage (only if actual weapon mundane, otherwise it raises it to +5 if it was less than +5).<br>Taunt: -6 to enemy AC<br>Bard Song: +2 to AB, +3 to damage, +5 to AC<br>Curse Song: -2 to enemy AB, -3 to enemy damage, -5 to enemy AC<br>War Cry: +2 AB and +2 damage<br><br>Totals: +17 to AB and -11 to enemy AC, for a net of +28 (plus his base AB of 36 means effective AB of 64). He also picks up +16 damage per hit (+11 if his weapon is already +5 or more), and +7 to his AC. If he uses Divine Might and Divine Shield, he adds his Cha bonus to AC and damage. Against evil opponents, he can Smite to add his Cha bonus to AB as well. Since he has UMD, he could cast some Cleric or Wizard buffs from scrolls as well, but I am not counting that. I am also not counting ability buffs, but he can cast Bull's Str, Cat's Grace, Aura of Glory, Eagle's Splendor, etc. If you catch him unaware and unbuffed he could be in trouble, but fully buffed he is a force to be reckoned with.<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 02/02/06 21:51</span></i></p>
