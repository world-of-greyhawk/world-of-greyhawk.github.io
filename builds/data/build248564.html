Oh yeah, thanks for the name Okembour, my mind was blank.<br><br>I made this build in an attempt to make a poweful Cleric / Dwarven Defender for low magical environments, as both classes do greatly on low magical environments; since I needed 17 Cleric levels to get pre-epic BAB of 15 and use Divine Power's Exploit, I had little space for Fighter (or other) and thus it also uses the Club Exploit. The Strength ended quite low after all, but he's a tank plus Cleric buffs.<br><br>Playable Levels: 1-40<br>PvM and PvP<br><br>Alignment: Any lawful<br><br>Dwarf<br><br>Abilities:<br>STR 14 (20)<br>DEX 14<br>CON 17 (22)<br>WIS 16 (19)<br>INT 8<br>CHA 6<br><br>1 Cleric1 - Blind-Fight, Domains: Trickery and Travel<br>2 Cleric2<br>3 Cleric3 - Weapon Focus: Club<br>4 Cleric4 - WIS +1 (17)<br>5 Cleric5<br>6 Cleric6 - Extend Spell<br>7 Cleric7<br>8 Cleric8 - WIS +1 (18)<br>9 Cleric9 - Knockdown<br>10 Cleric10<br>11 Cleric11<br>12 Cleric12 - WIS +1 (19), Toughness<br>13 Cleric13<br>14 Cleric14<br>15 Cleric15 - Dodge<br>16 Cleric16 - CON +1 (18)<br>17 Cleric17<br>18 Dwarven Defender1 - Improved Critical: Club<br>19 Dwarven Defender2<br>20 Dwarven Defender3 - CON +1 (19)<br>21 Dwarven Defender4 - Epic Weapon Focus: Club<br>22 Dwarven Defender5<br>23 Dwarven Defender6<br>24 Fighter1 - CON +1 (20) Weapon Specialization: Club, Epic Weapon Specialization: Club<br>25 Dwarven Defender7<br>26 Dwarven Defender8<br>27 Dwarven Defender9 - Great Strength I (15)<br>28 Dwarven Defender10 - CON +1 (21)<br>29 Dwarven Defender11<br>30 Dwarven Defender12 - Epic Damage Reduction I<br>31 Dwarven Defender13<br>32 Dwarven Defender14 - STR +1 (16) Epic Damage Reduction II<br>33 Dwarven Defender15 - Great Strength II (17)<br>34 Dwarven Defender16<br>35 Dwarven Defender17<br>36 Dwarven Defender18 - STR +1 (18), Great Strength III (19), Epic Damage Reduction III<br>37 Dwarven Defender19<br>38 Dwarven Defender20<br>39 Dwarven Defender21 - Great Strength IV (20)<br>40 Dwarven Defender22 - CON +1 (22), Epic Prowess<br><br>As always, Travel Domain should be changed if there are perm-haste items, if there are, War might be the best choice.<br><br>Skills:<br>Tumble: 20<br><br>He has a terrible amount of skillpoints, only enough for one full skill, so I decided go defensive with Tumble, since my STR is low for Discipline checks anyway.<br><br>Saving Throws:<br>Fortitude: 29 (+2 while in Defensive Stance)<br>Reflex: 18 (+2 while in Defensive Stance)<br>Will: 27 (+2 while in Defensive Stance)<br><br>HP: 690<br>AC: 16 (10 Base +2 DEX +4 Tumble)<br>BAB: 25<br>AB with normal club: +34/+29/+24<br>Damage: 1d6+11 (12-17) Critical 19-20/X2<br>Damage Reduction: 24/-<br><br><b>AC Enhancements:</b><br>Full Plate: +7 (+8 -1 DEX)<br>Tower Shield: +3<br>Shield of Faith: +4 (Deflection)<br>Magic Vestment: +10 (Armor &amp; Shield)<br>Haste +4 (Dodge)<br>Undeath's Eternal Foe +4 (Dodge)<br>Defensive Stance +4 (Dodge)<br>Buffed AC: 48<br>Battletide: +2 (enemy receives -2 AB)<br>Effective buffed AC: <i>50</i><br><br><b>AB Enhancements</b><br>+3 Strength (Bull's Strength and Defensive Stance)<br>+5 Divine Favor<br>+5 Divine Power<br>+5 Greater Magic Weapon<br>+2 Battletide<br>+1 Bless<br>+1 Aid<br>+1 Prayer<br>Buffed AB: +57<br>+Haste: <i>+57/+52/+47/+57/+57</i><br><br><b>Damage Enhancements:</b><br>+5 Divine Favor<br>+5 Greater Magical Weapon<br>+9-14 Darkfire<br>+3 Strength (Bull's Strength and Defensive Stance)<br>Damage: <i>34-44</i><br><br><b>HP Enhancements:</b><br>+80 HP Defensive Stance<br>+80 HP Endurance<br>+17 HP Divine Power<br>Buffed HP: <i>867</i><br><br><b>Body Enhancements:</b><br>Haste<br>Undeath's Eternal Foe<br>Freedom of Movement<br>Improved Invisibility<br>True Seeing<br>Spell Resistance (29)<br>Regenerate<br>Protection from Elements<br><br><b>Pros:</b><br>High DR<br>High HP<br>Good buffed AC<br>Good buffed AB<br>Good buffed damage<br><br><b>Cons:</b><br>Close to no skills<br>Low Reflex save<br>Low unbuffed AC<br>Low unbuffed AB<br>Low unbuffed damage<br>-Basically reliance on dispellable buffs

Instead of Tumble, try Concentration? Maybe then you'll actually make a few checks in battle if you need to do some healing(Which is doubtful). Intresting build, though.

Could work, actually I forgot he had healing, but yes, that's a good option for more resistance in battle, hardly needed IMO.<br><br>Thanks for the input.

For this particular build I would leave the Strength at 14 and raise wisdom or consititution instead.  Divine Power alone will raise your strength to 18.  Since you are unlikely to get items to reach +12 in low magic, this shouldn't pose a problem for the build.  Nothing really to add besides that, well done.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 08/02/06 02:32</span></i></p>

It's not a bad option for higher overall stats Mith, but to be honest, I don't like the STR boost from Divine Power, it's crap, since Divine Power has a short duration, I will normally make all my long-term buffs fight after resting (like Bull's Strength) and leave some short term for when I sight an enemy or so, (i.e. I've been using Divine Favor as if it was a Combat Mode).<br>What happens is that if my STR is 14 and I use Bull's Strength it can get to 16-19, if I have 18 or 19 STR Divine Power will no longer do anything for STR, even if it's a buffed value, it only works if you cast Divine Power first, and since the durations simply cannot be compared it is most likely that will not happen.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;I love it Thax.

No. Yes.  NO!  Yes, you need 4 ftr lvls for ws for ALMOST all weapons, but if you had read the above, you would notice that we talk about EXPLOITS.  Club only requires one lvl of fighter to get ws.  iirc it still does, but it most certainly did when this build was originally done.<br><br>Peace<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Well, I don't know if it still works on the new version, but the exploit was that you can take WS and EWS on club with a single Fighter level if you had Improved Critical beforehand, I did tested the build back when I made it.<br><br>I'm not sure if it still works on the newest version, and truth be told I don't have NWN installed right now to check, just installed Ubuntu recently and I haven't even tried to get NWN working, I'll check later how to get it running on linux... perhaps.
