Sitting high on his throne the Master was alone in his decadance...evil to the core he ruled the region with tyranny..many a young even epic adventurer had fallen afoul of his mighty scythe...not necessarily the most pratical of weapons but he did not care...nor did he care to clean up after those hapless adventurers as piles of bodies lay rotting around him...<br><br>From across the room he heard a sound...someone was coming up the stairs...judging by the timing he was alone..."hmm another to the slaughter" thought the Master...Slowly the door crept open a standing infront of him was a particularly unremarkable looking fellow...<br><br>"So you are the Master?" spoke the Unknown Warrior<br><br>"Ha" growled the Master, slowly standing to reveal his towering height "many have fallen before me and you think you can beat me alone?"<br><br>The Unknown Warrior was not phased, "you do not fighten me..."<br><br>The Master's eye's grew wide as the unknown warrior held aloft a severed head...stammering..."that...that...you will pay for this..."<br><br>"Funny" retorted the Unknown Warrior "that is precisely what your Tax Collector said..."<br><br>Unfurling his wings the Master grabbed at his scythe and launched himself across the room, the keen edge striking true as he swung at the Unknown Warrior.<br><br>"Is that the best you can do?" he Taunted, scythe blade stuck deep in his left shoulder.<br><br>As the Master pulled his scythe back it caught on part of the burnt plate pulling back revealing just a glimpse of the boney arm below, lifeless but still deathless...maybe it is the Master who will now be mastered...<br><br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">  <br><br>This build is for all those who are tired of those pesky 700+ crits getting you down.

First of all, you mention things happening on your server and specifies them. That's fine. You mention Discipline, which is easily implemented. I agree, AB is a bit low, but you gain hp's and DR as a trade. Take more PM in the epic's to raise AB, or just increase str more after 22 CON.<br>But I don't think this is a dependant upon specific items, with a few small twists it is good to go in most settings. Lower starting CON by 2, or 1 CON and 1 STR would gain you 6 ability increases. Not a bad trade IMO.<br><br>Short and high octane story. Good, hard to kill build.<br><br>edit: I would have used epic toughness for something else.

Maybe drop some fighter and take more Bard... maybe 8 in total? that would gain you a further +1 AB with the effects of song. You could possibly squeeze in Curse Song and Lingering Song as well. <br><br>Just thoughts at the moment.. haven't tried it.<br><br>Great Cleave? don't need this if you are not going for OC or DC.

But half-orcs will get you an exp penalty <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  Using dwarf will allow you to get 18 CON easier and have some left over for raising other stats to get more skillpoints and get spellcraft up (surely, that's helpful?).<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

Sure, dwarf is a better powergaming race for several reasons, but how could you not love an undead half orc with 9 dex, 6 int, 8 wis, and 6 cha?  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Change him from fighter to barbarian and rename him the Ghost of Captain Caveman!<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Lol yeah, the half-orc would be a pretty mad build, though i may not be too concerned with an XP penalty as you are gonna reach lvl 40 at some point....going Barbarian would give some extra damage reduction but lose out a bit on some feats...though there are certainly some pre-epic feats that aren't really crucial *coughs Great Cleave*<br><br>Dwarf would be a better powergaming option...&amp; I do have a Dwarf version however, I rebuilt it around human as there was a few race restricted items I wanted to use!!!<br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!

I had started the Dwarf with 16 STR, 12 DEX, 18 CON and 14 INT. Starting with fighter (and losing 16 skillpoints because you can't start as bard because of stupid noobie-proofing), you'll get 180 skillpoints with your level allocation. You could take UMD to 42(40), spellcraft to 43(45), Tumble 40, some in perform and have enough to max discipline with a few points left over (you could take heal on your server if you wished, or taunt). I'd say it's nicer to start as a dwarf for this build of yours <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

Perfect health is pretty useless at the level you get it, IMO. I'll post this more generalized version (hope you don't mind), not specialized for your server.
