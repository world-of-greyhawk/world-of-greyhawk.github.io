A few reasons for the choices I made above:<br><br>1)I took Monk pre 20 for a boost in saves namely +1 Fort/Will and +2 Reflex.  You lose 1 AB but is more inline with my build concept.<br><br>2)I passed on Imp Crit, Blind Fight, etc. for more meta magic feats.  I skipped out on spell focus because the really good spells have no save at all.  He is designed for a PW where SR can be 40+ on players and monsters so Spell Penetration was a must.<br><br>3)Hellball is there for fun.  Nothing like seeing a huge dragon spit one of those out.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      Can be replaced if you so choose.<br><br>4)SD seemed to benefit both characters here.  HiPS when casting spells and running away.  Uncanny Dodge for the large Dex bonus you get in Dragon Shape.  Not to mention a nice boost to your Hide/MS skills as well.<br><br>5)With 36 caster levels, his buffs will last a long time and be very difficult to dispel by all but the most dedicated of mages.  This in and of itself boosts the defensive capability of the Dragon Shape.  Not to mention a SR of 48 which is pretty darn good.<br><br>Comments welcome.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/" target="_blank">http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Talamier on 03/06/06 23:39</span></i></p>
