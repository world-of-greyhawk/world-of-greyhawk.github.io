Mostly I picked elf because the guild I am in within the PW is elven... I was half-elf so which didnt work out well so I went 100% elf. I understand now about the stats. I haven't started in-game as I am only using the mod to test it. The guild is low on clerics and I wanted to add more cleric than monk but one that can kick some butt. I am looking at the Battle Priestess and considering the input there. I was going for 12 monk for Diamond Soul. My orginal thought was 12monk /24cleric /4fighter. <br><br>The diety gives me a choice of +2 to any stat plus a progression of adding AB or AC with bonuses that I mentioned. So I am trying to take that into account.<br><br>Thanks for your input..and any other words of wisdom as I am a total newb with this but am also totally addicted to it too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> <br><br>Weri<br>_________________<br>Be the change you want to see in the world ---Ghandi

One thought to ponder about is instead of using kamas and having a so-so ab, you could leave your dex low and pump up your wis, drop all the kama, dual-wielding feats and pick up a Longbow using the Zen Archery feat instead - you will have a better ab with a bow in this case than using kamas with weap finesse.<br>Get Weap focus/specialization in Longbow.<br>This will give you more spell slots, and your ac will not change as you are a monk. Further if my belief is right, ac from Wis bonus is not compromised when being flat-footed. Only trade off will be that your Reflex saves will be lower.

Also I love either fighting unarmed (love the kicks to the head) or with kamas with darkfire and that extra attack.<br><br>Ok off to test the next 2 ideas. Thanks... anymore thoughts are welcome but I am going to submit/start this build in-world this evening.
