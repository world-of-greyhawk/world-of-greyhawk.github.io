Hi all,<br><br>    This is a build I've been working on / playing with. I was looking at creating a witch doctor or barbarian shaman type character. I basically went druid barb for the build and just added the monk at level 40 to add wisdom bonus + tumble etc. You could easily just go barb for level 40 and max disc.<br>Stats:<br><br>Human<br><br>naked AC = 20<br><br>begin stats   final stats  <br>S   15        /       20                  <br>D   14        /       14<br>Con 14        /       14                   <br>I   10        /       10<br>W   15        /       20<br>Cha  8        /        8<br><br>I built it going level 1 druid and alternated barb and druid until 15. <br>Then 16 - 20 barb, 21 druid, 22 - 24 barb, 25 - 32 druid,<br>33 barb, 34 - 39 druid, and 40 monk.<br><br>I got greater rage and terrifying rage (lvl 24,= barb 16) along with dmg reduction 2. I got an epic spell on druid lvl 21 which was character level 39 I believe.<br><br>This character has a good melee ability especially when in elemental shape and raging strength = 40 and con = 28,and around 800 hp. Also has some pretty good spell power with maximized ice storms, harm, finger of death, storm of vengeance etc.<br><br>I'm sure some level tweaking could make it better. Please any help or comments are most welcome.<br><br> I chose feats as, in no particular order ,alertness, power atk, cleave, great cleave, combat casting,ext spell, max spell, hellball, imp combat casting, knockdown, luck of heroes, toughness, terrifying rage, wf great axe,and zen archery. <br><br><br>                   Thanks , Mano<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick.

It would be interesting if you posted the ab of the character.  The reason i say that is because i hear that druids gain ab 3/2 and barbs, like fighters gain ab 1/1 levels.   What i am getting at is, you stagger your lvls, d/b/d/b/d/b.etc.   I am not sure how this would affect the lv 20 ab for the character, if any.  <br><br>Here's to hopin a more knowledgable one than i sees this to correct my faulty logic<br><br>Peace

The order in which you take your pre-epic levels doesn't matter.  Druids may get 3/4 AB every level, but that gets rounded down immediately...it doesn't carry over to the next level in any way.  For example, clerics also get 3/4 AB per level.  If those fractions carried over, then you'd expect a cleric(1)/druid(1) character to have a BAB of 1 and 1/2, which would round down to 1.  But it doesn't work that way.  One level of druid gives you 3/4 AB, rounded down to 0.  One level of cleric gives you 3/4 AB, rounded down to 0.  So a cleric(1)/druid(1) has a BAB of 0 + 0 = 0.  <br><br>Long story short, all that matters is the actual number of levels you take in each class by level 20.  This build takes 8 druid and 12 barbarian levels pre-epic, giving it a BAB of 18 at level 20.<br><br>I like the mix of the high level barbarian rages with the druid's various shapes.  One thing to note though is that, due to your low wisdom, you'll probably have to stick to spells without saving throws.  Finger of Death for example will not be very useful, as even a pure level 40 mage would have a very good shot at making that fortitude saving throw.  You're also unlikely to get the stun effect on Storm of Vengeance to hit all that often.  But, it seems to be more of a melee build anyway.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 04/12/05 08:41</span></i></p>

My thing with this build is that perhaps...<br><br>Druid 18/barb 21/monk 1 seems to be better with terrifying rage and dragonshape as your focus.  Through buffs, you can obtain some extremely high AC, not to mention, you have a true dragonfear aura this way.<br><br>20 str is pretty piddly as a meleer, and you would gain much more wisdom needed for dragonshape if you went all out.<br><br>You lose a 2d6 cold in ice damage, and a little duration in spells, and a few spell slots, but these are once again made up by 30 wisdom needed for the shape i feel.<br><br>Anyway, those are my thoughts on it, gaining 19 or 20 base attack pre-epic and using monk attacks is nice.<br>_________________<br>I may not be able to get an erection, but at least I have enough balls not to hack.

Aye, its possible although, I doubt that its very playable to have a raging dragon with barbarian 20+ Druid 14+ and monk 1+, focusing on wisdom as a primary stat.<br><br>I think that a very rough version of this that Ive made had BAB of 16 at lv 20 and could get a str of 60 ish in dragon form by using empowered bulls str and the barbarian rage.  The fear aura was nice to have as well, hitpoints came in at around 1000 or so with rage running, and the AC was a respectable 60ish with no equipment or items merged and the rage AC penalty having its effect.

Hi everyone,<br><br>     Thanks for the ideas. As I said I was playing around with the idea of the character and trying to get a balanced playable character. I know this combination isn't the most powerful. I didn't go for dragon shape because of the wisdom needing to be so high and you end up with the other stats sucking. Although being a raging dragon does sound like fun. What about using the shapechange spell to shapechange to dragon? What's the difference between the two dragons? The one being a shift ability and the other a shapechange from the spell.<br><br>    I'd thought about instead of going dragon to go for the barb rage feats, but their stat requirements are pretty crazy. I guess a bard, barb, rdd could get the strength and con needed for the rage feats fairly easy and still have other stats not to gimped.<br><br><br>   M1ke47, could you post some build details on your build you mention. I'd like to see the basics of it starting stats etc.<br><br>                            Thanks, ManO<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick.

It's very hard to comment n the build if you don't list some type of level advancement and where you take feats. Also how do you deal with the alignment change? Barbarian to monk is a pretty big alignment change for one level of a class.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

I'll post a rough and by no means perfect build shortly.  when I built this however i did just use a 100 points to lawful align change at level 40 just so I could get the monk level, so i guess unless you have this option avaliable on your server its not really possible or playable really.  Having said that i will get the details written down shortly.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "190312", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Raging Dragon /Barbarian 20/Druid 17/Monk 3</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 04/14/05 00:14</span></i></p>
