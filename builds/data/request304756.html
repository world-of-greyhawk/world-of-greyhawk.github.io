It's illegal, in version 1.69 you need 18 Druid levels for dragon shape instead of 14. That would change the spread to Druid 18 / Monk 1 / Assassin 21. I could make a third version of the build to make up with version 1.69 and make it definite, maybe I should, heck I've thought about it, but I just haven't had the inspiration... if you're so eager for it, it might just appear... soon.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/27/08 19:48</span></i></p>
