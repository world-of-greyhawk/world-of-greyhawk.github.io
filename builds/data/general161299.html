I noticed that sorcerers don't get any more spells after lvl 20. Sure you can remove a spell and then pick another but you are still limited on the amount of spells you can know for a certain spell lvl. So basically you can only have 3 lvl 9 spells.<br><br>Is it just me or does this seem totally wrong. Did I do something horribly wrong when I was test building a sorcerer?

I'm not very knowledgable in the field of spells, but I think that no class gets extra spells past lvl 20, be it arcane or divine.

No that is correct, Sorc's only have 3 level 9 spells (the NWN manual has a table near the back with number of "Spells Known")<br><br>If you want more than 3 level 9 spells then look into being a Wizard instead, they can have more...

Wizard can end up with all spells in the game and be able to use them (if prepared) before lvl18.  Doesn't mean its best; just more versatile.<br>Sorc gets the best play of the field until lvl20.  I'd suggest going RDD from there as you get major CHA and STR bonus; and ac to boot with some nice immunities.

And take the Spell Focus feats as these artificially raise your Caster level (when determining if they punch throught the target's saves and spell resistance).
