Of course, one could always just make a Cleric/Rogue 21/19split and avoid the penalty, but playability is sacrificed as one waits for Cleric spells to advance.  In this case, playability was established first and foremost as a prioity, and everything falls into place after that.  This isn't a build that <i>waits</i> to mature, or holds it breath for a signature feat.  For those who don't mind XP penalties, by all means, go Rogue, and just restructure a little here and there.<br><br>Also, due to the lack of representation of these stupid oafs, I thought it refreshing to have another more RP-centric build to share that can still kick some booty in PvM play.<br><br><i>No Elves were harmed in the making of this character (except for about 9).</i><br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/14/07 13:48</span></i></p>

Uhmmm... call me thick if you must, but why have you listed "evil alignment" as a disadvantage? Is it because your vulnereable to "smite evil", or do you just prefer being good/neutral?

An interesting build Grizz, and well done. I must confess to some surprise at the lack of a story for this one, as it would seem replete with possibility for a good yarn.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...

It's just that Evil can be a bit hard to rp in worlds and mods that are geared for the good/neutral-centric player.  Of course, good mods and PWs provide alternate paths other than good (something the OCs failed to do).  Being evil and a Gruumsh worshipper can also affect other players, who may frown on you with distaste, mistrust, or even fear.  Don't expect any Paladins to invite you into their party.  <br><br>In some PW cultures, Blackguards can typically slide by such taboo because they at least don't look like a monster, and are often (but not always) still upholders of some semblance of law and order.  At the very least they can deceive people that they are good.  Assassins can get away with it because they can just disappear, or also "pretend" to be a Rogue, Wizard, etc...  but a large, half-orc with bloodshot eyes, foaming at the mouth, and the One-Eyed symbol of Gruumsh painted all across his armor is a bit harder to explain.  He is an agent for Chaos and Slaughter, and he should be represented as such.  At the very least I would play him like a blood-thirsty Klingon who is just waiting for someone to look at him funny so he can wreak carnage on those about him, and then bathe in blood and slap high-fives to any of his companions that are still alive and didn't get "accidentally" brained.<br><br>It was my idea that this would be a fun bad guy to play, plus I found that there really aren't that many Half-orc templates around unless they are just heavy, thumper-Barbs or "Highest Str AB Imaginable".  There are plenty of Clerics to Moradin, Clangeddin, Torm, Tyr, Corellon, Cyric, Avoreen, blah, blah, blah, but there were few if any dedicated to Gruumsh.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I can honestly say this is the best half-orc build I've seen in the guild.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
