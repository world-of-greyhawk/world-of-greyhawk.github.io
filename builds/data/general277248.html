Living on a high magic world and have a few griefers.  They have always left me alone but last night I experienced a doozy.<br><br>What is the sneaker killer of choice?  The particular one is a heavy monk  Monk/Assassin with a level of SD cheese sprinkled on top.<br><br>I prefer non-casters but will try whatever.<br><br>Thanks

Something that can spot the person and then knock him down.

Monk/Sor/PM<br><br>PM for sneak damage immunity, Monk for speed and punch power.  Sor can be replaced with Wiz of course, but I'd try to take it up to hte point where you can get True Sight.<br><br>====<br><br>Another combo would be Druid/Monk/Assasin<br><br>Heavy on the Druid side to get Elder Elemental Shape, 9 monk to get Improved Evasion, and the rest Assasin.  Cast an extended True Seeing along with other buffs, hop into Elder Water Air form with Weapon Finness, and sneak attack the sneakers.  You are crit and sneak immune.  And will land many hits with your built in 34 dex.  Take Wolf companion since they have a nice fear howl.  The assasin improved invis can be used when shifted.<br><br>===<br><br>Druid/Shifter/Monk Undead shape.<br><br>Truesight yourself, then chase the little bugger with your Scythe!  Heavy on the Monk side for more speed.  Only 10 shifter levels needed.  Or you could go Vampire Monk and drain him.

Maybe Bard 20/PM 10/RDD 10, Elf; they won't be sneak attacking you that's for sure. Bard Song will augment your Spot and Listen, while Curse Song will lower your opponent's skills (inc. Discipline <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  ).<br><br>But if True Sight is also unnerfed then any build with True Sight is probably good enough. They will still mess up your attacks per round with HiPS but at least you can just attack them again.<br>_________________<br>" -- They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then it's night once more."<br><br> - Pozzo in Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett

I second Bard. Assuming the sneaker is dex-based, the Bard can spam Balgarn's Iron Horn and knock them down. You don't even need the PM levels, although they won't hurt. <br><br>That, or any build with True Sight. Dragon Shape builds work well also. <br><br>TM
