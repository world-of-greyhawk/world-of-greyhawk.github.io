The idea is to remove your armor and shield and buff when necessary between fights.  However, spells such as Displacement and War Cry can be cast with armor on, which is a nice bonus.  You just have to step out of combat to cast them.  If you have access to knockdown immunity, I would probably max concentration instead.<br><br>My goal was to develop a character with strong bard levels throughout the leveling process for a better song.  I did not want or need to get RDD 10 as soon as possible.  I feel there is a nice balance between RDD stats, spells avaialable from cha, and bard song.<br><br>Epic Reflexes is sort of a bonus feat - can be replaced with anything you like really.  I chose it to help round out his saves.<br><br>If you can get 75 perform, you add 1AC to his bard song.<br><br>You may want to go with a Scimitar to take advantage of his innate ability to cast keen edge.  I went with warhammer for extra undead smashing which I like. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/" target="_blank">http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Talamier on 02/16/06 21:51</span></i></p>

If you want, you could drop 6 bard levels in epic for 2 fighter and 4 RDD, or drop 4 bard levels for 4 fighter levels. Same total number of Epic feats, but now you can sub EWS for the Epic Reflexes. You still can take Lasting Inspiration (easier with the 4 fighter levels, but can be done either way), and only lose a few skill points on the song. Taking 6 fighter levels would let you take EWS without dropping anything, but you get LI later.<br><br>TM

On the PW that I play on we asked the question of how many rounds bard song lasts and which is calculated first.<br><br>The Mod operator answered Lingering first then Lasting.<br><br>So its 150 rounds of bard song, not 105.<br><br>I have 2 bards and the one with both songs does last significantly longer.  so unless it was changed for our PW, Bard song 150 rounds

In the original game Lasting Inspiration is calculated first and Lingering only makes it 105.<br>_________________<br>Fanget av begravelsen<br>pines vi av guds godhet<br>ingen flammer, intet hat<br>de hadde rett vi kom til Helvete... <br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.burzum.org" target="_blank">Burzum</a> - Hvis Lyset Tar Oss

either way - do you still need both when you have 20 uses a day? (ie. 20 bard levels for LI)

If you get to start at high level, you can skip LS if you get LI. But if you have to play from level 1, LS does help quite a bit during levelling (15 rounds vs 10 rounds is significant, even though 105 vs 100 is not).<br><br>So for a level 40 PvP server, I would drop LS for something else of your choice. For a RP server where you start at level 1 and will spend a long time building the character up, LS is worth keeping.<br><br>TM
