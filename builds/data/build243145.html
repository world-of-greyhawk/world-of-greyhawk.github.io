Love the concept! Just my 2 cents...<br><br>Would you think about going Human? I see you alternating the early Barb/Druid to avoid XP penalties but if you could take 7 Druid levels early (for Stoneskin and Wildshape) he might be a little more playable early on. Say Barb1/Druid7 by level 8.<br><br>If I had a permanent haste item by level 39, I'd drop Blinding Speed, rearrange a little and get Undead Shape.

Nice concept!  Shifter can be exploited in so many ways still with all its different forms.  Looks like a pretty solid build from what I can see.  I'd only worry about my buff's getting dispelled because of the lowish druid levels and your rage won't last a very long time.  Even so, you get a pretty good AB and the taunt will help a lot.<br><br>Your save bonus from Spellcraft is not +10 (as you calculated), its actually +7.  The bonus only results from ranks taken, not adjusted skill, and you can only get a maximum of +8 (40 divided by 5), as the bonus goes up 1 for every 5 points you put into spellcraft.<br><br>I'm not certain about Blinding speed.  I'm sure its nice, but it seems like kind of a waste, given its only one use per day and lasts only 10 rounds.<br><br>I don't know what the rules are on this forum regarding this, but I'd prefer if you use a standard NWN race.  Duergar should also have an ECL of +2, I believe.  In the future, it would also be nice if you organized your posting a little better.   A lot of the stats you posted are bunched together and difficult to read.<br><br>'Rageing' should be spelled 'raging', by the way. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Ythaniel on 06/07/06 15:54</span></i></p>

You only get wisdom 15 late in the game.  You won't be casting any lvl 5 spells untill that happens.  A lvl 9 Druid "can" get lvl 5 spells if he has the wisdom for it.  Do item buffs make one qualify for spell ranges??

No, only base WIS qualifies you for spell ranges. Gear just grants additional spell slots, buffs not even that (both, of course, improve the DCs).<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?

Nice! Those shifters . . . <br>shape (&amp; dwarf) boosts your stats, saves, and damage quite nicely. Minos seem to be very playable, with all armor etc. merging. Great HPs and, aside from RP and 'coolness,' looks quite playable; great axe, too: cool!

yes i see your problem with the late epic, well im not to good at finding the small things that would put is so that you get epic faster, yes the blinding speed i toke because, i only focus on mino form, so i did´t wanted the undead shape ( kind a borring )and did not know what to take so i though why not give the bull some speed, and perm hast items are as i know not avaliabe on the server i play its low magic server it goes it goes to + 3 magic items wich are like rare items thier. if any have suggestion in how an alternativ lvl guid could feel free to post it.<br><br>thx Robert Tyr for the nice words about my little bull <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  nice picture, and thx for the nice words all <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Imp_lord on 06/08/06 06:38</span></i></p>
