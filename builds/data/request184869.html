Hi all ye folks.<br>I'm trying to figure out a good way to combine cleric/monk/rogue to make up a decent tanking monster that can survive the tough area's and harm the tough bosses on a PW that I play on.  Rogue was a thought since UMD is pretty important there (40 or better being the best suggestion); I was wondering: does anyone have any good suggestions?

Well, if you don't mind the XP penalty, a dual-Kama wielding Halfling Rogue 19/Cleric 15/Monk 6 works pretty well.  If you want more caster levels, you can do as many as 26, the build being Rogue 13/Cleric 26/Monk 1, although of course that last Monk level seems a little cheesy.  <br><br>Personally I tend to take more Rogue levels as I like to get both Epic Dodge and Crippling Strike, but if you're playing on a PW a higher caster level might be nice so that your buffs wouldn't be dispelled.  <br><br>Also note that you don't strictly need to use kamas - you can use a Shortbow instead if you want, but if you do that you won't be able to buff it with Darkfire/Greater Magic Weapon, nor will you get any benefit from Crippling Strike.  <br><br><br>My versions of this build can be found here:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "151185", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Sure, if you do a Human Rogue 13/Monk 12/Cleric 15 you won't get an XP penalty, or if you do the admittedly cheesy Rogue 13/Cleric 26/Monk 1 this will also avoid an XP penalty as long as you take Monk as your last level. <br><br>That said, I would probably take the XP penalty and go with the Halfling build, as I feel that it is stronger overall, even if it does take longer to level up.
