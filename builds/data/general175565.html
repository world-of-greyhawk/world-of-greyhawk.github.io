He'll never be very good, but you can cast greater magic fang, awaken, stoneskin and aura of vitality.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

And also bull's strength.<br>And he will be good - on one low magic RP server I play, my druid is one of the few people having little or no problem with monsters - because of his bear companion.
