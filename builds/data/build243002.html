"The Kushiel Legacy", which is written by Jacqueline Carey. I drew some inspiration from a build called, "The Ko'Di Blade Master", made by Avendesora84 (Link Here: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "191493", "", "%29.", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> I mostly just referenced her build, and looked at how she did it, and then made my own...I didn't, for instance, copy her build, and then change aspects of it.<br><br>Anyway, I should probably explain some of the choices I made. First of all, the Dual-Wielding. I did this purely to imitate the Cassiline Brotherhood, who use their daggers when they don't wish to kill, and then switch to their Greatsword (it might be a bastard sword, but they typically wield it two-handed) when they are forced to kill. Their combat prowess is nearly unmatched, and they've been known to take down entire raiding parties alone, or with little help at all. They're assigned as a Guardian to important people. For instance, the King has two Cassiline Bodyguards who attend him at all times. I took Improved Expertise solely for when I use Daggers. Their aim is not to kill while they wield their daggers, but rather to go purely defensive, then if the enemy doesn't back down, or the person the're assigned to protect is put into danger, they'll unsheathe their sword and unleash death.<br><br>I'm usually very adamantly opposed to taking Devestating Critical, but I just thought this build wouldn't be complete without it. His Devastating Critical DC is only 40 without items, and with +12 Strength it's 46, 7 short of the maximum. It's not an amazing DC, but it is good enough for people not wearing a ton of +Fort Save. The Greatsword also crits on a 15-20, at a x3 modifier, with +2d6 damage added on from Overwhelming Critical. If you acquire a Keen weapon, or a Mage/Bard buffs you with Keen, your crit range becomes a very respectable 13-20.<br><br>At any rate, I don't have a lot to say about the build. Many of the choices made were for purely Roleplaying Purposes. Two-Weapon Fighting and Improved Expertise being the main.<br><br>As always, I'm completely open to Critiques, Comments, or Criticism. However, please don't mention to me that the build would be better without Dual-Wielding and Improved Expertise...I know. =)<br><br>&lt;edit&gt;<br><br>Oh, here's a skill Variant, if anyone's interested:<br>Drop Spot and Listen, get Hide and Move Silently. If you're equipping Robes, and have a +12 Dex item, you can sneak reasonably well. Not as good as a dedicated Dex Build, but enough to let you go undetected unless someone's -really- focused in Detection. You could sneak in Full Plate, as well...but only people who lack Spot/Listen will miss you, really.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Acothea on 06/06/06 07:05</span></i></p>

This might be a silly question, and if so, I apologize.  However, I was just thinking, isn't it better to be at level 20 with multiples of 4?  If so, might it not make sense to switch your lvl 20 and lvl 21 choices, so that at 20 you are F 12/WM 8?<br><br>If there's no difference, then no matter.

If you are willing to sacrifice 1 AB, you could take 6 monk levels, and get the monk bonuses much sooner (tumble, cleave, etc.). Take 4 Monk levels pre-epic, and skip taking Cleave, KD, and IKD. Assuming you drop fighter levels for monk, you lose 2 fighter feats, but get 3 for free, picking up 1 feat net. You also get 6 stunning fists instead of 2 per day, a point of Monk AC (probably useless since you will wear armor), and some monk speed (that's quite useful). You also now get kama proficiency early enough that you could use kamas as you weapon of choice (doesn't fit the RP, I know, but it might be a nice option for someone else making a variant on the build. Also gets 10 attacks per round when dual-wielding kamas). You unarmed damage also goes up in case you ever have to fight unarmed.<br><br>If you don't want to drop any fighter levels, you might want to consider something other than monk for the 2 remaining levels. Bard would get you Tumble, UMD, a weak song, and the ability to use all scrolls and wands. Rogue gets you Tumble, UMD, uncanny dodge,lots of other available skills to dump in, and a weak sneak attack. <br><br>TM

This thought is not only on this build, but on any devasting critical build meant for PvP. The character will face many devasting critters, and to survive you need to be able to resist devastings too. Unless you are lucky to land the first dev. critical hit you will die very fast! Much less than 30 fortitude or PM10 is hazard in a dev. critical world.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">

quoting the rules from NWNwiki.org:<br><br>Critical hit:<br>When you take a swing at your opponent, if your NATURAL (un-modified) to-Hit roll is within the threat range AND your modified roll is a hit (WITHOUT invoking the '20 always hits' rule), then you have scored a critical threat. A re-roll is then made with the SAME to-hit modifiers, and if the re-roll is also a hit, then your swing was a critical hit.<br><br>Example:<br>The Fighter has a total to-Hit bonus of +11 (+5 BAB, +4 STR, +1 Wpn Focus, +1 sword). If he rolls (on d20) 1-4 he misses the Goblin's AC:16. If he rolls 5-18 he hits, for normal damage. If he rolls 19 or 20 (within the Critical Threat range of his Longsword), then he hits, and a re-roll is made with the same to-Hit modifiers (+11 vs AC:16)... if the re-roll is 1-4, it's just a normal hit, but if the re-roll is 5-20 (the span he needed to-hit in the first place) then it's a Critical Hit.<br><br>Devastating critical:<br>Whenever a character inflicts a critical hit against an opponent, the opponent has to make a fortitude save or die instantly.

He can only hit you on a 20 roll (autohit). A roll of 20 is always a threat to crit. Now, he rolls the confirmation. Highest roll he can get is a 20, which is not good enough to hit your AC. Therefore the confirmation roll fails and the hit is not a critical (a roll of 20 is <i>not</i> an autohit on the confirmation roll). As a result, your opponent can <i>never</i> roll a crit on you and thus cannot land a Dev Crit (unless he finds some way to lower your AC, such as Taunt and/or Curse Song).<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Yes of course 25 AC higher than attackers AB is difficult to hit, actually almost untouchable, but I have'nt seen a devasting crit build with AC 75 yet!<br><br>I was taking about devasting critical builds defending against other dev critters here, and the aspect of dev-crit builds having defence against dev criticals). In that case an AC equal to the attacker AB is considered an very high AC I would say.<br><br>If your AC is equal the AB of the attacker, and the attacker has 4 attacks pr round you will recieve 2.6 hits pr round in avarage, and 0.8 criticals pr. round in avarage against an 15-20 threat range. Thats 4 savingthrows against death every 5 rounds. Now you must have the fortitude or you'll be dead in seconds. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">    <br><br>I've been doing some calcs in spreadsheet and here is the formula that calculate an attack's chance to deal a critical hit, and the chance to kill instantly if you have devastating critical.<br>Inputs variables:<br>AC = AC of defender<br>AB = AB of the attack<br>T = The weapons threat range in points (19-20 T=2, 15-20 T=6 etc)<br>DDC = Devastating critical DC of the attacker<br>F = Fortitude save modifier of the defender<br><br>R = 21-AC+AB (the hitrange on the d20, max 19, min 1)<br>M = T if R&gt;T<br>M = R if R&lt;=T<br>M = 0 if AC is 21 or more higher than AB<br>M is adjusting threat after confirmation roll<br>C = DDC-F (the failrange on the d20 to save devastating critical, max 19, min 1)<br><br>The attack's percentage chance to score a critical:<br>PCR = R*M/4 <br>The attack's percentage chance to kill instantly:<br>PDCR = PCR*C/20<br><br>Use this to see how different variables affect the criticals <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By blixen71 on 09/22/06 08:12</span></i></p>

We know that Devastating Crit is strong to the point where it's bootleg. But since you dropped the comment on this build, which attempts to get AC as high as possible, it's notable to point out the problems with getting crits on certain AC totals.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

As I said in my initial post here this was a general thought about devasting critical meant for PvP, not this build in particular. So maybe this discussion should be in the general section <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">
