Wailing Whiplash <br><br>Unfortunately this is the same class mix as a previous effort. However my version is a Strength based build with a higher AB, an improved skillset, which allows an unbuffed Taunt of 56. No idea on AC or save comparisons, as these were not shown originally.

It's cool conceptually.  Minor tweaks necessary in some instances, build to taste in others:<br><br>1. Lasting inspiration has to be taken at level 21 as it is not available at level 20.  <br><br>2. Whip? Just kidding. <br><br>3. Moved some feats around to get higher AB earlier and moved some classes around.  Took the WeaponMaster crit multiplier earlier.  Once you aren't racing to get lasting inspiration at Level 33, you can shift the WM levels earlier.  I apportioned it such that you get your level 16 bard song early and then pushed for the 6th and 7th WM levels but you could justify moving those levels even earlier, like after the Level 11 bard song.  <br><br>1.
