The Hillgrass Tornado<br><br>They say that in the lands where the old halfling villages dwell, the crops are low and the grass grows tall. Unguarded by walls or towers, the hilly hamlets that are shrouded in the long tresses of the earth's hair would seem to be prime targets for raiders, be they orc or man. And yet still they stand, and those barbarians who have dared to draw steel in the homes of the halflings speak of lost legs and terrible wounds, and of scythings tornadoes that strike from invisible places in the high grass, as untouchable as they are deadly.<br><br>I worked on this one last night and a bit this morning. My first thought was to have more rogue levels, but I couldn't quite find a good fit until I worked it out like this. Elf might be better or it might not (+1 AB, -1 AC, +1 damage, -40 hp), but it's a nil point because of the XP penalty. Human might work, but I had issues putting it together without a dex bonus.<br><br>In any case, I rather like the concept - reminds me of the first users of the kama, okinawan martial artists who turned their farm tools into weapons.<br><br>Rogue 29/Fighter 6/Monk 5<br>Race: Halfling<br>Alignment: Non-Lawful<br>Playable: 1-40, Any PvM<br><br>Attributes<br>Str 6<br>Int 14<br>Wis 12<br>Dex 20 (32)<br>Con 12<br>Chr 8<br><br>Level Guide<br>1 Rogue 1, Toughness<br>2 Fighter 1, Weapon Finesse<br>3 Monk 1, WF: Kama<br>4 Rogue 2, Dex 21<br>5 Rogue 3<br>6 Fighter 2, Ambidexterity, TWF<br>7 Monk 2<br>8 Rogue 4, Dex 22<br>9 Rogue 5, KD<br>10 Rogue 6<br>11 Fighter 3<br>12 Monk 3, ITWF, Dex 23<br>13 Rogue 7<br>14 Rogue 8<br>15 Rogue 9, IKD<br>16 Fighter 4, WS: Kama, Dex 24<br>17 Monk 4<br>18 Rogue 10, Blind Fight, Improved Evasion<br>19 Rogue 11<br>20 Rogue 12, Dex 25<br>21 Rogue 13, Great Dexterity I, Defensive Roll<br>22 Rogue 14<br>23 Rogue 15<br>24 Rogue 16, Great Dexterity II, Epic Dodge, Dex 28<br>25 Rogue 17<br>26 Fighter 5<br>27 Monk 5, EWF: Kama<br>28 Rogue 18, Dex 29<br>29 Rogue 19, Crippling Strike<br>30 Rogue 20, Epic Prowess<br>31 Rogue 21<br>32 Rogue 22, Dex 30<br>33 Rogue 23, SC I<br>34 Rogue 24, SC II<br>35 Rogue 25<br>36 Rogue 26, SC III, Dex 31<br>37 Rogue 27<br>38 Rogue 28, SC IV<br>39 Fighter 6, SC V, EWS: Kama<br>40 Rogue 29, Dex 32<br><br>Combat Vitals<br>Single Wield AB: 42/39/36/33/30/27<br>Dual Wield AB: 38/38/35/35/32/29/26/23<br>Base Damage: 1-6+4<br>AC: 32<br>HP: 354<br><br>Saves<br>Fort: 24 (28)<br>Will: 21 (25)<br>Reflex: 35 (39)<br><br>Skills: 374<br>Concentration 42 (43)<br>Discipline: 42 (40)<br>Spellcraft: 18 (20)<br>Tumble: 40 (51)<br>Taunt: 21 (20)<br>UMD: 41 (40)<br><br>Strengths<br>- 15d6 sneak attack + crippling strike + 10 max APR<br>- 110% Movement Rate<br>- High reflex save<br>- UMD<br>- Fairly decent AC<br>- ED/SC V<br>- EWS<br>- Monk cheese<br><br>Weaknesses<br>- Damage against enemies immune to sneak attacks is ridiculously low (helped by EWS)<br>- Low dual-weild AB (made up for partially by monk attack schedule) limits dual weilding to situations with available sneak attacks<br>- Low will and fortitude saves<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 12/17/06 16:31</span></i></p>

I would think Ythaniel was being sarcastic, because, even as you don't quite lack many feats, you don't have so much as feats to spare like if KD/IKD was nothing (and changing KD/IKD for Iron Will and Strong Soul!? obviously a joke). Playability is a point, valid and all, I guess taking the feat isn't wrong, but think what could replace 2 feats, if playability wasn't too much of a problem, you could simply retard Fighter levels to epic and those 2 feats could become meaninful.<br><br>Nice build.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/19/06 02:48</span></i></p>

Of course, APR, forget I said a thing. <br><br>Hmmm, let's try it the other way around, Monk 5 only gives you 1 AC where Rogue or Fighter would give no more, so why can't you take Fighter 6 sooner? EWS is a great playability addition, as for sneak immunes, and you can skilldump discipline with Monk instead, what do you think about it?
