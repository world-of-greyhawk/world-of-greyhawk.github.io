Heh... While I appreciate the fact that Blaze007 designed a couple versions of my favorite character, I feel that he did a poor job of it. <br><br>I am not sure of the amount of people here who are familiar with Krynn and this uber mage, but... for those of you who are, I am quite sure that you are equally jealous of his power and fame.<br><br>I challenge you all to a contest to see who can make t he most identical character build to the one depicting in the Dragonlance novels.<br><br>Of course we will be building the Blackrobed versions.<br>Lets take into consideration that we will be building towards his personality and power around the time of his destruction.<br><br>If Caramon hadn't turned Raist into a sissy <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  then we would have seen Raist at the peak of his power, but we will leave that aside from this little contest. It would be nice to hear everyones speculations about what power you think he would have attained given the destruction of the Queen of Darkness.

But take into consideration that he didn't gain power like the rest of his peers. I would say that he hit around lvl 20 by his own, and then after completely his Wizard trials at the High Tower of Sorcery he was granted an instant amount of levels. But not instant 40 because he didn't in fact take over Fistandauntilus' "soul" until much later in his life. <br><br>Some would say that he wouldn't even be considered a lvl 40 PC in NWN. I contest that theory because having all of Fistandauntilus' power would actually quialify him as being a mortal DM in PC mode. <br><br>Some would also say that his pupil Dalamar would have been a much stronger master of the arts because he had much more time to study the art of magic. Meh.. how many years of knowledge did Raist acquire by overtaking Fistandauntilus? 100's.... and a huge amount of spellbooks and literature.<br><br>I have made PM versions of Raist and pure Wiz versions, but I will leave the topic open for the rest of us Dragonlance fans to discuss and debate here on the ECB Forums!<br><br>Enjoy <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>To Haseo:<br><br>I might drop his base Wisdom 2 points and his Dex 2 points to increase his Charisma.

Sure everyone viewed him as being "The Dark One" but.... this set aside, he deserves a little bit more CHA IMO! The 10 Dex seems a little bit high considering he was by no means an agile being at any point in his life. <br><br>His power revolved around his Wisdom, Intelligence, and his own drive to be the best, "Selfishness!"

Ah but didn't Raistlin also kill the other gods and went head to head against Tiamat?  I forget why he backed down or protected himself in that last fight... it's been awhile since I read the series..<br><br>I'd say he was at least lvl 40 in that timeline.<br><br>1 rogue level for some PP (slight of hand) skills.  He used that trick to impress a mage during those tests in an anti magic zone.<br><br>I don't think I'd vote for palemaster since you don't need to be a palemaster to be a lich.  Palemasters are a philosophically different offshoot of Mages.  They focus on undead stuff.  Raistlin didn't do that.

I'd put him as a Wizard 40; though I would start him in NWN as an elf despite the fact he isn't one.  reasoning would be to better portray the absolute frailty of his physical being.

Kail is right <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>What about Spell Focus: Illusion to replicate his early childhood street magic of making Illusions?<br><br>And about the whole Undead thing.... the High Tower of Sorcery at Palanthas was swarming with undead, which he had complete control over. That was the key factor in justifying a PM version. And his "touch" which scarred Dalamar for life for his betrayal, would closely represent some of the PM touch attacks wouldn't you say.<br><br>At any rate I was more pleased with the higher caster lvl which makes him more powerful, damage wise.<br><br>And hrmmm I can't decide whether to take 2 SD or 1 Rogue... or maybe 2 Assassin. OR does anyone object to taking Uncanny Dodge? How does everyone percieve his reflexes and perception of his surroundings and his ability to detect enemies? I know that while he was in his tent on the Plains during the Dwarven War, he was actually killed by a lethal sneak attack from a DWARF, ROFL..So I wouldnt say he was all that.. jk ..  I forget how he was saved that time.. Wasn't it some magical potion that he was saving for a long time that would kinda of replicate greater restoration and/or resurrection?<br><br>I think I am gonna go to Barnes and Noble and buy the series again. I lost it while moving <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br> He was quite a stealthy little bastard <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  So the HIPS might compliment him quite well. The only thing that bugs me about SD is that I feel Raistlin should possess some UMD because he has quite an arsenal of artifacts and trinkets... but he just chooses not to use them. Except the  Dragon Orb, which would be a Wizard/Sorcerer specific item in-game.<br><br>Any thoughts?

Is Dragonlance really the same D&amp;D rules and NWN operates with? I thought it was a somewhat different system than the Forgotten Realms...<br><br>Looks like I'll have to invest in more than just one Dragonlance book to have a decent shot in this contest. Unless I make a non-epic build, but that won't suit in here will it? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>But arent almost all magical items and trinkets wizard specific? So UMD sort of seems a little off. But mabye a Wiz19/Rogue1 could be a decent staringpoint. Taking rogue after lv 16 for an UMD dump. And I'd probably take appraise, and mabye persuation/intimidate as well.<br><br>Wants more time off to read... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">

k, since dragonlance doesnt use all the same feats and such that nwn uses, here's my take:  Use the PRC mod and make a wiz/rwot/rog2 for skil dumps!  I know red wizs arent dragonlance, but so what!  we are talkin about an UBER caster and using PMS!  LOL  The prc has rwot gaining a feat  Spell Power +1 every 2 even lvls (iirc - otherwize its odd and they get spell def every other lvl).  Either way, every lvl of rwot gives HUGE bonuses.  <br><br>THe question though is this: to take rwot you must give up 2 spell schools.  WHich 2?  Why?<br><br>Just my 2 cents.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

There isnt even a kindersley in nwn!!  And smallnutz, its avado...  not sure why you can't read.  <br><br>AHH!!  Now i understand!  You cant read so you try to look at all the pictures in dragonlance tombs!  btw, didnt they all die way back in 1980?  That's one heck of a long time, infact, before you was born smallfry!!  <br><br>1000's of dragonlance fans!  HOW?  What ever happend to all those dragonlance servers..  oh right, EXTINCT!<br><br>btw, all i suggested was using the PRC mod to replicate a long extinct character cuz, quite honestly, it is more plausable than tryin to use a dwarf or gnome or halfer for a kinderkind=o-waste!<br><br>and for the record, I was a huge fan of dragonlance way back when I was in diapers.  THen I grew up and started to read Harry potter!  Next we will try to replicate harry potter on nwn. Oh, wait.  Harry is still ALIVE!
