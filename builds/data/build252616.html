Baldrick the Palebard (Bard 10/Champion of Torm 14/Pale Master 16)<br><br>I have tried the character Haunted Hymnsinger of Torm (HHoT) by MauvaisGuillame and have tried to modify him to maybe improve him. HHoT is a very good character I think, and I like playing this mix of classes. Personally I think this version of the build is slightly improving it. What is your opinion on this.<br><br>Differences between Baldrick and HHoT:<br>- Baldrick is human. He takes weapon proficiency martial and armor proficiency heavy early and focuses in scimitar for improved critical treat range (15-20 x2)<br>- He has strength 28, so 1 more AB than HHoT. He only have 15 charisma, but have one more Bard level so he can cast level 4 spells. He also have extend spell so he can metamagic 3 level 4 spells in the level 5 slots. <br>- He has 14 constitution, and 10 dexterity so he does not have to take any toughness feats to have approximately the same HP. Total HP is 399, 29 less than HHoT, but he uses full plate armor and a tower shield. The unbuffed AC is 39.<br>- Saves are approximately the same.<br>- Baldrick has epic mage armor (HHoT can chose this yes)<br>- Baldrick spesialize in the taunt skill, having 55 ranks. This means that opponents he taunt will as good as always drop 6 AC for 5 rounds if they don’t have a maximized concentration skill. I think the taunt skill is very good.<br>- Improved knockdown and blind fight instead of whirlwind attack and expertise.<br>- Lingering song for longer bard songs.<br>- The divine wrath, smite evil and Lay on Hands is one level less then HHoT.<br>- Baldrick has maximized UMD skill, still some concentration (he is not combat casting, only self buffing before combat) and some heal skill.<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: TN or CN<br>Ability stats:<br>STR: 16 (28)<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 14 (15)<br><br>Leveling:<br><br>1.

Have you tested this build in a leveller? Because I'm afraid I may have bad news.<br><br>Although PM will add the extra castings per day you'd receive for the 'as if levelling in your spellcasting class', it will not open up new spell levels for you. You can only open up new spell levels if you take enough Bard level s to do so (in this case, you'd need to have at least 13 Bard levels to gain access to level 5 spells) This means with only 10 Bard levels, you will not open up level 5 spell slots, even though you have lots of PM levels and 15 CHA. You'll be stuck with only level 4 spell slots (but you'll have as many castings per day of your level 1 through 4 spells as if you were a level 18 Bard).<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Sorry Cinn, but you may not be able to <b>know</b> any lvl 5 Bard spells, however they can be filled with Metamagic slots.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Because they do not gain any spells from leveling in the Pale Master class, Sorcerers and Bards can only make use of the higher spell slots they gain by using metamagic feats. Wizards, however, can easily make use of the new spell slots by scribing spell scrolls into their spellbook, making the Wizard a much more viable class requirement for Pale Masters than Sorcerers or Bards. </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>As the OP states:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Level 5: 3 x extended Improved invisibility (20 turns), (50% concealment)</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>He never intended to be able to cast lvl 5 bard spells (potentially because they suck!!!) however merely use the higher level to extend his spells...though IMO lvl 5 Bard spells should be solely reserved for extended WarCrys as it's Verbal only...

Yes, Baldrick is tested and all worked well concerning the spell casting. He got 3 extended spells in the level 5 slots.<br><br>Just a few small corrections:<br>- Alignment should be true neutral indeed yes.<br>- Threat range with keen edge scimitar is 12-20, not 13-20 as stated.<br>- He should take armor proficiency heavy at level 3, and weapon focus at level 6, as that will obviosly be best at the low levels.<br>- When I think about it, maybe it would be smart to take the cleave feats before improved critical?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By blixen71 on 09/13/06 07:48</span></i></p>

I have been playing this Baldrick dude a lot now, and he is very hard to beat indeed. He is qualifying to be my favorite actually.<br><br>He just throws up the long lasting EMA (AC59), buffs AB and DMG to about 48-50, makes a +3 keen scimitar, sings a song (tralalala <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  ) and finally add 50% concealment to himself, and becomes a nightmare. He still has epic warding, divine wrath, taunt, haste and smite evil in backup.<br><br>BUT he has problem beating spesialist wizards with those nasty damage returing shields. Does anyone have any suggestions on strategies to beat those roasters, or is it impossible? I haven't figured it out. I tried using ranged attacks but that wouldnt bite with base ranged AB of 27.<br><br>Modifications to the build after testing:<br><br>- Toughness instead of improved knockdown. 439 HP maxed<br>- Full concentration skill, no heal skill, 19 (21) UMD only for scrolls and wands.<br>- Learn greater magic weapon instead of slow.<br><br>I have made a no-devastating critical version of him to use if devcritters are banned:<br><br>- Same leveling up and ability stats<br>- APH level 1, WPE or WPM at level 3, and fokus in a high damage slashing weapon.<br>- Replace the overwhelming and devastating feats with Epic prowess and anoter epic feat of choise, and rearrange the epic feats order as you like.<br><br>- +1 AB and higher base damage

Thank you very much for those tips Mick <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Seems to help a lot. It is still challenging to fight those shieldmages, but this strategy will work with good timing, some training and a bit of luck I hope.<br><br>First the epic taunt, then dispelling with scrolls or Dispel Magic and finally the silence spell and charge with haste.<br><br>I replaced Sound Burst with Silece in Baldrick's spell reportoir.<br><br>It wouldn't surprice me if those shieldmages have some counterstrategies though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By blixen71 on 09/22/06 18:38</span></i></p>

The best strategy hands-down vs shield-mages is to spam Knockdown with a holy avenger.
