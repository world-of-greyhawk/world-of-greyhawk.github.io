As our good friend was saying the cleric is very misunderstood.  If you start focusing on the spells of the cleric you begin to understand the unlimited power that you can wield.  For instance the fluff and often overlooked Lvl 1 spell Shield of Faith which gives you a plus 2 deflection bonus to your AC and an additional +1 per 6 lvls you can see that your armor can easily get better, and without suffering the penalties of arcane magic (no casting in armor) you can still wear plate mail and cast your spells.<br>Second look at the Level 3 spell continual flame which cast on a weapon gives you a permanant light source and I mean the weapon will be enchanted with light permanantly.  Then look at the lvl 3 spell Magic circle against alignment and you get another plus 2 bonus to AC and a plus 2 bonus to saving throws as well as imunity to mind affecting spells all against a specific alignment.  And these are just the low level spells.  Once you can cast level 6, 7, and 8 level spells you will see that you can really alter your cleric to make him just as strong as a fighter.  More come later.  And all you cleric lovers feel free to chime in with more info on NWN's most underappreciated class.<br>9)

acurly my experence most of the time people say cleric is the most powerfull...<br><br>but anyway my point! a cleric fully buffed is a force to be reconed, but unbuffed there not so. which means dispell magic, surprise and time are the greatist weapeons against clerics. another thing to keep in mind is alot of there buff power can be given to other characters therefore...<br><br>cleric+ a fighter is better than two fighter or two cleric.<br>_________________<br>the number of questions people ask that could be simply answered by looking in the manual is simply amazing....
