Here's what I got so far...<br><br>Fighter<br><br>Race: Halfling<br><br>Attributes:<br>Strength: 14(Axes way 1 pound Each O.o)<br>Dex: 17<br>Wisdom: 10<br>Charisma: 10<br>Intell: 14<br><br>Feats: Weapon Focus: Throwing Axe.  Weapon Finesse.<br><br>Then I took Rogue, as my second level for the sneak.<br><br>Now, I was wondering where I should go with it...More Fighter for more AB, or more Rogue for more Damage.<br><br>Maybe some suggest pattern in leveling to optimize my skills and such.<br><br>Oh, and for Skills: Appraise/Discipline/ Heal/Openlock/Tumble.  Then I'm going to go on and take Set and Disable Trap.<br><br><br>Any Ideas or suggestions?<br>_________________<br>~Blake~

Why 10 Cha and 10 Wis? you're not gonna be able to cast anything like that and you could use the 4 points gained to up constitution.. (which I just noticed ISNT on your attr list?)<br>All hail stupidity!<br><br>Rogue to 7 and get the SD pre reqs on the way.. then you could take fighter 8 levels to get the BAB for 4 attacks .. maybe? and weapon spec and EWF. Yeah.. I is stupid and I just got up <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-DaMouse

I don't see the point.. 8 for each doesn't seem to lose much.. it requires 1 more skill point for UMD and -1 will save.. oh woohoo.. yet you get 4 stat points more which can help raise your base stats at level 1..I'd say that's worth 1 will save and skill point..<br><br>-DaMouse

Well it's RP, and I don't like to have an I don't like having Negative Skills.  We do alot of rolling on the server I play.<br><br>And, we have banned SD, I would have been smart enough, to take SD.<br><br>yes, I do think i forgot Con, but it's 10.<br>_________________<br>~Blake~

Is it forbidden to be ugly (below average charisma) or ignorant (below average wisdom) in your server?... Elitists! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>I never understand that kind of restrictions, it is RP, you should be able to be clumsy, weak, stupid, ignorant, ugly or brittle, why not? And... I dont understand why RP servers also ban classes, why? if it were a PvP server it would be logic, it can unbalance things. But... in RP servers?<br><br>I feel relieved now <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> .<br>_________________<br>HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh.

level the no Negative Abilities is my preference, and we banned Shadow Dancers cause, we didn't think it was RPful, that you can run right infront of someone then hide.<br><br>If a RPer earns the right to play it, through RP then we let him have it, but not somethign i'm prepared to do <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>~Blake~
