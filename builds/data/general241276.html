I'm not so familiar with mages and as I was experimenting with one I noticed the quicken and auto-matic quicken spell feats.<br><br>Does it work like it sounds and let you cast spells faster? I never knew how many spells mages could cast per round but from this feat's description I would assume one (unless you have the feats of course)<br><br>Anyway, if it works like I'm thinkin then these feats should be a must have for a mage, right?

Unforunately, no. Quicken acts the same as Haste. You normally can cast 1 spell per round, but you get 2 with Haste or Quicken (they don't stack). So, if you can Haste yourself or get an item that grants Haste, the Quicken line becomes superfluous.<br>_________________<br>Where I'm playing now: <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk.</a>

Unfortunately, for anyone who can cast the Haste spell (which is every arcane caster and clerics with the Travel domain), quicken spell and autoquicken spell are wastes of feats.<br><br>Extended Hastes will have the same effect (and increase your AC and movement speed and combat ability).<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

It should be noted that while autoquickened spells should be uninterruptable and uncounterspellable the feat ain't working really properly,  so in the end you're better off with haste.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

Quicken spell can still be useful.  You can use it to manage your spell book.  Since virtually every spell can be quickened, you can memorize extra copies of low level spells in higher level slots.  Granted most people use slient spell or still spell for this.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Still and Silent use 1-level-higher... not sure if most people want to cast 5th level spells using up 9th level slots.  And not be able to quicken 6th or higher level spells.
