Here is the rogue version - again, the Int is costing you Dex, and you get ED fairly late. Everything advances somewhat slowly due to the need to balance Fighter and Rogue levels. This build will mature late. If you can use the portals by boosting Int with potions or items, you could leave it at 10 (+5 from a potion of Fox's cunning when you want to use the portal), which would let you boost Dex by 2 and get ED significantly earlier in both builds.<br><br>Monk(20), Fighter(10), Rogue(10), Human<br>STR: 14<br>DEX: 14 (28)<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 14 (15)<br>CHA: 8<br>Hitpoints: 440<br>Skillpoints: 321<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 24/21/31<br>BAB: 26<br>AB (max, naked): 39 (melee), 36 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 35/35<br>L01: M(1): Toughness, Dodge, M: (Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist)<br>L02: M(2): M: (Deflect Arrows)<br>L03: F(1): Weapon Focus: Kama, Weapon Finesse<br>L04: F(2): DEX+1, Ambidexterity, (DEX=15)<br>L05: Ro(1)<br>L06: Ro(2): Two-Weapon Fighting<br>L07: Ro(3): Ro: (Uncanny Dodge I)<br>L08: F(3): DEX+1, (DEX=16)<br>L09: F(4): Blind Fight, Weapon Specialization: Kama<br>L10: M(3)<br>L11: M(4)<br>L12: M(5): INT+1, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, (INT=15)<br>L13: M(6): M: (Knockdown, Improved Knockdown)<br>L14: M(7)<br>L15: M(8): Improved Critical: Kama<br>L16: M(9): DEX+1, M: (Improved Evasion), (DEX=17)<br>L17: M(10): M: (KI Strike +1)<br>L18: M(11): Mobility, M: (Diamond Soul)<br>L19: Ro(4)<br>L20: F(5): DEX+1, (DEX=18)<br>L21: Ro(5): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=19)<br>L22: F(6): Epic Weapon Focus: Kama<br>L23: Ro(6)<br>L24: Ro(7): DEX+1, Great Dexterity II, (DEX=21)<br>L25: F(7)<br>L26: F(8): Epic Weapon Specialization: Kama<br>L27: Ro(8): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=22)<br>L28: Ro(9): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br>L29: F(9)<br>L30: F(10): Great Dexterity IV, Epic Prowess, (DEX=24)<br>L31: M(12): M: (Diamond Body)<br>L32: M(13): DEX+1, M: (KI Strike +2), (DEX=25)<br>L33: Ro(10): Epic Dodge, Defensive Roll<br>L34: M(14)<br>L35: M(15)<br>L36: M(16): DEX+1, Armor Skin, M: (KI Strike +3), (DEX=26)<br>L37: M(17)<br>L38: M(18)<br>L39: M(19): Great Dexterity V, (DEX=27)<br>L40: M(20): DEX+1, (DEX=28)<br><br>TM

I don't know what's your thing with Kamas, TM, but if I were going with 20 Monk levels anyway, I would use fists. Each to his own. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">
