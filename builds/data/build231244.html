I have been experimenting with Cleric / Monk builds for quite a while and though they are some of the best builds around (in my opinion anyway <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif"> ) - they can have high AC, have high ABs, plus with useful healing spells and buffs...<br><br>...the 3rd class in general doesn't affect the final outcome of the build TOO much as they have already been herded towards a goal with the first 2! 1 BAB base classes will give that often idealised 6th fisting attack, whereas Rogues can give Epic dodge but more importantly Uncanny Dodge II...<br><br>...However I think with the Dwarvern Deffender you almost get the best of both worlds...in other words: DEFENSIVE AWARENESS<br><br>Just to check that no-one had trod the ground before I did a little search and found:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "207678", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>the Self Reliant Monk</a><br><br>Not too bad a build, however this is focussed towards (in his own words):<br><br><i>1) To obtain max-dual wielding # of attacks <br>2) To require little or no magical equipment <br>3) To take the best advantage of the synergy of monk abilities (attacks, imp ev., etc), cleric AB buffs, and dwarven defender DR. My hope was that this would generate a fun to play, well-balanced character.</i><br><br>My goal however is to put a 3rd class to my 15 Cleric 6 Monk base build...damage reduction is just a handy little side affect...the main reason for DD levels is the Defensive Awareness &amp; 1 base BAB.<br><br>So I introduce:<br><br><b>the Lord of the Holy Fist</b><br>Fully Playable <b>1-40 PvA</b>...though the first few levels before you get Weapon Finesse can be tricky!<br><br>Warning this build has an XP penalty at lvls 5 &amp; 6 AND from lvl 10 upwards.<br><br><b>RACE : </b>Dwarf<br><br><b>ALIGNMENT :</b>Any Lawful<br><br><b>ABILITIES :</b><br><br>Starting Stats <b>Finishing Stats</b> <i>Ideally Buffed w.

Very nice AB, and that DEX also gives AC, but I can't forget to note the damage is not too high.<br><br>I would drop Dwarven Defender levels for Monk levels, at least 2 for improved evasion (although that DEX should give a fine reflex, you say you have only 29, which is not high) since you're already close to it, but also to increase damage on unarmed strike.... but you'll lose a feat.... so I think that using a kama gives you a better damage, you do lose stunning fist but you DC is not high anyway (27?).<br><br>While using a kama you can use also two kamas, change dodge, ESF, and either a great dex or toughness to get ambidexterity, TWF and ITWF, 2 more attacks per round at a cost of -2 AB (and the feats).<br><br>I would go for a Cleric 15/monk 9/DD 16, change dodge for ambidexterity, ESF for TWF and great dex for ITWF, you will also lose a feat, but if you lose 1 great dex  for ITWF and the great dex of the lost feat you will end losing 1 AB and 1 AC (2 for dodge), but gain 2 APR and your kamas will deal more than your unarmed.  (darkfire works really great, at least on low level and low magical environments)

Dodge is a Dwarvern Defender pre-requisite feat, so you cannot really drop that <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>I quoted a lot of the stats with a +12 bonus to the abilities, however I did not put this in with the saving throws, so ALL saves would have +6 as well! I know a lot of people may not like posting with +12, however with empowered spells able to give +7 and defensive stance giving a few +4 this is not at all unreasonable in this build!<br><br>There is no point, apart from extra hit points, from having 16 DwD levels instead of 14, so if you wanted to put in some extra Monk levels, you could drop DwD by 4, putting 3 into Monk &amp; 1 into Cleric: (Cleric 16, Monk 10, DwD 14) : this would give an extra 7th and 8th level spell, +10% speed bonus +1 AC &amp; 1-12 Fisting Damage, losing 3/- damage reduction &amp; 1 feat: Epic Prowess. Swap a Great Dexterity for Epic Prowess &amp; another for Armor Skin and the only loss is 1 AB &amp; 3/- DR<br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!

Your fist damage is 1-8 vs. a kama's 1-6, but you can cast GMW (+5), Darkfire (1-6 + 9), and use a magical one (replace the +5 from GMW with whatever the max enhancement on the PW or Module is). If your PW has +10 gloves and kamas, the kama's add +10 to damage, the gloves do not (AB only). So you could be adding +10 physical, and 1-6 +9 fire damage compared to gloves for an average of 21.5 more per hit, fairly significant.<br><br>BTW, I am pretty sure you can still deflect arrows with a single kama (although not when dual-wielding). You can still use Stunning Fist by simply assigning a hotkey to switch between gloves and kama.<br><br>TM
