Sorry about not posting the similar builds, didn't remember to do so, same with the strength gains.<br><br>I can't edit my own post above, not sure why, but I looked over the field agent and I believe there are some substantial differences there in the feats taking, especially, as you mentioned, dual wielding, which I prefer in my sneakers.  I also have ESF:Spot &amp; ESF: Discipline.  The discipline is needed to make up for small size with knockdowns.<br><br>Anyway, I am now level 17 on this build, just got crippling strike, and I love it.  I hate true sight though and think it should only show people using magical effects to obscure themselves, and with casters as overpowered as they already are, they don't need that ontop of it all, but yeah that is a bit off topic.
