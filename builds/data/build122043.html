<b>Straight level 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>Here's a little something I've been playing about with in my head. I'm at work right now so I've got no NWN to test it out so there may be a few errors. It may well suck anyway, it has Harper Scout levels. Oh, and I've presumed that epic Shadowdancers get bonus feats every three levels, which I haven't been able to check. If they don't this build can be safely ignored.<br><br>Race: Orcblood Elf<br>The Orc heritage in this elf's family has reared its pug-ugly head once more. No one knows how it got there; or rather, they do, but it's not spoken of in polite society. But the Orcblood Elf has not only a natural ugliness, but also an affinity for typically Orc weapons. As he reaches maturity, he has found it easier to hide his face away from his fellow elves, rather than risk their scorn and enmity. His natural status of outsider-looking-in, his natural spy-like nature, and his desire to prove his worth to his elven community, has led him to find acceptance with a rather specialised group: the Harpers.<br><br>Starting stats:<br>Str 14 (+6)<br>Dex 20 (+16)<br>Con 8 (+2)<br>Int 10 (+2)<br>Wis 12 (+4)<br>Cha 8<br><br>Put points into Dex up to level 28. Then put points into Strength at 32, 36 and 40.<br>Level progression:<br>10 * Ranger, putting points into Hide, Move Silently, Lore (up to 6 ranks), Discipline (up to 4 ranks) and cross-classing Tumble (up to 5 ranks)<br>10 * Shadowdancer, putting points into Hide, Move Silently, Tumble, Search (up to 4 ranks), Persuade (up to 8 ranks)<br>5 * Harper Scout, putting points into Hide, Move Silently, Tumble and wherever else you want<br>15 * Shadowdancer, putting points into Hide, MS, Tumble and again, wherever else you want<br><br>You need to take a lot of píss-poor feats pre-epic to make this character work. Hopefully it works out in the end.<br><br>1 - Dodge, Favoured Enemy 1<br>3 - Mobility<br>5 - Favoured Enemy 2<br>6 - Toughness<br>9 - Weapon Focus: Double Axe<br>10 - Favoured Enemy 3<br>12 - Alertness<br>15 - Iron Will<br>18 - Improved Critical: Double Axe<br>21 - Epic Weapon Focus: Double Axe, Great Dex 1* (making it 26)<br>24 - Great Dex 2 (-&gt;28)<br>25 - Great Dex 3* (-&gt;29)<br>27 - Great Strength 1<br>28 - Epic Dodge**<br>30 - Great Strength 2<br>31 - Self Concealment 1**<br>33 - Great Strength 3 (-&gt;18)<br>34 - Self Concealment 2**<br>36 - Self Concealment 3<br>37 - Epic Shadowlord**<br>39 - Self Concealment 4<br>40 - Self Concealment 5**<br><br>* = Harper Scout bonus feat<br>** = Shadowdancer bonus feat<br><br>First off I'd like to say this idea came to me while I was trying not to fall asleep at work. And if epic shadowdancers get feats every 4 levels instead of every 3 then this guy will suck, a lot.<br><br>If this works though the Orcblood Harper Elf will have a lot of things going for him. The double axe gives him 1d8 in either hand and 10 Ranger levels lets him wield it properly. He gets 4 base attacks per round, +2 from Improved Two Weapon Fighting, and a further +1 if he can find a Haste item. That gives him a possible 7 attacks per round. Five of them are doing 1d8+7 damage with a mundane unbuffed double axe. The other two are doing 1d8+5, thanks to the double weapon giving the off hand attacks full strength bonus to damage and 50% more to the main hand. So, with only a haste item, and no critical hits, the Orcblood Harper Elf does a minimum of 52 damage per round providing every attack hits. Erm.....dammit, that sucks compared to everyone else's builds.<br><br>Even though his damage may not be too great, it's better than if he dual-wielded two small weapons or two kukris or something. He does get a x3 critical as well so it's maybe not TOO bad. The main advantage of this build though, is the full 50% concealment, Epic Dodge, +3 to Favoured Enemies, Hide in Plain Sight, and the nice warm glow you feel inside from role-playing a nice Harper Scout. Oh who am I kidding, this build sucks! If anyone can find a use for him or suggest any improvements, I'd be happy to hear them.<br><br>Edited By Herbie Shimmer on 03/29/04 10:11:55<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 07/07/05 23:49</span></i></p>
