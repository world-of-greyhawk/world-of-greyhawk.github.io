Ok I'm closing in on finalizing my build but I still have some questions. I want to make sure I have everything right because on the server I play on it takes awhile to lvl up and I don't want to waste a lot of time lvling a character and then find out I screwed up on something.<br><br>Ok the server I play on has a moded TS so that it just adds to your spot and listen check. So this means that sneakers with a high hide/ms can go unseen. This is the only thing that I'm worried about at this point. My character will own anyone except a sneaker at this point. I posted awhile ago about some feats that I couldn't decide upon. Well I've been doing some more messing around and here are the choices I have. Some of these choices are only possible because of items I have on my server. There are 3 feats that I can change depending on the choice I go with. Armor Skin, blind fight, and Epic Warding.<br><br>1. I can replace one of the above with Epic skill focus: Listen and do the following. I can max out my Listen to 43 + Epic Skill focus(+10) + amplify(+20 listen) + clarovoyance(+10 spot/listen) + greater watchmens helm(+20 spot/listen) - 1(wisdom modifier) = 102 listen.<br>On top of this I can enter detect mode and add 1d20 to my spot and listen check. At least I think detect mode adds to listen.<br><br>Blind fight would probably be the best choice to replace because if I can see someone then the feat is pretty useless. Also maxing out Listen requires that I put no points into concentration which isn't bad since I won't be casting spells in combat and no one on my server uses taunt.<br><br>2. I can replace Epic Warding with Dragon Knight and just summon a red dragon everytime I suspect that someone is sneaking around. That way the dragons TS will see the sneaker. Although it won't be a match for a lvl 40 sneaker it will give me an idea where it is and it is immune to sneak attacks. Epic Warding won't last long since I'm not a high lvl spell caster so this is another idea I thought of. Plus it could provide a destraction when fighting spellcasters.<br><br>3. I could just keep my build the way it is and not put any points into listen. I have a shape changing ring on my server that just changes you into mundane creatures but one of the shapes is an umber hulk which has TS. I could do this when I encounter a sneaker so that I can see him. I would be pretty useless but at least I could see him. <br><br>These are the 3 choices of action that I have vs. sneakers on my server.<br><br>Depending on the choice I choose I'm also flirting with the idea of replacing Epic Warding with Epic skill focus: Taunt for those high spell casters. Epic Warding is awesome but it doesn't last long on my build.<br><br>Sorry if all this doesnt make sense but let me know what you guys think.

Don't casters typically boost their concentration along with spellcraft?<br><br>Concentration helps protect from taunt, and casting during or near melle combat.<br><br>===============<br><br>I'm not sure which would be the better choice: Listen or Spot.<br><br>Spot may also help detect a Pick Pocket attempt (sadly not prevent).

Blind fight doesnt help you at all against sneakers, it helps against concealment. Concealment is different from stealth in that stealth you either see them or you dont. Concealment means that you even though you can see them you have an outright chance to miss with spell /melee or ranged because they have x% concealment. <br><br>Blind fight helps with this in melee. It allows you a reroll on that % chance.<br><br>Syrath

Also Listen is the only skill I can max out because RDD is the only class of mine that has spot as a class skill. Anyways typically peeps have their hide maxed out a lot more than their move silently so it would be better to have a high listen.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 08/16/04 22:05:04 (GMT) -- syrath1001<br><br>Blind fight doesnt help you at all against sneakers, it helps against concealment.

Thank you for setting me straight syrath. In light of this new information it seems blind fight would be a very key feat considering how popular improved invisibility is.<br><br>I think I'm going to get rid of Armor skin since my build already has a high AC and take greater skill focus Listen.
