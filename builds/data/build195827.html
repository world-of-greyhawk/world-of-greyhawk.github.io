<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM or PvP Build</b><br><br>This is an updated version of the original <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "128676", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Irksome Wonder</a>.  His STR is 2 points lower and he doesn't have improved knocdown or the disarm feats, but his fortitude save is 9 points higher and his will save is 2 points higher. With these modifications he can now take it (devastating critical) as well as he can dish it out.  Hopefully this an improvement over one my most popular builds.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br>-With Taunt and Curse Song he can lower an opponents AC by 11 points.  Let's say your playing on one of those servers where enemies have an AC of 100.  With a melee weapon the best AB you can get (STR based) is 80.  You can still only hit on a 20.  If this guy in your party, he can lower that opponents AC by 11, with that 80 you now have a 55% chance to hit on your first attack.<br>-Good AB and Damage per hit.<br>-Use Magic Device of 42 (45).  He can use scrolls and items for other classes.<br>-Immune to Fire.<br>-Devastating Critical with a base DC of 42.<br>-Level 5 Bard Spells.  With his charisma buffed he can cast level 6 spells. <br>-A base fortitude save of 35.  This may seem low relative to most devastating critical DCs, but with resistance bard song, and protection from alignment he can raise that to 38 (40 vs. a chosen alignment) that should be good enough to minimize the risks of being killed. <br>-A will save of 32 vs. spells.  With spell boosts he should be able to save against most mind affecting spells.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br>-Low reflex saves, and no spell defense.  Silence and immunity to fire might help a bit, but it's not a sure thing, and he can't do much against the Bigby's spells (though he should be strong enough to have a chance of making the grapple checks against a multiclassed mage).  <br><br><b>Irksome Wonder V. 2</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Human<br><br><i>Alignment</i> True Neutral<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 16<br>DEX 8<br>CON 15<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 14<br><br><i>Leveling Guide</i><br>Level 1 Bard<br>Level 2 Fighter<br>Level 3 Bard<br>Levels 4-5 Fighter<br>Level 6 Bard<br>Levels 7-8 Fighter<br>Level 9 Bard<br>Levels 10-16 Fighter<br>Levels 17-26 Red Dragon Disciple<br>Levels 27-28 Fighter<br>Levels 29-40 Bard<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Bard 16<br>Fighter 14<br>Red Dragon Disciple 10<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>All 10 go to Strength<br><br><i>Feats</i><br>Level 1: Luck of Heroes, Strong Soul<br>Level 2: Weapon Focus (Greatsword)<br>Level 3: Lingering Song<br>Level 4: Knockdown<br>Level 6: Still Spell<br>Level 7: Weapon Specialization (Greatsword)<br>Level 9: Curse Song<br>Level 10: Improved Critical (Greatsword)<br>Level 12: Power Attack, Skill focus (Taunt)<br>Level 14: Cleave<br>Level 15: Blind Fight<br>Level 16: Great Cleave<br>Level 18: Great Fortitude<br>Level 21: Overwhelming Critical (Greatsword)<br>Level 24: Devastating Critical (Greatsword)<br>Level 27: Epic Weapon Focus (Greatsword)<br>Level 28: Epic Weapon Specialization (Greatsword)<br>Level 30: Epic Skill Focus (Taunt)<br>Level 33: Epic Prowess<br>Level 36: Epic Fortitude<br>Level 39: Great Constitution I<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 34<br>DEX 8  <br>CON 18<br>WIS 8<br>INT 16<br>CHA 16<br><br><i>Final Saves (Vs.

One suggestion:<br><br>If you can squeeze out 3 more skill points (from concentration and discipline maybe) to dump into perform, you could pick up Lasting Inspiration by level 39 at the latest.  That would increase your bard song from 15 rounds to 15 turns (that's assuming lingering song and lasting inspiration stack, otherwise it's 10 turns).  Maybe drop Epic Fortitude...hrm.  Well, I think Lasting Inspiration is worth it, because your 16 bard songs a day will last a very, very long time.<br><br>Steve

I view lasting inspiration as a bit of a double edged sword.  Yes, your bard song lasts very long but so does your curse song.  Curse song inflicts damage on your opponent, so it can be useful to be able to use it multiple times in a single battle.  I remember when I was testing the build I didn't use any magical weapons and I forgot about the Adamantine golem in my training module.  I effectively spammed knockdown to keep it from attacking and used curse song to kill it.  In general, I find I ussually need to rest before I run out bard songs anyway, so it seems to work okay.  Also, If you check the 2da you'll find that you need the level 20 bard song as a pre-requisite feat, so it would take a greater change to accomadate that feat.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

I'm new at this so maybe I'm missing something; but how does your Con go from 15 to 18 if all attr bonuses go to str and only taking greater con once? Build looks sweet although I may use the V1 over 2 since dev crit is banned on the server I play on. I don't think I would need the higher fort as bad. Thanks for posting the builds.<br>_________________<br>Chars:<br>Morfin<br>Wili

It looks like you have only 25 perform, even though you are a level 16 bard you need 30 perform to get the effect of the level 16 bard song (an extra 1 will, 4 hp, 1 AC and 1 to skills compared with level 15).<br><br>Are you relying on an item to boost this? or more likely I have missed something.<br><br>Other than that, it looks good.

Hey no problem, the Bard song requirements are very badly documented.  Someone, somewhere once, managed to get the values from a 2da file I think.  The grimoire seems to have the correct requirements as well.  Glad we could get the build back in tune <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> .
