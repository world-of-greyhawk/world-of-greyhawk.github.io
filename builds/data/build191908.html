<b>Playable from level 1 - 40  ..PvM Build</b><br><br><br>Here's a character I've played / created from level 1 to 40. He's a viking berserker Skald who sings while in a murderous Rage Lol. He gets most epic barb rages and dev crit along with some good bard abilities. Any advice/ pointers on making him better are welcome. I didn't totally min max, but tried to get a pretty good balance of abilities etc.<br>Race	Human			<br>Alignment	Chaotic Neutral			<br>				<br>Starting Stats				<br>Str	14			<br>Dex	14			<br>Con	13			<br>Int	13			<br>Wis	10			<br>Cha	14			<br>Character Level	Class	Skill Increases	Feat Selection	Attribute <br><br>Increase<br>1	Bard:    	Tumble 4 ; Discipline 4; perform 4; spellcraft <br><br>4; umd 4;hide 2;move silent 2; feats curse song,lingering song	<br>2	Barbarian:      Discipline 1, <br><br>3	Bard:	       Discipline 1;lore 6; spellcraft 1;umd 1;tumble 2<br>	<br>4	Barbarian:     Discipline 1; lore 1;Strength +1<br><br>5	Bard:           Discipline 1; heal 1; Lore 1;perform 2 <br><br>;spellcraft 3; Tumble 2 		<br>6	RDD:	       Discipline 1; spell craft 1; weapon focus long <br><br>sword or whatever weapon you want	<br>7	RDD:	       Discipline 1; spell craft 1<br>		<br>8	Bard:	       Discipline 1; heal 2; perform 3; umd 2; tumble 2<br><br>9	Barbarian:      Discipline 1; Intimidate 5; Power atk<br>	<br>10	RDD:            Discipline 1; Spellcraft 3<br>	<br>11	RDD:            Discipline 1; Spellcraft 1<br><br>12	RDD:            Discipline 1; Spellcraft 3; Strength +1; Cleave<br><br>13	RDD:            Discipline 1; Spellcraft 1<br><br>14	RDD:            Discipline 1; Spellcraft 1;search 3<br>	<br>15	RDD:            Discipline 1; Spellcraft 1; Imp Crit long sword<br><br>16	Barbarian:      Discipline 1; Intimidate 5, <br><br>17	Bard:	       Discipline 1; spellcraft 2; Tumble 10 		<br>18	Barbarian:	Discipline 1; Intimidate 4, Knockdown <br>	<br>19	Barbarian:	Discipline 1; Intimidate 1 	<br>20	Bard:    	Discipline 1; heal 1; perform 3; umd 3<br><br>21	RDD:            Discipline 1; Search 2; spellcraft 4; Imp <br><br>knockdown	<br>22	Bard:	        Discipline 1;spellcraft 1;umd 2;tumble 5	<br><br>	<br>23	RDD:             Discipline 1; Spellcraft 1;search 3;spot 4<br><br>24	Barbarian:	Discipline 1; Intimidate 5; Great cleave<br><br>25	Barbarian:	Discipline 1; Intimidate 2<br><br>26	Barbarian:	Discipline 1; Intimidate 2; heal 1;listen 5	<br><br>	<br>27	Bard:     	Discipline 1; move silent 3; perform 3; umd 2; <br><br>tumble 5; overwhelming crit<br>28	Barbarian:	Discipline 1; Intimidate 6; listen 1<br><br>29	Barbarian:	Discipline 1; Intimidate 2<br><br>30	Barbarian:	Discipline 1; Intimidate 1; listen 2;Dev Crit<br><br>31	Barbarian:	Discipline 1; Intimidate 1<br><br>32	Barbarian:	Discipline 1; Intimidate 1; cont +1<br><br>33	Barbarian:	Discipline 1; Intimidate 1; Epic WF<br><br>34	Bard:    	Discipline 1; listen 2; move silent 5; perform <br><br>1; persuade 4; spellcraft 9; umd 6; tumble 7		<br>35	Barbarian:	Discipline 1; Intimidate 2<br><br>36	Barbarian:	Discipline 1; Intimidate 1;Cont +1; Terrifying <br><br>Rage<br>37	Bard:    	Discipline 1; listen 2;move silent 5; perform 1 <br><br>;persuade 1; spellcraft 5; tumble 3		<br>38	Barbarian:	Discipline 1; Intimidate 2;listen 2<br><br>39	Barbarian:	Discipline 1; Intimidate 1; listen 2; <br><br>Thundering Rage<br>40	Bard:     	Discipline 1;move silent 5;perform 1; pick <br><br>pocket 5; umd 5; Int +1<br><br>Level Distribution				<br>Bard	       11			<br>Barbarian      19			<br>RDD            10			<br>Final Skills				<br>Discipline	43			<br>Intimidate	42			<br>spellcraft      40			<br>Tumble	        40			<br>UMD     	25			<br>Perform  	18 *Plus an assortment of other various skills<br>Final Stats	<br>Str	30<br>Dex	14<br>Con	20<br>Int	18<br>Wis	10<br>Cha	18<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick.

I don't get the mid life charisma crisis.. why 18 and not 16? 18 doesn't REALLY give you much more if anything..<br><br>-DaMouse

Well from a quick skim over it I saw Charisma starting at 14 and charisma ending at 18 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>-DaMouse

12barb/4bard/4RDD for max pre epic BAB.<br><br>reduce charisma to 14 and don't raise any stats here.<br><br>Take 12bard/18barb/10rdd for a few more spells.<br><br>That is what I would do <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

My GOD that's difficult to read. I *think* you've missed a feat at level 3, but I could be wrong, it's not easy to tell with that layout tbh.<br><br>I'd agree with most of Kalmar's suggestions, and also take Heavy Armour proficiency. This would allow you to drop Dex to 10. I'd also drop Wis to 8, and use the stat points to start Con at 16 and Int at 14. More hitpoints and more skills are always great for builds like this.<br><br>Plus, you'd then be ending with 22 Con, so if you were playing where Dev Crit is banned, you could (theoretically) take the Epic DR feats instead. If there was no Dev Crit, I'd also drop Power Attack, Cleave and Great Cleave for Blind Fight, Expertise and Improved Knockdown. That would save an epic feat (level 21) that could be spent on an ability increase, freeing up a feat later on for the third Epic DR feat.<br><br>I'd go for Bard 8 / RDD 8 / Barbarian 4 pre-epic, as that gives you an easier time of it levelling up than Kalmar's way, and also gets you better saving throws.

I actually was going to ask if someone could help me find a way to get the epic dr feats into this build. I went dev crit route simply due to the easily reaching the strength requirement. On a crit this character can do some pretty good added damage even if the enemy saves versus dev. He does extra damage due to both overwhelming crit, and thundering rage, which I believe adds 2d6 damage plus can deafen.<br><br>     Again, i appreciate all suggestions. I'm pretty good with coming up for a character theme or idea, but not the best builder to bring them to life.
