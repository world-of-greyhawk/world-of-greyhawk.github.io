The Supporting Act<br>Bard (Level 30), Arcane Archer (Level 9), Rogue (Level 1)<br>Elf, Chaotic Good<br>&lt;PvM&gt;<br>This is roughly the character i used to play on a nordock server called Tyorell, he wasnt very easy to play alone,but was a great boon for any party to take, especially for meleers. I had a lot of fun playing him, but wasnt very aware of building at the time, i just loved being a jack of all trades. If theres any major flaws or room for improvements feel free to point them out as i tend to carry him whatever server i go.<br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 16 ( 22 )<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 16 ( 24 )<br><br>Hitpoints: 289 maximum rolls<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Reflex/Will):  21 / 30 /19<br>Saving Throw bonuses: With Bard Song:  23 / 32 / 22<br>BAB:  27 ( i think :S )<br>AB: 41/36/31/26  with normal longbow ( +2 AB and +3 Bludgeoning damage with bard song ) +5 arrows, +1D6 Sneak attack<br>AC : 26 Naked ( 31 Naked and Bardsong )<br><br>LEVELING GUIDE<br>01: Bard : Extra Music<br>02: Bard<br>03: Bard : Weapon Focus:Longbow<br>04: Bard : CHA+1<br>05:Bard<br>06:Bard : Point Blank Shot<br>07:Bard<br>08:Bard: CHA +1<br>09:Bard : Curse Song<br>10: Bard<br>11:Bard<br>12Bard: Improved Critical Longbow : CHA +1<br>13: AA : Enchant Arrow I<br>14: AA<br>15: AA : Extend Spell : Enchant ArrowII<br>16: AA: CHA+1 : Exploding Arrows<br>17: AA : Enchant Arrow : III<br>18: AA : Rapid Shot<br>19: AA : Enchant Arrow IV<br>20: AA : DEX+1<br>21: AA : Epic Weapon Focus : Longbow : Enchant Arrow V<br>22: Bard<br>23: Bard<br>24:Bard: Armour Skin : DEX+1<br>25:Bard<br>26:Bard<br>27:Bard: Epic Prowess<br>28:Bard : CHA+1<br>29:Bard <br>30: Bard : Lasting Inspiration<br>31: Bard<br>32: Bard: Epic Skill Focus ~ Perform : CHA+1<br>33:Bard: Great Charisma I<br>34: Bard<br>35: Bard: Great Charisma II<br>36:Bard: Great Dexterity I : DEX+1<br>37:  Bard<br>38: Bard : Great Dexterity II<br>39: Bard : Called Shot<br>40: Rogue : Sneak Attack +1D6<br>(I only took rogue as i love skill points and i thought the sneak attack would boost my low damage a little, <br>taking fighter at 40 offers a bonus feat.)<br><br>Skills Progression: <br>24 At start went:<br>4 in Discipline, Lore, Perfom, Spellcraft, Tumble and Use Magic Device.<br>Levels 1-12 (bard): 1 Point in each of above (at levels 6-12 i substitued the point in lore for pickpocket)<br>13: 3 in open lock ( always helped for indestructable chests )<br>14: 3 in hide 3 in move silently<br>15-21: 3 in listen 3 in spot <br>22: 6 in perform<br>23: 5 in perfom, 1 in tumble<br>24-25: 1 in perform, 5 in tumble<br>26: 1 in perform, 3 in tumble, 2 in discipline<br>27-30: 1 in perfom, 1 in tumble, 4 in discipline<br>31-39: 1 in perform, 1 in tumble, 1 in discipline, 3 in spellcraft.<br>40:1 in tumble, 5 in disarm trap, 2 in open lock, 2 in set trap.<br><br>Final Skill Points with bard song (increase of 9):<br>Disarm trap: 16<br>Discipline: 51<br>Hide: 18<br>Listen: 31<br>Lore: 49<br>Open Lock: 20<br>Perform: 68<br>Pickpocket: 22<br>Set trap: 19<br>Spellcraft: 53<br>Spot: 31<br>Tumble: 58<br>Use magic Device: 31<br><br>PVPwise he was TERRIBLE against casters, usually 1 or 2 empowered missile storms would kill him but,<br>with his almighty curse song, high AC, dirge, extended imp invisiblity for 50% concealment, <br>and called shot on leg, kiting melee players was much fun.

Well, I see a Bard alright, bu it's not very proficient in either melee or ranged. I don't see why you need so many Bard levels, personally I believe that it's very useless to keep advancing Bard into epics, more Arcane Archer levels would really help the damage and AB. With the low STR your melee will deal less damage than the arrows and aside from a few spells that won't become stronger with epic bard levels, you need to deal more damage. I would easily drop 10 to 14 Bard levels.<br><br>I must also agree with avado, why Rogue? it seems very pointless.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 05/09/08 07:26 (GMT) -- avado<br><br>THax, you know i love and respect you, right?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

I was usually teamed up with a melee fighter who i would keeped buffed up, the 30 lvls of bard was because the server buffed bardsong at lvl 30 ( 100 perform i think, stormnexus does it aswell off the top of my head )<br>I only took last level in rogue to get the extra D6 of damage as i wouldnt be 'tanking', and didnt buff his open lock etc as end bardsong ( fully geared up at 40) 'usually' compensated. yeah he totally sucked solo no argument there <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  i'll try dropping 14 or so bard levels for AA next time

I agree about the 1 lvl rogue being unnecessary. But I disagree about slamming bard. Lasting Inspiration is always a nice trick to have. And since the requirements for that mandate at least 1 bardic level in epic, and bard is his way of getting tumble &amp; discipline besides, I really don't think you could justify dropping bard below 16 at least and probably 20. But that said, bard 21/AA 19 wouldn't be a bad split either.
