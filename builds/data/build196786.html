<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>This is a variant to the Avenging Commando.  I cannot decide which I like better, although this one avoids the experience penalty and has significantly better saves, only marginally worse attack bonus.<br><br>Avenging Champion Commando<br><br>Overview<br><br>Paladin: 15<br>Champion of Torm: 8<br>Rogue: 17<br><br>Race: Any but Half-Orc or Dwarf <br>Alignment: Lawful Good<br><br>Starting Stats<br>Str: 14<br>Dex: 10<br>Con: 12<br>Int: 14<br>Wis: 14<br>Cha: 14 <br><br>Final Stats<br>Str: 26<br>Dex: 10<br>Con: 12<br>Int: 14<br>Wis: 14<br>Cha: 18 <br><br>Final Skills<br>Disable Trap: 20+<br>Open Lock: 20+<br>Search: 20+<br>Spot: 20+<br>Listen: 20+<br>Craft Trap: 20+<br>Discipline: 20+<br>Hide: 20+<br>Move Silently: 20+<br>Set Trap: 20+<br>Spellcraft: 20+<br>Tumble: 40+<br>Use Magic Devices: 43 <br><br>You can scrap spellcraft and take taunt to 40.  Or be human and take taunt to 40.  It is a versatile build on the skill side.  Not much versatility on the feat side,though.<br><br>If you go human, you can add 40 skill points and one feat. I go elf.  I like greatswords but you can use any weapon, preferably with a high critical threat range.  Scimitar or longsword with a shield would add nice ac.  Not enough feats to go for two-weapon fighting.<br><br>Equipment<br>Full Plate<br>Greatsword<br>Trap Kits <br><br>AVENGING CHAMPION COMMANDO ADVANTAGES<br><br>• High Use Magic Device. Like MacGuyver or any good marine, the Avenging Commando can improvise, adapt, and overcome. This gives huge versatility to the character, particularly if uses his rogue abilities to scout out a situation.<br>• Devastating Critical. As a warrior against the forces of evil, the Avenging Commando has become a master swordsman, capable of killing an opponent with one blow. <br>• Can use the best armor in the game without concern for spell failure (only casts from items and scrolls) or class/alignment restriction (use magic device). <br>• 10D6 Sneak Attack. Evil must fall, and swiftly. Augments his already potent critical attack with sneak attacks for distracted or unsuspecting opponents. <br>• Level 4 Paladin Spells. Including Holy Avenger, Greater Magic Weapon, Bull Strength, Prayer, Protection from Evil.<br>• Can set and craft traps. <br>• Better saves. Divine Grace adds the charisma bonus to all saves. +4 for 8 CoT levels. +4 to saves against spells due to spellcraft.<br>• Improved Evasion. The Avenging Commando will either take half damage or no damage against damage spells.<br>• Immune to fear and disease. <br>• Smite evil six times a day (paladin, CoT, Extra Smiting)<br>• Cure disease.<br>• Lay on hands x2.<br>• Turn and destroy undead.<br>• Divine Wrath -- add +3 to attack, damage, and AC for four rounds.<br>• Decent AB for a character with rogue abilities: BAB OF 28, 36 after strength bonus applied, with four attacks per round. Using greatsword, this jumps to 39.<br><br>AVENGING CHAMPION COMMANDO DISADVANTAGES<br><br>• Low Hitpoints. Very low for a melee character. Need boots of striding. <br><br>FAVORED SPELLS:<br><br>• Level 1: Bless, Protection From Alignment, Sanctuary, <br>• Level 2: Bull's Strength, Endurance <br>• Level 3: Greater Magic Weapon <br>• Level 4: Holy Avenger <br><br>MAGIC ITEM WISH LIST:<br><br>• An item with haste or scrolls of haste. <br>• A powerful greatsword, preferably keen. With greater magic weapon and holy avenger, he can turn a normal greatsword into a powerful weapon, but some extra power is always useful. <br>• HP boosting items. To address his low HP. <br><br>Key Stats<br><br>Final Saves (Vs. Spells)<br>• Fortitude 30 (35) <br>• Reflexes 30 (34) <br>• Will 26 (30) <br>AB and Damage<br>• With no buffs, regular greatsword:<br>39/34/29/24 18+2D6 (+10D6 Sneak Attack) (17-20 x2)<br>Devastating Critical DC 38 <br>• Holy Avenger, Greater Magic Weapon, Bull's Strength.

three more things about this build that I like:<br><br>1. you have 14 intelligence and 14 wisdom, meaning you have both intelligence and insight in your conversation choices.  PvM concern, I suppose, but even in the abstract I like being wise and smart.<br><br>2. it is playable from 1 to 40, really and truly.  No waiting for the build to materialize.<br><br>3.  a lot of flexibility is built into the build.  You can play it elf as noted and still adjust feats and skills.  Humans get an extra feat and 40 extra skill points.  So anyone else's commando won't look exactly like everyone else's but will still kick @$$.<br>_________________<br>We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender - Winston Churchill

One note on smite evil.  For whatever reason, you get one smite evil even if you are a paladin AND a champion of Torm.  So extra smiting gets you three, not six, smites.  Does not seem right or just, but I have confirmed it in gameplay.  Still probably worth taking the extra smiting feat but it makes knockdown look like a pretty good option,too.<br>_________________<br>We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender - Winston Churchill

I don't generally bother carefully looking over all the feats unless it's something that looks complicated to actually build...<br><br><br>Anyway, one thing I did just notice as I was looking at that problem...on the same level as the second epic prowess, you take Epic Skill Focus: Tumble as a rogue bonus feat.  I'm not sure I see any reason for that.  It doesn't give you any extra AC, and the DC for tumble checks is a flat 15, so you already have way more tumble than you would ever need to never fail a tumble check (unless it's auto-fail on a 1, in which case the Skill Focus still wouldn't help you).  I think Crippling Strike would be more worthwhile choice.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 06/03/05 07:35</span></i></p>

Thanks for the input.  Yup, you need Great Strength VI and you don't need (and cannot have) epic prowess twice.  I like epic skill focus, but (Steve) you are right on that, too.  <br><br>I have this build at level 40 on one PW (Godspire) and at level 10 in another (Badlands).  It is fun from level one.<br>_________________<br>We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender - Winston Churchill

All right, I have taken this to Level 13 on Badlands PW.<br><br>It strikes me that you probably want to add knockdown to the build.  But where: Extra Smiting, Great Cleave, or Blind Fight?<br><br>Extra Smiting is the easiest to cut, particularly since you only get three despite having CoT and Paladin smithing.<br><br>Then what about Improved Knockdown?  Yup, and how?  At Great Cleave.  <br><br>Why Knockdown?  To increase the opportunities for sneak attacks.  This build gives lots of bonus damage, both from crits (15-20 with a keen weapon) and sneak attacks.  <br><br>Gotta keep blind fight as long as you are in a PvP environment, near as I can tell.<br><br><br>So there.  It's a massively fun PC to play so far and I have just got my first paladin buff (prot from evil).  aaah.<br>_________________<br>We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender - Winston Churchill

In epic levels that represents one, perhaps 2 hits. If the 40 HPs is going to make that much of a difference in battle, then you've got bigger problems. You should have access to Endurance potions by that time anyway, so just slurp one of them back and you have 40 or 80 extra HPs right there.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
