Most Liches start their lives as wizards who, in an effort to cheat death, cast off their mortal flesh and embrace the power of death. Free from the inhibitions of the living (hunger, thirst, fatigue, death) they can carry out their research and achieve greater leaves of power. Liches who achieve great power through armies of the dead and by wielding great magics are known as Lich Kings. Liches who were once clerics but have given into the power of darkness are called Unholy Lich Kings. However those rare Liches who were once clerics in life, yet retain their good nature and have achieved great power are known as Holy Lich Kings.<br><br>Advantages<br>The Holy Lich King has a vast knowledge of buffing spells and thanks to his high wisdom he may cast a vast number of spells per day. His wisdom also increases his AC, due to the feat ‘Monk’s Armour’ and his to hit, due to the feat ‘Intuitive Attack’. Along with his spell immunity and damage reduction this makes the Holy Lich King very hard to injure.<br><br>When buffed up the Holy Lich King’s naked AC rises to 55; his to hit becomes +55/ +52/ +49/ +46/ +43; his damage is 1-8 +6, +2 magical damage and his saves are fortitude =36, reflex =29, will =48.<br><br>Weaknesses<br>Low attack damage and 1 in 10 chance of a critical hit make an unbuffed Lich very weak in melee combat. Only knows a few offensive spells.<br><br>Statistics<br>Race: Yuan ti<br>Alignment: Lawful good<br>Cleric 21 / Monk 9 / Lich 10<br>Cleric domains: war and darkness <br><br>Start: WIS =10, Dex=16, Con=14, In=16, Wis=26, Cha=14<br>End: WIS =10, Dex=16, Con=26, In=26, Wis=48, Cha=24<br><br>Attack +44/ +41/ +38/ +35, damage 1-8, critical 19-20/ x2 (unarmed)<br>AC 44 (naked)<br>HP 586<br>Spell resistance 37<br>Saves: fortitude =30, reflex =21, will =41<br><br>Holy Lich King<br>Level	Modification<br>1 (CLERIC)	Feat: Intuitive attack<br>Skills: spell craft +4, concentration +4, 5<br>2 (MONK)	Skills: discipline +5, jump +5, Tumble +5<br>3 (CLERIC)	Feat: Craft wondrous item<br>Skills: spell craft +2, concentration +2, <br>4 (CLERIC)	Stat: WIS +1<br>Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>5 (CLERIC)	Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>6 (CLERIC)	Feat: Weapon focus (unarmed)<br>Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>7 (CLERIC)	Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>8 (CLERIC)	Stat: WIS +1<br>Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>9 (CLERIC)	Feat: Improved critical (unarmed)<br>Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>10 (CLERIC)	Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>11 (CLERIC)	Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>12 (CLERIC)	Feat: Combat casting<br>Stat: WIS +1<br>Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>13 (LICH)	* Change alignment *<br>Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>14 (MONK)	Skills: discipline +12, jump +12, tumble +12<br>15 (LICH)	Feat: Extend spell<br>Skills: spell craft +2, concentration +1, <br>16 (MONK)	Stat: WIS +1<br>Skills: discipline +2, jump +2, tumble +2, <br>17 (LICH)	Skills: spell craft +2, concentration +3<br>18 (LICH)	Feat: Circle kick<br>Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>19 (CLERIC)	Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>20 (CLERIC)	Stat: WIS +1<br>Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>21 (CLERIC)	Feat: Epic weapon focus<br>Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>22 (CLERIC)	Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>23 (CLERIC)	Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>24 (CLERIC)	Feat: Improved combat casting<br>Stat: WIS +1<br>Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>25 (CLERIC)	Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>26 (CLERIC)	Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>27 (CLERIC)	Feat: Practised spellcaster (Cleric)<br>Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>28 (CLERIC)	Stat: WIS +1<br>Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>29 (LICH)	Skills: spell craft +1, concentration +1, <br>30 (MONK)	Feat: Toughness<br>Skills: discipline +14, jump +14, tumble +14<br>31 (LICH)	Skills: spell craft +2, concentration +2<br>32 (MONK)	Stat: WIS +1<br>Skills: discipline +2, jump +2,  Tumble +2<br>33 (LICH)	Feat: Armour skin<br>Skills: spell craft +2, concentration +2<br>34 (MONK)	Skills: discipline +2, jump +2, Tumble +2<br>35 (LICH)	Skills: spell craft +2, concentration +2<br>36 (MONK)	Feat: Great wisdom +1<br>Stat: WIS +1<br>Skills: discipline +2, jump +1, Tumble +2<br>37 (LICH)	Skills: spell craft +2, concentration +2<br>38 (MONK)	Skills: discipline +2, Tumble +2<br>39 (LICH)	Feat: Great wisdom +1<br>Skills: spell craft +2, concentration +2<br>40 (MONK)	* Change alignment *<br>Stat: WIS +1<br>Skills: discipline +2, Tumble +2<br><br>NB I have not added the amount of skills points you need to save because when the Lich gains levels the character’s intellect and skill points should increase (currently they do not), thus in an updated version how many skill points you need to save may alter.

Its a pity they can't increase skill points in the same way that a 'Red Dragon Disiple' class increases them.<br>_________________<br>Who really controls the Iron Throne?
