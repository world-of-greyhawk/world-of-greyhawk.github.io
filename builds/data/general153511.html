Thanks man, helpful info. <br><br>I also saw I made a mistake in my post, using 16 pm levels.

Nice page-long quote there Anuis <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br>Evocation will lose you conjuration, which is considerably more useful than Enchantment. Choosing a spell school doesn't (to my understanding) make you any better at it, just gives you one more spell slot/spell level, so might as well take illusion and use a useless school.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

I was in hurry, didn't think about it at that time.<br><br>But if you did evocation instead, you would be able to use it more and especially since there are some powerful spells in that school.<br><br>But if they just give you one extra slot... might as well go generalist. Then do a spell focus(and up to epic) in Evocation, Necromacy, or Illusion or do combination of two. You will have higher DC saves for the spells in that school. But the way this build is built, you might only can do one type of school spell focus. So either it is Evocation or Illusion, I would go for Evocation since you can use powerful spells. But if you don't want to do that, do Abjuration, they give you nice defenses and spells that can strip caster of their defenses especially monks with SR(Mordenkainen's Disjunction). But again, if you don't want to do any of those, use Illusion since they have both combination of defensive and offensive spells.<br><br>Anuis

This is to Anuis' post:<br>With generalist you dont get the extra spell slot per level. With evocation or illusion you would get the exact same bonus: an extra spell slot per level (for any spell from any spell school: "A wizard who chooses to specialize in a school of magic gains one additional prepared spell per level but loses the ability to cast spells from one other school"), with different drawbacks. <br>The drawback from illusion is insignificant, whereas with evocation you'd lose your conjuration spells, some of which are quite useful. Enchantment spells... aren't (arguably, I guess). Choosing a school of magic isn't the same as choosing a spell focus. It doesn't affect anything other than that it gives you a free spell slot and you lose access to another school.<br>With wizard an extra spell slot/level is invaluable.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?
