I know, it's a noobie question, but I am curious to find out what good it does for the char.

Improved initiative gives you a bonus on your initiative roll.<br><br>First part of any combat is the initiative roll. The person that gets initiative gets to attack first.<br><br>Fighter A has initiative bonus of +10 and 4 attacks per round.<br><br>Fighter B has initiative bonus of +2 and 3 attacks per round.<br><br>Fighter A rolls 1d20 and gets 15(+10)=25. Fighter B rolls 1d20 and gets 10(+2)=12. <br><br>Each round is divided into 3 flurries. Fighter A (4 attacks) gets 2 in the first flurry, 1 in the 2nd and 1 in the 3rd. Fighter B gets 1 attack in each.<br><br>Now the order of events.<br><br>Flurry 1 Fighter A gets his 2 attacks before Fighter B gets his 1 attack. Fighter is B is considered flatfooted.<br><br>Flurry 2 Fighter A gets 1 attack. Fighter B gets 1 attack.<br><br>Flurry 3 Fighter A gets 1 attack. Fighter B gets 1 attack.<br><br>In a close and tight fighter the person attacking first has the clear advantage. If that fighter also has sneak attack he gets to land 2 sneak attacks before the second fighter can react.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!
