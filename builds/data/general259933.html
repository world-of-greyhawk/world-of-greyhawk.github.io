I've finally downloaded the Novice to Epic Character Maker. It is very crack like in its addiction factor <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I've been creating characters of the Monk/Rogue/Fighter persuasion and I can't seem to get the extra attack by including 4 levels of fighter in the first 20 levels. It is just 4 levels right?<br><br>Also what does the CEP in the Novice to Epic Character Maker CEP edition stand for? Do I already have CEP if I bought the Diamond Edition?

It's not just the 4 full BAB class lvls, in your case you must take monk and rogue in multiples of 4 preepic too. So for example FTR 4/Rogue 4/Monk 12.<br><br>Check <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?forum=58&amp;topic=407381" target="_blank">this guide</a> out too, to get a picture of how BAB works.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!

Thanks Kail, but I'm still a bit confused. The link you posted doesn't mention the multiples of 4 rule and it suggests that you need 6 levels of group 1 to get that extra attack.<br><br>I'm not questioning your answer I just don't see what you are pointing to in the link. I'll keep my levels to groups of four and see how that plays out. Thanks again.<br><br>Hmm with all the info you guys have been giving me I should try to post a build soon <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">

Okay, you seem to fail to grasp the idea of BAB at the moment.  Base Attack Bonus of BAB raises a certain number depending on what class you take.  The types of progressions are 1 BAB/1 level, 3 BAB/ 4 levels, or 1 BAB/ 2 levels.  To maximize BAB gain from a type 2 (3/4) class, you have to take the full 4 levels, thus the rule of 4.<br><br>There are certain points where you get an extra attack based on how much BAB you have.  At BAB 6, you get an extra attack, BAB 11, you get another, and at BAB 16 you get your third extra attack.  Something you seem to be missing is: <b>A CERTAIN NUMBER OF LEVELS IN ANY GIVEN CLASS DOES NOT GRANT EXTRA ATTACKS, IT IS BASED SOLELY ON BAB.</b>  Thus, 4 or 6 levels of fighter does not mean you get an extra attack, per say, but it does give a corresponding BAB bonus.<br><br>Now, then... You original question is based around BAB.  A straight Monk or Rogue has a BAB of 15 at level 20.  By trading out 4 levels of either for a 1:1 class like fighter you can get a 16 BAB which gives the extra attack.<br><br>Note that this only works pre-epic (AKA before level 20)

The multiples of 4 are based on the following:<br><br>A full BAB class gets +1 BAB per level at any level.<br><br>A medium BAB class (is it called like that?) such as monk, cleric, rogue, bard, assassin, druid and shadowdancer (hope I didn't miss any), get less BAB, see the BAB table in the manual for the exact points, the thing is, a medium BAB class will <b>not</b> increase BAB at <b>class level</b> 1, 5, 9, 13 and 17, thus, if you keep the class level (and not the overall level of course) in multiples of 4 you'll exit the class progress before the level in which it won't increase, effectively covering BAB at max for that class, at which point only 4 levels of a full BAB class will suffice for 16 BAB and 4 APR. This also makes you need to get up to level 20 for the last APR.<br><br>On another way to see it, you will get 3 BAB for every 4 levels wih those classes (keep in mind 5 levels are also 3 BAB), so if you aim at 4 fighter levels you need 16 medium BAB class levels at exact multiples of 4 to reach the needed 12 which will get to 16 adding the 4 of Fighter.<br><br>Hope that made sense.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/05/06 03:22</span></i></p>

What I do is take 4 Fighter levels after 16th level.<br><br>Level 17<br>Level 18<br>Level 19<br>Level 20<br><br>And I always get my 4th attack. I don't ask questions.

Sure, something like Monk 9 / Bard 7 / Fighter 4 (Bard and Monk as any other med-BAB growth class which I listed) would get a BAB of 15 (3 APR), since Monk and Bard are not in multiples of 4.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/12/06 01:29</span></i></p>
