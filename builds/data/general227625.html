Hello,<br><br>I want to play a spellsword on a persistant world (you probably have seen my latest design in the Epic Character Builds Thread) und would like to ask for your help in choosing a spell school.<br>Illusion seems the best choice if you only think about solo-play, but mass-haste may be sorely missing in a party.<br>What would you choose and why?<br><br>Many thanx in advance

General.<br><br>No one has ever made a satisfactory argument to me for choosing a school.  You said it yourself, choosing one school LIMITS what you can do.  As a spellsword your STRENGTHS come from having alot of tricks up your sleeves.  Otherwise, you arent as useful as you could be.<br><br>Just my 2 cents.

The argument for choosing one is an extra spell per level.<br>Especially for low-stat caster very interesting IMHO ...

i wouldnt worry about being the only wiz in the party.<br>although it is highly likely that everyone else will also be an illusionist.

If you select Necromancy as your school, you have to remember that you will not be able to cast True Sight or See Invisibility.  If you can't see your opponent, you'll have a hard time.
