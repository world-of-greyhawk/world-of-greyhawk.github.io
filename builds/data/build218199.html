<b>Playable 1 to 40, PvM.</b><br><br>"Grandfather" the young boy stated "what is that old fortress there?" the boy pointed towards the small and old fortress standing on the top a hill in  the thick forest. It still seemed quite solid, just that it was..... neglected.<br>"That fortress belonged to the old lord of these lands. He was Dwarf who mostly dwelled in these here forests." the old man told his grandson."That fortress was built when I was a kid, when the Dwarf had been touched by the gods of good. At first he was a ranger of the land, then he felt his call to become Paladin." The teenager looked at him, intrigued. His grandfather continued; "He built that fortress to serve as his home, and for protection to the surrounding lands." "He died?" the boy wanted to know. "Patience lad. Listen. For it is a strange tale indeed. Of courage and true care. Of darkness corrupting a stout heart. You are old enough to learn this now." A strange emotion crossed the old man's face. One his grandson couldn't interpret.<br><br>-----------<br>The Baron who owned this land had a black heart. He only cared to satisfy his own greed, and cared nothing for the people, not like the dwarflord. He wasn't really a lord, but had taken this peole under his wings. The Baron raised taxes on a regular basis, keeping his people starving almost to death. They in turn had no choice but to plan a rebellion. when he heard of this, he sent his best men to deal with the rebels. The Dwarflord stood up to those men, but both he and his brave and poor men were viciously cut down. The Dwarflord for some reason survived. He realized that night that his god-given powers weren't enough, and no matter how hard he prayed, no God answered. Not his God anyway. The God of Vengeance heard his call, and the desperate Dwarf struck a deal.<br><br>The Dwarf was given great strength, and he received two companions for him to command. One undead and one devil. He also got the gift to step from shadow to shadow. And even to slip from view, wrapping himself in the shadows. As a return, he would abandon his former god and Serve the God of vengeance for the rest of his life.<br><br>The following nights money and food disappeared everywhere, and the people of the land found money and food on their doorsteps. The Baron was so furious he sent large forces out to search for the thief, just like the Dwarflord wanted. The morning after they found the Baron dead in his bed. His heart ripped out of his chest. Rumors say the Dwarflord ate it.The barons family, even his two kids, were dead as well. As was his bodyguards and advisors. Such ended the Baron's tyranny.<br>---------<br><br>"Wow, grandpa, what happened then?"<br>"Oh, the Dwarflord took all the riches to his fortress, giving it out to his people in portions. They say he still has great riches stored there, but he has never used his keep after he abandoned his God."<br><br>"What happened to the Dwarflord? How did he end his days?" the lad wanted to know.<br>"Oh, he is alive. He is an old Dwarf, but still very much capable. He still protects these lands. Bandits are lured by the riches in his keep. Many has entered, but none has ever been seen again.<br>Sometimes one can see the old Dwarf and his bear in the forests that surrounds us. I don't care if he eats his enemies hearts, or that he kills everyone trying to get his treasure. He is the best thing ever to happen in these lands."<br><br>The two wandered away, still chattering. A dwarf suddenly appeared from under a nearby tree. His back was broad, and his arms were strong still. He had gray, almost silver hair and beard. He had many scars from numerous battles, and wrinkled skin showing signs of an advanced age. By his side was an old bear. "You are mostly right, old man" the Dwarf whispered. "Except for the riches. They are long gone, returned to the poor." He continued to whisper to himself. " But the rumor lives on, luring bandits and greedy adventurers my way. To end their miserable existence."<br><br>"Come Brumbar" He said aloud to his bear. Both stretching their old bodies, a creaking sound from the joints could be heard. "The shadows are long this evening, and perhaps there is a bandits heart or two to be had." A wicked grin showing off his face, he wandered into the forest again.<br>_______<br><br>When 1st ed AD&amp;D came out, I started playing Dwarven ranger, my favorite since. Then 3rd ed arrived, bringing with it the Blackguard. That was my first character there, and many since even in NwN. Never have I used the two together though. About time.

I am honored to be the wellspring from which you flow.  Well done, and captivating story as well.  Grim, I think you are the only one with enough balls to make Dwarven Blackguards.  Bravo!  The Con's a little disappointing, but there's not much you can do there unless you abandon Shadowdancer altogether and start with a 10 Dex and move Con to 14, and then open up room for feats like Toughness and Improved Crit.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Thank you. I missed imp crit in the build, but switching to rogue instead of SD will get you Imp Crit and toughness in place of dodge and mobility like you say, for 120 more hp's.<br>It might even be valid to lower CHA and raise INT by 2 points for another 43 skillpoints even. In spellcraft perhaps. Actually, you wouldn't have to x-class tumble either.<br><br>I am sure there are more people than Grizz who has opinions on my Dwarven Ranger/Blackie. Come on.....

Ranger/Blackguard/Monk would net you a free Cleave + Evasion. That means you gain 3 feats compared to the Shadowdancer version (Cleave for free and you can drop Dodge/Mobility).<br>_________________<br>Now is my day's work done;<br>I'll take good breath:<br>Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of<br>blood and death.

Nice build, blackguard and ranger together <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br>I'd cheese it with rogue rather then SD.

I'd adjust SD to rogue only depending on environment.  If you'll get a lot of magic items, UMD is more viable.  If you won't, HIPS is an excellent power and allows you to get off reliable blackguard sneak attacks for bonus damage.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Monk gives you Evasion and Cleave on level one but I think you still need to take Power Attack to qualify for Blackguard. It's still one feat more.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:. Only those who have known darkness in<br>(OvO) their hearts will see the shadows in life...<br>(|__|)<br>..".."..

The point is that the monk lvl would be the cheesy lvl to bump up tumble so that he cannot take it before blackguard to meet the requirements. Therefore he has to take cleave anyhow (and power attack to qualify for it), even if monk would grant it for free much later in his career (37th lvl).<br><br>Cheers<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/30/05 00:16</span></i></p>

i have never used monk for cheese in a build without planning on taking it to monk 6. I mean c'mon, that should be the bare minimum for monk cheese levels for a melee build. dont you think? I know it's the old cheese vs. style point, but I just prefer getting as most out of each class i m/c with that i can while not giving up what i really want. heh, my latest example? Sorc 30/Monk 6/Pally 4. monk 6 mainly for monk speed, plus it gives me a few opportunities to take skill dumps. I took pally 4 because I figured what the hell, lets make a caster sorc use DIVINE SHIELD. haha. really though, essentially you get a constant 13 or higher bonus to AC all the time, you just have to take time to cast it. If you told most mages if they would like, say, 16 casts per day of a spell that gives them a 15 ac bonus for a turn and a half, i think they'd all droll. Of course you gotta blow two feats and lower your stats to get 15 str, but hey.<br><br>I like the ranger BG combo. I think there is a nice synergy there, though I'd maybe consider taking 6 levels of DwD for obvious reasons. You know, it really is going to be okay if your build *GASP* dosen't have tumble.<br>_________________<br>"I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.

What's the obvious reason? Not 3 DR, so it has to be def stance which is not that useful. Instead of HipS.... But where do you think the levels should go? You would lose feats for certain. Featwise, you can remove from BG and only lose you one epic feat, since SD and DD requires two feats. That would make BG more or less out of it which is weird for a fallen Paladin. If you take from Ranger, remember that the first four levels you remove will cost three feats.<br>Well. As i said, 1 level to spare, this is a ranger/BG.
