With a crash and grind of metal the General, clad head to toe in blackened metal, dismounted his massive warhorse and bellowed.  "I will face any of your army, one on one.  The loser leaves to field and forfeits their claims to this land".  Silence descended upon the field, "Is there no one wh..."  With a murmer and a rattle of armor the wall of men before him parted to let through a slight wirey man, dressed in only a plain looking robe and holding a simple spear.  The General laughed out loud, "Is this the best you people have to offer...so be it then."  With a snarl he began to move steadily towards his opponent, who closed his eyes and began to pray.  "Your gods cannot help you now fool," he said.  Suddenly the man stopped praying, the general looked closer at the man and saw an aura surrounding him, the spear in his grasp pulsed with energy and it's point was aflame.  "I beg to differ," said the spearman, adding one more chant and promptly vanishing into thin air.  "What manner of trickery is...where is he?"  A flicker caught his eye and suddenly the spearman was in front of him.  Swinging at the half-visible opponent he growled in frustration and then suddenly stopped and looked down at his chest.  He howled in pain as he saw a spear sticking out of it before falling face first into the dirt.  Blackness and death descended upon the General, and then suddenly he was standing uninjured.  He looked to his chest and saw only a hole in his armor, "Wh..wh..what?" he stuttered.  Looking up he stared straight into the eyes of the spearman.  "This is not your Land, leave now or next time I will leave your soul to pass on."  The General's eyes grew larger as he realised what had just happened, stumbling quickly to his horse he galloped off to his army.<br><br><br>I apologise for the cheesy story (boring day at work) and the fact that this build (or something similar) has probably been done before (but that hasn't stopped the gazillion bard/rdd/wm builds, so there <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    ).  Basically I was reading The Wheel of Time and thought about doing a kind of Aiel/Channeler cross and this is what I came up with.  With buffs and things it can get pretty good AC and AB (might calculate them if I get REALLY bored) and it's damage output is pretty darn good.  Has a full complement of cleric spells and some monk/WM goodies.  For domains I build it with war and trickery but the choice is yours.  It's a bit of a munchkin I guess but I'm having fun with him on the PW I play.

Nice build. I would probably start with Cleric(10)/Monk(4)/WM(6) instead Cleric(11)/Monk(4)/WM(5) for a +1 to all saving throws.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.Detail&amp;id=856" target="_blank">Character Build Calculator</a>(works with Excel, Open Office) 2.83: updated to NWN 1.69.

I tend to cringe at cleric/wm in general TBH since it's been done to death and tend to see most cleric/wm/&lt;insert tumble class&gt; as a bit on the edam side of things.  It is pleasingly more RPable than most though which makes me feel beter about myself <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .  Not sure about a pure cleric being able to nail him, he has mostly the same AB and spells, enough cleric levels to resist most of the time (unless I don't understand dispell again which is highly possible), improved evasion to soften most spells, similar AC, more attacks a round and way higher damage.  I'm no cleric expert though so feel free to shoot me down painfully <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> .<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 11/18/05 20:54:57 (GMT) -- Kamiryn<br><br>Nice build.

In fact, I think I leveled in a slightly different way to the above and got to 11 cleric even earlier IIRC.

Hi, <br><br>Ok, I wrote a post where I calculated AB/AC/DMG and stuff but it appears to have disappeared into the ether somewhere (dododada, dododada), so here goes again.  I've decided to write the whole thing out, maybe someone will find it useful...if not it's stopping boredom setting in so I don't care <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> .<br><br><br><br><b>AB:</b> <br><br>AB Bonuses <br>37 Unbuffed Base <br>+4 Divine Power (if it works as advertised nowadays <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> ) <br>+5 Divine Favor <br>+1 Bless <br>+1 Prayer <br>+1 Aid <br>+2 Battle Tide <br>+5 Greater Magic Weapon <br>+5 War Domain Power (VERY short term) <br>Fully buffed we easily hit the +20 cap, without War Domain power, +19. <br><br>AB from STR Bonuses <br>+3 Emp. Bull Strength (good roll) <br>+2 Aura Vitality <br><br>So AB is +62/+61 when buffed with a good B.S. roll. <br><br><br><br><b>AC:</b> <br><br>A good thing about this build (and monk/caster builds in general) is that you can get extra AC from so many different sources.  You will lose quite a lot if caught flatfooted though so you have to keep an eye out.  Also, don't forget the tasty monkey boots you'll be able to use <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>29 Base unbuffed <br>+5 Magical Vestments <br>+5 Shield of Faith <br>+3 Emp. Cats Grace (good roll) <br>+3 Emp. Owls Wisdom     " <br>+4 Undeath's Eternal Foe <br>+2 Aura of Vitality <br>=51 <br><br>Where I play there are permahaste items, or you could take travel domain for another +4 AC. <br><br><br><br><b>DMG:</b> <br><br>This is the tricky one, so I'm bound to mess up... <br><br>STR <br>22 Base <br>+6 Emp.

If you've not dropped off to sleep by now, you'll notice that the damage output is pretty nice but that the build is VERY dependant on buffs...more so than a typical cleric.  If you can get ahold of an bonus damage spear then the damage gets even more nice thanks to the x4 crits, especially considering you're using a cacky little spear <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .  Also, for a 2 hander the AC is not bad at all, get hold of some WIS gear and things look even better.
