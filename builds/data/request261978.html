I have been on the forums a while, but hardly posted.  I recently got back into NWN, and would like to start<br>playing on some PWs.  This is my first post here.<br>I am seeking a build for a high magic world, epic level.  <br>I would say that I am familiar with the game, but a noob when it comes to the D&amp;D ruleset, so I apologize in <br>advance if what I am asking for is nubbish/stupid/impossible.<br><br>Could anyone come up with a build that fulfills the following:<br><br>must have: <br>-dual wield katanas<br>-playable 1-40<br>-PvP &amp; PvM<br>-toughness<br>-epic dodge &amp; slippery mind (if rogue-ish primarily)<br>-impr. expertise, wpn focus, impr. crit, epic focus &amp; prowess (if fighter-ish primarily)<br>-shadowdancer &amp; whirlwind /OR/ assassin &amp; 30 base str or dex<br>-armor skin (if fighter-ish primarily)<br>-epic fort<br>-epic will<br><br>would like to have, but not required:<br>-stealthy/sneaky stuff<br>-high HP; Hp very important<br>-self concealment<br>-impr. knockdown<br><br>must not rely on/have:<br>-dev.crit<br>-cleave<br><br>Before I continue, I have read the last dual-wielding katana thread (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/y6pl3c" target="_blank">Click here</a>), and have searched the build index.  I found a number of builds, but none that fit my above criteria, or I just didn't like them.  I'm also not good at char. building at all, so I don't know what feats to take out and replace with the ones I need, in case I did come accross a build that can fit my template.  However, there is one build by grizzled_dwarflord (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/y7f6rc" target="_blank">Click here</a>) that I really like.  Could that build be tailored to my needs?  I wouldn't know which feats to replace while at the same time not nerfing his build.  Also, if possible, I'd prefer more HP than that.  My main problem is i'd love to play that build, except working in Exotic proficiency + other stuff would take away a lot from the Assassin King, no?<br><br>"Cheesy" builds are ok and preferred since this will be my first attempt at this.<br>I think katanas are not optimal, but I'd like to use them anyway.  I realise that there are a few ways of going about<br>this, and they are probably drastically different from each other.  One would end up being mostly rogue levels <br>(rogue/assassin/SD) and the another mostly fighter (ftr/WM/CoT/etc.), and so on.  I don't care about class <br>combinations too much, I'm open to anything, as long as it kills with Katanas primarily, and has the reqs mentioned <br>above.<br><br>On a semi-related topic... Can anyone point me to a build where the <b>optimal</b> weapon is a katana?  Seems for whatever you need, there is something else that fits better (unless your character is large).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Vèñöm on 12/31/06 01:02</span></i></p>

Well, you can still decide if you want STR based with katanas, or switch to a different weapon (a finessable one) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

Have a look at this modified Assassin King. I definitely advice against dual wielding katanas though. WP: Exotic is in there so you can go with kukris, or drop the feat for something else (Stealthy for example) and go with shortswords. The further -2 AB that katana imposes will hurt your damage output and you chances to land death attacks too (cause you will hit less).<br><br><br>Fighter14 /Shadowdancer1 /Assassin25<br>Human, Any Evil, Playable 1-40, PvP &amp; PvM<br><br>Str16(30)<br>Int14<br>Wis8<br>Dex15(16)<br>Con14<br>Chr8<br><br>1 Fighter1, Dodge, Mobility, <b>Weapon Proficiency Exotic</b><br>2 Fighter2, Knockdown<br>3 Fighter3, <b>Weapon Focus: Katana</b><br>4 FIghter4, Blindfighting, Str17<br>5 Fighter5<br>6 Fighter6, TWF, Ambidexterity<br>7 Fighter7<br>8 Fighter8, Improved Knockdown, Str18<br>9 Fighter9, Improved TWF<br>10 Fighter10, <b>Wpn Spec: Katana</b><br>11 Fighter11<br>12 Fighter12, Improved Criticals, Toughness, Str19<br>13 Fighter13, (crossclass Hide/Move Silently 8 )<br>14 Assassin1<br>15 Assassin2, <b>Expertise</b>, (Ghostly Visage)<br>16 Assassin3, Str20<br>17 Assassin4<br>18 Assassin5, <b>Improved Expertise</b>, (Darkness)<br>19 Assassin6<br>20 Assassin7, Str21, (Invisibility)<br>21 Shadowdancer1, Epic WF, (Hide in Plain Sight)<br>22 Assassin8,<br>23 Assassin9, (Improved Invis)<br>24 Assassin10, Great Str I, Str23<br>25 Assassin11<br>26 Assassin12<br>27 Assassin13, Great Str II<br>28 Assassin14, ESF: Move Silently, Str25<br>29 Assassin15<br>30 Assassin16, Great Str III<br>31 Assassin17<br>32 Assassin18, ESF: Hide, Str27<br>33 Assassin19, Great Str IV<br>34 Assassin20<br>35 Assassin21<br>36 Assassin22, Armor Skin, <b>Great Dexterity</b>, Str29, Dex 16<br>37 Assassin23<br>38 Assassin24<br>39 Fighter14, Epic Prowess, Epic Wpn Spec<br>40 Assassin25, Str30<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!

Thank you for the build, Kail.<br><br>On the PW I am playing, I will be able to play a large character, so Katanas will be considered small weapons (already tested this on the PW).<br><br>I have a few questions.  Since I don't want to take knockdown (immunity everywhere), I will take out KD and IKD, and put in Stealthy and Blooded? Or maybe Blooded and Impr Init?  Would this be ok?<br><br>Also, is the only reason for Great Dex the +1 to skills (from 15-&gt;16)?  If that's all it is there for, how about taking another feat instead of Great Dex?  Or is G-Dex there for something else that I'm missing?<br><br>Thanks again!<br><br><br>EDIT -- sorry missed Toughness and the fact Dex 15 is Req for Ambi<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Vèñöm on 12/31/06 11:39</span></i></p>

Good thing I apologized in advance.<br>First I listed I wanted IKD, then I said I was taking all KDs out.<br><br>Now, I realised I can just use the original Assassin King build, take out KD and IKD, and put in Exotic Wpn and one other feat.

I would never drop EWS, that's +4 dmg vs everything. <br><br>DEX increase grants +1 ranged AB, +1 ref save, +1 initiative and +1 to dex skills. Besides, it makes it "easier" to wear lighter (and therefore "stealthier") armnor with just some minor Dex gear or even just a potion.<br><br>Keep present that superior initiative and improved initiative do not stack. Personally, I'd do without superior initiative   and probably even the other initiative feats and go with EWS and save boosters.<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!
