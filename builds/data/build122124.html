a weapon master who can hurt literally anyone really bad, he makes up for the percieved weakness vs. critical immune targets with favored enemy and bane of enemies.

Yes, there aren't too many dwarven pale masters, but there are dwarven defenders. With their damage reduction, and potential immunity to crit. items, the bane/favoured enemy could be useful.

I was thinking of adding dwarf, for both dwarven defenders and pvm duergars. If I were to do that, I would NOT drop elves, because pale masters are a lot bigger of a threat than a dwarven defender most times. I'd drop favored enemy : aberration and replace it with dwarf.<br>_________________<br>_,.-+:*'`'*:+-.,_,.-:*'{(( THE DEFILED ))}'*:-.,_,.-+:*'`'*:+-.,_<br>.±†T†±++±†T†±| <a href="http://www.thedefiled.tk" target="_blank">http://www.thedefiled.tk</a> |±†T†±++±†T†±.<br>'*+:-.,_,.-:*{( Delving into the origins of magic. )}*:-.,_,.-:+*'
