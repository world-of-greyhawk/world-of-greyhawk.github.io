The thought of combining the Barbarian class and it's outrageousness with that of the stealthy Rouge made me laugh. Making it a Half-Orc was even better. While the Uncanny Dodge doesn't stack, he still makes a fairly playable character, and one where you don't have to be too careful about the order in which you take levels.<br><br>Starting Stats (Ending):<br>Str- 18 (26)<br>Dex- 14<br>Con- 14 (16)<br>Wis- 8<br>Int- 12 (13)<br>Cha- 8<br><br>The guideline I can think of is to take 10 barbarian levels pre-epic, 3 rouge and then 7 Weapon Master. <br>I focused on the Greataxe, but there's room enough with your feats to do the Double-Axe if you'd prefer. <br><br>A partial list of feats at 40th level:<br>Uncanny Dodge 5<br>Damage Reduction 3<br>Imp. Evasion<br>Slippery Mind<br>Sneak (+8d6)<br>Greater Rage<br>Dev. Crit (Greataxe)<br><br>And some final skill scores:<br>Hide- 39<br>Intimidate- 39<br>Move SIlently- 36<br>Taunt- 28<br>Tumble- 42<br>UMD- 29<br><br>With a plain Greataxe, his attack is +40/35/30/25<br>He does 1-12 +12 damage, and has a 17-20 x4 crit range.<br><br>His saves, are really low:<br>Fort- 22<br>Reflex- 23<br>Will- 14!!!<br><br>His naked AC is 20 and my build had 407 Hit points. <br>He has the ability to use Greater Rage 5 times per day, and has fairly high Taunt and Intimidate skills when he runs out of rage. He can hide from most people and should be able to get in a sneak attack on those who are not immune. His does a minimum of 13 damage per hit otherwise.<br>The Dev. Crit ability can be sacrificed for a number of other feats, Knockdown probably being the most useful feat this character doesn't get. <br><br>Being that his Dex is only 14, he can wear the heaviest of medium armors without any penalty, and his high UMD skill should allow him to wear most of the good helmets, belts, etc. <br><br>Feedback/Improvements welcome.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 02/05/08 10:56</span></i></p>

Without the full list of his feats it's really hard to tell how powerful he is.<br>Moreover, that's rogue, not rouge.

Yes, useless without a level-by-level<br><br>Also if you lower CHA by 2, and raise WIS by 2, that will help your will save by one.

Or, drop the charisma to 6 and boost dexterity.<br><br>Any way, very cool and interesting build.

I did a Barb/Rogue/SD in the past but made him dex based and focused on terrifying rage. He had epic dodge instead of going the dev crit route, but in rage, he certainly dished out plenty of damage. He did enough damage to take out mithral golems without being really hurt at all and only using benign equipment. Its in the build index onder master of scare tactics.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>
