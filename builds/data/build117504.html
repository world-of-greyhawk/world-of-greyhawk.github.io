With an unhittable AC, 50% concealment from Improved Invisibility, 60/+20 Damage Resistance, Immunity to Critical Hits, Darkness+Ultravision, Find Traps, and Wounding Whispers, nothing can even fight *back.*<br><br>In return, with Bard Song, War Cry, +12 Strength Bonus from whatever items or buffs, Aid and Bless (from potions or a Scabbard of Bless), and a +5 Greatsword, this character will have an final Attack Bonus of about 56/51/46. He/she can still land a critical hit on a 15 (the assuming keen is on) against an AC 71 opponent. Add in Curse Song, a skill level 32 taunt, 2d6+23 *unbuffed* damage with a +5 greatsword, Great Cleave, and Overwhelming and Devastating Critical, there isn't much that can survive more than a few rounds against the Avatar.<br><br>Once the Avatar casts silence on him/herself, magic users are helpless once within the 30' spell radius. Most magic users are going to have horrible strength scores as well, so Balagorn's Horn can render them helpless just the same. With a Spellcraft skill of 45, Lesser Dispell can be used to counterspell any spells that manage to slip through. Improved Knockdown is really just overkill. Against Wizzy or Sorcy/Pale Masters with Immunity to Critical Hits and Epic Warding, the Avatar can just keep the caster under the Silence radius (recasting it as necessary) until Warding wears out and then the battle's pretty much over.<br><br><br>Let's see someone top this one .<br><br>Edited By Wildeyes on 03/18/04 00:26:35<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 02:28</span></i></p>
