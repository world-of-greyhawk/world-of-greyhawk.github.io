Hello, looking for a great AB having trouble with the feat setup. my server does have a few limitations.<br><br>Details:<br>5 lvl minimum for any classes by the time you hit 40. Also monk, cleric and SD all have a 15 lvl minimum.<br>Devastating Critical feat is NOT allowed and no skill dumping.<br><br>I know fighter 12 and WM 28 seems the be the norm but I'm having problems placing feats to the best effect.<br><br>I want to have Imp knockdown and Imp expertise i think will be useful later in levels to hit the AC cap(70) on the server.<br><br>Other info:<br>Keen is available on weapons and most ac/ab bonuses are around +5 sometimes 6 but that is more rare.<br><br>Any assistance would be most welcomed!

I would think that a build with 5 levels of another class would be stronger. Fighter 10/WM 25/Rogue 5 maybe?<br><br>I know you could possibly lose 2 AB (1 if you take any Rogue levels pre-epic, and 1 from dropping 3 levels of WM) but I think the benefits of having Rogue would out-weigh the negatives. <br><br>Have you thought about using a 3rd class? or are you set on Fighter/WM?

I'm trying to keep it as fighter/WM/dwarven defender or barbarian because the server has some weapons that if your one of those 4 only then it gives you some nice bonuses.

One idea you may want to consider, and this tags with gala, defender is very much like fighter or wm, so why take the 3rd, if not to make the character MORE?<br><br>Yes, you will be able to use an item, but you would be down 8 ac and UMD (which allows you to use ALOT of items).  Is this item WORTH that?   <br><br>I have absolutely nothing against doing a ft/wm/def.  I did a cleric/sd/wm iirc for certain items on a pw myself, though, if you look at what i got, it was more than just that item.  <br><br>The other thing to consider, def/wm's tend to be feat hogs.  Depending on how many lvls you use, you may just end up with a semi-decent build in the end.   <br><br>in the end, make a character you WANT to make cuz you will be playing it. If the build ends up not to your liking, oh well.  That's why we have character vaults <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

from my understanding the bonus to the weapon is like 2d10 and another 2d10 crit. then even some more to ab so they are quite nice despite the restrictions.

What is this weapon?<br><br>I ask because with junk like that, you really do want to avoid a strength build all together.  In high magic worlds, correction, worlds where you can find weapons with more than an enchantment on them, and dev crit is disabled, Epic dodge becomes GODLY (i know it is anyway, but now more so).  <br><br>Epic dodge means 13-16 rogue levels with weapon master and fighter!  You wont end up with as high weapon master lvls, but you will become a beast regardless.  <br><br>Now, if the weapon is unique (meaning that all the other weapons arent stacked to the hilt) then this becomes a moot argument.   So, just to clarify: when you have gear that has amazing stuff on it AND dev crit is gone, DEXERS rule!  In an environment where your gear isnt junked through the roof, they still rule, just dont hit as hard with each swing.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted <b>06/23/04</b> 21:16 (GMT) -- Anuis<br><br>Suolucider, Blitz 04, <b>avado</b>, Quisition, Boourns, ... welcome to the guild!

what is the weapon that you desperately want?  If it isnt finessable then dont go dexer.<br><br>In order to get the most efficient, look for rog 13/16 fighter 5-6 wm 19 type of thing.  Why?  19 wm gives you +4 ab where the next break is 22, where 3 lvls may or may not be stretched.  You want fighter for weapn spec and epic ws to add some damage (like having +12 str for damage).

LOL!  What i was trying to say is, Me thinks you are mistaken with the requirements for this mystical armor that you want to use, as are you with the weapon.  <br><br>See, IF an item says "used by FIghter" it DOESNT mean you must be 100% fighter!  It means you ONLY need fighter lvls, 1 at least (5 for your world).  <br><br>Thax is wrong.  In my mind, going on for 2 pages without giving adequate info FOR help ranks right up there with the infamous "What is uberest build" topics.  I guess it could be worse, but not by much.

I think what he meant by "pure Fighter" was that it must be one of the melee based classes he mentioned before (Fighter, Barbarian, DD, and WM). I could be wrong though.

I'm getting the impression the DMs give out the weapon to people who qualify or something similar.

armor must of slipped in there, yes pure fighter ment only classes allowed are fighter/wm/dd and barb.<br><br>I thought I gave info about the weapon. must not of given enough, there are a few weapons of power, basically sentient weapons. they only activate further abilities if you are built of the 4 above classes. they are otherwise typically +6 keen +2d6 something damage and +2d6 something damages more on crit. The special ability is reportedly an additional 2d10 base and bonus crit. Trying to get someone to give me more info but haven't found anyone. The weapons were reportedly made to encourage people to play pure melee classes with no spell abilities as those are typically the ones not chosen because of the limited soloability on them.

In my experience, when a server goes out of the way to do assinine things like this, it isnt worth it.   Now about your request, IF you cannot make a PURE melee build, you are in trouble my friend.  Not having to worry about mixing in other classes means you have no headaches at all.  You basically put 3 classes together that you like, ftr/barb/wm or what ever and put them in any order you want.  You dont need us for that.  It is unfortunate that it took us 2 pages to figure this out.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; -- Posted by Kail Pendragon  <br><br>Being hyperbolic is an integral part of Avado's being <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->
