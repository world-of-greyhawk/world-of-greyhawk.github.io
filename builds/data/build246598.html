Hi everybody! I haven't posted in a while (2 weeks), because I've been on holiday in sydney (with no access to NWN), but since there was nothing to do there, I made builds to pass the time.

Your naked AC is good, but your HP is low... heh, how did you expected HP with 8 CON? You actually take Self Concealment V at level 37, which means your DEX can be lowered without losing SFV... to gain more HP... lowering DEX to 19 would give you 3 points, although maybe lowering it more than that would be a problem... whatever you like.<br><br>Agreed, EWF, EWS and EP are great feats which you should take.<br><br>EDIT: Just noticed you didn't take pre-epic WS... what do you plan to do when the enemy is immune to sneaks?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/12/06 15:48</span></i></p>

Absolutely drop your CHA to 8 and put those points into CON. That alone will net you 120 HPs.<br><br>I'd also suggest dropping some Rogue for FTR levels. Perhaps 2 more FTR and 2 less Rogue. You don't lose any bonus feats that way, but you can at least pick up EWF and EWS (I suggest dropping Armor Skin to make room). You'd also get to do a Discipline skill dump if you wish.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...

Good point, why did you took CHA in the first place? this class spread does not gain anything with it.

Id' actually move Mobility to level 18 to replace "Thug".  You could then move weapon focus to level 6 and take weapon specialization on level 7.<br><br>In Epic, I would replace Rogue at levels 39 &amp; 40 with Fighter and take Epic Weapon Focus at 39 and Epic Weapon Specialization as the Fighter bonus feat on level 40.<br><br>Net result would be a loss of 2AC and 1d6 Sneak Attack for an AB increase of 2 and a guaranteed 6 points of damage. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    You won't lose any Rogue Bonus feats, but it would cost you 12 skill points (which you have plenty of).<br><br>As far as the Charisma Points, I'm with the others and would recommend placing those points in Con or Str.  If you look at your persuade skill, you would still have a net 40 in persuade even with an 8 in Chr.  From an RP perspective you could play yourself as an ugly but persuasive little fellow.<br><br>Just as an FYI, your AB and AC would be 1 higher than you quoted in your post due to the Halfling racial bonuses.  26 base + 12 Dex + 1 Size + 1 WF = 38 AB.

Hmmm, I can understand an RP perspective, but not if that's making you resist nothing, +3 persuade checks versus 120 HP, survival is a part of the game, and you need to level up to increase checks too.

You aren't likely to ever run into a situation where you'll need charisma or focus bonuses to your persuade checks when you have a high persuade skill.

I had a few thoughts to submit (I realize some of these were already mentioned):<br><br>Stats (inclusive of racial-modifier): Starting (Ending) <br>STR 12 +1<br>DEX 18 +4 (32 +11)<br>CON 12 +1<br>WIS 10<br>INT 14 +2<br>CHA 10<br><br>06: Rogue 3 Weapon Focus<br>07: Fighter 4 Weapon Specialization<br>09: Rogue 5 Toughness<br>12: Rogue 8 Mobility<br>18: Rogue 14 Improved TWF<br><br>The key advantage to putting the 2 points into WIS is the extra point in Will Save, as it won't do much to help the 41 Listen score.<br><br>Overall, I really like the look of the build.<br><br>---<br>Angel Of Death 1982
