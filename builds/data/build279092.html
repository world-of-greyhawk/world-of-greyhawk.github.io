This is my first attempt at a character build and I call him the furious huntsmen. What I wanted here was a dex based fighter with both Bane of Enemies and Terrifying Rage. I don't have a background story for him but feel free to comment and critcise or just throw out suggestions. His saves seem pretty week and I didn't see any builds like this in the NWN Character Build Search so thought I'd throw it up and see if there was a reason for that <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>I figure this character would be best in a low magic world.<br><br>The Furious Huntsmen<br>Human<br>Strength  12<br>Dexterity  16 (30)<br>Constitution  14<br>Wisdom  14<br>Intelligence  12<br>Charisma  8<br><br>1: Rogue point blank shot, rapid shot, sneak 1d6<br>2: Ranger  FE undead<br>3: Ranger <br>4: Barbarian Knockdown<br>5: Ranger <br>6: Ranger weapon finesse<br>7: Barbarian Uncanny dodge 1<br>8: Ranger FE Elementals<br>9: Ranger Animal companion, WF longbow<br>10: Barbarian <br>11: Ranger<br>12: Ranger toughness<br>13: Barbarian barbarian rage 2x<br>14: Ranger ITWF<br>15: Ranger Called shot, FE aberrations<br>16: Barbarian <br>17: Ranger<br>18: Ranger IC longbow<br>19: Barbarian <br>20: Rogue Evasion<br>21: Ranger EC, EW Longbow<br>22: Ranger<br>23: Barbarian<br>24: Ranger Great dex I, FE constructs<br>25: Ranger <br>26: Barbarian BR 3x<br>27: Ranger Great dex II<br>28: Ranger<br>29: Barbarian <br>30: Ranger Great dex III<br>31: Ranger FE Magical beasts<br>32: Barbarian Uncanny dodge III<br>33: Ranger Epic Ranger, Bane of enemies<br>34: Barbarian damage reduction I<br>35: Barbarian BR 4x<br>36: Barbarian Uncanny dodge IV, Great dex IV<br>37: Barbarian Damage reduction II<br>38: Barbarian BR 4x<br>39: Barbarian Uncanny dodge V, BR 5x, Terrifying Rage <br>40: Rogue Sneak 2d6<br><br>Naked AC 28<br>Saves<br>For, 25<br>Ref, 29<br>Wil. 18<br>Base attack 29 <br>dual wielding mundane handaxes AB +37/+32/+27/+22<br>Offhand AB +37/+32<br>Mundane longbow AB +42/=37/+32/+27<br><br><br>Hope this is formatted right<br>Oops, I forgot the skill layout here it is. 42 dis Max Hide, move silently, Intimidate, Spot, Tumble and 25 into use magical device.<br><br>One more thing I forgot I didn't put his max health,don't know how to figure that out, but 430 is the health I got from just rolling him with nothing on.<br><br><br>It's easy to figure, just 21 x 10 (21 ranger lvls, 10 hit dice for rangers), 16 x 12 (16 barb lvls, 12 hit dice for barbs), then 3 x 6 (3 rogue lvls, 6 HD for rogues).

Looks good.  Just a note on build outline:  dont worry about adding the feats you get as class feats, unless they are important for a feat (ie , sd giving prereqs for an epic dodger, so a person not accustom to that class can follow).  It makes the build too cumbersome otherwise.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

I made a build quite like that.<br>There are a few differences though, mine is STR-based. <br>It uses Assassin instead of Rogue to avoid xp-penalty. Yours has xp-penalty starting at lvl 10 if I'm not mistaken. <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "249743", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Bloodred Vengeance</a><br><br>Nice build though, smooth and efficient. To bad about the xp-penalty, but it's not much one can do about it. Lack of damage can also be a problem in a dex build like this, when not fighting FE's. It can be compensated by UMD or traps.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Wow very similar build there, I didn't think of exp penalty, but I took the rogue for the evasion feat and tumble and UMD. The uncanny dodge you get from barbarian seemed like a good addition for a dex based character and I was trying to make one that would be good all around with either a bow or up close melee fighting. <br>Thanks for the comments, I made this character trying to think up an original character for a RP server and wanted to know If I made any mistakes that would be obvious to more experienced builders. Not really looking for the best PvP character but I don't want him to be a pushover either. Any suggestions that might improve this build is totally welcome.
