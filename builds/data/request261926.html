I posted this in the General section XD.<br><br>Hello! I have been playing NWN for a few months and I have been wondering....are Ftr/Cleric's/WM good? A friend of mine told me they are. In a server I play, they beat me up pretty well  Anyways....I've come here to get help from all you guys! My server is a Local Vault and im looking for a straight level 40 build made for PvP. I also want that 10-20 crit range (Scimitar), Imp. Power Attack, High Str and Dev Crit ...I've also been experimenting with some Ftr/Cleric/WM's and I only want lvl 5 spells so I was thinking about 16 WM/ 15 Ftr/ 9 Cleric.<br><br>The restrictions are:<br>1. No DR is allowed on items<br>2. No regen is allowed on items but is allowed to be cast<br>3. No TS on items<br>4. No on-hits or on-hit cast<br>5. No immunities<br>6. Many characters have Dmg Resistance -/50 to all dmg

How about this. I haven't paid too much attention to the feat order since you said it was straight to 40, but for many things I didn't have much choice anyway because so many feats are necessary for WM and Dev Crit. Stats are also a bit scarce (need minimum of STR 25, DEX 13, WIS 15, and INT 13 to qualify for everything), and CON takes that hit, unfortunately. You could start with 16 STR and 12 CON if you want, and drop the last Great STR, which would lower your damage, AB, and Dev Crit DC by 1 for 40 more HP and an extra feat if you want.<br><br>Dwarf<br>Fighter 8/Cleric 10/Weapon Master 22<br><br>STR: 17 (28)<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 10<br>WIS: 14 (15)<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 6<br><br>01: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Scimitar, Dodge<br>02: Fighter(2): Mobility<br>03: Fighter(3): Expertise<br>04: Fighter(4): STR+1, Spring Attack<br>05: Fighter(5)<br>06: Fighter(6): Weapon Specialization: Scimitar, Whirlwind Attack<br>07: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Scimitar<br>08: Weapon Master(2): STR+1<br>09: Weapon Master(3): Power Attack<br>10: Weapon Master(4)<br>11: Weapon Master(5)<br>12: Weapon Master(6): STR+1, Cleave<br>13: Weapon Master(7)<br>14: Weapon Master(8)<br>15: Weapon Master(9): Improved Critical: Scimitar<br>16: Weapon Master(10): STR+1<br>17: Cleric(1): Domain Trickery, Domain Healing<br>18: Cleric(2): Great Cleave<br>19: Cleric(3)<br>20: Cleric(4): STR+1<br>21: Fighter(7): Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>22: Fighter(8): Epic Weapon Specialization: Scimitar<br>23: Cleric(5)<br>24: Cleric(6): STR+1, Great Strength I<br>25: Cleric(7)<br>26: Cleric(8)<br>27: Cleric(9): Knockdown<br>28: Weapon Master(11): STR+1<br>29: Weapon Master(12)<br>30: Weapon Master(13): Improved Knockdown, Overwhelming Critical: Scimitar<br>31: Weapon Master(14)<br>32: Weapon Master(15): STR+1<br>33: Weapon Master(16): Epic Skill Focus: Discipline, Devastating Critical: Scimitar<br>34: Weapon Master(17)<br>35: Weapon Master(18)<br>36: Weapon Master(19): STR+1, Great Strength II, Armor Skin<br>37: Weapon Master(20)<br>38: Weapon Master(21)<br>39: Weapon Master(22): Toughness, Epic Prowess<br>40: Cleric(10): WIS+1<br><br>Concentration: 42 (42)<br>Discipline: 42 (61)<br>Intimidate: 4 (2)<br>Spellcraft: 40 (42)<br>Tumble: 20 (21)<br><br>HP: 420<br>AB: 47<br>AC: 28<br>Fort save: 22<br>Ref save: 21<br>Will save: 21<br>(+10 vs spells, +2 vs poison)<br>Cleric spells per day: 6/6/6/4/4/3<br>39 Dev Crit DC<br><br>All these stats are using mundane items only, and without buffs.

I'd suggetst at least 15 Cleric lvls to max out buffs at least (shield of faith apart which maxes at 18th lvl). Maybe Cleric 17/FTR 4/WM 19 going for DP exploit.<br><br>But before giving further advice, what gear is available on your server?<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 12/30/06 13:41</span></i></p>

Agreed with avado, only level 5 spells is just wrong, when you make a Cleric you want it for the buffs, so you should take 15 levels for max AB buffs, 18 levels for max long-term AC buffs and 20 levels for max damage buffs, and more levels for all the short duration buffs, which are quite strong btw.<br><br>Damage Reduction and Damage Resistance don't really make a big practical difference if you specify the reduction works "#/-", or against any magical enhancement, although Damage Resistance can get better, since Damage Reduction is used for physical, and Damage Resistance can apply to any element. My mistake for the confusion.<br><br>Anyway Damage Resistance 50/- on items means you're on a very high magical environment, or else it's completely unbalanced attack vs defense. Seriously, I want to know which level of magical weapons and armor are available on your PW. At any rate, if that's true, you should be looking for a specialized-in-Harm Cleric/Druid (not direct combat) or an Exhalted Sorcerer type of build, to avoid the resistances, or else you won't kill anything.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/31/06 17:55</span></i></p>
