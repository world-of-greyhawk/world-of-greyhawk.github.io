There are only two other builds that use this class split. Again, i'm not sure how to link builds. If someone could show me how it would be much appreciated.<br><br>I enjoy the playing the Black Guard class. I dont really like the sneak attack ability for it though. When I think of a really evil fighter I imagine a fighter who fights with dignity and respect and has moments of uncontrolable rage (barbarian).<br><br>Fighter 5/ Barbarian 15/ Black Guard 20<br><br>Playable 1-40 PvM (untested PvP)<br>Human<br>Chaotic Evil<br><br>STR	16 (30)		<br>DEX	8<br>CON	14	<br>WIS	8		<br>INT	12		<br>CHA	16<br><br>Max HP  550<br>BAB      30<br>High AB  44<br>Sneak Damage 6d6<br><br>Skills			<br><br>Discipline 	43	<br>Intimidate	43 	<br>Taunt		43<br>Tumble		20<br>Spell Craft	10<br><br>Saves<br><br>Fortitude       31<br>Reflex          20<br>Will            20<br><br>1.

Hey, Gale: Just a quick look, and Neat! (and your neat evil guy needs a name - furiously evil? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">    ok, kiddin', but here's some quick thoughts for you (just some thoughts, 'kay? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  hmmm, take four ftr staight, to get to weapon specialization right away - the extra damage points will do you great earlier; also, might wanna drop a ftr level for another brbn level - at 16 brbn, you get yerself another cool rage use (i.e, 5xday), and also uncanny V. <br><br>Just a quick question for you, though: why 20 BG -- I love 'em myself, but 10 should do, no? (i.e., you're not going for sneaks, divines or smite, and your bg dark blessing, nice touch, -- and, yes, nice bonus feats at 13, 16 and 19, which is def. cool; bbut 10 ftr wld net you 5 instead of 3 (just a thought); better, (and just another thought) would be more barbarian -- at least 4 more (plus one already suggested for 20 total) for even better rage, and even some damage reduction to boot (not too shabby, eh?). Here's a link that you might find helpful, (I sure know that I do <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <a href="http://www.nwnwiki.org/Barbarian" target="_blank">http://www.nwnwiki.org/Barbarian</a><br><br>Otherwise, Rage on, and really, really neat! ~ Tyr  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 10/18/06 05:54</span></i></p>

Thanks for the reply Tyr. You make some really good points. I guess I just went 20 Black Guard because I wanted a heavy Black Guard build...but I think the 10 fighter/ 20 barbarian/ 10 black guard build that you mention would be more to my liking. I will try it out.<br>Thanks!
