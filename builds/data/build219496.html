First post, whee! Came up with this build the other day and have been playing around with it a bit, was hoping some of the more experienced builders here might be able to help me get more out of him though so let me know what ya think <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">      <br><br><b>playable 1 - 40 PvM</b><br><br>Monk/ShadowDancer/WeaponMaster 12/5/23<br>Human Any Lawful<br><br>stats<br>Str 10<br>Dex 18(28)all stats here<br>Con 12<br>Int 14<br>Wis 10<br>Cha 8<br><br>1:Monk1 Dodge, Expertise<br>2:Monk2<br>3:Monk3 Mobility<br>4:Monk4 <br>5:Monk5 <br>6:Monk6 Spring Attack<br>7:Monk7 <br>8:Monk8 <br>9:Monk9 Weapon Focus (kama)<br>10:Monk10 <br>11:Monk11 need 10 points in hide, 8 in Move Silently and at least 5 in Tumble here<br>12:SD1 Whirlwind Attack  need 4 points in intimidate here<br>13:WM1 Weapon of Choice (kama)<br>14:WM2<br>15:WM3 Weapon Finesse<br>16:WM4<br>17:WM5<br>18:WM6 Ambidextery<br>19:WM7<br>20:WM8<br>21:SD2 Two Weapon Fighting<br>22:SD3<br>23:SD4<br>24:WM9 Improved Two Weapon Fighting<br>25:WM10<br>26:WM11<br>27:WM12 Improved Critical (kama)<br>28:WM13 Epic Weapon Focus (kama)<br>29:WM14<br>30:SD5 Epic Dodge (need to put 30 points into hide and tumble here)<br>31:WM15<br>32:WM16 Armor Skin<br>33:WM17 Toughness<br>34:WM18<br>35:WM19 Epic Prowess<br>36:WM20 Epic Toughness I<br>37:WM21<br>38:WM22 Epic Toughness II<br>39:WM23 Epic Toughness III<br>40:Monk12 <br><br>Skills: 257 total skill points.

Add in +12 dex and your atk jumps up to 51, which isn't stellar but not terrible either.  Fort and will saves leave some room for improvement so possibly switching the epic toughness feats for epic will/fortitude would be more beneficial, though at least one of them, maybe two were taken as WM bonus feats.  Could also switch out the epic toughness taken as a bonus feat for Blinding Speed if haste items aren't available.  I admittedly have not played this char on a pw yet, just used a trainer to lvl him and imagine that until at least lvl 15 when you pick up weapon finesse it would be quite rough.  The Weapon Master required feats could also be moved around a little bit, possibly take mobility instead of expertise for example and weapon focus earlier to make it a little less painful, and once you pick up HiPS at lvl 12 life should get a little easier as well.  Doesn't look like he'd really come into his own until at least late teens, early 20's, but then the feats come quickly and by 30 he's picked up all the feats necessary by that point and should be able to survive 30-40 much better(assuming he can get some help from items on his saves).  Let me know if I left anything out, tried to cover it all and all feedback good or bad is welcome.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 05/27/10 21:15</span></i></p>

@Kaliban: Sorry for the legibility, was in a hurry to get to class so kind of threw it up there <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>@Cinn: Thanks so much, definately improves the build and makes it much more playable.  I'd probably take Spring attack before Expertise as I never use it but that's just me. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">   Also upped all the saves by 1 which isn't huge but with as low as they are every little bit helps.  Have been a bit apprehensive to build this one on my current pw as those first 15 levels were going to be super tough.  Your  was definately takes some of the edge off.  Thanks again.<br><br>Would the build be better served by switching out the WM for ranger?  The dual wielding feats would be taken care of leaving room for another +1 dex possibly, not to mention the need for some of the WM feats would not be there.  22 lvls would net you 6 FE's, enough for all player races but one if you like PvP and you could pick up Bane, allbeit very endgame.  May switch this one out and see which one looks better, thanks again for the replies, greatly appreciated.

Spring attack totally negates attacks of opportunity while moving in combat, This means that if you decide to run away or try to say, run around enemies to generate your own AoO against them, you won't get any back. Though Tumble will eventually prevent them anyway, it's nice to get this early. I also means you can run awaaaay without fear of dying from an AoO. At low levels, Expertise will probably drain your AB too much to be of much use, unless you really need that AC to survive. Then again, you're a monk. Just leave <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

as a side note if building this char for use from lvling from 1 up he works better starting out with fists, perhaps until you pick up weapon focus.  Once you hit lvl 4 and your fists go do 1d8 fists seem the better option for the next few lvls

Since you only have 10 points in intelligence, you can't take expertise, which means no Weapon Master for you. Surprised everyone missed it.

This is a build that would be illegal no matter what version of NWN you have.  Yes, one can figure out where the error is, but there was an error, and these things need to be stamped out, no?  As you may have noticed, a bumped build isn't nearly as distracting a thing as it used to be.  I still think it's a good idea to fix obvious mistakes.  Pre-1.69 builds, or anything which has been made illegal by a rule change, certainly don't need to be touched, but that aint the same thing.<br><br>Actually though, if I could snap my fingers and have my way, it would be great to have a note on every build 1.69 broke saying that it only works on version 1.68 or lower.  Version number probably should have been a requirement to begin with.   *shrug*

A typo is by no means a reason to call a build illegal, when, as clear as day, you can see that indeed, the builder used int 14 (based on skill points). <br><br>We commented on this build for one reason: someone using the search engine decided to look way back in time and noticed a typo.  Seeing this, decided to point out something so insignificant and irrelevant that it was left for 3 years!  Edited?  sure, WE DID!  Editing happens in more ways than a Mod going in and physically changing a post.  Editing happens from US in followup posts.  <br><br>Think of it this way: Monk/wm's are so powerful that this idea sat for 3 years without comment.  Is there a reason?  Of course there is.  Monk/wm's while nice idea, arent terribly popular.  <br><br>Since it bugs you so muhc, I nominate onion eater for the job of BUILD EDITOR AND CHIEF!  We DEMAND that his ONLY duty is to go through EVERY build in the guild (there are only 1950 or so) and edit every single one to format AND accuracy for 1.69! to be cmpleted BEFORE Dec 25, 2008 at 6am, well, you dont want to know.  How does that sound?<br><br>onion, you cant go around giving work to our Mods.  We seem to wear out mods on this guild like no-one's business.  One mod, who i hope is doing well, simply VANISHED from the workload.  Didnt say goodbye or anything.  <br><br>Now that we are so OT, can we please leave this bumped build to die in the dark places of 2005?<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 11/21/08 01:31 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>But don't listen to everything avado said... </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

I've got my own personal Hell day in and day out already...<br><br>All I'm saying is accuracy counts.  I don't even care if things get edited.  Some things, like the changes 1.69 made ( Boo! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_mad.gif">  ) are obviously too numerous to mention.   No, I don't need every build w/ WS: club to be bumped.  Other things, like a typo that 'breaks' a build, should at least be noted.  A post in the thread is totally sufficient, but I do think that much is warranted, no matter how old the build.  I mean, if we weren't bumping it w/ our off topic arguing, it would have quickly sank back into obscurity, which we all know is where every monk build belongs...
