Hmmm, I think you could very well change a skill for Hide and take Self Concealment, or forget it if you think you're hard enough to hit already, but I think it's never enough.<br><br>I suppose one of those crazy AB Arcane Archers still hits you, with +12 items, a probable average of 75, haste and rapid shot, you get hit quite bad, special AA arrows like Imbued or Seeking would be bad too.<br><br>Well, you have Improved Evasion, and high DEX, so you're not defenseless against casters. Ok, 260 HP against an empowered or maximized IGMS sounds bad. It's still great against stunners and devers, you're totally inmune.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 04/02/06 22:13</span></i></p>

Yeah you are right  with rogue as main class and 14 int you have enough skill points to max out hide / ms. I didn't wrote  it cause on my server 43 hide / ms + dex modifier isn't that good to "hide in corner " but it can helps vs prcs in the leveling and also vs low listen /spot guys without true seeing.i'd recommend to max  heal to use heal kits with good effectivness.<br><br>The point of the build is to go melee vs casters(mage /cleric) and archers he'll have hard time.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By malibu-fr on 04/02/06 22:48</span></i></p>
