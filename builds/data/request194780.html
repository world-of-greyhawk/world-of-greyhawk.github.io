How about a build with more Fighter levels, with Weapon Specialisation and Epic Weapon Specialisation?<br><br>For example, look at Torias' <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_reliablearcher.html" target="_blank">Reliable Archer</a> build?<br>_________________<br>Don't take life too serious.

Your BAB is only your attack bonus from your levels.  It doesn't take anything else into consideration.  Even the enchant arrow feats from Arcane Archer go to AB, not BAB.  29 BAB is pretty much the maximum you would get from an Arcane Archer build, since you need a level of wizard, bard, or sorcerer.  The only way you could manage 30 BAB would be to take a fighter type (fighter, barbarian, paladin, ranger, etc.) for your first 20 levels, and then take one level of your arcane class and start taking arcane archer levels.  But doing that would make the character a much weaker archer for much of its life (and overall as well), and is certainly not worth it for 1 BAB.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;The build types I go with are generally rogue/wiz or bard/barbarian or bard/monk based and I shoot for at least 23 levels of arcane archer, 27 if I can manage them.<br><br>Frankly Ive given up on the idea of dev crit archers as the best threat range you can get with a bow is around 17-20, which with 4 to 6 attacks per round (haste, rapid shot) is a dubious idea at best, so maxed bab, maxed ab builds are the way to go.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I'm playing a rogue/wizard/arcane archer right now, and I'm finding it a lot of fun.  The extra sneak damage is very helpful, and with evasion (soon to be improved evasion) and my killer reflex saves, I basically never take damage from reflex save spells.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;The reason I push for such high attack ratings is to combat damage reduction and high ac builds, and the fact that a full 29 level arcane archer has +15 to damage with a normal arrow, enough to make all the devcrit melee demi-god wanna-bes cry 'mommy'.<br><br>If someone can give me a few tips on getting that 30 BAB with enchant arrow fifteen while maintaining the ability to dodge fireballs, etc I'd be really grateful.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Well...as I said before, 29 BAB is the best you're going to get.  You'll need at least 29 levels of arcane archer to get the +15, which means you have to take at least one level of wizard, sorcerer, or bard pre-epic.  But in order to get something like evasion to dodge fireballs completely as opposed to just taking half damage, you'd need to take something like rogue, shadowdancer, or monk, all of which would lower your AB further.  You will have decent reflexes from 10 levels of arcane archer pre-epic though, especially with your high dex.  If you want to maximize your AB as much as possible, start with an elf with 20 DEX, go fighter(9)/wizard(1)/Arcane Archer(10) pre-epic.  Then take Arcane Archer all the way to 30 in epic levels.  Put all your stat points into DEX,  You'll have 12 epic feats (7 regular, 5 arcane archer bonus feats).  Take Epic Weapon Focus, Epic Prowess, and then take Great Dexterity for all the rest of your epic feats (all 10).  So you'll end with a Dex of 40.<br><br>AB = 29 (BAB) + 15 (from DEX) + 4 (from weapon focus, epic weapon focus, and epic prowess) + 15 (arcane archer enchant arrow XV) = 63 AB with a mundane bow.<br><br>Which sounds exactly like what you said you managed to get yourself before.  I think you already know how to get the max possible AB out of an archer,  You just didn't realize that was the best you could do.<br><br>Steve<br><br>Edit: Yeah, as Syrath pointed out, with Bard Song and Cat's Grace, a Bard could eke out another point of AB or so, although the Bard Song doesn't last very long.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 05/12/05 17:03</span></i></p>

16 Rogue/2 Wizard/22 AA is definitely the way to go since you can get Epic Dodge and 5 Self Concealments.
