I've seen one or two examples, but I'd like a build specifically designed to take out mages.<br><br>Must Have:<br>- Good AB.<br>- Good damage.<br>- Moderate HP.<br>- At least one of the following: Greater dispelling, Mordenkainen's Disjuction, spell resistance 45+.<br>- Must be undispellable.<br>- Must be strength focused.<br>- Must have some stealth capabilities.<br>- Has to be melee focused.<br><br>All these can be achieved by whatever means necessary, as long as the 'Musts' are kept!<br><br>Looks like this could be a challange, so thanks in advance anyone who wants to submit a build, and good luck. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By K U R T H on 11/15/06 00:57</span></i></p>

Based on some of the info I learned in my recent, Sorc/PM/Monk thread about SR (btw I according to one poster the SR you want is beyond the games cap iirc).<br><br>Sounds like Monks gonna fit your bill.  Mostly monk and alot of it.  It fits the SR, stealth, melee, damage, AB, HP requirements.  If you add in a good amount of cleric (not sure how much is required before it cant be dispelled, I didnt realize that was possible) you fit your casting requirements.  Maybe something like 18/18/4.  The 4 being Fighter for more feats, AB etc.  OR 20/20. <br><br>Really just spitballing here as Monk and Cleric are two classes I dont play as much.

Monks can reach 70 SR. You will be immune to anything SR protects against with 66 SR, although with 60 you'll be safe almost every time, since most pure mages don't waste feats on penetration.<br><br>The best mage-slayer I have seen is <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "196360", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Magebane V2</a> by Mithradates. I fins myself linking this build time and again. Feel free to change it a bit if you want, like taking a bit Rogue for UMD if you find out 60 SR is what you need.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Isn't it 25 levels to be undispellable?<br><br>Caster making dispel check: 20+15=35 (max for Greater Dispelling)<br>Caster defending vs dispel: 11+25=36 (the 11 is a set number right?)<br><br>People just go to 26 to get the bonus feat. Right?
