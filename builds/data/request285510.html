So it's been quite some time since I've played nwn and I decided to load it up and give it another shot.  While thinking of what to play I came across a class combo that wasn't in the search engine and thought I'd ask here before delving too far into it.<br><br>The thought was to be a dual wielding melee who wouldn't be totally useless against casters.  If at all viable it would probably be more pvp oriented but this is just on a whim so who knows.<br><br>So the idea was a ranger/monk/pally, guessing 9/15/16 though I haven't really thought this out much at all.  The idea being able to dw HA for max dispels on enemy casters.  Ranger to 9 was obviously just for the free dw talents though that be substituted for ftr or maybe even wm /shrug.<br><br>really just looking for thoughts on this before building a completely useless character.  Any input is welcome, thanks in advance =D.

Well, on first thought, I don't advice to try to go with builds you can't find on the searcher, most of the time you don't find them because they suck.<br><br>Now, Ranger/Monk/Paladin is not such a strong build for PvP, and 9/15/16 is horrible IMO, if you're going to use Holy Avenger then what are the 15 monk levels for? I'd take Fighter instead, a solid EWS, BAB and feats. The other thing is your AC, being a Ranger for the dual wielding you can't use heavy armor, and you won't deal damage as a dexer in such build, if what you want is Holy Avenger for PvP, Paladin/Sorcerer/RDD or Paladin/Fighter/X are good choices, I like Paladin/Blackguard/Fighter, some CHA to boost saves and holy damage is always nice. It's pretty easy to take Dual-wielding feats as a Fighter.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
