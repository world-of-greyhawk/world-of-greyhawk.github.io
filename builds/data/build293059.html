This is my second entry here.  I'd love any feedback from the other members.  The premise was a character that could take on a larger enemy force by using his environment for cover and tactical advantage.  Thus, the Bushwhacker was born.  There are some SD/Rangers and some STR-based rangers, but this build came up unique in a search.<br><br>Ranger(32), Fighter(6), Shadowdancer(2), Human<br><br>STR: 16 (28)<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 12<br>CHA: 8<br><br>01:Ranger(1): Dodge, Mobility, Favored Enemy, R: {Dual Wield}<br>02:Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>03:Fighter(2): Power Attack, Cleave<br>04:Fighter(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>05:Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Greatsword<br>06:Ranger(2): Blind Fight<br>07:Ranger(3)<br>08:Ranger(4): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>09:Ranger(5): Great Cleave, Favored Enemy<br>10:Ranger(6)<br>11:Ranger(7)<br>12:Ranger(8): STR+1, Improved Critical: Greataxe, (STR=19)<br>13:Ranger(9): R: {Improved Two-Weapon Fighting}<br>14:Ranger(10): Favored Enemy<br>15:Ranger(11): Toughness<br>16:Ranger(12): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>17:Ranger(13)<br>18:Ranger(14): Iron Will<br>19:Ranger(15): Favored Enemy<br>20:Ranger(16): STR+1, (STR=21)<br>21:Shadowdancer(1): Great Strength I, SD: {Hide in Plain Sight}, (STR=22)<br>22:Shadowdancer(2): SD: {Darkvision, Evasion, Uncanny Dodge I}<br>23:Ranger(17)<br>24:Ranger(18): STR+1, Overwhelming Critical: Greatsword, (STR=23)<br>25:Ranger(19)<br>26:Ranger(20): Favored Enemy<br>27:Ranger(21): Great Strength II, (STR=24)<br>28:Ranger(22): STR+1, (STR=25)<br>29:Ranger(23): Bane of Enemies<br>30:Fighter(5): Devastating Critical: Greatsword<br>31:Ranger(24)<br>32:Ranger(25): STR+1, Favored Enemy, (STR=26)<br>33:Fighter(6): Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword, Epic Weapon Specialization: Greatsword<br>34:Ranger(26): Epic Prowess<br>35:Ranger(27)<br>36:Ranger(28): STR+1, Epic Will, (STR=27)<br>37:Ranger(29): Favored Enemy<br>38:Ranger(30): Favored Enemy<br>39:Ranger(31): Armor Skin<br>40:Ranger(32): STR+1, Favored Enemy: Reptilian Humanoids, (STR=28)<br><br><br><br>Hitpoints: 476<br>Skillpoints: 250<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 25/24/18<br>Saving Throw bonuses: <br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 43 (melee), 33 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 19/29<br>Spell Casting: Ranger(4)<br><br>Animal Empathy 42(41), Disable Trap 1(2), Discipline 43(52), Heal 43(45), Hide 43(45), Move Silently 43(45), Open Lock 2(4), Tumble 25(27)<br><br><br><b>Notes:</b>  You end up with a pretty decent melee presence.  Ideally, I would use a two-handed weapon and heavy armor.  If dex-boosting gear was available, perhaps dual-wielding in leathers?

Nice and juicy melee build! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>A couple of suggestions:<br><br>By taking the second SD level later, you can get a better tumble rank and +3 AC.<br><br>You have a very high animal empathy. You say something about using the resources of the wilderness, but do any animal have such a high DC? You could spend some points in spot or listen to be able to find the creatures hiding in the bushes.<br><br>I question if a stealth skill rank of 43 is enough to hide effectively in full plate against lvl 40 creatures. A creature could cross class spot and still be able to see you every time they beat 14 on a d20 roll<b>*</b>. The successful spot rolls would be more frequent earlier in the carreer (eg. every time you beat 4 on a d20 roll at lvl 20).<br>I have seen other builders take ESF in the stealth skills to make it worthwile to HIPS a full plated str based character.<br>But maybe the spells one with the land and camouflage is enough to make things work after all?<br><br>*assuming: <br>your hide rank 43<br>their spot rank 21<br>difference is 22<br>Your armor check penalty is 8<br>Your dex bonus equals their wis bonus (eg. another ranger)<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 03/03/08 16:41</span></i></p>

Nifty build. One comment though: Baneblade is not a scythe master. It doesn't even take Exotic Weapons (I personally hate scythes anyway).<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Sorry.. I don't know why I thought it was a scythe build, but I was looking at tons of rngr/ftr/sd's and must have gotten them confused...<br><br>I have actually gotten this guy to level 40 now.  He sneaks just fine actually.  I do have to turn off stealth and turn it back on to shake an observant enemy sometimes.  However, I think it's fine.  Hide/Move Silent starts at 34/34 (after the -8 armor check pen).. add +4 to both for one with the land, +10 hide for camouflage, and 1-2 to both for cat's grace.<br><br>I did make some adjustments to the build as I levelled though.  <br><br>I moved the SD levels to 22 and 37 to max tumble ranks.<br>I took two points from wisdom and added them to consitution.  The level 3/4 spells didn't seem worthwhile in a mid-high magic environment.<br>I replaced toughness with knockdown.  I already got the hitpoints from the con boost and knockdown made the ambush tactics that much more deadly.  With the ability to catch enemies flat-footed, I didn't think IKD was needed.<br><br>In my opinion, skills often vary with your environment.  In the world I play in, there are certainly epic animals that you could use the high animal empathy skills with.  On the flip side, I could see using those skills for spot and listen or in trap skills fitting in with the general idea of this build.<br><br><br>1-20 looks like this now:<br>01:Ranger(1): Dodge, Power Attack, Favored Enemy, R: {Dual Wield}<br>02:Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>03:Fighter(2): Knockdown, Cleave<br>04:Fighter(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>05:Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Greatsword<br>06:Ranger(2): Blind Fight<br>07:Ranger(3)<br>08:Ranger(4): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>09:Ranger(5): Great Cleave, Favored Enemy<br>10:Ranger(6)<br>11:Ranger(7)<br>12:Ranger(8): STR+1, Improved Critical: Greataxe, (STR=19)<br>13:Ranger(9): R: {Improved Two-Weapon Fighting}<br>14:Ranger(10): Favored Enemy<br>15:Ranger(11): Mobility<br>16:Ranger(12): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>17:Ranger(13)<br>18:Ranger(14): Iron Will<br>19:Ranger(15): Favored Enemy<br>20:Ranger(16): STR+1, (STR=21)
