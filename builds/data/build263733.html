This class split has done many times before. This is the only one that uses this exact level distribution though. I went with SD 7 to get Slippery Mind to help with the low will save. This is an elven build that doesnt get an xp penalty anywhere in the build. 42 AB, 31 AC, 9d6 sneak attack, 438 hp's (not bad for an elven fighter with 24 total levels of rogue/shadowdancer), Epic Dodge and SC IV. Weapon I chose was the rapier. The only thing I wasnt sure of was how to distribute all the skill points...I tried to get most of the rogue skills to 40, but do they all need to be that high? I think adding set traps would be good, but i'm not sure what is a good number to have all the rogue skills end at?<br><br>Elf<br>Any Alignment<br>1-40 PvM<br><br>STR	10<br>DEX	18 (32)<br>CON	14 <br>WIS	10<br>INT	14<br>CHA	 8<br><br>Saves<br><br>FORT	22<br>REFL	34<br>WILL	18<br><br>AB	42/37/32/27<br>	1-6+6 (15-20/x2)<br>	9d6 sneak attack<br>AC	31<br>HP's	438<br><br>Skill Points (320)<br><br>Disable Trap	38 (40)<br>Discipline	40<br>Hide		43 (54)<br>Move Silently	43 (54)<br>Open Lock	29 (40)<br>Search		36 (40)<br>Tumble		40<br>Use Magic Device41 (40)<br>Points Left	10<br><br>1.

40 UMD is a bit much IMO.<br><br>You could dump your remaining points into Heal, or cross class it into Spellcraft for a few Spell Save points.<br><br>At first I was going to suggest replacing Toughness with Stealthy (for +2 Hide/MS) but 40 HPs might be better.

Looks pretty good.<br><br>As for your skill questions:<br><br>if you're dealing with epic traps, you'll want a modified* score of 42 in Search, 45 in Set Trap, and 38 in Disable in order to guarantee success.<br><br>Add +10 to your Disable skill if you want to recover epic traps.<br><br>If you're not going to be dealing with epic traps, then you can drop the modified scores to:<br><br>Set: 25<br>Disable: 16 (add 10 if you want to recover)<br>Search: 21<br> <br><br>*modified includes your DEX/INT modifiers, skill focus or epic skill focus feats, item/spell boosts, and armor check penalties (if applicable).<br><br>*edit* Other Rogue skills such as Open Lock, Hide, and Move you'll want to keep maxed (assuming you're going for the sneaky Rogue type). UMD is a personal preference and is really dependent on whether your environment is high magic or not. If it's very high magic, then a high UMD is essential. Otherwise, you can cut back on it a bit. Keep in mind that under hardcore rules, you have to pass a UMD check of DC 25 + spell level in order to successfully cast from scrolls, so you'd want a minimum of 33 ranks in UMD in that type of setting.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 01/18/07 20:41</span></i></p>

Not quite sure why I just thought of this, but would it not be better to pick up the dual wield feats and drop Luck of Heroes, Iron Will and Improved Critical? I know that would make my Will save even lower, but is there really much of a difference between 15 and 18? Its terrible either way and could do more damage with the dual wield feats.

Maybe, two weapons will drop your AB by 2, which isn't that high btw, but will grant more APR for sneak damage, it's a thing of taste. Luck of Heroes and Iron Will aren't important at all, I like Improved Critical on my melee builds, but it's not 100% needed if you wish to change it.<br><br>I find Self Concealment excessive, with a good AC, Epic Dodge and UMD, SF IV won't add that much, I'd take DEX instead or drop Fighter for Rogue.

It can make a big difference with IC for example IF you were using kamas vs rapiers.  But BUT with this build the bulk of your damage is going to come from the sneaks, so crit isnt important.  Your comments on the save feats is valid if your intent is to do massive sneak damage.  Dual weilding with a dex of 32 base isnt that high.  Dual weilding dexers can get their dex up to 40 or so so 32 may be seen as low for that.  In the end its up to you.

I initially wanted to keep my AB and Crit Range as high as I could get them, and ofcourse you dont have to dual wield all the time. I've noticed, through reading a lot of posts, that most think its a good idea to dual wield when a good amount of sneak damage is involved. But, that unless using kukris, most think it is a waste to take improved critical with a finessable weapon. Thanks for the replies.

Personally I find Self Concealment a very useless feat, you normally already have Epic Dodge, UMD and lots of AC if you go for it, and Self Concealment I to III get wasted against Blind-Fight, Self Concealment IV gets an effective 16% agains Blind-Fight, plus that Improved Invisibility already gives 50% (25% against Blind-Fight), so you need to aim for Self Concealment V to make it whrothwhile, making it the <b>heaviest</b> feat-stat investment (heavier than even Devastating Critical or Dragon Shape), so I judge it's a bad feat. It will only excell where Improved Invisibility is nerfed or the like.

I would drop SD to 5 and take 2 more Rogue levels. A few more skillpoints, 1d6 more sneak damage, and Rogue 19 gets you a bonus Rogue feat which you can use either for Slippery Mind (which you got with SD7), or for something else (Crippling Strike, Improved Sneak Attack, etc.). <br><br>Personally, given your low Will save, I would take Crippling Strike over Slippery Mind anyway. You will still probably fail the second roll, so just make immunity to mind spell items a priority and focus the feats on offense.<br><br>TM
