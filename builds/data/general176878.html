Hmmm, I am assuming you mean the best for PvP.  Although a pure or near-pure Sorc might be the best for PvP, I'm thinking a hybrid would probably be better in PvM.  <br><br>I recall seeing some builds here that were something like Sorc 26/Cleric 13/Paladin 1, or something along those lines.  Reason a Sorc/Cleric build is probably better than a pure Sorc for PvM is that a Sorc/Cleric can heal themselves, meaning they have much more survivability and they have the potential to do a lot more damage with reciprocal damage spells since they can take so many hits.

sorc35 monk3 blackguard2<br>2 levels monk pre-epic for saves and discipline, one at 40 to finish maxing discipline and listen. Bonus feat cleave from monk qualifies you for blackguard at levels 22 and 39, max taunt to screw up any caster foes and give them a miscast chance. Blackguard also gives you dark blessing at level 2, making you neigh invunerable to any damage from reflex based spells. As for the sorc levels, get the usual metamagic (empower, extend, maximize, quicken)and still have room for autoquicken 3, epic ward and dragon knight to dispatch any nasty sneaks, as well as epic skillfocus in either discipline or listen, depending on if shadowdancers or knockdown spammers are what's going on in your neck of the woods. Spell selection shoud include mords, cloudkill, the bigby family, icestorm, chainlightning, spellmantle, globe of invunerability, gate (and PvE) G-sanc and trueseeing. And dont forget those damage shields! You gotta have the eyeball familliar late in the game for his hella-high save DC rays that disable your opponents and allow you to lesurely choke them to death with anything you want.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Deltutammatre on 01/30/05 07:21</span></i></p>

Sorcerer 38/ Fighter 1/ Rogue 1 or<br>Sorcerer 37/ Blackguard 2/ Bard 1 if you want to get more out of your Charisma.<br>Auto stillspell III enables you to cast everything in fullplate armor and shield. With armor/shield, tumble, epic mage armor and improved expertise your AC can become insane.

To max out tumble, giving you +8 to AC, at least thats why I believe he put it there.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

Boosting your tumble pooches your chances of someone getting an attack of opportunity as you run repeatedly by them, forcing them to smack you with your damage shields (acidsheath, deatharmor, elementalshield) while you take no damage with your epic warding on. AC on a caster?!?! No thank you! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">

Sorc 25/rdd 10/HS 5 however gets the best spell DCs, since a cha of 40 is possible due to the +2 cha from rdd and the HS bonus cha feats.  Also the HS levels allow you to take tumble as a class skill, which is always nice.  <br>I managed to get epic spell focus necromancy and I think most of the spell penetration feats as well as empower and maximise spell last time I made this build.  Although the truly brilliant thing is the sher number of greater missile storms you can cast with empower spell, maximise spell and a natural cha of 40.
