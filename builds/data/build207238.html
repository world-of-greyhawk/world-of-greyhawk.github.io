<b>Playable from level 1-40... PvM build</b><br><br>This build has been sitting on my hard disk for the better part of a year while I was debating whether or not to post it.  I originally created this build in response to the statement that halflings couldn't make effective warriors.  While this Halfling is a proficient warrior, I don't like Halfings and don't think that they should be able to be warriors that are comparable to the larger races.  Hence I was reluctant to post this build.  It works quite well, it has a high AC and a high enough AB that it doesn't have trouble landing knockdown attacks despite its size.  The will and fortitude saves are a bit low, so it has some spell vulnerability there and, like all dex builds, it doesn't do well against critical hit immune opponents.  Against the critical hit vulnerable, it has enough rogue levels that the sneak attack damage is sufficiently lethal and the critical hits do a fair amount of damage as well.  It can't cast spells, but it can use scrolls through UMD and set traps to augment its offensive ability, hence the more magic items it has the better it gets.  This build does the best in low to high magic settings where devastating critical has been disabled.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-High AB. This build has a 46 AB while dual-wielding.  It can hit most opponents.<br>-7D6 sneak attack.  With improved knockdown (which works well due to the high AB) he can create opportunities for many sneak attacks.<br>-Epic Weapon Specialization.  An extra 6 points of damage per hit, really helps out when this build can't rely on critical hits and sneak attacks for damage.  <br>-Epic Dodge and a good AC.  Against most opponents, this halfling is pretty hard to hit.  It can also use expertise to increase the AC a bit more.<br>-Improved Evasion and a High Reflex Save.  He doesn't have to worry about spells with a reflex save for half damage.<br>-High UMD.  He can cast spells from scrolls and wands.<br>-Some Trap Setting Ability. He can use traps to augment his damage. <br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br><br>-Mediocre Fortitude and Will Saves.  He can always use a scroll of mind blank or potion of clarity to help with the will save. The fortitude save is a bit more of a problem, he has to watch out for death magic.  Hopefully he can find some death ward scrolls, or some save boosting items.<br>-Halfling.

Mith, I like the end result, though perhaps it's not the prettiest build in pre-epic, and will definitely have some issues there.  Thus, I see your reluctance in posting it.  He doesn't get his 2nd sneak dice until Level 9, and doesn't get IKD until Lvl 15, and doesn't get to dualwield effectively until Lvl 24, so he more or less is relying on his skills and decent items to save his butt.  This is unavoidable, however, unless you want to completely restructure the design with Rogue-heavy up front and save the bulk of the WM levels for Epic(which would be a differnt concept entirely).  <br><br>What you manage to accomplish, though, are some outstanding AB numbers for a dualwielder by level 40.  It seems that he doesn't really mature until Level 39, when he has both Epic Dodge, ITWF, 7d6 sneak, and daggers x3 crits at a super AB all working at once.  At the loss of 1AB and a WM bonus feat, I would consider dropping 3WM and replacing them with Rogue instead in order to "speed" up the Rogue side of the build and acquiring Epic Dodge sooner.  <br><br>However, for a PvP Lvl 40 build, I'd leave it right where it's at.  <br><br>Thanks for sharing this build.  I think, if anything, it's an exercise and demonstration to stretch the design of classes and races, and a worthy illustration of the costliness of making and playing the Dualwielding, dex-based, weapon master builds.  It requires a special breed of player to have the patience and skill to play one.  I'd take one over a strength-based build anyday.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 08/06/05 01:52</span></i></p>

This is truly a fantastic combination.  If we had a vote for most ingenius concept that is SUCCESSFULLY done, this one should win, hands down!   Who would have ever thought, a mighty halfling meleeist!  Just the thought astounds me!<br><br>I know why i dont do halfs, i would be interested to hear what you dont like in them!  <br><br>Peace

Mith, the only thing I can see which may help the playablility slightly is adjusting where you take those Rogue levels (for Tumble maxing, of course). I'd put them in at levels 7, 12, 17, etc. I don't think it would change anything significant in the build.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
