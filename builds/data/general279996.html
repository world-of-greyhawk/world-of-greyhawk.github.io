I have been testing sneak atk a little and it would seem that it stops at some point by being less effective after a certain amount of sneak atk dmg.<br><br>I made a 31d6 sneaker, 32 str, with a two bladed sword and hit around 120-140 dmg.<br><br>I did the same setup with a 19d6 sneaker and ended up with 80-100 dmg.<br><br>Does someone have more info on this?

Alright. It is because I would like to determine what amount of sneak dmg would be the most effective, so that I would be able to see how much I need of rogue or assassin to achieve that.

Once you get up to 15d6 or so, the real issue becomes sneak resistant enemies. At 15d6 (plus strength and weapon bonuses, etc.), you are already doing so much damage that if you can hit them and they are sneak susceptible you will kill them in just a few hits. It doesn't really matter much if you double the damage at that point - so it only takes 2 hits instead of 4, they are still dead in the first round.<br><br>For the Epic levels, I wouldn't worry about maximizing sneak damage, I would choose based on maximizing bonus feats, skill dumps, AB, and non-sneak damage (i.e. I would take 4 levels of fighter for WS/EWS for 6 base damage over 4 levels of Rogue for 2d6 of sneak damage, even though the 2d6 averages to 7. I would also take 2 fighter levels for Epic Prowess as a bonus feat over 2 Rogue levels for 1d6 more sneak damage, etc.).<br><br>TM
