Each shape has a long range special ability that deals damage, which really helps an otherwise melee only character.  The SR is so high that all level 40 builds will suffer at least a 10% chance of the spell being resisted.  Lack of Spell Penetration Feats or class levels increase this chance even more.  Even a pure wizard will have trouble against the Rakshasa and might even lose in a spell duel.  Multiclasses, like Palemaster are pretty much finished by this shape.  <br>Chaos spittle works well against creatures immune to spells.<br>	If the fight gets to tough the Outside the Natural can run away, unshift and heal.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 05/27/10 21:04</span></i></p>

How do you kill? A lvl five icestorm wont kill a lvl 40 oppponent...and for sure not a mage. Def is uber as rak tho. Why not take undead shape? With that sr crit immy is more useful than the rak spell immy.

Slaad can disarm and take the weapon in a good 4 rounds even on a forced 20 and they regenerate.  Undead shape is rather lacking in abilities, and construct shape has to low of a DR and AC.  I found outsider to work the best of the three.  The main advantage is you have an infinite number (well actually only 200) uses of abilities per shift.

Cool, Rak, and get that it's a theme build which ISR should make for an all the more interesting Rak, and thus a cool addition to a team; though ice storm's a pain, not metamgicked here, and the SR's not that great so don't see how it takes out mages (but a pain, indeed, and the ISR to avoid a lot of spellswords (barring spell pen feats especially), and that's pretty sweet!); as to melee, sorry, Whiz ... not seeing it, as you haven't any AB/damage (relying on a "forced 20"? er, you'll be long gone and buried b/f that, in all pvp environs (and perhaps I'm wrong, but don't imagine there are too many level 40 pvm environs around, but maybe you can enlighten us all as to that)<br><br>As to a lev. 40 rak though w. the ISR trick, along with monk speed, empty body a couple times per day coupled w. monk AC and speed (nice, should at least help avoid say the bolt thing <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     , along w. those immunities is alls in all pretty cool, I agree; should make for a welcome addition to any team: yep, raks are cool, and even nicer w. the speed/empty body thing. <br><br>*edit: as to undeads, well, it's an idea, the scythe lord would buffed bull's w. nat.sense get a 42-ish ab (as I recall), but I'd question 2 shapes so vulnerable let's say to clerics and paladins, plus undeads can't use healing potions, nor can that scythe lord shape make any use whatsoever of the monk's table either (no more than any other armed shape, imo, so the azer chief etc. doesn't either (only unarmed shapes do, imo, such that armed shapes here are limited to 3 apr). Different story for the constructs though, which you may want to rethink since, as unarmed shapes w. some str, can put that monk table to better use, which I think would be cool, and might at times come in handy too, no?

The main problem I had with constructs is the DR was less than +5, meaning that their blows could not penetrate +5 DR.     Their AC is also low allowing more hits to go through and they are severely limited in special abilities (rock throw requires reflex save and poison gas requires two failures on a given poison attempt to kill).  Further no construct has weapon merge which the rak and azer benefit from (allowing their AB and damage to increase in high magic environments), and the iron golem is the only construct with item merge, and there is no construct form with regeneration, in case one needs to run away and heal.<br><br>Outsider seemed the best.<br><br>Remember also that the AC displayed is naked.

No, they don't, Whiz re: stat boosting gear - only the highest one applies, as is true of armor also, and even if can get to AC 70s w. the impr.expertise thing and forgetting about dispel (which dispelling both clerics and pally's do), a ranged pally or cleric in said place don't need no 20, and alls it takes is one bolt; it's your call, though.

Here's what happens when a player shifts into a shape his inventory (for equipment slots) is replaced with an inventory for the shifted shape and the properties of equipped items are copied.  If there is a weapon in the offhand it is ignored.  The properties of the main hand weapon are added to the new weapon (if there is one) and all other properties are added to the creature skin (only helmet, armor and shield if it is an armor merge only).

Yes, Whiz, there is one exception to the general rule regarding weapons (which don't seem to be grouped as part of your hide), as follows:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; Item properties pick the highest one when merging, instead of stacking.

Smiting yes.  But an RDD/Fighter/Sorceror gets 30(BAB) + 3(Focus Feats) + 23(Strength) +5(enhancement) + 1d20 = 61 +1d20, and that's only with half orc.  True strike does up the  AB but it lasts so short that I could run while they cast it and they would lose a spell.  Take Bard instead and it is possible to boost higher, but the builds that can rip apart 77AC usually have to spend their focus almost solely on melee.  Sure I wouldn't stand against them.  But I would stand quite well in melee against a multiclasser mage which was the example given for meleeing.  For RDD/WM builds I would be using icestorm which is I think around 10-15 caster levels by the damage output it is doing.

Yes, as you mentioned this is not a build against everything.  Its closer to a one trick build but having more variety than a stunning fist specialist that is worthless against foes immune to crits.  I see the more variety that one more level of shifter would bring, however, taking that construct shape reduces the SR by 5, which almost makes the SR feats pointless.  The SR increase is as I see it an all or nothing.  I'll admit that 49 is pushing it on the low side but its the highest for an epic shape that I can get.  If I were to take more shifter I would definitely drop the SR for better feats.<br><br>EDIT: To see my SR reasoning consider a mage that can barely penetrate 32 SR on a roll of one (highest toolkit SR).  He then can pierce 49 on a roll of 18.  If my build took one less monk level then the range of SR piercing would be doubled. If another SR feat were replaced the range would almost be triple the original.  I would be stuck fighting them in Rak form, while if I was able to shift to Slaad I could deal them magic damage which they have no protection against.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By WhiZard on 10/03/07 04:27</span></i></p>

My point was that the inventory being replaced is the cause of the momentary stat decrease and not an action of unequipping.  Once you get your new inventory the properties  are then applied to the skin, but there is no reequipping of gear while shifted as many items have their properties converged to one item (the skin) and the ability increase acts as if it were one item rather than many items reequipped.<br><br>Of course this is all technical jargon. Your point about a momentary loss of item properties is correct.

I also agree with Kail. I suspect (have not tested this theory) that any OnEquipp() script on those items would fire if you shift and unshift while it's equipped.

I decided to do a 1.69 revamping.  Not much changes in this build except a greater emphasis on the Rak Shape.  As many previous comments were/are unapplicable I'll list the features that were questioned.<br><br>*Rakasha Shifted spells have a caster level of 25 (the number of monk levels as monk was taken on character level one).<br>*Icestorm has unlimited casting as the Rak shape has a permanent duration.<br>*Item merges (especially immunity to death magic) are critical for this build to avoid blessed bolts.<br>*This form has a +49 bonus to turn resistance, (+24 vs. planar turning), this means that a level 60 monster (higher if not pure cleric) with planar turning would be needed to turn this creature. <br>*Monk speed (80%) when combined with haste is more than 300% normal speed (300% normal speed is twice the speed of a hasted creature).<br><br>Outside the Natural - Druid(5), Shifter(10), Monk(25)<br>Human, Lawful Neutral<br>PvM/PvP, Level 40 Theme Build (Highest SR epic shape)<br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 18 (28)<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 440 Max (336 Average) (Shifts can increase the constitution and add temporary hit points)<br>Skillpoints: 301<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 26/33/20<br>Rakshasa: 28/35/28<br><br>Saving Throw bonuses: +6 vs spells (spellcraft), immunity to mind spells, (+3 vs spells Rakshasa).<br>BAB: 25/22/19/16/13<br>Rakshasa (33/28/23)<br>Ranged AB: 34<br>AC (naked): 31, Rak: 49<br>+3 to AC from barkskin<br>1d4 +1 to strength with bulls strength<br>SR: 49<br>Infinite IceStorm: 10d6 cold, 3d6 bludgeoning, SR penetration: 29 + 1d20.<br>Speed increase: 80%<br><br>SKILLS<br>Animal Empathy 43 (42)<br>Heal 19(28)<br>Lore 43(45)<br>Discipline 43<br>Hide 43(42)<br>Move Silently 43(42)<br>Spellcraft 28(30)  + 15 Rak Shape<br>Tumble 40(39)<br><br>LEVELING GUIDE<br>01: Monk(1): Expertise, Improved Expertise<br>02: Monk(2):<br>03: Druid(1): Spell Penetration<br>04: Monk(3): Wisdom + 1 (19)<br>05: Monk(4):<br>06: Monk(5): Zen Archery<br>07: Monk(6):<br>08: Monk(7): Wisdom + 1 (20)<br>09: Druid(2): Greater Spell Penetration<br>10: Monk(8):<br>11: Monk(9):<br>12: Monk(10): Toughness, Wisdom +1 (21)<br>13: Monk(11):<br>14: Monk(12):<br>15: Druid(3): Brew Potion<br>16: Monk(13): Wisdom +1 (22)<br>17: Monk(14):<br>18: Monk(15): Alertness<br>19: Monk(16):<br>20: Druid(4): Wisdom +1 (23)<br>21 Monk(17): Improved Spell Resistance I<br>22 Monk(18):<br>23 Monk(19):<br>24 Monk(20): ISR II, Wisdom +1 (24)<br>25 Druid(5):<br>26 Shifter(1):<br>27 Monk(21): ISR III<br>28 Shifter(2): Wisdom + 1 (25)<br>29 Shifter (3):<br>30 Monk(22): ISR IV<br>31 Shifter(4):<br>32 Shifter(5): Wisdom +1 (26)<br>33 Monk(23): ISR V<br>34 Shifter(6):<br>35 Shifter(7):<br>36 Monk(24): ISR VI, Wisdom +1 (27)<br>37 Shifter(8):<br>38 Shifter(9):<br>39 Shifter(10): Outsider Shape<br>40 Monk(25): ISR VII, Wisdom +1 (28)<br><br>Changes from previous:<br>Swapped Disarm and Blind Fight (yes the standard must have) for Penetration Feats and Brew Potion (to be used in shifted form).<br><br>Tactics:<br>Run and snipe with ice storm.
