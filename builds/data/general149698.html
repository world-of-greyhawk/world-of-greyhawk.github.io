I wanted to ask every one of you this question.<br><br>How would you all like to make compilation of information on the classes. How they work, what ability do they rely on, what saves do they increase the most, and so on.<br><br>It does not require much work, just post something that would be useful and it could be added to some form of text, such as Abode Reader or Microsoft Works(I perfer this because I don't have any program that makes Abode Reader) and be put up on the vault so everyone can view it and make best build there can be possible.<br><br>And if possible, containing some suggestion, or insider view of the class. Such as this:<br><br>****-This class is best because of it's melee ability against casters.<br><br>****-WOW! I would suggest that you use this class, it gives you amazing ability to overtake the melee characters!<br><br>And stuff like that.<br><br>Personally, there are so much information that is floating around in the site that would contain some useful information about classes. And I would hate to lose that information or can't find it if it is somewhere out there.<br><br>So, what do you all think?<br><br>Anuis

Hmm...I think I'd take archers then, been experimenting with them mostly <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> . I've done some shifters too, but I could more probably use the advice then give it, when it comes to shifters <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Perhaps we could set up a new forum for this, and let every class and/or playing style have a seperate thread. Then we could first post some bits and pieces of what everyone can come up with, and later put it together.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Dimundome on 08/24/04 17:29</span></i></p>

I'm keeping an eye on that one as I go, but it has a lot of mistakes in it as well.  For example, dwarfs don't get their con bonus in any form, but this suggests that it does in at least some.  I'll definitely toss that link in though, the more sources the better.<br><br>Anyway, we probably shouldn't hijack this thread. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif"><br>_________________<br>"Intelligence is knowing a tomato is a fruit; Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad."
