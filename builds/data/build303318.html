Doesn't look too bad, decent ab for a non-Arcane Archer type. The ac is good for plain clothing. Buffs would be dispellable and his damage would suffer a little from low strength. He will fizzle a bit once he runs out of divine damage adders.<br><br>One could somewhat correct this with some strength adding items and a good bow with "Mighty". <br><br>Not much to offer on the feats department as I am still learning from the guru's here in the guild.. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>As a support character I think he would be alright. I wouldn't be running around soloing with this guy at least in some of the PW's I play in. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Thanks for posting, a good submission over all.<br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.

Hello, and welcome to the Guild.  Let's have a look at your build.<br><br>First thing I noticed is that by 20th level you have a 23 Wis and only 6 levels of Cleric and no Monk levels.  That's a lot of Wisdom invested for no return in pre-epic.  I would suggest flip-flopping that and going Cleric18/Ftr2 in pre-epic to make the most of that Wisdom, to open up your spellbook, and rely on Divine Power for a much better AB than you would get with 14 levels of Fighter.   From levels 1-14, you have an 8 strength, and no AC.  You can't wear plate, can't carry a tower shield, and you can't use Expertise with a bow, and you can't even use your Wisdom for AC, and no cleric buffs.  He's going to spend a lot of time taking dirt naps.<br><br>Second Thing:  I'm not sure what the Elf is doing for you in this set-up.  You have a 20% xp penalty in pre-epic, and then that goes to 40% in Epic.  It also give you an inefficient stat spread.  Consider going Human or Half-elf, and maybe even replacing Fighter for CoT.  You'll lose WS/EWS, but the cleric buffs should mitigate that loss.<br><br>Third:  I would drop Combat Casting.  Not going to help this guy.  I would take Greater Spell Penetration in Pre-epic.  EWS: Longbow at level 40 isn't going to help.  A lot of those Fighter levels need to be moved to Epic.  <br><br>Fourth:  Skills, The high Listen is good, but you can stop Tumble at 40.  42 doesn't make a difference.  Because you have a 14Int, you can stop Spellcraft at either 38 or 43.  Your +2 modifier with put it at 40 or 45.  Like Tumble, every 5 modified ranks are what makes the difference.  <br><br>Finally, if I were going to play something like this, I would probably go Cleric26/CoT10/Monk4.  I'd choose human or half-elf to avoid xp penalties and have a stat spread like the following:<br><br>Str14<br>Int12<br>Wis16 <br>Dex14<br>Con14<br>Chr8<br><br>All stat increases would go to Wisdom, and one should end with a final Wisdom of around 34.  Monk levels would be taken at Level 7, 17, 27, 37.  I would go Cleric16/Monk1/CoT3 pre-epic, and then shoot for Cleric25 as soon as possible, and save your last Cleric level for the very end a Great Wisdom Feat.  You CoT feats would go toward EWF, Epic Prowess, Armor Skin, and Great Wis.  Both Cleric bonus feats can go towards Great Wis and you can use one of your general epic feats for your ESF: Listen if you still need that, or you can drop 2 Great Wisdoms for some Epic Spells like Greater Ruin or Mummy Dust.<br><br>That's it.  Needs a bit of an overhaul, but the basics are all there.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Good points Grizz, they would go alot towards a more playable and possibly semi-solo kind of character.<br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.
