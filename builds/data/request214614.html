It seems like these classes have good synergy in attributes &amp; skills. 8 or 9 Kama attacks with ITW &amp; many ways to generate death attackes, IKD, Darkness &amp; Ultravision, Compainon and stealth. <br><br>I like the pre-epic split of M6/R9/A5. Aiming for M9/R9/A22. However I know it has some big cons without Uncanny Dodge or Epic Dodge. <br><br>Would aiming for the SC line be suffiencent? <br><br>Thanks

If I were you I would take fighter levels. 4 fighter levels will give you 3 extra feats (enough for dualwielding), 6 will also give you specialization.<br><br>You can get both 16 BAB and epic weapon specialization (+6 damage per hit) with 6 fighter levels (That leaves same BAB and 3 more levels for assassin). 8 Fighter levels will give you the same as ranger (getting dualwield "for free") plus epic weapon specialization. And 10 fighter levels would give you 1 more BAB, dualwielding and ews.<br>_________________<br>HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh. We are now the Knights Who Say Ekke ekke ekke ptang zoo boing!<br>RANDOM: Ni!

Thanks for the reply. The uncanny dodge issue makes we less fearful of the build.<br><br>I choose Ranger because something inside me thinks fighters levels are too easy a solution. <br><br>With 14 base wisdom and some wisdom + items I should get a couple spells. But maybe I would be better off going M8/F4/A8 pre-epic then M9/F6/A25 for a higher death attach DC.
