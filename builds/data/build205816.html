<b>Playable from level 1-40... PvM</b><br><br>Originally this build was conceived as a D&amp;D version of Nemesis, kind of a bounty hunter/hitman of the gods.  When I built it I was pleased with the end result, it had a good mix of abilities and immunities allowing it to do pretty much everything.  While it wasn't particularly good at anything, it has a pretty strong offence, good buffed AB and a good buffed AC.  It reminded me of what the first build I ever posted was supposed to do, so I made it the update of that build.  This build should do best in a low to mid magic setting.  I see this as more of a solo build than a party build, the lack of focus makes it awkward for a party setting where a specialist is required.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-Devastating Critical with a 39 DC.  Always nice to be able to bump off your enemies on a crit.<br>-High Fortitude Save.  His fortitude save is high enough that he should have a good chance of saving against Dev. crit.<br>-Level 4 Paladin Spells.  He has some good buffing spells.<br>-High Taunt Skill.  He has a fair AB and with his buffs he can get it fairly high, but if that still is not enough he has taunt.<br>-5D6 sneak attack with crippling strike.  If his opponents are saving against devastating critical, he can knockdown them down and sap their strength.  It will also help him save against opponents with Dev. Crit. and lower the AB of STR fighters.<br>-Divine Might and Divine Shield.  He can do divine damage to his opponents or buff his AC.   Buffed it only lasts 8 rounds, but that can be all you need.<br>-High UMD skill.  He can use scrolls or magical equipment meant for other classes.<br>-Evasion and a good reflex save.  He can avoid damage from any spells with a reflex save for half damage.<br>-Immune to Fear and a good will save.  Mind spells have a low chance of affecting him.<br>-Good trap setting ability.  He can't set epic traps but anything less is possible.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br><br>-Short lived buffs.  Divine Might and Divine shield don't last that long.<br>-Doesn't really excel at anything.  He's pretty competent at everything he does and he can do pretty much anything.  However, anything he does, there is another build that does it better.  Because of this he wouldn't really fit into party.<br>-No stealth skills.  He would be a good scout if he had these skills, he can use potions/scrolls of invisibility but it isn't the same.<br><br><b>Generalist V. 2</b> <br><br><i>Race</i> Human<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Lawful Good<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 14<br>DEX 8<br>CON 14<br>WIS 14<br>INT 14<br>CHA 14<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>All 10 bonuses go to STR<br><br><i>Leveling Guide</i><br>Level 1: Rogue<br>Levels 2-5: Paladin<br>Level 6: Rogue<br>Levels 7-10: Paladin<br>Level 11: Rogue<br>Levels 12-15: Champion of Torm<br>Level 16: Rogue<br>Levels 17-20: Paladin<br>Level 21: Rogue<br>Levels 22-25: Champion of Torm<br>Level 26: Rogue<br>Levels 27-30: Champion of Torm<br>Level 31: Rogue<br>Levels 32-33: Champion of Torm<br>Level 34: Rogue<br>Level 35-36: Paladin<br>Level 37: Rogue<br>Level 38: Paladin<br>Level 39: Rogue<br>Level 40: Paladin<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Champion of Torm 14<br>Paladin 16<br>Rogue 10<br><br><i>Feats</i><br>Level 1: Power Attack, Knockdown <br>Level 3: Weapon Focus (Scimitar)<br>Level 6: Cleave<br>Level 9: Divine Might<br>Level 12: Improved Knockdown<br>Level 13: Improved Critical (Scimitar)<br>Level 15: Blind-Fight, Great Cleave<br>Level 18: Divine Shield <br>Level 21: Epic Fortitude<br>Level 23: Epic Weapon Focus (Scimitar)<br>Level 24: Great Strength I<br>Level 25: Epic Prowess<br>Level 27: Great Strength II<br>Level 28: Overwhelming Critical (Scimitar)<br>Level 30: Great Strength III <br>Level 33: Great Strength IV, Devastating Critical (Scimitar) <br>Level 36: Epic Skill Focus (Taunt)<br>Level 39: Epic Will, Crippling Strike<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 28<br>DEX 8<br>CON 14<br>WIS 14<br>INT 14<br>CHA 14<br><br><i>Hit Points</i> (max every level) 440<br><br><i>Final Saves</i> (Vs.

Nice build Mith.  Just wondering about a few things.<br><br>Why do you take a single point in disable trap?  It is (probably) not enough to disarm anything beyond a simple trap, which using the bonuses from charisma and uncanny dodge can be avoided on a reflex throw.  Also, without points into search, you won't see the trap until your on top of it anyways.  Does disarm trap have another use which I completely glossed over in my zeal?<br><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Tumble 40 (43) (Tu)<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I don't understand what the second number means.  Do you mean that you put 43 points into tumble?  But then, with your dex mod, you would get 42, not 40.  And if you put 40 points into tumble, you would end with 39, not 43.  Just as a side question, do you lose the last (8th) point to AC if your tumble finishes at 39 but you put 40 points into it?<br><br>Very versatile character, especially considering the small selection of spells.<br><br>-C<br>_________________<br>"Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger."

As long as you have 40 skill ranks in tumble you get the plus 8.  UMD and spell craft are dependent on your modified score.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Cin got it right, as usual.  I prefer the other Paladin level for spells that last slightly longer and the extra second level spell (which could be an Eagle's Splendor, Bull's Strength, Aura of Glory, or Aid).  The Divine Wrath is okay, but at 8 rounds (with a buffed CHA) a day (Divine Shield and Might last the same but I get multiple uses) I prefer the extra Paladin Level.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

There is something uncannily synergestic about a Rogue/Paladin character.
