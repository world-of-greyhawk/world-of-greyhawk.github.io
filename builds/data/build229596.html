Her name is Shay.  She's an Ongoing RP build I have for a server I play at.  Theres some minor Changes.  In the RP version I went Charisma: 12, Constitution: 12, Intelligence: 10.<br>I also went to Level 9 Druid, even though I don't get spells for that level, the Immunity to Poison was well worth it.  Then I went straight to Black Gaurd.  Getting two of them in before my level 12 Rogue, which gives me 3 AC Points and a Higher Crit Range.  Though, I can bump my strength by 10, which is a useful RP tool.<br>Playable 1-40 PvM<br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Neutral Evil<br><br>Starting: Druid<br><br>Str: 16<br>Dex: 12 <br>Con: 14 <br>Wis: 14<br>Int:12<br>Cha: 8<br><br><br>Leveling<br><br>1 Druid: Power Attack, Cleave<br>2 Druid<br>3 Druid: Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>4 Druid: Strength (+1)<br>5 Druid<br>6 Druid: Knockdown<br>7 Druid<br>8 Rogue: Strength (+1)<br>9 Rogue: Toughness<br>10 Rogue: Hide (+5)<br>11 Black Gaurd (Here you'll Switch to Full Plate)<br>12 Black Gaurd: Strength (+1), Improved Critical: Scimitar.

not too bad, but i think that using a higher charisma would be a good idea here.  the advantage would be negating the -1 to saves from your charisma.  if it was put up to 12 as in your original build, you would gain +2 to saves. of course you would lose some skills and hitpoints, so i dunno if that is worth it.  just something to keep in mind.<br><br>otherwise that is a pretty interesting build.<br><br>-c

I think it's a good build, although I don't really like scimitars... but it's your call.<br><br>Exactly how high is your sneak attack?<br><br>Don't rely on those companions, a level 7 bear is dead meat, since bears always have a low AC, level 9 Summoned Doom Knight doesn't work on high levels, the epic fiendish servant might end up strong, but not something that would be very surprising, I think Epic Summons (like mummy dust) are stronger, although those are out of your classes.<br><br>....you forgot to tell the HP.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/07/06 23:56</span></i></p>

Well, You'll have a sneak of 7d6.<br><br>And, you don't need your companion for long.  Just long enough to hold down your enemy until you can get some sneak and criticals in.  Get that flanking 2 ab.<br><br>This technique of course won't work with PC's, just NPC's.<br><br>And, I actually don't know how to Calculate HP.  Call me a greenhorn, but I've never read where all the DC's where.<br><br>Though, She has a good 300 I believe.  I don't know what Max is. *Shrugs*<br>_________________<br>~Blake~
