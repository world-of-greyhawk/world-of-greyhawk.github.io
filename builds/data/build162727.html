Because I need a 13 for power attack and a 13 for Expertise.<br><br>You could raise those if you want...I would suggest raising strength...it get overridden when you shift...there is no need for more, but there is a minimum need of 13 in both.  <br><br>I feel it's has enough skill points, but if you want more then sacrifice some Con/Chr.  Tumble Hide MoveSilent Discipline SpellCraft are basiclly maxed. I don't really care about any other skills.  I put 1 point into openlocks just so that I could open locks....in dragon form that one point turns into 15.  I had a couple of other free points...I also put 1 into disable traps which turns into 15.

This is a dumb question, but why not take fighter levels instead of Champion of Torm? The fighter levels give you weapon specialization unarmed strike (epic specialization too if you micromanage some feats) and lets you focus in unarmed strike which helps your dragon. The CoT levels give +2 to saves and some charisma based abilities, but with 12 charisma there isn't much to be gained by them anyway.

I have to agree that you aren't taking full advantage of CoT. You could of taken every level post epic and used used the bonus feats from the class for great wisdom . You also could probably live with a lot less monk levels. Personally I would look at going with only enough monk levels to get improved knockdown and then putting the rest to CoT. This would net you a lot more feats and probably access to dragon shape a lot earlier.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

I want 50% concealment because I get sick of boss monsters on PW's that have Dev Crit.  Sometimes a boss is too much for my elemental forms, or I just want to stay a Dragon, to handle so I figured it's real hard for them to dev crit me if they right off the bat have a 50% chance to miss me.  So basiclly it's a way to help keep alive as an elemental.  Plus it will also help the Dragon out.  noting like a 80 - 90 ac and 50% concealment.<br><br>Edit...added P.S.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By WarriorCleric on 11/04/04 00:37</span></i></p>

The power attacks also help you do damage against creatures that have high damage reduction.  IKD will work with both of those feats running...it's not 1 or the other.  IKD should be spammed out on all attacks..unless you are fighting something of equal size.  If equal size do it untill they are knocked down then attack regular.

Actually I've never played CoT except as a melee type so I didn't realise it was needed.<br><br>I play on lots of PWs, but perhaps they're not the same as yours as I've never had bosses so tough that putting in Improved PA would have improved my damage. I understand that it will work for you if you only hit them on a 20.<br><br>Improved Expertise, OTOH, only works if you can hit them easily, but they can also hit you easily. If it worked while you cast spells it would be a useful feat, but as it stands I can't see why you would take it. If you get a KD then the other side can't attack you, why would you greatly reduce the chances to get that hit? OK, it might (not that I really believe this - I find Druids really easy to play early on) have some benefit early on as a purely defensive measure, but it has no use in the long run, so I feel sure that there are better uses for two feats.<br><br>Only reason I can see for going to Druid 18 is to get more spells, you only need 13 levels for Dragon, so that's why I suggested spell-related feats. Maybe, instead you should replace some Druid levels by Monk ones - I don't see many buffs in the level 8 &amp; 9 spells.<br><br>Is there any benefit of taking the Monk levels so early on? I know it get's you an extra Tumble AC each time, but at the expense of spell progression and your animal companion. Alternatively you could start Monk, seeing as you don't get the Dragon shape till level 33.<br><br>Another thought - if you take some CoT levels post Epic, won't that give you extra feats?<br><br>P.S. I'm not trolling for a fight. TBH I just feel that this build is not quite right.

It really depends on where you play.  I play on 2 servers, 1 that you can get to 40 in maybe a month of hard playing and the other.. it is nearly impossible(has never been done).  If the lvling is slow, then you would want to get dragonshape as soon as possible.<br><br>Feats like epic weap foc and epic prowess DO help unarmed ab when in dragonshape.  I would highly recommend them.<br><br>Another important thing to know is how often you can rest. 2 uses of empty body for 18 rounds is not that great when you need 10 mins to rest.  What kind of AC can you get on your build on the server you play?  Mine has armor skin and 90+ ac with merging a +5 armor, +5 shield, and maybe a helm with +3 deflection.  Not sure you'd need 50% conceal.. plus the dragon now has 40/+6 DR.. that will be hard to break through.<br><br>For druid buffs you will want max/emp bulls, aura of vitality, and maybe blood frenzy.  I was able to find a shield with +3 str and that will merge too.  So you could take more druid lvls actually for better duration and makes it harder for you to be dispelled.  Also have to take into acct owls insight(by lvl 24 it gives a full +12 to wisdom) The point may be to go dragonshape but with the high wisdom you will get some nice magic to use.<br><br>Personally, I am a fan of the 20 druid/10 cot/10 monk, 26 druid/ 8 COT/ 6 monk, or maybe even a 28 druid/ 10 CoT/ 2 monk.  These builds can buff to 80 ac.. with items this can get boosted a little more.  One server I play on allows the ac bonuses to stack from merged items.  The default somehow makes them all deflection and they wouldn't stack.<br><br>I kinda like the shifter build too as the dragonbreath can deal 100+ dmg.. though I think the DC sucks.. <br><br>So my point is.. it just depends...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DeathScytheDuo on 11/05/04 16:16</span></i></p>

If it worked while you cast spells it would be a useful feat, but as it stands I can't see why you would take it. If you get a KD then the other side can't attack you, why would you greatly reduce the chances to get that hit? OK, it might (not that I really believe this - I find Druids really easy to play early on) have some benefit early on as a purely defensive measure, but it has no use in the long run, so I feel sure that there are better uses for two feats.<br><br>Only reason I can see for going to Druid 18 is to get more spells, you only need 13 levels for Dragon, so that's why I suggested spell-related feats. Maybe, instead you should replace some Druid levels by Monk ones - I don't see many buffs in the level 8 &amp; 9 spells.<br><br>Is there any benefit of taking the Monk levels so early on? I know it get's you an extra Tumble AC each time, but at the expense of spell progression and your animal companion. Alternatively you could start Monk, seeing as you don't get the Dragon shape till level 33.<br><br>Another thought - if you take some CoT levels post Epic, won't that give you extra feats?<br><br>P.S. I'm not trolling for a fight. TBH I just feel that this build is not quite right.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I like IE...it comes in very handy.  There are times I don't want to attack, but also don't want to hit anything so I'll activate it.  Like breathing or casting a spell(not if dform) or calling a companion.  You can also turn it on when running thru an area to give you that 10 ac bonus.  You can...start running, then activate it while running and it stays on.  Or turn it on and click on a chest or a dorr or a enemy and it stays on while you move thru a danger zone.  My main reason for it is obviosly defense.  If I have a ridiculous AC then maybe I live much because I hit the boss every so often while he whiffs.  My style of play with this kind of character is probably different then others.  I don't ever play in natrual form...I only play in shapes.  So the only thing I use spells for is pre battle buffs.<br><br>The build is called the Order of the Dragon because it's designed around my cultist view towards the Dragon form.<br><br>If you can design a better melee Dragon please do.  I would love to see it.  It's too bad DCrit doesn't work in DForm...I tested it with a Druid/Wiz/RDD.  I do not know if overwhelming works or not.<br><br>I bet the Barb rage feats would work, but I don't know if you could get them and dform.  A 25 strength and 30 wiz without RDD would be tuff.<br><br>As far as I am concerned all shapshifter builds that require a high Wisdom should have Monk.  It's just silly not to get that AC bonus.<br><br>Please post your own Dragon build...the more there are to look over the better.<br><br>I really like the Puff builds....I wish leveling tables were available for all 3 versions.

No there's no point in Barbarian as you need Wis 25 and Str 25. Maybe you could get there as a Half-Orc, but you would not only sac too much else, but you would get no benefit to the Str in Dragon form. Can't be worth it.<br><br>I see your points on IE, but when you have a Monk, you don't usually have to worry about travelling around. In fact my last Monk build hardly got hit at all. Still, lots of people seem to like IE, so I must be wrong.<br><br>I don't think I've seen a better melee Dragon than the Dragon Savant build. DD as the third class makes a lot of sense. Still not up to Puff tho' - Epic Warding is one hell of a spell.

The feat is bugged in NWN because when casting you are flat footed, and in pnp IE won't give you a bonus when flat footed (no DEX either). In NWN you do not lose the IE defense while casting liek you should. Hence like I stated in another thread, you get 10 AC at virtually no cost to offense when you use it while casting.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Ah, that explains it then . Someone should make a list of all these advantageous bugs in NWN... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Still, as a Sorc with Mestils/DA/ES up and running, I often want to get a bit (as long as they don't do too much damage, which is generally the case unless they have dev crit and I'm not immune).
