Blissful Silence Assassin 30 / Rogue 10<br><br>Repercussion n.: 1: (often followed by of) an indirect effect or reaction following an event or action. 2: the recoil after impact. 3: an echo or reverberation.<br><br>Silence is blissful, is it not? The ever so serene and beautiful sound of nothingness is interrupted by not even a sudden gasp of terror, not a murmur or a harsh rasp of breath on the back of the neck of the night. <br><br>I live deep within the shadows; I stalk your every move. You don't know I am here and you think you are the only one. You spit your vengeance and rage unto the world in which you despise and you throw yourself into the vile deception of this broken world in which you hide behind. I creep along ever so silently behind you, watching you, stalking you waiting for just the perfect moment to make my first move.<br><br>I have a very short fuse that has been lit by you; I am something that wishes not to be played with nor hunted, a dangerous little thing with a very bad attitude. I hunt you down and find you and I invade your every last thought your fears and all your weaknesses.<br><br>I watch you from a far; alone I sit within the shadows and watch patiently I do. I smile to myself as I watch, I know what's coming your way, and I know what it is that's coming to get you someday.<br>  <br>As the day turns to night I prepare to come and visit you as you sleep, I get inside your thoughts and I tell your brain what to show you. I tell it to show you haunting images of the dead in which you have tortured and shredded. I show you the nightmares of a time and place not yet seen by you nightmares of a figure known as me coming to get you. I move in closer to you, I sit beside you as you sleep. <br><br>As I look around and plot my plans for you I can hear the beating of your heart, I can smell the fear all over you, my finger nails grow, my eyes turn to a fire red and my teeth become fangs. I send you images of wanting to tear the flesh right from your bones, just rip it off and burn it to dust. I send to you an image of myself so you can see exactly what's coming, so you can get a small clue of who and what has been stalking you <br><br>You awaken in a deep cold and terrifying sweat with the feeling of something else being with you. The hair arises to its end on the back of your neck as you look around and you see nothing <br>you see what I want you to see. <br><br> sssshhhhh............. <br><br>There’s something out there. Out in the same forest in which you travel alone, try to find me, try to seek me out and hunt me down. I control your every thought, your every feeling and the nightmares of me in which you have in your precious sleep is only the beginning of that in which I plan on doing to you. <br>  <br>I am gonna take all your sleepless nights and very much turn to them into the darkest of all days. The visions of an impending doom follow you through your journeys, they taunt you, they laugh at you, and you look down and see you have a present from me all over your arms. Scratches that tell you of a future to come for you, the present from me to you. A mere shadow as to who it is that you attacked for no reason. Mere images turn to reality of who is coming back for you. <br><br>Hear me whisper to you in your ears, turn around and find that there is no one there, feel my breath upon the back of your neck. Shiver and try to run away from the fear of doom, hide like always, and hide in the darkness in which you call your reality. I will find you. I will hurt you for every little thing you've done to others through anger and rage, I will give back to you, your evil little ways shall crumble to the dirt in which you shiat and your vile little world of deception and torture shall perish unto the dark abyss in which it is that you crawled out from. <br><br>I can see you.<br> <br> I am behind you.<br><br>Moving in closer and closer towards you and ready to make my move. I let you feel my breath and I let you turn to see me. You beg and plead for mercy and beg of me not to show you my sadistic ways. You scream for help from all your new breed friends to come and help you scream but no one hears. Now it's my turn to show you just how far my boundaries really do go and just how close to the limits of the damned you are to facing your reality, your new reality which is me! <br><br><br>This build is for the Pure Prestige Build Guild, but I was unsure of how to submit it to that specific area.

I'd really suggest starting with 14 con instead of 14 str.<br><br>With 240 base hit points, another 80 is rather massive...and 2 damage won't mean much on a build like this.

Ahh nuts.  10/30 WASNT the point of the "pure PRC" builds we did so many moons ago.  It was to capture the ESSENCE of the PRC class.  One dude did the Pure build thing with 4 or 6 DIFFERENT base classes claiming each was the WAY you used the PRC!  LOl <br><br>While this build is fine, something glaringly obvious hits me smack in the face and i cannot say that this is THE assassin build (which is really the whole point).  Assassin DOESNT qualify for ED, so does that mean that using DEXTERITY is the way to go for the build?  I dont think it does.  <br><br>I know the CONCEPT of your build is silence, so dex is obvious, but that means you need to rethink the class lvls.   Without ED all the dex can go to waste easily and quickly (you only get uncanny 2).  SO, in order to make this legit (in terms of being a REPRESENTATIVE build), maybe r13/ass27 is more in line, so you can get ED.  I know you're thinkin that it isnt pure!  well it is, infact. You are using your concept and making it even better by adding THE feat.  <br><br>For the purests, i would even go ass26/r13/SD1 for TOTAL silence (the power in me).  <br><br>You have to remember, that whole period of time in the guild was very exciting.  There was ALOT of discussion on this topic and 10/30 is generally thought of as the easy way but not the correct way.  The whole pure PRC thing will never be fully put to rest cuz there ISNT a pure ANYTHING!  WHile one guy would use Dex for rogues, i have ALWAYS loved str rogues!  While some say the High Wisdom cleric is THE cleric, i have mostly done 19/20wisdom Str clerics!  Who's right?  BOTH!  Going 10/30 ONLY shows you can count.  It doesnt show us your creativity OR the essence of the PRC the way YOU see it (cuz thats what we want to see). <br><br>And PLEASE!!!  stop these silly pure prcs!  You will NEVER get a concensus and they only end up with feelings hurt!  <br><br>And for the record, the CONCEPT your story would BEST be suited by the ass26/sd1/r13 build vs what you gave, imvho.   Just think on it.  When you are ready to POST, you put them in the Epic Character builds forum (2nd from top).  There is no separate one for the PRC experiment!<br><br>Oh, and IF you make this dude a Dwarf you could enter it into the Dwarf Assassin's Guild!

NO problems at all.  This whole topic is very controversial, and arguments can be made for almost any variant as being a pure one.  <br><br>Just make builds you like and RP and post them in the 2nd forum.  They will be dealt with as needed  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    jk

... What is a Pure Build?<br><br>-Too philosophical, is this really Thax talking?-<br><br>Well, I say a Pure Build is a character draft for a character who has only one class for no other purpose than "because the builder wanted", while blatantly ignoring all possible benefits that come from multiclassing. So, if you want to make a Prestige Class Build as Pure as the game allows you to, go ahead, but Pure building goes against the tenets of powerbuilding, and so Pure builds are weak. If you can live with that, then use Pure Builds and be happy. My recommendation is, as always, screw that, and make your builds without those subjective conceptual restrictions.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 11/30/09 00:48</span></i></p>

A) In my experience, a PrC build is considered 'pure' if it contains the maximum allowable levels of that class.  Hence, yes, you'd need to have 30 assassin levels to be a 'pure' build.<br><br>B) I find the whole thing very ridiculous, for reasons outlined by previous posters here, and in other threads, but others in the guild have disagreed and it seems to be considered by some to be a legitimate pursuit, so... c'est la vie.  Cosi sia.<br><br>C) Assuming this hasn't been done (I didn't check), the Epic Character Builds forum is still the appropriate spot for this, regardless of purity, or lack there of.<br><br>D) We wonder if such a build might just be better off STR based... worth a shot, eh?  Meh, probably too many problems involved, but still, aint doin' a whole lot bein' DEX based.

Yeah onion, lots of different ideas here.  PRC is meant as an enhancer, not the be all end all of a build, at least thats the most useful way i have figured out over the years.<br><br>The problem with taking a PRC, like assassin, and trying to make a "iconic" build is that most end up doing DEX, when the class tells you DEX ISNT the way to go (not getting feats for ED is a clear give away).  That said, doing a dex assassin ISNT wrong either.  <br><br>I have figured that there is no such thing as an iconic (or pure) PRC, no matter what the class split.  Look at a recent 8pal/2bg/30 COT that was done.  How on earth is that iconic, yet it would be, by the ridiculous definition.  <br><br>The whole point that i have tried to do in building was take an idea and turn it into the most for what your idea is.  Dont ever let a class split dictate your ideas.

Dexterity gives bonus to Hide and Move Silently, so I figure Assassins should have a high DEX score if you pretend to hit Death Attacks, which is the big ability of the class. There are other reasons other than Epic Dodge to go DEX based avado, you should know that.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 01/18/10 02:54</span></i></p>

Just like Dev Crit is more exclusive than Power Attack.  Being more exclusive doesn't necessarily mean it's powerful, just that it's more exclusive.<br><br>It also cannot be replaced by a simple spell or scroll or wand.  Its effect can be simulated temporarily and to the degree that it tends to be functionally identical, but SC V still has the advantages of being non-dispellable and permanent.

IT had to do with NOT qualing for ED on its own, which lead me to suggest that MAYBE, it ISNT a dex based class, while magi suggested that, since SC IS a feat selectable that it should be a dex based iconic class.  <br><br>The whole thing is moot, which was my point, cuz FEAT selection, esp Epic Bonus feat selection really ISNT a determining factor as to how a class should be played.  IF it were, even though 99% or RDD builds stop at 10 lvs, the Epic bonus feats are all Caster feats, which makes me wonder why there arent more RDD pure casters? <br>If there is ONE I bet that the char is played as a meleer.  This whole thing is the reason why, even though it was a good idea, we stopped it (or was it that one guy posted 4 totally different Iconic SD builds..?  Maybe both).  <br><br>Oh, and the whole point of an Iconic build IS that there is only ONE option, which is why i hated the whole thing in the first place!  So YES, any arguing on the topic IS moronic, and magi and I are the kings of moronic for even attempting to discuss such a silly discussion in the first place.
