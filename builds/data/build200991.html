<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>This is my first cleric, I never play magic casters (I have only played one on my lifetime, and I liked it), so I decided to play a cleric, as I am not much of an experienced casting-class-player, I decided to give him enough melee presence to make him to perform the most close to a fighter even if unbuffed and, still, have good enough casting abilities.<br><br>This is what I came up with:<br><br>(I bet there are lots of builds like this one and I am sorry if it is repeated or done to death.)<br><br><br>Cleric(20), Fighter(10), Champion of Torm(10), Non-Evil Human<br><br>Note: He also could be Dwarf by throwing a single feat (Blind fight, empower spell, IKD... up to you), it would benefit of the Con bonus with 40 more HP or throwing those two extra ability points into dex for 1 more AC and reflex saves.<br><br>STR: 16 (30)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 16 (20)<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>01: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Greatsword, Power Attack, Cleave, Disable Trap(2), Discipline(4), Open Lock(2)<br>02: Fighter(2): Knockdown<br>03: Fighter(3): Blind Fight<br>04: Fighter(4): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Greatsword, (STR=17)<br>05: Cleric(1)<br>06: Cleric(2): Extend Spell<br>07: Cleric(3): Concentration(10), Spellcraft(10), Tumble(5)<br>08: Champion of Torm(1): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>09: Champion of Torm(2): Improved Knockdown, Improved Critical: Greatsword, Discipline(5)<br>10: Cleric(4): <br>11: Cleric(5)<br>12: Cleric(6): STR+1, Empower Spell, (STR=19)<br>13: Cleric(7)<br>14: Cleric(8): Spellcraft(5)<br>15: Cleric(9): Maximize Spell<br>16: Cleric(10): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>17: Cleric(11): Concentration(10), Tumble(5)<br>18: Cleric(12): Great Cleave, Spellcraft 5)<br>19: Champion of Torm(3): Disable Trap(5), Open Lock(5)<br>20: Fighter(5): STR+1, (STR=21), Discipline(5)<br>21: Fighter(6): Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword, Epic Weapon Specialization: Greatsword, Discipline(10)<br>22: Fighter(7)<br>23: Fighter(8): Epic Prowess<br>24: Fighter(9): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR=23)<br>25: Champion of Torm(4): Overwhelming Critical: Greatsword<br>26: Champion of Torm(5)<br>27: Champion of Torm(6): Great Strength II, Great Wisdom I, (STR=24), (WIS=17), Tumble(5)<br>28: Fighter(10): STR+1, Devastating Critical: Greatsword, (STR=25), Discipline(5)<br>29: Champion of Torm(7): Open Lock(3)<br>30: Champion of Torm(8): Great Strength III, Great Wisdom II, (STR=26), (WIS=18)<br>31: Cleric(13): Concentration(10), Spellcraft(10)<br>32: Cleric(14): WIS+1, (WIS=19), Spellcraft(5)<br>33: Cleric(15): Great Strength IV, (STR=27)<br>34: Cleric(16)<br>35: Cleric(17)<br>36: Cleric(18): WIS+1, Great Strength V, (STR=28), (WIS=20)<br>37: Cleric(19): Concentration(10), Spellcraft(5), Tumble(5)<br>38: Champion of Torm(9): Discipline(5), Open Lock(1)<br>39: Champion of Torm(10): Great Strength VI, Armor Skin, (STR=29), Discipline(8)<br>40: Cleric(20): STR+1, (STR=30), Concentration(3), Spellcraft(3)<br><br><br>(The following information belongs to an unbuffed character)<br>Skills:<br>Concentration 43(44)<br>Discipline 42(52)<br>Spellcraft 43(45)<br>Tumble 20(19)<br><br>Disable Trap 9(11)<br>Open Lock 12(11) //Trickery will help here<br><br>Saves:<br>Fort: 31 (40 vs spells)<br>Will: 30 (39 vs spells)<br>Ref: 22 (31 vs spells)<br><br>Naked AC = 10(Base) -1(8 dex) +2(Armor skin) +4(tumble) = 15AC<br>AB: 27(Base) + 10(str) +1(WF) +2(EWF) +1(Epic Prowess) = 41AB <br>Damage: 2d6 +15(10str * 1.5) +2(WS) +4(EWS) = 2d6 +21<br>Dev.Crit. DC: 40<br><br>Max HP: 400<br><br>Preferred (for me) Domains: Trickery and Magic - Mostly for their deffensive buffs.<br><br>Other domains:<br>Animal: A good alternative, better summons, and cat's grace to make up your 8 AC<br>War: Could be good too, its special feature wont last long enough (5 - 1 rounds?) but you have it and Cats grace too.<br>Healing: I really like this domain, take it if you want to be more of a support character or if your server has lots of undead *grins*.<br>Travel: Would be useful for servers NO haste items (at all). Else I dont find it very useful.<br><br>About the spell selection... No idea, I have never played cleric, I am open to know which buffing, summoning, and offensive spells I could use on this build. I think that all possible buffs and a few healing spells. And for offensive: Harm(we all know why) and some Area spells to soften rooms.<br><br>I hope you like it. Tweaks?

The skills are a bit messed.<br>I try to take them 5 by 5 in order to improve readability, but I took did it wrong:<br><br>I was taking 5 Spellcraft at level 19 (CoT), move it to level 18(cleric).<br><br>Also 5 discipline at level 10(cleric), it should be at level 9 (CoT).<br>_________________<br>Over Seven Years of High Quality RP. <a href="http://www.mytharria.org" target="_blank">www.mytharria.org</a> We offer a unique world with player based religions &amp; governments.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By fernandooa on 06/23/05 10:19</span></i></p>

I finally though that maximized endurance would do a great make up for the lack of toughness (Good boost and last long).
