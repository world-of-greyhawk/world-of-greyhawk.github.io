Nobody creates good monks anymore. Whenever you see a monk its either attacked with 12 attacks per round, or a dragon. No sane person can level those characters up in a PW.<br><br>So here I am requesting a monk build with<br><br>- No Kamas<br>- No Cheese<br>- No Dragon<br>- Preferably Pure Monk<br><br>Thats all I need, except ofcourse here are the server restrictions.<br><br>- Can't have 2 prestige classes<br><br>Its not much to ask, all it needs is relatively good defense, and isnt to weak at level 1-5 (those are the long levels).<br><br>Thanks<br><br>-EDIT-<br><br>I also must mention that the only reason I want monk is because I just downloaded <br><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Models.Detail&amp;id=124" target="_blank">Hands</a><br><br>and <br><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Models.Detail&amp;id=13" target="_blank">Alternate Combat Animations</a><br><br><br>anyways thanks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>They were all dead.

Unless you're making a SR monk, there's no reason to take a ton of monk levels - monks gain all their class abilities by level 20, then have a very weak epic bonus feat progression.  <br><br>The short version is that after monk level 20 you are better off switching to another class - such as COT, rogue, fighter, blackguard, or even paladin or cleric.<br><br>Here are a couple build ideas from my stable you might find interesting:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "242679", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Fist of Torm</a> 25 monk/5 rogue/10 COT strength build.<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "216179", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Master of the Whirling Blade</a> 20 monk/7 fighter/13 WM.

Search for some Monk/DD and Monk/RDD builds, too. And then there are DEX based Rogues and SDs for multiclassing. As Xylo says, there's no point in going pure Monk, save for SR.<br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a>

Is it even possible to make a monk that isn't cheese?  The whole class is cheese, the insane number of attacks, all three saves with high progressin, immune to virtually eveything and bonus combat feats.  That said, monk/sorc/PM or monk/CoT/rogue are also good builds.  Unless you are going for SR, there isn't any point to taking more than 20 levels, they get nothing in epic levels.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Heh, who says only dragons and dual-wielding high APR is what monk gives? some builds use Monk to get Improved Evasion (sometimes for Epic Dodge), some others to get IKD, and some other for skilldump, since Monk comes with Cleave + Evasion (even if you fight with a Greatsword and Heavy armor), so it has several uses, if this are cheesy then all my following post is useless.<br><br><i>Define "cheese" please</i>.

Couple of suggestions:<br><br>Monk 30/Fighter 4/CoT 6 - str-based, gets WS/EWS, unarmed, excellent saves. Search for my Temple Guardian for an example.<br><br>Monk 35/Fighter 5 - str based, as above, not as many bonus feats, slightly more speed/AC/SR.<br><br>Monk 30/SD 5/Fighter 5 - dex-based, gets ED, WS/EWS, HiPS. You didn't say if SD was allowed on the server, if not you can do the same with a Monk 25/Rogue 10/Fighter 5, with some sneak damage and a few more skillpioints thrown in. Could also do Monk 30/Rogue 10, but no WS/EWS and 1 less attack.<br><br>Monk 40 - I recommend str-based, since pure monks can't get ED. Also slightly tight for feats, so str-based saves you from wasting one on Weapon Finesse.<br><br>Monk 25/Sorc 1/RDD 14 - Go Monk 20 pre-epic. Gets lots of str, excellent AC, RDD immunities. Can optionally take 5 Sorc levels and only 10 RDD, but I don't really recommend it. Your buffs will be pitiful, you are better off using scrolls and wands to buff.<br> <br>TM

IMHO monk is cheese.  THere is no other reason to use a monk!!   Its like not using Rogue for sneaks or tumble or umd.  OR fighter for feats and ws/ews, cot for feats and gr wis, wm for the crit range or multi or ab boost.  Its not using rdd for the free stats.  Or pm for the ac boosts or low qualy for epic spells.  Or bard for the skill set or access to rdd.  Or taking pal for the nice saves and imm to fear.  OR takin BG for charisma boost to saves.  I could go on..<br><br>I think the ONLY real build that would fit your suggestion is a monk using non-monk weapons, but guess what?  If you take 9 lvl you use monk for imp ev. If you take 6 you are exploitin the free IKD. If you take 3.. speed.  And 1 monk lvl..  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">     <br><br>In short, please just choose a build you like.  No use of a class is cheese if you have a reason.  Any use of a class (anyclass) is cheese if done for that sake (i have even seen cleric taken for "cheese" ).  It's just that monk is SOOO cheesy that we all take it as a given.  IMHO  cheese is inevitable when you have 3 classes.  THere is only one reason to add a third class (or there should be anyway) and thats to give the build something it doesnt have already.  OTherwise, why do it?   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/08/06 16:20:00 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I think avado answered your question like no other could... </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 07/16/06 01:12</span></i></p>
