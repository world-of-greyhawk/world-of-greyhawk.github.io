I'm not a fan of spellswords, I usually take Cleric instead, but if I were to pick one, I'm also biased and I'll pick my own: <br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "249788", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Magic Master (Monk 2 / Cleric 17 / Wizard 21)</a><br><br>A weird build with tons of spells yet acceptable buffed combat stats... and some more buffs.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

After messing with it, i remember a chat i had with the designer, and it turns out that it was a CONCEPT more than a play through build.

A dev-critter spellsword? nice.<br><br>By the way, yeah I forgot to mention what I like to see in a spellsword. And well, basically, I want to see buffs, offensive spells that can really be used (why the heck can't a Druid be considered a spellbow? I can Stonehold your mom while I hit you with my cool arrows; works for me) and melee stats above of what a Pure Fighter can get (acceptable damage, AB and AC to survive just on that). That way you can at least say "hey, I've got spellpower, and I still hit harder than a playable meleer, so taking this classes was worth something". <br><br>I like builds that excel at what they do, and since a spellsword won't excel at fighting or casting as much as a specialized build, playability and versatility are musts.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

I played something like Setanta1978's Spellblade with a scythe. I wasn't allowed Dev Crit though. It turned out pretty nice.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "271060", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Apologies for not really posting a build, but still...<br><br>I am not a fan of "spellswords" for the same reasons stated by Thax' and likewise usually make a cleric or druid if I want to melee/shoot and still have decent spellpower (gotta love Zen Archery) but I made a weird attempt at a PvP build in Badlands that may interest someone: Ranger 21/SD 2/Wizard 17 Maximum possible DEX with INT 19. First lvl of Wiz so I didn't have to spend attribute points in WIS, then all Ranger until he was epic. At that point I got him Bane of Enemies, then an SD level to make leveling somewhat easier, than all Wizard with a last SD lvl to skilldump Tumble and H/MS. He was an annoying Mord's/IGMS spammer with any buffs he could need. I fought Ithacan at Badlands Arena a couple times with him (tho I cannot believe myself honored enough for him to remember it).<br>_________________<br>Like Prometheus we are bound,<br>Chained to this rock of a brave new world,<br>Our godforsaken lot.
