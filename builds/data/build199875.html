<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>The Abuser:<br><br>Note: Developed using Character Build Calculator 1l. I havent tested him yet. I know it isnt the most uber thing, he is here because I think its concept is fairly cool.<br><br>I though on this char for a RP shard. I wanted to create some evil anti-paladin who could do really dirty fighting. I came up with this idea. This is a guy on full plate with a Two bladed sword who can use most asassin/rogue tricks (UMD, Tumble, sneak attack, poison), some summons (create undead/summon fiend) and could stand a fight like any plain old dual wielding fighter can.<br><br>His "dirty fighting" style would be knocking down his victim and frying him with crippling sneak attacks and strong blows.<br><br>Comments:<br>I did choose Human, but I think halfling and dwarf would be good too, That Epic Thoughness can be sacrificed because the human's bonus feat, and you have enough skill points to sacrifice the 43 you would lose for getting other race. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     <br><br>You can increase his str by 2 if you wish by trading Epic Toughness and Epic prowess for 2 Great str. Its exchanging 20HP for 1Dev.Crit DC and 1 more Main hand Damage. I found himself short on HP, so I took the toughness.<br><br>The skills are a bit messed, I take them 5 by 5 for making the sequence easier to read. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      Anyway, you can play with them as much as you wish. For example, you can hit 23 Taunt at level 20.

Why the two bladed sword? You might see a lot better results with a greatsword, plus gain a feat. I also don't think BG was the best choice wit a low CHA, but I can understand the RP reasons as well as anyone. You may also want to shift some rogue levels up a bit and take some fighter post epic. Thsi will let you get epic weapon specialization a bit earlier, as well as get more out of your build. A split of 10/10/20 would probably be a bit better. After all an 11th level of fighter doesn't really add anything. of course it's probably a wash on the level split, uless you start looking at something more drastic. Remember you only need a BAB of 16 to get four attacks pre 20.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

He gets more attacks at high ABs with the two-bladed sword than with the great sword, which means more hits per round on average.  And with 14d6 sneak, he'll get much more damage per round against sneak-attackable after an improved knockdown with the two bladed sword than with the greatsword.  In general, two handed weapons only dominate over dual wielding/two sided weapons when the STR bonus is by far the dominant amount of damage, such that 2 attacks from a 2 hander is almost as much damage as 2 main hand and 2 offhand attacks from the dual wielding would, and it would only take one missed swing from the dual wielder to do less damage.  With a build that has a chance for massive sneak damage, or one that gets more damage from buffing the weapon's damage, more attacks is generally better.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 06/16/05 20:58</span></i></p>

Heh, I'm starting to feel ashamed. Both the build and the RP concept seemed very good to me. I have tested it on the Novice to Epic and he does enough good on PvM.<br><br>I didnt test him for long, but, with a ceremonial blade +5 and other +5 equip boosting saves and some scrolls he could take down some liches, doom lords, a few drow mages and some driders with no problem at all -nor needing heal-, he also took a couple of dracolichs -these hurted a lot-.<br><br>He also managed to beat up a prismatic dragon but it was a real pain and I had to use high end equip (Save boosting, elemental resistances, piercing damage reduction and more specific equip from the OC...).<br><br>I liked the idea of the str based rogue when I saw the devastating rogue. He can deal same damage as a regular fighter, even Dev. Critical sometimes and score sneak attacks if he manages to knockdown his enemy. I maxed his number of attacks by dual wielding in order to raise both: Chance of dev.crit. and sneak attack damage per round.<br><br>I tried to max his AB and sneak attack without sacrificing one for the other, thats why I did get blackguard, he also has the useful bull's str for low magic worls and his summons can be useful at early levels, I think you gain more than you lose by getting it (20 fighter levels make a cool fighter, but I feel you dont need so many feats, taking blackguard would be halfway between fighter and rogue. Good BAB progression and sligh sneak attack).<br><br>I'm sorry if the build isn't good enough. It looked great to me.<br>_________________<br>Over Seven Years of High Quality RP. <a href="http://www.mytharria.org" target="_blank">www.mytharria.org</a> We offer a unique world with player based religions &amp; governments.

CoT can, in fact, get epic weapon specialization.  However, you have to get weapon specialization first with a fighter.  CoT can not get the regular weapon specialization feat. Which, of course, your build uses fighter to get the regular weapon specialization, so you should be good <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DarkStar27909 on 06/17/05 15:38</span></i></p>

Ya CoT levels will do a lot more level for level than BG. I liked both versions with the exceptions I pointed out above, but the CoT will be much better on alow CHA build than the BG.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Hehe, I forgot to give another reason to not to choose CoT (apart of the RP reason). Mytharria, the RP server where I play doesnt have prestige classes yet (You need a trainer on your class to level up on it, and they havent put them yet). But, from what I saw at the forums, it doesnt look like they will be adding CoT, PM nor RDD, thats why I didnt get CoT at first.<br><br>Thanks for the feedback. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Over Seven Years of High Quality RP. <a href="http://www.mytharria.org" target="_blank">www.mytharria.org</a> We offer a unique world with player based religions &amp; governments.
