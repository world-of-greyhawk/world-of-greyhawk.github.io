So I'm going to be using the Fighter 11/ WM 28/ Bard 1 build and I was wondering what the best level progression and feats would be to take with that. I thought the progression would go something like 1-10 Fighter, 11-23 WM, 24 Fighter, 25-39 WM, 40 Bard. Epic feats would be Great Strengths (not sure how many) and all the dev crit requirements, then normal feats like KD and all those required for WM<br>_________________<br>"He was happily married.. but his wife wasn't"-Victor Borge<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Honer Nerd on 10/21/08 01:07</span></i></p>

Why Fighter 11 and not Bard 2? For another skill dump?

Are you playing this character from the ground up or is it being born at level 40?<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I'd take the Bard skilldump at level 37, not 40.<br><br>You seem to have your build pretty well rounded up, so I'm not sure what you're asking for here. If you could post the full build layout we could point out errors (if any) or improvements, but i don't see any wrong with your current build idea: a dev-critting Weapon Master, you can't go wrong with that.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/28/06 23:16:09 (GMT) -- Big Meph<br>Using the 2 ESF's in a dex based sneak build, <i>to me</i>, just looks like you're teasing your diabetic opponent with extra sugar on your whipcream covered chocolate mudcake.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 10/21/08 13:06</span></i></p>

Level 40 could be a good option if he's investing in Spellcraft (and has 14 INT. The extra +1 to saves vs spells could be worth waiting for) or Taunt (the higher the better).<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Hah, I've got to apologize, I'm a terrible builder and even with things spelled out for me, I can find a way to muck it up. Think Dennis the Menace with NWN and a computer.<br><br>And the character will be born at lvl 40 on a mid-high magic server. I may end up taking the skill dump at 37 since I'm probably going to put the points into tumble. Of course, if there are more skill points, I may just be robbing myself of a few helping hands when it comes to rolls in RP or what have you.<br>_________________<br>"He was happily married.. but his wife wasn't"-Victor Borge
