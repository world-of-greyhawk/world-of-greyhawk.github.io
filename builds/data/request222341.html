Hey, everyone, Aco here. I've been looking around for the past two days or so, but I can't really find anything that suits my needs.<br><br>I'm looking for a Weapon Master (specialized preferably in Greataxe, Scythe, Halberd, or Greatsword...anything large) that uses Disarm to it's fullest. I know that basically means take Imp Disarm and get a Large weapon, but interestingly enough there really aren't any builds with this concept around here, or at least not that I can find. <br><br>I'd need the build to have Rogue, Assassin, Monk, or Bard, so that I can get either UMD or access to Monk-Only items, since that's the only way you can get +5 AC boots on my server. I'd also like for it to have IKD and Improved Expertise. Overwhelming Critical is yet another thing that I'd need, but not Devestating, as I don't like that.<br><br>Now, the logical course would be a Fighter/WM/Monk, since you get the necessary feats for both WM and the ID and IE that I'm looking for, as well as IKD for free, a nice critical range with great critical damage. That's what I've been looking for, but none of them I can pull off enough pre-epic feats for the things I need...they typically focus on taking WM as soon as possible and using the Fighter feats in Epic to get things like Epic Focus and Devestating Critical.<br><br>If anyone can point me in the direction of a build that might be able to get all these things, I'd be extremely grateful.<br><br>~Aco

Try this one. I just whipped it up quickly, but I think it works.

Thanks a lot, Cinnabar! It doesn't have overwhelming, but I think I might be able to modify the epic levels a bit to get it, not sure...I know it's really really tight on feats.<br><br>Regardless, thank you very much. The pre-epic levels are perfect. =)<br><br>&lt;Edit&gt;<br><br>Oops! It does have overwhelming, just didn't see it. In that case, the build's perfect, then! Thanks a lot, I'll be sure to put this to good use.<br><br>~Aco<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Acothea on 12/03/05 03:43</span></i></p>

I know it's a bit late, but I have had great sucess with a druid14/CoT25/monk1. The divine wrath on a dragonshape build gives you an unarmed disarm (item goes to your inventory) that is size large for 8 attacks per round if built right for a tremendous, albeit temporary AB.

If you dont need the extra 5 ac, you can take imp-crit pre epic instead of imp-expertise, and fit another epic feat in on the 21 level. Maybe another epic toughness.<br><br>Depends where you play though, you might need that extra AC instead of HPs.
