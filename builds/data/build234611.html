You're a DEX based melee using two weapons, not very high damage dealing but lots of attacks, you see a wizard and think: "easy kill", he uses Epic Warding, you think: "I'll kill him when it wares off" so you heal as much as you can while it's still on, it wares off, and you attack... and you read 0 damage, you think: "What the heck?", his protection is over already, did he bugged the game or what? no, he's a Dwarven Defender caster.<br><br>Alright, I made no story for it.... I might do it the next time.......<br><br>This is caster that can withstand much more than regular melee characters, and should be painful for DEX based melee with Weapon Prowess, who don't deal much but have high ACs, but AC won't cover you from spells (although Improved Evasion with high DEX might work, grrrr), it is ready with a decent damage reduction of 21 and a supreme HP of 624. Spells are regular, characters with high spell resistance would be the end of him, still, he's not really weak.<br><br>Playable Levels: 1-40<br><br>Basically a good caster on pre-epic, might get somewhat tough on epic levels as spells don't get stronger and Damage Reduction comes until high levels.<br><br>PvM, untested PvP<br><br>Race: Dwarf<br><br>Alignment: Any lawful<br><br>Stats:<br>STR 9<br>DEX 14<br>CON 19 (26)<br>WIS 8<br>INT 16 (20)<br>CHA 6<br><br>1 Wizard - Toughness<br>2 Wizard<br>3 Wizard - Still Spell<br>4 Wizard - INT +1 (17)<br>5 Wizard - Spell Penetration<br>6 Wizard - Greater Spell Penetration<br>7 Wizard<br>8 Wizard - INT +1 (18)<br>9 Wizard - Empower Spell<br>10 Wizard - Maximize Spell<br>11 Wizard<br>12 Wizard - INT +1 (19), Dodge<br>13 Wizard<br>14 Wizard<br>15 Wizard - Expertise, Combat Casting<br>16 Wizard - CON +1 (20)<br>17 Wizard<br>18 Dwarven Defender - Improved Expertise<br>19 Dwarven Defender<br>20 Dwarven Defender - CON +1 (21)<br>21 Wizard - Epic Spell Penetration<br>22 Dwarven Defender<br>23 Dwarven Defender<br>24 Wizard - INT +1 (20), Automatic Still Spell I<br>25 Dwarven Defender<br>26 Dwarven Defender<br>27 Wizard - Automatic Still Spell II, Automatic Still Spell III<br>28 Dwarven Defender - CON +1 (22)<br>29 Dwarven Defender<br>30 Dwarven Defender - Epic Damage Reduction I<br>31 Dwarven Defender<br>32 Dwarven Defender - CON +1 (23)<br>33 Wizard - Epic Spell: Epic Warding<br>34 Dwarven Defender<br>35 Dwarven Defender - Epic Damage Reduction II<br>36 Dwarven Defender - CON +1 (24), Great Constitution I (25)<br>37 Dwarven Defender<br>38 Dwarven Defender<br>39 Wizard - Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor<br>40 Dwarven Defender - CON +1 (26), Epic Damage Reduction III<br><br>I though Epic Spells might be useful, but those are the main thing that can be changed, if something is better.<br><br>Skills:<br>Discipline 43<br>Concentration 43<br>Heal 43<br>Spellcraft 42<br>Tumble 20<br>54 remaining points, but there are not many class skills, so I don't know what else to give him.<br><br>Saving Throws:<br>Fortitude 26<br>Reflex 18<br>Will 22<br><br>HP: 624<br><br>Naked AC: 16 (But he's ready to use full plate and shield)<br><br>BAB 21<br>Naked AB: +20/+15/+10<br><br>Not real use of AB since he fights with spells.<br><br>4 slots of level 9 spells........<br><br>Advantages: Damage Reduction 21, High HP.<br><br>AC is not that bad, he uses full plate and shield..... not really high either.<br><br>Disadvantages: Weak casting and practically no melee, low saves.<br><br>Feedback...

Nice DR (21/-) &amp; very nice HPs for a caster, however with intelligence 20 means low DCs on your spells...plus without critical immunity will still be taking damage vs. crits, especially vs. high threat ranges with low AC...<br><br>can you cast spells whilst in Defensive Stance???!

You can't cast spells in Defensive Stance without deactivating it's effects.

With cheesy I meant stuff like Ike's Yikes &amp; Bigby's, but yeah, use Meteor Swarm <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Spell DC = 10 + spell level + casting ability modifier (eg. CHA for a Sorcerer) + other stuff, namely SpF feats or special conditions (Implosion has an additional +3 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> )<br><br>As for EMA: if you already have +5 items, it's hardly useful. If your world has +3 items, and you have an extra feat, it's worth considering. The lower the magic, the better the spell. IMO, EW is always the better one, all other epic spells are extra.<br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm

You're right Cinnabar Din.... DEX still works as for Evasion as well as for Improved Evasion, sorry for the misunderstanding, if any, it would be the same both while counting DEX, but you get the point.<br><br>About the changes, if I get PM levels my level 9 spells come until Wizard 12 / PM 10, making me lose DD levels for automatic still spell and Epic Warding, which must be taken leveling as a caster, ending Wizard 15 / Pale Master 10 / Dwarven Defender 15 or similar, reducing DR to 18/- and while it's not bad, the concept is the DR, and I'll pray not to find high critical enemies.<br><br>I'll still make one change though , since I would suppose the DC is low no matter what, better change the Intelligence to 19 and take CON +1 at level 24, then changing Epic Mage Armor to Great CON to end with 28 CON and 19 INT for a +40 HP.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;You can't cast spells in Defensive Stance without deactivating it's effects.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Seems you're right Ythaniel, Defensive Stance doesn't cancells, but its effects do.
