I read a previous posts that talked about getting Auto Still Spell as a bonus PM feat if you met the requirements, but I cannot seem to. <br><br>I'm sure I'm missing something so if anyone can point it out I would greatly appreciate it. <br><br>Ok, the build I was working on was Bard/RDD/PM. At level 32 I was B10/RDD10/PM12, and I had already taken Still Spell and my spellcraft was 27. (I believe those are the requirements for Auto Still Spell) I have read many times you can ignore the lv9 spell level requirements....unless that got changed in the last patch?<br><br>On lv33 (PM13) I got my bonus feat along with your normal feat, but my bonus list was only Epic Energy Resistance. At level 39 (PM16), I also got the normal bonus PM feat, but my only choices were Epic Spells and Epic Energy Resist. <br><br>What am I missing?

I do believe you're missing level 9 spells, a prereq. of Auto Still feats.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

Try taking PM to over lvl15; seems other lvl9 requirements are ignored then (eg epic spells for a lvl5 bard)

Unfortunately, Autostill spell is not one of those feats that PM 15 goes over.  You must be able to cast lvl 9 arcane spells, period.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

Yes, this seems to be the answer.<br><br>A bard/PM can never get Auto Still Spells due to the lack of lv9 spells.  <br><br>Tks all.
