"CLERIC! CLERIC! CLERIC!"<br><br>Schmelv reeled backwards from the verbal assault being perpertrated through his front door. Schmelv's hand instictively arced towards the underarm ultra-quick-release scabbard (patent pending) where his handaxe nestled.<br><br>"STRONG ONES, WISE ONES, BIG ONES, SMALL ONES. BECOME A CLEEEEEERIIIIIIC Noowwww.....!!!"<br><br>Schmelv at this point was processing two simultaneous thoughts, 1) Man, diret marketing is getting REAL direct nowdays. 2) This insane idiot is gonna die. DIE! DIE!!! (three exclamation marks pointing out to the mentally astute that this point was very important to Schmelv and propbably deserved to be number one in this list)<br><br>"REPENT!"<br><br>Standing in his doorway was a Cleric of Odava. A real nauseatingly persistent bunch of loonies that would stop at nothing to spread their very own ideas of exactly how everyone should live their lives, and be dammed to rot in eternal damnation (or watching Nicolas Cage movie re-runs) if you didnt. The very idea of which they simply didnt seem to have the will, or mental faculty to process.<br><br>Now, this particular cleric disciple reeled backwards as the back of Schmelv's very sharp, very pointy axe made a bee-line towards his left eyeball. This was not entirely an unexpected outcome to the first round of delivering this particular sales pitch. It was just that in this case, the sales target (Schmelv) happened to be an ultra experienced elite veteran wood-elf Wild Rider. The very fact that the disciple was still alive was only testament to Schmelv being drunk off his rocker on dwarf mead, a particularly nasty little boutique brew originating from a little micro-brewery names Grizz Rot-Gut or Gut-Rot-Grizz or somesuch, Schmelv couldnt remember, but you get the drift. The Wild Rider's reflexes were legendary, their general ability to skewer and carve their enemies into shapes that were not very much like the blueprint design that their hereditary DNA (or creator, take your pick) intended were stuff of fable. Death at the pointy end of a Wild Rider's weapon was ultimately very fast and disruptive to ambitions of happily-ever-after. Goes without saying really doesnt it.<br><br>But Schmelv stopped. The pointy end of the handaxe was a mere fraction of a millimeter from the hapless Cleric's aforementioned left eyeball, the Cleric was delicately balanced on the balls of his feet, his back making such a perfect arch that any yogii would have been very proud. The Cleric stood very still. Schmelv also stood motionless. Well, his handaxe did .. the rest of his body wavered a bit in his drunken state, and in the stillness of the moment he let out a little beer-n-beans fart. The Cleric didnt quite see the mirth in the situation, but the thought did trigger the hey-thats-kinda-hilarious part of Schmelv's psyche.<br><br>'Wots goin on 'ere den eh?" Schmelv's drinking buddy Eddy staggered up behind the pair at the front door. Staggered is probably giving Eddy too much credit for the gyrations that brought him to the front of the house. But to the front he did get, and was now surveying the scene, not quite comprehending, yet his evil twisted mind sensing that this could be an interesting development in an afternoon that was going to hell in a drunken handbasket anyway.<br><br>At this point, dear reader, we take the literary liberty of casting the story backwards somewhat. You may well be wondering how Schmelv has found himself on the wrong end of 40 (in pure mechanical terms, but his elf-age was upwards of 320) and deep in the throes of alcoholic suspension. His career was always on the fast track. Schmelv found his stardom through an initial hard slog however, eking out a living in the wood-elf frontline archer regiments. His archery was commendable by wood elf standards, if not entirely up to scratch for where he started out. This of course translates into an archery skill considered stupendously excellent by most other standards. However, it didnt take long for an astute noble one day, in seeing another side of Schmelv during some regimental excercises. Schmelv's propensity for violence was second to none, a real A-grade nut job when the bell of battle tolled. His riding skill was also right up there, so naturally he was shepherded into the shock troop of the wood-elf corps. The Wild Riders of Kournos.<br><br>These boys and gals liked nothing better than charging down their enemy, fully standing astride their mount, hair flying in the wind and tattooed bodies on (nearly) full display; immense compound bows whistling in the wind delivering a proverbial hail of death and mayhem, and then whipping out assorted paraphernalia (daggers, handaxes, maces etc) for the close-up destruction of whatever happens to still be standing. Kinda think along the lines of a bunch of american indians screaming down at you at full tilt, and I dont care even if youre name is M.R.Morrison, and you have fixed all the wagons for all the little ladies in the world .. you're toast. Just ask G.A.Custer what its like.<br><br>Schmelv made it to the very highest of echelons in the Wild Rider corps, his tattoos marking the highest of high distinctions and commendations. His fans adored him, his peers respected him, his enemies generally didnt think much cos they were mostly dead. We all of course know that mostly dead isnt necessarily all dead, and with the right potions and bellows you can bring people back from the ultimate brink etc etc etc (if you get the pop-culture reference then we have said enough and you know what i mean, otherwse its tough-bikkies and we get back to the program). I digress.<br><br>However, Schmelv let his fame get to him, and started indulging in all sorts of goody-goody treats, amongst which was deep-fried peanut butter banana toastees. Yuech. No wonder he spent more and more of his time in the service on the latrines. Thusly resulting in a decay in his moral fortitude and physical prowess that ultimately saw him fall from grace, and end buddied-up with the miscreant colloquially known as 'Unsteady Eddy' (which some readers may already be aquainted with from prior frays into the depths my somewhat disturbed mind), working odd-jobs for one real mean s.o.b that goes by the name 'Wallace'.<br><br>"Eddy." Schmelv barked out, and Eddy stopped on the spot. Eddy was looking much worse for wear than he usually did. He was just about partied-out. "Eddy, dont puke on my floor. This damn floor has just been sanded, resurfaced, and laminated in the most ridiculously expensive imported crap you ever heard, and I aint gonna have you messin it up. The Cleaner (tm) took great pains to make sure that stunt you pulled last week washed off this damn floor, and dont make me have to re-pontificate about the finer points of the path of the righteous man being beset on all sides by any and all inequities, and having to be shepherded through some stoopid valley of darkness cos I AM the shadow of death, I AM the inequity, and I aint gonna be shepherding your or anyones hiney for much longer, in fact there will be great vengeance and furious anger vented on ANYONE that even thinks about just scratching this BRAND. NEW. FLOOR".<br><br>A drip of sweat dribbled its way down the Cleric of Odava's forehead, and out onto the point of his nose. This was'nt looking good. Not good at all.<br><br>"If youre gonna hurl, hurl into this"<br><br>With his free hand Schmelv reached inside the top pocket of his vest and retreived a crumpled up paper cup.<br><br>Eddy looked at the cup.<br><br>"HUH?"<br><br>"Eddy, take the cup."<br><br>The Cleric of Odaman now knew he was in real deep trouble. These guys were first-grade nutters. He had met real-deal Hillbillies that were more predictable and less likely to pig-spit him.<br><br>"And Eddy, bring out the Gimp"<br><br>"But Schmelv, the Gimp's asleep"<br><br>Yep. Reeeal trouble.<br><br>-----------------<br><br>Wild Rider of Kournos<br><br>Not spectacular, but playable. Probably best for Low magic, but viable for mid magic pw's, PVE only.<br><br>Concept: This is a themed Asrai (Wood Elf) build. It is a DEX mounted archer .. a wild rider that can pack a punch from afar then close in for the finessed melee kill. Can call upon the forest spirits for combat and ability boosts (approximated via wiz spells, barb rage)<br><br>There are some ok synergies going on with this build..<br><br>Barbarian<br>- Uncanny Dodge to retain Dex bonus when flatfooted<br>- Rage for extra str melee (and ranged mighty) damage.. too much str is often wasted on non dev crit archers due to mighty limitations on weapons<br>- 10% movement to help with sniping, repositioning etc - always handy with an archer<br>-  terrifying rage<br><br>Wiz<br>- Can buff Dex, Con, Str, AC<br>- use arcane scrolls<br><br><br>AA<br>- Helps qualify for 19 pre-epic BAB that counts towards melee AB<br><br>Feats selections explained:<br>- Ride skill, with Mounted Combat feat: +6 AC .. +8AC if Dex modifier taken is into account by the NW engine (not sure on this one). This gives the toon an acceptable AC given there is no primary tumble dump class. These 2 feats are integral to the concept of build<br>- Terrifying Rage .. -2 AB to all, with little chance of resistance (vs DC51+1d10)<br>- Weapon finesse .. (use mace to deal bludgeon dmg when required), gives sword&amp;board option (no tower shield though)<br><br>Skills<br>- taunt taken for boss fights where a bit of boost is required<br>- low 40's discipline is almost as good as no discipline, but with some str buff spells and rage it goes up a bit<br><br>Additional Notes:<br>- Handaxe in this version is style only, replace with mace would be smarter, or drop the 2 wf feats and get blindfight and probably impr crit longbow<br>- For a more straight-up shooter, drop 4Wiz for 4AA to get around 57ab ranged <br><br>Barbarian(16), Illusionist(5), Arcane Archer(19), Elf<br><br>STR: 12<br>DEX: 18 (32)<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Elf: (Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Keen Sense, Low-light Vision, Skill Affinity: Listen, Skill Affinity: Search, Skill Affinity: Spot, Sleeplessness)<br>01: Barbarian(1): Point Blank Shot<br>02: Illusionist(1): {Scribe Scroll}<br>03: Barbarian(2): Weapon Focus: Longbow, {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>04: Barbarian(3): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br>05: Barbarian(4)<br>06: Barbarian(5): Weapon Finesse<br>07: Barbarian(6)<br>08: Arcane Archer(1): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>09: Arcane Archer(2): Mounted Combat<br>10: Arcane Archer(3)<br>11: Arcane Archer(4)<br>12: Arcane Archer(5): DEX+1, Mounted Archery, (DEX=21)<br>13: Arcane Archer(6)<br>14: Arcane Archer(7)<br>15: Arcane Archer(8): Called Shot<br>16: Arcane Archer(9): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>17: Arcane Archer(10)<br>18: Barbarian(7): Weapon Focus: Handaxe<br>19: Barbarian(8)<br>20: Barbarian(9): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br>21: Illusionist(2): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=24)<br>22: Barbarian(10)<br>23: Barbarian(11)<br>24: Barbarian(12): DEX+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Handaxe, (DEX=25)<br>25: Barbarian(13)<br>26: Barbarian(14)<br>27: Barbarian(15): Terrifying Rage<br>28: Illusionist(3): DEX+1, (DEX=26)<br>29: Illusionist(4)<br>30: Arcane Archer(11): Armor Skin<br>31: Arcane Archer(12)<br>32: Arcane Archer(13): DEX+1, (DEX=27)<br>33: Arcane Archer(14): Great Dexterity II, Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow, (DEX=28)<br>34: Arcane Archer(15)<br>35: Arcane Archer(16)<br>36: Arcane Archer(17): DEX+1, Great Dexterity III, (DEX=30)<br>37: Arcane Archer(18): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=31)<br>38: Arcane Archer(19)<br>39: Barbarian(16): Epic Skill Focus: Intimidate<br>40: Illusionist(5): DEX+1, Empower Spell, (DEX=32)<br><br>Hitpoints: 444<br>Skillpoints: 248<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 25/17/31<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +4<br>BAB: 29<br>AB (max, naked): 43 (melee), 53 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 23/26<br>Spell Casting: Wizard(3)<br>Alignment Changes: 0<br><br>Discipline 42(43), Intimidate 42(51), Listen 37(38), Spellcraft 42(44), Taunt 42(41), Ride 42(53)<br><br>Critique away.<br>_________________<br>Workings of a Chaotic-Neutral mind:<br><br>Mind to Subconscious: Sir!

Why do you say no tower shield?<br><br>IMOs...<br><br>Dual-wielding is a waste.  BF and imp crit are clearly preferable.<br><br>Discipline w/ the DEX version is a waste.<br><br>A STR based archer w/out Dev Crit?  Smells fishy.<br><br><br>Overall, I agree.  It's more than playable, but not fantastic.  I think you achieve your goals though.  I'll give points for making a Terrifying Rage archer.  Not sure it makes the most sense, but, heck, there's a bit of coolness to be had.

k, i applaud the 3 builds, though not sure why you didnt decide on a "best" one.  While you did put BAB 29 (which they all are), you DIDNT put the ab in each build.  <br><br>The strength build, while having the same BAB as the dexer, DOESNT have any stat modifier towards AB vs the dexer version.  It would be helpful to have added the AB line with a mundane bow in order to truly compare the builds.  I have always found it best, when putting up a build, to not leave much up to the imagination of the reader.  AB calcs ARE complex if you arent certain.  <br><br>That said, i dont understand going high str with a dex weapon with no dev crit.  Maybe you could explain it to make us understand?  As it stands, it reminds me of a guy one time who did an ICONIC shadow dancer, but couldnt decide on ONE, so he posted 4 ICONIC shadowdancer builds...

Re: discipline .. i probably should have added that esf:intimidate can easily be swapped out for esf:discipline<br><br>To be honest, terrifying rage is a gimmick at best, and the discipline boost in the 'real world' is a much better proposition. Especially if you can get +12 str, and even a modest disc boost item. This gets you to around the 60 mark, which based on my (mostly medium magic pw) experiece is a number i'm comfy with.<br>_________________<br>Workings of a Chaotic-Neutral mind:<br><br>Mind to Subconscious: Sir!

Where I usually play there are no KD immunites and it is possible to get enough discipline on a dexterity based character to be reasonably difficult to KD or disarm.  Of course you can get more on a str based character, but that is silly to say that if you can't have as much as a str based character, that you don't want any at all.  Just because you won't resist everything doesn't mean that you should just give up and not be able to resist anything.  I am biased because of where I play, so maybe the issue is more server-specific than I would think.<br><br>*edit*<br>on a side note, I suppose most things are server and module specific.

A couple more words, and then I'll be done, as this isn't really the place for a discussion of the usefulness of discipline, or the lack thereof.<br><br>First, yes, this can be hugely server specific.  In general, I prefer to speak of these things with two considerations.  One is imagining a world where there are no items, or alterations.  Two is to imagine a common, well-balanced world.  Yes, those are woefully imprecise.  If something works where you play, then more power to ya, but I try to think of these things in the abstract, as well as what in my experience is the most likely situation.<br><br>Towards that end, if you're playing in a world where KD is used often by the enemies, there is likely KD immunity, and you likely need it, unless you can have an excellent discipline.  In my experience, this is the most common situation, and I find that sad.<br><br>In such a world, one really needs a reasonable assurance that one is going to not be knocked on one's butt the majority of the time.  If your discipline is such that you will fail, say, 50% of the time, then it is not reliable, and hence, useless.  Either non STR builds will suffer greatly, or there is KD immunity.  A sub-par discipline is then only useful when dealing with grossly inferior enemies.<br><br>Yes, I am speaking only of KD.  Called Shot and Disarm are both far less common, and easier to deal with when they do occur.  KD, on the other hand, can lead to a quick demise.  Either your discipline is sufficient to handle the KD attempts, or it isn't, and you need to look elsewhere.<br><br>Again, of course, results may vary.  Generally speaking though, I think it's a good rule that discipline on a DEX build is a waste.

I have even seen some that dictate the alignment!  <br><br>All that aside, the ECB IS and always has been (at least since 2005) a place where mundane is the key.  I dare not say all the builds, as a few may have slipped by the group, but the rules of the guild have been to post with MUNDANE armor and weapons PRIMARILY.  What this means is, the builds are supposed to stand as they are with NO ITEM MODIFICATIONS allowed in the postings.  In other words, i may have built a character to use the most powerful weapon on a pw, but if i were posting it here, the build would NOT include that items mods in calculations.  The build MUST stand NEKKID! (with mundane gear only).  <br><br>What this allows for, we hope, is for the player to look at a build and being familiar with what is available on the mod/pw, could assertain for themselves how the build would be like.  Of course, foci (wpn and spell) are ALWAYS up to the player to choose, the build being a guide.  <br><br>There have been very few builds that i havent monkeyed with when playing on a pw to fit my personal needs.  The adapting of level splits to meet requirements isnt a big deal USUALLY.  What i am saying is, NONE of the builds in ECB should be looked at as FINAL!  There is always somethingt to tinker with to make it your own.<br><br>SO, to sum up: NO, none of the builds on ECB are server specific as they "all" should be done with mundane gear, no items.

These builds stand alone, but discussion need not.  We should always remember that the purpose of these builds is to be played, and that no build exists in a vacuum.  Yes, always assume no gear, and represent the build itself without any environmental specifics, but that is more of an agreed upon formality, for clarity's sake.  Don't forget that a build which rocks may not rock all the more when decked out with gear.  Never will all things be equal.
