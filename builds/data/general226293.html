I am currently attempting a Druid 5/ Shifter 13/ Rogue 22 build. He has taken ISA 2, Improved Knockdown, Construct Shape, and Dragon Shape. I thought the idea was somewhat revolutionary, though somebody probably did it already. So far as I can tell, its an okay build, though it only gets 3 attacks per round. <br>I basically just need general help. You know, what stats carry over into a transformation, what could be done to get an extra attack without hurting the build too much, that sort of thing. <br>He is a dwarf with <br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 10<br>Con 14<br>Int 14<br>Wis 30<br>Cha 6<br><br>I don't really know that much about the kind of build, so any help whatsoever would be appreciated.

What do you want to do with the build?  If you are gonna use Humanoid shape (aka kobald) then you should take 17 shifter lvls to get Epic unlimited humanoid shape.  What shapes did you have in mind, etc?<br><br>It is a very interesting idea you have started!

He will mostly be using construct form and dragon form. Constructs are not as powerful but they have the nice ability to fit through small doorways. 	:) <br>Thirteen levels in shifter allow him to have 30 wisdom (prereq for dragon form) at level 40 and claim his level 13 bonus feat at that level. <br>Epic huminoid shape you say? Now you see, that is the kind of information I would love to have. What benefits do epic vs. non epic have? Is there a way to improve his construct form?<br>Again, virtually any knowledge about this kind of thing is what I want. I basically want to sponge up huge amounts of information about this kind of thing from anyone that knows something about it. <br><br>Thanks
