Wouldn't decreasing starting str to 14 allow you to have 6 more points to add to other stats, like con?

Yes, and since you're putting level-up ability increases into Con and Cha anyway, you might as well lower the starting strength to 14. That way you could increase the amount of Con you start with to 16, and Cha to 14, so they finish at 18 and 16 respectively. You'd finish up with 32 Str to boot. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Herbie Shimmer on 01/24/05 18:00</span></i></p>

Also to what was mentioned, the epic fiend withonly 16 BC levels is a wasted feat. It won't be very potent vs. a serious encounter.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>
