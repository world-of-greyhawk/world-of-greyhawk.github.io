<b>Straight level 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>I posted this build on the Looking for Excellent Character Builds thread, version 10, so some time ago now. It's not in the index on this guild so I thought I should include it, it's one of my favourite ever builds, because it crams so much into its 40 levels. It isn't as good since they released 1.64 and fixed Divine Power, but it's still more than effective at what it does.<br><br>-----------<br><br>I'm practically sure this next build has been done to death, but it's so powerfully sweet I thought I'd post it again. There's nothing new or original here, it's just a mishmash of a few other builds. But it's so damn good you can't ignore it. It's easily the best melee build I've made, the only thing he's lacking is decent AC, but usually everything dies so quickly it doesn't matter.<br><br>Herbie's Take on the Battle Cleric: the Divine Kukri!<br>(finishes 17 Cleric / 16 Fighter / 7 WM)<br>Human, True Neutral<br>Str 15<br>Dex 15<br>Con 10<br>Int 14<br>Wis 14<br>Cha 8<br>Increase Str every 4 levels, except for level 28 and level 32, when you increase Wis instead<br><br>Feats and Progression<br>1 - Fighter 1 - Dodge, Mobility, Exotic Weapon Proficiency<br>2 - Fighter 2 - Weapon Focus Kukri<br>3 - Fighter 3 - Expertise<br>4 - Fighter 4 - Spring Attack, Strength +1 (Str-&gt;16)<br>5 - Cleric 1 / Fighter 4 - Trickery domain, Travel or Earth domain<br>6 - Cleric 2 / Fighter 4 - Whirlwind Attack<br>8 - Cleric 4 / Fighter 4 - Strength +1 (Str-&gt;17)<br>9 - WM 1 / Cleric 4 / Fighter 4 - Power Attack<br>12 - WM 4 / Cleric 4 / Fighter 4 - Cleave, Strength +1 (Str-&gt;18)<br>14 - Fighter 6 / WM 4 / Cleric 4 - Improved Critical Kukri<br>15 - Fighter 7 / WM 4 / Cleric 4 - Great Cleave<br>16 - Fighter 8 / WM 4 / Cleric 4 - Ambidexterity, Strength +1 (Str-&gt;19)<br>18 - Fighter 10 / WM 4 / Cleric 4 - Two Weapon Fighting, ITWF<br>20 - Fighter 12 / WM 4 / Cleric 4 - Weapon Specialization Kukri, Strength +1 (Str-&gt;20)<br>21 - WM 5 / Fighter 12 / Cleric 4 - Epic Weapon Focus Kukri<br>24 - Cleric 5 / Fighter 12 / WM 7 - Great Strength 1, Strength +1 (Str-&gt;22)<br>27 - Cleric 8 / Fighter 12 / WM 7 - Great Strength 2 (Str-&gt;23)<br>28 - Cleric 9 / Fighter 12 / WM 7 - Wisdom +1 (Wis-&gt;15)<br>30 - Cleric 11 / Fighter 12 / WM 7 - Great Wisdom 1 (Wis-&gt;16)<br>32 - Cleric 13 / Fighter 12 / WM 7 - Wisdom +1 (Wis-&gt;17)<br>33 - Cleric 14 / Fighter 12 / WM 7 - Great Wisdom 2 (Wis-&gt;18)<br>36 - Fighter 13 / Cleric 16 / WM 7 - Overwhelming Critical Kukri, Strength +1 (Str-&gt;24)<br>37 - Fighter 14 / Cleric 16 / WM 7 - Epic Weapon Specialization Kukri<br>39 - Cleric 17 / Fighter 15 / WM 7 - Great Wisdom 3 (Wis-&gt;19)<br>40 - Fighter 16 / Cleric 17 / WM 7 - Devastating Critical Kukri, Strength +1 (Str-&gt;25)<br><br>I'm going to explain my thought process when I realised how super powerful this build could actually be. It went something like this:<br><br>1. Out of all the Bioware endorsed epic builds, the Kukri Master impresses me the most, because it's so focused and efficient at one thing: killing lots of enemies as quickly as possible.<br>2. Through making my own characters as effective as I could, I've learned that Cleric is the best class to support melee abilities, because they get even better attacking prowess from the buffing spells and some much-needed defensive abilities too.<br>3. 11 levels of Cleric is the absolute minumum; but the more the merrier, as long you can afford the stat points being thrown into Wisdom. This led me to think of 4.<br>4. Give the Kukri Master as many cleric levels as he can take, and hope for the best.<br><br>So this build is what I came up with. The Divine Kukri's power lies in his ability to strike unbelievably often, threatening a crit on a roll of 13 (10 with keen kukris), 8 or 9 times per round. Even if the enemies are immune to crits or have high Fortitude saves, DK has so many different damage types on his weapons, not to mention a x3 crit multiplier, that when he's going PvM he can often rack up kills before he even rolls a 13 or higher. But let's not forget that he can also cast Harm, Heal, Mass Heal, Greater Sanctuary, Word of Faith, Implosion, Storm of Vengeance, Blade Barrier etc. His flexibility makes him even more powerful.<br><br>His AB isn't that great for a Fighter / WM, due to only 25 Str, only 7 WM levels, and no Epic Prowess. The cleric buffs more than make up for it, though. He gets the full +5 bonuses from Greater Magic Weapon (remember to cast it on both kukris) and Divine Favour. He's vulnerable to being dispelled, though. If you're fighting a high AC creature, and he's been dispelled, it's probably a good idea to cast Greater Sanctuary, run away and re-buff. Or cast Word of Faith, Harm, then Searing Light or something. That usually does the trick.<br><br>As I've said, this is only my personal take on a build that's probably not original. Although, I can't recall having seen a melee cleric dual wielding kukris, and this write up and level progression is entirely my own work. If anyone can spot any ways to make this guy even better please, please post them here. He is too powerful to not get optimised.<br><br>-----------<br><br>There's a few things that I should add to this write up. Skills-wise, he has enough points to get 40 Spellcraft, max Discipline and Concentration, 4 Intimidate and cross class Tumble. I can't remember how all the Cleric buffs add to AB and AC, but he seems to wind up with about 55AB when fully buffed, using no magical equipment.<br><br>The build was supreme before patch 1.64 came out. Divine Power gave him an extra 2 attacks per round (if you cast it twice) and Haste gave an extra one (still does, actually) so the Divine Kukri had 9 attacks per round when fully buffed. If he got his hands on keen kukris, he threatened a critical hit on rolls of 10-20. That's 55% of the time. He could mince his way through anything not immune to crits. With all the cleric buffs adding magical damage and EWS adding +6 damage to all hits, even if things were immune to crits, he still got went through them quickly. <br><br>Unfortunately patch 1.64 means he loses those 2 extra attacks per round, but come on, 7 attacks threatening a Dev Crit on 10-20, protected by cleric buffs including Improved Invisibility - that's still more than respectable. He can cast up to 9th level cleric spells too, which includes things like Word of Faith, Harm, mass Heal, Storm of Vengeance etc. The DC isn't great but PvM they still have their uses.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 07/07/05 23:45</span></i></p>
