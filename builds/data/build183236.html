The awesome power that Dragons possess has lead to them being crowned the King of all animals, some dragons have even been worshiped as gods in their own right. However what good is a mortal god, for even the greatest of dragons will eventually die? Sammaster, a powerful wizard favoured by the gods who possessed great power (similar to Elminster and Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun), recognised the problem of death but rather than try to prevent it among dragons he embraced it. For once a dragon died he would resurrect it as an immortal Dracolich. Even the greatest of dragons would fall before these mighty beasts.<br><br>Sammaster then created the Cult of the Dragon so that the world would know of the awesome power that Dracoliches possessed and to encourage the most evil and powerful dragons to accept the eternal life acquired through death.<br><br>The mortal offspring of dragons or half-dragons as they are known are also revered within the Cult of the Dragon for their noble heritage. However those who surpass death and become lich are worshiped as Avatar’s of the Dracoliches.<br><br>Advantages<br>The songs sung by the Sephim, greatest of all the angels are said to bring blessing to all that hear them. While mortal humans cannot achieve the level of angels they can influence those around them. Bard Song and Curse Song strengthen the Dracolich Avatar while weakening their opponents.<br><br>Owing to their noble heritage they possess a large number of hit points. In addition their dragon scales, bone armour and the skill tumble give a Dracolich Avatar a high armour class. They are also immune to fire, paralysis, sleep, stun, hold and critical hits.<br><br>As many a foolish adventure will attack and Dracolich and die before its awesome fury it would be wasteful to simply leave their items to gather dust. Through their bardic heritage a Dracolich Avatar has acquired the power to use a vast number of magical device that foolish adventurers brought with them.<br><br>Weaknesses<br>While the Dracolich Avatar has a reinforce hide to protect it from physical attacks it magic resistance is very low, having only its spell craft ability to protect it from spells and its fire and paralysis immunities. Also the Dracolich Avatar possesses very few buffing spells, relying on magic scroll, potions and weapons to increase its power.<br>Another weakness is that the Dracolich Avatar has only 3 attacks per round, so it has to make every attack count. Haste is useful for allowing the Dracolich Avatar to strike more rapidly.<br><br>Fighting against powerful enemies<br>•Curse song can be used to decrease your opponent’s chance of making a fortitude save by one, thus reducing their chances of surviving your attacks.<br>•Unarmed: Turn invisible, use ‘Deathless Master’s Touch’ on your opponent to instantly kill them or ‘Undead Graph’ to paralysis them.<br>•Armed: Summon an undead servant to distract an enemy, cast invisibility, sneak to the side of the enemy and use ‘Dragon’s Breath’ or ‘Improved Knockdown’.<br>•Use a keen scimitar or the spell ‘Keen Edge’ to get a critical hit 45% of the time. Even if your opponent survives a fortitude save they will suffer increased damage.<br><br>Fighting against numerous enemies<br>•Use area fire or paralysis spells from a wand or scroll to burn or trap your enemies, while your immunities will protect you from harm.<br>•Get a large number of follow you, turn around and use Dragon’s Breath.<br><br>Creation guide<br>Race: Human, <br>Alignment: Chaotic evil<br>Bard 4/ Pale Master 12/ Red Dragon Disciple 24<br><br>Stats at the start: STR =16, Dex=10, Con=16, In=11, Wis=8, Cha=13<br><br>Stats at the end: STR = 36, Dex=10, Con=18, In=13, Wis=8, Cha=15<br>Attack +39/ +34/ +29, damage 1-6 +13, critical 15-20/ x2 (with scimitar)<br>AC 42 (with full plate)<br>HP 420<br>Saves: fortitude =27, reflex =18, will =24<br><br>Level	   Modification<br>1 (BARD)   Feat: curse song, martial weapons<br>           Spells: cure minor wounds, daze, light, shield<br>           Skills: discipline +4,  Lore +4, Perform +4, <br>           Tumble +4, UMD +4<br><br>2 (BARD)   Spells: flare, expedient retreat, identify<br>           Skills: discipline +1, Lore +1, Perform +1,<br>           Tumble +1, Spell Craft +1<br><br>3 (BARD)	Feat: power attack<br>Spell: protection from alignment<br>Skills: discipline +1, Lore +1, Perform +1, Spell Craft +2<br><br>4 (PALE)	Feat: cleave<br>Stat: STR +1<br>Skills: Spell Craft +2, Lore +1<br><br>5 (PALE)	Skills: Spell Craft +2, Lore +1<br><br>6 (PALE)	Feat: knockdown<br>Skills: Spell Craft +2, save +1<br><br>7 (PALE)	Skills: Spell Craft +1, save +2<br><br>8 (PALE)	Stat: STR +1<br>Skills: Spell Craft +1, save +2<br><br>9 (RDD)	Feat: weapon focus scimitar<br>Skills:  discipline +6, Spell Craft +1<br><br>10 (RDD)	Skills:  discipline +1, Spell Craft +1, save +1<br><br>11 (RDD)	Skills:  discipline +1, Spell Craft +1, save +1<br><br>12 (RDD)	Feat: armour proficiency (heavy)<br>Stat: STR +1<br>Skills:  discipline +1, Spell Craft +1, save +1<br><br>13 (RDD)	Skills:  discipline +1, Spell Craft +1, save +1<br><br>14 (RDD)	Skills:  discipline +1, Spell Craft +1, save +1<br><br>15 (RDD)	Feat: Improved Critical<br>Skills:  discipline +1, Spell Craft +1, save +1<br><br>16 (RDD)	Stat: STR +1<br>Skills:  discipline +1, Spell Craft +1, save +1<br><br>17 (RDD)	Skills:  discipline +1, Spell Craft +1, save +2<br><br>18 (RDD)	Feat: Great Cleave<br>Skills:  discipline +1, Spell Craft +1, save +2<br><br>19 (PALE)	Skills: Spell Craft +1, save +3<br><br>20 (PALE)	Stat: STR +1<br>Skills: Spell Craft +1, save +3<br><br>21 (RDD)	Feat: Improved knockdown<br>Skills: discipline +3, Spell Craft +1<br><br>22 (PALE)	Skills: Spell Craft +1, save +2<br><br>23 (PALE)	Skills: Spell Craft +1, save +2<br><br>24 (PALE)	Feat: epic weapon focus<br>Stat: STR +1<br>Skills: Spell Craft +1, save +2<br><br>25 (PALE)	Skills: Spell Craft +1, save +2<br><br>26 (PALE)	Skills: Spell Craft +1, save +2<br><br>27 (RDD)	Feat: Overwhelming critical<br>Skills: discipline +6, Spell Craft +1<br><br>28 (RDD)	Stat: STR +1<br>Skills: discipline +1, Spell Craft +1, save +2<br><br>29 (RDD)	Feat: Devastating Critical<br>Skills: discipline +1, Spell Craft +1, save +2<br><br>30 (RDD)	Feat: armour skin<br>Skills: discipline +1, Spell Craft +1, save +2<br><br>31 (RDD)	Skills: discipline +1, Spell Craft +1, save +2<br><br>32 (RDD)	Stat: STR +1<br>Skills: discipline +1, Spell Craft +1, save +2<br><br>33 (RDD)	Feat: epic weapon focus, epic prowness<br>Skills: discipline +1, Spell Craft +1, save +2<br><br>34 (RDD)	Skills: discipline +1, Spell Craft +1, save +2<br><br>35 (RDD)	Skills: discipline +1, Spell Craft +1, save +2<br><br>36 (RDD)	Feat: great strength I<br>Stat: STR +1<br>Skills: discipline +1, Spell Craft +1, save +2<br><br>37 (RDD)	Feat: epic toughness<br>Skills: discipline +1, save +3<br><br>38 (RDD)	Skills: discipline +1, save +3<br><br>39 (RDD)	Feat: great strength II<br>Skills: discipline +1, save +3<br><br>40 (BARD)	Spell: bull’s strength, invisibility<br>Stat: STR +1<br>Skills: discipline +1, Perform +3, Tumble +38, UMD +22<br>_________________<br>Who really controls the Iron Throne?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By uanime on 03/01/05 14:04</span></i></p>

I think you should change the levels a bit and get a couple of things extra.<br><br>Bard 4/Pale Master 16/Red Dragon Disciple 20.<br><br>You lose one RDD bonus feat and some fire damage but you gain 2 PM bonus feats and gain +2 AC, use the extra feat for Epic Mage Armor.

yes, it is available.  epic PMs have access to epic spells regardless of how many spellcaster levels they have.

Thanks but there is one more thing I want to know. If I was to take my 16th level of Pale Master at a level where I normally get a new feat eg level 33, 36, 39 and I can pick 2 epic spells which ones would be most useful?<br>_________________<br>Who really controls the Iron Throne?

If you don't plan on meleeing, Hellball and Epic Mage Armour are probably best. <br><br>If you do plan on meleeing, but in a high magic environment, Epic Warding is a must. Then probably Greater Ruin for the 2nd, as it's likely that elemental DR will be available, and the only part of Epic Mage Armour that stacks is the +5 Dodge AC. In a low magic environment, I'd go for Epic Warding and Hellball.<br><br>Finally, if your PW has an improved AI hak in place, it can be worth taking Dragon Knight, as it is a very powerful summon as long as it doesn't try to cast pointless spells on the wrong targets.

Yes you can pick epic spells on levels that give feats normally as long as you are 15th (or is it 16th) level pale master. I would defiantely look at dropping your RDD levels to 10 and PM to 25, and then finally take a last level of bard in 38-40 to cap skills like UMD and tumble. This will open up a very nice demi lich pet for you as well.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>
