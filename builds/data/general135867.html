Wow. Great idea. Now that's what I'm talking about. A nice simple combo, that is realistic to play and fun.

I've built a monk/druid that focused on using monk abilities while fighting in elemental shape. It was quite a fun character. Unfortunately I can't remember what feats I took, outside weapon finesse and improved critical unarmed. I know the level split was 12 monk/28 druid.
