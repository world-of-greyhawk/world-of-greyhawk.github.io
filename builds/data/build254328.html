A 1/2 Orc template I've used in a few modules (though not taken into late epic levels as of yet). For anyone looking to play a 1/2 Orc that actually has a brain, this is a fun build to try. It's not uber by any means, but he can hold his own and get the job done. So he's good for...<br><br>PvM, from level 1 to 40.<br><br>BBN 16/WIZ 16/CoT 8<br><br>1/2 Orc TN, NG, CN, CG<br><br>STR: 18 (30)<br>DEX: 12<br>CON: 14<br>INT: 14 (18)<br>WIS: 8<br>CHA: 6<br><br>1 )BBN1: Heavy Armor<br>2 )BBN2<br>3 )BBN3: Weapon Focus<br>4 )BBN4: STR (19)<br>5 )WIZ1<br>6 )WIZ2: Blind Fight<br>7 )WIZ3<br>8 )WIZ4: STR (20)<br>9 )WIZ5: Extend Spell/ Still Spell<br>10)WIZ6<br>11)CoT1<br>12)CoT2: Power Attack/ Cleave/ STR (21)<br>13)CoT3<br>14)CoT4: Knockdown<br>15)BBN5: Improved Critical<br>16)BBN6: STR (22)<br>17)BBN7<br>18)BBN8: Toughness<br>19)BBN9<br>20)BBN10: STR (23)<br>   <br>21)CoT5: Epic Weapon Focus<br>22)CoT6: Armor Skin<br>23)CoT7<br>24)CoT8: GRT STR I (24)/ Epic Prowess/ INT (15)<br>25)WIZ7<br>26)WIZ8<br>27)WIZ9: GRT STR II (25)<br>28)WIZ10: GRT INT I (16)/ STR (26)<br>29)BBN11<br>30)BBN12: GRT STR III (27)<br>31)BBN13<br>32)BBN14: STR (28)<br>33)BBN15: Terrifying Rage<br>34)WIZ11<br>35)WIZ12<br>36)WIZ13: GRT STR IV (29)/ INT (17)<br>37)WIZ14<br>38)WIZ15: GRT INT II (18)<br>39)WIZ16: ESF:Discipline*<br>40)BBN16: STR (30)<br><br>BAB: +27<br>AB with mundane weapon: +41<br><br>AC (plate and tower shield): 28<br><br>HPs: 456<br><br>Saves (vs spells):<br>Fort: 29 (38)<br>Refl: 24 (33)<br>Will: 22 (31)<br><br>Skills (224 points):<br>Intimidate: 43 (41)<br>Spellcraft: 41 (45)<br>Tumble: 20<br>Discipline: 43 (63)<br>Taunt: 43 (41)<br>14 left over.<br><br><b>Features</b>:<br>Terrifying Rage: 5 times per day, he can make us of the Rage ability to boost STR and CON by 6 points and WIll saves by 3. He loses 2 AC. Enemies failing the save VS the Rage will either be feared or take a-2 penalty on attacks and saves.<br><br>Spells: access to WIZ spells up to level 8 for buffing, defense, and a bit of offense. Although his DCs will be very poor, there are a number of no-save spells he can use.<br><br>Decent HPs for a character with significant mage levels.<br><br>Saves are okay, but quite good vs spells, and he has some spells to cover many of the weak spots.<br><br>AC is okay as well, and the Heavy Armor feat ensures he can take advantage of the best armor available.<br><br>Slight speed boost in case things go awry (or to chase things down).<br><br>Damage Reduction. Only 2 points, so it's negligable, but still a perk.<br><br><b>Disadvantages</b>:<br><br>Low caster level, so beating SR is going to be an issue, and he's also easily dispelled.<br><br>DCs are low for his spells, so no-save sells are going to be his bread and butter as far as offensive casting goes (but there may be exceptions: see below)<br><br>Since he's a 1/2 Orc, Human could probably pull off this combo better, with the extra feat and skill points, and no ability penalties (but that's true of almost any 1/2 Orc build).<br><br>He does not get access to level 8 spells when his WIZ levels would qualify him for it, since his INT isn't boosted to 18 until <i>after</i> he levels. This isn't such a big deal, since he can learn spells from scrolls, so if he has the scrolls available, he can immediately learn the spells after levelling.<br><br><b>Suggestions:</b><br><br>*ESF:Discipline: one could opt for a different feat such as ESF:Intimidate, but this may not be necessary.<br><br>One interesting strategy to try with this character is to cast Grease and/or Web, and any other AoE spell that causes a slow effect (to slow or hold the mobs), then Mind Fog. Chances are, even with the DC of his spells, that some of the mobs are going to fail the Will save and be hit with the -10 Will penalty. Then activate Terrifying Rage, and watch them succumb to the effects. This may mean you don't need to go for the ESF:Intimidate feat.<br><br>Spells are mainly for buffing and defense though, and a focus on no-save offense spells is probably a good idea.<br><br>It may be tempting to go for the Illusion specialization, and this is probably wise, but if you want to use the Mind Fog strategy, you cannot lose the Enchantment school, as that spell falls into it. In an environment where True Seeing is available on an item, Necromancy may be a good choice of Specialization.<br><br>If desired, you can opt to alternate some of the WIZ and BBN levels, but I like the way this level scheme works out, as you get the benefits of each of the classes in a timely fashion and it tends to add to the character at an overall advantageous pace.<br><br>The only other combination like this in the Guld is TyrTemplar's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "245464", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>War Lord</a> and, while it has quite similar feat choices, the Warlock Wild goes for a different stat spread and quite different level spread (concentrating on getting more WIZ as opposed to more BBN, as this one is meant to use a bit more casting than Tyr's, IMO).<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I like Half-orc builds.  They require a bit more thought (paradoxically), and are usually quite unique.  This is no exception.  Well off the beaten path.  The nice thing about TR is that its DC is typically going to be better than most Spell DCs.  Makes ESF: Intimidate a non-essential.  The bad thing about TR is that its duration is pitifully short.<br><br>Heavy Armor could be an optional feat here, as you could fulfill the Dex gap with Medium Armor and Extended Cats.  Might free you up a bit, and maybe allow you to push 2 CoT into Epic for another bonus feat.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

with half-orcs like this, i almost want to play one.  this is a very attractive build.  true, human can probably do it better, but as a build from ground up its very strong, imo.  very nice HP for so much wiz in there.<br><br>a pretty scary monster as well, in what is the recent half-orc monster blitz.  rage seems to be all the rage. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>-cs
