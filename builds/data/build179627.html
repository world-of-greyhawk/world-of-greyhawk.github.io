Time to move some of my builds into here, I suppose. . .<br><br>I made this one to be a versatile fighter, melee or ranged. It can deliver its damage equally well with Mace or LongBow; if the enemy is sneak immune or has high DR, there is Epic WSpec on both weapons, and there is also Power Attack for melee (+2 damage from STR too). Called Shot works for both weapons too. I picked those weapons because I wanted two damage types; bludgeoning particularly to handle undead. The Exotic feat is taken early to allow any other finessed weapon in a pinch as well. And Epic Dodge for defense, of course.<br><br>The 10 COT levels were chosen for the feats, and to increase saving throws by 5 over a typical Fighter/Rogue build. Those COT levels went in early to get that boost. These Fighter/Rogue types normally have BAD Will saves. . .to also help that, I took Slippery Mind (Iron Will or Spellcraft points might be another idea). The Charisma sucks, but if a some ability-boosting items were worn, there might be some small use made out of some of the other COT feats.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I made it a single-wield build but frankly, if there is one thing this build ISNT missing, its feats.  A version with that could be made very easily, if someone decides what to drop. . . <br><br>Martial Rogue<br>Dwarven 20/10/10 Rogue/Fighter/COT<br><br>Str 14<br>Dex 18 (30)<br>Con 12<br>Wis 8<br>Int 14<br>Cha 6<br><br>1 Rogue - PBShot<br>2 Fighter - Finesse<br>3 Fighter - WF(Bow) WF(Mace)<br>4 Rogue - Dex(19) <br>5 Fighter <br>6 Fighter - WSpec(Bow) WSpec(Mace)<br>7 Rogue -<br>8 Rogue - Dex(20)<br>9 COT - Exotic Wpns<br>10 COT - Knockdown<br>11 COT <br>12 Rogue - Dex(21) ImpKnockdown<br>13 Rogue - <br>14 COT Power Attack<br>15 COT - ImpCrit(Mace)<br>16 COT - Dex(22) Cleave<br>17 Rogue <br>18 Rogue - Called Shot<br>19 COT<br>20 COT Dex(23) Great Cleave<br><br>18BAB, 8/4/8 Rogue/Fighter/COT <br><br>21 Rogue - EWF(Mace)<br>22 Rogue10 - ImpEvasion<br>23 COT <br>24 COT Dex(24) EWSpec(Mace) BlindFight<br>25 Rogue <br>26 Fighter<br>27 Fighter EWF(Bow) EWSpec(Bow)<br>28 Rogue- Dex(25)<br>29 Rogue13 - Def Roll<br>30 Rogue - Epic Dodge<br>31 Rogue<br>32 Rogue 16 - Dex(26) Slippery Mind<br>33 Fighter - Toughness<br>34 Fighter - Epic Prowess<br>35 Rogue<br>36 Rogue Dex(27) GreatDex(28) <br>37 Rogue 19 - Skill Mastery (or Crippling Strike)<br>38 Fighter <br>39 Rogue - GreatDex(29)<br>40 Fighter - Dex(30) Armor Skin<br><br>Disable Trap 40 (take 20 Skill Mastery)<br>Discipline 40<br>Hide 40<br>Listen 27<br>Move Silent 40<br>Open Lock 20 (take 20 Skill Mastery)<br>Search 30<br>Tumble 40<br>UMD 30<br><br>Ubuffed Combat stats<br>------------------------------<br>Mace AB 42/37/32 27 damage d6+8<br>Longbow AB 41/36/31/26 damage d8+6<br>Kama AB 39/34/29/24 damage d6+2<br><br>AC 30 (33 with shield)<br><br>Fort 28<br>Reflex 38<br>Will 19 (Slippery Mind rerolls on failure)<br>(do the +5 from COT show on the screen?
