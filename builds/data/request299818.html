I was wondering if anyone could cook up a street urchin kind of character.. you know, the one with the accent, pickpocketing, fist fighting..<br><br>Doesn't have to be the best build ever.. just a random thought

Lots of Rogue, maybe some Fighter. Prestige classes don't sound like they would fit your character concept because it doesn't seem very... prestigious. Then again I don't know that you would play it as a street urchin up to level 40. I would imagine one would find a way to elevate themselves beyond such status. I could go into more detail, but Rogue with Epic Dodge and enough Fighter for four attacks and EWS comes to mind.

This depends completely on how you view the character. I think Rogue is likely a given. Some FTR would be appropriate as well, I believe. Maybe Shadowdancer. Assassin if he's had a particularly heinous life. I can also see some Bard, depending on your concept. Maybe a little bit of Wizard.<br><br>Do you have a character background/concept in mind? It would make it far easier to suggest something if you do.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Yes, indeed I do have a concept! Sorry.. my posts are always very vague and noobish.. but! I think a street urchin would be a rogueish/sorcerer (very low lvl sorc) who is focused a lot more on skills than on combat.. Skills like.. bluff, appraise, pickpocket, hide, ms.. all the basic rogue stuff and more! And a little bit of spellcasting, you know.. you pick up a little here and there.. but ultimately it would be an RP build.. and most feats/skills/classes are for RP and not for combat (who said you needed to fight people to level up?)..<br><br>thanks guys!

Good idea (the Sorcerer levels). If this guy is a skill monkey and a fast talker, then I can see him having a decent CHA score. SOR would fit right in there (so would Bard). So maybe Rogue/SOR (even though Rogue/WIZ has far better synergy) or Rogue/Bard.<br><br>For the latter, I'd probably look at something like Rogue 24/Bard 16. Or maybe Rogue 18 or 19/FTR 6 or 5/Bard 16 if you want some added combat ability.<br><br>For the former, maybe something like Rogue 30/SOR 10 (you don't want him to be able to go all out with mage spells, as that wouldn't fit the concept as I understand it).<br><br>Just tossing stuff out here.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Rogue/Fighter/Bard sounds like a brilliant idea..<br><br>thought 30 rogue 10 sorc seems cool too.. ah I can't decide!<br><br>thanks Cinn..!
