I would like to see a build in regards to PVM. This character would be desgined around a single creature to fight. The info i currently have on this Creater is the following.<br><br>They fight in sets of two, sometimes four but rarely.<br><br>They are immune to magic, but not defensive spells such as death armors, acid sheeths, elemental shields, or wounding whispers, things like that. THey are not immune to Hellballs or Greater Ruins, However they usually make the saves.<br>They have ranged attacks and melee attacks Dev Crits on both.<br>Their Ac is 80<br>Thier Ab is 62<br>They're Evil.<br>They're Animals (mutated of course but the animal subtype).<br>They have Dev Crit 19-20. The Fort save is in the 40's.<br>They Have Defelect Arrows.<br>They Have Evasion (Not Epic Dodge.)<br><br><br>This servers equipment goes up to +5 for stat bumps but you can get up to from what i have seen +8 weapons. The favored class in this server seems to be Clerics. However they are working on balancing out that fact.<br><br>I would be interested to see if anyone can create a character that would destroy these monsters. They are verry tuff.<br>Thank you for your time in reading this.<br><br>-FoG

Shadow Archer. Look up the build in the build forum.<br><br>If the creature isnt hitting with magical weapons then the 30/+2 DR of the shadow along with the immunities(including critical immunity) make sure it wont go down quickly. Meanwhile pepper it with arrows. <br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

They have magical attacks probably at +6 or +8 and i forgot to mention they also have true seeing which negates HiPs. They also have 2000 hit points.<br><br>-FoG<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By _fist of god_ on 07/31/05 06:35</span></i></p>

Do they have a high discipline and concentration?<br><br>A scythe wielding paladin/fighter/WM should be able to manage an AB of 70+ with the equipment you mentioned, so should a fighter/bard/rdd (easily with curse song and taunt).   If you can land knockdown, you should be able to keep one of them out of the fight and, for the WM, the scythe crits. should be doing 200-300 points of damage per hit.  So you should be able to whittle down those HP fairly quickly.  The Fighter/Bard/RDD won't crit for as much but would have a higher Dev. Crit. DC.  The problem is that both of these builds could get hit by dev. crit.  <br><br>Alternatively, you could try something like my <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "199696", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>doom skald</a> build.  It only has an AB of 40, but with curse song and taunt he could lower that 80 AC to a 69. With Bull's Strength, a +5 to STR, Bard Song, War Cry, and a +8 weapon he could raise his AB to 55-57.  With +5 equipment he could manage a 73 AC and if you have +8 equipment he could probably get his AC high enough that the monsters could only hit him on a 20.  He would also be immune to critical hits and be able to cast epic warding which should give him some durability.  It looks like a level 40 wizard or sorcerer with epic warding and the damage shield spells is what you want.  With the equipment you described and the stats you described, for anything other than a cleric or the builds described to have a shot against these creatures, their AC would have to be 10 points lower.<br><br>You could also try a kama dual wielding monk/shadowdancer/fighter with SC V, epic dodge, improved expertise and as high an AC as you can manage.  You can probably get 9-10 attacks per round, so in a hit on a 20 situation you could average .45 to .5 hits per round.  If you could get you AC high enough that they could only hit you on a 20, with SC V and epic dodge they would rarely if ever hit you.  It would be a dex build, so it might take a couple hours but such a build should be able to nickel and dime a group of such creatures to death.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 07/31/05 09:22</span></i></p>
