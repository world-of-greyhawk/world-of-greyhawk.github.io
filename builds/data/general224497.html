I am working on a build and found that I have three extra pre-epic feats :0 .  I am appealing to the masses for advise on what to take.<br><br>Basics: <br>Monk / Fighter Build <br>Not weilding Kama's but just use his fists.<br>Dexer Build<br>Took Blind Fight, Dodge, Weapon Finesse, &amp; Toughness<br>Took all the important Melee (Focus, special, imp crit)<br><br>Now I find that I have three spots open - all in Fighter levels so the options are pretty open.<br><br>Unfortunately I dont have 13 Int so the disarm options are out.<br><br>So in your opinion what would be good feats to take?<br>Save boosters?  Initiative?  Skill focuses?<br>I am at a loss...<br>Thanks in advence for your help.<br><br>P.S. - If you need more info I can answer your questions about the build Just did not want to post the whole leveling path but I can.

Are the three feats FTR bonus feats or general feats? If FTR bonus feats your selection is not that wide. Also, why did you take dodge? Unless it's a prereq for something else (DwD, WM, SD or some other feat which requires it)it's not that useful. Btw remember ED does <b>not</b> require dodge and I think you are aiming for it being a dexer; will you take SD to qualify for ED?<br>One feat I can suggest you is called shot. Save boosters are always nice too. SF is not that big deal, I'd take it only if I have no other choice left or if I need to really max out a specific skill. Improved initiative is worth considering. That's all I can think about right now<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Oh My mistake...<br><br>I thought that when you win the initiate you get them caught flatfooted and got an AoO.

If you win initiative, your first flurry will catch them flat-footed, IIRC, but you don't get an AoO.<br><br>AoOs are generated by:<br><br>- opponent making a ranged attack<br>- opponent making unarmed attack (without Imp Unarmed Strike feat)<br>- opponent casting a spell<br>- opponent using a scroll, wand, rod<br>- opponent using a spell-like ability <br>- opponent running<br>- opponent using certain feats<br>- opponent drinking a potion (depending on your difficulty settings)<br>- opponent moving in the combat radius<br><br>there may be one or two more I haven't remembered.<br><br>Just because he's flat-footed, it doesn't mean you'll get an AoO.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

You may want to take a focus in Kama anyway. Two reasons -<br>1 - helps when facing a blunt-resistant enemy<br>2 - qualifies you for CoT, giving nice boosts to saves and more Epic feats.<br><br>That and Called Shot for the fighter feats. You could take Luck of Heroes at level 1, or add in some energy resists (acid is nice, hard to find on items. Sonic too).<br><br>TM
