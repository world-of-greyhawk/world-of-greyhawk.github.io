And conversly, if I was Bard-heavy early on, I had good buffs, but my AB wasn't too good (especially in Epic).<br><br>I decided, therefore, to just eat the feats and make a Bard that becomes more and more martial in his life of adventuring. Perhaps becoming more jaded about the Heroes that he sings about; preferring to use his own weapon instead of trying to inspire others.<br><br>One of the things I like about the build is that you get all your buffs early, when you need them most. Haste, Improved Invisibility, Mage Armor.  Then in Epic levels, you make up your AB with the Weapon Master AB boosts (lvls 5, 13, 16, 19, 22).<br><br>Advantages:<br>Bard spells<br>Bard Song<br>Taunt<br>Good Crit Damage<br>4 attacks per round<br>UMD<br>a Bard without flappy red wings!!!!!<br><br><br>Disadvantages:<br>Buffs can be dispelled fairly easily<br>Feat Starved<br>Low HP early on<br>No Knockdown<br>No Cleave<br>No Empower Spell<br>No Lingering Song<br>The saves aren't all that great, although with a high spellcraft, you can add +8 to saves against spells.<br><br>I ran it through its paces in the Novice to Epic Mod and it performed well using mundane Chanmail and a mundane Spear.  Without buff's, though, it suffered. But I guess that's to be expected in a Bard build.<br><br>Cheers.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 12/02/05 23:31</span></i></p>

a nice simple warrior bard.  refreshing to find one that is not aiming to grab everything along with divine feats and etc.  the lack of combat feats is lamentable, as are the saves, but the versatility makes it pretty strong.  this seems to be a pretty good clas split.  i could also see dropping one level of bard for a cleric or fighter level.  you would pick up heavy armour, and with a cleric you could get some umpf on the healing and/or animal summons spells.  also, you could pick up a domain power, but that seemed pointless with only 1 level.  just some food for thought.  not really important.  the reason i mention it is that without a little more AC, either from heavier armour or a shield, you will get hit very often.  without an amazing amoutn of hp, this can be a problem.  just my two cents.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>“If you bring a Ranger with you, it is well to pay attention to him...”

Interesting build. I tell ya, I'm bloody happy to see a strength-based Bard build without those floopy wings!

Especially early to take a Martial weapon. And I like the idea to push for Bard 20, so I guess I'm supporting the Bard 20/Fighter 1/WM 19 version.<br><br>While you get points for a non-RDD bard, you get bonus points for the poetic Build Title <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Nice job.<br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br>Intelligent design is neither.

There's something wrong with the WM bonus feats. The WM gets a bonus feat at level 13,16,19 and 22 (and not at 14,18,22).<br><br>Actually I like the build as it is. Not every build needs fighter levels and spear is not that bad. Perhaps go for bard(21)/WM(19) to get Lasting Inspiration. But you would lose 2 Greater STR feats and 1 AB (= 2 AB,1 damage).<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.Detail&amp;id=856" target="_blank">Character Build Calculator</a>(works with Excel, Open Office) 2.83: updated to NWN 1.69.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kamiryn on 11/29/05 06:26</span></i></p>

Thanks for the feedback and finding my feat placement mistake.  I was trying a few different revisions and forgot to fix the Epic feats.<br><br>While I agree that a level of Fighter would make the build stronger (+2 AC due to Heavy Armor, and a better selection of weapons (Greatsword or Scimitar and Shield)), I actually steered away from that for stylistic reasons. It seems that a great many people run around with either a Greatsword, GreatAxe, Scimitar or Rapier. I was trying to not only stay away from the standard RDD build but also the standard Fighter-Bard Greatsword wielding build.<br><br>But yes, it would definately make it stronger. And if anyone where thinking of trying the build out, it would be an option they should consider.<br><br>When I have more than a few spare moments I will fix the WM Epic Feat. But first I need to mull over the suggestion of taking 20 Bard levels for Lasting Inspiration. I hate to lose the +1 AB from WM 22, but perhaps it is worth it in the long run.<br><br>Thanks again for the feedback and suggestions.<br><br>Cheers.
