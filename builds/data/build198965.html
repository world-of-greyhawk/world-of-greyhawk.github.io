<b>PvM</b> build, (sort of) playable <b>1-40</b><br><br>This build is loosly based on the <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_devastatingrogue.html" target="_blank">devastating rogue</a> build by Brian "Flameoftheabyss" Quah. I was looking at it a few days ago and when i saw "The uniqueness of this build is the fact that he can deal 84d6 sneak attack damage on his first attack phase", I started wondering if it would be possible to keep a high sneak attack <i>and</i> get 4 attacks in the first attack phase. This build does just that, getting <b>116d6 sneak attack damage</b> in the first attack phase. It is barely playable but not quite as unbalanced as I feared when I started. The extra BG levels give you a summoned vrock/doom knight which greatly helps him get sneak attacks. Setting traps should also be helpful, I'm mainly thinking traps that disable enemies, leaving them vulnerable to sneak attacks. I'm almost entirely sure that this is the highest sneak attack damage you can get with maximum attacks per round, but I could be wrong. I have little experience with rogues, so I'm hoping others will be able to improve it further.<br><br><b>Race</b><br>Elf<br><br><b>Starting abilities</b><br>STR 14<br>DEX 18<br>CON 12<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 10<br><br><b>Level progression</b><br><b>1</b>  rogue 1  two weapon fighting  <br><b>2</b>  rogue 2  <br><b>3</b>  rogue 3  weapon finesse  <br><b>4</b>  rogue 4  (+dex)<br><b>5</b>  monk 1  <br><b>6</b>  rogue 5  ambidexterity  <br><b>7</b>  rogue 6  <br><b>8</b>  rogue 7  (+dex)<br><b>9</b>  rogue 8  weapon focus(kama)  <br><b>10</b>  BG 1  <br><b>11</b>  BG 2  <br><b>12</b>  BG 3  imp two weapon fighting  (+dex)<br><b>13</b>  BG 4  <br><b>14</b>  BG 5  <br><b>15</b>  BG 6  toughness  <br><b>16</b>  BG 7  (+dex)<br><b>17</b>  rogue 9  <br><b>18</b>  rogue 10  blind-fight,  crippling strike  <br><b>19</b>  rogue 11  <br><b>20</b>  rogue 12  (+dex)<br><b>21</b>  rogue 13  epic wepon focus(kama),  skill mastery  <br><b>22</b>  rogue 14  <br><b>23</b>  rogue 15  <br><b>24</b>  rogue 16  imp sneak attack 1,  imp sneak attack 2  (+dex)<br><b>25</b>  BG 8  <br><b>26</b>  rogue 17  <br><b>27</b>  rogue 18  imp sneak attack 3  <br><b>28</b>  rogue 19  imp sneak attack 4  (+dex)<br><b>29</b>  rogue 20  <br><b>30</b>  rogue 21  imp sneak attack 5  <br><b>31</b>  BG 9  <br><b>32</b>  rogue 22  (+dex)<br><b>33</b>  rogue 23  imp sneak attack 6  <br><b>34</b>  rogue 24  imp sneak attack 7 <br><b>35</b>  rogue 25  <br><b>36</b>  rogue 26  imp sneak attack 8  (+dex)<br><b>37</b>  rogue 27  <br><b>38</b>  rogue 28  imp sneak attack 9  <br><b>39</b>  BG 10  imp sneak attack 10  <br><b>40</b>  rogue 29  (+dex)<br><br><b>366 skill points, distibution suggestion</b><br>41 craft trap<br>43 disable trap<br>42 discipline<br>43 hide<br>43 move silently<br>43 search<br>36 set trap<br>40 tumble<br>35 UMD<br><br><b>---Final stats---</b><br><br><b>Attacks</b> (with two normal kamas)<br><i>normal:</i><br>36/33/30/27/24/21/36/33<br><i>flurry of blows:</i><br>34/34/31/28/25/22/19/34/31<br><i>FoB and haste:</i><br>34/34/34/31/28/25/22/19/34/31<br><br><b>Damage d6+2</b> err..<br><br><b>Sneak attack 15d6+3d6+10d6=28d6, avg 98</b><br><br><b>Totals</b> (with FoB and haste)<br>Total sneak attack on <b>first combat phase</b> 112d6, <b>avg 392</b><br>Total sneak attack <b>per round</b> 280d6, avg <b>980</b><br><br><b>Hit Points</b> 362 max<br><br><b>Naked AC</b> 27<br><br><b>Saving throws</b><br>Fort 22<br>Reflex 31<br>Will 17<br><br><br>typo's corrected <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 06/10/05 19:10</span></i></p>

Oh s**t.<br>I made a pretty significant mistake and it's too late to edit. The sneaky bastard gets only 3d6 sneak attack from BG, not 4d6, which means all the totals are wrong, and also that it is indeed possible to get better sneak attacks and 10 attacks/round using a [rogue 35/BG 4/monk 1] build, which was my original idea, but I coudn't make that a playable character, especially not at pre-epic levels. Anyway the proper sneak attack is 28d6 which means the sneak attack section should look like this:<br><br><b>Sneak attack 15d6+3d6+10d6=28d6, avg 98</b><br><br><b>Totals</b> (with FoB and haste)<br>Total sneak attack on <b>first combat phase</b> 112d6, <b>avg 392</b><br>Total sneak attack <b>per round</b> 280d6, avg <b>980</b><br><br>Hopefully this will be corrected by a mod, if so then I am sorry you had to work extra because I messed up.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By pulse cap on 06/10/05 09:49</span></i></p>

I think Grizz didn't realize you can take Improved Sneak Attack for regular feats as well and not just as rogue bonus feats, as long as you meet the 8d6 sneak prereq.  At least, that's what his comment seems to imply.<br><br>Steve

I totally see what you mean now, it's a typo but the total number of feats is right. Sorry I didn't understand your first post. The level progression for lvls 32-34 should be:<br><br><b>32</b>  rogue 22  (+dex)<br><b>33</b>  rogue 23  imp sneak attack 6<br><b>34</b>  rogue 24  imp sneak attack 7<br><br>Thanks for pointing it out.<br><br>With that I think everything is as I intended, sorry I was so sloppy with the original post.

Could be 4 (dual wielding monks are such a pain, lol).  What might help this build would be to drop two of the Improved Sneak Attacks and pick up Knockdown and Improved Knockdown.  All attacks against a knocked down opponent are sneak attacks, and you get a +4 to your AB when attacked a prone opponent as well.  So, less sneak damage, but many more potential sneak attacks each round.  Since just one extra sneak attack per round would make up for the 2d6 difference...definitely a worthwhile change in my book.<br><br>Of course, the AB isn't the best for knockdown, but at least Improved Knockdown will counteract the -4 to AB a knockdown normally gets.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 06/12/05 03:06</span></i></p>

Rather then dropping improved sneak attack however, I'd go for monk 6. Monks gain knockdown and improved knockdown at level 6, and several other feats along the way. I'm thinking the best idea would be to drop 5 BG which should allow 10 x imroved sneak attack, thus loosing only 2d6 off the BG sneak attack. Compared to dropping 2 imp sneak attack you would gain:<br><ul><br><li>Deflect arrows<br></li><li>120% speed<br></li><li>Still mind (+2 saves vs mind spells)<br></li><li>Purity of body (disease immunity)<br></li><li>1d8 unarmed damage (useless <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    )<br></li><li>+1 AC<br></li><li>+5 stunning fist/day<br></li></ul><br>...but lose:<br><ul><br><li>Inflict serious wounds<br></li><li>Contagion<br></li><li>Inflict critical wounds<br></li><li>Summoned Vrock (you still get a succubus)<br></li><li>Summoned doom knight (you still get a ghast)<br></li><li>10 HP<br></li></ul><br>Stunning fist would of course be VERY useful if it had a higher DC, but as it is it gets a DC of 29. You might want to drop some charisma and strength to raise wisdom to boost this, which would also help AC. The summoned ghast is actually not too bad, as you can (strangely enough) talk to it like an animal companion, feeding it to heal it as well as playing games and wrestling with it. I'll miss the vrock though. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">    <br><br>About the posibility of a new topic with the proper stats, I've had no input on this but i expect if I did it would be on the lines of "it's you mess, live with it" <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   So I'll just make a new post under this topic. I have to put it it together first, but it will probably be up before anyone sees this.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By pulse cap on 06/12/05 19:46</span></i></p>

I was just thinking of the way of doing it that was least disruptive to your build as is.  Monk 6 would give a number of nice things to a build of this type.<br><br>Steve

Right then. So if anyone wants to use this build with improved knockdown it should work pretty well to make it rogue 12/monk 4/BG 4 pre-epic and rogue 29/monk 6/BG 5 final. Just make sure to spend at least three of lvls 21,22,23,24 on rogue, if you don't you can't max out improved sneak attack. Apart from that you should have no problems getting the same feats.
