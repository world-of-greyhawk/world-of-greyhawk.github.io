Hopefully I haven't diluted the result too much.<br><br>And let me start by saying that this is more of a party caster.  The spell DC's are no where as effective as a dedicated caster of either class. So your goal is to provide a lot of backup and generalized spellcasting ability.<br><br>I chose the Heal and Animal domains to take advantage of the better summons and earlier Heals.  With such low strength and no combat feats, I wanted a good summons to get me through the lower levels.  And the Heal domain was to make sure that I had the sixth level slots open for Harm (and metamagic for even more).  This also let me have Cat's Grace to help with AC and True Sight much earlier, which is also nice.<br><br>The wizard was focused in Illusion School for the extra spells per day, and I focused the Spells in Necromancy for the insta-death spells, but Evocation might be a good choice as well.<br><br>Since your caster levels and Wisdom were so low, I didn't bother with the 9th level Cleric spells. If you really wanted them, you could easily take Cleric level 17 and it wouldn't effect the overall build too much.<br><br>I didn't bother with the Still Spell - AutoStill line of feats, but if one wanted, you could easily do it.  Just trade out a pre-epic metamagic feat for Still Spell and then take Cleric 17 in Epic and trade 2 Great Intelligence's and perhaps Epic Warding to get the AutoStill feats (with a little shuffling, you could get all 3 by level 24).  Just beware - that 11 STR makes encumbrance a little tight when wearing Full Plate and a Tower Shield  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>_________________<br><br>With so much dedicated towards spellcasting you wouldn't think it could melee very well.  But...<br><br>I tested this build (Novice to Epic) at various levels and was pleasantly surprised by the results.  Just for the sake of testing I tried melee-ing a fighter of the same level starting at 3 and up to 40.  With all buffs running (except for Undeath's Eternal Foe), I was able to easily overcome Fighters up to (and including) level 35. And I was equipped only with mundane robes, a mundane Tower Shield and a mundane mace.  I was quite surprised.  I think if I had Undeath's Eternal Foe or perhaps Mestil's Acid sheath running, I could easily have taken the level 40 fighter.<br><br>Against high-AC opponents (ie. high level Rogues), there wasn't much hope for straight combat.  But with their low-ish fort saves, Finger of Death worked just fine.  But, once again, this wasn't designed with melee in mind, per se.<br><br>Oh, also, if you don't mind a lower Strength, a Gnome might not be a bad choice as race, as you would get a bonus to your Con, and you would be immune to your Evard's Black Tentacles.  I just prefer Human.<br><br>___________________<br><br>One of the problems with this build, is that your spell DC's aren't all that great until you get to the end of the build; and even then, it's nothing spectacular.  However, with both Cleric and Wizard spells available, I had entirely too much fun finding new and exciting ways to dispatch my enemies.  <br><br>Harm and a Bigby hand was a favorite.  (TS+Harm+Bigby's Grasping=mmmm...)<br><br>Or use TS-IGMS-IGMS-TS-etc.  <br><br>Or if you feel like melee-ing, drop a Negative Energy Burst to lower their strength by 6 (-3 AB) and hit them with a Bigby's Interposing hand and throw on Battletide to effectively drop their AB by 15.  Then bash them for 43 damage per hit.  <i>(1d6 mace + 1d6+8 Darkfire + 1d4 +10 Flame weapon + 5 GMW + 5 Divine Favor + 4 buffed STR + 2 Battletide)</i><br><br>The choices are endless.<br>_____________________<br><br>All-in-all, it seemed a pretty decent, albiet labor intensive, build.<br><br>Pros:<br>- Spells, baby.

But you are right, there is no reason not to. If you are going to have an Epic build that you bring out for DM run epic events (or nostalgia), it should be as strong as possible.  In this regards, I think I will use Bard for the Discipline and Tumble point dumps.  I could use Monk, but when melee-ing, I would imagine that I would have my self-enchanted Tower Shield at the ready for an extra 8 AC; and Monk would negate that (or at least I would lose the Monk Wisdom AC bonus when I equipped the shield).<br><br>Also, I would agree that the 8th level Cleric spells aren't nearly as important as the proceeding levels.  My thinking was that with such low melee stats, I would need a better-than-average meat shield (hence the Animal Domain), and the 8th Cleric spells would give me a 9th level summon to carry me through until my Wizard damage spells would take over.  However, I will revise it for a 13 level Cleric and see how it looks.<br><br><br>The Right Hand of Mystra - (Cleric 13 / Wizard 26 / Bard 1)<br><br>Human<br>Playable 1-40, PvM<br><br>Str 11<br>Dex 8<br>Con 12<br>Wis 16 (17)<br>Int 17 (34)<br>Cha 8<br><br>1 Cleric - Spell Penetration, Greater Spell Penetration (Animal, Heal domains)<br>2 Cleric<br>3 Cleric - Extend Spell<br>4 Cleric - WIS 17<br>5 Cleric<br>6 Cleric - Empower Spell<br>7 Cleric<br>8 Cleric - INT 18<br>9 Cleric - Skill Focus: Concentration<br>10 Cleric<br>11 Cleric<br>12 Cleric - Craft Wand (Scribe Scroll), INT 19<br>13 Wizard 1<br>14 Wizard 2<br>15 Wizard 3 - Maximize Spell<br>16 Wizard 4 - INT 20<br>17 Wizard 5  - Still Spell*<br>18 WIzard 6 - Toughness<br>19 Wizard 7<br>20 Wizard 8 - INT 21<br><br>21 Cleric 13 - Epic Spell Penetration*<br>22 Wizard 9<br>23 Wizard 10 - Great Intelligence I*<br>24 Wizard 11 - Great Intelligence II, INT 24<br>25 Wizard 12<br>26 Wizard 13<br>27 Wizard 14 - Great Intelligence III<br>28 Wizard 15 - INT 26<br>29 Wizard 16 - Great Intelligence IV*<br>30 Wizard 17 - Great Intelligence V<br>31 Wizard 18<br>32 Wizard 19 -  INT 29<br>33 WIzard 20 - AutoStill I, AutoStill II*<br>34 Wizard 21<br>35 Wizard 22<br>36 Wizard 23 - Great Intelligence VI, AutoStill III*, INT 31<br>37 Wizard 24<br>38 Wizard 25<br>39 WIzard 26 - Great Intelligence VII, Great Intelligence VIII*<br>40 Bard 1 - INT 34<br><br>It keeps the same Intelligence score, but loses Epic Spell Focus and Epic Warding (both questionable feats.

Good variant - this sort of build has a lot of potential in my experience, it compares favorably with fighter-mage type spellswords and brings a lot of value to a party via the cleric spells.<br><br>My thoughts on using a Monk level was that in a cloth-caster build with no autostill, you wouldn't be equipping a shield anyway.  The tower shield has like 40% or 50% arcane failure attached to it (I forget how much exactly, but it's at least as much as a suit of full plate).  If you've got autostill however, there's no point in not putting on plate and a shield both (and this is the "cheap and easy" way to getting AC with +5 enchanted gear).<br><br>Either way, kudos, builds like this are a lot of fun and can surprise people with their power <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
