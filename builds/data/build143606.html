I was trying to create a character with Epic Dodge, Self Concealment V, and could use a  large weapon effectively.  There's no Dev Crit in this build, but it's still pretty good.  I used a Greatsword, but I'll also list changes I would make if using a scythe or 2 kukris.  This character is also viable to play throughout the entire course of levelling.<br><br>Human, any alignment<br><br>Stats:<br>STR 14<br>DEX 18 <br>CON 10<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br>WIS 8<br><br>Final BAB: +36/+31/+26/+21<br>Final AC: 28<br>Final Saves:<br>  Fort: 20<br>  Ref: 31<br>  Will: 15 (kinda low, but char has Slippery Mind)<br><br>Level Allocation:<br>Fighter x 6<br>Weapon Master x 7<br>Fighter x 4<br>Shadowdancer x 3<br>Fighter x 4<br>Shadowcancer x 16<br><br>Raise DEX at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32<br>Raise STR at 36 &amp; 40<br><br>Feats:<br>Level 1: Dodge, Mobility, Expertise<br>Level 2: Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>Level 3: Disarm<br>Level 4: Weapon Specialization: Greatsword<br>Level 6: Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack<br>Level 9: Improved Critical: Greatsword<br>Level 12: Toughness<br>Level 15: Power Attack, Cleave<br>Level 17: Improved Disarm<br>Level 18: Improved Initiative<br>Level 21: Great Dex I<br>Level 22: Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>Level 24: Great Dex II, Epic Weapon Specialization<br>Level 27: Great Dex III<br>Level 30: Great Dex IV<br>Level 33: Epic Dodge<br>Level 34: Self Concealment I<br>Level 36: Self Concealment II<br>Level 37: Self Concealment III<br>Level 39: Self Concealment IV<br>Level 40: Self Concealment V<br><br>For Scythe, make these changes:<br>Level 2: Exotic Weapon Proficiency<br>Level 3: Weapon Focus: Scythe<br>Level 17: Disarm<br>Level 18: Improved Disarm<br><br>For 2 Kukris:<br>Level 2: Exotic Weapon Proficiency<br>Level 3: Weapon Focus: Kukri<br>Level 4: Weapon Finesse<br>Level 9: Ambidexterity<br>Level 12: Two Weapon Fighting<br>Level 15: Improved Two Weapon Fighting, Improved Critical<br>Level 17: Disarm (or Power Attack)<br>Level 18: Improved Disarm (or Cleave)<br>(with this build, you could also switch CON and STR)<br><br>Skills:<br>Level 1: Discipline 4, Intimidate 2<br>Level 2: Hide 2, Discipline 1, Move Silently 2, Tumble 2<br>Level 3: Hide 1, Discipline 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1, Intimidate 1<br>Level 4: Discipline 1<br>Level 5: Hide 1, Discipline 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1, Intimidate 1<br>Level 6: Discipline 1<br>Level 7: Hide 1, Discipline 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 8: Discipline 1<br>Level 9: Hide 1, Discipline 1, Move Silently 1<br>Level 10: Discipline 1<br>Level 11: Hide 1, Discipline 1, Move Silently 1<br>Level 12: Discipline 1<br>Level 13: Hide 1, Discipline 1, Move Silently 1<br>Level 14: Discipline 1<br>Level 15: Hide 1, Discipline 1<br>Level 16: Discipline 1<br>Level 17: Hide 1, Discipline 1<br>Level 18: Hide 11, Move Silently 8, Tumble 16<br>Level 19: Hide 1, Move Silently 6, Tumble 1<br>Level 20: Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 21: Discipline 4<br>Level 22-24: Discipline 1<br>Level 25: Hide 5, Move Silently 5, Tumble 5<br>Level 26-40: hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1<br><br>I ended with a bunch of skill points left over, so I slapped them into Lore and Persuade and Search.<br><br>What do you think?<br>_________________<br>-------------------------------<br>"What do you fear most in the world?"<br>"The possibility that love is not enough."<br>-- Major Garland Briggs, Twin Peaks

Ok...Greatswords and Scythes are not finessable.  So why would you use them in a very heavy dex build?  The 2 kukri thing makes for a decent char, but don't use anything bigger than a rapier!

The dervish build from a few days ago does what you are looking for. He has a high strength, dev crit, and ED,SC.<br><br>Otherwise you would be as well using my swashbuckler build.<br><br>Syrath

Let's see.  Yes, Greatswords and Scythes aren't Finessable.  That was sort of the point -- could a character with Epic Dodge and Self Conceal V use large, 2 handed weapons and still be effective.  And with smaller weapons, he probably would not be.  Without levels in some class that gives sneak attack, I'm not sure that even a rapier would get the job done.  To take those levels would be to get away from what the build is about.<br><br>And the dervish build is cool, but I don't really want to have wings.  I am also bothered on some level by the fact that many of the strongest builds take RDD (or Pale Master) levels and have no real spellcasting focus at all.  I think those classes are probably some of the most powerful, but if we rely on them to make every build superpowerful, every build begins to look the same.  I was trying to do something different with this build.<br>_________________<br>-------------------------------<br>"What do you fear most in the world?"<br>"The possibility that love is not enough."<br>-- Major Garland Briggs, Twin Peaks

However I just felt that it lacked because it didnt use a finessable weapon. If you really think about it pvm (this will sum up my waffle from earlier), you do great damage with the criticals, but when it matters and you need the damage most you find yourself in the position of not being able to land a critical because your AB is too low. This kind of defeats the purpose, you do fantastic against the weaker creatures when it doesnt count.<br><br>Unfortunately melee are forced down 2 routes usually , Finesse and go dex, epic dodge, self concealment (if you can get it) lower damage , higher AC, good AB. or go strength - overwhelming crit,dev crit higher damage, lower AC , good AB.

Yeah, I agree that a Finessable weapon would be superior.  And you're also right when you posit difficulties at higher levels.  Just from the testing I've done, that's the case.  <br><br>I also think it would be neat to have a DevCrit equivalent for Dex characters -- sort of a "Precise Critical".  But I understand why there's not -- Dex melee characters get to play at not being hit, Strength melee characters get to hit stuff really hard.  I might be more satisfied if DevCrit could only apply to twohanded weapons.  Again, it's an aesthetic thing, but still kinda annoys me.<br>_________________<br>-------------------------------<br>"What do you fear most in the world?"<br>"The possibility that love is not enough."<br>-- Major Garland Briggs, Twin Peaks
