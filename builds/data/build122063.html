Dual wielding makes better use of the +6 damage from Epic Weapon Specialization than a 2-handed weapon. Even dual wielding Longswords, (with the -4 penalty for large weapon in the offhand) I'm more likely to land 4 hits than I would with Longsword + shield or Longsword + small weapon. In a low magic world, an Exotic double-bladed sword might be better for the lighter penalty, but 2 magic weapons or a magic shield are more likely to turn up where I play and gives me twice the possibility of having nice buffs on them versus using one giant 2-handed weapon. Of course axes would be more dwarfy, but I'd rather crit more often than crit 1x harder. This is mainly a PvE build and it needs good equipment, but just about anything you find you'll be able to use with UMD maxed out, and that could be enough to work in some PvP worlds. It should be very playable as you build it, not just as an end-game build. Rogue levels are sprinkled early on to keep tumble maxed and UMD high. I plan to use this guy as my first build on Neversummer 4 as soon as it opens.<br><br>Flexibility: Some of the feats can be tailored to your preference. Devastating Critical is outlawed where I play, so I didn't go for it, but this build could easily obtain it with some feat-shuffling. I'm tempted to throw out the Overwhelming Crit and Great Cleave for Expertise or an Elemental Resistance or 2 myself. I originally had this as a 22 STR, 21 CON build with 24/- total damage reduction, single wielding a great axe / great sword, but didn't like the damage output.<br><br>Strategy: Sneak (if you can) up on the casters, knock them down and shred them to ribbons with sneak attacks. Worry about the cronies second. Tumble is high enough to dance around in combat unhindered until all the casters go down; you're never flankable or caught flat-footed, and once its down to the henchlings, you can kick in the dwarven stance, kick *** and take names.<br><br>Weaknesses: Spells, though this is shored up a bit through +2 saves as a dwarf, DD getting Will as a primary save, slippery mind, and decent reflex saves from rogue levels and feats. A haste item would be handy for getting to those pesky finger twiddlers in a hurry and convincing them to take a quick dirt nap. Spellcraft to 20 would be worth the 40 skill points spent, especially since they are in abundance. (IGMS has been nerfed some on NS4 I believe, tho to what extent I don't know - but hopefully I'll have the HPs to survive a couple castings) The other weakness is dependance on good equipment, though its built to take advantage of about anything you can buy or find. Initiative may not be outstanding. Is Imp. or Sup. Initiative worth having over a few strength points?<br><br>Any suggestions? Critiques? Modifications? I've read through the entire excellent character build thread series the past 2 weeks and considered many builds, but I think I've settled on this one... for now anyway<br><br>(Yes, I read every post!)<br><br>Edited By Lego_90 on 03/30/04 16:06:30

ACK! I just realized my poor dwarf forgot to take Imp 2 weapon fighting! I'll have to remedy that. Probably will drop overwhelming crit to get it.<br><br>EDIT:<br>Ok, I fixed it by putting Improved 2 weapon fighting where power attack is, and moving Cleave, Great Cleave, Knockdown and Imp. Knockdown all down a notch and removing Underwhelming Critical.<br><br>EDIT 2:<br>Doh, If I remember correctly, that 14th level of DD can't take Imp. Knockdown, only epic stuff... I may have to shuffle a few more things around.<br><br>Edited By Lego_90 on 03/30/04 16:55:45

Ok, I've worked out the miscalculations and kinks and built this guy this morning. Any comments or suggestions are welcome!<br><br>Elite Battledwarf / Dwarven Troubleshooter<br><br>"This highly trained unit is the dwarven equivalent of a navy seal and a bunker-buster missile. He sneaks into the heart of the enemy fortress with his lock picking skills and unexpected stealth, and then in true dwarven style, explodes into action, eradicating the enemy from the inside-out. The wisest of dwarven kings have long used these Elite Troubleshooters in times of war, when standard dwarven brute-force needed to be applied from unexpected angles. Properly equipped for their mission, or left in the field to acquire and survive on whatever resources they find, these dwarves rarely fail in their duties."<br><br>Fighter/Rogue/Dwarven Defender - 8/14/18<br>Lawful Neutral<br>Str 18-&gt;30<br>Dex 14-&gt;15<br>Con 12<br>Int 14<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 6<br><br>1:Rogue1 [1d6 SA](Dodge)<br>2:Fighter1(Weap Focus: Longsword)<br>3:Rogue2 [Evasion](2 Weapon Fighting)<br>4:Fighter2 (Ambidexterity) : DEX 15<br>5:Fighter3<br>6:Fighter4 (Weap Spec: Longsword)(Toughness)<br>7:Rogue3 [Uncanny Dodge, 2d6 SA]<br>8:Fighter5 : STR 19<br>9:DD1 (Imp.

Quote: <br>    That said, you might want to trade your longsword in for a scimitar, even without Dev. Crit. the extra criticals may be useful. You may also want to trade slippery mind for skill mastery, that will help you with UMD and set trap attempts made during combat.<br><br>    You may also want to consider taking a two-handed weapon (you have a 30 STR) and dropping ambidexterity, two-weapon fighting, improved two-weapon fighting and great strength for mobility, expertise, spring attack and whirlwind attack. By leaving your dex at 14, you can still increase your STR to 30. Whirlwind attack with sneak attack and a two-handed weapon can be nasty.<br><br><br>Yeah, scimitar would give better crit range for slightly lower damage, as would rapier, and I'd save two BAB penalty there as well, but Longswords are common to find and I can probably find 2 different ones I like for the variety, so I went with the practicality aspect rather than banking on finding that uber rapier, and then getting two of them.<br><br>As for the two handed weapon, I ruled that out with specialization damage and being able to apply it more often, coupled with more chances to hit when dual wielding and thus more sneak attack possibilities as well. Consider a tough opponent where only the first two attacks would likely hit (assume -10 and -15 for 3rd and 4th main hand are too much of a penalty to hit). Dual wielding longswords gives me 2 average attacks of 20.5 (4.5 longsword avg + 16 str + WS) and two off-hand attacks of 15.5 (4.5 + 11 1/2 str + WS) for a total of 72 average damage in the round. Compare that to only two average attacks with a greatsword at 28.5 each (7.5 avg + 21 1.5 str + ws) = 57 average damage.<br><br>-If only the highest BAB attack would hit, the ratio is 36 dual wield vs. 28.5 great sword.<br>-If 3 would've hit, the ratio is 92.5 dual wield vs. 85.5 great sword.<br>-If all 4 would've hit, the ratio is 113 dual wield vs. 114 great sword.<br><br><br>So the only time the 2 handed weapon wins is against weenie opponents where all 4 hits would strike, and then only by one point of damage per round. Epic Weapon specialization tips the balance in favor of dual wielding in all other cases. In the middle ground where perhaps 3 great sword swings would hit when only the first 2 of each dual wield would hit (due to the dual wield BAB penalty) then favor swings to the greatsword again, 72 vs. 85.5 (which when dual wielding longswords, is -4.. almost a full BAB penalty for the next hit level). The greatsword also wins out if damage reduction is 15-20 or greater as well. All in all, it's fairly equal... maybe in the long run the 2 handed sword would win out for damage, but longsword wins to me for the possibility of 2 magic items with bonuses (2 longswords or longsword + shield) whereas the greatsword is only 1 item, and the 1 handed weapon has the possibility of turtling down with a shield for defense and maintaining the wepaon focuses and specializations.<br><br>I appreciate the feedback though... you've got me reconsidering again...<br><br>Edited By Lego_90 on 04/01/04 12:04:49
