Hey all.<br><br>Can someone point to a good throwing axe build that has good consistent damage (ie. not reliant on sneaks only, though sneaks are nice)<br><br>I was thinking:<br>Bard/Rdd/Fighter (High Str, EWS)<br>Bard/Rdd/BG (High Str, divine might, limited sneak)<br>Ranger/Bard/RDD (High Str/bane of enemies)<br><br>What are your thoughts? Anyone already have the perfect thrower?

I can't think of any off the top of my head but a halfling gets <a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Good_Aim" target="_blank"> Good Aim </a> as a special ability at creation. <br><br>Something with RDD would probably be good as throwing axes automatically have the <a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Mighty" target="_blank"> Mighty </a> property on them and RDD will let you have nice stats in both dex and str. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"><br>_________________<br>Spirit, It is the hero's strength, the mother's resilience, and the poor man's armor.

If you want an RDD axe thrower, a monk sor rdd is nice.  Say, 26 4 10.  With the right ability score allocation, you can actually fit Devastating Critical on it.  It won't have a very good DC (the minimum, actually), but everyone rolls a '1' now and again.  Bear in mind, all throwing weapons use your dex modifier for ab, not your strength, so if you do make that one, and do want Dev, just make sure you have the minimum strength score, and put the rest of your points into dex.  Elf works best, but I've seen it done with halfling too.  Also, add silent spell for more true strikes.<br><br>Another good one that I like better than the RDD one, is a cleric cot monk, with zen archery.  You can last a lot longer in a fight when you can heal yourself, and have many, many options available to you.  Plus, cleric buffs will add +8 damage per hit, and war domain will add even more.  There are several different ways to build it, and several different level splits that can accomodate whatever you want.  29 Cleric 10 CoT 1 Monk is common.  <br><br>Really two ways to make that one.  One way is to forego all the CoT until epic levels, and use all the CoT bonus feats for great wisdoms.  You can hit 50 wisdom this way (assuming you have capped +12 gear and/or buffs), which makes for a nice high ranged ab.  Sadly, you lose 1 apr that way, and theoretically 1 ab, but the ab you make up in higher wisdom.  25 + 20 (wis) +5 (axe) +4 (feats) +1 (size) +1 (good aim) +8 (bless, prayer, aid, battletide, divine favor) = 64 (+6 War Domain = 70).  Not too shabby.<br><br>If you want more attacks per round, take 4 CoT pre-epic.<br><br>Another popular level split is 26 Cleric 8 CoT 6 Monk.  More often than not, people use that level split for a dual kama build, but it works for the halfling axe thrower as well.<br><br>Another fun one is a Ranger 26 Rogue (or monk) 3 Wiz 11.  You get some wiz spells, Bane of Enemies, enough skill points to set traps and/or corner sneak.  Ranger 26 Shadowdancer 10 Wiz 4 is fun too.<br><br>Hope those help.<br><br>Edit: oh, and for extra nice damage, Cleric 26 Ftr 8 Monk 6 with EWS.  With cleric buffs and EWS, that's +14 damage per hit.  War Domain will even 6 more for a short duration, for +20 damage.  Ouch!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Hiwatt on 01/17/08 18:09</span></i></p>
