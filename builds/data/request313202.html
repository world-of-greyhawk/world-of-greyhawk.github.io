I'm requesting for an elven STR-based build. I'm finding it hard to create on for myself because of the Favored Class which isn't at all favorable. I tried a FTR/WIZ/ASN, but it felt lacking. <br><br>And don't ask why Elf. :3

Would a Fighter/Weapon Master/Rogue or Bard work? If so, at what point are you willing to eat an experience penalty?

There are many options.  You dont need 2 base classes.  You could take fighter/cot/wm.  Or what about ranger/bg/wm!  In either of these there is no xp penalty.  Think outside the box.

Ranger Wizard Assassin has some nice synergies if you go Intelligence based. You get some decent skillpoints to distribute to your ranger stealth, which also translates to bonus spells and a higher DC for your death attack. If your level one slots are full of true strike, you can easily land a whole lot of high DC death attacks two handed in one round.

I can think of quite a few cases where a cleric definitely isn't the best.<br><br>To the OP: what sort of build do you want?  Any str-based, or do you want something more specific?  Any str-based leaves open the idea of Bard/Fighter/RDD, Fighter/WM/Rogue (or Assassin), Paladins, Barbarians, hell, even nearly pure rogues with a few levels of fighter.  What do you want to play?

Actually, any decent build with decent saves and AB. Spell casting is optional but warmly welcomed.
