I have been interested in the Sacred Fist class for a while, and noticed that there weren't any builds for it here, so I figured I'd give one a shot.  The key to this build is making your wisdom work some major overtime.  As a monk, your wisdom boosts your AC.  As a cleric, your wisdom boosts your spell DCs and gives you more spell slots.  From the Intuitive Attack feat, your AB is based on your wisdom rather than your strength.  And the Sacred Fist ability Sacred Flame adds your wisdom modifier (as well as your Sacred Fist class levels) to your damage for 1 minute (this build can use it 6 times a day).  Here is the build:<br><br>Yuan-Ti, Lawful Good (must be this alignment)<br>STR 14<br>DEX 14<br>CON 12<br>INT 16<br>WIS 26 (all stat boosts go to WIS)<br>CHA 14<br><br><br>1: Monk(1) - Dodge<br>2: Cleric(1) - Magic and Trickery Domains<br>3: Monk(2) - Intuitive Attack<br>4: Monk(3)<br>5: Cleric(2)<br>6: Cleric(3) - Combat Casting (need 8 Lore by this point)<br>7: Sacred Fist(1)<br>8: Sacred Fist(2)<br>9: Sacred Fist(3) - Weapon Focus (unarmed strike)<br>10: Sacred Fist(4)<br>11: Sacred Fist(5)<br>12: Sacred Fist(6) - Practiced Spellcaster(Cleric)<br>13: Sacred Fist(7)<br>14: Sacred Fist(8)<br>15: Sacred Fist(9) - Improved Critical(unarmed strike)<br>16: Sacred Fist(10)<br>17: Monk(4)<br>18: Monk(5)<br>19: Monk(6)<br>20: Cleric(4) - (need 20 Lore by this point)<br>21: Sacred Fist(11) - Epic Weapon Focus(unarmed strike)<br>22: Sacred Fist(12)<br>23: Sacred Fist(13)<br>24: Sacred Fist(14) - Great Wisdom I, II<br>25: Sacred Fist(15)<br>26: Sacred Fist(16)<br>27: Sacred Fist(17) - Greater Spell Penetration<br>28: Sacred Fist(18) - Epic Spell Penetration<br>29: Sacred Fist(19) - (need 20 Spellcraft by this point)<br>30: Sacred Fist(20) - Epic Skill Focus(Spellcraft)<br>31: Sacred Fist(21)<br>32: Sacred Fist(22) - Great Wisdom III<br>33: Sacred Fist(23) - Epic Skill Focus(Lore)<br>34: Sacred Fist(24)<br>35: Sacred Fist(25)<br>36: Sacred Fist(26) - Great Wisdom IV, V<br>37: Monk(7)<br>38: Monk(8)<br>39: Cleric(5) - Great Wisdom VI (need 42 Spellcraft here)<br>40: Monk(9)<br><br>Final Skills: Concentration 43, Discipline 43, Hide 43, Lore 37, Move Silently 43, Spellcraft 42, Tumble 40.<br><br>From your monk levels, you also get Cleave, Stunning Fist, Knockdown/Improved Knockdown, Evasion/Improved Evasion, and Purity of Body, and a few other less important ones.

Clothed means some relatively moderate (I think) equipment for a level 40 character: Boots of the Sun Soul +5, Periapt of Wisdom +5, Ring of Protection +5, Robes of the Dark Moon, and Gloves of the Hin Fist +5.

She can cast powerful damaging spells on a group while rapidly pummeling the most powerful enemy to death.  She can also sneak in very rapidly, through her own stealth abilities and Improved Invisibility, coupled with Monk Speed. and beat an enemy to death before being seen.  And she has extremely high AC, making her very hard to hit.  I've only played around with it a bit, but it's fun to watch her dismantle dragons in a single round before they even know what hit them.  Anyway, enjoy <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .<br><br>Steve

Doesn't intuitive strike count towards the +20 AB limit you get from magical items?

Yes, which is unfortunate <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> .  His AB would be a lot higher if it didn't.  That's why I didn't bother with the epic spell Deadeye Dense.  It doesn't increase the AB any further.  But, the fact that it's a monk and thus the AB decreases at a slower rate helps a bit.  I can't speak for PvP (that's not what I play), but this thing beat the crap out of all the enemies I put up against it, and with groups, it can use spells to help take out your enemies (or use word of faith to blind them too) and then beat down on the big baddies.  I should try it out against a prismatic dragon out of curiousity...hrm, I may do that now...<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 05/01/05 03:07</span></i></p>

The prismatic dragon battle is a bit drawn out (maybe 2-3 minutes), but an easy victory really.  The dragon cannot affect me with his spells or breath weapon (Yuan-Ti SR plus high saves plus Improved Evasion), and he can't hit me except on a 20.  My character can hit him just slightly more easily, but has many more attacks per round.  Also, even when the dragon does connect, it's all absorbed by Epic Warding, whereas the majority of my damage isn't subject to the dragon's damage reduction, since it's mostly fire/divine.  And this was without attempting to use any offensive spells at all, just going at him with fists.  I ended up not taking any damage during the battle.  So, bring on the dragons, <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> .<br><br>Steve
