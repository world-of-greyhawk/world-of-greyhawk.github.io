Hello all I am looking for a server that is based on the dragonlance world. Does anyone have a clue which one might be a good choice for me? I like heavy story and lots of rp, but I really like to get down and dirty in a good action server as well... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">  Help would definatly be nice. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

It's mid to high magic. That's the biggest problem with the server IMO, but it will be better from the day it is ready for NwN 2.<br><br>You can count on around +7 weapons and such, plus immunity items.<br><br>Another problem, it still runs 1.66............<br><br>Even with the high magic I have had quite some success with my Dragonshape.

Dragonlance is now running 1.67. Seems the cause of the delay was that a builder had to add her new areas before they could update, thatt was ready a week ago. then the server host changed owner, so it took another week, but now it's good.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Good news indeed.  I was playing there and another pw, and upgraded for the other pw since I have been with them longer.  Glad to see I can start playing at Dragonlance again <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.
