I know there are several of these builds from Syrath (sp?) running around, but I just wanted to ask if it was possible to do a rogue/SD/WM and get these all of these feats.<br><br>He's gonna be a dagger master, and i'm taking weapon finesse, ambidexterity, two weapon fighting, and improved two weapon fighting... the server also allows for advancing all the way to lvl 40.<br><br>Any thoughts on this would be great, including possible starting stats... or am I deluding myself?<br><br>Bradon

Rogue/SD/WM was the very first build I played and yes its possible.<br><br>First off Id play ELF with 20 DEX .<br><br>Level up to level 12 Rogue , level 4 SD and level 4 WM. This means you will be taking feats .<br><br>Level 1 Dodge<br>Level 3 Mobility<br>Level 6 Weapon Focus(Dagger)<br>Level 9 Expertise (level 8 switch to SD for 4 levels)<br>Level 12 Spring attack<br>Level 13 Improved Evasion ( Rogue Bonus)<br>Level 15 Whirlwind Attack (level 16 switch to WM, take it to 20 to gain normal attack no 4)<br>Level 18 Ambidexterity<br>Level 21 Shadowdancer Two Weapon Fighting <br>Level 22 Rogue - bonus feat -epic Dodge<br>Level 23 WM 5<br>Level 24 WM 6 Improved 2 Weapon Fighting DEX =26 <br>Level 25 WM 7<br>Level 26 Rogue 14<br>Level 27 Rogue 15 Great DEX 1 (27)<br>Level 28 WM 8 DEX = 28<br>Level 29 WM 9 <br>Level 30 WM 10 Great DEX (29) <br>Level 31 WM 11<br>Level 32 WM 12 DEX = 30<br>Level 33 Rogue 16 SC 1, SC 2<br>Level 34 Rogue 17 <br>Level 35 Rogue 18<br>Level 36 WM 13 SC 3 , Epic Weapon Focus<br>Level 37 WM 14 <br>Level 38 WM 15<br>Level 39 Rogue 19 SC 4, SC5<br>Level 40 WM 16 Superior Initiative <br><br>Depending whether you want max discipline, or max stealth or max rogue skills you can switch the last rogue and wm level.<br><br>Unfortunately due to feat restrictions at lower levels DW is pretty much impossible. <br><br>Syrath

Good starting stats 14 INT 20 DEX, 12 STR, 10 CON, 8 WIS 8 CHA<br><br>You need the int and dex for feats. It pretty much leaves little for the other stats.<br><br>Syrath

Awesome, I was thinking more rogue than weapon master and Halfling instead of rogue. Maybe I can fudge the numbers alittle since I forgot to specify that.<br><br>And if I don't get that 4th attack by lvl 20 it won't be the end of the world.<br><br>Thanks for the info though Syrath.<br><br>Brandon

I wouldnt mess with the early levelling too much. Take more shadowdancer and you lose Rogue levels. Take more Rogue and you wont be primed to get the SC feats at the right time (you have a 5 level gap instead of 3 for rogue bonus feats at level 19 - 24, then its every 3 levels) So reducing the WM level is slightly problematic. The WM levels give you +4 to your AB as well (level13,16 bonus ab and epic weapon focus, WM bonus feat). <br><br>Syrath

Yeah, I started looking at the spread for epic rogue feats (1 per 4 lvls) as opposed to the WM epic featss (1 per 3 lvls) and it looks like I wouldn't get all the feats needed.<br><br>Also noticed that I said, "...halfling instead of rogue." <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>Brandon<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By sirjenixofbj on 01/23/05 21:46</span></i></p>

You could take halfing instead of elf since it meets the same starting stats. <br><br>Kind Regards<br><br>Stuart

So, Syrath, any suggestions for possibly making this work for a halfling kukri-master?<br>I've been trying some builds but I always come up one feat short to start taking WM lvls at 17-20. If this can be done (rogue 12/SD 4/wm 4) at 20 with kukri, it'll be a rebuild of a character on an epic server, and not taking weapon finesse until after lvl 20 won't matter.<br>I beleive this build could be done with a human, in fact I know it can. But as a halfling it just doesn't seem possible to squeeze in an extra weapon proficiency in time.<br>By taking:<br>1  dodge<br>3  mobility<br>6  expertise<br>9  spring attack<br>12 whirlwind<br>15 exotic weap  <br>And no weapon focus <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br>Am I missing anything or am I screwed?

It cannot be done with a human due to the lower dex score. It cannot be done with a halfling due to feat requirment for WM. You just cant take exotic weapons. <br><br>My suggestion is to stick with daggers. The kukri really only makes a difference on a very small range of d20 required to hit. Other than that dagger /kukri are identical. <br><br>If you really wanted a kukri master halfling you would need to go fighter instead of WM or rogue. Or you can drop the 4th attack and take wm levels later.<br><br>Syrath
