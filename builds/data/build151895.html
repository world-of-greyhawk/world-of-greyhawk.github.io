This is another build for Imp Invis/Epic Dodge, which thanks to syrath I now love, and prefer quite a bit to SC V not only because it saves tons of feats, but because it gives you other buffs including death immunity spells, which I don’t like to leave home without.<br>I didn’t see anything similar to this in the epic builds, except of course for the bard/aa/sd builds. The main difference here is lower ab in exchange for higher level spells, more slots, and most importantly to me, immunity to death magic. In fact I took 15 wizard instead of 13 just to squeeze out some extended shadow shields. If you prefer the extra 1ab/1damage, go for it, and remember you only need to end up with 17 int in this case.<br>Since this is only my second time using Epic Dodge (or SD, for that matter) in a build, any suggestions would be appreciated. The same would be true of my Quicksliver [working] build. Incidentally i'd like to know how to make links in this forum.

With SD lvls your Tumble skill should be high enough that you should never trigger attacks of opportunity, so Mobility seems pretty useless.

With 13 lvl of Rogue you can get access to Epic Dodge as well, plus you get 7d6 sneak attacks to help your damage, as well as more skill credits (especially if you start as a Rogue).  If you were to do something like Rogue 13/Wizard 17/AA 10 you would have a much more damage build that could cast 9th lvl spells, although you would lose a couple points of AB.  You would also lose HIPS, which is kind of nice, especially for an archer build.

Remember however to get the same feats as a shadowdancer a rogue must be 16th level instead of 10. 2 are a must defensive roll and imp. evasion. Slippery Mind is questionable whether you really need it. The loss of hips is quite a big loss in many cases however, and in others choosing rogue would give you an xp penalty (e.g. fighter/COT/shadowdancer). However additionally someone might just not want to be a backstabber, I like stealth builds but Im not a particular fan of either the rogue class due to the fact it has sneak attack , and Im not a fan of rangers either. I do like dex based fighters though.<br><br>Syrath

The most important to boost is fortitude, and I'd give a lot of consideration doing the epic res: fire instead of epic will to guard against darkfire/flame wep. Ultimately those choices are up to you to make, since they don't affect the structure of the build in any way. This is true of most of my builds.. I usually like to leave some room to breathe as far as feats are concerned (which is why I would never want to go for SC5).<br>And yeah, I tend to prefer SD to rogue for the reasons syrath pointed out. But going for lv9 spells wouldnt be a terrible idea, if you're willing to sacrifice 1 ac 2 ab and 1 damage for 2 9-slots and i think 3 8-slots.<br>Thanks for the critiques and suggestions; love to hear any others people might have.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?
