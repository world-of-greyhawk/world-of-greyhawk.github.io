I play at a pvp server, and the characters there are all designed to be munchkinism (not the best way to say, but you get my point). There is one guy who is a monk. I dunno what he combined with it, but his AC is so outstanding that it's hard to land a hit. I've built a couple of chars,but nothing will kill him (also, he has incrediable custom built items). Should I fight fire with fire, and build a monk of some sort? If so, what should I combine with it? I was thinking monk/sd so I could get epic dodge. Lemme know what you think.<br><br>~Nelos~<br>_________________<br>You can't kill what was simply never there. . .

If he has a high ac, maybe try a 10 monk/1 wiz/29 arcane archer, can get a HUGE ab with them. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Well, he's probably a dex-based monk/rogue or monk/sd, maybe with some fighter levels. If you can't hit him at all I presume he has ED, since otherwise you would at least be hitting on natural 20's every few rounds. <br><br>Given that he has spent a lot of feats on Great Dex, Epic Dodge, and probably taken at least 5 SD to qualify for ED, his SR is probably not that high (I would guess he has 10 Epic feats, and took EWF, Epic Prowess, Armor Skin, Epic Dodge, and probably at least 2 Great Dex, only leaving at most 4 for Imp SR, so SR is probably no more than 45 + 8 = 53). So I would try for a near-pure caster with all of the Spell Penetration feats. Wiz 39/Rogue 1, Wiz 38/Rogue 1/Fighter 1, Sorc 38/ Pal 1/Monk 1, or Sorc or Wiz 40. Cast Epic Warding, Mestil's, and Elemental Shield, then start shooting Bigby's Crushing Hands, IGMS, and/or Ice Storms around, and with your spell penetration of 44-46 some of them are going to hit him. It only takes 1 Bigby's to penetrate his SR to end the fight. Mordenkainin's Sword and Black Blade of Disaster are good things to use as well.<br><br>Other builds you could consider: Fighter 10/WM 28/rogue 2 for high AB and Dev Crit, Kail's Jormungandr Dragon Shape build, or a Fighter/Rogue/SD build to try to sneak attack him (use your UMD to cast True Sight on yourself so you can see him). <br><br>I don't recommend Arcane Archer - yes, the AB is high, but monks get Deflect Arrow, plus with ED that means your first 2 shots automatically miss, add in Empty Body and probably only 1 or 2 shots per round will even get to roll to see if they can hit him. <br><br>TM

I presume that this build is using fists! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  I may be wrong but it seems logical...so an AA would be pointless - deflect arrows <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> ...on a PvP server I play on I have a 24 Monk / 5 SD / 11 Cleric...nothing can really hit me in combat with my 83 AC, Epic Dodge &amp; 50% natural concealment...I just run around with Invisibilty Purge as well so any1 Invis gets pissed off as well...<br><br>With items to boost my fort to a point where Dev. is ineffective, &amp; enough spellcraft to make the saves versus spells difficult Implosion &amp; spells with reflex saves become pointless...I don't like Icestorms, however the +110% speed from Haste &amp; monkspeed makes me very very difficult to target...+ the 34 spell resistance does help a lot<br><br>...however that doesn't mean that I like fighting mages...those Acid Sheaths can be very damaging <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">  so normally I'll just turbo out of there and find another target <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> <br><br>...when I have to fight another monk however, especially another with Epic Dodge, we usually go at it for a while, however then both just kind of give up and agree that it is pointless!<br><br>the one real thing that is the bane of my build however are sneakers! Knowing this I have a listen &amp; spot of 80+ so anything with enough move silent / hide will be effective, maybe something like:<br><br>Monk 10, Rogue 4, Ranger 26, take enough FEs to cover the 5 main PvP races (human, elf, dwarf, halfling &amp; half-orc), for feats make sure you have bane of enemies, stealthy, skill focus hide/ms, epic skill focus hide/ms, these, combined with the ranger bonuses give +20 for starters, then you can cast camoflague as well, + you have Woodland Stride outdoors...<br><br>If you say that they are mostly halfling you are fighting, you could be really untoward and abuse the 6 second exploit: spot/listen skill checks are only made every round when not in detect mode, so if you have enough monk speed you can run off to a Corner, hide come back, hit &amp; run off again before they have had a chance to detect you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">  very annoying however it works!!!<br><br>...well I help that helps...<br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!
