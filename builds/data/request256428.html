I'm looking at making a Blackguard for the PW I play on (level 30 max), but not too sure which other classes/class to have with the Blackguard. I'm mostly interested in PvP but also want a character that is playable 1-30.<br><br><b>Some info about the server that I play on:</b><br><br>Devastating Critical is enabled but requires lvl 27+<br><br>All summoning spells have been given upgrades<br><br># The Epic Fiendish Servant feat grants the fiend the following benefits:<br><br>    * Duration is doubled<br>    * Strength +4<br>    * Armor Class +1 / Blackguard Level<br>    * Regeneration +1<br>    * Bonus Feat: Improved Evasion<br>    * Spell Resistance = 5 + Blackguard’s Level<br><br>1st – 14th Succubus Warrior<br>15th + Balor Lord<br><br>The blackguard has been given these additional spells:<br><br>Corrupt Weapon<br>The caster corrupts a melee weapon to strike true against good opponents, granting a +1 enhancement bonus and 2d6 negative energy damage vs. good.<br><br>Demon Flesh<br>The caster grows the thick, leather flesh of a demon, granting a +1 natural armor bonus to Armor Class for every five caster levels (at least +1, maximum +4).<br><br>Aura of Despair<br>Beginning at 3rd level, the blackguard radiates a malign aura that causes enemies within 10 feet to take a -2 penalty on all saving throws.<br><br>Veil of Shadow<br>Swirling wisps of darkness obscure the caster's form, granting a 20% concealment bonus.<br><br>Darkness<br>All creatures within the area of effect are shrouded in a haze of darkness which can only be pierced using Ultravision. The creator of the zone of Darkness is able to see as normal.<br><br>Deeper Darkness<br>This spell functions like Darkness, though the shadowy illumination lasts 1 turn per caster level.<br><br>Abyssal Might<br>The caster summons evil energy from the Abyss and is imbued with its might. The caster gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity. The caster's spell resistance improves by 2.<br><br>Unholy Sword 	<br>This spell transforms the caster's melee weapon into a powerful Unholy Avenger, a specially blessed weapon that, when wielded by a Blackguard, acts as a +5 unholy weapon that dispells on hit.<br><br>All these spells require a Wisdom score of 11 for the first Blackguard spell to 14 for the level 8 Blackguard spell; Unholy Sword.<br><br><br>Also there is a book available that gives a further upgrade to Blackguards with the Epic Fiendish Servant feat giving the Blackguard a very powerful summon.<br><br>Any build suggestions would be very much appreciated, i've tried making a few builds in my character gen module but none of them turned out decent!

Seems the Bg has received a nice and much needed upgrade. You want Dev-Crit? If so, a Fighter Combo would probably serve you best along with Rogue or bard. A bard heavy build could very well work too. Cleric could be nice with that WIS you get and is a cool combo to have with BG. I'll give it look and see what I can come up with.

Thanks for the replies, there are no build restrictions that I know of. <br><br>I like your build Kali but the only problem is that a lot of people on the server have Devastating Crit with DC's around 37, it would be possible with your builds fortitude save to save against it but quite tough. Is there any way possible I could get his fortitude save up a bit higher without losing too much?

Well, I think your better bet is to worry about Dev Crit against something focused on it.  I don't know what sort of save boosting items you have, but a level 30 Half-Orc RDD build could have a Dev Crit DC of 45 (10 (base) + 15 (level) + 14 (38 STR) + 6 (+12 STR items)).  + 12 Con items + 10 Fort ring would give you a 36 Fort save, which is nice against those aforementioned 37 DC Dev Critters as you only fail on a 1, but against the RDD you could probably throw on some +12 Cha gear as well and have a nicer 42 save.  (honestly, a 45 is unlikely, 43 or 44 being moreso, but you're still only dying on 15% of hits, at least.)<br><br>*coughs*<br><br>At any rate, are you married to the longsword?  Depending on the weapon +s and the AC +s it might be better to go with a scimitar for the increased threat range since you're building for Dev Crit.

RDD has been changed on the server:<br><br>1. At RDD level 3 you’ll get your Dragon Breath Weapon, which can be used thrice per day to breathe a cone of Fire, 20-feet long, dealing 1d10 fire damage per RDD level;<br>Reflex Save DC 10 + RDD Level + Constitution modifier, for half damage.<br><br>2. Your draconic benefits have been balanced as follows:<br>2.1. At RDD level 4 to 9 you’ll get a –1 penalty to Armor Class; and<br>2.2. At RDD level 10 you’ll get a –2 penalty to Armor Class, 50% Vulnerability to Cold damage, and –4 penalty to Strength.<br><br><br>I think there are +5 Rings of Resistances available and probably with buffs I could easily get the fortitude save high enough to save nearly all the time.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By kaihoa on 10/24/06 00:33</span></i></p>

Would a Bard/Palemaster/Blackguard be any good?

I was thinking, with the changes to blackguards on my server (+4 AC) and the AC bonuses from the palemaster with immunity to sneak attacks, crits etc... could it be a decent character for pvp? he would probably have tons of AC <br><br>maybe something like 8 Bard 12 Palemaster 10 Blackguard<br><br>the only thing i'm not too sure about is on the page where it has how they have changed the blackguard it says:<br><br>The caster grows the thick, leather flesh of a demon, granting a +1 natural armor bonus to Armor Class for every five caster levels (at least +1, maximum +4)<br><br>what does it mean by caster levels? is that just the level of the player or how many levels the player has in Blackguard?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Eh-eh I was about to suggest the same, but with a different split. Stop PM at 10 and go Bard 10/PM 10/BG 10 maybe.<br>The caster lvl is BG lvls. Is it Natural Armor or Natural Armor Enhancement the bonus you get?

You should be able to cast 4th lvl spells easily, you've got the spell slots of a 15th lvl bard there thanks to PM. BTW you can metamagic into 5th lvl spellslots too.<br><br>Reducing CHA to 13 means -1 to saves and no access to 4th lvl spells.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 09/25/06 11:58:10 (GMT) by xitooner<br><br>I find its better to be flexible, THINK, and know your enemy.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Looking at the RDD changes, I think the intention is to nerf their strong points a bit and bolster their weakness (breath weapons in this case, as they do 10d10 at level 10 now...  And the DC looks way better on the breath than before as it is modified by a buffable statistic and ramps up way more quickly.

I'd say drop IC for Great Cleave (and maybe go Scimitar so the crit range loss is minimized... unless you already planned on using scimitar of course <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  but anyhow, your crit range should suffice); you can drop another feat of your choice, of course. Then take Great STR I instead of EP and change Armor Skin and Great STR to Overwhelming Critical and Devastating Critical. You'll face no XP penalties with any race by the way, this build's got 2 PrCs. <br><br>It's not like your DC will be that high so I don't think it's worth it.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 09/25/06 11:58:10 (GMT) by xitooner<br><br>I find its better to be flexible, THINK, and know your enemy.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->
