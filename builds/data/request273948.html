1. Description of my character.<br><br>Master of the sword-fighting and archery, my hero is the typical Aragorn or Faramir.  He swings his mighty sword, only one sword, mind you, and either has a sword and shield or greatsword.  He loves the longbow.<br><br>He stands up to his enemies and resists their attacks.  He excels in knocking his enemies down to the ground and finishing them off their, and he resists their own attempts to bring him down.  He knows how to use healing kits fully to help his friends.<br><br>---My idea of my hero is a character who is speedy and strong, using his strength to cleave his enemies and using his quick reflexes as am additional advantage to staying alive and hitting his foes.---<br><br>2. How I like to play NWN.<br>I like to fight with swords and bows.  Swords are what I mainly like to use, and I use the bows while a)beginning my attack b)picking damage off targets and c)running away while shooting an occasional arrow.<br><br>I like using combat moves.  I love knocking down enemies, and using whirlwind attack on them.<br><br>=====<br>Well, that's it.  I'm not good at making builds, so I hoped someone could come up with one for me.<br>=====<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By nuame on 05/16/07 02:10</span></i></p>

Well, how's something like, 12 Fighter, 22 Weaponmaster, 6 Monk sound?  You'd wield a Greatsword with deadly skill, wear robes (or any cloth armor) with decent AC, and have moderate AB with a bow (40ish with a +5 longbow).<br><br>I can lay it out, if it's something you sound interested in.  A cool build though, to be certain.

mantis, that would be great!  and it does sound cool.  when I first started NWN, I used monks advantages with my love for melee fighting.  i just couldn't figure it out, though, lol.<br><br>but yes, that would be great <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>[edit] i'd also like the build to be playable from level 1.  another challenge of course.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By nuame on 05/16/07 11:48</span></i></p>

How important is speed here? there are two main ways to get speed, which is Haste or Monk, I don't know if your PW has perm-haste armor, if it doesn't either a Cleric or a Wizard/Sorcerer can get you the spell and a lot of buffs for melee power.<br><br>Damage is complicated when going both melee and ranged, since ranged AB goes with DEX, normally you use Aracne Archer do add damage, but to add to both I think bane of Enemies or Sneak attack are the best, you could go something like Fighter 6 / Ranger 21 / Rogue 13.<br><br>A Paladin 20 / Wizard 2 / Arcane Archer 18 or similar can also do a lot of damage with Divine Favor, Greater Magical Weapon (for melee) and Divine Might along with its CHA buffs.<br><br>What I really need to know to make a build for you is the magical setting, exactly what enhancement level are we talking about for both weapons and armor and how are immunity items, perm-haste and stuff in your server.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 05/16/07 15:38</span></i></p>

Original campaign?  As in the non online kind?<br><br>It's been so long since I've seen an OC player... it's like a Lunar Eclipse.<br><br>(I'm not saying that in an insulting fashion.)<br><br>I'd vote Paladin/Monk (and maybe add some Champion of Torm).

I once wanted a character like this, too.  Equally comfortable with sword and bow.

Original Campaign can also be played multiplayer Bromium.<br><br>And by the way, I can make a Lunar Eclipse to you anytime, I found the OC to be perfectly fine to play, I prefer it to several online servers or extra modules or whatever, it's quite ok in my opinion.<br><br>Not into magic!? well, too bad, magic is great for this kind of builds... let me know if you ever change your mind and I'll pop up a good build, anyway, grizzled_drawflord's build is very good, check it out at least for reference is a must.
