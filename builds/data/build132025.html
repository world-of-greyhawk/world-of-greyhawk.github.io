<b>True Champion of Torm</b><br><br>This character is about as buff as a melee character can get.  Has lvl 9 cleric buffs, divine shield/might and 6 attacks/round.  I find it the ultimate pvm character for me.  In pvp against other melee character it holds it's own, with 46 fort saves(higher buffed) you can stand up to almost any dev crit.  As with most cleric build this character will really hate to be dispelled, luckily the monster ai isn't smart enough to dispell you.  This character is very powerful on a low magic server, but still scales well in a high magic one.  If you hate late blooming characters or characters that make no sense role playing-wise then this char will be a nice switch.  If your server has permahaste items, I'd pick a tickery or healing instead of travel.<br><br><br><br>20 Cleric / 18 Champion of Torm / 2 Paladin<br><br><b>Starting Stats</b><br>Str - 14<br>Dex - 8<br>Con - 14<br>Int - 10<br>Wis - 14<br>Char- 16<br><br><br><b>Leveling Order</b><br>13 * Cleric (War, Travel)<br>2 * Paladin<br>5 * Champion of Torm<br>Epic<br>5* COT<br>7 * Cleric<br>8 * COT<br><br><b>Feats</b><br>1 Power Attack, Divine Shield<br>3 Extra Turning<br>6 Divine Might<br>9 Cleave<br>12 Extend Spell<br>15 Weapon Focus Longsword(or whatever weapon you want)<br>17 Improved Critical Longsword *<br>18 Extra Smite<br>19 Knockdown *<br>21 Epic Weapon Focus Longsword, Great Wisdom 1*<br>23 Great Wisdom 2 *<br>24 Great Charisma 1<br>25 Great Wisdom 3 *<br>27 Great Charisma 2<br>30 Great Charisma 3<br>33 Great Charisma 4<br>36 Great Charisma 5,  Epic Prowness**<br>39 Great Charisma 6<br>40 Armor Skin **<br><br>* COT bonus feats<br>** COT epic bonus feats<br><br><b>Stat points</b><br>Wisdom at lvl 4, 8<br>Charisma at remaining levels<br><br><b>Ending Stats</b><br>Str - 14<br>Dex - 8<br>Con - 14<br>Int - 10<br>Wis - 19<br>Char- 30<br><br>Without buffs (Full Plate, Scimitar, Tower Shield)<br>32/27/22/17<br>24 ac<br><br>With Buffs<br><br>68/68/68/63/58/53 (51/51/46/41/36 long term)<br>AC 57<br><br><b>HP</b><br>Without Buffs<br>20 * 8(cleric) = 160<br>20 * 10(Pal&amp;COT) = 200<br>2 * 40 (Con) = 80<br> = 440 hp<br><br>Buffed<br>20 * 8(cleric) = 160<br>20 * 10(Pal&amp;COT) = 200<br>8 * 40 (Con) = 320<br>1 * d8 = 8<br> = 680 hp<br><br>Fort - 46 (64 - buffed)<br>Reflex - 36 (53)<br>Will - 42 (54)<br><br>32 Spell Resistance<br><br>High Damage - GMW, Str, Darkfire, Prayer, Divine Power, Divine Might, Divine Wraith etc<br><br><br><b>Advantages</b><br>Huge AB<br>Huge AC<br>Huge Dmg<br>Offensive Spells<br>Tons of Healing Spells<br>Immune to tons of things (including Death attacks, fear and mind spells)<br>Long Term Buffs<br><br><b>Disadvantages</b><br>Dispelled == bye bye<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By evo_dragon on 05/28/04 19:11</span></i></p>

I think instead of War domain, Trickery or Strength would work a lot better.<br><br>Otherwise... this build is eh ok. I don't consider its AB "huge"; it's fairly good though; but if a server has nerfed divine favor and/or divine power, this build will have a bit more trouble than usual.<br><br>~ Lock<br>_________________<br>"Life builds you up just to tear you down." - 3rd Strike<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Lockindal on 07/31/04 02:59</span></i></p>

I can't think of a better pvm character on a lowish magic server(+5 at lvl 20) than a combination cleric/fighter.  Pvp is more a focus on a high magic server that makes it relatively easy to get to lvl 40, this character doesn't do as well there.<br><br>For most servers I would go trickery and war, for a high chr build I find war to be a better choice then strength.  Especially since it is quite easy to get that +12 str with all the clerics buffs.  As far as divine favour and power goes, I haven't played on a server that nerfs them so I can't really speak to that.

I should also mention this build is virtually immune to dev crits, and most death magic.  It's massive fort save of 46 base will stop anyone with the base strength of 42.  You can only obtain higher strength with a half orc rdd build starting at at least 19 str.  Since charisma is the focus of this build I will undoubtably obtain the +12 chr items to match anything a dev critter would equip.  To become totally immune to dev crits all I need to do is get +1 fort save, or activate divine wraith.  Either way when you activate divine wraith you won't be affected by ANY DC spells or abilities.

What is the reason to taken Pallie levels evo?  Is it for Aura of Courage?

It's mostly for the CHA bonus and the aura liek you stated. Also another level of COT or cleric adds nothing to the class, where as you got aura with paladin.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

There's a ton of builds like this one, such as my own Dazzling Battle Cleric or someone else's (sorry can't remember the name) Battle Priest of Torm.<br><br>I guess great minds think alike, since builds like these are incredibly powerful for PvM, especially in party play. You're immune to so many things, and your spells can do the same for the rest of the party. Plus you can heal other party members. You're everyone's friend!<br><br>One thing I do like in virtually all Cleric builds is Zen Archery. It makes the build much more versatile in party play. If you have plenty of meatshield party members, you can sit back and plink away with Divine Might on, while concentrating on healing / resurrecting the others.
