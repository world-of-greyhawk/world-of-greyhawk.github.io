Another entry to please the 1/2 Orc fans. Fairly standard Rogue build in many ways, but with a few extra goodies. A dual-wielding STR-based character with a good skill set and the ability to sneak around to deliver sneak attacks, lay traps, and generally be a pain in the butt. Only one other build in the Guild with this class combination (and actually has exactly this class split), [/url]<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "240435", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Harper's Blessed Sneak /Rogue 25/CoT 10/Harper Scout 5</a> by I…Samphus, but it's a Human and is DEX-based.<br><br>If one desires, it's easy enough to switch this character to a two-hander and utilize the STR to greater effect.

Harper Scout extras are a bonus and the feats help to round out the skill set and saving throws to acceptable levels. <br><br>One nice bonus of combing HS and the 10 CoT levels is the save boost from Tymora's Smile is a nice +6 as opposed to +2, due to an in-game (undocumented) synergy between the classes. Thus, he can boost his Fort and Will saves to 32 each, and the Reflex save to 37 without any gear. As well, he also has +2 on saves vs mind spells from Lliira's Heart, for a potential of 34 Will save (vs mind spells) with no items. Take that, Enchanters!<br><br>He can disable all traps in the game, and is able to recover and set all but Epic traps.<br><br>The AB is good when dual-wielding, and he can sword and board if needed to add 2 more at the expense of 2 attacks per round.<br><br>Damage is good without sneaks, even when dual-wielding (+12 mainhand, +6 offhand).<br><br>High Discipline makes him solid on his feet, and pretty tough to Disarm as well.<br><br>Some drawbacks include:<br><br>-no IKD. He doesn't qualify, due to 12 INT, but he still has KD and a good AB, so he's still dangerous in that regard.<br>-the first 10 levels require careful play and tactics, as he's restricted to light armor only and cannot use a shield, so his AC is going to be low as a result. Once he grabs his first CoT level, he'll be able to use a shield (if needed) and wear scale or a chain shirt (which is what he's intended to wear).<br>-low Open Lock. Since he's a 1/2 Orc, he gets shafted on the skill points unless he wants to spend big on ability points at creation. Still, he's quite well-rounded in his skills, and Open Lock is quite easily boosted through items. As well, points could potentially be raided from UMD if one desires to get it higher (or Disable, if you don't care about disarming epic traps).<br>-UMD is not maxed, but 25 points should still be high enough to use pretty much anything he finds.<br><br>All in all, a pretty effective Rogue build with some 1/2 Orc style.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 10/13/06 20:07</span></i></p>

I really like this template (I recalled liking Samphus's Harper's Blessed Sneak as well). What's not to like?  Half-orc, heavy sneak damage, heavy strength, good saves, great skill set, can Stealth, lots of gimmicks.  This is a worthy addition to the Harper's, and the Guild.  <br><br>Now, all we need is a Half-orc Paladin/Sorcerer and we'll be set.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Always nice to see a good harper scout.  It's also really nice to see a build that makes good use of scale-class armor and a dex bonus, since back in my PNP days my fighting characters tended to favor the more convenient (we used encumberance rules and sleeping in armor was a no-no) medium armors over the heavy armors.  Finding a treasure and being unable to carry it out in one trip was bad enough, but it really, really stunk to be wearing plate armor and fall into some water.<br><br>I wouldn't be worried about open lock, I have a feeling that few doors or chests could resist this guy's bashing for long.  UMD however, is something that I'd try to find points for.<br><br>This guy looks like a decent character for using an exotic double weapon with, if only just for kicks.  I like the double weapons, for style, and a half-orc rogue with a double mace would give a whole new meaning to the term "leg-breaker."<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

My thoughts echo Xylo's.  I like not using the heaviest of armours.  It seems a little too easy in NWN to get that full plate.  this stuff is supposed to be expensive and heavy.<br><br>And the first 10 levels...the average rogue doesn't have superb AC for a little while anyways.

This is a very impressive Rogue build (and a half-orc too!). I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the saves. Don't you think Slippery Mind would do this one good, though? His Will isn't half bad and rerolling might actually make a difference.<br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a>

Thanks for the replies, all.<br><br>Xylo: good point on the Open Lock. Perhaps a single point in it to be able to use the skill, then the rest into UMD. Although I still think 25 UMD is going to allow him to use most of what he finds, more is always good. Exotic weapons is an interesting angle as well, but what to drop in order to fit it in?<br><br>Christian: good point on the first 10 levels, which echoes my sentiments. I just thought it would be wise to have a bit of a warning up that they aren't going to be a cakewalk.<br><br>Finn: You're right about Slippery Mind. This is one of those builds where it may actually be useful. However, he gets +2 vs mind spells anyway (Lliira's Heart), and can boost saves with his Tymora's Smile ability. Also, there are very few spells with the descriptor 'Mind Affecting', which lessens the utility of Slippery Mind (it only activates vs 'mind-affecting' spells, not for all Will saves), and Will is also one of the easiest saves to cover with items/spells. Still, as noted, this is a character that may actually get some use of the feat.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Required feats take up a lot of the build... the only things that look like candidates for dropping in favor of exotic weapon prof are Toughness and Knockdown... both of which are better for performance than just using a double weapon.<br><br>Which in a nutshell describes the problem with double weapons, you have to be a strength build that still has 15+ dex to use them, and on top of that you have to have a feat to burn.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
