If you're an AC Monk then you would do better to raise Wisdom than Dexterity, since you don't have Uncanny Dodge, all your DEX AC can go to hell when flat-footed, but Monk WIS AC works even when flat-footed (AB is not an issue, Zen Archery works instead of Weapon Finesse).<br><br>Also, shouldn't you be able to cast level 9 spells?

The entire Spring Attack line of feats are pretty much useless when you can dump 40 Ranks into Tumble.  Expertise and Improved Expertise are pointless, too.  Hardly anything can hit you without them.  <br><br>Removing just those would free up room for Weapon Focus and Improved Critical: Kama.  You'd also have room for Ambidexterity, Two-Weapon Fighting, and Improved Two-Weapon Fighting.<br><br>Lose a couple of those Epic Spells and EER's, and you can get Epic Weapon Focus and Epic Prowess.  Add Silent Spell somewhere in there, and you can slot 10+ True Strikes.  That way, you can actually hit and kill things occasionally.<br><br>Otherwise, why even bother with Weapon Finesse in the first place, when you totally miss out on +4 AB from feats?

You don't have much casting power with only 3 levels behind your spells.  Even Greater Magic Weapon is useless as a spell.  You don't have the demi-lich to make up for the lack of spell abilities, a high level cleric will dispel ALL your buffs with a single spell, and you don't give an intelligent enemy any reason to hack at you first.
