I usually played assasins by building up dex. (And for fun str. or even dex and str.) But I have never built an assasin which built up intelligence. It would seem that a rogue/wizard/assasin could be an interesting play even with an int of 14 and some buffs I made the death attacks quite frequently. In other words, it seems to me that an extremely high DC for death attack is not worth it. Am I wrong in this analysis?<br><br>If anyone has ideas for a rogue/wizard/assasin I would be interested. I would focus a good deal on traps and buffs to handle critical immune/no sneak attack type of enemies.

I've always been a fan of the Monk/ Assassin/ SD (RP'd as a member of the Order of the Shadows serving Mask) Fun to HIPS and move fast as most normal characters. With E.Dodge it's really fun... of course you have to focus less on Wis maybe going, Str 14, Dex 16, Cons 10, Wis 14, Int 14, Char 8... something to look at.<br><br>And yes... Death Attacks are effective... I remembering being in a party with a powerful mage and they'd Mass Blind/ Deaf and I'd DA and deal damage like a beast with my M 9/ A 26/ SD 5... oh that was fun. But more fun than anything and remember that DA's only work if the enemy is not in combat or a few other situations that disable them from fighting back. (not teaching lesson on assassinations)
