about how many caster levels is enough for pvm and pvp? thinking about making a character with only 21 levels of caster, no spell penetration feats.<br>_________________<br>Where we belong, there's no one to hurt. It's someplace we can't be felt. Where we belong it's darker than space, a feeling that we all push down until we can't be found

25 levels can be beneficial to avoid dispelling. Depending on the server you might want to be able to penetrate spell resistance of 32 on items. Pure Clerics and Druids can get 52 but you can lower it by 10 with the mage spell Mordenkainen's Disjunction. The formula to beat SR is caster level+d20.

<b>From nwnwiki:</b><br><br>Spell resistance (SR) is a special defensive ability. When a spell is cast against a creature with spell resistance, the caster rolls a die (with the modifiers described below). If the roll is less than the the creature's spell resistance, then the spell does not affect that creature. Spell resistance is like armor against magical attacks. <br><br>Spell resistance does not stack -- only the highest SR item or spell counts. Spell resistance (other than that from diamond soul) can be temporarily lowered via the spells Mordenkainen's disjunction, greater spell breach, lesser spell breach and nature's balance. <br><br>The roll to beat spell resistance is <br><br><i>Caster level + 1d20 + spell penetration modifier. </i><br>The spell penetration modifier is 2, 4, or 6, for spell penetration, greater spell penetration, or epic spell penetration respectively. <br><br><br>The spell called Spell Resistance confers the following amount of spell resistance: <br><br>Caster level + 12. <br>The spell resistance that a monk receives from the feat diamond soul is: <br><br>Monk level + 10. <br>For every improved spell resistance feat taken, spell resistance increases by a further +2. <br><br>Retrieved from "http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/ Spell_resistance"<br>------------------<br><br>Difficulty Class (DC) is a number that determines how hard a particular action is. When a character's action has a DC, that action will only be successful if the character rolls a d20 (20-sided die), adds all relevant modifiers, and ends up with a number that is equal to or greater than the DC. If the result is less than the DC, then the action fails. (So the higher the DC, the harder the action.) <br><br>//snip//<br><br>Saving throws<br>Another action associated with a DC is an attempt to avoid a harmful effect (e.g. a spell, trap, or aura). This attempt is called a saving throw. <br><br>When a spell allows a saving throw, the DC is determined by the spell level, the caster's primary ability modifier, and the caster's feats, as follows: <br><br><i>DC = 10 + spell level + ability modifier + feat modifier. </i><br>The feat modifier is +2 for spell focus, +4 for greater spell focus and +6 for epic spell focus. The feat modifiers are not cumulative. <br><br>.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...
