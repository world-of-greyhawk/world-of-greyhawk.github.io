The concept here is to make a tank that can protect your party and still deal significant damage with one weapon.  I tried to balance offense and defense as best I could.<br><br>To be honest, I have moved many feats around and for anyone wanting to make this character, you have a lot of freedom.  I had power attack and cleave in there but removed it.  I also flip flopped between 2 more str or 2 more con but decided on str.  Heal skill is a must with all the HPs you will have - I know this first hand. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>The biting wall can crit well over 100(buffed) and maybe even more with the proper gear.  Grab a keen War Axe and turn yourself into a ravaging machine!(Against anything not immune to crits)  I noticed a significant lack of Dwarf builds with the Dwarven war axe.  This is partly why I had to take 10 ftr levels pre epic.  Yes you could trim it down to 8 but I wanted 10 so you could have some good feats while leveling pre 20.  This is a PvM build after all.<br><br>Have fun and comments/suggestions welcome!<br><br>P.S. Don't forget to take 4 Intimidate at level 10!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 09/06/05 19:08</span></i></p>

I personally like both Dwarves and the DD class, But from my experience, 41 AB in a build that cannot buff itself is a bit low. Your easiest path is to drop all CON above 22, and put it to STR, for 80 hp's less, but 2 more AB and dmg. I feel it's worth it. You will land more crits that way to. And don't worry about crit immune, you deal enough damage. And well, yeah, you can buff, in the Defensive stance, but it is easily disturbed, and the extra strength will be worth it anyhow IMO. Other than that a fun, solid guy that will easily hold his own in PvM.
