Hello. This is a build I'm working on.  He is a caster cleric that uses his wisdom for many things: spell dc's, monk ac bonus, zen archery ab, spell slots.  He also is capable of reaching 50 wisdom (with +7 from items) so this entails a +20 boost in ab and ac, very high spell dcs and lots of spell slots.  He also is able to search for and disarm high dc traps and open high dc locks due to his high int score (more skill points) and trickery domain power.<br><br>Human, Lawful Neutral<br><br>domains: plant and trickery<br><br>str 8<br>dex 10<br>con 10<br>wis 18<br>int 16<br>cha 8<br><br>1. cleric. toughness, spell focus (evocation)<br>2. cleric<br>3. cleric. greater spell focus (evocation)<br>4. cleric. +1 wis<br>5. cleric<br>6. cleric. zen archery<br>7. cleric<br>8. cleric. +1 wis<br>9. cleric. extend spell<br>10. cleric<br>11. cleric<br>12. monk. empower spell, +1 wis<br>13. cleric<br>14. cleric<br>15. cleric. maximize spell<br>16. cleric. +1 wis<br>17. cleric<br>18. cleric. silent spell<br>19. cleric<br>20. cleric. +1 wis<br>21. rogue. epic skill focus (search)<br>22. cleric<br>23. cleric<br>24. cleric. epic spell focus (evocation), +1 wis<br>25. cleric. great wis 1<br>26. cleric<br>27. cleric. great wis 2<br>28. cleric. great wis 3, +1 wis<br>29. cleric<br>30. cleric. great wis 4<br>31. cleric. great wis 5<br>32. cleric. +1 wis<br>33. cleric. great wis 6<br>34. cleric. great wis 7<br>35. rogue<br>36. cleric. great wis 8, +1 wis<br>37. cleric<br>38. cleric. great wis 9<br>39. cleric. greaet wis 10<br>40. rogue. +1 wis<br><br>final attributes:<br>str 8<br>dex 10<br>con 10<br>wis 38<br>int 16<br>cha 8<br><br>skills at 40:<br>concentration: 42<br>disable trap: 43<br>open lock: 43<br>search: 43<br>set trap: 5<br>spellcraft: 41<br>tumble: 40<br>umd: 21<br><br>equipment:<br>robe<br>shortbow<br><br>spell dc's at 40 (base + spell level + wis mod + feats)<br>no items, thus wisdom is 43 with maxed owl's buff<br><br>hammer of the gods (10 + 4 + 16 + 6 = 36)<br>flame strike (10 + 5 + 16 + 6 = 37)<br>blade barrier (10 + 6 + 16 + 6 = 38)<br>destruction (10 + 7 + 16 = 33)<br>earthquake (10 + 8 + 16 + 6 = 40)<br>firestorm (10 + 8 + 16 + 6 = 40)<br>storm of vengeance (10 + 9 + 16 = 35)<br>implosion (10 + 9 + 16 + 6 + *3 = 44)<br><br>*implosion gets a bonus +3 dc for some reason<br><br>rogue skill dcs at 40:<br>disable trap:<br>43 base skill points<br>5 int bonus (16 base + 5 max fox's = 21 int)<br>19 trickery domain power<br>1 prayer<br>2 synergy from 5 ranks in set trap<br>------------------<br>70 + take 20 = 90<br><br>open lock:<br>43 base skill points<br>1 dex bonus (10 base + 2 cat's potion = 12 dex)<br>19 trickery domain power<br>10 thieves tool + 10<br>1 prayer<br>-------------------<br>74 + take 20 = 94<br><br>search:<br>43 base skill points<br>5 int bonus<br>19 trickery domain power<br>10 epic skill focus (search)*<br>1 prayer<br>--------------------<br>78 + take 20 = 98<br><br>* I took epic skill focus (search) because I'm not sure if you can take 20 on search checks.

This build has evasion, but has a mediocre reflex save.  Use +dex and +reflex save items to improve the performance of evasion.  This build also has uncanny dodge, so dex bonus to ac will not be lost when flatfooted.  +dex also helps the open lock skill.<br><br>+7 Int from items.  This will help out the disarm trap and search skills.  +5 from maxed fox's will do the rest.  It is good to have items that give +7 int, ready to swap when you need to search for or disarm high dc traps.<br><br>Spell Recommendations:<br><br>lvl 9:<br>max blade barrier<br>implosion<br>undeath's eternal foe<br>silent mass heal<br><br>lvl 8:<br>mass heal<br>max flame strike<br><br>lvl 7:<br>creeping doom<br>greater restoration<br>max hammer of the gods<br>word of faith<br>resurrection<br>silent harm<br><br>lvl 6:<br>harm<br>heal<br>ext improved invis<br>ext true seeing<br>ext spell resistance<br>ext battletide<br><br>lvl 5:<br>ext divine power<br>ext freedom of movement<br>max owl's wisdom<br>max fox's cunning<br><br>lvl 4:<br>death ward<br>ext neg. energy protection<br>ext prayer<br>hammer of the gods<br>emp endurance<br>emp bull's strength<br>greater magic weapon (for buffing others)<br><br>lvl 3:<br>ext aid<br>protection from elements<br>prayer (extra for lockpicking/searching/disarming)<br>darkfire (for buffing others)<br><br>lvl 2:<br>ext entropic shield<br>ext shield of faith<br>barkskin<br>ext bless<br><br>lvl 1:<br>protection from alignment<br>divine favor<br><br>This character is a bit of a pain to level up from lvl 1.

I've lvled this char to 21 on a pw that I play on.  I noticed one thing that I thought I should mention.<br><br>At lvl 12, switch to using a single kama for attacks.  Don't use a heavy crossbow.  The heavy crossbow made me feel like I was in slow motion, with only one attack per round.  The kama can take advantage of the monk's attack schedule. Which means 3 attacks at 12, all the way up to 5 attacks at 20. You can also cast darkfire and greater magic weapon on the kama.  Divine power raises your strength to 18, so 8 str is not a liability.  The char has reasonably high ac from the wisdom bonus (especially if you find +wis items), so he can melee very nicely with his kama, provided that his buffs are active.<br><br>I recommend using ext bless, ext aid, ext prayer, ext divine power, ext battletide, divine favor (bugged, so extending doesn't increase duration), empowered owl's wisdom (or maximized or normal depends on how much +wis equipment you can find) and maximized bull's strength (in case divine power wears off, you'll have 13 str instead of 8 )   <br><br>At level 21, his AB is 39 with his kama and he slices through everything.  His AC is 43 with all buffs and items (I have +6 dex items and +9 wis items)<br><br>As he continues to level to 40, I predict that his AB will be too low to hit hard monsters with his kama.  For tough encounters, switch to a shortbow and plink away.  He should be able to hit most things with his zen archery enhanced AB.  Divine power combines well with a +4 mighty shortbow.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By jjjhhhlll on 12/06/04 17:06</span></i></p>
