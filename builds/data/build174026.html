ok guys, im really excited about this build, but dont want to start him on my PW server and find out about all my mistakes at level 30. Could you let me know what you think?  I have to keep the 20 monk levs for server rules.  And we have a very different skill point set up, Im sure i have those right.  The Champion of Torm and Rogue levels i could switch however they work better.  I've built this one with fighter instead of COT, and its close enough to even that i cant really pick.  I know the cot without a char bonus is different, but items on server are plentiful.  Here is the order of lev and feats i chose.  Oh, I played him as halfling (would consider different, but only for big advantage)<br>start stats<br>s 12<br>d 16<br>c 14<br>w 14<br>i 12<br>ch 10<br><br><br>1-15 monk (solid base to build from)<br>16-20 cot (to get the full 4 attacks)<br>21-28 rogue (get those sneaks and skill points)<br>29-33 monk (gotta grab those higher immunities)<br>34-40 cot (up the lagging ab)<br><br>feats were taken in this order<br>weap finesse<br>ambidextrous<br>two weap fighting<br>dodge<br>mobility<br>weapon focus(Kama)<br>imp 2 weap fighting<br>imp crit (kama)<br>spring attack<br>epic weapon focus (kama)<br>imp innitiative<br>superior intiative<br>toughness<br>epic prowness<br>epic dex<br>epic toughness<br>armor skin<br>epic toughness 2<br>epic dex 2<br>epic dex 3<br><br>ended with ab 26/ sr 30/ fort save 32/ reflex 39/ will 29<br><br>All ability raises went to dex for an end of 28.  <br><br>Thanks for the help (I hope, hehe)  Im kinda new to this so dont hold back on how bad i screwed him up... There is potential in this build though right?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Sidious Fell on 01/06/05 03:35</span></i></p>

IMO you should have went for monk 20 /CoT10/ Rogue 10 . Taking defensive roll at rogue level10 . This gives you the prerequisite for epic dodge (as long as you have 25 DEX).<br><br>Syrath

I thought of that split, although i was thinking of it for crippling strike instead.  Is defensive role a much better way to go?  Otherwise, do you think this build would be a good combo for pvm or pvp?  And cot makes more sense than fighter in a item filled pw right?  Thanks alot for your help. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

34-40 COT is not going to improve your ab unless you get feats from the class. <br>After lvl20, all classes progress 1 ab per 2 levels.  Instead; consider 10 COT before lv20(I think this is possible, as you should have +7 base attack at monk lvl10) , and go the rest as monk and rogue.... just my humble opinion.  This will give you a 17ab, which amounts to (when using kamas) 7 attacks base (one-handed, not flurried, not hasted) IIRC.

ok, so I take 10 cot inside of 20, and go with the 10 rogue for the defensive roll, those both sound like they'll way improve this one.  No one sees any huge drawback to goin with the halfling then? And did my feat choices look sane to you guys?  I know without going with the two innitiative feats i could bump the dex two more, but with all those attacks, makes sense to get him swinging right?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Sidious Fell on 01/06/05 15:46</span></i></p>

Here is my suggestion for how you should level (not tested and from memory only so forgive any mistakes and feel free to correct) <br><br>1 Rogue weap finesse (this gives 16 more skill points than choosing monk first level)<br>2 Monk<br>3 Monk ambidextrous<br>4 Monk DEX=17<br>5 Monk <br>6 Monk two weap fighting<br>7 Rogue<br>8 Monk DEX =18<br>9 Monk Weapon Focus (kama)<br>10 Monk<br>11 COT<br>12 COT Dodge, IMP Crit (kama) DEX =19<br>13 COT <br>14 COT Imp 2 Weapon Fighting ( 4 levels of COT before level 10 will give you a bab of +16 which gives a main hand attack of +16/+13/+10/+7/+4/+1 for 6 attacks per round with 2 from offhand)<br>15 Rogue Mobility<br>16 Monk DEX=20<br>17 Rogue<br>18 Monk Improved Initiative<br>19 Monk<br>20 Monk DEX =21<br>21 COT Great DEX =22<br>22 COT Epic Weapon Focus <br>23 Monk<br>24 Monk DEX =23 Great DEX =24<br>25 Rogue <br>26 Rogue<br>27 Rogue Superior Initiative<br>28 Rogue DEX =25<br>29 Rogue<br>30 Rogue Improved Evasion (max UMD and other neccassary rogue skills, this could be taken later so you can have a higher level of UMD, but this way allows you to get epic dodge earlier)<br>31 COT<br>32 COT Toughness DEX =26<br>33 COT Epic Dodge<br>34 COT Epic Prowess<br>35 Monk<br>36 Monk Epic Toughness DEX=27<br>37 Monk<br>38 Monk<br>39 Monk Epic Toughness 2<br>40 Monk DEX =28<br><br>Ive left out spring attack , which is only useful if you are going to go for weapon master.
