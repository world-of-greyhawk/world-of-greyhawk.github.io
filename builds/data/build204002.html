<b>Playable from level 1 - 40  ..PvM</b><br><br>This build was inspired by a post I saw on another forum. I tweaked it somewhat but wanted to throw it out here for feedback. I built a dwarf version that focuses in Scimitar and Mace and came out with essentially the same stats.

Thanks for the great feedback. Me likes this build and expects to see him/her romping around my PW soon....<br><br>pulse cap,<br>That's not a typo where I discuss the Dwarf version choosing scimitar and mace - Cinnabar nailed my intention regarding the race choices. I opted for Scimitar and Mace for that build, but for the Human version, I opted to select Exotic weapons for three reasons: 1) To take advantage of the bonus Human feat, 2) To open up the choice of weaponry if a nice shiny toy is found laying around, and 3) My PW has some nice Katanas available pre-epic <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>Great point about taking mobility earlier - I'll incorporate that in my notes. Are both in the Fighter bonus feat list?<br><br>Regarding my choice of off-hand weaponry, I wanted something with a different damage type than the primary weapon, thus Mace (bludgeoning) to complement Katana (slashing). When my toddler is over his bug and I'm getting more sleep, I'll take a look at the calculations that you generously posted.<br><br>Again, thanks to you both for the feedback.<br><br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br><i>"Where there is life, there is hope." - Grover</i>

Great build.  I'm working on a very similar build as a replacement for my utterly-broken dex-based Twinblade from a couple of weeks ago.  I'm playing the char through HotU right now, which I understand is not the best test of a build.  However, under those circumstances, I'm finding that the rogue skills are pretty much wasted.  Saves, resistances, and immunities (from gear) mean that I take very little reflex damage anyway, which eliminates the usefulness of Evasion (and Search/Disable Trap, if you chose those).  I've yet to find a lock I couldn't bash using Power Attack (70+dmg crits), so Open Lock isn't helpful.  I had high hopes for UMD, but so far (CL 24) I've not found anything I really truly wanted to use that I couldn't normally use.  The character is so devastating with his melee weapons that I don't need to use scrolls or wands.  Tumble, obviously, is great for AC, but at least thus far I only very rarely need a healing potion to survive a fight or group of fights, which means the AC wouldn't do me a whole lot of good.  The extra 1d6 damage from sneak attack is good, certainly, but it's 1d6 on top of crits for 70 or so (with shortsword), so the extra 6 damage is not earth-shattering.<br><br>I'm not trying to slam the build... obviously I love it.  But I've been trying to justify the rogue levels to myself, and I hope you might know some additional factors that I've not yet thought of.  It may just be the difference between HotU and a PW... I've not yet tried any PWs.<br><br>So... why do you like the 2 rogue levels instead of, say, another 2 fighter levels (which would be more hp and 1 more feat)?<br><br>Thanks!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By SovranSpecific on 07/19/05 14:51</span></i></p>

It's quite simple, really.  Tumble.  +8 to AC.  Hard to pass it up.  Granted, Evasion is nice to have.  The only other alternative I could see would be to take Bard instead, to access both Tumble and Spellcraft.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 07/19/05 17:56</span></i></p>

My point was that in HotU, <i>without</i> tumble, this build already doesn't need healing very often at all, which means it's not using its full defensive capacity.  Adding more defensive capacity would mean it needs healing even less.  The real limiting factor in HotU (or the OC or SoU) is how big a single fight/encounter you can do before you have to heal; if you can survive the fight, you can rest or teleport back to town for healing.  If you're already surviving all the fights/encounters with plenty of hp left and without needing healing in the middle, adding more defensive abilities just reduces the number of hp that get healed when you rest or visit the temple or whatever.  If you were dying a lot, or using lots of heal potions, or finishing most of your fights with very few hp, then of course you'd want more defense.

Nice build griz.  just wondering why you take open lock as a skills, as opposed to something like set trap, search, disable trap or even something for roleplaying like intimidate, persuade or bluff.  with a massive melee build like this i don't think any door or chest is safe.<br>just curious is all.  otherwise, i like the crazy melee ability.  just wish you could have crammed in some magic or something else interesting to this build. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>"Perception is strong and sight weak.

If you took 2 Bard levels instead of the 2 Rogue levels, you could maximize Spellcraft instead of Open Lock and get an additonal +8 on spell saves.

This may be altering from your intentions too much, but dropping WM to 25 (lose 1 AB and bonus feat Epic Toughness), increasing Fighter to 12 (get WSpec and EWSpec for katana), and increasing Rogue to 3 (uncanny dodge and small sneak) seems like another possible option.<br><br>I prefer the +6 damage each hit with your primary hand.

Actually if you go with a DEX build instead of a STR build Take Rapier as your weapon or Kukri, you will have the same crit range but your AC will be higher ... make sure you take weapon finesse in there somewhere tho..
