Drop Mobility and Spring Attack (totally useless your tumble ranks will avoid you any AoO). Save boosters can get in, possibly a lvl 1 feat only with some rearranging of feats. If not going for Dev Crit, Great CLeave can be gone too to make room for Called Shot. Iron Will with your mind immunity is of little use, Lightning Reflexes seems a better choice. DEX to 14 and INT to 8 at least is a must. <br><br>Actually I would start with 17 STR and put 2 more points into INT then drop a Great STR for EP.

Any suggestions as to what to take in it's place? Also, I'm not entirely sure why you suggested to get rid of Great Cleave. Granted, in a PvP environement it will have little use, but it's one of the most useful feats available in PvM. Although, I could see myself taking called shot instead of spring attack.<br><br>As for Iron will, I mentioned it because "Perfect self" is known to be a bit buggy.

Some bugs about Monk mind immunity will be fixed in 1.68 patch. Actually they are already fixed as of now in 1.68 beta 2.<br><br>Great Cleave is really no big deal IMO cause it won't fire that often. Cleave is instead quite useful and more than enough for me (especially at lower levels) and anyhow it's a freebie for a monk. I bother with Great Cleave if and only going for Dev Crit (which btw I basically never do). <br><br>You should really think about at least lowering starting STR to 17 for an INT boost and no AB loss, if not even lowering DEX for a further INT boost and normal speech <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?

Half-Orc + monk + fighter = xp penalty<br><br>Halfers have barbarian as fav class.  You should notice the penalty if you are 19!

If you have Dex at 15, you could go with kamas and dual-wield. Drop MObility and Spring Attack, and you have 3 slots for Ambi/TWF/ITWF. Otherwise, drop Dex to 14 as others have suggested (circle kick isn't worth it).<br><br>To improve your saves, you could go Fighter 4/CoT 6. You need a WF in kama to qualify, but you have feats to spare. Taking even 1 CoT level pre-epic will gain you +2 to Reflex saves (strong in both Reflex and Fort), and you get another +3 to all saves from CoT levels. You get the same number of total feats.<br><br>TM

The penalty is because you are half-orc. Their favored class is Barbarian, and you aren't balancing Monk and Fighter levels. There would be no penalty as either a Dwarf (Fighter favored class) or Human (any class). Any other race will have an XP penalty with this combo of unbalanced fighter and monk levels. <br><br>You could avoid the penalty for the first 9 levels by alternating Monk and Fighter, but you will be stuck with it from level 10 on.<br><br>TM
