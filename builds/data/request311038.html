I know when you hips people have to retarget you in melee.  how does it effect spells?  If you see them start to glow/wave their arms etc and immediately hips does their spell fail if targeted?

If they still perceive you through spot or they have TS there will be no target loss. Listen is bugged though, so although the enemy is still perceived the target is lost and retargetting is needed.<br><br>Anyhow, if the target is lost the action queue is cleared up (which leaves you flatfooted btw) and the spell just does not fire (you stop casting and stand idle).<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

I often find that when people HIPS on me and im wailing on them i still follow them around and attack even though i can't see them. its probly more of a lucky glitch for me but it still happens quite often.
