<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>This is another old build that didn't get posted.  It was in competition with the Generalist.  In the end I weighed the damage reduction against the saves.  Since the Generalist could always use a scroll of premonition, he got posted.  Still I think this build deserves deserves to be seen.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-27 points of damage reduction.<br>-High hitpoints.<br>-High Use Magic Device.  He can't cast spells, but he can use any scroll.<br>-Devastating Critical.<br>-Evasion.  This gives him some magic defense.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br><br>-41 AB.  Low for a fighter, but okay for a Dwarven Defender.<br>-Lowish Saves. They were better than I expected but they're still pretty low.<br>-Low Charisma.  He has about as much charm as his name.<br>-Doesn't hit very hard.  He'd have trouble hitting an opponent with damage reduction.<br><br><i>Anvil</i><br><br>Level 1 Dwarf, LG, Fighter<br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 16<br>DEX 14<br>CON 16<br>WIS 10<br>INT 14<br>CHA 6<br>Feats: weapon focus (greatsword), luck of heroes<br><br>Level 2 Fighter 2<br>Feat: toughness<br><br>Level 3 Fighter 3<br>Feat: dodge<br><br>Level 4 Fighter 4<br>CON +1<br>Feat: weapon specialization (greatsword)<br><br>Level 6 Fighter 6<br>Feats: knockdown, blind fighting<br><br>Level 8 Fighter 8<br>CON +1<br>Feat: power attack<br><br>Level 9 Fighter 9<br>Feat: cleave<br><br>Level 10 Fighter 10<br>Feat: great cleave<br><br>Level 12 Fighter 10/Dwarven Defender 2<br>CON +1<br>Feat: improved critical (greatsword)<br><br>Level 15 Fighter 10/Dwarven Defender 5<br>Feat: improved knockdown<br><br>Level 16 Fighter 10/Dwarven Defender 6<br>CON +1<br><br>Level 18 Fighter 10/Dwarven Defender 8<br>Feat: lightning reflexes<br><br>Level 20 Fighter 10/Dwarven Defender 10<br>CON +1<br><br>Level 21 Fighter 10/Dwarven Defender 11<br>Feat: great strength I<br><br>Level 24 Fighter 10/Dwarven Defender 14<br>STR +1<br>Feats: great strength II, epic weapon focus (greatsword)<br><br>Level 27 Fighter 10/Dwarven Defender 17<br>Feat: great strength III<br><br>Level 28 Fighter 10/Dwarven Defender 18<br>STR +1<br>Feat: damage reduction I<br><br>Level 30 Fighter 10/Dwarven Defender 20<br>Feat: great strength IV<br><br>Level 32 Fighter 10/Dwarven Defender 22<br>STR +1<br>Feat: damage reduction II<br><br>Level 33 Fighter 10/Dwarven Defender 23<br>Feat: great strength V<br><br>Level 36 Fighter 10/Dwarven Defender 26<br>STR +1<br>Feats: overwhelming critical (greatsword), damage reduction III<br><br>Level 39 Fighter 11/Dwarven Defender 26/Rogue 2<br>Feat: devastating critical (greatsword)<br><br>Level 40 Fighter 12/Dwarven Defender 26/Rogue 2<br>STR +1<br>Feat: epic weapon specialization (greatsword)<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 26<br>DEX 14<br>CON 21<br>WIS 10<br>INT 14<br>cHA 6<br><br><i>Hit Points</i> 684<br><br><i>Final Saves</i><br>Fortitude 30<br>Reflexes 21<br>Will 20<br><br><i>AB and Damage</i> <br><br>(normal greatsword no buffs)<br>41/36/31/26 18+2D6 (17-20 x2)<br>Devastating Critical DC 38<br><br>(+12 strength, +5 keen greatsword, true strike)<br>67/62/57/52 32+2D6 (15-20 x2) <br>Devastating Critical DC 44<br><br><i>AC</i> (with no items) 20<br><i>DR</i> 27<br><br><i>172 Skill Points, Suggested Use</i><br><br>Concentration 7<br>Discipline 43<br>Spell Craft 20<br>Tumble 40<br>Use Magic Device 42<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 19:57</span></i></p>
