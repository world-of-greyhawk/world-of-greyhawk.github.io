Nice, first of its kind according to the search engine, this class mix!<br><br>What's the story behind 31 STR? Change the last GSTR to ESF: Taunt, that's always a good feat to have (if not, a saving throw booster wouldn't hurt either)! Or GCHA to get an even Charisma score (as you said), though I don't find that too important... Nay, I'd pick the ESF. Other than that, I have no complaints whatsoever.<br><br>I like overall. I'd hardly call your AB weaker than average. AC isn't too great, but not the worst either. One could change the WoC to a one-hander too, and use a shield (like you said... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <b></b>)<br><br>You forgot a few things. HP: 460 and SP: 166 (quickly calculated).

Depending on what world you play on, Summons might have their spell duration cut.  When it comes to a 1st level Summon Creature spell, I think I preffer the Shelgarn's Persistant Blade better.  You can Flame + Keen it.

Thanks for the catch on the HP and skills; I must have went over it 3 or 4 times trying to see if I missed anything before posting...must be old age <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Yes, the lack of skill points is frustrating.  With cross-classing Tumble and keeping Discipline up, Taunt doesn't catch up till mid-epic. I also wanted to put points in Intimidate and/or Persuade, but I guess you can't have everything.  (or much of anything in this build  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  )<br><br>About the 31 Strength... I went back and forth on that one for quite a while trying to decide which way would be best to end it.   My thinking was this:  There is a 50% chance that my Bull's strength will come up odd. eg, If rolled a 5, then I would have a Strength of 36.  Of course, I could just as easily roll a 4 and end up with a Strength of 35. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   In the end, I figured I'd just leave it odd for times that I rolled an odd Bulls Strength.  <br><br>After letting it mull around in my brain for a while, I think that it might be best to put Strength at 30 and Charisma at 16 as this will net you another 3rd level spell casting.  But your other suggestions would be good as well, depending on style of play and available items.<br><br>Thanks for the input.

30 and 16 is the way to go.  Your extra CHA will also benefit your BG abilities too.  It's easy enought to max out your STR buffs with Items and Spells.  That one STR point will not aid you as much as the extra CHA point would.

Also with stackable Bulls', the point is moot. You'll be casting two, and thus, should you get 2 * 5 = 10 you'd want to have an even base score <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm
