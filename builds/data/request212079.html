Use Rogue10/Assassin14/BG16, it will net you an epic BG feat. Use rogue 8/Assin4/BG8 pre-epic. But you could possibly do better with fewer rogue levels, or more. I don't think it is to smart to balance Assassin and rogue. Bomb one of them.

Hi,and hanks for helping.<br>About the henchmen: At now i always go with a henchmen and every time I played a stealthy Character the henchmen charges to the Enemy. The only way i´ve seen was say at the henchmen to hold the position, sneak the enemy and when the Enemy faced mi en combat, order the henchmen to fight. Meanwhile the enemy killd me.<br><br>This time I will try it alone,without a henchmen, knowing that it was more risky.<br><br>I want rise Dex because most of the rouge abilitys have a base of Dex (tumble,open lock,disarm trap, etc.) and i want fighting with 2 kukri, so that for the feats is need 15 Dex and 14 STR as prerequisit.<br>_________________<br>Something is out there in the Dark....

What feat existing needs 14 STR? You need 13 STR or monk lvl's to qualify for Cleave, to qualify for Blackie. Phew. A halfling or elf is the most logical choice, for the dex bonus. An elf will yield 4 higher DC for resisting your knockdowns, while a Halfling will get you 1 better AC and AB. So in truth, Elf will give you 3 higher DC on Knockdown. Take 5 rogue levels, then 4 assassin, then you should qualify for BG. Take 10 BG, and at lvl 20, take your last Rogue level. Keep the rest of your levels as Assassin or Blackie. Raise Dex on every chance, keep UMD and trap skills to deal wih crit immune. UMD is also good for having access to more items to use. You really need a decent INT in this build, at least 14.<br><br>See one of Grizzled Dwarflord's Assassin builds in the builders forum to see why you could go STR with such a build. That would make it even more versatile.<br><br>Your build in this case should end up something like Rog6/Asn18/BG16. Thats the best lvl split I can see, to maximise your number of feats. Though it will still only yield you 4 bonus epic feats. You will have 17d6 sneak/Death attack and your Death attack DC will be around 30.<br><br>Hope this was at least a little bit helpful.

Ooops,sorry. My fault. I misunderstood the Desciption of Ambidextrism (called it so en english? I´ve the spanish version).

Two kukri's gives you great coolness factor, and with a perma-Haste item, or Haste at least, and the build above you should get 7 attacks/round. That is three in the first flurry which WILL generate sneaks. If you need more AC for some reason, switch to kukri+shield for that fight.<br><br>I enjoy two-weapon-fighting, and kukri's are tiny, so they are usable to max efficiency for Halfling's to.

That was what I thing,too. And because there are tiny weapons there is only a -2 penalty for the off-hand.<br><br>Fine, so long, so good.

The dodge feat can be used, for 1 AC vs 1 opponent, but forget about mobilty and spring attack. You will keep Tumble maxed, and once it hits a modified 15 (which it will fast) they are superfluos. Since by that time you won't be receiveng attacks of opportyunity anymore. Starting stas seem good. Looking forward to seeing your build. Remember, if you go for Blackguard, you will need to raise STR to 13 for Power attack and Cleave.<br><br>edit: Perhaps starting with 14 INT and STR 13 and DEX 19. Redistributing some of your skills.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 09/15/05 10:20</span></i></p>

The first build I tried was a Blackguard/Rogue/SD which seems somewhat similar to what you're trying for with all the stacked sneaks. I really DON'T recommend blackguard for a rogue type. Rogues don't get many bonus feats which you can take for stuff like KD, Armor Skin, etc and Blackguard does NOT help much with that at all. If only they'd put in a CoT-like class for evil PCs. You'll probably really really struggle to get all the feats you'd like when you'd like (especially if you plan on getting Power Attack/Cleave for Blackguard levels pre-epic and Exotic AND dual wielding) with that class combo as an elf. I mean you'll make it but it'll be during the post-epic levels. If you're going assassin-heavy, you might have trouble getting epic dodge.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Jennalee on 09/15/05 14:32</span></i></p>
