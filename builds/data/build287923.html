I started thinking about this build a few weeks ago, but then dropped the idea because I didn't think it would be effective enough. However, I finally got to trying it out, and in a party is turned out to be quite useful.

Skill Focus: Perform doesn't seem to do this build much good unless it is a requirement I'm not aware of. It gets 2 hp and 1 skill point with a minimal buff, but another feat might serve you better. Perhaps weapon focus:sling or toughness. weapon focus:sling would get you once less ab for the sling than your melee weapon.

I try to get the full benefits from Bard Song, and Skill Focus: Perform gets Peform to 49 ranks, just one point from the level 20 Bard Song. Because the focus of the build is aiding its party, it seemed appropiate.<br>However, on my first try I had taken Toughness, due to the low hitpoints.<br><br>For solo play, I would take Toughness all the way and rely on CHA and Perform enhancing gear. Should have noted it in the OP.

Drop con to 12 raise cha to 16,saves u 1gr dex so take esf perform and toughness instead of sf perform.or drop int or str by 2. U could swap out dodge as its only 1ac vs current attacker.

I would definitely drop Discipline - your AC will almost certainly be high enough that anything that hits you will overcome your discipline anyway. Taunt sounds good, and with the other 22 points you have sitting around I would pump Search and Disable Traps. You should be able to get both Set and Disable Traps to 16 (so you can handle all Deadly traps), and even a few points in search will let you find most of them (I think you only need a 22 or so to find them, so even 10 points will find them pretty quickly, if not on the first roll....).<br><br>TM

Yeah, dropping Discipline is a possibility. With the penalty for small stature and only 43 ranks, any serious knockdowner (¿?) will get you every time. In fact, without a nice STR score and ESF, Discipline is a waste. At any rate, you should avoid these guys, and that's why you have lots of posibilites: HiPS, Epic Dodge, Invisibility, UMD.<br>However, 43 is enough to stop those who don't have the AB to make Knockdown too dangerous, in my opinion.<br><br>Disable Traps will make him even more party-friendly, so that's a good suggestion<br><br>Ok, revised version coming...<br>01: Rogue(1): Dodge<br>02: Rogue(2): {Evasion}<br>03: Bard(1): Weapon Finesse<br>04: Bard(2): DEX+1, (DEX=17)<br>05: Bard(3)<br>06: Bard(4): Toughness<br>07: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>08: Rogue(4): DEX+1, (DEX=18)<br>09: Bard(5): Blind Fight<br>10: Bard(6)<br>11: Bard(7)<br>12: Rogue(5): DEX+1, Weapon Focus, (DEX=19)<br>13: Rogue(6)<br>14: Bard(8)<br>15: Bard(9): Curse Song<br>16: Bard(10): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>17: Rogue(7)<br>18: Rogue(8): Mobility<br>19: Bard(11)<br>20: Bard(12): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br>21: Shadowdancer(1): Great Dexterity I, {Hide in Plain Sight}, (DEX=22)<br>22: Rogue(9)<br>23: Rogue(10): Defensive Roll<br>24: Rogue(11): DEX+1, Great Dexterity II, (DEX=24)<br>25: Rogue(12)<br>26: Rogue(13): Improved Evasion<br>27: Bard(13): Epic Skill Focus: Perform<br>28: Bard(14): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br>29: Bard(15)<br>30: Bard(16): Epic Dodge<br>31: Bard(17)<br>32: Bard(18): DEX+1, (DEX=26)<br>33: Bard(19): Epic Weapon Focus<br>34: Bard(20)<br>35: Bard(21)<br>36: Bard(22): DEX+1, Lasting Inspiration, (DEX=27)<br>37: Bard(23): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=28)<br>38: Bard(24)<br>39: Bard(25): Epic Prowess<br>40: Bard(26): DEX+1, Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=30)<br><br>Disable Trap 12(16), Hide 43(53), Move Silently 43(55), Perform 43(56), Search 9(11), Set Trap 5(17), Spellcraft 43(45), Taunt 43(46), Tumble 40(50), UMD 42(45)<br><br>This version has more Perform, swapped Discipline for Taunt and added some Disable Traps and Search.
