This sorcerer in life was so powerhungry and narcisitic that he attmpted to avoid death, and in doing so became a powerful lich.

K then, just some feedback on this. Have to say I like the build a lot.<br><br>Personally I would be inclined to drop your starting CHA to 16 - giving you 6 more stat points at startup. You could then put 1 into STR to get your modifier to +2, the same with CON, freeing up a CON taken at a later level for another CHA. then either 4 into Dex or 2 into DEX and 2 into INT. <br><br>Going the second route would give you access to both Expertise and Imp Expertise, which would benefit your tactics greatly with a further 10 points to your ac. <br>Don't forget that your Reflex save improves in line with your Dex modifier also.<br><br>With a maxed Concentration you may find that Improved Combat Casting is not all that necessary, particularly if hasted.<br><br>HPs.... I only manage 450 unbuffed on this level split. <br><br>Spell Penetration Feats.. do you really need three? as it stands you achieve a 34 +1d20 every time. I'd drop Epic Spell Pen for something else, which would get you over the toolset's base of 32 limit.<br><br>Take your Hide ranks during PM levels as these are class skills.<br><br>Skill Focus: Discipline - perhaps Still Spell instead then you benefit from Full Plate and Shield.<br><br>Maximize over Empower Spell? and no Extend Spell?<br><br>I would seriously considering Auto Still Spells as well and maybe dropping Hellball and both Great Cons - to achieve this.<br><br>2 x Great Con = 40 HP and 1 point to Fort save... is this truly worth it?<br><br>Blackguard is a wonderful class, but the requirements are high for such a feat starved build, ie Power Attack and Cleave. Bearing in mind this is not a meleer, they seem a waste.<br><br>Bard may suit a whole lot better due to the CHA related abilities, but you may finding taking 2 more Sorc Levels to be more beneficial, which would let you drop Greater Spell Penetration as well, whilst still maintaining 32 +1d20 each cast.<br><br>Finally Tumble - crossclassing gives you a further 4 points to AC, 8 if you took Bard (which gives Discipline also).<br><br>Armor Class with a 12 in Dex, 4 in Tumble, 6 PM, 20 Epic Mage Armor, 8 Full Plate and 3 Tower and 4 Haste gives you 57 AC, before any items, which is quite respectable in itself.<br><br>Anyway just some thoughts for you.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 12/26/05 09:18</span></i></p>

So 28+1d20 vs 51 stands that you need to roll a 23... not possible even if you take Spell Pen and greater you still land a 30 + 1d20 which is 1 off a lvl 40 monk or Drow. Also some places the Spell resistacne given by the cleric can also increase with levels or spell foci which can attain a 52 at times.

Well I leveld it how it was Just for writings purposes, mainly cause I didn't want to think of it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>In reality I'd take BlackGuard at lvl 22 ish then later at 39 I mean really you can move any level anywhere pretty simply as long as you keep certain levels with certain feats liek you can't take EPic spells on BG or PM but you can take it earlier or later if you like. Also you can't get EDR till like 30 or something so not that bad. <br><br>I put 1-20 Sorc mainly cause it's easier to level a 20 sorc then a 15 sorc 4 PM 1 BG or something. <br><br>But yeah move the levels wherever you like really.<br><br>Erm I took Hellball cause I couldn't think of anything else <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>~I am the wisest man on earth because I know one thing, and that is I know nothing.~<br>-Cairne
