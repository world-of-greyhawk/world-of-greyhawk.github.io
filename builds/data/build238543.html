You have a rather low Dex for an AA, and no Uncanny Dodge or Epic Dodge.<br><br>Given that, I would make him a Zen archer, and go wis-based. Drop Dex to 14, raise Str to 14, pump Wis to 17 to start, drop Weapon Finesse and take Zen Archery, and put all points into Wis. You can also drop the Improved SF feats for more Great Wis, your wis will be high enough to still give you an excellent SF DC.<br><br>Also drop the WF Unarmed for Called Shot. Use that to pile in a bunch of Called Shot: leg, and they will both take longer to get to you, and when they do get there their dex will lowered, making them easier to hit with your stunning fist (which will have a lower AB, but a 3 Dex will make up for some of that).<br><br>I would also be tempted to drop a few Monk levels (say down to 9 or even 6), spread them out more for skill dumps, and take a few more AA and/or wizard levels.<br><br>TM

Well, it's interesting, if you can stun your enemies then it should work pretty well for an archer.<br><br>Well, I don't think getting level 3 spells it's so important, although maybe you want more slots for level 2, however, I think you should either drop Wizard levels for AA, or drop Monk levels for Wizard, and get level 4 spells for Improved Invisibility.....<br><br>I think he took 14 Monk levels for the SR (and more stuning fists), but I wouldn't recommend it, as it is low and it can't be increased, lower Monk to 9 to keep Improved Evasion, but that's quite it, too low would make you have very little stunning fists, but with 9 levels it should go fine, if after using 9 stunning fists you haven't killed your enemy, you're probably toasted.

You gain +6 to your ranged AB, and lose 5 from your unarmed AB. You can get back the 5 from Called Shots (on a str-based enemy with only +1 dex, you can get more against a dex-based enemy). With your monk speed bonus, you should be faster than most enemies anyway, I'd rather focus on the ranged attack and damage over unarmed in that build.<br><br>Also, Wis AC is not lost if you get caught flat-footed. Relying on dex AC with no uncanny dodge is risky - if even 1 sneaky type catches you unaware you will be in deep trouble. Wis also adds to your listen and spot checks, so you can max one of those and have a good chance of detecting sneakers before they get to you.  <br><br><br>TM

Prerequisites are 19 DEX, 19 WIS, Improved Unarmed Strike and Stunning Fist IIRC, Monk is used to gain the stuff easier and unarmed cheesiness.<br><br>It is a general feat and all, I meant Bonus Class Feats, for which a class can only choose those which are in his class list, I think only Monk and CoT have ISF as bonus class feats.
