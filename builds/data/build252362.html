I love all things cleric... though this one is hard to love ;P !!  jk<br><br>I have always loved the IDEA of a cleric/paladin.  Mixing dd with it is a very nice idea.  The thing is, your ENTIRE epic career is in xp penalty.  Using a dwarf for a pal/cleric makes it a really hard choice, cuz of the cha penalty and non-favord class...  You could "fix" it by taking pal/cler lvls as you go, which would stunt the ab alittle, but with a build like this, the only reason to take cleric are for the buffs.  You NEED ext spell feat.  It is a must have here.  In order to take it, I, personally, would omit exotic and focus in battleaxe (use the craft skill to make it look like a dwarfaxe!!).  You gain a feat and sacrifice ONLY d2 of damage.   <br><br>I realy hate to see you stop at 11 cleric.. it seems a waste to go so far and come up short.  Maybe you could give your reasoning for 11 cleric.  <br><br>Also, somethin to tink about is the div exploit.  By takin 16+ bab pre you doom yourself to the mediocre 4apr vs usin div pwr to gain a 4th attack at full ab!  If you take str domain and ext spell you can BUFF all day and gain so much from this guy.  <br><br>In short, I would love to see this guy gain at least one more cleric lv and ext spell, and if you really could, get 15 cleric (esp since you take blind at lv 39!!  you could cut dd to 10 to loose 3/- and blind, or you could take blind instead of armor skin, a fair trade imho.  <br><br>Good first try <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 09/09/06 15:58</span></i></p>

Right... Phew. Thanks for the reply, first off. Now, down to those points you made. Glad to see you like the cleric/paladin combo, great RP value I always think. Dropping DWA for battelaxe to get extend spell, absolutely. Spell duration on his low cleric lvls is awful.<br><br>Speaking of which, it IS a real shame he has so few cleric lvls, i like taking 15 usually. Decided I couldn't cut down on paladin without losing Holy Sword (or axe in this case). Wanted the bonus DwD feat/DR bonus, but I spose cleric did suffer for that a little too much. 10 lvls DwD it is.<br><br>About the divine exploit. Fair point... I suppose that is quite important, although I have seen servers which disable the extra APR from it, or disable it altogether. So I have a little trick to help.I'll do alternating Paladin/Cleric lvls like you suggested to eliminate as much of the xp penalty (really horrible right now) as possible. Not exactly an expert, but I think that this could mean enough pre-epic BAB decrease, leading to maximum exploitation <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  .<br><br>Lastly, the blindfight things has irked me a bit. I will ditch AS for it.<br><br>I'll be tweaking it as necessary for optimum performance, so thanks for the suggestions!<br><br>Kurth<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By K U R T H on 09/09/06 16:29</span></i></p>

Right. Had a look, tweaked a bit. And it's harder than I thought <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> . Loses a chunk of ab, no xp penalty, but can't really get the full spellset without having an abyssmal strength, or dropping EDR.<br><br>Either way, I suppose changing DWA for battleaxe and getting extend spell is the best way of doing things without completely changing the build.<br><br>Of course, if there's something I'm missing out on, do please tell me.<br><br>Kurth

Wow. I suppose this IS a bit of a bum start by me. But I've tested (twice) the c/p/c/p etc lvling and he ends up with 17 BAB at lvl 20 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">

You're correct. The only way to get 15 BAB by level 20 is to go 17 CLC/3 Pally, 18 CLC/2 Pally, 19 CLC/1 Pally, or 20 CLC. Any other combination of CLC and Pally will result in 16 BAB or more.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

LOL my bad!   17 gives 4 apr, which isnt shabby!  Your ab suffers cuz you lack strength, was all I was meanin to say (never try to do math when distracted...  yes 10 cleric would give you 7bab +10 from ftr..  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">  )

Right... Now I'm getting somewhere. Big weaknesses in this one. Low strength, few feats, etc... But I think I've got a way of salvaging it.<br><br>Maybe going to go for Cleric/CoT/DwD instead, more feats, no xp penalty. Miss out on the holy axe, but still keeps the whole holy warrior concept.<br><br>Did a quick test of it to see if i could get the required horrid pre-epic BAB for divine exploit, before I read your reply Cinn (Thanks for that by the way). It's looking good, seeing as I can't exploit it without dropping more CoT/DwD levels, I'm going to go for all-out pre-epic BAB anyway. Post the new one shortly.<br><br>Ooh, and by the way, this guy won't be using the same splits as Avatar of the Dwarven Lord by Samphus or Grimnir's Dwarven Warpriest.
