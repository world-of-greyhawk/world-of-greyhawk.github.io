I have a Shadow Archer and was just looking at her stats in the Character sheet in-game.<br><br>Without Rapid shot, she has:<br><br>47/42/37/32<br><br>With Rapid shot activated and a longbow equiped, it says<br><br>45/40/35/30<br><br>Shouldn't I be seeing a 5th attack listed here?

Yes, all of those feats work, but the extra attacks don't show up on your character sheet.<br><br>Steve

Thanks.<br><br>I also noticed that when I put on armor, my dex mod drops from 11 to 4. However, my BAB for a bow does not change when I add/remove the armor.<br><br><br>Is this another effect not shown on the character sheet but "in effect" in-game?

Firstly the only thing affected by your dex mod dropping is your AC.<br><br>Secondly if you have a dex mod of +11 then you have a dex of 32, at which point you shouldnt be wearing armor (if you have similar bracer of armor available to your armor AC +)<br><br>Base 10<br>DEX bonus +11<br>Bracer +5 = 26 AC<br><br>or Base 10<br>Armor AC 5<br>DEX bonus +4<br>magic +5= 24 AC totla.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

The different armors have different maximum dexterity bonus to AC. <br>A full plate has AC8, but only allows +1 AC bonus from dex. A padded armor only has AC1, but allows +8 AC bonus from dex.<br>No armor/plain clothing¨and mage/monk robes have no limit to dexterity bonus to AC. <br><br>Like Syrath said, in your case no armor(11 AC)will be better than any armor (7 - 9AC incl dex bonus).<br><br>Another reason not to wear armor or shield is that any armor heavier than leather, and all shields, give a penalty to some of the dex based skills like tumble, hide and move silently. Heavy armor is worse than light, big shields are worse than the small ones.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

I understand the maximum armor thing. <br><br>What I was curious about was AB. How come no drop in my AB with a bow.  <br><br><br>So to rephrase the question: if armor restricts your DEX bonus, what specifically is affected. <br><br>From what I gather:<br><br>AC is affected<br>Skill point bonuses are affected.<br><br><br>DEX based attack bonuses are NOT affected.<br><br>Is this true? If so, anything else?<br><br><br>Disclaimer: I'm not intending to wear DEX restricting armor. I'm just curious about effects as I noticed a strange one.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Banshe on 04/22/05 14:27</span></i></p>

So for example a tower shield has a penalty of -10 on certain dex based abilities (for example tumble, hide ,sneak etc.) Plate has a similar effect . So a rogue wearing plate and using a tower shield has a very heavy penalty to hiding but still has his full dex modifer.<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>DEX based attack bonuses are NOT affected.<br><br>Is this true?

This means that the maximum AC gained from wearing it is 7(if you have at least +4 dex modifer). It incurrs no skill penalty. Wear chain and you get one more AC but incurr a skill penalty.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!
