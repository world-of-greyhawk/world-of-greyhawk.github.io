A pretty obvious build, but it’s very effective and I thought it would be helpful to others to have on record.<br><br><b>Playable 1-40</b> (Though it can be a pain without help / good gear.)<br>Performs best in <b>PvP</b>.<br><br><b>Advantages:</b><br>High AB (61 with a +5 Rapier and +12 DEX)<br>Relatively high AC (66 with +5 gear and +12 DEX. 70 with Shadow Evade, 74 With Haste)<br>Epic Dodge (Heck yes.)<br>Pretty decent damage output. (You’ve got over 7 levels of Weapon Master, Epic Weapon Specialization, and a rapier!)<br>You can go toe to toe with the best of them.<br><br><b>Disadvantages:</b><br>Poor saves.<br>Lowish HP.<br>You rely on critical hits, mostly. Undead and other things immune to critical hits will be a pain to kill.<br>Poor detection capabilities.<br><br>Race: <b>Elf</b><br>Alignment: Any (Go with a neutral.)<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>STR 10<br>DEX 20(34) - <b>All points to DEX</b><br>CON 12<br>INT 14 <br>WIS 8<br>CHA 8<br><br>Level 1 - Fighter 1: Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus: Rapier, Discipline 4 Ranks<br>Level 2 - Fighter 2: Expertise<br>Level 3 – Fighter 3: Dodge<br>Level 4 – Fighter 4: Mobility<br>Level 5 – Fighter 5:<br>Level 6 – Fighter 6: Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack, Intimidate 4 Ranks<br>Level 7 – Weapon Master 1: Weapon of Choice: Rapier<br>Level 8 – Weapon Master 2:<br>Level 9 – Weapon Master 3: Improved Critical (Rapier)<br>Level 10 – Weapon Master 4:<br>Level 11 – Weapon Master 5:<br>Level 12 – Weapon Master 6: Toughness<b>*</b> (Max HP is 23 for this level.)<br>Level 13 – Weapon Master 7:<br>Level 14 – Weapon Master 8:<br>Level 15 – Weapon Master 9: Blindfight<b>*</b><br>Level 16 – Weapon Master 10:<br>Level 17 – Fighter 7:<br>Level 18 – Fighter 8: Weapon Specialization (Rapier), Knockdown<b>*</b><br>Level 19 – Fighter 9:<br>Level 20 – Fighter 10: Improved Knockdown<b>*</b><br>Level 21 – Weapon Master 11: Great Dexterity I, Hide 10, Move Silently 8, Tumble 5<br>Level 22 – Shadow Dancer 1: <br>Level 23 – Weapon Master 12:<br>Level 24 – Weapon Master 13: Great Dexterity II, Epic Weapon Focus (Rapier)<br>Level 25 – Weapon Master 14:<br>Level 26 – Weapon Master 15:<br>Level 27 – Shadow Dancer 2: Great Dexterity III<br>Level 28 – Weapon Master 16: Armor Skin<br>Level 29 – Shadow Dancer 3: <br>Level 30 – Shadow Dancer 4: Great Dexterity IV<br>Level 31 – Weapon Master 17:<br>Level 32 – Shadow Dancer 5:<br>Level 33 – Fighter 11: Epic Weapon Specialization (Rapier)<br>Level 34 – Shadow Dancer 6:<br>Level 35 – Shadow Dancer 7:<br>Level 36 – Weapon Master 18: Epic Fortitude<b>**</b><br>Level 37 – Shadow Dancer 8:<br>Level 38 – Shadow Dancer 9:<br>Level 39 – Shadow Dancer 10: Epic Dodge, Tumble 40<br>Level 40 – Weapon Master 19: Epic Prowess, Discipline 43, Spot 43<br><br><b>*</b>: Feat can be replaced with Great Fortitude, Improved Expertise, Knockdown, Improved Knockdown, Toughness, Blindfight. (I chose what is listed because Improved Expertise will most likely not be needed with your AC and Epic Dodge, and the extra 40 HP is nice. Another good option would be to drop Improved Knockdown for Great Fortitude.)<br><b>**</b>: Feat can be replaced with Epic Skill Focus: Discipline (If you don’t need the fortitude for protection against devastating critical hit, but it’s pretty handy.)<br><br>Skills: Discipline 43(43), Spot 43(44), Tumble 40(52), Hide 10(22), Move Silently 8(20), Intimidate 4(3)<br>37 Left over to put wherever. You could even them out into Hide and Move Silently for some minor stealth – You do have HIPS, or drop them into Concentration on your fighter level for some resistance against taunt.<br><br>Naked Fort: 25<br>Naked Ref: 32<br>Naked Will: 15<br><br>Max Naked HP: 440<br>Naked AC – 32 (35 with a tower shield.)<br>Naked Unarmed AB – 43<br>Mundane Rapier AB – 50<br>Mundane Rapier Damage – 1d6 + 6 13-20/x3<br>AB with a +5 Rapier and +12 DEX – <b>61</b><br>Damage with +5 Keen Rapier and +12 STR – 1d6 + 17 10-20/x3<br>AC with +5 Armor, Boots, Deflection, Natural, Tower Shield, +12 DEX – <b>66</b> (Shadow Evade will bring it to 70 and give you 20% conceal for 5 rounds, if you’d like. Another 4 from Haste is also delicious.)<br><br>Similar Builds:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "143606", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Shadow Avenger by kreestopearq</a><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "143461", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The not so dashing swashbuckler by syrath1001</a><br><br>Both of these builds go for Self Conceal V. However, I don't find it necessary when you have a high AC and epic dodge, and the AB helps you out a lot more. Not to mention there are other ways you can find 50% concealment.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 05/27/10 20:43</span></i></p>

I tend not to read alot of the top stuff, as i just get to the build.  If the build catches me, i go back and read the rest.  I must say, i was thinking to myself that this was very nice, but was missing one thing, then i went through it again and, nope, i was wrong!  Lv 33 EWS!  You some how sneakeded it in on me from my first to second reading!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   Nicely done man.<br><br>And to top it off, you didnt mention the most obvious point of it all, except for a passing remarkL HIPS!  <br><br>Nicely done.

Compare to a fighter11/WM16/Rogue13.  Do you really think this works better?<br><br>Damage is seriously not impressive, especially for a WM.  There are no alternate sources of damage.  You effectively have a rapier, w/ EWS, and the expanded crits.  Very good AB, but still, offensively, weak.<br><br>You invest an awful lot into defense.  You're DEX based, and using ten levels of a class, w/ little besides gaining the pre-reqs you need for ED.  All that for a pretty good AC, and Epic Dodge.<br><br>Why elven?  You could do much better.<br><br>If I'm missing something crucial, please enlighten me, but from what I see, this combination just aint doin' much for ya.<br><br>For what it's worth though, given the parameters (DEX based WM/SD w/ ED), it's a tight build.  I don't think I can improve on it, but I do think it should probably be demolished and built again from the ground up.  Seriously.  F11/WM16/R13.<br><br>Also, why do you say "poor detection capabilities?"  Maxed Spot and Keen Senses seems pretty decent to me.  Sure, no Search, but seems to be at least decent detection capabilities.  Sellin' yourself short there.

I would prolly drop Dex by 2, raise str to 14, raise Con to 15, swap out a feat in epic for a great con, which should have you at about 500 hp.<br><br>Definitely blind fight, and i would prolly go called shot and KD for the spare feats. I wouldnt bother with fort feats .. you suck at it anyway, so avoid dev critters. You win some, you lose some.<br><br>14 Str opens up Power attack to up the dmg vs crit immun mobs<br><br>The caveat to my comments being: I prefer non min-max and mostly non pvp<br><br>I do prefer this build over rogue variant, I like elves, i like SD. Im too lazy to corner sneak.<br><br>Peace out.<br>_________________<br>Workings of a Chaotic-Neutral mind:<br><br>Mind to Subconscious: Sir!
