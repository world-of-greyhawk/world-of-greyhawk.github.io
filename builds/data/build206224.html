<i>Challenge to play until the 30s, Gets really good after level 30</i><br><b>PvM build</b><br><br>Well, i posted this build some time ago and apparently it didn't generate much excitment.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_sleep2.gif">        So, I made a few changes to make it more playable 1-40.  Still a challenge until the 30s, but after that, he's a hard hitting, high AC, Damage Reduction machine.  Tested in epic halls of training mod and seems to play well.  AC up into the 60s, AB into 40s, with DR and evasion.  Anyway, hope you enjoy.

Just a few things of note.<br>First, there is a build using the same classes on the epic character build page.  The Dragon Savant I believe.  Not only does he get a higher AC but also he can change into a dragon.<br>Also you take many levels of druid, pre-epic, without gaining any benefit from the higher spells since you do not increase wisdom.  Perhaps switching this with the Con increases to gain some more pre-epic umpf.  You would get the EDR later, but probably worth it.<br>Why do you take Disarm.  Without changing into a more powerful melee creature like a dragon, or some of the shifter shapes, you lose alot of the benefit.  Without a good Strength modifier, or even finessing a decent dex score, you will not be able to hit many opponents, forget about disarming them.  I would also recommend dropping one point from dex into int would net you another 40 skillpoints, and since dex is not important, probably a worthy sacrifice. but you would lose access to dodge, and thus DwD, so maybe take it away from something else?<br>Why not take Zen Archery?  You have high wisdom, which would at least allow you some better combat presence.<br>While on the subject of stats, ending wisdom and con on uneven numbers gets little additional benefit.  I would take one spent attribute point from one into the other.  maybe into con for better hp, but wis for stronger spells and AC is good too.<br>Why not take monk a little later, to take better advantage of the boost from tumble.   Also, you can boost discipline.  You don't seem to have an concentration, which for a spellcaster is a pretty bad idea...you can also max that with monk as a later, if not final, level.  Also a low spellcraft score is so-so, since you gain a higher resistance to spells with a better score (39 with your current intelligence, 38 if you take my idea).  If need be I would drop the points from animal empathy, since there are few animals which can stand up to a good fight, and most PW are lacking animals to pick up.<br>Also, using a higher amount of monk (just 4 more) you can pick up KD and Impr KD for free.  Not a bad idea either.<br>A nice try on the build, but I think that there might be a better way to go about your goals.  speaking of which, what was the goal for this build?  certain levels or stats?  With a better idea of where you want the build to be when finished, the better ideas others can come up with for the build.<br><br>blah, my brain is fried.  hope that helps, or if not, than sorry...going back into the cave to stare at a wall. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-C<br>_________________<br>Do not meddle in the affairs of Dragons, for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.

A little tip of mine here. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     Use Druid 20/DD 14/Monk 6.<br>That will give you 3 more DR, IKD free and 1 ac, plus a little speed. No loss in spell either, just duration with buffs. And 20 is good enough. And start with 14 wis, and put the other two points in dex and wis. Gives you one more ac and 43 skill points at NO COST!!!! If you dont really want those monk levs, switch two of your Druid levs to DD only. 12 Druid and 8 DD pre epic will give the best BAB. Concentration is a must. Noone can break that with your DR. Soaking up damage while dishing out spells. And like he said, drop Animal Emp and heal, get your base tumble to 40 and throw the rest to concentration. Perhaps a little focus in a wep or more wis, for even better ac. I kinda like the build, with many Druid levs and DR. Your spells and DR makes it a godd PvM build, but not to good PvP i would believe. Not tested it tho. A nice thing with having 24 Druid tho (going24/14/2), is that Owls insight will give you +12 to wis. A nifty bonus. Your naked ac would be, with my suggests and Owls insight+barkskin.<br>10+ 8(tumble)+ 2(dex)+ 13(24/36WIS)+ 5(Barkskin)= 38. Not to bad, eh. Dont wear armor. You can use monk items, you know. As I said, I like this build, just need to be tweaked. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 07/30/05 03:46</span></i></p>

And, yeah, at lvl 20, Dont take your CON to 23. That has no use. Don't end the build on uneven numbers if you can avoid it. Or it is a requirement for something, like con 21 for Epic DR.

Thanks fellas for the review!  I should have pointed out at the beginning, but the goal of this character is to create an Improved Water Elemental with high AC, high HP, and good damage reduction; sort of an elemental tank. That's why the 26 druid levels for the unlimited improved water elemental. <br><br>With that said, I will drop a Wiz for Con and maybe take my int to 14 at creation.  BTW, I already have a dragon druid/monk build which is great.  However, wanted to try something really different here. Will also drop a wiz feat for Armor Skin, too.<br>_________________<br>TeoDeathDealer<br>Member of SoulForge PW (Action)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TeoDeathDealer on 07/30/05 13:41</span></i></p>
