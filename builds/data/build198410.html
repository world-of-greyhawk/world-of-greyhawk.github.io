<b>Playable from level 18 - 40 .. PvM or PvP Build</b><br><b>Difficult to play until level 18</b><br><br><br><b>Libertine Defender    <br>Bard14/ Shadowdancer10 / WeaponMaster16</b> <br><br>Also known as the Versatile Rake and the Exquisite Dandy, the Libertine Defender is a build that requires extreme patience and skill.  It's a build that never actually matures until somewhere in the mid to late 20's, and even that is questionable.  The Libertine Defender comes from the city streets, and courts both high women and low.  He swings into battle with a deadly hand axe and shield, and the handaxe, keened, will crit on a 16-20/x4.  With a naked AB of 43, he can effortlessly raise it to <b>56</b> without any items, and then is all but impossible to hit with both Epic Dodge and Improved Invisibility.  <br><br> If he needs more of a defensive presence he can quickly make his AC 44 without any items.  Combined with Epic Dodge and Improved Invis, he is nigh impossible to hit.  With no magic items at all, he challenged a 40th level buffed fighter with magic gear and made mince-meat of him with just an ordinary handaxe.  He averaged 1 critical in every attack routine.  The Libertine Defender also is highly skilled in many areas, and is able to max Hide, Move Silently, Spellcraft, Tumble, Discipline, a 23 Perform, 30UMD, and a 20Concentration.  And, when all else fails, he can still Hide in Plain Sight.<br><br>The Libertine's saves are his weakness.  He does sport a 36 Reflex and backs it up with Improved Evasion and Defensive Roll.  His Fortitude Save is low, thus Epic Fortitude was chosen.  His Will save is also low.  However, he supports that with Slippery Mind, Bardsong, and Protection from Alignment(lasts 14 hours) which should more or less take care of any Will Save issues.<br><br>If he can get access to a Charisma-boosting item, he will also gain accesss to 5th level Bard spells.  <br><br>Human<br>14Bard/10SD/16WM<br>Alignment: Any non-lawful<br><br>Str11<br>Int 14<br>Wis8<br>Dex17(30)<br>Con10<br>Chr14<br><br>Hit Points= 324<br>Naked AC w/Shield: 30<br>Naked AB: 43/38/33/28<br><br>Buffed/Hasted/BardSong/CurseSong (no items)<br>AC: 46(51 in Expertise)<br>AB: 56/51/46/41/36<br><br><br>1Bard, Dodge, Martial Weapon Proficiency<br>2Bard<br>3Bard, Weapon Focus: Hand Axe<br>4Bard, Dex18<br>5Bard<br>6Bard, Mobility<br>7Bard<br>8Bard, Dex19<br>9ShadowDancer, Expertise<br>10Shadowdancer<br>11Shadowdancer<br>12Shadowdancer, Spring Attach, Dex20<br>13Shadowdancer<br>14Shadowdancer<br>15Shadowdancer, Whirlwind<br>16Shadowdacner, Dex21<br>17WM<br>18WM, Weapon Finesse<br>19WM<br>20WM, Dex22<br>21Bard, Great Dex I<br>22WM<br>23WM<br>24WM, Great Dex II, Dex25<br>25WM<br>26Shadowdancer<br>27Shadowdancer, Epic Dodge<br>28WM, Dex26<br>29WM<br>30WM, Great Dex III<br>31WM<br>32WM,  EWF: Handaxe, Dex28<br>33Bard, Improved Crit: Handaxe<br>34WM<br>35WM<br>36WM, Epic Prowess, Epic Fortitude, Dex29<br>37Bard<br>38Bard<br>39Bard, Curse Song<br>40Bard, Dex 30<br><br>Fort:19(28)<br>Reflex:36(44)<br>Will:18(26, and still slippery mind, protection from Align)<br><br>Final Skills:<br>Hide: 51<br>Move Silently:51<br>Perform:23<br>Discipline:43<br>Spellcraft:45<br>Concentration:20<br>UMD:30<br>Tumble:40<br>Intimidate:4<br><br><i>Favored Spells</i><br><br>1st: Protection from Alignment(1 hour per level)<br>2nd: Cat's Grace, Bulls Strength, Ghostly Visage, See Invisibilty<br>3rd: Keen Edge, Wounding Whispers, Invis Sphere<br>4th: Improved Invis, Warcry<br>5th: Ethereal Visage<br><br>Other Features: <br><br>Curse Song:  Enemy suffers -2 hit/-3damage/-3AC with no save<br><br>Shadowdaze: 1x/day, lasts for 5 rounds<br><br>Shadow Evade: when he runs out of Improved Invis, this is a good back up.

He would do well in PvM, and may even have some success solo.  And even though he seems a bit limited in weapon choice, he can still maintain a good AB with no Weapons of Choice.  It should be noted that this build would have extreme difficulty surviving solo until he reaches Level 18 and can gain Weapon Finesse.  The build would work much faster if one abandoned the Handaxe Template and just went with a finessable weapon from the Simple list (i think it's only sickles and maces).  A Mace wouldn't be a bad alternative.  You lose one crit modifier and the ability for him to keen edge it, but it would make him a bit more versatile and would also allow him to take Weapon Master at level 13.  This would effectively raise the AB by one, and you could still gain Epic Dodge by lvl 27.  It would also free up a feat in Epic, and allow you to take Armor Skin, Lingering Song or Extra Music, or to even drop Epic Fortitude and take two more Great Dex feats for even 1 more AB increase.  In that model, his naked AB would be 45.  And his AC would improve by one.  However, I am a fan of the Handaxe.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/14/07 13:37</span></i></p>

Interesting build Grizz (love your backstories on your builds). Just a thought: if one were to give up the martial proficiency and choose from the simple weapons list, I'd recommend the Sickle. You can cast Keen Edge on it for a better critical chance... and nobody uses sickles, so you get style points, too. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

One note.  I am fairly sure that you will need a base 15 Charisma in order to cast 5th lvl bard spells.  If you do not have the requisite base Charisma, you do not get the opportunity to choose a 5th lvl bard spell.  A charisma item will not help.<br><br>Otherwise, I like it.  I would prolly go 17/10/13 for a better bard song over the extra feat and ab increase, but I am a bardophile, so that is a personal preference. (truth be told, I would consider 23/10/7.  Lose just one feat, but get access to Lasting Inspiration or even great dex or chr as the bard feat.)  Great concept, though.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.rpgmods.net/forgottenworlds/phpBB2/" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

I had someone recently sell me on the idea that 5th level Bard spells aren't a necessity.  I disagreed, but after built this character, I tend to agree with him (if you're out somewhere, you can say "I told you so").  <br><br>But anyways, I feel that it is always good to go deeper into Bard if you can.  However, going any deeper would really require a stronger commitment to Charisma.  At the expense of Dexterity.  I already sank 7 feats into getting Weapon Master, and by Jove I'm gonna get my money's worth.  I really felt 19 were in order, but that watered down the 4th level spell casting power.  14Bard gives a nice even 3 4th level spells, and the Songs are roughly the same in potency.<br><br>And besides, he's a rake, a Beau Brummel, a fop.
