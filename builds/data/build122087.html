Torias was the one who pointed me to epic builders way back in 2003 or 2004.  ITs been awhile.  He and a few others were cutting edge in their day. Take a walk through the bioware epic builds page and notice the authors of those buils.. anuis, torias, mith, cd,.. these are builders that had IMPACT on bioware and nwn, not just in some pw somewhere, but the GAME itself.  <br><br>I find it sad that you are so inept with using monks that you feel it is essential that you blame a 5 year old post for your loss!  What's next, you gonna sue your donut shop for making you fat?   Or, sue the cable tv networks for making you lazy?

Level 5 Cleric slots, yeah, that's the most common piece of equipment in all Neverwinter Nights. Geez, I wonder why the builder of this pure build didn't think of that.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Spell levels 2-5 (even domain spells) are not available till you obtain the required number of cleric levels for them.
