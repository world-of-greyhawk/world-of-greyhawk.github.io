I like it!  The ONLY thing thats missing, IMHO, for a proper defender, id try to take dwarfaxe!  It should be free to a dwarf, but alas it isnt  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">    That's the only thing i would change, if i could (and im not sure if you can without loosin epic prowess <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  )<br><br>Peace

Yes, I wish I could have taken the dwarven war axe also, but I believed the cost was just too high.<br><br>Also, I meant Dev Crit and Damage Reduction with a Ftr/DwD/WM.

I think this one's really good.<br><br>Tho it has low AC i s'pose the DR'll take care of that nicely. But how much DR will you actually get eventually? Just wondering...<br>This one seems to be highly playable, althought its RPG capabilities may not be quite so good a the charisma is 6. But i think it'll get through anyway.<br><br>Nice work man!

That posted AC should be higher depending on how many ranks he invested in Tumble (not sure). It's 10(Base) +1(DEX) +4(20 cc'ed Tumble - max possible AC from Tumble in this build) = 15(naked) at level 40. Add in +8(full plate) +3(tower shield) = 26.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

He wrote the AC in plate and tower shield without the tumble ranks bonus, it seems.<br>Nice build, well done! Unfortunately going for dev crit means feat starvation. You miss AS and your saves suck and there's no way to boost them (equipment apart).<br><br>Welcome to the guild<br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Yes, I had a couple of brain freezes.  Tumble and spellcraft both have 20 ranks in them, which, as was pointed out, would give him a 26 AC, and +4 ST against any spells cast against him.  <br><br>And, as for the DR (the other brain freeze), he gets 18 DR at level 39 (9 for the DD levels and 9 for the 3 Dam Reductions.<br><br>And yes, his saves aren't the best, but his DR and hitpoints do, IMHO, make up for that.<br><br>And he can be RP'd, but as a grouchy dwarf (as I am mostly  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   )<br><br>Thanks for the compliments.<br><br>Rooker<br>_________________<br>With great strength comes great power.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Rooker1963 on 12/07/05 02:17</span></i></p>
