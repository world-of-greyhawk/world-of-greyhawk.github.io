I'm not impressed with the Cleric's Epic Spells so I opted not to pursue that route. The point there was that Epic Spell Penetration would make little difference for this character, so another feat might be a better choice.<br><br>In addition, Cinnabar Din had suggested this path:<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Pre-epic, go CLC 17/CoT 3. That will push your CoT 4 level and bonus feat into epic levels. This would allow you to take your WIS to 32 if you want (a GRT WIS from the extra epic CoT bonus feat, and a second one replacing the ESPen feat, if you go with my advice I realize you lose a BAB to end at +15 for only 3 attacks, but with Divine Power active, you get the Fighter BAB as well as the extra attack at your highest AB, so instead of having a final attack sequence of 39/39/34/29/24 (with Divine Power active and Hasted), you'll have 39/39/39/34/29. Just a thought. The drawback is it hinges on a spell.<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->I prefer not to rely on a spell, but others may be attracted to that design.<br><br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br><i>"Where there is life, there is hope." - Grover</i>

i like the idea of a cleric/warrior without armor.  just wondering if you rely on true seeing to keep all that AC against hidden opponents.  or do you have another tactic that works better than relying on this one spell?<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"You cannot pass!"

I think you lose dex and dodge ac but not innate monk ac (this build doesn't qualify for any anyway (level 5 = monk ac 1) and monk/wisdom ac.  <br><br>I think you need to keep 4 CoT levels pre-epic for the 4 attacks per round.  <br><br>For what that's worth.<br><br>Interesting build.  Everytime I play around with these classes I cannot let go of the monk.  My variant has 18 cleric/10 CoT/12 Monk.  Which is completely different and yet has to be considered as in the same family.  Like the Whirling Dervish of Torm, which is kind of the mid-point between our builds.

Thanks for the clarifications on Monk AC - shows what I know! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>And yes, the Cleric/Monk/CoT blend appeals to me. I also have a version that's Cleric 29/CoT 10/Monk 1.<br><br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br><i>"Where there is life, there is hope." - Grover</i>
