If it is invisible and can’t be detected (NPC’s without see invisibility or true seeing won’t try to detect it unless they are engaged in combat or a hostile action is performed on them) it can move through creatures unnoticed and apply a non-hostile attack (shadow attack) which will strength drain them to bits and finish them off with a killing blow (magical damage equal to hit points).  All this is done monster after monster and the invisibility is never broken.<br>Since monsters typically do not have blind fight, the shadow attack will catch them flat-footed as well.  Negative energy burst (+8 to shadow fiend strength), and other cleric spells will aid the shadows touch attack vs. the flat-footed target’s AC of 10 + dex modifier (if secured) + size modifier + expertise/improved expertise feats (typically not employed when the monster is not engaged in combat).  All the rest of the target AC is completely negated and there is no save to resist the damage.<br><br>The cleric has hundreds (exaggeration) of ways to buff and heal the shadow.  From negative energy burst and negative energy ray, to spontaneously cast inflict spells, to regeneration and temporary hit points, the cleric can keep his fiend alive.  Plus the fiends immunity to cold, fire, and electricity gives the cleric a one up on casting ice storm, flame strike, and many other spells that normally would damage nearby summons.  <br><br>Typically all the cleric has to do is have the invisible shadow wait back, implode the true-seers (and ability decrease immune), cast greater sanctuary, and the still invisible shadow can come into the combat and pick to pieces the rest of the creatures.<br>Cautions: There is only one shadow summon per day and it lasts 7 hours (At SD 7).  If you need it for clean-up patrol, you will need to keep it alive.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 09/29/09 14:43</span></i></p>

Seriously though, since your fiend is only a lv 7 summon you will need ALL the help you can give him.  I recommend memming 0 implodes (one of the silliest spells in the game) and taking Storm of Vengence in its place.  At 8 lvl, take ALL firestorms as well.  That way, you really can be a caster type to support your minion.  ALl of this is in the details of actual game play and varries from player to player.  I just thought id make the suggestion to make your guy unstoppable.

True-seers in PvM are fairly rare, and those immune to ability decrease are often also immune to mind spells (which negates the SoV stun).  This one summon is, without exaggeration, one of the more powerful, and in many instances able to outdo the fullblown level 29 epic shadowlord.  The big advantage the summon has, is instead of having the monsters fighting for their life, they just stand there and die as the shadow passes through.

Might I suggest trying to fit Zen Archery in somewhere early as this one trick pony's main trick doesn't come until after 20th level? Might make some of those earlier levels a bit easier to survive.

Ok, I believe what I said was taken out of context. Of course the cleric has more powers; I know that. The powers of the cleric are not what I consider tricks. Tricks are little secret weapons like the one emphasized in the build information. Cleric spells and abilities are common to all clerics and hence don't count as tricks.<br><br>I don't play spell casters very often but when I do, usually I like to have something in the background for when the spells run out, especially at lower levels when spells are so limited. Since the cleric in this case is not like a wizard that can just look for something like a rod of frost which hits every time, I am suggesting that zen archery would be that back up (adds 11 to AB by my count over what dex offers).<br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.

Further there is the penalty for shooting close range without point blank, and the ranged damage isn't going to be anything close to the melee once darkfire and greater magic weapon are added.  Yes it does give a huge benefit much later to ranged AB, but it is only marginal in effect when you qualify for the high level spells.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By WhiZard on 09/14/09 10:09</span></i></p>

Well, generally speaking, silent spell can be applied to almost any spell (including damage and healing spells) but extended can only be applied to spells with a duration.  So especially if resting isn't limited, you might not need/want the duration and might want better spellbook management.

Yep, one spell I particularly like to use more slots on is hammer of the gods (keeps enemies that are locked onto my shadow away from it).  Further since this character has HiPS, having long lasting buffs isn't as much of an issue.  There is also icestorm (another spell my shadow is immune to even when cast empowered), that can deal quite a lot of damage.
