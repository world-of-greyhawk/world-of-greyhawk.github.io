With his voluminous black cloak swirling around his feet and his bulk framed by a shock of greasy red hair, the stranger looked more like a mercenary to the patrons of the Hungry Halfling than the performer the lute strapped to his back would have suggested. He bellied up to the bar and ordered strong drink, ignoring the riotous crowds. As the festivities wore on, a young man who was far too into his cups approached the bard the wrong way. Demanding a song, he put his hands on the large man's shoulder. Not dissuaded by the man's cold silence, the young fool persisted too long and slowly, the stranger turned to face him. "You want a song, do you?" he asked. The black cloak spread to reveal a massive pair of scaled red wings. The boy's terror mounted as he saw smoke billowing out of the strangers gritting teeth. The man stood, and from him errupted a shriek filled with all the rage and pain of the Abyss. The bar's patrons joined in with cries of their own; the entire room a horrible and anguished cacaphony. They died down to the man, falling where they had once stood. <br><br>The stranger looked around at the dead laid all around him. His eyes narrowed as he took in the sight carnage. His face hardened as he frowned and sat back down on his stool to finish his drink. <br><br>There are already 12 Bard/Rdd/Blackguard combos in the index, but FinneousJP's comments in another thread helped sort out a few tweaks on my version.

I'll take it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>I got a few more in the wings, including a divine might archer and a 70 death dice per round pvp machine. I will do a bit more research before they go up to avoid a heckling.
