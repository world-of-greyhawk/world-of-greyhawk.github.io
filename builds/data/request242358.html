Hello all,<br><br>I'm planning on playing through SoU and HotU again, and I'm interested in trying something different, since I usually just play pure fighters or paladins. So, I was wondering if you smart builders could help me plan a character. I'm willing to use the PRC. Here's my wish list:<br><br>Ability to open locks and remove traps<br>Stealthy<br>Hide in Plain Sight<br>Keen Sense<br>DEX-based Dual-wield, hopefully with kukris<br>Animal Empathy, so I can talk to the animals in Chapter 1 of SoU.<br><br>I'd hope to get as many of these as possible. Any suggestions are welcome! Thanks in advance for your help!<br><br>Laughing Coyote

This combined with Bane of Enemies (at 21st Ranger level) would give an adequate damage output for some enemies being DEX based.<br><br>More Rogue gives you more skills, more sneak attacks and more Rogue bonus feats available at 10th, 13th, 16th, and so on Rogue levels<br><br>More Shadowdancer improves your Shadow Evade feat<br><br> Up to you really

CoT was for helping the saves. Fighter would/could be better. Just switch the race for Elf, it should still have the same starting abilities, the same feats, everything.<br><br>I had a few problems in HotU, especially the Valsharess, but had I more experience back then some Spell-mantle scrolls would have saved my day. But most of the time high AC and ED at lvl 21 +HiPS sure saves your behinds.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.
