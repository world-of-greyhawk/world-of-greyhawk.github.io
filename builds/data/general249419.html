Anuis's already thinking of having a guild for NWN2, I guess we'll have to change name though, given the lack of epic lvls at the start. "Excellent Character Builders" or "Excellent Builds" guild are some possibilities that come to my mind, but it's just mt 2 cents.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Stand and fight, live by your heart<br>Always one more try, I'm not afraid to die<br>Stand and fight, say what you feel<br>Born with a Heart of Steel!

Check out the NWN2 Bard. Some cool stuff coming their way:<br><br>Bard<br><br>A bard brings forth magic from his soul, not from a book. He can cast only a small number of spells, but he can do so without selecting or preparing them in advance. His magic emphasizes charms and illusions over the more dramatic evocation spells that wizards and sorcerers often use. In addition to spells, a bard works magic with his music and poetry. He can encourage allies, hold his audiences rapt, and counter magical effects that rely on speech or sound. Bards have some of the skills that rogues have, although bards are not as focused on skill mastery as rogues are. A bard listens to stories as well as telling them, of course, so he has a vast knowledge of local events and noteworthy items.<br><br>Class Features:<br>• Alignment Restrictions: Any nonlawful – bards are wanderers, guided by whim and intuition.<br>• Hit Die: d6<br>• Base Attack Bonus: Medium<br>• High Saves: Reflex and Will<br>• Weapon Proficiencies: Simple weapons plus longsword, rapier, short sword, and shortbow.<br>• Armor Proficiencies: Light armor and shields (except tower shields).<br>• Skill Points: (6 + Int modifier x 4 at first level) 6 + Int Modifier.<br>• Class Skills: Appraise, Bluff, Concentration, Craft Alchemy, Craft Armor, Craft Trap, Craft Weapon, Diplomacy, Discipline, Hide, Listen, Lore, Move Silently, Parry, Perform, Sleight of Hand, Spellcraft, Taunt, Tumble, and Use Magic Device.<br>• Spells: A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 10 for 0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). Bards do not suffer from arcane spell failure when wearing light armor: medium and heavy armors still incur the normal failure chance.<br>• Bardic Knowledge: A bard picks up a lot of stray knowledge while wandering the land and learning stories from other bards. Whenever a bard makes a Lore check, he adds his bard level to the result.<br>• Inspiration: The very presence of a bard is a constant inspiration to his companions. Unlike bardic music, bardic inspirations are always active and do not have a limited number of uses, however, the bard may only use one inspiration at any given time. At 1st level, the bard can only inspire courage, but as he increases in level, he gains access to a variety of inspirations from which his companions (and himself) may benefit. There are seven types of inspirations.<br>• Inspire Courage (1st level): This gives a bonus to hit and damage. It starts at +1, and becomes +2 at 8th level, +3 at 14th level, and +4 at 20th level.<br>• Inspire Competence (2nd level): This gives a skill bonus to all allies. It starts at +2 and becomes +4 at 11th level and +6 at 19th level.<br>• Inspire Defense (5th level): This gives a dodge AC bonus to all allies. It starts at +2 and becomes +3 at 10th level, +4 at 15th level, and +5 at 20th level.<br>• Inspire Regeneration (7th level): This heals all party members a certain number of hit points every round. This starts at 2 hit points per round, becomes 4 at 12th level, and 6 at 17th level.<br>• Inspire Toughness (8th level): This gives a bonus to saving throws for all allies. It starts at +1, then +2 at 13th level, and then +3 at 18th level.<br>• Inspire Slowing (11th level): All enemies that come within 20 feet of the bard have to make a Will save (DC 13 + = Bard level + CHA modifier) otherwise they will be slowed down. Initially they are slowed down 15% but at 16th level they are slowed by 30%. There are no further penalties besides movement, unlike the slow spell.<br>• Inspire Jarring (14th level): All enemies within 20’ of the bard suffer a -4 penalty to all Discipline and Concentration checks and -2 to all Will saves.<br>• Bardic Music: Once per day per bard level a bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him (usually including himself, if desired). The bard’s ranks in the Perform skill, and in some cases his bard level, determine what bard songs he can use. Bardic music has a duration of 10 rounds, unless an individual song specifies otherwise.<br>• Countersong (Req: Perform 3): This song puts a buff on the targeted ally that lasts for 10 rounds or until discharged. Any hostile magic spell that would affect the countersong’s target has to make a Spell Resistance check of 10 + levels of bard the singer possesses. Whether the spell is blocked or not, the counter-song is discharged.<br>• Fascinate (Req: Perform 3): Every hostile creature within 90 feet must make a Will save (against a DC of 11 + ½ the bard’s level + the bard’s Charisma modifier). This is an enchantment (compulsion) mind-affecting ability. If the target fails this save, then they are dazed for as long as the song is playing and the bard is within 90 feet of them. If a creature is attacked, or is within 10 feet of a creature being attacked, the effect ends for that creature, though anyone who fails their saving throw will be dazed for at least one round. There is a cool down of 10 rounds before this ability can be used again. Fascinate effects up to one enemy per level of the bard.<br>• Haven Song (Req: 3rd level, Perform 6): This song renders all enemies who fail a Will save (DC 11 + ½ the bard’s level + the bard’s Charisma modifier) to be unable to attack the bard, unless the bard takes hostile action against them or their allies (for example, attacking or casting a harmful spell). The Fascinate and Cloud Mind songs do not count as hostile actions.<br>• Cloud Mind (Req: 6th level, Perform 9): This is a more potent, single-target version of the Fascinate bard song. The saving throw DC is increased to 14 + ½ the bard’s level + the bard’s Charisma modifier, and enemies being attacked nearby don’t break the effect. There is a 5-round cool down before this ability can be used again.<br>• Ironskin Chant (Req: 9th level, Perform 12): This song provides damage reduction 5/- to the party for 4 rounds.<br>• Song of Freedom (Req: 12th level, Perform 15): At 12th level a bard gains this ability which allows them to do the equivalent of a break enchantment spell, with the caster level being equal to the bard’s spell level.<br>• Inspire Heroics (Req: 15th level, Perform 18): This song inspires either the bard or a single targeted ally. For 5 rounds, the inspired creature gains a +4 dodge bonus to AC and +4 morale bonus to saving throws. Additionally the inspired creature gains +4 temporary hit points per level. There is a cool down of 20 rounds before this ability can be used again.<br>• Inspire Legion (Req: 18th level, Perform 21): This song inspires all allies within 60 feet. The game determines the highest base attack bonus of all allies in the area of effect, and all affected characters now use this as their new base attack. All affected characters get a +4 competence bonus to damage rolls as well. This ability lasts for 10 rounds. There is a cool down of 5 minutes (game time) before this ability can be used again.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Good to hear that max HP are in. When NWN2 was in early development I and others made a bunch of posts asking for max HP on level up and asked members of this guild to head over to the boards and ask for it as well.  Which led to several multi-page threads that were locked for length. Maybe the petitioning and debating worked?  With 20 levels I could probably design and level up a build in 30 mins now.<br><br>Any word on how skills will be handled?  As I understand it, in 3.5 any skill which is a class skill for one of your classes can be increased to the maximum rank while leveling up another class for which it isn't a class skill but you have to pay double for it.  If this is implemented, would that mean that humans with able-learner would have every skill which is a class skill for one of their classes as a class skill all of the time.  That would be freakin' awesome.  Any word on whether Aasimars and Tieflings could take able learner too?<br><br>It looks like it will be fun to have a new platform to build in.  The real fun won't start until we get epic levels.  It would be great to continue this guild in another incarnation for NWN2.  Honestly, the mods here from Bilb0 to CD  have always been great, and can hopefully keep it up while we transition.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

However, that's not a final build of the game, so I'm sure that will be changed. I've not seen a dev post on exactly how the maximum ranks are handled.

All I can say is 4 different classes instead of 3.  Wait untill the bumb the limit to 30 or 40 lvls.  There will be people posting new builds for the next 10 years.

They should do it like in PnP. The same type does not stack. i.e. Bulls doesn't stack with girdles. Both enhancement. But not stacking the rage is just...... I can't believe it.

In fact, that is one of the main reasons for going fb in the 1st place: the class is supposed to be balanced by the after effects of fury and/or rage (winded or exhausted) as well as the uses per day.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Yes, that's the theory, but it isn't balanced by that at all.

In Baldur's Gate summons were so damn crap, seriously, they were meat that served only to resist a few hits for you, BG2 had some summons that dealt more in melee than most of my party members, and in Icewind Dale 2 summons were too overpowerful, a Cleric alone could defeat a full party with level 3 summons (which were actually the best summons).<br><br>I hope they manage well the summons, IMO the weak summons are more balanced, or else non-summoner classes are toast.

Yeah, Thax, that should be possible; I haven't tested it personally, but know for e.g. that when pally or cleric hit a rak with a bolt they've blessed, for said rak, even PC raks, it's instant death. Same is true in terms of dragon immunities/vulnerabilites, or so it seems that most PWs implement. This being true, then it logically follows that clerics should likewise be able to turn PC elementals.   <br><br>Grim, your point re: PnP, well put. While I realize that, in translating the game to digital form, due to code issues and the like, changes and deviations from the so-called standard rules are inevitably necessary, and thus the need for re-balancing forever more. Ah, but for rage not to stack (brbns), to take away pally use of towers and create a new class that can smite ie infidels, and to detract even further from the attractiveness of the races, well ...  <br><br>All this remains to be seen, as to how it all cashes out; then, I'm am all for improvements, and copyrighted games should, like any technology or IP-field, continue to grow and develop. Just as the computer replaced the typewriter, change is good. On the other hand, at what point do the changes so deviate from the thing it was designed to improve, that it becomes not an improvement per se, but an entirely different thing altogether? From what little I've seen so far, NWN2 doesn't by any means go that far, so hardcore D&amp;D fans, gripes aside of course, should still be thrilled - def. some great ideas in the works (and others, well, not so good - then, only increases the need for our guild to continue, so we's can figure out how to gets around all the so-called "not so goods" <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    <br><br>In the meantime, it's great to know our home remains: this be a wonderul community of course! And, I don't know about all of you, but I intend on enjoying all those great non-humans for as long as is humanly possible since they be (and always were) what makes the game so much more interesting and colorful <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 08/21/06 04:02</span></i></p>

You can tell the players that play the "crazed" voice set in game and those that do not!   LOL   If you can harm an undead shape with holy weapons and turn them with a cleric, it is quite easy to conclude that turnin ele shapes is the next in line!  Maybe its the last thing that pvprs have to try!   Oh, maybe its cuz they arent that good in nwn... but what do know bout druids!<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/08/06 16:20:00 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I think avado answered your question like no other could... </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Depends on the PW.<br><br>Then, in terms of testing things, how many of us pick elemental domain for our clerics? It should work; unfortunately, though, what *ought* to be is not always the same as what any given PW actually does (and some of them do the darnedest things).<br><br>Nevertheless, there's *always* a weakness in each and every class -- NWN2 proposes to do a lot of things, but that every class has a weakness, doesn't change that - and hence, our continued need to exploit &amp; improve via multi-classing (and soon, we get 4 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    <br><br>Oh, must say though, it's great to see that Avado here is enthusiastic and ecstatic about some of the changes bein' proposed for a certain class (can we guess what his fave class is?
