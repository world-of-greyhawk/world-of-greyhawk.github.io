The Barely Arcane Archer (Ultimate Ranger 23/Harper Scout 2/Arcane Archer 15)<br><br>I’ve made an attempt to build an Arcane Archer using Ultimate Ranger here.<br>Race was selected for pure power-gaming purposes.<br>I chose Harper Scout to qualify for Arcane Archer because it has a decent skill list, no experience penalty, and I didn’t see the character as evil. Between them that ruled out all the other possible choices.<br><br>Race: Avariel<br>Alignment: Any non-Evil<br><br>Ability Scores (Initial/Final)<br>STR   14<br>DEX  20/34<br>CON 12<br>INT   16<br>WIS  10<br>CHA 10<br><br>All Ability increases go to DEX.<br><br>Level &amp; Classes<br>1-23   Ultimate Ranger<br>24       Harper Scout<br>25-39 Arcane Archer<br>40       Harper Scout                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <br><br>Level &amp; Feats<br>1: PBS*, Weapon Finesse<br>2: Favoured Enemy- Undead<br>3: Rapid Shot<br>4: WF: Longbow*<br>5: -<br>6: Called Shot<br>7: Improved Favoured Enemy*, Favoured Enemy- Outsiders<br>8: -<br>9: IC: Longbow<br>10: -<br>11: Dodge*, HIPS@<br>12: Blindfight, Favoured Enemy- Dragons<br>13: -<br>14: Uncanny Dodge 1@<br>15: Mobility*, Iron Will<br>16: -<br>17: Favoured Enemy- Constructs, Sneak Attack +3D6<br>18: Alertness<br>19: Improved Inititive*<br>20: Fast Movement@<br>21: Bane of Enemies<br>22: Favoured Enemy- Elementals<br>23: EWF: Longbow*, Dodge FE Bonus@<br>24: Armour Skin, GRT DEX I (HS Bonus Feat)<br>25: -<br>26: -<br>27: Epic Prowess<br>28: -<br>29: -<br>30: Superior Inititive<br>31: -<br>32: -<br>33: Epic Will<br>34: -<br>35: -<br>36: GRT DEX II<br>37: -<br>38: GRT DEX III (AA Bonus Feat)<br>39: GRT DEX IV<br>40: -<br>*Ultimate Ranger Bonus Feat<br>@Ultimate Ranger Special Ability<br><br>Final Stats<br>HP (Maxed): 402<br>AC (Naked): 32<br>AB (Longbow): +54/+49/+44/+39<br>AB (Rapier): +43/+38/+33/+28<br>Damage (Longbow): 1D8+8 (Critical 19-20/x3)<br>Damage (Rapier): 1D6+2 (Critical 18-20/x2)<br>Fortitude: 23<br>Reflex: 32<br>Will: 22<br>BAB: 30<br><br>Skills<br>She has a grand total of 301 skill points to distribute.<br>I divided them as follows:- Craft Trap 5, Disable Traps 1, Discipline 43, Hide 43, Listen 43, Lore 6, Move Silently 43, Open Locks 1, Persuade 8, Search 14, Set Trap 10, Spellcraft 17, Tumble 40.<br><br>Magic Item Wishlist<br>Most importantly a mighty bow. A Haste item would also be very useful.<br><br>Strengths<br>The UR Special Abilities make her a much better sneaky archer than a Ranger would be. HIPS, Uncanny Dodge, Sneak Attack and Fast Movement are all useful. Dodge FE Bonus adds +8 Dodge AC against her Favoured Enemies.<br>Bane of Enemies adds +2AB and +2D6+8 Damage against some of the toughest foes she is likely to meet.<br>Her Winter Wolf Animal Companion is quite a useful meat shield. Pity she can’t buff it at all.<br><br>Weaknesses<br>Although her melee AB is OK her melee damage is poor and her HP aren’t great so best avoided where possible I think.<br>Except for Reflexes her saving throws aren’t great although she gets +4 vs. magic from Spellcraft and +2 vs. traps from HS.<br><br>Varients<br>Too many to list but here are a few that occurred to me.<br>Since she should be trying to avoid melee where possible Weapon Finesse could be dropped, maybe for Toughness or Luck of Heroes. This would make her less playable before she gets all her archery feats and UR special abilities though. <br>If more melee presence is required WF, IC and EWF in rapier (or any other finessable weapon) could replace other feats. This would require a bit of juggling around of feats though depending on what was dropped.<br>Bard or Assassain could replace HS. The main benefit would be to give her access to UMD which would be very helpful to her.<br>She could use some more skill points. If she moved some ability points from STR, CON and/or CHA to INT she’d have a few more to play with.<br><br>I have tested the build and it can be built as shown. The manual seems to be wrong about Bane of Enemies. It doesn’t require 5 FE and an Epic Character, just an Epic Ranger. I took a 5th FE anyway and Bane of Enemies could be swopped with EWF: Longbow if there were doubts about the legality of the build.<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Amazon Queen on 07/05/05 02:12</span></i></p>

Sneak Attack should be noted as an UR Special Ability as well. Too late to edit now <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br>I do try and proof-read these things before posting, honest <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif"><br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.
