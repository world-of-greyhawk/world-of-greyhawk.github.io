Playability is wrongly expressed, it is playable from level 1, your Animal Companion does all the work on low levels and you just feed him, that will get you to level 5.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;interesting idea.

25 levels of druid and you don't take enough Wisdom to get 9th level druid spells?  I'd say drop CHA to 28 and boost Wis to 19, unless there's a special reason to have 30?

Argh... After typing up my response I hit the post button onto to have Bioware tell me that I had been logged out, I'll try to reanswer everything and hope I don't have Bioware say "No post for you!" This time.. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cry.gif"> <br><br>-To avado<br><br>First off, I wasn't exactly sure what was meant by playable level, was it to be the level that you aren't completely useless or the level where you're so useless you need 3 other people to make up for your uselessness. I took it as the former, it is possible to play levels 1-5, just not a walk in the park.<br><br>-To Cerolill-<br><br>The AC? Yes that was buffed, It was due to...<br><br>+12 through Divine sheild<br>+5 through Barkskin<br>+2 from Aura of vitality<br>+3 from Sheild of Faith<br>And +4 from haste<br><br>The Healing/War debate was decided by the lack of many healing spells at low level and by the fact that the empowered healing part of the domain affects druid healing spell too. Although if you're into the War domain that would work too...<br><br>Well, I was planning on a mainly unshifted build... I guess the weapon focus could work...<br><br>Total skill values are,<br><br>Animal Empathy 66 (+10)<br>Concentrate 42 (-1)<br>Heal 47 (4)<br>Tumble 20 (-1)<br>SpellCraft 44 (1)<br><br>Next are spells...<br><br>-Sheild of Faith<br>-Protection from alignment<br>-Bless<br>-Barkskin<br>-Bulls strenght<br>-Eagles splendor<br>-Owls Wisdom<br>-Endurance<br>-One with the land<br>-Blood frenzy<br>-Greater Magic Fang<br>-Magic Vestment<br>-Darkfire<br>-prayer<br>-Clarity<br>-Freedom of Movement<br>-Greater Magic Weapon<br>-Divine Power<br>-Death Ward<br>-Spell resistance<br>-Awaken<br>-Haste<br>-BattleTide<br>-Energy Buffer<br>-Greater Stoneskin<br>-Aura of Vitality<br>-True Seeing<br>-Premonition<br><br>I thought balors would be more scaly than furred... My mistake...<br><br>-To Thaxll'ssyllia-<br><br>From what you said about better buffs, the only thing I could really see would be Aura vs Alignment, I guess resurrection and mass healing would be good too though.<br><br>-To Ariel Thomas-<br><br>I suppose I could drop CHA to make room for the 19 WIS...<br><br>Thankyou all for your feedback.

Wow, now thats a proper reply. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">  <br><br>I'm really starting to like the idea of this build, to me its rather fresh and yet quite powerful, at least in low-magic settings (those were always my favourites).<br><br>Thank you for listing skills, spells and buffs. Its really helpful for those of us with less insight and knowledge of the magical system. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>And about the Balors skin... well, I'm not sure, fire may be rather unbeneficial for the fur so perhaps they have scales...

Not only new buffs, but rather stronger buffs, from level 11 to 16 your buffs get stronger:<br><br>Divine Favor improves from +3 to +5<br><br>Magic Vestment improves from +3 to +5<br><br>Shield of Faith improves from +3 to +4<br><br>Higher duration for Divine Power (really strong buff)<br><br>Higher duration for Battletide.<br><br>If you're unshifted Darkfire improves from 1d6+5 to 1d6+8 (you can't buff Darkfire while shifted).<br><br>If you're unshifted Greater magical Weapon Improves from +3 to +5 (you can't buff Greater Magical Weapon while shifted).<br><br>If you're on an environment higher than +4, probably some of this might sound useless, but Darkfire, Divine Power and Divine Favor still work perfectly.<br><br>You don't lose <b>any</b> buff power from Druid 25 to 20, so I think it's better to take those levels on Cleric.<br><br>I also agree with what was said earlier, drop some CHA for WIS, you get good spells on levels 8 and 9, they are more worth it than that amount of CHA.<br><br>If you were to have enough WIS you would also get level 8 Cleric spells with 16 Cleric, at least level 7 Greater Restoration and level 8 Mass Heal are very useful spells you know.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/28/06 23:16:09 (GMT) -- Big Meph<br>Using the 2 ESF's in a dex based sneak build, <i>to me</i>, just looks like you're teasing your diabetic opponent with extra sugar on your whipcream covered chocolate mudcake.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 08/20/07 22:15</span></i></p>

This is a really neat build -- charismatic elementals? I like it; yeah, the divines add quite a bit here, and very interesting (and also unique!).<br><br>I agree with a wee tad more wis for spells --can drop a couple cha (you've eagle's so can well afford it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">            grabbing ninth lev druid spells; as to cleric, hmmmm, interesting idea, Thax, and yeah, many ways one can go here, most true, and some really nice thinking; thinking also though that, with 25 druid (undispellable, reasonable buffing and healing, too, and since big, bad elementals are unltd. usage at 26 druid ... just a thought <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">            <br><br>As to animal empathy -- sweet! Yeah, that's a really nice trick, and incredibly practical, too (do the other druids and/or rangers, or mages for that matter like it when you steal their pet? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">            And with a pet of your own (and ability to empathize), really helps the early levels, too, I agree. Nicely done. As to what (or who) is affected by the animal empathy, doesn't work against balors (who be outsiders) but it does work against all neutral or hostile animals (incl. dires), beasts (e.g., gray renders) and magical beasts (incl. gargoyles), NPC and PCs alike. Dominates NPCs (become your pet) and dazes PCs ... and great for stealing (animal, incl. dire, beast or magical beast) summons, too. The trick, in terms of NPCs and another's summons, is to make sure that your own pet doesn't attack the thing you want to "tame" b/f you empathize it (but it's pretty fast otherwise, can dominate one extra pet at a time (release and/or redominate as you want). Oddly, hellhounds aren't affected (they're outsiders), nor are dragons (a specie all their own) - but just about everything else having fur, horns or wings ... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">        <br><br>So, yeah, ESF makes a ton of sense; as to the SF, depends. If can bring up the skill via the use of say a cha item (when added to eagle's buff), could pick up say imp.crit: unarmed for your elementals ... Epic prowess is also something to consider picking up (works as human and your shapes); in terms of pre-epics, BF as Bromium says is a good thing to have (although your elementals are crit and sneak immune (nice!) Blind Fight lets you fight against the invis., concealed so definitely worth considering, as is KD - with all that Earth strength and size, yes? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">            I'd consider dropping impr.expertise or toughness for it (your shapes got plenty HPs, and you've plenty DR and buff spells, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">          <br><br>Otherwise, really neat!!!
