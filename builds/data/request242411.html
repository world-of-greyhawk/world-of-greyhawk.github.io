I play on a level 30 server:<br><br>-RDD requires 12 levels of Bard or Sorc<br>-Shadowdancer is dissallowed<br>-Minimum of 3 levels per class taken<br>-No perma-haste or true seeing<br>-No immunities beyone 5/- Element on items<br>-No weapons or armour beyond +3 enchantment<br>-No Divine Spells have been capped other than Darkfire<br>-Any build must make logical RP sense<br><br>I really want a casting focussed Cleric... EVIL Cleric <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> <br><br>I think that perhaps a pure Cleric would work best because it would have incredibly high Implosion DC's and what-not. <br><br>Now, I know that you are all thinking I am dumb because nobody could screw up a pure Cleric that focusses on Casting, but I want it to have good playability all the way. XP caps wont be a bother but dieing constantly will get on my nerves, so if anyone has a build at hand that has good playability until 30th level that has a great implosion DC, please share.

Update:<br><br>I have tried a build out, a pure Cleric 30, and the end result was a DC 40 Implosion, buffed.<br><br>I took Epic Spell Focus Evocation which added +6, and the rest of my Epic Feats went into Greater Wisdom.<br><br>With all of that the DC was 40, though if I had a few +2 Wisdom Items I could count on a DC 43 vs. Fortitude.<br><br>Is this the best I could get it to? Is there no way to get it higher?<br><br>I was also wondering if Implosion can still effect those who are immune to Death Magic, since Implosion is Evocation rather than Necromancy.<br><br>But more importantly, how can the DC get any higher? 40 is alright, but I would like to push it as far as I can.

The highest possible DC is 48, and that's with a maxed out WIS (all 10 Grt WIS feats taken, and an ending WIS of 38) and +12 to WIS from items/spells (for a buffed WIS of 50). <br><br>For a level 30 character, I think the highest possible unbuffed DC is 38 or 39. Then add any extra from buffing/items for a max possible of 44 or 45.

The highest Implosion DC at 30th lvl is 39, which can become 45 with a capped WIS. Cleric 20/CoT 10 (all CoT in epic) gets this result for example, with a final WIS of 32.<br><br>Implosion ain't no death magic, so death ward does not protect against it.

Well I got the low 40's so I would say that is quite well concidering the maximum. My only concern is playability. I took Strength Domain for Divine Power so I could fight decently, and Travel Domain for the obvious Haste. Is this the best idea? And does anyone have any ideas as to what feats should or could be taken to make the build better or easier to play? I was thinking of the Expertise feats for casting...<br><br>(Does Expertise modify your ability to cast? My server hasnt changed it so it will affect it however the engine normally allows)<br><br>...Should I even bother with Weapon Focuses or is it too much trouble and a waste of time for a casting Cleric?<br><br>Any other tips?

*shakes head and sighs* OK... I was just on the forums on the server I play on, and it was just decided that Implosion is too powerful and will be capped somehow. Seriously what bad timing... they -JUST- decided <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"> <br><br>Ugh...

If you like to use instant damage spells, you might want to think about taking "Still or Silent Spell" feat since that will allow you to use your fav spell in your next spell lvl slot.  You can't "extend" an instant spell.<br><br>example:<br><br>Hammer of the Gods is a lvl 4 spell. A lvl 13 Cleric has (without counting wis bonus spells) 5 4ths, 4 5ths, 3 6ths and 2 7th lvl spells.<br><br>So that means he could use Still, Empowered and Maximized to get 14 Hammers total.<br><br>Note:  Silent Spell could be used as well instead of Still.  (might be a better choice imho.)<br><br>===<br>Of course, Implosion is 9th and this tactic won't help there.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 06/02/06 14:32</span></i></p>

I'm actually a big fan of that little tactic. You can get virtually infinite Call Lightnings for Druids or Hammer of the Gods for Clerics (etc.)<br><br>And even though I am likely sacking the caster-cleric because of the DM choices, I am curious about Silent Spell. What is the advantage of it? <br><br>I never used it IG so all I can assume is it makes your spell virually unhearable. But how does that really help you? Does it allow you to cast and stay invisible since you dont have to reveal yourself through speech?

Bumps your spells up one level, and allows you to cast if you've been Silenced. It's probably a better choice than Still Spell for a Cleric, since they can already cast in armor without spell failure.
