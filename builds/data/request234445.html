Hi, <br><br>I am looking for a halfling build that will be able to defeat a number of various shadowdancer builds for PVP. Neither group is allowed to use any spellcasters, except for bards. Magic is limited to approx +5, with a few armors going to +7/+8. I was thinking thinking of a RAN/WM/SD(5?) to fight fire with fire but I am not sure what levels of the three class(es). Any suggestions?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Silent

Are you allowed to use magic scrolls, wands, etc.? If so, then take Bard or Rogue for UMD so you can cast True Seeing. The only way to hit a shadowdancer is to be able to see him, and for that you need true seeing though scroll, wand, spell, or item (or dragon shape, but DS is out if Druid is not allowed).<br><br>The only other things that will work is area effects, like a Bard's Warcry spell, or a Barbarian's Terrifying Rage. Actually, if fear immunity is not allowed, a Barbarian build with Terrifying Rage will work very well - the SD's will become terrified and just stand there, even if they were in hiding. Some Blackguard or Rogue or Assassin levels on top will let you do sneak damage while they stand there terrified, and get you some other bonuses as well.<br><br>TM

Oh, the other obvious thing to do is to max Listen, and take SF/ESF: Listen. If you do that and have a high level bard use Song/Curse Song, you will have a very good chance of detecting the sneaking SD's. If you detect them as a barbarian, do not attack immediately, let them sneak up close to you, then activate Terrifying Rage.<br><br>TM

Thanks for the quick response!<br><br>The ability to use scrolls, wands, etc is not allowed. As well, we are limited to the non-evil alignments. <br>We thought of the Barbarian and tried some terrifying rage builds but they were not effective, due to item immunities. <br><br>Silent

Hmm, no scrolls, no True Seeing items, and they can get immunity to fear from items. That does make it tougher.<br><br>Since you want a halfling, I would go dex-based, and get Epic Dodge (rogue/Fighter). Max your Listen, take ESF: listen, and be sure to have a 20+ level bard in the party with Lasting Inspiration. If there are items that boost Listen, wear them (i.e. Sentinel Battleaxe, Watchman's helm, etc.) Have the bard buff everone at the start (so you have +7 or more to all skills, including Listen, so everyone's Listen is at 60+). As soon as the battle starts he should use his Curse Song. Have at least 1 elf in the party for automatic spot and listen checks. Try to spot them when they sneak up on you and spam IKD at them. Having some characters with Dev Crit would be a good idea also. Some DwD's might be good since they will resist sneak damage (assuming the SD's are also Rogues or Assassins with sneak damage). Last, you may want to have an SD or two in your party sneaking alongside you, so they can get off a sneak attack against the enemy after they attack.<br><br>Oh, have the Bard spam some area spells like Balagarn's Iron Horn to try to knock them down, IceStorm and Dirge, etc. You may want to have him/them buff the whole party with Imp Invis at the start as well.<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 03/21/06 16:19</span></i></p>

A Bard/PM/DD (or Wizard if you can't change alignment) is also good for resisting sneak damage. In fact, it's great! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  That's the party's tank, heh.<br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm

No wizard, Finn. If you want R/SD/WM, go ranger21/sd3/WM16, but it won't be the easiest to level if you are dex-based.

His first post said that its for group PvP, and the rules are no spellcasters except for bard. I was presuming that included Clerics, or he should certainly be using a Cleric to cast True Seeing on the whole party.<br><br>TM
