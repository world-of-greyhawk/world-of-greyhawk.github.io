<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif"> <br><br>don't know what you mean, but if you are raising any stat beyond 30 i would say it is your primary stat and the boosts there are important.  you don't get any additional bonuses for any class that i can think of, but your question is rather vague.<br>for example a half-orc barbarian with 30 vs 32 in str gets another point to AB and another point to damage.  there are some feats life Self Cconcealment and Dragon FOrm which require a 30 or higher to select them, so naturally while you are at 30, why not hit 32 or so?<br><br>-c

lol, ya thats too vague. lil more info might help. but ill try to answer the best i can. i would say of course. i know i try and  alocate towards my class, depending on how you want your build to go. but honestly the only stat that needs to be high is your STR for Improved Knock Down. the higher the stat the easier it is for you to KD your opponent. STR modifiers also work to benifit you in your discipline skill. on my server you need to max out discipline otherwise you'll be finding yourself laying on your arse.<br><br>other than that and disarm, look up this website. its got everything you need to know about classes and what feats they can receive if you have the right ability scores.<br><br><a href="http://www.nwnwiki.org/Main_Page" target="_blank">http://www.nwnwiki.org/Main_Page</a>

Feats opening up when your stat hits 30? DEX 30 is prereq for Self Concealment. WIS 30 for Dragonform. Perhaps some more, but if so, I can't remember right now.

Nope there's no benefit to base stats over 30.  The bonuses just stop.  Yep that's it.<br><br>On a serious note:  as appropriate to your build, you'll keep gaining attribute bonus.  But as far as I'm aware no feats require more than 30 in an attribute.<br><br>In order to get those feats however, you usually end up with 32 in your prime attribute because you don't want to be picking your target feat at level 40 - especially because the only way to get it there is to land a bonus feat level on 40.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

You need a high <i>AB</i>. A high DEX character can use IKD just as effectively as a high STR character.<br><br>All KD (both KD and Imp KD) attempts are made at -4 AB. The skill check is your opponent's Discipline roll vs your attacks (d20 + AB - 4). For every size category larger than your opponent your character is, your opponent gets a -4 penalty on the skill. Imp KD allows you to KD opponents 1 size larger than you normally could and your character is treated as 1 size category larger than he actually is for the purposes of the Discipline skill check. Three examples follow.<br><br>1) Your character is Human and trying to KD another Human character. Your opponent has a Discipline skill of 40 with a +10 STR modifier. Your AB is +55. You roll a 15 on your KD attempt. Result: 15 (d20 roll) +55 (AB) -4 (KD attempt penalty) = 66.

Result: you KD your opponent.<br><br>2) Your character is Human and trying to Imp KD another Human character. Your opponent has a Discipline skill of 40 with a +10 STR modifier. Your AB is +55.

Your opponent rolls a 17 on the d20 skill check roll for a 17 (d20 roll) + 50 (Discipline ranks + modifier) -4 (size differential, as your character is treated as 1 size larger due to Imp KD) = 63. Result: you KD your opponent.<br><br>3) Your character is a Gnome and trying to KD a Human character. Your opponent has a Discipline skill of 40 with a +10 STR modifier. Your AB is +55. You roll a 15 on your KD attempt. Result: 15 (d20 roll) +55 (AB) -4 (KD attempt penalty) = 66. Your opponent rolls a 15 on the d20 skill check roll for a 15 (d20 roll) + 50 (Discipline ranks + modifier) +4 (size differential, as your character is a size category smaller) = 69. Result: you fail to KD your opponent.<br><br>It doesn't matter if your AB comes from STR or DEX when you attempt a KD or Imp KD.<br><br>STR adds to your Discipline skill chack though (as you mentioned), so it's nice to have it high if your opponent is trying to KD your character.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

If you are a caster there is, it improves the DC of the spell being cast and the total number of spells that you know in your class.
