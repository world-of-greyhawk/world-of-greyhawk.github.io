Hi there<br><br>Im going to start playing on a server called avlis (again) and i need a good pvm / pvp build (pvp build much later in game though) pvm to get the levels up first though. I want a sorcerer / anything to be able to take the hits and even deal some damage in combat (dont mind going ranger in that) wouldnt mind some blackguard as will have high starting charisma (one race that im going to be adds +5 to charisma) long as i can take the hits spellcast and deal some damage. (note need pvm desperate for first 20 levels hard enough to level as it is on server) If not i dont mind playing a cleric for buffing and melee / ranged combat any will help. Ive searched on the engine for sorcerer and nothing much there.<br><br>Note COT and RDD and DD have been disabled on server<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Note COT and RDD and DD have been disabled

Well, if you want to hit in melee, you could as well go with maybe Fighter, Cleric or Paladin Pre-epic and then all epics with Sorcerer, your DCs and Spell Penetration will be low though, but it will fight rather good, and I would still bet IGMS would hit, as well as Mestil's Acid Sheath, that one's great for going melee, check my specialized build for Mestil's: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "238107", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Arcane Wall V2</a> however, that build uses Dwarven Defender, so it's out of your range.<br><br>I don't recall specifications of your server.......<br><br>I'd say a Fighter 6 / Cleric 15 / Sorcerer 19 would go great for low magical server... if that's the case...<br><br>Maybe you could go with a Fighter 12 / Weapon Master 7 / Sorcerer 21 or similar, I like Weapon Master scythe criticals, that one would work better on high magical server.<br><br>If you really want a strong caster, you would need a few Cleric levels only for Divine Power and go the rest Sorcerer (I don't remember which Domain gives Divine Power earlier but there is one), again, only real strong in low magical server, since Divine Power counts against the +20 cap, and will really hurt if there are strong weapons about.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 04/30/06 18:29</span></i></p>
