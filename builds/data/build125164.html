Corvette is an ongoing project to create a formidable pc for any combat circumstance.  With her massive SR and AC she is capable of shunning almost every attack away weather it be a sharpened steel blade or a barrage of arcane flames. She is however one of my favorite builds due to the ability to leave her standing there in the middle of battle whilst you run for that much needed toilet break you've been putting off for the last hour, to come back and find her surrounded by either corpses or alot of attackers all getting nowhere against you! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> <br><br>Corvette - MageHunter<br>Sex: Female<br>Race: Elf<br>Allignment: LE (and lawful can be used but assassin lvls must be replaced by rogue and you need 4 rogue lvls not 3)<br>Attributes:<br>STR 10<br>DEX 16<br>CON 12<br>WIS 16<br>INT 14<br>CHA 08 (ugly i know but munchkinism is an ugly business!)<br><br>Level Progression:<br>01.

AC can reach 55 and thats without considering Imp Expertise and any more DEX and WIS based AC bonuse Corvette WILL have (you'd be a fool not to!) I've had AC above 70 before *laughs at all those swords gliding past her in combat* *frowns unhappily at arcane archers - then grabs the arrow out of the air and stabs them in the eye with it* <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>Naked AB: +30/+27/+24/+21/+18<br>With 2 castings of True Strike AB becomes easily enough to hit those overly armoured opponents with one of your 36 stunning fists (DC 35, i calculated it as 33 i think but it showed 35 in the txt box :S shame!), a knockdown or your quivering palm (also DC 35).<br>BAB: 25<br><br>Maxed hp: 349 i think (its late forgive my maths if its wrong.)<br><br>Fortitude: 23<br>Reflex:    27 (+3 against magic attacks with spellcraft)<br>Will:      27<br><br>Spell Resistance: a whopping 62!! (my previous version had SR 67 so to make her completely immune to any spell (that SR negates) fired by a pure lvl 40 wizard with +6 Spell Pen (caster lvl+d20+spell pen feats) which i work out to be a max of 66.  A few natures balances, morks dis's and breaches will reduce it but the unwise wizards wont know you have such a strong diamond soul untilll its too late!<br><br>On top of that youve got uncanny dodge for lvl 2 of assasin or lvl 3 of rogue so your ac stays nice and tasty. +2d6 death attack (i dont know how the DC is calculated on that but i dont expect it to be very high in this build.) Ghostly visage from youre assassiny nature and all the monkey's abilities to boot.<br><br>If you're wondering why i use DEX 21 and WIS 21 its because most servers have a +5 enhancment peak which gives you for example DEX 26 and WIS 26 which in fact gives me 1 more AC than if DEX and WIS were even. (every little helps.)<br><br>A weakness that i've come accross in PvP is that evil little dev crit thing (DEATH TO DEV CRIT AND ITS USERS!!) however i like to get around that by carrying scrolls of shapechange and using the iron golem as my anti-crit form  even though with such a massive AC your likely to be only hit on a 20 which is a 5% chance reduced to 2.5% with the monks concealment.<br><br>Right I think thats it. Any comments other than "boy that was long" would be appreciated otherwise good night <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_sleep2.gif"> <br><br>TheWildMustang

the build looks good, but i wouldnt rely to heavily on a high magic world to make the build.<br><br>regarless, she is strong without +5 items all over her!<br><br>i would opt for the rouge path, and i dont know if the one lv of wiz is neccessary.  considering you could use UMD for tru strike scrolls.  seems the one lv might work better on another odd rogue lv for sneak and more skills...

The reason for my preferance of Assasin to Rogue in this build is that you get Uncanny Dodge at lvl 2 with Assasin whilst only lvl 3 Rogues get this ability and I wanted to maximise my monk lvls for the SR.<br><br>About the wizard i dont think ive come accross many scrolls of true strike. Ive not tried this but i just thought because i have a lvl of wiz cant i make scrolls of true strike?

trying to get ab through the use of true strike is a pain int he butt - in my opinion this build therefore is severely lacking in ab.<br><br>For pvm purposes at least.
