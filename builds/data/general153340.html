I'd say go for a character that does not require a lot in lines of gear.  Clerics do well at level 20.  One can get the DC on their Implosion very high.  And since it is just a level 20 server, with very limited gear (13000 GP per item), people tend not to have the best of saves.  And if they do have good saves, they are usually weaker to melee, which Clerics are also very good at (better than fighters in my opinion).<br><br>It would also depend on the server's rules.  If the server has 'fixed' True Sight so that it does not see people hiding in Shadow, Ranger/ShadowDancer does very well (if you focus everythingo n hiding).  That build would be weaker in melee, and is easy pickings if a Mage catches them, but they would be able to hide from most everything.  If you were go to that route, using a Bow and Arrows is the way to go.<br><br>I also feel that Monks do well at level 20.  Though getting good gear for them tends to be hard (for both Server Vault and Local Vault), but they are very defensive, which is always a plus (outliving everyone is just as good as being able to kill everyone).<br><br>*shruggs*  Just some ideas,<br>kip

In this server there is no Prestige Classes accept Weapon Master and Assassin so i was looking for somone to like give me a Char Build lvl 20 that would help me decide on what i want to be there is alot of Clerics already but i dont care plus you can pick Your Races like Drow Duegar and some of them may have like +2 Str -1 Con but you dont have to do that its just anothere option... But if anyone has any Good lvl 20 Char build that doesnt have Prestige classes in it accept WM and assassin then thats cool but another thing is you can Multiclass until you reach your lvl up at lvl 11.. i know this might be a challenge but can anyone help me here?

Do you want it to be multiclassed? IMO I would not multiclass with a casting class especially an arcane one if you can only get it to level 20. so go pure if you want a caster with good spells (except maybe a cleric, i dono about it). As Kip said celrics are quite good pure at level 20. I imagine a paladin wouldn't be half bad either. Fighters would have the most feats which could make a big difference. You will only gain 5 attribute icreases so don't spread them out too much. I'll try to think up something but i can't promise a build because I'm pretty busy. Those are just some of my thoughts.<br>CS

You can make some crazy char combos for level 20, the lack of prestige class can be limiting though.  Try a Monk 4/fighter 4/cleric 12.  You can have 12 attacks/round with kamas, with plenty of dmg from divine favour/darkfire/wp spec, super high ac and awesome buffs.<br><br>Something like<br>Dwarf<br>str 10<br>dex 15<br>con 16<br>int 12<br>wis 16<br>chr 6<br><br>Lvl 20<br><br>str 10<br>dex 20<br>con 16<br>int 12<br>wis 16<br>chr 6<br><br>Lvl order<br>1 Monk<br>4 Fighter<br>12 Cleric (trickery/travel or if permahaste then war)<br>3 Monk<br><br>feats<br>1 ambidex<br>2 wp finess<br>3 twf, wf kama<br>5 wp spec kama<br>6 extend spell<br>9 dodge<br>12 itwf<br>15 imp crit kama<br>18 <br><br>At level 20 you will have with haste/darkfire/keen edge/bless/divine favour/aid/divine powerx2 and flurry<br>23)(23)(23)(23)23/20/17/14/11/8  23/20 +6(18-20)x2+10fire+5divine.  Though the ab seems small, remember most people get 1, maybe 2 hits at their highest ab, you get 6 hits at your highest ab!!!!<br>Crazy ac too, with 34 ac naked<br><br>I no doubt forgot something since this is off the top of my head, and I always screw up when figuring out ab with divine power so forgive me if things aren't exactly as this says.

I'd still go with evo_dragon's build, just take out the fighter and go 17 cleric 3 monk, or something like that. You can get lv9 cleric spells and all the early monk feats plus 10% increased speed. I'd take healing domain and trickery domain, unless there are no haste items on your server, in which case trickery/travel.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

Also if your very set on getting a figheter weponmaster build you can easily make it yourself. That is a very easy build to make just look at the requirements for weapon master and choose the feats you want. It's relatively simple.<br>CS<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ctasemelka on 09/13/04 21:38</span></i></p>

I played on a level 20 RP PW for some time. Some of my more successful characters were:<br>Cleric 16/Fighter 4<br>Paladin 16/Fighter 4<br>Monk 20<br><br>For cleric domains, I always liked Trickery (for Imp. Invisibility spell), Magic (for stoneskin), Strength (for stoneskin).<br><br>Good luck!<br>Kaliban.
