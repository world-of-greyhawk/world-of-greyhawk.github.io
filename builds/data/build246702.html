The cleric buffs also help with his AB. However, due to the heavy attribute requirements (DEX for SC and WIS for casting), he's weak to the point of being unplayable early on. He can also dual-wield kamas at 36 AB unbuffed. The lack of skillpoints is quite saddening, too.<br><br><b>Pros</b><ul><li>SC5</li><li>Epic Dodge</li><li>Good AC</li><li>Clerical buffs</li><li>UMD</li><li>10 APR</li><li>8d6 Sneak Attack</li><li>Early ED at level 24</li><li>Improved Knockdown to force sneak attacks</li><li>Manageable buffed AB</li></ul><br><b>Cons</b><ul><li>Short on feats</li><li>Short on skills</li><li>Short on attribute points</li><li>Not very playable early on</li><li>Gets his major spells very late</li><li>Poor unbuffed AB (though not overly bad for a build with only 3/4 BAB classes)</li><li>XP penalty (Halfling favours Rogue, mind!)</li></ul><br><br><b>Playable 24-40, PvM and (mostly) PvP</b><br><br>Race: Elf or Halfling (for +1 AC/AB, no dual-wield Kamas)<br><br>Alignment: Chaotic Neutral<br><br>Attributes:<br><br>Starting<br>--------<br>08 Strength<br>20 Dexterity<br>10 Constitution<br>08 Intelligence<br>16 Wisdom<br>08 Charisma<br><br>Ending<br>------<br>08 Strength<br>30 Dexterity<br>10 Constitution<br>08 Intelligence<br>18 Wisdom<br>08 Charisma<br><br>Can drop points from CON to other attributes if you want something else, though the HP is abysmal already.

I'd like to add that Trickery domain isn't very interesting for this build. Instead, I'd recommend Travel and War for an environment with no permahaste.

It may just be my imagination, but you don't appear to have defensive roll anywhere, which would exclude the use of epic dodge. Also, there is a build similar to this (i think it's called "Stabby McStab Stab"), except I don't think it had Self Concealment.

I'm sure you mean SCV or SC5 with that SV5, I'll let you edit it yourself <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>I guess you haven't found any cleric with SCV in the search engine because you can get the concealment out of II via trickery domain.

Until you must rely on saving throws this would be a good PvP build.<br><br>That aside, if you plan to play it then Halfling would be a good choice. With good level-planning you will only have 20% xp-penalty at most and not always that even.<br>You would only lose 1 AB when dual-wielding kama's, but gain 1 AC all the way.

Not bad, like it, but the low cleric levels mean you'll get dispelled a lot.  I'm not sure that SC5 is all that great in a cleric, since with trickery domain you can cast II.  While it is Mordsable, if you are fighting an arcane caster with over 20 levels, getting your buffs dispelled is the least of your concerns compared to the bigby's hand spells and IGMS.  The ability to cast harm against a high AC opponent is also not to be overlooked.   For domains, I would take either war and healing or war and travel if I couldn't get permahaste items.  <br><br><br>All things considered this is one of the better SC 5-ED builds I've seen.  They tend to only be playable in high magic settings, where you can force a battle of the 20s and the extra misses give you the edge.  Thanks to the cleric AC buffs, this one should do alright in mid magic settings.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Easy, the size bonuses do not add to the Character Sheet because they will only work when you fight bigger oponents! the same stuff happens to huge size penalties like when you shift to dragon... if you're a Halfing and fight another Halfing the bonus simply won't exist.

I hate xp penalties, so I was tryin to figure out how to at least postpone the inevitable.  I took halfling (as above) and kept cleric and monk close together..  i think i did pre with m6/c7/r7.  In epic, I got ed at 27, so it is NOT an improvement, just a way to make the xp penalty easier to stomach.  If my math is correct, you can postpone the penalty right up to lv 35 when you take cleric11, which is one heck of alot better than the 40%.  Also, by taking more cleric lvls pre, you get access to more spells earlier which will make things easier 1-23!  The tradeoff is HALFLING and you dont get ED until 27, but everything else (as far as I can tell) would be the same.  <br><br>Thanks again finn for the excellent build idea <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/08/06 16:20:00 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I think avado answered your question like no other could... </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->
