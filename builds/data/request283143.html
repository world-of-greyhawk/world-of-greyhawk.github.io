I am looking for some help on an evil spellsword of destruction.  I am thinking Sorc/BG/RDD but it isn't absolute.  What is needed though is he be the definition of evil.  A Chaotic evil; eats babies for breakfast; Worships Bhaal for fun; nasty sob <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>I want this guy to have:<br>-High Saves:  Ought to be able to laugh at Dev Crits<br>-Dev Crit: His own should be no laughing matter for most anyone else <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br>-Good Buffing:  Level 9 is a Plus (Gate for the RP of it/Mord's for the power) but not an absolute again.  More casting ability the better; especially if it includes Epic Warding<br>-Must wield a Scythe.  Yeah it makes it tougher; but you can't deny the RP fun of a Nasty evil dude with a scythe <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br>-I can live without Autostill; but it would be nice.<br><br>Am I asking too much?  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world

Hm, I would try a Sorcerer RDD Palemaster of some sort, if you want evil and a good Dev. Crit.  Also, you wouldn't need to fear Dev. crits.  <br><br>Or, if you can live w/o RDD, I'd try for a Sorcerer 26 Blackguard 4 Palemaster 10, or something like that.

Hmmm  that is a possibility too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    I hadn't even thought about Palemaster; I was just considering the RDD bonuses to strength in reaching Dev Crit.<br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world

Which is stronger; a Gated Balor or an Epic Vrock?  May actually want to go to BG 16 instead <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world

The best "spellswords" in NWN are Cleric based, since they have the best AB, AC and damage buffs. Bards are the best arcane spellswords with their AB table, songs, class skill selection and spell selection.<br>An evil Cleric/Bard combo will be powerful. You're free to choose your third class. Cleric/Bard/Palemaster and Cleric/Bard/RDD comes to mind. You'll find several builds if you do a search.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 09/15/07 18:07</span></i></p>

Well, dunno about the best "spellswords" when it comes to clerics, but definitely w.o question or doubt do clerics make the best uber-buffers, that is for sure (heh, and me be a paladin fan, and even *I* admit that (yeah, yeah, I see you smiling over there, Avado, waiting for me to *finally* admit that which you already know -- but on the other hand, let's compare our BAB shall we, and uh, that AB once those buffs of yours be spent and/or mord's, ... er, what, where'd he go? ... ? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">      <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">      <br><br>While cleric/RDD are awesome, this is true, so, too, are Sorcerer/RDDs an e.g. of which (and not just saying this 'cause it's me own, but heck, this be a real dev.critter alright, and has i.e. mords, not to mention timestop and mestil's etc., which cleric's simply don't <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "255777", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Of course, all that won't do you much good if dev.crit is banned on your world, then again, you *could* do a spellsword w. the spell pen feats, but really, if going that route, then go Bard (20+ = lasting inspiration, what's not to love? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">       -OR- Cleric (if you can for e.g. get a Harm w. over 31 SR, then you gotta shot at PvP (just beware those self-healers, ie paladins and such; then, since you're going evil, probably best you go cleric for harm anyway --- cause pallys got smite, so be afraid, be very very afraid ... (since pallys got the fort to avoid dev.crit anyway (divine grace, add to equip't and well, they even avoid implosion, barring a roll of *1* of course, but harm on the other hand has no save, only takes into account spell resistance, the most of which is out there is i.e. a ring or what have you of 32; so, makes total sense then to go cleric as a spellsword in this sense... and yeah, there be a lot of 'em here, just check out that pulse, and hey, you know what they say, if you can take out a pally then your god/dess rejoices -- they'll name a holiday after you or something (since, heck, they know that *gulp* they're next <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">      <br><br>Happy Harming ~ Tyr<br>_________________<br>"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good [people] to do nothing" -- Edmund Burke, Philosopher and Politician (1729-1797)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 09/15/07 20:27</span></i></p>

Excellent info thanks all!  I agree the cleric can gain a nice advantage with their buff abilities; but I decided to stick with the Sorcerer/RDD/BG for the fun of a real "Monster".<br><br>I had to skip 4 attacks a round; though I may pull it off and just take Dev crit later on in the path...  I haven't finished tweaking yet so we will see <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>I went ahead and skipped out on the scythe as well so I could add in maximize.  Just didn't seem right not to have Maximize or empower (one or the other; or maybe both and drop extend?)<br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world
