Sweet buffed, there is no argment, and thank you for the post; love the wis slash symmatry, and to be sure, maybe I am into the whole AB thing (we know that I am, kinda addicted so wont get into it, yes ... other than to say, having done a ranger/pally w. Grimm, well ... <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "276571", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> I know, it's maybe about RP in which case won't dare say anything thus excusing AB ... seems you've nice AC though, (nice) but RP aside, we went offensive; that said, this is an interesting and nice addition to the guild; and I like it, for what it is so don't take me wrong, I do ...although you're relying (let's be honest) on a bit of equipt etc., should do a party good to bring you along pvm in terms of speed and saves and all, though I'm not sure what in this case what pally is doing for you on this spread aprart from div. grace, or monk 6 ... take it to 9 maybe, for the IE (since you're giving up Pal spells etc) or drop it down to one ... as in, the wis boost to ac and who can argue that .... on the other hand, not sure you're using your ranger to its potential (iel,26 is in most cases enough to add for e.g. all playable races, and often the optimum point, w. monk 9 for IE and pally if (I think that's great <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   for immunity etc., but up to you of course -- just some thoughts, and hope this makes sense --- btw, welcome tothe guild, and nice to meet you.

Thanks for the comments Tyr. I'll try to deliver a reply worthy of being an answer. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>---------------------------<br><br>I took the three classes with the specific intention of the following:<br><br>Ranger: Favored Enemies<br>Paladin: Divine Feats<br>Monk: Monk Attack Schedule<br><br>The whole build actually revolves around optimizing the Paladin Divine Feats, especially Divine Might. Divine Might lasts only for so many rounds, so how do I make full use of it? get Monk Attack Schedule. My AB suffers from going CHA intensive, what can I do? go Ranger, use Favored Enemy. Dualwielding only works on Light Armor. With such low DEX, what about AC? Get Divine Shield. <br><br>To a certain extent, the 3 classes support each other, going in full circle.<br><br>The first choice I played around with was Weaponmaster, but found out it just starved out the build featwise and it didn't give anything other than AB, so I went with Ranger, and took as much Ranger levels as possible to maximize the Favored Enemy bonus. 30 levels compared with 26 yields out 2 more Favored Enemies; That's 2 more races you get better AB with. I'd rather not drop that for Improved Evasion, since Evasion + Divine Grace already does a wonderful job. Plus, Improved Evasion won't help you with other saves.<br><br>AB is still workable even if self buffed only, but is of course very dependent on if the opponent is a Favored Enemy (which puts emphasis on the 2 more FE feats by going 30) <br><br><i>AB</i><br>35 Dual wielding<br>+2 Cat's Grace<br>+3 Blade Thirst<br>+7 Favored Enemy<br>+2 Bane of Enemies &lt;-- This one I forgot to include above<br>+1 Aid       <br>-----------------<br>50 AB (Dual wielding)<br><br><i>Damage</i> - self buffed only<br>1d6 Kama<br>+2 STR (+1 offhand)  &lt;-- build has 14 STR<br>+7 Divine Damage     &lt;-- Bypasses DR<br>+7 Favored Enemy<br>+2d6 Bane of Enemies<br>-----------------<br>19-34 Damage (-1 for offhand)<br><br>with 9 APR: 171-306 Damage/Round (63 is Divine)<br><br><i>AC</i><br>25 Base<br>+1 Mundane Studded Leather<br>+1 Cat's Grace<br>---------------------------<br>27 AC (29 if vs Evil, with Protection from Alignment)<br><br>Saves on OP were base saves. The following are the MAX saves, which is with +6 modifier in CON, DEX, WIS and CHA (Which really is probable only in a very high magic world):<br><br>Fortitude: 46<br>Will: 40<br>Reflex: 42<br><br>All those numbers on the original post were simply put up to show maximum potential, not the standard operating potential. <br><br>The build isn't equipment dependent; it's already good and does fine all by itself. In fact, since it's already effective and boosting nearly every stat makes it even stronger, you become <b>adaptive</b>, able to utilize a great lot of items that come your way (except INT booster only) which is a great convenience especially in a PW. You can even use Heavy Armor, and though you can't dualwield, you can use a long bow instead. You do have considerable DEX, and FE and Divine Might is always there to help out.  <br><br>This is where the RP premise came in. <br><br>"The Law of Nature - Survival of the fittest". Surviving in nature requires that you know how to utilize nature and what she gives you. With this build, a character can do that. He doesn't have to sell that CHA boosting item, since he can use it. The same goes for every other stat, or maybe equipment, with the exception of course of INT boosting items. Even other weapons yield good results, though of course not as effective as a kama.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By basuraman on 12/01/07 21:12</span></i></p>

I didn't comment on this build, so I will now.<br><br>Firstly, I think that AB is too low for a meleer. Furthermore, you have don't have many ways to increase it, barring magic items. Yes, your saves are great, your HPs are decent and your damage is pretty good, but you'll struggle to hit anything.<br><br>I agree with TyrTemplar, with magic items you'll significantly increase your AC, AB, damage and saves, but you have to get that +12 gear, and that's not possible in a lot of environments.
