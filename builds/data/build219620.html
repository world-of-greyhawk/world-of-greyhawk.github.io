Introduction:<br>I happened to hit jjellison's <i>Judge Singer</i> build with Pulse Cap's search engine, and found the build interesting. I think, however, that Smiting is very limited in its usefulness. This is why I don't like using it, nor building around it. I made a more standard Divine Warrior type character, which I found very fun to play and <b>extremely</b> powerful with<br><br>Bard Song<br>Curse Song<br>Divine Might<br>Divine Shield<br>Divine Wrath (once per day)<br>Taunt<br>+ couple of Bard buffs.

I truly believe (AND KNOW) that Smites can be worth it especially after your taunt, but I also agree that a paladin build might be just as good without it. Whats so good about the CHA buffs, divine shield/might, and the bard song is that they cannot be dispelled. Divine wrath cannot be dispelled either. But it doesn't really last to long.<br><br>You should mention that you get 8 uses of turn undead pr day. You can switch two CoT levels for Pre Epic Paladin and then switch one pre-epic feat for Extra turning. Could be useful.<br><br>Nice powerful self-buffer, with a few totally undispellable buffs.

Interesting build.  Alignment shifting can be an issue for some people, especially because it's usually pretty hard to change alignment on the law/chaos axis.<br><br>The end result is quite nice though, with very workable AB and AC, good buffing and great saves.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Like Grimnir, I like Extra Smiting in a Heavy CoT build which actually utilizes Charisma.  You get quite a lot for that investment: +5 to hit, +20Damage, which is divine damage.
