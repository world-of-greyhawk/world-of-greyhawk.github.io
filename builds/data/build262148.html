This is basically a build that takes advantage of the 16th Bard level song, the 10 SD levels required for Epic Dodge, and the nice bonus feats from Fighter.  <br><br>It did well in melee, and was nearly unbeatable by the typical strength based WM when buffed, and still won 7/10 unbuffed (singing after the start/shadow evade.)

I'd trade 4 levels of Fighter for 4 of Bard, then drop Epic Fortitude and a pair Great Dex feats and pick up Lasting Inspiration.  Bard/Curse Song lasting 10 times longer is invaluable.

I'd consider it, but can normally beat most but dexxers before the song ends - and my AC was high enough that singing those extra times didn't give them any chance to hit me, for the most part.  Granted, Lasting Inspiration is great for partying.<br><br>That said, I'll likely mess around with that suggestion, and see if I can come up with good enough AB/AC still.

If you're so concerned about your Fort save then change race for Halfing and drop STR (or even maybe INT) for CON.<br><br>You get 20% XP penalty at most levels btw, but you can't get rid of it in epic levels since you try to get Epic Dodge soon.<br><br>Interesting, it seems preety nice, although it doesn't fits in my brain to consider that as a good damage output.
