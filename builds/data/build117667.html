Stunning fist the opponent (dc 35 at 40th level), knock him down with improved knockdown (since he's stunned it's a lot easier), then quivering palm (fortitude dc 29). if that doesn't work, repeat the stunning fist/knockdown untill it dies.<br>29/26/23/20/17<br>1-20 + 4 (20/x2)<br>_________________<br>Save yourself some arm strain.
