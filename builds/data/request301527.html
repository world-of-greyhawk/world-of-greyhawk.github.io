I've got a build concept that could use a bit of help. I'm thinking of a wizard that can find enemy sneaks and neutralize them. Environment: Mid-magic (very limited immunities, no permahaste, +1 per 5 levels); max power for level 30 please, and at least competent throughout, because I could be hunted at any time. True Sight is Seeinvis+Ultravision+spot bonus. 5 lvls of any prestige class, 3 of any base class by lvl 30.<br><br>I've got a pretty standard human 32 wizard/8 rogue that would be serviceable at this in mind. But I'm looking for something non-standard to it. This build was reliant on his invisibility spells to facilitate stealth, since he'll never outsneak a rogue or monk. The goal is to be able to find enemy mage-killers and get them first. <br><br>Thanks for any help in advance. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

For a sneak-hunter wizard, perhaps you want to invest 10 levels in Pale master for the immunity to critical hits and sneak attacks.<br>_________________<br>Great Research Tools:<br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWNWiki</a><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">NWN Epic Character Build Search Engine</a><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/" target="_blank">The NWN Vault</a>

The down fall is you won’t be able to use 8th or 9th circle spells until pass level 21 and you won’t have any accuses to epic spells. The up side Pale Masters make assassins squirm and being able to detect them through their steps is very helpful unless they completely focus gear in hide/move silently you still have about a 50/50 chance of detection. This can be changed out with spot which depending on gear available might be better but you will be able to listen to invisible people all the time with out them having knowledge of the detection and depending how much spot check you get from true sight on sneaks. I most likely don’t need to tell you this but owl’s wisdom is very helpful.<br><br>For rogues focus on Necromancy since their evasion isn’t worth squat and plus their low fortitude saves make them easy to pick off or throw Bigby’s their way bards will normally be about the same aside from maybe the RDD which wail will still work. This also works against fighters as well since most don’t think about buffing their Fortitude Saves up so nerco-spells can kill most right away if that doesn’t work try to lower their Strength and use the next tactic. Against magic resistant monks use undead touch or combo with Premonition, Death Armor, Elemental Shield, Acid Sheath and Tenser’s Transformation. Clerics and Druids are treated about the same since they have death ward and some spell resistance; Mordenkainen’s Disjunction then Wail of the Banshee hope you get them first especially against clerics. Against Wizards and Sorcerers hope you get your spell gets off first since most fights between these guys they have more spells and just about as high or higher DC to spells; Mordenkainen’s to strip away any spell mantles, hit with a Bigby’s Forceful Hand. Against Paladin’s well you’re in for a fight depending on the build which you won’t know until he comes in to hit you he might have super high saves which then Bigby’s might be your answer or you’ll be stuck with having to fight someone able to penetrate stone skin dispel you and all around be your biggest pain in the butt. Next on the biggest pains are the rangers which if built right can’t be detected by sight regardless of focus to spot with their Camouflage and One with the Land place in a little bit of shadow dancer you’ll wish you had listen aside from that treat like rogues with their saves. Against all your largest fear will be knock downs and magic.<br><br><b>Wizard(17), Pale Master(10), Rogue(3), Elf </b><br><br><b>Ability Points <i>(ending)</i></b><br>STR   12<br>DEX   16<br>CON   10   <br>WIS   14<br>INT   16 (26)<br>CHA    8<br><br><b>Basic Status</b><br>Hitpoints: 194<br>Skillpoints: 240<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 14/20/16<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8<br>BAB: 15<br>AB (max, naked): 16 (melee), 18 (ranged)<br>AC (naked): 25<br>Spell Casting: Wizard(9)<br><br><b>Skills</b><br>Appraise 13(21) &lt;-- optional<br>Concentration 33(33)<br>Disable Trap 32(40)<br>Listen 32(51) &lt;-- optional spot<br>Spellcraft 33(41)<br>Search 32(40)<br>Tumble 30(33)<br>UMD 32(31)<br><br><b>LEVELING GUIDE<br>Character Level- Class (Class level): Feats</b><br>01: Wizard(1): Spell Focus: Necromancy, {Scribe Scroll}<br>02: Wizard(2)<br>03: Wizard(3): Greater Spell Focus: Necromancy<br>04: Pale Master(1): INT+1, (INT=17)<br>05: Wizard(4)<br>06: Pale Master(2): Skill Focus: Listen/Spot<br>07: Rogue(1)<br>08: Pale Master(3): INT+1, {Darkvision}, (INT=18)<br>09: Wizard(5): Alertness, Extend Spell<br>10: Pale Master(4)<br>11: Wizard(6)<br>12: Pale Master(5): INT+1, Silent Spell, (INT=19)<br>13: Wizard(7)<br>14: Pale Master(6)<br>15: Wizard(8): Empower Spell<br>16: Pale Master(7): INT+1, (INT=20)<br>17: Rogue(2): {Evasion}<br>18: Pale Master(8): Maximize Spell<br>19: Pale Master(9)<br>20: Pale Master(10): INT+1, (INT=21)<br>21: Wizard(9): Great Intelligence I, (INT=22)<br>22: Wizard(10): Great Intelligence II, (INT=23)<br>23: Wizard(11)<br>24: Wizard(12): INT+1, Great Intelligence III, (INT=25)<br>25: Wizard(13)<br>26: Wizard(14)<br>27: Wizard(15): Toughness, Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy<br>28: Wizard(16): INT+1, (INT=26)<br>29: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>30: Wizard(17): Epic Skill Focus: Listen/Spot<br> <br><b>Skill Points</b><br>01: Concentration(4), Spellcraft(4), Save(12), <br>02: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(15), <br>03: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(18), <br>04: Concentration(1), Listen/Spot(7), Spellcraft(1), Save(14), <br>05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(17), <br>06: Concentration(1), Listen/Spot(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(18), <br>07: Appraise(5), Listen/Spot (1), Tumble(10), UMD(10), Save(3), <br>08: Concentration(2), Listen/Spot (1), Spellcraft(2), Save(4), <br>09: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(8), <br>10: Concentration(1), Listen/Spot (2), Spellcraft(1), Save(10), <br>11: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(14), <br>12: Concentration(1), Listen/Spot (2), Spellcraft(1), Save(16), <br>13: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(20), <br>14: Concentration(1), Listen/Spot (2), Spellcraft(1), Save(22), <br>15: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(26), <br>16: Concentration(1), Listen/Spot (2), Spellcraft(1), Save(29), <br>17: Disable Trap(20), Listen/Spot(1), Tumble(10), UMD(10), Save(1), <br>18: Concentration(2), Listen/Spot(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(3), <br>19: Concentration(1), Listen/Spot (1), Spellcraft(1), Save(7), <br>20: Concentration(1), Listen/Spot (1), Spellcraft(1), Save(11), <br>21: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(16), <br>22: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(22), <br>23: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(28), <br>24: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(35), <br>25: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(42), <br>26: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(49), <br>27: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(56), <br>28: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(64), <br>29: Appraise(5), Disable Trap(12), Listen/Spot (9), Search(32), Tumble(10), UMD(12), <br>30: Appraise(3), Concentration(2), Spellcraft(2),<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By VectorZulu on 09/23/08 02:20</span></i></p>

Sounds good. The spell resistance issue would be a pain, since the mage-hunters have the only monks on the server in their number. But if they can't hurt me either, sooner or later I'd find a spell for them. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   I'd have to be careful about the Palemaster thing since showing boney arms is frowned on. hehe But it works.<br><br>Oh...1 thing I forgot the mention. The world uses CNR, so those crafting skills and feats would be better spent elsewhere, since all those things can be made IG and 'gain' xp instead of lose them.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By RangerSG on 09/23/08 11:03</span></i></p>

Wizard25 druid5 shifter10 has unnerfed trueseeing, unlimited icestorms (no reflex) and dispels. I think there is one in the index like this already. <br><br>Another option is Kyriani Agrivar's All-Seeing Phae build, an elven zen-archer with massive spot, listen and active search. Mostly cleric too, so you can unleash those nasty high-fort save destruction spells.

How about a Cleric build? Wis-based, with Trickery domain for Imp Invis, pump Spot so that with TS plus your high Wis you will spot almost anything. You will be invisible to them, but able to spot them. Implosion DC will be plenty high to take advantage of low Fort saves.<br><br>TM
