First things first, I hate alignment changes, and even more if there's so little RP justification like in this build. I mean, yes, maybe a change from evil to neutral and from BG to CoT isn't so drastic, but the slope gets slippier when it's done backwards also. It has two alignment changes, one at level 17 from evil to neutral and at level 28 from neutral to evil. <br>That apart, I felt that this build deserved its post, so I decided to go for it.<br><br>I got inspiration from GD's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "209844", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Shrike</a>, although his uses Fighter instead of CoT and more BG. After looking at his build I tried different combinations with BG and Bard, and this one seems the best I could come up with. There's only one similar build in the search engine, I...Samphus' <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "253927", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Angel of Redemption (Bard 26/BG 4/CoT 10)</a>, but the class split is different as well as the nature of the build. <br><br>The aim of this build is a meleer with decent saves, spell potential and the ability to be useful in party environment. To achieve this, 16 levels of Bard were taken, in order to get an excellent Bard Song and some much needed spells. This, in conjunction with BG summons (namely the Epic Vrock) results in a fearsome warrior with useful backup.<br>AB is ok, but buffable with spells and stacking Bull's Strength. AC is not excellent (I'm still getting used to epic numbers), but Improved Invisibility and UMD should make up for it. Saves are nice for a meleer and even better against spells, and this character has a wide array of tricks to play with. Also, Taunt will help with high AC enemies, should he run into some of these.<br>So here he is:<br><br>Divine Traitor (playable 1-40 PvM) <br>Human Bard 16/CoT 8/BG 16<br><br><b>Abilities</b><br>STR 16 (30)<br>DEX 8<br>CON 14<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 16 (16)<br><br><b>Level progression</b><br>01: Bard(1): Blind Fight, Curse Song<br>02: Bard(2)<br>03: Bard(3): Power Attack<br>04: Bard(4): CHA+1, (CHA=16)<br>05: Bard(5)<br>06: Bard(6): Cleave<br>07: Bard(7)<br>08: Bard(8): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>09: Blackguard(1): Still Spell<br>10: Blackguard(2): {Smite Good}<br>11: Blackguard(3)<br>12: Blackguard(4): STR+1, Improved Critical, (STR=18)<br>13: Blackguard(5)<br>14: Blackguard(6)<br>15: Blackguard(7): Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>16: Blackguard(8): STR+1, (STR=19)<br>17: Champion of Torm(1): *Alignment Change*<br>18: Champion of Torm(2): Toughness, Knockdown<br>19: Champion of Torm(3): {Smite Evil}<br>20: Champion of Torm(4): STR+1, Improved Knockdown, (STR=20)<br>21: Champion of Torm(5): Great Strength I, (STR=21)<br>22: Bard(9)<br>23: Champion of Torm(6): Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>24: Champion of Torm(7): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=23)<br>25: Champion of Torm(8): Epic Prowess<br>26: Bard(10)<br>27: Bard(11): Lingering Song<br>28: Blackguard(9): STR+1, (STR=24), *Alignment Change*<br>29: Blackguard(10)<br>30: Blackguard(11): Great Strength III, (STR=25)<br>31: Blackguard(12)<br>32: Bard(12): STR+1, (STR=26)<br>33: Blackguard(13): Epic Skill Focus: Taunt, Armor Skin<br>34: Blackguard(14)<br>35: Blackguard(15)<br>36: Blackguard(16): STR+1, Great Strength IV, Epic Fiendish Servant, (STR=28)<br>37: Bard(13)<br>38: Bard(14)<br>39: Bard(15): Great Strength V, (STR=29)<br>40: Bard(16): STR+1, (STR=30)<br><br><b>Skills</b> - 253 skill points<br>Discipline 43(53)<br>Hide 5(4)<br>Perform 33(36)<br>Spellcraft 43(45)<br>Tumble 43(42)<br>Taunt 43(56)<br>UMD 43(46)<br><br><b>Vitals</b><br>HP: 456 (max.)<br>BAB: 28<br>AB: +42/+37/+32/+27<br>AC: 27 (full plate)<br><br><b>Buffed vitals</b><br>AB: 42 +2Song +5GMW +2Bull's +5Curse Song +6Taunt= 62<br>AC: 27 +5Song +2Curse Song +4Mage armor= 36<br>HP: 456 +20Song= 476<br>Damage: Base damage +3Song +5GMW +2Warcry +18STR(Bull's) +5d6 Sneak Attack= Base damage +28 +5d6 Sneak Attack<br><br><b>Saves</b> (vs. spells)<br>Fortitude 31 (40)<br>Reflex 28 (37)<br>Will 25 (34)<br><br><b>Special abilities</b> (worth noting)<br>Bard Song and Curse Song: increases AB +2, damage +3, Fort +2, Will +3, Reflex +2, HP +20, AC +5, skills +4 and the opposite to enemies.<br>BG Bull's Strength (stacks with normal Bull's)<br>Dark Blessing: increases saves by 3<br>5d6 Sneak Attack<br>Epic Vrock<br>56 Taunt (60 with Bard Song)<br>Improved Knockdown<br>Bard spellcasting: up to level 5, level 6 spells would require +6 CHA<br>Divine Wrath<br>Turn Undead<br><br>I know many have issues with taking pre-Epic feats in Epic, so you may swap around some feats and ability points in order to drop Lingering Song.<br><br>Any input or suggestions are welcome.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By rafa10pj on 10/30/07 11:34</span></i></p>
