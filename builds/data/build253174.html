Master Pale Defender (Dwarven Defender(6), Bard(4), Pale Master(30), Dwarf)<br><br>It may be breaking some long scared rule not to go at least 10 dwarven defender, (Grizz, forgive me!) but please hear me out.  This build was not found in the epic builder’s library.  Matter of fact, nothing close was found.  I wanted a unique 30th level PM build and decided a bard/DD mix would do the trick.  (Wizard/DD could also be considered for the extra Int/skill points)  Six levels of DD provide defensive stance, defensive awareness II, and ultimately 12 DR with epic feats.  This combined with high PM armor class, Epic Mage Armor, Epic Warding, several epic energy resistances, this adds up to a pretty untouchable critter.  I admit, this has not been play tested, (spank me) but with mundane items, it boasts a pretty impressive AC.  Only weakness is low AB.  <br><br>Feedback, as always, appreciated.  <br><br>STR: 14 (20)<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 18 (22)<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 10<br>CHA: 12<br><br>Hitpoints: 594<br>Skillpoints: 100<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 29/25/21<br>BAB: 24<br>AB (max, naked): 32 (melee), 26 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 32/42<br>Spell Casting: Bard(2)<br><br>Heal 43(42), Spellcraft 40(40), Tumble 10(12), UMD 6(7)<br><br>01: Bard(1):  Toughness<br>02: Bard(2)<br>03: Bard(3): Dodge  <br>04: Pale Master(1): CON+1, (CON=19)<br>05: Pale Master(2)<br>06: Pale Master(3): Weapon Focus<br>07: Pale Master(4)<br>08: Pale Master(5): CON+1, (CON=20)<br>09: Pale Master(6): Power Attack<br>10: Pale Master(7)<br>11: Pale Master(8)<br>12: Pale Master(9): CON+1, Cleave, (CON=21)<br>13: Pale Master(10)<br>14: Dwarven Defender(1): DD: (Defensive Stance)<br>15: Dwarven Defender(2): Improved Critical<br>16: Dwarven Defender(3): CON+1, (CON=22)<br>17: Dwarven Defender(4)<br>18: Dwarven Defender(5): Blind Fight<br>19: Dwarven Defender(6)<br>20: Bard(4): STR+1, (STR=15)<br>21: Pale Master(11): Epic Damage Reduction I<br>22: Pale Master(12)<br>23: Pale Master(13): Epic Energy Resistance: Electricity I<br>24: Pale Master(14): STR+1, Epic Damage Reduction II,  (STR=16)<br>25: Pale Master(15)<br>26: Pale Master(16): Epic Energy Resistance: Electricity II<br>27: Pale Master(17): Epic Damage Reduction III<br>28: Pale Master(18): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>29: Pale Master(19): Epic Energy Resistance: Cold I<br>30: Pale Master(20): Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor<br>31: Pale Master(21)<br>32: Pale Master(22): STR+1, Epic Energy Resistance: Cold II, (STR=18)<br>33: Pale Master(23): Epic Weapon Focus<br>34: Pale Master(24)<br>35: Pale Master(25): Epic Spell: Epic Warding<br>36: Pale Master(26): STR+1, Armor Skin, (STR=19)<br>37: Pale Master(27):  <br>38: Pale Master(28): Epic Energy Resistance: Sonic I<br>39: Pale Master(29): Epic Spell: Greater Ruin<br>40: Pale Master(30): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>_________________<br>TeoDeathDealer<br>Member of SoulForge PW (Action)

Opps, forgot to mention this build requires an alignment change at 13th.  If you want to avoid that, take Wiz/Sorc instead.

A nice variation of the Undead Lord. Pretty sure DD6 doesn't do much for you, though. 3 DR? With a 32 AB and +5 damage from strength, this character isn't just untouchable, it is untouching too. Yes, fighter has been done before, but it would make this character stronger. Defensive awareness isn't necessary for a build with this much AC and sneak immunity.<br><br>Out of curiosity, where do you get offense? You put everything into UMD?<br><br>Make no mistakes, defensively it is as you say very good and hard to kill, much DR with a nice amount of hitpoints. but a bit higher focus towards BAB and offensive feats should do you good.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

This build seems to work better with Wizard 4/Dwarven Defender 6/Pale Master 30.  I would also recommend different starting stats:<br>Str 8, Dex 12, Con 16, Wis 8, Int 18, Cha 6<br><br>Take toughness at level 1, boost Dex to 13 at level 4, and take Dodge at level 6. At level 8, boost Int to 19.  <br><br>From there, everything else is going into Constitution (you can get to 26 with normal boosts, or you can sacrifice some Resistance feats to get even more Constitution.<br><br>Depending on the PW you play at, your major offense is going to be coming from summons, Greater Ruin, and Hellball.  Your Demi Lich summons can cast a Greater Ruin and is a level 21 Wizard (it even has decent damage reduction and one use of Harm Self to heal up).  If your server's monsters are made too strong for summons to do well (seems like most are like this), you're going to run into problems with this build (unless you're just the party tank).  If that's your goal, I'd make sure you take NO POINTS IN TUMBLE.  This allows you to force an attack of opportunity against yourself from moving in combat, which could save a party member should your opponent try to switch targets.  Remember, you're not taking much damage at all.<br><br>If your server has high magic and the monsters (or PvP players) have access to all sorts of items, you might want to tweak this build idea to Pale Master 25/Wizard 5/Dwarven Defender 10.  You will only have the Lich Lord summon and lose out on your PM 28 feat, but you gain a Wizard feat and if you take that 5th Wizard level later in your Epic progression you can learn Timestop and Mord's (or whatever you choose) to open things up a bit more.  The added DD levels obviously help you defend against the high Strength builds (bonus damage).  If you can get ahold of some DR items, the highest version you're wearing will stack with your innate DR (even Aurumvorox armor and a brawler's belt will do wonders with this build).  Your only real bane will wind up being magical and divine damage.<br><br>If summons are completely useless on the server you play at, chances really are that this build isn't going to work well for you unless you're the party tank.  In that case, you can still use this general theme (Crit immunity, DR, and resistances) by using PM 24/Wiz 10/DD 6...  It'll be sacrificing the epic spells in favor of a few more caster levels so you can use (minimally effective) acid sheath, elemental armor, and IGMS.  But at that point, I'd say you should probably look for a different build to use.

I forget, what was the barbarian DR progression? Could that be a slightly more tidy way to get DR before the palemaster levels without having to spend ability score points and a feat on dodge? That would be an entire other build though.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">

Barbarian DR progression is fairly low, they get DR 1/- at level 11 and +1 every 3 levels after that, against Dwarven Defenders who get DR 3/- at level 6 and +3 every 4 levels after that, plus, Barbarians don't get Defensive Awareness, so it's not a viable choice if DR is what you're seeking.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
