I've been playin NWN since it came out, yet I havn't managed a great build. Thought I'd ask the pro builders.<br><br>a character that's hard to hit, can take a hit if hit, and can deal seriou damage when they hit.<br><br>Think this is possible?<br><br>And I'm wonderin if it's possible to build a spellcaster class up with ALOT of points in SC, without sing gear, for a RP server I've been playing on.<br><br><br>Thanks alot.<br>Xtech-- signing off

Darn, lol, that makes a lot of more sense. Hmmmm, as a matter of fact, a lot of classes have spellcraft as class skill, it should be no problem.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 08/24/06 01:58</span></i></p>

Spellcasting classes have Spellcraft as as class skill, so you should easily be able to max it at 43 ranks by level 40. If you go with a high INT build (i.e. WIZ), you'll have a good modifer to it as well. Throw in Epic Skill Focus:Scellcraft for a +10 boost and you can easily get a modified score of 65 or more without any magic or items.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I am compelled to ask, why is it that you want such high Spellcraft? Is it for the saves against spells? That makes sense, if you are going Melee. But Cinn suggested going Wizard... meaning, heavy caster. If it is caster that you go, I would think that a Sorc/Paladin or Sorc/Blackgaurd would have better saves. They could get great spellcraft as well. Probably 10 less, as their modifier would be about that much lower, but they could get the Epic Feat and max out the skill, which would only increase to the incredible saves. The Exalted Sorceress would be the absolute best in this case, as it always has been.<br><br>As for Melee, a Bard/PM/RDD might be what you want. You could get good Spellcraft with high Melee presence, tons of immunities, good damage output, and many bonuses to your AC.
