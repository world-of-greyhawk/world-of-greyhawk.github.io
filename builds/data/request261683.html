So I was looking over Thaxll's Stunning Claw (props to him for inspiring this build) and attempted to do what a few suggested, which was more monk, and came up with the following.  <br><br>Race: Elf<br><br>Druid 16/Monk 14/Champion of Torm 10<br><br><br><br>Starting Stats<br><br><br>Str: 08 <br><br>Dex: 18<br><br>Con: 08<br><br>Int: 10<br><br>Wis: 18<br><br>Cha: 08<br><br><br>Ending Stats<br><br><br>Str: 08<br><br>Dex: 20<br><br>Con: 08<br><br>Int: 10<br><br>Wis: 30<br><br>Cha: 08<br><br><br>Basically I bumped dex 1st and last and everything else went into wisdom.<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>1 - Druid(1) Extend Spell<br><br>2 - Monk(2)<br><br>3 - Druid(2) Weapon Finesse<br><br>4 - Monk(2) <br>5 - Druid(3)<br><br>6 - Monk(3)  Weapon Focus (kama)<br><br>7 - Druid(4) <br>8 - Monk(4)<br><br>9 - Druid(5) Extra Stunning Attacks<br><br>10 - Monk(5)<br><br>11 - Monk(6)<br><br>12 - Druid(6) Improved Critical (unarmed strike)<br><br>13 - Monk(7)<br><br>14 - Monk(8)<br><br>15 - Druid(7) Toughness<br><br>16 - Druid(8)<br><br>17 - Druid(9)<br><br>18 - Druid(10) Great Fortitude<br><br>19 - Druid(11)<br><br>20 - Champion of Torm(1)<br><br>21 - Champion of Torm(2) Great Wisdom I &amp; Great Wisdom II<br><br>22 - Druid(12)<br><br>23 - Champion of Torm(3)<br><br>24 - Champion of Torm(4) Great Wisdom III &amp; Great Wisdom IV<br><br>25 - Champion of Torm(5)<br><br>26 - Druid(13)<br><br>27 - Monk(9) Improved Stunning Fist I<br><br>28 - Druid(14)<br><br>29 - Champion of Torm(6) Improved Stunning Fist II<br><br>30 - Champion of Torm(7) Improved Stunning Fist III<br><br>31 - Monk(10)<br><br>32 - Champion of Torm(8) Improved Stunning Fist IV<br><br>33 - Champion of Torm(9) Improved Stunning Fist V<br><br>34 - Monk(11)<br>35 - Druid(15)<br>36 - Champion of Torm(10) Improved Stunning Fist VI &amp; Improved Stunning Fist VII<br><br>37 - Monk(12)<br><br>38 - Monk(13)<br><br>39 - Druid (16) Dragon Shape<br><br>40 - Monk(14)<br><br>BAB 25<br>AB 30/27//24/21/18 (44/41/38/35/32 when shifted)<br>AC 35 (63 when shifted)<br><br>Fort:  31<br>Reflex:  31<br>Will:  38<br><br>HP 250 and 830 when shifted<br><br>Gets a DC 54 stunning fist. 58 with owls insight 59 with a +10 Periapt of wisdom, 60 with both<br><br>and becuase of the monk levels, he now sits with 17 Stunning fists.  <br><br>Unfortunately AB still stinks, which is why I'm going to ask if there is anything anyone can see where I can pick this up any and if so, how?

Hmm, you're missing two initial status points If I'm correct.<br><br>Weapon Finesse? I never thought of it, might help you level up starting epics, nice idea, since the bear shift loses a lot of power when dealing magical weapons and DRs.<br><br>Well, AB is a hard thing to boost on a dragon, Kail Pendragon is the best dragon builder in the guild, you could ask him, in this case Divine Wrath is the closest AB boost you get, so you might want to boost Charisma, in any case you'll need buffs for your AB. Use your own Bull's Strength, Extended Blood Frenzy and Extended Aura of Vitality for STR boost, if you change something for Empower Spell empowering Bull's Strength and the rest extended will cap your STR, which will increase AB and damage, but other than that, you'd need either more buffs (Bard or Cleric, but you've got no space where to place them) or high BAB class pre-epic, but CoT has to be taken epic here for the epic feats. If you ask me, that's the price to pay for ridiculously high Stunning Fist DC, you just can be perfect, almost any other aproach for this crazy DC leaves the AB and AC much below.<br><br>Heh, you reminded me with this topic that I forgot I was going to post changes to my build to use Divine Wrath, thanks mate.

True enough about the buffs.  Even buffed, this really seemed to lack.  <br><br>I suppose at worst, this could end up being fairly decent in a party where you can tank some while stunning as someone else put it...there's not a lot out there that's going to make that save.  <br><br>On the upside, at least you have 17 stuns now <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

17 stuns are almost double of what my build has, sure that's handy, good work. I've updated my <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "238749", "0", "#1861417", ' target="_blank"');</script>Stunning Claw</a> with the changes needed to use Divine Wrath, you might want to check it out.
