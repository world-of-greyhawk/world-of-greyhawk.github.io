I have this idea about making this paladin 25 Harper scout 5 / wizard 10 with dev crit on this PW i play on, but have no clue how to allocate the stats, nor the feats for maximum AB and AC, could some of you epicly experienced builders give me  some pointers, so i wont fumble too much?

Maybe it's just me, but I don't quite get this build.  Why do a Paladin/Wizard?  If you did a Paladin/Sorc you would get a double benefit from raising Charisma; you would get better saves, and your spells would be more effective (also more spells per day).  <br><br>I suppose the Harper Scout could be useful because of the fact that their buffs stack, but other than that they seem kind of worthless.  They require 2 feats that I wouldn't otherwise take (Alertness and Iron Will), and it takes 5 levels away from another class that could potentially give you more useful abilities.  Just checked the index of builds, and I must say there aren't very many Harper builds, so there must be a reason.  <br><br>If you want a stronger build I would probably recommend something like Paladin/Sorc/RDD, Paladin/Fighter/Sorc, or even Rogue/Paladin/Sorc or Cleric/Paladin/Sorc. <br><br>Still, if you insist on doing a Paladin/Wizard/Harper I shall attempt to oblige:<br><br>Paladin 23/Wizard 12/Harper Scout 5<br>(Pre-epic Paladin 20)<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 14<br>Dex  8<br>Con 14<br>Int 14<br>Wis 14<br>Cha 14<br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 26<br>Dex  8<br>Con 14<br>Int 16<br>Wis 14<br>Cha 14<br><br>2 points into Int, 8 points into Str<br><br>Feats<br><br>1 Power Attack, Cleave<br>3 Toughness<br>6 Weapon Focus<br>9 Alertness (Harper pre-req)<br>12 Iron Will (Harper pre-req)<br>15 Improved Critical<br>18 Great Cleave<br>21 Epic Weapon Focus, Harper Knowledge, Favored Enemy<br>24 Great Str I<br>25 Wizard: Still Spell<br>27 Great Str II<br>30 Great Str III<br>31 Wizard: Craft Wand<br>33 Great Str IV, Harper: Deneir’s Eye<br>36 Overwhelming Critical, Paladin: Devastating Critical<br>38 Harper: Tymora’s Smile<br>39 Armor Skin, Harper: Favored Enemy, Harper: Lliira’s Heart<br>40 Craft Harper Item<br><br>Level Progression:<br><br>1-20  Paladin<br>21    Harper<br>22-32 Wizard<br>33    Harper<br>34-36 Paladin<br>37    Wizard<br>38-40 Harper   <br><br>Anyway, that's about what your build would look like.  You can feel free to change the leveling progression if you want to, but be aware that if you add levels of Wizard or Harper pre-epic (before level 21) it will water down your AB.  Check the AB table at the back of the manual if you want more info on how this works.  <br><br>Also note that you will want to make sure to take a level of Wizard and Harper late in the build (lvl 37 or later) in order to max out your bonuses from Spellcraft and Tumble, respectively.

The reason of taking harper is that, when you take him on epic levels, at levels 1 and 5 you can take Great Dexterity or Great Charisma instead of their usual favored enemy. That makes them pretty powerful.
