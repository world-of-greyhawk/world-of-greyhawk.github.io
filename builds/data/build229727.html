<b>Walks the angry, dirty path fun and good 1-40, PvM.</b><br><br>A woman, a former trell, so abused, so downtrodden, so alone she sold her virginity to the Æsir Loki in trade for power. He is the Nightgod, the god of tricksters. This trade brought the woman a child, a son.<br><br>On one of his journeys upon Middle-Earth to see that all was well with man, Thor had a communion with a mortal woman. Thor is the God of thunder and fertility. He is also the god of warfare, of wild and berserker combat. This communion also brought a child upon Middle-Earth, a fiery daughter. <br><br>In their grown days, these childs met, and even this meeting brought a child to the world. The legend about this Half-Æsir grew. Tales wandering among man said that this young man was shorter than a woman, and was a trickster like Loki. He could duck even the swiftest blow, and was silent and unseen like the darkest night. His fury was from Thor they said, as was his ability to shrug off injuries and withstand massive injuries in combat.<br><br>So says the tales man spin, but who was he really, this Half Aesir? Sit down and listen, all will be revealed.<br>___<br>I like Norse myths and spin another build around the topic.<br>I never make dexers that aren't rogue's, this is an attempt at creating an rp build that both has Epic dodge and DR plus good hp's.<br>This build from Grizzled Dwarflord has the same classes. <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "201265", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Dwarf, NG, any non-lawful.<br><br>STR 12<br>DEX 16(26)<br>CON 18(22)<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 6<br><br>1:Rog1: Ambidexterity<br>2:Barb1:<br>3:Barb2: Weapon finesse<br>4:Rog2: CON(19)<br>5:Rog3:<br>6:Barb3: 2-Weapon Fighting<br>7:Barb4:<br>8:Rog4: CON(20)<br>9:Rog5: KDown<br>10:Barb5:<br>11:Barb6:<br>12:Rog6: Imp 2w Fighting; CON(21)<br>13:Rog7:<br>14:Barb7:<br>15:Barb8: WF: Handaxe<br>16:Rog8: DEX(17)<br>17:Rog9:<br>18:Barb9: Blind Fight<br>19:Barb10:<br>20:Rog10: Improved Evasion; DEX(18)<br>21:Fgtr1: GrDEX I(19); EDR I<br>22:Fgtr2: EDR II<br>23:Fgtr3:<br>24:Fgtr4: GrDEX II(21); EDR III; DEX(20)<br>25:Rog11:<br>26:Barb11:<br>27:Barb12: EWF: Handaxe<br>28:Rog12: DEX(22)<br>29:Rog13: Defensive roll<br>30:Barb13: GrDEX III(23)<br>31:Barb14:<br>32:Rog14: DEX(24)<br>33:Rog15: GrDEX IV(25)<br>34:Barb15:<br>35:Rog16: Epic Dodge<br>36:Barb16: Epic Prowess; DEX(26)<br>37:Rog17:<br>38:Barb17:<br>39:Rog18: Armor skin<br>40:Rog19: Crippling Strike; CON(22)<br><br>hp: 598, 678 in rage( <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    )<br>DR: 12/-<br><br>AC, naked 28, + shield 31, subtract 2 in rage.<br><br>AB, mundane handaxe<br>39/34/29/24.

He can wear medium armour and board early in his career if necessary, which should make living easier. You have UMD and trap setting to help dish damage, your trap setting are high enough to let you set Deadly traps in combat.<br><br>Ab is a bit low, but doable, especially when you catch them flat-footed. Another weakness, and this is THE weakness, is his will save. It is so low I didn't even bother to help it, you really need to get some defense for it.<br>That's it for now.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 02/08/06 01:26</span></i></p>

Well done, an epic dodger with DR and a nice amount of HPs. Not someone to make angry at you or to meet in some dark alley... or dark northern forest (especially if the darkness is not natural <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> ).<br>Pity you didn't squeeze in TR, it's so nice to cut them down and drain their strength while they are all covering in the corner scared like babies <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> <br><br>Kudos<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Heja Norge! Nice work, I like it. However, like Kail says, Terrifying Rage would be a nice feature <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>Fanget av begravelsen<br>pines vi av guds godhet<br>ingen flammer, intet hat<br>de hadde rett vi kom til Helvete... <br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.burzum.org" target="_blank">Burzum</a> - Hvis Lyset Tar Oss

Thanks for good feedback, but about terrifying Rage.....<br><br>*bangs head to wall again*<br><br>I thought you needed high STR for all the Rage feats, but you don't.....<br><br>Then it should definitly be in there. I saw in a post a guy that claimed he had to much skillpoints, but again I come short. I always do. I need intimidate. Got to lower a few of the others, find out what is expendable, and then find a feat for it.<br><br>Thanks guys. Still I have much to learn.....

Another one for the Epic Viking Mythology guild.  Well done.  And a rare one, too, as you noted the only other build around with these classes, and that one looks completely different from this one.  <br><br>And if you can fit TR in there, say at LvL 24, that would be icing on the cake.  Rich delicious icing.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
