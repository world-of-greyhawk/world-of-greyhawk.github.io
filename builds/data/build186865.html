<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM</b><br><br>I was working on this build a while ago, as an offshoot of my Disciple of Torm builds. In conjunction, these two builds are good for the discovery part of a new PW - the first few levels and feats are very similar, so you can choose which way to take the character after you've got to grips with the PW you're playing on. The Disciple of Torm is more smite-based, whereas this build is more of a straight-up Cleric.<br><br>I finished the levelling guide for this build ages ago, before Christmas even, but I haven't got around to testing it or posting the write up until now. As something of a first for me, I've managed to host the actual .bic file of the build on my uni webspace. I'm not sure if this will work, but the link is <a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/%7Eu1jt/lauramelios1.bic" target="_blank">http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~u1jt/lauramelios1.bic</a><br>if you want to test it for me.<br><br>Anyway, here's how to level the build itself.<br>Human, Lawful Good<br>Str 16<br>Dex 8<br>Con 12<br>Int 12<br>Wis 14<br>Cha 14<br>I worked out the build would have enough ability increases to get 20 Wis and 28 Cha, if i started with one of them at 14 and the other at 15. But 20 Wis isn't really necessary to the build, it gives +1 to spell DCs and an extra 5th level spell, neither of which are crucial. So I started with 14 in both Wis and Cha, which because of the 2-for-1 ability point raises, effectively nets +2 to Con. Definitely worth the fiddling, IMO.<br><br><br>Levelling Guide<br>1 - Cleric 1 - Toughness, Extra Turning, War &amp; Trickery domains<br>2 - Cleric<br>3 - Cleric 3 - Empower Spell<br>4 - Cleric 4 - Wis 15<br>5 - Cleric 5<br>6 - Cleric 6 - Zen Archery<br>7 - Cleric<br>8 - Cleric 8 - Wis 16<br>9 - Paladin 1 - Weapon Focus Rapier<br>10 - Cleric 9<br>11 - Cleric 10<br>12 - Cleric 11 - Cha 15, Improved Crit Rapier<br>13 - CoT 1<br>14 - CoT 2 - Power Attack<br>15 - Paladin 2 - Divine Might<br>16 - CoT 3 - Cha 16<br>17 - CoT 4 - Cleave<br>18 - Cleric 12 - Divine Shield<br>19 - CoT 5<br>20 - CoT 6 - Cha 17, Blind Fight<br>21 - Cleric 13 - Great Wis 1 (17)<br>22 - CoT 7<br>23 - CoT 8 - Great Wis 2 (18)<br>24 - Cleric 14 - Cha 18, Great Cha 1 (19)<br>25 - Cleric 15<br>26 - CoT 9<br>27 - CoT 10 - Great Cha 2 (20) Great Wis 3 (19)<br>28 - Cleric 16 - Cha 21<br>29 - Cleric 17<br>30 - Cleric 18 - Great Cha 3 (22)<br>31 - CoT<br>32 - CoT 12 - Cha 23<br>33 - CoT 13 - Great Cha 4 (24)<br>34 - CoT 14 - Epic Weapon Focus Rapier<br>35 - Cleric 19<br>36 - Cleric 20 - Cha 25, Great Cha 5 (26)<br>37 - Cleric 21<br>38 - Cleric 22<br>39 - Cleric 23 - Great Cha 6 (27), Armour Skin<br>40 - Paladin 3 - Cha 28<br><br>Final Stats (unbuffed)<br>Str 16<br>Dex 8<br>Con 12<br>Int 12<br>Wis 19<br>Cha 28<br><br>Skill Points<br>The build gets 172 skill points in total. I distributed them like this:<br>43 Discipline<br>43 Concentration<br>39 Spellcraft<br>20 Tumble<br>1 Open Lock<br>1 Disable Trap<br>3 Lore<br>This way, the build can actually make proper use of Trickery domain. You know how DMs like to fill a cave full of undead, then place loads of locks and traps in there to make sure Rogues have something to do, and to enforce party play? This build can tackle both, so there's no need for a Rogue, unless the traps and locks have mhuge DCs. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  <br><br>The final HP is 434, if you take maximum at every level. That's about average for a Cleric, and as always, the Cleric buffs like Endurance and Aura of Vitality help out a lot here.<br><br>The build relies totally on buffs to get a decent AC. It's kind of a cross between a charisma based Paladin (who don't get great AB) and a battle cleric, (who don't get great AB without buffs), so it really does need to take some time buffing. With all the long term buffs at its disposal in place, the build's AB is around 42 with a rapier, depending on the Bull's Strength roll. With every buff in place, the character sheeet says something like 67 with a rapier, but when i tested the build and looked at the actual rolls, it was something like 56 with a rapier, 51 with a bow.<br><br>The flexibility of the build is enhanced by the Zen Archery feat. You can lay "traps", like casting an Empowered Blade Barrier over a choke point and firing arrows at the mob on the other side. Archery's also handy to draw mobs into a Storm of Vengeance. And when each arrow is doing 10 points of Divine damage, which isn't often resisted, it's hard to ignore the person firing them.<br><br>I almost forgot to mention the saving throws. Without any buffs, the build's saving throws at level 40 are Fortitude 43, Reflex 34, Will 40. If autofail on 1 is disabled, so too is any chance of killing the Dazzling Battle Cleric with any instant death spells. It also helps with saving against Dev Crit, not many builds have a DC higher than 45 or so.<br><br>Let me know if the download link doesn't work, I'll try to sort it out if it doesn't.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 07/07/05 23:37</span></i></p>

I managed to get a screenshot of the fully buffed character sheet on my webspace too. <br><br><a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/%7Eu1jt/dbcfb.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~u1jt/dbcfb.jpg</a><br><br>That's the character sheet with full buffs on, even the short term ones, and all the special abilities like Divine Wrath and Battle Mastery (War domain). The only magical equipment in use at that time is Boots of Speed, everything else (rapier, tower shield, full plate) is non-magical, just buffed. So everything on that list of damage types is from a buff of one kind or another. So her final damage total, if the enemies don't have any DR, is 1d6 + 43, and she threatens a crit on a roll of 15 or higher. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Herbie Shimmer on 03/24/05 13:42</span></i></p>

12 Int allows you to cross class Tumble, which is +4 AC at level 40. <br><br>As the build is intended for PW play too, it doesn't have to be used for Tumble. On many PWs it's handy to have a few ranks in things like Lore, Heal or Appraise. As you pretty much have to max Discipline, Concentration and Spellcraft, there's a good case for having an extra skill point per level.
