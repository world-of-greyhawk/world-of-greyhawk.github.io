<b>Playable from level 1 - 40  PvM</b><br><br>There are rumours that have circulated throughout the Warriors Guild of many cities that an elite few are always on duty.  Though few in number, the Shadowsong Knights, as they are called, are believed to be the very last defense  against certain enemies.  Not your typical warriors, they excel at quick movement, easily dodging and evading blows that would easily cleave through your average fighter.  They are just as quick with their own weapons, prefering to use two weapons to quickly hack away at their opponents.  But the Shadowsong Knights are much more than a quick eye and quicker hand, but they also have learned and studied for many years, just to become initiates.  The youngest member to this Elite Corps was 49.  Their studies have allowed them to learn the workings of magic, yet they are not direct users of arcane arts.  They have learned also the secrets of the shadows, using them to conceal and aid them in battle.  Their are few things more unnerving than to see a dozen warriors, chanting, appearing in the midst of your camp, injuring many of your comrades beforing vanishing back into the night air.  Those cities who have such elite soldiers have never been worried by enemies camping outside their gates...<br><br>Shadowsong Knight<br>16 Fighter, 8 Bard, 16 Shadowdancer<br>1-40, PvM<br><br>Human<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 18 to 32<br>Con 14<br>Int 14<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 8<br><br>Leveling is really a matter of what you need when.

A nice Strength belt, or weapon with good elemental damage will supplement this.  EPS also helps, doubling the damage output of the humble handaxe.

Took maybe 4 minutes or so.  Had to drink a potion to ensure no crit would take him out.  Basically, against fighters and rogues, use shadow daze, ramp up the AC against the fighters, and have at them.  disappear in combat to confuse and annoy.  against cleric and mage just strike from shadows repeatedly.<br><br>I am tired.

I've seen it stack - offline and online.  You have to increase the time that it lasts in order to notice the difference - in my case, offline I have it bumped to 15 rounds.<br><br>On the PW I play on, shadowevade is extended to several rounds, makes the class more worthwhile imho.  HiPS does nothing truly useful there since most mobs and all but one epic bosses have truesight.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 08/10/05 10:34</span></i></p>

Oh and to the original poster, its a nice build. However Ive yet to make a build that with magical equipment and +8 weapons failed to take out a prismatic dragon. <br><br>Ive only created one to do it with no magical equipment whatsoever. Ive also only created one dex build/ED/concealment build that easily took out a level 40 fighter without using hips when equipment with normal equipment. With hips ive taken out the very same fighter with a level 10 character however. <br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

Heh I remember testing a HiPS vs. Anuis and I was overloading hsi system with hiding and then unloading 5 hits and rehiding before he could get an attack in. I would crash him every time. That being said, I think you may want to look at assigning some specific levels to classes. There is definately some min/maxing that can be done that you are not giving people the slightest idea how to do. For instance if you take bard as your first level you lose nothing except a bonus feat, but gain quite a few more skill points. If you assign levels in certain ways it could mean the difference between three attacks a round or four. I know you posted a 12/4/4 split for level 20, but I don;t see why you can't push a couple fighter levels up earlier and move some bard levels or shad dancer levels later to get some higher AB. Another thing to look at is how level splits pre epic affect your saving throws. Well hope this helps.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Nice catch.  I was tired and didn't remember correctly.  But yes it does stack.  I thought it lasted for 10 rounds, but perhaps I was wrong again...well, it is for a (very) short boost to AC, which is what it accomplishes.  I am not sure whether to consider it a bug, since the skill is kinda useless with such a short duration anyways, maybe they left it in for just such an emergency? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">  <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>However Ive yet to make a build that with magical equipment and +8 weapons failed to take out a prismatic dragon.<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Good point.  I tried him with normal equipment, but without a higher AB from spells or equipment he just couldn't hit the dragon, except once every few minutes, and more because the dragon fell on his blade by accident, i suspect.  also you need the ac boost against a powerful melee attacker.  with fighters you have impr expertise, still with enough umph to hit back, but dragons...oh well, never said it was a GOOD build... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>For instance if you take bard as your first level you lose nothing except a bonus feat, but gain quite a few more skill points.<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I also lose the ability to have CHA lower than 10, i believe.  and at level 1 you really need weapon finesse.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>I know you posted a 12/4/4 split for level 20, but I don;t see why you can't push a couple fighter levels up earlier and move some bard levels or shad dancer levels later to get some higher AB<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>With a dual wielding AB of 40, for a non WM build, is pretty good, I thought.  Also, without the fighter levels in the epic, I lose out on EWF and EWS, which I thought took a lot away from the build.  Also, what feats would you take pre-epic?  Nothing really important sprung to mind, but you could always remove iron will for something else if you like.  heck, even removing the TWF, Ambi and ITWF would net you lotsa room to play with pre-epic feats, but this build seemed to be lacking epic feats to me.  I also didn't give a thought to saves in pre-epic...dang.

You can take epic weapon focus on any feat. You only need to  take one level of fighter post epic to get EWS.
