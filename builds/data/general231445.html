I see a ton of builds that use <b>Barbarian</b> and I see that they all use the <b>Greatsword</b>. Is there a good reason as to why? In the PW Im playing on, it has more longsword than anything else. =)<br><br>Thx CA..<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.dladventures.com/" target="_blank">DLA</a> <br>I was baptized with the Holy Spirit when I took Him by simple faith in the Word of God....

Greatsword, like all 2-handed weapons, gets STR MODIFIER *1.5 added to damage.<br><br>The multiplier has a big effect on the STR-builds.

How about AB? Is that effected as well? <br><br>The longsword have multi dammages added to them, say, fire 1d8, electric 1d8 and so forth. About 4-6 vs 1-3 on the greatsword. So, is it safe to say that longsword will to better since there are more added dammage bonus's?<br><br>Sorry, just trying to get a better understanging of the way things work...<br><br>CA..<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.dladventures.com/" target="_blank">DLA</a> <br>I was baptized with the Holy Spirit when I took Him by simple faith in the Word of God....

Generally Speaking--<br><br>If strength/feats of the wielder are equal:<br><br>-AB will be the same.<br><br>-Longsword and shield have higher AC.  <br><br>-Greatsword will have higher damage output.<br><br>Elemental damage is too much of a variable.  It depends on the items on your server.  The server I play on has absolute crap for greatswords, but has many many longswords.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By coreyb on 02/23/06 06:47</span></i></p>

In HotU, both longswor are available with:<br>+1 with 1d4 elemental damage<br>+2 with 1d10 electrical (Astral Blade)<br>+3 with 1d6 elemental damage<br>+4, with +5 vampiric (Enserric)<br>+8, with 2d6 elemental damage<br>+6 with +8 Str (Aramil's)<br><br>Greatswords are available as:<br>+1 with +2 elemental damage<br>+3, with 1d6 elemental damage<br>+4, with +5 vampiric (Enserric)<br>+8, with 2d6 elemental damage<br><br>Except for Aramil's and the +2 Astral blade, they are pretty much perfectly balanced in terms of enhancement and damage bonus. With the smith, you can make either type pretty much identical. So unless you are looking at a PW with better weapons of one type vs. the other, they should be about equal.<br><br>The bigger issue is the ability to use a shield, and the str bonus multiplier. Because of this I think dex-based characters should almost always use a longsword (or other 1-handed weapon, or a light weapon for dual-wielding), and str-based characters may prefer a two-handed one.<br><br>Lastly, a barbarian with a big sword looks cool, and is fun to RP. The shield and little sword look doesn't go as well with the outfits. <br><br>TM
