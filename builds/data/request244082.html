Wow, I certainly do not mean to argue, but this is a build idea.  Sure I asked for suggestions but I have seen many do this in other posts.  The primary reason however was to post a different take on the exaulted sorcerer.  Again, it has been some time since I posted here, mostly because I can't seem to do it right and get corrected by a moderator every time I try.  I have many builds because I am an addict, but every time I have tried to use this avenue to get some "serious" support or try to provide a strong build, I get hit by a moderator for not doing something right and then I never get the intended feedback that this was for.<br><br>I am probably making someone angry and that is not my intent, but I WOULD LOVE FOR SOMEONE TO HELP ME!!!<br><br>I want to be an active member of this forum and find it difficult to "fit the mold".<br><br>Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!<br>_________________<br>May the Gods smile upon you!<br><br>Dezba

If you have a completed build that has been tested and is ready for others to play, then you post it in the epic character builds part of the forum.  If you want advice on how to improve a build or modify a build, which is what you appear to be asking, then it is posted in this forum.  If you want a general rules clarification then it is posted in the general discussion forum.<br><br>That said,<br><br>Quicken spell is a bit of a waste.  If you can get boots of speed it is a complete waste.  You can cast an extended haste that lasts 76 rounds, haste has the same effect as quicken spell and the two do not stack.  <br><br>One possibility might be to take two more paladin levels and grab divine shield pre-epic.  With your high charisma, it will really pump up your AC.  <br><br>You also should really consider grabing the spell foci feats.  Your Spell DC is low for a primary caster (20+spell level), many characters with regular saving throws who have maxed out thier spell craft will only fail their saves on a 1 against those spells.  You should really consider improving your DCs, even if you will br mostly relying on bigby's hands and IGMS, it is always nice to have a couple of other nukes or death spells up your sleeves.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Thank you for your feedback and I am sorry if I seemed too upset, but I LOVE building and this forum, but I have had a very difficult time fitting in.  So please accept my appoligy and thanks for the feeback.  Practice make perfect I guess...<br><br>Ok, so will this work better then?

I agree on dropping discipline too, at least if you didn't plan on taking Epic Skill focus: discipline. <br>Your DC won't suffer from Paladin levels.<br><br>Spell DC= 10 + CHA-modifier + Spell-level + focus feats.<br><br>With a 30 CHA and Epic spell foci your DC's are decent, but not totally "up there".<br><br>As for who that has better saves than this build, I can list a couple of hundred builds. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  But they are still way better than a pure sorcerers saves.

Let me clarify a few points.<br><br>Being a build idea , it actually belongs in this forum. <br><br>Untested and/or not yet finished builds belong here too. <br><br>Besides, asking advice about a few minor tweaks on an existing (and quite famous) build, definitely belongs here and the same holds true for a complete and tested build which happens to be the same as a previous one a couple of feat choices apart. Which is to say, tweaks also belong here or in the original thread as a suggestion to the OP.<br><br><br>This said, no one here is hitting you. One of the moderators tasks is to lock and /or move misplaced threads, as in this case for the reasons I offered above. Only the post is being hitten, not the poster. Besides, the thread has been indeed moved here, so that feedback and advice could b eoffered by those willing to do so.<br><br>To be an active member and "fit the mold" the only things required are a polite attitude and respecting the forum rules. If unsure about the latter, ask a mod. We are here to help <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br><br><b>PS</b>: Check my sig to know how to post a build and give a look to the most recent posts by our more experienced guild members to get an even better grip on format requirements.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail

ok, I formally appoligize for my reaction...I have been undergoing some RL stress that is appearently causing me to react differently to things then I normally would.  So again, I am sorry for my reaction.<br><br>Thank you for your understanding messages in return it has certainly helped my point of view.<br><br>Wow, I think I may need to take a vacation...hehe I look for any excuse for that one. <br><br>Anyway, back to the topic at hand.
