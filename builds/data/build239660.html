Just a note, but you only get a 15BAB with your pre-epic scheme.  I don't think you get 10 apr unless you get 16BAB.  Those 7 levels of WM aren't doing you any favors, either.<br><br>And when do you take that 1 point of Int?<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Why +1 INT as the final stat boost? It gives you almost nothing. <br><br>Drop Epic Toughness for Great DEX and change the last sta boost to DEX, for +1 AB, +1 AC, or alternatively do the same for CON for a +20 HPs, +1 For save.<br><br>As GD pointed out, you get at most 9 apr (with flurry and hasted) not 10. If you want the 10 apr you've got to take the 3/4 AB classes in multiples of 4, so either Monk 8/Rogue 8, either Monk 4/Rogue 12. I'd go for the first split, def roll can wait.<br><br>Start as a rogue for more skillpoints too. I'd consider getting some trap skills too.<br><br>Finally, <b>where are your Saving Throws?</b> <br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 05/05/06 14:21</span></i></p>

Before I say anything, let me first admit that I am biased against Weapon Masters.  Have never liked them, and will probably never play one.<br><br>Okay, that said, I see that you are taking <i>4</i> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">    pre-epic feats in epic levels.  Such are the consequences of making a WM without Fighter or CoT levels, and it translates to 4 fewer Great Dex (or Str, depending on the build).  What do you get from 7 WM?  Only +1 AB, so you're already at a loss in that department.<br><br>At the very least, I would drop the IC (Kama) feat.  Your AB is low enough that the extra threat range probably won't help you.<br><br>Speaking of low AB, I would also drop the TWF feats.  As far as I'm concerned, 38 is kind of at the cusp of allowable TWF AB, and even then only when you have self buffing abilities (some of the others may disagree).  When you are as feat starved as you are, it becomes a fairly easy decision to drop them.<br><br>Final tweaks, drop starting Str to 9, and bump starting Int to 14.  You won't even notice the loss to damage, and that should get you enough skill points to put a rogue skill or two at a useable level (put it into Set Trap and you will more than make up for the lost damage <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> ).  You can also get 5 more ranks by lowering Tumble and UMD a touch. . .both only work on multiples of 5 (Tumble on the base ranks, UMD on the modified ranks).<br><br>Good luck <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>There's always time to procrastinate.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By koolthursday on 05/05/06 13:34</span></i></p>

<!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;What do you get from 7 WM?  Only +1 AB, so you're already at a loss in that department.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Well, the WM levels also give him increased critical damage and critical threat range, thus alleviating the "where does the damage come from in a stand-up fight" problem with sneak-attacking dex characters to a degree.<br><br>Whether or not that's worth the price of entry, however, is up for debate - he's already got sneak attacks and free IKD.  But 7 WM levels do provide a much more significant benefit than a small bonus to AB. <br><br>Of course, kamas are lousy critical weapons and his AB is weak enough that, in many epic environments, he will end up being a "20 machine" even if he single-wields.  I'm not really sure why people build these characters - attacks per round are meaningless if you don't hit with them.<br><br>In all... I'm not too impressed.  There are better builds for this purpose, and this one isn't offering me anything to get excited over.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
