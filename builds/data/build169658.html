<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>The Black Jester - Bard 14/RDD 10/BG 16  <br><br>Here's another bard/blackguard build I worked up today. This evil minstrel has tremendous combat abilities due to his draconic heritage. He has devastating critical, improved knockdown to create sneak attacks (+5d6), an epic vrock servant to assist in combat, a Taunt skill check of 50, full Spellcraft, Tumble, Discipline, and Use Magic Device skills. In addition, he has access to 4 levels of Bard spells for pre-combat buffing. In addition to arcane spells, he has the bardic Curse Song which can be used at the same time as his Bard Song.<br><br>His naked AC is 24, he rolled 401 hit points, and he has 4 attacks per round (unhasted).

I was curious if you could explain to me the usefulness of the Taunt skill. <br>In the single-player game, it was a good way to be evil while maintaining a good alignment... but otherwise I didn't see much use for it.

i love this build against good characters for PvP. only suggestions i would change are to max out str and lower dex to 8. int only needs to be 12. you dont need if you lvl like this you should will be able to max out your skill points and get rid of having such a high lore, with me its useless with potions of lore to buy.<br><br>(on my server they really dont allow you to stack skill points so i figured if you save no more then 10 and space them out you might be able to get away with it)<br><br>bard-5 lvls (max out tumble, taunt, perform)<br>rdd-4 lvls (max out discipline and spellcraft)<br>blackguard-1 lvl (max out taunt, discipline) you'l need   <br>     this class to pick up new feats<br>bard-1 lvl (max out tumble, taunt, perform again)<br>rdd-5 lvls (max out disciple and spellcraft)<br><br>bard 6/rdd 10/blackguard 1 now. youll have +2 bonus to int. and thus maxing your potential int bonus for more skill points.<br><br>take the last 4 lvls in blackguard before epic, and you'll have 4 attacks per round. although if you might get higher saves if you take blackguard at an early lvl and bipass more skill points from the rdd int bonus, but thats to much to figure out. <br><br>i would take out lingering song, toughness, improve KD, and replace with expertise and 2 epic str's. with the str so high as it is, you'll still be able to KD anything. i would also take out epic servant which completely sucks on most mods.<br><br>if you stagger every bard lvl with 2 blackguard lvls towards the end of the build you can then choose epic skill taunt for blackguard at like lvl 38 or 39 instead of the servant. then at lvl 40 bard, you can take epic skill tumble to grab another +2ac. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  you'll have killer ac, i think i got as high as 60-70.<br><br>to me, this is the best uber build you can make with balance. you get tons of offense and tons of defense.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bad213Boy on 10/19/05 21:24</span></i></p>

oh ya for got, take con at 12 instead of 14 at start. to me this is one of the best builds in game. i felt i had to max its potential. you dont need dex caues you wear full plate when taking blackguard and use cats grace for the extra dex bonus you lose.<br><br>hmm no ac bonus for epic tumble huh, ill have to check that one out. well even then, if you can grab an extra feat and get rid of that servant and perhaps take epic prowess you'd be in really really really great shape.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bad213Boy on 10/19/05 21:57</span></i></p>

One thing I wanted to point out is your recommended leveling scheme costs you AB. Specifically, taking 10 levels of RDD pre-epic is going to cost you. Since RDD is on the 3/4 schedule, you should stick with 4 or 8 levels of RDD pre-epic. Same with Bard. Taking anything other than 4, 8, or 12 levels of these classes pre-epic permanently handicaps your AB.<br><br>Also, your math doesn't add up.
