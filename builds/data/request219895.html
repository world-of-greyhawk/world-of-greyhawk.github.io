I’ve looked, and don’t see a single rogue/monk/weapon master.  Maybe it’s because they stink, in fact, I’m pretty sure it does due to the severe lack of feats.  <br><br>However, here’s what I wanted – a high AC, a high AB, especially with dual wielding, and if I could get it, Epic Dodge.  I’d like to also have self concealment, but can’t quite work a way.  This character gets these things, as well as 6d6 sneak attack, to help out his somewhat paltry damage.  I plan to play him on a high magic server – so the multitude of attacks will be aided by lots of bonus damage on every hit from his weapon(s).  He’ll also have no trouble getting +12 Dex/+12 Wis.  He has terrible will and fort saves, but I’ll be able to get death immune/mind immune.  I should also point out that stealth skills are useless on my server - as many, many monsters have true seeing.<br><br>If anyone has advice on how to build something better that meets the criteria, or to adjust this, I’d love to hear it.  In particular, I wonder if I should drop more Monk and add enough Rogue to get Improved Evasion that way, or if I should give up on Weapon Master – though I don’t know how I’d get my AB high enough that way.<br><br>Here’s my first pass:<br><br>Race - Human<br>Alignment - Lawful<br><br>Starting Stats<br>Str 10<br>Dex 17<br>Con 12<br>Wis 14<br>Int 13<br>Cha 8<br><br>Leveling<br>1 Rogue1 dodge, mobility<br>2 Monk1 <br>3 Monk2 wf kama<br>4 Rogue2<br>5 Rogue3<br>6 Monk3 Expertise<br>7 Monk4<br>8 Monk5<br>9 Monk6 spring attack<br>10 Monk7<br>11 Monk8<br>12 Rogue4 whirlwind attack<br>13 WM1<br>14 WM2<br>15 WM3 weapon finesse<br>16 WM4<br>17 WM5<br>18 WM6 twf<br>19 WM7<br>20 WM8<br>21 Monk ambidexterity<br>22 Rogue<br>23 Rogue<br>24 Rogue improved twf<br>25 Rogue<br>26 Rogue<br>27 Rogue improved crit kama<br>28 WM<br>29 WM<br>30 WM Great Dex<br>31 WM<br>32 WM Epic WF+<br>33 WM Epic Dodge<br>34 WM<br>35 WM Epic Prowess+<br>36 WM Great Dex<br>37 Monk<br>38 WM<br>39 WM Armor Skin+<br>40 Rogue<br><br>Ending Stats<br>Str 12<br>Dex 30<br>Con 12<br>Wis 14<br>Int 14<br>Cha 8<br><br>Skills<br>Tumble – 40<br>Disable Device – 43 (44)<br>Search – 43 (44)<br>UMD – 43 (42)<br>Discipline – 43 (43)<br>Open Lock – 43 (53)<br>7 left over<br><br>HP – 237.5 average<br><br>AC – 34 Naked (10 + 10 Dex + 2 Wis + 2 Monk + 8 tumble + 2 Armor Skin)<br><br>AB – 45 with a mundane kama (27 + 10 Dex, + 1 WF, + 2 EWF, +1 Epic Prowess, +4 WM)<br>Attacks with flurry and dual wielding – 41/41/41/38/38/35/32/29/26 (17-20) x3<br><br>Saves <br>Fort 20<br>Reflex 41<br>Will 21<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By michaelnoah on 11/10/05 21:03</span></i></p>

It looks like that works.  There's no way you can fit in SC V, though.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I agree that there's not much of a way to get it in.  I originally had 18 monk levels for empty body instead - but I think the attack bonus from weapon master is more important.  Rarely have I seen dual wielding builds, with or without flurry, that have an attack bonus this high.<br><br>Do you suppose there's anything to do about the fact that its feats are so spread out, i.e. no weapon finesse until 15?

Nice build with the ranger to get some skills.  Very nice attack bonus.  Gets better damage with strength.  But... the AC on this build is 8 higher, and he gets UMD, which is pretty essential on my world.  I might just have to live with the weaknesses if I want to get all my toys...

Dual Kamas would give a lot of chances to roll the 20's needed, and I guess if there are usually plently of people on the pw leeching to 15 could be possible.<br><br>Imo you'd be better with taking paladin over wm levels. 19 levels of paladin is relatively difficult for melee/magic builds, and if it isn't you'll have some divine favours to cast at a moments notice. If you take extend spell you should get some nice mileage from buffs. You also get holy sword (which happens to work for kamas for some reason) and a better fort save, but lower reflex. <br><br>Only thing you'd be missing is a higher crit range, but the benefits outweigh this imho.
