Yo guyzz... Yeah so, I had an idea for a build (not the best idea ever, but an idea) and I was wondering if anyone could offer some insight to put it in action!<br><br>I was thinking a.. 21 Ranger/12 Druid/7 Monk type o' build, and this build would use the Panther Wildshape.. and it would also use feats like Improved Knockdown/Disarm, and Called Shot: Legs! (Like a Panther, ya know?!)<br><br>Yeah I know I must be crazy.. but.. who isn't?<br><br>So yeah.. all help is appreciated..<br><br>I have yet to put together a leveling chart.. because well.. I have no clue how to get this up to 40 so that it's playable 1-40!<br><br>Thank you all! And have a great day. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">

Why Panther? IF you really want an animal form, I'd recommend Dire Bear, but that too is quite weak when you get to a certain point, so I just want to know why you're gonna do this, and what conditions you play under?<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

It's just something fun to do. Not a power build or anything like that. I'm just genuinely interested in seeing a build that is focused on utilizing the Panther Wild Shape.<br><br>Though I know the shape doesn't really add much in terms of power, but it adds something in terms of flair.<br><br>Don't you think it would be interesting to see a panther leap out of the shadows and pounce upon it's prey?!<br><br>Yeah I sound really weird..<br><br>Anyways.. this isn't for any specific PW or module.. just thought I could create a template that could be modified for other worlds in the future, and I'm horrible at building! So I came to you guys. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">

The only really annoying trouble with Dire Shapes is DR, your claws work like +1 or something low like that, so if you ever want to kill enemies you require a little trick. If you're buffed with Stoneskin for example, for some odd reason, your claws will work as +5, so, simply put, you want a high level Premonition so that your attacks pierce DR, which means mor Druid levels, I like to take 24 Druid levels to max Owl's Insight, which works cool having Monk. You say you want Ranger 21 to add damage from Bane of Enemies obviously, but a build like that is meant to be played starting at level 34 to get the BAB from Ranger and the shifts...<br><br>If you can make some Alignment shifts, taking Paladin or Blackguard levels to raise BAB and grab Divine Might is a big boost, that divine damage will pierce pretty nice, and a shifter type of build won't need to spend ability points on STR, DEX or CON, so you have plenty of points for a high CHA.<br><br>Another easier way is to take Cleric, no alignment shift trouble, but no high BAB, and Divine Power just doesn't work very good on a shifter, though there are some buffs that will still work ok.<br><br>So, my suggestion would go for Druid 24 / Blackguard 13 / Monk 3, that gets Divine Might, 4d6 sneak attack, good Druid buff level and spells just in case, higher shifts for when you're in trouble and just need to survive and enough Monk for skilldumps. 7 Monk is too much, if you want IKD just take it as a feat, shifter builds usually end with a lot of useless feats, Disarm and Called Shot are not nearly as good as IKD, so I wouldn't take them. I could make this build if you like it, but I don't think Ranger 21 / Druid 12 / Monk 7 is such a good idea, sorry, won't be helping there.<br><br>If I remember correctly, the Panther has DEX as its high stat, so make sure you grab Weapon Finesse.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Wow.. thanks a lot Thax!<br><br>Actually I believe that STR is the high stat.. I thought DEX was at first, but when I shifted the Strength was much higher. I might be mistaken..<br><br>But your ideas sound really cool.. I think I'll try them out now.<br><br>P.S. I wasn't really fond of the 21 ranger levels in the first place, is it just me or is ranger just a wimpy fighter?<br><br>Thanks<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Rangers can actually dish out some good damage against their favored enemies. BoE is 2d6 and a level 40 gets +9 damage.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By whirlin_merlin on 12/01/08 01:55</span></i></p>
