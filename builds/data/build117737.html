Just a query; would it be beneficial to adda few more wiz levels; adding an extra int point as well (extra points too to add into tumble/intimidate/etc)?

This looks a good mix for a free for all Arena - very hard to hit and hard to affect with spells, especially for 25 rounds until the Empty Body runs out.<br><br>I presume that there are some special circumstances in your Arena, which make it particularly effective though, e.g. otherwise someone waits till you use Empty Body then cast Greater Sanctuary, or starts off with Time Stop and Maxed IGMS, or as an AA sits back and peppers you with arrows while you're whirling away like a dervish.<br><br>Outside the True Strikes your AB and Damage will be relatively low I would have thought.

Funny thing - I was eating my nachos thinking of interesting character builds and I "came up" with the idea of a monk 20+/Wizard/Palemaster 10.<br><br>After I mopped up my nachos and downed my Corona (and sent the wife out and put baby to bed) I headed over to the Novice to Epic Module to develop a character.<br><br>I'll post my build in a separate post (I went strength-based for Devastating Critical) but I wanted to point out that this build here loses out on spells by having an intelligence of 14. Reason being that the 10 levels of palemaster give you bonus spells. My character has only 5 wizard levels, yet he can memorize 2 or 3 5th level wizard spells (which you requires an intelligence of 15).<br><br>Kaliban.
