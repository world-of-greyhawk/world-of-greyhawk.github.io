Nice build. Pretty good saves for a fighter, which is a good use of all those feats. One suggestion - make the second weapon a 2-hander to get the 1.5x str bonus. That way you get some extra damage against crit-immune enemies. I recommend that it also be blunt for undead (great flail, etc.). Making the primary one a high threat range like scim or rapier is a good idea also, as you already noted.<br><br>TM
