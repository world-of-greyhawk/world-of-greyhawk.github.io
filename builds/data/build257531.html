Looks good.  You'll have to juggle a few feats around as Improved Crit has a BAB of +8 prereq.  You may also have shorted yourself some AB.  BAB26+4 for WF,EWF, EP, and +12 for Wisdom and +15 for Enchant Arrow = 57 AB.<br><br>I would also consider dropping Finesse for Blindfighting, and maybe taking those 2 points in Charisma and putting them into Constitution.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

It looks nifty.  Good way of getting Monk speed on an archer without having to worry about a huge loss of AC every time you're flat-footed, since this class split can't get Uncanny Dodge.  You lose 1 AB/AC and a pre-epic feat for that, but that may well be worth it.  Neat build.

Nice job. I made a build similar to this recently but didn't post it. Great minds think alike. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  I would drop the Great Dexterity and move Epic Prowess to an AA bonus feat and pick up two more Great Wisdom. You would lose 1 AC, gain 1 AC and one AB, and trade 1 Reflex for 1 Will. Translation: break even on AC and gain some AB. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

the reason for only one wiz is the server I play on... Can't  take many wiz lvs or I'm something that I don't want to be. so can't take more and that is also reason for noe SC...other suggestion sounds good. I'm going to try them and maybe later post that here...

This is a really nice looking build. My question is, however, would it be beneficial to move some of those Dex points to Strength?<br><br>Since you are getting most of your AC bonus from Wisdom, as well as your AB bonus, why not add some Strength for the Composite damage bonus?

Once you've poured that much into it, might as well round it out to an even integer.  More Str would certainly be nice, especially since even on a non-Mighty bow, this build has a -1 damage penalty from it, but there's not many good choices to get those stat points.  Honestly, I think the first thing I'd do is drop starting Wis to 16, and put 2 points each into Str, Con, and Int.
