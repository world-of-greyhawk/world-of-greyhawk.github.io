silly question...Why would you need to make a more melee orientated version of this build? I have played it and it is awesome. to be honest, you don't need to change this build at all as what it (may) lack in melee it certainly makes up for it in casting power.

And for the fact that you have to have a minimum of 17 Druid levels now to get Dragon Shape.

Do you want it to be better at unbuffed melee? Well, it's not really a problem, so long as you make it with better BAB and thus change it completely. If you're after better buffed melee in DS, then good luck. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

What makes you think you <b>can</b> make it a better melee? it's like if you ask a pure sorcerer to become a stronger caster, it's impossible. You could make it more playable taking Monk earlier and probably dropping a Cleric level for a monk level (for skilldumps), but that's it, you won't make it stronger because there's no space to make it stronger.<br><br>The Order of Jormundgandr is already the strongest melee dragon in the guild, makes you think that if it could be make stronger it would've been done already (because I kinda tried when I though a Cleric dragon would rock just to find out it was done already). It's going to be technically illegal with version 1.69 though, but it's not hard to change that.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/14/08 17:05</span></i></p>

Well, since you can't make it any stronger...<br><br>I'm thinking of reversing the Druid and Cleric levels, meaning Druid(25), and Cleric(14). Or! Just get the minimum Druid level(18) to get access to Dragon Shape and have Cleric(21) netting me use of both the Cleric and Druid 9th level spells.
