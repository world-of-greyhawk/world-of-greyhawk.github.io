I was looking at this the other night; and trying to come up with a reason why a dexy build when facing multiple opponents can be a problem.  I'm sure there is a reason, but I can't seem to think of or find it.  One-on-one I know it's great; but mobs are the concern where I play... most hitting with a BAB of over 50 (so even an ac of high 60's is worth little face-to-face).  Any insight into how ac is negated, and what ac can be negated would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>My thanks for your time in advance.

When you get caught flat-footed, or you get flanked, your dodge AC bonus is negated.  The mobs will flank you unless you are a class that can not be flanked, like DwD for instance.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

Yeah, if you are going with a dex build you're pretty much limited to the rogue type classes that get the uncanny dodge class feats. So with a dex monk, all that AC goes out the door.<br><br>Brandon

Almost all dodge AC is lost regardless of feats or class (wis monk AC is considered dodge and is not lost , not sure if there are any other dodge AC that doesnt).
