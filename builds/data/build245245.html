The Ariels of Ehlonna, also known as the <i>Knights of the Lion</i>, could probably best be described as Ranger Knights.  While Ehlonna is mostly associated with demi-humans and Druids, she was not without her human followers.  With Domains in Plant and Animal, these armored warriors-priests were not so much protectors of the forest but rather warmongering avatars for it.  Their bastions (the few that there were) were mostly found on the borders where the wilds met the doorstep of civilization.  They were known for both their Strength and their Wisdom, and for their deadly prowess with longswords.  They could summon powerful creatures to their side, gained Truesight earlier than priests to other religions, and were feared for their ability to call upon the insect hordes of Creeping Doom (no save, no spell resistance).  <br><br>They further supported their Divine grace with UMD to cast from any scroll (Improved Invis, Premonition, Spell Mantles), were blessed with Evasion to aid them in their combat against the Dark Arts, and were highly trained in the Longsword, with Epic Weapon Focus, Improved Critical and Epic Weapon Specialization in the blade, which they further augmented with Darkfire, Divine Favor, and other mystic blessings from the Goddess.  When they fully engage Divine Power, they are virtually peerless in battle.<br><br><b>The Fighting Ariel of Ehlonna</b><br><br>Playable: 1-40, Low-Magic PvM, PvP<br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Lawful, Neutral, Chaotic/Good<br>Rogue5/Cleric29/Ftr6<br><br><b>Attributes</b><br>Str16 (26)<br>Int14<br>Wis15 (22)<br>Dex8<br>Con14<br>Chr8<br><br><b>Level Guide</b><br>1 Rogue1, Blindfighting, Knockdown<br>2 Fighter1, Weapon Focus: Longsword<br>3 Cleric1, Extend Spell, Domains: Plant and Animal<br>4 Cleric2, Wis16<br>5 Cleric3<br>6 Cleric4, Empower Spell<br>7 Cleric5<br>8 Cleric6, Wis17<br>9 Cleric7, Scribe Scroll*<br>10 Cleric8<br>11 Cleric9<br>12 Rogue2, Improved Critical: Longsword, Wis18<br>13 Cleric10<br>14 Cleric11<br>15 Cleric12, Lightning Reflexes<br>16 Cleric13, Wis19<br>17 Cleric14<br>18 Cleric15, Toughness<br>19 Cleric16<br>20 Cleric17, Str17<br>21 Fighter2, Great Str I, EWF: Longsword<br>22 Rogue3<br>23 Fighter3<br>24 Fighter4, WS, EWS: Longsword, Str19<br>25 Cleric18<br>26 Cleric19<br>27 Rogue4 Great Str II<br>28 Cleric20, Wis20<br>29 Cleric21<br>30 Cleric22, Epic Reflexes<br>31 Cleric23, Armor Skin<br>32 Fighter5, Str21<br>33 Cleric24, Great Str III<br>34 Cleric25<br>35 Cleric26, Great Wis I<br>36 Cleric27, Great Str IV, Str24<br>37 Rogue5<br>38 Cleric28<br>39 Cleric29, Great Str V, Great Wis II<br>40 Fighter6, Epic Prowess, Str26<br><br>*<i>Indicates Builder's choice</i><br><br><b>Combat Vitals</b><br>Longsword AB: 36/31/26<br>Buffed AB: 62/57/52/62 (no items)<br>AC: 30<br>Buffed AC: 60 (no items)<br>HP: 442<br><br><b>Saves</b><br>Fort: 24 (32)<br>Will: 27 (35)<br>Reflex: 23 (31)<br><br><b>Skills:</b><br>Concentration: 43 (45)<br>Discipline: 43 (50)<br>Tumble: 40<br>UMD: 41 (40)<br>Heal: 13 (20)<br>Open Locks: 10 (12)<br>Lore: 1 (3)<br>Spellcraft: 38 (40)<br>Listen: 5 (12)<br>Craft Armor: 20 (12)<br>Craft Weapon:8 (10)<br><br><b>AC Enhancements:</b><br>Empowered Cats Grace: +2<br>Barkskin: +5 (natural)<br>Shield of Faith: +5 (deflection)<br>Magic Vestment: +10 (armor &amp; shield AC)<br>Full Plate: +8<br>Tower Shield: +3<br>Armor Skin: +2<br>Tumble: +8<br>Battletide: +2  (enemy receives -2AB)<br>Undeaths Foe: +4<br>Final AC w/no items (60)<br><br><b>AB Enhancements</b><br>+6 Strength<br>+5 Divine Favor<br>+6 Divine Power<br>+2 Battletide<br>+5 Greater Magic Weapon<br>+1 Bless<br>+1 Aid<br>+1 Prayer<br>_________<br><br>There is some flexibility here in the build for customization.  For instance, one might prefer to start with a 14Int to get more skill points and to acquire IKD or Expertise.  I felt Knockdown was sufficient, and Expertise was redundant in a build like this, but I can see an argument for more skill points.  Starting with the stats as they are also makes him a bit of a powerhouse at low levels.  <br><br>One can also stop with a 22 Wisdom and raise Str to 26, though personally I believe you get more value out of the Wisdom, since Wis24 grants an extra 7th level slot, which is one more Creeping Doom, or Word of Faith/Greater Restore, or even an Empowered Flamestrike.  <br><br>One will also note that Scribe Scroll is taken in the build.  Perhaps it's just a fad I am in, but I really like this feat in all my casters.  Also, if one prefers, Empowered can be exchanged for Maximize, or Scribe can be exchanged for Maximized.<br><br>Finally, it should be noted that there are 3 base classes used.

Seems to be very powerful. I'd like to query what was your reason to start with 16 CON as opposed to 14? Surely the points would be better spent in bringin WIS to 16, or WIS 15/INT 14. You have good HP anyway.<br>_________________<br>"We keep our Feast of Feasts, sure of our bourne,<br>                 Our aims self-same:<br>The Guest of Guests, friend <i>Zarathustra</i>, came!<br>The world now laughs, the grisly veil was torn,<br>And Light and Dark were one that wedding-morn."

I think it is very very worthwhile to go with a Wis15, Int14, Con14.  In so doing, one could drop IC for IKD, get 43 more skill points, and then free up an Epic Feat.  Sounds like either Epic Reflexes or Fort.

Well, his HP isn't really so high, even with a good buffed AC, even if you write that your buffed AC is without items (although you did counted a normal Heavy armor and Tower Shield) low magical items (+5 or lower) won't actually increase your AC, only Dodge AC, I know you know that, but still, when I read no items it sounded (for me) as if you were saying -wait to see him with items.<br><br>Strong build, and very customizeable indeed, I'd probably change race to dwarf, to get more CON from CHA and start 16 WIS and CON, geting rid of Scribe Scroll, less skills though, but the XP penalty will be there since Fighter being class for dwarf won't help much here.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 06/27/06 15:35</span></i></p>

Scribing is a great ability if your environment has a supply of blank paper for it.  It's definitely worth it for wizards and clerics, who can scribe scrolls of spells that they normally don't memorize during downtime, like when waiting for their partymembers or something.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

*<i>wrenches control of thread from hijacking moderators</i>*<br><br><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/28/06 18:03:55 (GMT) -- Xylophone<br><br>Scribing is a great ability if your environment has a supply of blank paper for it.  It's definitely worth it for wizards and clerics, who can scribe scrolls of spells that they normally don't memorize during downtime, like when waiting for their partymembers or something.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Aye, but I find it spills over into more than just that.  In a persistant world setting, you can scribe scrolls for your party memebers who have UMD, and he who brings Darkfire to a Rogue is a Sneak's best friend, let me tell you. <br><br>It also gives you more options when dungeoneering.  Who wants to take up precious spell slots with spells like Find Traps, True Sight, or See Invis?  Scribe a 5 pack of each and forget about it.  And it's not like it's expensive.  The GP and XP loss is minimal.  It's no where near as expensive as Wand crafting, and I find Scribing more flexible and effective.  Scrolls aren't caster level capped like Wands are.<br><br>But again, this is an environment dependent feat.  If your PW supports Scribing with Blank scrolls (and they should), then all is well. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 06/28/06 23:02</span></i></p>
