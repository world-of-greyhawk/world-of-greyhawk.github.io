I haven't dwelled much into the mage section, but I do know that the best way to become immune to spells, is through your saves. Your saves will defeat just about any Evocation, if they are high enough. However, they cannot stop the effects of Timestop. The best way I can think of to over come it, is 1. attack the other mage out of the spells range of effect, or 2. Use timestop first, and use the little devil's bag of tricks agaisnt him. =p<br><br>Hope this information helps.<br><br>~Nelos<br><br>Note - To become "immune" to the spells, you need to buff your saves up to at least 50.<br>_________________<br>You can't kill what was simply never there. . .

You can't prevent counterspelling (other than killing the counterspelling mage). What you <i>can</i> do, if you know you're going to be counterspelled, is cast a series of low-level 'fodder' spells like magic missile, or ray of frost, and let the enemy mage waste his Dispels and Mords on those. That will leave him with only the actual spell as a counter (assuming he even has it). This should leave you enough of your high level spells that you can outlast him.<br>_________________<br>Captain's Log, Stardate 6051: had trouble sleeping last night... my hiatal hernia is acting up.
