I have a question or two about dev crit and Unarmed Shifter forms.<br><br>I tried making a Dev Crit Spectre, hoping to use the Spectre Touch and land a dev crit while bypassing armor AC.  Didn't work.  Is spectre touch an actual melle attack or is it coded more like a spell attack?<br><br>Tried a Druid Monk build with Dev Crit Unarmed.  When in Elder Earth Elemental form I tried smacking things around and no Dev Crit attempts were ever made.  Can someone confirm this?  Are the Earth Elemental attacks truely "Unarmed" or are they "Creature Weapons"?<br><br>The same question applies for the Vampire form.  Should I be able to Dev Crit in Vamp form?<br><br>(Dev Crit Scythe did work for Risen Lord.)<br><br>Thanks ahead of time.

As I...Samphus said, plus WS/EWS: unarmed <b>do not</b> work when shifted<br><br>The oddest thing is OvCrit: unarmed working and DevCrit: unarmed not *shrugs*<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 02/13/06 21:45</span></i></p>

Anyway, it does stands as an unarmed strike, since it gains monk's unarmed attacks per round and works with some (not all as previously said) unarmed feats like stunning fist, flurry of blows and circle kick.<br><br>Some shifter class shapeshifts have weapons, but for druid shifts, they're all unarmed.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/13/06 22:34</span></i></p>
