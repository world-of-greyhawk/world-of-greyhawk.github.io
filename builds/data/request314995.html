Hello dear forum members, I am playing on a server with several restrictions, I need a good pvp build that can also handle some pve (but if you cant find one a pure pvp will do good aswell). <br><br>the server has all classes and races, some prc's, but most of these are locked and require an application, I cba to do that so I'll need one without the following <br><br>classes you are not allowed to use:<br><br>1. red dragon desciple<br>2. champion of torm<br>3. Assassin<br>4. Shadow dancer<br><br>Also note that the following prc's are available:<br><br>1. deard pirate<br>2. duelist<br>3. mystic thaurge<br>4. thrall of orcus<br>5. arcane trickster<br>6. peerless archer<br><br>other rules: <br><br>you have to invest at least 3 levels in these following classes before level 20 should you take them, 1 level is not allowed:<br>- Barbarian<br>- Cleric<br>- Monk<br>- Paladin<br>- Ranger<br>- Shifter<br><br>these class combinations are illegal:<br>- Assassin/Duelist<br>- Assassin/Shadowdancer<br>- Bard/Blackguard<br>- Bard/Paladin<br>- Monk/Arcane Archer<br>- Monk/Barbarian<br>- Monk/Bard<br>- Monk/Cleric<br>- Monk/Druid<br>- Monk/Shifter<br>- Sorcerer/Paladin<br>- Sorcerer/Blackguard<br>- Shadowdancer/Arcane Archer<br><br>*DEV CRIT IS NOT ALLOWED*<br><br>I know I have a lot of restriction, that is why I have a hard time finding the right build, please help me out, thanks!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By greatmetal on 02/17/10 19:02</span></i></p>

When i see this sort of thing, i know that balance is way out there.  THe dude is tryin so hard to maintain balance that there is more than what you list going on.  <br><br>How on earth can a dude restrict classes, but allow Mystic Theurge in??  IF, and thats a big IF, it is implemented properly, you end up with 35 caster lvls in both divine and arcane!  With spell foci, and probably stats going to arcane spells (as divine is pretty well set with 19 or 20 wisdom), you are an *** kicker!  With this sort of lineup (cleric/wizard for the flexibility) I would devote ALL my cleric spells to melee support (div fav, div power, battletide, etc) with firestorm, SOV in lv 8 and 9 slots.  <br><br>I would focus in Necro, as, if memory serves me, you get Wail and the like on arcane, but you also get the undead dealing spells on the divine side!  I would take empower, still and max for feats.  Extend would be fun, but not necessary with such caster lvls.   I would also take Auto still 3 for wearing FP with a Tower shield.  <br><br>There are SO many tricks that come available to this class (cleric5/wiz5/MT30), it makes me want to come out of retirement!  It is too bad that dev crit is out cuz a 19int 19 wis 25 str dev critter would be soo sweet!  <br><br>That's just my 2 cents though.  WIthout knowing all the other stuff that isnt in your post (there must be alot cuz the owner seems like a huge control freak) that is what i would do.  All this assuming that MT is implemented as it should be, which is probably not <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">

I'd agree with the Fighter/WM/Bard(Or rogue, or whatever)<br>But I'd do 14 Fighter/25 WM/1 Bard, Grab taunt, it's awesome, and easy to build/play.<br><br>OR, if you really want to smack people up...<br><br>11 Fighter / 16 WM / 13 Rogue<br>Elf (20 Dex.

Thank you for all your replies, I am begining to see the picture, and btw, mystic thaurge is well implemented, even better than the nwn 2 one (or as good as),<br><br>also, a layout of a simple 5/5/30 mystic theurge could be nice, since I have no basic Idea of building... just something simple.<br><br>Also, there are prc classes but no prc feats (aka mystic theurge does not require any prc feats to unlock)<br><br>so, should you post your layout, do not use any prc feats, only regular ones! thanks!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By greatmetal on 02/18/10 17:25</span></i></p>

k, this is ONLY from memory, so the stats may be a bit off.<br><br>Human st 10/ dex8/ con10/cha 8/ wis18/Int 16 (hope that will work.. may be off abit, but that is what i would try for)<br><br>Start with 3 cleric lvls (to get lv 2) Spell foc: Necro, still spell, and Gr spell foc:Necro<br><br>3 lvs wizard (you need to learn from scrolls so wiz is best - gives lv 2 spells).  Still spell at lv 6.<br>SKills need to be Lore 6, conc 6, spell craft 6.  If they arent this, you should be shot!  LOL<br><br>Take MT 1-10.  Feats, WF:mace, Empower, Spell Foc: EVO.<br><br>Then 2 cleric (lv 17/18) Max spell<br>THen 2 wizard (19-20) Gr spell foc: EVO.<br><br>Stats: I chose to start with 18 wis so you can add wis at lv 4, then ALL the rest to Intelligence.  End lv 20 with 19wis/20int (based on init stats being correct).<br><br>Epic is all MT.  <br>21 Auto still 1<br>24 Auto Still 2<br>25 (mt bonus) auto still 3 (now can cast freely in armor and tower).<br>27 ESF: necro (for WAIL aka mass killin)<br>30 Gr In 1<br>31 GRI 2<br>33 GR In 3<br>36 GR int 4<br>37 GR in 5<br>39 ESF: evo (the least needed of the feats)<br><br>This ends with wis 19 and INT 30.  You dont "need" esf EVO (implode has +3 anyway) so you could end wis 20 with Gr wis 1 at 39.  Its up to you.  <br><br>This is ALL based on PRC being added exactly like the Players consortium suggests.  You could take ewf Mace as well and end int 30 wis 19, again, depending on choice.<br><br>The terribly nice thing about this guy is, they will get +10ish to ab from Divine power, which means you only need +10 to max ab.  You will also actually get to utilize the 18 str from Divine power as well (something that i have rarely used cuz i play str based clerics).  In full plate and tower, this guy should be a decent cleric wizard.   Use Bigs to pin guys.  Herd and burn.  Use Firestorm and SOV in pve.  PVP, well you got ALOT of tricks (Max igms! LOL).  <br><br>I think, if you REALLY want a pvp build, go gnome and put wis/int at 19 and go ALL IN with Constitution.  That would be taking gr int on MT bonus feats.  The DC on spells would be lower on wizard spells, but you'd be much tougher.  I tended to play pve, so i got away with min/max.  <br><br><br>Hope that helps.

Yes, I understand that, We do have prc spells and epic spells but what I mean is, if I want to take Mystic theurge as earlier as possible I need to change the leveling to something like this:<br><br>1. cleric -&gt; feats<br>2-6. Wizard -&gt; feats and 6 lore 6 spellcraft 6 concentration<br>7. Mystic theurge<br><br>Thats how its unlocked in this server atleast..., not sure If I must take it early though.

You can only take 10 prc lvls pre epic.  It comes down to HOW DO YOU WANT TO PLAY.  In my eyes, the cleric would make it easier to lvl.  Since it isnt an equal split though, i would go 5 straight wizard lvls, then 1 cleric then 10 MT.  Why?  If i had to take 5 wizard to qualify, id go about it early, then i would play from lv 6 onward as a cleric-ish character until i got autostills.  <br><br>With MT, you are adding BOTH classes, which is phenomenal, imo.  Once you get Wail and the like (around lv 18), you may want to ditch the armor for a bit to have the arcane rath!  Then, once you get autostill 3 as early as possible, get back into the armor and kick some real butt.  Of course, you could always still spells until you get autostill...  but Wail is just so so sweet!  <br><br>all this talk is getting me the itch back...
