<b>***Thread posted in wrong forum***</b><br><br>Someone mentioned (wont name names) that a pure sorc can take this build. I've known this to be flawed, to say the least.<br><br>See...the thing about IGMs, Grasping hands...Stuff like that? You gotta click on the target in order to cast, and call me old fashioned but its a little hard to say to ANY sneaker "hey! you mind standing still insight? Im trying to click my spells on you!"<br><br>You got your harms, your heals, and your implosions, and a whole mess of other spells if you wanna eff with'em. and all a sorc can do is ice storm or wilt and pray your where they thought and that you don't have your spell resist up.<br><br>Only true bane of this build is A spottter wizard with LOTS of spell mantles.

Not sure why you bring such a topic here, in this forum? My dad IS stronger than yours anyhow. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br> <br>A few game specific points.<br>True seeing, by default, sees through stealth.<br>Mantle stops both harm and implosion.<br>IGMS is not a target spell, it's an AoE spell. IF someone's hidden, just aim where they disappeared and it strikes home, hidden or not.<br><br>So on, so forth.<br><br>I would presume you'd have more luck, and be more at the right place in the NwN general forum. Build vs build battles are better discussed there. I'll leave this open for now, I'll wait and see how the guild likes it to be.<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Um, read the spell descriptions? You can find them <a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Sorcerer" target="_blank">here</a>. Or heck just read the list of spells, IGMS is far from the "only" available spell, just throw them Horrid Wilting or Wail of Banshee and be happy. Just because IGMS and Ice Storm trespass SR doesn't mean you can't use all the rest because man, high SR that can beat a high level Sorcerer is not that common.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
