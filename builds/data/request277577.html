Heya! <br><br>I'd like an uber sneak attacker build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Good at PvP, since where I come from you can't spam hips <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  So, I assume I'm looking for lots of Rogue or Assassin levels.  <br><br>No PM or RDD, +5 Enviroment, Casters are ubered up, but TS only adds to Spot, doesn't automatically see hidden people, so jacked up Hide and MS is good!<br><br>And hopefully, this guy wont die(easily) in One on One melee. Epic Dodge is a must I'd say,  Self Conceal is cool too, but you can buy items that let you cast One Use Imp Invis easy. <br><br>Dual Wielding looks cool, but, I'd say it pretty much sucks in PvP...I find Shield AC to be too useful to waste. It's an extra +8 AC!  But, if you can convince me and explain how dual wielding sneak would be better, do try <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Lot of high AB Dev critters on the server, those would be my main problem. Also, I'd like to have no Casting classes, and Under 13 bard levels. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Annnnnnd GO! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">

16 paladin<br>1 sd<br>23 rogue<br><br>dex is obviously best since it adds to stealth ab ac epic dodge etc etc. short of any item choices you may have omitted this is the only thing I know of that has saves, stealth, sneak attack, epic dodge and some good melee ability. could have better ab and be harder to dispel with 20 paladin/19 rogue, but if mages are common from the empowerments then the extra 4 levels will probably make little difference to dispellability against a 38 mage levels build.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By D O'Brien123 on 07/01/07 07:07</span></i></p>

Since you can't spam HiPS, you could try a thing called corner-sneaking, or more commonly called CSing.<br><br>Basically, you use Monk speed to hit and run, stealthing around corners out of your enemy's line of sight. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>So, something with 6-20 Monk levels, some Rogue levels, and maybe Fighter or Ranger would work nicely for that.  Though if you go STR-based, you wouldn't really need sneak attacks.

THe only thing is its str based so you will do massive damage and dev crit!  IF you dont like dev crit you have a bunch of free feats to use for other stuff!  Oh, and you could then prob go dex!  Just mess with the numbers and you will do fine (i have faith in you since you are an EPic builder!)  Just think, if you change it to a dexer you can rename the build Tyr's wimpering slice (change wpn too... i used hammer strickly for rp reasons) and post it yourself (with credit to me, of course!).<br><br>Hope that helps (and to the rest.. i apologize for the shameless plug, but i have NEVER done this before.. and wont again.
