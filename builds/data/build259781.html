This is basically a different approach to the high AC sorceror, which combines the good AC of Palemasters with their crit. immune.

ESF: Discipline is more important than concentration. ESF: Spellcraft is always good - higher saves.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

Drop CC and ICC for greater and Epic spell focus. Your casting DC's is still very low though. As for bard, going Autostill you would save feats and gain saving throws by taking a level or two of Paladin (for saves) or even Cleric for Divine shield. You ending CHA is also a bit low, but feat-starvation is what you get from multi-classing a sorcerer.<br><br>Nice build, although getting bard 1 is quite similar to a recent build that had monk instead of bard, but it had no auto still.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

I regret mainly making this build for the server I currently play on.  Most of his feats match it, and also the lack of Epic Evo. focus, as more of the spawns I match up against have low reflex <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>As for Epic Conc. focus, again, there seems to be more discipline gear on my server, but I suppose in the long run Epic Disc. focus may be better.<br><br>I'll look into changing it around, to be better all around.  Thanks for the input.

Paladin will give you Armor proficiency too, which you currently lack even though you add AC numbers with it.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

I tried both a build with 1 Paladin, and 3 Paladin levels.  I decided that, even with the saves, going 1 Bard seemed to benefit what I was looking for more.  Though, switching in epic concentration focus, and subbing Greater/Epic Evocation focus for Combast Casting and ICC helped alot.  Thanks for the tips <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

You're right there, I forgot to mention that once again.  So, I'd lose the 1 AC from wearing scale mail, but also free up some inventory weight.  Also, I liked the extra feat I got out of the Sorceror levels.  Depending on the server, opting for the saves might be better - but with crit. immune, you won't need to worry about devastating criticals, and also with your high spellcraft, there will be no need to fear failing saves against them.  Though, it does lack evasion which could be a problem.  So, depending on your needs, going for 1 or 3 Paladin might be better.  If I wasn't feeling so lazy, I would post the 3 Paladin version here.
