12 DEX with an Elf? look, if a race gives you bonus to a stat that means you increase that stat up to 16 minimum, since you didn't the only thing you get is a penalty to CON. Take human, 1 more feat, 1 more skill/level and stay at 14 CON, better stats overall.<br><br>I'd take 16 STR and 14 CHA instead, since it's more playable to hit and deal damage from the start.<br><br>Now, for the multiclassing tutorial:<br><br>Pure builds are always weaker than multiclassed ones (considering you're smart and multiclass correctly), why? because as you level up your class will start gaining powerful bonuses every time slower, for example, once you get the divine feats and all the Paladin spells taking more Paladin will only increase your Lay on Hands and give epic bonus feats, while taking another class can increase a lot more in a few levels, for example, 4 Fighter levels are enough to take Epic Weapon Specialization and deal +6 damage on all your attacks, if you take Monk from the start and take kamas a single Monk level increases your APR from 4 to 6 with -1 AB penalty and using Flurry of Blows you take 7 APR, very worth it, both cases here Fighter or Monk make damage output rise a lot like more Paladin will never have achieved, now take both and test a Monk 1 / Fighter 4 / Paladin 35 against your Paladin 40 and the pure paladin is going to be owned.<br><br>I hope that was clear enough of why pure builds aren't the top notch. So if you ask me, I never make pure builds, I don't like them.<br><br>Of cours you need to be careful for XP penalty when multiclassg, another reason to take Human over Elf.<br><br>I've never checked gamefaqs for Neverwinter Nights, but if you want to learn building this is the right place.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/03/07 16:58</span></i></p>

True, Wizards, Sorcerers, Druids and Clerics are pretty strong without multiclassing, but heck, they will always be even better multiclassing, that's my point. I wouldn't use a caster Druid or Cleric without taking Monk like I wouldn't take a Sorcerer without Paladin or Blackguard and a Wizard without Bard or Rogue.<br><br>At any rate, even only 1 level of Bard or Rogue usually helps a lot if only for the skilldumps.<br><br>The deal with multiclassing is gaining the most amount of powerful bonuses with the least amount of levels, and trying to mix classes that require the same feats or stats so they complement each other's abilities. WIS synergy between Monk and Druid/Cleric is obvious as CHA synergy with Sorcerer and Blackguard/Paladin, those are easy choices to recognize why multiclassing is better.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/03/07 19:16</span></i></p>

Yes, multiclasses are always more powerful. However, I meant that casters aren't as bad as other classes when left pure. Just go for 38 levels, take Spell Penetration and hello! You are now a 40th level caster! Uhm... yes... you get the point <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

Hi guys,<br><br>Thanks for the input! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I understand the bonuses inherent in multiclassing and do have a few multiclass characters which i've completed the official campaigns with.<br><br>It's just that after playing a few online games with multiclass characters, i was wondering how a pure class build would fare.

Well, I say Elf is a bad choice for a non-DEX-based build, no idea why you do that, I hate it when people say because of roleplay, because that's like if you said you're using a fire sword because those look cool even though you are fighting fire elementals, it just doesn't make any strategic sense.<br><br>Overall, the race change won't be extremely dramatic or anything, so you should survive. SO, what help you need? for a Paladin take Divine Might and increase STR, you can buff up your CHA when you get the spells, you can increase CHA but don't waste too much or your AB will suck, take melee fighting feats such as Weapon Focus, Blind-Fight, Improved Critical, etc, there isn't much else to add... you can make the build and post it at the builds forum, or heck just here, then we'll criticize it for possible improvements.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/28/06 23:16:09 (GMT) -- Big Meph<br>Using the 2 ESF's in a dex based sneak build, <i>to me</i>, just looks like you're teasing your diabetic opponent with extra sugar on your whipcream covered chocolate mudcake.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Thax, while I agree with everything you say, there is one thing i dont agree with!  if that makes sense?<br><br>I have used elf many times and NOT added to dex at all.  There are many reasons to take a race vs stat bonus.  My elf cleric i would put dex at 12 though, like in the pal above, cuz that is all the dex bonus you get when wearing full plate!  The blanket statement to put a stat that you recieve a bonus in to 16 isnt truthful and is infact, wasteful of stat points when you only get 12 counting to ac anyway...  but other than that, keep up the good work! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 11/27/07 23:01 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I agree with avado, Storm of Vengeance rocks, it stuns great, it can deal heavy damage over time, and Evasion doesn't work against it, you should try it in your strategy as well, too bad it's conjura</div></blockquote>

What was just that? if you had 16 DEX you just wouldn't wear a full plate, that's obvious, and it's hardly the point. You take at least 16 on the stat your race improves <b>because you took that race for it</b>, not the other way around, if you don't want to take 16 DEX then don't take a race that icreases DEX.<br><br>You say you 12 DEX is enough, and I know it's true, so then why take Elf for? that only reduces your CON as far as stat modifiers, and he's not making a build that benefits from the other racial bonuses.<br><br>You can do with any race, but the idea is to make the build stronger than it is now and Elf gives no real benefits while other races do, the lack of taking the benefits is a penalty itself.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/04/07 20:34</span></i></p>

whoa guys, relax... no need to get all fired up...<br><br>i'm inclined to agree with Thax in that yes, maybe if you're not building a DEX based build, Elf might be a bad choice.<br><br>However, that kinds of defeats my purpose here coz I'd like to create a build that works, no matter the race, as the different builds available are all race-specific and I think some peeps might prefer other races. Another "excuse" (if you want to call it that...) is, well, i kinda grew up reading all sorts of fantasy novels, and sometimes the heroes don't really fit into the stereotypical depictions of the races and the classes they took, so that's what i'd like to do as well. I just started out with Elf mainly coz i'm partial to Elves.<br><br>so let's put all that aside and maybe you can suggest some different starting stats for the various races? Just keep in mind, class is more important than race. So i guess it'd be okay for a high-STR Elf rather than a DEX-based one.<br><br>Hopes this clarifies some stuff so we won't need to keep on debating this.<br><br>I'll be back soon to try to post a build for you guys to dissect.<br><br>Thanks guys!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Just a note, your listed AB is +12, but with a longsword it will be +13.<br><br>As for skills, I wouldn't leave Taunt out. As a Paladin, you will be focusing in CHA more or less, thus having a lower AB. Taunt helps you to get even with Fighters. <br>Considering you have a CHA bonus to saves due to Divine Grace, I'd skip Spellcraft and just cross-class Tumble. Of course, at level 20 it means only +2 AC, but at level 40 it means +4 AC, nothing to sneeze at.<br>_________________<br>"Hats off and applause to rogues and evolution"<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By rafa10pj on 12/05/07 11:50</span></i></p>

Taunt can lower an enemy's AC up to -6, and that's an effective +6 to your AB.<br>As for AoOs, you shouldn't care too much. You'll only lose your Dodge AC, which is Tumble AC and Divine Shield AC in this character, IIRC. Just don't try it when surrounded by heavy-hitting m0bs.

ermz... i'm no expert so can i just clarify?<br><br>Taunt only works on a single enemy at one time right? for 5 rounds IIRC?<br><br>But if i'm fighting low level mobs, i wouldn't really need it right? (kinda like overkill) and if i'm fighting high level mobs i can't use it either coz i'll be swarmed under? <br><br>I don't play much PvPs (i sux at them big time and my internet tends to lag) so i don't know much about whether it's effective there?<br><br>kinda unsure about this... help?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Coruvian on 12/06/07 11:25</span></i></p>

Just try it on high AC enemies, you'll see...<br>Let's get in some maths: say you needed a roll of 19 + your AB to hit an enemy. You stand the first two rounds swinging at the air, until you realize you have invested in Taunt. You Taunt him and your AC drops a few points, enough for your target to get one swing at you maybe. However, he AC has also dropped, but much more than yours, and now you only need a 13+AB to hit him. See how better your odds are now?<br><br>Also, <a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Taunt" target="_blank">Taunt</a> has the advantage that the effective AB you acquire doesn't count towards the +20 AB cap.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By rafa10pj on 12/06/07 11:41</span></i></p>

okay i've tried substituting Taunt for Spellcraft but it doesn't seem to work very well for me.<br><br>Out of 10 combat trials against various mobs (highest rating Easy), the Taunt skill don't make any difference against the ones which i miss consistently (my char still misses) and it leaves me very vulnerable to AoO (especially against creatures like the manticore). Am i doing something wrong? I've followed the training layout i've posted previously, aside from the substitution.<br><br>I've been using the Halls of Advanced Training Deluxe - HotU + SoU edition for the training. Is there any other mods which any of you would recommend? maybe one where u can select the mobs to fight?

Thanx for understanding sbte...<br><br>Actually i've read that particular entry in the NWNwikia... I think i kinda understand that... but i guess i phrased my question wrongly... just to make sure:<br><br>As stated in the wikia, i will need an enhancement to my weapon in order to bypass the damage reduction totally... failing that, i would have to do more damage than amount that will be soaked by the mob's damage reduction... correct?<br><br>My question is: if i do not have the weapon enhancement and i am still not able to deal sufficient damage to overcome the damage soaked, are there any alternatives? or is it just not possible?<br><br>why i'm asking is coz currently i am still using the basic items which can be found in the original OC, mostly items with the minimum bonuses in order to test out the build fully, rather than rely on equipment enhancements to get my char through it... <br><br>Yes, i know equipment does play a part in the build but i believe the build must be inherently strong enough to be able to hold its own without over-relying on the equipment... otherwise it won't be much of a build would it?<br><br>on a side note, taunt wouldn't make a difference right?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Coruvian on 12/07/07 08:00</span></i></p>

You have <i>some</i> alternatives, though not much and they all entail spellcasting. <br>Some Paladin spells offer weapon enhancements, such as Magic Weapon and Greater Magic Weapon. These will help you get over Damage Reduction, as well as elemental damage (unless the mummy also has elemental damage reduction, which I doubt). <br>Another alternative would be to take the Divine Might.<br>Taunt will not help at all.<br><br>As for testing modules, search the vault for the Pretty Good Character Creator or the Novice To Epic something something.

Well, you <b>can</b> take EDR, however, for an Elven pure Paladin, that's definitely a bad feat choice (pre-requisite is 21 CON, your other stats would suffer too much). You can't cast  Stoneskin, Greater Stoneskin, Premonition, or any other spell that gives DR since you can't use arcane scrolls as a Paladin.

Too overpowered? that term does not exist, it's never strong enough.<br><br>Hmmm, I say you take too much CHA, your character hits with STR and you kill in melee, so you should focus on hitting first, everything else is less important, I wouldn't take CHA higher than 18, so that you get at least a regular STR score and a decent AB.

Well, there's never an agreement on how much CHA a Paladin should take, but your STR needs to be at least about 26 if you intend to make a good meleer or your AB will be too low.<br><br>Feats...

I tried out your recommendations and it seems to work pretty well... i did make a slight modification though... i only took 5 levels of Great Strength (with all the stat increases, my STR came up to 26 exactly)... the other 2 levels i invested in Great Cleave and Overwhelming Critical since i was upping my Strength so much...<br><br>btw do i need Extra Turning?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Coruvian on 12/12/07 05:31</span></i></p>

You don't, extra turning gives you +3 turns per day, which becomes +3 Divine Might or Divine Shield per day, it's fine if you had too many feats to spare, but you don't, so it's unnecessary.<br><br>If you're taking Overwhelming Critical you should go take Devastating Critical already, however, you have no need to drop Great Strength for it, Overwhelming Critical and Devastating Critical available as Paladin Bonus feats, so just drop Epic Toughness for those, Great Cleave is not, so there's nothing to do about it.<br><br>If you take Overwhelming Critical as bonus feat (which should be at level 35 I think), that will bump your Great Strength V sooner, so you'll get your 25 STR score needed for Devastating Critical at level 36 and will be able to pick Devastating Critical at level 38 as bonus feat <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>Upping STR "so much" is also something that never happens, high STR scores are around 34 (17 initial + 10 by levels + Great Strength VII give you 34) and above 40 for Red Dragon Disciples (not the case, I know). The highest STR score is attained only with a Half-Orc and has a value of 37 (45 for RDDs) since there is no class that gives Great Strength as bonus feat.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/28/06 23:16:09 (GMT) -- Big Meph<br>Using the 2 ESF's in a dex based sneak build, <i>to me</i>, just looks like you're teasing your diabetic opponent with extra sugar on your whipcream covered chocolate mudcake.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/12/07 06:11</span></i></p>

so in this case, i can actually just make do with Overwhelming Crit and totally do away with Epic Toughness and pick up 2 more ranks of Great Strength instead....<br><br>on a side note, why isn't Epic Toughness useful? i would have thought that more HP = higher survivability, esp since AC &amp; SR can only be stretched so far... what's more 80 out of 489 is like 16% of ur life (figures based on the original draft, not the later one i tried with Overwhelming Crit and Great Strength)...<br><br>hmmz... what would be a good stat for a STR-based? and for a CHA-based? the uses of each?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Coruvian on 12/12/07 17:04</span></i></p>

Taking Overwhelming Critical is a big feat investment, so not taking Devastating Critical when you already meet all the requirements just sounds wrong, Devastating Critical is very powerful. If it's banned where you play then there's nothing to do, don't take it, but you can't just assume it is.<br><br>First of all, Toughness is better than Epic Toughness, Toughness gives +1 per level for +40 at level 40 and Epic Toughness gives only 20 each, so you <b>must</b> take Toughness before taking Epic Toughness.<br>Second, if you wanted HP so badly you'd change your race to Human to start with 14 CON and have an extra feat for Toughness pre-epic, that's +60 HP for being human over the Elf variant <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">   <br>Third, well, +20 HP per feat isn't impressive at all, that's about 1 hit or less, so even though it's useful to increase your HP, just about any other feat is better if you can pick something else, I might take Epic Toughness before maybe Epic Skill Focus, but most other feats like Epic Prowess, Epic Weapon Focus, Armor Skin, Overwhelming Critical or Great Strength are more important.<br>Last, if you want HP then make max rolls dude, 489 is not even a multiple of 10, so you obviously rolled your HP like it didn't matter, your HP with 12 CON and Epic Toughness V (as the build you made down there, but you must change one Epic Toughness for Toughness as I said above) should be 540, so you notice how rolling max your HP you can take off a pair of Epic Toughness feats and still end winning HP.<br><br>STR increases AB and damage, while CHA increases saves and damage/AC using Divine Might/Shield. The actual damage gained by STR is the same than CHA, the difference is Divine Might breaches DRs but the duration is low while STR is permanent, however, comparing AB versus AC is complicated, the increase in damage by Divine Might becomes useless without AB, and your AC won't become unreachable anyway, so in general terms I believe AB is most decisive, just try out both ways, you'll notice it's easier to kill when your AB is higher, but CHA should still be good enough to use Divine Might or Divine Shield when in trouble, since your Paladin can buff CHA, I consider 18 is about enough, but there is no fix value, in the end <b>you pick as much as you want</b>, I just advice you that not taking any STR at all will make so that your character won't hit.<br>_________________<br>Join the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Pre-epic Character Builds</a> Guild for builds capped at level 20 and level 30.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/12/07 18:32</span></i></p>

hmmz... makes sense...<br><br>i've went back to test out the feats tree though... although the Criticals are Paladin Bonus feats, i still had to take 5 ranks of Great Strength 1st which were not bonus feats... meaning the first 6 non-bonus feats had to go to Great Cleave and Great Strength first... However, before i can get Overwhelming Crit as 1 of the bonus feats, i end up having one bonus feat where my only available choices are Epic Toughness I or Epic Reputation (everything else has been taken)... is it worth getting Epic Reputation since i'm working on Taunt? or Epic Toughness?<br><br>i've just realized, if i don't take Devastating Crit, i'd probably wind up taking Epic Toughness II or Epic Reputation... doesn't seem that great a tradeoff... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_redface.gif"> <br><br>btw aside from Taunt and Spellcraft, any other skills is recommended? what about the Crafting skills? or Search?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Coruvian on 12/12/07 20:05</span></i></p>

I would take Epic Toughness over Epic Reputation, sure thing, I don't even know what Epic Reputation gives, I just know I don't like it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   taking Epic Toughness because there was nothing else happens a lot on Pure builds, check out the Pure Fighter, you can take lots of Epic Toughness and still have plenty of feats left <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>As for skills, I usually just take Discipline, Spellcraft and Tumble, perhaps Concentration, since you have a few short-term buffs like Holy Sword and failing a spell would be annoying, other than that are skills that aren't directly related to combat (since you're not a sneaker to be taking Hide and Move Silently).

Yeah well, I like this one better (you wouldn't tell right, after I was telling you what to do <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ).<br><br>Your HP is 500, not 389 (400 for 40 levels of d10 Paladin +40 Toughness +40 CON +20 Epic Toughness = 500), when posting builds, the rule goes that HP must be expressed as its max value, even if you don't really do it when you play, because when other people see your build at the forum the max value is the only accurate reference to understand how much HP the build has, so write the max value next time you post a build.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/28/06 23:16:09 (GMT) -- Big Meph<br>Using the 2 ESF's in a dex based sneak build, <i>to me</i>, just looks like you're teasing your diabetic opponent with extra sugar on your whipcream covered chocolate mudcake.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/13/07 17:51</span></i></p>

i've tried the various races... but it seems the Dwarf, Gnome and Halfling base stats would be 1 pt short which i've taken out from CHA... so instead of starting with CHA 15, i have CHA 14...<br><br>in this case, when i level up to 40 by following the build, without taking any feats for CHA, i end up at CHA 17... should i then substitute Toughness for 1 rank of Great Charisma to make it even?<br><br>and for the Human variant, i have an extra feat which i'm not sure what i should invest in? Great Strength, Great Charisma or Epic Toughness? or are there any other feats worth it?<br><br>the Half-Orc variant takes a pretty big hit when starting coz when all the other stats are set, CHA only comes up to 13... which makes the STR-based build the only viable one... in this case, should i invest more points in CHA? how much more (if any)?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Coruvian on 12/14/07 13:33</span></i></p>

I'd just thought it would be interesting... like i said, kinda like an experiment... coz like everyone seems to focus on multiclassing (and yes, i agree that multi-classing actually is probably better than having a pure class...) however multiclassing is probably more confusing that building a pure build coz there are so many different ways u can go about multi-classing, ergo people spent more time on it and there never seemed to be any worthy pure builds that anyone has tried...<br><br>so i kinda wondered what it'd be like to play a pure build... so i actually started off by looking for pure builds available to try out... didn't manage to find many... and those few i found were more or less limited to certain races or not heavy on details... Humans are all well and fine but i'm more of an Elven person...<br><br>does this makes sense to you?<br><br>anyway... why Elf?<br><br>aside from the fact that Elves appeal to me most (they're older, usually wiser and better trained... what more can i say?)... probably coz i've been re-reading my Dark Elf, Icewind Dale, Hunter's Blades, Dragonlance Chronicles, Legends etc etc trilogies lately... and i do have most of the 2nd, 3rd and 3.5 edition D&amp;D rulebooks... was flipping through and reading the entry on Corellon Larethion and found a mention of elven paladins but there didn't seem to be much info on them... so i looked in the Cormanthyr rulebook which also didn't mention much... so i thought i'd try it out here... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">       <br><br>and since while i'm at it, why limit myself to just elven? i'm sure someone out there might be interested to see how an halfling paladin would turn out... and since it's a fantasy setting, who knows? maybe there IS a halfling/gnome/half-orc paladin out there...<br><br>i'll be moving on to all the other classes once i've settled this one... maybe Sorceror for a change... maybe even going on to build Purest Prestige Class builds... hope u guys can help me through them... i'm not really a newbie (i've been playing NWN for about 3 yrs?) but i'm not good at it either (me low INT, low WIS)... and while i have the rulebooks, they apply more to the tabletop game than NWN...<br><br>oh... and i have a custom world (but only on tabletop)where my char is an elven paladin with an extensive backstory... in fact my custom world has maps, nations, histories, backstories, NPCs with full background, everything... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br>so that's probably another reason why elven paladin...<br><br>i think my explanation's kinda jumbled... hope u can make some sense out of it...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Coruvian on 12/14/07 14:20</span></i></p>

rafa:<br><br>sorry to disappoint but i did read that particular topic and the links contained therein... <br><br>like i said, most of the builds seemed limited to that 1 or 2 races... and they don't really explain why! why not alternatives? that's also why i've tried building one here... like the Paladin build by GhostNWN for example... i realize that my ending STR build is very much similar to his with the exception of Overwhelming &amp; Devastating Crit... it might not be better but it is DIFFERENT... we've managed to come up with a CHA build which is weaker than the STR one melee-wise... but could potentially do well against undead and could probably draw even with the STR build when fully buffed (after all, i did manage to get that Dracolich)... the other races would prob require variations on the build (as evidenced by the Dwarf and Half-Orc), not covered by that particular build by GhostNWN... <br><br>so there you have it... quite perfectionistic huh?<br><br>Thanx for pointing it out tho... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Coruvian on 12/14/07 20:22</span></i></p>

Why limited to one or two races? simple, because those are the best races. By the Way, if you try a Pure Dwarven defender of Arcane Archer your race choice is stuck.<br><br>Pure builds are on the searcher, that's for sure, in order to find Pure builds in the searcher you write that the character you're looking for must have from 40 to 40 levels of one class, if you look for it to have minimum 1 you get all choices and if you pick maximum 1 well you find no pure builds because you're asking for maximum 1 level and you want minimum 40 levels. I just checked it for the base classes: the searcher pops 2 Barbarians, 1 Bard, 2 Clerics, 1 Druid, 2 Fighters, 6 Monks, 1 Paladin, 2 Rangers, 2 Rogues, 0 Sorceres, 5 Wizards.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

I am all for Roleplaying but I dont think a thread is needed to provide builds for each class using every race. For one, most people who Roleplay there builds arent usually looking for other peoples builds to play and two, lets say that most people would agree a Human would be the best choice for a straight Paladin build. I believe that most people could just use the search engine for only 40 levels of Paladin and after looking over those builds could make there own adjustments based on Race to closely match what has already been done. I dont think the differences would be all that major looking at the whole picture. Sure you could say things like "it might be a better idea to focus on STR instead of CHA when using Dwarf or Half-Orc because of those Races penalty to CHA." Well, after all of that, I dont have a problem with what your doing. I enjoy playing straight class builds and also using races that most people wouldnt choose to do it. I'm just stating what I think most people would agree about this topic. I could be wrong.

Every build can be played with any race except DwD and AA, you usually only choose the most convenient one, that's why they are different, I would find boring to play the same build with all the races.<br><br>In fact, when you go through the builds you may notice that sometimes lack of originality is criticized, and I don't mean that the builder has no good ideas but rather that someone else already made the build before him (or extremely similar) and making it again makes it basically a copy, so in terms of indexing builds, having two equal builds isn't of much use. What happens is that just a change of race would probably won't be enough to consider one build different from the another, they're still copies, just a race adaptation, which is minimum change, perhaps you could end losing 1 or even 2 important stat modifiers when jumping from Human to Dwarf on a Paladin, but the build is still pretty much the same, same feats, same leveling, same combat abilities, same spells, same fighting strategies, only slight different stats, and hopefully a different setting each time, I don't find anything interesting in doing so, and I don't understand any reason in picking the races that don't benefit the most either.<br><br>I would care less if people start making their builds with all the races but the idea of posting each for every race is heavily unnecessary and not even related to a build being Pure or not, the original post didn't seem focused on all-race adaptation, rather, pure builds of all classes, I just brought the race topic when I suggested a change of race in the build to make it stronger, we should probably head back to the Pure build topic... I'm tired of the race topic.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.
