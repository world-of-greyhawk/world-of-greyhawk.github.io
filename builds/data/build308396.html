I love monk, then I decided to make a build having 20 levels of monk and another class to power up the char, well, it´s here. I actually use this build in the server I play, a mid to high magic server. It´s very respectable among the players, good in pvm and pvp.

No Epic Dodge when you're so close. Would you care to say why? What is your thought behind it?<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

To get ED you'd lose Monk 20 or ninth level spells. Still, so close yet so far.

Yeah grimmir, it´s a good point, I could up wis just to 18 and put the other points in dex, exchange 3 levels of cleric for shadow dancer and take epic dodge, with it i could have more chances to survive. This was a thing that I didn´t thought about when I made this char, a great upgrade to a version 2.0 . But even without epic dodge this char do a good job in the server that I play (kill all the boss, great opponent in pvp), and all of this in the level 32 against opponents 40. All this success blinded me about make some modifications to get epic dodge. Thank you!

The build is good as it is, it's almost impossible to go wrong with Monk-Clerics. And seeing as you have uncanny dodge, you might even survive High STR KD spammers with this, I'm not sure where your AC ends up.<br><br>In an environment with KD immunity, or a high magic setting, it might be good as it is. In a place where one easily can have mind immunity ED is a no brainer. In general though, I personally like ED better than both mind immunity and lvl 9 Cleric spells in a buffer. You only have to give one away, I'd think a split like Monk18/SD5/Cleric17 could be good. I've played one of those.<br><br>*edit* Going for SD5 will increase your AB one point too, but it will also cost an AC or spell duration. How good wouldn't this build be with 42 levels? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 04/27/09 06:16</span></i></p>

yeah grimmir, is a good choice monk 18/ cleric 17 / SD 5 but I prefer monk 20/ cleric 15 / SD 5, just because I LOVE the glowing eyes of the monk!!!!! <br><br>The duration of the buffs with cleric 17 isn´t problem due to extend spell.
