Alright I am on a server that has very strict class choices, soo it is really hard to find a good build. The classes that I can be are fighter, ranger, rogue. monk, and barbarian. (there is also sorcerer but i do not want that class).<br><br>        I can also have one prestige class, I would like it to be weapon master because what ever weapon you specialize in you get the best of that in the game.<br><br>        There is no dev critical too.<br><br>        I also prefer Greatsword as weapon of choice, but I can live with a different weapon.<br><br>        Oh ya and finally, please send me a link to the level up guide I am not good with making my own.<br><br>                                                                        -Thanks<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Monk9292 on 07/20/07 23:23</span></i></p>

It's difficult to say without knowing specifics. Don't even know if it's pvp or not, and you might have more luck with the following general ideas than going on the advice of some outsider with little diversity like me on the finer points of builds. <br><br>Take improved KD if there are no immunity items and you can be reasonably succesful with it.<br><br>If it's a low ac and high ab setting, then intiative feats, blooded and thug will help you hit before you get hit. If mages and other DC related nastiness could be a problem then I suggest you replace those rogue levels with bard and take spellcraft to help saves vs spells. Might still need save feats to help though. <br><br>Otherwise 3 rogue is good for a bit more damage, evasion and UMD, but if the flame arrow spells will be a problem then epic fire resistance will absorb a lot of damage, something like 90 or more fire damage from a level 36 flame arrow maximised
