That said, I will start with the pale master. I have made various changes to this build to make it over-all much better. HP will be significantly lower, but offense will be much better. For the Pale Master, early corrections will be in bold, however almost all of the epic portion has been changed. For all other builds, I will bold everything I have changed. I am also going to make various other small changes to meet Torias' criteria.<br><br><br>    Quote: Posted 01/24/04 19:36:21 (GMT) by Lockindal<br><br>    Concept: A passive warrior who is fascinated by the undead and the arcane weave and fights with skill.<br><br><br>    Alignment: I reccomend True Neutral for this type of build. Very passive, cares only for the affiliation with the undead and the love of fighting.<br><br>    Ideal Purpose: To look cool, to deal decent physical and magic damage, and to be able to stand up for itself.<br><br>    Title: "Undead Gladiator" (I ripped this off of another thread, I couldn't think of a better title. This title fits this build perfectly.)<br><br>    End Result: Human Fighter 14 / Wizard 10 (Suggestion: Illusionist or Generalist. Do NOT do Necromancer; the loss of True Strike will hurt too much. Pale Master is what represents this characters' love of undead, not the spell school he "focuses" on. In PnP, you can CHOOSE which school(s) you lose.) / Pale Master 16 (I would do fighter 16 / wiz 8 / pm 16, but that doesn't get level 9 spells (8+8 = 16)<br><br>    Level One Stats:<br><br>    16 STR (+3)<br>    15 DEX (+2)<br>    10 CON (+0)<br>    16 INT (+3)<br>    8 WIS (-1)<br>    8 CHA (-1)<br><br>    (note: I changed the stats it gets along the way. Please note.)<br><br><br>    Familiar: Choose the pixie, to pick locks and such. This is mostly taste, unless you pick the pixie. Your familiar will never be anything to drool over, albeit useful early on if you pick something other than Pixie.<br><br>    Stuff that makes this build: Level nine spells eventually, the following epic spells: Epic Warding, Hellball, Greater Ruin, Epic Mage Armor. Six attacks per round with no buffs (4+2), 28 AC innate.<br><br>    Strategies early on: Wear full plate mostly, take it off to buff, then put it back on. Around level 16 you will want to stop doing this, as when you buff up your dex with spells &amp; items, you're much better off with a low spell failure armor (or even AC: 0)<br><br>    Why the Double Sword?: Well, at the cost of one feat, you get NO bab penalty for having "two medium weapons" you only have to cast ONE keen edge, you only have to cast ONE flame weapon, etc. You also look like a mage, because the double sword looks like a staff-sword.<br><br>    SKILLS: Tumble (cross-skill; up to 20 ranks), Persuade (Pale Master; up to 42 ranks), Discipline (Fighter; up to 43 ranks), Spellcraft (Wizard/Pale Master; up to 42 ranks), Concentration (all), Craft Weapon (all; up to 15 ranks), Craft Armor (all; up to 15 ranks), Listen (Pale Master; up to the max you can.)<br><br>    Human<br>    -------<br><br>    Fighter 1 - Light-&gt;Heavy Armor Prof, Shield Prof, Toughness, Weapon Prof: Exotic, Two-Weapon Fighting.<br><br>    Fighter 1, Wizard 1 - Familiar, Scribe Scroll.<br><br>    Fighter 1, Wizard 2 - Ambidexterity<br><br>    Fighter 2, Wizard 2 - *STR up (17)* Knockdown<br><br>    Fighter 2, Wizard 3 - Nothing<br><br>    Fighter 2, Wizard 4 - Weapon Focus: Two-Bladed Sword<br><br>    Fighter 2, Wizard 4, Pale Master 1 - Bone Skin (+2 AC)<br><br>    Fighter 2, Wizard 4, Pale Master 2 - *Str up (18)* Animate Dead.<br><br>    Fighter 3, Wizard 4, Pale Master 2 - Blind-Fight<br><br>    Fighter 4, Wizard 4, Pale Master 2 - Weapon Specialization: Two-Bladed Sword<br><br>    Fighter 4, Wizard 4, Pale Master 3 - Darkvision<br><br>    Fighter 4, Wizard 4, Pale Master 4 - *Str up (19)* Improved Critical: Two-Bladed Sword, Summon Undead, +2 AC.<br><br>    Fighter 6, Wizard 4, Pale Master 4 - Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br><br>    Fighter 7, Wizard 4, Pale Master 4 - Extend Spell<br><br>    Fighter 8, Wizard 4, Pale Master 4 - *Str up (20)* Improved Knockdown<br><br>    Fighter 10, Wizard 4, Pale Master 4 - Power Attack, Cleave<br><br>    Fighter 12, Wizard 4, Pale Master 4 - *Str up (21)* Great Cleave<br><br>    End BAB: 16.

As an aside, I wish Bioware would make the Greater Bodak the level 16 summon; the Ghoul King is a *Major* DOWNGRADE from the Greater Bodak. -.-<br><br>    You will have to learn most of your spells off of scrolls.<br><br>    I suppose I should explain more about this build. Feel free to replace knockdown/improved knockdown with disarm/improved disarm if you wish. This build is very flexible, and has a lot of feats to burn. It has many abilities, a lot of spells, immunities, and tons of AC. BUTT NAKED it has 28 AC. That's a whole lot. You can easily push this character's AC to extreme heights. With Mage Armor / Epic Mage Armor, you get +5 ac on every type and +6 on dodge. You will be able to fight much better than most other pale master builds, as you actually have the attacks per round in addition to weapon specialization so you don't rely on critical hits (which many creatures are immune to in the first place.) Your health will be pretty decent, but no dwarven defender. This build can also use many strategies, such as using Greater Shadow Conjuration: Web, then dropping a hellball<br><br>    You can cast Epic Warding and have a ton of health effectively. That's a lot. You're immune to critical hits, stuns, etc. You're basically a demi-god.<br><br>    Have fun.<br><br>    ~ Lock.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 19:55</span></i></p>

You'd have to drop those too.  And also, this build doesn't really have any offensive spell capabilities.  It's meant to be a pre-battle buffer, so you can always take off your armor, buff up, and then you're good until next rest.  Additionally, if you are able to pump your dex up to the max with items and spells, you would actually have the same AC with padded armor as you would with full plate.<br><br>Steve

You get the spell slots, just no new spells. You can still fill them up with metamagic spells however.

Whether it is a bug or just the way Bioware implented it, I don't know.  The trick to taking Palemaster with Bards and Sorcerors is that you want to chase, or follow, the PM levels with the caster levels.

The problem comes from the coding of how spells are learned. Currently like griz said wizards can learn spells from scribing, where as sorcerers and bards only learn spells on those class levels. The palemaster coding only raises the caster level. It doesn't have any spell learning triggers.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>
