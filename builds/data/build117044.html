It should have this amount in each: AE (43), D (21), H (43), MS (43), S (42), and T (41) by the time you are in level 40.<br><br>To achieve that amount, you must put skill point into the class skill every time you get chance to. For example, if you were in druid and want to increase Discipline, don’t do that. Do that when you are in Monk level.<br><br>In addition to that, you will want to hold at least 57 or so points by the time you are at level 37 because you will need that points to max out the Hide, Move Silently, Tumble at level 38. When you maxed out those three skills, use the remaining points and put them into Discipline, you should have 21 points for that part.<br><br>Final Stats (BARE):<br><br>STR: 12<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 10<br>INT: 12<br>WIS: 31<br>CHA: 10<br><br>AC: 32<br>HP: 328/328<br><br>Attack Bonus: +25/+22/+19/+16/+13<br>Damage: 1-10+1(critical: 20/*2)<br>Fortitude: 24<br>Reflex: 24<br>Will: 32<br>Base Attack: 24<br><br>In Dragon Form (BARE):<br><br>STR: 48<br>DEX: 36<br>CON: 32<br>INT: 12<br>WIS: 31<br>CHA: 10<br><br>AC: 64<br>HP: 868/768(Temporary Hit points)<br><br>Attack Bonus: +43/+40/+37/+34/+31<br>Fortitude: 35<br>Reflex: 36<br>Will: 32<br>Base Attack: 24<br>Spell Resistance: 20<br><br>There was one thing that I noticed in this form, the skills point also increases! It is amazing…. I think this would make this build very tough.<br>Discipline: 40<br>Hide: 56<br>Move Silently: 56<br>Tumble: 54<br><br>In Dragon Form (Using Enchanted Equipment)<br><br>Before transforming: AC: 54<br>AC: 67<br><br>To get that AC, you have to equip Bracer of Armor +10 and Cloak of Protection. But, you can boost that number even farther with druid spells and better enchantments (+12). If this were to be used in MP, if you have wizard in your group, I would assume that you can boost it even more, but I haven’t tried it yet in the MP.<br><br>To achieve the dragon form, you will have to do the exactly what I did above, because when I got to level 39 or so by doing something different, I ended up without dragon shape. Then I had to go back to level 30ish or so and took all druid level except level 38 and it worked then. Also, the character has challenge rating of challenging, which might change when you buff yourself up.<br><br>I hope you all like this build!<br><br>Anuis<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 11/03/05 21:24</span></i></p>

You only need 14 Druid. The prereqs listed int he manual, Grimoire and in-game (IIRC) are wrong. You only need Wildshape 5x/day (which you get at Druid 14).<br><br>I think you only get 3 shifts to dragon per day though. (I could be wrong there, as I never play Druids, but I seem to recall building one with Dragon Shape in a leveller and only getting 3 uses per day).<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> ... nah, it' cool... the Grimoire isn't right ALL the time. I think that using Wildshapes would be better. But then when you get Infinite you could just bust out Dragon Form at will... guess the Gods don't want that (you can beat just about anything in those 3 forms that Bioware has in the game) So I understand. I guess.
