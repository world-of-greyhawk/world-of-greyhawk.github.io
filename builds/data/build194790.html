With Improved Expertise and Monk AC, elemental forms can approach 70 AC with elemental buffs.  With a 15 damage reduction on top of that, this makes for a great tank even in improved wildshape form.  Attack bonus is 6 attacks and decent AB.  This particular build is a late bloomer however.  But, all-in-all, a very defensive build, but it is a late bloomer.<br><br>Comments please?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 20:43</span></i></p>

have you ever seen the druid 5/ shifter 17/ DD 18 build.. worth looking up...<br><br>i would like to point out that to a certain degree AC is mutualy exclusive with damage resistance...<br>not totaly, because you have elemental damage, but mostly.

Not terrible, but for a high level druid the WIS is a bit low - better spellcasting than a druid/shifter but with the shifter construct shape you would do better and you would get DR in shifted form anyway.<br><br>A note on you posting style, remember to post levels in the title and I personally I'd like to not have the class feats listed in the build, it looks messy.

Thanks for the posting tips.  Newbie poster here.  <br><br>I am purposely avoiding shifters; don't like em.  I have decided that I will take 16 druid 4 DD pre-epic to get elemental shape earlier.  As I stated, this is a late bloomer.  The ultimate point is to maximize the Slaad form (9th level shapechange spell) and improved water elemental.

The Deathslaad spell form seems to have better stats than the outsider shape form (except ac)! Never noticed that before.

shape shift spells are ok, but dont forget they are overall weaker than the shifter forms, and they CAN and WILL be dispelled.
