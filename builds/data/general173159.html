Hi,<br><br>On my PW I have a cleric that was trying to buff up a party member's two kukris. I was casting Greater Enchanted Weapon and Darkfire, but each time I cast the spell I saw a little text saying something like "Spell failed - must be cast on melee weapon or character holding melee weapon".<br><br>Is this specific to my PW or are kukris un-buffable everywhere since they're tiny weapons?<br><br>Thanks,<br>K.

Kukri's are very definitely buffable.  On the PW I play (and the SP mods I play); I usually buff my kukri's up with flame and grtr weapon.  HOWEVER; a lot of the CEP weapons cannot be buffed, due to using different base weapon types.  This could be a CEP weapon using an odd base type.

Hmm interesting. That's what I figured. Ok, I'll go pester the PW Creator about this then.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban

When you use spells like Darkfire and Magic weapon to buff, they only affect the weapon in your primary hand. They won't buff both weapons.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

It's a CEP PW so maybe that's the ticket.<br><br>Kaliban.
