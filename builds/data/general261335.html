In what order do Resistance and Immunity get applied?<br><br>For example, if I use my freatsword to hit someone who has 10/- slashing resistance and 50% slashing immunity, and I would normally do 30 damage, will I hit for (30-10)*50% = 10 damage or for 30*50%-10 = 5 damage?<br><br>Also, how does resistance stack? For example, if my opponent has 10/- slashing resistance and 10/- 'normal' damage resistance, and I hit him again for 30 damage, will the resistances stack and make me do 10 damage, or will they not stack and allow 20 damage to pass?

So you would only take 10 damage.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 12/21/06 19:37</span></i></p>

The stronger resistance applies as far as I know. Example, this might not be the exact same thing, but if you have a DR of let's suppose 20/- and another one of 10/+10 and you get hit for 50 damage with a +5 enhacement, the strong DR will make so that you don't recieve the first 20 damage, but 10/+10 won't do a thing, the stronger reduction already took more than what the weaker could've.<br><br>If DRs stacked easily you'd see a lot of more DWD dragons, and they would be untouchable on low magical servers, but it simply doesn't works like that. I'm not sure if it would stack on two different types of damage, but I doubt it.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/21/06 21:49</span></i></p>

So yes, they would stack.  You would only do 10 damage with a slashing weapon.

Ok I see.<br><br>And immunity/resistance/reduction from different sources doesn't stack right? Like DwD reduction doesn't stack with items or spells that give reduction? But it does stack with Resistance. And the same with resistance and immunity?
