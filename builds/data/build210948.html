Well I don't know if anyone has been crazy enough to try a build like this before...but here we go! The basic premise behind this build was to have a character with awesome damage reduction, epic dodge &amp; perfect health for thrown in good measure! Now this does put a horrendous strain on the feats &amp; ability bonuses so leaves him a little underpowered in certain areas but I would certainly appreciate any ways of improving the build without sacrificing the above three goals...<br><br>In fact a quick search using the Pulse Cap search engine does give a build with the same class levels but that is sooo completely different...<br><br>So I hope you've all got you're seatbelts on and get ready for the wild ride!!!<br><br>PLEASE NOTE: you would be absolutely crazy to play this from level 1 all the way up to 40, however I'm gonna have to give it a go!!!<br><br>Classes:<br><br>Fighter - 8<br>Rogue - 14<br>Dwarven Defender - 18<br><br>Race - Dwarf (duh)<br>Alignment - Any Lawful (LE would go with the dodgy part tho!)<br><br>Starting Stats (finishing stats) :<br><br>Str-8 (8)<br>Dex-17 (26)<br>Con-19 (26)<br>Int-12 (12)<br>Wis-8 (8)<br>Cha-6 (6)<br><br>Levelling Up:<br><br>1-10 Rogue - Weapon Finesse, Dodge, Toughness, Weapon Focus (Handaxe), Improved Evasion, +2 Dex<br><br>11-20 Dwarven Defender - Great Fortitude, Improved Critical, Blind Fight*, +2 Dex, +1 Con<br><br>21-28 Fighter - Great Constitution I/II/III, Epic Weapon Focus (Handaxe), Epic Damage Reduction I/II, Weapon Specialisation (Handaxe), Epic Weapon Specialisation (Handaxe), +1 Con, +1 Dex<br><br>29-36 Dwarven Defender - Great Constitution IV/V, Epic Damage Reduction III, Great Dexterity I, Perfect Health, +2 Dex<br><br>37-40 Rogue - Improved Evasion, Epic Dodge, +40 Tumble (at level 37)<br><br>Well I hope that's possible to follow! I don't like those really long lists that go into way too much detail! Where possible I have listed the feats in order they should be taken!<br><br>This leaves u with 191 skill points to spend as you see fit, I usually max tumble and UMD with the rest going on whatever is best suited to the world I am playing in (set trap, open lock, pick pocket...etc...)<br><br>Finishing Attack Bonus (with non-magical handaxe)<br><br>+38/+33/+28/+23 (hope this is correct, taken from the CBC252 excel spreadsheet...27 BAB, +8 dex, +3 wf/ewf so should be!!!)<br><br>Saving Throws:<br><br>Fortitude : 30<br>Reflex : 19<br>Will : 28<br><br>Hit Points : 740 (maxed <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  )<br><br>Damage Reduction : 21/-<br><br>Immunities : Poison &amp; Disease<br><br>AC : 18 (pretty shabby really, with tower shield would be better!)<br><br>So there we go...I hope I haven't scared anyone with the build!

If Dodge and Weapon Finesse were swopped around and that 2nd Improved Evasion was actually Defensive Roll it should work. I think I'd give him Set Traps as that would give him a way besides UMD to damage Sneak immune foes but he looks quite playable 1-40.<br>Why Perfect Health though? That and Planar Turning are far too difficult to get for the benefit they give.<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

I like this combination.<br><br>Not a big thing I suppose, but have you considered going R8/F4/DD8 pre-epic to get the weapon spec. earlier and a slightly better BAB to help in the leveling.  Also, Have you considered R13/F5/DD 22.  You can still probably manage your epic dodge requirements and epic weapon spec with an additional DD bonus feat/Damage reduction I think.  Just an idea.<br><br><br><br>Drallimer<br><br>P.S.

The reason is you don't get it until level 36 of your build anyway and the cost is terribly steep for the little benefit it actually bestows. How many times do you think you'll be poisoned or diseased before then? And what would you do about it then? I'd suggest dropping a few skill points into the Heal skill and use healing kits to cure the disease/poison. This could free up some points to shift from CON to DEX to get your AB and AC up.

I like the class combo. I don't think I've seen to many rogue DD builds. Only thing I see isn't really a build issue, but a preference thing, and that is why hand axe? Was it to keep in RP theme? If so a battle axe would suit just as well and put out more damage. Otherwise maybe a warhammer or something if you want to go with a shield, or even look into good old standbye great swords.

Ok, I can understand the finesse point, but why not use short sword then? Is this designed around an RP theme for dwarves? If so I can also understand that weapon choice. I did a DD build where I picked hand axe solely for rp reasons.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

It's nice for dual-wielding dex based weapon masters for example.  But for this build, crits aren't honestly important one way or another, as sneak damage isn't multiplied in a critical.  I don't think either short sword or handaxe would really make much difference.  But his AB probably isn't going to allow for much of a crit range to be useful anyway, so perhaps going for high multiplier  (handaxe) over high range (short sword) would be better.<br><br>Steve

I understand potential reasons.

Well at the end of the day the finesseable weapon doesn't really matter, short-sword/handaxe...rapier could have been an even better choice with the higher critical range...<br><br>I guess the reason is part role-playing (Dwarves - axe), part to be a little different <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  I never really ever see anyone running around with a handaxe...tho this stocky little dwarf with a huge tower shield and a tiny axe looks pretty silly indeed!!!<br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!
