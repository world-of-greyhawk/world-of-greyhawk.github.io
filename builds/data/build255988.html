I haven't taken a very good look at it yet, but at first glance I'd suggest this:<br><br>Drop starting STR by one and raise CON by two. Then take +STR at level 8 in stead of +DEX.<br><br>You'll end up with the same STR, +2CON, and -1DEX. The -1DEX won't hurt you since you can wear Full Plate armor, and you only need 15 for Ambidexterity and ITWF anyway.<br><br>You'll end up with the same DMG, AB, and AC, but with 40 more HP and a higher Fort save. You'll also lose 1 Ref save, but since that's your highest save and you've got Improved Evasion anyway you'll hardly notice it.<br><br><br>Also I'm no fan of using two different weapons, and using two Daggers, Shortswords or Rapiers will free up a bunch of feats. But I guess that choice was for style points, not pure effectvity. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

Ok, my mind just blows at the idea of focuses and dev crit on two weapons, but have it your way.<br><br>Drop Fighter 27 for Bard 4, you'll get one more song per day and better chances for skilldumping at the expense of only 4 HP, Bard 1 should be taken at levels 7, 12 or 17 for a better skilldumping, as well as Bard levels 2, 3 and 4 at levels 22, 27, 32 or 37, also for better skilldumping.<br><br>You know, that amount of Fighter is way too high, I see you need it for feats on two weapons, but at least drop it to 24, as Epic Toughness is not worth it, with that change you can get Bard 6, which will get you more and better songs, remember to skilldump.<br><br>You're not getting Spellcraft, which is a Bard class skill, it's a useful skill so you should seriously get it as a main skill everytime you can.<br><br>An odd build, not much to my taste, but keep it up.

thank you thank you!  I thought this build was basically dead <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>As to the inputs, all excellent thanks.  the build was really for a specific purpose; mainly the dual wielding Long and short with Dev Crit...  it wasn't my Idea, but i thought I saw a way to possibly make it work better <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>I like the ideas though, so I will look at changes when I get home and post an update.<br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world
