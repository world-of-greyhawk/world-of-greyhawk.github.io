I just checked out Fernandoa's arcane archer/bard/rdd build, which is pretty sweet (57 AB to 53 AB here, 33 AC to 36 AC here).  And he dev crits.  Which is nice.  And can carry a lot more stuff. <br><br>I think this build has a few advantages to that build (to weigh against some of the obvious disadvantages, like strength (mighty) and AB): <br><br>1. Level 1-4 wizard spells are nice.  There is this one particular spell, you might have heard of it, TRUE STRIKE, that can really be useful in PvP.  On a scroll or wand.  improved invisibility and stoneskin have also got to rank in the "really useful" category of spells.  And he can craft wands for all of the spells he knows.<br>2. In melee, this build gets six attacks with AB starting at 41.  not susceptible at all to disarm.<br>3. The monk abilities and immunities, plus monk speed.<br>4. No experience penalty for an elf, who gets modal detect, longbow as a elf class weapon, +2 to listen and spot, and about 800 years of life more than a halfelf.<br>5. The +12 ability bonus cap.  It means this build can add 12 to wisdom for a +6 ac bonus and to dexterity for a +6 ac and AB bonus.  Add +12 to the bard/rdd/aa and you have an unnecessarily wise archer.  Add intelligence and ditto; here, you get more spells, at least up to +4 of the bonus.  Of course, adding charisma doesn't do a thing for this build but doesn't do much for the bard/rdd/aa either.  Since most bows cap out at +5 or +10 for mighty (or even lower), any strength over the mighty cap is wasted.  Not a concern for this build; any strenght-enhancing equipment goes straight to damage (and the ability to carry stuff). <br><br>So it's got that going for it.<br><br>-_^

For comparing multiple builds it's more effective to put a link to another build in this thread rather than going to the other builder's thread and posting a 'bump' note of no importance to that build.<br><br>(Tonight I started reading that thread and had no idea what your post was about at the bottom of Fern's build until I made my way to this thread.)<br><br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br><i>"Where there is life, there is hope." - Grover</i>

I think he is talking about this build. I posted it in the general nwn forum for a guy who wanted a dev critting archer. Anyway, I dont like dev critting archers, that is why I didnt post it here, and I think he has been done to death. I think he could be tweaked as I did it really fast to post it and forget.<br><br>-Edit: I have been reading the comments, I think there is a bit of a mess between my solid archer <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "198047", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> (BTW. His AB could be a bit higher by dropping toughness for epic prowess, I didnt realize it when I was building it at first time)  and this one. They are very different animals. Have fun.

hmm, ya, linking would have been better. particularly if it was to the right build.  <br><br>thanks, fern -- it's a sweet build.  53 is a good ab.  the monk abilities and the wizards spells and scrolls, particularly crafted to wand, are the highlights to my build.

I just realized that if you take monk to 10, you raise your AC (monk +2) at no expense to AB because the AA bonuses to AB come on odd levels.  No feats are lost, either, and you pick up the level 10 Ki Strike (not all that useful but not useless).

And it allows you to get improved evasion much earlier - level 21, if you like (not pre-epic because would affect your AB) and still max out your monk skills (tumble and discipline) at level 40.
