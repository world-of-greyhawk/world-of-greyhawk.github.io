<b>Playable from level 1 - 40  ..PvM Build</b><br><br>Harvester of War is an excellent build since the rakshasha stuff is based off your druid casting lvls and keeping it semi high allows for a lot more punch to your spells. I doubt most other shifters could get what he had, unlimited maximized ice storms.<br><br>I noticed actually, if you cast empowered ice storms, you tend to do more damage. This is due to the fact, you get an infinite amount, so eventually you do pass up the maximized version. That, and it comes at 15th instead of 17th lvl druid, which could make a difference. But you could change the combat casting to empower spell with very little fuss.<br><br>Only critiques (not problem) I have about that build is improved knockdown is kinda handy for the very low AB shifter when you need a boost, or improved expertise, though defensive stance somewhat makes up for it, defensive stance isnt unlimited. But I guess that's the fun, you can fall back on nukes, while my tank defender/shifter just tries to vainly hit things.<br><br>Finally, here's my defender/wizard/rogue firestar, mostly built for optimal lvling, faster dmg reduction, and epic warding at 31.<br><br>pre-epic<br>wizard 14, then defender 6<br>stats:<br>str 12<br>dex 14<br>con 18+3 from lvls<br>wis 8<br>int 16+2 from lvls<br>cha 6<br><br>feats, 7 dwarf, 2 wizard (in no particular order, just take dodge/toughness before 12th): dodge, toughness, spell penetration, greater spell penetration, extend spell, still spell, empower spell, spell focus, greater spell focus.<br><br>epic<br>21: wizard 15, epic dmg reduction, great int 1 (int 19)<br>22: wiz 16<br>23: wiz 17<br>24: +1 int, wiz 18, auto still spell 1 (int 20)<br>25: wiz 19<br>26: wiz 20, auto still spell 2<br>27: wiz 21, auto still spell 3.<br>28: int +1, rogue 1, max skills (int 21)<br>29: rogue 2, evasion<br>30: wiz 22, epic spell (hellball or ruin or mage armor)<br>31: wiz 23, epic warding.<br>32: +1 int, def 7 (int 22)<br>33: def 8, dmg reduc 2<br>34: def 9<br>35: def 10 (dmg reduc at 12/-)<br>36: int +1, def 11 (23 int), epic spell penetration<br>37: def 12<br>38: def 13<br>39: rogue 3, epic spell focus.<br>40: +1 int, def 14, epic dmg reduc 3 (18/-), (int 24)<br><br>You can swap around the rogue lvls, and such, but I found most of the time, I'd rather be a great picker and have evasion around mid-epic, than wait til the end.<br><br>You can also lower defender lvls without too much fuss. The whole premise is to take a little bit of damage, and then use warding when you get in trouble.<br><br>You can also use all the int+ except the first one, for +con. Basically, 26 con base, instead of 21 con base. This is because your int is never that high, so you would always use no saver spells like bigby or the shield spells or IGMS anyhow so gaining a few more spells vs that hp boost is more appealing.<br><br>In the end you may look like:<br>23 x 4 = 92<br>8 x 40 con = 320<br>toughness 40<br>14 x 12 = 168<br>6 x 3 = 18<br>---<br>638 base hp with buffs you could reach 718 or so with a good roll on empowered endurance.<br><br>Ac gets pretty high with mage armor, and all your buffs like shadow shield, shield spell, and even mage armor for 1 more dodge AC. Not to mention, self cast hastes.<br><br>This build isn't the best at anything, but certainly a lot of fun I felt, you get things to look forward to like epic mage spells, dmg reduction, and of course, rogues really can't keep up with a fully buffed up wizard for searching out traps, and the +2 dwarf in indoor areas helps too.<br><br>The ftr 10/wm 7/wizard 23 tends to be more people's style recently I noticed, the hack em up, and nuke em up builds, but without warding or dmg reduction, they tend to die pretty fast I noticed. Can't be the best tanker, but you come pretty dang close with all your buffs you can lay on as a mage.<br>_________________<br>I may not be able to get an erection, but at least I have enough balls not to hack.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 04/30/05 16:54</span></i></p>
