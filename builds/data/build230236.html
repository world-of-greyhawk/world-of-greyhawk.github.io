You must take off armor and buff a little, including Ultravision. Then you can use Darkness in combat even in plate  to generate Sneaks and defend against spellcasters. You have an epic summon and an undead to help distract, and use KD for sneaks. You have 9 uses of turn undead for divine might/shield. Bard song is +2 AB and damage, +1 saves, +8 hp and +1 skill. The UMD should if nothing else allow the use of scrolls.<br><br>Smiting is +6 AB and +30 dmg once a day.<br><br>This is more than a pure build IMO, because nothing is gained from having lvl 29 and 30 Blackguard, so two more bard levels should be taken Epic to improve this char, for +4 to AC and Saves vs spells. You must perhaps take 2 points from CON into INT to make it happen.<br><br>Not sure what spells you can use in armor, but Darkness at least, and of course your Bard song. Not sure where it is smart to split the CHA/STR, but i eneded on this result, which I feel is somewhat balanced.<br><br>Extra Smiting is probably not to useful, you might switch it for IC. Even Lingering song would appear on my wishlist.<br><br>It is a little feat starved at least pre-epic, but Bard makes it more versatile than  fighter does anyhow.<br><br>Hm, i have really found my muse these last few weeks.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.
