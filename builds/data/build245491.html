He uses a two-bladed sword, because I like that weapon, or else take a double axe, but two weapons is what I mean, double weapons are very strong, the extra APR increases damage very well specially with damage additions like EWS (or Darkfire, Divine Might, not the case), but double weapons aren't as good to pierce DRs, and that's why he needs a strong weapon, his DR and HP will cover the lack of high AC.<br><br>Palayable Leveles 1-40<br><br>PvP and PvM<br><br>Alignment: Any Non-Lawful (1-19) -&gt; Any Lawful (20-39) -&gt; Any Non-Lawful(39-40)<br><br>Dwarf<br><br>Abilities:<br>STR 16 (24) [32]<br>DEX 15<br>CON 18 (22) [32]<br>WIS 8<br>INT 10<br>CHA 6<br><br>1 Fighter1 - Weapon Proficiency: Exotic, Ambidexterity<br>2 Fighter2 - Two Weapon Fighting<br>3 Fighter3 - Weapon Focus: Two-bladed sword<br>4 Fighter4 - STR +1 (17), Weapon Specialization: Two-bladed sword<br>5 Fighter5<br>6 Barbarian1 - Toughness<br>7 Barbarian2<br>8 Barbarian3 - STR +1 (18)<br>9 Barbarian4 - Improved Two Weapon Fighting<br>10 Barbarian5<br>11 Barbarian6<br>12 Barbarian7 - CON +1 (19), Improved Critical: Two-bladed sword<br>13 Barbarian8<br>14 Barbarian9<br>15 Barbarian10 - Blind-Fight<br>16 Barbarian11 - CON +1 (20)<br>17 Barbarian12<br>18 Barbarian13 - Dodge<br>19 Barbarian14<br>20 Dwarven Defender1 - CON +1 (21)<br>21 Fighter6 - Epic Weapon Focus: Two-bladed sword, Epic Weapon Specialization: Two-bladed sword<br>22 Dwarven Defender2<br>23 Dwarven Defender3<br>24 Dwarven Defender4 - STR +1 (19) Epic Damage Reduction I<br>25 Dwarven Defender5<br>26 Dwarven Defender6<br>27 Dwarven Defender7 - Epic Damage Reduction II<br>28 Dwarven Defender8 - STR +1 (20)<br>29 Dwarven Defender9<br>30 Dwarven Defender10 - Epic Damage Reduction III<br>31 Dwarven Defender11<br>32 Dwarven Defender12 - STR +1 (21)<br>33 Dwarven Defender13 - Great Strength I (22)<br>34 Dwarven Defender14 - Epic Prowess<br>35 Dwarven Defender15<br>36 Dwarven Defender16 - STR +1 (23) Great Strength II (24)<br>37 Dwarven defender17<br>38 Dwarven Defender18 - Armor Skin<br>39 Barbarian15 - Terrifying Rage<br>40 Barbarian16 - CON +1 (22)<br><br>I could be tempted to change something for Knockdown, but he's short on feats due to the double weapon, which I won't give up.

Hey, Thax - nice build. Terrifying, actually <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">           <br><br>KD, might consider that instead of toughness; your HPs are already good (very, very, very good actually, way over 500 (nice) - KD would seem to serve you better; other thoughts - drop a little con for strength, to get your unbuffed ab to 40 (or more). You've defensive stance &amp; greater rage, so can afford to drop some for an AB boost, yes? This one's a possibility, just a thought: re, saves; I know, the class suffers in this area, it's normal; also know that EDR is pretty darn good, but if you're a little flex on that, could get saves up.<br><br>The two-hand- that's a nice choice for you; with it, can dish out very good damage (&amp; especially while everyone's terrified and/or AB penalized by yer rage of course). Totally cool. Very nice, and "terrifyingly" well done <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/01/06 07:18</span></i></p>

Well, there are a few problems with that... Toughness is a pre-requisite for being Dwarven Defender, so, HP stays, no matter what. I intend to get EDR III, and since the pre-requisite is 21 CON, 22 CON for the modifier gives little options, you could change Armor Skin for Great STR III and take STR at level 40 ending 26 STR and 21 CON, but I'll stick with the current. Saves are not completely bad, but I wouldn't see worthy to change a feat for save boosting feats... maybe that's just me, my non-shifting meleers usually have low saves.<br><br>There is just one thing actually, I noticed that frightening your opponent can be a little bit awkward if you're in Defensive Stance, since you have to deactivate it to chase, still, Terrifying Rage is good, the bonus outmatches the penalty.<br><br>Thanks a lot.<br><br>EDIT: Argh, I wrote wrong ACs... it should be 18/25 unbuffed and 22/29 buffed... can a moderator do me the favor of changing that? Thanks.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/02/06 02:12</span></i></p>

Like Finn pointed out in Deborah's recent Barbarian your Rage actually lasts 3+6(Con-modifier)+6(Rage-modifier)=15 rounds plus any Con-modifier from items(Or DefStance). This is possibly a bug, it's supposed to add the Con-modifier you gain from Rage, 3 in this case, but it adds Rage-bonus instead. Your gain actually.<br><br>Have you tewted out the Rage/stance thing? I made Barbarian/DD once and seem to remember that activating Rage after DStance makes DStance stop. As in <i>it seems activated</i>, but all the bonuses cease. I also seem to remember that activating Rage first worked however. How is your experience with this?<br><br>Cool build btw, although Law/Chaos changes isn't always the easiest.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Well, yes, actually practically any action except combat disables Defensive Stance's bonuses (although you mantain the non-movable stance, which is of no real use), I would use the Rage first... but you would get a 2 round longer Rage if you make Defensive Stance first, the problem is you'd need to deactivate it (because it counts as activated but with bonuses cancelled) and activate it again, it's just an informative issue, not very practical to really do that stuff, you lose a round of Defensive Stance and waste one for two extra rounds of Rage, which could get sorted out with CON boosting items.<br><br>Weird, well, another 3 rounds for my Rage, woot wooot, and I didn't do anything to get it, yay, anyway, good to know.<br><br>I had to left Terrifying Rage until the end or else there would've been another Alignment change.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/02/06 17:22</span></i></p>
