I am currently curious for some ideas on a Cleric Monk Shadowdancer build. I generally see this build as two weapon kama fighters which is under debate as to whether or not that is legal. I personally believe it is. the off hand attacks with flurry are legal at 99% of tabletop d&amp;d games why wouldnt it be legal in a computer game? Anyways, i was curious about anyones ideas for this build. Mostly for PvP usage.<br><br>-Cpu
