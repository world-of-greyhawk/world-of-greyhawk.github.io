<b>Playable from level 1 to 40... PvP or PvM</b> <br><br>The idea behind this build was to create a build that could use a two-handed weapon while maintaining a good AC.  I figured I might as well grab the scythe and some WM levels for some massive damage and the bard song made up for the loss of a shield.  While there are other Bard/Fighter/WMs there are none with over 16 bard levels. The build might still be better with a battle axe and shield, but it works quite nicely as is. Simply put 200 point critical hits are not to be underestimated.  Enemies last slightly longer against this build than they do against builds with Devastating Critical.  It should work well in low to mid magic settings where devastating critical is banned.  It will probably do best in team PvP but it should do well in PvP or PvM.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-Very nasty critical hits.  He has an X5 multiplier weapon and a 25% threat range.  With no magic equipment he does 165-195 (180 average). If he can max his strength he does 195-225 (210 average). Two or three of those critical hits will kill most enemies.<br>-Good AC while useing a Two-Handed Weapon.  With +5 equipment he can manage a 60 which is very good for a strength build using a two-handed weapon and okay for most builds.  That isn't even counting expertise mode.<br>-Level 19 Bard Song and level 20 Curse Song.  +5 to AC and +2 to AB for the bard and his allies and -5 AC and -2 AB for his enemies.  With Lasting Inspiration it lasts forever.<br>-Level 6 Bard Spells.  The DCs are useless, but there are a large number of buffs and with 23 levels he can only be dispelled by Mordenkainen's Disjunction or Holy Sword.<br>-Good AC for an Epic Bard.  He has a 42 unbuffed, Bard Song and War Cry raise that to a 46 and curse song effectively raises it to a 51.<br>-Maxed out UMD.  Always nice to have.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br><br>-Mediocre Hitpoints. 388, 414 with bard song.  It isn't horrible, but it could be better<br>-Low Saves.  Against spells they aren't bad (bard song will raise them to 32/35/30), but he'll be in trouble against a focused necromancer.  He can use clarity to help out the will save.  Against non spell effects they are quite bad.<br><br><b>Ruinous Raconteur</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Human<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Any non lawful<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 14<br>DEX 14<br>CON 14<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 14<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>All 10 increase Strength<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Bard 23<br>Fighter 10<br>Weapon Master 7<br><br><i>Level Distribution and Feats</i><br>Level 1: (Bard 1): Knockdown, Expertise<br>Level 2: (Fighter 1): Exotic Weapon Proficiency<br>Level 3: (Fighter 2): Weapon Focus (Scythe), Dodge<br>Level 4: (Fighter 3)<br>Level 5: (Fighter 4): Weapon Specialization (Scythe)<br>Level 6: (Fighter 5): Mobility<br>Level 7: (Bard 2)<br>Level 8: (Fighter 6): Spring Attack<br>Level 9: (Fighter 7): Whirlwind Attack<br>Level 10: (Fighter 8 ): Blind-Fight<br>Level 11: (Weapon Master 1)<br>Level 12: (Bard 3): Curse Song<br>Level 13: (Weapon Master 2)<br>Level 14: (Weapon Master 3)<br>Level 15: (Weapon Master 4): Improved Critical (Scythe)<br>Level 16: (Weapon Master 5)<br>Level 17: (Bard 4)<br>Level 18: (Weapon Master 6): Still Spell<br>Level 19: (Weapon Master 7)<br>Level 20: (Fighter 9)<br>Level 21: (Fighter 10): Epic Weapon Focus (Scythe), Epic Weapon Specialization (Scythe)<br>Level 22: (Bard 5)<br>Level 23: (Bard 6)<br>Level 24: (Bard 7): Epic Prowess<br>Level 25: (Bard 8 )<br>Level 26: (Bard 9)<br>Level 27: (Bard 10): Great Charisma I<br>Level 28: (Bard 11)<br>Level 29: (Bard 12)<br>Level 30: (Bard 13): Great Charisma II<br>Level 31: (Bard 14)<br>Level 32: (Bard 15)<br>Level 33: (Bard 16): Armor Skin<br>Level 34: (Bard 17)<br>Level 35: (Bard 18)<br>Level 36: (Bard 19): Great Strength I<br>Level 37: (Bard 20)<br>Level 38: (Bard 21)<br>Level 39: (Bard 22): Great Strength II<br>Level 40: (Bard 23): Lasting Inspiration<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 26<br>DEX 14<br>CON 14<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 16<br><br><i>AB and Damage</i><br>(no buffs, mundane scythe)<br>42/37/32/27 18+2D4 (17-20 x5)<br><br>(+4 to Strength [Bull's Strength], Bard Song, War Cry, Haste, Keen Edge, Greater Magic Weapon, Mundane Scythe)<br>53/48/43/38/53 31+2D4 (16-20 x5)<br><br>(As above with a +12 to Strength)<br>57/52/47/42/57 37+2D4 (16-20 x5)<br><br><i>AC</i><br>22 (no buffs, no equipment)<br>44 (Full Plate, haste, mage armor, bard song)<br>60 (+5 Full Plate, +5 Ring of Protection, +5 Amulet of Natural Armor, +5 Boots of the Sun Soul, Haste, Mage Armor, Bard Song)<br><br><i>Final Saves (Vs.

Good work, Mith: I'm glad you posted this; in my Blade series, all are bard/ftr/wm but one; Nimueh was urging me on one of em to go for an epic bard version, using the same class combo; I wound up dropping wm for cot, though, for hp, feats, saves, etc., in building Sling Blade, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "247650", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>  but yours w. the wm in there, me likes it very much, too: with wm, you've some really awesome crit damage (scythe? NICE!!!). (hey, we've a fighting-bard chorus proper now guys! Free beer and good eats for all fighting-bards!!! (nice, Mith: well done) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 08/10/06 07:15</span></i></p>

Mayor power, Scythe Weapon Masters are one of my favorite builds, whoever says luck doesn't exists just let him try his luck against recieving that Crit, heh, and he's still a Master of the Bardic buffing and lyrics, well done.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 08/12/06 21:42</span></i></p>

Checked out this build properly only now, it's a good one.<br><br>A little suggestion: drop 2 Great STR for an earlier LI, Toughness and ESF: Perform as your Bard bonus feat. I think it's worth the trade. You'll sing the 21st lvl song this way and if you add 1 point to perform (end 0n 43) you get the 23rd lvl curse song, without any item.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 09/25/06 11:58:10 (GMT) by xitooner<br><br>I find its better to be flexible, THINK, and know your enemy.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Pretty good suggestion Kail. Im not a huge fan of burning feats for the really high perform requirement songs, but I suppose vs. 1 AB and 2 damage, 40 HP and the better song are good option.  Kind of surprising to see a bunch of epic bard bard/fighter/WMs on the boards now (I've been playing a bit with the NWN2 toolset, so I haven't really been playing attention to the boards).  I will have to comment on them.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
