I'm sorry to say you forgot to include base and ending abilities.<br><br>Otherwise seems like a pretty hard-hitting build. I like how it contradicts your other one, The Survivor <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

What's the race (human) and starting/end stats?<br><br>Also, since you're taking Rogue levels pre-epic, I suggest that you do take Rogue at Level 1, then start on Fighter levels. This will net you 24 more skillpoints than taking Fighter at level 1. It will allow you to get Tumble 40 if that was cut out from skill point starvation. Also, do you really need so many WM levels? Increasing Rogue levels to 5 or 8 will allow you many more levels for skill dumps.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

In a quick glance I can figure out this guy's human with starting STR 15 CON 15 and at least DEX 13 and INT 13 for WM requirements. <br>Why last rogue on 33rd lvl? you fail to maximise tumble and UMD that way.<br>If you want to dualwield, rapiers are a poor choice IMO, get yourself shortswords or kukris instead...or anything small sized for the matter. BTW a huge crit rage does not mean you are gonna crit often, cause you still have to be able to hit to score a crit. And the ones you need to crit on usually have high ACs, therefore...<br>About taking so many WM lvls, I think WM truly shines when you take <i>at least</i> 19 lvls. Besides, taking less WM means loosing at least one feat and since he goes for dev crit he has little to spare.
