PvM 1-40<br><br>The focus of this build is to provide a TANK/MEATSHIELD for the party.  It will focus on Epic Gargoyle or Risen Lord form (I prefer gargoyle unless you face a dev crit/sneaker).  Vampire shape would be nice too.<br><br>AC is kept LOW for a reason.  You WANT them to hit you and do damage to themselves against your Acid Sheath or Elemental Shield.

Despite what the feat description says, you can take Undead Shape at Shifter 10.  Might be nice to get another level of Wiz rather than the 11th Shifter, for a bonus feat and a little more damage on your shields.

I'm not sure why you increase INT to 22... shifted you won't be casting... I suspect there's a reason but I don't discover it, you could change 2 INT for 2 CON to get more HP, I'm sure you want HP as any tanker, since, according to wikipedia (I'll trust it for now) Epic Gargoyle doesn't overrides CON...

"Greater Int feats were taken in the mage metamagic slots."<br><br>Since I was not going to be casting many spells (other than buffs and summons) I was not going to select the typical epic metamagic feats of penetration and the like.  That left me with Greater Int as a left over.  It's true that I could have swapped out some of my basic level up stat buffs for con instead of Int.  I took 4 normal INT increases pre-epic, the rest were CON.  The difference between 20 and 22 INT is an extra second and sixth level spell.  I thought at the time that the extra sixth level spell would do me more good (greater stoneskin, an extended Mestil's Acid Sheath, Empowered Elemental Shield).  Since the Acid Sheath/Elemental shield is very important to this build, I thought that one more per day would be better than 40 HPs and a +1 Fort save.  I can always drink potions while they bash up against my nice acid sheath.<br><br>The reason I took Druid up to level 7 was for the level 4 Druid Spells.  Freedom can be handy, or another StoneSkin without having to sacrifice a Mage Spell Slot (probably used for Elemental Shield). <br><br>This build can be tweeked here and there according to prefferences.  I just tried to get as many Elemental Shields or Acid Sheaths as I could (extended/empowered/maximized) and still have some Stoneskin left over.  This build is also good in a party with others, so you'll want to buff them too.<br><br>Risen Lord (the other nice Tank form) overrides Con.

Improvement tweaks:<br><br>@lvl 18 select Disarm instead of Skill Focus Disc.<br><br>Move Druid levels 6+7 later in live (after Wizard level 9).<br><br>==<br><br>Disarm is a very handy feat to spam while having an Acid Sheath up.  It provokes an attack of opportunity.  Good for forcing someone to hit you when they really don't want to.  If it does work, then you get a nice little bonus don't you.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br><br>Taking Wiz level 9 sooner is better, since that is the level at which you first get Acid Sheath.  Druid level 7 was to get Stone Skin.  Acid Sheath will help you level faster and survive longer.

Hm, definitely an interesting build - and I still think it would do well on a Dev. Crit. world, because Risen form has critical immmunity and will resist most of their damage (assuming they will be slashing as most choose such weapons for critic. range).<br><br>Can't think of any improvements though really, except what Thax already suggested.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By mantis3 on 09/05/07 19:43</span></i></p>
