This is my first attempt at an epic build.  I really enjoy playing dwarf fighters (Tanks!) as well as human paladins.  That led me to wonder how a dwarf would fair as a paladin (can you say self-healing tank)?  I checked out the search, but did not see any "Fighter, Paladin, Dwarven Defender".  I based this build on the Dwarven Landslide by Mithdradates...in case some it looks familiar.<br><br>I would be interested in any feedback...especially suggestions that would improve upon this build.<br><br><br>Avenging Dwarf<br>Male Dwarf (Lawful Good)<br><br>STR: 16<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 15<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>01: Fighter(1): Toughness, Weapon Focus: Warhammer<br>02: Fighter(2): Knockdown<br>03: Fighter(3): Power Attack<br>04: Paladin(1): CON+1, (CON=18)<br>05: Paladin(2): P: (Smite Evil)<br>06: Paladin(3): Two-Weapon Fighting<br>07: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Warhammer<br>08: Fighter(5): CON+1, (CON=19)<br>09: Paladin(4): Cleave<br>10: Fighter(6): Dodge<br>11: Fighter(7)<br>12: Paladin(5): CON+1, Extra Turning, (CON=20)<br>13: Fighter(8): Mobility<br>14: Fighter(9)<br>15: Fighter(10): Weapon Proficiency Exotic, Blind Fight<br>16: Fighter(11): CON+1, (CON=21)<br>17: Fighter(12): Expertise<br>18: Dwarven Defender(1): Spring Attack, DD: (Defensive Stance)<br>19: Dwarven Defender(2): DD: (Defensive Awareness I)<br>20: Dwarven Defender(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>21: Dwarven Defender(4): Armor Skin<br>22: Dwarven Defender(5)<br>23: Dwarven Defender(6)<br>24: Dwarven Defender(7): STR+1, Improved Critical: Longsword, (STR=18)<br>25: Dwarven Defender(8)<br>26: Dwarven Defender(9)<br>27: Dwarven Defender(10): Whirlwind Attack<br>28: Dwarven Defender(11): STR+1, (STR=19)<br>29: Dwarven Defender(12)<br>30: Dwarven Defender(13): Epic Weapon Focus: Warhammer<br>31: Dwarven Defender(14): Epic Toughness I<br>32: Dwarven Defender(15): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>33: Dwarven Defender(16): Epic Damage Reduction I<br>34: Dwarven Defender(17)<br>35: Dwarven Defender(18): Epic Toughness II<br>36: Fighter(13): STR+1, Extra Smiting, (STR=21)<br>37: Fighter(14): Epic Weapon Specialization: Warhammer<br>38: Fighter(15)<br>39: Fighter(16): Epic Toughness III, Epic Damage Reduction II<br>40: Fighter(17): STR+1, (STR=22)<br><br>Final Stats:<br>Fighter(17), Paladin(5), Dwarven Defender(18), Dwarf<br>STR: 22<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 21<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 6<br><br>Hitpoints: 736<br>Skillpoints: 172<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 30/17/18<br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 38 (melee), 32 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 18/28<br>Spell Casting: <br>none<br><br>Discipline 43(48), Intimidate 8(6), Spellcraft 21(23), Spot 22(21), Tumble 21(23)<br><br>01: Discipline(4), Intimidate(2), Spellcraft(2), Tumble(2), <br>02: Discipline(1), Save(3), <br>03: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), <br>04: Discipline(1), Save(3), <br>05: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), <br>06: Discipline(1), Save(3), <br>07: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), <br>08: Discipline(1), Save(3), <br>09: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(2), Tumble(1), <br>10: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(1), <br>11: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), <br>12: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(1), <br>13: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), <br>14: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(1), <br>15: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), <br>16: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(1), <br>17: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), <br>18: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Spot(1), <br>19: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), <br>20: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), <br>21: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(1), <br>22: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(1), <br>23: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), <br>24: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(2), <br>25: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), <br>26: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(2), <br>27: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), <br>28: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(2), <br>29: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), <br>30: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(2), <br>31: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), <br>32: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(2), <br>33: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), <br>34: Discipline(1), Spot(2), Save(1), <br>35: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), <br>36: Discipline(1), Save(3), <br>37: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), <br>38: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Save(1), <br>39: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), <br>40: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Save(1),

Why do you boost Constitution in early pre-epic? Especially when you pick your first EDR feat at level 33, I can't see a reason for it.<br><br>Secondly, what do you hope to achieve with SMITING when you have 6 Charisma, and 5 Paladin levels?<br><br>And Epic Toughnesses aren't generally recommended. Substitute one of these for Great Constitution, this'll net you +1 to Fortitude saves and you lose only 20 HP. It also enables you to pick EDR3, and another feat.<br><br>Finally, drop WWA.<br><br>A few points there, hope it helps. Feel free to ask why I recommend these changes <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>Now is my day's work done;<br>I'll take good breath:<br>Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of<br>blood and death.

Think a couple of points have been covered, but here's my tuppence worth...<br><br>1. With your starting stats you have a spare point, which I would put in CON to give you 16 to start (don't forget that Dwarf's suffer a -2 to CHA and gain a +2 to CON). <br><br>2. Why Paladin? you don't benefit from Divine Grace as you have a -1 modifier to your CHA. Your smiting ability will be hampered by this as well. I would question taking Extra Smiting further in the build because of this.<br><br>3. Weapon Proficiency Exotic - a waste really, as you have focussed and specialised in Warhammer already. <br><br>4. Extra Turning - fairly useless - again is influenced by your CHA modifier - if you were taking Divine Might and Divine Shield then I could understand it some, but you would need to get a decent CHA to make use of both.<br><br>5. Spring Attack - not really necessary as you have over 15 ranks in Tumble, which negates the majority of AoO's in combat<br><br>6. Intimidate - a waste really as you don't get it high enough to be effective (consider Taunt instead which is a Paladin class skill - this can be very handy if successful)<br><br>7. Two Weapon Fighting - no point without Ambidexterity and Improved Two Weapon Fighting (which you would need a DEX Of 15 for anyway). Nevermind the fact that dual wielding two Warhammers would reduce your AB too far anyway.<br><br>8. Mobility - of no real benefit to this type of build - you need Dodge to qualify for DwD, but I wouldn't bother with this, unless you wanted to qualify for Weapon Master (which you do btw), or Shadowdancer. <br><br>9.  Epic TOughness - I'd try to squeeze in EDR III, Epic Prowess instead at the least. <br><br>10. Improved Critical: Longsword - why? do you mean Warhammer?<br><br>11. The healing ability this Paladin has is minimal, as you have a negative CHA Modifier.<br><br>Other feats to consider: <br><br>1. Luck of Heros at 1st level only<br>2. Improved Knockdown<br>3. EDR III <br>4. EPic Prowess<br>5. Improved Critical: Warhammer<br><br>I would seriously reconsider the use of Paladin in this build.. perhaps Champion of Torm, Weapon Master instead?<br><br>I think you are trying to achieve too many things with this build, that really aren't necessary. For instance, qualifying for Weapon Master, when you aren't going to take any levels in it. <br><br>If you want a self buffer, then Cleric is always a good start, which is quite achievable with a little tinkering with your starting stats (i.e. Drop STR to 14 and DEX to 12, then you start with a WIS of 14, this will raise your Will save by 3 points as well as allowing you access to 4th level Cleric spells, if you should take it. A bonus Feat of CoT in epic is Great Wisdom don't forget. <br><br>See where I am going with this? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Anyway, hope this helps you some in improving your build.

Thanks I...Samphus and FinneousPJ, this is exactly the type of feedback I was hoping for.<br><br>For future reference, is there a better character building guide than what came with the game?  I have been looking through the other posts as well as the download section, but have not seen anything specific.  I am looking for something that better illustrates what feats are available for each character type and when?   Or what feats have a prerequisite to other feats or skill levels.<br>_________________<br>You can run, but you'll just die tired!

I'm working on writing a guide but I'm finding I'm lazy and it's a lot harder work than I expected.

Any additional guides or build sheets would be a great help, especially to us (relatively) newbies.<br><br>FinneousPJ – Thank for the link, that looks like just what I was looking for.<br><br>Bromium – Always good to get a second opinion!  I should have said that I am using the spreadsheet, which is a great tool.  Are there other tools like the CBC available?<br>_________________<br>You can run, but you'll just die tired!

I guess your starting stats should be read as CON 17 and CHA 6, am I right? In fact at 4th lvl you indicate 18 CON after the stat bump.<br><br>Also, take final CON to 22: Great Con instead of one epic toughness. It gives you +20 HP and +1 For save over it. And since you got +20 HP from Great con you might consider trading another epic toughness for EDR III<br><br>Cheers<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò
