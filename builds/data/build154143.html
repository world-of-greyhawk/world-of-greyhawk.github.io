<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM</b><br><br>I re-jigged the starting stats and levelling order so it finishes with an extra +1 to AB, a bit more HP and an extra feat.

So at the cost of one useless feat, a bit of re-jigging of the feats, and being stuck with level 4 Cleric spells for most of its levelling life, Disciple v3.0 gets +1 BAB, better saves, +2 AC, +40 HP and Blind Fight. Definitely worth it, huh?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 07/07/05 23:43</span></i></p>

The downside is definitely that Divine Might and Divine Shield take a while to cast and don't last long.<br><br>There are also a few inaccuracies with the build:<br>lvl 18 - Extra Smiting is not a CoT extra feat. I took Blind Fight.<br>lvl 20 - If you took Blind Fight at lvl 18, then you have to pick a CoT feat that's not part of the build. I thought the best choices were Knockdown or Great Cleave (I took the later).<br>lvl 21 - You probably want to take Extra Smiting here instead of Great Charisma. The thing is that all those Great Smite's won't matter if you can only use Smite once.<br><br>I wasn't sure about the Great Wisdom feats at lvl 22 and 24. I think these are for the Cleric lvls that come much later (so you can cast 5th and 6th lvl spells I guess). I would take them at lvl 28 and 32 instead and take Great Smite here instead.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 09/16/04 18:50</span></i></p>
