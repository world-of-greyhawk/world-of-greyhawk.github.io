Could someone point me to a build like thin or atleast help me with what one believes the starting stats and a couple good tips on feats to take along the way?<br><br>Thinking Cleric first six levels then monk, then Dancer, then 3 levels of Cleric to get to 9/1/1, then it gets a bit vague as I suck with builds.  This one seems very versatile.<br><br>Thanks

First, to maximise BAB (which rises at a fixed rate after level 20) you want to take these classes so that they are divisible by 4 at level 20 (giving you +15 BAB)<br><br>So levelling cleric to 9 would be a mistake and instead you should go for cleric 8, monk 8 , shadowdancer 4 at level 20. <br><br>Second, Shadowdancer 10 in this build is a waste. Shadowdancer gives slippery mind at level 7 and improved evasion at level 10, monk level 9 also gives improved evasion. So monk 23/ cleric 10/SD7 or monk 25/Cleric 10 / SD 5 would be the way i would go.<br><br>You havent said whether you are going STR , WIS or DEX based. DEX based I would aim to get epic dodge once your dex is 25. I havent had a huge amount of experience with STR or WIS based. <br><br>I would take your last cleric level very late in the game so as to maximise your spellcraft (every 5 skill gives +1 to your spells save). <br><br>Other than that I dont think we can be more specific until you give more detail.<br><br>Syrath

If you go to the builds forum, check the build index. You can hit ctrl-f to find key words like monk, cleric or shadowdancer. You can keep hitting find next until you spot something similar to what you have in mind. Then make tweaks you wish for your playstyle.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

I'm playing a character at the moment that is close to what you're looking for. It's a Monk 20 / Cleric 15 / Shadowdancer 5. <br><br>You can find my build here: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "171270", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Shadow Cleric</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Zhoreb on 01/17/05 12:02</span></i></p>

My recommendation would be Monk 9/Cleric 26/SD 5.  This will get you all the feats you need for Epic Dodge, while still getting you a decent caster level and 2 Cleric bonus feats.  <br><br>Alternatively, you could go Rogue 13/Cleric 26/Monk 1 and take the Trickery domain.  You'd still get Epic Dodge, as well as 7d6 sneak attacks.  Although you'd lose HiPS, you would get Improved Invis., which not only would allow you to get sneak attacks but which would also get you %50 concealment.  <br><br>As for your other domain, consider Magic, Plant, or Healing.  Magic will give you Melf's Acid Arrow and Ice Storm, neither of which have a save.  Plant gets you Barkskin (+5 natural AC) and Creeping Doom, which can do as much as 1000 damage to multiple opponents (just cast Word of Faith to stun them first).  Healing will of course Empower all your cure spells, and gives you access to cures and Heal at lower levels than normally.
