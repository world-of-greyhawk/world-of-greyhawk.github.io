Please tell me about the bugs with the Dodge feat. someone said it was not necessary for Epic dodge in a thread, but I can't find it. Please update me? And someone even said it wasn't necessary to become Shadowdancer. This true? Anything else? Dwarven defender?<br>Thanks in advance.

It's not only a direct prerequisite for the class, but it's also a prerequisite for mobility, which is itself an SD prerequisite.  So, even if the game didn't check for dodge itself when determining if you qualify for SD, you still need it for mobility. <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Dwarven defender?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Definitely requires dodge.<br><br>Steve

Dodge is not a requirement for Epic Dodge neither is the tumble requirment. You only need 1 rank in tumble. <br><br>Neither are big issues. You have to be a rogue or a shadowdancer with 25 DEX to qualify for epic dodge in the first place. If you were a dex rogue that didnt have dodge then Id class you as crazy.

Thanks for the info. Why would a high lvl Rogue be crazy without dodge? If it's not necessary for Epic dodge, why waste a feat on it? All it does is give you 1 AC vs 1 opponent. I am sure you can make more use of a feat than that......

No. According to the manuals you need <i>30</i> Tumble for Epic Dodge.<br><br>This is not the case, however. You only need 1 rank in Tumble (plus the other prereqs: Def Roll, Imp Evasion, DEX 25, and epic character)<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

To be even more precisely: you need to be able to use the tumble skill and since using the tumble skill requires training you need at least one rank in tumble. If tumble wouldn't require training you wouldn't need any tumble ranks for epic dodge.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.Detail&amp;id=856" target="_blank">Character Build Calculator</a>(works with Excel, Open Office) 2.83: updated to NWN 1.69.
