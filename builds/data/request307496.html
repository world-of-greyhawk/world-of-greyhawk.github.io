I was looking for a monk build to use when I came across a post in this thread:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "201081", "0", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/24/05 14:24 (GMT) -- grizzled_dwarflord<br>To summarize, in a low to no-magic world, my guess is that Ki Strike could be King, especially if you made a Dex/Wis based 30Monk/10CoT and could also lay down some wicked Stunning Fists and or Quivering Palm.  In such a build, even if you started with a 15Wis and 16Dex, you could easily get a 32 Dex and 20Wis, a 42 natural AC, and a 40AB, with all CoT taken in Epic.  And saves that people would kill for.  Not bad, eh?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Has anyone actually made this build? If so could the details on what to put into each stat, skills etc be posted up. If it doesn't exist, would a builder like to give it a shot? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  I'm no good with this sort of thing otherwise I would try it myself.

One more mistake like that, and I'm gonna have to bump you back down to KP with Avado.<br><br>Anyway, not that I would ever play anything like this, because, well, if you find yourself taking Improved Ki Strikes in a build, one of two things is possible:  either A- You have absolutely no idea what you're doing, or B- you're actually playing in an environment that has been so keenly adapted and superbly balanced for low magic, that the sheer awesomeness of such a world could rip the very fabric of space and time.  99.987% of the time, A is the right choice.  But, given that all things are possible, I'll give you my version of a Ki Strike build.<br><br>First, don't go Halfling... or gnome.  You need big fists.  Since we'll be using CoT and SD in this build, all races are possible, including half-orc.  In fact, you can do a Half-orc with an 18 Strength and still get a Wis21, Dex26-28 with some Epic Dodge and Ki Strikes.<br><br>I chose, against my better judgment, Elf.  I think it actually works the best for these kind of Monks.  You don't need Intelligence in a Monk build.  I'd leave it at 8, or 6 if playing Half-Orc.  The only skill you really need is Tumble.  <br><br>I'd do something like this:<br><br>Str14<br>Int8 ( only need 2-3 skills really, if that)<br>Wis16<br>Dex18<br>Con10<br>Chr8<br><br>1 Monk1, Toughness<br>2 Monk2<br>3 Monk3, Weapon Finesse<br>4 Monk4, Dex19<br>5 Monk5<br>6 Monk6, Blindfighting<br>7 Monk7<br>8 Monk8, Dex20<br>9 Monk9, Dodge<br>10 Monk10<br>11 Monk11<br>12 Monk12, Mobility, Dex21<br>13 Monk13<br>14 Monk14<br>15 Monk15, WF: Unarmed<br>16 Monk16, Dex22<br>17 SD1<br>18 SD2, WF: Kama<br>19 SD3<br>20 CoT1, Dex23<br>21 Monk17, Great Dex I<br>22 Monk18<br>23 CoT2, Great Wis I<br>24 CoT3, Great Wis II, Dex25<br>25 CoT4, Great Wis III<br>26 SD4<br>27 SD5, Epic Dodge<br>28 CoT5, Wis20<br>29 CoT6, Great Wis IV<br>30 Monk19, Improved Ki Strike +4<br>31 Monk20<br>32 Monk21, Dex26<br>33 Monk22, Improved Ki Strike +5<br>34 CoT7<br>35 CoT8, EWF: Unarmed<br>36 CoT9.

Saves are rock solid, got a semi-decent Quivering Palm DC, and the ISFs are dangerous enough that you'll land one when it counts.<br><br>Oh, and as a side note, if you're looking for a good stunner, I fooled around with <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "221720", "15", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Shadowboxer</a>, once upon a time.

I chose Halfling because in all honesty, I'm not very fond of 1d20, I have horrible luck with damage variance and sadly I get higher average damage out of 2d6 then I do out of 1d20..it's pitiful really.<br><br>I also skimped on the ki feats because I couldn't bring myself to put such horrible feats into a build..if they added stackable AB outside of the +20 cap, it'ld be a different story <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">
