looking for someone to put together a 21ranger 16pally 3monk.<br><br>basic idea i have is to use 21 ranger for the free duelwield feats, pre epic bab and bane of enemys. 3 monk for the 10 attcks per round and monk speed/ac. 16pally for ab buffs and holy sword, divine shield for added ac. dex based to use robes keeping the monk ac/speed and duelwield from ranger. only draw back not having Uncanny Dodge on a dex based build.<br><br>this would be a pvp build using humans, dwarves, halfings as favored enemys, hoping it will have (with items and buffs) around 70ab and 80ac.. +12 ability gear is easy to get where i play so starting with a low cha shouldnt make divine shield useless.. max eb is +6, low damage per hit is not a problem since adding elemental damage to weapons (kamas in this case) is very easily done via a magic item forge. max of 2d12 damage per damage type and max of 4 types of damage. usually using one slot on a weapon for eb. eg. kamas used would have +6eb and a total of 6d12 of given damage types.

I was bored out of my mind, so I wrapped this up:<br>Lawfull good, Elf<br>str: 13<br>Dex: 18 (30)<br>Con: 10<br>Wis: 12 (you'll need some wis+2 or more item for spells)<br>Int: 10<br>Cha: 13<br><br>All points into dex.<br><br>1-10 Ranger<br>WF: Kama, FE<br>Weapon finesse<br>FE<br>Power attack<br>Imp crit<br>FE<br>11-20: Paladin:<br>Toughness<br>Blind fight<br>Iron will<br>21-22: Monk<br>Epic Prowess<br>- Skilldump tumble<br>23-25 Paladin:<br>Armor Skin<br>26-36 Ranger:<br>EWF: Kama<br>Great dex, FE<br>Great dex<br>FE<br>Bane of Enemies<br>37-39 Paladin:<br>Divine Shield<br>40 Monk:<br>Max out tumble, discipline and listen, 11 points into something else.<br><br>Havent tested it, but it should be something like this:<br><br>AB: 30 BAB+10 dex+2EWF+1EP+1WF(+2 on FE)= 44AB (46 vs FE)<br>AC: 10 base+10 dex+1 wis+2 AS+8 tumble+1 Divine shield= 32 AC robed. (Can be boosted significantly with +12 items and other magic stuff)<br><br>Damage dealt: Str 1+1d6 kama(+(5+2d6) on FE)= 2-8 (9-26 vs FE)<br><br>HPs: 434 max<br>Saves:<br>fort 25<br>will 20<br>ref 27<br><br>Stunning fist DC: 31<br><br>Don't blame me for not following normal sheet rules and stuff, its late and its unofficial. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_sleep2.gif"> <br><br>But seriously, I'd drop that divine shield nonsense for more wis and dex, and far more power overall.<br>Even with +12 cha you'll just get 7 AC for 7 rounds, thats a whooping 42 seconds for you! (not counting laggs)<br>Thinking of it, extra turning comes into mind, perhaps instead of iron will...<br><br>Anyways, this took way too long due to my all consuming torrent tracker, so now its back to study for me.<br><br>Enjoy this builds uselessness, and try to think of some decent way of tweaking it.<br><br>Me out.
