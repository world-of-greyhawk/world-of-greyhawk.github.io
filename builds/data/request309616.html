Someone recommend a good Monk/Rouge/WM heavy build using dual kama's. With High Ab and decent damage. Not sure if I should go Str or Dex.<br><br>I play on a high magic server +20 weapons are available,there is a fullt functional forge to add to weapons, AC to gear as well as ablity points lots of chances for a variety of UMD. The monsters are very tough as you get to higher lvl, they are able to hit AC 60 and above regularly. The monsters do not have that high of magic. However some creatures do elemental damage for a fair amount.<br><br>For some reason the Epic Chac build is not up. At least I could not get to it.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By sc00ter1821 on 06/09/09 23:20</span></i></p>

Dude...  You have to let US know what YOU like to play.  A wm/monk/rog is way to vague for INTELLIGENT conversation...<br><br>But (seeing that intelligence isnt required in this thread), Go dexer.  Why?  Sure, str goes to damage, but with the junk on the gear you mention, that is the LAST thing you really need.  Dex adds to BOTH ab and ac.  You will find that AC is most necessary with +20 lying around like leaves on the ground.<br><br>Going dex means you MUST have epic dodge, so you need 13 or so Rogue lvls.  That will limit your wm lvls.  I know you think you understand why you want monk, but it becomes clear that really, monk is a waste of lvls for this type of character.  I would seriously try to do a rog 13/wm25/mk2 type of thing.  That gives you everything you need.<br><br>If the index does come back, remember that you MUST have tumble 30 for ED so check the builds.  There are alot of ED builds that take ED before that and wont work now.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted <b>06/23/04</b> 21:16 (GMT) -- Anuis<br><br>Suolucider, Blitz 04, <b>avado</b>, Quisition, Boourns, ... welcome to the guild!

Yeah, Epic Dodge sounds like a must on any Rogue in such a high magic environment, at least that way you know you'll evade some hits.<br><br>There is one thing with going Monk/WM/Rogue. The thing is Weapon Master is your only high BAB class, so if you want 6 APR, you need to take a lot of Weapon Master pre-epic, like Monk 2 / Rogue 8 / Weapon master 10, that gives you 17 pre-epic BAB, I think that's a fine spread for pre-epic. In epics you go for completing the pre-requirements of Epic Dodge as soon as possible and then fill up with Weapon master, end with a Rogue skilldump or two. That should work IMO.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 06/10/09 04:41</span></i></p>

Lets say he's Human and starts as Rogue thats 2 feats at 1st level, 1 each at 3rd 6th and 9th = 5 feats. WM requires 6, right? <br><br>There is one other way to obtain Epic Dodge with this split and that is by going Rogue 10/Monk 9, but I will agree that going with more Rogue levels and less Monk will undoubtedly make for a stronger build in this case.

True, I forgot that non-Fighter Weapon Masters always die when it comes to taking all the pre-requisite feats. Then you might be able to go with Monk 2 / Rogue 12 / Weapon Master 6, that gives 16 pre-epic BAB, still 6 APR.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
