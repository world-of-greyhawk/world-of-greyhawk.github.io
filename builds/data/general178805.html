I wonder will they post my build - I sent it, but received no response. I guess that means everything's alright, but I have a different language version and don't know will these characters be compatible (although mods and english characters are).

I was seriously wondering if this guild should perhabs do something a bit different with the epic builds.<br>Find a concept for a character that intreques many NWN players then dicuss for a few weeks the best way to make this build and then make the final setup and give it to Bioware <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>Think if it was done this way, alot of really good all-round builds would be posted rather than those right now already posted, though i really liked the Wrathful Berserker. It was something different than most barbarians. But i really feel that all could contribute to those builds.

Something along the lines of what you suggested was attempted to create pure class builds, i.e. just 40 levels of one class, or ten levels of one class and thirty levels of a prestige class.  There were supposely "iconic" builds.  The result was pure bedlum, nobody could agree on which direction the builds should be taken in, what skills should be used or which attributes should be dominant.  It digressed into a flame war on several occasions, primarily over clerics though there was a bit of a scuffle over rangers as well.<br><br>I'm gonna go with too many cooks spoil the broth, rather than two heads are better than one, and say no thanks.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

One possibility to get a lot of builders involved is to pick out a number of potential epic builds and use some sort of voting/poll program to pick a few. This way it's only a yay/nay system which should minimize any bickering. (and i'm not talking about a thread, im talking about something where you just click on your favorite and that's that.) Then everyone has an idea of which will be used and can offer comments to the creators, who ultimately decide on the finished product, but will hopefully weigh out all the advice. That way you may end up getting much more interesting and/or strong builds.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?
