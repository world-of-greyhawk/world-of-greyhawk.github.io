Well, to be completely immune you need 37 Monk levels and Improved SR X. Not much room for anything else, is there. That build is nearly immune (there are spell that ignore SR completely). Closest you can get anyway, but you have to sacrifice everything else to get there. That means you're not going to be able to kill the mages, you can just sit there and wait for them to waste their spells on you.<br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm

I wasn't sure whether it favors the resister or not and said Monk 37 to not err in my advise <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  However, as the rules often seem to be on the defender's side, it's quite safe to assume Monk 36 is enough. Monk 36'd allow Fighter4 for EWS: Unarmed or Kama, but whichever the case it's not a very enjoyable build IMHO.<br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm

Oh, and just an FYI on the Dev Crit comment in that quote you posted: if your AC is so high that you can only be hit on a roll of 20 (i.e. your AC is 21 or more higher than your attacker's AB), you cannot be Dev Critted at all.<br>_________________<br>Captain's Log, Stardate 6051: had trouble sleeping last night... my hiatal hernia is acting up.

Alternate way of resisting spells is via the Spell Resistance spell...however this can be breached, you won't get as much SR as with monk and Improved SR ? however, can still get up to 52...combined with some useful cleric buffs u can still make a build with reasonable SR and plenty of oomph with the sword <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!

About that monk/sorc/rdd build - as I recall, he went dex-based for some bizarre reason on that build, thus had low AB. Don't do that. You can make a decent monk/sorc/rdd, but start Str at 16, dex at 14, and pump Str all the way. You will end up with a Str of around 40 (or at least 34 if you use all your general feats for Imp SR instead of Great Str). That will give you decent AB. I would also consider going Monk 25/Sorc 1/RDD 14 - lets you pick up another epic bonus feat, although it costs you a bit of SR.<br><br>In general, there are 3 ways to become "spell resistant", and 2 more to become a high save build:<br><br>One is to take lots of Monk levels. Yes, you need SR 57 to be totally immune to all spells, but many spellcaster builds only have 35-38 caster levels, and many skip the Spell Penetration feats to take Spell Foci or other metamagic feats (aiming just to beat the toolset 32 SR), so anything in the high 40's is usually quite effective (unless you know for sure you will be facing a level 40 caster with all spell pen feats). So a build with 30+ monk levels and a few SR feats will do pretty well against most spellcasters (but not all).<br><br>Two is to take lots of Druid or Cleric levels, and cast Spell Resistance. You get your caster level +12 SR, so again while you can't reach 57, you can get into the high 40's, which is pretty effective. A Cleric/Fighter build, or Cleric/Monk build, or Cleric/Paladin build can be very effective in melee with buffs and be nearly immune to spells with SR of 46-52.<br><br>Three is to take Sorc/Wizard levels, and cast Spell Mantle (preferably Empowered). This will absorb 12+1-12 levels of spells cast at you. You are effectively immune to spells until it is used up or ends, and you can always cast it again. Not a melee build, though.<br><br>To become a high-save build, you can take CoT levels (+1 to all saves per 2 CoT levels). Any fighter build that has room classwise should consider CoT levels - CoT can even take EWS in epic levels, so you only need 4 fighter levels to take WS/EWS. You can drop fighter completely for CoT in any Str-based build and only give up WS/EWS for 6 damage (but if you are Str-based, damage will be high anyway). Bard/CoT/RDD for example has almost all the benefits of Ftr/Bard/RDD (same # of feats, etc.), but gives up WS/EWS to gain +7 to all saves (assuming Bard 16/CoT 14/RDD 10 split). <br><br>Last, take Paladin levels and go Cha-based. Pal adds the Cha bonus to saves, so you will end up with very high saves. Pal multiclasses well with Fighter, CoT (for even higher saves), and Sorc/RDD (like the monk/sorc/rdd build above). Paladin also has the spell Holy Sword which lets you dispel on hit, very useful against casters. <br><br>TM

Ehm, tattoed Monk-boy, read the early posts, you need 66 or 67 SR to be immune, not 57.

Since you didn't say it, TM, the Clerics or Druids are as good as plush dolls after the initial Mord's.<br><br>Having saves in the 60s is nice, yes, but Ike's Yikes has no save.

Yes, I know it won't give 100% protection against a level 40 pure sorc with Epic Spell Pen, but those are rare. Most sorc's skip the Spell Pen feats since they want to have room for some spell foci, and they often take a few levels of Pal, Monk, or Fighter. Wizards are more likely to take the Spell Penetration feats since they have more bonus feats to spend, but also tend to multiclass more with Fighter, Rogue, or Monk for a few levels. Most spellcaster builds I have seen have 30-35 caster levels, usually without spell pen feats. Against those, 55 SR is enough for 100% protection, and 48-50 will give you better than 75%. <br><br>Yes, you will get hit very often by a pure caster with ESP with such a build, but aiming for ~50 SR leaves you a lot more flexibility to keep the build reasonably effective against other enemies. Going for Imp SR X leaves you only 1 epic feat to use for anything else, so you end with low AB and abilities. Fine if you are in a party as the anti-mage specialist, but not so good for a playable character against anything else.<br><br>TM

You are right about most caster builds focusing in penetrating the toolset SR of 32. However, if I were to build a character designed to battle spellcasters and laugh at their pitiful attempts at nuking you with Ike's, I'd want to be absolutely sure <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm

Like I said, if you are going to be the party's anti-mage, go ahead and take all the SR feats, and hide behind the fighters against the melee mobs. But if you want to solo, or be able to have a chance against non-casters as well, you can build a level 35-40 monk with an SR of around 50-55 and still get Dex or Str up to 30, take ED or EWS, and have a decent AB. You will still be able to handle most mages, but you won't be worthless against anything else.<br><br>TM

That's what I said in my first post (though I recall I said you can't even handle the mages <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <b></b>). My experience tells me you're not going to be able to kill the mages just like that - you will have to stand there, waiting for their protections to go down, plonking arrows at them so you don't get hit by their damage shields. Perhaps, when they are out of spells and their shields have worn out, you'll be able to take them out. Correct?<br><br>Interesting topic, actually, cheers to the OP <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm

Do you mean taking a DD against Spell Casters? No, absolutely not. It'd help against the bludgeoning damage from Ice Storm, I guess, but that's about it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm
