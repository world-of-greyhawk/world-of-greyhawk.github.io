Well, it's obviously a nice character, but as always with clerics you're going to have one major problem: Dispels. Many people in PW's and even in Arenas can obtain Dispel Scrolls or Rods, and a Greater Dispel (maybe even a regular dispel) would completely obliterate your AB, because you rely so much on Cleric to buff it.<br><br>Other than that, it's pretty neat...and confusing for not being a rogue.=P

Cleric buffs are really only for damage, and in fact the most important Cleric buff is your extended Silence as this helps to negate peoples listen checks, allowing for moderately junk Move Silently!<br><br>...<br><br>Yeah I know there aren't any Rogue levels, hence the name (with no Rogue levels)!

Besides, the point of the Devastating Rogue in the Epic Builds page is to have huge Sneak Attacks and Devastating Critical.

Just for reference, I was explaining that he might have used Rogue as a descriptor. Just like you might call someone a "Swashbuckler", when they're actually just a Fighter.

Thus an Elf (favored class wizard) with 3 Rogue and 1 Ranger would have an ECL Penalty of -20% XP, since neither class is a favored class, and there is more than 1 level difference between them.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>but now you are confusing Favored classes and xp-penalties. ECL is effective character level, true. Say, you are a Drow, it has ECL+2. What that means is that a Drow that is a level 1 fighter counts as being lvl 3. So he need s the same amount of xp that others need to become lvl4 to become lvl 2.<br><br>A Drow Wizard10/Rogue2 counts as being lvl 14. 12 class levels + 2 lvls from its ECL rating. The total ECL is 14. That affects xp received and such things, he counts as a lvl 14 character in every way, except when counting Hitdice, for resisting spells etc.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

That is correct.  Ythaniel basically got it right, he just confused ECL with xp penalties.  ECL determines your xp granted through combat successes based upon your effective character level.  A Wizard4 would have an ECL of 2, so would receive xp as if he were a 2nd level fighter, while a Bard8 would have an ECL=4 (IIRC).  Races and favored classes aren't figured into that equation, but <i>after</i> that equation.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

The thing with this build is, if you had named it properly (ie no mention of ROGUE) there would be no discussion on it at all.   It is a typical DC build, no more no less.   All this discussion about "rogue" is immaterial.  I appreciate that you think you said this "is" a rogue, but I am certain to see that it clearly isnt what you said it is.   <br><br>To be a rogue in NWN, you use the rogue class!  Non of the combination of classes you picked up can replace the skill set for Rogue, so you are not!  You are a cleric/ranger/monk who likes to lurk in the shadows, ambushing people cuz you dont have the face to face skill to stand toe to toe.  Please understand, I am NOT saying your build is ineffective, it most certainly IS.  But just because you sneak around doesnt make you a rogue!  I know this is the point of this silliness!   <br><br>How you rp a build is immaterial to this forum, UNLESS your rp AND classes make sense.   In an rp sense, most certainly, a character with the strategy that you outline WILL be a rogue!  They will LOVE the idea of sneak attacks!  Most certainly, they would have LOTS of sneak damage to really make up for the fact that they lurk in shadows.   All that was made is that you have forfieted lotsa sneak damage for basically nothing special.  <br><br>Let me put it this way:  IF i create a pure fighter with High AB (str) and DC, then walk up to someone who sees me and I swing my +10 greatsword of smiting silliness and he rolls a 1, does that make me a rogue?   No.  It makes me a DC fighter.  This is what you are basically telling us.  <br><br>For the second time in 2 days, I am moved to beg the question, WHY are we having such a long discussion about something so simple.<br><br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 06/15/06 16:30</span></i></p>

Do suggest another name then, I'll edit it in. "The REAL Devastating Rogue (with no Rogue levels)" will not do however.<br><br>It's not a matter of people's stupidity. The original title and your comments regarding the Devastating Rogue are still in, so the connection you wanted to point at is left. Rogue is something very specific in NWN/D&amp;D and <i>this is no Rogue</i>. <i>It's neither the Devastating Rogue at all</i>, since that is a well known build on the official Epic Builds page. The former title has both nothing to do with the build <b>and</b> it refers to another well known build with which, again it has nothing to do. Build a, I dunno, Rogue 24/FTR 6/CoT 10 and call it "The REAL Devastating Rogue" or "The Improved Devastating Rogue" and everything's fine. I could have called my Holy Reaper "The Playable Damage Adept" and it would have been fine (but I prefer to put such pointers in the description of the build). Even though there's much freedom regarding titles, your former one is not fine.

It should also be noted that the OP didn't set precedent with this concept, that is, naming a build a "core class", and then not have that class present in the build.

Okay, I think people are missing the point here. The name was an obvious reference to the BioWare Epic Build <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_devastatingrogue.html" target="_blank">Devastating Rogue</a>, however the build itself is nothing like it! The original Devastating Rogue is a Rogue-heavy build with a lot of Sneak Dice, skill points, Devastating Critical and Crippling Strike. This build doesn't even have Sneak Attacks and yet it was named "The REAL Devastating Rogue" or whatever it was -- that's ridiculous. This build has nothing to do with the Epic Builds page Devastating Rogue.

Finn clearly explains the main issue I see. I believe that point is clear so I won't go anymore into it.<br><br>I should have probably been clearer in asking krsboss to suggest a new title for the build, but the fact is that I did once suggest a change of title than the issue slipped my mind until I was deep into updating the index. I apologize if my approach seemed rude, it was not my intention. <br><br>To answer GD's issue: intentionally duplicating a well known build name in a build that bear no resemblance not even to the original build's <i>concept</i> is not just disagreeable on my side, it is unacceptable. It may not be written (yet) in the rules, but it's a matter of common sense. Moderator's job is to change such things; I expect any moderator to change an unproper format <i>without</i> asking the OP's permission, for example. I'm not trying to senselessy limit the freedom of choice of the OP here (or of anyone else for the matter), but to moderate "conflicting interests". In fact the connection the OP wanted with the Epic Builds page Devastating Rogue is left in there, at the very beginning of the post, for all to judge whether this build has anything to do with it.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!

Serioulsy what all you guys miss out is that unless you get +50 to skill points easily by items this build has the best stealth available for a dev sneaker . Ranger buffs to increase Hide (24 pts from buffs) + silence to be safe from any listeners. <br><br>It is the Real devastating Rogue because unlike the crappy build on the epic page it CAN hide from others. <br>(it has been stated that this is a pvp only build ) <br>The "build" on the epic page has an awful low hide and ms and everyone should be able to spot it quite easily,it has no speed and its ab is so low it needs to catchthe opponents ff'ed, thats why it is rather useless and sucks.<br><br>ITs a shame to see how a really great build gets teared apart by people that obvioulsy lack some knowledge when it comes to pvp and are more focused on PvM which is totally different.

The name, devastating rogue is a bioware "hall of fame" build (what else do we call that list??)  It IS a dev crit build WITH HUGE sneak attack.  That is the bioware build concept!   THis build is a dev critter with NO sneak damage.  To quote:<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Hail the Devastating Rogue. Unique, powerful, deadly. The rogue who specializes in raw power rather than in dexterity. This build makes an especially deadly warrior, and virtually anyone caught off-guard is almost certainly assured death.

Woe to the unwary who cross his path.<br><br>The uniqueness of this build is the fact that he can deal 84d6 sneak attack damage on his first attack phase, consisting of 3 attacks, if hasted. This is because of the 3 phases of combat per round of the NWN game engine, where attacks are divided into 3 parts, such that this character would get 3 attacks in the first phase (1st second), 2 attacks in the second phase (3rd second) and 2 attacks in the final phase (5th second).<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I dont get your point at all.  The real devastating rogue has NOTHING to do with stealth, with hiding.  It is about IN your face combat.  Again,<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Hail the Devastating Rogue. Unique, powerful, deadly.

Like it or not, that is HIS right.  TO post a build that has the intent of trying to put down another's IDEA isnt in the spirit of this guild.  We are here (i hope) to help each other learn and improve our JOY of this game we all love. <br><br>Now I know that sometimes people get carried away and excited and we get posts that contain off topic suggestions (see my cleric/sd/wm build if you arent sure what it means to ignore the OP build) but in the end, its a game.<br><br>THe whole thing is this: in hind sight, vision is always 20/20.  It is MUCH easier to look at someone else' idea and twink it than to create your own (for some of us).  But do we want this forum to be a bunch of "get back at 'em" builds.  You know, the "REAL" mage slayer (sorry tyr <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     ) or the "true" sith lord (sorry highlander) or, heaven forbid (pun intended), "tyr's Improved Devastating Thud with a dagger!" (that's mine).  All that the mods were trying to do is PREVENT all this (i hope).   <br><br>Do i agree with the change?  It doesnt matter.  It is them who has to answer to bioware if things get out of hand (have you ever read those stickies at the top!!  some of it is serious <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">     ).   <br><br>And just so my position is perfectly clear, the word ROGUE (in nwn) does NOT mean stealth ONLY!  It is a class, not a method of combat.  <br><br>*now i take a bended knee and fold my hands*  Let a higher power end this thread.  PLEASE!<br><br>BTW, i do like bloodmerc's hint for a name: the Devastating corner Shadow Killer!    But there would be no selling feature to that, and he'd have about 1000 looks with no posts cuz it would be true.   In the end, the build is a VERY good one.  We just all lost sight and got hung up on the details.   <br><br>Cheers<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/28/06 00:22:49 (GMT) -- TyrTemplar<br><br>This post is for general information purposes only, and does not constitute a legal opinion or render any legal advice.

Thanks for an excellent post Avado. <br><br>I will accept no further comment on this builds name in this thread, as explanations has been given and decisions made. If someone feel it must be discussed further, open a thread in general discussion. I hate to do this, but such it has become.

Not to mention the fact that monk speed not only gives it higher FF AC, but also the ability to run away, hide and come back before the Devastating Rogue has moved anywhere....oh and not to mention it can Haste itself &amp; make itself invisible...these factors in my opinion make it <b>the REAL Devastating Rogue</b> even though it has no Rogue levels.
