Of course, above and beyond all that, the best thing about him is that he's a Halfling of Doom!<br><br>The sling focus is an optional feat, but because of the halfling thrown weapons AB bonus it's a practical choice.  You get a ranged attack option that's actually at a higher AB than your dual-wielding melee option.<br><br><b>Q:  So why don't you take knockdown and improved knockdown instead of the sling focus and toughness?</b><br>A:  It was something I considered, but halflings are penalized in knockdown attempts by their size, and this character can generate sneak attacks through two creature tanks, HiPS, and darkness/ultravision.  Oh, and if lucky, by using the Grease spell.<br><br><b>Q:  Doesn't bane of enemies come pretty late in your build though?  By the time you get it, it won't be able to help you level.</b><br>A:  That's true, and it's unfortunate.  If you don't want to raise discipline over 40 you can get it earlier (much earlier in fact).  I try to arrange for a chance to raise discipline near the end of the build by habit, some people don't think it's worthwhile and depending on the environment they are probably right.  The short answer is - you can move it up if you want and not suffer too badly.<br><br><b>Q:  Are there any other tricks you thought of while creating this build?</b><br>A:  A few.  For one, you can carry a large shield to use with your sling or a single-wielded dagger for +2 to AC and no real downsides.  For another, you have stealth and trap skill buffs from your ranger spells, which can be put to good use in this build.  For a third, your Shadow Daze save DC is, I believe, 30 vs will - making it pretty practical to use on fighter and rogue types.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Yeah, another FE would probably be the best choice, but I recall reading that 5 FEs is actually not required (i believe it was cdaulepp that reported this), as you can select Bane with only 1 if you wish, as long as you have 21 RGR levels.<br><br><b>BUT:</b> don't take my word for it, as I've been accused of being a liar and making facts up to bolster my ego, so you'll have to take this with a grain of salt... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>Where I'm playing now: <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk.</a>

Pfft you're pretty much always right as far as I can recall.  I tend to trust what's in the grimoire by default when I'm planning something, and it does have a few innacuracies, particularly related to situations like this one.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Personally, I prefer to give up on epic dodge and go for Ranger 21/Assassin 17/SD 2 or the Ranger 22/Rogue 17/SD 1, which would retain epic dodge and can get bane earlier.  That said, the darkness/ultravision combo is very nasty even with only a 5D6 death attack.  Also because it takes 10 SD levels it can't be accused of being cheesy.
