I am requesting help with a build that I thought up.<br><br>Here is what I have come up with so far:<br><br>Gnome (needed racial con bonus w/o racial dex penalty)<br><br>Barbarian 24 /SD 10 /Monk6 (alignment changing is not an issue with me)<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 16 (for light weapon - maybe kamas)<br>Con 17 (figured to take odd number of Great Con to even it out somewhere along the way)<br>Int 14 (need those skill points!)<br>Wis 10<br>Cha 8<br><br>My aim is to have Epic Dodge and Epic Damage Reduction.<br><br>Originally, (to have least amount of alignment changes) i considered this lvling progression:<br><br>Barb 20 (for max pre-epic BAB)<br>make sure to meet SD prereq's<br>SD 10<br>Barb 4<br>change alignment<br>Monk 6<br><br>the problem (in the eyes of the beholder) is that If I would take a monk lvl or two or three at the beginning, then I would have free exotic weapon feat for kamas - but then I wouldn't get great BAB from 20 pre-epic lvls of Barbarian.<br><br>I am open to any and all suggestions on how to make this work for the best.<br><br>regards,<br>-Chip

Problems with this build:<br><br>Feat starved - you only have one Epic bonus feat from Barb 24, and Epic Dmg Red costs 3 Epic feats already.<br><br>High stat point requirements: 25 DEX Epic Dodge, 21 CON, combine with above.<br><br>Xp Penalty all the way through.

thx, pocketbeetle!!<br><br>hehehe, great title! =)<br><br>Nothing special about the Mod I play on, just if I have wis -1 modifier, it gives me a -1 to AC since the build has monk, correct?<br><br>Also, i will be building him all at once, so, I'm not worried about XP penalties at all, even if the lvl progression was "playable" i'm not the type to worry about XP penalties <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>i went to build it while in the mod, and forgot to get my dex up for the Epic Dodge.... DOH!<br><br>Is there anyoneelse who wants to give it a shot?<br><br>regards,<br>Chip
