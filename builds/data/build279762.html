Ok the concept here came as I was reading the manual and under Half Elf's it say's that "they are outsiders among both culture's" so I thought why not a evil hitman style guy who worked against both of his parents race's.

First off, I like the combo of Ranger/Assassin/BG. <br><br>However, I'm a little confused as to the aim of the build. I assume that you are using a melee weapon as you list stats with plate and shield, but I see no weapon focus feats, or any other way to do damage to an opponent. You state the unarmed AB, but I take it that you won't be using fists as you have no monk levels and hence attack progression/improved unarmed strike, etc. On top of that, you have only 16 strength; you're not going to hit anything.<br><br>You have plenty of potential damage, (most notably from sneak attacks/death attacks) but no way to deliver it. Even if you find a way to hit things, you can't expect to land sneak attacks with only 10 hide/MS, unless you rely entirely on KD (which would require yet more AB that you don't have); These skills are drained even further if you wear the plate and shield you list in the stats.<br><br>I also question the usefullness of only 13 assassin. Your death attack DC will suck, and the 7d6 damage bonus from death attacks can be made up for by rogue which would add the same amount from increased sneak attack damage as well as granting more skillpoints and 2 rogue bonus feats.<br><br>If assassin were to be replaced by rogue, then the use of ranger would be questionable, apart from the few buffs that drain your precious stats to cast. I would personally take fighter, for the bonus feats.<br><br>Overall, the best choice IMHO would be to go fighter 5/rogue 13/BG 22 or fighter 8/rogue 10/BG 22. I would take human, drop Divine might and charisma for strength and hence AB, take the points out of wisdom and put them where you want, I would suggest intelligence for more skillpoints. Or alternatively go dex-based for increased AC and stealth but a hit to damage, as well as going elf.<br><br>Hope these suggestions help.

All over very interesting concept. I understand that you wish to keep the entire 7 thing going, but for usefullness: Drop assassin to 10 (taking 10th assassin level on lv 37 for skill maxing) and get 25 BG levels.<br>This gains you one more epic bonus feat (weapon focus), +1d6 sneak and improved fiendish servant. However, you lose 2d6 death attack and 6 skill points.<br><br>You dont dual wield, and you dont even get improved two weapon fighting, so taking ranger above fighter seems rather useless to me, taking fighter instead postpones your assassin levels until lv 15, and BG levels until lv 9.<br><br>But I agree with Kurth that rogue would be better in your place, even though you lose all of the assassins goodness and bonuses.<br><br>5 fighter pre epic and lv 6 on lv 21 gives you both weapon focus and weapon spec, and both in epic that this low str build needs.<br><br>I mean, 32 as max AB is almost illegally low for a melee, tho you can raise it by 2 with your bulls strength.<br><br>And the total maxed hps of this build is as follows:<br>22 blackguard: 1d10=220<br>13 assassin: 1d6=78<br>5 ranger: 1d10=50<br>Con modifier: 2=80<br><br>428 hps maxed, if my (in head) calculations are correct.

I agree with everything said.  What I look for are where the stats are placed and where feats are taken.   Like it was mentioned, you str at 16 isnt very useful.  WHy add 2 to con?  then to str then to charisma!  In the past, I have built charisma builds with HUGE charisma investments (much more than 24), but in this build, it seems more important to take more str.  leaving charisma at 20 with +12 will give 32!  Even at 18 you will have 30 or +20 dam or def (which you may want to drop if you use a shield).  The choice in Great cleave..  While not going for Dev crit, DONT BOTHER!  Wasted feat.  You could take toughness in its place to get same HP that the 2 con give +1 to ab and damage!!  WOOT<br><br>From what I have seen, you are trying to do too much.  The reality is that you cannot do everything in ONE lv 40 build.  There is NO such thing as the UBER build.  Every build has its weaknessess.  Trust me on this.  I have a cleric with an evo dc on implosion of 47 at lv 22 (i play prc server almost exclusivly for those that do the math and wonder HOW the F#$k!!)  and yet, when it comes to mages, he sucks!  I also have a HUGE dev critter with insane dc and yet, sucks vs constructs!  <br><br>imvho, decide what you want and design for it.  DONT try to do too  much (which is what is done here).  Your build, in the end will be sucky.<br><br>hope that helps<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Thank You for the replies, after reading them I think this probably say's everything best.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/30/07 19:49 (GMT) -- avado<br>From what I have seen, you are trying to do too much.  <br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Anyways to K U R T H thank you for the input and Im glad you like the concept. The aim was an Half-elf hitman type that only did contracts on humans and elves. O and there was no weapon focus just using whatever's handy (except exotic weapons)<br> <br>to Cerolill: thanks it is a interesting concept if I can just refine it more. As for the ranger levels the 5 give me 2 favored enemies (Humans/Elves) while still allowing for enough levels(35) to achive both 7DA and SA .

I know you aren't going for "uber" power, but a 33 AB with his chosen weapons is pretty low. You are also wasting a lot of epic feats on stuff he doesn't need - ESF: Open locks, Epic Reputation, Iron will, etc.<br><br>He has lots of sneak damage, and he is designed to attack humans and elves, not undead or other sneak-immunes, so skip Divine Might - another 4 points isn't going to make a difference. I would start with Str 13, Dex 15, Con 10 (or 12), Wis 12, Int 14, Cha 10 (or 12). Pump Dex at every level up. You can pick whether to boost Con for HP or Cha for the save bonus.<br><br>In Epic, I would drop Divine Might, Divine Shield, both ESFs, Iron WIll and Epic Reputation for Great Dex. You should end up with Dex at 32.<br><br>I would rearrange the levels - take more BG/Ranger pre-epic and more Assassin in Epic. Pre-epic, go Ranger 9/BG 7/As 4 - this will get you to 19 BAB. To be honest, if you are going to bother with Assassin at all, I would put most of the Epic levels as Assassin to get the Death Attack DC up. I'd end up either Ranger 9/BG 17/Assassin 24 or drop 2 BG levels (losing 1 BAB due to 6 Assassin levels pre-epic) to end up Ranger 9/BG 5/As 26 (for the extra Assassin bonus feat). Either way you still end up with 14d6 sneak damage, and still get most of the Blackguard class feats.<br><br>For skills, you need Search to make Disable traps worthwhile (you can't disable them if you don't detect them first). You need a 22 search to detect up to Deadly traps, and a 16 Disable trap to disarm them. I would definitely max Hide and MS - you're an Assassin, you primary job is to sneak up on some one and hit them with a Death Attack. You can max Open Locks if you want to break into their homes.<br><br>It would look something like this:<br><br>Ranger(9), Blackguard(7), Assassin(24), Half-Elf<br><br>STR: 14<br>DEX: 15 (32)<br>CON: 10 or 12<br>WIS: 12<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 10 or 12<br><br>Hitpoints: 304 (or 344 if Con is 12)<br>Skillpoints: 244<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 22/17/30 (add +1 if Cha is 12)<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +2, Poison: +6<br>BAB: 29<br>AB (max, naked): 44 (melee), 41 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 31/34<br>Spell Casting: Ranger(2)<br><br>Disable Trap 14(16), Hide 43(54), Move Silently 43(54), Open Lock 43(54), Search 19(22), Tumble 40(51), UMD 40(40)<br><br>01: R(1): Power Attack, {Dual Wield}<br>02: R(2)<br>03: R(3): Cleave<br>04: R(4): DEX+1, (DEX=16)<br>05: R(5)<br>06: R(6): Weapon Finesse<br>07: BG(1)<br>08: BG(2): DEX+1, {Smite Good}, (DEX=17)<br>09: BG(3): Weapon Focus<br>10: BG(4)<br>11: BG(5)<br>12: BG(6): DEX+1, Blind Fight, (DEX=18)<br>13: BG(7)<br>14: R(7)<br>15: R(8): Knockdown<br>16: R(9): DEX+1, {Improved Two-Weapon Fighting}, (DEX=19)<br>17: As(1)<br>18: As(2): Improved Knockdown, {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>19: As(3)<br>20: As(4): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>21: As(5): Epic Weapon Focus<br>22: As(6)<br>23: As(7)<br>24: As(8): DEX+1, Epic Prowess, (DEX=21)<br>25: As(9)<br>26: As(10)<br>27: As(11): Armor Skin<br>28: As(12): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>29: As(13)<br>30: As(14): Great Dexterity I, Great Dexterity II, (DEX=24)<br>31: As(15)<br>32: As(16): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br>33: As(17): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=26)<br>34: As(18): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=27)<br>35: As(19)<br>36: As(20): DEX+1, Great Dexterity V, (DEX=29)<br>37: As(21)<br>38: As(22): Great Dexterity VI, (DEX=30)<br>39: As(23): Great Dexterity VII, (DEX=31)<br>40: As(24): DEX+1, (DEX=32)<br><br><br>Note that you pick up a whopping +11 to AB - that will let you hit with that first Death attack.
