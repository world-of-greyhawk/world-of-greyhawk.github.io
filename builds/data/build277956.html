I have spent most of my time in NWN learning how to make an uber build without the use of another person's build. I have been successful in making a near impossible build to kill, which i suspect would also be easy to play. So here it is.<br><br>PvM and PvP build. Playable 1 - 40.<br><br>Dwarf - Any Non-Lawful<br><br>Starting Stats (Finishing stats) :<br>Str - 16 (24)<br>Dex - 8 <br>Con - 20 (38) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif"> <br>Wis - 8<br>Int - 12 (14)<br>Cha - 6<br><br>Increase constitution every time.<br><br>Here is the level guide.

This build has a low AC, so you may wish to use a single handed weapon, and use a shield. If you want to dish out more damage (which this build can do) you go with a two handed weapon. Dual wielding is not recommended.<br><br>Naked Stats:<br>AC - 22<br>AB - +36<br>HP - Maxed can easily exceed 1000, especially with rage. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif"> <br><br>With Equipment:<br>Full plate +6<br>Tower shield +7<br>Ring of Protection +5<br>Boots of the Sun Soul +5<br>Amulet of Natural Armor +5<br><br>AC - 64<br>AB - +36<br><br>While raged your strength becomes 30, and your constitution becomes 44.<br><br>Pros: <br><br>Uber health.<br><br>Good AC if equipped right.<br><br>Good AB for a build focused on defense.<br><br>Rage.<br><br>Bard Song.<br><br>Use Magic Device.<br><br>Good self healing capabilities.<br><br>Fortitude Saves are excellent.<br><br>Dispel used against you will never harm you too bad.<br><br>Many immunities from RDD. (Immunity to sleep, paralysis, and fire.)<br><br>Decent DR (This is my reason for getting 23 levels in barbarian.)<br><br><br>Cons:<br><br>Spell Resistance is really bad. Look for SR bonus equipment. (Death magic is my biggest worry here, because most damage spells will only dent your HP.) <br><br>AB is slightly low.<br><br>Concealed, HIPS, or invisible opponents seem to frustrate this build. For magic based hiding use Mordenkainen's Disjunction from a scroll. You can use True Seeing against HIPS or invisible opponents.<br><br><br><br>In my opinion, this build has very few weaknesses. With heal scrolls or healing kits you can seem invincible against players, and go for hours in PvM without resting.<br><br>Any comments, suggestions, and tips are welcome, as this is my first build on this forum. Have fun tearing it up! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

A couple of suggestions. 1. I would go with Barbarian 28/ Bard 2/ RDD 10. I'm not sure what you get by going with RDD 15. Barbarian 24 and 28 will net you two epic bonus feats. 2. If you get STR to 25 you can pick up Mighty Rage as one of the Barbarian bonus feats. +8 to STR and CON while raging. 3. I would drop some of the Great CONs and pick up the 3 Epic Damage Reduction Feats. Which are great to have with so many HP's. I think that would give you DR 15/-. Just some suggestions to think about. Nice build.

Oh, one more thing. If you get Mighty Rage you can activate it first and then activate Greater Rage and they STACK with each other. Not sure if you knew that or not.

I would delay Bard and RDD till epic, to maximize BAB.  Also, do as Galab said - go 28 Barb, 10 RDD.  You'll trade one AC for one epic bonus feat,  2/- DR (or something like that) and some HPs.<br><br>Also, you may want to check up on your formatting, such as listing saves, skills (the exact number), and maxed HP without rage or gear.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By mantis3 on 07/04/07 23:57</span></i></p>

mantis, i appreciate the attempt, but you should look at using our format that we have ALL been using for the past 2 years or so.  Look at any of the recent builds if you arent sure.  It makes it easier for new folks to look at, and us old, cynical folks to take seriously!<br><br>Esp when you say near impossible to kill and use 15 rdd lvls..  And, im sure a heavy weapon master with dev crit OR a high crit range weapon (scrim or rapier) will be able to take you down.. and lets not even look at those scythe weildin wms.. oh my (no imm to crit!)

I like this idea, as I like bard/RDD everything dare I admit ... but an uber build? Um, .... er .... <br><br>As noted above, AB 36 is way way too low (you're simply not going to hit anything); while HPs are nice, I agree w. Avado (don't believe in HPs for the sake of Hps); honestly, more grt. str. and/or EDR would do you far better; also, why 15 RDD? 10 is the number you want. tossing the rest into barb. is great thinking (and, unless you're going bard-heavy, which you're not, then you'll also want to really consider running Barb. pre-ep which is also good thinkin' (BAB = AB). <br><br>also, as to format, in addition, you need to list all similar builds from the guild and explain how yours is different from what's come b/f (not coming down on you as you're new, and am happy to help you out this time, but next time, you can do this yourself, 'kay?

NOW, 200000 hp with that type of char BECOMES unbeatable.  The only thing with that is, HOW do you kill yourself???   Sure, no one can kill you, but so what...
