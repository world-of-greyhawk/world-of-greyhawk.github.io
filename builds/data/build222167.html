perhaps swapping scimmy to kama would be a good bet, as you would lose crit range but gain extra monk attacks, as well as use of flurry, IIRC. just a thought, the build looks good though.<br>_________________<br>Dwarves hate to be mistaken for Gnomes.

I thought about using a kama, but since it's a strength-build I think he does better with heavy armour, board and sword ...

dont you loose the extra attacks when you use a shield as a monk?<br><br>could you make this char a dexer , dualwielding kamas ... the many attacks might make up for the loss of dmg and it would be easier to bypass epic dodge - tough as dexer you get probs if you have to fight crit immune opponents.

Depends on how good the monk EQ is where you're playing this - if it can easily make up for the full plate AC and shield AC lost, then go for it and the extra attacks. Wearing Armor or Shield IIRC will negate Monk abilities including the attack progression. Otherwise I'd sitck with the sword and board and plate with the much higher crit modifier and the 4 APR, and adjust starting stats accordingly (like forgetting about WIS, if you can...)<br><br>I think though, the far high crit range on a scim (or possibly even Kukris if you like dual-wield) will make up a lot for the extra attacks from Kamas for any non crit-immunes though we might have to drag syrath in to make the calculations <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

A build like this would almost certainly be better off sword-and-boarding as a strength build it over dexing it.  As a dex character you won't really have the ability to generate significant damage with a build like this.<br><br>Most dex characters rely on sneak attack, buff spells (darkfire/flame weapon) or all else failing, 1d20 monk fists to hurt things.  This guy has none of those.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Shivers run down my spine. It is a fine build, and i like STR builds, but a Dwarf with scimitar? Argh. No room for waraxe, but use battleaxe, or even better, warhammer. Thanks. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

If what you fight against has high enough AC a huge crit range doesn't do any good, cause you still need to hit 'em in order to crit 'em
