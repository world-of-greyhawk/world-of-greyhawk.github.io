Comments by Jushak Brimstone:<br><br>This build, if life is maxed, has a respectable HP of 630 (870 if if using +12 worth CON enhancers) Which definitely ain't bad. If Dwarf would be used instead of human (which I think has been used) it would be 670, thought Prestige Class bug would give you EXP penalty after the BG passes the Barbarian levels. This is avoided with human and half-elf.<br><br>EDIT: Forgot to congratulate HolyBeef for making great build, also saving me the trouble of posting it myself (I was just about to build this build myself, but HolyBeef was faster... )<br>_________________<br>"Lavamancers use three aspects of magic to make a golem: Transmutation; to mold the golem, Necromancery; to bind a soul to control the golem, and Evocation; to blast the damn thing on fire."<br>- Jushak Firestone - Grim Lavamancer

So let me get this straight. When you activate terrifying rage an opponent has to make a will save against your Intimidate DC which for simplicity sake we will just say is 43. So pretty much the opponent has to beat 43 + 1d20 or else be feared for a few rounds. It seems to me that it's sorta the same thing as a Dragon's aura. If immunity to fear protects against this wouldn't any spell that grants mind immunity such as clarity work also? Also how long does the terrifying rage last and how many times can you activate it? Intimidate is a Chrasima based skill so you might want to boost your Char a little.<br><br>Terrifying rage sounds neat but I need to know exactly how it works and its reliability before I build a character focusing on it.

My master of scare tactics build uses terrifying rage as well. It works very well. I have to rebuild it to test ont he guild servers though for giggles. I think the book is wrong about the needing epic bard though. I'll have to double check.

Ok, I just did a few tests with this build trying to come up with some way to all the listed feats. And I must say, the results I got are way beyond my comprehension. <br><br>I started with taking 10 lvls of Barbarian to get Cleave, Bab 6+ and 5 points in Hide. Then 22 lvls of Blackguard and took all the remaining pre-epic feats and boost both my strength and constitution to 21+. Now at lvl 33, I took my 11th Barbarian lvl and was waiting for taking Mighty Rage (prereq: Con 21, Str 21 and Greater Rage). Well, for some reason it was not choosable. So I took another of the Epic Feats and continued taking Barbarian lvls all the way until I was 14 Barb/ 22 Blackguard. Then I started taking Bg lvls again until lvl 39 when I again took Barbarian. Would you know it, still no Mighty Rage. BUT, both Terrifying and Thundering Rage were choosable. Odd? Yes. Both of these feats are supposed to need 21 Barbarian lvls...<br><br>Conclusion: Don't trust the manual...

Yes, I have messed around with this build somewhat myself.  You need to have 21 lvs of Barb for Mighty Rage, even though it never mentions that in the manual.  I had managed to get in all the feats the original poster was talking about, well, at least what I thought he was talking about.  I tested out with normal plate and wep in Novice to Epic Character Builder.  I wish I woulda saved everything, but I wasn't really that impressed with the overall character, so didnt bother saving.  I believe I ended up 25 Barb/15 BG to get all the feats though. Should mention I didn't get Dev Crit til right at the end either.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DarkStar27909 on 01/09/05 16:21</span></i></p>

You need to have 21 lvs of Barb for Mighty Rage, even though it never mentions that in the manual.  I had managed to get in all the feats the original poster was talking about, well, at least what I thought he was talking about.  I tested out with normal plate and wep in Novice to Epic Character Builder.  I wish I woulda saved everything, but I wasn't really that impressed with the overall character, so didnt bother saving.  I believe I ended up 25 Barb/15 BG to get all the feats though. Should mention I didn't get Dev Crit til right at the end either.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Yes i have done the same thing as you, i noticed you HAVE to be 25Barb/15BlackGuard to get Mighty Rage. <br>I was pretty pissed at this build because i tested it in HOTU Chapter 1. I did all of the leveling right there and thought to test Terrifying Rage. I rested, and the Drow Asassin showed up and i activated my rage. I wasn't impressed with the results. The Drow was only affected by it half of the time. The Drow was only lvl 15 (by my guess) and if it didn't work half of the time, what real good is this build? The Terrifying Rage MAKES this build supposedly, without it, what good would the Blackguard lvls do? (for sneak attack) and if it cant affect a level 15, how is it supposed to affect anyone lets say in PvP. Oh Well, it was a great concept, i can give you that.<br>Peace- RyNo

I was just searching for BG builds and I stumbled across this one, Its quite similar to something im working on at the moment, but anyway, there is a reason for this post:<br><br>Ive managed to take terrifying rage feat with only 17 levels of barbarian in epic levels but not with 8 barbarian levels in epic levels, so it would seem that the actual prerequsite for terrifying rage is the greater rage feat.

I've tested it quite a bit.  Terrifying rage is available at lvl 15 barbarian as long as you're already an epic character.  I think, but in this case can't remember if I've tested it, that thundering rage is available at the same point.  Reason being, I think thundering rage is a waste on most servers as it is an 'on top of crit' damage.  Back to the point, I'm wondering if the person who tested their terrifying rage had enough points in intimidate.<br><br>Anyhow - 15 is the lowest I've tested it at.
