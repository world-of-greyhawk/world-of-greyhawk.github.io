OK, after some great input by the members of this fine guild, I have reworked the character.  Try this one on for size:<br><br>Dwarf, Lawful Neutral<br><br>STR 8<br>DEX 10<br>CON 18<br>INT 18<br>WIS 10<br>CHR 6<br><br>Levels in this order:<br>Wizard x 3<br>Pale Master x 10<br>Wizard x 6<br>CoT x 1<br>Wizard x 3<br>Pale Master x 2<br>CoT x 2<br>Wizard x 2<br>CoT x 1<br>Pale Master x 4<br>Wizard x 6<br><br>Raise INT at levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 36, 40.<br>Raise CON at levels 20, 24, 28, 32.<br><br>Feats:<br>Level 1: Combat Casting<br>Level 3: Spell Penetration<br>Level 6: Greater Spell Penetration<br>Level 9: Maximize Spell<br>Level 12: Still Spell<br>Level 15: Toughness, Extend Spell<br>Level 18: Weapon Focus<br>Level 21: Heavy Armor Proficiency, Epic Spell Penetration<br>Level 24: Auto Still Spell I<br>Level 26: Auto Still Spell II<br>Level 27: Auto Still Spell III<br>Level 30: Epic Damage Reduction I &amp; II<br>Level 31: Improved Combat Casting<br>Level 33: Epic Spell<br>Level 34: Epic Spell<br>Level 35: Great INT I<br>Level 36: Epic Damage Reduction III<br>Level 39: Epic Toughness I<br>Level 40: Great INT II<br><br>Skills: Keep Concentration, Spellcraft, and Tumble maxed.  Discipline is good too, ending at around 33.  I also put points into Persuade, Search, and Spot, and maxed Lore.  You should have plenty of points to play with.<br><br>The main difference from the previous build is a lack of Auto Quicken.  Emrill pointed out that Auto Quicken is useless if the character is permanently Hasted.  Haste items are pretty easy to get ahold of (I recommend finding a weapon with Haste on it), so why waste those Feat selections?<br><br>This is a pure caster build.  As an FYI, I was able to cast 15 IGMS, 4 of which were Maxed.  I could have cast 5, but I thought I should have a Time Stop ready too.  But being a 20th level Wizard, he's got some great versatility.<br>_________________<br>-------------------------------<br>"What do you fear most in the world?"<br>"The possibility that love is not enough."<br>-- Major Garland Briggs, Twin Peaks

I'm trying it out on a PW, he's in the low 20s right now. It's a good build, my HP and AC are monstrous for a caster, but it does take quite a bit of work to start out with, since you're stuck at Caster Level 3 until level 14..

Thanks.  I too tried it out and discovered that it was too hard to take all 10 PM levels at once, so alternated a little bit more between Wizard and PM.  I'm impressed that you have been able to carry it that far as is.<br><br>The level allocation I'm currently using myself from 1-20 is:<br>Wizard x 3<br>PM x 3<br>Wizard x 1<br>PM x 2<br>Wizard x 1<br>PM x 2<br>Wizard x 1<br>PM x 2<br>Wizard x 1<br>PM x 1<br>Wizard x 2<br>CoT x1<br><br>The end result is the same, but a little more balanced.

Yeah, it was pretty tough for quite awhile. But hearing the "OMGWTF HOW COME YOU HAVE MORE HP THAN ME? You're a... caster, and five levels below me!" comments was more than worth it. Still in the mid-20s, but I took the build today into the Halls of Advanced Training and wasted the jacked-up-difficulty opponent you can choose to fight (Hameune Leung Chung or whatever the hell his name is) without much trouble at all, and while limiting myself to gear I could attain on the server I play on. I decided to trade Empower for Epic Toughness I, though.

Very sorry for res-ing a 6 year old thread, I love this build currently playing it on my current RP server the only problem is they have a "rule of 5" rule which means I have to have a minimum 5 lvls in a class. What is the least distructive way to mod this build to get the 5th lvl CoT????<br><br>Thanks for any help.

PM gives a bonus feat at lvl 16, Wizard gives a Bonus Feat at 20, CoT 5 gives you nothing. If you try to mess with the level spread, I'd say you'd be better off not using this build at all.However, if you're set on doing this, go WIZ 18 PM 16 CoT 6 and get another CoT Bonus Feat, but it'd have to be selected from a different list and also you'd lose many high-level spells per day...<br><br>Take it EZ!
