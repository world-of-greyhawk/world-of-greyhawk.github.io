I am also looking for ideas on builds for Pickpocketing and Disarming. Preferably in the same build. in regards to pickpocketing the builds would have to be able to hit a DC of 100 to pickpocket. Disarming has no DC however. Some of my current ideas were surounded around Monks for their speed to run in Disarm Pickup and run out. Or the same theory for pickpocketing. The other idea i had was surounded around the Bards ability to buff skills with BardSong... I am curious to hear other peoples ideas on this though.<br><br>-Cpu

Dragonshape monks make for great disarmers. The size of the unarmed weapon coupled with the number of attacks creates a large net to steal the weapon.

A large weapon wielder (greatsword/two-bladed sword/dire mace) with high AB and able to cast true strike (even from a scroll *hint hint* can make the best disarmer IMHO. So. My vote goes for bard with good song (for boosting skills like pickpocketing) and UMD (for casting true strike from a scroll), you can do him dex based multiclass him WM to improve his AB (and BAB if pre-epic).<br><br>Bard/WM/Rogue sounds good here.<br>_________________<br>HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh.
