The Introspective Necromancer Halfling Bard 4 / Fighter 12 / Pale Master 24<br><br>I started thinking about building a build with the most PM levels possible and still having 4 attacks per round. This seemed the best path. It gets superior damage and extremely high AC, and its AB isn't bad, either. Also, I really wanted to see what the halfling bone arm looks like. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Starting Attributes<br>Str 14<br>Dex 12<br>Con 14<br>Wis 8<br>Int 14<br>Cha 14<br><br>Probably not playable 1-40 due to XP penalty, but it works PvM or PvP<br>Alignment: Non-good<br><br>Attribute Bonuses<br>Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36 and 40 go to strength<br><br>Leveling<br>01: Bard (1) Luck of Heroes<br>02: Fighter (1) Weapon Focus (Scimitar)<br>03: Fighter (2) Toughness, Knockdown<br>04: Fighter (3)<br>05: Fighter (4) Weapon Specialization (Scimitar)<br>06: Bard (2) Disarm<br>07: Bard (3)<br>08: PM (1)<br>09: PM (2) Called Shot<br>10: PM (3)<br>11: PM (4)<br>12: PM (5) Resist Energy: Fire<br>13: Fighter (5)<br>14: Fighter (6) Improved Critical (Scimitar)<br>15: Fighter (7) Resist Energy: Electricity<br>16: Fighter (8) Improved Knockdown<br>17: PM (6)<br>18: Fighter (9) Resist Energy: Sonic<br>19: Fighter (10) Improved Disarm<br>20: Fighter (11)<br>21: PM (7) Epic Weapon Focus (Scimitar)<br>22: PM (8)<br>23: PM (9)<br>24: PM (10) Epic Prowess<br>25: PM (11)<br>26: PM (12)<br>27: PM (13) Armor Skin, Epic Energy Resistance: Cold<br>28: PM (14)<br>29: PM (15)<br>30: PM (16) Great Strength I, Epic Spell: Greater Ruin<br>31: PM (17)<br>32: PM (18)<br>33: PM (19) Great Strength II, Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor<br>34: PM (20)<br>35: PM (21)<br>36: PM (22) Great Strength III, Epic Spell: Epic Warding<br>37: PM (23)<br>38: PM (24)<br>39: Fighter (12) Great Strength IV, Epic Weapon Specialization (Scimitar)<br>40: Bard (4)<br><br>Final Attributes:<br>Str 28<br>Dex 12<br>Con 14<br>Wis 8<br>Int 14<br>Cha 14<br><br>Final Saves (Vs.

Hmm, quite nice, AB is very high to have so much Pale Master... It's a good melee with Arcane Epic Spells if I understood correctly... which should be rather good, especially Epic Warding, but Epic Mage Armor gets wasted with that +5 equipment... I would consider taking so many PM levels excessive... AC is good too.

Why be a halfling in this build?  To two-hand the scimitar, or get the small stature bonuses?  If you're two-handing a scimitar, why are you listing an AC stat that includes a shield?  And I'm not sure halflings can use tower shields at all - last time I tried it, they weren't allowed to.  Also, with only 15 UMD, I'm reasonably sure you can't equip boots of the sun soul +5... I could be wrong on that, since I haven't tested... just an impression I get.<br><br>You might want to try dwarf as your race instead - you'd have more hitpoints, avoid the exp penalty, be able to use a tower shield and one-hand scimitar like you seem to want, and the tradeoff, a drop in Cha, is probably negligible.  Unless it's been fixed since I've been away, PM levels don't give you new bard or sorcerer spells known, just spells/day (ie, in this build you'll only have the known spells of a level 4 bard, even though you should have the spells/day of a level 16 bard).  And as far as I'm aware, the spells would be cast as if you were level 4 as regards duration, etc.<br><br>It's a good concept for a build, but I think you need to refine it or at least test your equipment strategy, since it seems like you didn't.  Even if you stay halfling, you might want to consider getting rid of some points in charisma since they aren't doing you much good.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Well, don't forget either that the halfling and gnome penalty stat is strength.  Since you're at -2 to strength, you are at -1 AB and damage compared to a large-sized race.<br><br>The small stature AB bonus makes the character's AB a wash in a strength build, it doesn't actually improve it.<br><br>So subbing in a dwarf for this build, would start you with a 16 strength, 16 con, and 12 cha without having to siphon points from anywhere.  Then if you don't change anything else you would then end on a 30 strength, and your AB would be maintained (the -1 from small stature being replaced by +1 from strength).  If you still want to two-hand, you can, and you'd still be gaining in the hitpoints department.<br><br>As for why AC is better than damage for a melee fighter in my opinion - in NWN PvE, you tend to fight cannon fodder enemies in large numbers.  The danger of these enemies is usually not in their ability to kill you but rather in their ability to wear you down over time and make you use up spells, potions, scrolls, and other consumable items.  Having a high AC when you're a melee greatly reduces the ability of cannon fodder to inflict attrition on you so that you are closer to full power when you reach the next boss battle.<br><br>Bosses tend to be dangerous due to special abilities, on the other hand, which makes the boss battles the place to then use up your consumables in order to negate their advantages and secure victory for yourself.<br><br>That said, everybody's got their own style of fighting and an at least slightly different environment.  I build around my own experiences and style.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
