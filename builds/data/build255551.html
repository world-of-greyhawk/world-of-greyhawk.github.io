This build was the product of a discussion regarding Clerics not being as strong as a Melee Mage as far as staying power.  I begged to differ in that thread, and commented that Clerics are "Diesel-driven Dynamoes of Destruction".  Case in point:<br><br>This build combines the strength of the Half-orc and the undeniable strength of a 26th level Cleric, and then stirs vigorously until he has 31 Divine Powers per day, ESF Taunt, Devastating Critical, still lands on a 30 Strength, and has such an ungodly array of wickedness that this build should be outlawed (actually, I think it is on most PWs....).  <br><br><br><b>The Rune-Scarred War Machine</b><br><br>Race: Half-orc<br>Alignment: Chaotic Neutral<br>Playable: 1-40 PvM<br><br><br>Cleric26/Barbarian4/Champion of Torm10<br><br><b>Attributes</b><br>Str18 (30)<br>Int12<br>Wis15 (20)<br>Dex8<br>Con14<br>Chr6<br><br><b>Level Guide</b><br>1 Barbarian1, WF: Battle Axe*<br>2 Cleric1, Strength &amp; Trickery<br>3 Cleric2, Extend Spell<br>4 Cleric3, Wis16<br>5 Cleric4<br>6 Cleric5, Blindfighting<br>7 Cleric6<br>8 Cleric7, Wis17<br>9 Cleric8, Power Attack<br>10 Cleric9<br>11 Cleric10<br>12 Cleric11, Improved Crit: Battle Axe*, Wis18<br>13 CoT1<br>14 Cleric12<br>15 Cleric13, Cleave<br>16 Cleric14, Str19<br>17 CoT2, Great Cleave**<br>18 Cleric15, Quicken Spell<br>19 Cleric16<br>20 Cleric17, Str20<br>21 Barb2, Great Str I<br>22 CoT3<br>23 CoT4, Great Wis I<br>24 CoT5, Great Str II, Str23<br>25 CoT6, Overwhelming Critical: Battle Axe*<br>26 CoT7<br>27 Cleric18, Great Str III<br>28 CoT8, Devastating Crit: Battle Axe*, Str25<br>29 Cleric19<br>30 Barb3, Epic Weapon Focus: Battle Axe*<br>31 Cleric20<br>32 Cleric21, Str26<br>33 Cleric22, ESF: Taunt<br>34 Cleric23, Armor Skin<br>35 CoT9<br>36 Cleric24, Great Str IV, Str28<br>37 Cleric25<br>38 Cleric26, Great Wis II<br>39 Barb4, Great Str V<br>40 CoT10, Epic Prowess, Str30<br><br>*denotes that Scimitar or any martial weapon can be chosen<br>** to make this build legal for your server, drop 5 more points into Concentration, replace the Dev Crit line of Feats for CC, ICC, Empower/Maximize Spell and Silent<br><br><br><b>Combat Vitals</b><br>AB: 39/34/29<br>Divine Power AB: 44/39/34/44<br>Buffed AB w/Taunt: 71/66/61/71 (GMW, DP, DF, Bless, Aid, Prayer, Battletide, Bulls)<br>AC: 26 <br>HP: 428<br><br><b>Skills</b><br>Concentration: 20<br>Discipline: 40 (50)<br>Taunt: 43 (51)<br>Tumble: 20 (40)<br><br><b>Saves</b><br>Fort: 32<br>Will: 30<br>Reflex: 22<br><br><b>The Divine Power of Gruumsh:</b> observe the number of Divine Power Switches available:<br><br>3rd: 7 Normal<br>4th: 7 Extended<br>5th: 7 Extended <br>7th: 5 Quickened <br>8th: 5 Quickened <br>______<br>Total: <b>31 Divine Powers</b> total per day without items/buffs.<br>Note: Battletide can also be Quickened into 9th level slots if one doesn't use the UEFs.<br><br><b>Advantages</b><br>Undispellable buffs<br>Improved Invisibility<br>Huge Damage potential/High Amount of Divine Power spells<br>Good Taunt skill to harry Arcane Casters<br>Half-orc Clerics of Gruumsh are high on "cool" factor<br><br><b>Disadvantages</b><br>*Probably too powerful for most low-modest magic PWs<br>*Low on skill points (but still flexible, as Taunt isn't crucial to the build, and KD Immunity items are often available making Discipline non-essential)<br>*Base AC slightly low due to Tumble being cross-classed, but easily mitigated by Cleric26<br>*Mediocre Reflex save<br>*Low Concentration, but can be mitigated by going CC/ICC in place of the Dev Crit path.

Great job as usual, Griz.<br><br>I've never seen this particular build, but in low magic PW's, clerics are UNDENIABLY the powerhouses.  With a few spells they equip themselves with +5 armor/shield/weapon (with flaming) and then cast divine power and fight as well as a warrior.<br><br>When they get hurt, they heal themselves.  When they get attacked by magic, they respond in kind and also have the advantage of spell resistance.<br><br>Kudos to you!  Hope to get some more free time to actually play on Greyhawk again (darn dental school is kicking my rump at the moment).

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">   !<br><br>As a cleric lover, this one is up there on the list of the best (for melee power)!

This is the result of provoking the Dwarflord by saying Clerics ain't as good as Mages. Awesomely well done Master Dwarflord, show 'em how wrong they are. 'Tis a fearful machine of destruction, indeed.<br><br>The Quicken Spell trick for DP slots is cool, but I think 21 uses a day is more than enough (especially since 14 uses are extended, 52 rounds each), I'd go with Empower Spell instead.

Very nice, Grizz. Good to see another 1/2 Orc-based build to add to the collection.<br><br>*edit* Something else occurs to me: if you're in an environment where you have to drop the Dev Crit line of feats, trade them for AutoQuicken. Then you can cast all your spells as Quickened, which takes care of your Heal concerns (or any others for that matter).

I like this build; could you possibly post a non-dev crit version for those of us on restricted PWs.  Like the suggestion of autoquicken for a non-DC version.  This one looks fun to play throughout as well.  So many seem designed to max so late in life, this one grows well.

But in worlds where permahaste isn't available or severely in short supply, it's probably worth the wait.  What I would do is drop Taunt altogether from the build and get Spellcraft up to 35, Concentration up to 25, and the remainder to go into Discipline since he ran a few short from topping it out.  I'll go ahead and post what that will look like since I've been getting several PMs on how to do the build without Devcrit.<br><br>The end result is that he gets better saves (as a result of Spellcraft) and now casts everything Quickened.  I still found it necessary to incorporate Concentration into the build since Quickened spells still aren't immune to normal disruptions.<br><br><b>The War Machine of Gruumsh ( <i>AutoQuicken Version (non Dev Crit)</i> )</b><br><br>Race: Half-orc<br>Alignment: Chaotic Neutral<br>Playable: 1-40 PvM<br><br><br>Cleric26/Barbarian4/Champion of Torm10<br><br><b>Attributes</b><br>Str18 (30)<br>Int12<br>Wis15 (20)<br>Dex8<br>Con14<br>Chr6<br><br><b>Level Guide</b><br>1 Barbarian1, WF: Battle Axe*<br>2 Cleric1, Strength &amp; Trickery<br>3 Cleric2, Extend Spell<br>4 Cleric3, Wis16<br>5 Cleric4<br>6 Cleric5, Blindfighting<br>7 Cleric6<br>8 Cleric7, Wis17<br>9 Cleric8, Empower Spell<br>10 Cleric9<br>11 Cleric10<br>12 Cleric11, Quicken, Wis18<br>13 CoT1<br>14 Cleric12<br>15 Cleric13, Toughness, <br>16 Cleric14, Str19<br>17 Cleric15<br>18 Cleric16, Improved Crit<br>19 Cleric17<br>20 Cleric18, Str20<br>21 Barb2, Great Str I<br>22 CoT2, Great Wis I<br>23 CoT3, <br>24 CoT4, Armor Skin, Great Str II, Str23<br>25 CoT5<br>26 CoT6, EWF: Battle Axe<br>27 CoT7, Auto Quicken I<br>28 CoT8, Auto Quicken II, Str24<br>29 Cleric19<br>30 Barb3, ESF: Concentration<br>31 Cleric20<br>32 Cleric21, Str25<br>33 Cleric22, Great Str IV<br>34 Cleric23, Auto Quicken III<br>35 CoT9<br>36 Cleric24, Great Str V, Str28<br>37 Cleric25<br>38 Cleric26, Great Wis II<br>39 Barb4, Great Str VI<br>40 CoT10, Epic Prowess, Str30<br><br><br><b>Combat Vitals</b><br>AB: 40/35/30<br>Divine Power AB: 45/40/35/45<br>Buffed AB w/Taunt: <br>AC: 26 <br>HP: 476<br><br><b>Skills</b><br>Concentration: 25 (37)<br>Discipline: 42 (52)<br>Tumble: 20 (40)<br>Spellcraft: 35<br><br><b>Saves</b><br>Fort: 32 (39)<br>Will: 31 (38)<br>Reflex: 22 (29)<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

He doesn't have any Discipline, so you would be vulnerable to Disarm/Improved Disarm and Knockdowns.  His AC isn't particulary high, so you depend on items, and while his SR would be high enough to fend off your weaker casters, pure or near pure casters would still take him out with some Bigby's and Ike Yikes.  While he has a comfortable naked Fort save of 32, one would still want that a tad higher against other dev-critters.  <br><br>So to answer your question, I don't know, but one can make a reasoned guess that works wonders in PvM isn't always the same in PvP.  I never build characters to take on other characters, but it would be an intersting experiment to see how well he performs.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
