This permits people to judge them on a level playing field and understand how they're put together. <br><br>Rather than listing a bunch of feats in a paragraph, write out the leveling of the build, level by level, so we understand what your plan is and how it can be improved.<br><br>For example:<br>1 Rogue 1 Dodge<br>2 Fighter 1 Weapon Finesse<br>3 Rogue 2 Weapon Focus: Short Sword<br>Etc, etc, etc<br><br>Another thing is that every post here assumes mundane (non-magic) items when posting final stats. So don't include your +10 Plate Mail of l33tness when calculating final AC, just put the AC from a naked character.
