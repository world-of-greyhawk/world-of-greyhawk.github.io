I searched with Pulse Cap's wonderful little search engine and found nothing at all like this, which somewhat surprises me. Anyhow, this came about while I was thinking about the old 2nd Edition Cleric/Ranger and also while reading (and responding to) a couple threads on the boards about Ranger and HS FEs. Without further ado, I present the Harper Lumberjack (that was Grizzled_Dwarflord's suggestion for the name, and it tickled me fancy!)<br><br>Ranger 23/CLC 12/HS 5<br><br><b>Playable from level 1, PvM.</b><br><br>Human, any non-evil<br><br>STR 16 (30)<br>DEX 12 (14)<br>CON 14<br>INT 12<br>WIS 14 (16)<br>CHA 8<br><br>1 )RGR1: Weapon Focus/ Iron Will/ Favored Enemy:Undead<br>2 )CLC1<br>3 )CLC2: Extend Spell<br>4 )CLC3: STR (17)<br>5 )CLC4<br>6 )RGR2: Lightning Reflexes<br>7 )RGR3<br>8 )RGR4: STR (18)<br>9 )CLC5: Empower Spell<br>10)RGR5: Favored Enemy:Constructs<br>11)CLC6<br>12)RGR6: Improved Critical/ STR (19)<br>13)RGR7<br>14)RGR8<br>15)RGR9: Toughness<br>16)RGR10: Favored Enemy:Elementals/ STR (20)<br>17)CLC7<br>18)RGR11: Alertness<br>19)RGR12<br>20)CLC8: STR (21)<br><br>21)RGR13: Epic Weapon Focus<br>22)HS1: GRT DEX I (13)<br>23)HS2<br>24)CLC9: GRT STR I (22)/ WIS (15)<br>25)CLC10<br>26)RGR14<br>27)HS3: GRT STR II (23)<br>28)RGR15: Epic Prowess/ WIS (16)<br>29)RGR16<br>30)RGR17: GRT STR III (24)<br>31)CLC11<br>32)HS4: STR (25)<br>33)RGR18: GRT STR IV (26)<br>34)RGR19<br>35)RGR20: Favored Enemy: Aberration<br>36)CLC12: GRT STR V (27)/ STR (28)<br>37)HS5: GRT DEX II (14)<br>38)RGR21<br>39)RGR22: GRT STR VI (29)<br>40)RGR23: Bane of Enemies/ STR (30)<br><br>Max HPs: 476<br><br>Naked AC: 20<br>In mundane plate and tower shield: 29<br>Fully buffed with stacking Cat's, Empowered Cat's, Magic Vestment on armor, and wearing Padded Armor (for dual-wielding): between 28 and 32.<br>With the stacking Cat's spells, there are a ton of armor combos that will give him good AC, even when dual-wielding.<br><br>AB: +42 (+40 dual-wielding)<br><br>Saves (vs spells):<br>Fort: 26 (34)<br>Refl: 20 (28)<br>Will: 25 (33)<br><br>+2 vs traps (Deneir's Eye)<br>+2 vs mind-affecting (LLiira's Heart)<br>+2 boost on all saves for 5 turns 1x/day (Tymora's Smile)<br><br>Skills (234 skill points)<br><br>Discipline: 43<br>Tumble: 40<br>Persuade: 8<br>Lore: 6<br>Search: 4<br>Spellcraft: 39<br>Set Trap: 42<br>Disable Trap: 1<br>Listen: 43<br>Open Lock: 1<br>5 points left over.<br><br>Cleric spells will serve well for boosting AB and for defense.

I suggest any crit-immune creatures for the FE feats.<br><br>His damage output can be quite effective as well, even against non-favored enemies:<br><br>+10 STR bonus, Darkfire, base weapon damage, various Cleric boosts.<br><br>AB can be augmented with Empowered Bull's, Bless, Aid, Divine Power, Battletide, etc. to reach quite respectable heights.<br><br>A couple of suggestions for options with this build:<br><br>You could trade Imp Crit for KD. You could also drop Imp Crit altogether, move Iron Will up slightly and take Exotic at level 1. This will allow you to use any weapon in the game (and I have an image in my head of this character with a Dire Mace). Drop Imp Crit <i>and</i> Toughness and take Exotic and Called Shot. There are a ton of options.<br><br>In epic, if you think you need more AC, drop 2 GRT STR feats and move Epic Prowess into a regular feat slot, pick up Armor Skin in another. This will give you one less on AB and damage, but give +2 to AC and allow a fifth FE.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 09/22/05 13:56</span></i></p>

I find builds like this quite useful when they have the flexibility and capacity to where any armour they want and still have the same AC.

i think i missed this in the post, but what domains would you take in this build.  is there any one in particular that you find/found useful?  its probably in there, but i couldn't see it, so please excuse my asking if it is in there.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>i really like this build.  rangers are good! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif"> <br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>Do not meddle in the affairs of Dragons, for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.
