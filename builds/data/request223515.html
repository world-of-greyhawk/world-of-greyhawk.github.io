Fair enough.<br><br>Could you perhaps give a list of what you'd like to have? For example,<br><br><ul><br><li>Epic Dodge<br></li><li>Epic Warding + Greater Ruin<br></li><li>Enough to push through standard SR<br></li><li>At least 38 AB<br></li></ul><br><br>stuff like that <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   As detailed as you can go, please.<br><br>Also, are there any restrictions (on multiclassing, rest or so) in where you'll be playing this? It would be nice to know.

As for Epic Mage Armor, it depends on the gear you have available. You get +5 AC over four different AC types (+5 Dodge, +5 Armor, +5 Deflection, and +5 Natural? - not sure of the last type) Since Dodge is the only one that stacks, if you have +5 items that give you the other types, EMA may not be worth the investment.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;focusing in evocation/enchanment</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>This means 6 feats (4 pre-epic and 2 epic) is you want Epic Spell Focus in both. Again, if you going with the character as mainly a caster (i.e. focussing on INT as much as possible), it may be worth the investment. If not, itmay be a waste of feats.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;going 12 rogue 1 shadowdancer and 7 wiz pre epic</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>This is not optimal for your BAB. This distribution will result in a BAB of +12. If you go with Rogue 12/SD 4/WIZ 4, you'll have a BAB of +14. Much better if you plan on being a sneaky melee type.<br><br>If you're going to the caster with a bit of sneak capability, then the R 12/SD 1/WIZ 7 should be fine.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;as you can see im not to good at this so any pointers would be a great help</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>No problem. It takes some practice to balance your wants and needs with what must be sacrificed. Just keep asking questions and posting information on what you want and I'm sure you'll end up with something to your liking.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

I can tell you this. If you want focus in Rapiers,1 feat, dual-wielding(3 feats) and spell focus 2 schools (4 feats) pre-epic, you need at least 5 wizard to even have enough feats for those. But to get SD you need Dodge and mobility to. SO, to get all those feats pre epic you need 15 wizard. Good luck getting epic dodge by lvl 26, or even have decent AB. Max BAB by lvl 20 will be 11 or 12. You have to give up on something. Or take pre epic feats epic.
