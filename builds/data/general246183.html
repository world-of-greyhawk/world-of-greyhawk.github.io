If you were to play a male Drow, what class(es) do you think would be most fun to RP? Why?

Having fun RPing is too subjective, I can't call judgement on something like that.<br><br>For what I know of Drows (which isn't <i>that</i> much), they can be good casters and melees, but by any means they are prone to have magic resistance, so I think of Monk/Fighter or something like that, no need for extreme SRs, but some at least, although I don't figure drows fighting unarmed or with kamas... they are also know to worship the Spider Queen deity (I think, or something like that), which also makes it sound like a Cleric, and take in account that I am <b>not</b> saying that a Fighter/Monk/Cleric is good just because I know your server details <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">

RP a drow!!  Why would you want to do that!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>I mean, why would you want to rp one when you could actually BE ONE  ( <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "169671", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> )<br><br>It was an old build I did that tried to make the drow shape the main form that you lived in.

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  nothing RPs a Drow better than a Drow!!!<br><br>I think avado answered your question like no other could, shifter is definitely the best class to RP a drow. However, you only have 30 levels, so tweaking is required, besides in your build you take some scythe feats for the Risen Lord, get rid of those for your build Okembour. Druid/Shifter/CoT is nice.

Made up my mind. And no, it isn't a Shifter.<br><br>I would be living in the Underdark and eventually have to de-shift. That wouldnt be pleasent now would it?<br><br>((Drow are out tracking an escaped prisoner, and have to stop and make camp to rest. They take turns resting while the others keep watch, and when it reaches my turn in the cycle to rest... what do I say? 'No Thank You'?))<br><br>I would get torn apart when discovered. Probably sacrificed to Lolth. Heheh.<br><br>But now, I have to keep my idea s secret or 4SakN over there is going to figure out my secret identity! I cant have that. <br><br>Thanks for listening to me ramble. Toodles.

Well in 2nd ed., males could not be clerics and females could not be wizards/sorcerers.  Among the drow the clerics of Lolth are feared, and among their enemies the wizards and sorcerers are probably feared more.  Hence while drow society is matriarchal, the wizards are more or less left to their own devices and granted a degree of autonomy.  If you don't want females bossing you around all the time, I suggest you consider a wizard or sorcerer as a primary class (you might even organize the other wizards and sorcerers and stage a revolt as the denizens of Chad Nassar did).  I would avoid clerics, paladins, druids, blackguards, rangers (the drow have souts but they are more likely fighter/rogues than rangers) and champions of torm as they are divine classes and unlikely for a male.  Because drow society is in an almost constant cold war state where each house is trying to weaken the other houses. Rogue and assassin would be good choices too.  Because many arguements are settled by duels, fighter and weapon master would good choices too.<br><br>Hence I suggest a pure wizard or pure sorcerer, followed by a wizard/rogue (which can be done fairly well in 30 levels), a wizard/AA, a fighter/rogue or a fighter/WM.<br><br>Hope that helps.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
