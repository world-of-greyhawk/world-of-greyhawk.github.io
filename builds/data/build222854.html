Neverwinter nights has been out for a while and most builds has been done. I wanted something somewhat new, so I decided on an unarmed fighter build. <br>After completion, I have realised that this build will be unfit for most servers because of it's low damage. The PW I play on has glove damage in the 3d20 range at level 40, so I could easily live with only a d4 natural damage.<br>It has a high number of attacks, self concealment 5, decent AB, decent HP (for a dex build), low damage, low saves.<br><br>This is also my first build displayed here, feedback would be nice.<br><br><b>playable 1 - 40 PvM</b><br><br>Race: halfling<br>Alignment: lawful neutral<br><br><br>str 10<br>dex 20 (32)<br>con 14<br>int 10<br>wis 10<br>cha  8<br><br><br>1 Monk 1 - Luck of heroes<br>2 Fighter 1 - #weapon finesse<br>3 Fighter 2 - lightning reflexes, #weapon focus (unarmed)<br>4 Fighter 3 - +1 dex<br>5 Fighter 4 - #weapon spec.

Uncanny dodge on 22nd lvl in a dex build? That's not gonna make your life easy at all. Damage output is low, saves are good, will apart (but you've got slippery mind) but you are forgetting to put ranks in spellcraft, your stealth skills (considering you are taking 19 lvls in SD) suck.<br>I'd move some SD preepic, taking monk on 7th lvl (and not on 1st) to qualify for SD asap or otherwise take more monk lvls (6 seems a nice investment KD/IKD, deflect arrows, still mind, purity of body, monk's endurance for 120% speed, more damage with fists) and some FTR in epic to grab, f.e., armor skin and maybe epic will. With no improved stunning fist, your SF DC is kinda low (30) and you've got only 4 uses/day AFAIK  since you took 1 lvl monk+extra stun.fist so maybe you'd better be off forgetting about it and free up a feat preepic.<br>Maybe something like Monk 6/FTR 18/SD 16 is gonna be better balanced or just forget monk and build something like FTR 20(16)/Rogue 19/ SD 1(5) and take ISF in epic starting with 18 DEX and 16 WIS. You're better off starting with 18 dex, 16 wis also in this build of yours btw.<br>Also I seem to remember a recent build by the dwarflord...the shadowboxer maybe? <br>Oh, yeah, that's it <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "221720", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Shadowboxer</a><br>I hope I was helpful<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Getting SD earlier would ease things up but it would hurt BA. I really focused on the 7 attacks per round. Thinking of it though, 5 monk/sd and 15 fighter pre-epic should be enough. This is an interesting idea, I'll look into it.<br><br>Extra stunning attacks can be changed into anything you feel like, but as a low int warrior you got most usefull pre-epic feats already.<br><br>Lowering dex and getting more wis would be nice (as would more int), but self concealment requires 30 dex and I found it too hard to fit it if I stared with less dex.<br><br>Skills does indeed suck, but it's not really supposed to use the stealth skills much. Taking points from disciplin or listen to cross class some spellcraft should be worth it though.

I tried to build something with more monk and it was not bad but I soon realized that SD is not the way to go with such low damage output.
