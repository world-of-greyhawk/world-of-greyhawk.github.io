Thinking you messed up along the lines somewheres, I started this build, got to lvl 25, and noticed I only had 3 base attacks per round.  Ouch.  Too lazy to look more into it, just wanted to let you know.  (I followed the build sheet exactly, in case you think I tried to tweak it along the way)

This build does have 16 bab at level 20. Just tested it myself. <br><br>But what it doesn't get is improved knockdown. That would need an intelligence of 13, which this build doesn't have.

I'd consider dropping palemaster down from 18 to 16 levels. About the onyl epic spell worth while in NWN (outside of the PRC additions) is Epic Warding. Mage armor usually has abotu 3/4 if not all of its bonuses overwritten by item bonuses, and hell ball and greater ruin just don't seem to pack the punch they should.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>
