The character concept is really interesting, I like the idea of a charisma-heavy blackguard.  And you should be able to hit many enemies that are taunted and paralyzed by your rage, but I'd really suggest going to a two-hander or sword-and-board weapon configuration, and putting just a few more points towards AB would push you over the top so that paralysis-immune enemies don't hand you your butt on a platter.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

The idea was to make a build that had one stat modifying most things, CHA in this case modifying AC and damage with divine might and divine shield, saves with dark blessing and AB boost with taunt. Of course taunt doesnt really count as a strength based character can still have a good taunt.<br>I know dual-wielding may not be great in some environments and taking those out would mean adding toughness and IDK pre epic and freeing up two epic feats. Maybe better and more balanced. But I played this character through HotU, and now he is trying his hands on Infinite dungeons and sneak, divine damage and EWS really adds up when dual wielding.<br>But it is always a hard choice.

Perhaps a cha version of cinn's build with the same level split. Barb 16 ftr 2 BG 22. Focus in club and end up str 18 dex 12 con 14 wis 8 int 14 cha 24 could be a good middle ground.<br>Is it considered cheese to specialise in club?
