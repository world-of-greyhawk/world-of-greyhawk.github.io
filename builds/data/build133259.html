<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br>....<b>( Duel Shortsword )</b><br><br>Originally posted on June 4th 2004,<br><a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=348361&amp;forum=77&amp;sp=255" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br>11th post down<br><br>The fire danced in time to the music of the enchanted lute, but few of the merrymakers in the hall seemed to notice the pyrotechnics.  The exasperated bard, sought in vain to attract an audience but as he looked about the room he realized his efforts were in vain.  He was standing next to a large fire pit in the centre of the large hall; this pit provided both primary illumination and a means of cooking the food for the feast that was now being served.  As the bard played, he could see servants and slaves hurrying about with trays laden with food and amphorae full of wine and other drinks, carrying them to and from the raucous guests who were seated at the great slate tables that framed the inside of the room.  The bard finished his song and turned north of the room to salute his patron, King Lowfyr the Bold.  The tables at the north end of the room were made of wood and raised upon a dais; it was here that the king sat together with his family and advisors.  The tables to east and west were filled with the various guests of his majesty, some were low ranked nobles who wore the finest silk robes and most ornate garments, while others were knights and warriors clad in glittering mail and recently oiled leather armour.  None of these guests could match the finery of those at the royal table and they all paled in comparison to the king himself.   He was clad in shimmering mithril mail, with rings so fine it looked like cloth, the pauldrons and gorget were inlayed with a gold floral pattern that was continued in the elaborate bejewelled gold crown that sat upon his head, a fur trimmed royal blue velvet cloak completed the king’s ensemble.   He himself was a tall man, a bit over six feet, and well kept for man of fifty years.  He retained a musculature that spoke of one who was accustomed to carrying a sword.  His brown hair was streaked with silver and he wore a full beard that hid a leathery lined face that spoke of years spent campaigning against the barbarians in the North.  Despite his stern countenance, his gaze at once conveyed a sense of great wisdom and great compassion.  He raised his goblet to the bard and beckoned to him to continue.  As he did he looked to the southern end of the room and the only means of ingress into the hall, two heavyset iron studded oak doors, so large that two yoked oxen could be led side by side into the room.  As he stared at them lost in thought, the doors burst open and a throng of armed men burst into the room.<br><br>As quickly as they entered, the hall fell into silence except for the guards who rushed forth from hidden alcoves to protect the king.  The intruders walked forward followed by even more of the king’s men.  Lowfyr examined his new guests, there were eight of them, all but two of them wore coarse wolf-skin cloaks over heavy black chain mail and pot helms.  They had large wooden mantlets secured to their knees and shoulders so that it guarded their flank and back, while leaving both arms free to carry their heavy one-sided axes.  These men were the guards of the other two.  The taller of these Lowfyr recognized as Vidar, chieftain of the Kodiak clan.  Vidar was near seven feet in height, he wore ill-fitting full plate armour, likely looted from one of Lowfyr’s knights, that barely contained the muscular barbarian.  He had a large double bladed great axe across his back and wore several gold chains about his neck that signified his standing among the barbarian clans of the north.  His long blond hair flowed wildly about head and did little to improve his brutish scarred appearance.  Lowfyr had always suspected the man had some orcish blood, though Vidar fiercely denied those accusations. Despite Vidar’s brutish appearance, Lowfyr knew him to be a wise and insightful man who was quite willing to compromise.  Lowfyr looked to Vidar’s companion, a short tattoo covered man wearing a loose fitting buck skin robe, that was covered in arcane symbols and decorated with talismans.  The man carried a feather capped wooden staff and had a bald tattooed head and face.  This was Hargluk’s chief advisor and shaman Hargluk.  While Vidar was the leader of his clan, Hargluk was the clan’s spritual leader and held as much power as Vidar himself.  Hargluk was a petty, ambitious man with no foresight and too much power.  While Vidar had fought for peace between the kingdom of Lowfyr and his clan, Hargluk had pushed for war.  Hargluk’s presence here did not bode well.  <br><br>Lowfyr waited until his guards were in place and then spoke,<br>“Vidar, what brings you to my hall this night?  Please, come, have a drink.  Enjoy my hospitality.”<br>The barbarians were always easier to deal with when inebriated, he thought.  Hargluk nudged Vidar, and the latter stepped forward speaking in a loud forceful voice,<br>“Lowfyr, you have angered our gods and we demand compensation.  You hosted a great hunt, nay slaughter, of the mighty Kodiak bear a mere two nights ago.  The bear is an animal sacred to our tribe, and our gods cry out for vengeance.  However, we will be satisfied with land that stretches from the hart wood to the rolling thunder river.”<br> The hall broke into laughter, that was a good five hundred acres of prime farmland, Lowfyr would never cede it.  Lowfyr raised his hand and the hall grew silent again.<br>“Vidar, we have a treaty that has brought peace and prosperity to our realms.  You would throw this away over a, triffle, such as this.  You know I cannot, will not, cede that land but by force.  The last time we fought, things went worse for you than they did for me.  Would you see your clan destroyed?  I will give you a thousand pieces of gold, surely this will satisfy your gods.” <br> Vidar seemed to backdown, but Hargluk stepped forward.<br>“The gods have spoken to me.  They say that the defilers must not hold this land, we must have the land or we must have blood.”<br>Hargluk gave Vidar a hard stare, and Vidar spoke again.<br>“I would not see us throw away what we have fought so hard for, but if we cannot have land there must be war.”<br>Lowfyr considered the situation, he knew that if he could give Vidar an option, the latter would take it to maintain the treaty.  Lowfyr looked to his right and the man sitting next to his son. The man was in the height of his power, perhaps in early thirties or late twenties.  He was wearing a gold and silver brocade overcoat, and had his long black hair tied back in a neat pony tail.  He had strong aquiline features and was nearly as tall as Vidar, though he had the svelte build of long distance runner as opposed to the robust build of a warrior.  The man was one of the few still sober revellers and he regarded Lowfyr with intelligent gaze that served as a tacit acknowledgment of his King’s request.  Lowfyr, looked to Vidar and spoke,<br>“Perhaps we can forgo the need for war.  I will put forward a champion, and you will do the same.  The two of them shall fight and to the winner will go the spoils.”<br>Lowfyr, could see the insipid grin fall from the face of Hargluk as he spoke.  Vidar moved forward to speak,<br>“I accept your terms…” before he could continue, Hargluk interjected, “Yes, your terms are satisfactory, but we will not a assign a champion like a weak old women.  Vidar will fight for our clan.”<br>Lowfyr could see the gleam in Hargluk’s eyes.  If Vidar won, the Kodiak clan would take the land, and if Vidar lost, Hargluk would find a replacement that would be more amenable to his wishes.  Lowfyr had no choice but to acquiesce, Hargluk would win this day and he had at best bought a short reprieve from war.  Vidar’s shoulders fell, he turned and regarded Hargluk with a gaze of pure contempt.  Then he unshouldered his great axe and spoke.<br>“I am ready, call forth your champion.”<br><br>Vidar was surprised when the man in the overcoat rose from his seat, he had assumed this man was a cousin of the King or a friend to his son not a warrior who would fight a duel with so much at stake. He thought, perhaps Lowfyr intended to cede the land and needed the duel to save face.  Lowfyr’s men knew better, this young man was the Ferromancer, one of the best duellists in the realm. The young man removed his overcoat, he was wearing a loose fitting black silk shirt and leather pants.  Hanging from his belt, one on either side of his body, were two shortswords in gilded scabbards. There were several red ribbons hanging from the wrists and elbows of the shirt that he tied around his arms as he headed for the south end of the room.  The servants busied themselves clearing the centre of the hall and preparing it for the duel.  The Ferromancer reached the southern end of the room and he paused to tie the scabbards down to his thighs.  <br><br>As he waited for the room to clear, the Ferromancer considered his opponent more carefully.  The Kodiak clan was a meritocracy of sorts, the strongest warriors held the highest positions, hence Vidar could prove challenging.  Vidar was definitely stronger than the Ferromancer, hence the Ferromancer would have to rely on speed.  Vidar had a solid stance and wore heavy armour; hence he would not be able to turn quickly.  Vidar was taking a few practice swings with his axe.  The Ferromancer had to admit he had excellent form, and the axe itself was magnificent.  There were many who felt the Kodiak were backward, but he knew better, their metalworking was excellent and this axe was a testament to their artifice.  The blade was broad and well curved so that it wouldn’t stick, and it was covered in barbarian runes of power.  The Ferromancer did not need his arcane training to sense the power of the enchantments on the weapon.  The haft was made of ironwood, studded with nails in such a way that it strengthened it against breaking.  The handle was carefully wrapped in leather to enhance its wielders grip.  Vidar would be difficult to duel indeed, in particular as he did not want kill this man.  If he killed him, he knew Hargluk would take control of the Kodiak.  Perhaps if he wounded Vidar badly enough the latter would concede the duel and retain his rank.  The Ferromancer stretched his limbs and drew his swords.<br><br>Vidar looked at the Ferromancer, this was an odd warrior.  He did not wear armour and he carried light blades.  However, Vidar had heard of battles his clan had had with elves in the past and he knew that they often did not use armour and they were formidable warriors.  The Ferromancer stepped lightly and had an undeniable grace about him, Vidar guessed his opponent would try to flank him.  Vidar considered his opponents blades.  They were too light to be steel, he guessed that they were made of mithril and he could see smooth writing on the blades, which he assumed meant that they were magical.  The hilt had a simple cross guard made of a mithril plate and the grip and pommel were made of brass, which was bound with black leather.  He guessed that the swords were likely balanced near the hilt; hence they could be wielded quickly, though they would not cut deep.  He doubted they could pierce his armour.  Even if they did, Vidar was more than he appeared.<br><br>The servants cleared the centre of the room, and the two warriors took their positions on either side of the fire pit.  The Ferromancer stood at the north end, and Vidar stood at the south.  The Ferromancer looked through the fire to his opponent, as he did he mused about how similar this was to his first back alley duels.  He was born to a simple family of peasants; his life was simple but good until the war with the Kodiak.  His father enlisted with the hopes of earning some extra gold for his family but he never returned.  Soon after the news of his death reached the family, the Ferromancer’s mother hung herself.  At the age of 10 the Ferromancer, his older brother and his younger sister were forced to fend for themselves.  For a while he and his brother supported themselves as thieves, well his brother was a thief and he was the lookout.  They managed to survive until his brother was caught by the town guard and executed, then the he was forced to find another means of survival.  The Thieves’ Guild ran illegal duels in the back alleys of the city for the purposes of gaming.  They pitted the poor and wretched against each other or feral dogs for a few pieces of gold, and it was here the Ferromancer learned to fight.  As Lowfyr announced the commencement of the duel, he broke from his reverie and concentrated on the task at hand.<br><br>The two combatants circled the fire pit, glaring at each other through the flames.  Vidar backed up and called to his opponent, “Stop hiding like a child, I will make your death quick and painless.”  The Ferromancer saluted Vidar, and slowly circled to the left until he was in line with the mighty barbarian.  Vidar edged to his right, trying to place his opponent between him and the fire.  The Ferromancer saw through this obvious tactic, with an opponent as strong as Vidar he needed room to manoeuvre.  The Ferromancer rushed in with a flurry of quick strikes to his opponent’s body. Vidar blocked them easily with his axe and bracers, but the Ferromancer hadn’t expected to wound his opponent.  The flurry had prevented Vidar from attacking and let him pivot about his opponent, getting away from the fire.  The two combatants regarded each other again.  The Ferromancer chided his opponent, “You shall require more speed than that if you wish to trap me.”  Vidar, feigning rage, rushed towards the Ferromancer, then stopped short of his opponent’s reach and swung out from left to right with his greataxe.  The Ferromancer pulled himself out of the weapon’s range and hooked the axe blade with his left sword as he stepped in against Vidar’s body.  As Vidar began his counter swing, the Ferromancer thrust with his right sword at Vidar’s face and using the momentum from Vidar’s swing he threw himself into a shoulder roll coming up on his feet outside of the Barbarian’s range.  Vidar wiped the blood from cut the Ferromancer had opened under his left eye and glared at his opponent.  <br><br>The Ferromancer quipped, “I think my cut has greatly improved your appearance.”  Enraged, Vidar threw himself at his opponent madly swinging his axe.  The Ferromancer retreated, due to his opponent’s great strength, he was forced to use both his swords to parry the great axe.  While Vidar was enraged, he did not overbalance, a barbarian knew rage could be ally.  Vidar made a high swing at his opponent and the Ferromancer saw his chance.  He ducked under Vidar’s swing and thrust with both swords at the Barbarian’s groin.  Vidar jerked his body back, as he did the Ferromancer knocked his legs out from under him with a sweeping kick.  As Vidar struggled to regain his feet, the Ferromancer rushed in and thrust his right blade into the space between the greaves of Vidar’s armor inflicting a deep arterial wound.  The Ferromancer spun away from his opponent, leaving Vidar on the ground.<br><br>He assumed that Vidar would yield the duel.  He did not know many men who would continue fighting with that kind of wound, well there had been one, another barbarian in fact.  The Ferromancer had been duelling for several years and had risen in the ranks; he was no longer fighting in black alleys.  Instead he fought in the guild’s private arena.  He was admitted into the thieves’ guild, where he became the Guildmaster’s personal duellist.  He had been called to fight an outcast barbarian of the Kodiak clan that had become an enforcer for the guild.  This barbarian had been foolish enough to plot a coup against Guildmaster.  Captured before he could act, an example was to be made of him.  It was the first time the Ferromancer had fought against a berserker.   After the Ferromancer disabled one of his opponents arms, collapsed a lung and slashed his throat, the Barbarian still fought until he bled to death.  The Ferromancer turned his gaze back towards Vidar, the flow of blood from the wound had all but ceased and he was rising to his feet.  Perhaps, thought the Ferromancer, he had missed the artery completely.  Still there was quite a bit of blood on the stone floor.  Vidar tightened his grip on the weapon and grinned, “This battle is far from over, scarecrow”<br><br>With his wound, Vidar could not put as much force behind his swings but he was still far stronger than his opponent.  He had to be careful, as the Ferromancer had used even the smallest lapse in his defence to strike him.  For his part, the Ferromancer decided to take the offence.  He rushed towards Vidar and threw a combination of slashes at the barbarian, which the latter easily blocked.  Instead of retreating, he held his ground and began circling to his right, forcing Vidar to turn on his wounded leg. Vidar, grimaced as he fought to keep up with his nimble opponent, he couldn’t match speed with the Ferromancer much longer.  He made a heavy swing at his opponent, rushing forward to pass the Ferromancer and open some distance.  The Ferromancer barely avoided the attack with a forward roll.  He turned to face his opponent again and saw Vidar turning to come at him with another charge; it appeared his wound had not been deep at all.  As Vidar rushed towards him, the Ferromancer charged as well.  As they neared, the Ferromancer veered slightly to the right, causing Vidar to commit to a heavy left to right swing to prevent from being flanked.  As the axe began to move, the Ferromancer dropped to the ground and rolled into his oppenent’s legs.  As Vidar fell to the ground, the Ferromancer pulled his legs under him and pounced on the prostrate barbarian.  Before his opponent could react, the Ferromancer buried his left sword in Vidar’s armpit, bypassing his armour, and rolled away coming to his feet.  The sword had sunk deep, piercing the lung and Vidar flailed onto his back struggling for air and coughing blood.  As Vidar turned over, the Ferromancer moved in.  With one fluid motion, he hooked Vidar’s axe with his right sword and struck his wrist with his left sword, sending the mighty weapon flying into the air.  As Ferromancer retreated, he thought to himself, with a wound like that Vidar would not be able to continue and a cleric should still be able to save him.<br><br>A look of horror passed over the Ferromancer’s face, as he realized Vidar’s flailing was not due to pain.  The barbarian was clawing at his armor, and screaming in agony as his bones snapped, lengthened and reformed, his skin stretched and his muscles expanded.  Before his eyes, the Ferromancer saw tufts of fur spurt from his opponent’s skin.  When Vidar rose again, the Ferromancer was face to face with a werebear.  The Ferromancer ran from his opponent and skirted the firepit putting it between himself and his opponent.  The creature rushed towards him, stopping short of the fire and growled.  Its primal mind still feared fire.  As the creature growled at him from across the fire, the Ferromancer began an arcane chant.  At first he was barely aware of the flow of energy around him, but as the chant continued he could feel a swirling web of energy form between him and his opponents, with his word and thoughts he shaped it and then released it at his opponent.  A blast of green energy flew from his arms and swirled around the beast forming itself into a large green hand that tried to grasp and restrain the raging lycanthrope.  The creature raged against the spell, for the moment forgetting his adversary.  <br><br>While it was not an ability he typically made use of, the Ferromancer was an accomplished wizard.  During his tenure with the Thieves’ guild the Ferromancer had also served as an enforcer.  It was distasteful work, which he would have rather avoided, but when one had a sister and was wanted by the Guild, one worked for the Guild.  One of his jobs for the Guild involved visiting a wizard who had not placed the required number of charges on a wand he had been contracted to build by the Guildmaster.  He was young and inexperienced with dealing with wizards and was perhaps overzealous in his demands of the spell caster.  He drew his swords and threatened the mage, but no sooner than his blades had left their scabbards, the mage with a mere word left him paralysed.  As the mage advanced, he thought for sure that he was finished.  Fortunately for him, the Guildmaster had expected his rash behaviour and had sent an assassin to shadow him.  As the mage prepared to strike, a poisoned dart from the shadows silenced him for eternity.  Impressed by the power of the wizard, and unsure of his longevity within the Guild, the Ferromancer decided to emulate him.  When he saved enough gold, he sent his sister to Amn and entered into the Wizard’s academy.  While the academy protected him from retribution from the Guild, he had been foolish to assume that Amn was outside the Guildmaster’s reach.  The Ferromancer began to call upon the arcane energies again, this time to conceal himself.  As the spell began to form he felt the arcane energies being ripped away from him.  He spun to see Hargluk grinning at him.<br><br>The Ferromancer grinned back and rushed towards the shaman.  Until Hargluk had interfered, this was a duel between between Vidar and himself, but now the conniving shaman was fair game.  He saw Hargluk beginning to cast again and he recognized the spell as a common missile spell.  The Ferromancer spoke a few words calling upon his own arcane skills.  As the bolts of energy streaked towards him, the Ferromancer winced, but the protective shield he had erected absorbed them harmlessly.  As the Ferromancer closed, Grishnak decided to concentrate on defence casting a powerful defensive spell on himself and raising his staff.  However, Hargluk was no Vidar.  With a deft motion, the Ferromancer sent his staff flying from his hands.  Before Hargluk could react, the Ferromancer thrust his blades under his opponents arm, and with a twisting motion, he threw the shaman to the ground.  As Hargluk struggled to his feet, the Ferromancer used his own arcane abilities to strip the protective spell from his opponent.  As Hargluk started to cast another spell, the Ferromancer severed his neck with a scissor like strike from his two blades.  As the Ferromancer called another concealment spell upon himself, he thought about how much this had been like the duel that had earned him his name.<br><br>He had been at the academy for a few years, but it had not been easy.  His past soon came to light, and he was constantly taunted by the students and teachers for being too physical for a mage.  The worst of it came from an evoker and cousin of the mage he had unwittingly helped to assassinate.  He was an accomplished spell caster and the Ferromancer should have shown more restraint, but he challenged the evoker to a duel.  As the duel began, the evoker activated a spell sequencer raising several defensive spells including a damage shield spell.  The Ferromancer raised an elemental shield spell, but that was the last of the spells he cast.  The evoker threw a constant stream of lightning bolts and fireballs at the Ferromancer, which threw the latter into series rolls, flips and other acrobatic manoeuvres even he had doubted he could execute.  The Ferromancer wanted to fight like a mage, but he couldn’t the evoker was too strong.  As he rolled past a cone of cold, he realized he couldn’t keep his strength up much longer.  The evoker’s next spell was a magic missile.  As the bolts of energy ripped through his body he lurched towards his opponent dropping into a roll.  As he came out of his roll, he drew his shortswords, which he had hidden with an invisibility spell before the duel, and, still in a crouch, he swept his opponents feet out from under him with deft kick. He straddled the prostrate evoker and using all his body weight he plunged his weapons into his opponents heart.  He still remembered the pain he felt as his blades pierced the Evoker’s defences, the elemental defence spell he cast absorbed most of the energy from the Evoker’s fire shield spell, but he still suffered severe burns.  To make matters worse, he had broken the cardinal rule of mage duels, finishing his opponent with brute force rather than magic.  Before long every mage in the academy was mocked him with the moniker of wizard of steel, he knew he would have to leave.  However wizards were not the only spectators at the duel, King Lowfyr had watched the duel and knew of his past as a duellist.  The King hired him, giving him the rank of knight and the name of Ferromancer.<br><br>The duel was still not over, the Ferromancer had to defeat Vidar.  He advanced towards the beast, a few well-placed strikes, should cause enough damage to trigger another transformation.  Vidar had recovered from the shock of his spell, and smelt the air for his opponent.  The Ferromancer realized it would not take long for his opponent to find him.  He recalled how Vidar had reacted to fire; with a few arcane chants he caused his own blades to erupt into fire.  As Vidar rushed towards him, the Ferromancer manoeuvred back, putting the beast between him and fire pit.  As Vidar came into position, the Ferromancer rushed towards him.  The lycanthrope fought past the ethereal hand and levelled a mighty swing at his invisible opponent, but his claw was met by the Ferromancer’s sword. Vidar howled in pain as the magical fire burned his skin; even the Ferromancer was repulsed by the acrid smell of burning fur.  Still the Ferromancer pushed on with a flurry of light strokes to his opponents arm.  The wounded beast retreated, trying to save itself from burning blades.  As the Lycanthrope neared the fire pit, the Ferromancer redoubled his efforts, ducking under the beast’s awkward flails and thrusting his blades into its stomach.  The Beast howled and leapt back into the fire.<br><br>Ablaze, Vidar leapt forward out of the pit, and dropped to the ground roaring in pain.  Heavy black smoke rose from the beasts burning fur as its flesh blistered and burned.  The Ferromancer, retreated his own hands ached with phantom pain from his memories of his encounter with the evoker.  As Vidar spasmed in pain, he watched as the reverse transformation began.  The Ferromancer called the guards to throw water on his opponent.  As the fire subsided, the Ferromancer approached the prostrate battered form of the barbarian chieftain.  He touched the barbarian’s neck, Vidar recoiled somewhat showing he was still semi-conscious.  The Ferromancer leaned in and spoke,  “You fought valiantly, but you’ve been defeated.  Hargluk is dead, there is no need for you to die as well.  It would only bring an end to all you fought for.  Surrender now and the clerics can still save you.”  With a voice no more than a hoarse whisper, Vidar yielded.<br><br>The ferromancer stepped back and let the clerics get to work.  He looked around the hall, the floor was streaked with blood from Vidar and Hargluk and the audience was cheering his name.  It was an odd effect, during the duel he had been focused on combat and had tuned out the rest of the hall, now it was like his other senses had been suddenly magnified.  He dispelled the enchantments he had cast on himself and his weapons and handed his swords to one of the King’s servants to be cleaned.  The Ferromancer then went to speak with his King.  With his victory the land would remain within his realm.  Vidar though severely wounded would recover, and with Hargluk dead, the treaty would be even stronger.  Lowfyr would have to pay a wergild to Hargluk’s family but it was a small price to pay.  As for the Ferromancer, he would be elevated to the title of baron and given some land, but he would still stay by his liege’s side ready to answer the next challenge that demanded blood.    <br><br><i>Advantages</i><br>-Epic Dodge.  He avoids the first attack each turn<br>-Level 5 Mage spells.  He can cast mage spells, to buffs himself, and inflict injury on his opponents<br>-Maxed out Use Magic Devices.  He can cast any spell from a scroll and use equipment for other classes.<br>-Improved Evasion.  Vs. spells his saves are pretty good, so he should be able to avoid most spell damage.  His will save is low so a will save boosting item is high on his list.<br>-14D6 Sneak Attack.  Coupled with darkness, invisibility spells and combat feats he should do major damage against opponents who are vulnerable to sneak attacks.<br>-Improved Knockdown and Disarm. This should help with sneak attacks and combat survivability.<br>-Good AC with just +5 items and attribute buffs.  He can raise that further by switching out a shortsword for a tower shield.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br>-Low Hitpoints.  He only has 320 hitpoints, with his other abilities he should do alright, but over 400 would be preferable.<br>-Low will save.<br>-Mediocre AB.
