Arcane Archer [Remember to put MAX points into Hide, Listen, Move Silently and Spot at this point]<br><br><br>Spells:<br><br>True Strike<br>Protection From Alignment<br>(feel free to choose the rest, only these two are "must have")<br><br>Ending Stats:<br>STR 14<br>DEX 34 (+10 from levels, + 7 from feats)<br>CON 12<br>INT 16<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 8<br><br>Total Skills:<br>Concentration 4<br>Disciline 35<br>Hide 43<br>Listen 43<br>Move Silently 43<br>Spot 43<br>Spellcraft 20<br>Tumble 35<br><br>Left over skill points to spend 23<br><br>Saving Throws:<br>Fortitude 24<br>Reflex 35<br>Will 20<br><br>Armor Class: 31<br><br>Attack Bonus:<br>Base 26<br>Longbow +56/+51/+46/+41<br>Unarmed +28/+25/+22/+19/+16/+13<br><br>Damage:<br>1-8 +15 (Critical 19-20 / x3)<br><br>Health Points:<br>Around 320-400 depending how many times you reroll your hit points during level up.<br><br>Strength:<br>1. Your attack bonus is so high you should hit anything you encounter, if not, use true strike. (with True Strike that's 76/71/66/61 for 3 rounds, two times per rest)<br><br>2. You can sneak as good as any Rogue ever could, you have the high DEX and Hide/MS maxed, you're pretty much invisible.<br><br>3. Those 10 monk levels gives you enough speed to out run melees, mages, rogues, barbarians, everyone except other monks. This speed you use whenever you need to retreat from combat.<br><br>4. Taking 30% concealment from epic feats gives good protection against melee and other archers.<br><br>Weakness:<br>1. Your AC is not that high, if you're caught in melee you will probably take severe punch, even though you have concealment. Try to avoid melee(that's what the monk levels are for).<br><br>2. Your damage is not that good so fights against opponents with huge hit points will take long time. Also piercing/physical damage resistance is quite impossible for you to handle if larger than 15.<br><br>Play style:<br>Always remain hidden, when you see opponent shoot him couple times, then run to nearest corner and hide again, shoot the opponent, run to corner, repeat.<br>If there's no corner around just run away, you'll gain some distance because you're faster than others(except monks), then take few shots at the opponent, repeat.<br>If there's arrows with elemental damage attributes available always use those, so you still do some damage to even those with physical damage resistance.<br>This character reaches it's peak in power at 24, after that playing should be quite easy against opponents of your level or a bit higher. At level 32, after last monk level, you're pretty much achieved everything, the last few levels are just minor adjustment.<br><br>Visualization:<br><a href="http://www.saunalahti.fi/%7Etuomosy/nwn/archer1.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.saunalahti.fi/~tuomosy/nwn/archer1.jpg</a><br><a href="http://www.saunalahti.fi/%7Etuomosy/nwn/archer2.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.saunalahti.fi/~tuomosy/nwn/archer2.jpg</a><br><a href="http://www.saunalahti.fi/%7Etuomosy/nwn/archer3.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.saunalahti.fi/~tuomosy/nwn/archer3.jpg</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 10/12/07 20:20</span></i></p>
