Hi All,<br><br>I have been trying to build a pure paladin, I have checked the search engine and found "GhostNWN" build, it is a str build but was looking more for a Smitter type. The server I run on "Neversummer 4" grants greater abilities to pure class types. Any assistance would be appreciated. <br><br>S.

One suggestion - if the server doesn't have perma-haste items, consider going with the Str-build. <br><br>While playing a monk build through a module, I picked up a Cha-based pally henchman. Most battle went something like this:<br><br>My character runs in and starts attacking (8 unarmed sttacks per round, str-based for high damage). <br>Henchie uses Divine Shield. <br>Henchie casts extended Divine Favor. <br>Henchie uses Divine Might. <br>Henchie casts Holy Sword. <br>Henchie runs over to help me pick up the loot from all the dead enemies.<br><br>If you are hasted, you can self-buff decently in 2 rounds. Unhasted, you will spend so much time buffing that either the battle will be won by your henchmen or party members before you join in, or you will get hammered by something before you are done buffing. And an unhasted Cha-based pally is fairly weak except for smites.<br><br>TM

Just went and looked at your server rules. I see that Aasimar is supported there, and what the pure Pally bonuses are (specifically, double duration on DM/DS, +1 to AB per 5 cha bonus on DM, HS bonus increases up to +10 by level 40, plus a few others).<br><br>Given those, I would modify the build as follows:<br><br>Paladin(40), Human (Aasimar)<br><br>STR: 13 (14)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 10<br>CHA: 19 (28)<br><br>Hitpoints: 480<br>Skillpoints: 129<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 33/27/24<br>Saving Throw bonuses: <br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 36 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 15/26<br>Discipline 43(45), Taunt 43(52), Tumble 20(19)<br><br>01: Paladin(1): Knockdown, Weapon Focus<br>02: Paladin(2): {Smite Evil}<br>03: Paladin(3): Power Attack<br>04: Paladin(4): CHA+1, (CHA=20)<br>05: Paladin(5)<br>06: Paladin(6): Divine Might<br>07: Paladin(7)<br>08: Paladin(8): CHA+1, (CHA=21)<br>09: Paladin(9): Divine Shield<br>10: Paladin(10)<br>11: Paladin(11)<br>12: Paladin(12): CHA+1, Extend Spell, (CHA=22)<br>13: Paladin(13)<br>14: Paladin(14)<br>15: Paladin(15): Blind Fight<br>16: Paladin(16): CHA+1, (CHA=23)<br>17: Paladin(17)<br>18: Paladin(18): Extra Smiting<br>19: Paladin(19)<br>20: Paladin(20): CHA+1, (CHA=24)<br>21: Paladin(21): Epic Weapon Focus<br>22: Paladin(22)<br>23: Paladin(23): Epic Prowess<br>24: Paladin(24): CHA+1, Great Smite I, (CHA=25)<br>25: Paladin(25)<br>26: Paladin(26): Great Smite II<br>27: Paladin(27): Great Smite III<br>28: Paladin(28): STR+1, (STR=14)<br>29: Paladin(29): Great Smite IV<br>30: Paladin(30): Great Smite V<br>31: Paladin(31)<br>32: Paladin(32): CHA+1, Great Smite VI, (CHA=26)<br>33: Paladin(33): Great Smite VII<br>34: Paladin(34)<br>35: Paladin(35): Great Smite VIII<br>36: Paladin(36): CHA+1, Great Smite IX, (CHA=27)<br>37: Paladin(37)<br>38: Paladin(38): Great Smite X<br>39: Paladin(39): Armor Skin<br>40: Paladin(40): CHA+1, (CHA=28)<br><br>You could drop a couple of Great Smites for more Great Cha if you want to hit Cha 30. I stopped at 28 because you can self-buff it by 9, needing only 3 from items to hit the cap, and with a 40 Cha you have +15 Cha bonus, giving you a nice +3 to AB from Epic DM. I don't think you can reach +20, so not much point in increasing it further.<br><br>AB is still sort of mediocre, and he's still very buff-dependent, but the buffs are quite good. Too bad there's no way to extend HS, but at least you get 40 rounds out of it, and 30 from DM/DS when fully buffed, so you can afford to "pre-buff" when you think a battle is coming instead of losing the first few rounds.<br><br>Note that the pure Fighter bonuses are even better than the pure Pally's on your server....<br><br>TM

Tattoed Monk, first off - thanks very much for the build, and yep you are correct the pure fighter is much better. I am also trying to build one on paper to see how it looks. I do not know how you do it but you guys make building them seem soo easy, so with that said if you have a pure fighter build also.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>Thanks again S.

Download the Character Build Creator. It's an excel spreadsheet with all of the class abilities, feats, etc., in it. You select abilities, classes, skills and feats, and it calculates AC, AB, saves, spellcasting, etc., and puts it into a nice output format (the builds I posted above are cut and paste directly from the Output sheet).<br><br>Search for CBC on the nwvault.ign.com, and download the latest version. It does not support subraces like Aasimar, but you can either add them yourself, or just add 2 to the relevant abilities.<br><br>TM

I'd be really tempted to do an Earth Genasi pure fighter build on that server. +7 natural AC plus nice DR from Earth Genasi (not to mention +2 to Str and Con), +5 to AB, AC and regen and an extra attack per round that stacks with Haste from pure fighter. Take WF/EWF/WS/EWS in 3 weapons - say Rapier (for piercing damage and high crit range), Katana or Bastard Sword (for slashing damage) and Heavy Flail (for blunt damage and a 2-handed option). Only take IC/OC/DC for the Rapier. Use the rapier for anything crit-susceptible, the katana for crit-immune and blunt resistant, and the flail for crit-immune and slash resitant or high-DR. For feats, take KD/IKD, Disarm/Imp Disarm, PA/Cleave/Gr. Cleave, Epic Prowess and Armor Skin, and use all of the general epic feats for Gr. Str. You could get Str up to 36. <br><br>You could pick different weapons, just be sure to have all 3 damage types available and 1 with high crit range for Dev Crit. You should get your AB into the 50's, and have plenty of damage output. AC is pretty good despite cross-classing Tumble thanks to the Earth Genasi bonus and the +5 pure fighter bonus.<br><br>TM

I skipped the ITWF option since Earth Genasi have a -2 Dex penalty which makes it difficult to get, and being Str-based he gets a nice damage bonus from going 2-handed without losing any AB. You could also skip WS/EWS on the rapier since it gets Dev Crit. And you could obviously take the WF/WS/EWF/EWS in whatever order you wanted. I set it up to get Dev Crit on the Rapier ASAP, but the order isn't important otherwise.<br><br>Lots of flexibility with all those feats.

When a weapon has 2 damage types, it is resisted by both resistance types (in other words, the halberd is resisted by both 50% slashing resistance and 50% piercing resistance). You want a weapon that does each type alone, so you can use it on things resistant to the ones it DOESN'T do. Also, there is no point to putting Dev Crit on the 2-handed weapon - you want to use Dev Crit on crit-susceptible enemies, who will die from the crit  long before they die from the extra damage.

Yes, we really do need some builds that take into account the changes of 1.69. Halberd wielders, PDKs. Oh, and all those 16 druid lvl dragons can go poof now.

Not much else to take but Epic Toughness.<br><br>I didn't realize they had fixed dual-damage in 1.69. In that case, you could go with Halberd for your 2-hander if you want.<br><br>If you drop to 2 weapons, you open up some pre-epic feats for save boosters. In epic, though, you are using all of the general feats for Great Str, so freeing up feats doesn't help that much. About the only new things you can take are more Epic Toughness or Superior Initiative (if you add Imp Initiative pre-epic), unless you drop 2 Great Str.<br><br>TM
