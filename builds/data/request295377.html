Ah yeah, getting knocked around all the time gets old pretty quick, doesn't it?  Could use a little more info about your server before tossing around suggestions.<br><br>What kind of ability score boosting equipment does it have?  Is it easy or hard to get the max of +12 to your stats on your gear?  Or, do you have to rely on spells like Bulls Strength and such to buff your stats?<br><br>Are there any feats, like Devastating Critical or Epic Dodge, that are banned?<br><br>Are there any classes banned?<br><br>The sneakers you're talking about, they're shadowdancers, right?  Corner sneakers?  True Seeing is availble?  <br><br>Any other major changes, like nerfing Divine Power, or Time Stop, or other spells and abilities?<br><br>Give us some more info, and I'm sure we can help you out.

If sneaks are always getting you maybe find a way to work 10 pale master levels in? That way you'll be immune to sneak attack and critical hits. Maybe a Bard/Assassin/Pale Master would work?

Druid Elemental shape or Shifter Construct Shape are 2 other methods to be Crit and Sneak immune.<br><br>You could make a nice Druid Monk Assassin build, or Druid Shifter Rogue/Assassin.<br><br>I suggest assassin since you can dump heavy points into INT in order to boost your Death Attack DC and not affect your STR and DEX (since that comes with most forms).

How about this build? It's a variation on one I made before, this time concentrating more on being harder to sneak up on and knock down, although not immune to either. Don't forget the True Seeing spell. The Concentration skill comes late and only reaches 20, so try to buff <i>before</i> combat, and use potions for healing during combat.<br><br><b>Watchful Combat Cleric (Cleric 26 / Fighter 4 / Champion of Torm 10)</b><br>Human, Any Non-Evil<br>PvM or PvP, Playable 1 - 40<br><br><i>Abilities:</i><br>STR: 16 (30)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 16 (20)<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br><i>Leveling Guide:</i><br>Human: (Quick to Master)<br>01: Cleric(1): Blind Fight, Power Attack, Domain Magic, Domain Trickery<br>02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Warhammer<br>03: Cleric(2): Extend Spell<br>04: Cleric(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>05: Cleric(4)<br>06: Cleric(5): Cleave<br>07: Cleric(6)<br>08: Cleric(7): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>09: Cleric(8): Alertness<br>10: Cleric(9)<br>11: Cleric(10)<br>12: Cleric(11): WIS+1, Skill Focus: Listen, (WIS=17)<br>13: Fighter(2): Improved Critical: Warhammer<br>14: Cleric(12)<br>15: Cleric(13): Empower Spell<br>16: Cleric(14): WIS+1, (WIS=18)<br>17: Cleric(15)<br>18: Cleric(16): Great Cleave<br>19: Champion of Torm(1)<br>20: Cleric(17): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br>21: Fighter(3): Great Strength I, (STR=19)<br>22: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Warhammer<br>23: Champion of Torm(2): Epic Weapon Focus: Warhammer<br>24: Champion of Torm(3): STR+1, Great Strength II, {Smite Evil}, (STR=21)<br>25: Champion of Torm(4): Epic Weapon Specialization: Warhammer<br>26: Cleric(18)<br>27: Champion of Torm(5): Great Strength III, (STR=22)<br>28: Champion of Torm(6): STR+1, Overwhelming Critical: Warhammer, (STR=23)<br>29: Champion of Torm(7)<br>30: Champion of Torm(8): Great Strength IV, Epic Prowess, (STR=24)<br>31: Champion of Torm(9)<br>32: Champion of Torm(10): STR+1, Devastating Critical: Warhammer, (STR=25)<br>33: Cleric(19): Great Strength V, (STR=26)<br>34: Cleric(20)<br>35: Cleric(21)<br>36: Cleric(22): STR+1, Great Strength VI, (STR=28)<br>37: Cleric(23): Armor Skin<br>38: Cleric(24)<br>39: Cleric(25): Great Strength VII, (STR=29)<br>40: Cleric(26): STR+1, Great Wisdom I, (STR=30), (WIS=20)<br><br><i>Stats:</i><br>Hitpoints: 388<br>Skillpoints: 215<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 31/30/21<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9<br>BAB: 25<br>AB (max, naked): 39 (melee), 25 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 15/26<br>Spell Casting: Cleric(9)<br>Alignment Changes: 0<br><br>(i)Skills:[/]<br>Concentration 20(21), Discipline 35(45), Listen 21(31), Spellcraft 43(45), Spot 35(42), Tumble 20(19)<br><br>01: Concentration(1), Listen(2), Spellcraft(4), Tumble(2), Save(7)<br>02: Discipline(5), Save(7)<br>03: Listen(1), Spellcraft(2), Tumble(1), Save(6)<br>04: Spellcraft(1), Save(10)<br>05: Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(10)<br>06: Spellcraft(1), Save(14)<br>07: Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(14)<br>08: Spellcraft(1), Save(18)<br>09: Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(18)<br>10: Spellcraft(1), Save(22)<br>11: Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(22)<br>12: Spellcraft(1), Save(26)<br>13: Discipline(11), Listen(1), Tumble(1), Save(16)<br>14: Spellcraft(2), Save(19)<br>15: Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(19)<br>16: Spellcraft(1), Save(23)<br>17: Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(23)<br>18: Spellcraft(1), Save(27)<br>19: Discipline(6), Listen(1), Spot(22), Tumble(1)<br>20: Spellcraft(2), Save(3)<br>21: Discipline(2), Listen(1), Tumble(1), Save(2)<br>22: Discipline(1), Save(6)<br>23: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spot(4), Tumble(1), Save(2)<br>24: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(5)<br>25: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), Save(4)<br>26: Spellcraft(6), Save(3)<br>27: Discipline(2), Listen(1), Spot(2), Tumble(1)<br>28: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(3)<br>29: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), Save(2)<br>30: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(5)<br>31: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), Save(4)<br>32: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(7)<br>33: Concentration(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(7), Tumble(1)<br>34: Concentration(4), Spellcraft(1)<br>35: Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1)<br>36: Concentration(4), Spellcraft(1)<br>37: Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1)<br>38: Concentration(4), Spellcraft(1)<br>39: Concentration(2), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1)<br>40: Concentration(4), Spellcraft(1)<br>_________________<br>Great Research Tools:<br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWNWiki</a><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">NWN Epic Character Build Search Engine</a><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/" target="_blank">The NWN Vault</a>

STR-based Bard/RDD/PM. Something like Bard 20/RDD 10/PM 10 or Bard 16/RDD 8/PM 10. You'll probably still have an issue hitting them, but they're not going to be able to do much to you (Sky high AC and immunity to crits/sneaks. As well, if you go with the 16 PM levels, you can grab a couple epic spells. Epic Warding and Epic Mage armor will put a damper on them).<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

@ Empyre65 -  Not to offend you or anything, but you lose 4 AC by not having a class with Tumble as a primary skill.  Also, why put ranks into listen at all when you have 26 caster levels and True Seeing?<br><br>@skydemonp38 - Empyre65 is on the right track in suggesting a high cleric level combat-based build.  I really can't stand Palemaster Clerics, personally, but given that mages and sneakers seem to be your biggest problem, a str-based 26 4 10 (or 20 4 16 if you want Epic Mage Armor, and don't mind having your buffs dispelled all the time) Cleric Bard Palemaster with rapier or scimitar and Devastating Critical might do the trick for you.  You'd be immune to sneaks, you'd have Str and Discipline to avoid being knocked down, sneakers generally have low Fort and are therefore fodder for Dev, Divine Shield, Cleric buffs and healing spells, Use Magic Device for scrolls, Curse Song so you can self-curse to be temporarily immune to other Bard's Curse Songs, and maybe even Taunt if you go human with a high Int score.

The more diverse skillset you inherit when you add rogue into the mix is a thing of beauty.  With so many Cleric levels, he might just need the Rogue levels to get a decent amount of skill points, too.  Plus, if his server has something like Improved Invisibility scrolls readily available, he could forego Trickery Domain for something like War or Healing, both of which can be extremely useful in PvP.
