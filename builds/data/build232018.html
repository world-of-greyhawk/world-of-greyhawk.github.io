<b>Raging, buffing and hacking a steady path 1-40, PvM. Would not be PvP specific, but he has Harm.</b><br><br><i>"Get lost, loser! This land is mine. I don't care if you claim to be a chosen of Thor. You were missing, and thus your land befell to me!"</i> Einar had a slick smile, mocking his one-time rival. Magnar was furious. He had been on a voyage and was thrown overboard in a storm. In some way he had drifted ashore, but had taken awhile to get back home. Arriving there his land had befallen his cousin, as he was the closest relative. Thus was the law of the land, but usually it was given back if the original owner for some reason showed up. But Magnar understood that Einar was sticking to his claim, with no intention of giving it back. <i>"Give up your claim, greedy bastard, or I will take it back somehow more painful.</i> Magnar stated through gritted teeth. His vision was blurred from his anger. Einar laughed mockingly. <i>"Oh would you now? Well then, what are you waiting for Magnar Landless?"</i> Einar had all his men around, counting about two dozen. He was also quite confident he alone was just as strong a warrior as Magnar. Adding to that, Magnar was wearing no armour or shield at the moment, the only thing he had was his heavy hammer of war.<br><br>Magnar was unable to reply, he had enough trouble restraining his fury. He held the hammer so hard his knuckles were white. They almost made a moaning noise from the strain his muscles put on them. All Magnar wanted to do was to smash that self-righteous niding's head in, but he knew he was at bad odds and had to pick another battleground to settle this. Einar had other plans, however. He seized the golden opportunity he had. <i>"There's another thing I must tell you, beloved cousin."</i> he said. Magnar stared him in the eyes, but still didn't reply. <i>"Your once beloved Sifa is now bethrothed to me. We will marry come sommer solstice. You are not invited."</i> He lied, Sifa had turned him down. But Magnar couldn't know that, and Einar knew he would lift his hammer, giving him an excuse to finish his life for good.<br><br>It was more than Magnar could take. He welcomed the red-hot fire inside and let it loose. He had nothing to live for anyhow. His grip on the hammer tightened even more and he roared out in fury, going completely berserk. His muscles were tightened and rock-hard, his fury feeding them power. The sky seemed to grow darker above him, and clouds were thickening. His rage was so unnerving that none of Einar's men seemed able to even react to the threat, but merely stood there, fear-stricken. Einar braced for the impact, and readied his sword to deliver the death blow. He was unnerved by Magnar's display of fury himself, but was still confident he would soon defeat him.<br><br>Magnar charged upon his adversary, roaring<i>"THOR, LET ME DIE WITH MY HAMMER IN MY HAND!"</i> He swung his hammer with all of his might, but Einar held his shield close and managed to catch the impact on it. He slashed quickly with his sword and caught the open Magnar in the ribs, sending a spray of blood to ground. The wound would have sent most men to their knees, even ended the battle. Magnar didn't even notice. The backswing of the hammer caught the shield again. The blow was so hard a crack appeared down the length of the shield. A jolt of lightning came from the hammer upon this impact, numbing Einar somewhat. Magnar didn't give Einar enough time to strike again, but immediately followed up with another mighty strike shattering the shield into hundreds of pieces and sending lightning into Einars body. The sky was black, and heavy rain was suddenly pouring down. Lightning and thunder cracked the sky, as if joining in Magnar's berserker rage. Magnar held his hammer above his head in both hands, and swung downwards with all the might he could muster. The blow hit the shoulder of his rival, crushing it completely and even caving in his chest. Einar was dead. Magnar calmed down, and the heavy clouds withdrew. All around Einars men had either laid down arms, fled or been struck by lightning. Magnar looked up at the retreating clouds and thought he saw a man in a carriage drawn by two goats disappear into the rainbow. From that day on his name was Magnar Stormfury. He was the champion of Thor, and his hammer the champion of Mjølner.<br>________<br><br>First of all, credits must be given where credits are due.

At last, its finished!<br><br>Nicely done Grimnir. Couple of things really. <br><br>AoV gives +4 to DEX, so why not start DEX at 8? You could pump starting WIS to 15 , which would let you free up a feat, perhaps at 39th. Or earlier, with a little rearranging.<br><br>Alternatively you could drop 2 Fighter levels in epic for 2 more of Cleric and drop Epic Prowess (this can be covered from your spell casting ability relatively well). This wsould increase your Spell Penetration by 2 points, giving you access to level 9 spells and increasing the total quantity of spells available to you overall. Possibly dropping ESF: Taunt at 27th would allow you to take another Great WIS to get an even finish, 1 point to Will and a further couple of spells, 1st and Fifth I think. <br><br>I've never been a fan of taking Skill Focus feats pre-epic, particularly when there are others that could help you more. After all, you have Eagle's Splendour to cast, which would boost your Intimidate Check by a minimum of 1 point anyway. Perhaps Spell Focus: Evocation to increase the likelihood of damage from your Lightning casts.<br><br>Just thoughts really, and kudos to you for the unique concept and class mix <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

"Black Clouds On The Horizon<br>Great Thunder And Burning Rain<br>His Chariot Pounding<br>I Heard The Heavens Scream His Name..."<br><br>I was waiting for the come of the Chosen of Thor with great anticipation and I must confess I am impressed.

Only thing I could change, and I bet you have that variant on your hard disk, is 2 more cleric lvls for 9th lvls spell and the very fitting, concept wise, storm of vengeance.

I am not certain if Spell Focus is any more useful than Skill Focus for this build. Each for his own, of course.<br><br>You're wrong about spells paying for the loss of Epic Prowess, because Epic Prowess raises your max AB by one. It's currently 66; without EP, it would be 65 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  Besides, 40 unbuffed AB looks better than 39 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"><br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm
