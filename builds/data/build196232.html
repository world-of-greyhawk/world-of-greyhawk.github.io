<b>Playable from 1-40.  PvP or PvM</b><br><br><b>Brood of the Mountains....Ranger28/Bard2/Rdd10 (revised)</b><br><br>Thirty years ago, a small group of Dwarven Priests were investigating the appearance of a new Dragon in a nearby mountain range. What they discovered in an isolated pass was the shattered remnants of a large caravan bound for Scornubel . It had been laden with treasure and artifacts, and was heavily guarded. Corpses were strewn about like ragdolls, wagons were charred by a mighty fire, and once proud knights were found with their very armour melted into their boiled flesh. There was no mistaking what happened here. The Priests heard a sobbing coming from a crevasse located several hundred feet away. There they found a human woman, naked, torn and shattered-- but alive. They took her in, and allowed her to recuperate in their Halls in the mountains. She recovered but was severely traumatized, and she had lost the capacity to speak. Approximately 9 months later, she gave birth to a child, but had died in labour so great was the ordeal. The Dwarves took the child and raised it as their own. But right away they knew this was no ordinary child.<br><br>And so the child grew among the Dwarves, and was reared by them, and became one of them, in both custom, thought and language, and he loved them as his parents, and they loved him as their own blood son. He spent more time roaming above the Mounatins than below, and became friendly with the animals that dwelt there. As he aged and grew into manhood, he asked the Dwarf Priests of his heritage. They explained that his Mother was a great woman, but they grew dark when questioned about his Father. They suspected, but they would not speak of it, not openly. But they taught him much. They skilled him in the Axe, and in war, and they skilled him in the mysteries of reducing and absorbing damage, and they taught him the weaknesses of otherwordly creatures.<br><br>And so it came to be, 20 years later, that this young man was hunting in the Mountain wilderness when he heard the sound of a hundred thunderclaps. Clambering to a spot of high ground, he could see a great winged form assailing the Door to the Halls of his Priest Fathers. Great gouts of fire spewed from the creature's mouth, and he could hear the agonizing cries of those who felt the fire. Mad with fear and panic, he raced up the mountain, across the rocks and ravines, and bounded up the slopes, like a panther, possessed, until he came before the wrecked gates and the burning bodies. There were none left alive. He found his foster father, burnt and twisted, and he held him for many long hours. And it was then that he heard the low rumbling laughter, like boulders scraping together, and a great shadow fell upon him and he felt a dread seep into his heart.<br>   "My son."<br>    He turned slowly to face the great Wyrm, but when he turned, there was only the wind howling among the rocks. <br>________<br><br>Spawned by Dragons, raised by Dwarves, The Brood of the Mountains is a deadly opponent no matter who he faces. <br><br>Human<br>Alignment: Any non-lawful<br><br><br>Naked AB w/mundane Great Axe: +44/39/34/29<br>Naked AB vs Favored Enemies:  +47/42/37/32<br>Dualwield AB w/normal handaxe :+42/37/32/27/42/37<br>Ac w/Studded Leather: 29<br><br>Saves: ( )indicate Spellcraft bonus <br>Fort: 26 (34)<br>Will: 25 (33)<br>Reflex: 22 (30)<br><br>Base max Hit Points: 498<br><br>Skills:<br>UMD: 42<br>Tumble: 42<br>Spellcraft: 43 (45)<br>Discipline: 43 (56)<br>Hide: 35<br>Move Silently: 35<br><br>Str15(36)<br>Int12(14)<br>Con14(16)<br>Wis14<br>Dex14<br>Chr8(10)<br><br>1 Ranger, Knockdown, WF: Great Axe, FE: Dragons<br>2 Ranger<br>3 Ranger, Power Attack<br>4 Ranger, Str16<br>5 Ranger, FE: Elves<br>6 Ranger, Cleave<br>7 Ranger<br>8 Ranger, Str17<br>9 Ranger, Great Cleave<br>10 Ranger, FE: Undead<br>11 Ranger<br>12 Ranger, Improved Crit, Str 18<br>13 Ranger<br>14 Ranger<br>15 Ranger, Lightning Reflexes*, FE: Elementals<br>16 Bard, Str 19<br>17 Rdd<br>18 Rdd, Str 21, Iron Will<br>19 Rdd<br>20 Rdd, Str 24<br>21 Rdd, Overwhelm Crit: Great Axe<br>22 Rdd<br>23 Rdd<br>24 Rdd, Str 25, Dev Crit<br>25 Rdd<br>26 *Rdd, Str 29<br>27 Ranger, EWF: Great Axe<br>28 Ranger, Str 30<br>29 Ranger <br>30 Ranger, Armor Skin<br>31 Ranger,* FE: Humans<br>32 Ranger, Str 31<br>33 Ran, Great Str I (32)<br>34 Ran, Bane of Enemies<br>35 Ran<br>36 Ranger, Grt Str II(34) FE: Aberrations<br>37 Ranger, FE: Outsiders<br>38 Ran<br>39 Ran, Grt Str III (35)<br>40 Bard, Str 36<br><br>Revised version of the old build.  He seems to be a bit more of a melee monster. Especially vs. Favored.  The build gets decent saves again, but for playing I would actually recommend dropping 2 great strength feats and take Bane on a general feat.  This will give you another Favored Enemy, and give you one extra feat to fulfill a weakness in the build: either Epic Reflexes, Epic Fort, IKD, or Expertise.<br><br>Compared with the original version, this one is more powergamer.  A lot more skill points, a lot more damage, much higher AB, higher UMD, more Favored Enemies, etc.  It loses a little RP flavor, IMO.  In worlds where Dev Crit is banned, I think this build gets even better.  It still is a melee machine, and one could easily drop both Overwhelming and Dev Crit and add more Grt Str or more saving throw defenses.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 03/27/09 18:11</span></i></p>

A 36 Natural Strength, along with Bane of Enemies and 7 stacked Favoreds (8 if you follow the other path), with a full compliment of bad-to-the-bone Bard skillset (like to work in Taunt somehow), I wanted him to be even more of a monster than most RDD combos, if such a thing were even possible.<br><br>Still, it is something to consider, especially when playing from the ground up.

I was interested in a dual-wielder RDD/Ranger build, but I wanted to use Bastard Swords.  I traded Lightning Reflexes for Exotic Weapons and Iron Will for Curse Song.  I also shifted 4 points out of DEX and put 1 in STR and 2 in INT, then added the two more Bard levels as recommended... and realized I could simply drop two FEs and add FOUR more levels of Bard for one more to AB!<br><br>That's a loss of two FEs, 2 Will, 1 Reflex, and 1 AC... in order to gain Curse Song, 1 AB, 1 Fortitude, and maxed Hide and Move Silently.  I know there are seven major races in NWN (talking about PvP here), but you can ignore Half-Elves and Gnomes.  The former are too rarely used, and the latter only really make good casters or dexers, so they'll have less HP and perhaps even less AC.<br><br>That's a lot of gain, and the only thing you really lose is the 1 AC - and Curse Song makes up for it!  Unless you're talking PvM, and then I guess the two FEs do count for something.  Dual wielding Bastard Swords does drop the AB by 2 (resulting in a net 1 loss), but that's just my weapon preference.  By all means, go with two Shortswords... by neglecting that proficiency feat, you also get Improved Knockdown!  Middle of the road would be Longswords, which allow IKD and more damage but cost the 2 AB, but keep in mind, it still means a net +2 to AB when attempting knockdowns.<br><br>How about that for a tweak?  Maybe I'll test the build tomorrow and post stats for everyone.<br><br>...Maybe.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By johann_howitzer on 02/20/07 09:33</span></i></p>

More tweaks!  I messed with the feats and ability scores some more and managed to get the same STR in the end, while boosting initial CHA to 11 and dropping WIS to 13.  The upshot of this is:<br><br>- Switching Armor Skin for a Great Strength loses 2 AC, but 1 of that is made up thanks to Mage Armor<br>- Loss of Level 4 Ranger spells, which are junk anyway, except for Freedom of Movement<br>- Gained Bard spells through level 3, which has Keen Edge!  This means the weapon options for the primary hand are greatly increased.  If you have a high-enhancement or high-damage-bonus weapon, you don't have to choose a Keen weapon over it for Dev Critting purposes.  Also Wounding Whispers, useful in PvP at the very least.  I dropped the now-useless 22nd level of Ranger for another level in Bard, which gives a second level 3 spell slot.<br><br>So that's a loss of 1 more AC in exchange for Keen and other juicy Bard spells!  Rangers don't get Bull's Strength or Ghostly Visage, after all.  Ghostly Visage by itself pretty much makes up for that 1 AC.<br><br>Me like!  I think I'll try this build out.  It seems pretty amazing in both PvM and PvP.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By johann_howitzer on 02/20/07 10:10</span></i></p>
