As much as I like your typical DwD tank build, it seems that for standing toe to toe with a big, bad monster, a dex based fighter can do it just as good and get better AC than a decked out fighter in plate armor.<br><br>So, I wanted to create something that had all the goodies of a dex based fighter such as epic dodge and SC V.  I also wanted someone with rogue skills who can handle those tough traps and locks.  This is what I came up with:<br>------------<br>Duck n' Dodge	 	Halfling (Rogue 9/Fighter 12/Shadowdancer 19) <br><br>Stats:<br>Str	10	<br>Dex	20(32)<br>Con	12<br>Int	14<br>Wis	8<br>Cha	8<br><br>Playable 1-40 PvM<br>Alignment: &lt;any&gt; &lt;any&gt;<br><br>(1)  Rogue		Dodge<br>(2)  Fighter		<br>(3)  Fighter		Weapon Finesse, WF - Handaxe<br>(4)  Fighter						(Dex)<br>(5)  Fighter		WS - Handaxe<br>(6)  Fighter		Mobility<br>(7)  Rogue		<br>(8)  SD							(Dex)<br>(9)  Fighter		Knockdown, Imp Knockdown<br>(10) SD		<br>(11) SD		<br>(12) SD			Imp Critical - Handaxe		(Dex)<br>(13) SD<br>(14) Rogue<br>(15) SD			Expertise<br>(16) SD							(Dex)<br>(17) SD<br>(18) Fighter		Imp Expertise<br>(19) Rogue<br>(20) Fighter		Toughness			(Dex)<br>(21) SD			EWF - Handaxe	<br>(22) SD<br>(23) Fighter		<br>(24) Fighter		EWS - Handaxe, Epic Prowess	(Dex)<br>(25) Rogue<br>(26) SD		<br>(27) SD			Great Dexterity<br>(28) SD			Epic Dodge			(Dex)<br>(29) Fighter		<br>(30) Rogue		Great Dexterity<br>(31) SD		<br>(32) SD							(Dex)<br>(33) SD			SC, SC II<br>(34) Fighter		Armor Skin		<br>(35) Rogue	<br>(36) SD			SC III				(Dex)<br>(37) SD<br>(38) SD			SC IV<br>(39) Rogue		SC V<br>(40) Rogue						(Dex)<br><br>AB		42/37/32/27 (Mundane Handaxe)<br>Damage	1d6 + 6 19-20x3 +5d6 Sneak<br>BAB		27<br>Base AC	31<br>HP		388 Max<br><br>Saves:<br>Fort		21<br>Reflex		34<br>Will		15<br><br>Skills:<br>Disable Trap -	<br>Heal -		<br>Hide - 		<br>Move Silently -	<br>Open Lock -	<br>Search -	<br>Spellcraft - 	<br>Tumble - 	<br><br>Good AB, good AC and with imp knockdown and imp expertise, he can tank with the best of them.  He's not completely finished yet.  I have yet to run a test through the epic character builder but all his stats I have done on paper and should be accurate.  I listed the skills I'd like to have, but not sure how many points I have to work with so I left them blank for now.<br><br>If anyone would like to comment, please do.  I'll post the final version this week in the epic builds forum when I have him all nice and tidy. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>P.S. If the rogue levels look weird, it's  because I tried to spread them out over the 40 levels to keep lock picking, disable trap, etc. up to par with his overall level.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Talamier on 10/03/05 00:20</span></i></p>

Ok, I tested in the epic char builder and I missed a feat at level 2.  Silly me but that works out great since I can now take Blindfight which no melee should be without!<br>--------------<br>Duck n' Dodge	 	Halfling (Rogue 9/Fighter 12/Shadowdancer 19) <br><br>Stats:<br>Str	10	<br>Dex	20(32)<br>Con	12<br>Int	14<br>Wis	8<br>Cha	8<br><br>Playable 1-40 PvM<br>Alignment: &lt;any&gt; &lt;any&gt;<br><br>(1)  Rogue		Dodge<br>(2)  Fighter		Weapon Finesse<br>(3)  Fighter		Mobility, WF - Handaxe<br>(4)  Fighter						(Dex)<br>(5)  Fighter		WS - Handaxe<br>(6)  Fighter		Toughness<br>(7)  Rogue		<br>(8)  SD							(Dex)<br>(9)  Fighter		Knockdown, Imp Knockdown<br>(10) SD		<br>(11) SD		<br>(12) SD			Imp Critical - Handaxe		(Dex)<br>(13) SD<br>(14) Rogue<br>(15) SD			Expertise<br>(16) SD							(Dex)<br>(17) SD<br>(18) Fighter		Blindfight<br>(19) Rogue<br>(20) Fighter		Imp Expertise			(Dex)<br>(21) SD			EWF - Handaxe	<br>(22) SD<br>(23) Fighter		<br>(24) Fighter		EWS - Handaxe, Epic Prowess	(Dex)<br>(25) Rogue<br>(26) SD		<br>(27) SD			Great Dexterity<br>(28) SD			Epic Dodge			(Dex)<br>(29) Fighter		<br>(30) Rogue		Great Dexterity<br>(31) SD		<br>(32) SD							(Dex)<br>(33) SD			SC, SC II<br>(34) Fighter		Armor Skin		<br>(35) Rogue	<br>(36) SD			SC III				(Dex)<br>(37) SD<br>(38) SD			SC IV<br>(39) Rogue		SC V<br>(40) Rogue						(Dex)<br><br>AB		42/37/32/27 (Mundane Handaxe)<br>Damage	1d6 + 6 19-20x3 +5d6 Sneak<br>BAB		27<br>Base AC	31<br>HP		388 Max<br><br>Saves:<br>Fort		21 (+4 vs Spells)<br>Reflex		34 (+4 vs Spells)<br>Will		15 (+4 vs Spells)<br><br>Skills:<br>Disable Trap -	43(47)<br>Heal -		43(42)<br>Hide - 		43(54)<br>Move Silently -	43(54)<br>Open Lock -	43(54)<br>Search -	43(45)<br>Set Trap -	24(37)<br>Spellcraft - 	18(20)<br>Tumble - 	40(51)<br><br>Pretty good IMHO.  With decent +5 gear and imp expertise he should be able to hit 70AC or more.  I do have a question on halflings.  I know they get a +4 dodge bonus based on size.  Is that against everything?  Would his effective base AC actually be 35?  If so, that's even better. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>P.S. Do halflings have any restricitions on shield usage?  His spec will be handaxe + shield.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Talamier on 10/03/05 02:01</span></i></p>

Hehe, not to seem like I'm talking to myself, but I thought about changing the build to:<br>Rogue 8/Fighter 12/Shadowdancer 20<br><br>I lose 1d6 sneak.  I gain 14/+5 DR with shadow evade.  Also, I replaced SC V with ESF - Dicipline and moved Figher a bit for that skill.  Post 20 looks like this:<br>---------<br>(21) SD			EWF - Handaxe	<br>(22) SD<br>(23) Fighter		<br>(24) Fighter		EWS - Handaxe, Epic Prowess	(Dex)<br>(25) Rogue<br>(26) SD		<br>(27) SD			Great Dexterity<br>(28) SD			Epic Dodge			(Dex)<br>(29) SD		<br>(30) Rogue		Great Dexterity II<br>(31) Fighter		<br>(32) SD							(Dex)<br>(33) SD			SC, SC II<br>(34) SD					<br>(35) Rogue	<br>(36) SD			SC III				(Dex)<br>(37) SD			SC IV<br>(38) SD			<br>(39) Fighter		ESF - Dicipline, Armor Skin<br>(40) Rogue						(Dex)<br><br>AB		42/37/32/27 (Mundane Handaxe)<br>Damage	1d6 + 6 19-20x3 +4d6 Sneak<br>BAB		27<br>Base AC	31<br>HP		390 Max<br><br>Saves:<br>Fort		21 (+4 vs Spells)<br>Reflex		34 (+4 vs Spells)<br>Will		15 (+4 vs Spells)<br><br>Skills:<br>Dicipline -	42(52)<br>Disable Trap -	43(45)<br>Heal -		24(23)<br>Hide - 		43(54)<br>Move Silently -	43(54)<br>Open Lock -	43(54)<br>Search -	43(45)<br>Spellcraft - 	18(20)<br>Tumble - 	40(51)<br><br>I felt that resisting combat feats would be more important that the last 10% of concealment.  I'm sorta wishy washy on this.  Any input would be greatly appreciated. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>FYI, the reason for all the SD levels is that the PW I play on has shadow evade last 2 rounds per SD level and it is not dispellable.

there are a number of dex-based tanks posted.  i would recommend doing a quick search.  if i remember grizz has at least a few, not to mention many other authors as well.  even i have turned out one or two.  take a look and maybe some of those will give you some ideas.<br>but it does seem like you are doing well enough.<br><br>-c
