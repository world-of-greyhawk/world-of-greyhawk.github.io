Hrm, well it's definitely good, but I still think I prefer the fighter version.  <br><br>What you gain:<br>+5 to saves<br>Divine Wrath (for 2 before RDD 10, 3 rounds afterwards)<br>1 Smite Evil (so +10 damage on one hit a day)<br>Bard song increase - +8HP, +4 to skills (not huge, and you need some perform enhancement to get the full benefit)<br><br>What you lose:<br>Weapon Specialization/Epic Weapon Specilization<br>4 feats (Fighter Bonus feats at levels 1, 12, and 14, plus the wasted Weapon Proficiency Martial<br><br>So you have to decide which list is more important to you basically.  I think for me, I prefer the things you lose to the things you gain, but that's just a personal preference.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 05/26/05 19:29</span></i></p>

Nice build, but I'm going to take you to the Learning Tree:<br><br>First:  Ending with a 16 Int is superfluous.  You already are overflowing with skill points, and your human.  I would start it at 12, and when you gain your RDD +2, then find the opportunity to take IKD (as this is the only thing you have which reguires a 13+Int).  I would take those two ability points and a)put them into Dex for +1 AC, or B) put them into Wis and give yourself a +1 to Wills(he gets -1, but making Wis 10 is like a bonus).  You will still get enough skill points to max Perform, UMD, Tumble, Discipline, Spellcraft and few in other utility ones.<br><br>Second:  I'm not sure what the CoT is really doing for the build, other than saves.  You waste two of its feats that you would otherwise get with a fighter.  Taking fighter would further get you another feat, so you are bleeding 3 feats.  With 3 feats you could have picked up Will, Lightning Reflexes and one other save feat (luck of Heroes), and been almost par with a 10CoT, PLUS you would have WS/EWS.  In this situation, the fighter makes more sense.<br><br>Third:  I like that you maxed Taunt, but why not take the Epic Skill Focus to make it truly effective?<br><br>Fourth: Bardsong, at 20th level you need a 50 Perform(the manual is wrong).  You have a 46.  I don't know about everyone else, but I don't enjoy wearing items that raise my Perform. I'd rather have something else on, savvy?  I would consider, at the least, getting a skill focus:perform for a +3.  That way, you only need a + Chr boosting item to hit 50.  The alternative is to take Epic Skill Focus for a +10.<br><br>Fifth:  I would advise to drop either Lingering, or Lasting Inspiration.  To have both is a bit redundant.  It can be argued that Lingering is good for pre-epic, and lasting is good for Epic.  But just Lingering gives you 20rounds.  That's more than enough.  With extra music, you shouldn't have any problem.<br><br>There was a 6th and a 7th, but I lost my train of thought.  It had to do with Epic Feats...Epic Toughness perhaps...I'll have to go back and look.<br><br>Finally, making all the above changes would, of course, make him look identical to other builds, but that's bound to happen in a closed system.  It's still an effective build.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Steve and Grizzled...thanks for the feedback. <br><br>I was trying to recall why I wanted CoT instead of Fighter in this build...the only thing I could think of was that I was trying to capitalize on the Charisma stat. I don't think I ever created this build in a PW - it sits in my local vault, a neglected 'Project build' along with sooooooo many others! (Anyone for a Harper Druid?)<br><br>Anyhow, great insights and good lessons to learn.

A lot does depend on the world you play in. On the World I play, the CoT is better, but it is a medium/high magic world (+10 enhancement and ability item limits, but they are easily found.  Because of this, AB increases become much more important than extra damage (we actually have no damage reduction items for characters) and a 10th lvl Divine Wrath is quite nice in conjunction with Bard Song, Curse Song, War Cry, and taunt.  <br><br>The main thing with a bard song, anyway, is to get it to the 16th lvl song.  The 20th lvl song is important for duration and to qualify for Lasting Inspiration.  The extra hitpoints and skill bonuses are just that, bonuses.  The AC and Saves at 16th are the meat of the songs.  If you are in PVP with another bard, and you get your curse off first, his curse often does not affect you.  Since AC rules where I play, that is a huge advantage in the long fights (the mod is prmarily PvM, but there is some PvP on occassion) because, if for no other reason, it reduces the AoO that singing sometimes invites.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.rpgmods.net/forgottenworlds/phpBB2/" target="_blank">Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Yar Stardawg on 05/29/05 15:56</span></i></p>

Well I'm a little behind on the discussion here but I'm gonna add my two cents for what it's worth!<br><br>I am definately in favour of the CoT rather than Fighter as part of the build...in fact watch out for my own little version of the Bard, RDD, CoT build...with a very different twist.<br><br>In the world I play in damaging your opponents is much less of an issue than staying alive yourself so Weapon Specialiation &amp; Epic variety come in much less of a concern...keep your eyes out for my build if u like the Bard/RDD/CoT...does it have a name?<br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!

Instead of taking weapon prof martial you could take weapon focus in mace or something like that and then take weapon focus scimitar on a CoT level. That way you save one feat.

Perhaps a better idea would be to take Weapon Focus: Spear, then take WF: Scimitar in CoT levels. <br>This route -- WF: Spear as a Bard -- qualifies for CoT while providing skill with a two-handed weapon (which is very nice because of the high Strength).<br><br>N'est-ce pas?<br><br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br><i>This space for rent</i>

You either use that feat for Martial Weapons or you use it for Weapon Focus:Mace. In either case, you need to take Weapon Focus:Scimitar as a second feat.

However, I'd go with the way you have it. You probably won't use the spear once you have your Scimmy focus anyway, and taking Martial at level 1 allows you to use a wide variety of weapons right from the start, This would allow the character to use any good weapon he finds (barring Exotics, of course).<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
