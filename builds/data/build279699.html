<i> Sneaking, Trapping and Assassinating Enemies PvP and PvM (1-40) </i><br><br><b>NIGHT TALON </b><br><b>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar</b><br><br><br><i>Concept:</i><br><br>The PC default biography on Halflings reads, "You may be short, but you're quick and full of spirit. You've recently wandered into human settlements, eager to see what you can learn from the tall-folk." But this isn’t your true story; while you did enter a human settlement, it was in truth for the purpose of exacting revenge against the humans responsible for killing a member of your family, a beloved merchant held up and killed by some highway robbers whilst en route, which robbers you tracked down and in turn killed, but you were caught. Impressed with your skills, however, Faerun’s powers-that-be gave you a choice: a death sentence for murder in cold-blood, or life as an assassin. You chose the latter. <br><br>Pros:<br> <br>•	Very nice AB. Night Talon has a 44 AB (+2 cat’s/-2 dual-wielding), which is particularly good on an assassin-heavy build.<br>•	Very good AC (“monk like” with a shield) with Uncanny Dodge and Impr.Invis.<br>•	Good HPs (over 400 HPs, which is also really nice on an assassin-heavy build)<br>•	Very nice Death Attack DC <br>•	High Sneak Damage (i.e., 14d6 sneak die (that’s 84d6 sneak/round (84d7 hasted), being wonderful to slice through enemies (incl. DR enemies), with HiPs/stealth for generating attacks<br>•	A nice skillset, including full UMD, good discipline (on par with a str-based warrior actually, and really nice to have on a dex-based build), and also deadly trap skills<br>•	Wonderful synergies/efficiencies between the classes: Ranger for BAB/AB (4 apr / 6 apr dual / 7 hasted), with complementary skills/stealth (bolstered by Ranger and Assassin spells, incl. impr.invisibility and darkness from Assassin, with ranger bringing in ultravision), and SD for evasion, HiPs (which comes nice and early, too).<br><br><br>Cons: <br><br>•	Fort could be better, but reflex is high (and coupled with evasion), will save is low, and you will want to get clarity potions and/or put your UMD to good use and shore it up<br>•	Low damage vs. the sneak immune (i.e., undead, constructs), being typical of dexer-sneakers, and no impr.crit (since sneak doesn’t multiply on a crit. anyway), but offset by UMD and deadly traps (thar be damage)<br>•	Slightly feat-starved and no ED, but in light of the above (HPs, HiPs, UMD, skills incl. traps, discipline, AB and AC, etc.), has all s/he really needs, making ED unnecessary. <br><br>Without any further ado, please meet:<br><br><br><b>Night Talon – Ranger(10), Assassin(28), Shadowdancer(2) </b><br><br>Race: Halfling  Alignment: Any Evil (Theme: CE)<br><br><i> Attributes</i><br>STR: 12<br>DEX: 17 (36)<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 12<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br><i> Level Guide: </i><br>01: Ranger(1): weapon finesse, favored enemy I, {Dual Wield}<br>02: Ranger(2)<br>03: Ranger(3): dodge<br>04: Ranger(4): DEX+1, (DEX=18)<br>05: Ranger(5): favored enemy II<br>06: Ranger(6): weapon focus, dagger*<br>07: Ranger(7)<br>08: Ranger(8): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br>09: Ranger(9): mobility, {Improved Two-Weapon Fighting}<br>10: Assassin(1)<br>11: Shadowdancer(1): {Hide in Plain Sight}<br>12: Shadowdancer(2): DEX+1, blind fight, {Darkvision, Evasion, Uncanny Dodge I}, (DEX=20)<br>13: Assassin(2)<br>14: Assassin(3)<br>15: Assassin(4): knockdown<br>16: Assassin(5): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br>17: Assassin(6)<br>18: Assassin(7): toughness<br>19: Assassin(8)<br>20: Assassin(9): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>21: Assassin(10): epic weapon focus<br>22: Assassin(11)<br>23: Assassin(12)<br>24: Assassin(13): DEX+1, great dexterity I, (DEX=24)<br>25: Assassin(14): great dexterity II, (DEX=25)<br>26: Assassin(15)<br>27: Assassin(16): great dexterity III, (DEX=26)<br>28: Assassin(17): DEX+1, (DEX=27)<br>29: Assassin(18): great dexterity IV, (DEX=28)<br>30: Assassin(19): great dexterity V, (DEX=29)<br>31: Assassin(20)<br>32: Assassin(21): DEX+1, (DEX=30)<br>33: Assassin(22): great dexterity VI, great dexterity VII, (DEX=32)<br>34: Assassin(23)<br>35: Assassin(24)<br>36: Assassin(25): DEX+1, great dexterity VIII, (DEX=34)<br>37: Assassin(26): great dexterity IX, (DEX=35)<br>38: Assassin(27)<br>39: Ranger(10): Epic Skill Focus: Discipline (or: ESF: Set Trap)*, epic prowess<br>40: Assassin(28): DEX+1, (DEX=36)<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br><i>Prefer More Death Attack DC and/or more skills instead of ESF: Discipline? </i><br><br>This build has been optimized for PvP.<br><br>If you prefer an extra death attack DC (i.e., Nat.

Nice, simple DEX based assassin with HiPS and ITWF, it's pretty cool even though I'd prefer Fighter instead of Ranger, because... Ambidexterity, Two Weapon Fighting and Improved Two Weapon Fighting are only three feats, and you already get the DEX pre-requisite, changing 10 Ranger levels for 10 Fighter levels make you end with 2 more feats (counting that you used the epic feat of Ranger 10), EWS comes to mind.

Its all over very good, and a lot more powerful than any sneaker build I ever managed to put together, but there is one thing I curious about: <br>You take Halfling as race, making you small in character size, and yet you dont take Improved Knockdown..? You'll only be able to down some humans and elves with medicore discipline with that, won't you? <br>So, dropping two great dex feats to pick up Imp knockdown and mabye armour skin (giving you a loss of 1 AB and gain of 1 AC).<br>And as a dual-wield build you wont ever use shields will you?<br><br>But apart from that, I personally really like this build, it has many strong sides, and ways to get around some of its weak points too.

As mentioned you wouldn't hit all your attacks unless your foe is already death attack - paralyzed, but then killing it wouldn't be a problem anyway, nevertheless it would prove usefull if you used other ways to stun your enemy which effects are not lasting very long (like the traps).<br>After reading your build, I am now considering using traps with my assassins (I never really used them..). Perhaps with a higher INT, so that I get more skill points (craft, set and disable) and Death attack paralyzation DC too.<br>All in all I think your build is well balanced for special assassin attacks, normal fighting (with your STR and CON values) and defensive abilities (with HiPS), I think it would also make fun with your many ways of fighting: Paralyze- and Darkness-attacks, flanked attacks, grenade attack synergies with Choking Powder or Tanglefoot Bags, HiPS-attacksa and Traps (you also don't have a weapon limitation beside Halfling restrictions and tiny weapons as side weapons (I am used are more specialized, offensive-biased monk build with kama-restriction..))<br>But you wouldn't get early Assassin levels.. if you are a great fan of Assassin fighting and want to use Darkness as fast as possible.

I'd say 2 Rogue levels. Still gives you Evasion as well as 1d6 sneak attack (and will allow you to deal with epic traps).<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Thanks, everyone; such wonderful compliments, questions, and comments all around -- indeed, there is something very satisfying about playing a good assassin, almost as satisfying as coming home from a little R&amp;R to see all of you here and your great comments - thanks! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">     <br><br>I see that most questions have been answered (thanks, guys, you know I appreciate it), so a few words then <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; OK, FTR and “hitting”: (thanks, Thax and Galeab, and nice to see you) - yep, need 13 levels of it to cross-train hide &amp; m/s bef. qualifying for assassin, plus 1 more epics for skills/disc., leaving only 24 levels of assassin which in turn would cost -2d6 sneak, a bunch of skills (cut into traps for e.g.), loss of an assassin bonus feat (i.e., lose a grt.dex), and less death DC to (10+int.mod+assassin level=) 36 (or 37) -- in other words, while ws/ews is nice, I would generally agree, but not worth it here (got traps and umd for that), and really detract from the build; you need lots of assassin for assassination benefits, incl. your death attack of course, as here: DC 40 (or 41), int.cap: 46 (or 47). At this DC, Talon's paralysis makes it all worthwhile (and what works pvp works great pvm, too of course)    <br><br>Paralysis &amp; Stealth/HiPs:<br>For the benefit of newer members, lasts 1 turn (10 rounds)/assassin level (in this case, 280 rounds for you to enjoy your 14d6 sneak, plus any weaponry/umd enhancements you add of course – in other words, wave goodbye to your foe – in the assassination biz, that’s “target terminated” –or- “package delivered” <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">     <br><br>also, traps and umd for non-sneak damage, among so many other things, lets you enhance your weaponry to BioCap (which here, is AB 70 (-2 dual) – but the best thing about being an epic assassin of course, apart from the sheer fun of it all (and all those great options of course, like ManyKamas and Kurth says: options = fun, fun, fun (thanks, guys: appreciate your comments, and nice to see you); That said, and as Thax says (thanks),  ITWF/HiPs to sneak, you’re already strong, this is very true; and if you’re patient … <br><br>Remember, when you “patiently” attack from stealth/HiPs or launch from darkness and wait a few secs, ‘til your foe isn't "in combat" anymore, your target is primed not just for sneak, but for paralysis. Also, and either way, you gain a whole whack of effective AB in which to strike/sneak. This effective AB boost comes in the form of denying your opponent all their dex AC (barring uncanny), and loss also of dodge and tumble AC -- in the case of a melee'r/WM for instance, that's (at least) +10 to your AB, and not accounted for in the above equation – and when your foe is paralyzed, heh heh they’re sitting ducks; So, go forth and paralyze/death attack, then sneak away at your leisure; for those who are paralysis immune (or make a lucky fort roll), they still take your sneak, generating more through stealth/HiPs – hence, paralysis and Hips, far better than KD, though always nice to have options: to paraphrase Shakespeare (or was it his evil twin who wrote): “Oh, how do I carve thee? Let me count the ways! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">     <br><br>Generating Paralysis vs. KD:<br>As noted, KD generates “limited time” sneak opps (to which rogues, base class, are predominantly limited), but KD doesn’t generate the conditions for paralysis (i.e., prone, but not out of combat); that said, nice to have anyway, and as to how it works, that’s a great question Cerolill. Basically, if your attack roll (adjusted) beats your opponent's discipline, they're knocked. It's a two-part test, and here's the formula for you on that:<br><br>"To-Hit"<br>1. Standard Test: Attack Roll (d20+AB (here, 44 (+2 cat's) / BioCap: 70) vs. Opponent's AC (melee'r/WM in +5 world (10 base + 1 dex + 4 tumble+ 8 plate= 23 (26 shield), +5 items: 43 (48 shield), less your stealth advantage -10 AC (as expl. above, to deny as follows: -1 dex, -4 tumble, -5 dodge (boot slot); note: didn't add haste, since typ. melee'r barring a perma-haste item don’t have UMD for haste scrolls, but even if s/he did, it's dodge and would be denied via stealth anyway), meaning: you HIT. (note: in the case of KD, your attack roll for purposes of a KD is penalized -4 for other halflings and gnomes, and -8 for med.sized PCs (everyone else), but as you can see, your stealth alone (when you catch ‘em out of combat; or in combat if they don’t have BF btw, negates penalty, and traps effects do a beautiful job of this, too ... Hmmm, seems size doesn’t matter afterall <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">     <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">      <br><br>2) second part, simple enough: having hit, next part kicks in as follows: if your attack roll (d20 + AB (naked 44 / Biocap 70) less the kd adjustment (-4 or -8) (but not the stealth adj), beats your opponent's total ranks in discipline (taking the melee warrior, whom we'll give a high STR 32, so 54 disc., + 6 str.cap = 60, but -4 disc from darkness (just another benefit, btw <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      -- guess what? (for pvp, don't need IKD; helpful in pvm, as will let you down ogres and giants I agree (but never dragons ... w. that in mind, there's an option above under level guide should anyone want it (and should feel free of course to do so).  <br><br>The Reverse:<br>Now, let's do that in reverse (i.e., someone trying to hit and/or KD you), shall we? Using the 'good warrior" standard AB 45 / 56 w. str. and +5 weapon (note: again, warriors don't typically have umd, so sorry, no true strike or other enhancements for them)<br><br>So, their attack roll (d20+AB 56) vs. your AC (70 w. shield -- note: only penalizes stealth btw a mere -2 which, totally up to indiv. players of course, but really, Talon more than covers off such a minor penalty (i.e., halfling race bonus gives +4 hide, +2 m/s for free, plus ranger spells (cat's, one.w., camou., and also UMD), not to mention impr.invisibility <br><br>-adjustments: stealth/invis. - they can't hit what can't see; darkness, -4 ab (they're blind; wait a sec, w. patience, they're put out of combat by darkness, too ... go paralyse ... opps, sorry, getting ahead of meself); in a straight up fight let's say, one-on-one, they gotta roll to hit to beat your AC, like normal; assuming a high roll, that’s not enough! For they not only gotta hit you, but also get around your impr.invis. (which is invisibility, only better, since it doesn't end when you attack, but becomes 50% self-concealment (that’s SC-V); meaning, half of the hits that would have hit you do not in fact hit you (and if no hit, ... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     <br><br>-In a mid-to-high magic world (+5 environs-plus) note: while ESF: Disc. useful in low magic (and reason why it’s there, as a precaution; but not neces in higher magic settings, as you can see (see level guide for alt. options, as in more death attack DC/skills (there you go); and/or Epic Trap setting w.o the need of any rogue-skilling gear (note: at 45 ranks +10 ESF: set trap=55 ranks, add +4 one.w., and +6 dex.cap only, et voila: 65 ranks (epic traps). As to those traps, heh heh: thanks ManyKamas – yeah, once Kail talked me into playing w. em, well, they’re great! And I never take any sneaker build (nor any dex-build even for that matter) out w.o ‘em – indeed, highly recommended (and thanks)   <br><br>Special PW Question (for those places where assassins get free HiPs):<br>Thanks, Kurth (and long time no see, btw <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      -- yeah, I’ve heard there are PWs give HiPs to Assassins for free (supposed to be rangers, rangers in D&amp;D get free HiPs, but heh, either way, free HiPs? Sounds good to me, too! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">      ) – makes SD unnecessary then (except for evasion), in which case, I totally agree with both Cinn and Thax, depending on your PW and whether you want playability, or Level 40 only<br><br>Playability Considerations:<br>If playability, listen to Cinn—re: rogue – 2 is just the right number to get your evasion,  + another sneak die, so 156d sneak (or: 906d damage/round!), a few more skill points even, and is the only class as Cinn says (and nice to see ya, Cinn!) that can specialize in disabling/recovering epic level traps – I’d def. recommend rogue for playability (no xp burdens, and no changes whatsoever otherwise, just two free feats (where dodge and mobil are) for you to pick up ranged foci (like dem darts (mighty) or sling (bludgeon), or otherwise enjoy as you want)  <br><br>Level 40 (PG Considerations):<br>Level 40: conversely, if looking for a straight Level 40 build, then Thax’s suggestion re: monk is a really good one: 1 monk gives evasion (would net a nasty xp penalty though; avoided by taking at level 40, which would also enable you to take another assassin level <i>(as in, Death Attack DC 41 (or 42) (47 (48) int.cap)</i> – (note: for this, simply bump ranger up for a pre-ep split ranger 10/assassin 10 (+1 BAB/AB, so same AB as now if go for the extra DC option (under level guide); alternatively, enjoy both +1 AB and +1 on your death DC (29 assassin/10 ranger/1 monk) by staying as is otherwise, grab EP instead of ESF: Disc (nets you another AB overall, so: Naked AB 45 (+2 cat’s/-2 dual), taking Exotic Weap. Prof. as one of your freed-feats (for kama, but also other exotics you find – like shuriken, whips, etc.), the remaining feat for as you want (IC: kama, IKD or as you want), picking up an extra assassin level and end with monk at level 40 for the disc. etc. (i.e., free cleave, and monk AC (wis.) boost to boot); would even net you another FE <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">      )<br><br>While Halflings can’t dual-wield kamas, most certainly can and would enjoy the monk’s attack progression (6 apr progression at -3 (instead of 6 apr ITWF on standard warrior’s table); that said, could put ITWF and monk table to use w. a dagger in the off-hand (works fine, so long as have a kama in main hand, and bring on that flurry, too – and that monk AC boost (that’s sweet, too!) (heh heh; guess Thax doesn’t like to be late for lunch! (just teasing <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">      – he knows I like the way he thinks; so, IF on a pw where assassins get FREE HiPs, goin’ level 40 and don’t mind goin’ LE (level 40, folks) …    </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Heh, heh: just a few words, I said! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">      (definitely it’s the professor in me, gearing up once again for the storm, and hence the need for a li’l R&amp;R: seriously, thanks again everyone; appreciate the wonderful interest and great questions, responses, comments and compliments all around (thanks, guys – and always good to see you all!).  <br><br>In closing, just want to say (as I’ve assuredly found) that key to a successful assassination is not only having options at your disposal (different packages require different delivery methods of course), but also patience (to line up your paralysis opps, and/or chip away surely through stealth/HiPs); and if you should find yourself in a party situation where someone, mistaking you for a common rogue and trying to hurry you along w. some lock or such, just stand up slowly, reach out, and smile while you paralyze ‘em – at 280 rounds of it, you’ll teach ‘em patience alright <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">     <br><br>Sneak/Paralyze/Assassinate/Deliver the Package ON! <br>~ Tyr <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 08/07/07 18:12</span></i></p>
