Remember you need Perform 12 for 6th level Bard Song.<br><br>Build Options:<br>If you're a skill nutt, you could move 2 points from CON to INT for the extra skill point goodness.<br>If you're an uber skill nutt, finish with a Bard level at 40th and dump again.  You will lose 1 AA bonus feat.  If you do this, remember to take the last stat increase in CHA, so you can cast 3rd level Bard spells.<br>In fact, this is prly a better build.  If you're willing to tolerate not having the full 30 levels of AA and losing 2 points of DEX.<br><br>Mundane Longbow:<br>+54 AB<br>d8+15 damage<br><br>Notes:<br>Pretty much a crap build.  But at least it doesn't have those goofy wings.  Terrible synergy trying to get dev crit on a dex build, and your threat range is only 19-20.  However; all the other dev crit archers I saw were built with 10 RDD levels, so I thought I'd present another option.  It's a simple build, practically building itself, over half the feats are the 'recommended' ones.<br><br>Side Note:<br>Switching to a crossbow for a ranged dev crit build is no real help.  Sure your threat range is now 17-20, but all your expensivly purchased STR is now useless since +mighty crossbows are few and far between.  Plus crossbows cannot flurry, so you get 3 attacks a round maximum.  But I do have a superior solution... prepare yourself for BBtDDM...<br><br>to be continued...
