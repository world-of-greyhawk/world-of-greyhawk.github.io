Then I started to think of, "how to increase the saves?" Level 10 CoT would work to get you +5 BUT...Blackguard level 2 with 20 Cha is also +5, giving me more levels to use for rogue.  +6 Cha is pretty easy on my server so I stuck with Cha 14.  The high Cha is also driving my fear and helping with UMD, woopie!

I would drop Opportunist and Defensive Roll. Maybe take some improved Sneak Attacks instead, or Skill Mastery (and put some of those left over skill points into Set and Disarm Traps).<br><br>TM

I never played rogue high enough beyond imp evasion and crip.  Epic dodge is definitely out of the question here.  I like the idea that Opportunist adds +4 to your attack roll though.  considering either feared or KD'd that +4 is huge.  Defensive roll was just picked for RP factor.  I was considering the added sneak attack feats though.  perhaps dropping the 2 Great Strengths for them as well.

It will only help when your enemy provokes an AoO, like a spellcaster casting next to you without ICC, or an archer shooting next to you, or someone chugging a potion in combat - in other words, not very often. Even then, you can only have 1 per round. Enemies who are KD'd or feared give you +4 to all attacks even without Opportunist, and apply sneak damage as well (and having Opportunist does not add another +4 in those situations).<br><br>Defensive roll is only useful as a pre-req for Epic Dodge, and since you aren't going for that, I would skip it. It only lets you live 1 hit longer, the only time it's really useful is if that hit comes during the pause before you swallow a potion of Heal.<br><br>TM

I'd personally exchange 2 levels of rogue for 2 more levels of blackguard. Also bump up barbarian to 17.  (Rogue 19, Barb 17, BG 4)<br><br>You'd keep the same sneak attack and you'd qualify for divine might. You'd have a slight HP increase and get another 1/ damage reduction.<br><br>Maybe take divine might instead of the exotic weapon (use a normal longsword) or maybe for epic prowess.  <br><br>If CHA is easy to boost, it could mean an extra 8 damage/8 rounds several times per day.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By coreyb on 02/16/06 23:34</span></i></p>

A couple of other things work like that (sneak attack, wasting attacks if you kill during a flurry without Cleave, etc.).<br><br>TM
