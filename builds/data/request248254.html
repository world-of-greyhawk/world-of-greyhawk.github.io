Well, this "pretend build" would not have a good AB for shortbow, it would only have 3 gaze attacks per shift, and it's AC would be low too.<br><br>"IF" the Medusa (btw:  No "EPIC" Medusa according to standard HotU and patches) had a shortbow, it could get Dev Crit, just like Risen Lord can get Dev Crit.  <br><br>To many "IF this" and "let's pretend that" to even make a worth while helpfull build post on this.  Who knows what else is affected by the Hak.  Whithout knowing that, a person can't give an informed helpfull comment.
