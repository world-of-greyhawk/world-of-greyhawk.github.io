A dexterity-based bard with barbarian levels for uncanny dodge and ab plus CoT levels for the extra epic feats and ab.  I've made a few notes on how to adjust the build if you don't want to bother with all the bard spells.<br><br>Adroit Minstrel<br><br>Bard 29 /Barbarian 3 / Champion of Torm 8<br><br>Race: Human (Halfling or Elf would have xp penalty)<br><br>Starting (Ending) Stats:<br>Str: 9 <br>Dex: 17(36)   <br>Con: 12  <br>Int: 10  <br>Wis: 8   <br>Cha: 16 <br><br>Bard progression: flexible, 16 levels pre-epic <br>CoT progression: flexible, 1 level pre-epic <br>Barbarian progression: flexible, all 3 levels pre-epic <br>Bard 16 /CoT 1 / Barbarian 3 at level 20<br><br>Feats:<br>There is some flexibility with feats:  <br>Curse Song, <br>Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus, Improved Critical,  <br>Toughness,  <br>Combat Casting, (Useful for spells) <br>Dodge, (Useful, but not necessary) <br>Mobility, (Not really necessary) <br>  <br>Take Greater Dexterity for all regular Epic feats. <br> <br>Take Epic Weapon Focus, Epic Prowess, and Armor Skin for three of your epic CoT feats.  You can take Improved Combat Casting for the fourth, take something else (though there aren't many options), or only take 6 levels of CoT total. <br><br>Take Greater Dexterity for two of your epic Bard feats.  Take Lasting Inspiration for the third.  (see note below) <br>  <br>Skills:<br>Concentration: 25 (required for Imp. Combat Casting)<br>Discipline: 43<br>Perform: 43<br>Tumble: 40<br>48 additional skill points to use as you like<br><br>AC: 33 (38 with bardsong)<br>AB: 43 (45 with bardsong)<br>HP: 330 (362 with bardsong)<br><br>Note: If you dont like the bard spells, you can adjust the attribute points and substitute other feats for Combat Casting and Improved Combat Casting.  By adjusting dex to 18 and taking Greater Dexterity instead of Lasting Inspiration, you can end up with 38 dexterity, but you'll probably want to take Lingering Song if you do.
