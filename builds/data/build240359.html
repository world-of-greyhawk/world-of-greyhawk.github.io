It seems obvious that the creator doesn't want to be a direct-damage nuker, and is going to be using death magic, monster charming and holding, and debuffing magic as his primary offenses (probably alongside summons).<br><br>However I'd kind of suggest dropping either the enchantment or transmutation focus (probably the transmutation focus because the transmutation school only has four offensive spells in it) and getting epic mage armor and/or mummy dust.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Petrification can be problematic, however.  I seem to recall that any items carried by a monster that is petrified are permanently lost.  So you can accidentally destroy plot items that way if I'm not mistaken.<br><br>It's possible I am mistaken, of course <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Though personnaly, if I had to swap some feats to adapt the build, I'd rather take epic skill focus concentration to solve the issue you raise : not being systematically disrupted once your dr spells are gone, and / or hellball as an emergency exit spell. Once all the mobs are kded, just cast a GS, find a place to rest, and go back to the fight...But dont forget that between the bibgy lines of spells, the dominated mob at your side, and your high dc death spells, I doubt you'll oftenly be caught in the middle of a melee fight...<br><br>I usually dont take expertise/imp expertise. You may confirm it, but apparently, the extra AC provided by imp expertise doesnt work on every pw. Some pw even consider it as an exploit; I tested it on the pw I play on, and expertise is disrupted as soon as you start casting.<br>This is why I didnt take it, as the expertise issue basically depends of the pw you're playing on, but isnt a "waranty" ac. I consider it as a local factor, then it's up to the player to adapt the build to the pw he plays on...<br><br>Concerning the petrification, I know that if you petrify something on a pw which isnt setup in hardcore rules, logout and come back immediatly after, the duration becomes permanent but I never tested the loss of plot items. I guess ( I hope <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">     ) it was fixed...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Anglashell on 05/14/06 07:35</span></i></p>

Actually expertise gets cancelled <b>after</b> you are finished casting the spell on those PW where the expertise switch is changed. Which means: you cast the spell in expertise mode and immediately after the spell is cast and expertise gets cancelled you reactivate it with the hotkey. <br><br>There's another expertise exploit: you can move around in expertise mode by activating it (by hotkey) immediately after you click on your next waypoint with your mouse. <br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

What do you want Weapon Focus for? Take CoT on lvl 20, to get an epic feat for your bonus feat at wiz20. It will cost you only 1 will save, but increase Fort save (right?) by 2. <br><br>Other than that you could switch WF for expertise too. Don't trust your reciprocal shields to keep you alive either.<br><br>Other than that it seems focused, and well-planned.

You must have Weapon Focus in a melee weapon to qualify for CoT (it's a prerequisite).<br>_________________<br>Where I'm playing now: <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk.</a>

I like the premise of this build.  Very good job utilizing the CoT for the Epic Spell Foci.  I see 2 things that I would change, not sure if you contemplated it or not.  I would drop the Combat Casting feat at level 1, and rearrange your current feats to keep them all in.  You now have freed up 1 feat.  Take your first CoT level on level 20, and move Wizard level 20 to character level 21, you now have moved that 1 extra feat to Epics, this will allow you to pick up one more Epic Spell without changing much of your build.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

That, with the hp are the usual weaknesses of pure casters builds anyway...You still have a high discipline, tumble, interposing hand spell, you can buff your dex, and your umd allows you to use monk robes, or any AC item you can find.

Well no, actually the NWN standard combat AI will use knockdown prolifically if it thinks it can land it based on your AC.  In fact you can have no discipline skill at all, but if you have a high AC the standard AI won't think of trying to KD you (even though it would definitely lay you out if it got lucky).<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
