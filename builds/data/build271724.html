<i> Robbing from the rich and giving to the poor PvM (1-40) and PvP</i><br><br><b>ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY – the Archer’s Story (“Wildwood Outlaw”)</b><br><b>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar</b><br><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>“Riding through the royal forest of Sherwood on a glorious morning … you hear a bird call, the faint rustling of trees, and suddenly a man armed with a longbow appears in your path. He wears a feathered cap, or is that a hood? <br><br>… He is dressed in lincoln green, the colour of Robin Hood -- the most famous English outlaw of all time. Don't worry, he won't harm you -- not yet, anyway. He'll invite you to join him and his outlaw band for a feast. The meal of choice? (Fresh deer). Only a king is allowed to hunt it, but then Robin never did worry about the law. After your feast, Robin…will ask you a question. <br><br>How much money are you carrying? If you answer truthfully, you may keep all that you have. If you need money, then Robin will give…you some. But if you lie - if you hoard your money, ... you won't have that money for very long. You'll be stripped of your clothes and cash, tied backwards on your horse and sent back to Nottingham in shame. And your money? … It will go to help someone in need.<br><br>Most people love Robin Hood … [He] is no common criminal. As the famous saying goes, he robs from the rich and gives to the poor. The poor have little to fear from Robin Hood. His enemies are the rich and corrupt, especially the Sheriff of Nottingham and the bad apples in the Church. … Robin defends the underdog against oppression.”<br><br>Allen W. Wright, “Robin Hood: A Beginner’s Guide” (2004), and available at: <a href="http://www.boldoutlaw.com/robbeg/robbeg1.html" target="_blank">http://www.boldoutlaw.com/robbeg/robbeg1.html</a> </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Method to the Madness:<br>I made a “true-to-life” historical Robin Hood, a plate-wearing knight turned outlaw and philanthropist, based on the real man (or men) who, on returning to England after serving the crusades, became an outlaw on finding not only that his own lands had been seized, but that his countrymen were starving under the rule of King John; in turn, he took to the woods, started up the “merry men” band, and ultimately set about to help the poor.

For those who prefer a more historically accurate Robin, please see the other build (link above); but if the “archer’s story” is how you’ve come to know Robin, then this build’s for you! – Enjoy, and I look forward to all your continuing great comments in respect of this build, or any other in the Wildwood (Robin Hood) Series. <br><br><br>The Build (pros and cons):<br><br>Pros:<br>•	Very good/high ranged AB, with a good melee presence also<br>•	High damage output, thanks not only to his many shots/hits per round, but also bane (which comes nice and early, too), giving the potential to shoot over 200 damage per round!<br>•	Strong trapping skills (i.e., setting all but deadly gas traps)<br>•	Optimized stealth, good HPs (over 450), innate spell casting, and umd-cross trained (scrolls, etc.)<br>•	This appears to be a unique build, being the first to combine AA with epic ranger/bane, covering off all seven (7) player races (hence, nothing short of wonderful damage) <br><br>Cons:<br>•	No uncanny dodge (not really a problem though, in light of HPs, stealth, and damage, incl. traps)<br>•	Low/mediocre saves (especially will save), and you’ll want to shore up same with your umd cross-training and/or clarity potions <br>•	Skills are a bit thin, and could definitely be better, but he has what he really needs.<br><br>Without any further ado, please meet:<br><br><br><br>Robin of Locksley – the Archer’s Story (“Wildwood Outlaw”):<br>Bard(1), Arcane Archer(13), Ranger(26)<br><br>Race: Half-Elf / Alignment: any non-lawful (theme: CG or CN)<br><br>I.

I love this build. Simply do. The beauty of the ranger in this build is that an arcane archer has decent melee presence too, which is not to be brushed aside, at least not when soloing.<br><br>Pure excellence. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Really nice Deb, I like it. There could be small variations as more AA instead of Ranger (damage instead of FEs), or another Bard level for skilldumps, but it's pretty neat as it is.
