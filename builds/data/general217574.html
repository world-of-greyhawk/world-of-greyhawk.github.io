You sure you cant find 1 monk build you dont like?  I used pulse' search for just monk 1-40 and found the following:<br><br>Found 208 matches:<br>Gutsy Monk /Monk 20/DwD 14/Fighter 6<br> --Abadname<br>Silent Death (Monk20/Assassin19/SD1)<br> --AeroBLASTER<br>Stealthy Monk 20/ShadowDancer 5/Rogue 15<br> --Ahriman Dragonhand<br>Monk 29/Sorcerer 1/RDD 10<br> --Aidonx<br>Harper Blademaster {level 30}Monk 20/HScout 5/Fighter 5<br> --Aligory<br>Nice Forest Guy /Druid 33/Fighter 5/Monk 2<br> --Aligory<br>Evil Hunter /Ranger 35/Monk 3/Assassin 2<br> --aluka<br>The Wise One /Cleric 23/Druid 16/Monk 1<br> --aluka<br>A Disgrace To The Family /Monk 6/Paladin 15/SD 19<br> --Amazon Queen<br>Blade Monk /Monk 13/Fighter 2/WM 25<br> --Amzard<br>Spirit Warrior /Monk 14/Fighter 4/WM 22<br> --Amzard<br>The Dragon Druid / Druid 20 /Monk 10/Cot 10<br> --AntonTD<br>Leviathan the Dragon /Druid 22/Monk 8/ SD 10<br> --Anuis<br>Mysterious One (Druid 15/Cleric1/Monk24)<br> --Anuis<br><br>...  and that's half of the A's.  And if you asked the builders, im guessin each one would say they had the best monk build (my charisma based, ftr/pal/monk is the opitime of charisma based monk builds..  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">     *cough* it is also the only one cuz it is SOO misunderstood  LMAO)  <br><br>The hard part of ANY "the best builds" is the player.  The same char you play excellently maybe I'd play terribly.  If you could help us with alittle more info on what you want, it would be terribly helpful.<br><br>peace<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 10/23/05 21:54</span></i></p>
