This is my attempt to create a spellsword using a Druid as a template.  Things to note here is that this char is quite versatile do to a combination of skills and spells.  Totally unbuffed, this char can be a frontline warrior (although the spells are pretty well needed, they are not a must).  The use of offensive spells is allowable, and the combination of movement decreasing spells along with area effect spells can be quite leathal.  The interesting thing to note is that this char has a decent AC without armor, but buffing only raises this slightly (compared with clerics for example).  This is probably the only char designed to wear monk robes and wield a greatsword, without anything else, and still be a competent warrior.  The stealth spells are a nice touch.  There is a good deal of synergy here.  Overall, I am pleased with the results.  I should note that I originally created a dex based version dual wielding kamas.  While the AC was amazing and the attack schedule put many to shame, the damage output was pitiful and the need for damage spells was heavily increased.  This version is a little more balanaced in melee output, using spells for fun and to increase abilities.

I should mention, that the DC for this Char's spells is a good deal better than most other spellswords, since the use of Owl's Insight not only boosts will saves and AC, but also the DC by 6.<br>Also, what do you do when someone wearing monk robes and wielding a greatsword runs at you?  You aren't prepared for them lobbing spells in your direction, that's for sure.<br>Also, if anyone is interested, I will post the dex version of this build, which dual wields kamas with little to no damage, and a lower resulting AB.
