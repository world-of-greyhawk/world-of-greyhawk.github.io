I've been messing around with tank builds a lot lately, and I finally found a build that is unique enough to post. I've been trying to cover some of their weaknesses, mainly saving throws. There is only one other build posted with this class combo, but they are not even remotely similar. The <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117569", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Born-Again Champion</a> by BRIAN FELLOW is a DEXer that uses Sneaks. My build is STR-based and Sneaks are just an added bonus. Plus the level splits are quite different. The problem with this build is the low HP for a tank, so I call it PvM only. Human or Dwarf would be good, but weapon proficiency was a problem. The saves aren't too bad though, and it has Improved Evasion. If you don't want Dev. Crit. (the DC isn't that high anyway) get rid of Dev. Critical, Overwhelming Critical, and Great Cleave. Move EWF to a WM bonus feat, take Epic Prowess as a WM bonus feat, and pick up two more Great Strengths. +2 AB, +1 damage for that. As a side note, I can't wait to recreate this in NWN 2 where CoT will allegedly be replaced with Divine Champion. I don't like the implied following of Torm for my Elf. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  There's nothing wrong with him, I'd just rather pick an Elven god.

Thanks for the post. I totally forgot about Rogue having rapier. I even thought about that as an alternate weapon choice.
