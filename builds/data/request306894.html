You only get +20 to ab.  Your sheet may say more, but you dont actually get it.  <br><br>Here is the highest i have ever seen;<br><a href="http://www.forgotten-worlds.net/old-forum/viewtopic.php?t=2991&amp;highlight=" target="_blank">Wizard 01 / Archer 10 / Arcane Archer 29 </a><br><br><a href="http://www.forgotten-worlds.net/old-forum/viewtopic.php?t=2988&amp;highlight=" target="_blank">Fighter 10 / Barbarian 2 / Weapon Master 28 </a><br><br>These are the most extremes.  Keep in mind, they may use PRC feats as thats what we were using at the time.<br><br>btw, you cant have both highest damage and highest ab.  The highest damage output iirc is some god awful pal/cot great smite 10 or somethin silly, with high charisma.  Make a choice.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 02/28/09 00:51</span></i></p>

You may not be able to get the highest AB with the highest damage, but you can get high AB and high damage, and that's probably one of those WM builds.

if you want damage grab a Red Dragon Disciple with a two handed weapon or a Fighter/Weapon Master with a scimitar, I think those are the best damage dealers. It comes down to sacrificing stats and useful stuff in favor of STR and more STR, so the AC might suffer. Still, WMs and RDDs can get pretty well balanced retaining a lot of damage.<br><br>Try a Bard 23 / Red Dragon Disciple 10 / Weapon Master 7 with as much Great Strength as possible, it deals heavy damage plus lots of criticals, it also has great Bardsong but you'll be literally begging for feats and your saves will probably suck too, can't expect a high AC either. Grab a Greatsword, the critical is still pretty nice with the Greatsword and your base damage will jump sky high, so even against critical immunes, your damage will rock.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/28/09 05:19</span></i></p>
