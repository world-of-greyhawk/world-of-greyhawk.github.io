I've been playign this build for a bit now and it's quite fun, although the dmg doens't quite compare to that of a str based Character with Holy sword defening clang adn Extended Divine favor he packs a puch. But what Really shines is his capability to KD moste opponents Monsters don't stand a chance and only players who invested largely into Disc have a chance. With a Buffed AB with mundane Rapier and +12 Dewxterity his ab is +67/+62/+57/+52, If your taunt is succesful by 6 your ab becomes +73/+68/+63/+58!! And with a Friendly Bard or what not and even that can increase!<br><br>Anyway Here we go<br><br><b>Playable 1 - 40 PvP</b><br><i> (Difficult to play until level 15 or so...<br>Best for PvP servers that start at level 15+) </i><br><br>Dexxer			<br>Race:	Elf		<br>Classes: 	Paladin/23/HS5/Fighter12		<br><br>Stats:			<br>Strength	8		<br>Constitution	8		<br>Dexterity	20		<br>Wisdom	        14		<br>Intelligence	14		<br>Charisma	8		<br>			<br>Lvl			<br>1	Fighter	Weapon Finesse Weapon Focus: Rapier	<br>2	Fighter	Blind Fight	<br>3	Paladin	Allertness	<br>4	Paladin		Dex (21)<br>5	Paladin		<br>6	Paladin	Extend Spell	<br>7	Paladin		<br>8	Fighter		Dex (22)<br>9	Fighter	Iron Will, Weapon Specialization: Rapier	<br>10	Paladin		<br>11	Paladin		<br>12	Paladin	KD	Dex (23)<br>13	Paladin		<br>14	Paladin		<br>15	Paladin	IKD	<br>16	Paladin		Dex (24)<br>17	Paladin		<br>18	Paladin	Improved Critical: Rapier	<br>19	Paladin		<br>20	Paladin		Dex (25)<br>21	Fighter	Great Dexterity I	<br>22	Fighter	Epic Weapon Focus: Rapier	<br>23	Fighter		<br>24	Fighter	Great Dexterity II, Epic Wpn Spec: Rapier	Dex (28)<br>25	Fighter		<br>26	Fighter	Armour Skin	<br>27	Fighter	Great Dexterity III	<br>28	Fighter	Epic Prowess	Dex (30)<br>29	Paladin		<br>30	Paladin	Great Dexterity IV	<br>31	Paladin		<br>32	Paladin		Dex (32)<br>33	HS	Great Dexterity V, Great Dexterity VI	<br>34	HS		<br>35	HS		<br>36	HS	Great Dexterity VII	Dex (36)<br>37	HS	Great Dexterity VIII	<br>38	Paladin		<br>39	Paladin	Epic Skill Focus: Discipline	<br>40	Paladin	Epic Toughness	Dex (38)<br><br><br>Important Stuff:			<br><br>Final Stats:			<br>Strength	8		<br>Constitution	8		<br>Dexterity	38	50 with +12 dex, which is a +20 Bonus	<br>Wisdom	        14		<br>Intelligence	14		<br>Charisma	8		<br><br>Skills:			<br>Tumble:	40	54	40 of those go to AC, the rest for tumble Checks<br>Discipline	43	52	With Epic Disc Items Can be 75+<br>Listen	43	45	With Listen Gear on can be reasonable<br>Lore	6	Required for HS	<br>Persuade 8	Required for HS	<br>Search	4	Required for HS	<br>Taunt	37	Good For Decreasing Opponents AC	<br>			<br>AB with Mundane Rapier	48		<br>AB With +12 Dex, and buffed	+67:	Also +6 if the taunt Roll is 6 greater then the opponents con Roll +73!<br>AC Naked 34		<br>AC with +5 stuff and +12 dex, Hasted	72		<br>Max HP:	340		<br>			<br>Things to look for in Equipment:		<br>AC:		<br>Boots		<br>Bracers		<br>Cloak		<br>Amulet		<br>Tower Sheild		<br>		<br>Haste		<br>Dex +12		<br>		<br>Would be nice if:		<br>Str +12 For Dmg and Disc		<br>Con +12 for HP		<br>Listen Gear		<br>Disc Gear		<br>Cha +12 For Saves		<br>		<br>Buffs:		<br>Divine Favor, Extended and Regular		<br>Defening Clang, Extended and Regular		<br>Bless		<br>Aid		<br>Prayer		<br>Holy Sword		<br>Greater Magic Weapon		<br><br><br>Pros:<br>Decent Dmg, good for a dexxer with Paladin Buffs<br>38 base ac is nice, add some good equipment and perhaps a bard and it can stand up to most things.<br>Killer AB especially for a melee character<br>Helpful buffs i.e Protection from alig, Deathward etc<br>On hit dispell from Holy Sword<br>With Good gear his Disc makes him reletively un-KDable which is rare with a Dexxer<br>Taunt Skill<br><br>Cons:<br>No Uncanny, hence the epic Skill Focus Disc so you don't get KD'd and the Listen so you don't get sneaked.<br>HP is poor due to 8 con and 1d6 from HS lvls<br>Saves could use some help from Items, although +12 charisma adn Tymora's smile help.<br>No Sneak Attacks So IKD just means they can't hit you whilest there, and they loose AC<br><br>Comments Criticisms?<br>_________________<br>~I am the wisest man on earth because I know one thing, and that is I know nothing.~<br>-Cairne<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 10/12/05 00:36</span></i></p>

You will have serious trouble early on. Where do you plan to get damage from? And a quick debuff when fighting (it happens) what then? Buffed it's probably good 1 on 1. What in a 4 on 4 PvP, two people with sneak attacks carves up a dex build in no time. What when you fight mobs of monsters. Can you defend against sneakers? I'm not saying you can't survive, I just wanna know how.<br>As said, on lvl 40, very strong 1 on 1. But is it a straigth level 40 build? <br>Nothing wrong if it is, you know.

Vs. a HiPS Sneaker... well you need True seeing anyway so any non Cleric/Mage build woudl have trouble. Vs. Multiple Foes, Since his AC woudl increase with the lvl of magic items it goes up, though most builds except A DD or soemthing to that effect have trouble when massed by PC's. <br><br>Unless you want to Gimp your character, most Dex based builds are tough at first, your ab is higher thren a str based fighter, though your dmg is worse,I can't think of too many Dex builds that aren't like that. Unless of course you get rid of something on order to do that.  I Don't recall what lvl i had it at but you could put Weapon Finesse at lvl 1 anfd move Focus to lvl 2 I might already have that though... <br><br>I played this build from 28-40 on a PVP Server I leveld him differently because I didn't have to worry about feat order so much. Like I said not having Epic dodge or Uncanny Dodge is a bit of a pain when it coems to groups, though you only loose your dex ac if flatfooted, and your Disc can get high enough so KDing you is tough. <br><br>It's not a perfect build of course, but the objection was a High ab, good ac, Good listen and Disc. Though if you want more playability, or to make it easier at lvl 1-15 or whatnot, then yes you shoudl change things around, but it will be weaker at lvl 40. You coudl dump Fighter, go Rogue for uncanny, adm Epic Dodge, loose some feats, and some ab  But get sneak attacks so more dmg that way, but hit less and KD less.<br>_________________<br>~I am the wisest man on earth because I know one thing, and that is I know nothing.~<br>-Cairne

Also i think goin Greatsword is better for dmg and Ikd, and possibly half-orc

I wasn't talking about HipS opponents, they don't have to be hidden to sneak attack, two people are enough. Or Darkness. You lose dex and dodge AC when someone sneak attack you. Compared to a strength build his heavy armor will be the difference when sneaked, and he deals more damage.<br><br> A strength based char doesn't get lower AB, he gets lower AC. Without uncanny dodge you will have trouble, believe me. Playing him from lvl 28 makes him better, of course.<br><br>Dex characters are tougher early on, yes, but most get sneak attack, WS or at least a little strength.<br><br>I think this is a strong char if you avoid getting sneak attacked (which will be tough) and don;t have to play the earliest levels.<br><br>I am not butchering your build, i see his strong points. But I give advice on what his clear weaknesses are. <br>Peace. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

No Problem, thanks for the advice, though not sure how you would have a better chance vs Sneakers? I mean there's PM obviously, adn I suppose with Dwarven Defender DR adn Stance that protects you. The uncanny Dodge is one thing, but I'm pretty sure unless they attack you from an invisible position i.e HiPS or high enough HIde/MS or KD you you don't loose Dex bonus? Unless I am mistaken. Switchign Fighter with Rogue woudl decrease your AB a bit, you'd go like 20/15/5 Pali/rogue/HS loose a bit of ab, and go Rogue Post epic to keep the BaB high, gain Epic Dodge, loose some non-sneak Dmg and an extra Paladin feat... Different way to go about it, but still get the 38 dex, Paladin buffs, and HS bonuses.<br>_________________<br>~I am the wisest man on earth because I know one thing, and that is I know nothing.~<br>-Cairne

My comments are made from things learned the hard way, in the field of struggle.<br>A little info.<br> When someone sneak attacks you in NwN you count as flat-footed for some reason. That is different from PnP. I have earlier in my career with a monk learnt this. It was not dex based, but it still has quite a few AC from it.
