K, <i>this is meant as a support build only,</i> though it can do it's own damage by keeping it's damage shields up while forcing people to attack it through the taunt ability (most people would suffer up to 72 damage just from acid sheath and whispers alone)<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: CE crazy m0f0 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  <br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 14<br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Wis 10<br>Int 16<br>Cha 14 (dump all points here)<br><br><br>Leveling<br><br>1  Bard 1 - curse, sf: disc<br>2  Bard 2 -<br>3  Bard 3 - toughness<br>4  Bard 4 -<br>5  Bard 5 -<br>6  Bard 6 - great fort<br>7  Bard 7 - <br>8  Bard 8 -<br>9  Bard 9 - max spell<br>10 Bard 10 - <br>11 Bard 11 -<br>12 Bard 12 - power attack<br>13 Bard 13 -<br>14 Bard 14 -<br>15 Bard 15 - extend spell<br>16 Bard 16 - <br>17 Bard 17 -<br>18 Bard 18 - cleave<br>19 BG -<br>20 BG -<br>21 Sorc 1 - Epic fire resist*<br>22 Sorc 2 -<br>23 Sorc 3 -<br>24 Sorc 4 - ESF: Disc<br>25 Sorc 5 -<br>26 Sorc 6 -<br>27 Sorc 7 - Armourskin<br>28 Sorc 8 - <br>29 Sorc 9 -<br>30 Sorc 10 - Epic Fire Resist<br>31 Sorc 11 - <br>32 Sorc 12 - <br>33 Sorc 13 - Epic fort <br>34 Sorc 14 -<br>35 Sorc 15 -<br>36 Sorc 16 - Still spell<br>37 Sorc 17<br>38 Sorc 18 -<br>39 Bard 19 - ESF: Taunt<br>40 Bard 20<br><br>* I took a secind EER fire resist, because of the fact that heal kits are common and cheap in the servers I play, and the -20 fire reduction can be a real life saver against flame arrow, and other fire spells.

Maybe it's an idea to drop bard down to 16 and pick up more Sorc levels and get EMA/Epic Warding on the 2 Epic Sorc levels you'll get (time them so you get them at the same time as general feats). After all, you aren't going to fight melee (right?) so you may as well take more sorc levels pre-epic for playability. It seems like a pure level 40 build as it is. You'll get more firepower from your extra Sorc levels (and more importantly, full sorc spells) and still retain most of your good bard spells and bardsong.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.
