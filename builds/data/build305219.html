Yay, another sneak build from me!  Not quite a dragon that can hide in the bushes, but there's still something quite cool about sneaking up on someone while and smacking them over the head with the D&amp;D equivalent of a 2x4.<br><br>It's a sneak weaponmaster build with devastating critical, really good against tanks (and on worlds where True Sight is nerfed, against mages too).  Not quite as good against bards (they can see him and also curse him for -15 hide/MS) or clerics (they can see him and kill him with Implosion).<br><br>It may seem similar to a few other builds, mainly the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "170358", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Hidden Axe</a>, the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "240420", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Silent Knight</a> and a few other dexterity-based versions, but in reality it's different.  I like my version better because it gets devcrit and generally higher AB.  And frankly, I don't see much point in making a dex-based WM, especially with only 7 levels.<br><br>Playable 1-40, both PvM and PvP.  Gets better at both at level 22.<br><br>There's two ways to equip him - sword and board and go for AC and crit range with a scimitar in addition to hips (his AC will be the same as with a regular tank WM, the only thing he doesn't get is UMD).  This way you can tank and hips only when you need to, however you get a -10 penalty to both Hide and Move Silently.  Or you can use a greatsword and wear medium/light armor to avoid armor penalty, relying on to keep you safe.<br><br>Human, any alignment<br>Fighter 12/Weaponmaster 25/Shadowdancer 3<br><br><b>Ability Scores:</b><br>STR 17 (30)<br>DEX 13<br>CON 14<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8<br><br><b>Leveling guide:</b><br>1.

At the same time your advantages don't amount that much in the same environment - you don't need the WM AB if everyone's AC isn't much higher than 60 (and clerics get a higher AB here anyway), most classes that took spot/listen with ESF will see you, your AC isn't that high and you won't get enough +save items to get 48ish or so fort that you need to save against Devcrit<br><br>It is awesome, however, in high-magic.  Best AB short of Pally/RDD, hips that no-one except dedicated anti-sneaks will see you and if you find yourself getting mobbed or losing a fight... well, you can always disappear.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 04/29/09 18:14</span></i></p>

I've never investigated how well HiPS works on STR based builds, I prefer just to buff True Sight all day when I wander around, but I suppose it could work nice if you're good at hiding and that stuff, mind me I don't know how to do that.<br><br>The only thing I will criticize is the name, if a sentence can actually be called a name.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 01/07/09 02:47</span></i></p>

STR sneaks do well, since they can attack someone who's flat-footed all the time, but at the same time if they're fighting head on, they're not losing out on damage.<br><br>Ooops, forgot to mention skills.<br><br>42 (62) Discipline<br>43 (54) Hide<br>43 (54) Move Silently<br>13 (15) Spellcraft<br>40 Tumble.
