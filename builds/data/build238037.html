well im fairly new to building characters and not that adept at analysing them<br><br>looks good to me - however why take that last great wisdom?<br><br>may as well use it on another feat and finish on 30 wisdom - you will have the same bonus's and pretty sure you only need 30 wisdom for dragon shape<br><br>im sure someone will be along soon to make a better review of your build though...

Actually, I hate to break it to you, but it's impossible this way, too. The Great Wis feat does not count for pre-reqs until the next level up. You need to have a wis of 30+ by level 36 to take it, or get a bonus feat on level 40.<br><br>So take Monk at level 39, skip the Great Wis feat for something else, and take Dragin Shape at level 40 (Druid level 28 bonus feat).<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 04/22/06 00:03</span></i></p>

I'd ramp up the ranger levels to 21, and take Bane of Enemies.  This will do an additional 2d6+5 favored enemy damage to Dragons, in addition to all other damage. Same for your other other favored enemies; I recommend at least constructs and undead, as they are immune to crits and the extra damage comes in handy, humans and elves if this is for PvP.  I was astounded when I looked at the search engine and came up with exactly ZERO Bane of Enemies Dragon builds.  Level split would be Ranger 21/Druid 17/Monk 2.  Add power attack and improved power attack and you'll munch through the highest DR with ease.<br>_________________<br>Vulcano's <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&amp;id=6522" target="_blank">Bard Studio</a> (in beta, 1.67).  *Updated*  Compose, play, and save your own bard music dynamically in game!

For Dragon Shape (or elemental shape for the matter) WF/EWF: unarmed are totally useless since they don't work. Get EP and AS instead, you'll get +1 AB, +2 AC. <br><br>I'd rather go Druid 24/Monk 6 for another +1 AC, increased speed and free IKD. <br><br>Notice that Druid 12, Ranger 8 preepic would net you the same AB and saves but you could pick EP instead of FE on 10th ranger lvl.<br><br>I'd start with WIS 17, STR 11, DEX 10 or WIS 18, STR 10, DEX 10, CON 12. Your physical stats are gonna get overridden anyhow. <br><br>I'd get in empower spell.<br><br>Why ending on a WIS odd score when you can end on an even score easily?<br><br>Greater Ruin is no big deal also, you might want to consider swapping it for something else (like a Great WIS).<br><br>Your Dragon Shape stats are off the mark also:<br><br>AB =  50 (27 BAB +19 STR mod +6 dragon claws -2 huge size)<br>AB (buffed) = 56 (27 BAB +25 capped STR mod +6 dragon claws -2 huge size)<br><br>to which you add druid bonus in wilderness areas.<br><br>AC = 59 (10 base +13 DEX mod +10 WIS mod +8 tumble +20 dragon dodge AC -2 huge size)<br>AC (buffed) = 72 (10 base +15 DEX mod +16 WIS mod +8 tumble +20 dragon dodge AC +5 natural AC enhancement from barkskin -2 huge size)<br><br>plus Expertise/IE when in use.<br><br>EP will net +1 AB, AS will earn you +2 AC, 5 lvls of Monk will give another +1 AC, 32 base WIS will net another +1 AC. So potentially you can get:<br><br>AB: 51/57 buffed<br>AC: 63/76 buffed<br><br>Saves in DS should be:<br><br>For 35/39 buffed<br>Ref 29/32 buffed<br>Will 30/37 buffed<br><br><br>About skills: spellcraft works on modified multiples of five, tumble on base ranks multiples of five. Therefore stop tumble at 40 base ranks and spellcraft at either 38 or 43 (if taking last lvl as druid)<br><br><br>A ranger heavy dragon build would be an alternative, I've got one waiting to be released... if no one beats me to it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Wait for me Dragon, we'll meet in the sky<br>By fire and magic, I'm sworn<br>Hell is calling, we cannot be denied<br>Fly to the blackness of the Storm<br><br>We must die to be reborn!
