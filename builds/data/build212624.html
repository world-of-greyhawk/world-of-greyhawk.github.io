Alas for the poor 1/2 Orc! Maligned, vilified, ignored. I felt I had to do something to rectify this situation and came up with this. This is a pure melee character, designed to get a good AB and still be reasonably versatile and effective. <br><br>Harper's Vengeance<br><br>FTR 16/WM 19/HS 5<br><br><b>Playable 1 to 40, PvM</b><br><br>1/2 Orc, any non-evil<br><br>STR 18<br>DEX 14<br>CON 14<br>INT 13<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 6<br><br>1 )FTR1: Weapon Focus:Battleaxe/ Knockdown<br>2 )FTR2: Dodge<br>3 )FTR3: Mobility<br>4 )FTR4: Weapon Specialization:Battleaxe/ INT (14)<br>5 )FTR5<br>6 )FTR6: Blind Fight/ Expertise<br>7 )FTR7<br>8 )FTR8: Spring Attack/ STR (19)<br>9 )FTR9: Whirlwind Attack<br>10)WM1<br>11)WM2<br>12)WM3: Iron Will/ STR (20)<br>13)WM4<br>14)WM5<br>15)WM6: Improved Critical:Battleaxe<br>16)WM7: STR (21)<br>17)WM8<br>18)WM9: Alertness<br>19)WM10<br>20)FTR10: Weapon Focus:Heavy Flail/ STR (22)<br><br>21)FTR11: GRT STR I (23)<br>22)HS1: Epic Will*<br>23)HS2<br>24)FTR12: GRT STR II (24)/ Epic Weapon Focus:Battleaxe/ STR (25)<br>25)FTR13 <br>26)FTR14: Epic Weapon Focus:Heavy Flail<br>27)HS3: GRT STR III (26)<br>28)WM11: STR (27)<br>29)WM12<br>30)WM13: GRT STR IV (28)/ Weapon Of Choice:Heavy Flail<br>31)WM14<br>32)HS4: STR (29)<br>33)WM15: GRT STR V (30)<br>34)WM16: Epic Prowess<br>35)WM17<br>36)WM18: GRT STR VI (31)/ STR (32)<br>37)HS5: Epic Skill Focus:Discipline*<br>38)WM19: Armor Skin<br>39)FTR15: GRT STR VII (33)<br>40)FTR16: Epic Toughness/ STR (34)<br><br>*These could easily be swapped, depending on your needs.<br><br>AB: +50 (with both weapons)<br><br>Naked AC: 22<br>With mundane plate and shield: 32<br><br>Max HPs: 480 (you could opt to drop KD and take Toughness to get this to 520)<br><br>Saves (vs spells):<br>Fort: 22 (26)<br>Refl: 22 (26)<br>Will: 21 (25)<br><br>+2 vs traps (Deneir's Eye)<br>+2 vs mind-affecting (Lliira's Heart)<br>+2 boost on all saves for 5 turns 1x/day (Tymora's Smile)<br><br>Skills (174 points)<br>Discipline: 43 (65)<br>Tumble: 40<br>Spellcraft: 18 (20)<br>Intimidate: 4<br>Search: 4<br>Lore: 6<br>Persuade: 8<br><br>17 left over.<br><br>Once again, a build with focus in 2 different weapons, but specializing in only 1. The reasoning is: with the high STR and 1.5x STR modifier, the +6 damage from EWS isn't absolutely essential for the Heavy Flail. This would be the weapon choice vs creatures with damage resistances and DR (typically the same ones that are immune to criticals, which is the reason there is no Imp Crit feat for the Heavy Flail as well).<br><br>The saves aren't great, but they're not terrible either.<br><br>HPs may be a concern for a melee character. Toughness is offered as an option (see above). I have a Dwarf version that ends up with a lot more HPs and only 1 less AB and damage, which I'll post in a separate thread.<br><br>Anyway, I feel this is a decent build and something that should win a modicum of respect for the poor, neglected 1/2 Orc.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 09/15/05 13:11</span></i></p>

Was just on the search engine and saw this build along with the Dwarvern version...I got a Halfling with the same level combinations but that is sooooo completely different it's astounding!<br><br>I went for the Dex option, ending up with 38 Dex <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">  , using a Handaxe, x4 criticals with a 53 unbuffed attack bonus! Still needs a couple of refinements/tweaks but I may post it soon...<br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!

I'd thought about a high DEX version of this as well, but was uncomfortable not having Uncanny Dodge with so much AC coming from DEX.

Nice build... yay harper scout!  Being able to use two weapons with different damage types is a really great option for fighting various undead.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
