This build is for defence and a small chunky on the offence side. <br>1-6 Fighter<br>7-13 WM<br>14-23 DD<br>24 Fighter<br>25-40 DD again<br><br>Would this disrupt the chain of which the EDR is progressed through out even though your still getting a 27/- EDR resis, along with the added +6 dmg to build? <br>Becasue at 6 i took Weapon Spc for +2, then epic wep focas at 24 during the fighter lvl any questions or would you want me to write the build out on the forums for closer examination?

Not sure what you mean by 'disrupt the chain' of EDR. Can you clarify that? As for posting the build, that's always a good idea to get some feedback. People may see things you can do to tweak it that you may have overlooked.<br>_________________<br>Captain's Log, Stardate 6051: had trouble sleeping last night... my hiatal hernia is acting up.

Well, as I can read the class spread you start off with Fighter to get all the feats for Weapon Master, and Dwarven Defender after Weapon Master, since it's faster to get the crits than the DR, Fighter at level 24 is obviously for Epic Weapon Specialization, so it's a perfect choice to take at that point, ending as Fighter 7 / Weapon Master 7 / Dwarven Defender 26, where the Dwarven defender level is left just as he gets a bonus feat.<br><br>I know that getting EDR soon is best for playability, what he means by breaking the chain is that he'll be taking Epic Weapon Focus at level 21 and Epic Weapon Specialization at level 24, instead of EDR, so he's pushing it a bit late on purpose, but I consider it's better to actually do so or else you'll end with nothing to fit in your Dwarven Defender bonus feats, as it's more convenient to use the regular feats on Great Strength.<br><br>I think it's good, you get the crits from Weapon Master and the DR from Dwarven Defender, so it's a pretty straightforward build and all, though I don't know what you're asking for, as Cinnabar Din said, it's easier if you post the build and we can help you manage stats, skills and feats if you have a problem with that, but the class level spread is perfect if you ask me.
