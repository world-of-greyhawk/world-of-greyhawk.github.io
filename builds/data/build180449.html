This will cost you one epic AA bonus feat.  I'll leave this as an exercise for the reader.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 02/20/05 12:17</span></i></p>

Bah, wrong wrong wrong.  I read about Extended True Strike in someone else's similar build today, and got all excited about it without checking it out.  But it's wrong.  Extended Spell doesn't work with True Strike.  Bummer.<br><br>Anyway...<br><br>To fix the build, swap levels 9 and 18, that is, take Sorcerer at 9th and Paladin at 18.  Take either Divine Shield or Extra Turning at 18 instead of Extended Spell.  And dump skill points into Taunt at 18 instead of spellcraft.<br><br>I like Extra Turning, but I can see people prefering Divine Shield.<br><br>And while I'm ranting, 30 minute limit on editing my posts is bogus.  &lt;/rant&gt;<br><br>hmmm, I wonder if any other metamagic works with TS.....<br><br>[edit: Quicken Spell is the only metamagic that works with TS.

Damn, I was hoping to not have to explain this.. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Ok, so normally the TS lasts 9 seconds.  This gives you 1 round of +20 AB, because the spell actives in the middle of the first round and lasts till the end of the first<br><br>seconds----&gt;<br>--1--2--3--4--5--6  7--8--9--10-11-12-13-14-<br>&lt;-- round 1 -----&gt;&lt;---- round 2 ----&gt;&lt;-- round 3--<br>&lt;-- TS -&gt;&lt;--------- +20 AB ---------&gt;<br><br>But... If you're hasted, you get 2 spells in a round.  So if you cast TS as the 2nd spell....<br><br>--1--2--3--4--5--6  7--8--9--10-11-12-13-14-15<br>&lt;-- round 1 -----&gt;&lt;---- round 2 ----&gt;&lt;-- round 3--<br>&lt;-spell-&gt;&lt;-- TS -&gt;&lt;--------- +20 AB----------&gt;<br><br>So your TS lasts into the 3rd round, enough for the 1st flurry in that round.  Now the fooly cooly part is the 1st spell can be 'Divine Might'.  So while hasted, you just queue up:<br><br>Divine Might<br>True Strike<br>Rapid Shot<br>Attack<br><br>And your next 8 attacks get +20AB/+cha(divine) damage.<br><br>For the build, if you wanted to swap out a feat and pick up Weapon Finesse, you could do the same in melee.  For 5 attacks + 2 attack from the 3rd round you can 'Divine Strike'

If your gonna call it divine strike bowman, why not actually put in some points into cha?  Your ab will be more  than high enough.  I'd suggest going more like 8 pally, 3 wiz 29 aa and get ennough cha you can get more than +10 on the divine.  You'll prolly end up being a support char anyway so the ac from the dex isnt that important.

If you take other than 5/5 in Pal/Sor you'll take MC penalties.<br>As far as shifting DEX to CHA, that's a good build option.  I actually had that in the first description I wrote that was lost when my internet dropped.  I forgot that part when I rewrote it.<br>In practice, I ended up moving 4 points from DEX to CHA at the end of the build since I had enough AB to beat the monster I built this for.  With magic, this gave me +10(divine)damage for 10 rounds, 19 times a day (w/ Extra Turning)<br>And I considered taking a level of Sorc at the end for the Spellcraft and 3rd level spells, but just decided not to mess with it.

How many spells you want depends on the mod.  If you can get the items, you won't need the buffs.  I don't think a lvl 5 sorc gets lvl 3 spells, so you'd prolly want that 6th lvl of sorc.  I was suggesting going with 3 lvls of wizard since you're an elf(favored class and all).  Pre-epic would be 8 pally 2 wiz 10 AA for a BAB of 19(as opposed to 17 for a pally 5 sorc 5 AA 10).  Lvl 8 pally gets lvl 2 spells which would get you eagles splendor, aid, bulls, or aura of glory.

Ah, I see. I didn't notice you were changing it to Wizard.<br>I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish with your changes, but that would be far far worse for what I designed this to do.<br><br>He's built to shoot the most number of True Strike+Divine Might arrows into a guy that has 70-90 AC and lots of damage resistance/immunity.<br><br>Changing to Wiz gives him like 3 or 4 TS instead of the 8 or 9.  Plus you have to move a bunch of stats around... basically he becomes another character entirely.  Which is fine, but not what I'm shooting for (pun intended).<br><br>In practice, he worked out great.  I was able to solo a couple of boss monsters that had previously only been beaten by swarms of IGMS, or by a crew of adventurers who kept rotating out to rest and heal and rez.

Oops!  Never even considered silent and still feats.  I just hate them so much.  Well, that's not true.  I just never take them as feats.  I guess Still Spell would be pretty good for early in your career if you wanted to armor up.  And in any case, either would get you more TS in the aggregate.<br>Oooh, wouldn't an Empowered TS rock?  +30! *drools*<br>Thanks, I'll have to investigate this.<br><br>I dont like half-elves, cus half-elf is teh s uck. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Also I want at least 4 levels of Sorc to get base 6 1st level spells a day, plus 2nd level spells, and it's not worth it go 1/2 elf for 4sor/6pal instead of 5/5 for elf.<br><br>Now if you aren't interested in True Strike, this is NOT THE BUILD FOR YOU.  There are a lot of better ways to get Divine Might and be an archer.  This build is about DIVINE MIGHT AND TRUE STRIKE AT THE SAME TIME.  Sheesh!  That's why I called it 'Divine Strike' Bowman.<br><br>I appreciate the feedback.  That Still/Silent feat sugestion rocks, thank you again.  However; I do not want to dilute or divert the intention of the build, and giving up True Strike makes this into some entirely different character.

Oh sure, be all reasonable so I sound like a raving looney. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   Excuse my frustration. I was at not getting my point across well.
