Well, the true answer is because I like elves and disregard experience penalties because, after all, there are no experience penalties when you are forty.  But if I am building without any ability to employ true sight, I usually prefer modal detect to give you some chance to either spot or listen to any sneakers/hipsters.  With Amplify, this one's listen check will be quite high.<br><br>Ithacan

Hi Ithacan.  Very nice build here.  Looks like it'd be pretty tough in PvP.  I have a question, though, about the Epic feat selection:<br><br>33 Barb 13 EER: Fire<br>34 Barb 14<br>35 Barb 15<br>36 Bard 17 STR 25; ESF: Discipline<br>37 Bard 18<br>38 Bard 19<br>39 Bard 20 Lasting Inspiration<br>40 Barb 16 STR 26<br><br>Specifically, the lvl 33 feat.  Could you not omit the EER, and take ESF: Discipline at that level (as I assume you have more than 20 ranks in it by then), and then add either Terrifying Rage, or Thundering Rage?  You'd meet the Greater Rage requirement for both (lvl 15 Barb) by lvl 36, and the Str requirement (25) for Thundering.  I would think the either the extra damage on crits, or additional AB penalties from Terrifying would go nicely with Curse and such.
