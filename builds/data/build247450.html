I'll be fast, have got just a few minutes. Bard has got Discipline as a class skill no need for CoT to max it. Get that Dev Crit earlier lad. Also pump up your WIS first, you spend a long time without access to higher level spells and that ain't wise.<br><br>I'd move 2-3 CoT lvls in Epic, drop Called Shot, get EP and most importantly <b>exploit Divine Power</b>.

*Smacks himself in the head.* Yeah, I forgot Bard got Discipline as a Class Skill(Because...I always thought they shouldn't, but...Eh. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> ). Mmmm, but yeah, get it earlier in that case.

It looks very nice, Cleric and CoT were made for each other, quite the little monster you have here.  My one complaint is the fortitude save.  If you plan to PvP in a dev. crit. environment it's a good bet your opponent has dev. crit. as well and your forititude save isn't up  to the task.  I have a few suggestions that can shore that weakness up a bit and make your build better.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/20/06 20:21:42 (GMT) -- DragonRaider69<br><br>Str: 16.<br>Dex: 8.<br>Con: 12.<br>Wis: 16.<br>Int: 14.<br>Cha: 8.<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Change this to:<br>Str: 16.<br>Dex: 8.<br>Con: 14.<br>Wis: 15.<br>Int: 14.<br>Cha: 8.<br><br>And use your 1st attribute bonus to increase wisdom.

Weapon Proficiency: Martial, Toughness.  <br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Drop toughness for knockdown, your final hitpoints won't change if you made the change I suggested above and you'll get a +1 to your fortitude save.  Knockdown is awesome, you get +4 against a prone opponent and while an opponent is prone he can't cast spells or attack you.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>11.

Blind Fight. <br>16. Cleric 11. +1 to Strength. <br>17. Cleric 12. <br>18. Cleric 13. Called Shot. <br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Change this to:<br>11.

Cleric 14. +1 to Strength. <br>17. Cleric 15. <br>18. Cleric 16. Great Cleave.<br><br>Take the other CoT levels in epic levels.  This way you pick up another +1 to fortitude and will saves, you lose one AB and an attack.  But you can get the attack back with Divine power and you'll get it at your max AB instead of at -15.  With the extra epic feat, take epic prowess.  You lost one strength, by changing the starting attributes, so drop one great strength for an epic fortitude.  Your final strength will be reduced by 1 but your AB won't be reduced because the epic prowess, this will net you a further +4 to fortitude.  I'll also echo, taking devastating critical as soon as possible.<br><br>So in total, from these changes, you would lose 1 AB, 1 point of damage and 1 from your Dev. Crit. DC and one attack at -15.  You would gain +6 to foritude, +1 to will and an attack at full AB when buffed.  This should make you more dev. crit. proof as well as make you immune to implosion clerics.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 07/20/06 21:55</span></i></p>

I too love the synergy of cot/cleric (see my elven priest build).  I like the way this build is done (as I too, in the past have liked my clerics to have 16+ab at 20), but I am finding the truth that leaving it at 15 (full cleric ab) at 20 IS much more beneficial (as has been suggested).  The ONLY real negative I've heard about this is "I dont want to rely on a short term buff for my ab".  Here's the thing with that, your cleric can really either be a caster OR a meleeist.  It is very hard to do BOTH in the same build (yes, you can get by as the opposite, but you really cant excel at both, this is testament to the power of the cleric class).  So, what this means is that at the low lvl slots, what a melee cleric should do is, after they have the EXTENDED buffs (or with this many cleric lvls, regulars), you add all the availables as divine favs and powers.  My cleric routinely has 18 favs (reg and extended) and about 6 d pwrs, and he is lv 20.  You get +10 ab!!  and it takes only a second.  remember, IF you get trouble, you can ALWAYS have Harms memd to get you out of that.<br><br>Sorry for the longness, but I just wanted to point out that a cleric doesnt need to have the 16+bab.  Especially with all the strength!   Take from this what you will, but its from a reformed 16+bab cleric lover <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/08/06 16:20:00 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I think avado answered your question like no other could... </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->
