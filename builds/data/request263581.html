How about Wiz 3 / Druid 10/ AA 27, and use Zen Archery.  Druid would grant you some nice enough buffs.<br><br>Your AC would take a hit (because of dex), but you'd get more Druid spells.<br><br>More druid levels for better buffs would work too.<br><br>But this changes the build around quite a bit, so probably not a good idea.<br><br>==========<br><br>If you take Assasin (would have to be evil) instead of Rogue you would get Ghostly Visage as a bonus spell.<br><br>and extra poison saves.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 01/16/07 20:46</span></i></p>

Epic Dodge is a must for any Dexer, and is well worth the 5 points of AB you will lose by adding 9 more rogue levels.  Your AB will still be above and beyond the "average" devoted meleer, and your damage will probably increase against anything vulnerable to sneaks, so long as you make lots of darkness wands and spam it all over the place <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    .<br><br>Other than that, first glance looks solid.<br>_________________<br>(I enjoy writing parenthetically (a lot)).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By koolthursday on 01/16/07 21:11</span></i></p>

Thanks for the replies; I like the Druid Idea, I may work that up for comparison if nothing else.<br><br>Thursday, thanks for the info; I'll play a bit and see about the epic dodge addition, but I am not sure I like the sacrifice honestly.  his buffs will be adequate to protect him if necessary I think; until he can Expeditiously retreat; invis and stealth back.<br><br>yes? no?  I need a few opinions here folks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>I'll build him both ways to compare regardless, thanks!<br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world

Have you used the pulse cap search engine tool to find the AA builds?<br><br>there are currently 111 of them.  I'm sure that there would be many ideas there.

I did yes, and none of them seemed to quite do what I was trying <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Closest was a rogue/wiz/AA that was very rogue heavy with a single level of wizard...

You can't make a high sneak with so little Rogue, I suggest 13 Rogue, which is the minimum to apply for Epic Dodge, and gives a much better 7d6 sneak attack.<br><br>However, if you want spells on it, it's much easier to use a Fighter / Wizard / Arcane Archer combination, since you only need 4 Fighter levels for EWS, though some more is best suited for BAB, and there is quite some space for Wizard levels and still get a high Enchant Arrow, simple, steady, and strong.<br><br>I'd also suggest more Wizard levels, I like it at 21 for Epic Warding... what's the point in taking just little buffs? take strong spells or don't waste class levels, several good buffs as GMW and Flame Weapon won't work on ranged, granted, Haste is cool but you might get it anyway on an item, Improved Invisibility might be one of your best buffs, and it is profitable, but more levels makes a longer duration too, so you might be stronger if you aim for something like Time Stop, Bigby's or Epic Spells, AAs with Time Stop are great as you can use the time to change the distance (say, run a bit) and leave a gap to cast a new one easily, plus the killing: a full round of no resistance.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 01/17/07 01:32</span></i></p>

The point of the build was the archer focus, not the sneak focus; but good points all thanks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Here is an update with Epic Dodge, though he is overall better I still am not sure I like the layout...  I really would rather go with ranger but I can't get a ranger/AA built for what I am trying (I dunno, I just can't get it to work the way I was hoping... )<br><br>Anyway, here he is;  I haven't checked for similarities since I changed it around, but i am headed that way...
