After reading the post about combining Sneak Attack &amp; Divine Might, I just had to make the build.<br><br>First I want to point out the fact Divine Might/Sneak Attack/Hide in Plain Sight combination works out great, for couple of reasons:<br><br>1. Sneak Attack/HIPS can easily finish ANYONE without true sight/immunity to criticals/high spot/listen.<br>2. Divine Might can only be nullified with anti-divine items, enabling you to kill undead (the most common imm. crit. creatures) and high DR opponents<br>3. Together the three allow you to deal great deals of damage, with only few ways to stop you.<br><br>The build:<br><br>Thurmion Trueknife AKA Divine Backstabber<br><br>Lawful Good - Elf<br><br>3-15 Pal/10 SD/15-27 Rogue<br><br>14<br>14<br>10<br>10<br>12 (+ 2 Feat if high Pal)<br>16 + 10<br><br>Start with Paladin. Take Power Attack as starting feat. Divine Might at lvl 3.<br><br>That's the only requirement for this build, as from there on it's totally up to you. You can either go with 27 Rogue (10 Shadowdancer at the first opportunity, thought) to maximize Sneak Attack, or you can go with varying levels of Paladin to maximize your combat proves and gain few spells to add weapon-enhancing spells. Level 15 proposed as by then Divine Favor is maximized. If you go with 15 Paladin, take 2 Great Wisdoms and Divine Shield (bear in mind that if you go with less than 15 or less Rogue levels you can't get any Improved Sneak Attack feats, as requirements are achieved only by then, so you have some open Epic feats.)<br><br>For feats, pick a weapon (choice is really only between high crit propability weapons and 2-handed weapons as shield only lowers your AC), SD requirements and Divine Might (of course). Epic feats should consist of as many Improved Sneak Attacks as possible.<br><br>10 Shadowdancer was taken to get the defensive feats &amp; to leave epic Rogue Bonus Feats for Sneak Attacks (as Improved Evasion and Slippery Mind would have been sure picks). You CAN drop 9 SD and go with 9 more rogue if you wish, as HIPS is the only NEEDED feat from SD.<br>_________________<br>"Lavamancers use three aspects of magic to make a golem: Transmutation; to mold the golem, Necromancery; to bind a soul to control the golem, and Evocation; to blast the damn thing on fire."<br>- Jushak Firestone - Grim Lavamancer<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 17:21</span></i></p>
