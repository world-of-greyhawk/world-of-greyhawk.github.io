Harm?  There is so much more to cleric than Div Power (though it is a nice feat).  Harm is Necromancy, so in order to maximize it, you need to take epic spell foci:necro.  <br><br>The thing though, necs really need Evocation too.  You are looking to do a Caster cleric, so you should look at taking ALOT of cleric (35ish).  You should start with wisdom 18, as it is the DC modifier for the cleric spells.  You need to take 10 stats and great wis 10 or so in order to max the DC.<br><br>Think, implode (evo).  For undeadies, Undead to death is very good necro.  Of course there are others.  For a caster, spellbook management is a must, so you MUST look at metamagic feats, extend, empower OR max, and silent spell (for extra harms and extra undead to death's etc). <br><br>It could be interesting to take COT ONLY in epic (as you shouldnt need melee feats at all (MAYBE zen archery, since wisdom will be thru the roof).  <br><br>in my honest opinion though, any server that NERFS div power is a sad server.  If i were you, id seriously consider finding a new home, cuz what else is nerfed?  You dont have to respond, just think about it.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/08/06 16:20:00 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I think avado answered your question like no other could... </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

It's probably just a remnant of an older server's rules from back in the Second Age of NWN when Divine Power was super-charged.  DM's probably just never got around to unnerfing it.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

If I remember correctly Harm requires a melee touch attack based off your AB with no weapon focuses vs dex modifier/dodge/deflection making a caster type cleric's harm a bit less effective against dex based opponents and those epic boss mobs..although I could be mistaken, clerics really aren't my thing.<br><br>Either way if I was mistaken sowwwwyyyy D:

Darn, avado, you really do loads of unnecessary stuff to use a spell that has no save at all. After getting the obvious 19 WIS, just take measures to boost your AB. Raising spell DCs in Necro (or anything else) won't help your harm, ryouko. Your AB will, though. Touch attacks are rarely hard to land with a cleric. You will need to do a little damage very quickly right after the Harm, either through a spell(whatever assures at least 4 damage, preferably negative) or through a standard melee attack. Or a bards curse song. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

LOL! First, he said he wanted Harm.  In my professional opinion, NEVER base a cleric on Harm!  It can be resisted, then what?  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">     My suggestions revolved around making an ALL AROUND cleric (i know, oxymoron), but still effective.<br><br>Now, you said you want to use a cleric for dispell?  For that, go with wiz or sorc!  Clerics lack Breech, which, in my experience with clerics, the finger wigglers are much more effective in taking away "stuff".  <br><br>Harm isnt really a spell to build around.  it should be a support spell (or Heal/mass heal for undeads).  Funny, me thought i talked all about this somewhere...  hmm.  WHere was that again?  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 03/03/09 08:10</span></i></p>

I have used it with a Cleric with 66AB and not had it work.  I have had it with a DC of 50 (i know) and it didnt work (both are from PRC rules, hence the stupid numbers cuz both were PURE divine casters, sorry 40 caster lvls).  Your guess is as good as mine, which is why my above recommendation stands!  LOL
