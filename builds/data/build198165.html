This is a DEX-based build with the intent of using Cleric buffs to augment damage and AB, while obtaining Epic Dodge to help out in survivability. It's a dual-wielder which I built with short swords as the weapons of choice.

13 is honestly a slightly odd cleric level to end at...The ideal level to stop at is 15, because that maxes out all of those "+1 every 3 levels, to a max of +5" spells.  15 levels of cleric would give you +2 to AB and damage (from Divine Favor and Greater Magic Weapon) and +1 to AC (Magical Vestment).  The only question is which other class to drop.  I would drop two levels of CoT.  You'll lose Armor Skin, but your picking up +1 AC anyway from GMW).  The other way you'll lose 1d6 sneak (Slippery Mind isn't much of a loss considering your will saves are very high for a rogue).<br><br>Anyway, just an idea.  It's a good build though.<br><br>Steve

Very nice.  This is an effective combo, and you use the CoT levels the way I like to use them.  I question the stat selection, though.  Cleric and Rogue combine for a great skill set.  I would consider a 17 Dex, and put 2 points immediately into Intelligence.  Or, leave Dex 18 and take two from Strength.   Maybe he gets a enough skill points already, I'm not sure.  But you obviously want Spellcraft, Concentration, Discipline, Tumble, Hide, Move Silently, and UMD maxed.  I can't add, so someone else will have to do the math.  And you still probably want a few to plug in the other utility skills.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Another possibility is to dump the extra points into Concentration and take Epic Skill Focus:Concentration to max it out - if it's available on the Rogue bonus feat list. If not, then max Concentration and leave one of the Rogue skills lower - perhaps UMD and then take the ESF bonus feat in that one). Probably the 2 Rogue would be easiest to drop though, since I'd rather have the EWF/EP and (to a lesser extent) Armor Skin.<br><br>The reason I took 13 CLC was just to get that last level in to max Spellcraft (It was either Cleric, Rogue, or CoT and Cleric was the best choice of the 3, IMHO). I hadn't really intended on the extra Cleric level - I was going to stop at 12 levels - but I just didn't see Rogue or CoT as better choices for that 40th left over level.<br><br>One thing I really like about the build is it's quite easy to adjust it to your personal taste and playing style. (You could adjust starting stats, feats, and even the levels of the classes by a couple without really affecting the overall integrity).<br><br>Anyway guys, thanks for the feedback.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Strength mainly for the Divine Power buff at levels 3 and 4 (as well as level 5 with the Silent Spell feat)<br>Trickery gives the Invis line of spells, ending with the excellent Improved Invis.<br><br>Final AB dual-wielding and unbuffed is: +38.<br><br>Buffed with Divine Power, it rises to +43 and gives you 3 attacks at your highest AB, 2 at your second highest (+38). You'll get even better AB by stacking more Cleric buffs on top of that.<br><br>Hit Points: Not a strong suit with this character, but you have Endurance/Empowered End. to get yourself a few more.<br><br>Unbuffed Saves (Spellcraft Bonus vs Spells):<br><br>FORT: 25 (33)<br>REF: 35 (43)<br>WILL: 26 (34)<br><br>Naked AC: 29<br><br>Final Stats:<br><br>STR 10<br>DEX 32<br>CON 12<br>INT 12<br>WIS 18<br>CHA 8<br><br>Skill points: total of 304<br>Skills (modified): <br><br>Hide: 41 (52)<br>Move: 41 (52)<br>Tumble: 40 (51*)<br>UMD: 41 (40)<br>Conc: 39 (40)<br>Spell: 39 (40)<br>Disc: 43<br><br>20 points left over for secondary skill concerns.<br>* No effect on AC for the extra points.<br><br><br>Spells: You get an extra slot due to WIS of levels 1,2,3, and 4 spells.<br> <br>Total spells:<br>Level 1: 7<br>Level 2: 7<br>Level 3: 7<br>Level 4: 6<br>Level 5: 5<br>Level 6: 4<br>Level 7: 3<br>Level 8: 2<br><br>Lots of slots, and lots of versatility with the couple of metamagic feats to fill up the spellbook with useful buffs.<br><br>Cast Ultravision and load up on Darkness spells to generate sneak attacks.<br><br>You get an excellent Darkfire boost on two weapons, Bull's STR to up your damage, all the good Cleric buffs to agument AB/damage, and a good number of spells per day.<br><br>Sneak attack is an acceptable 10d6.<br><br>Thanks to the different starting stats, I can get all the important skills maxed (or within a point or two), still get all the Cleric spells and take the all-important 15 levels, grab a few more HPs, still keep the DEX at 32, as well as retain almost all the feats I had originally. Thanks for the help and suggestions guys!<br><br>Thoughts?<br><br>*Edit* One thing to consider is moving the CLC 11 to level 25, so the next 3 levels look like this:<br><br>25)Cleric 11<br>26)Rogue 14<br>27)Rogue 15: Epic Weapon Focus <br><br>This will result in access to the level 6 spells/slots 2 levels earlier with no real adverse effects on the build (you delay 1d6 sneak attack by 1 level, but get your Tumble skill dump for the +1 AC a level sooner - worth the trade IMHO)<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 06/06/05 16:25</span></i></p>
