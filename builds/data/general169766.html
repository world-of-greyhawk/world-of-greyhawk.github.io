Hi,<br><br>When I was trying out some Bard/BG/X builds yesterday, I found myself at character creation with two stat points left over. Looking at Wisdom 8 and Dexterity 8, I wasn't sure where to put the last points.<br><br>If I leave Dex at 8 then my AC suffers by 1. But if I leave Wisdom at 8, then my will saving throws suffer by 1.<br><br>For a meleeing tank, where do you all think the two stat points should go and which stat should be left at 8?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban
