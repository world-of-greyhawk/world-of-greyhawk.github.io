Hey Guys just wated to say i love reading your builds. I am not very good myself at them but I am learning. I was just wandering if anyone knew an updated version of the exalted sorc for nwn2, or had one they would mind sharing. The rules for nwn2 are diff. Also was curious if the exalted sorc would be updated with going pure sorc as in nwn1 or if in nwn2 they would for for eldritch knight. I noticed in nwn1 paladins got char bonus to the spell resist with just one lvl in pally yet in nwn2 it requires 2 lvls in pally. Anyhow just rambling if anyone has an updated version of this it would be great.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By caveman_282 on 01/11/07 15:51</span></i></p>

That's a little hard to convert since nwn2 is not epic.<br><br>I'm sure that there are some very nice nwn2 builds in that Guild group.  You could also use Pulse Cap's search engine to find the builds.  His site has been updated (looks very nice).<br><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/news/index.php?" target="_blank">http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/news/index.php?</a>
