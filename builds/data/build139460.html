Just fyi, at least until the next patch, you can't perform devestating critical with a missle weapon.

Why did you take RDD to level 11? BTW I have a very similar build waiting on the next patch. Even without the dev crit it's nasty.

Nice build. I worked out one very similar on paper - turns out it's <i>exactly</i> like evo_dragon's! Great minds?<br>_________________<br>"Tis no man, 'tis a remorseless EATING machine..."

Thanx for all of your advice! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I didn't know about the Devastating Critical stuff, too bad it can't be used yet. I had made different versions though, in one of them I replaced the critical hit stuff for some two weapon fighting with weapon finesse, for some melee damage.<br><br>You are right on the 11th level of RDD, it's quite useless and better spend on an extra Bard level, I'll change it right away <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .

Hmm...I tried the improved build, it's better <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> , but I still have 35 AC, I already had the max from tumble if I'm correct. Also because of the RDD Intelligence bonus coming later I have less skill points to divide (I put less points in persuade to compensate). Still the extra attack and the +2 BAB is nice <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .
