Hi,<br>i made this build for a pw I play on which is very high magic and has no "truesight" as such. It is designed to be a sneaky unarmed fighter, as there are some very powerful monk gloves.

Why elf? I see you've got Dex 18 at character creation...but you're not going for Self Concealment...so why go elf? If you went human (or dwarf) you wouldn't have to worry about an experience penalty. And you'd get a bonus feat at character creation.<br><br>If you want to be sneaky, have you looked at taking fewer fighter levels pre-epic and then taking 10 levels of ShadowDancer in epic? You get lots of great feats for free with 10 levels of SD.<br><br>Maybe end up F 10/M 20/SD 10  or F 12/M 18/SD 10?<br><br>I'm just tossing some ideas out. No guarantee that they're good ideas <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br><br>Kaliban

thanks for the reply. I mainly went elf cause of roleplaying but also cause of the passive spot/listen bonus. I guess the  build would work with most races even halfling.

FIghters only get feats on even numbered levels, so you would not get a feat at level 17, so that level would be a waste<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By realm of shadow on 11/30/04 21:17</span></i></p>

Ont he note of fighters and feat levels, I'd offer going to a 15 fighter/20 monk/5 shadowdancer, or a 14 fighter/21 monk/5 shadowdancer. This would give you perfect self which is probably worth more than what one of your fighter feats gives. It looks like you have extras anyways with the ones you flagged as optional. The thing with this build and an odd level of fighter, is taking one level of fighter and adding it to any of the other two classes is equally as useless, so might as well ge the extra 2 hp.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Why so much Dex if you don't want SC?  Taking Epic Prowess and Armor Skin instead of two Great Dex feats would net you another AC, at the loss of a reflex save and a couple of skill bonuses.  A good trade, in my opinion.<br><br>Also, trading two levels of fighter pre-epic for 2 more monk levels is definitely a good idea.  You gain:  +1 AC, +2 SR, Perfect Self.  You lose:  1 BAB, 1 feat, four HP.  Since you have more feats than you know what to do with pre-epic, and the BAB won't lose you an attack, I think it's a good trade.<br>_________________<br>Epic Character Builders:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

My advice would be to go for Monk 25 / Fighter 10 / SD 5. pre-epic, I notice you're not taking Monk levels til late on, but plan to fight unarmed from the very beginning. what? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">  You'll be doing 1d3 - 1 damage! Plus, every time you attack, your enemy will get an attack of opportunity against you. You need to take level 1 as a Monk level, so you can at least get 1d6 damage from your fists and Improved Unarmed Strike, which removes the attack of opportunity issues. It also gets you some more skills.<br><br>Plus, you're going Elf, and have put points into Charisma. From a powergaming point of view, this is all wrong. The best race for a Monk, multiclassed with Fighter especially, is Dwarf, because it nerfs a pointless stat (Cha) in favour of a really useful one (Con). Fighter is a dwarf's favoured class, so no experience penalty here either. if you go for a Dwarf, you can get the following starting stats:<br>Str 12<br>Dex 16<br>Con 16<br>Int 14<br>Wis 12<br>Cha 6<br>which gets you more +1 to damage rolls instead of -1, an extra hit point per level, at the cost of -1 to AC and AB, and -1 to skill rolls for skills which use Cha. Worthwhile tradeoff IMO.<br><br>Pre-epic, go Monk 12 / Fighter 8, you'll get 5 bonus feats. I wouldn't bother with Whirlwind Attack unless yo get either WM levels or Improved Whirlwind Attack, so get rid of Expertise and Spring Attack, but Luck of Heroes, Called Shot and Improved Disarm are all worthwhile. You'll get a BAB of 17 at level 20 this way, a little bit lower, but it's worth it for the improvements to the saving throws and it will be easier to level this way too, as you'll get a better unarmed attack damage die, more speed, more Monk AC bonus and more ranks in Tumble.<br><br>Post-epic, take another two Fighter levels for another feat, which you can spend on Epic Weapon Specialisation. Taking Monk to 25 gets you Empty Body (50% concealment \o/ <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  ), Perfect Self, more SR and an epic bonus feat, which you can use for Armour Skin. These are the epic feats I think you should take:<br>Epic Weapon Focus<br>Epic Weapon Specialization<br>Epic Dodge<br>Armour Skin<br>Epic Prowess<br>Great Dex 4<br>which accounts for all nine of the epic feats this character would get.
