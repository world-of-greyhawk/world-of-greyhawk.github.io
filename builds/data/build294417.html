Forest Sniper: Ranger(26), Wizard(4), Arcane Archer(10)<br><br>He had been patrolling the borders of the forest for over a century protecting his home land.  As he watched the enemy approach he reflected on the training it took to get this position.  Not everyone one could do this.   The combination of archery and magic was difficult.  That was why there were so few of his colleagues, but they were enough to allow for only a small active military.  What few enemies could get past the Forest Snipers could easily be dealt with.  With their ability to accurately take out the leaders from such a long distance and do tremendous damage to the rest of the force stopped most invaders in their tracks.  That was why after a quick assessment he knew he didn’t need the help of his fellows for this group although they far outnumbered him.  As the enemy drew close he spotted the leader and took aim…<br><br>A few words first about this build.  First, this is a build for a specific server with a minimum four levels per class so he needs four levels in an arcane class.  Which class is up for comment, less than four levels is not up for comment.  Secondly, I chose Wizard for the familiar and access to Ultravision and Darkness spells, but please give comments regarding this choice.  Third, I waited for epic levels to take Wizard so I could get full BAB, but once again please comment as to my choice.<br><br>Similar builds:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "119179", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>No Name</a><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "244733", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> The Devastating Bowman</a><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "205934", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Banebow</a><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "231851", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Hunter</a><br><br>Race: Elf<br>Alignment: Any<br>PvM or PvP depending on your choice of Favored Enemies<br>Playable 1-40 (Any DEX character has a slow start but it can be done)<br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 18 (30)<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Elf: (Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Keen Sense, Low-light Vision, Skill Affinity: Listen, Skill Affinity: Search, Skill Affinity: Spot, Sleeplessness)<br>01: Ranger(1): Weapon Focus: Longbow, Favored Enemy I, {Dual Wield, Trackless Step}<br>02: Ranger(2)<br>03: Ranger(3): Point Blank Shot<br>04: Ranger(4): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br>05: Ranger(5): Favored Enemy II<br>06: Ranger(6): Weapon Finesse, {Animal Companion}<br>07: Ranger(7)<br>08: Ranger(8): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>09: Ranger(9): Rapid Shot, {Improved Two-Weapon Fighting}<br>10: Ranger(10): Favored Enemy III<br>11: Ranger(11)<br>12: Ranger(12): DEX+1, Blind Fight, (DEX=21)<br>13: Ranger(13)<br>14: Ranger(14)<br>15: Ranger(15): Weapon Focus: Shortsword, Favored Enemy IV<br>16: Ranger(16): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>17: Ranger(17)<br>18: Ranger(18): Improved Critical: Longbow<br>19: Ranger(19)<br>20: Ranger(20): DEX+1, Favored Enemy V, (DEX=23)<br>21: Ranger(21): Armor Skin<br>22: Wizard(1): {Summon Familiar, Scribe Scroll}<br>23: Ranger(22)<br>24: Ranger(23): DEX+1, Bane of Enemies, Favored Enemy VI, (DEX=24)<br>25: Arcane Archer(1): {Enchant Arrow I}<br>26: Arcane Archer(2): {Imbue Arrow}<br>27: Wizard(2): Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>28: Ranger(24): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br>29: Arcane Archer(3): {Enchant Arrow II}<br>30: Arcane Archer(4): Epic Prowess, {Seeker Arrow I}<br>31: Wizard(3)<br>32: Ranger(25): DEX+1, Favored Enemy VII, (DEX=26)<br>33: Arcane Archer(5): Epic Weapon Focus: Shortsword, {Enchant Arrow III}<br>34: Arcane Archer(6): {Seeker Arrow II}<br>35: Wizard(4)<br>36: Arcane Archer(7): DEX+1, Great Dexterity I, {Enchant Arrow IV}, (DEX=28)<br>37: Arcane Archer(8): {Hail of Arrows}<br>38: Arcane Archer(9): {Enchant Arrow V}<br>39: Ranger(26): Great Dexterity II, Favored Enemy VIII, (DEX=29)<br>40: Arcane Archer(10): DEX+1, {Death Arrow}, (DEX=30)<br><br>Hitpoints: 396<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 23/18/26<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2<br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 44 (melee), 49 (ranged)<br>Mundane Longbow: 49/44/39/34 at 1d8 +5 or 51/46/41/36 +5 +6+2d6 vs. Favored Enemies.

The thing I wonder is, why 4 wiz lvls?  Is there a change to AA that I am not aware of?  <br><br>See, it is nice and all to have ranger spells (though i have never seen much value in them) so I can live with 14 wisdom.  It is the 14 int i am unsure of.  30 dex, while adequate for a dex cleric, seems low for an elf bower.  (for those of you who dont understand that statement, my meaning is that it is HARD to have the stats to get dex to 30 and wis to 19 in same build, NOT impossible, just hard, while an elf should get 30 without trying).<br><br>Other than that it is a nice build.  A few years ago, i was into making chars with classes that were unusual (monk with non kama wpn, for example).  I wonder what an AA melee focused character would be like..... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>Well, I think it's good, you're taking advantage that Rangers dual-wield and use shortswords, it's ok if you really need melee, but I wouldn't really use it since the bow gets both higher AB and damage, just 1 APR less won't make your melee hit harder.

Yes, the idea behind the dual wield was so he could handle himself when ranged attacks quit working, ie. when enemies got too close.  Thanks for all the responses people.
