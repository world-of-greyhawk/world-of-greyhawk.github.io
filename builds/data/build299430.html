This quick and cunning charmer is a lethal mix of knives and evil.  Able to launch 6 attacks per round, he can not only bring 13d6 sneak per blade, but Epic Weapon Specialization and Divine Damage into each thrust as well.  Supported by Epic Dodge, the ability to set, disarm and recover Deadly Traps, UMD scrolls, wands and Monk gear, and to unhinge his opponents with a 47 Taunt score, the Halfling Blade Runner is as versatile as he is sly, and has a weapon for every situation.  <br><br><b>The Blade Runner</b><br><br>Rogue21/Fighter12/Blackguard7<br>Race: Halfling<br>Alignment: Any Evil<br>Playable: 1-40, Low to Mid Magic PvM<br><br><b>Attributes</b><br>Str13<br>Int12<br>Wis8<br>Dex18 (28)<br>Con10<br>Chr14 (20)<br><br><b>Level Guide</b><br>1 Rogue1, Ambidexterity<br>2 Fighter1, Weapon Finesse<br>3 Fighter2, WF: Daggers, 2-Weapon Fighting<br>4 Fighter3, Dex19<br>5 Fighter4, WS: Daggers<br>6 Rogue2, Power Attack<br>7 Rogue3<br>8 Rogue4, Dex20<br>9 Rogue5, Cleave<br>10 Blackguard1<br>11 Blackguard2<br>12 Blackguard3, Divine Might, Dex21<br>13 Rogue6<br>14 Fighter5<br>15 Fighter6, ITWF, Blindfighting<br>16 Fighter7 Dex22<br>17 Rogue7<br>18 Blackguard4, Divine Shield*<br>19 Rogue8<br>20 Blackguard5, Dex23<br>21 Rogue9, Great Dex I<br>22 Rogue10, Improved Evasion<br>23 Rogue11<br>24 Rogue12, Great Dex II, Dex26<br>25 Rogue13, Defensive Roll<br>26 Rogue14<br>27 Rogue15, Great Chr I<br>28 Rogue16, Epic Dodge, Chr16<br>29 Fighter8, EWF: Daggers<br>30 Fighter9, EWS: Daggers<br>31 Fighter10, Epic Prowess<br>32 Rogue17, Chr17<br>33 Blackguard6, Great Chr I<br>34 Fighter11<br>35 Fighter12, Armor Skin<br>36 Rogue18, Great Chr II, Chr20<br>37 Rogue19, Crippling Strike*<br>38 Rogue20<br>39 Blackguard7, Great Dex III<br>40 Rogue21, Dex28<br>*<i>indicates you can substitute for other feats if desired</i><br><br><b>Combat Vitals</b><br>AB: 42/37/32/27<br>Dualwielding: 40/35/30/25/40/35<br>Damage: 1d4+7+13d6sneak+ 5-11 Divine + Crippling Strike<br>Sling AB: 40/35/30/25<br>Naked AC: 30<br>HP: 316<br><br><b>Saves:</b><br>Fort 27<br>Will: 20<br>Reflex: 34<br><br><b>Skills:</b> 281<br>Tumble: 40<br>Hide: 42 (55)<br>Move Silently: 40 (51)<br>UMD: 30 (35)<br>Taunt: 42 (47)<br>Search: 13 (14)<br>Set Traps: 25 (36)<br>Disable Traps: 29 (32)<br>Open Lock: 20 (29)<br><br><b>Strengths</b><br>Epic Dodge<br>Versatile Damage Output<br>Divine Damage allows him to deal with Undead and Sneak-Immune enemies<br>Great Skill Set<br>Decent Saves<br>Good AC<br>Can Stack Bulls Strength Potion with Spell/Potion<br>Lower enemy AC with Taunt<br><br><b>Weaknesses</b><br>Low Hit Points<br>No KD feats<br>Must generate sneaks the old-fashioned way<br><br><b>Notes:</b>  There was only one Halfling Fighter/Rogue/Blackguard in the guild (a crying shame that is), and he was a dart thrower: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "146904", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Master Thrower (FTR 14 / Rogue 13 / BG 13)</a> by Kreestopearq, and his sole purpose was to do nifty damage with Darts.  The two builds also differ in that The Blade Runner gets a slightly higher Dex and Chr score, and also goes much deeper into the Rogue class.  <br><br>There were a few other Ftr/Rogue/Bg combos, but not many, and they were all strength-based critters.  I actually was pleased at how this one turned out.  It is able to do that one thing that many Dexers have difficulty with, and that’s finding a way to damage sneak-immune opponents.  He can stand and deliver divine projectiles afar with a sling, mine the battlefield, deliver decent sneak from the shadows, and, if needed go toe-to-toe in combat with Epic Dodge to give him the edge.  I chose Crippling Strike near the end of the build because it looks sexy, but it’s not vital to the build, and can easily be substituted for Slippery Mind or an Epic Skill Focus.  I didn’t bother with Discipline in this build, and quite frankly, he couldn’t afford it without dropping starting Dex, but I don’t think it’s worth it.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

An interesting build Grizz. I haven't much input on it as you do your builds extremely well and you seem to have nailed exactly what you wanted in it. Nice to see you've still got something in the tank.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I like the way you use charisma here: Better saves, better damage output and a boost to important skills. <br>And you can afford the luxury of charisma in a sneaker with +42AB (I figure that number must include the size bonus).<br>I also like the versatility of the build.<br>And I like the Daggers <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

Well done Dwarflord, nice build. I really lik eitThe lack of KD/IKD is not a big issue, I played more than one halfling sneaker without that option and they were able to handle the situation. <br><br>HPs are lowish, but there's not much one can do but go DEX 17, STR 12, CON 14 starting and drop one DEX increase for a STR one and end at DEX 26 (and STR 13) trading +1 AB/AC/Ref save for +40 HPs and +1 Fort save. I'm not sure it's worth it.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die
