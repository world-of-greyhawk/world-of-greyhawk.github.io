Hiya all <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> ..<br><br> Im running a guild on my PW that Allows ONLY Ranger-Druid-Shifter-Monk-rogue-SD. The Whole theme as you can probably guess is based around the Wilderness, and more specifically Diana, Goddess of the Hunt.<br><br> The majority of Lv's HAVE to be in druid, Ranger OR shifter. <br><br> Ok. Im working on a VIABLE Dragonshape build JUST using these classes, and i have fleshed out a few build. Id love some feedback on them from you clever people. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br> PvP is mostly Vs's Mages and High Dex Monk-SD's, Monk-Clerics or Rogue-WM's. <br>So Mostly i Buff, Shift and end up getting Mord'd from scrolls or Spells. So the build has to work to a resonable degree un-buffed. Epic Fire restistance is also handy Vs Elemental shield. (i tend to fight in Green Dragon form Vs mages as acid shealth is just as nasty <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  )<br> Against almost everything BUT huge AC builds i seem to kick butt, Mages is 50-50 IF i can get a KD landed and make it stick..Against High Ac builds i have SERIOUS trouble getting past Epic dodge and Concealment 50% and i hardly land a single hit. (Blind fight and True seeing DONT seem to be helping much...SHOULDNT True seeing cancel their concealment??)<br><br> <br> 1) Ranger 21 (for Bane),Monk1,Druid 18..<br><br> Ranger Pre Epic for the AB increase, the Dual wielding is also a hand bi-product that allows you to Dual wield Kama's while in Human form..Ive had alot off success with this so Far, but the saves are a little low (dev critical is allowed on the server) and i have to waste two good feats getting Imp KD.<br> No Ki strike hurts a little (Should be fine after the Patch <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  ), and feats are to streatched to get Expertise. The HP's are good considering, and Vs Mages i have a 50%-50% rate, maybe more in my favour so far. If i can keep em KD'd its plain sailing, and i have enough HP to survive a TS and Isaacs after.<br><br> *(This is the build im currently using, But im looking to either tweak it, OR try out a different build.)<br><br> 2) Druid 24,Ranger10,Monk 6..<br><br> Im in the middle of testing this at the moment, Pre-Epic its Ranger 5,Druid 11, Monk 4. Just enough for 4 attacks a round. The extra Druid Lv's are mostly there to get a Bonus feat and access to Hellball. (Which is a blessing in PvP Vs Dex build's ( i have problems hitting due to their HUGE Ab) The freed up feats from getting KD for free allow me to get Imp Expertise.<br><br> 3) Monk25,Druid 14,SD 1..<br> <br>  Low Ab but Hips is nice. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Im still working on this one..It was mainly to get Kia strike +5, immunity to mind spells, Empty body and a HUGE speed boost in dragon form.<br> <br><br>Feats Id like to get from Monk levels or by buying them. Imp KD (for the +ab bonus), Call Shot (Leg shot works great Vs High Dex builds, If u can land it.) Imp Expertise (Ive found Vs High dex characters i need the extra AC, and i seem to need 20's to hit them NOT using it alot of the time, And Vs High STR characters the extra AC keeps em off and the lowering of Ab doesnt hurt as much as i thought it would.) Blind Fight (As Concealment is a Nightmare to fight against.)<br><br> Buggy Dragonshape stuff..Every now and again i LOSE True seeing on my server for no apparent reason, i know ALL stat's you gain from equipment dissapear when the server saves, but im NOT sure why this happens with true seeing. It seems to vanish till i unshift and shift back. Also, Dying in Dragonshape means you have to remove ALL your equipment and put it back on, as ALL stat increases vanish. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br>This is Rough (and from memory, so excuse and mistakes) as im at work right now, ill post more details when i get home.<br><br>Druid24,Monk6,Ranger10 (for the other builds the feats dont vary to much, Apart from losing Hellball, and the Bonus feat, and taking Bane in the Lv21 ranger Version.)<br>Race-Human<br>Stats-<br><br>START		END<br>STR-10		10<br>DEX-10		10<br>CON-12		12<br>INT-14		14<br>WIS-18		31<br>CHR-8		8<br><br>Bump Wis every chance.<br><br>Level Progression.<br>*5 Ranger<br>*4 Monk<br>*11 Druid<br>*1 Monk<br>*1 Ranger<br>*11 Druid<br>*1 Ranger<br>*1 Druid<br>*1 Ranger<br>*1 Druid<br>*2 Ranger<br>*1 Monk<br><br><br>Feats <br>1 WF- Unarmed strike<br>1 blind fight<br>3 Expertise<br>6 Imp_Expertise<br>9 Called Shot<br>12 Extend Spell<br>15 Maxamise spell<br>18 Imp Critical-Unarmed strike<br>21 Great Wisdom I<br>24 Great Wisdom II<br>27 Great Wisdom III<br>30 Fire resistance<br>33 Fire restistance II<br>36 Epic Spell-HellBall<br>37 (Druid Bonus Feat) DragonShape<br>39 Toughness<br><br>(3 Favoured enemies- (Human-Halflings-Elves) <br><br>Skill points..(off hand)<br><br>Max Tumble, Discipline, Hide, Move silently.<br>As much in Spell craft as you can.<br><br>Rest spend as you see fit.  <br><br> **This is very much a work in progress and id REALLY love some help tweaking and tuning it a little more within my guild restrictions.<br>_________________<br><b>TO NAT.</b>I <b>love</b> you not only for what you are, but for what I am when I am with you.

I made a Shape Shifter once.  He was 21 monk..and...um *is not currently at his computer so he can not even check*.  It had the minimume Shifter to get all the shapes and 21 monk.<br><br>If you are allowed resistence on the server though, the build would not work at all because of the no weapon thing.<br><br>The main idea was to have 1d20 hands with a large number of attacks per round with really high strength.<br><br>Your base stats should focus only on Wisdom Int and Cha.  The other stats do not matter when you transform, so leave them at 8, or raise them to 10, but do not worry about them much.<br><br>The build would also be easier to RP since you would avoid the 1 level stuff many people do just for powergaming reasons (I try to avoid that).<br><br>Also, you would have 150% movement before haste and immunity to mind effects (as well as the other monk goodies).<br><br>Hope that helps some,<br>kip

I play on the CEP Nexus (In ACTION) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Before that Amon for a year..(i left when the uber equipment started getting WAY out of hand.)<br><br> I was hoping for a bit more help.. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  Anyway..<br><br> The ONLY problem the Monk6-Ranger9-Druid 25 build has right now is it serious problems fighting against High Dex builds-Or builds with access to Imp Invis or Concealment.

Would this build be what you are looking for?<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117044", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Leviathan the Dragon</a><br><br>It follows the rule that is on the server you are on. It has druid/monk/SD in the build. It can easily hide, although it can be beaten by anyone that has more than 65 skill in listen or spot skill. Also, for the attack, I am not exactly sure about that, but it should be pretty strong when fighting against certain builds, I haven't throughly tested this.<br><br>Hopefully this is what you are looking for.<br><br>Also, if the server allowed another classes, you could easily stand up against other (I am referring to cdaulepp's dragon build that he did).<br><br>Anuis

To have dragon shape, you need to have at least 14 levels of druid I think. So you can take 11 levels and put it into monk.<br><br>However, when you take dragon form, you have free feats from the monk class that works with dragon form(knockdown, etc). So by taking more levels in monk will get you more free feats and better speed. And the dragon shape (there are several others as well, but available in shifter class) will allow you to see any concealed creatures(true seeing).<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br> Im seriously thinking about going Shifter-Monk-Druid, for access to more forms, although would these really help in the situations i have trouble in??<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>If you take shifter class, there are certain builds that might can stand up to any form of hit, such as magical, critical, etc etc. I believe that would be the one that has Construct shape in it(forgot the name for that one...).
