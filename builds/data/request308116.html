I've been trying to think of a build that would be alo of fun to play and looking at the bonuses of the classes.<br><br>How would a bard, pale master, weapon master work?<br><br>what i was thinking is i dont care for dev crit. I thought it would be fun to be crit imune while being able to dish out lots of crits yourself. <br><br>can anyone lay out a build that has at least 10 PM levels and at least 7 wm levels?

Haven't done any calculus, but I'd actually put my money on Bard23/WM7/PM10.

LMAO!  That's what happens when you have a child kickin the keyboard.  More important than that, it would be even better if it were true!  *slips into dreaming of the cleric/rdd/pm... oh the power!*

A few levels of bard can add to almost any class combo by way of skill-set (discipline, spellcraft, UMD, tumble) buffs and a middling AB. A high level bard is versatile enough to solo most modules and PWs as well as providing massive and largely undispellable party support.<br><br>Oh, and bards qualify for the two most broken (OP) prestige classes in the game. There are more people playing super-strong, high HP devcritting scimmy-wielding bard/rdd/palemasters than you could organize a large-scale pogrom to exterminate.
