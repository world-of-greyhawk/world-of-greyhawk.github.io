I've been always multiclassing stuff with Monks, and recently made a Monk/Bard with only 1 level of Monk to get only the benefits of non-arcane trouble armor, cleave and more attacks per round using kama (it's a pain to make the alignment shift).<br><br>I have no real knowledge about the usefulness of a Bard, is this a good build or just a crazy one? what abilities can a Bard add to a Monk/possibly something else?

Thanks, although i was looking more on a melee without shapeshift, I already got a shifter for it.<br><br>What I really need to know is the advantages a Bard class gives (besides allowing you to get to RDD), since the song looks weak to me.<br><br>I might add this build, but I still need some information about the Bard's pros, looks like nobody has tried the alignment change I used here.

What do you think of a "Monk 1/Bard 29/Red Dragon Disciple 10"? it would fight quite well with all bard spells and some epic....

That's the same bard song you seem to despise. Bard song is far from weak. It's undispellable and coupled with curse song it's twice as effective. You get boni to AB, AC, HP, skills, saves and mali of the same quantity as your boni get applied to your enemies.<br>From one lvl 20 bard song+curse song you get +7 AC (+2AB you -5AC enemy), +7 AB (-2AB enemy, +5 AC you), +3 dmg per hit, -3 dmg per hit vs you, +28 hp, -28 hp for each of your enemies within range, +3 will/+2 fort and ref saves for you, same but negative for your enemies, +8 skills, -8 for your enemies (nice when using taunt). And if you've got LI it lasts 100 rounds. <br><br>All the other benefits of the bard have been clearly expressed by our finnish scholar. Let me mention that bard is useful also to give access to those PrCs which require arcane spellcasting as a prerequisite (AA, PM)<br><br>As for the build I'd go for 6 monk lvls at least KD/IKD for free is always nice, not to mention monk's endurance, still mind and purity of body and boni to AC if you're going the dex route. Bard 8/RDD 8/Monk 4 preepic. With no 1/1 BAB classes you won't get the full attack schedule though. And if alignment changes are an issue the build becomes a pain.<br><br>What do you mean with "some epic"?  If you mean epic spells I'm sorry to inform you bards do not get any.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 02/07/06 20:28</span></i></p>

Yeah, I forgot bards don't get to cast level 9 spells, thus, no epic spells.<br><br>Now that's more like it, that's an explanation I can refer to, just one more thing, I generally think the curse song makes me lose more effective melee killing time if I'm not fighting against really large groups, is this true or I'm getting it wrong?

The first thing I thought when I saw this was.. uber high AC monk 20 bard 20 with curse song, taunt to reduce opponent AC, lasting inspiration.. the works. Other features include: Wounding Whispers being castable in battle and the fallback of ice storms if you're in lots of moo<br><br>-DaMouse

Plus Bards can cast Invis/Imp Invis and sing their songs without becoming visible.<br><br>Yeah, that's right, a 30th level bard can cause 48hp sonic damage to everyone in a large radius without every becoming visible.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> <br><br>I call it Bardic Terrorism.
