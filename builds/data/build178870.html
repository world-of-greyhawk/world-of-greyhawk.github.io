I like this build very much, very iconic IMO.<br>But i was wondering why you haven't maxed out Hide and MS?

Yeah, why not drop 2 wisdom in exchange for 2 int. You could max UMD and hide/ms with the 40 extra skill points. That would be well worth the point of AC.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

Instead of putting skill points in heal, put the extra 10's into H and MS and max them.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Blunkanthrust on 02/03/05 16:52</span></i></p>

Sounds liek something I'd like to try... any ideas on how to raise that ac though?  on the world I play, an ac of 60 OR good soaking ability is required to survive in the medium-hard areas... higher is better though.

9Why not got monk 6/rogue 18/blackguard 16.<br><br>This way you can get epic dodge in and make good use of your high dex. It fills the same roll roleplaywise gives you 72 more skill points ,the same sneak attack. You lose the death attack (IMO not a biggie) considering it only applies inthe first flurry of combat (1 or 2 hits max). It would lose the arcane spells , but then thats what UMD is for.<br><br>Syrath

Syrath, I agree that Rogue would be better.  The thing was, I was trying to find a decent use for the Assassin class.  Although it's arguably not the best class, the same could be said about Blackguard. <br><br> If you really wanted to create something Uber, I would probably go Rogue 28/Monk 6/Fighter 6, or Rogue 23/Monk 9/Fighter 8, or something along those lines.  That would not only get you a ton more skill credits, it would also get you Epic Weapon Spec and Epic Dodge and either Skill Mastery or Crippling Strike.  <br><br>If you took Improved Sneak Attack feats at Rogue levels 16, 19, and 23 you could still get up to 15d6 sneak attacks, so I don't think there's any question that it would be a better build.<br><br>Still, this build was meant to be iconic more than anything else, so it's OK if it isn't super Uber.

NP, Its just that IMO its either all or nothing with assassin. ie just below 30 levels or not at all to make assassin worthwhile (gets a much longer duration on the 1 use arcane spells and a higher death attack save, making it much more useful)<br><br>Syrath
