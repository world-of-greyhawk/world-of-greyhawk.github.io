Hello,<br><br>I currently have a sorcerer level 16. First time I play a sorcerer and notice that the strategy of what spell to take is at the "levelup". I usually play a mage and there is quite a good difference. More higher you go more attention you have to take on what spell to choose.<br><br>Ex. Greater stoneskin and Premonition, I do not believe the effect stack. So I could remove one of them.<br><br>Here is my question:<br>What will be a good selection of spell of spell for a sorcerer who can work alone, but most of the time work in party (because of that do not do alots of close combat) ?<br><br>- greyhat<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By greyhats on 03/18/05 14:35</span></i></p>

If possible Id nearly always take timestop as one of my level 9 sorc spells, just because sometimes g'sanc isnt enough (due to the bugs with g sanc and imp invis) and it allows a few seconds of rebuffing time, or a window to unleash a hail of maxed/empowered igms and or horrid wiltings.

Timestop is ok... though a sorcerer has only three spells at lvl9.  To be honest, these should be three of (just imho, mind):<br>*Bigby's Crushing Hand<br>*Mordenkainen's Disjunction [believe it, you're gonna need if if up against a monk/cleric hybrid - or even pure monk].  Up against a casting class, no contest this should be in your collection.<br>*Wail of the Banshee [sorcerers can make GOOD spam-wailers, depending on immunities on your server/module]<br>*Black Blade of Disaster, if modified to be non dev-critting<br>Also, 9 seconds is not really that much of a timeboost - and most pw's modify it simply because it causes problems.
