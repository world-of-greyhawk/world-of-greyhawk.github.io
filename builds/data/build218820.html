I've never done a Dwarven Waraxe wielder and was quite shocked to find out that it doesn't trigger the nice 'feature' of CoT to take Epic Wpn Spec. Thus the need for 6 Fighter levels, instead of my planned 4 (all pre-epic, mostly to obtain Weapon Specialization). I reported this oddity to Encylopedia Brown (Cinnabar Din) and was even more shocked to find that he didn't know about this anomaly! But to restore his reputation, he whipped up a test build and confirmed that CoT can not get Epic Weapon Spec in Dwarven Waraxe. Odd, yes? But true.

Nice build Kal. I like it - and the dual-wielded Dwarven Axes has a certain... panache, no?<br><br>About the exotics: I tested as well with Katana and Scythe and was able to take EWS on CoT levels for them.

Couldn't you still manage to get WS/EWS with 4 fighter levels? You can take both with fighter 4 in epic but that would mean juggling your feats around a bit. You'd get the other +2 to saves from CoT.

Nice work, Kaliban.  The build is solid, but more importantly the sheer wickedness of dual-wielding Dwarven War Axes nets you huge style points.  <br><br>--<br>The Dwarven War council wagged their beards in agreement---sending their War Priest into battle would assure that the duergar uprising was quelled.<br>--  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br>_________________<br>Favorite PW's: Hall of the Worlds, Higher Ground, World of Iniquity.

It is good. But your AB dualwielding is so low that you will need to have at least some buffs at all time. But you get both high wisdom and good strength. When you face opponents fully buffed and dual wielding I can only imagine the damage you dish out.<br><br>Nice build.
