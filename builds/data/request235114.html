I want a spellsword type build.  I need high AC and a decent AB (30 or so should be fine). Preferably have cleric able to cast 7th level spells.  I would like one that does NOT duel wield kama's or have any monk in it cause I am sick of that build.  I was thinking something along the lines of a nasty little dwarf.  Perhaps a fighter/WM/Cleric or something of the sort.  I need to be able to solo most of the time.<br><br><br>Thanks

Well let me rephrase my post.  I just need a magic + melee build what ever you want to call it haha <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    Those are some good builds you listed but I do not need Dev crit, I like the ranger cleric wm but it doesn't progress the cleric until epic levels!! <br>On the server I play after you pass epic is it almost impossible to continue to play solo unless you have access to flame, imp invis, and other buffs.  So I guess I should have been more specific in my request.  My appoligies I am new to this forum.<br>How about a Sorc type build what would you recomend?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By drumnbassjunkie on 03/27/06 16:27</span></i></p>

Haha I been using the searches and just can't find one that I like or that I have not used.  Guess I am gonna have to actually cook my fish mate.  I will start to make my own once I fix my damned comp.  Thanks for the quick responses though I appreciate that my friend.  I have been playin with a Cleric21/Fighter12/WM 7 seems to be workin so far I will post final results once I test it.  <br><br><br>Also have a few questions; Does weapon finess on a dex build add points to damage modifier or is it just the AB?  Whats the most attacks per round you can get? And final dumb question I have is in your opinion what is the best solo build for a duel wielding one that can support himself almost anywhere?

This doesn't have the Crit range or raw AB of the Cleric-Weaponmasters builds, but I found it to be pretty effective for a low magic PW.

I think a shifter + shadow dancer mix would be cool.  If they didn't nerf HIPS on your server.<br><br>Undead are notorious for having week Fort saves, and I like to stone them up.  After you make your statues, I tend to flame them up with whyrmling breath.  No AB need.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>HIPS, shift, stone stone stone, hips, re-shift, stone stone stone, wash rince repeat.<br><br>or HIPS, Manticore Spikes, hips, manticore spikes, etc...<br><br>Shifters have a bad BAB to begin with, so taking 1 lvl of SD pre-epic will be more usefull than loosing that one point of AB.<br><br>If you do decide to go shifter (my fav class) just remember not to take weapon focus unarmed since it won't help.<br><br>Take improved initiative instead.

You guys have been a big help and also have given me my first idea for my own build.  I cannot say yet but it is in the works.  I tried a few of these builds in a testing server and most are effective.  I am currently running the Professional Rogue/Wiz/CoT with much success in my server which by the way is the best RP/PWG server around LaLaLand.   I would reccomend that if you like a challenge that you go play there. <br><br>Oh but you wait and see this build is gonna be good and original. Hehe thanks again.

Rather than ask my question and dirty up someone else's post I figured I would do it here.  At what point to your buffs become undispellable?? I have heard lots of talk about it and I do not know what makes this happen really.  It is a certain DC vs spells or is it the caster level.  I am really glad bioware made a good manual so you can referance these types of things haha.

Your spells are undispellable once you reach 25 caster levels.<br><br>The formula for dispelling is (this is with best case scenario using Grtr Dispel, which is the strongest of the Dispel line of spells)***:<br><br>(1d20 + 15) vs (Caster level of effect you're trying to dispel + 11).<br><br>The highest possible roll is a 20, so it's 35 vs (caster level +11).<br><br>So, 25 levels +11 = 36, which is higher than the Grtr Dispel can possibly score. Ergo, undispellable.<br><br>However, you can still be stripped with Mordenkainen's Disjunction.<br><br><br>***The actual formula of Dispels is 1d20 +1 per caster level (max +5 with Lesser Dispel, +10 with Dispel, and +15 with Grtr Dispel).<br><br>Mord's Disjunction also dispels and it's uncapped (so it's 1d20 + caster level, with no limit). Technically, this means you are never totally safe from being dispelled.<br><br>Hope that wasn't too confusing.<br><br>Check my sig for an awesome substitute for the manual.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Other.Detail&amp;id=729" target="_blank">Grimoire</a>
