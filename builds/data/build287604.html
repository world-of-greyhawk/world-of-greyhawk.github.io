I made a dex based PM, dual-kukri user for more crits = damage. While he doesn't have any form of sneak attack, I designed him for corner sneaking anyway, as he'll technically do more damage that way, since he'll be working against mostly flat footed opponents, which means he'll hit more = do more damage. I debated going the strength route with him and aiming for Dev Crit, but from what I've gathered that's a rather common build, so I stuck with this guy.

Weapon Specialization is effectively reduced to +1 damage only since you have negative STR modifier, and you didn't even take EWS. How will you deal with crit immune enemies?<br><br>And you also didn't mention the Exp penalty at level 4 onwards. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;AB 1st hand: 39/34/29/34<br>AB 2nd hand: 39/34/29/34<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>That's two excess offhand attacks there. You only get 2 offhand tops.<br><br>STR route PMs were done because STR gives damage and PM levels already give AC. Think of it like this:<br><br>STR = damage + AB<br>DEX = AB + AC (and you have too much of this two)<br><br>P.S.
