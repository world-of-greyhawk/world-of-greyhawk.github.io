This build is completely my own work.  I did not reference any other build while I was creating this one.  I did not start with another build and modify it.  Unfortunately, despite all that, the build is unoriginal, derivative, and virtually identical to Dimundome's Power Archer ( <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "139460", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> ).

I would not push str higher than 25 (maybe to 26) unless playing in a world with +10 mighty bows or trying to make an hybrid archer/melee fighter. I would go for more dex in order to get better AB and AC.<br><br>I know you invested there for high dev crit DC, but you can raise it with your bulls str spells and have a bit more consistent dex.<br><br>I think you could start with a bit less int, take less concentration skill and put those int into con for more HP and +1 fortitude saves.<br><br>Also your cha is fairly high, If you dont care losing a few cast-per-day and getting your spells a bit later, I would put the points in con (and leave the int at 14, I love having enough skill points).<br><br>I know it isn't your fault, but I always feel that this kind of builds, and the famous ftr/wiz/AA lack Uncanny Dodge.<br><br>Despite my comments, I like the fact of a singing winged devastating archer.<br>_________________<br>HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh.

Agreed with Fern, though if your point was to have a high-dev crit archer, then you met your goal admirably.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I did want to give the build a high dev. crit. DC, so as to make some small distinguishing feature that differentiated it from similar builds.  If you want to go for a higher dex variant, it would be very easy to change.  Just take dex at 28 and 32.  If you want to drop str to 26, then take dex at 16 and 20 as well, take toughness at 21, and shift forward the epic crit feats by three levels.<br><br>About int to con, as an Elf, I get -2 to con, meaning that I would have to drop int by 2 to get an increase of 1 to con, for no gain in stat bonus.<br><br>About charisma, I took it that high because Bards know lvl 3 spells at lvl 7, but have 0 castings per day, so you need a +3 cha bonus to be able to cast haste, which I wanted to be able to do.
