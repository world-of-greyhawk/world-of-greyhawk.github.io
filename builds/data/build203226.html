<b>Playable from level 1-40... PvM</b><br><br>The idea for this build came about as a rogue build for servers where true-seeing items are common and stealth isn't an option.  This build can do most of the things a rogue can, it can set and disable traps (If the skills aren't high enough you can use the concentration skill points to increase them), use magic devices etc..  It can't pick locks, but when you crit for over a hundred points of damage most locked doors and chests are not much of a problem.  The build did kind of change direction and become an axe dual wielder, but it still works well as a roguish build.  This build will work best in a setting where devastating critical is banned, true seeing is common and immunity to mind spells is available (through another party member or items).  Hence, probably a mid to high magic environment. <br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-Good AB while dualwielding.  A 44 AB while dual wielding is as good as most fighters have with a single weapon.<br>-Nasty Critical Hits.  An x4 multiplier with a 17-20 critical threat range, make this builds critical hits quite painful.<br>-Sneak Attack and Crippling Strike.  He can sap the strength of any opponent he can manage to knockdown.<br>-High UMD.  He can use wands, scrolls and monk equipment to augment his strength.  This gives him a second mode of attack.<br>-Good Trap Setting Ability.  He can find and disable/recover many traps (epic traps excluded), but he may still have to barter for trap kits.  This gives him a third mode of attack.<br>-Good Damage per hit.  It could be better but, baring epic warding, he shouldn't have to worry about damage reduction.<br>-Evasion and a pretty good reflex save vs. spells.  It could be better but he should be able to get some mileage from evasion.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br><br>-Abysmal will save.  I didn't even bother trying to use feats to improve it, even with an epic will it would still be low.  Fortunately, immunity to mind spells is easy to come by (item, protection from evil, potion of clarity, scroll of lesser mind blank, scroll of mind blank, having a mage in your party etc.)<br>-Mediocre Fortitude Save.  It won't save against a devastating critical attack, it should do alright against death magic from an unfocused caster.  Saving throw boosting items are definitely on this character's shopping list.<br><br><b>Pillager</b> <br><br><i>Race</i> Human<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Any<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 16<br>DEX 15<br>CON 14<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>All 10 attribute bonuses go to Strength<br><br><i>Leveling Guide</i><br>Levels 1 Rogue<br>Levels 2-7 Fighter<br>Level 8 Rogue<br>Levels 9-12 Fighter<br>Level 13 Rogue<br>Levels 14-15 Fighter<br>Levels 16-19 Weapon Master<br>Level 20 Rogue<br>Levels 21-23 Weapon Master<br>Level 24 Rogue<br>Levels 25-27 Weapon Master<br>Level 28 Rogue<br>Levels 29-31 Weapon Master<br>Level 32 Rogue<br>Levels 33-35 Weapon Master<br>Level 36 Fighter<br>Levels 37-39 Rogue<br>Level 40 Fighter<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Fighter 14<br>Rogue 10<br>Weapon Master 16<br><br><i>Feats</i><br>Level 1: Dodge, Knockdown<br>Level 2: Weapon Focus (Handaxe)<br>Level 3: Ambidexterity, Two-Weapon Fighting<br>Level 5: Weapon Specialization (Handaxe) <br>Level 6: Mobility<br>Level 7: Expertise<br>Level 9: Improved Knockdown<br>Level 10: Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>Level 12: Improved Critical (Handaxe), Spring Attack<br>Level 15: Whirlwind Attack, Blind-Fight<br>Level 18: Toughness<br>Level 21: Epic Weapon Focus (Handaxe)<br>Level 24: Epic Fortitude<br>Level 27: Epic Reflexes<br>Level 30: Great Strength I<br>Level 31: Epic Prowess<br>Level 33: Great Strength II<br>Level 35: Armor Skin<br>Level 36: Great Strength III<br>Level 39: Great Strength IV, Crippling Strike<br>Level 40: Epic Weapon Specialization (Handaxe)<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 30<br>DEX 15<br>CON 14<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>Hit Points</i> (max every level) 480<br><br><i>Final Saves</i> (Vs.
