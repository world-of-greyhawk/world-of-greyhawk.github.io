Never mind -- miscalculated the bonus for strength, so the AB starts at a paltry 37.

Nice build Ithacan.<br><br>Some notes that I'm sure you've mulled over already, but might be good for readers....<br><br>The version you posted is obviously an elf (Rapier Proficiency). For a human you could use the bonus feat for Martial Weapons Proficiency, then focus in your choice.<br><br>For a non-Dev Crit version (very popular these days) you could free up three feats (Great Cleave, Over. Crit, and Dev. Crit) and  could use CoT Bonus Feats in epic levels for Great Wisdom. With your 3 freed-up feats you could take Empower Spell, Maximize Spell and... something else.<br><br>Great build. I like combat clerics, and combining IKD and the Rogue's Crippling Strike is just plain efficient.<br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br><i>"Where there is life, there is hope." - Grover</i>

Thanks, Kaliban.<br><br>Rapier is a weapon within the rogue weapon proficiency (according to the Grimoire).  The crit range makes it ideal for what we are doing (sword and board).  <br><br>The thing I like about the build is its flexibility and the added bonus of raising dead, which has a premium on most PW's (help your buds avoid the exp and gp loss).  <br><br>I need to get that AB up, though.  40 AB is a minimum, I think.

ya, I just got edumacated on the stacking effect of EWF (I thought it didn't) and WF.  So I am closer.  I have rebuilt it with monk instead of rogue, will post soon.

His caster level is high enough that he can bypass item based SR with a Mordenkainen's Disjunction.

Always good to be able to avoid an attack.<br><br>-Good Reflex Save and Improved evasion.  He doesn't have to worry about spells with a reflex save for half damage<br><br>-7D6 sneak attack.  With improved knockdown and mage spells like darkness, timestop, the bigby's hand spells etc. he can land many sneak attacks against his enemies.<br><br>-Good skill set.  He can sneak around, find and disable/recover traps, set traps and open locks. He can use knock on high DC locks and he can use true seeing to spot concealed opponents.<br><br>-Fair AB.  It could be better but a 40 AB (38 while dual wielding) is pretty high for a rogue wizard. He can use true strike to augment this and land a knockdown for some sneak attacks. In a no or low magic setting, the bonus from greater magic weapon should make him quite competetive.<br><br>Disadvantages<br><br>-Low Spell DCs. He is reliant on spells that have no DCs.<br>-Low hitpoints. 354 is high for this class mix, but low for a character.<br>-Mediocre Fortitude and Will saves. Against spells he is pretty good, but the base saves could be better.<br><br>Final Saves (Vs.

You cannot get to 4 attacks per round with this class makeup unless you stick to monk weapons.  Unarmed attack as a Level 12 monk is pretty good (1d12), though.  And then you get five attacks per round.  Level 16 monk will get you 1d20 damage.  I think on balance you will appreciate the cleric levels though.  You need the five sd levels for defensive roll, a prereq for epic dodge.

Do you think its possible to make that build a dual wileding character and still be effective?

I figured I would use an Avariel for the build to boost the DEX up <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   and still go for a STR build allowing me to have a god damage output even against sneak immuned critters and/or non evilboost his defense. Would have to test it to see if does well in battle.<br>_________________<br>K.M.  aka Chillychill<br><br>"Y'a pire que ne pas pouvoir, y'a savoir qu'on peut et ne jamais tenter"<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kaelaenn Mort'Noire on 08/25/05 16:25</span></i></p>

Well, you are talking to a big believer in strength builds.  Almost all of my builds dish it out.  There is something vaguely annoying about a rapid-fire build that hits for miniscule damage over and over.  Two hits and you're done is more fun.  <br><br>Good hunting.

their is some missing word in my previous post, dont know why <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">   The point was taking trickery and plant as domains to help boost his defense<br>_________________<br>K.M.  aka Chillychill<br><br>"Y'a pire que ne pas pouvoir, y'a savoir qu'on peut et ne jamais tenter"
