This is only my second ever build and I was aiming for a spellcasting archer.

Some questions and suggestions for you....<br><br>Why take so many Fighter levels if you want to be a Wizard/Arcane Archer? Perhaps you should drop Fighter to 6 or so and bump AA to 17?<br><br>Why have a Constitution that gives a hit point penalty (and then take Toughness and Epic Toughness I and II)? And why put points into Charisma?<br><br>Assuming you're going to start Con at 10 (and not 8 like you have it now) I'd push Toughness back a few levels, since at level 1, it only gives you 1 extra hit point. I'd move it to 6 or 9 where it will start making more of a difference.<br><br>Take Weapon Spec before Improved Crit. The extra damage will affect every hit.<br><br>As an archer, I would probably take Rapid Shot earlier in my career. Surely before Imp. Crit.<br><br>Instead of Epic Toughness I'd opt for Epic Prowess and Epic Weapon Focus.<br><br>You should take at least one Fighter level in Epic so you can take Epic Weapon Spec: Longbow.<br><br>You may want to put a point in Open Lock and Disable Traps to permit some use with these skills.<br><br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br><i>This space for rent</i>

Looks more like he wants an archer who can also blast out some powerful spells like IGMS and the Bigby's.  Some of the disabling Bigby spells can be very useful for an archer, who would want to keep the enemy far away.  Frankly, other than bard song and UMD, I think going bard would give him far less variety, not more.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 10/01/05 21:57</span></i></p>

Well there's a lot to be said for wiz 21, fighter 6, AA 13.<br><br>For one, you'll be a lot better able to offset your low hitpoints with epic warding and epic mage armor, you'll still have the chance to take weapon spec/epic weapon spec, and with the epic penetration feat you'll be able to land spells all the time on anything but a monk after hitting them with just greater spell breach (so you don't have to use the 9th level disjunction spell to lower SR if you don't want to).<br><br>In a nutshell that would be my recommendation for a level split given what you seem to want to accomplish with this character.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

So the 12 fighter levels for 4 attacks per round is too much of a sacrifice to AA and wiz levels??

AA has 1/1 BAB progression so taking enough lvls preepic would grant you 4 attacks per round anyhow. You could take one even number fighter lvl in epic on a feat level(21st lvl for example) to get EWF, EWS (longbow) at the same time<br><br>For the Wiz21/AA13/Fg6 build, you could go Fg4/AA10/Wz6 pre epic for example. It would grant you +1 BAB, +4 ref, +3 fort (but -1 will). <br>Even in your original build, taking some AA lvls pre-epic would boost your saves (AA has ref AND fort as primary saves) and AB if AA lvls are taken at the expense of Wiz lvls.<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/02/05 11:13</span></i></p>

i would suggest to skip the fighter and take 2sd lvls instead, mobility is a nice feat for aa , and 2sd will give you hips , you can max out tumble an you get uncanny dodge ...due to your low lvl caser lvl it ll be easy to dispell your trueseeing.<br><br>i would suggest 23wiz2sd15aa (you need at least 22wizzie  lvls to get epic mage armor and warden,and you will need those spells,23wiz grants u n extra feat)<br><br>you still get 26bab what qualifies you for 5attacks /round if you are hasted

How's about going Fighter 8/ Wizzy 23/ AA 9... F 7/ W 5/ AA 8 pre-epic to get 15 BAB... you could take Auto-Still or Auto-Quicken spells this way or just more Int... with Haste and Rapid Shot you could get 6 shots a round. Focus in Illusion (since it's the only Focus that's not spell depleting... cept you lose Prot From Spells (+8 saves vs. spells)) and then Spell Focus, GSF, and ESF all in Evocation to boost your Bigsby spells and elemental spells. Hold em, cold em and bolt em... well arrow them but bolt em fits better. See if that still fits what you want to do.
