Looks good.  I have just a few questions.  First, why no Move Silently investment?  Second, would taking Undead Shape serve a better purpose than Energy Resistance?  Third, Would it be wise to drop 2 Great Strengths to acquire Armor Skin and a second bonus feat in Epic?<br><br>Also, you have your 1st Shifter bonus feat taken at 33rd instead of 34th.  And it's "Kobold," not "Kobald".<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 07/19/06 21:16</span></i></p>

Kobold, lol, oops. What can I say other than I typed this up at work.<br><br>The first Shifter bonus feat I forgot to change when I moved some levels around.<br><br>As far as Undead shape and the Epic Energy resistances, that's completely fine to change them if you would like. On my pw fire damage is pretty heavy and the Energy Resistances: Fire benifited me more than undead shape (I tried it both ways).<br><br>Sounds good trading two great strength feats for Armor skin and another feat, you would only lose one ab for more ac.<br><br>I think a better way to go would be to drop widom to 12 and raise intelligence to 12 and use the extra skillpoints for move silently. As it was I didn't have many skillpoints to spare on it.

I like this, I've used a Dev Kobold build before, and they are probably the most powerful characters you can make.<br><br>Except mine had monk... not barbarian.<br><br>nice<br>_________________<br>They were all dead. The final gunshot was an exclamation mark to everything that had led up to this point. I released my finger from the trigger. And then it was all over. The storm seemed to lose its frenzy.

I like this build, too. A two-foot fellow, a Kobold, or little dragon, with dev.crit &amp; terrifying rage - neat! I'd agree with Grizz, re: Armor Skin; for the extra AC and another epic feat. With your hide skills so high, his advice re: the move  silently investment also makes great sense. I'd also be inclined, maybe, on dropping something in favor of knockdown, but not necessary for PvM. Either way, this looks like a fun build, which deserves a fun pic, oui? - once again, Neat! ~ Tyr <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br><a href="http://www.ddo.com/files/98/70/70/73/348.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.ddo.com/files/98/70/70/73/348.jpg</a>
