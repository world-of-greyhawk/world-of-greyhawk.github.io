I tried to do something without any good results.<br>I wanted to do a rogue builds with HiPS that would still be able to do some good damage if fighting an opponent immune to crits/sneak attacks, since I found out that most of those builds usefulness went away on those cases.<br><br>My first thought was adding blackguard to the build and taking divine might and divine shield. Divine might to add damage agaisnt sneak immune ennemies and divine shield to fight against ennemies with true sight. But that way I lost self concealment. I also thought about ninja spy to gain improv invis but the build was still wack. Anyone that has any idea on a build that could do this please tell me.<br><br>Thx in advance<br><br>(sorry for bad english)<br>_________________<br>K.M.  aka Chillychill<br><br>"Y'a pire que ne pas pouvoir, y'a savoir qu'on peut et ne jamais tenter"

Blackguard is an okay choice because you'll get a higher AB, but to make divine might pay off you'll have to have a high charisma, which probably isn't that attractive to a rogue build.<br><br>You could add 20 monk levels, which would give you a 1d20 damage dice weapon (your fists) and empty body, freeing up your feats from self-conceal.<br><br>Fighter's an option you shouldn't overlook.  4 to 6 fighter levels will boost your AB and let you take epic weapon specialization for +6 damage.<br><br>And cleric is an option to consider.  If you can cast Divine Power, Darkfire, and Divine Might you'll be in good shape for doing melee damage.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
