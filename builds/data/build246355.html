He already took Toughness at level 18...<br><br>Hmmmm, those skill focuses aren't really that useful, +3 on checks is very little, only to be taken when there's nothing else... I'd drop at least 1 for Empowered Spell, the other for Extended spell, to get a longer use of Aura of Vitality. Epic Skill Focus does give a good boost, so keeping those is ok.<br><br>I'd start with more INT and less DEX... your skills can still get use of the boost, at least I see Spellcraft not full... besides the base DEX won't matter after shifting, so it's +40 skills with no real penalty.<br><br>I've always liked druid shifters, so I like this build, makes Crippling on Elder Air Elemental, which should go fantastic, and the Stunning Fist DC is not really bad.

Spellcraft isn't full because I took my last level of Druid (the only class with SC as a class skill) at level 30 in order to maintain some slight semblance of playability.  I don't think I really have too much use for more skill points, but if there's something you want them for (heal is important on some servers), it's easy to go dex 10 or dex 12 / con 8 and get 43 more out of the build.<br><br>As for the metamagic, certainly good advice on the Extend Spell, I should have put that in the build.  What are you planning on Empowering, though?  Bull's Strength?  If that's it, it doesn't seem like it's worth much...not that the SFs are worth much, either.<br><br>Thanks for the advice.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Nimueh_Leafbow on 07/09/06 23:56</span></i></p>

My only real objection to this build is that you put a lot into WIS when the build's strength seems to be more on the dex-melee side.  Maybe you should drop that a bit and stock more into DEX.  From what I can tell, that allows for Epic Dodge too, which is nothing to sneeze at.  And I'd take Maximize Spell over your skill focuses.

Less Dex and more Int initialy is good, but you won't gain much because of the point trade off.  Perhaps if you have 1 odd point remaining, you should spend it on STR so that when you run around unshifted you will not be burdened (as much).<br><br>Extend Spell for Shifted folks is key.  Maximize spell is also highly usefull since you want the most bang for your buck.<br><br>Might I also suggest that you "layer" your protection spells too (different from stacking since they won't actually stack).  Layering is casting more than one elemental protection spell of different levels on yourself.  When the first one absorbs to much damage and drops, you'll have your second spell on you to absorb damage the next round.<br><br>If you take Assasin as your third class rather than Rogue, you can avoid the XP penalty.  You will also gain the Assasin spell like feats that you can use while shifted.  (Ghostly Visage, Improved Invisibility, Darkness).  They CAN be cast while shifted!  Your level arrangement will be a bit different, you won't get Crippling Strike, but it's worth thinking about.

Well, Bromium, I'd like you to know that Empowered Spell is always better at buffing than Maximized, why? simple, although the same spell will not stack to itself it will be added whenever casted, so even if you're at a roll, say bull's STR, which is the usual one, you can cast it several times until the good one works and it will work over the low rolls, I've done it, just cast Empowered Bull's over and over and you'll notice that the full roll replaces the others, works fine as it gives 50% more and a Druid can fully cap STR with it.<br><br>Now Ithacan, although the shift is an annoying deal, it can be done and it has been done, in fact I made an Assassin dragon a while back, works good, yet I find Crippling Strike a good idea on Nimueh Leafbow's build, not to be tampered with <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  if you want Assassin you need to go heavy on it for Death Attack's DC.

If you poured all that into Dex, you'd essentially be wasting it, because once you shifted into Air Elemental shape, you'd still have exactly the same Dex value as this build, the one assigned by the shape.<br><br>If you are going to pour that much into Dex, you might as well not waste 20 levels of Druid to get good shifting, and just be a Dex-based sneaker of some sort.

Also, like Thax said, Assassin isn't really worth it most of the time unless you pour the levels and Int into it to get your Death Attack DC nice and high.  Of course, you could stack Int instead of Wis...but that's a different build; I remember Thax's dragon assassin, and it was a beast.
