Well as some may have seen in the general discussion section I have been toying with this idea since I learnt that Divine Might/Shield and smite evil are all useable when shifted. Coupled with a few druid buffs and the full range of paladin spells and abilities I figured this would be an interesting build.<br><br>Plus who doesnt want to use a Holy Risen Lord? or an Epic Kobold with Holy Avenger!<br><br>Anyway I tried to fit in all the shifter shapes but the results were fairly poor - too much wisdom needed meant not enough points to spare for charisma to boost the smites and divine feats.<br><br>So I decided to drop the dragon shapes and stop at construct shape - though without Monk for unarmed bonuses I could probably drop construct as well - most of the immunities and stuff they provide I can get from other shapes - but I like the iron golem model so I stayed with it.<br><br>The results are here<br><br>DISCLAIMER - I've built this in the test module and the build works, I havent played it yet. It looks fairly successful PvM 1-40, as for PvP I don't do it so wouldn't know.<br><br>Race		Human<br>Alignment	Start Lawful Neutral, one change to good at level 5-6<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 	14<br>Dex 	10<br>Con 	10<br>Wis 	16<br>Int 	10<br>Cha 	15<br><br><br>Leveling<br><br>1 	Druid 1 – Power Attack, Cleave<br>2	Druid 2 <br>3 	Druid 3 - Alertness<br>4	Druid 4 - +1 Wis<br>5 	Druid 5<br>6 	Paladin 1 – Extend Spell<br>7 	Paladin 2 <br>8 	Paladin 3 - +1 Cha<br>9 	Paladin 4 – Divine Might<br>10	Shifter 1<br>11 	Shifter 2<br>12 	Paladin 5 – Divine Shield, +1 Wis<br>13 	Shifter 3<br>14 	Shifter 4<br>15 	Shifter 5 - Toughness<br>16 	Shifter 6 - +1 Wis<br>17 	Shifter 7<br>18 	Shifter 8 - Knockdown<br>19	Paladin 6<br>20	Paladin 7 - +1 Wis<br>21	Shifter 9 – Great Wisdom I<br>22	Shifter 10<br>23 	Paladin 8<br>24 	Shifter 11 – Undead Shape, +1 Wis<br>25 	Shifter 12<br>26 	Shifter 13 – Great Wisdom II<br>27 	Shifter 14 – Great Wisdom III<br>28 	Paladin 9 - +1 Wis<br>29 	Shifter 15<br>30 	Shifter 16 – Outsider Shape, Great Wisdom IV<br>31	Paladin 10<br>32 	Paladin 11 - +1 Wis<br>33 	Shifter 17 – Construct Shape<br>34 	Paladin 12<br>35	Paladin 13<br>36 	Paladin 14 – Great Charisma I, +1 Cha<br>37 	Paladin 15<br>38 	Paladin 16<br>39 	Paladin 17 – Great Charisma II<br>40	Paladin 18 - +1 Cha<br><br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 	14<br>Dex 	10<br>Con 	10<br>Wis 	27<br>Int 	10<br>Cha 	20<br><br><br>Skills<br><br>Pretty much anything you like.<br><br>I maxed out Taunt, Discipline, put 20 into Tumble and some in Animal Empathy<br><br><br><br>HP – Max 396<br><br><br>AC – 14 naked<br><br><br>AB – 28/23/18/13<br><br><br>Saves ..start/end<br><br>Fort	30<br>Reflex	24<br>Will	31<br><br><br>In human form he has terrible ab, really needs some good equipment and a decent form to shift into to increase it, but saves are good, can shift into almost all the shapes available in the game and can give a minimum of +5 to AC and damage with divine might and shield - not a lot but every little helps.<br><br>fully buffed with druid/paladin spells and some decent equipment he should do ok<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Caithdein na Briona on 05/30/06 19:42</span></i></p>

I've played around with this kind of build but I never got it working well enough in combat, in my opinion, to post any of the versions I've tried.<br><br>Divine Might and Divine Shield just don't make enough of a difference to get excited over in practice, and they use up valuable feats.  Further, even counting divine feats, the final stats are all generally inferior to the standard monk shifter setup.<br><br>You can improve your BAB and make the build more combat-effective by doing 16 pal/5 druid/17 shifter/2 pal as your level scheme, but playability will probably suffer and you'll have to change alignments twice.<br><br>I found the most combat-success in doing that kind of levelling split and in focusing on one of the epic humanoid shapes - taking EWF in longsword or shortsword for the drow or kobold forms, in particular, since the whip cost an extra feat (exotic prof).<br><br>I don't know if the construct shape is bringing anything to your build that undead shape doesn't, unless you're worried about being Turned.  If you drop it you can free up a couple points of wisdom and put them towards charisma.<br><br>And I think your best offensive option is going to be the rakshasa form.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Well, IMO, the best combat "shifter" with Divine feats/spells/abilities/whatever would be a Druid/Monk/Paladin focused on Improved Elemental forms, for instance, the Improved Earth Elemental gets a very high STR score, for a great AB that could couple very well with Divine Might, a blast of power in low magical worlds, while an Improved Air Elemental with Divine Shield would get an "almost-dragon" AC, pretty high, or couple Improved Fire Elemental 1d10 fire damage with your Divine Might, pretty good option too.<br><br>Making it should be easy, you'd get a neat amount of buffs too an you'll only need 19 WIS (20 is better of course), and the rest can go in CHA. I know, it's a bad time to say this because you made a topic asking for suggestions, but I didn't think of it until now.<br><br>Your build is interesting, for the least, you'll need a good shape to stay alive around, I'm more concerned about the AC, while Divine Shield will help a lot, Dodge AC doesn't works wen you're in mobs, and you haven't much more options to buf AC.
