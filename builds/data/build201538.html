<b>Playable from levels 1-40... PvM</b><br><br>I was asked recently for a good support character for party play.  Instantly my thoughts went to a bard/rogue/AA, but when I searched the guild I didn't find any that made use of the bard abilities.  I threw this build together as a party support archer.  It should do well in any party setting, it can buff a party as well as help out in combat with ranged sneak attacks.  With find traps, improved invisibility and an okay open lock skill it also makes a fair scout.  Pretty much what you want in a support archer.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-Level 16 Bard Song and Curse Song.  With lasting inspiration it lasts 11 rounds and is good for buffing a party, and weakening your opposition.<br>-7D6 sneak attack.  In general, without hide in plain sight, ranged sneak attacks are hard to come by.  In a party setting, they are quite easy to get.  You can also use darkness and ultravision to get a couple more.<br>-High taunt skill.  Combined with curse song he can low an opponents AC by 11 points.  The fighters in the party should love that.<br>-Level 5 Bard spells.  If buffed, he can cast level 6 spells. The level 1-4 bard spells are pretty good, the level 5 and 6 bard spells aren't that handy though.<br>-A high AB with a long bow.  46 is a little low for an Arcane Archer, but in general good for a support character.<br>-Epic dodge.  Always a useful ability.<br>-A good AC with +5 equipment.<br>-High Reflex save and improved evasion.  He doesn't have to wory about evocations with reflex saves.<br>-High UMD.  He can use monk equipment.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br><br>-Low Fortitude and Will saves.  He has to watch out for death magic.  With bard song and resistance he can buff his will save a bit and clarity can defend from mind spells.<br>-Low hitpoints.  He can't take too much damage.<br>-Low damage.  Without sneak attacks his arrows don't do too much damage.  Arrows also do piercing damage, which is the most commonly resisted damage type.<br>-No melee capability.  He has to use his bow at close range, which means that he could take quite the pummeling if an opponent closes with him.<br>-XP penalty.  The elven favored class makes no sense, it should be bard or rogue.<br><br><b>Generic Support Archer</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Elf<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Any non lawful<br><br><i>Base Attribute</i><br>STR 10   <br>DEX 16<br>CON 12 <br>WIS 8<br>INT 14 <br>CHA 16 <br><br><i>Leveling Guide</i><br>Level 1 Rogue<br>Levels 2-6 Bard<br>Level 7-8 Rogue<br>Level 9 Bard<br>Levels 10-14 Arcane Archer<br>Level 15 Bard<br>Levels 16-17 Arcane Archer<br>Level 18 Bard<br>Levels 19-21 Arcane Archer<br>Level 22 Bard<br>Level 23 Rogue<br>Level 24 Bard<br>Levels 25-26 Rogue<br>Level 27 Bard<br>Levels 28-29 Rogue<br>Level 30 Bard<br>Levels 31-32 Rogue<br>Level 33 Bard<br>Levels 34-36 Rogue<br>Levels 37-39 Bard<br>Level 40 Arcane Archer<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Arcane Archer 11<br>Bard 16<br>Rogue 13<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>All 10 go to Dexterity<br><br><i>Feats</i><br>Level 1: Point Blank Shot<br>Level 3: Weapon Focus (Longbow)<br>Level 6: Rapid Shot<br>Level 9: Curse Song <br>Level 12: Called Shot<br>Level 15: Lingering Song<br>Level 18: Improved Critical (Longbow)<br>Level 21: Epic Weapon Focus (Longbow)<br>Level 24: Epic Prowess<br>Level 27: Epic Skill Focus (Taunt)<br>Level 30: Great Dexterity I<br>Level 32: Improved Evasion<br>Level 33: Great Dexterity II<br>Level 36: Defensive Roll, Epic Dodge<br>Level 39: Blind-Fight<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 10<br>DEX 28<br>CON 12<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 16<br><br><i>Final Saves (Vs.

I think you can use half-elf as well for AA... and would remove the XP penalty (your starting stats as fairly midlle-ground, though you might lose a point or two overall).

A couple notes Mith:<br><br>You could drop your CHA to 15 and go with a 1/2 Elf for no XP penalty, if you wish. (You could also drop it on the Elf template and use those 2 points elsewhere if you like.) You need to boost your CHA (with items) to 22+ in order to access those level 6 spells, so I wouldn't really bother. Just a thought.<br><br>*edit* Never mind - you need it for Epic Dodge.<br><br>Lingering Song (you called it Lasting Inspiration, but I know you meant Lingering) adds 5 rounds to your Bard Song, so it's going to last 15 rounds, not 11 (The Bard Song lasts 10 rounds normally).<br><br>Nice build - great support character.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 06/27/05 15:49</span></i></p>

The build was a little straped for skill points, and a 16 charisma gave me a bonus to UMD, taunt and perform. It also gave me an extra level 3 spell.  Also a +6 to charisma isn't that difficult to get, so you might get a level 6 spell.  I wouldn't count on a level 6 spell, but it's always nice to have the option.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Lingering Song (you called it Lasting Inspiration, but I know you meant Lingering) adds 5 rounds to your Bard Song, so it's going to last 15 rounds, not 11 (The Bard Song lasts 10 rounds normally).<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Yeah, they shouldn't have given the two bard feats that extend your bard song names that begin with "L".
