Is there an advantage to taking spell focus other than evocation, illusion, or necromancy?  Example: Would taking transmustion spell focus make your summons better?  Not a mage player, so this is all new to me.  <br><br>Also, trying to build a gnome wizard assasin who uses an xbow.  How do I maximize the death attack with this arrangement?<br><br>Thanks in advance!

and IMO focus in evocation isnt worth it since most spells wont allow a saving throw anyways.<br><br>Thinking of that, at wich point do you consider a DC to be high? 50? 60? more?<br><br>And is there any tables that shows the saving throws of each classes at lvl 40? thx a lot<br>_________________<br>K.M.  aka Chillychill<br><br>"Y'a pire que ne pas pouvoir, y'a savoir qu'on peut et ne jamais tenter"

The two best schools (offensive wise) to take Spell Focus in are usually Transmutation and Necromancy as they have spells with DC's that if high are deadly. Necro has the obvious wail etc, and Transumtation has a personal favorite of mine Flesh to stone.Most DC spells at a 40 lvl mage will have a 45-50 DC if they take Spell Foci in it and have hgh int.<br>_________________<br>~I am the wisest man on earth because I know one thing, and that is I know nothing.~<br>-Cairne
