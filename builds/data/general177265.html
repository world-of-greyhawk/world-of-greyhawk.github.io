Is is possible to build a Cleric archer Hider build with a base AB of 49 (60 with +5 items and +6 from stats)? in some kind of multiclass combo..go wild with the idea.<br>The only idea that comes to my mind is Cleric 18/Monk 9/Shadow Dancer 13 but AB would be below my target. anyone have some better suggestions?

Cleric/Bard/Arcane Archer<br>Start with either 18 DEX or 18 WIS (if going zen archery)<br>Cleric 8/Bard 2/Arcane Archer 10 at level 20<br><br>This gives a BAB of +17 at level 20.Regardless of how you level after this you will end up with +27 at level 40.<br><br>Feats <br>Weapon Focus (+1)<br>Epic Weapon Focus (+2) (AA level 13 bonus feat)<br>Epic prowess (+1) (AA level 16 bonus feat)<br>This raises it to BAB 31<br>Wisdom starting at 18 <br>Level 20 WIs =23<br><br>Level 21 Great wis 1 (24)<br>Level 24 Great Wis 2 (25) Wis =26<br>Level 27 Great Wis 3 (27)<br>Level 28 WIS =28<br>Level 30 Great Wis 4 (29)<br>Level 32 WIS =30<br>Level 33 Great Wis 5 (31)<br>Level 36 WIS =32 . Grea Wis 6(33)<br>Level 39 Feat<br>Level 40 wis =34 <br>This gives you +12 due to wisdom<br>This brings bab to 43<br><br>Now you can mix the levels but take a late bard level to maximise sneak skills and perhaps UMD. <br>Now levels to be are Cleric 20/Bard 4 / AA 16.<br>AA gives you Enchant arrow 8 for an additional 8 AB to make a grand total of 51 AB. <br><br>Syrath

You can change great wis to great dex if you want the AC benefits. Use wis if you want benefit to your cleric levels (no idea which is better id go dex). You can raise AB by lowering cleric level and raising AA level. If you do take dex route and get Great dex as  AA bonus feats. For every additional 6 levels AA you get +4 AB (+1 from dex +3 from enchant arrow)<br><br>Syrath

You only need a dexterity of 28 to tie the AC provided by a Full Plate armor thus an 18 dex with +12 from items can easily beat it.<br><br>Cleric spells are helpful but not <i>that</i> helpful (ie helpful only in some situations).<br><br>Also if you went elf (assuming you don't care about the xp penalty) you could easily get your DEX much much higher and not only would you have a higher AB and AC but you could put the Zen Archery Feat toward something else.<br><br>To me an extra few spells won't make as much of a difference as a higher AB and AC and extra feat.  Also this build doesn't look like it's aimed at getting a super high DC for spells so much as it is for buffing to supplement the AA strength so losing a bit of Wisdom won't hurt too much in that respect.<br><br>As far as the build itself, I've used similiar ones and they're extremely fun to play, so it's a good suggestion for fun.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>~Terra~<br>_________________<br>When I am working on a problem I never think about beauty. <br>I only think about how to solve the problem. <br>But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong.
