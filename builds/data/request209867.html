Hey everyone. First of all, I just wanted to say thanks to the creators of this guild, as well as the wonderful people who supply people like me with build information and advice so kindly. I've been thanklessly using these forums for a long time now, and I feel it's time for me to show my gratitude.<br><br>On to the topic at hand, I'm looking for a good build that utilizes stunning fist with optimal proficiency. I want a good balance between AB and Stunning Fist DC. I did find one, named "Enter The Jade Empire", but it's AB was a bit too low for my liking, despite the admirable DC. I need at least a minimum AB in the High 40's. (48+)<br><br>After reviewing his build, I tried one of my own. As someone who enjoys making unique builds, I decided to try out a Monk/Shifter/Druid, utilizing the Construct Shape. This produced better results than the aforementioned build, the High Wisdom giving me a great DC, Great AC, and the Iron Golem giving a strength boost to make up for my AB as well as awesome immunities. However, it's AB was still too low for my tastes.<br><br>So, I turn to you, the wonderful people of the Epic Character Builders forums. If anyone knows of a build already posted here that I've missed, or has any ideas for me to try out, I would absolutely love to hear it.<br><br>Thank you,<br>~Acothea
