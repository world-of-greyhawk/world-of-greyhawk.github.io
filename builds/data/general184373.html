Before you spam the Build Request topic/thread with a new request, be sure to search through the list of posted builds. Then, if you see something similar to what you want but not ideal you can post that so builders have a better idea of what you're looking for. eg "I'm looking for a fighter-barbarian with great DR. I checked out the Sassy Barbarian build, but suspenders are outlawed on my PW so I need something a little different, maybe with cummerbund instead?"<br><br>Seriously though, someone said they wanted a melee build with fighter and barbarian levels that had good HP and good DR. Off the top of my head I could think of three builds posted already that meet that criteria. Just go to the list of builds and hit Control-F for find, then enter the desired class in the search field. Or better you, install the MSN toolbar that has the Highlight function so it highlights all instances of that word on the entire page and has a mini-view that lets you jump down the page to the highlighted text.<br><br>And repliers... when you're replying with suggestions you should QUOTE the request post to which you're resoponding so readers know which build request you're addressing.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br>Check out the Epic Character Builders Guild<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Test your new builds in this mod:<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/modules/data/1073117317280.shtml" target="_blank">Click Here</a>
