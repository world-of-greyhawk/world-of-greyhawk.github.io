Is anyone familiar with Dex Monsters? Char builds that use dexterity to an almost avatar-like advantage? I have been trying to piece together a rogue/fighter/SD build that uses dual kukris and ends at about 110 hide and close ms, but no matter what i do or how i piece her up it fails to meet what i expected.  can anyone help me out, or point me to a build that is similar? i am more of a bash and crash builder, with bulky inhumanly strengthed fighters and what not, so this is a bit, erm...difficult, to say easily.  I appreciate any help.<br><br>                          Aeris<br>                     -aka- Bohemian Rhapsody86<br>_________________<br><i>"Oh, very well.

Try one of the Druid/monk/SD builds. You work on the wisdom as you level, but the eventual dragonshape dexterity added to natural armor and wisdom bonus AC from monk make you a formidibly hard target to hit. Also, your druid spells one with the land, camoflauge and mass camoflauge can easily send you into the 100+ region for hide and move silent. Oh, and you can attack many times per round with your monk unarmed bonus and an obscene strength bonus.... no kukris though. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">
