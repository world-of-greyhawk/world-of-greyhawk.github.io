Nice twist on the Teutonic Knight, the Great Smites are now enough to make it worth and you've got a better Divine Wrath althoguh it's usable only once a day (what a shame, I'd like to get some more uses per day, 3 would seem fair).<br><br>As also in your other build, I suggest to get the 4th FTR lvl asap, for earlier WS which will help your damage output given the fact you raise your STR only late. At lower lvls that systematical +2 to damage counts.<br><br>Well done Debby. You pulled out a nice series of theme builds. I believe you got me inspired on a new theme build, btw <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!

Looks good.  It manages good saves, good AC, an okay buffed AB and some smiting damage.  Just a couple of minor points:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/05/06 05:55:17 (GMT) -- TyrTemplar<br><br>Saving Throws<br>Fort:   43 (+4 Spells), +9 Divine Wrath (12 Rounds)<br>Will: 	35 (+4 Spells), +9 Divine Wrath (12 Rounds)<br>Reflex: 34 (+4 Spells), +9 Divine Wrath (12 Rounds)<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Be a little careful here, Sacred Defense counts towards the +20 saving throw cap, as does the spellcraft bonus and Divine Wrath bonus.  So with just Divine Wrath, you're at +19.  Not that it matters, those saves are plenty high.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>* COMBAT VITALS: <br>BAB: 30, AB (max, naked): 39<br>+2 Bull's Strength<br>+5 Greater Magic Weapon (OR Holy Sword)<br>--<br>AB: 46 (Effective 16 hours, or per rest period)<br>--<br>+5 Divine Favor<br>+1 Bless<br>+1 Aid<br>+1 Prayer<br>+1 Deafening Clang<br>+9 Divine Wrath<br>--<br>Combat AB 64, +6 Taunt, + IKD (Self-Buffs Only, No Equipment)<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Actually 61, you hit the +20 AB cap (59) and get an extra +2 from Bull's Strength.  Also deafening clang adds a weapon enhancement bonus which doesn't stack with GMW or Holy Sword.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>12: Paladin(10): CHA+1, extra turning, (CHA=18)<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I might be inclined to take extend spell instead of extra turning.  Paladin spells don't last long, and a two turn divine favor is much nicer than a 1 turn.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

No wonder you have many builds already since you re-post all your builds 5 times. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>Also Deb, why do you keep typing AB, + taunt(valid), + IKD. IKD <b>penalizes</b> your AB, not increases it. Even though 1 build used a <i>already knoccked-down</i> opponent to show how high AB that was possible, you can't really use that in a build as a strength. It's a thing that <b>every</b> 1st level character can do, remember. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Rock on.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 03/06/06 18:56:45 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br>Trollborn Asgardian by the master of the Norse legends, Grimnir himself!<br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Thanks, guys! <br>First, the AB thing - egads, I *really* did think I fixed that from the original post (and seriously sorry everyone). Thanks, Mith: I appreciate that (um, um, um, if a mod should have some time to please, please edit that? With apologies, everyone). <br><br>The saves: posted a list as to available enhancements, so can pick and choose, accordingly. this, 'cause as Kail just puts so well, that Divine Wrath, while just so very amazing, well, it should come with a label along the lines: "break in case of emergency" since it's available only once per day, or rest period. Ah, but it does toss such a great boost into saves, damage, and AB, lasting the duration of the cha-bonus, so guess it's one of those balancing things (oh, but Kail: I do so hears ya, and totally agree: 3 times per day, should be 3!! <br><br>Although this one's specifically for PvE (or PvM), still wanted it to be adjustable for PvP, thus made it a point to give the Teutonic high saves (and thanks for that, Mith: appreciate your compliment!). As to extend spell, that is a good idea, as he's a lot of turning already, but should be pointed out that, unlike his cha bonus from turning, his spells at only level 16 pally may be vulnerable to dispel, dependent on the enviironmment. If not worried about that, then might consider that (ie. extend instead) as bein' a valid option (thanks, Mith),<br><br>Grim, thanks so much for the compliment, and I do so like your smiter, too! As to IKD, puts that in there for a point of comparison, to the Knight Commander build.  Also, IKD's listed for our play-tip theme: i.e., before smiting, make sure to land the IKD, then taunt, and then smite to make sure your smites are effective - not like he's got GS 5, or GS 10 to play with <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">          But GS 4, with high saves, decent AB and all that other stuff, this should do ya quite well for PvE/PvM . . . and with IKD and skills, brings in a lot more utility, and makes him adjustable, depending on the environment.<br><br>Kail: thanks so much for the praise, and right back at you re: yer build and cool concept, too! So glad to hear you like the Templar theme; yeah, had a lot of fun on this series, that's for sure. And I inspired you did I? Oh, how very wonderful: be assured that I'm awaitin' your series with most anxious anticipation <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">             (wonderful!)<br><br>Thanks, guys. As always, appreciate your comments, eyes, ideas, and nice praise, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">          <br><br>Tyr<br><br>As to the series, once again, it consists of five (5) knights, as follows:<br><br>1) Teutonic Knight, FTR/Pally/COT, for PvE or PvM play, but adjustable for PvP too, having some neat tricks.<br><br>2) Knight Commander, Ftr/Pally/Cot, high level pally, and balanced as b/w combat prowess and smitin', for PvP but also PvE or PvM, too; he'd be our power pally so to speak in the series.<br><br>3) Knight Templar, Pally/Bard/Cot, having a touch of both the divine and the arcane; not a smiter per se, but with high saves, AB +40 and the ability to deliver decent combat and arcane damage, and including some nice skills (i.e., UMD/scroll access for added buffs &amp; versatility), a nice complement of bard spells, and, of course, the ability to use all those great bard toys <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">            <br><br>4) Blood Knight, the Fallen Pally (pally/monk/BG) in our series, not a smiter per pe, but with all sorts of great abilities all his own <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">            <br><br>5) Medieval Scout (Pally/Rogue/Cot - a dexed-based holy warrior, also not a smiter, but instead with great stealth and combat prowess, and the ability to deliver good sneak and regular damage. He'd be the "James Bond" type/secret agent in our series.<br><br>Thanks everyone. I really hope everyone enjoys the series, with the idea being that there's now a special knight out there for everyone who wants to get in on the Templar legend and fun. Enjoy!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/09/06 08:20</span></i></p>
