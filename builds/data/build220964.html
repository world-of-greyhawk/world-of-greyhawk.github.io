Since it's RDD 10 builds time on the forum I decided to add my own contribution. This build was developed indipendently but it is similar to the Grizzled Dwarflord's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "193429", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Dwarven Warmonger</a>. Also in grizz's OP there was a talk about going with my same lvl split but nothing specific was posted.<br>If alignment changes are an issue take all the 6 preepic bard lvls in a row then take the last 3 bard lvls as your last character lvls. This way you get just 2 alignment changes in your career (from non lawful to lawful and back again...pick neutral something for a start).<br>RDD lvls are taken early on to make use of the stats boost asap, if that is not a concern one might want to change the preepic leveling to bard 6/RDD 4/DwD 10 for +1 AB (saves stay the same) but you need to take 6 bard lvls straight away.<br>The Draconic Wall is a stout defender able to stand massive damage (DR 24/- and around 700 HP) with ease and can shake off many spells (good ST). His hardened skin and acrobatic skill make him harder to hit and he can move around in full plate and tower shield without provoking AoO. His sight inspires his allies and demoralizes his enemies (lvl 8 bard song+curse song) and his sharp tongue has often been deadlier than his axe (maxed taunt). He has the skill to use almost all the magical devices/scrolls he might find (35 UMD) and has some spells of his own to get ready for battle.<br>His training as a dwarven defender has granted him the power to stand his ground against hordes of enemies (defensive awareness, no flanking!), calling to his inner strenght to become a fiercer and harder to kill warrior (+4 dodge AC, +2 STR, +4 CON, +2 saves, 11 times/day).<br>And besides all the rest this dwarf his damn goodlooking <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">     ... oh well, wings apart <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    <br>Enjoy it!<br><br><br>Draconic Wall (Bard 8/Red Dragon Disciple 10/ Dwarven Defender 22)<br>Dwarf, alignment changes necessary (suggested starting alignment true neutral)<br><b>PvM playable 1-40</b> <i>(apart alignment changes), PvP unknown</i><br><br>STR 14 (30)<br>CON 16 (22)<br>DEX 14<br>INT 14 (16)<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 12 (14)<br><br>HP: 676 (756 in DS)<br>SkP: 214<br><br>BAB: 26	<br>AB: 40 (41 in DS)	<br>AC (naked/plate/plate and tower shield): 26/33/36 (+4 in DS)<br>DR 24/-<br>Breat Attack 6d10 DC=19<br><br>SAVES (vs Spells) <br>For  29 (39) +4 in DS<br>Ref  25 (35) +2 in DS<br>Will 25 (35) +2 in DS<br><br>SKILLS<br>Lore 8 (11)<br>Tumble 40 (42)<br>UMD 33 (35)<br>Discipline 43 (53)<br>Perform 13 (15) lvl 8 bard song<br>Spellcraft 37 (40) +8 saves vs spell<br>Taunt 40 (42)<br>no points leftover<br><br><br>SPELL SLOTS<br>3/4/4/1<br><br><br><br>1  Bard 1  Lingering Song			<br>2  Bard 2				<br>3  Bard 3  Toughness			<br>4  Bard 4  STR (STR 15)<br>5  Bard 5				<br>6  RDD  1  Dodge			<br>7  RDD  2  (STR 17)<br>8  RDD  3  STR (STR 18)<br>9  RDD  4  KD (STR 20)<br>10 RDD  5				<br>11 RDD  6				<br>12 DwD  1  WF (Battleaxe or Greataxe), CON (CON 17)<br>13 RDD  7  (CON 19)<br>14 DwD  2				<br>15 DwD  3  IC			<br>16 DwD  4  CON (CON 20)<br>17 DwD  5				<br>18 Bard 6  Curse Song			<br>19 DwD  6				<br>20 RDD  8  CON (CON 21)<br>21 RDD  9  EWF (INT 16)<br>22 RDD  10 (CHA 14, STR 24)<br>23 Bard 7				<br>24 DwD  7  IKD, CON (CON 22)<br>25 DwD  8				<br>26 DwD  9				<br>27 DwD  10 EDR I			<br>28 DwD  11 STR (STR 25)<br>29 DwD  12				<br>30 DwD  13 EDR II			<br>31 DwD  14 EDR III		<br>32 DwD  15 STR (STR 26)<br>33 DwD  16 Great STR I (STR 27)<br>34 DwD  17				<br>35 DwD  18 AS		<br>36 DwD  19 Great STR II, STR (STR 29)<br>37 Bard 8				<br>38 DwD  20				<br>39 DwD  21 Epic Reflexes			<br>40 DwD  22 Epic Prowess, STR (STR 30)<br><br><br>As always, comments and constructive criticism is gladly appreciated.<br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br><br>edit: added breath attack<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 12/02/05 23:16</span></i></p>

That would be because you took RDD to 8 pre-epic while I took DwD to 10 I guess -_- *sigh*<br><br>*crawls back into sleepy hole to try and get more much-needed sleep*<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

i recall something like that dd dmg reduction and epic dr are not stacking , maybe im messing up something , not sure. <br><br>also wouldnt it be helpful to take the 4 epic elemental resists? depending on the environment you play in it could be more worth it than epic dr.

My Dwarven Bard/RDD/BG gets only 1 lower AB, and that is a Smiting build. I think 40 is low for a RDD build, but still it is a mean machine. The extra Bard levels makes it stronger than only 5 can do.

My bad, 4bards pre epic isn't enough, lore 8 as RDD pre requisite means at least 5 lvls bard in this build. DwD needs +7BAB and becomes accessible even later. Anyhow 1 more AB is squuezable  out of the build by changing lvling as you said. <br>This lvl up was written for settings where alignment changes are NOT an issue, otherwise one should take the first 6 bard lvls straight away and wait to take the last two lvls at the end of the carrer. That minimizes the alignment changes to just 2. I agree that's one more change than rp-wise acceptable. As the dwarflord said going once from a non lawful alignment to lawful is easily acceptable as character growth...going back to non lawful is really cheesy instead <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>True, 40 AB is not impressive (and 41 is the best one can get with these classes) but it's not that bad either. And you've got some nice buffs too.<br>And let me say it again, where else are you gonna meet such a charming and good looking dwarven defender? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>Thanks all for the feedback.<br>Cheers<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò
