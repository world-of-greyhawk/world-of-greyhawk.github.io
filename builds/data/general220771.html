Will 40 more HPs be of great value? If not, then go with the Imp Crit feat. But, it really depends on the build and the environment.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;if someone can break it down i like that. and what is the maximum AB someone can have with all bonuses and stuff?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Maximum AB is:<br><br>BAB<br>+ feats (WF, EWF, Epic Prowess, Weapon Master Superior Weapon Focus, WM Epic Superior Weapon Focus, AA Enchant Arrow)<br>+ ability modifier*<br>+ enhancements**<br><br>*This can be boosted by a maximum of +12 over your base, for a further +6 to AB.<br><br>**This includes any spell effects, Bard Song boosts, weapon enhancements, etc. up to a maximum of +20 combined.<br><br>An example: Let's assume you have a character with 29 BAB, Weapon Focus, Epic Weapon Focus, Epic Prowess, and 30 STR. His AB is:<br><br>+29 (BAB)<br>+4 (WF, EWF, EP)<br>+10 (30 STR)<br><br>Total AB = +43<br><br>Now, we give him +12 to STR. His AB is now +49 (he gets a further +6 to his STR modifier)<br><br>Now, let's give him a +10 weapon. His AB is now +59.<br><br>Now, let's assume a Bard in the party sings for +2 AB boost, a Cleric casts Battle Tide for another +2, Bless for +1, Aid for +1, and Prayer for another +1. That's a further +7 to his AB, giving him +66 AB.<br><br>Now, assume he reads True Strike from a scroll. True Strike gives him +20 to AB, but he's already enhanced it through magic/weapon enhancements by +17, so he only has +3 left to reach the cap. Therefore, True Strike will only boost his AB to the maximum of +69.<br><br>I see from re-reading that this is a bit complicated. Apologies. I find the easiest way to figure it out is this:<br><br>Figure your BAB.<br>Add in your feats (as listed above)<br>Add in your ability unbuffed modifier.<br><br>Figure the total. This is your AB, unbuffed. <br><br>Now, add in +6 for a possible +12 boost to your ability (be it STR, DEX, or WIS, whichever you're using as your to-hit ability). Add a further +20 (all other possible ways of boosting your AB will fall under this cap) The total will be your highest possible AB for your character.<br><br>In short, your highest possible AB is your unbuffed AB + 26.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

compare a 16 CON adding 2 more Great STRs = 44AB<br>vs<br>an 18 CON adding 2 more Great CONs = 43 AB but +40 HPs<br><br>obviously a STR build<br><br>hey thanks for helping me figure out that whole plus thing. your description helped me see what happens when you add Truestrike to something already buffed.
