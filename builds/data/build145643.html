You don't see many two bladed sword builds (any?) which is actually a really good weapon.  Especially when the base dmg of a weapon comes in handy since dual wielding longswords gives ya -4 ab as opposed to -2.  The biggest problem I've found on pw and using less popular weapons is that it's impossible to find any good ones.  If you ask someone where you can find a decent tbs they will give ya a really funny look.  Ya'd think DMs would be able to see past scimitars/rapiers/kukris/greatswords but almost all have been sucked in by some evil weapons union that seeks to have it's members take over the killing business.  Or am I just being paranoid?<br><br>Free Tibet and quit putting flouride in our water!

one of the reasons I chose TBS, the coolness factor is overwhelming when a dwarf cleric is wielding it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

Yes I have a build that is very similar to this, but with Rogue lvls rather than WM.  His AB should be at most 1 point lower; you get another 3 points of AB from Superior weapon focus, but then you lose 2 points from dual-wielding.  Although I agree the 2-bladed sword is a cool weapon, I don't really like dual-wielding in general.  You need at least 15 Dex in order to do it right, it takes 3 feats, and you still end up losing 2 points of AB on every attack you make.  In addition to this, you can't use a shield, so your AC is lower.  <br><br>With your build you should have a 15-20 threat range without Keen Edge, which is the same threat range as my character using a Scimitar.  Of course, you do 3x damage on crits as opposed to my lowly 2x, but then I get 7d6 sneak attacks, Improved Evasion, Crippling Strike, and tons of skill points, and I can actually max Tumble with my build since Rogue gets it as a class skill, so I should have higher AC as well.<br><br>Not to say that it's a bad build; a Fighter/Cleric/WM is actually a very strong melee, and your build looks pretty reasonable.  If you lose the dual-wielding, lower your Dex and wear a shield, your AB and AC would be better, and you free up a few feats as well.  One thing I like about the Rogue, however, is that I can land sneak attacks on Pale Masters, whereas I can't hit them with crits.  Anyway, good build, but you could probably make it a little better.

I agree it would be more powerful using a shield and wielding a scimitar... but I didn't want that. I wanted a battle-cleric with 8 attacks per round (divine + haste), great dmg, great AB, devastating crit. in other words, I wanted to make a uniqe character... it's very easy to use the same leveling schedule and replacing the feats you don't want with "better" ones. this cleric is among the best at what it does though... which is deliver frightfully many devastating crits at a terrific AB.<br><br>and you have to agree, isn't it fun <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>happy gaming <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

btw, I might add I've made another version that does use scimitar and takes 8 levels cleric pre-epic, which makes for a far stronger character 1-40. the 3 extra feats (only 6! fighter levels same cleric) were used for cleave, great cleave (both epic in my posted build) blind-fight, toughness. the epic feats were replaced by an earlier great wis (enabling lvl 8 spells that much sooner) and earlier great str (dito with dev crit) using last feat for natural armour.<br><br>hmmmm in other words I added blind-fight, toughness and natural armour.<br><br>this char is way stronger in the campaign, but on a low magic world the differance isn't that great... and the TBS guy sure dev crits more, which was it's purpose.<br><br>happy gaming <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
