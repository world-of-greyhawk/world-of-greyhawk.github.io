Well, I saw there were no Bard/Assassins (with more than few Bard levels that is) around, so I decided to make one.<br>First I tried a Bard/Blackguard/Assassin (Bard/Blackguard *cough*), but sadly ran out of feats (and attribute points) - Power Attack (13+ Strength), Cleave, Divine feats (13 Charisma), Two-Weapon feats (15+ Dexterity), Lingering Song, Curse Song... *shivers*<br>After a long battle with my EditPad (and the pre-formatted build file) I had to admit my loss, and go with Fighter.<br><br>Introduction:<br>The Singing Assassin<br><br><b>Playable 1-40, PvM</b> -&gt; I remembered it this time lol<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Attributes:<br><br>Starting<br>--------<br>Strength     14<br>Dexterity    15<br>Constitution 14<br>Intelligence 12<br>Wisdom       8<br>Charisma     14<br><br>Ending (everything goes to Strength)<br>------<br>Strength     26<br>Dexterity    16<br>Constitution 14<br>Intelligence 12<br>Wisdom       8<br>Charisma     16<br><br>Levels:<br><br>Guide<br>-----<br><br>1.

i don't play assassins very much, but perhaps dropping con a bit to get more skill points wouldn't be such a bad idea.  you could get some points into taunt, for example, which would allow you to lower AC and create spell failure.  The lower ac would also allow you to have a better change to land those KD attempts.<br>Alternatively, you could forget about TWF, freeing up some feats and again allowing for more skill points.  This would also increase your AB.  with hasted 5 attacks per round, that is as much as a regular pure 3/4 AB assassin would get.  Again, the benefit is to land more KDs.<br>As an aside, the higher INT would also increase the DC of the Death attack a bit.  every little bit helps.  fox's cunning comes to mind.<br>i like the idea of using darknessi (the plural of darkness <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  ) instead of stealth skills.  it really frees up some skill points.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Perception is strong and sight weak.

There certainly have been a lot of creative character concepts in this recent week, and it has helped to ease the pain I had suffered from previous weeks.

Interesting build, and using a two-sided weapon.

If you drop Concentration in favour of taunt, then not only do you become vulnerable to taunt but you also become vulnerable to losing concentration when casting spells.  While the main use of spells here is for buffing, presumably before the fact I assume, i thought i should point that out.  Sometimes that impr invis is a just a life saver when you need it in the miuddle of a battle.  That was why I was looking for more skill points instead of shifting them around.  Also, as I mentioned, the DA DC would increase with a greater INT.<br><br>I know that HPs are important for all chars, but for some more so than others.  As as assassin, most of his tactics will use surprise and getting the upper hand.  If that DA lands, coupled with a few KD while in Darkness, you are looking at some serious damage dealing.  Hence the need not to worry about HPs as much.  But i guess it depends on how you play your char.  As a melee machine, HPs are very important.  Perhaps even worth dropping 5,6th level spells and swapping CHA for some more CON?<br><br>-c

Dropping Charisma for Constitution is a worthwhile choice. You would get 436 HP this way, which is just over the magic number 400 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Starting with 14 Intelligence would net you the skill points needed for taunt. You would have to drop your starting Strength, Constitution or Charisma for that, however. Starting with lower Strength means lower damage and AB on lower levels. Lower Constitution means lower HP and finally a lower Charisma means getting your Spells later. I guess it comes down to what are you willing to sacrifice on your lower levels to gain more skill points.<br><br>And yes, you're right about Concentration; it does do double-duty. But you're right about the nature of an Assassin character too. And somehow I feel that if your Assassin doesn't need HP, she doesn't need Concentration either <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Concentration is nice, though, because it just might enable you to cast that one Darkness or Improved Invisibility in the middle of a fight. And that may well save your life <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"><br>_________________<br>Now is my day's work done;<br>I'll take good breath:<br>Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of<br>blood and death.
