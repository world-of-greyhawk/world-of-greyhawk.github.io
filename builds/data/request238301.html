I need help! I play on a server that is mid magic (+6 weapons, +3 ability score, no immunities, no perm haste).  I was trying to rp a char that is an iron golem constructed to slay char's of the night(rogues, SD, assassins).  I have never played a shifter and I have no clue how to start this build off.  Is anyone interested in helping me?

We would LOVE to help you.  I love shifters.<br><br>What style of hunting do you want?<br><br>Do you want to have a HIPS Golem?  Druid/SD/SHifter<br> - this will allow you to sneak up on them.<br><br>Do you want to have a faster Golem with more AC?  Druid/Monk/Shifter<br> - Golems are Slow by nature, so you may want some extra Monk Speed to catch these guys.<br><br><br>Do you want to have a Golem with Sneak Attack Damage?  Druid/Rogue/Shifter<br> - IKD in Golem form is nice, add some sneak damage to that 2-20 punch and you are doing some serious damage.<br><br><br>For True Sight (a must if you are hunting Sneakers) you'll need 13 levels in Druid, or 9 levels in Cleric (Druid/Cleric/Shifter)<br><br>I probably wouldn't add any Wiz or Sor class to your Druid/Shifter combo since Cleric would be a better choice for another spellcasting class.<br><br>Your choices really depend on how you want to do your hunting.  I would suggest Druid 13/ Shifter X / Monk Y build.  That way you will have True Sight, a bit of extra speed, and some nice AC and saves.  Go light on the shifte rand heavy on the monk levels.<br><br>If you take Druid to 15, you can then use an Extended True Sight.  Might very well be worth it.

Since Iron Golem has Immunity Decreased Fire 50%, I'd suggest taking 2 Epic Energy Reductions in Fire (after getting your Construct form).<br><br>That should prevent any Flamed Weapon from hurting you.  Sneakers will have flames on their weapons most likely.

You'd need three Epic Resistances to Fire, actually. Darkfire does 1d6 +10 (11-16) at maximum. Against 50% weakness it's effectively 16-24 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>"And one calculates <i>time</i> from the <i>dies nefastus</i> on which this fatality arose – from the <i>first</i> day of Christianity! – <i>Why not rather from its last?</i> – <i>From today?</i> – Revaluation of all values!"<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 04/24/06 17:36</span></i></p>

Are you leveling up this character or starting at a given level?<br><br>If you are leveling up, then taking 10 +1 shifter levels would be handy.  (unlimited Basilisk form is nice at lvl 10)<br><br>More Monk means more speed, and you'll need it if you are going after sneakers.  Just take enough druid levels to get your True Sight (or extended true sight).<br><br>====<br><br>as for Fire Damage...  I think that the 2 Epic Fire Resist protection happens before the 50% vulnerability.  So the 20 points of protection happen before the * 1.5 damage multiplier.  So 2 feats would be enough to protect against the 6+10 fire damage.  Although.... I'm not sure if Flame Blade can be Maximised or Empowered for more damage.  *shrug*

Mirrordonis, <br><br>Make sure that you read the FAQs for Shifters so that you understand what armor/item properties will merge with your forms and how they don't stack.<br><br>Iron Golem has both Armor and Items that will merge.  Flesh and Stone Golems do not have Item property merging.<br><br>Do not take (Epic) Weapon Focus Unarmed Strike.  It does not help you when shifted.  Improved Critical Unarmed Strike will help and so will Overwhelming Crit U.S. (but I would not take that since you'd waste to many pts in STR boosting).<br><br>If you take 6 levels in Monk, you'll get your IKD which is nice for your huge size category.  9 monk will get your that 130% speed.<br><br>So, D13/M9/Sh10  would be a nice min level combo.  You can get construct shape @ lvl 30 <br><br>Try for D8/M4/Sh8 pre epic.  You'll get 15 BAB.  Take Monk levels at intervals to max your Tumble.<br><br>You could start with 17 Wis and still make Construct at lvl 30 (if you take all of your Epic feats for Greater Wisdom).  That would give you extra stat points to increase your Int by two for all those skills (tumble /spot /hide /MS /listen /Disc /search).  You'd also have 2 more points for Dex I think.

The problem with shifters is that they are so hard to get leveled up if you are focusing on a certain shape<br>_________________<br>They were all dead.

ya, shifters don't solo very well, but in a party where you have a tank, they sure do come in handy.<br><br>I like to petrify things via Basilisk gaze.  Works great vs undead (low fort save).  Or, you can tail spike things from behind your meat shield buddy (Creatures with DR will laugh at your spikes).   PvP are settings need to be taken into concideration here.  You don't want to impale your friend to often.  Optionally, you can hop into Wyvern form and flame a bunch of pesty monsters too.

Anyone interested in writing up a build for me? I wouldn’t mind taking more monk levels and less druid, just didn’t think of it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  I don’t have any interest in sneaking really, as I said I would love to have a power build but this is mostly for rp (still can’t hurt to have the best though right?). Main skill foci should be Discipline, Spot, Listen, Tumble, and Spellcraft. Like I said this is a rogue killer. Here is his story, not that many of you are interested lol.<br><br>	The Shimmering Juggernaut Golem<br> <br>If one were inclined to search the deepest darkest halls of hidden temples and great libraries across the face of Toril, one could find the story of the Shimmering Juggernaut Golem.  Many such Golems have existed before this one and many more shall be created long after its destruction.  As long as vengeance and revenge is bred in the hearts of men and gods, such creations will continue to roam Faerun.<br>	<br> <br>The story begins long ago, when an old brass dragon named Shimmer Sungazer laired in the lands of sand and heat far east of the known world.  She is considered a bit eccentric from most other dragon’s perspectives.  Her seaside lair is filled with items better described as knick-knacks than treasure, though she defends them as vociferously as any dragon guards its hoard. Shimmer considers herself a connoisseur of beauty.  She does not tolerate simple silver coins in her hoard – she much prefers gold for its rich colorful shine, but accepts platinum if the coins are artistically minted or extremely old.  She is far more interested in objects of art than in coins anyway, and particularly admires masterwork musical instruments and items of sculpted glass.  Her lair is an abandoned human temple – large and spacious, with grand columns, high ceilings, and fine sculpture.  She delights in quality music, but has no tolerance for second-rate bards.  Shimmer often invites bards whom she finds impressive to entertain her further by playing one of her many magic instruments.  <br>	She often wanders the beach near her lair, collecting odd-shaped pieces of driftwood, interesting shells, and flotsam from the shipwrecks that are all too common along that stretch of coast.  If she happens to see a ship foundering off shore, she immediately flies out (in her natural form) to rescue as many sailors as she can, bringing them to shore and abandoning them there.  This is how the great dragon Shimmer first met Harold.<br>	One day in late summer a titanic storm lashed the domain of the great dragon.  A small wooden ship tossed about on the waves far towards the horizon.  By the time Shimmer saw it and went to rescue the seamen, all she found were some broken timbers and flotsam.  Saddened, she turned back towards shore and went to sleep with the thunder crashing outside her temple.  The next morning, she heard a moaning and saw a strange shape on the sand.  Upon investigation, Shimmer found a man, a lone survivor of the previous night’s shipwreck.  After providing him food and water, she asked his name.  All she got in response was senseless babbling with some screaming thrown in for good measure.  After a few hours in the shade, more food and fresh water, and a good night’s sleep, he was still no better.  It was then that Shimmer knew he had lost his senses and prepared to leave him on the shore as she had many others before him.  But then, something pulled on her great dragon heart, and she decided to take him back to the temple with her and care for him.  It only being proper that all things have a name, she decided to call him Harold.<br>	Harold and Shimmer spent several years together, and while they never became lovers, they realized they were each others’ soul mates.  In time, Harold got better, but never regained full faculty of his mind.  There were some who would say Shimmer was not fully in control of her self either, but she cared for no one but Harold.  She found after a time that he had a wonderful secret talent.  He was very creative, and could fashion the most beautiful carvings from driftwood and glass sculptures from the heated sand all around them.  His vision and creativity more than made up for his lost mental capabilities.  As often as he could, Harold would surprise Shimmer with a gift of art when she awoke from her nightly slumber.  He also dusted and rearranged her treasures for her from time to time so that she got a chance to see and appreciate them all.  She even had a master painter come in and paint a portrait of Harold standing by the sea.  Harold crafted a beautiful gilded frame for it by hand, and Shimmer hung it proudly and claimed it was her most prized possession.<br>	As Shimmer prepared for one of her long dragon slumbers, she explained to Harold that she would be resting and he would not be able to rouse her, but not to worry.  Harold pet her and kissed her great scaly cheek, and she lay down to rest.  Harold went about his daily business of dusting and tidying, then settled down to his art, for with Shimmer sleeping, he had little else to do but craft more wonderful things for her.<br>	Meanwhile, across the lands, rescued sailors spoke of the wonderful dragon that had saved them from certain doom.  After a few drinks, they would tell all who would listen of her temple, her treasures, and her kindness.  It soon became something of a legend, with bards and tavern patrons alike repeating the tale.  Unfortunately, these tales reached the ears of evil men, and a guild of thieves decided to steal the treasures of this dragon.  After weeks of journeying, they found it - a strip of sea bordered by desert with a beautiful abandoned temple perched on a cliff.  With Shimmer asleep, they were able to walk right in and steal all of her wonderful and beautiful art.  As they did not attack her, she did not wake, and it was left to Harold to defend their things.  The thieves, cruel as they were, killed Harold, and left him where he fell in the hoard chamber.  Months later, Shimmer awoke from her sleep to find her hoard missing.  Roaring in fury, she went to search her treasure chambers.  That’s when she found her beloved Harold’s body, mangled and left to rot like an animal.<br>	Shimmer found herself in a whirlwind of emotions; anger, fear, hurt, misery, and an urge for vengeance all swam throughout her.  She created for herself a mercenary whose sole purpose was to avenge the travesties committed against her.  From iron deep in the earth, she created a golem.  The fire from her breath heated it as she formed the perfect warrior.  Not content with a mindless construct, she called upon all the great magic she knew in her ancient draconic mind.  Nowadays, we don’t see those kinds of magics – the gods have since banished them from the earth.  With gold and platinum coins from her bed, she fashioned hundreds of intricate magical runes.  With these, she covered her golem’s body, and created in him some semblance of intelligence.  She sent him forth with two missions: one, to bring back every item that had been stolen from her, and two, to find those responsible for the theft and the murder of Harold – and to kill them.  The golem, shimmering like a sun reflecting on the sea, set out on his great and arduous task.<br>	Over several decades, the Juggernaut Golem found and retrieved Shimmer’s treasures, save one – the portrait of Harold.  He finally tracked it to the outpost of a small mercenary band called the Flaming Fists in Fort Beluarian, Chult.  The Flaming Fists are well known for rejecting jobs they thought were of evil intent. Being based out of Baldur’s Gate and stationed at this outpost created many job opportunities to keep back the evil Yuan Ti.  When their leader would not give the Juggernaut Golem what he was seeking, he systematically killed him and his men, took the painting, and headed back to the temple on the shore.  When he arrived, he could not find his great dragon master.  Sadly, Shimmer had been ambushed and killed by a band comprised of mercenaries, thieves, and assassins, in the hope that with her demise, her juggernauting golem would stop killing their leaders.  When the Juggernaut could not find her, he rationalized that he must have done something wrong, and set back out into the world.  Knowing that he had retrieved all of the items, he accounted for the error with an assumption that he had not killed enough thieves.  This was the start of a rampage that has lasted more than 1,000 years.  <br> <br> <br>	Closing the last of the dusty tomes, you lean back in your chair and take in all that you have learned.  You now understand why this special golem, a Juggernaut Golem, born from vengeance and hatred, birthed in the flame of a grieving dragon’s fury has stalked the lands of Faerun so long.  This is why the Thieves’ Guilds hide in secret and take refuge in their shadowy lairs.  Even if there is no honor among thieves, there is a common thread – the cold creeping dread they feel when even the earth trembles from the steps of the Shimmering Juggernaut Golem…

In Iron Golem form, every item you have except for your gloves and weapon will merge it's magical properties into your form.<br><br>Effects (other than regeneration) do not stack.<br><br>So, if you have a Ring of Str +2, and a Belt of Str +4, only the +4 will merge.<br><br>A Leather Armor +3 is better than a Plate +1 since only the magical protection merges, not the base AC of the armor.<br><br>Shifter's equipement tend to be differse and can be optimized for an upcoming battle.<br><br>again, read the shifter faqs.<br><br>I'll see what I can do about rolling up a build for you.

Here is a version that I just rolled up.  Not sure if there is a simular build in the archives, but this one should do.  Construct @ lvl 30.<br><br>I decided to add the skill allocation to the build to help explain where those final numbers come from.<br><br>Stunning Fist DC should be 40 @ lvl 40.<br>Quivering Palm DC of 27 @40.<br>+145% speed from Monk levels.<br>25 SR @ lvl 38<br>Your AB will change since Iron Golem will be so strong.<br>You could substitute the last 2 wisdom buffs with CON but that is up to you.  It would reduce 1AC, 1 DC from stunning fist, and lower your Spot Listen and Heal as well.<br><br>I chose Blooded because it gives +2 Spot and +2 Initiative.  Luck of Heros for +1 Universal saves.
