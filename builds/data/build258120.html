I was cleaning out my files out in PC and came across one of my old build that I never released or fine tuned... so I looked to see if anyone has made anything like this but apparently not yet, possibly due to that it has multiple alignment shifts.<br><br>Also, this was originally intended to be Barbarian/Cleric/Sorceror combination, but I didn't like the end result due to that CHA is not high enough to be viable to have sorceror in the build. So I changed it to monk due to nice bonuses that you can get... such as 120% speed, AC bonuses(since barbarian don't have heavy armor feat).<br><br>Also, it was intended to have Domain of Destruction, but I wanted to increase all aspects of abilities that would truly make the build tough so I switched to Strength domain and kept War. One increases STR and another increases Dex, Con, Attack roll and damage, along with damage reduction.<br><br><b>-Story-</b><br>Long time ago... on the day of Blue sun which appears every decade, one child was born on this very day. Being born on that very day made him to belong to covert organization, similar to The Order of Dark Sun organization except requirement being that you must have been born on the day of Blue Sun.<br><br>Nothing is known about the Blue Sun organization, or its true name except in passing whisper and rumors... However what is known and a known fact and that is of Engine of Destruction. His true name has never been spoken and will not ever be known except by himself. Engine of Destruction name was given to this man by an ancient monk of Blue Sun.<br><br>However, to know how he came to this name and how he came to be, you must go back to the beginning.<br><br>As a child, he was always an outcast, always being picked on by other children of his home. This persisted throughout his childhood and teenage, but stopped once he reached adulthood. At 18, something terrible happened, truly horrible event indeed. A horde of rampaging orcs ran through the village, looting and ravishing every female found there, and this continued for several months until the young adult had enough, especially when the orcs took his mother. This extremely angered him and started to stir something hidden deep within him, something that only child of Blue Sun will possess, an unbridled strength and rage, the very beginning of his barbaric nature. No one knows what truly happened, but once it all ended, all orcs lay dead with blood covered young adult, all villagers feared him once seeing his extreme lust for blood and he indeed have tasted it.<br><br>He was cast out from the village and being disappointed by the result, he wandered the world for several years, using his barbaric nature to live until a monk came across a nearly feral barbarian. With patience and care, slowly the barbarian nature subsided, from that point on, he sworn to become a monk and use what he learn to control his true nature, to keep the demon within under control. He learned arts that monk knew, such as stopping the arrow with hands. All was well and happy until one day; a villager from the barbarian's homeland came and pleaded for his help. With apparent disgust, the barbarian almost threw this man out of the monastery but his master kept him from doing so and asked what he needed.<br><br>What the man needed was what the barbarian feared all the along, his barbaric nature was needed, so with hesitation, he stopped his monk training and came to the village's aid. Horrified by what have happened to the village, almost everyone lay dead or half dead, heart wrenched by this, he sets off to find whoever did this. Along his journey, he comes across man of cleric nature; the cleric joined him in the travels. During the travels, he taught the barbarian cleric spells and many more. Barbarian found that with cleric's spells, he can increase his barbaric nature to point of where he cannot be easily stopped, knowing with this and monk's teachings, he is a force to be reckoned with.<br><br>It took many years before he and the cleric finally finds the group that nearly destroyed the village, they were easily rid of between barbarian and the cleric. At the end, the two went their separate ways and barbarian desired to return to the monastery and resume his monk teachings. Once he has returned, the master saw how much he has changed and saw that he has truly found his true path and that he embraces his barbaric nature which makes him truly a destructive force whenever the situation calls for it. The master embraced the barbarian in kinsmanship and uttered “Engine of Destruction, now that is your name and only name you will ever use among your travels. Do not utter your true name from now on.... You have discovered who you truly are and embrace it. Welcome to Blue Sun order, we are born on the very same day of Blue Sun as you; we are one and the same.”<br><br>However, this is not truly the end of the story, but that is another story for another time...<br><br><b>Name:</b> Engine of Destruction <b>(Barbarian 16/ Cleric 18/ Monk 6)</b><br><b>Race:</b> Human *<br><b>Alignment:</b> True Neutral - Lawful Neutral **<br><b>PvM/PvP:</b> Not sure??<br><b>Playable Range:</b> Not sure??<br><br><b>-Starting/Ending Abilties-</b><br><br><b>Str:</b> 16/26 <b>[8 + GS I-II]</b><br><b>Dex:</b> 8<br><b>Con:</b> 10<br><b>Int:</b> 10<br><b>Wis:</b> 16/18<br><b>Cha:</b> 14<br><br><b>-Leveling Guide-</b><br><br>L1: Barbarian - Toughness, Weapon Focus(Graxe)<br>L2: Barbarian<br>L3: Monk - Blind Fight ***<br>L4: Monk<br>L5: Monk<br>L6: Monk - Power Attack<br>L7: Monk<br>L8: Barbarian ***<br>L9: Barbarian - Great Cleave<br>L10: Barbarian<br>L11: Barbarian<br>L12: Barbarian - Improved Critical(Graxe)<br>L13: Barbarian<br>L14: Barbarian<br>L15: Barbarian - Skill Focus: Intimidate<br>L16: Cleric - Domains: Strength and War ****<br>L17: Cleric <br>L18: Cleric - Extend Spell<br>L19: Cleric<br>L20: Cleric<br>L21: Barbarian - Epic Weapon Focus(Graxe)<br>L22: Cleric<br>L23: Barbarian<br>L24: Barbarian - Great Strength I<br>L25: Cleric ****<br>L26: Cleric <br>L27: Barbarian - Great Strength II<br>L28: Cleric<br>L29: Cleric<br>L30: Barbarian - Terrifying Rage<br>L31: Cleric<br>L32: Cleric<br>L33: Cleric - Epic Prowess<br>L34: Cleric<br>L35: Cleric<br>L36: Cleric - Overwhelming Critical(Graxe)<br>L37: Cleric<br>L38: Cleric<br>L39: Barbarian - Devastating Critical(Graxe) *****<br>L40: Monk ***<br><br><b>-Final Skill Points / Distrubtion-</b><br><br>(D)Discipline: 43(51), (I)Intimidate: 42(47), Parry 1(0), (SpCr)Spellcraft 10, (Ta)Taunt 42(44), (Tu)Tumble 41(40)<br><br>Total of 179 SP.<br><br>L1: D 4/ I 4/ Ta 4/ Save 8<br>L2: D 1/ I 1/ Ta 1/ Save 10<br>L3: D 1/ Tu 6/ Save 8<br>L4: D 1/ Tu 1/ Save 11<br>L5: D 1/ Tu 1/ Save 14<br>L6: D 1/ Tu 1/ Save 17<br>L7: D 1/ Tu 1/ Save 20<br>L8: D 1/ I 6/ Ta 6/ Save 12<br>L9: D 1/ I 1/ Ta 1/ Save 14<br>L10: D 1/ I 1/ Ta 1/ Save 16<br>L11: D 1/ I 1/ Ta 1/ Save 18<br>L12: D 1/ I 1/ Ta 1/ Save 20<br>L13: D 1/ I 1/ Ta 1/ Save 22<br>L14: D 1/ I 1/ Ta 1/ Save 24<br>L15: D 1/ I 1/ Ta 1/ Save 26<br>L16: SpCr 10/ Save 19<br>L17: Save 22<br>L18: Save 25<br>L19: Save 28<br>L20: Save 31<br>L21: D 6/ I 6/ Ta 6/ Save 18<br>L22: Save 21<br>L23: D 2/ I 2/ Ta 2/ Save 20<br>L24: D 1/ I 1/ Ta 1/ Save 22<br>L25: Save 25<br>L26: Save 28<br>L27: D 3/ I 3/ Ta 3/ Save 24<br>L28: Save 27<br>L29: Save 30<br>L30: D 3/ I 3/ Ta 3/ Save 26<br>L31: Save 29<br>L32: Save 32<br>L33: Save 35<br>L34: Save 38<br>L35: Save 41<br>L36: Save 44<br>L37: Save 47<br>L38: Save 50<br>L39: D 9/ I 9/ Ta 9/ Save 28<br>L40: D 1/ Tu 31/ 1 Pt left, put wherever you want(I put it in parry)<br><br><b>-Stats(All stats are naked)-</b><br><br><b>HitPoints:</b> 424<br><b>BAB:</b> 26<br><b>AB:</b> 38 (melee)<br><b>AC:</b> 22<br><b>Saving Throws(F/W/R):</b> 25/25/17<br><b>Saving Throw Bonuses:</b> Spells: +2, Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +4<br><br><b>-Purpose of Build-</b><br><br>The purpose of this build is to use all nice bonuses that each classes has to offer, there are almost a synergy between each, depending on how you take it. Such as for cleric's spells, they will boost barbarian's strength and monk's wisdom, effectively increasing their AB and AC. While with abilities such as WIS, it helps cleric's spells amount and monk's AC and along with CHA for cleric's spell bonuses(those that relies on CHA) and barbarian's intimidate skill for terrifying rage. And be able to defend itself pretty well(combination of Barbarian's HP and Monk's AC).<br><br>Also the purpose is to be able to create a build that can be really destructive with its own weapon while having ability to be even more destructive with spells. In which has nice amount of usage(or more spells to use) by the way. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>In addition to ability to be destructive, it should be able to meet any situation with no problem if you are prepared ahead of time. Such as for constructs, since your barbarian's strength may be of little use, you can put cleric's construct damaging spells into use. Or undead which are immune to criticals, no problem! You got undead killer spells too! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     Viturally useable in any situation, spells for any that is immune to criticals, and others, destroy with devastating criticals. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br><b>-Author's Note-</b><br><br><b>*</b> Human is usually my preference, however you can change this to Half-Orc for greater Strength. But you will lose alot of things such as skill points, one feat loss(which I suggest you take out Skill Focus: Intimidate) and bonuses to cleric's spells that uses CHA bonus.<br><b>**</b> The reason for this alignment is that it is more pausible to have in order for developing as monk then back as barbarian and again to monk which is explained in details in the story which gives you an idea of why three alignment shifts.<br><br>In addition, True Neutral and Lawful Neutral should be doable?<br><b>***</b>Three level in total for alignment shifts which is doable in my opinion.<br><b>****</b> XP plenty occurs at level 16 to 18 and again from 25 and onward to 40. I do not mind the plenty due to that once you reach 40, it is a build to be reckoned with due to all cleric's spells at its disposal. All of which easily can boost the barbarian's strength and health, and it also can boost monk's AC and so on....<br><b>*****</b>If server nerfed the devastating critical, replace with armor skin or epic toughness.<br><br>I suggest that you do not wear any armor that negates monk's bonuses... they are what will save your life. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     Along with Cleric's spells to boost that as well. Certainly a tough opponent in my opinion. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">     Anyway, if you want more cleric spells and level 9 spells, you will have to lose two monk levels. If you do not mind that, then replace level 6 and 7 with cleric class. Personally, I rather to keep 6 levels of monk due to free feats you get, ie; knockdown and improved knockdown. I know they are very late in this build, but in my opinion, they are worth it.<br><br>I want to mention that I have not throughly tested this build, but it should work well.<br><br>Any feedback would be appreciated! It probably still need more tuning to make it even better.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Anuis on 11/13/06 03:55</span></i></p>

Alternative to Monk class... Take Rogue instead, it will remove alignment adustments and give you more skillset to use. What is suggested is to max out the UMD skill so you can use arcane spells and other things that are restricted to certain class.<br><br>What you will get from Rogue is the following, Sneak Attack +3d6 which can be used in conjuction with Cleric's extended Darkness spell, Evasion, Uncanny Dodge II.<br><br>Also, in addition to that, you will have to move couple feats around and lose some in order to get devastating critical.... Such as Blind-Fight for Power Attack, and Power Attack for Cleave. If you want to keep Blind-Fight, replace SKill Focus: Intimidate with that feat.<br><br>While taking Rogue, you would lose out on Monk's AC, Monk's 120% speed, free Knockdown and Improved Knockdown feats. Oh and immunity to diseases.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Anuis on 11/16/06 17:41</span></i></p>
