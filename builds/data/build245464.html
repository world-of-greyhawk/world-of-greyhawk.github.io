Designed for PvM, Level 1-40, but should also be welcome in PvP.<br><br>The War Lord - Half-Orc, Barbarian-Mage<br><br>By Deborah Tyr<br><br>Concept: Ever wonder why, in medieval times, feudal lords were able to rule with an iron fist over their fiefdoms, inspiring sheer terror over their serfs and would-be foes alike? Meet the War Lord, who is an exemplary example of one such beast. The War Lord is a combat-slinger/rager, a half-orc barbarian mage, and would be the first of its kind to make a debut (in terms of the class combination), according to Pulse Cap.<br><br>While saves are somewhat problematic (could definitely be better, but by no means dismal), the War Lord can self-buff, having access to a nice laundry list of fifth (5th) level wizard spell-buffs to chose from (also, being augmented by still spell and extend spell, with spellcraft being maximized). Champion of Torm levels are of assistance here, but this character has essentially no divine wrath or other COT stuff to speak of. Rather,  this character’s strengths are good AB (with IKD), which s/he can further self-buff to the cap, with the ability also to dish out some nice melee and arcane damage. The War Lord’s hitpoints are also quite high, but his/her most impressive feats are Terrifying Rage, and the ability to dish a rather nice blend of different damage types, and for which this build has been designed. <br><br>This character started initially as a bit of a novelty, but I think it has merit, and thought I’d bring it on in for your review and comments. As always, I welcome your thoughts ~ Tyr. <br><br><br>The War Lord – Overview<br>Wizard(10), Barbarian(24), Champion of Torm(6)<br>Race: Half-Orc / Alignment: True Neutral (or NE)<br>Hitpoints: 588 (668 Endurance, +120 Raging)<br><br>Final Stats:<br>STR: 18 (28)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 16 (20)<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14 (16)<br>CHA: 6<br><br><br>Saving Throws:<br>Fort: 	31 (34) (37 Raging) <br>Will: 	20 (21) (24 Raging)<br>Reflex: 20 (24)<br><br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Traps: +5<br>Other: Darkvision, Barbarian Speed, Uncanny Dodge, and Damage Reduction. <br><br><br>* FINAL SKILLS (227):<br>Concentration 42(47)<br>Discipline 43(52)<br>Intimidate 43(51)<br>Spellcraft 42(45)<br>Tumble 20(19)<br>Heal 17(16)*, OR a skill of your choice.<br><br><br>* COMBAT VITALS:<br>BAB: 29, AB (max, naked): 42 (melee), 29 (ranged) <br>+2 Bull’s Strength<br>+3 Greater Magic Weapon<br>+3 Rage <br>--<br>AB 50, + i.e., True Strike (Spell) (or, AB 67)<br>--<br>Capped AB: 68, + 3 Raging<br><br>Note: Calculation Does Not Include IKD or the Beneficial Effects of Terrifying Rage.<br><br><br><br>* DAMAGE CALCULATION:<br>Mundane Long Sword: 1d8 + 9 (17-20 crit./x2) (15-20 w.

Power Attack <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">   <br><br>I don't like boosting CON just for the sake of boosting CON (seeing how you already have 500+ HP with 16 CON); I suggest you either leave it at 16, using the points for another stat or maybe Epic Save feats or somesuch; or get EDR.<br><br>I'd consider a level split of 20/10/10.

Thanks, Finn: glad you like him, and appreciate the compliment. Some good ideas, as always, from you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">      <br><br>May I impose on you to make the following edits? <br><br>1.	drop power attack for iron will, thus changing will stats as follows:  Will: 22 (23) (26 Raging)<br><br>2.	Con – that’s necessary, I learned from Mith on a different brbn build; con-mod dictates duration of the rage which, in this build is about 9 rounds, being a nice amount) (Also, fort but reason is rage duration, HPs just a bonus, albeit a nice one I must admit) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">       <br><br>3.	As to thundering, yeah, I kinda like that one conceptually a lot, too, but you’re right in terms of PvP; might be a bit more sane to boost fort save instead. Thus, maybe on the level 30 line, we can add in Epic Fort as an option, as follows: <br><br>30: Barbarian(19): thundering rage –OR- Epic Fortitude (for +4 Fort Save, and recommended for PvP)<br><br>4.	And while we’re at it, if we could fix up that cap <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">       (thanks, Finn). <br><br>While we're making those changes (please and thank you so much), I’ll give the level split a bit of thought; he gets epic brbn damage reduction at level 23, and a bonus feat at brbn 24; however, 4 more COT’s would give him +1 saves and 1 more feat overall, to take EDR and something else. I'll look into it,&amp; thanks. Appreciate your thoughts and assistance, as always (hey, in the meantime, we got those saves up!- thanks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     ~ Tyr    <br><br>p.s. Cha-6 – oh, yes, a +12 boost, taking smite AB up +4 – Yah!!!!

Out of curiousity, seems that I'm confused (wouldn't be the first time <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  ... what's the calculation on that?  I'm working on the assumuption that rage duration is con. mod., +3 rounds (which is where I get the 9-10 rounds from as in, 5 + 1-2 (Endurance) +3 (and why I thought it was worth taking con up) - but, if my underlying assumption's wrong (again, wouldn't be the first time LOL), and for sure, would change things <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  (thanks, Finn)

AFAIK it's 3(set number) + CON modifier AFTER RAGE!

The formula is actually 3 +C +R, where C = your CON modifier and R = rage bonus, i.e. +4 for normal and +6 for Greater Rage.<br>_________________<br>"We keep our Feast of Feasts, sure of our bourne,<br>                 Our aims self-same:<br>The Guest of Guests, friend <i>Zarathustra</i>, came!<br>The world now laughs, the grisly veil was torn,<br>And Light and Dark were one that wedding-morn."
