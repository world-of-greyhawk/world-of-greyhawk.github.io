This Medieval Marshall is based on the former, i.e., a law enforcement type character, and is dedicated to the important cause of freedom, liberty and justice. <br><br>This is a combat paladin with very good combat prowess, including the power of devastating critical, together with 4th level paladin spell access (including the holy sword), and is able to deal good combat damage.  Saving throws are a bit of a problem here, but are partially offset by spell buffs. In addition to buffs, the Marshall as a paladin is immune to fear and disease, and via spells can also be made immune to mind-effects/mind-spells, and also death magic, thus aiding in the cause of justice. <br><br>This character joins what will in total be four characters in my latest series, which focuses on medieval law enforcement; essentially, these characters have all dedicated their lives and careers to the causes of justice, freedom, and liberty for all.

Deb, you gotta stop selling!!  i think you would fare pretty well upt nort selling snow to us canadians in december, eh??! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>I see 2 tyr builds and go  WEE!!  then i see they are nothing special.  Yes it is a dev crit pally/wm.  THe most important rule in marketing is the answer to the question, "can anyone else do that?"   if it is yes, you failed.   IMVHO you should just make a decision on what you want to make!  Yes, we all have variants, but we throw those out!  We dont post em <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif"> <br><br>From what you have been doin lately, it is hard to believe that you are NOT gunning for the most ever builds by an epic builder.   IMHO QUALITY &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; QUANTITY.    The question becomes when you do things like this, is why stop?   Why make a pal 5 and pal 15 variant, but not a pal 8 and a  pal 12 (if those are the spell lv splits).   THEN why not a cot 4 cot 8 cot 10 cot 14 variant.!  Oh wait!! YOu can do the wm7 and...  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cry.gif">    Then with one build you will be the build CHAMP <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">    <br><br>I guess I am dissappointed in that you hide a mediocre build in numbers!  48ab +++++  with +6taunt +4 smite gives you 800 ab.. what??   It is unnecessary.  simply saying 48 ab is enough.  We are all intelligent. We know that if you use +5 wpn you get a 53 ab (if i can add <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  )  All this +6 taunt stuff..  yes taunt is a skill but try it on a caster!!  OOPS!  Or try it on an pvper who fights vs casters.   all of a sudden you aint got shiznit.    Just my two cents.<br><br>I long for the day when we are unafraid to put a build out there and let it stand as is.  NO selling.  <br><br>BTW, if you want to see a pal/wm I love this one : <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "239999", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>   though, like he says it may be hard to do.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/28/06 00:22:49 (GMT) -- TyrTemplar<br><br>This post is for general information purposes only, and does not constitute a legal opinion or render any legal advice.

Avado: Nice to see you. <br><br>Ah, that Grim! I'm not going to get into a great grimmer build, which he had fun getting to the AB factor; that's a cool outcome, but as he himself says, not really playable. This build is playable. It also has dev crit, and naturally has DC 40 factor; it also has some great spell access, including the holy sword. It does all of this, with some decent saves (when you factor in natural pally immunities, and spell buffs, which *includes* death magic immunity, while also dishing out some very decent damage (note: edit, just sent off a PM to grimmer btw, as due to cut-paste error me damage calc. is 6 points off; still, even 6 less, that's good damage, str. based, with dev. crit *and* the awesome pally sword which cannot be dispelled (as we know), and which slices through casters (as we also know).<br><br>In other words, as a combat pally, he can do what tanks simply cannot do, and that in turn makes him a good combat build, with a whole bunch of versatility. The other build, the enforcer, has even higher combat stats and damage, and while his spell access in turn sucks, he does get a first level spell: as in, protection, thus also making him immune, in combination with his natural pally stuff, a lot more versatile than other tanks. <br><br>I have explored numerous angles of pally, each with their own charm, and each setting out to do something quite different: here, we've a pally with dev. crit; there isn't a whole ton of them out there that's for sure (for those who especially enjoy RP, but at the same time want epic stats, they're gonna love it, I know.)<br><br>Like just about everyone else here, including Uncle Grim and Finneous, both of whom I do so sincerely respect and learn from, I post what it is that this character can do, as a result of natural stats, and then (and ONLY then, do I post the spells available to him, which players have a right to know about. This ain't no sell job, and as far as I know, except in da deep north perhaps, no snow in Canada now (though, in Calgary I'm told, being mountain, it can snow in August <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   Anyway, sorry if you don't like this one, or my lastest series it seems, which focuses on early law enforcement, a subject I've thoroughly studied and am fact currently writing on; for it, pally is def clear choice; I also wanted to create a dev crit pally (again, not exactly overrunning the guild are such characters; not an inaugural character, to my knowledge, but split not done either. I think that makes him worthy of posting). <br><br>Promise you next time I'll look into those 'dem clerics (or druid/dragon types <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    In the meantime, I wanted to do a pally with dev. crit - I understand that such may not be everybody's cup of tea, but for those who want a pally with dev. crit, with or without that awesome holy sword of theirs . . . OK, so it's not yours (and that's okay; but, c'mon, might as well say no combat clerics, or no characters that need an alignment change, or . .. <br><br>the splits btw are specifically chosen and important; pally 15 (for the level 4 spell access) and WM 19 (for AB), Cot 5 gives us the divine, +1 for an extra feat; the other character's split is likewise specifically chosen and very important (ie, for even more combat AB, FTR for damage and feats, with just enough pally for the level 1 spell access). Hope that explanation helps (and no snow, just a dev. crittin' pally <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>~ Tyr<br><br>(but me promises, I'll see about getting around soon to building ya a nice cleric, 'kay? we knows you like them (and also, i've little incentive to further study the pally after this latest series, having so thoroughly looked at it, from very unique and differing angles. What can I say: as a professor, I guess I just feels the needs to be thorough, oui? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">    <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/29/06 07:15</span></i></p>

Sorry deb.  I dont think you got what i was trying to say.   All I was sayin is that, when someone has to hide the meat of something under a TON of words, one MUST be suspicious.   If this build is as great as you say, show it simply!   I follow the KISS method.  Keep it simple...   When you cant hide it, then it is real.    <br><br>BTW, yes taunt is a nice thing, but I am not sure if you have used it on a pw.  In my experience with it, taunt is a waste.  For the things that you can taunt, they die to fast anyway, and the things you have no hope of taunting are the things you would want to taunt!  Then theres that nasty thing that provokes attacks!  Not too good, imho.  So puttin it in your ab stats misleads everything.  ITs selling (thats what I do all day so i know somethin bout it).  <br><br>Thats all I must say on this.    I am thinkin its ironic that its Tyr's paladins ... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cry.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 07/29/06 07:25</span></i></p>

Hey! It's cool: and Tyr's blessings, eh? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   Like Thax, you aren't much of a tauntin' kinda guy, I gets that. But as we all discussed on one of Mith's recent builds, when it comes to PvP/melee combat, taunt *DOES* work v. non-casters (as in, v. melee characters) -- this, because melee types do not generally train their concentration, which they needs to do to resist taunt (including, er,...this one). True, for caster types, taunt is pretty useless since those types train their concentration; however, casters don't generally train their discipline, and thus they be open to knock <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>Really, though: go checks it out; I'm too busy to pulls all the builds here, but you'll see that this is true so far as melee'rs do not (really, they typically don't), train concencentration; and so, taunt works (and I assures ya it does, in lots and lots of places in fact); but you're point as it concerns casters is quite valid and a good one (then, for them, we gots some other neat twix up our sleeve, and including that holy sword <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  <br><br>(thanks, Av: always nice to sees ya ~ Tyr<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/29/06 07:37</span></i></p>

Just one last point on taunt, being only this: concentration’s not a skill in which all classes are allowed to max: among the excluded are ... Weapon Masters! So, a good skill to have in PvP combat? You bet, but we do not, and are not, relying on it. <br><br>Avado: I knows you're a natural kinda guy, so for you, once again, and in KISS format (just combat/AB stuff <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     our natural, unbuffed, sleepin' naked AB is: .... BAB 30, AB +48 (NO buffs)<br><br>We gots us up to +15 AB buffs (pally), +3 AB Divine Wrath (with Aura. Eagles; albeit of short duration, hence break only in emergency, yes <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     Another nice feature of this build though is that, with our buffs, skills, etc., we can (w/o equipment) hit cap: ie., AB +48 naked, +15 buffs, +3 DivWrath (albeit short), +2 smite (w. eagle's, aura), +6 taunt, &amp; voila! AB +74<br><br>AB capped: +74 (combat); we breach this with taunt (+6 AB), and also smite (+4 when cha capped, for our smite attack); that's AB +84, when all is said and done.

One more error, for which I sent off another PM but thought I should also here corrects (sorry folks, but good news, it's in our favor <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">          It's the smite bonus calc, off by one when brought to the cap (since, 8 +12 = 20 (being 10/2 = 5 cha bonus, and not 4 as stated; as such, our final AB outcome (adjusted for the Cap): +74, +5 Smite = +79 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">         now brings on the taunt for an additional +6 (or, AB +85 total, as adj. and capped). <br><br>Or, if you prefer, toss the taunt points into concentration instead, it being a pally skill. Of course, you'd lose the opp to gets that extra AB (by lowering enemy AC) which, if it helps dem great smiters get the most mileage outta so very few smitin' attacks, just imagine what tauntin' does for a dev critter, which opp to dev crit is of course unlimited. Anyway, choice is yours - since, it be true, with unskilled concentration, we ourself be vulnerable to taunt(though, not from ie a WM, since they can no more max out taunt than concentration).      <br><br>Either way, it would seem that we gots us here a really cool combat warrior, a combat pally, with his holy sword (and other cool twix) in tact, &amp; which shows us that pally's sure got a lot goin' for 'em as a warrior-class proper: also, not affected by the fear factor or other such stuff (immunities, oh, ain't they grand?), who can PvP/melee, slice through casters among other nasty stuff, having the dev crit power, some really nice spells and other neat twix (not to mention the ability also to self buff essentially to cap). Me likes that; then, me also likes dem pally's <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">        <br><br>Oh, and one more piece of good news: as stated, there's one more to come, soon to join the medieval law giver/law enforcement series: checking out a pally/dragon combo, and will be posted soon. A totally different kinda pally build, yet still in the theme of our latest series since, afterall, it will contain ... guess what? ... pally <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">        <br><br>This way, as with the rest of me series, there's sure to be something for everyone: so, enjoy &amp; stay tuned ~ Tyr<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/30/06 05:14</span></i></p>

Should note, re: dragon, that's not RDD dragon, but a druid dragon - yeppers, as much as I love those red wings when they're all a flappin' <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">     (stay tuned folks, a nice pally/dragon is joining the series, so there'll be something for everyone in this series, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/30/06 05:27</span></i></p>
