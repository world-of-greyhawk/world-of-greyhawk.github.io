I have never seen it built but I have fought one in my PW.  It was a weird fight.  I won the first round with a dev crit.  We reset, rebuffed and went again for about twenty minutes.  Very hard to damage the build.  The shifter won the second round by switching to mindflayer form and removing my brain.  Which was . . . discomforting.<br><br>Cheers, Fernando, nice build.

I must say the risen lord and defender abilites complete each other very well, and I think your build is using these abilities at their best even more then previous ones, and it seems playable 1-40 PvM wihtout too much trouble at early levels since he doesn't get 8 to STR and CON like many shifter builds and has a good AC that helps despite the lack of uncanny dodge/defensive awareness before halfway though pre-epic.<br><br>My only concern with such a build is that your creature type changes to undead, giving you major weaknesses that can be exploited by the right character classes. The biggest examples I have are spells like Sunburst, Undeath to Death and Mass Heal (which I think denies a saving throw, but I'm really not sure...) and of course turning, even though most cleric builds are not optimized for turning a big mummified scythe-wielding 40HD undead dwarf who got up in a bad mood.<br><br>But it's still a rocking build though, don't get me wrong <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

@Saosin<br><br>The creature type changes to undead, but it is very weird, for example, negative energy does not heal you (so (mass) heal should not harm you, I have yet to test it because it could, then it would be 2 disadvantages).<br><br>About sunburst and undead to death... I found no wizard/cleric to test my build on PvP. But I bet they should be able to kill him really fast.<br><br>About turning...

Items granting you immunity to fear should make you unturnable, AFAIK. At least it's what happened to my vampire priestess on a PW I played on... undeath to dead is "deadly" though. My vamp got healed by neg energy and harmed by positive though, but I couldn't target myself with neg energy spells.

I just happen to be pondering a Risen Lord build myself though switching DwD for WM.  There is one build like this already but it has Dev crit so I changed a few things around.  Perhaps I will post it.<br><br>Any ways, where I play, heals hurt you and harms heal you.  These make great tanks, but healing can prove to be a major pain.  God forbid you should get caught in a mass heal when your cleric comes running in...<br><br>I like the DwD spin though.  Makes you nearly immune to any slashing/piercing damage.  Mind immunity won't prevent turning, but I'm not sure on fear immunity.  I thought fear was covered under the mind umbrella.<br><br>*shrug*<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/" target="_blank">http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/</a>
