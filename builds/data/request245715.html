Been gone a while. I think I should make my return noticable by requesting a build, no? Too bad. Here it is:<br><br>-------------------------------<br><br>-Level 30 is the maximum<br>-No Weapons or Armour beyond +3<br>-No Perma-Haste or True Sight on items<br>-Very few spells are capped<br>-Minimum of 3 levels per class taken<br>-No alignment shifts<br>-No attribute-bonus items beyond +1 each<br>-RDD requires 12 levels of Sorc or Bard<br>-Shadowdancer is dissallowed<br>-No Dev Crit<br><br>--------------------------------<br><br>With that said, I want a Blackgaurd heavy build. I have been messing around with a few but I just can't hit anything near what I was hoping for. I would like it to be a Tankish Melee Build sort of thing, capable of taking at least a bit of a beating, and definetly be able to dish it out. AC is not quite as important, but would of course be really nice.<br><br>I don't really know what I want the other classes to be. Fighter, Rogue, Bard, Sorc, Cleric... all work for me. Even Druid. The only I can't stand is Barbarian. As for alternative PRC's, Blackgaurd is the main that I hope for, but in addition, RDD, Palemaster, Assasin, Weapon Master... all are acceptable. Perhaps even others if the use is good.<br><br>I dunno. I am pretty much open to alot, because I just cant figure out this Blackgaurd class. I just don't get it. The Smite Good seems pretty bad because this is a PRC and you won't be able to get 30 levels of use out of it because there is no base class with Smite Good. Its summons are pretty bad too... <br><br>Any help?

Bard 12/FTR 5/BG 13 perhaps. FTR 4/BG 8/Bard 8 in pre-epic for +18 BAB and a full attack routine. Take EWS on a feat level in epic with your 5th FTR.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...

Gah! Nice timing Din. I just went out and tried to make a build, then I come back and a completely different one is posted! Alright, here is what I worked with:<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Human - Cleric 16/ Blackgaurd 10/ 4 Rogue (In that Order)<br><br>Strength: 14<br>Dexterity: 9<br>Constitution: 14 -&gt; (16)<br>Wisdom: 17 -&gt; (22)<br>Intelligence: 10<br>Charisma: 10<br><br>(Travel and Trickery Domains)<br><br>(Thinking of putting more into Intelligence for the Skill Dump with Rogue. As it is, there are simply not enough Skill Points)<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Cleric One: Toughness, Power Attack<br>Cleric Two:<br>Cleric Three: Weapon Proficiency Exotic<br>Cleric Four: Wisdom +1<br>Cleric Five: <br>Cleric Six: Weapon Focus - Bastard Sword<br>Cleric Seven: <br>Cleric Eight: Wisdom +1<br>Cleric Nine: Empower Spell<br>Cleric Ten:<br>Cleric Eleven:<br>Cleric Twelve: Wisdom +1, Extend Spell<br>Cleric Thirteen:<br>Cleric Fourteen: <br>Cleric Fifteen: Cleave<br>Cleric Sixteen: Wisdom +1<br><br>Blackgaurd One:<br>Blackgaurd Two: Improved Critical - Bastard Sword<br>Blackgaurd Three:<br>Blackgaurd Four: Wisdom +1<br>Blackgaurd Five: Epic Weapon Focus - Bastard Sword<br>Blackgaurd Six:<br>Blackgaurd Seven: <br>Blackgaurd Eight: Constitution +1, Epic Prowess<br>Blackgaurd Nine:<br>Blackgaurd Ten:<br><br>Rogue One: Armour Skin<br>Rogue Two: Constitution +1<br>Rogue Three: <br>Rogue Four: Knockdown ((Skill Dump))<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Mundane Bastard Sword, Full Plate, and Tower Shield:<br><br>-Attack Bonus: 27/22/17/12 (17-20/x2)<br>-Armour Class: 28<br>-Fixed Damage: 1d10+2<br>-Hit Points: 310<br><br>-Fortitude: 22<br>-Will: 22<br>-Reflex: 10<br><br>Same Equipment, Buffed:<br><br>-Attack Bonus: 50/45/40/35/50, (17-20/x2)<br>-Armour Class: 48<br>-Fixed Damage: 1d10+15 (Various Elements/Emergies)<br>-Forgot to Record Hit Points, Buffed... Decent Though<br><br>-Fortitude: 28 (Immune to Death Magic)<br>-Will: 25 (Immune to Mind Spells)<br>-Reflex: 12 (Evasion, if it matters)<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Variables and Changes: <br><br>-Knockdown comes late in the build but it absolutely doesn't have to. This was just a rough sketch at the build, and this amongst other things can be moved about slightly.<br><br>-I added alot to Wisdom naturally, because I wanted more Cleric Spells. Also, a nice Will Save doesn't hurt... though it was primarily for the spell power.<br><br>-Added to Constitution after, simply because Hit Points are nice to have at my expense. However, these points may be better suited in Wisdom or Charisma, maybe even Intelligence earlier own due to the gross amount of Skill Points.<br><br>-I like Bastard Swords, but of course, any weapon will work depending on your preference. You may be inclined to head the route of a wider Critical Range, or maybe with a Greater Multiplier, because with UMD you can likely can a Keen Scroll if you can't actually find a Keen Weapon.<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Advantages and Weaknesses:<br><br>Immunity to Death Spells, Mind Spells, and Slowing Effects is nice. It makes it so that this build has few obstacles to overcome until Dispelled, or faces with something that can beat it with brute force, which will be fairly difficult considering his nice HP and decent AC. The AB itself is also quite nice, and when coupled with strategies like Darkness/Ultravision or Word of Faith uses, the enemy will have little defence against a quick pummeling; one that can include Harm, a +5 Weapon to pass most DR, and the spamming of Knockdown (Which by the way is very nice with 5d6 Sneak Attack).<br><br>The DC's of his spells will be quite low, but usable in a pinch if you really must. The main strength in his casting is the amount of buffs that he can use and the duration of such. Only problem is, is that a mage with a few Mordakein's will strip most everything with a few seconds thought. Also, if an enemy catches you unbuffed or unprepaired, you will be toast unless you have a Greater Sanctuary at the ready.<br><br>Skills like Taunt and Hide/MS can be very useful for other tactics, though Discipline, Tumble, and Concentration are choices that I would put ahead of others.<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Possible Tactics:<br><br>When entering a battle, you should always be fully buffed, ideally. With that alone, you should be able to crush much of your opposition through your high AB, decent AC, and ability to take a beating. However, if you are in a position where you may be ambushed and do not have time to buff, you should be sure to have either Improved Invisibility or Greater Sanctuary at the ready for a quick escape, followed by a preperation for the fight that is likely following you.<br><br>While actually within the battle, several options are at your disposal. If you have Ultravision active, you can simply use Darkness and continue to beat your enemy down with a new advantage. Definetly something to turn the tide if the opposing person is dumb enough not to have some sort of counter/sight enhancment.<br><br>The use of Word of Faith is very smart. With no saving throw, the enemy is blinded/stunned (I forget which) and has their summons taken away. Very useful for fighting a mage using cannon fodder, as well as for taking the eyes right out of a fighters head. At this point, it should not be hard to butcher them.<br><br>With Haste, Freedom of Movement, Greater Sanctuary and Improved Invisibilty... perhaps even maxed Hide/MS, you can become quite stealthy and remain at the same speed, if not faster. These multiple stealth options come in great usefulness considering you have a 5d6 Sneak Attack sure to hit. Or if you want to be real nasty, all you have to do is run up to them at 'Super Speed' (Haste) while under your 'Blanket of Transperency to the World' (GS) and use your 'I Will Rip Every Hair From Your Body Simultaniously Widget' (Harm). There isnt much of a defense to a +50 AB running at you faster that you can flee from, while completely invisible to your eyes. Especially when it can strip all but 1hp from you.<br><br>--------------------<br><br>~And it is over<br><br>(Tips, Advice, Suggestions?)
