Hey guys...I'm looking for a good archer build that can do reasonable damage, some stealth, and maybe some good epic spells (warding and mage armor). Any possible way?<br>_________________<br>"Computers are like air conditioners; They don't work when you open windows"

But you might want to take rogue instead, they give you 8 skill points every time you take level in rogue. And you don't have to meet any requirements if you took rogue instead of SD.

Sorry Anuis but ya gotta be able to cast lvl 9 spells to get epic spells <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Here is the archer that's been kickin all yer butts on the epic build server.  It high high ab, high ac, epic spells, and is immune to crit.<br>To make it sneaky, just start the dex at 16, get 14 int and get 40 hide, 40 move silently instead of umd.  Though I think umd and the extra dex is better than sneaky if ya ask me.

Epic mage armor lasts quit a bit of time, I think it's hours/level.   <br><br>Epic spells durations are based on the Class they gain it from. 16 PM = level 16, so that is how long it'll last. On a level 16 Pm it's like 15 RL minutes I think. It's a while.<br><br>I'll post my Elven Archer with Divine Guidance:<br>It'll hurt about anything, even constructs, which allows for called shots even into contructs.

Evo's skeletal archer is probably the strongest pvp archer until the 1.64 patch goes gold. Then it might be a tossup between that build and the bard/RDD/AA builds that can dev crit with a bow.
