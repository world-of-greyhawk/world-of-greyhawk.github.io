You should probably divert a fair amount of your Charisma into your Strength to bring up your Attack Bonus.  As it is you won't be able to hit much at level 40 even with buffs from the paladin classes.  I generally shoot for 35 or better, before buffs.<br><br>Also you can't have a BAB of 31, so I'm assuming you mean that's the modified attack bonus, including strength and feats.  When you make your character description, it would be nice if you listed the things that you're including in your cummulative scores, as well as the true unmodified BAB.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Ythaniel on 04/20/06 04:36</span></i></p>

Also in the build template we like to include the actual AC, buffed and unbuffed.  Along with Saving throws and skills.  Otherwise its hard to give feedback.

Yes, please check the link Ythaniel gave you (also in my signature) and PM me all the missing information, I'll make the edit for you. You should know what I mean, you have two builds already in the index.<br><br><br>About the build: you are missing the WF feats (-3 AB) and EP (-1 AB). All that CHA is way too much, I agree. Drop some great CHA to make room for the said feats and blind fight or toughness or extra smites. Ending CHA at 30 is already more than enough IMO. I'd drop Iron will too for another pick among these feats also.<br><br>Starting CON 10 is way low, I'd start with CHA 15, CON 12 at least.<br><br>Instead of Slippery mind and Improved sneack attack I'd get two Epic skill foci, or one Epic skill focus and skill mastery. I'd consider Crippling strike a must, not a non crucial feat like you do.<br><br>Actually I'm not sure what HS brings to the table in this build. You are missing some essential feats preepic and taking more Great CHA than really necessary in epic, saves are already good by themselves, you already have UMD and tumble (plus a lot more) as class skills for rogue. CoT would probably be a better choice (sinergy with paladin and bonus feats in a feat starved build) or even Fighter for WS/EWS if the XP penalty is not an issue (and with proper lvling you can delay it into the epic lvls).<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 04/20/06 09:46</span></i></p>

Iron Will is a pre-req for Harper Scouts. As for what they can bring to this build, they have a stackable Cats Grace and Eagles Splendour, which is of great use.<br><br>Nice concept overall. I'll have to look more closely when I have some time. I'd be tempted to take Pally to 19 to get more spells though. <br><br>Either way it looks fun<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

Why do I always forget Iron Will is a HS prereq? *bangs head on the wall*<br><br>True for the stackability, Aura of Glory + 2 Eagle's Splendor will even cap CHA. Dex is less of an issue if wearing plate. Still I see the build as feat starved.<br><br>Paladin 19/Rogue 16 is better than Paladin 16/Rogue 19 also IMO, paladin's spell selection is small but full of useful spells.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 04/20/06 14:28</span></i></p>

This build wont hit those hardass creatures very as many others alrdy pointed at. so i guess dropping those Great Cha feats, atleast 4 of em and spending those on Great Smite instead, this will allow u to get a high ab blow with the divine dmg from all your buffs. The con doesnt necceserry have to go higher as the ac will b high enough with the divine shield + gear. whitch means the foes will not hit that often as they would without that ac and then, a good con would b to prefer. anyway, nice build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

With the HS pre-req feats, there's not much to do, HS really works well with a paladin, I've tested it, you buff CHA to max easily, +6 saves, divine damage and AC.<br><br>However, I agree you take too much Great CHA feats, you get more bonus for WF, EWF and EP for the very least, Blind-Fight and Armor Skin would be good too, you need as much AB as you can get, since your damage with sneaks and divine is already good, I would also start CHA 14 CON 14......<br><br>There's a slight error on the skills part at level 39, UMD and Tumble should be taken with Rogue, since, HS doesn't gets UMD, and Skill dump on level 39 even though you can take Tumble with Rogue is just wrong, for discipline it's OK.<br><br>I don't understand this:<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;PvP (only against Blackguard builds though)</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->You don't have bonuses against Blackguards, only one smite, and no Great Smiting while you're at it.<br><br>Yeah, I like it.

34 is a lot without enchancing items or spells.  Sure it gives you +12 divine damage when using Divine Might, or +12 AC with Divine Shield, but the main problem is not being able to hit things because your AB is much too low.  If you boost your strength instead of your charisma, you get more damage AND more AB.  Being able to hit consistently is more important than damage overall, because if you can't hit you can't do damage at all. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Ythaniel on 04/21/06 16:34</span></i></p>

I consider 26 enough, being the first even number after the requirement for great smite.

The problem with your CHA is not "exactly" that it's too high, is that you take Great CHA feats when there are better epic feats to consider (and of course the low STR).<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Divine shield is for some reason capped at +11.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>It is? so then the Character Sheet is lying to us again?

A couple of fellows on my server had tested it, and read about it in the NwN forums.

What's probably going on with the +11 here is you already have +4 dodge bonus from haste and another +5 from Epic Mage armor.  That's 9/20, leaving +11 towards the cap.<br>_________________<br>Vulcano's <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&amp;id=6522" target="_blank">Bard Studio</a> (in beta, 1.67).  *Updated*  Compose, play, and save your own bard music dynamically in game!

divine shield is dodge ac and dodge ac stacks but is capped at +20 what was pointed out already. remember that haste (+4ac) is also dodge ac and counts towards the cap.
