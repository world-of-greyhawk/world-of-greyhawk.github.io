heyas;<br><br>   okay, i'm developing a new character named dekia.  she's a battle angel.  these are kick-butt warrior angels who go out and smite evil.<br><br>   i was originally thinking the old fighter/weapon-master route, specializing in katana.  but then i thought, hmmm... paladin?  and my friend said, hmmm... champion of torm?<br><br>   the thing is, i don't know much about these two classes.  paladin i know has to be lawful good and they get those holy avenger things (which i only recently found out what they did, and they seem cool!).  and champion of torm is some kinda paladin/fighter hybrid.<br>   uh... and that's about it.<br><br><br>   this is going to be a pvp build.  her weapon is katana, as i mentioned, though i suppose i can be talked into longsword or something similar.  not scythe or anything weird, though.  strength build is good.<br>   as for the angelic-like powers, i'm not looking for anything fancy.  smite evil would be good, i think.  don't think i need to worry about undead turning.  maybe some of those holy/light spells -- or are those cleric?<br>   i'm not sure at this point about having and going up vs dev crit.  just to be safe, let's say that's in the mix.<br><br><br>   anyway, i'm open to suggestions, and your recommendations for how to put this one together.<br>   thanks, guys!

First thing: use pulse' search engine for pal/sorc/rdd's.  IT seems to be the combo you want (its hard to say since you didnt say specifically).   The thing to consider is IF you are pvp exclusively, DONT do good or evil!  If there are great smiters around you will be HURT (unless you are a good builder, and understand the classes you are using... ).   <br><br>Hope that small bit o info is worth somethin to you.<br><br>Peace

pal sorc rdd??<br><br>  er, no, that doesn't sound like the direction i want to go at all.  i dont want red dragon blood, and certainly not red dragon wings.  and i don't want to cast spells.  i want a pretty straight-up fighter type.<br><br><br>  i did search for the fighter/cot/wm and pal/cot/wm, and i found some, but really i dont know enough about paladins and champions of torm to make informed decisions about which ones would better suit me.  actually, i dont know enough about those to even be able to tell the differences between the builds.<br><br>   since im used to plain fighter, maybe paladin to start with the smiting and whatnot, then switch to cot for more fighter-like-stuff?  or just fighter-that-i'm-used-to then cot for more paladin-like-stuff?<br><br><br>   how about what's the big difference(s) between a paladin/cot and a fighter/cot? pros, cons...?

Paladin also gets the choice to get divine might and divine shield (feats), divien might gives divine damage = CHA modifier for rounds = CHA modifier, divine shield the same but for AC and its uses spend your turn undead uses, so you got several.<br><br>Paladin/fighter/CoT can be good too, the fighter will give you WS, with that CoT can get EWS, CHA based paladin + CoT = amazing saves, CoT also gets divine wrath, which lasts rounds = CHA modifier and gives AB and divine damage = CHA modifier, but with only one use per day.<br><br>One weapon or two weapons? katana is single and can go either way, but needs exotic weapon feat, a big greatsword or other two handed weapon can really kick ***, sword/shield for AC, or in the case you like the ccrazy monk APR cheese with two kamas, but doesn't looks angle-style.<br><br>This is what I know/recall/think is important<br><br>pros fighter<br>WS and EWS for +6 full damage<br>extra feat every 2 levels<br><br>pros CoT<br>+1 to saves every 2 levels<br>extra feat every two levels<br><br>pros paladin<br>CHA modifier goes to saves<br>can get DM and DS<br><br>Going with the three forgetting the XP penalty might be stronger.

Offensive melee power? Paladin16/fighter2/WM22.<br><br>Human with starting STR15, ending STR32. 50 BAB with no items and mundane WoC. Max STR from weapons and a +5 sword(or holy sword spell, or even GMW) 61 AB. Add Bless, Aid, parayer and Divine Favor for another 8 and you hit 69. With WM crits that's just plain nasty. Be sure to end the build with a Paladin level, to max Taunt. You might wanna forget CHA in this build to at least get the DEX 13, INT 14 and WIS 14 too.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.
