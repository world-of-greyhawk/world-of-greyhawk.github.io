Yeah...Start playing on a serious RP server <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Perhaps try spamming with non save spells like IGMS from a hasted epic warded sorc, or a monk based run'n gun AA.<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 08/21/06 10:11</span></i></p>

I might start looking into the monk AA.<br><br>However, the missle storms spells... along with quite a few of the other good offensive spells were nerfed into useless-ness.

Time to change servers!   I have heard this type of questin over the years and I cannot understand why people continue to play on servers that nerf everything.  The best counter is a good offense.  THe best offense is to vote elsewhere.. if tha makes any sense <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">

Try a cleric/bard/PM that should be tougher than a paladin/bard/PM and harm should cut through that AC.  If devastating critical has been disabled, you could try to out melee them with a cleric/bard/RDD, bard/fighter/WM, paladin/bard/RDD or bard/fighter/RDD.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

TBH... I prolly should change servers, but I've been playing on this one server since I started playing nwn 2 years ago, so I'm kinda attached to the server i geuss...<br><br>Another reason is cuz there aren't alot of ppl that know the difference between Noob and Newbie, and I really don't feel like starting on another server and being branded a "noob"...<br><br>Noob: Someone that plays the game only to aggravate other players, and therefore should crawl under a rock and die somewhere.<br><br>Newbie: New player that wants to become better and plays the game to have fun.<br><br>Though, if any of you guys know any good servers that might be worth checking out?
