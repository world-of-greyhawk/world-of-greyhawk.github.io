Interesting and different with an epic dodging stealthy paladin. <br><br>This is a build that is "born" first in the epic levels. This "stealth commando" gets his first stealth skill points at lvl 21. That lvl is also where he gets his weapon to focus in. He gets uncanny dodge at lvl 33, a little late for a dexer.<br><br>I can understand why you take paladin all the first 20 lvls to max BAB and get your spells as early as possible.<br>But I think it would make it a better PvM build if you took at least 1 lvl of monk and 1 (or preferably 2) lvls of SD during your first 20 lvls. Then you could play as a stealther almost from the start, and you could start wielding a kama early and benefit from the monk attack table. You would also have evasion and HIPS early. 2 lvls of SD will give you uncanny dodge, a must in any dex build when things get tough. <br>I think these changes will make it a build that is much more fun to play through the levels.<br><br>This build is a bit short on feats, and you use some epic feat slots to take regular feats like WF and ICrit. Do you really need to dual wield with this build? You get 7 attacks per round with flurry and a single kama. You get 8 attacks at the same AB if you dual wield without flurry and 9 attacks at -2 AB if you dual wield with flurry.<br>If you start taking monk earlier, you can get room for more epic feats by dropping the TWF related feats.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 02/08/06 17:47</span></i></p>

i leveld the build up in this way actually , weapon prof helped to use most weapons and i could switch between shield and dualwield preepic. takin 1 monk and 1 sd would drop the bab to 28. i took monk and sd lvls late due to multiclass penalties. <br><br>i think dualwielding works well cause you get another attack with full ab and with 10 attack sper round you even hit those with high ac and epic dodge(those guys that you need 2 20*ies for /round)..i choosed dualwield to make the dispell work for sure. with this build you can screw an opposing party in a few seconds.<br><br><br>1kama only is a nice idea and would free epic eats for more gr.dex and raise the ab this way , but your dmg aint that high.i made a different version using 20monk lvls and only 15 pally ..going with fists and using kama only to dispell.then hips and stunning fist.had empty body too tough and was immune to mind spells. think ima post it later...

Been toying around with the same level combinations recently, didn't opt for dual wielding, and using a rapier instead, gets an AB of 65 with full dex buffing, a little low on damage output, however Paladin buffs help! Generally aimed for PvP as well, so will probably put it into the heat of battle before posting it..
