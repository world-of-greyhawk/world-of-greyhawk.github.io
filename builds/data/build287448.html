Defensive Casting Mode allows one to cast without taking AoOs. However, there is a Concentration DC, which is 19 + the level of the spell you're casting (assuming you didn't take Combat Casting which lowers the DC by 4). So, with a Concentration of 28 (or 24 if you have Combat Casting), you can cast in DCM without taking any AoOs and without taking Combat Casting or ICC. Taking into consideration that you will be maxing Concentration whenever it is possible, it is safe to cast in DCM and totally forego CC and ICC.<br>ICC comes handy when Expertise/Improved Expertise are available, because one can't activate DCM and Expertise at the same time.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By rafa10pj on 11/27/07 03:25</span></i></p>

I think I took Extra Turning because of my high levels in Cleric and the fact that I could also damage constructs.  I figured it was worth is since a buff or two could give me extra CHA anyways.<br><br>I'll have to playtest the defensive casting aspect.  I think there was a reason... it just escapes me at the moment.

If I remember correctly DC is calculated as follows: 10 + ability modifier + feat modifier + spell level, for your 28 WIS that's 25 + spell level, so a DC of 34 on a level 9 spell (I've read that Implosion gets an extra +3 or something weird like that), if you can buff your WIS you'll get an extra +6 for a DC of 40, except that Clerics aren't WIS buffers like Druids (I just love Owl's Insight), you'd need equipment. That is a regularly good DC I guess, if I'm correct the max buffed spell DC is 48, you ain't that far, but it isn't astonishing either, just about any caster usually gets higher base scores, so "VERY high" is just not the correct expression, sorry Bromium.<br><br>I agree with avado, Storm of Vengeance rocks, it stuns great, it can deal heavy damage over time, and Evasion doesn't work against it, you should try it in your strategy as well, too bad it's conjuration.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

That would give you a boost in damage.

I'm not <b>that</b> sloppy, everybody is recieving the extra damage, examination shows no electrical vulnerabilities, that's why I sy it's strange, but I don't know if it's my server or something, it shouldn't, SOV is not changed.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 11/29/07 03:06</span></i></p>

The extra dc comes from Heirophant.  You get +10 to ALL spell DCs...  ALLL spell dcs!  That and clerics gettin what I call "pocket pale master" is why i have strayed down the prc road and will NEVER return.. Muhahahahahaha<br><br>(if you think clerics are overpowered, come to the mountain and I will teach you HOW extremely overpowered a REAL cleric can be!!!)<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Very nice build, and I see a lot of good suggestions above, but I'm surprised no one suggested dropping 1 Cleric level for 1 more Shadowdancer, so you get Uncanny Dodge.  That's about the only change I would make there.
