Here is an old build that I really enjoyed a few months back. It bears some similarities to a build by Cow Art, albeit those were unintentional, but should be pointed out. His build was there first. It uses anarmed instead of kamas. <br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117562", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>The real inspiration for this build was the dark stalker build featured a while back on Bioware Wednesday. I took that concept and modified it to my liking. I wanted to use a monk base as well as still maintaining epic dodge at the time.<br><br><a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_darkstalker.html" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br><br>Anyways here is the build:<br><br><b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM</b><br><br>Race	Human			<br>Alignment	Lawful Evil			<br>				<br>Starting Stats				<br>Str 14<br>Dex 16			<br>Con 10<br>Int 14<br>Wis 14<br>Cha 8			<br><br>Character Progression<br>1- Monk - Concentration 4, Discipline 4, Heal 4, Hide 4, Listen 4, Move Silently 4, Tumble 4 - Dodge, Ambidexterity<br>2- Monk - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Heal 1, Hide 1, Listen 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1<br>3- Monk - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Heal 1, Hide 1, Listen 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1 - Weapon Finesse<br>4- Monk - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Heal 1, Hide 1, Listen 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1 - Dex<br>5- Monk - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Heal 1, Hide 1, Listen 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1<br>6- Monk - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Heal 1, Hide 1, Listen 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1 - Weapon Focus-Kama<br>7- Monk - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Heal 1, Hide 1, Listen 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1<br>8- Monk - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Heal 1, Hide 1, Listen 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1 - Dex<br>9- Monk - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Heal 1, Hide 1, Listen 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1 - Two Weapon Fighting<br>10- Monk - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Hide 1, Listen 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1<br>11- Monk - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Hide 1, Listen 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1<br>12- Assassin - Disable Device 5, Hide 1, Listen 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1 - Mobility - Con<br>13- ShadowDancer - Hide 1, Listen 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1<br>14- ShadowDancer - Hide 1, Listen 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1<br>15- ShadowDancer - Hide 1, Listen 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1 - Toughness<br>16- ShadowDancer - Hide 1, Listen 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1 - Con<br>17- ShadowDancer - Hide 1, Listen 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1<br>18- Assassin - Diable Device 5, Hide 5, Move Silently 5, Open Locks 10, Tumble 1 - Improved Critical-Kama	<br>19- Assassin - Disable Device 10, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Open Locks 10, Tumble 1<br>20- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1 - Dex<br>21- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1 - Improved Two Weapon Fighting<br>22- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1<br>23- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1<br>24- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1 - Epic Weapon focus-Kama - Dex<br>25- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1<br>26- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1<br>27- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1 - Great Dexterity I<br>28- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1 - Dex<br>29- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1<br>30- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1 - Great Dexterity II, Power Attack<br>31- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1<br>32- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1 - Dex<br>33- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1 -Improved Sneak Attack I<br>34- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1 -Improved Sneak Attack II<br>35- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1<br>36- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1 - Epic Dodge - Dex<br>37- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Tumble 1<br>38- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1 - Improved Sneak Attack III<br>39- Assassin - Hide 1, Move Silently 1 - Blind Fight<br>40- Monk - Concentration 29, Discipline 29, Hide 1, Listen 19, Move Silently 1 - Dex<br><br><br>Level Distribution				<br>Monk	12			<br>Shadowdancer	5			<br>Assassin	23			<br><br>Final Skills				<br>Concentration 	43			<br>Disable Trap	25			<br>Discipline	43			<br>Heal	10			<br>Hide	43<br>Listen	39<br>Move Silently	43<br>Tumble	40<br><br>Final Stats	<br>Str	14<br>Dex	26<br>Con	12<br>Int	14<br>Wis	14<br>Cha	8<br><br>End result is you have a character with monk speed and many attacks a round (5 main hand, 2 off hand, 1 flurry of blows and 1 haste). The High AC and epic dodge forces a needed 20 to hit in most 1 on 1 vs. player or monster. The character also has many of the monks abilities with the exception of Ki strike 2 and 3, empty body, and perfect self. The empty body is easily replaced by the assassin improved invisibility. <br><br>Max HP is 384, min is 160 (12d8 + 5d6 + 23d6 + 80 from CON + 40 toguhness.<br><br>AB with normal kamas is +33/+30/+27/+24/+21 and +33/+30 offhand.<br><br>AC is a base of 30 with normal clothes<br><br>Saves are<br>Fort: 20<br>Reflex: 33<br>Will 21<br><br>Finally has a SR of 22 which helps, but isn't great against any caster with quite a few caster levels. Fortunately HIPS and Death attacks help with them, and they get shredded up by the kamas very fast as well.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 08/03/05 20:49</span></i></p>
