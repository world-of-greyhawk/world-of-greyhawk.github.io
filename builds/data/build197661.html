Skill point allocation if it makes a difference.<br><br>(Note: apparently bard song capability is based on Perform skill ranks + cha bonus, even though Tumble/Spellcraft AC/Save bonuses are based _just_ on ranks known, so even wearing armour with a check penalty or having a massive dex bonus doesnt mess with your Tumble AC bonus, so you could drop a point of Perform and put it into UMD if this is true?)<br><br>Obviously no Dev Crit on this build, not possible to get it + the 3 epic dr feats unfortunately.

Anyway, lets say it`s bugged and dwarden defernder/bards are a possible combination, I would suggests a few changes to your build:<br><br>1)First of all, try to get the most possible DD levels pre-epic (in the case, get 10 DDs levels before lvl 20). I don`t know if ther`s a particular reason for taking 4 PM levels at the beggining of the build. If there´s, tell me? If not, change them, put only 3 and take another DD level. This can raise up your AB.<br><br>2) Why 14 DEX? Only for Dodge? As a armoured fighter, you won`t need too much DEX, so you can improve another ability. Pick another feat, and put these ability points on STR.<br><br>cakerj

You don't lose any of the benefits of either class if you later switch to a different alignment.  So, this character just needs to change alignments during the leveling, once between levels 11 and 12 (from neutral to lawful) and then back from lawful to neutral between levels 39 and 40.  There are quite a few builds here that require alignment shifts, even on the Bioware Epic Character Builds page.  Many PvP type PWs give you easy ways to shift alignment, and it also doesn't have to be a huge shift either.  As long as he keeps the character right around the neutral/lawful border, it would only take a few points to switch alignment anyway.  This build is completely buildable.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 06/02/05 01:48</span></i></p>

So, he has to take it, and thus has to have at least 13 DEX.  So, we're only taking 1 point that could be moved, which would only be enough to boost WIS or INT to an odd number.

cakerj: Yes I am aware of the alignment change requirements, it's a pain, but it's not illegal on the character. Not bugged either.<br><br>Well, at least in that way... when playing with it becoming more lawful occasionally caused it to warn me I would no longer be able to advance as a PM not a bard or whatever, it got the classes confused on the warning messages, but still worked out.<br><br>As for taking only 9 DD levels pre-epic, the only way to qualify for DD is by having a BAB of +7. So I would need more bard levels to get that earlier, which reduces the number of DD levels I could have _total_. I'd trade 3 points of DR for 22nd level of DD for 1 BAB gained pre-epic.<br><br>Dex 14: yup, the only reason I took this was I had nowhere else to stick the last point to make an even number, and hey, there may be a time when you dont want to wear full plate. (Cha 14 would have cost 2 points due to dwarven racial modifiers).<br><br>Not dismissing your comments, just explaining why I did it the way I did.<br><br>Yes it is light on feats, thats a major problem of the build, can anyone suggest better choices?<br><br>Trading 1 point of perform for 1 point of UMD: I kinda suspected that, thanks for the confirmation!

-1 CHA, +2 INT and max UMD, which in my opinion is far superior to a weak level 3 spell.

You could also consider taking 16 lvls of PM to get epic mage armor and epic warding. Doing this you trade damage reduction but you gain a higher ac. With your original build you have more damage reduction but lower ac. So it just depends on which is the better tradeoff for whatever world you play on.<br><br>Personally I would go 14 bard/10 dd/16 pm<br><br>With 40 tumble and all the ac bonuses from pm and spells you will rarelly get hit and even if you do, you just shrug it off anyways. Plus your AB will be higher due to pre-epic lvling and a better bard song/curse. Also I would say taunt is a must have due to the average AB.

Hmm I was thinking about posting my own Bard, Pale Master, Dwarvern Defender, however it is not really different enough from this one to really qualify a new build thread...<br><br>...I use slightly different starting stats:<br><br>Str - 14<br>Dex - 14<br><b>Con - 15</b><br><b>Int - 12</b><br>Wis - 8<br>Cha - 13<br><br>This allows me to put more into Str, allowing a massive 1 increase to AB and damage, at the sacrifice of a few skill points! ...and 2AC from loss of Armor Skin feat<br><br>Also I opt for Exotic Weapon proficiency, to use a Bastard Sword and tower shield (maybe a Dwarvern War-axe if you'd prefer!) Ignoring the power attack/cleave option...<br><br>but that's really all the difference...well I play it PvM rather than being a PvP garbage can <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"><br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!
