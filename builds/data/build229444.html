If you go the 2hander path you have a chance to hurt through epic warding with normal weapon.<br><br>If you want more Bard for added playability, you should go Rngr32/fgtr4/Bard4. You would loose 2 FE's, but would get an earlier skilldump to boost saves and tumble AC. Note that from the time you get 3 base classes you suffer xp penalty, unless Bard and fighter follows each other.<br>11 favored enemies covers a lot, even player races if you go PvP'ing. He also has the opportunity to switch to shield and still keep his weapon feats. His Dex can reach 26 which will max AC in Padded to equal Plate. All in all a pretty tough PvM damage dealer. The save boost from Bard should also help a bit.<br><br> If you play him in the HotU, you should probably go Rngr21/Fgtr4/Bard2. In epic, take BoE at 21, then reach fighter 4 at lvl 27 (or 24).<br><br>This is how I would build a "pure" ranger. This guy is lethal, the offhand damage is awesome, and no, it doesn't come from sneak attack.<br><br>There you go.

now that is what i am talking about.  but 3 more bard would be a bit stronger due to tumble dumps along the way.<br><br>btw, since you get +20 from camo spells, you can drop hide at least by 10, still keep your strong stealth, and you can pump up UMD a bit.  just my 2 cents, but a good and strong ranger.<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   nicely done.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>“If you bring a Ranger with you, it is well to pay attention to him...”

Nice build, but how about monk instead of bard, just to get evasion. This will also give you some  more ac, if you ever find yourself naked, or with wisdon enchanting magic items. Could even take one monk level before 20, and get a lot of attacks with kama, instead of kukri.<br><br>If it is due to the UMD, how about rogue instead, and get +1d6 sneak attack. Or take two, so you get evasion. <br><br>I don't see the need for bard in this build, why do you?

A fellow Norwegian? I took bard for the skilldump in Spellcraft for +9 to saves vs spells. His saves aren't to good, and really benefits from that bonus. Bard has the best skillset of all, and I took it for skilldump. You also get the dump in tumble and UMD. The bard outdoes both Rogue and Monk here. You can take 1 level monk anytime and still get kama flurry. Monk pre-epic would bring a nasty xp penalty from the time you get 3 classes.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

I really want to fit harper scout in there in place of Bard, but it just doesn't work out... the spellcraft dump and 2 additional feats from not having to pay HS prereqs just seals the deal.  <br><br>Rnger 29 / B 1 / RDD 10 might work out nicely, especially for the two handed weapon model, although the skill dump changes a bit.

I believe Grim builds without Dev Crit, besides not going for it saves you a fair amount of feats which can be used differently.

I realise the bard spellcraft dump is good for saves vs spells, but with a large amount of dex based AC, plus tumble based, plus haste based etc etc, his AC is gonna get pwned if caught flatfooted right?  So would you recommend 3 rogue levels for uncanny dodge, bearing in mind I want to group PvP in a lowish magic setting? or would you just make sure he isn't flatfooted?

One level of Barbarian is what I'd recommend. XP penalty may become an issue, however, depending on when you take the level. With 3 Rogue, you're losing Ranger levels.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 04/26/06 12:05:52 (GMT) -- Ithacan<br><br>[...]Harper Scout, the only class so powerful it's capped at five. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    <br>[...]</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Nope. If you can't get anymore than 34 ranger max, you might as well get down to 32, as 33 and 34 doesn't give you anything. Ranger32/Fighter6/Asn2 f.ex. or ranger32/rogue4/Fighter4. Just be aware that his spell-saves need the boost.
