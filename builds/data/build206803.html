This build began with my desire to create a dual-wielding warrior who focuses on offense to a very large degree.  Originally, I wanted him to be dex-based, using light, accurate attacks to bleed an enemy to death very quickly.  My first horrible attempt at that concept was the Twinblade build, which was not only impracticable, but impossible to create.  I got some expert advice from folks here (thanks!) and started over.  In experimenting with how to fix the Twinblade, I realized that, in the NWN setup, the dex-based idea conflicted with the original offensive/defensive mix I envisioned.  Then, exploring a suggestion from grizzled_dwarflord and looking at Mithdradates’s Pillager build, I rebuilt him as a str-based fighter/wm.  This came MUCH closer to what I’d originally intended.  In fact, in reviewing the build, I realized that I’d gone too far… there was no way that build would survive any combat involving an enemy caster or a large group of enemy melee types (though it was <i>awesome</i> in the AoC).  So I backed off of the 100% offensive f/wm (who had 53AB while dual-wielding, but zero defensive capacity… I’ll post it if anyone wants to see it), and I threw in some Bard levels based on responses to Kaliban99’s Two-Fisted Weaponmaster build.  Along the way, the build acquired a bit of personality.  Thus, I give you<br><br><b>The Humming Hurricane of Horror</b><br>Fighter 10/Weapon Master 28/Bard 2<br><b>Playable from level 1 to 40, PVM</b><br>Human, Any non-lawful alignment<br><br>The Humming Hurricane of Horror (aka “Triple H” or “huhh?”) is a member of a distant and very solitary society of fighters.  Their training regimen ignores all external considerations to focus on mastery of their unique two-weapon fighting style.  They are characterized by their disturbing tendency to hum merrily while hacking multiple opponents into small pieces.  They wield short swords shaped almost like cleavers and use their great strength to simply dismember any opponents in their way.  A long-forgotten bard watching a Hurricane fight a group of his enemies from outside his ‘splatter range’ gave the society its memorable name.<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>Strength	16<br>Dexterity	15<br>Constitution	14<br>Intelligence	14<br>Wisdom	8<br>Charisma	8<br><br>Progression:<br>1 ) Fighter 1 – Mobility, Dodge, Weapon Focus (Short Sword)<br>2 ) Fighter 2 – Two-Weapon Fighting<br>3 ) Fighter 3 – Expertise<br>4 ) Fighter 4 – Spring Attack<br>5 ) Fighter 5<br>6 ) Fighter 6 – Whirlwind Attack, Weapon Specialization (Short Sword)<br>7 ) Fighter 7<br>8 ) Weapon Master 1 – Weapon of Choice (Short Sword)<br>9 ) Weapon Master 2 - Ambidexterity<br>10) Weapon Master 3<br>11) Weapon Master 4 <br>12) Weapon Master 5 – Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>13) Weapon Master 6<br>14) Weapon Master 7<br>15) Weapon Master 8 – Power Attack<br>16) Weapon Master 9<br>17) Weapon Master 10<br>18) Fighter 8 – Cleave, Great Cleave<br>19) Fighter 9<br>20) Fighter 10 – Improved Critical<br>21) Weapon Master 11 – Great Strength 1<br>22) Bard 1<br>23) Weapon Master 12<br>24) Weapon Master 13 – Great Strength 2, Epic Weapon Focus<br>25) Weapon Master 14<br>26) Weapon Master 15<br>27) Weapon Master 16 – Great Strength 3, Epic Prowess<br>28) Weapon Master 17<br>29) Weapon Master 18<br>30) Weapon Master 19 – Great Strength 4, Overwhelming Critical<br>31) Weapon Master 20<br>32) Weapon Master 21<br>33) Weapon Master 22 – Great Strength 5, Armor Skin<br>34) Weapon Master 23<br>35) Weapon Master 24<br>36) Weapon Master 25 – Great Strength 6, Epic Toughness 1<br>37) Weapon Master 26<br>38) Bard 2<br>39) Weapon Master 27 – Toughness<br>40) Weapon Master 28 – Epic Toughness 2<br><br>Final Stats:<br>Strength	32<br>Dexterity	15<br>Constitution	14<br>Intelligence	14<br>Wisdom	8<br>Charisma	8<br><br>Final Skills (Modified)<br>Perform	7 (6)<br>Discipline 	43 (45)<br>Intimidate	4 (3)<br>UMD		41 (40)<br>Tumble 	40 (42)<br>Spellcraft	38 (40)<br>Heal		42 (41)<br><br>Arranging the skills properly takes some planning, but isn’t too hard.<br><br>Final Saves (vs. Spells):<br>Fortitude	22 (30)<br>Reflex		22 (30)<br>Will		15 (23)<br><br>BAB (plain short sword, dual-wielding):  50<br>Base AC:  22<br>Max HP:  552<br><br>Damage Bonus per-hit:  13<br>Crit Threat Range (plain short sword):  15-20<br>Crit Multiplier:  x3<br>Crit Dmg Bonus:  2d6<br><br>This build has a TON of offensive melee power, but retains moderate saves (except will), moderate AC, and good hp.

Only thing I would suggest is maybe replacing some of those Great Str feats you take after you get Overwhelming Critical. After all you aren't going for the higher DC for Dev Crit.

The build is going to need every scrap of damage it can find, especially against crit-immune targets.  Still, depending on environment and preference, it might be worth dropping 2 Great Strength feats to pick up BF and Knockdown.  You'd lose 1dmg and 1AB, but that could be worth it.

I really enjoy Cleave and, especially, Great Cleave, while I've never been overly thrilled by Knockdown.  I know KD is more effective as a combat move... I just don't enjoy it as much.  Over Crit is certainly optional; originally I had Dev Crit (much &lt;3 for Dev Crit!), but then I found myself on a PW that doesn't allow it, so I ditched it but left the option open.  The 2d6 dmg bonus is nice, given how often crits hit, but it's not vital.  If you chose to give up Cleave (and thus Great Cleave and Power Attack) it would probably make sense to also drop OCrit in favor of Great Str.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;I'd say go Ftr 11/WM 28/Bard 1, taking Epic Wpn Spec with your 11th level of Fighter, then taking Bard 1 at level 38 to max Spellcraft, Tumble and UMD.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>The only way to take EWS is with an epic fighter bonus feat, right?  So I'd need an even-numbered fighter level after level 20, meaning I'd have to go fighter 12.

So, again, it's mostly just preference.  However, taking Exotic Weapons would push the feat progression back, such that you wouldn't have the full set of TWF feats until level 15.  Alternatively, you could push the WM levels back (taking all 10 fighter levels in a row), but that would, again, delay the benefits of WM levels.<br><br>On the other hand, you would get a bit more damage (about 4.5%) from the kukris, and a bit more still if you keep OCrit.<br><br>Thanks for the feedback, everyone.

Here's a Kukri version, keeping the Cleave/Critical feats as above (rearranging to get KD/IKD is still an option, as is taking Blind Fight if needed).  Taking Kukri ends up costing you the Toughness feat, which is not necessarily a huge loss.<br><br><b>The Humming Hurricane of Horror (Kukri)</b><br>Fighter 10/Weapon Master 28/Bard 2<br>Playable from level 1 to 40, PVM<br>Human, Any non-lawful alignment<br><br><br>Starting Stats:<br>Strength	16<br>Dexterity	15<br>Constitution	14<br>Intelligence	14<br>Wisdom	8<br>Charisma	8<br><br>Progression:<br>1 ) Fighter 1 – Mobility, Weapon Proficiency: Exotic, Weapon Focus (Kukri)<br>2 ) Fighter 2 – Dodge<br>3 ) Fighter 3 – Expertise<br>4 ) Fighter 4 – Weapon Specialization (Kukri)<br>5 ) Fighter 5<br>6 ) Fighter 6 – Whirlwind Attack, Spring Attack<br>7 ) Fighter 7<br>8 ) Fighter 8 – Two-Weapon Fighting<br>9 ) Weapon Master 1 - Ambidexterity<br>10) Weapon Master 2<br>11) Weapon Master 3 <br>12) Weapon Master 4 – Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>13) Weapon Master 5<br>14) Weapon Master 6<br>15) Weapon Master 7 – Power Attack<br>16) Weapon Master 8<br>17) Weapon Master 9<br>18) Weapon Master 10 – Cleave<br>19) Fighter 9<br>20) Fighter 10 – Improved Critical<br>21) Weapon Master 11 – Great Cleave<br>22) Bard 1<br>23) Weapon Master 12<br>24) Weapon Master 13 – Great Strength 1, Epic Weapon Focus<br>25) Weapon Master 14<br>26) Weapon Master 15<br>27) Weapon Master 16 – Great Strength 2, Epic Prowess<br>28) Weapon Master 17<br>29) Weapon Master 18<br>30) Weapon Master 19 – Great Strength 3, Overwhelming Critical<br>31) Weapon Master 20<br>32) Weapon Master 21<br>33) Weapon Master 22 – Great Strength 4, Armor Skin<br>34) Weapon Master 23<br>35) Weapon Master 24<br>36) Weapon Master 25 – Great Strength 5, Epic Toughness 1<br>37) Weapon Master 26<br>38) Bard 2<br>39) Weapon Master 27 – Great Strength 6<br>40) Weapon Master 28 – Epic Toughness 2<br><br>Final Stats:<br>Strength	32<br>Dexterity	15<br>Constitution	14<br>Intelligence	14<br>Wisdom	8<br>Charisma	8<br><br>Final Skills (Modified)<br>Perform	7 (6)<br>Discipline 	43 (45)<br>Intimidate	4 (3)<br>UMD		41 (40)<br>Tumble 	40 (42)<br>Spellcraft	38 (40)<br>Heal		42 (41)<br><br>Final Saves (vs. Spells):<br>Fortitude	22 (30)<br>Reflex		22 (30)<br>Will		15 (23)<br><br>BAB (plain kukri, dual-wielding):  50<br>Base AC:  22<br>Max HP:  512<br><br>Damage Bonus per-hit:  13<br>Crit Threat Range (plain kukri):  12-20<br>Crit Multiplier:  x3<br>Crit Dmg Bonus:  2d6
