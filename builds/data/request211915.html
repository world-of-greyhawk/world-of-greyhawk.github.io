And if you go strength based, then you are neglecting the stat for your AB, and your AB will suffer horribly.  If you want to go for a monk and have dev crit too, you may be better of with either going for lots of arcane archer levels to make up for your lower AB, or going for the RDD class to boost your STR and focusing your stat boosts on your actually AB stat (DEX or, if using Zen Archery, WIS).  High damage doesn't matter if you can't hit the enemy.<br><br>Steve

Perhaps leveling an half elven monk to 9 with balanced stats, taking a level of bard then 10 arcane archer levels, then 10 RDD levels, then 9 more AA and finish with one level of bard. This should leave you with around a 34 strength and an unusually high AB from the arcane archer levels. Play your cards right and you can speed around the battlefield just out of range of your target, peppering him with low-threat range criticals with a very high DC. You are bound to get lucky with rapid shot.

But doing the monk/bard/AA could work for you.<br><br>You can pump your strength if you really want the Dev Crit, but remember that most bows are typically capped with a +5 mighty (meaning +5 strength bonus to damage) and the threat range for a bow with improved critical is going to be 19-20 unless bows can have keen put on them (but i don't think you can). So I'd prolly just get your strength to 20 (+5) and call it good.<br><br>Next, as a monk you'll get your wisdom bonus to AC along with the normal dex bonus to AC. So, you can pump your wisdom as a main stat and take the zen archery feat. This allows you to keep some AC and also use your wisdom modifier instead of dexterity for your attack bonus while using a bow. This combined with the AA prestige class should give you some good attack and damage bonuses.<br><br>Brandon

I'd go something like Monk 8/Bard 2/AA 10 pre-epic giving you a BAB of 17 and 4 attacks/round. Up to you than if you concentrate on AA or take more levels of Monk for the useful abilities. I wouldn't recommend more bard levels (except maybe 1 to pump up UMD) as you will want to put most of your ability score into something other than CHA. Defnitely take at least 1 level of Monk to get Improved Evasion and max out your Discipline and Tumble when you take your last Monk level. If you concentrate on AA you could aim to end Monk 9/Bard 2/AA 29.<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

Whoops! I was mixing two of archer builds. I meant monk bard AA. Very little sleep to be had on planet Transylvania. Seriously though, monks make for rather boring low-output archers. Choosing between damage and AB is a kinda cruddy undertaking. Bard/RDD/AA or bard/SD/AA for the win.
