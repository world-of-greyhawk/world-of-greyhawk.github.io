I was just wondering what server everybody plays on?  What kind of character do you play on them?<br><br>Aventia – I have played Torias’s Rogue Archer, and his General Purpose Combat Character.  Today I made up Phrostbyte’s Dwarven Wall.<br><br>Neversummer 4 – I have not spent a lot of time with their Beta going on at the moment.  I have messed around and can tell that it is going to be a very fun server.  Builds there are going to a bit different because of the way the factions are set up.<br><br>City of Arabel – This is where I go to get my RP fix.  You probably wont get much above 10th lvl there.<br><br>I would love to here where you play and what style of characters you have tried out from the ECB Guild and how they worked out for you.
