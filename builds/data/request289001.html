LOL, Dev Critting Faerie, that's a good one Endalyor, so different from your usual senseless requests... wait, no, it is pretty senseless.<br><br>Start with as much STR as you can (14?), increase STR all the way, grab all Great Strength feats (I recommend several Fighter and/or Champion of Torm levels) and you're done. Weapon Master is good to make criticals most effective, pick scimitar.<br><br>Now really, you're not any new guy or anything, I've seen you around for quite a while, how come you can't do it by yourself? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"> <br><br>EDIT: Wow, your post got in the way 1 minute before mine TM, though somehow it's doubled... Anyway, STR is not limited to 28, starting 14 +10 for 40 levels +Great STR VII = 31, so you cn end with 30 and get space to grab Dev Crit easily with heavy Fighter builds.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/20/07 22:41</span></i></p>

I know you can get to 30, but then you need to max it to start, which doesn't leave you many points for anything else. If you want WM, you also need at least 13 Int. I generally prefer to set the main stat to 16 (12 as a pixie) so I can put some points into Con, Int, Cha (for Bard), etc. If he maxes Str in a Bard build, he will either be hurting for Cha or Int or Con (not enough points).<br><br>Also, the pixie is a tiny creature, it can't wield a scim. That's why I suggested kukri. I am not sure if it will wield even the kukri as a 2-hander.....<br><br>TM

Ok, good points, it's his problem wanting a Dev Crit build on a pixie, I wouldn't worry about the DC too much, there's no way to have it awesome high with those penalties to RDD. I didn't know of the pixie size, wielding a kukri would indeed be best then.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Errr....Thax? There's a slight problem with having a fey as a sub-race: that is that they can only use small weaps such as slings, daggers or kukris which really limits the weaps they can use.<br><br>They also cannot use armour other than robes, no rings, amulets or belts (theoretically the rings, belts and ammys would be too big for them.<br><br>Which is why, I think they have such high starting stats.

Fair enough, but not all sub-races are that bad.  Depending on which sub-race system is being used on the server you play, some can be quite useful.  For example on the server I use a troll gets +3 regen and a few other useful bonii, including holding a large weapon in one hand, whilst holding a shield in the other <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  .<br><br>Of course to you, most of the time class, race or even alignment restricted, but it all depends on your style of play.

Athas Reborn has Thri-Kreen, Half-Giants, Tari, Muls, Gith, Mindflayers and Genasi. All are fun to play, well, except for Kreen cause not being able to talk suxx. The existing races have been retooled as well. The whole reason NWN has such a devoted and long-standing playerbase can be attributed mostly to it's ability to be modified by the fans into whatever they want.
