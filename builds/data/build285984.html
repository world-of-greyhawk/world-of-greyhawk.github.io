It's good, +41 unbuffed AB is nice considering you have 24/- DR, however, you're not taking Epic Prowess, I'd lower CON to 21 for it, -40 HP and Fortitude won't be much noticed, and you know your AB isn't the highest around.<br><br>Now, in my experience with Dwarven Defenders heavy DR builds, taking Epic Damage Reduction earlier seems to be most playable (for example, a Fighter/CoT/DwD can reach EDR III by level 22, that rocks on playability), the thing is you're taking 10 CHA for Blackguard instead of 6, which is what any Dwarven Defender would take, which would allow you to bump your intial CON to 18, making things easier and freeing Great CON feats, but Dark Blessing is so nasty you'll get penalty to saves. You should drop CHA if you can find some equipment that grants immunity to mind effects where you play, I'd probably drop it even if you don't, your Will and Reflex are low anyhow.<br><br>Expertise might not be needed for such a build, since you already have Power Attack and Defensive Stance, so I suggest taking a feat that boosts saves, or Energy Resistance.<br><br>I'm pretty sure you ain't immune to sneak attack with Defensive Awareness, it's just a bit harder to hit them, you can't be flanked but you can still be knocked down, and I believe invisible enemies will sneak through like they always do.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 10/29/07 23:27</span></i></p>

One could also put the first 5 ability increases into CON and that would get it to 21, just in time for EDR.<br>_________________<br>"Hats off and applause to rogues and evolution"
