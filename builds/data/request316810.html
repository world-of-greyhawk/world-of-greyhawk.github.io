I've been thinking up a concept for a role playing server I want to start playing in again, but I'm a little unsure about how to build it properly.<br><br>The server has a maximum of 30 levels, and in order to multiclass with another primary class the character has to have at least three consecutive levels in the first class and then three consecutive levels in the second class to take a third class.  Levels 28, 29, and 30 also have to be the same class.  I think the best weapons are +3 attack with +6 damage (level 17 minimum) and best armor AC is +3 (level 11 minimum).<br><br>I would like to use the Wild Elf subrace, which changes the favored class to Sorcerer and has an additional +2 Dex and -2 Int.<br><br>In my prototype build, I started with 16 strength and constitution, and I was shooting for Thundering and Terrifying Rage with Great Strength feats.  What I'm not sure about is what to use for pre-epic feats.  Intelligence is not important as long as I have enough skill points for Tumble, Discipline, and Intimidate.

nwn2 is another forum.  Also, since bioware closed the mains here, i am not sure how much help is here.  YOu can try the new bioware social nwn2 forum for help.  Not sure if ECB2 is there but they do have builders on the forum.

Er... Avado, I see no hint that the request is for NWN2...  He does mention a subrace, but he tells us what it changes, which implies that this is a house rule.  Anyways...<br><br>Short list, given just a slight bit of thought:<br><br>Blind Fight<br>Weapon Focus<br>Imp Crit<br>Expertise (if you have the INT, which you may not)<br>KD/IKD (as above)<br><br>Maybe Power Attack and Cleave<br><br>Also, it's likely worth multiclassing, perhaps fighter4, for combat featy goodness, heavy armor, and Weapon Specialization.  If you're playing towards a certain level, where you really want the goodness to kick in, Rogue would finish it out nicely.  Both will give you an XP penalty, but I would imagine that if you are willing to play an Elven barbarian, then you won't mind too much.

The server is on NWN, not NWN2, and it has its own subrace system.<br><br>I may reconsider the low intelligence, as he will be an elf and even wild elves are not stupid.  He will at least have a decent wisdom so that he's not a "me strong warrior, me kill things dead" barbarian.  I could at least take advantage of the base elven intelligence bonus, which still applies.

Does your serve have any special rules for Terrifying Rage?<br><br>In my experience, the best reason to play a barbarian is Terrifying Rage, but my experiences with the feat have always come in a world where it's been beefed up a bit.  It's hard for me to say how worthwhile it is in vanilla NWN.  <br><br>That said, as starved for skill points as you like, it's really pretty awesome to combine sneaking w/ Terrifying Rage.  It may not be entirely worth it on paper, if the feat in question is unmodified, but it's something no other class can get, which, IMO, so long as it's remotely useful, makes it worthwhile.

In the spread, he still has 3 Barb levels to take in the epics. It needs at least 25 ranks of intimidate, which means he can take Terrifying Rage on levels 24, 27 or 30, but since the requirement is also Greater Rage (attained at Barb 15), he'd have to settle for 30 Discipline at the most. That means he'd have to take that last Barbarian level at 27, since at 30 it'd be Epic Dodge time.

Terrifying rage is unchanged, and the last three levels have to be the same, so 30 can't be Shadowdancer if 28 and 29 are Barbarian.

I just now found out that in order to take Shadowdancer levels, both the build and role play concept must be approved by a DM and then a quest must be completed after the character is already made.  If I prepare to take Shadowdancer levels but the character is not approved, then I will be stuck.  All of the active prestige classes require some sort of quest and/or approval, and the Shifter and Red Dragon Disciple are the most tightly restricted prestige classes of all, as they require Admin approval and RDD needs a minimum of 12 sorcerer or bard levels.<br><br>I really appreciate the help I've been offered here, so I should apologize for not having known about this sooner.

Elven Barbarians is a heavily contested and debated combo. Most just discard them for having too much flaws to suit the Barbarian class. In the end, it will not be as powerful as its human, dwarven or half-orc counterparts.<br><br>But I agree with Onion. Fighter is the most useful combo.<br><br>Stats starting like:<br>Str: 15<br>Con: 13<br>Dex: 12<br>Int: 10<br>Wis: 12<br>Cha: 8<br>I didn't bother to check if these stats are completely legal, but its an estimate. Int can be 8 if it has to.<br><br>Barb: 1-4<br>Fighter: 5-8<br>Barb: 9-20<br><br>Feats:<br>Power Attack<br>Cleave<br>Weapon Focus<br>Weapon Spec<br>Blind Fight<br>Knockdown<br>Etc.<br><br>Sadly, Mighty Rage that is the most powerful one, will likely be hard to obtain, unless you min-max to hell. And by the sounds of the restrictions, its not an action server.<br><br>If you don't mind some penalties (that they've made sure to make hard for you to avoid) then I'd also say rogue on lv 28-30 for Tumble mostly.
