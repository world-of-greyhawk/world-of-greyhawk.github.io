I'm not a fan of using all those feats for self conceal on a monk over level 18. They already get empty body 3x per day which is a 50% concealment.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Thanks for the advice guys.<br><br>The monk16/SD4 makes perfect sense... was just some bad novice character planning on my part <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>My first version of this build I tried actually contained 5 fighter lvls as you described syrath, but I found that when playing with the xp penalty (from being an elf with 2 non-favored classes) it was becoming too difficult to lvl her.

Ya I would go with what syrath suggested on levels. That would offer a lot of advantages over your current split. Like he stated already, it amounts to an extra feat, a much stronger shadow evade and a pretty decent pet. The tradeoff is less resist, your empty body and perfect self. I would even go with 15 monk/25 shadowdancer. 35 levels of monk gets you 3 bonus feats. 25 levels of sd nets you 5.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

16 levels of monk gives you unarmed dmg of 1d20 however .<br>Worth losing the 25th level of sd for imo.<br><br>Syrath

Thanks for the suggestions guys,<br><br>I agree with syrath about lvl 16 for monk's 1d20 dmg... pretty much necessary if I want to go unarmed.<br><br>How effective would that lvl 23 summoned shadow be? I've never taken SD lvls past 13 before.. and that shadow was absolutely useless in high lvls <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>What I'm thinking now is to also include the fighter classes again for the specialization feats. Make it a human 16 monk/19 SD/5 fighter. I'll try that, as well as a 16 monk/24 SD later today and post the one I like better to see what you guys think.<br><br>Thanks again<br>riwipe

Syrath would be able to give you specifics as he is a resident shadowdancer expert. The basics of epic shadowdancer is a feat every 3 levels after 10 (13,16,19,22,25), your summon increases 2 Hd every three levels after 9th, and your shadow evades DR goes up  by 2/+1 every 5 levels (15,20, and 25(which was another reason I suggested 25/15, but I completely understand d20 reasons)). On that not, I'd offer a 19 monk/21 SD split. This will offer you 4 epic bonus feats, a 14/+5 DR from evade, plus all monk abilities except perfect self.<br><br>Keep in mind you will have trouble with getting through any damage resist ove a +3 on this build.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Emrill on 09/04/04 16:45</span></i></p>

I just did some testing of builds, and the one I like the best was a Elven Monk 12/Fighter 6/SD 22 using kamas. I'll post that build in a new thread since it is almost completely different from this one.<br>Thanks again for all the advice.<br>riwipe

Small correction manual is incorrect on the shadow. If you dont take epic shadowlord it doesnt go up in level from level 10. If you do its level is equal to your shadowdancer level less 1. So level 24 can summon a level 23 shadow to his side. PvM this shadow is quite good its immunities and DR are pretty reasonable even though its AB, AC and hp are pretty mundane. This means that pvm its quite good, pvp where the player will probably know how to harm it its not that good. It will still take them more than a few rounds to kill it. Giving you the opportunity to do some damage, or run away etc. So PvM you can use it as a tank, there to fight your opponent while you backstab it. pvp its just a distraction.<br><br>Syrath
