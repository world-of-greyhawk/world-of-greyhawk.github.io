I play on a PvP server (DeX) where you craft your gear. We use a +10/+20 system where you can add +10 AC to each AC modifier (Armor, shield, deflection, dodge, natural) and +20 AB on your weapon (+20 disc on armor to compensate for KD). Also you can add the maximum magical bonus of +12 to each stat on items as well and +10 to all saves (Pure casters gain a +15 DC bonus on many spells to compensate for this, death spells can have DCs in high 50s). Spellcasters can also add two additional spell slots (for a chosen level) to most items. A major nerf in effect is the true seeing nerf, to get true seeing you must first obtain either 85 spot or 100 listen before casting the true seeing spell for it to work and then cast true seeing. If you dont have 85 spot or 100 listen at the time of casting, true seeing will be cast as see invisibility.<br><br>Now, I am wondering. All of you people that DON'T play on DeX (If you play on DeX don't reply O.o) what kinda build would you make if you played here?

If I was playing there and wanted to take advantage of all this, then I'd make a wizard/rogue.
