It seems as if everyone agrees that the sorcerer is the best spellcasting class there is - I'd like someone to explain exactly why.<br><br>I made a Druid build and posted it <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "187089", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>My question is why shouldn't this be able to beat the "Exalted Sorcerer"?<br><br>Assuming both chars enter the battle with basic gear – the druid with a simple outfit and a longbow, the sorcerer with a full plate/tower shield and a longsword.

The sorcerer is the best spellcaster and this is why:<br><br>1. The sorcerer has more defensive capabilities. Globes of Invulnerability, Shadow Shield, and the most importantly of all Spell Mantles. The only spells a druid has to stop some spells is death ward and spell resistance.<br>2. Dispelling is easy for Sorcerers. Spell Breach, Greater Spell Breach, and the grand daddy of them all Mordikens Disjunction. All a druid can do is cast dispel or greater dispel and hope that it will do something which it won't.<br>3. The offensive capabilities of a sorcerer are vast superior to a Druid. IGMS and Horrid wilting is pretty much all they would need to take out a Druid.<br><br>Druids spells are best at improving shapes that they shift into. They are good for buffing purposes. The same can be said about a Cleric. They are mostly good for buffing up themselves for physical attacks whether it be melee or ranged.<br><br>Now it comes down to Wizard vs. Sorcerer and the Sorcerer wins because of adaptability. Wizards have to memorize spells before hand. So say they have 4 Greater spell mantles and 4 IGMS. The Sorcerer has 8 spells also but they can cast any combination of the two spells as they see fit to the situation. If 5 spell mantles are needed to be cast the wizard is out of luck and starts taking damage. The sorcerer on the other hand can cast 5 mantles.<br><br>Also combining sorcerer with 1 class lvl of paladin makes it not so easy to Dev Crit. A wizard would have to take a few fortitude feats to accomplish the same effect.<br><br>That's basically it in a nutshell. There are surely more reasons but I think I pointed out the basics.

Comes down to how you play, really.  A sorcerer is a Spamhaus of damage.  My Sorcerer, at lvl26, could throw over 30 differently metamagic'd IGMS's; a LOT of icestorms; and STILL had a few casts left over on all the levels to rebuff.    OR; change tack mid-fight to cast a dozen timestops while flaying the crud out of the mob ahead.<br>BUT, anything requiring a save is a problem, since A) CHA is not a bonus feat for sorcerer; B) Sorcerer's get a LOT less feats than wizards.<br>A wizard, on the other hand, tends to play the 'lose dc check' game; and can prepare for any situation on hand.<br>Not only that, INT is a bonus feat for Wiz; and a well-planned build can actually include epic focus in two or more schools (meaning you gain +6 to the dc for BOTH schools).

I'm well aware that a couple maximized IGMS can kill a lot of things, but the sorcerer knows a pretty limited amount of spells.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; 1.

A Wizard with the same amount of INT as a Sorcerer's CHA will have exactly 2 less casts per level [wiz base slots = 4 per level at lvl20; sorcerer base casts = 6 at lvl20].

Hmm... ok; my math must be bad.  I count a difference of 8 casts [for an avg dmg of around 1600 hp or so].. if the wizard hampers themself and maxes on one spell for all those levels with metamagic castings.  <br>However; a sorcer can change tack *click* like that.  A wiz must find somewhere safe to rest, re-organise spells; rest.  Then and only then can they change tack.  Or, sure mix the slots - as normal wiz does - and have less of each per rest, nothing wrong with that.

A sorcerer should beat a wizard any day of the week hands down if you know what you are doing. And as far as druids having just as powerful spells as sorcerer is crap. Every single spell a druid can cast at a sorcerer can be stopped by a mantle. A druid can do nothing to stop say IGMS or Horrid Wilting. Go to any decent server and most pvp players that use casters use sorcerers.<br><br>The only thing wizards are good for is PvM or they are really good if you are going to make a sneaker caster. Since they get a whole lot more skill points you can make a pretty effective wizard/rogue/sd with an impressive hide/ms.

if the server has tweaked true seeing, then the wizard is the best spellcaster. It is easy to make a good 38wiz/1ranger/1monk, which has insane hide and max DC on a FoD. 1 spell is enough with such a build. using SD is even....more devastating..!

Just my two cents: everyone acts like sorcerers don't get enough spell options, but really, since 80% of the spells are crap, it shouldn't be an issue. I generally find myself with two options for the last spell slot at any given level:<br>crap spell I'll never use 1<br>and<br>crap spell I'll never use 2.<br>The good stuff's spread out pretty well. You can get your buffs at lower levels, add in a few direct damage spells in the mid-levels, and top it off with all the good high level spells, and still have some room left for a few fun spells.<br>There really aren't that many good higher level spells, after all. Sure they sound nice, but if you know what's effective and what isn't, you suddenly find yourself with all the spells you'll ever need.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

I agree with that last post. Most spells are crap. If you know what you are doing a Sorcerer can get all the spells it needs.<br><br>And yes I have been hit with creeping doom in pvp. All you do is dispel the area. Actually you don't even have to do that. You will kill the Druid long before creeping doom does enough damage to even have an effect. Trying to kill someone with creeping doom is like trying to kill someone with storm of vengence.<br><br>And spell resistance is only good against people that don't know what they are doing. My shifter which only has 29 lvls of druid can get through the spell resistance of a lvl 38 druid or lvl 38 cleric because I took all the spell penetration feats. A lvl 38 sorc would have no problem whatsoever beating that sr. I say 38 lvls because most people combine those classes with say 1 monk/1 rouge.

I can vouch for that.

The spell clarity takes care of any dazing effects that SoV can cause and or that matter most servers have items that give mind immunity.<br><br>Also you must be crazy if you think a naked druid can beat a naked sorc. I have never in my life seen a battle casting druid and there are reasons for that. They just simply can't cut it. You need to build a lvl 40 druid and take on a lvl 40 sorc and the sorc will completly destroy the druid. Of course make sure you battle PvP because AI is for crap.

All true, however I would still say if the druid could survive for a short while he would eventually win - in most cases however a quick mord.disj. and a couple of IGMS would probably kill him - still I'd like to test it.

Well...druid/wizard or any other mixed caster class used to be popular before the 1.65 or 1.64 patch (one of them anyway), in which spell penetration was changed to run off caster level not character level as it had been prior to this.<br><br>That essentially meant that a near pure class caster (i.e Sorc 38 paladin 1 monk 1) became the stronges type of pvp build, because the spell penetration was that of a high level caster.  Wheras druid 14 wizard 24 monk 2 for example would now only be casting wizard spells with the penetration of a lv 24 wizard and druid spells as a lv 14 druid, before the fix was made that wizard/druid would be casting all the spells as a lv 40 caster.<br><br>Hope that makes sense.

I see your point on spell penetration. Dragon Kin is not as strong a caster as a lvl 40 mage. <br>But it has a strong melee attack, good buffs, lots of hitpoints, dragon breath, epic spells and 2 or 3 companions.

Evasion will only help to halve the damage so it could still be pretty high ~ 50 elemental damage.

everyone seams to have fergotten the 2 most important abilities of the druid. summons wich take a LOT off the dmg done by those IGMS couse the missiles split between all 3 of them (including familiar here) and the best of all - druids can heal. you can throw as much dmg spells as you want but he can heal himself and even the summons so it makes you kinda dumblooking while you cast spells.<br>_________________<br>Yours truly<br><br>Nurse Carla<br>Vallaya<br>Gotrek Gurnison<br>Isha<br>Aventia player

Huh, haven't seen this topic before... <br><br>I suppose you're too extreme into considering one overall better than another, an unprepared Sorcerer can die at a single Finger of Death by a Druid or get stunned for life by Storm of Vengeance, has worked several times, but so does a Druid intantly die against Sorcerer with Wail of Banshee and needless to say Time Stop rules for any PvP purposes, that gives a great edge for Sorcerer/Wizard.<br><br>Both classes have tricks at any rate, Druid summons are indeed bothersome, the Animal Companion is much stronger than the Familiar, Druid have some good spells tough Greater Spell Mantle is regularly enough as a Sorcerer to defend. Sorcerers have very good damage elements with Isaac's Greater Missile Storm or Horrid Wilting which deals magic damage, Sorcerers are better against melees when they use Elemental Shield + Mestil's Acid Sheath + Epic Warding.<br><br>Sorcerer vs Wizard is hard to say which is better, as in a pure build a Sorcerer would be better since it can cast any spell on its spell list, when multiclassing the CHA comes handy with Paladin and Blackguard saves but the Wizard gets handy for skills or when using dwarves (CHA penalty).<br><br>Cleric also makes strong casters you know... I often use Harm, Implosion and Storm of Vengeance, kills quite good.<br><br>Sometimes it's as simple as the one who casts the first spell wins, they all have at least one devastating spell that can make the whole battle, just check they've all got an instant kill necromancy spell, this may not apply to a pre-buffed battle, of course.

I actually prefer Wizards over Sorcerer most of the time, even though Sorcerer has a bit of more spells and is great for multiclassing paladins/Blackguards Wizard get bonus feats on pre-epic levels, which is also very useful when multiclassing, or simply put, to get more spell focuses... the versatility is good but not as useful as it sounds, it was said earlier on this topic that many spells per level end useless, so Sorcerer isn't missing amount of spells but also Wizard isn't missing slots for what is needed, in a real PvP neither the Sorcerer nor the Wizard will end their spells against each other, they will both kill rather fast.

I agree with Thax. And an Illusionist wizard is only slightly behind a sorc in number of castings. Not that it matters, number of castings is rarely decisive.
