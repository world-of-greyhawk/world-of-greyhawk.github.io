But I guess I understand what you're talking about, to make a build that seems to compete against both Grimnir and grlizzled_dwarflord's builds is not the best of ideas. Anyway, Grim's build is very different, so don't mind that, although grizzled_dwarflord's build is quite similar.<br><br>But it's quite a good build you know, it's weird to see that dwarflord's build is human with 10 WIS, this one has starting stats more to my liking. I wonder if the stealth is really working here, your DEX isn't too good for stealth, nor it is to wear a heavy armor... ever thought about Crippling Strike or Improved Evasion? you'll probably net more sneak attack hits with IKD than stealth.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/22/07 21:24</span></i></p>

Dwarflord is correct. Sorry I didnt get to explain it more in full detail this morning...had to go to work and my time on the computer is a few minutes here, a few minutes there. I wasnt so sure if I should post the build or not, there are a lot of similarities.

After I built it and checked the search engine for similar builds, I took a look at grims and dwarflords builds and thought if those two builds had a baby...it might look like this. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">  Anyways, I will leave it up to you guys if the build should stay or go.

I don't see any problems with it.  My build is a bit old and could use some revision anyway.  I like the stat spread and level split in this better, too.  I would probably try to merge the two together, and try to grab Improved Evasion over the ESF: Taunt/Intimidate (the Intimidate skill has a quasi-built in ESF for TR feat, in that you get to add 1d10 to the roll.  Couple that with your raw Intimidate and any other modifiers you might have, and you have a really nice DC.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Fin, I didnt think you were being mean. I understood what you meant. <br>Dwarflord, thanks for the advive. I forgot about the added 1d10 for intimidate on TR.
