This is my idea of the 'ultimate' Rogue build: someone who can utilize all traps, pop very difficult locks, find any trap in the game, and be able to use his skills, even in combat, without fail. It's somewhat of a concept/roleplaying build as well as an attempt to be effective in combat. He takes a bunch of epic skill foci feats, which (for the hardcore powergaming among you) can be switched for others if you choose. Skill Mastery is included in this build to get the 'take 20' in combat situations, as this is in keeping with the build concept. This guy would be great in a party situation, but should also be able to solo, if played with the proper tactics. I had a nifty little story to post with him, but it got nuked by mistake and I'm too lazy to rewrite it.

Cinn,<br><br>Nice build! Good practical choices as well as RP opportunities as you mention. Great skills and solid combat abilities.<br><br>Would you consider posting an Elf Rogue/CoT/HS version? I always like the Elf's Full Time Detect Mode for rogues. That, coupled with the bonuses to Saves that CoT provides always makes a nice combo. But I've never built a Harper character.

Excellent.  This combination of classes is quite effective for a variety of reasons, as Cinn demnonstrated with the ESFs.  This is the second Rogue25/Fighter10/HS5 I've seen here, and it looks completely different from the first one.  It's definitely a demonstration to the depth of the Harper Scout prestige class.<br><br>PS- something seems a little dodgey at Lvl34.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 09/03/05 18:22</span></i></p>
