Looking for some build help for a PW I am playing on.  I really want something that will excel in PVP.  I realize that no one build is going to excel vs all other builds but I need some help on things to try.<br><br><a href="http://www.gondorvsmordor.com/gvm1/wiki/index.php/GvM1:About" target="_blank">Click Here</a> for the changes on the world.<br><br>Important things are no dev crit.  Several of the big arcane spells are nerfed.  Bigby's don't hit as easily and have shorter durations.  IGMS limits how many missiles hit a target and is not party friendly.  Barbarians get extra attacks when raging and blackguards are fairly heavily buffed with much stronger summons at 22 etc.  <br><br>I have tried a couple different builds and been playing around with more.  <br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "310681", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> I think would do well except that it kinda sucks from 1-33 or whatever and most people have freedom.<br><br>I am actually trying Mith's limburger Cleric but I ran into multiple people my same level who could tank me forever due to not doing enough damage despite my massive number off attacks and +5 weapons with darkfire/acid flaring.  <br><br>I made  a 22/17/1 BG/Ro/SD Hips build dex based with expic dodge and lots of sneak attack and that doesn't seem to hit very hard either.  I assume I need a str based build?  I don't get how people hit so hard.  Some guy on our server was hitting for 80 physical dmg.  Log didn't say it was crit or sneak either.  How is that even possible lol.  Was he hipsing and then sneak attacking without the floating text?  He was so hard to hit too but was hitting for so much dmg.  (this is all occuring at like 20-26 Character level).<br><br>Are we allowed to request to buy builds lol.  I'm tired of wasting so much time playing with spreadsheets and reading NWN wiki and my PW's changes.  I just want something kickass I can level with.  Preferably something that can hold its own pre level 40 and isnt' completely horrible PVM.  I'd be willing to paypal cash for that haha.  My time is worth money to me ;D<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Calbrenar on 07/27/09 18:06</span></i></p>

I've also looked at PM builds and DD etc.  Near as I can tell something based on having high AC and popping out of stealth and dealing tons of dmg would be pretty ridiculous.  I'm not sure how people are getting the dmg they are getting.  Ranger + FE/Bane?  I know he wasn't smiting me as I am a neutral char.

I played on that server briefly 4 years ago.  Back then the favorite PVP builds seemed to be cleric/dragon builds similar to Kail's Order of Jormundgander, stealthers, and especially strength based Bard/PM/RDD's with a 20/10/10 split. <br><br>It's not just about the build, a lot of the best gear like the +7 AC items or the duergar shield or bracers are hard to farm solo, and probably the guys who are killing you with ease are better equipped.<br><br>If dragons are killing you consider making an archer something like Evodragon's bard5/PM16/AA19 on the build searcher.  If you are good with caster's, the exalted sorceress on the HOTU epic builds page is still one of the best.  If you're tired of being sneaked, make a PM melee; when decked out with all the right scrolls and gear they are nearly untouchable.<br><br>I'm not really comfortable trying to give you more than general advice, because I haven't logged on there in a long time and things might be completely different now.

I played the exalted sorceress build.  I don't know whether I just wasn't patient enough or wasn't playing it right but it just didn't work well for me.  I realize that once I get auto still spell 3 I will have much higher AC but the problem I was having was I couldn't stand still long enough to cast without getting demolished.  My only technique was pretty much sprinting around hasted dropping wails occasionally and then using bigby on the last guy or two.  I'd get caught in a corner and demolished.  And forget pvp i'd have to run so i couldnt' cast if i stopped -- dead.<br><br>I tried dragon build but its useless till you get dragon.  Not sure about bard/pm/rdd.  In terms of items people have some nice stuff but nothing ludicrous.  I have  alot of +6 etc gear myself already.  I know people use dragons to farm stuff but not for pvp so much (too slow).  I've tried some weird builds like 30 rogue/10 sd for crazy sneak etc.<br><br>I just want to know how he's hitting for 80 phys dmg.  How is that even possible without smite or tons of sneak?

As far as I know there's only a few ways to increase dmg right?<br><br>Sneaks<br>Crits<br>Bonus from Str<br>Bane of Enemies<br>Smite<br>Divine Might<br>FE?<br>Weapon Spec Fighter thing<br>Maybe some WM stuff

Max possible str: 56 with half orc RDD, 23 modifier, 34 bonus with a 2H<br>Epic Weapon Specialization: 6 bonus<br>2H weapon: 12 possible bonus<br><br>That's 52 possible damage.<br><br>A +6 weapon would be 58.  Beyond that, it would have to be Bard Song, some kind of spell (battletide, prayer, divine favor), or bonus weapon damage.

yeah I dunno what was happening.  I wish I had combat log.  He was regularly hitting for 80-90.  I think it had to be sneaks cuz I think he was hipsing then getting in a quick sneak.  I just don't know why I didn't see a sneak attack floater message.<br><br>I wish I could come up with a really good hips build they seem like they would be nasty.  I've been playing with various combinations of SD/Barb/BG/Rogue.  i did something like 22 bg (for super balor on our server which is modified) 1 sd and 17 rogue and it hit SO weak at level 40 i couldn't believe it.  no 90 dmg like he had.  Maybe need str based instead?<br><br>i also thought maybe str based ranger with overwhelming crit maybe ranger bard rdd?  22/8/32?  or even better maybe just enough sorc levels for true strike and keen, 10 rdd and the rest ranger?

Ah HAH!  Is it possible he was an SD/Assassin mix?  I was looking at str based duel wielders and came upon grizz' assassin king and was looking up assassin in the wiki and saw a note that a death attack is never reported as a sneak attack.  That must be how he was achieving 80+ dmg with no sneak attacking on a regular hit.  He must have kept hipsing and then nailing with death attacks.  Although If that was the case I would have thought I would have seen some death attack saves but either I missed it or it was something else.<br><br>No idea how else he could get that damage.

Right now I am kinda torn between 3 different options lol.  <br><br>Grizz's Assassin King seems like it would be awesomely fun as long as you don't get cocky and try to stay fighting too long.  It would probably be insanely good 1v1 as any time you see them start casting you could just hips and streak out then come back, negating your poor saves.<br><br>Some form of SD/AA also seems like it would be insanely good adding the bonus of being able to self haste/extended haste/true strike/II.  I was thinking maybe like 8 levels of wiz and then 1-9 SD (SD summons are buffed on server so torn between getting 9) and the rest AA.<br><br>Lastly some form of dual wielding strength based bane ranger possibly with fighter splashed for WS/EWS and possibly with BG for Divine added.  Also with all that str was thinking about maybe overwhelming crit and then using something like handaxe for an extra 2d6 but I don't know if that offsets the lower # of crits you would get.  Also this would be the least effective in staying out of wtfpwnbyspells/bettermelee(ness)due to no hipsing lol <br><br>Thoughts? Suggestions?  I will attempt to stop spamming my thread till someone replies.<br><br>Thoughts?
