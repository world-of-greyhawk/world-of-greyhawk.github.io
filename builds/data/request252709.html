Yeah, I know it's weird, but can anyone make suggestions on where to go with a character that uses unarmed strike but isn't a monk?  The idea would be to have someone who could duke it out in a ring as a pugilist, so all the damage really needs to come from his fists, not from spells.  Not that some spellcasting power would be unacceptable, but the character should be able to fight without it.<br><br>I think the most obvious routes are to concentrate on either KD + SA or get Weapon Spec + Bard/RDD for the strength bonus.<br><br>Any thoughts?

I have a Druid Assasin build that I rather like.  or Druid/Ro/SD<br><br>It is an Elder Earth Elemental that does IKD and 12d6 sneak attack damage. <br><br>Punches for 100+ at times.<br>Crit/sneak immune<br>mind spell immune<br>HIPS<br><br><br>But he's pretty slow.

Yes, that is actually quite excellent.  Are there any others?<br><br>And as to the earth elemental, it's okay if he's slow, the enemy should never see him coming, eh?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Ariel Thomas on 09/13/06 14:39</span></i></p>

Since you're a puncher, you might want to sneak in Blind Fighting in there instead of the Improved Sneak Attack 1.<br><br>Or anywhere your heart desires.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

Normaly a PC who punches will invoke an AOO if they don't have Improved Unarmed Strike.  I do not believe that a polymorphed character suffers that fate.  The reason is because they technically have a "Creature Weapon" that they fight with.  So no AOO when attacking in a shifted form.<br><br>I believe that was the concern in your first note.<br><br>Non Weapon Bypedal forms include:<br><br>- Druid Elemental forms Huge and Elder (excluding water Elemental, since they look like they attack with a staff)<br>- Shifter: Vampire, Gargoyle, Harpy, Medusa, Mind Flayer, Constructs, technically Dragons too<br>- Mage polymorph spell: Zombie, Troll, Umber Hulk<br>- Mage Shape Change:  Death Sladd, Iron Golem, Red Dragon<br><br><br>I don't think Dragons fit the theme of your boxing build.<br><br>Vampire might be interesting since they also drain levels ala Mike Tyson ear bite move.<br><br>Troll has 23 str and +5 regeneration<br>Umber Hulk has 23 str and True Sight<br>Constructs and Elementals have DR of at least +3, might be handy in a fist fight.
