Okay, congratulations on your first build in the Guild.  Let me first say that it is best if you included all appropriate stats, skills, saves, etc for those who come here to play a build.  It also shows that you did your homework.  Now for the build:<br><br>1.  Because you chose Elf, you incur Experience penalty from Lvl 21 onward.<br>2.  You get a decent skill set with you above classes, but you have a 10 Int.  Not good.  <br>3.  You have Improved Knockdown which is impossible for a 10 Int.<br>4.  Bane of Enemies seems like a must in this build.  Where do you take it?<br>5.  You've focused in a rapier.  Have you considered a 2-handed weapon to gain the 1.5x damage modifier with you tremendous strength?<br>6.  On the same note, why dualwield rapiers?  Why not shortswords which would give you an instant +2 to AB(-2/-2 vs -4/-4).  You only lose 1 threat range.<br>7.  You've taken Prowess before EWF...an oversight?<br>8.  Have you considered stopping at Ranger 26, and scattering a total of 4 Bard levels for Tumble and Spellcraft dumps?  He would highly benefit from the extra +4AC(he's only light or med armour with a 10Dex) and the +4 to Magic Saves.  I would even consider taking Armor Skin as my Lvl 21 Bonus feat.  <br>9.  #8 is made worse by the fact that he is going to have low to mediocre hit points for a melee build.  This calls to question the race selection once again.<br><br><br>Anyways, this is some constructive feedback, I hope.  One thing to bear in mind that AB isn't everything.  Make sure you note for what environments this is intended to be played, and if it's playable from 1-40.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

With Human you could take wpn proficiency exotic and use kukris instead of rapiers or short swords and get the best of both weapon aspects.

Not to mentioned getting rid of the XP penalty.<br><br>I can understand not wanting to be just another human, but with these stats and these classes, elf really isn't giving you anything but an XP penalty, one less feat, and one less skill point per level.  I see a lot of disadvantages to choosing elf over human and no particular advantage.<br><br>Steve
