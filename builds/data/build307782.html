The monk knelt in quiet meditation on the cold stone floor with his eyes closed.  He thought of the day's events and of the events to come.  A thick cushion lay next to him, but years of training on the hard floors of his monastary had hardended his skin and bone to the point where Togamoto Kitsumori barely felt the difference or even cared.<br><br>He heard the rustling of a servant approach his room.  The servant was attempting to be quiet in an effort not to disturb the monk, but Togamoto had sensed the servant long before any sound had reached his ears.<br><br>Without opening his eyes and before the servant was able say anything, Togamoto asked, "Is it time?"<br><br>The servant was clearly caught off guard but she quickly composed herself and replied, "I'm sorry master Kitsumori, I didn't mean to disturb your meditation but the judges wanted me to inform you that your opponent has declared his readiness and so they are awaiting your presence.  If you'd like, I can stay until you're ready so as to give you any time you need."<br><br>"Thank you but that won't be necessary.  Please inform the judges that I'm on my way."<br><br>As the servant left to deliver the message, Togamoto stood, stretched and gathered his thoughts.  It had been over two years since he left his monastary and the Order of Jade Lotus behind but it felt like yesterday.<br><br>Two years ago...<br><br>"You are restless Togamoto."<br><br>It wasn't an observation but a statement of fact.  Kuugen Stoneguard, Togamoto's sensei, had an annoying habit of looking through appearances and getting straight to the point.  Maybe it was because he was a Dwarf, Togamoto mused.<br><br>"Yes sensei.  I do not know what is wrong.  I know I should be proud of having just completed my training and accepted as a Fire Sohei.  I also have had the priveledge of studying under you, the most senior sensei in the Order, and becoming one of your senior students.  Yet, for all my accomplishments, it feels the path before me doesn't seem to be right.  I've enjoyed all I've learned but I don't understand why.  Until I understand why, I can't believe that I'm on the right path."<br><br>Kuugen listened to his student and patiently waited for him to finish.  The sensei was an old Dwarf and had seen many students come and go in his time.  When Togamoto finished, the sensei chuckled and said, "Togamoto, do you think you're the first to feel this way?  One of the problems of being a monk is that you have too much time for reflection.  When you're not practicing kata, performing your monastary duties, or flirting with the nuns, what do you do?<br><br>Your mind wanders, you start thinking about the teachings you hear everyday and you begin questioning everything.  I was a lot like you once: young, strong, confident, and confused."<br><br>"What did you do about it sensei?", asked Togamoto.  "I feel a little relieved to hear that you as well as other monks have gone through this as well, but it doesn't help me if I can't do anything about it."<br><br>"My suggestion to you is to leave the monastary for a while," replied the sensei.  "At the monastary, we are isolated and often forget there is an empire around us.  Emperor Wau Di sends envoys occasionally and the imperial heralds make their stops here but otherwise there is no reminder.  Walk the lands Togamoto, understand the people and places that surround us and how our teachings apply to everything.  Your wings and my bone arm are as normal as hands and feet here; see how the outside world views these.<br><br>You've grown strong through the training.  Your fighting skills are among the best I've seen and you've mastered the powers of your tattoos.  What you lack is strategy and perspective.  We've taught you everything that we could, now it's up to you.  Some monks need time understand their path.  Come back if and when you've gained your understanding, the monastary doors will always be open to you Togamoto."<br><br>The next day, Togamoto left the only place he had known as home.  He wandered the lands and experienced many adventures and mishaps.  Nothing was noteworthy until he arrived at the the town of Cabilan, a port town and the starting point of many of the empire's trading routes.<br><br>In Togamoto's third night in Cabilan, a commotion outside his room drew his curiosity.  He peered out the window and saw about ten men running down the alley by the tavern.  Without a second thought, Togamoto grabbed his cloak, opened the window and jumped down to the alley below.<br><br>It wasn't difficult to track the men as their footsteps could be easily heard.  After following the men through a few alleys and streets, Togamoto found himself outside a warehouse.  A door opened, and a gruff looking half-orc greeted him.<br><br>"Well, what are you waiting for boy?  Are you in or out?  It's five gold if you're in, unless you're fighting then it's ten gold.  Otherwise I suggest you turn around and head on back to mommy."<br><br>He didn't have much gold left on him but the word "fighting" certainly interested him.<br><br>"Greetings.  What is this place?  I'm new in town but I'm certainly up for a fight and more than capable of handling myself."<br><br>This drew a loud snort and laugh from the half-orc.  "Capable?  I've heard that before!  This here is tonight's meeting for the Brotherhood of the Fist.  It's a fancy name and all but it's just a group of folks who want to test their mettle by beating on eachother.  No weapons are allowed, just fists and brains.  We meet regularly but have to move our 'meetings' around to keep the authorities from finding us.  There is a Brotherhood of the Fist in each town in the Empire and there is an annual tournament, the Tournament of the Fist, to see which Brotherhood has the best fighter.  We fight to see who we'll send to the tournament.  Of course there are a lot of just regular folks who just want to fight for the sake of fighting and have no desire, or skill, to participate in the tournament.  So are you in or out boy?"<br><br>"I'm in.  And my name's not Boy; you can call me Togamoto."<br><br>The half-orc accepted the gold and said," OK, sign in with the judges when you get inside.  They're in the first room on the right.  And good luck boy!"<br><br>Togamoto gave a good showing at his first Brotherhood of the Fist meeting.  With his training, Togamoto easily won his initial rounds.  However, lack of experience, or strategy as his sensei said, was his downfall and he bowed out in the quarterfinals for the night.  However, this only served to push him and it wasn't long before he was one of the finest fighters in Cabilan.<br><br>Present day<br><br>It was the championship round at The Tournament of the Fist.  Togamoto had lost count the number of matches he had participated in and won the past two years.  However, more important than the matches were the interactions he experienced.  He was surprised how the lessons he learned at the monastary applied, even though many of his teachers had never left.<br><br>As Togamoto stepped into the arena, he was greet by a chorus of cheers.  The stands were packed full of spectators, some wearing masks and hoods.  Though these events were officially outlawed, like any popular movement, many in the audience were prominent figures in the Empire and thus had to protect their identity when attending these events.  No questions were asked and no answers were offered.<br><br>The head judge motioned for the two fighters to step into the ring and announced to the crowd, "Tonight's final round is between Togamoto Kitsumori of the Cabilan Brotherhood and Muhisalas D'Erthi of the Moonvale Brotherhood.  Unlike the other contests, there will be no draw.  The winner will simply be the fighter standing at the end.<br><br>The champion of this year's Tournament of the Fist will receive a sum of 10,000 gold as a pair of gloves that were recently discovered at the Dwarven ruins of Dorig Kahalaas.  We believe these gloves were worn by one of the finest fighters known in the Old World, Tugin Hammerhand, who established the Brotherhood of the Fist over 500 years ago.<br><br>Fighters, are you ready?"<br><br>The two contestants bowed to the judges, the crowd and finally to one another.  With ceremony out of the way, the championship match began.<br><br>Togamoto and Muhisalas carefully circle eachother, the look of two veteran warriors sizing up their opposition.  Muhisalas was of Elven descent, lean and graceful like most of this kin, but had a look of rage in his eyes that few could bare to look at, and had hideous scars along his chest and arms.<br><br>It was Muhisalas who spoke first, though it was barely a whisper.  "I've heard of you Togamoto.  Your wings and tattoos mark you as one of the Jade Lotus, and a Fire Sohei no less.  I've heard of your exploits and you've accomplished much.  It will be a great pleasure and honor when I bring your head to my masters."<br><br>With that, Muhisalas exploded into action.  He lashed out with a quick snap kick at Togamoto's groin and followed up with a roundhouse kick to the head.  The momentum of the roundhouse continued into a spinning backheel again aimed at the head.  Togamoto blocked the first kick and spun to remain out of reach of the roundhouse.  However, he wasn't quick enough to dodge the backheel and the power of the kick brought Togamoto down to one knee.<br><br>This brought a feral grin to Muhisalas.  "First blood to me.  You see, you're not the only one with abilities."<br><br>Only then did Togamoto recognize the series of inscriptions on Muhisalas.  What Togamoto had thought were scars were actually arcane inscriptions, with one in particular glowed a bloody red.<br><br>Another scar glowed, this a deep reddish brown, and Muhisalas launched another series of attacks, this time with a series of punches.  Togamoto instinctively activated his own tattoos, one of an owl and another with the outline of a shield, and leapted forward.  Muhisalas again landed the first blow, with a hissing sound as his fingers touched Togamoto's arm.  A course of energy flowed into Togamoto but had no affect.  The lack of any reaction seemed to break Muhisalas's concentration, and in response, Togamoto shoved an elbow into Muhisalas's face and sent two rapid palm strikes into the Elf's chest.  The force of the blows sent him into the air and he flew 10 feet back, landing awkwardly on his back.<br><br>"Were you trying to scratch me to submission?  You'll have to do better than that Elf."<br><br>"Impressive, Togamoto," coughed Muhisalas as he got back to his feet.  "I didn't think you had the strength to withstand my Finger of Death.  I may have underestimated you a little.  Just a little though.  Now I'm finishing this."<br><br>A series of inscriptions activated as Muhisalas began a complex set of movements.  Togamoto activated two tattoos of his own, a cross and an ox, and sprung forward with all his speed.  A blinding glow of energy enveloped Muhisalas and he pointed at the charging monk.  However, before he could finish, Togamoto was on him.  The first of the blows easily broke Muhisalas's arm in an attempted block, the second shattered one of ribs and a third was a knifehand that crashed down on Muhisalas's temple, knocking the Elf backwards.<br><br>Somehow, he managed to stay concious and on his feet, and sent a sizzling beam of energy at Togamoto.  However, the pain from the blows caused his aim to be off, and the blast missed the monk and nearly hit the judges.  Muhisalas cursed and charged Togamoto while continuing to glow.  Togamoto recognized the Elf's intentions, channeled his own inner energy and unleashed a ball of blue fire that hit Muhisalas squarely in the chest.  The impact vaporized the Elf's midsection and he fell to the ground in two pieces.<br><br>There was a hushed silence as the fight finished.  The display of both physical and metaphysical powers and the carnage had left the audience stunned.<br><br>The head judge cleared his throat and spoke.  "I declare Togamoto Kitsumori the winner of this year's Tournament of the Fist.  You fought with honor and courage and your name will be recorded in the annals of the Brotherhood.  It is unfortunate Muhisalas D'Erthi perished but given that he himself had killed three opponents, it was perhaps karma.  As a tournament winner, you are hereby prohibited from competing in any future Tournaments of the Fist, as all tournament winners are."<br><br>Togamoto tuned out the rest of the head judge's speach as he played back the fight in his head.  It was apparent that Muhisalas meant to kill him but why?  Who were these masters Muhisalas spoke of?  What were those inscriptions on the Elf's body?  He was ready to return to the monastary now but he also knew he wouldn't be able to stay.  There were more questions to answer.<br><br><br>***********************<br><br>The inspiration of this build comes from a variety of sources, but mostly the tattooed monks found in Legends of the 5 Rings and the Street Fighter (Ryu/Ken) games.  This character focuses only on unarmed combat and uses the Sorcerer's spells (tattoos) as buffs.  The only direct offensive spell I've allowed myself to pick is Fireball (as an extension of the monk's chi) but feel free to pick whatever suits your tastes.  I've picked Dev Crit for this build so it is somewhat feat starved but I think I have most of what I wanted anyway.<br><br>A quick search using the Search Engine revealed 10 builds using the same class combo, but only two had 20 levels of monk and more than 1 level of sorcerer:<br><br>Red Dragon Monk (Monk 25 / Sorcerer 5 / Red Dragon Disciple 10) by DaMouse404<br>Unnamed (Monk 21 / Sorcerer 9 / Red Dragon Disciple 10) by Xeroyne<br><br><br>The Fire Sohei - Monk 20, Sorcerer 6, Red Dragon Disciple 14<br>Human, Lawful (any)<br>PvM, Playable 1-40<br><br>Str	16  30<br>Dex	12<br>Con	16  22<br>Int	10<br>Wis	8<br>Cha	12  14<br><br>Hitpoints:  556 (Max)<br>Skillpoints:  193<br><br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Reflex/Will): 29/21/14<br>                  +Resistance cantrip: 30/22/15<br>                    +Prot from Align): 32/24/17 &lt; if vs. good/evil<br>                       +Owl's Wisdom): 34/24/18 &lt; if Wis goes to 12/13<br><br>Saving Throw bonuses:  +8 vs. spells (Spellcraft)<br><br>BAB:  24<br>AB:  +38/+35/+32/+29/+26 (unarmed)<br>AC:  29 (naked) / 33-36 buffed<br>     +4 (Shield spell)<br>     +1 (Owl's Wisdom if Wisdom goes to 12/13)<br>     +2 (Prot from Align if vs. good/evil)<br><br>SKILLS (193 points total)<br>Discipline 40<br>Tumble 40<br>Spellcraft 40<br>Concentration 30<br>Lore 8<br><br>35 points remaining - suggestions: put more into Concentration, Listen, Taunt<br><br>LEVELING GUIDE<br>01: Monk 1: Improved Initiative, Power Attack<br>02: Sorcerer 1: <br>03: Monk 2: Wpn Focus (Unarmed)<br>04: Monk 3:  (Str)<br>05: Monk 4: <br>06: Monk 5: Called Shot<br>07: Monk 6: <br>08: Monk 7:  (Str)<br>09: Monk 8: Great Cleave<br>10: Monk 9: <br>11: Monk 10: <br>12: Monk 11: Improved Critical (Unarmed) (Str)<br>13: Monk 12: <br>14: Red Dragon Disciple 1: <br>15: Red Dragon Disciple 2: Improved Power Attack<br>16: Red Dragon Disciple 3:  (Con)<br>17: Red Dragon Disciple 4: <br>18: Red Dragon Disciple 5: Blind Fight<br>19: Red Dragon Disciple 6: <br>20: Red Dragon Disciple 7:  (Con)<br><br>21: Red Dragon Disciple 8: Overwhelming Critical (Unarmed)<br>22: Red Dragon Disciple 9: <br>23: Red Dragon Disciple 10: <br>24: Sorcerer 2: Devestating Critical (Unarmed) (Con)<br>25: Sorcerer 3: <br>26: Monk 13: <br>27: Monk 14: Epic Damage Reduction I<br>28: Monk 15:  (Con)<br>29: Sorcerer 4: <br>30: Sorcerer 5: Epic Damage Reduction II<br>31: Red Dragon Disciple 11: <br>32: Red Dragon Disciple 12:  (Str)<br>33: Monk 16: Epic Damage Reduction III<br>34: Monk 17: <br>35: Monk 18: <br>36: Monk 19: Epic Weapon Focus (Unarmed) (Str)<br>37: Monk 20: <br>38: Red Dragon Disciple 13: <br>39: Red Dragon Disciple 14: Armor Skin, Epic Prowess<br>40: Sorcerer 6:  (Str)<br><br>Suggested spells (Tattoos):<br>Cantrips:	All (Resistance first)<br>Level 1:	Shield, Protection from Alignment, True Strike, Endure Elements<br>Level 2:	Bull's Strength, Owl's Wisdom<br>Level 3:	Fireball<br><br>Pros<br>Overwhelm Crit at lev 21 / Dev Crit at 24<br>No kamas :)  <br>All level 20 monk abilities<br><br>Cons<br>Wings<br>Poor will save<br>AB not that great<br><br><br>Let me know what you think.

Good build, at the end your low will is not very relevant as immunity to mind spells will cover that.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 04/02/09 18:35 (GMT) -- ptlee00<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Reflex/Will): 29/21/14<br>                  +Resistance cantrip: 30/22/15<br>                    +Prot from Align): 32/24/17 &lt; if vs. good/evil<br>                       +Owl's Wisdom): 34/24/18 &lt; if Wis goes to 12/13<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Owl's wisdom raising fort by 2 and will by 1; should be will by 2.  In general, at the end, I would have cat's grace instead of owl's wisdom.  Immunity to mind spells will negate most will conditions, and dex increases will be more effective at raising AC than wisdom (as the first 2 points in wisdom bring your score to 10 which doesn't raise your AC at all).

Thanks for the suggestion and correction WhiZard.  I was torn between Cat's Grace and Owl's Wisdom but your advice is sound.  You can always stock up on potions and get both of course...<br><br>Can someone check the attack bonuses?  I'm not sure if that's right or not.  When I went back into the game, I noticed that if you start a module with a Preselected Character, a different set of AB's appear but the numbers change when you actually get into the game.  I'm thinking this has something to do with the Monk's unarmed attack mechanics.  It seems they should be higher???<br><br>I realized I forgot to post the damage.<br>Damage:  1-20 + 10 (Critical: 19-20 / x2)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ptlee00 on 04/02/09 21:01</span></i></p>

AB is fine: 14 pre-epic BAB yields 5 monk progression attacks.  24 BAB + 10 (STR) + 3 (Foci) + 1 (Prowess) = 38. So your progression is correct.
