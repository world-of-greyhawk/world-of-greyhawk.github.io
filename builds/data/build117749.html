I have a different build that kind of avoids the problem, although I don't like it quite as much from an RP perspective:<br><br>Elven Bounty Hunter<br><br>Race: Elf. Align: True Neutral<br><br>Str 12, Dex 20, Con 12, Int 12, Wis 8, Cha 8<br><br>Rogue 1 - Pointblank Shot<br>Rogue 2<br>Rogue 3 - Weapon Focus Longbow<br>Rogue 4 - Dex to 21<br>Rogue 5<br>Rogue 6 - Rapid Shot<br>Rogue 7<br>Rogue 8 - Dex to 22<br>Bard 1 - Toughness<br>Arcane Archer 1<br>Arcane Archer 2<br>Arcane Archer 3 - Dex to 23, Imp. Critical Longbow<br>Arcane Archer 4<br>Arcane Archer 5<br>Arcane Archer 6 - Dodge<br>Arcane Archer 7 - Dex to 24<br>Arcane Archer 8<br>Arcane Archer 9 - Open Feat<br>Arcane Archer 10<br>Rogue 9 - Dex to 25<br>Arcane Archer 11 - Great Dex I (26)<br>Arcane Archer 12<br>Arcane Archer 13<br>Arcane Archer 14 - Dex to 27, Great Dex II, III (29)<br>Arcane Archer 15<br>Arcane Archer 16<br>Arcane Archer 17 - Great Dex IV (30)<br>Rogue 10 - Dex to 31, Improved Evasion<br>Arcane Archer 18 - Great Dex V (32)<br>Rogue 11 - Defensive Roll<br>Arcane Archer 19<br>Arcane Archer 20 - Dex to 33<br>Rogue 12 - Epic Dodge<br>Arcane Archer 21<br>Arcane Archer 22 - Great Dex VI (34)<br>Rogue 13 - Dex to 35, Self Concealment I, II<br>Arcane Archer 23<br>Arcane Archer 24<br>Arcane Archer 25 - Self Concealment III<br>Arcane Archer 26 - Dex to 36, Epic Focus Longbow<br><br>So we wind up with Arcane Archer 26/Rogue 13/Bard 1.<br><br>I hate single levels of classes taken to satisfy requirements, which is why I think this RP's less well, but what can you do?<br><br>This build doesn't have to waste 3 pts on Charisma (I hope) because it starts with Rogue and not Bard. So it gets all-around better stats for a sneaky archer.<br><br>Attack winds up at +54 instead of +56, due to 4 less overall Dex. However the Sneak Attacks are now 7d6 instead of 5d6 and do not have the chance to Paralyze. I think the offense is down a bit in this build, but not ciritically so.<br><br>Defensively the build is much stronger, trading off 2 AC from lower Dex bonus for Epic Dodge, Improved Evasion, Defensive Roll and Self Concealment III (30% chance to completely avoid any hit!)<br><br>Skills wise the build has +48 skill pts from taking 13 Rogue levels instead of 8 Assassin and 4 Bard. This makes the tradeoff for Darkness, Improved Invisibility and the Bard spells into basically a fully optimized skill of your choice. I think the Drow Hunter Assassin gets the better of the deal here but not dramatically so.<br><br>I'm going to throw this one together tonight and see how it feels.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 19:40</span></i></p>
