My expertise in building lies more in the uber dex and straight melee type builds.  I play on a PW with uber equipment and which I consider very high magic.  I want to play a Cleric with decent melee skills and casting skills.  I don't really think that I need a buffing Cleric due to the equipment available, but I do need a reasonably high DC for my spells.  I am thinking maybe incorporating Fighter and Wep Master in with him, but I am not sure what is the best way to go.  I have looked through all the Cleric builds in the forums and almost every last one of them was mainly for buffing up.  Anybody with a good build idea or that knows of one for this situation, please let me know.  I also believe that one of my domains will be Magic as I can get Ice Storms with that one.  I appreciate any help I can get with this.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

I am new in this forum and not an expert regarding builds, but if you take my two cents and if your PW allows it, you may get the PRC pack and have a look into the Hierophant prestige-class.<br><br>Alexandra

For clerics - especially caster-centric without PRC - I'd go cleric 38/monk1/ if-you-can-spare-it-Rog1.  This gives you your wisdom bonus to ac (wear robes though!); rogue umd (if taken at the right time, epic umd too I think).  Monk attack progression; evasion, some other bits like cleave too.<br><br>Still; this assumes you can get good kama's for the attack progression.

Thanks for the suggestions guys.  No PRC on the server I play at, so the Heirophant is a no go.  I will look into that monk/rogue idea though.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

Personally, I'm a fan of cleric/cot/rogue. Use the cot to get your bab to 27. so basically 10 cot pre-epic. and you get some much needed feats to boot....or go 4 cot and take 6 cot post epic for epic feats and loss of one bab to 26 but still netting you 4 attks per round. Rogue I'd take post-epic as well and only 3 lvls of it to net you uncanny dodge. So the build would be something like "10 cot/ 27 cleric/ 3 rogue." Mind, everyone, this would be a PvM character as the DC wouldnt be worth a dang for PvP. For Domains I like magic, to get ice-storm and trickery, for imp invs.<br><br><br>Jim,(Fist.)

Thanks for the input Fist.  I was definately thinking Rogue in there for a few levels.  Now I will have to take a look and see what it would look like with CoT in the mix as well.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

Save a rogue level for later to maximize your tumble for 8AC <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>-DaMouse
