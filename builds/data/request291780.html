I am getting ready to enter a fighting contest on my server.<br><br>The only banned class is PM.<br><br>I am looking for orc build, with high AB, decent AC, and Dev Crit. Saves are not that important, well fort is. There is no magic involved as spell casters are having there own contest. Any help would be appreciated. I have checked the chac build search engine, but there are so many, not sure which would be the best. I was looking at MIth's Master fo Melee build ,but that is human, not sure if I could switch to Half-orc or not.

Well:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "215866", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>  	 Trollborn Asgardian (Fighter6/CoT6/WM28) </a> might be what you're looking for. At least it has great AB, but a lousy FORT save. Must drop 1 weapon and maybe a couple og GrSTR feats to get Dev crit, maybe.<br><br>At least it's the only character I have made that suits your requests.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Thanks Grim, any build you have is well above the Norm.
