Im playing on a PW that needs permission for the PRC classes so cant even say i can play it. But still the mix just screams cleric 25/warpriest 10/hierphant 5?

Why warpriest over hospitaler?<br><br>iirc, warpriest has spell per 2 lvls, while hospi has spell per lvl.  It means you will have a higher caster level.<br><br>Hospi also gets bonus feats at 3, 5, 7, 9, sort of like a COT (not exact but you are still gaining as a cleric!).  <br><br>Honestly, i never ever understood the warpriest, so i am not the best to recommend.  Unfortunately, that means that you also MAY not get much help, as it seems that i am one of the few to post in this area.  <br><br>The thing i can say though, is you are making a cleric, so follow a cleric/cot build, essentially.   It does come down to HOW you play.  If you are like me, i ALWAYS leave my clerics at 15bab by lv 20.  THat means, limiting pre 20 to 2 or 3 warpriest at most.  THis is to use DP to its fullest.  <br><br>other than that, just have fun and experiment.  I know this isnt what you wanted a(you wanted to be hand held). Unfortunately, i dont believe in hand holding. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    Also, seeing that this ISNT a build request forum, but a BUILD forum, go out and make one!  I do suggest my cleric/heiro/hospi for ALL the reasons listed, but that is me.<br><br>good luck<br><br>av<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; -- Posted by Kail Pendragon  <br><br>Being hyperbolic is an integral part of Avado's being <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Hi Toby! I play on the aforementioned server too. Sorry, nothing useful to add.

I looked at the warpriest for its area affect party boosting abilitys. A loss of 5 casting lvls didnt seem to be a great loss, and to be honest i never even looked twice at the hospitaler, thinking it was a cot in different clothes.<br> <br>As for the misplacement of the request, i figured that the PRC build fourm would have the players who would know the PRC classes. On that "hand-holding" no thank you, nope, im good, stay back...i got pepper spray!

if you are playin PRC rules, that means you get epic spells!  For cleric, that is SICK!  esp for warding.  5 caster levels means 250hp absorbed!  That is like a whole almost caster person!  lol  not quite, but nothin to sneeze at.  <br><br>That also means you have ema at +20 armor!  5 lvls is 5 more hours that it is up.   In vanilla nwn there is nothing you can do about it but suck it up.  In prc, there are CRAZY things you can do.  If you DONT get Living Undead (2nd lvl pocket imm to crit spell) then MAYBE Ooozemaster for a 3rd.  Why?  Full cleric casting, and you ONLY need 6 lvls for Imm to crits.<br><br>In prc, you can have CRAZY high DC dev critters (and if dev crit is banned with prc, well that just dont make sense) - as a side, you can get up to 50 BASE str with some builds AND vanilla races (some others make me SICK!), so imm to crits is pretty well essential.  The livin undeath spell is imm to crits and has that nice red glow, so it is easy to see if it gets dispelld.  <br><br>Hospi!  Yeah, when i first started to play PRC, i actually called it the Nurse!  I had NO idea how powerful it actually is.  Take a look at my posts in this forum, as most use hospi and they are so different it makes you sick.  imho, hospi is such a good class that it should be taken out of any server, but that is me!  Im alittle different than most!  <br><br>in the end, it comes down to how you play.  What server and what PRC do you guys play?<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/08/06 16:20:00 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I think avado answered your question like no other could... </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Arleah - Cardathian Adventures<br><br>we use an old old old old old  -old- version of Prc and modded it and intergrated our own classes.<br>_________________<br>If there is no struggle there is no progress.
