Originally, I wanted this character to be a melee Druid (NOT a dragon or shifter as Druids are usually abused for) using a scimitar who was also able to get excellent casting but because of the ability-score split required for this, I decided I may as well ditch the offensive casting bit and focus on buffing/melee. I'll still be working on a more caster-orientated version. I received a lot of help from Cinnabar Din on this and I'm very grateful for him putting up with all my ranting and spam and offering invaluable advice on how to go about this <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>I only found one build up which had this goal in mind, The Nice Forest Guy by Aligory - Druid 33/ Fighter 5/ Monk 2 <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "179427", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Druids are nowhere near the super nuko-powerhouses that Clerics are. They are fairly balanced until epic levels but Clerics go ZOOOOM away into stratospheric power compared to Druids after that (their spells are generally quite a lot better - especially Divine Power) while Druids stay pretty much the same <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">      .

Druids rock by the way... I have a Ecomancer Druid/ Cleric that I've built in PW that's a buffing machine. I seldomly use the Wildshaping ability as well... except to talk with an animal or the like... I really should post that build but I assume that it's already been done although I haven't checked.<br><br>The Monk suggestion also gives you Cleave... it might be something to think about. But the talk about level 9 druid spells being terrible, one word Elemental Swarm... the ultimate in IGMS tanking. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> , so we should see if we can get it earlier... if you went the Monk route you should take Monk 2 on level 37 (but you knew that).<br><br>Nice build though... nice to see other Druid fans out there.

Yes, I really wanted monk for the build but the CoT was taken for the Great Wisdom feats under Cinn's suggestions (even though it may not be so RP-friendly) and I had to mess with the levels a bit so I'd have the AB without sacrificing too many casterlevels. I don't think you'll want to be fighting in shapeshifted forms though without the monk levels, though you don't get dragonshape (but can fudge a bit with that 9th level polymorph spell) so meh :/.<br><br>I actually took 2 Grt WIS from CoT levels and 3 from Druid with this level setup but with a Druid 28/ Fighter 4/ CoT 8 split, more will have to be taken from CoT levels.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Jennalee on 09/22/05 00:24</span></i></p>

I think the max AB for this build would be 40. If AC is more important to you than AB, drop STR to 14 at the start and use the two freed-up points on DEX. Drop one GRT STR feat in Epic and pick up Armor Skin. 38 AB with a scimitar but +3 more AC.<br><br>Also, I posted a spell-breakdown here <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "16203", "149824", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>the Druid class</a> if you're interested in the Druid spells. I also didn't fail to notice that the Cleric one promised hasn't been posted (lol). You can do the maths with those spells (a Druid should be able to hit or almost hit the +12 STR bonus cap with their spells alone and hit the +12 WIS cap easily once they reach casterlevel 24 with Owl's Insight).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Jennalee on 09/22/05 13:14</span></i></p>
