the anti epic thread sparked an idea...<br><br>there are many reasons to go epic with casters, DC being a big one.  but would it not be wise to make say a lv 20/20 sorc/wiz or a lv 20/20 cleric/druid?<br><br>in the case of the sorc/wiz you would have an absurd amount of arcane magic to cast per day!!  granted it would be a bit weaker, but almost double the spells per day would be very nice!<br><br>besides the drawback of a lower DC and haveing to bump int and cha, what are the disadvantages of doing a build like this?  id prob get cha to 19 then go all int.  this would allow more skill points and even out the wiz and sorc in regards to spells per day.<br><br>hmmm just looking at lv 9 spells...<br>sorc 6 per day @20<br>wiz 4 per day @20<br><br>this is 10 lv nine spells a day not counting the wiz's high int and any items adding to it.  it would be very possible to get say 12-13 9th spells a day!!  wooot.<br><br>now considering the meta magic feats im thinking this PC would have way too many fireballs hehe, ie, maxed, empowered, normal, silenced, yada yada yada...
