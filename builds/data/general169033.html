Hey,<br><br>I am working on a build of a ranger/wm type and noticed that the crit bonus does NOT apply to the offhand!  This is ok, so i have changed my focus to more of a str based ranger.<br><br>My question is: how do we know the dex max that we can use with an armor type?  ie.  for full plate, what is max dex that you can have before you see that little red 1!<br><br>Thanks for any help<br><br>Peace

Your max dex bonus is dictated directly by the type of armor you are wearing. One easy way to find out is examine the armor. Full Plate for Example normally has a max dex bonus of 1, meaning if you wear fullplate, any dex bonus after +1 will be negated. (that is where you see a little red one) If the max dex bonus is +3 and your dex bonus is normally +5, you will see a little red 3. The lighter the armor the more dex bonus allowed generally. I checked the grimoire briefly but I didnt see anything that touched on this. <br><br>Hope it helps,<br><br>~E~<br>_________________<br>It's not a bad partnership.

Just as a quick addition to this. Dex bonus is only negated for certain skills (like sneak. hide , tumble) and is not negate for the purposes of things like - ranged attacks, melee attacks (with weapon finesse).<br><br>Syrath
