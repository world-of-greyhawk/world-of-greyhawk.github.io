At first glance, I'd drop starting Dex to 18, putting the extra 3 points to Str/ Cha.  Str 6 has a prohibitively low carrying capacity, I find, even if bags of holding abound.<br><br>There is a bug in the game that Improved Sneak Attack will not stack with Death Attack, even though you are allowed to take it, unless you have Sneak Attack from some other source (Blackguard levels, Rogue levels, or an item), so you can exchange all of your ISA's for something else.<br><br>Also,<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;03: Bard(3): Weapon Focus: Dagger<br>*snip*<br>06: Assassin(1): Weapon Finesse</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Weapon Focus nets you 1 AB, but Weapon Finesse nets you 6 AB.

Yes, this combination has not been officially done, though it has been "done", if you catch my drift.  Might I make a suggestion?  What if you said "damn my Stealth scores" and went strength based, and did something like Bard5/PM10/Assn25, or even the split that you have offered here.  You're still strong defensively, its the offense that needs a jolt.  You can still take ESFs in stealth, and Halflings, of all the races, get +4 size bonus on Hide checks, and an auto +2 on Move Silently.  UMD and Assn spells will further augment your stealth potentials so that you wont be limited.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I have made a version 2 of the Darth Stabber, thx to feedback. I find him much better to play now, having more strings to play on. He is strength based as grizz suggested and have sacrificed sneak attacks for damage and bard levels (more buffing). Stealth is still very good as he have ESF: Hide, so he can use the stab and fade tactics. He now focus scimitar, and he can cast Keen Edge to get nice 12-20 threat range for increased damage output. He only got 30 Tumble and dropped Set Trap to have maximum taunt. The trade of 2AC for a AB boost and mage distrupting is no problem since AC and defense is very good anyway. The saves are suspect I think.<br><br>Darth Stabber v2 (Bard9/Pale Master 16/Assasin 15)<br><br>- 8d6 Death Attack<br>- Very high defence (AC, PM, EMA, EW, Stealth, Improved Invisibility)<br>- 25 UMD<br>- Stealthy (assasin and epic hide)<br>- 3rd level Bard spells and level 4 slots for extended spells<br>- Improved Knockdown<br>- OK AB and Damage (actually quite good when buffed)<br>- Reliable taunt<br><br>Race: Halfling<br>Alignment: Chaotic Evil<br>PvM, might do well in PvP (low magic, I'll test it)<br>Ability stats:<br>STR: 14 (28)<br>DEX: 12<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 14<br>Leveling:<br><br>01: Bard(1): Weapon Proficiency Martial<br>02: Bard(2)<br>03: Bard(3): Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>04: Pale Master(1): STR+1, (STR=15)<br>05: Pale Master(2)<br>06: Assassin(1): Knockdown<br>07: Assassin(2): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>08: Assassin(3): STR+1, (STR=16)<br>09: Assassin(4): Extend Spell<br>10: Assassin(5)<br>11: Assassin(6)<br>12: Assassin(7): STR+1, Improved Critical: Scimitar, (STR=17)<br>13: Assassin(8)<br>14: Assassin(9)<br>15: Assassin(10): Improved Knockdown<br>16: Bard(4): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>17: Bard(5)<br>18: Bard(6): Toughness<br>19: Bard(7)<br>20: Bard(8): STR+1, (STR=19)<br>21: Pale Master(3): Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar, {Darkvision}<br>22: Pale Master(4)<br>23: Pale Master(5)<br>24: Pale Master(6): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=20)<br>25: Assassin(11)<br>26: Assassin(12)<br>27: Assassin(13): Great Strength I, (STR=21)<br>28: Assassin(14): STR+1, Epic Skill Focus: Hide, (STR=22)<br>29: Pale Master(7)<br>30: Pale Master(8): Great Strength II, (STR=23)<br>31: Pale Master(9)<br>32: Pale Master(10): STR+1, (STR=24)<br>33: Pale Master(11): Great Strength III, (STR=25)<br>34: Pale Master(12)<br>35: Pale Master(13): Epic Energy Resistance: Acid I<br>36: Pale Master(14): STR+1, Great Strength IV, (STR=27)<br>37: Pale Master(15)<br>38: Assassin(15)<br>39: Pale Master(16): Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor, Epic Spell: Epic Warding<br>40: Bard(9): STR+1, (STR=28)<br><br>Basic stats (Scimitar, Chainmail and shield):<br><br>Skillpoints: 226, distributed (modified)<br>Hide 43 (54)<br>Move Silently 40 (43)<br>Perform 13 (15)<br>Spellcraft 34 (36)<br>Taunt 43 (45)<br>Tumble 30 (31)<br>UMD 24 (25)<br><br>Hitpoints: 383<br>Saving throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/22/25 (+7 vs spells, +2 vs Traps, +5 vs Poison, +2 vs Fear)<br>BAB: 24<br>AB/DAM: 38/33/28, 1d6+9 (15-20 x2)<br>AC 35<br><br>Buffed with Bull's Strength, Greater Magic Weapon, Bard Song, Haste and Keen Edge:<br>AB/DAM: 45/45/40/35, 1d6+13 (12-20 x2) +3<br>Another 1-6AB and 30% spell failure on successful taunt<br>AC: 35+20(EMA)+3(MA)+4(Haste) = 62<br>Death Attack 8d6<br><br>Bard spell selection (Known, spells pr. day)<br>Level 0: 5, 4, any<br>Level 1: 4, 5, Balagarn's iron horn, Mage Armor, Magic Weapon, Protection from Alignment<br>Level 2: 4, 5, Bull's Strength, Ghostly Visage, Silence, See Invisibility<br>Level 3: 3, 4, Greater Magic Weapon, Haste, Keen Edge<br>Level 4: 0, 3, Extended level 3 spells<br><br>9 Bard songs (10 rounds): +2 AB, +2 DAM, +1 all saves, +8HP, +1 skills

DC 27 Death Attack is of questionable utility.  Rogue gets you 60 more skill points (or 72 if you take rogue at level 1), still no XP penalty, and an extra feat (from a better set of choices).  Everything on the Assassin spell list is also available from the Bard list, so the only thing you really lose is Use Poison.  You also have a pretty good selection of weapons without having to take the martial proficiency feat.<br><br>What type of armor do you intend to wear?  Medium is the best you have proficiency for, which is all I would recommend if you plan on stealthing, but your Dex is a touch low, so you'll probably have to invest in Dex gear on the way up.  Switching starting abilities to Str 12, Dex 16 gets you 2 AC/ reflex/ stealth, and you only lose 1 AB/ Damage (which will be made up by the strength gear you are wearing in place of the dex gear you'd be forced to wear).  It may seem counter-intuitive to start your core ability lower than something else, but I find it quite efficient to do so in Strength Halflings and Gnomes.<br><br>With only 3 attacks and a fair amount of sneak damage, dual wielding becomes rather attractive, and the high dex option makes it a possibility with the exchange of certain feats (probably improved critical, toughness, and martial proficiency, but those are just my preferences).<br><br>Edit: You may want to check your math.  I think your AC is incorrect, as well as your buffed AB, and you won't be able to wield a shield and a scimitar with a halfling.<br>_________________<br>(I enjoy writing parenthetically (a lot)).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By koolthursday on 09/30/06 21:06</span></i></p>

I think the calcs is ok.<br>AC: 10(base) + 10(PM) + 6(Tumble) + 1(Small) + 1(DEX) + 5(Chain) + 2(Shield) = 35<br>AB: 24(BAB) + 9(STR) + 1(WF) + 2(EWF) + 1(EP) + 1(Small) = 38 + 2(Bull's) + 3(GMW) + 2(Bard Song) = 45<br><br>Can't see where the rules say medium weapon and shield is not ok for halflings, but you probably know..? In that case AC is 33 without any shield.<br><br>Rogue instead of assasin is better in combo with Bard&amp;PM, I agree. But this is an assasin <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      He gets darkness and improved invisibility from assasin. He only knows level 3 bard spells and darkness is not in this builds spell selection.<br><br>I don't think dual-wield is smart in this build due to lack of feats. The purpose of the STR version was to deal damage other than sneak and the increased critical threat range from scimitar and improved critical is therefor essential. IKD is also essential for a stabber, so there are no feats to spare.<br><br>He is meant to use chainmail yes. If he is lucky to find dex+4-6 items he can put studded leather on.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By blixen71 on 09/30/06 23:14</span></i></p>
