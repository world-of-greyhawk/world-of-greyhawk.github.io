To do it, you MUST take either wm or aa (no other options for best ab).  Take 29 wm leaves 11 other lvls = cookie cutter.  <br><br>A non-cookie cutter would be a bard/rdd/pm set for longsword!

There aren't many ways to have a permanent high AB: AA for ranged, WM for melee.<br>The others relies on buffs or special conditions like Smite Evil <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">

Nice build but the AB would've dropped for me by 6 or 7 points. All I really want to do is tweak the build I have to pull out those extra few points of AB and whatever else I can, or so I have been told. Here's my build (which you've probably seen before).

Best you can do is +53 AB with a mundane weapon, I think. So your +50 AB isn't that far off.<br><br>If you go with FTR 11 (or 10)/Bard 1 (or 2)/WM 28, starting with 17 STR and take all 7 Grt STR feats, you'll end with 34 STR, +4 AB from WF, EWF, and Epic Prowess (the latter two are WM epic bonus feats), for a total of +30 (BAB) + 4 (WF, EWF, EP) + 12 (STR) + 7 (WM levels) = +53 AB. You miss out on Epic Weapon Specialization this way though. If you really want EWS, then start with 16 STR, take 6 Grt STR feats, and you can grab EWS by taking FTR on a feat level in epic. You lose 1 AB for a final AB of +52.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Not entirely true. Bard destroys the possibility of getting EWS while 2 more fighter levels easily make it possible.
