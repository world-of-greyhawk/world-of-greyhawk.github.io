I had this crazy idea that perhaps someone can build a Half-Orc Ranger/Cleric/Weapon Master. I'm looking for something evil, something with enemies human, elf, and dwarf. Something for some good PvP on PWs. I'm figuring with favored ememy, bane of enemys, and WM criticals you will be in good shape. Perhaps using the Greataxe will look really cool in this build, and thus allowing even more damage. But... perhaps even utilizing the improved two weapon fighting would be fun as well. Im thinking just use the two weapon style for PvM and dont even bother taking any feats for it.

You get 2 bonus feat pre-epic from FTR so you can get yourself feats like toughness, KD, IKD plus the WM required ones. Ranger 10/ FTR 2/WM 8 pre-epic is a good split to max saves. You get 7+3 feats in epic, meaning you can get yourself EWF, WS, EWS, EP, AS, BoE and 4 Gr.STR for a final 34 STR (assuming you start at 20, of course) and final AB 48 (30 BAB +1 WF +2 EWF +1 EP +1 SWF +1 ESWF +12 STR).

Ranger 35/FTR 5, STR-based. Forget WM. You'll have +8+2d6 vs FEs (and you can take a lot of them) +6 (WS/EWS) + STR modifier (probably 30 base STR, possibly 32) for a base of:<br><br>24 (or 25) + 2d6 + weapon base + enhancements<br><br>damage per hit.<br><br>If you really want to cheese out, take Club as your weapon and go with RGR 35/FTR 2/Rogue 3. You can still get WS/EWS in Club (it's a quirk with Club that you can take WS with only 1 FTR level, as long as your BAB is +4 or higher). This gives you better AC (Tumble as a class skill), Evasion, and 2d6 sneak damage.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

Otherwise, if you wanna dish out a lot of damage try something like this<br>Rang 23/ FTR 4/ Rogue 13, H.Orc<br>STR 18 (10) --&gt;32<br>CON 16 (10)<br>DEX 12 (4)<br>INT 12 (6)<br>WIS 8 <br>CHA 6<br><br>WS,EWS,EWF,EP,AS,BoE,4 GS in epic means you have to take all the FTR lvls after 20th lvl. You can take rogue only in epic to max AB, or get some lvls preepic to boost ref saves. All stats bumps into STR plus 4 Gr.STR for a final STR of 32. You get 2 rogue bonus feats (improved evasion and crippling strike as a suggestion), good amount of skillpoints, maxed tumble (+8AC) and UMD, +7d6 sneaks, more freedom with feats pre-epic (maybe something like WF-KD-IKD-called shot-disarm-improved disarm-toughness or whatever fits you).<br>Final AB should be 45 (47 vs FE) and damage output is simply awesome with all those sneaks...and crippling strike *drools* <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br>Summing up:<br>AB: 45 (47 vs FE) assuming BAB 30<br>DAM: +24 +7d6 (+29 +9d6 vs FE) with a 2hander<br>AC (naked/plate/plate+tower shield): 21/28/31<br>HP: 508<br><br>Hope you like it, I know you asked for a Rang/WM/Cl but I don't see it as very viable<br><br>Cheers<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

[MyTwoCents]I would like to add that Cleric 15/ Fighter 6/ WM 19 is EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE!!! I think its AB caps around 71 without dual wielding and it can easily fit Amb TWF and ITWF witout stretching. Im pretty sure it was a dexxer w/ Trickery and War domains.[/MyTwoCents]
