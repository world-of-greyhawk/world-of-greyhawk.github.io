I need some help with this build from the gurus. Idea is ranger specializing in bow but able to enter melee if needed. A lot of favored enemies with BoE to really help out.

Well, for the ranged power, the Arcane Archer's Enchanted Arrow improves +1 AB and damag every 2 levels of Arcane Archer, so pumping AA levels definitely gives you more AB and damage (or at least end AA levels in an even number), you'll lose your favored enemies, but you'll also gain more epic feats, since AA counts as epic for the bonus since level 11, 1 every 4 AA levels.....<br><br>But if you want to go melee..... why would you? DEX based, and with AA levels, you arrows will deal more dmaage than your melee. Still, you place Improved Two Weapon Fighting, but no melee weapon on it, which would suggest a longsword/short sword or somehing like that, but both AB and damage are below that of your ranged, no matter the two extra attacks.<br><br>Let's say you do <b>need</b> to fight in melee, for whatever reason, in any case, leveling in AA won't take off AB or damage, you would need to concentrate on STR, so, what I would change is more STR, which won't be bad in ranged if you get a powerful compsite bow with high mighty, I would say to lower INT and WIS to 12 both and get STR to 14 and CON to 12, as without HP, melee won't work either, the increase STR to 18 in the leveling (as I like to get it to 30 capped to use at full mighty a composite longbow +10), then keep on DEX, the STR and CON will help you on melee, and Ranger spells......... let's say I forgot about them, or lower Ranger level so that you don't gain level 3 spells, or change even more INT for WIS.<br><br>I would change Iron Will for Called Shot, it's very useful when fighting ranged.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/26/06 18:20</span></i></p>

I'd opt for Bard over Wiz in this build.<br><br>Purely for the gain from Bard Song and Tumble (Class skill)<br><br>Perhaps drop starting DEX to 17, giving you 2 into STR and 1 into CON. Slipping Great Constitution in somewhere may benefit further with the extra HP and 1 point to Fort Save.<br><br>I think you may be forced to wear Padded Armor or better, due to the lack of Uncanny Dodge. You'll be flayed alive and often without it.

You might really consider going strengh-based in this case.  Try starting with these stats:<br><br>Str 16 (20)<br>Dex 16 (22) (empowered Cats grace (28)<br>Wis 14<br>(shuffle the rest for your tastes)<br><br>... and maybe pump strength to 20 and put the rest into Dex.<br><br>If you take Empower Spell, you can cast an Empowered Cat's Grace (Ranger spell) which is usually good for a 5-7 Dex boost.  Plus, you have an extra +7 AB from a bow (AA ranged bonus). <br><br>Granted, you won't have quite the uber AB that an AA usually has, but it should be more than adequate, and you will be able to swing a sword much more effectively. <br><br>Here would be the ranged AB if you went that route.<br>AB 50 - (BAB 30 + buffed Dex 9 + WF 1 + EWF 2 + EP 1 + AA bonus 7)<br>Plus you would get to use Mighty +5 bows to their full potential.<br><br>Anyway, that's just my personal taste, take it for what its worth.<br><br>Cheers.
