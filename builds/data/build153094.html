This is yet another build for Imp Invis/Epic Dodge, which thanks to syrath I now love, and prefer quite a bit to SC V not only because it saves tons of feats, but because it gives you other buffs including death immunity spells, which I don’t like to leave home without. As usual comments/suggestions are much appreciated.<br><br>Phase-Kill seems to walk the edge of another dimension, blinking in and out of sight at will. He has a massive arsenal of spells at his disposal, and laughs as most blades penetrate only his shadow. If spells fail him, he can unleash a fury of blows with twin rapiers, or focused strikes with a single blade.<br><br>Race: Elf<br>Starting Stats (Ending Stats)<br>STR   10<br>DEX   18 (26)<br>CON   11 (12)<br>WIS   11<br>INT   16 (19)<br>CHA   8<br><br>1 Ranger-Weapon Finesse, Favored Enemy: (your choice, I prefer human)<br>2 Ranger-<br>3 Ranger-Dodge<br>4 Ranger-+1 Int<br>5 Ranger-Favored Enemy: (your choice, I prefer elf)<br>6 Ranger-Mobility<br>7 Ranger-<br>8 Ranger- +1 Int (dex hereafter)<br>9 Shadowdancer-Improved Critical: (your choice, I prefer rapier. If you wanted, you could go for longbow since you can’t use a shield anyways, and drop weapon finesse for point blank shot and blindfight for rapid shot. The only problem is you can’t do flame weapon, keen blade or greater magic weapon on a bow.)<br>10 Shadowdancer-<br>11 Shadowdancer-<br>12 Shadowdancer-Weapon Focus: (your choice, I prefer rapier.)<br>13 Shadowdancer-<br>14 Shadowdancer-<br>15 Shadowdancer-Toughness<br>16 Shadowdancer-<br>17 Wizard-<br>18 Wizard-Blind Fight<br>19 Wizard-<br>20 Wizard-<br>21 Wizard-Epic Weapon Focus: (your choice, I prefer rapier.), Great Int.
