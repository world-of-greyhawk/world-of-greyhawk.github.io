<b>Playable all the way (1-40), but reaches his true prime very late. Very good PvP. Requires two alignment changes.</b><br>_______<br><br>The Gods have always favored me. I don't know why. But I use their favor for what I can. Dark Gods and Light Gods, I serve them both. Like i serve them none.<br><br>I have walked the Path of Light<br><br>The Gods of Good chose me as their champion. I defended the people from oppressors and enforced their laws. I brought down criminals and villains. People saw me as beacon of light in a harsh world. Everyone looked to me for guidance. They looked to me for help. I got sick of it. People were tied down, not even could they rightfully take what was taken from them, the laws of good protected those who knew how to use it. I couldn't do anything when they plundered people legally. Walking the path of light were not freedom and equality for all. And another thing, people were so dependant upon my help, they soon became incapable of dealing with even the smallest of problems. I left them. I betrayed them. For their own good.<br><br>I have walked the path of Darkness<br><br>When i turned my back on the forces of good, the Gods of evil started whispering in my ear, promising me power. I grasped it with both hands. I started to attack the heroes of light, taking away the peoples protectors. Just like I once were able to smite Evil, i now smote good. Once I could destroy undead, now I could command them to do my bidding. Just like I always fought honorably and never struck an opponents back, I now made that strike to the back count. I oppressed the helpless people, taking their riches and ruling by force. I took what I wanted. It was so easy. But soon they started to wake up. With no Champion to gather around and do everything for them, hopelessness turned to hope. Indetermination turned to determination. An uprising started. i was able to quell it at first, but their determination and ferocity increased, and soon I had to leave the land. I was pleased. The people were strong again.<br><br>I now walk both paths. Yet I walk none of them.<br><br>The Gods of both sides seems to grant me their power, it is perhaps better I serve them both, than to serve one. Today I have followed an aspiring paladin into the hideout of an evil creature, spreading terror, murdering and plundering. The Paladin will probably bring this horror to an end. It will be a moment of triumph for him. His last, as I shall smite him down like a pig. Balance must be maintained. The people must be strong. No villain shall ever oppress them, no hero shall ever lull them into a helpless sleep. I will see to that.<br><br>______<br><br>A build that uses the exploit of not losing powers when changing alignment.

You can switch out improved turning, as you get a few uses of it. 1 of the Great Smites can be switched to KD or IC to. Or both. Your Bulls Strength from Blackie stacks with the Pal spell, but since STR items are often more availible than CHA items, use 2nd lvl PAL spell on Aura of Glory or Eagles Splendor. The saves are great and will increase more with CHA buffs, it will not be necessary to use items for save boosters at all, use something else.<br><br>This is a good build for PvP, because you can Smite both sides, and that will give you a huge advantage. Don't pick on Neutrals. Vs mages you are screwed if they can hold you with bigbys, but if you can connect a Smite, they will probably be done with one blow, perhaps two if they have Epic Warding up. Divine Might punches through Epic Warding to.<br><br>This is dependant upon two alignment changes, one from LG to LE at lvl 10, and then up to LN at lvl  30. It is not necessarily possible in all settings. Items with bonus slots for Paladin might be worth picking up, It would be nice with more lvl 2 spells.<br><br>This build utilizes exploits of BG/PAL to the max, as smite feats work on both Smite Evil and -Good. And the saves with +12 to CHA will be F58/R48/W50. That should be enough so that only autofail on 1 will be failure.<br><br>Hope the community enjoys my latest contribution, the Enforcer of Balance.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 11/08/05 19:18</span></i></p>

*low whistle*<br>i like the RP factor alone.  on top of that, you get the might of smiting, wrath, might, shield...i mean, there is little this one can't damage.  Bigby's might be a problem, as are any saveless spells, but anything else will bounce off you like rain on plate.  i like this one, despite the weakness of a lower strength.  looks like fun to play.  nicely done, yet again.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"You cannot pass!"

Hehe this will probably generate some interesting discussion on the whole align-changing BG/paladin exploit.  <br><br>Exploits aside, this still turns out as an excellent divine-feat melee user.  Your ending AB is low for a warrior-AB melee but perfectly acceptable; in return for that tradeoff when you smite someone with great smite 7 it's gonna leave a mark, that's for sure.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

But: No way to increase taunt. It is maxed, since it is not CoT class skill. As for spellcraft, there is no need to boost saves. but you can still trade 1 AB and dmg for INT, CON or DEX. There is always use for skillpoints. You can get 1 AC and 40 hps, 2 AC 86 skillpoints or some like that.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; in return for that tradeoff when you smite someone with great smite 7 it's gonna leave a mark, that's for sure.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Actually, its great Smite 8! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Thanks for your comments, folks.

Sounds like a great build. Wish it was posible on the servers I play. Technically it is on one of them, but smiters without G.Sanc are very difficult to play.<br><br>On an RP note, I wonder what the overall alignment of this build would be? (as percieved by others) I'm guessing it would be Lawful Neutral
