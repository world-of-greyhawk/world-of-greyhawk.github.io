But what about creatures with DR? You barely get Ki Strike +1 with 10 lvl's of monk, and your weapons shouldn't affect your dragon attacks (atleast they don't in 1.59). And in non-dragon form you really can't deal damage effectively enough.<br>I know that you can use dragon breath's to get damage through, but that would take REALLY long in some cases (like in my own test doll's case...).<br><br>Second, your HP (non-shaped that is, shaped it is actually quite high) will be lethally low. You really don't need 16 DEX, not for AC and definitely not for Circle Kick and/or Dodge. Those points are better spent on CON and STR (thought when shaped, all three are changed to dragon's standards. This means you get NO benefit for high STR/DEX/CON while shaped. Both our builds have naked shaped AC of 67, even after I have 4 less DEX non-shaped). Also, as you do not need CHA, you might as well use Dwarf instead for +2 CON (OR, you can drop STR/DEX/CON and really bumb CHA to make your Divine Wrath &amp; Lay on Hands usable. OR bumb INT for maximum skill points). Also, you could drop 2 INT points (if not going for the skill points). My version of "Dragon Druid" (posted earlier, in the first topic) had only 10 INT and was still able to max Discipline, Tumble, Spellcraft &amp; Concentration (this is not mentioned in the post, thought...)<br><br>And about the stuff... Your stuff are of no particular use for the Dragon shape (I somehow got +5 AC from some of my equipment, but don't really know which one. Not using ones listed, thought.) The shield, for example is only a hindrance, as it nullifies the Monk AC while not shifted (atleast in 1.59), and ALL your stuff go away while shifted (don't know which effects stay, but atleast stat bumbs from items don't).<br><br>Spells, however are just great. AC &amp; Regeneration + stat buffs (spell stat buffs stay) put aside, Barkskinned &amp; Stoneskinned dragon looks SOOOOOO cool. Something not-so-little like dragon statue that got bored to just be standing still... lol<br>_________________<br>"Lavamancers use three aspects of magic to make a golem: Transmutation; to mold the golem, Necromancery; to bind a soul to control the golem, and Evocation; to blast the damn thing on fire."<br>- Jushak Firestone - Grim Lavamancer<br><br>Edited By Jushak Brimstone on 02/17/04 10:22:04<br><br>When you Shift the shield is gone and the wisdom AC stays. you dont need it while unshifted. As Shifted you Merge Helmet, Armor, Shield. but AC Bonuses do Not Stack.<br><br>Doing Dwarf is better, as Halfling and Elf, but you get XP Penalty.<br>You may be right that Con is low, but my plan is not to do all of the battle unshifted. The idea of boosting CHA is good, i just don't like Paladins Abilities and prefer Hard to Hit Druid who prepares the battle and than the Dragon finishes it off.<br><br><br>As far as i know if you cast something as Iron Skin(10/5) on yourself you would act as +5 Weapon against DR.<br><br>Besides the Dragon is not the only shifted option. You can use Tensers Transform and get valubale HP Bonus. and if you don't like the big statue just use Elementals. After all you are better than Shifter.<br><br>Edit: can you imagine using Improved Knokdown or Stunning Fists as shifted<br><br>Edited By AntonTD on 02/17/04 12:57:53<br>     <br>AntonTD<br><br>Joined: 13 Feb 2004 	Posted: Tuesday, 17 February 2004 01:21PM<br>If I make Int and Con10, than the Skills should be like this:<br>Tumble 40(at Level 37), Concentration 43, SpellCraft 25, Discipline 43, and 1 point left.<br><br>But I think that they will not hit me enought while I am unshifted.<br><br>Edited By AntonTD on 02/17/04 13:25:53<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 10/12/07 19:28</span></i></p>
