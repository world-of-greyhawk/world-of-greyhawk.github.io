Alright, so I decided to make a Sorcerer26/BG3/Monk1. Mostly because I refuse to play the lawful good exalted sorceress. Anyways, I need some advice on feats. I worked out a few things, but I am unsure whether it is better to have greater and epic spell penetrations or 2 extra Great Charisma. I came to the conclusion that spell penetration was a better choice than taking combat casting/improved combat casting because of Defensive Casting Mode. My feats look like this:<br><br>Extend,Empower,Maximize,Still,Spell Penetration, SF:Necromancy, GSF:Necromancy, Power Attack (for Divine Shield requirement), Toughness, Epic Mage Armor, Epic Warding, Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy, Divine Shield, Autostill 1-3, Great Charisma 1-2, Greater Spell Penetration and Epic Spell Penetration. <br><br>If I took out Greater Penetration and Epic Penetration I could get an extra spell and probably +1 spell DC, I think. Also I would get an extra +1 armor when divine shield is on. However, I would lose a great deal of spell penetration as a consequence. Right now he has 28 Charisma. Should I take the two penetration feats or drop them for two more Great Charisma for a total of 30 Charisma? And if I drop them should I go ahead and keep the pre-epic version of spell penetration, as I don't think there is anything else of worth to put in its place?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By OMGZERGRUSHWTF on 09/17/05 06:07</span></i></p>

Well, the server I play on is kind of a mixed PvP/PvM. Thing about it is that I get +1 armor (divine shield), +1 DC and an additional spell slot for taking the two Great Cha feats. I also noticed the exalted sorceress build didn't bother with epic penetration, so I don't know how useful it is. Would the additional spell penetrations be as useful as the charisma feats in PvP or just PvM vs monsters with high SR? Also, the server I play on has failure on 1, I think, but unless I am mistaken the chance of someone actually rolling a 1 is only like 5%. I know the server I play on has lots of powerful DM customized monsters, but I don't know if they went crazy with the SR or whatever.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By OMGZERGRUSHWTF on 09/17/05 21:11</span></i></p>

Alright, thanks Cinnabar. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  I think my pre-epic feats go about one level into the epics so I could replace the +2 first spell penetration feat with something else, I think.

If I took ESF:Discipline my AC would be like 74 and my discipline would be 55 (43+2str+10ESF). Still pretty useless, I mean, the only way I could save against knockdown if they rolled higher than 74 would be by like 1 point, and if they are hitting that hard the check against KD would probably be much higher. Then again if they hit me unbuffed or roll a natural 20 then I think discipline still comes into play. So should I keep points in discipline at all? I mean, it would still help against people who hit me via rolling natural 20s or hitting me unbuffed. <br><br>Anyways, if its not going to be very useful should I put that feat into something like armor skin or maybe even hellball? Not sure which would be better in that case.

Hard call on the Discipline. If a natural 20 will KD you as well, then it may be worth taking. On the other hand, if you're in melee and they knock you down, you should have already put your reciprocal damage shields up (Mestil's, Elemental Shield, Death Armor), so they're going to take a big hit by beating on you anyway.<br><br>As for Hellball, it sounds great on paper, but oddly, I've never found it to do as well as it seems it would.

Thanks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> . But when you speak of discipline are you speaking of ESF:Discipline the feat or the idea of putting points in discipline in general. And what do you think of taking armor skin instead of either ESF:Dis or Hellball? Is it better than either of them?

Sorry I didn't mean charisma, I meant constitution. 16 con 8 dex or 14 con 12 dex? Sorry about that. Thing is I think fully buffed I will probably be maxing out my dodge bonus. I mean, +10 (or higher with items) divine shield and then haste and epic mage armor after that is well above 20. So I think con probably unless there is something I am forgetting.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By OMGZERGRUSHWTF on 09/19/05 20:49</span></i></p>

Well, I always have a high CON on my spellchuckers (16 if at all possible).<br><br>However, if you're playing in an environment where AC is extremely important, the 2 extra you get from 12 DEX as opposed to 8 DEX is probably worth it.

I think I may have pushed him a little further, now with the right sort of items and the correct buffs, he can jump from 56 ac to 74 AC. Instead of taking the Epic Mage Armor and having an extra feat, I go for two more Great Charismas for a total of 6 feats of it. This brings my charisma to 32. I keep my constitution at 16 and dex at 8. I go for +5 con boots instead of the sun soul + 5 boots. I then cast the following buffs: max eagle splendor, max cats grace and max endurance. This brings my dex to 13 for full ac bonus, my charisma to a ridiculous 42 for +16 DS for 16 rounds and my constitution to an impressive 26. I then cast divine shield, bringing my armor up to 74. What do you think of this? The only weakness I see is that he has only AC 56 when he isn't buffed up.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By OMGZERGRUSHWTF on 09/20/05 04:41</span></i></p>
