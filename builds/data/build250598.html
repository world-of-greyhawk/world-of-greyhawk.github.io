I mention this as I have choosen a feat not commonly used "called strike" and forgone epic dodge in the epic levels for KD and crippling strike again becuase of where it is played.<br><br>The main purpose of this build is to hit monsters and deal a lot of damage through the accumulation of many hits (preferably sneaking for better damage). Hence the build is skewed towards achieving a reasonable ab.<br><br>Ranger was choosen for the duel wield bonuses and the bonus feats it offers in epic levels allowed her to achieve focci in two melee weapons. She was combined with monk to achieve 8 attacks per round.<br><br>She loves to hold back and then moves in after the other team members to flank her opponents. When the party is surrounded by enemies its her job too cripple them all and when a high level bard (30) is present her KD and called strike kick in and shes like the happiest Ranger/Rouge/Monk in the world.<br><br>Erm and in case you didnt guess KK = Kama and Kukri's of Fury <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/10/07 14:09</span></i></p>

Curious about your starting stats:<br><br>Abilities<br>STR: 6<br>DEX: 20 (36)<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 16<br>INT: 8<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Why WIS 16? You only need 14 for all Ranger spells. <br>Your damage output could be boosted by the extra 4 points from there, so that at least your STR is no longer negative.<br><br>The WF and EWF in kukri I don't really understand as you already have both in Kama, which you can flurry. Kukri's of course you can't. That would allow you to take KD pre-epic and leaving an extra feat in epic too.

Valid point about exchanging wis for extra damage. Initally I went for the ac boost when designing the build.<br><br>The reason for not duel weilding kamas is that there is a 4 ab loss when weilding the kama in the off hand. Kukri being a tiny weapon means the ab loss is only 2.<br><br>As an aside the Kukri also needs to be weilded offhand to maintain the extra attacks the monk gives.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By seti-one on 08/22/06 11:06</span></i></p>

how do you achieve 8 attacks per round if you are dual wielding a kama and a kukri?

lol cross posted I was updating post while you were asking next question.<br><br>Just to clarify this build carries a kama in the main hand and the kurkri on the off hand.<br><br>When a monk has a kama on main hand it retains all its attacks.

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>Thanks that makes sense. <br><br>Apart from the Tumble Dump at 20th - why are you taking Monk at that point?<br><br>Really though you could do well to take WF Dagger instead saving you a feat, particularly if you took Monk at 2nd level - giving you the chance for 5 into Tumble straight away, Cleave, Evasion and Flurry all are available too. This would allow you to drop Wpn Prof Exotic altogether.<br><br>You could then rejig your epic progression to take your first Rogue level at 22nd to dump into Tumble yet again.<br><br>Currently you have an XP Penalty from 20th level until 40th of 20%.<br><br>Opportunist - is this really worth and Epic Feat - with such a high Reflex save you would benefit immensely from Improved Evasion in its place.<br><br>Ideas really.

Your ideas are welcome I already plan on droppin the wisdom for strength when rebuilding.<br><br>As for taking monk at level 20 I was able to take this build straight to 40 and so got lazy <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Oppurtunist I took because at the time it offered an ab boost which is what I was focused on at the time. After playing the build I realised it was redundant as I didnt get that many AOO's and well just didn't know what to replace it with.<br><br>Cheers <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">
