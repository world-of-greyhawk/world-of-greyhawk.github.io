Advancing in lvls is of course very important. So if you would make a char that would lvl up very fast which class(es) would you choose?

That question is far to vague to answer; because it depends on a great many factors.<br><br>-Play style<br>-World specifics<br>-Magic availability<br><br>etc. etc. etc. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>What do you play well:  IE If you hate the caster classes or do not know them well; then you would not do as well with them regardless of how easy they could be.  If the world is very low magic then a straight fighter would be hard pressed to compete with a casting class.  <br><br><br>Please provide some specifics if you hope to get any useful answers ok?<br>_________________<br>-4SakN<br><i>"never kiss a girl whose brothers have knife scars." <br>"never gamble without knowing a back way out."</i><br>-Robert Jordan

Bard. Bard gets and ECL adjustment to XP gained right up to level 14. No other class gets an adjustment for that long (they stop getting it at level 8 at the latest).<br><br>Of course, the factors outlined in the previous post are pretty important to take into consideration...<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I don't know the specifics, but ECL makes that your character level is taken as if it were lower than it really is for calculating how much XP you get from enemies, pretty much said, a Bard gets extra XP compared to other classes up to class level 14, I think it's Rogue which has ECL up to level 8, and the rest are even lower, some classes (I think Fighter, for instance) do not get this bonus XP, having ECL work up to level 14 makes Bard the fastest class to level up, he simply gets more XP.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;So if you would make a char that would lvl up very fast which class(es) would you choose?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>You might've meant fast as easy and not necesarilly as "fast", but Bards are playable anyway so there's no poblem.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Thax pretty much summarized it, but I'll add a bit as well:<br><br>ECL stands for Effective Character Level. This is applied to all non-full BAB classes after level 1 and up to level 8 for most, level 14 for Bards. Basically, since the game is so combat heavy, the designers decided these classes needed a little help at lower levels, so what happens is when the game is dishing out XP for kills, it looks at your classes. If you're playing one of the 'weaker' classes (and those classes are in a certain level range), the game will treat your character as being lower level than he actually is when calculating the XP awards.<br><br>The adjustment is not linear though. At level 1, all classes get the same XP per kill. It starts to change at level 2, but some classes have a wider gap than others for a while. Somewhere around in the archived threads there's a chart, but suffice to say Bard is the way to go if you're strictly looking at levelling fast. <br><br>Actually, the way to go for the fastest would be Cleric 5/SOR 5/Bard <i>X</i>). This will get you a major adjustment in XP. I believe it was Blue Emu who posted this mix. Playing through the OC with this combo, he was level 14 or 15 at the end of chapter one (normally you're around level 9, IIRC).<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 08/02/07 21:39</span></i></p>

Basically, you're building a Bard. Take just enough WIS to cast level 3 CLC spells, and you should be good to go. Be warned that this type of character will not be uber by any means. You'll be easily dispelled, and you won't get your Bard goodies until late in pre-epic levels. In fact, if you're only going to level 20, you'll only get 10 Bard levels and you'll miss out on the best the Bard Song has to offer. It's basically more of a gimmick to level fast than anything else.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Getting back to the original spirit of the thread...<br><br>Advancing in levels is easiest if you select the proper character type for your play style.  Corney, I know, but it's the truth.  If you're more of a melle type at heart than a caster class isn't your thing.  To advance fast, you really need to know and play your class well.<br><br>A sneaker can advance just as fast or faster than someone with better ECL.  <br><br>Knowing how to play your roll well will be much better than using a given build.  Admittedly there are gimped builds out there, so you don't want to fall down that path.<br><br>So, what type of character do you feel most comfortable with?<br><br>Toe-to-Toe melle?<br>Caster?<br>Sneaker?<br>Support Character?<br>Sneaker/Trapper?<br>Archer/Artillery support?<br>Other?
