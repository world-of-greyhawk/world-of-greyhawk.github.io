Here's the concept.<br><br>Simple: Bard + Sorc = CHA and AA = Range<br><br>Harder: I'm looking at a minimum 21 levels in Sorc (to match the PW I'm playing in) with the potential of integrating Bardic abilities due to the corresponding CHA ability (makes sense to me) and to top it off with AA as this allows the physical comnat to be ranged .. which is where a good spell caster should be.<br><br>One final thing .. Evil is Gooood.  Personally, I'm looking to use this build as an Evil PC within a PW, once which will be fighting against the Drow.  Race is not an issue, although half-elven or human makes sense.  Elven also, but it's not *my* aim.<br><br>I've tried to build this a number of times.  I've failed. Can you help me?  I seriously think this is a very nice combo from a RolePlaying point of view and would love to see it form into reality.

if it were me i would not combine sorc and bard in one build.  i can see why you would want to, but IMO it will water the PC down too much and he will have too many of the same abilities...<br><br>ive found more versatilty in the bard/rogue/AA and if you must have greater than lv 6 arcane spells id go for a sorc/rogue/AA.<br><br>but considering you do go sorc/bard/AA 21 lvs of sorc leaves you with 19 lv to play with.  you will need at least 9 in AA IMO and that leaves 10 or less levels for bard depending on how high you take AA...<br><br>all of those bard lvs will be wasted IMO and would be used better as rogue or sorc or AA lvs.  a sorc/AA would be nice, but then again a pure sorc is nice too, <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">
