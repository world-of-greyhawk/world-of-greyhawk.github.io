Hey guys. I've been lurking for many years, and finally decided to post! Well I have come with a challenge!<br><br>Anyways. I need a character who can Sneak/DW/Cast Spells/Good Mellee Presence/Not Flimsy/Can perform tasks such as Lockpick, Pickpocket, Disable Trap, Set Trap, Search, Spot.. etc/And he has to mature around level 12.<br><br>This character is for a very very low magic environment.(+2 items... what are those?)<br><br>And I know it sounds lame, but I really like the Double Axe Double Sword and Double Mace weapons (they look so cool!). If you could build this with those weapons it would be great.<br><br>Human, Elf, or Half-Orc is preferred! (but I dont want a stupid character <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">   )<br><br>One last thing. If a charaacter is a divine caster (druid, ranger, paladin, cleric) then it must have a deity that corresponds with its alignment and class.<br><br>Thanks. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br><br>P.S. I basically want something that can do.. everything! But whenever I build a bard (&lt;--- can do everything) it always seems raelly flimsy at low levels.. (the most important levels).. Oh and I forgot to mention, this server has been around for many years and the highest level a person has ever achieved is 16. When you die you basically go back to level 1. <br><br>Thanks again.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DarkInfernoo on 06/20/08 16:12</span></i></p>

Dude, there's no such thing as a level 12 good sneaker/meleer/caster with tons of skills (I don't even know what DW stands for), you can make it with 40 levels and it's still pretty tough.<br><br>Now, seriously, let me give you some advice: the character that is capable at everything is master at nothing. If you want a character that does too much you will be weak and sucky, if you specialize into one main power and boost it to max then you can excel and be strong.<br><br>For example, if you want too many skills then you need to invest in INT, but that means you won't spend in STR so your melee prescence suffers, but if you go with STR then you won't get spells and high DCs. Meanwhile your caster levels suck at BAB and HP but your melee levels won't improve your spells at all.<br><br>The only way around caster + meleer in 12 levels is either heavy Cleric (good combination with 1 level of Rogue and/or 1 level of Monk) or Druid 11 / Monk 1, you might try a Rogue / Wizard and spam True Strike for AB, but I doubt it will be really effective, the duration is too short to be reliable.<br><br>Cleric or Druid are both good for low magical environments, and pretty strong in low levels too, I'd say  they become strong since level 5 or 6, but you won't make it for sneaks and skills. You must pick something out of the build, so decide what's most important: if you want sneaks, skills, melee or spells, you should choose no more than 2 if you don't want to end with a weak character. Being strong and staying alive seems crucial on your PW.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 06/20/08 17:39</span></i></p>

Yeah I know it will be weak. But I was hoping, ya know? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>DW: Dual Wield<br><br>Still... I would really like a character that can do Sneaky Spelly things, but not a straight caster.. You're right, survival is key, and maybe I was asking for too much.<br><br>Druid is my favorite class, but I don't know how to instill a good melee presence into one. Could anyone maybe help with that? Druid with mellee and good survivability?<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Thanks.<br><br><br>P.S.

Huh, dual-wield, so after severe class difficulties, stat restrictions and impossible prowess, you also want to be feat starved.<br><br>Oh well, building Druids is my specialty, here's how you make it:<br><br><br>Human<br><br>Lawful Neutral<br><br>Stats:<br>STR 8<br>DEX 10<br>CON 14<br>WIS 18<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8<br><br>1 Druid1 -Blind-Fight, Toughness<br>2 Druid2<br>3 Druid3 - Knockdown<br>4 Druid4 - WIS +1 (19)<br>5 Druid5<br>6 Monk1 - Empower Spell<br>7 Druid6<br>8 Druid7 - WIS +1 (20)<br>9 Druid8 - Improved Knockdown<br>10 Druid9<br>11 Druid10<br>12 Druid11 - WIS +1 (21) Spell Focus: Evocation<br>13 Druid12<br>14 Druid13<br>15 Druid14 - Improved Critical: unarmed<br>16 Druid15 - WIS +1 (22)<br>17 Druid16<br>18 Druid17 - Greater Spell Focus: Conjuration<br>19 Druid18<br>20 Druid19 - WIS +1 (23)<br><br>This is my basic level 20 Druid/Monk build, and it's pretty good. The idea is to get to level 5 as fast as possible, beneath that, you use your Animal Companion and any help you can get in order to avoid damage, but once you reach level 5 you get Druid's Wildshape, which is quite strong by that level. By adding Monk you get the bonus WIS AC, along with Evasion to protect against spells. Monk will also give you the Monk's attack schedule when shifted, so that's +1 APR from Flurry of Blows at level 6, +1 APR at levels 7, 11 and 15 and 19 to end with 5 APR + flurry of Blows, the Bear shape has 28 STR if I'm correct, buff with Empowered Bull's Strenghth so your damage and AB are covered.<br><br>Druid gets Dire Shapes at level 12 and Elementals at level 16, so that's some more STR score for you. You probably won't get to the Elementals but you might get to the Dire Shapes. Druid spells go normally, the high WIS gets you a high DC, I like to focus on Conjuration to use Storm of Vengeance but you might not get it either.<br><br>You can drop 2 DEX and 2 CON to get 2 more INT, if you want more skills, but leave WIS high, it will boost your AC.<br><br>Another important thing is that Monk opens the skill Tumble as class skill, which adds +1 AC for ever 5 ranks, it could be nice to take a second Monk level to dump skills on that when you reach level 12, effectively +2 AC, it won't weaken your spells considerably.<br><br>Buffs. The Druid has several good long-term buffs, you can cast Bull's Strength, Barkskin, Stoneskin and Owl's Insight, they last very long so you can cast them once after resting and they will last until you rest again, some other buffs like Freedom of Movement, Elemental Shields (I don't recall how many of those are them and the exact duration of every one of them, but Energy buffer has 1 Turn per level) and True Sight get regular durations, they're still worth it and will last several real time minutes. I know it sounds awful to buff every time you rest, but I like to be buffed all the time. The best equipment this build can get is a Monk's armor of Haste, but I think you won't get it on a +2 environment, too bad.<br><br>Regarding the Animal Companion dying, you'll have to bear with it, before you reach level 5 the build is somewhat weak, but if you start with more STR or DEX they will be wasted once you get the shifts. One "trick" I usually do is to order my Animal Companion to move (commands: follow) repeatedly so it disengages combat and you can start dialogue mode in order to feed him during combat.<br><br>A variant is to get MOnk at level 2 instead of 6, you will get some AC, Evasion and Flurry of Blows sooner, but the shift a little later.<br>_________________<br>The world is full of lies! “Thou shalt not kill”, “Thou shalt not steal”. These are all deceptions. “I don't want to be killed”, “I don't want to be a victim of theft”, that is why they use lies like justice and morals to protect their weak selves.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 06/20/08 21:49</span></i></p>

Cleric 26/Rogue 14 (Cleric 12/Rogue 8<i></i>)  dexer, epic dodger, dual wielder will do. Human, STR 10, DEX 16 (28), CON 10, WIS 16 (20), INT 14, CHA 8 with trickery and war/str/travel domains. Unbuffed AB 37, AC 29 (naked)/32 (tower shield). Buffs will give you +1/+2 (if travel domain is taken) extra attacks, enough extra dmg to cover a dexer's low dmg output, all the AB and AC you want and you will have your personal set of +5 magic gear plus immunities. If you feel cheesy, add 1 monk lvl and dual wield kamas with a naked AC of 34. IT will cost you -1 AB, but it's worth it.<br><br>BTW, get yourself scribe scrolls: you'll have all the heals you need, among the rest <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 06/20/08 22:50</span></i></p>

Indeed, I copied it from another of my Druid builds, but that one was a spellcaster so it had both focuses.
