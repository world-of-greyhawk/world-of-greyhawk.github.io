Why are there no Constitution based Dwarven Defender builds out there?  I know there are some people here, including myself, that would love to see a Ftr10/DD30 build that is the juggernautiest of them all.<br><br>King Harbromm

probably because of the lack of offense.  there are a few DD builds with decent CON scores (22 is the highest in recent memory), but going really high, to lets say 26 or 30, is usually not practical.  your str (or dex) is low enough to make you fairly worthless in combat.  and the high number of DWD levels needed to get a decent DR makes using other classes for offense difficult.  over all, there are a number of great DWD builds, but they usually are not as popular nor as powerful as other characters with a few spells at their disposal.<br><br>that being said, if you have a build that doesn't nerf offense, than post it.  you might just teach everyone the power of the DWD with a strong offence and defense.<br><br>-c
