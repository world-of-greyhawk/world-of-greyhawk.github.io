Luke felt confident. He had been on trial and he was aquitted. Surely, someone with his style of combat had been killing innocents and guards alike, but he had an alibi for most of them. Of course being the king’s personal bodyguard helps a lot, as you’re amongst people most of the times. He felt confident. He was sharpening his Kukri’s as he heard commotion down the hall. Alert for danger he sheathed his kukri’s and went to see what is was about. In the dim hallway he saw some women looking startled out of a window. He went there and saw why they were so upset. The guards in the garden looked like nothing more than a bloody mess. He had seen it before. It was how he left his enemies behind usually, with their internal organs flooding the battlefield and their heads a good few meters from their body.<br>It was time. The time had come that the unkown warrior with similar style had come to challenge him. Luke, the bodyguard of the king, the Kukri Master of the empire. He went to the throne hall. He had been off-duty, yet his first priority was off-course to protect the king.<br>He went in to see the king nervously sitting on his throne. “They say he has come, Luke, the Warrior from the darkside. He has come for me!”. Luke was about to comfort him with his words as a side door opened. In came a large character. Muscles like a tiger’s. Wings like a dragon’s. He was wearing a black mask. Luke felt certain that if he was to bargain with this character over his kukri’s, he’d have to pay a high price. Not that it really mattered.<br>“No king, I did not come for you, I came for Luke. Face me!”<br>A short battle began. First the dragon started singing. This surprised Luke very much. Next the winged, black masked character, taunted him with words and laughs, making him drop his guard. And as the character drew closer, and the singing continued, Luke, however, felt confident. But alas, he knew how to block the first few blows, but eventually one came through. He watched in horror as this time HIS internal organs flooded the battlefield. With his dying breath he managed to ask: “How did you beat me? Who are you?”<br>“Luke,”, the character said, breathing heavily behind his mask,” I am your father!”<br><br><i>Come to the dark side, we have cookies!</i><br><br><br>Similar builds, by pulscap’s <b>new</b> search engine, these are the builds with at least 20 fighter lvls. Even some that have 2 kukri’s (as an option). I’m still posting my build, because it has a certain perspective and that is comparing it to the <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_kukrimaster.html" target="_blank">kukri master</a> of the epic character’s builds page. When examining that particular build, I felt that a FtrBrdRdd should do better, especially in a low-magic environment, due to being able to self buff. Besides that, my build gets UMD, so even in a high magic environment he has more options. So, first the similar builds, with special attention to Cinnabar Din’s Master of resistance, which opened my eyes to the possibilities of a Ftr/Brd/Rdd. I have been playing around with the lvl’s, choice of race and more, to finally come up with my own build.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "212801", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Great Wyrm (Brd 10 / RDD 10 / Fig 20)</a><br>-- aquamoeba<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "253315", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Draco the Tempest (Fig 26 / Brd 4 / RDD 10)</a><br>-- blixen71<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "202966", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Master of Resistance (Fig 22 / Brd 8 / RDD 10)</a><br>-- Cinnabar Din<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "214152", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Dualist (Fig 24 / Brd 8 / RDD 8<i></i>)    </a><br>-- Cinnabar Din<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "278312", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Whirling Dever (Fig 28 / Brd 2 / RDD 10)</a><br>-- gorche<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "220967", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Versatile Draconic Warrior (Fig 22 / Brd 8 / RDD 10)</a><br>-- Jennalee<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "186741", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Dragoon Cavalier (Fig 29 / Brd 1 / RDD 10)</a><br>-- Sarlak<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "172361", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Draconic Warrior (Fig 28 / Brd 2 / RDD 10)</a><br>-- SlimReaper<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117531", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Dragon Warrior (Fig 28 / Brd 2 / RDD 10)</a><br>-- Spooky222<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "218653", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Munchkin the Dwarf Dragon Wannabe (Fig 28 / Brd 2 / RDD 10)</a><br>-- Xylophone<br><br>And now for my own build, I had PvM in mind, but he shouldn’t do bad in PvP either, yet I have not tested this. Besides, if you’re playing in a dev crit environment, you shouldn’t be surprised to be dev critted yourself, which can be a pain with your fortsave as it is. I found him playable throughout his career, although the first ten levels or so, he faced some toughies, due to his low strength.

Also I’ve taken My 7th lvl of bard at 33 as opposed to 32, because this will give you a Cha score of 13 (from RDD 10), meaning you can pick your 3rd lvl spells at lvl 33 as opposed to 40.<br><br>In fighting abilities, I differ from the Kukri Master (KM). He gains expertise (which I find fairly useless) spring att (but look at my tumble score) and Whirlwind att. I on the other hand gain KD and IKD as special combat maneuver, which I find very useful and blind-fight, which is a huge advantage IMHO. <br><br>Skill distribution:<br><br>Discipline: 43 (57)<br>Tumble 40 (42)<br>Lore 8 (19)<br>Search 20 (23)<br>Spellcraft 43 (46)<br>UMD 43 (44)<br>Perform 14 (15)<br>Taunt: 29 (30)<br><br>Skillpoints: 240<br><br><br>HP: max: 512(520 with Bard song) (KM: 640)<br><br>Naked AC:----AC (KM): <br>10---------------10<br>+8 (tumble)----+4 (tumble)<br>+2 dex----------+2 dex<br>+4 RDD--------+2 Armor skin<br>------------------+1 dodge<br>AC: 24 --------KM AC: 19<br>With full plate:<br>AC: 31	---------KM AC: 26<br><br>So my AC is higher, plus I get the Dragon Abilities, immune to fire, paralysis and sleep. To further help my defenses, I have access to UMD with a total score of 45 when buffed with eagle’s splendor, allowing use of items with a value of 1,400,000 (alignment) 1,800,00 (race) or 2,200,000 (class) or lower.<br><br>AB with mundane kukri’s<br>28 BAB--------30 BAB<br>+ 14 STR------+8 STR<br>+ 1 WF---------+1 WF<br>+ 2 EWF-------+2 EWF<br>+ 1 EP	---------+1 EP<br>-2 dual wield----2 dual wield<br>------------------+5 WM boni<br>AB: 44	---------KM AB: 45<br><br>So he is only one AB short of  a WM heavy build, BUT my character gets to buff himself, with Bard Song (+2 ab), Bull’s strength (at least +1) and Greater magic Weapon (+2) for an AB of 49 (self-buffed), which is higher than the Kukri Master can achieve by himself and lastly, my build can use taunt to lower the opponents AC to a maximum of -6<br><br>Damage output (mundane kukri’s):<br><br>1d4-----------------------1d4<br>+14 Str	------------------+8 str<br>+6 WS/EWS--------------+6 WS/EWS<br>=21-24	-------------------=15-18<br><br>But again: I can buff, so my damage after buffing will be (e.g.)<br>+2 bard song<br>+2 GMW<br>+1 Bull’s<br>For an average of 26-29 damage. This will give my build a greater edge against crit immune monsters/players.<br><br>Damage output on a crit hit (mundane kukri)<br>21-24--------------------15-18<br>x 2------------------------x 3<br>44-48--------------------45-54<br>+1-6 overw. Crit------+2-12 ov crit<br>45-54--------------------47-60<br>After buffing:<br>26-29<br>x 2<br>52-58<br>+1-6<br>53-64--------------------(still)47-60<br><br>So even though the Kukri Master, get’s a x3 multiplier, my build still gets a higher damage output on a critical hit. However, this will rapidly change the higher the magic weapons available! Furthermore notice that the Kukri Master does not have the ability to make his weapons keen, yet my build does, making his crit range 12-20 (after buffing) as opposed to 13-20 for the Kukri Master. And don’t forget my higher (buffed) AB (especially with taunt), so I’ll likely hit more crit’s than he does, even if we obtain keen kukri’s, which would give him a 10-20 crit range.<br><br>Now, what you’ve been waiting for: the dev crit DC:<br>My build:------10+20+14 = 44 (at least 45 buffed)<br>KM:------------10+20+8 = 38<br><br>So even though he claims to have mastered the Kukri I beat his DC by far and can be buffed. With his own fort save of 30, he needs to roll 15 or higher, to prevent me from killing him. On the other hand if he succeeds in critting me, I’ll have to roll a (38-28=)10 or higher. The odds are in my favor when I confront him, especially considering my higher AC and his lower AB and my ability to Taunt him good.<br><br>Saves (singing	)(vs. spells)	KM:<br>Fort: 27 (28)---(37)------------30<br>Refl: 22 (23)---(32)------------29		<br>Will: 23 (24)---(33)------------20<br><br>So, my reflex and fort are lower, but my will save is higher. Furthermore, mine are better against spells. Any saving throw boosting item is welcome though, as is an item giving evasion.<br><br>So here is my first build on the guild, I think it’s better than the Kukri Master. Feel free to comment. Now if they only hadn’t closed down the Epic Character Builds forum I might have mine posted there <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     ...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 05/30/09 19:10</span></i></p>

I changed some stuff then changed things again and forgot wisdom. I know there is alot about IKD, but really, who needs it?

You could just lower WIS to 8 and INT to 13 to start with 15 STR (net +2), which still leaves enough INT for IKD and you won't lose any HP. Skill-wise, you take more stuff than you need anyway.<br><br>It's tough to compare any Dev Critter to a Weapon Master, but I'd say you shouldn't focus so much on besting those old builds, I've never seen anybody here gloating the builds over there are godly.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 05/31/09 19:55</span></i></p>

But since that was the (only) aim of your build, why you didn't go heavier on bard is beyond me. Going Fighter14/Bard16/RDD10 (oh yeah, it's been done many times), dropping dual-wielding over shield and whammo. You wouldn't even be seeing the kukri master in your rearview mirror anymore. If you must dual wield, then I'm not sure if you get enough feats for it in that version, but that's easy to check.<br><br>*edit* LoH, Toughness and IKd at least are all expendables right there. That's already 6 fighter shaven off already, so I bet it can be done.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 06/01/09 15:31</span></i></p>
