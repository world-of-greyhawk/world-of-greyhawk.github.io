This is my first post here. I have been browsing the forums for some time looking for ideas though. I have never played a character past level 30 so I dont know how good this character is in those levels but in the OC and HotU I found him to be very good. The inspriation comes from this build, very similar but a different list of feats and race. <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "172443", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Anyway on to the build<br><b>Playable from level 1 - 40 PvM at least tested to 30</b><br><br>Human, TN<br><br>Stats:<br><br>STR 16 (36)<br>DEX 12<br>CON 12 (14)<br>INT 14 (16)<br>WIS 10<br>CHA 12 (14)<br>Skills: Discipline, Spellcraft, Tumble, UMD to max 10 ranks in perform minimum 8 in lore.

For your first build this is extremely good. The only down side is that you cant expand on the PM as good as a wizard can. But you get all the benefits anyway making him a versatile fighter. However I would consider moving the levels around of the PM and adding them to bard so you get more spell casting ability, a better bardsong and more out of you combination of classes. Also you could take curse song and put skills into concentration (which has a double effect) if you decided to do this.<br><br>For example 17 bard, 10 RDD, 13 PM. This takes the most out of the bard and PM. But you lose 3 feats. However you gain the equivalent with the bard levels. Also more skills can be taken.<br><br>....    ....    ....     ....    ....    ....    ....    ....    ....    ....     ....<br><i>griphook ..

Yeah I thought about taking more bard levels. Would be a more flexible character. Trouble is casting in armour. Bard song may perhaps give the character the same effective AC as the plalemaster levels in the end. When I played HotU I used scrolls as there were plenty. <br>What do you mean concetration skill has double effect?<br>I also thought about not taking armour prof heavy and use medium armour, not a great loss and then take imp knockdown instead.<br>I guess still spell feat is an option also and skip knockdown altogether perhaps.<br>You are correct I think. The level split you mention is probably a better one. I lose epic warding which of course can be good but this character doesn't get hit very often anyway.<br>Will try that now!<br>Thanks<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bruce Lee 72 on 09/18/05 14:14</span></i></p>

Interesting build, and well done. Your saves vs spells are +8 on top of the Bard Song boost as well (due to Spellcraft bonus), so you've got a good batch of saves going there too. If you pop 1 more point into it, your boosted Spellcraft will be 45 (you get +1 to skills from your Bard Song) for a further +1 to the saves vs spells.<br><br>One thing I'll point out: a modified Tumble of 14+ will negate AoOs from moving in combat only. You still generate them from other activites (depending on your game settings) like firing a ranged weapon in melee, drinking a potion, reading a scroll, etc. Tumble doesn't help against those AoOs. Just thought I'd mention it, as many people are under the impression that high Tumble ranks stop all of those AoOs.<br><br>Nicely done. Kudos.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Okay so skill bonus from bard song can really also boost saves vs spells. Good to know. <br>How about cursed song, can the penalty to skills worsen tumble ac bonus on enemies? <br>Saves bonus from spellcraft must be worsened by curse song right?

Nice! One less bard level gives you one more epic spell I see. I picked a bard level in the late 20's because I played through HotU and wanted to max skills there, for level 40 yours is better I think. I guess my song is better but no big difference.<br>Anyway why would this build be better for PvP. MOnsters can generally never hit an AC like this.

One last thing: Is there any difference between taking a Katana and a Bastard Sword? They seem to do the same thing, except that bastard swords look cooler. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">
