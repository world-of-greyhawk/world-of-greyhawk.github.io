Dusting off my old build projects, I had been working on a number of shifter alternatives (ie, non-monk shifters, non-wisdom shifters, etc).  I managed to refine this one well enough to consider it worth posting for comment <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>This build is designed to favor the Epic Kobold Commando shifter shape.  By using Bard as the third class in the build, I can get stealth skills, discipline, taunt, and UMD as well as useful buffs including bard song/curse song (which can both be sung while shifted).<br><br><b>Playable 1-40 in PvE, but there will be some rough points</b>.  Not a PvP build.  Will be best compared to other builds in low-magic or mid-magic environments, like most shifters.<br><br>Human, Neutral, non-Lawful<br><br>Str 14<br>Dex 8<br>Con 16<br>Int 14<br>Wis 10<br>Cha 14<br><br>1 Bar (1): Weapon Prof (Martial), Lingering Song*<br>2 Bar (2):<br>3 Bar (3): Curse Song<br>4 Bar (4): +1 con<br>5 Dru (1):<br>6 Dru (2): Weapon Focus (Short Sword)%<br>7 Dru (3):<br>8 Dru (4): +1 con<br>9 Dru (5): Alertness<br>10 Shi (1):<br>11 Shi (2):<br>12 Shi (3): +1 con, Blind-Fighting<br>13 Shi (4):<br>14 Shi (5):<br>15 Shi (6): Knockdown<br>16 Shi (7): +1 con<br>17 Bar (5):<br>18 Bar (6): Improved Knockdown*<br>19 Bar (7):<br>20 Bar (8): +1 con<br>21 Shi (8): Epic Prowess<br>22 Shi (9):<br>23 Shi (10):<br>24 Shi (11): +1 con, Armor Skin<br>25 Shi (12):<br>26 Shi (13): Undead Shape+<br>27 Bar (9): Epic Weapon Focus (Shortsword)%<br>28 Shi (14): +1 con<br>29 Shi (15):<br>30 Shi (16): Epic Damage Reduction 1, Great Wisdom 1+<br>31 Shi (17):<br>32 Bar (10): +1 cha<br>33 Bar (11): Epic Damage Reduction 2<br>34 Bar (12):<br>35 Bar (13):<br>36 Bar (14): +1 cha, Epic Damage Reduction 3<br>37 Bar (15):<br>38 Shi (18):<br>39 Shi (19): Epic Skill Focus (Taunt)*, Great Wisdom 2+<br>40 Bar (16): +1 con<br><br>* - Optional Feat<br>+ - Shifter Epic Bonus Feat<br>% - Shortsword/martial prof chosen to specialize in Kobold Form.

And without dragon?  Are you insane?  Isn't this begging for gimpyness?</b><br>A:  I think the stats more or less speak for themselves... this character is able to provide pretty significant party support via their bard abilities, is a top-flight stealth character, and is an above-average melee combatant in kobold form... and that's ignoring situations where some of the other shapes come in handy.<br><br><b>Q:  Why take so many shifter levels if you are focusing mainly on one form?</b><br>A:  You don't get the epic kobold form until shifter level 17 anyway, and two more levels yield you a shifter epic bonus feat.<br><br>The two shifter bonus feats at shifter 16 and 19 go to great wisdom to allow you to cast your druid spells, which while minor are still useful (particularly bark skin).  This makes the most of those feats, since the only other option you'll have at that point is epic energy resistance.<br><br><b>Q:  But why not make it bard 18/shifter 17/druid 5?</b><br>A:  A viable build also, but you'll have to figure out a new stat progression if you want your druid spells.  This variant would have more bard spells/day (and get to cast level 6 bard spells without +cha equipment), and a somewhat better bardsong.  If that's your cup of tea, go for it.<br><br><b>Q:  What about the other shapes?</b><br>A:  I didn't test them extensively, but I would expect them to be useful situationally - just that most of them are probably nowhere nearly as good as the kobold shape in this build.  You have enough shifter levels to make the wyrmling breaths worthwhile, and the epic gargoyle plus EDR 3 will be a very tough DR tank.<br><br>The other epic humanoid shapes are also pretty good, but the kobold really shines in this particular build - layer a curse song and a taunt on your opponent, and you can IKD them very reliably to get the sneak attacks.  He also gets a good bonus to his stealth skills and the HIPS feat, as well.<br><br><b>Q:  Why take undead shape?</b><br>A:  Because you haven't really got anything better to do with that bonus feat, and the undead shape immunities can come in very handy in many situations.  Your EDR will make the Risen Lord an even better tank than normal, and immunity to death magic and critical hits is a Good Thing.  And you can leverage your curse song's save penalty with the vampire's domination gaze and level drain bite.<br><br><b>Q:  Are you sure this build is playable?</b><br>A:  Some environments might be too hard for it, since neither bards nor non-epic shifters are exactly powerhouse classes.  However you do get your best shape at level 31, and have undead shape at 26 to help out as well, so it's not hopeless.  As a guesstimate, I think any environment where this build would make an attractive final character, will also be reasonably playable for it.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Originally I did it that way, but the great wisdom feats are shifter epic bonus feats.<br><br>The only shifter epic bonus feats this character can take are Great Wisdom, Undead Shape (which you take at levl 26) and Epic Energy Resistance.<br><br>So starting with a 12 wisdom just frees you to take epic energy resist... you don't get any metamagic out of it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"><br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
