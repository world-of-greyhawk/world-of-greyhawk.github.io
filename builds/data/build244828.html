Please note that this is not a copy of fin's <i>very</i> recently posted Halfling Vindicator. I came up with this concept, while trying to figure out a way to make a decent dex-based paladin. <br><br>This build is only a halfling because I chose to use one. In reality, elf would be far more appropriate, as it would give you an additional 4 ability points at the start. Also, you would have no size penalties, and as such you could use shortswords instead of daggers.<br><br>I'm afraid that I've only played this build up to level 28, but I suspect it would still be moderately good afterwards. Also, due to this, I will be missing a few things (saves and AB mostly), just because I have nothing to refer to. If anyone else can figure it out without the build in front of them, that's fine by me.<br><br>I'd like to have played it more, but my computer seems to be permanently dead... as of now, I'm using my dad's old work computer, which barely meets the prerequisites to use cable internet, let alone run NWN.<br><br>That's enough moping for now, here's my build.<br><br><br><b>The Seraphic edge</b><br><br><i>Race:</i> Halfling (like I said earlier, it would probably be better with an elf)<br><br><b>Playble from level 3 - 40</b> (although in reality it doesn't really begin to make an impact until 12)<br><br>Works well in PvM and I suspect it would work alright in PvP.<br><br><i>Alignment:</i> Lawful Good<br><br><i>Stats</i><br>Str 13 <br>Dex 16 (26)<br>Con 8<br>Wis 8<br>Int 14<br>Cha 16 (22)<br><br><br><br><i>Leveling Guide</i><br><br>1  Rogue 1; Power Attack<br>2  Paladin 1<br>3  Paladin 2; Weapon Finesse<br>4  Paladin 3<br>5  Paladin 4; Dex +1<br>6  Paladin 5; Weapon Focus: Dagger<br>7  Rogue 2<br>8  Paladin 6; Dex +1<br>9  C.O.T 1; Ambidexterity<br>10 C.O.T 2; Knockdown<br>11 C.O.T 3<br>12 Rogue 3; Two-Weapon Fighting, Dex+1<br>13 C.O.T 4; Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>14 C.O.T 5<br>15 Paladin 7; Divine Might<br>16 C.O.T 6; Improved Critical: Dagger, Dex +1<br>17 Rogue 4<br>18 Paladin 8; Divine Shield<br>19 C.O.T 7<br>20 C.O.T 8; Blind-Fight, Dex +1<br>21 C.O.T 9; Great Dex I<br>22 Rogue 5<br>23 Rogue 6<br>24 Rogue 7; Great Dex II, Dex +1<br>25 Rogue 8<br>26 Rogue 9<br>27 Rogue 10; Great Dex III, Improved Evasion<br>28 Rogue 11; Dex +1<br>29 Rogue 12<br>30 Rogue 13; Defensive roll, Epic Dodge<br>31 Rogue 14<br>32 Rogue 15; Cha +1<br>33 C.O.T 10; Great Cha I, Epic Prowess<br>34 C.O.T 11<br>35 C.O.T 12<br>36 C.O.T 13; Great Cha II, Cha +1<br>37 C.O.T 14; Epic Weapon Focus: Dagger<br>38 C.O.T 15<br>39 C.O.T 16; Great Cha III<br>40 Rogue 16; Slippery Mind, Cha +1<br><br><i>Skills</i> - 286<br>Disable Trap 22<br>Hide 40<br>Listen 43<br>Move Silently 38<br>Open Lock 20<br>Search 40<br>Tumble 40<br>Use Magic Device 43<br><br>HP - 296 (maxed)<br><br>AC (Natural) - 26 (32 Divine Shield, 44 fully buffed DEX &amp; CHA)<br><br>AB - 39 (when dual-wielding mundane daggers, +6 for buffed dex, +7 for Divine Wrath)...

You need to drop Dodge/Mobility/Spring Attack for something more useful.

Yeah, drop what Finn says and I'd drop Slippery Mind too for Crippling Strike. <br><br>Why do you say it's playable from lvl 3 only?

To Fin, isn't dodge a prerequisite for epic dodge? As for mobility and spring attack, I actually forgot that with 48 ranks in tumble that spring attack would be practically useless, mobility was there just as a prerequisite for spring attack.<br><br>I think I'll probably swap mobility and spring attack for extra turning and epic prowess.<br><br>Okay, assuming I figured it out properly, these are the saves of this build.<br><br>(buffed CHA)<br>Fort 20, divine grace + modifiers <b>33</b>, buffed CHA 39<br>Refl 28, divine grace + modifiers <b>42</b>, buffed DEX &amp; CHA 54<br>Will 16, divine grace + modifiers <b>29</b>, buffed CHA 35<br><br>If there wrong, someone please tell me.<br><br>To kail, regarding it's playability, While it's true that it isn't really unlayable at level 1, with only a +1 bonus to hit and +1 damage, it would still be quite troublesome. As opposed to level 3, when it has weapon finesse and it's dagger/shortsword get's a +3 to hit instead.<br><br>Also as for swapping Slippery mind in favour of crippling strike, don't get me wrong, I'm all in favour of -2 strength per sneak attack (in fact, it's one of my favourite feats). But it didn't really seem very "paladin-esque", so slippery mind was taken more for flavour reasons.<br><br>Now that I think about it, sneak attacks on the whole aren't very paladin like, but they're somewhat unavoidable.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Big Meph on 06/23/06 23:06</span></i></p>

Hmmm... if you read the previous posts, you may notice that originally I thought dodge was a prerequisite for epic dodge, and I also had Spring attack. <br><br>Seeing as I'm getting rid of those, I might just take blindfight... but not knockdown.

I meant that i was not sure how much he was kidding, since Pal/CoT/PM is not possible. Dirty girl.... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>[/offtopic]This build is nice, but I find value in KD too, in a build with this amount of sneak-attavks. But there is also value in Extra Turning for sure, so it's tricky to get the choices right.....<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

If any mods have any free time, could they please make the following changes <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  ?<br><br>-Swap Dodge at level 10 for Knockdown<br>-Swap Mobility at level 20 for Blind-Fight<br>-Swap Spring Attack at 33 for Epic Prowess<br><br>Also, I wrote Great CHA III is taken at 38, which should be 39. And one quick last thing, could someone move the Saves I figured out to the OP.<br><br>I decided to take knockdown instead of extra turning, because with a buffed CHA modifier of +12 I figured that 15 turning attempts a day is good enough. Also, despite the fact that I can't knockdown anything as big or bigger then an ogre, it should still work fine in PvP.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Big Meph on 06/24/06 12:44</span></i></p>
