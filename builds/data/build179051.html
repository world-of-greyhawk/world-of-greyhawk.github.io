The twisted templar, so wholly devoted to the cause of defending the Church, has offered his own body and indeed part of his soul for fantastic strength. Gauging perhaps too confidently the limits of his powerful heart, he channeled a lesser demon, allowing it to possess his body. While it had the desired effect in that it gave him tremendous strength, unfortunately it was far stronger than he expected. With the passing of each day his body withers and his mind falters, but he holds onto what little he has left to defend the Church with outstanding ferocity. He lurks in the shadows, in the balconies, never entering the sanctuary except to beg for forgiveness.<br><br>I wanted to build something that mixed very high saves with immunity to critical, but that was a melee fighter, not a sorc/pali/pm sort of deal. I noticed there were no CoT/PM builds on the index, so I guess this is something new. A bit of a stretch RP-wise, but whatever. It would do best on a server where you can get evasion and damage resistance on items. Death immunity would be nice too.<br><br>True Neutral<br>Stats:<br>STR 16 (ends at 28)<br>DEX 8<br>CON 16<br>WIS 8<br>INT 12<br>CHA 14<br><br>Pre-epic Progression: 7 bard 2 pm 1 bard 10 CoT<br>Post-epic Progression: 8 PM 1 bard 10 CoT 1 bard<br><br>Skills:<br>40 Tumble<br>43 Discipline<br>40 Spellcraft<br>43 UMD<br>15 Perform (any more would be useless)<br><br>Feats:<br>1 Luck of Heroes, Toughness<br>3 Weapon Focus: Spear (2-hander backup for crit immune)<br>6 Energy Resistance: Acid<br>9 Energy Resistance: Fire<br>12 Energy Resistance: Cold<br>15 Energy Resistance: Lightning<br>18 Energy Resistance: Sonic<br>CoT pre-epic feats:<br>1 Weapon Focus: Warhammer<br>2 Improved Criticals: Warhammer<br>3 Armor Proficiency: Heavy Armor<br>4 Blind Fight<br>5 Power Attack<br><br>Post-epic feats:<br>21 Epic Weapon Focus: Warhammer<br>24 Great Strength<br>27 Great Strength<br>30 Epic Energy Resistance: Fire<br>33 Epic Energy Resistance: Acid<br>36 Epic Energy Resistance: Cold<br>39 Epic Energy Resistance: Acid (or lightning to work towards prismatic 15/- instead of 25/- acid)<br>Post-epic CoT feats (only every 4, despite manual...)<br>1 Armor Skin<br>2 Epic Prowess<br><br>Okay, stats:<br>Fortitude: 38 +8 v spells (stands up to 46 DC)<br>Reflex: 33 + 8 v spells (stands up to 41 DC)<br>Will: 32 + 8 v spells (stands up to 40 DC)<br>mundane, unbuffed:<br>AB/dmg: 40/35/30/25, 1-8+9 (19-20 x3)<br>Naked AC: 25<br>AC with mundane fullplate/tower shield: 36<br><br>You have a few basic buffs, including a bard song that gives you +2 ab and +2 damage, among other things.

Fortunately they aren't too great anyways.<br>AB isn't too great, and neither is damage. Okay... but not great. If you're up against something/someone crit immune, you can switch to your spear at a loss of 2 ab for a few more points of damage. Otherwise the 3x criticals on warhammer should help with your damage output.<br><br>There are a few alternative ways to go with this build. For one, you could take a different weapon. Another option might be to sacrifice some strength (6, in all) and 2 epic feats (one will simply be the Great Strength feat changed over) so that you can get epic dr III. Go for 21 con asap, then use three of your epic feats towards dr III. You end up with 22 strength, using 1 great strength feat to get there. It's a nice option, but your AC will be pretty high anyways, on top of your elemental resistances and immunity to criticals. So I’d stick to the way it is, and that’s why it is the way it is… You can boost saves even further pre-epic by using some of those resist energy feats for reflex/fort/will. You could even do the same post-epic. That, or pump strength four more times and get 2 more ab/damage. Up to you.<br><br>Oh and on a server that has dev. critical enabled... go for it. You have plenty of pre-epic feats to work with and those energy resistance feats post-epic certainly aren't worth missing out on dev. crit. Come to think of it why don't I just post those modifications next.<br><br><br>****   ****   ****   ****   ****   ****   ****   ****<br><br>(edited to correct typo in title,s class levels)<br>griphook <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/10/07 13:15</span></i></p>

Actually, have you checked out Mauvais Guillame's Haunted Hymnsinger of Torm?  I believe it's in the index.  <br><br>Also wanted to mention that if you were willing to take 16 PM you could not only get a better AC but Epic spells as well.  Epic Mage Armor isn't all that great if you can get +5 items, but Epic Warding is awesome.

Ya going 14 bard/16 pm/10 cot might be a good level 40 variation. You get epics liek mentioned above, as well as a maxed bard song.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Well, it's up to the player, ultimately, but he already has pretty high AC, and so I consider the saves more valuable. He'd lose one epic feat (used on the epic spell) for something that in the end probably isn't as valuable as the saves. With the prismatic immunities, immunity to criticals, and already high ac, he's going to stand up quite well to melee/archer characters as it is, so I'd consider saves a better investment, especially since he's going to have to last against mages because he's somewhat low on the damage-output side. A mage with really high DCs would be far more of a problem if he lost the saves.<br><br>And yeah, I guess that build is fairly similar, though not so much so in feat choices. I could've sworn I didn't see any CoT/PM mixes when I looked through. I like the compromise though, at 7 saves from CoT with the epic spell from PM. Perhaps a bit more balanced.<br>Though I'd definitely suggest one of my two feat progression options, and the use of heavy armor. You gain 11 ac in all and lose the ability to cast your practically worthless bard spells. Also my build ends up with 1 more base damage and 2 more ab (epic prowess, and 2x great strength). Other than that, I'd say the 14/16/10 cot/pm/bard mix is definitely a nice option.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

Why not take 10bard/12PM/18COT?<br>Effectively gives you +2 AC.

Yes, you will notice how I discussed extra PM levels in the post previous to yours.<br>Oh and thanks griphook.
