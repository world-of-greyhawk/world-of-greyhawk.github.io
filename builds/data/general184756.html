The same as it would be for any other Dual Wielding character!<br><br>You should be more specific in your request.<br><br>Size, Race - normal sized or small (halfling, gnome)?<br>Classes - are you multiclassing?<br>Style - Strength based cleric or spell casting cleric.<br><br>Dueal Wielding also applies to the double-weapons as far as I remember - so double-sword/axe, dire mace also counts as dual wielded wapons.

Well, I don't if this is the ultimate, but it would certainly work.  It's basically a Dex-based version of the Harbinger build, Dwarven rather than Human to avoid an XP penalty.  <br><br><br>Rogue 17/Fighter 8/Cleric 15<br>(Rogue 3/Fighter 4/Cleric 13 pre-epic)<br><br><br>Race: Dwarf<br><br>Domains: War and Trickery<br><br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 10 <br>Dex 16<br>Con 16<br>Int 14 <br>Wis 14<br>Cha 6<br><br>+4 Wis, +6 Dex<br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 26<br>Con 16<br>Int 14 <br>Wis 18<br>Cha 6<br><br><br>1 Two-Weapon Fighting<br>3 Weapon Finesse, Ambidexterity *<br>6 Weapon Focus: Shortsword, Knockdown *<br>9 Extend Spell<br>12 Improved Crit: Shortsword<br>15 Blind-Fight <br>18 Toughness, Weapon Spec *<br>21 Epic Weapon Focus<br>22 Epic Weapon Spec * <br>24 Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>27 Great Dex I  <br>30 Great Dex II<br>32 Improved Evasion **<br>33 Great Dex III<br>35 Crippling Strike (or Skill Mastery) **<br>36 Great Dex IV <br>38 Defensive Roll ** <br>39 Epic Dodge<br>40 Epic Prowess *<br> <br>* Fighter bonus feat<br>** Rogue bonus feat <br><br>AB: <br><br>25 base<br>+8 Dex <br>+1 WF <br>+2 EWF<br>+1 Epic Prowess<br>-2 Dual-Wield<br>_______<br>35 AB w/ mundane Shortswords<br><br>+5 Divine Power<br>+5 Divine Favor<br>+5 Greater Magic Weapon<br>+1 Bless<br>+1 Aid<br>+1 Prayer<br>+2 Battletide<br>+2 Aura of Vitality<br>+1-2 Cat's Grace<br>_______<br>58-59 AB fully buffed<br><br><br>Equipment:<br><br>Robes, preferably Robes of the Dark Moon<br>Keen Short Swords<br><br><br>Skills:  <br><br>Concentration: 43<br>Craft Trap:    38<br>Discipline:    43<br>Healing:       20 <br>Spellcraft:    43<br>Set Traps:     38  <br>Tumble:        40<br>UMD:           27<br><br>Total skill credits: 292<br>  <br><br>A few notes:  <br><br>1) Craft Trap and Set Trap are great skills, but are most useful if you take Skill Mastery.  If you choose to take Crippling Strike, they're not quite as useful, although you could certainly still make use of them.  <br><br>The only thing you may have trouble with without the Skill Mastery feat would be trying to use Epic traps while in combat (not that you really strictly need Epic traps).  <br><br>2) Although personally I kind of like Dwarves for the boost to Con and the fact that you don't get an XP penalty, you could get a better AB and AC by going Halfling.  <br><br>If you were to drop Con and Int 2 points each at creation, you could start with as much as 18 Dex, which would get you +1 to AB and AC, and of course you would get another +1 to AB and AC from the Small Stature feat.  Note that you wouldn't want to dual-wield Shortswords with a Halfling as this would give you a -4 penalty; Daggers would be a better choice.  <br><br>3) I didn't put any points into Hide/Move Silently because you have spells for that (Darkness/Ultravision, Imp. Invis.) as well as Knockdown.  That said, if you were playing or a world that nerfs True Seeing, you might actually find it useful to put some points into those skills, particularly if you're going to be engaging in PvP.

Cleric with 4 levels of monk and 4 levels of ranger can dual wield kamas to a pretty nasty effect buffed while boosting saves in the process. This should net you a nice attack bonus flurrying, a good AC if you are wisdom based and lots of stacking damage.
