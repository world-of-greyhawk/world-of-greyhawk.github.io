The POETIC BLADE (Double-Weapon Master)<br>By Deborah "Tyr" Templar<br><br>This character, Poetic Blade, is a tweak from one of my earlier power bard characters, the Blade; accordingly, Poetic Blade joins my Fighting Bard Series. This one’s inspired by Sir Kail, insofar as he opined that it would be nice to see a power Blade character with two weapons of choice in lieu of dev crit; and so, here s/he is: Poetic Blade, a fighting bard and double weapon master, with exciting AB and the ability to dish out not only some rather awesome damage, but to also switch weapons on a moment’s notice and equip a tower shield; this, to gain the benefit, added protection and utility of being able to use a big board, while still being able to dish out very good str-based damage. Without further adieu, please meet the Poetic Blade (the Double Weapon Master).<br><br>Note: To see Blade, with links provided also to his/her companions in my fighting bard series,<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "246241", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Poetic Blade -- Overview<br>Fighter(11), Bard(1), Weapon Master(28)<br><br>Race: Human / Alignment: Any Non-Lawful (Theme: True Neutral or Neutral Good)<br><br><br>Final Stats:<br>STR: 18 (34)*<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 13<br>CHA: 8<br><br><br>Level Guide: <br><br>01: Fighter(1): dodge, weapon proficiency exotic, weapon focus: scythe<br>02: Fighter(2): mobility<br>03: Fighter(3): power attack<br>04: Fighter(4): STR+1, spring attack, (STR=19)<br>05: Fighter(5)<br>06: Fighter(6): expertise, whirlwind attack<br>07: Weapon Master(1): weapon of choice: scythe<br>08: Weapon Master(2): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>09: Weapon Master(3): knockdown<br>10: Weapon Master(4)<br>11: Weapon Master(5)<br>12: Weapon Master(6): STR+1, weapon focus: longsword, (STR=21)<br>13: Weapon Master(7)<br>14: Weapon Master(8)<br>15: Weapon Master(9): improved critical: scythe<br>16: Weapon Master(10): STR+1, (STR=22)<br>17: Fighter(7)<br>18: Fighter(8): weapon specialization: scythe, improved knockdown<br>19: Fighter(9)<br>20: Fighter(10): STR+1, blind fight, (STR=23)<br>21: Weapon Master(11): Great Strength I, (STR=24)<br>22: Weapon Master(12)<br>23: Weapon Master(13): epic weapon focus: scythe<br>24: Fighter(11): STR+1, epic weapon specialization: scythe, (STR=25)<br>25: Weapon Master(14)<br>26: Weapon Master(15)<br>27: Weapon Master(16): Great Strength II, epic weapon focus: longsword, (STR=26)<br>28: Weapon Master(17): STR+1, (STR=27)<br>29: Weapon Master(18)<br>30: Weapon Master(19): Great Strength III, weapon of choice: longsword, (STR=28)<br>31: Weapon Master(20)<br>32: Weapon Master(21): STR+1, (STR=29)<br>33: Weapon Master(22): Great Strength IV, epic prowess, (STR=30)<br>34: Weapon Master(23)<br>35: Weapon Master(24)<br>36: Weapon Master(25): STR+1, Great Strength V, epic toughness I, (STR=32)<br>37: Weapon Master(26)<br>38: Weapon Master(27)<br>39: Weapon Master(28): Great Strength VI, epic toughness II, (STR=33)<br>40: Bard(1): STR+1, (STR=34)<br><br>---<br><br>Skillpoints: 174<br>Disable Trap 1(2), Discipline 43(55), Hide 1(2), Intimidate 4(3), Open Lock 1(2), Perform 4(3), Spellcraft 33(34), Tumble 40(41), UMD 41(40)<br><br>----<br><br>II.

Tyr, this is a nice idea, but it is not exactly a bard meleeist!  One level does not a bard make... <br>without the smell of cheese, i mean!  <br><br>imho, it is always nice, if you are goin 2 weapons, to take 2 different types of damage.  I know scythe does have some pierce, it is just my preference.  Also, it would be an idea to take ws/ews in longsword in lieu of 2 gr str.  Yes you loose 1 ab, but you would gain +5 damage with longsword and loose +1 dam with scythe, which is a fair trade imo.<br><br>The concept really reminds me of the PRC MAN AT ARMS class.  THough that class uses 4 weapn focuses.  You would probably love the prc!  Too bad its almost time for nwn2..<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

I would suggest you drop 3 WM levels for 3 Fighter levels and get epic weapon specialization in both your weapons.  I agree with Avado on chosing different weapons.  Either, go for weapons that do different damage types, so a bludgeoning weapon instead slashing. Or, pick a weapon with a large threat range like a scimitar, that way you chew up the mobs with the scimitar and whip out the scythe for the big enemies.<br><br>Other than that it looks good.  Well done Tyr.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 08/26/06 20:29</span></i></p>

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">       <br><br>He be pretty darn awesome, alright (thanks, Mith: and he even has a song (ok, a slight one, but a song <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    ). As to the weapon ideas, neat. And I agree, totally a matter of personal choice, but yer choices be good ones: different damage or scimmy you say? Alright, then: easilly done. Change longsword for warhammer (bludgeon) or scimmy, or whatever your pleasure. Only reason I put in longsword is b/c it's a good all-arounder, permitting board use; by all means, feel free to change it (and neat suggestions - thanks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">       <br><br>As to AB/droppin WM for ie extra damage on a one-hander, nah, he gets awesome damage on the scythe, which be his main weapon, and I *like* his power AB +53 (that'd be AB 79 capped); not worth droppin' AB for a mere couple of points of damage on our secondary weapon, especially when there's no need for it (uh, why else max out UMD, ya know? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      Speaking of damage, I made a mistake on the damage, cheatin' ya out of some points (sorry, folks; but PM sent, and here be those numbers):<br><br>MUNDANE SCYTHE<br>2d4 + 24 (Piercing and Slashing Damage), +1 Bard Song: <br>or, 27-33 damage per attack, x’s up to 5 APR (w. haste) <br>CRIT: 17-20/x5 (15-20/x5 keen), or: 135-165 dam. per crit<br><br>That said, if for some odd reason you’re not as excited about the scythe as I am (x5 crit damage? Seriously, just look at it and tell me it's not to love? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">      ). BUT, for those of you who've yer heart set on a greataxe or something, then you not need exotic weap., and can in turn enhance yer one-handed weapon as follows: <br><br>Level 1 – drop EWP, taking WF i.e. warhammer (or other one-hander weapon) and WF greataxe or greatsword; having switched weapons, adjust as follows: <br>as for the two-hander, adjust levels 23 and 24 to reflect this change;<br>as for the one-hander, adjust levels 27 and 30 to reflect this change.<br><br>Level 7 – whichever two-hander you chose be yer WM WOC<br>Level 12- take imp crit w resp. to two-hander of choice<br>Level 15- take imp crit w resp. to one-hander of choice <br>Level 18- take weap. specialization in both weapons, i.e., two-hander &amp; one-hander<br><br>Whatever may be your weapons, Enjoy! ~ Tyr (and thanks!)<br><br>ps. If ya wants more bard, well, I built one for just about everyone in my Blade/fighting bard series, as everyone here knows, and incl. a fighting laster!
