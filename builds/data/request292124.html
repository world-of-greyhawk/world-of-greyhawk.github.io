I've played A Dance w/ Rogues a 'few' times. But I'm curious how good a rogue could be made that meets it's requirements. In particular, I'm looking for a PC that would be playable in both that series and later SP mods.<br><br>The mods's restrictions, for those who don't know, are; human (female, not that it matters for the build), 14 dex minimum, 14 charisma minimum. I did a search, and found a couple that come close. But the ones I saw go elf or halfling, and would have to be rearranged some to be playable. Thanks in advance. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Oh, for playability, it must have consistently high rogue skills (especially pre-epic). It can be multi-classed, but the classic rogue skills and speech skills (especially persuade and bluff) need to be solid.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By RangerSG on 02/12/08 17:06</span></i></p>

How about some sort of Rogue/Blackguard?  You never said if it was to be evil, or good, but there's plenty of evil rogues out there, so this seems fitting.<br><br>Something like, 24 Rogue 10 Blackguard 6 Fighter would do swell, with Divine Might and possibly Divine Shield.  I honestly have no idea what mod you're talking about, so I can't decide how strong your build needs to be PvP/PvM wise.  But going 8 Rogue 4 Fighter 8 BG pre-epic would net decent AB, good saves, and enough feats.  Epic wise, you'd get EWS, and plenty of Rogue bonus feats.

PvP is irrelevant. This is strictly for SP mod play. She can't be totally gear dependant, since there's item strips involved. Sometimes for significant lengths of time. Alignment is not an issue, the series supports any align, though chaotic is the natural leaning.<br><br>I did a rogue/bg once it actually worked fairly well. Chosen of Cyric in fact (rogue/assassin/bg). I took that into "The God's Themselves" too, and she was fun. But I played with stats for that one. I don't want to do that this time. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  But something down those lines could work, yes.

Actually may I suggest rogue paladin.  A good number of buffs, not all damage is sneak, and you get to cast spells that enhance your weapon.

Re: Rogue/Paladin. Never be able to stay lawful realistically in the mod. Lots of actual thievery involved. <br><br>And I also am one of those who thinks if you sneak attack as a paladin, you're fallen by the code. But that's irrelevant for this, there's no way she'd go beyond level 5 before sliding to neutral...if that far. Someone tried a monk once for the series, it ended badly. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

Not much room for maneuvering with the requirements, especially since I know a Rogue with less than 14 INT is anathema to you. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>With that in mind, you're looking at something like this for starting stats:<br><br>STR 10<br>DEX 16<br>CON 10<br>INT 14<br>WIS 10<br>CHA 14<br><br>This leaves you with 2 points to drop elsewhere. I'd go with STR, as I hate being encumbered after looting the first chest I find. But you can put it anywhere, of course. As well, if you're not against a bit of min/maxing, you could drop WIS to 8 and have 2 more points to play with. (This would allow you to have 14 STR or 16 INT or 16 CHA, depending on where you want your focus. I'd be very tempted by the 16 INT myself).<br><br>Since Human gets an extra feat, you could take that bonus feat as Toughness to give yourself more HPs, or one of the save booting feats if you go for the low WIS option. (Or, you could say to heck with it and spend that feat on something entirely different, of course).<br><br>I'd personally grab a few levels of FTR for the extra HPs, boost to Fort save, bonus feats, and possibility to get a full attack routine, but it depends on your character concept as to which class you multiclass into, if any.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

*nods* Yeah, those are the typical starting stats. I will occasionally drop wis to 8. I don't really consider that min/maxing, since I already have the high charisma. It's not min/maxing to say your PC isn't good at "everything." <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>I could also get away with starting dex at 15, to keep the two weapon's line active, and then freeing up 2 more points.
