I would consider a Bard16/Cleric16/CoT8, or something along those lines.  16th Bard song is the quintessential party buff, and the 16th Curse Song is the perfect opponent de-buff.  No resistances, no dispels.<br><br>16 Cleric will give you max cleric buffs, and by taking War and Trickery, or Protection and Trickery, and you'll be quite an asset.  Take 4 CoT pre-epic for BaB and some feats, take 4 more in Epic to get either Great Wisdoms or EWF/Epic Prowess.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

We always forget about Druids in buffing... (sarcasm) I believe they have some weird spell that can increase all party members Str, Cons and Dex by 4... something about Vitality... Might want to try Bard 15/ Druid 17/ CoT 8... or a Cleric/ Druid build heavy on the Wisdom loads of spells for buffing and you can moonlight as a divine offensive powerhouse. I'm going to post one of my Cleric/ Druid builds soon... might want to look at it.<br><br>Another option is a Cleric/ Sorc/ Blackgaurd build if you are going evil.<br><br>ANd don't forget about that druids have the best summon in the game...

Druid17/Cleric17/monk6 everything into wisdom, give yourself zen archery. You can buff your party like there is no tomorrow. They can get dispelled but you have more and more spells.<br><br>BTW, that spell is aura of vitality, both druid and cleric (depends on domain) can get it<br><br>I made one but I dont think he is good enough to be in the character builds list.<br>_________________<br>HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh.

Hey I said sarcasm... I know my Druid spells and yes War Domain gets it... but you get much more with a Druid in my opinon.

No - Clerics get the better party buffs (just look at all those area of effect party AB boosts, undeath's eternal foe etc) while Druids really only get the better individual DR buffs (Greater Stoneskin, Premonition) which are really only good on low magic servers unless they modify the spells so that the DR scales too -_-. I wish Druids could get Epic Warding since they get the other DR spells. Clerics get tons more GOOD buffs compared to Druids and can get most of the good Druid spells to boot from Domains.

I like the druid/cleric/monk idea from fernandooa.  Perhaps travel and trickery domains for the mass haste and improved invis.  This would have to be human.  All great feedback, thanks.
