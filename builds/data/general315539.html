Hi all. Im playing my first druid/shifter build and I was wondering how I could boost my AB. While shifted, I get a pretty decent armor class with good equipement, but my AB sucks real hard and since I got no buffs to improve it I was wondering what I could do. Do more shifter lvls increase the stats of the forms you have?<br>_________________<br>K.M.  aka Chillychill<br><br>"Y'a pire que ne pas pouvoir, y'a savoir qu'on peut et ne jamais tenter"

If the shape has weapon merge, then merging a weapon with a high AB can also work.

Druid/Shifter is not so bad, use shifts with more Strength score. The only way to boost AB there is to take a third class pre-epic that gives you more BAB, but you won't gain a considerable amount anyway. Another helpful thing are buffs from a third class like Divine Wrath, but most of Cleric's AB buffs for example have low durations to use them shifted or are weapon-based. Blackguard can be a nice addition, considering all options it gives stackable Bull's Strength, high BAB profile, some sneak attack and bonus to saves from Charisma, but the alignment shift is usually very hard, if not impossible.<br><br>The thing here is why are you playing a Druid/Shifter, you don't pick those classes when you're looking for high AB. The shifter class excels in its versatility not in its high damage rating, I prefer by far a Druid/Monk, since Druid's shifts have high enough STR to hit (Bear -&gt; Dire Bear -&gt; Earth Elemental -&gt; Dragon) whereas shifter's shifts are more stylish (Bassilisk for petrify gaze, Rakshasa for infinite casting and spell immunity, etc) and not completely combat oriented. You don't need 40 different shifts if you only want AB and AC, so if you're on the Shifter path you shouldn't be aiming at stats, because the dragon form is the only one with superb ability scores, and Druid can get it fine without taking Shifter levels.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

There still are some options to get good ab with the shifter forms.  I like to use the kobold commando form because you can keep your own strength score with it.  Boost strength as much as you like and you can even take devastating crit if it is available.  Take whatever 3rd class that you would like to give it your own personal touch.  Doing this pretty much means you will be using kobold form most of the time, and it won't give you as much AC as being a wisdom based monk shifter, but your offense will be there.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DocRufio on 03/29/10 00:22</span></i></p>

The Risen Lord and the Iron Golem are the best combat shifts IMO. Using the Kobold Commando is not a bad idea, but then why not take a Fighter/Rogue build, it's basically the same thing.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

My goal isnt to have the highest AB a character can get, I have other toons that obviously have better AB than this build. My point is that while Im having a good versatility while shifted and a pretty decent AC, I just never hit anything. Then again, it might be the PW Im playing on that makes my shifters life so hard...<br>_________________<br>K.M.  aka Chillychill<br><br>"Y'a pire que ne pas pouvoir, y'a savoir qu'on peut et ne jamais tenter"

Check the enhancement level available on weapons. If you can get swords with +10 or more then that PW is not made for shifters. On the other hand, if you don't hit anything with an Iron Golem shape, then the PW is made for hardcore players, try a caster.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/30/10 03:32</span></i></p>
