OK having never made an Archer before I decided to give it a go...many go down the Monk avenue, using the extra monk speed to run away like cowards <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">   <br><br>So having thrown together my build I thought it would be a good idea to look and see if anyone had trodden the ground before so to speak...a quick seatch revealed this version: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "150088", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>This goes more down the cleric route, also using Zen Archery...I think overall the build I am about to outlay is a lot better overall, though it lacks 6th level spells.<br><br>So without any further ado, I introduce the <b>Divine Archer</b><br><br>Playable <b>1-40 PvM</b> though also performs admirably <b>PvP</b><br><br><b>the Divine Archer (cleric 9, bard 2, arcane archer 29)</b><br><br>Race : Half Elf (Elf may give a higher finishing Dexterity, however it would also give an XP penalty and further reduce HP)<br><br>Alignment : any Chaotic (for Bard levels)...Neutral is a better all round choice as it avoids Smite attacks, however slightly boring <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  I play this build as Chaotic Evil - maybe just because of the truely evil fully buffed attack bonus <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  ...or just my penchant for evil-laugh smilies!!!<br><br>Starting Statistics (final)<br><br>Str - 10 &lt;-----*<br>Dex - 18 (38)<br>Con - 10 &lt;-----*<br>Int - 10 &lt;-----*<br>Wis - 15<br>Cha - 8<br><br>*I decided setting Str, Con &amp;

err I think I was meaning Divine Favor...I did say there were probably some mistakes with the Cleric spell AB bonusses...however I didn't realise that there was a +20 AB cap...though it would seem logical as there is a +20 cap with pretty much everything else...thanks, still an AB of 84 isn't really too bad either though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"><br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!
