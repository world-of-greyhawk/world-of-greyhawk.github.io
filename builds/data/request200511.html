I made this character because I wanted to make a plain fighter and see what I could do with all the feats.<br>He's a melee character, Str based with a one hander and shield.<br>My wish list was:<br>Good AB and damage, with decent dev. crit. DC<br>Adaptability with different fighter moves (knockdown, disarm, expertise, PA) and different damage types (blunt backup weapon).<br>I also wanted to improve the saves of the plain fighter type, especially the low will and reflex saves.<br><br>I decided not to go pure fighter, but rather take 10 lvls of Champion of Torm before going epic. That gives better reflex saves and a sacred defence +5 to all saves.

With a starting Con of 18, it seems a waste not to take it up to 21 or 22, drop 3 existing epic feats and take all three epic damage reduction feats.

IMO drop a few of your feats and take a few DD levels. It will bring you more than 30 levels of pure fighter.<br><br>Having a high DR in addition to DevCrit is what you might be looking for <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while

I can think of a couple of things you could do right off the bat.  <br><br>One is change the dwarven waraxe for a weapon with a better critical threat range, e.g. long sword or scimitar.  You're taking devastating critical with that weapon , so a 17-20 or 15-20 threat range might serve you better than 19-20.  If you were a weapon master I would probably suggest you stay with waraxe, but, without the extended threat range, you are probably better off with a different primary weapon.  This will also free up a feat for you, I suggest great fortitude.  <br><br>Also switch two CoT levels to epic levels, increase your INT to 14 and drop your DEX to 9.  You can use a potion of cat's grace to get your DEX to 12, you can use the extra skill points to max out your spot skill.  Your saves will also stay the same since the fighter's reflex save increases at 12.<br><br>Try to take an epic fortitude.  If you take great fortitude and epic fortitude you can increase your fortitude saves to 38.  This will help you against devastating critical attacks.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

But the improved fortitude save will make a big difference against most dev. crit. opponents.<br>If I accept that cost, I might as well start out with STR 16, freeing 3 ability buy points for INT, DEX or WIS, ending up with STR 30 and Great strength IV. I will have to take the epic feats in a slightly different order, but it shouldn't cause any serious problems.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

With INT 14 the correct spellcraft rank is 18 (not 19). That frees 2 skillpoints.<br>I take fighter feats as general feats at lvl 12, 15 and 18. So it is possible to take both lightning reflexes and also skillfocus spellcraft, together with 20 spellcraft ranks to get +5 to saves vs spells from spellcraft, thus improving the saves further.<br>But the only fighter feat I think I can skip now without compromising the general idea of the build is IPA.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...
