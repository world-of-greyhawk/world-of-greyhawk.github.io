Can someone suggest a good combo to use for a wizard, just like the "exhalted sorcerer" build on Bioware's epic builds page? I'm interested in something that uses 38 or 39 levels of wizard, with another level or two that would complement the class's INT dependency, or anything else you'd think would be interesting.

One level of rogue, one level of either SD (HiPS) or Ftr (armour).<br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a>

Thanks - another big question, which feats would you  recommend with those extra classes (rogue or fighter)? <br><br>I think the fighter level would let you use armor (necessary for Auto still spell I-III later on), but I'm not sure about the reasoning behind rogue, unless it's just to get shadowdancer for HiPS (which would require the "sacrifice" of having to get feats in dodge &amp; mobility)?

The only real thing that could benefit from the great INT score is Death Attack, but it's impossible to fit in that in a caster build and with so much caster levels, you simply won't fight in melee as it's a very bad idea.<br><br>Rogue and SD should be nice, you'll get a ton of skills and HiPS, probably Bard and SD, or 2 levels of SD for Uncanny Dodge.<br><br>The reasoning behind Rogue is that he gets a lot of skills, just check his skill set, stuff like Use Magical Device (great skill), Set Traps, Pickpocket, etc, Bard can take the same job as it also gives a similar impressive skill set, 2 levels of rogue also gives you Evasion btw.<br><br>What do you mean with "feats with those extra classes"? they are taken for the boost they can provide with the short amount of levels, so keep all feats in spellcasting type, Fighter gives you an extra feat which should be no problem to allocate, since SD requires Dodge and Mobility, use the extra feat on either Dodge or Mobility.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 01/05/07 18:01</span></i></p>

Is HiPS really that worth it? I've never used it before - is it 100% guaranteed to make you hide when activated, or does it do a skill check with your hide &amp; move silently skills? Similarly, is there any way for it to be spotted (like greater sanctuary)?
