Hey Ghost, welcome to the guild! A couple things:<br><br>1) Nice to see a pure classed build. They're mighty rare. And it's also nice to see a Druid build that's not focussed on grabbing Shifter and/or Monk levels, nor focussed on Dragon Form (although it's a nice plus).<br><br>2) I'm not at all familiar with Druids (never played one), but this looks pretty solid to me. You'll have a nice, strong animal companion to help you out, and you should be able to summon some pretty decent help as well.<br><br>3) Does the Druid have a lot of useful Conjuration spells (i.e. is the Spell Focus in Conj really worth the feats)?<br><br>4) If you're playing in an environment where you get Haste easily, you've got some flexibity in feats, as you can drop the Quicken line - any thoughts on what you'd replace them with?<br><br>The obvious suggestion is going to be to take at least 1 Monk level for the AC bonus (but not by me), but it looks cool; I like the idea of a pure class.<br>_________________<br>Captain's Log, Stardate 6051: had trouble sleeping last night... my hiatal hernia is acting up.

I would say the AOE spell Stonehold is enough alone to justify the focus in conjuration though it does boost Storm of Vengeance as well.  Between those two spells, you have a high chance of paralyze/stun/damage in a very large area.<br><br>For me, I would replace the quicken line with a Hellball and maybe a greater ruin.  Epic spells are fun and you have lots of feats to play with.<br><br>Would also throw in extend spell for extra buf***e while on those long Dragon Shape outing.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/" target="_blank">http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Talamier on 01/22/06 21:58</span></i></p>

Been on this guild since ages but hardly bothered to post much actually <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>But for your questions:<br><br>1) I just want to play non cheese builds most of the time and currently am trying the iconic range of builds especially since there are very few listed.<br><br>2) The animal companion should be quite strong if you buff it up especially with spell resistance and owls insight (makes your summon nearly immune to fear auras)<br><br>3) Stonehold, Storm of Vengeance, Bombardment are a few nice conjuration spells. Add to that, grease is too so if you grease/stonehold an area and then drop a few creeping dooms or SoV in there... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>4) AutoQuicken can be replaced by 2 more Great Wisdom feats so you get your max DC and possibly extend spell. Alternatively you can pick up combat casting and improved combat casting + Great Wisdom and take that again instead of dragon shape at 40th. Quite a few options there.<br><br>Thanks for the comments, keep them coming <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while

AutoQuicken still has an effect when hasted and that is no AoOs when casting.<br><br>As noted in the first post, I left it open whether to choose ESF: Evocation or Dragon Shape there.

Evocation is perfectly fine, most Druid spells are Evocation, in fact Druid's strongest damage dealing spell, Fire Storm, is Evocation.

Truth be told, raising INT wouldn't be so useful being a pure build, not multiclassing has a very wide variety of limitations, sure there are lots of good skills out there to take, but none of them are class skill. You could raise more Discipline but you would cap at 21, you could take Spot or Listen but the same would happen. STR is pretty useless IMO, you can buff it or shift, unless you plan on carrying 10 fullplates with you all the time and still play caster-type unshifted, you really need no more than 10. DEX could stay for the AC, my suggestion was to drop 2 DEX and 2 STR (I say STR is useless, but 8 is actually a bit annoying) to raise INT to 14, but the difference wouldn't be truly significant without a multiclass to skilldump, sorry for the confusion, I just forgot this was a pure build, normally any build improves with more skills.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 06/08/09 00:00</span></i></p>

Raising INT is still a sound strategy for a single class Druid and in this case I think it does improve the original build. <br><br>Two other skills worth considering as a result of higher INT are cross-classed Hide and Move Silently. You'll never be as good a sneak as a Rogue etc, but with the Druid spells Camouflage (+10 Hide), Mass Camoflage (+10 Hide) and One With the Land (+4 Hide &amp; Move Silently) all stacking you can still get it halfway decent - high enough to sneak around a bit to see what you may face down the road. Depending on environment. <br><br>I'd probably take points from Heal if needed to do just that.   <br><br>There is also a third strategy of a single class Druid that comes into play (after fighting shifted and casting spells as indicated above) - calling your summons. <br><br>Never underestimate the power in letting others do the dirty work for you. With the familiar, empathed animals, and one of the best summons in the game via the Elemental Swarm spell (4 summons for the price of one) a druid should always be able to, at the very least, flee from overwhelming odds while his or her pets sacrifice themselves to allow it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">

Probably the outdoor AB bonus druids get.
