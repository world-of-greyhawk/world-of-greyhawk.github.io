Okay, okay, I admit it. I've got Halfling slinger on the brain. <br><br>And after a good 11 or 12 minutes of forethought, <i>The Ghost Slinger</i> is what I came up with.

If you can live with postponing SD into epic, I'd go with Rogue 23 / SD 2 / Bard 15. Doesn't loose you any important feats (well, the shadow-* ones), but gains a few skill points and 2d6 more sneak attack.

Dont know if its possible, but I would go to 20 bard for lasting inspiration.

I would kinda suggest moving point blank shot up, maybe even up ahead of sling focus, if you aren't taking finesse for melee capability.<br><br>Rogue level 20 doesn't benefit you anything in this build... I'd do rogue 19/bard 16 for the improved bardsong and bard spells.<br><br>I think the SD 5 route is a good one, actually, under these conditions.  At most you could squeeze another 1d6 sneak attack out of the build by doing 23 rogue/1 SD/16 bard - but I don't think that would make a very noticeable difference to your damage output and it would delay epic dodge a bunch.<br><br>I'd try to take curse song earlier.<br><br>These sneaky halfling slingers are nice characters, though.  Big cans of whoopass in small packages.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

In general, my preference is for my Rogue/SD builds to have at least 4 levels of SD by 20.<br><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; by tanassi<br>Dont know if its possible, but I would go to 20 bard for lasting inspiration.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->That's easily a workable alternative, but my intention was for a Sneak Attack-based Rogue slinger, with more emphasis on Rogue levels, and having Bard spells and Song as bonus attributes to the character.<br><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; by Xylophone<br>I would kinda suggest moving point blank shot up, maybe even up ahead of sling focus, if you aren't taking finesse for melee capability.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->That's a really good point.

Honestly I don't think there's any one 'Best' level distribution between Bard and Rogue here. There are lots of options, dependent on what Bard Song you want, and what  Sneak Attack you want.

Could take pre-epic in place of Finesse or Toughness. Or early in the 20's.<br><br><br>Some might ask why not take Epic Dodge earlier. Well, I considered that, but didn't want to burn a lot of feats on Great Dex to qualify sooner. With HIPS and Defensive Roll this guy should do okay. And since he's not a toe-to-toe combatant, Epic Dodge isn't as critical for him.<br><br>Thanks for the feedback.

Looks good to me, Kal.  I think someone mentioned the Rogue19/Bard16 vs Rogue20/Bard15 change.  I concur.
