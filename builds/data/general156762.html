After playing a lot online in persistent worlds, I've seen the diversity of builds out there... and it made me realize how badly I have (so far) fared in my campaigns. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br>So... Can you guys recommend a small selection of builds that will work for the NWN single-player campaigns?<br><br>Both for NWN, SotU and HoU please? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Rogue 17/Cleric 15/Fighter 8.  You can go either Str or Dex based.  For a good Str-based version, check out Mithdradates Harbinger of Chaos build; for a good Dex version, check out my Infernal Fencer build.    <br><br>The nice thing about this build is that it's extremely versatile.  It can set traps, cast spells, heal allies, and dish out a good amount of damage in melee.  It also matures fairly quickly.  There are no prestige classes, so you don't have to worry about meeting pre-reqs, although you do have to be a little careful not to get an XP penalty (you have to go Dwarven to avoid an XP penalty; take Rogue as your last level).  <br><br>If you go Str-based you can get Dev. Crit., and if you go Dex-based you can get Epic Dodge.  Throw in Improved Invis. for the 50% concealment and a lot of characters will have trouble hitting you.  Wield a Scimitar and Shield (Rapier and Shield if Dex-based) for a good threat range and decent AC, or a Greatsword for a nice base damage.  Personally I prefer the Scimitar; a 45% percent threat range with Dev. Crit. is just nasty.
