Nice build.  When I pump up strength I normally go with a 2-handed weapon to take advantage of the Str*1.5 damage.<br><br>Lingering song doesn't seem all that great a feat to me.  5 extra rounds of music...

Start with 14 cha and 1 less str, gets you an extra feat.

I would start with Dex at 10 and Cha at 14, gains you 2 feats (a Cat's Grace will guarantee you at least 12 buffed, which is enough with heavy armor). You might want to consider using them for more Str (+1 AB and Damage), or maybe for an ESF: Taunt so you can effectively taunt spellcasters with maxed conc.<br><br>TM

I agree with Separ on the Starting Stats, he makes a good call there.<br><br>Tattoed Monk has some good points as well.<br><br>As for me... here you go:<br><br>Curse Song - I would try to take this earlier in the build, as the cumulative effects of Bard and Curse Song in battle are considerable.<br><br>Extra Music - no need as you take 20 Bard levels - you don't need another 4 uses/ day of Bard/ Curse Song/<br><br>Extend Spell - can not take at 1st level as a Bard - as you need access to level 1 spells.<br><br>Weapon Prof Exotic - ok its nice for style to take a Dwarven Waraxe, but you ain't a dwarf! You could take something else, thus freeing a feat.<br><br>With Bard/ RDD builds its a little conundrum really, which do you want accessible first? the massive stat boost from RDD, AC bonus, Fire &amp; Paralysis Immunity? OR the benefits of Bard Spells and Lasting Inspiration earlier (Earliest able to take it is 24th level). Its personal choice at the end of the day, but getting it earlier would mean you could free a feat from taking Lingering Song (freeing another feat). <br><br>Taking more Bard levels pre-epic will give you a better Reflex save, but at the cost of a reduced Fort Save. The impact is not huge and does mean that all saves are more in line with one another. <br><br>Still Spell - you have 20 caster levels, but you can't cast Ice Storms in melee, nor do you have any ranks in Concentration to allow you to do this.<br><br>Just some thoughts for you. Personally I would reduce Fighter levels to 6, and possibly consider CoT instead, do a search and see what comes up on both types for comparisons. <br><br>More Bard levels could help the build (access to Epic Bard Spells after 23 Bard Levels (and every 3 thereafter) and Bard Song continues to improve up to 20th level after all) - Perhaps a higher CHA value could help also if you go down this road.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 02/15/06 15:07</span></i></p>

My driving force behind this build is to have a good bard with song and spells as early as possible.  I wanted to fit the rest of the RDD levels after level 16 song.  According to the nwnwiki, If I can get 75 perform at lvl 25 bard it will boost the song AC to 6.  I have an extra feat - can one take ESF-Perform twice?  I have never tried...<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/" target="_blank">http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Talamier on 02/15/06 23:09</span></i></p>
