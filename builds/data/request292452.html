Monk/Fighter <br>Human<br>Spear or Dire Mace or Quarterstaff (?) Which is most potent?<br>Max discipline, spell craft, etc...<br><br><br>I ask for spell resistant, without class specification(if a third is needed), becuase I do not know the best way to do this.  I am sure that I max spellcraft...but this character will not cast many spells himself.  Beyond that, what do the weapons require...ie finesse (spear?), two handed fighting and such-ambi, improved Two...?  Could I double a small dagger with any of the afore mentioned weapons?  <br>I think this post is better than my first.  I hope it offers more for you guys to work with.

You don't need Spellcraft for Spell Resistance. What you need are lots of Monk levels. Spellcraft will give you a boost to your saves vs spells though.<br><br>None of the weapons you chose can be finessed.<br><br>Spear and Quarterstaff = two-handed weapon, so best if you go STR based.<br><br>Dire Mace = double weapon, so you need Ambidexterity and Two Weapon Fighting to get the minimum penalty. Imp TWF is a good idea for the extra attack. STR-based is also the best idea for this weapon as well.<br><br>All of these weapons require both hands, so you cannot dual wield with a dagger, although you could opt for dagger as an alternative weapon.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Monks get SR by an amount of 10 + Monk level from level 11 or so I think, so if you want a spell resistant I guess you're taking about 30 Monk levels, by which you should take unarmed or kama.<br><br>Even if you're not taking a heavy Monk for the SR route (doesn't seems like the case) take kama anyway, that way you get +2 APR and Flurry of Blows.<br><br>Kama is finessable by the way.<br><br>I'd probably make a Fighter 34 / Fighter 6 or something like that, but definitely wearing kamas <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

I am still trying to understand the ins and outs of splits and combinations.  I suppose it's all based on what is inherant per class selection and it's level.  So Monk comes with some adavntages right off, as does cleric.  Level 9 or so Ranger gets two-handed weapon for free...so you just map out your plan with these variables in mind and hope.  There are some penalties however, and that is where I think I get lost.  Also. the starting attributes still bug me.  What kind of penalty does one recieve for having a low charisma, or wisdom?  Do I give up points if I make a Conan toon with low int?  Anyway, I am sure this belongs on another thread.  Thanks guys!<br>_________________<br>Calling out to the little known class of Bard-barians.  Your brute creativity has been acknowledged!  Stand and yelp, for it is time to unite.

So I'm looking at a monk 20/fighter9/rogue 11 split.  It seems to offer great spell resistance and some stealth bonuses, which I think stack, or atleast make a top notch stealth/tactical striker.  My notes, manual, don't go into levels beyond 20, so I don't know whats available there.  And I haven't looked at epic models in depth yet...so if you notice any overkill or "whats the point" type stuff, please so.  The answer will be...um, I don't know.  Probably didn't know better.<br><br>Max: discipline, hide, move silently, <br><br>best I can with: lore, perform (if applicable), intimidate, appraisal, open, concentration<br>_________________<br>Calling out to the little known class of Bard-barians.

What does it mean? It's your character's attempt to perform that specific action. The final value is compared against a certain Difficulty Class and if it meets or exceeds the DC, then your character is successful in the attempt.<br><br>As an example, let's assume you have a character that wants to disarm a trap. He has 8 ranks in Disable Device and 14 INT for a +2 modifier, so his total Disable Device skill score is 10 (8 + 2). The trap has a Difficulty Class of 25 to disarm it. When your character tries to disarm the trap, the game 'rolls' a twenty-sided die (the 1d20) and adds the result to your character's skill rank + modifier. In this case a number between 1 and 20 is generated and the result is added to 10 (your skill rank + modifier). If the result is 25 or higher, your character succeeds at disarming the trap. So he must roll a 15 or better on the d20 in order to succeed.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;  I guess I'm just getting into D&amp;D stuff now.

Sometimes you can predict a DC if you recognize your opponent, for example, if you see a player in dragon shift (very noticeable I believe), you can expect a high Stunning Fist DC from him, since Wisdom increases its DC and all dragons must have at least 30 Wisdom, you know his DC is already boosted by +10, if he's a high level Druid (which is highly probable too) he can also buff WIS and his boost can get up to +16 (supposing he has 30 WIS, he could have more).

Thaxll'ssyllia,<br><br>I will take note of your build and use it, I assure you.  However, for this guy it's a diffrent weapon.  I have wanted to try a kama weilding monk, but wanted to understand why the build makes sense before using it.  I do thank you and will follow your guide with another character...perhaps on a server that presents more challenges, or different challenges than my current favorite does.<br>_________________<br>Calling out to the little known class of Bard-barians.  Your brute creativity has been acknowledged!  Stand and yelp, for it is time to unite.
