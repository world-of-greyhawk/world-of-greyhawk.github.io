<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM</b><br><br>In response to Zelle's shifter build, which is optimised for level 40 play, I decided to post a rough template of a Shifter that's actually easy to level on a PW. My current PW is low-magic, the kind of place Shifters thrive, and builds like these are very popular.<br><br>Unlike most builds posted here, this one is made first and foremost to be as easy to level up as possible. It's not as effective at level 40 as Zelle's build, but on most PWs you'd never be able to get Zelle's build to level 40 without some serious twinking.<br><br>Pros<br>- Great AC - for party play, this is a fantastic tank<br>- Gets all Shifter shapes<br>- Decent HP<br>- Decent saves<br><br>Cons<br>- Low AB, especially with Expertise / Improved Expertise<br>- Doesn't get decent Druid spells until right near the end of its levelling life<br>- Won't do as well in high magic environments<br><br>Here's the levelling guide. I haven't included skill points, since the build gets an absolute ton of them, enough to max out the important skills (tumble, discipline) on each of the Monk levels.<br><br>Human<br>Str 12<br>Dex 10<br>Con 14<br>Int 13<br>Wis 17<br>Cha 8<br><br>1 - druid - toughness, luck of heroes<br>2 - druid<br>3 - druid - alertness<br>4 - druid - wis 18<br>5 - druid 5<br>6 - shifter 1 - expertise<br>7 - monk 1 - tumble goes to 10<br>8 - druid 5 / monk 1 / shifter 2 - wis 19<br>9 - shifter 3 - knockdown<br>10 - shifter 4<br>11 - shifter 5<br>12 - shifter 6 - wis 20, improved knockdown<br>13 - shifter 7 - kobold form, whipmaster form<br>14 - monk 2<br>15 - druid 6 - improved expertise<br>16 - druid 7 - wis 21<br>17 - monk 3<br>18 - druid 8 - something<br>19 - shifter 8<br>20 - monk 4 - wis 22<br><br>I went for Druid 8 / Shifter 8 / Monk 4 pre-epic since that gives the best AB and saves. Unfortunately it does mean waiting until level 24 to get the all important Risen Lord shape, but getting it on level 21 would mean dropping the AB and saves. The build already has quite a poor AB compared to pure melee builds, so I didn't want to drop it any further.<br><br>21 - shifter 9 - great wis 1 (23)<br>22 - shifter 10<br>23 - shifter 11<br>24 - shifter 12 - wis 24, undead shape<br>25 - shifter 13 - great wis 2 (25)<br>26 - shifter 14<br>27 - shifter 15 - outsider shape<br>28 - shifter 16 - wis 26, great wis 3 (27)<br>29 - monk 5<br>30 - shifter 17 - construct shape<br>31 - druid 9<br>32 - druid 10 - wis 28<br>33 - druid 11 - great wis 4 (29)<br>34 - druid 12<br>35 - druid 13<br>36 - druid 14 - wis 30, dragon shape<br>37 - druid 15<br>38 - druid 16<br>39 - druid 17 - great wis 5 (31)<br>40 - monk 6 - wis 32<br><br>Final Stats<br>Str 12<br>Dex 10<br>Con 14<br>Int 13<br>Wis 32<br>Cha 8<br><br>In epic levels I went for the shifter shapes rather than the druid spells first, since it'll be easier to survive with Risen Lord and Rakshasa shapes being obtained as soon as possible. I wasn't too bothered about Druid spells until later on, when Creeping Doom became more and more important. The DC on the druid spells is OK, due to the high Wisdom, but with no spell focus feats and a lack of caster levels, the build will always be a better shifter than a caster.<br><br>I would post the AB and AC but my NWN doesn't want to work at the moment, so I can't load the build up. But it does provide a decent template for anyone wanting to level up a Shifter on a PW, who wants to have powerful abilities all the way through the levelling life, rather than just level 40.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 11/04/05 22:49</span></i></p>

Why would you take KD &amp; IKD if you get them for free at monk level 6?

Knockdown is good for playabilities sake but IKD is a tad over the top since most of your shapes are big and fat <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-DaMouse

Or you could go Druid 15/ Monk 8/ Shifter 17 and get it early in epic but lose 9th level Druid spells and free those feats. I know Xylo likes Elemental Swarm but overall, the 9th level Druid spells aren't that good and you get them very very late. I wouldn't want to lose Premonition which you get at 8th level spells, though. BTW, what does Shifter 17 actually give you?<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

Yep, never actually played a shifter thru to 40 (well, i did my dru/shf/cot.. got him to 24 or so, but that was on a slow lvling medium magic world where the itms outstriped any shifter benefits, so i got bored).  But to answer the question, shifter 17 gives you Epic humanoid form, unlimited times per day.  Basically, on a low magic world, it gives you access to +6 weapons <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     which on a low magic world is the cat's meow.   <br><br>And to answer the question above, its druid (no question mark).  In order to get access to shifter you need 5 druid lvls.  <br>Peace<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 11/04/05 04:23</span></i></p>
