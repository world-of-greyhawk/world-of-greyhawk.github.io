<i>One foot in life...and one in the grave, and to bathe in the blood of his enemies his only constant.....</i> <br><br>Time once again for the guilty pleasure build.  While not original in any way, he may be the best in his class.  Forsooth, who here hasn’t wished to have a character with 40 AC in just regular Armor, swinging a Great Axe that delivers Devastating Crits with 4 attacks per round, every Epic Spell you could dream of and more, Immunities to criticals, Stuns and Paralysis, and the ability to summon liches, lich lords, and Epic Mummy Lords wielding +5 Katanas of Nastiness, while still retaining skills like Tumble, UMD, Taunt, Improved Knockdowns and the notorious Improved Disarm to give one that extra edge to situational AB?

What I wanted was a comprehensive, full-packaged Graveyard Champion, someone who was going to destroy everything and everyone, and have a variety of ways to get it done.  Someone who, by Level 31, had Dev Crit, Crit Immunity, EWS and Epic Warding.  Basically, I wanted someone who sold their soul for powers beyond the pale.  Heh….  So, I had 3 goals when designing this build:  4 attacks per round, the maximum allowable PM levels, and Epic Warding taken the earliest possible moment that the feat can be taken (34 Spellcraft being the target).  I succeeded, and having playtested this guy on a mid-magic PW, he is a battle machine.<br><br>A note about weapons:  This is a build that really should take advantage of 2-handed weapons.  Feel free to choose from among the lot.  Halberd was chosen because it deals 2 damage types and is x3 crit multiplier.  While it doesn’t crit as often as a greatsword, it has added versatility with damage types, looks really cool, and the bad guys have a harder time recovering from those x3 crits than they do the x2.  <br><br>Finally, some might ask, "why not go for PM25 so that you can get the extra feat?"  To answer, that's the only thing one would get.  Another feat.  The improved Summons and AC was secured at 24th level, and since he already has every epic spell but 1, I found the Bard's ability to cap out Tumble, UMD, Spellcraft and Taunt a much more lucrative investment.<br><br><b>Combat Guide</b><br>There's really no strategy here.  This is a straight-up mauler.  High AC and immunities allow him to outlast his opponents, and his heavy hitting Halberd insure that he takes his opponents out.  Dev Crit will allow him to wade easily through the mobs, and his beard will insure you look good doing it.  Not that he really needs them, but the built-in Undead Army, Epic Warding, Epic Mage Armor and Greater Ruin allow him to take on even the toughest opponents a module has to offer.  UMD will allow him to self-buff via scrolls or wands if needed.<br><br>Also, the Charnel Lord enjoys the luxury of several activated combat feats (Power Attack, Improved Disarm, Improved Knockdown).  One could make a true AC monster by dropping either the IKD line or the Disarm and acquiring Expertise/Improved Expertise.  With this in hand, one can gain a 70 AC without even using items (40 base+20EMA+10Improved Expertise).<br><br>Cheers!<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 05/27/10 21:06</span></i></p>

WoW!  <br><br>Just one thing i was wondering, as i have never really looked at PM's in any depth.  For the epic spells, is the duration and such based on Bard or PM lvl?

Seriously avado, you can't deny you stalk grizz's builds, admit it now and nobody will misjudge you, honest.<br><br>The build looks pretty nice, it looks very enjoyable in high levels, once you get the epic spells and dev crit (there's nothing wrong with pre-epic, but the build won't shine as a Pale Master at low levels, just a regular Fighter). Any builder to choose Halberd as its weapon is on my good side, cheers grizz.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 05/09/08 07:26 (GMT) -- avado<br><br>THax, you know i love and respect you, right?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Well, I think any low to mid magic should be fairly solid.  Granted Dev Crit is in the build, so you would need to drop about 3 feats if the world has Dev crit banned.

This pushes back the Tumble skill dump to allow for a UMD skill Bump at Level 14.

Wow Grizz and I was impressed with your Myrmidon Eternal build. I'd say you improved on it in alot of ways. This guy is got the spookiness that could suggest he is a dwarven warlord of the ages, stalking the world in search of his past glories in his former life.<br><br>Your other build is a bit higher in the AB department, but this guy has more special abilities and more epic spells.<br><br>One thing I noticed, you must have changed your mind on weapons, as you start off talking about a great axe and then use a halberd in your build. An improvement I'd say anyhow as you now have two damage sources and an element of halberd style.<br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Nestrial Darkfalcon on 11/16/08 21:32</span></i></p>

Good points Grim *grin*<br><br>Halberds do have some style and they are a solid weapon. I'm not saying anything about replacing the good old trusty great axe completely. Halberd style is something I believe is simply the fact that you don't see them often. Also, eventhough game mechanics probably don't reflect this; I believe in logical terms a dwarf with a halberd would reach further than one with a great axe... <br><br>*poke* <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.

Hey scooter.  What i would do is keep pwr att and cleave (since you already have them).  Drop gr cleave, overwhelm and dev crit.  In place of over and dev crit, i would take 2 gr str for a str of 32.  That is +1 damage, +1 ab.   You still have an open pre-epic feat for one of your save feats or something like that.

Considering the name of the build and the fact that folk are still talking about it I don't feel guilty about Necroing this one.

Then go with Scythe.  This plus all the other builds by you and Cinnabar Din that I have on The North are a ton of fun.  Though this will be my first time trying a PM of any race.

They're referring to using the spell Tenser's Transformation which, by default, changes your race to elf and leveling up as an AA while the spell is active as a result.

I made a DwD/Wizard(i think)/AA on a persistent world and it worked.. I don't know if it works in all cases but it worked on the world I was playing on.

I have at least three of your builds wreaking havoc on my favorite PW and Two of Cinnabar Din's.  Sparked me to do my own Dwarf build.  After I finished it and got it on the North, I did a check on Pulse Caps search engine.  I found that somebody did a build so similar (same classes, same levels of classes. but some different feats and skills) that I hesitate to put it on the board.  Anyway, with you still coming up with builds, who needs to see my attempts.  Sort of like an Art student trying to out do Rembrant, or DaVinci.

This is a favorite of mine too.  That said, what I find amusing is that there's an alternate design posted (with a yet better name), that goes PM20.  The one I play splits the difference, at PM22.  Still, it's a lovely build.  Just the sort of elegance I expect from a Dwarflord build.
