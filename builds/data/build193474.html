<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>I wanted to make a bard/rdd/bg and read the many topics dealing with that build. I've found a lot of interesting things, and obviously, this template was inspired by all those previous builds, as the bard/rdd/bg build is a classical one. I think this version is quite polished, but most important, it's easily playable. Feel free to comment &amp; improve it.<br>Anyway, here is how I would imagine that bard who would bring death and sorrow to his opponents :<br><br><br>Race: Human<br>--------------------------<br>     FINAL BUILD <br>--------------------------<br><br>CLASSES:<br> - Bard (20)<br> - Red Dragon Disciple (16)<br> - Black Guard (4)<br><br>ABILITIES:<br>  Str: 26<br>  Dex: 08<br>  Con: 14<br>  Int: 16<br>  Wis: 08<br>  Cha: 26<br><br>STATISTICS:<br>  Hit Points: 321<br>  AC: 35<br>  Will Save: 30<br>  Fort.

cool build.  I'm always fond of divine might/shield builds.<br><br>bard 26/rdd 10/bg 4 gets one more bonus feat and a better bard song.  rdd 15 gives +1 ac, but so does 25 bard if you've got the perform skill high enough.  fewer hitpoints though.<br><br>The extra feat could go towards great cha, so you can lower your starting cha to 15 and you'll get two more extra starting stat points to spend (+2 con would work nicely to make up for the lost hps).<br><br>Alternatively you could grab blind-fight and keep the existing stat spread.  I hate trying to beat down invis or concealed guys without blind-fight.<br><br>going 26 bard instead of rdd also allows you to get lasting impression at lvl 36 instead of 39, which could make leveling easier.

The problem I had was to find a way to obtain 80 in perform skill if i chose to go bard26, and i must admit, i didnt find it ( unless perhaps sacrificing all the free feats to get epic perform skill )

Good point.  It really depends on equipment, since that is the only way to reach epic bardsong perform levels.  <br><br>If you can max your cha and if you take 43 points in perform you can get to 57, which is a lvl 21 bard song.  You don't get that +1 ac, but you get +30 temporary hps and +9 skills.  You also get 6 more curse songs to use before resting.<br><br>With a +30 perform item (epic minstrel gloves) you'd exceed the 80 perform needed for a lvl 26 bardsong.  If the right equipment is available you won't need any skill focus (perform) feats.
