Hi Guys well this first build Idea <br><br>Well here it is <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>In my xperiences most barb builds lack alot of feats and they dont do many crits so many people usually go for the <br>12fighter/3rogue(tmble class25dd if they wanted high hp high ac(allround nice char)<br><br>But I like Barbarian and think its under rated sometimes so i though sumthing like going 10barb 7wm 13barb then lastly 10fighter (to get fighting feats) so theres the skeleton of the build if u great char builds could spend alittle bit of time to bring it altogether that would be real nice well i'll leave it too u <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br><br>Damien<br>------------------<br>You Cannot Kill That Which Is Already Dead <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> <br>A Story About The Genius Brother Of Mine Who Talked About <br>A Fart For 23hrs <br>*breaks wind*  (little brother only 4 but knows star trek instead out)<br>was a nuclear warhead hitting us but being stopped by our force field,which if u didnt know is used by using a gravitizer and a chemical called hydro Chlorine Ethuminal<br>Blah Blah blah (by this time i in bed and he still explaining) the So am I right?

Try this out.<br><br>Make a Barbarian who can get ALL the Barbarian class feats and Devestating Critical by 40th which will require a 25 Strength and 21 Con (for other Epic Barbarian skills). <br><br>It's pretty hard but have found that it's possible if you go with 40 levels of Barbarian - OR - Barbarian/Bard/RDD (which also opens up Tumbling and Use Items for your build).<br><br>-G
