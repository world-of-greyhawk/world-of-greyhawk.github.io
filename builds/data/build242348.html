Ode to a Lily<br>Bard 26, Fighter 4, Champion of Torm 10<br>Human<br>Female - Lily Evermore (Hence the name)<br>Chaotic Neutral (to avoid smites &amp; would seem to be the best alignment to fit a Bard)<br>PvM 1-40 (more than likely could do well in PvP, but I have not tested in that environment)<br><br>Currently using this build in a PW with some very pleasing results. The lack of Bard levels pre-epic is made up by the UMD ability, particularly with GMW and other weapon type buffs (Flame Weapon, etc). <br><br>The Scribe Scroll feat was selected at 8th level, inspired by Grizz in his recent <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "241764", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Harper Galloglas</a> build. This has thrown up something, which I had not been aware of before, and I am not certain whether it is unique to  the PW I am using this on or not. <br><br>Anyway, you can scribe the spell Greater Magic Weapon when you take your 8th Bard level (12th in the build), but when casting it from the scroll, you get a continual value of a +5 enhancement to the melee weapon it is cast on. I had assumed this would follow the same path as the spell progression, being based on caster level, but it appears not to, which is nice. <br><br>Two other builds out there have the same class types taken:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "216596", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Swordmaiden of Torm /Fighter 8/Bard 8/CoT 24</a><br> --Kaliban99<br><br>A very different build - focusing in two weapon types (1 ranged and 1 melee), with a much heavier bent on CoT rather than Bard.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "217645", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Veteran Party-Leader /Fighter 6/Bard 24/COT 10</a><br> --Xylophone<br><br>Similar to Xylo's in the sense this is STR based as well. Will Save is higher, with a higher base damage output, Bard levels taken to 26 as opposed to 24 giving the next step up in Bard/ Curse Song with +6 AC bonus; a focus in developing 3 skills to a high unbuffed level: Discipline, Perform and Taunt; Lasting Inspiration is taken 6 levels earlier.

Well done, I like it. Maybe the fact my daughter's name (the short version of it actually) is Lili has got something to do with it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>What about Artist and SF: Perform instead of Luck of Heroes and Iron Will?

As of this time, we still aren't certain how it was calculating caster level, but it was certainly beyond the actual caster levels in the character.

Glad you like it Kail, hope your daughter does too!<br><br>The question with Artist and SF: Perform is that it will only grant you +5 to Perform in total, taking the base value to 61. <br><br>This is still 19 points from the required 80 ranks needed to activate a 26th level Bard Song. To be honest, the only way you are going to achieve this is through a mixture of a capped Charisma and item/s with a Perform bonus.<br><br>If you are dependent on that anyway, then you may as well rely on it for the further 5 points from the two feats mentioned above.<br><br>However, items with Perform enhancements may be at a premium, so the choice ultimately is yours. If you do sacrifice the two, then your base saves reduce as follows:<br><br>F 29 (-1)<br>W 28 (-3)<br>R 27 (-1)<br><br>Personally, if I was to remove them, then i would be more inclined to replace them with both Power Attack and Cleave to increase your melee effectiveness. Personal choice at the end of the day.<br><br>That's interesting to know Grizz, the PW I am on is at patch 1.67 and CEP 1.53, so I think I will have to investigate further. <br><br>I don't think it is across the board of the entire scroll listing, as casting a darkfire scroll does not max the value on the weapon.

I like this. Your biggest problem is probably AB ... but you can potentially get a 26th level bard song with lasting inspiration, so who cares?<br>_________________<br>CATS!

Of course you can also improve your AB through the effects of both Curse Song (-6AC) and Taunt (which will very rarely be resisted against).<br><br>"Taunt DC (unbuffed 56, bard song &amp; capped CHA 77)"<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 06/01/06 08:50</span></i></p>
