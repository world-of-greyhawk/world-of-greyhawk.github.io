<b>Playable from level 1-40... PVM or PVP</b><br><br>Aynvund threw himself over the shattered remains of a once finely sculpted fluted column, narrowly avoiding a flurry of Drow darts.  His stout Dwarven legs could have accepted his weight with ease, but he fell back his back against the root of the column to catch his breath.   With a deft motion, he severed the leather straps binding his sundered shield to his arm with his notched axe.  He let his axe fall with the shield, his attention more focused on his battered shield arm than the battle around him.  The same strike that had ruined his shield had also cleaved through his bracer, driving the metal into the spurting wound.  He could not move or feel his hand and he feared that, even if he should survive, the healers could not save the limb.  Still, he could not relent, if he bandaged the limb and drank the last of the potions the clerics had given him he might still be of some use to his unit.  Moradin knew they needed every soul that could swing an axe to step forward.<br><br>At first they thought it was another Drow raid.  The Dwarves had dug deep in their quest for Mithral, deep enough to touch the Underdark.  Initially they had taken several casualities from Drow raiding parties, but with time they had adapted their tactics to drive off the parties with minimal losses.  They built up the earth by the entrance to the Underdark so that any invading force would have to fight uphill and constructed a great parapet two dwarves deep from where the defenders could keep the Drow at bay.  When the Drow had attacked this day they thought it was just another raiding party, it was somewhat larger than the others about fifty warriors.  In retrospect there was a shadow that seemed to shroud them, but it had not seemed important at that time.  The guardsmen sent runners into the keep to rally troops, while they took up position with crossbows on the parapet to meet the Drow charge.  As the guardsmen notched their bows with light ensorcelled bolts, and awaited their enemies, they did not notice the darkness rushing past the Drow to envelop the parapet.  <br><br>Suddenly the guardsmen found themselves enveloped in darkness.  At first they were calm, they had expected this considering their opponents, and they clutched the medallions about their neck tracing the runes which would push back the darkness with glorious light.  All the medallions did, however, was cast a pale glow that did little more than illuminate the now fear-stricken faces of the defenders. They groped about in the dark, casting aside their crossbows for axes and called out for each other to try and organise their scattered line into a defensive formation.  With a scream the first defender died, torn in two by a force from the shadows.  One by one the defenders had met similar fates.  The Drow had taken the parapet without a single casualty.<br><br>Without any organized resistance, the Drow made quick progress through the lower levels of the keep, slaughtering any they could find, until they had reached the gallery of Dugmaren, where Aynvund’s unit and two others had prepared an ambush.  It was a place of great natural beauty which the Dwarves had enhanced with their considerable masonry skills. The gallery was a large cavern filled with crystalline stalactites which the Dwarves had sculpted into columns and images of the Dwarven god, which caught the light of the torches set in the walls of the gallery and refracted it through the hall.  To add to this effect, the natural floor of the gallery had been levelled and set with obsidian tiles that had been polished to a mirror-like shine.  The whole of this combined to create swirling pattern of multicoloured light and crystal which danced with the flicker of the torches.  It was because of these optical properties that the Dwarves had chosen this place to mount a counter strike, aided by prayers of the clerics, the Gallery could be made as bright as day, and the cacaphony of light would aid in hiding the Dwarven defenders and blind their Drow opponents.  <br><br>It had seemed the perfect position, and at first it was.  The Drow raiding party paused before they entered the Gallery, using their innate magics to block out the light of the resplendent cavern.  The dwarves within the gallery crouched behind columns and sculptures breathlessly following the footfalls of their foes.  As the Drow reached the center of the gallery, the Dwarven clerics negated the darkness and amplified the light of the torches.  In an instant, the silent hall was filled with a rush of light and sound as the blinded drow shrieked in pain and the Dwarves raised their battle cries and charged.  The Dwarves made good use of the surprise, springing on the incapacitated elves, they cut them down like stalks of wheat before the scythe.  <br><br>As Aynvund pulled his axe from the skull of a Drow mage, he noticed the light suddenly dim.  The remaining Drow, a group of seven warriors clustered in ring around a priestess, had managed to put up a wall of shields.  The priestess barked a command that Aynvund did not understand but, as the Drow dropped behind their shields angling them into a dome, Aynvund raised his shield and ducked into a low defensive stance.  He began to bark an order for his men to do the same, but an unearthly scream from the entrance of the gallery drowned out his command.  For an instant there was silence, then a wave of shadow swept through the cavern destroying everything in its path.  The beautiful columns and statues, splintered into razor like shards which cut through the Dwarven ranks.  Aynvund, had managed to weather the attack, his shield and armour had caught the shards but the wave of shadow had chilled him.  It was not ordinary cold, it was deeper and more insidious, it seemed to emanate from within the Dwarven warrior and made his limbs feel leaden.  As the darkness passed, some of the light returned though it was diminished, the nature of this place would not let the light be extinguished by such means.  <br><br>By the dim light, Aynvund could survey the carnage.  The other dwarves had not feared as well as Aynvund.  More than half of the Dwarves were dead including the clerics whose armor had been lighter than the warriors. Among the dozen remaining defenders, not one had escaped the fury of blast.  Most of them had serious wounds from the crystaline shards and others had been so weakened by shadow blast that they could scarcely hold their arms.  Aynvund, could not attend to the wounded, not while enemies were about.  The Drow had weathered the assault unscathed, but they were secondary compared to the source of the shadow blast.   He turned to attention towards the entrance of the Gallery.  A dark form, so large it filled the great cavern, was rushing towards him. Aynvund barely had enough time to raise his shield, before the claw of the shadow dragon smashed into it, catapulting the dwarf across the gallery. <br><br>Crouched behind the broken column, Aynvund could do little but pry the bracer from his arm so that he could apply the bandage.  Tears, flowed down his ruddy cheeks as he heard the screams of Dwarves being killed by the dragon.  They could have defeated the drow, but what chance did they have against a shadow dragon?  He peered around the ruined gallery, seeking some source of hope.  No image of Dugmaren was left unmarred, the crystal shards had smashed the tiled floor.   Even if they managed to gain victory this day he doubted this place would ever be more than a mockery of its former glory.  The hall seemed to grow darker, was it a reflection of his dark thoughts or the blood flowing from his arm?  Aynvund heard a voice speaking strange words he had never heard before, what new horror was this he wondered?  Suddenly there was a flash of light, so brilliant it hurt Aynvund’s eyes, and room shook with an unearthly scream.<br><br>“How dare ye defile this hallowed ground with your vile presence!” bellowed a smooth baritone voice.  It was a voice Aynvund had heard before, the voice of the Pilgrim.  He had travelled far from the south to witness the splendour of this place.  He was a veteran of many battles and he claimed that Dugmaren Brightmantle himself had saved his life on the battlefield, choosing him for a greater purpose.  Since that day he had sworn service to the Errant Explorer.   Though he wore plate armour and carried an axe, they were adorned with runes Aynvund had never seen, others said they were the marks of a mage.  Could this one warrior turn the tide of the battle?  Aynvund peered over the column, looking towards the sounds of battle.<br><br>The Drow were reeling from the blinding light, and the Shadow dragon trashed about, its body wracked with pain.  As he peered at its ebon form he could see darkness oozing from it wounds to form ethereal pools of shadow on the floor.  Still, Aynvund could not see the Pilgrim.  Then, from space between the Drow and the Dragon, he saw a distortion in the air, sparks of energy seemed to fill the space coalescing into a brilliant orb that streaked towards the wounded dragon.  The roar of the beast shook the cavern as the orb exploded into blue bolts that played over its convulsing body.  Aynvund, turned his attention back towards the distortion, it was as if someone had taken reality and wrapped it about themselves as a cloak, but the cloak was too tight and bulged outwards.  He could now see the distortion had the form of an armoured figure, which turned towards the Drow.<br><br>Aided by their Preistess, who had restored their sight, the Drow warriors had regrouped, forming a wall between the figure and their Preistess.  With a coordination that only practiced soldiers could muster they hurled their poisoned darts towards the distortion.  As the darts streaked through the air, there was a flash of light and the distortion vanished.  The darts flew through the space it had occupied, continuing their arc to strike the dragon, which roared again fading into the shadows to mask its presence.   “Ye missed me!” taunted a voice from behind the Drow line.  Turning his attention there, Aynvund saw the distortion standing over the broken bloody corpse of the priestess.<br><br>The Drow rushed the shimmering form, drawing their longswords.  The distortion met the charge of the lead elf head on, it batted aside the longsword and threw itself into the shield of the warrior knocking him into his companions and breaking up the charge. As the warrior stumbled back, the distortion struck out, severing the Drow’s leading leg at the knee.  The distortion pounced on the prostrate form, blood sprayed everywhere as it hewed the elf’s head in two with a mighty overhead swing.  The remaining Drow swung at the figure, but their blades rebounded inches away from the figure, sending up a spray of a viscous sickly yellow-green liquid that hissed and smoked as it fell upon the dark elves, burning their skin and armor.  As the Drow recoiled, the figure struck at two of the retreating forms, who fell struggling in vain to hold in the contents of their ruptured abdomens.<br><br>“I liked ye better blind!” yelled the figure.  Aynvund shielded his eyes with his good arm as another burst of blinding light issued from the figure.  He wished he had also shielded his ears as another bellow issued from the dragon.  Wounded and enraged, another wave of darkness issued forth from its maw, washing over the figure and the helpless elves.  Aynvund’s heart leaped into his throat, but as the darkness past, he saw the figure still upright surrounded by corpses of the Drow warriors.  “I guess ye didn’t care for’em much either!” chortled the figure, as the Dragon faded into the shadows again.<br><br>The figure stood still, as if straining to hear the dragon.  Aynvund strained as well but there was no sound to be heard, save from his beating heart and shallow breath.  Seconds passed like hours, until the figure spun striking out at the darkness which materialized into the form of the Dragon.  The figure swung repeatedly, striking repeatedly at the dragon’s abdomen.  Dark ichor pored from the wounds of the beast.  It struck at the form with its claws but its attacks were turned by the magical wards of warrior-mage and each attack splashed the shadowy form with acid.  Confronted with a foe it could defeat, the dragon faded into the shadows to escape.  It was of no avail, the figure had always seen the Dragon, even when it was hidden.  It thrust its arm into the darkness, barking a few words in the language Aynvund had heard before.  A deluge of white bolts streaked into the shadows twisting and arcing as they smashed into their target.  The shadow dragon crashed to the floor of the gallery, a low hissing gasp escaping from its mouth as it succumbed to it wounds.<br><br>Aynvund sunk back against the column.  With the battle over, the adrenaline and fear that had sustained him departed, and the pain of his wound washed over him like fire.  As his consciousness faded, he laughed secure in the knowledge that the Spellaxe of Dugmaren had saved them all.<br><br>Many people's main complaint about spellswords is that they have a low AB.  This Spellsword, with a 44 AB, doesn't have that problem.  With level 9 spells, a high AB and pretty nasty critical hits he has a really strong offense.  Defensively he is lacking somewhat, he has low hit points, but epic warding makes up for that.  He is vulnerable to other mages, but, with his spell power, mages are vulnerable to him as well.  This build is playable from level 1-40, but in epic levels a lot of skill points have to be saved.  He should do well in a low to mid magic setting where devastating critical is banned. <br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-Good AB.  A 44 AB is on par with most pure fighters and very high for a spellsword.<br>-16-20 threat range on an x4 weapon.  He can do critical hits for over 100 points of damage when buffed, and thanks to the keen edge spell he always has a keen battle axe. <br>-Level 9 wizard spells.  He doesn't have any enchantments and his DCs are low, but there are plenty of spells that don't have DCs.  His caster level is high enough to get past item based SR after casting Mordenkainen's Disjunction.<br>-Epic Warding.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br><br>-Low Hitpoints.  An unfortunate result of the wizard levels, but epic warding extends his viability in combat and globe of invulnerability and spell mantles help against spell damage.<br>-Mediocre saving throws.  His saves vs. spells are fairly good and he has spells that can augment his defenses (mind blank provides immunity to mind spells and shadow shield protects from negative energy and death magic). <br>-Low caster level.  He is at some risk from a greater dispel (20% vulnerable) and a high level mage can hit him with a Mordenkainen's Disjunction, but epic warding and his item buffs can't be dispelled.<br><br><b>Dugmaren's Spellaxe</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Dwarf<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Any<br><br><i>Base Attribute</i><br>STR 17   <br>DEX 13 <br>CON 12 <br>WIS 8<br>INT 16 <br>CHA 6 <br><br><i>Leveling Guide</i><br>Levels 1-6 Fighter<br>Levels 7-10 Weapon Master<br>Levels 11-12 Illusionist<br>Levels 13-15 Weapon Master<br>Level 16-17 Illusionist<br>Levels 18-20 Weapon Master<br>Levels 21-33 Illusionist<br>Level 34 Weapon Master<br>Levels 35-37 Illusionist<br>Level 38 Weapon Master<br>Level 39 Illusionist<br>Level 40 Weapon Master<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Fighter 6<br>Illusionist 21<br>Weapon Master 13<br><br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>All 10 attribute bonuses go to STR<br><br><i>Feats</i><br>Level 1: Dodge, Weapon Focus (Battle Axe) <br>Level 2: Mobility<br>Level 3: Knockdown<br>Level 4: Expertise<br>Level 6: Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack<br>Level 9: Improved Knockdown<br>Level 12: Improved Critical (Battle Axe)<br>Level 15: Still Spell<br>Level 18: Blind-Fight<br>Level 21: Epic Weapon Focus (Battle Axe), Great Intelligence I<br>Level 24: Great Strength I<br>Level 26: Great Intelligence II<br>Level 27: Great Strength II<br>Level 30: Great Strength III<br>Level 31: Great Intelligence III<br>Level 33: Autostill Spell I<br>Level 36: Autostill Spell II<br>Level 37: Autostill Spell III <br>Level 39: Epic Spell:Epic Warding<br>Level 40: Epic Prowess<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 30<br>DEX 13<br>CON 12<br>WIS 8<br>INT 19<br>CHA 6<br><br><i>Final Saves (vs. Spells)</i><br>Fortitude 20 (31) <br>Reflexes 21 (32)<br>Will 18 (29)<br><br><i>AB and Damage</i><br><br>(No buffs, normal Battle Axe)<br>44/39/34/29 10+1D8 (17-20 X4)<br><br>(Bull's Strength, Flame Weapon, True Strike, Greater Magic Weapon, Keen Edge, Haste, Normal Battle Axe)<br>66/61/56/51/66 17+1D8 (1D4+10 fire) (16-20 X4) <br><br>Maximum AB: 70<br><br><i>AC</i> <br>26 (27) (Full Plate, Tower Shield, No Buffs)<br>41 (42) (Mage Armor, Shield, Shadow Shield, Haste, Full Plate, Tower Shield)<br>54 (55) (Full Plate +5, Tower Shield +5, Amulet of Natural Armor +5, Ring of Protection +5, Boots of Hardiness+3, Haste, Mage Armor)<br><br><i>Hit Points</i> 314 (Max Every Level)<br> <br><i>Final Skillpoints</i> 229<br>Concentration 42 (43)<br>Discipline 43 (52) <br>Intimidate 16 (15)<br>Listen 43 (42)<br>Spellcraft 41 (45)<br>Tumble 20 (22)<br><br><br><i>Skillpoint Distribution</i><br>Level 1: Concentration 4, Discipline 4, Intimidate 2, Tumble 2, Save 4<br>Level 2: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Save 7<br>Level 3: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Intimidate 1, Tumble 1, Save 6 <br>Level 4: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Save 9<br>Level 5: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Intimidate 1, Tumble 1, Save 8<br>Level 6: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Save 11<br>Level 7: Discipline 1, Listen 10, Tumble 1, Save 3<br>Level 8: Discipline 1, Listen 1, Save 6<br>Level 9: Discipline 1, Listen 1, Tumble 1, Save 7<br>Level 10: Discipline 1, Listen 1, Save 10<br>Level 11: Concentration 5, Spellcraft 8, Tumble 1<br>Level 12: Concentration 1, Spellcraft 4<br>Level 13: Discipline 3, Tumble 1<br>Level 14: Discipline 1, Listen 4<br>Level 15: Discipline 1, Listen 1, Tumble 1, Save 1<br>Level 16: Concentration 4, Spellcraft 2<br>Level 17: Concentration 1, Spellcraft 2, Tumble 1<br>Level 18: Discipline 3, Listen 2<br>Level 19: Discipline 1, Listen 2, Tumble 1 <br>Level 20: Discipline 1, Listen 1, Save 3<br>Level 21: Concentration 4, Spellcraft 2, Tumble 1<br>Level 22: Concentration 1, Spellcraft 4 <br>Level 23: Concentration 1, Spellcraft 2, Tumble 1<br>Level 24: Concentration 1, Spellcraft 3, Save 1<br>Level 25: Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1, Save 2<br>Level 26: Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 5<br>Level 27: Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1, Save 7<br>Level 28: Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 11<br>Level 29: Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1, Save 13<br>Level 30: Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 17<br>Level 31: Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1, Save 19<br>Level 32: Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 23<br>Level 33: Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1, Save 25<br>Level 34: Discipline 14, Intimidate 3, Listen 14<br>Level 35: Concentration 2, Spellcraft 2, Tumble 1<br>Level 36: Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 4<br>Level 37: Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1, Save 6<br>Level 38: Discipline 4, Intimidate 4, Listen 4<br>Level 39: Concentration 2, Spellcraft 1, Save 3<br>Level 40: Discipline 2, Intimidate 5, Listen 2<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

This appears to be a very strong spellsword, and playable from early levels. Though, I'd say going with a scimitar is better, the axe is way more stylish. You could probably also run with a greataxe instead of a battleaxe if you wanted to drop AC for damage, but I guess wizard buffs give you enough already.<br><br>314 HP is ridiculously low, though.<br>_________________<br>CATS!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avarielo on 05/07/06 23:31</span></i></p>

This build is pretty neat<br>I like the story<br>_________________<br>They were all dead. The final gunshot was an exclamation mark to everything that had led up to this point. I released my finger from the trigger. And then it was all over. The storm seemed to lose its frenzy. The ragged clouds gave way to the stars above.

Wow, Mithradates, thought you were lost in time.<br>Your build seems very powerful, with very nice AB, and full wizards arsenal.<br><br>But I see you use the format from the stone-ages, no offense. Try to set it up like other builds here, much easier to relate to. PM it to Kail, I'm sure he'll help.<br><br>Welcome back. You're almost legendary <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    with most builds of all, I think.<br><br>Another thing. I am no fan of only 7 WM levels, but 13 is almost worse. You spend 6 levels to gain 1 AB and 1 eoic feat. wouldn't it be better to take 6 fighter levels? Or 4 fighter levels to net 1 feat, and 2 wiz levels to reduce the chance of being dispelled and net a wizard feat?<br><br>*edit* Rocking story, goes nicely with the build.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

The scimitar will threaten more often and the axe will inflict more severe criticals.  Because Ki critical adds a flat +2 bonus to your threat range, I prefer giving my WMs higher multiplier weapons (not counting Dev. Crit. builds). Remember, against high AC opponents the bigger threat range doesn't help you if you need a high roll to hit.  In that case you'll get the same number of critcal hits with the Axe and the Scimitar but the Axe will hurt more.  Against lower AC opponents the Scimitar will do more damage (and on a rest restricted server you may want your Spellsword to hack through the cannon fodder, leaving his spellbook full for the big fights). DR will also tend to skew the favor towards the Axe.  That said, it's largely a matter of choice and taste. <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>314 HP is ridiculously low, though.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Not much you can do when your primary class has 1D4 hitpoints.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 05/08/06 08:25</span></i></p>

I am no fan of only 7 WM levels, but 13 is almost worse. You spend 6 levels to gain 1 AB and 1 eoic feat. wouldn't it be better to take 6 fighter levels?

Both of the options you suggested seem very workable and the build could benefit from a couple of extra feats, such as weapon spec. and epic weapon spec., toughness, empower spell, maximize spell or Epic Spell:Epic Mage Armor.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>*edit* Rocking story, goes nicely with the build.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Thanks,  I believe the story trend is another one that I started way, way back with the Lone Ranger build on the General Discussion Epic Character thread.

Nice build, and a great story to go with it, too. Very exciting <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>I'd consider starting with 16 STR/15 CON and change one Great STR to Great CON. That would gain +80 HP and +2 Fortitude saves in exchange for -1 AB/Damage.

Very nice build, getting an AB this high on a spellsword is good work.  I guess in theory you could go with 18 wizard levels and 16 WM levels, as well, for another point of AB and the change of a wizard metamagic bonus feat for a WM epic bonus feat.  And even fewer caster levels.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
