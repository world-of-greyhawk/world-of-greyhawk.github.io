This character build was made with 10 attacks per round combined with the darkfire spell in mind. Played in a mid magic persistant world with no permenent immunuties. Dual kamas were choosen, for max attack per round, and the fact that a monk can't set his hands on fire or give gloves a +5 enchantment. This build did well, for PvM. Haven't tried PvP. I know there are 4 other builds on the build search with the same classes, but 2 with high WM and other 2 with Str build. Insperation from a "man chicken" build, but with darkfire and divine favor replacing damage from high str. Ended up with this build. I am a stranger to level 40 power builds, and I'm sure that this needs a lot of tweaking. Please tell me what you think about this build and how to improve it.<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Lawful Good (or any Lawful)<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 16<br>Con 14<br>Wis 14<br>Int 14<br>Cha 8<br><br><br>Leveling<br><br>1  Monk(1) Dodge, Mobility<br>2  Cleric(1)<br>3  Cleric(2) Weapon Finesse<br>4  Cleric(3) Dex+1(17)<br>5  Cleric(4)<br>6  Cleric(5) Weapon Focus: Kama<br>7  Monk(2)<br>8  Cleric(6) Wis+1(15)<br>9  Cleric(7) Expertise<br>10 Cleric(8)<br>11 Cleric(9)<br>12 Monk(3) Wis+1(16) Spring Attack<br>13 Cleric(10)<br>14 Cleric(11)<br>15 Cleric(12) Whirlwind Attack<br>16 WM(1) DEX+1(18)<br>17 Monk(4)<br>18 WM(2) Ambidexterity<br>19 WM(3)<br>20 WM(4) Wis+1(17)<br><br>21 WM(5) Two Weapon Fighting<br>22 Cleric(13)<br>23 WM(6)<br>24 WM(7) Wis+1(18), Improved Two Weapon Fighting<br>25 Cleric(14)<br>26 Cleric(15)<br>27 Monk(5) Extend Spell<br>28 Cleric(16) WIS+1(19)<br>29 Cleric(17)<br>30 Cleric(18) Epic Weapon Focus: Kama<br>31 Cleric(19)<br>32 Cleric(20) Dex+1(19)<br>33 Cleric(21) Improved Critical: Kama<br>34 Cleric(22)<br>35 Cleric(23) Great Wis (20)<br>36 Cleric(24) Dex+1(20) Blind Fight<br>37 Monk(6)<br>38 Cleric(25)<br>39 Cleric(26) Great DEX I (21) Armor Skin<br>40 Cleric(27) Dex+1(22)<br><br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 22<br>Con 14<br>Wis 20<br>Int 14<br>Cha 8<br><br><br>Skills<br>Concentrate  43 (For casting Harm in combat)<br>Disable Trap  1 (Useful)<br>Disipline    40 (Combat oriented skill)<br>Intimidate    4 (Weapon Master prequisite)<br>Listen       20 (For "seeing through walls")<br>Lore         15 (Used often)<br>Open Lock     1 (Useful)<br>Persuade     20 (RP skill)<br>Spellcraft   43 (Saving throw)<br>Tumble       40 (AC bonus)<br><br>Total 233 points<br><br>HP Max: 414<br>Monk 6d8<br>Cleric 27d8<br>WM 7d10<br>Con +2*40<br><br><br>AC:32 <br>wearing woodsman outfit and unbuffed<br>10 base,<br>6 from Dex,<br>5 from Wis,<br>1 from Monk,<br>8 from Tumble,<br>2 Armor Skin,<br><br><br><br>AB with 2 normal kamas, <br>34/31/28/25/22/19<br>34/31<br><br><br><br>End Saves<br><br>Fort   25<br>Reflex 28<br>Will   28<br>additional +8 vs spells from spellcraft<br><br><br>Advantages:<br>-10 attack per round with Lv20 Darkfire, Lv15 Divine Favor.<br> Even higher damage output when server provides element damage weapons.<br>-Buffs, immunities, SR 39.<br>-Immune to Greater Dispelling<br>-Improved Invisibility<br>-Save money by buffing to +5 weapon, armor and deflection.<br>-Harm used with buffed up AB.<br>-Mass Heal for the undead.<br>-Divine Power and Aura of vitality will raise Str to 22.<br>-Extended round/level spells last for 54 rounds.<br>-Level 9 spells, many spells per level.<br>-Trickery domain with Dex build for doors, chests, and 14 Int for skills and traps.<br>-While Ultravision allow me to see inside his Darkness spell,  the on-hit visual effect of Divine Favor lights up the area just fine for me to see.<br>-Stacking blade barriers and extended blade barriers can stop an advancing army dead.

Hmmmm, hard to say... you take what, 3 epic feats? too much pre-epics taken on epics due to the WM.<br><br>I'd hardly say it's a good option to take WM 7 here, WM makes you lose much more than what you gain, it's 5 feats, which you don't have to spare and the benefits aren't so big, the critical power and range are not so important when your AB is so low. Your AC is not such a big deal either, since you have to go without heavy armor due to monk.<br><br>I don't really like it...<br><br>I'd strip up all WM and its feats, probably add Fighter (lots of feats and EWS) or Ranger (Improved Two Weapon Fighting automatic at level 9) instead, and mostly pre-epic in decent amounts for BAB... because I don't trust Divine Power's duration and it counts against the +20 cap.

I have to agree with Thaxll'ssyllia, the WeaponMaster is killing this build.  I did a quick re-hash using CoT and you can see the results below.  A +2 gain to the AB by using Epic feats for Great Dex and also a Wisdom score of 22 (good for saves and AC and +1 on your Spell DC's).  I also traded some Intelligence for Strength.<br><br>I would still be wary of this build, as it has no Uncanny Dodge with such a high Dex score.  It's not unmanageable, per se, but anything leaving you flat-footed, would tear you up.<br><br>However, if you took the Cleric domain War or Animal, you would be able to cast an Empowered Cats grace (+3 Dex modifier). Add that to an Empowered Owls Wisdom (+3 Wisdom Modifier) for a nice +6 AC boost. <br><br>The naked AB isn't very good, but Divine Favor and Greater Magic Weapon will help a bit.<br><br>Anyway, just a suggestion....<br><br>Str 14<br>Dex 16 (26)<br>Con 14<br>Wis 14 (22)<br>Int 10<br>Cha 8<br><br><br>Leveling<br><br>1 Monk(1) Two Weapon Fighting<br>2 Cleric(1)<br>3 Cleric(2) Weapon Finesse<br>4 Cleric(3) Dex+1(17)<br>5 Cleric(4)<br>6 Cleric(5) Ambidexterity<br>7 Monk(2)<br>8 Cleric(6) Wis+1(15)<br>9 Cleric(7) Weapon Focus: Kama<br>10 Cleric(8)<br>11 Cleric(9)<br>12 Monk(3) Wis+1(16) Empower Spell<br>13 Cleric(10)<br>14 Cleric(11)<br>15 Cleric(12) Improved Two Weapon Fighting<br>16 CoT (1) DEX+1(18)<br>17 Monk(4)<br>18 CoT (2) Blind Fight*, Improved Critical: Kama<br>19 CoT (3)<br>20 CoT (4) Extend Spell*, Wis+1(17)<br><br>21 CoT (5) Great Dexterity I<br>22 Cleric(13)<br>23 CoT (6) Epic Weapon Focus: Kama*<br>24 CoT (7) Wis+1(18), Great Dexterity II<br>25 CoT (8) Great Wisdom I*<br>26 Cleric(14)<br>27 Monk(5) Epic Prowess<br>28 Cleric(15) WIS+1(20)<br>29 Cleric(16)<br>30 Cleric(17) Great Dexterity III<br>31 Cleric(18)<br>32 Cleric(19) Dex+1(22)<br>33 Cleric(20) Great Dexterity IV<br>34 Cleric(21)<br>35 Cleric(22)<br>36 Cleric(23) Dex+1(25) Great Dexterity VI, Great Wisdom II<br>37 Monk(6)<br>38 Cleric(24)<br>39 Cleric(25) Great Dexterity III, Armor Skin<br>40 Cleric(26) Wis+1(22)<br><br>*Bonus CoT Spell<br><br>AB 36 - [BAB 26 + Dex 8 + WF 1 + EWF 2 + EP 1 - 2WF 2]<br>AC 35 - [Base 10 + Dex 8 + Tumble 8 + Monk 1 + Wis 6 + Armor Skin 2]
