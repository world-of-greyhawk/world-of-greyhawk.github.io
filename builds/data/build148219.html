Discipline is the one thing that's sorely lacking, but cross class and without any focuses in it, it won't help much.

Looks like a very nice build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>If you want Elemental Shape you could probably drop 2 SD levels, I don't think it'll hurt much. For Improved Elemental Shapes you'll need to rearrange some more, either drop SD to 1 (HIPS only) or you go to 16 shifter levels and level 4 SD, losing 1 epic bonus feat (probably Epic Skill Focus in hide or so).<br><br>I don't know if the (Improved) Elemental Shapes are really worth that, but should be possible to fit them in and still have the hiding stuff. Maybe I'll try it tonight if I have some time to spare <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .

Unfortunately I goofed somewhat on the shadowdancer prerequisites, as it's 8 move silently, not 7.  Just bump it up to 8 on the level before you take the SD level and take 2 away from concentration and it should work.<br><br>You'd lose Slippery Mind if you went 16/19/5, but might be worth it for elemental shapes, since you don't have construct.  If you go all out with 20/19/1, the elder shapes are nice, but you also lose Evasion and Uncanny Dodge.  You also lose out somewhat on the playability from 1-40, but might be something to consider for a pure 40 build. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>(edit)<br><br>Another slight goof: you get +5 from barkskin at that point, not +4... so that's 58 AC buffed, not 57.<br>_________________<br>"Intelligence is knowing a tomato is a fruit; Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad."<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By MA Sword on 08/17/04 09:39</span></i></p>

Slippery mind isn't a big loss in this build. You should have a pretty solid will save as it stands with your WIS as high as it is and druid's saves. Keep in mind your epic greater wildshape levels. Also your dragon breath is based on your total druid and shifter levels.

Good call on the dragon breath, had almost forgotten about that.<br><br>I still like Slippery Mind since your will saves aren't going to be incredible (though your 30 wisdom makes sure they're not too bad either, that's true).  With 8/8/4 druid/shifter/SD pre-epic, your will save is going to be +9 at 20, +19 at 40.  +10 wisdom minimum gives you +29.  So on second thought... yeah, it's not the most needed/useful thing.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Defensive roll definitely isn't worth the 5 SD levels, so the only real reason for having so many is the playability factor from 1-40.  For a pure 40 build, going 2 SD (get one around 20 or so so you can bump up your move silently for the epic skill focus) would probably be best.  19 druid/19 shifter/2 SD for more druid power or 16 druid/22 shifter/2 SD for another epic shape feat would be the way to go in this case.<br>_________________<br>"Intelligence is knowing a tomato is a fruit; Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad."<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By MA Sword on 08/17/04 20:48</span></i></p>

Wisdom = Start (18) + Adding points (8) + GW I-V (5) = 31<br><br>So you can take away "GW V".<br><br><br>The original poster said to add Greater Wisdom 1-5 plus devote 8 of your 10 ability points to wisdom. Also start at 18 Wisdom.<br><br>That gives you a total of 31. The author said 30. Plus I believe the extra point is wasted.<br><br>Edit: By not taking GW V (as the author said), you get an extra feat to play with.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Banshe on 03/16/05 14:56</span></i></p>
