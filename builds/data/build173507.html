The anti-rogue in my mind is a cleric.<br><br>They can see you, cast death spells on you, and bash you into little pieces if they are buffed.<br><br>But Self Concealment 5 and Epic Dodge help you to cope with the "Bashing" part.<br><br>Clerics still have the edge on you, but you are a little more resiliant now.<br><br>To me, this build looks like a mix of heavy sneak attacker and light fighter. And that is fine with me, as I like versitile characters. Others might say that you should choose one or the other if you want the most powerful version of the build. So if you want power, then decide to be either rogue or light fighter. If rogue then drop the SV 5 and take Improved Sneak Attack instead (keep the Epic Dodge, just in case). If light fighter then take a lot more SD levels (the higher the better).

i'd also like to get people's opinions on the improved initiative feat vs. toughness.  which would be better overall, for pvp, for pvm, for quests?  this build ends up having around 500 hp with items on the PW i play on without the toughness feat.

You're DEX based, so my opinion is the Imp Initiative feat is probably not necessary. I'd go for the Toughness feat. While 1 extra HP per level isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread either, it will extend your survivability a bit, which is good for a DEX-based build as they generally take longer to drop their opponents due to lower damage output (not a concern if you can sneak attack them of course).<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

that's the thing, since i don't do much melee damage, i want to ensure i get the first KD to do my crippling strike and sneak attack damage, so that was my reasoning with imp init.  what do you think?  any other comments on the build?

I agree with Master Cinn, re: toughness over initiative, which checks are based on dex, with each character applying his/her dex mod to the roll, such that more HPs would seem to do you more good (for more info about it, see: <a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Initiative" target="_blank">http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Initiative</a><br><br>Another to really consider instead of impr.initiative as you've taken on more ftr, might really want to consider picking up WS+EWS; this will give you +6 damage every time you deal with your dagger, which should help you out a bit when you factor in dual-wielding. That said, HPs are always good, too. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good [people] to do nothing" -- Edmund Burke, Philosopher and Politician (1729-1797)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 09/05/07 14:01</span></i></p>

the way i'm thinking of improved init is "extra insurance" for a first strike against high dex builds, which tend to have low discipline, and which i will be attempting KD on. i understand that i'm going to have an init mod of around +18 with items, but wouldn't +22 be nice? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Sure, higher is better, and against other high DEX builds it may indeed make a difference. If that's why you want the feat, then go for it. It's certainly not going to hurt the build.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

You could switch Epic Prowess with EWF Dagger.  That way you'd gain +1 AB sooner and your build would not change in the end.

i'd prefer to keep that order because i'll be using my bow more often at those levels on my PW, but that is definitely something i hadn't thought of.  thanks<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By fbr123 on 09/05/07 19:49</span></i></p>

Oh, I didn't see any mention of a bow being used for that build.<br><br>Perhaps you could also add your hunting tactics to this thread.  Sometimes people come up with clever tactical combinations that others may find insightful.

i find myself, due to low ab, to often hang back in boss battles and using my bow and scrolls, which is a +10 weapon as opposed to my +6 daggers.  not much tactics involved there, i just want to be more useful on boss runs earlier, and epic prowess gives me +1 to hit with a bow (and also my daggers).<br><br>there aren't a lot of hunting tactics that i use besides dagger in the main hand, shield in off hand, and KD spam for crit immune monsters, and hips, sneak, repeat for sneak attack vulnerable monsters.  use of the bow in boss battles allows me to stand back and use rez scrolls, mordenkainen's, etc.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By fbr123 on 09/05/07 21:20</span></i></p>
