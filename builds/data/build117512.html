pretty interrested in your build here.  like the idea of a sling.   i know it has been a while since you posted this build, but i just came across it.<br><br>i have a question for you..  could you subsitute 2 lvls fo BG for one lvl of ftr and the lvl of palidin?  if i am not mistaken, you would still get the chra bonus to saves and you would also get another bulls str spell, which i beleive stacks with teh cleric spell.<br>just though i would ask you.

Slim, this build was built last spring when the bug was still in effect.  I doubt the author even checks in here anymore to update.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

Oh, that's what I get for replying to a post at 1 AM. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Sorry about that. I guess I wasn't thinking when I wrote that. (happens a lot these days...)<br><br>Anyway, sorry to point out the fault in the way I did <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> . <br><br>It's still true, though. Divine Power was fixed in some patch (1.64, 1.63 or some other quite recent patch). <br><br>So don't go wondering if you don't get that 5th attack after all =).

This build looks totally awesome and I play clerics anyway.  I've started this build on two different servers.  So far it's very fun.
