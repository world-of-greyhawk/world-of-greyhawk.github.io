I would dump Whirldwind Attack.  It's still buggy.<br><br>That could bump your feats down a notch into pre-epic and free up an epic slot for Epic Skill focus Intimidate.

It's nice, but you are definitely feat starved, as a STR based sneaker, you should have Knockdown no matter what, yet you don't... in my opinion, if you're going to make a Weapon Master with Devastating Critical, you need Fighter or Champion of Torm levels to make up for the feats, for your Barbarian here I'd drop Devastating Critical (and Overwhelming, Great Cleave, Cleave, Power attack altogether) for maybe Knockdown, Improved Knockdown, Epic Prowess and Great Strength II. Or forget about Weapon Master for Fighter and get a Dev Crit with a higher STR score.<br><br>Your AB is not too bad, but it's not good either, it is low if you're pretending to make dev crits with the max scimitar critical threat range, you just won't hit them. You need to be able to hit before you are able to make a critical hit.<br><br>Hmmm, BAB 26... I would take Barbarian levels pre-epic to raise your BAB, only 4 Rogue levels pre-epic for skilldumps would raise it by 3 points, it is playable to be a Barbarian as well so that's no problem... you should pay more attention to raising your AB, it's the most important stat IMO.<br><br>EDIT: Wait a second, why the hell are you a Halfing!? you need to take Human on such feat starved builds, that's a must, even Half-Orc would be fine since it's a STR based Barbarian but <b>Halfings get penalty to STR</b>, while the bonus to DEX is wasted if you keep it at 14, that explains why your CON is so low, man, seriously, taking Halfing is completely wrong on this build as it is, the worst race you could pick.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

I'd definitely look at trying to grab some BBN levels earlier. If nothing else, you could skill dump into Taunt on a regular basis to give yourself that much of an edge. And I agree that KD and Imp KD would be a huge asset to this build, since you're playing a short guy.<br><br>As far as the race goes, sure there are better choices, but a Halfling BBN/WM/Rogue is just cool.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I used halfling because when haflings use two handed weapons  the entire world cries. Thanks for the advice about the dev crit i was kindve iffy on whether i should go for it because you use so many epic feat slots on pre epic feats. dont you get a str bonus to dmg or attack when you use two handed weapons?

Hmmmm, halfing to use the scimitar as a two handed weapon, well, I admit it's a good reply, I was unable to think on any logical reason but that is an acceptable one. Still, you spend 16 ability points to get start on 16 STR with a Halfing, that would be 20 STR on a Half-Orc, I just can't believe it.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

1/2 Orc aside, the -2 racial adjustment isn't that big a deal. You're only 1 AB behind any other build (other than Gnome) with the same investment in STR. Sure it may raise the eyebrows of a min/maxer, but it's certainly nothing that's going to cripple the character.<br><br>*edit* Actually, you're on even footing with any other character, and only 1 behind the 1/2 Orc, since you get the Small Stature +1 AB boost.<br><br>I've played a number of STR-based Halflings and even some 1/2 Orc Wizards.
