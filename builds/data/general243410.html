Alright, as your keen intellect has surely uncovered the meaning of this post, I will get right into it.<br><br>A Dragonshaped Druid with Improved Knockdown gets how much of a bonus to their AB on the attempt? +4 per size catagory larger? So a Dragon is Gargantuan, I think that is 3 sizes larger. But with Improved Knockdown they get an extra +4, so does that mean they get +12 AB on top of their normal AB while using knockdown?<br><br>Also, I heard that a Dragon that uses Improved Disarm on a small weapon, will have the weapon land in his inventory, true? False?<br><br>Infact, could someone *coughs* Kail the Dragon-Man *coughs* break down the whole Dragonshape for me? I think it goes like this:<br><br>Weapons: +6 Claws which pass all but Epic Warding<br>DR: 40/+6 withstanding all spell-buffed weapons aside from fellow Dragons<br>Effects: Permanent True Sight, Immunity to Mind Spells... and what else?<br><br>Do they get better SR? Other Immunities? Abilites?<br><br>And... I had more but I forgot...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Okembour on 06/09/06 20:00</span></i></p>

They changed the KD advantage? Why? It made sense that a friggin' Gargantuan Dragon could tip over a halfling like an insect. But IKD counts you as 1 size catagory bigger. That is the whole point of the feat, right? So would that give a bonus to AB? Or is that feat useless now?

In fact, if you look at it from the size/rules perspective, larger creatures actually get a penalty to hit smaller ones, so the AB boost that formerly was granted made absolutely no sense whatsoever.

The numbers you speak of are not bonus to AB like Cinn says, but it's an increase in the DC to resist the knockdown. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

The NWNWiki has got a nice entry on dragon shape now <a href="http://www.nwnwiki.org/Dragon_shape" target="_blank">click here</a><br><br>Regarding Disarm, yes even in DS weapons go in your inventory and although your claws should be considered size Huge weapons there's no AB bonus to Disarm: you always hit at -6/-4 penalty (Disarm/ID) for attempting the maneuver, no matter your opponent's weapon (size). <b>Actually this is a bug</b>, cause even in human form if you attempt a disarm barehanded no matter your enemy's weapon size, you get just the -6/-4 standard penalty (for no difference in disarming/defending weapon size). It's basically to say that unarmed attack is considered always the same size as the defending weapon when attempting a disarm with it (no matter whether its tiny human fists, huge dragon claws or whatever else). If you try disarming a greatsword wielder with a dagger you get the normal -16 penalty (-4 + -4x3 size categories of difference).<br><br>A Dragon's size is Huge, btw, not Gargantuan. SR is 20 and it cannot be increased but only overridden (Spell Resistance spell, e.g.).<br><br><i>Edited misleading info, added unarmed disarm bug comment</i><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Wait for me Dragon, we'll meet in the sky<br>By fire and magic, I'm sworn<br>Hell is calling, we cannot be denied<br>Fly to the blackness of the Storm<br><br>We must die to be reborn!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 06/10/06 03:22</span></i></p>

Interesting, Kail. This means the monks unarmed disarm is quite okay then, contrary to what people say. Have you reported this bug?<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

It is so, monk's unarmed disarm is not that bad, it gets -4 to hit (per normal ID attempt within the same size category) and that's it, no further mali of sorts. This is unfortunate for Dragon Shape though, as you can easily see.<br><br>I will report it, although I wonder whether it will be considered a bug at all or it is WAD *shrugs*<br><br>Check it out yourself buddy, least I report something that maybe ain't working properly only on my computer for some misterious reasons (like EP not working with Monk for Robert "Deborah" Tyr).<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free
