Introduction:<br>Twilight of the Idols (yeah, I've been reading <i>Nietzsche</i> again <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"> <i></i>)<br><br>This build was discussed in <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13422", "240476", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>this thread</a> and I decided to make my version. I'd like to thank everyone who contributed to that thread, as I was inspired by it. I built this, tested some, changed a few, and now I'm pretty contented <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>I was quite short on attribute points with this build -- STR for AB, CON for HP, INT for spells, WIS for spells, CHA for Divine abilities, but in the end I think it turned out pretty nicely. The AB is too low for most but low magic environments (as the buffs count more there), but it's still a decent build and should be fun to play. The only thing I feel really lessens the enjoyment is that you get gain your best spellcasting ability in late epics, and your caster level is still relatively low.<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Alignment: LG -&gt; LN (-&gt; LG)<br><br>Attributes:<br><br>Starting<br>--------<br>15 Strength<br>08 Dexterity<br>12 Constitution<br>14 Intelligence<br>14 Wisdom<br>14 Charisma<br><br>Ending (5 to Strength, 4 to Charisma, 1 to Intelligence)<br>------<br>20 Strength<br>08 Dexterity<br>12 Constitution<br>19 Intelligence<br>14 Wisdom<br>18 Charisma<br><br>Levels:<br><br>Guide<br>-----<br><br>1.

I'd actually think the original thread-poster's level split was a better idea.  I think you just lose too much AB by going spellsword and pumping your Int with this build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br>I'd just take the minimum wizard levels and sacrifice spellcasting, instead pushing the PM levels for the most bonus AC.  Or alternately, taking few PM levels and more paladin levels, maybe changing the other class to sorcerer if I were going to cast and using divine shield/might.<br><br>But you have an interesting compromise here, certainly seems like a fun build, if not the strongest.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Aye, I would think that the natural class split would be a Pally/Sorc/PM here. More synergy, and 1 less stat to have to pump.  Or, in those crazy worlds where alignment changing is done easily, a Pally/Bard/PM.  Now that would be cheesy, Max taunt,tumble, UMD, curse, , bard song, and then immune to crits and high AC to go along with it.  Of course, the bad part with Sorc is that you won't get the PM spell slots added in, but I would use this guy more for melee anyways.<br>_________________<br>Untutored courage is useless in the face of educated bullets.

Well, I also see it as a melee, I'd actually take more Paladin pre-epic instead of Pale Master, to max BAB, but you'd lose spells. A tricky combination, since I don't really see Pale Master as a good casting option, your spells would be so much stronger with a Paladin 20 / Sorcerer 20, but whatever, I'm just rambling, I don't intend to change the purpose of the build.<br><br>The stats are good, however, you could get overall higher ratings if you change CHA for STR and forget about Divine feats (which would make Extra Turning and Extra Smiting almost useless, I'd change them anyway lol), granted, you lose Divine Shield AC and saves, but the damage will be the same and the AB will come on every hit and not only on Smites, apart from that you won't be relying on Divine and CHA buffing, also freeing feats for more metamagic, weapon focus, improved critical or blind-fight.

Finding the balance is often the problem in such builds without the obvious synergies. You say yourself you had tried, changed, tweaked and finally you found where it balances out best.
