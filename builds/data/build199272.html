The Skillful Minstrel - an attempt to come up with a Bard build that is good at melee, yet really utilizes the skillset of the Bard to its fullest potential.<br><br><b>Playable from level 1.</b> Intended (as all my builds are) for <b>PvM.</b><br><br>Combining the high STR of the RDD and the skillset of the Bard into a potent mix of hitting power and excellent skills, the Skillful Minstrel has the capability of combining raw brute force with Bard Song, Curse Song, and various skills to become a force to be reckoned with. Spellcasters are going to have a hell of a time landing any spells that allow saves on this character once his Bard Song is active, as the combined boost provides an excellent +12 on his saves vs spells. As well, his Taunt DC is 70, which is probably going to mean 30% chance of spell failure for any caster within his reach.<br><br>Against melee opponents, he has 34 base STR for a +12 modifier on damage, +44 to hit with his weapon of choice, and can further enhance damage and to-hit potential with a level 22 Bard Song and Curse Song. Trying to KD or Disarm the Skillful Minstrel? Good luck. With a whopping 76 in Discipline, that attempt's likely doomed to failure.<br><br>Still Spell allows him to utilize all his available spells except the level 6 spells - but if you're lucky enough to be playing where you can get armor with 0% spell failure, you'll really be rocking.<br><br>A note: I realize this build doesn't have Dev Crit. Quite frankly, I'm tired of building everything with Dev Crit as the ultimate goal. This build is an attempt to do something a bit different, while still remainaing an effective character.<br><br>If Dev Crit is a must, feats can be switched out in order to facilitate it, but you'll lose some of the Epic Skill Focus feats, which is the point of this particular build.<br><br>Particular thanks go to Grizzled_Dwarflord for helpful suggestions and also steering me into going the way I did with this build.

That's what I did with my defending champion build too. I really didn't care about dev crit, because it is overused, and a good character should be able to win fights just as easily without it as they can with it. <br>Nice build.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

This means you actually have a level 24 Curse Song when you use it. It only means a hit of 4 more HPs and a couple less on the enemy's skills, but every little but helps. (If you can boost your CHA by 8, you'll get an added boost to the Curse song of another -2 HPs, -1 AC, and -1 skills for your opponents)<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Just posted a response and it got lost.  Bloody hell.<br><br>Anyways, my suggestion was this:  Drop Dex to 8.  Your Cat's Grace lasts all day and will make up the difference.  Raise Con to 15.  Drop Epic Prowess in Epic and take Great Con.  Combined with Bardsong, this will give you a 116 Hitpoint net increase, 120 if you go 26th Bard.  You wont see bards with that many levels running around with that many hitpoints.  Or, you could keep Epic Prowess, drop 2 great strength feats, and take 1 Great Con and Toughness.  With you Bardsong, this would be an obscene 160 Hitpoint increase.  This would also give him a slightly better Fort save.  Reflex takes a hit, but who cares about reflexes?  Get some boots or something.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Bloody hell.<br><br>Anyways, my suggestion was this:  Drop Dex to 8.  Your Cat's Grace lasts all day and will make up the difference.  Raise Con to 15.  Drop Epic Prowess in Epic and take Great Con.  Combined with Bardsong, this will give you a 116 Hitpoint net increase, 120 if you go 26th Bard.  You wont see bards with that many levels running around with that many hitpoints.  Or, you could keep Epic Prowess, drop 2 great strength feats, and take 1 Great Con and Toughness.  With you Bardsong, this would be an obscene 160 Hitpoint increase.  This would also give him a slightly better Fort save.  Reflex takes a hit, but who cares about reflexes?  Get some boots or something.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Now, that's an interesting possibility. My only problem with it is this: I hate relying on spells to boost DEX to an acceptable level (just a quirk of mine). Besides, this character won't get Cat's Grace until 4th Bard level, which means level 12 of the build. To me, that's a long time to go without guaranteed access to DEX buffs and a penalty to ranged combat and Reflex saves.<br><br>The build doesn't take any GRT STR feats, but as for the bigger CON, a possibility there would be to start with 14 STR, raising CON to 15 at the start. Take GRT CON instead of Epic Prowess and take Toughness instead of Imp Crit (Chances are you'll find a keen weapon anyway - and if you don't, you've got your Keen Edge spell. The extra threat range from Imp Crit will most likely seldom come into play for the most part)<br><br>Final STR would be 32 and final CON would be 18. Including the Toughness feat, that's 120 more HPs (154 with bard Song) with only 2 less AB. Quite possibly an acceptable trade-off.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

What is the reason for Artist, Skill Focus Perform, and Epic Skill Focus Perform?  The bonuses from perform additions add very little to Bard Song, basically just hit points and skills.  On the other hand, it costs the build at least Great Cleave and Improved Knockdown.

One of the difficulties with the Bard class (as far as i can tell) is that the perform skill far outstripes the range of what a character can achieve.  What i mean, looking at this chart <a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Bard_song" target="_blank">http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Bard_song</a> it seems that anything higher than 24 bard can become hard to hit for the bard song/curse bonus'.  <br><br>In a more elaborate way than what Finn said, he takes these feats to try to get Perform up to 70 WITHOUT resorting to gear.  IT only makes it that much easier to achieve with gear.   THis is why we call our guild, Epic Character builders, imvho.  We (some of us) have tried to achieve the ultimate WITHOUT gear taken into consideration, so that when you add  gear, the character becomes even more so..<br><br>IOW, Read the description...  sorry Finn<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

It won't help your original Bard Song, since you've already got that Bard Song active (a second singing does not override the first, even if it's better.
