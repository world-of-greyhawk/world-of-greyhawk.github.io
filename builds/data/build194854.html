Breath = Improved Whirlwind Attack, which was one of the target feats when I started the build (they're both like... air and stuff)<br><br>First time experimenting with the Initiative feats, and I probably won't get to those levels for a while if I go the SOU -&gt; Nether Scrolls / Shadohaunt -&gt; HotU route.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By sketchy_c on 05/16/05 15:41</span></i></p>

very nice build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     its too bad we cant add a fourth class: fightr!  to get epic wpn spec!   (im not sayin to replace ranger with fightr cuz that would be silly)  Its just that when you see how many attacks the pc gets with mundane wpns one sorta gets to wish they could get the damage up (which is why you have some fav enemies, i know).<br><br>Thanks for postin this one. <br><br>Peace
