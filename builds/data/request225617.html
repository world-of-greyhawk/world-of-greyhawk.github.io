Hello everyone, looking for yet another build. I was going to figure it out for myself, but I simply cannot determine a proper amount of levels to utilize their strengths.<br><br>The basic premise is this: Wizard for buffing spells, Assassin for Sneaking, Sneak Attacks, and the Death Attack Paralysis, and Arcane Archer to make up for the lost AB that you'll take from putting points into Intelligence.<br><br>Now, I know Death Attack is bugged, so there's no need to tell me about it, but I'd still like to see the build, just for curiousity sake. I figure that you only need 6th level spells or so, to utilize the best defensive buffs. If need be you could go higher for some Bigby/No Save things, but your intelligence would never really be high enough to get a decent DC with spells. Focusing in Assassin and Arcane Archer moreso seems better to me.<br><br>Thanks in advance, if anyone decides to pick this up and run with it for me.<br><br>~Acothea

So why not go for wizard/rogue/AA? You don't need the assassin spells so you only lose the paralyze attack. In every other aspect the wizard/rogue/AA is superior imho.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&amp;id=6445" target="_blank">Customize Character override hak</a>: Modify/dye armor, cloak, ... change portrait, head, tail, wings, tattoos, hair/skin color, rename, glowing eyes... in game.

I agree. doing a WIZ/ROG would make it better.6W/4r/10AA split pre epic. Or 4w/6r perhaps. Even 8R/4W/8AA would ensure you 4 attacks pre epic. As for the final level split, I don't know...... I can look into it, as will others. If you for some reason don't wanna change classes, the pre-epic split will be like 12w/4AA/4Asn, preferably even 12W/8AA.......

I'd prefer for it to remain Assassin. Mostly because of the Roleplay value of it, as well as the Int for both Death Attack and Spells being the main reason I thought of the concept *shrugs*<br><br>If no one's willing, then that's fine, I'll test it myself later on.

The ability itself isnt' bugged, only the circumstances. If you're not in a party, or on a server without parties, then it'll work fine, but on most arena servers you are in a party.<br><br>When anyone near (not even really that near) your victim, you, or you or your victim's teamates are in battle, then the Death Attack Paralysis doesn't work at all.<br><br>So, that means in most arena servers the only way you'll get the paralysis in a party is if -everyone- is on another side of the map, or -no one- is fighting.<br><br>There are the few rare times that this works, though. It'd be great for a non-party Action server or some'at.
