A couple things. 15 rounds is short for things like DP, even extended to 30. DP in shifted forms add another attack at a further -3, not at full BAB like in unshifted builds.

On the other hand, his Extended Aura of Vitality and Extended Blood Frenzy should last a more decent 48 rounds.<br><br>The AB is from the Character Sheet or from Feedback? the Character sheet is wrong in shapeshifted ABs.<br><br>LOL, a dragon with a summoned dragon, well, in fact, I think the summoned dragon is pretty bad, he's too big for regular areas and actually casts some of useless weak spells, you could get a better use of summons with Elemental Swarm, I like it because the next elemental form appears even if he was unsommoned by spells, and works very well as bait since it gives a large amount of summon HP cover if you are casting spells.

Nice dragon you've got there!<br><br>I'd swap War domain for Trickery. II greatly improves the build IMO, while battle mastery makes little difference and AoV is already in your druid spellbook. Cat's grace is nice but a potion will do.<br><br>Travel domain is nice to have, unless you can find a permahaste armor, in which case I'd swap it for something else.<br><br>I'd consider goin Druid 22/Cleric 17 or even Druid 20/Cleric 17/Monk 3, skipping the epic spells which are no big deal anyhow and SP feats, getting more great WIS and qualifying for DS earlier (33rd lvl). CC/ICC can be dropped, cast in defensive casting mode and save two feats. IKD and EP are feats worth considering as is blind fight. <br><br>I'd definitely get more cleric lvls preepic, 12 or 16 if going for 17 final cleric lvls. Cleric survivability is out of question. I guess CHA 14 is for battle mastery, but I don't think it's worth the investment. Rise STR, DEX and CON 2 points each for increased playability at earlier lvls. I'd also pick empower over maximize.<br><br>Just a few tweaks from a dragon lover <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Wait for me Dragon, we'll meet in the sky<br>By fire and magic, I'm sworn<br>Hell is calling, we cannot be denied<br>Fly to the blackness of the Storm<br><br>We must die to be reborn!

You could also start with 16 INT, for more skills, if you like, since, aside from playability, when shapeshifted, having invested in CON, DEX and STR will be useless.

Oh I'm sorry about the other builds, lol <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  <br><br>I was thinking that trickery would be better for the concealment.
