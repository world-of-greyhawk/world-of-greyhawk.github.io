I have read most of the Figher/Cleric/WM builds in the many pages of posts.  I will be using the build from level 1 in a PW and my PW is a level cap of 30.  Therefore some of the "Divine" builds don't work out as well as posted.<br><br>I'd like the build to have a melee focus.<br><br>Anyone care to help me out with this level 30 build?<br><br>Thanks!

Off the top of my head I'd suggest 6 levels of fighter, 5 taken pre epic to get weapon spec, and 1 level at epic for epic weapon spec. 7 levels of weapon master all pre epic, and the rest (17 levels) of cleric to get 9th level spells. At 20th you'd have F5/WM7/C8 giving a BAB of 18.<br><br>Stats are hard. You have so many requirements that your stat allocation will be pretty flat. You only get 7 stat raises by 30th level too.<br><br>Str 14 - need reasonable str to carry heavy armour<br>Dex 13 - required for WM<br>Con 14 - all clerics are good cons <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br>Wis 14 - Main stat<br>Int 13 - required for WM<br>Cha 10 - could sacrifice 2 points here but would lower turns<br><br>Use stat raises on wisdom. You need 19 wis base to cast 9th level spells. With one Greater Wis you can get it to 22.<br><br>Feats will also be tight. You get 9 pre-epic and 5 epic feats. Pre-epic you will need: Dodge, Mobility, Expertise, Spring Attack, Weapon Focus and Whirlwind Attack for Weapon Master. Add Weapon Specialization and Improved Crits leaving one spare. Probably need a metafeat like empower or extend spell, or even combat casting. <br><br>Epic feats you will need epic weapon spec and focus, and maybe epic prowess. 2 spare could be improved combat casting and possible 1 stat raise (for an even number of stat raises).<br><br>Skills will also be short. You should get around 160 point to spend. Prime candidates are discipline, concentration and spellcraft.<br><br>Disclaimer: all this is off the top of my head (boring day at work <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> )

I probably wouldn't bother taking WM levels if you're only going up to lvl 30.  If you're taking 40 levels, you can do something like a Fighter 6/Cleric 15/WM 19, and that gives you a decent bonus to AB from Superior Weapon Focus, and also a few bonus feats from WM.  That said, if you were only taking 7 levels of WM, it probably wouldn't be worth it for what you would be getting (+2 to threat range and +1x to critical multiplier).<br><br>Rather than WM, I would suggest something like a Rogue 11/Cleric 15/Fighter 6.  You save a bunch of feats by not taking WM levels, you don't need as much Dex to start with (and you can get Improved Evasion to cover your low Dex), you get a lot more skill credits, and you can still do decent damage to non-crit immune foes (actually, you can do better against PM builds, as they are crit immune but not sneak immune).<br><br>If you really do want to do a Fighter/Cleric/WM build, I would suggest Fighter 8/Cleric 15/WM 7.  Race should be either Human or Dwarven, although I would probably go Human for the extra feat and skill credits.

Your version has -1 to BAB due to getting that 9th cleric level pre-epic. My version you'd have to wait a bit longer to get epic weapon spec, but end up with +1 BAB.

your proberly better off with fighter4/cleric16/cot10 for a warrior cleric build. much easer on the stats and feats, so you can have a better strength from stat points and great str (so a better to hit and damage)and spell feats selection
