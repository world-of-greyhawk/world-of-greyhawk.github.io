The Shadow from Beyond<br>Here's my all time favorite Roleplaying build . . . He seems playable through all levels. RP is why you see high Pursuade, Pick Pocket and Lore.<br>10 levels of SD becuase, well, I hate just taking one for HiPs. I really enjoy the SD concept so . . . that's the way it goes.<br><br>Race: Shadowswyft (Outsider, Darkvison, Blooded, Skill Affinity: Mv Silent &amp; Hide, Light Blindness (bummer but very cool)<br>Str - 10<br>Dex - 18 -&gt; 28<br>Int - 16<br>Con - 10<br>Wis - 10<br>Chr - 10<br><br>1 Rogue - Dodge, 1d6 Sneak<br>2 Rogue - Evasion<br>3 Rogue - Mobility, Uncanny Dodge I, 2d6 Sneak<br>4 Rogue - +1 dex<br>5 Rogue - 3d6 Sneak<br>6 Rogue - Uncanny Dodge II, Spring Attack<br>7 Rogue - 4d6 Sneak<br>8 SD - +1 Dex, HiPS<br>9 SD - Blindfight<br>10 TSL - Shadow Jump, Spell Level 1<br>11 TSL - Shadow Blur<br>12 TSL - +1 Dex, Spell Level 2, Weapon Finess<br>13 TSL - Shadow Pounce<br>14 TSL - Shadow Discoporation, Spell Level 3<br>15 TSL - Death Attack 1d6, True Death Attack, Toughness<br>16 SD - +1 Dex, Shadow daze, Summon Shadow<br>17 Rogue -<br>18 SD - Iron Will, Shadow Evade<br>19 SD - Defensive Roll<br>20 SD - +1 Dex<br>21 SD - Slippery Mind, Ambi-Dex<br>22 SD -<br>23 SD -<br>24 SD - +1 Dex, TwF, Improved Evasion, Uncanny Dodge III<br>25 Rogue - 5d6 Sneak<br>26 Rogue - Crippling Strike<br>27 Rogue - 6d6 Sneak, ITwF<br>28 Rogue - +1 Dex<br>29 Rogue - 7D6 Sneak, Epic Dodge<br>30 Rogue - Uncanny Dodge IV, GTwF<br>31 Rogue - 8d6 Sneak<br>32 Rogue - +1 Dex, Improved Sneak I, Uncanny Dodge V<br>33 Rogue - 9d6 Sneak, Lingering Damage<br>34 Rogue - Uncanny Dodge VI<br>35 Rogue - 10D6 Sneak, Improved Sneak II<br>36 Rogue - +1 Dex,Uncanny Dodge VI+, Improved Sneak III<br>37 Rogue - 11d6 Sneak<br>38 Rogue -<br>39 Rogue - 12d6 Sneak, Improved Sneak IV<br>40 Rogue - +1 Dex, Improved Sneak V<br><br>AC- 27<br>HP- 239<br>Attacks- 31/26/21<br>31/26<br>Saves-<br>Fort - 16<br>Reflex- 35<br>Will - 19<br><br>Skills:<br>Disable Trap - 35<br>Hide - 58<br>Listen - 30<br>Lore - 30<br>Mv Silent - 56<br>Open lock - 39<br>Persuade - 32<br>Pick Pocket - 41<br>Search - 39<br>Spot - 38<br>Tumble - 49<br>UMD - 43<br><br>Notes:<br>17D6 Sneak + 1d6 Death Attack + Lingering Damage + 5 attacks a round = avg 540 dmg per sneak attack round or every round under the darkness.<br>Defensive Roll + Shadow Discorporation<br>Could maybe use some wpn focus and improved crit(?)<br>Every now and again Paralyisis will happen when target rolls a 1 agains DC 13 fort<br>True Death attack will occaissonlly net you a one shot kill. These last two are much more potent pre-epic (lvls 15 -19) Int Boosting is something he likes.<br>Could trade out ITwF and GTwF for Epic skill focus in Hide and Mv Silent for truely splendid Stealth powers and do away with ambi-dex and TwF for Epic skill Focus Spot and Listen so that you see and hear all.<br>UMD 43 = one scroll using dude. And he can pretty much use any item he comes across. Monk robes make him happy. This might be too high though.<br>Outsider status gives him interesting spell immunities and, alas, some scary vulnerabilities.<br>Weak Fort and Will (Iron Will helps but probably not enough, could replace it with something else easily)<br>Much duplication between Rogue and SD feats<br>Spells really help out, Haste and Darkness, Improved Invis are the ones I use most often. These sub for Self Conceal and blinding speed feats.<br>True seeing gives him fits, and the usual Rogue problems apply.<br>- Comments/Critique of course encouraged.<br>_________________<br>All GLory is Fleeting<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By williamx on 02/13/05 02:30</span></i></p>
