Yes, Divine Champion is CoT. I used DC instead since that would distinguish it from Cleric in the build outline (saves a few letters) and I've been playing with the toolset too much where CoT == DC <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>And correct about the WF, I mixed the two levels up <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  fixing that as we speak<br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while

Much as having a maxed WIS stat is great, bear in mind that you only gain one point to your spellcasting DC by starting WIS at 18. Same is true of your Will Save, and you lose 1 x 2nd and 1 x 6th level spell.<br><br>Personally starting at WIS 16 would allow you to put 2 points into DEX - giving you a DEX modifier of 3, thereby raising your Base Reflex save by 1 point. You could also raise CON by 4 points, giving you a further 80 hitpoints and Base Fort save by 1 point also.<br><br>It could be well worth it IMHO. After all if you can't beat a DC of 47 (Max possible Implosion DC with base WIS of 16 and capped WIS through items) is one more point really going to solve your problems?<br><br>Food for thought.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 02/14/06 05:08</span></i></p>

Unbuffed AB would be 25 with kama and 24 unarmed.<br><br>Max AB possible would be 24 (base with 8 STR) + 1 (focus) +6 (+12 STR) + 20 (buffs) = 51 or 49 dual wielding.<br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while

Until this build gets his kama/Monk training at Epic levels, it would appear to wield dual maces.  I find this very appealing -- rather life the bass drummer in a marching band giving his sticks a twirl before striking.  Too bad we can't craft maces with leather thongs for the same purpose: the animation sequence would be worth watching.<br><br>On a more serious note, a strength of 8 means carrying capacity of 73 lbs, which is do-able for a Dex based monk, when your super-WIS = AC bonus, but how do you campaign at lower levels with such a low cc?<br><br>Otherwise, it looks like a fun build, and I'm enjoying it (level 4 so far) Thank you!

I think you are giving up too much for the high Wis. Even fully buffed, your AB is only 51 (49 when dual-wielding), which is pretty low at level 40. I would drop starting Wis to 16, and bump Str to 14 (with no Weapon Finesse, you are taking a -1 to AB the whole build). I would also drop 2 Great Wis feats for Epic Weapon Focus and Epic Prowess. These will cost you a grand total of 4 is (2 AC and 2 spell DC), but gain you +6 AB, +3 to damage and some carrying capacity. I would also drop 1 Cleric level and 1 Monk level for CoT - this will gain you another Epic bonus feat. <br><br>Last, I would make a decision about this character - is he a melee character, or a spell caster? Right now he looks like a caster to me, but not very effective at melee due to the low AB and damage output. If he is a caster, drop the TWF feats for some metamagic feats and leave the wisdom high like you have it (he will rely on Harm, Hammer of the Gods, and Implosion, and only melee as a last resort).<br><br>If he is a melee character, drop starting Wis to 16, and only bump it to 20. Start Str at 14 and put the rest into Str, and take the combat feats I mentioned above. Drop Cleric to 26 levels (buffs can't be dispelled) and add 2 COT levels and some early monk levels (go Cleric 16 Monk 2 CoT 2 pre-epic, take the last 2 monk levels at 27 and 37). You can end up at around 26 Str, take all the combat feats, and have a decent AB (37-38 unbuffed, can reach 63-64 buffed). <br><br>TM

Just to update, I have discussing with a mate the other day and found that the build can be improved by going 32 cleric/ 2 monk / 6 CoT as the casterlevel improves by 2 at the cost of +1 saves only (well and a few hp)<br><br>Also, taking 16 cleric, 1 monk 3 CoT can improve saves for the build in general while it will weaken the build slightly due to getting a lower tumble initially (which is really only a loss of 1 AC temporarily and thus no big deal) -&gt;note BAB will stay at 15 this way <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>I've played the build for a while now and its doing quite well. You also have the option of dropping dual wield for some extra HP and 3 free feats which can be quite useful if you don't mind losing 2 attacks.<br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while
