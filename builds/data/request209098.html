I don't really see any Wiz/SD builds. Or am I better off going with the "Arcane Trebuchet" that is pure wiz? Would it be able to stand up to the "Exalted Sorc" build?<br><br>I prefer wiz to sorc just because of the variety but I've heard the "Exalted Sorc" is probally the best mage build.

I love telling this story; <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br>Think of casters as caped heros. A Wizard is like Batman, strategic, preparing the right spells for the occasion and deeply knowledgeable of the art.<br>A sorc is more like Superman. He can only do a few things well, but he can do them all day long. <br>The tradeoff is versatile vs. user-friendly. if you like knowing your limits and powering through obstacles, dorc is for you. If you like to attack a situation from the best possible angle, go with wizard.

Wizard 39/Bard 1(At 37 or later) gives him access to the best skillset available, he also has 1 more caster level than the exalted sorc and frees 4 feats (I dislike casters on armor).<br><br>Wizard 38/Ftr 1(At 20)/Bard 1(&gt;=37) makes a similar build to the sorceress without the extra saves.<br><br>What I like about taking that PG bard level is the fact that the best base 0 armor (No arcane casting failure) is made for monks, with a level of bard at 37 (or 38 if you have 8 cha), you can take your effective UMD to 40 and be able to use good equip that wont make you need to invest the still spell ones (trade them for quicken or silent spells).<br><br>If you want to stand an exalted sorceress you wont need an armor, they will rarely enter melee, and if they do their AB and damage will stink unless they use true strike, that would give you enough time to fry them.<br>_________________<br>HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh.

The ES has focused on getting higher AC, better discipline and concentration, better saves,  and evasion. Much of her qualities serve to defend her against physical attacks. <br>As a caster, she has epic focus in necromancy and 38 caster lvls. Her cha at lvl 40 is 30. Not shabby, but not extrordinary.<br>Her weakness is low HPs (256)<br>Her defense against casters is: High saves and evasion, improved combat casting and spells.<br>Against a high lvl caster, spellmantle, shadowshield, lesser mind blank and energy buffer are her best pure defensive spells. Sha has some spells that defends against low lvl magic as well, like minor globe against flame arrow.<br><br>If I were to fight her with a wizard, I would have made a pure wizard with Auto Quicken III and high spell penetration. <br>I'd start with time stop and follow with a couple of high lvl spells to wear down the spell mantle. Then I would recast TS or Bigby (7 or 9) and finish her off with non save spells like IGMS.<br>The outcome of the fight depends on who's the quickest gun-slinger. If she's hasted, she can win, otherwise, she's dead.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...
