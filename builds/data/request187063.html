I must say after playing nwn for a few years i grow tired of always having to make the most uber build i can accomplish. I would just like to ask if anyone have en idea for a low magic server with only 2 different criterias: <br><br>Warrior-type build, suited for straight ahead combat BUT still having endurance to stay put in a fight.<br><br>A sneaker-type build, with at least crippling strike and epic dodge. If not this then huge death attack and decent AB.<br><br>If anyone have the time and idea for any of this then plz post it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Okay, after looking into some stuff about the server i intend to play, i found that i NEED 20 fighter in a build. <br><br>So the idea is to create a nice fighter20/XX/XX<br><br>Ideas could be of course WM and SD/rogue. <br><br>If you have a reliant build or just a fration of an idea for such build then plz do tell <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Perhabs a pure fighter would prove fun to play <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  If anyone has an brilliant idea of optimizing such a lvl 40 fighter then bring it! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kalmar_Oxin on 03/30/05 16:52</span></i></p>

Okay a new idea.<br><br>Im looking for a pure thiefish build. <br><br>It needs to contain rogue and SD. Now here is the thing. I want to maximize the potential using bow and if it viable in some way then use assassin as well in the class mix.

How about a rogue 10 / shadowdancer 30. If its a low magic server then at level 23 if you take epic shadowlord feat you have a pet that is 100 percent resitant to fire /cold and electrical damage , immune to Critical Hits, Death Magic, Disease, Negative level, Abilitiy Decrease, Mind Spells, Paralysis, Poison, Sneak Attack, and Knockdown. It also has a damage resistance of 30/+2.<br><br>That would be an original build since just about no-one except me , would play that many levels of SD. Play like an archer and let your pet meat shield.<br><br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

If you got the specs on the build, then it would definately be something i would look into <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I would just say that it is more the playstyle for myself to have a character that does everything on its own. <br><br>I know you're quite good with rougish builds syrath so if you had a suggestion on a build maxing his abilities with rogue/sd/mybe assassin, then it would a be a great help.

2 problems with Rogue/SD/Assassin. If you want the epic shadowlord meat shield its best with a lot of levels.

Looks very good to me.<br><br>What would you suggest if you only had the criteria of getting good sneak attack, ED/SC5? Without assassin lvls.

BTW I should point out that ED/SC5 builds dont perform as well on low magic servers. It really depends how easy it is to hit people in the first place. Thats why I suggested the first build. Using the pet to distract and hitting with the bow. If you rely on ED/SC5 in melee and your AC is 40 and your attacker has an AB of 45 then its not so effective. If the AC is able to get to 60 (or even better more) then it starts to become worthwhile.<br><br>Low magic worlds suit offence rather than defensive builds.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!
