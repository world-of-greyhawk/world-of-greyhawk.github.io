You'd gain a feat with Ranger 10/SD 2/Assassin 28, plus 1 extra FE damage against Undead/Constructs I think <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    That would, of course, drop your sneak dice to 14 and your DC to 40.<br><br>EDIT: perhaps ESF: MS since Hide already gets +10 from Camouflage.<br><br>EDIT2: you'd obviously pick EP at Ranger10 and ESF: MS on a general feat.<br><br>IMO picking up ITWF earlier is a good idea (ie. Ranger9 earlier)<br>_________________<br>Fanget av begravelsen<br>pines vi av guds godhet<br>ingen flammer, intet hat<br>de hadde rett vi kom til Helvete... <br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.burzum.org" target="_blank">Burzum</a> - Hvis Lyset Tar Oss<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 02/03/06 17:09</span></i></p>

Nice build... got some thoughts for you.. see what you think (and forgive me if I ramble).<br><br>Keep KD and IKD, as your Death Attack will still deal Sneak damage. <br>Take Weapon Finesse at 3rd instead of WF Longbow - that way you have a half decent attack in melee and ranged earlier (ie. AB 6 in each rather than 4 in melee and 7 in longbow). It would certainly make things easier for you in those early stages.<br><br>Actual figures (missing from your original post):<br>Max HP 320 <br>Saves:<br>Fort 20<br>Will 15<br>Reflex 34<br>Skillpoints: 305<br><br>Finn makes a good suggestion with taking 10 Ranger levels. You could allow for two Discipline Dumps during Epic Levels. It would restrict your ITWF feat coming sooner, but it could be worth the wait. <br><br>Not only that you gain another Favored Enemy, and another +1 to damage, listen, spot and taunt roll to all FEs.<br><br>Alternatively you could take Epic Prowess at 40th instead (assuming you finish on Ranger 10), allowing EWF earlier , which frees up another Epic Feat (possibly Great Dexterity, Epic Will or Epic Fortitude)<br><br>Personally I'd try it as below (a few little tweaks that give it a bit more playability):<br><br>STR: 12<br>DEX: 16 (34)<br>CON: 14 (+2 adds another 40 hitpoints and +1 to Fort save)<br>WIS: 12 (+1 adds 1 to Will save and opens up 2nd level Ranger Spells)<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>01: Ranger(1): Dodge, Mobility, Favored Enemy I, {Dual Wield}<br>02: Ranger(2)<br>03: Ranger(3): Weapon Finesse<br>04: Ranger(4): DEX+1, (DEX=17)<br>05: Ranger(5): Favored Enemy II<br>06: Ranger(6): Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>07: Assassin(1)<br>08: Assassin(2): DEX+1, {Uncanny Dodge I}, (DEX=18)<br>09: Shadowdancer(1): Weapon Focus: Mace, {Hide in Plain Sight}<br>10: Shadowdancer(2): {Darkvision, Evasion}<br>11: Assassin(3)<br>12: Ranger(7): DEX+1, Knockdown, (DEX=19)<br>13: Assassin(4)<br>14: Assassin(5)<br>15: Assassin(6): Improved Knockdown<br>16: Assassin(7): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>17: Ranger(8)<br>18: Assassin(8): Blind Fight<br>19: Assassin(9)<br>20: Assassin(10): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br>21: Assassin(11): Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>22: Assassin(12)<br>23: Assassin(13)<br>24: Assassin(14): DEX+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Mace, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=23)<br>25: Assassin(15)<br>26: Assassin(16)<br>27: Ranger(9): Armor Skin, {Improved Two-Weapon Fighting}<br>28: Assassin(17): DEX+1, (DEX=24)<br>29: Assassin(18): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=25)<br>30: Assassin(19): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=26)<br>31: Assassin(20)<br>32: Assassin(21): DEX+1, (DEX=27)<br>33: Assassin(22): Great Dexterity IV, Great Dexterity V, (DEX=29)<br>34: Assassin(23)<br>35: Assassin(24)<br>36: Assassin(25): DEX+1, Great Dexterity VI, (DEX=31)<br>37: Assassin(26): Great Dexterity VII, (DEX=32)<br>38: Assassin(27)<br>39: Assassin(28): Great Dexterity VIII, (DEX=33)<br>40: Ranger(10): DEX+1, Epic Prowess, (DEX=34)<br><br>Hitpoints: 364 (increase of 44)<br>Skillpoints: 305<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/16/34<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Traps: +2, Poison: +4<br>BAB: 26<br>AB (max, naked): 42 (melee), 42 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 32/35<br>Spell Casting: Ranger(2)<br>Skills:<br>Disable Trap 41(45), Discipline 43(44), Hide 43(55), Move Silently 43(55), Search 43(45), Set Trap 31(45), Tumble 40(52), UMD 21(20)<br><br>Taking 1-6 as Ranger allows your animal companion come into being earlier, as well as giving you two 1st level Ranger spells (Ultravision, Grease, Entangle or Endure Elements would be good choices).<br>Spreading the Ranger levels out across pre-epic allow for several Discipline dumps also.<br><br>I would be tempted to drop 2 x Great Dexterity Feats, perhaps at 30 &amp; 33 for Epic Will and Epic Fort, which would improve those saves to 20 and 25 respectively, for a loss of 1 AB, 1 AC, 1 Reflex and 1 point on all Skills dependent on Dex.<br><br>On the downside you don't get ITWF until 27th level <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br>Just a few thoughts, see what you think. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 02/03/06 20:02</span></i></p>

Hrmm, I did not know you get that extra feat at lvl 10 ranger.  I like your layout Samphus.  Let me dwell on it as my main goal here was a high death attack/sneak char.

Yes, any level at which a FE can be selected by a Ranger, he can substitute a bonus feat.  If any of those levels happens to be in epic levels, he can sub in an epic bonus feat.  So, for example, you could take Ranger level 1 after character level 20, and instead of picking a FE, you could select an Epic Ranger Bonus Feat.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.
