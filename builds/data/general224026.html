If you take Necromancy as a focus, you can forget about casting True Sight from scroll or memory as that is Devination spell.

To get an Epic Spell, you only have to have epic caster levels (and the appropriate Spellcraft), you don't need the level 9 spells at all. PM 15 can select Epic Spells, but unless you've enough WIZ to support level 9 spell slots (and the INT to open them up), you can't get the Autocasting  feats.<br><br>*edit* At least, that's how I understand it to work... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 12/16/05 22:01</span></i></p>

Why not take divine shield?<br>Perhaps Sorc(5),PM(16),BG(19)? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Dunno if that's been done before..
