hi. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">       <br><br>i've got a character in mind that fits the following requirements:<br><br>- PvM melee build <br>- epic dodge<br>- improved invisibility (hello cleric / bard!) or SC V. guess taking some cleric levels (12-15 maybe) would be the best way to achieve what i am seeking. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br>- good AC<br><br>...<br><br>- and still being able to do some damage (does not to have to be 'uber' because of the denfense abilities... hope you're getting the idea) to his enemies <i>while not being forced to do it via sneak attack.</i><br><br>well, is something like this, or near to this, possible?<br>maybe something including monk levels and kamas to get lots of attacks per round with darkfire buffed weapons could work...<br>(i did some hours of investigation before posting here)<br><br>greetings<br>dusty<br><br>edit: if it is not possible, by all means, i'd be willing to give up epic dodge.. maybe. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>edit2: in that case a dex based bard/wm/rdd could do the job.

If it's a basic question it might be better if you posted here. If you feel it's something that really adds something new to the discussion about the build, please post in the build threat so the builder himself has a good chance of noticing your question/suggestion. But you <i>can</i> post either here or there, whichever you prefer.<br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a>
