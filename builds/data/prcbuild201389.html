The firestorm given by the fire domain seems to be bugged and doesn’t have a damage cap so it can do an average of 70 fire damage and 70 divine damage with it, 100 fire damage and 100 divine damage when empowered. Thanks to high WIS, spell focus feats, and the Hierophant’s spell power feats, the DC’s on this build’s spells are high, a minimum of 47 with firestorm and 51 with implosion. This build can also cast epic spells which allows it to do even more damage and it’s not bad at melee either if it runs out of spells.<br><br>You can also change one of the domains to either magic or water, both of which will give you ice storm, magic gives it at level 5, water at level 4. If you change fire domain to water and take the maximize spell feat, you’ll be able fill level 8 and 9 slots with implosion, level 7 slots with maximized ice storm, level 6 slots with empowered ice storm, level 5 slots with fire storm, and level 4 slots with ice storm. If you change destruction to water, you’ll be able to fill level 9 slots with empowered firestorm, level 7 and 8 slots with firestorm, level 6 slots with empowered ice storm, level 5 slots with flame strike, and level 4 slots with ice storm, you’ll be able to blow away more enemies and wreck more havoc than most wizards and sorcerers.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Giantevilhead on 06/26/05 04:11</span></i></p>
