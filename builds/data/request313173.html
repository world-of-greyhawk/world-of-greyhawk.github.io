Can I bump myself?<br>I really had this how I wanted it before a crash and tried to remake it from memory, but my sheet making skills have faded with lack of use, I cant really remember the leveling/feat correllation and how to use it to my advantage.  It's pretty much a twist on the Blade of the Reaper build, just to fit how I wanted it to look.<br>Any love here on getting it polished would be great.  Wanted the Overwhelming crit, as much str. as I could get, IKD, and rogue levels for UMD, Tumble, and skill points, just that last feat was killing me.  If anyone can see how to twist it to make it a little better or how to fit a worth while feat in there would be really welcome.

IDK is nowhere near as valuable as blind fight.  I assume your server disallows dev crit.  Could you post more as to the environment you will be taking this guy into? Also you might want to take assassin or monk instead of rogue.

Reason is I feel starved for pre-epic feats, while I have epic feats to burn on useless junk.

There are some inherent problems (bloody WM bonus feats...), but it still plays very nicely.  Just watch out for that will save...

That's what I'm sayin'.  You get nothin' much besides the AB increase, and that's an awful lot of levels (in epic no less), for a bit of AB.  IMO, there's a very limited window of usefulness for WMs.  Fewer than 16 and it seems a waste of investment, and greater than 19 or 22 and you're getting a lousy return in the bonus feat department.  I've played with a lot of WM variations, and almost all the ones I like are WM16 or WM19.  There are ways to make use of more WM levels (like double specialization, or Dev Crit), but I rarely go down that road from fear of pre-epic feat starvation.<br><br>@ WhiZ, looking at the wiki, it appears to be fixed, but there was at one point a bug involving O crit an, IIRC, massive critical on weapons. Now it looks like the ki crit bug remains, but ki crit is pretty useless anyways...

Yea, no Dev. Crit where I'll be taking him.  The heavy WM was indeed for the AB bonus, same with the Great STR's, basically trying to max out Base AB with the F/WM/R class combo.  Blind Fight is a great idea, but how do I fit it in?  Is it a leveling issue, or with the level spread can I not get the feat in?

Whether the WM extra AB is worth it depends entirely on the mod.  Onion Eater, getting 1 AB and 20 hp as a bonus every 3 levels seems pretty good to me...what are you hoping to get instead?  That's like getting a free Epic Prowess and Epic Toughness feat every 3 levels.

Please dont bug onion.  He isnt always in the know on things.  WM gets a bonus AB for 3 lvs, fighter gets a feat.  What feat IN EPIC are you gonna take?  Epic toughness is what!  Or some lame pre-epic feat taken in epic, which isnt always cool.   So, for a fighter, the first 3 gets you 1 feat (same as wm), the next gets you 2.  BUT you are still 2 ab down with fighter.. hmm.  NOW, IF figher allowed Gr str as an epic class feat, WO HO!  But it doesnt.  <br><br>In the end, the ONLY thing fighter has over WM is that you get a feat 2 lvls, and with this build, you dont really need more feats, BUT you can ALWAYS use more AB.  Thus, wm &gt;&gt;&gt; fighter in this case.  <br><br>And Epic toughness isnt too bad!  +20 hp &gt;&gt;&gt; nothing!  LOL  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

Yeah, they're gonna end up being some pre-epic feats in epic, which is lame, but they give the most bang for the bucks.  IMO, one of the annoying thing about building WMs is that you get this great AB, but you can't afford the feats that allow you to do more w/ that AB.  At least you have to get expertise, but you're very limited in what you can do beyond the essentials.  I am very rarely willing to burn epic feats on pre-epics, and I do consider it rather inelegant, but for a WM build, I think it's often worth it.<br><br>It's also worth noting that my real recommendation is to take more rogue levels instead of WM.  More skill dumps, more skill points, the SA icing, and the potential for IE are all tempting.<br><br>*which is not to say that more AB isn't better, as very rarely does anyone have an AB that consistently outclasses his or her opponent's AC, but you do get diminishing returns.  AB for this build is great.  It doesn't need to be ridiculously great.
