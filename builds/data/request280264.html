I started following a plan for a Monk build, but I guess I've gotten just a tad bored running back and forth through the woods and caves getting in long fist fights with bears and brawlers (...uhm.. my word).  I've gotten dissatisfied watching guys with fewer levels come up and, whether with sword or magic (or both), demolish something with a blow or two that I've been grinding away at for a while.  Don't get me wrong.  I think it's cool that I can run around in a bathrobe and come away just as unscathed as guys who are stoked to the gills on magic buffs or swathed in shiny plate...  but,  momma!  I want some of that flash and bang too!!!  Trouble is, I'm 14 or 15 levels into this thing (with my schedule, a good chunk of a weeks worth), and I just don't really want to start over.  Besides, I'm kinda attached to this guy.  I just think it would be cool to give him some early Christmas presents, of say, some extensive levels of Cleric...<br><br>So here's where I'm at.  If there is somebody who would give me guidance on this I would HUGELY appreciate it!!<br><br>Oh yeah.  I know that answers to these questions has alot to do with <br>-World specifics<br>-Magic availability<br>I've been playing on one of the BadLands servers.  That's about all I know.

why are you changing to cleric?  the way that cot version is set will give you 16 apr (if my math is right.. and keep in mind I got married this past weekend so its not very sure at this point).<br><br>imvho, dont alter the build to cleric.  COT will help you out alot more.  IF you wanted to do cleric, monk cot cleric would have been the way to go.  You are an elf with high dex, and if you stop feeding that stat now, you will be hurting later on as ac will suffer (iirc).  <br><br>The one thing you have to remember is that the stats were set for THAT build.  Changing from cleric ( a wis class) to cot (cha class) requires more than ON THE FLY adjusting.  SO, if you enjoy the character, keep him on the cot path.  Play a cleric later on (one especially designed for cleric.. if you like elf maybe  <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "192785", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif">    shameless plug!)<br><br>In all honesty though, my priest elf can be adjusted more than your build cuz the idea is to have a dexer with ED.

With such a low Strength, you are definately making your battles last a while.  Just for future reference, it would have been better  to sacrifice some Intelligence for some Strength.<br><br>Now, from a moderate Powergamer point of view, your best bet would be to take Cleric and use Kamas (as others have stated). This would allow you to cast Darkfire on them, allowing you to do some nice fire damage; off-setting your lack of strength. However, as others have also noted, this will incur an XP penalty for quite a while. If you are willing to deal with that, then that would probably be your best bet (imho).<br><br>However, if your willing, you could try using Wizard instead (no XP penalty, plus you have 14 INT). Granted, you will lose some AB and HP, so you might want to play with the build in a trainer mod to see how it goes. But here is my thought:<br><br>(using your existing levels)<br>15 Wizard 1 - Toughness<br>16 Wizard 2 - DEX 22<br>17 Wizard 3<br>18 Wizard 4 - Weapon Focus: Kama<br>19 ShadowDancer 3<br>20 ShadowDancer 4 - DEX 23<br><br>21 ShadowDancer 5 - Great Dexterity I<br>22 Wizard 5 - Extend Spell (or Empower Spell) (bonus feat)<br>23 Wizard 6<br>24 Wizard 7 - Epic Dodge, DEX 25<br>25 Wizard 8<br>26 Monk 13<br>27 Monk 14 - Epic Weapon Focus: Kama<br>28 Monk 15 - DEX 26<br>29 Monk 16<br>30 Monk 17 - Epic Prowess<br>31 Monk 18<br>32 Monk 19 - DEX 27<br>33 Monk 20 - Great Dexterity II<br>34 Monk 21<br>35 Monk 22<br>36 Monk 23 - Great Dexterity III, DEX 30<br>37 Monk 24<br>38 Monk 25 - Armor Skin (Monk bonus feat)<br>39 Monk 26 - Great Dexterity IV<br>40 Monk 27 - DEX 32<br><br>AB 40 - [BAB 24 + DEX 11 + WF 1 + EWF 2 + EP 1]<br>AC 36 - [Base 10 + DEX 11 + WIS 2 + Monk 5 + Tumble 8]<br><br>Basically you can cast Flame weapon on your Kama for 1d4+8 fire damage. It will only last 8 hours, but you should can always recast it. Also with 4 Wizard spell levels, you can cast Haste (3rd level) as will as stat buffs (either extended in the third slot or empowered in the 4th, depending on your feat choice).<br><br>I should mention that I normally eschew kamas, but in this case it is a quick remedy to your damage problems. Actually, it might have been better to go the Dual-Wield route for more APR, but with only 2 feats left pre-epic, it kinda kills that.<br><br>So basically you have an Epic Dodge, high dex build with 50% concealment and some "decent" damage from Kamas.<br><br>Anyway, I haven't tested the build, so take it with at grain of salt.<br><br>Cheers.
