The Leader of the Pack (Druid 16/Werewolf 5/Shifter 19)<br><br>I like Druid/Shifters but I don’t like adding Monk to the mix. To me Druids and Monks have pretty divergent worldviews and philosophies. Just my opinion.<br>Anyhow looking through the various new options the PRC gives me I hit upon the idea of adding Werewolf and Intuitive Attack to a Druid/Shifter. When building it I realised he could take Wolf, Dire Wolf or Manwolf form himself, take a Wolf or Dire Wolf companion, use Wolf Empathy to summon a Wolf, use Summon Creature III to add another Dire Wolf, and maybe pick up another wolf with Animal Empathy. Thus was born the Leader of the Pack. Probably one of my sillier ideas but …<br><br>Race: Human<br>Sex: Male (well he’s obviously an Alpha Male)<br>Alignment: Neutral (change to Neutral Good ASAP after taking the last level of Werewolf)<br><br>STR 10<br>DEX 10<br>CON 14<br>INT 16<br>WIS 16/32*<br>CHA 08<br>*+10 from Ability increases, +4 from GRT WIS feats and +2 from Lycanthrope<br><br>1-5: Druid (1-5) – Blind-fight (1), True Lycanthrope (1), Extend Spell (3)<br>6-10: Werewolf (1-5) – Practiced Spellcaster (Druid), Iron Will (6)*, Skill Affinity: Spot (6)*, Wolf Empathy (7)*, WF: Creature (8)*, Alertness (9)*, Knockdown (9)*, Improved Knockdown (9), WS: Creature (10)*<br>11-18: Shifter (1-8) – Intuitive Attack (12), IC: Unarmed (15), Empower Spell (18)<br>19-20: Druid (6-7) <br>21-29: Shifter (9-17) – GRT WIS I (21), Undead Shape (24), GRT WIS II (25)#, GRT WIS III (27), Outsider Shape (28)#<br>30-32: Druid (8-10) – Armour Skin (30)<br>33: Shifter (18) – Construct Shape (33)<br>34-39: Druid (11-16) – Epic Prowess (36), GRT WIS IV (39)<br>40: Shifter (19) – Dragon Shape (40)#<br>*Gets this from Werewolf.
