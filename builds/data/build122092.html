To the best of my knowledge, this build hasn't been posted before.<br><br>Let me present the Black Knight<br><br>Concept: Scythe wielding servant of darkness that takes no lip and even fewer prisoners. His standard operating procedure revolves around swinging his scythe until is nothing is left standing. Subtlety is not his strong point.<br><br>Basically, he is a monster. He does great base damage, sneak attacks, and crits hard and often due to the weapon master levels. He can also summon a 21HD Epic Vrock. I didn’t feel it was worth following the smite path because this is primarily a PvM build and not many monsters are good aligned.<br><br>Final levels are Blackguard 25 / Fighter 8 / Weapon Master 7<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>Strength 16<br>Dexterity 13<br>Constitution 14<br>Intelligence 13<br>Wisdom 8<br>Charisma 12<br><br>Level Progression is as follows:<br>Fighter x 6<br>Weapon Master x 7<br>Blackguard x 7<br>Fighter x 2<br>Blackguard x 18<br><br>All stat increases are strength.<br><br>Skills:<br>Hide 5<br>Intimidate 4<br>Discipline MAX<br>Tumble 20<br>Allocate the rest as you like. Max taunt or intimidate perhaps.<br><br>Feats:<br>1. Exotic Weapon Proficiency, Dodge, Weapon Focus Scythe<br>2. Mobility<br>3. Expertise<br>4. Spec Weapon: Scythe<br>6. Spring Attack, Whirlwind<br>9. Power Attack<br>12 Cleave<br>15 Improved Critical Scythe<br>18 Greater Cleave<br>21 Epic Weapon Focus<br>22 Epic Weapon Spec<br>24 Great Strength<br>27 Overwhelming Critical<br>28 Epic Prowess<br>30 Great Strength<br>31 Devastating Critical<br>33 Knockdown<br>34 Epic Fiend<br>36 Improved Knockdown<br>37 Toughness<br>39 Great Strength<br>40 Improved Sneak Attack<br><br>Level 40 stats<br>Max base hitpoints: 520<br>BAB: +44 / +39 / +34 / +29<br><br>Damage with a non-magical scythe<br>2-8 +19 Crits are (17-20 / x5) +4D6 from overwhelming crit<br>Sneak Attack: 9D6<br><br>Saves:<br>Fort 25<br>Ref 21<br>Will 16<br><br>In my opinion, this guy is great in combat. Hits hard, huge crits and will punish anything that is distracted. He can knockdown for sneak attacks, or summon his vrock to distract them.<br><br>What do you all think? Any ways I could improve him?<br>_________________<br>Moderation in all things, including moderation..<br><br>Edited By Urgos on 04/02/04 18:46:03

I prefer the level distribution of the Black Knight compared to the Heaven's Bane split.
