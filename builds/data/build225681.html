How about naked stats? And I don't see the HP and saves listed at all. Class levels would nice, eg.<br>21. Ranger21 - BoE<br>22. Bard1<br>23.

As Finn says we need complete naked stats. Also, skill points? It would be nice to know whether you've got enough points to make use of the bard song at least since your bard's spells are tied to CHA increasing items.<br><br>naked AB should be 49, 51 vs FE... not bad at all, especially considering that each hit is gonna hurt.<br>From your choice of FEs it seems you aimed this one for PvP, but given your saves against spellcasters you are done<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

I might recommend either using less bard (since it is all saved for epic) or using some in pre-epic to gain some tumble point dumps.  but then you become like grizz's build.  i have though about this combo before.  like i said, the only thing is putting some bard in earlier.<br><br>also, are you intending to dual wield at all, or just using a shield.  are you in heavy armour?  give us a little more info on what you tried to accomplish and why your build stands out from others.  then we can give more input.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger."

I would post naked stats but right now im lmited to the good 'ol pen n paper cuz my disk is about 30 miles away at my dad's house... Well here goes nothing:<br><br>Naked AB: 30 + 15 + 4 + 2 Bane = 51 on the Weapon of Choice, 49 using the other weapon<br><br>Armor Class in negligable. I would say it comes to<br><br>10 base<br>4 Natural<br>10 Tumble<br>-1 Dex<br>---------<br>23 AC<br><br>Its 31 if u use medium armor... but i have just noticed an oversight and if you swap another feat out (toughness?) you can get heavy armor... which i think is necessary... Maybe toss out the improved critical on the warhammer because it is negligable as is.<br><br>The armor class will be nothing to write home about and is the one downfall of the build, but with the enormous damage you throw it may be overcome... I would like to add that i just wanted to prove that it is possible to stomp a mage despite his epic warding really <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>At any rate he was primarily designed for mage killing and cleric raping because i utterly loathe those vile casters. <br><br>I wanted a fun character and i felt it was time to publically announe my evil creation.<br><br>PS- Bard song is used for 1 pt AB and no more, so 5 pts perform is all that is needed (-2 skill check charisma score). I am relying on the boost of intelligence from RDD to give me the necessary skill pts.<br><br>I worked it out to having (84 pre-epic + 4 Bard + 14 RDD + 44 Remaiming Bard / Ranger levels=146 pts) way too man pts for my skills (Discipline, Conc and Tumble = 43*3=<br>129, plenty of room for customization).<br><br>No dual wielding ,just high damage. I felt it necessary to prove a point that Devastating critical is a little over-the-top. I wanted to show you what the pain of a true devastating critical is, because the words 'Devastating Critical'  ar too out in the open. I feel that this build will have earned its place when the words 'Critical Hit' usher thoughts of devastation without screaming instant death to the person who sees them... though that may stil be the end result <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Freedom-Fighta on 01/02/06 05:06</span></i></p>

Your AC is 21 only (10 <b>+8 tumble</b> +4 natural -1 dex)<br>About skills: taunt, spellcraft, <b>UMD</b> are very useful skills that you are missing. I guess you are putting points into COnc to resist taunts so why not using that weapon yourself?<br><br>(quote)<br>At any rate he was primarily designed for mage killing and cleric raping because i utterly loathe those vile casters.(/b)<br>That's a big claim. You are just a couple of maxed IGMS/one implosion away from the bridge of death just to make an example and your saves suck.<br><br>The build looks like a fine tank, I would probably go dwarf STR 16 CON 16 DEX 10 INT 14 and get myself more skills (+86 skill points, that's two maxed out skills)and +1 AC and the dwarven boni at the cost of -1 AB, -1 DMG. AB 50 is still respectable (to say the least), as it is 38 STR, IMO. Human is viable too, -40 HP, -1 fort saves for +43 skill points and +1 feat preepic...and no xp penalty which both dwarf and half orc do get.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

I like Kail's suggestion to go Dwarf. You still have to choose 2 of Taunt, Spellcraft and UMD but you can never have it all <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  <br><br>However I'd probably pick enough UMD for the Monk boots, the Harp-thingies and Mord's scrolls. (You're still playing on AW, correct?) 25 should do it. That leaves 18 (assuming you have maxed Taunt) points to Spellcraft, which is 20 ranks modified for +4 saves vs. spells. Every little bit helps, I suppose.<br><br>Nice build nevertheless.<br>_________________<br>Surely, without war there would be no loss - hence, no mourning, no grief, no pain, no misery...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 01/02/06 14:42</span></i></p>

The damage from IGSM is still 120/ missile storm.<br><br>Footnote 2: Rods of Greater Spell Mantle can be used to stop IGMS spamming mages if only for a round or two.<br><br>Footnote 3: Evocation Mages are rare on antiworld, Death Clerics and Enchanters/ Illusionists are much more common.<br><br>In conclusion: The character is well suited for any given situation if equipped well, but may still find trouble with will-save mages. On a team-based server, however, when cooperation can help, this build may just be a very fun character to play.

I would like to note that this guild is about character builds, not about a good selection of magically enhanced items. This build seems quite fun, yes, but most of your fixes are aimed towards AW and only AW and its items/friendly casters. I hope you realize that these "fixes" aren't final. Not every world has the option of eg. stacking up saving throw boosting items up to +20 or so.<br>_________________<br>Surely, without war there would be no loss - hence, no mourning, no grief, no pain, no misery...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 01/02/06 19:21</span></i></p>

I second Finn's position. You have a good tank here with a few weaknesses. F.e. a well built barbarian with terrifying rage or a dexer sneaker with ED/SC 5 (just not to take in consideration casters once more) would give you quite a hard time. <br>Your weaknesses can be fixed with items, sure, but that's not the point. All builds have weaknesses and rightly so. There's no build which is the best in all the fields, and let me say, luckily so.<br><br>Also, almost any build with the proper equipment and a friendly and well assorted party can be successful. I still remember my first build on a PW, a badly built cleric which due to good gear (and good tactics) made wonders, despite the flaws in the build.<br><br><br>Your build is quite good at smashing skulls but you pay for it with low saves and poor versatility. Something can be improved with a different choice of starting race/stats, skill points allocation and feat selection: I suggest you try to squeeze out all that is possible from the naked build before committing to gear/outside help to solve your deficiencies.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Done and Done, I feel proud of my creeation and thanks for the varification. It truly is good to know that I have some prowess at the art of making characters.<br><br>Thank you for the feedback and I have made the changes to the initial post so that those among us who lack the gumption to follow a build are bettered.
