NO one's up to it for a few reasons.  The most important reason is this :Epic gargoyle is BUGGED!! (or atleast at one point it was, and we all left that shape).<br><br>The other thing is that the gargoyle, in my limited experience was also the worst of the shapes!<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Well, doesn't the gargoyle have 25/+7 damage reduction and 25/- piercing reduction? Or is that the part that is bugged? Might be able to work a druid/shifter/dwarven defender if not...

I know that of all of the shifter forms, Gargoyle and Harpy are the two worst forms.  That's the whole point of this chalenge.  I wanted to see how some of the clever minds out there can turn a pile of dung into a piece of art.<br><br>It's EASY to make certain builds shine.  Dev Crit, Palemaster, RDD, etc...  But trying to come up with a Gargoyle build that can be usefull is VERY hard to do.<br><br>I just thought that some of you guys were bored with the regular ho-hum builds that are tweeks upon things already out there.  Well... there are NO Epic Gargoyles out there (lol with good reason of course).<br><br>So even if you don't play a shifter all that often... you can still apply TACTICS of your other builds and try to mesh them onto a Gargoyle.<br><br>It's a hard chalenge, but that's what it's all about.

Well, I tested this (just to make sure) and I was getting damage reduction in gargoyle form. I didn't use any dwarven defender, just druid and shifter, and I was resisting attacks. Not sure if it's the right amount or not, but it was working....

DR works nicely now, both the reductuion and the resistance (stacking when they should). DwD/Barb/EDR will kick in only vs +7 or higher enchantment weapons or if it gets higher than 25 (which makes the Epic Gargoyle DR worthless at that point). Items with damage resistance stack properly with Gargoyle damage reduction.<br><br>The problem with Epic Gargoyle is that it overrides both STR and DEX, so you can't pump an AB stat and make it more offensive. CON doesn't get overridden, which is bad for a shape which already is so defensive and gifted with good DR. Gloves not merging (in any shape for the record) surely does nothing to help an unarmed shape with a lowish dmg output and AB.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/03/06 15:39</span></i></p>

Since you have 22 con early on, you could take EDR for your first 3 epic feats, but make sure to keep Epic Fortitude.  I'd shave off the an EEDR Fire and Ice, to acomodate the EEDR.<br><br>Taking 3 EDR gives you 9/- DR.  You have to ask yourself if 9/- balances out "10/- Fire, 10/- Ice, + extra Epic Feat".<br><br><br>Having a high Fort save is important.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 10/03/06 15:03</span></i></p>

Anyone considered going the divine route? Maybe a paladin-heavy build with smiting might help. As far as I know divine might/shield work when shifted, and paladins get some kind of bonus to AB on a smite, class level or something. <br><br>Or going for sneak attacks, assuming they stack, you don't need insane AB for a sneaker... There's a world of possibilities out there! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Anyway haven't got the time to post one myself at the moment, but maybe it wouldn't work anyway!

I KNOW that the Gargoyle is not a good damage dealer, nor is it the best defense selection.  The point of this CHALLENGE was to see how each person approaches the situation.  What is the quality of the lemon-aid you make with this big stinky Gargoyle Lemon? <br><br>So, the point is not to make a Vampire for fun, or to make a Dragon for the damage.  It to see how YOU can tweak a build to make it a bit better.  Even if you have not made many Shifter builds, you've probably made a ton of other great builds.  Some of those tricks/tips can be applied to a Gargoyle build (not many, but some).<br><br>Be creative!

Ok - because Weapon focus doesnt work...<br><br>Do what i said before! Drop Wep Focus for great fort if there a lots of devers around if not dont bother. Drop Imp Crit for Improved Knockdown - this means you have a slightly better chance against fear immune people.<br><br>Drop EWF for Epic Fort or for Epic energy Resist Acid or cold.<br><br>I think it would be fun to play - but it would suk pretty well untill level 40 (Would still suk then but not as much).<br><br>Some more advice for how to play - aim to fear mages first or else all of your hard work (fearing everyone!) will be dispelled <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cry.gif">  <br><br>I may actually make this build!

Improved Critical UA still caries over.<br><br>Since the fear effect is tied to the Intimidate skill, perhaps some feats to boost that would be good.<br><br>Epic Gargoyle overrides str and dex and sets them to a base 20.  That will change your AB.<br><br>If you selected I-Disarm instead of IKD, then you'd probably last longer in a fight.  If your IKD hits, then most likely your ID would have hit too, and since Gargoyle is considered unarmed, the weapon should pop into your inventory or at least hit the ground.  Once you stand toe to toe with someone who lacks his trusty longsword... you can smack him around a lot better.

yea i guess. sorry been a long time since i played on an un-nerfed Disarm server so wouldnt have thought of that. Take ESF Intimitade then instead of some feat somewhere.....

@ Freedom:  Ah, good idea. I hadn't considered that.  I have actually never tried a Smiter.  The only drawback would be that depending on environment, the Smite Good might not be of much use.  In the proper setting, however, it could prove quite beneficial (I assume).<br><br>_____________________<br><br>Well, here is version 2.  This uses Cleric instead of Blackguard.

I like the Blackguard version.  I'd probably try to sneak in the "Extra Smiting" feat in there somewhere.

@ Bromium: Yeah, I like that version better too.  Perhaps not as strong, but has better style.  Plus, you end up with an Epic Vrock to run around with and torment villagers.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>@ Kail: Ah, I didn't realize that. The shifter faq had it listed as "Natural", but he might have meant "natural from the shape" as opposed the the Type of AC.  Thanks for the clarification.
