If you're looking for a PvP champ...you'd better skip to another topic. But none the less, I really enjoy playing this character.<br><br>He's fast, he's agile, he can Hide in Plain Sight and his ability to Dodge is of Epic proportions. With Cleric Buffs he can even deal a fair amount of damage using only fists and feet. <br>His tactics in combat are fairly simple:<br>(Buff buff buff) <br>sneak, knockdown, score a few hits, knockdown, score a few hits etc etc; or<br>sneak, knockdown, harm, kill; or<br>sneak, harm, kill; or<br>Prepare Silent spells, cast silence on self, and run close to magic user, or knock him down with silence on. You are faster, he won't get away. And if something does go wrong....RUN!!<br><br>This is how I plan to level the character (lvl 18 atm)<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Any Lawful<br>Domains: Any (I chose Trickery and Magic)<br>Start with these ability scores:<br>STR 10<br>DEX 16<br>CON 10 <br>WIS 16<br>INT 14 <br>CHA 8<br><br>Increase WIS at lvl 20 and 36. Increase DEX at the other levels.<br>lvl   Class        Feats<br>1)    MONK         Dodge, Mobility<br>2)    MONK<br>3)    MONK         Weapon Finesse<br>4)    MONK    <br>5)    CLERIC       <br>6)    CLERIC       Weapon Focus Unarmed Strike<br>7)    CLERIC  <br>8     CLERIC<br>9)    MONK         Extend Spell<br>10)   MONK      <br>11)   MONK    <br>12)   MONK         Silent Spell<br>13)   ShadowDancer <br>14)   ShadowDancer <br>15)   ShadowDancer Toughness<br>16)   ShadowDancer <br>17)   CLERIC       <br>18)   CLERIC       Scribe Scroll<br>19)   CLERIC       <br>20)   CLERIC       <br>21)   ShadowDancer Great Dexterity I<br>22)   CLERIC       <br>23)   CLERIC       <br>24)   CLERIC       Great Dexterity II<br>25)   CLERIC       <br>26)   CLERIC       <br>27)   CLERIC       Great Dexterity III<br>28)   MONK         <br>29)   MONK         <br>30)   MONK         Epic Dodge<br>31)   MONK         <br>32)   MONK         <br>33)   MONK         Epic Weapon Focus Unarmed Strike<br>34)   MONK         <br>35)   MONK         <br>36)   MONK         Epic Prowess<br>37)   CLERIC       <br>38)   MONK         <br>39)   MONK         Great Dexterity IV<br>40)   MONK         <br><br>Skill Points: Max out Hide, move silent. 40 points in tumble and spellcraft.

A relatively weak melee presence, mediocre saving throws, low hp, but very versatile and sometimes lethal. With Epic Dodge, tumble and monk speed, you can leave and enter melee almost at will.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Zhoreb on 12/20/04 17:24</span></i></p>

If you have weak melee, and average saves, how does a typical battle go? I am trying to understand the role this character is supposed to have.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

I guess it's:<br>1. Hide<br>2. Knockdown you oponent<br>3. Keep attacking while he's prone<br>4. Hide when he goes up<br>5. Knockdown<br>etc.<br>And that's not a bad character, he'd kick some "uber PK" characters' asses easily when played properly.

You lose AB by taking 2 classes that gains 3/4 per lvl. take monk until lvl 19 and then continue with cleric. Much better AB then

Well, this guy might not be "uberly perfect" but I think the idea is very cool. In terms of role playing you could worship a god of thieves or something in that line. He *appears* to be well rounded - HIPS vrs. tanks, Silence vrs. mages, True seeing against rogues, ect. Yes, his ab is a little low, but this character has lots of options; melee isn't the only one. His diversity is what makes him strong. <br><br>If it was *me* personally, because I detest clerics, I would rebuild it with druid, maybe take less monk, and focus on spells a little more.

At lvl 20 you gain nothing for the cleric, resulting in a BAB of 14 at lvl 20. <br>There are 3 classes gaining 3/4 per lvl....But at level 20, the character is Monk 8 / Cleric 8 / ShadowDancer 4. This results in a BAB of 15.
