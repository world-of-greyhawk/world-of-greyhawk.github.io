The idea here is simple: a Monk with a useful SR score and decent combat prowess.<br><br>While AB is lowish by my standards (I don't like anything below 40), it is not <i>that</i> bad, especially considering the Monk attack progression. <br><br>An SR score of 54 which cannot be lowered in any way means that lvl 40 mages without SP feats will be penetrating your SR only 35% of the times and conversely one with all the SP feats will fail 35% of the time (and how many lvl 40 mages have all if any of the SP feats?). Against lesser casters, you are gonna be near to totally immune. <br><br>Uber speed is there, together with concealment, mind immunity and fist back up. The build also gets epic trap skills (disable, set and search) and UMD for added value.<br><br>AC would be significantly better in a DEX version (+7) coming together with +1 AB, but dmg output would then be a significant issue, UD would come very late and one loses a preepic feat (namely Great Fortitude for -2 Fort save). Also, 32 naked AC is not that bad, really.<br><br>The skill distribution here is ignoring Discipline, but that can be easily adjusted to one's own preference. If you wonder why I chose not to have it, it's because I use KD immunity gear with this guy.<br><br>Going unarmed is a possibility, although it means two less apr at the two highest ABs and the loss of the bracers/gloves item slot (which must be used for your "weapon") and weapon buffs (from scrolls and/or party members). It frees up 3 feats preepic and it makes possible to go either with a 14 CON and a 14 DEX (+40 HPs, +1 Fort Save, -1 Ref Save, -1 AC/Ref save and one extra epic feat from the loss of the DEX increment in favor of STR) or with a 15 STR and 14 DEX (+1 AB/dmg, -1 AC/Ref save). Personally, I prefer using kamas as the main weapon and go unarmed for backup.<br><br>Here we go, let's take a look at it:<br><br><br><br><b>******************************</b><br><br><br><br><b>Grand Master of Flowers - Monk(36), Fighter(2), Rogue(2)</b><br>Human, any lawful<br>PvM, playable 1-40<br><br><br><br><b>ABILITIES (ending)</b><br>STR: 14 (28)<br>DEX: 15 (16)<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br><br><b>BASE STATS</b><br>Hitpoints: 400<br>Skillpoints: 305<br><br>Saving Throws <br>Fortitude 25<br>Will 24<br>Reflex): 25<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2, Mind Immunity (lvl 20), Improved Evasion<br><br>BAB: 25<br>AB: 38 (melee), 36 (dual wielding), 29 (ranged)<br>AC (naked): 32 <br><br>Stunning Fist: 36/day, DC 32<br><br>SR: 54<br><br><br><b>SKILLS</b><br>Craft Traps 3(5)<br>Disable Trap 43(47)<br>Hide 43(46)<br>Move Silently 43(46)<br>Open Lock 17(20)<br>Search 40(42)<br>Set Trap 40(45)<br>Tumble 40(43)<br>UMD 36(35)<br>no points leftover<br><br><br><b>LEVELING GUIDE</b><br>01: Monk(1): Ambidexterity, Two-Weapon Fighting, {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br>02: Monk(2): {Deflect Arrows}<br>03: Monk(3): Weapon focus: Kama<br>04: Monk(4): STR+1, (STR=15)<br>05: Monk(5)<br>06: Monk(6): Blind Fight, {Knockdown, Improved Knockdown}<br>07: Monk(7)<br>08: Monk(8): STR+1, (STR=16)<br>09: Monk(9): Great Fortitude, {Improved Evasion}<br>10: Monk(10)<br>11: Monk(11)<br>12: Monk(12): STR+1, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, (STR=17)<br>13: Monk(13)<br>14: Monk(14)<br>15: Monk(15): Improved Critical: Kama<br>16: Monk(16): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>17: Monk(17)<br>18: Monk(18): Toughness<br>19: Monk(19)<br>20: Monk(20): STR+1, (STR=19)<br>21: Fighter(1): Great Strength I, Epic Weapon Focus: Kama, (STR=20)<br>22: Fighter(2): Epic Prowess<br>23: Rogue(1)<br>24: Monk(21): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=22)<br>25: Monk(22)<br>26: Monk(23)<br>27: Monk(24): Armor Skin<br>28: Monk(25): DEX+1, Improved Spell Resistance I, (DEX=16)<br>29: Monk(26)<br>30: Monk(27): Improved Spell Resistance II<br>31: Monk(28)<br>32: Monk(29): STR+1, (STR=23)<br>33: Monk(30): Great Strength III, Improved Spell Resistance III, (STR=24)<br>34: Monk(31)<br>35: Monk(32)<br>36: Monk(33): STR+1, Great Strength IV, (STR=26)<br>37: Monk(34)<br>38: Monk(35): Improved Spell Resistance IV<br>39: Monk(36): Great Strength V, (STR=27)<br>40: Rogue(2): STR+1, (STR=28)<br><br><br><br><b>******************************</b><br><br><br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><b>•</b>SR 54, untouchable by any means<br><b>•</b>Good naked AC<br><b>•</b>Mind Immunity<br><b>•</b>7 APR, 8 flurrying<br><b>•</b>Decent saves<br><b>•</b>UMD<br><b>•</b>Epic trap skills<br><b>•</b>Empty Body 2/day, 36 rounds duration each<br><b>•</b>+120% speed!<br><b>•</b>20/+1 DR<br><b>•</b>Unarmed backup, with 36 SF/day at 32 DC<br><br><br><i>Weaknesses</i><br><b>•</b>Low AB<br><b>•</b>Not enough skillpoints to get all the skills I wanted<br><b>•</b>UMD and trap skills come late though they would help a lot from the scratch (1st rogue lvl can be moved preepic at the cost of -1 AB)<br><b>•</b>Consequence of the former mainly, a little pain to lvl up solo at lower lvls.<br><br><br><br><b>******************************</b><br><br><br><br>Feedback and constructive criticism is, as usual, gladly appreciated.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 04/12/08 08:50</span></i></p>

Yeah kamas rule.<br><br>Well actually the fists are not a bad change, they deal 1d20 and allow you to take less DEX for more STR, one of the worse problems with high SR Monk is that they don't deal enough damage to breach Premonitions, and then a caster could start casting summons and you don't ever hit enough damage to break their Concentration.

Nice character, and everything I had written in this here upper part is edited away after I read your intro more thoroughly. *sigh*<br><br>Going the Dex route shouldn't be tossed aside either, since you're talking the party route. It let's you have a nice AB with a ranged weapon(for the mages damage shields). Stunning fist should be the opener vs any mage though. Nice SR build. Not totally resistant, but you keep some combat ability. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 05/16/08 16:01</span></i></p>
