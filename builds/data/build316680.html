Hello, everyone. This is actually the final version of <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "304715", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Silent Death Dealer</a>. That topic went so astray and the final build was so different from the initial one that it's just better to create a new topic for it. I have already consulted with Grim, and he gave me his consent to go ahead and post this.

The only thing I worry about is, how are you dealing damage pre-epic with no Rogue levels?

An option for the curious would be to:<br><br>Start as rogue, sprinkle 3 more rogue lvls at 7,12,17. You lose 1 AB, but you net more skills and round out the power curve somewhat. You will be striking from the shadows alot, so the AB is not such a biggie imho.<br><br>I would drop Exotic proficiency and switch to mace. Most environments have a nice selection if maces, moreso than kukri. You do more consistent dmg across the board. Anything not crit/sneak immun is toast anyway, so the extended crit range of kukri is a bit meh for me. That gives you an extra slot for improved kd in pre-epic, and opens up an epic slot.<br><br>I would drop INT to 12 and up STR to 12. Just a little more punch, and more carrying capacity. You still end up with around 290 skill points if you start with rogue at lvl 1.<br><br>Another option is also to leave rogue at 14, drop crippling strike and pick up an extra FE with ranger 25. Purely playstyle and env dependent of course. Makes your ranger spells undispellable for whatever thats worth too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> .<br>_________________<br>Workings of a Chaotic-Neutral mind:<br><br>Mind to Subconscious: Sir!

Let me explain why I did it this way:<br><br>Early on is when you face the weakest monsters, obviously, but where I play that also means the monsters with the least immunities. After lvl 20 it's pretty much impossible not to find something with at least one immunity or True Seeing. Having BoE at 21 means that when you start getting your Sneak Attack damage up, you're already equipped to deal with monsters that are immune to it through BoE (the enemies you choose are the ones which you strategically have the most trouble facing). 2d6 SA pre-epic won't do as much good as BoE at lvl 21 since most of your damage comes from your Panther before 21. The first 6 levels are the hardest, cuz you don't have it. After that your role is to generate Sneaks for your Panther to kill things.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;I would drop Exotic proficiency and switch to mace.

And being a Halfling, you NEED IT! I was thinking about moving Weapon Focus into the epics and taking KD at lvl 6 IKD at lvl 9 and IC at lvl 12, since AB isn't that much of an issue and you'll get more damage from the extra sneaks you'll give your panther than from the extra threat range.<br><br>Maces are not the best choice for this guy, since Kukris are SLASHING weapons, which is the only weapon type you can cast Blade Thirst on. The extended Threat range is for early damage also, and where I play it's not that hard to come across elemental damage enhancement, making this very worthwhile.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Another option is also to leave rogue at 14, drop crippling strike and pick up an extra FE with ranger 25.

Then go Ranger 26 for the extra Bonus Feat. However, there is little to be gained by that, since Crippling Strike and ED 3 lvls earlier will give you much more than those 2 Ranger feats. But I guess that is environment and playstyle dependant. If you did EVERYTHING that you suggested, except for the INT drop, you'd get +1 AB and +1 AC by taking EWF with the Ranger bonus feat and 2 Great Dexterities with the general feats from IKD and EWF. Your final spread would be Ranger 26 / Rogue 13 / SD 1. You'd end up with 32 DEX instead of this guy's 30, and one more Favored Enemy. I personally find that unnecessary, since I am such a fan of Crippling Strike, but if you wanna play this build and execute these changes, go right ahead <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    !<br><br>Take it EZ!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Maximillian Kane on 07/15/10 13:45</span></i></p>

I'd keep the skillpoints (INT) all the time, and as for the level split it's really preference. The differences are minor, really, all depending if you want crippling strike or not, really.<br><br>With trapping skills you could get by killing monsters you normally would have trouble with pre-epics.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again
