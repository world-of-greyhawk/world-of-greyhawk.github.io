Suggestions:<br><br>1.  Be a halfling.  -2 str, +2 con adjust to your stats.  +1 AB, +1 AC combat bonuses from Small Stature, a +1 general saving throw bonus, and +2 save bonus vs fear.<br><br>2.  Get improved knockdown.  With all those sneak dice you want to have a way to generate them mid-battle.  You can do this by taking monk to level 6 (not a bad plan, see point 3 about what you get by monk level 3) or just by changing some feats around.  <br><br>3. drop 2 fighter levels, add 2 monk levels.  This will give you monk speed, deflect arrows, and a +2 save bonus vs mind-affecting attacks.  You can take the levels pre-epic (it won't hurt your BAB if I did my maths right) and sacrifice Improved Critical, Dodge, or Improved Initiative without losing too terribly much IMO.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Why Wisdom 14? I'd suggest moving some points to Strength so you're at least at 10. Ideally 12.<br><br>I'd suggest a few more Monk levels too.

I like it. 39 AB with dual weild and flurry is at the low end, but pretty good. However, two suggestions.<br><br>First, drop Armor Skin for Epic Prowess: 34 AC is pretty high, but you could use 1 more AC more than those two points of AC you get from Armor Skin. 40 AC with flurry would be very impressive, and useful, since you could melee fairly well with Improved Invisibility.<br><br>Second, drop dodge and improved initiative for improved knockdown. Much better.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

The HPs are really too low for a dexer without ED, and the lack of ED is a  big issue. I'd go with 14 starting INT and pump CON to 14, +80 HPs and +2 For save are always handy. You get -43 skillpoints (and -1 DA DC), yes but you can easily drop one of spot or listen (I'd drop spot and keep listen). Discipline could be dropped too, with a naked AC of 36 the moment you get some decent gear your AC will be more than 20 points higher than your discipline and the latter will become useless. You need only 40 base ranks in tumble, 43 gives you nothing.<br><br>BTW, <b>where's UMD???</b> The single most powerful skill in the game is lacking when you could get it!!!<br>Spellcraft is worth considering too. How many skillpoints are you left with, btw?<br><br>I'd drop improved initiative and dodge for KD/IKD, way more useful than a bonus to initiative (that you should always win with that DEX) and +1 AC vs 1 opponent only. I'd probably drop luck of heroes to make room for called shot: KD then call shot arm/legs, then KD again at the beginning of next round...nasty! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  <br><br>Your second offhand attack is at -5 not -3.<br><br>It should be noted that the build gets an XP penalty from the moment you get Monk in.<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 03/19/08 02:57</span></i></p>
