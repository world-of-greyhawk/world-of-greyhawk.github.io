Presenting for your critical viewing:<br><br>The Sacred Exorcist. v2.0<br><br>Concept: Cleric focused exclusively on Turning, Spell Casting and Buffing themself AND a companion.<br><br>Race: Human<br>Subrace: Aasimar (if you are using CODI's CC, then this character would majorly benefit form the +2 to wis and cha that aasimar gives ).<br>Alignment: Any (I chose Neutral Good)<br><br>Stats: Start | Finish<br>str: 08 | 08<br>dex: 10 | 10<br>con: 10 | 10<br>int: 08 | 08<br>wis: 18 | 26<br>cha: 16 | 26<br><br>Skills:<br>Concentration 43<br>Spellcraft 43<br><br>Leveling: 100% Pure Cleric<br><br>Feat and Attribute increase progression:<br>1. Extra Turning<br>Spell Focus (Evocation)<br>Air Domain<br>Destruction Domain<br>3. Empower Spell<br>4. Wis +1<br>6. Zen Archery<br>8. Cha +1<br>9. Spell Penetration<br>12. Greater Spell Focus (Evocation), Cha +1<br>15. Greater Spell Penetration<br>16. Cha +1<br>18. Extend Spell<br>20. Wis +1<br>21. Great Charisma I<br>23. Great Wisdom I<br>24.

Epic Spell Penetration<br>36. Wis +1, Epic Spell Hellball<br>38. Epic Spell Focus (Evocation)<br>39. Epic Spell Greater Ruin<br>40. Cha +1<br><br>Equipment<br>Full Plate Mail<br>Tower Shield<br>Sling<br><br>Spell Memorisation:<br>Osirons:<br>Resistance x4<br>Light x2<br><br>First Level:<br>Remove Fear<br>Protection From Alignment<br><br>x2<br>Divine Favour x5<br><br>Second Level:<br>Extended Shield of Faith<br><br>x2<br>Extended Entroic Shield<br>Extended Bless x2<br>Find Traps<br>Ultravision<br>Bull's Strength<br><br>Third Level:<br>Darkfire<br>Magic Vestment x3<br>Negative Energy Protection<br><br>x2<br>Protection from Elements<br><br>x2<br><br>Fourth Level:<br>Empowered Bull's Strength<br><br>x1<br>Empowered Endurance x2<br>Empowered Eagle's<br><br>Splendour<br>Empowered Owl's Wisdom<br>Greater Magic Weapon<br>Death Ward x2<br><br>Fifth Level:<br>Extended Divine Power<br>Extended Freedom of<br><br>Movement x2<br>True Seeing x2<br>Battle Tide x2<br><br>Sixth Level:<br>Extended Spell Resistance<br><br>x2<br>Heal x3<br>Greater Sanctuary<br><br>Seventh Level:<br>Empowered Flame Strike x5<br>Resurrection<br><br>Eighth Level:<br>Extended Regenerate x2<br>Mass Heal<br>Empowered Blade Barrier x2<br>Empowered Chain Lightning<br><br>Ninth Level:<br>Implosion x3<br>Storm of Vengence x2<br><br>Epic Level:<br>Greater Ruin<br>Hellball<br><br>Main Capabilities:<br>Turning: Affects Undead, Outsiders, Constructs. I am unsure whether Sun domain helps when turning other than undead. If not, I would probably swap Sun domain for a domain that allows turning Elementals, maybe one that gives stone skin.<br><br>Generous Buffing: Lots of long lasting buffs. Most buffs last either 40 hours or 80 minutes. Best of all, it has enough buffs memorised to fully buff a melee focused companion, whether it be a henchperson or a team mate. Combine the sacred exorcist with a Kukri Master for example, and wow, what a team<br><br>Evocation Offense Has Epic Spell Penetration for busting through SR, Epic Spell Focus (Evocation) and Empowered Owl's Wisdom to ramp up the DCs. The DCs are not the maximum possible, as the character has an equal focus on Charisma and Wisdom. Has available for combat:<br>Hell Ball<br>Greater Ruin<br>Implosion x4<br>Storm of Vengence<br>Empowered Blade Barrier x3<br>Empowered Flame Strike x5<br>Hammer of the Gods<br><br>Bring Em Back From The Brink: Heal, Mass Heal, Resurrection, Raise Dead. When your friends get themselves in trouble, you'll be there to bail them out.<br><br>Caster Level: Pure level 40 caster level. Main advantages of that is penetrating SR, and making the buffs very hard to dispell (which is due to be fixed up in 1.63).<br><br>Weaknesses:<br>Hitpoints: Rather low, helped a little by Empowered Endurance, but you'll have to stay out of direct melee combat.<br><br>Combat offense: Has Zen archery, so it can plink away with a moderate attack bonus ( +36 when buffed with long lasting spells )<br><br>Update: If you cast Divine Power and Divine Favour, it gets 5 sling attacks per round (buggy divine power) at +54 / +54 / +54 / +49 / +44 .... certainly a rather nice attack bonus.. damage is a little bit low, 1d4 +7 magic. I really do think that strength bonus should be applied to slings... oh well :/<br><br><br><br>Commentary:<br>Place this character in a party with a melee focused character and it will work brilliantly. Can buff the melee up really well, keep them both well healed and safe from magic (SR 52 from Extended Spell Resistance).<br><br>I'm still testing the extent of it's turning capabilities, I'll post an update with what it can / can't turn.<br><br>I'd love some opinions about sun vs elemental domains... expanding the turning to Elementals is tempting, but I suppose it really depends on how common they are....<br><br>Progress Report:<br>Rakasha insta killed by Turning<br>Can't turn Dracoliches<br>Mithral and Adamantine golems took like 80 - 100 damage from each turning. Which probably makes it one of the best golem killers around... as long as you have someone else you can distract the golems from pounding you into mush.<br><br>Edited By Torias on 04/03/04 10:56:30<br>     <br>Bwookie<br>Game Owner<br>NWN<br>NWN: SoU<br>NWN: HotU<br>SW: KotOR PC<br><br><br>Joined: 23 Jun 2003 	Posted: Saturday, 03 April 2004 07:03AM<br>I'd sub sun for air.

That means that you can only EVER instantly destroy a creature with 22 hit dice or less. any more than that and you can only turn it, up to a maximum of 44 hit dice if you got a really good roll AND had a reall high charisma mod.<br><br>Now, Good or Evil domain allows you to turn outsides.<br><br>Planar Turning the feat allows you to turn outsiders AND halves the amount of spell resistance that is used for turn resistance.<br><br>there is NO BENEFIT from having good or evil domain if you have Planar Turning.<br><br>Now, I'm not really sure if Sun domain or Air domain is better...<br><br>sun does make the turning more reliable, but air domain expands it's utility dramatically AND provides a nifty attacking spell which suits the character perfectly.
