I wanna know what the highest possible DC is for a monks stunning fist.<br><br>I know you can get stunning fist without being a monk but I like that monk gives the feats and stun fist for free. Plus you get 1 stun fist per day per lvl, can't really beat that.

Well, the DC is 10 + 0.5*level + WIS modifier + 20 with ISF X, so a level 40 with 50 WIS (I think that's the max, you start with 18, add 10, add Great Wisdom X and +12 capped bonus) would get 70, however, I want to see how bad your AB is. It's also impossible to get ISF X and Great Wisdom X at the same time, those are too many feats, so the max is below 70.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "238749", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>This</a> is my best Stunning Fist build, the high DC version (which is actually weaker than the low DC version) gets a buffed DC of 61, which should suffice your needs. If you change Dragon Shape for Improved Stunning Fist IX and max WIS with items this build gets 65 but a much lower AB. Given my build already exploits CoT's bonus feats, I don't think there's space to increase it any further than 65.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 08/13/09 02:42</span></i></p>

Maybe WIS won't cap at 50 but something less because of high dex requirements to qualify for ISF. Again, considering the high Dex requirement I'd go for elf/halfling.<br><br>EDIT: basically Thax's build. I see it falls slightly short of the 65 DC mark, AB is there though (counting buffs). This can be corrected by starting with 19 DEX at the cost of CHA and INT and recovering a feat slot for another ISF. There's the issue with not having enough Druid lvls though. Dropping 2 Monk lvls means 2 less SFs/day, -1 AC, -10% speed and no IKD (KD can be taken instead of one preepic feat) but will make the build 1.69 legal.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 08/13/09 16:20</span></i></p>

Dragons are usually overpowered in low magical environments, not sure if it's the case.

Druids aren't given actual immunity to knockdown, but they can't be KDed by any PC race because of the size difference. PCs are small or medium and dragons are huge.

On the server merlin and I play on, there are a bunch of damned weaponmasters running around that can knockdown a dragon.  That, however, isn't the point of the post.  He wants a monk build with high stun DC and a high AB.<br><br>I've never seen a monk build, that didn't have dragonshape from druid, that had anything resembling a good AB unless monk was put in as an afterthought for tumble dumps, extra AC, etc.  For the amount of monk you want for your build, you won't be having that high of an AB unless you use zen archery and have a lot of magical help.  This will not help you, though, since you are using fists, not a bow.  Try mixing in SD so you can HiPS and thus not need as high of an AB because you catch people flatfooted.

If one is worried about not being able to take advantage of items while focusing on AB and Stunning Fist, I do remember a build by Cinnabar Din or the Dwarflord (Rogue/Fighter/SD) that had a very nice SF DC, Epic Dodge, HipS, UMD, Set Traps, the works. It was one nasty little knee-bitter, it was.
