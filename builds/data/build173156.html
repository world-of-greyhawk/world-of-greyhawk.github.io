Im still new to build ideas, and this one may seem pretty simple, but is still quite effective. I'm being vague as to what feats and where to distribute skill points, as this is rather a post to help make the build better, than to post it a an Epic Build.<br><br>Race: Halfling<br>Starting Stats;<br>Str: 8<br>Dex: 20<br>Con: 10<br>Wiz: 8<br>Int: 12<br>Cha: 14<br><br>Final stats;<br>Str: 8<br>Dex: 34<br>Con: 10<br>Wiz: 8<br>Int: 12<br>Cha: 14<br><br>Naked AC of 32 (36 with Bard Song)<br>+46/+41/+36/+31 With 1 Mundane Kukri Equipped<br>315 HP without reroll.<br>Tasty Bard song, Curse song and Taunt, not too shabby.<br><br>First 20 levels take Fighter<br>Post-epic, take 15 levels of Bard, followed by 4 more levels of Fighter, and a final Bard level at 40 to maximise Tumble, UMD, and any other skills you may choose.<br><br>Feats are totally upto you, but I went for duel-wielding Kukri's, so if thats your choice, make sure you have those 3 feats you need left over.<br><br>You will obviously need the 25 levels in Perform for the maximised Bard song, but other than that it's upto you. I'd suggest Discipline, UMD, Tumble, and possibly Taunt.<br><br>Im aware of how vague this is, but I would be very happy with any input you guys can give - maybe option in taking those levels - maybe a third class instead of taking the 24 Fighter? Thanks again.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 20:35</span></i></p>

Race: Halfling<br>Starting Stats;<br>Str: 8 (change this to 10)<br>Dex: 20 (change this to 18, it'll save you 6 points)<br>Con: 10 (change this to 12)<br>Wiz: 8<br>Int: 12 (change this to 14)<br>Cha: 14<br><br>Final stats;<br>Str: 10<br>Dex: 30<br>Con: 12<br>Wiz: 8<br>Int: 14<br>Cha: 14<br><br>The only change I'd make in the leveling is 14 pre-Epic fighter levels, then 7 Weapon Master levels (the increased multiplier is worth it in my opinion). You could finish the same way, with 15 bard levels, 3 more fighter levels, then the final Bard Level. <br><br>This way you'd be a bit tougher with your Kurkis, and you'd have 40 more skill points to spend. I believe you'd only sacrifice 2 AC this way.

Keep in mind that your spell DC won't be all that great.  Tactical rather than offensive spells would be good.  Buffs, invisiblity, healing, summons, or whatever.  Spells like Balagam's Iron Horn would also be good (it does a strength check rather than a save, so it can be effective against certain types of opponents even at higher levels)<br>_________________<br>Disarm?  That means chopping the other guy's arms off, right?

Why not go 20 bard?  this way you get maxed bard song and lasting inspiration. Lasting inspiration makes your bard song last 100 rounds.  Curse song also lasts 100 rounds.  <br><br>That means you and your party get +2 ab, +3 damage, +28 hps, +5 ac, and +8 skill points essentially forever.  you can use your remaining 19 songs to curse your enemies, doing the reverse to them (most importantly, -5 ac)<br><br>if you're sticking with wm for the third class. you could do something like bard 20/fighter 13/wm 7.  Take 1 bard, 12 fighter and 7 wm pre-epic.  Then 19 bard and pick up lasting inspiration at lvl 39. finish it off with a fighter level.  you lose 1 pt of bab for taking that one bard level pre-epic, but you need to do it so you can get lasting inspiration on a feat level.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By jjjhhhlll on 01/05/05 02:05</span></i></p>

I like your ideas jjjhhhlll, but I made this char keeping vP in mind to be honest - and the bard songs i had seemed to suffice most fights - but i suppose for more of a party player that would be a good route to take
