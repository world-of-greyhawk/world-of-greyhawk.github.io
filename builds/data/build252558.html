Got a couple of questions for you...<br><br>What skills did you take?<br>Why Expertise? More AC while casting?<br><br>I think you should take your DwD level earlier in your progression. Switch your feats around slighty and you should be able to take it at 11th level.<br><br>Have you considered using more Cleric or DwD levels pre-epic and use those CoT (or CoM) bonus feats as epic feats.<br><br>Also, if your taking any Spellcraft ranks I'd do a skill dump late in your career. If not, then it doesn't matter.

Right, thanks for the reply.<br>First off on skills. I took Discipline, Concentration, Spot and Listen. The latter two in particular are completely optional. Just a personal preferance.<br><br>As for the Expertise question, this build is definitely not made for casting. Just some people like to use Imp. Expertise whilst fighting, maybe when hits are only on a 20 anyway (especially in PvP), or when potion spamming <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> . As I said, Disarm/Imp. Disarm might be a better choice for PvP. I think maybe Imp. Disarm wouldn't be so wise to pick on PvM, seeing as in most cases the only thing worth disarming is a boss, often immune to it anyway.<br><br>Fair point about the epic CoT bonus feats, and yes I have considered it. But, IMHO, the pre-epic feats taken with CoT are well worth it, and of course, while there are some good epic feats that can be taken as bonus feats, I see it as more worthwhile to get the pre-epic feats A.S.A.P, e.g. via CoT. Again, entirely a matter of opinion. <br><br>Because of this levelling, DwD and extra Cleric are postponed. Like the idea about earlier DwD. On the server I'm playing with this guy atm I have opted to swap the positions of epic DwD/Cleric. I did this because the DR is very handy while levelling, and heal potions are available. Of course, on some servers, (again particularly bearing in mind PvP) heal potions are hard to come by or are not available, hence making the Cleric Heal spell a real boon while levelling.<br><br>Spellcraft can be taken at 40, by all means, max it. Just swap the 16th Cleric level to 40 to do so. This build is quite flexible as in levelling order/featwise.<br><br>One last thing, the buffed stats weren't taking into account empowered spells such as Bull's Strength.<br><br>Enjoy.<br><br>Kurth
