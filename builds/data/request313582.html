The idea of a master pickpocket with range that could survive someone after them , although probably not need to if pickpocket was that good. Thinking something in the range department this is not a uber build just a great pick pocket with some added range perhaps. How would  that size up? A roguish assassin type? Already no , no shadowdancers almost always disallowed lets try to avoid the easy choice with that one.<br><br>Raven

Forum moderator can delete this post in my divine wisdom found that really for  a pickpocket all you can do is take two feats and add basically to any archer type build and there it is. <br><br><br>please and thank you <br>raven
