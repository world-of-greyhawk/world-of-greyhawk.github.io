Paging thru the Chac builds, i saw a lot of Sorcerer builds with just about every type of class there is, but none with SD.<br><br>Is there a reason for this or has no one thought up a <br>build with this combo. It would seem to me that a high level sorcerer with the abliity to sneak around, then suddenly appear and hit you with high power spells, then just disappear would be deadly. Throw in enough AB to at least defend him self as he disengages. With the rouge in there and UMD you could adept to any situation.<br><br>I play on a high magic server, where you can get +20 weapons, and buy buffs thru the temple increasing your stats by +12. Lots of magic gear available, as well as a socket system and crafting system. <br><br>Here is the challenge come up with a chac that has a fair AB, Decent AC, Hips,high power spells. With MS and hide skills as well as UMD and tumble.<br><br><i>It's rogue, damnit, R-O-G-U-E     <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> </i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 06/04/08 18:17</span></i></p>

Ehm... Rogue, not rouge <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>I have a reason in my mind to explain why you don't see builds wit a Sor/SD combo.<br>Because casters don't want to appear in the middle of the battlefield.<br>They usually prefere some good space between them and any opponent.<br>And I can't blame them, with a 1d4 HP.

To get the massive amount of skill points from a high INT in combination with the Rogues skill points per level.

As Galebriel noted, I think it's because people would rather use Wizard for that combo. Several reasons for this include:<br><br>- WIZ is favored for two races, making it easier to multiclass with a wider choice of races.<br>- WIZ uses INT for casting, making it a better synergy than SOR for the skill-based Rogue.<br>- SD requires two feats (Dodge and Mobility) as prereqs, and the Wizard's bonus feats allow you to take those feats and not worry about being short changed on metamagic feats as well.<br>- Sorcerer spellcasting is already a level behind WIZ and multiclassing just exacerbates the issue.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
