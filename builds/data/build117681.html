I am shocked, simply appauled! The lack of Dwarven Builds here is simply... UPSETTING! You will find no better fighter than a Dwarf, which is why I've decided to add my long time and well tested build, the Defending Berserker (Working title, it sucks but I'm too lazy to think of something else). However, this build requires a lot of alignment manipulation, but anything is possible. To get the best mix of saves, you have to be willing to spend time changing alignment.<br><br>Dwarf (Male, Female, matters not)<br><br>Barbarian 18/Fighter 4/Dwarven Defender 18<br><br>Starting stats:<br>STR: 17<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 18<br>INT: 10<br>WIS: 8<br>CHA: 6<br><br>1st: Barbarian - Toughness<br>2nd: Barbarian<br>3rd: Barbarian - Exotic Weapon Proficiency<br>4th: Barbarian - Con Increase<br>5th: Fighter - Weapon Focus (Dwarven Waraxe)<br>6th: Barbarian - Dodge<br>7th: Barbarian<br>8th: Dwarven Defender - Con Increase<br>9th: Dwarven Defender - Improved Critical (Dwarven Waraxe)<br>10th: Dwarven Defender<br>11th: Dwarven Defender<br>12th: Dwarven Defender - Power Atack - Con Increase<br>13th: Dwarven Defender<br>14th: Dwarven Defender<br>15th: Dwarven Defender - Cleave<br>16th: Dwarven Defender - Con Increase<br>17th: Dwarven Defender<br>18th: Barbarian - Great Cleave<br>19th: Barbarian<br>20th: Barbarian - Str Increase<br>21st: Barbarian - Armor Skin<br>22nd: Barbarian<br>23rd: Barbarian - Epic Damage Reduction I<br>24th: Barbarian - Str Increase<br>25th: Barbarian<br>26th: Barbarian - Epic Damage Reduction II<br>27th: Barbarian<br>28th: Barbarian - Str Increase<br>29th: Barbarian - Epic Damage Reduction III<br>30th: Dwarven Defender<br>31st: Dwarven Defender<br>32nd: Dwarven Defender - Epic Weapon Focus (Dwarven Waraxe) - Str Increase<br>33rd: Fighter - Epic Prowess<br>34th: Fighter<br>35th: Fighter - Weapon Specialization (Dwarven Waraxe), Epic Weapon Specialization (Dwarven Waraxe)<br>36th: Dwarven Defender - Str Increase<br>37th: Dwarven Defender<br>38th: Dwarven Defender - Great Str I<br>39th: Dwarven Defender<br>40th: Dwarven Defender - Str Increase<br><br>Ending stats:<br>STR: 24<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 22<br>INT: 10<br>WIS: 8<br>CHA: 6<br><br>32 STR when Raging and in Defensive Stance<br>32 CON when Raging and in Defensive Stance<br><br>Add some items and the bonus Will save from the Dwarven Defender levels will make the mind spells easier to resist. When added with Rage Will bonus and Defensive Stance save bonus, saves are increased rather nicely. The Natural 27 damage Reduction of this build makes most physical attacks just pink off the skin of this dwarf. The sheer offensive and defensive power of this dwarf makes him one to be reckoned with.<br><br>I hope you enjoy this build, it's an journey to achieve but makes a very effective tank.<br>_________________<br>Did you know 1 in every 10 people are part of a statistic... freaky eh?<br>     <br>CrusaderOfGod451<br>Game Owner<br>NWN<br>NWN: SoU<br>NWN: HotU<br><br><br>Joined: 03 Jul 2002 	Posted: Wednesday, 03 March 2004 07:58PM<br>Oops, forgot skill points. D'oh! Well, really, Discipline and Taunt are the most important. Get some Tumble in there to increase AC, maybe some Spellcraft if you have extra kill points lying around to help that natural dwarven save vs spell. If this happens, you will find spells just sort of run away in fear of this dwarf. Pretty neat huh? I allow for total skill customization. I don't care what skills are used, just as long as they get what you want done.<br>_________________<br>Did you know 1 in every 10 people are part of a statistic... freaky eh?<br>     <br>Overreactman<br>Game Owner<br>NWN<br>NWN: SoU<br>NWN: HotU<br>SW: KotOR PC<br><br><br>Joined: 15 Sep 2003 	Posted: Wednesday, 03 March 2004 08:02PM<br>I like what you did, CrusaderOfGod451, but wouldn't it be easier to take the Barb levels at one time and the Defender levels at one time? Considering that the way you have it laid out you need to go in and out of Lawful three or so times. That is a bit rough on the nerves.<br>     <br>CrusaderOfGod451<br>Game Owner<br>NWN<br>NWN: SoU<br>NWN: HotU<br><br><br>Joined: 03 Jul 2002 	Posted: Wednesday, 03 March 2004 08:10PM<br>I just did it to try and get the best mix of saves and powers sooner if you are playing on a server and not just leveling up at the same time. I tested this out on a server where I Had to work from 1-40. So that's why it is that way. Feel free to change it up to make it more effecient for one time creation.<br>_________________<br>Did you know 1 in every 10 people are part of a statistic... freaky eh?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 10/12/07 20:02</span></i></p>
