I'd dual wield on a build like this.  With DP and haste both active, you'll be able to get 3 attacks on the first flurry, all of which will be sneaks.

I'd drop CC and all the DEV crit line of feats. <br><br>Honestly, I never got the purpouse of having a ton of sneak attack damage <b>and</b> dev crit all in the same build. Personally I consider even IC a disposable feature in a sneaker build especially if tight on feats.<br><br>Dual wielding and a sneaking focus would benefit more the build IMO.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!

I'd say he's a bit too easy to spot to make a vert good thief. Maybe go for dex, and raise his hide / move silently.

Sure strength is viable, however seeing as this is a thief, and seemingly focus' on several dex related skills, I'd prefer to drop strength in preference to dex with a build like this. Then using the cleric buffs to increase it (strength that is ) if I needed to. I'm used to Dev Crit not being available on most PW's, and it kind of makes the high sneak damage moot. Dual wield would also be very nice, and again, you would need some more points to dex to get Ambidex. The build could in fact remain Strength based, just slightly lower, to free up some points to raise DEX to 15. <br>.<br>.<br>edit: On a second look, you could drop strength by 3, which would keep you with Overwhelming critical, and drop the points to dex for Ambidex. Though you'd have to rework the build order I think.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Akimb0 on 11/02/06 18:18</span></i></p>

i like the build - prefere dex sneakers my self but i have a question!!!!<br><br>How come you Paralysis DC is so high (42 i think) - i always thought that death attack DC came from Intel and your Intel isnt high! Is Str a factor as well?

I'm quite sure Dev Crit will be your main killer not sneaks anyway. ( I hate the feat so much <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  ) While the skills you have picked justify the Thief title to a point, I feel that a thief that can't enter an area unseen, or escape a theft unseen wouldn't last long. Invisibility spells are a nice standby but I feel safer when hiding. With a higher Hide/MS you can attack, retreat and attack again. Invisibility spells are limited to only a few uses a day, and "see Invisibility" scrolls/spells would mean no death attacks would occur. Dual wield and Stealth don't need a fully focused Dex build, a dex of 15 would allow you to take Ambidex. the only dex related Dual wield feat, and just extra points to Hide/MS skill would be needed, rather than pumping dex to max. You would essentially remain a STR build, just without Dev Crit, which would also free up a fair few feats. Also I hate the SD class for making people think all stealth builds -must- include it. It's simply not the case. Anyway my advice is not gospel in any way shape or form, merely my personal preference from experiences on the PW's I play on. I like this build, and assassin is one of my favourite classes. Using STR instead of DEX gives this build a nice refreshing change, and I will be investigating my own STR based rogue.

Thanks for your comments Akimb0, value your opinion.<br><br>Assassins don't have many decent something else's to use for bonus feats.<br>Could take Great Dexterity instead to qualify for dual wielding feats, <br>it would come late in the build and I'm reluctant to lose Dev Crit but I like the idea.<br><br>Actually was planning to use Darkness, Ultravision combo more so than invisibility.<br>I feel Invisibility has lost it's "magic" in the game.<br>That way I can still "enter an area unseen" and attack without being seen.<br>Would be susceptible to blind fight though, stealth has that advantage.<br>I like the idea of a thief who rather than lurking in the shadows creates his own.
