Okay, so the theory is, the extra attacks granted by Divine Power and Haste are at the character's highest AB. However, I noticed something odd when testing a CLC-based build over the last day or so.<br><br>BAB was +15 by level 20, so only 3 natural attacks per round. Using a warhammer and shield for one build, and a club and shield for another. Here's the skinny on the 2 builds:<br><br><b>Build 1: CLC 26/CoT 10/Rogue 4</b><br><br>AB Buffed, unhasted, no DP: +51/+46/+41<br>AB Buffed, unhasted, with DP: +51/+46/+41/<b>+51</b><br>AB Buffed, hasted, without DP: +51/+46/+41/<b>+51</b><br>AB Buffed, hasted, with DP: +51/+46/+41/<b>+51/+46</b><br><br><b>Build 2: Cleric 40</b><br><br>AB Buffed, unhasted, no DP: +57/+52/+47<br>AB Buffed, unhasted, with DP: +57/+52/+47/<b>+57</b><br>AB Buffed, hasted, without DP: +57/+52/+47/<b>+57</b><br>AB Buffed, hasted, with DP: +57/+52/+47/<b>+57/+52</b><br><br>Note the extra attacks with both Haste and DP active. Obviously, this is not behaving the way I've always expected it would. The question is: was I incorrect in thinking the extra attacks were all at the highest AB, or has something changed in the latest patch? Anyone else notice this?<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...

My tests show me the expected results, that is two additional attacks at full AB when both hasted and divined powered. I tested it with a WIS based Cleric 26/RDD 10/Bard 4, fully buffed AB of 59, BAB 25, attack schedule <b>59, 54, 49, 59, 59</b>.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!

Odd indeed. Try emptying your override and hak folders, maybe something in there is responsible for the glitch.

What mod were you using to test it? I was using Dawnwalker's Novice to Epic blah blah blah...<br><br>Anyway, I just retested and got the same results.

Cool, thanks Kail. I PMed Grizz to see if he's noticed anything (he's playing a Cleric build on WoG right now). Hopefully others will give it a test as well. I'm going to test in the Pretty Good Character Creator as well and see if I get a different result.<br><br>One thought occurs to me: are you using a Haste item to get your Haste attack, or the spell? I used Boots of Speed only. I may whip up a build and use the spell to see if it makes a difference (don't know why it would, but as you say, this game's getting buggier by the day it seems). Won't be able to get back again for a few hours, but I'll post results when I get the opportunity.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...

Why?

Haste uses the spell script nw_s0_haste.nss, and applies an EffectHaste() to the target of the spell.  DivinePower uses the spell scripts nw_s0_divpower.nss, and uses an EffectModifyAttacks(int) command to increase the number of attacks.  Niether of these commands allows for the specification of an attack bonus modification (hence the reason the extra attack from divine power is at the max AB in the first place).  Both of the attacks should be at the max AB, if they aren't I have no idea why.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

<!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;I get normal results offline (2 extra attacks at full AB) but not online on the PW where I tested it, where the second extra attack is at full AB -5.

It is possible somebody moved something on your PW I think... just as a thought, can you test it further with Flurry of Blows? if your second extra APR (FoB) goes at -10 then it's not necesarilly the spell itself but another sort of command for extra APRs (also count to notice if it decreases -3 and -6 instead of -5 and -10, or only -5, or whatever, you know what occurs with Monk AB progression, if it does go down -3/-6 there could be something scripted there for extra APRs independetly of what gives them).<br><br>BTW, it has always been max AB for me, every single time, no matter how many ridiculous extra APR I've gotten (even with 9 BAB exploiting Divine Power) that's why I don't know how to test that change to tell you myself.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/24/06 03:31</span></i></p>

When I take a shower, sometimes I forget to use the right conditioner, and then my hair is all frizzy.
