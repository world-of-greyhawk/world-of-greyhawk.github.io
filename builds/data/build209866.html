<b>Playable from level 1 - 40...PvM Build</b><br><br>The Divine Dervish of Torm was designed to be a powerful casting cleric, who can both buff and use offensive spells effectively, as well as being able to wade into melee, slicing up his opponents when he wishes.  He has:<br><br>26 levels of cleric<br>- coupled with Epic Spell Penetration, he can handle most spell resistance<br>- coupled with high wisdom, he gets lots of spells and high DCs, especially for evocation spells due to Epic Spell Focus (evocation), the class for most of the cleric's damage spells.<br>- his buffs are also very hard to dispel...even a pure mage (well, any mage with at least 20 mage levels) would only have a 20% chance of dispelling any given buff with Mordenkainen's Disjunction.  A rogue with a scroll would only have a 5% chance.  Any lower level dispel would not work at all.<br>- Trickery domain for Improved Invisibility, War Domain for Cat's Grace and especially Aura of Vitality<br><br>6 levels of monk<br>- adds his high wisdom to his AC, as well as allowing him to get 40 ranks in tumble and +1 monk AC for another 9 AC<br>- allows him to naturally have 8 attacks per round with dual wielding, 9 with flurry, 10 with flurry and haste<br>- gets cleave, evasion, purity of body, and improved knockdown for free<br>- lets him wear monk gear<br><br>8 levels of CoT<br>- gets him to 16 BAB pre-epic for the full attack schedule<br>- additions Great Wisdoms as bonus feats<br>- +4 to all saves<br><br><br>Human, any lawful alignment<br><br>STR 14<br>DEX 15<br>CON 12<br>WIS 15 (30)<br>INT 12<br>CHA 8<br><br>1: Monk(1) - Ambidexterity, TWF<br>2: Cleric(1) - Trickery and War Domains<br>3: Cleric(2) - Weapon Focus (Kama)<br>4: Cleric(3) - +WIS(16)<br>5: Cleric(4)<br>6: Cleric(5) - Toughness<br>7: Monk(2)<br>8: Cleric(6) +WIS(17)<br>9: Cleric(7) - Spell Focus (Evocation)<br>10: Cleric(8)<br>11: CoT(1)<br>12: CoT(2) - ITWF, Spell Penetration, +WIS(18)<br>13: Monk(3)<br>14: Cleric(9)<br>15: CoT(3) - Greater Spell Focus (Evocation)<br>16: CoT(4) - Improved Critical (Kama), +WIS(19)<br>17: Monk(4)<br>18: Cleric(10) - Greater Spell Penetration<br>19: Cleric(11)<br>20: Cleric(12) - +WIS(20)<br>21: Cleric(13) - Epic Weapon Focus (Kama)<br>22: CoT(5)<br>23: CoT(6) - Armor Skin<br>24: Cleric(14) - Great WIS I (21), +WIS(22)<br>25: Cleric(15)<br>26: Cleric(16)<br>27: Monk(5) - Great WIS II (23)<br>28: Cleric(17) - +WIS(24)<br>29: Cleric(18)<br>30: Cleric(19) - Epic Spell Focus (Evocation)<br>31: Cleric(20)<br>32: CoT(7) - +WIS(25)<br>33: CoT(8) - Epic Prowess, Epic Spell Penetration<br>34: Cleric(21)<br>35: Cleric(22)<br>36: Cleric(23) - Great WIS III (26), Great WIS IV (27), +WIS(28)<br>37: Cleric(24)<br>38: Cleric(25)<br>39: Monk(6) - Maximize Spell<br>40: Cleric(26) - Great WIS V (29), +WIS(30)<br><br>Skills (190 points total)<br><br>Concentration 43<br>Discipline 42<br>Lore 22<br>Spellcraft 43<br>Tumble 40<br><br><b>Unbuffed, mundane robe and kamas</b><br>AB - 30/27/24/21/18/15 for main hand, 30/25 offhand (NOTE: according to my testing, you do <b>not</b> get monk attack progression in your offhand, even if it's a kama)<br>AB with Flurry of Blows - AB - 28/25/22/19/16/13/30 for main hand, 28/23 offhand<br>AC - 33<br>Damage - 1-6 + 2 (19-20/x2) main hand, 1-6 + 1 (19-20/x2) off hand<br>Max HP - 416<br>Saves (vs. spells) - Fortitude 31 (39), Reflex 28 (36), Will 37 (45)<br>DCs - 20 + spell level, 26 + spell level for Evocation spells, 38 for Implosion<br><br><b>Buffed, mundane robe and kamas</b><br>AB - 54/51/48/45/42/39 for main hand, 54/49 offhand<br>AB with Flurry - 52/49/46/43/40/37/54 for main hand, 52/47 for offhand<br>AC - 51<br>Damage - 2-10 + 35 (19-20/x2) main hand, 2-10 + 32 (19-20/x2) off hand<br>Max HP - 682<br>Saves (vs. spells) - Fortitude 41 (50) , Reflex 38 (47) , Will 43 (52)<br>DCs - 22 + spell level, 28 + spell level for Evocation spells, 40 for Implosion<br><br><b>Unbuffed, Boots of the Sun Soul +5, Periapt of Wisdom +5, Ring of Protection +5, Robes of the Dark Moon, mundane kamas</b><br>AB - 54/51/48/45/42/39/56 for main hand, 54/49 offhand<br>AB with Flurry - 52/49/46/43/40/37/54/54 for main hand, 52/47 for offhand<br>AC - 63<br>Damage - 2-10 + 35 (19-20/x2) main hand, 2-10 + 32 (19-20/x2) off hand<br>Max HP - 682<br>Saves (vs. spells) - Fortitude 41 (50), Reflex 38 (47), Will 46 (55)<br>DCs - 25 + spell level, 31 + spell level for Evocation spells, 43 for Implosion<br><br>Note that adding the equipment only adds some to the AC, DC, and Will save, as well as an extra attack from haste.

Steve,<br><br>Nice solid build. It's always interesting to see another Cleric/Monk/CoT variation.<br><br>It's too bad you don't have room for one more Monk level to allow you to take Monk 6 early for Improved Knockdown, then maximize Tumble late in life. But that would impact CoT levels, affecting CoT bonus feats (Great Wisdom). <br><br>An alternative would be to push for Monk 6 early, and then cross-class Tumble with Cleric late in life. But of course then you couldn't take Tumble so high and get the AC benefits.<br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br><i>"Where there is life, there is hope." - Grover</i>

i like these monk/cleric builds, but i just worry about losing AC due to hidden opponents.  Is there a good way to counteract this.  I already asked this question on kaliban's build, but i thought between the two of you i could get some interesting answers.<br>thanks<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"You cannot pass!"

You would lose a bit of casting power, wisdom, spell penetrating power, and your buffs would be a bit easier to dispel.

As you might suspect, I like this build.  I built a similar build that went cleric18/monk12/cot10 (well, that is how it ended up on the PW -- it didn't get posted here quite the same, as I believe you noted)<br><br> -_^.<br><br>Nice, nice job.

They're basically two ends of the spectrum in terms of cleric/monk/CoT builds.  Yours is a strength based, full plate wearing, great sword wielding powerful melee build which uses it's cleric spells for buffing and monk levels for some AC but mostly monk feats.  This one is a wisdom based, robes wearing, dual kama attack spammer which is meant to focus on powerful offensive spell casting capabilities with acceptable melee, and also uses monk for feats, WIS based AC, equipment, and attack schedule.  It's fun to see how you can have builds using the same classes but go in entirely different ways for different purposes/preferences.<br><br>Steve

yep.  although my build uses robes late for the increased armor class (+4 for 19 innate wisdom, + 6 for buffs/equipped wisdom, +6 for buffed/equipped dex).  <br><br>everytime i conceive of a caster build, i fall in love with the melee possibilities.  so i got that going for (against) me.<br><br>cheers.
