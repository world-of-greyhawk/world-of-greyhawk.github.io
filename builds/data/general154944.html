I'll try to post here aswell..since my post on the main site gets pushed off into the abyss by all posts.<br> My char will be a dwarf and evil, he will get two free feats, toughness and great fortitude, and +8 to stats(can max be +6 in one stat)<br>I was hoping for some proper builds with lvl up specifics.<br>I've done fighter/wm/dd, and fighter/rogue/dd the last time so i was aiming for something new, but i don't know how or what to do. This one will be used on a RP server with quite abit PvP. And hopefully i'll be able to solo some mean monsters.<br><br>PM's aren't allowed to get epic mage armor.<br><br>please help me out and post good builds that i can test out before i do this reincarnation.<br>Thanks

sorry, i was to late to just edit the post.I've looked through loads of builds. This sounds like a PG request, in some way it is also. I'm fed up by beeing beatin to moosh by other chars on the server and i wanted to hand out some payback. Dev crit isn't allowed aswell on that server, help is very appreciated.

Have you checked out my Divine Defender or Dwarven Battlemage builds yet?  I particularly like the Dwarven Battlemage; not only does he get decent HP and AB for a mage, he also gets Dev. Crit and Epic Warding, and he has access to TONS of spells if you take the Craft Wand feat. <br><br>Just put all your buffs and infrequently used spells on wands and use your spell slots to load up on damage spells.  You may want to drop Weapon Spec, take Toughness as a Fighter bonus feat, and use the extra regular feat to take Craft Wand.  <br><br>The build can be found here:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "152327", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Does your character have to be evil? I am in the process of building a monk/cot/dd on a high-magic server.<br>He's pretty fun to play. Here's what I can remember about the build:<br><br>Race - Dwarf<br>Alignment - Law Neutral (Law. Good works too)<br>Classes - 12Monk/18DD/8COT<br><br>Ability - Starting - End(lvl 40)<br>--------------------------------<br>Str       12         12<br>Dex       16         32   <br>Con       14         14<br>Wis       14         14<br>Int       14         14<br>Cha       -6         -6<br><br><br><br>Feats:<br> <br>Dual weilding kamas( WF, Imp Crit, TWF, ITWF, Ambidex)<br>WF longbow, Imp Crit Longbow (I usually give bow feats to my dex chars)<br>Dodge<br>Toughness<br>Free feats that monks get -  Cleave, Evasion, Flurry, imp evasion, KD, IKD, immune to poison  &amp; disease, deflect arrows, SR=22<br>Great Dex VI<br><br>Pros:<br><br>Decent ab, ac and saves (Will try and post the exact figures once I get out of work)<br><br>Damage reduction of 12 from DD levels.<br><br>Cons:<br><br>Cant use divine wrath, lay on hands<br>As you can see, I took the CoT class for the feats and saves.<br><br>My char building skills arent very good. So, any and all criticism is welcome. Just dont be too harsh on me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br><br>-Junkie615
