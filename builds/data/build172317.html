This is my first attempt at an Epic Build, and this build is a variation on another AA build that combined Monk/Wizard/AA but focused instead on Dexterity.

Nice build, now here are some thoughts for you:<br><br>Why are you taking the WM line of feats (Expertise, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack)? I don't see how those could be useful in this build - especially Whirlwind Attack. You mention you can go hand-to-hand but I would think that was as a last resort, and so no feats should be used towards that goal. Those feats appear to take away from your archery effectiveness. Instead of WM pre-qualifying feats, you could take Epic Constitution to increase your HP's for instance.<br><br>Wizard levels - rather than three or four, why not take only two Wizard levels? 2 Wiz, 9 Monk levels, and 29 AA levels? What does one or two more wizard levels get you that is better than the extra Attack Scores from the Archer levels? You could take the first wizard level to qualify for AA, and then take the second level at character level 38-40 to max Spellcraft. Then take your last Monk level in there too to max Tumble and Discipline (if you have enough skill points).<br><br>Just some thoughts.<br><br>Thanks for posting.<br><br>Kaliban

If you lower your Widom by one to start with, you could have:<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>STR- 10<br>DEX- 14<br>CON- 11 (12)<br>WIS- 17 (26)<br>INT- 14<br>CHA- 8<br><br>OR:<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>STR- 12<br>DEX- 14<br>CON- 12<br>WIS- 16 (26)<br>INT- 14<br>CHA- 8<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By realm of shadow on 12/27/04 04:17</span></i></p>

And the initial increase of intellegence would net you 23 more skill points.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By realm of shadow on 12/27/04 10:32</span></i></p>
