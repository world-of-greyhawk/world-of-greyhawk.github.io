Not only the master of the longbow, the Battle Elf can also effectivly wield a rapier as needed, gaining mastery over both weapons allows the Battle Elf to strike at the opponents critical points.<br><br><b>Battle Elf</b><br>Elf Bard 11/WM 7/AA 22<br><br><b>Attributes</b><br>Str	14	<br>Dex	16	(30)<br>Con	12	<br>Wis	8	<br>Int	14	<br>Chr	14	<br><br><b>Level Progression</b><br>1	Bard	Point Blank Shot<br>2	Bard	<br>3	Bard	Weap Focus (Longbow)<br>4	Bard	<br>5	Bard	<br>6	Bard	Dodge<br>7	Bard	<br>8	Bard	<br>9	AA	Mobility<br>10	AA	<br>11	AA	<br>12	AA	Spring Attack<br>13	AA	<br>14	AA	<br>15	AA	Expertise<br>16	AA	<br>17	AA	<br>18	AA	Whirlwind<br>19	Bard	<br>20	Bard	<br>21	AA	Weap Focus (Rapier)<br>22	WM	<br>23	WM	<br>24	WM	Weapon Finesse<br>25	WM	<br>26	WM	<br>27	WM	Imp Critical (Rapier)<br>28	WM	<br>29	AA	<br>30	AA	Epic Weap Focus (Rapier)<br>31	AA	Greater Dex I<br>32	AA	<br>33	AA	Greater Dex II<br>34	AA	<br>35	AA	Greater Dex III<br>36	AA	Armor Skin<br>37	AA	<br>38	AA	<br>39	AA	Toughness, Greater Dex IV<br>40	Bard	<br><br>All attrib bonus goto dex<br><br>@40 (naked and normal weapons)<br>BAB	27<br>AB(Rapier)	41<br>AB(Longbow)	49<br>AC	30<br><br><b>Spells</b><br>War Cry, Wounding Wispers, Haste, Bull's Strength, Cat's Grace, Improved Invisibility, Protection from Alignment, Grease<br>		<br><b>Skills</b><br>Tumble 40<br>Spellcraft 43<br>Discipline 43<br>Spot 42<br>UMD 30<br>Lore 20<br>Perform 18<br>Intimidate 4<br><br><b>Pros</b><br>- More than 50% of Melee Attacks (Keen Rapier) are criticals (@ x3)<br>- High UMD/Lore allows use of almost all equipment and spell scrolls in game<br>- Good HP (Max:392)<br>- Level 4 Bard Spells<br>- Can use bow in melee<br>- Discipline<br>- Bard Song<br><br><b>Cons</b><br>- Reaches melee potential late (Weap Finesse lvl 24)<br>- Low melee damage output (problem aganist critical immunes)<br>- All attacks (melee and range) are piercing<br>- No Called Shot to decreases AB of attacker<br>- Lots of 'normal' feats<br>- No Dev Critical<br><br><b>Equipment</b><br>- Keen Rapiers (critical range)<br>- Mighty Bows<br>- Monk Robes and Boots (AC and Dex)<br>- Strength Belt (Str - More Melee Dmg and Mighty Bows)<br><br>Suprisingly playable from lvl 1 (though you start off manily as archer).

I'm not sure how you are getting that more than 50% of your attacks will be criticals, but other than that it looks ok. I'm not a big fan of mixing weapon master with arcane archer though. To many wasted feats. Only thing that really is missing is rapid shot.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Emrill on 07/23/04 22:48</span></i></p>

[Hardcore PvP PoV]<br>Scrap WM, and go monk, this build is pretty solid, but your lacking in 2 departments, DISCIPLINE. 1- You will NOT be holding your bow for long if a melee character catches you, and your skills in using a rapier will be crap considering all most everyone uses rapiers for their high crit ranges. 2- Taking out creatures and lowbies is what this build is really good for. <br>Another benefit of monk is the ability to get monk speed making you faster than most melee characters unless they're a monk too, but monk levels give you the mafia appearance, due to the drive bys, but going monk allows you to swap your bow for gloves which can't be disarmed. <br><br>I know this build is different and most peepz are lookin for completely wild and orginal ideas, but like other guy said, the feats are being wasted as you wont be using most of them any way.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Ryouko_ on 07/24/04 04:05</span></i></p>

About the 50%<br><br>rapiers 18-20<br>add keen 15-20<br>add imp crit 12-20<br>and the weapon master feat 10-20<br>(i think this is about right)<br><br>10-20 is 55% even 12-20 is 45% so half of rapier hits will be critical...<br><br><br>as for monk instead of WM i do gain some benifits (including KD/IKD) but the melee is for finishing of creatures...<br><br>i will look into monk lvls and see what happens<br><br>and yes there are lots of wasted feats (expertise doesnt work with bows!)<br><br>as for feats i would have liked called shot is probably the first one, rapid shot is nice but decreasing a persons ab(arm) or dodge ac(leg) is hard to pass up<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/other/data/1071619119750.shtml" target="_blank">Neverwinter Grimoire v2.01</a>
