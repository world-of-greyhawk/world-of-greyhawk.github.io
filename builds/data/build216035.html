After a few disastrous Cleric builds I made going with the flow, finally I decided it was time to actually write one down and test it before I play it.

However, I would not recommend that due to the low Dexterity and Strength; I use sling so I don’t have to waste a feat for a ranged weapon, and to make a use of the high wisdom. You could also replace one cleric lvl with another SD lvl to get Uncany Dodge I, and Darkvision if you want.<br>I put 14 inteligence as it gives me more skill points, so I was able to max the ones I realy needed and have just a litle bit left over to put in Lore and Open Lock. I also chose 13 lvls of monk because monks get spell resistance at lvl 12 which I find to be very usefull on the (PvP)server I play; the 13 lvl of monk I had to take at lvl 37 so I can max Tumble, Hide, and Move Silently.I also took the lvls in the order I did so the build can somewhat mature at lvl 27, since by my oppinion is when things start get "interesting" on the server I play.  <br>This character is not meant to "nuke", but to be able to sneak out and heal and raise the fallen buddies, it is not an offensive character. I took the Shadow Dancer lvl purely for the HIPS, I am not worried realy about the AB since I won't be attacking most of the time, which is the reason I did not put so much in Dex, since Wis gives me more spell slots I would definately need for heals and buffs, and also took Zen Archery to make use of all that wisdom. There is also one feat left free that if you would like can use to take dex or wisdom and replace Epic Toughness with also dex or wis so u can end up with even number on the ability bonus.<br>The Healing and Travel domain were my original choise, but then I changed the Healing for Trickery because I took silent spell which also alows me to use spell slots from the next lvl, if I want to fill those up with heals, and because I thought it would be useful for the Party if I was able to cast Improved Invisibility.<br>But in my oppinion the Domains are realy a matter of personal preference, so you can pick anything u want <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Dragonlady<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 10/13/05 20:05</span></i></p>

It's very difficult to read, you have posted much stats and some valid suggestions after. A little tip on writing up your build. Post your final skills, mention if some is needed as prereq, and if some are x-classed. But take the skill allocation out of the leveling guide. If you do that, you improve readability by a ton and a half.

I echo those remarks 100%. I actually looked at your post but was too lazy to squint and read it at the time.<br><br>I would also suggest putting each class level on the line, like this:<br><br>1 Cleric 1 Dodge, Mobility<br>2 Cleric 2<br>3 Cleric 3 Silent Spell<br><br>Since I don't want my post to be only a complaint about the format, I'll make a suggestion to you: Take Monk 1 at character level 2. This permits you to put Tumble at 5 for 1 AC boost, as well as providing the useful monk feat Cleave.<br><br>Then sprinkle in your Monk levels every 5 levels (7, 12, 17) to bump your Tumble by 5.<br><br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br>What I'm reading now:<br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0874779405/103-5804382-8859066?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance" target="_blank">The White Spider</a> by Heinrich Harrer.

I won't echo format complaints, especially because I'm guilty of the sin of never posting my ending skills too.<br><br>However... I'm not sure what your 13th monk level brings to the build, especially because you aren't taking it at level 40 for a completely maxed discipline and tumble.  Given that, you might want to consider taking only 12 monk levels, and then adding a 2nd Shadowdancer level in order to get Darkvision and Uncanny Dodge.<br><br>Another thing is that some of the best cleric buffs only apply to melee weapons, and while you can use summons as tanks in this build, in practice it's hard to stay out of melee when soloing.  You'd be wise to carry around a kama, even if you prefer to use ranged attacks.  Divine power will make up for your low strength, so there's no need to pick weapon finesse.<br><br>I'd suggest taking your last monk level at 39 or 40, in order to max out your discipline and tumble skills.<br><br>For feats... I suggest you drop spring attack, you have tumble as a class skill.  Also drop point blank shot - you can melee with your buffs.  Swap Hellball for Greater Ruin.  Greater Ruin goes through spell resistance, hellball doesn't.  <br><br>Take the spell penetration feats with the feats that frees up - 26 caster levels +6 from epic penetration will let you overcome 32 SR with your offensive spells, letting you cast offensively with no failure against the vast majority of targets.  Your save DCs with 28 wisdom will be mediocre but two great offense spells - harm and word of faith - are no-save.<br><br>Hope this helps <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
