Is this an RP build (or perhaps you just have the anti-Monk virus like me) you could go Druid 24/ Shifter 10/CoT 6... although, you couldn't get Undead Shape(if I'm wrong someone will tell me...I'm not the authority on Shifters) but you'll get 2 more feats this way since Druids get Epic Feats at 4 level increments instead of 3. I have no idea what the focus on your character is (what is going to makeit unique) but I'd suggest going away from the Scitmar (I'm working on a build... I'm always working on a build I'll never post... that will (hopefully) utilizethe Manticore's Spike Monster Spell).<br><br>Find the True Soul of this Druid (what form willhe use most) and then build him around that.<br><br>Laterz

I appreciate all comments regarding this build....i should have stated that this was for a Role play and that i was looking for more of a Druid class only, but thought that it might be useless after the 26th level as the druid does not get anymore extra spells. <br><br>I am also restricted to the druid weapons. <br><br>As for the skills, i used what i could.. I could have taken Open lock, disable trap, appraise, lore and used them in the other stats, but i thought on this role play server it may be good to have.

After 20, spellcasting classes are all about SR and reaching 26 (undispellable by greater dispel).  Druids have some nice offensive spells in their kit, so it can be worth it for SR, but usually you see druid builds pushing for loads of bonus Wisdom to grab dragon fast (which doesn't require shifter).  <br><br>It's hard to critique an RP build.  There's loads of ways to make it tighter - I'd drop quicken entirely unless your on a very low magic world.  But it's hard to say without knowing more about the environment he's playing in.

An RP build... YAY!!! (All of Nature's Servants rejoices). I prefer RP builds...kay... a few more suggestions then.<br><br>1. I'd go Druid 26/ CoT 14 (or Druid 26/ CoT 13/ Monk 1 if you wantedto go the cheesy, dirtier, rotten, underhaned, (it just keeps going...) route.) Reasons, you get more feats and could boost your Wis up through the 30s easy. Then if you wanted to... if it's part ofyour character's nature, you could get Dragon Shpae a much better Form than Undead andit'll last longer, 26 hours comparedto a 14 hour Risen Lord. Also, you'll get more BAB and combined with Zen Archery you could be one tough Slingsta (slang term for Sling user... for those that don't know... now ya know). Moreso, by going Druid 16/CoT 4 (you'd need to take a Melee weapon feat so I guess Scitmar might be a favorable chose) you'd have 4 attacks per round. The greatest thing about going this route... CREEPING DOOM (it's my favorite spell... even if it doesn't like to act right sometimes in some worlds). By taking more WIS you'll get more spells... more spells... more Insects. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> . I hope this helps you find what you are looking for.<br><br>Laterz

Undead shape is available with just 10 Shifter lvls, just get the 10th lvl on a regular feat lvl.<br><br>Getting some other shapes in and pumping WIS would benefit the build a lot, without taking anything away from the RP side. Monk would cheese it up nicely, 1 lvl is enough to greatly improve it. Druid 25/Shifter 14/Monk 1 would work out nicely, for example.<br><br>I'd drop dodge, mobility, WF, IC, Quicken Spell preepic and choose instead from Extend spell, blind fight, KD/IKD, expertise/IE, Disarm/ID, Zen Archery.<br><br>In epic I'd drop Autoquicken I-II, EWF, Spring Attack, Hellball, Still Spell and maybe even Maximize Spell. EP, Great WIS and Epic shapes are a better choice. <br><br>I'd revise your starting stats also, WIS 17-18, INT 14, CHA 8 the rest more or less equally distributed between STR, DEX and CON. Pump WIS all the way.<br><br>Skills can be selected better, you are missing Tumble there.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Wait for me Dragon, we'll meet in the sky<br>By fire and magic, I'm sworn<br>Hell is calling, we cannot be denied<br>Fly to the blackness of the Storm<br><br>We must die to be reborn!

I would suggest Druid 26, Shifter 13 and monk 1. Druid classes are not the best for fighting so having the choice for other shapes is your best bet. Use shifter levels of 10-12 to pick up undead, outsider and contruct shape. Aim for dragon shape at level 13 of shifter. Take extend spell and empower spell (empower bulls strength so you can cap strength with blood frenzy and aura of vitality). Start wisdom on 18. Max it out on your attribute choice and take only 2 feats for great wisdom. You will have plenty of feats to utilise that way. As this is a RP build choice what ever feats you want from the remaining feat list.

The server that I am on is a PW/action/rp mod (dragonlance server). As i stated for certain classes there are restrictions, one being weapons for that class. Another restriction that they have is whatever class i add to the character have to have 5 or more of that class, so a Druid 23, Shifter 15, 2 Monk will not do. I was hoping that I could have went with a 40th level druid however, after level 26, it is not worth it except for maybe the spell resistance. <br><br>The choices for weapons for druids are not really that good. First choice was a scimitar or the sling shot. <br><br>I also thought that having there were too many dragon builds out there and didn't really want to go that route. <br><br>Not sure how the CoT would work inside a dragonlance mod...<br><br>Kael Pendragon, you indicated to remove weapon focus, IC and EWF. Should i not have a weapon or just switch to another weapon?

The suggestion about dropping the weapon feats was related to taking more shifter epic forms (outsider, construct and dragon). You need feats slots for that (Great WIS and shapes) and it changes the way one plays the build, making the weapon feats less important. If you go that route, other feats will benefit you more than focusing on a weapon, especially considering many of your forms are in fact unarmed. Take a look at the feats I suggested and you'll understand what I mean.<br><br>You could go with 6 monk lvls and less druid, it nets you AC boost, speed boost, IKD, cleave, evasion, stunning fist (nice with high WIS), monk att progression unarmed (useful in many forms), deflect arrows and some more monk's coolness.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Wait for me Dragon, we'll meet in the sky<br>By fire and magic, I'm sworn<br>Hell is calling, we cannot be denied<br>Fly to the blackness of the Storm<br><br>We must die to be reborn!

One other suggestion since you are so tight on feats is to aim to end on bonus feat levels. Druid 26/Shifter 14 ends both on non-bonus levels, Druid 24/Shifter 16 will gain you one bonus feat.<br><br>If you want monk, I would go Druid 24/Monk 6/Shifter 10, again aiming for bonus feats.<br><br>TM

You play with me? Nice. For our server I can easily suggest monk 6/Shifter 10/Druid 24 like in the post above. There are some good Druid cloth armours around there too, and many weapons that would be fine if melded. No restrictions on weapons for a Druid that I know of, except those the engine brings. You should try to get hold of Wep prof: martial and exotic, perhaps it must be taken on monk level. That level 5 rule is a pain in the b*** IMO. Remember to keep your Druid levels on at least 20 to be able to get leader positions in the Druid guild.

HI everyone, <br><br>  While sorting this mess out again, i came out with the following however, i didn't really like the Great Fortitude, and wanted to use max spell, since these were the only two items i could thrown in pre-epic.  I ended up taking armour skin out as i really wanted to have undead shape (undead lord). <br><br>  I would of liked to have gotten the outsider shape, but that would mean getting rid of Epic Prowess, or adding to the wisdom stat at the beginning. Any other ideas???<br><br>The Forest Chameleon (Druid 22 / Shifter 12 / Monk 6)<br>Race		Human			<br>Alignment	Lawful Neutral<br><br>Starting		Ending<br>STR 	10		STR	10	<br>DEX 	12		DEX 	16	<br>CON 	13		CON	18	<br>INT	14		INT	10	<br>WIS	17		WIS	20	<br>CHA	8		CHA	12		<br><br>Leveling<br>1 	Druid (1)	Alertness, Blind fight<br>2	Druid (2)		<br>3 	Druid (3)	Weapon Focus (unarmed strike)<br>4	Druid (4)	Wisdom (18)<br>5 	Druid (5)<br>6 	Shifter (1)	Toughness<br>7 	Shifter (2)	<br>8 	Shifter (3)	Wisdom (19)<br>9 	Shifter (4)	Zen Archery<br>10	Druid (6)		<br>11 	Monk (1)<br>12 	Monk (2)	Wisdom (20), Imp.

I assume that you mean you have 30 wis and 14 con as they are the only two stats that have been risen. I would switch great fortitude and weapon focus for disarm and imp disarm or extend spell and empower spell. You can swop undead shape for outsider shape as this will be more beneficial to you. I take it that these skills are based on role playing and the server you're on. Otherwise swop appraise, heal, open lock, disable trap and lore for disicipline, hide, move silently and tumble to 40.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Jehoshua on 04/16/06 18:22</span></i></p>
