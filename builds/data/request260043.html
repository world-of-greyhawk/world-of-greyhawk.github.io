I think I've looked over just about everything both Grizzled_dwarflord and Mithradates have posted. This is a generalization but Grizz for playability and Mith for pvp.<br><br>I wouldn't limit myself if I were you. Get an idea or two of what you want in your build, then use the Character Search Engine to check builds that would fall loosly into the character classes you are looking for. There are a lot of excellent builders posting here and sometimes Grizz or Mith won't have the best version of the build you are looking for. Hmm I think I might have just said something sacraligious. I hope I don't get banned <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif"> <br><br>If you want to just search by name don't neglect the builds by Kail Pendragon, Grimnir77, Cinnabar Din, TyrTemplar, FinneousPJ, Mick Dagger, Thaxll'ssyllia, Xylophone and as of late I've been noticing strong builds from Bromium. I've left a lot of good builders out but the names I've listed have been somewhat active lately and might be more prone, or avaialble, to answer your questions.<br><br>There you go. I've committed a sacralige against the two biggest builders here, Grizzled and Mith, and I've probably upset others by leaving there names off my silly list. I think I'll stop now and hide in my cave until the dark riders have passed by <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

If you just want a dwarven Weapon Master, there is no problem, dwarf is a good race easy to fit almost anywhere, Exotic Weapon ain't a dificulty either, just take a good amount of Fighter or CoT levels, STR based, etc, etc, if you only want 2 rogue levels, Fighter10/Weapon Master28/Rogue2 will be the most obvious spread for max AB... but I'd take Bard instead of Rogue if it's only 2 levels, since it will also grant you spellcraft. Rogue could be good with a CoT spread, where the saves are higher and Evasion could get its uses, but I still prefer Bard. Knowing Grizz, he'll prefer Bard too, just check his builds, lots of Bards.

Oh yeah let's not forget Anuis /bow.... No really, I mentioned the names that I did because that group seems to post alot of builds and they are still around trolling these boards. I haven't seen too many builds from Anuis lately.<br><br>I was a lot like the OP when I first found this guild. When you are new, not sure if the OP is, the Grizzled Dwarflord's builds stand out. One of my first posts listed a bunch of builds I thought looked good and I realized latter they were mostly Grizzled's builds.<br><br>I think it is good to let anyone who comes here for the first time that there are several good builders, and that sometimes the person who builds the character closest to what you are looking for is a one-hit-wonder so to speak.<br><br>The Character Builder Search Engine is your friend <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
