<b>Playable from levels 1-24 and 36-40... PVM or PVP</b><br><br>The inspiration for this build came from Thaxll'ssyllia's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "246048", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Arcane Knight of Lathander</a>.  Basically I wanted to see if his build could be matched with sorcerer instead of wizard.  Wildeyes' <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117498", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Planar Guardian</a> has the same level distribution but is a charisma focused build.  This build does end up better than I thought it would, the main problems are the low AB and hitpoints.  Because of the cleric buffs, he can raise his AB to levels which are fine for low to mid magic play.  His hitpoints are a different matter, even with endurance and aura of vitality he'll only have slightly more than 400 hitpoints.  If he gets dispelled, which with 16 cleric levels is a distinct possibility, he has to rely on his arcane casting which isn't all that strong but should do the trick.  This build should do best in no to low magic settings where devastating critical has been banned.  It is primarily a PvM build, since getting dispelled is less likely in those environments, but it should be capable of PvP as well.  Arcane casters and clerics with over 30 levels will pose a problem, but this build should be able to hold it's own against other builds in those environments.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br>-Level 9 Sorcerer spell casting.  His DCs are low and spell resistance will prove problematic but he can fire off level 9 sorcerer spells.  With 23 levels his sorcerer buffs are hard to strip, except with a holy avenger or Mordenkainen's Disjunction.  If his buffs are stripped, he still has spells he can use to strip the buffs of an enemy caster and some offensive spells<br>-Level 8 Sorcerer spell casting.  Same problem as the Sorcerer spells. They are they mainly for the buffs but with a caster level of 16 can be easily dispelled.  Hopefully anything that dispels him can be handled by the sorcerer spells<br>-Good AC.  This build can manage a 64 AC with no magic equipment.<br>-8 attacks per round (4 at maximum AB) while buffed.  His AB is abysmal, but it can be buffed to the mid 50s which should be fine in no or low magic settings<br>-Evasion.  His reflex save isn't great, but it should still be useful.<br>-Epic Warding. 50/+20 damage reduction is always nice.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br>-Low AB.  A 32 AB at level 40 is really bad, thankfully he can get a +20 to AB with cleric buffs which will make him better than most fighters in a mid magic environment.<br>-Low Hitpoints.  With the ugly stat spread his constitution couldn't be raised by much, and with 21 levels of 1D4 hitpoints he is pretty fragile.<br>-Mediocre Saving Throws.  They are okay against spells, but low against other effects.  He does have spells that can grant him immunity to certain effects, death ward, shadow shield, mind blank, freedom of movement, protection from negatice energy, etc.<br>-Cleric buffs are easily removed.  Not much he can do, other than cast greater sanctuary and rebuff, or counter with his own magic.<br>-Matures late.  The build is not really complete until it gets the monk level at 40.  It isn't the most playable build, but it isn't unplayable either.  Other than the low hitpoints it is pretty easy to play into the low 20s, it then gets difficult to play as one waits for the arcane spell casting to improve.<br><br><b>Mystra's Devotee</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Human<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Any Lawful<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 14<br>DEX 14<br>CON 10 <br>INT 12<br>WIS 14<br>CHA 14<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>Levels 4, 8, 12, and 16 increase Wisdom<br>Levels 20, 24, 28 and 32 increase Charisma<br>Levels 36 and 40 increase Dexterity<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Cleric 16<br>Monk 1<br>Sorcerer 23<br><br><i>Clerical Domains</i><br>War and Healing<br><br><i>Level Distribution and Feats</i><br>Level 1: (Cleric 1): Toughness, Knockdown<br>Level 2: (Cleric 2)<br>Level 3: (Cleric 3): Power Attack<br>Level 4: (Cleric 4)<br>Level 5: (Cleric 5)<br>Level 6: (Cleric 6): Extend Spell<br>Level 7: (Cleric 7)<br>Level 8: (Cleric 8 )<br>Level 9: (Cleric 9): Divine Shield<br>Level 10: (Cleric 10)<br>Level 11: (Cleric 11)<br>Level 12: (Cleric 12): Weapon Proficiency (Exotic)<br>Level 13: (Cleric 13)<br>Level 14: (Cleric 14)<br>Level 15: (Cleric 15): Weapon Finesse<br>Level 16: (Cleric 16)<br>Level 17: (Sorcerer 1) <br>Level 18: (Sorcerer 2): Weapon Focus (Kama)<br>Level 19: (Sorcerer 3)<br>Level 20: (Sorcerer 4)<br>Level 21: (Sorcerer 5): Epic Weapon Focus (Kama)<br>Level 22: (Sorcerer 6)<br>Level 23: (Sorcerer 7)<br>Level 24: (Sorcerer 8 ): Epic Prowess<br>Level 25: (Sorcerer 9)<br>Level 26: (Sorcerer 10)<br>Level 27: (Sorcerer 11): Armor Skin<br>Level 28: (Sorcerer 12)<br>Level 29: (Sorcerer 13)<br>Level 30: (Sorcerer 14): Great Charisma I<br>Level 31: (Sorcerer 15)<br>Level 32: (Sorcerer 16)<br>Level 33: (Sorcerer 17): Great Charisma II<br>Level 34: (Sorcerer 18)<br>Level 35: (Sorcerer 19)<br>Level 36: (Sorcerer 20): Great Dexterity I<br>Level 37: (Sorcerer 21)<br>Level 38: (Sorcerer 22)<br>Level 39: (Sorcerer 23): Great Dexterity II, Epic Spell (Epic Warding)<br>Level 40: (Monk 1)<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 14<br>DEX 18<br>CON 10 <br>INT 12<br>WIS 18<br>CHA 20<br><br><i>AB and Damage</i><br>(no buffs, mundane kama)<br>32/29/26/23/20 2+1D6 (20 x2)<br><br>(+8 to Dexterity [Cat's Grace, Aura of Vitality], +12 to Strength [Bull's Strength, AoV, DP], Bless, Aid, Divine Favor, Battle Tide, Divine Power, Greater Magic Weapon, Dark Fire, Flame Weapon, Keen Edge, Haste, mundane Kama)<br>56/53/50/47/44/56/56 11+1D6 (19-20 x2) +7 magic +18+1D4+1D6 fire<br><br>(As above with flurry of blows)<br>54/54/51/48/45/42/54/54 11+1D6 (19-20 x2) +7 magic +18+1D4+1D6 fire<br><br>(As above with a +12 to Dexterity)<br>56/56/53/50/47/44/56/56 11+1D6 (19-20 x2) +7 magic +18+1D4+1D6 fire<br><br><i>AC</i><br>28 (no buffs, no equipment)<br>61 (+8 to Dexterity [Cat's Grace, Aura of Vitality], +4 to Wisdom [Owl's Wisdom], +4 to Charisma [Eagle's Splendor], Divine Shield, Shield of Faith, Magical Vestments, Haste, Shadow Shield, Mage Armor)<br>74 (+12 to Dexterity, +10 to Charisma, +10 to Wisdom, +5 Robes, +5 Ring of Protection, +5 Boots of the Sun Soul, Divine Shield, Haste, Mage Armor, Shadow Shield)<br><br><i>Final Saves (Vs.

His discipline won't do him any good anyway. He should see if he can spend the points in better places. A low-strength build without Bard or ESF's don't get any use for the discipline except vs smurfs spamming IKD and nail you on a 20. None of the places I have played has featured smiurfs, however. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Seriously though, the tumble dump would be worse. He should be playable enugh methinks, except for dispelling as noted. Low hitpoints are helped by his ability to heal up. And by just 1 casting of divine power after being dispelled he gets an extra attack and +7 AB. Not bad. Greater Sanctuary gets you out of a pinch too.<br><br>It should be fun to play this one, Mith, the biggest problem might be to find all the quickslots you need. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 03/06/06 18:56:45 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br>Trollborn Asgardian by the master of the Norse legends, Grimnir himself!<br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

No one ever listens to me, if you want HP, use Tenser's Transformation, yes, it's a problematic buff, as it lowers your base spellcasting score by 10 (and I think you actually lose CHA bonus prepared slots with it) but it gives 1d6 HP per caster level (aside from other cool stuff: +1 AB per every 2 caster levels, 2d4 STR and DEX, +5 Fortitude and +4 Natural AC), which means 23-138, and I'm pretty sure it can be Maximized.<br><br>Taking Monk earlier would make him either lose a feat from Sorc (Epic Warding), or spells (and spellcasting power) from Cleric, this kind of build needs lots of caster levels. Anyway, normally I'd say Exotic is worth the BAB, however, Divine Power actually makes it max, and your buffs suffice to cap AB... so it gets weird... it's a matter of not having levels to spare, or else, maybe Cleric 15 could work ok.<br><br>Those stats... ouch, low DEX for being DEX-based... and HP suffers too.<br><br>A cool thing about the Cleric/Arcane is that Trickery, Magic and Travel Domain spells are already covered.<br><br>Where's Divine Might!? it should work greatly... that's a point where taking Monk earlier could get to help...<br><br>It's nice and strong anyway... you don't get my stilling problem because you're DEX based, now that I think of it, mine could also go DEX based (idiot of me), GMW, Divine Favor, Darkfire and Flame Weapon add a lot of damage, never thought of it before... I should go right now and make anotehr version.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/15/06 00:10</span></i></p>

I built a character with the same classes and a slightly different level split with the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "220284", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Blessed Sorceress</a> - C 13 S 26 M 1.  That character is oriented towards being a spellcaster and party support character rather than a melee of any sort, but turned out quite well in normal play (though somewhat difficult to solo while making the transition from cleric to sorcerer levels).  Having two spellbooks makes for a character with a lot of flexibility and adventuring endurance.<br><br>I'd almost suggest eating the exp penalty and going with cleric 15/monk 2/sorc 23 to free the feat up from exotic proficiency since this build, like all sorcerers, is starved for feats.<br><br>Since you're splitting between three stats it's going to be hard to improve the character's AB without sacrificing magic from somewhere... I'm not sure you really need 8th level cleric spells though.  Your mileage may vary of course.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Interesting build, Mith: talk about spell access (where you gonna puts 'em all I wonder? oh, what a nice problem to have <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">   I'd be inclined to go for monk earlier (or for 2 monks though, notwithstanding the XP issue), for the reasons already suggested; as you're relying on buffs and cleric/arcane protection/buffs anyway, yes?
