The ultimate dwarven champion. dwarf that has devastating critical and the most PERMANENT damage reduction possible in the game.(I know epic warding gives more, but that tends to run out and you only get one a day.) I gave him a warhammer, to better fit the concept of the dwarven champion. To make him more devastating in combat, Give him all the weapon specific feats in scimitar instead. He is versatile in combat, with a good defense, HORRENDOUS DR and a moderate to high amount of offense.<br><br>beginning stats:<br>strength : 16<br>dexterity : 13<br>constitution : 18<br>intelligence : 13<br>wisdom : 8<br>charisma : 6<br><br>skills:<br>concentration up to 40<br>discipline up to 40<br>tumble up to 20<br>craft armor for the rest, why not?<br><br>level spread :<br>fighter 7<br>dwarven defender 10<br>fighter 3<br>dwarven defender 20<br><br>stat points :<br>raise con naturally to 24<br>raise str from then on<br><br>feats to take, in order, at level:<br>1 : dodge / toughness<br>2 : mobility<br>3 : weapon focus : warhammer<br>4 : expertise<br>6 : spring attack / weapon specialization : warhammer<br>9 : improved critical : warhammer<br>12 : whirlwind attack<br>15 : power attack<br>18 : cleave / great cleave<br>20 : blind fight<br>21 : epic damage reduction 1<br>24 : epic damage reduction 2 / great strength 1<br>27 : great strength 2<br>28 : epic damage reduction 3<br>30 : great strength 3<br>32 : armor skin<br>33 : great strength 4<br>36 : overwhealming critical : warhammer / great strength 5<br>39 : great strength 5<br>40 : devastating critical : warhammer<br><br>ending stats :<br>strength : 26<br>dexterity : 13 (full plate for him)<br>constitution : 24<br>intelligence : 13<br>wisdom : 8<br>charisma : 6<br>naked ac 17 (21 with defensive stance) (with a mundane tower shield, and mundane full plate, his usual equipment, his ac while in defensive stance is 31)<br>I got 687 hp without re-rolling, defensive stance raises that to 767.<br>ending attack bonus with favored weapon:<br>39/34/29/24 before defensive stance<br>40/35/30/25 after<br>damage with his warhammer:<br>1-8 + 10 (19-20 / x3)<br>defensive stance:<br>1-8 + 11 (19-20 / x3)<br><br>for a more twinkish build, if you replace the warhammer with a scimitar, the damage is:<br>1-6 + 10 (+11 defensive) (15-20 / x2)<br>Find a keen scimitar, and you have a crit range of (12-20 / x2). Whirlwind attack with this, and you are guaranteed to cause the devastating critical on about one out of every 2 people in range.<br>his dr by level 40 is 30/-, the maximum possible without magic.<br><br>For all of you devastating crit people, his fortitude save while in defensive stance is 33, so there is actually a chance he could make the save.<br><br>For maximum damage avoidance (no smites here....), and in keeping with the dwarven mindset, he's lawful neutral.<br>_________________<br>Save yourself some arm strain.
