Has anyone created a Dev Crit archer and tried it out? How frequently do you get Dev Crits? It seems to me that the crit range of a bow is so narrow that you wouldn't get Dev Crits that often....in which case the feats could be put to better use.<br><br>Just curious to see what experience people have had with this.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban.

Yes I've tried a Bard/RDD/AA Dev Crit build. The high AB with the AA plus the number of attacks give a reasonable return on crits. Maybe not as high as a STR based melee char, but not too shabby either.

you can also always try a crossbow, to give a 17/20 crit range, but it'll be hard to get a decent ab this way since arcane archers don't use crossbows.

I am playing a Fighter/Bard/AA with dev crit at the moment. He has a dev crit DC of 43-44 (cant remember which) and an AB of 67 with a +7 bow. I find that crits aren't that hard to get, you just have to be lucky with your dice rolls
