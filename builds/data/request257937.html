I would go Druid Shifter Assasin and take Undead Form.<br><br>You'll be able to use a Scythe, pick pockets, become invisible (+improved).  You'd be IMMUNE TO PICKPOCKET, sneak, crit, mind spells, poison...  Slash/pierce 50% Damage Immunity.<br><br>You can still boost your dex up since Risen Lord does not overide it.  Might even get Epic Dodge as a Risen Lord.<br><br>As part Druid you also get the camo spell for extra hide/ms.<br><br>Free 21 base str and 19 con.<br><br>5/10/25 means lots of Death Attack damage.<br><br>Since you are a PP at heart, it is nice that a shifted form is immune to being picked.  A good IKD will help you deal your sneak damage as well.<br><br>(fyi:  I'm partial to Shifters)

Tx for the shifter idea but the only probd i have with that build is if a cleric comes along which is quite common where i play and also im interested in some extremly High ab if it wasnt for them pesky clerics i would of given this a go the other thing i find with assasin is the death dc attack doesnt work to great although would go really nice an undead scyther with death attack   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">
