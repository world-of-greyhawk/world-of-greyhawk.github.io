On the server I play on getting to 40 isnt the only thing todo, building fun daft characters to play Is a challenge to sooo that said I want to try a Tarzan style build. What I dont wanna use is a Monk in the build.<br><br>   I was Thinking .... Fighter / Barbarian / Rogue incorperating Tumble, Hand to Hand, Knife skills (( so dagger or Kukri )) He cant wear Armour or a Helmet but I can get +3 bracers, boots, cloaks, rings, ammys etc etc really easy.. maxing upto +10 slowly, these also include Stat bonus's on them and some damage resistance. All that said I dont no where to go from here, Human / Elf ? starting stats. <br><br>   So this is a Big shout out to all you creative Character designers out there HELP ME !!!!! <br><br>   Oh last thing Class steps have to be initailly in steps of 5 I.E 1-5 Fighter then 6-10 could be Barbarian and the Last 5 Rogue after that any mixture is ok. Or the other way 1/1/1 1/2/1 etc etc etc <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">  <br><br>   Treat it as a competion everybody gets to have a GO at building him <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">
