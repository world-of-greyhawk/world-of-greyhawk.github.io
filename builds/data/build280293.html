This build was inspired by <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225913", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>His Divine Mistress</a> created by Maniac Mailman and some comments made by the Grizzled Dwarflord in that thread. Since that thread is 18 months old, I decided to start a new one to get opinions on the changes that I made. My intent was to have a solo fighter who could go it alone, without having to worry about henchmen. It seems to work pretty well, but I was wondering if there were any improvements to be made.<br><br>Champion of Torm(20), Fighter(6), Rogue(14)<br>Human<br>Alignment: Any non-evil<br>Playable 1-40: PvM (don't know about Pvp, I don't play it.)<br><br>Abilities<br>STR: 16 (30)	<br>DEX: 12	<br>CON: 16 (18)	<br>WIS: 8	<br>INT: 14	<br>CHA: 8	<br><br>Hitpoints:   544 max<br>Skillpoints: 317<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4 Traps: +3<br>BAB: 27<br>AB: (mundane Greatsword) 41/36/31/26<br>AC: (naked/Full Plate) 21/29<br><br>Skills:<br>Discipline 42(52)<br>Disable Trap 16(20)(Enough for Deadly) 	<br>Open Lock 14(15)<br>Search 16(18) (Enough for Deadly)<br>Set Trap 21(24) (Enough for Deadly)<br>Spellcraft 18(20)<br>Spot or Listen 43(42)<br>Tumble 40<br>UMD 36(35)<br>	53 points leftover for customization<br>	<br>Levelling Guide<br>1  Rogue(1): 	Luck of Heroes, Iron Will	<br>2  Fighter(1):  Weapon Focus: Greatsword	<br>3  Fighter(2):  Power Attack, Cleave	<br>4  Fighter(3):  STR+1, (STR=17)<br>5  Fighter(4):  Weapon Spec: Greatsword	<br>6  Rogue(2):    Knockdown, {Evasion}	<br>7  Rogue(3):    {Uncanny Dodge I}	<br>8  Rogue(4):    STR+1, (STR=18)	<br>9  Rogue(5):    Great Cleave	<br>10 Rogue(6)	<br>11 CoT (1)	<br>12 CoT(2): 		Improved Knockdown, Improved Critical: Greatsword, STR+1, (STR=19)	<br>13 Rogue(7)	<br>14 Rogue(8)	<br>15 Rogue(9): 	Toughness	<br>16 Rogue(10):   Crippling Strike, STR+1, (STR=20)	<br>17 CoT(3): 		{Smite Evil}	<br>18 CoT(4): 		Called Shot*, Blind Fight*	<br>19 CoT(5)	<br>20 CoT(6): 		Disarm* STR+1, (STR=21)<br>21 Fighter(5): 	Great Strength I (STR=22)<br>22 CoT(7)	<br>23 CoT(8): 		Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword	<br>24 Fighter(6):  Great Strength II, Epic Weapon Spec: Greatsword, STR+1, (STR=24) <br>25 CoT(9)	<br>26 CoT(10): 	Overwhelming Crit: Greatsword	<br>27 Rogue(11): 	Great Strength III (STR=25)	<br>28 CoT(11): 	STR+1, (STR=26)<br>29 CoT(12)	<br>30 CoT(13): 	Dev Crit: Greatsword	<br>31 CoT(14): 	Epic Prowess	<br>32 Rogue(12): 	STR+1, (STR=27)	<br>33 CoT(15): 	Great Strength IV (STR=28)<br>34 CoT(16)	<br>35 Rogue(13): 	Improved Evasion	<br>36 CoT(17):  	Great Strength V (STR=29) CON+1, (CON=17)<br>37 CoT(18): 	Armor Skin	<br>38 CoT(19)	<br>39 CoT(20): 	Great Strength VI (STR=30)<br>40 Rogue(14): 	CON+1 (CON=18)

You forgot the final overall saves, and I guess they should be decent with +10 from CoT levels. You didnt state how high sneak attack you get either but that would be 7d6.<br><br>It seems quite strong, and versatile as well due to rogue levels, although you rely on either high skill rolls or a PW where all rogue-skills have "auto-20" to save you time and trouble.<br><br>And I must say taking crippling strike an going for a strength-based fighter never got into my head, but looking at it now, its a brilliant idea.<br><br>Blind fight is a must for most melee builds, especially if you may run into invisibles, and most in servers you do.<br>I'd suggest dropping called shot, and take improved disarm instead, since using a large weapon gives you a benefit there, and being a more offensive build (using a two-hander) you need to avoid the attack of opportunity as well as reduce the attacks on you as much as possible.<br><br>But overall, this is a build I'd really like to try out, and the concept is good.

Sorry about the saves, they didn't get into the reedit for some reason.<br><br>Fort: 37<br>Will: 28<br>Refl: 35<br><br>(and there should be 50 skill points leftover not 53)<br><br>As for the thieveing skills I don't really use those in combat (save for UMD of course), so the trap setting is prior to a battle where you can lead your enemy into them. It's a rather versatile character, with a lot of combat power, and I consider the rogue skills as icing on the cake.<br><br>Good point on the disarm, change called shot to disarm and take improved disarm at 20. And you may be able to get away with switching BF to 12, and picking up IKD at 18. Now that I think about it that would be a better way to go.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By jb4479 on 08/07/07 15:49</span></i></p>

I would be tempted to drop Con to 14 and leave it there, drop Dex to 10 (you can guarantee +2 from Cat's grace scroll or potion), and pump Cha to 14 at the start. You could either take Str to 32 or pump Cha to 16 later. Divine Wrath is quite powerful for a level 20 CoT - +9 to hit and +9 divine damage, not bad. With a 14 Cha you can make it last up to 8 rounds, buffed. The Cha will also make your Lay on Hands more powerful - fully buffed you could heal 8 * 20 = 160 HP, or do that much damage to an Undead boss. <br><br>TM

Drop the two Epic Toughness feats and take 2 GRT CON feats instead.
