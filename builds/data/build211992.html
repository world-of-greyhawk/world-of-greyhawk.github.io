Torbel sat at the table by the window.  He didn’t care much for the smoke that filled the small room, and he welcomed the gentle breeze that blew in the window.  Two drinks were on the table, but no-one sat with him; a small cup of a hot, dark and bitter liquid and small glass containing a clear alcoholic syrup, it tasted of somewhat liquorice. He enjoyed the way the two flavours danced and competed with each other as he drank them.  As he relaxed he listened to the chatter of the inn.<br><br><i>”It was him I tell ye!”</i> The exclamation came from a noisy Dwarf close by. <i>”Eidolon it was, not a word of a lie.”</i>  The Dwarf’s acquaintance scoffed. <i>”Hims just stood there bold as brass.  Talking to that nasty piece o’ work Grunak he was.  I was watching, made Grunak pay him double …. fer something or other.”</i>. The Dwarf was getting agitated. <i>”Pah!  Higard, you spout too much bile, no ones ever seen Eidolon, he’s a myth.”</i><br><br>Torbel smiled wryly, <i>Eidolon</i> so that’s what they called him. Grunak … he remembered the burly half-Orc and his henchmen.  He had wanted him to fulfil a contract.  It was a simple enough task that had warranted more money than Grunak was prepared to pay.  Grunak was all talk though; even though Torbel was not a particular tall man he was strong and well toned, he had always had the ability to impose himself on people, they could see the rage that burned inside him.  Grunak had paid him more, it was that or die.<br><br><i>”They say he appears from nowhere, and can pull the darkness in around him even on the brightest of days”</i> Higard continued excitedly. <i>“I know Higard”</i> was the bored response. <i>“Just to look into his eyes can paralyze you with fear … you can’t be looking at him ... tis certain death”</i>. Higard blurted noisly, spitting beer over his companion. <i>“Hey!”</i> shouted the barman, <i>”I told you before Dwarf, keep it down … now get out!”</i>.  Higard and his companion begrudginly got up from the table and headed for the door <i>”Well done Higard, that’s another Inn we can’t go in to.”</i> muttered Vincent.<br><br>Torbel didn’t care much for people knowing his face, especially if he hadn’t put the fear of God into them first.  He threw down some coin to pay for his drinks and anonymously followed to two companions outside.  He followed them for a short while until they were on the road out of town, the two were arguing with each other incessantly.  Torbel picked up his pace and caught up with the two men easily.<br><br><i>”Afternoon gents”</i>. <i>”Wha? Hey? Who are you?”</i> replied Vincent.  Torbel took a deep breath and calmly replied <i>”Why … I am Eidolon”</i>.  Torbel channelled the rage the burned at his inner being and brought it to aide him.  The two journey men stood staring at him, transfixed, paralyzed by the fear that burned in his eyes.  Torbel pulled a dagger from his side and with effortless flashes of his blade made incisive cuts to his foes major blood vessels and organs.  The Dwarf and his companion dropped lifelessly to the road side.  <br><br>Torbel cleaned his blade, sheathed it and moved on, leaving the bodies were they lay.  He was a killer, but he didn’t care much for sneaking around like a common thief … he preferred to look his mark in the eye, the fear on their face fuelled his inner rage, their death breathed life into him.<br><br><br><b>Eidolon</b><br>Barbarian 17/Assassin 10/Rogue 13<br><br><b>Playable from 1 to 40, PvM</b><br><br>Human, Must be non-lawful and evil<br><br>STR: 16 (27)<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 14 <br>WIS: 10<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 12<br><br>01: Bb(1): Luck of Heros, Weapon Focus<br>02: Ro(1)<br>03: Bb(2): Power Attack, Bb: (Uncanny Dodge I)<br>04: Bb(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>05: Bb(4)<br>06: Bb(5): Cleave<br>07: Ro(2): Ro: (Evasion)<br>08: Bb(6): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>09: Bb(7): Knockdown<br>10: Bb(8)<br>11: Bb(9)<br>12: Ro(3): STR+1, Improved Knockdown, (STR=19)<br>13: Bb(10)<br>14: Ro(4)<br>15: Bb(11): Improved Critical<br>16: As(1): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>17: Ro(5)<br>18: Bb(12): Skill Focus: Intimidate<br>19: As(2)<br>20: Ro(6): STR+1, (STR=21)<br><br>21: As(3): Epic Weapon Focus<br>22: Bb(13)<br>23: Bb(14)<br>24: Bb(15): STR+1, Terrifying Rage, (STR=22)<br>25: As(4)<br>26: Ro(7)<br>27: As(5): Epic Prowess<br>28: Ro(8): STR+1, (STR=23)<br>29: As(6)<br>30: Ro(9): Great Strength I, (STR=24)<br>31: As(7)<br>32: Ro(10): STR+1, Improved Evasion, (STR=25)<br>33: Bb(16): Thundering Rage<br>34: As(8)<br>35: Ro(11)<br>36: As(9): STR+1, Epic Skill Focus: Intimidate, (STR=26)<br>37: Ro(12)<br>38: As(10)<br>39: Ro(13): Epic Reputation, Slippery Mind<br>40: Bb(17): STR+1, (STR=27)<br><br>AB: +39/34/29/24 <br>Naked AC: 18 (26 Armor &amp; Shield)<br><br>HPs: maximum of 422<br><br><b>Saves: </b><br>Fort: 23<br>Refl: 23 <br>Will: 17 <i>Slippery mind gives you another role</i><br><br><b>Skills 353: </b><br>Disable Trap 41(43)<br>Discipline 43(51)<br>Hide 10(10)<br>Intimidate 43(61)<br>Move Silently 10(10)<br>Open Lock 41(41)<br>Search 20(22)<br>Spot 20(20)<br>Taunt 43(48)<br>Tumble 40(40)<br>UMD 42(43)<br><br><b>Points of note: </b><br><br><i>Barbarian</i><br><b>- Barbarian Endurance</b> +10% movement rate.<br><b>- Barbarian Rage</b> +6 Str, +6Con, +3 Will, -2 AC<br><b>- Terrifying Rage</b> Will save vs 61+d10 or be panicked for 1d6 rounds.<br><b>- Thundering Rage</b> +2d6 damage on critical hit.<br><br><i>Assassin</i><br><b> - Spell Like abilities: </b> Darkness, Invisibility, Improved Invisibility.<br><b> - Death Attack</b> DC 22, 5d6 damage <i>This isn’t you main form of attack</i>.<br><br><i>Rogue</i><br><b> - Sneak Attack</b> 7d6 damage.<br><b> - Improved Evasion</b> reflex save for no damage.<br><b> - Slippery Mind</b> re-roll failed will save vs mind affects.<br><br><b>Normal Damage</b><br>Weapon of your choice +8 str + 12d6 sneak .<br><br><b>Raging Damage</b><br>Weapon of your choice + 11 str + 12d6 sneak +2d6 on criticals.

Interesting concept. The terrifying rage and then sneaks. This has quite a melee presence if you can sneak. If not your AB is a bit low, which can be helped with rage and UMD of course. Is the save truly 61? Thats good, though not in PvP, because most have fear immunity. This guy would have been just as good going pure rog/Bbn perhaps,but the assassin is for rp I believe, and even though Death attack DC 22 isn't very helpful, it is a nice bonus to bring along. No way you can raise STR to 28? Or stop it at 26?

Thanks for the feedback.<br><br><b>Is the save truly 61?</b><br>Yes, it's based on your intimidate skill which in this case is:<br>43 ranks<br>+1 charisma<br>+3 skill focus<br>10 epic skill focus<br>+4 epic reputation.<br><br><b>This guy would have been just as good going pure rog/Bbn perhaps,but the assassin is for rp I believe</b>, <br>You could drop the assassin levels yes, either way you still have 12d6 sneak attack, 23 rogue wouldn't get you an epic bonus feat though, but you would pick up rogue bonus feats at 16 and 19 (crippling strike and defensive roll/oppurtunist).<br><br>I took assassin as I wanted Imp Invis but not through UMD, and also for some RP I suppose.<br><br><b>No way you can raise STR to 28? Or stop it at 26?</b><br>You could drop Epic Prowess for a Great Str, that would keep your +1 attack, and give you +1 damage, so probably worthwhile.
