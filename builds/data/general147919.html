First off, sorry for posting in your Guild forums in that matter, but unfortunately some recent developments seem to make it necessary.<br><br>During the last two weeks a number of people have been continuously violating our website <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/rules.html" target="_blank">Rules of Conduct</a> in official forums, guild forums and PMs. <br><br>This public service announcement is here to remind everyone that our web site rules are in effect for all types of communication on the BioWare website, including private messages and private guild forums.<br><br><b>Short:</b> As long as you play by the forum rules, you don't need to care about the rest of this post.<br><br>Please be advised that Guild officers and Admins that find certain people disruptive to the atmosphere in their guild forums have the power and right to permanently ban individuals from posting or accessing the guilds forums at their own discretion. Please also note that BioWare will not reinstate peoples posting or reading rights to a guild if an Guild officer made the decision to remove them. <br>As long as the guild leaders are acting within the rules for our website, they have every right to police their own guild and forums.<br><br><b>Short:</b> If you get banned by the leaders of this guild, don't bother with sending me a message complaining about it - I don't care - guild admins have the right to select the people they want in their guild.<br><br>However, BioDevs and BioMods can, at any point and at their own discretion, chose to police a guild forum if they think the forum rules are not properly enforced or get complaints from people about abusive behavior or activity in guild forums or private messages. <br><br>Potential actions that can be taken against people who show disruptive behavior (i.e. violating the rules of conduct) in forums, guild forums or private messages include but are not limited to:<br>- Temporary bans <br>- Permanent bans including CDKey invalidation.<br>- Livetime ban from accessing BioWare's internet services,  including upcoming games, access to our websites, forums, game and patch servers. <br><br>This is the first time I am forced to post such a message   to a guild forum - needless to say that I am not happy about it.<br><br>A guild admin may remove this post in two weeks. Thank you.<br>_________________<br>georg zoeller<br>senior rules and systems monkey<br>[<a href="http://dragonage.bioware.com" target="_blank">da</a> | <a href="http://masseffect.bioware.com" target="_blank">me</a>]<br><a href="http://gulbsoft.de/doku.php/nwn/nwn" target="_blank">My custom NWN content</a><br><br><i>ceterum censeo ambulatiuncula esse delen</i>
