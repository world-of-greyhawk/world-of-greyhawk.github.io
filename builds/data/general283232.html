Right, well I've have been thinking about it for awhile now, and thought I would give everyone an idea of how I want to build my character. This way I can make the best of it. (I just got NwN tonight, so I should be able to build it by tomorrow at the latest.)<br><br>The only thing that I'm positive of so far, is that I want it to primarily be a Ranger/Shadowdancer build. I was thinking of topping it off with a few levels of monk, but we'll get to that shortly. The reason I wanted to go with RGR/SD is because I wanted to utilize the favored enemies (as well as the Ranger's ability to dual wield), and combined them with Shadowdancer so I could get Epic Dodge. <br><br>My plan was to take 21 levels of Ranger so I could get Bane of Enemies, and along the way pick up feats like Disarm, Improve Disarm, and everything that boost my initiative so I have the best chance of striking first. You already know why I want shadow dancer, but I'm curious to know if Rogue would be a better choice? I really like 'Hide in plain sight', so I'm already leaning towards SD. However, if there is a better reason to take Rogue instead, I'm willing to keep an open mind.<br><br>That leaves the third class. I chose monk, because it gives you a bunch of additional feats. Plus, I thought maybe I could utilize the additional wisdom to further increase my AC. . . And I like the idea of being able to run fast. ^.^ I plan on playing alot of PvP, so I want to be able to get the hell out of dodge when I need to! Should I take something else instead of monk?<br><br>You guys are the experts, so lets hear your opinions!<br>_________________<br>You can't kill what was simply never there. . .<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By NelosNasidar on 09/16/07 01:52</span></i></p>

Shadowdancer gives Hide in Plain Sight, an amazing abality. Rogue gives sneak attack instead, which can grant high damage. Both can get Epic Dodge. So, it's pretty much how you like it, a Rogue won't hide as good as a Shadowdancer, but on the other side, without sneak attack Hide in Plain Sight loses a big part of its effective power.<br><br>If you want Monk only for the feats then better take Fighter (since Fighter is the feats class). Monk is great to improve your APR, which is good with Bane of Enemies, but I wouldn't trust the WIS AC bonus to work on a character with less than 18 WIS.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Eh.. I would rather be able to sneak away, rather than do extra damage through sneak attacks. That's what Bane of Enemies is for. ^.^ What does 'APR' stand for again? Also, if my dexterity is 25+, and my Wisdom is 18+, those two will stack for greater AC, correct? Provided I go with Monk.<br>_________________<br>You can't kill what was simply never there. . .

I would say 21 ranger/5 SD/14 Rouge<br>Because that can get you the things you wanted and sneak attack and UMD<br>_________________<br>Willwoms is the most super,  amazing, fabulous, marvellous, exciting, dangerous and lethal dex sneak in Life vs Death.Well will be eventually. *slits your throat*.

Monk is not so bad in your ranger build.<br><br>Monk9/SD5 gives the feats to qualify for epic dodge in a dex build.<br>Monk speed if enough levels.<br>Monk armor bonus if enough levels.<br>Wisdom armor bonus. A ranger typically has wis 14, that adds +2 to AC. Wis items will improve this further.<br>Monk attack table if you wield Kamas.<br>Free monk combat feats (like Improved Knockdown).<br>Better saves.<br><br>Damage against non FEs can be a problem though, unless you have good weapons or there are items (that don't rely on UMD) available that can help you add damage to them.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...
