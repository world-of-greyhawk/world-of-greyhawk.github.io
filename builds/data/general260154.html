How important is taking initiative boosting feats? I keep feeling compelled to take Blooded and then follow up with the other three Initiative feats. I've read that the initiative feats aren't really necessary if you are a Dex build, but how about Strength and caster builds?

Here are my views on initiative.<br><br>The main concern I have when facing an opponent is:  Can he kill/disable me in one shot?<br><br>If the answer is yes, then I want to get the first shot in.<br><br>If I can kill/disable an opponent in one shot than I also want to get that hit in first.<br><br>=====<br><br>If there are no instant kills or disabling effects (OnHit Stun/sleep/daze/etc), then the initiative does not hold as large of an importance to me.  (I would still prefer to hit the other guy first.)<br><br>====<br><br>Initiative is affected by the Dex bonus.  So a high dex build will have a better chance at acting first in the combat round.<br><br>===<br><br>When I make a mellee build, I try to obtain those instant kill feats (dev crit), or a feat that will disable my opponent (IKD, Imp-Disarm) first.  If I have enough feats left over, then I think about hiting the other guy first.<br><br>My personal prefference on feat selection ranks initiative in the mid level importance range.<br><br>1) get AB bosting feats<br>2) get instant kill/disabling feats<br>3) get protection feats<br>4) initiative feats<br>5) fun feats<br><br>It really depends on how I want my character to play out.  If doing a PvP based character, then I have to way my strenghts.  If I have insane AB and a hard to resist dev crit, then I will take more initiative than protection feats.  A good defence is a strong offence.  On the other hand, if I do not have a high AB, then my strenghts lay in other areas that don't need me to act first, so I will want a better defence.<br><br>*shrug*<br><br>Ultimately, you have to look at your build and understand HOW you want to overcome your foe.  Act first and hard, or go the slow and steady route.

Since this topic is here, I have a question on Initiative.<br><br>If I run up to my clueless opponent under Improved Invisibility with Haste and I attack him, do I automatically get the first hit since he didnt know I was there? Even if I have an Initiative Bonus of -1?<br><br>What about under Hide/MS? If you strike an opponent who had no clue you were there, do you automatically strike first?
