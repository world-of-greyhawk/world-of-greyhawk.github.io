looking to make a build that can take and perform well in dragon shape, if possible be a spellcaster in human form. maybe druid/shifter/sorc? the pw i belong too does not allow shifter/monk because of people exploiting the class combo in pvp.<br>_________________<br>Where we belong, there's no one to hurt.

You're being too vague...<br><br>If you want a strong caster with dragon shape the best route IMO is heavy Druid. You know, the Druid class is a very good caster and shifter by itself, although not as versatile as a real shifter, the elemental shapes are very decent and maybe you won't get IGMS and Epic Warding but Storm of Vengeance, Creeping Doom and Fire Storm are excellent spells.<br><br>You state you can't take Shifter with Monk, which is pretty bad. In case you can take Druid with Monk then go for it, it's an awesome combination, if not, then the best choice might be Ranger. A Druid 19 / Ranger 21 can get Dragon Shape, Bane of Enemies, BAB to make 4 APR and decent spells for buffing and casting, with regular DCs. In any case, if you pretend to fight shifted and you can't take Monk you need a class that can raise your BAB.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

my fault for being vague, maybe something like druid/ranger/blackguard? i like the blackguards bulls cause it stacks with others, dark blessing, and his attack is on par with the other mele classes. is it possible to do druid/ranger/blackguard?<br>_________________<br>Where we belong, there's no one to hurt.

Hmmm, well, if you're taking a caster Druid and Ranger, then you won't really get enough levels to add Blackguard, you'll end up losing either Bane of Enemies or a considerable amount of spells and shifting power, so it's no good.<br><br>If you like Blackguard with Druid, good choices for a third class can be Rogue/Assassin, Fighter/Champion of Torm, and if you can make the alignment shift, Paladin.<br><br>The Rogue or Assassin give more sneak attack than Blackguard, Uncanny Dodge and a good skillset.<br><br>Fighter is really only for feats, it's not so impressive, EWS won't work while shifted. Champion of Torm is almost the same, one less feat but a bonus to your saves.<br><br>Taking Paladin (which is usually pretty tough) allows you to take Divine Might / Divine Shield plus some good buffs. Cleric can get the Divine feats as well, with no CHA buffs but with more AB buffs.<br><br>You can leave it at Druid / Blackguard. I suggest at lest 20 Druid levels to get the Elder Elemental Shapes, 20 levels of Blackguard give a decent sneak attack and it's a high BAB class so it sorts out your APR already so it's not a bad choice. Now that I remember, the Blackguard can get Divine Might and Shield too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   but he gets no CHA buffs like a Paladin or AB buffs like a Cleric.<br><br>A nice thing about a Druid/Blackguard is how easy it becomes to cap your STR with buffs since the Blackguard's Bull's Strength stacks with the Druid's Bull's Strength (Technically a Druid alone can cap STR with Empowered Bull's Strength + Blood Frenzy + Aura of Vitality, but the duration of those other two isn't long enough to enjoy, having Blackguard is a lot nicer).<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

is it possible to take assasin? not sure if druids have to be true neutral or they can be evil neutral. i think the death attack would stack nicely with the sneak attack for added damage.<br>_________________<br>Where we belong, there's no one to hurt.

Dev crit in dragon shape... I got pissed off when I learned that dev crit is not functional in dragon shape, but to think the PRC fixed that!
