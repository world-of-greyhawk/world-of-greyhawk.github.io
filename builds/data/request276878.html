I just tried the lionheart build and found it really good and I would like the top PvP builds that are main spell casters(wizards and sorcerers and cleric) minor spell casters like druids, rangers, bards are ok and so basically any build without wizard or sorcerer.It doesn't matter if it' rubbish at PvE it only needs to be good a PvP. Can you please post links.<br><br>Kind Regards<br>Willwoms<br>_________________<br>The inner person is all in the build so if thy build not worthy the person is not worthy.<br><br>To get a good build take a look at this.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>And here's my guild<br><br>[url=ht

Without a server name or some details the best I can do for you is give you some template builds to try since pvp servers can vary quite a bit<br><br><br>38 cleric/1 monk/1 palad<br><br>wis based for a support or archer build with zen archer<br>str based if you want a harmer<br>dex based if you want higher ac<br><br><br>38 sorc/wiz 1 monk/1 paladin<br><br>con based if you want high hp<br>cha based for dc and save<br>int for dc and skills<br><br><br>28 paladin/2 bard/10 rdd<br><br>29 paladin/1 sorc/10 rdd<br><br>str based with dev and divine shield<br><br><br>38 monk/1 ranger/1 wiz with improved spell resist VI

For a main spellcaster build I like a Sorcerer 38 / Paladin 1 / Blackguard 1, that combination really boosts saves sky high, they end above the highest Devastating Critical DC possible, which is very nice.<br><br>My favorite caster build is <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "249788", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>this</a> one (well, since it's my build of course), but it's not a full caster build, but it's strong in both melee and spell power, and quite versatile.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

The best PvP Sorcerors IMO are either A) 38 Sorceror 1 Ranger 1 Paladin, or B) 35 Sorceror 3 Paladin 2 Monk with Divine Shield and uber AC (like, 72 in a +5 environment).<br><br>Clerics, I'd say 38 Cleric 1 Monk 1 Rogue, or 35 Cleric 3 Monk 2 Assassin which nets Uncanny Dodge.<br><br>For a good AB tank, 28 Paladin 2 Bard 10 RDD would be superb.  Or even a Weaponmaster, say 12 Fighter 25 WM 3 Rogue (or some similar variation).<br><br>If you're looking for a build that utilizes Epic Dodge <i>and</i> Self Conceal, try something like 19 Rogue, 14 Fighter, 7 WM.  It nets SC 5, and Epic Dodge - while still maintaining high AB.<br><br>-mantis3
