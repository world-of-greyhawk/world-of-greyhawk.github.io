I used a similar build with cleric/bard/AA on DSO. Very effective against folks with immunities and the cleric buffs were a big help as well. Divine might is a sweet addition to an AA build imho.

You do realise that Paladin's cannot Turn undead, and therefore, are unable to take Divine Might as a feat?<br><br>Did you mean for the build to have 4cleric, and not 4paladin?

Yes he took enough levels to get the paladins turning ability (which is level 3).

Um, aluka?  Please stop posting in threads that have been dead for a year.  If you want to mention them, that's fine, but it's generally considered extremely bad to bounce old threads back to the top of the forum for no particularly good reason.  You could have just as easily posted links in the Sniper of Wisdom thread for those who were interested instead of bumping dead topics to the front at the expense of currently active ones.<br><br>Steve

ok sorry, just seemed like a good idea to bring some of these old builds to light.<br>someone did post them, and I do believe that one of the rules for this forum was give credit where credit is due.<br>with so many builds floating around, many of them are bound to be similar, so i went searching in the archives to see what people did in the past.

I can certainly understand your desire to give credit, which is admirable, but references and links do that job just as well, and don't lead to people coming in to see tons of seemingly new threads, only to find out they are threads from a year ago with a new post which also doesn't actually add any more meat to the original thread.<br><br>Another point is that even the oldest threads are always easy to find just by looking at the thread containing the complete list of builds, so no thread really ever gets completely lost.<br><br>Steve
