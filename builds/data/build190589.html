BAB?  Have you considered taking the last two RDD levels in epic (replace with AA) for an extra attack and better ab?

Why not delay almost all the rdd levels until post epic, if you did an 8/4/8 bard/rdd/AA split you would have a base attack bonus of 17 at level 20 which isnt too bad.<br><br><br>*edit* This would probly mean an almost total reworking of the post epic feats though.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By M1ke47 on 04/15/05 17:32</span></i></p>
