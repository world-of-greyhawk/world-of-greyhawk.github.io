Hi guys, I need some suggestions for a build.  I've been playing on a PW and have stashed away some very nice Monk items.  This world allows you to transfer items between characters and doesn't have any IRL issues (mostly).<br><br>So... I'd like to hear some suggestions for the following type of build:<br><br>- Strength Based Dev Crit Unarmed Monk (not kama based).<br><br>- Must be HEAVY on the monk side (many monk levels).<br><br>- Non-Shifter <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif"> <br><br>I will be putting a custom skin on him, one of those Skeletons with the flaming hands.<br><br>==<br><br>I was thinking Monk/BG/SD.  BG for a little sneak damage and the Bull Strength double buff.<br><br>Monk/Cleric could also be nice.<br><br>Monk/Wiz/PM would do well too.<br><br>What are your thoughts guys?

monk/cleric/(full BaB class) would be a very good way to go. Buffs from cleric will help you alot more than doing RDD. If you want to justify your low AC as monk then cleric is the way to go.

Problem is Bromium stated STR based Dev Crit and no kama based, that takes out Weapon Masters and I don't think even Pale Master will allow you a respectable AC, that's why RDD sounds good. Cleric is always good for a Monk, but you won't be able to use GMW and Darkfire, which would make the RDD version hit harder, though the Cleric will buff higher AB and AC, it's a bit harder to get a high Dev Crit DC with a Cleric, since you'll have to spend a few points on WIS, and you'll get Dev Crit late, where the RDD version could get roughly about 10 more STR than the Cleric and get Dev Crit much sooner...<br><br>The custom skin gets the RDD wings anyway? I've never used custom skins... I wonder if that's good or bad, RDD makes sense as a fire based guy at any rate.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 04/14/07 20:03</span></i></p>

Take a look at the unarmed version of my Temple Guardian build:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "226517", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>You can add Dev Crit either by dropping 2 Great Str (costing 1 AB and Dev Crit DC) or by taking 4 more CoT levels (costing some SR). The advantage to this over the Monk/Sroc/RDD build is that it gets 6 APR and actually does slightly higher damage (thanks to WS/EWS, despite the 8 lower Str).<br><br>Monk 25/Sorc 1/RDD 14 is another way to go, taking Sorc 1 at level 21. Has slightly less monk than the Temple Guardian, 5 APR, less damage, but higher AC (thanks to RD bonus), RDD immunities, and higher Str (therefore 3 higher AB and 4 higher Dev Crit DC). If you are building for level 40 and can change alignment, you could also take Monk 1-24, change alignment, and go with Bard 1/RDD 14 (gains you UMD and a weak song), change back to lawful for a final tumble dump at Monk 25.<br><br>TM

Well, this build will be played from 1 to 40.  The world is (on average) a +5 item world.  Monsters do not have Dev Crit.<br><br>I'm leaning towards Monk Palemaster.  I don't want to have to do any alignement shifting, that would cost some tokens.  <br><br>Now a Dev Crit Monk PM would be tricky.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   The ability to cast true strike might come in handy, but I'm pretty sure I can max out my +20 cap without it.<br><br>It's a tough call.  Not sure if I want to go offense or defense on this one.  If I go defense then EDR would be good to have, offense would be dev crit.  I don't think I'd be casting any type of worthwile spells with this guy.<br><br>I basically want a fast flaming skeleton to come in and smack some heads.  I was thinking Dev Crit because as a puncher, I can't buff my weapon for extra damage, so the chance at an instant kill would be nice.  <br><br>I had not thought of CoT as a secondary class, I'll have to look into that.<br><br>I'm very open to suggestions my main thing is that he has to be a puncher and heavy on the monk levels.  He's not a PvP character.

Note that you can't get keen on your hands, either (unless there are some custom gloves on your PW), so you are limited to at most 19-20 crit range. So Dev Crit isn't the most effective for Monks, especially compared to Scim or Kukri builds. Even a kama monk can get the range up to 18-20 (still not great...). <br><br>Personally, I prefer the non-dev crit versions myself - freeing up 2 feats for more Great Str or fewer Fighter or CoT levels. But if you want to go the Dev Crit route, I would probably use the Monk 25/Sorc 1/RDD 10 build to get the highest DC on it. Note that you will have an XP penalty from the time you take the Sorc level on, so if XP is hard to come by I would switch to Human (but you lose 40 HP).<br><br>Here it is. I moved Sorc and RDD back to reduce the XP penalty as much as possible, you can move it up to level 21 if you want to get Dev Crit a bit sooner. Be sure to leave 1 RDD level for 36 or later for a final spellcraft dump, and 1 monk level for 37 or later for a final Tumble dump.<br><br>Monk(25), Sorcerer(1), Red Dragon Disciple(14), Dwarf<br><br>STR: 16 (38)<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 16 (18)<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 10 (12)<br>CHA: 6 (8)<br><br>Hitpoints: 536<br>Skillpoints: 148<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 27/25/25<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +10, Mind Effects: +2, Poison: +2<br>BAB: 25<br>AB (max, naked): 43 (melee), 28 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 33/33<br><br>Discipline 43(57), Lore 8(11), Spellcraft 39(41), Tumble 40(42), 18 left over (you can pick up a few more by taking Sorc earlier).<br><br>01: M(1): Luck of Heros, {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br>02: M(2): {Deflect Arrows}<br>03: M(3): Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br>04: M(4): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>05: M(5)<br>06: M(6): Blind Fight, {Knockdown, Improved Knockdown}<br>07: M(7)<br>08: M(8): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>09: M(9): Toughness, {Improved Evasion}<br>10: M(10)<br>11: M(11)<br>12: M(12): STR+1, Improved Critical: Unarmed, (STR=19)<br>13: M(13)<br>14: M(14)<br>15: M(15): Power Attack<br>16: M(16): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>17: M(17)<br>18: M(18): Great Cleave<br>19: M(19)<br>20: M(20): STR+1, (STR=21)<br>21: M(21): Epic Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br>22: M(22)<br>23: M(23)<br>24: M(24): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR=23)<br>25: So(1) <i> *20% XP Penalty from here on </i><br>26: RDD(1)<br>27: RDD(2): Overwhelming Critical: Unarmed, (STR=25)<br>28: RDD(3): STR+1, (STR=26)<br>29: RDD(4): (STR=28)<br>30: RDD(5): Devastating Critical: Unarmed<br>31: RDD(6)<br>32: RDD(7): STR+1, (STR=29), (CON=18)<br>33: RDD(8): Great Strength II, (STR=30)<br>34: RDD(9): (INT=12)<br>35: RDD(10): (STR=34), (CHA=8)<br>36: RDD(11): STR+1, Great Strength III, (STR=36)<br>37: M(25): Armor Skin<br>38: RDD(12)<br>39: RDD(13): Great Strength IV, (STR=37)<br>40: RDD(14): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=38)<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 04/16/07 20:09</span></i></p>
