Bard/Weapon Master/Pale master<br><br>Pale weapon<br><br>The build that I’m working on at the moment is a Bard WM PM but I’ve been trying to work through a couple of ideas for this but have not worked out what is best. I have seen a couple of builds posted but not quite what I was looking for. I’m going for strength based and the PW I play on has no Dev crit so I’m not looking for a build with out that. I was looking at 4 Attacks and using Shield and Weapon.<br><br>I did a Search and these are the 3 builds that came up<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "213417", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> <br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "139482", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> <br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "211675", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> <br><br><br>Having a look at the other builds i was still not sure how to do the build so i came up with 2 different builds.

Any reason for not starting with STR 15, INT 14, perhaps DEX 14 and taking STR+1 at level 4? You would just lose +1 to AB/damage at level 1-3 but would win a few skill points, +1 to AC and +1 to reflex saves.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.Detail&amp;id=856" target="_blank">Character Build Calculator</a>(works with Excel, Open Office) 2.83: updated to NWN 1.69.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kamiryn on 12/06/05 12:32</span></i></p>

well if you want to have a bard wm pm ( i hate wm lol,such a feat waste ) i would suggest to go with epic bard , 23bard 7wm 10pm ...ofc ac would suffer , but lastin insp will add +5 at least , prolly switch to only 20 bard ,loose one epic feat and go with 13 pm for +2 ac and 1 epic energy res. <br><br>it would be a feat starved build , but you will have the nice crits and curse + taunt+song+warcry will help a lot to hit your enemies. <br><br>if your pw has no kd immunty you will get most dexers with balagorns spam , and str based chars you will hit. <br><br>prolly should try to fit esf taunt in.

Hehe I still prefer my version;  <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "213417", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> <br><br>However I have since made a few other versions of the build, quite a nice one is a dex based version using Dagger for the 19-20 x2 crit:<br><br>Stats str - 12, dex - 15, con - 14, int - 14, wis - 8, cha - 14<br><br>levelling bard 1-10, pm 11-12, the wm 13 - 20, this means you do have to take weapon finesse at lvl 15 so hopefully you'll be able to survuive until then<br><br>then pm 21-28, wm 29-39 &amp; bard 40, taking all standard epic feats as Great Dexterity (i-vii) with bonus weapon master feats; epic prowess, epic weapon focus &amp; armor skin.<br><br>Naturally all stat increases go into dexterity -&gt; 32 Dex<br><br>This will give an AB of 45 (26 BAB + 4 wf/ewf/ep +11 dex +4 wm levels) with non magical dagger, AC of 45 naked (10 +4 boneskin +11 dex +2 armor skin +8 tumble), saves of 20 fort, 21 will &amp; 34 reflex &amp; a maximum hp of 414<br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!

Acid ER is helpful for a melee build against Mestil's Acid Sheath.  With lasting inspiration and Level 12 PM, you are looking at +5 and + 8 to AC.

something came in my mind , i remember i usedd 21bard 7wm 12 pm ... wont get the epic energy reduction feat but its more playable because you can take the 20th bard lvl earlier and thus get lasting insp in the mid 20ties , the 21st bard lvl on 40 for the skills.
