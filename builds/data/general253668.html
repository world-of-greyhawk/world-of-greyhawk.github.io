I'd get a DFI LanParty board <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  <br><br>Okay, you don't really <b>need</b> all those bay components for your water cooling, and they're not even that "cool". The DDR cooler looks awesome, though -- I think I'll order one next week <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">   A HD component is practically useless, one 120mm fan will provide enough air circulation around your HDs to keep them cool (assuming you have anywhere from 1 to say 4 HDs). If you want a powerful pump, Iwaki MD20RLZ is probably the most powerful around for computer water cooling systems. And if you're looking for a ready-for-install package, the Asetek WaterChill sets are the best IMO.<br><br>Something I'd recommend is VRAM heatsinks to go with the VGA block <a href="http://www.coolputer.fi/default.asp?sivuille=1" target="_blank">These</a> look nice.<br><br>The Stacker is a quality case and Antec makes good PSUs, so I'd say it's nice. I'd buy a better VGA card though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>Have fun with your new computer!<br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 09/24/06 16:14</span></i></p>
