With his decent level in sorc and a charisma level he can effectively cast alot of spells.  He uses the power of the might Scimitar to get off a high critical when he uses his Keen edge spell and will ravange his enemies with Devastating critical.  With his high defense of 55 natural and concelament bonus from improved invisiblity he will effectively dogde many attacks. Defense comes from the fact that he can where a Full Plate and a Tower Sheild.  He can also cast the might Epic Mage armor to boost him up.

Keep Dex and Wisdom at 10 and have let Str and Cha be at 10. Other than that, it's okay.

The reason I have my Dex and Wisdom at 8 is so I could have the highest possible Strength and Charisma. The Dex can easy be brought up buy casting cats grace or throught items. I also don't have a problem losing 1 in my Wisdom. I needed atleast 25 strength for Devastating Critical. I also thought about possibly replacing the Great Strength with Epic Skill Focus: Discipline making him harder to knockdown or Getting a Spell Focus or Spell Penetration making a more effective to bypass defenses.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By XyberKnight on 08/05/04 22:04</span></i></p>

He he, nice build!<br><br>I have made something similar (Tyrial Dragonheart, Sorcedin I called it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> ). Only I used 4 levels of paladin to get Divine Might and Divine Shield. My idea was to concentrate on being a melee character and use the sorcerer levels to add extra enhancements (keen edge, flame weapon, elemental shield, etc). The offensive spells are also usefull ofcourse <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .<br><br>I had two versions made one with Devastating Critical and less epic spells (only one) and one more focussed on epic spells (for servers that don't use Devastating Critical).<br><br>If you are interested I can send you my version, or I could just post it here if you want to.

just curious... can the sorcerer really take dev crit as an epic feat?<br><br>good build though, I've also used RDD paladin sorcerer combos in the past... they rarely turn out bad. my favourite uses divine shield/might and extra turning for extra melee abilities though, not easy fitting in autostill early then though.<br><br>happy gaming <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

The nice thing about this build is if you want to you could replace the overwhelming critical and devastating critical with other Epic spells or throwing on Epic spell penetration or Focus by also removing the Great Strengh. That way you are more likely to hit the opponet. To do this all you would have to do is switch around the last 2 sorc and RDD levels

They are both much the same, the first has a bit better AB, a little more AC, and ofcourse dev. crit. While the last can use more epic spells, it just depends on what you would like to play.<br><br>Mine could probably use a few adjustments too, so any advice on how to improve is ofcourse welcome <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

I have a question about this build.  I thought it would be interesting, so I've started it on a PW I play on.  Because of the Pally levels, I want to wear heavy armor and play up front.  However, this causes arcane spell failure most of the time.  How do you do it?  Change clothes real quick everytime you want to cast?  Just be in light armor and flank?

Auto Still 3 allows you to cast lvl 9 and under spells with any # of spell failure. Thats how he casts with plate on.

I think he meant that it was hard to play the character from level 1.<br><br>I'd say take "still spell" early on instead of in Epic levels.

At that point you'll probably want to sell off your armor, run around in robes and play as a burly sorceror. Once you achieve the Auto Still Spell feats you can start casting spells without arcane failure.<br><br>As Martin suggested, you could take Still Spell feat early and then cast a few Stilled spells while in armor. Perhaps you could take Still Spell at level 3? I'm not sure if it's available on a Paladin level.<br><br>Regardless, if you're going to take this build onto a PW I strongly encourage you to level it up offline in a trainer mod to make sure it develops as you'd like it to. If you want to do this with your PW character, you can Save your online character to your local vault and then level up that version offline. Take notes of the development and keep them handy as the online version of your characted advances.<br><br>If any of this isn't clear (or is incorrect) point it out.
