Im not seeing a reason to take so many rouge levels pre epic.<br><br>i would make it with an elf, thenjust do 24 ranger,9 rouge, for tumble and umd, to add playability while you have to deal with cross classing,5 shadow dancer, then on 39 take epic dodge and what have you with level ten of rouge. and if your going to be using so many skill points, take the 2 points out of wis and dump em in int to get an exttra 40 points. and finnaly top it all off with 25 ranger.<br><br>this way you keep more or less the same feats and add a few points of ab.<br>_________________<br>In the beginning the universe was created.

Yeah, I'd definitely stick with Halfling, but I'd also move a bit of the levelling around:<br><br>Go with 12 RGR/4 Rogue/4 SD pre-epic. This will net you +2 BAB and also +1 to all your saves.<br><br>I'd also seriously consider taking a final Rogue level at level 37 or later to top up some of the major skills. You'd lose a FE by doing this (and thus some of the FE bonus to damage), but I think it's worth the trade.<br><br>I'd also dump Blinding Speed and the Epic Toughness feat. I'd move Bane to your Ranger bonus feat (It's only a couple levels later, so wth, right?) and take GRT DEX feats at levels 33 and 36.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

And country Berbun, he was taking about your spelling, not Harl3quin's. Try putting your G before the U. Like this r o G U e, not r o U G e. A ranger is actually able to cast divine spells, if he has the wisdom to do it. But they are non to good. So dropping a bit wis is feasible for INT, or doing a CON, CHA and WIS drop by 6 total points, for two more dex. Gives access to epic dodge earlier. And you are on to something when you talk about spring attack. It does absolutely nothing. Take something else.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 08/18/05 01:58</span></i></p>
