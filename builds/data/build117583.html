hello, I was inspired to try and make a character that came close to being like the "WitchBlade" character from the comics and Tv. This wont be the best layout for I made this attempt at 3am. To anyone who knows who WitchBlade is perhaps you can help me improve what I made. My goal was to have a char that was deadly with a long sword but agile and tough enough to survive. This is what I came up with. Sry no per lvl choices here due to it being 3am.<br>I'm listing the end results....<br>Nakid...<br>Fighter(7), Paladin(12), Weaponmaster(21)<br>str:20(5)<br>dex:13(1)<br>con:14(2)<br>int:13(1)<br>wis:13(1)<br>cha:14(2)<br>AC 14 HP 485<br>AB +46/+41/+36/+31 can these be improved??<br>damage 1-3 +5(crit:20/x2)<br>fort: 27<br>reflex: 25<br>will:21<br>Base Attack: 40<br>SR: nil (sadly)<br><br>skills: Half I choose then after ..ugh..."Reconmended"..<br>appraise 1<br>bluff 2<br>concentration 17<br>craft armor 1<br>craft trap 1<br>craft weapon 1<br>discipline 48<br>heal 23<br>hide 3<br>intimidate 6<br>listen 9<br>lore 1<br>move silently 1<br>parry 20 (does anyone use this skill??I'm mean really?)<br>persuade 2<br>search 2<br>spellcraft 7<br>spot 3<br>taunt 4<br>tumble 10<br><br>ok the above needs work I know...<br><br>Feats...<br>armor prof: light,med,heavy<br>armor skin<br>aura of courage<br>cleave<br>divine grace<br>divine health<br>divine shield<br>dodge<br>epic character<br>epic prowess<br>epic reflexes<br>epic sup weapon focus<br>epic toughness 2<br>epic weapon focus (longsword)<br>epic weaponmaster<br>expertise<br>imporved critical (longsword)<br>increased multipler<br>ironwill<br>ki critical<br>ki damage<br>lay on hands<br>mobility<br>power attack<br>quick to master<br>remove disease<br>shield prof<br>smite evil<br>spring attack<br>superior initiative<br>superior weapon focus<br>toughness<br>turn undead<br>weapon focus (longsword), (shortsword)<br>weapon of choice (longsword)<br>weapon prof (martial)<br>weapon prof (simple)<br>weapon specialization (longsword)<br>WW attack.<br><br>Spells: all 3rd lvl and lower cleric spells.<br><br><br>Ok so after rereading what I did...sigh...Why do some of the feats seem like there the same and I unintentially doubled up on them? Well perhaps there is a "WitchBlade" fan out here who can help me tidy this developing character up a little. I'm sure there are some choices I made that are not needed.<br>thnx for any help/guidance I get.<br><br>Godspeed!<br><br>Nayonaq<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 02:55</span></i></p>
