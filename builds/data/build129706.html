This has made alot of people quite angry, and has been widely regarded as a bad move.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Country_Berbun on 08/09/05 14:55</span></i></p>

I got 51 dual-wield AB with 10/28/2, and 36 Dexterity.

If all you do is want some higher AB switch your rogue levels for bard levels. That will give you access to true strike. Other than that unless you change around the build drastically you are not going to see much of an AB improvement. I was also going to suggest you could get a few more skill points by moving up one of your rogue levels to be your first level. This costs you 1 AB overall, but nets you I think another 14 skill points (if my math is correct).<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>
