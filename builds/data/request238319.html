Some servers have it so that a 1 roll always fails.  Do you remember if you rolled a 1?

Say a halfling with 36 DEX, plus maxed from items for 48 and only Pal pre-epic would equal AB 54 plus True strike he would have 74 in AB on the best attack AT BEST, +4 perhaps from Improved Disarm. He must've been lucky, seeing as your song should reduce his AB by 2 AND improve your Discipline. I have no clue how he could easily disarm you, only that it could happen. <br><br>Hm, now that I have written everything above I realized that with that AB he must have a small weapon, so another -4 from that. He could be using STR-build and 2-hander, then subtract 2 from the number above (for the difference in STR and DEX for a halfling).<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Strange.<br><br>I have a simple solution to not getting disarmed: don't use a weapon <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>"And one calculates <i>time</i> from the <i>dies nefastus</i> on which this fatality arose – from the <i>first</i> day of Christianity! – <i>Why not rather from its last?</i> – <i>From today?</i> – Revaluation of all values!"

2 questions:<br>1 - was your character evil? If he disarmed you on a Smite, he would have also added his Cha bonus to the AB.<br>2 - what size weapon were you using and was he using? He gets +4 to the discipline check for every size difference. If he had a large weapon and you had a tiny one, that's +12 to him.<br><br>TM

You can't smite and disarm with the same blow. He also said the character who disarmed him was a half one, so max size weapon used is medium.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

He must've been spamming it and he got lucky, say, he's a 10 monk/29 paladin/1 wizard, you didn't say anything about him, but he <b>can</b> reach 10 APR with two kamas and haste, ultra-spam Improved Disarm 10 times every 6 seconds (is it possible to even do it? I've found extremely hard to spam, let's say, IKD, when you make so many APR) and you'll hit rather soon.

I don't think the number of Disarm and IKD attempts equal your attacks per round.  It's a 1 use per round activity, plus if you are hasted you get another action sooner.<br><br>So I don't think 10/round will ever work.

You can spam as many IKD, called shots, etc. as you have ApR.

What I dislike is when someone starts a topic and never responds. I have seen it times and again.

Have you tried spamming IKD, Called Shot or Improved Disarm with 10 APR? even with hotkeys it's somewhat complicated to get 10 out of 10.<br><br>LOl, try to spam Disarm (not Improved Disarm), and they get an attack of opportunity each time, I though it would get restricted to 1, but man was I killed fast.
