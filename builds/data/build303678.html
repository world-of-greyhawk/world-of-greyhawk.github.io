With the popularity of divine damage builds, I'm actually surprised this hasn't been done.  It's basically the evil counterpart to <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "295887", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Divine Howitzer</a>, but with the utility of the bard spell book and skillset at the cost of a bit of damage.  There is one other build in the search engine with the same classes, Mithdradates'  <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "196205", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Lolth's Sting (AA 11/ Bard 16/ Blackguard 13)</a>, but it goes for a much greater balance at the expense of raw unholy goodness (er... evilness?).  While there are many regrets, and a laundry list of "wish I could fit in....," I think the end product is pretty decent.  Defenses stink, but the ranged damage is pretty impressive.

I figured his defenses were awful anyways, and feats are so tight, I decided to let it go.  One could easily re-arange the leveling to fit in DS, but a feat would have to be lost, and it would have to be either Rapid Shot or Imp Crit.  Damage dealing is her strength.  I didn't think it worthwhile to sacrifice that for a substantial, but in the end insufficient defensive boost.<br><br>     Speaking of those defenses, it's not quite as bad as it looks.  She can eventually get her DEX high enough that w/ some gear, her AC can surpass full plate.  She has full tumble, haste, and improved invis.  She <i>can</i> run, and she <i>can</i> hide, and she will probably need to do both.  Saves, of course, are from merely very good, to excellent, and eminently buff-able.  HPs, however, stink, and there's not too much to be done about that.  She really ought to avoid being in melee (need I remind anyone about the lack of Uncanny Dodge?), but she should be able to stand up to the ranged attacks, and spells, that are thrown at her.<br><br>     The bard spell book actually compliments her quite well.  Cat's Grace and Eagle's Splendor are of course givens, but w/ a mighty bow, Bull's is handy.  The various listen boosting spells can be handy (as you'll want to stay as far away as possible from your prey).  Grease and Slow can help keep those enemies away.  Haste and imp invis are godsends.  Plus, w/ a halfway decent caster stat, you might even be able to pull off a Dominate Person or two.  <br><br>    She isn't really all that soloable.  If you excel at keeping out of attack range w/ an archer, she can dish out the hurt, but if she gets mobbed, she's going to go down in a hurry.  She's really best suited to party play, where she can rely on others to keep her safe while raining down her unholy hatred.<br><br>     Towards that end, an alternative would be to go bard17/BG4/AA19.  You'd get a sweeter bard song, Divine Shield (at the cost of Imp Crit or Rapid Shot), and a greater spell book.  You'd lose two bonus feats (two great dex), and three points off of enchant arrow, for an AB loss of four.  That said, a 46 AB is still pretty dangerous.  Real downside is you'd have even more missing feats to lament, as there just isn't room for Curse Song.  It might be an ok build, but at the same time, would probably be trying to do too much.<br><br>     Anyways, she's not the greatest archer out there, but Divine Damage is always fun, and she at least does that well.  Plus, she's a badass bard.  Those are always cool.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>Edit: Also, my first posted build, and quite possibly my last.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 03/21/09 17:59</span></i></p>

Base Damage: 1d8 + 13<br>w/ DM: +9 divine<br>self buffed, w/ lucky ES: +11 Divine<br>w/ bard song: +2<br>w/ +12 to CHA, and bard song: 1d8 + 13 + 15 +2, or 31-38, 93-114 on a crit<br>Toss on up to another +4 w/ a mighty bow.<br><br>I think those numbers are correct.  They're certainly in keeping with what I saw when I tested her.  Note that all of the above are with mundane arrows.

I'll buy that.   Ya could still get a casting of a fourth level spell, so imp invis wouldn't be completely gone (and, as you say, it's easily dispellable anyways).  You do lose the AC boost from your bard song, but if the idea is to max damage, then who cares?  Not like a +2 to AC 10 or 11 times a day is going to make a tremendous difference.  Sure.  One more on her EA.  <br><br>Towards that end, the first two DEX bonuses could easily be dropped in favor of more CHA.  That would make a 20/30 final DEX/CHA, which are prettier numbers, and you'd still have a 50 AB.  Oo... lots of pretty numbers that way.
