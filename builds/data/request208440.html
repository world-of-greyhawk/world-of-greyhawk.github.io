I can see pursuing spell focus and greater for the offensive spells' schools, but is there much benefit to taking spell focus in one of the more protective schools, like abjuration (spell mantles and the like)?  In other words, does anyone have a general ranking for the spell schools, in terms of best to take focus on versus least effective to take spell focus/greater/etc. on?<br><br>thanks<br>pse

The only Abjuration spells that have actual DCs are Banishment and Dismissal.  Spell Focus would not effect your breaches, dispels, or mantles at all.<br><br>Generally, if I'm going for a pure wizard, I tend to take two spell focus/greater spell focus/epic spell focus.  I use a gnome and take Illusion and then either Evocation or Necromancy.  I've been leaning more and more towards necromancy, simply because there are more useful spells throughout the spell levels with DCs.  While fireballs and the like are nice early on, some of the most powerful Evocation spells, like ILMS/IGMS, Ice Storm, and the Bigby spells don't have DCs, so they don't benefit from spell foci.  You could also just go Evocation and Necromancy if you like.  I have a soft spot for Illusion, because of some of the nice disabling and instant death effects.  Of course now that PK and Weird are properly considered mind affecting spells rather than death magic, the sheer ease with which immunity to mind spells can be gotten might lure me to the evoc/necro combination.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 08/14/05 01:46</span></i></p>
