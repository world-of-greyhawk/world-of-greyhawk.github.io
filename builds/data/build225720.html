I havn't really come up with a name for this one yet, something nordic is on my mind. Anyway this is my very first build, I used the search engine and found nothing like this.  So I would love alot of feed back on how to make this character better. I'm currently playing him through the NWN Campaign, I plan to use him alot but before I get too far I want to make sure he can be improved and where.<br><br>Thank you ahead of time for the feed back. You don't have to be gentle if you don't want to be. But just keep in mind my limited experince in building a character and this being my first one.

Tis a shame you have opted for WM in this build. Solely due to the pre-reqs for it (Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, Expertise, Whirlwind Attack and Weapon Focus) thats 6 feats used just to qualify for the class. <br><br>At first glance I would suggest dropping Great Cleave as you are not going for Over or Dev Crit - Cleave should be sufficient.<br><br>Epic Toughness I? 20 Hit points Epic Prowess would do better here as your AB is a pretty low 36. The trouble is the three classes all rely on different requirements. WM &amp; Barb is based on STR in this case and Druid for the WIS. <br><br>The Focus in CON seems a bit of a waste in epic levels, you would be better to take Dwarf to get the extra 2 points to CON at startup and the -2 to CHA penalty - that way one feat in epic levels can be dropped<br><br>Other Feats really worth considering:<br><br>Extend Spell<br>Still Spell<br>Combat Casting - if you want to cast in combat<br>Epic Prowess<br>Terrifying Rage (can be taken at 15th Barb level)<br>Epic Skill Focus: Intimidate<br>Epic Skill Focus: Taunt (if you put skill ranks in it)<br><br>Skills: <br><br>Consider the use of Taunt - Barb class skill<br>Spread your Druid levels across the life of the build to take advantage of the Spellcraft bonus.<br>Parry? - worthless it does not do what it says on the tin<br>Lore? - quite what this is in aid of on this class mix is  unclear. <br>Persuade? - again not sure of the aim of this - I would opt to maximise Intimidate instead of Persuade/ Bluff given the lack of skill points.<br>Spot - perhaps take Listen over Spot - particularly as it is a class skill for Barbs and can be developed until 40th easier than Spot with WM.<br><br>Level Progression <br><br>Take 4 Druid Levels pre-epic only - to preserve your BAB at 19, or better yet wait until 21st to preserve it at 20. Doing that will allow you take all 7 WM levels pre-epic - which can only improve your melee effectiveness.<br><br>Revisit your starting stats - consider dropping STR to 14 and bumping DEX, CON, WIS and INT to 14 - the reason being that all these four will then benefit from a +2 modifier. <br><br>DEX - the reason being that this is the highest value you can get in Medium Armor wearing Breast Plate (you do not have access to Heavy Armor Proficiency as a Barbarian or WM).<br><br>CON - this frees up a bonus stat during progression - swap for STR<br><br>WIS - fress up a bonus stat during progression - swap for STR.<br><br>INT - gives you another skill you can max out<br><br>From a personal view point I would drop Weapon Master, probably for either Bard or CoT - Bard for the Song, Skillset (including Tumble); CoT for the increase in Feats and Saves.<br><br>Either Way hope this comments help you.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 01/02/06 08:43</span></i></p>
