I had high hopes for this build.  Death Attack and ranged weapons, it seemed to me, were a match made in heaven.  Paralyze them before they even get close?  Yes, please!  I was also hoping for some synergy between the Intelligence-driven Death Attack and the Intelligence-driven Wizard spells.  Unfortunately, neither of these things came anywhere near making up for the build's lack of Epic Dodge, Self Concealment, enough Wizard levels to be good, and massive Sneak Attack damage.  As it stands, it's pretty much a bad Assassin, a bad Arcane Archer, and a bad Wizard, and it's not, unfortunately, greater than the sum of its parts.  Oh, well.  I'm posting it anyway, more as a cautionary tale than anything else.<br><br><br>Elf<br><br>Any Evil<br><br>Str 12<br>Dex 18<br>Con 12<br>Int 16<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 8<br><br>1.

I like your idea behind the build, even if it didn't turn out.<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick. Long ago I learned to strike swiftly and without scruple. I trouble no man without cause, but one who attacks me had best resolve himself to die!

You know, we all start out and have an idea for a build (at least we all should <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  ) and we work with it to see if we can make it work.  Some do, some dont!   I do like the idea behind this build.  I am wondering what would happen if you went 10 assassin 18 aa?  Do you need the 12 wiz lvls?  I am lost as I do not have my game present, and I wont for about a week (holidays <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  )   but I am wondering what the extra 8 lvls in assasin give (besides death attack) that the 8 lvls of aa wouldnt, or vice versa?   Instead of looking at this as an assasin/aa, maybe it would be better to look at it as an  aa/assasin?  hmm....  i will have to think on this, or maybe an assasin or aa expert (which i am not) could help out.<br><br>Peace

You'd also lose the option of taking Imp Sneak Attack as a bonus feat. You also lower the DC of your Death Attack by 8 points.<br><br>I tried a build with these classes before and could never come up with something I liked.

I had to drop Disarm Trap and Search, both of which I wanted in the build.  I think it would be pretty hopeless if you took the focus off of Int and moved it to Cha.  And, even if you ignore that, the build still suffers terribly from its lack of Epic Dodge and SC.  Rogue/Wizard/AA builds are going to walk all over this kind of character.
