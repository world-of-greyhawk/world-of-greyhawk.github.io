BG doesn't have listen as a class <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  so Taunt it is. And very hard at that point to justify Elf. . . Human nets you a feat and 43 skill points, which would let you max Taunt and its counter, Concentration.

Nice one, I assume this is for BL. I have some suggestions for feats. How about taking initiative instead of toughness and improved initiative instead of great smite IX? <br><br>I understand you'd have 60's ac with divine shield, so if someone takes a paladin smiter to you with even higher ab then I advise you ignore the ac and focus on getting the first swing. Chances are that it will be the last.

You assume correctly.  I like the idea because, well, it's accurate.  The smiter is smitable; one must be careful when making paladin-ade.  And you could keep toughness, just use your extra human feat.<br><br>Cheers, D O'Brien.<br><br>Ithacan<br>_________________<br>We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender - Winston Churchill<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Ithacan on 06/19/07 12:34</span></i></p>
