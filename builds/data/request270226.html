Heres a challenge. Not sure if this has been done before so i'll ask. A druid that actually uses the wolf form constantly to fight. No more than 10levels of druid. No PM/RDD/Sorc/Cleric/SD/Shifter<br><br>On a world with +5 top equip (same as my other post) Doesn't have to be an uber killer just something thats got good AC and can hit its enemies (Dex possibly)???

Well the 10 druid level max really hurts as you get improved shapes at level 12 (which is a  12 str, 2 con and 4 ac difference)how about a 12 druid/6 monk/22 assassin, max wisdom for ac, leave str and dex pretty low (since they'll be overidden by shapeshift anyways)and put as much as you can into intelligence for your death attacks, pick feats as needed but armor skin and great wisdoms sound good. <br><br>Or perhaps druid12/barbarian16/assassin12, the ac will be lower than the monk build and you'll get less apr but you'll be able to use terrifying rage while in wolf form and you'll get a higher ab.<br><br>if you insist on the 10 level max for druid just replace with more levels in one of the other classes<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By nhaislip78 on 04/05/07 23:48</span></i></p>

If you are stoneskined, you can pierce other creature's stoneskin if you use natural weapons.  I know it's weird, but that's how it is.  I had a character that had to resort to punching stoneskined mages.

A major problem with Druid Animal forms are:  How to do damage in melle?<br><br>Without the benefit of Weapon buffs, you are going to have less AB and Damage than a regular weapon user.<br><br>That leaves a few alternatives for damage sources.<br><br>1) sneak damage<br>2) stunning/IKD opponents<br>3) curse song, Wounding Wispers<br>4) Mage Acid Sheath/Elemental Shield/Death Armor<br>5) Divine Favor<br>6) Smite<br>7) Palemaster fancy touch attacks<br><br><br>You can't dev crit with an animals creature weapon.<br>You can't Weapon Focus/specialize an animals creature weapon.<br>You can't add poison to a creature weapon (see assasin/blackguard affinity to do that).<br><br>===<br><br>So, as a big bad wolf, you'll have to think of HOW you are actually going to do damage.  Expecting to rely only upon biting is not going to work.<br><br><br>A wolf Bard would be a good idea.  You can curse song and have wounding wispers to counter attack with when they hit you.<br><br>A barbarian Rage Wolf would RP nice as a werewolf theme.

So many mentions of Divine might and -shield here, and none states the obvious.<br><br>A druid/Monk is a must more than anything a must in such a build and the only availible alignment for that is LN.<br>That makes both BG and Paladin impossible. There's nowhere near all servers that allows alignment changes, and in many it's at best quite tricky.<br>That leaves cleric for Divine might/shield and that's okay, but you will not have the CHA as a bonus to saves.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Heh heh, you got me. I've made a few of those starting straight Paladin to get Divine feats ASAP and BAB, then just go evil rampage killing style to try to become neutral along the good-evil axis, which is normally easier than lawful-chaotic axis. It's relatively simple following that line, but true, impossible on some servers. However, Divine Might is still one of his best chances for damage in such a build and he stated no Cleric, so it's pretty much Paladin or nothing.<br><br>Supposing you can't change alignment at all, I agree sneak or death attack is going to be one of your best choices.
