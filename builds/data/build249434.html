BEsides CC/ICC is useless if you don't have any other modal feats, namely Expertise/Imp.expertise.

You might wanna test this, but I seem to remember that when you cast in defensive mode and get hurt the concentration DC adds up. Whereas with ICC you start at DC 0.

I definitely concede that ICC isn't of greatest use to a combat-focused cleric.<br><br>I must guiltily admit that the reason I like ICC is that I'm a clumsy player, and simply won't take the time to fiddle with the modal menus, especially for an ability that's 3-4 clicks in.  Sure, I can quickslot it but I am generally scrounging for slots as it is with my clerics.  I hate those pesky AOO's...<br><br>The other reason I took it was because the assassin bonus feats just don't blow my hair back--the extra dex isn't too appealling, since this guy will be marching around in full plate and toting a shield.  The only other assassin feat that I'd consider helpful to this build would be ESF: Move Silently, which may be the way to go with an SD sneaker in plate--I need all the bonuses I can get!<br><br>Given that ICC is an assassin epic bonus feat, I'dm love to hear suggestions how to get KD/IKD into this build without sacrificing in other ways (ie, lower saves, loss of AB, etc).  I couldn't see a way to do it without an unacceptable sacrifice.<br>_________________<br>Favorite PW's: Hall of the Worlds, Higher Ground, World of Iniquity.

one way would be to drop Stealthy and Combat Casting for both KD and IKD pre-epic.<br><br>Then drop ICC in epic for ESF: Move Silently.<br><br>This will give you a higher Move Silent by 8 points, but your Hide will drop by 2.<br><br>Personally I would also look for a way in which to increase your starting CON to 12 or 14, possibly at the expense of WIS and taking extra WIS during the life of the build up to 20.

Raising CON to 14 would raise it by +1, so perhaps dropping Epic Fortitude may be an option in this instance. (A net loss of 1 point to Fort). Just my personal opinion really.

If you have nice sneak damage and/or are in a high magic world, the weapon indeed doesnt matter as the base damage is of no importance.<br><br>YOu find yourself constantly rebuffing?  Hmm.  Divine fav does last only one turn (2 if extended <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ) but div power lasts 1rd/lv iirc.  THis gives you LOTS of time, esp if extended.  With all the cleric buffs, you should be takin down the monster quickly (maybe the dagger IS of consequence!!).  Trust me, I am constantly monitoring my div favs/prs battletides, prayers when I am in combat.   I find that concentration is all that is really needed.  ANd since you have HIPS you can easily steal away to buff then move back in.  I am not talkin about moving far away, just slightly out of reach.  My cleric has some tumble so i dont worry bout this at all as i wade in and out of combat.

Once your concentration is high enough the first check becomes unimportant since you'll always pass it.

This looks like a really cool build.  One thing I think it is missing, though, is evasion, which is, imo, one of the best of the easily cherry picked abilities, especially if you have a moderate or better Reflex save.  Your level split is certainly viable, but I would drop a cleric level to take SD 2 (dropping assassin levels isn't too attractive for the loss of a bonus feat/ death attack DC).  Level 9 spells are lost, but I think most players don't find them too impressive, and it puts a little less stress on your wisdom score, which opens up some other possibilities.<br>_________________<br>(I enjoy writing parenthetically (a lot)).

I'd take level 9 Cleric spells anytime instead of Evasion, you also get several spellslots. Evasion can be easily over-rated, it can be very useless with a low to medium Reflex save and in PvP you'll be snatched by IGMSs all the time, rendering it quite useless. Improved Evasion is a whole different story, as it works even on a failed save, the same problem happens against casters on PvP though.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 08/21/06 22:36</span></i></p>

In my experience with PvM, and yours may be different, there are quite a few monsters who spam a fairly low DC/ high damage area of effect that allows a reflex save (winter wolves, anyone?).  Watching the party fighter/ WM drop like a stone because he got caught in 5 at once while my Cleric/ Rogue takes no damage should be enough to convince anyone of the value of evasion.<br><br>The fact is, unless you have the Wisdom to make Storm of Vengeance worthwhile, I don't see anything on the Cleric's 9th level spell list that could translate to life or death  in the way that having evasion can.  Sure, having 9th level spells is preferrable to not having them, but the costs and benefits have to be weighed.  When you add in the lower stress on Wisdom score, and the fact that this can equate to +2 con at character creation, I think the Cleric 16/ SD 2 version wins out by a hair.<br><br>Just my 2 cents.<br>_________________<br>(I enjoy writing parenthetically (a lot)).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By koolthursday on 08/22/06 02:01</span></i></p>

A little known fact about that spell is not only does it give immunity to neg. energy, etc, it also gives +4 AC dodge bonus (not listed in the spell description).  Further, this bonus stacks with itself--meaning, you can cast it twice and get +8, etc, up to the +20 dodge bonus cap.  <br><br>I agree most of the other 9th level spells aren't that great, but also keep in mind that those slots can be used for metamagic'ed spells--stilled fire storms, for instance.  All in all, it's personal choice, but I'd personally take 9th level spells over Evasion every time.<br>_________________<br>Favorite PW's: Hall of the Worlds, Higher Ground, World of Iniquity.
