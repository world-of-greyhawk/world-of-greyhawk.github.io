(If craft wand taken - Put at least five points into craft weapon so you can get bones for wands). The rest are up to you. (I recommend put some into Tumble and Spot or Listen.)<br><br>Ok i got a thing about not liking human race so i dont use human, but if you wanted to make this a human then take a free feat at level 1 and i think lower dex and raise con would be the thing to do.

Someone is going to slap me really hard, because my suggestions are going to ruin some of the concept of this buid. I'd go as a dwarf and i would spread my ability points soemthing like this: STR 12 DEX 12 CON 16 WIS 18 WIS 8 CHA 6 Or keep str and dex at 10 and get 18 con too. I'd take level 20 as a fighter or rogue or bard or something else as a wizard. THis way you gain 1 more epic feat. I'd perhaps drop one epic focus and take Greater Int instead. COmbined with the other free epic feat, i could get 38 INT. YOu would gain some extra skillpoints to spend, +1 DC to all spells, a nice even number : D and 2 more spell slots at some level spell-levels. Not too huge, but still, its good.<br><br>You can slap me now!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By sheffnaster on 07/28/05 23:05</span></i></p>
