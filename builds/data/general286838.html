Thanks gal for beating me to it!!!<br><br>Forgotten world is a GREAT prc server.  It is partial implementing of PRC, as is, i believe ANY prc server has to be (the prc classes are very powerful so keeping balance on a server necessitates omitting certain things).<br><br>The server is where many of the great bioware epic builds were hatched.  Forgotten world has especially, a very good builders forum (using alot of the prc classes).  <br><br>I hope to see you there.  It is a friendly place, though it can be alittle hard in the beginning.  My suggestion is to bare with it cuz it is worth it!<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Thanks guys for the props :}<br><br>I play Dragon Mountian. It is nwn1 world with a custom Prc implementation and CEP2. We have over 1000 area, 5 cities, active guilds, and a slight RP flair. It is an action based server mostly, but the active Dms run rp based storylines.<br><br>we have eliminated several prc classes for balance, but mostly to eliminate lag or other technical issues. this is a very low lag server. We continue to look at opening other classes as well. <br><br>We have a Custom quest system and a 'token' system that allows the creation of custom items. You have multiple quests at each level beyond 5th and bosses at each level. Most levels have more than one boss so multiple runs to 40 do not mean you will face the same boss 2x.<br><br>We favor expert builds. it is a very hard world and will require a great build to solo, but it is a party based server so people will often switch chars to party with you. Many people have been on the world more than 3 years.<br><br><br>If you like the epic builds highlighted on these forums, we have a 40+ level castle area where most of these builds have been implemented for you to fight. A great way to test what you may consider the 'ultimate' build. I think you will find any build fully tested by the mountian. Can you climb to the top?<br><br>We just implemented a Capture the flag full PvP system as well for higher level chars.<br><br><a href="http://www.forgotten-worlds.net/forum/" target="_blank">http://www.forgotten-worlds.net/forum/</a><br><br>or <a href="http://www.forgotten-worlds.net/" target="_blank">http://www.forgotten-worlds.net/</a><br>_________________<br>no matter where you go, there you are!!!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By yyrkoon on 03/05/08 15:49</span></i></p>

Just so people are aware, the server that yrkoon and i referenced above is NO LONGER prc.  The apparent reason has to do with the incompatiblity of the prc with blah blah... <br><br>Since it is no longer PRC, i am most certain that there are other servers that would be a better time.  IOW, after 3 years of patronage, i no longer recommend the forgotten realms server.<br><br>SOrry for bringin up a dead post (as the warning above my subject screen tells me).  I can assume that a few people will still be lookin for PRC servers, so i wanted to make record of this rather recent turn.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/28/06 00:22:49 (GMT) -- TyrTemplar<br><br>This post is for general information purposes only, and does not constitute a legal opinion or render any legal advice.
