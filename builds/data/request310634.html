Ok this might be "outside the box" for some of you. I'm looking to max out AB and AC on the Iron Golem form "Construct Shape".<br><br>Bonus is your stats will start at:<br><br>Str 6<br>Dex 16<br>Con 14<br>Wis 22<br>Int 14 <br>Cha 6<br><br>AND! you will get an extra 12 ability points at lvl 40 to go to Dex or Wisdom. (Dex most likely since I'm looking for high AB)

You want AC? take a level of Monk and lots of Wisdom, you already need plenty wisdom for the iron shape and Monk's Wisdom AC won't be lost when caught flat-footed. You want AB? take any high BAB class pre-epic, but you can't do both at the same time.<br><br>A good amount of Druid levels also help to raise AC, a high level Owl's Insight and Barkskin work nicely and for a very long duration. So I'd recommend something like a Druid 24 / Shifter 13 / Monk 3.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Bonus is your stats will start at:<br><br>Str 6<br>Dex 16<br>Con 14<br>Wis 22<br>Int 14<br>Cha 6<br><br>AND! you will get an extra 12 ability points at lvl 40 to go to Dex or Wisdom.

Starting with 16 you can easily get it to about 26 or so and that +12 will make it 38. I'm at a loss however, I assume starting with 22 WIS is a subrace bonus but how do you get +12 at level 40?

Ok update:<br><br>I logged into the server and read up on druid/shifter changes.<br><br>Seems there was a new change I wasn't aware of, "properties from gloves will be added to your shape. (If no weapon equiped).<br><br>So from what I know so far. <br><br>1. Armor, Helm, and Shield merge. (And gloves because of server change)<br>2. Weapon Finesse works with unarmed shapes. <br>3. Epic Prowess Helps AB shifted by 1.<br><br>Question : In NWNwiki says that for the Iron Golem the Items merge (Items are both ring slots, amulet slot, cloak slot, boots slot, and belt slot.)<br>So does this mean anything on these merge, like Fort saves, abilities boost etc.

sorry bout the double post.  Not sure why that happened.  Maybe a mod can take one out.<br><br>What i meant by the Yes No is that you are correct and you arent!  I thought i answered that, but..<br><br>No the dex isnt overridden in Iron GOl shape. NO, more str added WITHOUT items wont increase AB.<br><br>YES, no matter how much you raise dex you will not affect ab with finesse (unless you go over 33, and then you cant get iron gol).  <br><br>In a world where you get +12 ontop of 40, i am not sure a shifter is worth the effort.  It will probably be a high magic world and the shapes just dont have the kick for it.<br><br>hope that helps

It's not that weapon finesse will not affect AB, rather, your AB is modified by the largest modifier, and if your STR score is bigger than your DEX score then why bother with Weapon Finesse?<br><br>There are other good variants, say, raise Charisma and take Blackguard or Paladin as your third class, you'll get great saving throws.<br><br>One thing that's certain is that you need to play the shift before anything else. Build it up in single player, start as level 40 if you wish and try a module or something, in-game experience usually works better than only suggestions, I can tell you what class split I'd use, why and how I use it, that doesn't mean you'll be me when you play it. I know how to build a shifter, but I don't know the details of the Iron Golem shape as I've never used it. What items merge, for example, is something that should be tested IMO. I can only suggest you to take a big amount of Druid levels to improve your buffs and add variety to your fighting options with spells. Monk will net the highest AC of all secondary classes. I'd say you should try the DEX version and see how it ends, then make the STR version and compare the stats, you'll get tested results in just a few minutes.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Thanks so much for all of your help guys. I have been building shifters and reading faqs about them for 2 weeks now. I didn't wanna go with the dragon form so I chose iron golem.
