Bard 14/Champion of Torm 10/Palemaster 16<br><br>This is a hybrid of Mauvais Guillame’s Haunted Hymnsinger of Torm &amp; Mithdradates Doom Skald. <br>This is my 1st Epic Build so feedback will be appreciated.<br><br>Basically, He’s got a good AC, decent AB, and decent saves, plus all those PM immunities. However, HP’s are on the low side. (Possibly, lose the great strength for epic toughness, and shift the Cha ability point into strength?)<br><br>Race Elf<br>Alignment CN<br><br>Starting (Bard)<br><br>Str 16 (26) +9 ability points<br>Dex 10<br>Con 12<br>Wis 8<br>Int 14<br>Cha 15 (16) +1 ability point<br><br><br>Leveling - Feats<br><br>1 Bard – Cursed Song <br>2 Bard <br>3 Bard – Lingering Song<br>4 Bard<br>5 Bard<br>6 Bard - Toughness<br>7 Bard <br>8 Bard<br>9 Bard – Weapon Focus (longsword)<br>10 Bard<br>11 CoT<br>12 CoT – Extend Spell, Power Attack<br>13 CoT<br>14 CoT - Cleave<br>15 CoT – Improved Critical (longsword)<br>16 CoT – Great Cleave<br>17 CoT<br>18 CoT – Knockdown, Improved Knockdown<br>19 Bard<br>20 Bard<br>21 Bard – Epic Weapon Focus (longsword)<br>22 Palemaster<br>23 Palemaster<br>24 Palemaster – Armor Skin<br>25 Palemaster<br>26 Palemaster<br>27 Palemaster – Epic Prowess<br>28 CoT<br>29 CoT – Heavy Armor<br>30 Palemaster – Overwhelming Critical (longsword)<br>31 Palemaster<br>32 Palemaster<br>33 Palemaster - Great Strength<br>34 Palemaster<br>35 Palemaster<br>36 Palemaster – Devastating Critical (longsword), Energy Resistance (acid)<br>37 Palemaster<br>38 Palemaster<br>39 Palemaster – 2 Epic Spells: Mage Armor &amp; Warding<br>40 Bard<br><br><br>Ending<br><br>Skills (Rough numbers)<br>Concentration 40<br>Discipline 40<br>Listen 5<br>Perform 21<br>Spellcraft 40<br>Spot 5<br>Tumble 43<br>UMD 25<br><br><br>HP 383 <br>(I believe this is maxed, however, I ran into a problem with the palemaster’s deathless vigor not adding during some level ups)<br><br><br>AC 30 (naked)<br>     41 (Basic full plate &amp; tower shield)<br>     60 + (with Epic Mage armor, Bard Song, &amp; Buffs)<br><br>AB 27<br>+39/34/29/24 (with basic longsword)<br><br>Saves … start/end<br><br>Fort (1) 26<br>Reflex (2) 29<br>Will (1) 24<br><br>Thanks!

This is the right forum for tweaking builds yet in progress, your other topic in the Epic Builds page will be deleted, since it's only for complete and tested builds.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 06/23/06 18:55</span></i></p>

If this is a PvP build, I'd take Epic Fire resistance instead of Acid, since more weapons have flame on them (flameblade/darkfire) than acid.  Acid Sheath is more common than the fire circle one tho.

Drop starting DEX to 8 and raise CON to 14. You can cover the 2 point DEX loss with a spell, scroll, or potion of Cat's Grace or a DEX-boosting item.<br><br>*edit* Other tweaks:<br><br>Move Wepaon Focus earlier (I'd take it at level 3, move Curse Song to level 6, take Lingering at level 1, and Toughness to level 9).<br><br>I'd also take Heavy Armor a lot sooner (is it even available as a CoT bonus feat?). Perhaps at level 12, moving Power Attact to level 14, Cleave to 16, and Great Cleave to 29.<br><br>Switch Bard to level 22 and take your first PM level at level 21. This will allow you to top up Tumble to 25 ranks, netting you an extra AC point a lot earlier in the build.<br><br>Take only 40 ranks in Tumble, since the AC boost is calculated from base ranks. Put those 3 points into Discipline.<br><br>You can shave 3 points off Perform, since you only need 21 modified ranks to support your level 14 Bard Song and you've got +3 bonus from CHA.<br><br>The bonus to saves vs spells works on modified ranks, so take 43 Spellcraft for a modified score of 45 or +9 vs spells. Or, you could take 41 ranks if you want to rely on your Bard Song to boost it (with your INT modifier and +2 to skills from Bard Song, that's 45 modified ranks).<br><br>I'd take only ranks in Listen <i>or</i> Spot, not both. May as well have one semi-decent score as opposed to two poor ones. Althoug, since you'll be immune to crits, you may not need either of those skills and could drop a point into Open Lock and Disable Traps and a few into Search for some versatility.<br><br>For the energy resistance feat at PM level 13, you may want to consider Fire, as that's probably the most common element you run into. Acid's not a bad choice either though.<br><br>One last note: PM's Deathless Vigor only adds 3 HPs per level of PM, not per character level (and I'm not sure if they're retroactive to previous PM levels). After PM level 10, you get +5 HPs every 5th level (so at PM 15, 20, 25, and 30 you'll get an extra 5 HPs and not the +3 you got in each of the previous pre-epic levels). This may be the oddness you were noticing when levelling.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 06/23/06 21:13</span></i></p>
