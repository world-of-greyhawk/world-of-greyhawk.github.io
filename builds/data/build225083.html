Kail made some great comments... might want to consider Bard 20/druid 17/monk 3.  That gets you 9th level druid spells (elemental swarm is a good one for a dragon build) and the monk move speed bonus.<br><br>Another thing to consider is that starting at level 21 your character is going to have an exp penalty because you're using 3 base classes.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

KD and IKD are almost a must for Dragon Shape. <br><br>Don't bother with Lingering Song, as you have Lasting Inspiration in already. <br><br>The only downside I see is a low bunch of HP. I wonder if its possible to drop 2 points from WIS at startup and pump CON to 14 and CHA to 15. That way you only need to take 1 CHA later on. <br><br>Just tested this and it is possible, but only by taking EWF Unarmed and Lasting Inspiration late on and there is no room for Epic Prowess. But you gain 2 points to your Fort save and 80 HP. still just a thought.<br><br>BTW I would take at the very least 1 point in Lore, by doing this you have 26 ranks through Bardic Knowledge.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 12/26/05 21:45</span></i></p>

Ah! I left improved crit there.  I did take knockdown there instead.

My argument on Parry would be that you trade your Monk attack schedule for 3 Parry attempts that <b>might</b> block the enemy's attack and <b>might</b> result in a riposte attack. Effectively you lose (assuming Haste and Flurry) 4 attacks for little gain.<br>_________________<br>Surely, without war there would be no loss - hence, no mourning, no grief, no pain, no misery...

With only 31 ranks in parry and low dex you are not gonna bock that many attacks, the <br>DC being the modified attack roll that hits you. You are much better of with IE<br><br><i>Edit</i>: assuming one would want to use parry, he'd have to build a dexer to be successful with it, being parry a dex based skill.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 12/26/05 22:38</span></i></p>

I guessed so, dragon shape gives you 36 dex. If where you play you find parry is useful, then max it out. You are missing 12 points there, which is a lot the way parry works.<br><br>I still think that you give up too much for those three possible "dodges" and the even less possible riposte, as Finn points out. Just buff up, change into dragon, knock 'em down and beat them up. They shouldn't last long <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Yes he would, but looking closer it would cost to much. Getting EWF and LS at lvl 39 and 40, and giving up epic prowess altogether. That ain't worth getting 40 hp's for. Disregard. To much food in these days slow my brain down.....

I tried this and found I liked Bard 20/Druid 17/Monk 3 instead.  Bard 20 for lingering.  Druid 17 for mass heals.  Monk 3 for a little monk speed.

Cause IKD should give you anyhow a bonus vs the discipline skill check the one you try to knock down has to make, which can be useful when fighting high STR fighter with ESF: discipline

WF (unarmed) feats DO NOT WORK with dragon shape. check the combat log, not the character screen.  only improved critical (unarmed) has any effect on dragon shape (and epic prowess).  also keep in mind the changes in str due to shifting and the fact that the dragon has +6 claws.  <br><br>the best way to test is to make the same build twice. #1 taking wf feats and #2 without and compare the resulting ab.

That's very bad news... did they fix that only for shifter forms then?

I don't think they fixed anything. weapon focus and such work with forms that use weapons (drider, risen lord, etc...). any unarmed forms use creature weapons and not fists, so the feats don't apply.  I'm not sure the logic behind improved critical, but it does work for some reason.

I read somewhere it got fixed, but you are right it did not. The character sheet shows the AB with WF/EWF but the combat log shows that it does not work. Oh well, that means two feats to change...
