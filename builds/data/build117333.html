ive started this build on the three towns server, a relatively tough, low magic server.  im lvl 13 right now and very happy with the damage this guy is dealing but im worried about his survivability.  hes has to be quite careful already with his 30AC and 124 health and soloing is not an option as i take to much dmg.  in parties im the damage dealer along with WMs and mages.  <br><br>since im meelee i doubt that my AC and low health will cut it when high critting monsters become more often.  i can already see myself now, dying on end.<br><br>so my question, does this build survive well enough at high levels to play it on a low magic/tough server?

Looks like an awesome build, I'm assuming the race is Human?<br><br>PS: I really like the Ov. Crit and Dev. Crit at level 21 and 22 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

If you took only 7 lvls of RDD before lvl 20 and did a 4 bard/7 RDD/9 fighter, you could get overwhelming and devastating crit both at lvl 21 and add 1 more to your final BaB (17 STR + 5 from lvl increases + 4 from RDD = 26 STR at 21;  BaB at 20 for your build--3 from 4 bard + 7 from 10 RDD + 6 from 6 fighter = 16; BaB from my suggestion--3 from 4 bard + 5 from 7 RDD + 9 from 9 fighter = 17)  <br><br>This would sacrifice the Epic Toughness you take with your last bonus fighter feat, but 20 hit points for 1 more AB is a trade I would make every time.  I would most likely take something else with that feat anyway.  <br><br>To be honest, I would most likely do a 7 bard/4 RDD/9 fighter before 20 anyway. I like my bard abilities, and the sooner you get 3rd lvl spells, the soner you can keen your greatsword. That is a personal preference, and really has nothing to do with your build.  Just thought I would throw that out there.<br><br>These are just my suggestions.  You can use them or ignore them as you wish <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.rpgmods.net/forgottenworlds/phpBB2/" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

Thanks for giving credit first off Urgos....<br><br>I like this build even in a tough low magic server because you get the essential ghostly visage for low lvls, and eventually improved invis.  You may want to swap to a shield/sword combo for a low magic server, but otherwise, due to bard spells/buffs, I don't see why it wouldn't fare just as well short of criticals being so nasty on the server every meleer needs PM lvls.<br><br>The revised builds I've been using have ftr 5/rdd 8/bard 7 as its pre-epic lvling.  This is mainly to use the ftr bonus feats for damage reduction if I need to tank, as well as the standard focus/specialization.  And since the server I play on has dev crit disabled, the pre-epic ftr feats are largely a waste.<br><br>Mostly I love this build for the fact you have bard buffs/spells to complement your melee abilties.  Improved invis as mentioned before, along with greater magic weapon, keen edge, warcry, and the stat buffs, even in a high magic world, it is nice to be able to use other items instead of always needing to find a keen, +5 greatsword or whatever.<br>_________________<br>I may not be able to get an erection, but at least I have enough balls not to hack.

Looks quite nice, but given that the char has dev crit fairly early on, I would probably go with a scim and shield for increased threat range and the AC boost from the shield.

I also play on 3 towns and dev crit are disabled and you really need to use a shield. Should I take wpn focus scimitar? Is there another wpn that is better with shield?<br><br>I like to play in parties but would like the option of playing solo whenever I want.

I have no knowledge of 3 towns server items but i believe Kukri / Scimitar / Rapier all have the biggest crit range with or without WM levels.

Well if dev crit is disabled and you can afford exotic weapon prof, then that opens up scythe for 2 handed weapons and dwarven waraxe as a one hander as well as the bastard sword and Katana, although the last 2 really aren't that much different from a longsword ultimately.
