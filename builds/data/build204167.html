<b>Playable from levels 1-40... PvM build</b><br><br>Hopefully this build will be popular with the Dwarf fans.  One of the big problems with Most Dwarven Defenders is the Low AB, so I set out to make a Dwarven Defender that had a good AB by adding Weapon Master Levels.  The end result is a good tank build; it isn't pretty, it doesn't have any tricks up its sleeves, but it can take a hell of a pounding and dish one out as well.  This build works the best in a low to mid magic setting where devastating critical is banned.  Preferably he can be part of a party where his weaknesses can be compensated for by other party members.  Oddly enough, with mind spell protection he makes a good scout.  Not because he's sneaky, but because very few things can kill him before he can retreat. <br><br>There are a few similar builds, including <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "198936", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>one</a> by Rooker1963 that has the same level distribution.  This build does not have devasating critical and either has a higher AB or a higher DR than the other DwD/WM builds. When you throw in the little perks like improved knockdown and blind-fight, I felt that this build was unique enough to post (had I searched for this level combination before making the build I probably would not have built it).  Whether it is better or worse than the other builds I will leave to the community to decide.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-High AB.  A 45 AB is pretty good for a Dwarven Defender.<br>-17-20 critical threat range on an X4 multiplier bludgeoning weapon.  The 100+ point critical hits are almost as good as devastating critical. <br>-18 points of damage reduction and over 700 hit points.  He can take a good deal of punishment. Watching a dex build try to take him down is entertaining.<br>-Good Fortitude Save.  He should be safe against most Death Magic.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br><br>-No spell casting ability.  Melee is his only form of attack.<br>-Mediocre reflex and low will save. The Reflex save isn't that bad.  If he fails his save he takes damage and he can absorb a good deal of that.  The will save can be problematic, hopefully he can find some way to defend himself from mind spells.<br><br><b>Dwarven Landslide</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Dwarf<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Any Lawful <br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 16<br>DEX 14<br>CON 17<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 6<br><br><i>Leveling Guide</i><br>Levels 1-8 Fighter<br>Levels 9-17 Dwarven Defender<br>Levels 18-20 Weapon Master<br>Levels 21-22 Fighter<br>Level 23 Dwarven Defender<br>Levels 24-36 Weapon Master<br>Levels 37-40 Dwarven Defender<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Dwarven Defender 14<br>Fighter 10<br>Weapon Master 16<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>4, 8, 12 and 16 go to CON<br>20, 24, 28, 32, 36 and 40 go to STR<br><br><i>Feats</i><br>Level 1: Toughness, Weapon Focus (Warhammer)<br>Level 2: Expertise<br>Level 3: Dodge<br>Level 4: Weapon Specialization (Warhammer)<br>Level 6: Knockdown, Mobility<br>Level 8: Improved Knockdown<br>Level 9: Improved Critical (Warhammer) <br>Level 12: Spring Attack<br>Level 15: Whirlwind Attack<br>Level 18: Blind-Fight<br>Level 21: Epic Weapon Focus (Warhammer)<br>Level 22: Epic Weapon Specialization (Warhammer)<br>Level 24: Epic Prowess<br>Level 27: Great Constitution I<br>Level 30: Great Strength I<br>Level 33: Great Strength II, Damage Reduction I<br>Level 36: Great Strength III, Damage Reduction II<br>Level 39: Great Strength IV<br>Level 40: Damage Reduction III<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 26<br>DEX 14<br>CON 22<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 6<br><br><i>Final Saves</i> (vs. spells)<br>Fortitude 29 (35)<br>Reflexes 20 (26)<br>Will 18 (24)<br><br><i>AB and Damage</i><br>(No buffs, mundane Warhammer)<br>45/40/35/30 14+1D8 (17-20 X4)<br><br>(+12 STR, +5 keen Warhammer)<br>56/51/46/41 25+1D8 (16-20 X4)<br><br><i>AC</i><br>26 (27) (No buffs, mundane full plate and tower shield)<br>54 (55) (Defensive Stance, Boots of Speed, +5 full plate, +5 tower shield, +5 ring of protection, +5 amulet of natural armor) <br><br>18 points of damage reduction<br><br><i>Hit Points</i> 708 (maximum every level)<br><br><i>Final Skillpoints</i> 172<br>Discipline 43 (51)<br>Intimidate 6 (4)<br>Spellcraft 18 (20)<br>Spot 43 (42)<br>Tumble 20 (21)<br><br><i>Skillpoint Distribution</i><br>Level 1: Discipline 4, Intimidate 2, Spellcraft 2, Tumble 2<br>Level 2: Discipline 1, Save 3<br>Level 3: Discipline 1, Intimidate 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 4: Discipline 1, Save 3<br>Level 5: Discipline 1, Intimidate 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 6: Discipline 1, Save 3<br>Level 7: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1, Save 2<br>Level 8: Discipline 1, Save 5<br>Level 9: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Spot 4, Tumble 1<br>Level 10: Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 2<br>Level 11: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Spot 1, Tumble 1 <br>Level 12: Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 2<br>Level 13: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Spot 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 14: Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 2<br>Level 15: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Spot 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 16: Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 2<br>Level 17: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Spot 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 18: Discipline 1, Intimidate 2, Spot 1<br>Level 19: Discipline 1, Spot 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 20: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Spot 1 <br>Level 21: Discipline 1, Tumble 1, Save 1<br>Level 22: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 2<br>Level 23: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Spot 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 24: Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 2<br>Level 25: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Spot 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 26: Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 2<br>Level 27: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Spot 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 28: Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 2<br>Level 29: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Spot 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 30: Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 2<br>Level 31: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Spot 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 32: Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 2<br>Level 33: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Spot 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 34: Discipline 1, Spot 2, Save 1<br>Level 35: Discipline 1, Spot 2, Tumble 1<br>Level 36: Discipline 1, Spot 2, Save 1<br>Level 37: Discipline 1, Spot 2, Tumble 1<br>Level 38: Discipline 1, Spot 3<br>Level 39: Discipline 1, Spot 3<br>Level 40: Discipline 1, Spot 3<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Excellent, Mith.  I remembered Rooker's being a decent build, but I have to admit that this one is more appealing if only because of the 14Int at the start.  Veyr efficient stat distribution.  Works for me, but (looking over the build) I don't see any Assassin levels....an oversight perhaps? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"><br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

There is supposed to be <i>blunt</i> property that has the same effect as <i>keen</i>.  But the NWN developers, being computer programmers and ipso facto lazy (Honestly, have you ever met a computer programmer that wasn't a little lazy?  Must be a personality trait of the people attracted to that profession, or a side effect of spending all that time infront of a computer.), only implemented the keen property but it applies to all weapons.  The <i>keen edge</i> spell only works on slashing weapons, as it should.  The early rapiers, which I suppose the D&amp;D rapiers are, would have been heavier than what we think of as a rapier* and would have had a cutting edge so it should probably be a slashing/piercing weapon, hence the keen edge spell should probably work on it.<br><br>*=Fencing had not yet evolved and the war swords of the time were still heavy enough to breach armor, so most sword training would have favored a heavy swing.  Metallurgy, though it had improved due to the Islamic techniques gained from the Crusades, would also have dictated a heavier blade. The blade would still have probably have been light enough to break if tried to parry the heavier blades (IIRC, the Bastard sword was still being used when the Rapier was first developed).  The blade also would have been straight instead of the silly curved NWN models.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Chip: I can't think of anything that's changed that would affect this build. Still a solid build.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

Hey if anyone can answer this it would be appreciated.<br><br>Got a question on two things....<br><br>1.  Why the 2 points of intimidate at level 18?  Why is that needed when we have already qualified for WM?<br><br>2.  Does Epic Prowess stack with all the AB feats like Weapon Focus?  I thought it didnt or read that here on the Bioware boards.  Can someone confirm that for me please.<br><br>Thanks

Yes, it stacks.

Thanks Kali for the quick response.<br><br>Mith,<br><br>Thanks for another outstanding build.  I am playing this on a high magic server and so far I am having a blast.  When I make it to level 40, I will give a critique of the build PvM and PvP.

An update...<br><br>PvM the character rocks... I breeze through monsters like a hot knife through butter<br><br>Epic Boss Monsters... the character does ok<br><br>PvP the character is found lacking against very high AC foes... since the character is one dimensional (melee based) he is hard pressed to be effective if his main weapon can not hit.

it would also have difficulty against chars with ED and SC also, particularly if they have HIPS as well.

Sorry, it was 3:45 am and instead of resting my brain, I got mixed up with a different build that I had a question about.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  <br><br>Anyhoo, it's good to see the builders are still larger than life (well, not really, but you get my jest) even in the lurking doom of the approaching NWN2.<br><br>Thanks again for this build submission, I still use it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Regards,<br>Chip<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By chipelp3 on 10/12/06 10:48</span></i></p>
