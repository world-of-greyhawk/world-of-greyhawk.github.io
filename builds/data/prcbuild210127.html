Well, I'm glad to see my build inspired you to create a version to fit your needs.  Just a few comments:<br><br>First of all, going Monk(9)/Cleric(5)/Sacred Fist(6) pre-epic is not a good idea.  You are hurting your BAB quite a bit by doing that.  In general, when multiclassing classes which get 3 BAB every 4 levels, like monk and cleric, it's a good idea to stick to multiples of 4 levels of those classes as much as possible.  That's because the level after a multiple of 4 always gives you 0 BAB.  In this case, you took 1 level beyond the multiple for <b>both</b> classes, which is the worst thing you can do for your BAB.  Monk(9)/Cleric(5)/Sacred Fist(6) gives you a BAB at level 20 of 15, and a final BAB of 25 at level 40.  If instead you went Monk(6)/Cleric(4)/Sacred Fist(10) pre-epic, at level 20 you'd have a BAB 17, and a final BAB of 27 at level 40.  Every point of AB is important, and it's not a good idea to waste them for no reason.<br><br>Secondly, it's also generally not a good idea to take all of one class, then all of another, then all of the 3rd class in a row like you did.  You get a more balanced character when you combine your levels more.  This is especially true in this build, because every level of Sacred Fist is, in all important ways, basically the same as getting a level of both monk and cleric at once.  If you want to make monk 6 come earlier for Improved Knockdown, that makes sense.  But otherwise, you're better off taking your 10 pre-epic Sacred Fist levels as early as possible.  There's really no benefit to waiting, and quite a bit of benefit to taking them early.<br><br>Finally, you get 162 skill points with this build.  That's simply not enough.  As a melee build, you need Discipline.  You're going to want Tumble 40 for the AC.  You'll want Concentration as a caster (and you need a minumum of 25 to get Improved Combat Casting anyway).  Also, since this is a PRC build, you need high Spellcraft in order to learn epic spells (and you'll want it for the saves anyway) and Lore gives you castings per day.  That's why I took the epic skill focuses for both of them.  Maxing all of those skills (well, tumble to 40) would require 212 skill points.  I would drop STR to 12 and raise INT to 12, and then you'll have 205 skill points, and you can get:<br><br>Concentration 36<br>Discipline 43<br>Lore 43<br>Spellcraft 43<br>Tumble 40<br><br>Hope that helps <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  .<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 08/26/05 19:35</span></i></p>

Intuitive attack is not so good. The wisdom AB is applied as as a bonus, and counts towards the +20 cap. You already have +14 from wisdom. Throw in buffs, spells, and gloves, and you've hit the cap quite fast.

I have a quick question about the caster levels from Sacred Fist - it says that you get more castings per day but do NOT learn new spells. Since you only have 5 cleric levels, if it works as stated you should only have access to spells of level 3 or below. Is the description in the PRC manual incorrect? Do you gain access to the higher level spells by levelling as a Sacred Fist, in addition to the effective caster level and casts per day?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>TM

Thanks. <br><br>In that case, one other question - it also says that sacred fist level stacks with monk level for unarmed damage. Does it by any chance also stack with monk level for other monk abilities (AC, SR, or quivering palm DC)? In other words, would it be worthwhile to take 12 monk levels to pick up Diamond Soul? Would the final SR be 22 (12+10) or 45 (12 monk levels + 23 SF levels + 10)? I am asking because if the game handles it as a single flag (monk level/not monk level), SD may count as monk levels for all feats (although they may not grant the feats themselves).<br><br>TM

No. <br><br>Sacred Fist does however have it's own progression for AC and and speed increases, which adds to whatever you have from monk levels. The SR from Sacred fist is a static ability. The DC of stunning fist is based on character level IIRC, not monk level.

I know this is an old thread but I've recently began playing the PRC and wanted to make a monk/cleric/SF.  My question is why do you go CL 5?  If SF adds spells as if you leveled in CL then why don't you just go CL 1?  This is the first CL I'd be playing so pardon my question because I know I'm missing something here.  Thanks.

Your not missing anything.  you need only 1 cl lvl to qual for sf.  SF being a prc you can only get 10 pre epic, so that means more monk or more cleric.  cleric makes the spells tougher, monk gives some stuff, its up to you.  you dont have to ask about my preferences!!  lol
