I like the build!<br><br>You ask for feedback. There are only minor issues.<br><br>You add 3 to dex and 17 to wis. You take g.dex II and G.wis VII. That only gives 19 ability points to spend.<br><br>I'd take the ninth monk lvl at clvl 17. This will give tumble 20 before the epic lvls.<br><br>I'd only take great dex I, and end at dex 14. I'd take e. toughness or e. reflexes (to boost improved evasion) as the last bonus feat.<br><br>I'd only take great wis VI, and end at wis 34. The last general feet can be used to take toughness (con is only 10), blind fight, armor skin or called shot.<br><br>I think I would skip concentration and rather take spot.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

More interesting then actually powerful - switching dexterity with wisdom would give you the same AB and AC, one free feat and slightly different saving throws and skill ranks. unless you have many druid friends, who could boost your wisdom to insane numbers.

One problem with having a lot of dex based AC is that you don't have uncanny dodge.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

point of this class was making a archer using zen archery using monk levels cuz cleric zen archery is over used on my server.  Also the server items gives me +12 on all my stats <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>so with ability boost from server items I get stat of:<br>22 str<br>28 dex<br>22 Con<br>24 Int<br>47 Wis<br>20 Cha<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Aretal on 04/15/05 18:36</span></i></p>

You are starting with an 18 wis and ending with an odd wis score.  I would either start with a 14 dex, 17 wis and 12 con, or a 17 wis and 16 dex, or I would drop one of the Great Wisdom feats.  If you are getting +12 to all stats, the extra point of Wisdom will do you no good since you are not a caster.<br><br>I would consider dropping one point of int as well, sticking it in dex, since you will only have one lvl of spells, but I like having the extra skill point as well, so I wouldn't sweat it either way.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.rpgmods.net/forgottenworlds/phpBB2/" target="_blank">Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Yar Stardawg on 04/15/05 20:17</span></i></p>
