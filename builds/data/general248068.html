I was wondering if anyone could suggest a friendly, easy-to-use PW that features a good mix of RP, quests, party play, etc. that allows for fairly easy and rapid leveling.<br><br>I play a lot of modules, but haven't been able to find a PW that offers what I'm looking for.  Some are too RP-heavy, or very cumbersome to play on, while others are so hack-n-slash or PVP that it isn't worth the time.<br><br>I appreciate your suggestions, and thanks in advance.

I finally found a pw that I really love.  ITs calld Forgotten world (we call it the mountain).  It has an AMAZIN weapon "craft" system, the lvlin is pretty decent and it is designed for party play so rp is there if you like.   PM me if you would like the info.<br><br>OOPS!   Forgot one minor, rather IMPORTANT thing: you have to download the PRC (and cep) to play there.  Not all the prc classes are open, but the spells are whats fun (especially for clerics <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">  )   What this means is that if you are planning a PM, for example, prc has set qualin for it to actually having to cast 3rd lv spells (arcane), so no cleric/bard4s/pm 16s  !!<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 07/27/06 22:48</span></i></p>
