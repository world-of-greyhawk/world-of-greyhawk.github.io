Clangeddin's Savage Harper<br>Fighter 18, Barbarian 17, Harper Scout 5<br>1-40 PvM<br>Dwarf<br><br>A new twist on the Harper Scout class introduced to the guild, the first to combine with the Barbarian class.

You might want to try for a work around to get more than 20 barbarian levels.  As I recall, terrifying rage doesn't work against opponents whose level is greater than twice your barbarian levels.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
