Can really easily add Dev Crit - just drop Epic Prowess and move Armor Skin to replace one of the Improved SR's, and you've got it (move the 5th and 6th CoT levels up to take it at level 28). COsts you 2 AC and 2SR, or 2 Str if you drop Gr Str feats instead. If you don't want Dev Crit, you could also drop Power Attack and Great Cleave pre-epic for feats of your choice. You could also take the first CoT levels earlier if you want, I held off to reach Monk level 16 ASAP for unarmed damage. The build will also work as a human, for some more skill points and another feat (although you are not tight for feats on this one at all). This one gets a final SR of 44, not enough for a true mage-killer but more than adequate for PvM. If you want to specialize on mages or use it for PvP, I recommend dropping a few Gr. Str. feats for more Improved SR. You can also drop the last 2 CoT levels for Monk levels, effectively trading 2 AC from Armor Skin for 2 more SR. You can get SR up to 58, dropping Str to 26 and AC by 2.<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 01/09/06 20:48</span></i></p>

BTW, the unarmed version was play-tested through the Aielund series to level 25, then into the Sands of Fate series up to level 35, all on hardcore setting. Aielund was moderately tough until level 6 or so, fairly smooth sailing from then on. Sands of Fate was surprisingly easy, given it's design as a high-level mod. Only a few of the bosses gave him any difficulty.<br><br>TM

Since you metion that it's kinda tough lvling this build till 6th lvl, 4 FTR lvls preepic, getting WS preepic, instead of CoT  and taken early in you rcareer (lvls 2-5) would give you a higher survivability at low lvls. <br>Also, you mention you could take more CoT lvls and you say that would hurt your AB.

Yes, like any str-based build, he is item-dependent for AC. In Aielund, by level 25 he had an AC of about 43 (all +5 items). In Sands of Fate, he got up to about 70 (+8 to +10 items). In HoTU, I think it's around 65-67. Generally around 9-10 less than a dex-based build, but I think it's worth it for the offensive capability. Even with super-duper AC, live enemies will hit you 1 time in 20. Dead ones never hit....<br><br>TM

I've tried it, and I was getting my butt handed to me.  Part of the problem is that low AC coupled with no Uncanny Dodge makes a world of difference at that level.  It's quite common to get tag-teamed.  Therefore, even if strength-based, you have to play the Monk like a finesse Rogue.  Flank, stealth, run, etc....<br><br>Taking 4 fighter levels right away is a 2 edged sword.

Yes. I handled it by taking along Nellise - she did decently in melee, generally distracting enough enemies to prevent too much flanking, and the healing and buffs made a big difference at that level. I particularly remember a certain pair of halflings in a house that killed me when I tried to take them on alone, but they were easy with a henchie (2 rogues - so 1 was always doing sneak damage solo). I was only level 2 or 3 at the time, so it didn't take many 2d6 sneaks to finish me off...<br><br>Of course, in the beginning there really isn't much difference between str-based and dex-based. In this build, I start with 16 str and 14 dex. It's not till level 8 that that even increases to 18 and 14, so you're only talking about +1 to AC for a dex build vs. str build (or +1 to damage for the str build). Later on it becomes significant, but not right away.<br><br>TM
