I play on a roleplay server where the "assassin" class is only available through a guild which requires an 8 in disable traps, a cross-class skill for rangers, so I plan to get 1 level of rogue at level 8 to dump the extra points into disable traps. I will need enough levels of ranger to get an animal companion, and not a lot of levels of assassin since my primary purpose in taking the class is entrance into the guild.<br>Additionally, there's a rule on the server that someone with a perma-deathed character is allowed to make a new character of that level, up to 7, so I will be starting at level 7. After 7th level I will need to be able to survive in a difficult environment with low experience.<br>Thanks for your help <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>P.S. Anyone who can make this work with shurikens is awesome and deserves a cookie <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">
