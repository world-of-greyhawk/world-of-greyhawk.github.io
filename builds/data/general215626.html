How does these work? I know you raise your BAB to that of a fighter. Say a 20 cleric with BAB 5 casts it, he gets 5 better BAB, but will that raise of 5 count towards the +20 cap or not? And another thing. With +12 to Strength from items, will Divine Power still raise your strength from 10 to 18?

Incidentally, if that raise in BAB would mean another attack, the Cleric gets that attack at full BAB. So, a pure level 20 CLC with BAB +15 has (ignoring any bonuses to AB):<br><br>+15/+10/+5 attack schedule.<br><br>After casting Divine Power, he gets:<br><br>+20/+15/+10/+20<br><br>Nice, huh? That's why it's sometimes desirable for a battle Cleric to not have BAB +16 or better by level 20.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;And another thing. With +12 to Strength from items, will Divine Power still raise your strength from 10 to 18?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>No, becuase if you're wearing items that give you +12 to STR, your STR can't be boosted further by any magical means.<br><br>Example: if your STR is 10, and you're wearing +12 items, then your current STR is 22. Divine Power will have no effect on your STR since it's already boosted to the max.<br><br>Ignoring items, if you cast DP and raise your STR to 18 from 10, then cast Bull's, your STR can be boosted further (but not beyond the +12 cap). This could result in a possible STR of 19 to 22. However, if you cast Bull's first, then DP, your STR will not boost beyond 18.<br><br>Similarly, if you have items that boost your STR from 10 to 17, DP will raise your STR to 18 only.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...
