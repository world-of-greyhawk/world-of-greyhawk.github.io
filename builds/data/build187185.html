A while back, Crispy Critter helped me out with making a woodsman build. This is a mix of his advice and help as well others (i.e. Syrath, the champion of SC). I tried to combine weapon excellence (WM) with sneakiness (Rogue) plus a dash of Self Concealment. One major weakness is the bad saves.<br><br>This is a dual wielding hand axe fella with 4 attacks per round.<br><br>Name: Woodsman<br>Race: Halfling<br><br>--------------------------<br>     FINAL BUILD <br>--------------------------<br><br>CLASSES:<br> - Ranger (2)<br> - Rogue (25)<br> - Weapon Master (13)<br><br>ABILITIES:<br>  Str: 10<br>  Dex: 20 (32)<br>  Con: 10<br>  Int: 13<br>  Wis: 11 (12)<br>  Cha: 08<br>STATISTICS:<br>  Hit Points: 231<br>  AC: 29<br>  Will Save: 17<br>  Fort.

Hmmm... I might have missed something but here is what I think<br><br><br>1) I don't see a reason to take Ranger at level one!<br>Take Rogue instead then you don't need to have 11 in WIS. <br>Take Ranger at level 2 instead.<br><br>Change start stats to<br>Str: 10<br>Dex: 20 only raise this.<br>Con: 12<br>Int: 14<br>Wis: 08<br>Cha: 08<br><br>2) I don't see the use for the second Ranger level!<br>It doesn't help your AB and you don't gain any special abilities.

1) Good point. Never thought of that. I was making this character with playability from 1 to 40 in mind and I wanted to get him started straight away with his dual wield hand axes. But, lvl 2 would have made more sense. Thanks.<br><br>2) The 2nd Ranger level: This was how I calculated 4 attacks/round. In order to get the +16 BAB, I needed 4 lvls of ranger and/or WM pre-epic. I couldn't become a WM until lvl 19 in this build so 2 lvls had to be Ranger.

He took weapon finesse as his 1st level feat, which he couldn't do if he started as a rogue.  That's a +5 to AB right there.  However, his penalty to each hand for dual wielding with this build won't be -2 as you appear to have it.  It will be -4.  Since it's a halfling, he would need to have a tiny weapon in his offhand to get the -2 penalty only.  A light weapon like the handaxe actually counts as a medium weapon in the hands of the small races (halfling and gnome).  So, as a 1st level ranger dual wielding hand axes he'll have two attacks (one for each hand) at an AB of 2, where as the first level rogue will have one attack with an AB of 0.<br><br>So it's a trade off really.  Taking your first level as ranger and getting weapon finesse means you'll have a decent AB from the start (6 with just one axe, 2 in each hand when dual wielding axes), but you'll have less skill points over all.  Taking rogue first means more skill points, but it also means you can't take weapon finesse until level 3, so you'll probably want to rely on a ranged weapon until then (and definitely don't want to dual wield until then either).  I'd personally still opt for the rogue first for the extra skill points, but you have to make your own decision about what's more important to you at the lower levels.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 03/27/05 10:14</span></i></p>

If hand axe is medium then its not finessable for a halfling, which means a big hit on AB for choosing hand axes.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

Uh oh. So that means he is not using his dex mod for fighting then...<br><br>I chose halfling for the favoured class rogue.

The descriptions in the manuals are quite different to how they are implemented in the game. For example a short sword or rapier is not finessable by halfings. The actual description should read - one size smaller than the wielder - So medium races can use small, small races can use tiny. Exception being medium races can use rapier as well.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

Handy info to know there.<br><br>Yes they are in fact finessable but from the point of view of using dual weapons they are -4/-4 and not -2/-2.

Oops, looks like I opened up a whole can of worms with my poor wording, lol.  When it said it was considered a medium weapon for halflings, I should have said that's only a problem with respect to dual wielding, not with finessing.  As long as the halfling can still use the weapon as a one-handed weapon, it can still be finessed.  The only finesseable weapon a halfling cannot finesse is the rapier, because that's a two hander for a creature that small.<br><br>Steve

Yeah, the rule would probably be better stated something like this:<br><br>For a medium creature, the penalty for wielding a medium weapon in their offhand is a -4 to attacked from both hands.  The penalty is reduced to -2 if the offhand weapon is <i>at most</i> light (i.e., it can be light or smaller, but the penalty doesn't get any less for weapons smaller than light).<br><br>Steve

Hmmm... except "light" is probably a relative term just as tiny/small/medium/large - what is light for a human might be heavy for a halfling.

I meant light in a technical sense, i.e. the weapons that the manual lists as "light".  Once you start getting into calling weapons heavy or light depending on the size of the creature wielding it...yeah, it all gets messy and confusing.<br><br>Steve
