If you use HIPS in combat (Disengage, HIPS, Attack), and your opponent beats your Hide/MS check with Spot/Listen, Are they still flatfooted, and must engage again? Or will they just keep attacking you as if you did not HIPS?<br><br>And also, what if your opponent has Unmodified True Seeing? Do they disengage and become flatfooted when you attack?

Well, I imagine both situations are the same. I'm usually too busy not dying in these situations to notice for sure, but I believe your chances of landing a sneak are not that good.

Activating HiPS during combat is supposed to reset your opponent's combat queu, so even if they have LoS and are locked on, they kind of have to start over again.  While it may not catch them flatfooted per se, there may be circumstances where it could leave them flatfooted, especially if they fail a Spot check or don't have TS, for they should drop out of combat at that point.  But it you HiPS, and they then engage with one of your summons, henchman or party member, then you get to land some sneaks that way, even though they may not be flatfooted.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

If you pass your spot check you see them and keep fighting them (no dropping out of combat hence no flatfootedness and what comes out of it), if you pass your listen check you still "see" them but you are dropped out of combat. Spot is what is needed vs HiPS, listen is "bugged".<br><br>True Seeing just makes HiPS useless. Nothing happens when stealth is activated vs a true seeing enemy (but the hipser becoming flatfooted).<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 11/01/08 17:47</span></i></p>
