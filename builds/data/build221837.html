This is a thought experiment that proves I'm crazy. It came about as combination of separate attempts to make a Spellsword that can be good in combat with a lot of WIZ levels and a melee mage. One thing led to another, and suddenly I found myself building with no warrior classes at all. It's probably one of the cheesier builds I've made (due to the level 40 skill dump and the recommended tactics of cheese spells), but it doesn't rely solely on the cheese factor.<br><br>Wizard 29/Cleric 10/Bard 1<br><br><b>Playable 1 to 40, PvM.</b><br><br>Low magic environment is probably ideal, but I think he could easily be played in a high magic environment as well.<br><br>Human, any non-Lawful alignment<br><br>STR 14 (22)<br>DEX 10<br>CON 14<br>INT 16 (20)<br>WIS 14 (15)<br>CHA 8<br><br>1 )WIZ1: Martial Weapons/ Toughness<br>2 )WIZ2<br>3 )WIZ3: Spell Penetration<br>4 )WIZ4: STR (15)<br>5 )CLC1<br>6 )CLC2: Still Spell<br>7 )CLC3<br>8 )CLC4: STR (16)<br>9 )CLC5: Extend Spell<br>10)CLC6<br>11)WIZ5: Combat Casting<br>12)WIZ6: Empower Spell/ INT (17)<br>13)WIZ7<br>14)WIZ8<br>15)CLC7: Weapon Focus<br>16)CLC8: WIS (15)<br>17)CLC9<br>18)CLC10: Improved Critical<br>19)WIZ9<br>20)WIZ10: Maximize Spell/ INT (18)<br><br>21)WIZ11: EWF<br>22)WIZ12<br>23)WIZ13<br>24)WIZ14: GRT STR I (17)/ STR (18)<br>25)WIZ15: GRT INT I (19)<br>26)WIZ16<br>27)WIZ17: Autostill I<br>28)WIZ18: STR (19)<br>29)WIZ19<br>30)WIZ20: Autostill II/ Autostill III<br>31)WIZ21<br>32)WIZ22: STR (20)<br>33)WIZ23: Epic Mage Armor/ Epic Warding<br>34)WIZ24<br>35)WIZ25<br>36)WIZ26: Epic Prowess/ Improved Combat Casting/ STR (21)<br>37)WIZ27<br>38)WIZ28<br>39)WIZ29: Armor Skin/ GRT INT II (20)<br>40)Bard1: STR (22)<br><br><b>Cleric Domains:</b> Strength and whatever else you like.

At the end, he was down to Badly Wounded. And, I never used the cheese spell tactics (Timestop, Bigby's, IGMS), except one ILMS to finish off the Rogue, and I activated Epic Warding part way through the battle with the Dracolich.

I've found characters like this to be surprisingly effective since I started playing with the sorcerer/cleric build I was inspired to create by a discussion on the general forums.  Combining an arcane caster with cleric gives you a lot of flexibility, sometimes in surprising ways.<br><br>The major drawback to meleeing with this sort of a build, I've found, is that your most important melee offense buff (divine power) is easily dispelled at any level.  <br><br>I'm not sure bard is a particularly better (or worse) choice than monk for your cheese skill dump level.  You can use divine and arcane scrolls and wands already because you're a wizard and a cleric both... that takes a lot of the empashsis off UMD in my opinion.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

True enough on the Monk, Xylo, but I hate Monks and refuse to use even a sngle level in any build. Also, 1 Bard gives you a Bard Song boost that will add a nice cheese-flavored +1 to AB and damage and is basically undispellable.<br><br>As to dipelling the DP buff, that's a very good point.

Hehe I thought since you were already going for broke on the cheeseness, you might consider the ultimate 1-level cheese.  I don't think bard's a bad choice either - in fact if monk didn't get you Evasion at level 1, there'd be no argument in favor of taking it in this build at all.<br><br>Put 43 of your leftover skillpoints towards Taunt, though, and I think bard wins out.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> <br><br>One thing I really like about how your build turned out is that you don't suffer from feat starvation.  The wizard's extra feats beat the sorcerer class with a stick for multi-classing like this: you don't really get much extra, but you do get everything you need.<br><br>Finally, weapon wasn't really discussed, but I'll put my vote in for using a scimitar.  Base damage dice are kind of irrelevant, but the scimitar can be keen edge'd and has good critical stats.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

The melee's simple: you buff yourself with long-term buffs immediately after resting (Bull's STR, Cat's Grace, Improved Invis, etc). When it comes time to get into it during melee, you just hit Divine Power (and any other short-term buffs you need) and suddenly you have the attack schedule and BAB of a FTR of the equivalent level. At character level 16 and beyond, this means an extra attack at full AB. (Actually, at levels 16 and 17, your BAB is only +10, so you actually end up with two extra attacks at full AB for those two levels frmo Divine Power)<br><br>You get Divine Power at character level 9 (CLC level 5), so from then on, you're basically a full-fledged FTR.<br><br>At low levels, I find a WIZ easy to level as a meleer. Level one and level 2 you'll rely on your familiar, but after that, you should be able to solo and survive just with your WIZ buffs.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...
