Tensing, my monk-multiclassed character in its black-hearted version, Tensing always makes 10 attacks per round if hasted, it is vital to use flurry of blows of course. It doesn't has very high saving throws, but deals great damage. The kama may seem weak at first, but a kama can deal up to 1d6 +10 +2d6 (acid/fire/cold/lightning) +strength modifier, in this case making 21 - 36 compared to the 10 - 40 an unarmed with monk bracers would make, but with 10 attacks instead of 8. In addition, critical hits work from rolls 17 - 20 with a threat of X3, plus overwhelming critical and devastating critical with a DC of 48, Improved Evasion, Sneak Attack, Improved Knockdown.<br><br>Playable levels 1-40<br>Excellent in PvM, untested in PvP<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Alignment: Lawful Evil (only)<br><br>Status starting - ending<br><br>STR 16 - 26<br>DEX 14 - 15<br>CON 14 - 14<br>WIS 10 - 10<br>INT 14 - 14<br>CHA 8 - 8<br><br>You might think it's crazy to have a low WIS with a Monk, but I need that STR (Devastating Critical), DEX (Ambidexterity) and INT (Expertise), and I wouldn't sacrifice my CON.

Hm, want me to butcher this? Just kidding, fun idea, but he has some problems. First, start with 8 wis and 15 DEX, no need for 10 wis. You are a STR based monk, who needs to stay in robes. Your AC doesn't seem to bad naked, but it truly will be a huge problem equipped, in truth it will probably be crap. 462 hp's is average, but low with your AC. Your number of attacks will deal damage quickly, but you will receive heavy puinshment along the way and will not last to long. Another thing, why Blackguard in this? No stealth skills, and no Knockdown, what is your sneak attacks for? Don't get me wrong, I like Blackguards very much.<br><br>At least try 11 monk for more even skilldumps, Blackguard13 and WM 16. You will lose an epic bonus feat though, but gain 2 AB. Even Monk11/BG22/WM7 is viable. More monk for even skilldumps but still lose only 4 hp's.

Skilldumps? what do you mean by that? I really don't get what you mean with that.<br><br>I've been thinking on its AC, should get around 60 or so, about its HP, if I get down my WIS, I would invest in CON, when I get my 25 STR for devastating critical it's enough base I think, at which point moving my WIS to CON and adding Con at level 40 would give me 40 more HP, plus maybe Toughness instead of Armor skin or blind-fight, for 80 more HP, but I think STR should stay there, AB gets to +53 with weapons, fair although not impressive, the damage is quite large.<br><br>I wanted Blackguard because I was tired of using Fighter (which might be better) when making Weapon Masters, the feats are troublesome, but I decided to give up a little AB from the Weapon Master for some Sneak attack on the Blackguard.<br><br>What do you mean by no Knockdown? Monk gains Improved Knockdown at level 8, and he's 9, so that's well covered.

Ok, the Devastating Critical DC was a complete error there......<br><br>Skills are mainly useless, I have so much skills because I need 13 INT for Expertise, but I don't want them, and I have no problem in leaving them to the end.<br><br>Thanks for the correction Kail, but you didn't said at least an "it's good", "I don't like it", "sounds fun", "crap", you know, some comments about the build.

Of course he has KDown. *sigh*<br><br>*bangs head to wall*<br><br>Think, Grim. Sorry about that. I still hold to my other points though.<br><br>I never said anything wrong about his damage dealing, or offense in general.<br>His defense is the problem. Where do you get AC from? No heavy armour, nor shield. No DEX or WIS. Of course you can use monk equipment and such, AC will still stay below average compared to others in the same environment.<br>Do not trade off Armor skin, you NEED all the AC you can possibly get.<br><br>Trading off 2 BG for 2 monk will also give you 1 better AC along with more skilldumps(and speed?).<br><br>I like the build, in truth I generally love BG's. You need some AC though. A usable Divine shield springs to mind. Would solve a few save issues to.<br><br> If you have to many skillpoints(I ALWAYS have to few), why don't you have any stealth skills?

Mostly I agree with Grim, your defenses are way low. IMO taking only 7 WM lvls with no FTR or CoT (for the bonus feats) it's not that good an idea, WM is such a feat sink if you look at it (I'm no big fan of WM 7 builds, I like builds with more WM lvls). In fact you end up using epic feat slots on preepic feats. I believe you'd be better off taking FTR or CoT instead, FTR would give you the possibiliy to take less monk lvls preepic and therefore to improve your AB (making up for WoC loss)plus access to WS/EWS and you could spread monk lvls around for tumble dumps (each 5 <b>base</b> ranks it's worth +1 AC). You could stop FTR at 6th lvl and get 1 more monk lvl for +1 AC. You could also lower your INT since skill points are not an issue to you and raise CHA, therefore improving your saves. BTW, spellcraft ranks would boost your saves, I'd consider taking 20 (modified) ranks in it for +4 ST vs spells.<br><br>Monk 10/FTR 8/BG 22 (Monk 4/FTR 4/BG 12 or Monk 4/FTR 6/ BG 10 preepic) is the way to go IMO. Or otherwise if you want to keep with your classes a minor tweak would be to go Monk 10/BG 22/WM 8 for +1 AC and +1 ki damage/day.<br><br>The concept is nice, I bet you'd be better off fighting in heavy armor, monk would still be useful for the many boni it gives. That at least would solve the AC issue, which is a BIG issue. I think you need to tweak the build a little to make it competitive.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

I don't quite understand the figures in your damage calculation. There's no sense in using magical equipment when posting a build, that makes it unavailable for comparison.

This is my first time posting a build, so I wouldn't know if talking about items was useful/useless.<br><br>The thing with the armor is that I can't use it, I mean, being Weapon Master and Blackguard I can equip all armor, sure, but any non-monk armor would make me lose 3 attacks per round, and that's the main quality....... I don't want to give that up, better to make a complete apart character.
