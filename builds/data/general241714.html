I am making a Paladin/CoT and I need a cool sounding name! I am just drawing a blank. It doesnt have to sound heroic or anything, I just cant stand that basic Generated Names.<br><br>Any ideas? Forgotten Realms setting if it makes a difference.

Male or female? What race? Do you care if it's a 'cliche' type name (such as Shieldbreaker, Hammerfist, Darkbane)?<br>_________________<br>Where I'm playing now: <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk.</a>

LOL, the DM might boot you just for that supid name...<br><br>Overall characteristics? you haven't posted the build yet, I recall you were making STR/CHA based, so some Divine Brawler, Slasher of Destiny, Your moma's... no, forget that one...<br><br>Name as descriptive or name alone or name + descriptive nickname?<br><br>Those before are only descriptive... you wouldn't name your son Divine Brawler, because.. it just sounds wrong.<br><br>For name alone I always steal something from another game, in example: Thaxll'ssyllia, I can't help you much more than that.<br><br>Name and descrption sounds cool IMO, "Saint Thomas", "Farah Goddes of the skies", "Grendel Paingiver", "Azurath the Called One"....<br><br>I admit I'm not good at making up names, but I make them up dammit.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 05/25/06 04:20</span></i></p>

I want a standard name that people can say, though nothing modern like "John Smith":roll:<br><br>Im terrible with this stuff.

You shouldn't make such a big deal about it, what could go wrong with a bad name? get laughs? I say that make people laugh is a good attribute, go with one randomly... and the worse that could happen is that nothing happens.
