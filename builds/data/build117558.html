Some people were asking what would be the most damage that somebody could do to a non-evil character. That's a fair question, so I thought I would do my first stab at it. I haven't thought much on this, but I will give you the starting, and ending stats and the feats. I didn't write the feats down at which level I took them, so you'll just have to figure it out.<br><br>My character is 5 weapon master/ 15 cleric/ 20 CoT. I'll give you what his damage would be if he rolls minimums for his scythe and minimum for darkfire.<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>Elf True Neutral Cleric with Strength and War Domains<br>Str 16<br>Dex 13<br>Con 6<br>Int 13<br>Wis 14<br>Cha 14<br><br>Ending Stats:<br>Str 30<br>Dex 13<br>Con 6<br>Int 13<br>Wis 17<br>Cha 17<br><br>Feats listed alphabetically. I used 3 CoT feats in epic levels to get greater wisdom. 4 epic feats for Great Strength 1-4 and 3 epic feats for great charisma 1-3.<br><br>Divine Might<br>Dodge<br>Expertise<br>Great Charisma 1,2,3<br>Great Strength 1,2,3,4<br>Great Wisdom 1,2,3<br>Improved Power Attack<br>Maximized Spell<br>Mobility<br>Power Attack<br>Spring Attack<br>Weapon Focus: Scythe<br>Weapon of Choice: Scythe<br>Weapon Proficiency exotic<br>Whirlwind Attack<br><br>You can raise strength to 42 with strength domain powers, maximized bull's strength, and Aura of Vitality. This will give you a +16 strength modifier. Using a 2 handed weapon will give you 1.5 * 16 = +24 Strength Modifier.<br><br>Maximize Eagle's Splendor so charisma ends at 22 or +6.<br><br>Minimum Damage Calculation to a neutral creature on a critical hit.<br>+2 (2d4 scythe)<br>+24 (strength modifier)<br>+10 (Improved Power Attack)<br>+5 (Greater Magic Weapon)<br>+6 (darkfire does 6-11 dmg.)<br>+1 (prayer)<br>+2 (battletide)<br>+5 (divine favor)<br>+4 (war domain powers)<br>+6 (divine might)<br>+7 (divine wrath is improved in epic CoT levels)<br>====<br>72 minimum damage each hit with scythe.<br><br>Critical hit would be: 72 * 5 = 360 damage to a neutral aligned person.<br><br>This build wasn't meant to be tough in PvP, nor was it meant to score critical hits all the time. In fact, I could switch the CoT levels for fighter levels and get epic weapon specialization, but that would lower my base damage by 1 point and wouldn't do as much damage. If I went fighter I could get improved critical: scythe and several other useful combat feats like knockdown, disarm, or called shot. However, by taking some of CoT levels in epic I was able to get great Wisdom 1,2,3 which the fighter couldn't get either. So going CoT does a little more damage.<br><br>cdaulepp<br><br>P.S. This was my first stab at this build. I am not sure if, when scoring a critical hit, sneak attacks get their damage multiplied by the critical hit multiplier or not. If sneak attacks do get their damage multiplied, then a 5 weapon master 35 rogue using a longbow would get x4 multiplier. This would do more damage to neutral people if the sneak damage is multiplied x4. If only the normal damage is multiplied x4 then my build will do more damage.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 02:47</span></i></p>
