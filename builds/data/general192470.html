1. Choose spell focus and greater spell focus in evocation or necromancy. Maybe you won't deal as much damage as mages, but that's better then nothing - and due to his wisdom-increasing buff, druid usually has better save DC for his spells then a mage.<br>2. Select bear or dire wolf as your animal companion. Buff him with everything you have. Many people make the mistake of underestimating the animal companion - don't be one of those losers.

I was thinking about a druid today.  If you look in the recent builds, you will see the Wise Elf Priest..  If you are gonna try a druid caster.. try dru30/cot10.  The key though, as in my build, is to take ALL cot lvs from 21 to 31.  You do this to take advantage of great wisdom feats, taking all 10 great wisdom.  Oh, and take zen archry!  Casters dont need melee (i dont consider clerics casters.. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  ) so it would be nice to do some damage when spells run out.  <br><br>If you take that advice, make an elf!  dru/cot will experience NO xp penalty, and it makes more sense, from a rp persepective, for an elf, non-fightr type to be using a bow.  just my 2 cents.<br><br>Peace

Use either human or dwarf. 16 Druid/4 CoT pre epic. 29 Druid/10 CoT/1 Monk by level 40. I know it's a caster druid but you should get Dragon shape anyway so you can fight when you run out of spells or when your spells don't work against your opponent.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Giantevilhead on 05/01/05 23:49</span></i></p>
