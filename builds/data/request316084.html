(40 HP there) further you discount a shifter build such as dwarven druid 5/shifter 10/DD 25. (60 base HP less than max).

Just pointing out that the "best" at these various things is most certainly not "uber."  <br><br>The strongest overall builds will depend heavily on environment.  I've got an idea of what I consider to be the strongest overall builds, but it's very heavily biased towards the environment in which I play.  Hence, it may be near useless for you.  I mean, bard25/fighter5/RDD10 is way up there on my list, but if you're given haste, and imp invis, and better than +5 keen weapons, and whatnot, then it's probably not so uber.  Just sayin', if you want something a little more useful than what build has the highest possible HP total, you're going to have to be far more specific.  Er... actually, you'll have to be far less specific.  Maybe we should just leave it at "what build has the highest AC" and such.  At least those questions are answerable.<br>_________________<br>Sorcerers and bards may also unlearn spells when gaining a level to get rid of a liked spell in favor of a worse one.

Funny.  I didnt want to get in on this cuz, well, max hp is so subjective!  LOL <br><br>take this build, done back before most of us even thought of nwn: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "118095", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>(Druid 14/CLC 4/CoT 22) by cdualepp</a><br><br>Now, YES it is illegal by 1.69 standards.  It is from 2004 and it was done by, arguably the most influential nwn builder in history ARGUABLY!  I say this cuz, by the time most of us were out of our building diapers, cd was retired having built legendary builds, some are still tops today.  <br><br>The interesting thing is, he doesnt use the same classes AND it has 8 con, to get a wimpy 1344 HP <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">   <br><br>Unfortunately, i dont see a way to make it legal, cept maybe 4 cleric for 1 ranger(epic toughness), but you come up 1 lvl short for dragon... by loosing cleric you loose 120 hp for 1224.  I dont have nwn set up, so i am totally going by my mind, but it could work.  <br><br>What's new is old again!  LOL<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 06/05/10 02:55</span></i></p>
