This first my first build I am ganna post on here so go easy on me =)<br><br> The Idea of this build was to create something that has very high ac and can do large amounts of Damage in the short term. The idea was given when I was on this server where there is 5 hellwurms to fight at once all with 3 heal each.<br><br>starting stats<br><br>14 str<br>17 dex<br>8  Con<br>14 intell<br>15 Wis<br>8  Chars<br><br>I leveled 15 Pally<br>           4 Monk<br>          19 weapon master<br>      then 2 monk<br> dunno if that is the max possible ab you get out of leveling like this but I can never be bothered to try and calculate stuff <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   <br><br>feats to be taken are normal feats for weapon master:<br>dodge <br>mobility<br>expertise<br>spring attack<br>weapon focus on (rapier)<br>whirlwind.<br><br>Other feats:<br>weapon fineese<br>improved crital<br>5 Greater dex<br><br>these feat I took using the extra feats provided by Wmp so i can use the normal feats for the 5 dex<br><br>Epic weapon focus<br>Epic powess<br>Epic weapon focus<br>Armour skin<br><br>and you get Improved knocked down for free for being 6 monk. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">   taken em down on dragons with heals and finish them <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>ending AC will be 34 naked <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br>ab will be 48/43/38/33 just holding a plan normal rapier with nothing on, i think thats pretty good since highest normal is 53. This is with out buffs*<br><br>with buffs from paladin ab becomes 58/53/48/43<br><br>on the server I go on max item is +5, with all the +5 items excluding a +5 rapier because I could only find +3 on the server &gt;&lt; but that didnt make difference since I had the magic weapon spell for +5 ab manage to be 64/53/48/43 and with the limited items I had increasing wisdom and dex which would add up to ac I got 67 ac<br><br>the damage on a crit is amazing compared to what I had orgnially in mind, don't expect much of the normal attack though, with the Pally buffs the buff damage  was (sonic, divine,physical, magic, 1/6 V evil) from magic weapon, deafing clang, divine favour and holy sword, I had a rapier of high road +3 which does extra 1d6 acid damage.<br><br>al togather I did damage from around 76-89 a crit with 50% chance crit haivng a keen rapier(damage varies alot), even thoug I had only 1 smite but it would give 123 damage <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   good finisher for thoughs nasty healing dragons <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>The pros of this build is high damage output in a short amount of time and big ac.<br>The down sides are its lack of HP which with out reroll mine came to be 370 ( i cannever be bothered to reroll <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   lol) and the fact once the buffs wear off damage decreases back to 60 a crit.<br><br>over all i think there are more pros then cons on this char, making it one of my favrites, hard to hit and can hit other people <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  .works wonderous on pvm if your a pvp player give this dex baby some +12 items could easlyly hve 107 ac and 72 ab making it good all round<br><br>hope you enjoy my build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">   and please do correct mistakes I have made <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   but I know build works cos actually made it !!<br><br><br>-------------<br>Proyo<br> you like pain !! you like pain? cccooolll<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 20:31</span></i></p>

A paladin with 8 charisma? That actually gives you a saving throw penalty! <br><br>I presume this is an elf build, but why did you start with 15 Wisdom? You're only going to need 14 to get full Paladin spells, so you could save points right there. Where did you out your ability points on levelling up, and what are the final stats for the build (ie. final unbuffed Str, Dex, Con etc.)??<br><br>It looks like a cool and interesting build, but I could use a little more information about it. A dex-based Paladin is always going to be hard to do, since Paladins need decent Cha, Wis, Con and Str - well, usually. Adding in WM levels is going to make it even harder, since the Paladin doesn't get any bonus feats, and it needs to take 6 feats to even qualify as a WM. You'll also need 13 Int at least, which most Paladins don't have the stat points for.

If I may ask why not go cleric? it would give you one less attack per round, but the cleric buffs would give vastly more ab and you would only need 8 strength because divine power boosts strength to 18<br><br>also if you go 9 monk you can get improved evasion - very nice for dexers<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By _Ferahgo_ on 11/14/04 02:19</span></i></p>

Yes it was an elf build.The reason why I had 5 wisdom was because I could use a +5 wisdom necklace on the server I go to which would give me extra ac (from monk) after all the +ac items maxed it to +12, making the widom higher would now stack on more ac as well as extra spell slot, and as for the the charisma giving lower saves. monk would have fixed the problem giving high reflex saves strangely enough My character actually has enough saves and never had a problem from any traps cause my reflex save is so high. I would take screen shots of him walking through all sorts of traps 10 times if you like and send them you if you give me your address, cause out of 10 probabaly one would hit. Was actually kinda surpised on some one talking about saves on this build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif"> , <br><br> could make a fighter bard rdd which would have higher ac and damage but the saves on that was so low every time these dragons breathed eletric dmg on me it took 1/5 of hp and 5 dragons doing that, i ll need a lot of heals. so i personnel consider this build one of my favs<br><br>Fort save 21<br>Reflex save 32   &lt;&lt;--this is most important for me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"> <br>Will save 15     &lt;&lt;--had helm to stop all mind effects<br>spell resistance 10 &lt;--had helm which has 32 spell           resistance so no need to increase this<br><br>As on the query of why didn't I think of a Cleric was because I needed to make a Paladin for an RP reason on the server I go to ( but Cleric would be a nice idea could try it out,a friend of mine has a built CLeirc wmp with warhammer does 200 a crit although I like paladin's spells more since it lasts longer and more sword buffs). Yes this build might not be as the best it can be but you have to understand the items on the server I had to make it from are very limited and i personnelly don't like the idea of 8 str since lots of things dispell.even though I had 14 str I had a few items to boost it to 22. <br><br>My final stats are <br><br>str 14<br>dex 32<br>con 8<br>intell 14<br>wisdom 15<br>chars   8<br><br>have fun and more suggestions please!! thx for the replies<br>---------------------<br>Proyo,  you like pain! you like pain? cccooolll

I think another idea for this build would be to go monk/COT/ Shadowdancer<br><br>Monk to level 8, COT to 8, SD to 4. Then after level 20 take SD to 5 and monk to 9 , with the rest on COT levels, maybe with a little sd or monk to max out the tumble skill.<br><br>this way you dont have to waste the feats getting weapon master. You should get +13 Saves from COT levels. As well as an additional 5 bonus feats. <br><br>You will qualify for epic dodge , and should you choose to some Self concealment (not enough to be worthwhile imo since you have empty body)<br><br>COT gets Great wis as a bonus feat on epic levels. Gives a similar theme of build but optimises the dex part of it. It is however a completely different build.<br><br>Syrath

cool what would the damage output be? and kinda trying to make a build that does over 70 damage whiles having 60 ac 400 hp and 60 ab with +5 gear, I can make builds that has 70 damage 74 ac 440 hp but ab is low only 54, need something that has 60 because people have up to 70 ac kinda of diffcult. Any ideas? the limited items on my server are are +5 sun soul boots +5 armour +5 dex bracer +4 weapons( most are only +1) +5 str belt haste ring, thats peob the best items in there, the rest are mostly junk.

Nope, you having same kind of problems on that server you go to?the one I go to have these diety people who has ridculous +8 gear compared to normal people which rarely max is +5, some are sad spend 20 hours a day at least to get a diety position and others get free gear for no reason as long as they kiss dm ***. stuipd people wiv +8 gear still have around same ablitities as my builds since they cant build jack and then keep kissing dm *** for relvls and relvls to try and make it better lol : / shame on them.<br>  I recently found the answer to my own orginal question on how to make a build that has at least 60 ac 60 ab whiles having about 400+ hp. The answer was staring me in the face, most people on fighter/wpm/rogue builds focus it all on str but i realized now a much better version of it can be made instead of pumping str up but yet keep around 100 dmg whiles having 400+ hp and 60 ab ac with +5 gear.<br><br> I will post this new build once I have made it as best as i possibly can <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  then I hope other people here ll come along and alter it to be even better <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

Just a comment on the 8 Cha : If the manual is to be believed, the Paladin adds his Cha modifier to saves only if it is +ve. I assume from this that if Cha -ve, it is ignored. Has anyone tried and tested this aspect?
