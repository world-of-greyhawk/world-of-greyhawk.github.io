Play on a server where arcane archer can only go 10 levels is it worth taking it or not. Or just stick to mage levels suppose. Guess question more so is is ten levels worth it ? or should be concerned with better dc values then instead. Will the bow really be handy sorta speak<br><br>Raven

AA has full AB progression and adds +1 to ranged (bow) AB and damage at AA level 1 and every 2nd level after that.<br><br>If your character primarily is a sorc/wizard, you can get + 9 to ranged AB if you take as many AA levels as you can (8) pre epic, and end up with 9 or 10 AA levels in the build. A wizard 30/ AA 10 built that way will have a ranged AB somewhere near 30/25/20 and damage 1d8 + 5 unbuffed, making him a mediocre mob killer at most.<br>If your character primarily is an archer, the extra AB and damage can come in handy.<br>AA can also be of some use to give strength (or charisma)based meleers a better ranged AB.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

The ONLY class worthy of your time is...   <br><br>Well, i dont even have to say it, do i?  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    <br><br>On a more serious note, what on earth do you want to play?  WHat build do you want to make?  This sort of question, while not AS offensive as "what is the uberist build", certainly ranks up there because it is subjective and IMPOSSIBLE for anyone other than you to give an intelligent answer.  <br><br>Another question, WHy do you want AA in the first place?  10 lvls IS very good IF you want to make an AA!  10 lvls is assinine IF you are making a pure caster.  AA gives NOTHING to the caster lv of a wiz/sorc, so why do it?<br><br>What i am trying to say is, you didnt give enough info about WHAT you are looking for, HOW you like to play, WHY you are lookin at AA in the first place, etc?
