Hello,<br><br>I've read thru about 125pages of these uber char builds yet can only recall a few Shifter builds. I would like to build an allround shifter that doesn't just concentrate on making an Uber dragon so here's a rough start. BTW this is PvM only.<br><br>I realise that there are some Shifter builds out there but I haven't seen any really detailed ones like the rest of the builds in this thread and am not sure about some details. Please provide some constructive criticism.<br><br>Human LN Druid 17/Shifter 17/Monk 6.<br><br>Stats: (Ending)<br>S 10<br>D 10<br>C 10<br>I 14<br>W 18 (28)<br>C 10<br><br>Rough Levelling guide:<br><br>01: Druid 1 -- --<br>02: Druid 1/Monk 1<br>03: Druid 2/Monk 1 --<br>04: Druid 3/Monk 1 +1 Wis<br>05: Druid 4/Monk 1<br>06: Druid 5/Monk 1 --<br>07: Druid 5/Monk 2<br>08: Druid 6/Monk 2 +1 Wis<br>09: Druid 7/Monk 2 Alertness<br>10: Druid 7/Shifter 1/Monk 2<br>11: Druid 7/Shifter 2/Monk 2<br>12: Druid 7/Shifter 2/Monk 3 +1 Wis --<br>13: Druid 7/Shifter 3/Monk 3<br>14: Druid 7/Shifter 4/Monk 3<br>15: Druid 7/Shifter 5/Monk 3 --<br>16: Druid 7/Shifter 6/Monk 3 +1 Wis<br>17: Druid 7/Shifter 6/Monk 4<br>18: Druid 7/Shifter 7/Monk 4 --<br>19: Druid 7/Shifter 8/Monk 4<br>20: Druid 8/Shifter 8/Monk 4 +1 Wis(23)<br>21: Druid 8/Shifter 9/Monk 4 Great Wisdom(24)<br>22: Druid 8/Shifter 10/Monk 4<br>22: Druid 8/Shifter 11/Monk 4<br>23: Druid 8/Shifter 12/Monk 4<br>24: Druid 8/Shifter 13/Monk 4 +1 Wis(25), Undead Shape<br>25: Druid 8/Shifter 14/Monk 4<br>26: Druid 9/Shifter 14/Monk 4<br>27: Druid 9/Shifter 15/Monk 4 Outsider Shape<br>28: Druid 9/Shifter 16/Monk 4 +1 Wis(26)<br>29: Druid 10/Shifter 16/Monk 4<br>30: Druid 11/Shifter 16/Monk 4 --<br>31: Druid 12/Shifter 16/Monk 4<br>32: Druid 12/Shifter 16/Monk 5 +1 Wis(27)<br>33: Druid 12/Shifter 17/Monk 5 Construct Shape<br>34: Druid 12/Shifter 17/Monk 5<br>35: Druid 13/Shifter 17/Monk 5<br>36: Druid 14/Shifter 17/Monk 5 +1 Wis(28) --<br>37: Druid 14/Shifter 17/Monk 6<br>38: Druid 15/Shifter 17/Monk 6<br>39: Druid 16/Shifter 17/Monk 6 Great Wisdom(29)<br>40: Druid 17/Shifter 17/Monk 6 +1 Wis(30), Dragon Shape<br><br>-- = Blank Feat<br><br>Rationale: Maximise BAB by Level 20, take Monk levels so as to get Tumble in lumps of 5 Ranks exactly. Get level 7 Druid asap for Stoneskin. After that, get Shifter levels as high as possible quickly and get all forms asap apart from Dragon which must be left til end for maximized powergaming . Take the final Monk Level at lvl 37 to get Tumble and Discipline to 40 each.<br><br>I don't have HotU yet so I'm not too sure about after Level 20, when the feats become available, etc. I think I only have 9 feats left to use? Does a Level 17 Shifter get any bonus feats?<br><br>Can I take the feats as I've suggested here? I'm not too sure about the Undead and Dragon ones if I have them right. The rest of my feats I'm not sure of:<br><br>Luck of Heroes<br>Heavy Armour (is this necessary?)<br>Zen Archery (backup ranged attacker?)<br>Weapon Focus (Unarmed)<br>Imp Critical (Unarmed)<br>Expertise<br>Imp Expertise<br>Extend Spell<br>Empower Spell<br>Maximize Spell<br>Toughness<br>Lightning Reflexes<br>Blind Fighting<br><br>Thats actually 13, which one(s) could I leave out and are there others (epic) that might be better?<br><br>Skills:<br><br>I reckon this char would end up with 301 skill points.<br>Monk Levels:<br>Tumble 40<br>Discipline 40<br>Hide 40<br>Move Silently 40<br><br>Druid/Shifter Levels:<br>Spellcraft 40<br>Concentration 43<br>Animal Empathy 43<br>Persuade 11<br>Open Locks 1(2)<br>Disable Trap 1(2)<br><br>Thanks.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 10/12/07 19:57</span></i></p>
