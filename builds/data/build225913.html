I’ve been playing a build which was created by our lovely grizzled_dwarflord and I was very successful playing and killing people with it. I mean who expects a heavy armor guy sneaking and kickin’ the cr*p out of you.

Ahh, homage to His Infernal Concubine.  Thank you.  My one suggestion, and it's but a minor one, is to drop Luck of Heroes, accelerate your other feats, and take Extra Smiting some where between 12-18th lvl.  With 22 CoT levels, the LoH is probably superfluous.  While Extra Smiting will give you some nice solid Divine Damage against bosses whenever you need that extra push.<br><br>You could even drop 2 CoT levels in Epic for two more Rogue, acquire another Rogue bonus feat, 1d6sneak and 12 more skill points, and only lose one CoT bonus feat.  Your Divine Wrath will remain intact since 20CoT will still give you +9AB/+9Damage.  Another nice added "push", particularly with a few Charisma enhancing items.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

does smiting really make a difference?<br><br>I thought it only helps (really helps) if you have a charisma based build...<br><br>Taking 2 extra rogue instead of CoT yeah thats a good idea, makes it easier to get improved evasion aswell <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>where would you suggest it be best to drop those 2 CoT levels?

I'm playing your Knight of the Quest there and every smite I do, even when the damage goes well over 150, is physical and not divine. Only the extra damage coming from Divine Might is... but I still think that Extra Smiting is worth taking in a pally or CoT heavy build. That extra damage can always come in handy in dire situations and will often help change the tide of battle.
