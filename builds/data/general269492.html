As Finn said, two handed or shield are most common, normally a better choice, besides ITWF it's a 3 feats investment that requires Ambidexterity, which <b>requires 15 DEX</b>, and that's a waste of DEX for such builds that wear heavy armor and when you're already one step into DEX based.<br><br>I made a dual wielding Fighter 8 / Champion of Torm 4 / Dwarven Defender 28 some time ago (DWD needs 13 DEX anyway, so that's why it's so close), the added damage was worth it more than a two handed weapon since STR was not really too high to be able to get EDR, though I never posted that one as a level 40 build... using that much Fighter and CoT makes a build have too much feats, where dual wielding is a fair feat investment, on that base you can easily make dual wielding STR based builds if you have free feats, if not, it's probably just not worth it.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/27/07 21:02</span></i></p>

My Natures executioner is a dual-wielding STR build. The more damage you get from other sources than strength, the more viable dual-wielding becomes over 2handers. But even in non-rangers, a strength based dual-wielder does more damage than a 2hand wielder. The example with DwD can easily dual-wield over since you already invest in 13 dex. The same goes for WMs. I played a few, and the massive damage you dish out makes it really fun to play it.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Most dual wield builds are DEX based (since it requires 15 DEX, unless built with Ranger) and a lot use Sneak Attack to create lots of damage. Thats fine and all, but when you run into foes who are immune to sneak attack, it can be a real pain in the ***. I like the option to not always have to sneak to do damage and be able to stand toe to toe with an enemy when need be. My lastest build, "Relentless Assault", is built this way.

A STR based RDD deals more with a two handed weapon in most cases, because two handed weapon gets a damage modifier of 1.5 your STR score while the dual-wielding offhand gets it penalized to 0.5. Such a build would only deal better damage dual-wielding if weapons have a lot of enhancement and magical damage that can overrun the STR score boost, at which point going STR based can end useless as well.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/29/07 21:23</span></i></p>

That might be true against foes with some DR or against a set AC, but most of the time dual-wielding outperforms 2hander in terms of total damage. Concealment, ED etc increases the dual advantage.<br><br>F.ex. think of your AB Hasted, highest-lowest:<br>45/45/40/35/30 with 2hander<br>45/43/43/38/38/33/28<br>Although each attack does less damage from Strength, just do the maths. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Yeah well, it's complicated... against such things like Epic Dodge the more APR the better, I can't argue against that.<br><br>Your dual-wielding AB progression needs a -2/-2 Grim <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   though I'd say -3/-3 is more fair due to the fact that you'll need 15 DEX for starters, which will make you lower initial stats compared to a STR based 8 DEX build. I find it to be a matter of real STR scores, nasty RDDs can get base STR scores in the 40s, which adds bonus of about +8 damage or more if buffed, also the fact that the two handed weapon gets a higher dice in regular hits, in such cases I'll always pick a Greatsword over two kurkis, two handed weapon bonus STR loses a lot of real efficiency if your base STR score is below 30.<br><br>I'll agree with you most of the times dual-wielding will outperform the two hander, but it doesn't applies in the same way in the case of RDDs.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/30/07 21:48</span></i></p>

Actually, the kukri example brings up another point - crits. The only way to get an extended rit range with a 2-hander is to use a halfling or gnome and wield a scim or rapier. But you can dual-wield kukris to get the higher crit range, and score more critical hits. That may bump a dual-wielding build up yet a bit more against crit-susceptible enemies. Of course, it bumps the two-handed weapon up a bit more against crit-immunes....<br><br>TM

I think DR is the only situation that favors 2hander over dual-wielding because of the number of attacks the better AB. More damage in total. Even i high STR builds, since very rarely do all your damage come from STR, and the total damage bonus for your best attacks ends up the same anyway. Ask Kail, I think he has done extensive studies, ;p .<br><br> In a feat-starved build you're often better off going with the 2hander, all depending.<br><br>I'd also like to add a note that my view might be coloured since I usually play Rangers and the FE and BoE bonus clearly favors dual-wielding, even if it costs a few AC points.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

One other comment - in environments where you have access to a smith, or where items can have multiple useful properties (haste, true sight, regeneration, ability buffs, etc.), dual-wielding gives you 2 slots to put bonuses on. <br><br>TM

That's a nice build, but why do you say we got it all wrong? for starters, just changing the weapon katana to kama will increase its dual-wield AB, being a STR based you shouldn't need a katana, kama will even be better in the end anyway, since being a monk you don't need to take Exotic Weapon and you would end with 9 APR with Flurry, so I would change that about the build there, besides, there isn't anything very special about it, you can get better stats out of a Fighter / Cleric / Weapon Master easily, so don't overglorify that build there.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 06/06/07 15:14</span></i></p>
