Just as the subject says, what would you think of a Wizard/Sorcerer build? like a pre-critic, before I go on making a build which might get marked as crap. I somehow got to think about it, and I'd like some critics about it, it sounds like DCs will be crap, spell damage will be low or something like it, but I imagined the great amount of spell slots could get a practical resistance quality, especially for PvM (oddly, it would be a high level build). Sorcerer 21 / Paladin 1 / Wizard 18 doesn't sounds that bad, it could get Epic Warding and a handy amount of IGMS to spam.<br><br>And come to think about it, this build could make the meanest bully in history of NWN, I can't imagine any server where this guy would not get banned for spamming Time Stop, he should have more level 9 arcane slots than any other build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">

You would get 2 full compliments of arcane spells. Ending CHA on 20 levelling early as a sorcerer, then getting your INT as high as possible would make it nasty enough with no-savers and you'd have a healthy range of defensive spells too. Penetration is crap though. You'd probably end up the king of IGMS and Icestorms with such a build, with enough mantles etc to boot. Only thing I would say is, good luck sorting your quickslots. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

A build like this has a few problems...<br><br>First of all, stats. You'll want both your INT and CHA as high as possible, leaving little room for other stats like DEX or CON.<br><br>Second, as mentioned before your caster levels will be low for a lvl40 build, resulting in lower damage, DC, and penetration.<br><br><br>I really think a simple Sorc or Wiz will be a lot better than this build, especially if the module you play has no big rest restriction or anything, but if you really want to do this I guess your best bet is to start as either a pure Sorc or a pure Wiz. This would make the build a lot more playable early on, when you probably want to get access to good spells more than you want a lot of the same spells. Then in Epic start levels for the other class to get those extra spell slots.

LOL, but it's not that hard, the num pad is easy to handle with a mage, you only get to cast 2 spells per round anyway, I haven't sorted out the lack of quickbar space... with Extended and Empowered stuff of both classes' spells it's going to be impossible to cast everything.<br><br>I thought for a second the amount of spell slots will make him a very reliable PvM caster, but come to think of it, the slots will only come to notice over level 30-35, so, who knows, might not be too practical, but it should be fun.<br><br>My initial idea was to increase INT to 19 and go all CHA, you just can't get both INT and CHA to 28 for extra level 9 slots, and CHA will net saving throws with a single Paladin level, Wiz slots will take all the buffs and the non-save spells, the rest on Sorc, 21 Sorc for Epic Warding, so I end 2 Wiz levels of max slots, but I think Epic Warding and that much saves is worth it. CON should be regular, I won't give it less than 14, of course HP can't get high so it's important to resist a single hit, DEX will get low though, and AC won't be that good.<br><br>The real stat problem is that skills aren't reciprocal, it's best for skills to start with INT, but Sorcerer before is more playable as it will get Epic Warding at a playable level.<br><br>Good thing, I read Sorcerer and Wizard levels stack for the Familiar.<br><br>Thanks.

I played around with the idea a bit, but there's not too much you can do with the level order... I don't play pure caster character very often and this isn't tested ingame, so I'm not saying this is the best build... but how about this:<br><br>Human<br>STR: 8<br>DEX: 12<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 16 (20)<br>CHA: 16 (22)<br><br>01: Sorcerer(1): Toughness, Combat Casting<br>02: Sorcerer(2)<br>03: Sorcerer(3): Spell Focus: Necromancy<br>04: Sorcerer(4): CHA+1<br>05: Sorcerer(5)<br>06: Sorcerer(6): Spell Penetration<br>07: Sorcerer(7)<br>08: Sorcerer(8): CHA+1<br>09: Sorcerer(9): Greater Spell Focus: Necromancy<br>10: Sorcerer(10)<br>11: Sorcerer(11)<br>12: Sorcerer(12): CHA+1, Greater Spell Penetration<br>13: Sorcerer(13)<br>14: Sorcerer(14)<br>15: Sorcerer(15): Maximize Spell<br>16: Sorcerer(16): CHA+1<br>17: Sorcerer(17)<br>18: Sorcerer(18): Empower Spell<br>19: Sorcerer(19)<br>20: Sorcerer(20): CHA+1<br>21: Wizard(1): Armor Skin<br>22: Wizard(2)<br>23: Wizard(3)<br>24: Wizard(4): CHA+1, Epic Spell Penetration<br>25: Wizard(5): Still Spell<br>26: Wizard(6)<br>27: Wizard(7): Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy<br>28: Wizard(8): INT+1<br>29: Wizard(9)<br>30: Wizard(10): Expertise, Automatic Still Spell I<br>31: Wizard(11)<br>32: Wizard(12): INT+1<br>33: Sorcerer(21): Epic Spell: Epic Warding<br>34: Wizard(13)<br>35: Wizard(14)<br>36: Wizard(15): INT+1, Improved Expertise, Automatic Still Spell II<br>37: Wizard(16)<br>38: Wizard(17)<br>39: Wizard(18): Automatic Still Spell III<br>40: Paladin(1): INT+1<br><br>Max HP: 286<br>Fort: 24 +9 vs spells<br>Ref: 23 +9 vs spells<br>Will: 27 +9 vs spells<br>AC (mundane armor/shield): 28<br><br>Concentration 43(45)<br>Discipline 43(42)<br>Spellcraft 40(45)<br>Tumble 20(21)<br><br>Hitpoints are a bit low, but saves are great and AC is decent in Plate&amp;Shield. And of course you've got Epic Warding to keep you safe. Focus in Necromancy gives you a bit better chance at landing those death spells, and Penetration makes it a bit easier to hit those with SR.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By LuckyNephilim on 12/20/06 13:54</span></i></p>

Hmm, I've been toying with the spread too, and I got to think I'll simply take the idea of max possible arcane spell slots to avoid thinking it looks like crap XD.
