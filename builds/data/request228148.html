I'm playing on a PW which has some rather strict multiclassing rules.  For this particular PW, it's a good thing.<br>I'd like to play a Pale Master there, but I have some things that need to be considered.<br><br>Cap is at 20th (for now)<br>All Classes must have a minimum of 5 levels (so no 3 level wizard dips)<br><br>My original version of this character on another PW was much like the <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_undeadlord.html" target="_blank"> Undead Lord </a><br>This obviously wouldn't work out quite right with only 20 levels to work with.<br><br>I'd like to end up with a fella who can cast, at least a little, in full plate and shield, and have the full 10 levels of PM by 20th, while keeping the 5 level rule stated above.<br>And no Bard <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   Just doesn't fit the character.<br><br>Is it possible to make such a character without them being a total waste of time, stat-wise?<br><br>What sort of build/feats/progression could you recommend?<br><br>I know this won't be an amazing build...that's not what I need.  He's all about the RP.  I just need him to be able to survive long enough to RP <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  <br><br>Thanks so much<br><br>Draco<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By IMDrgnfly on 01/24/06 17:45</span></i></p>

Here's the thing:  lv 20 cappd builds are fun, but YOU have to really decide what you want.  To be able to cast out of full plate/shield with 10 pm lvls.. think about it!  The BEST you could do is wiz5/ftr5/pm10.   This doesnt really give you alot of casting, but if you increase intelligence, you could get a few.   What terribly hurts your idea is the min 5 rule.  DO you have to take 5 of one before you can take another?  THis would mean your progression would be ftr5/wiz5/pm10 (at least for rp reasons).  You dont really have much of an alternative on this pw.<br><br>Hope that helps.   Peace

Maybe you should take wiz 10/pm 10. Forget about the full plate and use damage reduction buffs instead along with the the defensive spells giving damage to the attackers. The AB won't be very good, but it will only be +2 better with a fighter 5/wizard 5 build.Your caster lvl will be 10 and you should be able to learn lvl 8 spells. Your buffs will last longer and you can afford to extend them. GMW will give you a +3 enchantment instead of +1 with 5 wizard levels. You won't get WP martial and the 3 bonus fighter feet. But you'll get one more metamagic. You should be able to afford to take the WP martial or exotic to be able to use a greatsword or scythe.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

possibly drop fighter for CoT at later levels  - ie W5, PM 5, CoT 5 - improves your saves by 2 points and Divine Wrath becomes available - provided you have a positive modifier to your CHA.<br><br>best you can manage with that split is 3 attacks per round mind you.<br><br>has potential though I think.

Good point!  It would be tempting to do a sorc5/cot5/pm10 type thing!  Too bad for the lv 20 lvl limit.  Sorc5 is pretty close to useless!  You get, what lv 2 spells?  WOOPIEEE!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>peace<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 01/26/06 02:32</span></i></p>
