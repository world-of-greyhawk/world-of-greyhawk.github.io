Oh, it can be done because I just did it.  You might be able to take Terrifying Rage at 21st, though I don't know how strict it'll be in allowing for your Intimidate score, which would only be 24.  I know you can reach it at Lvl 24 provided you have 15 levels of Barbarian (that is the key). I'm interested in seeing the Revised version.<br>_________________<br>Homer: Lisa, would you like a donut? <br>Lisa: No thanks. Do you have any fruit? <br>Homer: This has purple in it.

Slightly revised version - actually build from scratch and tested (the other version was as well though).<br><br>Changes:<br><br>1) did as grizzled_dwarflord suggested and took a COT and Fighter level pre-epic to get  the bonus feats earlier - HOWEVER even though I took fighter at level 30 and took the Great STR IV feat to get my STR to 23 "Overwhelming Critical" wasn't available!!! so I had to wait to level 31 - why it doesn't work beats me. <br><br>2) I made a mistake in the first build and put Thundering Rage at 39, it was supposed to be at 40.<br><br>3) end stat changes - concentration skill dropped by one since I took the fighter level earlier, upped heal by one.<br>Saves all changes: Fort/Reflex got one higher, will dropped by one - I have no clue why, my own calculations makes me think they should have been 36/24/17 - maybe someone clever can tell me why they end up as they do.<br><br>NOTE: It seems that the description for Terrifying rage says Epic Barbarian (also in game) you can actually take even though your Babarian levels are not epic.<br><br>Here's the new version:<br><br>Start Stats:<br><br>Dwarf<br>Alignment: chaotic good, neutral good, true neutral, chaotic neutral<br><br>STR 15<br>DEX 14<br>CON 18<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 6<br><br>Equipment: Full Plate/Tower Shield/Battleaxe<br><br>Barbarian 24/Fighter 6/Champion of Torm 10<br><br>01 Barbarian - Dodge<br>02 Fighter - Mobility<br>03 Fighter - Power Attack/Weapon Focus: Battleaxe<br>04 Fighter [CON]<br>05 Fighter - WP Specialization: Battleaxe<br>06 Barbarian - Cleave<br>07 Barbarian<br>08 Barbarian [CON]<br>09 Barbarian - Imp Critial: Battleaxe<br>10 Barbarian<br>11 Barbarian<br>12 Barbarian - Knockdown [CON]<br>13 Barbarian<br>14 Barbarian<br>15 Barbarian - Great Cleave<br>16 Barbarian [STR]<br>17 Barbarian<br>18 Barbarian - Blind Fight<br>19 Fighter<br>20 COT [STR]<br>21 COT - Great STR I/Epic Weapon Focus: Battleaxe<br>22 COT <br>23 COT - Epic Prowness <br>24 COT - Great STR II[STR]<br>25 COT - Epic DR I<br>26 COT <br>27 COT - Great STR III/Epic DR II <br>28 COT [STR]<br>29 COT - Armor Skin<br>30 Barbarian - Great STR IV<br>31 Fighter - Overwhelming Critical: Battleaxe <br>32 Barbarian [STR]<br>33 Barbarian - Terrifying Rage<br>34 Barbarian<br>35 Barbarian<br>36 Barbarian - Devastating Critical: Battleaxe [STR]<br>37 Barbarian<br>38 Barbarian<br>39 Barbarian - Mighty Rage<br>40 Barbarian - Thundering Rage [STR]<br><br>End stats<br><br>STR 26<br>DEX 14<br>CON 21<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 6<br><br>Skills used:<br><br>Discipline 43<br>Intimidate 43<br>Taunt 43<br>Concentration 34<br>Heal 23<br>Tumble 20<br><br>Hitpoints: 648<br><br>Saves:<br>Fortitude 35<br>Reflex 24<br>Will 19<br>(+2 vs. spells because he's a dwarf).<br><br>DR 11/- <br><br>Naked stats<br>AC: 18<br>AB: 39/34/29/24<br><br>With Full Plate/Tower Shield/Battleaxe<br>AC: 28<br>AB: 42/37/32/27<br>Damage: 1-8 + 10 (19-20/x3)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By MartinJHolm on 05/08/05 14:05</span></i></p>

Thanks for the input, I think this is the final build - I optimized it to be as playable as possible, meaning he will be alternating between the 'upgrades' as much as possible in Epic Levels.<br><br>1. Chance to hit: Epic WP Focus, Epic Prowness, Mighty Rage<br>2. AC/DR: Armor Skin, Epic DR<br>3. Damage: Overwh./Dev.

Nice buid, my version is called "thre true barbarian", it's in the list! I took 8 DX and started with 17 STR, but at the end the two builds have the same feats. =8)

I agree they are similar in many ways (the level distribution is identical) - but I'd still have to say mine is overall better <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"> <br><br>Hehe, I'm not trying to be an smartass here but I already see the major weakness in my build as the AC and your build has an even worse AC, I mean: no dodge, no Armor Skin, negative dex modifier, not using a shield .. basically your AC sucks, if you were up agains something like a dragon you would be in big trouble unless of course you dev. critted it quick - in PvP your build wouldn't last many seconds before you were the one critted though.<br><br>But granted your build does a lot more damage and you do have Imp. Power Attack (which my build really could use) and "base" you have 80 hp more than mine. You maximized intimidate, but in my opinion that isn't worth it - if I was to maximize intimidate I would go with some kind of Barbarian/Bard build (actually I'm going to do that - next project).<br><br>One thing that I realize from looking at your build is that I probably should invest in a weapon with a higher crit range, maybe a scimitar - somehow an axe is just what I figure a dwarf would wield.

I have to agree about the AC... but hey, that's what items are for... obtaining 4 dex it's not difficult, and 12 Dex it's the maximum you need due to the armor restriction. For the rest I really don't see why your build can be definied "overall better", since enemy's damage reduction can be a serious problem for your build, mine instead does a lot of damage even with the mundane weapon... it's a matter of points of view...

I don't disagree on the damage, my build does have a hard time doing damage to cretures with 30/- DR but on the other hand it wont get hit as much as your build would.<br><br>Aside from me suggesting a one had weapon and a shield and you go for a two handed weapon (we could both change that without altering the builds) it boils down to:<br><br>You pick Imp. Powerattack, I pick Knockdown<br><br>I get +3 AC (Dodge, Armor Skin) and you chose to enhance your "Rage Aura".<br><br>So the difference isn't really huge but in my experience the enhanced maneuverability my build has (dodge/mobility) would give it the edge.

Honestly, I think mobility is a bit of a waste.  With your ranks in Tumble you're going to avoid all Attacks of Opportunity from moving in battle without fail, and Uncanny Dodge means you're never going to be flatfooted.  The only way this character would really get AoOs would be from drinking potions in combat, but with your high HP, you shouldn't need to do that.  And you could always run back a bit out of combat, since you'll automatically avoid all AoOs from movement and will have a slight speed boost anyway, and drink there.  Basically, Mobility is giving you +4AC in a situation that will pretty much never occur.<br><br>Steve

I guess you're right about that.<br><br>I think I might have made too many shadowdancer builds and somehow now always need to fit mobility in any build I make, LOL.

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  , I can definitely understand that.  If you drop Mobility, then you could squeeze in something like Improved Power Attack to eke out some extra damage, or perhaps Improved Knockdown.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 05/09/05 18:33</span></i></p>

It's ok... but i think you're right about the focused ability, I think I can drop the lesser one for armor skin, in order to gain 2 AC for a not-so useful ability.. anyway, I love to see a raging dwarf... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_mad.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_mad.gif">

Anyone who discounts the effectiveness of a high intimidate coupled with terrifying rage is a bit behind the power curve.  Terrifying rage is perhaps the most useful of all barbarian specific feats on almost all servers be them PvM or PvP, and on high magic it easily trumps all other barb abilities.  I really encourage you to look into it before making pretty humorous statements regarding +2 AC when TR is going to almost without fail force -2 AB on the attacker... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>Now add in possible fear + coup de grace and -2 to saving throws.  It's pretty straight forward.  An intimidate of only 40 will achieve a fair amount.

Thanks Strvinsky00, that’s what I meant. Hadrian Quinn, my build does use the “Aura” and has a check of 55. I was thinking that even without “focused ability: intimidate” he has a check of 51, which seems already good to me, and I can take “armor skin” instead of it. See? I was not discounting intimidate or making humorous statement… maybe because the whole build is based on  it… try to find my build and you’ll see it… <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">
