<b> You can sneak and sing, even slash when you must, your road to 40th street is smooth enough PvM</b><br><br>The Bloodaxe brothers had both gained quite the reputation. Both for their way with women and the world in general, but also for the combat prowess both showed. Both brothers had a knack for the arcane and was known to enhance their already impressive prowess with arcane magicks. They were both handsome by the standards of their people and well-spoken. They both sung on the battlefield and when danger ensued.<br><br>They were alike. They were oh so different. The youngest brother was tall and strong and wielded the battleaxe to combat. His training and knowledge of the arcane enabled him to cast his magicks even in full steel armour. His song was deep and powerful, a light-tower for his allies and a point of intimidation and powerlessness for his enemies. Rumours said they could feel the power of his song in their bones even after battle had stilled. Many was the skulls he had cleaved. And when given the chance he sure could hit behind the defenses of his unaware adversaries.<br><br>The oldest brother however was small and nimble. What he lacked in muscle he made up for in cunning and speed. He wore no armour and wielded a handaxe to make use of his grace, and his shield was smaller and lighter. He was able to evade oncoming attacks and usually attacked from hiding or by surprise instead of head on confontation. He used his arcane powers to increase his chances of going unnoticed. His song when in battle was almost a whisper, though it still carried long. His allies would hear a faint voice of encouragement and feel confident without really knowing why. His enemies heard a ghostlike whisper that nagged at their inner fears, making them unfocused and frightened. Sometimes when he hunted whatever adversary he was known to have already trppaed his adversary in, and was just watching while his spikes and acid did their job.<br><br>This was the rumours and legend, now see for yourself what the oldest brother Bloodaxe is like.<br>--------<br>For the STR build, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "246872", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Rogue(18), Fighter(6), Bard(16), Dwarf<br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 16 (26)<br>CON: 16<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 12<br>CHA: 13 (16)<br><br>01: Rogue1: Kdown<br>02: Fighter1: Weapon Finesse<br>03: Rogue2: Toughness<br>04: Fighter2: DEX+1, Blind Fight, (DEX=17)<br>05: Fighter3<br>06: Fighter4: WF: Handaxe, Wep Spec: Handaxe<br>07: Bard1<br>08: Bard2: DEX+1 (18)<br>09: Bard3: Lingering Song<br>10: Rogue3:<br>11: Bard4<br>12: Rogue4: DEX+1, Extend Spell, (DEX=19)<br>13: Rogue5<br>14: Bard5<br>15: Bard6: Curse Song<br>16: Rogue6: DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>17: Rogue7<br>18: Bard7: Improved Critical: Handaxe<br>19: Bard8<br>20: Rogue8: DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br>21: Rogue9: Epic WF: Handaxe<br>22: Fighter5<br>23: Fighter6: Epic Wep Spec: Handaxe<br>24: Bard9: DEX+1, GrDex I, (DEX=23)<br>25: Bard10<br>26: Rogue10: Improved Evasion<br>27: Rogue11: Great Dexterity II, (DEX=24)<br>28: Bard11: DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br>29: Rogue12<br>30: Rogue13: Epic Dodge, Defensive Roll<br>31: Bard12<br>32: Bard13: CHA+1, (14)<br>33: Bard14: GrCha I, (15)<br>34: Rogue14<br>35: Rogue15<br>36: Bard15: CHA+1, Epic Prowess, (CHA=16)<br>37: Bard16<br>38: Rogue16: Crippling Strike<br>39: Rogue17: Armor Skin<br>40: Rogue18: DEX+1, (DEX=26)<br><br>Hitpoints: 424 (very good in a D6 heavy build) + endurance<br><br>Saving Throws<br>Fortitude 21<br>Will 18<br>Reflex 31<br><br>BAB: 26<br>AB (mundane handaxe): 38/33/28/23, 35 (ranged), plus the bard spells we all know and love, Cats, GMW, Warcry and doublesong.<br><br>AC (naked/mundane large-shield): 28/30 + Cats, II and song.<br><br>dmg: 1d6 (19-20/x3), +9d6 sneak attack. +Song, GMW, warcry<br><br>Skillpoints: 287<br>Concentration 40(43)<br>Disable Trap 35(38)<br>Hide 43(51)<br>Move Silently 43(51)<br>Perform 27(30)<br>Search 12(13)<br>Set Trap 20(30)<br>Tumble 40(48)<br>UMD 27(30)<br><br>Spells known: 0-6<br>5-5-4-4-4-4-2<br><br>Spells/day: 0-6<br>4-5-5-4-3-2-0<br>*Note, you need +6 to CHA from items to get any lvl 6 castings.

Rogue 18...seems a trifle inelegant to me.  Why not drop Fighter to 5 (still get EWS, but as a general feat) and increase Rogue to 19, using the bonus feat for Epic Dodge to make up for the general feat you're now spending on EWS?  You lose 4 HP, but gain 6 skill points (which I notice are a bit low...no spellcraft?) and 1d6 sneak damage.  And you don't have that ugly wasted level <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  .

So the tradeoff for that extra skillpoints is 4 hp's and either xp-penalty a few levels extra or later ED. You can take 2 fighter levels though for 1 feat and 8 hp's, the cost would be skillpoints and as you noted, you are about 120 short already. You might perhaps go Bard 17/Rogue 17 for an extra lvl 3, 5 and 6 spell and actually get that casting of a level 6 spell <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   . You would also learn an extra lvl 2 and 6 spell. Not sure why I didn't do that, because it sure as h**l was better.

Wierd family tree, one brother is human the other is dwarven.  The rogue 18 does look a little odd.  You might also consider going rogue 16/fighter 8/bard 16.  You lose 1D6 sneak attack but pick up an extra feat (epic prowess), which would free up a regular epic feat.  Just some food for thought.<br><br>Well crafted btw.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

It's not a Dwarf, it's a short human. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  Dwarf was the only one who could avoid xp-penalty. <br><br>Yeah, I rant about going for 8 fighter in my last post, but finally concludes my discussion that Rogue17/Bard17 would be the way to go.

Nice, Grim. That level split sounds good. And as to the short human/brothers concept . . . well, there's you have it folks: as the diamond industry (and Marilyn Monroe) seem to insist, would seem that diamonds were the brothers' mother's best friend (and def. goes to great lengths to explain er Hollywood <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  ) Actually though, get some nice race bonuses from dwarves, including hardiness vs. spells and all that good stuff, which makes up somewhat for the skills. Not to mention of course their legendary knowledge of stone cutting - CUTE (and cool builds <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
