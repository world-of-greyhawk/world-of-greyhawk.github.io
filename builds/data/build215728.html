The epitome of lameness in all of NWN- the Monk/AA. Runs so fast melee can't catch it, runs so fast mages can't click it. Align restricts, I know, but if u are playing under them you can sub bard for wiz or sorc. Just means you get less ab (unless you use true strike and then called shot would work a lot better).<br><br>Here it is in all it's lame glory.<br><br><b>playable 1 - 40 PvM or PvP</b><br><br>01: Bard(1): Point Blank Shot<br>02: Bard(2)<br>03: Bard(3): Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>04: Bard(4): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br>05: Monk(1): M: (Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist)<br>06: Monk(2): Toughness, M: (Deflect Arrows)<br>07: Monk(3)<br>08: Monk(4): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>09: Arcane Archer(1): Blind Fight<br>10: Arcane Archer(2)<br>11: Arcane Archer(3)<br>12: Arcane Archer(4): DEX+1, Improved Critical: Longbow, (DEX=23)<br>13: Arcane Archer(5)<br>14: Arcane Archer(6)<br>15: Arcane Archer(7): Called Shot<br>16: Arcane Archer(8): DEX+1, (DEX=24)<br>17: Arcane Archer(9)<br>18: Arcane Archer(10): Skill Focus: Discipline<br>19: Monk(5)<br>20: Monk(6): DEX+1, M: (Knockdown, Improved Knockdown), (DEX=25)<br>21: Arcane Archer(11): Armor Skin<br>22: Arcane Archer(12)<br>23: Arcane Archer(13)<br>24: Arcane Archer(14): DEX+1, Epic Prowess, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=27)<br>25: Arcane Archer(15)<br>26: Arcane Archer(16)<br>27: Arcane Archer(17): Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>28: Arcane Archer(18): DEX+1, Great Dexterity II, (DEX=29)<br>29: Arcane Archer(19)<br>30: Arcane Archer(20): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=30)<br>31: Arcane Archer(21)<br>32: Arcane Archer(22): DEX+1, Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=32)<br>33: Arcane Archer(23): Great Dexterity V, (DEX=33)<br>34: Arcane Archer(24)<br>35: Arcane Archer(25)<br>36: Arcane Archer(26): DEX+1, Epic Fortitude, Great Dexterity VI, (DEX=35)<br>37: Arcane Archer(27)<br>38: Arcane Archer(28)<br>39: Arcane Archer(29): Epic Skill Focus: Discipline<br>40: Bard(5): DEX+1, (DEX=36)<br><br>Naked AC= 34, Mundane AB= 59, Naked HP= 390<br>Naked Saves= 28/21/39 Fort/Will/Reflex, BAB= 27<br><br>AC on DeX= 67, AB on DeX= 72/71 <br><br>Final Naked Skillz= Disc- 56, Hide/Move Silently- 56, Tumble- 53, UMD- 42, Spot- 43, Perform- 3<br><br>Put 23 into Disc on lvl 20 when u take the monk lvl and 42 into spot on lvl 39 when u take the final AA lvl. <br><br>NB: Do not make this build if you have any shred of decency in you and/or you can't take being flamed every 5 mins ^^<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 10/09/05 20:45</span></i></p>

You dont get lower ab with monk/wiz/AA. Go monk 8 wizard 2 AA 10 pre epic and then one more monk in epic. An even faster character also.

Not that effective either, you spend most your time running away from people and dont get that many shots off anyway. Imbue arrow is nice though.

You don't spend your life running away, you just get ahead of the opponent, stop, shoot, then go again when they start to get closer. Also if you go wiz you miss out on UMD and tumble.

Monk has tumble and you can still cast from scrolls because you are wizard, granted not all scrolls but most good ones anyway. So you dont miss that much.

Good point but that means u'd have to do one of two things- Take another wiz lvl pre epic to make up for the monk so u can take it on lvl 40 OR you can have more monk lvls (9 instead of 6) so you can get it on lvl 40. I was just keen on maxing AA lvls and having the 4 bard lvls pre epic for bab reasons. But that's just cos i'm a pvp builder... it really wouldn't make much diff otherwise.

Well you're right about something...it is a lame tactic! I see too many run &amp; shoot Archers on PvP...but it does work, that's for sure...someones justification for the tactic was "it's what Archers do, run &amp; shoot, run &amp; shoot"<br><br>...however if they'd checked their history, archers would traditionally advance in front of the melee troops &amp; fire a volley of arrows into the advancing enemy before letting the aforementioned melee troops rush passed them to engage the oncoming enemy...or they would stand fast atop battlements raining down death atop anyone foolish enough to attack the keep/castle...very little running...<br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!

I also want to know how to do this. Also if someone can explain how to get a called shot every time i try one would be nice. Often it just ends up being a normal shot which is very annoying.
