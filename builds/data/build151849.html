Based on advice from Syrath and Emrill, I've created another Monk/SD build with fighter lvls this time, and using kamas instead of unarmed strike. <br><br>I couldn't figure out how to get self conceal 5 using a human in this build, so I went with elf and will start getting an xp penalty around lvl 11 or so. If you guys have any advice on how to go human to avoid the penalty without nuetering all my starting stats or the self concealment...

Just realized that lvls 11 to 13 could be taken as shadowdancer, and lvls 18 to 20 as monk to prolong the xp penalty a few lvls. Also get some shadowdancer bonus feats earlier, but delays the bonus monk abilities... guess it's just a matter of playablity/preferences. Wouldn't affect the overall build at all.<br><br>riwipe

If you go this route, why not go CoT levels and take them in epic levels. You can then take all the bonus feats as great wisdoms.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

I took the fighter levels because I wanted not only the bonus feats to get the two weapon fighting feats faster, but also access to the specialization feats.

Cool, I have a similiar build I was working on.  Mine is a Halfling Monk 9/ fighter 6/ shadow dancer 25.  Yours has 2 higher ac then mine, but mine has 1 higher ab.  I made mine a dual wielder of kukri's.  Mine also has epic dodge and self conceal 5.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.
