It has been a looooong time since I have played but some friends are putting something together and I might actually have the time.  <br><br>Here's the skinny:<br><br>2 classes only.  No prestige classes.  Pure old school (the DM mentioned "rolling up" characters)<br><br>High magic server<br><br>I am not very good at managing a spellbook and lean toward sneakers.  When I last played, I had a lot of fun with a modified Pacifist Minstrel.<br><br>No desire to run a tank.<br><br>I was thinking about a simple Bard/Rogue  25/15, dedicated archer but am open to anything (cept a tank).  <br><br>There is not a healer in the group yet so I was considering a cleric as well.  (Please don't flail me for calling a cleric a healer ;P)  But again, not so good at managing the spells.  <br><br>Any one have some of these they never posted because that 3rd class *cough* tumble dump *cough*  made all the difference?

I have a challenge for you.  Read my guide in the guild.  Read Thax's druid guide (cuz he has GOOD info there for clerics too, if you read it right...) Then play a cleric PURE (with maybe 5-6 fighter levls for Epic weapon SPeicalization.  Put wisdom to 19 as you level and ALL your rest to strength.  The challenge, memorize NO heal spells (unless you are fighting Undeads).  mem ONLY one buff spell each (i list the most useful ones, but in high magic, you only need Div fav and Div power cuz you should have +10 in Epic lvls anyway).  And NEVER offer to heal your party.  NEVER offer to spell raise your party (grab Rez Rods!!  Much betta <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   And if you still need help, PM me.  I will teach you the mentality so you will be the *** KICKER, not the healer.  <br><br>3 classes arent necessary.  4 in nwn2 actually made things stupid for me.   The spellbook thing is easy with hot keys.  Trust me.  IF you get it right, you will have the most fun and be THE player in the group.  <br><br>And IF you got Dev crit...  sigh.  A GOD, literally!<br><br>But dont take my word for it.  Go do the bard (cuz bards, esp pure bards, literally ARE those ones relegated to heals and singing and stayin clear of battle!)..  but what do i know

*sigh*  I knew that bit about healers was a mistake.  <br><br>PW info -- only IGMS is nerfed, +20 weaponry, +6 gear, +4ish ability boost items, the requisite forge for custom gear (regen, vamp regen, freedom, haste, immun items, keen, extra damage types, you all know the deal), only pick pocket and dev crit disabled, alignment restrictions on classes, ready access to any scrolls, have seen +12 weapon in a drop at lower level, can rest every 2 IG hours....<br><br>I surely know how to hotkey, I just try to keep too many spells in my inventory for flexibility.  I have read the guides and suggestions and have spent an embarrasingly large amount of time reading the builds.  I am a fairly good builder utilizing 3 classes but always use a prestige class.<br><br>When using a cleric, I do heal and buff the group as much as possible.  Not looking to leave a smoking crater whenever I leave an area or be the man all the time.  I know how to do that a few ways and do when I solo and/or grind.  Yes, I have also used avado's techniques to great success and have a couple successful iconic builds in other classes.<br><br>This project is for a primarily RP campaign that will have multiple DMs at set times every week.  Eventhough this is a RP build, it never hurts to have great stats. I do not want to get stuck with a character that gets whomped and is too much like work to play.  <br><br>As I always have thought, it is possible to RP a character designed to wipe the floor with enemies but throwing down with some willy nilly RP character is suicide.  I am not a big fan of getting dead and watching everyone else killify stuff.<br><br>Sooooooooo, let's start over...<br><br>-- Looking for a bard heavy build in the setting described above with limitations of 2 classes and no prestige classes.<br>-- Would prefer a dedicated archer for RP purposes.<br>-- As in the original post NO DESIRE TO RUN A TANK<br>-- Does not have to be super deluxe build, just solid.<br>-- Not looking to max bard song as I feel 25 - 27 is enough and 100 perform is not worth the work to get. Not many perform boost items and those that are there are only +4 or so.<br>-- Think that with a dedicated archer, rogue is probably the better choice for damage output with the SAs<br>-- Indifferent to race and second class ... NO GNOMES!!<br>-- Not looking for a challenge when just asking for ideas.  I'll run an iconic cleric outside this campaign.<br><br>avado -- I appreciate what you are saying but posts like yours and players with the mentality you display are why I stopped playing for over a year and reading the forums.  I have read several of your posts in other threads and they are all the same.  "Clerics are the best, why do you waste your time with other classes, you are stupid if you disagree, blah, blah, blah...."<br><br>If you cannot help me or are unwilling to, take your argument with someone else somewhere else and stop hijacking threads with this cleric talk.  I'd also appreciate it if others who are arguing in other threads did not take the bait and bring their arguing into my thread.<br><br><br>NOTE TO MODERATORS:  I double posted the original in the build request section on account of I did not read properer.  Do with the posts as you will and my apologies.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Pipwhistle Goblinsbane on 10/07/09 05:56</span></i></p>

With the equipment you mention, bard is abetter bet than Cleric anyway.<br><br>I'm not sure what you need, really?<br><br>You seem to know what you want, like Bard24/Rogue16?<br> And when you already stated you wanted an archer, the obvious choice is to get your 16 CHA, a little STR to boost your damage a little, and just pump DEX. Go for Epic Dodge, of course with all the prereqs within easy reach. I'm sure you'll figure out how to level efficiently. All you must remember is to go with splits divisible by 4 pre-epic to preserve your BAB. Not sure but I'd probably do a 16/4 split pre-epic one way or the other.<br><br>You can justify 12/8 too of course, but I think it's better with 16/4 personally.<br>To avoid xp penalty you have to be Human or Halfling.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Thanks Grim.  That's about what I had in my head.  I was just looking to the pros to see if they had any whiz-bang ideas or odd takes on a 2 class build of this nature.  <br><br>This forum has provided me with a lot of inspiration and I know that some of you may have experience with something a little different.  As before this character will give me fits with spell selection.  I am  suprised no one pointed that out. That is just me being a sneaker at heart and preferring the stealth to the punch in the mouth.  Get in, get out, engage if you have to, come back as clean as you went in.<br><br>I am not unwilling to change the idea totally for a character that was fun to play because of the oddity.  I think that oddity is what makes it difficult for those that think in min/max terms.<br><br>Guess I was looking for a quirky sneaker build with emphasis on bard.

Hmmmm .. *quirky* sneaker...<br><br>I'm guessing in the high magic setting the sneak dmg of the rogue is going to be nerfed a bit by the damage bonuses available on all weapons, and crit immunities galore on anything that slightly matters? Also, there tends to be more than normal amount of TS, so the whole sneaky thing sometimes goes out the window. Thats been my experience, but then again i never lingered long in high magic env, i prefer +5(ish) pw's.<br><br>so lets explore the possibilities..<br><br>All the following can be built around a stealthy toon with a quirky twist. If theres an idea here you like, the guild can help flesh it out?<br><br>How about 23 Bard, 17 Druid.<br>- Go WIS all the way, with Zen Archery.<br>- Druid allows you to buff your Hide/MS, along side the Bardsong, assuming theres not alot of TS<br>- You can lay down some nice covering/disabling spells eg layered creeping dooms, grease, vine mine etc and then party can pick away<br><br>How about 16 Paladin, 24 Bard *ack*<br>- Go 14Wis, CHA most of the way<br>- Divine goodness for unresistable dmg<br>- Some nice buffing going on<br>- you can still hide/ms ok to land the first killer blows<br>- its an RP problem looking for a good story<br><br>How about 24 Bard, 16 Barbarian<br>- Go for Terrifying Rage? Not sure about high magic environment DC checks etc<br><br>Ranger/Bard = probably not worth it - theres some synergies, maybe is trapping something you could use effectively in your PW??<br><br>Fighter/Bard = booooooring
