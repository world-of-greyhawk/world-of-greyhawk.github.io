Any suggestions for a good template for a priest of Kord?  Chaotic-good means no monk or paladin, human, and primarily a fighter using a greatsword.  I've looked through the builds and don't see any that are quite right, but I could have missed some obvious things.

Looks good Mith. I could see anything that's oriented to battle. Perhaps a CLC/FTR/CoT? (Or Champion of Kord...)<br><br>Strength domain would be an obvious choice, assuming you want to try keep close to the suggested domains for roleplay.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Thanks much.  I'll look around and see if someone has done something like that already, otherwise I'll dork around with it for a bit.

You could use <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "222147", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Clangeddin's Wrath</a> as a template. Change the race to Human and the starting stats to:<br><br>STR 16<br>DEX 8<br>CON 16<br>INT 12<br>WIS 14<br>CHA 8<br><br>You'd need to look at either exchanging 2 STR raises for 2 CON raises to get the EDR feats or just not bothring with EDR. I'd also drop the Initiative feats, as they do not stack the way I originally assumed when I did the build.<br><br>I'd pick up KD as the Human bonus feat and GRT WIS as the CoT bonus feat to replace Superior Initiative. With 18 CLC levels, you'll be susceptible to being dispelled though, so if you want a CLC build that's only going to have to worry about Mord's and not Dispels, let me know and I'll try to work something up (perhaps FTR 4/CLC 26/CoT 10).<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I've been using that build, changed as you advised.  Wow!  Great build!  Does everything I was looking for and more.  Thanks kindly!<br>_________________<br>"The difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between the lightning and the lightning bug." -- Twain
