<b>The Myrmidon Eternal</b><br><br>"...they were an Axe from the days of Old, when the the tombs of the Dwarflords were kingdoms unto themselves, and whose stewardship was placed in the granite grip of the Revengers of Moradin, a Circle of 12 who guarded even unto death the untold wealth and storied honor of the bygone Mountain Kings.

When you have a natural AB of 42 and a natural AC of 40 in mundane armor, and you can deliver 100+ points on a basic critical with no items, and are immune to sneaks and crits, you have to step back for a moment and say, "What the crap?"

Looks sweet Grizz. Only thing I might suggest as a tweak is perhaps taking FTR 15 at around level 32 or so, just to top out Discipline ranks, then move the PM levels accordingly. Delays your last Energy Resist feat by 2 levels.<br><br>This really looks good. Even though you have a long delay between Bard 3 and 4, you don't miss out on much, as the FTR levels capture Discipline and the PM levels take care of Spellcraft. Tumble isn't that urgent, since the PM AC boosts more than take care of your AC needs. As for delaying the UMD dump, you really only need it for Monk and Cleric items, which are generally just bonus material as opposed to necessities.<br><br>Well done. Very effective.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I did a build very, very close to this called the Introspective Necromancer. In the updated version I never posted it had 5 more AC but 2 less AB, and probably didn't have the same damage potential. The offensive ability of this build is awing when you look at its defenses.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

You gotta know by now that the Dwarflord is well read. Myrmidon comes from Greek mythology. One myth has them as a race of people that Zeus created from ants. They were extremely hardy and effective warriors and fanatically loyal. Achilles commanded and led a group of them at Troy.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Very true, Cin.  <br><br>But also, for those who can harken back to the days of yore-- the days of 1st Edition, when the player's handbook cover was a giant statue of an efreet with thieves crawling upon his shoulders to pry out the gem-ensocketed eyes-- one will recall that each class had titles given to them as they leveled up.  A first lvl Ftr was a "Veteran", and a 1st lvl Magic-user was a "Prestidigatator,", et cetera.  And it was, I believe, at level 6 when a Fighter was given the title of "Myrmidon".  Of the 9 titles given to fighters, that was always my favorite of the bunch.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Now that you've mentioned it, I remember that from the book, but I'd have never come up with it without that. I have those old books (PHB, DMG, MM) along with the greyhawk map, and tonnes of modules stored away somewhere and have often thought about getting my hands on them again.
