I know there are some WM/Bard/RDD builds out there but I haven’t seen any with both Dev Crit AND Epic Damage Reduction; this one has both.  Saving Throws and AC are low but there aren’t enough feats to really change this.

You get style points for spear, I'll say that. Even if this is a world that has some of the nice custom 1-handed spears made. I think for a flappy wings, it's nice. If I didn't hate RDD, I'd be inclined to give it a go. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">

Dem pre-epics in epic be awfully painful.  You could at least drop toughness and prowess and pick up two more great STRs.  You'd lose 40 HP, but gain one and a half damage.  Plus, you'd be spared the indignity of at least one of those pre-epics in epic.

How would dropping prowess help? Toughness would be possible, taking Improved Crit there. I guess you have to ask if the ignominy of the pre-epic feat in the epic levels is worth 40pts in terms of playability. Now I agree once you get full flappy wings, and DR, you'll have so many effective HP it won't matter. But at the point he takes toughness it would help his playability, I think. *shrugs*

OUCH!  I looked at it the first time and said, "Hey a rdd/wm!  Havent seen one in a long time! Nice!"  THEN, then, i noticed that there were NO bard lvls in epic!  ouch.  In a build like this, you really need the skill dumps, imho.  otherwise, not too shabby.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/28/06 00:22:49 (GMT) -- TyrTemplar<br><br>This post is for general information purposes only, and does not constitute a legal opinion or render any legal advice.

And. yeah, the lack of bard skill dumps does hurt.  You could drop three WM levels for three epic bard dumps (heh, heh).  It would cost you one feat (maybe that's where toughness goes), and one AB, for a big boost to tumble, spellcraft, and UMD.  I'd do it in a heartbeat.

I agree on the bard skill dumps for sure. It gives the character a lot more versatility as well. Tumble, more UMD, better bard song. So yep, I'd go bard 8 too.
