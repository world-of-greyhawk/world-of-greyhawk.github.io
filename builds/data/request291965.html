You know, there's a thing we call the <a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">build searcher</a> by pulse cap, why don't you try it out if you're looking for so many builds?<br><br>The only smiter I've made (and I usually don't look for other people's smiter builds, it isn't really the type of build I use so I don't know more) is this:<br> <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "236754", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Double Smiter (Paladin 20 / Harper Scout 5 / Blackguard 15)</a><br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Does this server have any forums of its own? If so, it might be a good place to ask about builds that are good on that server. If smiters are popular, then I imagine the best/most optimal builds have been worked out already.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
