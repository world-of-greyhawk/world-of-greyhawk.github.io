<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>Here's another build I had came up with at someone else's request, so I figured I should post it here as well.

Is the damage including Cleric buff spells or just defensive stance, they seem a little lower that i would have expected!!<br><br>(Aid, bless, prayer, divine favor and such)<br><br>The end effect is not much different than my "Raging Dwarf" even though we took rather different classes.

In that case, add 1 point to damage for the STR, 80 to the HP, 4 to the AC.  It is possible I missed a buff here and there, but I don't think so.  I did however do the computations by hand.  When I get a chance, I'll check it out in game and post the actual damage diplayed.

for a buffing cleric, I try to get at least 15 levels of cleric.  this gives you 8th level spells (mass heal), but that's not the reason I go that far.  The real reason is to max out the buffing spells.<br><br>greater magic weapon, magic vestiment, divine favor, etc... all gain bonuses based on caster level and they max out at lvl 15.  If you don't take that many levels you can't get the most out of your buffs. (get +4 instead of +5 for these buffs).<br><br>The exception is shield of faith, which maxes out at lvl 18.

The problem is just the tightness of the build makes it difficult.  But you could drop, say, dev crit and pick up some cleric levels from fighter levels and some extra wisdom.  Or you could scrap some DR and con and do likewise.  Honestly, I made this for someone else who had specific requests, as opposed to for myself (you'll note it's the only non-rogue build from me, especially after I add in my next build).  For my own personal tastes, I'd probably change a number of things (I'm not that big a DwD fan honestly, not because I don't think it's strong, just a matter of personal taste).  But yeah, that is one of a number of things you could do with this build to enhance various aspects of it.<br><br>Steve<br><br>Edit: I might try some sort of Cleric/Barb/CoT build..sort of like a cleric version of Martin's Raging Dwarf, although the XP penalties might be a pain...Hrm, might be interesting, but I'll have to check it out and see.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 05/20/05 21:23</span></i></p>
