This has been asked so many times, you probably aren't going to get much of a response.  That said, when PvP is the only concern, not much can beat <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_exaltedsorceress.html" target="_blank">The Exalted Sorceress</a>.  It goes without saying that a mediocre build in the hands of someone who understands the strengths and weaknesses of the character will almost always win over an uber build in the hands of someone with less experience.<br>_________________<br>There's always time to procrastinate.

Unless your going for RDD, I think Sorc is a waste of time. If your going to be a mage, you need the strongest spells at your finger tips, and Wizard provides them. Wizard and Pale Master are pretty good combination, because the Palemaster makes you immuned to those pesky crit. attacks. Though, I would be hesitant to add a single Paladin class to it. What is the point of that anyway?<br><br>~Nelos<br>_________________<br>You can't kill what was simply never there. . .

Oh, I see. The one Paladin is for Divine Grace. Since thats based upon Chras, then I guess it would be a good combination along with sorc. So tt's defiantly not as pointless as I had believed. <br><br>~Nelos<br>_________________<br>You can't kill what was simply never there. . .

It also gives you access to Martial Weapons Proficiency and Heavy Armor Proficiency. Not to mention a skill dump in Discipline half way through your progression.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 03/06/06 23:14</span></i></p>
