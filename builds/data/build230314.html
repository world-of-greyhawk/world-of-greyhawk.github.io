All that Con with no EDR3.. I have a super masochist Sorc 27 PM 10 BG 3 with EDR3 and Divine Shield somewhere.. EDR3 is a kickass addition to a mage lol. Even when the warding packs in and you're left suckin up the blows you still absorb 9 points of physical damage ^_^<br><br>-DaMouse

First of all, it would me much easier to read this if you post using the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "219409", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>free build template</a><br><br>It will also help you to remember to include all of the stats, like unbuffed AC, AB, saves, unbuffed HP, etc. (none of which were included).<br><br>That said, this build has a lot of room for improvement, at least from what I can read of it.  With such a low charisma, everyone will be making your saves except on a natural 1 autofail, and so the spell focus feats become useless.  Just stick to the typical no save spells.  Also, I assume this is a straight level 40 build, but it is going to be awfully difficult to level this between level 4 and 14.  You do not learn any new spells when taking levels in pale master, and I am not sure whether or not you can make these up if you return to sorceror later (although you can use the spell slots if you have the approprite metamagic feat, because you do still gain spells per day).  Wizards can get around this by learning from scrolls, but sorcerors can only learn on level up, so they get the shaft.<br><br>You mentioned "that reflex save," which we don't know what it is, but it probably isn't high enough to justify evasion.  I doubt you'll be making any saves from anything but yourself.<br><br>This build wouldn't be too difficult to fix, though, I don't think. As the previous poster mentioned, take EDR III, drop the spell focus feats, move PM to epic, and focus on throwing up damage shields when in combat (such a tactic benefits from a low AC).  You can throw some missile storms at your opponents too, if you want to speed things up a bit.<br>_________________<br>There's always time to procrastinate.

So you can use the elemental sheild and o0ther such buffs and tou'll never get hurt also if you improve your reflex save you can deflect with evasion almost any offensive magic spell with reeflex save in them which is alot<br>_________________<br>"Ïf thê øñlÿ wäÿ før mê tø bê wïth ÿøù ïs ïñ ä drêäm thêñ lêt mê drêäm førêvêr"<br><br>"Habits are like a comfy chair easy to get in to and hard to get out of"

Make sure you take Blooded and Thug then as well as Improved Initiative does not stack with Superior Initiative.<br><br>You could of course raise your DEX as this improves your initiative as well.
