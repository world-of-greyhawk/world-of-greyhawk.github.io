More accurately I mean "Is discipline woth taking in dex-based characters?". I recently read Grimnir's latest build (Harbinger of sorrow), and he said this statement (although, I may be quoting it in the wrong context):<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/17/06 13:16:07 (GMT) -- Grimnir77<br>43 discipline basically equals no discipline. </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Now while this maybe only referring to this build (seeing as it isn't a dex-based fighter, and is based around buffing, cursing and hiding), it would still be nice to know if anyone else shares this view.<br><br>I'm currently working on a new dex-based character, who will eventually have 42 ranks in discipline, but only 13 str. <br><br>I won't go into to much detail (until I post it that is), but seeing as the character has rogue levels (and has a few other useful skills that are untouched) would these points be better spent somewhere else?<br><br>To any repliers, just try to take this post one-step-at-a-time <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> .

His point is that Discipline checks happen against the opponent's attack roll. In almost every environment, at level 40, everyone will have (a lot) higher unmodified attacks than 43. Ergo, a Disc of 43 is the same as no discipline, since you'll always fail the check anyway <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  Especially when we calculate buffs etc., and add the attack roll.<br>_________________<br>"We keep our Feast of Feasts, sure of our bourne,<br>                 Our aims self-same:<br>The Guest of Guests, friend <i>Zarathustra</i>, came!<br>The world now laughs, the grisly veil was torn,<br>And Light and Dark were one that wedding-morn."<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 06/19/06 10:55</span></i></p>

I understood what he meant fin (thanks anyway), I was just asking for other people's opinions. So I take it then that you agree with Grim? <br><br>I'm not disagreeing with Grim or anything (he hasn't steered me wrong yet), I'm just contemplating rebuilding a character and it would be nice to know where people stand on value of discipline in dex-based characters.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Big Meph on 06/19/06 11:01</span></i></p>

It can be worth it, particularly if you have +discipline equipment available and/or use +str equipment as well.<br><br>You might not be easily able to resist attacks from extremely high-AB characters or on very high-magic worlds, but you should be able to resist attacks from moderate AB characters (like many sneaks and monks) at least some of the time if you have +discipline gear.<br><br>Spellcraft might be a better skill investment if you have limited points and can't take both, but 43 discipline isn't the same as no discipline since 43 discipline + 6 from buffed strength + X in discipline equipment is a lot higher and more likely to be helpful than 0 discipline + buffs and gear.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

It is a little bit out of context, if you read the whole phrase I elaborate on ways to get it above 43. But I stand firm on my point, 43 is a waste. Many arcane caster builds state it as a strongpoint,(like the Exalted) but it's truly only a waste. If you can raise it above 43, then that's another matter. But it is NOT likely for Arcane casters and DEX-builds to raise STR much, and discipline items usually have to give way to other items.<br><br>Discipline in the Harbinger of sorrow is only worth it if you either take ESF:Discipline or get good boosts from items. He even has the bardsong to help, so ESF + bardsong would make it worthwhile.<br><br>43 points in discipline= totally wasted. If not, please tell me what good they do in a high AC dex-build?<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Well in theory if you have a very high AC for any reason, there's little point in having the discipline skill because anyone who can beat your AC with an attack roll at -4 will surely beat your discipline check unless it's phenomenally high.<br><br>But there are the 20s to consider.  Ie, people who can't hit you normally because of your high AC can still hit you on a 20.  And if they can't hit you without rolling a 20, it doesn't matter what penalties they incur so there's no point in them NOT spamming you with knockdowns (which will make you easier to hit if one lands).<br><br>But that doesn't mean you won't be able to resist that kind of KD attacking with a lower discipline.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

For a dex-build that has Epic Dodge, generally I don't think discipline is worth it. The reason is that your AC tends to be &gt;63, so any KD attempt that hits you will overcome the discipline check. Having ED means that you are unlikely to be hit on a natural 20, since it actually takes 2 of them in a single round to succeed (rare).<br><br>Now, some possible exceptions:<br>1 - You have an alternate shape with high strength (i.e. DS). Then even though it may useless in your normal form, it will be good in the alternate shape.<br>2 - You have access to powerful discipline-boosting items, i.e. Epic Gloves of Discipline (+30 to discipline).<br>3 - You are in a low magic setting where even a dex-based character can't get their AC much above 50 (i.e. your discipline roll will have a chance to succeed against rolls that can hit your AC).<br>4 - You are dex-based, but don't have ED, and/or face mobs of weaker enemies who will generate enough 20's to be annoying.<br><br>Even if one of those is the case, I recommend taking ESF: discipline, and perhaps SF: discipline if you want to make it useful (those 2 can get you to 56, with buffed Str that's 62, which is high enough to be useful if your AC is less than 82).<br><br>And most of my dex-based character do buff both Str and Dex. They usually have UMD, so get +3 Dex from monk boots, and wear gauntlets of dex to get to +10, with a potion/scroll of Cat's Grace to guarantee max. That leaves the belt slot open for a Belt of Giant Str, and a potion/scroll of Bull's Str can max that as well. Now, if you are in a low-magic setting where monk boots don't buff dex at all and gauntlets are limited to +3, then you would want the belt as well, but if gauntlets go to +5 or more, and the monk boots give you 3, you are generally better off with a belt of str than agility.<br><br>TM

Problem with listen is that sneaks still get a sneak/death attack in when you hear them while they don't from spot....listen is great for bards thanks to amplify and clairaudience boosting it to +30 and song boosting it further but if you ain't a bard I'd favour spot over listen personally.<br><br>As for discipline, it's not generally that useful unless you can get it &gt; your AC...though making sure that Mr. Low-AB-Monk can't KD you on a 20 or when you're flatfooted (think WoF) is always a nice thing.  If I go for discipline in any build I always make sure to take ESF unless REALLY pushed for feats.
