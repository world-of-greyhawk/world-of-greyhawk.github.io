Barbarbian/Cleric/Cot has other options, too.  The DR 11/- is nice, but not all that great.  By dropping CON to 16 to start and raising INT to 12, you get 43 more skill points, +3 STR, and four additional epic feats.  Or you could start with 14 WIS as well and gain +6 stats in other areas to start, and use the COT levels to raise your WIS to 18.  Then you could take epic skill focus Intimidate and epic reflexes.  Combined with 40 ranks in spellcraft, you'd never fail a save.  By Dropping CoT levels to 8 you could raise barb level to 16 and get an additional rage.  Or stay at level 15 Barb and raise Cleric levels to 17 for a few Implosions.  Can run for a long time on +12 max CON and STR cap by casting bull's/endurance, then extended aura of vitality, then greater rage (+2+4+6=12).  This would raise his Dev Crit DC to 45.  Could also raise DEX or CHA a bit instead (dex for reflex saves, CHA for Terrifying and making the War Domain Power last longer).  Or you could forego Dev crit if it is disabled and raise CON to obscene levels.  <br><br>I think it's a pretty sweet class combination and I'm surpised there haven't been more builds based on it.<br>_________________<br>Vulcano's <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&amp;id=6522" target="_blank">Bard Studio</a> (in beta, 1.67).  *Updated*  Compose, play, and save your own bard music dynamically in game!

Neat, very good leveling progression, too bad CON and STR end at odds, dev crit enters very late, and it's at minimum DC.<br><br>Hmmmm, I don't see much use on Improved Iinvisibilty with a melee like this guy, might work better with Healing Domain methinks.<br><br>I like the DR version, noticing that your AC very low.

With a mountain of hit points and the ability to full heal himself at least 7 times (4xHeal, 3x Greater restoration), it will take a very long time to kill him.  He can sustain damage that would kill most other characters; effectively around 10,000 hit points between the misses, the DR, and 7 heals.  Of course, the additional heals from Healing domain could come in handy, too, but one concealment effect can prevent a lot more than 5 additional heals would provide.  Concealment also applied to touch and ranged touch attacks (such as Harm), so it can prevent even more.<br>_________________<br>Vulcano's <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&amp;id=6522" target="_blank">Bard Studio</a> (in beta, 1.67).  *Updated*  Compose, play, and save your own bard music dynamically in game!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Vulcano on 04/11/06 21:38</span></i></p>

I meant in the sense that Improved Invisibility is not a full concealment and it can be dispelled with True Sight. Anyway, I just re-read the description, and you keep the concealment even after loosing invisibility by attacking...... bad moment to realize that.

Personally, against human opponents, I'd drop the DR and CON and ramp up STR, as I stated above as options for this three class combo.  With +12 STR for extended periods of time, the STR is not *that* low unless we're talking about a higher magic item world.
