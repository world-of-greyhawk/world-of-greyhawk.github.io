Does anyone know a uberly high saves build besides Pali/BG/COT since BG you'd have to have a alignment change, I just want to stick to one alignment, preferably evil or neutral. Any Ideas?

Well if you want to stick to Neutral or Evil that is gonna make things difficult. Evil is Blackguard, but that means no CoT or Paladin. Neutral can be for CoT but that means no Paladin or Blackguard. And well, you didnt mention good and that is only thing for Paladin. So that kinda limits how high your saves can get. What do you consider high saves to be for this build?

How much is uber for you?<br><br>Paladin/CoT or Blackguard/CoT by itself already has awesome saves... Sorcerer or Bard comes to mind as third class...<br><br>You can also kind of boost a bit your saves with Monk levels pre-epic, since Monk gets all the saves as mayor (or however it is called, the three increase by the high schedule).<br><br>CoT sometimes is useless if you can get saves from items, since they don't stack, Blackguards and Paladins CHA to saves do stack, so you can take CoT out of the builds if you get high saves from items.<br><br>Other than that I'd say that one of the best high saves builds is a Druid 14 / Monk 2 / CoT 24 with Dragon Shape, the saves of that thing are really high since you get high DEX and CON shifted modifiers, and your WIS has to be minimum 30 (so DEX, CON and WIS boost saves considerably), though it's not precisely the best spread for power, the saves on that build are truly high.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Lawful Neutral Monk/Sorc/CoT can easily get all saves to about 40 un-buffed; and still be playable. With Divine Wrath you would also get an extra +9 (lvl 20 CoT) to your saves.<br><br>What is your definition of high saves?  (Obviously 60s are; but as you said you don't want that build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  )<br>_________________<br>-4SakN<br><i>"never kiss a girl whose brothers have knife scars." <br>"never gamble without knowing a back way out."</i><br>-Robert Jordan

Still no answer from the OP, but high saves are those that let you save every time the save roll is made (logic says that), most of the high DCs reach about 50 or so, so 50 is sure enough, you can have it even lower against spells if you have Spellcraft. I think I remember the "highest saves build" had about 90 or so... so unnecessary high saves, since the highest DC I've ever made was a Stunning Fist with 63 DC, the dragon CoT gets the saves in the 50s so that's high enough, but 40s is already good enough for most saves anyway.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

That was my thought too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   The above Sorc/Monk/CoT I spoke of would have a 8 to Spells as well; so I would guess it would be pretty solid. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br><br>If the OP ever comes back that is <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"><br>_________________<br>-4SakN<br><i>"never kiss a girl whose brothers have knife scars." <br>"never gamble without knowing a back way out."</i><br>-Robert Jordan
