It had been a long war.  For the last remnants of this shattered kingdom, it had been a battle they could not win.  The King of the North had been waging war on East, West and South, of the West existed nothing but broken monuments, and those things too big or ugly to steal.<br><br>Time passed, and with it the dust settled.  The North saw many victorious battles, rudely cutting a path through the land, washing it in blood and treachery at every step.<br>A grand ball had been announced! A banquet in honor of his recent 'victory', hosted by the Northern King himself.  The North settled on it's lourels, no thought spared for the vanquished West - for they were the enemy, were they not.  Certainly beneath them, these West Kingdomers.<br><br>And so it was that the Nothern king's HomeGuard did not pay particular attention to the flicker in the candlelight that evening; the slight disturbance in the shadows did not cause any alarm.  Snapping to attention, a lone guard patrolling the outer gates saw a brief flash of color - red, crimson blood - his own, flashing before him.<br>"Sleep well, Northerner" said a soft voice, floating in the wind of his last breath.<br>The Inner Gates loomed ahead.  The hooded elf blended into the shadows and approached the doomed castle.  Tonight, it's walls would see the price of their betrayal...<br><br>Some disclaimers<br>1) Compensation for mental anguish due to the bad story outline will be limited to 'oops'.<br>2) Been playing this build a few months, thought I would post it and try get some idea's on improvement.  Have no idea if something similar exists, could not see anything on brief scan of current builds.  <br>....    ....    ....    ....    ....    ....    ....    ....    ....    ....    ....    ....    ....    ....    ....    ....    ....    ....<br><br>2.

Half of ALL attacks miss you, overridden only by blindfight (not even truesight helps your poor hapless enemies).<br>2) Epic Dodge. First successful hit for whoever you are currently engaging (the boss or highest ab mob member hopefully) will miss. Worth it's weight in gold.<br>3) GOOD AC. You can acheive a very good ac with umd'd items.<br><br>ITEMS YOU SHOULD GET:<br>1) Mage Sequencer items. Store up spells and use em as needed.<br>2) Scrolls - undeath's eternal foe; GMW, Flameblade, ShadowShield and Greater Stoneskin.<br>3) Dex items - max it out if possible,<br>4) Monk items. Think monk robes, monk boots if better than rogue ones.<br><br>Mobs you should avoid if possible:<br>1) Casters. Your saves will suck, but you have defensive roll AND slippery mind to help. They don't help much, just a little.<br>2) Dragons UNLESS you can get +6 or better weapons. Having said that, on the PW I play this build took on a particularly nasty dragon toe-to-toe with no top level items whatsoever.. a pretty hard thing to do, for even the high palemaster builds.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 11/15/05 01:12</span></i></p>

Nice ED/SC5 Rogue. Thanks for reposting. I'll call off my toad familiar <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>Some questions for you....<br><br>Why'd you take Exp and Imp Expertise in front of TWF and Imp. TWF? Is AC more important at that level than number of attacks?<br><br>With ED and SC5 I think I'd like Epic Prowess over Armor Skin. Thoughts?<br><br>Note your dual-wielding AB will probably be different than posted depending on weapon of choice. If you focus in Rapier and dual-wield it, you will suffer a greater penalty (-4 to each attack I think) since it's a medium-sized weapon. If you focus in Short Sword, you can dual wield with only the -2 penalty. Of course you could focus in Rapier, but hold a small weapon in the offhand (mace, short sword, hand axe, etc) but this would reduce your offhand AB.<br><br>PS - Nice writeup. It helps people interested in playing this build.<br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br>Intelligent design is neither.

First off<br>Grip, thanks for fixing that up - makes it a bit less chunky in here <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br>Kaliban, thanks for the feedback!<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Epic Prowess over Armor Skin</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Actually that would push the ab up nicely without hampering the build too much; good idea.  Might even be worthwhile going rapier then, with the slightly better crit range it would be a bit easier on you with DR opponents.<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Note your dual-wielding AB will probably be different than posted depending on weapon of choice</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Mentioned the Rapier difference up top (you get a -2 penalty already from dualwielding shortswords); just put it as a comment though, but yeh I should've highlighted it a bit better.<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; Exp and Imp Expertise in front of TWF and Imp.

Imp Expert and Expertise are though, and as I was wanting them I took them there.<br>Here's the kicker though:  I rarely use the imp expert; even in tough fights (switch out to shield and shadow evades).

Actually, yep both of ye hit it on the nose there.<br>1) Fighter xp penalties would have made the build a bit tougher to make through most of it's life<br>2) Saves were a consideration, though to be honest without some good cha items, that ended up not working well.<br><br>Another reason, was the feats at the last two levels in epic character level carried on with the same progression as fighter pre-epic (fighter feats start to wane in epic, iirc).<br><br>But, a fighter would have little benefit (I think?) over cot here though.  Weapon Spec, true, but anything else?<br><br>IKD over Imp Expertise... very definitely a good idea; will need to test (iirc they both are in the same list of feats)

If you're only taking Fighter/CoT to ten levels max - the Fighter gets one more feat than CoT and access to weapon specialization (helps with damage output, especially with dexxers) but CoT gets improved saves and a better save progression, like wearing a + to saves item all the time (CoT's saves improvement counts towards the saves cap IIRC - so less useful if save boosters are common). Past ten levels, CoT gets bonus feats every 4th level while fighter still gets feats every +2 levels but the saves keep improving.<br><br>It's something of a case of defense vs. offense (and possibly considering EXP-Penalties).<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.
