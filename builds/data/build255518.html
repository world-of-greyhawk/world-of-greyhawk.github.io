Piercing and Slashing, Smiting and Fighting the Forces of Evil PvM (1-40) or PvP<br><br>THE LIBERATOR (Angel of Redemption)<br>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar<br><br>Concept: This is a Risen Angel, bringer of hope, rescue and freedom.<br><br>Strengths and Weaknesses: <br>•	This is a Great Smiter for the forces of good, with very good, highly buffable AB and damage; as such, this character can readily hold his/her own, not being reliant on smite attacks alone; <br>•	At the same time, with Great Smite X (and with what appears to be the highest AB of its class) has the very real potential to dish out some exciting damage (&gt;1100).

Special thanks and acknowledgments must go out to everyone here who commented on my builds in the Templar series, and including (but not limited to) Mick Dagger, Dwarflord, Mith, Avarielo, Thax, Avado, Cinn, Xylo, Nimueh, Samphus (and so, so many others). Special thanks must go out to Finn, Grim and Kail, for their ongoing encouragement and own very inspirational smiting characters (we know who they are <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   , which inspired me on these latest two characters - thanks, everyone. <br><br>As always, I welcome your eyes, thoughts, and continuing feedback. ~ Tyr <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 10/13/06 05:39</span></i></p>

Start with STR 16 or even 15 and pump up INT and CON. INT 9 btw is useless, DEX 9 makes more sense to help you achieve 12 with a potion of Cat's Grace. Something like STR 16, DEX 9, CON 12, INT 10 for example or even STR 15 and either INT 12 or CON 14<br><br>Also, I'd drop some Great Smites and get in AS and Great STR to make up for the loss with changing starting stats. Something like Great Smite VI should do: you get AS; 2 Great STR (starting STR at 16) and one Great CHA to round up CHA. Scythe is really stylish but I think that Greatsword or Scimitar would be better.<br><br>You can feel the lack of Paladin and all the good buffs in this smiter. Nice concept anyhow.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 09/25/06 11:58:10 (GMT) by xitooner<br><br>I find its better to be flexible, THINK, and know your enemy.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

As with your other build, I'm not 100% sure why this is an align-changer.  Using paladin instead of blackguard would preserve the base AB and cha-to-saves aspect, and actually result in stronger smites as well (stacking with COT levels).  Using rogue would open up a much wider skillset and stronger sneak attacks (though at the cost of hitpoints).<br><br>But I like the focus on getting great smite 9 or 10 on a character with a base 40+ AB.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Thanks, guys <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     <br><br>OK, maybe you're right re: paladin; thinking was, on the pair, one angel rises, the other falls - but you both make great points. And so, here it is: with pally and other adjustments (i.e., start stats (more HPs, more skills, and even higher saves, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">      As for AC, picked up bastard sword so as to enable board use (oh, but that scythe, indeed, so very stylish -and crit multiplier was nice, too --as such, doesn't get the 1100 on one crit smite, but *only* near-700 on a crit w. bastard sword instead (yeah, yeah ... over it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">      ) <br><br>Otherwise, same great AB (highest for a great smiter still), and other goodies ... (gonna repost this one anew, since the combo's changed, but thought I'd puts it here first, so we can have us a gander -- and yeah, pally works better me thinks, too (thanks, guys -- appreciate your thoughts, as always - look forward to your continuing thoughts <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     <br><br>Revised<br>Champion of Torm(22), Fighter(10), Paladin(8)<br>Race: Human / Alignment: Lawful Good<br><br>I.
