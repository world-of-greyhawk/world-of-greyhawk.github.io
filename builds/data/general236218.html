Allow me to be blunt:<br><br>Please join the new pre-epic builder's guild and post your ideas there for all of us to use. <br><br>The epic builder's forum has been a tremendous resource for a long time.  Great thought, strategy and imagination are on display here.  I ask that you same builders now turn your talents to helping those of us who play at lower levels; specifically level 1 through level 28.  <br><br>The pre-epic guild is designed to be a resource for:<br><br>All people new to the game, especially people new to  AD&amp;D 3rd edition or new to AD&amp;D period.<br><br>People who enjoy playing single player modules such as the OC, Pirates, HotU, etc.; experienced or not. <br><br>People who enjoy playing on persistant worlds that start your character at low level and make you work to get to level 28 (or so).<br><br>Role-playing character ideas.<br><br>Powergaming at lower levels.<br><br>Non-powergaming. <br><br>So far we've got six members and some great build ideas are already up.  Check us out; we welcome any and all build ideas as long as they are somewhat playable at lower levels and are capped at 28.  <br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Son_of_Vazkor on 04/05/06 00:13</span></i></p>

I'm not "promoting" a different guild as such, I'm humbly requesting that the excellent members of this guild impart some of their wisdom by posting custom, low level build ideas on the pre epic guild pages.  I don't see these two guilds as being in competition, one is focused on high level builds and one on low. If any member or owner of the epic builders guild is offended then I offer my sincere apology.  By all means lock/delete this thread if it is in bad taste. <br><br>As for whether the pre-epic guild is truly pre-epic (being capped at level 28, not 20), well I leave that to others to ponder. The pre-epic guild is designed to be a resource for anyone who enjoys playing from level 1 up, through modules and those pertinant PWs.

I don't think there's any problem advertising your guild here. I think the idea itself is reasonably solid, too. I'd offer up some builds, but I've already posted a bunch in the Epic guild and I try to design mine so they're playable from level 1 anyway, so in many cases, I'd just end up offering a truncated version of the same builds. <br><br>*shrug* Perhaps I'll give it some thought though.<br>_________________<br>Where I'm playing now: <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk.</a>

Nearly all of mine are built with pre-epic in mind.  A level 40 build should not presume that it is built for a level 40 environ.

I build most my builds playable too (all?), but i would still do some things different if ending the build at 28. You know, not desperately taking great dexes for reaching SC for example. Playable is one thing.

But level 20 is a rather unwieldy stopping point.  The pre-epic builders guild is designed primarily for people who enjoy playing through the original modules, up to and including HotU, hence the cap of level 28.  Also intended for anyone playing on PWs that start you at low level. Again, I will leave it for others to ponder whether the guild is suitably named or not. Also, you need not build to level 28 - that's just the cap. If you have a build for a level 20 cap PW then by all means post it.  if you have a level 18 build specific for the OC then post it.  If you have a level 15 to 28 build for HotU ... <br>But the theme of the guild is "play all the way," meaning play from level 1, so for the most part that is what you will see there in the way of builds. <br>Again, you guys are the experts and I would love to see you apply your imagination to this new challenge.  However I am avoiding individual invites because I don't want to be a pest.  I hope this thread has peaked your collective interest and you will check out what we have so far.

I must echo Grimnir's thoughts in response to Cin Din and the Grizzled One.  Things like epic dodge and outsider shape have to be carefully considered when your character is capped at 28; quite simply, one must ask if it is worth the sacrifice in other areas.  And feats like terrifying rage become even more valuable because you don't have to sacrifice playability to get them.  And if you build your character around a level 24 feat, is it worth it for the three levels that you get to use it?  <br>Also, the PEB guild welcomes all RP ideas and even single or 2 class builds; I don't expect to see stricly 3 class powergaming.  When I think of how many different single class rogues I've played, I realize that every class has infinite identities.
