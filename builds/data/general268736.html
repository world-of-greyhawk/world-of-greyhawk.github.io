I am having trouble trying to get a powerful archer to work. Every time I get a good AB I get bad AC. And vice versa. I keep on shifting from offense to defense. Any suggestions on a good strong build?<br>_________________<br>Join the Guilds that can make you and your guild a champion!

If you want high AC and high-ish AB, go 10 Monk, 1 Bard (or Wiz.), 29 AA.<br><br>Probably other versions, though that seems to work the best.  Granted it does not get Epic Dodge, but has high spot/listen/heal skills.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By mantis3 on 03/18/07 22:22</span></i></p>

Well, you could go 7 Monk, 2 Wizard (or Bard, though I prefer Wiz.), 7 AA, 1 Monk, then 3 more AA.  Post epic, AA till 40 taking 9th Monk at 32 and 10th at 39.  Monk could be taken at 27/37 as well (but to get the most discipline, I'd take it at 39).<br><br>Or, you could gimp yourself on BAB in order to gain +1 damage and +1 AB from 29th AA level.  Same concept, except it gets one less skill dump post-epic (Monk for disc./tumble).  Basically, you'd go 9 Monk, 1 Wizard, 10 AA pre-epic, then all AA post-epic except a 10th Monk level at 37-39.<br><br>Keep in mind, this is Wisdom based so you'd focus your feats/ability points into Wisdom, and be sure to take Zen Archery pre-epic.  More Monk levels over the AA could be favourable in certain situations, for the monk speed/AC (something like 18 Monk, 21 AA, 1 Wizard, which nets one more AC, 60%+ movement speed, and Empty Body for 50% conceal while losing 4 AB/Damage from Enhanced Arrows, and a couple points of Dex from Great Dex feats - AA bonus feats).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By mantis3 on 03/18/07 22:32</span></i></p>

The usual Fighter 10 / Wizard 1 / Arcane Archer 29 never fails, but I wonder, how do you get a low AC on a heavy AA build? they're all DEX based builds so it should be for the least decent.<br><br>What does happens pretty often is that all that DEX is useless when flanked, which is annoying, I've had good experience with a Barbarian 16 / Wizard 1 / Arcane Archer 23 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   it gives you Uncanny Dodge, Greater Rage for HP and damage on mighty bows and Terrifying Rage isn't bad either plus a minor DR.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/19/07 04:04</span></i></p>

You don't really need to focus on AB with an AA build.. I don't understand why people say stuff like "omg 70AB with bow and rapid shot no equipment I roxor !!!111one!!"<br><br>high forties through low fifty AB should be easy to get just taking the standard route.<br><br>If you want high AC you should just focus on it... the AB will come by itself.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>-Dark<br>_________________<br>They were all dead. The final gunshot was an exclamation mark to everything that had led up to this point. I released my finger from the trigger. And then it was all over. The storm seemed to lose its frenzy.

Well the point on the awesome AB is quite understandable, having an AB of about 70 means you'll be able to hit every single hit (up to 5 APR with Rapid Shot and no haste), contrary to an AB of about 50 where your last APR misses very often, as for offensive vitals, having lots of AA increases both damage and AB to net the damage. That's why Fighter 10 / Wizard 1 / Arcane Archer 29 is such a viable build, it ends with EWS and Enchant Arrow XV, so it's the strongest head on archer on most cases, in my experience with archers, to net the highest damage is the most important, with Called Shot Leg to slow enemies and you won't need AC.<br><br>If you really need defense go with Rogue and Epic Dodge, it also gives Uncanny, you can check my <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "248135", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Artillery Archer</a> for an example, it's not built for high AC, but you'll hardly need it.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/20/07 00:22</span></i></p>

You need Defensive Roll, Improved Evasion, and a Dex of 25 (and I think something like 5 in Tumble). Basically, that means either 13 Rogue levels, 10 SD levels, 10 Rogue levels + 5 SD levels, 9 Monk levels + 5 SD levels, or 9 Monk levels + 10 Rogue levels.<br><br>TM
