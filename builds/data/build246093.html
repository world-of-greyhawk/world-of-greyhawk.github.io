If you haven't seen it yet, this is where the inspiration for this build came from ( <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13422", "245184", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> ).  Thanks Finn, I thought my creative building days were done (I think I've been here for a few years now.. an OLD fart I am <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">      ).<br><br>I did a search and came up with only 3 builds that use this combo, which I found very surprising.  And it was a very nice surprise to be in the company of 3 players whom I have respected for some time (in aplhy order)<br><br>1) Finn's Dex Paladin ( <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "215985", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> )<br><br>2) Ithcan's Avenging Commando ( <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "196784", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> )<br><br>3) Mith's Fearless Cavalier ( <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "198956", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> ).<br><br>I also found my idea totally unique, which was a huge treat.  <br><br>Basically, a semi-discussion began in a post about the rp of a rogue/paladin.  In my view, I found the 2 classes to be extremely easy to rp.  Then Finn put out the dnd class test and I came back with Paladin/thief!  TWICE!   So I put pen to paper (yes I dont use the tools either). <br><br>The first thing I had to look at, if I were a paladin/thief LG, what would I be more of?  It turns out after some soul searching (I was away from my pc for about a week <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">      ) it turns out I am more roguish than paladin, though I do have my moments <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">     <br><br>I chose to use fighter as my 3rd class for the damage bonus and the feats.  I was thinkin of cot, but in the, fighter!   This meant I couldn't have xp penalties!  I HATE xp penalties!  HATE them.   So I was left with this lvl split f6 / p6 / r28 (for the bonus feat). <br><br>The name, despite what I have teased about in other posts as of late, is from the personality test!  Yes, my character is a follower of Tyr <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">       *sigh*  Oh well..  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">        <br><br>The devastating thud comes from the weapon choice : warhammer!!  I went dev crit with this cuz I thought it would be so cool to see a dude get hit with a warhammer so hard that he simply fell over, dead, or better yet, EXPLODE<br><br>The end result was a very surprising winner!  I actually got a semi decent ab (41 with mundane hammer).  With ikd we can get some nice sneak damage (18d6 if I recall correctly).  Then theres always that roll of 1 to get exploded (I hate the 19-20 crit on warhammers lol).<br><br>The lows are the AC!  Even with a high tumble (42ish/ 41 effective) you get only 17 nekid and 28 with mundane gear.  I guess you could use UMD to cast cat's, but I dont count that as a bonus cuz every roguish char should use that, which doesnt make mine special.<br><br>The saves are weaker than Id like, but they can be twinked with cha gear or uni save gear, so not too bad really.<br><br>All points taken, this is really a one trick pony.  Go in, try to KD or sneak the target then hit them hard!  Since I have taken pal with it, NO OL's or disarm traps etc.  thats simply too non-lawful for a paladin!  Of course, what you decide to put on your character sheet is up to you.  <br><br>One last note on the progression, I took rogue in blocks of 4 for the pre lvls.  I did this to ensure that I'd get the full AB of the lvl split.  If I were to play the build, where I personally wouldnt care if I missed one ab or something, I'd take fighter at lv 2 to let me use the hammer earlier.  That's all I really see with this guy.  <br><br>Without further fanfare..  (no story i know..

I'll take a better lookm later, but it seems quite fun for PvM. You only spend 29 ability points at first, put the last in CON, in case you use those potions.

DevCrit factor, indeed; no, don't wanna do that if he's got an extra stat point unspent! Hence, should KEEP STR where it is. Instead, maybe drop 1 cha (only needs 13 for Pally and divine, as I recall) or, alternatively, Int (rogues get so many skills to begin with, that, well, just an alternative option); either way, add this point to Con with that other (unspent) one, for the extra HPs and +1 fort boost, leavin' his Str and dev.crit factor exactly where it is - yes, that makes much, much more sense!

Nice goings avado.<br><br>Odd weapon for a Dev Critter... your weapon's critical threat range is the lowest possible...<br><br>Not bad suggestion to go for more HP TyrTemplar, although 2 Great Constitutions are always better than 2 Epic Toughness (same HP in a level 40 build, +1 Fort save with CON). I'd keep AB as high as possible (and he took Toughness already), this is a guy that uses IKD a lot.<br><br>Not much else to add, great work.

See, in the beginning, it was gonna be a "name" build.  You know, take what the personality test gave and turn it to a build.  The problem was, I like to twink my builds... so in the end, I altered the original idea.  I kept the hammer cuz it makes such a pretty picture in my mind of a huge hammer exploding something in one hit!  No, to answer the critics, I had a wonderful childhood.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/08/06 16:20:00 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I think avado answered your question like no other could... </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->
