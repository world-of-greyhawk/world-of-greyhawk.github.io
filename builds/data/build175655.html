Pretty good build, replacing the Wizard levels (and ability point distribution) with a Wisdom-Based caster like a Druid or Cleric would obviously increase the AC a bit, but I can see how a Wizard might be more fun. <br><br>Good job.

To start with, I've read the various and heated discussions of why adding Shadowdancer to a Wizard is either great or pointless, depending on which side of the fence you fall on.  Personally, I think it is an interesting idea, not because it would be the ideal powergaming build, but because I think it would be fun to play.  This is not directed at the original poster, but is an attempt to discourage the flaming I've seen in similar topics.  Okay, that's out of the way.  <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 01/16/05 11:44:58 (GMT) -- Slimcea<br><br>This is my first build ever, and I'm not sure if this is even the correct forum to post it in, but I would greatly appreciate any improvements/comments/critiques <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Thanks for posting!

(I hadn't decided when to take the second).  All other levels Wizard, of course.<br><br>Feats would be:<br>1:  Dodge<br>3:  Combat Casting<br>6:  Mobility<br><br>(rest of your build snipped)<br><br>I liked the idea of getting HIPS earlier, and of getting some earlier monk bonuses.  However, that does really delay gaining much ability as a Wizard.  I played this to level 5, which gave two levels of Monk and three of Wizard.  It played pretty well, but the lack of focus was hurting it some.  That wouldn't get much better quickly, but getting HIPS would help make up for it.<br><br>One thing I didn't pay any attention to yet was base attack bonus.  Generally, the "rule of four" is advised, but I only have experience in combining classes that use different columns in the attack table.

Then again, with this being a Wizard build you may simply not care.  <br><br>You didn't say where you intended to play this build:  player vs. module, player vs. player, leveling straight to a high level or playing all the way up, etc.  That can make a big diffenrence.  I'm personally planning to do player vs. module all the way from level 1 to 40 (or however high I can get it before being distracted onto something else!)<br>_________________<br>Disarm?

It's definately an interesting build, I've tried something similar though it was 38sorc/1mnk/1sd. Went sorc over wiz for more spells and because I managed to squeeze out the skill points I needed.<br><br> I can see both sides of the arguement but the way I see it, if your fighting a experienced mage the HIPS isn't going to matter much, inwhich case your more or less a pure mage with some nice spell penitration and it comes down to skill and who can last the longest.<br><br>And if you fight a inexperienced mage or a melee, the HIPS makes it all the better <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">
