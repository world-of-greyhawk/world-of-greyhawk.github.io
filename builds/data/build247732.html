This is my first build, so don't hold back on the critique so I can get better at this. All criticism/suggestions/compliments are very welcome.<br><br>This build is intended to utilize the Assassin's DA while giving FEs to further increase damage. Also, the Animal Companion helps as a meat shield to allow for more DAs and to keep tougher enemies at bay/distracted. The SDs HiPS and buffs help maximize the amount of DAs the character can pull off. <br><br>Epic Dodge is taken by level 24 to minimize the amount of hits the character takes. Since HP and saves aren't really that high, the intent is to not get hit in the first place. So, the longbow is used as the weapon of choice to avoid melee encounters. In the event that you find yourself in melee fighting, tumble, PBS, and HiPS will help you get out of there. The main strategy here is hide, DA, rinse, repeat.<br><br>I tested this character, at first against a lvl 40 fighter, then a lvl 40 rogue. Since these were no effore at all, I decided to try something different. Remember that scene in the second Matrix where hundreds of Smiths were fighting Neo? Well, I spawned close to 100 lvl 40 fighters, casted Shadow in the middle of the arena, then hacked away. I stood in the middle of these fighters for close to 30 minutes, and took about 3 shots. As far as I'm concerned, the defense is there. The only problem that I see in this build is the low Will save and the relatively low AB. But, with a good enough weapon and other gear to help with the saves, it is a problem that is easily overcome. Enjoy! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br><br>Thanks to FinneousPJ, Bromium, and Cinnabar Din for their help in pointing me in the right direction, and helping edit the build.<br><br>Moor Stalker (Ranger 6/Assassin 24/SD 10)<br><br>Race: Elf<br>Alignment: Any Evil<br>Playable: 1-40 PvM<br><br>Stats: (Start/End)<br><br>Str 10/10<br>Dex 20/34<br>Con  8/ 8<br>Wis 12/12<br>Int 14/14<br>Cha  8/ 8<br><br>(Increase Dex every 4th level, of course)<br><br>Leveling:<br><br>01: Ranger(1): Weapon Finesse, Favored Enemy: Undeads, {Dual Wield}<br>02: Ranger(2)<br>03: Ranger(3): Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>04: Ranger(4): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br>05: Ranger(5): Favored Enemy: Humans<br>06: Ranger(6): Dodge<br>07: Assassin(1)<br>08: Assassin(2): DEX+1, {Uncanny Dodge I}, (DEX=22)<br>09: Assassin(3): Mobility<br>10: Shadowdancer(1): {Hide in Plain Sight}<br>11: Shadowdancer(2): {Darkvision, Evasion}<br>12: Assassin(4): DEX+1, Point Blank Shot, (DEX=23)<br>13: Assassin(5)<br>14: Assassin(6)<br>15: Assassin(7): Blind Fight<br>16: Shadowdancer(3): DEX+1, (DEX=24)<br>17: Shadowdancer(4)<br>18: Shadowdancer(5): Rapid Shot, {Defensive Roll}<br>19: Shadowdancer(6)<br>20: Shadowdancer(7): DEX+1, {Slippery Mind}, (DEX=25)<br>21: Shadowdancer(8): Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>22: Shadowdancer(9)<br>23: Shadowdancer(10): {Improved Evasion}<br>24: Assassin(8): DEX+1, Epic Dodge, (DEX=26)<br>25: Assassin(9)<br>26: Assassin(10)<br>27: Assassin(11): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=27)<br>28: Assassin(12): DEX+1, (DEX=28)<br>29: Assassin(13)<br>30: Assassin(14): Epic Skill Focus: Move Silently, Great Dexterity II, (DEX=29)<br>31: Assassin(15)<br>32: Assassin(16): DEX+1, (DEX=30)<br>33: Assassin(17): Epic Skill Focus: Hide<br>34: Assassin(18): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=31)<br>35: Assassin(19)<br>36: Assassin(20): DEX+1, Epic Prowess, (DEX=32)<br>37: Assassin(21)<br>38: Assassin(22): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=33)<br>39: Assassin(23): Epic Fortitude<br>40: Assassin(24): DEX+1, (DEX=34)<br><br><br>Skills:<br><br>Disable Trap 34(38)<br>Hide 43(65)<br>Move Silently 43(65)<br>Open Lock 27(39)<br>Search 39(43)<br>Set Trap 11(25)<br>Tumble 40(52)<br>UMD 41(40)<br><br>(Use class skills to properly manage skills.

looks pretty solid.  can't really recommend much, and I like the level spread.  some things to note though.  at l;evel 6 ranger, that meat shield will literally be as good as a shield made out of meat.  you will need to make sure you buff up that animal companion with scrolls and potions to get the maximum staying power out of it.  also, one minor thing, if you are going to have a spell slot for camoflage, then drop 10 points from hide and put it into something like heal or animal empathy.  with some good gloves of an em you can find another meat shield to compliment the first one.  might be of some help in the right environments.<br><br>well done over all, i would say.<br><br>-cs<br>_________________<br>"You cannot pass!"

I don't think the meat shield is really worth it with 6 ranger levels, personally.  I'd drop it to ranger 5 to grab another level of assassin, getting you +1d6 sneak damage and +1 death attack DC.  I also might consider dropping a little dex for some int to help with that DC; the worst thing about DA is that it takes a fort save, which everyone will be pumping to avoid dev crit (if it's allowed) and implosion.<br><br>I like the build, though, cool to see a bowman without AA levels, and bonus points for using assassin.<br><br>*edit* Correction:  The worst thing about DA is that half the time it doesn't work.  The second worst thing about it is that, when it does, it takes a fort save.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Nimueh_Leafbow on 07/24/06 05:54</span></i></p>

Thanks again for everyone's comments. I have made some of the suggested changes, and I will explain them as I go. First, I changed the starting stats by decreasing DEX to 18, and increasing STR to 12 and CON to 10. This gave a +1 bonus to ranged attacks, and increased HPs to 320. I considered increasing INT to 16 instead, but it only increased the DC of DA by 1. I thought the other gains were more valuable to the build.<br><br>Also, I dropped ESF: Hide and Move Silently, and took Great Dex in both of these spots. This brought DEX back up to 34 at the end of the build. Unfortunately, I had to drop taking Epic Dodge until level 27, but I think that was worth it. I also dropped Great Fortitude for Armor Skin. Since I will be using items and equipment to raise my saves, I really don't think this affects my build too severely. One question, though, how high should I aim for my Will and Fort saves in order to make them respectable. I don't want to have to dedicate all of my equipment to bolstering my saves, but if I have to, I suppose I will. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif"> <br><br>Finally, I dropped the 6th Ranger level for the extra Assassin level pre-epic. I figured that I can summon a shadow that will be more powerful anyways, and, if things get really bad, HiPS will help me get out of some tight places. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  Also, traps can be used to gain some distance and slow enemies down if I need them to. Also, I gained an extra +1d6 on DA damage by doing this, as Nimueh_Leafbow pointed out.<br><br>I will post an updated build so it is easier to see the changes. Thanks again for all the comments and suggestions, and more are always welcome! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif"> <br><br><br>Moor Stalker v1.5 (Ranger 5/Assassin 25/SD 10)<br><br>Race: Elf<br>Alignment: Any Evil<br>Playable: 1-40 PvM<br><br>Stats: (Start/End)<br><br>Str 12/12<br>Dex 18/34<br>Con 10/10<br>Wis 12/12<br>Int 14/14<br>Cha  8/ 8<br><br>(Increase Dex every 4th level, of course)<br><br>Leveling:<br><br>01: Ranger(1): Weapon Finesse, Favored Enemy: Undeads, {Dual Wield}<br>02: Ranger(2)<br>03: Ranger(3): Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>04: Ranger(4): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br>05: Ranger(5): Favored Enemy: Humans<br>06: Assassin(1): Dodge<br>07: Assassin(2): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>08: Assassin(3): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>09: Assassin(4): Mobility<br>10: Shadowdancer(1): {Hide in Plain Sight}<br>11: Shadowdancer(2): {Darkvision, Evasion}<br>12: Assassin(5): DEX+1, Point Blank Shot, (DEX=21)<br>13: Assassin(6)<br>14: Assassin(7)<br>15: Assassin(8): Blind Fight<br>16: Shadowdancer(3): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>17: Shadowdancer(4)<br>18: Shadowdancer(5): Rapid Shot, {Defensive Roll}<br>19: Shadowdancer(6)<br>20: Shadowdancer(7): DEX+1, {Slippery Mind}, (DEX=23)<br>21: Shadowdancer(8): Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>22: Shadowdancer(9)<br>23: Shadowdancer(10): {Improved Evasion}<br>24: Assassin(9): DEX+1, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=25)<br>25: Assassin(10)<br>26: Assassin(11)<br>27: Assassin(12): Epic Dodge<br>28: Assassin(13): DEX+1, (DEX=26)<br>29: Assassin(14): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=27)<br>30: Assassin(15): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=28)<br>31: Assassin(16)<br>32: Assassin(17): DEX+1, (DEX=29)<br>33: Assassin(18): Great Dexterity IV, Great Dexterity V, (DEX=31)<br>34: Assassin(19)<br>35: Assassin(20)<br>36: Assassin(21): DEX+1, Epic Prowess, (DEX=32)<br>37: Assassin(22): Great Dexterity VI, (DEX=33)<br>38: Assassin(23)<br>39: Assassin(24): Armor Skin<br>40: Assassin(25): DEX+1, (DEX=34)<br><br><br>Skills:<br><br>Disable Trap 34(38)<br>Hide 43(55)<br>Move Silently 43(55)<br>Open Lock 27(39)<br>Search 39(43)<br>Set Trap 11(25)<br>Tumble 40(52)<br>UMD 41(40)<br><br><br>HP: 320<br>AC: 32 naked/35 mundane armor<br>AB: 39 melee, 42 ranged<br>Saves (F/W/R): 19/16/34<br><br><br>Once I get this build totally ironed out, I will post a v2.0 separately.
