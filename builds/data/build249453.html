I was shocked to see that no one has posted a build like this yet (at least it didnt come up in the search engine), on the server I play on this build is really popular for a bard. The only downside is that he's feat starved in pre-epic feats, it wouldve been nice to get blind fight in,  and improved crit in the pre epic lvls. For his other disadvantages (posted below) most of those can be changed with the right gear. I recommend str and con increasing items, along with a weapon higher then +5. After you have those try to get items that will increase your dex, and wis for better saves.<br><br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: True Neutral<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str: 16<br>Dex: 13<br>Con: 14<br>Wis: 8<br>Int: 14<br>Cha: 11<br><br><br>Leveling<br><br>1 Bard1- Curse Song, Weapon Prof. Martial<br>2 Bard2<br>3 Bard3- Weapon Focus Rapier<br>4 Bard4 <br>5 Bard5<br>6 Bard6- Dodge<br>7 PM1<br>8 PM2<br>9 PM3-Mobility<br>10 PM4<br>11 PM5<br>12 PM6- Spring Attack<br>13 PM7<br>14 PM8<br>15 PM9- Expertise<br>16 PM10<br>17 Bard7<br>18 Bard8-Whirlwind Attack<br>19 WM1<br>20 WM2<br>21 WM3-Epic Weapon Focus<br>22 WM4<br>23 WM5<br>24 Bard9- Improved Critical Rapier<br>25 WM6<br>26 WM7<br>27 Bard10- Epic Prowess<br>28 Bard11<br>29 Bard12<br>30 Bard13-Great Str I<br>31 Bard14<br>32 Bard15<br>33 Bard16- Great Str II<br>34 Bard17<br>35 Bard18<br>36 bard19- Epic Toughness I<br>37 Bard20<br>38 Bard21<br>39 Bard22- Epic Toughness II<br>40 Bard23- Lasting Inspiration<br><br><br>Ending<br><br>Str: 28<br>Dex: 13<br>Con: 14<br>Wis: 8<br>Int: 14<br>Cha: 11<br><br><br>Skills<br>Discipline 43<br>Perform 43<br>Spellcraft 40<br>Intimidate 4<br>Taunt 43<br>Tumble 40<br>UMD 43<br><br>HP<br> 428 fully maxed con its 668<br><br>AC in mundane Chain Armor 34<br>with song: 35<br><br>AB with mundane rapier 37/32/27<br>with song 39/34/29<br>+6 str bonus and +7 rapier with song<br>52/47/42<br><br>Saves<br><br>Fort 21 (with songs 23 )(against spells 29 (with song 31) )<br>Reflex 23 (with song 25)(against spells 31 (with song 33) )<br>Will  26 (with song 29 )(against spells 34 (with song 37) )<br> <br>Advantages<br><br>Immune to crit<br>good AC<br>good criticals and they happen often<br><br><br>Disadvantages<br>Low saves except against spells<br>low ab without anything higher then a +5 weapon, and without +6 str bonus<br>low hp for a melee without con bonuses from items.<br>feat starved in pre epic feats<br><br>comments and suggestions to make the build better are always welcome <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"> <br><br><br><i>Corrected HPs total - Kail Pendragon</i><br>_________________<br>~HGTZOUS<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 08/10/06 14:26</span></i></p>

He has 1 bonus feat total, so he's feat-starved. Not only in Pre-epic. Sure you wouldn't fare way better switching WM for fighter?<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Bard/PM/WM ain't that good a combo IMO, you'll be better off with Bard/RDD/PM instead. <br><br><br>Now, forget PM preepic, it's killing your AB big time and delaying your bardic power.
