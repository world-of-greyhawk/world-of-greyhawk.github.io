A dwarven defender archer has been done before by christian.schnable. His was a combination of  ranger/DD/SD however, while mine is Ranger/DD/Monk. The  main difference between the builds is his is more sneaky with HiPS and damage reduction,  while mine is faster with monk speed  and has a 22 spell ressistance along with improved evasion.<br><br>The link to his build is here.<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "216295", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Defending Archer</a><br><br><br><b> <i> Playable lvl 1-40 can be useful in pvp and pvm, depends what FE's you take </i></b><i> </i><br><br>Race Dwarf<br>Alignment LN<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 16<br>Con 16<br>Wis 14<br>Int 14<br>Cha 6<br><br><br>Leveling<br><br>1 Ranger1- Weapon Focus Longbow, FE<br>2 Monk1<br>3 Ranger 2-Dodge<br>4 Ranger 3 +Dex<br>5 Ranger 4<br>6 Ranger 5 - Point Blank Shot, FE<br>7 Ranger6<br>8 Ranger7 +Dex<br>9 Monk2- Improved Critical<br>10 Monk3<br>11 Ranger8<br>12 Ranger9 - Rapid Shot +Dex<br>13 Ranger10- FE<br>14 Ranger11<br>15 Ranger12-Toughness<br>16 Ranger13 +Dex<br>17 DD1<br>18 DD2- Called Shot<br>19 DD3<br>20 DD4  +Dex<br>21 DD5- Epic Weapon Focus, Longbow<br>22 Monk4<br>23 Monk5<br>24 Monk6- Epic Prowess +Dex<br>25 Monk7<br>26 Monk8<br>27 Monk9- Great Dexterity I<br>28 Ranger14 +Dex<br>29 Ranger15- FE<br>30 Ranger16- Great Dexterity II<br>31 Ranger17<br>32 Ranger18 +Dex<br>33 Ranger19- Great Dexterity III<br>34 Ranger20- FE<br>35 Ranger21<br>36 Ranger22-Bane of Enemies +Dex<br>37 Monk10<br>38 Monk11<br>39 Monk12- Great Dexterity IV<br>40 Ranger23- FE +Dex<br><br><br>Ending<br><br>Str: 10<br>Dex: 30<br>Con: 16<br>Wis: 14<br>Int: 14<br>Cha: 6<br><br><br>Skills<br>Concentration 43<br>Disipline 43<br>Hide 43<br>Move Silently 43<br>Tumble 40<br><br>HP 546<br><br><br>AC 29 normal clothing <br><br><br>AB<br>43/38/33/28<br>Rapid Shot: 41/36/31/26/41<br>~(with +12 Dexterity and +7 bow)~<br>56/51/46/41<br>Rapid Shot 53/48/43/38/53<br><br>+2 vs FEs<br><br>Saves ..start/end<br><br>Fort 28<br>Reflex 27<br>Will 24<br><br>Pros<br><br>Bane of enemies<br>decent ac<br>decent hp<br>6 FE's<br>spell ressistance of 22<br>Monk speed<br><br>Cons<br>Low ab (this can be overcomed with the right gear)<br>Low saves<br><br>Comments and suggestions to make the build better are always welcome <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">   <br><br><br><i>Fixed AB typo - Kail Pendragon</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 08/09/06 10:21</span></i></p>

I would shift 5 monk levels to DD, for 6 points of DR.  Also take your pre-epic monk levels at 12 and 17 for the tumble dumps.  Finally drop concentration for spellcraft, you won't be casting ranger spells in combat (you probably won't be casting ranger spells).<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

I suppose those who want to can change the build around like this though if they prefer DR. <br><br>About the monk lvls pre epic on my first try at this build I did that, yet i believe i lost ab, maybe that was something different and im mistaken.

Its a choice of preferance, whether you want to be a bit more stronger on the defensive side, or the offensive side.<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Now you might think I'm just bugging you, but I'm not quite so. I didn't meant the FE typo, it was corrected by the time I read the Original Post, what I mean is that Rapid Shot gives the extra APR at full AB, you might have not noticed, but that's not fixed, it's counted with -20 as if it were a regular APR, I just thought when I first read it, that you might not know how Rapid Shot works or something... sorry then.<br><br>How stupid of me, you have Improved Evasion already. Anyway, I can understand that Fighter is more offensive and less defensive than Dwarven Defender, because of Defensive Awareness, but please explain because I definitely do not understand: if you cannot use Defensive Stance, then what are the benefits of Dwarven Defender 5 that would best 3d6 sneak attack?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>ok, on the DD5 vrs 3d6 sneak...once again this is my preferance of having a better defense, but i get more hp with 5 dd lvls, and as you said in your post, defensive awareness, also defensive awareness and the extra hp always work, where as sneak only works when your flanking an enemy... If someone likes to have a better offense then they could change it to rogue 5 to get that extra damage without harming the build too much.

Well, there's already an xp-penalty from lvl 4 and out, which can be quite a lot. Adding Rogue to the mix would increase that penalty too, I'd stay with the DD here.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 03/06/06 18:56:45 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br>Trollborn Asgardian by the master of the Norse legends, Grimnir himself!<br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->
