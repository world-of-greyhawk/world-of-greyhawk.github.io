Fighter is not a good choice for a dragon because WS and EWS don't work while shifted, Champion of Torm works a lot better.<br><br>Use the <a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">build searcher</a> and try a few combinations first, over 30 druid levels for any strong casting type, Cleric/Rouge should be pretty easy to find as well.

If memory serves, the earliest possible level you can get Dragon Shape is level 28.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Yeah, 28 is the minimum, AND you need to take CoT for its bonus Great WIS feats, it's the only way to do it.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

It would be impossible to make the searcher with feat sorting, I mean, just check the amount of feats available, or stat posibilities, no can do.<br><br>But if you're looking for a dragon you just try Druid and check them one by one, it ain't hard or anything.<br><br>Your requests are very vague, if you ask for more specific things we might know of a build that fits, but dragon with lots of spells? that doesn't helps, you list you want Druid / Shifter / X, that you can look on your own using the searcher.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

You could just look at the build list and then search for the word Dragon on the page.<br><br>(Firefox use control F)

Yeah!  My build is reasonable!  Er...  *coughs*  I think the build wouldn't work so well as a human, but it might be decent as an elf.  You lose out on some areas and gain in some others.
