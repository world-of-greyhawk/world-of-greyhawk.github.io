Why so many monk levels in Epic? At 6 you  get IKD, at 9 you get Imp. Evasion, but after that you don't gain much (the monk SR is low, less than you would get from the cleric spell, so fairly worthless).<br><br>I would drop at least 2 monk levels for Fighter in Epic, and pick up WS/EWS. That will help your damage output, since the str is so low. I might consider dropping another 2 monk levels for fighter (another bonus feat) or 3 monk levels for Cleric (3 will let you take another Cleric Epic bonus feat). Space out the remaining monk levels for Tumble dumps (end at either 7 monk or 9 monk). So either Cleric 26/Monk 8/Fighter 6, or Cleric 29/Monk 7/Fighter 4.  <br><br>I would also drop Dodge - it's not worth much, and you don't need it as a pre-req for anything. Take Extend spell earlier, and add Empower spell - that one is worth it for the ability buffs alone, and is useful on a number of offensive spells as well.<br><br>Otherwise, nice kama buffer build.<br><br>TM<br><br>P.S. You might want to post the Buffed AB and Damage - Divine Power (+5), Divine Favor (+5), Battletide (+2), Bless (+1), Aid (+1), GMW (+5), Darkfire, etc.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 02/21/06 15:45</span></i></p>

A question, more than a suggestion really. I really don't play clerics much so I'm not sure. But why take animal domain? Won't you benefit more from taking some other domain?<br><br>Chiibo

As a buffing build, the buffs make a HUGE difference in his AB. Someone who's not familiar with cleric builds might take one look at the 37 AB and go "Meh...". But when fully buffed, it will be in the high 50's, even with a mundane weapon (and he will easily reach the +20 cap with magic weapons, so he can pick based on other properties like resistances, elemental damage, etc., while pretty much ignoring the +x enhancement, as long as it's more than 2 or so....).<br><br>TM

"So if I drop dodge and mobility it gives me 2 more feats, that sounds interesting. But why it isn't worth ?"<br>Dodge adds +1 AC against current target/last attacker, not much. Mobility adds +4 AC against AoOs. If you're worried about people getting AoOs when you're casting in battle, ICC, not Mobility, is the solution. If you want the AC, get (Improved) Expertise. IE brings me to the point of 18 starting DEX, which I'd change to 17 and pump up INT to 14 anyway. There's also Toughness to boost your poor HP to consider.<br><br>Polish is cool, I once knew a Polish guy online <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Your sig, Bathory - A Fine Day to Die, eh?

Dodge is just +1 to AC vs. 1 opponent, mobility only helps against AoO's while moving, but with Tumble at 17+, you will avoid them with a tumble check anyway. So Mobilty isn't gaining you anything.<br><br>Neither Mobility nor Tumble help against AoO's due to casting in combat, for that either use Defensive Casting mode or take ICC.
