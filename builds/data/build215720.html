Still spell for easy rebuffing and dispelling in battle.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 10/09/05 20:30</span></i></p>

Looks nice. I would prefer that you post some naked stats, AB, AC and damage, saves, hitpoints, skill allocation and perhaps ending attributes. It makes it way easier for us to see differences in builds. Post the values when you buff to, if you want, and you have already posted with items on your server. You state he is uber in 1 on 1, care to explain why? I don't doubt it, but I'd like to be explained why.<br>seems like a good build, now convince me. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Of course my hard to please friend =P <br><br>Naked Saves: 31/27/26, 26 BAB, 23 NAKED AC, 42 naked ab, <br><br>01: Concentration(4), Discipline(4), Perform(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(8), <br>02: Save(7), <br>03: Save(7), <br>04: Save(7), <br>05: Lore(8), <br>06: Save(5), <br>07: Save(5), <br>08: Save(5), <br>09: Save(5), <br>10: Save(5), <br>11: Save(5), <br>12: Save(5), <br>13: Save(5), <br>14: Save(7), <br>15: Save(7), <br>16: Save(7), <br>17: Save(5), <br>18: Save(5), <br>19: Save(5), <br>20: Save(5), <br>21: Discipline(20), <br>22: Save(6), <br>23: Save(6), <br>24: Save(6), <br>25: Save(6), <br>26: Save(6), <br>27: Save(6), <br>28: Save(6), <br>29: Save(8), <br>30: Save(8), <br>31: Save(8), <br>32: Save(8), <br>33: Save(8), <br>34: Save(8), <br>35: Save(8), <br>36: Save(8), <br>37: Save(8), <br>38: Perform(37), <br>39: Save(8), <br>40: Discipline(19), Listen(43), Lore(13), Perform(2), Taunt(43), Tumble(36), UMD(39), <br><br>I don't max my skillz until I have to because I have to re roll for max hp, so I assure you, skills can wait =P But as a rule of thumb, max said skills whenever you can or can be bothered <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  UMD would be important early on and tumble you can increase every 5 lvls I s'pose but otherwise I CBA.<br><br>It's good in 1v1 cos it has the edge over the opponent when it comes to curse. -5 to ac and -2 to ab. If you're being beaten start up divine wrath for some divinely fuelled ownage. Also you can dispell. UMD allows you to buff yourself. Iron horn if they're dex based, dev crit etc etc ^^

Better. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   The ending skills would have sufficed, though. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    But now we can see. An AB of 42 is quite good, especially when you can self buff. You can probably take on a pure fighter type build. Mix in WM or RDD type fighter, and well, who knows. The CoT gives  your saves a needed boost. Remember for future posts, include your naked stats, and your stats with mundane items, and if you can stats when self buffed. And of course; If you feel like, what you can achieve on your server. A solid, somewhat versatile build.<br>Can you get lasting inspiration on your 19th bard level? I would think not. You need to hold your 10th coT level until 40, and take bard 20 at lvl 39.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 10/08/05 13:48</span></i></p>
