Here is something I have been playing around with.  Needs a good amount of tweeking, so I figured that the fine people here could weigh in and tell what how to improved this build.  My goal was to build a divine sort of spellsword character (yes, they are addictive grizz, but hard to get right...) who makes use of a two-bladed sword, high strength and rogue sneak attacks to finish off opponents.  The clerics use of summons, invisibility spells (darkness and ultravision too, for that matter) and knockdown give a nice trio of techniques for getting those sneaks in...although I wish I could have fitted in IKD.  I also think that I needed to get at least expertise in, but I just couldn't fit it.  Also, this char doesn't get an XP, which is nice.  I dunno, just let me know what you think.  I wanted to preserve HP, and everything else, for that matter.  I think that I spread the stats too thin, but let me know what you think.<br><br><b>PvM, playable 1-40</b><br><br>Human<br>Rogue 15, Cleric 15, CoT 10<br><br>STR 15 to 30<br>DEX 15<br>CON 14<br>INT 10<br>WIS 14 to 17<br>CHA 8<br><br>1 )Rogue1 TWF, Ambi<br>2 )Cleric1<br>3 )Rogue2 Exotic Weap<br>4 )Rogue3<br>5 )Cleric2<br>6 )Cleric3 Extend Spell<br>7 )Cleric4<br>8 )Rogue4<br>9 )Cleric5 Weap Focus: TBS<br>10)Rogue5<br>11)Cleric6<br>12)Rogue6 Knockdown<br>13)CoT1<br>14)CoT2 Improved Critical<br>15)CoT3 Blind Fight<br>16)Cleric7<br>17)CoT4 ITWF<br>18)Rogue7 Toughness<br>19)Cleric8<br>20)Rogue8<br>21)CoT5 Great Strength I<br>22)CoT6 EWF<br>23)CoT7<br>24)CoT8 Epic Prowess, Great Wis I<br>25)Rogue9<br>26)Cleric9<br>27)Cleric10, Great Wis II<br>28)Rogue10 Slippery Mind<br>29)Rogue11<br>30)CoT9 Great Ster II<br>31)Cleric11<br>32)Cleric12<br>33)Rogue12 Great Str III<br>34)Rogue13 Improved Evasion<br>35)Cleric13<br>36)Cleric14 Great Str IV<br>37)CoT10 Great Wis 3<br>38)Rogue14<br>39)Cleric15 Great Str V<br>40)Rogue15<br><br>As for skills, dump point into Concentration and Spellcraft at cleric levels, Discipline at CoT levels and Tumble, UMD, Search, and whatever else you wish (disable trap isn't bad) at Rogue levels.

Wouldn't it be nice to have cleric level 8 spells? (ooh, battletide!) I'd I'd give up 2 great str feats for one more great wis and a feat of your choice. Perhaps just one str for one wis on a low or mid-magic world where you don't reach the +12 limit anyway.

Very Nice!  I like it quite a bit; especially the fact that it is a strength build that gets 16 BAB, all the dual-wield feats, plus Darkfire and Sneak attacks.<br><br>Anything that isn't immune to sneak attacks will be slaughtered when you use the Ultravision/Darkness combo, especially with Darkfire, Divine favor adding to the damage.<br><br>The only thing that might cause you some occasional problems is the low caster level vs. Dispel.  If you run into mobs that spam dispel's you could see your buffs quickly disappear.  I wouldn't change your build for it, though, I just thought I'd mention it.<br><br>Again, very nice build.

Nice build.  I don't see a way to squeeze in IKD without giving up dualwielding altogether and putting some of those Dex points into Int.  The advantage in doing this would be more skill points (approx 80), 1.5 strength bonus if you go 2-handed weapon, or sword and board for shield bonus, and a +2increase to your AB.  More efficient, perhaps, but loses out in the concept category.<br><br>As for Epic, I, too, would consider dropping two great strengths for 1 Great Wisdom and Armor Skin.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I think that I agree with pulse and grizz.  the extra level of cleric spells would be nice.  and switching out the dual wielding for more skills points and a sword and board or dual-hander is probably a smart idea...i just think the TBS is a neat weapon...i should probably try it with a fighter build though.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br>thanks, dmuzzy, for the warning.  i knew the buffs would be easy to dispel, but a crowd would be very bad.  this is where some other spells would need to be used i think. extended darkness (perhaps several) and ultravision should reduce crowd problems.  but a problem to be aware for sure.   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif"> <br><br>well, with those ideas in mind, the re-structure on the build, both in concept and in play is obvious...any others that i can implement would be of value.  thanks to the above mentioned for their input.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-C<br>_________________<br>Do not meddle in the affairs of Dragons, for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.
