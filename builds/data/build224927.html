I prefer to use it as a tank, using knockdown and then it’s sneak attacks to dish out damage comparable to Rogue attacking a flat footed opponent in melee. This build’s strength also lies in it’s versatility, as it can fight crit and sneak immune foes without worry, because of it’s large STR bonus.<br><br>Advantages:<br><br>High damage output against any type of enemy<br>High AB means IKD will succeed often<br>IKD means every hit has a +4 to attack and +7d6 sneak attack damage<br>High HPs means that he can tank and dish out damage. Very useful in any environment.<br>HUGE crits. A sneak crit can do easily over 200 damage with a mundane weapon.<br><br>Disadvantages:<br><br>Low AC. This means he will get hit often, although his large amount of HPs means that he won’t need to worry about this too much, as I he can just take the hits and strike back with his huge crits.<br>Low skill points. His low INT and core classes means there are very few skill points to spare. This is a problem in social skill servers, but who needs to talk nice when you can kill everyone? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">     <br>No damage reduction. I know it’s a major flaw. But it has nice enough HPs as it is and therefore should still have surviveability.<br><br>FAQ:<br><br><b>Why 8 WM?</b><br>The 8th level of WM can be used anywhere, it just gets no feats or extra skills, so I opted for another Ki Damage<br><br><b>What is the advantage of this build over WM heavy builds?</b><br>This build has versatility. While WM only builds may struggle against enemies that are the same setup, because of their crits and so on, this buld plows through them with it’s IKD-sneak tactic, and leaves other weapon master’s eating it’s evil dust<br><br><b> What would be this character’s role in a party?</b><br>There is no “set” role for this character. He can adapt from a damage taking tank to a supporting role as a flank attacker. He can also hold off multiple enemies without worry whilst other party members heal and rapidly and strategically withdraw.<br><br><b>what kind of world suits this character?</b><br>Any. That’s the simple answer. There are so many different jobs this character can do, it can function in almost any environment. In a Low-magic world, its fiendish servant comes into play, and also he can self buff with bull’s strength, meaning that he has high survivability.<br><br>Any and all feedback is always welcome.

Very nice. You get a BG who truly can fight. Epic prowess is a BG bonus feat, but you haven't taken it. Trade Epic toughness for epic prowess. Don't take 8WM, yes none of the other classes get anything for the extra lvl either, but switching it for fighter or BG, will give you their feats 1 level earlier. If you want you can take that 8th lvl in the end anyhow.<br><br>As for KD, the scythe counts as a large weapon, giving your opponents +4 DC to resist it, right? <br>A crit/sneak with this char is probably a sight to behold. If IWWA is possible to get to, try it. It would reduce weaker mobs to dust in one attack.<br><br>Also worth noting, if you can boost your CHA, do it, your saves are LOW!

Nice build. Drop lore and pump SC to 19 for a +4 to saves vs spells. Your saves really suck and you are gonna need that more than lore.

Pretty interesting fighter-blackguard type build.  Should make quite a nice "reaper" for cannonfodder type enemies and anything that doesn't have spells or spell-like attacks.<br><br>Your defenses are relatively weak, especially your saves.  You're really going to need to carry clarity potions.  You will want to take epic prowess, and you might want to change epic toughness 1 to epic skill focus (discipline) because you'll be easy to hit with penalized attacks like knockdowns, called shots, and disarms.<br><br>I understand why you take O Crit considering you're a WM and you've got a weapon with a big crit modifier.  When you crit something, ouch!<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Not wanting to nag, dude, but wouldn't expertise be of need here? As far as I know, expertise is a pre-requisite for taking whirlwind attack, and thus for weapon master, and you apparently missed it. Otherwise a great build, but you'll need to rearrange your level progression pre-epic I'm afraid.

And a sneaker will have trouble unless he has HiPS, since a sneaker build can have a little troule KD'ing him. He doesn't say it's unbeatable. It isn't. But I'm sure it can hold a presence. Especially in group PvP. A slugger with sneak capabilities and good crits will be noticed. He has quite nice AB to, you know.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 12/30/05 16:04</span></i></p>

Don't you think it'd be kind of unfair for the mages? And for a balanced server (PvP or not) there should be no Immunity items or items that give class-specific abilities at all (boots of stealth with HiPS, yay). In my opinion, of course.<br><br>So, to answer your question briefly: a balanced server.

And besides perhaps save or/and some stat boosts... Who knows. CON boost, CHA boost and a small save boost and he can easily be up at least 5-10 points+. That's a beauty of Blackie's. You know guys, planning.

im going to try a DD version.<br><br>the starting stats are already very nice<br><br>16 STR<br>13 DEX<br>18 CON<br>8  WIS<br>13 INT<br>8  CHA<br><br>with his high HP and DR he will be able to tank better than the BG version but he sacrifices the sneak attacks which is a big con.  but on the server i play on (3towns), 600hp, low ac, no DR just dont cut it.
