I've been through the listed Epic Builds, and looked at virtually all of the WM Builds. Now, they're all so good I'm left with a perdicament, LOL, which one do I choose!<br>   Before I list the ones I think stood out, I should set the scene as to what I'm wanting from the WM. Firstly, the character will be purely to gain the highest AB, not worried about SR or fighting Mages, it's simply a melee monster I'm after. The action server I play on has a lot of magic items, and with all the builds I would probably choose a Rapier as the Weapon of Choice (I'm sure choosing a different Wep of Choice wouldn't cause any problems?). Okay, here are the Builds I thought stood out:<br>-Master of Melee PVP V2:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "139688", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>-The Ravaging Conquerer:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "125719", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>-The Enforcer:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "118914", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>-Gnarlic the Brute:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "137020", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Again, thank you very much for any help, and thanks to all of the builders, they are all great, but I can unfortunately only make one at the minute, LOL! Thanks again!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Denigrade on 11/18/04 00:42</span></i></p>

How about my <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "160882", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Arcane Knight</a>? He has everything a warrior should have, including high AC and AB, and also have access to powerful spells and has the biggest critical chance possible - with Devastating Critical.
