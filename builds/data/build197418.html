<b>Straight level 40  .. PvM Build</b><br><br>The Untouchable (29 Rogue/1 Sorcerer/10 Red Dragon Disciple)<br>by Cakerj<br><br>The initial idea for this build was: 50% concealment (not just for some time, like monk`s Empty Body, but always) plus Devastating Critical. And I achieve this objective. But, in the end, it wasn`t as good as I expected. Reason: low saves (except for reflex) and low AB. But I decided to post it anyways, so you can see it for yourself.

All I can remember now it that you need 8 lore by level 7 and 20 (if I am not wrong) in hide and move silently by level 23.<br>* These are rogue extra feats<br><br>FINAL STATS (naked) :<br>AC : 32<br>HP : 252(no rerols)<br>fort: 20<br>reflex: 30<br>will: 20<br>AB (mundane rapier): +32/+27/+22  1-6+8 (critical: 15-20/x2)<br><br>PROS:<br>- nice naked AC<br>- self-concealment V<br>- improved evasion<br>- epic dodge (it comes as a free feat, I just don’t remember at what level)<br>- access to use magic device<br>- with hide and move silently maximized and Epic Skill Focus in both of them, you`re undetectable.<br>- a 15d6 sneak attack (since you`re hardly detected when in stealth this is a useful attack).<br>- devastating critical of 12-20 (with keen)<br>- immune to sleep, paralysis and fire<br><br>CONS:<br>- medrioce HP<br>- very low AB and damage<br>- low saves (except for reflex)<br><br>Off course, with access to buffs and all items of the game (use magic device), these stats can get higher, but since I haven’t tried, I`m still pretty unsure of this build. It has a good concept and, in fact, it`s very hard to hit, but the way it is it would be better to use monk`s empty body.<br><br>If you guys have any idea on how to improve this build (especially on the 3 cons) speak out.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 06/09/05 18:01</span></i></p>

Firstly you need defensive roll for epic dodge. Secondly you never get it for free. That being said swap out the epic skill focus for defensive roll and epic dodge and the build is sorted.<br><br>Nice idea. <br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

If you could squeeze in Weapon Finesse that would give you a couple more AB; rumour has it, and I have never tried that you don't actually need weapon focus for Overwhelming and Dev Crit, so that may be a way to go.

Well, without checking how it would turn out, you could try to take only 8 rogue levs pre-epic, and then use two bard or sorc levs to minimize BAB loss. Or take 12 lev rogue pre-epic, this will kep BAB loss to a minimum. Also, switch those feats mentioned above, and switch imp evasion for EWF, it should be possible, since you can use the rogue levs taken epic to gain great dex. But you have to do some revising. Nice char, though.

Remember, you don't need Dodge to get Epic Dodge.  Nor do you need it for SC.  It's not a requirement for anything this character does.  It only gives you 1AC vs 1 opponent.  Nice, but not as useful as Knockdown.  With Knockdown, you use it when you are performing a sneak attack, catch them flatfooted, which means they will not get their Dex bonuses.  Spam them with Knockdown in your initial Sneak Salvo, get them prone, and then they suffer even more sneaks with your +4 to hit.<br><br>It works.<br><br>And by taking Weapon Finesse, I believe you raise you AB by +2 since your final Dex is 30 and your Str is 26.<br>_________________<br>Homer: Lisa, would you like a donut? <br>Lisa: No thanks.

Epic dodge has a bug in that it does not require the feat dodge nor does it require the tumble ranks listed. It only requires 1 rank.<br><br>Bioware have stated that they are leaving it as is because it "will break too many builds".

What do you think of switching 1 initial point of STR to 2 points on CON to raise that very low hit points? IT will have the 25 STR needed for Devastating Critical and, since the AB will be based on DEX (from Weapon Finesse), the only con will be 1 less damage per hit. So what do you think: 1 more damage or 40 more hit points?

I didn't look at it in detail, but it appears that you can't pull devastating crit off in time.  Regardless, I would argue in favor of leaving your strength the way it is.  You have Epic Dodge, SC V , 14d6sneak (going by a 2Bard variant), UMD, a decent AB with some Dex enhancers.  You can be a real pain in someone's life.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Isn't that funny, Steve?  How, at the end of the day, it still boils down to Math?
