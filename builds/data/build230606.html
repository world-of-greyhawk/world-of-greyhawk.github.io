Nimble Dragon Druid30/Monk9/Rogue1<br><br>Yes, yet another dragon build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   I've played this char<br>in PW and very good from 1~40.

Dodge and mobility don't give you +5 AC. Dodge gives +1 AC vs your current target or last attacker only and Mobility +4 AC vs AoO only. <br><br>Your naked AB is 49 not 49. In DS you've got +6 claws and -2 AB due to size. Don't trust the sheet.<br><br>Your naked AC is 62 (63 vs current target/last attacker), you're not considering -2 AC due to size.<br><br>Buffed AB (capping STR in DS at 60, easy to do for a druid with AoV, empowered bull's strength and bloodfrenzy)) should therefore be 55.<br><br>Buffed AC (Barkskin, capped WIS from Owl's Insight and +2 DEX from AoV) should therefore be 75 (76 vs last attacker/current target).<br><br>I would go human, get Disarm/ID and expertise/IE dropping dodge and mobility. I would start with 14 INT, 10 DEX and 12 CON, the rest staying the same, pump WIS only and drop SP to get another Great WIS to end on 34 WIS for +1 AC. Otherwise get SF feats and SP and end on WIS 32. Empower spell is taken way late in the build, I'd grab it sooner. I would move Monk 5th and 6th lvl on 21st-22nd character lvl to get AC bonus, speed bonus and KD/IKD immediately in epic.<br><br>UMD and spellcraft use modified ranks in multiples of 5, you should get 42 and 39 base ranks only. If you go for 14 INT then spellcraft should be set to 43. Human with 14 INT would allow you to max out hide/MS too.<br><br>You could also drop 2 lvl of druid, keep SP and go for 3 lvls of rogue for uncanny dodge. You would have only a 5% chance of not penetrating 32 SR. I'd begin with one lvl rogue in early epic lvl for UMD without hurting BAB, then spread out the other two lvls. I know, that means xp penalty but could be well worth it.<br><br>By avoiding to put one stat bump into dex you could grab DS at 32nd lvl with the 24th lvl druid bonus feat.<br><br><br>I guess that's all, it's a solid dragon, the cheesey lvl of rogue for UMD is nice. 3 for uncanny dodge would be better though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Wait for me Dragon, we'll meet in the sky<br>By fire and magic, I'm sworn<br>Hell is calling, we cannot be denied<br>Fly to the blackness of the Storm<br><br>We must die to be reborn!

Ah, thanks for the advice. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Forgot not to trust that damn stat sheet. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_redface.gif"> <br><br>Uncanny dodge, that's very tempting. I'll have to see what I can do. Since, I want to keep 9 monk levels for Improved Evasion. I'll have to go druid28/monk9/rogue3 and probably use human.<br><br>Chiibo

I trust what you say and all Kail but this phrase just sounds weird:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Your naked AB is 49 not 49.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->
