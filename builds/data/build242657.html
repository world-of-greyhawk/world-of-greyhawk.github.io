The Dragon Slayer:<br>continuing the bardic and ye ole' Briton theme . . . (and a really decent story to come, I do promise <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>Got this idea, for a pally/rdd mix that I build quite some time ago, from old Celt, Gaul, and Norse legends of medieval times. The tale is of knights being infected by dragon's blood, of half-human/half-dragon beings once believed to walk the Ires and swim/hunt the Scottish lochs. A part of the Beowulf tales, and Arthurian legends, too. Even Shakespeare, Yeats and others wrote about these things; hey, but no pressure on me in terms of the story <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>Before I post such story, though, thought I'd see what folks here in the community thought about this one (now, don't be afraid to comment <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br>In the build search, while Pal/sorc/rdd has been covered it seems, this class combo and character still remains fairly open. (To be honest, didn't really look at those others, only to see how often the subject matter has been covered; however, I happily point out that our very own Finn suggested the combo to another player/builder a while ago it seems, and that player didn't follow through. So, Finn drew one up, using the Gnome <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    . . . <br>I'll include the build links when I post the story; in the meantime, I'm a bit iffy when playing with a Pally, in public, due to the alignment issue (some folks are sensitive on that).

Nifty. While I never post builds that require an alignment shift, I've always loved the idea of a Pally/Bard combo. This has only one alignment shift, so I think that's pretty slick and more than acceptable.<br><br>At first glance, the only things I can see are:<br><br>Take only 40 ranks in Tumble, as the AC boost works off base ranks, not modified, so your 8 DEX is not going to affect that.<br><br>Take your Perform to 43. With your Bard Song active, that will push your Perform skill to 55, which gives you a full level 21 Curse Song.<br><br>I'd also start with 16 STR and 14 CHA, and put 4 boosts into CHA. That way you get your AB and damage boosts a bit earlier. Take a good look at where you get your next levle of Bard spells and where you need your CHA to hit 15 and 16 to utilize them and plan your boosts accordingly.<br><br>I'd even be tempted to take only 30 STR ad put 4 more into CHA. This will give you more mileage out for your Divine feats as well as a bit more Perform skill and some bonus spells. (You could adjust your Perform ranks a couple points lower accordinlgly if you do this).<br><br>I'd also dump Lingering Song and pick up one of: Blind Fight, Cleave, Knockdown, or Toughness.<br><br>Lastly, I don't think you've chosen any feats that require 13+ INT, so I'd start with 12 INT and 12 WIS. With a +2 WIS item, that will give you access to your bonus level 2 Pally spells for Bull's, Eagle's, or Aura of Glory (the latter two - especially Aura, which stacks with Eagle's, IIRC - would be very useful for Divine Might and Divine Shield).<br><br>Nifty build though, I quite like it.

Hey, Cinn: good to see ya! Thanks for the kind words on the build. I'm glad you like it! Your words of encouragement re: alignment are also appreciated; yes, I was a little iffy on that, but figured that here I'd be in good company <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      I also appreciate your review.  <br><br>Your comments on divine are well taken, and I can see where that would come in handy. I'll look into that and some of those other great suggestions of yours regarding feats/spells (yeah, I hears ya: once he/she's got the last.imp, given the class combo, that feat slot taken for lingering may indeed be better spent on something else . . . Ah, so many feats to consider, so few slots . . . LOL). Nice call - thanks!<br><br>As to INT, no probs re: feats, but a problem with the skills in terms of their number - he/she doesn't get a lot, which is kinda frustrating, and reason for the INT stat; gets boosted eventually by RDD, which is great, but not in time for catching up per se. <br><br>I suppose I could take some points from concentration or perhaps UMD, since spellcraft's high . . . <br><br><br>hmmm, more pally spells would def. be good, and esp. when they stack for Divine (sounds pretty darn good!)  Great comments!  <br><br>While this build has def. been fun and has some really neat benefits, he/she is an older character from my Pre-Guild Days <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">      ------&gt; (loose translation: could use some of that magical "fresh eyes"  polish.

Nicely done.  Needs a bit of polish here and there, I echo Grim and Cin, drop the int to 12 and raise wis to 12 also start with a 16 strength and 14 charisma so you get that AB boost at the start.  I'll also add drop lingering song and take still spell if you want to cast in battle.  Actually feats like still spell, knockdown and blind-fight might warrant dropping a couple of great attribute feats to take them in epic levels.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Dittos on changing your starting stats.<br><br>You should also just finish RDD as soon as possible.  Don't put it off till the end of the build, there's no benefit in doing so and getting to RDD 10 earlier will make you a lot more powerful as you level up.  <br><br>The only reason I can see in your build is that you wanted to have bard 21 land on level 39 for lasting inspiration... but I have looked in the Feat.2da file and the prereq for lasting inspiration is Bard Song level 20 - so you should be able to take lasting insp on the 20th bard level, the 21st level and "epic bard" feat qualification isn't necessary for it.<br><br>Change improved critical to blindfight.  Improved crit is nice, but blindfight is necessary.<br><br>Consider changing lingering song to knockdown, still spell (not really that vital actually), or to put improved critical back.  You're getting lasting inspiration (eventually), which makes it redundant (though it will convenient to have lingering for most of your character's career, you can really use the free feat, too).<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

If he gets all the RDD lvls early on as suggested (and as I would do too) then yeah, good catch. Otherwise keep RDD 10 at 40th lvl and take 10 Paladin lvls straight out at start up.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

Wow. All this great brainstorming - wonderful!<br><br>The Grimmer is right; as much as I would love to get pally level 2 spells in there (I know which ones you're thinking, and what a great thought); but not possible without another alignment change. Unfortunately, can't do that: wouldn't go over well and while it's rather easy to go from lawful to neutral (just act chaotic, get there in no time), the same isn't true the other way around. Once bitten by a drake, well, get wild of course, turning into a half-drake yourself (but great thoughts...again, I know the ones, yeppers, ...<br><br>But that's OK - if we change his starting stats, boost wis 1, we get one more level 1 spell, ie., prayer, which boosts his AB another +1 -- not bad for a level 1 spell! And that's a great call.<br><br>So much wonderful thinking and tweaking I tells ya; just so much fun <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Then, if we keep it levelled as is, run pally up 10, then bard, then rdd, and find or buy a nice +2 wis boost . . . that could work well too. <br><br>Let me cash it out and see what this looks like; good reasons def. for both - esp. since we're not then hampered by last.imp (cool!). <br><br>Keep those great thoughts coming!

Alright, just checked it out - unfortunately, as great a thought it was, re: pally level 2 spells, we'd seem to lose a level of RDD, unless we did the align.change on level 40; unfortunately, there's no way around it. But that's okay, we've plenty of bard and gonna get a second level 1 pally spell. And, best yet, with that great tip re: LI, we're gonna bring on those wings even sooner! <br><br>Let the drakening begin LOL<br><br>Tyr<br><br>Seriously, thanks guys: all this great polish and ideas, feeling even more inspired re: the accompanying story (you know you earned it! - another fine team effort) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

LOL<br><br>Hi, Av: in my life outside the realm, my readers tell me they'd enjoy my works even more if they were (are we all sitting down for this) ... LONGER .... tee hee (so, mind if I quote you on that?!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>Totally Off-Topic: Your note about men and women is very astute; back in pre-historic days, most men congregated on the hunt i.e. mammoths, whereas most women congregated back in the cave/early village, and began the farming life, at that time it's believed in social groups. That's not to say that women didn't hunt in prehistoric times ('cause many did), or that men weren't back at the cave planting things/helping out ('cause many did that, too); however, male hunt and female farm was the basic rule. <br><br>My work brings me into contact with some psych types, and many have postulated that, since hunters didn't need as elaborate communication skills as compared to ie. social group farming, .... (negligible though; modern brain is pretty much the same, thus I think it's more about individual personality, but the ancient brain is still there . . . These are just theories. No cave men or cave women around to chat with of course <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">       Cool point though, and very astute. (And I'm so quoting you!) <br><br>ON Topic: As to passing some of that dragon blood out, would be my pleasure. With all the great comments I've received on this character --all of it valid and good (and much appreciated <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">       -- we're quickening the drakening. In turn, will have lots of drake blood to hand out . . .<br><br>Off Topic: I have so much fun doing this, and really glad to see that it comes across - that's what hobbies are all about, and I know that lots of you guys/gals here are having a great time, too - I see it in many of your builds, everyone having fun, and that's terrific!).<br><br>On Topic: So, stay tuned for the updated version and of course the accompanying story (it'll be a short one, but promise to make it enjoyable) Really, thanks everyone <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Robert Tyr on 06/04/06 19:11</span></i></p>

Um ... we know you meant to write Pally and not FTR, didn't we?! - darn those typos!... - (cute, Grimm! Oh, if only . . .  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>Chose Pally over Ftr for many reasons. least of all the Pally/RDD/Bard combo remains pretty much wide open - being but a very small handful, and nothing close. Also, this is an updated version of an older build of mine, and when I imagined a dragon slayer, both back then and still now, Pally naturally cames to mind. I think of the Pally as a Noble and a Knight, one that is courageous and kind. And thus most fitting to be the "dragon slayer" (and, in turn, placing him/her at the most risk to become a half-drake).<br><br>Ah, but another image, perhaps, is in order, oui? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    <br><br><a href="http://www.saberfire.com/dragons/archivelow/140.jpg" target="_blank">Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Robert Tyr on 06/06/06 03:59</span></i></p>
