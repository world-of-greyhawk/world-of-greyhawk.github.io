Wow, I say, as much rogue levels as many builds thri-classed. 9th level spells. This guy can take on most opponents. With spell mantle's, Mord's etc he can take on even mage's perhaps. His ranged attacks with sneak will not get through Epic warding? He does both mage and rogue things well, and you are good at utilizing the Harper I must say. Looks like two tons of fun to play, not bad for 50 lbs of creature. He will probably be hard to level early on, tho.<br>I really like this little fella. Sorry i can't tweak him for you, though.<br>Nice, nice, nice. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

I like this build, another for the Halfling of Doooooom vault <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   It's pretty obvious by now I'm a fan of harper scout and killer halflings, so this build is like a yummy piece of pie for me.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>You might want to consider focusing on ranged weapons and using summons for tanks.  This will give you the ability to get ranged sneak attacks 100% of the time and provide a good counter to the build's low HPs, and save you a few dual wielding feats.  <br><br>Epic dodge and improved invisibility will help defend you from archers, and spell mantles from other casters.  I bet this would make an excellent party support character as well as a reasonable soloist.<br><br>One last thing... you could ameliorate your hp situation a bit at the cost of dex, by using Gnome.  No xp penalty as gnome's favored class is wizard.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Thanks for the kudos guys.<br><br>Grim: I figure he'll still be okay to play at low levels. First 4 levels are just straight Rogue anyway. Then, once he gets 4 or 5 of those WIZ levels under his belt and combined with traps, that should make him able to handle most situations.<br><br>Xylo: I'm reworking it for a Halfling slinger build (not a heck of a lot to change other than a few pre-epic feats). Ends up with a +1 AB due to God Aim. A Gnome version sounds intriguing too. I'll see if I can work one up.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

What's interesting is how unassuming the build looks.  Some Harper Scout, a few Wizard levels, some petty Rogue levels....but what you end up with is an Epic Dodging dualwielding Halfling who can buff like it's going out of style, pull 8th and 9th level spells out of his butt, lay every kind of Deadly Trap, and then walk home and have his afternoon tea and crumpets with all his Harper cronies.<br><br>This is the kind of character that my old DM would make as an NPC, and we'd go beat this little snot up, and from nowhere he commences to opening up a can of whoop-arse on us.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Sigh... this reminds me that we (Cin, myself and a host of others) all have quite a few builds that will be rendered illegal due to when Epic Dodge is acquired.  I believe they are enforcing Tumble 30 score now, which means 27th level is the earliest a dexer can grab it.
