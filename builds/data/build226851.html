This build is yes another dragon build but I couldnt resist this one since its a role playing build. I'm unsure if something has been posted similar to this so my apologies if its crossing somebody elses. <br><br>The build concentrates on all the aspects of nature, so I thought adding the shadowdancer level would be interesting. Being able to move between the shadows of the forest during day and night is the focus of this build.

You may want to try a lvl by lvl format, makes the build more readable. What's your preepic lvl split? Naked stats? (AB, AC, saves in human form, unbuffed)<br><br>Now, about the build: power attack and great cleave? and no extend spell nor empower? Two epic feat slots to get preepic feats? All the spell penetration feats with 32 caster lvls? Seems like you can quite improve the build by making a better feat selection.<br><br>I'd drop power attack, great cleave, SP and GSP to get IC, extend spell, empower spell (or maximise) and another feat (blind fighting, or heavy armor or zen archery), then epic you can get EP, take more Great WIS early on to qualify earlier for dragon shape.<br><br>Also, go monk 6 (monk 4 preepic not to hurt AB) and SD 2, so as to get uncanny dodge (wholeness of body is the only thing monk 7 gives you). <br><br>A minor change is to take 40 ranks in tumble instead of 42. Those two extra points give you nothing.<br><br>Please, post a lvl by lvl format, we can give you better advice if the build is more readable.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 01/12/06 22:37</span></i></p>

Ok, so what about something like this?<br>You don't really need SP since you are gonna penentrate anyhow the default maximum SR and monks focusing on SR are unbeatable even with all SP feats and pure caster. Extend and empower (or maximise) spell make you a more versatile and survivable caster. Spreading around the monk lvls gives you Wis bonus to AC from the start and regular tumble (therefore AC) bumps. 4 monks preepic only to increase AB. SD on 20th lvl did hurt AB unnnecessary (if you want early HiPS take SD at 8th lvl at the cost of 1 AB, otherwise leave it at 21st lvl). SD 2 gives you uncanny dodge, which is a precious addition.<br><b>Dragon shape now is available at 33rd lvl</b> instead of 40th. <br>I left CC/ICC even though you could do without (but I agree they are useful feats) but there was room to fit them in. I feel the build is a little feat starved preepic. Blind fight is a must to me and I find expertise/IE very useful in a caster build. Not to say zen archery in a WIS build is veeery helpful. I would probably even drop toughness for one of these feats.<br>I would start with 18 WIS and 12 DEX or STR (choose yours), the other at 10. Or start 17 WIS, 11 STR, 14 DEX instead of ICC take Great WIS to keep DS at the same lvl take ICC after DS on a druid bonus feat and drop one GrWIS for something else (ER should be the only possibility though)<br><br>AB: 26/27 depending on starting STR (38 ranged if zen archery is taken)<br>AC (naked): 33/34 (depends on starting dex)<br>Saves (fort/ref/will): 24/19 or 20/36 (+9 vs spells)<br><br><br><br>1.

Thanks for the post. Interesting idea I will look into that. I fogot to mention that when I was talking about a DC of 26 the build was buffed with owls insight.<br><br>DC = 10 + 16 + Spell LvL

Uh, sure. I am accustomed to read naked stats like most people here. Just a little advice, when writing buffed stats, indicate that. Something like:<br> AB(<i>buffed</i>): 65<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail
