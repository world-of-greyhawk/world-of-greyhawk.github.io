First of all, I substracted the penalty for using rapid shot. I just have written it Fast Shot by mistake. When the build says to take Fast Shot, take Rapid Shot instead (not to mention that there is no such feat as fast shot in NWN).<br><br>As I said, most of the spheres suit this character, so he's still pretty good even with the spheres I chose for him - although he'd be slightly better with improved invisilibity, I must admit. <br><br>AC 52 is high for an archer - it's his AC while wearing a full plate enchanted with Magical Vestment (+4). His attack bonus is low for an archer, but high for an ordinary character - most of the archers have huge AB and terrible AC, the concept of this character is to create a more balanced AA.<br><br>For me, lowering his cha and putting the points to wis is not worth it - but if you think different, go ahead, this won't affect the character's integrity.<br><br>---------------------------------<br><br>I've forgot to put the list of buffs and spells he uses - here are my suggestions.

Please explain why you chose to increase Cha over Wis...<br>IMHO, Wis is better suited for this build, as it would increase AB, as well as boosting cleric spells.<br>Cha may boost bard spells, but you have only 3 levels of bard...besides, using Full Plate increases spell failure for bard spells.

Divine might only affects damage, not AB.  Also, it's your charisma modifier that determines how many times a day you can turn undead (and, by extension, use divine shield/might), not wisdom modifier.<br>_________________<br>"Intelligence is knowing a tomato is a fruit; Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad."

This character can turn undead (and therefore use divine might or divine shield) 11 times a day. Both divine things last for 9 or 10 rounds, and without them his AC and dmg is smaller by 9 (minimal buffs) or 10 (maximal buffs). So, they last for more then enough to kill a small group of strong enemies (tested), and when they run out yopu can always turn them on again.<br><br>This can make someone confused:<br>Minimal buffs - minimal rolls in all buffs that give randomised bonuses (Aid gives 1 HP, Owl's Wisdom 2 wis etc).<br>Maximal buffs - maximal rolls in all buffs that give randomised bonuses (aid gives 8 HP, Owl's Wisdom 5 wis etc).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tengudor_t on 08/27/04 09:17</span></i></p>

The stats are great for when you activate might and shield, but I know from experience of playing a character based around those two feats, when you don't have them, you are in a world of hurt usually. That's why I usggested a couple points get swapped between Wis and Cha.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>
