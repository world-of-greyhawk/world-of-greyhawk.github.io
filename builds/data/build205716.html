In the time of the Great Expasnsion, during the years of the Empire's Conquest of the Mountain Tribes, there was one who rose among that fierce folk to lead his people against the "civilized" soldiers of the Empire.   Fell and filled with wrath, he became a Chieftain among the tribes, and grew into a symbol of defiance of the Empire's conquest.  And everywhere he went, always there was a great Raven who flew above him.  And it was said among the tribes that the Raven was a god of Old, and that he protected the Chieftain from death, for the great bird could see it from aloft.  <br><br>Suffering one embarrassing defeat after another, the Emperor became mad with a desire to find this Barbarian Lord of the mountains who made a mockery of the greatest Army in Faerun.  He eluded capture, won victory after victory, and soon grew into a legend among the Northern peoples.  <br><br>But he fought one battle too many.<br><br>He eventually was captured.  But rather than kill him outright, they wanted to break the spirit of the Tribes by making an example of their greatest warrior, their greatest symbol.  He was beaten, tortured, and crucified upon a hilltop sacred to the Mountain Folk.  Daily, vultures picked at his still living flesh.  But a Raven came among them, and said, "Take of this his flesh, his arm, but I ask you to leave his heart, for he will need it that he may have revenge." And so he endured the elements, and starvation, and dehydration, and at the end of each day the Emperor would come to his shattered and gangrenous form and would ask him to surrender, and each time the barbarian would lift his head up slightly and spit frothy blood in defiance.  <br><br>But a day came when he no longer lifted his head.  And it was in this hour that the Empire's legions had found a way to conquer the Mountain peoples, and subjugate them to their rule.  And the once-proud Chieftain was cut down from the crucifix and cast into a shallow grave,  forgotten, and left to rot.<br><br>I know this because I was there, that day.  It was I, a simple gravedigger, who dug his grave, I who was commanded by the watch commander to cut him down, and I who cast his body into the earth.  And after the soldiers left I remained, for I was weary from my labours, and so I sat upon a small outcrop of rock that slowly sank into shadow beneath the mountains of the setting sun.  I looked on the meager grave, without stone or tribal totem, and I pitied this once great man so filled with life.  And as twilight creeped over the land, I saw a strange thing happen.  I saw a bird, a great thing of ebon, circle above the grave, and then land without a sound upon it.  It began to busy itself with pecking and scratching the earth.  I picked up a rock to cast at it, for I felt this noble man at least deserved some dignity in his death, but something stayed my hand.  For in that instant it perceived me, and I it, and I knew this was no ordinary carrion, but that raven I had heard mentioned in the mountain tales.  And as I watched, enthralled by this strange creature, a sleep stole over me.<br><br>The hoarse sound of cawing and the morning sun awoke me, and it occurred to me that I had fallen asleep and had dreamt it all.  I looked to the source of the cawing, and there upon the grave were hundreds of ravens, all black as night and blanketing the earth with their feathered forms.  And then, almost as if they preceived me, they flew aloft, like some dark stygian cloud, and flew beyond the mountains until they were out of sight.  I scrambled to the grave sight, and there I found the most peculiar thing of all.  The dirt and rocks had been moved, and there was naught but an empty hole. Naught but a single black feather, as long as my forearm and just as broad.  <br><br>And it was in the coming years that a new force moved among the mountain peoples, and a Raven was ever seen flying above the visage of a new, mysterious leader, shrouded in cloaks, and whose left arm and hand was bundled in a black cloth.  <br><br>And it seemed that the mountains themselves spewed the hordes of barbarians who came thundering across the plains, who set siege to the capitol, and threw down its gates, and set the city and its people ablaze, such was their wrath. <br><br><b> For PvM, playable from 1-40</b><br><br><b>The Revenant</b><br><br><b>Barbarian19/Wizard5/Palemaster16</b><br><br><br><b>Benefits:</b><br>Greater Rage: +6 Strength/+6 Constitution/+3 Will Saves<br>Immune to Sneak Attacks and Criticals<br>Excellent Hit Points for a Spellsword<br>Tremendous Melee Advantage with Stilled/Extended Buff Spells<br>Great Skill Set (including Taunt, Spellcraft, Hide, Move Silently)<br>Terrifying Rage with an unmodified DC of 52<br>High AC<br>Improved Invis 9x/day (4 Stilled)<br>DR 3/- and Fire Resistance 10/-<br><br><b>Weaknesses</b><br>Low Will/Reflex Saves: remember, Clarity is your friend.

Scribe Scroll is a Wizard ability gained at 1st level Wiz, and often overlooked by players not as versed in NWN or DnD lore.  In fact, Palemaster aside, just pure Wizards scribe scrolls a lot.  Back in the day, when a wizard leveled up, he got to pick one spell, from level, and that was it.  But he still had the ability to "burn" a scroll to his hard disk, so to speak.  That was really how Wizards filled up their spellbooks.  If you sat around and waited to level up, your spellbook would be virtually empty.<br><br>So back to the Palemaster, after Wizard level 4 in this build, one obtains spells for their repetoire by scribing them to their spell repetoire.  The scroll is used up in the process, and then that spell is permanently yours.  Scrolls are pretty common drops, and fairly easy to obtain in most environments, so it shouldn't be a problem, unless you are playing in a no-magic world(in which case, Wizards and Palemasters wouldnt even be a class.  It would just be Fighters, Barbarians and Weaponmasters).<br><br>Thanks, Christian, for highlighting that, as there's probably quite a few who were not aware of it.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Awesome Griz.

This would make them last longer (although you would spend chunks of gold on it; it's worth it to extend eg flameblade from 5 minutes [1d4+5] to 15 minutes [1d4+10]; as with greater magic weapon [goes to +5 off scroll]).<br><br>It might also be worth your while to consider an extra int point.

I suppose if you restructure the build, you could go with 14Barb in pre-epic, 4Wiz and 2PM, and then take only 2 more Barb in Epic(one to get TR and the other to skilldump your Intimidate and Taunt).  Doing so will allow you to take 3 more Wizard levels.  This would give him then 2 8th lvl casting slots, and GS, IIRC, is Vocal only.

Cool story <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   , reminds me a bit of the Crow, in terms of visual imagery, but it comes out less goth (unless you are talking about the Germanic barbarian tribe) in the D&amp;D setting.  I like the build (Spellswords are my favorite characters) but I would drop a wizard level for a Barbarian level.  Terrifying Rage only affects creatures that have up to twice your Barbarian hitdice, IIRC, so that would let you terrorize level 40s.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 07/28/05 08:35</span></i></p>

I thought the same thing after I had written it, although intitally there was no bird imagery, but rather it was wolves.  On a tangent note, I always liked the idea of Barbarians choosing Totems, in a way like clerics choose domains, and then have the Barbars acquire modest little buff powers from that totem.  <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;I like the build (Spellswords are my favorite characters) but I would drop a wizard level for a Barbarian level.  Terrifying Rage only affects creatures that have up to twice your Barbarian hitdice, IIRC, so that would let you terrorize level 40s.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->  It's funny you should mention that, for two reasons:  A. it initially was a 20/4/16, but Cin and I both agreed that what was gained by 19/5/16 was greater than what was lost.  And B., someone just recently had shown a script on the general forum that suggested that Ter-Rage used Class hitdice and <b>not</b>Barb hitdice.  Like you, I always thought it to be Barb hitdice, for in playtesting I never discovered anything to suggest it were otherwise.  If it were true, then all someone really would ever need to take is 15 Barb levels and you can Terror the world.  I would be interested to know what is the actual case here.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
