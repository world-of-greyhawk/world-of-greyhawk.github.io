Thanks to Herbie Shimmer, Evo Dragon, and Emrill for their help and suggestions.<br><br>“With a motion, the Lich sent his minions around her to prevent her escape. She smiled, bemused. There was something dazzling about her, the way she moved when not moving, the way clothes moved around her blending with the shadows, her dark skin the shadow of her cold white mane. Her beauty weaved in the swathes of shadow, cloth, and desire almost as if she was just a mirage brought on by his troubled mind, his haunted past. Her elvish eyes burned with life – even from afar, he was drawn to her, her life force tantalizing him. His bone jaw almost curled into a smile as he thought of what could have been, being with her when he was counted among the living. . ."<br><br>“In an instant, she moved among his undead warriors like a ghost wisping through a haunted room. Each swing she dodged effortlessly – her form everywhere her body wasn’t. After each had swung their weapons a few times and missed, she paused looking at them and smile across her pristine face. If they had breath, they would have gasped. A clear song, like a dirge one plays before love-making, began to echo across the chamber as her sword slithered from its sheaths. Then she was moving again, faster this time, swinging her sword as if she were making love to the shadows. Each swing cleaved a minion – one blow was all she needed, the steel a brief flicker among the carnage."<br><br>“Arcane words intoned forth from the Lich, but each spell she dodged lithely jumping a stream of eldritch energy from one side to another. Before he sensed her, she was near him, looking up into his darkness. She smiled, and brought her face close to his as if they were going to embrace – steel flashed in the lich’s periphery as he felt the blade singe through his exposed rib cage. His soul was suddenly ripped down by an inextricable tug. He was able to hold himself there for one more moment. . ."<br><br>"He looked into her smiling face as she laid two fingers across the exposed bone of his skeleton face, she was so close he almost thought he could smell her. As the invisible hand of the underworld tensed around his ankle, his soul burned hot – whether from anguish or desire he could not tell – and plummeted to the darkness below. His last memory after a thousand years was the soft humming of her song, gleeful and just, running across his skull down into the ear toward the hollow that was his heart, heavy, moist like dirt across the top of a grave. . . “<br><br>This build was intended to do two things: 1) use SD at epic levels, something not done often; 2) have Dev Crit + Epic Dodge + Self-Concealment V.<br><br>Elf / Neutral Good<br><br>Str 16, ends 26<br>Dex 19, ends 30<br>Con 8, ends 10<br>Wis 8<br>Int 10, ends 12<br>Cha 11, ends 13<br><br>Adds.

Pretty cool build -- with one major problem.  I believe Epic Dodge has Defensive Roll as a prereq.  Defensive Roll is a Rogue feat, but you have no rogue levels.  And both Epic Dodge and Self Conceal both require Improved Evasion -- also not something your build has taken into account.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Shadowdancer class gets all the prerequisites for epic dodge on its own<br><br>Defensive Roll at level 5 , improved Evasion at level 10.<br><br>And yes you need improved evasion for tumble.<br><br>Only classes that can qualify for epic dodge are as follows<br><br>Improved Evasion<br>Monk level 9<br>Shadowdancer level 10<br>Rogue level 10/13/16/19 bonus feat or epic feat<br><br>Defensive Roll<br>Shadowdancer Level 5<br>Rogue level 10/13/16/19 bonus feat or epic feat<br><br>So pure rogue, pure shadowdancer, rogue/shadowdancer and monk/rogue , monk/shadowdancer could all qualify if they have the right levels.<br><br>I love this build, I would never play it myself because (IMO) of the ridiculous wings.<br><br>Oh and btw concealment never stacks Im afraid.

I tried something very similar and I can tell you the problem with this build - lousy AB. Possibly you could get away with this on a no or very low magic world. Otherwise you'll only hit on a 20 and never crit.

AB of +33 isn't what I would consider low. It is fairly on par with most other characters out there. The bigger factor is only 3 main hand attacks a round instead of 4 for a melee based design. He'll have two issues. One is his STR isn't maxed so the dev crit save isn't very high., and two he isn't in the 4 attack per round range. He makes up for some by being hard as hell to hit.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

An AB of 33 is not on a par with most other builds, presuming we exclude Wiz and Sorc builds. Most other builds will at least have 4 pre-20 levels in a class with full BAB, dex builds will have WFinesse, and most builds will have EWF and EProwess.<br><br>I reckon that most builds relying on physical attacks for damage have an AB of around 40 with a non-magic weapon. Plenty of builds will get considerably more.<br><br>So, is it worth getting such a low chance to hit, just to get the odd successful dev crit (with the low AB and poor DC the chances of hit, successful crit and failed save must be pretty low against most builds)?

My take on this build is that it is more of a 'project build' rather than a true playing build. No criticism intended, but that's my take on it. I think it's pretty cool and good engineering that put dev crit and SC 5 in the same build.<br><br>I tried this build in a fast-level PW and found I had a hard time hitting critters at level 40 and didn't get too many Dev Crit blows.<br><br>Kaliban.

The build I tried was Bard2/RDD10/Rogue28. Similar in many ways, although I think it's a little more efficient (being as you're not really making use of the Bard levels). Same problem though, I couldn't hit enough. And crit didn't happen when I needed it.<br>_________________<br>My other char's a Bard.

It seems we don't disagree on the facts - just the interpretation. I would see 38 as the minimum - do nothing special and you get this. So the average must be higher, but let's assume it's 38 dead for now.<br><br>Whether 38 vs 33 is a big difference depends on a lot of things, but if we presume two similar chars, let's say two versions of this build, one of which has AB33 and the other has AB38, both have an buffed AC of 40, then the AB38 build hits 25% more than the AB33 build (and will have 4 attacks vs 3). 4 hits at 45%/20%/5%/5% vs 3 at 20%/5%/5% is a significant difference. And the difference holds true for quite a wide range of ACs - for lower ACs the difference is even more significant.

Very true. This build could squeek a few more AB out of it, but at the cost of either SC feats or feats for whirlwind (which is what I would drop personally). End result is a slightly stronger build at the cost of a gimick attack that won't be used very often.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Since, despite the manual's description, weapon focus is not required for dev crit (I think it is listed as a prereq for improved crit...not true), I suggest dropping weapon focus rapier for weapon finesse.  You lose one AB from the feat, but gain 2+ from your base dex + any items/cat's grace spells.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.rpgmods.net/forgottenworlds/phpBB2/" target="_blank">Click Here</a>
