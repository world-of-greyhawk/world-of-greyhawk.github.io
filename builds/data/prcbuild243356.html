Therefore, boosted DEX is for AB and TWF feats ONLY! If you are not interested in TWF, stick with INT boosts, jack up initial str and you become a high damage machine! But Insightful Strike ONLY works with Light or no Armor on...so might as well go high DEX &amp; Weapon Finesse.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By MorteMeister on 06/09/06 07:59</span></i></p>
