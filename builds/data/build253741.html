Another PM 10 build. And a "Halfling of Doom" one too, all rolled together in one cute little package <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br>We've got an Epic Dodger, Self Concealment V halfling dexer here, with a wide skill selection (Rogue+Bard); actually it's so wide that skillpoints ain't enough (not that they ever are enough to me). Spellcraft and Taunt are a nice addition that will help vs spellcasters (better saves and spell failure chance) and melee types alike (lowering their AC). A 6th lvl Bard Song is there to help a little too. <br><br>Considered the high AC, ED, SC V, Crit immunity, IE and high Ref save you are going to be quite hard to damage. Damage output is excellent when sneaks fire and can be made decent thanks to UMD vs crit/sneak immunes. Crippling Strike is in to make this little fella an even nastier Doom machine. <br><br>KD/IKD are missing. IC is missing too, but that’s no big deal at all IMO with a sneaker with this amount of sneak attacks. EP and AS are missing. This little guy’s tight on feats. HPs are low: one could lower STR to 8 and pump CON to 14 if the loss of carrying capacity ain't gonna be  an issue. Leveling up, as all dexers, is gonna be harder than with a STR build but not incredibly so.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "223311", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Little Deathless Sniper /Rogue 24/Bard 6/Palemaster 10</a> by Jennalee goes with the same lvl split but does't aim for SC V and her halfling's a sniper (dards are the chosen weapon), doesn't get CS, does not dual wield and has a lower AB.<br><br><br>******************************<br><br><br><i><b>Pale Sneaker of Doom - Rogue(24), Bard(6), Pale Master(10)</b></i><br>Halfling, any non lawful, non good<br><i>PvM, Playable 1- 40</i><br><br><br><b>ABILITIES (ending)</b><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 20 (32)<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br><br><b>STATS SUMMARY</b><br>Hitpoints: 338<br>Skillpoints: 346<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 18/19/36<br>Saving Throw boni: Spells: +9, Traps: +5, Fear: +2, Improved Evasion<br>BAB: 25<br>AB: 40 (melee), 38 (dual wielding), 38 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/naked and medium shield): 36/38<br>Sneak attack: 12d6<br><br><br><b>SKILLS</b><br>Disable Trap 1(5)<br>Hide 43(54)<br>Listen 43(44)<br>Move Silently 43(56)<br>Open Lock 1(12)<br>Perform 13(12)<br>Search 1(3)<br>Set Trap 34(45)<br>Spellcraft 43(45)<br>Taunt 43(42)<br>Tumble 40(51)<br>UMD 41(40)<br>no points leftover<br><br><br><b>LEVELING GUIDE</b><br>01: Rogue(1): Ambidexterity<br>02: Rogue(2): {Evasion}<br>03: Rogue(3): Weapon Finesse, {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>04: Rogue(4): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br>05: Rogue(5)<br>06: Rogue(6): Two-Weapon Fighting<br>07: Bard(1)<br>08: Rogue(7): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>09: Rogue(8): Weapon Focus<br>10: Rogue(9)<br>11: Rogue(10): Crippling Strike<br>12: Bard(2): DEX+1, Blind Fight, (DEX=23)<br>13: Rogue(11)<br>14: Rogue(12)<br>15: Rogue(13): Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Evasion<br>16: Bard(3): DEX+1, (DEX=24)<br>17: Bard(4)<br>18: Rogue(14): Toughness<br>19: Rogue(15)<br>20: Rogue(16): DEX+1, Defensive Roll, (DEX=25)<br>21: Pale Master(1): Epic Weapon Focus<br>22: Rogue(17)<br>23: Pale Master(2)<br>24: Pale Master(3): DEX+1, Epic Dodge, {Darkvision}, (DEX=26)<br>25: Pale Master(4)<br>26: Pale Master(5)<br>27: Rogue(18): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=27)<br>28: Pale Master(6): DEX+1, (DEX=28)<br>29: Pale Master(7)<br>30: Pale Master(8): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=29)<br>31: Pale Master(9)<br>32: Pale Master(10): DEX+1, (DEX=30)<br>33: Rogue(19): Self Concealment I, Self Concealment II<br>34: Rogue(20)<br>35: Rogue(21)<br>36: Rogue(22): DEX+1, Self Concealment III, (DEX=31)<br>37: Rogue(23)<br>38: Bard(5)<br>39: Rogue(24): Self Concealment IV, Self Concealment V<br>40: Bard(6): DEX+1, (DEX=32)<br><br><br>******************************<br><br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><b>•</b> Acceptable melee AB<br><b>•</b> Excellent AC<br><b>•</b> Crit immunity<br><b>•</b> Immunity to Paralysis, Stun and Hold<br><b>•</b> ED<br><b>•</b> SC V<br><b>•</b> Crippling Strike<br><b>•</b> Improved Evasion<br><b>•</b> 12d6 sneak attacks<br><b>•</b> UMD<br><b>•</b> Taunt<br><b>•</b> 6th lvl Bard Song<br><b>•</b> Wide skill selection<br><b>•</b> Halfling of Doom!<br><br><br><i>Weaknesses</i><br><b>•</b> Only acceptable AB<br><b>•</b> No KD/IKD<br><b>•</b> Low HPs<br><b>•</b> Low Will and Fort saves, Spellcraft helps vs spells<br><b>•</b> Tight on skillpoints<br><b>•</b> Tight on feats<br><b>•</b> No Bard spells<br><br><br>******************************<br><br><br>Feedback and constructive criticism are, as usual, gladly appreciated.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Unto to the darkness<br>I commend my soul<br>Never shall I repent<br>Never shall I be saved<br><br>I'll go into the House of Death<br>Before my last breath<br>My enemies all shall die!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 09/25/06 17:36</span></i></p>

Very nice little killer you got there Kail. I have a simular one, but he is RDD10 instead of PM10.

Certainly looks good to me.  My only critique would be to question the lack of KD.  I understand that you're feat-starved, and that the feat is less effective on halflings than others, but still...without KD or HiPS, how are you planning on generating sneaks?  Just rely on always having a party to let you get in flanking attacks?  Despite the HP issue, I might drop Toughness for KD, unless you really are positive you're always going to have someone else to take attacks so you can get your sneaks in.

Summoned creatures help. Usually such scrolls or potions are easily available. There are also other spells that can help generating sneaks, but it depends whether they are available or not.

I wouldn't be concerned about Hit points.  The only thing that can kill him are failed saves on Instant-Death spells and IGMS.  With Epic Dodge, SC V, Crit/Sneak Immunity, and a nearly 40 AC without magic items, it's not like he's going to die as a result of combat.

Sweet build, but you could drop the two-weap tree for a +2 to ab and the chance to get KD and IKD. Also you could use a large shield, doesn't have as massive a skill penalty as a tower shield and its only 1 less ac then the tower.

The damage output is higher dual wielding than single wielding, always (vs all ACs) and it grants more sneak attacks which means a faster death for your opponents.
