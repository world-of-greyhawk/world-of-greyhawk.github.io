Yeah, AC is good though, 46 with Improved Expertise, suppose he only adds Natural, Deflection, Dodge and Armor ACs, not shiel in most cases, with +5 and haste that would give him a 70, a little more from DEX-boosting items (as I'm counting the +5 dodge from Boots of the sun soul +5), so, as long as he's not on a low magical server he should hold up very well.<br><br>EDIT: sorry, HP added.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 04/22/06 18:03</span></i></p>

Epic dodge is only effective against one attacker at a time, and even with imp expertise you lose all your tumble, haste, and you can still be deved. A rogue 8/bard 4/ 28 pm would give you better flat ac, or maybe try a wisdom monk/wiz/pm for better defense and healing abilites, with a bit of speed, and if you go with flurry + dual kamas you get so many attacks that you have about 1/2 a chance a round of getting a hit if you need it.

Nope, it's just awfully hard for the sr to help if you are getting smashed with multiple crits, dev and kd which is the basic intent of the character. And as I said in the last post the extra healing power from higher wis will let you heal a good 33 extra hp per round. Just an alternative suggestion that trades one potential weakness for another, every build has it's flaws.<br><br>Maybe another good build to try would be a high hp cleric/bard/pm. Nothing outheals a cleric, and the concentration skill could be sky high.

Multiple crits, dev and what? He's got a naked AC of 36, which is darn good. He states clearly it's a build that is to be used for PvM, and so I seriously think spamming KD's until they roll a 20 would be a rare occasion. Also, Epic dodge doesn't work quite like it should, if someone other than your main enemy hits you in the same flurry you Epic-Dodge, their first hit will be dodged too. Noone is quite sure how it works, but it's better than descripted. I am pretty sure most opponents would need 20 to hit this fella, TWICE a round. His SR won't totally protect him from dedicated casters, but again, this is a PvM build.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

Flat footed ac is 27, uncanny dodge only keeps dex ac, all the rest of the dodge goes right out the window, except +4 on attacks of opportunity with the mobility feat. Maybe epic dodge works different against npcs. I've had a few of them and I'm pretty certain from my experience that it is only good against one at a time in pvp, but for some reason pvm seems to be different. As for how hard he is to hit, well that depends entirely on the mod, doesn't it? Not the most experienced PvM'er here, so I respect your opinion that it is enough ac for the majority of mods/pw's out there.<br><br>A small but potentially useful change to the posted build would be to take ranger instead of fighter for traps (drop concentration) and purge scrolls if they are available. Might need to lose armour skin or a spell resist feat.<br><br>You're also missing 1 bab, if you take all your class levels in groups of 4 pre-epic you can always get that 15 pre-epic bab, which simply requires you to waith until level 21+ to take the fith sd level.<br><br>Also, I suggest dropping lightning reflexes for disarm. Why? Well, you are a dex based monk with high sr, so you probably won't miss it much, but more to the point: a regular disarm attempt invokes an attack of opportunity on the attacker. So if one of your mates get into trouble because of an ambush or whatever, it can be quite useful to at least blunt some of the attack for them, if not force the npc to focus all attention on you.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By D O'Brien123 on 04/23/06 14:35</span></i></p>

Losing AC being flanked is bad, but not much to do, I would need another 5 levels of Dwarven Defender to be immune to flanking, but I already lost enough SR.<br><br>If you take the SR away then what's the point? I would be making another AC tanker, I wanted him to cover from spells too, that's why his party should work ranged, or area spells would hit them anyway. Aside from that, I already made another tanker, to kill melees: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "238107", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Arcane Wall V2</a><br>(yes, I'm trying to "promote" my own builds).<br><br>Forget AB, if I wanted AB, I would at least have taken Weapon Finesse, I mean, he doesn't hits nor deals damage, I know that. Disarm is actually a very good defensive ability since I would decrease the damage they make greatly, however, "you probably won't miss it much"? I would encourage you to read the AB: +24, that is a crappy AB that only hits on rolls of 20.

When I said you probably wont miss it much I was talking about the extra reflex from the lighning reflexes feat. Attacks of opportunity are not made as free attacks iirc and are always triggered whether the attempt works or even if you miss. So seeing as you are an unarmed monk I still think disarm can help more than the +2 to reflexes. Why would lightning reflexes be needed though?
