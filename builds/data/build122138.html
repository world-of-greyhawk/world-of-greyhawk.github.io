OK Gruuk Poisonbleeder is checked, adn I found him to be the coolest assasin of all times.<br><br>Reasons:<br>Ab: due to ftr and barb lvls in the beginning he can hit anything<br>Ac: due to the tumbling skills of the assasin, and the fact that he wears heavy armor and a shield, gives him very good ac<br>He also gets 7d6 death attack from the assasin lvls, and<br>funniest of all he can sneak most things due to his improved invisibility<br>Rage: numerous times per day giving yet better ab and dmg<br>Feats: ahh nwm ill post my view of him now<br>Weapon: warhammer for sweet crit, or scimitar for increased chance of crit<br><br>Race half orc, al Chaotic evil<br>Str 20<br>dex 12<br>Con 14<br>wis 8<br>int 10<br>cha 6<br><br>barb 21, ftr 6, assassin 13 (also thought barb20, ftr5, as 15 would be fun for 8d6 sneak)<br><br>increase str at every lvl<br>I want to take thundering rage and overwhelming crit as well as epic WS, part from that i chose epic WS, epic prowess, and armor skin.<br>INcrease str at every opportunity, and you should at least end up with a str of 32.<br><br>Now if someone a bit better than me at builds could optimise this even more I would be happy<br><br>Thnx and good night<br><br>Edited By bnarve on 04/07/04 16:01:16
