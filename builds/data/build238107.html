... It's a little annoying not to get any replies, and it has more than 40 views already...<br><br>Hmmmm.... maybe he needed a story......<br><br>I actually started to use it, he's good in PvM, and I'm still not in epic levels, using Premonitions for DR. I'm also using Extended Death Armor, only 1d6+5 magical damage, bit it's still more, and magical is a great type of damage.<br><br>One of the things I'd like someone to clarify me is if Perfect Health is really worth it, I mean, there wasn't much to choose, I saw it and couldn't resist it, but I don't know how good it is.

Perfect health is no big deal IMO, Epic Toughness or Epic Energy Resistance (fire or acid) would be a better choice.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

Epic Energy Resistance sounds better, +20 HP doesn't sounds so great to my 704, I suppose fire is the most common.... thanks.<br><br>Oh great, I just realized I could take EDR much earlier, I only need to manage 1 bonus feat at Dwarven defender 14 for that...
