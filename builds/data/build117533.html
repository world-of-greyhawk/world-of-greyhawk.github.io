Been using this build on a pvp server, serves great against archers, sneak attackers, dev/crit based builds.

I doubt if the original builder still looks at these boards to answer the question. It was posted a year ago. You never know though<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

The best shifter build is a Rakashaka based shifter. 29 druid/10 shifter/ 1 monk. With over 80 AC you can pummel things with 66 cold damage + 18 bludgening damage. Now let's say someone has cold immunity or can actually hit you then that's why the little feat called dragon shape comes in handy. In that shape you have over 90 AC and you don't kill them by attacking. You kill them with dragon breath. With a haste robe you can dmg them for 50-60 breath damage about 3 times a round and it's over 100 damage if they fail their reflex save. The only thing you won't be able to kill is a pure monk since his SR will be too high and improved evasion negates dragon's breathe but he won't be able to kill you. You won't be able to kill everyone but no one will be able to kill you.<br><br>But there's always those nasty 20's people roll to dev crit you but hey 1 loss out of 20 isn't too bad.

I must agree with the above.. versatility is nice.. handy.. cool.. you can do that funny dance as a kobold and such.. but Rakshasa, undead lord and dragon are about the only three shapes that I find worthwhile to be perfectly honest &gt;_&lt;<br><br>-DaMouse

Dont forget the epic Kobold as well.  HiPS, improved evasion and 5D6 sneak is quite nice for someone with no rogue levels.

Well to get epic kobold shape I believe that you need 17 lvls of shifter and that severly lowers the power of this build. IMHO all shapes besides rakashaka and dragon are useless. Sure there are shapes that give huge defensive capabilities but their offensive powers are for crap. Risen Lord for example is good for a beating pole but let's think for one second. Sneak attacks aren't going to happen when you have true seeing and critical hits and damage immunity doesn't matter when people can't hit you.<br><br>Now take in mind I'm a pure pvp player so I go for the most effective builds with the least amount of weakness so I don't have RP in mind.<br><br>Another thing is that Rakashaka shape gives a bonus to Hide/ms so it would also be fun to make a druid/shifter/sd and sneak/pp sneakers themselves.

Undead lords dmg redux sucks compared to dragons doesn't it? I'm just saying that undead lord can work well if combined with WM or something to boost it's damage output. But yeah.. two main ones.. Rakshasa and Dragon for sure.. 6 monk is a useful tool for KDing people as a big fat ugly dragon too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-DaMouse
