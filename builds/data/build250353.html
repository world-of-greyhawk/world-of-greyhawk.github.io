Sneaking, Trapping, Slashing and Casting Illusions PvM (1-40) and PvP<br><br>The Leprechaun (Fighting Spirit of Ireland)<br>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar<br><br>Concept: The Leprechaun; a Celtic Faerie of Irish lore, known as the leith brog (or, leith brogan and, in some places, pronounced Luchryman), which means, the shoemaker. Believed to be a wealthy and master craftsman, with a crock of gold, the Leprechaun is an unsociable and solitary faerie. Many believe they are good-natured and intelligent, with a sharp wit; while unsociable, the Leprechaun is nevertheless capable of highly stimulating and most interesting conversations, whenever the mood to engage in such discussion should strike. Similar faeries are the Cluricaun, and Far Darrig which are believed to be either relatives of the Leprechaun, or the Leprechaun itself when in a different mood or shape (but which all Leprechauns deny).  <br><br>While the Leprechaun is believed to be good-natured overall, a practical joker with the power of magic (illusion) and stealth, the Cluricaun and Far Darrig are most mischievous spirits; according to O’Kearney, in the Feis Tigh Chonain: (the Cluricaun and Far Darrig) “dress with unfairy homeliness, and are the most (loose), slouching, jeering, and mischievous phantoms.” Whereas the Cluricaun is a known nuisance and sometimes dangerous faery, making himself drunk in gentlemen’s cellars, the Far Darrig (or, Red Man, so-called due to his/her fondness for wearing a red cloak) busies itself with grotesque jokes, and nothing more: in fact, s/he delights in playing gruesome games against humans, his/her favorite prank being to invite a human over for dinner, for the purpose of causing its guest to faint in horror by serving up an old woman’s corpse, which corpse Far Darrig either magically creates or fetches from a local grave, in accordance with a cruel sense of humor. Whether these spirit folk be one and the same faerie, such as a Leprechaun on a spree, or be they three entirely different albeit related spirits, nary an Irish writer agrees. As to what these fae spirits look like, different accounts exist depending as to where in Ireland you are, but similar attributes are shared, in that they all be practical jokers of small stature, with a preference also for the color red. <br><br>Character: in keeping within the spirit of true Irish lore (and differing from the 3 other characters in the pulse cap that use the same class combo but different levels) the Leprechaun, is a magical, stealth-character, being balanced between rogue and wizard, in order to achieve good, buffable AB with decent buffable damage, stealth (skills and HiPs), and a rather nice assortment of skills (incl. UMD). With ample access to wizard spells (including 9th level), and although vulnerable to dispelling, Leprechaun can buff all stats, saving throws, AC, and AB/damage. S/he also has Time Stop which, among other things, enables some rather exciting damage. Without further adieu, please meet Leprechaun, a fighting fae-phantom with stealth and illusion, being the pride, fun and spirit of Ireland.<br><br><br>The Leprechaun (Fighting Spirit of Ireland) -- Overview<br>Wizard (18), Rogue (17), Shadowdancer (5)<br>Race: Halfling: (Fearless, Good Aim, Lucky, Skill Affinity: Listen, Move Silently; Small Stature)<br>Alignment: Leprechaun (Chaotic Good); Cluricaun (Chaotic Neutral); Far Darrig (Chaotic Evil)<br><br>Final Stats:<br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 20 (34)<br>CON: 10<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 15 (19)<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Level Guide:<br>01: Rogue(1): dodge<br>02: Illusionist(1): {Scribe Scroll}<br>03: Rogue(2): weapon finesse, {Evasion}<br>04: Rogue(3): DEX+1, {Uncanny Dodge I}, (DEX=21)<br>05: Rogue(4)<br>06: Rogue(5): extend spell<br>07: Rogue(6)<br>08: Rogue(7): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>09: Rogue(8): weapon focus: shortsword<br>10: Rogue(9)<br>11: Rogue(10): improved evasion<br>12: Illusionist(2): DEX+1, mobility, (DEX=23)<br>13: Shadowdancer(1): {Hide in Plain Sight}<br>14: Rogue(11)<br>15: Rogue(12): knockdown<br>16: Shadowdancer(2): DEX+1, {Darkvision}, (DEX=24)<br>17: Shadowdancer(3)<br>18: Illusionist(3): empower spell –OR- improved knockdown<br>19: Shadowdancer(4)<br>20: Illusionist(4): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br>21: Illusionist(5): great dexterity I, great intelligence I, (DEX=26), (INT=16)<br>22: Shadowdancer(5): {Defensive Roll}<br>23: Illusionist(6)<br>24: Rogue(13): DEX+1, great dexterity II, epic dodge, (DEX=28)<br>25: Illusionist(7)<br>26: Illusionist(8)<br>27: Illusionist(9): epic weapon focus: shortsword<br>28: Illusionist(10): DEX+1, great intelligence II, (DEX=29), (INT=17)<br>29: Rogue(14)<br>30: Rogue(15): epic prowess<br>31: Rogue(16): improved sneak attack I –OR- crippling strike<br>32: Illusionist(11): DEX+1, (DEX=30)<br>33: Illusionist(12): great dexterity III, (DEX=31)<br>34: Illusionist(13)<br>35: Illusionist(14)<br>36: Illusionist(15): DEX+1, great intelligence III, great intelligence IV, (DEX=32), (INT=19)<br>37: Illusionist(16)<br>38: Illusionist(17)<br>39: Illusionist(18): great dexterity IV, (DEX=33)<br>40: Rogue(17): DEX+1, (DEX=34)<br><br>*Magic School : Illusion chosen for theme reasons; for the Far Darrig, Necromancy would be his/her school, but feel free of course to specialize (or not) in another school, as you please. <br><br>*Skillpoints: 335<br>Concentration 42(42), Hide 43(55), Listen 41(42), Move Silently 43(57), Open Lock 1(13), Spellcraft 41(45), Tumble 40(52), UMD 41(40), Set Trap 43(55)*<br><br>*Feel free to train in something else, such as disable trap, or another skill of your choosing.<br>-------<br><br>I.

Rogue/Wizards are always nifty, and this is an interesting spin on the concept.<br><br>Your HP is low even for a caster, which is problematic. Drop Still Spell, it's useless, and pick up toughness for those nifty 40 points of HP.<br><br>Your saves are also problematic. Fortitude you can't really do much about, so you'll have to roll with that. Will, by contrast, you can bump simply by moving more wizard levels pre-epic. While this slows down Epic Dodge quite a bit, I think it's overall worth it. AB goes down some, but it's already good enough for an 18th level Wizard.<br><br>If you can find a way to fit Spell Focus in there, too, that'd be nice.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

It looks good Tyr, really well done.  There are a couple of tweaks that might make it slightly better.  <br><br>I'll echo CD's suggestion, picking up 1 AB for free is always a good thing.  <br><br>Also you might want to consider crippling strike instead of improved sneak attack.  2 points of attribute damage a hit, is typically better than 1D6 extra damage.<br><br>Finally, empower or maximize might be better metamagic choices than still spell (or you could take blind-fight or IKD).  You aren't really going to be wearing much armor and even in leather armor arcane failure isn't that big of a problem.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

And while I don't think Still entirely useless, your point be good, and empower def. the better power option (and so, having tweaked a bit, we drop SS for EmpSpell). Also, puts in crippling strike as an option, too (while extra sneak be good, when it comes to PvP, listen to Mith, folks: cripple be better (thanks, Mith). <br><br>As to saves and HPs...As an 18th wiz, got buffs and immunities for just about everything (mind effects/spells, death magic and even crits (polymorph), not to mention stealth, early ED, HiPs, UMD, spellcraft, and other stuff.

Im building this facinating build just now.. just a quick question to anyone.. why not 20 wiz 19 rogue and 1 sd.. <br>I know you get def roll at lvl 5 sd but 2 more rogue lvls get you that and more skill points and an extra d6 on sneak.. and 2 more wizard get a couple more spells (possibly another exta wiz feat).. <br>Just curious before i get up to were it might count in my character. = <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br>Again love the build (although i need a meatshield at the moment lol)

I believe the intention was to avoid going Rogue 16/Wizard 4 pre-epic, which means 2 bonus feats are now non-epic and you have worse saves.   You could push your 1 SD into, say level 8 to get the early HiPS, but you compromise a point of AB.<br><br>So, we assume you want that extra epic feat, resulting in (Rogue 15/ Wizard 4/ SD 1) pre-epic the level 40 difference is:<br>-1 BAB<br>+2d6 SA<br>-1 Reflex<br>-Random SD abilities<br>+4 Skill Points<br>+1 9th level wizard spell<br>+1 7th level spell<br>+1 Caster Level<br>-2 HP<br><br>Plus, 1 level of SD is often considered cheap.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Ariel Thomas on 07/17/07 09:51</span></i></p>

Thanks for the information <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>I'm sure cheapness wont come into it when i play pvp though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  hmm pluses and minuses to it then, but i think i will build it as was intended after all. <br><br>Since you were good enough to explain the differences i do have one other question to ask. How does the ab hit the cap? i cant say i know all the spells but not counting something like true strike i cant really see where the damage or ab will come from?

So a Rogue2/SD2 would have less BAB than a Rogue4, in this case a 2BAB vs. a 3BAB from just the Rogue.  <br><br>In your above example, both FTR/WM/Wiz builds have the same BAB because Fighters and WMs do not lose any BAB, so you can use those interchangeably.

Wow, thank you so much, Rabbac, for all of your great questions and interest in this fun Leprechaun (yes, rogue/wiz are fabulous combos, and anything w. 9 level spells can of course pvp ... that much more fun w. rogue and SD (lots of synnergies, and can go many ways w. this combo, but yes, there are costs/benefits, always to keep in mind; I sent to you some info, and hope you find it helpful.<br><br>And thank you so much Ariel, Cinn and Grizzled One for helping out here - please know that I, too, appreciate it very much, and very kind of you all (why I love this community, really; everyone helping everyone else out!

Really hope this helps, and enjoy (I assure you this character is a ton of fun, gets better once Weap.Fin hits, and is pretty much smooth sailing once you get your HiPs in order, and smile as all your spells come rolling in ... <br><br>More wiz. would def. be a nice variants, but it would in turn cost you an AB point as Ariel et al. point out (i.e., rules of four, unless of course you delay SD til epics, which is okay of course, although I like to get my HiPs in sooner than later (and also, there are many PWs that disallow characters who only take 1 level of SD; if your PW doesn't adhere to that rule, well then, you do have options, just (not to belabor the point, but bears repeating) remember the rule of four, and you'll be fine. Most of all, have fun, and enjoy! <br><br>Again, many thanks for your kind comments and interest in Leprechaun, which I appreciate very much.

Thank you all for your response.. i'm off to lie down now cos my head hurts with so much information lol. <br>Deb Tyr thank you for all my questions I had answered in one go <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  and of course for providing such a great build. I'm struggling a bit (not used to being a rogue!!) but im managing to tag along with a meat shield or two to help me out. Thanks also to the Grizzled one glad to see your still alive and kicking in the forums.. ive read many of your stories <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Pity you dont all play on GvM (ive played there for 5 years now and still know nothing hee hee. <br>I'm inspired and am going to put up a build of my own a dd 22, cleric 16 and 2 assassin for umd and beat the sp penalty. Mr Kaliban99 has done something simular Duergar Crusader......Cleric 17/DwD 18/Assassin 5 but lacks the dr III which i managed to get. Looked good in the tester but i prefer to test them for real on the Mod i play to see how it lvls etc. I look forward to all your comments and suggestions. Back to the grind, life with get easier when i get HIPS. Thanks again, im building as seen <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
