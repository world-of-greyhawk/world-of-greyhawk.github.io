A bit of a roleplay concept that turned out to be a fun build. I had a nifty story for this one, but it was lost when I had to reformat the hard drive and was unable to recover my data <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">  (I may get ambitious and write another, but for now, no story).

Couldn't he pick up a point of AB by taking Bard 6 at level 20 instead of RDD 5? <br><br>TM

If you were to go that route, I would keep the level 22 Bard level, and instead lose the Level 27 bard level.  Better to get +5 ac at Level 22, than to wait until Level 27 to get +6 ac<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.
