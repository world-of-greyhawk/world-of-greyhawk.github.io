So I've taken a look at the Fighter/Ranger/Wm builds listed on the build searcher, and I'm a little disappointed. I haven't seen anyone take advantage of how much damage Ranger/Fighter can combine for. (I saw a Scythe build, but that's 2 handed, so you only get the bonus damage once).<br><br><br>The purpose of this build is to kill things. Lots of things.

This doesn't rely on sneak damage though, so they'll get a nice surprise. <br><br>I'll put this through some exercises later to try and slim it down a little.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 07/04/10 16:03</span></i></p>

I am not sure how to take this.  One of the requirements is to have a LEGAL build.  As far as i am aware, "free feat" isnt a feat that i found  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   <br><br>On a serious note, You leave the build with 2 empty feats, why didnt you finish it?  In my mind, there are ALOT more than 2 "free feats" so to leave it unfinished has a sloppiness to it.  What others have done is actually take feats (like 2 gr str for +1 dam and +1 ab) and put an "*" to denote an optional feat.<br><br>Other than that, it is nice to see a fresh idea.

That would be something I overlooked between my typing it up in notepad, and posting it here. The free feats are for either more damage, or if you do feel sneaky, epic focus in those skills.

This sort of build usually fits into the sort of high magic server that has lots of immunities available, where ac isn't so much of an issue.<br><br>Other than that this toon is a good party attack-dog..

@jumjones I use it on I suppose moderate magic servers usually. It's always squishy, the goal is just to kill a couple people before you either die, or are in dire need of healing.<br><br>@Grimnir77 I had seen that, but in the midst of my typing most of this up a couple weeks ago while waiting to get accepted into the guild, it sort of slipped my mind. <br><br>The main difference does come from, the Grim Ripper making an effort to have higher AC and more skill points. I found in my playing that a little more AC never saved me any. As I mentioned, most folks still only miss on a 1. The 6 AC from armor skin and cross classed tumble never helped me. More health just lets you get beat on a little longer.<br><br>Although the Scythe is banned on the server I played on, it still comes back to 1h vs. 2h weapons. I picked the duel-wielded kukri for this largely because it capitalizes on the fact that Weapon Specs, and FE/Bane don't gain any bonus from applying on a 2h weapon, so I chose to apply them more often with duel-wielding. The power attack.. yeah.. that's a bit of overkill, and largely a situational ability, I use it when I catch a player resting, seeing as they're easy to hit, and it adds to the assurance they'll die in the first round.<br><br>Some other things that are possible with this is to play as an elf, which allows spotting. Hand axes are another option, I favor more critical hits before larger ones though. I suppose without exotic weapons, you could take power attack earlier, and use cleave, great cleave, and overwhelming critical as your 'free feats'.<br><br>Taking Ranger at level 1 is something I overlooked, and I'll have to remember to do that on occasions I cast.
