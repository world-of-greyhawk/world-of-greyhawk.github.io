The stats in the saved character section are never right, cause they get calculated with the preepic progression also in epic levels. Look only at the stats in game and better yet at the logs (with combat debugging enabled possibly). Your BAB is 25, for example, not 29.<br><br>You'll have to forgive me, but I can't hold it back: it's <b>rogue</b>, damnit, <b>R-O-G-U-E</b> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>PM me the right stats after checking them up in game, please, I'll edit them in.<br><br>Now, you are not taking any weapon foci and no EP and your AB is really low, when it could easily be an acceptable 41. AS would help too and so would Blind Fight and KD/IKD or Called Shot. Spring Attack is a waste, although you are probably taking it only as a prerequisite for WWA, which is no big deal, actually, apart at the lower levels. I'd drop both of them to get better feats preepic. Stealthy is probably droppable, your stealthy skills are good enough. Epic Shadowlord also is no big deal better get something else (and the choice is wide).<br><br>HPs are too low, drop WIS to 8 and raise CON to 12. STR 14 is too expensive for a dexer halfling , go with 12 and free up another 4 points.<br><br>Actually I'd get more Rogue in for the sneaks. What about some fighter levels for extra feats and possibly WS/EWS to give you some dmg output?<br><br>Skills: where's set trap? A dexer sneaker with low damage output is gonna need to set traps to prepare the battle field. Points in spellcraft will improve your saves vs spells too. Drop one of spot or listen and put those points in set trap and spellcraft. I'd get less open locks and search too, usually you don't need such high values in those skills.<br><br>I guess that's all for now, just a few suggestion after a quick glance.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 06/22/06 21:49</span></i></p>

I'd definitely consider taking a couple levels of either fighter or COT to get a 4th attack and a couple combat feats.  You really need weapon focuses and so forth.<br><br>The epic shadowlord is actually quite a nice summon, but you have to buff him improved invisibility because he loses his concealment bonus when he turns from normal to epic.  It's still worth doing though, the epic one has much better stats in other regards.  And he gets stronger with SD levels, so that's possibly why the build is so SD-heavy.<br><br>Still, you'd be better off IMO with more rogue for sneak dice... no summon is ever as good as the player who summoned it.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Hmmm ... at level 25, Shadow Evade is quite nice, and gives a good concealment bonus in addition to DR. You may want to think about dropping SC completely, since you already have undispellable concealment in that form.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

Thanks for the advice!<br><br>I decided to go for more fighter and rogue and less shadowdancer. That does take away from my "Master of Shadows" plan, but thats okay. <br><br>Right now, I am thinking Rogue 25/Fighter 14/Shadowdancer 1. With that, I will have a nice 13d6 Sneak Attack, a better Fortidtude save, better AB, Weapon Foci, Weapon Spec., EP, plus I should still be able to get Self-Concealment, Epic Dodge and Epic Skill Foci.<br><br>I'll work on the build some tonight and post an updated version when I finish it!

Well, I finished the build and will post it after I have a chance to test it (probably sometime tomorrow night).<br><br>It worked out pretty well. I was able to squeeze in most of what I wanted, plus I fit in KD, IKD and Improved Critical.<br><br>I did have to give up 2 fairly important feats, though. I couldn't fit in Crippling Strike or Slippery Mind because I had to use the Rouge bonus feats for Self-Conceal.

You haven't put any feats in fighter 10 and 12, I assume EWF and EWS? Aside from that, check out the other builds with the same level-scheme and check if they look like yours? If not, you can post it as a new post. <br><br>About the build, it's way better, at least way more my style than the first one. It's a pretty standard build though, I often end mine on Fighter10/SD1/Rogue29.<br>A build with SD1 will be better than a build with SD25 99 out of 100 times.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>
