I am curious what determines the level of the rakasha's damage for his spells. as well what determines the DC's for it? I know about the empowered and maximized feats. I've been tryin to find the info for this on nwn's websites and have come out inconclusive...<br><br>-FoG

It uses your highest caster level (most likely Druid, as the most effective Rakshasa build must be Druid 28/Shifter 10/Monk 2). Spell DCs are calculated as follows: 10 + spell level + ability modifier + spell foci.<br>_________________<br>Now is my day's work done;<br>I'll take good breath:<br>Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of<br>blood and death.

Shifter levels have no effect in spell DCs nor penetration power/damage/SR checks. However, some special abilities in your shapes use your Shifter level for calculating the DCs and uses per day.

hey i also had a question about the rakasha build. when refering to highest DC, the PW i belong to has a minimum class selection of 4. any new class you take must have 4 lvls before 20. also, if any new class is taken after 20 you must have 4. so how ever you do it, multiples of 20 lvls must have 4 lvls.<br><br>soo.... what would you suggest as making a rakasha build, i was thinking something on the line of druid 24/shifter 10/ monk 6 (KD feat). Or druid 26/shifter 10/monk 4 and gain more DC for ice stroms. granted id have to work the lvls a bit to fit in all my feats.

The only thing that would change is how hard to dispel your buffs are, DC and damage are the same (you get +1d6 cold damage on 27th lvl)

There is no DC check for Ice Storm.  It is a simple matter of beating your target's Spell Resistance.  This is why having max Druid levels + Epic Spell Penetration is ideal for a build focusing on Rakshasa.<br><br>Only Druid levels count for casting spells in Rak form.  This determins your chance to beat SR as well as the max damage of the spell.  Take maximize spell as memming a maxed version will allow you to cast it unlimited in Rak form.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/" target="_blank">http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Talamier on 12/13/05 04:55</span></i></p>

Is it true only for maxed versions of ice storms or also for empowered ones?

Yep - Ice Storm has no save no matter what metamagic type is used. <br><br>Spell Resistance is the only factor that needs to be beaten
