Bane of all – Ranger (35), Fighter (4), Shadowdancer (1)<br><br>  I was trying to make an effective Strength based sneaker in PvM, and I thought up 35 Ranger / 1 ShD / 4 Fighter. The concept is rather simple. A large Half-Orc with 12 FEs, a greataxe, and the ability to HIPS. The build is quite similar to WhiZard's "The Lawnmower", although there are obvious differences.<br><br>P.S One of my first attempts on a PvM build. Go easy on me. <br><br><br>Half-Orc, Any Alignment <br>PvM (1-40)<br><br>Strength: 16 (28)<br>Dexterity: 14<br>Constitution: 14<br>Wisdom: 14<br>Intelligence: 12<br>Charisma: 6<br><br>Hitpoints: 386<br>Skillpoints: 209<br>Saving throws (Fortitude/Reflex/Will) 25/20/18<br>BAB: 29<br>AB: +42/+37/+32/+27<br>Ac: 18 (Studded Leather on)<br>+2 A vs. 12 out of 24 favored enemies<br><br>Damage: 1-12+20+7+2d6<br><br>Skills<br>Hide 43<br>Move Silently 43<br>Open Lock 1<br>Set Trap 43<br>Tumble 20<br>Discipline 43<br>Listen 43<br><br><br>1 Ranger: Stealthy, Favored Enemy<br>2 Fighter: Knockdown<br>3 Fighter: Dodge, Mobility<br>4 Fighter:<br>5 Ranger:<br>6 Ranger: Weapon Focus (Greataxe),<br>7 Ranger:<br>8 Ranger: Favored Enemy,<br>9 Ranger: SKill Focus (Hide)<br>10 Ranger:<br>11 ShD:<br>12 Ranger: Improved Critical (Greataxe)<br>13 Ranger:<br>14 Ranger: Favored Enemy<br>15 Ranger: Skill Focus (Move Silently)<br>16 Ranger:<br>17 Ranger:<br>18 Ranger: Blindfight<br>19 Ranger: Favored Enemy<br>20 Ranger:<br>21 Ranger: Epic Weapon Focus (Greataxe)<br>22 Ranger:<br>23 Ranger:<br>24 Fighter: Weapon specialization (Greataxe), Epic Weapon Specialization (Greataxe)<br>25 Ranger: Favored Enemy<br>26 Ranger:<br>27 Ranger: Bane of Enemies<br>28 Ranger:<br>29 Ranger: Favored Enemy<br>30 Ranger:<br>31 Ranger: Epic Skill Focus (Hide), Epic Prowess<br>32 Ranger: Favored Enemy<br>33 Ranger: Epic skill Focus (Move Silently)<br>34 Ranger: Favored Enemy<br>35 Ranger: Favored Enemy<br>36 Ranger: Great Strength 1<br>37 Ranger: Favored Enemy<br>38 Ranger:<br>39 Ranger: Great Strength 2<br>40 Ranger: Favored Enemy, Favored Enemy<br><br>Pros: Fairly awesome damage against 12 monsters of your choice, as well as against non-favored enemies. High hide and move silently for a STR build. The ability to HIPS out of most situations. Decent AB for a sneaker. <br><br>Cons: Lack of defense, low saves, lack of UMD<br><br>Remember to use ranger spells for the +24 hide, +4 Move silently. It gets me 73ish hide and 56 move silently at level 40, which is fairly decent for a str sneaker.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 05/25/09 13:46</span></i></p>
