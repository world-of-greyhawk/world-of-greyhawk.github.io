Hey all,<br><br>as per topic, I'm wondering if NWN the first is still alive and kickin' today? I'd like to get back into the game and on a good friendly PW. Any regulars on these forums - I think I've seen Grimnir and Thax post - still? Where do you guys play?<br><br>Thanks,<br>finnyman <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br><i>Ghaash agh akûl - Nazgûl skoiz<br>Mirdautas vras!<br>Karn ghaamp agh nût<br>Shaut Manwe quiinubat gukh</i><br><br>Summoning - Mirdautas Vras<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 04/28/10 11:32</span></i></p>

There are tons of servers left out there, many have died, reasonably enough, some have hardly any playerbase left, but quite a few are still going very strong. The best bet it to log back on and see for yourself what is still there. My server regulars over 15 people (at any time of day) and up to 50 during the evenings.

As far as I'm concerned, the World of Greyhawk is just entering it's glory days.  The land is more expansive than ever, w/ more places to go than one could see with even several different characters.  As far as ECBers, Kail still plays regularly.  Grizz and the Great Cinnamon Bun are around occasionally, though I believe both are often caught up elsewhere.  Vernix has not been seen in quite some time.<br><br>In any event, it's more action focused (though w/ an immersive, interesting world, which IMO makes it RP focused as well), and aside from clerical restrictions (boo), is fairly close to standard NWN.  It's 1-40 (and really is 1-40), and eminently replayable.  The activitely level has stayed strong for quite some time now, and there are all sorts of regular parties going, with new ones formed frequently.  I've got an awful schedule, so I mostly solo, with the occasional happy party play.  Either is certainly possible.  Forum link in sig.<br>_________________<br>I'd rather be logged on to the <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk</a>.

Just wanted to mention another great mod, Dor Maeglin, I've been playing on it for about 7 years now.  Once you get started in it you're hooked.  The regulars there are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.  There is no requirement for role playing, but you can if you like.  Full details are below if you'd like to join in on the fun!<br><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Gameworld.Detail&amp;id=1288" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

Saw this recently concerning how nwn 1 is doing... thought i'd post it. someone can make a new post as well if they think it is useful.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>From Inayity in NWN Bioware Forums<br><br>Quote:<br>Some interesting news I haven't seen on here yet. A couple of gaming sites have been reporting that Atari has signed a deal with Good Old Games for digital distribution of the Atari catalog.<br><br>Good Old Games is a Polish company which specializes in taking critically-acclaimed but older games, removing any DRM, making the games Vista and XP-compatible and then selling them dirt cheap via their digital distribution network.<br><br>While the lawsuit between Hasbro and Atari has left a lot of users uncertain about whether or not the Baldur's Gate series and (of course) the Neverwinter Nights series will be coming to the service, there's quite a bit of hope on this end that such legal wranglings won't have an impact on old games like NWN.<br><br>One other thing, these guys at GOG were founded by a company called CD-Projekt. If you haven't heard of them, they were responsible for the Polish localization of the NWN series and were also the only company to actually license the Aurora engine, the engine which drives NWN, to create The Witcher. So not only have they heard of NWN, they forked over the big bucks to get their hands on the source code to make their own game with it.<br><br>Anyway, pop on over to GOG.com and check it out.<br><br>If you make an account on their site you can vote for the "most-wanted" games. Various flavors of NWN are already represented in the voting but it could use a little more lovin' It is also worth noting that users have also requested the discontinued Premium modules as well and those can be voted for too.<br><br>Neverwinter Nights via digital distribution is something I'd like to see, wouldn't you?<br><br><br>What this means is that if there are enough votes for NWN, it can be one of the top games of GOG that can be re-distributed. If this garners enough success, this CAN revive NWN. I urge you all, NWNers, to come and vote. Go here <a href="http://www.gog.com/en/wanted/" target="_blank">http://www.gog.com/en/wanted/</a> and type in Neverwinter Nights. It is sad that it has so little votes, yet it is a critically acclaimed game that is still prospering online!<br><br>NWN is slowly dying. It has less and less players each year. You know Project CQ and nwshader and all those other graphical overrides? If people see that, they WON'T think of NWN as just another old RPG. It's a CLASSIC.<br><br><a href="http://www.gog.com/en/wanted/" target="_blank">http://www.gog.com/en/wanted/</a><br><br>(NOT SUGGESTED)<br>Please note that, account creation is NOT email validated, nor does it have authorization codes. This means you can create an account as many times as you want and VOTE again and again. We only need about 4000 votes! Please.<br><br>^ Because of that, I highly suggest someone makes a macro or bot to do it. Much easier because of no email or authorization code required.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>xxxxxxxxx(name removed for privacy sake), a fellow nwn player </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->
