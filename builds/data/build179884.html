Start him as a monk with a high WIS and INT for skillpoints to use in tumble to boost that AC 10 points with skillfocus and epic skillfocus tumble. You also may want to see about taking enough monk to use quivering palm, as the DC on it is WIS based. I have read that the terrifying rage can be accomplised with less than epic levels in barbarian but I have never tested that.

1. Do you need more than 25 skill points in Intimidate? Most other Barb builds only go to 25 to qualify for the Rage feats.<br><br>2. Do us a favor and mimic how other people post their builds. ie use standard formatting such as paragraphs to make your build easier to read. It's tough to read when it all blurs together.<br><br>K.<br>_________________<br>Check out the Epic Character Builders Guild<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Test your new builds in this mod:<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/modules/data/1073117317280.shtml" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

Not trying to get personal here mate; but punctuation and a little bit of order to the words please?  It sounds like an interesting build though.

Fie! I should have been taking armor skin and dodge all this time. Time to weep uncontrollably! My AC's could have been 3 points higher. I am a fool. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">
