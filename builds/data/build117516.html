Hi guys,<br><br>I noticed that someone before posted a request for a more Magically orientated build.. and well here is one that I am toying with at the moment.<br><br>Race: Human Alignment: Lawful Good<br>Str:10<br>Dex:13<br>Con:10<br>Int:14<br>Wis:10<br>Cha:17<br><br><br>Level Class Notes.<br>1 Sorcerer Spell Penetration, Toughness<br>2 Sorcerer(2)<br>3 Paladin(1) Weapon Focus(Long Sword)<br>4 Sorcerer(3) Cha +1(18)<br>5 Paladin(2)<br>6 Paladin(3) Divine Shield<br>7 Sorcerer(4)<br>8 Sorcerer(5) Cha +1(19)<br>9 Paladin(4) Extra Turning<br>10 Sorcerer(6)<br>11 Sorcerer(7)<br>12 Sorcerer(8) Cha+1(20)Empower Spell<br>13 Sorcerer(9)<br>14 Sorcerer(10)<br>15 Sorcerer(11) Combat Casting<br>16 Sorcerer(12) Cha +1(21)<br>17 Sorcerer(13)<br>18 Sorcerer(14) Still Spell<br>19 Sorcerer(15)<br>20 Sorcerer(16) Cha +1(22)<br>21 Sorcerer(17) Imp.

Wearing Full Plate should add another +8, using a Tower Shield should add another 3 plus the bonus from a near tp maxed cross class tumble(20)+4 making the basic bonus without wasting any spell other than Eagles Splendour<br><br>10 +11(13)+ 8 + 3 + 4 = 36. (tack on Epic Mage Armour and epic warding and you will have ac 56 with a dr of 50/+20 for 26 rounds.)<br><br>This can easily be boosted by further enhancing damage resistance and better equpment... so it is forseeable that by 33rd Level you should have a character who has a reasonably high AC able to cast epic spells without fear of miscast.<br><br>For the Sorcerers familiar I took the sprite for the utility value of her however if you feel you need more combat feel free to take something else<br><br>Anyways the idea was to take the maximum advantage from the character's high Charisma as possible using classes that take advantage of the high Charisma. Whilst still maintaining a strong spell casting character who won't fall over in combat too easily.<br><br>So that is the idea I had.. deliberately avoiding PM and RDD (as this was also complained about)to hopefully produce a well rounded combat caster.<br>_________________<br>Character creation is a matter of style. When creating a character one should always strive for effect or image.<br><br>The smart player knows that every image is flawed and acknowledges this as part of the character that adds to its charm.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 02:35</span></i></p>

Doesn't work, I'm afraid.  You need Power Attack as a prerequisite for Divine Shield, and -that- requires a 13 strength which you don't have.<br><br>I spotted this thread because I'm actually planning on the exact same level build, but with somewhat different emphasis (I go for full auto-still by 27, for example).  When I've got it worked out I'll post on another thread.<br><br>Qwinn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Qwinn69 on 03/09/08 22:14</span></i></p>

Starting stats are easily adjustable and one feat can be dropped for Power Attack. I'd go for STR 13, DEX 8, CON 14, WIS 10. Dodge, Mobility and especially Spring Attack would be on my to drop list together with CC/ICC (which, btw, is taken before it is legal to do so).<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "122070", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Battlemage</a> is similar to this build and almost legal (but for ICC), although one is still left questioning some stats.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 03/10/08 11:27</span></i></p>

Keep in mind this build was posted 4 years ago, so at that time I don't think there was the requirement to test the builds before posting.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
