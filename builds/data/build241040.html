Having had something to do with the layout of this build I can offer some little insight in some of the choices, wich is to say my perception of the wishes of the OP regarding this build.<br><br>The "missing" shapes are missing because the intent was to have a "boxing" build. At first only Outsider Shape, for Death Slaad was taken, but the lowish AB of the form (due to a lack of an enhancement bonus on creature weapons and a modest STR score) not to mention already having to pump up WIS to 25 to qualify for the feat, suggested to go for Construct Shape too, to take advantage of construct immunities and higher STR (= higher AB). Both forms are viable and each has advantages of its own. <br><br>Regarding WIS: since it already got pumped and since it influences both AC in all forms and ranged AB and spells DCs while unshifted increasing it some more came natural. Remember the OP's wish was to have a boxing build using these forms only, he didn't care about the other shapes, not even Rakshasa (which he already gets) as far as I can tell. <br>Also consider that by decreasing starting WIS to 16, Outsider shape would get delayed (till 30th lvl I'd say).<br><br>About expertise: I suggested it along with Zen Archery to help while unshifted and before getting the epic shapes. It's one of those "optional" feats in my interpretation.<br><br>About shifter's "epicity": as Grim pointed out, a shifter, for some mysterious reason, is considered epic at 10th lvl by the engine.<br><br>I've got an all shapes druid/shifter/monk soon to be posted. It's an interesting build which is just waiting for me to find some time to write a background story. Compared to this it misses -1 AC, 10% speed, 4 stunning fists a day and IE but it gets all epic shapes. This build would have feat slots to spend on WF to improve unarmed AB, unfortunately they ain't working while shifted.<br><br>I'll edit the OP's post to include Death Slaad and Iron Golem stats... and to correct my name which is Kail, not Kali! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

As I understand it, the reason that the unarmed weapon focus:unarmed and epic weapon focus: unarmed feats don't work is because when you shift you equip creature weapons which you can't focus in.  I remember a while back I found that some of the forms in polymorph self didn't equip creature weapons and you could use those feats.

The golem shape's a lot more powerful, simply by virtue of merging your items and not just your armor.  How I wish druid elemental shapes merged items... *pets his Mystic Druid*<br><br>It's an interesting build concept but I think even buffed, both shapes are a bit too weak in the AB department, especially as they don't merge weapons.  The Slaad's pretty-good AC and regeneration may, however, make for an interesting defensive form - I'd actually consider going all the way to improved expertise for this purpose.  And since the golem merges items, you might be able to get an AB bonus from wearing monk gloves for him.  Not sure, may test.<br><br>Also, not to nitpick, but if you switched monk 10 at 39 with druid 17 at 40, you should be able to pick Dragon Shape at 39 at the cost of 1 wisdom.  Then you can consider going back to tinker with your base stats and/or level progression, or otherwise fiddle.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

BTW, the build has got a Stunning Fist DC = 41 (45 self buffed, 47 WIS capped).<br><br>I also agree with my fellow posters that getting DS at  least would benefit the build and considering dragon fight unarmed it would keep with the "boxing" build flavour.

7 attacks is the maximum per round for an unarmed monk.<br><br>5 normal progression, 1 haste, 1 flurry.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Just to touch on a couple of things that I seem to recall from my experience playing shifters:<br><br>1) Golem shape uses Unarmed, which is why you can Stunning Fist with it, and the Unarmed Focus feat will work with it. You could get Dev and go Golem Shape if you wanted to, could be a pretty neat character. I only know this because I made a 55+ DC Stunning Fist Druid/Shifter/Monk. (Was very very cool, too, by the way. I went all wisdom and used Iron Golem's naturally high strength and Druid buffs for AB)<br><br>2) I -believe- that Regeneration on Gloves transfers to shapes. Don't quote me 100% on this, but I recall testing it at one point, and I believe it worked. Further, more updated testing might be required for authenticity.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Acothea on 05/23/06 09:42</span></i></p>

I haven't tested Dev Crit specifically with Golem, but the word is that it ain't working with any of the "unarmed" shifted shapes. You can use SF with Dragon Shape too for example, so being able to use it with Golem is no surprise at all.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free
