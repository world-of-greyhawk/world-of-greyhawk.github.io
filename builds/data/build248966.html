The difference between this and the undead Death Dealer Build is the charisma and the resulting possibilty to use the few bard spells(hoylsword +darkness is a deadyl combo) , it can use the bard song for 1 ab w/o perform items , it has higher saves , especially when it comes to reflex saves( to save vs sunburst , chainlightning ,bb's) . Also the taunt is pretty high and hard to resist. He also has a way higher ac which makes him to be more of an ac tank than a hp tank. <br><br>Sorry that I forgot to mention him , I did a search though and must say I was surprised that there was only 1 build with that classcombo.As I stated the other build has no cha thats why I thought this one might be worth posting.<br><br>Thx for editing and sry<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By bloodymerc on 08/05/06 14:22</span></i></p>

Interesting (and yeah, love the title, too!

As to ideas, I'm with Grim &amp; Kail: don't underestimate Pally buffs, they may be few but, and notwithstanding dispel factor, they be good; on the other hand, you're DM/DS can't be dispelled <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    With these, + Pally buffs, + PM immunities, not to mention that undead buddy and arm thing, you can comfortably drop some str. for Cha., and thus get that monk-like AC of yours up even further; also, I'd drop ExTurn for toughness or something; at 20 pally, you've enough charges (&amp; finding con items, well, str-items far easier &amp; much more plentiful); more HPs thus good, yes?   <br><br>Otherwise, nice going, Merc <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 08/06/06 21:26</span></i></p>

Interesting build. I've thought about something like this before, and this is a good one I think. (Hardcore roleplayers will probably wither and die if they see this, but it's okay in my books.)<br><br>A note on Turn Undead, Tyr: the charges are based on your CHA modifier only, not your level. so he needs Extra Turning to get enough charges to be useful with the low CHA.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Hey, Cinn: Nice to see ya, and excellent point (though, I think he's using charges more for DM/DS, no?). Anyway, good point: and more reason to raise cha, instead of str. Here, he can come down AB 41 or even 40, rely on buffs/str. items for extra, and instead pump his cha (nat stats, not dispellable, nor is cha-based stuff (ie., DM/DS) crippled by rogue); Alternatively, if he wants to keep extra turn and str, can play around w. start stats: drop 1 str (15), pump 2 into con (+2 con = 40 hps, same as toughness, but w. +1 fort: actually, now that I think about it, even better, and he'll keep his extra charges, too. Can also take at leaast one grt cha, instead of STr (evens str out, just - 1 AB/dam for no buff AB 42, but gets it back + more in buffs); also gives him ability to maybe pick up extra point on an eagle's roll 5 ... I'd be inclined to take it further, but that's just me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     <br><br>As to hardcore RP, well, some might call me a pally fan, and I might even have been known to mix a pally or two in w. bard (works for me!!!) As to the fallen ones, well,...BG has fiend friend, whereas this one gets not only an undead buddy, but also the arm thing ... hmmm, I can't see the diff, can you see the diff? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">         (but yeah, hears ya: when it comes to those hardcore RP'rs, well, mere fact there's multi-class alone can displease them, regardless of classes chosen. Then, look at the AC here: just don't know what they're missing <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 08/06/06 22:25</span></i></p>

Thx all <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>To cha/str balancing :<br><br>I wanted to retain as much ab as possible, because the more you hit the earlier holy aven works.Thats why i went with 10con only too , to get more ab.In most PWs you can get +5stuff at least (ive not seen many with less ac) which gives monks or dexers pretty nice ac.  if you play in a lower magic world more cha is def. worth it. <br>But always remeber ,divine shield is dodge ac and so are 5 pts of epic mage armor. So as soon as you can max out your charisma , get haste and +3ac off boots you can reach the dodge ac cap with only 14base cha.<br>However in some environments its better to get a longer duration and more divine dmg.

The version of the 20 4 16 I play is slightly different;<br><br>Starting str 18 --&gt; 30<br><br>scimitar (rapier?!), instead of divne might/shield &amp; extra turning; cleave, great cleave &amp; knockdown<br><br>epic feats: ewf, ep, esf: discipline, eer: fire, ema, gt str I &amp; II, over + dev. crit<br><br>basically less damage, less AC, more AB, higher crit range &amp; dev<br><br>20 4 16s very solid build though!

You see, Avado: there be fallen pallys and other things that go bump in the night out there (and thus, good reason for a LG pally with high AB, and holy sword sure helps out, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">         As to the weapon, Merc, with your AC potential, go for the greatsword or greataxe; this way, you deal decent damage, now add DM &amp; all those buffs; as said earlier, if it were me, I'd def. go for more HPs; in your case, +/- 1 AB is not gonna make any real difference -- you're relying on equipment &amp; buffs; then, maybe I'm not as much of the gambling type ...    <br><br>For most things out there, if you be getting all that gear you seek, yer AC sure be tough, and PM immunities, well...

@ krsboss: On the server I play that build Dev is not allowed , thats why I got room to fit in divine stuff. <br>On BoW , yeah go with the dev version. I just realized your in my guild lol. cheers nike<br><br>It should be Battleaxe , not waraxe...my bad ^^        As for greatsword , I would only pick one if i need it to bypass dr to make my holyaven work.Scythe could be pretty nice as well for really nasty crits.(could give up 1 bab ,go 16pal 8bard and pick up keen,displacement)  love the ac too much ^^ and when i think about all the other melee chars and their 65 abs , i want the ac.
