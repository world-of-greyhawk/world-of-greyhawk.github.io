I am looking to build a cleric on a low magic server I currently play on. This means I will not be able to get any items that increase strength, con etc. So, I have to do a bit of balancing in her construction.<br><br>The purpose of the cleric is primarily for party play - - -to buff the melee fighters and then wade through the fray to heal them. Also, an occassional Word of Faith to help turn the tide of battle never hurts! <br><br>I believe I need to take Trickery as a domain to get improved invis which is critical in this world. Also, I need to be able to cast Freedom as that is another critical spell. I am not sure if I have to take Travel to get that or not.<br><br>There are significant rest restrictions on the server, so I need to make sure that I level the cleric in a way that spells don't diappear after a few minutes of "real" time. <br><br>Turn Undead is not at all useful in this world.<br><br>Devastating Critical is disabled on this server, so I do not need a Pale Master build to avoid this. As a matter of fact, I believe only PCs can get criticals, and this character would never be used for PvP. However, dragons hit HARD so a good AC would be really useful.<br><br>I was thinking a cleric / monk combo to add the wisdom score to the AC might be good, but I am open to just about any combo. There are no restrictions in this world about taking a single level of bard to get to RDD, for example, so I am flexible on that.<br><br>Thanks for your help!
