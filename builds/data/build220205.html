What's a Half-Human? What's the other half? And if he's only <i>Half</i>-Human, how does he get two feats at first level as a rogue?<br><br>In general, you should put the class level in the character leveling scheme so people understand better what is being taken at what level. eg:<br>1 Rogue 1 - Dodge<br>2 Rogue 2 <br>3 Cleric 1 - Extend Spell<br><br>Are these characters that you have created in-game or on-paper? One of your closing stats says "I think". If you haven't built the character you should mention that in the intro so people know it's a theoretical build at this point.<br><br>Also, I'm pretty sure that putting your character name in the build title means nothing to anyone but you. *shrug* It's easier for us to refer to a build if it has a name or title we can repeat without having to Cut &amp; Paste some cryptic, Half-Human utterance. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br>Intelligent design is neither.

"Race: Half-Human ( Love the CEP goat legs )"<br>Subraces doest change what the base race is, that being human, i thought it clear that i was using CEP pak to craft armour so that i would have goat legs, hence the Half-Human<br><br>All toons are created via "the halls of advanced", i though the rules ment you must build it. I also stated that i played this build on action server a few times<br><br>The "i think" is too allow leeway for mistakes as i made some minor changes at the time and could well null the build(change to Xuldran would of been Wis instead of Str early on, but if i did change it i didnt rebuild it at time as its a minor thing, might change saves? not sure what diff it makes, sometimes you just want to throw in a feat here or there after the build is made, which shouldnt be too bad as your just adjusting once your done)<br>Looking over it, i wrote it once? in reference to not knowing how many total skillpoints one char had, a minor thing as most people will choose own skills/spells<br><br>Quite agree, should of done level guide/title better, too bad you cant edit<br>Thank you got your comment
