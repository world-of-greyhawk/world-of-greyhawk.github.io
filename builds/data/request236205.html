How would you place feats and levels and stats if you have this build to make?<br><br>1 Barb, 8 sorc, 21 Monk.. And it has to be halfling...<br><br>This build is just to make the fastest monk possible.

If all you want is running speed.. just make it 40 levels of monk. That plus haste is more then plenty

Even if they did stack, you would still be faster with more monk levels. Monk speed continues to increase up to level 38, where it maxes at 210%. Barbarian Endurance only adds 10%, vs. 60% increase from Monk 21 to Monk 38 (150% to 210%). So the fastest possible character is a hasted Monk with 38+ Monk levels.<br><br>But you can make a better character by dropping a few more levels and doing some more multiclassing. Dropping to Monk 35 only costs you 10%, and even down to 30 only costs 30% (still have 180%, noticeably faster than a hasted character while the monk is unhasted).<br><br>TM

If you're really crazy for speed then take the 38 monk levels, it's much more than what's needed, I think a Monk 35 / Fighter 5 can work very well using a bow with EWS, with that speed, and add haste, normal melees won't ever hit you.<br><br>However, since you want the "fastest" possible, I guess that Barbarian speed not stacking (for a Monk 38 / Barbarian 2), leaves your speed in the same limit as any pure monk build.

Heck, if you just want to make a super bow-based Run'n'gun build, just go Monk 10/Wiz 1/AA 29. That will give you a 30% speed boost, enough to keep out of reach of any non-monk character (trade a few more AA levels for Monk if you want more speed).<br><br>TM

Hey, I agree with you Tatooed Monk, but he clearly stated:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;This build is just to make the fastest monk possible.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>A Monk 35 / Fighter 5 can get EWS and 200% speed + permhaste and you'll get out of sight of people in 4 seconds or less. Now, I just said, that ultra speed deserves a bow.

Why not like...I dunno...something like 38 monk/ 1 rogue / 1 SD<br><br>Then you get max speed, super stealth with HiPS, and UMD to use haste scrolls and possibly expedius retreat, that will really boost your speed and you could do it all while under the amazing effects of HiPS. I dunno how smart this is because I myself, am not overly smart...so take it how you will but you can rest assured it would be fun to play.<br><br>Hehe...million-mile-an-hour, Unseeable, scroll flinging, halfling.

Hmm..<br><br>Yes..

No, 30 monk is the fastest you can get (Barb speed does not stack with monk). On that server, a halfling pure monk would be the fastest possible. Of course, halflings get the lower unarmed damage, and the higher dual-wield penalty for kamas, so you will be choosing between speed and AB or damage.<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 04/19/06 14:45</span></i></p>
