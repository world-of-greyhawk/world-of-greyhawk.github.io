On his 10th birthday Arashi got what he had always dreamed of - his first sword.  He lived in a humble village but he had more than the other children.  His father, Izande, was a legendary sword smith able to cast the most brutal weapon of the Samurai - the Katana.  The king of his province would always purchase his swords for the best of his warriors when war was imminent.<br><br>As Arashi grew older, he was able to meet and befriend these great warriors, who at each passing would train Arashi with his new sword.  Many years passed and many great warriors died in the battlefield but Arashi had trained with them all and one day he himself became one of the greatest warriors of all.  When he had reached the age of 18, his father crafted him a Katana that he had started when he was 12.  He folded, sharpened, and worked the sword between orders for the king.  He told Arashi it was his finest sword and that he would have no one but wield it.<br><br>Word got out to the king that Izande crafted a sword unlike no other.  The king got jealous and traveled to Izande’s black smithy.  He demanded he turn over the sword for his personal body guard but Izande refused.  In a furious rage, the King killed Izande where he stood.  They searched for Arashi and his sword but he was nowhere to be found…<br><br>Days after his 18th birthday, Arashi decided to follow his inner spiritual path and traveled far to the west to live with the Monks.  They had a great monastery with many books and elders who would pass knowledge down to those who were worthy.  Arashi studied with them and fought by their side for 7 years.  He had become a great warrior, and an even better tactician.  Though he was never wise like the monks, he showed great intelligence in both tactics and enemy weaknesses.<br><br>When Arashi returned home, the villagers had explained what happened to him many years ago.  Arashi visited his father grave and prayed…<br><br>What happens next is more myth than fact, but it is said that once Arashi mourned his father, he took up his father’s blade along with his own and traveled to the king’s palace.  The king had hundreds of soldiers and many skilled archers but he somehow managed to maim or kill any that did not flee from his vengeance.  In the end, the king sat dead in his thrown, his blood dripping down the blade Izande once owned.<br><br>No one knows what happened to Arashi since that day.  Some believe he went back to the monastery to live the monks.  Others believe he headed north to the great mountains for solace.  One thing was for certain, after the king’s death, there was a long lasting peace in the land as it seemed no one wished to invade the province any more.<br><br>-------------------------------<br>Arashi the Humble Samurai	Human Fighter 14 / Weaponmaster 20 / Monk 6<br><br>Str	16(32)<br>Dex	15<br>Con	14<br>Int	14<br>Wis	8<br>Cha	8<br><br><b>Playable 1-40 PvM</b><br>Alignment: Lawful &lt;any&gt;<br><br>1)Fighter	Dodge, WP-Exotic, WF-Katana<br>2)Fighter	Ambidexterity<br>3)Fighter	TWF<br>4)Fighter	Mobility				(Str)<br>5)Fighter<br>6)Fighter	Spring Attack, Expertise<br>7)Fighter<br><br> 8 )Fighter	Whirlwind Attack		(Str)<br>9)WM		Improved Critical-Katana<br>10)WM<br>11)WM<br>12)WM		Power Attack			(Str)<br>13)WM<br>14)WM<br>15)WM		Cleave<br>16)Fighter					(Str)<br>17)Fighter	WS-Katana<br>18)Fighter	Great Cleave<br>19)Fighter	ITWF<br>20)Fighter					(Str)<br>21)Fighter	EWF-Katana, EWS-Katana<br>22)WM<br>23)WM<br>24)WM		Great Strength			(Str)<br>25)WM<br>26)WM<br>27)WM		Great Strength II, Overwhelming Critical-Katana<br>28)WM						(Str)<br>29)WM<br>30)WM		Great Strength III, Epic Prowess<br>31)WM<br>32)WM						(Str)<br>33)WM		Great Strength IV, Armor Skin<br>34)Monk<br>35)Monk<br>36)Monk	Great Strength V		(Str)<br>37)Monk<br>38)Monk<br>39)Monk	Great Strength VI<br>40)WM						(Str)<br><br>AB		49/44/39/34 (Mundane Katana)<br>Dual Wield AB	45/40/35/30 45/40 (Mundane Katana)<br>Damage Main	1-10+17 15-20x3 +2d6 OC<br>Damage Off	1-10+11 15-20x3 +2d6 OC<br>BAB		30<br>Base AC	23<br>HP		468(Max)<br><br>Saves:<br>Fort		22 (+4 vs Spells)<br>Reflex		21 (+4 vs Spells)<br>Will		15 (+4 vs Spells)<br><br>Dicipline	43<br>Heal		43<br>Spellcraft	20<br>Spot		43<br>Tumble		40<br>10 extra skill points<br><br>Hope you guys liked the story.  I thought a little background would go a long way to make a build more fun to play.  What can I say - When I first bought the HotU expansion, I played a dual wielding katana master and mauled everything. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">           I've always wanted to make one.  I saw a lot of the same class combos on search, but none like this one.<br><br>For a non dex/cleric build, he has a fabulous AB.  I miss toughness, but if you wanted to sacrifice 2 grt str feats, I'd say go for toughness and blindfight.  This is a mega feat build and monk at the end provides Imp Knockdown, evasion, tumble, bit of speed, and +2 on will saves.<br><br>I don;t make builds with Dev crit since it's disabled on most PWs but Overwhelming crit is good stuff.  Grab some keen katanas and at 13-20 threat range, you will be shreading enemies.  Even against crit immunes, you still do good damage.  Swap in a shield for those boss monsters.<br><br>Enjoy!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 09/23/05 20:13</span></i></p>

Loved the story... haven't built the build yet but it looks as if it can do 2 things... deal damage and look good doing it. The knockdown effect would be nice in an even fight (say against a dragon) let them think they can go toe to toe then, WHAM, beatdown mode. Nice effect to use as a kill shot, Katana users have to kill in style. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> ... but with all the feats I'm sure we could fit Toughness in somewhere.

You could take monk levels much earlier. Spread them out somewhat. A monk gets Cleave you know. That would free you toughness right there. As for Overwhelming crit, its average 10 extra damage for this guy. 3d6=3-18. Average 10,5. Blind fight will get you further. I think in a build with monk, Drop power attack and overwhelming if you don't want Dev crit.<br>Thats my opinion. It is surely a really solid guy. <br><br>About monk levels pre epic. You free up cleave. Get an AC boost earlier. Evasion earlier! And better saves. Monk lvl 2 has +3 on all saves! Consider it at least. The pro's far outweigh the Cons, since the only one I can see is the loss of 1 BAB, and your AB is gooood anyway.<br><br>Nice.

Nice story and nice build. I have a similar build (Monk 12/Fighter 6/WM 22)<br><br>One thought I had is that I believe WM 20 doesn't give you any advantage over WM 19. So, if you wanted to take advantage of the Monk abilities earlier, you could take your six monk levels at 21-26, then take a 7th level late in life to maximize Tumble. This would give you Improved Knockdown at level 26 instead of 39.<br><br>As Grim just pointed out, you could take Monk pre-epic, but this impacts your AB.<br><br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br><i>This space for rent</i>
