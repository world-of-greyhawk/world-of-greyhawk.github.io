The purpose of this build is to be able to score the maximum physical damage per round without the smite tricks.<br><br>After I made this build (a few weeks ago) I found one that talks about this one, some called it Spanish inquisition (it's funny because I'm spanish). I didn't base this on it but looks very close, I decided to post it anyway because its slighly different.<br><br>He is fairly weak and some of the damage should be sacrificed for other features to make it really good (this is just an experiment to be worked on), but the purpose was this being able to deal the max damage possible each round and I think he does it really well.<br><br>Its something I had fun thinking on, not nothing I would play on a RP persistant world.<br><br>IMPORTANT:<br> - I took advantage on the so called monk attack bug (Im not sure if it is really a bug).<br> - I designed this build for a world where haste items aren't any hard to find, it means I do my calculations on a hasted character with flurry of blows on.<br><br>Human, Lawful Evil<br>(Lawful for monk, evil for blackguard, human for the extra feat, skill points and avoid multiclass xp penalty)<br><br>Starting stats:<br><br>Str: 12  (you dont need more, that str will make you be able to carry a bit of loot)<br>Dex: 18 (for AC, epic dodge and help ab with finesse)<br>Con: 12 (we would wish a bit of HP)<br>Wis: 8   (we wont get any penalty but in saves for this)<br>Int: 14  (For improved knockdown and better skills)<br>Cha: 8  (we lose some blackguard bonus, but this can be archieved with cha boosting items)<br><br>This is the level sequence:<br><br>DT: DISABLE TRAPS<br>HI: HIDE<br>LI:

during the BG levels), spellcraft(Cross class), use magical device and you still will be able to max a few more (like unlock, untrap, search, listen, spot...).<br><br>Your AB will

I have a build posted a little way down the forum that manages a potential 2180/round, made along similar lines.

Just one minor problem:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;21 Rogue: Improved Evasion, Defensive Roll</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Improved Evasion and Defensive Roll can only be taken as rogue bonus feats.  Neither one appears on the general feat list even when taking a rogue level, and even in epic levels.  Thus, it's impossible to take both on the same level.  You'd have to switch it for one of the improved sneak attacks that you take as a rogue bonus feat, since you can take ISA as a regular feat at level 21 (you just reach the 8d6 sneak prerequisite pre-epic).<br><br>Honestly...your AB is really low.  The fact that you can use true strike really isn't a fair comment.  You'd have to cast true strike every round of battle just to hit something, and if your build is that dependent on using a certain scroll over and over, then that's a problem.  I think you would be better off dropping some of your ISA for things like Epic Weapon Focus, Epic Prowess, and Great Dex to boost your AB a little.  Sure, that goes against the idea of "maximum sneak damage possible in an ideal world", but all the sneak damage in the world doesn't really matter if you can't hit anything except on a 20.<br><br>Steve

Thanks for the comments, about the AB, you are VERY right, I already noted it, it isn't really great:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;He is fairly weak and some of the damage should be sacrificed for other features to make it really good (this is just an experiment to be worked on)</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/04/05 20:43:00 (GMT) -- Stravinsky00<br><br>Just one minor problem:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;21 Rogue: Improved Evasion, Defensive Roll</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Improved Evasion and Defensive Roll can only be taken as rogue bonus feats.
