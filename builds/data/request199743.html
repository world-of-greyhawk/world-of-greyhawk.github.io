Hey, how's it going?<br><br>So I've played through the OC's already, but as I've done so it has always been with the benefit and use of the henchmen allowed.<br><br>I was wondering if anyone has solo'ed any/all of the OC's, and what character types they may have used to complete it/them.<br><br>A specific build would be ideal, but a general sense of what classes/skills/feats/etc. would be very helpful.<br><br>Most of my characters tend to be of a melee nature.  I tend to favor monks (fave is monk/sorc/rdd) and bards (b/f/rdd).  <br><br>Thanks in advance.<br>_________________<br>Life's short and hard, like a body-building Elf.

When you play the OC's you get so good equipment that you can solo any class and almost any build, unless it's completely crippled.<br><br>I had no serious problems completing the NWN OC soloing a sorc that NEVER used any henchmen, familiar or summons. I had to run a lot in the lower levels though.<br><br>Once I played a Rogue/Fighter that specialized in unarmed combat, going with what equipment I could find or buy. The damage output was weak compared to any weapon, but I had no problems completing the OC.<br><br>On the other hand, completing the OC's WITHOUT using all the good equipment - that's a challenge for a character builder.<br><br>If I had to complete the game, soloing a melee character with mundane equipment, I'd probably try a cleric.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 06/15/05 13:40</span></i></p>

I went clericX/Fighter4 my first run through.  Was pretty much a breeze; died once or twice early on while I was trying to get the hang of the game.
