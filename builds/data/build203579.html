Paladin 8 does get you level 2 spells, if you have equipment that will get your wisdom to level 4.  Your innate wisdom of 12 will permit the casting of spells even though you get *zero* without the ability bonus.  Your saves are sick as it is, but eagle's splendor will increase them and will add a little to your divine wrath and a little bump to your lay on hands abilities.

And it's playable 1-40, PvM until I figure out if it can PvP (it is designed to PvP but you never know -- math without monks, and all).

thanks, Mith, good points as always.  <br><br>I really like the point about CoT pre-epic.  I hadn't considered that but that would take an already high fortitude save and make it higher.  <br><br>hmmmmm.<br><br>S: 14 to 30<br>D: 13<br>C: 12<br>W: 11 to 12<br>I: 14<br>CH: 14<br><br>1 Paladin1 Feat: WF: Greatsword<br>2 Paladin2 <br>3 Paladin3 Feat: Dodge <br>4 Paladin4 Ability: Strength (15)<br>5 Paladin5<br>6 Paladin6 Feat: Power Attack<br>7 Paladin7 <br>8 CoT1 Ability: Strength (16)<br>9 CoT2 Feat: Cleave, CoTFeat: Expertise <br>10 CoT3 <br>11 CoT4 Feat: Mobility<br>12 CoT5 Feat: Improved Critical (Greatsword); Ability: Strength (17)<br>13 CoT6 CFeat: Spring Attack<br>14 CoT7<br>15 Cot8 Feat: Whirlwind Attack, CFeat: Great Cleave<br>16 Weapon Master1 Ability: Strength (18)<br>17 Weapon Master2<br>18 Weapon Master3 Feat: Cleave<br>19 Weapon Master4<br>20 Weapon Master5 Ability: Strength (19)<br>21 Weapon Master6 Feat: Great Strength I (20),  <br>22 WeaponMaster7 <br>23 Cot9 <br>24 CoT10 Feat: Great Strength II (21) CFeat: Epic Prowess; Ability: Strength (22)<br>25 WeaponMaster 8 <br>26 Weapon Master9 <br>27 Weapon Master10 Feat: Great Strength III (23)<br>28 Weapon Master11 Feat: Overwhelming Critical; Ability: Strength (24) <br>29 Weapon Master12<br>30 Weapon Master13 Feat: Epic Weapon Focus (Greatsword)31 CoT11 <br>32 CoT12 CFeat: Devastating Critical (Greatsword); Ability: Strength (25)<br>33 CoT13 Feat: Great Strength IV (26)<br>34 Paladin8<br>35 Paladin9 <br>36 Weapon Master14 <br>37 Weapon Master15<br>38 Weapon Master16 Feat: Great Strength V (27) Ability: Strength (28)<br>39 CoT14 CFeat: Great Wisdom (12); Feat: Great Strength VI (29) <br>40 Paladin10 Ability: Strength (30)<br><br>I will have to go build it to see where the saves come out (better, no doubt, except for one less in will) but the AB should remain the same.
