You used 3 epic feats to ONLY use shields.. dont you think it would be better if you got Heavy Armor Prof. too?<br>_________________<br>They were all dead. The final gunshot was an exclamation mark to everything that had led up to this point. I released my finger from the trigger. And then it was all over. The storm seemed to lose its frenzy.

Cool. Surprised there are no other builds with this split. However, lore is not really necessary. Identify spell will ID most things until higher levels, where the shopkeeper ID price wont hurt too much. <br><br>With 162 HP, you're not going to last more than a round or two against a high strength build. Definitely a good choice to drop some dexterity and maybe some charisma for constitution, IMHO. Otherwise you could change race to gnome (the race is so neglected!) for a nice constitution bonus, and one AC point (small stature). You'd lose 43 skillpoints, but it's possible to drop some of your concentration, maybe. Your spell penetration isn't realistically going to get through a decent SR, so dropping a little spellcraft and the penetration feats could be feasible.<br><br>Replace lore with discipline, it can be taken on your monk level, otherwise, with that horrible 8 strength your going to be KD fodder. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">  <br><br>Only other change I would suggest is getting paladin rather than monk. You would lose 4 AC from tumble (but you keep 4 from crossclassing it) but if you took 3 paladin levels you could get divine might, providing a nice hefty boost to AC with your high charisma. Going this route would mean a further deduction to your sorceror levels, but your spell DCs won't be very good anyway <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  . It provides all 4 feats for armour and shields in one level, and some AC (even if some is temporary).<br><br>Hope these points help rush it up a little.<br>Kurth<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By K U R T H on 11/30/06 17:52</span></i></p>

Is monk worth it just for tumble and evasion? Not so sure. you'd be better off AC-wise with heavy armor and only 4 points into tumble. Paladin if possible, or fighter, Cleric. Even rogue for light armour <b>AND</b> tumble.<br><br>Even though lore very often is a not-so-useful skill, discipline in this build without ESF: Discipline is just as useless and won't help you anything. The build is powerful though, a high-level caster with PM-levels is just that. Add some armour and you're good to go.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

This looks like a really interesting build. Would it turn it, too much, into the Exalted Sorceress if you dumped the Monk level for a Paladin level? I know you would have to make an alignment shift but it seems like it would buff your saves considerably, and immunity to Disease would go nicely with the PM immunities. Just a thought.<br><br>Cool build.
