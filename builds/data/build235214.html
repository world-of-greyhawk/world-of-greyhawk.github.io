I pretty much always end up playing with buffed cleric warriors.  Here's my first submitted one - I didn't see any CoT / Cl / WM combos out there, so I hope it's unique.<br><br>This character makes use of the scythe's high critical modifier combined with the weapon master's crit enhancing abilities and the clerics very buffable AB and damage to generate horrific criticals without the use of Devastating Critical (17-20 critical range without Keen weapon, max of 181-216 critical damage using only buffs of 20 rounds duration or more).  Champion of Torm is used pre-epic to grab the necessary feats to reach WM and to provide a boost to the saves (both through inherent multiple good saves and Sacred Shield).  CL 23 isn't the gold standard of 26 for undispellability, but it's pretty close, providing nice SR and durable buffs.  War Domain provides good spells and extra ooomph with it's domain power, while the Trickery domain provides Improved Invisibility and temporary but substantial thief skills.  He's not crazy powerful in a single category, but he's got a variety of tricks up his sleeves.  <br><br>Well Rounded Battle Cleric - Cleric 23 / CoT 10 / WM 7 <br>Race: Human <br>Alignment: Any non-evil<br><br>PvM, Possibly PvP, Playable 1-40<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str	14<br>Dex	14<br>Con	12<br>Wis	15<br>Int	14<br>Cha	8<br><br>Leveling<br>1 Cleric 1 - Power Attack, Cleave<br>2 Cleric 2<br>3 Cleric 3 - Exotic Weapon Proficiency<br>4 Cleric 4 - Str + 1 (15)<br>5 Cleric 5<br>6 Cleric 6 - Weapon Focus: Scythe<br>7 Cleric 7<br>8 Cleric 8 - Str + 1 (16)<br>9 Cleric 9 - Extend Spell<br>10 Cleric 10<br>11 Champion of Torm 1<br>12 CoT 2 - Empower Spell, Improved Critical: Scythe, Str + 1 (17)<br>13 CoT 3<br>14 CoT 4 - Dodge<br>15 CoT 5 - Mobility<br>16 CoT 6 - Spring Attack, Str + 1 (18)<br>17 CoT 7 <br>18 CoT 8 - Expertise, Whirlwind<br>19 Weapon Master 1 - Weapon of Choice: Scythe<br>20 WM 2 - Str + 1 (19)<br>21 WM 3 - Epic Weapon Focus: Scythe<br>22 WM 4 <br>23 WM 5 <br>24 WM 6 - Blind Fighting or Silent Spell*, Wis + 1 (16)<br>25 WM 7 <br>26 Cleric 11<br>27 Cleric 12 - Great Wisdom (17)<br>28 Cleric 13 - Wis + 1 (18)<br>29 Cleric 14 <br>30 Cleric 15 - Great Strength I (20)<br>31 Cleric 16 <br>32 Cleric 17 - Wis + 1 (19)<br>33 Cleric 18 - Great Strength II (21)<br>34 Cleric 19 <br>35 Cleric 20 <br>36 Cleric 21 - Strength + 1 (22), Great Strength III (23)<br>37 Cleric 22 <br>38 CoT 9<br>39 Cleric 23 - Great Strength IV (24), Armor Skin<br>40 CoT 10 - Epic Prowess, Str + 1 (25)<br><br>* Blind Fighting may or may not be necessary, given true sight and invisibility purge - Silent Spell allows for much better use of high level slots and is therefore recommended.<br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 	25<br>Dex	14<br>Con	12<br>Wis	19<br>Int	14<br>Cha	8<br><br>Skills<br>Concentration 42<br>Discipline 43<br>Spellcraft 40<br>Tumble 20<br>Intimidate 4<br>Disable Trap &amp; Open Lock 6<br>Search 8<br>Pick Pockets 1  <br><br><br>A word on buffs - the included buffs below have a minimum duration of 20 rounds.

Silent spell can be quite useful if you happen to get hit by Silence - without it, you won't be able to cast anything with a verbal component (most spells). And, like Still, it also allows you to cast a useful spell as 1 level higher, allowing more castings per day (for example, it may be worthwhile to cast Harm silenced, since you can now use 7th level slots as well as 6th for it).<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 03/28/06 18:19</span></i></p>

Would you rather have 5 storms of vengeance or 5 mass heals for your ninth (particularly with 19 wis)?

Erm, more precisely, there's a +20 cap for magical bonuses to AB, be it from weapons (e.g. Greater Magic Weapon) or from buffing spells (e.g. Divine Power). However, bonuses to AB from ability score buffs (e.g. Bull's Strength) do not count towards the cap. Thus, your effective max AB is your unbuffed AB +26 (this is because you can buff your ability scores +12 max, i.e. +6 on the modifier). I hope that's clear enough <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif"><br>_________________<br>"Ever notice how wizards think all life in the Realms dances on their hands and lasts from day to day only because they work constantly to keep us all alive?

I missed the Power Attack bonuses for his damage, so his damage range goes to 46-60 base damage, 186 - 236 critical damage if you use PA.  It's a high variable because it accounts for variable Empowered Bull's Strength options.  He's still about a 10th as damaging as the Damage Adept, but he can keep it up a lot longer and is a lot more versatile.  <br><br>In a pure PvP environment you should drop Cleave and grab either Improved Power Attack or ESF: Discipline, depending on the ACs and general proclivities of your environment.  You'd have to shift Blind-Fight down to pre-epic for ESF.
