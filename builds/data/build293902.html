Rogue/FTR/CoT is a great class combo, we all know it. This time I wanted to have a versatile build, with high defenses, which performs equally well both ranged and melee, with good saves and which is lotsa fun to play. This build is faring fairly well in one hard MP environment, I'm very satisfied with it.<br><br>Halfling was chosen because of +2/+3 AB (+2 Dex, +1 small size, +1 throwing weapons) and +1 AC (+2 Dex, +1 small size, -1 medium shield). As said, I wanted the guy to have a presence in both ranged and melee, therefore I had him specialize in both sling and shortsword. <br><br>I didn't go for dual wielding cause I wanted the saves and the HPs (and an extra crit range on the sling) and I focused on the defensive side of the build. But you can get it in, if you want to (go with daggers as your melee weapon of choice then). <br><br>Similarly, I didn't get KD/IKD because I pictured this as a ranged fighter which can melee pretty well although the latter is not his specialty. There's space for the feats if you drop, for example, the save boosters.<br><br>CoT lvls pump the saves in the good to (unnecessarily) amazing (Ref) region. <br><br>ED is basically a must in my Dex builds and it is achieved at 24th lvl. You'll have to move it up at 27th lvl once 1.69 comes out. That said, you can also go with a FTR 5/Cot 7/Rogue 8 preepic and get +1 AB at the cost of -1 to all saves (it will force ED at 27th lvl btw). <br><br>Crippling Strike at 40th lvl is just the icing on the cake. <br><br>Skill selection is tweakable, of course, the one presented here is thought with WoG (and my own playstyle) in mind (check my sig).<br><br><br><br><b>******************************</b><br><br><br><br><b>Holy Slinger of Doom - Rogue(16), Fighter(10), Champion of Torm(14)</b> <br>Halfling, any non evil alignment <br><i>PvM, playable 1-40</i><br><br><br><br><b>ABILITIES (ending)</b> <br>STR: 12 <br>DEX: 18 (34) <br>CON: 14 <br>WIS: 10 <br>INT: 14 <br>CHA: 8 <br><br><br><b>BASIC STATS </b><br>Hitpoints: 456 <br>Skillpoints: 286 <br><br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 34/26/43 <br>Saving Throw bonuses: Traps: +3, Fear: +2, Improved Evasion <br><br>BAB: 27 <br>AB: 44 (melee), 45 (ranged) <br><br>AC (naked/shield only): 33/35 <br><br><br><b>SKILLS </b><br>Craft Trap 8(10), Disable Trap 43(47), Hide 43(55), Move Silently 41(55), Open Lock 23(35), Search 21(23), Set Trap 31(45), Tumble 40(52), UMD 36(35), no points leftover <br><br><br><b>LEVELING GUIDE </b><br>01: Rogue(1): Point Blank Shot <br>02: Rogue(2): {Evasion} <br>03: Fighter(1): Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus: Sling <br>04: Fighter(2): DEX+1, Weapon Focus: Shortsword, (DEX=19) <br>05: Fighter(3) <br>06: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Shortsword, Weapon Specialization: Sling <br>07: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I} <br>08: Rogue(4): DEX+1, (DEX=20) <br>09: Champion of Torm(1): Rapid Shot <br>10: Champion of Torm(2): Blind Fight <br>11: Champion of Torm(3): {Smite Evil} <br>12: Champion of Torm(4): DEX+1, Iron Will, Called Shot, (DEX=21) <br>13: Rogue(5) <br>14: Champion of Torm(5) <br>15: Champion of Torm(6): Great Fortitude, Improved Critical: Sling <br>16: Rogue(6): DEX+1, (DEX=22) <br>17: Rogue(7) <br>18: Rogue(8): Toughness <br>19: Rogue(9) <br>20: Rogue(10): DEX+1, Improved Evasion, (DEX=23) <br>21: Rogue(11): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=24) <br>22: Champion of Torm(7) <br>23: Rogue(12) <br>24: Rogue(13): DEX+1, Epic Dodge, Defensive Roll, (DEX=25) <br>25: Champion of Torm(8): Epic Weapon Focus: Sling <br>26: Champion of Torm(9) <br>27: Champion of Torm(10): Great Dexterity II, Epic Weapon Specialization: Sling, (DEX=26) <br>28: Rogue(14): DEX+1, (DEX=27) <br>29: Fighter(5) <br>30: Fighter(6): Great Dexterity III, Epic Weapon Focus: Shortsword, (DEX=28) <br>31: Fighter(7) <br>32: Fighter(8): DEX+1, Epic Weapon Specialization: Shortsword, (DEX=29) <br>33: Rogue(15): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=30) <br>34: Fighter(9) <br>35: Fighter(10): Armor Skin <br>36: Champion of Torm(11): DEX+1, Great Dexterity V, (DEX=32) <br>37: Champion of Torm(12) <br>38: Champion of Torm(13) <br>39: Champion of Torm(14): Great Dexterity VI, Epic Prowess, (DEX=33) <br>40: Rogue(16): DEX+1, Crippling Strike, (DEX=34) <br><br><br><br><b>******************************</b><br><br><br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><b>•</b>Good ranged <i>and</i> melee AB<br><b>•</b>Good AC, doesn't give it up to go ranged<br><b>•</b>WS/EWS in both sling and shortsword, they greatly help dmg output in a dexer<br><b>•</b>Epic Dodge early on<br><b>•</b>Good saves<br><b>•</b>UMD<br><b>•</b>Epic trap skills<br><b>•</b>Good HPs for an epic dodger.<br><b>•</b>8d6 SA <br><b>•</b>Crippling Strike (late)<br><br><br><i>Weaknesses</i><br><b>•</b>Not enough skillpoints to get all the skills I wanted<br><b>•</b>No dual wielding, but you can get it if you want to<br><b>•</b>Dmg output vs crit immunes can still be an issue... use alternative tactics (man, ain't you a rogue? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   )<br><b>•</b>The will save could be better <br><b>•</b>No CHA for CoT special abilities<br><b>•</b>No KD/IKD feats (drop some save boosters if you want them)<br><br><br><br><b>******************************</b><br><br><br> <br>Some similar builds in the search engine:<br> <br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "206501", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Incredible Fighting Rogue Of War (FTR 6 / COT 14 / Rogue 20)</a><br>-- grizzled_dwarflord<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "213875", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Deaths Rival (Rogue 24 / FTR 6 / COT 10)</a><br>-- grizzled_dwarflord<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "179627", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Martial Rogue (Rogue 20 / FTR 10 / COT 10)</a><br>-- xitooner <br><br><br>Feedback and constructive criticism is, as usual, greatly appreciated.<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?

Aye ,but  he got no self buffs,so even with max dex bonus he still has to get magic ab bonus of items and teambuffs,unless its uber high magic environment.. I.e. With max dex +5weap and bless aid pot ab is 57,58.now thats low

In my usual numbers, less than 40 is low AB, 45 is good AB, you will hit often with that much, and more than 50 is just powerful, but I haven't seen any unbuffed AB over 50 that doesn't uses Red Dragon Disciple, Weapon Master or Arcane Archer, the regular classes just won't reach it.<br><br>As for buffs, there are lots of builds that can't use buffs because its classes don't give buffs, if we were so strict then all the builds lose against a Cleric or a Sorcerer, but you missed this important thing I'll quote below:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;PvM, playable 1-40</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>So sure, he's not a PvP machine and he'll get owned against your uber builds but that's just not the point all the time.<br><br>If you think that he needs a high magical environment to have high AB then the enemies will also have high ACs there.

A little late to the party (so sue me, I've been away), but I like this build. As for the AB issue, even though it's been addressed, I'll add my two cents as well. A raw 44 AB is damned good for a character that can't self buff. As others have pointed out, the only way you're going to get it much higher and still retain a character that's actually playable from level 1 is to use RDD, WM, and/or AA. Or build yourself a Cleric.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I have been dealing with similar players on other forums.  The thing to do would be to sit down and take a character with 16 rogue lvls (3/4 ab progression) and try to get higher than 44!  it is hard to do.  This is EPIC ab, whether you see it or not.  Its just that these guys are too modest to toot their own horns.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->
