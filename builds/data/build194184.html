Still a great build, but one problem with your strategy.  Magic Weapon/Greater Magic Weapon only work on melee weapons.  If you attempt to use it on a bow or on a creature weilding a bow, it doesn't work, and you get the following message:<br><br>*Spell Failed - target must be a melee weapon or creature with a melee weapon equipped*<br><br>Steve

As for spell choice, you should probably pick up Bull's Strength too.  It can give you a little bit more damage with a Mighty bow.<br><br>Steve

Well technically you need dodge for shadowdancer if memory serves me correctly, so in essense you do need dodge in this build. A very nice revamp of the original. Like stated though lose magic weapon spells. To my knowledge it still wouldn't stack with your AA bonus even if it did work on ranged weapons.

How would this build be affected if you replaced your last bard lvl (40) and took it at 20 instead.  Seems to me that you'd get one more BAB, and a bit more playability during your level ups.  But I don't know how this would affect the feat selection later on.  Having a higher UMD earlier might be usefull for leveling up.

He's currently taking his 3rd SD level at level 20, which also gives him +1 BAB just like the bard level would.  He'd have the same BAB regardless of what class he took at level 20.  He also would not be able to pump his UMD if he did that as you suggest.  This build gets very few skill points due to its INT 10.  The only reason he was able to get UMD that high was because he put the bard level at the end after saving a few points throughout his epic levels.  He uses up every skill point each level all the way up to level 20.  A bard level would give him 4 points only, meaning his UMD would be 9 lower than it ends up being his way.  Plus, the level of SD there allows him to boost tumble to the next highest point at that level, raising his AC by 1.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 06/20/05 17:49</span></i></p>
