Hi.  I've been working on a bard/x/rdd.  Let me just say what I need and maybe someone can help.<br><br>The build must have lasting impression, 4 base attacks, ability to cast extended duration spells at all times(read:wearing robes or cloth), curse song, strength based attack, no xp penalty, ability to cast lvl 4 bard spells.  There are some conflicts there like being strngth based and wearing no armor.  I want to be able to cast.  Bards can't get auto still spell so only way I figured was to wear no armor.  Another thing I was thinking about was uncanny dodge... if only I could take bard and dwarven defender...<br><br>There are some things to keep in mind.  I will not be changing alignment, I won't use dev crit, and won't take an xp penalty.<br><br>Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

26bard/10 rdd/4barb would proberly work<br><br>you can be strength based and wear armour if you don't mind having to take your amour of to buff up.<br><br>Another way is low arcana spell failer armour <br><br>Also if you can get it armor with reduced spell failer it is very good . <br><br>off course even with quite a low dex and no armour you +4 ac from rdd and your tumble bonus plus improved invisablity and bard song. so dev criticaling is not an imposiblity...

you could try blackguard.  the chra modifier to your saves will help.  plus you can have the stackable bulls.  and going for divine shield could help the ac.  and the little bit of sneak couldnt hurt.  the minus to this vs a ftr is the # of feats and the requirements.  And the minus to this vs the barb is mostly the hps as you prob wont be able to get enough lvls of barb to make rage effective.  but with 2 prestiege classes you wont have to worry about exp penalty(that much), and can try different races and subraces.  you would be the lead singer in a goth metal band.  any weopon will do.  but  a 2 handed for str bonus would be nice, but you would prob want a shield.

I agree with Draco Spirit. Barbarian is the only class you can take that will give you both 4 attacks a round and uncanny dodge. <br><br>To wear robes you need to be dex based. It is possible to be dex based and still get dev crit. If you start with 16 str, you only need 1 strength stat raise (after RDD bonuses) to get to 25 str. So you can pump all your other stat raises into dex.<br><br>Human or half-elf will not get an xp penalty.
