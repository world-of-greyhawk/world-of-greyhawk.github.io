Last I checked, there were no builds with this class <br>combination. I thought I'd add one. I'm pretty happy <br>with the build. AC is really low. Wish the AB were a <br>little higher. I chose the Great Axe for weapon and<br>Panther for Animal Companion.

Dwarven STR based Ranger with Bane of Enemies and EDR III, I just have to like any such build.<br><br>I'd probably change initial DEX for WIS... but that's because I like to buff Freedom, it won't make a really big difference.<br><br>Now then, I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure you can't take Epic Weapon Specialization as bonus CoT feat, it surely can be taken with CoT, but only on regular feats, since EWS is not in CoT's bonus feat list.

EWS is available on all weapons, except Dwarven Waraxe as a bonus CoT feat, worth noting really.<br><br>Nice build overall, although I would also opt for a base of 14 in WIS, for the 4th level spells and the 1 point to Will save.<br><br>Not really sure how much this build benefits from Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes and Great Fortitude. I would be tempted to sub them out for something else, perhaps Power Attack and Cleave or Expertise/ Imp Expertise.<br><br>Another approach could see you going Ranger 20, CoT 10, Fighter 10, which could net you a higher AB, Dev Crit, EDR III, similar saves (Fort remains the same) and slightly more HP (40) with a final CON of 22. You would lose Bane of Enemies mind you and a few Favored Enemies too.<br><br>From a personal point of view, with such a low AC as this build has I would be sorely tempted to take a medium weapon instead so that the option to sword and board is available.

Thanks for the replies Thax and Samphus.<br>As Samphus stated you can take EWS as a COT bonus feat.<br>With the AC so low, I had also thought about going medium size weapon and shield. I end up taking the save booster feats on a lot of my builds. But, they definately arent necassary. I had thought about going to 14 WIS, I just hardly ever use the 4th level Ranger spells though and I would give up another point of AC by dropping DEX. I dont think I could live with a Ranger build giving up Bane of Enemies. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By galelabriel on 03/22/07 11:12</span></i></p>

I would be temptedt to start with<br><br>STR 14<br>DEX 12<br>CON 17<br>WIS 14<br>INT 14<br>CHA 6<br><br>Then go with lighter armour and dual-wield. That will increase your damage output quite a lot. Your AC might suffer a bit, but a little DEX gear and a studded or normal leather should take care of most of it, and your damage will easily compensate. Dropping 2 INT for DEX might be good too. I personally like 16 CON and 14 DEX compared to the above, but I am not sure how much trouble that point in CON might cause. Really cool build.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Good suggestions Grim. I like the idea of dual wielding with a BoE Ranger build better than how it is now. When I get a chance, I will fool around with the build a little and see how it goes. The higher damage potential should greatly outweigh any difference in AC...which might not be much of a difference at all when raising DEX and going with lighter armor. Thanks.

You will still have the opportunity to put on Plate+Tower should the situation call for it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again
