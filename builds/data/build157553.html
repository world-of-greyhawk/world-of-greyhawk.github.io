The Sardonic Savior has received a complete training in the arts of annoyance. With 496 HP, SR 22, Improved Evasion, and exceptional saves, he's going to be difficult to overcome either by spell or sword. <br><br>Did I also mention he has a Taunt check of 70 before buffs? His frustrated opponents leave themselves open to advanced techniques like Improved Knockdown and Improved Power Attack, both of which will hurt. Badly. Especially when combined with Divine Wrath, Divine Might, Divine Favor, Deafening Clang, Bull's Strength, and Holy Sword.<br><br>Without further ado:<br>The Sardonic Savior<br>Human LG Paladin 18 / Monk 12 / Champion of Torm 10<br><br>Attributes:<br>STR: 14<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 14<br>INT: 12<br>WIS: 12<br>CHR: 15 -&gt; 30<br><br>Level/Feat/Attribute Progression:<br>1 Monk: Power Attack, Strong Soul	<br>2 Monk			<br>3 Paladin: Weapon Focus: Longsword	<br>4 Paladin: Charisma +1<br>5 Paladin			<br>6 Paladin: Divine Might	<br>7 Monk			<br>8 Paladin: Charisma +1<br>9 Paladin: Divine Shield	<br>10 Paladin			<br>11 Paladin			<br>12 Monk: Great Cleave, Charisma +1<br>13 Champion of Torm			<br>14 Champion of Torm: Improved Critical: Longsword*	<br>15 Champion of Torm: Skill Focus: Taunt	<br>16 Champion of Torm: Improved Power Attack*, Charisma +1<br>17 Monk			<br>18 Paladin: Toughness	<br>19 Champion of Torm			<br>20 Monk: Charisma +1<br>21 Paladin: Epic Skill Focus: Taunt	<br>22 Monk			<br>23 Champion of Torm: EWF: Longsword*	<br>24 Champion of Torm: Great Charisma I, Charisma +1<br>25 Champion of Torm: Great Wisdom I*	<br>26 Champion of Torm			<br>27 Monk: Epic Reputation	<br>28 Monk: Charisma +1<br>29 Champion of Torm: Great Wisdom II*	<br>30 Paladin: Great Charisma II	<br>31 Paladin			<br>32 Monk: Charisma +1<br>33 Paladin: Great Charisma III	<br>34 Paladin			<br>35 Paladin			<br>36 Paladin: Great Charisma IV, Charisma +1<br>37 Monk			<br>38 Monk			<br>39 Paladin: Great Charisma V	<br>40 Paladin: Charisma +1<br><br>*Denotes Champion of Torm bonus feats<br><br>Skills: <br>Concentration 43<br>Discipline 43<br>Heal 17<br>Persuade 16<br>Taunt 43<br>Tumble 40<br><br>Saves (unbuffed):<br>Fortitude 43<br>Reflex 37<br>Will 37<br><br>Recommended Spells:<br>Level 1: Deafening Clang, Divine Favor x2, Protection from Alignment<br>Level 2: Aura of Glory, Bull's Strength, Eagle's Splendor<br>Level 3: Dispel Magic, Prayer<br>Level 4: Holy Sword<br><br>Character Analysis:<br><br>Attack Bonus (fully buffed, mundane longsword):<br>+28 (Base Attack Bonus)<br>+3 (Weapon Focus + Epic Weapon Focus)<br>+5 (Holy Sword)<br>+5 (Divine Favor)<br>+5 (Divine Wrath)<br>+2 (Base Strength modifier)<br>+1 (minimum for Bull's Strength)<br>+1 (Prayer)<br>---<br>+50/+45/+40/+35<br><br>Attack Damage (fully buffed, mundane longsword):<br>1d8 (base damage for a mundane longsword)<br>+13 (Divine Might w/Aura of Glory and Eagle's Splendor)<br>+10 (Improved Power Attack)<br>+5 (Divine Favor)<br>+5 (Divine Wrath)<br>+5 (Holy Sword)<br>+3 (Deafening Clang)<br>+2 (Base Strength modifier)<br>+1 (minimum for Bull's Strength)<br>+1 (Prayer)<br>---<br>1d8 + 45 damage<br><br>Armor Class (fully buffed, dressed in AC 0 robes)<br>10 (base armor class)<br>+13 (Divine Shield w/Aura of Glory and Eagle's Splendor)<br>+8 (Bonus for 40 ranks of Tumble)<br>+2 (Protection from Alignment)<br>+2 (AC bonus from Wisdom modifier)<br>+2 (Innate Monk AC bonus)<br>---<br>Armor Class: 37**<br><br>**You will probably be using the classic Full Plate/Tower Shield combination, so drop four from this figure if you want your AC in armor.<br><br>As for equipment, you're obviously going to want a nice, magic longsword along with some high quality heavy armor and a tower shield.

I've never played a Charisma-based Paladin. All my paladins (in OC) were brawny strenth-based. But this build looks intriguing. I imagine a charisma-based pally is played more like a spellcaster than a straightforward melee character.<br><br>How difficult is the leveling? Is he pretty constant throughout or does he only get powerful at high levels? I was thinking I needed to add a Paladin to my stable of characters on the PW I play on. But I also know it's disheartening to start a new character on a PW only to find at level 7 that you're still being kicked around by the rats in the sewers <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif"> <br><br>Kaliban.<br><br>PS - Your sig space is for rent? How much for "Nov. 3 vote Kerry-Edwards or continue funding Dick Cheney's Haliburton fund for another four years!"? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">

I too like this build, very much so. But ...there had to be one, i fail to see how you can cast 3rd and 4th lvl spells with only 12 wisdom, 13 and 14 is required for the last two spells, it may have been me that overlooked it somehow, if not i suggest taking int down to 10 loose some skillpoints and get the wis up to 14 and get the last two spell levels.<br><br>-Alis

He takes 2 Great Wisdom feats thus ending with 14 Wisdom.
