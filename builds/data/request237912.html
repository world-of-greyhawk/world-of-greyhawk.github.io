Feat starved like nothing else, it ain't that good IMO. I'd rather go Bard 14/RDD 10/FTR 6 or Bard 15/RDD 10/FTR 5, for example. What about Cleric 17/Bard 3/RDD 10 exploiting divine power? <br><br>There are lotsa possibilities, try to narrow down what kind of build you want.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Stand and fight, live by your heart<br>Always one more try, I'm not afraid to die<br>Stand and fight, say what you feel<br>Born with a Heart of Steel!

I always suggest not to ask for "best build", since there isn't an overall best character, and at the end you use what you like most and what you think it's best, there are always several possibilities and points of view.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;But then wouldnt Cleric/FTR/WM be better?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>That's a strong combination but it doesn't gets RDD, I don't understand.....<br><br>Now, give us information about our server, like, what are the enhancement levels? IMO AC much more favored with high magical items, and if they're low go with a Cleric and make enhancement +5 by yourself.
