Looks like a strong cleric with rogue skillset.<br><br>Your format is very difficult to read. All those numbers and brackets and parentheses and ellipses make my eyes cross...<br><br>It's usually recommended to post skill point assignments separately from class and feat selections. Especially if there are no real decisions (ie. boost Conc. and Spell. every cleric level) then there is no need to post skills points used/saved each level. Check out the sticky at the top of the page. It suggests something like:<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>(Boost Conc &amp; Disc on Cleric levels, boost Tumble &amp; UMD on Rogue levels)<br>1 Cleric 1 - Extend Spell, Combat Casting<br>2 Cleric 2 <br>3 Cleric 3 - Weapon Proficiency: Martial<br>4 Rogue 1 (Wis)<br>5 Cleric 4<br>6 Cleric 5 - Zen Archery<br>...</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br><i>I want my two dollars!</i>

taking elf would also mean less hp (-2 con) and one less feat so it would probably be great fortitude, however still an option <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif"> <br><br>spell penetration is needed for greater spell penetration and epic spell penetration but yes it becomes redundant cause they don't stack<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By jedi1 on 11/11/05 20:21</span></i></p>

take your monk earlier for easier leveling.  you can use the rogue level at 40 for a skill dump.<br><br>taking monk a 21, for example, won't cost you any bab.  You can use a single kama and cleric buffs and melee quite nicely.

Drop spell penetration feats, you can't crack an SR monk's protection and you can beat the toolset SR.<br><br>Drop combat casting/improved combat casting.  It won't help you at all - you won't be casting in melee combat and if you are, you need to either change to defensive casting mode or move.  You don't want to be using your bow in melee combat because even with point blank shot it still provokes AOOs so defensive cast won't hurt you.<br><br>Drop improved expertise, you can't have it active while defensive cast is on and you also can't use it with a bow equipped if I recall rightly.<br><br>Rearrange your feat choices then to pump great wisdom to the max for spell save DCs and extra spells per day.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

If it's just a healer, I question the need for so many Cleric levels if it's just for healing/buffing. Why don't you just take more levels of the other classes, like 6 monk/5 rogue/29 cleric? You'd get more playability by being able to top up discipline, tumble, etc throughout your levelling career.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

I am actually speechless!  Beside myself.  jed  i wasnt questioning why you took the single feat spell penetrate!  I have built a few toons in my day, and i do realize that you need spell pen for gr and epic!   <br><br>To me, taking penetrate with 38 lvls is truly a waste (as xylo points out). Thats 3 feats free.  Taking fortitude saves,  um why?  theres 2 more free feats!   Now, lookin at this: if you are using a bow, why do you need imp ccasting? combat casting, maybe, but icc?  Nope. icc is usful for melee combatants, and bowers  SHOULDNT be near anyone.  Theres another free feat.   The rest of your feat choice suggests a caster.  Are clerics the best use for this?<br><br>Taking elf means you can use the bow from 1! (u suggest short i was assumin long, sorry bout that).  It also makes your toon playable from lv 1 (which most of us here on epic builders applaud - 40 births are boring and rather dull).<br><br>Oh, and to answer about -2 con.. you are a cleric!  Endurance!  I have made many successful clerics with 10 and even 8 (when the stats r tight, like cleric/wm).  <br><br>Looking again on the build I am starting to wonder how you play it?   This is definitly a build that I would need to have a guide for to play (and i seem to only play clerics).   <br><br>I wonder about what jenna said.  Why go 38 cleric?  All it seems to get you is spell duration.  Once you get above 29 is there really a reason to go highr?   Is there another class that can use better?<br><br>some things to think on.  If you have the desire, maybe you can help us understand how you play this char.  I would be interested because it would be very different than what i usually play (strat wise).<br><br>peace

hmm as I know the dc calculation spell level + 1/2 caster level + wis modifier so 38 levels mean a better dc. As a healer I mean a divine caster, so it's not only for healing. <br><br>The reason why I took imp expertise and imp combat casting is that I use this build in 1/1 fights in PvP on a PW, I just put away my bow and try to get em with maximized Ice Storms, Implosion, Destruction and blade barrier (maximized it is 120 dmg). If I ran out of spells I switch to a bow and try to shoot em (I chose a bow rather than a melee weapon cause of more ab), but this option is rather for PvM as there are many spell immune monsters there. <br><br>Also 38 levels of cleric mean higher DC against Mord's and breaches. Both fortitude feats are useful against devvers, as my saves are a bit low without them. <br><br>As for penetration feats I'm not sure, it's that I just thought they're useful for a caster, maybe I'm wrong, you could drop em, so you can take all non-epic feats pre-epic and take two more great wisdom and then take elf as your race.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By jedi1 on 11/12/05 11:16</span></i></p>

Strange that none of you hsa commented this. Going Elf doesn't change your staring stats. True, you get -2 Con, but +2 DEX. Move 2 points from DEX then. The xp penalty is a no-problem to, it will only be for two levels. But you WILL lose 1 feat and 43 skillpoints. Improved expertise is good in this build IMO. What other two feats gain you 10 AC? Very nice to have if you want to cast gr sanctuary or imp invis to reposition or save your behind and run. As for playablity, he gives a few suggestions to improve it in his OP.
