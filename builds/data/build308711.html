Whiz, nice way around the assassin ISA thing!  I am assuming that the kobald has a sneak attack, or, according to another post, we are all left wondering the same thing about death attack.<br><br>The thing i wonder though, you take power attack; you have 30 base str on a dex build (am i mistaken that str is overridden in kobald form??  yet no devastating critical?

Animal empathy for quick snagging of a meat-shield.  Set traps for bunching up traps that are detectable only by rogues, for a surprise boat-load of damage and negative effects.<br><br>While a high spot or listen might be able to detect some stealth builds, most of the problems will come from invisible and sanctuary casters, because they won't lose track of him when he hides.  High UMD and Lore will hopefully improve this characters chance at getting a true-seeing item which can be merged into the shape (thus remaining a property immune to dispel).<br><br>The kobold does have a defense against his own trick.  Freedom of movement grants immunity to the death attack paralysis.  Though HiPS is almost impossible to detect,most level 40 builds that can detect invisibility also have true-seeing. As a shifter, there is a form (wyrmling shape) that can fly around as an observation post, using true-seeing to inform you of dangers and potential targets.

The problem is because neither druid nor shifter has either move silently as a class skill or weapon proficiency martial as a selectable feat you are delayed in take weapon proficiency martial until level 15 on an assassin level (13 levels of druid/shifter is needed to meet the move silently criterion.  <br><br><br>So that leaves level 18 for improved crit or weapon focus and the other is taken epic.  However, neither assassin, druid, nor shifter gets any of the weapon focus or weapon critical feats as an epic bonus feat.  Therefore, if you want dev crit. I would suggest taking away one ISA feat and two great strength feats for a strength of 28 which deals one less damage and has one less AB.<br><br>The earliest dev crit can come with this race, class, and starting ability score combination is level 36.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By WhiZard on 05/11/09 01:03</span></i></p>

So your going setting specific. I get that. You need less than half of the exixting animal empathy unless you are playing a mod with epic animals. I still like the build despite your approach.

Many comments assume starting at wisdom 12 and thus using shifter bonus feats for great wisdom instead of epic energy resistance.  While he is more concerned about getting a paralysis on the first go; my build is concerned with doing better against damage shields and raking out better damage, AB, and having a higher AC.  His analysis of a net loss of 2d6 sneak damage was in part due to the build he was comparing to, and in part due to him not taking into account the ISA feats. In fact, my build does more sneak damage than his.  I also did not take armor skin, as he would have anticipated, and still have a higher AC than his build.  I realize his concern for getting paralysis quickly, but HiPS builds are not completely ruined if they mess up.  Had this build not had HiPS, I would agree wholeheartedly that higher DC is better.<br><br>Further koolthursday did not mention (as this was not a feature then) the effect of brew potion and how access to third level druid spells greatly improved the self-buffing and removal of negative effects.  A quick protection from elements is able to resist a hellball after it has been cast.  Remove poison and disease have tremendous value.  Further the epic kobold feat improved evasion makes my reflex saves on a failure take just as much damage as his reflex saves on a success.
