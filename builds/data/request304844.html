What is the most powerful melee build?  I'm specifically looking for the following:<br>1) Good combo between damage and AC<br>2) Must be fully playable in OC/SOU/HoTU/Modules (i.e. no lame Bard skill dump at Level 37 unless you have several Bard skill dumps throughout the build)<br>3) Must be fully playable from lvl 1-40 PvM (again I'm going to use in modules)<br>4) Must be able to have many battles before resting so you can't use all buff spells and then rest after every single battle.<br><br>Thanks.

Hey man,<br><br>I'll repeat to you what I've been told ever since I joined this guild: The OCs (SOU, HOTU, etc...) are really easy, and pretty much anyone can go through them with any build. I can vouch for that myself, seeing as I got through them several times with builds that were far from optimized. The problem with no Bard (or whatever other class) skill dumps is that you can't max out tumble, and therefore you can't get the extra +8 AC that 40 ranks in it provide.<br><br>If you want a high AC melee build, you should probably use a class that can max out tumble at level 37.

Actually, I have never played on a PW myself. I don't have time for those. But I do have some other modules, with cool stories that are said to be harder than the OC's. If you want, I can refer you to them. The one I'm playing now is called The Aielund Saga, and I'm enjoying it very much so far. The biggest problem that you're going to have is that you'll need certain hakpaks to run the module, and it's a pain in the *** to get them to work, but now that I've done it I can help you too if need be.<br><br>Take it EZ!

There are a few different types of PW. A lot of them are "server vault" meaning your PC is stored on their server. Some start at level one, others give you some XP on your first login to get a few levels. Others are local vault where your PC is stored on your computer. The RP local vault servers seem to often cap levels at 30 or less and have gear restrictions like no immunities and such. Every PW has a different style, like RP where you  must RP all the time and leveling tends to be slow. Others are more hack and slash sometimes with optional RP. Leveling tends to be faster. Others are all about PvP. Every PW has a certain level of magic, from +1 or +2 items only to +20 uber gear. Certain modifications will often be made, like banning item properties (haste, true sight, and immunities are common) or banning/nerfing the more powerful spells or feats like Harm and Dev Crit. HiPS is occasionally nerfed. You can PM me if you want more info. The place I play is a server vault RP PW with fast leveling and +5 gear.

I just completed Aielund last night.  Very good mod.  I went through as a Ba/RDD/Monk with most of the levels in Monk; I finished at level 36 I think.  I was looking for other good mods as well.

Aielund is a great module. A bit weak at the end, but otherwise excellent. Runes of Blood is another really good one (not as long as Aielund, but still quite good). <br><br>For powerful melee builds, there are lots of possibilities. Ftr/Rogue/SD combos are very good, either dex-based (high AC and AB, but rely on sneak attack for damage), or str-based (lower AC, but huge damage potential with both str and sneak damage). These guys only need to rest to heal, no spells or one-time abilities to worry about.<br><br>Ftr/Bard/RDD is also very powerful. Tends to mature late (once they get RDD to 10 and Bard up into the teens), but has very high Str and damage output. AC is nothing special, and will need to rest to recharge buffing spells and Bard Song uses, but have enough to last several battles between rests.<br><br>Cleric and/or Paladin builds can also be very powerful. If str-based, they have good AB and damage even unbuffed, and with buffs it gets even better. Again, will need to rest to restore spells, but usually have enough to get through several battles without problems. Cha-based paladins can get into trouble if they rely too heavily on Smiting, only 3 uses per day (but they can be 3 1-hit kills even for most bosses...). Usually have better saves and defenses thanks to spells than most other fighter builds.<br><br>Monk/fighter builds can be very powerful in melee due to the large number of attacks per round (8-10, depending on whether or not they dual-wield). When str-based, that means outstanding damage output. Dex-based have very high AC, but not as good damage. Good saves, plus SR.<br><br>Last, there are the Ftr/WM builds. Very high AB, very high damage. They do tend to mature late, be a bit feat-starved, and have lower AC and poor saves.<br><br>No one is the "best", each have strengths and weaknesses, but all are quite playable 1-40.<br><br>TM

I thought Act IV started off well (I really liked the coup attempt, and the devious scheming of the various royalty), up to where you take off to the hall of planes. After that, I thought it became a bit Monty Haul-ish. One of the things I liked about the whole series is that it had lots of interesting magic items, with useful but not overpowering properties. The end bit was sort of a hunt for the super-duper ring, armor, shield, weapon, etc., so you can easily clobber the newest big bad guy, and got less interesting to me. YMMV. Overall, the series is still about my favorite module, so consider this a minor criticism of an overall excellent adventure. <br><br>Runes of blood is <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Modules.Detail&amp;id=4038" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>For that one, I went with a dex-based Rogue/Ftr/SD build, but it has some nice content for monks, and a paladin build would also do well. I wouldn't go with WM or RDD, you won't get high enough level to really take advantage of those. You start at level 3, and will end up in the mid-teens (similar to the OC). It is a mod that requires some thought - there are a number of enemies that you won't be able to defeat by just attacking them, but you can take them out fairly easily if you pay attention to the environment.<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 01/02/09 13:59</span></i></p>

TM,<br><br>Seeing as the best weapons in Aielund are +7 for a level 37 PC, and you probably carry +5 well into the endgame, I'd say calling it Monty Haul is rather unkind. There are some items I don't like (the epic warding ring). But mid magic standard is +1 per 5 levels. And that's almost exactly where you end up for gear. So I think that's generally fair. The story going sci-fi(ish) is a tad surprising perhaps. But I consider that better than the rubbish FR cosmology. *shrugs*<br><br>I'd like to see an epic mod that didn't use the planes or level strips sometime. If it could tell a good story and be well balanced I'd be impressed.

Uh, you're losing focus avado. Clerics are not gods, you want to know why? gods are selfish jackasses. They wouldn't take the trouble of coming down to our plane of existence and smite an orc for some crappy quest or the like, that's no god-doing. Instead they rip off the real gods into lending them their power with no real compensation and do what they want with it.

There are some rules I just couldn't point out by playing and testing, or I just missed stuff. Well-informed advice is great help. But frankly, a "most powerful build" request is so unrealistic I can't get myself to advice "properly".<br><br>avado saying Cleric is starting to get redundant alright, I can't but laugh at it though. Some entertainment is also pretty nice.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 01/10/09 06:33</span></i></p>

Seriously, most powerful melee build in a decently balanced NWN PvM environment is so totally a cleric.  I don't care if an effort was made to 'balance' the obscene power that is the NWN cleric, they still have plenty left to wipe the floor with all of the competition.<br><br>So, basically, you have two choices to argue: is it the cleric26/bard4/RDD10, or the cleric35/fighter2/rogue3.  Between them it can only come down to environment.<br><br>Yup, I said it, and maybe it aint true, but I believe it, and if D&amp;D has taught me anything, it's that that belief is enough to get several castings of extended Divine Favor every time I rest, and that's enough for me.
