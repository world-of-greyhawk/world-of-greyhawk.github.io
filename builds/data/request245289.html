Ok I have been toying with a level 30 bard build to get maximum bard song, I was thinking charisma heavy (around 30) to help with the required perform skill. This leaves 10 levels to play with, as it seems a shame to waste that charisma I wanted Paladin or Blackguard for the saves boosts.<br><br>I'd have preferred Paladin but whilst the server I play on allows swings from Good to evil and vice versa I haven't discovered a way to go from Chaos to Law.<br><br>So I thought 4 levels of Blackguard, this gets me a nice save boost, bulls strength and allows me to take diveine might and divine shield. If I take them pre epic I can also achieve 4 attacks per round.<br><br>This leaves me 6 levels to play with - after checking the search engine I'm still at a loss.<br><br>More bard is pointless as it will only get me more bard song uses - and with lasting inspiration and bard 30 I doubt I will need any more.<br><br>Blaackguard to 10 will get me a couple of summons and some sneak attack.<br><br>Palemaster 6 gets me a small boost to AC, a bone arm and a couple of summons<br><br>Red Dragon Disciple would get me a small boost to AC and +4 strength<br><br>If I shift alignment CoT will net me 3 feats and +3 to saves, as well as a low level lay on hands.<br><br>Fighter could get me WS and EWS but then i'd feel obliged to use that weapon all the time - and I like the fact with UMD I can pick up and use almost every weapon in the game.<br><br>At the cost of two pre epic feats and an alignment change I could take harper scout post epic and net two more grea charisma's then take Blackguard to level 5.<br><br>I havent actually decided on a build yet but have played around with the above choices in a character creator. So far the boost to strength from RDD or the extra feats from CoT (even with the alignment shift) seem to be the better options.<br><br>So what would people suggest? 6 levels of a class to mix with a bard 30/Blackguard 4 and bearing in mind that changing alignment along the law/chaos axis isn't available - which rules out 6 levels of monk or paladin, both of which would go really well......<br><br>thx in advance for any and all help.

As Thax pointed out, Uncanny Dodge has no effect on keeping your Dodge AC. It only lets you retain your DEX-based AC. If flat-footed, you still lose all Dodge bonuses (including Tumble).<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...

Thanks for the advice guys - I hadn't considered barbarian...<br><br>as for not wanting weapon focus etc. and knocking 6 damage I'm not. its just if i focus and specialise in say rapier but then find a great holy avenger longsword i could wield with UMD i'll still think i need to use a rapier otherwise i'll be wasting the feats - i guess im just like that.<br><br>hmmmmmm i'll have to have a play about - fighter, PM or RDD still winning....<br><br><br>(and yes i confess to only thinking of fighter as WS and EWS - ignoring the fact that bonus feats are bonus feats regardless....)

I don't know how fixed you are on maxing bard song.

Immunities to Fire, Paralisis and Sleep come until RDD level 10.<br><br>The STR would also give him AB, I hardly think taking RDD would be a dexer build, that's just wrong, you need to take advantage of what you get.<br><br>EDIT: Wait a second... you're pointing for him to take 10 RDD or PM levels!? that kind of gets it right, sorry man.

I wasn't very clear in my previous post, I was trying to point out that sacrificing 4 or 5 bard levels doesn't adversely affect the build too much and that the levels would be better spent taking either RDD or PM to level 10.<br><br>It's obviously the OP's call.

Yeah I'd thought of 10 of RDD or PM, however I'm curious to try a bard build with fully maxed bard song. which means level 30 and perform 100<br><br>with 43 perform, skill and epic skill focus perform, 30 charisma, epic gloves of the minstrel and +12 charisma items i make it something like 102 perform skill.<br><br>+12 cha items should be possible on the server i play on with eagles splendour cast.<br><br>means i cut back on other things though and the build is far from a power build. I'm playing around with various options at the minute - might have a build up by the weekend to be torn apart and rebuilt.

A build with lvl 30 Bard song is quite a power. In a party you will have a great effect with your song giving a substantial bonus to AB, damage, AC, HPs, saves and skills. The effect of the curse song can be devastating.<br>Just the effect on skills alone can be enough to turn the tables completely. The song gives a +19 bonus to all skills and the curse song has a negative effect of the same magnitude.<br>This greatly increases the chance of spotting a hidden enemy, disarming or knocking him down, or perhaps taunting him, just to give some examples.<br>Your rogue will also be able to sneak around scouting and clearing the path of traps like never before. <br>With a high bard lvl and high charisma, you can also have some fun with the enchantment spells. Unless you are on a server where every creature has immunity to mind spells.<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan
