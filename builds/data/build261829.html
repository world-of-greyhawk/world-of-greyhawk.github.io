Build Name: SpitBall<br><br>This build focuses on the Death Slaad shape.  It's main tactic is to HIPS and Chaos Spit for 10d4(Magical) damage.<br>Only Armor merges so you should get something with Haste or HIDE/MS buffs on it.  Strength will improve your Range Touch Attack (used during Spit).<br><br>I took 24 Shifter Levels because the Spit Damage is a divide by 3 calculation. ((Shifter levels / 3) + 2)d4.  So it was 24 or 27 Shifter levels to max out the damage.  I chose to add more Shadow Dancer levels in order to get Improved Evasion and better Shadow Evade.  Also wanted to max out Hide/Ms/Tumble along the way.  I took improved Combat Casting because I believe that the act of spitting is just like casting a spell, so it may invoke an AoO.

(A normal attack needs to hit its target solidly to have an effect. A character who swings a sword that glances off an opponent's shield has touched his target, but the swing is considered a miss since it could not inflict damage. In game terms, the attack roll was less than the target's AC.) Touch attacks can be either ranged or melee. One example of a ranged touch attack is an Ettercap's web bolt attack. The web bolt merely has to touch the target to attach itself, binding the target to the ground.<br><br>A touch attack uses simplified attack bonus and armor class calculations. The attack bonus for a touch attack is generally base attack bonus + strength modifier. For touch attacks, the armor class of the target does not include armor, shield, and natural armor. All other AC modifiers, such as the size modifier, dexterity modifier, and deflection/dodge bonus (if any) apply normally. <br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->  <br><br><br>So, this build would not need a huge amount of AB to land a hit.

Hmm, you shouldn't end with 29 WIS, no good on an odd score like that, you don't even get Owl's Insight to increase it so you can't say it's because your buffs will even it, I suggest you to change Great Wisdom for something better, but I'm not sure what you could get to work shifted... Epic Toughness works, might be something, or more Epic Energy Resistance.<br><br>Strange, actually.

I love shifter builds, they can be so innovative. Good job.<br>_________________<br>They were all dead. The final gunshot was an exclamation mark to everything that had led up to this point. I released my finger from the trigger. And then it was all over. The storm seemed to lose its frenzy. The ragged clouds gave way to the stars above.

Given that fact, it left me with one odd number stat.  I tried to make this a playable build instead of an instant lvl 40 build.

And I believe that if you take Zen Archery it will work with your spit attack.

I actually tested that yesterday, because it seemed like Zen Archery would be a very good feat for this build to take if it did work, but much to my surprise, it doesn't.  Your RTA has the same AB with or without Zen Archery.
