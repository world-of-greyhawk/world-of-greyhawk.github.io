All,<br><br>Had been playing around with various builds trying to create a character who could do both melee and ranged damage equally well and still be playable. Here is what I ended up with, he was a lot of fun to play.<br><br>Race: Human<br>Starting attribs: S17,D13,C11,W10,I13,Ch10<br>Finishing attribs: S25,D15,C12,W10,I13,Ch10 Keep adding strength until you hit 25 then spread them out where ever you see fit.<br><br>6 levels as Fighter,<br>7 levels as WM,<br>15 levels as Barb,<br>12 levels as Fighter.<br><br>Feats as follows:<br>Dodge, Mobility, Luck of Hero's, Expertise, Spring Attack, Whirlwind, WF Battle Axe.<br>Weapon of Choice Battle Axe, WF Throwing Axe, Improved Critical Battle Axe, Improved Critical Throwing Axe.<br>Power Attack, Cleave, Greater Cleave, Epic WF Battle Axe, Epic WF Throwing Axe, Point Blank Shot.<br>WS Battle Axe, WS Throwing Axe, Epic WS Battle Axe, Epic WS Throwing Axe, OC Battle Axe, OC Throwing Axe, DC Battle Axe, DC Throwing Axe, and Epic Prowess.<br><br>Character ends up with an AC of 12 bare and 360 HP.<br>Fort saves: 24<br>Reflex saves: 22<br>Will saves: 17<br>BAB 30<br><br>Attacks 38/33/28/23, with a plain Battle Axe that goes up to 42/37/32/27 with damage 0f 1-8 +13. With a plain Throwing Axe it ends up 35/30/25/20 with damage 1-6 +13.<br><br>I choose the Battle Axe/Throwing Axe combo to allow him to use a shield regardless of whether he was engaged in melee or ranged combat and because I did not have to waste a feat on any kind of weapon proficiency. I also did not want to use any feats to boost attributes.<br><br>I created this character on the CEP novice to epic character building module and play tested him. I might have his starting attributes out by one, I didn't keep my notes. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  <br><br>Given this is my first post, I'm interested to hear any comments you may have.<br>_________________<br>Nothing sadder than seeing a beautiful theory getting slammed by an ugly fact!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ReallyTwisted on 10/15/04 06:32</span></i></p>

Maybe you want to consider taking more weapon master levels in order to pick up throwing axes as a second superior weapon focus.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

I'm under the impression that the throwing axe does not qualify as a melee weapon for use as a pre-requisite for Weapon Master? If that is not the case how many levels of WM do you need? I have always just used seven levels of WM as there is diminshing returns after that...<br>_________________<br>Nothing sadder than seeing a beautiful theory getting slammed by an ugly fact!

I have a variation of this build that substitutes the barbarian levels with CoT, the result is much better saves as a whole, and the loss of damage reduction. To make the comparison simple I consider Divine Wrath and Rage roughly equivalent, if there is any interest I'll post that build as well.<br>_________________<br>Nothing sadder than seeing a beautiful theory getting slammed by an ugly fact!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ReallyTwisted on 10/19/04 05:48</span></i></p>
