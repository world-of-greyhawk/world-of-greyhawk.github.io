Hi all!<br><br>I would like to build a monk with the following multiclass limitations:<br><br>Classes available are fighter, weapon master, shadow dancer and assassin. The character must have taken a minimum of 6 levels in each extra class by the time they reach level 40. Multiclassing will start on the 13th level, with a level of monk being taken every third level. If a tertiary level is taken then the second and third levels must never differ by more than double the amount of the lowest class. <br><br>...and was wondering if I could get some suggestions from the Masters.   =]<br><br>Race, Alignment (except for being Lawful) don't matter and class mix doesn't matter (except as noted above).  Stealther or Brick, doesn't matter.<br><br>Good luck, and Thanks, in advance!   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Let me just point out one thing regarding this. Don't take circle kick, it is bugged. I'll explain the ones I remember. <br><br>You target the enemy you want to take out first, you hit and perform a circle kick, your char picks a target out of range and just stands there flat-footed. If you click you start attacking next round. Two out of 8 attacks round 1. You hit your main enemy in round two and circle kicks, hits a new target, but you wanna take out your main enemy and clicks back to him. your char stands there the rest of the round until the new begins since you changed targets.<br>If you don't change back, your char will spend the rest of his flurry on his new targets, if you keep doing this you will change targets randomly once a round.....<br><br>It is not supposed to change your target, just deliver a free kick, but changes he does. I avoid that feat. I advice you to also. It is okay until you get more attacks, but that's it.

SC III isn't worth it in this build. Take Great DEX at lvl 36 to even your ending dex and gain 1 AB and Ac in it to. Take epic prowess and Armor skin for the other two SC feats. It gives you even 1 more AB and 2 AC, for a total of 2 AB and 3 AC. Not bad.

I'd reconsider the skill foci, you can get something more useful there (save boosters, called shot, zen archery for example).<br>Empty body and shadow evade are short lived, SC is permanent and that's quite an advantage. I don't know how much SC III is worth the effort, I always try to go for at least SC IV.<br><br>Those leveling rules are awful, you could get EP and AS with the same BAB by moving fighter in epic

Self concealment is not worth it at all due to the monk's feat empty body. That will last you a reasonable amount of time staying in 50 % concealment.<br><br>The circle kick was implemented because if you are smart enough, the bug isn't that big of a challenge. The point is to retarget your enemy after the circle kick has been shown on the screen. Then you recieve all your attacks. And if it is for duels, then the circle kick is a MUST. 1 extra attack is always worth to take.<br>_________________<br>Be realistic...

I've used it in the way I explained very effectively. It hasn't been bad for me to use the feat. You gain the extra attack on your target as well, if you have an entire screeen with only one opponent. This I have learned by using the feat. I have experienced the situations you talk about, but I can just retarget to gain all my attacks.<br>_________________<br>Be realistic...

I think I may just do a Monk/Fighter.  Three classes with the restrictions listed seems too limiting.<br><br>So I'm considering pre-epic 12 Monk, then 4 Fighter then 4 Monk.  Epic levels I need at least two more Fighter levels but I'm not really sure when to pop them in there.  I want to get Wisdom to 19 so I can pump my Stunning Fist DC via Improved Stunning Fist which I figure to take on the Fighter levels (as well as Epic Weapon Specialization).<br><br>Does anybody have any advice on when those Fighter levels should come and how many would most advantageous?

I am playing a build that meets the criteria and is very efficient: Monk 20, WM 7, Fighter 13.  The character is strenght-based using a 2-handed weapon.  He can sneak very well, has all the monk goodies and a not too shabby AB and damage (very nice crits <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> ).  His AC is the weaker point however; being built on the principle of killing the other bastard faster than he kills you!<br><br>I can post the details when I come back from work, but a few of them come up on the search engine.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Drallimer on 12/27/05 14:19</span></i></p>

Why use a 2-handed weapon with a monk? Use kama's for a monk WM build, preferably dual-wielding. The level split sounds fine.<br><br>For simple monk/fighter builds, I like the str-based ones. I just posted a monk/fighter/CoT build on the epic character builders forum (the Temple Guardian), you could just replace the CoT levels with fighter levels (end at Monk 30/Fighter 10). There is an unarmed version and a kama version. The fighter/CoT levels let you use all of the general feats for Great Str, ending at 32 Str, but you could drop down to 6 fighter levels and still end up at Str 30 (or Str 32 but drop 2 of the other feats, your choice).<br><br>TM
