I know this is a Epic Character builders forum, but... maybe we could have a section with diffent level of builds to suite all 3 OC...<br><br>So we could have a level 15-18 builds section (for NwN OC and SoU OC)<br><br>And another section with level 25-28 builds (for HotU OC)<br><br>What do you think ?<br>_________________<br>Life is a short warm moment and death is a long cold rest...

I think it's a good idea if enough people are interested enough to post their own builds, because I'm not going hunting around for those builds.  My sole concern is the ECB threads. And non-epic builds should definitely be separate <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

My concern was : how many people really use those builds at the end ?  It's shure fun to do, to read, but who play them ? On the other side, everybody need a build to play the OCs, so that's why I come up with this idea...<br><br>But if no one is really interested I will not be sad at all ! It's just a suggestion ! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Life is a short warm moment and death is a long cold rest...

Well, I have never finished any of the OCs myself <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  its online MP thats interesting to me, the RP aspect especially... and on a Persistent World Server, there tend to be a lot of maximum level characters. There are even local vault servers where you can make your own lvl40 character and then bring them into a MP environment right away without the hassle of levelling <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Lots of max level PvP going on out there too, so when you're talking about the world of multiplayer NWN, 40th level builds make perfect sense <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Certainly we should include builds appropriate to the OCs too, we just don't have a reliable supply of these type of builds..yet <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  see the "Any Idea?" topic for more on this...I'm gonna lock this now and maybe move it into that topic anyway <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">
