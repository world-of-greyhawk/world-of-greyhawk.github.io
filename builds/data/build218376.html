Hm, three quite equal variants here. I believe this is the best one. It will really be a hard to kill guy, even if they are able to hit you. Quite nice ab to. It's a very solid, strong build.<br><br>I have personal issues though. Do not take them personal, they are kinda compliments to. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br>I can barely imagine a DEX based DD, I see dwarves in another fashion, and almost always make STR Dwarves.<br>Issue two; RAPIER!!! A dex based Dwarf wielding rapier? No way you will ever see me build that. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

I'm happy this one turned out good. Btw V.2 is my personal favourite too, I posted the others for reference and for those who would like to get SCV/ED or who would like to go dual wield as the dwarflord wisely suggested.<br>SCIV coupled with ED is enough to avoid most of the attacks...the enemy can really barely hit you...and when you get hit you soak off 12 points of damage each time.<br>I built it and used it and I'm quite satisfied with it. Others might find one of the other variants more suited to their tastes.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò
