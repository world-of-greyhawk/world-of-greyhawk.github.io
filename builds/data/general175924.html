I just finished building a Wizard 8/Pale Master 20/Monk 12 with the intention of getting the highest possible naked AC.<br><br>I was able to get my AC to 42, which I think is pretty good for no equipment and no buffs, but I'm wondering if it's possible to go higher?<br><br>My  stats were (start/finish):<br>STR- 10/10<br>DEX- 10/10<br>CON- 12/12<br>INT- 16/22<br>WIS- 16/26<br>CHA- 8/8<br><br>I probably could've sacrificed 2 points of INT for +2 to WIS and +1 to AC, but I'm curious if a different distribution of points would've been better. <br><br>With Boots of Striding +10, the amulet of Wisdom +10, robes of Shining Hand +6,  cloak of fortification +6, and bracers of Dex +10 this build had an AC of 64.

Well, first of all, I assume you took Armor skin as a feat, right?<br><br>Then, I have not tested this, but wouldn't 2 lvl's of monk, and more lvls of pale master give you more AC?<br><br>In fact, won't 7 WIZ/ 3 MONK / 30 Pale Master give you more than what you have? I haven't tested this, purely speculation, but having more monk lvl's seems pointless, where more PM lvl's gives you more AC every 2 or 4 lvl's, if I'm not mistaken.<br><br>It would of course be a pretty useless character besides for a high AC, but that was the point of the build, not?

The Pale Master gains a +2 to AC every 4 levels after 8th. So level 28 is that last level they'd gain an AC bonus. <br><br>I suppose I intuitively wanted a sort of useful character and knew that taking 12 Monk levels would give me decent Monk abilities. <br><br>The Wizard 9/Pale Master 28/Monk 3 would give me an AC of 47 with my Wisdom at 26. <br><br>Still, I think I can do better. A Dex-based Bard/RDD/PM, maybe?
