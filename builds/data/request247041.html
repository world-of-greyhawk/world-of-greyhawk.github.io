Some specifics I'm looking for are:<br><br>Unarmed attacker<br>Moves in and out of combat area very quickly.<br>High PP DC.<br>Casts True Strike as a spell.<br>Has HIPS, or at least high ranks in hide/move silent<br><br>I was thinking about going monk/wiz/sd, but would like to get my AB high enough to do the job of disarming most builds.  I could use a large melee weapon to improve the odds of disarm I suppose, but then there's the issue of picking up the weapon afterwards; something I don't always have time to do.

If you read the high PP thread someone else started, you'll read my suggestion of a Druid/Monk/SD build based on Elder Air Elemental form.<br><br>An alternative would be Elder Earth Elemental form for a nice disarmer.<br><br>The Elder Earth Elemental is a "huge" size, so his weapon is concidered that size too.

Here's a build I think you'll like.  I do.  I play something simular to this on BoW.  It's an Assasin Elder Earth Elemental.  The AB isn't hot, but with proper armor and maxed Str spell it will help.<br><br>Note:  Because you will be hunting in an Elemental form, you will only merge your armor properties.  You will be SLOW in Earth Elemental Form, but strong as heck.  12d6 sneak attack with +13 STR damage bonus on your big old rock fists will knock some sense into anyone.<br><br>- I chose Dwarf for the +2 vs spells and the CON bonus.<br>- Assasin instead of Rogue because the assasin spell feats can be used while shifted.<br>- Epic Damage Reduction because you are slow and will need to soak some hits.<br>- Fire protection vs those enchanted flamed weapons.<br>- Acid protection so you can smack an acid shield mage.<br>- You could replace Acid for Cold in order to protect vs Rak ice storm better.<br>- 19 wis is all you need, I dumped the remaining points into INT so as to increase the Death Attack chance.  You could put wis at 20 to get that +1 on will saves, but as an Elemental, you're immune to mind spells anyways.<br>- Dex is 13 because of Dodge/Mobility req.<br>- I like to hunt with an Elemental Swarm Spell on.  Helps to get the foe to attack the Elemental first and you come in with the sneak attack.<br>- you could take another Druid lvl @38 in order to max Spellcraft for +4 saves vs spells, but that would take away 1d6 sneak and 1 DC on your Death attack.<br>- I suggest Wolf as your animal companion, they have a fear howl that will help.<br>- rearrange the stat powerups if this is a pure 40 build or if you are lvling up as you go. (taking Int early means more skill points).<br><br><br>Pros:<br>Lots of immunities<br>Nice sneak damage 12d6<br>damage resistance 9/-, 15/+3<br>Looks Cool<br>DC 32 Death Attack<br><br><br>Cons:<br>LOW AB<br>No Disc<br>SLOW<br><br><br>Druid(20), Assassin(19), Shadowdancer(1), Dwarf<br>             Elder Earth Form<br>STR: 8       [30]<br>DEX: 13      [10]<br>CON: 17 (21) [22]<br>WIS: 16 (19)<br>INT: 14 (17)<br>CHA: 6<br><br><br>01: Dr(1): Dodge<br>02: Dr(2)<br>03: Dr(3): Mobility<br>04: Dr(4): CON+1, (CON=18)<br>05: Dr(5)<br>06: Dr(6): Extend Spell<br>07: Dr(7)<br>08: Dr(8): CON+1, (CON=19)<br>09: Dr(9): Maximize Spell<br>10: Dr(10)<br>11: Dr(11)<br>12: Dr(12): CON+1, Improved Critical: Unarmed, (CON=20)<br>13: Dr(13)<br>14: Dr(14)<br>15: Dr(15): Knockdown<br>16: Dr(16): CON+1, (CON=21)<br>17: Dr(17)<br>18: Dr(18): Improved Knockdown<br>19: Dr(19)<br>20: Dr(20): WIS+1, (WIS=17)<br>21: As(1): Epic Damage Reduction I<br>22: SD(1)<br>23: As(2)<br>24: As(3): WIS+1, Epic Damage Reduction II, (WIS=18)<br>25: As(4)<br>26: As(5)<br>27: As(6): Epic Damage Reduction III<br>28: As(7): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br>29: As(8)<br>30: As(9): Epic Prowess<br>31: As(10)<br>32: As(11): INT+1, (INT=15)<br>33: As(12): Epic Energy Resistance: Fire I<br>34: As(13)<br>35: As(14): Epic Skill Focus: Hide<br>36: As(15): INT+1, Epic Energy Resistance: Acid I, (INT=16)<br>37: As(16)<br>38: As(17)<br>39: As(18): Improved Sneak Attack I, Improved Sneak Attack II<br>40: As(19): INT+1, (INT=17)<br><br><br>Hitpoints: 482<br>Skillpoints: 265<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 27/26/17<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +6, Traps: +2, Poison: +7, Fear: +2<br>BAB: 25<br>AB (max, naked): 25 (melee), 27 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 19/27<br>Spell Casting: Druid(9)<br>Alignment Changes: 0<br><br><br>Hide 43(54), Move Silently 43(44), Search 43(46), Spellcraft 20(23), Spot 43(47), Tumble 40(41), UMD 17(15)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 07/20/06 14:40</span></i></p>
