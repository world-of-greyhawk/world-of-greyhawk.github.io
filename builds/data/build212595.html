The lack of concentration would make it hard to survive as a caster, and str is low unbuffed. Leveled cleric until 20 and took 5 CoT levels in epic plus an additional level at 40. At level 40, which is what I tested it at, it made a very decent caster against groups of enemies or a single enemy at a distance, and although its ac isn't very high I never sustained much damage with greater stoneskin and extended regeneration(6regen for 1.5rd/level). Pretty good all around except again I'm not sure how leveling would be, suggestions very welcome. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>(Edited 9/13/05 16:08 for coherence)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ChaoticBlades on 09/13/05 21:09</span></i></p>
