I have a build thats a lot like that (never posted it though). Just wondering does the str actually matter? or does it get set once u shapeshift. If the later then you're better off putting the stats in wiz and getting outsider shape. That way you can deal with mages too when u see them. As a rakshasa with 24/- dr or so you can shrug off melee attacks while you pound the mage.<br><br>Alternatly you can put the stat points in dex since I don't think risen lord affects that and that way u get a few ac more.

The high str is to get dev crit only since yes<br>risen lord has 21 str regardless. The idea here<br>was to maximize DR while having high damage output.<br><br>This build was more of puzzle to solve than a build<br>I would use myself. The version of this build I use<br>on a PW right now, has gone the dex route as you<br>mentioned, with just enough str for great cleave<br>and no more. But some people are truly crazy about<br>dev crit and won't consider a build without it, so <br>I wanted to see if epic damage reduction 3 and<br>dev crit can both be achieved in risen lord, and they<br>can. <br><br>More of a "can it be done?" thing.<br><br>Well if you want to be a undead scythe wielding<br>dev criting super tank this will do it. Since you<br>don't get dev crit till 40 though this build on <br>a server vault PW would take enormous patience.<br><br>But you do end up with 39 DR naked at the end<br>even without items and are immune to almost everything<br>you can be immune to.

I think if you started off with 18 con/16 str it would open up 2 additional stat points you can stick in something else.

Something i've noticed with the risen lord that i havnt seen mentioned on the question of "i don't think the risen lord affects you dex" is that it actually applies a -2 modifier to it :s<br><br>Just something i noticed...<br>_________________<br>Why do I always have to think of a profound signature?

You tried this as an elf or halfling and subsequently lost your racial +2 dex in the shifted form.

And the odds are good that it wasn't tried as an Elf or Halfling since this is a Dwarven Defender build.<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">

Risen Lord does not reduce the dex by two, but rather keeps it the same.  Only elf and halfing appear reduced by two because the racial +2 is negated.  The fact that the build the post is attached to is neither elf nor halfing, but rather dwarf, means the post had no relevance to the build, but instead made an incorrect conjecture about the shape risen lord.
