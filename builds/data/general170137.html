1.  When making an archer, does more dex = more damage?  As far as I can tell the only damage comes from AA levels and from STR bonus on mighty bows?<br>2. Is there any benefit to high Perform on a bard, or does it cap out at the 6th level 12 perform, etc listed when you inspect the skill? <br>3. How does damage reduction stack?  If i have a 6/30 armor and epic damage reduction 3 9/- what exactly does that mean?<br>3. b ...If i were to make a Barbarian / Dwarven Defender with high const / epic dr would all of the reductions stack? (on a build server just to see).  I havent been able to see how I can notice.<br><br>That is all I can think of for now.  I have tried quite a few builds on my own...and played 2 to level 40 so far.  Thank you for the help thus far in builds.  It is tough to find them sometimes but its worth spending the time sifting through =).

The best is always taken when two are considered.<br>DR "+X/Y" or "Y/+X" or "+X soak Y" means that if you are hit by a weapon with an enchantement lower than X, you deduce up to Y physical damage. For example, "30/+5" stops 30 damage from any weapon +4 or lower. "9/-" Means that you block 9 damage from any physical damage source, whatever the enchantement may be.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/14/04 10:42:28 (GMT) -- Fumongo<br>3. b ...If i were to make a Barbarian / Dwarven Defender with high const / epic dr would all of the reductions stack?

Thank you for the response.<br>Just to clarify..the bard question..I was using the 6 / 12 as a for instance.  There is a relation between the level and the perform that has to be reached to get any benefit, so a higher level without perform, or perform without level doesnt seem to do anything at all.  It only seems to work if you follow the template they list in the inspect of bard song.   Lots of templates state 40 perform when they are just level 6 bards etc.<br><br>As for the DR...will an Item DR stack with the feat DR's?  That is mostly where my confusion came from.  The PW i have  learned on has a lot of DR items, so i have a 6/30 laying around that I can give any character.  If the epic DR is negated I will never waste so many feats and attributes getting it =)
