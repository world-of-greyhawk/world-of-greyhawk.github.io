I wanted to buils a pure rogue, but since rogues (for whatever reason) do not get Hide in plain site, I added 1 lvl of SD.  I know... I know... "power build" but I think it is not worth having a high hide and move silent if you always have to run away to use it...

You need to add Fighter. The more the merrier -- but at least six levels. Weapon Specialization and all that. Hell, you don't even have Weapon Focus, that's messed up. I suggest you get 14 level of Fighter to beef him up a bit (actually a lot).<br><br>EDIT: yeah, you say pure rogue, but since you already added SD because Rogues don't get HiPS, you surely can add Ftr because Rogues don't get EWS either <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif"><br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 07/27/06 19:06</span></i></p>

Actaully, the "Rogue Archer" build on the Bioware Epic Build pages is a very strong build.  Rogue Fighter SD.  very nice sneak damage.<br><br>Tweeking it here and there is still fine.
