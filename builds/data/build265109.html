In principal I frown upon Rak Ice Storm Spammers, but here is a build anyways.

But since it's a CC skill, I could only get it to a marginal level anyways, so I opted not to use it.  Feel free to modify the skills to suit your taste of course.  (Rak get's +5 Disc and +3 because of 17 Str).<br><br>This Rak is a welcome addition to any Party out there.  Clerics are always in high demand, and this guy can dish out some damage.

Cleric is a curious variant, you probably didn't find much builds focused like yours since a general Rakshasa build is Druid/Monk/Shifter, which nets a stronger storm and a higher AC, many shifters pick Monk anyways.<br><br>But it's not bad to use Cleric, especially from the addition of Trickery Domain which grants Improved Invisibility, and it's a great style for a caster Cleric, normally Clerics go melee but a caster/healer/buffer should be nice.

Thanks, I wanted to put a different Rak out there.  I could have gone all out Druid for more Ice Storm punch, but that's been done, over and over.  60 points from cold aint to bad. Only 2d6 away from the top Ice Stormering Raks out there. And, if they have a Monk level, then they are only 1d6 better than this build (see the spell description).  As a Cleric, this build is a better party member (imho) since he can buff others better than a pure Druid.<br><br>Mage Armor, Bark Skin, Magic Vestment, Stone Skin, Improved Invisibility, aid, bless, etc...<br><br>I think this guy would follow Auril, The Icemaiden.  A lesser Diety in the Forgotten Realms.  Portfolio = cold/winter

Well, I've been playing this build on a PW for some time now.  I currently have him up to level 27.  As I've played this build I've learned a few things....<br><br>Raks provoke AoO when spamming ice storm.<br>Ice Storm is affected by SR.<br>Spellcasters need to avoid AoO while casting in/near mellee.<br>Raks are not tanks.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br>Raks are immune to Basilisk and Medusa Gaze attacks.<br><br>With these lesson firmly in place, I've modified this build and trimmed out what wasn't needed, and prioritized what was.<br><br>Gone are: Luck of Heros, Blind fighting, epic fort and the Epic spells.<br><br>Added are: SP/GSP/ESP, More CON, Improved Combat Casting earlier.<br><br>Some skills didn't need further improving after a certain point.  I didn't need more Concentration after getting Improved Combat Casting.  Sure it would help vs taunt, but if they want to spend a round taunting me, I'll lay down at ice storm on their head.  My Self buff ac @ lvl 27 was about 43. It's the Improved Invis that helps this build alot.  Heal didn't need to be boosted so high since he's mostly shifted after a certain point in his life.  Regen items are key.  I decided to pump Pick Pocket since as a Trickery Domain user, he can buff that skill.  You also can't pick a shifter, but he can pick you.  This can be substituted with Open Lock.  The Find Trap spell can handle disarming traps.<br><br>=====<br><br>Druid(5), Cleric(25), Shifter(10), Human<br><br>STR: 8<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 16 (22)<br>WIS: 18 (26)<br>INT: 12<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 600<br>Skillpoints: 202<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 31/30/18<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Fear: +2<br>BAB: 23<br>AB (max, naked): 22 (melee), 22 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 15/26<br>Spell Casting: Druid(3),Cleric(9)<br>Alignment Changes: 0<br><br>Concentration 30(36), Heal 13(21), Lore 7(8), Pick Pocket 21(20), Spellcraft 43(44), Spot 27(37), Tumble 20(19)<br><br><br>01: Cl(1): Toughness, Extend Spell, Domain Trickery, Domain Magic<br>02: Cl(2)<br>03: Cl(3): Empower Spell<br>04: Cl(4): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br>05: Cl(5)<br>06: Cl(6): Combat Casting<br>07: Cl(7)<br>08: Cl(8): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br>09: Cl(9): Maximize Spell<br>10: Dr(1)<br>11: Dr(2)<br>12: Dr(3): WIS+1, Alertness, (WIS=21)<br>13: Dr(4)<br>14: Dr(5)<br>15: Sh(1): Spell Penetration<br>16: Sh(2): WIS+1, (WIS=22)<br>17: Sh(3)<br>18: Sh(4): Greater Spell Penetration<br>19: Sh(5)<br>20: Sh(6): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br>21: Sh(7): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=24)<br>22: Sh(8)<br>23: Sh(9)<br>24: Sh(10): WIS+1, Outsider Shape, (WIS=25)<br>25: Cl(10)<br>26: Cl(11)<br>27: Cl(12): Improved Combat Casting<br>28: Cl(13): WIS+1, (WIS=26)<br>29: Cl(14)<br>30: Cl(15): Epic Spell Penetration<br>31: Cl(16)<br>32: Cl(17): CON+1, (CON=17)<br>33: Cl(18): Great Constitution I, (CON=18)<br>34: Cl(19)<br>35: Cl(20)<br>36: Cl(21): CON+1, Great Constitution II, (CON=20)<br>37: Cl(22)<br>38: Cl(23): Armor Skin<br>39: Cl(24): Great Constitution III, (CON=21)<br>40: Cl(25): CON+1, (CON=22)

Heh, Ice Storm has never breached SR, you'll need Earthquake or Creeping Doom for that, Epic Spell Penetration will definitely improve your storms.<br><br>You already had Improved Combat casting on your initial build... too late for practical use?

I try to make my builds playable form 1 to 40.  The first build had Improved Combat casting at lvl 38.  During my actual playing of this build I was getting smacked around way to much by AoO when mobs surrounded me.  Taking it ASAP was a life saver.  Having high concentration is one thing, but not having to make that roll is way better.
