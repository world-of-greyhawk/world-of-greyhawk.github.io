Not very used class progress, but there are a pair of other bard/paladin/arcane archer, anyway, this archer is my attempt for ultimate power on ranged (without sneak attack, which doesn't works very well), although without crazy starting CHA because, although more CHA and STR make it stronger, it’s obviously not worth it. The idea is to take full Enchant Arrow with high divine damage from divine might, some paladin spells, arcane spells and bard song for a bit more. <br><br>Playable Levels: 1-40<br>PvM, untested PvP<br> <br>Race: Elf<br> <br>Alignment: Lawful good ------&gt; any nonlawful<br> <br>It's quite easy to control the alignment at any rate, only one change at level 8, to be able to become Bard.<br> <br>Stats<br> <br>Strength 14<br>Dexterity 16 (18)<br>Constitution 12<br>Intelligence 10<br>Wisdom 12<br>Charisma 14 (30)<br> <br><br>Leveling:<br><br>1 Paladin – Weapon Focus: Longbow <br>2 Paladin<br>3 Paladin – Power Attack<br>4 Paladin – CHA +1 (15)<br>5 Paladin<br>6 Paladin – Divine Might<br>7 Paladin<br>8 Paladin – CHA +1 (16)<br><br>9 Bard –Point Blank Shot<br>10 Arcane Archer<br>11 Arcane Archer<br>12 Arcane Archer – CHA +1 (17), Rapid Shot <br>13 Arcane Archer<br>14 Arcane Archer<br>15 Arcane Archer – Called Shot<br>16 Arcane Archer – CHA +1 (18)<br>17 Bard<br>18 Arcane Archer – Improved Critical: Longbow<br>19 Arcane Archer<br>20 Arcane Archer – CHA +1 (19)<br>21 Arcane Archer – Toughness<br>22 Arcane Archer<br>23 Arcane Archer<br>24 Arcane Archer – CHA +1 (20), Great CHA I (21), Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>25 Arcane Archer<br>26 Arcane Archer<br>27 Arcane Archer – Great CHA II (22)<br>28 Arcane Archer – CHA +1 (23), Epic Prowess<br>29 Arcane Archer<br>30 Arcane Archer – Great CHA III (24)<br>31 Arcane Archer<br>32 Arcane Archer – CHA +1 (25), Great DEX I<br>33 Arcane Archer – Great CHA IV (26)<br>34 Arcane Archer<br>35 Arcane Archer<br>36 Arcane Archer – CHA +1 (27), Great CHA V (28), Great DEX II<br>37 Arcane Archer<br>38 Arcane Archer<br>39 Arcane Archer – Great CHA VI (29)<br>40 Bard – CHA +1 (30)<br> <br>Toughness can be changed, for, maybe Armor Skin if you like, for what I understand Blind-Fight doesn’t works with ranged, but if it does, it would be better.<br> <br>Skills<br>Tumble 40<br>UMD: 40<br>Spellcraft 40<br>Taunt 21<br>Perform 9<br> <br>Saveing throws<br>Fortitude 34<br>Reflex 33<br>Will 29<br> <br>HP: 410 (counting Toughness)<br>AC: 22<br>BAB: 29<br>Naked AB: +32<br>AB with normal longbow: +51/+46/+41/+36<br> <br>Paladin spells: only 2 slots of level 1 spells, <b>but</b> level 2 spells are open, if you cap WIS (24) you’ll get 3 slots of level 1 and 2 slots of level 2, which is much more than nothing, you can buff decently for a short time.

Nobody posts.....<br><br>Well, he has several problems, like XP penalty and such....<br><br>After some more planning, for a short period of time, a fighter/paladin/CoT would get a stronger hit, divine wrath and EWS would be more than enchant arrrow 15... maybe even a fighter/cleric/CoT using divine power for the BAB and gets even more buffing power....... I think I'm going to make it, at least to replace this one, which seems dead for no posts, although it might go better with melee.....

Hmmm, I wouldn't know what to say, when I made the build I tested it and all the buffs worked (or at least that's what the Character Sheet said.... I'm starting to get my doubts) although the spell description does says it's on a melee weapon. You can as well say it doesn't works, 8 rounds is crap anyway.
