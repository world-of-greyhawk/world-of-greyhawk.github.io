<!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Harper Scout, the only class so powerful it is limited to 5 levels...</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Celadur looked around, there wasn’t much to see and he’d never been here before. In fact, he wasn’t even sure where here was anymore. He’d been traveling for so long, mostly working undercover for the Harpers, constantly on the look out for evil. And evil he had certainly found. He had hardly left the boat and already the rotten stench was in the air. A lot of good here could be done.<br><br>Sticking to the shadows as best he could, Celadur followed dark alleys, twisting narrow streets, getting a feel for the city, whilst also on his self-righteous mission. “Was it really so self-righteous?” he pondered, clutching his holy symbol tight, knowing for sure he’d be using some divine influence later.<br><br>“Stop, who goes there?” came a voice from the dark…<br><br>“You’re not welcome here…” came another voice from the dark, as more figures started appearing from the shadows.<br><br>Looking around now Celadur could see he was surrounded, maybe ten in visible sight, though he also spotted at least one figure in a nearby window. It didn’t look like there was going to be an easy way out of this, and unconsciously his fingers tightened around his kama. As it surely looked like a battle for sure he began to cast a few silent buffing spells.<br><br>“So what’s it going to be stranger?” the crowd parted as a larger figure now stepped into the centre directly facing Celadur, the dust billowing up in small vortexes as a leathery pair of dragon wings flapped at his back. He was openly brandishing a scimitar which still had blood running down the edge and didn’t look like he was afraid to use it. “We don’t take kindly to people poking their noses around here.”<br><br>Celadur looked at him, very well spoken though he was for a Half-Orc, he could only guess that his other parent had been a dragon. “You have made a mistake, I think you should put away your weapons and leave here unharmed!”<br><br>“Muhahaha…don’t make me laugh” retorted the Half-Dragon Half-Orc, and the whole crowd erupted in laughter. “There’s, Oh well I’m not going to tell you how many of us there are, but it certainly looks like there’s only one of you.”<br><br>“That as it may be, you have lost the only thing you had going for you…surprise” and with that Celadur threw off his cloak, the beautiful pair of Angel wings springing out from underneath. He leapt forward at the leader, knocking down with remarkable ease, springing back to attack as a couple of the crowd moved in. An arrow from above whizzing past his head as he easily deflected another with his free hand.<br><br>Blow after blow, Celadur landed with ease, the bodies piling around him. The leader was trying his best to hit him but had barely landed a blow and soon it was just them face to face. “Will you not concede defeat? You could escape with your life” offered Celadur.<br><br>“NEVER” as the Half-Orc Half-Dragon lunged forward with one final thrust. Celadur sprung sideways and lightly touched the flat-footed foe, the harmful spell draining most of his life-force, which was immediately snuffed out when the flurry of kama blows landed.<br><br>Tired but not exhausted Celadur looked around, it was a start, but he knew there was still much evil left in the city…but that could wait till tomorrow…<br><br><b>the Undiscovered Country <i>pt.

I see a couple of problems with the build: no ED, actually not even uncanny dodge (ouch!) and cleric spells available later than they could due to a too low WIS score. No uncanny dodge is a big issue IMO.<br><br>For domains I'd pick trickery and war, you'll cap your dex without any items with stackable cat's graces and AoV and get a nice boost to STR and CON too (and the HS eagle's splendor stackable with the cleric one will make Battle Mastery last longer when needed).<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 05/01/06 10:09</span></i></p>

I didn't really see the lack of Uncanny Dodge as a problem...the only way you are going to be flat-footed (and lose you Dex bonus) is if someone sneaks up on you!<br><br>True-seeing will easily protect against sneakers...and if that is NERFed, there is always Spot Skill...you can drop 1 Great Dex into a Great Wis &amp; take ESF: Spot on a HArper feat if it is!<br><br>The domains were mainly for the purpose of the story! And for very low magic enviroments! With the AB sitting on the +20 Cap, Battle Mastery is less necessary!

You are flat footed also when knocked down, held, dazed and so on, uncanny dodge would let you keep your DEX AC at least. The lack of ED in a dexer is also lamentable, dmg output is lowish and you'd could surely do with avoiding the first hit every round, since you'll need more time to kill them or to avoid having your harm interrupted. At least you've got undispellable II, but blind fight halves its usefulness.<br><br>Battle Mastery might indeed be of little use, but Cat's Grace and AoV are darn useful IMO.<br><br>Cleric rock anyhow, it's difficult to go wrong with them.<br><br>Nice story, by the way.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 05/01/06 10:30</span></i></p>

Unless you're playing the OCs, I wouldn't recommend your current configuration.  Let me explain.<br><br>You currently do an all-out blitz on Dexterity, and seem hellbent on increasing it at every opportunity.  Let me advise against this course.  If you are gunning for Epic Dodge, or Self Concealment, that is one thing. But you're not.  You don't even have Hide in Plain Sight.  Further, not having Uncanny Dodge is a <b>major</b> issue.  I've seen players build Dex-based characters without selecting a class that offers UD, and then they get their butts wiped consistently.  They complain that it's the environment, or that so-and-so is a killer DM, or that they don't want to "meta-game" and are just trying to play a concept character.  But Dexers without Uncanny Dodge is like a Paladin without Charisma....why?  The number of times and events where you'll be caught flatfooted are legion.  Nor will True-seeing or Spot be a failsafe.<br><br>Which brings me to the next point:  At 28th level you are a 22nd level Cleric, yet you still can't cast 7th, 8th, and 9th level spells.  In fact, you can't even cast 9th lvl spells until 39th level.  From level 14 through 28, I can't think of a better time to have such spells.  It's not like you have sneak attacks or any other Dex-associated things to back you up.  This also cuts into your bonus spells.  And while one can make the argument that there aren't any worthwhile spells from 7th-9th, I would argue that it's extremely shortsighted to assume that. One Finessed Kama with Darkfire isn't going to see you through all your encounters, nor will stacking Cats Graces.   <br><br>So, krsboss, I respect your decisions, but I would be remiss if I did not counsel you to reconsider your course of action.  If you must go Dex-based, take SD or Rogue (or even Barbarian) to get UD.  And if you must go 29Cleric, try to get some more Wisdom up front.  Give yourself the opportunity to at least cast 7-9th lvl spells pre-epic.  We can talk about DCs later.  <br><br>Good luck.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

It's a nice concept, particularly with my leaning to using HS in my builds recently, but personally I never see the point of Dex based clerics, particularly if no UD is awarded (see Grizz'z eloquent reasoning). But mainly because a Cleric can cast in armor and with a shield, thanks to thier divine magic.<br><br>Unfortunately I have tried a DEX based Cleric Monk once before, and I can honestly say never again. You get your butt served to you on a plate relying on the Dex AC bonus.<br><br>Anyway, aside from that, you would benefit from finishing with a WIS of 20 - extra 1st &amp; 5th spell, and +1 to WIS save.<br><br>Not sure that the HS abilities are fully utilised in this build, particularly with such a low CHA score. Your turn undead abilities are severely compromised with a base score of 8, dropping your starting DEX to 16 and freeing up 4 points could be more beneficial to you. Your stackable Eagle's Splendour could make this a prizes asset, particularly if you went down the route of War/ Trickery Domain and either dropping Travel.<br><br>Skill ranks of 12 &amp; 11 in Hide and Move Silently are  of little use in this build. You'd be better off maxing Spellcraft beforehand.<br><br>Could go Human to forego the xp penalty, but that's of little import I feel.<br><br>Your offensive spell casting DCs will be extremely low with a WIS of 19, which could pose you a few problems, paricularly in higher encounters.<br><br>Aside from that, I hope the feedback helps some.
