Right now thinking of doing it something like this Monk 6/Druid 15/Shifter 19.<br><br>With 6 levels of Monk, I can get KD/IKD for free (I think) and then with 15 levels of Druid, can get 8th level spells which can give me maximized Ice Storm (useful when shifted, since the shifted char *also* gets unlimited maximized Ice Storms then) and 19 levels of Shifter (so I can get as many shapes in there as possible).<br><br>What do you all think?  Does this spread make a degree of sense?  <br><br>Also thought maybe of a Druid/Wiz/Shifter build with also the idea of getting a maximized Ice Storm out of the deal, but on my PW, it seems like Wizards are very tough to level up on one's own ..<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Joe C.

Also you can get all possible shapes in this build, including the elder elementals. If you plan to play the OC and use the build with 6 levels of monk you usually take your last monk level at the end (lvl 37+), which means you won't get to use it in the OC anyway.

Otherwise going this route will result in stronger shapeshifting.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

If your Druid level will be higher than your Monk level, than take Druis at lvl 1.  If Monk lvl &gt; Druid lvl, then take Monk at lvl 1.<br><br>The reason behind this is that the Caster level of the Rak's Ice Storm is based on your class level of the class you chose at lvl 1.  (bug)  It is not based on your Druid or Shifter Level (unless of course Druid was your first class).
