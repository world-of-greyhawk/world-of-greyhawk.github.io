Half year, the Grim one was absent. His long wanderings of the land and his time crusading evil has finally come to conclusion and Grimnir is back in the Guild.<br><br>I'm back for all it matters and will do my best to get updated on everything that's happened. I will not be around daily anymore, like I was in my glory days, but couple of times pr week is what I aim for.<br><br>The reasons for my absense is many, and I will not dig into that. I haven't played NwN for a very long time now and will probably rarely play again, but might drop in from time to time. I'll be around the guild again though, and I've kinda missed it. I'll try to stop by a couple of times a week and do my moderating again when necessary.<br><br>Glad to see that the guild seems alive and well.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Hey, I post every now and then and I rarely play since about a year, no problem about that.<br><br>Updates? well, not much happened, if you need to know, Bromium is a Moderator now and he took over the Build Index, that's the most important thing that happened I guess.<br><br>Glad to have you back.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
