Here's a build I found somewhere and kept in my notes. I don't recall seeing this build here in the Guild so I thought I'd post it to garner feedback.<br><br>Critique away!<br>.........<br><br>Gandalf Character (Ftr7-WM7-Wiz26)<br><br>An excellent fighter/weapon master/wizard build<br><br><br>I don't think I've ever found a better "spellsword" build that was both excellent at melee, had good spells, and good defense even with cloth only. It's so good, I've been telling everyone about it.<br><br>Here's the build, quoted without permission:<br><br>Fighter 7/WM 7/Wiz 26<br><br>Race: Human<br>Base stat = 15 str, 14 dex, 14 con, 16 int, 8 wis, 8 char<br><br>Class Feat Bonus Feat Stat Value<br><br>Fgt 1 Dodge Mobility,P Attack<br>Fgt 2 Expertise<br>Fgt 3 Weaopn Focus<br>Fgt 4 Weapon Spec Str=15+1=16<br>Fgt 5<br>Fgt 6 Spring WhirlWind<br>WM1<br>WM2 Str=16+1=17<br>WM3 Improved crit<br>WM4<br>WM5<br>WM6 Toughness Str=17+1=18<br>WM7<br>Wiz 1<br>Wiz 2 Cleave<br>Wiz 3 Str=18+1=19<br>Wiz 4<br>Wiz 5 Greater Cleave Extend Spell<br>Wiz 6<br>Wiz 7 str=19+1=20<br>Wiz 8 Greater Str Str=20+1=21<br>Wiz 9<br>Wiz 10 Emp Spell<br>Wiz 11 Greater Str Str=21+1+1=23<br>Wiz 12<br>Wiz 13<br>Wiz 14 Overwhelm Crit<br>Wiz 15 Greater Int Str=23+1=24,<br>int=16+1=17<br>Wiz 16<br>Wiz 17 Epic weapon Focus<br>Wiz 18<br>Wiz 19 Str=24+1=25<br>Wiz 20 Devastating Crit Max spell<br>Wiz 21<br>Wiz 22<br>Fgt 7 Epic Weapon Spec Int=17+1=18<br>Wiz 23 Epic warding<br>Wiz 24<br>Wiz 25 Greater Int Int=18+1=19<br>Wiz 26 Epic Mage Armor,  pump str or int,<br>Int=19+1=20 or<br>Str=25+1=26<br><br>Summary<br><br>This build is extremely tight on feats, hence would not work with a sorc...because a wizard gets more feats.<br><br>In addition, WM requires an int of 13 anyways, and a wiz casting level 9 spells need 19...so there is some synergy there. Whereas if a sorc was used, there would not be enough attribute points to cast level 9 spells (chr. 19) and get devastating crit (str=25).<br><br>Specilise in greatsword, wear light armour or robe (no room for still spell feats) and you get a Gandalf type character. Able to fight in melee and cast level 9 spells with the 3 super epic feats...devastating critical, epic warding, and epic mage armor.<br><br>Buff yourself up and charge into battle, this guy is deadly, just like the real Gandalf.<br><br>[note: Personally, when I was playing around with this build, I went a little more into Int and Dex for better defense and fewer resists. I also took Spell Penetration and Spell Focus. So I went a little more mage with the feats and leaned more heavily on the fighter/WM levels alone for melee skills. I'd like to see Storm6 jump in and add his own comments. I'd love to see this build featured because I know I'm not the only one who yearns for the ultimate spellsword build.]<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 20:26</span></i></p>

It is possible to create a better spellsword - a very similar character who would also be able to cast spells in armor - thet's right, he will have auto still spell 3. I will post him very soon.

Not a bad build, but if you go Fighter 10/Wizard 23/WM 7 you get another feat.  Although you lose a few caster levels, it allows you to take more Fighter levels pre-epic, which gives you a better BAB.  If you go Fighter 9/Wizard 4/WM 7 pre-epic, you get a BAB of 28 at lvl 40, which is quite decent for an arcane caster.<br><br>As for not being able to find a better spellsword build, I have to disagree.  Personally, I think Mith's Magical Maruader build is a bit better, as it gets better saves and more feats.  <br><br>Alternatively, going Rogue 10/Fighter 8/Wizard 22 allows you to max Tumble for another +4 to AC.  In addition, you can pick up Improved Evasion and Uncanny Dodge.  You also get more skill credits, which is great because you also have more class skills, allowing you to raise skills like Hide and Move Silently for a stealthier mage, as well as Craft and Set Traps for a more stategic approach.  If that wasn't enough, you also get 5d6 sneak attacks, which is great when using Improved Invis, and if your enemy has True Seeing, you can always toss a Mord's to remove it.  <br><br>Also, it IS possible to wear armor without the Still Spell feat.  Just pump some points into Craft Armor (not sure how many exactly), and you should be able to create a Mithral chain shirt and an Ironwood shield, both of which have 0% arcane spell failure.

Oh well, my first build post and it's not even my own build. Whaddya gonna do?<br><br>Looking forward to more feedback. Dialogue is king!<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban.

with only 23 wiz it makes you 2ce as vulnerable to Dispell (with new system) i think.. since its 1d20 +caster level (max of +15) vs. 11+ targets caster level .. highest you can roll is  35 vs a 24 caster you need 1d20.. 5% chance of getting dispelled.. with 23 levels, 10% chance.<br>I've used this build a few months ago on a PvP server and it is quite effective, although you still get womped by other mages, only suggestion would be to take exotic weapon proficiency instead of weapon spec before level 6.. get a scythe..theres a feat in there you can get rid of i just cant think what it is at the moment heh
