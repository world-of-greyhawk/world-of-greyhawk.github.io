I am looking at a FTR/WPM/CLERIC build, possibly ftr-10,wpm-13,cleric-17 -or- ftr-10,wpm-15,cleric-15. The purpose is to build a decent fighter but to also provide a good survivable healer for the party. I dont need any level 9 cleric spells but having an epic spell such as epic warding might be worth it so that I can get that critical mass heal or resurrect off. What do people think is it worth it or take an extra 2 levels of WPM for better AB? <br><br>I haven't played a cleric in a long time so I am not sure the best spells, domains and feats to take so that I can maximize buffs. <br><br>Domains: I am currently thinking of healing to get an extra level of heals (5 + 6).<br>Feats: Meta-Magic feats: Silent spell (to get a third level (7) of heals if required, and Extend spell (to extend buffs).<br>Spells: I am not sure which spells to use and do they stack (i.e. Bless vs Aid vs Prayer).<br><br>Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>Regards,<br>Silent

If you want a healer and also be able to heal then 20cleric/4bard/16pm is your best bet. <br><br>A FTR/WM/Cleric template is only for self buffing and it has limited heals(4-5 heals) and that is just enough for yourself. It is stronger when it comes to fighting but i would say that the 20cleric/4bard/16pm wins over this build any day. Better DC's, defense and much better spell capability in general will give if a huge advantage.....immunne to crits as well ^^

I agree with, Kalmar, if healing is what you want to be doing for the party.  But I think you want to be able to melee as well. Personally its hard to go wrong with cleric-combos as there are so many but I like the 30cleric/10cot builds. Make sure to take at least four cot lvls pre-epic you can even give a up a lvl or two in the epics near character lvl. 40., for bard and get maxed tumble and umd...Rogue also would work here as well as monk for that matter. Remeber that cot gets g.wis as an epic feat so this will help your cleric focus on other things such as str or dex:) Look at this build as I think it is what you are looking for, It's the Torias battle cleric build:) <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117482", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br><br>Jim,(Fist.)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Fistdantilus-1 on 05/17/05 00:08</span></i></p>

Personally I think torias's idea with the lvl 40 cleric is alot more fun to play. If the server you play on have made it the heal spell to hell a number of HPs per cleric lvl, then 40 cleric is Uber. It has great spells and also great defense as well. It's very cool to play.

umm  *cough*  *looks at the cross around his neck.. OH i am a cleric*  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    <br><br>I am sorry to be vague, but the answers to your question is in how you want to play.  I say go to lv 19 with wm for extra feat and the ab, others say no highr than 7.  I say 10 ftr is too high.  For this type of build, 15 cleric is all you really need, but the restrictions wm puts on the build really strains your ability to be of help to the party (in a major way). If you want to be healer you should take wis to 20 (for slots) but then you are handicappin the melee side.  Its up to you.<br><br>As for domains :healin and .. good question!  Your cha is low (stats gone to wm qualify) cleric lv to low for others ..  id say Good.  <br><br>You mention that you want to be survivable for the party..  A very good build to do that is a dwarf ftr/cler/defender.  Why?  you only need 2 feats (dex 13) and toughness is great to have, so you can start with a decent wis and str.. and quite possibly a + modifier to charisma  WOOT!!  You really only need to take ftr to lv 5 (6 max if you make a mistake) 14 defender would give you 9/- reduction (if im not mistaken) and you could still have 20 lvls or cleric.  Put wis to 20 and put rest into str or con depending on what is more imprtnt to you.  Take max spell for the str (damage/ab) then still like you suggested for extra heals.  <br><br>To be honest, if you want a build that is one heck of a good time, AND IS NOT A DWARF, try the cleric23/ pal3/cot14 that was posted (sorry, dont remember by whom, but thanks a bunch.  Just found it and i am LOVIN it.  If you know whos this is, plz post a link to it!  i have lost it)<br><br>ANyway, i hope that helps.<br><br>Peace<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 05/18/05 07:49</span></i></p>

Hi Everyone, <br><br>Thanks for you replies. I have been mulling all your advice over but I guess the primary thing that I was looking for was a decent Fighter type a good attack bonus and some ability to do healing as well. <br><br>As a cleric with only  17 lvls and only a 19 wisdom his DC would not be very high but the self buffs and party heals do not need this. I do not plan to do a lot of offensive spells - he is trying to be a decent fighter after all <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> .<br>The healing will be available from lvl 5 spells (heal domain), lvl 6 spells (normal heal), lvl 7 spells (silent heal ) for a total of 12 (5+5+4)heals. I could also get mass heal from lvl 8 (normal) and lvl 9 (silent mass heal) for a total of 5 (3+2). <br><br>On of my concerns is that I will be spreading my stats too thin (Int=13, Dex=13,Wis=15 ==&gt; 19,Str=15 ==&gt; ??, Con=12, Cha=8).<br><br>After a test build it looks like I am not getting the number of feats that I would have liked. If I can't go very high in WM then it is really only giving me extended crit range. I am now thinking more of a FTR-16, Rogue-2,Cleric-22.<br><br>P.S. - On the server that I play on there are some very nice items for fighters but they require 10 levels in fighter to use them.<br><br>Silent
