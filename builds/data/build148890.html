This undead dwarf is practically untouchable by any standard means, laughing off even the most powerful of blows in his true form. Even his magical defenses are great, as he laughs in the face of the most terrifying of death spells and smirks at the most powerful mental assaults. His diety guards him from a vast cornucopia of spells beyond that, and only the strongest magical attacks stand the slightest chance. This dwarf makes so-called “dwarven walls” look like dandelions. He truly is a Juggernaut.<br><br>	(After I made this build I noticed a few that were similar, but I consider this particular build superior, or at least different, by a good margin, or else I wouldn’t bother to post it.)<br><br>Race: Dwarf<br>Alignment: LN<br>Starting Stats (Ending Stats) [Shifted Stats]<br>STR   14 [21]<br>DEX   14 (20)<br>CON   17 (21) [19]<br>WIS   14<br>INT   12<br>CHA   6 [8]<br><br>1  Druid-Dodge<br>2  Druid-<br>3  Druid-Toughness<br>4  Druid-+1 Con<br>5  Druid-<br>6  Druid-Alertness<br>7  Shifter-<br>8  Shifter-+1 Con<br>9  Shifter-Blindfight<br>10 Shifter-<br>11 Dwarven Defender-<br>12 Dwarven Defender-+1 Con, Weapon Proficiency: Exotic<br>13 Dwarven Defender-<br>14 Dwarven Defender-<br>15 Dwarven Defender-Weapon Focus: Scythe<br>16 Dwarven Defender-+1 Con<br>17 Dwarven Defender-<br>18 Dwarven Defender-Improved Critical: Scythe<br>19 Dwarven Defender-<br>20 Dwarven Defender-+1 Dex<br>21 Shifter-Epic Weapon Focus: Scythe<br>22 Shifter-<br>23 Shifter-<br>24 Shifter-+1 Dex, Epic Damage Resistance I<br>25 Shifter-<br>26 Shifter-<br>27 Shifter-Undead Shape<br>28 Dwarven Defender-+1 Dex<br>29 Dwarven Defender-<br>30 Dwarven Defender-Epic Damage Resistance II<br>31 Dwarven Defender-Epic Damage Resistance III<br>32 Dwarven Defender-+1 Dex<br>33 Dwarven Defender-Epic Skill Focus: Discipline<br>34 Dwarven Defender-<br>35 Dwarven Defender-Armor Skin<br>36 Dwarven Defender-+1 Dex, Epic Reflexes<br>37 Dwarven Defender-Max Tumble (20)<br>38 Druid-Spellcraft 40<br>39 Dwarven Defender-Epic Will<br>40 Dwarven Defender-+1 Dex, Epic Prowess, +1 Dex.

I was just reading that, although it isn't properly implemented, your DR is supposed to help with piercing through lesser DR. I have no idea if this is true, but if it is, and if the next patch fixes it, this build will be able to ignore any DR less than 24/-, or in other words every single build with less than 22 DwD, drastically increasing damage output against said builds. I thought that was pretty freakin' nifty.

Yes, I could stack an extra 30/+3 with Demonflesh Golem, which in theory would give me HUGE DR of 52/+3 against slashing and piercing, but for PvP you have to assume a +4 weapon, meaning I would be dropped back down to the original 24/-. Now, I wasn't sure if DR stacked or not, but the fact that it does makes the Risen Lord shape even more of a Juggernaut shape, because it offers 15/+5, meaning that anyone with less than a +5 weapon (which, excluding goofy high magic servers with +20 weapons, means quite a few people, because +4 is usually the maximum without spells/abilities. So I effectively have 78/+5 Physical Resistance against Piercing/Slashing, which I consider _much_ better than 52/+3.<br>Against a bludgeoning weapon, I have 39/+5 with Risen Lord, 54/+3 with Demonflesh Golem. So, there will be certain situations in which Demonflesh can take more damage, but, in PvP at least, they will be few and far between. (and chances are extremely high that 39 damage resistance + critical immunity will be all you need)<br>Also, the Demonflesh Golem is going to have (I think) less AB and smaller criticals (and maybe less damage output?), and most importantly, isn't going to have immunity to criticals, which enhances DR drastically. It will also be missing out on the cornucopia of Risen Lord immunities, the +5 weapon with +2 vampiric, and probably a few other things I'm forgetting.<br>That said, I heart Risen Lord.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

My reply had an error. You will only get 15/+3 or 24/- DR and 50% immunity to slash and pierce. don't get me wrong. This is a nice build as I pointed out earlier many people have similar ones already.

Seems like you have double the DR... in this case, you could say you do.  Now let's say you get hit for 100 (what's hitting you for this without a critical scares me, but hey), first it gets cut in half to 50, 25 of which is soaked.  You take 25 damage.  You soaked up 75 of it, not 50.  So in this case you have more along the lines of 75/- DR.

I was reading this post as Im strugling to finish my Risen Lord on a server im playing but, I noticed the arguement over damage and reduction is flawed.<br><br>In Risen shape if attacked by someone wielding a say +4 Longsword (slashing weapon) and SOMEHOW magically hitting for the before mentioned 100pts of damage then the actual working out would be 100damage less 50% (risen shape) 50left less 24 DwD reduction+epic damage reduction =26left and then it would also take off the 15 for +5 weapons so total damage taken would now be = 11 out of the initial 100. A very tough cookie to put down, what makes all the difference I find is to try getting enough damage resistance items or feats as the more powerful worlds will have weapons with Fire,Cold,electric,acid,negative and postive energy and maybe even sonic

It should also be noted that innate damage resistance (like that granted by the Epic Energy Resistance feats) stacks with damage resistance from items, but damage resistance from multiple items does not stack.<br><br>The DI/DR/DR thing is one of the most confusing implementations in NWN, in my opinion.

In PnP, you have DR x/y, which totals up with other DR to reduce certain amounts of physical damage, and you have Energy Resistance x, but the implementation is very poor on a whole scale.

Kail already explained it above, I wonder what's the confusion about.<br><br>Damage Reduction never stacks, the sole exception is Dwarven Defender's natural DR stacking with Barbarian's natural DR and Epic Damage Reduction, other than that, the one that resists the most amount of damage is the one that works (after taking into account the magical enhancement, if it breaches the highest resisting one then the next one kicks in). So Risen Lord's 15/+3 DR will never stack with another DR, no matter where it comes from.<br><br>The Risen Lord has, however, Damage Immunity slashing and piercing 50%, which does stack with Damage Reduction. Damage Immunity is always applied before Damage Reduction, so yes, it works like it was posted:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; <br>You don't have double DR against pierce/slash weapons either.

Sure, why not, you can call anything whatever you want, he got the name first and that's all it takes. The Damage Immunity + Reduction still makes you resist a lot.<br>_________________<br>Those who say money does not give happiness are just jealous of those who have money.
