This build is like a Divine spellcasting counterpart of an Exhalted Sorcerer; a Divine spellcaster with high DC and power, while the Exhalted Sorcerer uses Paladin to boost saves, this build uses Druid/Monk WIS synergy to boost AC, since he won't really be wearing armor, I decided Uncanny Dodge could come in handy to maintain the DEX AC, for which you will actually buff DEX, but I couldn't find much usefulness on other classes. His AC is quite decent and all except Barkskin bonus will stack when adding equipment, so it should be easy to increase.<br><br>Assassin was taken for skilldump + Uncanny Dodge without XP penalty, Rogue would give XP penalty and Shadowdancer or Dwarven defender require feats.<br><br>It's rather simple and easy to play, strong spells with high DCs and decent melee when shifted, with a considerably powerful Animal Companion.<br><br>The Druid is a powerful spellcaster after all, and I chose focus on 2 schools for a reason: Evocation since most of his damage spells are Evocation, so I want high damage applied, and Conjuration specifically to boost Storm of Vengeance's DC, a 10 round paralisis with the damage it brings along (max damage when failing save at all rounds is 60d6) can make wonders if the DC is high enough and enemy isn't immune, I love this spell, and you can place several storms for a perfect long lasting stun.<br><br>If that weren't enough he can cast a strong Empowered Ice Storm and Creeping Doom as no-save spells. Creeping Doom and Earthquake as no-spell-resistance spells, I didn't took Spell Penetration feats since he's got this no-SR spells and he can lower SR by 7d4 with Nature's Balance. He's also a good healer and summoner.<br><br>Playable Levels 1-40<br>PvM and PvP<br><br>Alignment: Lawful Netral -&gt; Neutral Evil<br><br>Human<br><br>Stats:<br>STR 8<br>DEX 10<br>CON 14<br>WIS 18 (36)<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8<br><br>1 Druid1 - Expertise, Improved Expertise<br>2 Druid2<br>3 Druid3 - Spell Focus: Evocation<br>4 Druid4 - WIS +1 (19)<br>5 Druid5<br>6 Druid6 - Greater Spell Focus: Evocation<br>7 Monk1<br>8 Druid7 - WIS +1 (20)<br>9 Druid8 - Extend Spell<br>10 Druid9<br>11 Druid10<br>12 Druid11 - WIS +1 (21), Empower Spell<br>13 Druid12<br>14 Druid13<br>15 Druid14 - Spell Focus: Conjuration<br>16 Druid15 - WIS +1 (22)<br>17 Druid16<br>18 Druid17 - Greater Spell Focus: Conjuration<br>19 Druid18<br>20 Druid19 - WIS +1 (23)<br>21 Druid20 - Epic Spell Focus: Conjuration<br>22 Druid21<br>23 Druid22<br>24 Druid23 - WIS +1 (24), Epic Spel Focus: Evocation<br>25 Druid24 - Armor Skin<br>26 Druid25<br>27 Assassin1 - Great Wisdom I (25)<br>28 Druid26 - WIS +1 (26)<br>29 Druid27<br>30 Druid28 - Great Wisdom II (27), Great Wisdom III (28)<br>31 Druid29<br>32 Druid30 - WIS +1 (29)<br>33 Druid31 - Great Wisdom IV (30)<br>34 Druid32 - Great Wisdom V (31)<br>35 Druid33<br>36 Druid34 - WIS +1 (32), Great Wisdom VI (33)<br>37 Druid35<br>38 Druid36 - Great Wisdom VII (34)<br>39 Assassin2 - Great Wisdom VIII (35)<br>40 Druid37 - WIS +1 (36)<br><br>Skills:<br>Concentration: 43<br>Spellcraft: 43 (45)<br>Tumble: 40<br>Use Magical Device: 42<br><br>Saving Throws (+9 vs spells):<br>Fortitude: 25<br>Reflex: 18<br>Will: 36<br><br>HP: 396<br>AC: 33 (10 Base +13 WIS +8 Tumble +2 Armor Skin)<br>BAB: 24<br>AB: +23<br><br>Spell slots: 6 9 8 8 8 8 6 6 6 6 <br><br>Buffed Stats:<br>HP: 476 (396 +80 Aura of Vitality)<br>AC: 56 (33 +2 Aura of Vitality +5 Barkskin +6 Owl's Insight +10 Improved Expertise)<br>AB: +29 (23 +3 Empowered Bull's Strength +2 Aura of Vitality +1 Blood Frenzy)<br><br>For melee effects, while shifted to Elder Earth elemental buffed AB is +42 (-2 size?) and HP is 636 but the shift might only prove useful to level up in PvM but not PvP wise.<br><br>The first build of the year, critics.

I'm just wondering where dragon shape is. Since your build can't fight in melee unless its shifted, it seems to be that you would benefit substantially from grabbing dragon shape.

There isn't much benefit from dragon shape actually, you can shift to fight in melee combat, but what's the point? this is a caster build, he's much stronger casting and his animal companion makes more than enough melee (and even a strong sneak attack if you take a Panther), if you take dragon shape you'll get a generic dragon with normal monk cheese bonuses, nothing impressive, If you want a dragon there are plenty of ways to make a better dragon.<br><br>Why would you want to melee anyway? it's just an option, it works fine in PvM if you don't want to rest often or when you're still low level, but at epic levels or in PvP he's <b>much</b> better as a caster: As I said, a total save-fail Storm of Vengeance can deal 60d6 (3d6 acid and 3d6 electrical per round for 10 rounds) with long lasting stun of 10 rounds, paired with Creeping Doom to take advantage of the stun, Firestorm deals 20d6 (10d6 fire, 10d6 divine) and it can be empowered, Ice Storm deals 17d6 (14d6 ice, 3d6 bludgeon) and can also be empowered, if you're lucky to find a low fort save enemy you can even try Finger of Death, damage per hit in dragon form can go up to 2d6+31, but that only if it hits and only to one enemy at a time, it's not worth it, you have to lose either epic spell focus or Great Wisdom (1 AC and 1 level 9 slot).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 01/01/07 22:01</span></i></p>

I'm just saying it seems like you're passing up a free power bump. Dragon shape might not be your primary option, but it seems like it would be more valuable than the +2 AC from Armor Skin if only for the versatility.

Hmm, I forgot I even had Armor Skin, must've been one the edits when I was making the build, since I had 3 focuses on the original version... that one might not be bad, take it if you want it, Armor Skin isn't such a significant loss but with the excessive size of the dragon and the power of the spells, I'll hardly ever use it.
