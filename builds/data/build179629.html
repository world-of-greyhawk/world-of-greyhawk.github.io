This was more of a "challenge build", to see if it could be done. If there is another way to get all the the below with these same classes, I havent seen it anywhere (and its always what people ask for):<br><br>9th level Sorc spells<br>Epic Spell (Epic Warding)<br>Auto-Still 3<br>DevCrit (Scimitar)<br>4 attacks/round<br><br>It matures a bit late for me, and will never be considered uber, but I can say it was fun to play!  Ironically, what turns people off the most is that it doesnt have the wings. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>I call it the "Seer of Torm":<br>Human 11/24/5 Pal/Sorc/RDD<br><br>Note: There are some modifications possible in this build in a lot of ways, even in classes. As an example, the last 3 levels can be of any of the three classes, and each combinaton has their advantage depending on what you are after. So dont look at me weird for taking 5 levels of RDD quite yet.  <br><br>Human<br>Str 16 (26)<br>Dex 8<br>Con 12<br>Wis 8<br>Int 14<br>Cha 16 (20)<br><br>1 Sorc PowAtk, Cleave<br>2 Pal<br>3 Pal Still Spell<br>4 Pal Str+1<br>5 Pal <br>6 Pal Divine Shield (possibly Extra Turning)<br>7 Sorc <br>8 RDD Str+1 <br>9 RDD GreatCleave<br>10 RDD<br>11 RDD<br>12 Pal Str+1(23) Divine Might (possibly Extra Turning)<br>13 Pal <br>14 Pal<br>15 Sorc ImpCrit(Scimitar)<br>16 Sorc Str+1(24)<br>17 Sorc <br>18 Pal EmpowerSpell (possibly Extra Turning)<br>19 Sorc<br>20 Pal Str+1(25) (Max Taunt, Discipline, etc)<br><br>At this point, he is 10/6/4 Pal/Sorc/RDD, and has 4 attacks/round. Armed and armored he is:<br>AC 21<br>AB 23/18/13/8 d6+7 damage unbuffed<br><br>21 Sorc OCrit(Scimitar)<br>24 Sorc Cha+1(17) DevCrit(Scimitar)<br>27 Sorc Expertise **(see note; could be anything)<br>28 Sorc Char+1(18)<br>30 Sorc Knockdown **(see note: could be anything)<br>32 Sorc18(9th level spells) Cha+1(19)<br>33 Sorc Auto-Still 1<br>36 Sorc Cha+1(20) Auto-Still 2<br>37 Sorc BonusFeat=Auto-Still 3<br>38 RDD5 (gains +2 natural AC)<br>39 Pal Epic Warding, Max Taunt, Discipline if desired<br>40 Sorc Str+1(26) Max Spellcraft, increase Tumble, etc<br><br>AC 26<br>AB 34/29/24/19 d6+8 damage unbuffed<br><br>Skills are variable, but I went with something like:<br>Concentration 20<br>Discipline maxed<br>Lore 8<br>Search 10<br>Heal 10<br>Spellcraft maxed<br>Taunt 30<br>Tumble 20<br><br>** One thing I'll point out now; you dont see Weapon Focus or Epic WFocus up there.  I chose to go without them, and use those feat slots to make me a better meleer in ways other than AB; ie Expertise and Knockdown. Those feat slots are available for lots of ideas of course, including Spell Pen feats, AB improvement feats, etc. And note that despite the documentation, WFocus is NOT required for OCrit or DevCrit. . . <br><br>The last 3 levels taken; you have choices, especially if you dont want a high Taunt. I had never had a Taunter, so I took Paladin near the end. Another route is to take 3 levels of RDD, which would still allow you to max Discipline, and also net a +2 to Con. Taking 3 Sorc levels instead would net you another bonus feat, and increase your Sorc power slightly.<br><br>You'll note I kept mentioning Extra Turning for certain feat slots; that would be an excellent alternative to take at any of those positions, boosting your Divine Might and Shield uses. Thanks to my use of Expertise, I rarely need Divine Shield, but like to keep it handy; thus all my turns are often devoted to Divine Might; but I felt I had enough, so I didnt take that feat. Your mileage may vary.  (Perhaps I should have skipped Divine Shield and took ImpExpertise. . .)<br><br>Well, there you are. I dont really think its "better" than the other existing Pal/Sord/RDD builds out there, but its another flavor, and may give some ideas. Getting 4 attacks/round with all that other stuff too was a nice challenge.<br>_________________<br>Normal kids play rock-paper-scissors.<br>Shifter kids play IronGolem-RustMonster-MindFlayer. . .
