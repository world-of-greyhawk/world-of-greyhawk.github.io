<b>Playable 1 - 40 PvM</b><br><br><i>In troll dens and ogre camps, scarred brutes gather near campfires in the dark nights of winter to share tales of adventures past. Many of these tales feature beautiful human women who cut down troll and ogre comrades with flashing swords or strumming longbows, both weapons wielded with equal deadly efficiency. <br>When the sun goes abed early and the cold winds blow daggers of ice through skin and cloak, bandits and ne'er-do-wells muster together in dim, smoky taverns to retell of past encounters. Many of their stories have skirmishes with the same ferocious sword-wielding and bow-wielding women.<br>Across the lands, all who follow dark paths lower their voices and look about cautiously when speaking of the terrifying Swordmaidens of Torm...</i><br><br>The idea behind this build was to put together a solid sword-wielder who could also wield a bow with skill. Although some may say an Elf would make a better sword &amp; bow fighter, I wanted to stay close to the idea of the Norse Valkyrie so I chose Human.<br><br>This character is not only a strong straightforward fighter, but she has a few tricks up her sleeves: <ul><br><li>Champion of Torm levels yielding +12 to all saves<br></li><li>Bard Song for +2 Attack, +2 Dmg, +1 All Saves, +8 HP, +1 Skill Bonus<br></li><li>Use Magic Device skill <br></li><li>Tumble skill (40) yielding +8 to AC<br></li><li>Taunt skill which can reduce an opponent's AC by 6 and cause spell failure of 30%<br></li><li>Called Shot feat which can either whittle down an opponent's strength, or slow down their movement speed, permitting an archer to gain more shots on-goal (Yes, "on-goal"! Forget duck season - it's hockey season!)<br></li><li>Epic Weapon Specialization in both Longsword and Longbow, adding total of +6 damage to each strike<br></li><li>Improved Knockdown to keep opponents down and unable to fight back<br></li><li>Improved Power Attack to add 10 points of additional damage to easy-to-hit opponents<br></li><li>Rapid Shot and Point Blank Shot to aid her archery<br></li></ul><br><br>Customizations one could make are to move points from Strength to Charisma, permitting some Bardic spellcasting as well as improving some CoT abilities. And of course, one could shuffle points between Strength and Dexterity as they like, to improve one attack over the other. I opted to focus on Strength and swordfighting, and make archery secondary. (Although one idea I had was to go Dex-based to empower the archery skills, and use Weapon Master levels to boost the Longsword attack. Perhaps that build will come another day...)<br><br>Suggestions, questions, and criticisms welcome.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban.<br><br><br>Classes:	Fighter 8/Bard 8/CoT 24	<br>Race:	Human	<br>Alignment:	Chaotic Good or Chaotic Neutral	<br>		<br>Stats	(Raise Dex at 11, 39, 40.

I (heart) this build<br><br>But I would prefer taking a couple points from STR and adding to CHA. Very nice

I like this build too, I think it's got a lot of potential for online party play where survivable melees with a side of support are always useful.<br><br>I'm not sure the ranged weapon flexibility does anything for me... you are spending a number of feats on it but in most situations I think this character would rather be in melee anyway - if not to take advantage of the higher AB, then in online situations where you'll want to be keeping bad guys off your squishies.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Nice build Kal. I like the focus in a ranged and melee weapon, actually. One could easily collect DEX-boosting gear to swap with STR-boosting gear as the situation warrants and maintain a good ranged attack.<br><br>Oddly, this build is reminiscent of something I've seen recently. Can't quite put my finger on it... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

This is admittedly an RP-ish build (Shh! Don't report me! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  ).<br><br>However; instead of the archery feats one could easily choose a second weapon to specialize in. For example, if one wanted to beat the unholy snot out of the undead, you could take Wpn Focus, Wpn Spec, Epic Wpn Focus &amp; Epic Wpn Spec in Heavy Flail and know that you have equal aptitude using either weapon (longsword or heavy flail).<br><br>Or, with some feat-juggling, you could take Exotic Weapons Proficiency, the 3 Dual Wielding feats, and then specialize in Katana and Dire Mace. For example:<br><i><br>Luck of Heroes -&gt; Exotic Weapons Proficiency<br>PBS, Rapid Shot and Called Shot -&gt; Ambi, TWF, Imp. TWF<br></i><br>That would make for one competent warrior, able to use any and all weapons.<br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br>What I'm reading now:<br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0874779405/103-5804382-8859066?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance" target="_blank">The White Spider</a> by Heinrich Harrer.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kaliban99 on 10/17/05 02:32</span></i></p>
