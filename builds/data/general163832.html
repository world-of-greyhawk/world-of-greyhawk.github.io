Hi everyone.<br>I'm looking for some input on a build I'd like to play : a Wizard / Eldritch Knight / PnP Shifter. I didn't put this thread in the build forum, as I have never fully tested this char (and thus, i don't have an exact level progression with feats). I know it is feasable, but I don't know if it's viable.<br>It would be a melee char, decent dex (16-18), low strengh (12-14), both boosted by the shifter shapes, dual-wielding but NOT finessed.<br><br>I was thinking of the following stats (final stats in parenthesis) :<br>Str 12<br>Dex 16 (18-19 for Perfect TWF)<br>Con 14<br>Wis 8<br>Int 16 (20-22)<br>Cha 8<br><br>Level progression would be along the lines of :<br>-Pre Epic-<br>Wizard 5<br>EK 2<br>Shifter 4<br>EK 8<br>Wizard 1<br>-Epic-<br>Shifter 10<br>Wizard 9<br>EK 1<br><br>Final levels :<br>Wizard 15<br>Eldritch Knight 11<br>Shifter 14<br><br>Keys feats :<br>Martial weapons (required for EK anyway)<br>Two-Weapon Fighting feats, and if possible, Two Weapon Defense<br>Extend spells<br><br>Pros :<br>-Two weapon fighting style with non light weapons<br>-Huge physical stats boosts from shifter shapes<br>-Nice immunities to effects and elements when required, from shifter shapes<br>-Epic spells (Caster level would be 26 without any feat)<br>-Arcane buffs without any armor-related problems<br>-Offensive arcane magic if required<br>-Many skills available, with a large skill selection<br><br>Cons :<br>-Very low AC (boosted a little by spells)<br>-Low HP (boosted a little by the shifter shapes)<br>-Very hard to level<br>-Few epic feats<br><br>Any comment ?<br>_________________<br>If you call IGMS, Harm, Mestil's acid shield, the Bigby hands or Devastating Critical balanced in your post, don't expect me to like you.<br><br>I'm sorry about my bad english, I'm french.<br>In every lie lies a part of truth.
