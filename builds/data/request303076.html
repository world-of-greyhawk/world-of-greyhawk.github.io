Thank you for the chance to take part in this active and interesting guild. I would like to make my first post a challenge to Grizzled Dwarflord who is one of my favourite builders. All others are welcome to make contributions to this thread but the theme fits him to a "T" and I'd like his input...<br><br>I am looking for a strong Dwarven Cleric build who can mix it up in the front lines and provide healing and buffing at the same time. Knowing the resilience of dwarves this should be a drinking have fun kind of character who can mix it up, take a beating, and still drain a few kegs after the day is through.<br><br>The requirements are a serviceable ab and ac, meaning he can solo if he needs to and make dwarves everywhere proud with his success. A strong spell presence with decent degree of undispellable would be appreciated. To be honest I was thinking of something like maybe... <br><br>26 cleric, 10 Dwarven Defender, and 4 levels of monk to make a high wisdom advantageous to spells and AC... This opens up the zen archery if that makes it more feasible. But to take words from Dwarflord's Rune Scarred build Clerics are "Diesel Driven" and can toe to toe with best of them. This fellow however will be "Ale Driven" and happily so...<br><br>Another thought I had was going mostly cleric and getting enough CON for Epic DR. I do feel that the build might benefit more from some warrior class levels but of course the right build would prove me wrong.<br><br>The challenge is set... All are welcome to join in...<br><br>Looking forward to all contributions.... Thanks in advance... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.

Thanks gentlemen, both are good builds and worth consideration. I may just have to retract the monk idea as maybe it's not quite my style. Had a monk/defender once, only fought with fists and he ended up doing alright. I Rp'd him off as a bar brawler somewhat a drunken master of sorts. He was fun to play but my dwarves tend to be a bit more warrior drinking types and less dwarf meets Kain and puts the grasshopper in his ale mug and quaffs it all down.... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>I had seen both of these builds on the build search and considered both I might add. I constantly peruse the build search engine for nifty ideas for new characters. <br><br>Cinn, yours is interesting, how would approach making a more cleric focused build without losing a bunch of the melee potential? I must admit when I saw your build I didn't think about trying to tweak it for that good cleric flavour.<br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Nestrial Darkfalcon on 11/10/08 03:22</span></i></p>

Of course, it's really hard to make a bad cleric.  He's got the low Dex and Reflex save to represnet his penchant for inebriation.  He's got the high Con to represent his capacity for drinking everyone under the table.  With a decent AC, Improved Invis, Oodles of HP and Damage Reduction, he should be able to outlast everyone around him, and heal himself spontaneously with little fear of disruption thanks to his high Concentration score, and his huge Listen (or Spot) score helps to keep him Backstab-free.  He's not a caster cleric, but more of a meleer-tank cleric who can swing a hammer and slosh a tankard at the same time, and keep a lazy eye on his comrades in case they fall.<br><br>Cheers, lad.  Thanks for the post.  Ended coming up with an off-the-wall yet playable build.  The hard part was coming up with the 3rd class.  Fighter is a no-brainer when going for EDRs, but we needed something for Tumble to give him that up-front presence in combat where he can wheel about in an unpredictable drunken careening.  It's hard to do that when you go Fighter/Cleric because the 3rd class has to be a PrC or face the XP penalties.  That left Assassin, SD and Harper.  Assassin doesn't make sense, and SD required 13 Dex (not cool), which left Harper.  The Harper's Cat Grace covers his 8 Dex and gives him just enough to get 1 to 2 AC while wearing Full Plate.  Also allows for some ESFs in Epic along with the Tumble and Listen drops, and it suddenly fits.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 11/10/08 06:14</span></i></p>

I think most people are pretty happy with the KD feats, but if I were to play it I would be tempted to drop them to go over the top with HPs and take Toughness and Improved Crit: Hammer, or Toughness and Expertise (to make him last forever in melee), or Silent Spell and Toughness, or Silent Spell and Craft Wand.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Thanks alot guys!!! I'm glad I finally joined the guild. It's good to interact with you as I have admired your work for some time. <br><br>Cinn, that looks good... I may have to do some build testing of each build and see which one fits my style both play and RP-wise. <br><br>Dwarflord, thanks alot man... Between your stories and some of your builds that I have enjoyed using I have to say I am glad you jumped at the challenge. <br><br>Thax, thanks to you too, hopefully I didn't rub you the wrong way first time you answered one of my posts. The Dwarven Abomination, that's a bit more like my style I think. I don't remember where I saw your Lethal Kama Dwarf but I know I found it as a result of build searching whether it was a thread in another build discussion or maybe a reference somewhere.<br><br>It's nice to see that some of the "Big Guns" of the guild are still around offering up cool builds for people like me that don't make the best one ourselves.<br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.

DOH!  The logic is this, you get the martial feat for FREE with fighter, so why take that feat as a cleric?  Instead, move ONE lvl of fighter to lv 1 or 2.  Much more efficient.<br><br>next, 3 levels of rogue?  what does 3 lvls of a class that GIVES YOU XP PENALTY give that a prc class cant (which WONT give you the penalty)?<br><br>With a cleric, and this has been discuissed ad nosium on this forum, imvho, you should stay at 3/5 ab progression thru lv 20.  Casting div fav + div power gives you 10 to ab, and div power gives you +5 to each attack OR 3 with the 4th at FULL ab.  IF you want to do ftr/clr pre, make it 17c.3 ftr and you still get the 4th at full ab.<br><br>because you are not a str cleric, the expt/imp expt imho are wasted feats.  With a cleric, when you go imp expt you loose 10 and can gain 10 so you are essentially the same ab-wise, BUT the ab needs all the boosting you can get.  Its up to you, but with a cleric, you will find that expertise isnt really needed.<br><br>Another rookie mistak (i did it in my builds early on too) is to WASTE epic feat slots on pre-epic feats.  What does zen archery give you at lv 36?  at that point, you will find that you have become so imbedded in castin and killin that a long range attack will never occur.  You are a DWARF!  Get in and fight.  Called shot... leave it for the bowers, imo.  i have NEVER used that feat in my 5 years of playing.<br><br>Why do you end the build with 2 rogue?  At that point you are far too long to gain much (and have put up with xp penalty for what?).  Most people, when building with this kind of combo, use Rogue for SKILL dumps.  When you do this, the norm is to put them at lv 7, 12, 17, etc.  why?  when you start a char you get lv+3 to max a skill.  At lv 7, you have max skil of 10.  Most people are lookin (from rog) for Tumble boosts to ac.  Taking more than *0 (with a dex of 10) is waste.  <br><br>Stats..  dex, leave at 8!  You are in full and tower.  that gives 1 to con, 17 con means you have one fewer to worry about later on.   <br><br>22 wis vs 20 wis or even 19 wis doesnt give much difference.  You are not a caster cleric (otherwise you would have wis 30+).  <br><br>in my opinion, you are trying to be a jack of all trades, master of none.  Clerics do this really well.  The secret of clerics though, is they are godly without trying to be.  It appears you are trying to make a Damage sink!  One where he can take a lickn and keep on fighting.   So, stick to that theme!  Pump con as much as possible!  Take Epic toughness (and toughness (WHAT YOU missed the essential dwarf feat!!). <br><br>FOr your tumble class, look to assassy, or Harper scout!!  ohh that might be fun.  OR, look to replace fighter with COT, makin cleric/cot/rog3.  COT is a nice cleric option because their bonus feats in epic open gr wisdom (for a caster cleric option).  YOu wont get epic ws nor ws, but i never missed them!  Though with non-str cleric, it sounds like a good option.<br><br>I hope i have opend your eyes alittle.  there is more to building but i think i have covered some basics...  next<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Well, avado covered most of the issues here, I'll add that Clerics don't use Zen Archery unless you're a spellcaster heavily WIS-based, Darkfire alone makes me grab a weapon and forget the bow, you'll notice how true that is after a while. Called Shot is not that useful for meleers, take Knockdown instead, it's better. But don't listen to everything avado said, Harper Scout is a BAD idea, you need to waste 2 feats to qualify for Harper Scout, so forget it. Replacing Fighter with Champion of Torm is something I wouldn't advice, Epic Weapon Specialization is quite useful, at least I prefer it. On the other hand, Assassin is nice to avoid XP penalty, the skill requirement is not that heavy.<br><br>I've got to say, I don't like your stat distribution, it's very awkward, I mean why 22 WIS? is there a reason? any? your combat stat is STR, so increase it as much as possible when your other stats are done, 19 WIS and 21 CON is all you need for spells and EDR, any further is worse than raising STR. <br><br>If it were my build I'd drop DEX to 8 and INT to 12 to start with 18 CON, start raising WIS up to 19 and then CON, you will get 21 CON at level 24 without wasting an epic feat for Great CON and you will also be able to take EDR starting at level 24. After you take Epic Focus, Prowess and Specialization, leave all the rest for Great STR and you should be able to end with about 20 STR (the build I mentioned ends with 22 STR, and it's harder to manage stats there as you can't lower DEX on a DwD, so your build spread should be capable of more STR as it has a good deal of Fighter levels to take bonus feats freeing regular feats for Great Strength). But that's only if you want your build to hit harder, even if the build is thought as a tank, STR is your melee combat stat, so raise it man.<br><br>Also, once you reach epic levels and good enough spells, it's more important to take Fighter levels fast for epic bonus feats, since epic Cleric levels won't give you almost any power as a buffer. I would even lower Cleric to 23 and raise a bit more Fighter instead just so you can take all the EDRs in bonus feats and net a higher amount of Great STR.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 05/09/08 07:26 (GMT) -- avado<br><br>THax, you know i love and respect you, right?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 11/21/08 01:42</span></i></p>

Fighter isnt his problem here with the XP penalties, as it is the favored class of Dwarves, so the Cleric/CoT/Rogue split wouldnt solve that problem. I realize that it is very tempting for every build to have some Rogue dump levels, but it isnt always needed. I think the Harper Scout could be interesting. Maybe a Cleric 25/Fighter 10/Harper Scout 5 split? I dont picture this guy as being Evil, so I wouldnt consider the Assassin route. I would probably just forget the Rogue levels and go Cleric 26/Fighter 4/CoT 10, but thats just more my kind of build. If XP penalties dont bother you, you should atleast go Cleric 26/Fighter 10/Rogue 4 and spread out the Rogue levels at say levels 7, 17, 27, and 37. Thanks for sharing your build.

In my experience. clerics are plenty poweful enough to eat an XP penalty without blinking.  In the case of a dwarven cleric, I think it's worth it.  That said, I would take far fewer fighter and rogue levels.  2/3 is probably ideal.  I'd also hold off on that first rogue level until at least 22nd.  This is, of course, influenced by the environment in which I play, but, I'm just sayin', if anyone can eat an XP penalty, it's a dwarven cleric...

Thanks guys,<br><br>I knew my build would get alot of suggestions as I am truly not a good builder. My first few years playing NWN I was one of those roleplayers that built for theme forgot about power and playability. Now as I keep playing I find myself struggling to find more ability to solo as some pw's are not so plentifully populated as they once were. I also find that I can enjoy soloing areas that I feel I can handle after a long day at work.<br><br>With that said, thank you for the suggestions, I will try to learn from my mistakes. I have raided the build search engine for good builds to play solo but find myself wanting to be able to create them myself. Between learning to build and getting more strategic at soloing it will be a challenge.

For anyone but full plate tanks, this is plenty of gold to get going.  For full plate wearers, you're just going to have to start w/ half plate until you can get some more gold in your pockets.

And it seems that several of this guild's members play there. That's a plus, kinda feel like I know some of you already.<br><br>I may just have to check it out. I saw the death penalties weren't outrageous either. That's a plus when going somewhere you haven't played, because Murphy's Law states that you'll find the one hit one kill critters by accident. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"><br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.

WoG gives new meaning to "death is part of life."  Even once you know what to expect, you're still gonna take some dirtnaps.  I suppose that's a big part of what we like.  It aint no cakewalk.
