Hey all,<br><br>I feel guilty of saying that, but NWN is getting boring. I've completed all OCs more than once with many different characters without much trouble (not counting the dragons in  the first campaign and the Maker in HotU) and have played a couple of mods from NWVault, but I've really grown sick of playing alone. <br><br>I've been playing on an Action PW for quite some time now but even that is getting awfully boring... It's a High-magic world with no scenario at all (except for a "get me that gansta's head, you get much bling-bling" thing) and after lvl25 it takes ages to level.<br><br>What I'm looking for now is a fun to play, scenario-based,  role-player friendly and not socially intimidating mid-magic PW where I won't have to play 24 hours a day for a year to see the light of the 30th levels..<br><br>I know it may be asking for much, but please, help this bored little kid get a grip over himself before he quits NWN!!!<br><br>Thanks!<br>Saosin777

Sounds like you're ready for a RP server, to get more depth to your playing experience.<br><br>I play a lot on 3kds.  <a href="http://www.3kds.com/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.3kds.com/index.php</a><br>It's low/mid magic with max +3/+4 items in the shops. CNR crafting and mastercrafting. Items are customised to give save bonuses instead of immunities (there's no autofail on 1). <br>The server is reset several times daily, so you can do the quests quite often. There's much DM activity and LOTS of players, many of them really good roleplayers. There are many active guilds of different alignments. <br>There are rules that promote the RPing aspect of the game. Some of them put restrictions on what character builds are possible. As an experienced roleplayer I'll say the rules make sense.<br>The PW is on Game Spy's roleplaying page. No password, but have a look at the server's homepage before you start playing.<br><br>Edit: Oh yes, you can get all the way to lvl 40. There are many epic characters there. But if you roleplay your way up into epic levels you might realize that you had just as much fun at the lower levels.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 11/11/05 08:59</span></i></p>

I paid a visit to their website today and it looks great. Seems to be exactly what I had been looking for. I've registered an account and started a character I've been wanting to rp for a long time, so it looks like I'll be having lots of fun.<br><br>Thanks man! Maybe we'll get to see each other there! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
