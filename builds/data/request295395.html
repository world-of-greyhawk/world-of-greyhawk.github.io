Does anyone know a good build for a druid/shifter(doesn't need to have shifter) that mainly uses the forms like the panther, wolf, etc? <br>I've been trying to come up with one, but I'm not exactly the best at planning builds out. The build can't have any monk levels either. Is it even possible to have a decent build like this?

Most likely possible. Have you looked <a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank"> here </a> yet? There are plenty of druid/shifter/X builds, 66 in fact. Well 46 after the 20 with monk levels are out. <br><br><br><br><br><br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"><br>_________________<br>Spirit, It is the hero's strength, the mother's resilience, and the poor man's armor.

For forms like Panther and Wolf you won't be needing Shifter, it gets you cool forms but none from animal types.<br><br>Any heavy Druid build matches your description, Dire animal shapes are attained with 12 Druid levels, and Druid is a good caster overall so it's a playable build.<br><br>Since you're not taking Monk, raising WIS will only serve for spells, and if you don't want to play an offensive caster then you can leave it at 19 and raise any stat you like, depending on your other classes.<br><br>If you want to be shifted for fighting, I'd recommend Cleric or Paladin for buffs (or both). <br><br>Another way is to use sneak damage, Assassin works great because you can pump up INT as much as you want for Death Attack DC since your combat stats are defined by the shape, I'd take a level of SD for HiPS for a sneak build.<br><br>Rogue or Shadowdancer to get Epic Dodge works too, animal shapes aren't too strong so ED can make up for it.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Thanks you two. Hopefully I'll be able to find what I'm looking for now.
