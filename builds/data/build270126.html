note:<br>i've tried the build with ten levels of shadowdancer, too.<br>when you are not pushing for lasting inspiration, this is the way to go.<br>you'll have to take weapon proficiency: martial and will get weapon finesse at level 18.<br>you'll end up with something like Bard14/WM16/SD10 with much better AB and more dex (grizz has done this).<br><br>however, my bards have lasting inspiration.<br>in that case rogue is better, since hips is by no means essential to this character, and you gain 7d6 sneak and more skillpoints.<br>the bonus feat from something like bard23/SD10/WM7 would get negated by the fact that you can't wield handaxes without proficiency.

Hmmm...I think there's a reason this class combo hasn't been used.  How exactly are you planning on dealing damage?  You're dex based, with 8 strength for a -1 penalty.  You don't have Fighter for EWS.  You don't really have very much Sneak damage, and what little you have lacks a good way to deliver it (no HiPS, no KD/IKD, no Invisibility/Darkness spells).  Maybe in a high-magic setting where you can get plenty of +damage on your weapon it would do alright, but even then, your mediocre AB will hurt you.<br><br>I think this build shows why:<br><br>A.  Dex builds need some way to add damage to their attacks.<br><br>B.  7 WM isn't worth the feat investment, especially without Fighter or CoT levels.<br><br>Props for making a build that hadn't been done before, but unfortunately I don't think it's going to be very effective.

bard song, bull's strenght and warcry add some damage.<br>as i said this build only becomes powerful in a high magic environment where weapons have damage boni.<br>but there it works just fine, since the majority of damage does not come from strenght, even when strenght based.<br>this is not a server specific build in general, cause there are a lot high magic servers out there, considering HotU-Items extremely high magic.<br><br>i've just tested it in the novice to epic character maker.<br>with +12 strenght from items, bard-buffed and a handaxe with +15 bludgeoning and +15 massive criticals he managed to do crits in the 160's.<br><br>my fighter with 30 strenght using an equal one-handed weapon with x2 multiplier can't do that.<br><br>that's why i see a lot of people building dex based weaponmasters when there are good weapons available.<br><br>well, just trying to defend my build. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 04/04/07 23:12 (GMT) -- Nimueh_Leafbow<br>A.

The problem I see with depending on high-magic weapons for damage is that this build's AB just isn't up to snuff, and environments that have +15 damage and +15 massive crits on weapons are also going to have some pretty damn high AC mobs (and plenty of big AC boosts available to players, if you're doing PvP).<br><br>Even assuming +12 dex, +20 to hit, and including the -5 penalty from Curse Song, this build caps at +70 AB.  The standard human str-based fighter/WM/(tumble class) will hit +79 in the same environment (a more feat-starved and attribute-starved Half-Orc can get to +80), and if he's partied with a bard, he'll hit a de facto +84 (85) from his party member's curse.  A dexer will be even higher, and archers will, of course, be higher still.  In a setting where such AB values are achievable, I don't see many realm designers letting you hit very often with a +70.  And if you can't hit, your crit stats don't matter at all.<br><br>Maybe I'm wrong about the nature of servers; obviously, I haven't played on all of them, so there could be some where the magical environment is such that you can get huge +damage but still have mobs with low enough AC that you can hit them and get your chance to crit.  I haven't seen one, though.

I think this build is cool. Yes, the playability is debatable, but I'm willing to consider this a genius theme build - wouldn't be the first one posted <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  How the name rolls off your tongue is especially neat, "Singing Sushimaster," that should be made a movie <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"><br>_________________<br>" -- They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then it's night once more."<br><br> - Pozzo in Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett
