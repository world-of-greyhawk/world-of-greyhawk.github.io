I had something happen today that I thought wasnt supposed to occur!!   I was making a quick run of a pally cot.. with 4 lvl of ftr.. my intention was to make a high charisma meleeist.   I took 4 ftr lvls for wpn spec (bastard sword)  then 16 pally.  At lv 21 I took CoT and ewf (bastard sword).  taking the next lvls in CoT at lv 22 (cot bonus feat) i had the option to take epic wpn specialization.  I thought it was ONLY open to fighter class?  Is this a glitch?  <br><br>any info is greatly appreciated<br><br>Peace

I think it's because you took WS with your fighter so at epic levels you also get EWS.<br>_________________<br>NW

Actually I think you can get both WS and Epic WS With CoT. Seems as CoT gains the classfeat of Fighter.

Cot can take EWS if WS is already taken with fighter levels. CoT can NOT take WS on it's own.<br><br>K.<br>_________________<br>Check out the Epic Character Builders Guild<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Test your new builds in this mod:<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/modules/data/1073117317280.shtml" target="_blank">Click Here</a>
