Open lock is a take 20 skill. So you need a +100 skill modifier. <br><br>Rogue and assassin have open lock as class skills giving a max rank of 43.<br>The skill is modified by dexterity. With a high dex (20 +10 + great dex10 = 40(bard, AA and assassin have great dex as an epic bonus feat)), you can get a max skill bonus of 15.<br>The feats skill focus and epic skill focus will add 13.<br>This adds up to 71.<br><br>A lvl 30 bard song will improve your skills with +19 (but you'll need a perform skill = 100)<br>A cleric with the trickery domain, will get 1 bonus to the skill every 2 lvls with divine trickery active.<br><br>A dex based cleric/rogue(or assassin) should be able to get close to open lock + 90 without items.<br><br>Maxed dex items (+12 dex) will add +6 to the skill. Items with + to open lock should help you hit the +100 mark.<br><br>This is not an exact build, only some ideas, but I hope it can be of some help.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

Sorry, I don't have a full build for you..but here are my thoughts.<br><br>I play on a low magic world named Gemstone.  I have a cleric/rogue picker build that can hit DC110 in the three skills.<br><br>33Cleric/5Rogue/2Monk<br>This is a robe-style cleric with high wisdom.<br>Have to have 5 rogue to join rogue's guild to use some items.<br><br>16 INT and 16 DEX by 40 to make it easy on my gear requirements.<br>Then all my picking gear + cats/foxs potions + divine trickery.  I can hit 110 no prob.  Probably 120 with a little tweaking.<br><br>The main thing people would need to know to help you is how many points come from your gear.

Is there no gear available on your PW that adds to open Lock (Rogue Gloves, Amulet of the Master, etc.)? Can you get lockpicks?<br><br>If +10 lockpicks are available, then you only need to hit 90 with your modified Open Lock skill.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Okay, a couple things:<br><br>1) Can you get lockpicks? If so, what's the best you can get?<br><br>2) What items can you get that have +5 DEX on them? (Wondering how many you'll be able to wear all at once in order to figure out how close you can get to max DEX with items only)<br><br>3) Do you want this character to be only a lockpicker, or do you want him to be able to fight as well?<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Okay, here's what I can suggest off the top of my head:<br><br>Halfling Cleric 18/Bard 18/Rogue 4<br><br>Start with 20 DEX and take 6 GRT DEX feats. That will give you 36 finishing DEX. Assuming you can max your DEX with items/spells, you'll have 48 DEX. This gives you +19 on your Open Lock skill.<br><br>Max Open Lock = 43<br>Skill Focus:Open Lock = +3<br>Epic Skill Focus:Open Lock = +10<br>Bard Song boost = +6<br>Trickery domain power = +9<br>DEX bonus = +19<br><br>Total = 43+3+10+6+9+19 = +90. If you can get +10 lock picks and take 20, you get 120.<br><br>Your last level must be Rogue to max Open Lock.<br><br>This character will need to save skill points to do a point dump, and will be pretty gimped in other stats, but he can do it. You <i>must</i> be able to get those lock picks though. I'm not sure you can build a character that can pop a 120 DC lock without using lockpicks or skill-boosting gear.<br><br>I'll give it more thought to see if I can come up with something better.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

You do have room for 2 more great DEX.  So, that would give you another +1, raising the best lock you can pick to 117.  To be honest, I don't think 120 is possible without better lockpicks than +3.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 09/24/05 22:59</span></i></p>
