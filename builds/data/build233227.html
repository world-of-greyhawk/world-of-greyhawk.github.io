This is a party support build. Get all the buffs you need in one compact package. Can cast all Cleric Buffs, all Bard buffs, fully powered Bard Song/Curse Song, War Domain for Aura of Vitality, Healing Domain for Empowered Healing. This would make a poor solo character, but will seriously pump up any party she is in. <br><br>She can go well over the +20 cap for herself, and can buff the party with +4 to Str, Con, Dex, and an effective +18 for the entire party with Aid, Bless, Battletide, Prayer, Bard Song/Curse Song, and Taunt. If the party does not already have +5 or better weapons, she can use GMW for another +5 as well (including the Str buff, that's an effective +25, with only +12 counting towards the magic AB cap!). Not to mention the damage bonuses from Song, Darkfire, etc., and the skill bonuses as well (makes her Taunt more effective, and helps the party with IKD, Disarm, and resisting the same from the enemies).<br><br>I found 2 similar builds in the search engine:<br>Support Corssbow Master (Cleric 20 Bard 16/ Barb 4): <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "164883", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Ancilla (Cleric 17/Bard 20/ Sorc 3): <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "128675", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Here is the build:<br>Cleric(23), Bard(17), Human<br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 12<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 14 (26)<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 14 (16)<br><br>Hitpoints: 366<br>Skillpoints: 249<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 23/32/20<br>BAB: 25<br>AB (max, naked): 29 (melee), 34 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 21/32<br>AB (fully self-buffed): 53/48/43/53 (melee), 54/54 (ranged)<br>AB (+12 to Str/Wis): 55/50/45/50 (melee), 60/60 (range)<br>Skills: Concentration 43(45), Discipline 43(43), Perform 32(35), Spellcraft 43(45), Taunt 25(28), Tumble 40(41), UMD 23(26)<br><br>L01: Cleric(1): Extend Spell, Combat Casting, Domain War, Domain Healing, Cl: (Turn Undead)<br>L02: Cleric(2)<br>L03: Cleric(3): Weapon Focus: Mace<br>L04: Cleric(4): WIS+1, (WIS=15)<br>L05: Cleric(5)<br>L06: Bard(1): Curse Song, Ba: (Bard Song, Bardic Knowledge)<br>L07: Bard(2)<br>L08: Cleric(6): WIS+1, (WIS=16)<br>L09: Cleric(7): Empower Spell<br>L10: Cleric(8)<br>L11: Cleric(9)<br>L12: Bard(3): WIS+1, Lingering Song, (WIS=17)<br>L13: Cleric(10)<br>L14: Cleric(11)<br>L15: Cleric(12): Zen Archery<br>L16: Cleric(13): WIS+1, (WIS=18)<br>L17: Bard(4)<br>L18: Cleric(14): Blind Fight<br>L19: Cleric(15)<br>L20: Cleric(16): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br>L21: Cleric(17): Epic Weapon Focus: Mace<br>L22: Bard(5)<br>L23: Cleric(18)<br>L24: Cleric(19): WIS+1, Epic Prowess, (WIS=20)<br>L25: Cleric(20)<br>L26: Cleric(21)<br>L27: Bard(6): Armor Skin<br>L28: Cleric(22): WIS+1, (WIS=21)<br>L29: Cleric(23): Improved Combat Casting<br>L30: Bard(7): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=22)<br>L31: Bard(8)<br>L32: Bard(9): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br>L33: Bard(10): Great Wisdom II, (WIS=24)<br>L34: Bard(11)<br>L35: Bard(12)<br>L36: Bard(13): CHA+1, Great Wisdom III, (WIS=25), (CHA=15)<br>L37: Bard(14)<br>L38: Bard(15)<br>L39: Bard(16): Great Charisma I, (CHA=16)<br>L40: Bard(17): WIS+1, (WIS=26)<br><br><br>Options: You can drop UMD to max Taunt if you want to be able to Taunt spellcasters (I left UMD just high enough to use the best monk boots). As is, you will be able to taunt all non-spellcasters quite effectively, but probably will fail against spellcasters (although with Song/Curse Song active, you have a slight chance even against them). You could drop 3 levels of Cleric and 2 points of Wis to reach Bard 20 and take Lasting Inspiration. You could drop Wis to 20 to pump Str, but since DP raises it to 18 anyway, I didn't think that was worthwhile.<br><br>Domains: War is a must for Aura of Vitality. I picked Healing for party support. Trickery, Magic, Knowledge, are all made redundant by the Bard levels. You could take Plant if you want to cast Creeping Doom and Barkskin, or one of the elements if you want to turn elementals, or Good if you want to turn outsiders. Str would give her another Str boost and earlier DP, but Don't do much for the party.<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 05/28/09 18:25</span></i></p>

I tend to favor Cleric over Bard because I find the high level Cleric spells more useful than the high level Bard ones. Also, it gets hard to pump Perform high enough to use the full song above level 20, and you don't gain that much from it compared to level 16 anyway.<br><br>Like I said, I would consider 20/20 to get Lasting Inspiration (that is quite nice), but I think I'd prefer 23 Cleric over 23 Bard.<br><br>TM

Those are some buffs....<br><br>It does get all cleric spells, so it can also work as a caster, not awesomely powerful, but 23 cleric is decent if your enemy doesn't has very high SR.<br><br>Sure is made for party enhancing, but it would still survive alone, using the self buffs it gets strong, and +60 ranged AB sure is good, might work better ranged/casting than melee, maybe WF and EWF on a bow, or also Exotic Weapon for composite bows.<br><br>If you're not convinced that it's good alone, make some summons and buff them to pretend you are in a party.<br><br>17 uses of the bard song should be well enough.<br><br>Nice build.

Quick modification to improve ranged AB:<br><br>Take Weapon Proficiency: Martial at level 1.<br>Move Extend Spell from level 1 to level 3 (replacing WF: mace). <br>Move Zen Archery up to level 9.<br>Take WF:Longbow at level 15.<br>Move Empower Spell to Level 18.<br>Take EWF:Longbow at level 21 instead of EWF:Mace.<br><br>You lose WF/EWF:Mace and Blindfight. You get Zen Archery earlier, and pick up +3 to your ranged AB (now 37), and get 3 or 4 ranged attacks instead of 1 or 2 (now 37/32/27 unbuffed, 63/58/53/63 fully buffed, not counting the -5 to enemy AC from Curse Song or -6 from Taunt). <br><br>Losing Blindfight isn't that bad for her since she can cast True Sight. The only time it will hurt is against enemies with SC V or Empty Body. <br><br>This would make her less effective at melee, but more effective at shooting arrows from behind the fighters she has buffed up, which is where I would expect her to try to stay most of the time.<br><br>TM

I often find it is better to use a light crossbow with Clerics, rather than a bow...you get to wear a shield which you can have at a minimum of +5 with magical vestament...however you'd have to take it off to cast bard spells <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cry.gif">  ...+ with all those spare 1st level spells you can bless a stack of bolts and on-hit kill Rakshasa's <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"><br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!

Okay, so let's consider the the Weapon FOcus feats to be your choice - she has room for a WF:(any simple) and a EWF:(any simple). I will also leave Blindfight optional if you want to have her take Martial Weapon Prof, Rapid Shot, etc. It only makes a difference of 3 AB, and since this build does not focus on her AB anyway, it's not terribly important. <br><br>She'll cast all of the long-duration buffs on the whole party after every rest. In combat, she'll be popping off Songs, Curse Songs, Taunts, and short-duration group buffs while her fighters tear up the enemy. By the time she finishes all of the buffs, there probably won't be anyone left to attack, anyway.<br><br>TM

I have just started a character like this here.  Another thing that is nice about 17 bard instead of 16 bard is this allows you to cast a level 6 bard spell with only 16 cha.

I also agree that 23 cleric is more useful than 23 bard.  I also agree to take lingering song (and I actually got extra music on mine).<br><br>How much UMD/perform did you go for?  I have planned to have 27 (+3 from cha) UMD, 27 (+3) Perform thinking thats all that is needed.
