Econo - short for economic...meaing using the least possible amounts of resources to get the desired effects. Basically using only 5 Shadowdancer levels to get Epic Dodge &amp; 11 Cleric levels to gain extended useful combat buffs (divine favor/power, battletide &amp; prayer)<br><br>This build is seriously lacking in Epic feats, however it manages to redeem itself in other ways.

With +6 items (boots/ammy/robe &amp; deflection) and enough abbility inceasing items can get AC up to 81 before that helpful lvl 30 100 perform bard skyrockets it to 88 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">       with Epic dodge as well attacks are unlikely to hit you, even without concealment, plus with the total 210% speed from Monk levels &amp; haste nothing around is likely to catch you if you decide to run...the 6th level Cleric spell heal coming in very handy!!!<br><br>Overall the 25/10/5 'Shadow Cleric' an be made into an even more formidable PvP opponent as well, just needs to get the Discipline. 15 lvls of Cleric gives more power to your Divine Favor, +2 bonus, at the cost of 20% speed &amp; 4 SR, plus with a little more Wisdom you could get up to lvl 8 spells...<br><br>As there are no additional feats lost or gained by taking 15 Cleric with 20 Monk, over 11 Cleric with 24 Monk, this build is entirely viable as either. As mentioned above you gain a little more strength in your buffs, make them a little harder to dispell &amp; gain a little duration, at very little costs, I would completely advocate the different levelling...all you need to do is replace a couple (well 4 actually) Monk levels in the Epic regions with Cleric levels...you would also lose 8 skill points...NoooOooOoo<br><br>General tactics are to buff up and run around spamming IKD! Invisibility purge is very very useful as even though you have blind fight it really makes it easier when you are fighting non-concealed enemies &amp; you yourself still have 25-50% concealment! Against higher AC enemies it's not even worth using your AB buffing spells (divine favor/power, prayer &amp; battletide) as due to only 11 Cleric lvls are fairly short lived, just sit back and fight the battle of 20s!!!<br><br>Mages are nasty...if u face a mage, ask an allied mage to Mord their shield <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">   then try to keep 'em KDed as much as possible...run and heal self as necessary. Dispells will hurt with only 11 caster levels, however buff spells are cosmetic at best, death ward helps but ineffective against implosion, freedom of movement not too much of a loss with 20 monk levels, negative energy protection big loss against Harm!<br><br>Most importantly though, this is a tried and tested PvP build which flourishes due to High AC, Epic Dodge, with self buffs to raise AB to a decent point...it may not be able to kill itself easily however there are always other targets <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By krsboss on 03/18/06 07:56</span></i></p>

I'd go Cleric 12/Monk 23, especially since you didn't pick anything at Monk25 in your write-up <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  Cleric12 adds +1 to your Divine Favor and GMW... I'd also probably change either domain to Strength in order to get more Divine Powers.<br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm

Apart from GMW not working on Monk Gloves <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">  that's fine...as I mentioned earlier don't get much from Monk 24 apart from some extra speed &amp; SR, 12/23/5 would probably be more sensible, anything over 11, less that 15 works though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>I initially started with Domain Strength, for the lower level Divine Power, however they ended up taking up the same spell slots as my extended prayer! As you can kind-of do away with Trickery (the main domain that everyone takes!) the domains are pretty tuch tangible...

War domain would give you Cat's Grace and Aura of Vitality. You can almost cap your DEX just with two spells and with the domain power you'll probably do, although for just a few rounds.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail

Yeah, I've found writing in <b>B</b>olding and a few <i>I</i>talics makes it an awful lot easier to read, plus you can generally just pick out the essentials as they should be <b>bolded</b>, however it tends to triple the time needed to post a build AND though you may assume that it may make you make sure everything is correct, mistakes can often happen (see feats taken at levels 25 &amp; 28 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> )

You claim it is playable 1-40. A bit overestimating there. It is if you like to spend the first 5 levels spamming the respawn button (6hp's/lvl and AB -1???), and the next 11 or so spending half a day at each opponenet, with a sore thumb from respawn evn then. After that your HiPS might save you, and the AC perhaps getting high enough if you get enough gold, but still you won't exactly kill off adversaries at the speed of light. Playable 17-40 is more right perhaps, or even later than that even.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Didn't anyone notice the error?  Epic Dodge requires 30 ranks in Tumble to get, so you shouldn't be able to get it until at least level 27.

I believe that Epic dodge only requires one rank in tumble, the manual is wrong.
