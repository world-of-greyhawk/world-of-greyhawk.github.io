Just a few notes.<br><br>That's an awful lot of pre-epic feats taken in epic. By my count, four epic feats are spent on pre-epics. Makes it kinda feel like the BG bonus feats are a wasted effort.  There's not a whole lot you can do.  Imp crit, and the KDs, could be dropped.  Epic Prowess also seems unnecessary (though, sure, I can see why you'd like to squeeze every drop out of AB), especially as it's one of those BG bonus feats.  I'd easily drop three BG levels for bard levels.  Bard 14 instead of EP?  Heck yeah.  Come to think of it, Bard 16 instead of IKD, or bard 19 instead of KD, or bard 26 instead of...<br><br>Were you not tempted by more bard, and less BG?  I guess you really wanted the SA, but that's an awful lot invested for 6d6.  I know a lower BG, and higher bard, build would be totally different (and probably already done), but offhand, it seems the better bet.<br><br>I shudder to imagine those fort and will saves w/out Dark Blessing.  While the end result is decent (and eminently buffable), those are shockingly bad numbers all things considered.  That said, the ease of buffing makes this pretty much a non-factor.  Just sayin'.  Wow.<br><br>HP too are shockingly awful.<br><br>Which brings me to the main point.  What can this build do that another build can't do better?  Seems like the AC potential is the best thing here, and plenty of other builds can accomplish that and more.  So... <br><br>Also, for the record, I don't think he deserves the "extremely" in capitals.  Sure, a DEX based bard isn't going to be the greatest guy out there, and may present some difficulties, but it aint that bad.  I think it's enough to say that he's a bit weak until he gets SD, which is true of plenty of SD builds.

Power Attack, Cleave, Dodge and Mobility are not even on my nice to have list. For this guy, they'd be on the "whatever" list, except they're requirements. The MUST HAVE feats are:<br><br>- Ofensively: KD and IKD (You're a Sneaker, gotta be able to generate Sneaks) Divine Might, Improved Critical (You gotta take FULL ADVANTAGE of your Divine Might Damage, which does multiply on Criticals, which is also why I chose the Rapier for the 18-20 threat range), and the AB-enhancing feats (WF, EWF, EP, Great DEXs), to make all of the above work, cuz if you can't hit them, you can't hurt them. <br><br>Defensively: 4th level Bard Spells for Improved Invisibility, Epic Dodge, Uncanny Dodge, Divine Shield, Dark Blessing, HiPS, Improved Evasion and Armor Skin to top up an already high AC.<br><br>Miscellaneous: Max UMD and Taunt (as it is both offensive and defensive, the defensive consequence of it being spell failure).<br><br>As for increasing Bard, you gotta understand the build and what it aims for before suggesting stuff like that, seriously.<br><br>This build explores some of the synergies between these 3 classes: <br><br>- Dark Blessing, Divine Might, Divine Shield + Bard's CHA Buffs.<br><br>- HiPS + BG Sneaks<br><br>- Divine Shield + Highly buffable AC and CHA + Improved Invisibility concealment bonus + Epic Dodge + HiPS + UMD Spell Mantle scrolls make him VERY HARD TO KILL, even with the sufferable HP. <br><br>Just Summarizing what each class bring into the mix:<br><br>BG: Divine Might, Divine Shield, Bull's STR, Dark Blessing, 6d6 SA damage, Fighter-type AB, 3 MUCH NEEDED Epic bonus Feats.<br><br>SD: Epic Dodge, HiPS, Improved Evasion, Uncanny Dodge, Slippery Mind.<br><br>Bard: Tumble AC (also a SD class skill), Taunt, Bard Song, Buffs, UMD.<br><br>So each class has it's usefulness, as you can see. Now that we're on the same page, onto the next step.<br><br>The only way it'd be worth it to take more Bard would be if you went past the 20 mark for Lasting Inspiration and a better song. Then you'd also HAVE TO take Curse Song.<br><br>Now let's think about it: if you drop BG a little, you lose EP at least. Drop even more and then you get BG 10 and lose another 2 epic bonus feats. Why go BG 10 when its only uses now are Dark Blessing and Bull's Strength, which you get at level 2? But now, you're spending 2 feats on a feat-starved build to get 2 levels of a class that nets you the same as the Paladin class. WHY? Drop BG altogether then. <br><br>But then if you drop BG, you have no Sneaks. Also you increase Bard, so you get Improved Invisibility much sooner, so why HiPS? If not for HiPS, why get SD AT ALL? Voila! Increasing Bard defeats the purpose of the build. So no, I wasn't AT ALL tempted to go heavier on Bard. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>For the record, you could attain "similar" results (no HiPS) with a Bard / Rogue / Paladin combo, but that means XP penalty, ALIGNMENT SHIFT and CERTAINLY 1 of 2 things, since they're mutually exclusive: you'll either lose too much pre-epic BAB or you'll have to get Epic Dodge WAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY later. Although you will get higher sneak damage and be less feat-starved, so it's not totally absurd.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;I shudder to imagine those fort and will saves w/out Dark Blessing.

Yah, I'm still not seeing a convincing argument for the BG levels.  I also don't buy the "if you're only taking two [actually four] levels, why take any?"  Why?  For Dark Blessing, Divine Might, and Divine Shield.  That's what you want from BG (and, in this case, full BAB).  Drop BG to four, put 'em all into bard.  You gain an awesome bard song, the (obvious) option of LI, and full bardic spell goodness, and, heck, we'll throw in undispellability just as a free gift..  You lose all your (unimpressive) sneak attack, some HP (heh, let's see those numbers now...), a bit of BAB, and an epic bonus feat.  Seems easily worth it in my book.<br>_________________<br>Y'all<br>re all wrong, I'm right, and there's really no arguing with that.

The initial idea was to make a BG with Bard as a supporting class. That would not be accomplished with Bard 26 / BG 4 / SD 10. And tbh that kinda defeats the purpose of having SD at all, since half of the usefulness of HiPS, which is generating Sneak Attacks is lost. Then you could go Bard 23 BG 4 Rog 13 and still get ED while having decent sneak damage, but then no HiPS. Bard in this build is used for support, and for that, 11 lvls is more than enough. <br><br>With JumJones' suggestion, I'd gain 1 AB, 1 AC in the bard song and 1 Bard spell level at the expense of 1 Epic Bonus Feat and 1d6 Sneak Attack. An about even trade IMO. Spell durations kinda suck, but that's just something you have to live with. The only thing I see can be done without defeating the initial idea is taking 2 points out of DEX to get 4 CON and increase HP at the expense of 2 AB and AC. However, having 15 CHA as you posted kinda makes it not worth it taking DM and DS for only +8 CAPPED CHA bonuses to AC and damage, which also defeats half of the purpose of BG. <br><br>I am not saying that your alternatives aren't viable or even an improvement, but they go against the whole reason I even created this build. What really sucks is that BG is so worthless that only 4 lvls of it give you pretty much everything you need. Also, the 2 feats it needs as requirements heavily restrict the combo possibilities. I swear that I would rather take 4 paladin and shift alignments thrice than have to take PA and Cleave on a build that has absolutely no use for them for only 4 BG levels. Anyway, thanks for the inputs <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>P.S.: Grim, I will have to disagree with you. A change from Bard 11 / BG 19 / SD 10 to Bard 26 / BG 4 / SD 10 is hardly a tweak, it's more like a "do a different build" type of advice. Still valid, just not a tweak <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> .<br><br>Take it EZ!
