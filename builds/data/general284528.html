Thanks. My math was off a bit and your initial stats are better. Also, I somehow had the idea that I would have to max out set and disable traps in order to handle epic traps. <br><br>Usually I for rangers I go with hand-axes but I think I haven't used KD and IKD enough in my builds. Would it be better with those to use a dual-wield weapon? It is a lot of feats to be able to do that and rangers don't have lots of feats. Also, is cleave useful at higher levels? I usually play stealth types and it is quite useful for getting through battles quickly. But this build will have a lot more hit points than I usually have and it may not be necessary. <br><br>(As you pointed out Rangers should be flexible with armor and weapons. Sometimes dual wielding in hide and sometimes with shield and chain.) <br><br>Also, you are right about skill mastery. I used it with a Rogue/SD before but one should set up traps before battles not during battles. <br><br>Ranger 25/rogue 10/HS 5 looks pretty good. Could hand out a good amount of damage especially to favored enemies, fairly stealthy, has few weaknesses and can set up a nice battle plan with traps, ranged weapons, umd, and a companion. <br><br>Again thanks for your help. And thanks to CD. It should be apparent to anyone that his posts have much to do with thinking of how to develop this character.<br>_________________<br>Entropy is a joule thief

I will still have to fiddle with the numbers. As such I won't be able to set or disarm epic traps such as epic fire or electrical traps which have a set DC of 65. Skill mastery actually might be useful because a spectacular failure with an epic trap would tend to ruin anyone's day.<br>_________________<br>Entropy is a joule thief

I think I will need epic skill focus. I played with the character developing module and even with skill focus in both set and disable, both cats grace spells cast and one with the land, which has a +4 to set traps, I only got up to skills of 60 for setting. That still gives me 5 more points.<br><br>Your analysis of strategy is correct. Furthermore, if the battle will be tough you need two trap areas. One for retreating to and one to do damage. This is not always possible but it is nice if it can be done. <br><br>Too bad the build cannot handle creating traps. But a build can't do everything.

No I don't plan to use the traps in combat. I have before with shadow dancer levels. You are right. Skill mastery is not needed for this build.<br><br>HS. I just like the idea of it. It also works quite nicely with a str based ranger. But as you point out, I will be missing out on creating traps. More rogue levels would be be handy for that. I also like the idea of getting two epic feats for two non-epic feats. Rangers don't have a lot of feats so I have to be careful here.<br><br>And if I need skill focus and ESF in both set and disable traps I won't have an excess of feats.<br>_________________<br>Come on, you sons of b*tches!

Thanks again for your clarification. This would probably be more useful than skill focus. I have a weak spot for dual-wield weapons but I don't think I can afford the skills for that in this build. <br><br>I still have the problem of not being able to craft traps. I could add two to intelligence later and then start throwing points into craft trap. But my basic stats are already spread quite wide. I wouldn't really then be a str based or a dex based ranger but an int based ranger which is not the most effective build. Or I could drop the HS idea and add more rogue levels.<br>_________________<br>Entropy is a joule thief

If you are making a trapper, dump some points into craft trap.  You can carry the components (low weight) and craft the desired trap in the field.

And you can have these bags the quick access bar. I have different bags for different traps on the shift layer. (And no I am usually not so tidy.)<br><br><br>The other problem is skill points. There is just no way I could afford to put levels into craft traps. It looks like I will have to start with Int of 16 or give up the HS concept. If I want Hide, MS, Disc, UMD, Tumble, Search and Listen all at their highest levels I would have to have to. I suppose I could go with INT of 14 and only max out UMD, Tumble, Set and Disable Traps. Hide, MS, Search and Listen could be helped out by spells and/or magic items.<br>_________________<br>Entropy is a joule thief
