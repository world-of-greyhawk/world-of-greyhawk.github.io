Race: Human.<br>Definitely a Rogue: Quick, stealthy and highly skilled with great reflexes. Can use any gadget (UMD).<br>Has a background as a Navy officer(Commander). So some Fighter is in order as well.<br>He's not a holy warrior, so no divine classes. <br>He has a lot of support from his secret service. I guess HS is the closest we get here.<br>His choice of weapons (fists, gun, gadgets) is based on the setting - 20th century, earth.<br>In a FR setting he would use anything small and easy to hide under his coat (daggers, a miniature x-bow, darts).<br>He's a charmer, highly charismatic with style, class and finesse. So he's high on the diplomatic skills and has a positive charisma modifier.<br>He has high dexterity, constitution, intelligence and charisma. His wisdom is questionable, but his will is strong (save boosting feat). Strenght is average.<br><br>His alignment.... He saves the world and punishes the bad guys. He is truly faithful to the queen's secret service. But he doesn't go by the book and trusts his own intuition. He's good to, but never faithful to his women. In my opinion he's more good than neutral, and more chaotic than lawful.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...
