I found myself torn between Dev Crit and not, and decided on both styles, see the link at the foot to its brother. <br><br>As a meleer it is quite formidable, but will come up against the usual issues against mages with Mord's and No-Save spells.

Hm, well enough. It's quite powerful. Off course only a buffing melee'r, but even the long-lasting buffs sis enough to keep it battle-ready at all times. Decent saves too. Might be worth it to pursue Cleric 25 perhaps.<br><br>I don't really like Dev crit although I understand it's power. So I like this better.<br><br>Good build from you....Samphus. And it will be a strong build in any setting too.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

Thanks Grim... not a huge fan of Dev Crit myself, but when I was working on this, I saw the potential it could have without sacrificing too much from the build, hence the two options.<br><br>One thing I should point out, and I only realised it after posting was that to get the flurry to work, it would have to  use a kama and not scimitar.<br><br>So potentially you have another feat free pre-epic.. your choice however.
