This is another build I came up with while I was on holidays, but I only finished playing it through 10 minutes ago, so that's why it took so long.<br><br>Basically, I wanted an archer-type character that could still dish out healthy amouns of damage. This is what I ended up with.<br><br><br><b>Sniper Draconis</b><br><br>Race – Elf<br><br>Alignment – Chaotic Good (Neutral would be better)<br><br>Playable from 1 - 40 <br><br>PvP/PvM – Both, but considerably better in PvP<br><br>Stats: Starting (Ending) <br>STR 16 (30)<br>DEX 17 (26)<br>CON 8 (10)<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14 (16)<br>CHA 12 (14)<br><br>HP (Maxed) - 312 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  <br><br>Naked AC - 32 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>AB – <b>49</b> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">  <br><br><i>Leveling guide</i> <br>01: Bard 1 Point-Blank Shot<br>02: Bard 2 <br>03: Bard 3 Rapid Shot<br>04: Bard 4 STR +1<br>05: Bard 5 <br>06: RDD 1 Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>07: RDD 2 <br>08: RDD 3 STR +1<br>09: RDD 4 Power Attack<br>10: AA 1 <br>11: AA 2 <br>12: AA 3 STR +1 Improved Critical: Longbow<br>13: AA 4 <br>14: AA 5 <br>15: AA 6 Cleave<br>16: AA 7 STR +1<br>17: AA 8 <br>18: AA 9 Great Cleave<br>19: AA 10<br>20: RDD 5 STR +1<br>21: RDD 6 Overwhelming Critical: Longbow<br>22: RDD 7 <br>23: RDD 8 <br>24: RDD 9 STR +1, Devastating Critical: Longbow<br>25: RDD 10 <br>26: AA 11 <br>27: AA 12 Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>28: AA 13 DEX +1<br>29: AA 14 Great Dexterity I<br>30: AA 15 Epic Prowess<br>31: AA 16 <br>32: AA 17 DEX +1<br>33: AA 18 Great Dexterity II, Great Dexterity III<br>34: AA 19 <br>35: AA 20 <br>36: AA 21 DEX +1, Great Dexterity IV<br>37: AA 22 Great Dexterity V<br>38: AA 23 <br>39: AA 24 Armor Skin<br>40: Bard 6 DEX +1<br><br>Skills (Total – 254) <br>Discipline 40 (50)<br>Hide 37 (45)<br>Listen 22 (21)<br>Lore 8 (11/17)<br>Move Silently 37 (45)<br>Spellcraft 37 (40)<br>Tumble 40<br>UMD 33 (35)<br><br>Saves<br>Fort - 22<br>Reflex - 31<br>Will - 20<br><br>Spells:<br>Level 1<br>•	Amplify<br>•	Identify<br>•	Lesser Dispel<br>•	Summon Creature I<br><br>Level 2<br>•	Darkness<br>•	Invisibility<br>•	Ultravision<br><br>Suggested Equipment<br>I strongly suggest that you go to extreme lengths to somehow get a longbow with Mighty +4 or higher (preferably +10).

This would be done at the cost of -1 enchant arrow, and 4 HP, but you would get +2 to lore <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  .<br><br>Also, you could always change this build around to include perform, seeing as of now you sing a little bit better then a dying alley cat.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Big Meph on 07/20/06 05:09</span></i></p>

A bit better than an alley cat, huh? That's Funny! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    Just on a quick overview (as it's gettin' late in my part of the world <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    must say, I likes it: really neat build, Meph. Another drake . . . yeppers, we knows that I likes them ... and with an arcane focus/that arrow of death thing goin' down. COOL <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   <br><br>You get Bard (2) buff/spells - why don't you recommend cat's and bull's - that would give you more AC, AB and damage. Not that you need more AB - 49 for an archer, that's pretty darn good alright. But these bard buffs would boost yer damage and all even more, yes? and then there's the Dex/AC etc. factor. I like that you need only boost dex for AC etc. and need not rely on equipment. Plus, as an archer, yer of course shootin' at a distance, can enchant yer own arrows, and that's all good stuff.<br><br>I'd be inclined though to take some perform skills on him. At level 6 bard, you don't need a ton of them to max out or anything; this too would give you an AB and damage boost, plus some saves etc. OK, not a huge amount but still, as compared to, say, more lore than what's necessary to qualify for RDD or something, the perform skill would seem to serve you well. Promise to take a closer look tomorrow but, in the meantime, really nice, Meph! Very nice combo and looks good! - oh, a drake archer: how so cool is that?! Might say, enchangingly so! Drake on (nice, Meph <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    ~ Tyr<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/20/06 05:50</span></i></p>

I've seen this build on my server and it seems effective. Personally I'm not sure it outperforms the the Fighter and EWS versions, but it sure does have a nice AC boost.<br><br>Your AB is 49 which in itself is very good, but not for an AA. Your other qualities compensate off-course, but trade-off is the AC. You can go with more DEX and less STR, since you won't find many environments with +10 mighty. And as for soooo many AA's, there's always the problem with not having uncanny dodge.<br><br>But it's a very good and playable build for sure, just thought I'd give a few suggestions/pointers.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

Well thanks for the kind words Tyr and Grim.<br><br>To Tyr:<br>I actually kind of forgot about Cat's grace. Seeing as my character already had the +12 to dex (from items), it didn't really occur to me that I'd need the spell. <br><br>As for Bull's strength however, it isn't really as necessary seeing as it already has enough STR to make the maximum "mighty" requirements (well it's not really the maximum, but seeing as I don't play online at all, I've never seen a bow higher then Mighty +10). Bull's Strength would only really be necessary if I needed to fight in hand to hand combat<br><br>To Grim:<br>I really have nothing to say to you that you didn't already cover yourself, except that I went to STR 30 mainly because I already needed one of 25 for DC: Longbow, and I thought I may as well get the full bonus. Thanks for the recognition though.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Big Meph on 07/20/06 09:03</span></i></p>

I'd definitely go with STR 26/DEX 30.<br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a>

Hey, this looks really familiar...<br><br>In addition to the above suggestions (which also sound familiar) I'd change AA 24 to Bard 7, since AA 24 gets you absolutely nothing, and Bard 7 would at least get you another skill dump in epic as well as a couple level 3 spells you can't cast without 16 Cha.
