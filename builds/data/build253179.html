Kill things with spear.  <br><br>In the initial incarnation of this build, 34 Strength was taken, but doing so meant losing 1 point in Dex, Int and Chr, a loss of 43 skill points, and the loss of ESF: Taunt.  While a 47AB looked really cool on a 3 APR build, I didn't find it as effective or as nasty as the 46AB version.  And while 3 attacks per round doesn't look like much, he does tremendous damage on each hit, and can crank out more attacks when he flicks the spear into Whirlwind Mode--very useful against the mobs.  Basically, it's a smooth blend of both offense and defense.<br><br>Only a few other builds like this exist, and they go for PM16 for the +4AC and the girly-man Epic Warding spell.  This cat, I thought, could hold his own in combat without Epic Warding, and it doesn't protect one against spells anyway, so I choose Offense over defense and went for the highest amount of WM possible and still get PM10.<br><br><br><i>Fixed crit range - Kail Pendragon</i><br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/14/07 13:32</span></i></p>

Well done Dwarflord. It's indeed PM season lately, I feel inspired by the class too and Hallowen ain't yet close <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   And it's not just PM season, there's a fair amount of Something 25-26 lvls/Bard 4-5/PM 10 builds running free.<br><br>I wouldn't worry about the 3 apr, with UMD you just need Divine Power scrolls (either in a scroll rich environment or get yourself a scribing cleric pal) and you're set. Spear's a good weapon and PM covers the AC loss among the rest. The only pity is you're missing KD.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 03/27/09 13:23</span></i></p>

Nice build I think, You have the most important combat feat (BF), and good AB.<br>But your basic damage bonus is not +16.<br><br>You have 1d8+11 (17-20x4)
