Hey everyone,<br><br>I've been looking over the boards for a few days and I'm looking for something that uses the PM to get the super-high AC.  If you read my last post on here, yes, it's for the FF1 server.<br><br>I like the Pale Drake build so far because with some slight modifications I end up with an AC in the 90s, a STR of 40 (naturally), Darkvision, immune to crits, etc.  That build was made a long time ago, however, and I was wondering if anyone knew of someone who'd made a better one since then.  It doesn't have to be PM/RDD so to speak, just as long as it's a juggernaut in combat.<br><br>King Harbromm

You might consider a FTR/WIZ/PM. Take all your PM levels in epic to reserve your BAB. Go with STR and don't even thnk about casting any type of offensive spells. Maybe something on the order of FTR 21/WIZ 3/PM 16. POssibly FTR 18/WIZ 2 pre-epic (you lose only 1 BAB) or FTR 20 pre-epic for the full BAB.<br><br>I don't know if this would be all that powerful or not, but you'd get a +10 boost to your AC, immunity to crits, decent STR (could probably end up with 30 STR and +44 unbuffed AB), and an epic spell. You would basically have no spellcasting, though.<br><br>Bruce Lee just posted a Bard 6/RDD 10/PM 24 build on the epic builds page. You may want to take a peek at that as well.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

cin, it's probably better to use bard for a build like that, rather than wizard. <br><br>if you take 20 levels in a fighter class, like ranger, fighter, barbarian etc, you can then take three bard levels in epic, sixteen PM levels, and a final bard level to max out tumble and spellcraft.<br><br>you don't get the spells that the wizard version may enjoy, but you do get tumble as a class skill.

If you took barbarian instead of fighter, you'd have the damage reduction.  You could also have a high terrifying rage aura &amp; dev crit.<br><br>barb/bard/pm  <br>24/3/13<br><br>@ lvl 40:<br><br>dev crit base DC 39<br>Terrifying rage about DC 52<br>5/- damage reduction<br>crit/sneak immunity<br>stun/hold/paralize imunity<br><br>Granted that only 13 levels of PM would not give you epic spells.<br><br><br>you'd even have room for 2 Epic Fire Resistances if you wanted.<br><br>maybe swap a late PM level for bard to bump up your tumble more.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 10/07/05 19:32</span></i></p>
