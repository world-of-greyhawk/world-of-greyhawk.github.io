First time posting; please bear with me if I violate a protocol.<br><br>For RP reasons, I was looking into a rapier and kukri dual wielding human with improved crit on both, maybe even overwhelming crit.  I've seen nothing like that here, from which I conclude that it is a terribly impractical build, giving up too much to be worth doing.  Is that correct?

I didn't have any in mind, particularly--just whatever would work.  I imagine some combination of fighter, rogue, monk, ranger; maybe even paladin.<br><br>Thanks for taking the trouble to reply.

Here's a couple I worked up that dual-wield and have focus in two different weapons. You'd have to adapt them to your needs, but they could serve as a template for something you may want to play.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "212559", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Guardsman</a>. In this build, you could easily replace some feats to fit in Exotic and Improved Crit for both weapons, as well as PA, Cleave, and Great Cleave. I'd drop Blooded, Skill Focus, Disarm, Improved Disarm, and Alertness. Replace HS levels with Rogue.<br><br>In epic levels, without HS, you lose Epic Will and ESF:Discipline. Drop ESF:Spot and replace it with Over Crit for one of your weapons and there's an error in the build where Armor Skin is taken twice. Take OVer crit in your other weapon with one of those feat choices.<br><br>There's also <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "214152", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Dualist</a>. You need to again drop some feats. Drop Expertise and move Blind Fight into its place. Take Exotic Weapons at level one instead of Blind Fight. In epic levels, drop the DR feats and take Over Crit for both weapons. This will leave you with an open feat for whatever you like. You could also switch the build to Human, starting with 16 CON instead of 18. This gives you an extra feat, whicih could be used for Exotic Weapons.<br><br>Anyway, hope that serves to give you some ideas. If you want further info or help putting a build together, just post with some criteria of what you'd like and I'll see what I can do.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Yeah, Pale Masters used to be immune to critical hits, but could still be sneak attacked. I don't recall which patch fixed it, but it was either 1.66 or 1.67.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
