I've checked, and there's only 1 DwD, Monk, Pally combo: the Holy Walking Wall by Ithacan.<br><br>Right now I'm working on a 16 Pally, 22 DwD, 2 Monk. I want to have the Holy Avenger Spell, huge HP and decent saves, along with good AC.<br><br>The Pally and DwD will be taken to lvl 20, to max BAB, with monk lvls at 21 and 40 to serve as skill dumps and to pick up feats. Unfortunately this means that you don't get Deflect Arrows until lvl 40, but it is necessary both to max out Tumble (and isn't bad for me, because my PW has a negligible archer population).<br><br>There is some flex in the build, you could build it dex, kamas, and Wisdom, or a traditional heavy-armored dwarf with axe and all. Either way: Strong against mages, because it will have high Fort saves and HP, strong against fighters (High Dwarven Wall, with good AC), strong against sneakers (DwD defensive awareness, unable to be flanked, and high HP).<br><br>Still working out the intricacies of the build, but it looks good. The only Con so far is that it isn't focused in 1 skill, you can really use any of them. My tentative build (fullplate version) has 14 Wis, high Con, enough Dex not to get pentalties, and focuses on Str.<br><br><br><br><br>Comments on the concept?<br><br>-EDIT-<br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">   Oops, thought I was in General Discussion. Could a mod please move this?

Well, you'll find out that weirdly, Dwarven Defender combinations are not very commonly found...<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;There is some flex in the build, you could build it dex, kamas, and Wisdom, or a traditional heavy-armored dwarf with axe and all.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I would not go Dex and Wis on such a build, you'd deal no damage at all. Taking kamas could be a problem if you're taking monk until epics, and it's preferable to go dual-wield on it... it should be a lot easier to take armor and another weapon.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;My tentative build (fullplate version) has 14 Wis, high Con, enough Dex not to get pentalties, and focuses on Str.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Sounds very good, but anyway you need 13 Dex to be a Dwarven Defender, with a Heavy Armor you really can't get your Dex AC into penalties ground.<br>What about the weapon? I think you should go with a strong weapon, two handed or two weapons, a Dwarven Defenders with high DR hardly need a shield.<br><br>How much STR do you get? Are you taking Divine Might/Shield? Paladins buff CHA excellent, so it's not completely unviable.
