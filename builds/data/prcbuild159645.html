Nice. I played something similar with 2.1, but the race was human. Aren't mystic theurge bonus feats at 15, 21 and 27?<br><br>I did a 6wiz/4cleric/10MT split pre-epic. That gives you 3 attacks per round, and 4 with divine power. Makes for quite a nice tank, equipped in full plate mail and a tower shield. AC is insane on this build.<br><br>My domain preferences included plant, to get creeping doom, and magic, for call lightning.
