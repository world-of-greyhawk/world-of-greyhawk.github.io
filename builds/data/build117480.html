The Saga of Dragon Builds continues...<br><br>Are you one of those who shout around the forums, asking WHY oh WHY your dragon shape has no aura of fear? Ask no longer... Introducing the Ztubi'Dnaem the Terrifying, dragon which makes even the hardiest warrior *** their pants (not Paladin's thought. They seem to lack in brains to fear lizard with 3 times their size, strenght and stamina...)<br><br>The Build, AKA Dragon Fear<br><br>Human - Chaotic Neutral (Alignment of the madmen. Take the "psychotic" voice set for added effect.)<br><br>Barbarian 25/Druid 15<br>Stats:<br>STR: 8<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 10<br>INT: 14<br>WIS: 18 (+9 +3)<br>CHA: 14<br><br>Last point goes to either CHA or WIS.<br><br>Level Progression: 20 Barbarian, 14 Druid, 4 Barbarian, 1 Druid, 1 Barbarian (You MAY want to replace this level with Bard, to get +4 AC from tumble, and maxing some useful skills. OR if U want to abuse the bug and get both massive boost to AC AND number of attacks, shift alignment to Lawful Neutral and take 1 Monk level. This way you can still max the most useful skills)<br><br>Pre-Epic Feats:<br>- Skill Focus: Intimidate (higher DC for TR)<br>- Zen Archery (if you build this build in PW, this is a must for surviving. Bows are your most accurate source of damage.)<br>- Toughness (together with barbarian hit dice this keeps you alive, hopefully)<br>- (Improved) Knockdown (Do I need to say why?)<br><br>Rest are for you to consider. I took Skill Focus: Taunt (for taunting those fleeting losers) and Called Shot (dunno why...)<br><br>Epic Feats:<br>- 3x Great Wisdom (first 3 feats, propably)<br>- Epic Skill Focus: Intimidate (for maximizing your "Dragon Fear aura")<br>- Armor Skin (Two words: Dragon. Scale.)<br>- Extend Spell (can't take pre-epic without hurting AB)<br>- Terrifying Rage (Dragon Fear aura)<br>- Dragon Shape (well, this IS a Dragon build )<br><br>Little about the stats:<br><br>HP: - (unrolled, Blue Dragon Shape) 908 (808 +100 Dragon Shape bonus HP)<br>- +40 Blood Frenzy (extended: 30 rounds)<br>- +40 Greater Rage<br>- +80 Aura of Vitality (extended: 30 rounds)<br>- Little bug I found: When U have very little HP left (after Harm, for example), U can Export your character. This makes U reshape, and gain all HP bonuses again... Strange.<br><br>AB: BAB 30 + 25 STR bonus (+6 Greater Rage +2 Blood Frenzy +4 Aura of Vitality, and after some fade, +2-5 from Bull Strenght which outlasts all of the rest.) +2 while in wilderness area.<br>AC: 49 (after all buffs and minuses from raging and Blood Frenzy, 54)<br>Terrifying Rage DC: 43 Skill Points + 3 SkF: Intimidate + 10 ESkF: Intimidate +2 CHA bonus = DC SHOULD be 58, but, for some reason, varies between 57 and 66 (it LITERALLY varies: tested in my Hack &amp; Slash module [spawns Goblin Elite infinitely], and DC changed for every opponent...)<br><br>Oh, and a bit of warning: This build can eat your machine, if you play a module with masses of small monsters in one place.<br><br>This build made my NWN crash for the THIRD time during my long playing time, due to spawning of 24 Goblins right next to me (crashed while trying to show the 24 goblins AND calculate DC and saving throws for each of them...)<br><br>And then some interesting points:<br><br>1. Terrifying Rage either Fears the enemy, OR paralyses it WITH FEAR. Thus, you may get message: Immune to Paralysis when U rage near Paralysis immune creatures...<br><br>2. When your opponents are paralysed (I think), you sometimes get Coup De Grace! (of the 20 test subjects I killed before NWN chashed, 3 we're CDG:d.)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/26/08 08:00</span></i></p>
