This is an old build of mine that I had a second look at recently and decided I wanted to share. What I had in mind with this build was to reach AC 100+. <br>The build is geared towards that goal in every way, sacrificing AB and HPs, making it quite hard to play normally. <br>The build has an AC of 101 self buffed in mundane equipment,(counting in the effect of curse song on the opponents). <br><br><b>The Boneguard</b> <br><br>Bard 11/ PM 28/ Cleric 1<br>Theme build, AC – low playability<br>Elf, non good, non lawful<br><br><b>Attributes </b><br>Str 13<br>Dex 18 (31)<br>Con 6<br>Int 13<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 16 (19)<br><br><b>Level Guide </b><br>1 Bard 1 Curse song<br>2 Bard 2<br>3 Bard 3 Dodge<br>4 Bard 4 Dex 19<br>5 Bard 5<br>6 Bard 6 Expertise<br>7 Bard 7<br>8 PM 1 Dex 20<br>9 PM 2 Improved Expertise<br>10 PM 3<br>11 PM 4<br>12 Bard 8 Empower spell, Cha 17<br>13 PM 5<br>14 PM 6<br>15 PM 7 Power attack<br>16 PM 8 Cha 18<br>17 PM 9<br>18 Cleric 1 Divine shield<br>19 PM 10<br>20 Bard 9 Cha 19<br>21 PM 11 Armor skin<br>22 PM 12<br>23 PM 13 Energy resistance Acid<br>24 PM 14 Great dex I, Dex 22<br>25 PM 15<br>26 PM 16 Epic mage armor<br>27 Bard 10 Great dex II<br>28 PM 17 Dex 24<br>29 PM 18<br>30 PM 19 Great dex III, Hellball<br>31 PM 20<br>32 PM 21 Dex 26<br>33 PM 22 Great dex IV, Epic warding<br>34 PM 23<br>35 PM 24<br>36 PM 25 Great dex V, Greater ruin, Dex 29<br>37 PM 26<br>38 PM 27<br>39 PM 28 Great dex VI, Mummy dust<br>40 Bard 11 Dex 31<br><br><b>Skills </b><br>Total skillpoints 157<br>Perform 14 (18)<br>Tumble 40<br>Spellcraft 42 (43) [45]<br>Taunt 43 (47-53)<br>Leftover 18<br><br><b>Saves </b> <br>Fort: 20 <br>Refl: 29 <br>Will: 24 <br><br><b>Attack</b><br>AB: 22/17/12 (33/28/23) (Empowered Bull’s, GMW, War Cry, Bard song) [41/36/31] [Curse song, Taunt]<br>Damage: Rapier 1d6 +1(18-20/x2), Buffs +11<br>(If you take W. finesse instead of  Dodge, you get AB 31 (42) [50], making the character a bit easier to play normally).<br><br><b>AC</b><br>AC in Robes and Towershield, unbuffed: 50 (Base 10, Armor skin 2, Bone skin 16, Tumble 8.

the highest possible AC obtainable from a build is from a Bard (sorc) 3-5 / Monk 6-9 / Pale Master 28, halfling, starting stats 20 dex, wis 16 with all attributes going to wisdom &amp; 6 great wis<br><br>without any items at all you get:<br><br>10 base + 1 halfling +16 pm +5 dexterity +11 wisdom +8 tumble +1 monk +20 epic mage armor +10 improved expertise +1 mage armor +2 armor skin = <b>85</b><br><br>not anything special, but that is completely naked!<br><br>...now if you throw in some Haste, items to give +12 to dex &amp; wis, you get <b>101</b> and this is on your Character sheet, WITHOUT curse song <i>effectively</i> increase AC. Also you still have 10 AC left in the dodge cap to push this up to <b>111</b>...<br><br>furthermore as most of your AC is hard-coded and from Wisdom you only lose 11-21 (depending on dex buff &amp; having haste!) when caught flat-footed.<br><br>However this is even more of an AB gimp...you would have to use Zen Archery to even make an attack (29 AB ftw) and you may as well take <i>Dirty Fighting</i> to Maximize the damage you'd deal!

I accept that it may be unreasonable to assume that you will be able to get items to boost Dex &amp; Wis by +12, however as a level 40 epic character it would not be unreasonable to assume that you would gain access to at least Haste scrolls, potions of Owl's Wisdom &amp; Cat's Grace, this could give a +8 to AC (from the 85), <br><br>furthermore it would not be unreasonable to assume that such an epic character <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">  would have access to some kind of magical boots that would give a dodge bonus stackable with that of Epic Mage Armor, even if it is too unreasonable to assume you will get an item of greater than +5 to beat 3 other EMA armor types!!!

krsboss, I don't disageree with you. Magical items are available in most gaming environments. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I have made a build that can reach AC 100+ on it's own. <br><br>Making a build that has the highest possible AC <i>with</i> items is a very different task. The build will look very different because you don't have to focus that much on how to get the most out of your buffs. The build you mention is in line with that. As I said, I find your post both informative and interesting.<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan
