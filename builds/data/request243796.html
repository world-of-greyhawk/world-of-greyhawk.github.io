Level 30 - Human<br><br>-Must contain the mentioned Classes with at least 3 levels of Monk, not spread out. At least 4 levels of CoT for Wisdom, and the remainder in Druid. This does not limit the build to only 3 monk or only 4 CoT though. Those are just the minimums.<br><br>-Count on Nothing more than +3 items, with no Perma-Haste or immunities.<br><br>--------------------------<br><br>So does anyone happen to have a build for this? I have quite a few, most of them seem pretty good but I dont know the competition... I dont know if there is something better. I guess I would like it to focus on AB and AC more so than anything else (i.e. Spell Power)<br><br>So far, I have gotten 75 AC with 48 AB with around 5 attacks, maybe 6... I forget. Is this the best, or can it be better?<br><br>I dont know these things, so if anyone has a better build, please post.. thanks.

Here's one way to get there. Monk 6 for AC, KD/IKD and speed, CoT 10 for extra feats, saves boni and BAB 16 at 20th lvl (4 apr armed, 6 unarmed). Extra Stunning Fists since there are only 6 monk lvls and since the WIS is high enough to make it worthwhile. Archery feats help unshifted, drop them if you don't need them (Exp/IE might be a good choice).

This build seems pretty solid so far as I can tell, I like most of the stats and all that, AB and AC when shifted are quite good if I am not mistaken.<br><br>I was kind of curious about something though. Are the Archery feats really worth it when you have Animal Shapes? Wouldnt they better suit for playability rather than a bow? Plus, if you drop the bow feats you can take KD and IKD without 6 monk, leave it at 3 or 4 and save a few levels that could be put into Druid for Elemental Shape which would help for playability probably. I dont think that would take away from anything in Dragon Shape aside from Speed and 2 Stunning fists, which can be made up for with simple IKD in most cases; and when that doesn't work there are still at least 3 stunning fists.<br><br>I think the 10 CoT would be worth while, I have never seen a CoT heavy build for DS, but it does help BAB and amount of feats so that could be benificial for things like Armour Skin and Epic Prowess?<br><br>I will look into this build, make a few changes (I think) and post it back here when I am done for, hopefully, some critiquing.<br><br>Thanks Kail.

Why not try this: Druid to 12, focus on a melee weapon to qualify. Ability scores focused on Wisdom, Charisma and Intelligence in that order. Take 8 COT, picking up combat feat goodies and the heavy armor proficency, while stacking up your ab and saving throws. Once epic, use the bonus CoT feats for great wisdom until you hit 30, placing the rest into Great charisma to take advantage of the cha-based duration of the CoT divine wrath feature. Take 2 more druid levels to qualify for dragon shape and finally a monk level at 40 to max out tumble hide, move silently and discipline. Out the gate as a dragon your ab, ac and saves will be very nice, with a respectable and nearly unsoakable damage output. With divine wrath your 25 levels of CoT will be like hitting the turbo, knocking your ab into the 70's for about one minute; long enough to maul hipsters, acid sheath mages, and take the weapons right to your inventory of any armed foe. The claw size category is an advantage when calculating an unarmed disarm attempt. Long range nukers and arcane archers will be your only realy problems, as your speed will be reduced in dragonshape.

Actually the Archery feats are in for playability, you'll not be shifted all the time and Zen Archery gives you a respectable AB boost, given your WIS and Monk's speed will help you stay away from reach. If you don't plan to use a bow then I'd suggest to get expertise/IE instead, extra AC is always handy.<br><br>Monk 6 also gives you +1 AC  and skill dumps besides KD/IKD, +10% speed and more SF per day as you say. If dropping Monk lvls you'll have to go Druid 16/Monk 4/CoT 10 taking the 4th Monk lvl at 29th lvl not to lose AB and the final skill dump. <br><br>It's ultimately your choice if you prefer getting Elemental Shape (Huge) 1x day and 8th lvl spell slots, (handy to extend AoV) <i>at the cost</i> of 2 feats, 2 SF x day (and that's a loss when you have so few uses) and mid career skill dumps. <i>The choice is between two different styles of playability, if you know what I mean</i>. Built to taste.<br><br>Regarding AB/AC: with a lvl 30 cap and your server's rules I believe the stats I gave you are the best you can get for a Druid/Monk/CoT dragon. BTW, don't trust the character sheet to know your AB and AC, it lies.<br><br><b>AB: 45</b><br><b>AB <i>(AoV, BS, BF, Divine Wrath)</i>: 53-56</b><br><br><b>AC: 58</b><br><b>AC <i>(Barkskin, +3 armor, AoV, Cat's Grace potion, Owl's Insight, Owl's Wisdom potion)</i>: 76-79 (+5/10 exp/IE)</b><br><br>AB gets a further +2 in wilderness areas (not counting towards the cap).<br><br>The problem with AB is that you don't have many ways to rise it (and DS merges Armor only, ie armor, shield and helmet).

MAX AB is 71 (73 in wilderness areas) and you won't get past that because of the cap. You'll need potions and/or external buffing to do it though. Also, I don't think you'll make it past 20 with CHA and so the DW duration will be something like 30 seconds (5 rounds).<br><br>Also, unarmed disarm won't help your AB, since unarmed disarm does not benefit from any boni/mali to AB due to weapon size difference, be it a halfling monk disarming a great sword wielder or a dragon disarming a dagger wielding fool. That is, you'll always hit at -4 AB (-6 with Disarm only) for attempting the maneuver.

*sighs* Another question... sort of.<br><br>I just realized that the more Druid levels you have, the more your AC will be. With Owls Insight you will get +1 AC for every additional 2 levels, so wouldn't it be best for more Druid levels. This means more AC, more Spells and Higher DC's, Elemental Shape for Playability, and maybe something I'm forgetting...<br><br>But then again, I suppose that anything that can actually hit above 60-80 AC with 30 levels, will likely not be able to do more than 40 damage anyways, and there is no way on my server to pass DR/+6 unless you beat the DR with brute force. So I suppose that extra AC is less valuable than AB.<br><br>So what is the best way to pump up AB? More CoT Pre-Epic, Monk levels for more Attacks, what else? Taking enough CoT Epic for Epic Prowess... and thats it right?

Hmm. So the only way to make it higher, is Epic Prowess and more Pre-Epic CoT, right? And the conflict here is that you dont want to drop drop Monk levels because you want the bonus feat IKD, and more stunning attacks. For some reason though, stunning attacks dont seem to matter to me (I think because IKD fits more... my preference). But if you got rid of those 2 unnecisary Pre-Epic Monk levels, that could become an extra 2 CoT levels for +2 AB, right? Plus, the extra feat from that could get Knockdown, and if I remove Extra Stunning Fists that would get my IKD instead. Plus, I dont much care for Called Shot, so that could free up another feat for pretty much anything (Maybe Empower Spell.) That would give me Emp Bullstrength for a slightly higher AB, in addition to the extra Pre-Epic CoT's AB.<br><br>Would that be as high as I could get it? If I moved too much CoT pre-epic then I cant get Epic Prowess in addition to the GW feats.<br><br>Any tips?

It has nothing to do with my attachment for IKD or more monk lvls. What I said is that there's no way to improve AB unless you drop all monk lvls, which I do not advocate. Actually I was mistaken, cause there's no way at all to improve your AB beyond the one the build I gave you gets (you can get the same or less with other builds).<br><br>Empower spell is already there (besides if you look at it max buffed AB is calculated with STR capped at 60 and  you can do that only with a lucky empowered BS roll plus BF and AoV), Called Shot is much more valuable than what you seem to think (called shot leg effectively increases you AB, called shot arm your AC) and 2 more CoT preepic would lose you Epic Prowess without getting you any increase in BAB at all (therefore you'd get -1 AB).<br><br>At most you can go Druid 12/Monk 3/CoT 5 preepic then finish Druid 16/Monk 4/CoT 10 for the elemental shapes to keep the same AB as now, at the cost of 1 AC, 10% speed and 2 feats. Other solutions will cost you also AB.<br><br>I hope this makes it clear.<br><br>PS: re-reading your post it looks like you seem to forget that past 10th lvl CoT gets bonus feats every 4 lvls not every 2.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Wait for me Dragon, we'll meet in the sky<br>By fire and magic, I'm sworn<br>Hell is calling, we cannot be denied<br>Fly to the blackness of the Storm<br><br>We must die to be reborn!

Ya...<br><br>Woah, my bad <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  <br><br>I was -SO- not paying attention when I read your post, nor when I wrote my own. Yeesh!<br><br>Alright Kail. Thanks alot. <br><br>One last question though, do you think getting rid of those 2 monk levels for the 16th Druid is worth it? I am really torn between it after you told me about the 10% speed loss, the -1 AC, and ya... the fewer Stunning Attacks might hurt a bit, not to mention the 2 feats; though at the same time, Elemental Shape could really come in handy... alot. For RP reasons it is fun, though that is secondary when you can RP as a friggin' Dragon of your choice. The major reason, is that the Elemental is smaller, and provides an alternative choice to Dragon when a Dragon is simply not meneuverable, or not practical. It is more so for a tactical reason than a 'build' reason I guess.<br><br>Do you have a preference personally? Its really the 2 feats that gets me the most. Those could be really, really useful. But I dont want to get stuck in some forest where I cant move.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Okembour on 06/20/06 03:11</span></i></p>

Environment dictates some choices in builds and you are the one to know the best your environment.<br><br>This said I can offer you a little insight to make your choice. The loss in AC will be made up by the increased WIS from Owl's Insight (although the latter can get dispelled) so it may be a lesser concer for you. Elemental shape is handy indeed and it fits a druid, but remember also that you get it only 1/day at 16th lvl (and it's the Huge variant not the Elder). By getting more Druid you get 8th lvls spells and spell slots (you can now extend AoV). You'll have to lose 2 feats to keep KD/IKD, although there's a couple you might drop, given your preferences. Keep all these elements in mind when making your choice <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>If you go for more druid remember to go Druid 12/CoT 5/Monk 3 preepic, not to lose AB and the final monk skill dump. <br><br>My personal preference? I'd go for Monk 6, mainly because elemental shape is usable just once per day, but that's just me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  I can see the benefits of the alternative though and the choice is not so easy, I understand.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Wait for me Dragon, we'll meet in the sky<br>By fire and magic, I'm sworn<br>Hell is calling, we cannot be denied<br>Fly to the blackness of the Storm<br><br>We must die to be reborn!

I put some thought into it the other night and I decided that I need Elemental Shape. I will sacrifice some of the archery feats which I just don't need in the long run. Playability might be rougher but I can tolerate it. I want to RP it so that my abilities remain unknown to my enemies until a dramatic scenario arises where all of a sudden... BAM... a Dragon is eating their faces. But to do this, I need an alternative. Even if it is only once a day, it lasts a long while and the AC in Air Elemental will be very nice. <br><br>Thanks for all the help Kail. Really, thanks alot.<br><br>I was wondering though, if you could point me in the direction of a technical breakdown of the Dragonshape feat. I need to know a few things: <br><br>-What merges in that form. <br><br>-What components make up its AC (i.e. Dodge, Natural).<br><br>-What its Touch AC is, flat footed AC.<br><br>-All of its natural abilities and how and when they apply.<br><br>-Does the 40/+6 DR work for elements and other damage variants, or just physical (i.e. Piercing, Slashing Bludgeoning).<br><br>Stuff like that. Is there an FAQ about it somewhere? It would help alot. I dont want to have to pelt you with all my questions... I'm feeling guilty... so is there a segment on the feat?

When you say armor, does that include shields? And is that it? Rings? Helmet, belt, and/or boot properties?<br><br>And about the Touch AC... if it is so low, then wouldn't Harm be the end of that dragon? Is there any defence against it?

You meld armour, helmet and shield.

Is there any defence against harm? It seems pretty dumb that a Dragon with around 800HP and 72 AC, with around 40 to all of its saves will fall to a single touch of a Cleric who only has to pass an AC in the 40's. After all of the effort and power put into the Dragon... it basically just dies against a Cleric.<br><br>Am I missing something or is Harm the ultimate weapon?
