Even as a human I can't take 3 classes.  The monk lvl is at the end to pump discipline.. if you want.  I want this design to be playable and good at the same time.  Also, if I can't get epic dodge, there will be no point.  I am starved for feats as it is and taking less cleric lvls will eliminate the 2 bonus feats armor skin and great wis which end up giving me 3 extra ac.  Why does everyone love imp KD? Hmm.. I guess is because we are assuming it works.. I am used to everyone having imm to KD and monsters either being immune or having 100 discipline.  Just the mod I play on..

as I learned myself there are a lot of epic dodging cleric/monk/rogues around, I like my own better, but hey, they all work. I would definately go for more monk levels and try to squeeze som other classes in pre-epic for saves. how does C12/R4/M4 pre-epic sound? these builds can be tweaked to do different things, but maxing out saves/AB is advisable.<br><br>have fun.
