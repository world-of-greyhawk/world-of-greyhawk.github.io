This kind of build has been done before, but still I will post this one. This is what I ended up with while trying to create the best AB without any buffs. I tried to get the STR as high as possible while having 28 levels of Weapon master. Builds with RDD are out of the question. They will never have a BAB of 30, and will never be able to have 28 levels of WM. Their AB will be lower. If you know how to improve the unbuffed AB, please let me know <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  .<br><br>Anyway. Starting with 20 STR I was 1 feat short of having STR 38, so I settled with STR 36 and a positive CON modifier instead of a negative one.<br>In order to get the 7 Greater Strength feats, it is important to take all 'weapon' feats, like Epic Weapon Focus, Overwhelming and Devastating Critical on Weapon Master bonus feats.<br><br>Name: Gnarlic the Brute<br>Race: Half-Orc<br><br>Stats<br>STR:  19 --&gt; 36 (+10 Abilities, +7 Greater Strength)<br>DEX:  13<br>CON:  12<br>INT:  13<br>WIS:  8<br>CHA:  6<br><br>All ability increases go to STR<br><br>1	Fighter	Exotic Weapon Proficiency, Weapon focus (bastard sword)		<br>2	Fighter	Dodge		<br>3	Fighter	Mobilty		<br>4	Fighter	Expertise<br>5	Fighter			<br>6	Fighter	Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack<br>7	WM	Weapon of Choice (bastard sword)	<br>8	WM	<br>9	WM	Power Attack		<br>10	WM			<br>11	WM			<br>12	WM	Cleave<br>13	WM			<br>14	WM			<br>15	WM	Great Cleave		<br>16	WM<br>17	Fighter		<br>18	Fighter	Improved Critical (bastard sword), Disarm <br>19	Fighter		<br>20	Fighter	Improved Disarm<br>21	WM	Great Strength I	<br>22	WM		<br>23	WM	* Overwhelming Critical (bastard sword)	<br>24	WM	Great Strength II<br>25	WM		<br>26	WM	* Devastating Critical (bastard sword)	<br>27	WM	Great Strength III	<br>28	WM<br>29	WM	* Epic Weapon Focus (bastard sword)	<br>30	WM	Great Strength IV	<br>31	WM		<br>32	WM	* Epic Prowess<br>33	WM	Great Strength V		<br>34	WM			<br>35	WM	* Armor Skin		<br>36	WM	Great Strength VI<br>37	WM			<br>38	WM	* Epic Toughness<br>39	Rogue	Great Strength VII		<br>40	Rogue	<br>*: WM bonusfeats.<br><br>Skills: 40 points into tumble at lvl 39, 41 into discipline, the last points on lvl 38, 4 cross-classed into Intimidate on lvl 6.
