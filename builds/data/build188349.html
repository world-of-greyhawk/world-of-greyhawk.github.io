<b>Playable from level 1 - 40...PvM Build</b><br><br><br><i>The build should be playable from lvl 1-40 as long as there is decent magic available in the world. Should be no problem with the bioware campaigns. You get terrifying rage at lvl 24 (the earliest possible level) and you've also gotten epic skill focus (intimidate) at that point, so your fear aura should be effective against nearly all of the vulnerable monsters.<br><br>Play as a typical fighter for most of the pre-epic levels. You'll have a few bard buffs, but you really won't be much of a spellcaster and you'll only have a few bard songs. You'll need to buy decent armor, weapons, str and cha enhancing items. As you take the epic levels, you'll take many more bard levels and become more of a spellcaster and your bard song will have more of an effect on enemies.<br><br>The cleric level also causes an experience penalty, so you might want to do without that if you're playing a module with fixed experience. On a pw, or a module with respawns the penalty isn't as much of an issue.</i><br><br><br><br>The Terrifying Troubadour<br><br>This build is designed to have a very high DC terrifying rage.  To accomplish this, high charisma is used to boost the intimidate score.  Bard song also adds +11 to skills, allowing +11 more dc on terrifying rage.  Finally, the mind fog spell lowers enemy will saves by 10, allowing the fear aura to penetrate even further.  It is very unlikely that anything can resist paralyzation from the Troubadour's terrifying rage without immunity to fear, immunity to mind effects or immunity to paralyzation.  <br><br>(note: terrifying rage only paralyses enemies with less than your hitdie.  Others will be feared, which lowers their ab and saves, but doesn't paralyze)<br><br>Since the build has reasonably high cha, I decided to give him divine might.  This should help with enemies that are immune to the fear paralyzation (undead, etc...).<br><br>He should be able to hit reasonably high AC enemies by using curse song and taunt on them before attacking.  Taunt gets essentially a +22 boost from bardsong/curse song (+11 to my taunt skill, -11 to their concentration skill), so it should be very reliable against melee types, less so for mages due to their maxed concentration.<br><br>human, chaotic evil<br><br>str 16 (10)<br>dex 8<br>con 14 (6)<br>wis 8<br>int 12 (4)<br>cha 16 (10)<br><br>1. barbarian: weapon focus (scimitar), power attack<br>2. barbarian<br>3. barbarian: knockdown<br>4. barbarian: +str<br>5. barbarian<br>6. bard: curse song<br>7. barbarian<br>8. barbarian: +str<br>9. barbarian: improved critical (scimitar)<br>10. barbarian<br>11. barbarian<br>12. barbarian: blind-fight, +str<br>13. barbarian<br>14. barbarian<br>15. bard: still spell<br>16. bard: +str<br>17. bard<br>18. cleric: divine might<br>19. bard<br>20. barbarian: +str<br>21. bard: epic skill focus (intimidate)<br>22. bard<br>23. bard<br>24. barbarian: terrifying rage, +str<br>25. bard<br>26. bard<br>27. bard: epic weapon focus (scimitar)<br>28. bard: +str<br>29. bard<br>30. bard: epic skill focus (perform)<br>31. bard<br>32. bard: +str<br>33. bard: epic prowess<br>34. bard<br>35. bard<br>36. bard: lasting inspiration, +cha<br>37. bard<br>38. bard<br>39. bard: great cha 1, great cha 2<br>40. barbarian: +cha<br><br>str 24<br>dex 8<br>con 14<br>wis 8<br>int 12<br>cha 20<br><br>43 intimidate<br>42 perform<br>40 tumble<br>15 umd<br>39 spellcraft<br>43 taunt<br>34 discipline<br><br>bard song:<br>lvl 23 bard needs 65 perform for +12 skills<br>42 perform<br>10 epic skill focus<br>11 cha 32 cha with +12 from items/buffs<br>-----<br>63 -&gt; +11 skills, +12 with minstrel gloves<br><br>terrifying rage dc:<br>43 intimidate<br>10 epic skill focus<br>11 cha<br>11 bard song<br>10 mind fog (lowers enemy will save)<br>3 curse song (lowers enemy will save)<br>1-10 roll added<br>------------<br>89-98<br><br>max possible ab<br>27 bab<br>13 str (36 str with items/buffs)<br>3 epic weapon focus<br>1 epic prowess<br>2 bard song<br>2 war cry<br>5 gmw<br>5 curse song<br>6 taunt<br>-------------<br>64<br><br>ac <br>10 base<br>8 fullplate<br>3 tower shield<br>1 dex (12 dex with cat's grace)<br>8 tumble<br>5 bard song<br>4 mage armor<br>---------------<br>39<br><br>hps <br>192 barbarian<br>138 bard<br>8 cleric<br>40 con<br>---------<br>378<br><br>important spells:<br>mage armor<br>protection from alignment<br>bull's strength<br>cat's grace<br>eagle's spendour<br>greater magic weapon<br>keen edge<br>wounding whispers<br>improved invisibility<br>war cry<br>mind fog<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 05/27/05 16:26</span></i></p>

The one level of cleric won't give much access to spells anyway. One level of RDD won't give too much either.

rdd requires 10 levels to be effective.  You need at least 15 barbarian levels to get terrifying rage.  That leaves only 15 bard levels, which reduces the effect of the bard song (only +3 skills).  rdd also grants +2 cha, so you'll get one more point of intimidate.  You'll probably want 16 barbarian levels so you can top off the intimidate skill, otherwise you must delay terrifying rage until level 39 to get decent intimidate ranks.<br><br>The cleric level is there to obtain turn undead.  Cleric is the only way to get that with one level.  <br><br>You're not going to use divine spells at all, so 8 wisdom doesn't really matter too much.  With only one cleric level and 8 wis, you're giving up 3 cantrips and 3 level 1 spells.  I guess bless could come in handy, although the duration is really short. perhaps a +1 divine favor would help a little bit.  feel free to swap around the ability points to get 11 wisdom if so desired.  I prefer to use bless and aid potions to get my +2 ab... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Another way to go is to use paladin instead of cleric.  You need 3 paladin levels to obtain turn undead for divine might.  You'll also get divine grace, which will give you +11 to saves.  with barb 16/bard 21/paladin 3 you can still get most everything vital to the build.  You lose one epic bard bonus feat and your bardsong is only +9 skills due to the loss of bard levels.  You also have to deal with law/chaos alignment shifts to use paladin, which is impossible in most modules.<br><br>You could also drop the cleric level and take 17 barbarian and gain +1 dr.

hehe. for a single level prc instead of cleric you have three choices:<br><br>cot, rdd, or palemaster.<br><br>I don't think you qualify for any others.<br><br>palemaster gives +2 ac, not bad<br>cot gives lay on hands<br>rdd gives +1 ac, might as well go palemaster...<br><br>I like cleric better for divine might, since it synergizes with the cha needed for bard spells and intimidate/perform modifiers.  cot's lay on hands will be enhanced by the cha as well.  <br><br>seems like xp penalty is worth it, but that really depends on your play environment.  If you really want to avoid the xp penalty, I'd recommend taking 17 barbarian or palemaster.

Dark Blessing would give you the save bonus, you would get a free Bulls Strength and if you really need it a Ghast.  You also don't have to worry about the law/chaos shift, or xp penalty.  Also if you took them pre-epic you could boost your BAB.  I may give this some more thought....
