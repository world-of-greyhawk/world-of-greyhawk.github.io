Singing, Slashing &amp; Slinging his way (1-40) PvM or PvP, Sling Blade is an epic fighting bard. <br><br><br>THE SLING BLADE (Song Version)<br>By Deborah Tyr<br><br>Sling Blade is a maestro, a musician and composer, who went off to knight school to learn the art of combat. While attending knight college, Sling Blade never forgot his first love, however, that of the musical arts. In between sharpening his blade and practicing his song, our fighting maestro happened across an ancient book one day, while in the library. He had been seeking more information about the basics of jousting, to prepare for an upcoming test while the other knights simply worked out in the court yard; but this book, this ancient dust-covered book, caught our maestro’s attention. Judging by the dust that had gathered on it, and by its tattered and torn appearance, this book had without question been tossed aside and ignored as if it contained no useful knowledge; unforgotten and shelved, it had been neglected for the better part of a century. Perhaps it was his artistic senses, his well tuned eye or musical intuition that led our maestro to pick up the book; or maybe it was something else. Whatever the reason for his fascination, Sling Blade could not help but pick it up.<br><br>Blowing it clear of dust and opening its cover, Sling realized, in an instant, that in his hands were all the military pearls of wisdom that any knight, or great military general for that matter, could ever hope to come across in a life time; there, in its worn and yellowed pages, having stood the tests of time and reduced to writing, was to be found everything that could ever be dreamed of by the greatest of generals, in war time, and in peace; this book, this ancient and until now forgotten little book, contained the greatest tactical military truths of all time. Appropriately, it was entitled: “The Art of War.” <br><br>Written by Sun Tzu, a 5th century master-warrior tactician, Sling Blade immediately set about to read it, carefully, slowly and studiously, he read each passage in the book, again and again, and from cover to cover. In so doing, our maestro learned that what is essential in war is victory, not prolonged operations, and that victory requires not combat per se but, rather, respect, versatility and preparedness. He also realized that, although he was by all accounts a good knight, well on the path to becoming a highly trained warrior, that it was not such skills alone that were responsible for his success in battle; rather, it was his musical compositions and singing performance. Each time he had sung for an audience, he knew that he had moved them, that he had touched their hearts and their minds with his song; a gifted musician he was, who had always been able to make a lasting impression on his audience. As a crier on the battlefield, too, when he sang his war song before engaging the enemy with his sword, he knew that his music had a similar and lasting effect in combat, in the same way that he had always managed to move an entire auditorium: and so, he sang. He sang his beautiful bard song: inspiring himself and his allies in battle while, at the same time, striking pandemonium and fear into the hearts and minds of his enemies. <br><br>On coming to this realization, he intuitively understood Sun Tzu’s teachings; he understood that the best offense is defense, which requires versatility and constant vigilance; he understood the need to respect, and to understand the enemy; and he understood that perhaps which was even more important. This being: whatever may come in battle, it was paramount to remain adaptable, as this is what it means to be prepared. Sling Blade realized that, as a musician, he had always understood the Art of War. And on that day, he realized that he no longer needed to remain in knight school, but could instead return to his first love, that of the musical arts, with which he could perfect the Art of War.<br><br>AUTHOR's NOTE: Sling Blade is the fourth and final character in the fighting bard series. Based on the tale of King Arthur and Celtic lore, the characters in this series are in answer to the following question: when a musician goes to knight school, which is more powerful, the song or the sword?  With this character, the Sling Blade, we focus on the song. Yet we do so without entirely neglecting our combat prowess, so far as he has decent, buffable combat AB (augmented by IKD and called shot, and which AB he can also self-buff to cap). With good buffable AC, decent saves, decent HPs, a nice assortment of defense-focused skills, and the ability to dish out some decent combat damage, Sling can hold his own in melee combat, without being forced to rely on spells, which makes him an adaptable ‘Fighting Bard’ within the theme of this series. That having been said, his real talent is of course the bardic/arcane theme, including his high bard song, which is a lasting song; combined with UMD versatility and his ability to sling different damage types, Sling Blade makes for a fun-filled character, able to fly solo or as a member of a party, and adaptable to most any environment. <br><br>Without further adieu, meet Sling Blade: the Fighting Bard with the Sweet and Lasting Song in our series. As always, I welcome all your great comments, ideas, and suggestions <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      <br><br>SLING BLADE (Fighting Bard – SONG version) <br>Champion of Torm(15), Bard(21), Fighter(4), <br>Race: Human  / Alignment: Neutral Good Preferred<br><br>FINAL STATS:<br>STR: 16 (30)<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 14 (16)<br><br>Hitpoints: 436 (+26 Singing, or: 462)<br><br><br><br>Saving Throws:<br>Fort:	31, +2 Song<br>Will : 	26 (28 Owl’s), +3 Song<br>Reflex: 	30 (32 Cat’s), +2 Song<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4 (+5 Singing)<br><br>Other Enhancements:<br>Resistance: +1 All Saves <br>Protection: +2 All Saves and Immunity to Mind-Effects<br>Divine Wrath: +7 All Saves (5 Rounds w.

Cool, I like it. I'd drop Maximize Spell for something - anything - else, though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">  It's hardly useful. Empower Spell is a choice, although I'd go for something other then a third metamagic, I mean you're not a caster <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif"><br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a>

Finn: thanks! Yeah, he's pretty cool me thinks, too; must thank Nimueh for 'pushing' me on this, if you will, to make a fighting laster (I loaded him in accordance with Tzu's philosophy, with you to thank for inspiring me on the rogue/listen twist: thanks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">        <br><br>As to maximize: my thought on that was, hey, since we got a couple (okay, not a ton, but a couple <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">         of nice damage spells, like Bard Ice: area of effect spell in which all enemies take 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage +9d6 points of cold damage (or, 72 damage, no save, and its empowered), thinkin' it'd be a real pain for, well, everyone really, but especially those caster types, no? <br><br>True, we’re not a sorc/wiz, but still . . . as to what to take in lieu of it; hmmm, empower’s an interesting option (would give us the extra point, thus a +3 instead of the +2 boosts to i.e., bard buffs, yes?) – that'd be nice, so too would be save boost feats. Since he has divine wrath and UMD though, skill focus (ie perform or disc. or listen ie., Tzu-ist thinkin’) probably the better option, if don't want maximize (thanks, Finn!). <br><br>One of the nice things about using COT instead of WM here (note: the three other knights in the series all use WM) is that we get nice feat selections, and reason why I switched over to COT on this one (but, note to Nimueh, as we discussed in the Song Blade build, WM is still a nice choice for a laster, though, notwithstanding, I agree, since either combo gets ya a laster w. decent, buffable combat AB that when all buffed and adjusted, works out to AB +80 - Cool! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">        <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/23/06 16:09:22 (GMT) -- Nimueh_Leafbow<br>…It's true that buff-dependant AB is less reliable than unbuffed AB (as compared i.e., to the Song Blade, with his natural, unbuffed stats), but I think such effects are minimized when your buffs/debuffs last 15 minutes and you can use them 20 times/day.  And even if it is a problem...is the loss of (a couple or so unbuffed) AB really enough to keep (a high, lasting bard) build from being a Fighting Bard?<br><br>…Sling Blade, by the way, it's an admirable alternative (to a WM combo)...and I'd still call it a Fighting Bard <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">          .</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Thanks, Nim!

edit: OOPS, on his spell stuff, in the comment above, should read he has extend spell, not empowered (though, as Finn points out, empower's an option; however, and knowing him, if we drop max., I'm thinkin' skill focus (listen, disc., or perform) could work out nicely (or, if you've something else in mind, by all means...); thanks, guys (as always, appreciate those comments! ~ Tyr <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/24/06 20:21</span></i></p>
