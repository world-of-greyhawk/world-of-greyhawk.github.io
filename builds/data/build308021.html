+4 AB for being a level 15 Barbarian sounds pretty nice.<br><br>I assume that you take Elf because it's a PvP build and the XP penalty doesn't matter, but I don't see any particular reason not to take Halfing or Human.<br><br>I also don't see why you take 10 levels of Monk, 2 more Rogue levels can net your the bonus feat for Improved Evasion plus a higher sneak attack with the loss of only 1 AC. Actually, since you're a DEX kama monk with a high amount of APR, I'd take a good look at your damage sources. Your base damage without sneaks is quite low, any amount of DR would be awful, I think you could really advantage from lowering Monk, a lot of it, in favor of Rogue. That's just to keep the cheese, though your AC would be better if you dropped Monk altogether and grabbed a shield.<br><br>Besides, switching from lawful to non-lawful so many times sounds a bit unrealistic to actually make the build.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 04/11/09 22:53</span></i></p>

Was made more for arena/pvp orientated servers so alignment restrictions tend to be removed (with the exceptions being BG/Pally of course).<br><br>Also monk was taken for the speed bonus more then anything else as where I play HiPs is disabled and stealthers tend to corner sneak making monk speed rather valuable for sneak builds like this.<br><br>As for the damage it is rather low as it's a dex based build however again since it was intended for pvp servers it's not all that uncommon to have 1-3 elemental damages on weapons that combined with your sneaks and crippling strike (BEST skill ever) is usually enough to kill non PM/DR builds.

Stealth might be fine, but once you lose that...its all down to how much pain you can give and recieve.

I'd agree with Grizz here. Unless you play it on a server without any alignment restrictions at all, it's practically impossible really.<br><br>Skilldumping with monk in a barb build isn't really a good thing to do. In this case, even in a PvP server, you'd have to take more Barb and monk in groups, they aren't really interchangeable.<br><br>To make it PvM friendly you have little choice. Take 16 Barb levels straight up. Then take 4 monk. Then you'll have only one alignment change, no xp-penalty until lvl 16 and if you in Epic tries to balance Rogue and Monk you'll have 20% xp-penalty more of the way instead of 40%.<br><br>You'll get the same end result, but about a year or so faster. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again
