Since I haven't posted in this thread for awhile... a treat for you Lich lovers.<br><br>A shifter of great power (who excels in risen lord form)<br><br>This is different than the standard "monk" shifter; instead it takes advantage of the Weapon Master's ability to take more than one weapon of choice.<br><br>Human Druid 7 / Shifter 11 / Weapon Master 22 (i really wanted to Druid 7 / Shifter 17 / Weapon Master 16 and do longsword + scythe as an elf, but I was short one feat no matter how hard I tried. I could sacrifice 4 attacks per round for it... but would it be worth it? How often would I prefer to use advanced drow over risen lord? Not often enough to make it useful.)<br><br>SKILLS: Tumble (cross-skill), Spot (shifter/WM), Spellcraft (druid, up to 22 (you'll have to cross skill some of it)), Concentration (druid/shifter, up to 28), Discipline (WM), Hide (shifter, up to 28), Move Silently (cross-skill). You will have skills left over.<br><br>STR 14<br>DEX 14<br>CON 14<br>WIS 14<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8<br><br>(dex is the only stat that doesn't change in risen lord form, so raise that primarily)<br><br>Level 1 - Druid (Dodge, Expertise)<br>Level 2 - Druid<br>Level 3 - Druid (Alertness)<br>Level 4 - Druid (DEX up, 15)<br>Level 5 - Druid (Wild Shape!)<br>Level 6 - Shifter (Mobility)<br>Level 7 - Shifter<br>Level 8 - Shifter (DEX up, 16)<br>Level 9 - Shifter (Spring Attack)<br>Level 10 - Shifter<br>Level 11 - Shifter<br>Level 12 - Shifter (Whirlwind Attack, DEX up, 17)<br>Level 13 - Shifter<br>Level 14 - Druid<br>Level 15 - Druid (Weapon Focus: Scimitar)<br>Level 16 - Weapon Master (DEX up, 18)<br>Level 17 - Weapon Master<br>Level 18 - Weapon Master (weapon proficiency: exotic)<br>Level 19 - Weapon Master<br>Level 20 - Weapon Master (DEX up, 19)<br>---<br>Level 21 - Weapon Master (weapon focus: scythe)<br>Level 22 - Shifter<br>Level 23 - Shifter<br>Level 24 - Shifter (Undead Shape, DEX up, 20)<br>Level 25 - Weapon Master<br>Level 26 - Weapon Master<br>Level 27 - Weapon Master (Knockdown)<br>Level 28 - Weapon Master (DEX up, 21)<br>Level 29 - Weapon Master<br>Level 30 - Weapon Master (Improved Knockdown)<br>Level 31 - Weapon Master * (Weapon of Choice: Scythe)<br>Level 32 - Weapon Master (DEX up, 22)<br>Level 33 - Weapon Master (Improved Critical: Scythe)<br>Level 34 - Weapon Master * (Epic Weapon Focus: Scythe)<br>Level 35 - Weapon Master<br>Level 36 - Weapon Master (Blind-Fight, DEX up, 23)<br>Level 37 - Weapon Master * (Epic Armor Skin)<br>Level 38 - Weapon Master<br>Level 39 - Weapon Master (Epic Energy Resistance: Fire or Acid, you choose.)<br>Level 40 - Weapon Master * (Epic Prowess, DEX up, 24)<br>---<br><br>So as you can see, this build is a power house with 50% reduction against piercing and slashing weapons, spell resistance of 20, all undead immunities, a natural +5 scythe (so use a scythe that has good item properties) and can use a chaos shield with his scythe. The disadvantage is lower AC than normal builds (only caps out around 55 or so with the right spells) but makes up for it with immunities, damage reduction, heavy BAB and damage, a whole lot of HP, and chaos shield.<br><br>Disadvantages: Just as fast/slow as normal people, slightly lower AC than normal people (and wisdom shifters), no dev crit (but cannot be dev critted), slow to develop (level 31), not as good in other forms (unlike wisdom shifters who can use construct forms and such), only get up to undead shape, is vulnerable to undead-only attacks (such as sun burst, searing light vs undead).<br><br>Advantages: Can use many of the shapes semi-effectively (though of course specializes in risen lord), has item/weapon/armor merging ability, high BAB, high damage, high HP, immunities, etc.<br><br>~ Lock.<br>_________________<br>"Life builds you up just to burn you down." - 3rd Strike, Hang On.<br><br>Prestige Class Consortium<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 17:00</span></i></p>

The risen lord wm is really a great combo, but as mentionned earlier, his ac is really low. Then, imo, it can be more efficient to get some Dr with the risen lord immunites.<br><br>I dont want to highjack this thread as anyway, this is a similar build, but with a slight variation on it. As good in offense, but better in defense with the 3 epic dr feats :<br><br>CLASSES:<br> - druid (8)<br> - Shifter(10)<br> - Weapon Master (22)<br><br>ABILITIES:<br>  Str: 12<br>  Dex: 18<br>  Con: 22<br>  Int: 14<br>  Wis: 14<br>  Cha: 08<br><br>STARTING ABILITIES:<br>  Str: 12 <br>  Dex: 16 <br>  Con: 12 <br>  Int: 14 <br>  Wis: 14 <br>  Cha: 08 <br><br>------------------------------<br>Level 1 - druid	- Dodge- Expertise<br>Level 2 - druid<br>Level 3 - druid	- Alertness<br>Level 4 - druid	+1Dex<br>Level 5 - druid<br>Level 6 - Shifter   - Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>Level 7 - Shifter<br>Level 8 - Shifter   +1Dex<br>Level 9 - Shifter   - Mobility<br>Level 10 - Shifter<br>Level 11 - Shifter<br>Level 12 - Shifter   +1Con	- Spring Attack<br>Level 13 - Shifter<br>Level 14 - druid<br>Level 15 - Shifter   - Whirlwind Attack<br>Level 16 - Weapon Master	+1Con	- Weapon of choice Scimitar<br>Level 17 - Weapon Master<br>Level 18 - Weapon Master	- weapon proficiency: exotic<br>Level 19 - Weapon Master<br>Level 20 - Weapon Master<br>Level 21 - Weapon Master	- weapon focus: scythe<br>Level 22 - Weapon Master<br>Level 23 - Weapon Master<br>Level 24 - Shifter   +1 Con - Undead Shape<br>Level 25 - Weapon Master<br>Level 26 - Weapon Master<br>Level 27 - Weapon Master	- Improved Critical: Scythe<br>Level 28 - Weapon Master	+1Con<br>Level 29 - Weapon Master	- Weapon of choice scythe- Greater Con I<br>Level 31 - Weapon Master<br>Level 32 - Weapon Master	+1Con	- Epic Prowess<br>Level 33 - Weapon Master	- Greater Con II<br>Level 34 - Weapon Master<br>Level 35 - Weapon Master	- Epic Armor Skin<br>Level 36 - Weapon Master	+1Con	- Epic DR I<br>Level 37 - Weapon Master<br>Level 38 - Weapon Master	- Epic DR II<br>Level 39 - druid	- Epic DR III<br>Level 40 - druid	+1Con<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Anglashell on 05/13/07 09:13</span></i></p>

Anglashell, <br><br>I dont see EWF: Scythe on your build and it also loses the 4th attack per round. Should probably drop a Great Con feat and pick up EWF. And go 7 Druid/8 Shifter/5 WM pre-epic to keep the 4th attack per round.

Bilbo's build:<br><br>Replace lvl 22 or 23 shifter with a Druid level.<br><br>You only need 10 shifter levels to get Risen.  Having 11 in this build adds nothing.  Take an 8th Druid level instead and you get 2 more spells and a little more duration.
