A small question on bigby's line of spells.   Those spells have no saving throw but if your str is high enough you can resist the correct?  You also have the option to have your spell resistance high enough to save against it correct?<br><br>I am going to try build a melee fighter that at least has an attempt to avoid getting pinned by those ugly green hands .

For Bigby's Grasping Hand, you must first hit the target, with a check of <b>1d20 + caster level + (casting ability modifier + 10) minus 1 vs. target's armor class.</b><br><br>Then, to grapple the target, you must succeed with a check of <b>1d20 + caster level + (casting ability modifier + 10) + 4 vs. 1d20 + target's BAB + target's strength modifier + target's grapple size modifier.</b><br><br>Bigby's Forceful Hand is simply an STR check, with a mod of 14.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By mantis3 on 06/07/07 19:11</span></i></p>
