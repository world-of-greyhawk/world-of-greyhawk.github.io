Perhaps someone could help me here, I am looking for a build that can go toe to toe with a High level PM. I have tired a fighter/Sor/RDD. Also tried a fighter/wm/cot<br>and in PvP, I was destroyed. I have look over the builds posted, as well as check Nwikki, to gain a understanding, but i am lost. Any help would be appreciated.

As Kail said, use a mage, you won't care about AC when you use spells, so a caster is definitely the best, but if you want it the hard way, there might be a posibility.<br><br>What happens is his AC is probably amazingly high isn't it? for high ACs you need to go Arcane Archer, if he's a good player he might also use Epic Warding which makes it even worse, you won't deal damage even if you hit... you might be able to hit and deal damage through with a Paladin / Wizard / Arcane Archer, buffing with Divine Might and True Strike. If that doesn't works then just use a caster, there's no way around of it, if AA can't hit him and damage him, probably nothing can.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 09/29/07 03:22</span></i></p>

Touch attacks will do too, all that Natural AC will go down the flush. Implosion is a good solution too.<br><br>But to give better advice, what PM heavy build are we talking about exactly?<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die
