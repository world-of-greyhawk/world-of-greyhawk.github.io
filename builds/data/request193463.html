Hello all,<br><br>I really would like to built a dwarven slayer, but alas, i'm not very good at it. Can someone please post an epic buildt for a dwarven slayer.<br>I would like it to have barbarian(rage) and ranger{for favoured enemies) as his classes. Maybey DWD too? Thx in advance.<br><br><br>oh almost forgot and a great axe as his main weapon. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kraven Khor on 05/03/05 18:32</span></i></p>

hmm, iafter a little research maybe it would be better to have two battleaxes because of the free dual wield.and favoured enemies should be greenskins offcourse. and also DWD is not an option cause char has to be chaotic neutraul, and you have to lawfull for DWD.
