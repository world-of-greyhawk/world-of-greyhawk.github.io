Cleric 20 / Monk 1 / Rogue 19, take Epic Dodge and dual wield kamas, it rocks.

I like the "Rogue Archer" in the main bioware epic build section.

My two favorites are my "Sneaky Hobbit" build (Rogue 25/Fighter 10/SD 5, dex-based) or Grizz's "Zhentarim Field Agent" (Rogue 25/Fighter 14/SD 1, Str-based halfling wielding a scim as a 2-handed weapon). The dex-based one is a bit better in terms of skills and much better in terms of AC, but can have a tough time against sneak-immune or high-DR enemies. The str-based one can get into trouble against ED/SCV builds, but can dish out some serious damage. He's as good as a str-based fighter against sneak-immunes, and can dish out far more than most fighter builds to anything sneak-susceptible (13d6 sneaks on top of 15 points of str-bonus, and 6 from EWS, and a 12-20 crit range, means he can finish off most sneak-susceptible enemies in 1 round following a successful IKD from stealth).<br><br>TM

Oh, if you like Monk/Assassin, you should also try Monk 9/SD 5/Assassin 26. You get HiPS and Epic Dodge that way, and still have an excellent Death Attack DC.<br><br>TM

Fighter/CoT/Rogue is most excellent and playable even for beginners. Both Dex and STR versions. Fighter/SD/Rogue as mentioned. I like the Dex based Halfling of Doom, my revised Rogue13/SD1/Assassin26.

I don't know if I have a favorite.  I think Dwarven Rogues are hands-down my favorite style.  And I think Dwarven Rogues with Epic Dodge and 500+ Hit Points one of my all time favorites.... but really, any Rogue heavy build is good in my book.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I loved the Grizz's Rogue with Epic Dodge and Self Concealment V... Besides, that build uses a dwarf, something I never saw...<br><br>Great build!
