I've decided to post another version, using a longsword and dagger, but both dex &amp; str based. So far, I've only figured out 2 classes, and want the help of everyone who complained in my previous one to figure out a thir.<br><br>So far I'm sticking with a Fighter 10/Rogue 17 (with epic will, slippery mind and epic dodge). The third class I'm leaning towards is WM 13, unless anyone can convince me of a better class to take (and I'll be glad to take it, I don't like wasting 4 feats in a build that needs them so much). <br><br>Problem with this build is that it is rather feat starved, and with only a STR of 18, it has what could ony be labelled as a pathetic AB.

I know this is a potentially dumb question, but who is Artemis Enteri, exactly?

Artemis Entreri is an Assassin from R.A.Salvatore's Drizzt Saga. Essentially, he would play the role of Drizzt's rival.

Yea,  losing the Wm would free up a lot of feats and stat points.  Fighter/rogue/assasin would be the best combo.  Plus,  if you got WM in the longsword,  Art's signature item is the life sucking dagger.
