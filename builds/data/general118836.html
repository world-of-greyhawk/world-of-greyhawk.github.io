Do anyone have any idea for two unused forums?<br><br>I am considering about making one of them into "Final ECB" where you post your final and complete build. Although that wouldn't happen because most of the time we find something that would make the build even better than what the current one is by altering one of the feats with something else, etc.<br><br>Also, second idea was to make the forum into a "Epic Battle of Wills" which is where you post the result of the battle between two different epic character. The battle would be done on the server, just a small module that has complete set(Forest, Rural, Winter Rural, etc) for good test of the character(IE; some areas are best for the stealth while others are not).<br><br>IE;<br><br>Puff the Magic Dragon v.s. Leviathan the Dragon<br><br>Outcome: Three rounds of battle<br><br>First: Puff the Magic Dragon<br>Second: Leviathan the Dragon<br>Third: Puff the Magic Dragon<br><br>Puff the Magic Dragon is the winner of the "EBoW".<br><br>I know the example above is not good one, but it is one that I can think of at the moment.<br><br>However, the idea above would require some works from some builders who is willing to do the test and the battle, building the module, etc etc.<br><br>So while both of my ideas would sound good, but it requires some work which some don't like doing...<br><br>What do you all think?<br><br>Anuis

OK, some ideas..<br><br>First, I don't think we should rule out CEP builds entirely.  We don't have to be an exact copy of the looking for excellent character builds' thread.  As long as they are kept separate from the regular builds I don't see the problem. The CEP makes the brownie and wemic models fully-compatible with clothing, armor and such, except for capes on wemics, which is no biggie, so I think quite a few servers will end up having Wemic and Brownie PCs, so it would be worthwhile having some builds for them *shrugs* I personally would like to some anyway. I used to play a Wemic in PnP and it was a lot of fun...in fact, if anyone can direct me to a server that has the Wemic PC option, please let me know <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> I wasn't aware that you can make wacky +10 stat races with CEP. In any case, anything like that would be adifferent category altogether, sounds like a hacked character to me. Perhaps it would even be useful to see what a good hacked character looks like <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>The other major thing for me is getting some sort of arrangement with a PW or setting up our own module, whatever works, so we could get online and 'wear' whatever build we wanted, definite PvP possibilities and if its a PW we could do all kinds of stuff <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  cdualepp seems to have some kind of arrangement with a PW, would be cool if we could get a similar deal. I don't know the rulers very well where I play unfortunately, so if anybody has any ideas along those lines, please post them here! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

How about a section on char building tips?<br><br>Things like Clerics should stop putting points into WIS once they reach XX because it will no longer help or Paladins should put as many points into CHR as they can spare because it determines your Lay On Hands amount, etc.<br><br>I haven't built enough chars to make good suggestions, but I'm sure (judging by the builds I've seen), many of you could make intelligent suggestions.<br><br>Bill<br>_________________<br>"Therefore, said Arthur unto Sir Bedivere, take thou Excalibur, my good sword, and go with it to yonder water side ..."

Much as I love the level 40 builds, how about a section devoted to the slightly-less-than-all-powerful level 30 character builds? There are still some of us that like the process of gaining new strengths as using them <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Certainly for me, half the fun of a character is the journey *to* the final awe-inspiring powers. How about a section about characters than are fun to play and develop - that managed to be powerful during their journey, as well as at the end? Obviously, they don't have to be devestating at *every* level, but how about some that can match pretty much anyone else a 5 level increments from levels 5 to 30?<br><br>That should be a fair challenge to some of you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  After all, as terrifying as some of the builds are, the majority of their powers really only come into play at the highest levels.<br><br>I realise that this kinda goes against the epic-ness of this whole guild (but only a little - plenty of rom for epicness at 30), but I'm just chucking a few ideas out.<br><br>*hides*<br><br>PS : Hello everyone, from a longtime Bioware devotee/lurker.

It was talked about in the Epic Character Builds v6 (I think) where torias talked about starting a bunch of "Pure Builds" to feature on the NW Wednesdays. I.E. Pure Wizard, Sorc, Palemaster ect... <br><br>In the case of the epic classes limit the MultiClass to the requirments.  Example, for a Red Dragon build it would have ONLY sorcerer or bard levels along with the RDD levels.<br><br>A "Pure Builds" board would allow us to get a jump on this.<br>_________________<br>Wizard's First Rule: People are stupid.

I think a forum for builds that deviate from the ECB format would be a great idea..for one thing, the builds in the thread are built 'naked' not considering magic equipment, but as Torias pointed out, magical gear is available in virtually all gameplay situations..in some cases, this limitation effects feat and spell selection significantly..also some of the builds are not built with adventuring in mind and are very difficult to level manually in a PW environment, my poor 'Undead Lord' is stuck at level 3 or 4 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">   ..so a forum for 'adventuring builds' or somesuch would be a great resource I think <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>And I still favour the idea of a forum for builds using the Prestige Class Consortium classes and perhaps some of the custom races, nothing hacked or obviously way overpowered, but additional class/race options that are not fully supported by Bioware but are commonly available and used by at least a few PWs, just my thoughts <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   ...**edit**perhaps a forum for any build this is somehow illegal or relies upon an exploit along with non-standard classes, this might even be a good place for the builds which require wild alignment changes as well..and it would help in an organizational sense too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>The general character-building tips is a good idea too, but I think it could be a topic rather than a whole forum <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   **edit** Same for the 'pure' builds IMHO, perhaps a separate index if Anuis is willing? or if somebody can teach me how? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>So my vote is for an 'adventuring builds' forum for PvM builds, keeping in mind slow levelling and the availability of magic items, whether it be for the solo campaigns, a module or a persistent world environment...and another builds forum where anything goes: exploits, custom races, custom classes, whatever <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br> <br>Mainly we need more participation and discussion from our members if we're going to accomplish anything besides a list of builds <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>So what do YOU think? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By billb0 on 04/16/04 16:14</span></i></p>

Developing character builds that are fun to play at all (or at least most) levels, rather than just trying for the perfect 40th lvl character.  I'd find something along those lines, so I could consider what type of character I'd want to build in a campaign, much much more helpful.  Frankly, I had thought that was what this guild and the supercharacter builds Bioware is posting were going to be about.  I could care less about an uber 40th lvl character if no fun (or impossible) to legitimately get him/her/it there.

As a suggestion, make a specialty builds forum where each thread caters to a specific PW or specific set of parameters.<br><br>Currently, I play on a server that is really low magic, slow leveling and restricts character builds by allowing only multiclassing to one PrC to one base class.  For example you can have a wizard palemaster but not a wizard rogue and definitely no tri-classes.<br><br>It would be nice to have a thread that would suggest suitable effective builds for this world.  I think all PWs have little idiosyncracies that could greatly influence a build so maybe a forum to discuss this would be nice.
