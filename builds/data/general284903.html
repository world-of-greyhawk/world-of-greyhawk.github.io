Hey all.  As many of you know, i am a cleric fan.  I spend almost ALL of my time playing with a cleric of some kind.   That leaves me with little knowledge of other classes!  Druid is one class i have ignored for as long as I have played nwn.   As and proper cleric should, this is my repentance! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Also, as many of you know, I play PRC rules on the server i inhabit.  This has opened up a few interesting avenues to explore, namely, a Dragon with Devastating Critical.  No, prc doesnt change the rules to get Dragon shape (via a Druid), you still need 30 wisdom AND 25 str for dev crit.  It can be done!  Trust me.  <br><br>What I am wondering is this: is monk the only real third class for a druid dragon build?  It seems alot of dragons use monk for the ac boost, but I was wondering from those who play dragons IF it is really necessary to use monk?<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

You don't need to, however, it's a lot better to take Monk, two reasons:<br><br>1: You get 5 APR with your Druid BAB, plus Flurry of Blows for being a Monk, you can get another APR if you pick a third class with max BAB and level up pre-epic to get 16 pre-epic BAB, but that's independent from being Monk, the thing is your dragon will deal more damage for being a Monk.<br><br>2: The base requirement to be a dragon is 30 WIS, that means for being a monk you get minimum +15 AC, and Owl's Inisght increases WIS by an amount equal to half your Druid level, that caps WIS at Druid level 24, but since you need minimum 14 Druid levels to take dragon that's only +7. So your minimum buffed AC is +18, and about +24 if you really increase WIS and Druid levels, you can't deny that's an impressively big boost that will be lost if you don't take Monk, I'm not talking about "a bit of AC bonus", that much AC is worth it.<br><br>Summary: Monk is the most powerful class to pick on a dragon, and in most cases, a dragon with Monk levels will beat a dragon without Monk levels, as simple as that.<br><br>I know you can get Dev Crit and Dragon Shape with a Bard / Druid / Red Dragon Disciple, though I think you can also achieve it with Druid / Monk / Champion of Torm, which would be a lot better, but I haven't calculated if you can or not...<br><br>EDIT: If you're asking for playability from those who have played Druids, Monk also boost playability, after Druid level 5 take 1 Monk level and all your shapes will become a force to be reckoned with since low levels. Druids are fairly good casters, so you can make it without Monk, it's not really so hard, but Monk is just the best you can find, boosts APR, AC and playability all with just one level, what else can you ask for?<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 10/14/07 05:23</span></i></p>

A great 2nd and 3rd class for druid drakeshape is ranger and shadowdancer. Ranger helps the damage output with favored enemies + bane of enemies and there is nothing worse than a drake that blinks in and out of sight.

Many classes are useless for a dragon, Monk is the best, but sure there are other good ones, Cleric, Ranger, Rogue, Assassin, Wizard and Champion of Torm are the best third classes IMO.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

thanks guys.  My build is goin to be druid/brawler/cot.<br><br>Brawler is a nasty little class, that when mixed with druid gives you a super swecret feat that you dont get to choose or take, but shows up IF you do the right things!!   But thats a PRC thing.<br><br>Peace<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->
