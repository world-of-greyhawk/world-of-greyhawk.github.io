Firstly, apologies if the name upsets anyone - Moderators please feel free to adjust if need be.<br><br><b>The Obstinate Bugger</b><br>Rogue(16), Fighter(14), Champion of Torm(10)<br>Dwarf<br>PvM 1-40<br><br>I finally took the plunge and built myself a rogue, fighter, CoT. Currently playing him now on a PW and I have to say it is a delight watching him go. Personally I usually favour sword and board over a large weapon, mainly due to the Drop in AC, but so far so good. Thanks go to others who have gone the Ro/F/CoT route before me for valuable insight and tips (In particular Grizz, Cinnabar and Kaliban - for their Strength based versions).<br><br>Lower Rogue levels in this version, but purely because of 3 aims that I had, which were to get EDR III, Dev Crit and Epic Weapon Spec. The latter two were also desired as early as possible in the life of the build. Dev Crit is not usually to my tastes but its been about 2 years since I last used the feat in a build so I thought what the heck and went for it.<br><br>Anyway for your critique ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the Bloodyminded Bugger...<br><br><b>Abilities:</b><br>STR: 16 (28)<br>DEX: 12<br>CON: 18 (22)<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 6<br><br>01: Rogue(1): Blooded<br>02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Greataxe<br>03: Fighter(2): Blind Fight, Power Attack<br>04: Fighter(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>05: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Greataxe<br>06: Rogue(2): Cleave, {Evasion}<br>07: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>08: Rogue(4): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>09: Fighter(5): Knockdown<br>10: Champion of Torm(1)<br>11: Champion of Torm(2): Improved Critical: Greataxe<br>12: Rogue(5): STR+1, Improved Knockdown, (STR=19)<br>13: Rogue(6)<br>14: Rogue(7)<br>15: Rogue(8): Improved Initiative<br>16: Rogue(9): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>17: Rogue(10): Improved Evasion<br>18: Champion of Torm(3): Great Cleave, {Smite Evil}<br>19: Rogue(11)<br>20: Rogue(12): STR+1, (STR=21)<br>21: Champion of Torm(4): Great Strength I, Epic Weapon Focus: Greataxe, (STR=22)<br>22: Champion of Torm(5)<br>23: Champion of Torm(6): Epic Weapon Specialization: Greataxe<br>24: Fighter(6): STR+1, Great Strength II, Overwhelming Critical: Greataxe, (STR=24)<br>25: Champion of Torm(7)<br>26: Champion of Torm(8): Epic Prowess<br>27: Champion of Torm(9): Great Strength III, (STR=25)<br>28: Champion of Torm(10): CON+1, Devastating Critical: Greataxe, (CON=19)<br>29: Rogue(13): Crippling Strike<br>30: Rogue(14): Great Constitution I, (CON=20)<br>31: Fighter(7)<br>32: Fighter(8): CON+1, Epic Damage Reduction I, (CON=21)<br>33: Fighter(9): Epic Will<br>34: Fighter(10): Epic Damage Reduction II<br>35: Fighter(11)<br>36: Fighter(12): STR+1, Great Strength IV, Epic Damage Reduction III, (STR=27)<br>37: Rogue(15)<br>38: Fighter(13)<br>39: Fighter(14): Great Strength V, Armor Skin, (STR=28)<br>40: Rogue(16): CON+1, Superior Initiative, (CON=22)<br><br><b>Other:</b><br>Hitpoints: 576<br>Skillpoints: 286<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 32/24/28<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +6, Traps: +3, Poison: +2<br>BAB: 27<br>AB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 29 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/ no shield only): 21/29<br><br><b>Skills:</b><br>Craft Armor 3(5)<br>Craft Weapon 3(5)<br>Disable Trap 26(30)<br>Discipline 42(51)<br>Open Lock 29(30)<br>Search 23(25)<br>Set Trap 5(8)<br>Spellcraft 18(20)<br>Spot 43(44)<br>Tumble 40(41)<br>UMD 42(40)<br><br>Obviously this creation has no shield, so AC may be an issue for some.

not much to say.  i mean, you obviously went dev crit, which i would never do, but beyond that its a solid build.  its a proven fact that fighter, rogue, cot is strong, especially when combined with a dwarf.  well done.<br><br>-cs<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By christian.schnabel on 09/05/06 00:49</span></i></p>

I wouldn't worry about the name, it's no worse than my Self-Righteous Bastard.  The build does look good and it looks pretty versatile and playable in most situations.  There are a few suggestions I would make.  <br><br>If this is devastating critical build I'm guessing your opponents will have it too.  Since the lowest level 40 DC is 37 for devastating critical, you might want to increase your fortitude save a bit.  If you drop blooded and superior initiative, you could take great fortitutde and epic fortitude which would give you a 38 fortitude save.  With save boosts from equipment, that should put you into fail on 1 territory against most devastating critical attacks, and since your AC isn't great you might have to save against a few of them.  <br><br>Also, you might want to consider a weapon with a bigger threat range like a greatsword (but dwarves look really bad with them) or a heavy flail.<br><br>I might be a little concerned about your AB, since you don't have any buffs or taunt to raise it and a base 40 isn't great, but should do the job against most opponents.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Good points there... yeah AB was a concern as to how it could get higher, likewise the Fort Save.<br><br>Foregoing DevCrit or EDR would give you options... likewise taking more Fighter or CoT pre-epic would do also.<br><br>Undecided currently, I will think some more on this one.
