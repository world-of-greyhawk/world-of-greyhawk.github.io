<b>Playable from level 1 - 40</b><br><br>This is a build that is meant to be good at any level in any world/mod/server. This is NOT THE STRONGEST of all but a very flexible build with many spells, skills and a nice kick in combat. Can be used as a team buffer, can open locks, disarm traps, can be used as heavy artillery, can summon a wall of summons, can be a barter-persuader, a moving medical corps, or anything you can think of… and he will be good at it.    <br><br>Pros:<br>+Easy to play on early levels (1-18) (animal domain – can summon creatures that, when buffed, are stronger than most PC on the same level)<br>+Has almost every skill (except animal empathy and perform) as a class skill at some point<br>+High saves starting from level 10 (40to50 when buffed on level 40 plus a +5 bonus vs. spells from spellcraft skill)<br>+14D6 sneak attack <br>+crippling strike<br>+Evasion (can get improved evasion at the cost of 1d6 sneak attack )<br>+up to 23 unavoidable damage with every hit (divine might, divine favor, battletide)  <br>+great buffing and protecting spells (bulls strength, bless, prayer, aid, greater magical weapon, darkfire, death ward, protection from elements, spell resistance (27), protection from alignments, protection from negative energy, improved invisibility… and so on…)<br>+can enhance weapons/armor/himself on low-magic servers, can use any item on high magic servers (UMD)  <br>+enough skill points (a total of 267 on level 40)<br>+4 base attacks (5 with rapid shot, 6 with haste)<br>+decent AC with heavy armor and +8 doge ac form tumble<br>+no XP penalty<br>+no alignment shifts<br>+great in PvM<br><br>Cons:<br>-Dramatically low HP (a max of 251, with buffs and CON boosting items can obtain a max of 514 also getting toughens instead of impr.crit will give extra 40hp,if you don’t care for RP and skill points that much then you can also have 10CON and 8INT, but have in mind that this character won’t fight in the first row and with 50% concealment from improved invisibility and a decent armor won’t be hit very often)<br>-Low AB, without buffs/items his AB is only 30/25/20/15 with a regular bow<br>-Easy to dispel – with only 15 levels of cleric his spells can be easily dispelled, leaving him almost defenseless (but you have invisibility, improved invisibility and greater sanctuary to make that dramatic exit) <br>-Low AC. With typical items in the 40tish, with epic items in the 70ties – that’s low compared to some builds with ac over 100<br>-lacks discipline – can have a max of 23, and since his AC will almost always be over 43 then he has no chance of making the skill check once he is hit (this can be easily repaired by taking a level of black gourd in the late epic at the cost of extra sneak attack damage)<br>-Can’t get immunity to mind affecting spells from neutral alignments via spells (though a will save of 34 to 50 should be enough, and you can get flexible mind, allowing you to re-roll at the cost of +1d6 sneak attack)  <br>-Sucks at PvP <br><br>Still interested?

So what do you think? Can it be improved? Any feedback welcome (though it probably be only criticism).<br><br><br>Corrected ..typo in build title <br>+ added missing starting stat "INT 10" <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 03/26/05 17:46</span></i></p>

Suggestion: Start as Rogue, not Cleric to get more Skill points at the character creation. <br><br>Questions: <br>What is your Intelligence? You forgot to post that.<br><br>Why so many points in Charisma? I don't see any use for them other than 1. Bonus to saves due to Blackguard, or 2. Extended Cleric Domain abilities.<br><br>Wouldn't those points be better used in Wisdom or Dexterity? Or Strength or Constitution even? If you put them in Dex and took Weapon Finesse or put them in Wisdom they'd help your BAB. Sorry if I don't get it, but...I don't get why there is so much Charisma. I don't see any Charisma feats that I recognize (Divine Shield/Might, etc). I don't play Charisma-based so I could just be ignorant.<br><br>Nice thing about Cleric and Blackguard is that you can cast two Bull's Strength spells on yourself.<br><br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br>Check out the Epic Character Builders Guild<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Test your new builds in this mod:<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/modules/data/1073117317280.shtml" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

INT is 10. You start of with 10 and end up with 10… I’ve misted that somehow, sorry.<br><br>I’ve decided to start as a Cleric because it’s much easier to advance to level 2 this way (your AC, AB, HP, damage is just to low) as a cleric with animal domain you can summon a boar at level one (his stats: AC16, HP33, AB +8, 1d8+3, your stats as a rogue: AC11, HP5, AB+1, +1d6 sneak attack)<br><br>I’ve boosted charisma so high to get the most of divine might (look again, I’ve taken it at level 1) that is +16 divine, unavoidable damage for 16 rounds, usable 20 times per day (if you can get +7carisma items, you get +2-5cha from spells) and to give a +16 bonus to all saving throws (my goal was to have a minimum of 45 so that you never fail a throw against enemy spells  unless by throwing ”1” – AFAIK the max DC of a 9lev. spell is 45). You could also take divine shield somewhere but I don’t recommend that, you have from 2 up to 4 spells to cast in the beginning of combat adding a 5th spell on top of that is not a good idea and you probably won’t get +16 AC from that – it’s doge AC caped at a total of 20, you get 8 from tumble 4 from hast, with a bit of luck something like boots of hardness +1-8 so divine shield will give you only 1 to 7 point of AC….or am I wrong??
