Right! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>This time i was thinking about a level 30 Cleric with Zen Archery and Divine Might..<br><br>Since it is a cleric it shouldnt really matter what kind of magic world he is in, because he will enchant him self, and stuff..<br><br>Maybe throwing in few Paladin levels for 4 attacks, fear immunity and the savingthrows might be a good idea?<br><br>So! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>If any of you have an idea or two, i would be happy to hear.. Or read.. Whatever.. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

You were thinking?  What were you thinking?  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Dude, as far as I can see, this is your 3rd OPEN request for a build with no real build outline for what you are really looking for.  From what I can see you wanted a monk, then rdd, now cleric?  All of these classes play very differently.  Before we can tweek something or offer insight, we need a build outline, at least.  Otherwise its meaningless drival!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif"> <br><br>*insert YOUR build here*

Well, yeah, I'd agree with avado, you just post requests like crazy with no aparent meaning....<br><br>But now then, I've come close to doing that, so I won't bother too much about that.<br><br>Well, in fact, Clerics are better to buff melee weapons, since Greater Magical Weapon and Darkfire are melee only, but you could very well make a Cleric with a lot of WIS and Zen Archery, I'd suggest a monk level for WIS AC, and then maybe Shadowdancer, Rogue or Dwarven Defender to cover your DEX, as you won't be using heavy armor Uncanny Dodge or Defensive Awareness should help.<br><br>As always, it's how you like it how you should make it, I would make a Cleric 15 / Bard 2 / Arcane Archer 13, Bard for skilldumps and you get good healing and buffs with 15 Cleric, as well as max power from Divine Favor, Trickery Domain gives you a very good Improved Invisibility, and 13 Arcane Archer gives Enchant Arrow VII (plus, I like Imbue Arrow). I won't make the build for you though..... use the searcher, I could bet there are at least 5 Cleric/Arcane Archer.
