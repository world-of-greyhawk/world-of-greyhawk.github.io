First Post <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I'm hoping someone can help me out with a (Prefferably Human) Blackguard(10+)/Cleric/? build. My main focus is on it being as much of a meele powerhouse as possible utilising cleric buffs, although i'd also like it to be able to cast harm and/or word of faith if it could be worked in there for extra nastiness. The whole theme of the build is a Blackguard to truly be reckoned with.<br><br>In the search engine i found the infernal crusader, by Xylophone, which is a Clr14/Barb4/BG22 and is very similar to what i'd like to play, but the level progression isn't ideal for the pw i'm at. Its a difficult pw with slow leveling and is very low magic, the best items you can expect to see are +1 or +2 if your damn lucky. <br>So the real problem i stumbled over is milking the most out of the pre epic levels to suit this environment. With the world being so low magic, having a large array of personal magic and quickly is a huge advantage.<br><br>If anyones got any ideas or your good at squeezing the most out of each level you take (which is what i really need to do but am unfortunatly, not good enough to manage) i'd appreciate any help a lot. <br><br>Thanks for reading <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Well... for a low magical environment Cleric is a good choice, Greater Magical Weapon and Darkfire already own everything there.<br><br>Well, the playability here depends mostly on taking Cleric fast, I'd say up to level 15 to maximize Greater Magical Weapon at least. I usually take 20 Cleric to maximize Darkfire and get a decent duration for Divine Power.<br><br>I'd make a Monk 1 / Cleric 20 / Blackguard 19 with kamas, take Monk from the very start and start leveling Cleric, you'll find it very powerful on low levels since you have Flurry of Blows making 2 APR of buffed attacks right from the start (or 3 if you go dual-wielding), the good thing of Monk is you'll get the bonus to APR with just one level so you won't need to lower your Blackguard levels for a third class, Monk also gives you Cleave for free so you won't need to waste feats on Power Attack.<br><br>Another working build is to go Fighter for Epic Weapon Specialization, Fighter 4 / Cleric 20 / Blackguard 16 is what I'd make.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/09/08 18:37</span></i></p>

I have been having a great time with a bard30/rdd5/blk5. With the right gear you can reach that 100 modified perform skill and are then able to do some horrifying things with combinations of curse song, divine might, divine shield and devcrit. Charisma based skills like taunt, bluff and persuasion also shine here.

Finn is prolly right. The diff between level 25 bardsong with 75 ranks and level 30 with 100 pans out to 10 more hitpoints, a point of ac and 5 bonus skillpoints. The other tradeoff between the builds gives heavy bard 2 more epic feats instead of fire immunity, a few draconic ac points and 4 more points of strength as well as some nice immunities. For me, I guess I just really can't stand the wings.

Thanks again to everyone that replied, just so you know, i was sheerly curious about Deltu's build and not intending to make it as an "iconic BG", anything with less than 10 levels of the icon class (1/4 of the build), is an icon only of mediocrity at best.<br><br>"The wind blew chill over the cemetary in the pale moonlight as hunched figures lay prone in a small bank of tall grass, shivering.<br><br>In hushed tones, one figure whispered to another,<br>"Captain, is this really nessecary?"<br>To which came the sharp yet quiet reply,<br>"Shut it Richards! He'll be here any minute."<br>Richards lowered his head, weighing up his options. As the wind continuted to bite at him, he decided to risk the insubordination<br>"But its only one man Captain!" He said a bit too loudly, earning a swift clip on the back of the head with a mailed fist.<br>"Quiet you fool!" Came Reynolds, the guardsman lying next to Richards, annoyed response. "This isn't any man, this is a master of the Pale, capable of summoning undead abominations the like of which a mans eyes should never have to lay on, or have you forgotten why we brought four priests from the templ..."<br>He cut off abruptly as a dark clad figure emerged from the main necropolis, tilting his robed head in their direction almost immediatly, no doubt having heard or spotted them.<br><br>"Attack Men! The priests have our back!" Shouted the Captain, drawing forth his sword and rising into a charge almost immediatly.<br>The palemaster was well ahead of him, however, and had already launched into a summoning, drawing upon his font of dark power to bring forth...<br>A single, badly decomposed zombie clawed its way up from the ground, its left leg snapping clean off at the knee as it attempted to pull free of the earth. It fell flat on its face and moaned pitifully.<br><br>Incredulous laughter burst out from all in attendance, except the "Palemaster" who suddenly pulled forth a lute, strumming a quick tune, which earned an even louder roar of laugher. He then drew forth a longsword and shield, charging toward the laughing guardsmens position even as he enacted spells to increase his prowess. Only a single priest survived, because he had fled the slaughter. <br><br>Tales spread quickly through the local taverns of the town, not of a powerful undead wizard, capable of summoning the darkest of minions from the abyss, but of "Lutesword" the Dark Minstrel.<br><br><br>Oh and Hiwatt, do you have or know of some build notes for;<br><br>Cleric 26 Bg 4 Monk 10<br>Monk 14 Bg 25 Sor 1 (or 11 28 1)<br><br>Curious again <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By MS06-Zaku on 03/11/08 22:13</span></i></p>

Serious PvPers don't often post their best builds.<br><br>But, my comment wasn't meant to be insulting to you, just that almost 6 years of playing NWN exclusively on PvP servers has shown me that the 26 4 10 Bard Bg Rdd is really, really overused.  I've built about 7 of them myself over the years, and almost never use any of the anymore, although my favorite version is a dex based halfling with a whip.  Surprisingly effective.<br><br>Usually, when I see someone using that Bard Bg Rdd build, I just log a pally/hipser or a smiter and wreck it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Don't get me wrong, it's a solid build if done right, and can stand toe to toe with most anything out there, but just like anything that gets used too much (and there are plenty of builds that fit that description), it gets boring when that's all you see, or all you PvP against.  After playing the game this long, I tend to prefer less conventional, or more imaginative builds, that's all.<br><br>If the build is new to you, and you like it, then by all means, build it, play it, and enjoy it.  That's what it's all about, right?

Thanks again Kail. There was actually nothing I found backhanded in your reply. But what I noticed is that when you search for unspecified levels of bard/bg/rdd you get the 12 builds I listed, but none of the three you did. As soon as I revised the search for a minimum 26 levels of bard, thats when your results turned up. I just think, with all due respect to it's creator, that there may be a slight issue with the search engine.<br><br>For the other poster- Power and grace can be demonstrated more easily by giving freely what you have and know. Serious PVP takes place when all parties have the same resources to command. The master guides, not bullies.
