I saw this build in a magazine... now is it me or is it impossible to do this build?

You can start with those exact stats and be human. I would recommend that for the extra feat at first level. But still you are 1 pre-epic feat short, and even then you lack the Exotic as you noted. I would presume he is mistaken, as the build would probably need fighter 10/Barb2. The barbarian probably taken for Taunt.

To get the pre-epic feats right I had to go with human and more Fighter levels. That said, i would really go Dwarf for +40 hp, and dump that initiative feat. I would also switch Barbarian for Bard to gain +4 tumble AC, and +5 spellcraft save bonus, still keep Taunt and discipline maxed and perhaps room for UMD, but here we go.<br><br>Human, non-Lawful<br><br>STR 16(32)<br>DEX 14<br>CON 14<br>WIS 10<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8<br><br>1-9 fighter<br>10 Barb<br>11-23 WM<br>24 Fighter<br>25-39 WM<br>40 Barb<br><br>1: Wep prf: Exotic; WF: Scythe; Dodge<br>2: Mobility<br>3: Expertise<br>4: WS<br>6: Sp-attack; WWA<br>8: IC: Scythe<br>9: PA<br>12: Cleave<br>15: Gr.Cleave<br>18: Imp.Init<br>21: G.STR<br>23: EWF<br>24: EWS; G.STR<br>27: G.STR; Over-Crit<br>30: G.STR; Dev Crit<br>33: G.STR; Armor Skin<br>36: G.STR; Ep-Prow<br>39: Sup.init and either KDown or Toughness<br><br>Take intimidate 4 at Barb levels, Max discipline, Tumble x-classed at 20 points, Taunt maxed at barb levels, spellcraft x-classed to 18 and still 53 skillpoints to go.<br><br>AB=52 with normal scythe, AC=25 normal full plate.<br>Dmg=2d4+22. saves are 23/22/16.<br><br>I would do<br><br>Dwarf<br>STR 17(34)<br>DEX 13<br>CON 16<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 6<br><br>Drop both initiative feats, trade Barb for Bard.<br>At lvl 39 take G.STR 7 and Toughness.<br><br>Pros over Human Barb version: +40 hp, +4 AC, +5 saves vs spells, Dwarven bonus to saves and poison, Dwarf and finally a little bit UMD.<br><br>Cons: -43 skillpoints, the pre-epic bard level will change your save somewhat, not sure what is different from Barb.<br><br>You are free to take your choice.<br><br>Good luck.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Excellent <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>For a moment I thought there was something I was missing. Nice to know I'm still slightly sane... Will try your build out instead. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
