Just wondering, which build(s) do you all think would be the best to start as a new char and level up exclusively PvM?<br><br>Any suggestions would be nice <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Give us some specs.   <br><br>  The world your in is Very important.  Low magic, high magic. Rules, changes. Party, solo. etc etc. for example, in a world where +15 stuff is the high end, a straight,unarmed monk may be gimped. Are there many immunity items available?   How about regen items?<br><br>  Umd is greatly effected on availability of magic scrolls and items.<br><br> Is this for HoTU type and level encounters, or are we talking high epic, 1000's of hp encounters?  For normal HoTU encounters, a high damage mid ac/defense  character is probably fine.  For a very high epic server, you may need much more ac/dam. reduction/immunity to provide some staying power.<br><br>Also, do you want even power/leveling, or do you want to max power near the end.<br><br>Well, I am sure there are many more questions that could be asked before suggestions on very effective PvE builds can be discussed.<br><br>note:I like this question, and would ask it myself, as I am looking for the most effective/survivable build as well.

Well I'm not playing in a single PW.<br><br>My plan is to start a level 1 or 2 char and level him up in multiplayer mods with some friends, so each mod will be different but we will be using the highest rated mods we can find on NWVault for our level/no. of players.<br><br>To narrow it down further, I'm not too interested in 'sneaky' chars. Also I am playing a Shifter in my current single player game and have played Monk, Cleric and Wizard quite a bit in the past and probably want to avoid those too (not necessarily though). In the end I think my ideal char would be one of:<br><br>A noble Paladin type char or other powerful melee weapon combatant (although not *too* heavily focused on Charisma feats)<br>An archer/bard<br>A really versatile, powerful spellcaster.<br><br>One build that interestes me is Chndragons Cleric/Sorc/RDD, can't really think of good examples of the other two types there.
