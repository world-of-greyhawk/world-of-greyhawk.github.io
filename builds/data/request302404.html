Is it possible to build a dual weilding (shortswords) paladin / bard / assassin?<br><br>I have tried building it several times but as I originally envisaged using kukris I seemed to end up using lots of pre-epic feats in epic levels... For example, I had the Power Attack/Divine Sheild/Cleave feat tree in spite of starting the character with a Strength of 10, all the dual wielding feats and improved critical for kukri and blooded/improved initiative. I remember trying to shoehorn Extra Music in as well before I gave up!<br><br>Yes, I appreciate that alignment contortions are impossible to do without using a leveler.<br>Also it didn't help that I was kind of unfocused with what I wanted to achieve with this character -- I tried to shoot for as much bardic magic as I could grab as well as the full 4 levels of paladin spells.... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br><br>I was just wondering how someone else would put this character together *PROPERLY*. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>So, to sum up I'm looking for a dual shortsword weilding assassin with levels in paladin and bard with as much magic as can be mustered.<br><br>~ Rich

The proper way would be to dump Bard and grab Fighter. 4 Fighter levels grant you 3 feats, that should be handy. The other proper way is to drop dual-wielding, which is also a relatively good idea, that also allows you to drop DEX in favor of CHA and STR. It is to be noted that a Paladin has the hardest status distribution of all classes, since there's no single worthless stat on a Paladin, I normally drop DEX and/or INT.<br><br>Also, what the hell? Blooded and Improved Initiative? those feats are only to be taken by Fighter/CoT builds which are looking for something to waste feats on, not on a heavily feat-starved dual-wielding divine-feats Paladin.<br><br>As for the initial question <!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Is it possible to build a dual weilding (shortswords) paladin / bard / assassin?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --> I advice not to do it, but possible it is. In order to reach it you should take pre-epic: Power Attack, Blind-Fight, Weapon Focus, Ambidexterity, TWF, ITWF, Divine Shield (looks that's the divine feat you want, but I'd take Divine Might) and Improved Critical (Humans get 8 feats pre-epic). On epics you take Epic Weapon Focus, Epic Prowess and Great Strength feats. You could take Cleave on epics, but for a dual-wielder, Cleave isn't as important, your choice. <br><br>As for the stats, here's a suggestion:<br>STR 14<br>DEX 14<br>CON 14<br>INT 8<br>WIS 14<br>CHA 14<br><br>You're a Paladin, so don't worry about skills, use the Bard to take Tumble and UMD, Discipline is nice too, you could lower CON for INT a bit, I haven't counted if you can grab Disciplie with 8 INT on a Human, sorry, but I'm not a skills expert, do magic to qualify for Assassin.<br><br>On stat increases, you obviously increase DEX to 15 to take Ambidexterity, and then increase STR all the way, maybe some CHA as you see fit.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 10/21/08 01:15</span></i></p>

I don't have time (lunch break) to go into details but I ran thru SoU-One of the bridges(cant remember which one)-HoTu with a pally-ranger-assassin that worked better than I thought it would have.<br><br><br><br><br><br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"><br>_________________<br>In the name of justice, I spite all misdeeds.
