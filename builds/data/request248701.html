There's a recent build on the server that I play on that has popped up and it is seriously annoying me, since I play a sneaker thats impossible to see from anything that doesnt have true seeing. The only thing that can see its shifters with natural TS in a form, since TS is otherwise nerfed on the server to just give a spot/listen bonus.<br><br>Anyway, the build I want to hunt down and kill is a Druid/Palemaster/Shadow Dancer, I'm pretty sure. Its possible it may be a monk though and is only gaining Hide in Plain Sight by an armour that possesses the HiPS feat.<br><br>The server is slightly high magic but there are no real items that possess ridiculous damage resistances, immunities or invulnerabilities. Most of the best armour comes with a +12 AC bonus and other goodies, and the weapons are quite good although not /great/.<br><br>So, can somebody provide me with a build to slay this evil creature? Its causing great havoc for players everywhere. I have one that can kill it, my Rakshasha ice shifter, but most of the time it can get away or have its friends kill me whilst I kill it. I need something to shut it down and shut it down quickly. <br><br>Thanks.

A high level Cleric/Bard can Implode him for the win.

Like I said I'm not 100% sure on the details but he's definitely immune to sneaks and criticals, so he's definitely a palemaster at least. And he has to be a druid, otherwise how else could he get Dragon Shape? I havent observed him to shift into any other forms so he is definitely just a druid. And he can definitely Hide in Plain Sight, though that /may/ be possible from the armour I mentioned earlier.

Dragons by themselves are immune to sneak attacks no need for PM. Are you sure it's also crit immune? Or maybe critical immunity can be from armor? Not having Monk in a dragon build is odd and having PM means no Monk.<br><br>Implosion might not work all that good since the fortitude save will probably be high.  Time stop, Mord and IGMS spam should do the trick, try the Exalted Sorceress. You can also try Harm with a cleric (you'll be ignoring all WIS and lvl based monk AC, AS, PM AC if really the build has got PM) or build yourself a Dragon (go with Cleric/Druid/Monk for example) and pound it in melee. If the dragon's evil go with a great smiter, one critical smite is all you need (if it's not really crit immune of course) or a dev critter (again, unless it's really crit immune and not just sneak immune).<br><br>The environment you describe is high magic, dragon builds shouldn't shine there. More info about both the build you are facing and your PW is necessary for better advice.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?

I've seen Critical Immune Helmets on lower magical environments than +12, helm merges with dragon shape so it's perfect, that way I doubt he's a Pale Master at all, he might be a Druid/Monk/Shadowdancer, that makes more sense in my mind as for power.<br><br>Dragon shift spell is much weaker than the dragon shift feat, although the spell is still a good shift. If I'm correct, if it's the spell you can Dispel its shift, I've had my Elemental shifts dispelled on some PvP servers and I end like a sitting duck (I have no idea which spell they used BTW, maybe Mords), so why not try that to check? Although I've recieved Mords when in dragon shape and it didn't faded <br><br>Kail's ideas are good, an Exalted Sorcerer or Cleric using Harm should work ok, you can also try my build: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "238107", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Arcane Wall V2</a> I've never had troubles killing dragons whith it, the DR is high, so a dragon can't make more than 20 damage or so, against 700 base HP... they just kill themselves against the protections (there's an acid for the red ones and a fire for the green ones) and meanwhile I spam IGMS with my superb Concentration checks.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 08/03/06 15:49</span></i></p>

Apparently the Dragon isnt immune to criticals afterall, I watched somebody dev crit him last night. I forgot all about the immunity to sneak attacks being natural to the build. A dev critter might be the way to go here, but I'll need one that can actually spot the damned thing. The server isnt that high magic that it has immunity to anything other than "Freedom" or a few spell immunities e.g Immunity to IGMS shield, Immunity to Bigbys shield with major divine and acid vulnerabilities as a trade off, etc, so he could have a critical immunity item. <br><br>I suppose a cleric with a high listen might be the way to go? They can get hide up to 117ish (I've succeeded anyway with my hider and all the best gear, which includes a +40 bonus to hide max and a +30 bonus to move silently), so I'd need a listen skill to top that. There is a +20 (I think, it may be +25, not 100% sure) spot/listen helmet, and true seeing gives a spot/listen bonus, though I'm not sure how big a bonus it is. Err, a cleric/rdd/bard with spot as well as amplify to augment everything? I dont know, somebody help me out here for I am stumped xD

What about your standard Bard/FTR/RDD with lots of Bard levels (for good Bard Song boosts to skills), ESF:Spot or Listen, and Dev Crit?<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Well, you can't say we haven't tried to help with build suggestions...<br><br>Don't take this wrong, but Dev Crit is not regularly the best thing to kill dragons, a dragon should have around 30 Fort save and around 80 AC, anyway, I'd make a Fighter/Weapon Master/Barbarian, your AB will be high, you'll crit more often with a WM and the Rage will improve your DC and AB a little bit more. If you can cap your STR with items forget about the Barbarian.<br><br>You could try a Ranger with BoE, simple thing of taking Dragon as your Favored Enemy and you'll get nasty damage bonus against it.
