<b>This build is PvM (i dont do pvp) and it is playable from lv 1 to 40,</b> in the order of feats/classes taken.<br><br>Ok.  I have posted on others' builds of this ilk and i decided, after much fussing, to post my version.  In other builds, the builder decided to stop wm at 7..  i did a version of this and it came up with final ab of 39/34/29/24 vs what this build does, so the 19 wm lvls is important!<br><br>Spoiler:  this is a dev crit build.  It is designed to be a tank, plain and simple.  That said, you are a decent cleric (15lvls) so you do have some spells at your disposal.  Again, they should be used as a last resort and not the main reason you exist (UNLESS you can find some +wisdom items and can get wisdom to 30 or so, but thats another build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     )<br><br>Dwarf, Lawful neutral<br>(the miserableness comes from charisma of 6, not alignment)<br>st 16  In 13 De 13  Co 10  Ch 6  Wis 16<br><br>01 cleric1     dodge  [healing/earth]   int 2<br>02 cleric2<br>03 cleric3     wpn prof: exotic         int 3<br>04 cleric4                         w 17<br>05 cleric5                              int 4<br>06 cleric6     wfoc: dwarfaxe<br>07 cleric7<br>08 cleric8                         s 17<br>09 cleric9     mobility <br>10 cleric10<br>11 fighter1    expertise<br>12 fighter2    spring att/whirlwind s18<br>13 fighter3  <br>14 fighter4    wpn spec:dwarf axe<br>15 cleric11    improve crit: dwarf axe<br>16 cleric12                         s19<br>17 cleric13<br>18 cleric14    extend spell<br>19 cleric15<br>20 wpnmastr1                        w18<br>21 wpnmstr2      epic wf:dwrfaxe<br>22 wpnmstr3<br>23 wpnmstr4<br>24 wpnmstr5      power attack         s20<br>25 wpnmstr6<br>26 wpnmstr7<br>27 fighter5    epic wpnspec:dwarf axe<br>28 wpnmstr8                           s21<br>29 wpnmstr9<br>30 wpnmstr10     cleave<br>31 wpnmstr11 <br>32 wpnmstr12                          s22<br>33 wpnmstr13     great cleave/epic prowess<br>34 wpnmstr14<br>35 wpnmstr15<br>36 wpnmstr16     overwhelm crit/great str I s24<br>37 wpnmstr17<br>38 wpnmstr18<br>39 fighter6      great st 2/armor skin  s25<br>40 wpnmstr19     devastatin crit      s26<br><br>i took  conc 35/ dis 43/spot43.. but you can take what you will.. + 4 (8 cross) to intimidate for wpnmstr.<br><br>ac 13<br>fort 23/ ref 19/ will 24<br>ab unarmd 35/30/25/20<br>dwarf axe 42/37/32/27   d10 +14 (17-20*4)<br><br>How do I play this build?<br>I love clerics.  I find them easy to lvl initially, so i took the first 10 lvs as cleric (esp with str of 16 to start.. makes combat easy).  Get used to using the cleric buffs in combat..  divine favor is a must.  infact once i get up to lv15 cleric i have only div favs in the slots for lv 1 and 2 (ext) slots.. with 15 cleric lvls you get +5 per hit!  Remember, damage is the thing here.   (i would love to make a divine might version, but the stats are too thin to make it worth the effort.  If you try this, go human (no cha penalty), and pump charisma instead of str.  The difficulty will be not havin the double charisma buff that other classes get, and not bein a pally, the high charisma is wasted.)<br><br>Use extended Bulls, darkfire, endurance, shield of faith, great magic wpn, true sight, etc (all extended). the only thing that hurts this build is the 15 cleric lvls, but extended spell makes up for this.<br><br>If you are in a party, keep some gr restores and reses ready, in case.  And if you need (have room), some of the nicer damage spells could be memd..  could be  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>Ok, so what?  what makes mine so different?  Nothing really.  Its just a very solid version that i have played through many times.  The fun thing, if you are into rp, is the 6 charisma!  you can be a miserable son of a gun as you bash the heck out of the competition! <br><br>Oh, i almost forgot!  Why dwarf axe?  with buffs, i have critted for over 150, with one hand.  I know its nothing versus the pure str builds.. but you aint a str builder! you a cleric.  Those dudes arnt half the man you are, even though you are half their height!  <br><br>Peace<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 05/15/05 14:07</span></i></p>

Fine build and i thrust that you know what you have been doing. You could make him more reliable by taking the cleric lvls after lvl 20. that would net you some BaB, but you will lose some of the great will saves cleric adds.

Because of my love of the divine, i never considered that option: taking weapon master before lv 20, for this build.  I ran the change (taking 10cl/4ftr/6wm) and i increased the bab by 1.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>THe reason i took cleric though was to get your +5 to armor and weapon (if you didnt have access to +5 or greater on your pw or mod), before lv 20.  I love having access to those skills as soon as possible.  In fact, I hated taking the fighter lvls when i did because it postponed the cleric lvls, but i felt that the feats that fighter gives (the whirlwind in particular) was worth the trade at that lvl.  Otherwise, i may have went cleric15/ftr4/wm1.   In the end its all the same.  <br><br>Thanks for the suggestion.<br><br>Peace
