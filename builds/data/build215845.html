Its not much but they will make lvling a little easier and its always nice to have a str buff.  If you don’t feel the spells are worth it, you could easily pump his con (his health is his biggest weakness) instead of Cha, or go with 17 str and 13 dex for dodge (replace imp init) and Epic Reflexes (replace great str 4).  Even so, this guy has great AC (for an armor wearer) with epic warding to boot, good melee damage, bard song/curse song/taunt for those hard to reach places, and a hellball for good measure.<br>That's all folks.  Questions? Answers? Improvements?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 10/11/05 23:57</span></i></p>

it merely serves to lower an opponents Attack, Damage, Will and Fort rolls by 1 point for a duration of 10 rounds.

admittedly, one could take it or leave it, as the stats on a 4th lvl curse song are really negligable, but 1 AB-AC can make a difference when its close, especially when combined with his bard song and taunt.  I had the feat to kill from taking so much fighter pre-epic (I wanted to maximize AB), and theres nothing worse for a melee than not being able to hit your target...
