Good no longer needs to wait for Evil to come within arms reach.  Retribution to the unjust can now be delivered on sight, in sufficient damage and quantity to make it seem like like the heavens have opened up and is raining divine thunderbolts.  <br><br>Yes, this build has no PRC classes in it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   It does have PRC FEATS in it though, and has been optimized to use them to full effectiveness.  As you will see, that takes it to an entirely new level of damage. . .even with no dispellable buffing required.  The major feats to watch (and affect the build) are:<br><br>Holy Martial Strike<br>Prerequisite: Smite Evil, Good Alignment, Epic character.<br>Any weapon used is treated as a holy weapon (+2d6 holy damage). <br><br>Epic Divine Might<br>Prerequisite: Divine Might, Turn Undead, Cha 21+, Str 21+, Power Attack.<br>The character may spend one of his turn undead attempts to add twice his Charisma bonus to all weapon damage for a number of rounds equal to twice the Charisma bonus.<br><br>This guy is geared towards getting the most out of all forms of ranged damage possible; he is very damaging in normal circumstances, but he gets SERIOUS damage when you have Mighty bows, and Str+Charisma enhancement.  And almost half is Divine damage (very unlikely to be resisted).  Both versions of damage delivered are high enough to break most DRs.<br><br><br>Elf 9/2/29 Paladin/Sorc/AA<br><br>Str 16 (22)<br>Con 10<br>Dex 14 (18)<br>Wis 8<br>Int 10<br>Cha 16 (22)<br><br>Wears Plate Mail due to sub-optimium Dex.<br><br>1 Sorc - Point Blank Shot<br>2 Pal <br>3 Pal - WF(longbow)<br>4 Pal - Char(17)<br>5 Pal<br>6 Pal - Pow Attack<br>7 Pal <br>8 AA - Cha(18) <br>9 Pal - Divine Might<br>10 AA<br>11 AA<br>12 AA - Cha(19) Called Shot<br>13 AA<br>14 AA <br>15 AA - Imp Crit(longbow)<br>16 AA - Cha(20)<br>17 AA<br>18 Pal8 - Extra Turning (Discipline to 20)<br>19 Sorc2 - (Spellcraft to 20) <br>20 AA - Str(17)<br><br>8/2/10 Pal/Sorc/AA pre-epic; 4 attacks/round<br><br>21 AA - Holy Martial Strike (gains 2d6 vs evil on all weapons)<br>22 AA<br>23 AA<br>24 AA - Str(18) EWF(longbow), Rapid Shot<br>25 AA<br>26 AA<br>27 AA - GreatStr(19)<br>28 AA - Str(20),  GreatDex(15)<br>29 AA <br>30 AA - GreatStr(21)<br>31 AA<br>32 AA - Cha(21), GreatDex(16)<br>33 AA - GreatDex(17)<br>34 AA<br>35 AA<br>36 AA - Str(22), Many Shot, GreatDex(18)<br>37 AA<br>38 AA<br>39 Pal9 - Epic Divine Might (Cha bonus gives 2x to damage, duration)<br>40 AA - Cha(22)<br><br>Skills<br>------<br>Discipine 42<br>Listen 21<br>Spellcraft 20<br>Spot 21<br>Tumble 20<br><br>Saves - add +4 to these for Spellcraft against magic<br>-----<br>Fort 29<br>Reflex 29<br>Will 23<br><br>AB 51/46/41/36<br>As usual, True Strike is available too. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>Having a 29 BAB makes up somewhat for having a low Dex, but it cant cover the fact that most AA builds have around 30 Dex instead of 18.  Still, in comparision, whats a pure Fighter got to do to get 51AB?  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br><br>Bow Damage<br>----------<br><br>Bow damage (all normal, no mighty, no items, EpicDivineMight)<br>----------- --------------- ------------- ------------ -----<br>15 Turn Undeads at 12 rounds each.<br>So for 180 rounds a day, he can do, with EACH ARROW:<br><br>vs non-evil d8+15 + 12(Divine) = 31.5 Avg, 35 Max<br>vs Evil d8+15 + 12+2d6(Divine) = 38.5 Avg, 47 Max<br>The bow crit is 19-20x3 of that. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Bow damage with HotU items (+12 Cha, +8 Str, Mighty+10, unlimited arrows+5, EpicDivineMight)<br>----------- ------------- ------------- -------------- -----<br>21 Turn Undeads at 24 rounds each (affected by Cha bonus).<br>So for 504 (yes 504!) rounds a day, he can do, with EACH ARROW:<br><br>vs non-evil d8+15+10+5 + 24(Divine) = 58.5 Avg, 62 Max<br>vs Evil d8+15+10+5 + 24+2d6(Divine) = 65.5 Avg, 74 Max<br>The bow crit is 19-20x3 of that. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br><br>Pros: <br>The damage per arrow is simply awesome.<br>All Divine damage shown will work with melee weapons as well.<br><br><br>Cons:<br>Its embarassing to wear plate mail as an AA. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>For an AA build, the AB is 4-5 points lower than typical.<br>Really wants ability enhancement (items or party member buffing) to come into full effectiveness.<br>No access to Haste, but could if you gave up some AA levels (oddly enough, wont really affect overall damage much) <br>Could use something to help with Will saves.<br><br>Personally, I think I'm not sure I like the Many Shot feat, and as embarassing as it is to have 16 Dex for an AA, perhaps it would be better to drop 2 Great Dex feats, and take Epic Prowess and ArmorSkin. <br><br>Enjoy!

Excellent way to take a classic style build and give it a great PRC upgrade. Looks like a serious damage threat.

This build, while good, can IMO be improved.<br><br>Firstly, Pal12/Sorc1/AA27.

It's not really all that useful.<br><br>Fourth, pump that wis higher! You need it. Your AB lower than 3-4 AB from the standard AA builds; i'd say more like 5-8.<br><br>Also; you may look into doing Cleric 12 instead of Paladin 12. I think you can accomplish everything just as good.

Yea, Half-Elf would be better for this build probably.<br><br>Also, remember, while divine favor would only last 1 turn... you would have A LOT of uses for it.<br><br>I'd try to fit in extend spell, too, if I was you.<br><br>Also remember using WIS, if you find a item that raises paladin spell slots, and you get an item that gives fourth lvl slot, you can cast those fourth lvl spells (albeit only from the bonus slots).<br><br>For your AA bonus feats, I would select the following:<br><br>AA 14 - EWF: Longbow<br>AA 18 - Epic Prowess<br>AA 22 - Great Dexterity I (remember, you need a lil DEX for AC; plus there's not much else to take)<br>AA 26 - Great Dexterity II <br><br>Sure it'll slow down getting your AB a little bit, but not much else.<br><br>For starting stats:<br>14 str (??) how many grt strs you wanna take?<br>08 dex<br>10 con<br>16 wis (20)<br>10 int<br>16 cha (22)<br><br>Divine Favor gives +4 ab/+4 dmg using my template --- that's a whole lot more dmg <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Prayer is ALSO +1 dmg, so..<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Remember, if you're assuming mighty bow, you miaswell assume +12 str from items --- and sinc emighty bows above +8 are almost unheard of everywhere I play, 14+12 = 26 STR = +7 mighty; which is about as good as you're gonna get.<br><br>~ Lock.<br>_________________<br>"Life builds you up just to tear you down." - 3rd Strike

Okay, here is what a 12/1/27 version that uses Wisdom would have to do in order to make this work.<br><br>NOTE: I havent tested this yet so I might have a mistake in the build.  There is one BIG detail that would improve it a bit, but I dont have access to the game to check right now, and the grimoire says no.  More details below.

But I had to wait until epic to put them in, which is unfortunate. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   The order of the epic feats can easily be changed to get Called Shot and Rapid Shot earlier; I put them where they are mostly because its easy to talk about them and swap them out, from where I put them. . . <br><br>- I would have raised Wisdom on levels 33 and 36, but I do not beleive Called Shot and Rapid Shot are AA bonus feats (Grimoire says no).  If they were bonus feats, then I'd drop the 2 Great Dexes, put them there, and take 2 Great Wisdoms instead (or other feats). . . <br><br><br>Personally, its a nice variation of the build, and perhaps slightly better than the original in the end, but not earthshakingly so.  This build does get more of a synergy from Wisdom boosting, but it seems less "fun" than the original during leveling, due to delayed AA feats, etc.  Mostly its a tradeoff of:<br>- consistent non-dispellable damage and AB<br>versus<br>- lower consistent damage and AB, that 3-4 times a day can be made to be higher than the original (and can be dispelled)<br><br><br>I'll check on the AA bonus feats tonight. . .<br>_________________<br>Normal kids play rock-paper-scissors.<br>Shifter kids play IronGolem-RustMonster-MindFlayer. . .
