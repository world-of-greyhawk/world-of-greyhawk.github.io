<b>This is a playable character from level 1-40 PVM.</b><br><br>I created a character with the concept of being a team asset (Bard), and added some Taunting skills, with Called shot, so basically his role in a party is singing, then casting curse song, taunting, called shots, etc...  Basically a good character to have in any group.<br><br>He can solo using many of the bard spells.  I created him as a Strenght based character because I wanted him to be tough, and wanted better damage from his rapier.<br><br>Abilities:<br><br>STR:	15 (Main Ability, but kept it low to not cost too much at start)<br>DEX:	10<br>CON:	10<br>INT:	13<br>WIS:	8<br>CHA:	16 (All reqs for Bard level 6 spells).<br><br>GSTR refers to the Great Strenght Epic Feat, STR is the ability increase at each 4 levels.<br><br>1	RO1	PwrAtk,1d6 sneak<br>2	BD1<br>3	BD2	CurseSong		<br>4	BD3	STR 16	<br>5	BD4			<br>6	BD5	WF-Rapier		<br>7	BD6			<br>8	BD7	STR 17	<br>9	BD8	Cleave		<br>10	RO2		<br>11	RO3	2d6 sneak<br>12	FI1	IcritRapier,G.Cleave,STR 18	<br>13	FI2	CalledShot		<br>14	FI3			<br>15	FI4	Extend,WSpcRapier		<br>16	BD9	STR 19	<br>17	BD10			<br>18	BD11	Empower,Song:+2AC<br>19	BD12			<br>20	RO4	STR 20	<br>21	RO5	EWFRapier,3d6 sneak<br>22	BD13			<br>23	BD14	Song:+3AC<br>24	BD15	E.Skill Foc-Tumble,STR21,Song:+4AC<br>25	BD16	Song:+5AC<br>26	RO6			<br>27	FI5	EWpnSpec-Rapier		<br>28	RO7	STR22,4d6 sneak<br>29	BD17			<br>30	BD18	GSTR23		<br>31	BD19			<br>32	BD20	STR24	<br>33	BD21	LastingInspiration		<br>34	RO8			<br>35	RO9	5d6 sneak<br>36	RO10	O.Crit Rapier,I.Evasion,STR25	<br>37	RO11	6d6 sneak<br>38	FI6	Armor Skin		<br>39	RO12	Toughness		<br>40	RO13	CriplingStrike	STR26	7d6 sneak<br><br>HP MAX = 10*6 + 13*6 + 21 *6 = 264<br><br>If you're content with casting buffs in light robes, then putting on a full plate, this will do fine.

A couple things to consider:<br><br>1.  I believe you overspent start up points.  I believe a 15 Str requires 13 ability points, and your Charisma takes you up to 23.  You'll have to to drop two points somewhere, I think.  However, my math is usually wrong, so disregard if so.<br><br>2.  He is going to have a tough time surviving early on until he picks up that 1st fighter level.  With no Dex bonus, and no decent armor to wear, he's going to get clobbered, even with whatever buffs the Bard might provide.  I would suggest taking that fighter level at, say, Lvl 2.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

You can also get Lasting Inspiration at Bard lvl 20 if you time it with a normal feat level (21,24 etc).<br><br>Bard song AC also increases at level 25(to +6) and 30 (+7).  You mentioned that it was maxed out, but not quite.

I agree with that limitation Cin.  Lvl 16 is as far as you should probably go, or 20 if you want Lasting Inspiration.

I did play more of a laid back character (support) initially, and I would probably have been better able to shrug off damage at first.  You can solo with this character afterwards, not a huge tank, but an effective meleer.
