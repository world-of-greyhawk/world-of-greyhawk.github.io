This one does have expertise <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_redface.gif">   <br><br>I wanted to do a dual wielding character that had both devastaing critical and improved whirlwind attack. I did not want to be an RDD. This meant getting the 25 str, 23 dex, and 13 int required would put stats at a premium. Since Halforcs take an int penalty and halflings take a str penalty, I decided that an elf was my best bet. Since the prereqs for improved whirlwind are most of the prereqs for weapon master, I decided that I would be a weapon master. Since my goal is lots of critical hits, I decided to wield either a scimitar, rapier, or kukri. Since my Str was going to top out at 26 (dex at 24), I went with kukri because I did not want to lose the 2 AB I would dual wielding others. If possible, I wanted to get my tumble to 40 (and, maybe, UMD to 31) and uncanny dodge without taking xp penalties. Finally, I decided that I wanted Dev crit first, since I wanted the str for my AB.

I think this build is alot better with dropping the WM levels, although it would be cool to find a way to get a level 9 assassin with imp invis. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  and just wondering, could you post the final AB, AC, HP etc. for this build if that's possible.<br><br>I like the idea. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By antmayfield on 02/17/05 04:08</span></i></p>

I think it would be quite easy to drop the WM levels to 7 and raise Assassin to 11. That would get +3d6 Death Attack, more skill points, and crucially, Improved Invisibility. As the character cannot HiPS, Improved Invis would go a very longway to improving its longevity.<br><br>The only thing lost by dropping the WM levels is 1 AB and potentially some hit points too.

Actually, if you were to take 13 Rogue rather than 13 WM you would save yourself a ton of feats, and with 1 more point in Dex you would qualify for Epic Dodge.  <br><br>In addition, skill credits wouldn't be nearly so tight, and although your threat range and crit multiplier would be down a little, you'd have 7d6 sneak attacks to make up for it. <br><br>Then, if you were to do something like 5 SD rather than 5 Assassin, that would get you HiPS and Defensive Roll, so that you could take another Rogue feat, either Crippling Strike or Skill Mastery.  <br><br>Just a suggestion.

The whole point was to get Improved Whirlwind and Dev Crit.  You need all of the Weapon Master feats for Improved Whirlwind. This is why I went weapon master.  I had already qualified.<br><br>I do not deny that a Fighter/Rogue/Shadowdancer with Epic Dodge and Dev Crit is a better build than this.  I would rather play one myself.<br><br>This build is very much a one trick pony.  An exercise in mathematics if you will.  I wasn't looking for the most powerful build, I was looking to make an interesting combination that had not been posted yet.<br><br>The comments about taking more assassin lvls for the Improved Invis are pretty much spot on, though.  I was thinking to much along the lines of "only 26 STR, need to get the AB up."  The human version where I was able to get to 19 WM lvls makes sense.  This version sacrifices 6 lvls that would be better spent as 4 assassin and 2 fighter lvls.  At least that is how I would do it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>I think I might be able to make a human fighter/WM/rogue with improved whirlwind, dev crit, and Epic dodge and no xp penalties.  I haven't sit down to figure it out, yet, though.  May do that later today.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.rpgmods.net/forgottenworlds/phpBB2/" target="_blank">Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Yar Stardawg on 02/28/05 20:31</span></i></p>
