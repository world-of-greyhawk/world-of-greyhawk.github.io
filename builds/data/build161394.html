Hey all.<br><br>I was looking for something rather different to work on, and i have been wanting to work a shifter for some time.  I had this idea and id love any kind of input into the build.<br><br>Elf,  true neutral<br>str 13  dex 10  w17   int 10  con 10  ch 14<br><br>1  druid1          Alertness<br>2  druid2<br>3  druid3          Power Attack<br>4  druid4   w18<br>5  druid5<br>6  shifter1        Cleave<br>7  shifter2 <br>8  shifter3 w19<br>9  shifter4        Wpn Foc: Longsword<br>10 shifter5<br>11 shifter6<br>12 CoT1     w20    Wpn Prof: Exotic<br>13 CoT2            Improve Crit: Longsword<br>14 CoT3<br>15 CoT4         Imp Crit:scythe/ wpn foc:Unarmd #1<br>16 CoT5     w21<br>17 CoT6            Great Cleave<br>18 CoT7            Toughness<br>19 CoT8            Wpn foc: scythe<br>20 CoT9     w22<br>21 shifter7        Epic wpn foc: longsword<br>22 shifter8<br>23 shifter9<br>24 shifter10 w23   Undead shape<br>25 CoT10           Epic Wpn foc: scythe<br>26 shifter11<br>27 shifter12       Great wis I<br>28 shifter13* w25  Outsider shape  <br>29 shifter14<br>30 shifter15       Great charisma I<br>31 shifter16*      Great wis II<br>32 CoT11      w27<br>33 shifter17       Construct #2<br>34 CoT12<br>35 CoT13**         Epic Prowess<br>36 CoT14      ch17 Great Charisma II<br>37 CoT15<br>38 CoT16**         Armor skin<br>39 CoT17           Great charisma III<br>40 CoT18      ch19<br><br>#1/#2- these are feats i am not sure about<br>* designates a shifter epic bonus feat<br>** designates a CoT epic bonus feat<br><br>end stats<br>str 13  dex 10 int 10 wis27  cha19 con 10<br><br>The idea of this build is to use the Epic Drow as a main combat shape, with Risen lord as an alternative (would say main, but has a limit of 3 per day so..) and to have the unlimited ice storm of raksha available if needed.  I noticed the iron golem hits hard so i was wondering what your folks opinions are of taking unarmed feats to improve upon that.  I could take less charisma feats to add to it, or if construct isnt really worth it..?  <br><br>Any suggestions PLZ!<br><br>Peace<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 20:28</span></i></p>

Move levelling around so that you have 10 shifter level before 20. If I remember my numbers correctly that gets you a BAB of 16 still being 5 druid/10 shifter/5 CoT (I may be wrong as I'm doing it from work without any books in front of me). The benefit of this is you can then take your bonus CoT feats from the epic list.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

erm.. actually, if I read it right; 8lvls not 10.  The levels got 3ab per 4; so you would be wasting a possible ab - the difference of an extra attack _is- still a difference you will feel.

Can you tell me what reason there is to take greater cha?  Just can't see it...<br><br>With COT you should be able to get Dragon shape easily.  Really, all the shapes are good now since you can merge more items with most of them.<br><br>I'd like to note that you can get epic weap foc and epic prowess for unarmed but it doesn't seem like regular weap foc helps.

Thanks for the input.<br><br>The reason for 9 cot lvls before lv 20 is to get 4 attacks per round. This gives me a nice base for a melee character (drow/risen lord.. possible iron golem)<br><br>Thank you for the post epic cot level suggestion, but im really not that interestd in epic cot feats.  I am debating whether or not to keep wisdom at 27!  The only real benefit that epic cot lvls would give (if i see it right) would be great wisdom and initiatives..  <br><br>The reason for the charisma increase is to make use of cot abilities: lay of hands, smite evil, divine wrath are all influenced by charisma.<br><br>I have been looking at what i was wondering about: unarmed and i think wpn foc:unarmem is needed if i am to use iron golem, as is epic wpn foc in this area, which means at least 2 substituted feats.<br><br>Elf, true neutral<br>str 13 dex 10 w17 int 10 con 10 ch 14<br><br>1 druid1 Alertness<br>2 druid2<br>3 druid3 Power Attack<br>4 druid4 w18<br>5 druid5<br>6 shifter1 Cleave<br>7 shifter2 <br>8 shifter3 w19<br>9 shifter4 Wpn Foc: Longsword<br>10 shifter5<br>11 shifter6<br>12 CoT1 w20 Wpn Prof: Exotic<br>13 CoT2 Improve Crit: Longsword<br>14 CoT3<br>15 CoT4 Imp Crit:scythe/ wpn foc:Unarmd<br>16 CoT5 w21<br>17 CoT6 Great Cleave<br>18 CoT7 Toughness<br>19 CoT8 Wpn foc: scythe<br>20 CoT9 w22<br>21 shifter7 Epic wpn foc: longsword<br>22 shifter8<br>23 shifter9<br>24 shifter10 w23 Undead shape<br>25 CoT10 Epic Wpn foc: scythe<br>26 shifter11<br>27 shifter12 Great wis I<br>28 shifter13* w25 Outsider shape <br>29 shifter14<br>30 shifter15 Epic wpn foc: unarmd<br>31 shifter16* Great wis II<br>32 CoT11 w27<br>33 shifter17 Construct <br>34 CoT12<br>35 CoT13** Epic Prowess<br>36 CoT14 ch17 Great Charisma I<br>37 CoT15<br>38 CoT16** Armor skin<br>39 CoT17 Great charisma II<br>40 CoT18 ch18<br><br>This makes the character alittle better in melee with the iron golem shape.  I have less charisma, but is 18 really less than 19?  LOL <br><br>Anyway, If anyone has any ideas on the validity of the iron golem, plz let me know.<br><br>Thanks for the input<br><br>PEACE

This really isn't the forum to discuss class abilities. Helping tweak a build is one thing, but class discussion or discussion how to use a class should be in the general forums.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

I was trying to decide which forum to post this one in, thank you for pointing that out  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>It is a fact that this build is COMPLETE.  It is a legit build, it is a viable build. It is even an EPIC build, whatever that means.  <br><br>I was asking advice on how to make it better, which is why i thought we were all here.<br><br>peace

Actually, discussing about the class abilities would be best suited to be posted in the Information about Classes forums. After all, it would be useful information for others to use. Especially that it will be compiled so it can be used as a reference(off-line that is).<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.
