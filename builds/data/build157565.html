This is my way to try to emulate the PrC Eldritch Knight (available in the PRC) with Bioware classes.

You can use some spells when your axes don't go through, but you don't have the spells DC of a dedicated wizard, so don't get your hopes too high.

Interesting build. I have two thoughts:<br><br>1. If the wizard levels are mainly for buffing is it necessary to go all the way to Wizard 27? Wouldn't those levels be better spent on the martial classes to improve AB?<br><br>2. If you're taking Exotic Weapon Proficiency for Dwarven War Axes, and going to dual-wield, why not specialize in Double-Bladed Axe? Reason being that doesn't a two-handed weapon give you 1.5 x strength bonus in damage?<br><br>Thanks for posting!<br>Kaliban.

You lose one Wizard bonus feat, so I'd probably get rid of Hellball.  I would pick up Toughness to help your HP, and maybe Blind-Fight as well, since as of 1.64 True Seeing won't help you hit enemies with concealment bonuses.  <br><br>I would probably get rid of combat casting and Improved Combat Casting.  You can avoid AoO's by casting in Defensive Casting mode, so no need to waste 2 feats.  If you go Dwarven you get +2 Con at creation (-2 Cha though, and 1 less feat and 1 less skill credit per level), so that would add another +40 HP to your character, in addition to Toughness.   <br><br>Also, why no Dev. Crit?  You should be able to get your Str high enough with this kind of build.  Even if you server doesn't allow Dev. Crit., higher Str would get you a better AB, and certainly Overwhelming Crit would be helpful (another 3d6 damage on a critical).  <br><br>Also, I agree with the above poster.  Although dwarven waraxes may look cool, I probably wouldn't dual-wield them, as this will give you a -4 penalty to your AB.  Using a double-axe you would only suffer a -2 penalty to AB, and you would do at most 2 points less damage on a successful hit.  Alternatively, using a Greataxe would save you 4 feats (Exotic + 3 dual-wielding feats), and get you a better base damage, although you'd lose a couple attacks per round. <br><br>If you want to maximize your AB, you will want as many Fighter and WM levels as possible pre-epic.  If you go Fighter 9/Wizard 4/WM 7 pre-epic, you get a pre-epic AB of +18, which should be 2 points better than the build you have now.  Of course, then you can't take Auto-Still Spell I until level 33 at the earliest, but you should still be able to get Auto-Still Spell III by level 36, since that will end up as a Wizard bonus feat level.

Like i said earlier, any weapon choice is valid, some better than others. Sure, double axe gives +2 AB, but it's easier to find a good dwarven waraxe (even two) than a good double axe on many servers. Also, 2 weapons look cooler than a double one.<br><br>27 Wizard ? Well, strange thing, i never thought about dumping more levels elsewhere. 27 gives me 2 free epic feats, and this build being short on feats, i thought it could use them. 23 wizard is nice too, losing an epic feat and a little power/duration on spells in exchange for 2 BAB, 2 non epic combat feats and up to 24 hp. It's up to you. I guess i had planned max wizard and thus i didn't need more than 6 fighter and 7 weapon master.<br><br>Why human instead of dwarf ? dwarves look ugly, smelly, and i like good-looking characters. But dwarf remain a valid choice if you can find the lacking feat and can stand the loss of a skill.<br><br>Why improved combat casting ? Well, this is a combat caster, the choice seemed obvious. Defensive casting mode is an active combat mode, takes time to activate.<br><br>Why no blind fight ? I need that feat, but i couldn't afford it. Like i said earlier, this build is short on feats.<br><br>Why no dev crit ? First cos i don't have 25 strengh. Second cos i have neither cleave nor overwelming crit. Third, read my signature.<br>_________________<br>If you call IGMS, Harm, Mestil's acid shield, the Bigby hands or Devastating Critical balanced in your post, don't expect me to like you.<br><br>I'm sorry about my bad english, I'm french.<br>In every lie lies a part of truth.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Agifem on 10/08/04 14:55</span></i></p>

Did you consider using Bladesinger instead of EK? You get a hit on spells, for certain, but the rapier or LS aspect of the BS class would go well with WM. Also, you get the great uplift to AC from intelligence, which complements the wizard's attribute.
