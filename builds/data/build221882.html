In medium armor it will range between 20% and 30% - not great, but somewhat acceptable.  Magic armors that have arcane failure reductions tend to be medium or light class armors, as well.  Keep in mind that you can get AC 30 in scale-class medium armor with a lower arcane failure by buffing your dex to 18 - that's comparable to a plate-wearer without a shield.<br><br><b>Q:  Why take EDR?  Why not pump your strength through the stratosphere instead?</b><br>A:  Because with 28 str you reach a very reasonable AB for a melee (+41) which you can buff quite nicely and add on some extra damage to.  EDR plus some barbarian DR really takes the edge off of physical attacks, however.<br><br><b>Q:  Why take called shot and improved knockdown?</b><br>A:  Because I find they both synergize really well in builds that combine a decent AB, bard/curse song, and taunt.  IKD is a great ability but some enemies will be immune to knockdowns, which is where called shot comes in.<br><br><b>Q:  Why do you consider concentration an optional skill?</b><br>A:  Well I wouldn't go without it but you can squeak by in some environments by buffing entirely outside of combat.  Unfortunately that means if your buffs start to drop mid-fight you may have to finish the battle without them.  Personally, I made the investment into concentration but some people might not want to.<br><br><b>Q:  Why not take Still Spell?</b><br>A:  You can, but this character is meant to strip-buff extended spells as much as possible and then gamble on arcane failure, trying to minimize it by using scale-class armor when possible, if he has to.<br><br><b>Q:  What tactics might not be obvious with this character?</b><br>A:  Singing your bard and curse songs before using terrifying rage will effectively give you +3 to its DC: +2 intimidate from bard song and -1 enemy saves from curse.<br><br>The level 5 spell Mind Fog inflicts a -10 penalty to will saves vs mind spells and effects if the enemy fails their will save vs the Fog.  Terrifying rage is affected.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> <br><br>You have uncanny dodge from your barbarian levels so you don't have to be afraid of flat-footedness; this is especially handy because bardsong AC counts as Dodge AC.<br><br>You can buff improved invisibility for a conceal bonus, then use darkness and ultravision to inflict an attacker miss chance too.  Singing both songs can make you even harder to hit by effectively improving your AC by +5.<br><br>The spells Balagarn's Iron Horn, Darkness, Displacement, and War Cry can be cast in armor without arcane failure.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Nice build, I'd personally go for heavy armor and less dex starting. Also, when going for terrifying rage I find it useful to get ESF: Intimidate.<br>If starting with STR 15 and DEX 12, Great STR I becomes not necessary anymore and the feat slot opens up for ESF intimidate for example. If wearing heavy armor one loses just one from Ref saves.<br>Just a quick thought, nothing more<br>Cheers<br><br><i> Edit </i><br>Ps: seeing you end with 21 CON, in the above example I would drop Dex to 10 and start with 15 CON for +40 HP in the end<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 11/27/05 21:55</span></i></p>

This is a nice powerful class combo.  Buffing spells, buffing rage, UMD, bard song, RDD immunities and boni...i mean, what more does a char want?<br><br>nice take on the barb/bard/rdd.  looks like a lota fun to play.  i like the note about armour.  some places to have some good spell-failure-reducing armours.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger."

You could sub the Great Strength feat for Great Con and Epic Prowess for Great Str again to gain 40 HP, losing only that one point of AB.

I don't mind the uneven numbers.  Since he's a melee build and he already has over 500 hp (and can get 120 more by raging) I don't really feel that seeking out an additional 40 hp at the expense of AB is very worthwhile.<br><br>He has 21 con for EDR, that's all.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
