The title pretty much describes it. I do not care how playable it is... I just want it to be able to block any attack, Melee or Spell. So pretty much I want a build with good ac and saves and dodge

Dex based EDin' monk?  Great AC potential, great saves, spell resistance, epic dodge, maybe self concealment... plus a bunch of immunities tossed in for good taste.

Halfling or ElfMonk35/SD5. Dex based. <br><br>-Epic Dodge<br>-SR 45 natural, but add a bunch of SR feats, as many as you can get. Should be really hard to kill, but will also be really hard to kill with. Gets good stealth and stunning fist though, so you make them vulnerable to other folks attack.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Monk 35 / Shadowdancer 5 is better than Monk 34 / Shadowdancer 5 / Fighter 1, it was actually my mistake to take the Fighter level on that build (which was pointed out by Kamiryn), go with what Grim suggested. My build there could work as example though, at least it won't become illegal after version 1.69 comes out, Epic Dodge is taken at level 36...<br><br>I could ask why you need such a build? I've played it and it sucks to be a super tank that kills no one, at least it wasn't really fun from my perspective.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/14/08 23:05 (GMT) -- Monk9292<br>and why halfing or elf?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Elf and Halfing start with more DEX, which is useful to get Epic Dodge ASAP, Shadowdancer as Prestige Class won't give you XP penalty.<br>_________________<br>The world is full of lies! “Thou shalt not kill”, “Thou shalt not steal”.

The beauty of this build though, which has not been pointed out, is it's defense against the best hitters of them all namely Arcane Archers. 50% concealment, high AC, Epic Dodge and deflect arrows would make it very effective against AA's.<br><br>Also, it seems based on comments in the build thread that flanking alone removes all Dodge(including tumble) AC. IIRC it doesn't. It gives +2 AB to the attacker though. But you need to catch a fella flatfooted for him to loose all that AC, flanking alone won't do it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Also, Thax's build can be easily made into a half decent meleer just adding Finesse, WF/EWF and EP and getting the 5th SD lvl in epic. Final result 37 AB which can be considered acceptable in such a high defense build.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

You can adapt this build to almost any race, because no one has dex penalties.<br>Go dwarf or gnome if you want more Con and more HP, or Elf or halfling for Dex and AC,<br><br>Your aim is SR IX to become near immune to spellcasters (your SR will be 35 + 10 + 18 = 63, a lev 40 wiz with ESP and a roll of 20 will have 40 + 6 + 20 = 66) and ED to avoid as many hits as possible.<br>Monk's feats progression in epica is awful so you'll be feat starved.<br>Empty body for 35 rounds is really good!

I mainly want this for rp reasons. I do not really want a tank, but I want someone who wont die in PvP. He is going to be a man of peace and still wants to be able to block most attacks without dieing.
