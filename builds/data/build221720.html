Not sure if there is a niche market for this little guy, but this is for all those Fighter10/Rogue2/Weaponmaster28’s in the world.  Good night, and good luck!<br><br>The premise of this build is to build a stealth character who can go quite high on the Stunning Fist DC(45 minimum), paralyze opponents in the first round, and finish them with sneak damage.  I attempted about 15 different variations, and found the build that <i>did not</i> have Monk to be the most lethal.  However, all of the Monk variants enjoyed a much higher AC—between 36-40 in most of them—, but still had problems doing damage.  It would have been nice to even have taken 1 level of Monk, but as soon as one does, the number of Stunning Fists you have become assigned to that Monk level.  Only if one takes 11+ levels of Monk can you get more Stunning Fists than with a non-monk character.  Still, I enjoyed high success with a Monk19/SD5/Ftr16.  <br><br>There’s some irony in that I achieved my best results with a non-monk Halfling.  If one were really hellbent on cranking the DC, there are quite a few Fighter Bonus feats in Epic that could still be spent on Improved Stunning Fist (4 to be exact).  That would give a DC of 53.  Few, if any, will make that save continuously.  With 13 Stunning Fists at your disposal, you can let her rip.  Beware, however, of Palemasters—those things that are immune to Crits are Immune to Stunning Fist.  Not to mention your Sneaks.<br><br><b>The Shadowboxer</b><br><br><i>PvP Only, Level 40 Build</i><br><br>Rogue19/Fighter20/Shadowdancer1<br>Race: Halfling<br>Alignment: Any<br><br><b>Attributes</b><br>Str12<br>Int10<br>Wis16 (20)<br>Dex18 (30)<br>Con10<br>Chr8<br><br><b>Level Guide</b><br>1Rogue1, Dodge<br>2Fighter1, Weapon Finesse<br>3Rogue2, Improved Unarmed Strike<br>4Fighter2, WF: Unarmed Strike, Dex19<br>5Fighter3<br>6Fighter4, WS: Unarmed Strike, Mobility<br>7Rogue3<br>8Rogue4, Dex20<br>9Rogue5, Blindfighting<br>10Rogue6<br>11Rogue7<br>12Rogue8, Stunning Fist, Dex21<br>13Rogue9<br>14Rogue10, Improved Evasion<br>15Rogue11, Extra Stunning Attacks<br>16Rogue12, Dex22<br>17Rogue13, Defensive Roll<br>18Rogue14, Defelct Arrows<br>19Rogue15<br>20Fighter5, Dex23<br>21Fighter6, Great Dex I, EWF: Unarmed Strike<br>22Shadowdancer1<br>23Fighter7<br>24Rogue16, Great Dex II, Epic Dodge, Dex26<br>25Fighter8, EWS: Unarmed Strike<br>26Fighter9<br>27Rogue17, Great Wisdom I<br>28Fighter10, Epic Prowess, Wis18<br>29Fighter11<br>30Fighter12, Great Wisdom I, Armor Skin<br>31Fighter13<br>32Rogue18, Wis20<br>33Fighter14, Improved Stunning Fist I, Great Dex III<br>34Fighter15<br>35Fighter16, Improved Stunning II<br>36Fighter17, Great Dex IV, Dex29<br>37Fighter18, Improved Stunning III<br>38Fighter19<br>39Fighter20, Improved Stunning IV, V<br>40Rogue19, Crippling Strike, Dex30<br><br><b>Combat Vitals</b><br>Naked AB: 41/36/31/26<br>Naked AC: 31(32)<br>Hit Points: 362<br>Damage: 1d2 Fists +7 +10d6sneak<br><br><b>Shadowboxer’s Arsenal</b><br>Stunning Fist DC: <b>45</b> (+10 enhancements = 50DC)<br>Stunning Fists per Day: 13<br>Crippling Strike<br>Epic Dodge<br>Hide in Plain Sight<br>Deflect Arrows against troublesome AAs<br><br><br><b>Saves</b><br>Fort: 20(23)<br>Will: 22 (25)<br>Reflex: 33 (36)<br><br><b>Skills:</b><br>Discipline: 0 (1)<br>Tumble: 40<br>Hide: 43 (53)<br>Move Silently: 43 (55)<br>UMD: 36(35)<br>Listen: 40 (47)<br>Spellcraft: 10<br><br>A one-trick pony?

I do love this concept, Grizz. Full marks for originality! Are you even certain this isn't playable PvM? You could use a finessable weapon and shield if need be and go with your stealth Rogue tactics.

Hm, it is a funny little cretin. A rogue with UMD should be playable. I too have noticed that unarmed is almost as good as weapons with a dex sneaker, I found that with my Tiny Reaper.<br><br>Regarding the little Death attack vs Stunning fist debate you run with yourself here, it is much easier to protect against Death attack.

I figured he might have a hard time pre-epic until he got Stunning Fist going, but he still sports a high Dex and weapon Finesse and good sneak damage.  His Will save will be way above the average Rogue, so there is some potential there.  <br><br>In the original level scheme, I placed SD1 at Level8 to help contribute to the playability.  In doing so, 3 of the pre-epic Rogue levels had to be pushed to Epic, and 2 fighter levels had to be pulled back to pre-epic.  This allowed a 16BAB to be maintained as well as securing Toughness pre-epic, but Epic Dodge is delayed by one level, EWS by 4, and Stunning Fist DC drops by 2.  Worth doing if you really want HiPS early and Toughness, but otherwise I'd leave it as is.<br><br>But I still think his best career lies in the hands of a disgruntled PvPer who has been getting critted by some Weaponmaster from Hell.  The simple beauty in this guy is that he can just walk up to somebody, touch them, and then kill them.  No items, no buffs, no enhancements, no weapons, no armour, no anything.  Hell, when I did playtests I forgot to invest skillpoints into, well, everything (wait, I did have 10 Hide, 7MS, 5 Tumble for SD requirements).  You walk up to your opponent, you don't even have to HiPS, Stunning Fist their butt and then 120d6 sneak dice should do the job.  For those who want a no-HiPSter version, I would go Rogue20/Ftr10/CoT10.  The only difference is that you have higher saves but no HiPS.  Otherwise everything remains the same(well, you do need to take a Focus is a melee weapon, perhaps shortsword, handaxe or mace, as you combo that with a shield).<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 11/27/05 01:46</span></i></p>

I want to give you credit for this one!<br><br>You ask about it's usefulness other than PvP.<br><br>I took the build to the toolkit and made two NPC blueprints. One lvl 40 identical to yours, and one lvl 30 with a little less sting, and still a legal build.<br><br>I use them in hostile encounters in some new epic areas I've made on the Anchorome pw where I play, build and DM.<br><br>The players really struggle with the stunning fist/sneak attack combination. And people think they are monks, and don't understand why they hit so hard. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"><br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan

Once it get epic dodge, this build becomes quite playable PvM in my experience.  Especially in a low magic setting.  It's definately one of my favorite builds in the guild.

Heh, I love this build, not only for its considerable merit but also for breaking the mold on stunners.  Non-monk stunner opens up such possibilities.  Cheers, Grizzled Short One.<br><br>Ithacan (&lt;---- wonders if being a grizzled for a dwarflord is like being clean shaven for a human?)
