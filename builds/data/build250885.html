Wow! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">   This is one of the most unique builds I've seen in a while.  It almost qualifies as a fire and forget weapon.  I guess in a PvP environment this build can cause major pain in 12 rounds.  You might also want to test it against dracolich (who can self harm about 3 times) to see how it does.  I imagine a demi-lich wouldn't even last a round!  It isn't really playable, but for 12 rounds such short lived uberness! Well done Thaxll'ssyllia, I believe this qualifies as art rather than a build.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

A monk/kama based divine champion. And you go all the way.<br><br>AB is ok when Divine wrath is active and when you smite. But it will be a bit low when not.<br><br>Damage output is very good with Divine wrath and Divine might active. You have plenty of uses per day of Divine might/shield. Smite damage is so,so. But at least you have the AB bonus 3 times per day.<br><br>I miss more paladin in a build like this, because the spells will be good for the AB.<br><br>There is one issue: You need to rearrange the feats so you have Weapon focus to qualify for CoT.<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan

52 skillpoints, huh?  How old was he when he learned to tie his shoes <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> ?<br><br>Also, your Level 30 Divine Wrath DR should be 25/+5, I believe, not 5/+1 (a pleasant surprise, no doubt <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  ).<br><br>Other than those nitpicks, its a nice one trick pony.
