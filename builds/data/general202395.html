OK so i know monk is a not too powerfull on its own, but IMO i've come up with a build that can represent monk as a good feature class in the bioware epic build page.

Sounds nice!!! There are a couple of similar builds already posted in the guild. I've posted a monk build using rogue and CoT. Also I've posted a Monk / ftr / weaponmaster. I like your use of dd as it makes an extremely tough monk!!<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick.

Thanks for your comments. I built this because never before had i built a monk with a decent AB with the fist. It turned out that i had a really tough build instead! I think 43 AB is a bit low for my likings, and if i am in an AB mood i switch 4 DD for 4 Fighter to get epic prowess.<br><br>The thing is when i try for 45 or 46 AB whith non-Kama monks is i end up doing hardly any monk! With kamas u can actually do weapon master and get about 48 AB. The thing is when monsters are imune to crits u just wackem and not do any damage.<br><br>When I get round to it i will submit some of my builds to the list. But for now i still wonder why bioware doesent put a monk centred build on its page. Every other bloody build is there.<br><br>The real reason i play monk is because of so many cool abilitys so u never get bored. The speed helps too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br><br>I'll stop yabbering on now before i bore evry one to death...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Abadname on 07/05/05 05:59</span></i></p>
