Another "spellsword"  build, this one focusing on ranged combat. AA lvls nicely pump up AB and dmg output too (equivalent to WS/EWS), buffs will greatly help survivability (lvl 6 spells are available already before any AA lvls) as will summons. There's a good deal of compromises in this build, but spellswords are always such.<br><br><br><br><b>******************************</b><br><br><br><br><b>Boccob's Magic Arrow - Wizard(27), Rogue(2), Arcane Archer(11) </b><br>Elf, any alignment<br><i>PvM, playable 1-40</i><br><br><br><br><b>ABILITIES (ending)</b><br>STR: 12<br>DEX: 18 (30)<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 16 (20)<br>CHA: 8<br><br><br><b>BASIC STATS</b><br>Hitpoints: 248<br>Skillpoints: 276<br><br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/19/30<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Mind Effects: +2, Evasion<br><br>BAB: 24<br>AB : 26 (melee), 44 (ranged)<br><br>AC (naked/shield only): 30/33<br><br>Spell Casting: Wizard(9)<br>Spells/Day: 4/6/5/5/5/5/4/4/4/4<br><br><br><b>SKILLS</b><br>Concentration 42(43), Disable Trap 41(48), Open Lock 10(20), Search 34(41), Set Trap 33(45), Spellcraft 40(45), Tumble 40(50), UMD 36(35), no points leftover<br><br><br><b>LEVELING GUIDE</b><br>01: Wizard(1): Point Blank Shot, {Scribe Scroll}<br>02: Wizard(2)<br>03: Wizard(3): Rapid Shot<br>04: Wizard(4): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br>05: Wizard(5): Craft Wand<br>06: Wizard(6): Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>07: Wizard(7)<br>08: Wizard(8): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>09: Wizard(9): Blind Fight<br>10: Wizard(10): Extend Spell<br>11: Wizard(11)<br>12: Wizard(12): DEX+1, Spell Penetration, (DEX=21)<br>13: Arcane Archer(1)<br>14: Arcane Archer(2)<br>15: Arcane Archer(3): Improved Critical: Longbow<br>16: Arcane Archer(4): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>17: Arcane Archer(5)<br>18: Arcane Archer(6): Greater Spell Penetration<br>19: Arcane Archer(7)<br>20: Arcane Archer(8): INT+1, (INT=17)<br>21: Arcane Archer(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>22: Wizard(13)<br>23: Rogue(1)<br>24: Wizard(14): INT+1, Epic Prowess, (INT=18)<br>25: Wizard(15): Great Intelligence I, (INT=19)<br>26: Wizard(16)<br>27: Wizard(17): Armor Skin<br>28: Wizard(18): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br>29: Wizard(19)<br>30: Wizard(20): Great Dexterity I, Great Intelligence II, (DEX=24), (INT=20)<br>31: Wizard(21)<br>32: Wizard(22): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br>33: Wizard(23): Great Dexterity II, Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor, (DEX=26)<br>34: Wizard(24)<br>35: Wizard(25)<br>36: Wizard(26): DEX+1, Great Dexterity III, Epic Spell: Epic Warding, (DEX=28)<br>37: Arcane Archer(10)<br>38: Arcane Archer(11)<br>39: Wizard(27): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=29)<br>40: Rogue(2): DEX+1, {Evasion}, (DEX=30)<br><br><br><br><b>******************************</b><br><br><br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><b>•</b>Good AB, especially for a spellsw... arrow <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><b>•</b>Good naked AC<br><b>•</b>EMA, EW for high lvl play<br><b>•</b>Undispellability<br><b>•</b>Autopenetrates SR 32<br><b>•</b>Lvl 9 wizard spells<br><b>•</b>Epic trap skills<br><b>•</b>UMD<br><b>•</b>Evasion (late) plus a good Ref save<br><b>•</b>Craft Wand<br><br><br><i>Weaknesses</i><br><b>•</b>Low HPs<br><b>•</b>Slow caster progression<br><b>•</b>Poor Fort and Will saves (good vs spells though)<br><b>•</b>3 APR (although haste and RS bring them to 5 and DP scrolls add another 1)<br><b>•</b>No melee skills (I don't like Finesse in AAs)<br><b>•</b>Could use some more skillpoints<br><b>•</b>Tight on feats<br><br><br><br><b>******************************</b><br><br><br><br>No such builds in the search engine.

I've always been unsure about building a spellbow...

You've got a fairly decent AB <b>and</b> lvl 9 spells. As I said, only 3 buffs are unnecessary and those are usually covered with gear.<br><br>Playing it has its difficulties, of course, but not worse than melee spellswords. FTR/AA is stronger AB wise, evidently, but you can't really compare them since they are supposed to be played totally differently. FTR/AA can't cast TS, can't bigby, can't IGMS, etc. It's a whole different ballgame.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

At high levels at least, and possibly very much earlier than that this build would chew a fighter/AA to pieces without breaking sweat. That said, I feel characters such as this uses melee/bow to save some spells. In servers with rest-restrictions these builds truly reach their usefulness IMO. And the fact that your head will still have hair when you encounter that pesky piercing resistance is also a major factor. Not to mention those times when you encounter spell-resistant enemies. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

I like it, but have a question it seems like a waste to have 30 dex and no uncanny dodge did you consider a 3rd rogue lvl for it and drop 1 wizard lvl or was it not even a consideration.  <br><br><br><br><br><br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/07/07 05:44 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   I just care about killing first.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Well it is true he can cast level 9 spells and has a decent AB, bow damage is still higher than non-AA builds, maybe I'm just obsessed about it, when I play Arcane Archers every flurry always hits and for heavy damage, but yeah, that's a different build alright.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
