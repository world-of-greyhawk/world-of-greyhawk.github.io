I'm hoping someone can help me build a character, most preferably a dwarven defender, that can win almost any fight just by surviving.  I know that 12 maximized IGMS will take down anything, but in most NORMAL fights it would be great to take a pounding and just stand there asking, "are you done yet?"  The "battle of 20s" is what I'm looking for.  If we have the same percentages to hit each other, and I have DR 30/-, then I should win.  Please help me with this build.  I made the "Epitome of Defense," but they said it lacked offensive ability.  I don't want offensive ability.  I want to win in a war of attrition.<br><br>Thanks for the help,<br><br>King Harbromm

No disrespect toward the mighty dwarflord's build, but it's too oriented on offense for my liking.  I have, however, tried his build out when I was looking for a good build for a PW I play on and loved it.  It's a GREAT build that blends both defense and offense.  I'm looking for that build, though, that is the embodiment of defense.<br><br>Thanks for the suggestion, though,<br><br>King Harbromm

But I suppose you could run it from the HP/DR side as well.  Below is just a pure DwD.

If you really don't care about offense and are going with Grizz's build, leave STR as is, pump CON all the way, forget about Epic Prowess and EWF, and take Epic Energy Resist feats or Epic Toughness feats as your DwD bonus feats (and DR, of course). In fact, start with 20 CON, 12 STR, and 13 INT.<br><br>Remember the Epic Energy Resist feats don't stack with the pre-epic ones, so take save-boosting feats pre-epic instead.<br><br>You may even want to think about Improved Unarmed Strike and Deflect Arrows. That way you'll get a chance to avoid the first ranged attack of every round as well.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...
