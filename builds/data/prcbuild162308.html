The Assasins of Khan is an arrogant group of Githzerai assasins. Everybody knows who they are, but noone sees them before it's too late. They have no mercy, and no doubts. They are true assasins.<br><br>Githzerai<br>Lawful Evil<br>Monk/Assasin/Shadowdancer 16/19/5<br><br>Starting Abilities:<br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 22<br>CON: 14<br>INT: 14<br>WIS: 12<br>CHA: 8<br><br>All ability increases go into Dexterity.<br><br>Advancement History:<br><br>1-8: Monk, 9: Assasin, 10: Shadowdancer, 11: Assasin, 12: Monk, 13-14: Assasin, 15-18: Shadowdancer, 19-20: Assasin, 21-27: Monk, 28-40: Assasin<br><br>Lvl 1 - Dodge<br>Lvl 3 - Weapon Finesse<br>Lvl 6 - Weapon Focus: Unarmed Strike<br>Lvl 9 - Mobility<br>Lvl 12 - Stealthy*<br>Lvl 15 - Improved Initiative*<br>Lvl 18 - Blind Fight*<br>Lvl 21 - Epic Dodge (of some reason the 30 ranks of Tumble aren't required)<br>Lvl 24 - Epic Skill Focus: Hide<br>Lvl 27 - Epic Skill Focus: Move Silently<br>Lvl 30 - Epic Weapon Focus: Unarmed Strike<br>Lvl 33 - Self-Concealment (SC) I<br>Lvl 35 - SC II<br>Lvl 36 - SC III<br>Lvl 39 - SC IV, SC V<br><br>* Aren't required for the build to work<br><br>Skills:<br><br>The only skills necessary (spelling?) are Hide, Move Silently and Tumble, but other than that, you can do it as you want. I took Listen, Spot and UMD, and used the 10 leftovers for Open Lock. Alternatively you can lower your INT for a few more points of strength for more damage, wisdom for more AC, or whatever you want.<br><br>Other stats:<br><br>HP (max): 40 (SD) + 128 (Monk) + 114 (Assasin) + 80 (CON) = 362.<br>AC: 10 (Base) + 11 (DEX) + 8 (Tumble) + 3 (Innate Monk AC) + 1 (WIS) = 33.<br>AB: 23 (base) + 11 (DEX) + 1 (WF) + 2 (EWF) = 37.<br>Attacks: 35/32/29/26/23 (with Flurry of Blows, 37/34/31/28 without)<br><br>Saves:<br><br>Fortitude: 9 (Monk) + 2 (Assasin) + 1 (SD) + 10 (Epic) = 22<br>Reflex: 9 (Monk) + 5 (Assasin) + 4 (SD) + 10 (Epic) = 28 (the sheet says 39 or something like that, but I calculated it to be sure. Have I overlooked something?)<br>Will: 9 (Monk) + 2 (Assasin) + 1 (SD) + 10 (Epic) = 22<br><br>All information above is with the character completely naked.<br><br>Pros:<br>SC V, Epic Dodge and a naked AC of 33 makes the assasin very hard to hit.<br>Has Hide in Plain Sight and a Hide and Move Silently skill modifier of 66.<br>Has a 10d6 Death Attack.<br>Also has Improved Knockdown to disable his opponents temporarily. (I'm not completely sure if Death Attack works with Knockdown the same way as Sneak Attack does)<br><br>Cons:<br>Mediocre saves.<br>Death attack only has a DC of 31.<br>Mediocre AB.<br><br>Authors comments:<br>I'm quite satisfied with this, as it is my first build. What i wanted to create was a build like the Dark Stalker with Epic Dodge and SC V, since it seemed to have lot of feats that weren't very useful. The things i lost was 4d6 Death Attack, 5 DA DC and Search, Disable Trap and Set Trap, which i think is a fair trade-off.<br><br>The reason I chose Assasin instead of Rogue was mostly for roleplaying, and even if the DC isn't high, you can still paralyze your opponent. You can also use the spell-like abilities Invisibility, Improved Invisibility and Darkness.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Youdontwanttoknowit on 11/01/04 06:43</span></i></p>
