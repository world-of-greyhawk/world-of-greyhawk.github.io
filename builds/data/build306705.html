This is the strength version of a build I designed for Badlands 3201 <a href="http://www.badlands.tk/.%29" target="_blank">http://www.badlands.tk/.)</a>  The builds are built for 40v40 PvP but should be fairly easy to level (paladins usually are).<br><br>The Strength version (compared to the dexterity version <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "306706", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> makes a slight sacrifice to AB and Fort in exchange for superior skills and better damage output, including Crippling Strike.  Its AC is fairly solid but depends on Divine Shield.  It is built Elf for keen senses/modal detect.<br><br>Rogue19/Paladin 16/PDK 5<br>Elf<br>Lawful Good <br>PvP 40 only<br><br>Str 16 (10) to 30<br>Dex 10 (0)<br>Con 10 (4)<br>Int 12 (4)<br>Wis 14 (6)<br>Cha 14 (6)<br><br><br>1: Paladin 1– WF Handaxe <br>2: Paladin 2<br>3: Paladin 3 – Blind Fight <br>4: Paladin 4 – STR 17<br>5: Paladin 5 <br>6: Paladin 6 – Mounted<br>7: Paladin 7<br>8: Paladin 8 – STR 18;<br>9: Paladin 9 – Power Attack <br>10: PDK 1 ;<br>11: PDK 2<br>12: PDK 3 - Imp.

Out of curiousity, is there any point to PDK except for being a PDK?

Well, I have to admit that the Badlands staff decided that PDK was completely useless, so they took the buffs and made them a bit better (longer lasting) to make the class worth using.  And I also have to say, they succeeded.  <br><br>I thought it was weird that not one build on the build search machine had PDK but when you remind me of how it actually was implemented (rather than our tweaks), I recall why that would be.<br><br>Yeah, hey, Thax, good to see you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>Strength builds always have an edge, given how knockdown can affect your mortality and disarm your livelihood.  But concentration in 40v40 PvP is underrated.  <br><br>But, of course, build to taste.  All of these builds should be viewed with an eye towards the way you play and the world you play in.  It's no good to build an awesome cornersneaking build if you really like toe-to-toe melee.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Ithacan<br>_________________<br>We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender - Winston Churchill<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Ithacan on 02/21/09 04:06</span></i></p>
