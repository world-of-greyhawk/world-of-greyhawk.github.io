I play at a server called Field of Dreams. It's a server for Epic Characters, and Fields take things a step father buy allowing somewhat buffed equipement (items with +12 ability boosts, dmg reduct, regen, skill boosts, etc. As long as the cost is within 40 levels.) Anyway, the toughest opponents there, in my opinion, are mages. My ranger/sd/assassin build can match some of the best fighters, but when it comes to fighting mages I'm, well, I'm in over my head. I've been watching the AA's in action, and I must say that I am impressed with the speed of which they take down their opponents. I've been muling over several ideas in my head, and figured I would see what your personal opinion is.<br><br>The first AA build is Wizard/AA/SD. Wizard is a good way to go, because once you get to level 20, you get Mordenkainen's Disjuntion; and nobody can resist that. Since an archer should be a high dex based char, I figured SD would complement it nicely with the Uncanny dodges and the all famous Epic Dodge. Lets face it, Archers aren't great when it comes to melee, so they need to be able to get out of harms way fast.<br><br>My other idea was Sorc/AA/RDD. You lose Mordenkainen's Disjuntion, but the RDD provides some excellent ability bonuses; including the +8 str bonus. Thats nice, because it makes reaching Devastating Critical much easier. Also the dmg reduct that comes with Epic RDD is another nice extra bonus.<br><br>My brain is telling me to go with the Wizard/AA/SD build. It's more evasive, and wizard provides some excellent spells. Therefore it seems to be the better choice. But at the same time Rdd provides advatanges. It will help me deal out more dmg than the other build, as well as take more blows.<br><br>~Nelos<br>_________________<br>You can't kill what was simply never there. . .

Yes, and WIZ gets access to it at level 17, not level 20 (SOR at level 18). Or does your server have modifications to the classes?<br>_________________<br>Captain's Log, Stardate 6051: had trouble sleeping last night... my hiatal hernia is acting up.

For some reason I didn't notice it the last time I messed around with sorc <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  I wound up using Sorc, RDD, and SD. My mane focus is still with bow, but I'm not doing so well with it. Am thinking about changing out weapons.<br>_________________<br>You can't kill what was simply never there. . .
