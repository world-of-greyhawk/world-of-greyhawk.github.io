Any thoughts on this? I would like for most of lvls to be in assasin/arcane archer. I am not sure which. Probably save at some point and play both ways. <br><br>Mostly I need help from magic users. I don't know a whole lot about playing mages. But damn do wizards get a lot of exp points. I haven't even gotten out of the prelude and I am almost 4th lvl. <br><br>Plan is to go wizard until I can meet the AA criteria. Then prepare for assasin. <br><br>Starting stats are Str 14, dex 16 const 12, int 16, wis 10 and charisma 8. More of a well-rounded charecter than an uber build.<br><br>Suggestions are most desperately wanted for spells and what to pick for the companion....oops summoned creature. (Ranger habits) I would guess that the panther would be good until I get close to switching classes. When the other classes kick in something like the pixie might be useful for scouting. Anyhow, I am not really sure which spells to pick besides true strike and maybe some buffs. I chose illusion school as my focus which goes well with the theme. <br><br>Any and all help would be appreciated.<br>_________________<br>Entropy is a joule thief

Due to the ignorance of the poster. (me) I think this build would be hopeless. I still would like to try it some day out of curiosity but i think a bard would be more effective.<br>_________________<br>Entropy is a joule thief

Wizzy/ Assassin/ AA are tough to build... I made one, I need to find the build but I know it ended with Wiz 24/ *** 7/ AA 9... with a lot of Int thrown in...  what this gives you that Bard or Bard/ Rogue doesn't is that you don't get to cast Bigbsy spells and then Darkness or Mass Blind/ Deaf on creatures and then fire away with Death Attacks... funner than fun. But Bard is more functionable but definitely not as fun. And when you pop that gaurd that doesn't see you with a quick arrow between the eyes... oh it's so much fun to the little dots swirl around him.
