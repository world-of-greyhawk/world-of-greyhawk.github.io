<b>Playable from 1-40 PvM, PvP vs Good aligned</b><br><br>This is my second version of the Charismatic Dwarf. <br>the other one is here <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "211824", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>This turned out slightly more powerful, but you get those wings everyone seems to be wearing, and v.1 is more playable early on, as this is harder to solo early levels. I enjoyed the other build more, but they serve the same purpose, to send Good-Guy packing.<br><br> This build has fewer feats, the Smite is less powerful, it lacks IKD and has 3 fewer sneak dice. The builds are equal or close in AB, AC, saves and dmg, but this guy can buff better. Plus he can cast Darkness and Ultravision, but it is tough to cast while in armor.

I like this one, although I think your v1 is a bit more to my liking (perhaps it was the story you wrote for it). One thing to note: you can cast Ultravision with your armor off, and then put it on again, as it lasts 1 hour/level and Darkness is a verbal-only spell, so you can cast that one in armor. So, go wreak some havoc!<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Thats what I do with ultravision. Never knew I could cast Darkness with armor, so I've been carrying around a lighter armor, <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  . So thanks. Glad you like it, and I prefer v.1 myself, its more fun for some reason. I have a feeling I'm lacking something with this guy. But with the new Darkness trick he just learned, he will be a little menace for awhile still.
