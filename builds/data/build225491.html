Looks fine enough <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Though I have to ask: why are you boosting Constitution in pre-epic and start picking DR feats so late as 32nd level? I mean yeah, you get more HP early on but seriously. I suggest you either boost Strength in the beginning and plan your Constitution to hit 21 at level 32 or start going for EDR first thing in epic. It's a minor thing.<br><br>Then, EWF &gt; EP (+2 &gt; +1, aye? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> ), pick EWF first.<br><br>And lastly, I'd take Armor Skin in place of Energy Resistance. Though 10/- fire resistance helps if there's PvP - people tend to use Darkfire/Flame Weapon. I guess mobs could use them, too. If that's what you're going after, take two of them. If not, I recommend Armor Skin (now I'm repeating myself <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> ).<br>_________________<br>Surely, without war there would be no loss - hence, no mourning, no grief, no pain, no misery...

WM 8 gives you one more ki damage per day.<br>I'd go FTR 6/WM 8/DwD 26, and change preepic lvling to FTR 6/WM 6/DwD 8 or FTR 6/WM 8/DwD 6 to improve saves. Also, why WIS 9? Put WIS down to 8 and increase DEX to 14, for a +1 ref save. I'd suggest you to take armor skin instead of epic energy resistance, AS it's on the DwD bonus feats list.<br>If you keep 7 FTR then you could drop toughness to make room for WS at 4th lvl and take EWS at 21st lvl.<br>You could actually consider going FTR 10/WM 8/DwD 22. You get 1 more feat at the cost of 3 DR and 8 HPs, WS/EWS would be easier to get.<br><br>Just a few tweaks, the build is a solid tank.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

FinneousPJ,<br>Interesting point about the constitution.<br>Changed it, gives more ab sooner now! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>Also took EDR feats earlier, moved Epic Prowess to the back.<br>So the ab is balanced.<br>About the epic prowess / ewf.. Woah! Don't know how i got that one messed up! Fixed. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Kail Pendragon,<br>Good point about the WM Ki thing, changed that too then.<br>But Toughness is a pre-req to become a DD.<br>So i can't drop that...<br>My goal with this build was a to have a good combination between tanking and damage output.<br>So the 26DD has to stay, as it defines the build imho.<br>To compensate the "low" damage you can always use a 2 handed weapon.<br>(I used a Halberd to do so, gives 17-20/x4, 16-20/x4 with keen even!)<br>And as I said, a party almost always has a cleric or bard whatever. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>With nice buffs!<br><br>I send an update to Griphook!<br>Thanks for the positif stuff.

Me dumb, I forgot DD prerequisites. I need some sleep...<br><br>Sure, FTR 10 was just a possibility, I don't know myself if I would have gone that route. <br>Finn pointed out all the rest so I can just say once more, nice tank!<br><br>Cheers and happy new year to you!<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Listen is something of a pointless skill in my view - anything that can be detected with Listen can be detected with Spot, and Spot can detect some things that Listen can't.<br><br>i'd drop Listen altogether and start with stats of<br>Str 16<br>Dex 13<br>Con 18<br>Int 13<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 6<br>which means you'll be able to drop a Great Con feat in epics.<br><br>instead of taking Toughness on level one, take Mobility, and shift up all the other WM feats. you'll be left with a spare feat on level 6, and you can take Weapon Specialization for +2 damage.<br><br>take Toughness on level 9, Improved Crit on 12, and the two Disarm (or KD) feats on 15 and 18. you miss out Blind Fight but it's worth it for Weapon Spec, tbh.<br><br>then, if you go fighter 6 / WM 7 / DwD 7 pre-epic, you can take Epic Weapon Focus on 21, take level 24 as your 7th Fighter level, and pick up Epic Weapon Specialization, for a further +4 damage.<br><br>so basically you'll be dropping Listen and Blind Fight for +6 damage on every hit.

The emphasis of this build is to defend.<br>Not to be the greatest of damage dealers out there, although he ain't the worst one either.<br><br>Blind fight helps him to be able to defend, even in the, literally, darkest of times.<br><br>Spot and listen because enemies can focus in 1 thing and neglect the other, so you can have a 2nd chance at detecting them.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bearke on 01/12/06 17:19</span></i></p>
