Strength would help AB, Damage, and Discipline. Wisdom would give you more spells and help your Will save.<br>*I'm not sure if Charisma boosting items help your Turn Undead Levels or not. Can anyone verify that?<br>*His saves vs spells are good thanks to 40+ ranks in Spellcraft, but his regular saves are average. Items that boost universal saves would help him in that department.<br>*His HPs are low for a melee character, but Endurance(+40 or 80) and Battlemaster(+160) can give you a nice boost.<br>*Having access to all Cleric spells plus Greater Ruin and Hellball gives you a lot of buffs and offensive spells to use in combat.<br>*Variants: If you want a high level Cleric that isn't specialized vs Undead you can always change the Sun domain to something more your style (Heal, Magic, etc.). Also, the Spell Penetration and Armor Skin feats could be switched out for other feats you desire (Maximize Spell, Epic Prowess, etc.).<br>_________________<br>By the age of 18, the average American has witnessed 200,000 acts of violence on television, most of them occurring during Game 1 of the NHL playoff series. ~Steve Rushin

**disclaimer**(the veiws expressed here are my own opinion and not meant as a personal attack towards anyone)<br><br>That's not a bad build, it seems more like a melee cleric than anything else. You'll be able to take on undead pretty well with it.<br><br>There are a couple of things I don't like about it. With melee builds, hit points are always important. The 10 con seems to low for a build of this type, I would try to reduce you str and cha a touch to get con up to 14.<br><br>What is the point of taking cleave and greater cleave? It has been my experience that when fighting things that are weak enough to effect with cleave, its not needed. When a character is fighting hard mobs, cleave is pretty pointless as well.(maybe its just me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">   ) I do however like the idea of using divine might and shield with a cleric melee build. It has also been my experience that when you have alot of caster levels, spell penetration is not needed. The way I understand it, beating spell resistance takes caster level into account, and this character being primarily a cleric shouldn't have any problems penetrating any SR out there.(if I'm wrong please tell me) I also don't like Armor Skin. If your playing on a PW, most boss creatures are so powerful, it doesn't seem to matter what your AC is... and since your not taking it till level 36 it won't help against the lower powered mobs one kills to xp. I would say take it earlier or not at all. This would leave room to take some metamagic feats such as Empower spell, maximize spell, Spell Focuses and the various stat increasing feats and toughness.<br><br>I'm also a little confused by you skill selection. With a 10 int, clerics and fighters get 2 skills per level, it doesn't seem like you can max out 3 skills, I could be wrong... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   <br><br>I'd give it 6 out of 10 stars as it is. ******<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By bakerkenn on 04/04/04 05:49</span></i></p>

Did you read my notes?  Some of the points you brought up I specifically mentioned in my notes at the bottom.<br><br>Quote:<br>The 10 con seems to low for a build of this type, I would try to reduce you str and cha a touch to get con up to 14.<br><br>In my notes I said:<br>*His HPs are low for a melee character, but Endurance(+40 or 80) and Battlemaster(+160) can give you a nice boost.<br><br>Quotes:<br>It has also been my experience that when you have alot of caster levels, spell penetration is not needed.<br>I also don't like Armor Skin. If your playing on a PW, most boss creatures are so powerful, it doesn't seem to matter what your AC is<br><br>In my notes:<br>Also, the Spell Penetration and Armor Skin feats could be switched out for other feats you desire (Maximize Spell, Epic Prowess, etc.).<br>*Note to above, I'd probably go with Maximize Spell instead of Spell Penetration.  Part of using a build is tweaking it fit your needs - be it for the PW you play on or just your play style.<br><br>Quote:<br>What is the point of taking cleave and greater cleave? It has been my experience that when fighting things that are weak enough to effect with cleave, its not needed. When a character is fighting hard mobs, cleave is pretty pointless as well.(maybe its just me  ) <br><br>At low levels Cleave and Great Cleave give you extra attacks.  Something *every* melee character can use more of.  Against hard mobs at higher levels, you can use your offensive area of effect spells to soften up the mob, then engage them and Great Cleave through them quickly.<br><br>Quote:<br>I'm also a little confused by you skill selection. With a 10 int, clerics and fighters get 2 skills per level, it doesn't seem like you can max out 3 skills, I could be wrong...  <br><br>Have you built many Human characters before?  The benefits to playing a Human is a bonus feat at level 1 and a bonus skill point every level.  So this build will get three skill points every level.<br><br>Whenever I post a build, at the very least I've built it up in the Halls of Advanced Training SoU+HotU module to ensure feats, skills, etc. are feasible at the right levels.
