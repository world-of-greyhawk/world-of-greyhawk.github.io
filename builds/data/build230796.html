My main comment would be the problem with no Uncanny Dodge in the build, which would negate any DEX bonus more often than you might imagine. <br><br>Otherwise both Blind Fight &amp; Toughness would benefit you more being taken pre-epic, freeing up 2 epic feats, and making the build more playable.<br><br>So many points into STR? I Don't see why when you can call on Divine Power to sort that out quite simply. You'd be better off putting them in WIS (more spells and higher Will Save) or CON (more HP and higher Fort Save).<br><br>Drop your starting WIS to 14 and raise INT to 14, then you can max Concentration and Spellcraft.<br><br>Also, you'd benefit from finishing DEX on an even number (ie. 16) rather than the 15 you have, to gain a further point to Reflex Save.<br><br>Looking at the build, it certainly has a more self-buffing melee bent, than a spellcaster and I don't really see the benefit of all the Spell Penetration Feats. Your base Spell DC is very low after all. I would be tempted to drop them all.<br><br>Just some thoughts.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 02/17/06 06:30</span></i></p>

Yes you get 16 con, but human gives you so much more!  NO XP PENALTY = you may reach lv 40  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  !!!  jk<br><br>Also, since you have 3 core classes, human allows you some freedoms in lvl distribution.  See, 25cleric doesnt give you much.  9monk/6ftr gives you an xp penalty (thats the third time i mentioned that.. hmm).  Anyway, goind 23 cleric/9monk/8ftr removes that nasty.  It gives you a useful feat, while maintaining the monk lv.  Oh, you loose 2 con so you end with 14 con (i guess you start with it too! )<br><br>Since blind fight is a bonus ftr feat (as far as i remember) this frees up 3 epic feats.  Opps, epic spell pen isnt really that good for this build, since he has more melee base (4 atts) than caster.  SO you have 3 epic feats to take gr str 5! ending with str 23!  WOOT!  If only we could see past the need to loose a point to dex!  LOL  so that means you have 1 free feat epic, so you could keep toughness, if you wish.  See, sometimes you need to loose epic feats to regular feats, ie makin a non-ftr, dexer wm!   But with 3 cores, you shouldnt really waste those ones.  just my 2 cents there.<br><br>THe other thing is, I understand why you break up the levling early on, but in my vast experience with clerics (virtually all i enjoy playing for 3 years now), you will find the build alot more playable taking cleric to 10 THEN working in monk/ftr like you have.  WHY?  YOu get lv 5 spells asap!  Thats heal, impr invis, etc!  Oh and if you need it, you get +3 gmw, +3 div fav, +3 shield, +3 magic vestment, etc and darkfire!  SO basically, if you are in a world with hard to find magic, you make your own!  You're a cleric  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Hope I helped with my suggestions.  Enjoy the class.  God knows I do.<br><br>Peace

The only other thing that you might consider, is that if you keep your BAB 15 pre-epic, you can take advantage of the Divine Power "bug" (actually, I'm not really sure if it is classified as a bug or not). <br><br>Basically, you would get an extra attack per round at your highest AB. Of course you wouldn't have that extra attack until you cast Divine Power, but it might be worth it considering you are getting so many APR anyway.<br><br>Other than that, it looks good.  With Divine Favor, Darkfire, Battletide, and GMW, you  should be dishing out an insane amount of damage per round. <br><br>Cheers.

So, my attack spells have sucky DC's? if spell penetration doesn't works good I'll be happy to drop them, I thought they would be useful. In that case I suppose I'll arrange the blind-fight and toughnes which are in epic by simply replacing them for the spell penetration feats.<br><br>I chose Dwarf not precisely for the CON but because I can get more initial stats by dropping CHA.<br><br>I thought a lot of time on the INT....... hard desicion, I knew that increasing INT might be suggested........ I'll try it, and see how good or bad it gets, but I suppose you're right, since the WIS point is worth for 2.<br><br>What is the divine power bug? since it's a spell I thought it works with the +12 cap, that's why I raised STR......<br><br>I might keep the class breakdown like that....... I try to get melee feats ASAP, not spells, so, the importance for the monk level to be able to use a kama is of first stance.<br><br>Thanks a lot.

Crap! you mean the tenth attack per round gets as the best AB instead as the worst? sounds good enough to me. But then, it still works with 17 BAB pre-epic, not only 15, since the last APR gets at 18, so 5 fighter levels pre-epic wouldn't give it yet.

A dispel check is d20 + caster level vs. DC 11 + caster level. Not including Mord's, the best check one can get is d20 +15 with a Greater Dispel (which is capped at level 15 as you can see). Ergo, the highest check is 20 +15 = 35; if your caster level +11 &gt; 35 you're immune (that's level 25 and higher <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> ).<br>_________________<br>Fanget av begravelsen<br>pines vi av guds godhet<br>ingen flammer, intet hat<br>de hadde rett vi kom til Helvete... <br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.burzum.org" target="_blank">Burzum</a> - Hvis Lyset Tar Oss

Finneous and I gave him that power, making him a more experienced builder.<br><br>It is indeed ok to build casters with less then 25 lvls, but when you get so close it is probably worth to go for 25 lvls. And indeed there is no such a thing as the perfect build, that's the nice thing about character building.

It would still need a roll of 18...... my chances are not bad.<br><br>I'll keep the playability, at least with this build, for that I coul drop fighter levels to 6 as in the first version, to 5 to still keep EWS, or drop fighter completely, for  maybea Cleric 31 / Monk 9<br><br>LOL, I don't think it's scary..... it's good to learn it I guess..... I didn't knew 35 was the max dispell roll.<br><br>If there was a perfect character it would be very unfair and less fun, but of course no one wants a crappy character.<br><br>Thanks.

Yeah, that's it your chances are still ok, 10% to be dispelled. It's good to be aware of it though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

The human makes Cleric (most lvls) your favord class.  Then monk and fighter must be within 1 lvl or you suffer a penalty.  With dwarf, fighter, yes, is your favord class, but then you have a 23/9 difference = xp penalty.  The difficulty here is that he took 3 core classes.
