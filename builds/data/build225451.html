Inspired by the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225083", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Dragonsinger</a> I decided to build my bard dragon.<br><b>WARNING: If you have issues with xp penalty and/or alignment changes this is not the build for you!</b><br>Alignment changes are necessary in this build (from LN to NN and back) and you'll have an xp penalty in epic. The problems regarding xp penalty and alignment changes can be mitigated with proper lvling (but decreasing one increases the other), I didn't go through the effort of finding the "best" solution regarding this matter, I'll let you figure it out yourself.<br><br>Starting STR and DEX can be a problem, I'm aware of it, but your stats are spread thin. If you feel you can give up a skill lower starting INT to 13 (to preserve access to exp/IE) and CHA to 14, set STR and DEX to 10 and give up Armor skin for Great CHA. Lvl 5 bardic spells will be available later this way.<br>You could also start with STR 8, DEX 8, WIS 18, CHA 14 to get Dragon Shape 3 lvls earlier (33rd lvl). Last two stats bump into CHA to end at 16<br>Preepic feats can be changed to suits one's needs, I took exp/IE for defense and safe casting, zen archery for ranged AB, blind fight for concealed opponents. Epic feats are quite set, armor skin could be swapped for epic prowess.

It looks good.  I like 6 levels of Monk as opposed to my 2 levels.<br><br>But for a few more differences:<br><br>1. AB is not -1, its -4.<br>2. No level 8 druid spells: Premonition<br>3. Getting Lasting Inspiration at level 39.  One of the objectives for Dragonsinger was earliest possible Lasting insp and Dragon Shape.  I choose to get Lasting first since in a party I'd be more helpful with full song buff and then getting more xp/hour then soloing.<br>4. I would agree that I hated opening up the level 5 bard songs  only at 40.<br>5. buffs such as war song and haste last 6 rounds longer.<br><br>Thanks for your build Kail.  I am flattered to have inspired you and I like your changes.

Mine was inspired by the Dragonsinger but it is slightly different and has a different playability also<br><br>Answering your points:<br><br>1. only in human form. Shifted it's -1, sorry WF/EWF don't work in dragon form and I was comparing dragon AB when answering to Finn. If one feels the need for WF/EWF they can be worked in, I went more defensive and got exp/IE and AS.<br>2.yes, but greater stoneskin is not much behind premonition. Sunbeam, sunburst, finger of death and nature's balance are surely missed instead<br>3.I was sorry too about late LS, you can get it in 3 lvls earlier at the cost of delaying dragon form till 39th lvl. Earlier LS is a definite advantage of your build<br>4.You can fix your starting stats for that<br>5.they do, but that amounts to only 15% more, 46 rounds vs 40. I think 40 rounds is enough already, but in prolonged fights you have a slight edge<br><br>I liked to get monk 6 and its boni, but that had a cost. Mainly that was late LS and lvl 8 druid spells.

Aack!  I guess I missed the part that talked about EWF not carrying over to dragon shape!  I was under the impression EWF did. but like you said if it doesn't then drop it!  waste of feat. (I'll have to plug into the leveler mod both versions to check it out)<br><br>The one thing that bugs me is dragons merge armor only.  I will say in my real playing of Dragonsinger curse song decreases the same HP in human and dragon form.  So it seems that may be a bug.  I mention this because I am over 65 perform non shifted, 45 shifted.

I tested witha pure druid and I noticed shifted forms do not benefit from WF/EWF even though the character sheet says so. Do it yourself and check the combat log, and when you check the dragon form remember you've got +6 claws.<br><br>Perform 65 human, 45 dragon but bard song staying the same? Interesting. I'll test it. I believe you have some gloves to raise your perform skill, isn't it?<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail

I do have gloves on that give like +5 perform, but I was under the impression that gloves are not considered armor, so they wont merge.<br><br>I ran some test in the Novice to Epic mod, but I guess I didn't do it right because I forgot to fight mobs, I was going by the character sheet alone.  It did list different numbers though.<br><br>I did 39 druid / 1 monk with the monk level coming in after character level 20.<br><br>With: Weapon Focus, Epic Weapon Focus, Improved Crit, Epic Prowess at level 40:<br><br>AB +48 crit 19 - 20/ x2<br><br>With Epic Prowess at level 40:<br><br>AB +45 crit 20/ x2<br><br>But as I forgot to actually fight something those numbers don't mean squat.  back to the drawing board.
