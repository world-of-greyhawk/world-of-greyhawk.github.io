Okay, I was talking to someone recently who had a seemingly awesome build, he wouldn't divulge all the details but from what I got the build had;<br><br>40 Dex, which means starting at 20 Dex (Elf), increasing Dex every stat increase and 10 post epic Great Dexterity feats, and I'm guessing he had 40 Tumble aswell for that extra AC, probably had Discipline maxed and Spellcraft 40 aswell.<br><br>Dual Wielding Kamas, so I'm guessing WF:Kama, EWF:Kama, Imp' Crit' Kama, Weapon Finesse.<br><br>He casted a few buffing spells, I couldn't tell you which because the particular character I was using had no Spellcraft, and he had lots of attacks per round, so I'm guessing it was Monk/Cleric/CoT.<br><br><br>Could someone try to re-create this build?, I'd try myself but I am hopeless at character building, thanks in advance.

He probably was not a cleric at all, he sounds like a bard, Monk/Bard/Barbarian, Monk/Bard/Fighter or Monk/Bard/CoT. To get a 40 dex you would need a class with great Dexterity as a bonus feat, which suggests Bard (Bard, Harper Scout, Assassin and Arcane Archer are the only classes with great dex as a bonus feat).  <br><br>Was he getting sneak attacks? If so he might have been a Monk/Assassin/X.   <br><br>Are you sure he wasn't counting buffs or items on the 40 dex?  It just is that getting a 20 starting dex, typically means you aren't an uber character.  particularly if you need to have a high casting attribute as well.  If you would like I could hammer out a Monk/Cleric/CoT or Monk/Cleric/Rogue which would be pretty strong, though the Dex would probably only be around 34 or 36.  The latter would have a lower dex, but you could fit in epic dodge.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

I'm pretty sure that he was naked and unbuffed, I don't think he was hitting sneaks but then again that could be a whole new idea.<br><br>Now that you mention it, I recall he had Epic Dodge so the Monk/Cleric/Rogue might be what I'm after, thanks.

He could also be a Monk/Bard/Shadowdancer, although with that it might be strange not to notice HiPSs... and not much use into it.
