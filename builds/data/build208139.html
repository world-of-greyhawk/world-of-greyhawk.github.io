Oh, and be sure to take 8 in Lore for the RDD requirement.<br><br>A few last notes about my thoughts on this build...<br><br>The AB seems low, but I with some cleric buffs you can easily up it by 15 or so.<br><br>Because I found that most Cleric buffing levels stop around spell level 6, I only bothered taking Cleric to 12 pre-epic. I had thought about taking Cleric to only 8 pre-epic and RDD to 8 pre-epic, But I figured that I would need the Improved Invisibilty more than the RDD AC bonuses.  <br><br>I pretty much neglect the Bard spells; only using the Bard levels for the Bard Song and  Tumble, UMD, and Discipline point dumps.  I could have used less Bard levels in this build, but I wanted to make this build as playable from level 1 as possible, therefore the frequent point dumps.<br><br>The Kukri choice was mainly for flavor and the extended  Crit range. Double-Sword would also be a decent choice.  Depending on the environment and available equipment, you could also take the Martial feat instead and go with ShortSwords, Handaxes, etc.  I suppose that If you wanted to try for Dev. Crit, you could use Sickle's as your focused weapon.  <br><br> I found a few similar builds (the closest was cdaulepp's), but they all used a 2-handed weapon and/or had a different build focus.  I've tried it a couple of different ways, but this seems to level the easiest.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 08/14/05 15:20</span></i></p>

This sorta reminds me of my buff disciple, but with cleric spells instead of sorcerer. I like it.

The only thing I see is maybe compeltely forego the exotic weapon aspect and look at using a high damage weapon to take advantage of your strenth such as a greatsword. I say that because I don't see you going for the dev crit factor, and that may allow you some rework to get some extra AB and up your average damage per round.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

But, what I was trying to do with this build, though, is maximize the amount of damage that the Cleric buffs would do per round of combat.<br><br>Here's a quick breakdown.<br><br>Dual Wield Average damage with 3 buffs<br>Main Hand:  2 (weapon) + 13 (darkfire) + 5 (geater magic weapon) + 5 (divine favor) + 10 (strength bonus)  =  35 * 3 (APR) = 105 damage per round<br><br>Off Hand:  2 (weapon) + 13 (darkfire) + 5 (geater magic weapon) + 5 (divine favor) + 5 (strength bonus)  =  30 * 2 (APR) = 60 damage per round<br><br>Total Dual wield damage per round = 165<br><br><br>Greatsword Average damage with 3 buffs<br>7 (weapon) + 13 (darkfire) + 5 (geater magic weapon) + 5 (divine favor) + 15 (strength bonus)  =  45 * 3 (APR) = 135 damage per round<br><br>Total Greatsword damage per round = 135<br><br><br>Granted, it's only 30 per round but sometimes that makes quite a difference in battle. Especially if you only have 3 main hand attacks per round.  Ultimately it would be up to the individual player's style.<br><br>As for the Kukri's, I really only used them for style.  Without any Weapon Master levels, their Crit range probably isn't as important to this build.  A Double-Sword would make more sense in terms  of effeciency since you would only have to buff one weapon instead of 2.  <br><br>If you really wanted to forgo the whole Exotic weapon route, you could drop the Exotic weapon feat as well as the Improved Critical feat and use maces instead. This would allow you to take Power Attack and Cleave - 2 feats which this build could really use.<br><br>In the end, however, I went for kukri's.<br><br>Thanks for the feedback, though.

Don't spells like magic weapon and darkfire only affect your main hand weapon though?

(I'd love to see a detailed analysis of dual-wielding vs. 2-handed weapon with all the variants of strength and extra weapon damage; but I can only imagine what an undertaking that would be, especially considering things like, DR, Damage immunities, Epic Dodge, Concealment and other factors)<br><br>And to be perfectly honest, part of the reason that I  built this as a dual-wielder was to differentiate it from the other builds of this type.  I also find that it's fun to be able to mix and match various weapons with special properties (ie.  one has a strength bonus while another has an AC bonus).  Granted these aren't compelling reason's per se; but it can add a little fun and flavor.<br><br>----------------<br><br>In regards to casting Darkfire/Greater magic weapon on 2 weapons; I usually just cast it once on myself and then hit "I" to bring up the inventory while my toon is still going through the incantations of the first casting, and then I cast it again, directly on the off-hand weapon in my inventory (forgive me if I'm stating the obvious).

Ok, that's what I thought about those spells. I guess if I were to build I would go the greatsword route myself, but I do like the build concept though hence my interest in it.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>
