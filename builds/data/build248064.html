Just trying my hand at an AA build. I wanted high AB, and Uncanny Dodge in the build, so that's why I took Elf and Barbarian. Elf allows me to min/max to start with the 20 DEX, thus getting amost as much DEX as possible in the game. Barbarian provides UD and a bit of extra HPS (as well as 2 uses of Rage for STR and CON boost) while not sacrificing BAB like Rogue would. Bard gives a bit of boost through Song, along with Tumble and UMD. There are only two of these in the guild. Fernandooa's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "198047", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Solid Archer</a> build is quite similar, but the Singing Sniper has higher AB and AC and distributes the feats a little more efficiently IMO. Singing Sniper also has less Bard in order to eliminate the XP penalty that would ensue and also needs less CHA. Anyway, it's different enough to warrant posting, I think.<br><br>Barbarian 5/Bard 6/AA 29<br><br>Elf, any non-Lawful<br><br>Playable from level 1 to 40, PvM<br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 20 (38)<br>CON: 10<br>INT: 12<br>WIS: 8<br>CHA: 12<br><br>1 )BBN1: Weapon Focus:Longbow<br>2 )Bard1<br>3 )Bard2: PBS<br>4 )BBN2: DEX (21)<br>5 )BBN3<br>6 )Bard3: Rapid Shot<br>7 )BBN4<br>8 )AA1: DEX (22)<br>9 )AA2: Called Shot<br>10)AA3<br>11)AA4<br>12)Bard4: Dodge*/ DEX (23)<br>13)AA5<br>14)AA6<br>15)AA7: Mobility*<br>16)AA8: DEX (24)<br>17)Bard5<br>18)AA9: Improved Critical:Longbow<br>19)AA10<br>20)BBN5: DEX (25)<br>   <br>21)AA11: GRT DEX I (26)<br>22)AA12<br>23)AA13<br>24)AA14: GRT DEX II (27)/ EWF:Longbow/ DEX (28)<br>25)AA15<br>26)AA16<br>27)AA17: GRT DEX III (29)<br>28)AA18: Epic Prowess/ DEX (30)<br>29)AA19<br>30)AA20: GRT DEX IV (31)<br>31)AA21<br>32)AA22: GRT DEX V (32)/ DEX (33)<br>33)AA23: GRT DEX VI (34)<br>34)AA24<br>35)AA25<br>36)AA26: Armor Skin/ GRT DEX VIII (36)/ DEX (37)<br>37)Bard6<br>38)AA27<br>39)AA28: GRT DEX VIII (37)<br>40)AA29: DEX (38)<br><br>*Depending how you decide to play (i.e if you don't want to use your bow in melee due to AoOs), you may want to opt for Weapon Finesse and Toughness for these feats.<br><br>BAB: +28<br>AB with mundane weapon: +61/+56/+51/+46<br><br>AC: 34<br><br>HPs: 328<br><br>Saves (vs spells):<br>Fort: 22 (30)<br>Refl: 36 (44)<br>Will: 17 (25)<br><br>Skills (215 points):<br>Spellcraft: 39 (40)<br>Tumble: 40<br>UMD: 39 (40)<br>Perform: 11 (12)<br>Hide: 43 (57)<br>Move: 43 (57)<br><br>I envision this character as strictly a bow user, which is why I opted for Dodge and Mobility.

You miss out discipline totally which makes the really hard to play in many environments. I think you should put points in it especially since you get it as a class skill. <br><br>Personally i dont think the bard spells are worth it ,the duration is to short and they get dispelled very easy, you should consider starting as Barb rasing con to 12 ,int to 14 and leave cha to 8. You would get all the skills you wanted + discipline due to the int boost and 40more hps +1fort save. <br>Going 8 or 9 Barb and only 3 or 2 Bard will also give you +1 BAB and still +1ab from your song.

Just dump Hide and Move and put points into Discipline and either Listen or Spot. However, I don't think Discipline would be any good for this character, since you'd have on;y 40 ranks if you leave your Bard level where it is, or 43 ranks if you take Bard at level 40. 43 ranks isn't worth squat in an environment where Discipline is important. You'd have to take an Epic Skill Focus feat to make it even remotely worthwhile, which would mean giving up some DEX and losing 1 AB and 1 AC. That's not what this build's designed for. <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Personally i dont think the bard spells are worth it ,the duration is to short and they get dispelled very easy, you should consider starting as Barb rasing con to 12 ,int to 14 and leave cha to 8.

I think they're of value, and the duration is 6 hours, which isn't that bad, all things considered. As for dispelling, yes that's a good point, but without 25+ caster levels, you're open to it anyway. HPs are always good, but you can't have everything and an archer really shouldn't need it (or at least, this one shouldn't). If 40 more HPs are going to make a radical difference to this guy, he's already doomed from the outset. It's a viable option if you want to do so though. I find I like having the spells at my disposal though.<br><br>You'll note he starts as Barbarian anyway, btw. <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Going 8 or 9 Barb and only 3 or 2 Bard will also give you +1 BAB and still +1ab from your song.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>And an XP penalty for most of the build's life. Either that, or you switch to 1/2 Elf and lose that +1 AB due to the lowered starting DEX, so it's a wash.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...

I'd change Mobility for Blind-Fight... not that Mobility is not working ok, but I just take Blind-Fight automatically on any non-caster... maybe leaving Toughness instead of Dodge...<br><br>Bardsong level 3 could be very worthy, level 6 only adds skills if my mind serves right (of course, Cinn knows the bardsong much better than I do), Barbarian 8 would give +1 BAB actually, but would leave level 3 song until the very end (non-profitable as palayability I think), and I don't think he needs AB so desperately; he won't get much else from more Barbarian under 9 levels anyway, I respect your choice and it should work pretty much the same either way.<br><br>Nice.

I'll echo Thax, the dodge and mobility don't add much.  I agree with you about discipline not being very useful here.  The whole point of taking barbarian in an archer is to be able to move a bit faster that what ever is chasing you.  Hopefully nothing will be able to get close enough to use a disarm or improved knockdown against you.  Nicely done Cin.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
