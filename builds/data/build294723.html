Probably my last hurrah as far as builds go (although I've some others in my build file that might be tweaked). This is a blatant rip-off of Grizz's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "294459", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Archer Laureate</a>, for which I make no apology. Grizz's build got me thinking about what a good-aligned version of the character might be like, and this is the result. I didn't use Bard, as I'm not a fan of alignment changes, since they cannot be guaranteed in most environments. Oddly, I came up with no builds on the search engine with this combination of classes.<br><br>Anyway, to the build.<br><br><b>Strengths</b><br><br>- Full arcane spells.<br>- good saves (very good vs spells).<br>- decent AB and damage with the bow and a full attack routine.<br><br><b>Weaknesses</b><br><br>- low HPs.<br>- low caster level, so he can be dispelled with ease, and the spells come late.<br>- no UMD, and Tumble is cross-classed, thus his AC isn't stellar either.<br>- feat starvation<br>- narrow skill set<br><br>Despite the weaknesses, this character should be quite playable in a party throughout his career. Until his WIZ levels start building up, he can be played as an archer and should be decent at it. While he can be dispelled, he'll have access to all arcane spells (although one could opt to specialize for an extra casting per level per day) and can use them for defense (mantles, globes, etc.) and use no-save spells like the Bigbys and Isaac's line for offense. As well, scribing will give him more arcane options.<br><br>Overall, I think it's a decent build, although certainly not stellar. Still, get him into a party and I think he'd be a lot of fun.<br><br>PAL 4/WIZ 17/AA 19<br><br>Elf, Lawful Good<br><br>STR 14<br>DEX 14<br>CON 10<br>INT 14 (19)<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 16 (30)<br><br>1 )WIZ1: Point Blank Shot<br>2 )PAL1<br>3 )PAL2: Weapon Focus:Longbow<br>4 )WIZ2: CHA (17)<br>5 )WIZ3<br>6 )WIZ4: Power Attack<br>7 )WIZ5: Still Spell*<br>8 )WIZ6: CHA (18)<br>9 )PAL3: Divine Might<br>10)AA1<br>11)AA2<br>12)AA3: Blind Fight/ CHA (19)<br>13)AA4<br>14)AA5<br>15)AA6: Rapid Shot<br>16)AA7: CHA (20)<br>17)AA8<br>18)PAL4: Divine Shield<br>19)AA9<br>20)AA10: CHA (21)<br><br>21)AA11: GRT CHA I (22)<br>22)WIZ7<br>23)WIZ8<br>24)WIZ9: GRT INT I (15)/INT (16)<br>25)WIZ 10: GRT INT II (17)<br>26)AA12<br>27)AA13: GRT CHA II (23)<br>28)AA14: Epic Weapon Focus:Longbow/ CHA (24)<br>29)AA15<br>30)WIZ11: GRT CHA III (25)<br>31)WIZ12<br>32)WIZ13: CHA (26)<br>33)WIZ14: GRT INT III (18)<br>34)WIZ15: GRT INT IV (19)<br>35)AA16<br>36)AA17: GRT CHA IV (27)/ CHA (28)<br>37)WIZ16<br>38)WIZ17<br>39)AA18: GRT CHA V (29)/ Epic Prowess<br>40)AA19: CHA (30)<br><br>*Choose your poison here.

Wouldnt sorc be better with such a high cha?  as you mention you wont use that many diff spells so more per day is better. Also you could raise dex instead of int And you forgot to add the dmg of div might.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By bloodymerc on 04/04/08 11:10</span></i></p>

Problem is you'd have to take another level to get level 9 spells, which means losing either 1 Pally level (and that means losing either DM or DS) or losing 1 AA level.

Ha!  Leave it to Cin to make a bastardized good version!  I was exploring this avenue at one point, too, and like you the alignment changing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  I actually like this, in much the same way I liked Thax's "Wise-shooter", in which the character is not a kick-arse force of superpowers, but is subtle and can be quite a difference maker if given the chance.  If one really wanted sorcerer instead of wizard, they could always use a half-elf variant and avoid the XP issue, but Level 9 spells would be right out.  I think I prefer the way Cin made it, if only because it is unique and can still hold his own and can still deliver damage that can't be resisted.  <br><br>Well done, laddie, and I hope you enjoyed your romp in the swamp last month. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
