Here is a build that I made a while ago. I have not seen a build like this so my apologies if this has been posted before or someone made something very similar.<br><br>This build focuses on building a "red dragon human", taking in consideration all the benefits that a red dragon has. This build is more on the roleplaying side.<br><br>Human: Chaotic Neutral<br><br>(LvL 40)<br>Strength 14 (30)<br>Dexterity 13<br>Constitution 16 (18)<br>Intelligence 12 (14)<br>Wisdom 10<br>charisma 11 (13)<br><br>The charisma was pushed up to 11 as the sorcerer will gain a maximum of 2 levels of spells and since the +2 to charisma was gained after the sorcerer levels there is little I can do here. I finished the dexterity at 13 since you can only get a maximum of +1 to AC from your Dex. modifier.<br><br>1. Sorcerer, Toughness + Luck of Heroes<br>2. Sorcerer<br>3.

I realize the most you get from DEX is +1 AC, but it wuold boost your Reflex saves by +1 (this is going to be one of your weak saves).<br><br>You'd also get your FTR bonus feats in early (need to shuffle a coule around due to BAB requirements, but you could still get them all in).<br><br>(quote)The feats were based around my ideal of the build and there is little feats to choose from the epic RDD feats list.

Taking GRT CON would also serve to raise your Fort saves as well as gaining HPs. Also, keep in mind that your HPs are still going to be affected by the same amount due to poison or magical effects whether you take GRT CON or Epic Toughness. As an example, if you lose 4 points of CON due to a poison, you're still losing 80 HPs (at level 40) regardless of whether your HPs come from CON bonus or Epic Toughness.<br><br>One last thing I'll say is many people would tell you not to bother going for more than 10 RDD levels, as the benefits are just not borne out by the cost (especially since your breath weapon is only 1 use/day). I tend to agree with this view, but since you stated it's more of a roleplay build, then I'd say it fits in well.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

My advice would be this:<br><br>Go for Constitution and Epic Damage Reduction.  EDR is a bonus feat for RDDs, so you can easily get a 22Con with this build and pick up all 3 EDRs.  This will give you +80 hit points, +2Fort saves, and DR 9/-.  A lot more practical than things like Called shot, Improved Power Attack, etc.<br><br>Also, I believe Epic Prowess is an RDD bonus feat, so there is an instant +1 to your AB.<br><br>I would also drop the Sorceror for Bard.  Taking 4 Bard in pre-epic will give you a +4 to AC, as well as giving you UMD.  It will also raise your BAB by 1, and allow you to get the maximum attack schedule with a +16BAB.  <br><br>Finally, I would suggest dropping Bastard for a 2-hander, like Great Sword and Great Axe.  This will greatly improve the damage you land.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Thank you all for the advice I will take into account what you said and will post a second version of this build as soon as possible.

I forgot to mention that the stats above are wrong here are the correct ones.<br><br>(LvL 40)<br>Strength 14 (32)<br>Dexterity 12<br>Constitution 16 (22)<br>Intelligence 12 (14)<br>Wisdom 10<br>charisma 12 (14)<br><br>These stats are more rounded and better suit the build. My saving throws for fortitude will be higher (thank you for the tips Cinnabar Din and Grizzled_Dwarflord).
