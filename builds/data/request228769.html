I am looking for a halfling assassin dart thrower, focussing heavily on a high death attack dc. <br><br>I want him to be a halfling, for the racial ranged bonus. It has to have epic dodge. <br><br>Was thinking of something like 12 fighter (for ab and weapon spec 2x), 10 sd (for epic dodge) and 18 assassin. But thats just top of mind.<br><br>I have searched for this build but cant find it anywhere.<br>Can you help me out?

Hm, would be better with rogue here. If the SD is for Epic dodge and not for Hips, go Fighter/rogue/asn. split up 10/13/17 perhaps, or better yet 6/13/21. Personally? 6/16/18. High Death attack DC? Then you must have at least close to 30 asn levels.<br><br>As for fighter asn/SD build, the easiest requirements for the fighter to meet is Asn, requiring Hide and MS at 8. You need 13 fighter levels to accomplish that. Your build would end fighter14/SD10/Asn16. Death attack DC would become below 30.

Ok thanks for the info.<br><br>This is a pvp build for pw server. Thats why I choose darts: sick of getting disarmed and having to buy my gear back. Its a lot of team vs team and there are some good tanks on my side and a ranged attacker would complement is nicely.<br><br>Epic dodge is a pvp dream, so it's really a must.<br><br>With so few fighter levels I am a bit worried for the ab. Or doesnt that matter with death attack?<br><br>How does it work? Do you fist have to beat the ac and then make de right DC roll for a succesfull death attack?

You must attack from stealth,invis, at least catch him unaware. If you can do that, then:<br><br>1. Of course you must beat his AC, you make an attack vs his FLAT-FOOTED AC, if you hit, <br>2. he must make a fort save DC=10+Asn lvls+INT modifier.<br><br>You are say 18 asn with 14 int. Death save DC = 10+18+2= 30. A fort save DC 30 for a lvl 40 build? Not too good IMO. And they must be unaware, or else you will just do the sneak damage(death damage!) not make the stunning effect.

Hmmm, ok not so good then. Thanks for the info. Thats a lot of good rolls I have to get before I get anything done. <br><br>The pw I play has lots of pvp and I have been crushing the assassins lately with my bard-archer (3 rogue, 20 bard, 17 AA). But I miss a couple of things:<br><br>- a shield (more AC, more other boosts and enchantments)<br>- epic dodge<br>- SC 5<br><br>So now I am looking for a halfling dart thrower with decent ab, epic dodge and sc 5. <br><br>I guess a fighter rogue will do? Lots of fighter pre epic and 14 rogue post epic for epic dodge?<br><br>Can I take the SC feats on fighter levels too? Is it wise to throw in 5 SD levels for hips and quicker epic dodge?<br><br>I am really starting to like this build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Also fighting under darkness gives you 50% concealment(and constant sneak damage), make sure you have a few other options for giving you concealment using your UMD and you are set. <br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!
