I read this build somewhere, somewhen, but I've made a few mods that make it even better. The idea is to get an AA with dev crit, while not sacrificing the attack and AC bonuses that come with high Dex.<br><br>Elf<br>Str 15 (25)<br>Dex 18 (30)<br>Con 10 (12)<br>Int 12 (14)<br>Wis 8  ( <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"> <br>Cha 12 (14)<br><br>First 5 levels Bard, maxing Lore, Tumble, UMD, Spellcraft, Perform. Take PBS and WF (longbow) and put stat point into STR.<br><br>Then take 4 levels RDD, take Discipline and Spellcraft to 10. Take Rapid Shot + Toughness and put all stats from now on into Dex.<br><br>Next take 10 levels AA, saving skill points. Feats Improved Crit, Power Attack, Cleave.<br><br>Next take another level of Bard, taking Tumble, UMD, Spellcraft and Discipline to 20 and bringing Perform to 18.<br><br>Now take 6 more levels of RDD. Take Epic Weapon Focus, Great Strength I and put skill points into Discipline and Spellcraft.<br><br>Next take 13 levels AA, saving skill points. Feats, Great Cleave, Overwhelming Crit, Dev Crit (both arrive at level 30), Epic Prowess, Great Dex I II III, Armor Skin.<br><br>Final level Bard, taking Tumble, UMD, Spellcraft and Discipline and Perform to 40 and the last two points in Lore.<br><br>Base AC with no armor 34. BAB 27.<br>Attack with plain longbow/arrow: 52/47/42/37<br>Damage 1-8+12 (crit 19-20*3)<br>Attack with +5 Composite Bow/plain arrow 57/52/47/42<br>Damage 1-8+17 (crit 19-20*3)<br>Saves: F24 R33 W21

When reading the message upon inspecting "bardsong" it stats the you need 12 perform AND level 6 for..1 to reflex 1 to skill.<br>The next line is 15 perform AND level 8 for...1 attack and 8 temp hitpoints.<br><br>I tested this out just to make sure and I believe that perform over 12 for a level 6 bard is useless.<br>If you have found a use for it please let me know, you do not get the extra benefits listed wen reading the descriptions of higher level bard songs....maybe you did it for duration or something?<br>With a perform of 44 and charisma of 12...the bard song did not seem to last any longer, and only gave the effects listed for bard level 6 and perform of 12.<br>Something to think about when you add bard to any of your builds i guess.
