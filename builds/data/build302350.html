Before posting this, I decided to look up the word dervish to make sure I was using it right. It turns out I am using it even more right than I had thought. A dervish is a Muslim <i>monk</i> who performs a dance involving a lot of whirling as part of their religious ceremony, hence the phrase "whirling dervish". I guess the name would be even more appropriate if I included Whirlwind Attack.<br><br>The only two builds I could find with similar level distribution are <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "231800", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Monastic Commando (Rogue 19 /Monk 11/ Fighter 10)</a>, which is similar, but not exactly the same, and <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "242230", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Glimmerman (Rogue 19 / Fighter 12 / Monk 9)</a>, which is completely different.<br><br>I made this build specifically with the whole SoU, Nether Scrolls, HotU, Sands of Fate campaign in mind.

What does that 20th level of rogue net you?  Take a monk level instead and you are immune to poison.  All I can see as preferential difference is 4 skill points.<br><br>Edit: Oh yes also a +1 to reflex versus traps, still I don't think it's worth it over poison immunity.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By WhiZard on 10/19/08 17:28</span></i></p>

You have a good point there about monk 11 instead of rogue 20, but in SoF, by the time I would get monk 11, I'd be wearing the Epic Amulet of Health and be immune to poison anyway.<br><br>I take Spot instead of Listen because SoF has a lot of Spot checks in it. I need Persuade in SoF, but even if I don't need to maximize it, what skill would I boost only half way with the points I remove from Persuade? Normally, I put left-over points in Lore, but it's maximized already.<br><br>I didn't base this build on any other. It was only as I prepared to post it that I searched and found something vaguely similar.<br><br>I do have another, more general-purpose build that is similar to this that I call Stealthy Dervish, but it is even more like the Monastic Commando (but still not identical). I promise that I didn't base it on Kail Pendragon's build. It is just a matter of great minds thinking alike. I think I will edit it to reflect your advice about monk 11.
