I would like to make a build that utilizes the blackstaff spell. Would need it to have decent/high ab , dont really care about ac so much since i'll have good defense spells im sure. If WM is in it I think it may have a good chance of having decent damage/ab? Fighter maybe too? Dunno, feedback please!! Thanks! <br><br>P.s. I know this build wont get BStaff until way later in his maturity, it cant be helped, i'd rather sacriface ab and have blackstaff in his late 20's early 30's.

SOR/RDD/WM? I believe I read about a build like this on the boards some time ago. I'll see if I can search out the thread and provide a link.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

Took a while, but I found it: <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=452787&amp;forum=42&amp;highlight=blackstaff" target="_blank">Click Here</a>.<br><br>It's Bard/SOR/WM, so my memory was faulty. ANyhow, I don't know if this will server, as it takes all the SOR levels in epic.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

I thought the dispel from blackstaff was based on caster level. If this is the case, you may be better off with a build that is mostly paladin, relying on his good ab, charisma based saves and holy sword spell. Add a level of shadowdancer and a level of monk post epic for good ac, flurry and HIPS cheeze.

lets stay on topic here. Point of this post is I want to use blackstaff. Doesnt really matter if my saves arent that high , cause they are bound to roll 1's since i can hit them 3 out of the 4 attacks i do pretty much. WM is a sacrifice but it would help my damage tremendously. Any other thoughts anyone?

I recentl had an Idea with this build (ok pure pvp so dont flame the cheese, in PvP cheese=dominance), was going to go Tenser's Transformation with Black Staff, but it wouldnt cooperate. Its very difficult to squeeze the necessary Sorcerer/Wiz lvls to get this spel and still manage an AB to use it. MAYBE if you throw pre-epic Sorcerer out the window and take enough levels in Epic levels it MIGHT work. However, in the purpose i intended it, it is totally useless.<br><br>Anyhow, my idea was something to the tune of 17 Sorcerer Levels, 15 Cleric levels, and I trashed the idea right there. Maybe 5 Paladin Levels? Im not sure. If you can make anything of these scraps, feel free to, but don't cry when the Ranger/Cleric/Monk i spent a whole 20 minutes working out owns this character who took 5hours to plan out. Its a simple game of numbers: Sorcerers aren't meant to melee.<br><br>Good luck and god speed. If you can work this out than god bless ye.
