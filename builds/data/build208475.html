This is what I picked up at first glance <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> :<br>I would start with 16 Strength, 8 Dexterity and 16 Wisdom and substitute the Great Dextrity feats for Great Strengths. And with 6 Charisma, I don't understand what you gain with Strength and War Domains (lasts 3 rounds without equipment or buffs, 9 maximum) - good choices would be Trickery, Travel and Plant. Actually, it seems that you need either Animal or War for Cat's Grace, so they might be worthwhile too.<br><br>Also you forgot to put your level distro in the topic.

The two Great dex feats are Assassin bonus feats, they cannot be switched for strength feats. You should try to raise your strength 1 more point somehow, see if it can be done.

Strength also gives you Stoneskin, which is nice for some protection early in the battle, and Divine Power at a lower level, so you can memorize it more.  And with War domain, you are missing out on the whole point of the domain honestly: <b>Aura of Vitality</b>.  This is one of the most powerful buffing spells in the game.  You and all allies get +4 to STR, CON, and DEX.  Trickery honestly doesn't make much sense, as assassins get invisibility and improved invisibility as 1/day effects.  Travel...well, the only really good spell from that is haste, and in most cases, you'll just have a permahaste item anyway.  As for plant, Creeping Doom is nice, but this build really isn't meant to be an offensive caster.  You could replace Strength with that, but I would definitely not drop War.

Obviously any build has to be adapted to the place you choose play.  But most of my builds, like the Epic Builds on the Bioware page, as designed to be strong naked/mundane equipment as everything else is completely dependent on the place you play.  So, a low magic module is better.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; Trickery honestly doesn't make much sense, as assassins get invisibility and improved invisibility as 1/day effects. </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Some servers have limitations on resting.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>That doesn't justify the redundancy to me, and I don't play on PWs, so it's not generally my concern.  But again, there are always going to be places that are better or worse for a particular build.  This is more of a neutral change, not an improvement, and the individual players who want to use it can make those changes as fitting their worlds.  Anyway, domains tend to mostly be a matter of taste anyway, and can be changed to whatever you like.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; Travel...well, the only really good spell from that is haste, and in most cases, you'll just have a permahaste item anyway. </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Not all worlds give you perma-Haste.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Again, the build is based on what I tend to come across from my experiences.  But, on a truly low magic world, permahaste would be rare too (although perhaps not for a level 40 character).  I could see changing Strength for Travel.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; As for plant, Creeping Doom is nice, but this build really isn't meant to be an offensive caster. </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->There's Barkskin, too.

Every build on the forums has to be tailored to your specific uses, as it isn't possible to create a build that will be good on every server.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 08/14/05 18:01</span></i></p>
