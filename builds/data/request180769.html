I would like to put together a Protector of the woods that is devastating with a bow. I really enjoy druids and would like to combine with the Arcane Archer. I know I want 9th level spells but I'm unsure of the Druid / AA allocation. I especially need help on when to take which class and which feats to take.<br><br>I've looked the the epic build lists and I don't really see this combo - is it a flawed combo?<br><br>Any suggestions would be appreciated.

I don't know that it's necessarily flawed, although I would probably go with Wizard or even Bard rather than Sorcerer.  Generally, Clerics are stronger than Druids when it comes to combat, although Druids can cast a little better.<br><br>When you said you wanted 9th lvl spells, did you mean in Arcane casting, or Divine?  I'd probably go for 9th lvl Arcane spells, but it's really up to you.  <br><br>You may want to check out my Mystic Archer build; it's not an incredibly devastating archer, but's it's decent, and it cast cast quite well.  If you wanted Enchant Arrows +5 (which you probably would), you might want to do something like Wizard 20/Druid 11/AA 9.  <br><br>You can easily change this build to suit your liking by trading off Wizard levels for Druid or AA levels; for example, by doing Wizard 15/Druid 12/AA 13, or Wizard 10/Druid 17/AA 13, or whatever you want really. <br><br> The advantage of Bard over Wizard is that you would be able to max Discipline and Tumble, which makes you more resistant to Knockdown and Disarm and gives you higher AC.  You would also get Bard Song, which boosts damage, AB, AC, and even your skills.  You also get a better BAB progression and slightly more health.  <br><br>The advantages of Wizard are more powerful spellcasting, bonus feats every five levels, and the fact that you need Int rather than Cha, which is almost useless to the build except for the fact that Bards need it to cast spells.  Int, on the other hand, is useful to every build as more Int means more skill points.
