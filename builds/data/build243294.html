The Gothic Berserker <br>by Deborah "Tyr"<br><br><b>The Gothic Berserker is playable level 1-40 PvM/single-player, but every good bard is welcome in PvP, too.</b><br><br>Concept: Goths (known to Rome as "civilized beserkers"), were fiercely loyal to their King, of Norse-mix beliefs, and thought to originate from Scandinavia (immigrating from Scot-Denmark/Scandza/Icelandia). They settled the Rhine, and eastward, constantly battling the Romans (whom they eventually defeated). <br><br>This character is based somewhat on Jormunrek of the Volsungasaga, the King of Goths, and also Volker of Alzei, "who was a vassal to Burgundian princes. Volker was exceptional warrior, . . . (and) knew how to play the fiddle, so he was nicknamed the Minstrel or the Fiddler."

Note: Just thought I'd mention, in terms of the classes chosen, that this would seem to be the very first one of its kind. A new breed of hero, so to speak, although based on timeless legends.<br><br>Special thanks are in order, and especially to Mith, for some helpful info in regards to a different character I designed, but which was nevertheless pertinent (and very much appreciated). As always! <br><br>I look forward to all of your great thoughts, comments, etc., and do hope you enjoy this character (and the Norse history lesson). <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Robert Tyr on 06/08/06 19:05</span></i></p>

Hey, Finn: good to see you! Ask, and you shall receive.... LOL<br><br>Seriously, was supposed to be 14, but since I needed to make an edit anyway, and on great advice from Sir Kail on this, it's up to 15. No boosts, no items, no buffs nor anything else; all shiny and clean, with full spell access, as a "civilized beserker" should be, and optimizing thus the bard (another version optimizes barbarian <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>(Mith, Kail, do take a bow guys, and you, too, Finn, the learning is just so good here <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
