This is my first attempt at a Cleric build.  I'm still learning about this class, so I'm happy to hear any criticisms.  It was a tough choice between Monk/Rogue, CoT/Fighter.  In the end, I didn't want any XP penalties, so I went with CoT, and I wanted UMD &amp; Tumble, so Rogue it was.<br><br>This character is intended to be a Melee Cleric who can also sling a good number of spells around. Buff spells are the focus, crowd softeners second, and the occasional Harm, Destruction and Slay Living for added fun. <br><br>This Cleric should be welcome in any non-evil party, no matter the class composition. Turn Undead isn’t that important because you can just bash them or hit them with other spells. Therefore, Charisma is kept at 10 (except for buffs).

Ok, with your advice in mind, here's another draft.  I had to make a choice between Persuade, Search, Disable/Set Traps.  I decided any situation that I could set traps I could just bash things, and I could use summons or my tankness to disable traps.
