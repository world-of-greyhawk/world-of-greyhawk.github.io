Greetings,<br><br>  This is my first ever build and if there are other builds out there similar to this I sincerely appologize.<br><br><br>The PW I play on is high magic with alot of monsters that have slay.  The purpose of my build is to have a character that has decent damage and also HP and damage reduction.  I'm still relatively a noob to NWN but have been reading forums for a while and tried making this build.  Any suggestions or input would be greatly appreciated.  Also a question I had, after looking at the build would I be better off taking another lvl of WM and only take 1 lvl of rogue?  Please help me and don't be kind in your critiques.  Like I said, this is my first build but greatly appreciate input.<br><br><br>Just came up with this and tested it. However I ended up with only 22 in pick lock. If I dropped my disc to 20 , I could get 32 open lock for final stats of <br><br>43 Tumble <br>43 UMB <br>32 Open Lock <br>20 Disc <br><br>But here is the build, your input would be so greatly appreciated and any new idea's or suggestions. <br><br>Dwarf - True Neutral <br><br>Starting Stats <br><br>16 <br>13 <br>18 <br>8 <br>13 <br>6 <br><br><br>Fighter 1-9 <br><br>1.

Nothing <br>39. 10 Discipline ** Armor Skin, Epic Reflexes <br><br>Rogue Lvl 40 <br><br>40. Max Tumble, Max UMB, Open lock is 22 Evasion <br><br><br>Here is the build I made and tested, it seems to work ok. I didn't know what damage reduction really did and it does 9 damage reduction a hit. So do I stick with damage reduction or do i go with epic toughness and gain 60 HP? Also the reason I put 1 intelligence at lvl 36 was to gain more skill points to finish up with. And if I sacrifice 10 Discipline at lvl 39 I can add 10 to my open lock skill at 40. The reasons for high open locks it the PW I play has numerous area's that require open locks and non-bashable.<br><br><br>Thanks,<br>Christian<br><br>***  Just thought of possible responses to this post. Some may suggest to get better damage reduction is to go DD, but on the PW I play I'd rather stay neutral to take advantage of playing both good and evil.  Also I've always played Human's, so want to try a dwarf out.  (the dwarf got the extra 2 con at the start and it worked with this build but open to suggestions)  <br><br>Once again thanks and any input is appreciated.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ChristianJock007 on 05/11/04 00:54</span></i></p>
