Can anyone recommend a build for a pure paladin?  Strength based.  I am most concerned with the first 30 levels, since that is the level limit in my PW. <br><br>Thanks.

Hiya.<br><br>I've never played a paladin so can't help you too much. But here's a strength-based Paladin/CoT/Fighter that you could use as a template. If I were to try a paladin one day, it would probably be using this build (or something similar to it).<br><br>I know you asked for a pure pally, but here's all I could find right now.<br><br>Kaliban<br><br>::: ::: ::: ::: ::: :::<br><b>Paladin/CoT/Fighter</b><i> by Darth Baenre </i><br><br> <br>Here's a Paladin I recently tested out who works up his Strength for Devastating Critical and a high AB, but still winds up with a decent Charisma in the end. Moreover, I actually built him in a way that can get him saving throws almost as good as a CHA-heavy Great-Smiting Paladin. This Paladin is a solid character and should please both STR- and CHA-build adherents.<br><br>I gave him 4 levels of Fighter for the WS and EWS feats. Since Paladins of Torm are allowed to multiclass freely with Fighter under the FRCS, it's a sound build RP-wise, as well.<br><br>Human Paladin 26/Champion of Torm 10/Fighter 4<br><br>Starting stats:<br><br>STR 15<br>DEX 10<br>CON 14<br>INT 10<br>WIS 14<br>CHA 14<br><br>Skills: Discipline is a must and should be maxed. After that, your call. I like Tumble and Taunt. Persuade for conversation-heavy modules.<br><br>Pre-epic progression:<br><br>All 5 ability increases in STR.<br><br>1-7) Paladin 1-7: Power Attack, Cleave, Weapon Focus (longsword), Divine Might<br>8 ) CoT 1<br>9) Paladin 8: Extra Turning<br>10-13) CoT 2-5: Great Cleave, Improved Critical (longsword), *Blind-Fight<br>14-20) Paladin 9-15: Divine Shield, Extra Smiting<br><br>Epic Progression:<br>21) Fighter 1: Epic Weapon Focus (longsword), Great Strength I (STR 21)<br>22) Fighter 2: Epic Prowess<br>23-24) Fighter 3-4: Weapon Specialization (longsword), STR +1, Great Strength II (STR 23)<br>25-27) CoT 6-8: Epic Weapon Specialization (longsword), Overwhelming Critical, Great Strength III (STR 24)<br>28) CoT 9: STR +1 (STR 25)<br>29) CoT 10: Devastating Critical (longsword)<br>30-40) Paladin 15-26: Great Charisma I, CHA +3, all 3 Epic saving throw feats, Armor Skin, *Epic Reputation (to help with Taunting)<br><br>* - feats can be replaced with something else if desired.<br><br>Final Stats:<br><br>STR 25<br>DEX 10<br>CON 14<br>INT 10<br>WIS 14<br>CHA 18<br><br>With ability-enhancing items I can get STR to 37 and CHA to 30, resulting in a respectable AB, a Dev Crit DC of 43, and enough CHA to still make the Paladin abilties and saving throw increases more than worthwhile. I still get 3 Smite Evil uses for a little extra *oomph* when needed, and I pretty much have all the feats I could possibly need, or want. After much fiddling with this build, I actually found myself having to take 5 pre-epic CoT levels because I didn't want to waste Epic feats on useless stuff like Epic Toughness and figured that stuff like Blind-Fight would be more useful early on.<br><br>With the Epic save feats, CHA enhanced to 30, and CON enhanced to 24 w/ Boots of Striding +10, my Fortitude save was 49, which will resist the Dev Crit of pretty much all Weapon Master builds one may care to throw at me. About the only thing that has a remote chance of Dev Critting me is a min-maxed Bard/RDD/Fighter. But when I face one of those, that's when a Ring of Fortitude +10 comes in handy.<br><br>Edited By Darth Baenre on 02/15/04 15:52:57<br>_________________<br>Check out the Epic Character Builders Guild<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Test your new builds in this mod:<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/modules/data/1073117317280.shtml" target="_blank">Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kaliban99 on 01/08/05 01:21</span></i></p>
