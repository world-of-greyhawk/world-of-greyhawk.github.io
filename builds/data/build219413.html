<i>Yes, it goes without saying that I've been too long at my cups.  If I were to play a pointy-ear, it would go something like this:</i><br><br>Perhaps the first of her kind, this Dwarf-blooded Elf can stand in the thick of battle and ram arrows down people's throats.  Her Hit Points and Damage Reduction are legendary.  Even with no items, she can land Called Shots made at 50 AB.  Combined with hefty damage output, rock hard saves, and a great skill set, she becomes a PvM machine.  This is one Archer that doesn't stand from a distance to win a battle.  <br><br><br><b>The Iron Archer</b><br>Fighter14<br>Bard4<br>Arcane Archer22<br><br><i>Playable 1-40, PvM Extreme</i><br>Note: Build incurs XP Penalty from 7th level and beyond<br>Race: Elf<br>Alignment: Any non-lawful<br><br><b>Attributes</b><br>Str12<br>Int14<br>Wis8<br>Dex18 (26)<br>Con14 (22)<br>Chr8<br><br><b>Leveling Guide</b><br>1 Fighter1, Weapon Finesse, Pointblank Shot<br>2 Fighter2, Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>3 Fighter3, Rapid Shot<br>4 Fighter4, Weapon Specialization: Longbow, Dex19<br>5 Fighter5<br>6 Fighter6, Called Shot, Blindfighting<br>7 Bard1<br>8 Archer1, Dex20<br>9 Archer2, Improved Crit: Longbow<br>10 Archer3<br>11 Archer4<br>12 Archer5, Dodge, Con15<br>13 Archer6<br>14 Archer7<br>15 Fighter7, Mobility<br>16 Fighter8, Spring Attack, Con16<br>17 Bard2<br>18 Archer8, Toughness<br>19 Archer9<br>20 Archer10, Con17<br>21 Archer11, Great Con I<br>22 Archer12<br>23 Archer13<br>24 Archer14, Epic WF, Great Con II, Con20<br>25 Archer15<br>26 Archer16<br>27 Bard3, Great Dex I<br>28 Archer17, Con21<br>29 Fighter9<br>30 Fighter10, Epic Damage Reduction I, Epic WS: Longbow<br>31 Archer18, Epic Prowess<br>32 Archer19 Con22<br>33 Fighter11, Great Dex II<br>34 Fighter12, Epic Damage Reduction II<br>35 Archer20<br>36 Archer21, Great Dex III, Dex24<br>37 Bard4<br>38 Fighter13<br>39 Fighter14, Epic Damage Reduction III, Armor Skin<br>40 Archer22, Great Dex IV, Dex26<br><br><b>Combat Vitals</b><br>AC in Mundane Padded or Plate: 29(30)<br>Longbow AB: 52/47/42/37(19-20/x3)<br>Rapid Shot/ Hasted: 50/45/40/35/50/50<br>Base Damage: 1-8+6+11=18-25(54-75 on crit)<br>Finesse AB: 38<br>Back-up Weapon: Mace or Light Hammer<br>HP: 620<br>Skill Points: 224<br>Damage Reduction: 9/-<br><br><b>Saving Throws</b><br>Reflex: 30 (38)<br>Fort: 29 (37)<br>Will: 17 (27)<br><br><b>Skill Set</b><br>Tumble: 40<br>Discipline: 42 (43)<br>UMD: 36 (35)<br>Perform: 10 (9)<br>Heal: 6 (5)<br>Spellcraft: 38 (40)<br>Listen: 43 (44)<br>Lore: 1 (3)<br>Open Lock: 1 (9)<br>Disable Trap: 1(3)<br>Persuade: 6 (5)<br><br><b>The Iron Archer's Arsenal</b><br><br>--AB for Point Blank Called Shot w/BardSong: <b>50</b><br>--Base Critical for PBS w/BardSong: 63-84<br>--Seeker Arrow (2x a day): Arrow Cannot Miss<br>--Hail of Arrows (1x a day): up to 22 targets at once<br>--Arrow of Death: Opponent Save or Die<br>--Enchant Arrow XI:  Arrows fire at +11Bonus to hit/damage<br>--Extremely High Hit Points<br>--Epic Damage Reduction<br>--Versatile Skill Set<br>--BardSong: +1AB, +2Dam, +1Will, +1Fort<br>--Keen Senses<br>--High Saves<br>______<br><br><b>Players Guide to the Iron Archer</b><br><br>1.	<b>XP Penalty:</b> For many people this is not an issue.  But take the 20% into consideration if you are playing in a PW where every goblin counts.<br>2.	<b>Wear Plate:</b>  At some point you can wear padded and still have the same AC, but wear heavy armor until then.  Spring Attack is taken because of this to mitigate Attacks of Opportunity as you bounce around in combat.<br>3.	<b>Called Shot:</b>  when you’re up against a tough enemy, this is your bread and butter—particularly Called Shot: Leg.  You can have them literally crawling on the floor begging for death.<br>4.	<b>UMD:</b>  Don’t forget to max out your UMD skill on Bard level-ups.  Allowing this character to cast from any scroll in the game without failure, plus most items, is almost criminal.  You can win many a tough battle with this skill alone.<br>5.	<b>Don’t forget your Rapid Shot Mode:</b>  This gives you an extra attack per round.  Albeit all your attacks are made at 2 lower AB, but, unlike a monk, you can easily afford a –2AB.<br>6.	<b>Piercing Immune:</b> If you come across these types, use arrows that have elemental damage.  Also, you have Weapon Finesse, so you can also keep a mace/light hammer quick slotted with a shield.<br>7.	<b>Mighty Bows:</b>  Look for Bows that confer the <i>Mighty </i> property.  It allows you to add strength damage to your bow attacks.  Couple this with some strength-boosting apparel and you will be quite formidable.<br>8.	<b>You can take a hit:</b> Particularly in Epic Levels, you’ll have as many hit points as many front line warriors.<br><br><br>****tale con't from <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "218824", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Last Great Bounty Hunter</a> ****<br><br><br><br>"Blast!"  <br><br>I attempted to wipe the lens of the spyglass with my wet and muddied cloak.  The thing was fogged up from the inside.  I looked up at the grey sky above me.  Bloody rain.  This marks the fifth straight day of steady rain.<br><br>I hate rain.<br><br>"What is it now, Dwarf?" the Elf asked.<br>"Bloody gnome ingenuity, that's what!" I said sourly.<br>"Were you able to see anything?"<br>"Aye, " I snorted.  "They're half a league out.  Moving slowly, too.  Just one wagon.  A lone driver—“<br>“That would be the priest,” the calimshite muttered.<br>“Aye,” I said.  “The priest of ‘significance.’” And I gave the she-elf  a sideways glance.  She still looked straight ahead, but I could see the corners of her lips curl into a wry smile.<br>“And,” I continued, “A score of men on horseback.  There’s also someone in the back of the wagon, but this blasted lens—“<br>“That would be him—the Hearth Guard,” the she-elf said.<br>I rolled over onto one elbow and gave her a look.<br>“Alright, you won’t tell us what’s in the chest.  You won’t tell us who our employers are.  You won’t tell us why were doing this—“<br>“I’m doing it for the gold,” the calimshite interrupted.<br>“Shut-up,” I said, and continued.  “At least tell me this: are we the good guys or the bad guys?<br><br>And there was a silence, and all eyes fixed on the she-elf, until finally she turned and looked at me.<br><br>“Since when is the so-called Great Bounty Hunter concerned about morals?”<br>“Since, for the first time ever, he has a bad feeling about a commission, and needs something more to go on than just coin,” I stated fuming.  “Now tell me!”<br>“It remains to be seen,” she replied dryly, “On whether we get that chest or not.”  <br><br>I hate Elves.<br><br>We lay prone upon a hilltop that overlooked the rocky road below.  The land was rugged, and where once a small gully sliced across the road was now a river, swift and deep, and twould be a treacherous ford for even the stoutest horse and wagon.  I was actually beginning to think that, ambush aside, these fellows would never get across the river.  The flood carried away eastward into the wild where it most likely fed into the River Reaching, which in turn flowed into the Chionthar River, a lifeblood for such cities as Scornubel, Elturel, and Baldur’s Gate, where it finally found its way into the Sea of Swords and beyond.<br><br>We lay there upon the hill.  So smeared in mud and wet foliage that we were indistinguishable from the landscape.  Even our faces were painted with mud, like aboriginal warriors from a time forgotten.  I looked upon each member of the team.  They were all capable enough.  There was the strong calimshite—whom I’ve been meaning to ask about that job in Baldur’s Gate.  How did he get out of that double cross?  And there were the stocky twin brothers, Amnish rogues, Ceyzar and Uthzar.  Ceyzar carried a pair of hatchets, while his brother always had a finger on the trigger of a rather large and sophisticated crossbow.  And there was Carver, the thin one who sat beside me at the Black Lion who was ready to plunge a knife in my chest.  He was talented, but young.  He had a way of disappearing right before your eyes.  And for whatever reason, he clung to every word and look the she-elf gave him.  Still, he was a good lad and very respectful-- always calling me "sir," and "lord."  <br><br>And there was her, of course.  She was sure and capable, that was bloody well clear, but she was cold and aloof.  Though it was difficult to see beneath the earthy muck, she wore a clever patchwork of plate and chain, and a great bow was slung across her back.  A number of quivers, each brimming with black-feathered shafts, were strapped to her hips.  During our journey here, Carver mentioned that she was a "dead shot" with a bow.  He said something about her bringing down a rogue bull elephant.  He said it had grabbed her with its trunk and tossed her like a rag doll against a stone wall.  She calmly got up, brushed herself off, and put an arrow through its eye.  Pierced its brain, dead.  <br><br>Likely story, I said.<br><br>"Let's go over the plan one more time," I stated.  "When the wagon's wheels are in the water, the calimshite will emerge from the patch of vegetation, there, by the river.  You will keep the knights busy, and keep their focus on you.  Take out as many horses as you can, but don't kill the knights.  Uthzar, you cover him from here with your crossbow.  Make sure he doesn't get overwhelmed.  During this time, Carver will appear and disable the priest.  Make sure you time it just as the calimshite comes out.  It's imperative that the priest is disabled, Carver.  If he gets any of his hocus pocus going, we all could be in trouble."<br>"Yes, sir," he nodded.<br>"Ceyzar, you and I will already be down there, concealed beneath the mud and water.  I'm going to hit that Hearth Guard hard and fast.  He's going to be off balance for just a few seconds.  You  will grab the chest and sprint the distance back up this slope.  The she-elf will--"<br><br>"Dorian," she interrupted.<br>"What?"<br>"My name is Dorian, not "she-elf."<br>"Aye," I wiped the raindrops from my brow.  "<i>Dorian</i> will--"<br>"You never gave us your name," she said flatly.<br>"I know," I growled through my wet beard.  "Let's keep it that way.  Dorian will insure that Ceyzar is not pursued." And then I paused and spoke gravely.  "You must not let anyone get close to him.  You are the only one who can defend him at this point.  Our success, our lives, depends on the strength of your bow."<br>"Aye," she nodded.  "My aim will not fail."<br><br>"The rest of you," I continued, " need to disengage at this point and follow Ceyzar.  Make your way up this trail above us.  Remember, the trail is booby-trapped all the way up.  Remember where each one is, and take your time.  If any are still in pursuit at this point, they won't be for much longer.  Questions?"<br>Everyone was silent.<br>"Should anything go wrong, or we get separated, we meet in 5 days in Iriaebor, at an inn called The Rook.  Let's get into position."<br><br>And as we dispersed from the hillside I felt a hand grip my arm.  I looked up and saw the she-elf, and she searched my eyes for a moment.  For the first time I saw doubt in hers.  <br>"What is it?" I asked.<br>"I-- I just want to let you know that I have your back."<br>I cocked my head to one side and said, "Is there something you want to tell me?"<br>She was thoughtful for a moment, then said,  "We're the good guys." <br><br>I watched her turn and head for her position.  She was beginning to earn my trust.  But why did she feel she needed it?  Did she think me capable of a double-cross?  Or was there something else....someone else?<br><br>I pushed the idea to the back of my mind as Ceyzar and I began the slow low-crawl to the river's edge.  We found the spot where they would most likely attempt a ford.  We concealed ourselves completely in the mud and fauna at the bank.  I saw the calimshite and Uthzar do the same about 40 yards upstream.  I saw the she-elf dip behind the outcrop of rocks on the hill that overlooked the road.  And Carver-- well, I just didn't see him at all.  He was that good.<br><br>And so we waited, in the rain, in the muck, in the cold wet air.  Thirty, forty, fifty minutes went by.  My muscles were getting stiff.  I tried to wiggle my toes.  I couldn't tell if they moved or not.  I heard a muffled grunt come from the direction of Uthzar and the calimshite.  They were probably getting impatient.<br><br>And then I heard the jingle of harness and the stamp of hooves.  They were here.  I could see the wagon, pulled by a team of two horses, stop just short of the water's edge.  Heavily armored knights milled around on horseback, their steeds neighing nervously.  And then the priest, dressed in flowing white robes, stood up.  Just over his shoulder, in the back of the wagon, I saw a large gray-bearded dwarf standing stoically with both hands gripped around a maul.<br><br>"This is the place," the priest yelled.  And I watched the twenty knights, in coordinated unison, pull forth heavy crossbows, locked and loaded.<br><br><i>What the--</i><br><br>And I saw the calimshite erupt from the bushes with a black tulwar in one hand, and some object in the other.  He gave it a mighty toss and I watched it sail through the air and land near the wagon and roll to where Ceyzar and I were concealed.  It was the severed head of Uthzar!  And in that moment a flood of memories assailed me. Memories about the failed Baldur’s Gate job.  Now I knew the reason how he lived when I saw him fall that fateful night three years ago.  He had betrayed us!  And now he has done so again.<br><br>And the calimshite roared to the priest, "To your right!"<br><br>The priest made a sign in the air, and there was a flash of light, and Carver suddenly appeared next to the wagon, daggers in hand.  He stood in wide-eyed amazement as I heard the sound of twenty clicks followed by twenty bolts thud into his chest and back.  He fell to the earth, his eyes still wide in amazement.<br><br>"It's a trap, Ceyzar, run!" I yelled, but he was already up and running.  But he wasn't trying to escape; he was heading straight at the calimshite, a hatchet in each hand.<br><br>"You bastard!" he cried.  And I heard the clash of steel, but I didn't have time to follow the contest.  I had more immediate concerns.<br><br>The priest stood tall in the wagon, his arms akimbo, his eyes ablaze with a feral light, and he turned and looked right into my eyes.  <br><br><i>Move you bloody idiot</i>! I screamed to myself.  I dove into the water just as a pillar of flame roared from the clouds above and scorched the earth where I had lain.  In the next instant I erupted from the water, like a demon, and in a burst of speed closed on the priest.  As I ran I could feel the clatter of bolts as they pelted against my armor like rain.  And as the priest raised his arms again into the air, I sprang from my feet and leapt into the air, dropping a heavy shoulder against the priest's chest.  He grunted as he was knocked from his wagon perch and onto the muddy ground below.  As he struggled to get up, I quickly surveyed the situation.<br><br>Half the knights had circled around Ceyzar who was still battling against the calimshite.  Ceyzar was fighting for his life at this point, and he bled from a dozen different wounds.  The rest of the knights were circling around me, each with broadsword and shield.  The Hearth Guard eyed me coldly from the bed of the wagon, but he didn't move.  At his feet I saw the iron bound chest.  The priest was getting up.  The knights were closing.  I had about a split second to make a decision, and---<br><br>--And then I saw a figure loping down the hill-- the she-elf!  And a score of arrows darkened the sky and I watched, dumbfounded, as each one sprouted in the throat of a knight.  <br><br>"Get this wagon out of here!" the priest yelled to the Hearth Guard.  And the priest again had his hands in the air and a black energy swirled about his visage.  And then a black-feathered shaft pierced his left palm, and he clutched it to his side in pain.  As the second arrow pierced his other hand, he dropped to his knees and cried, "No!"<br><br>Four more arrows sprouted from his torso, like some grisly bouquet, and he fell face first into the mud.  <br><br>And then from nowhere sprang the Hearth Guard, and with one blow he sent me flying off the wagon.  It took me a moment to catch my senses, and when I did I realized that I clung between the necks of the horses.  They were immediately aware of me, and they each snorted and jumped into the river.  The wagon lurched forward, and I gripped desperately to the necks of the beasts to keep from falling into the rushing water.  But the Hearth Guard had the reins, and he attempted to bring the horses under control.  He reined them hard to the left, and as they turned the wagon bogged down into the mud and sediment.  But the horses, with a surge of adrenaline, pulled themselves free of the river-- and then I heard the splinter and snap of timber.  Both the hitch that secured the horses and the wagon's axles ripped apart from the competing force of the horses against the flooding water and mud.  And I watched the wagon, wheelless and horseless, begin to float away down the stream, while the Hearth Guard stood at its fore with his mouth agape.<br><br>And with a cry I leaped from the horses and was able to just grasp the edge of the wagon.  I pulled myself into the wagon's bed as it drifted wildly and out of control.  It spun madly about, and it was all I could do to stay on my feet.  The Hearth Guard whirled around with his maul in hand.  I reached for my axe and--<br><br>My axe was gone!<br><br>And he came with maul upraised and I braced for the blow.  But the wagon slammed into a rock, and the Hearth Guard stumbled and was forced to drop his weapon.  And then I pounced.  I dropped a shoulder and hit him with enough force to daze a bull.  But he only grunted, and then slammed a fist into my nose and everything turned red.<br><br>And there we were, Dwarf against Dwarf, fist against fist, in the pouring rain, on a wheelless wagon careening out of control down the brown waters of a rapid river.  And we battled like titans for what seemed like hours but I know were only minutes.  He was getting the best of me, as I knew he would, and with his mighty pounding fists I was brought to my knees.  Blood streamed down my face, my eyes were nearly swollen shut, my nose was sideways, and I struggled to spit broken teeth from my mouth.   He loomed above me, and with one hand he gripped me by my hair, and his other hand was cocked back to his ear.<br>"Nothing personal," he said.  I stared defiantly back.  <br><br>Then, a blur of movement caught the corner of my bloody eye.  There! Upon the riverbank!  A large black warhorse thundered, and in its saddle rode the she-elf!  And she held her great bow in hand with an arrow nocked and aimed while the horse galloped at full speed.  The Hearth Guard saw my glance and looked up just as an arrow ripped through the forearm that gripped my hair.  <br><br>He actually grunted in pain and I felt his grip release.  A second arrow pierced his other forearm, and a third arrow sprouted from his hamstring in the back of his leg.  He stumbled and went down to one knee.  I summoned my last remaining strength and slammed against him.  He stumbled backwards through the wagon, and teetered on one foot near the wagon's edge for just a moment.<br>"Nothing personal," I gritted, and a fourth arrow struck his kneecap, and he fell backwards into the brown torrent of the floodwater and disappeared.<br><br>I looked to the riverbank and saw the elf still keeping pace with the flood-driven raft.<br>"Throw me the chest!" she yelled to be heard above the galloping hooves and the roar of the river.  I grabbed the chest, judged its weight, and knew immediately.<br>"It'll never make it!" I cried.  <br><br>And then I heard a roar rise above that of the river.  I turned and looked down stream.  I saw where the raging rapids fell away into nothingness.<br><br><i>You've got to be kidding me</i>, I thought.  Judging the distance and the speed of the wagon flotsam, I had about twenty seconds before I would be swept over the edge.  I looked back to the elf.  She had another arrow nocked and brought her bow down, aimed right at me!<br><br>"Bloody Hell!" I muttered, and in dumbfounded slow motion I watched her arrow fly from the string and slice through the air, spinning, turning, cutting through the rain drops.  But something trailed behind it-- a rope?<br><br>And I felt a thud and shudder as it sank deep into the chest that I still held in my hands.<br>"Don't let go!" she cried, though I could barely hear her.  And I saw her fingers race to secure the other end of the rope around her arm.<br><br>And then everything fell away and I felt myself floating in the air, and there was water all about me, and then I couldn't breathe, and I felt myself sinking, sinking, sinking, and all was dark.  And in my mind I could still hear the she-elf saying, "Don't let go, don't let go."   I felt something tugging on me, pulling me, dragging me, something trying to get the chest-- but I didn't let go.  "Don't let go," she had said to me, "Don't bloody let go!"<br><br>And then I saw light and felt fresh air, and my lungs gasped for a gulp of it, and a pressure in my stomach exploded and I vomited all over the ground.  I rolled over on my hands and knees and just lay there as water and blood drained from my mouth and nose.<br><br>Then I saw her hand grasp my wrist, and she slung my arm over her shoulder and hoisted me to my feet.<br><br>"I thought I lost you," she said.<br>"You--you--," I labored to breathe, "you came over the Falls with me?"<br>"Aye," she said.<br><br>I looked up.  The height dizzied me.  The waterfall poured from the high plain above, a good 200 feet away.  I should have died.  How she did not escapes me to this day.  But then I remembered Carver's story about the bull elephant.  How it had picked her up and slammed her against a stone wall.  How she calmly got up and put an arrow in its brain.  I didn't believe the story.  But now this?  Nobody would believe this.<br><br>We studied each other for a moment, and then I mustered up the best smile my swollen-eyed, sideways nose, lip-shredded, craggy face could muster, and said, "It's time you told me what's in the chest."<br><br>And she flashed me a rare smile.  "Aye," she said.<br><br>****<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/12/07 16:04</span></i></p>

YES! Nice AA build, an archer with also nice damage. Huge style points for 22 CON and EDR 3, in an ELF!<br><br>Highly unusual, thats what makes it truly good.<br><br>And your continuing story is heading for the epic levels to I see. Easily readable all the way, PvC(Player vs Computer).<br><br>Even an elf you must give Dwarf blood. Very good.<br><br>Now, when will another Norse hero be due from you, I wonder?

Very nice build, but an even better story.  The ranged AB is less than the "average" epic AA but is still better than anyone else would get.  +11 arrows for punching DR would make pretty much any foe wish he'd slept in that day.<br><br>Not having uncanny dodge is a shame, but the DR and extra hitpoints provide a very good defense and you can still wear armor even when your dex catches up to plate's AC bonus if you want.  It's a good degree of that 'operational flexibility' that's come up before - if you find a really neat suit of medium or light armor with side bonuses that benefit you, you can change into it without much loss of AC - one, maybe two points at most.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Yep, armor and shield don't affect your dex bonus to AB if you're finessing or using a bow.  Though bows are two handed so you can't use them with a shield anyway.<br><br>Using a shield while single wielding doesn't affect your dex AC, either.  So you can make a singlewield dex character who uses a shield if you want.  In fact this would probably be the best tank possible - an epic dodger with SC 5, improved expertise, and a shield.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Thank you all for the kind comments and feedback.  It's always a pleasure.<br><br>For anyone concerned about the lack of Uncanny Dodge, don't be.
