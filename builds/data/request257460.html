Hello guys, glad to be in the guild!<br><br>I was considering a new build to try out for NWN2, one that I have not previously tried in any capacity in NWN or any of the previous forgotten realms games.<br><br>Mainly, I am leaning more towards a combat rogue type char. I would like to dual weild, possibly sneak attack and deal massive damage, but I don't want to dig myself into a hole where I am constantly getting owned by enemies when I go toe to toe with them.<br><br>I picture a lighting fast attacker who deals out large amounts of damange to take down multiple enemies very quickly to make up for lack of defense.<br><br>What do you think? Fighter/Assassin<br>Rouge/Assassin?<br><br>I'm really not sure.  I have search through some of the builds listed in the forum, but I cannot make heads of tails of it.<br><br>thanks

Hmm.  How about something like a strength based Rogue/ Fighter/ Blackguard with just enough dex to pick up ambidexterity.  Halfling, human, or dwarf should all work well, going something like Rogue 8/ Fighter 2/ Blackguard 10 pre-epic.  Loads of damage, high AB, 6 attacks per round, and the envy of everything evil.<br>_________________<br>(I enjoy writing parenthetically (a lot)).

He asked for NwN2 build, which is capped at lvl 20 for now. Anyhow, this is not the forum for NwN2, see Finny's link.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again
