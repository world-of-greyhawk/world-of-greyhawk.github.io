The polymorph spell is a nice way to get true seeing, regeneration and several immunities that last 1 turn/clvl.<br><br>I can also understand the thrill of zooming around in a HIPSing pixie that has both monk speed and haste.<br><br>But for combat at lvl 40, I have my doubts.<br>The forms don't merge any of your equipment, so chances are they are much weaker combatants than your natural form. <br>I have not been able to find documentation on the creature weapons of the different forms saying anything about weapon enchantments. So I wonder if their attacks are non enchanted when it comes to bypassing damage reduction?<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan

At a minimum, this character attacks as a +3 weapon (due to monk).  I guess Ki Strike 4 and 5 could be taken.<br><br>I believe spells like Stone Skin will help your attack bypass DR.<br><br>You are correct in that you'll not be as good of a fighter in mellee because of lack of gear.  I do think that Armor merges tho.  But I'm not sure on that either.<br><br>This is not a powerhouse build.  it's a fun multiform build without having to go Druid/Shifter.

Between the fact that you have no AB and no damage potential, I don't understand how you plan to do anything other than not get hit (something you still don't do wonderfully).

Ki Strike Ability is a feat (even the +1 to 3 ranges ones obtained during level up).  Thus it's not overwritten.

Keep in mind that all attackers that have a "Creature Weapon" attack as their DR rating.  So someone with 10/+3 DR attacks as a +3 weapon.<br><br>All of the Polymorph Forms have Creature Weapons.  So if you had a Stone Skin on, you would attack as a +10 weapon (not +10 AB), just +10 in terms of bypassing DR.<br><br>A 20th level Monk has 20/+1 DR.<br><br>This build also casts StoneSkin.<br><br>*shrug*<br>(I still think the +3 Ki will work.)
