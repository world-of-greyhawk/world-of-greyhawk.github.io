hey guys,<br><br>i plan on making two builds and have then battle each other to see which is "better"  ill try to post them tonight. but if im not able to finish building them it will be about a week as i have to go out of town.  im currently pulling a 12hr shift today so i might run out of time.<br><br>anyway!  just glancing at the two builds and using general knowledge as to how they would be tweaked, who do you see being the stronger fighter?<br><br>both will be tru casters with 15+ lvs of sorc/wiz.  WM and RDD will stop at 7 and 10 respectively of course.<br><br>both will duel wield twin bladed swords and wear heavy armor.<br><br>the plan is to get both to have dev. crit, and with the barb id like to get epic rage feats as well.  im not sure if you can qualify for them without being an epic barb though.?  if that is the case his sorc lvs will be nerfed to heck. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>geez 2 more hrs left at work, then i can go home and try not to fall asleep!! hehehe

I thinkk the Fighter/Wizard/WM will beat the Barbarian/Sorcerer/RDD.  If nothing else I think the extra Fighter feats, WS and EWS coupled with the WMs critical feats will win the day.<br><br>P.S. you do need to be an epic barbarian to get terrifying rage.  I believe you only need greater rage to get mighty rage and thundering rage.<br><br>Stats break down<br><b>F/W/WM</b><br>needs a good<br>STR<br>INT<br>and at least 13 DEX<br><br><b>B/S/RDD</b><br>needs a good<br>STR<br>CHA<br><br>I guess the latter one will have a better stat distribution (especially with the RDD bonuses).  But the first one will get a bonus feat at 1st level fighter, and every even level, plus a wizard bonus feat every 5th level.  Yeah, the F/W/WM has to waste feats on mobility, spring attack and whirlwind attack (I don't see expertise and dodge as being a watse).  But he'll still end up with a couple of extra feats.  I'm guessing for that one you'll go F 10/W 23/WM 7 (Picking up autostill spell 3 and an epic spell).  I don't think you'll find a nice B/S/RDD distribution that will give you an epic spell (and everything else you want) and that may be the difference.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
