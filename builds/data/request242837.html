I've tried a couple times so far, and havent had any luck.  I'd like to build a High damage, high ab/ pally smiter, with 4th level pall. spells.  The world I'm building him on demands that the mellee builds be very close to top notch, and the gear is near its highest at +5.  Most gear that goes beyond this is rp awarded gear, which doesnt happen often.<br><br>Mostly what I'm looking for is a general feat progression list for a great smiting pally WM.<br><br>I'd like to have say.. mabey near 1000 damage per smite, considering a +5 weapon, and maxed str bonus items. *Hopes it is possible*<br>_________________<br>Daryl

I don't know the layout, but: <br><br>Paladin/CoT/WM<br><br>or<br><br>Paladin/Cleric/WM<br><br>Will both get rediculous damage. You could go with a Scythe for x5 damage with a 15-20 range (I think) which could land you many 1000's of damage, easy. The CoT route is quite nice because it stacks with Paladin levels for Smite abilities, and you get better saves and rapid feat progression which will get you to WM much faster. <br><br>If you go the Cleric route you will suffer on you're ending Smite damage a little bit but you will get some nice buffs depending on how far you go. You would get Darkfire, Attribute Buffs... possibly Harm which is incredibly useful... (etc.)<br><br>Personally I would go with Paladin/CoT/WM<br><br>You also have the option of what weapon you take for WM. If you do go with the Scythe you aren't gaurenteed Criticals on every hit, and you only get 3 shots at Smite, so it is rather risky... but potentially insane (1 shot kill on success) or you could go with something like a Scimitar. You could get the range down to 10 if the weapon is keened (I think) but it would only be x3 damage. It is safer because you are far more likely to hit a Critical, though it is not as powerful. Still, it is something to be feared.<br><br>The only concern with these builds is if you run into a Pale Master who is immune to Criticals, or if there are Critical Immunity Items. And don't concern yourself with gear. You automatically get a +5 Holy Avenger so you're servers weapons dont matter. Even if you got a +7 Weapon, I would take the +5 Holy Avenger for the Dispell on hit. Also, if you take Cleric you can give yourself a +5 Shield and +5 Armour. But if that stuff is easy to find on your server then forget Cleric and go CoT.<br><br>And if it really is a Smiter you want more so than anything else, make sure you get Divine Might and Divine Shield which ill greatly increase your Damage and AC considering you should have near or over 30 Charisma without a problem. <br><br>If you want a better all-around-smiter without the Crits, I would just go Paladin/CoT. The CoT bonus feats will get the Improved Smites at a very quick rate if you take the CoT's in Epic levels. If this is the path you take then go Paladin until you get 25 Natural Charisma, then take 10 CoT to get Great Smite every 2 levels as bonus feats. After that it is up to you if you take more CoT or go back to Paladin. The Paladin levels will increase Spell Duration and DC's of your (I think its 1) offensive spell(s) while CoT will increase your Saving Throws amongst other things. <br><br>. . .<br><br>After typing all that, I suppose I should ask what route you want to go. Are their Critical Immunities on your server? Do you like mega-damage or gaurenteed-damage? Enlighten me on what you are looking for and I might be able to help.

Probably not the best build for your needs, but the <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_damageadept.html" target="_blank">Damage Adept</a> may give you some ideas on how to get good Smite damage. Problem with Smites is you only get a maximum of 3 per day, so you'd better have a good damage source besides the Smite as well.

Well, what you could do is ignore the idea of Weapon Master all together.<br><br>I had a level 30 build that had great Smiting V or VI, I forget which. It was simply 20 Paladin/10 CoT and it did around 260 Damage on a smite. If you use a Keened Rapier or Scimitar then you can hit a Critical on a 10 or 12 which means you can pretty much count on at least 1 of those Smites doing double damage which will be quite at over 500, easily.<br><br>With 40 levels though, you can add either another 10 levels of Paladin for Spell Duration and what not, or another 10 levels of CoT for saves and such. Lets say you only got Great Smiting V on this build. Since you have 10 more levels than me, you would do an extra 10 damage on your Smite. But since you have great Smiting V it is multiplied by 5. You would do 50 more damage than me at around 310 I would guess. So if you hit a Critical (which you would quite often) you would likely do well over 600 damage with a much surer chance of it. Plus you get to use a shield!<br><br>Another advantage of this build is that you dont need to spend your feats on Weapon Master Presrequisits, which, in turn, means you dont need to start with the 13 Dex and 13 Int. You will have more points to spend in Charisma, Strength, and Constitution which will help you damage and HP greatly. The major advantage though, is that since you can start with 18 Charisma, you get to 25 sooner; and that of course means you get the Great Smiting feats sooner, leaving you more room to get -MORE- Great Smiting feats.<br><br>If you go Paladin 23 straight away, add nothing but Charisma until then, and get your first two epic feats as Greater Charisma, you will have 25 Cha on your 23rd level. That leaves you 17 levels to get as many Great Smites as you can! And right after you get that 25th Charisma point, you can/should start on CoT right away which will give you Great Smiting every 2nd level as bonus feats, PLUS you can add them on your regular feats every 3 levels. I am poor at math, but I think this means that by level 34 you would have Greater Smiting VIII, and you would still have a few more feats available to get you to Great Smiting X.<br><br>But, correct me if I am wrong, CoT bonus feats stop coming every 2nd level after 10 levels of that class. Then I think they start coming every 3rd or 4th levels like normal classes. Still though, you could very likely make it to Great Smiting VIII or higher.<br><br>SO...<br><br>Assuming you only get Great Smiting VIII, and you use a Keen Scimitar, while buffed you would likely do around 700-800 damage on a critical if you have nothing but Paladin and CoT levels.<br><br>. . .<br><br>Of course I may be entirely wrong in my 10 second calculations, but I would guess forgetting Weapon Master is best unless you really are fighting Maxed Constitution Barbarian DD's with Epic Damage Reduction and what not.

To get 2000 from a crit smite you need to sacrifice everything else including playability.

Once more the obsession for huge crit ranges. I don't get it.<br><br>Guys, remember that crits first of all need to be landed hits, then they must be confirmed too which means you have to hit twice your opponents AC to land a crit: 10-20 is often worth nothing more than 16-20 if what you are facing is worth your time. I'd rather go for the higher multiplier so that when I hit it hurts.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Stand and fight, live by your heart<br>Always one more try, I'm not afraid to die<br>Stand and fight, say what you feel<br>Born with a Heart of Steel!

I would, in most cases, agree with you Kail. But I would think that with a Smiter it is different. 10-20/x2 is a good percentage chance of threatening a Critical, with double the damage. Double the damage of an Epic Smite is quite formidable (Can raise above 800) which would, in my opinion, make a x3 Multiplier a bit of overkill. Plus, you stated that with your build there is a Smite AB of 77. 1d20 + 77 could surpass the AC of most things you will need to encounter. <br><br>So lets say you go the 10-20/x2 route. For your attack you would get 1d20 + 77AB... to threaten a critical you need to roll a 10. Rolling as such would give you an 88 to your Smite Attack in total. That, in my experiences will hit most things you need to worry about. That would make the 10-20/x2 useful. If you can hit on a 10, like this build can, the range is definetly enjoyable and practical concidering you will probably kill the enemy in one shot, and if not you have 2 more shots at it or you can just attack them normally with a still more-than-decent AB.<br><br>With almost any other build though I would side with you Kail. But when the Smite can Up your AB that much I would think the wide range crit is worth it.

I think you make a very good point, Okembour. I read Kail's post and was nodding my head going 'Yup, just the way I see it too', but you make a lot of sense. Considering the Smite boost to AB does not count towards the cap, a wider crit range will almost guarantee a crit in most circumstances. Although I'm a proponent of the bigger multiplier, for the reason you've laid out, I think it's often probably worth pursuing the bigger crit range in Smite builds.

Well yeah, true the wider crit range basically guarantees a critical smite I have to admit it. <br><br>I guess my tendency is to go with a higher non smite damage output at the same "effective" crit range (when you consider landed crits), hence the x3 multiplier choice, since you get only 3 smites a day.<br><br>I'd say that with no rest restriction the scimitar is definitely the way to go, with rest restriction there's a choice to be made which ultimately is up to personal preference... if only we could get more smites a day! <br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

Its late. I'm tired. When I'm tired I make an *** out of myself. But here it goes.<br><br>What is the point of fighter in that build if it doesn't take the WS and EWS feats? Isn't that the whole point of 4 fighter levels? Sometimes its used to grant a higher AB or a 4th attack, as well as meating the prerequisits for the Weapon Master class. But none of those things are needed in this build, so whats the point?<br><br>Wouldn't those fighter levels be better spent in extra Paladin for spell duration and additional Smite Damage, or Champion of Torm for better saves, Wrath, and Smite Damage? If its a Smite Damage focussed build then the Paladin and/or CoT levels would serve better than 4 Fighter levels that don't even give the Weapon Specializations.<br><br>So.. as I said, I'm tired and potentially stupid.

Epic CoT gets bonus feats every 4 lvls not every 2 and Fighter gets a bonus feat at first lvl too, so Fighter nets you <b>2 more feats</b> (3 vs 1) both compared to paladin and CoT. Spell duration is good enough with 26 Pal lvls I'd say and you're already undispellable. Divine Wrath increases every 5 lvls so CoT 14 wouldn't improve it, but it would just improve saves by +2.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 06/06/06 01:40</span></i></p>

Well, I saw that you got the 3rd feat at first level, so I guess fighter gains you some extra feats. But is the build that feat starved that it would sacrifice the Saves, Spell Duration, and Smite Damage? Meh... I guess 2 feats would make a difference considering you spend 10 feats on Smites, and likely some in Greater Charisma for the Smites... so I suppose its justified. I guess it would be preference.

Try looking at it from this angle:<br><br>What two feats would you give up? Then ask yourself if sacrificing those two feats is worth:<br><br>1) With more CoT levels, +2 to saves and +40 on Smite damage, which is only useable 3 times per rest.<br><br>2) With more Pally levels, 4 more rounds or turns duration on spells (the hour-long buffs are completely negligable, as  there's practically no difference between 26 hours and 30 hours. The same argument could possibly be made for turn duration spells as well) and +40 on Smite damage.<br><br>Personally, I'd say the feats are more valuable.

See it this way: those two feats mean +1 AB, +2 AC (EP and AS). Without Fighter one has to drop them if you want to achieve Great Smite X. The preepic feats are even less than what I'd like to have actually, although I get all the basic stuff. IKD and Called Shot would not have hurted anyhow, for example.<br><br>Anyhow, the point of the last version was to get <i>Great Smite X with a playable build with the best AB and AC possible</i> and that's what it does.<br><br>A matter of preference? Ultimately yes, as always. If you prefer to go for Paladin 30 or CoT 14 then do it. Out of interest: which feats would you give up?<br><br>As for me I feel Smite damage is already good enough, saves too but I could surely do with a little more AB and AC. Personally I'd go with the Great Smite VI version with WS/EWS, I like my base damage output to be as good as possible.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

Meh... Depends where I'm playing. I suppose its all about the rest rules. If its only 3 smites a day and you cant rest often then I would take knockdown like you did, in order to help playability. But if its some arena server where I can rest at will and all my foes are evil because I am on the good team, then I wouldnt take knockdown since my smites are 1 shot kills. I would rather take the Epic Weapon Specialization if I was taking fighter at all, otherwise I would raise my saves incase of them filthy mage-types! <br><br>Just preference. But on a PW server or something along those lines, I would take fighter and knockdown for playability and the capability to stand even when fighting a non-evil thingy.

Indeed, the environment will dictate some choices. I generally build with PWs in mind and I like my characters to be as playable as possible given what I want to achieve. I consider rest restrictions to be the standard, cause without them it gets much less challenging.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

I'm terribly sorry to dig this up from the past, but I've officially decided that rather than taking those Fighter levels, I would take Rogue.<br><br>*nods* I was compelled to share that with you all.<br><br>UMD and Tumble would be pretty kick-*** with this build. Some extra AC, and the ability to use scrolls... very valuable no matter what enviroment you play in!<br><br><br><br>...Sorry
