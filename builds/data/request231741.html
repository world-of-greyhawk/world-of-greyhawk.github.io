I want to build up the Avatar of Thor, or the champion of Thor if you want. I have loads of ideas, the first was Druid/Barbarian/CoT. A cleric would probably be better in this case(over Druid), unless you go caster heavy, and get melee help from the other two classes. <br><br>Barbarian is a must, I'm also leaning towards CoT for the great save/feat combo. And I need lightning. That would mean a caster class. Cleric/Druid/Wiz and sorc all gets lightning spells, eh?<br><br>Well just feed me some ideas to help my mind sort out my ideas. <br><br>I will build the Druid thing and see what can be done there. I was thinking of 15 Barb for terrifying rage, Druid up to 9 lvl spells, and CoT for whatever can be spared. Can't a H-Orc do okay in this build, seeing as he has bonus to STR and no WIS penalty? The number of skillpoints willo be lacking though, and I can never get enough, so human will prob be better.<br><br>Don't post complete builds or a total level guide, please, I want ideas and experiences, stating the obvious etc.<br><br>Grimnir out<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

First off, Druid does not get Chain Lightning nor Lightning Bolt. A Cleric with Air domain gets Chain Lightning and Call Lightning, which sounds quite spiffy <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  <br><br>Well, let's begin with the Druid <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   Barbarian 15/Druid 25 with Epic Penetration gets exactly 32 minimum penetration power, so it's not a bad choice. However, I got the idea you wanted to stick CoT levels in there. You did state that you only wanted 9th level spells; do you mean you're not worried about penetration? If so, Druid 18/Barbarian 16/CoT 6 sounds decent (though, is CoT a must? Fighter gets EWS as you probably know <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   ). It should be noted that Druid/Barbarian/CoT does not get Armor Profiency: Heavy for free, while a Fighter does (as does a Cleric).<br><br>Assuming the Druid 18/Barbarian 16/Fighter 6 is fine with you, we get a total of 18 feats, minus 2 (EWS), minus 1 (Terrifying Rage). Two of these may be Fighter bonus feats, but TR must be a general epic feat. This leaves us with 2 Fighter bonus feats, 6 epic feats and 7 pre-epic feats. Counting... a metamagic feat, Toughness, WF, SF: Int, BF, KD, IKD, IC - 8 pre-epic feats desired. We can thus move the remaining Fighter bonus feat to epic, ergo we now have 7 epic feats. EWF, EP, ESF: Int, Great X, Great X, Great X, Great X. Swap Druid for Cleric with Air Domain and it's starting to look like a decent buffing build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  How does that sound?<br><br>As for a Wizard or Sorcerer, I don't think Arcane spells fit the concept as well as priest spells. However, a basic Sorc/Paladin is quite powerful and you could disguise it as a Norse hero <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">  If only a Sorcerer got Call Lightning...<br><br>Btw, it'd be nice if you gave us a little more info on what you have in mind for the build. I mean the vision you have in your head, now you're just saying a Champion of Thor which is more than a little vague <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 02/25/06 12:58</span></i></p>

Thanks so far, Finn, knew I could count on you.<br>So far, lightning, thunder, terifying and heavy armour. It makes the Druid 25 route nice, But cleric/fighter/Barb<br>with Air domain and perhaps War is a nice buffing/casting path. Got my mind going now.<br><br>SR for more offensive power, sure, not necessarily in the cleric route, though.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Cleric with air domain gets call lightning as druid does plus chain lightning, so more lightning being cleri than druid, but that's as far as lightning can get, good for large groups, but not what I would think of really powerful magics, in fact, a weapon with lightning damage sounds more promising than casting lightning, and Thor uses a warhammer. (too bad there's not a two-handed warhammer)<br><br>You could go with CoT for the saves, but I don't think your CHA will be high (so forget divine wrath), a fighter sounds like a good addition, but you're using one or two weapons? if skills are not too important start with a lot of STR, CON and DEX enough for ambidexterity nand go for two, althouhg heavy armor would suck that DEX you still get reflex for it, but somehow I think you're more inclined towards a shield.......<br><br>Cleric 15 / Fighter 6 / Barbarian 19? or maybe more fighter for feats, I'm not sure how much Barbarian you need.

I see we are inching towards something here. Gonna see how much fighter is needed, since that will determine the final split. It seems the path we are getting close to is Cleric 15, little fighter and Barb around 17-19 or so.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

For me Cleric (with Air Domain) is a must. Barbarian too for Terrifying and Thundering. <br><br>For the third, I would opt for CoT, but purely because of the concept of imitating god-like power.<br><br>Fighter would work better for the one extra feat.<br><br>Nice task you've set yourself. good luck

Cleric 17 (air and war/strength domains)- Barbarian 17 (terrifying and thundering rage)- Fighter 6 (WS/EWS and another 2 bonus feats) could be a good split but I agree that being a chosen of Thor, lvls in CoT would better fit the concept. Too bad CoT doesn't get WS.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Just some bits to consider (but you are probably aware of them already):<br><br>Going Cleric/ Barb/ Fighter will bring an xp penalty. Going CoT instead of Fighter negates the penalty.<br><br>If you want a decent DC on your Chain and Call Lightning spells, then Spell Focus and Greater Spell Focus: Evocation are needed. Epic Spell Focus: Evocation will not be open to take as it is doubtful you will get 21+ Cleric levels.<br><br>No Class skill in Tumble, so may be worth considering Travel Domain to grab Haste. <br><br>Terrifying Rage - would really benefit from ESF: Intimidate as well.<br><br>Thundering Rage - need 25 STR - bearing in mind the requirement for WIS for Cleric casting, you may find that any CHA based Domain power will probably be wasted as a result.<br><br>CoT in epic levels - gives you Great WIS. Could be what you need to get your spell casting sorted out. <br><br>You should be able to qualify for both Terrifying and Thundering Rage with only 16 Barbarian levels. <br><br>So you could potentially go Cleric 18, Barb 16, CoT 6 - giving you 3 points to saves, 3 feats and the power of the Mighty Thor to pound your enemies into dust with your mighty hammer, Mjölnir. Not sure if you could work it to make use of Divine Wrath. The CHA value bothers me some in this combination.<br><br>Looks like a cracking class mix and would be a huge amount of fun to play. Have to say I am intrigued to see the outcome. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Thundering Rage has a nice name which suits the concept, but it is really sa waste of an epic feat and not really worth it, so it's not going in there. Btw, the build is ready, i just need the little time it takes to get it written up and posted. It will be one version with fighter, and one alternate with CoT to avoid penalties, but loosing EWS. Since it's a concept build, i don't care too much about xp-penalties in this one, though I normally do.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.
