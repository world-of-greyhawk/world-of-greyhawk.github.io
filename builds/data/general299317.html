hello <br><br>I play on a rp server where half orcs only count as big humans, and with the recent un-banning of RDDs I decided to make a character with the best possible strength.<br><br>I started out just seeing what the max str is. 20 from Half orcs starting stats + 10 gained from upgraiding skills during leveling + 8 from RDD levels + 10 from great Str and 12 from gear (not plus 12 gear just from a couple of different items) that all adds up to a massive 60 str<br><br>seeing as the character would be almost unplayable and just for rp i started building randomly without really caring about making it a good build. after spending about a hour coming up with the sam maz str of 57 i figured something was wrong<br><br>I figured I would write it all out and seeing as Great str can only be taken after 21 that means there are only 7 epic feats....now that shouldent be a problem seeing as Wizard can take great int as a extra feat right? well...wrong...sadly no classes seem to have great str as a extra feat....<br><br>Is that really a big deal...? no...not really 57 is a huge amount of str...but it got me thinking....is it really only possible to take 7 great STRs? almost all the other great skills can be taken up to ten....Charisma and dex in bard, wisdom in cleric, int in wizard....in fact the only ones missing seem to be Strength and constitution.<br><br>The game says you can take the feat up to ten times and you can in almost all the others so....am I just being a idiot and missing something? or is Great strength seven really the most you can take <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">

Great STR feat can only be taken on a regular feat level 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36 and 39. There are no classes that have Great STR available as a bonus feat. I believe you can take Great CON to 10 as well. Barbarians and Dwarven Defenders, I think, have that as bonus feats.

Nope sorry Dwarven Defenders and barbarians dont have great Con. I think 7 is the max for that too.<br><br>You would think that Barbarian would have Great con and Great str and fighter would have Great str but no classes seem to have it

You are correct. There are a number of prestige classes that get Gr. Str in the PRC, if you want to install it. But in standard NWN, the max possible str is 20 (start) + 10 (ability increases) + 8 (RDD) + 6 (Gr. Str) = 44. You can buff that to 56. <br><br>You can waste one more Gr. Str to get to 45 (57 buffed), but all you gain is carrying capacity, which is already so high that there is no point.<br><br>TM

My favorite high str devvers are 26 Ranger 4 Bard 10 RDD.  The Ranger gives great dmg, nice skillset, spot (which Bard doesn't allow), and 3 epic bonus feats (if you take 25th Ranger FE as EWF/EP).  Fighter would yield more feats, and nearly as high of dmg, but 1 less AB (vs. FE) and no Ranger buffs.
