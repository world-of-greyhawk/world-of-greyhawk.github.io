Can a single pc get 50% concealment AND at least 9/- damage reduction?<br><br>Monks get both as bonus feats, but I am not sure you could get both the 21 con and 30 dex necessary.

Defender lvl 10 give 6/-.  Defender gets more reduction every 4 levels after 10, so a 14 defender has your 9/-.  In order to get the Damage Reduction feats you need to have 21 con.  Not too hard, but may be enough to make it hard to get all 50% of your conceal (but you need 30 dex, 30 hide, 30 tumble I believe).  Maybe a fighter/DD/Rogue.  4/11/25?  Or even a straight DD/Rogue?  Fighter levels might help getting the feats.  Would take a little longer to get the +7 ab, but you will get it eventually.  Even 30 or 40% conceal would be worth it.  If you could throw in Epic Dodge, you would be set.  Tough build, but sounds like you should be able to get atleast some of what you want.<br><br>I currently have a fighter/DD/WM (9/11/7) and will maximize DR.  He will have 21/- base I believe if I calculated it right.  Lower AC, good BAB since they are all fighter based, and a tough tank with a few other DR and soak items.

I know self concealment is a bonus feat for monks that you can choose . .though I still think you need the reqs for it. <br><br>Haven't had a chance to find a build or do the math to see if I can get 21 con and 30 dex/tumble on the same pc soon enough

You can get Self Concealment, but it will take more DEX(total of 30), 30 ranks in Hide and Tumble, and improved invasion feat. This type is not dispellable, unlike the Empty Body, but it will change the way the build works.<br><br>But the downside of this feat, you will have to take it five time if you want to get 50% concealment I think. So you lose out four other useful feats unless you took fighter class(two feats every three levels I think in pre-epic levels).<br><br>Anuis

FYI, fighter gets one feat every even level <b>and</b> one at lvl one totaling 11 feats at level 20.
