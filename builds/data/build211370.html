Did u consider being a Dwarf? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>It would mean sacrificing the 'luck of heroes' (or another subsequent) feat but with the same starting stats you would have 18 con...allowing you to have a finishing Strength of 34...or u could raise initial Wisdom to get some bonus Monk AC...<br><br>Maybe:<br><br>Str - 16 (32)<br>Dex - 14 (14)<br>Con - 16 (22)<br>Int - 10 (12)<br>Wis - 14 (14)<br>Cha - 6 (8)<br><br>Would give your build +2 AC at a loss of 1 to Fortitude and Reflex save but +1 to will which is the builds weakest save anyway! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>Just a suggestion...nice build btw!<br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!

I like the idea behind the build it makes it very unique, I made a similar one. A few questions though:<br><br>1. Why not put the 1 monk into the RDD since the extra monk level does not do anything? The extra level in RDD would give an extra 1d10 to your breath weapon (9d10 overall) and increase HP.<br>2. Have you thought about raising your wisdom at all to increase your DC for your stunning attacks and quivering palm? This will also increase your AC and will saves (as already stated)<br>3. Is the damage reduction neccessary since a monk gains a 20/+1 at level 20? Does the DR stack? Maybe using these spare feats for increasing your wisdom or taking up improved spell resistance.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Jehoshua on 09/05/05 08:41</span></i></p>

The DR does not stack.  And Improved Spell resistance isn't going to help much against high level mages anyway with only 21 monk levels.  9 points off of every hit can be quite nice though.<br><br>Steve

Depending if you want to improve your will saves at the cost of reflex, you could start at DEX 10 and WIS 14.<br><br>What you lose is -1 AC from dodge, -2 reflex, -2 tumble.<br>What you gain is +2 will, +2 to stunning fist/quivering palm DC, 1 feat (like "iron will" for a additionnal +2 to will).<br><br>Not that important since you got "perfect self" but you mentioned your will save as low so...<br><br>Not a clear improvement, just a matter of taste <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Another point, you could take DR 3 earlier (in place of epic reflexes) which will improve your gaming experience <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  (since it is the point of the build).<br><br>Again not really an improvement. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Good job,<br>aquamoeba

Thank you for the comments everyone.<br><br>As for being a dwarf, yes it could allow you better stat distribution but would incure an exp penalty which I try to avoid at all costs.<br><br>The low will saves were not really a concern due to a monks immunity to mind spells.  Due to the poor selection of RDD epic feats(for a melee character), I had to belate Armor Skin and EDR III to the later levels.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;2.

It would really depend on how your PW is set up and the kind of saves the NPCs have.  I decided to skip it because to me, 10 or 14 was not a huge difference.  Also, like I said will saves are not really a concern.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Talamier on 09/05/05 17:53</span></i></p>

Take one of your pre epic Stat increases into CHA, and take gr.STR instead of Epic reflexes, you will have CHA of 11 at the end. Take a sorc lev after that to gain access to lvl1 sorc spells, namely true strike and mage armor. Not much but it helps. And end your build Monk 28/Sorc2/RDD10, since your extra RDD levels don't really give you much except hp's, one AC (as would monk 25) and better breath(useless IMO). You would increase monk stunning fist, SR and get a more even boost to your tumble AC, plus those few sorce spells, and perhaps you have access to CHA boosters. If you really want those RDD levs, go Bard instead of Sorce, and take your last monk level as Bard. It will grant you a tiny bard song and a nice choice of skills. All monk's plus UMD and spellcraft.

I guess it would depend on what you wanted to do.  I mainly took the RDD for HP but in the end it's only 28 more HPs.  Monk SR would seem more important and stunning fist can be quite powerful.<br><br>As far as level 1 sorc spells, I do not see them doing much at the level that I would gain them save true strike.
