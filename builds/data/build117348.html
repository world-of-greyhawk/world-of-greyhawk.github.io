Hi everyone. This is my contribution: <br>a character that gets: <br>level 9 spells, <br>auto still-spell 1-3, <br>2 epic spells, <br>4 attacks/round (normal), <br>weapon spec., <br>epic weapon spec., <br>overwhelming crits., <br>dev. crits., <br>and all the weapon master feats!<br><br>Sounds impossible? Well it was near =C, but I definitely pulled it off. I call it... the SPELLSWORD (generic enough for you?  ). <br><br>starting abilites:<br>STR: 17<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 10<br>INT: 16<br>WIS: 8<br>CHA: 8<br><br>pre-epic:<br>fighter/wizard/wm 9/4/7<br>Feats (8 human, 5 fighter):<br>WM pre-reqs: dodge, mobility, spring attack, whirlwhind, expertise, weapon focus (scimitar)<br>still spell, empower spell(can sub this for toughness, but I prefer empower)<br>power attack, cleave, great cleave<br>improved crit (scimitar), weapon spec. (scimitar)<br><br>Abilities @ lvl 20:<br>STR: 22<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 10<br>INT: 16<br>WIS: 8<br>CHA: 8<br><br><br>epic levels:<br>Normal epic feats:<br>lvl 21: Epic weapon focus (scimitar)<br>lvl 24: Great STR I<br>lvl 27: Overwhelming Crits.<br>lvl 30: Devastating Crits.<br>lvl 33: Auto still-spell I<br>lvl 36: Auto still-spell II<br>lvl 39: Epic spell (epic mage armor)<br><br>Wizard bonus feats (4 non-epic, 1 epic @ lvl 40 wizard lvl 23):<br>lvl 21: Great INT I<br>lvl 26: Great INT II<br>lvl 31: Great INT III<br>lvl 36: Auto still-spell III<br>lvl 40: Epic Spell (epic warding)<br><br>Fighter bonus feats (1):<br>lvl 38: epic weapon spec. (scimitar)<br><br>Final Abilities @ lvl 40 (raising naturally only STR):<br>STR: 28<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 10<br>INT: 19<br>WIS: 8<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Final skills:<br>Concentration: 43 (max)<br>Spellcraft: 43 (max)<br>Discipline: 41 (max - 2) since it is not a wizard class skill, max @ clvl 38 fighter<br>Heal: 43 (max)<br>Tumble: 21 (max, cross-class)<br>Intimidate: 4 (pre-req for weapon master)<br><br>and 52 points left over that I don't know what to do with =p. I suppose persuade, lore or whatever. <br><br>Equipment: good scimitar, good shield, good armor, good belt of strength, good headband of intellect, good boots, good rings, good amulet, good gloves, and you're set! lol. <br><br>Final words:<br>INT is not worth raising to 20, because you only need to get 26 INT with items to get an additional 9th lvl bonus spell slot... which isn't hard. Two more bonus spell slots is impossible with this build (Need 34 INT). The only thing having a higher INT does, is increase the DC on your spells' saving throws, but in general you're not going to use your spells to do direct damage. <br><br>Build weaknesses: HP and relatively low saving throws (although your spells can make up for this).... But, anyway, aren't these weaknesses of every spellcaster?<br><br>Build strengths: ownz.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/10/07 13:56</span></i></p>
