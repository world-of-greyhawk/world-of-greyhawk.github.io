Hey and Welcome to the Guild.<br><br>Great build idea - I'm surprised there's not another one out there already. But Cleric and WM is hard to pull off - lots of pre-reqs that usually encourage Fighter since the Fighter bonus feats help qualify for Weapon Master.<br><br>First thing I'd advise is keeping Cleric levels to 8 pre-epic (instead of 10) so you don't lose AB.  Does it take 10 levels of Cleric to qualify for CoT? Or did you want to preserve some CoT for Epic levels to get Epic Bonus Feats?<br><br>Another suggestion is to drop Dwarven Axe since it burns up a precious feat (Exotic Weapons Proficiency). I'd advise Battle Axe or Scimitar or Morning Star. Battle Axe or Morning Star would look better RP-wise.<br><br>If you dropped Exotic Weapons you could go Dwarf and boost Con a bit.<br><br>Just some thoughts. Nice build though!<br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br>What I'm reading now:<br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0874779405/103-5804382-8859066?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance" target="_blank">The White Spider</a> by Heinrich Harrer.

Thanks for the reply.  I took dwarven war axe because I only had cleric weapons to choose from, so no battle axe, and morning stars just aren't too common dropwise for finding a good one, the 1 feat I need for exoctic I think is worth it to get a decent non cleric weapon.  I contemplated going elf and using an elf weapon, but humans get an extra feat, so..<br>You do have to take 10 cleric levels to qualify for COT, plus I need the COT levels in epic for wisdom feats.  I think the COT brings more to the build than a fighter would because of the saving throws(fortitude and reflex, &amp; the +5 bonus from the 10 levels).  Thanks again for your input.

Unless treasure is rolled by different scripts than base NWN, weapon drops from containers depend heavily on what you have weapon focus in.  So if you have focus in morning star, most containers that drop a weapon should usually drop a morning star.<br><br>If you haven't got any focus it tends to drop a club.<br><br>The dwarven waraxe is a fine weapon but I'd also suggest saving the feat and going morning star, unless you're on a server that has strong waraxes and doesn't have strong morning stars.  But the waraxe does have some "cool value" to it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

CoT requires 7 BA to qualify. Since he's using 2 prestige classes, one of them WM which he needs the CoT feats to qualify for, he does need to hit 10 Cleric first to start taking CoT.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

It is a solid build, no doubt about it. I actually didn't read race, just assumed it was a Dwarf. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">  It wasn't. No matter. <br><br>I too, wondered why it's called Odins fury. No fury, no Odin. In Norse myths as far as I can tell, divine magic is called Seiding. So a cleric would be a Seid-man or -woman. Arcane is Galdring. This is not totally right, but as close as it gets.<br><br>You might get into the Guild of Norse Heroes, but not just by its name. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Welcome to the Epic builders guild though. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

First forgive me if I take all of you quite literally, when you were just commenting, perhaps in jest.  My wife constantly tells me I take everything too literally.<br>I like Nordic sagas, and while I don't have the breadth of knowledge that Grimnir77 does(I love your builds and stories) I have read several different Nordic Sagas.  I chose to use Odin because he's a God and I had cleric and Champion of Torm, but he's not a Torm-ite.  I know the Fury really conjures up barbarian images, I had wanted to use "rage" or "wrath" for like a concept of the God's anger empowers the character.  So...<br>It wouldn't be too hard I don't think to adapt it to a dwarf, you could re-organize the feats a little and loose toughness maybe, the extra con would compensate for that, but I think it would work out.

Forgive me if I am wrong here but should'nt a Champion of Odin or Cleric of Odin for that matter,use a Spear as his weapon,seeing how that is Odins weapon of choice...or am I wrong in thinking that?<br>_________________<br>Would you offer your throat to the wolf with a Rose in it's mouth?

Grungnir, Odins spear is a gift from Loki. I do not know if it is his preferred weapon, seeing as he hardly use weapon in any myth. But spear would give style point for a Seid-man(cleric) of the one-eyed god.

I really considered a spear for rp reasons, if you could use a spear one handed I definately would have, but having a shield is just too much of a bonus, at least in my opinion.  Really you can choose any weapon, everyone is freaking out about a human using a dwarven war axe, change it to katana, or broad sword, or take a cleric weapon or martial proficiencies instead of exoctic, it doesn't really alter the basic concept of the build.<br><br>Also I forgot to put in the skills.  I keep discipline, spellcraft, and concentration maxed up, and any character I play I put a point or two into open locks.
