Alright id like Half-Demon and Half-Angel builds.<br><br>Aasimar has got to have Paladin Levels, while I'd like the Tiefling to have Blackguard/Rogue, respecting there race's favored classes.  But the Aasimar has got to be good and the Tiefling has got to be evil.  I'd like to thank you, ya'll have good ideas.  This is also PvE and maonly a RP build.<br><br>Oh, yeah im getting the info from: <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/planetouched.htm#aasimar" target="_blank">Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By PlyrSilver on 08/16/07 21:58</span></i></p>

Also, more information on your build would be nice.  Do you want DEX or STR?  Do you want a melee, sneak, or caster?  Important stuff to know, before we give you anything decent. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

Just a thought..  it looks like you are playin on a modified PRC server.  I am not sure how many peeps here play PRC.  THis is important because there are ALOT of extras that PRC brings that should be taken into account.  I know cuz for the last 1.5 yrs I have played on a PRC server.  I have found that it is best to post build help with the server forums simply because the people posting there understand ALL the subtleties.  <br><br>Just my two cents.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Avado (as usual <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    ) makes a very good point, but many of us here are familiar with both Aasimars and Tieflings ('specially those of us who also play NWN2 and/or PrC, too)     <br><br>Yep, they're in NWN2 as PC races(planetouched), and I personally love them both (Aasimar paladins, just plain wonderful (and make a great race for clerics, too  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">      , as they get +2 stat bonus to both wis and cha, with their innate resistances and keen senses (and zero penalties in turn apart from being an ECL race) more about which everyone can read here: <a href="http://www.nwn2wiki.org/Aasimar" target="_blank">http://www.nwn2wiki.org/Aasimar</a><br><br>Tiefling's are wonderful, too, with a different set of racial boni (+2 dex, +2 intel., but -2 cha and also ECL; then, with free darkness, make great sneakers, this is true, and more about which everyone can read here: <a href="http://www.nwn2wiki.org/Tiefling" target="_blank">http://www.nwn2wiki.org/Tiefling</a><br><br>Of course, this is all general so far as it's the way NWN2 does it, and may not be the same on your or any other server. Also, and generally speaking, planetouched are pnp (supposed to get the free martial feat which is nice, but offset by the fact they're vulnerable to turning in pnp, which isn't so nice -- neither of which are true in NWN2 so far as this stuff wasnt implemented, however: that said, it may or may not be the case that a server where such subraces are available might have implemented these things, so you might want to check that); Otherwise, as noted, would be very helpful to know more details about your server, etc., and also more about what it you're looking for.

That's a nice build, Mantis: pal/monks, always work (and fallen pallys, ohhhh, excellent RP value, too! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>Depending on the stat adj. and what the OP's looking for, was actually thinking about somthing similar, along the lines of pal 15/cot 5/monk 20 (or, for the 21 monk glowing eyes, could do: pal 15/monk 21 and either CoT or FTR 4; having established (I think <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    that it's a PNP thing (and assuming not vulnerable to turning), then it should be (but no guarantee as also server dependent) that aasimars, as outsiders, come with glowing eyes automatically, no? <br><br>If so, then could go paladin 26/cot 5/monk 9 or (depending on magic level of the world, whether scrolls are available to make umd worthwhile, something like: pal 26/rogue 13/monk 1. Since the OP says it's low magic then probably not worth it (assuming scrolls aren't all that available; then again, all depends on what's meant by "low magic" -- i.e., from +1 to +3 items, I'd assume, but some consider up to +5 as low-magic, too. <br><br>Ah, but so many ways to enjoy an aasimar (or tiefling), this is true: as a smiter, a buffing meleer (with or without dev.crit), a sneaker, or anything else really.
