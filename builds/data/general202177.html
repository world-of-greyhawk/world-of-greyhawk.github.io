I was wondering if there was a reason why I should make a level 40 cleric. At level 20 fighter get Epic Fighter, Barbarians get Epic Barbarain, so I am sure there is a Epic CLeric. But what I was wondering was if there were any other bonus feats after Epic cleric?

Clerics get bonus feats at 23, 26, 29, 32, 35 and 38 (every 3 epic levels) best option is to dload the grimoire off of nwvault.ign.com and you can look up exactly what they get to pick from <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-DaMouse

First, any non-pretige class is Epic after lv 20, regardless, and clerics are no exception.  Why take a cleric past lv 20?  It really depends on what you want to do with the build.  The lvls give spell duration.  <br><br>The real question is, why do you want to make a cleric, not a lv 40 cleric?  Pure clerics are great (being a cleric lover that i am), but you have to decide HOW you want to play.  Clerics are basically buffers with some defensive spells (they have offense too, just not as many as wiz/sor or druid).  With their buffs and nice wisdom and charisma (20+ each) you can get some decent melee ability out of them.   There are lots of reasons to take a cleric past lv 20.  But, to lv 40?  Besides a pure caster wix or sorc, is there a reason to take ANY class to 40?  <br><br>Peace

I would like to make a pure level 40 cleric, I have never made a pure character before, and I was just wondering if anything good came out of doing so. But thanks for your help. I think I am going to make a level 40 cleric.

If you are going the pure route, what i suggest is to decide to do EITHER a pure wisdom build or to do a wisdom/charisma split.   There are some out there who have done the str cleric (myself included) but those are clerics with fighter classes.<br><br>I am sorta torn at my suggestion in that, having a cleric with 30+base wisdom is great for number of spells, but mixing in charisma and divine feats gives you a nice mix.  If you are interested in what i mean, let me know and i will make one.<br><br>Peace

Thanks for the offer, but I would prefer to make my own. Maybe you would like to check my idea out, for a level one of course, on the.... I guess I post it on the build request?

a pure cleric would have very nice divine damage, could actually probably even best aplly rdd for a short time.<br><br>i would sue the cleric bonus feats for wisdom, while going into charisma with the stats + and the regular feats.<br>you can also get a killer implosion spell if you take epic spell focus evocation and a lot of wisdom.<br>(at which point zen archery can become handy also)

Torias -- don't know if he still is around, but one of the great builders IMHO -- made a full cleric at one point.  Not sure what you're looking for in particular, but I would start there.  To me, it is the best all-around way to do a true cleric.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "122098", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>P.S.
