The Sun domain was chosen to enhance the cleric's role as undead slayer, as it grants two very useful spells against the undead as well as an improvement to Turn Undead, while Healing improves the effectiveness of healing spells by casting them as if they were empowered.  The high wisdom boosts the effectiveness of all spells and helps add additional slots to the cleric's repertoire, making more offensive spells available.  Items that give the cleric more spell slots would also be very helpful.<br><br>Most of the spell improvement feats I included were strictly meant to make more individual spells available to the cleric rather than to confer the respective bonuses to those spells, though I do not deny the value of those bonuses.  I originally put in Automatic Quicken Spell so that healing spells could be casted much more quickly, since nothing hurts like getting a healing spell off just as an ally is slain.  When I tested the build, however, I found that quickened spells make the cleric a true spellslinger, which is helpful considering how I intend for the cleric to have quite an arsenal of offensive spells at his or her disposal; what good is preparing many offensive spells when the caster can only get a few of them off before the party is routed?  I also like Automatic Quicken Spell because it allows spells to be prepared at a higher quality (that is, maximized or empowered) and receive the benefits of quick casting.<br><br>I'm confident in my choice of Greater Ruin for the cleric's epic spell.  I don't think lawful good clerics should have undead minions, and I'm not so sure that Dragon Knight is worthwhile since the cleric receives a neat planar summon spell (Planar Ally) at caster level 9.  Greater Ruin also fits in nicely with the offensive spellcaster theme I'm using.<br><br>What I'm not confident in is my choice of the Healing domain.  I imagine that a maximized healing spell with the automatic empowerment offered by the domain would really be overkill (overheal?), though I suppose that it can't hurt to be too healthy.  I'm considering Good as an alternative to extend Turn Undead to also turn outsiders and for the Stoneskin spell.<br><br>This build could be modified a little to be suitable for evil clerics, but the build was made with a lawful good cleric in mind.  Naturally I didn't look into Blackguard, and Champion of Torm seems to be for more melee-oriented clerics.  I wonder if it would be worthwhile to take one level of monk at 40 to get a huge AC bonus, but I don't like the idea of taking just one level of anything (why in the world would a powerful cleric suddenly study the martial arts?).<br><br><br><br><i>Corrected Typo - Kail Pendragon</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 09/22/08 20:38</span></i></p>

Silent spell and still spell have NOTHING to do with their names.  THey do something much more valuable for a caster cleric.  They allow you to cast spells one slot higher than normal.  That is why they are sooo important to a caster cleric.<br><br>My advice is, if you have never played a character DONT post it in this forum.  THis forum is for FINISHED buiilds, which yours is not.  When you have an idea (like this clearly is) post it in the discussion forums.  The truly sad thing is that we could have some newbie come by and take your build as an epic build, when it is clearly not.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/28/06 00:22:49 (GMT) -- TyrTemplar<br><br>This post is for general information purposes only, and does not constitute a legal opinion or render any legal advice.

Well, it's a caster cleric, so there's not a whole lot one can say about it other than it will do well.  In spite of feat selection and stats, you should do just fine.  Since he is a caster cleric, and pure at that, I would forego Extend Spell for Skill Focus: Concentration, and probably try to grab ESF: Concentration.  I picture a guy like this taking out the trash with SoVs and Implosion, as well as healing his party.  Due to low hit points, it probably would be a safe idea to try to insure that every spell cast is successful.  Whether that's through beefing up your Concentration score or going Improved Combat Casting, or both, is something for debate.  <br><br>As for Quicken, that's one of those envirorment things, and I know many PWs have either nerfed or outright banned permahaste.  Given your domain selections, it may not be a bad choice to go with some Autoquickens.  <br><br>Finally, I'm going to nitpick the name, as "Ruinous" conjures up someone or something depraved and rotten.  You stated that you pictured him to be Lawful/Good with Sun and Healing domains.  That doesn't exactly inspire "ruinous."  Maybe righteous?<br><br>Anyway, thank you, and welcome to the Guild.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I would, probably, shake up starting stats a bit.<br><br>Str: 14<br>Dex: 8<br>Con: 14<br>Wis: 16 <br>Int: 10<br>Cha: 14<br><br>Or something. Maybe even considering dumping CHA points for INT or DEX. But not sure what a pure Cleric needs skillpoints for. Concentration and Spellcraft is really what you want. x-class Tumble. And you're set with your current INT. Rest would some x-class skills, so probably enough with 10 INT. (Can anyone REALLY belive I said that???)<br><br>Dropping Spell penetration is a good idea too. Won't need them. Either your level is enough no matter (his entire career), or it won't be enough no matter. I'm talking about pure monks. Get some Spell Focus Evocation instead, perhaps. If you drop Autoquicken, which you should not drop unless you get permahaste items or take travel domain, then you have enough feats for ESF: Evocation and GrWIS X. Ending Wis on 36 even with my starting abilities.<br><br>Nothing good comes from 36 WIS you say? You kidding? Wis in a caster cleric grants you more spells, better save and higher save DC for your spells. All those are very much needed in a caster build. I see no reason to have less than 36. Your save DC vs Implosion will be 41+ WIS buffs. SoV is also an Evoc spell, plus a few handy ones levelling up.<br><br>A pure Cleric is great, these are merely suggestions for playability, it works well no matter.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

There's one too many feats in this build and one too few ability increases.  You can count them.  Assuming that the OP meant to raise wisdom at level 40, this makes absolutely no difference in the resultant stats, but what it doesn't do is afford an extra ability point to be added.

Math ain't my strong suit, but I count a legit number of feats.  It just seems that he took a Great Wis at Level 40 instead of doing an ability increase, which is probably a typo more than anything.  Still think he's legit with the 36 Wis.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
