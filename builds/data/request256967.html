Hey im looking for a PVP build of this combo (bard/PM/rdd) i was thinking something along the lines of 14/16/10..<br><br>Hoping to get Epic Mage Armour and Warding <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> . Dont really want dev crit as everyone on the server i plays seems to be a PM! Hoping to use a katana seeing as i have 2 take a feat for a wep no matter what! Heavy armour and shield and normal melee stuff!<br><br>I dont really kno how to get the most out of this build as a melee char! I mean i can get fairly good ab and good ac (just cuz its a PM) but i was hoping somebody could post a build thats superior to mine - im sure there are many!<br><br>The server i play on hasnt had any nerfs on this build so it should be the same on it as in normal game!<br><br>Please help!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif"> <br><br>Thank you all!<br>_________________<br>Life's a B*tch, Wear a helmet!

Perhaps if you could be more specific on what you're looking for and what it is about those builds that doesn't meet your expectations, we could be a little more help.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

the one i like the most out of all of them is the grim bard thing! <br><br>But i consider it a bit pointless to take all those feats to get dev crit when on the server i play on 75% of the people are PMs. my main problem is not knowing when to take lvls and feats to get max bab pre epic to get all attacks per round. i think its 12 bard and 8 rdd but not 100% sure!<br><br>Also i was  a bit worried about death spells with this build... because i was going to sacrifice fort feats due to the fact that it being PM makes it immune to crits. Also how much perform do i need to get max bard song at that lvl? <br><br>I was thinking of taking the Grim Bard build and taking out the feats for Dev Crit and take curse song and armour earlier in order to take a couple of great str epic to make up for starting with 16 str...<br><br>But im no expert so dont really kno how to do that...<br><br>When i made my version i got this.....<br><br>Hitpoints: 487<br>Skillpoints: 209<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 24/23/19<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8<br>BAB: 25<br>AB (max, naked): 42 (melee), 25 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 33/44<br>Spell Casting: Bard(5)<br>Alignment Changes: 0<br><br>I had esf disc and EMA and Warding..... <br><br>But at the moment my PC is getting slowly fixed and so am making this on CBC so dont rly kno how itll perform.

If you like the Grim Bard, but you want it without Dev-Crit then read the Black Widow layout again and notice where it says <i>if you want it as a STR build, then...</i>. Basically, ditch Weapon finesse for Armor proficiency if you want to, and get still spell somewhere. You'll have an unbuffed AB of 42, which isn't that bad in a build that can buff nicely.<br><br>These days I'm convinced that a Bard20/RDD10/PM10 would make the strongest combo though.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

nice idea, its bard song is nicer, but it doesnt get many songs (unless u take more feats) and it doesnt get lasting inspiration so your going to be singing alot! I think that it would be better to get EMA which lasts a long time and then just save warding so that if you get to badly wounded you can really wind up you opponent! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">
