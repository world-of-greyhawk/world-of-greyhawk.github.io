Six – that's six – d20 attacks per round.  Seven with haste.  Circle kick adds one free attack to any surrounding foe for a successful hit, once per round.  <br>• Can set and craft traps. <br>• Decent fortitude and will saves, very good reflex.  Add +2 to all saves for 4 CoT levels. <br>• Improved Evasion.

If you are human, you can take fighter levels instead of Champion of Torm without incurring the experience penalty that this build avoids until level 36.  Close with maxing out rogue skills to taste after taking discipline to max at level 39.<br><br>There are two open feats (three if you don't think blinding speed is worth it given the haste items in the world).  You can take point blank shot and rapid shot for your range attack, or improved crit: longbow and another feat to taste (like dodge); or ambidexterity and two-weapon fighting for your kama weapon focus.  Or you can take Luck of Heroes at first level and push the rest of the feats back (add +1 to all saves) and then bolster your off-dexterity saves with iron will or fortitude.  The problem with that is that your monk abilities almost make will and fortitude saves moot by immunity and magic resistance.  I think I prefer dodge, improved crit: longbow, and blinding speed.<br><br>Good hunting.<br>_________________<br>We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender - Winston Churchill<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 06/25/05 14:02</span></i></p>

You could do this build evil very easily by substituting the CoT with Blackguard, very similar effect with some twists.  I go good.

Personally, I think dropping Epic Skill Focus: Discipline and Improved Sneak Attack I for Defensive Roll and Epic Dodge makes for a stronger character over all.  You're unlikely to need more discipline than you're getting from skill points alone, and Epic Dodge is an extremely powerful feat, allowing you to avoid the first hit scored each round completely.<br><br>Oh, and a minor point...this build as written only has 9d6 sneak, not 10d6.  8 from rogue levels plus 1 from Improved Sneak Attack I.<br><br>Steve

Just noticed a slightly more serious problem.  You can't take your first CoT level at level 10.  You need a BAB of +7 to take Cot.  A Monk(5)/Rogue(4) only has a BAB of +6.  You'll need to move one more monk level before the CoT levels and move your feats around accordingly.<br><br>Steve

You have to take Defensive Roll in there before you take Epic Dodge.  It's a pre-requisite.  You also need to have reached monk(9), as that gives you Improved Evasion, another pre-requisite for Epic Dodge (but your build already does that, so that's not a problem).  So, you'd need to take Defensive Roll at rogue(10) and then drop one of your later rogue bonus feats for Epic Dodge.  That's why I suggested replacing Epic Skill Focus: Discipline and Improved Sneak Attack with those two feats.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 06/07/05 01:24</span></i></p>

I see there are two other open feats; maybe take circle kick out and replace with the two weapon feats; and have a backup of Kama?  So you don't waste the focus taken for COT (agreed you sacrifice 3ab [1 from no epic focus, 2 from dualwield] but this gives you extra two attacks for higher hp attacks against those non-unarmed-attackable critters).  My bad point being, avoid circle kick if at all possible, especially if you expect to be up against mobs.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 06/07/05 16:51</span></i></p>

I hadn't noticed you had taken circle kick.  Circle Kick is bugged.  It actually makes a character weaker, because it causes you to lose your targeting and you end up having to keep redirecting your attacks, which causes you to lose attacks.  Anything would be better than Circle Kick.<br><br>Steve

Yes, Circle Kick should and must be dropped right away.  No self-respecting Monk takes that feat.  It won't be fixed until Patch 1.73.  And even then I would avoid it out of principle.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

And no circle kick.  Saves got 1 point worse for letting go of Luck of Heroes.  But that is actually okay because I have this build at Level 6 in the Badlands and (as you can see) I had gone with toughness, iirc.<br><br>Getting better all the time . . .<br><br>Thanks for the input, all.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Ithacan on 06/07/05 18:58</span></i></p>
