I didn't see this version listed on the builds page.  I've played this build and it's quite good.  The downside is definitely that Divine Might and Divine Shield take a while to cast and don't last long.<br><br>There are also a few inaccuracies with the build:<br>lvl 18 - Extra Smiting is not a CoT extra feat. I took Blind Fight.<br>lvl 20 - If you took Blind Fight at lvl 18, then you have to pick a CoT feat that's not part of the build.  I thought the best choices were Knockdown or Great Cleave (I took the later).<br>lvl 21 - You probably want to take Extra Smiting here instead of Great Charisma.  The thing is that all those Great Smite's won't matter if you can only use Smite once.<br><br>I wasn't sure about the Great Wisdom feats at lvl 22 and 24.  I think these are for the Cleric lvls that come much later (so you can cast 5th and 6th lvl spells I guess).  I would take them at lvl 28 and 32 instead and take Great Smite here instead.<br><br>The original build is posted here:<br><a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewpost.html?topic=348361&amp;post=2931961&amp;forum=77" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br>Herbie's Disciple of Torm, v3.0<br>Race: Human<br>Stats<br>Str 15 <br>Dex 8<br>Con 10 <br>Wis 14 <br>Int 12 <br>Cha 16<br>Increase Cha every four levels<br><br>Skills<br>You want to go for Discipline, Concentration, Spellcraft, cross class Tumble - any leftovers into Heal or Persuade or something.

So at the cost of one useless feat, a bit of re-jigging of the feats, and being stuck with level 4 Cleric spells for most of its levelling life, Disciple v3.0 gets +1 BAB, better saves, +2 AC, +40 HP and Blind Fight. Definitely worth it, huh?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 20:24</span></i></p>
