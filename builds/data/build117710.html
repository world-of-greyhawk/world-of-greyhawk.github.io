My game CD is in another state at this time, so being woefully out of touch atm, the only thing I can tell you is that unshifted and unbuffed, base AC is 26. (I think, unless I was calculating differently than I should have been. Cause it's at the top of the character details.)<br><br>I can tell you that playestyle-wise vs NPCs I heavily utilized the darkness via drider and drow forms (depending which I had unlimited uses of,) and sneak attacked things to oblivion. (Yay for level 1 ultravision.) AB varied GREATLY depending on weapon finesse or not (high dex character, didn't worry about high wisdom so didn't get the majority of the epic shifter forms,) and now I hear that that feat works on Creature form weapons? I don't think it used to, so I'd have to run some tests.<br>_________________<br><i><b>Shifter Goddess!</b> . . . <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=397983&amp;forum=42" target="_blank">Zelle's Shifter Details, Version V</a></i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ZelleQyllvan on 07/19/06 19:49</span></i></p>
