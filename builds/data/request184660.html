Hi everyone,<br><br>Never really been into shifter builds however I want to RP a Minotaur Barbarian. Not to sure how to go about building it. <br><br>I want to maximise on the Rage Feats, Damage reduction would be nice as well with weapon spec Great Axe. I would also like the heavy armour feat as well (does the armour bonuses shift with you?)<br><br>Will the rage work while shifted ?<br><br>Can anyone help me with this build as I'm not to sure where to start.<br><br>Thanks for any help you can offer.<br>_________________<br>Escape From Undermountain - A NWN Online Mod.<br><br>Find more Information about it <a href="http://www.ironworksforum.com/ubb/noncgi/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=8;t=000348" target="_blank">HERE</a>

Ok, first thing, break points for Minotaur shape<br>Shifter level 3: Greater Wildshape II.  This gets you the form 3 times a day.<br>level 7: Infinite GW II.  This lets you shift and de-shift as much as you want without resting.<br>level 11: Epic GW II.  Your minotaur form has improved HP,AC,stats.  Free knockdown feat.  d6 fire added to your axe.<br><br>Stats:<br>Minotaur form overrides your STR and CON.  So no point spending any points there.  Unless... you want the epic Rage feats.  Which is unfortunate, since even if your STR and CON are 40 each, they will drop back to 19/17 in minotaur form, Or 22/20 for epic minotaur.  And you'll lose the associated bonus HP from the loss of CON <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">     Also, you'll want at least a 13 WIS, so you can cast 3rd level spells.  You're going to have to take 5 levels of Druid before Shifter, so you might as well be able to cast  the spells.<br><br>Yes, Rage will work while shifted.  All the feats work, you just cant use items (wands, scrolls) or cast spells.  You can drink potions.  You can even cast Epic spells shifted, since they are really feats.<br><br>Alignment: Any neutral except lawful neutral<br><br>Feats:<br>All the Greataxe feats will work in minotaur form.  weapon focus, epic focus, imp crit, over crit, dev crit.  All the Rage feats will work, but you'll lose the stats while shifted.<br>However many Shifter levels you take.  Dont take more than 8 pre-epic.  Or you will lose your 4th attack.  So Druid 5/Shifter 8 or Druid 8/Shifter 8 and the rest Barbarian will get you your 4 attacks a round.  Obviously you can take fewer levels than 8, 8 is just the max.<br><br>Armor:<br>You do not get the armor rating when you shift.  You do get the highest magic AC modifier.  So +3 Plate,+2 boots of the sun soul, and a +1 cloak of protection will give you +3 to your minotaurs AC.  So heavy armor doesn't really help much unless it has some cool property you want.<br><br>Weapon:<br>When shifted into minotaur form you will merge your weapon property into the minotaurs axe, +1 enchant or +3 enchant d6 fire for the epic form.  Enchant bonuses do not stack, neither does fire.  So shifting holding a desert wind +1 (d6 fire) into epic minotaur will get you nothing.  But holding a leech dagger, +5 enchant +3 vampiric regen, will give your Epic minotaur a +5 great axe with d6 fire and +3 vampiric regen.<br><br>Items:<br>Gloves/Bracers do not merge. ever.  So it doesn't matter what you wear there.  And almost no properties will stack.  So two rings of STR +2 will give you just +2 shifted, not +4.  Same for +saves, x/- elemental resistance, etc.  Regen will stack.  So two rings of regen, +4 each, will give you +8 regen while shifted.<br><br>Finally there is a butt load of information on Shifters out there.  Search for the Shifter FAQ (a little outdated) in google and Zelle's Shifter thread on the main forums.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By King Ubu on 03/10/05 22:42</span></i></p>
