Am going to try a Bard/WM for a potential tank build for a PW.<br><br>Should I go for RDD levels or F levels to achieve that purpose?<br><br>With RDD I get some immunities and 8 STR (which amounts to, what, about 4 extra AB/Damage, right?).<br><br>With Fighter levels I get more AB and extra feats. And Epic Weapon Specialization which would give me 6 extra damage.  Which I think would essentially be like having an extra 12 STR, right?<br><br>Though with RDD levels and a 2H weapon I would still get better damage (with the extra STR and the 1.5X damage from the STR bonus, correct?)<br><br>What would u advise?<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Joe
