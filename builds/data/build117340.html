"The Thundering Barbarian"<br><br>Thoughts: After evaluation after re-evaluation, I came up with the *one* thing Barbarians have that makes them -somewhat- comparable to Dwarven Defender - Thundering Rage. Mighty Rage, as people may have noticed, is not worth it - it is the only barbarian ability that requires epic barbarian, and it is not even that much better than Greater Rage ability. Wanting to take advantage of Thundering Rage to its optimum, I expanded on this and made a Greatsword Weapon Master Thundering Raging Barbarian.<br><br>Human<br>---<br>16 STR<br>13 DEX<br>16 CON<br>13 INT<br>8 WIS<br>8 CHA<br><br>SKILLS: 4+INT modifier, +1 from human, +1 from int = 6 skills. However you will take weapon master and fighter levels; so don't plan for all 5! These are the skills you should take:<br>INTIMIDATE (on barbarian/weapon master levels), TUMBLE (cross-skill), DISCIPLINE (any), CONCENTRATION (fighter only), LISTEN (barbarian). If you don't want Terrifying Rage; don't take intimidate past 4 ranks and take something like Taunt instead.<br><br><br>Barbarian 1 - Power Attack, Cleave<br>Barbarian 1, Fighter 1 - Dodge<br>Barbarian 2, Fighter 1 - Mobility<br>Barbarian 2, Fighter 2 - *Con up (17)*, Spring Attack<br>Barbarian 4, Fighter 2 - Expertise<br>Barbarian 4, Fighter 4 - *Con up (18)*, Whirlwind Attack<br>Barbarian 5, Fighter 4 - Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>Barbarian 5, Fighter 4, Weapon Master 3 - *Con up (19)* Improved Critical: Greatsword<br>Barbarian 5, Fighter 5, Weapon Master 5 - Weapon Specialization: Greatsword (level 15 MUST be your fighter level)<br>Barbarian 5, Fighter 5, Weapon Master 6 - *Con up (20)*<br>Barbarian 6, Fighter 5, Weapon Master 7 - Great Cleave<br>Barbarian 8, Fighter 5, Weapon Master 7 - *Str up (17)*<br>---<br>Barbarian 8, Fighter 6, Weapon Master 7 - Great Constitution I (Con is 21!), Epic Damage Reduction I<br>Barbarian 8, Fighter 8, Weapon Master 7 - Epic Damage Reduction II<br>Barbarian 8, Fighter 9, Weapon Master 7 - *Str up (18)* Great Strength I (STR is 19)<br>Barbarian 8, Fighter 10, Weapon Master 7 - Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>Barbarian 8, Fighter 12, Weapon Master 7 - Epic Weapon Specialization: Greatsword, Great Strength II (STR is 20)<br>Barbarian 9, Fighter 12, Weapon Master 7 - *Str up (21)*<br>Barbarian 11, Fighter 12, Weapon Master 7 - Great Strength III (STR is 22)<br>Barbarian 13, Fighter 12, Weapon Master 7 - *Str up (23)*<br>Barbarian 14, Fighter 12, Weapon Master 7 - Great Strength IV (STR is 24)<br>Barbarian 14, Fighter 14, Weapon Master 7 - Overwhelming Critical: Greatsword<br>Barbarian 15, Fighter 14, Weapon Master 7 - *Str up (25)* Thundering Rage<br>Barbarian 15, Fighter 16, Weapon Master 7 - Devastating Critical: Greatsword<br>Barbarian 16, Fighter 16, Weapon Master 7 - Terrifying Rage<br>Barbarian 17, Fighter 16, Weapon Master 7 - *Str up (26) Or Con up (22)* (You can do Str up OR Con up)<br><br>End Result: A warrior with a moderate amount of DR (9/- with barbarian +3); a rage that scares enemies, a high critting fiend who on crit: *does 2d6 extra damage with a crit while raged* *forces enemy to make fort save or die* *50% of blindless/deafness on target* *does a whole lot of damage normally*<br><br>I guess this build would work for Conan too, but hehe.<br><br>Most of the time, dwarven defender &gt; barbarian... I think even this build doesn't compensate for this... but it is ok; but nothing compared to a well-built DwD. But who wants to be an ugly dwarf (especially when playing female chars)?<br><br>~ Lock.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/26/08 07:41</span></i></p>
