Wow, I was happy to see that Anuis still browses the forums making suggestions and such. I agree with the others like Avado in saying that Anuis is a great legend in these forums. <br><br>What I am asking is simple... For Anuis; please post your favourite build creation. And for any who have enjoyed those creations over the years, post your favourite Anuis build...<br><br>Basically I am simply suggesting a celebration of one of the legendary members of this guild. Perhaps a suggestion to the moderators..<br><br>"Can we put in another complete topic? One where people can post their favourite builds from all the wonderful builders in this guild. I personally have enjoyed many of the builds offered by those that took the time to research and post them. I think they should be given kudos for all their work. Is this a good idea?"<br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.

Ok... I'm going to start this off... I hope Anuis has another fav build because I might be stealin' the thunder but <i>I like the following one</i>:<br><br><br><br><b>******************************</b><br><br><br><br><b><i>Author: Anuis</i></b><br><br><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "240487", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Shadow Master (Ranger 21/Druid 10/Assassin 9)</a> <br><br><br> <br><i>Foreword</i><br>I have done a search on this combo and found that there were none... so I thought why not try this combination and see how it turns out... It seems to be a good, and playable, build. In this build, you get nice amount of spells, which is explained in detail below. Also, this build has decent hide/move silently skills, good amount of HPs and so on... anyway, on to the build.<br><br><i>Story</i><br>A dark night falls over a bustling town, even late in the night, it remains a hub for trades and all sorts of businesses which are conducted within the walls which are surrounded by thick forest apart from roads that leads to town.<br><br>Deep within the lush forest, lays a figure cloaked in darkness. Gazing through the eagle-like eyes, he spots two sentries stationed at the only open entrance into the town with four lit torches. Watching all activity surrounding the town and the only entrance… he spots a guard walking from behind the sentries… This guard was different; this one had distant markings on the armor, signifying a ranking far above the two guarding the gate. Perhaps this unique guard is a high guard commander? The marked guard spoke with authority to the sentries, giving them the orders for the night. The orders were to stand guard and let nothing to come in since there is an extremely important meeting to be undertaken between one of the rich families, which are of those who own the town, and some businessmen that seemed to be rough and dangerous. The commander left after giving the orders… the figure smiled and proceeded to move toward the edge of the forest. Just before he reached the edge, he paused a moment, he kneels over to the ground, inspecting the ground.<br><br>“Pathetic, real pathetic… they think they could keep me out with this measly trap... hah! I am going to leave them a shocker around here.” He said as he quietly chuckled to himself.<br><br>Once at the edge of the forest, the figure paused and wolf came alongside him, waiting for his orders… The owner gave signal and the wolf knew what to do. At the same moment as the wolf walked out, the figure moved. He passed a tree and the next second, he was gone... apart from new wolf that just walked front of the tree.<br><br>After the sentries accepted their orders and stood guard, a lone wolf approached the sentries from forest.<br><br>“Oooh, look at what we have here! A Wolf!” The left post guard exclaimed.<br><br>“Leave that dog or wolf alone, it could have rabies for all we know.” The right post guard said.<br><br>“Naw! It looks like it is hungry!” said the left guard as he looked at the wolf, “Here boy, aren’t you hungry?”<br><br>The left sentry tosses a meat that was packaged inside his pouch near where the wolf is. The wolf hungrily ate the meat, as it was eating the meat… a second wolf appeared. Excited at the sight of second wolf, left sentry proceeded to get another meat.<br><br>“Ah, second one! I am going to feed you in moment.” He tossed second meat, but the second wolf did not approach where the meat was thrown, instead it inched closer to the sentries.<br><br>The right sentry spoke, “There is something funny about this one…”<br><br>As if to confirm the sentry’s suspicions, the wolf body started to rip and shred itself apart, a horrible ripping sound of flesh made the one that was feeding the wolf to vomit violently. A form of man appeared where the wolf once stood, “Nice of you to feed my wolf… and now you must die.” Quick as he was, both guards were subdued to silence before they could utter a syllable. “However, your time is not up yet… but soon it will be.”<br><br>The mysterious man disappeared into the shadows and crept into the town unopposed and quietly… A guard doing his routine inside the town, minding his own business, bumped into a cloaked figure.<br><br>The cloaked figure spoke, “Pardon me master. I was not watching where I was going.”<br><br>The guard barked back, “Watch where you are going next time!” The guard bumped into the man hard as if to warn him. The humble man looked back and smiled evilly and resumed his wandering as the guard walked the opposite direction. Few seconds later, the guard started to think, “I don’t recognize that man…” He turned around to stop him and to see who he was, but the man was nowhere to be seen. The guard started to feel uneasy.<br><br>After finding his target, the cloaked figure stopped and readied himself for the upcoming battle. He entered into the shadows, shrouding himself with darkness. Remaining inside shadows, he searches out for his primary target. Inside the room just ahead of him, it was full of the businessmen of ruthless origins but none of the families which suited his purpose just fine. He would rather to keep them out and deal with the ones that were here now.<br><br>The businessmen talked amongst themselves… unaware of man in shadows, watching them, and waiting for the right moment.<br><br>“Where the hell are those stupid people? I have got things to do and killing to do!” said one of the men.<br><br>A woman barked, “Shut up stupid, we just have to bide ourselves. Just wait patiently and we will deal with them as we have others.”<br><br>All men crackled and immediately the room became dark, black as moonless night. Everyone stood up and stood guard, panic overtaking them.<br><br>“What the hell?”<br><br>“What is this?! Are they attacking us?!?”<br><br>“Ah! Something got me!”<br><br>“Shut up idiot, that was me. There is something in here with us… be quiet.”<br><br>The shadow peered into the darkness, scanning thoroughly for all targets that are in the room… he found good vulnerable spot to appear and do his job. He dropped from the ceiling into the center of the room, breaking the table that the businessmen were sitting around.<br><br>“AHH…. Gurgle….” Someone was about to scream but was choking on his own blood.<br><br>Afraid of the shadow, the group stabbed wildly at random spots in the darkness, hoping to draw a bit of blood or kill whoever was in there.<br><br>Meanwhile, the commander approached where the sentries were slumped over, assuming that they were sleeping on their duty… he proceeded to smack the right sentry. The sentry bowled over, seemly dead… but at closer glance, he was still breathing, just merely knocked out. At his grimace, the high guard proceeded to sound the alarm… but someone beat him to it by loud scream that echoed throughout the town.<br><br>“Damn, I left one alive enough to scream.” The assassin cursed as he killed the woman, apparently the leader of this group.<br><br>All guards that were within the hearing distance of scream converged onto the building where the deal was supposed to go down. Dozens of guards ran through the hallway and quickly they froze in their path… seeing darkness emanating from the room. Afraid of evil that may lies within… but more afraid of the families who owned the town, they slowly crept into the room, hoping to cut off any means of escape for whatever or whoever may still be in there. Once they entered, the darkness disappeared and the murderer stood in the center, cloaked in shadows… The guards noticed the dead bodies a skewed all around the room. All poised themselves to capture the man who appeared out of the shadows. They closed in, but as quickly as he appeared, he disappeared so fast that the papers flew, following the wind of escaping shadow master. The guards gasped at the speed of the man... they couldn't follow even if they dared.<br><br>Later that evening, far into the forest… the shadow master weaved between trees, covering his tracks. However, the high guard was waiting for him in the wide-open clearing. “I see that you were successful at escaping my guards… but you wouldn’t be as fortunate with me.”<br><br>“Hahaha! I wouldn’t be so sure of that guard... And I see that you survived the trap… quite a shocker wasn’t it?” He laughed aloud.<br><br>The two launched themselves at each others, clashing swords, sparks flying everywhere… When they faced each other, holding off the attacks with their own weapons, the shadow master bared his teeth and growled at commander. Immediately the guard backed off and called in for backup that were hiding in the forest. They all were of different races, variety of fighters, wizards and so forth… They converged on the Shadow Master. At same time, the commander changed his weapon, weapon that was fashioned for the high guard only. As quick as the backup appeared, they were struck down with hatred and fury of Shadow Master. The guard stood, holding new weapon, however it was useless due to that the assassin managed to knock it out of his hand before he could put it to use. But there was one thing that master did that shocked guard to his core, he picked up the weapon.<br><br>“You can’t do that! You shouldn’t be even holding it!”<br><br>“Haha! You are a fool, I wouldn’t dare to come in and do the job unless I was thoroughly prepared! Prepare to die by your own weapon!”<br><br>The assassin moved so swiftly, beyond the range of that the eyes can see. The sword plunged into the flesh of the guard… gouging the flesh and meat out through the back.<br><br>Gasping, the guard falls to his knee… “How are you able to…” Before he could finish his question, he sagged dead with sword sticking inside. Shadow Master smiled and left...<br><br>“Why do we tolerate this evil?” said one of the hiding druid.<br><br>"He is a necessity evil, we only tolerate him because he gets the job done and he protects us from ‘Others’." Another druid said as he sets off to return to his group. <br><br>Story © By Anuis AKA J.M.B.<br><br><br><br><i>Character</i><br><br><br>Shadow Master<br><br>Ranger 21/Druid 10/Assassin 9<br><br>Race: Human<br>Starting Class: Ranger<br>Alignment: Neutral Evil<br>Abilities:<br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 16 - 26<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 15 - 16<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Skill<br>Discipline - 42<br>Hide - 43(63)<br>Move Silently - 43(63)<br>Spellcraft - 38(40)<br>Tumble - 40(48)<br>Use Magic Device - 41(40)<br><br>Disable Traps - 12(16)<br>Set Traps - 35(45)<br>Open Locks - 7(15)<br><br>0 left over.<br><br>Final Stats:<br>AC: 28 (10 Natural + 8 Dex Mod + 8 Tumble Mod + 2 Armor Skin)<br>HP: 424/424<br><br>MW: Unarmed / Handaxe / 2 Handaxe<br>AB: +37/+32/+27/+22 / +40/+45/+30/+25 / +38/+33/+28/+23<br>Dam: 1-3(Critical: 20/x2) / 1-6(Critical: 19-20/x3) / ""<br>OW: NA / NA / Handaxe<br>AB: NA / NA / +38/+33<br>Dam: NA / NA / 1-6(Critical: 19-20/x3)<br>Fort: 25<br>Reflex: 24<br>Will: 23<br>BA: 28<br><br>Level Layout:<br>lvl 1: Ranger 1 - FE: Humans **, Toughness, Weapon Finesse<br>lvl 2: Druid(1)<br>lvl 3: Druid(2) - Weapon Focus (Handaxe)<br>lvl 4: Ranger(2) - Dex +1 (Dex 17)<br>lvl 5: Druid(3)<br>lvl 6: Druid(4) - Knockdown<br>lvl 7: Ranger(3)<br>lvl 8: Druid(5) - Dex +1 (Dex 18)<br>lvl 9: Druid(6) - Improved Knockdown<br>lvl 10: Ranger(4)<br>lvl 11: Druid(7)<br>lvl 12: Druid(8) - Improved Critical (Handaxe), Dex +1 (Dex 19)<br>lvl 13: Ranger(5) - FE: Half-Elves **<br>lvl 14: Ranger(6)<br>lvl 15: Ranger(7) - Stealthy<br>lvl 16: Ranger(8) - Dex +1 (Dex 20)<br>lvl 17: Ranger(9)<br>lvl 18: Ranger(10) - Blind-Fight, FE: Dwarves **<br>lvl 19: Ranger(11)<br>lvl 20: Ranger(12) - Dex +1 (Dex 21) <br>lvl 21: Druid(9) - Epic Weapon Focus (Handaxe)<br>lvl 22: Assassin(1)<br>lvl 23: Assassin(2)<br>lvl 24: Ranger(13) - Epic Prowess, Dex +1 (Dex 22)<br>lvl 25: Ranger(14)<br>lvl 26: Ranger(15) - FE: Halflings **<br>lvl 27: Assassin(3) - Great Dexterity I (Dex 23)<br>lvl 28: Assassin(4) - Dex +1 (Dex 24)<br>lvl 29: Ranger(16)<br>lvl 30: Ranger(17) - Epic Skill Focus (Hide) ++<br>lvl 31: Assassin(5)<br>lvl 32: Assassin(6) - Dex +1 (Dex 25)<br>lvl 33: Ranger(18) - Epic Skill Focus (Move Silently) ++<br>lvl 34: Ranger(19)<br>lvl 35: Ranger(20) - FE: Half-Orcs **<br>lvl 36: Assassin(7) - Armor Skin, Dex +1 (Dex 26)<br>lvl 37: Assassin(8)<br>lvl 38: Druid(10)<br>lvl 39: Ranger(21) - Bane of Enemies<br>lvl 40: Assassin(9) - Wis +1 (Wis 16)<br><br>Leveling up Notes:<br>** Can change favored enemy to your own taste.<br>++ Can replace this with Great Dexterity<br><br>NOTES:<br>The reason for taking many druid levels is that it allows you to level up your familiar so you are able to distract other opponents whenever necessary in early stage of character's life. Also it is to get you some shape changes soon as possible.<br><br>Also, reason for holding off on taking Assassin is that I wanted to maximize AB much as possible. There are many benefits of taking druid levels. Also, by taking assassin levels, you get nice benefit of being able to have UMD skill.<br><br>Spell Notes:<br>Druid Spell #<br>Cantrips - 6<br>1 - 5<br>2 - 5<br>3 - 4<br>4 - 3<br>5 - 2<br><br>Ranger Spell #<br>1 - 4<br>2 - 4<br>3 - 4<br>4 - 3<br><br>In combination of all Ranger and Druid spells, you can easily have a lot of spells in your arsenal. If you were to select one spell each, you could end up with 40 spells!<br><br>Recommendations: It would be best to select most of the spell that will improve your hide and move silently skills enabling you to be able to sneak with no problem and kill many opponents as possible. It is also recommended that you use spells that can hinder your opponent's movement or any form of harm that can help you with your opponents. There are many spells to choose from, there are some ranger and druid spells that are same, so that can easily free up your spell slot if you want to have more spells, or have more same spells.<br><br>Misc Notes:<br>If you wanted to... you can do the same as what the assassin did in story above.... send in companion(with same name as your character) and follow at same time... this may throw off some of your opponents. But this would only work if they do not check your character's description.<br><br>Anyway, aside from above... it is possible to boost the move silently and hide skills by additional 3 points, just have to replace two feats and replace them with skill focus(move silently/hide), perhaps Improved Knockdown and Blind-Fight feat.<br><br>Also, since you have 41(40) UMD skill points, you should be able to use pretty much all classes spells(from scrolls) and restricted items which you can use to boost your other skills or stats even more. Such as Keen Edge, Darkfire, Meteor Swarm, Gloves of the Hin Fist +4, and so on...<br><br>Thanks goes to Kail for helping me to fine tune this build. Any suggestions that would improve this build even more is welcome. Also, let me know what you think of the story as well...  <br><br>Anuis<br><br>EDIT: Discovered mistake with class levels... corrected it.

Thanks Kail. It's good to see you still active too. Yes, Mick I'm aware Anuis started this very guild and is the creator. But what is the guild about? Epic Character Builds. <br><br>The sad thing is that so many of the most active members have left the game because face it, NWN is OLD.. I still maintain that it is the most customizable game out there with so much rich content developed by the PLAYERS of the game. That part itself makes it difficult to let the game go from my perspective.<br><br>I am relatively new as a member of this guild but have been a fan for a long time. I have not made a ton of posts, I have only submitted one or two builds myself but I am no build expert either. This was simply a NOOB post which could have been done better. Encouragement on Kail's part is better than negativity on Avado's. <br><br>There's all those creative minds out there that have contributed to many...many... superb servers over the years, awesome builds, great rp, scripting, and haks that continue to transform the game.. And hey I think it should be celebrated.<br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.

Thing is, I don't really see the point in re-posting any builds.  They're already there in all their glory, but for the asking.  Last thing the internets needs is farther replication of the same data.  Just sayin'.  If you wanted to discuss a particular builder's style, then I can see something thread-worthy, but just to repeat already posted builds?  *shrugs*

It was designed to get something useful out of posting a build that was posted years ago.  You like this build?  Why?  What is it about this build that you LOVE?  You didnt say anything about it.  All you did was tell us how cool you think it is to see Anuis post.   Personally, i dont care too much for this build.  Besides the unusual mix of classes, i wouldnt ever think twice about building it.  Your post got me interested, and ALL you did was rehash what was already posted by the man.  I am still confused as to what YOU see in this build.  Enlighten me!<br><br>For the record, my fav Anuis build isnt posted!  We discussed it over a few weeks months ago, and it was a great idea.

Threads don't get deleted.  You can just let it die a slow, painless, death, <i>or</i> you can make it worthwhile by telling us, as Avado suggests, <i>why</i> you like this build.  Personally, I would be interested in that.  At the very least, it would give this thread meaning.<br><br>Also, I think it's kinda funny that you saw negativity in Avado's post, which was meant to be positive, and encouragement in Kail's post...

Theme is the operative word, a ranger who embraces the ways of a ranger but has become an assassin. He utilizes the abilities of his ranger knowledge to contribute to his assassin profession, including his wolf companion. This is a ranger theme I have not used personally and I liked how Anuis did it in both build and in his story.<br><br>The build offers an interesting roleplaying concept and is versatile enough to survive the levelling process to the point that it has the classes attached that make its roleplay value more genuine in feel as well.<br><br>Appart from all the babbling about me appearing to try and "steal" someone's build because I inadequately posted it; Kail's post addressed the problem by making an edit to my post (obviously he could see that all it needed was some more clear credit to the author and that I was not trying to steal anyone's build); while Avado's just kept telling me what I had done wrong and has a condescending tone.<br><br> Just how many members have quit posting altogether because when they ask something, perhaps it isn't worded quite right; and they get persecuted by the peanut gallery? Or perhaps they post a build, and don't quite understand how the feats might be used more effectively and get a snotty answer. Perhaps some people should reconsider the meaning of the words "constructive criticism". <br><br>I am not targetting the above totally at Avado; please understand that. Avado has his days when he seems impatient with a "noob" but the bulk of his advice is constructive. I am just choosing this particular situation to say how I have noticed upon perusing these forums that sometimes someone tries to contribute, perhaps doesn't do a perfect job of it and the critique is less than friendly. I thought the idea of the guild was to encourage ideas, and then work on them together.<br><br>My thought on starting this topic was simply one thing. There are some builders/contributors/and idea people who are NO LONGER ACTIVE or AS ACTIVE in this guild while new people are still joining it. The new members should be aware of the wealth of work done here, and not just by using the character build searcher. I think of why I joined this guild and remember the names like Grim, Mithrades, Grizz, Anuis, Avado, Thax, Kail, Cin, Tyr, Ith, and many more. (too many good builders to mention), and then I think of new members and what they can contribute and perhaps breath life into a game that is in its twighlight. <br><br> I am now done with this topic *feeds it sleeping pills and wishes it a quiet rest*... ;zzz:<br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.

Guys, settle down...<br><br>Anyway, in response to the original poster. I am not a legend... there are many who are, in fact, a better builder than I am. I am just a normal builder who likes to play at maximum efficiency and such... so I am not legend, just a normal player.<br><br>Anyway, as to my favorite build... It is the correct version of Wrathful Berserker (named Bloodlust). But really, anything with Barbarian class is my favorite, along with any p-classes that are barbarian in some form. I even have one barbarian that can terrify and HiPS at same time... heh. *boo and hides*<br><br>Anyway... The correct version ended with STR of 30, with a loss of 20 HP to overall HPs(ended at 624 instead 644). Fort at 27(1 pt above the WB), and loss of 2 Will, but reflex remained the same. AB also was increased by 1, ending at 44 AB. Oh, and the AC increased to 18 from 16(which WB ended at).<br><br>The correct version also had higher intelligence, ie; more skillsets and had eh 24 extra left over after putting them into Discipline, Intimidate, Listen, Taunt and Tumble.<br><br>As in regards for feats, Iron Will, Improved Power Attack, Epic Toughness I and Thundering Rage were dropped in favor of something better. In the correct version, it has Blind Fight in pre-epic, and in post epic, Armor Skin and 2 additional Great Strengths. Well Armor Skin could be dropped for Epic Toughness I, but that's up to anyone.<br><br>So... Bloodlust is my favorite character. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  I guess I should post the correct version of Wrathful Berserker, ie; Bloodlust, at some point.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.

Sweet Anuis, that's the kind of answer I was hoping to see from you. I like that build, a true to form barbarian with some soldier training (fighter). Nice balance for a pure melee as he's got a good amount of skill points too.<br><br>You didn't fit in any tumble dump classes but his ac is still decent. Thanks very much for posting this one.<br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.
