On the srver i play on(legascy of Illmara),the Owner and myaelf have been discussing a request only race of Faerie,using the Elf as a base instead of the usual halfling.The following modifiers would apply.-4 str,+8 dex,-4 con,+1 int,+2 cha.could some one help me with a build for a Ranger/rogue,with poss sd 1lvl or Cot added?Preff. using a longsword /scimiter,Bow,poss spear.Sheild or small weapon in offhand?No cleric /monk/wiz lvls allowed,or Rdd/PM at epic.Im looking for an archer /rogue type with some minimal magic,s just to dissapear really.Really looking forward to seeing what you people come up with! I only discovered this guild by accident looked at some of Ciinabar,s rogue builds an now my Rogue really kicks butt! Jade <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

With those stat adjustments, and since you're thinking primarily archer, you're really constrained to using finesse weapons for melee. Otherwise your AB will suck completely. This is going to take longswords, spears, and scimitars out of the equation.<br><br>As for the build itself is this a level 40 build you're looking for? If so, I'd probably look at something like RGR 23/Rogue 16/SD 1. This gets you HiPS, 1 Ranger bonus feat, enough RGR for Bane of Enemies, at least 5 favored enemies, 8d6 sneak attack for extra damage, and enough Rogue levels to grab Epic Dodge.<br><br>Glad to hear you got some good results by looking at my builds. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Base starting stats before your 30 point buy would be:<br><br>STR 4<br>DEX 16<br>CON 4<br>INT 9<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 10<br><br>So, with the point buy involved, you could start with (cost in brackets):<br><br>STR 10 (6 points) &lt;- you don't want a negative modifier on your damage, and you want to be able to carry something.<br>DEX 24 (10 points)<br>CON 10 (6 points) &lt;- I figure you don't want a negative modifier here either.<br>INT 12 (3 points) &lt;- if you don't need the extra skill points, you could drop this to 10 and use the extra 2 elsewhere. Or maybe just shave one point off here and set WIS to 14 at the start.<br>WIS 13 (5 points) &lt;- This assumes you want access to all levels of RGR spells (see note below). If you only want up to level 2 spells, you can save yourself a point to put elsewhere.<br>CHA 10<br><br>Raise WIS where you need to in the build to get your level 4 spells, and put the rest into DEX. Should be easily able to get to 36 DEX without any buffs/gear (9 ability raises and 3 Grt DEX. This leaves 4 general feats for things like Armor Skin, Epic Prowess, Epic Weapon Focus, and Epic Dodge).<br><br>This is just rough and off the top of my head. Hopefully someone else can chime in and give you some better ideas, but maybe this will be a good starting point.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
