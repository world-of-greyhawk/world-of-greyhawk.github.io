First off - I have never played a bard.<br><br>I am wondering what the merits would be to playing a bard?  I did a search and 279 bard combinations came up.<br><br>I am not looking for the "best bard" I am seeking the wisdom of the guild to educate myself (and I hope others) in this class.<br><br>Points to ponder <br>1) spell selection<br>2) Other classes that mesh with Bard<br>3) Lots of levels or light on levels<br>4) Is it a support class only<br><br>I am probably rambling but I am curious and just would like to hear from others.

Here's what I once said.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;I'm in love the with whole concept of the Bard Class. I mean, you can buff yourself with Spells and your own Singing. You can cripple your enemies with Curse Song. You have - in my honest opinion - the best skillset (Concentration, Discipline, Tumble, Spellcraft, UMD, woot!) in the game. On top of that, you get the half-warrior AB so your basic hack'n'slash abilities aren't too bad either -- I'd say the only downside is the mere d6 hit die.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>That's obviously a very short and simple explanation but includes all the main points of the Bard class, I'd think. Bards are great <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  Anyway, on to your questions.<br><br>1) the Bard's most important spells, IMO, are the ones on levels 1-4, which include<br><br>Buffs:<br><br>Level 1<br>--<br>Mage Armor<br>Identify (dunno, it's utility maybe but it buffs your Lore <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> )<br>Protection from Alignment<br><br>Level 2<br>--<br>Bull's STR<br>Cat's Grace<br>Eagle's Splendour<br>Fox's Cunning<br>Ghostly Visage (at low levels)<br>Owl's Wisdom<br>Darkness (castable in armor to allow a retreat when your enemies cannot see)<br>Ultravision (combine with Darkness)<br>Invisibility<br>See Invisibility (usability depends on setting)<br><br>Level 3<br>--<br>Clairaudience/Clairvoyance (usability depends on setting<br>Displacement (a fine substitute until you get II)<br>Find Traps (usability depends on setting; especially good for soloing)<br>GMW<br>Haste<br>Invisibility Sphere<br>Keen Edge<br>Magic Circle against Alignment<br>Remove Curse (usability depends on setting; especially good for soloing)<br>Remove Disease (usability depends on setting; especially good for soloing)<br>Wounding Whispers (a very good damage shield)<br><br>Level 4<br>--<br>II<br>War Cry<br><br>the later spells aren't all that great, IMHO, but not bad either. I usually tend to use the later slots for metamagic (if I even have those slots).<br><br>2) Bard multiclasses well with many classes. An obvious example is Blackguard (CHA synergy). Generally, the Bard's skill set itself is often a good reason to multiclass with any class, and most fighting classes benefit from the Bard's abilities (especially in a low magic setting) -- not to mention gaining access to RDD <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>3) I think that 12 levels is fair enough if you want some decent use for your Bard/Curse song. The general consensus is that Bard 16 is gives you the best song for a reasonable skill point investment (30 points). It also gives you enough spell slots for the important buffs. That's generally a good level to end at, and does not hinder your other class' abilities too much. Another level is 20, which allows you to get Lasting Inspiration. Beyond that, you need insane Perform scores. However, some 26 levels is still reasonable with Skill Focus: Perform feat and such, check Cinnabar's Skillful Minstrel (ahh, still my favourite build ever!).<br><br>4) Certainly not! It's very good for soloing, even; at least in low magic. No party will turn down a Bard, though, that's for sure! But a well-built Bard can function in the front line, or plonk arrows very effectively. Good support but not limited to that.<br><br><br><br>Hmm, I hope my points are reasonable.<br>_________________<br>"And one calculates <i>time</i> from the <i>dies nefastus</i> on which this fatality arose – from the <i>first</i> day of Christianity! – <i>Why not rather from its last?</i> – <i>From today?</i> – Revaluation of all values!"

Bard merits:<br>Song/Curse song combo can be very powerful.<br>Good skill selection: Discipline, Tumble, UMD<br>Can use arcane scrolls, wands, rods, etc., even without UMD.<br>Can cast good buffing spells, some offensive spells.<br>Gains access to RDD, allowing them to get significant melee power boost.<br><br>As a more or less pure bard, they tend to be mostly support, singing and buffing the party. Can do alright in melee, but not great without some levels of a melee class.<br><br>A Fighter/Bard/RDD can be the main tank of the party, getting AB equal to a pure fighter when you count the Str bonus, plus having the bard songs and buffs. With songs and buffs, they can match a Fighter/WM build's AB. The Str boost lets them get Dev Crit earlier than anyone else.<br><br>Spell selection: somewhat module dependent (i.e. haste is a must if no perma-haste items available, but fairly useless if they are). <br><br>Warcry, Ice Storm and Dirge are useful offensively. Balgarn's Iron Horn can be useful in certain situations. Darkness/Ultravision combo is good. Imp Invis, ability buffs, energy buffer, etc. are all useful. GMW may be depending on magic level available. Healing spells may be useful depending on whether you have a cleric in the party and how available healing potions are.<br><br>Does that help?<br><br>TM

TM, you forgot to put Spellcraft, Concentration and Taunt in your skill selection <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>I forgot to say a Bard also qualifies for AA and PM.<br>_________________<br>"And one calculates <i>time</i> from the <i>dies nefastus</i> on which this fatality arose – from the <i>first</i> day of Christianity! – <i>Why not rather from its last?</i> – <i>From today?</i> – Revaluation of all values!"

Let's see, I generally use low amount of Bard levels for AA or something, so you should know for instance, that the Bard's Song can actually cover the BAB loss, or a perfect increase if you take Bard levels in epic.... what's the full song power? +2 AB, +3 Damage, +3 Will, +2 Fortitude, +2 Reflex, +4 to all skills, +20 HP, +5 Dodge Armor (level 16 according to my booklet).<br><br>Bards for skilldump are also cool, as stated before, great skills.<br><br>Yeah, good buffs.<br><br>I really don't believe that a "class" has a single or supportive action, all classes work in single and in supportive, depending on how it is based and built.
