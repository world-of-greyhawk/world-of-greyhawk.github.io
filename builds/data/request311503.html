I could use some help from the forum with a build I've been thinking about.  I want to make a pure-as-possible assassin with starting class rogue.<br><br>Here are my must haves:<br>Halfling<br>Rogue/Assassin 5/35<br>Shortbow main wep<br><br>I know that my character will not end up as powerful as it could be but to me RP and themeatics are more important.  I never liked those Heinz 57 Sauce builds with a little of this and a little of that.  With that being said, I want him to be as powerful as he can be within my list of criterion.  Anybody care to brainstorm with me on stats/skills distribution to make this guy the most he can be?

Well the minimum Rogue is 10 because you have to have 20 total levels before you take your 11th Assassin level. That's okay though because then you get Crippling Strike.<br><br>Stats:<br><br>STR: 8<br>DEX: 20<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>That would mean 310 skill points. Enough for about seven skills. Maybe Hide, MS, Tumble, UMD, Open Lock, Disable Trap, and Search.

What do you think the optimal class/level progression would be?

It's best to take those two classes in groups of four to prevent loss of BAB. Eight Rogue, then 12 Assassin. 21 and 22 can be Rogue to get Crippling Strike soonest but after 20 you can do whatever you want and not lose BAB.

Epic Dodge &gt; crippling Strike and most everything else the Rogue levels could give instead.<br><br>Rogue13/Asn27 would be good, for 12/8 Pre-Epic. I'd even make it Rog13/SD1/Asn26. If you think 1 lvl SD is bad rp, then please rethink it until you change your mind about that. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

Ranger/assassin, you get 4 attacks, dual weapon feats, bonus spells and feats for sneaking in nature for free.  If you want to make sure you are always hiding, then pop in 1 SD.  If you want epic dodge, then take 5 SD so that you have defensive roll.<br><br>6 ranger/4 SD/10 assassin preepic gets you 16 BAB for your 4 attacks per round.  Take 1 more SD at 21 and then the rest are assassin.  If you want, take more ranger in epic for discipline dumps.  Either way, 29 assassin gets you 15d6 sneak attack.  After that, just take improved sneak attack for more damage or epic skill focuses in hide/MS to make sure no one will ever find you.  And make sure to take epic dodge.

I don't think Ranger below 21 is worth aiming for in most cases.

Forgot all about the evasion.  I always just combined monk with SD.  Hehe.

It is the only full BAB class that get the stealth skills as class skills and can qualify for assassin at lvl 5 with a full BAB +5. And since you only can have 10 assassin lvls pre epic, there is room for enough ranger levels to get the dual wield feats. In such a build there is also room for 2 lvls of SD that give you HIPS and evasion.<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "295415", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Here</a> is one way to do it.<br><br>edit:typo<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 08/24/09 12:38</span></i></p>

Hell, on my server they implemented 3.5 edition rules for ranger so rangers get HiPS at level 17, evasion somewhere and some other minor tweaks.  Then they neglected to make the rest of the classes 3.5 for some reason.... oh well.<br><br>Either way, nice build you linked up.  That's pretty good BAB with HiPS.
