Build request for a...<br><br>***Two-Weapon Fighting Weapon Master***<br><br>...with the following ideas in mind:<br><br>-Reason for the character: It's just simply the best kind of character I can think of that I really enjoy playing this game with.  I thought I could get some help on here.<br><br>-Human Male.  Just saying this to help give you an exact idea of what I'm looking for.<br><br>-Lawful Good.<br><br>-One of these blades: Shortsword, Bastard sword, Longsword, Rapier, Scimitar.<br><br>-Fun moves (I like using "special moves/combat maneuvers" in battle, it's really what makes me have a good time in this game, instead of just click and attack.<br><br>-Playable from level 1 - 40<br><br>-Some moves I like using frequently (to help possibly decide for an "improved" feat:<br>*Whirlwind Attack<br>*Knockdown<br>*Power Attack<br>*Cleave Cleave Cleave SHWING!<br>*Parry<br><br>Would there be a way to go mostly Dexterity on this?<br>Since I'm looking through feats and noticing that I like a lot of Dex-required feats much more.  Strength is okay, though.<br><br>Other notes:<br>-Don't really care about critical hits, I hate it when monsters are immune to them.  But if there is a way to fit them in, that's cool.<br><br>Hey, I don't know how crazy my request is, whether it's incredibly difficult to come up with a build for it, or whether it's a no-brainer, but I thought posting a request might just help me out.  So thanks to anyone who can help.  Really appreciate it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

You don't care about criticals? it's about the main point on Weapon Masters...<br><br>Oh well, I'd play a Fighter 10 / Monk 2 / Weapon Master 28 because I like dual-wielding kamas and having max APR... however, for a DEX based a better choice might be Fighter 8 / Shadowdancer 10 / Weapon Master 22 and take Epic Dodge.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/05/08 02:23</span></i></p>

Based on your description of how you like to play, I concluded that you would enjoy a Rogue. Here's a build that gives you everything you asked for except for Parry, which is universally considered useless.<br><br>This is the first build I have posted that's generated by that spreadsheet. In Open Office, it apparently can't handle Weapon Master properly. As soon as I started taking WM levels, it no longer could calculate an AB.<br><br>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br><br><b>Dual Master (Rogue 17, Fighter 16, Weapon Master 7)</b><br>Playable from 1 - 40<br><i>Any Alignment, PvM</i><br><br>Human: (Quick to Master)<br>01: Rogue(1): Ambidexterity, Two-Weapon Fighting<br>02: Rogue(2): {Evasion}<br>03: Fighter(1): Blind Fight, Weapon Finesse<br>04: Fighter(2): DEX+1, Weapon Focus: Shortsword, (DEX=17)<br>05: Fighter(3)<br>06: Fighter(4): Knockdown, Weapon Specialization: Shortsword<br>07: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>08: Fighter(5): DEX+1, (DEX=18)<br>09: Fighter(6): Power Attack, Cleave<br>10: Fighter(7)<br>11: Fighter(8): Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>12: Rogue(4): DEX+1, Great Cleave, (DEX=19)<br>13: Fighter(9)<br>14: Fighter(10): Dodge<br>15: Fighter(11): Mobility<br>16: Fighter(12): DEX+1, Spring Attack, (DEX=20)<br>17: Rogue(5)<br>18: Fighter(13): Expertise<br>19: Fighter(14): Whirlwind Attack<br>20: Rogue(6): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br>21: Fighter(15): Epic Weapon Focus: Shortsword<br>22: Rogue(7)<br>23: Fighter(16): Epic Weapon Specialization: Shortsword<br>24: Weapon Master(1): DEX+1, Epic Prowess, Weapon of Choice: Shortsword, (DEX=22)<br>25: Weapon Master(2)<br>26: Weapon Master(3)<br>27: Rogue(8): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=23)<br>28: Weapon Master(4): DEX+1, (DEX=24)<br>29: Weapon Master(5)<br>30: Weapon Master(6): Armor Skin<br>31: Weapon Master(7)<br>32: Rogue(9): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br>33: Rogue(10): Improved Whirlwind Attack, Improved Evasion<br>34: Rogue(11)<br>35: Rogue(12)<br>36: Rogue(13): DEX+1, Epic Dodge, Defensive Roll, (DEX=26)<br>37: Rogue(14)<br>38: Rogue(15)<br>39: Rogue(16): Great Dexterity II, Crippling Strike, (DEX=27)<br>40: Rogue(17): DEX+1, (DEX=28)<br><br>Rogue(17), Fighter(16), Weapon Master(7), Human<br><br>STR: 14<br>DEX: 16 (28)<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 10<br><br>Hitpoints: 412<br>Skillpoints: 335<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 23/15/28<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Traps: +4<br>BAB: 28<br>0<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 29/32<br>Spell Casting: <br>Alignment Changes: 0<br><br>Disable Trap 43(47), Hide 43(52), Intimidate 4(4), Lore 20(22), Move Silently 43(52), Open Lock 43(52), Search 40(42), Set Trap 34(45), Tumble 40(49), UMD 25(25)<br><br><br>01: Disable Trap(4), Hide(4), Lore(3), Move Silently(4), Open Lock(4), Search(4), Set Trap(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(9), <br>02: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(12), <br>03: Save(17), <br>04: Save(22), <br>05: Save(27), <br>06: Save(32), <br>07: Disable Trap(5), Hide(5), Move Silently(5), Open Lock(5), Search(5), Set Trap(5), Tumble(5), UMD(5), Save(3), <br>08: Save(8), <br>09: Save(13), <br>10: Save(18), <br>11: Save(23), <br>12: Disable Trap(5), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Open Lock(5), Search(5), Set Trap(5), Tumble(5), UMD(5), <br>13: Save(5), <br>14: Save(10), <br>15: Save(15), <br>16: Save(20), <br>17: Disable Trap(5), Open Lock(5), Search(5), Set Trap(5), Tumble(5), UMD(5), Save(1), <br>18: Save(6), <br>19: Save(11), <br>20: Disable Trap(3), Intimidate(4), Open Lock(3), Search(3), Set Trap(3), Tumble(3), UMD(3), <br>21: Save(5), <br>22: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Open Lock(2), Search(2), Set Trap(2), Tumble(2), UMD(2), <br>23: Save(5), <br>24: Save(10), <br>25: Save(15), <br>26: Save(20), <br>27: Disable Trap(5), Hide(3), Move Silently(3), Open Lock(5), Search(5), Set Trap(5), Tumble(5), <br>28: Save(5), <br>29: Save(10), <br>30: Save(15), <br>31: Save(20), <br>32: Disable Trap(5), Hide(4), Move Silently(3), Open Lock(5), Search(5), Set Trap(4), Tumble(5), <br>33: Disable Trap(1), Hide(3), Move Silently(4), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Tumble(1), <br>34: Disable Trap(1), Hide(3), Lore(1), Move Silently(3), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Tumble(1), <br>35: Disable Trap(1), Hide(3), Lore(1), Move Silently(3), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Tumble(1), <br>36: Disable Trap(1), Hide(3), Lore(1), Move Silently(3), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Tumble(1), <br>37: Disable Trap(1), Hide(3), Lore(1), Move Silently(3), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Tumble(1), <br>38: Disable Trap(1), Hide(4), Lore(1), Move Silently(4), Open Lock(1), <br>39: Disable Trap(1), Hide(2), Lore(5), Move Silently(2), Open Lock(1), <br>40: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Lore(7), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1),<br>_________________<br>Great Research Tools:<br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWNWiki</a><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">NWN Epic Character Build Search Engine</a><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/" target="_blank">The NWN Vault</a>

Your AB should be 42 (28 BAB, +9 DEX, +1 WM, +1 WF, +1 EP, +2 EWF).<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Monk 20 WM 19 Wiz 1 is a classic dex based dual kama wielder.  WM bonus epic feats make room for dual wield feats, and if you build it human you can fit 4 WM levels in pre-epic for the full attack schedule.  Good build, if you don't mind run and gun true-striking and IKD spam <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
