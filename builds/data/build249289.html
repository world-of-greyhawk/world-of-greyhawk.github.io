Even after the thunderous cascade of rock and flame, he stood there still.  Unmoving.  Unflinching.  A stoic silhouette lit only by the apocolyptic spray of fire and lightning that erupted from the siege engines and war wizards of the enemy.  A hailstorm of arrows and bolts clattered harmlessly off his blackened platemail, and every now and then one could see his hand move to snap a feathered shaft from where it pierced his armor.  In one instance, he disappeared completely in a great ball of flame and smoke, and the defenders on the wall inhaled sharply.  But when the ash and debris settled, he stood there still, kneeling in the rubble to light a cigar from a nearby burning corpse.  <br><br>And as he slowly stood up a grim smile played across his cracked and blistered lips, and he laughed and said, "Is that all you got, lads?"<br>______________<br><br><b> The Battling Citadel of Moradin</b><br><br>Rogue10/Fighter4/Dwarven Defender26<br><br>Playable: 1-40, PvM<br>Race: Dwarf<br>Alignment: Any Lawful<br><br><b>Attributes</b><br>Str15 (26)<br>Int14<br>Wis8<br>Dex14<br>Con18 (22)<br>Chr6<br><br><b>Level Guide</b><br>1 Rogue1, Luck of Heroes<br>2 Rogue2<br>3 Fighter1, Toughness, Knockdown<br>4 Fighter2, Weapon Focus: Warhammer, Str16<br>5 Rogue3<br>6 Rogue4, Dodge<br>7 Rogue5<br>8 Rogue6, Str17<br>9 Fighter3, Improved Knockdown<br>10 DwD1<br>11 DwD2<br>12 DwD3, Blindfighting, Str18<br>13 DwD4<br>14 DwD5<br>15 DwD6, Improved Crit: WarHammer<br>16 DwD7, Con19<br>17 Rogue7<br>18 DwD8, Iron Will<br>19 DwD9<br>20 DwD10, Con20<br>21 DwD11, EWF: WarHammer<br>22 Rogue8<br>23 DwD12<br>24 Fighter4, WS/EWS: WarHammer, Con21<br>25 DwD13<br>26 DwD14, EDR I<br>27 Rogue9, Great Str I<br>28 DwD15, Str20<br>29 DwD16<br>30 DwD17, Great Str II<br>31 DwD18, EDR II<br>32 DwD19, Str22<br>33 DwD20, Great Str III<br>34 DwD21<br>35 DwD22, EDR III<br>36 DwD23, Great Str IV, Str25<br>37 Rogue10, Crippling Strike<br>38 DwD24<br>39 DwD25, Great Con I<br>40 DwD26, Epic Prowess, Str26<br><br><b>Combat Vitals</b><br>AB: 40/35/30/25 (x3/19-20)<br>AC: 30 (Plate &amp; Shield)<br>HP: 692<br>DR: 27/-<br><br><b>Saves</b><br>Fort: 29 (35)<br>Will: 22 (28)<br>Reflex: 22 (28)<br><br><b>Skills</b><br>Discipline: 43 (51)<br>Tumble: 40<br>UMD: 37 (35)<br>Listen: 43 (42)<br>Craft Armor: 15 (17)<br>Craft Weapon: 10 (12)<br>Spellcraft: 18 (20)<br>Heal: 6 (5)<br>Lore:6 (10)<br>Search: 10 (11)<br>Open Locks: 6 (8)<br><br><b>Advanatges</b><br>High Hit Points<br>Nearly maximum allowable Damage Reduction<br>Evasion<br>Epic Weapon Specialization<br>Rogue skill set throughout the build<br>5d6 Sneak/Improved Knockdown<br>Crippling Strike<br>Defensive Awareness<br>Defensive Stance<br><br>_______________<br><br>There is nothing new here.  Just a tried and true strategy.  An attempt to get the best of 3 classes at once without having to be hopelessly mired in mediocrity.  What makes this build attractive is its capacity for a balanced approach to both offense and defense.   He achieves Damage Reduction fast, maintains competitive saving throws, and has a variety of ways to damage his opponent.  Has enough skill points for customization of skills, and one can take a traps-based approach rather than the Crafting one I established here.  AB and AC are good enough for low to mid-magic environments.  Whether in party or solo play, he should provide a solid and versatile melee template for all players.<br><br>There are a few Fighter/Rogue/DwDs in the Guild, and for good reason-- it's a damn good combination.  Probably the one most similar would be <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "229114", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Masterful Barricade</a>, a Rogue14/Ftr4/DwD22. If one is keen on getting Crippling Strike, I would probably fashion a bit more like that one, but CS was never a goal or a priority in this build, but rather icing on the cake.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/12/07 16:13</span></i></p>

A nifty build Grizz, and somewhat reminiscent of one I've been working on (Not sure if I'll bother posting mine now...) Rather an unexpectedly short tale from you though.

Oh yeah, more dwarves!<br><br>Improved Evasion would be nice (because your Reflex ain't high), but you'd need to sacrifice your Great CON (your HP is already high, and with that DR it won't be a great loss) to move Epic Prowess as you lose an epic feat and 3 DR, not a good idea if you're going PvP against those IGMS spammers, but it could be a nice addition for magical resistance, as your physical resistance is already awesome, mostly working in PvM though.<br><br>Solid rocking power grizz, a good one, I like it very much.

Nice Build GD and an effective intro (But a cigar? Real dwarves smoke pipes! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  ).  Not much to add, pretty solid all the way through. Maybe swap crippling strike for improved evasion, but that's about it.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
