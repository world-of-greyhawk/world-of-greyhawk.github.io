Slashing and Singing, Raging and Braising, and Terrifying Enemies PvM (1-40) and PvP <br><br><br>DRAGON BLADE<br>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar<br><br>Concept: <br>Dragon Blades were an elite fighting force, comprised of combat warriors who actually rode and fought upon dragons; the pair, rider and dragon, were dedicated to the preservation and defense of a far away land, somewhere in the desert. It is said the bond between dragon and his/her rider is a strong and magical one. It is also said that, in time, the bond grows between a rider and his/her dragon, such that they begin to “see” and “think” as one, and that each of the pair eventually take on many characteristics of the other. It is widely believed all Dragon Blades (and their dragons) died out during the time of the dragon wars. <br><br>They are wrong: a few survived. <br><br>Character:<br>Dragon Blade combines the song and a touch of magic from bard, the terrifying rage of epic barbarian, and the strength and draconic abilities of the RDD. The result is a fire-breathing meelee’er, sporting fashionable red wings, having high natural AB and the potential for some serious damage, with access to magic (bard buffs and UMD), and a lingering song. In turn, it produces a Terrifying Rager with good AC –and- “savable” saves; saves could definitely be better, and this Drake can readily make it so, thanks to having full access to UMD and Bard buffs. As such, and with very high HPs (i.e., over 600 raging, with listen, discipline, and taunt all topped out), the Dragon Blade definitely holds his/her own in combat, and isn’t concerned about sneakers. The Dragon Blade is thus a solid and well-rounded melee’er, with a Terrifying Rage DC 56-65+, and is highly playable. <br><br>Other Builds: <br>This build is an older one of mine, but a fun one, which I dusted off for the purpose of sharing with the guild (seeing also as I have't posted in awhile). While not the first of his/her kind (there being, according to pulse cap, 11 others utilizing the same class combo), none are the same as this one in terms of the level split (and thus differing foci), with the exception that is of one: a cool build by CD, entitled: Raging Skald, which (like 99%), run RDD up pre-epic. This one does not. There is one that, similar to this drake, delays RDD to epic; that (also cool) build (by jjellison, entitled: Musclehead) is a half-orc dev. critter, having only 2 bard (again, different focus). Dragon Blade is thus unique, and s/he proudly joins the other (all cool) “dragon war survivors”, which makes for a healthy dozen in total (links to all the differing manifestations of this splendid and wonderful species (Brb/Ba/RDD), below).

Glad to see my little professor-girl back to posting, is all I say. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>About the build, you effectively cheat yourself of any bonus feats and even have to spend a feat on heavy armor which is a pity.

Well, hello there back and thank you so much Thax and Grim (indeed, it is good to be back; I missed you guys, and everyone here, too!! So very kind of you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>And thank you also for the praise re: dragon blade; yeah, he's quite the H/S monster alright (a barbarian w. terrifying rage, enough levels to make it count, and with his own clarity? yee-ouch!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">     <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">     <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">    <br><br>Grim, less levels, eh? I thought you liked your barbarians big and strong ... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">      <br><br>But yeah, you and Thax are right: not my usual fare, apart from well that blade series of mine; here, wanted to do just that, rash power of the barbarian, with bard (and rdd) to compensate for the otherwise (oh so typical) 'weaknesses' of ie ragers (those will saves of theirs, otherwise, abysmal). Thanks to bard and of course UMD/skills <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     True, more bard would def. be fun (you guys know I won't argue that, me love dem bards); would lose some 'raw' power (i.e., about -3 AB), but of course pick up more spells and better song; if we did that, though, begins to feel an awful lot like me Dragon Slayer build . . . (yeah, me still likes that one much, too). Also, the idea here being: with 20+ levels brbn, there's enough to make that terrifying rage count. And if we went with a bit more bbn (ie., for that bonus feat, I hears ya, I do, I do) then we'd lose out on some buffs (unless of course haste is readily available ie on a player's world, in which case don't need the bard's spell, so one more feat ie epic may in fact be worth it). Good thinking, as always! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>(oh so good to be back, indeed!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br><br>Akulious: and a big hello to you too; as to UMD, it stands for use magic device (sorry, keep thinking that everyone "just knows" this stuff, and so happy (always) to see a new member (hey, that's why we're here, and I well remember having to learn all this stuff, too - so hail, and well met! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>OK, UMD it's (in my opinion) arguably the most important of the skills, allows you not only to use wands and other magical devices (including all those great bard toys, like lich lyrics, and instruments i.e. mandolins), but also all those great scrolls (meta magic), thereby able to not only self-buff all your stats, but also opening up all means of exciting damage options, and also self-protection (not to mention reciprocal damage shields, way too much fun, and practical, too)<br><br>Here's a link for you: <a href="http://www.nwnwiki.org/Use_magic_device" target="_blank">http://www.nwnwiki.org/Use_magic_device</a> <br><br>Not sure what you mean, re: the link to wiki; just checked to make sure that the spells are there, and all seems okay (Internet, always problems though, hears ya); but it seems to be fine now. (and thanks for the question!)<br><br>And in the wise words of Grim, .... May your blade always be sharp and . . .

Well, at least your posting style hasn't changed much.<br><br>UMD also lets you use restricted equipment, such as Monk or Wizard armor without having levels in such classes, I find that quite nice too, sometimes good weapons or armor are class restricted, depends on the PW, being able to pick any is nice.
