A few tweaks to my weapon master/rogue/fighter<br><br>strength weapon master/sneaker who gets dev crit asap.<br><br>Stats at level 1; Human:<br>18 STR (raise NOTHING but STR until told not to.)<br>13 DEX (you'll raise this to 14 eventually. You won't touch other stats.)<br>12 CON<br>13 INT<br>8 WIS<br>8 CHA<br><br>SKILLS: Spot (rogue/wm), Hide (rogue), Move Silently (rogue), Discipline (fighter/wm), Intimidate (4 ranks only), Tumble (rogue), Use Magic Device (up to whatever you want it; depending on the equipment you want to use), Set Trap (do not raise higher than 6 unless you want to sacrifice umd early on. You will eventually be able to raise again (when you take more rogue levels))<br><br>You will not always be able to put full ranks into every skill every level because of how the level up order goes. Note that when Rogue X*; that means it's time to up your tumble to the next height (in increments of 5; the * represents take the rogue level THAT level.)<br><br><br>In the end you will be: Rogue 17 / Fighter 16 / Weapon Master 7<br>Your BASE skills should look (similair) to this: Discipline: 40; Hide: 43; Move Silently: 43; Set Trap: 38; Spot: 43; Use Magic Device: 41; Tumble: 40; Intimidate: 4; the build will achieve Epic Skill Focus in Hide, Move Silently, and Discipline. (so add 10 to those stats if you want to know their "effective" base)<br><br>And now, without further adoe, the build (greatsword can be substituted for Great Axe or Spear or Halberd):<br><br>(1) Rogue 1 - Dodge, Expertise<br>(2) Rogue 1 / Fighter 1 - Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>(3) Rogue 1 / Fighter 2 - Mobility, Knockdown<br>(5) Rogue 1 / Fighter 4 - Weapon Spec: Greatsword<br>(6) Rogue 1 / Fighter 5 - Spring Attack<br>(7) Rogue 2* / Fighter 5<br>(8) Rogue 2 / Fighter 6 - Whirlwind Attack<br>---<br>(9) Rogue 2 / Fighter 6 / Weapon Master 1 - Improved Critical: Greatsword, Weapon of Choice: Greatsword<br>(12) Rogue 3* / Fighter 6 / Weapon Master 3 - Blind-Fight<br>(15) Rogue 3 / Fighter 6 / Weapon Master 6 - Power Attack<br>(18) Rogue 4* / Fighter 7 / Weapon Master 7 - Cleave<br>(19) Rogue 4 / Fighter 8 / Weapon Master 7 - Great Cleave<br>(20) Rogue 4 / Fighter 9 / Weapon Master 7<br>----<br>(21) Rogue 4 / Fighter 10 / Weapon Master 7 - Great Strength I, Overwhelming Critical: Greatsword<br>(23) Rogue 5* / Fighter 11 / Weapon Master 7<br>(24) Rogue 5 / Fighter 12 / Weapon Master 7 - DEVASTATING CRITICAL: Great Sword, Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>(26) Rogue 5 / Fighter 14 / Weapon Master 7 - Epic Weapon Specialization: Greatsword<br>(27) Rogue 6 / Fighter 14 / Weapon Master 7 - Armor Skin<br>(28) Rogue 7* / Fighter 14 / Weapon Master 7 - *increase dex; 14 now)* FROM NOW ON; ALL STR.<br>---<br>(30) Rogue 9 / Fighter 14 / Weapon Master 7 - Improved Knockdown<br>(31) Rogue 10 / Fighter 14 / Weapon Master 7 - Improved Evasion (about time)<br>(32) Rogue 10 / Fighter 15 (discipline) / Weapon Master 7<br>(33) Rogue 11* / Fighter 15 / Weapon Master 7 - Fire Resistance I<br>(35) Rogue 13 / Fighter 15 / Weapon Master 7 - Crippling Strike<br>(36) Rogue 14 / Fighter 15 / Weapon Master 7 - Acid Resistance I<br>(37) Rogue 14 / Fighter 16 (discipline) / Weapon Master 7 - Epic Prowess<br>(39) Rogue 16 / Fighter 16 / Weapon Master 7 - Improved Sneak Attack I, Skill Mastery<br>(40) Rogue 17 / Fighter 16 / Weapon Master 7 - Sneak Attack +10d6<br><br><br>~ LOck.<br>_________________<br>"Life builds you up just to burn you down." - 3rd Strike, Hang On.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 01:49</span></i></p>
