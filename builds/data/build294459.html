While he is no powerhouse, he seems to do well in PvM and is easily soloed, but shines in party play.  His hit points won’t allow him to go toe-to-toe with heavy hitters, but he can pump his AC rather quickly with all the Dodge cap will allow while supplementing it with Improved Invis.  His high Charisma gives him a nice built-in ESF: Taunt for lowering enemy ACs as well as assign some teeth to his spell DCs and giving him a nice store of extra castings.  He is further bolstered by very high-saves, and should be safe against all but the highest DCs (short of autofail).  He won’t bust down any doors with his AB, but given his ability to self-buff, a 45 base will be more than enough in low to mid magic settings for him to riddle his enemy with divine vollies of missile fire.<br><br><br><i>Fixed leveling guide - Kail Pendragon</i><br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 03/30/08 13:52</span></i></p>

Interesting, thanks to the bump from Arcane Archer you managed to use all your stat increases on CHA and still have a good AB, thus raising divine damage, AC and saves.

Wow! I had just threatened to post a very similar build. I have to say that if I had to be trumped by anyone, I'd rather it be you. Well done.

Maybe I am missing something, but I tried to build this at the Novice to Epic Character Builder and it wouldn't let me select Arcane Archer so soon, due to the character not having a BAB of 6+. Built it with Paladin tho, and it has been proving to be a fun one.

Very nice build.  Damage output looks pretty solid.  I think War Cry adds +2 slashing damage on top of what you listed, too.  With only minor tweaking, this could make a really solid Lasting Song AA for PvP, too.  A little more emphasis on Dex over Cha, and a 20 4 16 level split would it, I think.<br><br>Either way, very solid work.
