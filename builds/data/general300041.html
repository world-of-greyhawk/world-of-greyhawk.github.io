Does the Eldritch Knight have access to Epic Spells on epic levels? I'm test building a Wiz 5/EK 25/ Bladesinger 10, i leveled as far as 24 (EK 13), and no epic spells have become selectable. I've maxed my spellcraft also?????

The epic spells in the PRC work differently than the stock game. I'm not familiar with the mechanics, but I think you need to access them through the radial menu (I believe you have to research them through a wizard lab or something like that). Check the documentation.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

PRC works like this for EPic spells.  First you must find the seed for the spell.  These look like books.  There is a chart on prc forum that shows these (me thinks, i use prc2.2 rules).  Once you read/use the book then you need to have the XP requirement (above lvl) and the amount of gold that the spell requires.  You then need to port to a "laboratory" to learn the spell.  IF you are playing with PRC rules, you should see a yellow wording after a rest that says you have a certain amount of epic spells to use.  The nice thing is you dont use them like a wizard!  <br><br>You also MUST have the Spellcraft to learn the spell (and you roll vs spellcraft DC to learn (you can miss learning it!)).   Lore allows you to learn epic spells in multiples of 10.  so 20 means 2 epics etc.   The highest spellcraft is something like 108 or something.  <br><br>Hope that helps.  WHat server are you playing on?

As far as i can tell, yes, you are screwed with HOTU.  Seeds are droppables or purchaseables.  PRC may have an option for adding them, but i only play online, so i have no idea.<br><br>Epic casting feat?  I am not sure what you are refering too?  If you mean 'How do i cast epic spells?", that is easy.  They are in the radial spell menu once you learn them and have the lore to mem them.  I just took them from there and put in a hotkey.  Casting then is just pressing the hot key.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 11/27/07 23:01 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I agree with avado, Storm of Vengeance rocks, it stuns great, it can deal heavy damage over time, and Evasion doesn't work against it, you should try it in your strategy as well, too bad it's conjura<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 08/14/08 02:14</span></i></p></div></blockquote>

The Epic Spellcasting System that Bneshank created (and was opted into the PRC, btw) is the closest there is to the real D&amp;D PnP counterpart.  <br><br>As has been said before, one has to first "research and learn" the spell seeds, before one can research and learn an Epic Spell.<br><br>Spell Seeds are Tomes, of course.  One can get them in the Epic Lab (which one can access from the radial or the Convo, I am not sure.  I think it is a Convo).  In any regards, one can purchase the Spell Seeds there, as well as the Epic Spells themselves (which are also Tomes).<br><br>A Tome is a book, btw.<br><br>Normally, the Book itself is placed on a Spellbook Alter in the Epic Spellcasting Lab - and then the appropriate checks are made - if passed, and one has the necessary XP and Gold (depends on the Epic Spell itself), then one has learned it.  It gets added to the Characters list of Epic Spells.<br><br>One can then select up to I believe 6 Epic Spells in the Casting List (this is a limit due to the Epic Spell Radial having a bug in it).  Since they can be changed out, it is not that bad (though one has to use the Convo to do it).<br><br>Castings are based on Lore/10 - which is a heck of a lot better than the standard NWN system of once/day!<br><br>Also, I believe there are 64 Epic Spells to choose from - which also include the standard Epic Spells that Bioware included, as well.<br><br><br>So to be honest, the system is a lot better than the standard one, by a long shot!  Not only is one not required to sacrifice precious feats (because one does not have to spend any feats to get Epic Spells), it allows multiple castings of Epic Spells per day.<br><br>I especially love Audience of Stone <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Here is the Epic Spellcasting System in it's entirety :<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;:: Epic Spellcasting ::<br><br>Epic characters with spellcasting capabilities are often capable of casting epic spells. You must have over 20 caster levels, including prestige classes. So a 21 wizard or a 16wizard/5archmage can cast epic spells, but a 20 cleric cant' In order to use the Epic Spellcasting system, one must open up the radial menu (right-click), go to the spells icon, select the epic spells icon (to the right), and then click "Replenish Spell Slots".<br><br>A dialog will appear. It has several options, mostly self-explanitory. Here you can "memorize" epic spells. This will put spells that you know onto the radial, or remove them. Due to a bioware bug, you can only have 6 epic spells ready to cast at any time. You can change spells on the radial at any point, you do not have to rest, and the radial changes instantly. Another feature is the ability to transport to an epic spell laboratory (module builders: this can be disabled... see below.) Here is where you can actually learn Epic Spells. (You can learn epic spells at any "laboratory" (which may be an altar for clerics, stone circle for duids, or anything a builder can think of), but these are not placed in modules unless done so by the builder.)<br><br>:: Epic Spell Laboratory ::<br><br>If you applied the hak using the PRC installer, by default you will have access to the epic spell laboratory. Here you can purchase every spell seed and every epic spellbook from a merchant. Also for sale is a large array of the new non-epic wizard spell scrolls available in the PRC, so that you can try out those.<br><br>Module builders have the option of turning these features off. This is useful for persistent worlds where power shouldn't be so easy to come by. Access to the lab is controlled by a module variable called PRC_SPELLSLAB. The following options are available:<br><br>   0. (default) Can teleport to the Epic Spell Laboratory, merchant sells all epic spells and new wizard scrolls.<br>   1. Can teleport to the Epic Spell Laboratory, merchant sells only the epic spells available in HotU and new wizard scrolls.<br>   2. Can teleport to the Epic Spell Laboratory, but the merchant is unavailable.<br>   3. Cannot teleport to the Epic Spell Laboratory.<br><br>Hardcore PW's would most likely choose option 3. Option 2, however, is good for less difficult PW's which want to make it possible to research epic spells easily but still want to control the spells that are available and make them harder to get.<br><br>:: Learning Epic Spells ::<br><br>Every epic spell requires several things to learn:<br><br>   1. High enough Spellcraft skill to successfully learn it. The DC varies. Range from 25 to 100, approx. Spell focus feats reduce this DC.<br>   2. Excess experience. The XP cost varies. You can not lose a level, so any XP must be above the minimum for that level. The XP is equal to GP divided by 25, so between 9,000 and 36,000.<br>   3. Gold. The price varies. The gold cost is equal to the DC multiplied by 9,000, so between 225,000 and 900,000 GP.<br>   4. Proper seed(s). Some spells also require other epic spells to have been researched first.<br><br>To determine the requirements of an epic spell, you can use the spellbook.i.e. Use the uniqe power ability of the spell book you wish to learn. This will also show you what that spells effect are, and what is required to cast as some spells burn XP and/or cause backlash damage.<br><br>The seeds are available as spellbooks from the merchant, if he is available. These basically teach your character 'secrets' which are needed to learn to spell. For example, an "Seed of Armor" is required to cast "Epic Mage Armor." To acquire the knowledge of a spell seed, simply use the book. This does not cost anything. It has a chance to disintegrate, which is good for controlling the availability of seeds in persistent worlds.<br><br>Once you have all the required things, learning a spell can be attempted. You simply place the book of the epic spell in the inventory of the "Tome of Epic Spell Learning" in the Epic Spell Laboratory. You will be automatically successful if you have the components and your Spellcraft skill + 10 is equal to or higher than the required Spellcraft. Otherwise, you will do a skill check to see if learning it succeeds. If you suceed the check, the GP and XP is removed. If you fail, no XP is lost, but you do loose half the GP cost. If you cannot do the research becuase you dont know the right seeds or cant pay the cost, you suffer no penalty.<br><br>All of this information is also summed up if you check the description of the Tome of Epic Spell Learning.<br><br>:: Casting Epic Spells ::<br><br>Once you've learned an epic spell, it needs to be added to your radial menu. To do this, go back to the "Replenish Spell Slots" icon on your radial menu. One of the options should be to manage your epic spells. Here you can add/remove spells from your radial menu. There is also a handy, "Identify all items" option.<br><br>Once you have the spell added to your radial menu, I recommend you add it to the hotbar at the bottom of the screen. This ensures it is easy to access.<br><br>You have a limit per day of how many epic spells you can cast. You can gain these back if you rest. It is determined by your Lore skill. It is equal to lore/10 and includes skill focus feats.<br><br>Some epic spells can cost XP/Gold each time you cast them. In order to cast a spell you must again pass a spellcraft check. The "Spellcraft + 10 &gt;= Required Skill" rule still applies, but if your spellcraft isn't that good you might fail and lose your slot and whatever XP/Gold components are required by that spell.<br><br>:: Other Information ::<br><br>This replaces the bioware spells, so they are no longer avaliable as feats. Characters that already have the bioware epic spells may experience bugs.<br><br>Boneshank put a lot of toggle switches into the scripts, check "inc_epicspells" for details. Here, you can also change costs, DC for any spells, prerequsiites for any spells and attatch research cutscenes.<br><br>Epic Spell 	Default DC 	XP Casting Cost 	Backlash<br>Audience of Stone 	41 		<br>Achilles Heel 	54 		<br>Allied Martyr 	47 		<br>All Hope Lost 	29 		<br>Anarchy's Call 	43 		<br>Animus Blast 	30 		<br>Animus Blizzard 	58 		<br>Army Unfallen 	66 		d6/per ally<br>Battle Bounding 	41 		<br>Celestial Council 	27 		<br>Champion's Valor 	45 	200 	<br>Contingent Resurrection 	52 		<br>Contingent Reunion 	44 		<br>Deadeye Sense 	47 	400 	<br>Dire Winter 	99 	2000 	<br>Dreamscape 	29 		<br>Dragon Knight 	48 		<br>Deathmark 	59 		<br>Dullblades 	54 		10d6<br>Dweomer Thief 	65 		<br>Enslave 	60 	3500 	<br>Epic Mage Armor 	46 		<br>Epic Repulsion 	34 		<br>Epic Spell Reflection 	108 	10000 	<br>Epic Warding 	68 		<br>Eternal Freedom 	92 	10000 	<br>Fiendish Words 	27 		<br>Fleetness of Foot 	32 		<br>Gem Cage 	48 		<br>Godsmite 	63 		d4/per level<br>Greater Ruin 	59 		<br>Greater Spell Resistance 	67 		<br>Greater Timestop 	27 		<br>Hellball 	70 	400 	10d6<br>Hell Send 	34 		<br>Herculean Alliance 	61 		<br>Herculean Empowerment 	51 		<br>Impenetrability 	54 		10d6<br>Leech Field 	64 		<br>Legendary Artisan 	78 		<br>Life Force Transfer 	0 		<br>Magma Burst 	80 		<br>Mass Penguin 	35 		<br>Momento Mori 	78 		<br>Mummy Dust 	35 		<br>Nailed to the Sky 	42 	1000 	<br>Night's Undoing 	24 		<br>Order Restored 	43 		<br>Paths Become Known 	36 		<br>Peerless Penitence 	68 	1000 	<br>Pestilence 	44 	600 	<br>Pious Parley 	36 		<br>Planar Cell 	51 		<br>Psionic Salvo 	74 		<br>Rain of Fire 	75 	500 	<br>Risen Reunited 	67 		<br>Ruin 	29 		<br>Singular Sunder 	58 		<br>Spell Worm 	25 		<br>Storm Mantle 	74 		<br>Summon Aberration 	42 		<br>Superb Dispelling 	59 		10d6<br>Symrustar's Spellbinding 	0 		<br>The Withering 	69 	300 	<br>Tolodine's Killing Wind 	91 	400 	<br>Transcendent Vitality 	101 	10000 	<br>Twinfiend 	64 		<br>Unholy Disciple 	47 	300 	<br>Unimpinged 	54 		10d6<br>Unseen Wanderer 	88 	10000 	<br>Whip of Shar 	73</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>_________________<br>A Tangled Web - Upcoming PW with PRC+CEP<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By WebShaman on 11/01/08 20:42</span></i></p>
