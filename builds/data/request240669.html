I was surprised, but when i looked up for Ranger / Monk / Rogue combinations, there are only 4 and none of them has Bane of Enemies, I couldn't believe my eyes, I think it's a fairly strong combination.<br><br>I was thinking on making a Ranger 21 / Monk 2 / Rogue 17, which will allow me to use two kamas with Bane of Enemies on 5 Favored Enemies and 9d6 sneak attack, but I have two main issues about it and would like to hear opinions from fellow builders.<br><br>The first issue is, if I take Ranger all pre-epic I'll retain a 30 BAB, but, I'd need to get Exotic Proficiency to get other kama feats.<br>On the other side, I could take Monk at maybe level 2, with levels 1 and 2 (as second monk level is for Deflect Arrows, since Ranger and Rogue won't get more benefit thatn that) I'd loose only 1 AB and could get skilldump on Tumble, wouldn't need to take Exotic Proficiency and overall would be far more playable.<br><br>The other issue is if I should go DEX or STR based, Rogue gets Uncanny, so I could go DEX for a higher AC, since I won't be wearing heavy armor. I can choose as Favored Enemies undead, constructs and dragons, which are inmune to sneak attacks and thus giving it a decent damage in every or almost every situation (also Favored Enemy dwarves for Dwarven Defenders in PvP).<br>On the other side a STR based would kill really fast with the 9 unhasted APR + sneaks and maybe Favored Enemy, but AC will be suicidally low.<br><br>Availability of Hide/Move Silently might also be a factor, as I commonly prefer to use IKD for sneaks rather than Hide, DEX based gets better Hide checks, but if I don't take Hide, as STR based, I will have less trouble allocating skillpoints. Considering an INT of 14 for IKD, but I won't take more INT.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 05/14/06 22:58</span></i></p>

why go kama at all? how about unarmed (if you can get some good monk gloves)?

Exotic Weapon Proficiency isn't much to take, and is worth one AB (epic prowess is isn't it?).  On the other hand Monk saves you a feat, If you take the two monk levels pre-epic you can boost tumble periodically to increase your AC which would make the character more playable.  Since you probably will have enough epic feats*, I think you could afford to take the exotic weapon proficiency. <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>The other issue is if I should go DEX or STR based, Rogue gets Uncanny, so I could go DEX for a higher AC, since I won't be wearing heavy armor.

If the build is for PvM, just go with the STR-path. With decent dex-gear your AC will be okay. For PvM, the DEX path is possibly best. Dex will be hard to level, at least early on.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Unarmed? it would be so weak, besides, you don't use the automati improved two weapon fighting which is great and one of the ideas.<br><br>Taking 6 Monk levels depends on wether I can get IKD with normal feats or not, bcuase I want sneak strong, but if my feats are not enough then I'm screwed. Let's see, 7 pre-epic, DEX based, 1.Weapon Finesse, 2.Weapon Focus, 3.Improved Critical, 4.Blind-Fight... I think I can take KD and IKD and still take Toughness all pre-epic.<br><br>Might take some time to make the build though.... don't ask why, but I've had to get NWN uninstalled.<br><br>Thanks
