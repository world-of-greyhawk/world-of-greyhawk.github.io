<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM</b><br><br>This is the most recent version of my series of Disciples of Torm. I'm currently playing this one on the Three Towns PW, and it's proving itself very effective indeed, especially at early levels, where the previous versions have been a bit weak. I also tested it in a 1 -&gt; 40 Halls of Epic Training type mod that I made myself, and at level 40 this one outstrips the performance of any of the other versions. <br><br>The major changes here are dropping the scythe for rapier, and changing the levelling to get an extra 4 levels in CoT, and hence another epic bonus feat. This one isn't as good in the smiting department as v1 or v2, but as v3 didn't work as originally stated, I'm used to losing a bit of smiting power. It's still a potent attack against evil, but with nowhere near the power a Damage Adept style build can muster.<br><br>The other versions took Strength domain, mainly in order to get Divine Power as a 3rd level spell. However Divine Power would no longer get an extra attack per round for this build, so I chose Trickery domain instead, for Improved Invisibility. Also, the Trickery domain power, along with one rank in each of Open Lock and Disable Trap, gives the build some rudimentary rogue-like skills, which enhances its ability to go solo.<br><br>I also changed the starting stats to have more Strength at the start, where it's needed the most.<br>Str 16<br>Dex 8<br>Con 10<br>Wis 14<br>Int 12<br>Cha 15<br><br>When reading the levelling guide, it's important to note that the first class listed at each level is the class you take at that level-up.<br><br>Levelling Guide ( a * next to feat denotes CoT bonus feat)<br>1 - Paladin 1 - Toughness, Weapon Focus Rapier<br>2 - Cleric 1 / Paladin 1 - Healing and Trickery domains<br>3 - Cleric 2 / Paladin 1 - Extend Spell<br>4 - Cleric 3 / Paladin 1 - Cha +1 (16)<br>6 - Cleric 5 / Paladin 1 - Zen Archery<br>8 - Paladin 2 / Cleric 6 - Cha +1 (17)<br>9 - Cleric 7 / Paladin 2 - Extra Turning<br>11 - CoT 2 / Cleric 7 / Paladin 2 - Improved Critical Rapier*<br>12 - CoT 3 / Cleric 7 / Paladin 2 - Cha +1 (18), Extra Smiting<br>13 - CoT 4 / Cleric 7 / Paladin 2 - Power Attack*<br>15 - Cleric 8 / CoT 5 / Paladin 2 - Divine Might<br>16 - CoT 6 / Cleric 8 / Paladin 2 - Wis +1 (15), Cleave*<br>18 - Cleric 9 / CoT 7 / Paladin 2 - Divine Shield<br>19 - CoT 8 / Cleric 9 / Paladin 2 - Blind Fight*<br>20 - Cleric 10 / CoT 8 / Paladin 2 - Cha +1 (19)<br>21 - CoT 9 / Cleric 10 / Paladin 2 - Great Charisma 1 (20)<br>22 - CoT 10 / Cleric 10 / Paladin 2 - Epic Weapon Focus Rapier*<br>24 - CoT 12 / Cleric 10 / Paladin 2 - Cha +1, Great Charisma 2 (22)<br>26 - CoT 14 / Cleric 10 / Paladin 2 - Great Wisdom 1*<br>27 - Cleric 11 / CoT 14 / Paladin 2 - Great Charisma 3 (23)<br>28 - CoT 15 / Cleric 11 / Paladin 2 - Cha +1 (24)<br>30 - CoT 17 / Cleric 11 / Paladin 2 - Great Charisma 4 (24)<br>31 - CoT 18 / Cleric 11 / Paladin 2 - Armour Skin*<br>32 - CoT 19 / Cleric 11 / Paladin 2 - Cha +1 (25)<br>33 - CoT 20 / Cleric 11 / Paladin 2 - Great Charisma 5 (26)<br>35 - CoT 22 / Cleric 11 / Paladin 2 - Great Smite 1*<br>36 - CoT 23 / Cleric 11 / Paladin 2 - Cha +1 (27), Great Charisma 6 (28)<br>39 - CoT 26 / Cleric 11 / Paladin 2 - Great Charisma 7 (29), Great Smite 2*<br>40 - Cleric 12 / CoT 26 / Paladin 2 - Cha +1 (30)<br><br>Skills<br>43 Concentration<br>1 Disable Trap<br>42 Discipline<br>1 Open Lock<br>43 Spellcraft<br>20 Tumble<br><br>It's much easier to level this version than any of the previous ones, because it has access to the Cleric spells much earlier. Healing domain helps out an awful lot when it comes to survivability at low levels, as does Greater Magic Weapon, Darkfire and Magic Vestment. As early as 4th level, the build can use Cure Serious Wounds, and all its healing spells are empowered. This also helps when making friends in party play. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    Speaking of which, the build's handiness in a party is enhanced by Zen Archery, allowing decent ranged attacks, that help when playing healer to barbarians and other less holy tanks. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br>It gets access to Heal and Improved Invisibility on level 19 and Harm on level 23, which are also great spells which ease the progress through any PW. Even the ones that nerf Harm still let it do SOME kind of damage.<br><br>I'm not going to do a full BAB calculation because I'm not even sure of which buffs stack and which don't, but trust me the build when fully buffed has no problems hitting monsters at all. Three Towns is by no means a high magic PW, and has some real nasty cretures, and I can usually melee with Power Attack turned on without a problem.<br><br>The damage output from this build has the potential to be absolutely massive, and best of all, it comes in lots of different forms, ie. magical, divine and fire as well as piercing. That makes it very hard to resist indeed. Smiting helps against evil creatures too, as it provides +10 to attack and +84 to damage, and can be used three times a day. If that isn't enough for where you play, you can take Great Smite feats instead of Great Charisma ones on levels 33, 36 and 39, but I prefer the extra duration and power of Divine Might and Divine Shield. The bonus to saves from high Cha is also nice.<br><br>The AC of this build is much better than previous versions, as it can use a shield and has Armour Skin. Magic Vestment can also be cast on shields as well as armour, so even non-magical equipment can be turned into +4 gear. When cast with Extend Spell, the spell lasts 24 hours, so there's no need to worry about it running out. Divine Shield also lasts an entire turn even when cast unbuffed, and provides +10 AC, that handily stacks with any other AC bonuses you may have.<br><br>One of the best things about the buiild is its effectiveness against casters. I don't mean PvP, where all you get is mages spamming IGMS at you, but PvM against mages it does very well. Massive saving throws (+23 to all saves) combined with damage that gets through Stoneskins AND Protection from Elements are the key here. Immunity to disease and fear are invaluable (unless fail on a 1 is disabled) against mummies and dragons. But on most servers, the ultimate monster casters are liches and demiliches, and this build is their worst nightmare. Smite Evil, Heal, and best of all, Lay on Hands make short work of any undead, and these guys are no exception.<br><br>So if you're looking for a divine tank that can pack a punch against creatures with immunities, heal the whole party and buff them before battle, this Disciple can do it all.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 07/07/05 23:44</span></i></p>
