Hey all, I'm really sorry for not following the forum guidelines (Posting the actual classes in the build that you're looking for..) but I can't remember a single one of the classes in this build.<br><br>Can anyone point me to, or know personally the build typically known as "Drow Thrall"? From what I recall it was a sneaking, greatsword weilding elf, that was very efficient at taking down mages.<br><br>Any help at all would be grand, sorry again.<br><br>(Similar builds are more than welcome, in fact, a melee build that excells at taking out Mages without sneaking would probably be ideal, as True Sight is unnerfed on the server I play on.)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Premax on 06/21/05 06:33</span></i></p>

It isn't exactly what you are looking for but this is fairly close:<br><br>Mage Bane by Mythadrates (Wrestling elf, he also could use a shortsword due to his decent dex):<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "128666", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Mage Bane V.2 by Mythadrates (-Lawful good- Archer elf, he also could use a shortsword due to his decent dex -even a holy avenger, but your AB will stink-):<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "196360", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Corvette - MageHunter by WildMustang (Lawful Evil wrestling elf)<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "125164", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>The one that seemed most effective to me was Mage Bane V.2 due to the fact you do ranged attacks (no mestil's acid sheath, death armor... for you), and your damage is mostly divine (forget about epic warding, elemental shields...).

All nice builds, but not quite what I was looking for. Thank you for your attempt, though!<br><br>Anyone that's played on Bastions of War might recall this build being used, if that's any help. =/
