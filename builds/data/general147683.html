I often read on many posts here that people suggest on certain builds that they take certain classes at certain lvls to maximize their bab. It seems that pre-epic is where you have to carefully chooose what class to lvl. How do I ensure that my builds are getting their max bab.

There are 3 types of classes when it comes to BAB<br><br>1. Combat classes (inc paladin, ranger, cot, fighter, blackguard,barbarian)<br>2. Semicombat classes (inc cleric, rogue, shadowdancer, druid, assassin, monk,bard)<br>3. Noncombat classes (sorcerer, wizard,palemaster)<br><br>not all classes listed but you get the idea.<br><br>group 1 classes gain bab at a rate of 1 per level<br>group 2 classes gain bab at a rate of 3 every 4 level<br>group 3 classes gain bab at a rage of 1 per 2 level<br><br>You get a number of attacks based on your BAB.(this exludes monk attacks with unarmed kama)<br>at BAB 0 you get 1 attack per round, BAB 6 you get 2 attacks per round, BAB 11 you get 3 attacks per round , bab 16 you get 4 attacks per round. 20 BAB is the maximum you get at level 20 so 5 attacks per round isnt possible.<br><br>Now if you are in group 2 you lose 1 BAB every 4 levels starting at level 1. So at level 1,5,9,13,17 you lose 1BAB compared to group 1. So it is better to stop one of these classes at a level divisible by 4. ie 4/8/12/16/20. <br><br>If you take 2 classes in this group (e.g. rogue/assasin) at level 5. On your 10th level you will have a BAB of 6. Which is exactly the same as a 4 rogue,4assassin(ignore prereq here) <br><br>If you wanted a class in group 2 to get 4 attacks per round you need to find someway of getting another BAB in. ie 16(group2),4(group1) will give a bab of 16 (4 attacks). If you took group 2 classes in anything but a multiple of 4 you will lose bab. <br><br>this is the same as group 3, you can take 16 levels of group 3 and 4 levels of group 2 and you get 3 attacks per round instead of 2.<br><br>Sorry if that is clear as mud.<br><br>Syrath

I had to read it a few times and run the numbers in my head but I think I got it. So if was making a 14 bard/10rdd/16 pm would lvling it such as 12 bard - 10 rdd - 1 bard - 16 pm - 1 bard, give me the max bab I could get?

At level 20 you'd be 12 Bard (+9 BAB) and 8 RDD (+6) BAB for a total of +15 BAB (3 attacks per round), which is the max possible for that combination of classes.<br>_________________<br>"Well, but you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just<br>'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!"
