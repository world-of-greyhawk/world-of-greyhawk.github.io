I have never built one before so i would like some help on a tank.  The only specific thing i need is that the build does well in PvP.

hmmm problem is you need to decide on deflecting blows or giving damage.

If you can get a +20 ubersmasher; someone else can too.  <br>To use an example of a defence build:<br>The difference, imo, is ALWAYS what can be achieved with mundane items.  If you can get to 60ac with nothing except your underpants on; and another build WITH ITEMS can get to 100 from an underpants ac of 30; you will be in the possible line to get up to 130ac with same or similar items.<br><br>What does make an impact I'd say, is if there a glut of dex items or a glut of heavy items.. and that the player would know already by scanning the buy/trade forum for the pw; or asking one or two players in game.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 05/07/05 10:14</span></i></p>

I would probably consider something like a bard/rdd/wpn mstr.<br>Best thing for focussing would be most likely katana's or bastard sword; get the dualwield capability for when you're up against low-ac high-hp DwD builds.  Kukri's probably about the best for the superhigh crit range (10 or 12 iirc).<br><br><br><br>Second to that, mebbe scythe... hmm.  Here's a thought; mebbe try looking into a druid-shifter (undead) wpnmaster (scythe).  Levels something like d5/s17/wpnmstr18 (19 is better but then you lose epic humanoid for an alternate form focus for emergencies).  At wpn master14 you can add a second weapon; I'd consider something like shortsword for Epic Kobald (+6 weapon for epic shape iirc, and it's nasty to boot)<br>From the scythe perspective you will get FREE a +5; vamp-regen Scythe in Undead Lord shape.  The shape gives some serious immunities and some good damage reduction.  You have a weakness in holy opponents, which is where the suggestion of two weapon master'd weapons come in.<br>This is just kinda thinking out loud though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

One major problem with the shifted shapes is that you're stuck with their shifted stats and only the highest of each shifted item applies. That will probably mean that your char will be very good around levels 24-30 but after that you will simply be stuck where other people continue to improve.

True.  However; the point is offence not defence... the shifted forms are pretty strong when weighted against items you could gather.<br>Big benefit of shifting shapes is that you can hold ANY weapon, and instantly use weapon master abilities on it.<br>I find Scythes are most often restricted down to the slush pile (due to the insane crit levels a wm gets I guess  - x5 to boot <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> ).  The shifter means you can go for the best of the best from enhancement view (weapon profs may be needed); and transfer all those stats to your scythe.<br><br>Agreed on the shifting limitations - that is a sore point of shifting in high magic pw's.  But; like I said.. its an offhand idea, maybe it might just be too far out there to be of use to the general PvP population.

I like the bard/rdd/wm, idea any more thoughts on it? How does 15 bard/ 10 rdd/ 15 wm work?

I would lean more bard6/rdd10/wm24 myself.  That will give you a lot of oomph when it comes to taming the competition.<br>Take bard as your last class to max tumble; umd.  Take bard5 at epic level (if possible; have not worked it out myself), so you can get epic focus umd for wearing uber cross-class kit.

This build takes 25 WM levels.
