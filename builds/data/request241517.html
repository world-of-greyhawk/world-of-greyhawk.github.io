I have posted some of my questions on the "For Everyone Forum" but I figure that this would be a more appropriate place.<br><br>I play on a level 30 server:<br><br>-RDD requires 12 levels of Bard or Sorc<br>-Shadowdancer is dissallowed<br>-Minimum of 3 levels per class taken<br>-No perma-haste or true seeing<br>-No immunities beyone 5/- Element on items<br>-No weapons or armour beyond +3 enchantment<br>-No Paladin spells have been capped or changed<br>-Any build must make logical RP sense<br><br>And with all of that said, I really want a Paladin focussed build. And before anyone jumps out and says "Clerics! Clerics! Clerics!" please take note that I asked for a Paladin! (I have gotten this alot)<br><br>It could be anything really, as long as the Paladin is the focus. <br><br>It could include any combination of Paladin, Monk, Rogue, Harper Scout, Fighter and maybe a LITTLE BIT of Cleric. Though as said, I want this to be a Holy Warrior, dominently: Paladin.<br><br>I particularily like the idea of Harper Scout as an addition because of the RP potential... though I am open to much of anything.<br><br>Requirements:<br><br>-Good AB<br>-Good Smite<br>-Good Saves<br>-Holy Sword<br><br>I do not mind a mediochre AC if that is what it takes to fit the requirements. I was thinking that the HS would help the saves and the smiting because of the Charisma boost. The AB would have to be upwards of 45 (Buffed w/ Weapon) and perhaps even more. I also want to have a feared Smite Evil ability to really inforce the image of a Holy Warrior.<br><br>If anyone has any level 30 builds of this idea laying around, please post. So far I am concidering 15 Paladin/10 CoT/ 5 HS to be the one... though am always open to more suggestions.<br><br>Thanks.

Strength Based:<br><br>Paladin 16 / Bard 14<br>Generic Minstrel Build.<br><br>Human<br>Str 16 (Final = 22)<br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Wis 14<br>Int 12<br>Cha 12 (Final = 13)<br><br>Attribute Increases: 1 in charisma, 6 In strength<br>Feats: <br>Weapon Focus: Scimitar/Longsword<br>Toughness<br>Blind Fight<br>Power Attack<br>Improved Critical: Scimitar/Longsword<br>Cleave<br>Great Cleave<br><br>Epic Feats:<br>Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar/Longsword<br>Epic Prowess (Great Strength I if going for Overwhelming Critical)<br>*Choice*<br><br>Overhwelming Critical is a possibility for the last level feat.<br><br>Level order is paladin 16 / bard 14. Sweet and simple.

Saves are somewhat meak for a paladin.<br><br>Dexterity Based:<br><br>Paladin 16 / Monk 9 / Harper Scout 5<br>This build would be the Blade of the Harpers, the weapon of thier wrath and retribution.

Er... in the first build you said you only get a total of 13 Charisma? Wouldn't that defeat the Smiting ability as well as the Bard Spells? It seems kind of odd.<br><br>And the second build has a -1 to its Charisma modifier. Sorry, but I need something capable of Smiting, somewhat for RP purposes and somewhat for PvP. I think I will try out the second build in a leveler though, just to see how it plays out.<br><br>Does anyone else have any builds? I figured there would be alot of Paladin's out there.

You've only got 30 levels.<br><br>You want good smite, so you want a lot of Paladin and/or CoT (they stack for Smite).<br><br>You want at least 16 Paladin levels for spells, preferably 20.<br><br>You may want a few fighter levels for WS/EWS.<br><br>Given the above, I would consider one of the following:<br><br>Paladin 20/CoT 10 - CoT gives you plenty of bonus feats, Paladin gives you spell casting, you get the full 30 levels of smiting.<br><br>Paladin 20/Fighter 4/CoT 6 - take the 4th fighter level at level 21 or 24 to get WS/EWS, otherwise same as above. You lose 4 levels of smite power, but pick up WS/EWS which helps for every hit.<br><br>Paladin 19-21/Fighter or CoT 4-6/Rogue or Monk or HS 4-5<br>Paladin as above, fighter or CoT for feats and either stacking smite levels or WS/EWS, and Rogue or Monk or HS for skill dumps in Tumble (and UMD for Rogue, or bonus feats from HS).<br><br>Let me know which type you prefer and I will try to flesh it out with some more detail.<br><br>TM

If you want AB, maybe you can try it with a Weapon Master (or even Arcane Archer, but I think you want melee), Paladin 8 / Fighter 6 / Weapon Master 16 lol, nah, I think going Weapon Master makes you loose a lot of Holy Paladin stufsf.<br><br>No haste? that doesn't matters much if you make a Paladin 22 / Fighter 6 / Monk 2, or Paladin 19 / Harper Scout 5 / Monk 6, lots of APR. with a Paladin 22 / Fighter 6 / Monk 2 (or something similar) you can get a good divine might damage addition with that APR.<br><br>Let's see how it gets (notice TM's build is nice, I'm trying different options, not saying it's better anyhow), I'll take ranger instead of Fighter, to be able to go STR based with Improved Two Weapon Fighting easier:<br><br>(Paladin 19 / Ranger 9 / Monk 2) Human<br><br>I'd go DEX based actually, but if you don't care on AC, this guy won't have AC, but high power.<br><br>STR: 15<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 12<br>CHA: 14<br><br>*Pretty bad XP penalty now that I notice, I'll try to avoid it as much as possible delaying Ranger until level 23.<br><br>1 Paladin1 - Power Attack, Knockdown<br>2 Monk1 - [Cleave, Evasion, Kama, Tumble, etc.]<br>3 Ranger1 - Weapon Focus: kama, Favored Enemy I<br>4 Paladin2 - STR +1 (16)<br>5 Paladin3<br>6 Paladin4 - Divine Might<br>7 Paladin5<br>8 Paladin6 - STR +1 (17)<br>9 Paladin7 - Divine Shield<br>10 Paladin8<br>11 Paladin9<br>12 Paladin10 - STR +1 (18), Blind-Fight<br>13 Paladin11<br>14 Paladin12<br>15 Paladin13 - Extra Smiting<br>16 Paladin14 - STR +1 (19)<br>17 Paladin15<br>18 Paladin16 - Toughness<br>19 Paladin17<br>20 Paladin18 - STR +1 (20)<br>21 Paladin19 - Epic Weapon Focus: kama<br>22 Ranger2<br>23 Ranger3<br>24 Ranger4 - STR +1 (21), Epic Prowess<br>25 Ranger5 - Favored Enemy II<br>26 Ranger6<br>27 Ranger7 - Great Charisma I (15)<br>28 Ranger8 - STR +1 (22)<br>29 Ranger9<br>30 Monk2 - Great Charisma II (16) [Tumble skilldump]<br><br>You can always forget the skilldump Tumble in case you don't want AC to take another Favored enemy (Paladin19/Ranger10/Monk1) or Paladin spells (Paladin20/Ranger9/Monk1), or even take Exotic Weapon instead of Toughness to take Monk only on epic levels for +1 BAB, but less playable.<br><br>HP: 408<br>AC: 17 (10 base -1 DEX +1 WIS + 6 Tumble 30 = plain crap AC)<br>BAB: 24<br>AB: 34<br>Flurry AB: +32/+32/+29/+26/+23/+20/+17 Offhand: +32/+27<br>Mainhand damage: 1d6+6 + (3 unbuffed or 9 fully buffed Divine Might)<br>Offhand damage: 1d6+3 + (3 unbuffed or 9 fully buffed Divine Might)

*sighs* Everyone misses the "Minimum 3 levels per class taken" part.<br><br>lol, but that last builds caught my eye. Alot of attacks per round but I can't take any less than 3 levels of Monk.<br><br>Implementing the 3rd Monk level, would it still work well? If so, what would the fully buffed AB be? +5 Holy Sword on both weapons would be really nice I'm sure.<br><br>And what would the potential Smite damage be?

Sorry for the 3 level minimum Okembour...... <br><br>Uh, in my build, you can swap 1 Paladin for Monk no problem, skilldump at level 17 or 22 might be a good idea.<br><br>Smite damage = (Paladin + CoT levels)*(<i>1 +</i>Great Smite #) but neither TM's or my build have the Great Smite feat, I think it's not such a great feat, I gave you extra smiting because it seemed to me that I had extra feats.... oh, you need 25 base CHA to take Great Smite feat, so it's just out of range.<br><br>A smite also gives you bonus AB = CHA modifier. Counting the Paladin buffs, it's a decent amount.<br><br><i>finny -- edited the formula; yours would have made 0 smiting damage if no Great Smiting feats <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> </i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 06/18/06 12:38</span></i></p>

Also add Aura of Glory to that for another +4 and you have a total of 22 (+6) charisma. Thats +6 ab smites, +6 to all saves, and a nifty Lay on Hands. +6 AB is free AB and considering that Its not smite specialized, its helpful to hit higher dex characters with alot of buffs (CLERIC MONK COUGH COUGH) just for a Dispel from Holy Avenger. If you dont want the +16 damage and +6 AB, leave it. Not my choice, yours.<br><br>The second build is stronger than you guys are letting it be. It has a nice dexterity, and with only +5 items, should be able to easily reach 65+ AC, with +3 I can see about 10 or so less, which is still nice considering that everyone is out at least 6 attribute points and 5 BAB, totalling about an 8 point loss of AB.<br><br>The projected AB in a +5 item cap world on the second build is somewhere near 62 or 64 (if extended to level 40), and near 53 or so with the item cap reduced to +3.<br><br>Like I said before, take them or leave them, but they are decent builds in their own stead.<br><br>Charismatic (ish) Paladin build<br><br>Human<br>Paladin 18 / Bard 7 / HS 5<br>Minstrel of &lt;Insert Lawful Good God here&gt;<br><br>Str 16<br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 10<br>Wis 14<br>Cha 14<br><br>Attribute Increases:<br>Charisma 2, Strength 5<br><br>Feats In order:<br>Weapon focus: Longsword/Scimitar<br>Power Attack<br>Divine Might<br>Divine Shield<br>Improved critical: Longsword/Scimitar<br>Extra Smiting -or- Extra Turning<br>Alertness<br>Iron Will<br><br>Epic Feats:<br>Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword/Scimitar<br>Epic Prowess<br>Armor Skin<br>Great Strength I<br><br>Mundane Stats:<br><br>AB: 29 (BAB) + 6 (Str Mod) + 4 (Feats) = 39<br>AC: 10 (Base) + 8 (Full Plate) + 3 (Tower Shield) + 6 (Tumble) + 2 (Armor Skin) = 29<br><br><br><br>Fully Buffed:<br><br>AB: 29 (BAB) + 8 (Str Mod +4 roll on Bull's Strength) + 5 (Greater Magic Weapon) + 4 (Feats) + 5 (Divine Favor) + 1 (Prayer) + 1 (Bless) + 1 (Aid) = 54<br>AC: 10 + 8 + 3 + 6 + 2 + 9 = 38<br><br><br><br>Full +3 Equipment (+3 Shield, Armor, +3 Nymph cloak, +3 Ring of Deflection, +3 Ammulet of NAtural AC, +3 Strength Gloves, +3 Strength Belt) and Full Buffs:<br><br>AB: 29 (BAB) + 11 (Strength Mod +4 Roll on Bull's Strength, +6 From Items) + 5 (Greater Magic Weapon) + 4 (Feats) + 5 (Divine Favor) + 1 (Prayer) + 1 (Bless) + 1 (Aid) = 57<br>AC: 10 + 8 + 3 + 3 (Deflection Mod) + 3 (Armor Mod) + 3 (Natural Mod) + 3 (Shield Mod) + 6 (Tumble) +2 (Armor Skin) + 9 or 10 (Divine Shield, see Below) = 50 AC<br><br><br><br>Buffed Charisma Modifier:<br><br>18 + 4 (Eagle's Splendor, Ideal Roll) + 4 (Aura of Glory) = 26 | +8<br><br><br><br>Charisma Modifier with Items and Buffs:<br><br>18 + 4 (Eagle's Splendor, ideal Roll) + 4 (aura of Glory) + 3 (Nymph Cloak) = 29 | +9<br>You can drink a Potion of Greater Eagle's Splendor for the added charisma.<br><br><br><br>The AC isnt terrible for a strength based character, and the Damage wil be fairly nice. +9 AB smites with full items, +10 if you get a hold of a charisma bonus helm or use a Harper Potion, and +18 damage is not bad in any case. <br><br>Level Order:<br>Paladin 18<br>*Shift Alignment to Neutral Good*<br>Bard 6<br>Harper 5<br>Bard 1<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Freedom-Fighta on 05/24/06 04:16</span></i></p>

He said he didn't wanted AC, so I gave him a low AC crazy APR monk, it doesn't gets a real high AB as I thought it would, but damage can jump without notice.<br><br>Admit it, 13 CHA is just low, especially counting Paladin skills and Divine feats, as much as you can buff it, it's still an odd score and the higher the base goes the higher the buffed goes. The second one with 16 is more like it.<br><br>Don't exceed yourself with the criticals, that's not even a Weapon Master, crits with 9 APR are very common too btw.<br><br>Thanks for mentioning the buffs and stuff, I didn't want to write them all, remember all the buffs count for all this builds (well, maybe except for HS buffs for mine), in fact, with dual-wield buffs boost AB somewhat better.

If you wanted to get more charisma, you could drop cleave and extra smiting from TMs build and shift the fighter levels to epic levels (at the cost of +2 to fortitude saves).  You could then use the fighter feats to take epic weapon focus and epic prowess.  That would free two regular epic feats to take a couple of great charismas to raise your CHA to 18 (you could also shift a couple of strength points to CHA).  With an 18 charisma and +12 from (aura of glory, eagle's splendor X2) you could get a turn of divine might and divine shield.  Remember on top of the base AC (36 with a mundane focused weapon), you can get a +1 from bless, +1 from aid, +1 from prayer, +5 from divine favor, and +5 from greater magic weapon or holy sword (GMW lasts 21 hours, holy sword lasts 21 rounds) so a +13 from buffs to raise that AB to 49.  Plus you could cast Bull's strength to raise that to 51.  That should be as high, or pretty close, to what you could get from a cleric/fighter.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 05/24/06 07:41</span></i></p>

I made a simple Paladin 20/CoT 10... I figured I mine as well start basic. I then tried the Monk that was suggested.<br><br>The Monk hit the bloody enemy so damn fast.... god....<br><br>But the standard Longsword Paladin/CoT had an AB of 50/45/40/35 and had a Smite Damage of 165 all 3 times. His normal damage was also quite good. Would that kind of damage and AB make it worth it? 495 damage on Smites in one day. On a level 30 server that should be pretty decent I would think.<br><br>Comments or anything?<br><br>-----<br><br>And, not that it bothers me too much, but how does a Paladin get good AC? Divine Shield, +2 Full Plate, +2 Tower, +4 from Magic Items...Around 40 I think? Any way to get it any higher?

Yes, get more CHA. Also, Tumble and Armor Skin are basic. Beyond that, no. Unless you want a DEX based Paladin. Or a Paladin/PM. Monk AC bonus helps if you're fighting without a shield/armor, too.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 04/26/06 12:05:52 (GMT) -- Ithacan<br><br>[...]Harper Scout, the only class so powerful it's capped at five. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    <br>[...]</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Woah... er... <br><br>How can you get a Paladin/PM? That would be an alignment shift thing right? And arent Paladin's sworn enemies of undead <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">  I dont think it would make RP sense though I might be wrong.<br><br>On that note, can a Paladin's Turn Undead thing hurt a Pale Master? That would be cool.<br><br>And also, with a buffed AB of 50 and Smite Damage of 165 3 times a day... would that be effective? Pretty low AC I think, but it would hit on his Smites for sure with the Empowered Eagles Speldor and Aura thing adding to his Charisma. I started with 16 Charisma for that, if I started with 18 I could get an extra 1-2 great smites but suffer strength. Would it be worth it?<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>P.S. I'm working on a build right now, I will get around to posting it for editing in a day or so. Until then, any advice is -OF COURSE- welcome.

Bard 8 / PM 16 / BG 6 would work there<br><br>Stats can be your chosing, but go at least 14 charisma and stick to dex, grab some Divine Might and Shield with 13 or 14 base strength, dont forget power atk.<br><br>Syck AC on that.

Well, I got around to writing down a build that I tried. It is pretty straight-forward. It has some flaws but it decent in damage.<br><br>---------<br><br>Human: Paladin 20/CoT 10:<br><br>Strength: 14<br>Dexterity: 8<br>Constitution: 10<br>Intelligence: 8<br>Wisdom: 14<br>Charisma: 18 (26)<br><br>----------<br><br>Paladin 1: Toughness, Power Attack<br>Paladin 2: <br>Paladin 3: Divine Might<br>Paladin 4:<br>Paladin 5:<br>Paladin 6: Divine Shield<br>Paladin 7:<br>Paladin 8:<br>Paladin 9: Extra Smiting<br>Paladin 10:<br>Paladin 11:<br>Paladin 12: Weapon Focus Rapier<br>Paladin 13: <br>Paladin 14:<br>Paladin 15: Empower Spell<br>Paladin 16:<br>Paladin 17:<br>Paladin 18: Improved Critical Rapier<br>Paladin 19:<br><br>CoT 1:<br>CoT 2: Great Charisma, Epic Weapon Focus Rapier<br>CoT 3:<br>CoT 4: Epic Prowess<br>CoT 5: Great Smiting I<br>CoT 6: Great Smiting II<br>CoT 7:<br>CoT 8: Great Smiting III - IV<br>CoT 9:<br><br>Paladin 20:<br><br>CoT: Great Smiting V - VI<br><br>----------<br><br>- Skill points can maximize any two skills. Dicipline and Spot, or Discipline and Taunt were my #1 choices.<br><br>- Epic Prowess might be switched with Epic Skill Focus: Dicipline because being knocked down hurts bad.<br><br>- Rapier was chosen for a great Critical Range rather than longsword. Scimitar might substitute because it is slashing and makes it able to be Keened by wizards.<br><br>- Charisma is raised all the way through. No other attribute could afford to be raised. I didnt bother typing it in because you all know when attribute points come.<br><br>----------<br><br>Unbuffed with Mundane Equipment:<br><br>AB: 31/28/23/18, Critical Range 15-20/x2<br>AC: 20<br><br>Fortitude: 31<br>Reflex: 25<br>Will: 26<br><br>HP: 255 (Oh my god... hideous)<br><br>----------<br><br>Buffed with Various +3 Equipment based on my server:<br><br>AB: 52/47/42/37, +13 on Smite, Critical Range 15-20/x2<br>AC: 46 (Ew...but not much I can do about it)<br><br>Damage: 34 + 4d6 on Evil... +216 on Smite<br><br>Fortitude: 42 (Immune to Death Magic)<br>Reflex: 36 (Sadly, no Evasion)       <br>Will: 37 (Immune to Mind Spells)<br><br>HP: 259 (Oh my god... Hi- De- Ous)<br><br>!!Additionals!! <br><br>-CoT Damage Reduction<br>-Dispell on hit<br>-16 SR (w00t):roll:<br>-Immune to Death and Mind Spells<br>-260 on Most Smites, x2 on a 25% chance Critical!<br><br>----------<br><br>My Thoughts: <br><br>Hit Points are in a disguistingly short supply, so Constitution items are in desperate need, though I doubt they will help too much. With such a low AC I really wish I had more HP... or more AC, though I dont know how to implement either without punishing my Smite by quite a bit.<br><br>I am pleased with the damage, definetly. The only thing I regret is having no Improved Knockdown (One of my Favourite Feats) but I cant fit in the intelligence or the 2 extra feats.<br><br>Defencively this build is just too low! I wouldnt mind crap AC if I could take a beating... but I cant! I have to kill or be killed and I only have 3 shots to do it.<br><br>----------<br><br>Advice? Please dont suggest Armour Skin... 2 AC is not worth an Epic Feat concidering I could get an extra 30 damage instead.<br><br>Thanks.

Well, your Divine Might, Shield and Wrath should be fearsome, I see you decided to go for a Smiter, great for fighting evils, but the rest might get troublesome.<br><br>Now, I see your AB rather low.... when you're not using Divine Wrath, which lasts great for that CHA.<br><br>How come your AC is 20? base 10 -1 DEX is 9... and that's quite it where do you get those 11? that is supposed to be unbuffed.... +8 with Heavy Armor and +3 from Tower Shield makes 20... phew, I was begginning to think one of us was crazy... well, you forgot to say that is with Heay armor and Tower Shield.<br><br>You're wrong, 30 damage is nothing compared to survival, your AC is low and your HP too, you're meat as far as reciving damage, don't underestimate Armor Skin.<br><br>I'd Actually go Discipline and Tumble, you desperately need AC, even if it's just 4.<br><br>Wait a second.... why did you started with 18 CHA? you're wasting a lot of points, you free 6 points by starting with 16 and the loss is minimum compared, change CHA to 16, and increase CON to 14 and INT to 12, +40 skills and +80 HP, that should help a lot, calm down with the damage man, smites are not all-working.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 05/25/06 23:28</span></i></p>

*covers ears* You dont know what you're talking about!! *spins in circles screaming*<br><br>. . .<br><br>lol...well I guess -30 damage would take me to 230 on a Smite...hm...still good. I got carried away in infinite punishment to them darn evil folk.<br><br>Tumble would be cross-class, so low, and plus Full Plate and Shield have skill penalty dont they? Does that apply?<br><br>I guess I could start with 16 Charisma. Would I still be able to get up to Great Smiting V? I want at least that, I can forgoe the VI though.

Alright, I just tried it starting with 16 Charisma.<br><br>I got 350 HP with no items and my AC was 39 without Magical Equipment. On my server I might get +12 to +15 so potentially I could get 54 AC, backed by around 400HP.<br><br>My AB was 51 Buffed, rather than 52 (I think) and my general damage was still pretty good since Divine Might and Divine Shield still had the same ending Charisma of 26 natural. (Charisma is all I added)<br><br>Unfortunatly...I could only get Great Smiting II and the damage was only 160! On a critical it would be quite decent but with only 3 swings a day the chances are awfully low.<br><br>. . .<br><br>Any advice? Or am I stuck choosing between these two?<br><br>I still really wanted IKD dammit!!

If you want IKD you'd need to change Paladin levels for Fighter levels in order to get enough feats, and the 16 CHA path of course, since IKD need 13 INT.<br><br>You can take Great Smiting instead of Armor Skin, it's ultimately your desition.... I don't know for Tumble having penalties... anyway, Tumble gives 1 AC per 5 base score, the check does not matter.... oh, you're based 30, lol, I forgot for a moment, then Tumble only gives you 3 AC.<br><br>The thing with smiting is that they...... are... wasted.. completely.... if the enemy is not evil, if 80%-100% of enemies in your server are evil, go smiting! if not, it could be a waste of feats.

lol thanks (made a second thread for this build:p)<br><br>But I just found a Sorc/Monk/PM that got 68 AC with no magic items and only a few buffs. On my server it could get about 80 as well, except there are only +3 items for the most part. I win <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  ...I think. hehe thanks though.<br><br>-----------<br><br>Still waiting for a bit more Paladin help though.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Okembour on 05/27/06 17:00</span></i></p>

The build will not be good.<br><br>For one there is no epic dodge, meaning all 20's will hit, for two there is no AB, meaning its just you and however many players that fight you at once going at it until you die (and it will be you, not them, that dies).<br><br>And dont let them sucker you into True Strike AB, Truestrike is usually a sign for the enemy to scatter and I assure you that you will not get effective kills on that build.
