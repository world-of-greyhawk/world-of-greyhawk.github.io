Blind Fight negates the AB a concealed mob gets while attacking you (or so I am told) [on top of you getting the extra chance to overcome conceal]<br><br>What is the AB a concealed mob gets?  I am considering taking this feat with my Cleric caster and want to know if it is worth it.<br><br>BTW: Am I  missing something or is there no Search function?

If you plan on doing alot of Melee combat, then Blind Fight is very valuable.  A re-roll to hit a concealed person is a HUGE advantage.

That's actually a good question. The only thing I can come up with is the DEX modifier to AC which gets ignored when attacking out of invisibility... But that would suggest that Blind Fight does (almost) the same as Uncanny Dodge, which can't be true...<br><br>I know Blind Fight is a great feat to have on a melee character, but I don't know exactly how it helps beyond effectively halving the enemy's concealment bonus. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By LuckyNephilim on 12/21/06 19:33</span></i></p>

According to wikki here is part of the Invisibility description:<br><br>==<br>Invisible attacking creatures get a 50% Concealment bonus against enemy attacks and can ignore the dexterity modifier of any opponent unless that opponent has the Uncanny Dodge feat.<br>==<br><br>When and invisible person attacks, the target does not have access to it's Dexterity modifier in order to help it's AC.  Uncanny Dodge (and Blind Fight) would help retain that Dex Bonus.<br><br>So, it's not that an Attacking Invisible person has a BONUS when attacking, it's just that the defender (Blind Fight user) no longer has a penalty applied (lack of Dex).<br><br><br><br>(that is my interpretation)

Blind-Fight is a passive combat feat, it applies whenever you fail to hit an enemy due to concealment. Supposedly, invisible creatures no longer get bonus to hit you, but that means they lose the added bonus, I'm not sure how much it is, but flat footed penalties still apply. If I'm correct you do get a bonus to hit if you're invisible and you attack someone who can't see you, Blind-Fight does not work as Uncanny Dodge or Defensive Awareness, that's for sure.<br><br>Flat footed bonus makes you lose all your DEX and Dodge AC. You will lose your Dodge AC when flat footed even if you have Uncanny Dodge or Defensive Awareness.<br><br>When an enemy is concealed (note: not the same that invisible) you get a chance to automatically miss when you attack him, the percentage changes with different spells. Concealment makes so that you miss no matter your AB or roll, or even crit, with a certain percentage. If you have Blind-Fight you'll reroll automatically when you miss because of Concealment, and try to hit again, which effectively squares your chances to hit a concealed enemy.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/21/06 21:57</span></i></p>
