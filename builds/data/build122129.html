Ultimate Maximum Doom Lord: Revised Edition<br><br>This version trades in a lot of the Blackguard abilities in the old version (Sneak Attack, free summons, save boosts) to increase the spellcasting, damage, and stealth abilities of the character. The favored enemies can be anything you so choose, but for RP purposes I would definitely choose some or all of the player races, particularly the more common ones (Humans, Dwarves, Elves). Furthermore, the UMDL is now immune to smiting because of the neutral alignment. This version should prove significantly more powerful than the old version, as it can set and disable traps, sneak, and cast 8th-level arcane spells. This character should definitely use light armor, for spellcasting, stealth, and dual-wielding purposes.<br><br>Human CN Ranger 20 / Pale Master 11 / Wizard 9<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>STR: 17<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 14<br>INT: 14<br>WIS: 13<br>CHR: 8<br><br>Level Progression:<br>Level 1: Ranger<br>Levels 2-5: Wizard<br>Levels 6-9: Pale Master<br>Levels 10-27: Ranger<br>Levels 28-29: Wizard<br>Level 30: Ranger<br>Levels 31-33: Wizard<br>Levels 34-40: Pale Master<br><br>Attribute Progression:<br>+1 to Strength at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28<br>+1 to Intelligence at 32, 36, 40<br><br>Feat Progression:<br>Level 1: Power Attack, Luck of Heroes, Favored Enemy #1<br>Level 3: Cleave<br>Level 6: Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>Level 9: Great Cleave<br>Level 12: Toughness<br>Level 13: Favored Enemy #2<br>Level 15: Improved Critical: Scimitar<br>Level 17: Improved Two-Weapon Fighting (Ranger bonus feat)<br>Level 18: Knockdown, Favored Enemy #3<br>Level 21: Great Strength I<br>Level 23: Favored Enemy #4<br>Level 24: Overwhelming Critical: Scimitar<br>Level 27: Great Strength II<br>Level 28: Empower Spell (Wizard Bonus Feat)<br>Level 30: Favored Enemy #5, Bane of Enemies<br>Level 33: Devastating Critical: Scimitar<br>Level 36: Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>Level 39: Great Intelligence I<br><br>Final Attributes:<br>STR: 26<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 14<br>INT: 18<br>WIS: 13<br>CHR: 8<br><br>Maximum HP: 455 HP (20d10 + 11d6 + 33 for Deathless Vigor + 9d4 + 80 for Constitution + 40 for Toughness)<br><br>Skills:<br>If I've done my math correctly, this build gets 267 total skill points, accounting for increases in the Intelligence modifier in the later stages of development.
