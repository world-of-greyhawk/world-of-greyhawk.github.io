I am looking for some dedicated RPers that would like to help some friends of mine RP some evil RDD's. I'd like to come up with some ideas we can RP and make a presence on the server. I've been playing on this server for a long time and It lacks some of the better RPers as of late. One DM is in the process of creating another area that will be the Empire of Kaarkosa. As of right now we are looking to develop a drow culture with 8 houses (thus 8 legs of spider) with ranks in each house. Some houses will be NPCs while others can be PCs. I have even more detailed informatin if anyone is interested just PM and I'll send you more and give you some people to contact. Here are some of the descriptions.<br><br><br>Kaarkosa; a Foreign Perspective<br><br><br>Many have heard of the distant land of Kaarkosa, but few can confirm many details. It is well known that they refer to themselves as an Empire, for example, but what nations or holdings constitute this Empire? <br>This missive is an attempt at offering some insight into this distant power, while putting forth as few rumors and suppositions as possible. <br><br>The Land <br><br>The Empire of Kaarkosa exists solely on a land mass approximately one-third the size of Antonica, the continent upon which most other civilized lands exist. It is a land of great geographic diversity, containing a vast desert, titanic mountain ranges, lush forests, and rolling hills. Some specific examples follow: <br><br>The Kharne Desert- A majestic and dangerous land and the last holdout of the ancient Mulhorandi faith. Kharne, as a nation, predates the Empire and was settled in ancient days. The primary port of call is the sprawling city of Ophelia; a place of exotic sights and smells, beautiful spires, and constant trade. <br><br>Morduin Mountains- Some foreigners have taken to referring to this range as the Boyne Mountains, thanks to a rather prolific cartographer by that name in Florence. Most Kaarkosans, however, still use the name given the range by the Dwarves who claim those lands. <br><br>Stormkeep Mountains- Another range of multiple names, these storm-wracked peaks are said to be the original home of the Styrmgard Imperial line. In the ancient tongue of the natives, these are called the Kepeskhurthians, though few remain outside the range who speaks the ‘Auld Tongue’. <br><br>Moors of Intahept- The enigmatic Vaashari, and their Fey’ri nobility make their homes among the heaths and peat bogs, as well as the primeval forests of the Realm of Telkoun. It is also said that the ruins of some truly ancient civilization lies beneath these moors. <br><br>The Underdark- Unlike in most other parts of Haven, the Underdark of Kaarkosa is a relatively well-known region. The varied city-states of the Deep have aligned and joined under the Imperial banner…though likely to greater and lesser degrees depending on the ever-shifting power of each city. Duergar, Drow, and more exotic creatures live beneath the surface of Kaarkosa, and produce some fascinating exports. It is said that the trade city of Belaern is truly a sight to behold. <br><br>The Realms <br><br>Kaarkosa is an Empire divided into five known Realms. Rumors persist of a Sixth Realm. <br><br>Udosst- Said to mean, simply, ‘Ours’ in the tongue of the Drow, Udosst is the Realm which exists beneath the surface of Kaarkosa; the Underdark. Ruled over by a Chancelor, who is elected from among their ruling body, the Blada d' Pahntar Velven. This Chancelor functions as the Prefect for the entire Realm. A term of 10 years is the current accepted time in office. There are no current reports as to the name of this Prefect. <br><br>Kharne- Covered above. Ruled over by Prefect Neferka. <br><br>Telkoun- A somewhat 'wild' Realm, comprised largely of hills, moors, low mountains, a few raging rivers, and the majority of Kaarkosa's forests. It is said that one Prefect Nailo rules over Telkoun. Rumors state variably that he is of Draconic or Elvish descent; perhaps both. It is known that Prefect Nailo has ruled over the forests for some time, and has both enemies and allies within the savage lands. His rule is strengthened by his alliance (some say blood-relationship) to the insular clan of Blue Dragons which make their home in the rocky hills which border on Kharne. <br><br>Morduin- The name of both the Mountains and the nation which exists within them. This is the land of the Morduin Dwarves. Little is known about the reclusive Clans of Morduin, and the occasional tale of great tragedy makes its way even to Antonica. Many say they suffered greatly during the Shattering, but all agree they have not slowed down much at all. Providers of the bulk of Kaarkosa’s arms and armor, the Realm of Morduin is ruled over by a High Thane, who serves as the Prefect for the Realm. His name is currently unknown outside Kaarkosa. <br><br>Qatja- Also called ‘The Core’ by many Kaarkosans, it is said that Emperor Styrmgard named this Realm after his Mother, but this is unsubstantiated. Certainly this is the most developed surface realm in all Kaarkosa; a Realm of cities, well-kept roads, and busy ports. Most travelers to Kaarkosa never see beyond either the gateway city of Ravensport, or the capital; Zahran. <br><br>Kaarkosan Titles <br><br>Though the precise details and hierarchy of these titles has yet to be confirmed, the following can be reported with some confidence: <br><br>Emperor Styrmgard- Also referred to as the Padishah, the Font, and the Voice. The final word in all matters of the Empire. Viewed as a living embodiment of the Empire itself. Said to be partially ‘divine’, though this is likely an allusion to the ‘Divine Right of Kings’ which is a long-held belief in many nations, and held as doctrine by the church of Siamorphe. The matter of succession is a much discussed issue, though few are certain as to the specifics. It’s unlikely an unresolved matter however, as it’s well known that the First Emperor leaves few things unplanned. <br><br>Prefect- The entirety of the Empire is arranged in a total of Five Realms. Each of which is overseen by a Prefect. These individuals are handpicked by the Emperor himself, sometimes from among local government, sometimes otherwise, and their term is at his (dis)pleasure. Each is responsible for communication with the Satraps of the Provinces under their Realm, and must ensure that all Imperial edicts are met with compliance. <br><br>Satrap-A Satrap oversees each of the growing number of Provinces in the Five Realms. A Satrap might oversee a small town with vast farming territories, a barren wasteland composed of something the Empire holds dear, or a metropolis of staggering complexity. Technically, each Satrap is of equal rank. In practice, much of an individual Satrap’s power depends on the true value of his Province, and his ability to play at the politics of the Empire. Satraps are chosen by their Prefects. <br><br>Boyar- Much like mayors or magistrates. The Boyar report to the Satrap in charge of their province. Part accountant, part diplomat, and all manager. Some of the Boyars are chosen from among the wealthy, and it’s not uncommon for a Boyarship to have been bought. This is slowly forming a ‘noble’ class in the Empire, known as the Sirdar. A Boyar’s responsibilities and freedoms are largely dependant upon his Satrap’s needs. <br><br>Ranks Outside the Administrative Hierarchy <br><br>Vizier-Anyone can be named to the position of Vizier by either a Prefect or the Emperor himself. The position is largely honorary, but one must consider the power of the individual who granted the title, when dealing with an individual Vizier. Ideally, a Vizier is an expert in some field; a sage, magus, master craftsman, etc. They are usually granted the title in order to perform some duty on behalf of Realm or Empire, which might give them the ability to travel and perform tasks usually beyond their rank. <br><br>Ambassador-Similar in ranking to the Vizier, and named in a similar way. One must consider their Patron when dealing with an Ambassador. An Ambassador is, as the name implies, a diplomat or representative of an individual Realm (usually traveling w/in the Empire), or the Empire as a whole (could be found anywhere). <br><br>Hierodula- The priests, the temple warriors, the Clerics. These are the men and women who serve their Gods and the Empire. Only a limited number of faiths are accepted within Kaarkosa, and only those who serve these faiths are granted the rights and rank of Hierodula. A Hierodula holds no true power beyond respect and political relationships within the hierarchy, but a Hierodula assigned to a ranking officer might have a good deal of power on her side. <br><br>The Military <br><br>Strategos- A General. Each Strategos varies, depending on the power of her Prefect and Realm. Each Strategos is ultimately responsible for the defense of the Realm to which she is assigned. This mandate of preservation even outweighs a Prefect’s orders to take offensive/hostile action. Finally, there is rumored to be a little-used, but heavily conditioned law called The Closed Fist. Should the Emperor ever invoke The Closed Fist, each and every Strategos has strict orders. These orders are known only to the Strategos. <br><br>Voivode- Essentially, a Field Commander. The responsibilities of a Field Commander vary widely depending on the goals of her command. There are Voivodes serving in purely combative positions, with a force of soldiers heavily engaged in clearing hostile territory, or fighting enemies of the Empire. Some have said that there are Voivodes who command a squad of Spies or Assassins in foreign lands. This is purely conjecture, however. The title remains the same and all are of equal rank in the eyes of the Empire. Each Voivode reports to a Strategos. <br><br>Janissary-The true soldiers of the Empire. The Kaarkosan Janissary is a heavily disciplined warrior, with a strong sense of the fate which awaits him according to his success or failure in the field. Some have ascended to the rank after slavery or imprisonment, but most were raised since childhood in service to the Empire. The Emperor is father, and the Janissary corps is family. There is nothing else. Janissary and Legionnaire are interchangeable terms. It is likely that the Janissary have a ranking system in place within the Legions, but this is still an unknown hierarchy. <br><br>Silsilah-The lowest rank among the Kaarkosan military. Composed of slaves and prisoners, finding worth and a ‘second chance’ in service. They are ‘The Chained Ones’ in common parlance. For these, only exemplary service, or death, is a release from this ranking. Most conquered peoples find themselves supplying forces to the ranks of the Silsilah. Rarely, a notable officer among the conquered may find himself ushered directly to the camps of the Janissary. <br><br><br>Additional Notes <br><br>Of particular interest, and largely to fault for the loose ties between Kaarkosa and the rest of the world, is that the Majeirai Consortium, the well known Mage’s Guild which has linked much of the world with their amazing portal and bindstone system, does not have a guild-house or portal in the Empire. The Consortium has, thus far, been quiet on the precise reasons for this. It is known, however, that the Empire has a state-affiliated ‘guild’ of Mages. Perhaps the two organizations have yet to find common ground.
