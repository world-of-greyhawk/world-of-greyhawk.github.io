This is an RP build based on the character Vladimir Taltos from the books by Steven Brust. I am not completely happy with it - NWN does not lend itself well to the set of skills the character has. I prefer him as a fighter/Wizard/Assassin from a RP perspective, but there is no way to get ED in that build, which really weakens it as a dex-build. It does get higher AB and Death Attack DC, though. I can post that one too if anyone is interested. I really envision the character as a Fighter/Wizard/Assassin/SD (I think of his ability to blend into a crowd as he walks away from an assassination as HiPS), but no can do 4 classes with NWN.....<br><br>Anyway here he is. The Wiz levels are primarily for RP purposes, although the buffs and True Strike will be useful. I won't do a story for him, Steven has already done them far better than I could.<br><br>Rogue(16), Wizard(6), Assassin(18), Human<br>Alignment - must be evil for Assassin (although I picture the character as more of True Neutral).<br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 18 (34)<br>CON: 10<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 12<br><br>Hitpoints: 228<br>Skillpoints: 365<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 16/18/36<br>BAB: 24<br>AB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 37 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 30/30<br>Death Attack DC: 30<br>Sneak attack: 17d6<br>Familiar - I think the Pseudo-Dragon is closest to a Jhereg, although you could go with Faerie-dragon or even Bat.

Cha was for RP reasons - Vlad is somewhat of a charismatic guy, and generates a lot of loyalty from his friends. An 8 cha didn't seem right for him, but you are right that he could put those points into Con. The Cha does help with UMD somewhat, also.<br><br>His familiar isn't for combat - Loiosh in the books is a Jhereg, he is poisonous, but rarely fights at all. He is used primarily as a scout, to spot the guards, traps, etc., before Vlad goes in, and sometimes as a decoy, to distract a guard or victim for a moment before the fatal blow comes. And yes, Vlad almost always kills with a single blow (usually a rapier thrust to the heart, or a dagger in the eye, but I didn't have room for 2 focuses in the build). <br><br>I thought about more Wiz levels, but I wanted a high DA. The Fighter/Wiz/Assassin works pretty well except for the lack of ED.

I must make a point. The guy that can kill this guy in ONE lucky blow doesn't exist. He's got Epic Dodge. Add to that the high AC he will have and you got a hard to kill in melee build. Actually, I went up against Big M in HotU with 200 hp even with the items I wore. Never used as much as a cure light wound even. So sometimes hp isn't everything.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Oh, I misread his original comment to mean that Vlad was designed to get 1-hit kills, not be killed in 1 hit. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>In order to kill him in 1 hit, you have to do 2 things: First, you must see him. Note the maxed Hide and Move Silent, plus Assassins have the spell-like abilities of Improved Invisibility and Darkness.<br><br>Second, as Grimnir noted, you have to hit him. Naked AC is 30, he can self-buff with Cat's Grace, Mage Armor, Shield, etc., with decent equipment you should expect him to have a rather high AC. Epic dodge in the first version will guarantee the first swing misses. Imp Invis or Darkness will give him 50% concealment, so half of all swings will miss (or 25% if you have Blindfight). And if he sneaks up on you and gets in that first Death Attack, you will be paralyzed for a long time, so you won't get to make any attacks.<br><br>His weakness is enemies that are either immune to sneak/death attack, or ones with True Sight. For ones with True Sight, he will use his familiar or a henchman to distract them so he can still get the sneak attack in ("No matter how powerful the wizard, a dagger between the shoulderblades will really cramp his style...."). For ones that are immune to his sneak attack, he will call Morollan or Aliera to help him out.<br><br>TM

It wasn't a powerbuild, I was trying to create a character from a series of books I like. The first one is Jhereg, they are by Steven Brust (as I mentioned in the first post). Very fun, mostly light easy reads. They do get a bit more serious starting with the third book Teckla, but are still quite fun. Steven likes to try some interesting things from a literary style point of view - each of the books is written quite differently. Some are straight up story-telling, some use a lot of jumping around in time (i.e. telling the story out of order), some use multiple points of view, all are good reads with a lot of clever humor. I recommend you check them out.<br><br>TM
