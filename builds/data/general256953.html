I am building a character based on the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "248384", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Moor Stalker v2.0</a>. I just got to lev 6 and took my first assassin level, and have found that my ranged attacks do not do a death attack. My melee attacks do. It seemed like the build assumed doing death attacks with the longbow. Did I misunderstand the build or maybe do something wrong? Thanks for any help in advance!<br><br>Also, I just joined and must say, this guild has been a god send! I like to RP my character, not build them, so it's great to have so many good builds that I can pick one that matches my RP and still will be usable PvM or PvP.

To have a chance at Ranged Death Attacking someone there are a few things that must happen:  must be within 30 feet, must catch the opponent flat footed, opponent must not be in combat mode, Opponent must be susceptible to sneak attack (no undeads, etc).<br><br>that info should help.

Ah, the 30 feet thing was getting me. Thats exactly what I wanted to hear, thanks Bromium!  I was afraid that it was changed in a patch or on the server. <br><br>Now I just need to test how far 30 feet is in game...
