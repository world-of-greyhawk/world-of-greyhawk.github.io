<b>Playable from 1-40...PvM build</b><br><br>I realized that there aren't too many strength based paladins in the guild so I figured I'd post one.  This build will do best in +5 to +10 magic item setting. I went for a CoT/Fighter/Paladin, the build is pretty strong and doesn't really need any buffs, though it has them if necessary.  In a +5 equipment environment this build should do quite well, and be able to manage a +12 to charisma and probably a +8 to +12 to strength including buffs.  Thus, it should be able to get a lot of use out of divine might and shield, possibly even divine wrath.  Because it can use divine shield to boost its AC, I chose a greatsword for a weapon.  With a 30 STR it seemed appropriate, though you could focus in a 1 handed weapon if you want the extra AC.  This build would rend a charisma based paladin limb from limb in a one on one fight.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-High AB.  This build has an AB of 44 with a mundane greatsword.  Throw the paladin buffs and taunt bonus on top of that and his maximum effective AB is 76.<br>-High Taunt.  With a 55 taunt he should have no trouble taunting opponents (I thought, it was the only the other players that found paladins annoying).<br>-High Damage. This build averages 28 points of damage with a mundane greatsword, unbuffed.  Throw in buffs and he does, 56 points of damage on average (59.5 vs. evil, 66.5 vs. undead), 19 points of that is non physical and difficult to resist (sonic, magic and divine).<br>-Devastating Critical with a 40 DC base.<br>-High Fortitude save. With a 37 base (really 32 because sacred defense counts towards the save boost limit) fortitude save he is fairly devastating critical resistant.                <br>-Good Reflex and Will saves vs. spells.  29 isn't all that great, but after casting Eagle's Splendor and Aura of Glory his saves will jump to 32-33 and divine wrath can get them even higher.  He should make his saves against will and reflex targeted spells unless the caster is really focused.<br>-Immune to Fear.<br>-Immune to Disease.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br><br>-Melee is his only form of attack.  He has no trap setting ability or offensive spell casting, if he can't hit something he's in trouble.<br>-No real spell defense.  He'll probably make his saves, but he'll still take damage from spells.  Against spellcasters, he does have over 500 hitpoints and a weapon that dispels on hit with a 26 DC, so he might have a slim chance.<br>-Lowish AC. For a character that uses a two-handed weapon it's pretty good, but his hitpoints are bit low for a character that uses a two-hander (though he can heal some of it) and he doesn't have any damage reduction.  You might want to consider using a one-handed weapon and a shield instead of a greatsword.<br><br><b>Herculean Knight</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Human<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Lawful Good<br><br><i>Base Attribute</i><br>STR 14   <br>DEX 8<br>CON 14  <br>WIS 14 <br>INT 14 <br>CHA 14<br><br><i>Leveling Guide</i><br>Levels 1-2 Fighter<br>Levels 3-6 Paladin<br>Levels 7-8 Fighter<br>Level 9 Paladin<br>Levels 10-11 Champion of Torm<br>Level 12 Paladin<br>Levels 13-14 Champion of Torm<br>Level 15 Paladin<br>Levels 16-17 Champion of Torm<br>Levels 18-20 Paladin<br>Level 21 Fighter<br>Level 22 Paladin<br>Level 23 Fighter<br>Level 24 Paladin<br>Level 25 Fighter<br>Level 26 Paladin<br>Level 27 Fighter<br>Level 28 Paladin<br>Level 29 Champion of Torm<br>Level 30 Paladin<br>Level 31 Champion of Torm<br>Level 32 Paladin<br>Level 33 Fighter<br>Level 34 Paladin<br>Level 35 Fighter<br>Level 36 Paladin<br>Level 37 Champion of Torm<br>Level 38 Paladin<br>Level 39 Champion of Torm<br>Level 40 Paladin <br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Champion of Torm 10<br>Fighter 10<br>Paladin 20<br><br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>All 10 go to Strength<br><br><i>Feats</i><br>Level 1: Weapon Focus (Greatsword), Power Attack, Toughness<br>Level 2: Knockdown<br>Level 3: Cleave<br>Level 6: Divine Might<br>Level 8: Weapon Specialization (Greatsword)<br>Level 9: Divine Shield<br>Level 11: Improved Knockdown <br>Level 12: Great Fortitude<br>Level 14: Improved Critical (Greatsword)<br>Level 15: Extend Spell<br>Level 17: Great Cleave<br>Level 18: Blind-Fight<br>Level 21: Great Strength I<br>Level 23: Epic Weapon Focus (Greatsword)<br>Level 24: Great Strength II<br>Level 27: Great Strength III, Epic Weapon Specialization (Greatsword)<br>Level 30: Great Strength IV<br>Level 31: Overwhelming Critical (Greatsword)<br>Level 33: Great Strength V<br>Level 35: Devastating Critical (Greatsword)  <br>Level 36: Great Strength VI <br>Level 39: Epic Skill Focus (Taunt), Epic Prowess<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 30<br>DEX 8<br>CON 14<br>WIS 14<br>INT 14<br>CHA 14<br><br><i>Final Saves</i> Base/Sacred Defense/Vs.

For a two-hander, I don't think 520 is a bit low.  I think it's just right.  You really can't make it much more than that without having to change everything.  With just 1 +4item or potion of Endurance, he can hit 600.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I am confused about the saving throw limit from Paladin's saving throw bonus and the saving throw bonus from CoT levels.  Is there a limit?
