ok, this one gets lotsa XP penalty, but the idea is interesting enough.  well, not the part with a dual kama wielding monk, but the rest is.  also, no one has tried this combo before and posted to tell about it, so here we go.<br><br>the idea was to create a char that could sneak up on wizards, giving them a good thumping.  they should be mostly resistant to the wizards poor melee and strong spell casting.  also, if the char is a pm, i think that using bless weapon and holy sword will add up on the damage.  also, using holy sword dispels on the caster, which helps when the mage has some DR spell or some such nonsense.  i didn't want the char dependant upon buffing, yet with the ability to do so.<br><br>i made two versions of this build.  both seem decent, each with their own perks and downsides.  i like this one best, but i will post both for comparison. <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "219952", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Witchhunter V2</a><br><br><b>playable, 1-40, PVM</b><br>Human<br>lawful good alignment<br><br>STR 10<br>DEX 16 to 26<br>CON 14<br>WIS 14 to 18<br>INT 12<br>CHA 10<br><br><br>Skills: 265<br>Discipline 43<br>Tumble 40<br>Hide 43<br>Move Silently 43<br>Set Trap 20<br>Disable Trap 1<br>UMD 35<br>Spellcraft 20 (40cc)<br><br><br>Spells:<br>1: Deafening Clang/Bless Weapon x 2, Endure Elements<br>2: Aura of Glory, Eagle's Splendour<br>3: Prayer x 2<br>4: Holy Sword x 2<br><br><br>AC: 35<br>HP: 456<br><br><br>Attack: 40/37/34/31/28, 38/35/32/29/26 &amp; 38/35 dual wield<br>Damage: 1d6 (20/x2) + 4d6 Sneak Attack<br><br><br>Saving Throws: [spellcraft bonus] <br>        Fort: 26[30]<br>        Will: 24[28] Still Mind<br>        Refl: 29[33] Improved Evasion<br>     <br>           <br>Pros:<br>slight Sneak Attack, +4d6<br>Skills allow to set traps and remove unused ones, stealth, defense and using magic goodies<br>Ok saves, boosted through charisma (spells), min +3, max +4 on spells<br>pally spells mostly on weapons<br>immune to fear, poison, disease<br>natural 28 SR<br>empty body, 50% concealment for 18 rounds, twice a day<br>weak turn undead<br>improved evasion<br>+2 versus mind spells from still mind<br>+1 versus death magic from strong soul<br>monk speed 150%<br>can heal 36 HP as monk<br>can heal 45 min, 60 max as paladin<br>stunning fist and quivering palm, improved unarmed strike when disarmed (if ever)<br>weak smite evil<br>remove disease<br>uncanny dodge II, +1 to reflex saves on traps<br>umd strong enough to cast spells offensively without failure, good for buffing<br>flurry of blows gives another attack, -2 on AB<br><br><br>1 R1 Blind Fight, Strong Soul<br>2 P1      <br>3 M1 Weap Fin<br>4 P2                          <br>5 P3      <br>6 P4 Ambi<br>7 M2      <br>8 P5                         <br>9 P6 TWF<br>10 P7<br>11 P8<br>12 M3 Weap Foc           <br>13 P9<br>14 P10<br>15 P11 ITWF<br>16 P12                       <br>17 M4<br>18 P13 Toughness<br>19 P14<br>20 P15                     <br><br>21 M5 EWF<br>22 R2<br>23 M6<br>24 M7 GW I        <br>25 M8<br>26 M9<br>27 M10 GW II<br>28 M11                <br>29 M12<br>30 M13 GW III<br>31 M14<br>32 R3                <br>33 M15 GW IV<br>34 R4<br>35 M16<br>36 M17 EP       <br>37 R5<br>38 R6<br>39 R7 AS<br>40 M18                 <br><br>check out the other version and compare them.  let me know what you think.  i am pretty happy with the way both this one and the other turned out.  comments and suggestions welcome.<br><br>-c<br><br><b>*****     *****     *****     *****</b><br><i>griphook ..Added Link</i><br>_________________<br>"Many that live deserve death.

my thanks to griphook for adding the link between this build and the other.<br><br>i don't really like the idea of a steaming plate of entrails thing though...perhaps a nice mug o' mead?<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>Do not meddle in the affairs of Dragons, for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.
