I had the weird thought... would a Wizard multiclass better with a Ranger or a Druid, and would either one be able to stand up to PvM? I checked out the Sneaky Wizard of the Woods build, but I don't want that much SD influence (perhaps a level or two for defense). Basically, I want a Wizard who's at home in wilderness areas, not just in his tower, and who can, in an emergency, melee a monster without being torn apart like tissue paper.<br><br>Any ideas?<br>_________________<br>Walk Softly and Carry an Enchanted Weapon.

If you plan on taking some wizard levels pre-epic and still want to be able to have a decent melee ability (BAB at least 15 i assume) then you would want to multi-class with the ranger.  you can keep wisdom low, since you will be getting great wizard spells anyways, and you will get the bonus of an animal companion.  you will also get access to some great class skills, which you can use to put those extra wizard skill points into.  it depends on what you have in mind, but search is helpful, as is hide and move silently.  also you get access to martial weapons, which if you are a half-elf can help you qualify for an arcane archer.  even if you are a non-elven class, you can still take advantage of the wide variety of weapons available to you.<br>just my 2 cents.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Many that live deserve death.
