<b>Playable in PvE 1-40</b><br><br>A more cleric-heavy cleric/blackguard build than what I found on the search engine, designed to take advantage of the Divine Power attack schedule and have enough spell penetration to make memorizing a few Harms worthwhile.<br><br>Human, Any Evil<br>Str 14<br>Dex 10 (8)<br>Con 14<br>Wis 15<br>Int 14<br>Cha 10 (12)<br><br>1 Clr (1): Power Attack, Extend Spell<br>2 Clr (2):<br>3 Clr (3): Spell Penetration%<br>4 Clr (4): +1 wis<br>5 Clr (5):<br>6 Clr (6): Cleave<br>7 Clr (7):<br>8 Clr (8): +1 wis<br>9 BG (1): Weapon Focus (Scimitar)&amp;<br>10 Clr (9):<br>11 Clr (10):<br>12 Clr (11): +1 wis, Greater Spell Penetration%<br>13 Clr (12):<br>14 Clr (13):<br>15 Clr (14): Blind-Fight<br>16 Clr (15): +1 wis<br>17 BG (2):<br>18 Clr (16): Combat Casting<br>19 Clr (17):<br>20 Clr (18): +1 str<br>21 BG (3): Epic Weapon Focus (Scimitar)&amp;<br>22 BG (4):<br>23 BG (5):<br>24 BG (6): +1 str, Great Str 1<br>25 BG (7):<br>26 BG (8):<br>27 BG (9): Great Str 2<br>28 BG (10): +1 str<br>29 Clr (19):<br>30 Clr (20): Great Str 3<br>31 Clr (21):<br>32 BG (11): +1 str<br>33 Clr (22): Great Str 4<br>34 Clr (23): Improved Combat Casting<br>35 Clr (24):<br>36 Clr (25): +1 str, Great Str 5<br>37 BG (12):<br>38 Clr (26): Armor Skin#<br>39 Rog (1): Great Str 6<br>40 BG (13): +1 str, Epic Prowess<br><br>% - Penetration feats can be replaced with KD/IKD if you wish.

So instead of having an attack schedule like +30/+25/+20/+15 you'd have an attack schedule of +30/+25/+20/+30.<br><br>In the case of this build, fully buffed out and hasted, your attack schedule would look something like +63/+58/+53/+63/+63.<br><br><b>Q:  Why did you take spell penetration feats instead of IKD?  This is a sneak attacker, even if his SA dice are comparatively small, and it's not like your save DCs are worth anything for offensive casting.</b><br>A:  Because you get darkness and ultravision as cleric spells, I decided to bump your spell penetration power up to 30.  You still have a 10% chance of failing to punch stock SR, and while your save DCs stink, word of faith and harm don't allow saves.<br><br>If you are in an environment where IKD would be more useful, or if you don't want to mess with offensive casting at all (a reasonable choice) change those feats to suit your needs - I picked them because I'd rather have the ability to Harm something, just in case I run into something that is extremely hard to hit.<br><br>Alternately you can swap armor skin for epic penetration if you really like Harm.  You might want to change Extend to Silent spell then too (turn your level 7 spell slots into even more harms/day).<br><br><b>Q:  Why a rogue level?  Why not bard or monk?</b><br>A:  Because it lets you easily put a point into all the skills that your Trickery domain power buffs by +13 in this build.<br><br><b>Q:  Why not take some more charisma and get divine might/shield?</b><br>A:  There's just not enough room in terms of feats and stat points for that to work out.  Charisma buffing will improve your character anyway - up to +6 to you saves and additional duration on your domain powers.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Xylophone on 11/27/05 23:00</span></i></p>

No the starting stats in parentheses are things you can change - take 2 points from dex and put them in cha.  That's not clear from the description though... my bad.  I always list final stats at the end of the build in the Vitals section.<br><br>As for the rogue level - it's not just for putting a point each into certain skills... it's for maxed tumble and UMD, and increasing your sneak attack damage from 4d6 to 5d6 (rogue and BG sneak attacks stack).  Improved SA would work without rogue levels - blackguard SA counts on its own, it's only assassin death attack SA that doesn't.<br><br>Of course it'd take a whole honkin' lot of BG levels to qualify for improved SA without any rogue in the mix.<br><br>In this case taking Bard or Monk for the cheese skill dump wouldn't be quite as beneficial as taking Rogue since BG already gets concentration, discipline, and taunt, and cleric gets spellcraft if you want that.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Xylophone on 11/28/05 06:01</span></i></p>

I have noticed that this build is rather Cleric heavy ... i cant keep from saying why not grab evasion? Granted the reflex save is kinda weak ... but every dog has its day (sometimes). <br><br>Cleric 24/ BG 13/ Rog 3<br>No 2nd Epic Cleric feat<br>Evasion<br>+1d6 Sneak Attack<br>more skill points<br><br>and a better skill disp through out the build instead of waiting for lvl 39.<br>_________________<br>Demons are Forever!
