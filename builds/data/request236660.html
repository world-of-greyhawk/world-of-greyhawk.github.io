Oh, I hadn't noticed now you're a mod now Kail, congratulations.<br><br>Well, I wouldn't want to see a dragon vs dragon, since dragons generally have high ACs around 90 with low ABs around 50 and high HPs around 900, so, long fight, even longer assuming probable de-shift and heal or regen.<br><br>With +8 items and +6 stats, I think an AA would have an AB around 70 or so... maybe more, a Paladin 10/ Bard 1/ AA 29 is powerful, use bard song, scrolls of cat's grace, aid, bless, and divine favor to buff AB and you should get to hit them.<br><br>High caster will kill dragons easily with empowered or maximized IGMS, true, a dragon's potential SR isn't so high, so you can beat it, this might be your best choice: some Palemaster levels to boost AC, since IGMS maxes out at caster level 20, and automatic still Spell III with full plate and tower shield, with +8 items you can get your AC to good terms and beat them easily.

With 6 attacks per round (even if they have 3 monk levels for Deflect Arrow, you will have a chance at 5), you can drop their speed quite a bit. If you spot them at a distance and get in 3-4 called shots before they close with you, you will be able to play keep away effectively. If they get to you before you have time to do that, it will be over quickly (especially if the Dragon has the Disarm feat...).<br><br>TM

STR based bards can work quite well too, as well as spell sword type builds with spells such as negative energy burst. Good str melee bards are 20/10/10 bard/pm or cot/rdd, and 26/4/10 bard/blackguard, fighter, or cot/RDD, the bard/rdd/pm can get very good defense too, as can the other examples depending on stats, items and whether you take div shield or not.<br><br>And remember; shifters MUST unshift back to their natural form before been able to restore their reduced stats and abilites, hence the reason bards, and negative energy burst mages are such great dragon killers.

Hmmm, STR reducing would work ok, but suppose a max buffed dragon can get STR to 60 with empowered Bull's STR, Extended AoV and Blood Frenzy, so as much as you lower it, you won't make him deal 0. The problem is, although it's a very good idea, that won't decrease his AC, which was what hads78 was saying.....<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Any ideas how i can get the AB high enough to hit these high AC (80/90 odd) dragons reliably...?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Did he ignored this topic? he hasn't said anything.
