Hi all,<br><br>I play in a server that I have to take at least 5 lvs of whatever class my char is. <br>I wanna play a high DC wizard (or could be even sorcerer), but i dont know if i should go pure 40 lvs of wiz, or i should add a second class, such as rogue. So it would be some thing like wizard 35/rogue 5<br><br>what do u guys think? should i go pure wiz or 35/5? is it woth it to take the 5 lvs of rogue in this case?

I guess if you have to take 5 levels, I'd rather take the 5 levels than none.<br>_________________<br><i>Ghaash agh akûl - Nazgûl skoiz<br>Mirdautas vras!<br>Karn ghaamp agh nût<br>Shaut Manwe quiinubat gukh</i><br><br>Summoning - Mirdautas Vras

5 is a bugger, I' like 2 or 3, but yeah, in comparison, your last 5 Wizard levels give very little boost where a second class could gain more.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Unless, of course, your server has any bonuses for remaining pure as a caster.<br>_________________<br>People who say that I am arrogant are mistaken. Arrogance is a flaw; I am flawless.

Unless there are special boni for pure builds, go Wizard 35/Rogue 5. The extra skills and the capacity to UMD clerical buffs are worth the lost caster lvls. DC won't be affected at all, Spell Penetration will be 5 points lower, but it shouldn't be an issue.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

tks for the answers so far.<br><br>Well, i read all the information again, and what it says exactly is this: <br><br>"Requeriments:<br>5 level minimum for any class added to after level 20 that doesn't have at least 5 levels. Classes that are added to before level 20 with 5 or fewer levels are acceptable. <br><br>Examples:<br><br>    * You start off by taking 3 levels of Wizard to qualify for Pale Master. You're allowed to go all the way to level 40 without taking any more classes in Wizard if you wish. However, if you add any more levels of Wizard post level 20, you must take an additional level to round out your Wizard levels to a total of 5. <br><br>    * You start off by taking 2 levels of Bard and the rest Fighter, all the way to level 40: no restrictions on that, 2 Bard/38 Fighter. However, if you take 20 levels of Fighter and then take 2 levels of Bard, you'll be required to take 3 extra levels of Bard before you reach level 40 and your build will end up being 35 Fighter/5 Bard. "<br><br><br>so, if i wanna add a rogue lv at my char lv 38, i would have to have at least a minimum of 5 lvs in rogue. What I could do is take 1 lv of rogue before lv 20 (monk has a 5 lvs req. in general)

The thing is, most of the usefulness of the skilldumping comes from doing it at high levels. I'd take a Rogue level probably at 1, 7, 17, 27 and 37 or something like that.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

If the world is like that, I too would take a rogue.<br>Once the familiar dies, you can use the char to pop their own chests and traps.<br><br>Dependant on how many points you saved for a dump.<br>Im working on something and at level 32, ive still got all my skillpoints.<br><br>If i say 28 human barbarian/2 bard and 10 RDD.....you can guess its gonna be a pretty good tank.<br>_________________<br>Surviving 3 cats, 2 kids and a wife deserves some serious game time, dont cha think ?
