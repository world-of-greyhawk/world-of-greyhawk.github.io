Theonly WM/BG mix with heavy WM has Monk as the third class. While this gal is not the greatest, she does have some advantages. However, she'll run into a bit of a rough patch as far as AB and damage goes from late pre-epic through early epic levels, as she doesn't have the big AB boost from WM and doesn't have a very high CHA. Much of this can be mitigated if she finds STR and/or CHA enhancing gear. Lack of UMD is always lamentable, but she does have some pretty good saves for a straight-up melee character with no CoT levels. Good AB due to WM bonus, but her damage without Divine Might and crits is low. She should seek out both STR and CHA-enhancing gear.<br><br>This isn't by any means an uber build, but she does have some appeal, she's different, and with the Dwarflord posting some very nice builds fairly regularly of late, I've been inspired to have a look through some old ones.

For 4 more AB and another 40 hps, I started with a 15 Str and 14 Con, and then went for a final score of Str24 and Chr22.  Ended with a 47AB that way, which was a little easier to swallow while still having a decent divine damage back-up.

You have a built-in skill focus for it (but I can still see one or 2 bad guys out there where maybe that ESF is needed).  Well done, Cin.  And see, you said the flames were all extinguished.

Fairly nice AB for a 30 CHA build, though it's pretty low for a Weapon Master's standards. It looks like a very good divine damage dealer, most builds with that much divine damage have even lousier ABs. <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; by grizzled_dwarflord<br>I think what bothers you is what bothered me in the end, and that was all those epic bonus feats wasted on Epic Toughnesses. <b>But that's about all there is unfortunately.</b></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Does not!

Kail nailed it.  But back to the ESF: Taunt, the more I think about it the more I like the idea over Discipline.  Since there are no Taunt dumps along the way in Epic, that would be a nice one to drop in there around Level 27-30.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

If you do drop ESF:disc, might as well drop disc entirely.  In many environments, that might not be a bad idea at all.  I know I've played a few meleers w/out discipline (in both senses of the word), and so long as the only attack you have to worry about is KD, and you can get KD immunity...  Of course, if you have called shots and disarms to face as well, I think the ESF is a necessity.

Mister Thax goes crazy from time to time, (or drunk, or who knows, there should be some excuse I can call to whenever I say stupid stuff), have a laugh or two at his incoherent rambling and excuse his misbehavior please.

Don't be so tough on yourself, Thax.  I think you were on to something.  If the WM foregoed some of the Charisma and instead went Str, say Str26/Chr20 split, then you could drop those Epic Toughni (hey, better than Toughnesseses!) for the OC and the DC.  AB is helped in the process as are overall critical and base damage.  <br><br> I think I like the 30 Charisma more, if only because I find all that Divine Might damage sexy. It's still a great build.  Not to drag this OT, but I think BGs should be given a bit more in the skillset department.  I don't feel that the mojority of their powers transfers to NWN all that well.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
