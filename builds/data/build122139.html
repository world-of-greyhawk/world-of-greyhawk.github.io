I was playing the hometown diablo mod for NWN, and came up with this idea. The basic concept is that with the diablo type unique drop code, you never really can be sure what goodie you are going to get, and so it is pointless to go for specialization and the critical path as these require you to commit to a specific weapon. There is nothing worse than being specialized in longsword and getting an uber drop rapier that you are reluctant to use because you poured so much of your build into your spec. Furthermore, most of the higher level stuff is immune to sneak, critical anyway. So I wanted to make a guy who could use any weapon he found and survive well against the mass legions of this kind of mod, and I wanted a build that was playable the entire way through and did not resort to gimmicks that made you play in gimp mode prior to reaching 40.<br><br>Start dwarf fighter, and take default attributes,<br><br>16str<br>13dex<br>18con<br>10int<br>10wis<br>7cha<br><br>Level like this<br><br>7 fighter<br>10 dwarf defender<br>3 rogue<br>20 dwarf defender<br><br>So you would finish at 7fighter, 3 rogue, 30 dd.<br><br>By 20 you have 11 feats to get (7 base + 4 from fighter).

I'd like to ressurect this post to see if there are any fresh takes. I was wondering what you gain by taking the 3rd rogue lvl. I was trying a similar build, but started thinking about epic weap. spec &amp; maybe taking 2 lvls rogue at 19-20 then a lvl of fighter epic. If it's only 1d6 more on the sneak att it could be a good trade off for me. Just wondering if I'm missing something Thx!<br>_________________<br>A black eye heals, but cowardice has a long shelf-life.<br>-Xander Harris

The feat that you MUST take epic is epic prowess.  Otherwise, good luck with it.<br><br>peace

Presumably the 3rd rogue level is for Uncanny Dodge I.  That's generally the reason many builds that take a few rogue levels take 3 of them (especially for dex based builds).<br><br>Steve

Thx for the replies. I guess I was a bit confused then, I thought I could take 1 lvl of fighter after lvl 20 &amp; get the option for epic weapon spec. Still ending up at fighter8/rogue2/DwD30. But you're saying I need to actually be an Epic fighter specifically(20+lvls of fighter) to get access to it. Gotcha makes my decision easy then.

no, you don't have to be an epic fighter (20+lvls in class) to take Epic Weapon specialization.  However, in order to take 30 lvls of DwD, you have to take 20 in epic lvls, so you can never take a fighter lvl in epic.  <br><br>On another note, Since DwDs get that "can't be flanked" feat that I cannot remember the name of, I am not sure that Uncanny Dodge would be all that valuable to this specific build.  Evasion and the skill points for tumble might though.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.rpgmods.net/forgottenworlds/phpBB2/" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

At Lvl 5 Defensive Awareness (3 I think) means you can no longer be flanked, and indeed, attackers don't get sneak attacks against you when they flank you.  Pretty handy when surrounded by rogues.  5 levels of Dwarven Defender can be pretty handy in a build.

Hi Bilbo,<br><br><br>          First THANKS!! for sharing your build. I really like the idea of the survivalist type character. I have a question or just curious. If your going to have rogue in the build and only three levels. Why not take rogue at first level to get the max ability points for first level? Then also I'd space out the remaining two rogue levles at points in the build where you can max abilities with saved skill points between the rogue levels and have some better rogue skills during the leveling / life of the character. You take the three rogue levels at 18,19, and 20. I just don't understand why to take them all in a row like that. <br><br><br>                              Thanks again, Mano<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick. Long ago I learned to strike swiftly and without scruple. I trouble no man without cause, but one who attacks me had best resolve himself to die!
