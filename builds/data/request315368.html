I'm lookin' to expand my range of Halflings and Gnomes, and I was wonderin' if any of you fine folks have any build suggestions.  I'm a big fan of the little guys in theory, but my playstyle doesn't really match up w/ them.  Towards that end, I'm willing to bend, but mayhaps not to break.  <br><br>Pertinent info:<br>I can live w/ a 20% XP penalty, though obviously, if I can play a build where <i>only</i> the race in question can avoid the penalty, so much the better.<br>I prefer STR based builds.  Yes, I know.  On the bright side, it's fun to take advantage of the scimitar and rapier being two handed.<br>I don't like DEX builds.  Yes, I know.<br><br>I have, in the works:<br>halfling bard/fighter/RDD (Bullroarer w/ far more bard and an XP penalty)<br>halfling cleric/rogue (32/8, Wis based)<br>halfling fighter/rogue/SD (Dex based)<br>halfling fighter/rogue/CoT (Dex based)<br>gnome rogue/fighter/WM (Str based)<br><br>Gnome wizards is a no-brainer.  Mayhaps a gnome something/wiz/PM is in order.<br><br>Oh yeah.  Environment (WoG...) is lowish-mid magic, +5 max, some immunities available, little perma-anything available, some scrolls, wands, etc.

personally, i LOVE cd's build though its a bit old (circa 2004).  The famous Cleric/bard/rdd.  With the short dudes, and wanting str you cant go wrong with rdd.  But i like the cleric/rog idea with zen archery and a slingin halfling..

This is my favorite halfling build, known as Xan Bladesinger on WoG:<br> <br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "253741", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pale Sneaker of Doom - Rogue 24 / Bard 6 / Pale Master 10</a> or you might want to try the "paler" version Rogue 20/Bard 4/PM 16 which renounces to SCV and goes for EW and EMA.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

I was just lookin' those guys up...  I thought I remembered something similar, but w/ far more bard levels, and fewer rogue, but I find no reference in the build search engine.  This is Xan's build, no?<br><br>Is there a template already made up for the PM16 version?  Methinks I'd go for that.

onioneater, have you ever played around with a Halfling Cleric/Rogue/X (SD/Assassin/CoT, etc) Zen Archery Dart/Sling user with Divine Might?<br>_________________<br>It's fear of god that brought us to that state.<br>How fortunate the man with none.<br><br>Bertold Brecht

I have not, but methinks I should.  I'm very comfortable with divine casters, and am quite used to spending points on stats other than wisdom.  I do also love me some divine damage.  I'm just not convinced what point the X serves, other than SD.  I suppose that's enough.<br><br>Halfling cleric of Olidimmara comin' right up.

Yeah, actually looking now the Assassin suggestion does seem moot... But CoT would give you some extra Great WIS and Discipline, HS some extra Great CHA and Discipline also. Have fun!<br><br>PS I really like these guys better with darts, for some extra oomph in damage.
