Looking for a High AB and AC Smiter.<br><br>The Server I play on is High Magic server, Dev Crit is <br>allowed. It has a socket system that lets you build <br>weapons up to +20. Plenty of +6 armour, shields, boots, <br>etc abound.  I am a member of a good  guild that is<br>going to war with evil guild. Made up of Pm's, Blackguards, assissins, etc etc.

If you want to smite, you need Great Smite... which means 25+ Charisma, which means... lots of feats spent on Cha... which means... low non-smite AB!<br><br>If you want to get really high smite damage and have a high AB you're sh*t out of luck.<br><br>You can get your AC bonus from Divine Shield (charisma bonus to dodge ac for as many rounds as the modifier) but having to stand and activate it mid battle? Not good.<br><br>I tested a couple of builds for smiting, and a Paladin Sorc CoT worked incredibly well coupled with Timestop, ouch... and Cleric Paladin CoT worked with WoF smites quite nicely too, both killing Palemasters pretty much in one round.<br><br>Smiters are very limited, even if you go for Paladin 29 Sorc 1 RDD 10 giving you that all important strength boost, and you'll never really get a high non smite AB or AC with any of them.<br><br>The Sorc Paladin CoT build I used had Great Smite X, Timestop, and all the elemntal shields.<br><br>After popping out and wiping out the enemy, He would re-sanctuary and then pick low AC targets or use various spells and taunt to lower the enemy ac and perhaps get them to attack his acid sheath.
