All I can say is, this is one of those guilty pleasure builds.  You start a monster, and you end a monster.  UMD and the great Rogue skill set, WS/EWS, Devastating Critical, Improved Evasion, Crippling Strike and 9d6sneak, 1.5 2-hander damage, and a high Taunt skill, all combine to make him a menace to most PvM societies.  Further, even though 3 core classes and Half-orc (one of the hardest races to multiclass) are chosen, there is no XP-penalty anywhere in the build.  Barbarian levels are taken every 5 levels for Taunt Skill dumps.<br><br><br><b>Shock and Awe</b><br><br>Barbarian7/Rogue17/Ftr16<br>Race: Half-orc<br>Alignment: Any non-lawful<br>Playable: 1-40, PvM environments with Dev Crit enabled<br>Not Recommended for PvP<br><br><b>Attrbutes</b><br>Str18 (32)<br>Int12<br>Wis8<br>Con16<br>Dex12<br>Chr6<br><br><b>Levelling Guide</b><br>1 Rogue1, Luck of Heroes<br>2 Fighter1, WF: Greatsword<br>3 Rogue2,  Power Attack<br>4 Fighter2, Cleave, Str19<br>5 Barbarian1<br>6 Fighter3, Knockdown<br>7 Rogue3<br>8 Fighter4, WS: Greatsword, Str20<br>9 Rogue4, Lightning Reflexes<br>10 Barbarian2<br>11 Fighter5<br>12 Rogue5, Iron Will, Str21<br>13 Fighter6, Blindfighting<br>14 Rogue6<br>15 Barbarian3, Improved Critical: Greatsword<br>16 Fighter7, Str22<br>17 Rogue7<br>18 Fighter8, Great Cleave, Toughness<br>19 Rogue8<br>20 Barbarian4, Str23<br>21 Fighter9, Great Str I<br>22 Rogue9<br>23 Rogue10, Improved Evasion<br>24 Fighter10, Overwhelming Crit, Devastating Critical, Str25<br>25 Barbarian5<br>26 Fighter11<br>27 Rogue11, EWF: Greatsword<br>28 Fighter12, EWS: Greatsword, Str26<br>29 Rogue12<br>30 Rogue13, Great Str II, Crippling Strike<br>31 Fighter13<br>32 Rogue14, Str28<br>33 Barbarian6, Great Str III<br>34 Fighter14, Armor Skin<br>35 Rogue15<br>36 Fighter15, Epic Will, Str30<br>37 Rogue16, ESF: Taunt<br>38 Fighter16, Epic Prowess<br>39 Rogue17, Great Str IV<br>40 Barbarian7, Str32<br><br><b>Vitals</b><br>AB: 43/38/33/28<br>Base Damage: 2-12+22 (17-20/x2+2d6) +9d6sneak<br>Dev Crit DC: 41<br>AC: 30 (mundane Full Plate)<br>HP: 528<br><br><b>Saves</b><br>Fort: 26 (28)<br>Will: 20 (22)<br>Reflex: 22 (24)<br><br><b>Skills:</b>  263<br>Tumble: 40<br>Taunt: 43 (51)<br>UMD: 37 (35)<br>Spellcraft: 9 (10)<br>Search: 10<br>Disable Traps: 19 (20)<br>Set Traps: 19 (20)<br>Open Locks: 15 (16)<br>Discipline: 40 (51)<br>Craft Armor: 15 (16)<br>Craft Weapon: 5 (6)<br>____________<br><br><b>Advantages</b><br>Barbarian Speed<br>Massive Damage<br>UMD &amp; Rogue Skill Set<br>Epic Taunt Skill<br>Improved Evasion<br>Crippling Strike / 9d6sneak<br>Devastating Critical<br>Barbarian Rage x2/day<br><br><b>Disadvantages</b><br>Mediocre Saves (well, something had to give)<br>Dev Crit build--environments are rare<br>___________<br><br>In spite of the 17 Rogue levels, this character was not meant for stealth.  Nor does he rely on nor depend upon Sneak Attacks.  However, that is always an option, and one can still generate Sneaks either through Knockdown, Flanking, or attacking while Invisible.  When I built him, I had a rich to semi-rich scroll environment in mind.  Stealth is still an option, though, and a worthy alternative, especially in a non-dev crit environment, in which one could give up the Dev-crit line in lieu of ESF Stealth feats, and then take your SF Stealth feats pre-epic in place of PA, Cleave, and Gr Cleave.  Leveling would remain the same, just switch out the feats where necessary, and then redistribute the skill points as needed (cannibalize Crafting and Spellcraft, while shaving from the top the rest of the skill set).<br><br>Finally, this is a fairly unique build.

Good catch, Avado. That was supposed to be Lightning Reflexes.  Somehow that missed the final cut.

Grizz, I should really change my profile so favored type of character reads any build by the Grizzled Dwarflord. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Was thinking another option with this monster might be to drop starting STR to 16 and raise INT to 16.

Yes I did mean INT 14.<br>And yes it is a large sacrifice in points.  But depending on the setting the extra versatility from skill points might be    <br>acceptable.  In fact you would have a few more skill points than I suggested in my above post as you could actualy put 1 point less into each of the crafting skills and 2 points less into Spellcraft and still achieve the same modified checks.<br><br>I suppose it would depend on where you wanted to play.  I can think of a couple of modules where Traps were not available for purchase, and a Persistant world or two where merchants who had trap crafting supplies were much more easily found (and considerably cheaper) than merchants who sold traps.<br><br>Finally I should note, I don't consider this an improvement of your build.  It is only another alternative.  In a straight up fight it's a watering down.<br><br>Lastly oh DwarfLord you are the reason I don't have many builds on these boards.
