(I also created a Dex-based version using Wizard as the base class.  I didn't like it as much, but I will post it later after some tweaking)<br><br>The AB on this build is pretty average for a melee build, and even with buffs, it is mediocre at best.  Darkfire, and Divine Favor help a bit with damage, though.  Plus you have a Shadowlord to help with the fighting. The Longsword was chosen for it's ubiquitousness on most mods and PW, you could swap if for any non-exotic weapon of your choice.  The Greatsword might be a nice alternative for the extra strength damage; or perhaps the Scimitar for the crit range.<br><br>With it's average stats, it should be considered a RP build and probably played as such.  It did, however, fair pretty well in the Novice to Epic mod.  And was able to deal with most enemies using just mundane equipment.  The Cleric class was chosen to give this build the extra combat buffs that it needs.<br><br>I personally feel that the ShadowDancer class really shines best when it is coupled to a non-rogue class.  In ten levels, you get most of the really good defensive rogue feats and a few other ShadowDancer abilities as well.  Of particular note: Tumble, Improved Evasion, Slippery Mind, Search, Spot, 6 skill points per level, ShadowEvade and ShadowDaze.<br><br>With 29 levels of ShadowDancer, your ShadowEvade will net you: 16/+6 damage reduction and a +4 AC bonus (30 levels would give you 18/+7, but I thought that the extra 4th and 5th level Cleric spell were more important).<br><br>I took Skill focus Hide to make up for the armor penalties, and in testing I found that I was able to successfully slip in and out of stealth in full armor and a tower shield without much trouble.  And even if not, I could usually HiPS until they "lost" me.<br><br>The Epic ShadowLord is a Figher-class Shadow.  There is a bug that doesn't give it the Concealment that it should have, so make sure to cast Improved Invisibility on it to compensate.  I also buffed it with Empowered Bulls and Stoneskin.  You can also cast Darkfire on it, but it only affects the 1st of the 3 attack types it cycles through.  It is still worth it in my opinion, though.  Also, Mage Armor and Stone Bones also give it an extra 6 AC.  All-in-all, its a pretty nice companion (or distraction) that levels nicely with the PC. <br>Here is a link by Syrath1001, where he has a great write-up of all the stats and immunites that the Shadowlord has.  <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "16203", "149783", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Again, it's not an Uber-build, and definitely has some shortfalls, but it was fun to test out in a few different environments and it seemed to have a nice mix of RP and battle-effectiveness.<br><br>Cheers.

I like this concept, I did a cleric/SD build that focused on the cleric end and it turned out pretty well.  One thing I'd note - the shadow's an undead, so if you want to heal him, you have to use negative energy spells.  Casting cure wounds spells will actually cause damage to him, or at least, it did when I tested it.  You'd want to heal him with spells like negative energy ray or cause wounds.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
