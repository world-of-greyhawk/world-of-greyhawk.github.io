Hello! I'm looking for a nice build that could dual wield Katanas <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   I've been looking and I couldn't really find any good ones. The build should also include devistating critical hit. *Nods*  So, would any of ye know of such a build? Or perhaps could someone make one up for me? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   <br><br>Also, I'm looking for a nice melee build that does well in PvP...What would be even better is if I could find a Dual Wielding Katana build that does well in PvP *grins* Anyway, dev crit is always a nice thing to have in PvP, or it could be a dexer! Due to my server, it can't be a Blackguard, Assassin, Pale Master, or RDD. I've already tried the Not So Dashing Swashbuckler, the 14 fighter/ 7 wm/ 19 SD It was alright, but not enough AB to take on those dev critters with like 25 levels in Weapon Master. Help would be very appreciated! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I just realized I probably posted this in the wrong section. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Endalyor on 12/11/06 16:05</span></i></p>

I built a katana dual wielder once. It was a Ranger/Rogue/Fighter split. The interesting thing was that he had more BAB than his level (he was level 12, his BAB was around 19). I don't know how that happened, but its definately a bug...<br><br>hrmm<br><br>*ponders about katanas*<br>_________________<br>They were all dead. The final gunshot was an exclamation mark to everything that had led up to this point. I released my finger from the trigger. And then it was all over. The storm seemed to lose its frenzy. The ragged clouds gave way to the stars above.
