I know, done to death and there are no doubt loads of these builds however i'm looking for something tailored and specific. Alot of the builds i've read borrow one class, one class there and i can't really make them fit what i'm looking for.<br><br>Right now my character is what i'd concider an average fighter... by no means a powerful build but she can hold her own in most cases. (stats can be posted on request though she is rather simple)<br><br>Just lately she has found faith and i figured the shift to cleric was too much and i wanted to keep her 'fighter' roots. The server i play on does have a few *grinds teeth* rules to building characters.<br><br>5 levels in each class minimum<br>(5 levels in each class taken before you reach level 20)<br>Levels capped at 30<br><br>My fighter at current is a dev critter, using a bastard sword (i like the weapon and makes a little girl look butch <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  ) Other than that she is pretty standard, tower shield, +5 full plate, haste, etc, etc. The world itself can be classed as a high magic world however attaining alot of the gear is a challenge in its self.<br><br>I guess i'm looking for a battle priest with a slightly high focus in the melee rather than the magic, though the basic buffs are handy.<br><br>I apologise if there is an answer to this already.<br><br>C

I have thought bout it, but there is NOTHIN anyone can do, intelligently, to answer your question without knowin a few things..  1) STATS! 2) lv current! 3) are you set on takin str to 25 for dev crit (which SERIOUSLY is the wrong way to take a buffer cleric/fighter imho).  and i know that you love the bsword, so do I, but if crits are your main thrust (dev crit) the crit range of the wpn isnt that great (17-20 for a ftr/cl build) and to get it better you need wm to 7.  <br><br>hope that helps out.

The stat pattern you have outlined is for melee, not a cleric.  Now, that said, there are several cleric/wm builds (look for my miserable dwarf) that are solid in combat with extensive buffs.  The problem i see with this is that you approach the game as a fighter (which is great), but by doin this you forfeit certain options, namely cleric, sorc or pally, or ranger.  I know it would be nice, but it is very hard to do a cleric/wm build with dev crit done in this way.<br><br>To get something like what you are asking for, you need to start like this (for human)<br>st 14 con 8 in 13 dex 13 wis 17 cha 8 (a dwrf gives con 10, ch 6  which is alot more useable by a fightr).<br><br>1-10 cleric (earth/healing)<br>11-14 fighter<br>15-19 cleric<br>20-26 weapon master<br>27 fightr<br>28-30 weapon master<br><br>cleric 15/ftr5/wm10<br>Ends with a str of 20, taking 1 wisdom at lv 12.  For feats you take all wm requirements (i took wf dwrafaxe, so thats an extra feat) and toughness.  Epic feats  in this order  epic wf, extend spell (w/ 15 cleric lvls you need this for buffs), epic wpn spec, epic prowess.<br><br>That is the best you could do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 05/31/05 03:43</span></i></p>

You don't gain anything special from those last 3 levels of weapon master.  WM get their +1 AB bonuses on level 5 (Superior Weapon Focus) and 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28 (Epic Superior Weapon Focus).  It's one of the few prestige classes that gets nothing at level 10.  So, taking those last 3 levels as fighter instead will give you 2 additional feats but the same exact AB, AC, saves, etc. (except of course whatever bonuses your 2 additional feats give you).<br><br>I'd also drop your starting wisdom from 17 to 16 and raise con to 10.  Even with con boosting spells and toughness, 8 is a bit low.  You would need to sink another point into wisdom during leveling, which means your strength would end at 19 instead of 20, but that's not a huge deal for a cleric build.  And anyway, switching those last levels to fighter netted you 2 extra fighter bonus feats, so you can probably take a feat you would have taken as a general feat as a fighter bonus feat instead, freeing up space for a great strength if you really want it (although you're probably going to already have plenty of feats to feel those extra spaces that are better than that).<br><br>Steve<br><br>Edit: And of course, you need to move 1 more fighter level and 4 more WM levels pre-epic than avado had, since you need at least 5 in each class pre-epic to meet the requirements of your world.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 05/31/05 06:32</span></i></p>

Interesting builds and i will try them out however i know my current build can not go into fighter/cleric... hence remaking her from the ground up and starting over.<br>WM does give some nice advantages but for some reason i've never been over popular of the class, perhaps this has to do with liking pure builds too much on my part.<br><br>My basic idea was for a straight fighter/cleric... i would think about paladin as a holy warrior but the class is so underpowered in certain areas that you need to mix and match classes just to gain a strong build... which i can not do.<br><br>Thanks for the builds though.

Just a note: i posted the above in error!  I am sorry about the wm thing!   you never asked about wm.  I was lookin at another build just before i posted and i then went to yours, so i was thinkin of 2 entirely different questions.<br><br>If you want to do a fightr/cleric then id suggest this sorta thing<br><br>Str 16 dex 12 con 12 wis 15 int 12 cha 10 (just guessin at this, but it should be close <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  )<br><br>You can keep the str and wisdom high and leave the rest near base if you like.  They are all that really matters.  The other stat is charisma (if you want to use turnin or the divine feats), otherwise just worry bout str and wisdom.<br><br>YOu need wisdom to bout 17 (at least) for this type of build.  THere are nice spells after lv 7, but no major buffs. (take WAR domain for aura of vitality).  YOu Definitely want to take Extend spell to make the buffs last longer (id suggest good as other domain for stoneskin at lv 4 spells).  This means that you need to get cleric to lv 13, 15 if you want to get wisdom to 18 (which is the best idea..  great magic wpn is +5 then).  <br><br>By not worrying bout any other class (like wm) you can focus on ftr/cleric exclusive.  Id suggest a 15/15 split, with pre epic 5ftr/15 cleric.   That gives you 5 bonus feats postepic.<br><br>Again i spologize for any confusion.<br><br>Peace

I'd probably approach this building challenge with something more like a 12/8 cleric/fighter split pre epic and finish with something like 20/10 at level 30, this should give you a few nice feats, preserve BAB to some extent and possibly give epic weapon specialisation with a couple of weapons.  Id probably neglect charisma completely (cha <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif">  and take the trickery and strength (or possibly war) domains, because IMO this type of character build tends to lend itself more towards a "superpowered fighter" rather than a "priest with battle training" concept.  regards the stats, Id start with something like Str 14, Dex 12, Con 12, Wisdom 16, Int 14 and Cha 8 (hope these add up), then proceede with taking Str to about 18 and wisdom to 20 or so.

AGREED!  I just love clerics alot <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  and i want to get the buff spells as early as possible.  I agree totally with you comment about my build bein a battle priest not a fightr, and imho if i was gonna do as requested, id choose your path.<br><br>Peace
