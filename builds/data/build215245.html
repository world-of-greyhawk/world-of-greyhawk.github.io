<b>Playable PvM (1-40) low-mid magic world, PvP (1-40).</b><br><br>I wanted to build a dual-wielder that could deal a lot of damage from all 3 phyiscal damage types, so The Tendorizing Tenor came forth. Blessed with great strength and a bunch of buffs that he really only needs for the tough fights he can literally chop his opponent down to size. and although Fighter/ Bard/ RDD builds have been made, I didn't see any similar to this. I have made a pure melee and DevCrit version of this build to suit any world's (or player's) fancy. I prefer the non-DevCrit one... but both get the job done.<br><br>Advantages: 6 attacks standard, lvl 16 Bard Song and Curse Song, Taunting, Lvl 6 Bard spells, 32 Strength base, Good AC along with Improved Invisiblity, WINGS!!!!, Immunity to Sleep, Fire and Paralysis, the ability to be an amazing pack mule with over 2000 lbs of stuff, build gets stronger with time.<br><br>Disadvantages: Saves not wonderful, AC leaves you open to attacks from strong creatures with Good sight, build gets stronger with time.<br><br>Race: Human<br>Class: Fighter 14/ Bard16/ Red Dragon Disciple 10<br>ST 14 (32)<br>DX 14 (15)<br>CO 14 (16)<br>WI 8 <br>IN 14 (16)<br>CH 14 (16)<br><br>Level Class Notes<br>1 Fighter (1) Power Attack, WF(Handaxe), WF(Mace)<br>2 Bard (1)<br>3 Fighter (2) Cleave, Two-Weapon Fighting<br>4 Fighter(3) Dex(15)<br>5 Bard (2) <br>6 Fighter (4) WS (Handaxe), WS(Mace)<br>7 RDD (1) <br>8 RDD (2) Str(15)<br>9 RDD (3) Ambidexterity<br>10 RDD (4)<br>11 Fighter (5)<br>12 Bard (3) I2WF, Str(20)<br>13 RDD (5)<br>14 RDD (6)<br>15 RDD (7) Toughness<br>16 RDD (8) Str (21)<br>17 Bard (4)<br>18 Fighter (6) IC(Handaxe), IC(Mace)<br>19 Fighter (7)<br>20 Fighter (8) Great Cleave, Str(22)<br><br>Epic Level Class Notes<br>21 RDD (9) EWF(Handaxe)<br>22 RDD (10)<br>23 Bard (5)<br>24 Bard (6) EWF(Mace), Str(27)<br>25 Bard (7)<br>26 Fighter (9) <br>27 Fighter (10) EWS(Handaxe), EWS(Mace)<br>28 Bard (8) Str(28)<br>29 Fighter (11)<br>30 Fighter (12) Knockdown, IKD<br>31 Fighter (13)<br>32 Bard (9) Str(29)<br>33 Bard (10) Curse Song<br>34 Bard (11)<br>35 Bard (12)<br>36 Fighter (14) Armor Skin, Epic Prowess, STR(30)<br>37 Bard (13)<br>38 Bard (14)<br>39 Bard (15) Great Str(31)<br>40 Bard (16) STR (32)<br><br>HP- 400+ <br>AB- Base (Fully Buffed)<br>Main Hand (Handaxe) 1-6+17 40/35/30/25 (1-6+19, +5 Slash, +3 Bludgeon, +2 Slash 51/46/41/36)<br>Offhand (Mace) 1-6+11 40/35 (1-6+12 +5 Slash, +3 Bludge, +2 Slash 51/46)<br><br>AC (in Full Plate)- 33 (41)<br><br>Saves- Fort 26(35) [28(37)], Reflex 20(29) [22(31)], Will 21(30) [23(32)]<br><br>* Not crucial to the build<br><br>Level Class Notes<br>1 Fighter (1) Power Attack, WF(Handaxe), WF(Mace)<br>2 Bard (1)<br>3 Fighter (2) Cleave, Two-Weapon Fighting<br>4 Fighter(3) Dex(15)<br>5 Bard (2) <br>6 Fighter (4) WS (Handaxe), WS(Mace)<br>7 RDD (1) <br>8 RDD (2) Str(15)<br>9 RDD (3) Ambidexterity<br>10 RDD (4)<br>11 Fighter (5)<br>12 Bard (3) Curse Song, Str(20)<br>13 RDD (5)<br>14 RDD (6)<br>15 RDD (7) I2WF<br>16 RDD (8) Str (21)<br>17 Bard (4)<br>18 Fighter (6) IC(Handaxe), IC(Mace)<br>19 Fighter (7)<br>20 Fighter (8) Great Cleave, Str(22)<br><br>Epic Level Class Notes<br>21 RDD (9) EWF(Handaxe)<br>22 RDD (10)<br>23 Bard (5)<br>24 Bard (6) EWF(Mace), Str(27)<br>25 Bard (7)<br>26 Fighter (9) <br>27 Fighter (10) EWS(Handaxe), EWS(Mace)<br>28 Bard (8) Str(28)<br>29 Fighter (11)<br>30 Fighter (12) OC(Handaxe), DC(Handaxe)<br>31 Fighter (13)<br>32 Bard (9) Str(29)<br>33 Bard (10) OC(Mace)<br>34 Bard (11)<br>35 Bard (12)<br>36 Fighter (14) DC(Mace), Epic Prowess, STR(30)<br>37 Bard (13)<br>38 Bard (14)<br>39 Bard (15) Great Str(31)<br>40 Bard (16) STR (32)<br><br>AB- Same as above<br>AC- 31<br>Saves are the same as well.<br><br>DevCrit DC- 41<br><br>*You also lose 40 HP from Toughness this way as well.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 10/07/05 21:49</span></i></p>

SHOOT! I forgot to put my Longbow stats... all my characters typically carry one or a xbow since creatures can run and apparently climb to places you can't get...
