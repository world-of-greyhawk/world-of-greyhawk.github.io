I will, however, quote them. <br><br>- Raging Skald (Cinnabar Din)<br><br>- The Mighty and Terrifying and Thundering Gnomish Barbarian (FinneousPJ)<br><br>- Fireblooded Rager (Jennalee)<br><br>- Musclehead (jjellison)<br><br>- Axe Thrower v2 (jockeb)<br><br>- Blunt Force Trauma (SwordDog)<br><br>- Dragon Blade (TyrTemplar)<br><br>- Dragon Rider (TyrTemplar)<br><br>The main difference between this build and the others above is that the other builds focus on one or two aspects of barbarians, and neglect the rest. Some have DevCrit, but no EDR, others have the rages and EDR, but no DevCrit, so on and so forth. This guy, on the other hand, isn't THE BEST at one specific thing, but knows a bit of everything and can use this well-roundedness to srike his opponents where they're weak. Here's what I mean by well-rounded:<br><br>- Has KD and a good STR modifier, but no IKD.<br><br>- Low AC (No Heavy Armor Proficiencies or Armor Skin, which I listed as "nice to have" feats, but this guy has too many must haves, so I couldn't afford them...). Has 15/- points of DR and a decent amount of HP to compensate this. Also, enough UMD to use +5 Dodge Monk Boots helps a lot.<br><br>- Has low Will and Reflex saves (I tried to work out as many spellcraft ranks as I could, maybe on a lower magic environment, you can drop UMD down to 31 and still get to use the best items and then get 35 Spellcraft to increase your saves vs spells by 1), but again, having enough UMD to get scrolls with the right immunities is the best way to go. <br><br>- Has good AB, but no Epic Prowess or Taunt (the maximum Taunt ranks I could squeeze in was 34, by dropping Spellcraft and Perform altogether, but then you can't Taunt the toughest foes, and against mobs you don't need it, so no point in getting it. Unless, of course, you want to use it from levels 1-17, getting a total of 20 ranks to make your life easier levelling up, and then completely forget about it as you walk into the epic levels. If so, drop Spellcraft).<br><br>- Has Terrifying Rage, 43 ranks of Intimidate, but no SF/ESF.<br><br>- Has Devastating Critical, but the DC is average (41 normal and 47 enraged). His DevCrit won't kill as often, but wielding a Greatsword with Thundering Rage and Overwhelming critical, your criticals will hurt regardless. <br><br>I found a well-rounded Half-Orc to be an appealing concept. Just noting before someone decides to point out the obvious: a human version with the exact same feats could also max out Taunt, Spellcraft, get IKD with the extra feat, have no Int penalty, while losing 2 STR and getting DevCrit at 27 instead of 24, but the point of this build was to make a well-rounded Half-Orc. <br><br>Constructive criticism is very appreciated, thanks.<br><br>Take it EZ!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 05/27/10 20:42</span></i></p>

@ avado<br><br>Thanks, good to be back <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>@ Grim<br><br>Yeah, but everytime I see a Half-Orc Barb, it's a MAX STR one-trick pony. It's as if the class is only good for that purpose and nothing else (which kinda is true, sadly). This build tries as hard as possible to build a Half-Orc that can be taken seriously without relying only on DevCrit with an IMBA DC.<br><br>@ anyone else<br><br>Could someone please teach me how to add links to a post? I wanna follow the rules, but it's hard when you don't know the tools.. Thanks!<br><br>Take it EZ!

Addendum:<br><br>I was playing with this guy recently, and found out that it's very expensive to level him up if you don't take Armor Proficiency (Heavy). His AC is 16 with a mundane Breastplate, 14 with Rage. <br><br>He kills things fast enough, so he doensn't die, but gets hit in every battle unless he kills the incoming aggressor with an AoO. That means A LOT of gold on healing potions. There are 3 ways to solve this problem:<br><br>1- Walk around alongside a Cleric or have a Cleric Henchman.<br><br>2- Drop Blind Fight and get Armor Proficiency (Heavy) at level 1, and rearranging your feats as follows:<br>     1- Armor Proficiency (Heavy)<br>     3- Power Attack<br>     6- Cleave<br>     9- Improved Critical (Greatsword)<br>     12- Knockdown<br>     15- Great Cleave<br>     18- Weapon Focus (Greatsword)<br><br>3- Walk around with a shield for the first few levels. The downside to this is that you won't be applying 1.5x your STR bonus to dmg, which is a shame with 18 starting STR.<br><br>Well, that's pretty much the only problem I've had. Low saves is something that you can't fix, so better to walk around with 1 or 2 clarity potions just to be sure <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Take it EZ!
