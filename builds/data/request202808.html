I've seen people (mainly those who have windows and linux) come online with hacked characters. Well I was wondering if someone could make me a character that has a nice set of wings? Yeah I know, why bother when I can just get some with a level 9 rdd? 2 reasons. Reason 1, I don't want red wings. Reason number 2. I want my character to be a pure cleric. I have all of the information for my character, I just need some one to add the wings (prefarbly white).<br><br>Name: Just pick something, I can always change it later.<br>Sex: Female<br>Race: Human<br>Sub-race: Silver Dragon<br>God: Aasterinian<br>Class: Cleric<br>Main Weapon: Katana<br>Str: 13<br>Dex:10<br>Cons:12<br>Wis:15<br>Int:13<br>Chra:14     <br>(if you know of some better stats then change them, but I want to have a high level Wis, Int, and Chra)<br>Cleric Domains:<br>Healing<br>War<br><br>Your help would be greatly appreciated <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  .<br>Thanks!<br><br>P.s.

I wouldnt say it is hacking a character, just giving him CEP special features:<br><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Other.Detail&amp;id=713" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br>_________________<br>Over Seven Years of High Quality RP. <a href="http://www.mytharria.org" target="_blank">www.mytharria.org</a> We offer a unique world with player based religions &amp; governments.

iirc Exotic weapon feat requires 1 base attack; so only fighter-type classes can start out at first level being able to use the katana.  Cleric can only take exotic at lvl3.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 07/06/05 10:35</span></i></p>

Does that character creation work for macs??? I've been told that you have to wait until level three to use the katana, but that doesn't matter. I would prefer to level one feats

To answer my own question, no it is not. I have downloaded a cc that is compatiable for both linux users and macs, I just can't figure out how to work it.

I take it that this is just a place for suggestions, right? is it really that hard to put wings on a character without being a rdd
