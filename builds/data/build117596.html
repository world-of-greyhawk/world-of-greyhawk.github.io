<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM</b><br><br>Well this build should own every other melee character.

And if it's up against other crit-immune characters, or characters with high Fortitude saves, it can always cast Hellball, use a scroll, or buff up with Epic Mage Armour and Epic Warding and slug it out til the end.<br><br>Plus it has something like 38 AC naked, decent saves, 3 attacks per round unlike some PM builds, a nice critical threat roll, Bard Song buffs, 4th level Bard spells and can summon a Ghoul King. And did I mention it gets both the skeletal arm AND the dragon wings?

Why take mobility, spring attack, whirlwind attack, and improved whirlwind attack?  You would be able to get Dev Crit at lvl 24 that way.  I have a much similar build, and it works great as is.  You said it was based on a weapon master build, are these feats you just forgot to take out?  Oh wait, I imagine Herbie doesn't read here, if someone else can fill a brother in that'd be great.

Actually I just joined the guild about a week ago, better late than never I guess.<br><br>I made this build originally as an improvement on Torias' Whirling Death build, which is featured on Bioware's Epic Character Build page. I love playing that character (only I use a scimitar, not a rapier) but I found it got destroyed fairly often when faced by really big gangs of monsters. You see, it takes a whole round to fire off its Improved Whirlwind Attack, and so it has to put up with at least one round of attacks thrown in its direction. Whirling Death doesn't have the greatest AC or HP in the world so quite often I'd die before getting that all important IWWA off, especially if some of the attacks were criticals.<br><br>My build posted above is the same kind of one trick pony, able to annihilate large groups of baddies thanks to Dev Crit and IWWA, but it also has a few more defensive capabilities thanks to the PM levels, most notably Immunity to Criticals and Epic Warding.<br><br>I have actually posted a few more general purpose Bard / RDD / PM builds, but I'm not sure if they're indexed or not. I might have promised to do a write up of my favourite one ages ago, I don't remember, but the concept is so simple and has already been done to death, you can't really go too far wrong with it.

bard/rdd/pm is far from one trick pony my friend.  a self buffing (dev) critting machine with a rapier or a scim is always nice.  my current build gets a decent ab, and a decent (for my PW) ac of 50.  a good solid all around build, especially if you factor the bard song into play.  i'd like to look at more of your bard/rdd/pm builds, i've never written up my toon, but i have to imagine it is quite similar.  i understand now i think that this was more of a PvM toon,and not a PvP one, also that it is more of a themed build then i first thought.

Well I have two main "flavours" of this build. I played one a low-magic world with Tony K's improved AI hak installed. That one was bard 8 / RDD 10 / PM 22 and got 5 epic spells and a massive AC. 22 PM meant it got to summon a Lich, and an Ancient Red Dragon (Dragon Knight epic spell). With the improved AI, these two were actually worthwhile. The Lich would cast Greater Dispelling on anything that was buffed, and Finger of Death at anything that wasn't. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  The dragon would spam Improved Knockdown with every hit. It was awesome!<br>I used a gnome, and i think it started with stats<br>Str 14<br>Dex 12<br>Con 16<br>Int 10<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 12<br>specialising in a scimitar of course. But this version was only really useful on that PW, because the summons are useless unless the improved AI is installed, which it rarely is.<br><br>The more common one is the Bard 14 / RDD 10 / PM 16. I got three epic spells with it, Hellball, Epic Mage Armour, and Epic Warding. Again it was a gnome, and I think the stats were pretty much the same. Compared to the one posted on this thread, it dropped a few pointless feats like Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack etc., and went for Curse Song, Extend Spell, Still Spell and Combat Casting too I think. I could be wrong about that though. I guess I could do a full write up, but it'll take me a while.<br><br>As you can probably guess, I picked gnome so I could use a scimitar but also get the 1.5x Str modifier added to the damage. As any Str-based RDD build gets at least +18 to Str from levelling up and the RDD ability bonuses, it doesn't really matter about starting with 14 Str. Unless you're going for as big a Dev Crit DC as you possibly can, but if you're interested in that, see my other thread. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">

Great Cleave is handy, you're right, but you don't get a Great Cleave when you kill something with Dev Crit, hence the need for IWWA. I agree that it is kind of impractical; that's why I left it out of my subsequent Bard / RDD / PM builds, which are more all-round characters rather than one trick ponies.<br><br>I did actually make a Bard 11 / RDD 10 / PM 19 version of this build. It was my favourite "flavour" for a while. But  the only advantage it really gets over the PM 16 version is an extra feat, and the only worthwhile thing you can spend it on is an epic spell. On most PWs, Epic Mage Armour is kind of useless and gives you only a +5 dodge bonus to AC, since you already have +5 or better equipment for all the other AC types. The summons are useless without the improved AI, so you're left with only 3 decent epic spells: Warding, Hellball and Greater Ruin, and even Greater Ruin isn't really that useful,since most things make their save agaisnt it. The Bard 14 / PM 16 version gets 3 epic spells, IIRC, so there's no point going for 19 PM levels.<br><br>Bard 14 also gets better Bard / Curse song effects and a 5th level bard spell, which is useful for a stilled War Cry or stilled Improved Invisibility. It's not much of an advantage, but it can certainly be used to good effect.

The reason that I enjoy this type of build is the ease at which one can engage in a fight.  I doesn't take so long as a full blown mage to prep, so if one gets jumped just strolling along, all he's gotta do is sing his song, down a haste pot, and start the *** whuppin.  Taking too many PM levels seems to stray away from this idea, my final result will probably be much less, more like 14 or so.  All in all, a bard/rdd/pm always seems to me that it should be a short casting long songing melee type.

Actually all three classes get their best bits by level 10. It's an awesome level 30 combo, but there's nothing extra being added, classwise (there are of course epic feats) after this point. I'd have thought that getting access to level 9 spells was more useful than a slightly better bard song, but I could easily be wrong.

Agreed Thorsson.  If i had a lvl 30 limit i'd take 10 of each.  I guess my whole questioning of the build was if there were MAJOR bennies of PM levels.  You have to get a decent CHA to cast higher bard spells, and that just doesn't seem worth it.  Wasted spell slots and wasted stat points with epic spells VRS. more RDD lvls for extra HP VRS. more bard lvls for better song and wider spread of skill points.  All down to what you want to do.  I'm not an expert in the field, I was just looking for a better reason then the obvious to use so many PM lvls.  Fair enough.

It is with RDD, but PM comes into the extra boost of level 16 being able to take epic mage armor and epic warding. That alone makes a average defense a great one. Two more levels of bard will max out bardsong, not to mention you are overlooking bard spells which can be very useful.

Certainly Epic Warding is worth having. Epic Mage Armor is more debateable.

I would definately not call it a weak spellcaster. Also comparing bard spells to wiz/sorc is sort of like comparing apples to oranges. They are all arcane spells and some even overlap between all the classes, but some overlap with divine spells too. The point of bard spells is utility and not killing bad guys. On a build like this you already have the killing part covered with dev critting scimitars, so utility comes in very handy to make that killing part that much better. <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;As you get Epic Mage Armor is Tumble so important as to give up what could be yours if you invested all the spare points into Int and took Wizard instead?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->That would be a call based ont he player and situation.

I'll follow the 'Dilbert rules' of arguing with you about a good build is a build based on items.

Some worlds have faster levelling and little magic items. Its all about balance. <br><br>Also remember that the baseline that was originally used to determine an Epic Build on the bioware site was that of a build with no equipment. <br><br>Most of the builds I have made do not qualify for that since they require items to be effective. So does that make them invalid to be posted here , no, since here we can find builds that dont need items, do need items and everything in between. Doesnt stop this build from being pretty good. <br><br>Syrath

Fair comment.<br><br>My point though, is that certain things are present on almost every world. A build that ignores this is just as limited as a build that depends on the "7331", like the ones I see that casually mention +20 weapons.<br><br>BTW if you know of a world with reasonably quick levelling (i.e. at OC levels) and low magic items please tell me. I find most worlds not run by the anally retentive have ridiculous levels of magic.

If you look closely at the build mentioning those +20's it is more of a suplimentary information item, than an item that the build depends on. If you gear a build to a specific PW that's fine, but the poor guy who likes your build and tries it somewher else to have it fail miserable, won't be to happy. It's understood many builds will be using items of various degrees, but a build shouldn't rely on a specific item or two.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

I wouldn't say that elf variations of this are pointless, as I play with one myself.  Elves can be str based, there is no hard rule saying that all elves must be dexers.  Using elf, you dont have to waste a feat on Martial Weps and can still use a rapier or long sword, of course Rapier being the prefered wep.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

lol isn't it simple to make it a dex build?<br>just put all the points into dex. <br>You'll get + 10 str from the RDD anyway, so the STR won't be bat either, and just weapon focus some dex weapon like Rapier or Scimitar?<br><br>wouldn't that make it better, i'm not goof at working out stat could someone see if that would work?

I guess you could make it a dex char, but it wouldn't make it better.  Thats +8 to str by RDD levels, btw.  IMO, its a waste of time making a dexer that doesnt have epic dodge and self conceal feats.  You have to have something to off set the fact that you wont be doing alot of damage to opponents.  This char would never be able to get Epic dodge, and conversely, self conceal.  Trust me, strength is the only way to go with this type of build.  Not to say that you can't make a dexer with the build, but it will be weaker than the str version.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.
