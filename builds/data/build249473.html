Tal tended the graveyards of the city as a young man and was known for his care and diligence in his work.  His dealing with the locals was a bit more strained; he was known for his temper and sulkiness but generally was well liked.  He was always kind to the visitors paying their respects to their ancestors.  One day, however, Tal didn’t return from work.  A search came up empty.  Undead sightings in the area increased and the townsfolk avoided the graveyards.  Tal was gone to never heard from again…until…<br><br>Twenty years later a cousin of Tal’s was passing by the graveyard and saw a man tending a grave site.  Curious, since no one had touched the graveyard since Tal’s disappearance, the cousin approached the man clad in simple grey robes.  In horror, the man recognized his cousin Tal!  He looked as if he hadn’t aged a day, his skin held a grayish tone, and his dark eyes where empty and cold.  The long lost cousin didn’t say a word, didn’t seem to recognize his old cousin, and simply went about his work.<br><br>Frightened by the encounter, the cousin ran off to tell the others.  When they returned, no one was found.  Thinking the man drunk, the townsfolk dismissed the sighting.  However, from time to time folks have seen a young man in grey robes tending to the gravesites and some have even seen him “conversing” with the undead that still roam the walled site.  Since the sightings began, attacks from the undead have stopped, and the graveyard has taken on a more pristine and manicured look.  To this day, they credit the changes to the new and strange “Deathwarden.”  <br><br>Playable 1-40 PvM.  A variation on a theme, this character takes much of his PM levels pre-epic, although retains 4 attacks per round by 20th level.  Tough decision to go for the terrifying rage or more PM levels for epic spells.  Chose the rage since it makes for interesting RP for this character.  <br><br>Barbarian(22), Bard(6), Pale Master(12), Neutral, Human<br><br>01: Bard(1): Power Attack, Cleave<br>02: Bard(2)<br>03: Bard(3): Weapon Focus,  <br>04: Barbarian(1): STR+1, (STR=16)<br>05: Barbarian(2): Bb: (Uncanny Dodge I)<br>06: Pale Master(1): Great Cleave<br>07: Pale Master(2)<br>08: Pale Master(3): STR+1, PM: (Darkvision), (STR=17)<br>09: Pale Master(4): Knockdown<br>10: Pale Master(5)<br>11: Pale Master(6)<br>12: Barbarian(3): STR+1, Improved Knockdown, (STR=18)<br>13: Barbarian(4)<br>14: Barbarian(5)<br>15: Barbarian(6): Improved Critical<br>16: Barbarian(7): STR+1, (STR=19)<br>17: Barbarian(8)<br>18: Barbarian(9): Blind Fight<br>19: Barbarian(10)<br>20: Barbarian(11): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>21: Bard(4): Epic Skill Focus: Intimidate,  <br>22: Pale Master(7)<br>23: Pale Master(8)<br>24: Pale Master(9): STR+1, Epic Weapon Focus, (STR=21)<br>25: Pale Master(10)<br>26: Barbarian(12)<br>27: Barbarian(13): Armor Skin<br>28: Barbarian(14): STR+1, (STR=22)<br>29: Barbarian(15)<br>30: Barbarian(16): Epic Skill Focus: Taunt<br>31: Barbarian(17)<br>32: Barbarian(18): STR+1, (STR=23)<br>33: Barbarian(19): Great Strength I,  , (STR=24)<br>34: Barbarian(20)<br>35: Barbarian(21)<br>36: Barbarian(22): STR+1, Terrifying Rage,(STR=25)<br>37: Pale Master(11)<br>38: Pale Master(12)<br>39: Bard(5): Epic Toughness I<br>40: Bard(6): STR+1,  , (STR=26)<br><br>STR: 15 (26)<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 12<br><br>Hitpoints: 490<br>Skillpoints: 277<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 25/20/20<br>BAB: 26<br>AB (max, naked): 37/33/29/25 (melee), 28 (ranged)<br>Damage: 1D6+12 with mundane weapon<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 29/29<br>Spell Casting: Bard(2)<br><br>Discipline 32(40), Heal 43(42), Intimidate 37(48), Perform 21(22), Spellcraft 36(38), Taunt 35(46), Tumble 36(38), UMD 21(22)<br>_________________<br>TeoDeathDealer<br>Member of SoulForge PW (Action)

Terrifying rage can be obtained by only 15 bbn levels, so if you want you can get both. Something must be wrong with your AC numbers. Naked AC 29, which is the same AC you get with armour and shield?

Long time, no see, Teo.  Let's get to it.  It seems like an interesting RP build, and you leave a lot of room for improvement without sacrificing your RP choices.<br><br>As stated, TR can be attained with Barb15.  You can take Barb16 for 1 more GR a day, and Barb17 for 1 more DR a day.  So, you can easily stop at Barb17, and then take PM16.  More AC, 2 epic bonus feats, and access to Epic Spells.  With this in mind you can go Barb17/Bard7/PM16, or perhaps even better, Barb 16/Bard4/PM20 for 3 bonus feats and +12 AC.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Excellent gentleman!  Great advice as always.  I will go the 17/7/16 route.  I didn't know you could get terrifying rage at 15.  Good news indeed!<br><br>As for the AC, I wish I knew.  I use a spreadsheet I found on the net for my building, although I do play test the builds in a trainer module.  This fellow does get over 50 ac and possibly more with the right equipment.  With 16 PM, should be able to push 60.<br><br>Again, thanks for the look!  Cheers!
