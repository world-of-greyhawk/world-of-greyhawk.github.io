It's 26 lvls builds time for me. I should play the number at the lottery.  I've been recently fooling around with PM builds. Some combos have been done already, some others were not of my like. Mith pulled out the other build I was working on, with his <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "251640", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Eternal Knight</a>. <br><br>We've got a STR based, BoE Ranger here with quite an AC and Crit immunity, what to ask for more? UMD and Taunt? Here you go and for free you get listen too to counter those nasty sneakers. <br><br>You can easily choose to dual wield in light armor, your PM AC will make up for the DEX mod loss. DEX gear will make it even better.<br><br>One could start with STR 14, DEX 14 instead drop Heavy Armor for a feat of your choice (Stealthy?) and plan on a more stealthy approach to the build wearing light armor and going for dual wield. Move skillpoints to Hide/MS and get good use out of Ranger's Camouflage and One with the Land.<br><br>Saves are low, but are kinda decent vs spells. Save boosters are a must though. <br><br>You can still squeeze out 1 AB from the build if you feel so inclined by going all Ranger preepic; it costs playability and -3 Will/Ref saves though.

Well done Kail.  No suggestions from me this time, the build is pretty much the same build I would have come up with.  Pretty solid and playable all the way through  and your AB is pretty good against favored enemies.  Shame about the ranger spell list, but I guess some of them are useful.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

You should do a listing of the damage here, Kail. Cool build, wonder why I havenæt done it. Perhaps because I focus to much on the offense of the ranger to get decent defence. Like you said, BoE, crit immunity and extra AC from PM makes this an ideal dual-wielder. Do some tests on both and you'll see. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Great build no matter.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

I use this <a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/Thott/nwn/" target="_blank">Damage Calculator</a>, it's a good tool unless sneaks get in, cause it multiplies them on a crit. It takes some practice to make it work right (for example it doesn't stack WF and EWF so you have to add a +1 to the weapon bonus to hit; also you have to write your lvl 20 BAB then add +10 to the weapon bonus to hit for a lvl 40 build and some other tricks).<br><br>Anyhow, to make it short, I compared single wielding a scimitar to dual wielding shortswords. Dual wielding shortswords gives a higher damage output till AC 64 where it evens out; the difference is more noticeable vs FEs and with a +5 weapon. Against non FEs and with mundane weapons the scimitar gets slightly better at the highest AC (really slightly). Against Fes with +5 weapons shortsword are basically always better.<br><br>Decreasing STR to 30 reduces the range in which shortswords are the best choice by something like 10-12 AC vs FEs. With mundane weapons vs non FEs scimitar gets definitely the best choice already starting at an AC of 48-52.<br><br>Even with STR gear a bare +2 STR difference drastically changes the effectives of dual shortswords vs scimitar.<br><br>Summing up: dual wielding is overall the best choice if you keep the same STR. It is especially true vs FEs and with +5 weapons. PM AC and crit immunity will cover the AC loss from having to use light armor. DEX gear will bring the AC closer to that with single wielding in full plate (up to -4 AC to be exact, with +8 DEX, not too difficult it's Cat's Grace and a +5 DEX item) but you'll also have the definite possibility to put points into Hide/MS and go for some sneaking.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Unto to the darkness<br>I commend my soul<br>Never shall I repent<br>Never shall I be saved<br><br>I'll go into the House of Death<br>Before my last breath<br>My enemies all shall die!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 09/01/06 20:00</span></i></p>

Darn nice work.  This is the kinda thing I was trying to come up with meself.  You beat me to it.
