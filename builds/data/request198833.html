Working on a Build for a friend in our group who wishes to play a Healer but one that is difficult to hit.  I thought a Cleric/Monk/CoT would be a No-Brainer, but was wondering if something like this were a viable alternative.  I've looked around and didn't see anything like this, so wanted to check in here with you all.  I've got several issues, as you'll discover when you read below.  Haven't determined final Saves or Skills yet.<br><br>Cleric17/CoT10/SD13<br>Phantom Prelate<br>Race: Human<br><br>Str10<br>Int14<br>Wis16(20)<br>Dex16(32)<br>Con10<br>Chr8<br><br>1Cleric, Dodge, Mobility, Domain: Trickery and Healing<br>2Cleric<br>3Cleric, Weapon Finesse<br>4Cleric, Dex 17<br>5Cleric<br>6Cleric, Maximize Spell<br>7Cleric<br>8Cleric, Dex18<br>9Cleric, Weapon Focus: Light Hammer<br>10Cleric<br>11Cleric<br>12Cleric, Dex19, Expertise<br>13Cleric<br>14Cleric<br>15Cleric, Quicken (Combat Casting?)<br>16CoT, Dex20<br>17Shadowdancer<br>18Shadowdancer, Improved Expertise<br>19Shadowdancer<br>20Shadowdancer,Dex 21<br>21CoT, Great Wisdom I, Great Dex I<br>22SD<br>23SD<br>24SD, Great Dex II, Dex24<br>25SD<br>26SD<br>27SD, Great Dex III<br>28SD, Dex26<br>29SD<br>30CoT, Great Dex IV<br>31CoT, Great Wis II<br>32CoT, Dex28<br>33CoT, Armor Skin, Great Wis III<br>34CoT<br>35Cleric<br>36CoT, Great Dex V, Great Wis IV, Dex 30<br>37CoT<br>38CoT, Improved Combat Casting (auto-quicken?)<br>39Shadowdancer, Epic Dodge, Great Dex VI<br>40Cleric, Dex 32<br><br>AB: 37<br>Naked AC w/Shield=36<br>Hit Points: 340 Max<br>Spells<br><br>7...1st: Cure Light Wounds<br>7...2nd: Cure Moderate Wounds, Invisibility<br>7...3rd: Cure Serious Wounds, Invisibility Sphere<br>7..4th: Cure Critical Wounds<br>6...5th: Healing Circle, Raise Dead, Improved Invis<br>5...6th: Heal, Restoration<br>4...7th: Resurrection<br>3...8th: Mass Heal<br>2...9th: Summon Creature IX<br><br>The point of this build is not AB or high attack routine.  It is not a solo character, but is designed for Party play of 4 or more. It was to make a creature that was slippery, hard to hit, and be able to slip into any battle his party is engaged in and keep everyone healed and buffed.  Casting his Maximized and Empowered Healing spells, he should be able to keep everybody alive, and with his Epic Dodge, High AC, his Trickery Domain and Hide in Plain Sight, he will be a difficult opponent to target.  By no means is he designed for offense, but he still maintains a decent AB and can quickly Buff himself if necessary.<br><br>My problem is, with all the defensive capabilities provided by Shadowdancer, are the Combat Casting Feats going to make a difference?  If they do, would it be any better than Quicken Feats?  Or would it be wiser to drop both lines of thought and, instead, stop with a 30 Dex, and instead take Great Wisdom V, raise it one more at 40 to 22 for an extra 6th level spell slot, and then still have another feats that I could sink into a meta magic spell?<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
