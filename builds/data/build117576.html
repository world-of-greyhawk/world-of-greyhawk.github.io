I don't know if anyone's posted this already, since I'm not about to read through this entire thread.<br><br>A pretty good build for PvE, especially on a high magic server, that I've had some great success with:<br><br>Human<br>29 Monk<br>1 Sorc<br>10 RDD<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>Str: 14<br>Dex: 16<br>Con: 14<br>Int: 10<br>Wis: 14<br>Cha: 8<br><br>First 20 levels: Monk (Just to ensure you get cool glowy eyes if you are the right sex =D) Then 1 level sorc, 10 levels of RDD, and then your final 9 levels of Monk.<br><br>Focus skill points into Tumble and Discipline. Personally because I like not requiring a rogue wherever I go I tend to put 10 points or so into Lockpick and making good use of my dex bonus, I also try to keep my Lore maxxed until it is about 30. Ensure you have enough skill points to take RDD by the time you get it.<br><br>With the Monk's natural immunities and innate spell resistance, combined with a Monk's innate abilities to get a high AC, combined with the stat and AC bonuses from RDD, with the Armor skin Epic Feat, 2 levels of Epic Toughness, and 2 levels of Epic Spell Resistance, you become neigh on impervious to most attacks with the right high level gear.<br><br>His major downfall for PvE and PvP is a lack of AB. While nothing can really hit him, he can have a tough time hitting high level creatures. I find it amusing, that on the server I created him for, his AC is so high that he wouldn't be able to hit himself except for a natural 20.<br><br>He is also weak if caught "flat footed", as he looses his massive dex ac.<br><br>Lastly, Dev Crit, I imagine, would be end game for him (if you're on a server w/o immunity: Crit items) as his fort save isn't that high. Its only a matter of time till that melee rolls a natural 20 against him.<br><br>Aidon<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 10/12/07 19:23</span></i></p>

I was fooling around with a similar build and thats why I did a search and found this one. One thing you might want to do is juggle you ability scores around to allow for 1rst level spells and thus open up true strike; that combined with imp kd would make easier work of some of the oppponents you previously could not hit. Not bad though. <br><br>ps - mine was a STR build ! Very interesting to say the least.

Yes, this can be very effective, but as MT says, nicely: (1) if it's RDD it's a STRENGTH build, and (2) a sorceror who can't cast is . . . not living up to potential, let's say.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Ithacan

Old build, check the date, you can notice it doesn't even fulfills the Build Template, big lack of information, and who knows if you'll get a response from the author.
