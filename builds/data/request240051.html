Alright....<br><br>...I will not even pretend that I am *somewhat* skilled in character building. This stuff just doesn't click for me, though I do have my moments when something goes right and works pretty good. So, I'm going to ask you guys for some tips, advice, maybe some pointers in the right direction.<br><br><br>Currently, I play on a RP server (although this isn't a problem, as I can think up a reasonable story for any combo)that supports up to level 30. I have seen haste items occassionaly in the rare goods store, though I have yet to acquire one since I'm still level 6 and broke.<br><br>I'm looking for something that is a cleric...prehaps with some Weapon Master thrown in. Doesn't have to have the *highest* AB possible, but it should be contendable. The DC on the spells doesn't need to be outlandishly high, but I do like to use them to complement the fight (i.e. using Harm to set them up for a quick win...Implode or destruction to just drop them...etc....). I'd prefer it to be a strength based Human, using a Scimitar (Scimy's are beastly! ). I'm thinking about throwing in Monk for the speed and IKD, so....<br><br><br>..anyone got any opinions on a 17 cleric/ 7 Weapon Master/ 6 Monk? (keep in mind that I'd like contendable AB, and contendable AC wouldn't hurt)

Well, you want a Clerc/WM, I'd suggest Fighter for the third class, you feats will thank that, seriously, you need too much feat investment to go with a WM, so Fighter is great, you will also get W and EWS of course.<br><br>Scimitar? hah, you don't know the real power of a scythe! a scythe WM can multiply all your Cleric buf damage X5, check this build, one of my favorites <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "174667", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Hannibal</a> by Firestar (I really need to make one of those for me).<br><br>Oh well, being a Cleric, and level 30 based, 7 WM might be enough for you, Cleric 17 / WM 7 / Fghter 6 could be a good idea.<br><br>No time to make you a build now... but check that link for an idea on big damage, good AB too...

With only 30 levels, multiclassing a Cleric can be tough. You'll probably want 16 levels for the level 8 casting, that leaves 14 for other stuff.  One possibility would be a Bard 4/Cleric 16/RDD 10.  You would only have 3 attacks per round, but the RDD bonuses will give you an AB equal to or better than the WM build (you'll get some AC boosts too) and divine power would give you a 4th attack at your max AB.  I wouldn't consider monk unless I was going dex based, you'll lose your bonuses if you use a shield and armor, which you'll want to carry if you're strength based.<br><br>As was noted by Thaxll'ssyllia, If you want to go WM you should probably take fighter levels so that you don't use all your feats meeting the WM prereqs.  Cleric 17/WM 7/Fighter 6, should be okay.  Cleric 20/Fighter 4/CoT 6 would also do well, a bit weaker melee-wise but a stronger caster.<br><br>If you really want a good AC Bard 4/Cleric 16/PM 10 will be your best bet (immunity to crits is nice too).<br><br>If you want to go ranged Arcane Archer 13/Sorc 1/Cleric 16 would work well.  Use zen archery for your AB boost and you should be fine.<br><br>If any of these builds interest you, let me know and I'll work something out.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 05/09/06 22:28</span></i></p>

Probably going to go with the Cleric 17/WM 7/Fighter 6...<br><br>...see, I figure the 17 levels of cleric will get me the 9th level spells, and the 7 weapon master will get the Ki Critical, and of course the 6 fighter for feats (and some AB I geuss...)...

Hmm, I have seen a few of these builds...nice stuff for melee!<br><br>I think you want to take Fighter Levels begining at 16 until 22? Then you get a fourth attack and room for the feats, epic and pre-epic.<br><br>So maybe 16 Cleric...6 Fighter...Return to Cleric for 1 more level...then 7 WM levels.<br><br>That would give you 4 attacks, enough feats, the WM abilities, 9th level spells (etc.)<br><br>It may be rough playability and the PvP won't be great until level 30 because that is when you would get the best of the best weapon master abilities.<br><br>So is playability an option?

Playability is not a factor as I am surprisingly tolerant when it comes to playing crap s chars if I know that it'll be my dog day so to speak when it reaches 40 ( or 30 in this case).

Good build, very good AB unbuffed and naked... with buffs it would shoot up even higher.<br><br>Problem is the HP. Why not start with less strength and just leave it and use Divine Power which brings it to 18 automatically.

Subraces boni to stats might not qualify you for spell lvls (or for feats prerequisites, for the matter) since usually your modified score is not considered a base stat. If you get a green WIS, remember you need a 19 base WIS  (without the subrace modifier) to be able to cast 9th lvl spells.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free
