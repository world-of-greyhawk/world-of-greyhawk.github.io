Not really a Damage based build, so may not apply.  A cleric/arcane archer build can easily get up there.  With a good bow and arrows you can do about 50 dmg per hit, so not too bad on dmg either.  I think the build that I tried was something like 11cleric/2bard/27AA.  After buffs it was quite a good ab.  I tried this build with zen archery, but I think that was the wrong approach due to AC limitations.

I have been trying to maximize the AB of my melee character. And once my charactersheet told me I had +87 with my Fighter(15) / WeaponMaster(10) / Cleric(15), fully buffed. But after several tries I noticed the rolls. The AB was only +70. The character sheet will lie to you! <br>Weapon enhancement and all the buffs hit the ab bonus cap of +20 very soon.<br><br>So I tried the Half-Orc Fighter (11)/Weapon Master(28)/Rogue(1). A AB of +60 with a mundane weapon of choice. Find a way to get +20 to attack, and you'll have +80.<br><br>An AA with optimization for AB can reach +89 I think.

In response to the low AC with the Cleric build, you may want to consider sling rather than bow.  The reasoning behind this is that although you lose a little base damage on the weapon, you get to wear a shield to help make up for it.  Zen archery is really great for Cleric builds since it allows you to get a very good AB as well as DC.  You don't really lose all that much damage, since base damage is usually relatively insignificant compared to the damage bonuses you get from spells and AA lvls.

With decent gear, my first Holy Archer build iteration had an AB in the 90's and an AC in the 50's.  That's according to the character sheet, and with a casting of True Strike.

Is there a AA build similiar to this posted that shows the leveling progression or did I miss it?
