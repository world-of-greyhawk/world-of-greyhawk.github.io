I have this character idea stuck in my head that I need some help with. I really like the idea of playing a Drow who follows the path of Eilistraee and leaves the Underdark. The kicker is he has a benevolent pet giant spider who leaves with him. As silly as it may be I don't think I can play this character if the spider needs to be a bear or a panther or anything else really. The spider stays.<br><br>So my dilema is that the giant spider pet seems way to fragile to be an integral part of game play. I hope I'm wrong here, this is just my guess. I was hoping someone could tell me if the Giant Spider Pet is playable or not.<br><br>If the only way he will work is if I take 40 levels of Ranger then so be it. I guess that goes for Druid as well, but I was really seeing this character as more of a Ranger. Anyway that part is open for negotiation, the spider ain't <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Also if anyone knows of a way to make the spider playable by using an unorthodox build I'm all ears. In fact I think I'd prefer it as it doesn't seem to me that a straight 1-40 Ranger, or druid for that matter, looks to be a particularly powerful build.<br><br>I'm open to suggestions. Please help my spider. I don't want to send Snarg to the spider pound <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Chumgeyser on 11/22/06 06:50</span></i></p>

hehe ^^^^<br><br>Well, your problem is two-fold: 1) Spiders are weak (as you know) and 2) Rangers don't have great buffing spells (other than Cat's grace and Greater Magic Fang).<br><br>My only advice to you, is make a Druid instead. Keep multi-classing to a minimum to keep you spider levels up.  I would also take the Empower Spell, both for direct damage spells as well as Empowered Bulls Strength (for you and the spider).<br><br>The druid buffs you can give your spider:<br><br>- Bulls Strength (empowered for +3 to +7 Str boost)<br>- Barkskin (max 5 AC @ level 13)<br>- Greater Magic Fang (+5 to hit, +5 damage @ level 15)<br>- Awaken (+4 Con, +4 Strength, +2 attack)<br>- Stoneskin (DR 10/+5, max 100 points of damage)<br>- Aura of Vitality (+4 Con, +4 Dex, +4 Str)<br><br>(Note: I have not tested as to whether the Animal Companion is affected by Awaken or Aura of Vitality. It seems that I might remember some bug or something so that they didn't. But it's been a while so I may very well be mistaken.  You should check your combat logs to be sure.)<br><br>But, a spider is still going to be weaker, so you will have to babysit it a bit. Let a Summoned creature go in first then let your spider join the fray. <br><br>Cheers.

Did he have a spider pet also? I know of the character but not much. I was afraid I might be cutting it too close to him. Anyway I still think it's a cool idea, even if not original.<br><br>That being said I kinda gave up on the Ranger idea and started to think along the lines of what you suggested Dmuzzy. Then I gave up on that as well. I just can't get into playing a druid. So back to the drawing board. I'll try not to copy Frizzil Dizzil Schinizzil for my next character idea. Hmm maybe I'll make a rapping drow rogue that adds izzil to the end of everything he says? I think I'll call him Scoop Dawg <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Chumgeyser on 11/22/06 23:29</span></i></p>

I like that idea too Dark. Something about a pet spider is appealing <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

My advice is:<br>Make a strong character with ranger or druid in it for the animal companion. Both assassin/blackguard with the use poison feat and druid with venom immunity and poison spells fit the spider theme.<br>Choose a Spider companion <i>for role playing purposes</i> and spawn a second spider from a summon IV spell.<br>They are there to look cool, and your character takes care of the fighting part.<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan
