Hi everyone, this is my first post since becoming a member and everyone here seems quite well versed in the finer points of character construction so, I am building a dex based dwarf monk for the PW I play on and have questions as to how to maximize his powers.<br>First of all, I plan to take lvs 1-14 as monk.<br>At 15-20 I will take fighter lvs for the extra attack each round. At lv 21 (if I've figured this right) he will have 6 atks/round at +25 ab.<br>The following 9 lvs I will put into monk as well for the save and SR bonuses.<br>I was going to add the last 10 lvs as Dwarven Defender, here's why: 10 lvs of DD gives you d12 HD for an exta 120 Hps (ignoring Con bonus) plus 6 points of damage redux and the Defensive Stance which is supposed to allow a character to "retain their dex bonus to Ac even when caught flat-footed." Being able to retain dex bonus to Ac sounds like a very good idea for a dex based monk.<br><br>Will this build work? Any major weaknesses that you can see? How important is Wis for a monk, anyway?<br>This is my first monk so I need feed back on this one, please.<br>Thanks.<br>M_Prometheus

At level 20 your build will have a 16 BAB, I don't see where you got +25 from, unless you are uncluding your dex, which you didn't post.

Oops, you're right I included dex bonus to atk.

I realized that adding Fig lvs is kinda useless if I deceide to go with DD lvs anyway so instead I'm taking my first 5 DD lvs at 14. This still gives me the 6th atk by lv 21 but gives the Defensive Stance ability and d12 hit die much earlier.
