<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>This is a monk variant of the Hidden Death rogue/fighter build I posted recently.  Like Hidden Death, it's an elven rogue (yay keen senses) with no XP penalties, and it gets Hide in Plain Sight, Epic Dodge, and Self Concealment V.  I like the combination of monk and rogue for a number of reasons:<br><br>1) The monk's unarmed damage of 1d20 helps against crit/sneak immune enemies, as does the fact that it's a blunt weapon<br><br>2) The monk gets a number of combat feats for free that are very useful to a rogue, such as Improved Knockdown and Stunning Fist, as well as the monk's extra speed and AC.  It also gives the build Improved Evasion for free, opening up a rogue bonus feat to be used for something else.<br><br>3) Two of the rogue class's weaknesses are its fortitude and will saving throws.  Monk levels help raise all saving throws, as well as making fortitude and will somewhat less important by granting immunity to most poisons and diseases as well as mind-affecting spells.<br><br><br>Elf, any lawful alignment<br>STR 10<br>DEX 20 (32)<br>CON 12<br>WIS 10<br>INT 12<br>CHA 8<br><br>1: Rogue(1) - Dodge<br>2: Monk(1)<br>3: Rogue(2) - Weapon Finesse<br>4: Monk(2)<br>5: Rogue(3)<br>6: Monk(3) - Weapon Focus (unarmed)<br>7: Monk(4)<br>8: Rogue(4)<br>9: Rogue(5) - Toughness<br>10: Monk(5)<br>11: Monk(6)<br>12: Rogue(6) - Improved Critical (unarmed)<br>13: Rogue(7)<br>14: Monk(7)<br>15: Monk(8) - Blind Fight<br>16: Rogue(8)<br>17: Monk(9)<br>18: Rogue(9) - Mobility<br>19: Rogue(10) - Defensive Roll<br>20: Monk(10)<br>21: Shadowdancer(1) - Epic Weapon Focus (unarmed)<br>22: Rogue(11)<br>23: Monk(11)<br>24: Monk(12) - Great Dex I<br>25: Rogue(12)<br>26: Monk(13)<br>27: Rogue(13) - Epic Dodge, Great Dex II<br>28: Monk(14)<br>29: Rogue(14)<br>30: Rogue(15) - Epic Prowess<br>31: Monk(15)<br>32: Monk(16)<br>33: Rogue(16) - Self Concealment I, II<br>34: Rogue(17)<br>35: Monk(17)<br>36: Monk(18) - Self Concealment III<br>37: Rogue(18)<br>38: Rogue(19) - Self Concealment IV<br>39: Monk(19) - Self Concealment V<br>40: Monk(20)<br><br>Skills (305 total points)<br>Hide 43<br>Move Silently 43<br>Tumble 40<br>Discipline 43<br>UMD 41<br>Disable Trap 25<br>Open Lock 20<br>Search 20<br>Spot 30<br><br>Naked AC - 33 (+1 against current/last target)<br><br>Naked AB - 39/36/33/30/27 (37/34/31/28/25/37 with Flurry of Blows)<br><br>Naked Damage - 1d20 + 10d6 sneak attack<br><br>Max HP - 362<br><br>Saving Throws:<br>Fortitude - 21<br>Reflex - 35<br>Will - 20<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 06/06/05 20:47</span></i></p>

If you change the pre epic leveling to have one class at 12 and the other at 8 instead of a 10/10 you can net yourself some easy attack bonus.

If I had seen this, I probably wouldn't have bothered to post the Planar Scout.  It's a good build.  The Planar Scout counts as a variant of this, I'd say.  But with an experience penalty late in the game.  <br><br>Nice work.<br>_________________<br>We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender - Winston Churchill

Question from an inexperienced builder <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br>I've noticed that even on more monk heavy builds that use unarmed over kamas, improved ki strike is rarely if ever taken.  Is the feat really not worth the stat split?  As I thought guantlets only allowed for attack and not enhancement bonuses(though I could be very much off on this one) wouldn't this limit the monk to only enemies with a dr of 3/- or lower?  Thanks.<br><br>Azclown

Attack bonus counts for punching DR.  Monk gloves make ki strike useless.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
