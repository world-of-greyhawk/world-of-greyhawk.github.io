I have always hesitated to play a true arcane caster build. But now I have decided to give it a try.  <br>I'm trying to start a new line of House Duskryn on Fredian, but until recently, only 4 members have appeared. None of them is a Arcane Spellcaster. I decided to build a Drow sorcerer, so this will be the newest addition to the Fredian line of House Duskryn.<br>The duskryns on the Island of Fredian have forsaken Lolth in favor of Vhaeraun. It has not yet come to open war with the Lolth clergy and houses, but hopefully, Duskryn will be ready by the time it starts. With Lomion, hopefully the Arcane will be a weak spot no longer.<br>When the Fredian Line of the House is complete, the disciples and blackguards of Vhaeraun will step forward to further His goals; <br><br><i>Vhaeraun is the god of thievery and the<br>furthering of drow aims, interests, and<br>power on the surface world. He is also the<br>god of drow males opposed to the matriarchy<br>of Lolth, teaching that females are no<br>better than males. He believes that drow<br>should work with other elven races for<br>common advancement; never associating<br>or trading with duergar, svirfneblin,<br>or other dwarven and gnomish races.<br>(Humans and halflings can be tolerated.)<br>Vhaeraun is handsome, even vain, and<br>does not forget slights and deceptions.</i><br><br><br>Name: Lomion Duskryn<br>Race: Drow<br>Class: Sorcerer (37) / Blackguard (2) / Rogue (1)<br>Alignment: Chaotic Evil<br>Familiar: Eyeball; Name: Purify<br><br>Stats:<br>STR	14<br>DEX	10<br>CON	12<br>INT	14<br>WIS	10<br>CHA	16 (26)<br><br>Raise CHA every Attribute increase.<br><br>1	Sorcerer	Combat Casting<br>2	Sorcerer	<br>3	Sorcerer	Spell Penetration<br>4	Sorcerer	<br>5	Sorcerer	<br>6	Sorcerer	Greater Spell Penetration<br>7	Sorcerer	<br>8	Sorcerer	<br>9	Sorcerer	Still Spell<br>10	Sorcerer	<br>11	Sorcerer	<br>12	Sorcerer	Empower Spell<br>13	Sorcerer	<br>14	Sorcerer	<br>15	Sorcerer	Expertise<br>16	Sorcerer	<br>17	Sorcerer	<br>18	Sorcerer	Improved Expertise<br>19	Sorcerer	<br>20	Sorcerer	<br>21	Sorcerer	Epic Spell Penetration<br>22	Sorcerer	<br>23	Sorcerer	s* Epic Spell: Mage Armor<br>24	Sorcerer	Power Attack<br>25	Sorcerer	<br>26	Sorcerer	s* Automatic Still Spell I<br>27	Sorcerer	Cleave<br>28	Sorcerer	<br>29	Sorcerer	s* Automatic Still Spell II<br>30	Sorcerer	Automatic Still Spell III<br>31	Blackguard	<br>32	Sorcerer	<br>33	Sorcerer	Epic Spell: Epic Warding; s* Improved Combat Casting<br>34	Sorcerer	<br>35	Sorcerer	<br>36	Sorcerer	Epic Spells: Dragon Knight, s* Hellball<br>37	Sorcerer	<br>38	Blackguard	<br>39	Sorcerer	Maximize Spell<br>40	Bard	<br><br>S* = Epic Sorcerer bonus spell.<br><br>Skills:<br>Put points into Spellcraft(40) and Concentration(at least 25, for improved Combat casting.

Is there another reason besides maxing tumble that you took rogue/bard (you flip flop between them in your post) levels?

It is supposed to say Bard all over. Where blackguard is relevant for RP issues, the Bard level isn't. That's purely a OOC addition to the build. Indeed, to max out tumble and UMD.

I'd lose 1 sorc lvl and put 1 more for BG to max out ac with divine shield. Maybe lose some spells like epic dragon knight / epic mage armor, if going pvm mainly hellball gets pretty useless.

Pretty cool build. I'm mostly posting to comment on the RP stuff in relation to the PW I play on, Sojourney Menzoberranzan, where Duskryn is the 9th house in the city. I'm sorry to say that your character would be executed for heresy on that server if found to be a follower of "Big V" as I like to call him, because I always forget how to spell the name. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Menzo is a strict Lolthite society, and anything else is heresy, at least in the War of the Spider Queen story we're playing. Certainly a heretic would never make it into the Duskryn nobility, as your character would be based on his name, Duskryn rather than Del'Duskryn.  Also Sorcerors are considered slow learners at the Academy as they learn fewer spells than Wizards. They are also not completely trusted due to the spontaneous nature of their magic, but that's Drow for you. On the plus side, leveling is really slow there and all of the players there would probably be flattened by this character. The highest we have is 14, I think. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Drow top out at 18 though, because of some subrace engine thing I don't really remember. I'm not trying to be critical or anything, your setting must be different than mine. Just posting my thoughts as the player of a devout Priestess of Lolth. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>So as not to be a total waste of time, I will comment on the build to the best of my ability. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Expertise would be handy as casters lose nothing while casting with it, but some servers do not allow casting with it on. Not sure if you knew that. If yours does, I say keep it even though if it was my server I would turn it off. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Since you asked, I can give my two cents about spells, though it would be helpful to know how much magic is available on your PW and what enemy types you commonly see, undead or outsiders for instance. At level 3 I would for sure get Fireball and/or Scintillating Sphere. At level 9, I would go with Time Stop, Mordenkainen's Disjunction, and Greater Spell Mantle. Take Premonition, but only if they don't hand out +5 weapons like candy. Cone of Cold is pretty nifty, as is Elemental Shield.

Saves? DCs? Actual AC? Skills?<br><br>If you're going to bump up your AC a lot you might want to go for Divine Shield. Assuming that you're only using Epic Mage Armor for the dodge bonus, that could free up another epic feat, since Divine Shield will give you as much dodge as you need.<br><br>And why's your charisma so low? Where's Spell Focus? I'd free up some room for those from Spell Penetration.

Again, old build.
