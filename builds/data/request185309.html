I am not sure how this build will work as building is new to me.  On a monk sorc RDD.  What would good feats be and which character would you focus on most.  How does a sorc 17/RDD 10/Monk13.  Would this give me a strong sorceror character.  I know that these builds will focus on charisma and wisdom.  Would the RDD +8 str at 10 give me what I need.  Any feedback would be helpful.<br><br>Thaylander Fleit<br>When in doubt punt

Depends on your intent, and why you're going with those classes.  The main problem I see, is you will have split attributes.  So; your Monk feeds off wisdom but your sorcerer feeds off Cha.<br>As a caster, I'd avoid it.  You won't have decent spell slots; or lvl9 spells; also you have a stronger melee build than caster<br><br>As a melee... well, it might work out but you may be better served with something like Sorc18/rdd10/monk12 - this will give one lvl9 spell and you can still get a few max'd IGMS at the end if you take maximize spell feat and IGMS spell (take all rdd and at least 4 monk levels before epic for best results, I think - this means starting as monk; taking sorcerer at char lvl3 + 4).  To be honest, imho; sorcerer is not the best melee caster build due to the minimal feats (and even then, Pally seems better served due to dual CHA benefit) and locked spells BUT it can work, if you plan it tightly.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 03/14/05 09:42</span></i></p>
