I had already made a version of this with fighter classes instead of rogue ones when I saw Dragon Kin on the epic character builds. I realised straight away that it was better than my original one so I made my rogue build. When it sneaks attacks (without flurry of blows on)it gets two attacks and can dal out over 190 damadge in a round (without buffs).<br><br>1. Rogue, lightning reflexes<br>2. Evasion<br>3. Sneak attack 2d6, uncanny dodge, dodge<br>4. Wisdom +1<br>5. Sneak attack 3d6<br>6. Uncanny dodge II, expertise<br>7. Sneak attack 4d6<br>8. Wisdom +1<br>9. Mobility<br>10.

I would also suggest tumble, perhaps.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 05/22/05 15:00</span></i></p>

take monk at lvl 21<br>and make your pre epic guy druid 12/rogue 8 or thw opposite<br>also.. you might want to go  12 druid 8 assasin and forget about rogue... yourll get more feats that way<br>but less skill point, but i think that its ok for this build.. with your str.. you wont be able to do much<br><br>aslo, put the last point into str.. youl need it.. your guy will DIE from the heavy loads he might have to bear while unshifted<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By aluka on 05/22/05 08:23</span></i></p>

oh, and just noticed.. if your going for a dragon, then you really should have IKD, because of the dragoin size, its much miore effective that way. and your sneak damage will be dealt while they are knocked down..<br><br>also.. why do you have mobility? spring attack? and whirlwind??? makes no sense to me now, could you please explain.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By aluka on 05/22/05 08:39</span></i></p>
