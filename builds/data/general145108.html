When you say melee pvp, would any sort of combination fighter/caster count?  Because I have a couple melee bards who through use of skills and low level spells gain a tremendous advantage over a straight "click on their unit and wait till someone kills the other" build.<br><br>Things like curse song, bard song, taunt, grease, darkness, even epic warding would chew this character apart in a pvp battle.

Another key factor is are any feats banned from the pvpserver you are playing on? I know a few ban dev crit. Are there more evil or good characters on your server? Are there a lot of smite characters? Are there any immunity items to prevent certain spells or other abilities? Are you on a high or low magic world? Without knowing these specifics, I'd say just use a straight up monk.

Lock plays on the same sevrer as me or at least the build he posted above was designed for that server i do not know if he still plays there but....on that server dev crit is enabled, ts does not reveal hidden players only invis ones and shadow dancers are disabled.  The max ab you can get on a weapon is +4 and max ac on an item is +8 I believe.  Further more divine power line of spells do not stack normally they are at reduced effectivness when stacked.  I also need to mention that kama do not exist on the server.  In general your character is considered inferior if he cannot achieve 55+ ab with gear and 65+ ac with gear if you want to melee anyway.  <br><br>Right now the server is clogged with people who abuse a little known sneak bug that is hard coded into the engine and that is for six seconds after you stealth(as long as you are out of site) you are undetectable regardless of spot and listen.  Many player combine this with dev crit and basicly repeatedly hit and run.<br><br> hi level Pure melee duels usually boil down to hitting a knockdown on a natural 20.  Oh and there are no immunity items at all.
