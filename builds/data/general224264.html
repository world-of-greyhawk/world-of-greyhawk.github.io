Hey everyone! I play on a high magic (we're talking +20 stuff here) world where Fighter/WM/Rogues are you absolute best possible choice to go. Without the WM AB it can get pretty difficult. The thing is I am tired of my Ftr/WM/Rge and i want soemthing different. <br><br>I am looking for a character that i can play to an evil RP, something that can pickpocket, hide, stealth, ALL the evil "rogue" stuf except the traps and locks. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"> <br><br>I would play a Rogue build but i am wanting to be able to kill people on the server (some people just have big mouths and need dealing with) the only probelm is rogues rely on their sneaks to do damage but almost every character has crit immubity. <br><br>Can anyone think of a character i can play to an evil RP that has all the rogue type things like Pickpocket and stealth but not rely on the sneaks? <br><br>and the more AB the character has the better <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>thanks in advance!<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.helpwinmybet.com/" target="_blank">http://www.helpwinmybet.com/</a>

Try a bard/AA build.  Rogue is optional since bard gets stealth and pick pocket as class skills.  Though you might be starved for skill points without rogue levels for the huge skillpoint gains.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

For melee a damaging stealth guy with high AB, Ranger springs to mind...Bane would be nice for extra damage and ab, dual wielding for free, a few spells to boost stats and hide/ms, the coolness of being Ranger <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> , though you'd have somewhat cacky ac due to the armor restrictions for dual wielding unless you went dex and loose a lot of damage...on a high magic world you could probably get around that though. Something like Ranger 21/WM 16/SD 3 would be nifty and a bit different, though feat starved.  The other more obvious route I guess would be just to go fighter/wm/sd though.

You can continue to make your Fighter/WM/Rogues, but switch it to a non-sneaker.  Make him have TONS of STR and WM levels for HIGH AB and DMG.  Only use Rogue levels for UMD and tumble.<br><br>Though, assassin comes to mind also.<br>-pc
