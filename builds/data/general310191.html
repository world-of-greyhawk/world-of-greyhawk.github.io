OKie... so if I take a specialized wizard and I cannot use conjuration spells because it's a prohibited class, does that mean I can't use wands or scrolls or potions that use conjuration spells?  I've been reading some of the posts for character builds and they seem to forget the fact that when your prohibited school is conjuration, you can't use those spells or items anymore.<br><br>For example, conjuration is healing... no healing potions can be used if your prohibited school is conjuration.<br><br>Is it just me and the server I play on, or is that indeed the fact universally?<br><br>I mention this here because I'd rather not post in response to builds I've been looking over in the sticky section that are over 4 years old.

good question!  I wish i could remember the correct answer, but its been a LOONG time since i played a wizard, and the only one i truly embraced was under PRC rules and was a red wizard of thay, which had NASTY prohibited classES.<br><br>I seem to remember though, that IF you take the wrong specialization you cannot use Healing of ANY kind, which includes potions.  Again, i am going back about 5 years, and i seem to remember a guy whining in a game one time that he couldnt heal but by resting.  I do know that my wiz couldnt cast a necessity like True sight, even from an item.  <br><br>Hope that helps alittle.

You should be able to use potions AFAIK, unless it's bugged.<br>_________________<br><i>Ghaash agh akûl - Nazgûl skoiz<br>Mirdautas vras!<br>Karn ghaamp agh nût<br>Shaut Manwe quiinubat gukh</i><br><br>Summoning - Mirdautas Vras

Maybe it's just in conjunction with red wizard of thay.  I know that when I choose conjuration as a prohibited school, I am no longer allowed to use healing potions of any kind.  I've never played a specialist wizard beyond RWoT so perhaps it's different for other casters.

Er, you seem to be confused.  Any wizard that "specializes" in a spell school is a specialist wizard, it has absolutely nothing to do with an extra class or something.  In other words, if you're not a generalist, you're a specialist.  Are you saying you've never played a non-generalist wizards without using this Wizard of Thay extra class thingy?
