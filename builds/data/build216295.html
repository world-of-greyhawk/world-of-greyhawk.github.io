The idea was to make an archer of the dwarves.  Nothing less.  Perhaps a little more.  But otherwise just an interesting idea.   Not terribly inspiring, but kinda fun to play a dwarf as an elf *hears many drunken shouts and jeers from a heavily bearded group in the corner* I know, I know, its just an <i>idea</i>...<br><br>Defending Archer<br>Dwarf<br>Lawful<br>Ranger 21, DD 18, SD 1<br><br><b>playable 1-40, PvM</b><br><br>STR 10<br>DEX 16 to 30<br>CON 16<br>WIS 14<br>INT 14<br>CHA 6<br><br><br>Skills:<br>Concentration 30 [33]<br>Craft Trap 23 [25]<br>Disable Trap 1(2cc) [3]<br>Discipline 30 [30]<br>Heal 4 [6]<br>Hide 30 [40]<br>Move Silently 40 [50]<br>Set Trap 20 [30]<br>Tumble 40 [50]<br><br><br>Spells:<br>1: Grease, Entangle<br>2: Cat's Grace, One with Land, Protec from Elem<br>3: Aid, Invis Purge<br>4: Freedom of Movement, Mass Camo<br><br><br>AC: 30 (min 31 with Cat's Grace) (+4 in Defensive Stance)<br>HP: 594 (674 in Defensive Stance) also has 12/- DR<br>Attack: 44/39/34/29  (min 45/40/35/30 with Cat's Grace)<br>Damage: 1d8 (19-20/x3) (+2 with Mighty bow and in Defensive Stance)<br><br><br>Saving Throws:<br>Fort: 27<br>Will: 22<br>Refl: 26<br>(+2 from Defensive Stance, +2 vs spells Dwarven Hardiness)<br><br><br>1 Ranger1 Point Blank Shot, FE: Undead<br>2 Ranger2<br>3 Ranger3 Dodge<br>4 Ranger4<br>5 Ranger5 FE: Dragons<br>6 Ranger6 Toughness<br>7 Ranger7<br>8 DD1<br>9 DD2 Weap Foc: Longbow<br>10 DD3<br>11 DD4<br>12 DD5 Impr Crit: Longbow<br>13 Ranger8<br>14 DD6<br>15 DD7 Rapid Shot<br>16 Ranger9<br>17 DD8<br>18 DD9 Mobility<br>19 DD10<br>20 Ranger10 FE: Constructs<br><br>21 DD11 Epic Weap Foc: Longbow<br>22 DD12<br>23 DD13<br>24 DD14 Great Dex I, Epic Prowess<br>25 Ranger11<br>26 Ranger12<br>27 Ranger13 Great Dex II<br>28 DD15<br>29 Ranger14<br>30 Ranger15 Blinding Speed, FE: Outsiders<br>31 Ranger16<br>32 DD16<br>33 Ranger17 Great Dex III<br>34 Ranger18<br>35 Ranger19<br>36 DD17 Great Dex IV<br>37 SD1<br>38 Ranger20 FE: Elementals<br>39 Ranger21 Bane of Enemies<br>40 DD18 Armor Skin<br><br><br>Basically this char uses the Animal Companion, traps, spells and suppressive arrow fire to help cull down the enemies before they reach the line of dwarven defenders in front.  Also the use of spells and HiPS allows for evasive movement and strategic attacks.  Also, Defensive Stance should work better for an archer, since you won't be moving around back and forth in melee.  All in all a fairly hardy archer.<br><br>Comments, suggestions and whatever else is welcome.  I was working on a story, but I am busy.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Many that live deserve death.

Hmmm, can you activate Def Stance when equipped with missile weapon? Even if you can't, this char is still viable.

Blinding speed is what I would let go as you say.<br>This guy is tight on feats, but rapid shot is better than blinding speed. You can afford a couple potions of speed in most settings. Or perhaps perma-haste. But you are right, tight feat schedule, so one will need to choose carefully.<br>And even if you can't Def stance while doing bows, its still a good defensive option when forced to melee.

I know it's changing the classes about, but you could use fighter instead of ranger. I realise you would have to start cross classing skills to get SD, but you take it so late anyway you would have time to CC, and you would get all those extra feats you need.  Additionally, you could take more SD levels, as well as drop the WIS back down to 10, get 14 str which would give you a little more melee presence.  I realise that it would change the whole concept, which you may not want. Fighter 11, DD 22, SD 7 .. something like that. DR would be 15/- for DD levels, you would gain Evasion, Uncanny Dodge (vital for a dex build), Shadow Evade/Daze, Defensive Roll &amp; Slippery Mind; as well as 5 for fighter feats. Called Shot, Finesse, WS (Bow &amp; Finesseable), EWS?

Well, OK, not immune. While engaged in combat he is immune, even to invisible attackers, but when he just stands there he can be sneak attacked. KD'ed he can probably be sneaked to. I think that if you suspect or KNOW an invisible enemy is about, you can enter defensive stance, I think he is "engaged" in combat then.<br>Not sure.
