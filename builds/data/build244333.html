This is just a different take on a stereotypical Ranger.  Didn't find one like it, so I thought I would submit it.  Some tweaking can be done, but in general I am pretty happy with the end result.<br>You get BoE almost immediately into epic, and the saves, AC and HPs are okay too.  I delayed CoT levels pretty much for that reason alone, although grabbing them all in epic does net some sorely needed feats.<br>Basically, when you begin, make use of Medium Armour, a good shield and Barbarian Rage in the tough situations.  Later on, you can sneak if you need to scout, but otherwise just lay traps and encourage enemies to follow you through them.  Pepper with arrows to taste, and finish with melee before serving. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br><b>Name: </b>Ranger Champion<br><b>Classes: </b>Ranger 30, Barbarian 2, Champion of Torm 8<br><b>Playable 1-40, PvM</b><br><b>Race: </b>Human<br><b>Alignment: </b>Anything not Evil<br><br><b>Stats: </b><br><br>Str 14 to 14<br>Dex 14 to 28<br>Con 14 to 16<br>Wis 14 to 14<br>Int 14 to 14<br>Cha 8 to 8<br><br><br><b>Leveling: </b><br><br>1 Ranger1 Luck of Heroes, Blind Fight, FE1<br>2 Barbarian1<br>3 Barbarian2 Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>4 Ranger2<br>5 Ranger3<br>6 Ranger4 Weapon Finesse<br>7 Ranger5 FE2<br>8 Ranger6<br>9 Ranger7 Improved Critical: Longbow<br>10 Ranger8<br>11 Ranger9<br>12 Ranger10 Weapon Focus: Shortsword, FE3<br>13 Ranger11<br>14 Ranger12<br>15 Ranger13 Improved Critical: Shortsword<br>16 Ranger14<br>17 Ranger15 FE4<br>18 Ranger16 Toughness<br>19 Ranger17<br>20 CoT1<br><br>21 Ranger18 Great Dex I<br>22 Ranger19<br>23 Ranger20 FE5<br>24 Ranger21 BoE<br>25 CoT2 EWF: Longbow<br>26 CoT3<br>27 CoT4 EWF: Shortsword, Great Dex II<br>28 CoT5<br>29 CoT6 Epic Prowess<br>30 CoT7 Great Con I<br>31 CoT8 Armor Skin<br>32 Ranger22<br>33 Ranger23 FE6, Great Con II<br>34 Ranger24<br>35 Ranger25 FE7<br>36 Ranger26 FE8, Great Dex III<br>37 Ranger27<br>38 Ranger28<br>39 Ranger29 FE9, Great Dex IV<br>40 Ranger30 FE10<br><br><br><br><br><b>Skills: </b>263<br>Discipline 43 [45]<br>Listen 43 [45]<br>Craft Trap 33 [35]<br>Set Trap 26 [35]<br>Animal Empathy 42 [41]<br>Hide 22 [31]<br>Move Silently 42 [51]<br>Disable Trap 1 (2 skillpoints used)<br>Heal 10 [12]<br><br><br><b>Spells: </b>Full Ranger list<br>1: Camo, Ultravision, Resist Elements<br>2: Cat's Grace, One With Land, Protection from Elements<br>3: Aid, Greater Magic Fang<br>4: Mass Camo, Cure Serious Wounds<br><br><br><b>HP: </b>564<br><br><br><b>AC: </b>21 naked, 24-25 buffed with a large shield<br><br><br><b>AB: </b>43/38/33/28, +2 versus FEs<br><br><br><b>Saves: </b><br><br>Fort 33<br>Reflex 29<br>Will 24<br>_________________<br>“If you bring a Ranger with you, it is well to pay attention to him...”<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By christian.schnabel on 06/18/06 21:42</span></i></p>

I'd swap it around to focus on getting the melee feats first (finesse and shortsword focus) then longbow focus, then improved criticals or other combat feats (since you're part archer, working in called shot might be good).<br><br>You can get to dex 30 as I'm sure you know, but the extra points in con certainly don't hurt either and it's not like your AB is poor.  Your AC might benefit though, since you won't benefit from wearing any armor besides a shield in this build.<br><br>Most of your damage will come from bane, but that's fine as far as I'm concerned, you get enough FEs to make it work nicely.<br><br>Good use of barbarian levels for uncanny dodge.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

I like it. However, IMO, you should have PBS and RS to fully utilize a bow. This is why I suggest you get 4 levels of CoT pre-epic. You can pick the aforementioned feats and you get a boost to saves aswell. You're losing two epic feats, that's true; you can either drop DEX (oh yes, that or CON) by two points to fix this, <b>or</b> you might want to drop two FEs. I think the feats would be beneficial whichever route you went, though each to his own.<br><br>Again, I like the build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>And the obvious: at the cost of saves and XP penalty one might opt to use Ftr instead of CoT in order to get more damage from EWS.<br>_________________<br>"We keep our Feast of Feasts, sure of our bourne,<br>                 Our aims self-same:<br>The Guest of Guests, friend <i>Zarathustra</i>, came!<br>The world now laughs, the grisly veil was torn,<br>And Light and Dark were one that wedding-morn."<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 06/18/06 23:38</span></i></p>

As always more ranger levels = better ranger. Interesting take on a Dex-based, I haven't seen enough of those.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

As a ranger you get cat's grace, which will increase your dex by at least 2 points - so you'll always have a higher AC without armor than with unless you can get like, padded +8 or something.  Your normal dex bonus uses up the armor's allowed dex bonus so anything you buff on to it using equipment and cat's grace is going to be "wasted" if you aren't wearing cloth.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

I know you may wish to get uncanny dodge (barb 2) as early as possible, however; <br><br>taking 1 extra ranger level pre-epic (picking up the barb level later) will give you an extra 1 to Reflex &amp; Will saving throws...for free !
