I've played this excellent rpg lately, namely the Witcher. I haven't read the book yet (it's still in the mail, one more pre-ordered) and I thought this an interesting concept for NWN. I'd just like some ideas though, and since it will be somewhat low-power (prolly) I'll use it single player.<br><br>The Witchers are an order of hardly trained and mutated warriors who use supernatural powers in addition to their swordplay. Their main 'mission' is to defeat supernatural threats to the world, fighting beasts that is, in both human form and otherwise. This still does not make them goodaligned by default, from what I can see. And since Evil so many things, all alignments is good to go. <br><br>Specifics:<b><br>Race</b>: Any, I think. They are all human in the game, but not sure if that's a prereq.<br><b>Alignment</b>: Any, although CE seems to destructive and self-sufficient to me. It's an alignment I've never grasped though, so it could work I just don't see it.<br><b>Combat style</b>: They use Greatswords, some perhaps Bastard. Small races could use bastard. They fight lightly armoured(no heavy armour), or without armor. They have learnt the use of signs, which can be translated to sorcerer-like powers in NWN. Not sure though.<br>I wouldn't care at all about xp-penalties though.<br><br>I'm thinking Strength because of weapon choice. Not so sure about classes. Fighter seem obvious, but Ranger might be just as suited. I'd build it with Tumble for sure and some caster in there in most witchers. Monk could relate to the rigorous and hard physical training, and their resiliency, even their prowess in hand to hand.<br><br>I'll share my first thought.<br>Elven Ranger21+/Wiz10+/assn3+. Or rogue maybe? Asn to avoid xp-penalty. Elf to get some decent DEX when I'm going up the Strength path. Maybe starting like this?<br>STR 14<br>DEX 16<br>CON 12<br>INT 14<br>WIS 14<br>CHA 8<br><br>Timing WIZ levels right, you can muster GrINT feats, f.ex.<br><br>Footnotes. I'm NOT trying to build Geralt, but a witcher. And yes, there's probably a few useful builds already in the guild, but I'd like to invent a build for this purpose with you guys. And also get some discussion going in these forums.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

I'm thinking SOR for that instead of WIZ, simply because I feel that best matches their use of Signs. The CHA required for casting would also be in keeping with the <i>Witcher</i> game (as Geralt seems to have little troubles with the ladies).<br><br>Hmmm... so FTR/SOR would be what I'd look at. Maybe a splash of Assassin to avoid XP penalties, but I'd likely eat the penalty and go with Rogue. I didn't get the impression that Witchers would actually be evil, as they seem to be bent on protecting society whether people like them or not.

I'd actually probably slightly adjust the stats through the console (yeah, yeah, I know... "Cheating") because I feel they have good CON (they have to in order to survive their Witcher training), good DEX, STR is necessary for their weapon choice (two handers), CHA is necessary for Sign (spell) casting, and I think they're quite intelligent as well.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

The stats are the difficult issue indeed. Con to me has to be high, because they withstand incredible punishment and their mutagen training gives them their str and dex. So it's con that opens the door for the other boosts. You could even, in fact, justify leaving the other stats lower and then boosting them with gear or potions as appropriate as part of the mutagen consumption. While that isn't typically ideal, I know, I think it's more consistent with the Witcher concept, as they consume potions to boost the attribute they need for a particular encounter. <br><br>Totally agree about sorcerer over wizard. So Charisma has to be decent as a result. I could see them as evil in the sense of "the end justifies the means." They can be cruel, very cruel, and cruelty is evil in D&amp;D. So assassin would be just as consistent as rogue, IMHO. But you'd have to be an assassin who operates with a particular agenda where the agenda is all. That said, with boosting charisma instead of intel for being a sorcerer, being an assassin is not as rewarding, except for avoiding the xp penalty.

"The end justifies the means" sounds more chaotic than evil, to me. In D&amp;D, actions are more important than motives in determining alignment. They are trying to help non-evil people, so their motivation is good, but they do cruel things to accomplish that, so their D&amp;D alignment has to be evil, specifically chaotic evil. If you're willing to downplay that cruelty, they could be chaotic good.<br><br>Of course, my opinions are far from authorative. I have played neither PnP D&amp;D nor The Witcher.<br>_________________<br>I am endeavoring to construct mnemonic memory circuits, using stone knives and bear skins.

Empyre,<br><br>Some would be CE I think. And certainly most of them would tend towards Chaotic, as they have little order to them, and they rarely so much as travel together. And only fighting together when they are threatened by large groups, though they tend to winter together, but that is consistent with nomadic life as well.<br><br>I don't think any fit in the "black-hearted fiend" category. But they have little use typically for traditional views of right and wrong. And doing what's expedient is entirely acceptable to them if it does the job. Geralt was subjected to very hideous experiments in his training, supposedly.
