I was playing around on the social servers, there you get all different kinds of people, Roleplayes, Powergamers, Ubers, and small children who insult you using every word on the keyboard except the ones with letters...<br><br>A person I know Playing was showing off some builds to me in Pvp, I can survive a bit in combat with my melee bard/cleric/blackguard, but against some builds I merely linger a bit, watching my health slowly fall... Any ways... <br><br>We were having an indepth roleplay situation, and he was attacked by an *** uber... I dont know how, but he did a run and shoot tactic on the uber and managed to kill him, I was wondering if anyone else had witnessed something like this, and if they know of any builds like this... I will try and get a copy of the build for you all to see...<br><br>in normal pvp I see that archers have a bit of an advantage over melee and casters, they have speed and their range, also if the build has high enough dex you can get epic dodge (unless its a wisdom class using zen archery.. but never seen an archer build based on that)  <br><br>Now I will admit... The items the archer had were all maxed out, all legal, but probably plus 12 stats and 50 resists to damages... no immunties though (I inspected him), The uber had many bad STREFFD items, like damage bonus vs none etc. <br><br>ok.. enough of me speaking crazily.. let me get to the point...<br><br>Would you consider Archer builds best in pvp? and if you want post some favorites.. I will as soon as I speak to my friend who built his<br>_________________<br>When the Trickster starts a-walking,<br>He sets the whole world askew...<br>Just when you thing that it's all through,<br>It's just the birth of something new.

I haven't done any PvP yet, but of all builds I tried and the builds I made myself, the archer seems to be the one who can handle most opponents without much trouble (in the "Novice to Epic character Maker" mod). And when testing I only use a high level bow and high level armor, no stat boosts or other enhancements.<br><br>So I wouldn't be surprised if the archer was best in PvP.

The best two pvp archers out there, are the bard/aa/pm builds and the bard/aa/rdd builds. The rdd versions will have an added advantage of dev crit in the next patch, while the pm versions are immune to crits.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Id say your wrong Emrill. How good is a AA with devastating critical at pvp? Max 19-20 critical range low str meaning low DC.<br><br>IMO the best ARCHER is a normal monk10/wiz1/aa29.<br><br>But the Archer is NOT the best at PvP. I know thousands of builds that can take em easily.. (if they arnt laming, like run shot run shot)

Against a non-TS creature or somewhere with a TS fix, a Bard9-11/Shadowdancer 2-10/Arcane Archer 19-27 is extremely good in PvP (in PvM you come across many creatures with TS innately as properties).<br><br>A hit-and-run is a monk 10/Wiz1/AA 29.<br><br>The Dev Critters will be strong, but still suffer from needing to go up to 25, all those feats and needing good Dex to maintain AA ABs. The only viable route for that is with RDD.

I wouldnt mind seeing a bard-dd-pm against one of those archers. I know its requires 2 alligment shifts but to me a dexed bard-dd-pm with rapier is the king in pvp. Immune to sneaks and crits, insane ac, good ab and crits, warding and epic mage armour, curse song, taunt, umd, you name it. <br><br>I think its bard16, dd8, 16 pm and is the best ive seen sofar.

If it's high magic PvP with +20 AC and 50 resist, Archers probably suck against most opponents. The are only strong, when they are able to crit... <br><br>Personally i never saw an archer defeating an equally skilled player with whatever melee class in such environments.<br><br>So, if the AC is limited, they might be powerful, because of their high AB. But as soon, as they meet an enemy with at least (archers AB + 26) AC and maybe even conceal and epic dr III, they are dead meat, unless their opponent is a noob with a really bad build.

In +20 AC PvP that build would be nice cannonfodder, like all dex builds... as soon, as they can't crit anymore, they do almost no damage.<br><br>That is also the reason why i don't like 12 AC PvP. It limits the possibilities of building a decent char to very few class combinations. I like the diversity...
