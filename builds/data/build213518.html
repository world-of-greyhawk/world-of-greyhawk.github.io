<b>PVM build, playable lvl 1-40</b><br><br>This is a basic foot-soldier, as can be found in any army. He has survived many battles and has considerable experience in close combat. Whith his trusty longsword and shield he can charge into the fray, but he's equally skilled in the use of the spear for fighting mounted enemies. With plenty of combat maneuvres at his disposal, as well as extensive basic combat skills, he can dispose of most enemies without too much effort.<br><br><b>Abilities:</b><br>Str 15 -&gt; 26<br>Dex 14<br>Con 14<br>Wis 8<br>Int 14<br>Cha 12<br><br><b>Race:</b> Human<br><b>Alignment:</b> Any non-lawful<br><br><b>1</b> bard 1, dodge, knockdown<br><b>2</b> figh 1, weapon focus(longsword)<br><b>3</b> figh 2, weapon focus(spear), expertise<br><b>4</b> figh 3, (+str)<br><b>5</b> figh 4, weapon spec(longsword)<br><b>6</b> figh 5, mobility<br><b>7</b> bard 2<br><b>8</b> figh 6, spring attack, (+str)<br><b>9</b> figh 7, whirlwind<br><b>10</b> bard 3<br><b>11</b> figh 8, weapon spec(longsword)<br><b>12</b> WM 1, imp crit(longsword), weapon of choice(longsword), (+str)<br><b>13</b> WM 2<br><b>14</b> WM 3<br><b>15</b> WM 4, power attack<br><b>16</b> WM 5, (+str)<br><b>17</b> WM 6<br><b>18</b> WM 7, imp crit(spear)<br><b>19</b> WM 8<br><b>20</b> bard 4, (+str)<br><b>21</b> WM 9, IWF(longsword)<br><b>22</b> WM 10<br><b>23</b> WM 11<br><b>24</b> figh 9, IWS(longsword), (+str)<br><b>25</b> WM 12<br><b>26</b> WM 13, weapon of choice(spear)<br><b>27</b> bard 5, disarm<br><b>28</b> WM 14, (+str)<br><b>29</b> WM 15<br><b>30</b> WM 16, imp disarm, EWF(spear)<br><b>31</b> figh 10, EWS(spear)<br><b>32</b> WM 17, (+str)<br><b>33</b> WM 18, IKD<br><b>34</b> WM 19, armor skin<br><b>35</b> WM 20<br><b>36</b> WM 21, imp power attack, (+str)<br><b>37</b> WM 22, epic prowess<br><b>38</b> figh 11<br><b>39</b> figh 12, great strength, blind-fight<br><b>40</b> bard 6, (+str)<br><br><b>Recommended skills:</b><br>Concentration 43 (45)<br>Discipline 43 (51)<br>Intimidate 4 (5)<br>Perform 11 (12)<br>Spellcraft 43 (45)<br>Tumble 40 (42)<br>45 remaining, split them between UMD and heal as you like<br><br><b>Unbuffed stats:</b><br><b>HP</b> 456<br><b>AC</b> 32 (with full plate and tower shield)<br><b>AB</b> 46/41/36/31  (with longsword or spear)<br><b>Damage</b> 1-8 +14 (critical 15-20 / 3x)(with longsword)<br><b>Damage</b> 1-8 +18 (critical 17-20 / 4x)(with spear)<br><b>Saves:</b> (vs. spells)<br>Fortitude 21 (30)<br>Reflex 24 (33)<br>Will 17 (26)<br><br>Bard song can be used to get an extra +1 to ab, saves and skills and +2 dam.

Interesting build. I would say with so many levels of WM, he's not your typical soldier.<br><br>Note that you have Weapon Spec: Longsword twice<br>How about moving Bard 3 to level 12 to max. Tumble?<br>How about dropping Power Attack at 15 for Improved Knockdown?<br>Note at 21 and 24 you have Epic Weapon Focus and Spec as "IWF" and "IWS"<br>Do Disarm and Imp. Disarm work right now? I thought they were bugged by one of the latest patches.<br><br>That's all I can think of right now. Nice job!<br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br><i>This space for rent</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kaliban99 on 09/21/05 02:40</span></i></p>

Thanks for the input, all good points really. <br>I felt that a typical soldier would be something like a lvl 10-12 fighter perhaps, and in becoming a veteran he might become something like a weapon master, but I could be wrong. Of course it's pretty odd for a newly trained soldier to have the feats I take on the first 10 levels, but I think the name works pretty well with the end result. I'm a bit more worried about the bard levels myself, but everyone's gotta have a hobby. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br>I didn't know disarm was bugged, can you post a link to a description of the problem?<br>I spent a lot of time moving feats around, I feel it's a bit feat-starved on the whole (for what I wanted to do), but with a pretty good ab I felt that power attack could be quite helpful to have early on. When I get to level 15 I'll see if I hit often enough for power attack to be worth it, or if my kd needs a boost. Perhaps IKD would be better.<br>I'll post a new leveling plan without the typos and with bard on 12.

A nice little damage dealer there. I to feel that a WM build often gets somewhat feat-starved, because of the prereq's. Thats why I never invest in it with just 7 WM levels. I take a lot, like you do. Your AB is good, but not to good for a non-buffer. (Nearly non, at least <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  )<br>So I agree on the PA part with Christian. I really don't think IPA to be of any use, unless you somewhere along the road gets into a battle of 20's. Then 10 extra damage becomes goooood. Its environmental, as always. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br>Nice veteran to. Make him an middle-aged portrait and you're there.
