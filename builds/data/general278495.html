Ok so I'm working on a "battle druid" that does't use it's shifting abilities, just it's casting and weapons (yes I know this weakens the character but hey I'm good with odd concepts <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  ). What I need to know (since im no spell slinger) is how high my wisdom should end up   for either <i>druid 20</i>/whatever/whatever<br>or <i>druid 28</i>/whatever/whatever <br>neither of the other classes i'll be using are "wisdom based" so its just for maximising the druids <i>spell casting abilities</i>. I can figure out the starting ability level (well most likely I can) if I know how high to take it in the end. <br><br>Any help, is of course greatly appreciated.<br>_________________<br>In the name of justice, I spite all misdeeds.

Well, I made <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "262121", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>this</a> build as a caster Druid, and it doesn't really fights shifting except for the obvious playable reasons at low levels.<br><br>Besides saying that Monk is a good addition when being WIS based, there are several stuff to consider.<br><br>What do you want for the other classes? as far as spellcasting is concerned, you should go over 30 Druid levels and take Epic Spell Focus, so for spellpower you should take a low amount of levels on your other classes.<br><br>Champion of Torm gets Great Wisdom as bonus feat, so it can be useful to pump up WIS for your DCs.<br><br>If you want to fight melee you can very well take Fighter, it's a no-brainer for added damage.<br><br>You could also take Arcane Archer, a Druid 20 / Wizard 1 / Arcane Archer 19 with Zen Archery (or a variant in spread for more spellpower) will get a high AB, and a good damage bonus from AA, that one is a sure one to work good. At any rate, taking Zen Archery is a good choice for a WIS based character, it can also work out like a Druid/Fighter/Rogue, since not only AA can add damage to a bow, EWS or sneak attack are also viable options.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.
