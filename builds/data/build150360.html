I know he can. It just looks like a lot of feats waste to get one feat, when a lot of other feats could greatly enhance his spellcasting powers.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

If he concentrates on spells that have no saves, or just buffs, he becomes a quite scary melee character.  He's got epic warding for 50/+20 DR, a bucket o' bigby (tm), timestop, IGMS, and all the wizard AND cleric buffs.  There's not much reason to try and increase save DCs when his spells aren't using saves... and the durations will be long enough.  He's also got more than enough spells to spare, so increasing his intelligence or wisdom any higher than he has to would be useless.  He might as well get the most powerful melee feat in the game. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>"Intelligence is knowing a tomato is a fruit; Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad."

MA Sword's point is correct, and also - making this character better in magic and worse in fighting would make it less versatile, which was not the purpose.

Tengudor, here is a slight variation on your build that gets much higher HP (+160 or so), although it loses Epic Spells and gets an XP penalty.  <br><br><br>Cleric 17/Fighter 6/Wizard 17<br>(pre-epic Cleric 15/Fighter 1/Wizard 4)<br><br>Race: Dwarf<br><br>Domains: Stength and Healing<br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting:<br><br>Str 14 <br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 16<br>Wis 16<br>Cha 6<br><br>Ending:<br><br>Str 25<br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 19<br>Wis 19<br>Cha 6<br><br>Feats<br><br>Pre-epic:<br><br>1 Power Attack <br>3 Cleave<br>6 Still Spell<br>9 Toughness<br>12 Imp.

Good character, but I think gaining 120 HP isn't worth losing Epic Mage Armor and especially Epic Warding - the dwarf would die afst to a melee fighter, but he'd be a bigger challenge for a spellcaster.

Kinda reminds me of chndragons old build, only not quite so complex.  Sometimes you dont need to get too fancy. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   I've always liked the dual-caster builds (like 6/17/17 Monk/Druid/Cleric, etc) even if they dont have the oomph to break high level SR.  They usually have enough to break the typical PvM SR, and thats good enough for me. Likewise, I tend to skip the Epic Spells, since you always get them so late in the build, its spent its whole like without them, and I've gotten used to not having them. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Normal kids play rock-paper-scissors.<br>Shifter kids play IronGolem-RustMonster-MindFlayer. . .
