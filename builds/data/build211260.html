Inspired by a conversation on the NWN General Discussion Forum<br>Although a rather weak character at level 40 I found him quite <b>playable 1-40 PvM</b><br><br><b>A Disgrace to the Family</b><br><br>Catch this week’s episode of Faerun’s favourite soap, <i>Cormyrian Knights,</i> ‘A Disgrace to the Family’.<br><br><b>Recap:</b> Miles has been summoned home by Sir Giles who hopes to convince his wayward son to return to Cormyr and take up the family sword.<br>	Miles is reluctant, knowing that his father is angry with him and does not know that he is obeying the instructions of the master of his order, and will not understand that Miles too does his duty to Cormyr and for the cause of justice and order as best he can.<br>	Meanwhile Vilmira waits pensively at camp. Although she knows her love for Sir Miles is unrequited and hopeless, still the renegade Drow would be heartbroken if Miles decided to leave the troupe and return home.<br><br><b>This Episode:</b> Sir Giles glared at his only son,<br>	<i>‘Miles, although I was disappointed when you chose to become a monk I did not oppose you. It is a honourable occupation although not the one I would have chosen for you.	<br>	When you chose to join a fighting order I was proud. The ways of your order may not be those I am used to but I can respect them.<br>	Now however you have chosen to abandon your order and join a vagabond troupe of travelling players. My son sometimes before you have disappointed me but now you shame me. I beg you, reconsider this hasty decision. If you will not or cannot return to your order then come home. There is still a place for you here’.</i><br>	Miles hesitated before speaking,<br>		<i>‘Father, you may find this hard to accept but this vagabond troupe is now my home and not one I can or will give up’.</i><br>	Sir Giles lost his temper,<br>		<i>‘If that is your final word then leave this house and never darken it’s doors again. You are a disgrace to the family and no son of mine!’</i><br>	Miles left without saying a word.<br>	Sir Giles followed his son to the door but as Miles rode away he did not look back nor would Sir Giles call out to him. As Miles disappeared from view the old knights shoulders sagged and he slowly walked back into the manor, no longer a home.<br>	As Miles returned to his troupes camp he brooded on his fathers words. He would likely die, executed on some false accusation, in an enemy camp and his father and peers would doubtless believe the story, never knowing why he had died, his name forever dishonoured. Still that was the duty he had been given and carry it out he would.<br>	When Miles returned to the encampment Vilmira knew his private business had not gone well. Despite his training she could always read his mood. She decided to speak of their next mission instead,<br>	<i>‘Sir, we have received permission to perform in Zhentil Keep. They await our arrival’.</i><br>	Miles was terse,<br>		<i>‘Very well, Vilmira, we will commence the journey at dawn tomorrow. Issue the necessary orders’.</i><br>	As his lieutenant began barking out orders Miles looked around the motley crew of rogues and villains he commanded. There wasn’t one he could really trust or call a friend except Vilmira, but best not to think about that, it could never be. Why, Hugo would’ve been hung if he hadn’t volunteered for military service, and Miles was not sure how far he could trust the wily rogue.<br><br><b>Next Episode:</b> Will Miles and Vilmira ever realise their love is mutual?<br>If so will Miles break his vow of chastity?<br>Does Hugo plan to betray the troupe or is there a spark of Cormyrian patriotism in that wily rogues black heart?<br>Is the mission to Zhentil Keep the cunning masterstroke Miles believes it to be or is he leading the troupe into a deadly trap?<br>And what of Sir Giles, devastated by his only sons apparent abandonment of family tradition and honour?<br>Will he succumb to the blandishments of the beautiful but frequently widowed Lady Zenobia?<br>Find out all this and more in the next episode of <i>Cormyrian Knights.</i>  <br><br><b>A Disgrace to the Family </b>(Monk 6/Paladin 15/ Shadow dancer 19)<br><br>Race: Human	<br>Alignment: Lawful Good<br><br>Abilities<br>STR 10<br>DEX 18/32<br>CON 10<br>INT 10<br>WIS 14<br>CHA 10<br>All ability increases go to DEX<br><br>Levelling &amp; Feats<br>1-2: Monk (1-2) – Dodge (1), Mobility (1)<br>3-6: Paladin (1-4) – Weapon Finesse (3), Weapon Focus: Kama<br>7: Monk (3)<br>8-11: Shadow dancer (1-4) – TWF (9)<br>12-13: Monk (4-5) – IC: Kama (12)<br>14-16: Paladin (5-7) – Ambidexterity (15)<br>17: Monk (6) <br>18-21: Paladin (8-11) – ITWF (18), GRT DEX I (21)<br>22: Shadow dancer (5)<br>23-25: Paladin (12-14) –GRT DEX II (24)<br>16-39: Shadow dancer (6-19) – GRT DEX III (27), GRT DEX IV (30), Epic Dodge (33), SC I (33)*, SC II (36), SC III (36)*, SC IV (39), SC V (39)*<br>40: Paladin (15)<br>* Shadow dancer Epic Bonus Feat<br><br>STATS<br>AC (Robes): 32<br>HP (Maxed): 350<br>AB (Kama): +39/+36/+33/+30/+27/+24*<br>Damage (kama): 1-6 (Crit 19-20/x2)<br>Fort: +23<br>Refl: +33<br>Will: +21<br>BAB: +27<br>·	I’m not going through the whole DW/Flurry/Haste thing as you all know it off by heart, suffice it to say a possible 10 attacks/round at a mediocre AB<br><br>Skills<br>Discipline 43<br>Hide 42<br>Move Silently 42<br>Tumble 40<br>56 to spend as desired.<br><br>Pros<br>Interesting RP opportunities<br>Paladin Buffs<br>SC 5 and Epic Dodge<br><br><br>Cons<br>Mediocre AB and Damage for a Melee Fighter<br>Poor Hit Points for Anybody<br>Only Good Save is Refl although Still Mind and Slippery Mind help out with the Will save<br>Has trouble doing damage<br><br>Magic Item Wishlist<br>Obviously a pair of deadly kamas and a Haste item<br>Other than that Attribute increasing items especially +4 WIS so that he can get 4th level Paladin spells at 25th rather than 40th level<br><br><br>edit: more corn anybody <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>....    ....    ....    ....<br><i>griphook ..Edited "AC" Typo</i><br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 09/04/05 23:03</span></i></p>

A Disgrace to the Family version 2.0 (Monk 6/Cleric 12/SD 22)<br><br>A rebuild of my original version that seeks to give the build a little more offensive power using cleric buffing spells, especially Divine Power. Thanks go to Cinnabar for explaining to others and me the usefulness of this spell, especially for a build of BAB 15 or less. Although built in a levelling up module I haven’t played it yet but it looks as if it should be considerably more effective than the original build.<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Any Lawful (Lawful Good or Neutral fits the character concept I had in mind best)<br>Domains: Strength and Trickery<br><br>Abilities<br>STR 10<br>DEX 18/30<br>CON 10<br>INT 12<br>WIS 14/16<br>CHA 08<br><br>The first 8 ability increases go to DEX, the last 2 to WIS.<br><br>Levelling &amp; Feats<br>1-2: Monk (1-2) – Dodge (1), Mobility (1)<br>3-6: Cleric (1-4) – Weapon Finesse (3), Weapon Focus: Kama (6)<br>7: Monk (3) <br>8-11: Cleric (5-8) – TWF (9)<br>12-19: Shadowdancer (1-8) – Ambidexterity (12), IC: Kama (15), ITWF (18)<br>20: Monk (4)<br>21-27: Shadowdancer (9-15) – GRT DEX I (21), GRT DEX II (24), Epic Dodge (25)*, GRT DEX III (27)<br>28: Monk (5)<br>29-31: Cleric  (9-11) – GRT DEX IV (30)<br>32-38: Shadowdancer (16-22) – SC I (32)*, SC II (33), SC III (35)*, SC IV (36), SC V (38)*<br>39: Cleric (12) – EWF: Kama<br>40: Monk (6)<br>* Shadowdancer Epic Bonus Feat<br><br>Skill Points = 278<br>Concentration 43<br>Disable Traps 1<br>Discipline 43<br>Hide 43<br>Move Silently 43<br>Open Locks 1<br>Pick Pockets 1<br>Spellcraft 39<br>Tumble 40<br>This leaves 14 points to distribute as desired.<br><br>Spells<br>Cantrips (6): Resistance, Virtue<br>1st level (7): Bless, Divine Favour, Protection From Alignment, Shield of Faith<br>2nd level (6): Bull’s Strength, Endurance, Owl’s Wisdom<br>3rd level (6): Darkfire, Divine Power, Magic Vestment, Negative Energy Protection, Prayer<br>4th level (4): Death Ward, Divine Power, Greater Magic Weapon<br>5th level (4): Improved Invisibility, Spell Resistance, Stoneskin, True Seeing<br>6th level (3)<br><br>I’ve just listed what seem to me to be the most useful clerical buffs but I don’t often play clerics so I may have missed some. The remaining slots can be filled with extra uses of short duration buffs (especially Divine Power), yet more buffs for allies or in case they get dispelled, and other useful spells e.g. healing spells, summons etc.<br><br>STATS<br>AC (Robes): 32<br>HP (Maxed): 320<br>AB (Kama): +38/+35/+32/+29/+26<br>Damage (Kama): 1-6 (Crit 19-20/x2)<br>Fort: 22<br>Refl: 32<br>Will: 25<br>BAB: 25<br><br>Pros and Cons<br>Retains the considerable defensive abilities of the original build and can enhance them and his offensive abilities considerably with buffing spells. Loses 1 AB and 1 attack compared to the original but with Divine Power will actually be a better fighter than the original.<br><br>Problems<br>Although both Domain powers are useful they don’t last long. Also the build doesn’t get access to 5th level spells until 36th level. Since the build gets SC IV at 36th level this means Improved Invisibility isn’t all that useful. There may be a better choice than Trickery for the 2nd domain. From an RP point of view Knowledge would fit.<br>It seems a great pity to only get KD and IKD at 40th level.<br>There are some feats the build doesn’t have that I would’ve liked especially Blind-fight, Extend Spell and Empower Spell. The only way I can see to get them is by dropping the dual-weapon feats. The build could still get 8 attacks a round with Divine Power, Flurry and Haste so it might be worth doing.<br><br>Partial Solutions – versions 2.1 and 2.2<br>Version 2.1 – Levels are changed to Monk 7/ Cleric 14/ SD 19 meaning EWF: Kama will be lost. 2 points are taken off either STR or INT and 1 added to WIS.<br>Advantages are KD, IKD and 5th level spells can be gained much earlier and eventually the build will have 7th level spells.<br>Disadvantages are the loss of AB and if STR is lost the build will have an even harder time at low levels but if INT is lost it will be starved for skill points. Also WIS ends on 17 and 15th level cleric is much better for many buffing spells than 14th.<br><br>Version 2.2 – Levels are changed to Monk 6/Cleric 15/SD 19. Again EWF: Kama is lost. 2 points are lost from both STR and INT and 2 added to WIS.<br>Advantages are +1 AC, +1 Will Saving Throw, earlier access to 5th and 6th level spells, eventual access to 8th level spells and ending with a nice tidy 18 WIS.<br>Disadvantages are back to not getting KD and IKD until 40th level, loss of AB, a hard time until Weapon Finesse and Divine Power are gained, and a shortage of skill points.<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Amazon Queen on 09/05/05 15:36</span></i></p>

I like the paladin combo better myself. Maybe your cleric version should take a few more monk levels to gain back some paladin immunities.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

I worried that the Paladin version suffered from having too many attributes that were important to him and was spread a bit thin. I also worried that for someone with quite a few fighter-type levels he wasn't a particularly good fighter although admittedly the Paladin spells helped out there,<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

I just like it for more of an original class combo. Cleric monks are all over, but you don't see to many paly monks. Also in the forgotten realms lore, I belive one of the monk sects were able to multiclass with paladin freely. I'd have to go double check though.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

I think Ilmatar qualifies for Paladin/Monks<br>Mind you the other Cleric/Monk/SD builds go for Empty Body or Improved Invisibility rather than SC5. It may be there are good reasons for prefering those routes though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br>If you look at medeval Europe many priests came from a monastic background, the religious fighting orders imposed a monastic lifestyle on their members and included priests amongst their members, so from a European POV any combination of monk, paladin or cleric would be possible, except I suppose D&amp;D monks don't bear much resemblance to their Western feudal counterparts<br>Just defeated my own argument again <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif"><br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.
