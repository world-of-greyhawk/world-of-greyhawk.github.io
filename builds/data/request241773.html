<b>Robert Tyr</b><br>Joined: 01 Feb 2005<br>From: Mid-West, USA<br>Profile: Thursday, 25 May 2006 10:16AM <br><br><br>Epic Character Builds - The Death Dealer <br>Created by: Deborah “Tyr”<br><br>He is a blood-thirsty assassin, an epic monk turned mercenary, and pirate (fighter) commander, but it's not that he lacks charm or grace. With impeccable martial arts mastery, and devout attention to anatomy and stealth, he’s mastered the art of death: his palm incredibly swift, more deadly than any blade, with a body tougher than plate armor. <br><br>As an epic monk, bolstered by levels of fighter and the prestige class of assassin, this character excels in the art of dealing quick, lethal blows, and takes great pride in his work.<br><br>The horror he’d see in the eyes of his victims, their blood-soaked bodies crumpling to the ground as they gasped their last breath, pleased him. Satisfied with his kill, he’d soon disappear into the shadows, making his getaway under cover of stealth, and be far, far away before any hint of the crime was discovered. Yes, he was a murderer, a cold-blooded mercenary, and he loved it.  And this, his love of the “kill”, the rush he always experienced when running his victims through, when toying with them like a dire tiger mauling a tiny mouse, might even have been forgiven by the Order. Nothing wrong, perhaps, with a devout monk, a monk who had trained hard to be a stealth killer, taking a little pride in his work; but only if it was done to advance the Order. Unforgivable, however, was his love of gold, and the way it shimmered. It was gold that made Death Dealer sing, for which he was cast from the Order. <br><br>At first, he was upset enough to plot revenge, but he soon got on with his life as a mercenary. His title as outlaw, atop his already impeccable credentials, clearly worked to his favor in his line of work. In time, he would receive a special assignment, one which would lead him back to the Order, on a mission to terminate his old Master. His skills having been honed since that day, so long ago, when he was cast out, Death Dealer was up for the challenge; he would have his revenge.<br><br>It was quite easy for Death Dealer to enter his old temple, unnoticed by a single soul, but the Master was out. So, Death Dealer waited. Not a sound, not a stir did he make; patiently, he waited. When the Master did return, on entering his room, the trap was instantly sprung. Like a bolt of lighting, and with shocking precision, Death Dealer leaped. In an instant, he had bested his former master; it took but a single blow. The dying man whispered, one final breath: “Why kill me now, after all of these years?” <br><br>Perhaps, out of respect, the Death Dealer responded with an answer.  “You have trained me well, Master, from whom I learned great discipline; I take my vengeance now because it tastes sweeter when cold, and because your death is finally worth something to me in gold.”<br><br>The Death Dealer is evil because he is a mercenary, a highly trained killer-for-hire: his loyalties are bought and sold by only the highest of bidders.<br><br>Special note from the author: the Death Dealer is based on a real-life, historical figure: Eustace the Monk. Dubbed also the “Black Monk,” he was the son of a noble, spending time at a monastery before becoming a pirate commander, and mercenary. His ability to seemingly appear out of nowhere, and fighting prowess, resulted in many believing he practiced sorcery; he was an assassin, an epic monk turned mercenary, who satisfied his thirst for gold by selling his services to the highest bidder. Being one of the most notorious mercenaries of his day, he is the perfect medieval outlaw, and an irresistible villain-type character.<br><br><br><br>Key Advantages<br>•	Against all foes, the Death Dealer is deadly; with his epic stealth and +7d6 death attack, coupled with his monk speed, stunning fists and quivering palm abilities, his first strike on a victim, like that of a poisonous viper laying in wait, is often all that it takes to bring down his victim.<br>•	Epic Stealth and Speed: It is far easier to win a battle if your opponent not only never gets a chance to strike back, but doesn’t even see you coming, with the Death Dealer’s Move Silently and Hide Skills being maximized, accordingly. In addition to many years of rogue (assassin) training, he/she is an epic monk, having high concealment, monk speed, and other special abilities. Like a shark circling from deep beneath the water, Death Dealer’s victims are unaware of the danger they’re in, being unable to see him until after he strikes, when it’s too late. <br>•	High AC, High HPs and Great Health (Immunities): in addition to being essentially immune to poison, disease, mind-spells, and also having a naturally high magic resistance, the Death Dealer is the perfect picture of health and vitality. Likewise, he is a bastion of defense, with high AC and tumbling skills, which have been maximized.<br>•	Epic Martial Arts Fighting Ability: The Death Dealer is a double-black belt, martial arts master, able to disarm the mightiest of foes (improved disarm), and out maneuver a dragon (improved knockdown). Whether bare-fisted or wielding a Kama, the Death Dealer has trained long and hard, such that he/she is able to strike fast, strike hard, and strike often. <br>•	Lethal Unarmed Attacks: To be able to use unarmed attacks that cause as much damage in combat as a trained fighter having a magic weapon is an incredible feat, and it is a feat that the Death Dealer has assuredly mastered.  With epic prowess, epic focus/epic specialization, monk speed, and extra bonus attacks per round, the Death Dealer is nothing short of lethal. <br><br>The Death Dealer: <br><br>Overview:<br><br>Epic Monk (21), Fighter (Pirate) (6), Rogue (Mercenary/Assassin) (13)<br><br>Race: Human  <br>Alignment: Lawful Evil<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>STR: 13<br>DEX: 14 <br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 15 <br>INT: 13<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Final Stats:<br>STR: 13<br>DEX: 26<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 18<br>INT: 13<br>CHA: 8<br><br><br>BAB: 26<br>AB: +38 (naked, unarmed)<br><br>Note: Monks get a special Unarmed Attack Bonus Chart (as opposed to BAB) which boosts BAB when engaged in unarmed combat; in addition, whether in unarmed combat or wielding Kamas, epic monks are fast, having up to 8-10 attacks/round (the highest number in the realm). <br><br><br>Damage: <br>•	Unarmed Attack (naked, and no gloves): 1-20, +* modifier, x 5 attacks/round (normal mode)<br><br>Monk Bonus: If in “flurry of blows” mode, can enjoy up to 8 attacks/round for unarmed attack, or 10 attacks/round with two Kamas, but suffer penalties to their attack rolls.

<b>Robert Tyr</b><br>Joined: 01 Feb 2005<br>From: Mid-West, USA<br>Profile: Thursday, 25 May 2006 09:11PM <br><br><br>Hey, guys: thanks for the great comments and interest, as always! Should note some of the changes on this build <br><br>monks get improved evasion for free, and also defensive roll for free (called something else)-it was suggested to me here that, if I dropped WIS, and went DEX instead, and changed Assassin to Rogue 13, that qualifies for epic dodge (and it does show up); I was worried about that too.<br><br>to do this, i had to drop wis (it was high; had a nice DC as a result, easily max'd with wis-boost equip't; now it's dc 35 or 36 (gotta check again), which is lower than I like it (was at dc 38); however, with wis-boost equip't, DC's brought up into the low 40s, with a simple +12 wis amulet (his immunities and naturally high AC open euip't slots up nicely; other than level/ability drain, if going up against undead, he's pretty much got it all, with lots of room to maneuve, unlike a fighter who needs to boost everything). Nice thing about this character, in terms of AC, it's high; boost Wis and this authomatically goes into his AC also, as does Dex. Dex also raises his AB, as do simple monk gloves. <br><br>He also gets the AB boost from improved knockdown AND improved disarm (which does NOT provoke any attack of opportunity; can't hurt/sling him if you're disarmed and/or on your back, with the opponent's AC reduced also according; a beautiful thing in fact). Now, follow through - all those extra attacks; the opponent's not going anywhere, and is unlikely to get up.<br><br>Oh, and I do assure you: with very, very mundane +7 gloves only, totally nothing special, he DID knock down a dragon; an ancient gold dragon in fact -- oh, it was so beautiful to watch! And he stunned spell slingers just fine; boost his WIS (like the ftr boost their strength) and oh, what fun that will be. He can escape first round damage entirely; and with all that damage reduction, etc. etc. etc., well . . . it adds up very nicely.<br><br>AB 26, +38 is good for a sneaker (it's usually lower, at about 35-37); Now, add in the special monk table for unarmed strike . . . and that's before he puts on any gloves or equip't; with monk gloves (they all come with attack bonus, as well as damage) -- Thus, with a simple pair of monk golves, his AB is as high as an epic fighter. <br><br>Also, the sneak attack 7d6, don't underestimate that; his AB well in range (high melee actually, remember, ALL monks where gloves) - that's 7d6 x's 5 attacks/round; throw on haste and/or flurry of blows mode, and that's 8 or more attacks per round, (sneak attacks works with monk speed, etc.; it's a beautiful thing to watch! - and thereafter, he can dish it out with his really cool 1-20 plus MOD damage (again, that's EACH attack, times many attacks, per round).  Alternatively, with his great stealth, for those having over 500 HPs, well, he knocks 'em in half the first round, goes back into stealth mode (no pause required); comes back and *kaboom* Job is done; also a very beautiful thing to watch. Give him haste, and he'll likely do it the first round (hee hee). Note: he's already the equivalent of a hasted creature/character, monk speed alone; but give him haste also - it stacks, and he's soooooo fast, it's absolutely amazing! If he ever retires as a mercenary/assassin, this guy can keep up with Hermes!<br><br>True, unlike assassin's, rogues don't get improved invis., but it's a small price to pay when there's all that great extra damage dished out. Once again, though this character's designed for PvM, with the rougue's higher sneak dam. than the assasin's death attack (and yes, that works beautifully too with monk speed/extra attacks!); however, with this switch, this character can now dish out extra first-strike damage - put on his monk gloves (no one goes out naked, especially a devout monk; humility, remember <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    ) -- and enjoy! <br><br>As for switching assassin for rogue, true, lost the 'death attack' - but that's a DC check also; no such thing for sneak. Also, lost a few HPs as there's a penalty which otherwise wouldn't be suffered with the assasin; but he's still over 400, and that's high, especially for a sneaker! And by making him Dex-based, that too goes straight into his AB . . . yep, made him for PvM, but easily adjusted with the right equipt't for PvP (as are ALL other characters! This guy's got it all; and with that great stealth and truly unique monk abilities . . .  oh, how fun is he to play)<br><br>But, indeed, let's make him even better if we can; this is my first villain; I think we're just about there, but, surely, in this crowd....oh, let's have some fun!<br><br>Tyr<br><br><br>**********<br><br><b>FinneousPJ</b><br>Joined: 24 Feb 2005<br>From: Det Frysende Nordariket<br>Profile: Thursday, 25 May 2006 09:32PM <br><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 05/25/06 19:11:28 (GMT) -- Robert Tyr<br><br>Hey, guys: thanks for the great comments and interest, as always!

As I get this hasn't got revised by the author yet, so posting:<br><br>Whoa, have you ever played dunno, the OCs for reference? those items are just high. Besides, if you're counting that you can get +7 gloves and +12 WIS amulet like if it was trash, what freakingly crazy ACs can a guy with a shield can get, not even needing PM levels, like +50 AC in items easily I think, you wouldn't hit a damn in PvP, you should notice that a real high AB warrior type (Weapon Masters mainly) can get naked unbuffed ABs over 50.<br><br>Hmmm, don't you notice that those things you state the monk has are extremely unbalanced? some people don't like the cheesy 10 APR (only Hasted though, don't say it as if it was natural), but you want to add magically +15 AB out of nowhere like if monk was the magical class that makes you immortal instantaniously, sorry, but you have several stats mistaken, the chart of AB bonus on the manual does not add to the BAB, it's practically how the BAB will work for a monk, pointing out the APR progression. You're right, monks don't get a warrior BAB chart, they get a worse one.<br><br>You Knockdown an NPC dragon? no big deal, try to KD dragons built here, lucky you 'cause a 20 roll is the only thing that will allow you to even hit them, ACs are around 80 minimum.<br><br>Hey Kail, what do you mean that Rogue is always superior to Assassin? no way that's true, Assassins get Improved Invisibility and Death Attack paralisis with a good DC kills and kills (those who are not immune of course).<br><br>Wait a second, Epic Dodge shows up where? because in the game it won't without Defensive Roll, where are you testing this stuff?<br><br>Alright, enough of that, on to suggestions.<br><br>If you have a high magical world go kama instead of unarmed, it will be way stronger, 1d20 = 1-20 is nothing compared to let's say (what is not mundane to you?) a +12 kama dealing 1d6+12 = 13-18, much higher base damage, and you should, or rather must be able to get magical damage to the kama, 1d6, 1d10, 2d6 or freakin' 2d12, sometimes you catch up to gloves, of course, depends on the setting, we could help you a little bit better if you tell us how is your setting. <br><br>Your BAB is 26, you can improve that by losing Monk for Fighter pre-epic, and overall, more fighter levels could help you, if you do change to kama, you don't need so many levels of monk, take Fighter levels instead to take Ambidexterity, Two Weapon Fighting and Improved Two Weapon Fighting pre-epic (you ain't getting 10 APR without ITWF, and you don't have it, so don't say you do), you will deal so much more than unarmed with two kamas with EWS in a high magical world. All focuses change to kama instead.<br><br>I would do something like Rogue 16 / Monk 10 / Fighter 14, that will also give another Rogue bonus feat, so that you can get Crippling, Defensive Roll and Epic Dodge.<br><br>Last, stats, it was mentioned that you have too much WIS, and it's correct, forget Stunning Fists (also the feat) and take kama, your DC is crap (this is some DC: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "238749", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Stunning Claw</a>) so it won't be useful anyway, change WIS for DEX, that will give you AB, you got a lot of odd scores there, why STR 13? make STR 12, DEX 15, WIS 14 and INT 14, counting Great DEX V you will end with 30 DEX, I would even change CON to 12 to increase DEX to 16 at level 1 and change Epic Prowess to Great DEX VI (in the current, not sure if with more Fighter levels you can get Great DEX VI without losing Epic Prowess) because that DEX change will give you the same AB that EP but also +1 AC and reflex.<br><br>EDIT: Forgot to mention, you <i>can</i> go Stealth mode without HiPS when enemies are watching or attacking you, I've done it, but it's not 100% effective like with HiPS, you need to go off combat mode (which should take a round of running), howver, I think that your check has to be superb compared to the opposed (Search, Listen, whatever, not sure which) check.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 05/25/06 22:53</span></i></p>

II from assassin is no big deal at all, it's usable once a day only and UMD will make up for it more often than not. Death attack DC with few assassin lvls will be crap also. Assassin can be a better choice if XP penalty is an issue, but otherwise, usually, IMO rogue is a better pick in such situations.

Hmmm, well, true, the DC will be crap unless you take a good amount of levels and/or high INT. I've found Assassin's II very good when I casted it while in dragon shape XD, not everyone gets in that position.
