ta, that seems sensible <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>ATM I think I've come up with a character who is going to be all around mediocre.

*sigh* well I've decided there wasn't as much synergy as I hoped for<br>ends up mediocre fighter, mediocre buffer, and due to lack of skill points not a particularly good Assassin<br>I'm beginning to see why nobody else has created a build with  this class combo <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"><br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

What if you thought about it like a shifter buils and focused on a form like tensor's transformation?  you get the + to attack.  Do the bufs stack with bulls, cats, etc?

I'm not sure how it would work with Tenser's Transformation<br>I presume the bonuses from Tensers to STR and that from Bulls Strength would stack up to +12<br>I'll keep playing around with the idea and I'm grateful for suggestions <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>I've actually got a story for this 1, just the build I'm lacking <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.
