A sinister whip build - looks good, Bromium - an evil swashbuckler/combra type, and elf -- Nice! (I like him)<br><br>Staying away from the ED debate, I'd be tempted to swap some of the stealth foci for i.e. wf/ewf unarmed or kamas (dem be some nice skills, though - Yar!, but since you're dex-based &amp; not wearing armor etc., why not be even more sinister so to speak/have the option to flurry etc. too, yes?) ~ Tyr (yar, just me eight-pieces of silver as they say <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/01/07 18:53</span></i></p>

That's a very strong build you have there. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  Not sure though, but would you consider, seeing as that build focuses mainly on sneaking, and has a pretty good AC, going Human instead and gaining 80 more HP? It seems like it allow that build to stand toe to toe much better, considering as you wouldn't need to stay in combat for long amounts of time with HIPS.<br><br>On another note, about the 8 Assassin=HIPS, do you play on the PvP server Antiworld?

It's curious to see that some PWs ban Shadowdancers for they HiPS while others grant HiPS to Assassins for free.<br><br>Like it, seems nice (especially with HiPS), too bad you're not wearing <i>kamas</i>, but I'll let go because it's an RP world <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> .

Changed the build a bit to get whip sooner.<br><br>lvl  6:  Exotic Weapons<br>lvl  9:  Weapon Focus Whip<br>lvl 12:  Improved Crit Whip<br>lvl 15:  Blind Fight<br><br>===<br><br>This doesn't change the nature of the build, it simply allows me to use a whip a lot sooner.

Drop BG altogether.  Add 5 levels of SD and 5 levels of Assn.  End result, slightly lower AB, but you now have HiPS, Epic Dodge and +3d6 sneak dice.  Oh, and more skills.  Might have to drop a feat here or there for Dodge and Mobility, but no biggie.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

What I find humurous (and this may just be because I am used to playing tabletop) is that the assassin actually does get HIPS in tabletop.  *shrugs* can't imagine why he/she shouldn't get it on here too.<br><br>Seraph
