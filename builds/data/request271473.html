Hey all.  Long time listener, 2nd time caller.<br><br>I have a request for some general opinions about what builds that the esteemed panel would recomend.  I just have a few requests.<br><br>1. 12 Bard levels before Level 16.<br>2. Ability to use Level 4 Bard spells by the 10th Level of Bard.<br>3. Final UMD (with base Charisma and song) to be Level 40.<br>4. PvM with an occasional PvP on request<br><br>That's it.  Strength or Dexterity based do not matter to me.  For reference let's say +5 is tops for magic items, and no perma-haste.  What I am looking for is this, given these requirements and limitations, what would you typically build?

With those parameters, I would lean towards a split of either 20, 23 or 26 Bard levels. 26 preferred to be undispellable, except by MD, and to qualify for two extra feats.<br><br>Most often going 16 Bard pre-epic so that Lasting Inspiration is available as soon as possible in the epic progression (earliest is at 20th Bard level).<br><br>As far as race goes, most often it would have to be human, but half-elf at a push.<br><br>Usually STR based, rather than DEX.<br><br>The remaining pre-epic classes would tend to be full BAB, most likely Fighter, to get access to Heavy Armor Proficiency, Martial Weapons, Weapon spec and some extra much needed feats.<br><br>The third class I would not mix in until epic levels, mainly to preserve BAB as much as possible. This would generally be any of RDD, CoT, BG, SD (if DEX based), WM, HS or PM, taking 10 levels of each. BG &amp; HS would be the exceptions to this as 3 or 4 would probably suffice to open up the possibility of using the Divine Feats and the 1d6 Sneak Attack at 4th; HS well, there's only 5 levels to take, but allows you to up your CHA, or increase skills such as Taunt, Discipline, Concentration with ESF feats.<br><br>Feats:<br><br>Lingering Song<br>Curse Song<br>Extend Spell<br>Still Spell<br>Weapon Focus<br>Blind Fight<br>Toughness<br>Knockdown/ Improved Knockdown<br>Improved Critical<br>Power Attack<br>Cleave<br>Great Cleave (only if going Dev Crit)<br>Epic Weapon Focus<br>Epic Prowess<br>Armor Skin<br>Great STRs<br>Epic Skill Focus: Taunt<br>Epic Skill Focus: Discipline<br>Epic Skill Focus: Perform<br>Overwhelming Crit (only if going Dev Crit)<br>Dev Crit (see above)<br><br>Skills:<br><br>Concentration<br>Discipline<br>Perform<br>Spellcraft<br>Tumble<br>Taunt<br>UMD<br>(1 rank in each of Open Lock, Search, Disable Trap, Lore)<br><br>Your base unbuffed AB would be about 40 or so, depending on your stat split - mine most often being:<br><br>STR 16<br>DEX 8<br>CON 14<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 15<br><br>I generally go the PvM route, but I daresay these parameters may make them perform quite well in PvP. <br><br>*****************************<br><br>Here's a few from my past:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "212945", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Taloned Wandering Minstrel (Bard 26 / FTR 4 / RDD 10)</a><br>-- I...Samphus<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "220720", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Wailing Whiplash (Bard 23 / COT 10 / WM 7)</a><br>-- I...Samphus<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "237619", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Guardian Angel (Bard 25 / COT 10 / HS 5)</a><br>-- I...Samphus<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "242348", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Ode to a Lily (Bard 26 / FTR 4 / COT 10)</a><br>-- I...Samphus<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "253927", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Angel of Redemption (Bard 26 / BG 4 / COT 10)</a><br>-- I...Samphus<br><br>Hopefully they may give you some ideas.

Bard is one of the most flexible classes. (Do a search with only Bard 1-40 specified  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  )<br><br>For melee I like Bard 16/Blackguard 4 pre epic. In epic I add 10 lvls of RDD and Bard, for Bard 26/Blackguard 4 /RDD 10. Other options are Bard 26/Blackguard 4/Palemaster 10 or Bard 20/Blackguard 4/ Palemaster 16 (for epic spells and better AC). With Cha enhancing equipment you can add substantial divine damage to your attack with Divine Might, and get a nice boost to your saves.<br><br>Another option is a ranged attacker combining Bard with AA. The choice of a third class is wide open here.<br><br>A completely different power build is combining Cleric and Bard for double cheesy goodness. Add any other class to your taste. <br>Do a search and get the feel for what these builds have to offer.<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan

Can you change alignments? Bard/Paladin/RDD is the best there is <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   If not, sub BG over Paladin, the only thing you lose is one feat (ok you lose Remove Disease, Immunity to Fear etc but they're quite trivial <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">  ).<br>_________________<br>" -- They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then it's night once more."<br><br> - Pozzo in Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 04/18/07 15:40</span></i></p>

I'd also take a look at Kail's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "253956", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Mourning Glory</a>, which is an AC tank that gets Lasting.  It hits Bard 16 early, but puts off later bard levels for a skill dump, so it might not be ideal if you want to be relying on your song while leveling in epic.

I was hoping that someone might be able to list the bard song and curse song bonus after lvl 20. How many lvl in bard and skill points in performance are needed, to get what.
