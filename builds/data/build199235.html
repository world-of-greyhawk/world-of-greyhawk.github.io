That last level of druid doesn't really give you anything.  An additional level of bard at the very end would let you max tumble for +8 AC.  If I've counted correctly, you get 92 skill points in total (which is impressively low by the way, <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> ), which would be enough for 41 ranks in spellcraft (going to 43 is unnecessary with only 8 INT), 8 lore, 40 tumble, and have a whopping 3 extra points to spend wherever your heart desires.  You wouldn't have enough to sink into perform of course, but I think the +8 AC is more useful anyway.<br><br>Steve

Thanks for the input! I originally thought of Bard at last level but then left it out because i forgot about tumble! Also, that is a lot of damage reduction, has anyone ever made a build of dragon/dwarven defender and got damage reduction III...?

Why 27 strength?<br>I would drop starting strengh to 17, freeing up 5 points that can be spent on constitution for more hitpoints in human form or int for more skill points. You still have 25 str well before you can take overwhelming and devastating critical and you will probably change into dragon form before doing any melee fighting anyway.

Erm...<br><br>I made a not entirely dissimilar build a few months ago, similarily with the target of dev crit in dragon shape.  Unless something has changed recently dev crit unarmed strike doesn't carry over into shifted forms, since these forms actually use a creature weapon, so you would require the feat "devasting critical creature weapon", which is possible with the PRC, but not in NWN.

Well, I think that you can make a dev critting dragon with the prc, there are a couple of builds on the forum that do that.  Or you could modify the shifter scripts that you have running.
