Stalking, Hunting, Slashing &amp; Trapping PvP and (1-40) PvM<br><br>Knight Panther (Warrior of the Cats)<br>By Deborah "Tyr" Templar<br><br>Concept: The Knight Panther is a stealth warrior from a sacred race, known as the Cat People, who were born of a time when humans sacrificed their children to the Black Leopards; food for the immortal cats. Some of these children were spared, to be raised by the cat gods as their own; and when these human-cubs matured, some even mated with them. It is from this strange yet powerful lineage that the Cat People were born. At one time worshipped like the great cats from which they sprang, this noble race of warriors – half-cat, half-human – are a people that time forgot, their existence relegated to myth. But they are no myth; they continue to roam the land, in search of their pray, their favored enemies whom they stalk with great stealth and precision. Laying patiently in wait, yet at all times ready to strike, so skillfully do they set their deadly traps; no pity for their victim, such a poor, pitiful creature; oblivious are they all to the danger until it is too late (inspired somewhat by the film, entitled: “Cat People” (a classic that was shot in 1942, with a remake filmed in 1982). <br><br>Strengths &amp; Weaknesses:<br>Seven (7) Favored Enemies: ALL PCs covered and accounted for!<br>Very High AB and Lethal Damage Potential, including 6d6 Sneak and 6+2d6 Bane damage (there being no immunity to bane), Deadly Trap Skills (bolstered by “Take 20” – i.e., sufficient retries to obtain maximum possible skills check, even when in combat), and a loyal panther by his/her side (complementary stealth, spot/listen, and 13d6 sneak!).  While AC is decent (with the ability also, if not dual-wielding or trap setting, wear full plate and/or equip tower shield as necessary), and HPs are, too, saves could definitely be better (although, has uncanny, evasion and, among others, resist elements spell); saves are, however, “savable” by BG Dark Blessing (enhance w. charisma), and UMD skills (being optimized). Stealth has also been optimized.<br><br>While not the first of his/her kind in terms of the class combo, (there being one other on the pulse, entitled: "Malar’s Champion /Ranger 21/Blackguard 16/Rogue 3" by coreyb,  <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "229882", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> , which is a (cool) BG-heavy build, and thus a different character than is this one (being more heavy on ranger &amp; rogue for full-access to ranger spells, skills (i.e.,  stealth, traps), among other differences).

I must ask. Please tell me why BG, and what does it really bring into the build except a short-duration, stacking Bull's? Nothing wrong, just wondering.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

Why BG - great question. Apart and aside from theme/alignment, there be many factors, like: poison, +1 hard boost all saves (Dark Blessing, which enables us to further boost all saves another +6 (cap cha); 'tis a beautiful thing and, unlike cot sacred defense, doesn't count toward +20 saving throw cap <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">        <br><br>Aside from all that, we also gets us the ability to wear plate (I don't personally recommend it, since can't dual-wield in plate, and would penalize stealth &amp; traps, but still, some want this option (and never know, if only to have it on a "just in case" basis in inventory, could at some point come in handy, ya know <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>Also, a 1d6 sneak (not a lot, but stacks with rogue's (bg also having better hps than rogue, the latter not coming with dark blessing); there also be bull's as you say which, at 4 hours duration, isn't really that short, and besides, we gets it pre-ep when it'll do us the most good (w.o losing any ab); bg bull's also stacks with other sources. While a nice bonus, it's not the main reason: dark blessing simply just too good not to take here.<br><br>Also, for those who may want, w. BG can pick up taunt, the BG being one of the few classes who can train in this (although I highly recommend sticking with those deadly trap skills I put in (reason of course why I sets out that damage and took skill mastery, but there be some H/S players out there who no doubt prefer the +6 ab boost (so far as it reduces enemy ac) as opposed to taking the time to set traps (and since taunt would come with a +6 skill boost (since all PCs are FEs), it be a viable option); being able to summon a ghast, that's not too shabby either: just a bonus it is, but a nice minute distraction for our cover/flank, then rip in along with our panther (sounds BG to me, doesn't it to you?!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">       <br><br>Appreciate the question, Grim, I do and your comments, too, Dealer - thanks!!
