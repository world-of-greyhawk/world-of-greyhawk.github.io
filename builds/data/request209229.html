Anyone got a good cleric/monk build? Has to be able to survive in a low magic world without kamas or dev crit.<br><br>Was looking to be more monk than cleric, not sure what the 3rd class should be. <br><br>Thanks

I like the Shadow Cleric by Zhoreb. He ends up Monk 20/Cleric 15/SD 5.<br><br>Cut and pasted because I'm not the best with links <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>If you're looking for a PvP champ...you'd better skip to another topic. But none the less, I really enjoy playing this character.<br><br>He's fast, he's agile, he can Hide in Plain Sight and his ability to Dodge is of Epic proportions. With Cleric Buffs he can even deal a fair amount of damage using only fists and feet.<br>His tactics in combat are fairly simple:<br>(Buff buff buff)<br>sneak, knockdown, score a few hits, knockdown, score a few hits etc etc; or<br>sneak, knockdown, harm, kill; or<br>sneak, harm, kill; or<br>Prepare Silent spells, cast silence on self, and run close to magic user, or knock him down with silence on. You are faster, he won't get away. And if something does go wrong....RUN!!<br><br>This is how I plan to level the character (lvl 18 atm)<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Any Lawful<br>Domains: Any (I chose Trickery and Magic)<br>Start with these ability scores:<br>STR 10<br>DEX 16<br>CON 10<br>WIS 16<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8<br><br>Increase WIS at lvl 20 and 36.

A relatively weak melee presence, mediocre saving throws, low hp, but very versatile and sometimes lethal. With Epic Dodge, tumble and monk speed, you can leave and enter melee almost at will.<br><br>Edited By Zhoreb on 12/20/04 17:24:58<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

Thanks for the build but I can't take sd with this guy: on the pw I lay you have to take a lot of lvls of rogue just to take sd. <br><br>I was thiking a monk/cleric/ftr or cot would be cool but didn't see that one posted. I tried building one myself but came out all wrong, it was pretty weak.

Thanks Amazon, that link you sent me is pretty cool, never seen it before.<br><br>Someone gave me this guide on the server I play on but I'm not sure how to put it together.

Pre-epic feats should include power attack, divine might/shield, improved critical unarmed strike, weapon focus unarmed strike, maximize (or empower, meh) spell, extend spell, and weapon specialization unarmed strike.<br><br>In epics, take epic weapon focus unarmed strike, epic weapon specialization unarmed strike, armor skin, epic prowess, great dexterity I, and, you know, whatever else you want to throw in.<br><br>He'll pretty much dominate everything so long as he's buffed, might have to worry about rest spawns more than most melees, but in the end, you can't go wrong with a possible 78 AC, 64 AB, loads of divine damage, 8 attacks per round, cleric goodness, immunity to mind spells, super speed...definitely good stuff.

Looks ok to me but I'm no expert<br>Would it be worth swopping either Empower or Maximise for Extra Turning to give more uses of Divine Might and Shield<br><br>edit: Might be worth taking Trickery Domain instead of Healing. Improved Invisibility will be handy until you get Empty Body and put 1 into Disable Traps and Open Locks (cross-class sadly) and hes a bit of a rogue too<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Amazon Queen on 08/20/05 17:25</span></i></p>

I dunno really.. Empower does lose value with buffs after awhile since having solid +5 is better so perhaps you could swap it for Extra Turning.. how many extra does that give again anywho?<br><br>-DaMouse

Thanks DaMouse, really cool of you to make the build sheet. I'm no expert but looks good to me too. I will probally take trickery instead of healing for improv invis.<br><br>As for the extra turning, I'm really not sure yet. I guess I'll wait to hear from you and Amazon Queen.

Hmm.. yeah.. perhaps exchanging Empower Spell for Extra Turning.. since rest spawns are pretty common in a lot of higher level areas.. being able to churn out Divine Shield again is good.. I think Rocker chose Healing because it gives better healing spells on 3T and thus with your shoddy HP could heal you up again <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> . I guess it's how you wanna play.. if you wish to have 50% conceal (which I would) and have less healing potential then I say go for it! Healing is only useful if you get hit <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-DaMouse
