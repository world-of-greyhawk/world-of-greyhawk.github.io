People are going to have a field day with another "best build" request. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  But I suggest a Weapon Master of some sort. I'm addicted to builds with a handful of rogue levels. How about Fighter 8/Rogue 10/WM 22? Get crippling strike and Epic Weapon Specialization. Take the last Rogue level at 37 to get Tumble and UMD to 40. Pump up STR real high. You'll be able to get an unbuffed AB of 50 or so. You could also do Fighter 12/DD 21/WM 7. DR makes up for lack of AC. Get CON to 22 and get EDR and a bucket of HP, EWS again.

Smiters sure make the strongest critical hits, but they're so unreliable "best" is a very inaccurate way to describe them.<br><br>Oh well, "best" is such a problematic description anyway, whirlin_merlin suggested a high Dwarven Defender there, a build I like a lot for being resistant and strong but it's hardly best in terms of damage output, so, to hell, I don't know what to suggest because my "best" works for "strong fun to play", not for "ultra uber killing machine", which dosn't exist.<br><br>You don't even have to go Weapon Master, build up a Fighter/Cleric and give him a Scythe. The build rocks, good stats overall, so the scythe won't make it any worse anyways.<br><br>If you want style then take Blackguard, it's the class I'd use to RP a scythe.<br><br>Or heck, Red Dragon Disciple / Bard / High BAB class, you don't have to take Dev Crit just because your STr score meets the requisites. Since it's banned then just take more Strength instead.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
