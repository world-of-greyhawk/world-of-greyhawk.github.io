Heya!<br><br>I am looking for a decent wizard / PM build mainly because the server on which I play the saves are extremely messed up.. So I was thinking.. Evocation? mainly for Bigby and IGMS seeing as that's the only thing that works. And possibly sitll, silent, max and empowered spell to get my IGMS as well as time stop arsenal as high as possible. Basically I want my build to be as cheesy as it can get for that's what everyone else does. I chose PM because I looked at the feats it gives..quite nice.. immune to dev crit is always good <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

I mean the fortitude easily passes the 60 boarder which kind of removes the idea of going for necromancy for example.

Why bother playing a spellcaster at all if the saves are that ridiculously high? It seems to me that spellcasting is completely useless on the server. That being said, is AC a big concern? If so, go with more than 10 PM levels. You don't really need more than 25 or 26 WIZ levels (this will ensure you can't be Dispelled).<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...
