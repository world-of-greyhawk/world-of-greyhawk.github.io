Corellon's Chanteuse<br>Elven <br>(Female - Leyrana Ma'fer)<br>(Bard 12, Champion Of Torm 10, Arcane Archer 18)<br>Lawful Neutral<br>PvM (No idea about PvP)<br><br>Thought I had found a new concept for a class mix, but sadly I have beaten to the punch by Jennalee <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br>Jennalee's Singer of Blade and Bow<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "217727", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>However, my take on this, whilst it does have a similar level split is a Dex based version, which focuses more on the ranged attack. The result is a higher melee and ranged AB, albeit with less damage. The overall effect is an archer with pretty decent saves that can go toe to toe if required - although with an elf's constitution that isn't that wise for long. <br><br>For those of you with an rp bent, in my personal experience this has been a wonderful character to play, the all-round capability of this character has been immense. <br><br>However, in playability terms, there are four minor gripes that you need to work around.<br><br>No Evasion/ Imp. Evasion - which is a shame with such a high base Reflex save (40, 49 with Spellcraft)<br>No Uncanny Dodge - you can opt to wear Medium Armor if you are not bothered about the loss of Dex Modifier AC, but it is up to you. Don't forget she can go rapier and board as well.<br>Hitpoints - A shame really, but elves are not the stoutest of folk after all<br>Chance of Spellcasting Failure - dependent on armor worn<br><br>Still you can't have everything.. pity really.

Playabilty and a decent defense was key in my mind, hence the reason taking Epic Will, Epic Fortitude and Curse Song so early in the progression. Epic Prowess was taken first to balance overall AB between melee and ranged. <br><br>Here goes folks... see what you think.

Well, I think the build is well done. It's a pity EWF come so late. <br>Actually, I understand why you spread bard lvls, but not why you spread CoT. Bard already has discipline as a class skill, so you could get all the CoT lvls much sooner and therefore the bonus feats and saves boni. Epic weapon Foci could come sooner that way. Just a thought.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Nice build.<br><br>Can't be lawful though.  Other than that I can't see any obvious way to improve it.

Thanks!<br><br>I agree with you on EWF, but I tried to balance out the progression of both melee and ranged (for playability purposes), hence EP earlier than either of the two EWFs.<br><br>CoT was spread out in epic levels to try to balance out the save progression, skill dumps into Discipline and the Epic Feat Selection to tie up with the AB progression in ranged and melee (as mentioned).<br><br>This could be improved on certainly to maximise the playability in epic levels, but I need time to do that... maybe one day.<br><br>Cheers
