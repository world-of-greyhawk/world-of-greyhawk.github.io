I want to do a ranger on a low magic items server<br><br>Mainly dmg is the great power of low magic servers so Bane of enemies is of course needed and lots og favored enemies, because the dangers will be many and fierce.<br><br>So lots of FE's, either sneak dmg(dexer) or FTR dmg(STR).<br>Dont like casting so any dmg from spells....no chance<br><br>Also it's preferable with either Elf, human or dwarf as a race. <br><br>Any ideas would be wonderful and remember it is low magic so it's essential that i have both HP and DMG. That is why im leaning towards a sort of sneaker because i wouldn't rely too much on HPs then.<br><br>But anyhow...! Need help on this one <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kalmar_Oxin on 01/24/05 19:12</span></i></p>

Rogue 13/Ranger 21/Fighter 6.  Bane of Enemies, 7d6 sneaks, and Epic Weapon Spec mean you should be able to do some serious damage.  Feel free to go either Dex or Str-based, whichever you prefer.  If you go Str-based, you will probably want Improved Evasion, and you course Crippling Strike is always fun as it will weaken your opponent every time you make a successful sneak attack.
