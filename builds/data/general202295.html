Hi all,<br>I had the thought of making a Wilderness hunter type build. Since I haven't ever played a shifter, I figured let's throw that in. I was going for a roleplay of a hunter who has learned to Mimick his prey to get in close etc. There are animals in nature that mimick other animals etc. I wanted some trapping skills to try playing the game using trapping as a tactic. Also I wanted to go for Bane of enemies. I felt Kobold commando would be a good shape to hunt / stalk in with other forms for different situations. Anyway here's what I built.<br><br>The Mimicking Hunter : Ranger 21 / Druid 6 / Shifter 13<br>Race Human<br><br>Alignment Any Neutral<br><br>Base Attrib(end stats)    <br>STR 14 (17)<br>DEX 14<br>CON

I'm interested in any feedback or suggestions on improving the build, or tightening it up leveling selection / feat selection wise. I would have liked to get epic humanoid shape for epic Kobold and drow, but it needs 15 shifter and no way to do that and get bane of enemies. I'm not sure if bane is worth more than epic humanoid though. There are many other shapes etc you can use. I also wanted to stay on focus of a hunter / ranger type and so didn't go all out wisdom and gimp all other stats to go for Dragonshape. I increased const to get the epic dr feats as con isn't overwritten on many of the forms including Kobold. Anyway please tell me what you think. Also this is meant to be played from level 1 to 40 pvm in the oc's or any module or Pw and so not a straight to 40 built build.<br><br><br>                       Thanks, Mano<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick.

Improved humanoid shapes actually come on shifter level 17, which totally removes the possibility of BoE since shifter 17 requires 22 levels (5 druid and 17 shifter), so your existing level distribution (or similar) is probably the only way to get BoE.<br><br>I think I'll have a quick play around with this concept though, it seems an intresting one.<br><br><br>Taking a second look though, it might well be possible to go in a high wisdom direction and pick up undead, outsider and construct shape feats though.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By M1ke47 on 07/02/05 10:06</span></i></p>

Nice Mike!!<br><br>   That's a pretty cool way of doing the build. You do get outsider which is cool the Rak form and it's ice storms etc. I just hate having wisdom that high and it not doing anything else for the build. I know, that's why everyone throws in monk for the ac bonus to at least get something for all the wisdom. I guess if going this way should just drop BoE and take more druid to use the wisdom for spells. That would at least use the wisdom.<br><br>   I like the different feats you took than my build though. I know they will help with him fighting in his rissen lord and kobold shape. I like those changes. Also you changed leveling order. Did that give a better base attack, or was it for different feat reasons in epic?<br><br>    Thanks again for discussing the build idea with me as that's why I posted it.<br><br>              Thanks, Mano<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick.

Well, aside from taking 20 pre epic ranger levels (or similar), the AB is about as good as it will be.  And the leveling order is mostly arranged to achieve feats at certain levels.  As I said before its quite "rough" and can be "min/maxed" further.

Looks cute<br><br>You could drop one of the late druid levels however and exchange for a tenth ranger level to get epic prowess from the favoured enemy feat though.

I wouldn't bother with the ice storm. At lvl 14 it does 9d6 damage, it means ~31 average damage, empowered ~46. Not too sexy for a lvl40. You will certainly do more damage with your staff.<br><br>But don't overlook the outsider forms, the Rhakasha is a killer with his immunities and staff. And against heavy potions user, his dispel might even be of use.<br><br>aquamoeba
