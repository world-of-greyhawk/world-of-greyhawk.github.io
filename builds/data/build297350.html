Here's my second build on here <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">  <br>The aim was to create a build that could tank in a group, but deal enough damage when alone.

Strength domain is strong (no pun intended) in a melee build with few cleric lvls since you can get Divine power in both lvl 3 and 4 spellslots, and extended in the lvl 4 and 5 slots.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

Animal could work too, if you're gonna use bard spells for summoning.   True Seeing at third level is pretty sweet.  Strength would add Stone Skin too.<br><br>Given that this is partly for party play, it seems a shame not to get seventh level slots and resurrection.  I guess you didn't want to raise WIS any higher, but still seems a shame.

Yup, domains also can depend on the server so I guess it varies for which ones you should choose.<br><br>I thought I could go with 17 Cleric/17 Bard, but the build sort of relies on its charisma for Divine Might/Shield, it would be inconvenient to lose more for wisdom. Also, lasting inspiration is nice to have.<br><br>And if you really have to, I thought you could just scroll those sort of higher level cleric spells.

I would suggest Bard 21/Cleric 13/CoT 6. Gets you level 7 Cleric spells, still gets Lasting Inspiration. I would also only take 3 CoT levels pre-epic (leave BAB at 15 to get the best use of DP), and use the CoT Bonus feat at level 4 for another Great Wis (bring Wis to 17 for level 7 spells).<br><br>Last, I would be tempted to lower Cha somewhat for some more Str. Yes, you can do lots of divine damage via DM, but you have a rather low AB. Boosting Str means less AC from Divine Shield, but the damage from DM gets replaced by physical damage from Str, so no loss there, and it adds to your AB. I would probably aim for something like Cha 20 and Str 24 - leaves Cha high enough to make DS and DM useful (+5 unbuffed, +11 buffed), but gains you 5 to AB all the time.<br><br>TM
