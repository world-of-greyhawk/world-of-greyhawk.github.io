This build is intended to correct my previous mistakes with the Versatile Archer build, for example SR was taken out after I realized I was using the wrong math for it and that Mordekainen's Disjunction lowers it by 10.<br>It's possible my end stats will be slightly off, because I'm not actually test building this character, I'm just making a few minor tweaks in text, but they should be correct or at least very close.<br><br>Years of monastic devotion coupled with rigorous arcane studies have molded this surprisingly versatile archer. He not only boasts a vicious arrow, but can easily confound all but the most powerful spellcasters with his beefy magical defenses, and can avoid melee battle with his tremendous speed. His greatest weakness, ironically, is to his fellow archer, but even there he can often shine with the aid of highly accurate crippling arrows. He doesn't find it dishonorable to stay out of the reaches of danger, as long as he doesn't flee battle entirely.<br><br>Starting Stats (Ending Stats)<br>STR 10<br>DEX 20 (30)<br>CON 13 (14)<br>WIS 8<br>INT 12<br>CHA 8<br><br>1 Monk-Point Blank Shot<br>2 Monk-<br>3 Monk-Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>4 Monk-<br>5 Monk-<br>6 Monk-Toughness<br>7 Monk-<br>8 Monk-<br>9 Wizard-Rapid Shot<br>10 Arcane Archer-<br>11 Arcane Archer-<br>12 Arcane Archer-Improved Critical: Longbow<br>13 Arcane Archer-<br>14 Arcane Archer-<br>15 Arcane Archer-Blindfight<br>16 Arcane Archer-<br>17 Arcane Archer-<br>18 Arcane Archer-Called Shot<br>19 Arcane Archer-<br>20 Monk-<br>21 Arcane Archer-Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>22 Arcane Archer-<br>23 Arcane Archer-<br>24 Arcane Archer-Armor Skin, Epic Prowess<br>25 Arcane Archer-<br>26 Arcane Archer-<br>27 Arcane Archer-Epic Fortitude<br>28 Arcane Archer-Great Dexterity I<br>29 Arcane Archer-<br>30 Monk-21+ Discipline, Epic Skill Focus: Discipline<br>31 Monk-<br>32 Monk-<br>33 Monk-Epic Will<br>34 Arcane Archer-<br>35 Arcane Archer-<br>36 Arcane Archer-Epic Reflexes<br>37 Monk-Max Tumble<br>38 Wizard-40 Spellcraft<br>39 Arcane Archer-Epic Energy Resistance: Fire<br>40 Monk-Max Discipline<br>If you used your skills for 40 Spellcraft, 40 Tumble and 43 Discipline, you have another 86 skill points to distribute.

(More damage output)<br><br>Pros:<br>Moderate HP for an archer.<br>Nice naked AC.<br>Better AB than at least 95% of melee characters (not including short-term buffs), with the ability to stay out of range due to monk speed.<br>Nice Fortitude and Reflex saves, moderate will saves.<br>Improved Evasion.<br>Some Spell Resistance (25)<br>+50% Monk Speed<br>Decent damage output. With strength boosting equipment and a mighty weapon, even better.<br>10/- fire resistance.. Helps against Fire Arrow and Flame Weapon/Darkfire.<br><br>Cons:<br>While HP is good for an archer, it is still pretty low. But as outlined above, the various defensive capabilities of this build compensate for this very well. Nonetheless IGMS can be a real threat (although you may be able to run out of range of this... I’ve never had a chance to try it, but i somehow doubt it.). (Note that even with +4 con you can only soak up 2 max IGMS)<br>Damage output isn’t as high as some archers, and AC isn’t good enough to stop other archers. An archer with high discipline (can’t use called shot) and damage output would be a very challenging, if not devastating, foe.<br>Not immune to death magic/abilities.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/10/07 13:21</span></i></p>

One thing I neglected with that build, because I didnt actually test it, is the extra feat due to taking four more AA levels. You could take Great Dexterity or Epic Toughness. If you take Great Dex, you'll want to take another one, meaning you could drop Epic Reflexes, Epic Will, or Epic Energy Res: Fire. My vote would be for fire, considering with 38 reflexes, 40 spellcraft and improved evasion, along with the fact that you can stay out of range of melee fighters with darkfire/flame weapon, you won't really need it that much. So your ab and ac can each be one point higher. Yay.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?
