Well despite playing this game for many many hours and years ive never reallyu been able to make a good build.Good charas i thinks so but the study of arcane levels and feats  well beyond me i suppose and the way i play which is casual just logging on for an hour or so to relax between my house chores.<br> The unfortunate side of this is I run into these critters that want to light me up with  missiles like a christmas tree turn me into a porcupine  with arrows..or simply show how they can decapitate me in one blow.<br><br>  Thats not a problem  but I would like to live long enough to type  more than a few choice insults aboout there banality lack of manners etc etc....and as have to think in English and type  looking at keyboard  takes quite a while to types.....<br><br>  So my request a build doesnt have to kill just survive the arrows the scythe ...always thought they should be class limited to farmers and the bored magees...Ahh you say but if not kill how get levels ...well usually if you funny play the game DM do tend to rewards me...<br><br><br>  So can anyone give me ideas for a **Survivor** with a very very bad turn mouth..............

You could try a cha and con based bard 30/pm 10 with 21 con + however much cha you can fit in. Also take epic damage reduction and take some energy energy resistance. Should make you very difficult to kill if you also take full ranks in the heal skill, and most people would be reluctant to attack you in the middle of a group fight unless they can self silence or dispel your wounding whispers sonic damage.

When it comes to a survivor, or the last-man-standing character, I always go with some combination of Rogue/Ftr/CoT.  Do a Guild search for those specific classes and see what you come up with.  Xitooner's Martial Rogue is quite good, and I would throw the Incredible Fighting Rogue of War up there with it.  My personal favorite in late pre-epic to Epic is <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "213875", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Death's Rival</a>, as well as the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "213875", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Last Great Bounty Hunter</a>.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

A build I use that is good for survivability is Cleric/DD and preferably some CoT in there to. It survives from good hp, DR and the cleric abilities to heal and buff.
