How do you search on Guild formums?  Can you even search the forum?

Not sure if you can search, but if you want to check out the builds there is a link to an indexed list at the top of the page that lists all the builds in the guild in alphabetical order by the username of their creators.

I saw that there.. the problem is that I know what classes I want to build; but I need a plan for it... how do I search for these builds?

Generally best to choose the least popular class in your build to narrow it down more.  ie if you are looking for monk/wiz/pm do find on "pm".

I love this toolbar for that feature alone. it opens a little navigation window that shows a mini version of the web page you're looking at. Any incidences of that word are indicated by a yellow dot on the navigation window. Clicking on a yellow dot moves the full web page down to the location of that entry. So you can quickly leap down the page (because all entries now have the classes &amp; levels in their titles), scanning the matching builds. If you see any that interest you, simply click on the title and the build opens in a new browser window. This allows you to continue down the Highlight navigation frame. Unfortunately, I often end up with 8 or 10 other browser windows, each containing a unique build to review.<br><br>If you don't have the MSN toolbar/don't want it/don't use IE, etc, then the old fashioned way is to go to the Indexed List of Builds, hit Ctrl-F, type in the class you're looking for ("PM"), hit Enter, and keep doing that down the web page. If you see a build that interests you, click to open it in a new window. Then restart your CTRL-F search again.<br><br>I hope this helps. If I wasn't clear enough let me know. <br><br>Kaliban
