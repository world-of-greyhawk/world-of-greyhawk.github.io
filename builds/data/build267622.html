I like the concept, but maybe move Bane of Enemies to level 40 Ranger bonus feat, and drop epic prowess for armor skin?<br><br>All in all, a nice build, to be certain..

He needs AB more than he needs AC, IMO, so better leave EP in there. I notice you say PvP40, and that is probably right, since levelling a dex-ranger is a pain. Stealth-based builds with ranger included truly will be hard to find.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Wow, nice to see these things debated and resolved before you even know they are a problem. <br><br>Yes, this one has Epic Dodge and HiPS for defense, so AB is the focus.  <br><br>Ranger gets the full AB progression and Bane of Enemies, which is particularly nice for a dexer (extra AB and damage).   <br><br>Cheers, all, and thanks, Grim.<br><br>Ithacan<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Ithacan on 03/05/07 20:50</span></i></p>

Someone mentioned Ranger26/Monk9 split, but you might get the best of both worlds with Ranger25/Monk10.  Get the +1Monk AC and a Ranger Bonus Feat.
