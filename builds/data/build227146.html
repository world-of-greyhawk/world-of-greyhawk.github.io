Mystra's Bow<br><br>Concept:  Make an Arcane Archer with lots of Cleric levels, focus solely on wisdom, and get Zen Archery.

You might look at:  Cleric of the Bow (Cleric 20 / Wizard 1 / AA 19) <br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "212319", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Might help your build some.  For example, why have 10 CHA when you aren't using any CHA in your build?  Drop it to 8 and add it to something that can help the build more.<br><br>Personally, I don't know why anyone would make this char with WIZ instead of BARD.  Bard allows UMD and Tumble, though it does take two levels of bard instead of one Wiz.  My favorite AA build is Charismatic Divine Archer (bard 3/cleric 16/arcane archer 21)<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "224527", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Which you can easily add more cleric levels for more spells.<br><br>-pc

try to fit normal , greater and epic spell focus evocation in ... wis based without using implosion is a waste <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>you could drop cc and icc for those feats ... due to the fact you use a bow you cant use imp exp while casting so you can cast while using def casting mode <br><br>and take only 2 bard to get a cleric bonus feat more , you get nuthin from 3 bard except a few skill points more .<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By bloodymerc on 01/17/06 10:34</span></i></p>

AA used to require 2 BARD and for some reason it'll let you do it with only 1 now.  I've continued to use 2 just in case bioware 'fixes' this again.<br><br>Having the third bard level around 37-40 is good for maxing tumble.<br><br>Any cleric over 20 is probably a waste.  Your spell DC's are going to be lower than most clerics so I'd try to make your char the best it can be at what it is.  I see it is a powerful archer that can buff/heal/raise.  I'd drop the 21,22 cleric and add two AA level's for more archer power.<br><br>I'd drop your CHA to 8 and increase your WIS.  Drop CC and ICC since you are in the back plinking arrows for the most part.  Plus you can always switch to def casting mode for making a heal/raise stick.  I'd add blindfight and Great Wis for a total of 32 WIS.  (bard spells don't help the build one bit)  I'd probably drop two of the great wis for Extend Spell(for ext divine power) and Still Spell(for stilled mass heals).<br><br>-pc

cleric lvls over 20 make your spells last longer and you will be harder to dispell <br><br>blind fight is a must , forgot to mention to it <br><br>with wis  30 and +12 from items ( i ve never seen a server where you were not able to max out at least one ability ) and epic sf evocation your implosion dc will be 44 and most crit immune and /or death magic immune creatures have really low fort saves <br><br>dont forget your sof dc will be 40 and your hammer of gods will be 35 what is pretty good against fighter types , blade barrier is nice as well .

Why focus in divination... drop that and use it towards epic evo focus.  Epic evo focus is a must for PvM [where you're mainly going to excel with this build, you could also do well in PvP party battles as a combat medic].<br><br>SR will be your problem though, as highlighted.  I know of worlds where you will need at least 25 spell penetration points to get through mid-epic mobs.<br>Drop the two reflex improvement feats.. you're not going to need them.  Get in at least Greater spell penetration; that way you can punch through at least SR29 (roll of 1 does not autofail for SR checks afaik); which is about 3 below the max you can put on an item, so at worst you will rely on rolls of 4 to punch through well-equipped builds [yes monks get more, but hey you got some truly nasty buff spells in that case].<br><br>All in all a really interesting build.  I really would consider dropping 5 AA levels though, and getting in more cleric for the bonus wis feat, but then that's just the spell chucker inside o' me speakin <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> .
