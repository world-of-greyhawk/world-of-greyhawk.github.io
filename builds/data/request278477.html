I'm looking for a build that would suit something called a Thief Catcher or Thief Taker in a series of books <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  They are basically the bounty hunters of the world. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Now, traditionally, Thief Catchers would use Quarter Staffs and Sword Breakers to disarm their opponents, so that they would be able to apprehend them without causing serious injury. They are also quite good with throwing weapons from my understanding aswell. And as they say, it takes a thief to catch a thief, so many Thief Catchers are dexterous with decent sneaking capabilities. <br><br>I would like to see if someone could make me a build that fits this description, or get similar to it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Good luck!

No one even wants to TRY to make a dexer that uses a quarterstaff with lots of rogue levels for hide/ms, sneak attack and set trap or something of the sort?

I have played this PC before; I just used a straight up rogue assassin; and focused in the whip.  Easier ( since the staff cannot be finessed) and still very "true" to R.J's vision <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>The assassin levels give you death attack; which fits nicely in with the thief taker's job of capturing.<br>_________________<br>-4SakN<br><i>"never kiss a girl whose brothers have knife scars." <br>"never gamble without knowing a back way out."</i><br>-Robert Jordan
