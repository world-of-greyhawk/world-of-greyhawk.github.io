Is the sorcerer level just for boss fights PvM? I think you can find better use of the last class. If you up the paladin by just one level you'll have 1 higher GWM and Divine Favor.  And the paladin has good CHA buffs too, so if you time those in with your one use of Divine Wrath you'll have CHA 30, no worries.<br><br>And test it, I might be confused by playing NwN2, but didn't they add Arcane failure to Truestrike in the last patch? Not sure, test it.<br><br>*edit* Smite stacks with Truestrike btw, actually with everything.

I tested grimmir, and true strike don´t have pennalties due to armor. The sorcerer level is just for true strike, ´cause is usefull in the server I play (stack with everything), but this level of sorcerer can be changed for one level of paladin without problems, the best choice if you´ll play in a place where true strike doesn´t stack.

The problem you're having Grimnir, may be in the character's title itself, "High AB Paladin," which is something of a misnomer, since he really doesn't get an AB higher than most other Paladin types.  Also, not getting to Paladin 15 actually keeps him from getting a maximum Divine Favor, which was, I think, one of the thrusts of the build.  <br><br>What will stack, and also makes Truestrike supefluous, is Divine Wrath, Divine Favor and GMW.  Assuming he had Paladin 15, when he turned on Wrath he could gain an instant +21 to AB.  Of course he would cap at +20, and then add more by using a Smite.  But with a just a raw Charisma of 18, his Smite, while good, is still well below the "High-AB" smiting Paladins.  <br><br>Still, nice work, though as others said, the 1 Sorcerer is worth less than Paladin15.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

It's not that True Strike does not stack with other types of AB bonuses, rather the game caps bonus AB at +20, and since True Strike gives +20, there's no possibility of it stacking.

My 2 cents... I was obsessed with making a 30 Cot and it worked out rather well, higher ab than what is stated here. Based on my logs, I got anywhere from 71-74 AB, depending on which version I was using, (I made 5 of them on my fav-but-now-extinct server) using a +7 greatsword. <br><br>It was truly an awesome build<br><br>pal 9 COT 30 sorc 1<br><br>The way I used it, the tru strikes were for after wrath expired (assuming an enemy was still standing) to keep me from having a one and done attack.<br><br>Saves were off the charts and very nice discipline.
