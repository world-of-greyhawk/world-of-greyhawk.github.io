Hello i was hopeing someone could help me with a problem i am haveing with my new video card i had installed, Since i put this new card in and try starting NWN up all the logo's and bioware stuff pops up, but when i get to the multiplayer new game selection screen it's all black.<br><br>I looked inside my directory folder and noticed in the "nwn config" file it was still labeled as my older video card, i tried retyping in the information of my new card but still the same problem, i know its not my new card seeing it's a huge improvement from my old card, oh and toolset works also with this new card.. Can someone offer some wisdom on this please?<br><br>My apologie's if something like this was posted before i did not take the time to view older post's.

I had a similiar problem to this when I upgraded to a new graphics card my problem sorted it self out when connected it to the power supply it had an additional socket that i never noticed <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  my old card just plugged in and didnt need any extra power. Toolset would work fine but when i started the game just darkness.<br>_________________<br>Beware the beast of Caerbannogh
