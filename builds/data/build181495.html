First of all, I’ve not checked all the topics, so I don’t know if there is something similar. If so, I apologise! My idea was creating a character being capable to handle every situation, and possibly having both Dev Crit and lv 9 spells... I think this is the best I could manage to do! Ah, he is not meant for PvP.<br><br><br><br>Race: Human - Lawful good -<br>Starting stats: (Sorcerer)<br>STR 15 + 3(at level 4, 8, 40) + 8(RDD)<br>DEX 8<br>COS 14<br>WIS 10<br>INT 14<br>CHA 15 ( + 7 when levelling up) +2(RDD)<br>Familiar: Pixie<br><br>Final Stats:<br>STR 26<br>DEX 8<br>CON 16<br>WIS 10<br>INT 16<br>CHA 24<br><br>At level 20:       Sorc 6/ Pal 4/ RDD 10<br>Feats: Power attack, divine Might, divine Shield, weapon focus (scimitar), improved critical (scimitar), cleave, improved cleave, Still spell.<br>When levelling as a Paladin be sure to take divine Might &amp; Shield <br><br><br>At  level 40: Sorc 24/ Pal 6/ RDD 10<br>Feats: Epic weapon spec, Overwelming Critical, Devestating Critical, maximized spell, auto still spell 1, 2, 3, epic warding.<br><br>HP: 356 (max)<br>AB 35/30/25 (Mundane Scimitar, BUT 40/35/30 using G.M.W., which you have plenty of)<br>AC 26 (Mundare Armor, Tower shield)<br><br>Fortitude 33<br>Reflex 22<br>Will 30<br><br>Max Discipline, Concentration, Spellcraft (42-43)<br>Tumble 20, put the rest where you want...<br> <br>Must-have spell: True Strike, Flame Weapon, Eagle Splendor, Greater Magic Weapon, Haste, Keen Edge, Elemental Shield, Ice Storm, Improved Invisilibity, Bigby's Interposing Hand, Mestil's Acid Sheath, Isaac's Greater Missile Storm, Shadow Shield, True Seeing, Premonition, Time Stop, Black blade of disaster, Wail of the banshee.<br><br><br>I chose Paladin 6 instead of Sorcerer 26 for having discipline maximized, as this build is meant primarily for melee (Greater Magic Weapon, flame weapon, keen edge, divine power...), maximized spell casting is for situation in which you can swich off  the armor without risk.<br>You have a lot of immunities, and nice saves. <br>The best part of this build is that you have a lot of strategies for killing things... you can engage them in melee combat, use spell, or simply let them hit you and laugh (damage reduction and elemental/acid shield). The amount of damage for each hit is high, due to weapon enchantments and divine might, that at least last 7 rounds. You also have the possibility of use Improved invisibility with a nice AC...26 + 7div shield + 4haste = 37  + 50% concealment that grants you a nice survival rate!<br><br>AH... sorry for my English, I'm italian!

Use the index list. There is the Dragon knight posted. A very good build IMO.

Kalmar_Oxin, I've checked the list, and the more similar builds i've found are "the battle sorcerer/ess", "the trascending knight"  and the one by Swookie,since the "dragon knight" use fighter instead of paladin. Though, this build is slightlydifferent!

The problem that I see with your build is it multi-tasks too much.<br><br>It'll have a low Dev Crit DC and all spells will have low DC's.  So basically any char closer to full will beat it easily.  Plus your AB is low for a tank because of your low STR.<br><br>I have a Sorc22/Pally6/RDD10 on the world I play on.  The key spell for meleeing with him is Tensor's Transformation.  It gives you extra attacks, ab, ac, etc.  Sure my Wail DC isn't what a pure sorc or wiz can hit.  But because of my self buffs, divine might/shield, epic mage armor, epic warding, acid sheaths, elemental shields...I can tank for a long time in tensors and I can always fall back and cast whenever I want.  I didn't take DevCrit since it's been disabled on my pw.<br><br>Basically, if you are playing something like the normal campaign where the monsters have low saves, then your mage spells will still work.  But on any hard persistant world, your spells are going to be resisted easily.<br><br>And since your STR is low, your damage output is going to be lower than most tanks.<br><br>Nice try, but I doubt this char would be fun on any difficult persistant world that most of the people here play on.  And it would die quick in PvP.<br><br>-pc
