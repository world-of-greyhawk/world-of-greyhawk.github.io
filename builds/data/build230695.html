Lo all, here comes (probaly) my first ECB here on the forums, altho, iv made alot of em but posted none. Its called "Natues Blade" and is ment to be a "wise weaponmaster". cleric would rpobaly be way better for the build over all but i like the idea of having a druid weaponmaster pretty much <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  So here it is then:<br><br>The Natures Blade<br><br>The Natures Blade is a guardian of the woods, he has mastered a druid weapon and knows the most advanced druid spells. He is also a gifted fighter with fists and has mastered his senses through meditation and tough training. The Natures Blade do rarely equip anything els than just simple clothing, as something thicker would most likely reduce his flexability and skills in combat. Most of the Natures Blade warriors prefers to focus their training on using a scimitar, kama, quarterstaff or a spear and use unarmed combat as a last way out. Their combination of weapon master skills, heals, buffs and deadly spells makes them the ideal teammate for a party. Altho, their HP is not too high so they will need to heal often to keep themselfs alive. The Natures Blade warriors are always humans and are of the lawful neutral faction.<br><br>Race: Human<br>Gender: Any<br>Starting Class: Druid or Monk<br>Starting Stats:<br><br>Str:15<br>Dex:13<br>Con:10<br>Int:13<br>Wis:16<br>Cha:8<br><br>Skills to Focus in:<br><br>Animal Emphaty (AE)<br>Concentration (C)<br>Heal (H)<br>Intimidate (only 4 ranks) (I)<br>Spellcraft (SC)<br>Tumble (T)<br><br>Use the rest of the points for skills of free choice.<br><br>LVL|Class|Feats|Stats Increase|Skills Increase<br><br>1.

Well, the scimitar does a cool critical, but if you want to change the weapon I would obviously use a kama, much better than any other since you get much more attacks per round, but you wouldn't be able to use heavy armor, but that factor would apply anyway if you're not using a kama, if you use a normal armor your natural AC will lose the monk WIS AC bonus, and with that WIS AC bonus I don't think you'll be using heavy armor.<br><br>For dev crit, it's easier to use CoT or fighter for the extra feats.<br><br>It's good in general but I find the AB to be low.....

Your AB is pretty low for a weapon master. I'd say switch your Wis and Str stats, so that you end with +2AB and +2Dmg at the cost of 2AC and 2 spell DC.

Yea kama would improve the char abit with the ammount of APR, but i wanted a "blade" as main weapon in this build, and its pretty nice when u get the 12-20x3 crits with it and even better 10-20x3 with keen on it. And afterall, when u face an undead then u probaly wants to switch to unarmed strike, whitch can be used whenever u feel u need it and that gives u as many APR as kama would.<br><br>The wisdom is higher than the str cuz the build needs the extra spellslots from it, altho, 24 24 would maybe be good aswell, but the ac is better as u need it when standing in the middle of a battle casting AoE spells (all enemies will get AOO on you anyway) and the dc will as u said, be higher with more str, but i guess he will do pretty well in battle anyway.<br><br>PS: he will use robe, not heavy armor, as the monk ac bonus from the high wisdom will boost the ac alot.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By arvut on 02/18/06 00:10</span></i></p>

I still wonder why people love so much wide crit ranges. I find 17-20 to be enough and 15-20 to be plenty. The tough enemies tend to have high AC and therefore practically reduce your crit range (since you need to hit their AC in the first place), while those you easily crit against are easily dispatchable anyhow.<br>A 10-20 crit range just looks impressive, but is actually of little practical use.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Wait for me Dragon, we'll meet in the sky<br>By fire and magic, I'm sworn<br>Hell is calling, we cannot be denied<br>Fly to the blackness of the Storm<br><br>We must die to be reborn!

That critical range would be cool on, let's say, a STR based Weapon Master, but you're right, that critical range is of no use if your AB doesn't hits anyway, only the roll of 20 has an automatic hit.......

Yeah, if your AB is high you crit a lot, but I would prefer a greatsword, a keen greatsword has a cool critical range, 15-20 if I'm correct, and with the extra damage per STR modifier it gets for being a two handed weapon, you get several strong crits, a scimitrar is not a very strong weapon.<br><br>Now, if you're fighting against a Pale Master in PvP, or an undead in PvM, say goodbye to your criticals man.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/19/06 05:59</span></i></p>

Do not look at crit range alone but at your AB and at the AC of what you are going to meet. If you hit on a range, let's say, of 15-20, a crit range of 10-20 is totally useless. Those you are gonna hit on a wider range aren't probably worth the crit in the first place cause you are gonna get rid of them easily anyhow.<br><br>Besides your AB is way low, do you really think you are gonna crit on a 10-20 range?

If it's useful where you play then there's no reason to drop it for you. You probably have low AC critters there, or high AB booster gear. <br><br>In a more general sense, a huge crit range is less useful than it might seem. I wonder how would your damage output (on your server) with kamas compare to that with scimitars, considering the higher number of attacks for kama and the higher crit range for scimmy, they might end up being the same on average. If so, kama would have an edge vs crit immunes.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

it isnt always about making the best build, but also making a fun build or a build that is made for one thing. in this case, i chosed to make a druid wm with scimitar and name it "Natures Blade", it would had been better to go for 18 cleric instead and with kama(s), but the whole concept about making a Natures Blade build was to get a druid wm with scimitar. But still, feel free to change it as much as u like.
