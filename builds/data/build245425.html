The Knight Commander is Playable 1-40, PvM or PvP<br><br><br>Knight Commander (Order of the White Rose)-<br>Fighter(4), Paladin(26), Champion of Torm(10) (Revised)<br><br>By Deborah Tyr <br><br>In keeping with the medieval knight orders, in addition to the “Big-Three” (Templars, Hospitalers, &amp; Teutonic), there were numerous other little orders, such as the Thistle Knights in Scotland, and the Livonian Knights in Poland/Lithuania. This build is in keeping with the theme; players familiar with the other builds will note, however, that this is more of a power-paladin build, which has also been revised (see notes, below). I recognize that, in terms of skills, this character is a bit thin; however, it is specifically designed with a desire to achieve a good balance between its combat (melee) and smite abilities, with good hitpoints and the ability to dish out some decent damage. I hope everyone enjoys this character, as revised.

While you could technically pick up STR-bonus lost with your self-buffs (spells), the loss of your STR would nevertheless detract from the overall balance that this character was specifically designed to achieve, and reason why I stopped at Great Smite V (i.e., each smite, at up to or about 250 damage apiece, x's 3 (or, well in excess of 700 damage in total) me thinks will work out nicely for you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>True, more smites are always a valid option for high level paladins, but I like the idea that this character can follow-through with combat, without having to rely on smiting alone. This, for two reasons: first, smiting is limited in terms of daily use (or rest period) and, second, they are effective against evil beings only. While I prefer the versatility, smiting is without question a wonderful thing (except for those who be evil of course, and on the receiving end <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">       ). Thus, I put this out as an alternative, as a valid option, albeit one I wouldn't recommend.  Either way, I hope everyone enjoys this knight, or any of the others in the Templar series! ~ Tyr<br><br><i>Added EWS to damage calculation and more <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  .

Revision Notes : June 29, 2006-06-29<br><br>This character has been revised, as follows: reduced number of Fighter levels (from 6 to 4) and, in turn, raised the number of Paladin levels (from 24 to 26) for the purpose of making this character non-dispelable.  <br><br>Acknowledgments: I would like to thank Mick Dagger who brought to my attention a similar, yet different build that he had created, in which it was apparent that we share a similar desire to achieve a balance between combat (melee) and smiting abilities; in other words, we both wanted to create a balanced paladin/fighter build; <br>because of this, we in essence approached the revisions on this build together, merging our two separate builds together so to speak, such that the Knight Commander, as revised, reflects his former build’s level split (to avoid dispelling and quicker spell access) while, at the same time, retaining my higher smiting and combat AB. <br><br>This build, as revised, does in many ways accordingy represent a joint-effort on our part, in terms of the revisions, and I graciously acknowledge his input and assistance in this regard. I would also like to thank Finneous for his continuing interest and comments not only on this knight, but other knights in my series: thanks also to everyone who commented on him and/or such other knights (including, of course, Grim and my usual coach crew <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     – As always, I appreciate your feedback, and continue to welcome comments – Deborah Tyr.<br><br>To see the original build of this character, check out: <br> <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "244826", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Knight Commander FTR(6)/Paladin (24)/Champion of Torm (10)</a><br><br>To see Mick’s original build, check out: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "217140", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Guardian of Light Paladin26/Fighter4/CoT10)</a><br><br><i>Fixed broken links.

Let me start out by saying that this is a very good build of a Holy Warrior who can deal out some extra "wrath of his god", as well as being able to hold his own without relying on smites at all times.  It is very tough to make a character build that focuses in 2 attributes, and that is actually playable.  Good job.<br><br>Second, only 129 skill points!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">    *shivers with dread*  Hehe, sorry, I have been on a kick lately of getting all the skillpoints I can, I rarely have a character with less than 12 int, and usually try to get at least 14.  Being as stat point starved as you are with this build though, you have to make sacrifices somewhere.  My head tells me you made the right choice to get the extra 40 hps then to go with the extra skill points on this build.  Though I am not sure if I would actually be able to make my Will check while rolling this character up to do that.  I am also thinking that instead of putting the points into Concentration, I would go the Taunt route, to help you out even more offensively.<br><br>A nice, solid Knightly build; well done.<br><br>Almost forgot-  On yer damage calculation, you put 1d8+6, it will actually be 1d8+12 (6 for str modifier, and 6 for Epic Wep Specialization)<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DarkStar27909 on 06/29/06 08:29</span></i></p>

Definitely better AB but some less AC, HPs and skillpoints with respect to the way I would have done it (check the second build in <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "16203", "242837", "0", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>this thread</a> ).

Thanks everyone for the praise on this one; yeah, it's not easy to achieve good AB/combat damage while, at the same time, keeping power-pally goodness. For me, it was about the balance as, once those 3 smite attacks are spent, or in the event your foe's not evil, well....<br><br>For AC and Saves: Relying on some of those nice feats of the pally, and also his spells as thus: AC's taken care of with the Divine Shield &amp; his spells (he's many turn charges, and lots of buffs which, at 26 pally, are long lasting and essentially non-dispellable. Plus, he's that holy sword of his (dispels magic on hit <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     Again, gotta thank Mick for the level split, enables us to rely on buffs with more or less complete confidence <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">             <br><br>But, Dark, if you want better saves, check out my Teutonic Knight build - his saves are higher, with sligtly better AC and more skills than this one, which I agree is nice, especially for PvE; then, there's a cost: he has great smite IV (could take 'em to V, but IV does about +170 or so extra per smite, as opposed to the +204 extra here <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  In turn, Teutonic gets AB 39 (no buffs), but IKD + skills to compensate, w. the higher HPs. I like this knight better, but Teuton def. has charms, and depends on environment - choices, choices <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">             <br><br>Or, for real, check out Kail's ....<br><br>Hey, Kail (nice to see ya. Was wondering when you'd get around to say hello <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">             -- thanks so much for the praise, and for sharing that so very cool sycthe-smiter here - no way I was gonna take yer schtick (but, you know, if you're trying to convince everyone here as to a good weapon to use - me thinks we'll see more pally's out there wielding sycthes - COOL!). Your character is very good and I really like him, too: saves &amp; skills are nice, bit more AC, &amp; smite V too, but cost: combat AB and HPs. Still, with evil foes &amp; smite, only need one (check out that crit scythe smite damage, folks -nice, Kail <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">              <br><br>Thanks everyone, again.<br><br>Deb Tyr<br><br>ps.

Just thought I'd add this link, so everyone can see what exactly are the spells that pally's get to choose from; at 26 level Pally, gets some nice buffs and, in addition to all the divines, the spells also boost saves, AC, AB, etc., while adding some very nice immunities and damage, too, as the following link shows (once again, to everyone who commented and/or helped out on this knight, and/or others in the series, thanks so much - I hope you enjoy this series, and here's that promised link <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <a href="http://www.planetneverwinter.com/nwn/player/spells/paladin/" target="_blank">Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/02/06 01:32</span></i></p>
