Server specific limitations aside, 12 CoT is too much.  Even if you can't squeeze out the WIS for ninth level spells, it's still worth it.  Heck, duration alone is worth more than at least the last two CoT levels.<br><br>Edit: it's also worth noting that, like any low(ish) CHA DM/DS builds, you lose a great deal if you can't get some good CHA gear.<br><br>Edit number two:  Am I blind, or is there no race?  Seems like halfling or gnomish, but it aint human, so there seems to be an XP penalty from levels four on.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By onion eater on 08/31/09 03:58</span></i></p>

Well, normally, one Storm of Vengeance is enough, and it works for PvP, there's no doubt about it, you take the most advantage from the stun effect, not the damage, and 10 rounds of stun is devastating.<br><br>+16 to all saves with just two rings (which you make them sound like the most common thing to get) is quite a big boost though, good enough to lower any spell's effectiveness, but that doesn't mean the spell is not good, it means the environment is not appropiate for a non-heavy-caster to be casting any type of effect spells, same goes for Implosion.<br><br>I don't know how adept are the players you're fighting against in that server, but I've played enough PvP to know there's always some Fighter/RDD or Fighter/Rogue/WM or whatever other build which doesn't even seem to have buffs. Drop an Implosion every now and then and you'll see dead people more than once.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 08/31/09 04:41</span></i></p>

In all the many countless hours of play time, i have NEVER worried about saves.  See, the problem people face when they start down the save track is that your classes become limited.  There are only really a few classes that add to saves (pal, bg and cot).  It ISNT rocket science.  Once you get up in lvls, saves are pretty much fixed by the classes.  Yes, you can take feats, but i did that too, and honestly, it did nothing for me, play wise.  <br><br>Keep in mind, i am different from most.  My philosophy is KILL fast and hard!  That goes for groups as well as one on one.  If you want to be average, continue with your thinking.  The only problem is, its 2009.  iirc, i bought this game in 2002.  Not too sure how much time you have to NOT learn from the wisdom of others though?  <br><br>Oh, i am not sure why you could only get 3 sov's off.  I routinely, when i was playing, used 4-6 at a time for BIG groups of 15 and more (that was me vs 15 monsters).  The ligning actualy has the opportunity to stun them, which is nice, plus damage... OUCH.  Through in 6 firestorms and you wipe out alot.  I routinely did in entire areas of constructs (20+) by myself with this strategy.  But, hey, use the pvp thing for justifyin why you did it.  Afterall, clerics suck in nwn.  In my opinion, the worst class ever invented...

Well, +16 to all saves IS a very powerful boost, it's pretty close to the cap. If your casting stat is anything below 40 with no focuses, a +16 on your enemies' saves is definitely going to hurt. Say, let's assume he's fighting pros, so take a build like Mith's Shin Slasher, which is terrifying as an opponent. He's got only 26/38/21 (vs spells) Fort/Ref/Will, which is ok but not too impressive, but add +16 and you get: 42/54/37, now your chances for Implosion are dead unless you're the highest DC caster and Storm of Vengeance is just not going to work. You're thinking too much into PvM avado, but I can still bet you can find low saves enemies every now and then, a spell as strong as Storm of Vengeance is worth the level, you only get +1 to saves with the last 2 CoT levels anyway.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 09/02/09 01:23</span></i></p>

Thax, you talk and talk and i still have no idea what you say!  jk<br><br>SoV has another thing with it, it stays in one place.

Stun and possible death!  Ive seen it and done it.  16 cleric is not long enough.  Pvp typically have 2 gimped out players so things are high and damage and ac are high, so hits are low.  Add heals and you got real lamity.  Sure an extended 16 is 32 rounds, but if you had 40 caster, thats 80 rounds of not having to worry about recasting and getting a free hit on you.  <br><br>There are so many other reasons but i feel that they will fall on deaf ears.
