Author <br>dragonkillerdojo<br>Are there any multiclass cleric melee archer build ideas? <br> <br><br>Joined: 07 Sep 2004 Profile: Thursday, 06 January 2005 01:39AM <br><br>I am looking for a real good multiclass build with cleric that can do both melee and ranged with longbow and cast 3 or more harm/heal spells (esp vs demi liches..argg..). I get sick of not hitting a target at range with a melee fighter...and not being able to hit a target in melee with an archer. I can build an archer...I can build a melee fighter...I have little experience with a cleric and want to try it for something different. But building both a melee and ranged combatant buffer has eluded me for months.<br>Any ideas? Takers? <br> <br><br>//  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  //  // // /// /// <br>            <br>Kaliban99 <br><br>Joined: 04 Jun 2003<br>From: Colorado<br> Profile: Thursday, 06 January 2005 02:36AM <br><br>This thread will be locked because you're in the wrong forum for general questions.

I'm not really familiar with any specific archer builds, but I would suggest something like a human Fighter 8/CoT 14/Cleric 18. Starting attributes like,<br>STR 16<br>DEX 10<br>CON 14<br>WIS 14<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8<br><br>Use your attribute bonuses and a couple of regular feats for STR bonus, take most of your CoT levels epic and use the bonus feats for great wisdom.  Use the fighter feats for weapon foci etc.  You should be able to manage a 28-30 STR and 20 WIS.  Thus with zen-archery you would be a good archer and good in melee.  You might even manage dev crit with either your melee or ranged weapon (I doubt you would have the feats for both).  A Cleric/Bard/RDD would be another option.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 01/07/05 00:24</span></i></p>
