What kind of damage is it? Is there any effective way to guard against it? IGMS really annoys me because it always seems to be the biggest potential weakness of _every_ single one of my builds in PvP, especially anything that can't soak more than two.

The damage is magic. I don't know if regular DR stops it, but X/magic I know does. Also variosu mage protection spells work well. Rakasha form for shifters laughs at sorcerers tossing mass IGMs.

Since you get bonuses, only take spell resistances during that, but you can take couple during normal feat selection as well. I was able to get up to Improved Spell Resistance VII with feats that I took in order to make the build stronger(ie; great cleave, Epic Weapon Focus, etc).<br><br>The build that I did was able to get spell resistance to 64. And had epic weapon focus(unarmed strike)*, and Ki Strike +5 which can bypass creature's damage reduction. This type of monk should be able to take out any caster in couple rounds before the IGMs can take the monk out. And don't forget, the monk can get damage reduction of 20/+1.<br><br>In my opinion, this build isn't really useless. It is useful when used in party, if there is a caster in emeny group and no one in your party can't get close enough because of the IGMs. Just walk in and kick the caster's arse because of your spell resistance. And your group, say one of them is Fighter, you can use the fighter to distract any caster's defenders(ie; familiars, or guard which is fighter in that enemy group).<br><br>If you did that, you would be able to take out the caster.<br><br>Anuis

No it's definitely not useless, and of course has its own set of strengths, but against most melee characters and archers it will get thoroughly demolished, for one of two reasons: 1.

Regular damage resistance is worthless, as is any kind of elemental resistance. You need MAGICAL damage resistance, which really appears on very few items in most modules.  However, if you are playing on a server that allows custom equipment, a measly 5/- magical resistance will pretty much nullify IGMS.  There is not way to do this directly to your character, however, it can only be conferred by equipment.  While you're at it, you might want to consider fire resistance because, as soon as the caster sees twenty zero's roll up over your head, he will rethink his strategy quickly.  For a sorceror, this probably means flame arrow as the next resort.<br>_________________<br>Où est ma tête?

I didn't mention wis monk because it will have no ab or damage output to speak of, unless it does zen archery in which case it loses a lot of monk bonuses and still has no damage output to speak of.

To get any halfway decent sneak attack you'll need several rogue levels, meaning your SR loses quite a bit of effectiveness and you miss out on some monk feats (which were being used for SR). Which isn't to say you can't make a decent monk/rogue, you just can't get spectacular SR out of it.<br>Once again, sorry if it seems like I'm arguing just for the sake of argument. I probably am.

If you shift to couple of the shapes, most of them should have immunity to most of the spells. Possibly Raskasha I think. Also, by doing Dragon Shape, you would be able to get real nice attack and decent spell resistance(22 I believe). Also, they are immune to spells as well. Especially if you do Infinite Elemental Shape(Improved Elemental Shape as well).<br><br>The build that I did recently(not posted yet), it was able to get 200ish damage from breath weapon against 15 AC creature. And it also can damage 60 AC creature by 20-40ish. The weapon never misses... but as for physical attack, it misses most of the time against high AC creatures. And it has many ability to cast certain spells that can severely hurt the caster class.<br><br>Anyway.... All of the shapes that you take, they compense for low STR, DEX, and CON. When you change, they will increase to 30ish depending on shape you change into. But there are few circumstances where it only increases WIS and INT, which is flayer I think.<br><br>I am not sure if I am making any sense... lol.<br><br>Anuis

But you only can do that if you have Shifter class. You have to be epic shifter in order to take Outsider Shape(which gives you Rakshasa shape), plus 25 WIS. You can take 11 shifter levels and be able to get some monk class. If you want 6 monk levels, add that to the amount of shifter levels, which is 17. Then add in six druid levels in order to access shifter class I think. That leaves you 17 levels to mess around with.<br><br>Anuis

There's one thing I forgot to factor in with SR... Mordekainen's Disjunction, which doesn't allow SR or any save, lowers your SR by 10, meaning that even if you blew 10 feats for a 70 SR Monk, a caster could lower it to 60 and penetrate about a quarter of the time. If you had a pure cleric/druid, they'd be able to drop you to 42 SR, meaning that even if they were only 26 pure, if they had epic spell penetration they'd penetrate 50% of the time, and if they were at least 36 pure, they'd penetrate 100% of the time.<br>Have I mentioned yet that I hate IGMS?<br>And xitooner... I don't understand what that has to do with anything <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> . Plus that build would have 10 less SR.

And so a well-built pure caster will chuckle at nearly ALL builds, from an SR standpoint, since only a near-pure Monk can have an SR they would even need to take a passing notice of, yes?  So I think I'll just let them chuckle.  I mean, if you cant even devote 10 levels to something else, then whats the point?  From my point of view, if you cant win in that aspect, then its time to look for another area to improve, and be satisfied with the fact that (for example) a 30/10 Monk/XXX will naturally have more SR than 99% of all builds, which will be extremely effective against a lots of builds; but not a near-pure caster.   <br>  <br>Or. . .you can focus near-pure Monk, and probably build something that has high-SR and is well able to beat a pure-Sorc run by the average joe.  I do agree that this kind of build is very nice for beating high-level casters. But the tactics for a Sorc beating a high-SR monk are pretty standard too; ie Mestils, etc.  But lets say you do make it through, and kill all those pure-casters. All you've done is make youself so focussed on beating the top dog that some other build for whom SR is a non-issue is going to clean YOUR clock.  <br><br>And thats PvP in a nutshell. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Normal kids play rock-paper-scissors.<br>Shifter kids play IronGolem-RustMonster-MindFlayer. . .

Once again, that was exactly my point xitooner. To have effective SR against a pure caster, you have to make a ***ty build. Whether you can make a decent monk build with effective SR against half-breed casters or not is an entirely different issue.<br>And just for the sake of argument, if you made a 30 monk and didnt use feats to raise SR, with MD you'd be dropped to 30 SR, so a lvl 21 caster with epic spell penetration would land on you on a roll of 4 or higher.. 80% of the time.<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

Has anyone considered the skill Taunt? If you can successfully taunt a caster they will have 30% spell failure. If you couple that with a decent SR then the numbers would be in your favor. Just a thought I had.

That is an interesting thought though, and I'll definitely take it into consideration.<br>And here goes: it lasts for five rounds, and I'm guessing it takes one round to perform. Now let's assume those five rounds are after your original taunt, that means six rounds total, one of which you lose. 1/6 = 16.66% They lose, in contrast 30% of their rounds, so when you subtract what they lose from what you lose, it's barely over a 13% advantage. And this is assuming you land your taunt every time, first time.<br>Now, let's say you have a 43 taunt. They have a 43 concentration. From what I gather of the manual, each person does a check, in other words each person adds 1d20 to their score. So you fail 50% of the time, effectively doubling your time lost without affecting theirs at all (and also giving them some rounds without any arcane failure). Now you lose more "battle-time" than they do.<br>Now if you used Epic Skill Focus: Taunt, you could increase your effectiveness (assuming they didn't have skill focus concentration, which many casters do) to 75%, which is a little better. But considering you only had a 13% advantage assuming 100% effectiveness, you're probably looking at sub-10% now. (You could also boost your taunt with charisma, and they could boost their concentration with constitution, as a sidenote).<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

Well if you used a build that has a good charisma such as paladin, bg, or bard then I believe that your taunt will be able to overcome most spellcasters concentration check. Most casters that I know don't put a lot of stats into constitution.<br><br>As for actually performing the taunt I'm not sure if it takes a round or not. I've been playing with a bard and I'll do bard song, then curse song, then taunt and sometimes after the curse song the taunt happens instantly.

It takes a full round and by the time you've gotten in range of the caster to taunt they have usually time stopped and killed you.

Yes time stop would hurt you a lot but I have not been in one server so far that allows that spell. So basically you can discount that spell out.<br><br>Another method you could use is the spell silence. I know there is a save vs the spell if you cast it on an opponent but if you cast it on yourself that is a different story. It creates a radius around you and anyone that enters it can't cast spells.

Rushing in with a silence spell on yourself will prevent a caster from casting a spell.

Yes a lot of cleric builds use this tactic (espcially tank clerics). They have auto silence and then they use greater sanctuary to get in close. Then it's usually easy pickings.
