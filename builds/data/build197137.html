I like the build, but I would start with a 16 Dex and 14 Wisdom.  I would rather have a 2 AC bonus (more with items) from Wisdom, and access to the admitedly crappy ranger spells (but ultravision is handy), than the 1AB and 1 AC bonus from the difference between 16 and 18 DEX.  Just me though.  <br><br>The assassin was for uncanny dodge, I think.  Rather important for a DEX build.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.rpgmods.net/forgottenworlds/phpBB2/" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

your absolutely right Yar, i always keep forgetting about monk lvls in this build, i usually just focus on the 10 attacks.<br><br>But with the new stats:<br>14<br>16<br>10<br>14<br>14<br>8<br><br>you get -1 AB, +1 AC to the original numbers.<br>you also get +3 will saves<br>and you get Aid which grants you +1 AB and +1 vs fear

Why not keep the original starting stats and go for Ranger 35 / Barbarian 2 / Assassin 3 ? That way you get the 10% movement bonus and Uncanny Dodge from the Barbarian levels, and an extra d6 of death attack.

Assassin doesn't get evasion. He took 2 assassin originally for the uncanny dodge on lvl 2 assasin. It was the monk lvls that gave him evasion. I think he made the best fit for the character from the start and the rest of this is all something that makes the character weaker IMO. Nice build Aluka. It's fully optimized from the start and it is very playable. Good job.

thanks for the comments <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">     <br>I would like to also point out some strengths of this build:<br><br>up to 10 attacks<br>10% movement<br>evation + great reflex saves<br>13 racial groups as FEs<br>pretty good AB<br>Excellent AC (AC from Dex and Wis)<br>full tumble, full UMD and a lot of skill points to spare.<br>and farily good saves (add 3 to will in the original post)<br><br>and the most important....<br><br>Very playable from lvl 1 onwards<br><br>most of this is due to the monk lvls<br>since this is a fighter type build however, he is not restricted to using kamas, he is also a true marksman (like any good ranger) and if need be, he can go medieval on you with a couple of maces.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By aluka on 06/01/05 02:44</span></i></p>
