Ability allocation on creation is tough on a build that needs strength, dexterity, constitution, wisdom, and charisma.  Something had to give and it was constitution and intelligence.

An impressive build.. I tried a class split similar to this (23 Sorc/15 Paladin/2 Monk) but I went armor and shield (for some CON).<br><br>Just a shame you cannot fit in 3 more Sorceror levels for Epic Warding. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cry.gif">

Very nice.  I also tried a more Sorc heavy version of this build and was quite impressed.  As you say, a little tricky until you get your Sorc buffs.<br><br>I would also agree that you should pick up Divine Might.  Especially as Divine Might will all get a nice x3 applied to your Halberd crits (as will Divine Favor and I believe Bless and Prayer, iirc).<br><br>Anyway, looks good.<br><br>Cheers.<br><br>EDIT: Will the Keen Weapon spell work on a Halberd?
