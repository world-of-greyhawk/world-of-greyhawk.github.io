Alone, out in the woods, burnt a campfire, with a lone figure sitting in front of it.<br><br>"See boss, easy pickins, like I said"<br>"Indeed.  But does he have anything worth my time?"<br>"I saw him making camp.  He laid down one of the plumpest looking coin purses I have ever seen.  And the way his pack jingled, there had to be..." a quick mental calculation, "...lots more"<br>"Then we shall liberate his purse, for a small service of course.  Tell the others to move into place.  Surround him and prepare.  He way have a weapon."<br>"Yeah boss.  Not killin is a service, right?"<br>"Indeed."<br><br>As the highwaymen moved into place, an unnatural quiet settled upon the area.  All of the crows in the nearby trees had decided to quiet down.  The thieves moved into position, shadows through the foliage.<br>"Arrgh!"<br>A helpless figure hung upside down, his foot caught in a noose.<br>Arcane words, and the campfire was snuffed out.  More words, this time the figure, now standing, disappeared from plain sight.  More words were heard, as though at once a whisper and a scream.<br>"Find him, kill him, take his things, and be careful! This one is a mage!" screamed the leader.<br>More arcane words drifted on the night air, this time filling the night with powerful energy.  The energy collasced around the body of the leader, as if a giant hand were holding him in place.  The mage appeared before him.<br>"Mistake one: Attacking."<br>Behind the mage came a thief, pushing his blade into the mages back.  The blade bent against the stone-like skin of the mage.<br>In a blur the leader saw the mage turn, producing a razor-sharp blade as we went, and neatly cut off the head of his would-be assassin.<br>Before he could register the amazing blade prowess this simpe mage had just demonstrated, the mage moved again, this time producing a second blade.  He quickly made work of the second and third thieves within his reach, slicing their arms in strategic places so that they could no longer attack.  The remaining thieves had stopped dead in their tracks once they realized that the mage was looking at each of them in turn, despite the fact that they were well hidden.  They wanted to live long enough to spend that gold.  Turning back to their leader, the mage continued to speak.<br>"Mistake two: Continuing the attack."<br>With a simple gesture, the supposed mage dismissed the hand holding the higwaymens leader.<br>"If you can leave this campground alive, then you are welcome to go.  I should warn you, there are traps.  One has already been found.  You might make it if you go the exact way you came in.  Maybe."<br>With that the mage grabbed his pack, and seemed to merge with the shadows until he was no longer there.<br>The leader of the higwaymen was shaking, standing in a pile of his own filth.  He hoped that he could remember the way back out.<br><br><br>The Undecided Spellblade<br><br>He is undecided because he is of True Neutral alignment.<br><br><b>playable 1-40, PvM</b><br><br>Got the idea from a number of spellsword builds I was looking through, in particular Mith's Ferromancer and grizz's Professional.

What I like about this list is that he can get some nice damage spells using empower spell.  With an item that grants spell penetration or something similar, he can do some nice arcane damage.  With some rogue- or assassin-esque clothing/equipment he can sneak with the best of them, and as a bare naked warrior he just needs a good rapier or two, and maybe a tower shield for backup.<br><br>Obviously, for equipment, he would prefer keen rapiers, a tower shield, some wizard and monk robes, monk boots, constitution boosting equipment and saving throw boosting equipment.  More AC doesn't hurt either.  Trap kits are nice, but can usually be salvaged when he finds them.<br>_________________<br>"Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life.

I think that the bump up from the Wizard bonus feat for Great Intelligence only kicks in after I have leveled up, thus I cannot choose Great Sanc or Premonition.  Probably not a big loss, since I cam use the slots for Emp IGMS or something, but Ext Spell Mantle or something like that, but I like to have Great Sanc for just an emergency.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>There's some more tweaking here, but that's a start, and I'm on the run.

It looks to me like you have several non-essential feats in the later pre-epic levels. I'd drop one of them, push other feats down to fill the gap, and take weapon proficiency:exotic early on. That way you can use kukri instead of rapier, gaining +2 ab while dualwielding, and making use of the keen edge spell.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By pulse cap on 07/27/05 21:01</span></i></p>

The kukri route is definately a good option here.  I choose dual rapiers because I wanted to dual wield something bigger with a dex build, and see if I could still get a decent AB.  I did alright.  Also, I think that dual longer swords looks pretty cool.  Kinda like the character Skillgannon the Damned from David Gemmel's books.  Also, called shot, while normally considered an archer feat i think it can be useful against those with high AB, and also to allow you to run away from crippled crowds if low on spells, HPs and cure potions.<br>Good point! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-C<br>_________________<br>"You cannot pass!"
