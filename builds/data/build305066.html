"Born of blue blood, her face as innocent as a newborn and her skin as pure as honey.

Not so much a criticism, constructive or otherwise, but there's a typo in the title.  Says "barb 26/RDD10/PM10."

For the record, I like the build.  Not super flashy, but the bard gets you all the flash you really need.<br><br>I hear ya on the keen senses thing, but I'd think w/ the HP being so low here, elf is the last race you'd want to use.  On the other hand, you could drop exotic and use a longsword, which would at least give you one more practical reason to use elf.  Nit-picky, yeah, but how about using search since you have those keen senses?  I think you could spare the skill points.<br><br>But, yeah, as avado says, race could easily be swapped out.  I just can't help but feel like elf is the last race I'd use.

I am certainly missing something important, so I ask.<br><br>Why RDD9 pre-epic? Instead of going Bard12/RDD8.<br><br>Why RDD10 at lvl 39???? It gives you sooo much compared to the other 9 levels I just can't figure out why you take it later than lvl 22. Can't really see any skill needed to be dumped at a RDD level either, since Bard has it all.<br><br>The Exotic proficiency is mostly useless too, agreed. Don't underestimate concentratiion either, several of the Bardspells are Verbal spells, the most important is Darkness. Dropping a Darkness in combat can really save the day.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

RDD gains no BAB at level 9, therefore, if you leave the ninth level into epics, you gain +1 BAB with absolutely no loss whatsoever, not even playability here.<br><br>It is kinda wrong to take the tenth RDD level so late.

Yah, RDD10 at the end kinda makes this a lvl 40 build.  I mean, I guess it doesn't make it <i>unplayable</i> 1-40, but it's a huge and lamentable loss while leveling.  Can't ya just be happy w/ listen?

NO way does taking rdd at 39 make this unplayable!  OMG!  What has happened to this topic when avado is for and the rest are against!  LOL jk<br><br>I know it is different, but it in no way makes it incorrect.  Whether or not i would do it in this build, who knows.  We are talking about Dark's build, and he likes it at 39.  Besides, it makes the stretch to 39 more exciting!  I see it as motivation to get to 40!  There are always 2 or more sides to every coin.  Let's start lookin at the GOOD side (yes, I said it!

In a server that you can level to 40 in, it's more fun if your build matures (even if you dont) around 30 so you can compete with almost all the epics.

Besides, building for level 40 is a totally acceptable thing to do.  Even if I wouldn't build this way, I can't say it's 'wrong.'  Besides, it's a simple enough thing to move RDD 10 into early epics, if that's what you want.  It's not build breaking in the least.

LOL  a monkey can do it!  and i have seen a monkey build a few!!  LOL  <br><br>lv 40 builds involve no thought or appreciation for what it is to play a character.  For example, doing a cleric/wiz and taking wiz first shows no appreciation to how much easier it is to lvl clerics, not to mention now having the wiz feats in EPIC, as epic feats, <br><br>That said, taking rdd at 39 isnt a bad thing. You dudes are bein mean and i really dont want to see Dark cry!  And for the record, a build like this ISNT a static thing.  I dont think i have EVER plaed a build that i have made or have borrowed that is exactly as written.  As you play you find out about the pw (i wont talk of those cake-walk mods <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ) so you make adjustments.  For example, on one server scribe scroll is a GOD feat, yet on others it is a waste.
