I've never played a Cleric before, which I'm sure seems ludicrous to most of you, but I'm not so good with all the buffs and whatnot.  However, I've seen and read a great deal about the power and effectiveness of Clerics, and have been itching to try one out.<br><br>The melee oriented Clerics are attractive because that is the style of play that I prefer, but I'm very curious to try a Cleric that is more oriented towards spellcasting.<br><br>Particularly, I'm thinking of trying a Cleric build that focuses on either Implosion, or Harm.  The problem is, I don't really understand too well how the spells work and the particulars, especially for Implosion.<br><br>I know that Harm reduces an opponent's HP a great deal (to 1 HP?  Or the amount gained by a Heal spell?) but I have no conception of what Implosion is all about.<br><br>I would appreciate any help you can provide.  Thanks!

It's an area of effect spell that forces a fort save to avoid death to all within the area of effect (casting cleric apart in full PvP setting). Simple as that. It is not death magic so death ward does not protect against it.<br><br>The save DC for implosion gets a nice +3, therefore:<br><br><b>DC (Implosion)= 28 +WIS modifier</b><br><br>assuming SF/GSF/ESF: Evocation are taken.<br><br><br>All my WIS based clerics are imploders, at the moment I'm having fun with a Cleric 26/Bard 4/RDD 10, WIS based, which thanks to RDD happens to be a quite strong meleer too. PM me or post here if you need a build layout, or use the <a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/search/builds.htm" target="_blank">search engine</a> and check out the cleric heavy builds.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Unto to the darkness<br>I commend my soul<br>Never shall I repent<br>Never shall I be saved<br><br>I'll go into the House of Death<br>Before my last breath<br>My enemies all shall die!
