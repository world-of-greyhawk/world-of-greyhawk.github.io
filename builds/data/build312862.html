<b>Forest Shadow</b><br><br><b>Druid 30, Assassin 9, Monk 1</b><br><br><i><br>Sinvyl was already casting protective magic on herself before the first droplets of green rain hit the ground...<br><br>The other three also felt the disturbance in the air. Sinvyl saw it first - behind Gromph - a ghostly silhouette of an elven woman.<br><br>"BEHIND YOU!" she yelled. Reading between the lines, Gromph drew his rapier in a reverse grip and stabbed in the appropiate direction...<br><br>...but there was no impact. Not even the vibration and red flash that comes from plunging the enchanted rapier through a spectre of the underdark. Just fine smoky strands of shadow still hovering over the blade's path, and then quickly reforming. The blade had gone through her...but she was unhurt.<br><br>Just as Gromph finished his swing, Sinvyl saw the elven woman place her hand on Gromph's forehead. A pillar of red light rose from Gromph as he screamed in pain, and Sinvyl could tell that this was necromancy; Gromph's vitality pouring out like a burst river dam, his dark skin cracking and drying rapidly. At that moment, Sinvyl understood: this was no paranormal being, the apparition drew upon divine magic to cast 'Harm'... a powerful spell, but easily countered with 'Heal'...she's a spellcaster, the ghostly form probably an after effect from an invisibility spell. But as Sinvyl raised her hands to cast 'Heal', a lightning bolt struck Gromph...and he was dead.<br><br>How could she forget the green rain, the clouds they fall from are swirling with divine magic! Her hands now pointing at the elven attacker, Sinvyl casts the first lethal spell that came to mind...'finger of death'. To her astonisment, a blue barrier materialized around the elf...a spell mantle. How could someone who just conjured a maelstorm of divine magic create an equally powerful arcane barrier!<br><br>Before Sinvyl could arrive at an answer, darkness decended upon the party. This was also arcane magic, for Sinvyl's Drow eyes could not penetrate it. As she casted 'ultravision', she heard Mizzyrm scream, followed by a wet thud...and then silence.<br><br>And then Sinvyl saw the towering silhouette of a dragon moving towards Ilueph.<br><br>Sinvyl didn't bother casting protective magic on Ilueph, the attacker is far too strange, a shapeshifter, and a wielder of both divine and arcane magic...as the dragon clawed through Ilueph's heavy armor, she instead took the opportunity to prepare to cast Mordenkainen's Disjunction on the dragon. As an exalted sorceress, her spell would definitely purge whatever magical defenses the attacker had cast. And Sinvyl let out an amused huff when the dragon suddenly became corporeal. She could sense all the layers of protection collapsing under the sheer power of her spell.<br><br>But her mirth was short-lived...Sinvyl soon realized that Ilueph was dead. And the dragon still unhurt, had already swung a claw at her. There was a deafening clang as the claw bounced off Sinvyl's protective wards. Relieved that her wards were strong enough, Sinvyl continued to bolster her protection...'elemental shield'...'acid sheath'...'shadow shield'...whatever spells were left over from her mission.<br><br>The dragon stopped attacking. It understood the destructive nature of those barriers. With a sigh of relief, Sinvyl took her time in summoning a Balor. <br><br>The ground cracked and shook violently. Out of the pits of hell, came forth the Balor. With a mighty roar, the demonic general descended upon the dragon and swung his vorpal sword at the dragon's neck...<br><br>...and the dragon evaded it with unerring grace. The second swing was countered by the dragon's claws. There never was a third swing, for the dragon followed up from its counter, plunging its claws into the Balor's head, and dismissing it back into the dephts of hell. Unfortunate that the dragon remained unhurt, but the Balor bought Sinvyl enough time to cast her ultimate spell...the wail of the banshee...<br><br>...and then as the summoned banshee cried, the tree leaves turned brown and fell, the birds in the air fell, the fish in the river floated belly up, the grass wilted and blackened...and the dragon faded into thin air. All was quiet. Sinvyl congratulated herself. Only then did Sinvyl notice the pain she was in...again she had forgotten about the acidic rain, even now the green droplets eat into her skin...<br><br>..and a bolt of lightning struck her...she didn't have time to shield her mind from paralyzation, the lightning bolt fried her nerves, her senses scrambled, her head in a daze...<br><br>...the last thing she saw: the shadow of an elven lady before the shadow of the forest, her hand reaching for Sinvyl's forehead, the seal of The Harpers in the palm of that hand...<br><br><br>"Long Live the Valsharess" she thought as the world faded out...<br><br></i><br><br>Gah...should have been reviewing for SAT IIs...<br><br>BTW, I have nothing against exalted sorceresses, I just thought it'd add to the awesomeness effect (^_^)<br><br><br><b>Similar Builds</b><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "232049", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>...posted by Thax 3 years ago though, and ain't legal anymore...<br><br><br>Well, it sure is nice that my final dragon build is somewhat original (^_^). <br><br>It started with getting concealment on a dragon, to avoid devastating critical and AB freaks and the like. Of course, the easiest way to do that is Improved Invisibility. Problem was that taking 10 levels of wizard, sorcerer, or anything that gave improved invisibility, sacrificed all those druid levels that i'm not willing to part with (benefits buff durations, spell resistance, etc.)<br><br>The assassin however...provided both improved invisibility and the UMD skill, thus allowing access to other defensive buffs and spells, thus making up for the loss of spell resistance.

Also if the spell is cast as an area of effect, the mantle for sure would be breached as well as one other breachable buff, and then the highest remaining buff will get a dispel check.  So, no spell mantle doesn't help much against the exalted sorceress. <br><br>Clerics have a lot of AB buffs: divine power, bless, aid, prayer, divine favor, battletide, war domain.  For strength there is aura of vitality (war domain spell), bull's strength, and strength domain.

Prayer, Battletide, Divine Power are rounds per level; Divine Favor is 10 rounds. All other buffs are long lasting (turns or hours/level). With extend spell the short term buffs will last from 20 rounds (2 minutes real time) for DF to 80 rounds (8 minutes real time) for the other spells and at Cleric 40; 40 rounds for the short term buffs is most often more than enough. <br><br>Mord is not as overpowered as it is in PnP, btw. Your protection against it is to have a high caster level yourself and to buff up with anything at your disposal, including redundancies (eg, greater spell mantle+spell mantle+lesser spell mantle or premonition+greater stoneskin+stoneskin) so that the breach effect will affect only a minor and known part of your buffs. In fact breach affects breachable spells in a very specific order, up to its limit (2-4-6).<br><br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Breach" target="_blank">Breach</a><br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Other.Detail&amp;id=729" target="_blank">Neverwinter Grimoire</a><br><a href="http://www.nwnwiki.org/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWN Wiki</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/08/09 21:29</span></i></p>

If you mean the specific Exalted Sorceress posted here on this site, yes.  However, there are numerous variations of 38/1/1 for sorcerer which would still wipe the floor with you...heck, any 30+ mage will wipe the floor with you under base rules.  Probably 20+ mage, actually.  Or...dare I say 18+ mage?

Now that you mention it, the Forest Shadow can use a time stop scroll, run up to the exalted sorc, cast harm, dragon shape and then whack her and lol at the rest of the party...

Dude, the exalted sorc most probably wont be harmed.  Infact, it is sort of an unwritten rule with caster types NOT to rely on a spell to deal damage to them.  You actually want to KD them OR hit them in order to hopefully break concentration.  Relying on harm is NOT a good idea cuz, unlike the idea that it is automatic, I have had it resisted with ALOT higher DC's than this druid has!   <br><br>Also, time stop isnt a good spell to rely on either as many PW's have taken it out cuz of servrr lag or fairness or whatever their reason!   <br><br>Besides that, sure!  I still put my money on the 24 max IGMS hittin you square on the face and dying!  Remember, IF we are talking exalted vs your dragon, you'd have to get the designer of exalted to use her (afterall, in this hypothetical match its only fair), and cd was a nwn genius, meanwhile, you have NEVER played online.. exalted 10 forest 0  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   but who really cares :{
