Maybe try a Barb/Fighter/Cleric build?  Maybe something like Barb 21/Fighter 4/Cleric 15, or something of that nature.  If you take all 3 Damage Reduction feats, you can get 13/- DR, which isn't bad for a non-Dwarven Defender build.  In addition, you should be able to get Epic Weapon Spec, provided that you take your 4th Fighter level in Epic levels, 8th lvl Cleric spells, and at least one of the Epic Barbarian Rage feats (Thundering Rage, Terrifying Rage, etc.)
