I love bard builds in all form, I even have a half-orc bard in my local vault.<br><br>But here is the question..I am looking for a bard-heavy build to play, preferbly a STR build over dex. There are no real restrictions other than I don't really want the usual bard/PM/RDD type builds.<br><br>I have never really used dwarves so it would be nice if that race could be incorporated into the build.  Any ideas?<br><br>Thanks in advance

Just to be clear, are you willing to look at Bard/FTR/RDD builds, or did you mean you don't want ti use RDD or PM at all?<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

sorry Cinn, I don't want to use either the RDD or PM classes. I realise the RDD does give you a lot of strength bonii, but I would prefer not to use it.

Is this for the OC?<br><br>If not, how high of a magical world is it?  Some sort of Bard/Cleric/Fighter would be cool, maybe... 20 Bard 15 Cleric 5 Fighter.  That would get EWS, great dmg w/ Divine Might, and some nice buffs.  If you're on a PW that doesn't allow heal potions, go 18 base WIS so you can grab some heals.  14 base should work, since afaik, you can hit the magic cap w/o Warcry.  You may desire 16 base, though.  All in all, I think it ends with around 64 AB self-buffed, if you can reach the +12 str cap.

I built my half orc as a dexer for the OC, which was kinda fun.<br><br>I would like the str build for the damage maybe using a heavier weapon than the dwarven waraxe, possibly a greataxe or scythe.<br><br>The world I'm playing on atm is a medium-high magic world, dev crit has been disabled.

You could try a Bard-Barian (bard/barbarian).  There is no reason beyond the fact that it is fun to say, but I have enjoyed playing it.  I went 20/20...not really well thought out.  Maybe you can perfect it.  I bet dex would be the way to go, but maybe strength could work too.<br>_________________<br>Calling out to the little known class of Bard-barians.  Your brute creativity has been acknowledged!  Stand and yelp, for it is time to unite.

Bard 35 Blackguard 3 Barbarian 2.  Strength based, divine shield, uncanny dodge, Lasting Song, high caster level, heaps of skill points, and plenty of Bard epic bonus feats for ESF's in Taunt, PP, Discipline, Perform, or some Great Charisma feats for better Divine Shield and really good saves.<br><br>Bard 20 Blackguard 4 Barbarian 16.  Strength based.  Curse song plus Terrifying rage = nasty!  Can probably fit Thundering Rage in, as well.  Divine Shield.  Uncanny dodge.  Lasting Inspiration.  Need I say more?<br><br>Bard 23 CoT 10 Wm 7.  Strength based.  AC isn't so good, but 16-20/x4 Handaxe crits are nice.  Actually, just about any weapon with a WM is nice.  Lasting Inspiration, Divine Wrath, decent saves.<br><br>Bard 26 Blackguard 4 Rogue 10 (or 23 4 13 dex based for epic dodge).  Strength Based.  Divine Shield, Uncanny dodge, crippling strike, decent sneak attacks, heaps of skill points, set epic traps.<br><br>Bard 26 Blackguard 4 Shadowdancer 10.  Dex based, almost same as above, just not as good sneak damage, but epic dodge and hips are nice.  But, a little tight on feats.<br><br>Bard 23 CoT 12 Cleric 5 (or 25 10 5).  Strength based.  Dev crit.  True Seeings with Animal domain, and shot lasting cleric ab buffs.  Divine Shield.  Excellent saves.<br><br>Bard 25 Harper Scout 5 Cot 10.  Dex based.  Obscene saves while bugging Tymoras smile.  Not much else that's exciting about it.<br><br>Bard 26 Ranger 9 Cleric 5.  Strength or Dex based.  Dual wielder, epic traps, True Seeing.  Lasting Inspiration.<br><br>Bard 20 Blackguard 4 Sorcer 16.  Divine Shield, True Seeing, Lasting Inspiration.  Breach + Negative Energy Burst.  True Strike.  Self explanatory.<br><br>Bard 26 Fighter 12 Assassin 2 (or 20 6 14 dex based, for decent sneak damage). Epic Weapon Specialization.  Dev Crit.  Uncanny.  Epic traps.<br><br>And that's just a small sampling.  Bards are so versatile, aren't they?  I got kinda lazy typing there, but all of those should have lasting inspiration.<br><br>Edit:  Ignore my mentioning Dev crit in a couple of these, I just saw that it's disabled on your PW <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_redface.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Hiwatt on 02/21/08 00:52</span></i></p>

Bromium I have dug out a bard/druid/monk from Pulse Cap, and to be honest it's the hardest build I've had to level and this is on another server which is geared towards dragon form <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cry.gif">  .<br><br>Thank you Hiwatt for those suggestions, I will try each one <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  , if I find one that can work well as a STR based I will post the build for you guys to tear apart <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  .

I made a Spider Bard at the office.  Insane Discipline coupled with Improved Disarm.  Druid 5 / Shifter 15 / Bard 20.<br><br>Focused on Epic Drider.  Large Weapon (Spear) with curse song and Improved Disarm is rather nasty.  Max Taunt, and Empowered spells...<br><br>Not THE hardest hitting bard out there, but a darn good one.<br><br>Spider Bard, Spider Bard, does whatever a Spider Bard does.<br>Casts a missile, spins some darkness,<br>He hits haard...<br>Lookout it's Spider Bard....<br><br>*shrug*
