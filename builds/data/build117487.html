If you pop up in the middle of a group of baddies and hit one of them with two 24d6 Death Attacks (the first two attacks will happen almost simultaneously), the next baddy takes 24d6 in the back, and then next, and so on until one of them survives or they're all dead. Worst case, some of them do survive, but at least one of them has a -2 Strength penalty, and then you use Hide in Plain sight and rinse and repeat.<br><br>The feat progression is taking into account slow level-progression (defensive feats are taken first). Prestige Classes don't factor in for xp penalties due to level-gaps, so you're solid there as well.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/26/08 08:07</span></i></p>

Hi All <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>OK I built this guy and you can't take 12 levels of assassin pre-epic so I took rogue for levels 19 &amp;20 then two levels of assassin, then the one level of SD and the rest assassin, it works out the same, you get all the feats, not sure if this has any impact.
