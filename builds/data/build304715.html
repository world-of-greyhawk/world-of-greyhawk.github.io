Hey everyone, <br><br>I'm excited for the help I recieved from you guys with the first character I posted on this forum and the level of improvement I was able to achieve. Now I kinda feel more confident in my character creation skills (or should I say less ignorant? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    ), and would like to share another build I came up with recently. I have seen some similar builds, but nothing with this level distribution (which is kind of odd because IMO it's the best possible one), the one I liked most was from Grizzled Dwarflord, but I don't know how to add links to the post, so I can't show you which one.<br><br>I've played the beginning of the SOU campaign and most of the HOTU. I know it's not a REAL test for any build, before you say anything, but before I can solve the problems with The Aielund Saga, that is all I have to go with. The real test to this build will be showing it to you people, but I'm really confident that you'll like this one (at least better than you liked the previous one).<br><br>One more thing: I know I said I hated LAWFUL ROGUES, and I still do, but when I thought of this build, I had no story in mind, which gave me enough room to go through with it. Here it is:<br><br><br><br><br><b><i>THE SILENT DEATH DEALER - RANGER (21) / MONK (2) / ROGUE (17)</i></b><br><i>Elf, Lawful Neutral</i><br><br><br><br><b>ABILITIES(ending)</b><br>STR 14 <br>DEX 16 (30)<br>CON 12 <br>WIS 14 <br>INT 14 <br>CHA <br><br><br><br><b>BASIC STATS</b><br>Hit Points: 398<br>Skill Points: 326<br><br>Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 23/28/18<br><br>Naked AC: 32<br><br>BAB: 30<br>AB (dual wield mundane Kukris): 41<br><br>Spellcasting: Ranger (21)<br><br><br><br><b>SKILLS</b><br>Concentration (43), Discipline (43), Hide (43), Move Silently (43), Listen (43), Use Magic Device (42), Tumble (40), Set Trap (25), Heal (4)<br><br><br><br><b>LEVELING GUIDE</b><br>01- Ranger(1) - Weapon Proficiency Exotic, Favored Enemy 1 (Undead)<br>02- Ranger(2)<br>03- Ranger(3) - Weapon Finesse<br>04- Ranger(4) - DEX +1 (17)<br>05- Ranger(5) - Favored Enemy 2 (Constructs)<br>06- Ranger(6) - Weapon Focus (Kukri), Animal Companion (Panther)<br>07- Ranger(7)<br>08- Ranger(8) - DEX +1 (18)<br>09- Ranger(9) - Knockdown<br>10- Ranger(10) - Favored Enemy 3 (Elementals)<br>11- Ranger(11)<br>12- Ranger(12) - Improved Knockdown, DEX +1 (19)<br>13- Ranger(13)<br>14- Ranger(14)<br>15- Ranger(15) - Improved Critical (Kukri), Favored Enemy 4 (Dragons)<br>16- Ranger(16) - DEX +1 (20)<br>17- Ranger(17)<br>18- Ranger(18) - Power Attack<br>19- Ranger(19)<br>20- Ranger(20) - Favored Enemy 5 (Outsiders), DEX +1 (21)<br>21- Ranger(21) - Bane Of Enemies<br>22- Monk(1)<br>23- Rogue(1)<br>24- Rogue(2) - Epic Weapon Focus (Kukri), DEX +1 (22)<br>25- Rogue(3)<br>26- Rogue(4)<br>27- Rogue(5) - Great Dexterity I (23)<br>28- Rogue(6) - DEX +1 (24)<br>29- Rogue(7)<br>30- Rogue(8) - Great Dexterity II (25)<br>31- Rogue(9)<br>32- Rogue(10) - Improved Evasion, DEX +1 (26)<br>33- Rogue(11) - Great Dexterity III (27)<br>34- Rogue(12)<br>35- Rogue(13) - Crippling Strike<br>36- Rogue(14) - Great Dexterity IV (28), DEX +1 (29)<br>37- Rogue(15)<br>38- Rogue(16) - Blinding Speed<br>39- Rogue(17) - Armor Skin<br>40- Monk(2) - DEX +1 (30)<br><br><br><br><b>SPECIAL NOTES</b><br>If you want a PVP version of this character, swap the Favored Enemies I picked for the core D&amp;D PC races.

My general feeling is that in a PW XP penalties are acceptable, but in a SP mod, not so much.  If there's a limited amount of XP available, you'll end up lower level than you would be otherwise, which is really quite a bad thing.  You could easily do without the monk here.  CoT, for feats and saves, might not be a bad alternative.  If you want to mess w/ your feats, SD could be fun too.<br><br>Personally, I would take a few rogue levels earlier, mostly for the skill dumps.

Still, Epic Dodge is a wonderful feat, I'll consider it, but in terms of "squeezing in feats", I'd like to include Epic Prowess as well. What if I swapped Great Dex 3 and 4 for Epic Prowess and Epic Dodge (swapping Blinding Speed for Defensive Roll)? It would come too late, at level 39, but at least it would be there, and at the cost of only 1 AC!

The +2 racial bonus vs mind spells isn't going to help very much.  Besides, if you really want the +2, go human and take Iron Will with the bonus feat.  Halflings get a +1 to all saves, so it would only be one less anyway.  The fact that elf gives an experience penalty makes it the worst of the three options.  <br><br>There are already several ranger/rogues posted.  Your problem will be the same as theirs.  It isn't possible to get both Bane of Enemies AND Epic Dodge until fairly late in the character's life.  I suggest taking a look at those.  <br><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

You don't need dodge for epic dodge.  It would be worth it to do whatever you have to do to fit it in, even though it may come late.<br><br>I love PA, don't get me wrong, but it's not like the bees knees or anything.  You can't have everything.  It's certainly one of the things I'd think about dropping.  Yeah, most of your damage is in FEs or SAs, but that's pretty much just the way it goes.<br><br>Concerning race, dwarves get ST boni towards spells as well.  As mentioned, you could also pick up Iron Will.  Really though, your will save is gonna suck, and that's about all there is to it.  I wouldn't say elf's the <i>worst</i> choice, as gnome or half-orc is probably worse, but it's definitely not the best.  Almost never is.

@ The Supreme Force<br><br>If I go Halfling, I'll get +1 AC, but avoid XP penalties if I push the monk level further back, but I'll lose the 2 STR, basically I'll swap it with Constitution. I don't much care for XP penalties. That will just mean that I'll need to make one more run through the game or cheat my way to level 40 after I finish HOTU. Plus, you said it yourselves. HOTU is extremely easy, so there's no point in worrying. If I manage to play The Aielund Saga, I'll test the damage that XP penalty can do to my performance and if it is too big, then I'll consider changing race.<br><br>I have seen several Ranger/Rogue/Monks, but none have as much Sneak Attack damage as mine.

Heal would be nice, I guess, but I prefer Discipline. Plus you're not considering the type of items that I'll prioritize. I will certainly get STR enhancing items, if possible (in HOTU it is) I will cap it. And if I were to get rid of concentration, what could I get? Having heal 4 (which is what I get this way) with the take 20 rule will get me through the earlier levels until I have my panther, and after that I have spells/potions.<br><br>Now here's an extract from the HOTU manual on .pdf<br><br>"Epic Dodge<br><br>The caracter avoids all damage from the first attack each round.<br><br>Type of Feat: General<br><br>Prerequisite: 21st level, Dodge, Improved Evasion, Defensive Roll, Tumble 30 ranks, Dexterity 25+<br><br>Use: Automatic."<br><br>Is the manual wrong?

I am not assuming that, I just don't like disable traps, open locks and the rest of the rogue skills. It's easier to send the Animal Companion upfront to get hit by the traps while I follow him in stealth and then bash doors and chests. The spellcraft cross classing could be an option, I guess, but for the same reason that taking elf is a poor choice, so is that IMO. I'd rather resist taunts and be able to cast my spells in combat, although your suggestion could certainly be used. I guess it comes down to preferences in the end, and I prefer to max class skills as a general rule. Same as I prefer to suffer in the earlier levels for more level 40 power while you prefer playability all along. That's just a matter of personal preference. I will make the changes to the build and post it as follows. Thanks for the suggestion, Epic Dodge was a great addition and the cost was low enough, because I was able to squeeze in Eic Prowess as well.<br><br>Take it EZ!

The previous message was for onion eater, obviously, and this one goes to The Supreme Force. I tried to edit the post but I ran out of time <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_mad.gif"> <br><br>I had seen that one, but kamas are worse than Kukris oveall even with the monks extra attacks. Plus he has 10 STR, which is ridiculously low for an already low damage build. The greatest part of his damage comes from SA and FE. I will show you that my guy is a better choice mathematically <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Kukri Damage: 1-4 +2 STR (+bonus damage vs FE), so base damage 3-6 and average damage 4.5. 30% chance of critical (6/20)<br><br>Kama damage: 1-6 +0 STR (+bonus VS FE), so base damage is 1-6 and average damage 3. 10% chance of critical (2/20)<br><br>While I get 100 attacks, the Kama guy will have 116.5 (it's actually 116.66666). I will hit 30 critical hits and he will hit 12 (rounding up).<br><br>So my guy will do 130 X his average damage (4.5) in the same number of rounds that the other guy will do 128.5 X his average damage (3).  Basically, while he does 385.5 damage, my guy will do 585. I love math! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> . <br><br>Of course if you raised the other guy's strength to 14 (which would incur in a penalty to AB), his average damage would go up to 5.5 and he'd do 704 total damage in the same rounds, but he'd have less chances of landing a hit. However, if you notice the pattern, the more damage you include in the proportion (from buffs, items, etc), the 130X VS 128.5X average damage equivalence will favor my character, all else remaining constant <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Take it EZ!

I come up with nothing (since you dont like cleave, and you are using kuks).   If it is skills, rog gets tumble, ranger gets dis.  <br><br>i am wondering if ranger/rog isnt a better option?  I cant even rp a reason for monk with this build!  oh well.<br><br>With a dexer, not havin ED with rogue is not always the best idea, imo.

@ Finneous JP<br><br>My calculations are right, I used 100 as a standard number of attacks. Since the progression of the attacks is 6 with the Kukris to 7 with the Kamas, dividing 100 by 6 you get the number of rounds (16.5 rounded down) that would take for my character to unleash 100 attacks. Since the Kamas get 1 extra attack every round, they'll get 16.5 extra attacks every 100 attacks. <br><br>I could be forgetting to consider other important variables that affect the result, but I'm sure I didn't miscalculate this.

Free cleave is AWESOME. Plus this guy, with his high DEX isn't going to wear any armor, so MONK AC also rox! Plus plus the not-so useful but still nice to have Deflect Arrows! Skillwise, the Monk isn't required because rogue/ranger pretty much cover it, except for the spellcasting ones, which the monk doesn't help with either.<br><br>The updated version of this guy already has ED, and I'm considering a race switch to halfling. Human is out of the question, since I'd have to nerf other stats unnecessarily to achieve DEX 16 in exchange for one extra pre-epic feat that wouldn't do me much good. Maybe the extra skill point would allow me to go int 12 instead of 14, but in the end I prefer +1 to all saves and +1 AC IF I decide to switch races. I am considering and testing as I go. Epic Dodge really improved this guy, now I'll try the switch to Halfling to see how it goes.<br><br>If you think I'm a CHEESER, YOU GOT THAT!!!!! I'm working on another one already, and guess what?

The math may be "right", but it's irrelevant. First, include AC in your calculations. Then, you need to acknowledge the kama gets more attacks at high AB than kukri (due to Flurry).

@ Finneous JP<br><br>Well I tried to, as you said, include AC in the mixture, and here is how I think it'd work:<br><br>1- VS HIGH AC (OVER 80)*<br><br>In this case, where a 20 would be needed to even land a hit, such as a Druid in Dragon Form, the Kamas would do better. They will have one extra attack per round and therefore one extra chance to roll a 20. But I have chosen Power Attack for this kind of situation, so the difference between average damage isn't as big, although it still exists.<br><br>2- VS MEDIUM AC (60-80)<br><br>Considering an attack bonus of around 47 (41 AB + 3 from Blade Thirst +2 from Cat's Grace, +1 from aid, which the Kama guy would also have) I would need 13 or more to hit the lower one, and there I'd have the upper hand, while still needing a 20 to hit the higher ACs, then I'd turn Power attack on. I would say that in this area it begins to even out, with a slight advantage for my build simply for having Power Attack.<br><br>3- VS LOW AC (40-60)<br><br>In this case I would hit too often, and so would the other guy. My estimate would work in this case.<br><br>*It's worth to mention that I'm referring to AC achievable only by buffs, because if you add gear to the mixture, my guy will have the upper hand, since he practically can't buff himself, and is kind of a wimp without scrolls from UMD and general equipment.<br><br>On a side note, the main reason I'm not taking Kamas for this build isn't mathematical. When I had the idea for it, I was already working on a dual wielding Kama build for another character, so I didn't want to overdo it. I like cheese, but not that much!<br><br>Take it EZ!

Yes, you technically dont take a feat for it, but from what i have seen, it is NOT free.  20% xp penalty for one.  [its not you, i just cant stand xp penalties.  On most pw's, xp is HARD earned and to give up 20% or 40% in this case is unthinkable!].  <br><br>So, if i understand it, you arent using Kama, which thax and finn cover.

I did see it Thax, and I liked it, but it's just that the kama dual-wield thing is everywhere. I saw your Mystic Master (Wiz 21, Monk 2, Clr 17), and guess what? DUAL KAMAS! Crispy Critter's Magic Master (or is it backwards?) DUAL KAMAS! I myself, as I told you in PM am building a version of it to play with. I will post something about it shortly on the suggestions topic. or below your own build seeing as it is a version of it with VERY SLIGHT CHANGES, since yours is already almost perfect IMO.<br><br>If Kamas give you 3 extra attacks, then I must bow to your arguments, they are indeed the best choice. Your build is, just like the Magic master, ALMOST perfect. The only 2 changes I would make would be to get 25 set traps early on, go halfling with 12 con and 13 str to get power attack instead of Blind Fight, seeing as you already have Ultravision and Invisibility Purge in your spellbook. You would have to get rid of toughness as well, but 1 more AB and AC is worth it.<br><br>@ avado<br><br>1- where did u get the idea that I don't look at the most experienced players builds? I've seen SEVERAL of Grizzled dwarflord's builds, like that AWESOME pale master one (I would try it if it weren't evil) or one similar to this one, but with SC V. I have seen a few of Thax's too, and Kail's Nature Wyrm, and LOTS of others. I have several stories created for several characters, and whenever I decide to try an idea for one of them, I look at the search engine first.<br><br>2- Where did you get the idea that I play HOTU and SOU 1230283091280974901283 times BY CHOICE instead of trying a different module? I was having problems opening up The Aielund Saga until TODAY. Now thanks to the great help from onion eater IT WORKED!!

@ onion eater<br><br>This guy has very good combos. MASSIVE sneak attack damage from him and his animal companion. I thought he had the most sneak attack damage, but that's because I didn't know how Kama attacks worked. It seems this build is second only to Thax's in that regard. <br><br>I had never before built a rogue, and if you read the previous posts you'll notice that I had the Neverwinter manual as a general guide, so I thought Dodge was required for Epic Dodge. Now I already have NWNWiki added to my favorite home pages. I have already said I will get rid of blinding speed and get Defensive Roll instead, while also dropping two great dexterities to add Epic Prowess and Epic Dodge. <br><br>His AB is only low because Ranger spells are pityful, but if you consider the possibilities that UMD brings, with scrolls of Battletide, Prayer, Bless, plus regular magic items, he will improve like no other. A Wizard can achieve 40 AC easily with spells (+5 from Shadow shield, +20 EMA, +1 MA, +2 double Prot VS alignments, and so on). So gear to a wizard is almost irrelevant in terms of AC, athough it does free up extra spell slots. For this guy, every magical item he acquires will give him a boost, even magical weapons, because blade thirst has a pathetic duration.<br><br>The only reason I haven't posted an updated version of this build is because I'm considering a few changes still. I will ABSOLUTELY go Halfling, but the low saving throws are what's really bothering me. There's no point in making a HUGE DAMAGE DEALER if he'll get killed at first sight of ANY caster. Not just the high-level ones, but ANY caster with 9th level spells or even 7th. <br>I was thinking of dropping monk and going bard (2)instead to max spellcraft. I'd dual-wield Handaxes, and drop weapon proficiency exotic for cleave (yes I would, avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ), and move power attack to the early levels, while pushing back Weapon Focus Handaxe.<br><br>I have searched for a build of this kind using the search engine and came up with only 2 different ones, but both focused mainly on the Bard part.

You don't want to dual-wield handaxes with a halfling.  Due to their small size, halflings can only use tiny weapons dagger/kukri) in their off-hand without receiving the hefty penalty to AB. <br><br>Also, if your concern was saving throws, ranger/rogue really wasn't the way to go in the first place.  Just accept that your Will save is going to be pathetic and live with it.  Hope that you can find potions to help against mind spells, or that there are plenty of useful scrolls for you to use.

Ok, noted, no handaxes then. <br><br>But I could swap monk for bard, lose cleave, get +8 saves due to spellcraft and + AB, damage and will saving throws from the bard song. The flurry isn't being used because of the Kukris, and If I were to go with the Kamas, my build would just be too similar to Thax's (not that it's a bad thing by any means) but really I'd like to try something different than the cheese, maybe some ham? <br><br>I will lose some melee power from not choosing the Kamas/monk cheese build, but at the same time solving one of the main weaknesses of the ranger/rogue combination. Altogether it's not that bad IMO. Saying as onion eater put it. What would your build do that others don't? It'd be a ranger / rogue combination with decent saving throws. I can't go daggers because they're not slashing, so Blade Thirst would be useless. My choices are to either go human and have mediocre starting stats to achieve 16 DEX or take exotic weapons for the kukri halfling. I'll revise the feats to see where I could squeeze in cleave.<br><br>Take it EZ!<br><br>* Actually, cleave might not be a good idea, with such a low damage output.

In my opinion, you're just thinking your stats are cool and mighty just because you made the build. There's no big deal, I do that all the time, but truth be told, when I played my build I actually had a pretty rough time. Early on your damage sucks since you don't get sneaks or BoE or even the cheese until epics for the sake of BAB so after testing it's really meant to start at about level 30, that's why I posted it as a level 40 build. Playing this kind of build requires more Rogue-style skill than what I'm capable of (I'm a melee-buffer or caster type of player, I've never been really good with the hiding stuff), so it's one of the hardest builds I've played (considering I don't play with crappy builds), at least it's a lot weaker than my usual playthrough builds.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/27/08 20:02</span></i></p>

So Thax, basically, this build type does not suit your playing style, which is ok. You and I have somewhat similar tastes, but still a little different. I had already seen your kama build and liked it before I made mine, but I really forgot about it somehow (probably because I was actually working on something else when this idea hit me) when I decided to post it (plus, once I was reminded of your build, I thought I was improving it because I didn't know how Kamas worked). Still there was always something bothering me about the low saves.<br><br>I began considering the idea of a change when one of you guys (I think it was avado) said I had absolutely no reason to go monk, since I wasn't using most of his cheese anyway. That's when I had the idea of adding bard to the mixture, instead of monk, but my main issue is that I have NEVER played with a bard before, so I don't know it's intricacies, that's why I asked you guys to give me your opinions. I'm not going to make a better build than the Kama one, that is more than certain, but a more well-rounded one, or at least that's what I'm aiming for now.<br><br>Tell me, if I maintain the Kukris, do you think Bard would be a good choice for a third class? If not, please tell me why. What are my other options?<br><br>Take it EZ!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Maximillian Kane on 12/27/08 22:20</span></i></p>

Bard is usually taken for skilldumps, which becomes useless as Rogue already has a very good skillset.<br><br>What you want is a class that needs only a few levels to make itself useful (because Bane of Enemies and Sneak Attack suck all your levels already). So, not much in there to pick, 4 Fighter levels would be my choice, but 1 Shadowdancer might be the best.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Fighter doesn't have spellcraft, so it wouldn't do the trick, and I believe shadowdancer doesn't either. Druid, wizard, Sorc, Cleric are classes that don't matter much in low levels. Bard was pretty much the only class that could fit in the mixture with more effectiveness. Bardic Lore will be useless, since it's only 2 levels, but he'd have spellcraft as a class skill and his song to improve my guy's attack. I wouldn't be able to use the spells, however, as my charisma is too low already.<br><br>I will test adding bard and see how it goes. Geez, I really gotta start making some decisions!! If it doesn't work out then I'll just give up and go monk with dual kamas, making the very few adjustments to thax's build to fit it to my preferences. <br><br>Take it EZ!

I think you are hiding behind the saves to delay the inevitable... you have a build!  lol  i know its crazy but you do!  Accept it.  it is what it is.

HIPS stands for Hide in Plain Sight, it's an ability gained with 1 Shadowdancer level and it's self-explanatory so you can guess it's very powerful.

Hello guys,<br><br>After a while of playing with another build, I resumed my work on this one, and I think I was able to improve it quite a bit. It didn't lose much, gained 4 AC, lost 1 AB, but gained a temporary buff that restores it and adds 1 to damage as well. Yes avado, it is still a 3 base class build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    .<br><br>Here's the result:<br><br>THE SILENT DEATH DEALER<br><br>Ranger (21) / Bard (2) / Rogue (17)<br><br>RACE: Human<br><br>ALIGNMENT: Chaotic Neutral (Any nonlawful)<br><br>STARTING STATS:<br><br>STR - 14 (+2)<br>DEX - 14 (+2)<br>CON - 10 (0)<br>WIS - 14 (+2)<br>INT - 14 (+2)<br>CHA - 12 (+1)<br><br>ENDING STATS:<br><br>STR - 14 (+2)<br>DEX - 26 (+8)<br>CON - 10 (0)<br>WIS - 14 (+2)<br>INT - 14 (+2)<br>CHA - 12 (+1)<br><br>BASIC STATS:<br><br>Hit Points: 324<br><br>Skill Points: 369<br><br>Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 22/24/18 (+8 VS Spells, Improved Evasion)<br><br>Naked AC: 28 <br><br>BAB: 30<br><br>AB (dual wield mundane handaxes): 40<br><br>Spellcasting: Ranger (21)<br><br>LEVELING GUIDE:<br><br>1- Ranger (1) - Power Attack, Cleave, Favored Enemy 1 (Undead)<br>2- Ranger (2)<br>3- Ranger (3) - Weapon Focus (Handaxe)<br>4- Ranger (4) - DEX +1 (15)<br>5- Ranger (5) - Favored Enemy 2 (Constructs)<br>6- Ranger (6) - Knockdown, Animal Companion (Panther)<br>7- Ranger (7)<br>8- Ranger (8) - DEX +1 (16)<br>9- Ranger (9) - Improved Critical (Handaxe)<br>10- Ranger (10) - Favored Enemy 3 (Elementals)<br>11- Ranger (11)<br>12- Ranger (12)- Improved Knockdown, DEX +1 (17)<br>13- Ranger (13)<br>14- Ranger (14)<br>15- Ranger (15) - Weapon Finesse, Favored Enemy 4 (Dragons)<br>16- Ranger (16) - DEX +1 (18)<br>17- Ranger (17)<br>18- Ranger (18) - Expertise<br>19- Ranger (19)<br>20- Ranger (20) - Favored Enemy 5 (Outsiders), DEX +1 (19)<br>21- Rogue (1) - Epic Weapon Focus (Handaxe)<br>22- Rogue (2)<br>23- Rogue (3)<br>24- Rogue (4)- Epic Prowess, DEX +1 (20)<br>25- Rogue (5)<br>26- Rogue (6)<br>27- Rogue (7) - Armor Skin<br>28- Rogue (8) - DEX +1 (21)<br>29- Rogue (9)<br>30- Rogue (10) - Improved Evasion, Great Dexterity I (22)<br>31- Rogue (11)<br>32- Rogue (12) - DEX +1 (23)<br>33- Rogue (13) - Defensive Roll, Great Dexterity II (24)<br>34- Rogue (14)<br>35- Rogue (15) <br>36- Rogue (16) - Crippling Strike, Epic Dodge, DEX +1 (25)<br>37- Rogue (17)<br>38- Bard (1) <br>39- Ranger (21) - Bane Of Enemies<br>40- Bard (2) - DEX +1 (26)<br><br>SPECIAL NOTES: If you want a PVP version of this character, swap the Favored Enemies I picked for the core D&amp;D PC races.

I still don't see the point of a third class here unless it's a prestige.  Assassin gets spellcraft at no XP penalty and also gets you death attack (instant win if your opponent rolls a 1).  Shadowdancer gives you HiPS.<br><br>Also, you pretty much never need UMD more than around 30 or so.  Not even to use a race-restricted suit of armor +10 with 4 or 5 different bonuses.  If you do need more, chances are your environment is so high-magic it puts local vault uberl337 h4xors to shame.  You also don't need any concentration at all, there's pretty much nothing you need to cast in combat and taunt can be avoided by running from combat when they use it on you.  Maxing out Set Trap (to get higher DC) or taking Listen is a better investment.<br><br>How I would change the build (keeping the basic premise intact):<br><br>Go human or dwarf<br>Do stats something like this:<br><br>STR 14<br>DEX 16 (everything into DEX)<br>CON 14 (16 if dwarf)<br>INT 10<br>WIS 14<br>CHA 8 (6 if dwarf)<br><br>Power attack and cleave are a waste of feats for you.  If you're up against a PM, you're not going to hit him, period.  And even if you do, once in a blue moon, 5 damage isn't going to make a difference.  Cleave simply doesn't get you much return (I've had this argument before with almost everyone here, and I still stand by my statement that if you get to use Cleave on a regular basis, the enemies are too weak to pose you a threat anyway).<br><br>Now, dodge and mobility on the other hand <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">        Take them at 15 and 18 so you can get SD at level 22-ish.  This also frees you up another level of ranger so you can get Bane of Enemies as soon as you hit epics and still get a discipline skill dump (I'd still keep discipline, if only "just in case" if you get caught flat-footed or somesuch).<br><br>Expertise...  Since you now have HiPS, you don't need it - if you ever need a situation where the enemy can't hit you, just hide.  Take a saving-throw boosting feat instead.<br><br><b>Conclusion:</b><br>- You gain HiPS (yay!)<br>- You get Bane of Enemies much earlier (level 21 vs. 39)<br>- You can attack someone from stealth, not only getting a lot of sneak attack but also get a better chance to KD them since they're going to be flat-footed<br>- You only get +4 saves vs. spells from spellcraft, but you can take a feat pre-epic to cancel out some of that<br><br>PS: since your DEX is now 2 points higher, consider swapping out two Greater Dexterity feats for ESF: Discipline and Epic Fortitude or Epic Will (imo Will is more useful, characters with devcrit pose you less of a threat since you have both HiPS and Epic Dodge).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bertuzzi on 01/09/09 03:36</span></i></p>

Go see for yourself. I was in the Sneaky Dragon discussion arguing that he should get SD 5, maybe you confused it. OH! And please don't murder the english language, it's desperation, not despiration <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  <br><br>2- Tell me, please, ONE prestige class that has Spellcraft as a class skill and is accessible in this build. It also needs to be one that I can take only 2 levels in and benefit from it as much as I do from the Bard, regardless of XP penalty. If you took BoE at level 21, which I haven't at all discarded, you could delay the XP penalty to level 39 by saving up Epic Prowess or Armor Skin to be taken that late. The ONLY reason I took that last level of Ranger so late was actually a mistake of mine: I thought that Bards didn't get Discipline as a class skill. Since this was previously a Monk build, I thought I now needed to delay Ranger to get Max discipline. My mistake, I will correct it shortly.<br><br>BTW, there is no Downside to bard. 20% XP penalty for (if reduced) 1 or 2 levels isn't really something to be worried about. Plus, Bard gets Discipline (I know now) and Concentration as class skills, so you can Max them out. I want Spellcraft because this guy's will save is PATHETIC (18). At least with Spellcraft he doesn't have to HOPE FOR IMMUNITIES. I do realize that a pure caster's DC would still be hard to resist (even counting items, like a Protection from Spells scroll), but the odds go up a lot this way. I found a way to diminish one of this character's main weaknesses at the cost of 20% XP in two levels. To me that's not bad at all. If there indeed is a PrC that can get spellcraft and improve this character, I'm not completely against the change, but from what I could see, there wasn't.<br><br>3- Dude, do you really think I do this to try to get your respect? In fact it's the exact opposite. I am a very intelligent guy. Intelligent enough to realize that you guys know a lot more about this game and it's strategies than I do. By posting builds or ideas and discussing them with you guys, the builds get better and I grow as a builder. I have improved A LOT since I started doing this and hope to continue doing so. I am not arrogant enough to think that in a month I've been doing this I could even begin to make up for the 5 or 6 years that some of you guys have had of experience. That does not mean that I will accept everyone's claims and disregard my own ideas without a proper reason. Even among you people there isn't a unanimous build. Some people like some, others don't. That's just the way it is. I have noticed you're a little bit of a PrC (and Cleric) freak <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">     . If you think that the only way to achieve a creative build is by going Blackguard / Shadowdancer / Red Dragon Disciple, that's fine. I beg to differ. <br><br>Just a few more things that I'd like you to know:<br><br>- This was my FIRST Rogue and Bard build EVER (not together, I mean separately I had never used either class in any of my builds before)<br><br>- There was a long time lapse in which I didn't play this game because of the glitches (alas I didn't know about Tony K's AI, CEP, EMS or even downloadable modules) This is sort of a "rebirth" for me at this game.<br><br>- I am going to try to play this guy through the Aielund Saga, and see what tweaks are needed, and then post a final version (with BoE at 21st level) as soon as I'm done.<br><br>Take it EZ!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Maximillian Kane on 01/09/09 11:15</span></i></p>

*peers closely*  Well, lookit that, he is a human...<br><br>For what it's worth, I have no problem w/ the bard levels late in the build.  Yes, three base classes is somewhat inelegant, and IMO, a skill dump at the end of the build is a waste, but if you're going for level 40 play, even if you have to work your way up, the bard levels at least get the job done.  Like I say, rather inelegant (and, yes, elegance is something I look for in a build), and it wouldn't work for me, within the parameters, it's fine.<br><br>That said, I do agree that SD would be a more worthwhile investment.  You could easily get BoE early, a ranger dump later, two rogue bonus feats, and SD.  You'd lose spellcraft.<br><br>And, seriously?  You're putting four points into CHA for...  one potential first level spell casting... woah.  No.  Really, really no.  Mindboggling bad idea.

I have just spent some time working on an idea (i was the sounding board) for a build that takes 2 base classes (non-human) with NO xp penalty, and TONS of more options in store than BoE and spellcraft 40! (by taking Bard, that is what you are saying IS important to you).  <br><br>Honestly, this is an old game and an old guild.  You really need to DESIGN a build to get some interest.  THe scary thing is that you REDID the build and STILL made mistakes..  I am not one for perfection, as i have never left a build without alterations on the fly, but man...<br><br>at the end of the day, we have gone on for 4 pages on a build that isnt that inspired, and never was, yet the designer has tried to defend it all the way through and made a worse build in the end than what he started with.. hmm  EPIC builder?

Here's the deal: Shadowdancer with 20 cross-classed Spellcraft is better than Bard here. The +4 you get vs. spells isn't gonna make a difference. I'll be frank: the spellcraft bonus isn't going to save you vs. Will saves, not cross-classed. not as a class skill. Not spells, and esp. not effects (Fear auras come to mind...)<br><br>A simple example, Prismatic Dragon CR 30-something - less than 40 anyway - casts prismatic spray with 40 DC for confuse. And you'll be encountering even tougher enemies at lvl 40-ish.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;meatpimp<br><br>Pish tosh.

@ Finn (It's about time I start shortening your name)<br><br>Thanks for the feedback, but there is a problem. I kind of agree that SD would be a VERY good choice, however I would need to drop 2 feats to get it (Dodge and Mobility pre-requisites). I could drop Expertise, although I think it's a bad idea, I love Epertise. So to get SD for HiPS I would need to give up on 2 of the feats + Max Spellcraft + delay BoE to the 39th level (again*) to be able to MAX Discipline, because it's not a SD class skill. <br><br>*Please remember that it was a mistake that made me delay taking BoE in this second version, so naturally, now that I know Discipline is a Bard class skill, I will without a doubt get BoE at level 21, delaying either Armor Skin or Epic Prowess. Therefore, the corrected split would be:<br><br>Ranger - 21, Rogue - 17, Bard - 2 (at 39 and 40 only would I have XP penalties in this new split). Power attack, Cleave, WF, IC, KD and IKD are extremely important for this build IMO, so Expertise would be the only one on the "nice to have list".<br><br>Using your same example. My base Save VS the Prismatic Dragon's Confuse would be 26 (as opposed to 22 in the SD alternative). With a Protection From Spells Scroll (a MUST in this build) it'd go up to 34. Either a Scarab of Protection +5 or a Cloak of Fortification +5 would be enough for me to fail only on a natural 1, while the other build would need both (still pretty reasonable to assume that you can get both these items in a level 40 build), but I would have a clear item slot for say... An amulet of Natural Armor +5.<br><br>Don't think I don't understand what you guys are saying (especially you avado), it's just a personal thing: I play only Single Player mods, and therefore I am THE MAIN HERO AND SAVIOR OF ALL. I hate the fact that whenever a creature with Fear Aura appears, my guy has to hope for immunities or run like there's no tomorrow while his henchmen do the fighting for him.<br><br>I do realize it's unquestionable that he becomes MUCH BETTER at what he does by going Shadowdancer as a third class, but for once I'd like to be able to face a Dragon without running off in fear or hoping for a Cowl of Warding. To me it's like saying: this guy is only playable in environments with immunities. Maybe for PWs that works fine if you're in a party you just let everyone else do the fighting for you, but in Single Player mods where you are the center of the whole thing, to me it's pointless to simply accept that he's just vulnerable to mind spells and that's it. <br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  If there is a build I ever regret spending my time on it's this one, but alas I already started it and I always finish what I start. I will post the corrected vrsion of it shortly, but for now I'm still considering dropping Charisma to 8 and going Constitution 14 as onion eater suggested. Or even rearranging some of my stats (getting STR 13 and INT 13 to qualify for Power Attack and Expertise, going CON 12, CHA 8 and starting with 16 DEX)<br><br>Take it EZ!

Here's a flaw with that reasoning: you only gain that +8 bonus to spellcraft (and the resulting +4 advantage) at level 39 and 40 when you take your bard levels, right?  That's potentially 38 levels of will save sucking with no spellcraft bonus at all.<br><br>Frankly, I'd suggest getting Protection from Alignment, Lesser Mind Blank, or Mind Blank and just be flat out immune to mind spells (though only evil or good with PfA).

In brief:<br><br>Sure, spellcraft is great, but you will still need to be finding yourself fear immunity, and whatnot.  What if that fear aura isn't the result of a spell?  Your will save sucks, and you better find a way to cover for that, and that way aint spellcraft.<br><br>I don't see why PA and cleave are integral to the build.  I can barely accept imp crit, though I suppose it's more than worthwhile.<br><br>You could easily swap bard for SD, and still get BoE at 21st, <i>and</i> take another ranger for a discipline dump.  That's a stronger build.  Don't get me wrong, I love bards, and I think that bard in this build isn't an entirely awful idea (though IMO your first skill dump at 37 is all but useless)*, just, well, HiPS vs. spellcraft...  oh, ok, and having to take dodge and mobility.  Still, no contest.  HiPS wins, by a cool bit.<br><br>*and this is what I don't understand.  You say you play only single player mods.  Surely you don't walk around at level 40 the vast majority of the time?  How many mods even take you to 40?  Why build for 40 when you're never going to reach that point?  I don't understand it at all, and when I see level 40 builds, honestly I immediate discount them.  It is, IMO, of course, a silly thing to do.  Fun, perhaps, as amusement, but totally lacking in practicality.

Any particular reason for 6 heal?  Putting that in, say, Open lock would allow you to open anything with 35 DC or less unbuffed, and up to 41 DC with dexterity capped.

In this build I would only start dual-wielding at level 12, before that either a shield / longsword or scimitar or a two-handed weapon would be the best chouce to go with, none are finesseable.

Maybe if you start with 16 DEX, you could drop 1 Great Dexterity for it, but me, I prefer to get STR enhancing items in this case, you increase your damage as well as your Discipline checks and don't need to waste a feat. Another possibility is lowering CON to 10 instead of lowering STR, but I advise against that since his HP total is already too low for a meleer.<br><br>3- I don't think I'm misinformed, unless the manual and D&amp;D books are wrong or they adapted it differently to NWN:<br><br>FE 1 - +1 attack and damage against 1 creature type;<br>FE 2 - +2 attack and damage against 2 creature types;<br>FE 3 - +3 attack and damage against 3 creature types;<br>FE 4 - +4 attack and damage against 4 creature types;<br>FE 5 - +5 attack and damage against 5 creature types;<br>BoE - +2 attack and +2d6 damage VS all FEs.<br><br>Total: +7 to attack and + (2d6+5) to damage VS all FEs<br><br>Is it not how it works in NWN?<br><br>P.S: I think you get save bonuses as well, at least on D&amp;D you do <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> .<br><br>Take it EZ!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Maximillian Kane on 01/11/09 19:18</span></i></p>

Never saw this answered, so, no darkvision will not give you any boni in magical darkness.  It helps you see when you're in dark caves and such, and as much as I appreciate that, the gamma slider does that for free...  Still, for my own personal reasons, I'd prefer not to do that.  Anyways, as far as I know, there's no big practical reason to go after darkvision.<br><br>Also, regardless of whether there's another FE group that you might want, taking another adds to damage versus all, so that sounds like a good deal to me.

If you're a shadowdancer, you don't need to cast in melee.  All you need to do is hide, walk away and recast.<br><br>Also while we're at it, then Extend Spell would be nicer - it makes your Blade Thirst last twice as long, and 4 minutes is usually plenty long for any battle.<br><br>This way you can decrease your INT quite a bit.

3 heal is all you need with a +1 healing kit to beat a DC of 26.  If you have a +3 kit, you only need 1 heal.  If you have a +4 or better kit, you don't need any.

I might love skills more than most, but there's no way my ranger/Rogues get enough skillpoints. So I would stick to 14 INT. If you get excess, then learn to set traps etc. I understand the need to min/max, but for a PvM build at least, it's good as is.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Now I must ask you again: what do we do about the title? It shows the ancient beginning of things when it was still monk rgr rog. Should I post the final version like I did with the Holy Weapon Master With Cheese?<br><br>Take it EZ!

I just try to pretend that this thread is in the discussion forum, as normally, builds posted here don't have six pages of rewrites, ending as something so drastically different.
