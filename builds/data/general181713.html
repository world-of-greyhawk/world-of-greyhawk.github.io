How does critical hits and sneak attack damage work? If you have 20d6 sneak attack damage and land a critical hit with a X2 multiplier does it multiply all your sneak attack damage? So say max damage with 20d6 is 120 damage with a critical hit it would be 240?

I would say that it does actually...at least some of it. Try scoring a crit with a sneak attack, right out of stealth and make another character, which does not have sneak attack dmg and do the same thing. I really believe the dmg differs

The bonus damage from sneak attack does not get multiplied by a critical hit, but the regular damage does.  E.g. say you have a rogue that does 10+1D6 (+10D6 sneak attack) with a short sword.  If he gets a critical hit, he'll do 20+2D6+(10D6 sneak attack).  Believe me, if sneak attack damage was multiplied the only characters you would see would be scythe wielding STR based rogue/weapon masters.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 02/20/05 10:13</span></i></p>

I know what you mean Mith, but after seeing alot of sneakers on Bastions of War critting insane dmg out from sneak and calculating a bit on the weapons dmg, it appears odd that the is extra dmg from something. That is why Im not sure...if anyone could test it, we could be sure.
