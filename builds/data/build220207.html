Maybe a reason you died is those horrible, horrible starting stats? You aren't a ranger. You're not going to get any spells. Leave WIS at 14. Is Black Orc just a human with the subrace filled in? So he doesn't get STR bonuses? Why are you raising CHA at all? Are Orcs even meant to be pretty?<br><br>Start with something like:<br>STR: 16<br>DEX: 12<br>CON: 16<br>INT: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Also those feats... Forget Exotics and just use a Battleaxe if you want the look. Get your WF earlier! I don't like weirdo Orcs wielding Dwarven Waraxes! Blasphemy!<br><br>Delay Expertise/Imp Expertise until later if it's really necessary. I'd say get Pow ATT/ Cleave on your first level, then Weapon Focus, IKD and Blind Fight next and last of all, Imp Disarm if you really want it. I'd say drop the Initiative feats and possibly have the level spread as Fighter 16/ Barb 24 to get a little more Barb DR, HP and top off with one Epic Barb Feat and get the rages which you haven't even included (Terrifying Rage at least! What's a wimpy barbarian who can't even scare things?!)<br><br>Also, how'd you get 46 Discipline unless that's modified ranks? We need base ranks here and if you want to list modified, do it after the base ranks. I'd Cross Class Tumble all the way to 20 drop Concentration and Spellcraft and probably put in one points max each in Open Locks/Disable Traps and use gear. Really though, you're a Barbarian. You've got Uncanny Dodge (later, + to saves vs. Traps) and high STR. Just hit the things you can't open!<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:. Only those who have known darkness in<br>(OvO) their hearts will see the shadows in life...<br>(|__|)<br>..".."..
