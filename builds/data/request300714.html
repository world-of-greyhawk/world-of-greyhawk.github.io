Looking for a good Paladin with a decent AB and the ability to Smite for a high magic server,+20 weapons are possible<br>as you can use gems to enhance up to +20. Level 40 chac.<br><br>I know you have to give a little on either CHA or AB, But would prefer a higher AB. ALso would like Decent AC. HOpe I am not asking for too much. Race does not matter, however alignment shifts are not possible.<br><br>Thanks

I guess you want Great Smiting, which in turn means Paladin/CoT. You can then add WM, FTR or Rogue for example (rogue having +4 AC not to say trap skills and UMD). You'll probably end up with a 37-39 mundane AB. Is that good enough for you?<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

Thanks for the reply Kail, I went back and look thru the Chac builds and found.....  Ithacan's  Knight of the Sword,(Pally/WM/COT). This should work for me, CHA is only 14 but I forgot that there are Ability gems around to increase so that will help.<br> <br><br>Again thanks for the help,
