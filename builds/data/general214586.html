Hey guys/gals.  I have ignored this aspect of nwn for long enough.  I finally figured out tumble and such, but what I'm wondering is, what makes up the rest of the AC?<br><br>I mean, what are the types (natural, shield, dodge, deflecition?)  and how high to they each go to?  Max for each, etc.<br><br>I finally got around to modifying a cleric/bard/pm build that I was contemplating and I am excited about having a 47/51 AC at lv 21 BEFORE I add the pm lvls!  But Im trying to figure out how to BEST set up my equipment so I can get the best ac bang for my buck, so to speak.<br><br>I know this was sort of discussd in a build posted here, Im just hoping someone has all the details.<br><br>Thanks for any help.<br><br>Peace<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 09/29/05 06:38</span></i></p>

The maximum you can have is +20. The only one that stacks with the same type is Dodge.<br><br>Natural can be found on ammys.<br>Armor is, well, on armor and bracers.<br>Shield is found - you guessed it - on shields.<br>Dodge is found on boots.<br>Deflection is found on rings and cloaks.<br><br>The +4 AC from Haste is Dodge AC.<br><br>If you have two (or more) items that give you Dodge AC (+4 and +6, for example), they stack (to give +10 Dodge AC). No other type will stack with itself.<br><br>The Dodge AC bestowed by every 5 ranks in Tumble does not count towards the cap.<br><br>Armor Skin does not count towards the stacking restriction or the cap. Nor does the AC bestowed by PM or RDD levels.<br><br>AC acquired from Bard Song is Dodge.<br>AC acquired from Divine Shield is Dodge.<br><br>AC acquired from Expertise/Improved Expertise is a separate AC and doesn't count towards any caps (AFAIK).<br><br>If you have two or more items (other than Dodge) of the same type of enhancement (Deflection, for example), only the highest enhancement applies. The lower ones are ignored (or overwritten, but the effect is the same - only the highest applies).<br><br>If you are flat-footed, you lose all your Dodge AC (including from Tumble ranks and Haste) as well as your DEX-based AC unless you have Uncanny Dodge, in which case you keep your DEX-based AC, but will still lose your Dodge AC. Monk AC bestowed by WIS and Monk levels is not lost when flat-footed, nor does it count towards any cap.<br><br>Touch attacks ignore Armor, Natural, and Shield AC. Dodge, DEX, and Deflection AC is effective vs touch attacks.<br><br>That's all I can think of offhand.

Glad to help. I feel I should clarify one point, in case there's a misinterpretation:<br><br>I said the maximum you can have is +20 AC, but that means the maximum of each <i>type</i> of AC, not overall.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
