I thought I'd break this forum's virginity with one of my favorite pnp D&amp;D classes, the bladesinger.<br><br>Starting its a wizard elf<br>Ending levels are Wizard 15/Fighter 5/Bladesinger 20<br>Stats:<br>STR 12-&gt; 14<br>DEX 16<br>CON 12<br>INT 16-&gt; 24<br>WIS 10<br>CHA 10<br><br>Skills are:<br>Concentration 43<br>Discipline 43<br>Lore 43 (need lore for prc epic spells which is more like pnp epic spells, maxing it with int what it is means 5 spells per day)<br>Spellcraft 43 (again need max to learn epic spellsplus the usual reasons)<br>Spot 20<br>Taunt 13 (leftovers)<br>Tumble 40<br><br>Feats (in no particular order..ok its alphabetical):<br>Armor skin, blind fight, cleave, combat casting, dodge, empower spell, epic spell focus illusion (as well as reg and greater), Epic spell penetration (again the previous two as well), Epic (and regular) weapon focus rapier, Epic (and Regular) weapon specialization rapier, expertise, improved combat casting, improved critical rapier, improved (and regular) disarm, mobility, power attack, still spell, toughness, weapon finesse. End result is a fairly nice melee mage hybrid a bladesinger is supposed to be. Spells are a mix of illusions and buffs.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Lockindal on 08/05/04 10:01</span></i></p>

Yea, im liking the new melee mage type classes in PRC.<br><br>But personally i prefer eldritch knight over bladsinger, as they get the same BAB as a fighter and also get 1:1 spells per day, per lvl.<br><br>Also dont forget the practised spellcaster feat:- can be useful if u got a spare feat.<br><br>"Specifics: Your caster level for the chosen class increase by +4. This can't increased your caster level beyond your HD. (Ex: a Fighter 2 / Wizard 5 increase his caster level from 5 to 7). <br><br>Use: Automatic.

I went bladesinger because ever since i's appearance as a kit in 2nd ed dnd, I loved the idealogy of it. I also like the mechanics of it in 3rd ed. The AC boost is awesome if you build it right, and the caster level isn't to bad. Plus this build can cast quite a few epic spells if you have the xp and the gold to research. It really is ahorse a piece though with choosing between the two.

I've been experimenting with 16th level builds for starting HotU (I know that 15 is the normal starting level, but a lot of class combinations hit some magic threshhold at 16), testing them in "Novice to Epic Character Maker" and your build is pretty similar to my latest.<br><br>I dropped CHA to 8 though and started with 14 STR.<br><br>At 16th level I've got Wiz 2/Fighter 4/Bladesinger 10.  It needs some feat tweaking I think -- IIRC I don't actually have any extended spells memorized other than Death Armor, which isn't really worth it anyway. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>The old green dragon, pit fiend, and bebilith -- usually the ones that present the biggest challenges and/or annoyances to a 16th level character -- are all no problem.  Took them out easier than the other two strong builds I've found, the Cleric/Hospitaler and Monk/SD/DoM.  (I had a Cleric/Lich build in there too, but it turned out to be far less effective in actual play than I'd have expected. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"> )<br><br>The only other thing I could want would be the ability to wear Monk robes and boots. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   But a Bard/Fighter/Bladesinger would miss the good buffing spells and a Wiz/Rogue/Bladesinger wouldn't be able to reach +5 BAB in 6 levels to squeeze in all 10 Bladesinger levels, and considering how powerful Song of Fury is I don't think I'd want to make the sacrifice. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">
