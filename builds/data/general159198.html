I'm building a Cleric/CoT/monk build and right now I stand on taking 20 cleric, 18 CoT, and 2 Monk. Are there any advantages of going 21 cleric, 18 CoT, and 1 monk? I figured there weren't any so I might as well go 2 monk and get deflect arrows. Let me know what you guys think.

Not that I can think of, other then an epic spell on that cleric level. what type of cleric is it? With C.O.T in it its probably a melee build, so don't think an epic spell is apropiate.

Why are you taking so many cleric levels? With that many COT levels i guess you're a melee fighter. You can do with 17 (or even 15, if you don't need any 9 level spells). Take 6 monk levels to get IKD.

It's a zen archery build. I didn't want to go melee because I was sick and tired of killing myself on mages' shields. I took so many lvls of CoT to max out my ab pre-epic and also to make my fort savings throw high enough to fend off any dev crit. I know I waste a feat because I have to have weapon focus in a melee weapon but CoT gets so many bonus feats it made up for it.

You're probably best off how you're planning to build it right now. I assume you're grabbing Monk for your first level and your 37th level so as to get your Tumble to 40 ranks.<br><br>BTW...you might consider investing in the Auto Silent Spell feats. This will let you cast Silence on yourself to neutralize nearby casters, while still letting you cast spells.<br>_________________<br>(sig space for rent)
