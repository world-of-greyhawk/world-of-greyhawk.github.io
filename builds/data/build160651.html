I got only one suggestion - take weap finesse earlier (swap this with dodge maybe?) unless you plan on using only a bow, and no melee until lvl 36.

Whats your damage per hit?  Thats always my concern with AA builds.  So many look great but you take them 'outside' where you have DR items ect and all you see in a bunch of golden zeros poping up.  Any Barb, DD or Epic DR feat Char with a good 10DR belt will just laugh and ignore you till all your friends are dead.<br><br>However, I love the speed, AC and AB; all great.  Now if only you can hurt them.... Maybe arrows with some positve energy or other odd damage (Sonic ect...)

well i posted above the damage with bow.. its +15<br>Kama just +2, unless you max your STR then its +8<br>Most servers will have a bow with +5 mighty though, you dont do AS much as you would if you were STR based using normal weapons but, its still a good amount.<br>Way i see it, as far as archers go, its pretty good

1. With 29AA levels why do you ever want to melee? Take this away and you can dispense with the useless Parry skill and save on feats too.<br><br>2. For AA damage you want a composite bow with the Mighty attribute. This suggests a boost in STR would be beneficial.<br><br>3. With a Monk/AA I wonder whether boosting Wisdom and taking the Zen Archery feat wouldn't be more apposite. You would have a handy name then too (e.g. Ultimate Zen Archer). Gives you decent Will saves too.<br><br>4. Do you really need all those skill points in Heal? Hide/Move Silently could have some benefits.<br><br>5. When taking the Wizard level take 10 points in Spellcraft to add +2 to saves against spells.<br><br>6. 10 levels of Monk is not optimal, maybe one less early on and a second Wiz at level 20 (boosting Spellcraft) might be better.

For instance you could be fighting someone that could smack the crap outta you but has low AC (meaning tank fighters lol).

No, no. I'm not suggesting for a moment that you don't max tumble. You just misread my post. You have to take a further level of Monk at the end. The question really is should you stop there or take another 3 levels and get SR, immunity to poison and an extra attack on your flurry (at a cost of +1 to attack with bow), or take another level of Wiz and max your Spellcraft and get an extra spell (at no cost as far as I can see).

No save, but SR works (unfortunately each missile has to be resisted individually).<br><br>Still, no AA build has a chance against an IGMS spamming arcane caster regardless. With empowered and maximised as well and Epic MA and Warding, it's only possible for other spellcasters to beat such a character.<br><br>Equally almost any build will kick Monster ***.<br><br>The question therefore is: Is the build "maximised" - using these classes can you do better, or is there another class that could substitute successfully for one of these? I think that it's clear that substituting the last level of AA for one of Wizard brings an improvement to the build in any world where you get potions of Heal/CCW/CSW. In a world where you don't get these, then it's likely that the build will lack in strength = damage.<br><br>The ability to parry with kamas appears to add no strength to the build - it does nothing against spellcasters or AA builds, or monk builds. Or rogue based builds either. Or DD builds with a high DR. Even against STR melee builds, on low magic worlds you'll get killed by dev crit, and on medium magic worlds the kamas will never do any damage.<br><br>Have you actually tried the build out in PvP?

Have you considered substituting rogue for monk? yes you lose the wisdom ac bonus, but you gain use magic device, uncanny dodge, and if you take 10 rogue levels a rogue special feat.<br><br>on a build like that you can drop wis to a solid 12 and take great will and luck of heroes as feats, giving you a +3 will save and +2 to fort and reflex, and giving you something to do with two pre epic feats that often end up being used for buggy, debatably useful things like blind fight (sure it SEEMS like a good idea...)<br><br>if you build for a server with no GOOD dex boost items, I do recommend starting at 20 dex, and shooting for the full 40 dex at 40th..the extra BAB comes in handy when you cant find enough items to get the full +12 dex buff NWN allows.<br><br>Also, on a server where you can get the full +12 ride, that puts you squarely to 52 (FIFTY TWO) dexterity at level 40 with items..<br><br>With a build of 10 rogue levels, which grants you dodge, mobility, evasion, improved evasion, uncanny dodge and a rogue only feat such as defensive roll, there is very very little out there that can seriously hurt you as long as you stay out of melee...but as an archer you have no business getting into melee anyway.<br><br>Another good base is the much ignored bard. just 3 levels of bard, (level 6 for 10 dodge, 10 spellcraft and 10 UMD, level 21 for 25 dodge, spellcraft and UMD, and level 40 for 43 dodge, 43 spellcraft and 40 UMD)along with barbarian (yah..barbarian) levels will make the loss of the monk AC bonus meaningless.<br><br>And a full 40 UMD means you can use ALL scrolls with zero failure and 99% of items out there including class and race restricted items.<br><br>Give it a shot and post back what you think of those alternatives..your build has some good potential whether you go 38 total dex or 40.<br><br>As to the piercing resistance issue..heh dont forget all the arrow types out there, not to mention the bows with extra damage of non-piercing types...and never forget that unlimited arcane scroll use means access to spell breaches, spell mantles, globes, and stat reducing effects, PLUS a full selection of divine scrolls once you hit 40 UMD.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Elanthil Seldavius on 05/12/05 12:22</span></i></p>
