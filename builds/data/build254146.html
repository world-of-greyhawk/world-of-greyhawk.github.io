Let it be known that I don't attempt iconic builds, but rather, <i>iconoclasstic</i> ones.  I've done a bit of research on this, and I think I am safe in saying that this is the strongest Halfling in the world. It's a timeless classic Dragon Disciple template that doesn't break any new ground, other than an exploration that a Bard/Ftr/Rdd is a potent combination no matter what race.  This is the strongest Halfling possible, who 2-hands a Bastard sword, and who can lay down some serious damage while still being balanced in AC, saves, skills, and abilities.  Technically, he is not the "strongest" since it is possible to get a "41" strength, but the end result is the same.  <br><br>The name "Bullroarer" was a nickname given to old Bandobras Took, a Hobbit who had defeated a goblin/worg invasion in Tolkien mythology, and who had, in one stroke, knocked the head clean off the Goblin chieftain (to which it is further reported that this inspired the invention of Golf). Legend states that he was the only Hobbit tall enough to ride a horse.

I'd probably use a Scimitar with this guy, since that's the only two-handed weapon with 18-20 crit range (and is not a two-handed weapon for most PCs, obviously). Halflings and gnome get a little treat with Scimitar.<br><br>Interesting build, sir dwarf <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a>

Another Halfling of Doom! Yey!<br><br>Well done GD, show 'em there are good reasons to show some respect to the small folks. They ain't all furry and sweet. Nay.<br><br>My only suggestion, after doing some math, is to go with Scimitar. You always (against all ACs) get a higher damage output (apart crit immunes of course) especially with a keen weapon. More importantly, it would free up one feat slot for Lingering Song.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!

my thoughts echo highlander's.  a halfling with a 40 strength is something i nevered considered.  it would be rather frightening to be tied into a pretzel by a halfling.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Bull-roarer indeed, Griz.

Hm. I made build somewhat similar. It was Bard/Rogue/RDD though, with slightly higher DEX and rapier for weapon. And light armour. It worked very well, except a few minor troubles in around lvls 10-15. So I cannot see why this contradiction of reality should not work well. And I agree to the Bastard sword.

(Though I suppose you only get the full +2 50% of the time from Cat's Grace)  Are 40 extra HP not worth the -1 to saves?

Grizzled, thanks for the help with my newbie soloing career <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  I'm trying out two of the builds you suggested and seeing how that goes. However I keep coming back to this build. Could you post how you would turn this into a Strongest Halfling in the World with Dev. Crit?<br><br>I can't shake the idea that a 40 strength Halfling, with dev. crit and 2-handing a Scimitar, would be silly fun to play. I keep picturing him wading through a throng of orcs and lopping of their heads one swing at a time <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>           --- Chumgeyser ---

It's actually a pretty simple conversion from what I can see, though I am certain someone would correct me if I am wrong.<br><br>Toss out Exotic Weapon Prof for Power Attack, Toughness for Cleave, and Extend Spell or Still (probably Extend, as Bard Buffs are fairly long lasting with 16 levels and the ones that aren't wouldn't even last an extra combat with Extend) for Great Cleave.   Shuffle the feats a bit so WF comes earlier.<br><br>Next, at level 24 takes Overwealming Cirt, at 25th take Devastating Crit, then take Epic WF at level 27.  If you really really want 40 STR, you can trade Epic Prowess + Armor Skin for these two, though it's not recommended.<br><br>Frankly, this guy doesn't even need Dev Crit, though, it should carve though enemies snickerty snap.

Excellent! Thanks Ariel. You're probably right that this guy doesn't need dev. crit. but it seems like a good build to have dev. crit. what with the lopping off of orcs heads and all.<br><br>Hmm I think Peter Jackson should make a movie about Bullroarer. Knowing Jackson he would want to stay pretty true to the story so Bullroarer would most likely be knocking orcs heads off with a big hammer <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">
