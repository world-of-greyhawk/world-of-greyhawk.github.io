Well, there is no such thing as enough AB and AC, but I am trying to decide on a pure bard build to apply for the Pure Class Builds. The one pure bard there is made to be a caster mostly, and I am definetly going for more of a Skald, ST-based. The one I am toying with at the moment has 38 AB with his Bastard Sword. I will add more info on him later on, to be discussed, but for starters, is that a decent AB in your opinion?<br><br>Thanks in advance.

THe pure builds, called ICONIC builds were a group of builds designed to BEST show how a class would be, in other words the iconic bard.  <br><br>A level 40 bard is, well, alittle different.  THe thing that would be iconic about a lv 40 bard isnt the AB, it would be the SINGING, after all, that is what bards do.  To really make use of a lv 40 bard, you would need a perform of 120!  I dont know about you, but 120 is in the realm of impossible to achieve, without some serious hacking!  IOW, the iconic bard really isnt a pure bard.  It would be a bard/fighter thing..  maybe bard/rdd/ftr.  In my very humble opinion, 24 bard is really the highest you need to go in order to get a "pure"ness to the character. <br><br>Also, a bastard sword, which isnt part of the bard weapons, wouldnt fit in this category either.  <br><br>To answer the question, 38 is low AB.  iT IS STANDARD 3/4 progression.  IF you want to add more ab, take some fighter type class.<br><br>In closing, unless there is a very good reason to take 40 bard levels (and i cannot think of one other than purely RP) bard works best mixed up with other classes.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Yep, I should listen to Avado =)<br><br>And the idea is just that, to make a pure lvl 40 fighting Bard. He has all the feats possible to increase his natural Perform, but no, he is nowhere close to 100 or 120. I think the Bard's weapon proficiencies aren't anything to write home about either, and since I was going to spend a feat on weapon proficiencies anyway, the Bastard came along with good dmg, possibility to use a shield, he can GMW/Keen it and a hint of uniqueness, which I thought fit the bard. <br><br>His naked Perform score is 62 so far. Same for Discipline. Listen at 52, 45 Spellcraft, and 57 in Taunt. After Song, Perform goes up to 73, enough for a lvl 24 Curse Song without items, and enough for lvl 25 Curse with a casting of Eagle's (effectively raising to-hit to 44). <br><br>I will work on posting the whole build here for appreciation and tweaks first. And I will concede the point on Iconic Bards... Maybe then I will work on an Iconic Skald (to justify the hunt for a balance among casting, Songs and fighting abilities)!!!<br><br>Thanks again Avado.

38 AB is ok for a Bard with its buffing/debuffing capabilities. You also get Taunt as an indirect AB booster. All together, you'll be hitting at a pretty sweet effective AB.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die
