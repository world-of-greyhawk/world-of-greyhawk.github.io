So I decided to try and create one.<br><br>This is the result – Getting all the pre requisites for epic dodge with shadow dancer meant I pretty much had to go and get it, this did mean I couldn’t get the wisdom needed for dragon shape – so no stealth dragons.<br><br>I only went for enough dex to get epic dodge as in every shape I tried dex was over ridden to a lower or equal level, wisdom was left at an odd number because it was the most I could get without losing any shapes – and I wanted as many shapes as possible<br><br>The biggest weaknesses are a truly awful AB for what will be a character that relies on melee – the shapes will mitigate this somewhat but its still very low, also you don’t get many of the best shapes until very late on in the build.<br><br>the only other alternative was to swap the shifter and shadowdancer levels to be shifter heavy at the start and then go shadow dancer, this means getting epic dodge very late in the build instead, and would need a rejig of great wisdoms for great dexteritys, might work I haven’t tried.<br><br>So any ways to improve this whilst keeping the general theme?<br><br>I will say that I haven’t played this build at all – I built the idea in the novice to epic character creator. So don’t know how it will cope in either pvm or pvp, id say the AB means no pvp, pvm may work but could be tough in places.<br><br>However a stealthy epic dodging iron golem is kinda funny……

I shuffled the epic levelling a bit to get Undead Shape at lvl 24. You also get your Epic Wildshapes and Humanouid Shapes at shifterlevel 11, 15 and 17 a little earlier. <br>You get Epic Dodge at lvl 27. <br>I haven't tested it IG, but I think it should work:<br><br><br>21	Shifter 9 – Great Wisdom I<br>22	SD 8 <br>23 	Shifter 10<br>24 	Shifter <b>11</b> – <i>Undead Shape</i>, +1 Dex<br>25 	Shifter 12  <br>26 	SD 9<br>27 	SD 10 – <i>Epic Dodge</i><br>28 	Shifter 13 - Great Wisdom II, +1 Wis<br>29 	Shifter 14 – <br>30 	Shifter <b>15</b> – Great Wisdom III<br>31	Shifter 16 - Great Wisdom IV <br>32 	Shifter <b>17</b> <br>33 	SD 11 - +1 Wis, Great Wisdom V<br>34 	SD 12<br>35	Shifter 18<br>36 	Shifter 19 – Great Wisdom VI, Great Wisdom VII, +1 Wis<br>37 	SD 13 – Epic Reflexes<br>38 	Shifter 20<br>39 	Shifter 21 – Outsider Shape<br>40	Shifter 22 – Construct Shape, +1 Wis<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 06/20/06 08:19</span></i></p>

Might I suggest dropping WP Martial and the Heavy Armor feat .<br><br>Unless you have a set of Heavy Armor in mind that has sweet magic on it.<br><br>Take Improved Critical Unarmed and Blind Fighting instead.
