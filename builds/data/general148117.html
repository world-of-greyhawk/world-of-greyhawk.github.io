You won't be a "mega" caster with 2 classes.  Low dc due to splitting wis/chr/int, low spell penetration, no epic spells, no epic bonus feats etc etc.  And the best casters are without a doubt arcane, each with it's own advantages/disadvantages.

If you are going for spell quantity, you will want either cleric/sorcerer or cleric/wizard. If you are looking for spell power, then what evo already stated applies.

I wouldnt want to melee a fast buffed Dragon with IKD. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   Plus Zen Archery (maybe use sling)?  Not a great meleer, but not bad.<br><br>1/21/18 Monk/Cleric/Druid or some such variant would not have IKD, but should be similar in many repects, and get Epic Spells.  But I dont think the epic spells available for Clerics and Druids are worth it in general, IMO.<br>_________________<br>Normal kids play rock-paper-scissors.<br>Shifter kids play IronGolem-RustMonster-MindFlayer. . .

i have been playing a cleric/druid/rogue for about a month on the PW i normally play on.  it takes a LONG time to lvl once you are past 20 lol.  but anywah.  yeah it is pretty nice.  thought about the monk, with teh wis bonus to ac, but i decided that full plate and shiled with magic vestment gave just as much ac.  also, on this server large shields often give bonus to wis, (mostly a cleric sheild) so that is what i am sticking with.<br>for sheer number of spells, well...more bang for your buck here.  however, this is not a melee chara, at the lower lvls it can melee, but not as good as a pure tank, but you can heal.  the higher you get, the more you shift into a caster. <br>also, the server i play on is focused around team play, there is simply no soloing past lvl 7-8, so with all the buffs and heals this one gets, comes in quite handy.  and it is a decent nuker, nothin like a wiz or sorc, but can pack a punch.<br>once you are up there and mostly casting, you can get access to dragon form so if you need to tank a little, you have a dragon with a ton of clerical/druid buffs. <br><br>i can post the build if anyone is interrested, its pretty simple.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By timfred on 08/16/04 15:26</span></i></p>
