Hey all, right now this post is riddled with stuff about the legendary Puff, so I hope someone will have the time to actually SEE this (no offense to cdaulepp, it's an awesome build). More specifically I hope TORIAS sees this, because I based this build off of his Divine Warrior build. Help is wanted folks, especially you Torias  .<br><br>Anyways, if you want to see the Divine Warrior build, it's on the main Bioware site with the rest of the super powerful characters, and also on the second page of Excellent Character Builds v 1.0 (so long ago).<br><br>Without further ado then, I present:<br><br>Devotee of Torm<br>Race: Human<br><br>Stats:<br>STR - 14<br>DEX - 10<br>CON - 12<br>INT - 10<br>WIS - 14<br>CHA - 16<br>Bump WIS and CHA in even intervals until Wis is at maximum level you desire for spellcasting level (level four I think is a minimum-but this can go up to 19). After that, CHA all the way.<br><br>Skills:<br>Discipline, Persuade, Spellcraft maxed<br><br>Levels:<br>Divine Warrior build has it fighter 8/paladin 6/CoT 26. For this build, keep the paladin at 6, replace fighter with cleric, and take away from CoT levels as much as you want to add to cleric levels. The one I'm currently considering is cleric 16/paladin 6/CoT 18. With this, I'd still get significant CoT bonuses, but also have access to level 8 spells (specifically Aura vs. Alignment, Mass Heal, or Sunbeam). Another idea is to take the CoT levels down to 12, thus adding ninth level spells and one epic spell to the Devotee's repertoire. However, I believe that would really cut down on the melee capabilities of this character, so I'll likely go for the first one.<br><br>Feats:<br>Basically the same as the Divine Warrior ones, substituting the Weapon Specialization and a few other feats (including a few Great Charismas if needed) for solid clerical feats, such as extend/empower spell, planar turning (because with such a high charisma and cleric/paladin level you will turn well), spell penetration, and combat casting(s).<br>As for cleric domains, I'd suggest Good, Air, Healing, and War. Healing would become fairly useless after getting mass heal (if that's a goal of yours), war is useful for melee capability, air would allow you elemental turning and some damage spells, and good would eliminate the need for planar turning (a valuable feat slot) while also giving helpful spells. It's your pick.<br><br>Overall this character takes away a bit of melee capability for lots and lots of buffs and a few good damage dealing spells.<br><br>As I said, comments are extremely welcome, and I hope you like this character.<br>_________________<br>CoolRMM<br>"You can do anything you set your mind to when you have vision, determination, and an endless supply of expendable labor."<br><br>Edited By CoolRMM on 03/26/04 20:50:14<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By billb0 on 04/11/04 15:21</span></i></p>

OK, so is this a separate build that needs a levelling progression or a variant of the Divine Warrior - meaning I should just attach it to that topic?

Commentary by CoolRMM and Torias:  <br><br>  Quote: Posted 03/27/04 20:38:37 (GMT) by CoolRMM<br><br>    @ Torias: I'm still working on the Devotee of Torm and I noticed in my post on the main forum section that you suggested Cleric 17/Paladin 1/CoT 18. Because I based it off of your build, I'm wondering why you took the extra 7 paladin levels in the first place, and what bonuses they offer you (I noticed that only one of those paladin levels was epic). Wouldn't it have been better to make them all fighter for more feats? Anyways, any enlightenment you could give me would help. Thanks.<br><br><br>those paladin levels were to qualify and take Divine Might, Extra Turning and Divine Shield.<br><br>you can do that with cleric levels as well, since clerics can also turn undead.<br><br>in that case, you only really need the one paladin level for Divine Grace<br><br>my suggestion would be to go Cleric 16 / Paladin 1 / Champion of Torm 3 to start with, then take 1 level of cleric for the level 9 spells, and 19 levels of champion of Torm.<br><br>Champion of Torm actually provides Great Wisdom on it's bonus epic feat list... so perhaps you could use that to increase your wisdom to be able to cast spells...

Hey all. I finally finished tweaking my Devotee of Torm build, the one based off of Torias' Divine Warrior character. I also saw Herbie Shimmer's Disciple of Torm and it is very similar to this. Anyway, I would really like comments/corrections obviously to make this as good as it can be.<br><br>Devotee of Torm:<br>Race - Human<br><br>Stats:<br>STR - 14<br>DEX - 10<br>CON - 12<br>WIS - 14<br>INT - 10<br>CHA - 16<br>Bump WIS at 4, 12, 24, 32, 40<br>Bump CHA at 8, 16, 20, 28, 36<br><br>Skills:<br>Concentration - 43<br>Persuade - 43<br>Discipline - 42<br>Your Choice - 1<br><br>Levels - Champion of Torm 22/Cleric 17/Paladin 1<br><br>Level Progression:<br>1 - Paladin<br>8 - Cleric<br>5 - Champion of Torm<br>1 - Cleric<br>2 - Champion of Torm<br>1 - Cleric<br>3 - Champion of Torm<br>3 - Cleric<br>6 - Champion of Torm<br>2 - Cleric<br>2 - Champion of Torm<br>1 - Cleric<br>4 - Champion of Torm<br>1 - Cleric<br><br>Feat Progression:<br>1 - Luck of Heroes, Toughness<br>3 - Combat Casting<br>6 - Weapon Focus<br>9 - Extra Turning<br>11 - Power Attack<br>12 - Extra Smiting<br>13 - Cleave<br>15 - Divine Might<br>16 - Extend Spell OR Improved Critical OR Spell Penetration<br>18 - Divine Shield<br>19 - Great Cleave<br>21 - Epic Weapon Focus, Great Charisma I,<br>24 - Great Charisma II<br>27 - Great Charisma III<br>28 - Improved Combat Casting OR Armor Skin OR Epic Prowess OR Epic Spell Penetration (if you picked Spell Penetration at level 16) OR Great Charisma IV<br>30 - Great Charisma IV (V if you picked IV at level 28)<br>33 - Great Smite I<br>34 - Great Smite II<br>36 - Great Smite III<br>39 - Great Charisma V (VI if you picked V at level 30), Great Smite IV<br><br>As I previously mentioned, this character is a variant of the Divine Warrior. As such, it has very good offensive and defensive qualities. Defensively, it's saving throws are excellent, and combined with Divine Shield's bonuses to AC, make for a difficult-to-hit character. Offensively, it can combine Divine Might with Divine Wrath and Smite Evil to really bring down the house on any evil baddies around.<br><br>However, in addition to all this, it gets the ability to cast cleric spells, from level one to level nine. This adds tons of offensive and defensive power to the character, as he can cast loads and loads of buffs, summon powerful creatures, or bring down some fiery divine wrath upon the heads of evil. Or he can do all three. I really think the cleric spells really help this build to shine, and take care of the fact that the Champion of Torm special abilities will not be as powerful due to less charisma and feat investment.<br><br>This character is also customizable in that one can specialize in fighting ability, defensive spells, or offensive spells. At certain key levels, separate feats may be chosen to suit the player's preference.<br><br>All in all this character is a very effective fighting force, and from a roleplaying aspect, has run the gamut of available classes that can dedicate themselves from Torm. The Devotee would also have a motivation in any crusade or campaign against the forces of evil.<br><br>Again, I'd love to hear what you all have to say about my finished build (especially Torias, as you expressed interest in it), and I hope you like what you see.<br>_________________<br>CoolRMM<br>"You can do anything you set your mind to when you have vision, determination, and an endless supply of expendable labor."

Yes, I realized how relatively worthless Luck of Heroes is in comparison to Extend/Empower Spell. I agree with your recommendation heartily but the problem I'm having is this. At the pre-epic level that I gave feat options (16 I believe), I think that, in light of the fact that this character is not using criticals to do his significant damage, Improved Critical is the most useless of the options. If I take extend spell at level three, should I take empower spell or spell penetration at level 16? I know if I take penetration I might as well take epic penetration but I'm wondering if skipping Imp. Combat Casting is worth it. I also know that many of the advanced HotU monsters (the campaign I'm gonna play this on) have high SR. Any thoughts?<br>_________________<br>CoolRMM<br>"You can do anything you set your mind to when you have vision, determination, and an endless supply of expendable labor."
