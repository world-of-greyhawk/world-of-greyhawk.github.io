Nah, doesn't matter. Not many people would respond to the announcments anyway. Nor even respond in some threads.... many people, but almost all of them are lacking in being involved with the guild.<br><br>Such as for the servers, so far, no one has spoken up and said that they would host it. ~Sigh~<br><br>I might as well go ahead and discuss to one of those people from Conferation of some sort Server. I have several ideas that they could use and I wanted to ask them if it would be possible to have epic character server connected to theirs so we can have tournaments every month to see whoever is the best of all. Or something like that.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.
