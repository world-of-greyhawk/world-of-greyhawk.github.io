She did 56 to 73 per hit on Cot/Paladin types. Made all her saves, including one against devastating critical. She lasted a LONG TIME due to damage reduction before she went down. And like many of my other build, she has access to spot and listen, allow her to see many of the invisible mages and stealth types. She only had trouble against concealed types.<br>_________________<br>Which Stick are you?<br><a href="http://www.ihateyour.com/cgi-bin/bbs/YaBB.cgi?action=games;game=Stuntexperience" target="_blank">Click Here</a>
