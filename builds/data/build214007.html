Pity I couldn't squeeze in epic dodge, I'll try something on these lines using less rogue and dropping fighter levels in favour of shadow dancer in a future post. The build is DEX based of course, so it will have problems in damage output against crit immune creatures, but UMD allows alternative damage dealing solutions while DR 15 and SCV keep you alive.<br><br>Advantages<br>1) Decent AB (43), and good critical range (15-20) which can be improved by a keen rapier<br><br>2) Decent naked AC (31)<br><br>3) Good amount of HP <br><br>4) UMD, stealth and rogue skills as you see fit<br><br>5) DR 15 and Sc V: you get hit only half the times and when you do you take SOME edge off the damage<br><br>6) Defensive Stance 11/day: +2 STR, *4 CON, *2 saves, *4 dodge AC. The concealed wall can keep his ground<br><br>7) 8d6 sneak attack, to be delivered via stealth and/or IKD<br><br> 8)      Improved evasion coupled with a good ref save against spells<br><br>Disadvantages<br><br>1) Moderate to low saves (will) but with a decent bonus against spells (thanks to dwarven heritage and spellcraft ranks)<br><br>2) No crippling strike, slippery mind or other rogue bonus feats (only improved evasion)<br><br>3) No epic dodge<br><br>4) Low damage output against crit immunes: needs to acquire STR boosting items<br><br>5) No WS/EWS<br><br>6) A bit feat starved, especially in epic levels<br><br><br>By dropping 3 lvls of DwD I could get blinding speed at the cost of armour skin and 3 DR (and -1/day defensive stance). What do you think, is it worth it?<br><br>Please, give some feedback on this build.

Nicely done. Indeed a pity you couldn't slip Epic Dodge into the build.

if you want to see what the dwarflord has to say about builds like this check out my build, the Melee Void, a 22 DD and 18 Rogue.  he recommends a slightly different leveling (from mine and yours, but closer to yours) than yours here, but you should be able to get epic dodge, sc iv and still have 12 DR.  just an idea.<br><br>i also recommend searching with pulse caps search engine.  it can help you develop a character more easily and give great advice without having to wait for further posting.<br><br>enjoy!<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>Do not meddle in the affairs of Dragons, for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.

Thanks Cinnabar for pointing out the missing feat, I forgot to type in Armor Skin at lvl 40. It's already calculated in the naked AC though, just forgot to type it in the leveling schedule.<br><br>Steve, yeah, you're right. I didn't go for epic dodge cause it means SC3. I could probably drop 3 lvls of DwD and go SC4 and ED (loosing armor skin). It's the same number of feats but you need a rogue bonus feat for defensive roll.<br>I guess it's a matter of personal preferences, so go for it if you feel<br><br>I'll check out your build chris, thanks

Epic Dodge will make your SC5 a minimum of 2 times more effective against your last attacker or current target. <br><br>Even if he can hit you on a 2 with his first attack and has 4 attacks per round. <br><br>With SC5 you get hit, on average, 23 times in 20 rounds<br>With ED/SC5 you will get hit,on average, 9 times in 20 rounds<br><br>ED is made that much more effective when combined with SC due to the way in which they stack.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

Plus, this build doesn't have access to Improved Invis except on scrolls, which have a very limited duration.  If your build can get Improved Invis as a spell with decent duration, then it can be used as an alternative, but often the builds that tend to use SC V have the room for it...there are honestly a lack of spectacular epic feats for a dex build.  You could get more Great Dex, but again, most self concealment builds take advantage of epic bonus feats (rogue or shadowdancer bonus feats for example) in order to get to SC V, and Great Dex is rarely an option for those.  So, often it ends up being a choice of about 1 extra AC and AB and a few extra bonus feats you didn't need or want, or permanent 50% concealment.<br><br>Steve

To me it seems as if DR and ED/SC dont mix that well. I mean if you can avoid getting hit you dont need DR and if you dont get hurt when getting hit you dont need concealment. So in this case I get a feeling that 1+1 is less than 2.<br>However it is very cool to have both.

Sure they do, if you could get both ED and SC V and max DR then yes. But if you have to give up and get half of each I say max of one is better.<br>So what I meant is 1/2 + 1/2 in this case is less than 1.

Thanks for the enlightnenig comments guys!<br>Chris, Syrath I agree with you that SC4/ED/DR12 gets the best of both worlds and in fact I'm thinking of modifying the build by going DwD 19/Rg 19 to get defensive roll with the additional rogue bonus feat slot.<br>There's still the possibility of going DwD 14/Rg 24 to get SC5/ED/DR 9. In this case I would also move at least one of the fighter levels in epic so as to compensate for the lost DwD bonus feats. This costs 1AB, but moving only 1 fighter lvl to epic actually improves your will saves by 1 (moving 2 lvls means an additional +1 ref but -2 fort).<br><br>Syrath, for the maths I meant that I'd like to see what's the difference between SC5 and SC4/ED in the number of attacks that connect. It's then easy to calculate the maximun damage absorbed (attacks that land times DR). The difference betwen DR 15 and DR 12 is then (3 damage points) times (connecting attacks) in the amount of maximun damage absorbed. So, for example, if with ED/SC5 you get hit on average 9 times in 20 rounds, that totals to 27 damage points difference in 20 rounds.<br><br>My concern about reducing too much DR is that blind fight makes SC less effective, so I don't want to rely too much on SC alone...sure ED takes care of the first connecting attack each round but having some good DR is not gonna hurt, IMHO.<br><br>Anyhow, it seems like I've now got 3 variants of this build, thanks to your feedback <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>1) Rg 16/DwD 22/Fg 2 with SC5/DR 15<br>2) Rg 19/DwD 19/Fg 2 with SC4/ED/DR 12<br>3) Rg 24/DwD 14/Fg 2 with SC5/ED/DR 9<br><br>As for me I'm kinda unsure between 2) and 3), considering also the loss in HP by reducing considerably the DwD lvls.

Im also going to assume an average 30 dmg per hit.<br><br>Initially with your SC5/DR 15/- only your attacker will roll to hit in 20 rounds the following<br>1st attacks 10 hits, 5 will miss due to concealment<br>2nd attacks 5 hits, 2.5 will miss due to concealment<br>3rd attack 1 hit, 0.5 will miss due to concealment<br>4th attack 1 hit, 0.5 will miss due to concealment<br><br>So total hits, on average will be 8.5 hits average over a 20 round period, each doing 15 dmg.

This is in a one on one situation only. <br><br>Example 2 - Now imagine you have 3 of the exact same attackers attacking you. <br><br>You will get 27% more dmg(17% from the difference in concealment and 10% from the extra 3 dmg per hit) from 3 attackers and 80 percent less dmg from one. So even against multiple foes ED/SC4/DR12 still stacks up well. <br><br>Now example 3. 10 bowmen(not melee since you cant have that many around you) hitting you, you will get an extra 27% more dmg from the other 9(total 243%) and 80 % less dmg from one. Clearly in this situation SC5/DR 15 wins out.<br><br><i>EDIT where I talk of percent more dmg this is percentage more dmg based on 20 rounds of hits. So in the above example if you get 243% more dmg from 9 bowmen and 80% less dmg from one you get 163% more dmg overall 163%*127.5=208 dmg more. Given that in this example the total damage done by the bowmen is around 1275 on the SC5 build I think you will find that even against 10 bowmen the SC5 build is only taking 17% less dmg than the SC4/ED build. </i><br><br>So anything up to 3 attackers SC4/ED/DR 12 is a match for SC5/DR 15 WHERE the first attack lands on a 10 for all attackers and they do an average of 30 dmg each. <br><br>Beyond 3 attackers SC5/DR 15 is the better choice, however not considerably and certainly not by the margin of the difference of one attacker.<br><br>Blind Fight doesnt really change the results of this since it affects the SC5 build more than the ED/SC4 build. <br><br>The number of attacks per round from the attackers does change this also. The lesser the attacks the better ED does, the more attacks the performance of ED goes down. Especially if those attacks are at higher AB however this also holds true for the SC5 build. <br><br>The higher the damage per attack makes things better for the epic dodge build since he gets to avoid more dmg. <br><br>It really comes down to cicrumstances. Someone with DR 15/- getting hit for 15 dmg each time has no need for SC5 or ED since he takes no dmg at all from any hit.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By syrath1001 on 09/27/05 12:59</span></i></p>

To make things clearer I did a quick spreadsheat(since some of the above figures are a little bit estimated for multiple attackers). First number is the number of attackers the 2nd is the dmg done on SC5/DR 15. 3rd is the dmg done on ED/SC4/DR 12. The 3rd number is the percent dmg difference. <br><br>1	128	25	19.53<br>2	255	209	81.96<br>3	383	392	102.35<br>4	510	576	112.94<br>5	638	760	119.12<br>6	765	943	123.27<br>7	893	1126	126.09<br>8	1020	1310	128.43<br>9	1148	1494	130.14<br>10	1275	1678	131.61<br><br>Against 1 attacker there is no contest. Against 2 the ED build takes 20 percent less dmg. However note that even in the extreme of 10 attackers the difference is still only 31 percent.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

Thanks Syrath, your analysis is awesome! The pros and cons of SC5 vs SC4/ED build are quite clear.<br><br>I'm just left with the doubt now whether getting SC5/ED by reducing DD lvls (going Rg24/DD14/Fg2) thus reducig DR, DS uses per day and HP is worthwhile or not.

Nice build.  You've already received lots of great advice regarding ED/SC/DR, so I won't belabour that point anymore.<br><br>My one suggestion is to give you more sneak damage output by taking Ambi/ITWF.  You would need to drop Iron Will, Improved Crit and perhaps Blindfighting, and take a focus in a light weapon.  Not sure if that's worth it or not, though it could be easily attainable by adding 4 more levels of fighter.  You give up some 3DR, but you give yourself 2 more attacks.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

You give up some 3DR, but you give yourself 2 more attacks.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Hail to the Dwarflord!<br>Thanks for the advice I did try something and got this:<br>Rogue 20/Fg 6/DwD 14<br>1     Rogue	1	TWF		<br>2     Rogue	2			<br>3     Rogue	3	Weapon Finesse		<br>4     Fighter	1	Ambidexterity, Dex<br>5     Fighter	2	WF (short sword)	<br>6     Fighter	3	Dodge		<br>7     Fighter	4	WS	<br>8     Rogue	4	Dex<br>9     Rogue	5	Toughness		<br>10    DD	1			<br>11    DD	2			<br>12    DD	3	KD, Dex<br>13    DD	4			<br>14    DD	5			<br>15    DD	6	ITWF		<br>16    DD	7	Dex<br>17    Rogue     6			<br>18    DD	8	IKD		<br>19    DD	9			<br>20    DD	10	Dex<br>21    Rogue	7	Great Dex		<br>22    Rogue	8			<br>23    Rogue	9			<br>24    Rogue	10	Great Dex, Improved Evasion, Dex<br>25    DD	11			<br>26    DD	12			<br>27    DD	13	Great Dex		<br>28    DD	14	EWF, Dex<br>29    Rogue	11			<br>30    Rogue	12	Great Dex		<br>31    Fighter	5			<br>32    Rogue	13	Defensive Roll, Dex<br>33    Rogue	14	Epic Dodge		<br>34    Rogue	15			<br>35    Rogue	16	SCI	<br>36    Rogue	17	SCII, Dex<br>37    Rogue	18			<br>38    Rogue	19	SCIII	<br>39    Fighter	6	SCIV, EWS		<br>40    Rogue	20       Dex<br><br><br>IC had to go, together with blind fighting and iron will.

Pre-epic, go rogue(10)/DwD(10), putting all boosts in DEX (DEX is now 23), and taking Improved Evasion at rogue 10.

Thanks Steve, I completely forgot that HS taken in epic lvls grants  Great Dex as a bonus feat. <br>Well, so now I know it's possible to get everything... I'm not sure it's really worthwhile though
