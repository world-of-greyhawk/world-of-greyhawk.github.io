He was a prototype, and the first of his kind in the Guild.  But rather than drag up the old thread, it seemed appropriate to give this revision new life.   As for this new Negotiator, he is nothing more than a Fighter/Thief that showcases the value of the Harper Prestige Class.  A Fighter/Rogue has the easiest time meeting the requirements for Harper because, <i>A)</i> all the skills are relevant to the two classes involved, <i>B)</i> Iron Will needs to be taken anyway, and <i>C)</i> the Halfling's Listen Bonus stacks quite nicely with the Alertness Feat.  <br><br>But what holds the allure for me in such a build is the placement of Epic Dodge and Self-Concealment.  Epic Dodge at Lvl 21 is as good as it gets.   SC I at Lvl 27 with SC III by Level 30 is as good as it gets.  This is what makes Harper's rock.  If you are in a slow to moderate levelling environment, getting 3 of the 5 SC feats by Level 30 makes the pre-epic investment well worth it.  This tremendously increases the playability and utitilty of an SC V build, where one typically waits till Lvl 32+ to take the first SC feat.  Further, the two extra Great Dex's also raise AB, AC, Reflex and Stealth skill all by one, which makes for nice icing on the cake.<br><br>The Harper's Toolbox is complete by Level 26.  A 42 dualwielding AB with 13d6sneak, Called Shot, EWS and a 36 Dexterity provide a dangerous offensive punch.   All of this is then supplemented with the Rogue skill set-- UMD, Set Traps, Hide and Move Silently-- and the Harper Negotiator can deal with any situation.<br><br>One important note: KD/IKD were dropped from the build intentionally.  I enjoyed success without it, though for any IKDaholics, there is room pre-epic if you drop Called Shot and Blindfighting, though I find the latter to be of more utility.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/14/07 13:40</span></i></p>

A very nice build, impressive results regarding how soon you get ED/SC feats. Really nice AB dual wielding too.<br><br>I would probably start with 10 STR, CON 12 for extra HP, since they are really low. As a dexer you won't be carrying around much equipment and +1 DMG is no big deal to lose.<br>No spellcraft ranks? I would expect at least some, given the poor saves. You'll probably have an AC substantially higher than your discipline ranks, is it really worthwhile to spend all those points in discipline? I mean, if they manage to hit you you are going to fail your discipline check most of the times if not all (AC=64 with +5 gear, discipline 43). Also, choosing not to be able to set deadly gas traps could give you +10 skill points, could be worth it. I think some points for spellcraft can be found here and there.<br><br>If you've got easy access to darkness/ultravision KD/IKD is much less necessary. Calle dshot and blind fight though are difficult to substitute, so I am with you on that one.<br><br>An excellent build, giving the HS some prestige. Kudos to the Dwarflord! <br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

His AB and size doesn't make KD's to important anyway. Discipline can be a nice skill while leveling, but perhaps less important when you reach late epics. Anyhow, with a +discipline item it will protect against autohit on "20" at least, or give you the opportunity to carry discipline enhancing items for when the need arises. <br><br>I to strive to get epic dodge, and cinn has obviously taught you about the use of HS. This is better than the original, methinks. Well planned and well optimized for early access to powerful feats.<br><br>You show all who doubt the value of HS. All in all a good build, with the possibilty of using shield for a better AB against Hard-to-hit opponents and hard-hitting opponents. Good, Grizz.
