OK, I was asked to post this so here it goes.  I thought of this character while trying to imagine a ninja type character.  I have designed him to carry kukris instead of a katana though.  Basically, I wanted to play with a stealthy, come out of nowhere, quickly strike, then melt into shadows character.  I know there are better "kukri master" type characters out there, and I know I could get more attacks a round (not to mention save a feat) if I went kamas, but I just like the look of kukris.  I have tested this character on the Novice to Epic Character Builder, and have to admit, I can't wait to get him in one of my favorite PW's.  I decided to go fighter to raise my pre-20 bab (it gets me to +16 for 4 attacks per round), and for access to the weapon specialization feats (so I can actually do a little bit of damage with a dexer).  Please let me know if you see any way in which I can improve this character.<br><br>Level up in this way:<br>8 Monk<br>5 Fighter<br>7 Shadow Dancer<br>1 Fighter<br>18 Shadow Dancer<br>1 Monk<br><br>Beggining Stats:<br>Str-10<br>Dex-20-&gt;32 (10 on levels + 2 with Feats)<br>Con-10<br>Wis-10<br>Int-14<br>Cha-8<br>*I went 14 Int instead of adding to Wis for extra skill points <br><br>On Monk levels- up Discipline, Hide, Move Silently, Tumble<br>On Fighter levels- up Discipline<br>On Shadow Dancer levels- up Hide, Move Silently, Tumble, Lore, and Pick Pocket (what's the use of having a halfling shadow dancer if you aren't able to "find" things every once and awhile? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">  )<br>*on the last Monk level you can do 1 of 2 things, depending on how you would like to play.

Parry will never be fixed. You can see this intention by looking at how many  prestige classes were given the skill as a class skill. ie none of them. Even COT doesnt get parry as a class skill. <br><br>The reason, if it worked as intended in the book it would be too powerful. Being able to pretty much make yourself impossible to hit for the first 3 hits in one on one combat is a little powerful. Especially if you also have epic dodge, and SC5. You can get your parry skill well into the 80s meaning that no melee AB is going to be able to touch you. <br><br>ATM you are limited to 3 counter attacks so dual wielding is pretty useless. If your AC is high enough to force a 20 to hit situation parry is useless anyway, since a natural 20 is still a hit regardless of parry. So all it does in that situation is prevent you from attacking. <br><br>Syrath

Thanks for explaining that Syrath.  Then I heartily recommend going the 20 points into Spellcraft route for the help on saves.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.
