Isn't the Divine Wrath bonus factored into the +20 max to AB bonuses?<br><br>Off to test, be back shortly.

Divine Wrath is feat based and so does not count towards the Magical cap...however for some strange reason it does not stack with the Cleric's war domain...though the character sheet may tell us otherwise!

Having just checked in Novice to Epic Character Maker with a CoT build, you are incorrect.  The character sheet does not register the +20 maximum, which means, with a +13 Divine Wrath and a +20 weapon (or a True Strike scroll, which is the same thing for these purposes), it will register a +33 bonus to your AB.<br><br>However, if you will watch your attack rolls in the dialogue window, you will notice that the number being added to your rolls is actually 13 less than the attack bonus recorded on your character sheet.  This is because the game engine, unlike the documentation, does take the +20 limit into account when calculating attack bonus.<br><br>This is the same reason that, if you hold a +20 weapon and cast True Strike, your character sheet will register a +40 bonus, even though you don't actually gain anything.<br><br>Sorry <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  .

hmm...as I'm at work at the moment I'm not really in a position to test this, however I haven't had any problems with Divine Wrath stacking in the past <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_mad.gif"> <br>Oh well, c'est la vie!
