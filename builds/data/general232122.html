I will admit that I am lazy on this one and did not want to check all the topics to see if this has been debated in the past.<br><br>My question (Being mainly a meleer in the past) - Which is better Wizard or Sorc?  Or for that matter maybe Bard?<br><br>I am seeking to play a spell thrower.  Something that devistates the mobs and bosses alike.  I have of course played with mages in the past but I dont know the difference between them and am interested in learning the spells that they get.<br><br>Thanks in advance for all your advise!

Advantages of Wizards over Sorcs:<br><br>versatility - they are not restricted by whatever spells they have learnt over the course of their levelling...if they need a particular spell and do not have it, they can buy the scoll and all is gravy<br><br>feats - wizards gain an extra feat every 5 levels &amp; 3 levels in the epic region, this means they get plenty of oportunity to get those nice spell related feats<br><br>skillz - as they are intelligence based they end up with phenominal numbers of skill points <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>Advantages of Sorcs over Wizards:<br><br>versatility - they do not have to memorize spells. In this fashion they can use their spells to the maximum and are not left with any spells memorized that they did not need!<br><br>spells per day - sorcerors will always have more daily spells than a wizard...even if the wizard is specialized they will have one less spell slot per day<br><br>charisma based - taking that cheesy Paladin level will give sickening saving throws with your towering Charisma<br><br>RDD - a sorceror can become a Red Dragon Disciple!<br><br>Overall wizards can be more powerful casters as they have more access to feats, however in a head to head dual, the sorceror could easily win by having more spells <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> <br><br>Bards aren't really useful as Casters, their song is maximized at lvl 30 with 100 perform...they are best used with combat classes for tumble &amp; lite-buffs<br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!
