So over the past day or so i've been working on trying to make a succesful Sneak based character. Having been dominated by a sneak rogue in the past, with what's going on in the server I play on we decided that we needed a primary sneak character, we have lots of Paladins, fighters clerics etc, but most of the time the sneak characters were evil. <br><br>So I figured the best way to make a sneaker was Fighter, SD, Rogue. With as many Rogue lvls to give the most sneaks, then with enough Fighter for Epic weapon Spec and hopefully 4 attacks a round, and SD to make backing up then goign in for anotehr sneak a lot easier. <br><br>With in mind that TS is being removed from the server except when casted, (I.e no itmes that allow one TS per day etc) The amount of True seeign with dwindle hugely. And thus the sneak character won't have to worry about being caught and slaughered in melee, becuase he'll have melee builds to back him up so he can be soley focused on Sneaks.<br><br>I tried with Kukri's and I tried with Shortbow to reasonable effect getting 26d6 sneaks, pulling in about 100+ dmg on a sneak, only there was three attacks per round and the ab was pretty weak. The build was reletively simple<br><br>Halfing for no XP penalty and 20 dex<br><br>1 rogue<br>2-3 Fighter<br>4 Rogue<br>5-6 Fighter<br>7-9 Rogue<br>10 SD<br>11-18 Rogue<br>19 Fighter<br>20 Rogue<br>21 Fighter<br>22-31 Rogue<br>32 Fighter<br>33-39 rogue<br>40 Fighter<br><br>Feats: Point Blank Shot, Weapon Focus Shortbow, Dodge, Rapid Shot, Weapon Spec Shortbow, Mobility, Blind Fight, Improved Critical Shortbow, Improved Evasion, Expertise, Defensive Roll, Improved Expertise, Epic Weapon Focus Shortbow, Epic Dodge, Improved Sneak attack I, Improved Sneak attack II, Improved Sneak attack III, Improved Sneak attack IV, Improved Sneak attack V, Improved Sneak attack VI, Improved Sneak attack VII, Improved Sneak attack VIII, Improved Sneak attack IX, Improved Sneak attack X, Epic Weapon Spec<br><br>only got 3 attacks per round, and the ab was pretty weak, not sure what else I could do to improve it though.<br>_________________<br>~I am the wisest man on earth because I know one thing, and that is I know nothing.~<br>-Cairne

If you want more attacks per round and better AB, I'd recommend following the Queen's advice on getting that 4th attack. As well, I'd go with Weapon Finesse (pretty much want daggers or kukris for a Halfling) and make sure you take the Knockdown and Improved Knockdown feats. Drop the bow feats and replace them with melee weapon feats and also pick up Ambidexterity, Two Weapon Fighting and Improved Two Weapon Fighting. That will net you 6 attacks per round (4 mainhand and 2 offhand). If you get Hasted, you'll have 7 attacks, 3 in the first flurry.<br><br>Next thing to do is max your DEX and instead of taking so many Imp Sneak feats, take GRT DEX to boost it further. You should be able to put together a character with 32 or 34 DEX (with somewhere in the vicinity of +40 unenhanced AB dual-wielding), 15d6 to 18d6 sneak attack, Epic Dodge, and maybe even be able to sneak in Epic Skill Focus:Hide and Move Silently.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
