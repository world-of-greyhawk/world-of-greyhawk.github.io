Dwarven WeaponMaster (as pure as you can get for a Prestige Class)<br><br>Main aim was to create a melee tank that had some Damage Reduction, reasonable AC (ie. using a shield!), taking the maximum levels of WM. As may be noted, Overwhelming and Devastating Critical have not been taken, these could be fitted in, but you would need to lose 3 pre-epic and 2 epic feats to accomodate, which is a little excessive. The effect would make this dependent on striking a crit on the first attack and I'm no great fan of one-trick-ponyness. <br><br>His saves are nothing special and that does bug me to be honest, but bearing in mind the aim of making as pure a WM as possible, that is what you get I'm afraid.<br><br>Dwarf (no really!)<br>Fighter 10, Weapon Master 30<br>PvM and PvP 1-40<br><br>STR: 16 (28)<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 18 (22)<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 13<br>CHA: 6<br><br>01: Fighter(1): Dodge, Mobility<br>02: Fighter(2): Weapon Focus: Warhammer<br>03: Fighter(3): Expertise<br>04: Fighter(4): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Warhammer, (STR=17)<br>05: Fighter(5)<br>06: Fighter(6): Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack<br>07: Fighter(7)<br>08: Fighter(8): STR+1, Improved Critical, (STR=18)<br>09: Fighter(9): Toughness<br>10: Fighter(10): Knockdown<br>11: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Warhammer<br>12: Weapon Master(2): CON+1, Improved Knockdown, (CON=19)<br>13: Weapon Master(3)<br>14: Weapon Master(4)<br>15: Weapon Master(5): Blind Fight<br>16: Weapon Master(6): CON+1, (CON=20)<br>17: Weapon Master(7)<br>18: Weapon Master(8): Improved Initiative<br>19: Weapon Master(9)<br>20: Weapon Master(10): CON+1, (CON=21)<br>21: Weapon Master(11): Great Strength I, (STR=19)<br>22: Weapon Master(12)<br>23: Weapon Master(13): Epic Weapon Focus: Warhammer<br>24: Weapon Master(14): CON+1, Great Strength II, (STR=20), (CON=22)<br>25: Weapon Master(15)<br>26: Weapon Master(16): Epic Damage Reduction I<br>27: Weapon Master(17): Great Strength III, (STR=21)<br>28: Weapon Master(18): STR+1, (STR=22)<br>29: Weapon Master(19): Epic Damage Reduction II<br>30: Weapon Master(20): Great Strength IV, (STR=23)<br>31: Weapon Master(21)<br>32: Weapon Master(22): STR+1, Epic Damage Reduction III, (STR=24)<br>33: Weapon Master(23): Great Strength V, (STR=25)<br>34: Weapon Master(24)<br>35: Weapon Master(25): Armor Skin<br>36: Weapon Master(26): STR+1, Great Strength VI, (STR=27)<br>37: Weapon Master(27)<br>38: Weapon Master(28): Epic Prowess<br>39: Weapon Master(29): Superior Initiative<br>40: Weapon Master(30): STR+1, (STR=28)<br><br>Hitpoints: 680<br>Skillpoints: 129<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 26/15/21<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +2, Poison: +2<br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 50 (melee), 32 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 17/28<br><br>Skills<br>Discipline 43(52), Intimidate 4(2), Spot 38(37), Tumble 20(21)<br><br>DR 9/-<br><br>Still have a look and see what you think.

He could, but then it wouldn't be a "near-pure" build. There was a suggestion on the General forum to make "pure" builds which would be 40 of a base class, or 10/30 for PrC classes.<br><br>I would actually drop the DR feats. I don't think 9/- DR is enough to make the difference in Epic characters - it's worth it on top of Barb or DwD DR, but not enough by itself. That would let you bump Str to 32, leaving Con at 18 (and 600 HP, still plenty). Gain 2 AB, 2 damage, and 3 Epic Feats. I would also consider using a 2-handed weapon and taking Disarm/Imp Disarm.<br><br>TM

I agree with your sentiments about WMs, they are of limited use I find, particularly bearing in mind the pre-reqs to qualify.<br><br>This was solely to try and create a near pure build, as Mr. Monk pointed out. Saves and AC are major failings, the low ac was attempted to be balanced out by the DR, which would be lower still if I went 2-handed, with a GreatAxe or similar. <br><br>My first take on this was a Human Rogue WM - but you just can't do it, you need the feats from Fighter to qualify by 11th level.<br><br>Having tried with this one, I can safely say it is not recommended. unless you are in a good party, with a strong cleric, bard and arcane caster behind you.<br><br>As much as pure/ near-pure builds go, they do have their limitations. Some more than others (eg. PM, RDD, WM!)  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">

Actually, looking at your char, I really don't think it was that bad.  I think you just tried to take too much at once.<br><br>When playing WM's, which are my favorite class, you have to think specialist.<br><br>Now, I'm no expert character builder, at all.

His hit points are good, as are his skill points.<br><br>His saves, are of course, not good, along with his AC.<br><br>But, I figured, with his high AB, he probably wouldn't be standing there, toe to toe, for too long.<br><br>I then wanted to see how he would do against monsters.  So...<br><br>...with only his mundane armor and scimitar, I took him into the leveler arena.  I easily defeated all 40th level characters I summoned except the rogue, 7 out of 7 times each, but the rogue I only defeated 6 of 7 times.  I then summoned every 30th to 40th level monster, 3 times each.  I won everytime except for the ones that needed magic to hit.<br><br>My Dev Crit, with the scimitar range, really did it's damage.  Most of the kills were 3 hits or less, with approx 6 of every 10 battles ending in 1 hit.<br><br>But in PvP, it is hard to say.  He would Dev Crit alot, but with his low saves and AC, he would be in trouble against spell casters and rogues without backup.  <br><br>But in PvM, I don't see any real trouble at all.  Even against crit immune creatures, because of his high AB, he would be hitting pretty much all the time.<br><br>I would say, that as a specialist fighter, this one can't be beat.<br><br>This is of course, just my opinion, but I have played WM's alot more than any other characters, and I believe that they are the best "specialist" fighter types, bar none.<br><br>Rooker<br>_________________<br>"We fight not for glory, no riches, no honours, but for freedom alone, which no man gives up except with his life."<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Rooker1963 on 02/01/06 03:09</span></i></p>

Rooker: any reason to take those last 2 WM levels? I'd certainly recommend 2 Rogue levels to replace them (not necessarily the last two levels). You'd net yourself the ability to use magic scrolls/items normally barred to you, +8 AC (or +4, if you were cross-classing Tumble in your build), Evasion, and 1d6 sneak attack.<br><br>BTW, try building without Dev Crit (it's disabled on most PWs I've looked at) and see if it's as effective.<br>_________________<br>Captain's Log, Stardate 6051: had trouble sleeping last night... my hiatal hernia is acting up.

Thanks for the feedback all of you. <br><br>I have played around some more on the makeup of this build and have decided to drop the DR feats in Epic levels. It results in a 51 AB, 660 HP, Same AC, Saves are now up to 28/21/25 which are an improvement, particularly the saves, with an extra +6 against spells (Spellcraft and Dwarven racial bonus). <br><br>One thing I did find is that it is simpler to go the Human route, if you want Dev Crit. Going Dwarf makes it difficult, if only because you need to sacrifice 3 of the following: Toughness, IKD, Blind Fight, Iron Will - none of which particularly appeal with playability in mind.<br><br>So here is a revised version.... and unfortunately I have had to take Epic Toughness three times (sighs) - WM epic feats are truly terrible.<br><br>Dwarf<br>Fighter 10, WM 30<br><br>STR: 16 (30)<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 18<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 13<br>CHA: 6<br><br>01: Fighter(1): Dodge, Mobility<br>02: Fighter(2): Weapon Focus: Warhammer<br>03: Fighter(3): Expertise<br>04: Fighter(4): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Warhammer, (STR=17)<br>05: Fighter(5)<br>06: Fighter(6): Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack<br>07: Fighter(7)<br>08: Fighter(8): STR+1, Knockdown, (STR=18)<br>09: Fighter(9): Toughness<br>10: Fighter(10): Improved Critical<br>11: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Warhammer<br>12: Weapon Master(2): STR+1, Improved Knockdown, (STR=19)<br>13: Weapon Master(3)<br>14: Weapon Master(4)<br>15: Weapon Master(5): Blind Fight<br>16: Weapon Master(6): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>17: Weapon Master(7)<br>18: Weapon Master(8): Iron Will<br>19: Weapon Master(9)<br>20: Weapon Master(10): STR+1, (STR=21)<br>21: Weapon Master(11): Great Strength I, (STR=22)<br>22: Weapon Master(12)<br>23: Weapon Master(13): Epic Weapon Focus: Warhammer<br>24: Weapon Master(14): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=24)<br>25: Weapon Master(15)<br>26: Weapon Master(16): Epic Prowess<br>27: Weapon Master(17): Great Strength III, (STR=25)<br>28: Weapon Master(18): STR+1, (STR=26)<br>29: Weapon Master(19): Armor Skin<br>30: Weapon Master(20): Epic Will<br>31: Weapon Master(21)<br>32: Weapon Master(22): STR+1, Epic Toughness I, (STR=27)<br>33: Weapon Master(23): Epic Fortitude<br>34: Weapon Master(24)<br>35: Weapon Master(25): Epic Toughness II<br>36: Weapon Master(26): STR+1, Epic Reflexes, (STR=28)<br>37: Weapon Master(27)<br>38: Weapon Master(28): Epic Toughness III<br>39: Weapon Master(29): Great Strength IV, (STR=29)<br>40: Weapon Master(30): STR+1, (STR=30)<br><br>Hitpoints: 660<br>Skillpoints: 129<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 28/21/25<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +6, Poison: +2<br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 51 (melee), 32 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 17/28<br><br>Skills:<br>Discipline 43(53), Intimidate 4(2), Spellcraft 19(20), Tumble 20(21)<br><br>This should perform a lot better in combat particularly against spellcasters. <br><br>Have to say I'm a lot happier about this fella now, particularly if needed to solo, of course you may want to swap out Toughness for Improved Expertise.. just a thought <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Overall effects of the changes:<br><br>STR up to 30, 2 point increase (thus 1 point extra damage)<br>HP 20 less<br>No DR 9/-<br>Saves<br>Fort +2 (28)<br>Will +6 (21)<br>Reflex +4 (25)<br>Extra +4 to saves from Spellcraft<br>Higher AB - 1 point<br><br>Generally an improvement.<br><br>Thanks again.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 02/01/06 13:53</span></i></p>

If you think Toughness is expendable, and feel that Epic toughness isnæt good feats, swap Toughness for WF: Battleaxe, and Epic Toughness I, II for WoC: Battleaxe and EWF: Battleaxe. Gives you another type of damage at same AB, but it does lower damage. And you lose 80 hp's.

Grim's suggestion is a nice one altough cheesey <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  Also , would the build be less pure with one (or more for save optimization) FTR lvl in epic for EWS? Keeping the 10/30 lvl split, I find it makes even more sense concept wise. Man, it's supposed to be a <b>weapon master</b> and without EWS he's not able to squeeze the maximum possible damage out of his chosen weapon...not really master like<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

A good idea Grim, and very worthwhile, particularly with some DR types about.<br>Completely optional mind you!<br><br>As far as the pure builds go, I take it as 30 levels for Prestige Classes as that is their max, as 40 is for a base class.<br><br>Maybe I'm wrong though .....<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 02/01/06 16:07</span></i></p>

I didn't mean to chancge the lvl split (10 FTR/30 WM) but just to move one (better two, saves wise) lvls of fighter in epic for EWS. As I said before, it the result would be a better WM, even concept wise (and pure builds are about concept/being iconic, it would seem)

I'm officialy dumb, thank you for reminding me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Then I'd definitely go for the 12/28 split for the same reasons above...but that's just me<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 02/01/06 16:25</span></i></p>
