hi. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>I am trying to build a decent rogue with 1 level SD, and not more than 10 levels of fighter, for example R29/F10/SD1.<br>Obviously, four levels of fighter have to be pre-epic to get one more attack per round.<br>My problem is, that i always end up with Self-Concealment IV.<br><br>i want at least the following feats:<br>- Ambidexterity<br>- Weapon Finesse<br>- Dodge<br>- Mobility<br>- Two Weapon Fighting<br>- Knockdown<br>- Improved Knockdown<br>- Improved two-weapon-fighting<br>- Weapon Focus<br>- Weapon Specialization<br>- Defensive Roll<br>- Improved Evasion<br>- minimum amount of great dex feats to achieve SC V<br>- Slippery Mind<br>- Epic Weapon Focus<br>- Epic Weapon Specialization<br>- Epic Dodge<br>- Self Concealment V<br><br>now my question:<br>given 18 dexterity at level 1, is it possible for a human to get all those feats AND to get EWS in the twenties?<br>might it even be possible as a hafling?<br><br>could a human fit in blind fight and/or crippling strike?<br><br>I've tried it now the whole day with a character-building-mod, but i always end at SC IV when taking EWS relatively early.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By dust7 on 03/18/07 23:06</span></i></p>

I'm new here, but I'd advise taking 5 levels of SD instead of 1. Many reasons for doing so, but since you're shooting for ED and SC5 you'll want the class feats that come along with 5 levels of SD. Also, taking 4 SD pre-epic will aid leveling while not causing a loss of BAB (by taking a sole level of SD).<br><br>Also, if you're going human you won't want to stretch your starting stats by putting Dex at 18. You may want to consider an Elf Rogue 31/SD 5/CoT 4. Elves make great rogues because of their racial abilities.<br><br>Or you could go Halfling Rogue/SD/Ftr. <br><br>Me? I'd go Dwarven Rogue 29/SD 5/Ftr 6 or something like that.<br><br>Have you used Pulse Cap's build search tool?

Yeah, right, you're new Kaliban....... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Why don't you just try to build a Fighter10/Rogue29/SD1 and see if it is possible to get all those feats. Should be a simple task to try. <br><br>Unlike Kaliban I rarely see a reason to take more than 1 Sd level in a rogue-heavy build. You spend 4 levels to get a feat you can just as easily get by taking 4 rogue levels, and give up 2 sneak dice and skillpoints. Taking Fighter7/SD1/Rogue12 pre-epic keeps the 4 attacks and opens Epic dodge at lvl 21 if you are halfling or elf with starting DEX at 20.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

The reason to take the 5 SD levels is to delay fighter bpnus feats into Epic levels. If you take 7 fighter levels pre-epic, you trade an Epic feat for a pre-epic feat. You already have a "spare" pre-epic feat (I took Iron Will, but you could go for Stealthy or Called Shot). Another pre-epic feat doesn't help much, but losing the Epic feat hurts (note that it's a fighter epic feat you lose, so you have to drop Epic Prowess or Armor Skin).<br><br>As a human, you can do it, but you need to take 2 more Great Dex feats. This will cost you 2 Epic feats (I recommend Skill Mastery and your choice of Epic Prowess or Armor Skin). You gain a pre-epic feat, but as I noted above it's not that useful (Luck of Heroes, maybe). You can also do it as an Elf, but there is an XP penalty for much of the build (not an issue if it's a level 40 server, and the size will help for getting in those IKDs).<br><br>TM

Actually, looking back at the original post, he wants to go with the TWF feats. In that case, go Human, take the 7 fighter levels pre-epic, and use the 2 additional feats and the "optional" one for Ambi, TWF, and ITWF. I would probably sacrifice Armor Skin in Epic, since between your high AC, ED, and SCV you can probably lose 2 AC better than 1 AB.<br><br>TM

thanks for the good general advice.<br>i can fit in all those feats when building the character in a level-up module, but my original question was if i could take EWS in the early epic levels without losing SCV.<br><br>i am not that good at the theoretical aspects of building a character, since i don't understand all of the dnd rules yet.<br>I always level a character up to 40 in a module, make a writeup and then look how i can tweak it.<br>But as i mentioned i were not able get EWS in the twenties and SC5 this way.<br><br>This is because i hoped someone here with more knowledge about the game or dnd rules could show me how this can work.

Here is the closest I was able to get - you end up losing both Epic Prowess and Armor skin, since you need all of the general feats for Great Dex and SCV. You could drop 2-4 Rogue levels for Fighter levels, lose Crippling Strike, and pick up one or both of them. Will cost you 1-2 sneak attack dice. You will need to take the extra fighter levels before level 37 so you don't move any Rogue bonus feats to before level 37 (which is the earliest you can take SC). Note that going to Human and adding Rogue levels means you now have skill points to burn.<br><br>Compared to the Halfling single-wielding build, this one loses 4 AB (1 from Epic Prowess, 1 from Small Stature, 2 from dual-wielding), and 3 AC (1 from Small Stature, and 2 from Armor Skin). Taking 4 more fighter levels will make it a loss of 3 AB and 1 AC.<br><br>TM<br><br>Rogue(29), Fighter(10), Shadowdancer(1), Human<br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 18 (32)<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 402<br>Skillpoints: 411<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/15/33<br>BAB: 26<br>AB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 37 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 29/30<br>Disable Trap 43(47), Hide 43(54), Move Silently 43(54), Open Lock 43(54), Search 39(41), Set Trap 43(56), Tumble 40(51), UMD 41(40)<br><br>Disable Trap 43(47), Hide 43(54), Move Silently 43(54), Open Lock 43(54), Search 39(41), Set Trap 43(56), Tumble 40(51), UMD 41(40), 76 left over!<br><br>L01: Ro(1): Ambidexterity, Dodge<br>L02: F(1): Weapon Finesse<br>L03: Ro(2): Weapon Focus: Shortsword, Ro: (Evasion)<br>L04: F(2): DEX+1, Knockdown, (DEX=19)<br>L05: F(3)<br>L06: F(4): Mobility, Weapon Specialization: Shortsword<br>L07: Ro(3): Ro: (Uncanny Dodge I)<br>L08: SD(1): DEX+1, SD: (Hide in Plain Sight), (DEX=20)<br>L09: Ro(4): Improved Knockdown<br>L10: Ro(5)<br>L11: Ro(6)<br>L12: Ro(7): DEX+1, Blind Fight, (DEX=21)<br>L13: Ro(8)<br>L14: Ro(9)<br>L15: Ro(10): Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Evasion<br>L16: F(5): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>L17: Ro(11)<br>L18: Ro(12): Toughness<br>L19: F(6): Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>L20: F(7): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br>L21: Ro(13): Great Dexterity I, Defensive Roll, (DEX=24)<br>L22: Ro(14)<br>L23: Ro(15)<br>L24: Ro(16): DEX+1, Great Dexterity II, Epic Dodge, (DEX=26)<br>L25: F(8): Epic Weapon Focus: Shortsword<br>L26: F(9)<br>L27: F(10): Great Dexterity III, Epic Weapon Specialization: Shortsword, (DEX=27)<br>L28: Ro(17): DEX+1, (DEX=28)<br>L29: Ro(18)<br>L30: Ro(19): Great Dexterity IV, Crippling Strike, (DEX=29)<br>L31: Ro(20)<br>L32: Ro(21): DEX+1, (DEX=30)<br>L33: Ro(22): Self Concealment I<br>L34: Ro(23)<br>L35: Ro(24): Self Concealment II<br>L36: Ro(25): DEX+1, Self Concealment III, (DEX=31)<br>L37: Ro(26)<br>L38: Ro(27)<br>L39: Ro(28): Self Concealment IV, Self Concealment V<br>L40: Ro(29): DEX+1, (DEX=32)

Took another shot at it, with the Halfling.
