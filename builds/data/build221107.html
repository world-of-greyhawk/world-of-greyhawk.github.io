I think this is a strong build. You definitely won't get hit much. A question for you, why so many levels in assassin? With only 9 levels of monk you miss out on immunity to poison and spell resistance. I understand you’d get a huge death attack bonus, but is that really worth while? My understanding of the death attack is that it works like sneak attack. It only kicks in when the target is flatfooted, stunned/dazed or there are two attackers. Also you might want to take one of your monk levels at the end so that you can get more discipline.

Some of the veteran assassin builders recommend 25 or so as the :minimum: number of levels to be effective.  Try it out--it's better than you may think.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif"> <br><br>Cool build idea, btw.
