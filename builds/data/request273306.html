Hi I have jjust joined the guild and, therefore, a little new to this.  So here's my question, I use an rp server which allows me to get to level 60.  The character I play is an elf avariel which is a lvl 11 cleric using fire and earth as my domains, I have also got 6 lvls in druid.  Could anyone advise me on how to get the best out of this build? I really don't want the monk build in there, even though i realise the wis adds to the ac of the character.<br><br>The Server itself is a low-magic one, as you have to craft the armour, weaps and items yourself.<br><br>any suggestions, ideas would be most apprectiated

Cleric 11, Druid 39, Shifter 10.<br><br>Take Outsider shape and drop Maximized Ice Storms on people, places, things, small rocks, bird nests, pocket lint, etc...<br><br>With 39 druid levels, you'll have (maximized) 18 blunt and 90 cold damage in an AoE spell.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>And, if you start now... you can qualify for the build.<br><br>Just make sure to take your 10th shifter level on a level that would grant a feat, and that you have the required wisdom.<br><br>39 is a good level for the Ice Storm Spell.

thanks for that, I'll definately consider it, but I was hoping to try and stay more cleric than druid due to the RP purposes of the build.  As the mod that I use is still in it's infancy, I was hoping to bring a ray of hope into the world.  There are a couple of Druids already on the server, but the cleric/druid is not common there.<br><br>Thoughts and comments are very much appreciated though.

Awesome thanks for that Finn, I have just read the build, for the last 20 lvls I am assuming that they would be cleric.<br><br>If that's the case then all the mobs and players had better watch out <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">

Yes, it's a cool build. Note, however, that due to having 3 base classes you will receive XP penalty unless you go with more Monk and less Clc.<br>_________________<br>" -- They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then it's night once more."<br><br> - Pozzo in Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett

Well ATM I am recieving a 20% xp penalty, even though the avariel's alleged prefered class is cleric, which is kind of confusing.  I am trying to reach the creactor of the server to see whether he can adjust the scripts on this as I am losing around 2.5k xp per lvl.<br><br>This is also my first real cleric build so I am trying to get it as close to right as I can first time, cuz relvling a lvl 60 toon, IMO, would be a royal pain in the butt.<br><br>anyway thanks for all your help on this, I shall be posting a barb build as soon as I find the paperwork and sort out the numbers.

I like the idea of a level 60 Jormundgandr build, but I wouldn't just add Cleric.<br><br>First, Monk serves several purposes - Wis AC, unarmed attacks, and skill dumping. Given the extra levels, it would be nice to take some monk earlier, and periodically for skill dumps. I would take 1 at level 22, then again every 5th or 10th level for skill dumps. You get the attacks and Wis AC much earlier that way, and if you take 6 you get IKD for free, and 9 gets you Imp. Evasion, both nice bonuses.<br><br>I would also take some more Druid levels - pushing it to 20 gets you the full Druid spell list, and more casts per day and duration as well. The only thing you lose on the Cleric spells is SP and duration, and you aren't focussed on offensive spell casting and the duration is plenty long already.<br><br>So I would aim for something like Druid 20/ Cleric 34/ Monk 6, or Druid 20/Cleric 30/Monk 10.<br><br>TM

Thanks monk, I was already thinking along those lines, if and when I get to lvl 60 I'll post the final build, hopeful;ly it should be a tough little dragon <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">
