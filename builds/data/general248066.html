Concealment doesn't stacks, no matter the value, (i.e. 25 + 25 won't give you 50%) the highest active is the one that works. As Finn said, there is nothing that will increase it over 50%... although I recall once fighting against a 75% Concealment (I'm pretty sure I wasn't drunk), of course, it was a NPC, so don't even try it.
