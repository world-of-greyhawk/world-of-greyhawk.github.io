You may be able to get thundering rage - you've missed 2 feats at level 9 (a general and CoT bonus) so I'd suggest you move Blind Fight to pre-epic so you end up being able to use it most of pre-epic (concealed enemies, help combat having to fight in Darkness) and drop Power Attack/Cleave which is less useful as you go up in levels. This will also let you get to WM earlier. I'd also suggest you take Heavy Armor prof. at level 1 rather than so late - you'll want it much ealier than you took it.<br><br>Also, how did you allocate skillpoints? Didn't look like you crossclassed into Tumble, nor took Armor Skin. Your ending AC is low so I'd suggest getting those, and using a shield.<br><br>Anyhow, nice first build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

Oh dang at level 9 you should take dodge and mobility to get the requirements for WM<br><br>So level 9 CoT take dodge and mobility<br><br>Thanks for your comment Jennalee, but unfortunaly i cant drop power attack/cleave because you need it to get CoT. I tried putting in heavy armor profiency earlier, but its not possible. All the feats before level 12 are needed to advance in the two other classes, begin CoT and WM. <br><br>As for the skills (sorry forgot that) i crossclassed into tumble for the obvious reason. Maxed out discipline and intimidate. Ive put the leftovers in heal. (no heal potions available on the server i play on)<br><br>As for Armor skin, really love that feat and would certainly want to include it in my build, but how...i have absolutely no idea, i dont seem to have enough room left to put in that feat. Unless i drop a GS, but i dont know if thats worth it. Epic skill focus intimidate is another feat i badly wanted, but couldnt fit that one in either <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tionus on 12/01/05 15:23</span></i></p>

While you're re-building I'd suggest changing to scimitar and shield, the extra strength damage from a two handed weapon is nice, but this character is hurting badly in the AC department.  The scimitar's extended crit range backed with WM bonuses will make up a little for the lost damage bonus.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

God of War wielding a toothpick and hiding behind a towershield <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br><br>Why should he rebuild his character? Besides the missing Dodge/Mobility feats at level 9 there's nothing wrong with the build.

And indeed there are mistakes... epic CoT gets bonus feats at 14th and 18th lvl only, so one should either drop EP and epic thoughness, or otherwise drop two GS and keep EP but change epic toughness for something else (ESF: Taunt is my suggestion). The last variant seems better IMO.<br>Cheers,<br>Kail
