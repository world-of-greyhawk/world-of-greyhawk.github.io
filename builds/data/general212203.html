Hey everyone,<br><br>I have been playing on low - medium magic servers for years now and I thought I'd try something new.  I found the Final Fantasy module by Rey someone and it's awesome.  The only problem is none of my builds work anymore!  It's an ultra-high magic server with some interesting quirks.  You can't rest anywhere bun in the inns (just like FF1), you fight swarms of monsters very frequently, you have practically no gear to start with, and there are ultimate bosses that have been deemed unbeatable by the DMs.<br><br>I was playing through with Pale Drake for a little while and doing decent.  I had made it all the way up to level 12 (by the way, I still only had a rapier and a chain shirt - the starting gear) when I was ambushed by ogres and killed.  Now, it's not permadeath but I play that way sometimes if I'm feeling especially masochistic.<br><br>But now, I need some help from the community.  What build would help on a server with +15 or higher armor for SALE!?!  I mean, where do I start?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>King Harbromm

The Final Fantasy server is in the "Action" area under "Final Fantasy."  You need a hak and the CEP to play there, though.  Here's the link for the hak:<br><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=modules.Detail&amp;id=3778" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br>I would suggest downloading the entire module of 321 MB.  It's a large download but that's because they took a LOT of music from the various Final Fantasies and put it in the module.  It's really worth it.  Just imagine the Diablo II module in all it's glory - just Final Fantasy instead.<br><br>King Harbromm
