I havent found one so far, and thought a RDD class would be needed to make it, but how to go about making an elf which get the full advantage of a mighty bow, and still gets enough dex to be able to hit anyhting with it, any ideas on the build?<br><br>-Alis

on second thought Zyn, it doesnt look as good. If you try it out, you will find that there is no chance that you at lvl 5 can go RDD, earliest possible is 6th lvl, ill give you more info on the build problems as i encounter them the hard way, i tried this build out in a PW, so this is my first encounter with a problem, btw i chose another lvl of bard instead of the unavailible RDD, which isnt surprising i guess.

Ah yes, sorry about that. It was more of a typo than anything. Just push them all up a level and drop the Bard level at 32. Note that I haven't installed the new patch so this char is untested.<br><br>Edit: Mmm, on second thoughts, drop both Bard levels 27 and 32 and take a Bard level at 20th. That will avoid a drop in BAB. So level 20 will be 10AA/6Bard/4RDD with an AB of 17.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Zyn248 on 10/08/04 00:13</span></i></p>

You were always able to take the Dev Crit and Overwhelming Crit feats for bows. They just had no effect - testing the build doesn't require the new patch.

I see. Testing something you know doesn't work. Good idea. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

Testing in the sense of if it's buildable, yes.  You can still physically take the devastating critical feats for bows.  They just won't actually DO anything until the patch.  So yes, you can in fact test out the build in the sense of making the thing. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>"Intelligence is knowing a tomato is a fruit; Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad."

Yeah I know. It did come with a disclaimer. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>I usually chart out a char before testing it. If the build doesn't look that good on paper, I don't bother testing it. This particular build is borderline. On some Mods it might work very well. <br><br>This build will have only a 10% of getting a crit threat and most of the epic monsters on my PW will either only fail on a 1, or they are crit immune. That is a pretty small chance concidering all the useless feats you need to get it.<br><br>That said, the guy was looking for a dev crit bowyer build and I had this lying around. It's workable. I don't see a rush of alternate builds.

I stand corrected. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Oh BTW, I've updated the char sheet. Dev crit is available at 29th (due to dev crit being an AA bonus feat).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Zyn248 on 10/11/04 04:33</span></i></p>
