I am looking for a build with three classes with a decent attack and AC. I want him to wield a long and short sword to make it more rp believeable.<br><br>Idealy I would think it would have to be a Fighter/WM/Monk build so as to get a decent AC. I realize that going ranger I will get the required Two weapon feats for free but I will miss out on other things. The best I came up with so far was a Fighter 10, Weaponmaster 22, and CoT level 8. I miss out on 4 AC from tumble with this and all of my shield AC if I decide to dual wield. But I have the advantages of using a shield and improved save throws. Also I get a lot of feats and a very good strength bonus.<br><br>So I guess I am looking for a good Build with Fighter WM and Monk to off set the loss of shield AC. Also not taking Monk until epic so as to avoid losing an AB point. Also I want him strength based so as to get Dev crit with both.<br><br>Alright i think I rambled enough. Thanks for you time<br><br>Tal.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TalionRev on 03/06/06 18:38</span></i></p>

May I ask a question? Why do you want to use Monk? If you will be wielding either long and shortswords, or longsword and shield, and presumably wearing heavy armor, is it just for the Tumble dump?<br><br>If so, may I suggest instead taking either 2 levels of Rogue (gets you Tumble dumps, UMD dumps, and evasion), or a level or two of Bard (Tumble, UMD, weak song and can use all scrolls).<br><br>If you planned on using Kamas to get the Monk Unarmed Attack Progresion, I would say to go with monk, but wearing armor and using swords means the only things you gain from Monk are Cleave (and you have enough fighter levels to take that anyway), Evasion (can get from 2 levels of Rogue), and the Tumble dump. <br><br>The other thing I suggest is picking just 1 light weapon to dual-wield. Use 2 shortswords instead of longsword and shortsword. That way you can easily switch between single-wielding or dial-wielding, and you only need to invest in 1 set of feats for WF, WS, WoC, EWF, EWS, IC, OC, DC. Trying to get all of those for 2 weapons will chew up a LOT of feats....<br><br>If you do want to have 2 weapons, I recommend making one a single-handed high-threat range weapon (Scim or Rapier), and taking all 8 feats. Make the other a 2-handed weapon for use against crit-resistant mobs, and skip IC, OC, and DC. That way the 1.5x str bonus will make up for the lack of crits. You also skip the TWF feats that way, but with 2 sets of weapons to max out you won't really have room for them anyway.<br><br>TM

Hmm thanks for the post. You have a very good point there with using the two handed weapon as the second weapon.<br>That would be a really good idea, but I was also thinking of it for rp reasons. The reason I would be going monk is so that I wouldn't need to wear heavy armor. The wisdom would make up for the lack of Heavy armor AC and the dex would make up for the shield, also allowing me to dual wield with 6 attacks a round. <br>With this build though you could save some feats and use a Double axe or sword and get the same result.

I'm sorry if this is an inappropriate place to ask this, but what is PnP?<br><br>Also, I'm partial to dual-wielding too, but wish there was a way to do scimitars better...they look so cool, but no 10 att/rd, no small weapon for off hand, so more to hit penalties...don't think the better crit range or coolness factors can make up for the disadvantages.

PnP is Paper 'n Pencil - or the original D&amp;D. NWN is based on D&amp;D version 3.0, but sort of loosely based (they made a number of changes to make it easier for them to turn into a computer game). One of those changes is that being a monk simply applies the monk attack progression to your normal BAB. In PnP, monks have a separate Flurry of Blows BAB that is based on monk levels only (levels in other classes do not add to it, except a few prestige classes specifically for monks). <br><br>Also, about dual-wielding - note that the 6 attacks per round (7 hasted) can be had with any class combination, monk does not increase it with weapons other than kamas. With kamas it goes up to 9 (10 hasted). <br><br>So again, for that first build, if you take monk I would dual-wield kamas to get the best use out of the class. If you aren't going to use kamas, I would take Rogue or Bard as the 3rd class, and wear heavy armor (it was already noted that the Wisdom is unlikely to make up for the armor in this build). And for any build, I would probably dual-wield the same weapon in both hands, or use a double weapon, rather than take all the feats for 2 weapons.<br><br>About the Scim question - if you want to dual-wield something with an extended crit range, use Kukris. Scim's have a larger penalty, as you noticed.<br><br>TM
