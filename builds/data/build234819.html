The Darkwall Defender is the dowdy champion of a dark dwarven god.  Well trained in his deity's chosen weapon and able to resist a great deal of damage, he can prove a balanced defender and attacker.  He is strongest when backed into a corner or guarding a narrow mountain pass, which is when he enables his powerful defensive stance for extra power and defense.  In addition, he can call upon the power of his deity by way of his great charisma and devote that power to either defense or offense as is needed.<br><br>Darkwall Defender<br>Fighter 8/Blackguard 5/Dwarven Defender 27<br><br>Dwarf, LE<br><br>Playable PvM 1-40<br><br><b>Stats</b><br>Str 16 (21)<br>Dex 14<br>Con 10<br>Wis 8<br>Int 12<br>Cha 14 (26)<br><br><br><b>Leveling</b><br><br>1 Ftr 1: PA, Cleave<br>2 Ftr 2: Dodge<br>3 Ftr 3: Toughness<br>4 Ftr 4: Exotic Weapon Prof*, STR=17 <br>5 Ftr 5 <br>6 Ftr 6: WF, WS<br>7 Ftr 7<br>8 DwD 1: STR=18<br>9 DwD 2: Knockdown<br>10 BG 1 <br>11 BG 2<br>12 BG 3: Divine Might, CHA=15<br>13 DwD 3<br>14 DwD 4<br>15 BG 4: Divinie Shield<br>16 DwD 5: CHA=16<br>17 DwD 6<br>18 DwD 7: Improved Crit*<br>19 DwD 8<br>20 DwD 9: CHA=17<br>21 DwD 10: Great Cha I (CHA=18)<br>22 DwD 11 <br>23 DwD 12<br>24 DwD 13: Great Cha II (CHA=19), CHA=20<br>25 DwD 14: EWF<br>26 Ftr 8: EWS<br>27 DwD 15: Great Cha III (CHA=21)<br>28 DwD 16: CHA=22<br>29 DwD 17<br>30 DwD 18: Great Cha IV (CHA=23), Armor Skin<br>31 DwD 19<br>32 DwD 20: CHA=24<br>33 DwD 21: Great Cha V (CHA=25)<br>34 DwD 22: Epic Prowess <br>35 DwD 23<br>36 DwD 24: Great Str I (STR=19), CHA=26<br>37 DwD 25<br>38 DwD 26: Energy Resistance I: Fire<br>39 DwD 27: Great Str I (STR=20)<br>40 BG 5: STR=21 %<br><br>* - Possibly replace with another feat.<br>% - Last level of Blackguard taken to dump points into Taunt skill.<br><br><b>Skills</b> - 129 Total Points<br>Concentration 36<br>Discipline 43 (48)<br>Hide 5 cc<br>Taunt 40 (48)<br><br>Max HP 494<br><br>AC 22 in Mundane Chainmail w/ Tower Shield, +1 Dodge Bonus v.

Looks good. I like it.  It's ashame about that 10 Con.  You could start with 12 by lowering Str to 15, and then keep Epic Feat selection the same.  I would probablt take the HPs and the +1Fort save for the life of the build over a level 39 ESF Feat.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

That's the same thing I did, I just said CHA because you don't need CHA when you start, but STR is much more useful <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm

It's a great build, however, let me try to improve it.<br><br>Let's see, to get the 18/- Damage Resistance you need only 26 Dwarven Defender levels, not 27, I think you can gain some benefit if you drop 1 level from Dwarven Defender and 1 from Blackguard to increase fighter to 10, thus gaining an extra feat, I would go for Blind-Fight, but do as you prefer. You would lose the skill dump on taunt...... so, it's not a win/win advice.<br><br>As for the odd STR at the end, I know of another solution similar to what Finn said in his first post, lower DEX to 13 instead of CHA, since you'll be wearing full plate, and 14 is not needed, just keep 13 for Dodge, although you will lose 1 Reflex, and use it to increase CON (11), take CON and at the end (12), instead of STR, that way keeping STR high on lower levels and also ending with 20, anyway, Grizz's option is better, since you would retain the Reflex, my CON progression enters too late but makes STR enter a little bit earlier, it's just another option... since I wanted to say something.<br><br>It's a cool build, but do you have a specific weapon in mind? I mean, this way everone that would like to use your build could choose easily, yeah, but you've got to have some preferences, and I'm curious about how you visualize it.<br>You take exotic, so I would take a scythe, since I like scythes, but you could well use something else, or shield and a bastard sword (or katana) for AC, or drop exotic for a greatsword, or another one handed with shield.<br><br>I don't think Improved Critical should be a possibly replaceable feat though.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/24/06 23:11</span></i></p>

Why lower DEX, when you can lower CHA for no penalty whatsoever. If you start at<br><br>16 STR<br>14 DEX<br>12 CON<br>12 INT<br>08 WIS<br>13 CHA<br><br>and end with 20 STR, 26 CHA by taking GSTR I and GCHA 6, and placing 3 stat raises on STR and 7 on CHA. I still think it's the best solution if you're willing to break 500 unbuffed HP.<br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm

Oh right, just one more thing, if you do like to take the feat with the fighter level change, the remaining skill points lost on Taunt would go well on Tumble for 4 AC, so it's not really bad, and come on, only 2 HP is nothing, it won't be the difference between winning or losing and 1 defensive stance less is not so great either, just rest once in a while, you still have a respectable amount of them.
