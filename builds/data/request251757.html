Was thinking of doing a Monk build that was completely (or almost completely) spell resistant from evil Bigby's casting mages.<br><br>My initial idea was a duel Kama wielding (1. Good magical kamas are available in this world and 2. Darkfire/Flame Weapon/Improve Crit/Keen are all things fists aren't) with (of course) as many of those epic ISR feats as possible.<br><br>First one was a 37 Monk/2 Fighter/1 Rogue (last one for skill dump for UMD).<br><br>Another one was very similar, this time 37 Monk/1 Fighter/2 SD (for Uncanny Dodge and cheesy HIPS).<br><br>Then I thought .. since it is likely to be a DEX build, go for maybe slightly less chance (though I haven't figgered how much less) of spells getting though .. get slightly lower SR and go for Epic Dodge.<br><br>Something like 35 Monk/5 SD.  Or 34 Monk/5 SD/1 Rogue or something such as that.<br><br>What are your thoughts on this SR monk build thing?<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Joe

This was the build I came up with, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "196360", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Mage Bane</a>.  If you can get arrows with good extra damage types, you can forget about increasing the charisma and just increase dexterity which will give you a good ranged AB.  If you can get a holy avenger you can go strength based and melee instead.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
