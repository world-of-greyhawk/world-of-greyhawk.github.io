In the thread about my Drakebow build ( <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "203520", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> ), fernandooa mentioned that he always wishes, upon seeing Devestating Crit archers, that they had Epic Dodge.  An exercise sprang to mind:  Is it possible to have both.  The answer is, "Yes, but just barely."

In theory, I fixed it, but the current version is, as yet, untested.  Don't make this on a multiplayer server until you've checked it out.  I intend to test this version of the build tonight or tomorrow, at which point I'll put the detailed stats up, but I don't have time right now.

Just so you know, Shadow Archer is actually already the name of one of the more famous builds in the guild, by Syrath.<br><br>Also, you currently have Weapon Focus (Longbow) taken on your first Arcane Archer level at level 9.  But that's a prerequisite for Arcane Archer, so you'd have to already have it.  You'll need to move Shadowdancer level 2 earlier, to character level 9, and take weapon focus there, then start your AA levels at level 10.<br><br>It also would probably make the character more playable in early epic if you take a lot more of your epic Arcane Archer levels earlier.  You can keep all the feats the same (except moving the Great Dex feats to your 14th and 18th AA levels), and get your AB higher sooner.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 08/02/05 02:18</span></i></p>

As soon as I saw this I thought, "Uh-oh."  It's an honest mistake, though, as there are so many builds these days that you really have to dedicate 30 minutes just to ensure that A).

An elven rogue(13)/wizard(1)/AA(26) could get Devastating Critical, Epic Dodge and Rapid Shot and Epic Weapon Focus.<br><br>Plus you could start with 'normal' stats (16/15+2/12-2/10/12/10). With these stats you would end up with STR/DEX 25 though.<br><br>No HIPS of course, no slippery mind, but 7d6 sneak attack, better AB and more damage.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.Detail&amp;id=856" target="_blank">Character Build Calculator</a>(works with Excel, Open Office) 2.83: updated to NWN 1.69.

I'd tend to agree with others that a rogue version would be much stronger. With that you could basically have the saem build but the potential for sneak attack damage as well as more skill points.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>
