hi there. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">       <br><br>i am searching for a build for a server with the following qualities (i am trying to be as specific as i can):<br><br>- mobs do a lot of damage<br>- mobs have a lot of AB<br>- mobs have high HP<br>- mobs have medium AC, a naked AB of about 38-40 should be enough for a melee-character<br>- mobs have a high discipline score, don't expect to knockdown the highend-monsters<br>--&gt; defense is king, but if you lack offense, it will take you forever to kill bosses etc.<br>- bosses have true seeing and are often immune to sneaks<br>- if possible, an UMD score of at least 55 will help to wear most of the best cross-class items<br>- most characters i have seen have improved expertise and epic skill focus: UMD<br>- all clerics take plant and trickery as domains for +5AC and improved invisibility<br>- harm works an most non-bosses<br>- mid-high magic, consider +8 weapons and about +5 armor, high end items giving a bit more (for exeample there is one certain cloak with +10 deflection, but it is really hard to get, and a +10 cloth armor).<br>a lot of weapons have some extra critical damage or some magic damage on them.<br>there are no immunities on items.<br>- AC should be at least 85-90 with equipment, buffs and improved expertise.<br>- there are no full heal potions from merchants available<br>- the most "efficient" characters i have seen were dex based Rogue2/Fighter10/WM28 dual wielding rapiers<br>- dex based, dual wielding RDDs seem quite efficient, too. (i tried to build one myself, but it did not turn out too well)<br>- devastating critical is disabled<br>- no alignment shifts (good -&gt; evil is possible)<br>- i want something different, because there are already too many R/F/WM out there<br><br>if there's any information lacking please ask.<br>thanks for the help.<br><br>greetings <br>dusty<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By dust7 on 03/27/07 12:22</span></i></p>

(love the details you gave, I wish more people would follow your lead.)<br><br>My initial reaction to <br><br>(quote)<br>- mobs do a lot of damage<br>- mobs have a lot of AB<br>- mobs have high HP<br>[\quote]<br><br>was "Then don't melle them!".<br><br>I'd probably suggest a Monk Rogue build that would have Epic Dodge and SCv if possible.<br><br>Prehaps a gnome caster using Evard's Black Tentacles and other such AoE spells.<br><br>Since mobs have a medium AC, this might actually be favorable to the Shifter's mediocre AB.  The Epic Drow has a nice On-Hit slow effect.  You could make a Drow Weapon Master, or a Dwarven Defender Shifter who maskerades as an Epic Drow.  The lack of full Heal potions would hurt a Shifter.<br><br>A Weapon Master Risen Lord would do some nice crit damage.  Make sure you have a stunning Keen weapon underneath.  I like Courtesan Blade (dagger) for that.<br><br>As a Shifter Weapon Master, after you get your desired form, all other levels should be used for Weapon Master to increase your AB.  (A valid argument could be made for getting better Druid spells too.)<br><br>===<br><br>From the sounds of the monsters, I think your tactic should be to find a way to disable them and then chip away at them. Pure mellee battles sound like they would take awhile and be at high risk.  <br><br>===<br><br>Tell me, do player spells affect party members?  Rak Ice Storm for instance, Evards Tentacles, etc...

Hmmm, you've tried spellswords? they can work good to add damage from buffs (True Strike and Flame Weapon are most common to deal high damage) and still go DEX based with also some buffs for AC... I guess you could get to make a Rogue 13 / Sorcerer 23 / Fighter 4 with Epic Dodge and Epic Warding, which might work fine.<br><br>What about ranged? heavy Arcane Archers have both high AB and damage (and are easy to make/play), so net damage inflicted is very high, with not too bad AC and low HP, but you can better flee or party tankers, archers normally work pretty good although I'm unsure how much "mobs have high HP" will affect.

i've made some changes to the build but it seems i can't figure out building him properly this way.<br><br>maybe one of the more experienced builders knows how to make him specialize in a martial weapon, losing still spell (for blind fight) and starting with int 12, taking the expertise feats after the RDD int boost.<br><br>this way i could start with 16 str and 16 charisma, for a free epic feat at level 40.
