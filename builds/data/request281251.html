I was wondering what you all thought was the best class combo to kill a mage in PvP, that isnt.. well a class with magic. I will have Druid being an exception because they can be shifter, which I heard Rakasha had good spell risistence. <br><br>But is there something better that could help me. Lets say a monk with spell risistence. The server I play on doesnt have any rules against certain feats, so that is not much of an issue. I know the character IS kinda vague, but I do not know how to narrow it down anymore.<br><br>Thank you, hope there is something you can find for me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

Shields, yes: 1 round/level, unless extended (or recast, as you say; but again, can't cast if on their backs -- besides, and regardless, if doing more damage to them on hit than what their shield does back to you (and say, get some acid resistance or something <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      ... not an issue, so long as when you hit, you're dealing the damage (and reason why monks sometimes work, sometimes don't--all that apr/flurry and little damage usually means for them suicide, but not a str.based warrior).

The best way to kill a mage is with another mage. The trick is to be the first one to get your Time stop off to cast Mord's Disjunction followed by a Bigby's spell wins. Not very exciting, but it's reality. Almost any non-mage build is in trouble against a prepared Exalted Sorc or similar. Smite only works if they are evil, stealth only works if they haven't cast True Seeing on rest, melee only works if they don't cast Mestil's, melee or ranged don't work once they cast Epic Warding. That leaves spells. <br><br>The other thing that can work is a cleric - Harm, followed by any Cause Wounds spell will take them out in 1 round, or Implosion, as long as they don't have a spell shield up (and of course if they haven't used Bigby's or Time Stop on you first).<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 08/20/07 14:21</span></i></p>

Thanks, Mantis: <br><br>Yeah, Merlin just tested that properly for us, as it's not what the wiki says; wouldn't be the first time the Wiki's wrong, sadly (although we're pretty good here I think about fixing and updating stuff when we catch it, so it's pretty dependable overall; problem is right now it's locked/unavailable for editing, but once it's open again, I'm sure Merlin will get around to tweaking it for us (ain't that right, Merlin?
