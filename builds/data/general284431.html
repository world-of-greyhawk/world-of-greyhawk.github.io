I don't know how it works nor I care much, but I know one thing that could perhaps help on this (since it wasn't mentioned above): Notice that when you shift, save, and then load, when you load your character is already shifted (there is no re-shift action), so all your merging items are not counted, it's like if you had no equipment at all (I hate that because I always lose my Haste from my armor when I load). I think you do get the merging items "re-equipped" from the action of shifting, and thus when loading an already shifted character the action of shifting is never performed and the action of equipping isn't either, and when it tries to read again if there are items equipped the game finds none. I wouldn't really know how is the process of merging the magical abilities from equipment, frankly, it doesn't matter.<br><br>Hope that helps.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 10/05/07 17:20</span></i></p>

if you are shifted and die, always always always re-equip your items (or shift and unshift).
