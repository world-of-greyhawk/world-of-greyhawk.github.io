Since I have downloaded the excellent "A hunt through the dark" module, I thought I would make up a character for it.<br><br>This character is based on Phrostbyte's sneaky assassin, found here;<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117673", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Sneak Attack Master</a><br><br>Elf Drow<br>Rogue 9/Shadow Dancer 1/Assassin 26<br>Stats: Str 8 Dex 20 Con 10 Int 16 Wis 8 Cha 8<br><br>***Pasted from Phrostbytes character***<br>rogue skills to max out (save extras for later):<br>appraise<br>disable trap<br>hide<br>move silently<br>open lock<br>pick pocket<br>search<br>set trap<br>tumble<br>use magic device<br><br>shadowdancer skills to max out (save other skill points)<br>hide<br>listen<br>move silently<br>pick pocket<br>set trap<br>tumble<br><br>assassin skills to max out : as rogue but ignoring skills as I list them in the level build.***<br><br>Character below uses Phrostbyte's advancement with my modifications.<br>1 - rogue 1 (dodge, sneak attack +1d6)<br>2 - rogue 2 (evasion)<br>3 - rogue 3 (weapon finesse, uncanny dodge 1, sneak attack +2d6)<br>4 - rogue 4 (stat point : dex)<br>5 - rogue 5 (sneak attack +3d6)<br>6 - rogue 6 (mobility, uncanny dodge 2)<br>7 - rogue 7 (sneak attack +4d6)<br>8 - rogue 8 (stat point : dex)<br>9 - rogue 9 (sneak attack +5d6, ambidexterity)<br>10 - rogue 9 / shadowdancer 1 (hide in plain sight)<br>11 - rogue 10 / shadowdancer 1 (improved evasion)<br>12 - rogue 11 / shadowdancer 1 (stat point : dexterity, two-weapon fighting, sneak attack +6d6, uncanny dodge 3)<br>13 - rogue 12 / shadowdancer 1<br>14 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 (sneak attack +7d6, defensive roll)<br>15 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 1 (improved two-weapon fighting, death attack +1d6, use poison)<br>16 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 2 (stat point : dexterity, poison save 1, ghostly visage)<br>17 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 3 (death attack +2d6)<br>18 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 4 (poison save 2, spring attack)<br>19 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 5 (death attack +3d6, darkness)<br>20 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 6 (stat point : dex, poison save 3)<br>21 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 7 (expertise, death attack +4d6, invisibility)<br>22 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 8 (poison save 4)<br>23 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 9 (death attack +5d6, improved invisibility)<br>24 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 10 (stat point : dexterity, whirlwind attack, poison save 4)<br>25 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 11 (death attack +6d6)<br>26 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 12 (poison save 6+)<br>27 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 13 (death attack +7d6, improved critical)<br>28 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 14 (stat point : dexterity, epic dodge)<br>29 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 15 (death attack +8d6)<br>30 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 16 (great dexterity I )<br>31 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 17 (death attack +9d6)<br>32 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 18 (stat point : dexterity, great dexterity II)<br>33 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 19 (death attack +10d6, self concealment I)<br>34 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 20<br>35 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 21 (death attack +11d6)<br>36 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 22 (stat point : dexterity, self concealment II, self concealment III)<br>37 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 23 (death attack +12d6)<br>38 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 24<br>39 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 25 (death attack +13d6, self concealment IV)<br>40 - rogue 13 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 26 (stat point : dexterity, self concealment V)<br><br>In the above, you could drop improved critical, spring attack, expertise and whirlwind to start taking up your epic feats sooner. You might want to invest in more sneak attack (although your end total will be 20d6, so I don't know if that can be improved on), or up your dexterity with great dex, take armour skin, or get epic dodge and self concealment earlier. I thought it would be fun to have a character who is kind of like the Hollywood style assassins: A ginsu machine in close combat.<br><br>End stats:<br>Str 8 Dex 32 Con 10 Int 16 Wis 8 Cha 8<br>Main weapon: Short Sword (or whatever you prefer to dual weild with)<br>Main-hand AB +32/+27/+22<br>Off-hand AB +32/+27<br><br>Unarmored AC: 29<br>Fort 16 Ref 36 Will 15<br>BAB: 23<br><br>HP's (if rerolled for maximums)<br>13 x 6 (Rogue) = 78<br>1 x 8 (Shadow Dancer = 8<br>26 x 6 (Assassin) = 156<br>Total HP's = 242<br><br>Skills:<br>Disable Trap: 48<br>Hide: 54<br>Listen: 16<br>Lore: 20<br>Move Silently: 54<br>Open Lock: 54<br>Pick Pocket: 28<br>Search: 48<br>Set Trap: 30<br>Tumble: 54<br>UMD: 54<br><br>I find in campaign games and the official campaign that skills like listen and pick pocket are unecessary. I don't know how that will go in the latest one I have downloaded, but I will see. Basically, pick and choose the ones you think are worth it. It's good to allow some skill points to transfer over if you have them spare, so when you change class you can take advantage of whatever you like. I dropped appraise and took lore instead. Again, your own personal preference.<br><br>With this character you will hide and sneak extremely well, be able to identify what you like, open locks and disable pretty much anything, search well to spot traps and hidden doors, pick pockets if you like (or could roll those points into listen or spot as you please), set traps to create battlefield advantages for yourself, tumble like a god, and use pretty much what you like in the way of magic devices.<br><br>Although you don't have many hp's, you do have the bonus of a 20d6 death attack, and many ways in which to run off, hide, and come back to sneak attack again. Use your advantages to gain battlefield supremacy. Oh and having seal concealment V will help a lot, as well as epic dodge which will help mitigate some of the damage you will take.<br><br>Any further ideas or ways to improve this character would be cool! Much kudos to Phrostbyte for giving me the template to use... His version is ultra cool as well.<br><br>Fenriswulf<br><br>Edited By Fenriswulf74 on 03/17/04 00:53:39  <br><br>Edited to fix broken link<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 02:34</span></i></p>
