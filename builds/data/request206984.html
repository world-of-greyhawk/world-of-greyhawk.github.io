Ok, I play on a roleplaying server with a level 30 level cap. What I'm looking for, is a build that can take out groups of enemies (like 4-6 at once) fairly easily, last long without having to rest (16 minute wait time between rests) and has a nice allotment of roleplaying skills. (be it statistics...no min maxing allows...or skills such as persuade).<br><br>Any ideas?<br><br>Oh, and we have subraces too:<br><br>Race: Fav.

Hmm combat cleric, that sounds interesting. I'm sure of my race now, I wanna play a drow (so +2 dex, -2 con, +2 int, +2 cha)...how would I go about this combat cleric thing? Does it happen to have large damage spells too? I was thinking of making a sorc/wiz for high damage spells <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .
