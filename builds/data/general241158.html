My thoughts would be this:<br><br>You'll have access to level 9 spells, but your caster level is so low, the only spells you'll find useful are no-save types (Bigby's, IGMS, etc.) You'll also have almost no chance to beat any kind of moderate SR.<br><br>Your BAB will be quite low, since you need at least 10 levels of WIZ/PM before you qualify for BG, so you may have trouble in melee as well.<br><br>Tough build, but certainly interesting if you can make it survivable.<br>_________________<br>Where I'm playing now: <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk.</a>
