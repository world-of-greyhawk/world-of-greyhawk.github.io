I suppose he means taking 7 levels of paladin first, then 7 levels of COT, then one BG, two COT, three BG and remaining levels COT.

Around lvl 15-20 you would have to do a LOT of alignment changes.  If anyone is wondering why I did that, it was just to get divine shield/divine might, which I couldn't get on a COT level.  It would be possible to squeak a couple extra points of saves out of this build by playing around with stat points, however this build is actually playable and effective in combat.<br>If you are going to try out this build, make sure you can easily change alignment on your server.  Also, it won't protect you from IGMS, or bigbies since they don't have a save.  But it will as far as I know, ALWAYS protect you against any other spells or DEV CRIT etc.  <br><br>When compared to other builds that are immune to crits, like PM builds or Shifter Undead form builds, I think this build has a lot more combat potential.

I still don't know why you chose Blackguard? The Paladin Divine Favor and the Blackguard's do not stack. You'd be better off taking 2 levels of monk for a +3 more to all saves, Evasion, Cleave, and Deflect Arrows. Use the third level on COT or Pally.
