Cheers, Christian, you are just spot on. And I wondered what Power Attack was doing lingering around in that build, thanks for reminding me.  Substitute that for LoH is perfect, this build's saves are actually pretty sick.  In a good way, I mean.<br><br>Good hunting.

I tweaked this build after getting ready to build it on my PW.  It is slightly better this way (+1 to fortitude save at the cost of . . . nothing really).

Your CHA is somewhat low if you're planning to use Divine Might/Shield, 14 is low, even bufed to max into 26 gives a +7, which is almost the minimum for it, considering you also get Divine Wrath with +5 power, I would suggest you to change some STR for CHA.<br><br>More CHA also gives more saves.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;this build's saves are actually pretty sick.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "132030", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Check this guy.</a><br><br>EDIT: Saves are never high enough IMO, in my most recent build I make Stunning Fist with DC around 60 buffed, and you would surely be angry if you get hit by a Devastating Critical from those max STR builds or something like that.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 05/03/06 02:35</span></i></p>
