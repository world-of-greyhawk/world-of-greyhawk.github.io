I built this character after I played the Darkwall Defender a bit and realized I wanted more buffing spells. While this character has lower HP he has the potential to gain more via buffs.  The same goes for Strength.  Unfortunately, he does not have knockdown or improved critical.<br><br>Darkwall Battlepriest<br>Cleric 10/Blackguard 4/Dwarven Defender 26<br><br><b>Playable PvM Levels 1-40</b><br><br>Domains: War and Strength<br><br>Race  Dwarf<br>Alignment  LE<br><br><b>Abilitie scores</b><br><br>Str 14 (16)<br>Dex 13<br>Con 10<br>Int 14<br>Wis 13 (15)<br>Cha 13 (26)<br><br><br><b>Leveling</b><br><br>1  Cleric 1: Power Attack <br>2  Cleric 2<br>3  Cleric 3: Toughness<br>4  Cleric 4: WIS=14<br>5  Cleric 5<br>6  Cleric 6: Cleave<br>7  Cleric 7<br>8  Cleric 8: CHA=14<br>9  BG 1: Dodge <br>10 DwD 1<br>11 DwD 2<br>12 BG 2: Divine Might, CHA=15<br>13 DwD 3<br>14 DwD 4<br>15 BG 3: Divine Shield<br>16 DwD 5: CHA=16<br>17 DwD 6<br>18 DwD 7: Weapon Focus (Warhammer)<br>19 DwD 8<br>20 DwD 9: WIS=15<br>21 DwD 10: Great Cha I (CHA=17)<br>22 Cleric 9 *<br>23 DwD 11<br>24 DwD 12: Great Cha II (CHA=18), CHA=19<br>25 DwD 13<br>26 DwD 14: EWF (Warhammer)<br>27 DwD 15: Great Cha III (CHA=20)<br>28 DwD 16: CHA=21<br>29 DwD 17<br>30 DwD 18: Great Cha IV (CHA=22), Epic Prowess<br>31 DwD 19<br>32 DwD 20: CHA=23<br>33 DwD 21: Great Cha V (CHA=24)<br>34 DwD 22: Armor Skin<br>35 DwD 23<br>36 DwD 24: Great Cha VI (CHA=25), CHA=26<br>37 DwD 25<br>38 DwD 26: Energy Resistance: Fire I<br>39 Cleric 10: Great Str I (STR=15) %<br>40 BG 4: STR=16 #<br><br>* - Placed to get 25 ranks in spellcraft and level 5 spells.<br>% - Placed to get 40 ranks in spellcraft<br># - Placed to max out Taunt<br><br>Turn Undead 11x/day (13x/day with Eagle's Splendor +4 CHA)<br><br><b>Buffing Abilities</b><br>Blackguard Bull's Strength 1x/Day (stacks with Cleric spell) <br>Defensive Stance 13x/day (+2 STR, +4 CON, +4 Dodge AC) <br>Divine Might (+7 Divine Damage, +9 with Eagle's Splendor +4 CHA)<br>Divine Shield (+7 AC, +9 with Eagle's Splendor +4 CHA)<br><br><b>Domain Powers (duration 5 + Charisma Modifier)</b><br>War Domain Ability 1x/day (+3 Dex, +3 Con, +3 AB, +3 Magical Dmg for 13-15 rounds)<br>Strength Domain Ability 1x/day (+5 Strength for 13-15 rounds, stacking)<br><br><b>Important Spells</b><br>1 Aid, Divine Favor, Prot v Alignment, Bless<br>2 Bull's Strength, Endurance, Eagle's Splendor<br>3 Prot v Elements, Magic Vestment, Darkfire, Divine Power (Domain), Prayer<br>4 Greater Magic Weapon, Divine Power<br>5 Battletide<br><br>With multiple strength boosting abilities and spells, this character should rarely have less than the maximum buff of +12 to strength.

What he really doesn't gets compared to the Darkwall Defender is EWS...... which takes me to, you would get much more melee power with Fighter rather than Blackguard, cleric gets the turn undead required for Divine Might/ Divine Shield, which is one of the mains of Blackguard on the Darkwall Defender, so in that aspect, blackguard wouldn't be needed here, except... it might not be a "Darkwall" without the Blackguard.<br><br>Fighter would also give you extra feats, bad thing about it is you would lose saves big time from CHA boost blackguard gives, and again tumble instead of taunt.<br><br>Cleric..... cleric buffs max power at level 15, (for +5 on divine favor and greater magical weapon, and +10 on darkfire, which makes you a killer on low magical servers), and that only if I didn't missed something, or something else gets at max at some other level, but you would lose significant DR for them, I think it's ok, since even taking blackgoard out completely, your DR would still lower by 6.<br><br>It's also a very good build, although several of your buffs last for a very short time.

Quick question:<br>If he has the cleric damage buffs (darkfire/divine favor) does he really need EWS? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">

Nothing is ever <b>needed</b>, I just say, +6 damage from EWS and the respective feats is more than what Blackguard gives to melee.

I think the defensive power in saves that Dark Blessing gives is a rather powerful aspect of this character as well.  Not to mention the stacking bull's strength, which was a sort of secondary inspiration for this build.
