I would welcome sugestions to my idea.<br>The idea is to have two weapons being, kama and be able to do the most number of attacks per turn.<br>To accomplish this, the best would be to get the full BAB of 20 given by the fighter with the monk numbers of attacks. So the goal is something like +19/+16/+13/+10/+7/+4/+1 on the primary hand.<br>Also look into the highest AC possible, we will then have high Dextry and Wisdow.<br><br>Although the requirements for WM are quite hard to get I belive it can make the Kama a pretty nice weapon.<br><br>Fighter Feats needed:<br>Two-Weapon <br>Ambidextry (req. Dex 15)<br>Weapon Finesse (Kama)<br>Imp. Critical(req. bab +8)<br>Improved 2 Weapons (req. 2 weapon) <br>*Cleave (req. power attack)  *not sure<br>Thoughness <br><br>WM  requirements:<br>Dexterity 13+, Intelligence 13+<br>BA +5 <br>Dodge <br>Weapon Focus Meele<br>Mobility <br>Expertise <br>Spring Attack<br>Whirlwind attack<br>Intimidate skill: 4 ranks (8 skill points)<br><br><br>WM Benefits:<br>Increased Multiplier (WM level 5)  Critical x1 more<br>Superior Weapon Focus (WM level 5) +1 to Weapon every 5 lvls<br>Ki Critical (WM level 7)  +2 on Critical Modifier<br><br>so far 12 feats, any ideas?<br><br>I want to avoid the 20% penalty so I am looking for a Dwarf Fighter(25)Monk(8)WM(7)<br><br>any thought welcome...

And you don't need to be dwarf to avoid an experience penalty (human would do just fine if you prefer), nor do you need to keep your monk and weapon master levels within one of each other.  Prestige classes do not count at all when considering multiclassing penalties, and humans (and half-elves for that matter) never have XP penalties with only two base (i.e. non-prestige) classes, since they automatically ignore the higher base class when determining any penalties.  It looks like you specified your race and level requirements based on those misconceptions, so let us know if you still specifically want that race and those levels now that you know it's not necessary.  I for one would take more epic monk levels to pick up more monk speed, AC, and feats (it won't hurt your AB at all, since epic characters gain +1 AB every 2 levels regardless of class).<br><br>Steve

Post your build idea (level layout) and the type PW (how high of magic) or if you're just doing this for the single-player campaign.  I'm sure many are willing to point out improvements or ideas.

I would suggest starting stats of these:<br>14 STR<br>16 DEX<br>16 CON<br>14 INT<br>10 WIS<br>6 CHA<br>Put all your points into DEX. You don't really need 24 levels of fighter, if you change some fighter levels to WM, you can get more AB plus a lot of those fighter feats aren't that useful. I would go something like 13 Monk/8 Fighter/19 WM. 4 Monk/6 Fighter/10 WM pre-epic to maximize AB. Use the WM epic feats for Weapon focus, Prowess, and Armor Skin and the Fighter feat for epic weapon specialization. Use all but one general epic feat for Great DEX.

Here's a pretty good and quickly maturing Monk multiclass build. You do end up taking full advantage of the mega number of attacks monks get. I didn't post any starting stats as that can be left to you and depends on if you want to go strength monk or dex monk. I kind of go middle of the road myself for flexibility. Anyway here's the build template I've used. I've only taken it to level twenty. If any of the Great builders on here have any pointers or suggestions for epic levels and feats please post them.<br><br>1 Monk 1 (Expertise, Dodge) [Evasion, Flurry of Blows, Improved Unarmed Strike, Monk AC Bonus, Stunning Fist, Cleave] +0<br>2 Fighter 1 (Bonus - Weapon Focus: Kama) +1<br>3 Monk 2 (Mobility) [Deflect Arrows] +2<br>4 Fighter 2 (Bonus - Spring Attack) +3<br>5 Monk 3 [Monk Speed, Still Mind] +4/+1<br>6 Fighter 3 (Whirlwind Attack) +5/+2<br>7 Fighter 4 (Bonus - Weapon Specialization: Kama) +6/+3<br>8 Weap Master 1 [Ki Damage, Weapon of Choice: Kama] +7/+4/+1<br>9 Monk 4 (Improved Critical: Kama) +8/+5/+2<br>10 Weap Master 2 +9/+6/+3<br>11 Weap Master 3 +10/+7/+4/+1<br>12 Weap Master 4 (Ambidexterity) +11/+8/+5/+2<br>13 Weap Master 5 [Increased Multiplier, Superior Weapon Focus] +12/+9/+6/+3<br>14 Monk 5 [Purity of Body] +12/+9/+6/+3<br>15 Monk 6 (Two Weapon Fighting) [Knockdown, Improved Knockdown] +13/+10/+7/+4/+1<br>16 Monk 7 [Wholeness of Body] +14/+11/+8/+5/+2<br>17 Monk 8 +15/+12/+9/+6/+3<br>18 Monk 9 (Improved Two-Weapon Fighting) [Improved Evasion] +15/+12/+9/+6/+3<br>19 Weap Ma 6 +16/+13/+10/+7/+4/+1<br>20 Weap Ma 7 [Ki Critical] +17/+14/+11/+8/+5/+2<br><br>I hope you like the build!!

I'm working on a monk/fighter/wm too. I want monk to be the primary class.<br><br>My current build is a dual-wielding finesse 20 monk/4 fighter (4th level at epic to pick up weapon spec + epic weapon spec)/16 wm (2 x epic superior weapon focus). 7 or 8 levels of monk pre epic to minimize BAB loss.<br><br>Non epic feats include dual wielding feats, toughness, improved crit, wm prereqs. Epic feats include epic prowess, armor skin, great dexterity.<br><br>Cons compared to a level 40 monk: lower AC and SR, slower movement speed, less skill points<br>Pros: more HP, higher BAB, 1 more attack per round, more damage due to epic weapon spec, more class skills<br><br>Cons vs. more fighter/wm levels: less feats, lower bab<br>Pros: Higher AC, better movement speed, better SR<br><br>Anyone have feedback/suggestions for this build?

I was trying out a similar build (monk 23, fighter 10, WM 7) but focusing on unarmed attacks. I found that I could not make the build due to the WM prestige class not showing when I got all the prerequisites. Is this due to the weapon focus in unarmed strikes?

actualy I think that WM should be compatable with Improved Unarmed using characters, in D&amp;D (the basze for NWN:) as soon as you have Improved Unarmed you are considered Armed when striking with your fist/food/elbow/knee/head or whatever body part you fancy for attacking...<br><br>If you can take Focus and specilization you should be ableto be a WM with the weapon, that WMs are disallowed for this is just silly, or a bug.
