I'd like suggestions for a monk build for a roleplay-enforced pvp server.  I've tried making a few pure monk builds on a character build module, but I'd really like some suggestions from people who actually know how to build characters.<br><br>Some notes on the server restrictions:<br>-Max level is 30<br>-Must always have three consecutive levels in a class.  Also can't take 29 levels of one class and 1 of a second.<br>-Shifter and Red Dragon Disciple are unavailable (to me).<br>-Server generally favors mages, and Acid Sheath is unnerfed.  Melee characters are still common and useful.<br>-Hellball and Greater Ruin have been seriously beefed up.<br><br>Basic character concept:<br>-LN monk of Kelemvor, which means the monk's mission is primarily to be an undead hunter.<br>-Human preferred.  Elves are chaotic here.  The human subraces are all planetouched (and currently unavailable to me), so ordinary humans don't have natural differences.<br><br>Other things:<br>-I'd like to avoid min-maxing attributes.<br>-Preferably only monk levels (see the restrictions on multiclassing).

Even so, PvP has rules which require role play for it to occur and I don't forsee a need to have to fight other players all the time (none of my other characters needed to, other than the drow).

I was thinking along whiz' line of thought.  I was contemplating 10 rdd, but that means you need 4 sorc which is now only 16 monk...  it doesnt make sense to do it that way, so ftr/monk is the way.

The problem with that is that Improved Ki Strike 4 needs 21 wisdom and is an epic feat.  Most characters are between 10 and 20 and Stoneskin is available quite early for a wizard.  It's not impossible to break through the Stoneskin spells, but if the mage also has Acid Sheath going, then that means ranged combat.  If I make a strength monk it will probably be difficult to get monk feats with wisdom requirements.<br><br>I did forget to mention that there are ways to add non-physical damage to weapons, but 6 points is the most, they don't stack, and they are very expensive if they are permanent.  Monk gloves and armor that were standard in NWN don't seem to exist in this module as far as I can tell, though.
