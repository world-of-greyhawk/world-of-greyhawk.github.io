Besides Necromancy, which spell focus would you carry through to epic spellfocus?  Or none at all?

First and foremost Necromancy, but other than that?<br><br>Maybe Evocation - there's more to this school than Bigby's and Isaac's<br><br>Maybe Illusion just for weird, if you're a gnome or illusionist :invisible smiley graphic:<br><br>Or maybe Enchantment, if you're a mindbender <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

While I don't often play spellcasters, I've thought Enchantment could be useful - I've seen mages on PW's cast Dominate Monster (or something like that) on nasty boss monsters and then go wreak havoc.<br><br>I'm pretty certain that the spell is Enchantment School.<br><br>Can anyone speak to this practice or this spell?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br>Check out the Epic Character Builders Guild<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Test your new builds in this mod:<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/modules/data/1073117317280.shtml" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

Yes, that spell is from Enchantment.<br>This school of magic is especially powerful at lower levels, when enemies have ridiculously low saving throws. But a skilled enchanter is good even at level 40 - most players have items, spells or abilities that grant them protection from instant death or death magic, but only a few have protection from mind effects.

Abjuration is also a very good spell school and spell focus to have! If you have a server where you need to use Mords alot, then definately take abjuration. it really improves the spell. Sometimes on PVP servers Mords are essential for winning! <br>Just my opinion <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

Since there is no saves (the focus feat only affects spell Save DC, iirc), I would assume only the casting level of the spell being stripped, a DC (of 11 iirc), and a dice roll would be the deciding factor in stripping the spells?
