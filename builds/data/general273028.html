Hey all,<br><br>I am messing around with a wiz/sorc build and have a few questions regarding a 20/20 wiz sorcerer:<br>-Do the levels of W and S stack as far as SR checks?<br>-Do you get 2 familiars, or 1 and what lvl are they?<br>-What spell schools would be best for this build?<br><br>Thanks in advance!<br><br>B.<br>_________________<br>Everything`s been done, everything`s been said so why bother

I made a Wizard 20 / Sorcerer 20 build a while ago, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "261644", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>click here</a> if you want to look at it. As Mick Dagger said, SR is a terrible weakness, you should probably take Spell Penetration feats (as I forgot them on my build) because there's nothing else you can do to attempt breaching SR (and well, cast Mords, but it isn't that much). It's a fun and strong build, you can spam Time Stop <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  <br><br>As far as I recall Familiar level stacked perfectly (haven't checked on the latest version, but you just tested it does), contrary to a Ranger/Druid Animal Companion which I think doesn't stacks.<br><br>Best school is a matter of taste, but Necromancy is what I commonly take, instant death spells is what requires a high DC to end a battle immediately, damage spells hit anyway, just use IGMS.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 05/06/07 18:02</span></i></p>
