.. with my char building.<br><br>I was playing around with a Fighter/Rogue/SD pre epic (maybe a mistake in the first place) and whenever I take 4 (or even 5) levels of Fighter, I still don't get my BAB high enough for 4 attacks/round.<br><br>Is it that SD level that's messing me up pre-epic?  Only way I've done it so far is to take 7 fighter levels pre-epic.  <br><br>I'm trying to get away with as few as possible in order to maximize my Rogue abilities (sneak attack, possibly self concealment, etc.)<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Joe C.

Your rogue and SD levels will need to be in multiples of 4.  For example, having a 8/8/4 Rogue/SD/Fighter will work, as will a 12/4/4 Rogue/SD/Fighter.  If you take 1 level of SD, you'll need to make up for it with a lot of fighter (7 minimum, as you found).<br>_________________<br>"Intelligence is knowing a tomato is a fruit; Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad."

To calculate your BAB, look at the table "Base Saves and Attacks for all classes" in your hotu manual.<br><br>Add up the first AB rating for each class. Eg: If you have a 6Ftr/8Rogue/6SD, your BAB would be<br><br> 6(from Ftr) + 6 (from Rogue) + 4 (from SD) = 16.<br><br>To get 4 attacks per sound, your pre-epic BAB has to be 16.
