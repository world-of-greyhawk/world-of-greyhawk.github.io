A mage build I've been toying about with for some time. I think I've finally got it where I want it, so here he is. Dwarf is taken for the CON boost, with the hit to CHA not being a real issue in most cases. The idea is to have a caster that can wear armor and get a decent AC without having to worry about spell failure. I chose to specialize for the extra spell per day. Sacrificing Enchantment spells is something I'm more than willing to do, since mind-spell immunity seems to be the most common form of magic protection available in most environments. I chose to focus in Evocation and Necromancy for this guy, but it's easy enough to choose something different, or even drop the Focus feats in one or both schools and replace them with something else if you like. I plan on trying this guy out in a 'themed campaign', taking him through several modules, which will hopefully take him from level one to at least late epic levels. <br><br>There are, of course, a number of builds with a lot of WIZ levels, and some are somewhat similar, but nothing exactly like this.

Depending on your feat choices (see below), Craft Weapon would be a good candidate for some of them. Search and Open Lock (at least 1 point) are also skills to consider and maybe even Set Trap for some fun and games.<br><br>*Combat Casting and Improved Combat Casting are offered as possibilites. If you're not a big fan of them, then I'd suggest going with Craft Wand in place of CC and possibly an Epic Spell Focus in place of ICC. Another possibility is the Expertise/Improved Expertise line, if you don't mind that exploit and it's enabled where you play.<br><br>**Depending on your environment (i.e. high magic), EMA may not be optimal.

He gets tons of spells, can learn any from scrolls (except the prohibited school), and has the ability to get a decent AC going at need (in mundane gear and without using EMA, he can get his AC to 45. With EMS as well, it jumps to 55. If you use Imp Expertise, you'll get it to 65). Sacrifing 2 caster levels was worth the +4 boost to AC, I think.<br><br>Yeah, I know Rogue (or Bard) would give you Tumble for 4 more AC and UMD. However, you'd have to take Rogue (or Bard) at level 40 in order to avoid an XP penalty, which would mean no benefit until the end of your career. As well, you've no pressing need of UMD as an armored mage, since most Monk gear is usually best used without using armor and shield, and the divine items aren't generally going to be missed by an arcane caster.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 01/23/07 22:07</span></i></p>

Hmm, a single PM level in the very beginning is not a bad idea, +2 AC with no XP penalty, nice.<br><br>Any special reason to start with 14 STR? if you raise your final INT to 36 (starting STR 8 / INT 18 makes it) you'll get a bonus level 5 and 9 slots.

This is a 1-40 build, and carrying full plate/tower shield with 8 str kinda sucks...I'd guess that's the point of the str boost.

I can't stand having 8 STR in my caster builds. I like to at least be able to carry something, and I also find the first few levels pretty much require you to do a bit of melee (i.e. you generally end up playing the melee mage type of caster). Strength helps with that (remember, you don't get Bull's until 3rd level at the earliest). For the addition of only +2 INT and +1 on DCs, I don't like the trade-off.<br><br>*edit* You could go with 10 STR and 10 DEX to start with 18 INT, but it's still a bit low for my tastes. However, I'd find that much more palatable. Good point on the extra spells you get with the higher final INT though.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 01/23/07 23:19</span></i></p>
