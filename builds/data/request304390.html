This is for a low-magic server, but if I find it "fun" enough, it could potentially be used elsewhere.  <br><br>I'm thinking cleric; though I considered druid (and haven't ruled it out 100%).  Animal and Strength domains seem the best, since I'm limited to deity-specific domains (My other option would be Evil).  Malar is chaotic, so no monk splashes.  <br><br>Other than that, I'm entirely open to suggestions.  Malar is strongly against (forbids) killing from a distance, so this is going to be a strongly melee oriented character.  Getting a character with the proper "feel" is more important in this case than having the "strongest" build, not that I have anything against a concept that achieves both.  Of course, I doubt that a cleric on a low-magic server is ever going to be in danger of being "weak".      <br><br>Thanks.  <br><br><br>I'll post Malar's Dogma as an optional read.  Many of you likely are familiar with him anyway.  <br><br>DOGMA<br>Survival of the fittest and the winnowing of the weak are Malar's Legacy. A brutal, bloody death or kill has great meaning. The crux of life is the challenge between the hunter and the prey, the determination of who lives or dies. View every important task as a hunt. Remain ever alert and alive. Walk the wilderness without trepidation, and show no fear in the hunt. Savagery and strong emotions defeat reason and careful thought in all things. Taste the blood of those you slay, and never kill from a distance. Work against those who cut back the forest and who kill beasts solely because they are dangerous Slay not the young, the pregnant, or deepspawn so that prey will remain plentiful.

Despite the bar on monk levels, for flavor you still may want to go unarmed. To that end take assassin levels so you can still use monk only gloves with the help of a healthy UMD score. You will want 4 attacks and a good damage output, so four levels of fighter pre epic and one post epic for regular and epic specialization would do some good toward that "bloody" death your looking for. <br><br>Druid really would be a good way to go because you could play him as a lycanthrope with wildshape pretty early. Malar loves his evil shapeshifters.

This idea SCREAMS for a cleric/bg/rogue type of human.<br><br>GO for a wis 19/ str 26 would be great to get dev crit (eVIL).<br><br>Use rog for skill dumps, pos just 2 or 3.  I like cleric25rog2/bg13.  Take first 20 lvls as cleric (which is power in and of itself).  Take power att/ cleave to qual for bg.  Take rog for Hide 5, in epic and 13 bg with rog near 37 to max tumble and umd at 40.<br><br>This is a TOUGH char concept.  If you cant use dev crit, you need cleave anyway.  BUT NOT GR CLeave!  Just pump up str in epic, taking ewf, epic prowess for sure.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Favored Weapon is a claw bracer. That's a bit difficult to place in NWN's weapon choices. But it's more of a slashing/talon style weapon than true monk gloves, IMHO. Daggers might work, or kukri perhaps? Something slashing or piercing and yet "up close."<br><br>I agree that cleric/rogue/blackguard would be perfect for this concept. Evil and Strength for domains. Given the blackguard, remember to keep your charisma positive so the Dark Blessing doesn't penalize your saves.

Thanks for the suggestions so far. <br>Playing a druid for the animals shapes was why I considered it.  <br><br>I'm definitely on board with the dagger or kukri suggestion.   <br>As far as I know, Dev Crit is allowed.  Who knows if I'll ever get that far, but that's not really the point.  I'll include it in the planning.  <br><br>Any other "must have" features?  <br>I'm going to play around with it shortly, so any further ideas would be greatly appreciated.
