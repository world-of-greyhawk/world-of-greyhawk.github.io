With all of these Zen/Arcane Archers running rampant. I thought I would release to the public this build.. The ideas just keep on coming folks.<br><br>In the year of our Lord Torm 1203.<br><br>Lord Skarvig, peered out of his mountain top kingdom only to fall upon the eyes of dispair. He could see that the wood elves had advanced in the night. His numbers were dropping quickly. His Dwarf Guard could do nothing against the quickly growing threat of the Arcane Archers. They would move quickly in to position to strike and within a blink they had fired and retreated into safety...<br><br>Lord Skarvig was left but one choice. He knew his Guard could not continue chasing Elves into the night. They were too slow to catch and if left behind, quick to die. Lord Skarvig had sent dispatchers to his brother Balin 2 days past. There had been no word. For what most did not know or expect were Balins Elite. Trained for the purpose of handling the Arcane Archers. Rumors of them having skin so tough that no arrow could hurt them. <br><br>Skarvig continued to watch as more of him dwarves fell. Then...when all hope had felt lost. He heard the horns in bellowing in the distance. YESS!!! He yelled out. The Dwarven Retaliaton had arrived. They moved quicker than most dwarves and carried a Dwarven Crossbow. The elves could do nothing to peirce them, and upon retreating they recieved a taste of their own medicine. Bolts to the back...Lord Skarvig did not have to watch for long...<br><br><br>The idea behind this build is to have a ranged presence that moves forward towards danger firing. Rather than running away firing. The Dwarven Retaliator shrugs off damage given to it, and is quite skilled at dealing it.<br><br>Dwarven Retaliation <br><br>Advantages <br>700hp<br>5-7 Possible Attacks Hasted<br>Wears Full Plate<br>24/- Points of Permanent Damage Reduction  <br>Level 6 Cleric Spells<br><br>Disadvantages <br>Could use more damage output. <br><br>Attack Sequence<br>40/35/30/25<br>1-10 +7(Critical 17-19/x2)<br><br>After casting all the cleric buffs I had it ended up<br>49/44/39/34/Haste Attack/Divine Power Attack<br>1-10 +7+4+2+1(Critical 17-19/x2)<br><br>Im not very fond of spells so I didnt try to min/max any of them.<br><br>Starting/Ending Stats<br>STR 8/8<br>DEX 12/13<br>CON 18/22<br>INT 8/8<br>WIS 18/28<br>CHA 6/6<br><br>Stat Progression<br>Dex, Con, Con, Con, Con, Wis, Wis, Wis, Wis, Wis<br><br>LvL/Feat Progression<br>1CLR-Luck of Heros*<br>2CLR<br>3CLR-Toughness<br>4CLR<br>5CLR<br>6FTR-Dodge, Zen Archery<br>7FTR-Point Blank Shot<br>8FTR-Rapid Reload<br>9FTR-Weapon Focus (Heavy Crossbow), Weapon Specialization (Heavy Crossbow)<br>10DWD<br>11DWD<br>12DWD-Empower Spell<br>13DWD<br>14DWD<br>15DWD-Improved Critical (Heavy Crossbow)<br>16DWD<br>17DWD<br>18DWD-Extend Spell<br>19DWD<br>20FTR<br>21FTR-Epic Weapon Focus, Epic Weapon Specialization<br>22DWD<br>23DWD<br>24DWD-Epic Prowness<br>25DWD-Epic Damage Reduction I<br>26DWD<br>27DWD-Great Wisdom I<br>28DWD<br>29DWD-Epic Damage Reduction II<br>30DWD-Great Wisdom II<br>31DWD<br>32DWD<br>33DWD-Great Wisdom III, Epic Damage Reduction III<br>34CLR<br>35CLR<br>36CLR-Great Wisdom IV<br>37CLR<br>38CLR<br>39CLR-Great Wisdom V<br>40CLR-<br><br>Equipment <br>Heavy Crossbow<br>Full Plate
