ok ive been testing a few things out and im not sure if dex or str is better, also would half orc best suite a build like this or human due to the extra feat so that i can focus and get Ambdexterity and TWF? also is it possible to get dev crit on dual wielders?? also for feats lots of disc/tum/and spot would be fine and maybe throw is a few bard levels for some boosting?

First off 30 lvls of WM is totally and utterly useless. The ab on a WM increases ever 3 lvls after lvl 10 so: 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31 since you can only take 30 lvls of Wm your reletive usful maximmum is 28.<br><br>Also if you are playing PVP there are very few builds that are any good with TWF, That is Monks weilding Kamas, anyone with monk wis ac since sheild negates it, and CSers (Corner sneakers) Otherwise your classic tank is best off with a shield for the extra AC or a big weapon for the extra Damage.<br><br>As for a Str Build go: <br><br>10 Fighter/28 Wm/2 rogue<br><br>Depending on the Weapons on the server you play with you want to take either Rapier or Scimitar depending on which one is better for the 10-20 crit range on a keen one. Or alternitively go Dwarven Waraxe for More damage if there are a lot of crit-immune people.<br><br>With this your looking at around 62 or so ab with a +5 wep and +12 str<br><br>As for a Dex build with so many WM lvls you either Dump epic Dodge/Uncanny Dodge and go for killer ab, or loose ab get uncanny and Epic Dodge. I'll show both:<br><br>Fighter 10/WM 25/HS 5<br><br>Go HS for the two bonus feats and take both of them great dexterity, go Elf start with 20 dex, and with +12 dex you end with 50 dex. The +1 ab you loose from 25 WM lvls over 28 is negated by the +2 dex, also you get +1 ac, tumble, spot, disc etc and beter saves.<br><br>You're looking at about 66 ab with +12 dex and +5 weapon<br><br>For Epic Dodge/Tumble go<br><br>13 Rogue/19 Wm/8 Fighter<br><br>Your ab will be 62-64 ab with +12 dex and +5 weapon, but on the other hand you go gain 7d6 sneak attacks, epic dodge, and uncanny dodge. Also you are 1 ac less then the aforementioned HS build.<br><br>Hope that helps.<br>_________________<br>~I am the wisest man on earth because I know one thing, and that is I know nothing.~<br>-Cairne

goot point Cinn, though with Halflign you get -4 disc to KD from Size, so on a PvP Server with high ab, or Disc saves on Bigbies (liek BoW) you'll ned 78 disc as a halfling, so you'd need SF: Disc, and ESF: Disc and nice items too for that as a halfling. Also another bonus for elf is alwasy in detect mode so you can help vs those CS builds who'll try adn sneak up on you, so you can turn around and avoid getting caught flatfooted. Also 5 lvls of HS allow for Better saves Invis as a Spell, also Craft harper item, and on BoW that gives +1 ac and +1 ab. but it's really a matter of preference and server.<br>_________________<br>~I am the wisest man on earth because I know one thing, and that is I know nothing.~<br>-Cairne

1 Rogue<br>2-7 ftr<br>8-17 wm<br>18-20 rogue<br>then epic it's pretty much up to you, if you go weapon spec pre epic then take the 2nd fighter feat after you take Epic Weapon Focus so you can take epic weapon spec. If you go rogue first you'll get epic dodge quicker but lack feats early on liek armour skin epic prowess etc. If you go WM you'll get Epic dodge later but get more feats earlier. If you split it up it;s more playable but you still get Epic dodge pretty late.<br><br>Make sure to take a WM lvls 2nd to last and a rogue lvl last. tae 40 tumble 43 disc at least.<br><br>Pre-epic Feats:<br>Neecesary:<br>(take first)reqs for WM<br>Wepaon Focus<br>expertise<br>Dodge<br>Mobility<br>spring attack<br>Whirlwind Attack<br><br>Other pre-epic feats:<br>Weapon Finess<br>Blind Fight<br>Improved Crit<br>SF: Disc<br>KD<br><br>If you can fit it in <br>Weapon Spec<br><br>Epic Feats:<br>Great Dex I-VI<br>Epic Skill Focus: Disc though you might have to sub it in for Epic dodge... not sure.<br><br>Rogue Feats:<br>Improved Evasion<br>Defensive Roll<br><br>Wm Feats:<br>Epic Prowess<br>Epic Weapon focus<br>Armour Skin<br><br>Not entirely sure how this build would play out on BoW but you might want to test it in the tent and see if you like it.<br>_________________<br>~I am the wisest man on earth because I know one thing, and that is I know nothing.~<br>-Cairne
