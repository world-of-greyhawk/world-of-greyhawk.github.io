<b>Playable from 1-40, PvM, PvP</b><br><br><b>Deathless Pariah</b><br><br>It started as a love story.  He was the King of Questilar's Captain, and he was in love with his liege's daughter.  But there was another who loved her.  The King's Counselor and wizard, the Mage Maximus.  In secret he revealed his love to her, but she spurned him, and said that she loved another.  A bitterness festered in his black heart, and it fueled the murderous rage that burned within him.  But he was patient.  And he was methodical.  Maximus concealed his feelings, and watched with envious eyes the Captain and the Princesss from afar.  And so the Mage plotted.  He plotted not only their demise, but a way to overthrow the King and take control of the Kingdom.  And so he befriended the Captain, and treated him as his brother, and they broke bread together, and spoke long into the night of life and philosophies.  The Captain became a pupil of sorts, and the Mage taught him cantrips at first, revealing just a little at a time, slowly gaining more and more trust.  In the meantime, the bond between the Captain and the Princess grew, and her Father the King approved of their love, and they were to be Wed on Midsummer's Eve.<br><br>At this time, a great evil arose in Dreadwood to the East, a Necromancer fell and rotten, who sent minions neither living nor dead to raid the human settlements, and bring back to his lair the bounty of living flesh.  The attacks grew worse, until a great horde of deathless warriors laid waste to the Eastern Kingdom.  And so it came to be that on Midsummer's Eve, on the day of the great Wedding, the King was forced to send his Captain and a large force of men to meet this evil, and rid the kingdom of this menace.  The Captain met the undead foes upon the field of battle and utterly defeated them.  But he was deceived, for while he battled this force, the Mage Maximus revealed his deception to the King.  He had prepared a secret force of Undead beneath the Castle, and they slew the King, his attendants and all who remained within.  Maximus seized the princess, and through the dark arts of sorcery, sucked just enough life force from her body to keep her all but dead.<br><br>The Captain returned with his remaining force to the Castle, only to discover death everywhere.  He rushed headlong into the halls to find Maximus weeping over the dead King and Princess.  "I tried, my Captain, but they were too many!  I have failed us all!"  The Captain pressed his cheek to the Princess's mouth, and felt a slight breath upon his skin.<br>"She lives still, Maximus!  We must save her!"<br>"I'm sorry, milord, but there is nothing we can do.  She was touched by the Necromancer!"<br>"Do something, Maximus!  Anything!  This was to be our wedding day!  Whatever it takes, bring her back, I beg you."<br>There was a silence, and Maximus appeared thoughful.<br>"There is something....but--"<br>"I don't care what it is, just do it.  Now, I beseech you!"<br><br>And so Maximus' plan was nearly fulfilled.  A plan that had been years in the making.  To exact revenge on an unrequited love, to seize a Kingdom, bring low the King's champion, and to achieve Lichdom all in one fell moment.  He pulled forth a black and vile phylactery.  He bid that he grab the Lady's hand in his own, and that they both grab the Phial while he prepared the spell.  <br><br>The Captain didn't notice the unlooked-for storm that suddenly burst outside the Castle.  He didn't notice that he and the princess lay in the middle of faintly drawn circles and magical inscriptions, or the smouldering braziers that stood at pentegonal corners.   He didn't notice the dark angry energies that swirled around them, nor the harsh incantations uttered by Maximus, nor his suddenly gaunt and stretched skin upon his face.  All his focus was upon his love, his life, and in that instant she gasped and looked upon him with recognition, and barely breathed the word, "Trap."  And then the light in her eyes went out.<br><br>He felt his own skin begin to tighten, harden, and he looked up to see not Maximus speaking the incantations, but some creature of bone and rotting flesh, and he knew that it had all been a deception.  With his remaining strength he launched the phylactery against the stone walls where it exploded in a bright flash.  <br>"No! What are you doing!" the Mage screamed.  "You've ruined it, you've ruined everything!"<br>"You are the Necromancer!  You Maximus!"<br>With eyes ablaze he rushed Maximus and knocked him to the floor where he lay stunned.  He stood above him with blade in hand.<br>"You fool!  I have still won.  The princess is dead, and you....you, my dear friend, are dead as well.  You are half-alive and half dead, with one foot in each of those realms, and you will never feel love again, nor the tender caress of a woman.  For who could love an abomination such as yourself? In destroying bottle you have destroyed me, but you have cursed yourself!"<br><br>And the Captain looked at the arm that gripped his sword and saw the flesh melt away until it was naught but bone.  <br>And Maximus laughed.<br><br>"You fool.  It was I who loved her.  I!  Who are you but some simple farmboy who could swing a sword?  It was I, I, who could've showed her things she could only imagine, and you stole her!  You may slay me, but I still win this day.  This day, I take your King, your love, your world, and your soul!"<br><br>"You are the Master of the Dead," the Captain breathed, "and if I am as you say, then by the Dead shall you be mastered!"<br><br>And Maximus's laughter echoed throughout the burning halls, and the Captain removed his body from his head, and burned him with the castle, and all the undead who were within.  When the remaining forces of Questilar looked upon his visage, and saw him holding the dead King's daughter, they revolted from him, and thought him the Necromancer.  And they came at him with swords and spears, but he did not stop them.  He welcomed the bite of their blades.  But, cursed as he was, no blade could penetrate his flesh.  Even though he bade them "Kill me," they could not.  But fearing they would try to take the body of his beloved, he fled into the hill country.  And he took his love to a hidden valley where he prayed for her, and set her body alight upon a pyre that burned long into the night.  <br><br>And he left behind him the Kingdom of Questilar, and wandered the lonely paths of the world, forever hearing the words of Maximus in his ears, "Both alive and dead, your soul is lost, and you will never know the love of a woman again."  And he concealed his true idenity, and wrapped himself in cloaks and gloves, and forever looked for that which was lost.  And his legend grew, the legend of a hero, forsaken, forlorn and nameless, a pariah, feared by good and evil alike.  And he was known only as the Deathless Pariah.<br>_____________<br><br><br><br>This chap has been my Rime of the Ancient Mariner, the tale of that cursed sailor who was damned aboard his own ship for killing an albatross, and who was lost at sea and whose crewmen became like the undead, and who suffered through many a trial before his curse was finally lifted.  <br><br>I think I have found a resolution in this tale, and now may this curse, the Curse of the Deathless Pariah, finally be lifted!<br><br>Maintained the 16BAB, the 38AB, improved saves slightly, garnered an extra 5th spell slot, snatched all the Autostills, secured Epic Warding, increased hit points, and increased combat combos, like TrueStrke/Improved Disarm, TrueStrike/Knockdown, Called Shot, etc....<br><br>I forgot how tough this guy actually was.  As if his Immunities and high AC weren’t bad enough, all of his Extended spells are automatically AutoStilled-- hello Improved Invis, Elemental Shield and Mestil’s Acid Sheath, Keen Edge and Flame Weapon!  He can Premonition or Greater Sanctuary, Timestop or  pull out Epic Warding, and still nail his opponents with his mighty blade.  His True Seeing eliminates the Rogue threat, but with his immunity to sneaks they were never much of a threat to begin with.  He can slap an Extended Bigby’s Interposing Hand on the enemy to lower their AB by 10 (the last thing your opponent wants you to do when you’re coming at them lock, stock and smoking bone arm!).  And his maxed concentration combined with crit/sneak immunity insures his spells will be uninterrupted.<br><br>Playtested again, and Dwarflord approved.  He smokes everybody.  He just has too many aces up his sleeve for anyone to get a good drop on him.  Of course, heavy casters will probably tear him apart, but he can always Greater Sanctuary, or TIme Stop, summon the Ghoul King, and run like hell.<br><br>Human<br>Lawful Neutral<br><br><br><b>Deathless Pariah</b><br>Fighter14/Wizard10/Palemaster16<br><br><br><b>Attributes</b><br>Str16 (26)<br>Int16 (20)<br>Wis8<br>Dex8<br>Con16<br>Chr8<br><br>1 Fighter1, Weapon Focus, LoH, Lightning Reflexes<br>2 Fighter2, Knockdown<br>3 Fighter3, Blindfighting<br>4 Fighter4, Weapon Specialization, Str17<br>5 Fighter5<br>6 Wizard1, Still Spell<br>7 Wizard2<br>8 Wizard3, Str18<br>9 Wizard4, Extend Spell<br>10 Fighter6, Improved Knockdown<br>11 Fighter7<br>12 Fighter8, Improved Critical, Called Shot, Str19<br>13 Palemaster1<br>14 Palemaster2<br>15 Palemaster3, Disarm<br>16 Fighter9, Str20<br>17 Palemaster4<br>18 Fighter10, Improved Disarm, Toughness<br>19 Fighter11<br>20 Fighter12, Expertise, Int17<br>21 Wizard5, Epic Weapon Focus, Great Int I<br>22 Palemaster5<br>23 Palemaster6<br>24 Fighter13, Epic Weapon Specialization, Str21<br>25 Palemaster7<br>26 Palemaster8<br>27 Palemaster9, Great Str I<br>28 Palemaster10, Str23<br>29 Wizard6<br>30 Wizard7, Great Str II<br>31 Wizard8, <br>32 Wizard9, Int19<br>33 Wizard10, Great Int II, Epic Prowess<br>34 Palemaster11<br>35 Palemaster12<br>36 Palemaster13, AutoStill I &amp; II, Str25<br>37 Palemaster14<br>38 Palemaster15<br>39 Palemaster16, AutoStill III, Epic Warding<br>40 Fighter14, Armor Skin, Str26<br><br>AB: 38<br>AC: 36<br>Hit Points: 465<br><br>Fort: 27 (36)<br>Will: 22 (31)<br>Reflex: 18 (27) <br><br>Discipline: 43 (51)<br>Concentration: 43 (46)<br>Spellcraft: 42 (47)<br>Tumble: 20<br>Listen: 42<br>Heal: 43<br>Search: 10<br>Lore: 10<br><br><b>Special</b><br>Can Autostill all Extended Spells<br>Immunities: Criticals, Sneak Attack, Stun, Hold, Paralysis<br>Summons: Ghoul King<br>Deathtouch DC: 20 (don't actually use this)<br><br><b>Preferred Spells</b>:<br><br>1st(5): Truestrike, Mage Armor, Protection from Alignment<br>2nd(5): Bulls Strength, Cats Grace, Flame Weapon, Ultravision<br>3rd(5): Keen Edge, Invisibility Sphere<br>4th(5): Improved Invisibility, Lesser Spell Breach, Elemental Shield<br>5th(5): Mestil's Acid Sheath, Bigby's Interposing Hand, Lesser Spell Mantle<br>6th(4): Greater Spell Breach, True Seeing, Greater Stoneskin<br>7th(4): Spellmantle, Shadowshield<br>8th(3): Greater Sanctuary, Premonition<br>9th(2): , Timestop, Mord's Disjunction<br><br>Cheers, Mailman.

Well, Epic Warding gives you a huge advantage over everything that tries to hit you with physical damage (DR 50/+20). Epic Mage Armour merely gives you +20 AC (though more than often than not you will already have +5 items so it's only +5 Dodge AC).  IMHO, Epic Warding is the first epic spell to pick and perhaps even the only one worth a feat <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  This depends, however.<br>_________________<br>Too long I have suffered the desert sands of time~<br>But as I drown in darkness it will release the sign~<br>My soul will leave this mortal coil of flesh and earthly life~<br>to fly into the mist of night, into the nightside eclipse~<br> - by Emperor

Epic Warding is probably the best defensive buff in the game, excepting things like Greater Sanctuary, etc.  Epic Mage Armor is nice, and is probably better suited to a heavy caster.  A plate-wearing Palemaster spellsword can better spend his feats on other things.  He already has a solid array of great defensive buffs and has a decent supply of them.  It seemed more useful to get Int to 20 to get that extra 5th level spell slot for casting Extended Improved Invis or Elemental Shields which eventually become Autostilled <i>and</i>Extended.<br><br>You can further give yourself 1 additional spell slot per level if you pick a specialty school.  Illusion and Transutation (losing Conjuration in a build like this isn't a great loss, as there are very few spells from that list I would choose, with the exception of Mestil's) come to mind.  Necromancy is also a choice if you know you can obtain True Seeing on an item.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
