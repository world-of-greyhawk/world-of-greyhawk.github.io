Hello there. Just a few things. Your format was completely unreadable and close to the worst and most messy I have ever seen here. Next time use the standard format like everyone else. It's stickied at the top of the builds page. Do not cut-paste from somewhere and put it in quotes. Don't include all skills in level-progression. If you want to give out server specific items and abilities, do so in separate post after the original, or <b>at the bottom of your post</b>.<br><br>Don't take my words the wrong way, we are glad you post here, just use correct formatting next time as it makes it easier to get some feedback too. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

Defenses are kind of weak in this build, frankly.  The AC is good for a naked score, and you can increase it by buffing wisdom and dex both, but AC is all you have going for you, and the opponents who have the AB to hit you through it are almost certainly going to be quite capable of hurting you badly.  Saves (other than reflex) and hitpoints are both quite weak.  <br><br>You don't have a way to damage the sneak-attack immune either; coupled with your low saves, you should probably avoid fighting undead and dragons, at very least.  Maybe constructs and elementals too.<br><br>I'm pretty sure you can't take weapon finesse at level 1 as a monk.  It requires a BAB of +1 and monks start with BAB 0.  The earliest you can take it is level 3.<br><br>I'd advise dumping Called Shot and Improved Critical in favor of other feats.  Also, 20 spot does nothing for you.  Put those points into Spellcraft instead for some saving throw bonuses, that combined with Iron Will and Great Fortitude might give you a chance to save against death and mind magic.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Perhaps I was unclear, I don't expect it to hold up well in a straight up fight. The assassin class is named that for a reason, its not about a stand up, clean, honest fight.  Plain and simple, you do not give your enemy the oppertunity to hit.  This build hasted, will have 3 swings in the first 2 seconds of combat.<br><br>45d6(15d6*3)  In addition to normal/weapon damage.    Provided you play the assassin, as an assassin.<br><br>Admittedly, its a niche market to make a Monk/BG/AS. There is <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "178870", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>exactly 1 other build</a> that turns up with pulse cap's search engine. Call me crazy, but it works. Sure it can't kill every possible enemy.  That's a given.  Powerbuilding is like chess, there is build, and counterbuild.

I like sneakers, and villain type characters - a lot <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br>Have to agree with Xylo and others here, you need UMD and more HPs, and also need to get your saves up. Yes, BG has Dark Blessing, but your cha isn't of much help; true, you can find equip't to buff it, but unless it's a high magic world, .... Then, if it is, your victims will be all buffed up and likely immune to sneaks . . .<br><br>In any case, a couple of high level bard songs followed by war cry or an uber barbarian with Terrifying Rage - neither of these characters need to see you to hurt you, even assuming in the case of bard it's silly enough not to prepare itself to see invis. <br><br>Darkness is a great spell, I totally agree; but you need to be able yourself to see through it. As to sneaking, yes, you're somewhat faster than others due to monk and can run and potentially hide; I myself get a kick out of that tactic in single-player mods, but doesn't really work in PvP, especially if you plan on making use of your various death and sneaks. First strike may be on you, and now it's their turn. Plus, Barbarians have speed and spellslingers throw fire balls, bards have ice etc. etc. <br><br>Your AB for a sneaker is very good, especially with IKD, and your AC is very nice, too. So nice that I'd be inclined to drop the 1 AC in favor of more skills - UMD; also, would drop improved crit in favor of toughness; you don't have ED, and thus can't roll away. You need a few more HPs(sorry to belabor the point, really I am, but without ED, ...) DevCrit melee characters are gonna be quite upset if you sneak 'em, assuming they don't see you; assuming they've high saves and don't roll low on your assassin hit, ... and then there's all of their friends ...<br><br>Please don't misunderstand me, I like your build. It has a lot of neat features, and can dish out some damage. Very playable in a mod for sure; but your saves and HPs, notwithstanding those neat rabbit twix, could be problematic in PvP, where you can't stand still/hide and sneak attack at the same time, in a gang setting; just my two cents worth. Otherwise, neat and me thinks very playable for PvM/single player, for sure <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/21/06 19:49</span></i></p>

errrr.....just a question over here, well, two actually:<br><br>1) is it not the case that, if you cast darkness, the end result is that everyone in the zone of effect is treated as themselves having 50-% concealment, unless the attacker/caster has ultravision (i.e., to pierce the darkness in order to clearly attack, without said penalty, be it sneak or otherwise)??? and, if so<br><br>2) once darkness is pierced, say, by a person in the zone being attacked, by having ultravision (be it the bard/sorcerer etc. spell or UMD/scroll), then is it not also the case that the person, having so pierced said darkness, is in fact combat ready, seeing the attacker (unless otherwise flanked) and thus not susceptible to sneak so far as darkness is concerned?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/21/06 23:53</span></i></p>

Hmmm...I play on the same server with Riven, and the Ultravision thing was a mis-understanding...For SOME reason (and we've yet to exactly figure it out) he still gets sneaks from an Ultravision Potion, but DOESN'T get them from spells(Weird, huh? This is where the misunderstanding happened). BTW, Rangers get Ultravision as well...And True Seeing also counters darkness.

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>You know, having a wierd case of deja vu over here; I once, not so long ago actually, insisted up and down that a particular feat didn't work for a particular character - hmmmm, come to think of it, it was a monk sneaker build, too, and turns out that my game files were corrupted . . . (um, hearing that Twilight Zone music in the background <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">     (thanks Dragon - oh, and speaking of dragons, I believe that RDD darkvision makes 'em immune to darkness, too - wasn't sure about TS, though, and appreciate that info). But, yah, these folks kinda know what they're talking about, they're generous with their time, and only interested in making things better, which is a wonderful thing. I'm an "ole time PnP'r" and, while not by any means new to NWN, I'm thankful for the "keen eyes" of the folks here, whom I call my coach team <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Just to Reiterate, I like this build; it's got a lot of really good points, some neat rabbit twix, and very playable PvM/Single Player for sure, as I state above. Some of my other comments, and what Xylo and others are I do believe saying, would seemingly make this neat sneaker build that much better for PvP (should you want to of course)- but, hey, if there's a glitch in a server, where you playing at? Sounds like a place I wanna take all my sneaker/villain-types (it's all good, and again, really neat build).

Some info for you all. Ultravision <b>DOES</b>, as stated above, hinder everyone from getting any sneak-attacks from Darkness. True seeing <b>DOES NOT</b> help you against the effect of Darkness. Darkvision from RDD or any other source <b>DOES NOT</b> protect even the least from Darkness.<br><b>This is 100% tested info, and is correct!</b><br><br>Unless it has been modified where you play.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 03/06/06 18:56:45 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br>Trollborn Asgardian by the master of the Norse legends, Grimnir himself!<br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->
