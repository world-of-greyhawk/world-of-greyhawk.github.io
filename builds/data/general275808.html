I'm looking for a new server to play on. I'm bored with straight pvp and straight rp servers. Is there a server out there that combines nasty pvp with rp,has lots of quests and a good storyline? I would prefer either a dragonlance or forgotten realms type server, but will try just about any at this point. Thank you in advance for any and all suggestions.

Well, what servers have you tried already?<br><br>I liked DungeonEternal X when I checked it out last weekend, from what I saw it seemed quite reasonable on all accounts.

I play on Reconstructed Nordock.  It just started up again after a year of being down.  So everyone is starting fresh.  It's an RP server with PvP lite.  Some nerfs are being applied to balance things out, and other things are being added to compensate.<br><br>dev crit is being removed and no perma-haste.  They say they will put in a new version of hasty retreat that lasts 1 turn/level to compensate for haste nerf.<br><br>Check it out, it's in the RP section.  Lots of QM activity.

Well, I know one that may fit the bill.... it's a LOTR RP PVP server... officially it is an RP server and there plenty of it, but because it is LOTR, and therefore based around combat there are bosses to kill, cities to raid and as much PvP as you can sink your claws into... here's their forum if you want to check it out...<br><br><a href="http://elrondsworld.com/index.php" target="_blank">http://elrondsworld.com/index.php</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Fiend knight on 06/09/07 01:33</span></i></p>

I have played at Athas Reborn since SoU came out. It's based on the 2'nd edition Darksun setting. Imagine a world devestated by destructive magic, where the kings are evil epic wizards fighting over the last few liveable oasis. The races have been twisted in a particularly darwinian fashion. Dwarves are cruel and singleminded while elves are thieves and liars and halflings are cannibal savages. The server boasts all custom monsters, psionics, custom gear, over 300 areas with quests, npcs and a huge player-driven story arc. PvP is guild oriented, with factions such as the tempar, veilled alliance and draqoman struggling for resources with the player-run guilds. For a good time with some bad people, drop by the forums and DL some custom content at <a href="http://www.athasreborn.com/forum/" target="_blank">http://www.athasreborn.com/forum/</a>

Wheel of Time: The third age is out of service right now because the host is having problems with his computer, but it is a great server for your discreption. There is a lot of rp and you do get into PvP with other factions quite a bit. It should be running again in the roleplay section. Check It Out!!!
