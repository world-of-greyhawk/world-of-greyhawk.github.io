Hi I admit i'm absoultely useless in making a Mage or Socerer build so I need some advice as I level as one of the above, How do I build so that I get good DC saves for attack spells, but also build so my own DC for getting dispelled is Good... I understand the basic principle the higher you mage / Sorcerer level you are the better the spells DC and I guess your saves, but what other factors do i consider ? Im thinking Spellcraft helps ?

your DC is 10+(spell level)+(casting stat bonus)+(spell focus feats).  Spell focus will give you a +2 to DC, greater spell focus will give you a +4 to DC and epic spell focus will give you a +6 to DC.  Note that you only get the highest bonus, they don't stack.<br><br>So, say a Wizard 29/Sorc. 1/RDD 10 with an INT of 40 (+15 bonus) and an epic spell focus in Necromany casts Wail of the banshee (level 9). His DC would be 10+9+15+6=40. If he had an item that raised his INT by 12, he could increase that to 46.  46 being the highest possible DC for a PC cast spell in the game.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Ahhha sweet ok so I get how my DC works for attacking, How about the dispel does that work the same way IE on the server I play theres an Area where some Balor Lords  cast dispel when you enter the area is appears there DC attack is 29 ?.As a fighter I have some equipment that always gets dispelled DC save 22, But if I do do a spellcaster I would enter with spells off my own on by the time I enter this area I would have to be at least 16 - 20 lvl. Sorry if my explaination is scrambled not much of a spellcaster <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

I assume you're talking about 'buffs' being dispelled!<br><br>I don't think that will change much since the 'caster level' of the buffs are usually the same, as a spellcater you can protect yourself better though.

46 is the highest for a PC cast spell, without factoring in stat bonuses from equipment. 52 is the highest with maximum stat bonuses, so keep that in mind.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

So with the above calculations Does a Sorcerer work his Stat bonus of his Charisma, where the mage works of the Intelligence ?

Ah, my mistake.<br>And if you went 38 sorcerer 1 monk 1 pali or something like that you would have 7 regular epic feats and 5 sorcerer feats, which means you could take 10 great charisma as well as epic spell focus and even an epic spell.<br>Your short-term buffs would last longer and your SR penetration would be higher, and you'd have higher saves and evasion. So 45 DC max, which would be one less than the rdd/sorc/hs build (are you sure you can take great charisma with HS??)<br>Also with a lv 40 wizard you would have 7 epic feats and 9 wizard feats, which means you could take 14 great intelligence, an epic spell, and epic spell penetration, which means you could actually get int: 18+12+14=42, so 47 DC.<br><br>I think people are too tempted by the 10 rdd levels (+2 boost to int/cha) without realizing they'd actually get 3 feats during that time with a sorcerer (32, 35, 38) or, in the case of the wizard, four. In my experience, being closer to pure outweighs the stat advantage of rdd.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By yrtsns on 03/28/05 04:10</span></i></p>

I think you can only take 10 of the "Great INT" feats.
