This is one of my usual RP builds, which I never posted before for not being a powerbuild (yeah, Thax plays RP builds from time to time, avado is going to kill me for that blasphemy), but since the class combination isn't very used I thought I'd show it.<br><br>The concept is a Druid who was taken away from the forest when he was 6 years old, after that he was educated in a city by the Human society, so I thought Fighter would model it pretty decently, that way he learns to use Martial Weapons, which makes sense, and then I can pick a Halberd <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    <br><br>Initially, I made a story on how his grove was massacred and he ended in the care of some rude dudes, which also added that his spider died, so RP-wise this build has no Shapeshift nor Animal Companion, but it was pretty long and I never really wrote it down... so I didn't want to post it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_sleep2.gif">      <br><br>Playable 1-40 PvM<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Alignment: Any Neutral<br><br>Abilities:<br>STR: 16 (30)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 14<br>INT: 12<br>WIS: 16 (19)<br>CHA: 8<br><br>1 Druid1 - Spell Focus: Evocation, Spell Focus: Conjuration<br>2 Druid2<br>3 Druid3 - Empower Spell<br>4 Fighter1 - STR +1 (17), Weapon Focus: Halberd<br>5 Fight2 - Blind-Fight<br>6 Fighter3 - Greater Spell Focus: Evocation<br>7 Fighter4 - Weapon Specialization: Halberd<br>8 Druid4 - STR +1 (18)<br>9 Druid5 - Greater Spell Focus: Conjuration<br>10 Druid6<br>11 Druid7<br>12 Druid8 - WIS +1 (17), Improved Critical: Halberd<br>13 Druid9<br>14 Druid10<br>15 Druid11 - Spell Penetration<br>16 Druid12 - WIS +1 (18)<br>17 Druid13<br>18 Druid14 - Greater Spell Penetration<br>19 Druid15<br>20 Fighter5 - STR +1 (19)<br>21 Fighter6 - Great Strength I (20), Epic Weapon Focus: Halberd<br>22 Fighter7 <br>23 Fighter8 - Epic Weapon Specialization: Halberd<br>24 Druid16 - WIS +1 (19), Great Strength II (21)<br>25 Druid17<br>26 Druid18<br>27 Druid19 - Great Strentgh III (22)<br>28 Druid20 - STR +1 (23)<br>29 Druid21<br>30 Druid22 - Great Strength IV (24)<br>31 Druid23<br>32 Druid24 - STR +1 (25), Epic Spell Focus: Conjuration<br>33 Fighter9 - Great Strength V (26)<br>34 Druid25<br>35 Druid26<br>36 Druid27 - STR +1 (27), Great Strength VI (28), Epic Spell Focus: Evocation<br>37 Druid28<br>38 Druid29<br>39 Druid30 - Great Strength VII (29)<br>40 Fighter10 - STR +1 (30), Epic Prowess<br><br>Saving Throws:<br>Fortitude: 25<br>Reflex: 15<br>Will: 24<br><br>Skillpoints: 238<br>Animal Empathy: 42 (41)<br>Discipline: 43 (53)<br>Concentration: 43 (45)<br>Heal: 28 (32)<br>Spellcraft: 42 (43)<br>Tumble: 20<br><br>HP: 420 <br>AC (naked / Heavy Armor): 13/21<br>BAB: 26<br>AB: +40/+35/+30/+25<br>Damage: 1d10+21 Critical 19-20/X3 |piercing and slashing|<br><br><b>Long-term buffs:</b><br>Barkskin<br>Empowered Bull's Strength<br>Freedom<br>Death Ward<br>Spell Resistance (42)<br>Energy Buffer<br>Premonition (lasts for 300 damage)<br><br><b>Short-term buffs:</b><br>Blood Frenzy<br>Aura of Vitality<br><br>The spells DC isn't very amazing since his WIS is only 19, but I decided to take two Spell Focuses anyway and it's not completely useless, Storm of Vengeance can still paralyze a good deal of STR-based meleers and Fire Storm still deals neat damage.

There's no real reason to take Fighter other than the BAB and a feat or two, give it a Monk level and drop STR for WIS and even the Elder Earth Shape gets a higher STR, APR, AB and damage (and that's just before the dragon shape) plus the DCs and the will save go a lot higher. Power-wise, a Druid should melee while shifted, never with a weapon, and EWS doesn't work on shifts.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>I like it to tell you the truth, he's got a uniqueness that makes the build charming while he's not a poofter either.

Well, I certainly wasn't purposely imitating Jaheira. Truth be told, I never liked that Fighter/Druid multiclass build, she got out of my party as soon as I found 5 characters to ditch her and get a full party. Back on the days of Baldur's Gate spellswords didn't work very well (or, at all, with the lack of levels), it improved a bit with BG2 methinks, but I really never liked the Druid class until Neverwinter Nights (monk cheese may have had some relevance about that).<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/28/06 23:16:09 (GMT) -- Big Meph<br>Using the 2 ESF's in a dex based sneak build, <i>to me</i>, just looks like you're teasing your diabetic opponent with extra sugar on your whipcream covered chocolate mudcake.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/12/08 17:25</span></i></p>

What I saw in your build was a fighting druid that didn't focus on shapes or dragons, but used melee with spell support, which is what prompted me to think of the Jaheira thing since that was primarily all she was good for.  I actually thought she was a pretty good support character and was usually one of the last to fall in battle.  But let's not talk about that.  I just like fighting druid builds, which this one clearly is.  I also like the fact that you stuck to two classes and didn't throw in the obligatory 3rd class.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

If your looking for a non-monk/bard 3rd class option... you can replace 6 Epic Fighters with Champion of Torm. You'd get the same feats plus a +3 to your saves.
