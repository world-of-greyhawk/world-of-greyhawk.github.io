Hi there.<br><br>I've been (unsuccessfully) experimenting with high-con damage shield based mages who kill by shields only instead of nukes, just for fun, and tried a search on builds here. The thing closest to what I had in mind were gnome PMs mostly, but I didnt find any quite where I wanted them.<br><br>Wishes/thoughts:<br><br>Main class: Wizard, preferably lv 25+ for undispellable buffs and lasting shields. Wizard&gt;sorcerer due to number of spells needed.<br>Race:Dwarf/gnome, both get the Con bonus.<br>Starting Int at 15-16, starting Con at 16-18.<br><br>Starting to boost int to 20, then con all the way.<br><br>What I was interested in knowing was mainly what other classes would benefit this build? I guess PM for sneak/crit immune is a good idea, but apart from that..?<br><br>Perhaps Barbarian just to be mean, high hps and all, and rage boosts Con and Str, while lowering AC to get more hits in and more pain to others. Perhaps a wiz25/barb15, giving greater rage and undispellable shields, that would be wicked. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>I didnt really picture it as a melee char, so being able to hit others hard is not an important issue.<br><br>And would a build like this be effective in any settings? (I usually play low-magic PvE servers up to +5 on some, often only +2)<br><br>I'd like either a pointing to build similiar to this (dont need to include the barb part8)), or perhaps a general layout that I can work out from.<br><br>In advance: thanks.

Well, typically, the best PM spammers for a Wizard are 29 Wizard/1 Fighter/10 Palemaster.<br><br>But since you're going just for shield damage and not for spell power (which I don't understand why - if they don't wanna die they just won't attack you), you may want to toss in some Dwarven Defender.  Wizard 16 Palemaster 10 Dwarven Defender 14 would do OK for that.

I think you've pretty much got a good outline, although I don't see the advantage of adding any other classes other than maybe PM if you're worried about crits. A buddy of mine loves to play the high CON Sorcerer (and I'd recommend Sorcerer for this actually, since you get more spells per day. He just throws up the damage shields, Stoneskin or Premonition, and a few other buffs and then runs around the mobs, drawing AoOs from them. Not many of them last long.<br><br>The only other thing I can think of is maybe some CLC (enough to get the at least one of the regeneration spells. Then you can cast regen on yourself while you're being pummelled by the mobs). But that's getting into MAD territory (Multiple Attribute Dependency) and will make your ability score spread rather harsh, as you need 15 WIS for Monstrous regen and 17 WIS for Regenerate.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Since it is mainly for PvE I imagine you have lots of heal potions available so you might want to go with a pure dwarven wizard.<br><br>Go dwarf over gnome so you don't have small size restrictions.<br><br>Wizard<br><br>Mestils:1d6 + 80 = 86 MAX Acid<br>Elemental:1d6 + 40 = 46 MAX Fire<br>Death Armor: 1d4 + 5 = 9 MAX Magical<br><br>TOTAL = 141 Damage<br> <br>29W/10PM/1Rogue Dwarf<br>or go 1 Bard like Thax for Discipline. <br>Pre-Epic: 10 W/ 10 PM to max Fort<br><br>Mestils: 1d6 + 58 = 64 MAX Acid<br>Elemental: 1d6 + 29 = 35 MAX Fire<br>Death Armor: 1d4 + 5 = 9 MAX Magical<br><br>TOTAL = 108 Damage But Crit/Sneak Immunity<br><br>I would rock out the PM version with 21 or 22 CON, EDR 3, Epic Warding, Extend spell, 20ish AC O.o, 0 Tumble, and high heal skill if you dont have heal potions.

You can take Disarm to provoke a lot of AoOs, for that it's better to take 1 monk level and equip 2 kamas, you don't need to hit, you just need the APR to provoke the AoOs, even with the lowest BAB and without ITWF you still get 5 APR of a dual-wielding kama monk with flurry of blows activated.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Hmm... I think I'm starting to get the general idea.<br><br>But one thing: some of you mention DwD as a class here, with say.. 10-14 DwD and EDRIII gives me a 15-18 constant DR, would that be better than to rely on Premonition with less than 30 caster levels you think? Epic warding would be a good idea nonetheless, at least as an ace up the sleeve for tough fights.<br><br>I know this could likely prove to be a boring build, a not-very-powerful build, but at least its very player friendly, and not very much used (I don't want to make something twenty others have posted before me).<br><br>And why I thought Wiz&gt;Sorc was for two reasons: I thought I'd need very many different spells (I've never played a sorc build farther than lv 10ish, so I don't know how many different ones they gain all in all.), and that Dwarf was my planned race, so to avoid the racial Charisma negating from dwarves.<br><br>I think I'll try to build the wiz/barb version just for laughs, and then try something proper after I read through the ones you linked.<br><br>Thanks so far. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

I give Dwarven Defender as an option because I like the class, and it gives you unbreachable undispellable DR that never fades off.<br><br>Premonition can be breached but it is a higher amount of DR than the Dwarven Defender, it can be dispelled but duration is pretty good. If weapons on your server can't breach Premonition then you won't really need other DR sources.<br><br>Epic Warding rules, it can't be dispelled or breached and has the highest DR value but the duration is very low.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 08/30/07 23:43</span></i></p>

You die quite fast after Warding drops. Unless your server doesn't exceed +5 weapons.

If your server has Heal potions at easy access, it's quite likely that you kill whatever attacks you before you can have a chance to die.  Even w/o Epic Warding - just have to spam the heal pots.
