This is a sort-of rework of that <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "219155", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Ranger 16/Rogue 13/Monk 11</a> build I posted with a different class breakdown and better damage-output against sneak-vulnerable enemies and better saves but maintaining flexibility. I really like the idea of a stealther with monk-speed (who says you need to walk slow by going into stealth mode?) but keeping decent damage output. The other builds with these classes seemed to focus more on the monk-side rather than the rogue's but I like the latter better <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   The only things missing are HiPS and SC but I guess you can't have everything.<br><br>There was a possibility of getting SC IV easily using either Elf or Halfling as the starting race but the Elf would incur an Exp Penalty through most of the late Epic levels while the Halfling cannot dual-wield kamas without a -4 penalty. I could have gotten it with Human but it would probably mean putting WIS down to 8 and taking DEX to 18 at the start, taking 2 more Great DEX in Epic and using the last 2 General and Rogue feats on SC. It's probably worth it but... I guess I'll let you decide (advice anyone? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">   ). Starting with WIS 14 and DEX 16, you can only get SC II I think which I didn't really think was worth it.<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: any lawful, non-evil<br><b>1-40 PvM</b><br><br>Stats:<br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 16(30)<br>CON: 14<br>INT: 14<br>WIS: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>01: Rogue(1): Ambidexterity, Two-Weapon Fighting<br>02: Monk(1): M: (Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist)<br>03: Rogue(2): Weapon Finesse<br>04: Rogue(3): DEX+1, Ro: (Uncanny Dodge I), (DEX=17)<br>05: Monk(2): M: (Deflect Arrows)<br>06: Monk(3): Weapon Focus: Kama<br>07: Rogue(4) &lt;- Rogue-skills dump<br>08: Monk(4): DEX+1, (DEX=18)<br>09: Monk(5): Blind Fight<br>10: Monk(6): M: (Knockdown, Improved Knockdown)<br>11: Champion of Torm(1)<br>12: Rogue(5): DEX+1, Weapon Focus: Longbow, (DEX=19)<br>13: Champion of Torm(2): Improved Critical: Kama<br>14: Rogue(6)<br>15: Rogue(7): Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>16: Champion of Torm(3): DEX+1, CT: (Smite Evil), (DEX=20)<br>17: Champion of Torm(4): Point Blank Shot<br>18: Monk(7): Rapid Shot<br>19: Monk(8)<br>20: Rogue(8): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br><br>21: Rogue(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Kama<br>22: Monk(9): M: (Improved Evasion)<br>23: Rogue(10): Defensive Roll<br>24: Rogue(11): DEX+1, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=23)<br>25: Champion of Torm(5)<br>26: Champion of Torm(6): Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>27: Rogue(12): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=24)<br>28: Rogue(13): DEX+1, Epic Dodge, (DEX=25)<br>29: Champion of Torm(7)<br>30: Champion of Torm(8): Toughness*, Improved Critical: Longbow<br>31: Champion of Torm(9)<br>32: Champion of Torm(10): DEX+1, Epic Prowess, (DEX=26)<br>33: Rogue(14): Armor Skin*<br>34: Rogue(15)<br>35: Rogue(16): Crippling Strike*<br>36: Monk(10): DEX+1, Great Dexterity III, (DEX=28)<br>37: Rogue(17)<br>38: Rogue(18)<br>39: Rogue(19): Great Dexterity IV, Slippery Mind*, (DEX=29)<br>40: Monk(11): DEX+1, (DEX=30)<br><br>* = optional.

seeing some sneak attacking monk flying around in stealth with those saves makes me nervous...better buff up or stay hidden.  hope this monk doesn't infiltrate my home, or else i will have to start barring the door!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>i like the rework, although i still think the original is pretty nifty.  tough little sod.  elf seems an option, but the SC probably isn't that critical.  ED is there, and coupled with UMD impr invis is probbably fine in most cases.<br><br>nicely done, as usual.<br>_________________<br>"Perception is strong and sight weak.

I've finally gotten round' to testing my chars. I most especially wanted to test this gal since I've been playing her (the SC V version).<br><br>She could easily dispatch the level 40 adventurers in the Novice to Epic Character Maker module with mundane gear but had extreme trouble with the monsters deemed suitable for level 40 with mundane gear who were sneak immune and had DR. So unless you have weapons enchanted enough to byass DR or a steady supply of scrolls, wands and traps, don't expect to fight such things. However, they also had a very very hard time killing me.<br><br>Damage without sneaks and normal weapons was very low but with enough attacks per round and very good defenses, I found I could outlast most things. To my surprise, I also found the will save too low to fight that nasty dracolich without getting feared all the time (somehow, I had a whole string of low rolls) and kept dying to the prismatic dragon's prismatic spray death effect (he's HARD to hit). Oh well.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.
