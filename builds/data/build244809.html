Introduction:<br>Halfling Vindicator<br><br>This is a strange build. I got this idea of a build with Epic Dodge and decent Smiting capability, plus Sneak Attacks to add up damage.

A sneaker-smiter of small halfling stature? Neat!<br>Your AB for a sneaker-smiter is good, as is your damage; thinking, not quite sure how KD works being a halfling-does it make any difference? I know it does in weapon size, but no idea on the KD. If it does, might consider dropping it (or called shot) for Divine Shield, to get your AC up. At 25-CHA, you've a potential +7 enhancement to AC (more if however buffed); true, you've ED which is nice, but ....<br><br>HPs, hmmmmm. If you were to drop a GrtDex in favor of one more GS (it's another 24 sonic, to which most characters/creatures aren't immune, x's 3 smite attacks), then you could fit in Epic toughness for a few more HPs. Yes, your AB would drop by one to 39, and this would impact your AC, but if you take DS, then the latter wouldn't really be of any concern so to speak, since the divines' duration equal and last a number of rounds equal to your cha-bonus . . . you've ED to roll away, too, which is very nice. With all that great sneak damage already, and a suggested 3x24 more follow-on sonic - well, not sure how long an evil boss critter can withstand, but just a couple more rounds I should think (what, is he still standing? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> ) If you've higher HP and AC, along with still good buffable AB, should do fine if you need to go toe-to-toe also, indeed .... <br><br>What are you skills on this one? I'm assuming you're maxing out UMD and the usual sneaker stuff, yes? Just some food for thought <br><br>edit . . . sorry, just see the skills up there now; looking very good <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    <br><br>Nice build, Finn. As usual, you've really cool concepts; he's cool!.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/23/06 02:21</span></i></p>

AAARRGGHHH!!! I was going to post a build very similar to this a couple of days ago!!! But I only post builds that are tested, and I only got it to 28... then my computer died (permanently, I'm afraid) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  :sob:.<br><br>The only real dofferences between mine and yours is  less 2 levels in COT, that instead went into Pal. And rather then basing my damage on smiting, I get my damage from Divine Might and Divine Shield. Also because of Divine Might/shield my stats are different due to a need of 13 Starting STR.<br><br>*phooey*

Morning - yep, was me who mused about a way to get more HPs and potentially more playability pre-epic, but thought also that size affected KD'ing and so based was me suggestion (with stat changes necessarily implied). However, if it's only a +4 bonus to a human victim in terms of the KD, while a shame, it's still doable and thus not the end of the world. You've nice stealth and of course ED, which makes up for having under 400 HPs once all that neat stuff kicks in (a sneaker-smiter of small stature with some pretty neat abilities -- just so very neat, Finn! ... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">
