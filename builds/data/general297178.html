Yes, it will change things. Epic Dodge will require 30 ranks in Tumble, so that will make a lot of current Epic Dodge builds invalid.<br><br>I believe Whirlwind Attack will be fixed.<br><br>Here's a list of 1.69 changes/fixes from a post by the Dwarflord:<br><br>1. Fixed missing concealment bonus on the Shadowdancer's Epic Shadowlord<br><br>2. Fixed issue with Champions of Torm not being able to take Ambidexterity and Two Weapon Fighting as Bonus Feats<br><br>3. The Arcane Archer special abilities Imbue Arrow, Seeker Arrow, Hail of Arrows and Death Arrow now take into consideration the Epic Weapon Specialization feat<br><br>4. Evards Black Tentacles now applies the damage per tentacle, rather than all tentacle damage being applied at one<br><br>5. The Epic Dodge feat now requires 30 ranks of Tumble skill as a prerequisite, as per the description (feat.2da)<br><br>6. The "Dragon Shape" feat now requires Wild Shape 6x/day as per the description (feats.2da).<br><br>7. Fixed prerequisite for "Epic Weapon Focus Club" to be "Weapon Focus Club" rather than "Improved Critical Club" (feat.2da).<br><br>8. Weapon Specialization Club now requires four fighter levels to obtain (rather than one).<br><br>9. The "Rapid Reload" feat now gives you the proper number of extra attacks.<br><br>10. Added missing Trident weapon feats. -<br><br>11. Tridents are now classified as a "Martial" weapon, rather than a simple weapon.<br><br>12. Fixed how Damage Resistance works against weapons that do more than one type of damage (i.e. Morning Stars and Halberds). The target now uses the worst of the multiple damage resistances against weapons that inflict more than one base weapon damage type.<br><br>13. Fixes to Whirlwind/Improved Whirlwind/Great Cleave so that all the attacks are done at the player's full BAB.<br><br>14. The Defensive Roll feat now works 1/day as per the description.<br><br>15. Fixed the caster level being used for Holy Avengers (it is now always set to 10 as it is cast from an item, rather than using the player's paladin caster level).<br><br>16. Updated Weapon Finesse to work with all Creature Weapons regardless of the creature's size.<br><br>17. Amplify now requires a somatic component as per the spell description (spells.2da).<br><br>18. The spell War Cry now requires a somatic component as per the spell description (spells.2da).<br><br>19. Greater Sanctuary now requires a somatic component, as per the spell description (spells.2da).<br><br>20. Balagarn's Iron Horn now requires a somatic component, as per the spell description (spells.2da).<br><br>21. Clarity/Scare/Lesser Dispel can now be cast as a stilled spell (spells.2da Meta Magic column updated).<br><br>22. Greater Restoration can no longer be selected as an Extended Spell, as its duration is instantaneous<br><br>23. Added missing Trident Weapon Focus feat to Weapon Master.<br><br>24. Tweaked the way targets were being chosen for the Whirlwind feats.<br><br>25. Added Purple Dragon Knight Prestige Class<br><br>26. Added Ride Skill: Barbarian, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger, Champion of Torm, uses Dexterity, can be cross-trained.<br><br>27. Added Mounted Archery Feat:<br>Type of Feat: General<br>Prerequisite: Ride 1 rank, Mounted combat<br>Specifics: The attack penalty for using a bow while mounted is reduced from -4 to -2.<br>Use: Automatic.<br><br>28. Added Mounted Combat:<br>Type of Feat: General<br>Prerequisite: Ride 1 rank<br>Required for: Mounted archery<br>Specifics: While mounted, once per round you will attempt a ride check to increase your AC by 1 point for every 5 of the check result.<br>Use: Automatic.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

OK there's a LOT of fixes in the 1.69 which is all beneficial to the game, but my question is this. When will the 1.69 be available for updates? I have asked loads of players, but no one seems to know.
