A hybrid build is whatever a guy who thought about naming that thing like that thought, no really, I have no idea, and I guess it's just a way to call something else which does have a real name, understandable without the need of context, because I have no reference context here right now.

I think it just means a multi-class character. If the build is Rogue/Fighter/Wizard with a strong emphasis on Rogue then it would be a Rogue hybrid.

Hybrid, in this context, would mean that the character is more or less equally good at two or more 'classic' D&amp;D roles... Like a Rogue/Fighter, or a Fighter/Mage, or a Mage/Cleric, or whatever.<br><br>For example, if you're a Wizard who takes one level of Rogue to skilldump some stuff into UMD and Tumble, you're not a Hybrid character. If you're a Wizard who can also sneak, disarm traps, do decent sneak attacks, etc. Then you're a hybrid character.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By LuckyNephilim on 12/19/06 14:05</span></i></p>
