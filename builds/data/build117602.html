A better dmg. build than my cleric/bard/rdd. This build does 79 dmg minimum per hit. The last one did only 76.<br><br>I got to thinking and I found another way to improve on my cleri/bard/rdd build. That build did a minimum of 76 dmg. per hit, but I created a different build that will do a minimum of 79 dmg. per hit. The difference between this build and many others is that my builds will do this dmg to any enemy, no matter what their alignment is. People who use smite evil can do a lot more minimum dmg per hit than my builds, but it only works on evil enemies. My builds are focusing on hitting everybody for a minimum.<br><br>Starting Stats<br>Human True Neutral<br>Str 18<br>Dex 8<br>Con 8<br>Wis 14<br>Int 8<br>Cha 15<br><br>Dump all ability stats into strength.<br><br>Take levls like this:<br>*2 ftr<br>*7 cleric<br>*2 ftr<br>*1 champion of torm<br>*8 cleric<br>*1 ftr<br>*19 CoT<br><br>Skills – not very good, but the point was to do the most minimum dmg per hit<br>23 – spellcraft<br>11 – tumble<br>41 – discipline<br><br>Lvl___feat<br>1 power attack (human bonus)<br>1 improved power attack (ftr bonus)<br>1 weapon focus greatsword<br>2 cleave (ftr bonus)<br>3 divine might<br>6 extend spell<br>9 maximize spell<br>11 weapon specialization greatsword (ftr bonus)<br>*12 improved critical: greatsword<br>*15 knockdown<br>*18 toughness<br>21 great strength 1<br>22 great wis 1 (CoT bonus)<br>24 great strength 2<br>24 great wis 2 (CoT bonus)<br>26 great wis 3 (CoT bonus)<br>27 great strength 3<br>28 great wis 4 (CoT bonus)<br>30 great strength 4<br>30 epic weap focus (CoT bonus)<br>33 great strength 5<br>34 epic weap spec. greatsword (CoT bonus)<br>36 great strength 6<br>*38 epic prowess (CoT bonus)<br>*39 epic reflexes<br><br>*note: the feats with the “*” are optional to this build. You can submit different feats here and still have the same dmg.<br><br>Like my other build I took war and strength domains with cleric so I can raise my strength all the way to the +12 max. Also cast a maximized Eagle’s Splendor as your first buff because it affects things like divine power.<br><br>Ending stats:<br>Str 34<br>Dex 8<br>Con 8<br>Wis 18<br>Int 8<br>Cha 15<br><br>I went to 18 wisdom so I could have level 8 spells. This allows me to extend the level 7 spell “aura of vitality” which only lasts 1 round/level.<br><br>Totally naked, with no buffs, holding a greatsword my dmg looks like this:<br>2-12 +24 (crit 17-20/x2)<br>After I raise my strength to +12 with buffs my dmg looks like this:<br>2-12 + 33 (crit 17-20/x2)<br>With improved power attack my dmg is this:<br>2-12 + 43 (crit 17-20/x2)<br><br>MINIMUM dmg for this build per hit with no items.<br><br>+2 (2d6 greatsword)<br>+24 (base)<br>+9 (raising str to 46 gives 6 * 1.5 = 9)<br>+10 (improved power attack)<br>+5 physical (greater magic weapon)<br>+1 slashing (extended prayer)<br>+4 bludgeoning (war domain powers)<br>+2 magical (extended battletide)<br>+5 magical (divine favor)<br>+5 divine (divine might)<br>+6 divine (divine wrath)<br>+6 fire (darkfire)<br>-------<br>79 minimum dmg.<br><br>I admit this is only a 3 point improvement over my cleri/bard/rdd build. This character is even less rounded than my first post, mostly because this one doesn’t have spells like haste, keen edge, and the other bard spells. However, since I was only trying to do more dmg than the first build, I succeeded by 3 points.<br><br>A couple of other things about this build that make it different than my first one: this build gets 4 natural attacks per round because I have +16 bab in pre-epic. With divine power I can get 5 legitimate attacks per round. For those who wish to exploit the bug you can cast another divine power and get 6 attacks per round, but for the excellent char builds I think Jay will accept casting 1 divine power for an extra attack, but not 2. So, let’s just say the build can get 5 “legit” attacks per round.<br><br>One of the buffs (you should cast it right before engaging the enemy) only lasts a number of rounds = charisma modifier so it runs out after 5 rounds. This build has a ton better saves than my cleric/bard/rdd thanks to the CoT levels. For those who are wondering, I went 20 CoT for the extra damage for divine wrath and the extra feats. I would really appreciate it if the community could suggest a way to maybe tweak the build a little, if it will actually get me more dmg. Maybe change starting stats or something?<br><br>Also, I will be submitting this to Torias on the excel spreadsheet he gave me. I need a name and a short description (one paragraph) describing this character’s history or purpose. If some of you want to help me on the name and history I will give you credit for it when I submit to Torias. If Jay chooses it, you would get credit too.<br><br>cdaulepp<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 16:18</span></i></p>
