This is a level 40 single class build where I maximize the Ranger's Favored Enemy bonus with the Bane of Enemies feat in a strenght build to make a real Damage Dealer. He will have this power against 15 different racial groups. I have not specified these because I think you should choose based on your environment. <br>I have given this character a high Spot skill so he can seek out his enemies, but this can be changed if you want to focus on another class skill or cross class with tumble or spellcraft for better AC or saves. <br>The weakness of this build is the defense: low AC and nothing extra to the saves. As a front line brawler he will bleed a lot, but on the other hand, he is able to kill the enemy quickly! He will be aided in this by an animal companion that he can buff with Cat's grace and GMF. I prefer the flanking sneak attacks of the panther.<br>The character wields a Greatsword (Weapon focus) and wears a Breastplate or Chainmail. Cat's grace can help add the dex bonus available with these armor types.<br>He will get the bonuses against Favored Enemies with any weapon, so he's free to switch. This means he can switch to sword and board when needed and still keep all the bonuses against the Favored Enemies . The weapon focuses will give him a +3 bonus to AB when he wields the Greatsword. <br><br>Bane of all - Playable from 1 to 40, PvM<br><br>Ranger 40<br>Race: Half Orc<br>Alignment:Any<br><br>Starting stats:<br>Str : 20<br>Dex : 10<br>Con : 14<br>Wis : 14<br>Int : 6<br>Cha : 6<br><br><br>Leveling: Ranger taken at all levels, Strenght at all ability rises<br><br>1 Power attack, Favored Enemy 1<br>2 <br>3 Cleave<br>4 <br>5 Favored Enemy 2<br>6 Knockdown<br>7 <br>8 <br>9 Weapon Focus Greatsword<br>10 Favored Enemy 3<br>11 <br>12 Blind fight<br>13 <br>14 <br>15 Improved Critical Greatsword, Favored Enemy 4<br>16 <br>17 <br>18 Toughness<br>19<br>20 Favored Enemy 5<br>21Bane of Enemies<br>22<br>23 Favored Enemy 6*<br>24 Epic Weapon Focus<br>25 Favored Enemy 7, <br>26 Favored Enemy 8*<br>27 Epic Prowess<br>28 <br>29 Favored Enemy 9*<br>30 Great Strenght I, Favored Enemy 10<br>31 <br>32 Favored Enemy 11*<br>33 Great Strenght II<br>34 <br>35 Favored Enemy 12,Favored Enemy 13*<br>36 Great Strenght III<br>37 <br>38 Favored Enemy 14*<br>39 Great Strenght IV<br>40 Favored Enemy 15<br><br>*Ranger bonus feat<br><br>Ending stats:<br>Str : 34<br>Dex : 10<br>Con : 14<br>Wis : 14<br>Int : 6<br>Cha : 6<br><br><br>Skills: Discipline 43 (55), Spot 43 (45) (54 against FE)<br>HP: 520, Maxed every level<br><br>AC: With mundane Chainmail: 15 (16-17 with Cat's).

That's a good point. He's not a high AC tank.<br>The Rangers can be made much stronger by light multiclassing, but this time I've responded to the call for pure builds and made a pure Ranger to demonstrate what can be done with the Ranger class alone.<br>His survivability also depends on the environment, who he parties with, how you play him and to some degree on what items that are available. It is not a good idea to let him get swarmed alone by hard hitters. If you avoid that, by playing in a group or by singleing out creatures, he will do all right. You also have the sword and board alternative if you need more AC.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 02/02/06 14:00</span></i></p>

Get heavy armor proficiency and rise starting INT to at least 10 (drop starting STR to 18), maxed tumble will give you +4 AC, wear full plate and keep a sword and board combo quickslotted for when you need AC. Expertise is a feat worth considering. Drop one FE and get epic prowess with the bonus feat and AS with the general feat.<br>I'd also consider getting BoE as a ranger bonus feat and the same goes for EWF (you can drop another FE for that, you've got plenty anyhow) and grab some save boosters with general feats. <br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 02/02/06 23:02</span></i></p>

If you're not going for dual-wielding (which btw causes massive damage with BoE), then get heavy armour proficiency. No reason not to. And listen to Kail.<br><br>*edit: typo's...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 02/03/06 06:17</span></i></p>

"You give some good advice here if you want to focus more on the defense." I disagree. That's great advice that would make the build better, more survivable. It's not fucusing on defense, it's balancing.

I have always thought of rangers as being dex-based, and using two weapons and/or ranged weapons. The low str damage is made up for by the favored enemy damage. This one gets 13 FE's - I picked all non-humanoids, so this is a PvE build. If you want to do PvP, replace some of the enemies with Human, Elf, Dwarf, etc. <br><br>Ranger(40), Elf<br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 18 (34)<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 480<br>Skillpoints: 258<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 23/18/28<br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 46 (melee), 43 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 26/29 (Can get to 39 with IE).<br>Skills: Discipline 43(43), Hide 43(55), Listen 43(47), Move Silently 43(55), Set Trap 43(55), Tumble 20(32)<br><br>L01: Ranger(1): Weapon Finesse, Favored Enemy: Undeads, R: (Dual Wield)<br>L02: Ranger(2)<br>L03: Ranger(3): Weapon Focus: Shortsword<br>L04: Ranger(4): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br>L05: Ranger(5): Favored Enemy: Outsiders<br>L06: Ranger(6): Expertise<br>L07: Ranger(7)<br>L08: Ranger(8): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>L09: Ranger(9): Knockdown, R: (Improved Two-Weapon Fighting)<br>L10: Ranger(10): Favored Enemy: Constructs<br>L11: Ranger(11)<br>L12: Ranger(12): DEX+1, Improved Knockdown, (DEX=21)<br>L13: Ranger(13)<br>L14: Ranger(14)<br>L15: Ranger(15): Improved Expertise, Favored Enemy: Dragons<br>L16: Ranger(16): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>L17: Ranger(17)<br>L18: Ranger(18): Toughness<br>L19: Ranger(19)<br>L20: Ranger(20): DEX+1, Favored Enemy: Elementals, (DEX=23)<br>L21: Ranger(21): Bane of Enemies<br>L22: Ranger(22)<br>L23: Ranger(23): Epic Weapon Focus: Shortsword<br>L24: Ranger(24): DEX+1, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=25)<br>L25: Ranger(25): Epic Prowess<br>L26: Ranger(26): Favored Enemy: Aberrations<br>L27: Ranger(27): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=26)<br>L28: Ranger(28): DEX+1, (DEX=27)<br>L29: Ranger(29): Favored Enemy: Magical Beasts<br>L30: Ranger(30): Great Dexterity III, Favored Enemy: Monstrous Humanoids, (DEX=28)<br>L31: Ranger(31)<br>L32: Ranger(32): DEX+1, Favored Enemy: Shapechangers, (DEX=29)<br>L33: Ranger(33): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=30)<br>L34: Ranger(34)<br>L35: Ranger(35): Favored Enemy: Giants, Favored Enemy: Beasts<br>L36: Ranger(36): DEX+1, Great Dexterity V, (DEX=32)<br>L37: Ranger(37)<br>L38: Ranger(38): Favored Enemy: Fey<br>L39: Ranger(39): Great Dexterity VI, (DEX=33)<br>L40: Ranger(40): DEX+1, Favored Enemy: Reptilian Humanoids, (DEX=34)<br><br>Like I said, you could take different FE's depending on what you will be facing. I included all of the crit-resistant ones. You could go with a human, and use the extra feat to pick Weap Prof: Exotic and use Kukri's instead of Shortswords. You could also use Handaxe if you prefer a higher crit multiplier with lower crit range, or use a rapier or scimitar if you don't want to dual-wield, or don't mind the extra -2 AB (he will still be pretty good with a rapier or scim for sword-and-board if you want to use it). He will get 6 attacks per round when dual-wielding, and be able to switch to sword-and-board when he wants more AC. He will use light armor or robes, obviously. He will also be able to use stealth and trap tactics effectively - scout out the enemy, lay some deadly traps in the area, then stand on the far side of the traps and start firing arrows to get their attention, forcing them to cross the traps to reach him. His ranged damage will be approaching AA levels thanks to the FE bonuses. <br><br>TM

In my opinion there are three major ways of building a Ranger.<br><br>1) Strenght based damage dealer, like this build.<br>2) Strength based dual wielder. Uses stealth and light armor. Has some dex + Cat's to fill the armor dex bonus. Can wield medium sized weapons and the exotic double weapons. Has slightly lower AB and damage than the first type, but gets more attacks per round. Here is an example of a pure build of this type(this one with small/tiny weapon): <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "229276", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>3) Dexterity based archer/dual wielder. Uses stealth. Great damage with bows and finesse weapons against FE's. Can get in trouble because it lacks Uncanny dodge.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 02/03/06 18:48</span></i></p>

Reg Number3:<br>Two levels of Assassin are all you need.  You get improved saves (reflex?  forget exactly which) if you can sacrifice 1ab; at worst taking it at late epic you will have class access to tumble; and umd to boot.  And if evil is not your bag, you can shoot for SD; but then the req's are at the cost of two feats.
