Was going to build a new character based on the <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_kukrimaster.html" target="_blank">kukri master</a>, but since it is probably old build, was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on improving him a bit. It's for a RP server, and while most things fit, I want to give him a high persuade. Any suggestions on how best to improve him as a warrior and also sneak in a class change to get the persuade?<br><br>The reason I chose the kukri master is that my character must be human, not use any magic (he can have it as long as he doesn't use it), and he's rather old so the light weapons and more skillful approach seemed right. Searched and found some similar builds but most with little feedback so wanted to give it a last check.<br><br>Probably a silly question, but I'm really a RPer not a builder <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    Thanks in advance for the help.<br><br>~Leti<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Letifer on 11/10/06 21:44</span></i></p>

No class change.  Just swap out the Appraise ranks for Persuade ranks.  My suggestions, anyway.
