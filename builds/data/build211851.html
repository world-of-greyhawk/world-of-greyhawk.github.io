I left it open, generally I don't like to tie people into a particular weapon.  Though with the low dex on this character I wouldn't recommend a two-handed weapon.  Longsword and Tower shield would be classical.  Obviously a holy avenger if you could find one.

I wonder what monk brings? Your saves are high enough without it, The only advantage I can see is IKD. Take more Paladin levels, or I would even think fighter. Would net you EWS if you like, and let you keep KD, the only thing you lose would be evasion and IKD, which you would need int 13 for.<br><br> 6 fighter levs would net you 4 feats, f.ex, WS, EWS and KD, and one to spare, unless you start with INT 13 and WIS 13 and then compensates wis with one of your CoT feats. With 13 int you can get IKD with the 4th feat you gain. You lose some saves (but they are high enough) and evasion. You gain 6 more damage with every blow.<br><br>I really don't see why you raise WIS to 16 either, but it is perhaps the only feats gained as CoT at that point?<br> I have never seen Imp Power attack to be of any use either, switch it for Extra Smiting or Extra turning for more uses of Divine shield and -might.<br><br>It is a nice solid build, but has room for some tweaking, which doesn't necessary make it any better, tho <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

I don't see why you would need that high wisdom. You could easily start with 12, or even lower. And your damage reduction from Divine Wrath should be like 30/+5 or so <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

wis serves no purpose being this high.  leave it alone since you don't even get any paladin spells for this build.<br><br>with monk levels you should be able to put tumble to more than 20, since that is no point in using it to get a 20, which is attainable by cross classing.<br><br>just curious why these decisions were made.<br><br>-c

He has all his monk levels at lvl 10, so Tumble is already cross-classed somewhat. I do actually think you could drop wis to 8, and use those points in ANY OF THE OTHER ATTRIBUTES! You need wis THE LEAST of all attributes in this fella. And if you relly want monk in this guy, take alevel or two epic, to get a Tumble skill dump, it will net you +4 AC.

He can keep Pal4/Fghtr6/CoT30<br>since CoT has EWS on his bonus feat list. CoT lacks WS, which you must take as a fighter, then use one of the CoT bonus feats for EWS. Sorry I didn't specify. Oh, and yeah, the monk gets a speed bonus to, which not always works in armor, and evasion. I still think fighter is a viable choice, as stated.

Thanks for the feedback everyone. I have looked into replacing monk with fighter. I think I took monk originally to keep the saves high, and to get some AC bonus, as well as to get IKD without requiring 13 Int.<br><br>To change the characted over to a fighter version you need to do the following over the first 10 levels.<br><br>STR: 15 (26)<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 10<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 14 (16)<br><br>01: F(1): Luck of Heros, Weapon Focus, Power Attack<br>02: F(2): Cleave<br>03: P(1): Knockdown, P: (Divine Health, Lay on Hands)<br>04: P(2): STR+1, P: (Aura of Courage, Smite Evil),(STR=16)<br>05: F(3)<br>06: P(3): Divine Might, P: (Turn Undead)<br>07: F(4): Weapon Specialization<br>08: F(5): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>09: P(4): Divine Shield<br>10: F(6): Improved Knockdown<br><br>I dropped Called Shot and Improved Power Attack for Disarm and Imp Disarm, but you can tailor that to suit your own needs.<br><br>Then at 24 take EWS rather than Epic Prowess and bump the rest of the CoT epic feats down 4 levels.  I didn't take Great Wis at 40 I then took DevCrit. I'm not a fan, but you are really running out of CoT bonus feats to take.  Another option would be Epic Toughness.<br><br>By dropping Monk you lose free feats of Cleave, KD and IKD.  Taking 6 Figther levels gives you 4 back so you taked Cleave, KD, IKD and Weapon Spec.<br><br>The 14 Int actually gives you too many skill points!  I took the following:<br><br>Craft Armor 5(7), Craft Weapon 5(7), Discipline 43(51), Heal 43(43), Lore 43(45), Spellcraft 18(20), Tumble 20(20)<br><br>The rough comparison is as follows:<br><br><b>Monk Version</b><br>AB: 40/35/30/25<br>HP: 468<br>AC: 19/26 naked/armor&amp;shield<br>Fort: 53<br>Will: 47<br>Refl: 47<br>Skills: 184<br><br><b>Fighter Version</b><br>AB: 42/37/32/27<br>HP: 480<br>AC: 16/27 naked/armor&amp;shield<br>Fort: 53<br>Will: 41<br>Refl: 45<br>Skills: 215
