Sorry but I still dont know how this works. I understand that PMs receive spell levels but how do they gain spell slots? When I have made such builds (i.e 5 Wizard, 11 PM) I cant cast the spell levels received as I dont have spell slots. Do the spell slots become active once I place spell scrolls into the spell level?

In other words, a Wizard/PM has the slots of a level (X +(Y +1) / 2) Wizard, where X = Wizard levels and Y = PM levels. For example, your Wizard 5/PM 11 build has the slots of a level (5 +(11 +1) / 2) = (5 +12 / 2) = (5 +6) = 11 Wizard. That means you have 6th level spells.

NOt to take anything away from the master finn, but you also need to have 19 in intelligence.  It is  SOO  obvious that I had designed a build with pm a few years ago and forgot just that!

YEP!  I speak from experience <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">     I can remember so vividly the wiz/pm/dd I built years ago, spending a few days tryin to figure out why, even though I had 16 pm lvls I couldnt get lv 6-9 spells, until I finally realized I only had 15 Intelligence...  well in real life it felt like I had bout 6!  Dwarves you know <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif"> <br><br>Peace

The 6th level spells refers to the level of spell!   Wizards start off with level 1 spells and cantrips (level 0).  Then at 3rd lvl they learn level 2 spells.  At 5th they learn lv 3.  At 7th they learn lv 4 spells.  And at 9th they learn lv 5 spells.  Lv 11 is LV 6!!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     Then 13 is lv 7.  15  is lv 8.  And 17 is Lv 9.   <br><br>So, to get lv 9 spells with a PM/Wiz, you need Finn's equation to = 17 minimum WITH and Intelligence of 19 at least.   You make X=wizard lvl and Y=PM lvs (like he has it) and away you go!   <br><br>For example, it is really popular to take 15 pm lvls.  By finns equation (which is biowares equation) you have 8 wizard lvls.  So, to have Lv 9 spells you need to have 11 PURE wizard lvls.    Hope that helps.

Yes.  <br><br>Another example = Wizard10/PM13 can have 9th lvl spell slots.  10+7= 17.<br><br>The easiest way to figure it is that the PM gains the new spell slots on odd levels.  So, PM9 &amp;1 PM10 both are the same, 11 &amp; 12, 13 &amp;14, etc...<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

So then this apllies to bards and sorcerers as well I take it.<br>For example a level 14 bard and 16 PM with a CHA of 16 will be equivalent to a 22 level bard, therefore having 6th level spells and at least 4 uses of spells per day.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Jehoshua on 05/01/06 15:25</span></i></p>

Sorcerers do not gain spells via scrolls, so the only way you will be casting spells of those higher levels is by gaining a new sor level and selecting a spell, or casting a metamagic version of a known spell (maximized, enhanced, etc...)<br><br><br>Opening up a new spell slot does not mean gaining a new spell.<br><br>Keeping that in mind, you should be ok.
