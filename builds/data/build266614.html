Hey, Ithacan.  Just wondering what the point is to Wizard5.  I see you use that bonus feat for a Great Int.  Not sure what that's about.  Also see that your Dex-based, but yet fall short of both Epic Dodge, SC Feats, Empty Body, Improved Invis, etc.  Do you think you might benefit a bit more by dropping SD5 in there for Epic Dodge?  or at the least Rogue or Assassin for some UMD and Uncanny Dodge?  I gather that you are taking the Wiz5 for stacking Bulls, and to have Eagles and/or Cats Grace, yes?  Having such a capacity, especially as short-lived as those are with your current caster level, can hardly hold a candle to having Uncanny and Epic Dodge, no?<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Good to see you, Grizzled One.<br><br>The idea is a high-fortitude dexterity sneaker who in turn will be hard to HiPS, pretty fast, and deal out some damage.  <br><br>There are three ways to hit something with the AB that this generates: 1) APR, which it will do, 2) True Strike, and 3) HiPS.  Assassin, SD and Wiz will get you the APR route.  So you've a choice, True Strike to IKD for sneaks, or HiPS for IKD and sneaks.  I chose Wizard for two reasons: 1) it had not been done before at all (according to the search engine), and 2) I like using scrolls, which the spellcraft of this one will permit (all wizard scrolls, anyway).  <br><br>Using the Wiz bonus feat for Int 13 permits the learning and casting of 3rd level spells.<br><br>I went ahead and scripted it as SD; it's pretty nice.  I love uncanny dodge and epic dodge.  I don't like not having any mechanism for buffing.  You are not trading uncanny dodge and epic dodge for stacked bull's strength (heck, on the Badlands that is useless due to the accessible/craftable gear).  You'd be trading for stoneskin, greater stoneskin, imp. invis., mind blank, etc. AND true strike.  While you'd gain dodge and mobility as pre epic feats, you'd lose great fortitude and blind fight.  :|  btw, a similar build has been done, the Black-Hearted Shadow Elf by the estimable Xylophone: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "218337", "", ".", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>  He takes Monk to 19 instead of BG to pick up empty body.  That is something I'd really consider, but with this build, you'd get there by giving up two levels of wizard, putting them in monk to 18, and getting empty body. . . <br><br>Now assassin is another animal.  At really no cost (you're already evil and the skill set bump from wiz to assassin covers the Hide/MS skill requirements) you get uncanny dodge and can use UMD for buffing. . . just trade spellcraft (and the attendant saving throws v. spells) for UMD.  <br><br>But you don't have HiPS or true strike, so you are left with only APR to hit high AC foes.  I like to have a more reliable option than that.  :|<br><br>Anyway, build to taste.  Thanks for the feedback.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Ithacan<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Ithacan on 02/20/07 20:17</span></i></p>

Not sure why you take power attack and Divine Shield. In this build you won't have room for CHA-gear, since you rather want DEX/WIS maybe even STR. The only thing I can see is perhaps potions of Eagle's.<br><br>Good to see a veteran build again though, and still with the characteristic names you bring forth. Quite decent build though, I like the class-mix.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Thanks, Grimnir.<br><br>In a lower magic setting, you would forgo Power Attack and Divine Shield, no question.  That would free you up on your abilities, too, and open up some additional feats.<br><br>In a setting where you can max out your stats, this build gets very high AC (80) with Divine Shield and pretty good AC (72) without it.  <br><br>It's designed for the latter setting.  <br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Ithacan
