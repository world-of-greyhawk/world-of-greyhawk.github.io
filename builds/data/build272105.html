<i>Trapping, Slashing and Defending the Forest without Mercy PvM (1-40) and PvP</i><br><br>The WILD HUNTER (“Eternal Warden”)<br>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Note to Readers: build follows in the next post, keeping with my recent ranger theme-builds (c’mon, a dev.critter has to follow!); s/he’s to be found immediately after the story (based on Norse/Celtic “Wild Hunt” lore, which I hope everyone here enjoys! ~ Tyr <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><b>The Curse of the Unicorn</b><br><b>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar</b><br><br>Close to death, and drawing what he believed to be his last breath, the Wild Hunter looked up from his forest bed where he had been cruelly left to die, to see a ghostly apparition, in the form of a beautiful woman, with golden hair and dressed in white, who had suddenly appeared before him.<br><br>“Have you come to take me to Valhalla?” the Wild Hunter asked, coughing, blood pouring from his mouth and chest, from the wounds he had less than an hour ago suffered from the deadly horn of a unicorn, whom he had killed in order to save the life of his King’s only daughter. But an innocent child, whom the King had brought along with his hunting party, of which the Wild Hunter was a member, in order to lure and hunt down a unicorn for its horn–the ultimate medieval trophy. <br><br>It was believed by medieval doctors that the horn was filled with magic, a cure for poison in fact; and that one need only dip its tip into food or wine, or crush it up and eat it, to rid one’s body and edibles of impurities. That aside, the king had thought it would make a lovely decoration on his stone hearth mantle, and had for many years to no avail tried to capture or kill a unicorn on his own. After coming home empty-handed for so many years, the King finally thought to consult the experts in such matters, his royal doctors, who informed him that the best method to capture a unicorn, a pure and innocent beast, was to lure it out with something else that was pure and innocent, and reason why the King decided to bring along his daughter as bait: to his amazement, it worked like a charm, her very presence attracted a unicorn, which came out of nowhere it seemed to him, neither scared nor nervous, but instead walking right up to the young girl; gently, it lay its head into the young girl’s lap, wanting her to pet it. And she did. It was then that the King struck, recklessly, with no concern for his daughter’s life, the King unsheathed his sword and aimed for the horn, but in the process only managed to scare the beast, its horn nearly skewering his daughter. <br><br>Quick thinking, and desperate to save the young girl’s life, the Wild Hunter leaped into action: launching into the fray with his axes drawn, wrestling with the beast to pull it away from the young girl. Slashing at the beat and bringing it down, to its death, Wild Hunter saved the young girl’s life but was himself skewered by the horn in the process. <br><br>Having neither any concern nor gratitude for the Wild Hunter, who clearly had saved his daughter’s life and now lay mortally wounded and dying before him as a result, the King fetched the horn for himself, and ordered his party out of the forest; whether for fear of Odin’s retribution, or simply out of cruelty, by the King’s orders the Wild Hunter lay alone, abandoned in the forest, dying.<br><br>It was, as everyone clearly knew, a crime under Odin’s law to hunt unicorns, some beasts being more pure and important than others, with the unicorn being at the very top of the heap. The King as such believed himself to be above Odin’s law; well understanding that members of his hunting party may not feel similarly about such matters, and that they otherwise might not want to come, the King had lied to his hunting party, telling them they would be out hunting deer; had the Wild Hunter known the truth, that he was partaking on a unicorn hunt, he would have not gone. <br><br>“Is it time for me to rise to Valhalla?” the Wild Hunter asked of the ghost again, in between painful bouts of blood-gurgled coughing.<br><br>“No, it is not,” replied the ghostly apparition. “I am Freya, the Goddess of Love, Beauty, War, Magic, Wisdom and the Hunt, and you are dead, but not yet dead, and I have come to hear your explanation as to why you killed my beautiful unicorn.”<br><br>Wiping blood from his mouth, in agonizing pain, trying his best to clean himself up despite the pain, for such a distinguished honor of meeting a goddess, Wild Hunter thought carefully before responding: “your grace, m’ lady, in Odin’s name forgive me, for I had no choice… I …”<br><br>“Yes, yes,” she interrupted. “You had to save the life of an innocent, but in the process took the life of an innocent which you did not know you hunted. I am a goddess, after all, and therefore not blind.” <br><br>She pondered this for a moment, realizing that, while it was not entirely the Wild Hunter’s fault, a unicorn lay dead, against Odin’s law, and justice of some sort had to be carried out. It did not take her long to judge.<br><br>“Wild Hunter, as the Goddess of the Hunt, it saddens and angers me that you have killed one of my beautiful unicorns, but as the Goddess of Wisdom, I understand your motives, which were neither cruel nor unjust, for you were lied to by your King who will, I assure you, pay dearly for what he has done. But at the same time, it was your blade which brought down my great unicorn, and in Odin’s name you must bear some of the responsibility. <br><br>“After carefully assessing the situation, and seeing that you are dead, but not yet dead, and yet you cannot yet go to Valhalla for having broken Odin’s law, as this has made you unacceptable to the Valykries. That said, I do not find you evil enough to justify your eternal suffering. And so, rather than send you to Hel, I will instead return you to earth, to life, but not a life as you know it; rather, you will become an immortal, like the unicorn you slay, suffering the curse of the unicorn to wander and think on what you’ve done, and to query whether it is just to slay an innocent to save another innocent. At the same time, I hereby give you the gift of eternal time, in order for you to repent and prove yourself worthy of Valhalla, in Odin’s name, at which time the Valykries shall surely come to fetch you. I give you this gift of time, and it is my hope, Wild Hunter, that you use it wisely.”<br><br>And, with that, and a chant of a spell, Freya was gone, vanished, as quickly as she had appeared, and with her went all his pain and suffering. In a strange twist, she had spared his death, thus saving his after-life, by cursing his life with immortality, which curse would end with his rising to Valhalla, but only if he redeemed himself; an eternity to seek redemption, and so it was. Returned to life and yet not life, the Wild Hunter was healed, but he discovered soon after that suddenly gone were his skills in hunting and tracking – a fitting punishment, perhaps, for having killed a unicorn; but in its stead, he found that he had received the power of the god’s, that of the power to dish out devastating criticals— no longer bound by the King’s laws, but only Odin’s now, the Wild Hunter decided it a fitting redemption for him to hunt and instantly slay unicorn hunters instead, and hence defending the very beast responsible for what to him is both a curse and a blessing at the same time. <br><br>It is also said that Freya, the Goddess of the Hunt, returns once a year to visit and check up on the Wild Hunter; so eager and delighted to share with her his tales of all the mortals he killed, and hence all the unicorns he in turned saved, that she has relented somewhat in her punishment, by returning to him his hunting and tracking skills once a year, if only for a short time, but each and every year, so that he may join with her and other ghostly companions to do that which he loves best – hunting, by partaking in the annual Wild Hunt in search of what for him is the ultimate prize: his former King, who on death was found guilty for the death of the unicorn, among other sins, and forced to reappear each year as the prey, the ultimate prize to be hunted, by villains and heroes alike, in the annual ceremony.  <br><br>It was also believed, according to ancient Chinese folklore, and also by Europeans during medieval times, that the lion, as represented by the sun, and the unicorn, as represented by the moon, are embroiled in a constant struggle with each other, neither being evil or good in the purest sense but, rather, that the struggle is one of balance, and therefore necessary to the world, for without which the world would have neither night (unicorn) nor day (lion), but instead suffer an eternal eclipse.<br><br>So, the next time you look to the sky and see an eclipse, you might remember this story and ask yourself the following question: when the sun and the moon meet up, as occurs during an eclipse, does it mean the King, like the lion, pounced on the hunters and won or that, rather, the hunters, like the unicorn, skewered the King and that they won. Either way, and regardless, the fact there is an eclipse is proof-positive (say the ancient Chinese and medieval Europeans alike) that the Lion met up with the Unicorn, or vice versa, such that the Wild Hunt is not only real, but continues to this very day.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 10/12/07 20:17</span></i></p>

<i>Trapping, Slashing and Defending the Forest without Mercy PvM (1-40) and PvP</i><br><br>The WILD HUNTER (“Eternal Warden”)<br>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar<br><br>The Build:<br><br>Pros:<br>• 	• Very good/high AB, and Lethal Damage Output, thanks not only to dual-wielding/6 hits per round (make that 7 hasted), but also Bane which covers off all seven (7) player races, with pretty good stealth (for a str. based character) and decent trapping, too<br>• 	Devastating Critical – DC 40 (make that 46 with str. gear); having the ability to sneak up and dispose of an enemy in a single hit is rather nice (with dual wielding giving the potential for many crits, thus forcing more rolls from your enemy to save against insta-death)<br>• 	Pale Master Immunities (immune to: Criticals, Sneak, Paralysis, Stun and Hold) hence, he’s the one dev. critting, as opposed to being dev. critted, among other things, with good HPs (over 480), innate spell-casting, and also UMD<br>• 	This appears to be a unique build (the closest being Death Bane, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "251653", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> by Kail Pendragon, which shares the same class combo, and is a very nice build but, among other differences, does not have dev. crit); this build is the very first to combine Dev.Crit., PM immunities and epic ranger/bane, covering off all 7 player races (hence, nothing short of lethal damage).<br><br><br>Cons:<br>• 	Low/Mediocre saves (not really a problem though in terms of fort or reflex, in light of HPs and PM immunities, stealth, and damage, incl. traps; as to will save, however, you’ll want to shore up same with your umd training and/or clarity potions) <br>• 	Skills are a bit thin, and could be definitely be better, but are overall fairly decent<br>•	Playability Restrictions (i.e., check to see whether Dev.Crit is banned on your server).<br><br>Without any further ado, please meet:<br><br><br>The WILD HUNTER (“Eternal Warden”)<br>Ranger(26), Bard(4), Pale Master(10)<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Chaotic or Neutral Evil (Theme: Cursed, and Seeking Redemption)<br><br>I.

Thanks, Ithacan <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Yeah, warden looks to be a very nice build, too (self described as a PvM build by his author, but he has a nice defense/AC angle goin’ on him, which is nice); that said, you know me and my AB/offense factor (hence, all 7 player races accounted for, with +5 AB over warden, even more when you consider thst Hunter's buffs aren’t dispellable, plus optimized damage (overwhelming/massive criticals, bane vs. all, etc.), more HPs, a higher dev.crit DC, among other differences and, thanks to PM, his AC be decent enough; but, yeah, I readily admit that Hunter’s more of a “power build” – delaying for e.g, bard thus skills 'til epics, but we gets there right outta epic gate, and then some (so he's playable, then str-based rangers are from the get-go I find, and only made that much better/more fun when combined with bard for those wonderful skills like UMD, not to mention the RP-value—medieval hunters loved to blow on their horns of course, and who better to do so than a bard <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   ). <br><br>(that said, I know these kinda builds aren't your cup of tea per se, and hence, coming from you, that be a really nice compliment on Hunter, indeed: thanks so much for that, Ithacan, please know I appreciate it! <br><br>Happy Hunting! ~ Tyr <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 04/26/07 00:30</span></i></p>

Fair enough, you say it's a mix beteween Norse Religion and Celtic. That part is christianity though. Those who died in battle were either collected by the valkyries or, actually, gathered by Freya(Half of them) to serve her and not Odin. That said, Hel(Hela in English?), the Goddess of the Death Realm was brought the rest. Her Realm was not one of suffering or torment, and had nothing to do with good or evil.

Huh? re: AC -- this guy, fully buffed and dual-wielding, w. +5 items and haste, no shield or plate, is only 2 less than say a WM/FTR w. plate, tower, and haste enjoying (unlike him) only 4 apr (as opposed to his 7 apr w. haste, and, btw, yer avg. meelee'r w.o UMD or any monk in the mix, where they gonna get haste? not to mention that yer avg. melee'r ain't immune to crit, much less sneak or paralysis or .... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">        <br><br>That said, your point (for PvP) well taken, and of course, you are going to enjoy whatever armor/shield as may be necessary (hence, breastplate and/or other med. armor + tower, which ain't accounted for in the above mix) as Grim says, enjoy as necessary -- so true, so true ... (thanks, Grim, and well put, as usual <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">        <br><br>As to weapon, <br>that also depends: true, axes have less of a threat range than say shortswords, then again, they have a /x3 multiplier (as compared to SS's /x2 - meaning, even if someone should make their save vs. a DevCrit DC 40 (make that 46 str. buffed), well, they still take /x3 damage, and that damage incl. bane <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">         (of course, if you want to force more crits, even although at 6 apr (7 hasted) you really do force the issue, and being dev.crit immune yourself, well .... on the other hand, Grim's is also great thinking - ie, say, SS's (or, if you're going for med. armor, then, scimitar for the even wider crit. range, but no massive crit damage or dual-wielding if you go scimmy though -- as always, adj. to fit your own preferences/environs ... and if your environs permit keen axes, well then ... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">        <br><br>'nuff said on that... (thanks, Grim - as usual, great observations/variants, and def. by all means everyone, as Grim reminds us, adj. to your own environs, indeed! - then, Grim be the master of Norse Lore, so great points he makes, of course <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">        <br><br>As to the story, <br>thanks, Grim -- you know why I wrote it (congrats, so much again) -- ah, but as a Celt and Nordic/French/Anglo meself, you know, can't help but blend <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">         <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">        <br><br>But your point as always is well taken: religion is always a thorny issue, always; early Christians, and again today, be what they're "supposed" to be about -- as in, easing suffering and oppression for those currently "in life" (ah, certain institutions, took the whole "or you'll be tormented for eternity" etc." way from the initial focus -- indeed, as do all institutions w. power unfortunately, forget the meaning -- and why, I find anyway (and not a religious lesson, folks, honest; not my territory - I be an academic afterall, and fight for freedom from as much as freedom to; that said, history is alls I can say that we've so much in common as a human race, so much symbolism, and so much as a human people, it's hard, if you are a true christian that is (or true Jew, or Muslim, or Hindu, or ... ), to not respect all humanity, cause that's how it started - i.e., tolerance, afterall, not power (ah, and why all of humanity has so much in common, regardless of religion, past, present or future ... -- while I digress, I know, the story (and RP-factor) brings it on, yes? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">        <br><br>Norse and Celt, so interesting though, so many gods in common, and so much lore - unicorns, def. a Celt thing, may have been Greek, but China knew of them too (in fact, last sighting was as the history books say, by Marco Polo in Africa, apparently, the unicorn died out due to its horn being cut off, wasn't death to take the horn, cept that the unicorn w.o its horn could no longer defend itself vs. the lion, and well known by the Chinese); on the other hand, there's German (Norse) lore about Unicorns, too: as in, a unicorn showed up and saved an old women who was, contrary to the then wistch-hunters of the Church, practicing sorcery (pre-christian germany, and woman was a healer) -- anyway, the unicorn showed up and carried her off on its back; a couple centuries later, some scientist swore (even published) that he found unicorn bones in the said cave ... (so, once again: the moral in the tale, ie. innocent saving the innocent ... cool, huh <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>Unicorns were well respected in particular by the Celts, ie Scotland, and it was no mistake during the union of Britain (England and Scots) that the symbol chosen was a unicorn beside a lion -- together, it was said, they'd have a British Empire that would control the world (lion for Brits meant male, and unicorn meant female, and together, well .... er, British Empire conquered what was it, 3/4's of the world w. wooden boats -- egads, the Chinese def. knew what they were talking about (and so, too, then did the nobles of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales ... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">         <br> <br>Ah, but the French loved the unicorn, too -- so much in fact they had a very hard time justifying their hunting of them (yes, there were unsrupulous folks who, insisting that horns were a unicorn's and selling it to ie nobles who feared of course being poisoned and wld. pay dearly for the horn regardless) ... well, that's where christianity also played in: i.e., to see a unicorn meant by def'n back then that you were ie blessed; then, the beast existed long before any such christian lore, innocent and smart yes (why it became and still is a christian symbol), but also represented the goddess (i.e., the moon -- and hence, the symbolism itself, which spoke to the Celts .... incredible when you think about it, then, so, too, I must admit is this character (heh, gotta live up to the lore, yes (regardless how you dress/equip him == then again, that kinda goes for various religions, too - er, borrow from here, adjust from there (sorry, and once again I'm no expert on these things, I'm not, but I do know, when it comes to old beliefs vs. say the more nodern mono-theists, morality and humanity remain the same: it's a question thus of doing one's best as an individual -- although, that said, there is def. something to be said about Norse and Celt pre-Christian culture -- the gods and goddesses being far more human if you will (then, so too was the early christian notions of god, as in, an understanding god ... in other words, and lest we forget, about innocence, tolerance, and redemption -- and that, too, is what the unicorn represents, in many cultures (particularly that of the Celts, and yet, when it gets along w. the lion, well, watch out <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">         <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">        <br><br>And so, once again, thank you so much Grim -- as always, such a wonderful discussion; but as to Freya, in Norse, was she (as I understand it) not also the chief Valykrie if you will, and also the sister of Freyr, as in, the chief goddess/god of the elves, too? In Celtic lore, albeit a different name, she was the head goddess if you will, and travelled with cats (hence, on this build folks, for sure, take up the panther as your companion, not only does it build wise get you incredible stealth and sneak damage, but RP wise totally fits the build, too) -- indeed, she was a force to be reckoned w.

In Norwegian called "Avgud" and not "Gud". Not sure what the English word is. She was not a Valkyrie, as they were in Odins service. She travelled in a chariot pulled by two cats, that is correct. What exactly their domains was is not so easy to get, but she was Goddess of love, sexual lust and pleasure, wisdom, also something in warfare probably a bunch other influences. The first mentioned the biggest ones. Her brother was protector of the Elves (there is very little about them preserved today) and God of Fertility. So together they make much sense. As a sidetrack, Thor was also God of Fertility, but that is with regards to crops, woods etc.<br><br>[/history- and religion lesson]<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again
