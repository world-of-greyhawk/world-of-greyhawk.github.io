The goal of this build was to have a Great Smiter that had Listen and Spot as class skills and could survive on the front lines. The down side is it might be hard to play before level 9, as it has low DEX and only light armor at that point making it hard to get a decent AC. It also does not have as good of AB as most fighter types due to its low STR. On the plus side it eventually has Great Smite 6, heavy armor, Evasion, martial weapons, a decent Sneak Attack, an Epic Vrock, good saves, high Divine Shield and Divine Might stats, and a good undead turning check. I suggest using a full plate and large shield with this as a tower shield would have too great of an impact on Tumble.<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Any Evil<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 14<br>Dex 12<br>Con 14<br>Wis 10<br>Int 10<br>Cha 16<br><br>Leveling<br><br>1 Rogue 1 - Power Attack, Cleave<br>2 Rogue 2 - <br>3 Rogue 3 - Blind Fight<br>4 Rogue 4 - CHA +1<br>5 Rogue 5 - <br>6 Rogue 6 - Knockdown<br>7 Fighter 1 - Weapon Focus Longsword<br>8 Fighter 2 - Great Cleave, CHA +1<br>9 Blackguard 1 - Toughness<br>10 Blackguard 2 - <br>11 Blackguard 3 - <br>12 Blackguard 4 - Divine Shield, CHA +1<br>13 Blackguard 5 - <br>14 Blackguard 6 - <br>15 Blackguard 7 - Divine Might<br>16 Blackguard 8 - CHA +1<br>17 Rogue 7 -<br>18 Blackguard 9 - Extra Smiting<br>19 Rogue 8 -<br>20 Blackguard 10 - CHA +1<br>21 Rogue 9 - Great Charisma<br>22 Blackguard 11 - <br>23 Blackguard 12 - <br>24 Blackguard 13 - Great Charisma, Epic Prowess, CHA +1<br>25 Blackguard 14 - <br>26 Blackguard 15 - <br>27 Blackguard 16 - Great Charisma, Epic Weapon Focus Longsword<br>28 Blackguard 17 - CHA +11<br>29 Blackguard 18 - <br>30 Blackguard 19 - Great Smite I, Epic Fiendish Servant, <br>31 Blackguard 20 - <br>32 Blackguard 21 - STR +1<br>33 Blackguard 22 - Great Smite II, Great Smite III<br>34 Blackguard 23 - <br>35 Blackguard 24 - <br>36 Blackguard 25 - Great Smite IV, Great Smite V, STR +1<br>37 Blackguard 26 - <br>38 Blackguard 27 - <br>39 Blackguard 28 - Great Strength, Great Smite VI<br>40 Rogue 10 - Crippling Strike, STR +1<br><br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 18<br>Dex 12<br>Con 14<br>Wis 10<br>Int 10<br>Cha 26<br><br>Skills:<br>Concentration: 42<br>Discipline: 42<br>Hide: 5<br>Listen: 42<br>Spot: 41<br>Tumble: 35<br><br>Put 4 points in Hide at level 1, and one at level 2.

Nice idea, but you have quite a few errors in your template.  You have more than 10 levels of a PrC pre-epic.  Can't do it.  There's also a few places where you have feats at levels where you can't take a feat.<br><br>Great Smite builds are great, unfortunately this character goes to extreme lengths to get a powerful Great Smite and yet can only use it against Good opponents.  In the meantime, his AB suffers atrocious losses, as there is no WF, EWF or Prowess in the build.  Further, you end with a 15 Str?<br><br>End Tumble at 40 ranks<br><br>Lots to fix here.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 08/17/06 11:14</span></i></p>

Darn it, sorry about the errors. Something must have gotten lost in the translation from my spreadsheet calculator thing. Should have proof-read better. I also meant to build the character from the sheet before posting. I built it a long time ago, and was trying to recreate the history on a spreadsheet. I ended with 15 STR because adding that last point to something else would have resulted in an odd score as well, and STR at least adds to the weight you can carry. I will consider trying to fit WF, Prowess, and EWF in somewhere as well. Admittedly this character's greatest strength is only applicable in a limited fashion. Not very versatile. At least it has turning and sneaks. Come to think of it, probably not a good PvP build at all, even though I've never done PvP. I will fix the problems first thing tomorrow.

Fix up the build and pm the edits to a moderator. That said, you use to much CHA here, at least stop when you reach 26, and try to get a higher AB, give up some smiting, eh. <br><br>Weird level-split too.

The extra three Rogue levels were for Improved Evasion. Maybe not a good investment with such high saves. Weapon Specialization might be a nice addition. Great idea about lowering CHA. I wish I thought of that.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By whirlin_merlin on 08/17/06 19:08</span></i></p>

Great Cleave because...?  I'd much rather get Improved Critical, since crits have great synergy with smites and a smiter can actually make good use of a large threat range...and because Great Cleave sucks unless you're getting Dev Crit.<br><br>I think it would be better to drop 2 or 4 BG levels for Fighter to get EWS, but that's just me.
