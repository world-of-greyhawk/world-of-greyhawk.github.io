is it possible to make a character with these 3 classes?<br><br>or bard/wm/bg?<br><br>if possible 10+levels of sd and decent amount of bard levels withthings like curse song and possibly LI. checked nwn wiki and only alignment restriction on any of the classes is bard. <br><br>justwondering....<br>_________________<br>Where we belong, there's no one to hurt.

It's possible, but feats would be tight with the prereqs for WM. Also with 10 SD levels and 7 WM levels which you need to make WM worth it, you would be two levels shy of undispellable Bard spells.

yeah, i tried pulse caps, odd enough not all the builds are findable through it. <br><br>must have missed coreyb's build...<br><br>i msged coreyb about his bard/sd/bg, was thinking of going more sd than bg since the server i play on has a penalty for hide and ms for sd until you put in more sd levels....<br>_________________<br>Where we belong, there's no one to hurt.

You could try Bard 23/SD 10/WM 7 getting Epic Dodge, Curse Song and LI but you'll be feat starved (no room for Blind Fight or KD!): 39 AB, 32 AC (no buffs, mundane equipment), 368 HPs, 4apr.

that does sound good. the server i play on has that penalty to hide/ms. you get negatives on the two skills untill you hit level 10 on sd. so thinking if anything only 10 sd would be needed. 23 bard levels not exactly dispell proof but at least high enough for some long term buffs, and i'm guessing aslong as 4 of the 7 wm levels are pre-epic i'd make the 4 attacks per round mark<br><br>(btw, love your sig kail. mines off a metal song)<br>_________________<br>Where we belong, there's no one to hurt.

built looks pretty good, think i'll try it next. your right, does seem feat starve so nothing cool like kd or even improved crit. so what type of weapon to use? didn't notice any crit feats so maybe longsword or battleaxe?<br><br>-Correction, just noticed that the 3 classes will only give me simple weapons, so maybe morningstar or sickle....-<br><br>and the song is from a band called "NothingFace"- "Ether".<br>_________________<br>Where we belong, there's no one to hurt.

Sickle or Mace being that you need both a simple and a finessable weapon. The mace gives you blunt dmg but the sickle is keenable. You could give up EP for IC (and rearrange feats a little to get it sooner).<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die
