Well here goes, my first post in the epic build section.  Please forgive me if I don't list all of the possible stats, I'll edit the post later on and fill in any info I missed.  I've build this character up using the Character Builder downloaded from the nwn vault.  (btw:  the author of that spreadsheet sure did some mighty fine work.  gold star for him/her)<br><br><br>Here is the character:  A Palemaster Barbarian that has dev crit, terrifying rage, thunderign rage, 5/- damage reduction, improved knockdown, crit/sneak immunity, stun/hold/paralize immunity, and a bit of epic fire resistance to boot.

Nice build! One doesn't see enough Undead Barbarians at the local Starbucks anymore...<br><br><br>Do you need 24 levels of Barb? If you could drop some, you could boost PM to 16 and take some Epic Spells.<br><br>And I like the idea of a late Bard level to boost Bardic skills... but those ideas would change your build to Barb 20/Bard 4/PM 16. <br><br>Nice job!<br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br>What I'm reading now:<br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0874779405/103-5804382-8859066?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance" target="_blank">The White Spider</a> by Heinrich Harrer.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kaliban99 on 10/07/05 20:32</span></i></p>

I'm definitely a fan of the Barb/bard/PM, especially on dev crit servers.  I do wholeheartedly agree however, that you should bump PM up to 16 in favor of the barb levels, and I would also try to take a last bard lvl a little later for the skill dump.

This build gets to few skill points. No way to work in a Great STR feat epic, instead of f.ex. epic energy resistance. Your tumble is 25, it should be 40 (with 4 bard), and Barbarian has Taunt as a skill, which is mighty useful. You are in for a serious rearranging of levels, tho. Other than that a very good build, welcome to the build forum. We hope to see more. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

I didn't go with 16 PM levels because I wanted a bit more DR from the Barb lvl 23.<br><br>I chose Epic Fire Resistance because everybody flames their weapons, and having 2 Epic Fire Resistances will nullify that damage.<br><br>I didn't go with Taunt because I wanted to max Intimidate.<br><br>I don't know if the lack of Epic spells will nerf this build on a PvP server.

Here's what I'd suggest:<br><br>If you're going to keep the levels you have in the build, then spread your Bard out a bit. Take them at levels 22, 32, and 37. That will give you the chance to top Tumble at regular intervals and get a 40 Tumble for the full +8 to AC.<br><br>Speaking of skills: start with 8 DEX and 14 INT. This will net you 43 more skill points (total of 232 points). Invest this way:<br><br>Discipline: 40 (49)<br>Tumble: 40<br>Intimidate: 43 (55)<br>Spellcraft: 38 (40)<br>Taunt: 43 (41)<br>Perform: 11 (9)<br>UMD: 17 (15)<br><br>This nets you (over your current configuration): <br><br>+1 to your saves vs spells<br>+3 Dodge AC (from Tumble)<br>Taunt to lower your opponent's AC by up to 6<br>Only slightly less UMD (it works on values of 5, so you're really only dropping 1 'check ranking' from what you had)<br>Slightly better Intimidate.<br>-1 on your overall Reflex saves (but it's made up for vs spells with the extra Spellcraft).<br><br>*edit* I'd also suggest switching the position of Knockdown and Great Cleave. I think you'll find (from a playability standpoint) that the KD feat will be of more use early on than the Great Cleave feat.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 10/08/05 16:33</span></i></p>
