However, since you're only shifting between Lawful Good and Lawful Neutral, it should be doable, as it seems like most mods I have played have some way to shift towards Good or Evil)<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting:<br><br>Str 14 <br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 14<br>Wis 14<br>Cha 14<br><br>Put 2 point into Int<br>Put 8 points into Str<br><br>Ending:<br><br>Str 26 <br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 18 <br>Wis 14<br>Cha 14<br><br>Feats<br><br>1 Power Attack, Cleave<br>3 Weapon Focus<br>6 Still Spell<br>9 Great Cleave<br>12 Blind-Fight <br>15 Knockdown   <br>18 Toughness   <br>21 Epic Weapon Focus, Great Int I *<br>24 Great Str I,  <br>27 Great Str II, Great Int II *<br>30 Great Str III<br>33 Great Str IV, Craft Wand *<br>36 Overwhelming Crit<br>39 Dev Crit<br><br>* Wizard bonus feat<br><br>Note: This is a melee version of the build.  If you want to play the build as a caster, consider adding in the Spell Focus or Spell Penetration feats. <br><br>Feats you could lose without hurting the build too much would include Blind-Fight, Toughness, and Craft Wand.   <br><br><br>Skills<br><br>Concentration: 43<br>Discipline:    43<br>Healing:       43<br>Lore:          43<br>SpellCraft:    43<br>Tumble:        21 <br><br>Total: ~260 (3 left over)<br><br>Note: If you wanted to, you could put points into Hide and Move Silently when you are taking PM levels.  <br><br>However, due to the fact that this is a Str-based character who wears heavy armor, and has no way of getting sneak attacks, I figured those points were probably better spent on other things. <br><br> <br>Epic Level Progression<br><br>21    Wizard<br>22    PM<br>23-30 Wizard<br>31    Paladin<br>32-33 Wizard<br>34    Paladin<br>35-39 PM<br>40    Paladin<br><br>HP: 420 max unbuffed (assumes +30 from Deathless Vigor)<br><br>AB: <br><br>26 base<br>+8 Str<br>+1 WF<br>+2 Epic WF<br>__________<br>37 w/ mundane Scimitar<br><br>AC:<br><br>10 base <br>-1 Dex<br>+8 Full Plate<br>+3 Tower Shield<br>+4 Tumble<br>+6 Bone Skin<br>_____________<br>30 AC w/ heavy armor<br><br><br>NEXT<br><br>Ancient Avenger<br><br>Paladin 20/Wizard 10/PM 10<br>(pre-epic Paladin 12/Wizard 4/PM 4)<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting:<br><br>Str 10 <br>Dex 15<br>Con 14<br>Int 14<br>Wis 14<br>Cha 10<br><br>Put 2 point into Int<br>Put 8 points into Dex<br><br>Ending:<br><br>Str 10 <br>Dex 28<br>Con 14<br>Int 18 <br>Wis 14<br>Cha 10<br><br>Feats<br><br>1 TWF, Ambidexterity<br>3 Weapon Focus: Shortsword<br>6 Toughness<br>9 Craft Wand<br>12 Blind-Fight<br>15 Knockdown<br>18 ITWF<br>21 Epic Weapon Focus, Great Int I *<br>24 Great Dex I<br>27 Great Dex II, Great Int II *<br>30 Great Dex III<br>33 Great Dex IV<br>36 Great Dex V <br>39 Epic Prowess<br><br>* Wizard bonus feat<br><br><br>AB: <br><br>26 base<br>+9 Dex<br>+1 WF<br>+1 Epic Prowess<br>+2 Epic WF<br>-2 Dual-wield<br>_____________<br>37 AB w/ mundane Shortswords<br><br>AC: <br><br>10 base <br>+9 Dex<br>+4 Tumble<br>+6 Bone Skin<br>_____________<br>29 naked AC<br><br><br>This is the Dex-based version of the build.  Note that it takes 20 Paladin levels rather than 15 so that it can cast Holy Sword on two weapons.  He still gets 8th lvl spells, although his caster level is lower.  <br><br>Also, since he doesn't wear any armor, putting points into Hide and Move Silently is much more viable with this version.
