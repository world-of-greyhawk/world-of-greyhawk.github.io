Nice concept. One thing you missed was Rapid Shot, which requires 13+ Dexterity. So take another point of CHA. You can trade it for Still Spell.

Ah yes- totally forgot one of the most important feats- thanks!<br><br>Also- can't do halberd b/c druid - so maybe a magical spear when surrounded; as well as offensive magic (high concentr)<br><br>please give me further feedback (i know this build is kind of 'out there'!)

One thing you may want to look into is focusing more on one facet of your design over another. You have only 9 AA levels so it really isn't taking advantage of the class. The main advantage is at high levels where the automatic enhancement bonus is at +10 or higher. The other thing is you can't shoot a bow while shapeshifted, and your seem to point out druid forms a few times. Not to say having infinte elemental shape is a waste, because I am a fan of doing it with monk multiclassed myself.<br><br>For pvm I am sure this will work great. For pvp you may want to look into being a bit more focused on archery or druid. (personally I'd add to archery to get insane AB). The other benefit of this would be a lot more feats from taking AA into epic levels. Maybe try a level split with 14 Druid/3 Wiz/23 AA. You can still pick up dragon shape and use same stats, but your AB will be much higher. You will also be able to buff approximately as well as your current build does. Obviously you lose some higher level spells, but the tradeoff may be worth it.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Why take the fourth Great Wisdom? You end up with 31 Wis from what I can see. All those odd point stats equal waste.<br><br>I can't see the point of 3 Wizard levels. If you want AA taking some Bard makes more sense, due to getting Tumble. And 3 Wiz levels so early takes 2 BAB away.<br><br>I don't get the feeling that you have any particular reason for taking 28 levels in Druid, 9 in AA and 3 in Wizard, except that they add up to 40.<br><br>Another problem of this mix is that the AC is awful compared to Druid/Monk builds or any Dex based AA. It's hard not to come to the conclusion that this is just not a happy mix...

Even better if you can live without the 2nd level wiz spells would be to up the AA levels to 25 for another bonus feat, and only take the one wis level.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>
