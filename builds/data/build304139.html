I've recently come up with the same as here idea of creating a Mystic Theurge,<br>however I have accomplished that task in quite a different manner. The main goal is to create a character that has got an access to every clerical and mystic spell, trying to lose as little as possible from its arcane power. So here it goes:<br><br>Mystic Theurge, Human, 17 Cleric/23 Wizard, Lawful Neutral,<br><br>Wizardry: General school<br>Clerical domains: Healing/Magic or Knowledge/Magic (RP! Mystran or Oghman priest)<br><br>STR: 8<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 14<br>INT: 18 (26) [27]<br>WIS: 15 (20) [20]<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Different final abilities noted in parentheses - some worlds have plenty of items giving immunity: mind-affecting, so it's either spell focus - greater spell focus - epic spell focus: enchantment OR Toughness - Great Intelligence - Epic spell: Greater ruin<br><br>Leveling:<br>1: WIZ: Extend spell, Spell focus: Evocation<br>2: WIZ:<br>3: WIZ: Greater spell focus: Evocation<br>4: WIZ: INT+1<br>5: WIZ: Spell focus: Necromancy<br>6: WIZ: Greater spell focus: Necromancy<br>7: WIZ:<br>8: WIZ: INT+1<br>9: WIZ: Spell penetration<br>10: WIZ: Greater spell penetration<br>11: WIZ:<br>12: WIZ: INT +1; Maximize spell<br>13: WIZ:<br>14: WIZ:<br>15: CLE: Still spell<br>16: CLE: WIS +1<br>17: CLE: <br>18: CLE: Spell focus: Enchantment (Toughness)<br>19: CLE:<br>20: CLE: WIS +1<br>21: CLE: Epic spell penetration<br>22: WIZ: Greater spell focus: Enchantment (Great Intelligence I)<br>23: WIZ: <br>24: WIZ: INT +1; Epic spell focus: Evocation<br>25: CLE: <br>26: CLE: <br>27: WIZ: Epic spell focus: Necromancy<br>28: WIZ: INT +1<br>29: WIZ: Epic spell focus: Enchantment (Great Intelligence II)<br>30: WIZ: Epic spell: Epic mage armour<br>31: CLE:<br>32: CLE: WIS +1<br>33: WIZ: Epic spell: Epic warding<br>34: WIZ: Great Intelligence I (Epic spell: Greater ruin)<br>35: CLE:<br>36: CLE: WIS +1; Great Intelligence II (Great Intelligence III)<br>37: CLE:<br>38: CLE:<br>39: CLE: Great Intelligence III (Great Intelligence IV)<br>40: CLE: WIS +1<br><br>HP: 17 x 10 + 6 x 23 = 308 (348)<br>BAB/AB : Who cares?<br><br>AC with plate armour/tower shield and combo Undeath's eternal foe, Aura versus alignment, shadow shield, max cat's grace, shield, epic mage armour, shield of faith, mage armour, magic vestment, haste: 57 (yeah, some of these buffs don't stack)<br><br>Skillpoints: Concentration = Heal = Lore = Spellcraft = 43, Tumble = Discipline = Spot = Listen = 21, Search = 7<br><br>Saving throws (unbuffed, naked):<br>Fortitude: 21<br>Reflex: 15<br>Will: 29<br><br>Arcane DC (9th circle spell from any of the following schools: Enchantment, Necromancy, Evocation): 33<br>Divine DC (9th circle spell from any of the following schools: Enchantment, Necromancy, Evocation): 30  (Implosion - 33)<br><br>NOTES:<br><br>0. In order to bump up DC of spells using fortitude/reflex/will throws the epic focuses in necromancy/evocation/enchantment have been taken. <br>1. Very wide repertoire and a great number of spells!<br>2. DC is fair, as for a spellcaster. However it should suffice in most cases, as most builds have got at least one certain weakness concerning throws. (See 0.)<br>3. Epic spell penetration is necessary due to relatively low both levels of caster classes.<br>4. That character should usually wear some mage robes, although upon facing a melee he may put on an armour and a shield setting all his wizzy spells to stilled mode.<br>5. Combo Death armour/Elemental shield/Mestil's acid sheath/Holy aura/Unholy aura seems to be quite a nice one.<br>6. Plenty of buffs!<br>7. RP, babe!<br>8. Epic spell focus in Enchantment might be useless as many worlds are filled with items that give immunity to mind-affecting spells. In such case, these 3 feats should be devoted to toughness - great intelligence - Greater Ruin.<br><br>I'd appreciate any comments on what could be done better keeping in mind the goal of this build.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 03/21/09 17:54</span></i></p>

I'm ok with this posting as I think it is different enough in some areas to warrant it. I would suggest if one of the two builds inspired your creation, do give that other builder credit for being your muse.<br><br>Also as Onion said, if you are saying your build is different, give some examples of why it is different so that those who are reading it can focus on the differences and see where you are coming from.<br><br>Thank you for posting.<br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.

The idea of both builds is the same, however the main difference is the balance between two classes - my build is more arcane oriented (compare starting and final abilities) - equal divine dc, better arcane one.

LOL!  Sorry bout that.  I made the reference ONLY to point out that i dont play wizards, and my experience with DC is rather skewed (read above).  I really had no idea that a dc of 34 or 38 is considered high.

His DC isn't great in a non-PRC context, but it's not "bad." He's dispellable, but if he gets mord's off first, it won't matter, because the other guy will be getting ready to run. And let's be honest, if I'm a mage in a PvP contest with another mage, I'm not calculating dispel numbers in my head. I'm hitting the mord's on my quickbar.<br><br>But I'm not sold on the build, because I really think that you should just concede lvl 9 cleric spells and stop at cleric 11 and be undispellable on the mage side (29/11). Then you have a cleric that can cast heal (or harm) still and his DCs are at least then into the above-average range with all the foci. I'd also agree that you should probably only go foci in the schools you plan on employing regularly. And empower spell would be nice for your attack spells. I think this build would be terribly painful through the mid-level range, going 29/11 would mitigate that some as well. But then it's not your concept, I know.<br><br>I do like it better than the original Mystic Theurge, but then, I wasn't crazy about that either. Really, for this concept to work, you need the PRC class. *shrugs* But neither Bio nor Obsidian could ever get around to doing it.

The Empower spell helps though with dmg output on spells you intend to use throughout your career. I'd trade the 1 (currently) pt there for the greater optimal dmg. In the long term, the trade off is in your favor.

YOUR idea is to leave yourself short of offense going into lv 20range.  By deciding to take cleric in pre, you leave your char without mass offense like Wail, among others.

You may think they are less so cuz of lv 17 vs 23, i assure you they are not.  A cleric, in the early levels is VERY easy to level, vs a wizard, regardless of the end game focus.  My comment, like i said, was in terms of leveling playability.  Going into epic with lv 9 divine spells IS a very nice way to play.  Lv 8 and lv9 (arc or div) spells are a necessity, imo, for this character in the mid lvl range.  YOu have omittted BOTH styles. <br><br>in the end, its your build. NOthing i could say will change your mind, despite the logic or heresy!  You can try to pick apart what i say all day.  In the end, its opinion.

People, ease up on the guy a bit. Yeah, the combo's been done, but to me it looks sufficiently different to warrant posting (the other two stop at low INT and WIS, while this build doesn't. There are also some feat differences as well as the way it's levelled).<br><br>Overall, for what he's stating he wants to accomplish (getting access to all the arcane and divine spells while losing as little as possible on the WIZ spells), I think he does quite well. While dispelling may be a concern, with 23 WIZ levels, it's by no means a guarantee (only a 10% chance). I think, depending on the environment, this could be quite an effective character. Tough one to level though, and the low stats in STR and DEX will pose a real problem in the first few levels.<br><br>I might be tempted to go with a few CLC levels first, then jump to WIZ. This allows you to get the Cleric buffs (and once you get access to Divine Power, you're good to go in melee).<br><br>ksipsi: generally, it's a good idea to provide links to similar builds in your build post as it makes it easier to compare and contrast.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Not to mention if you didn't prepare Stilled spells in advance then you can't use them and if you stilled them without using armor you're wasting slots. All around, you need to pick one style, armor or no armor, the part where you're going to change it according to the circumstances is harder than it sounds.

An unprepared wizard, if asaulted, would rather use such a strategy: greater sanctuary/invisibility - pulling back - adjusting his gear - adjusting his spells - retaliation.

But in such cases one usually has got some support from other companions so that problem should be tackled using proper tactics.

Oh, one more thing. In case of a high magic server (=most cases), where the only benefit of taking Epic Armour is +5 to dodge ac one should forfeit that spell substituting it with mage armour + shadow conjuration: mage armour casted at least 5 times and taking Great intelligence V instead (Thus achieving 34 dc in arcane!)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ksipsi on 12/13/08 17:16</span></i></p>

Creeping Doom is kinda nice, but I see this build has quite a lot of spellpower already, I'd throw a Wail of Banshee or a Finger of Death before trying Creeping Doom, I agree with ksipsi, Plant isn't for this build.<br><br>23 levels of Wizard gives you more than half the stuff you usually try to get with Domains, so any Domain you pick it seems like you've got those spells already with your Wizard, that's why Plant could come to mind, it gives Druid stuff you don't have, but you've got to like Creeping Doom to take it. I think Healing is not a bad choice, it never is, Heal at level 5 is a good way to use low level slots where your offensive spells are not really so strong, but any Domain would do, all of them will add very little.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

There are plenty of low to mid magic action servers. That is also where a build like this has a greater advantage.

Just so im clear on this... new player builds a version of cleric/wiz for all the world to see.  some of the best builders in the guild give some of their insight into how to make the build better... new player, in all his knowledge, argues his points to death... hmm<br><br>You do realize that the air/magic domain comment is valid, right?  IF, and it seems a big IF, you are going to use armor, you really need autostill 3.  Sure, you can do it with still, but then you loose lv 9 spells in wiz, which are some very important killing machines (wail and max igms, to name 2).  But who knows, maybe your idea of striping down just before every battle is valid.  After all, we all have crytstal balls and we always know exactly when it is time to get into a combat (which, if you arent aware, CAN mean (and it may be server dependant, hence CAN) that once you have taken the armor off, you cant put anything else in that slot uptil after combat).  I guess you are giving the diablo 2 term "Naked maging" a whole new meaning (or the exact meaning they meant).<br><br>You should really listen to Kail, grizz, onion and Thax.  I am fairly certain they do know what they are talking about.  Infact, i have played some of their builds myself WITHOUT tweak, cuz they is that GOOD!<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/28/06 00:22:49 (GMT) -- TyrTemplar<br><br>This post is for general information purposes only, and does not constitute a legal opinion or render any legal advice.

You stubbornly try to defend your false statements from the first post throughout the whole thread - after you compromised yourself and exposed incompetence with comments on dc you persisted to argue that 34 is still very low and used every faint opportunity to depreciate that build. Zery gut. Till now, don't write any posts that require my answer.
