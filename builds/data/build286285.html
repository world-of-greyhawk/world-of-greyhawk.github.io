Since the OP hasn't stated it, the total sneak attack for this build is +17d6 with crippling strike.

I like this particular combination of classes.  High sneak damage is always nice, especially when combined with HiPs.<br><br>I would, however, make a few changes.  First off, the starting stats.  Everything looks good there, except that I'd drop 1 point from Str to add to Cha.  That way, you can take Divine Shield.  Ideally, if you can get your Cha fully buffed (not sure how feasible that is on your server) you can get +7ac.  That would help out immensely in a build with Epic Dodge.<br><br>Second, I would drop the Epic Fiendish Servant bonus feat entirely, and move epic weapon focus to that bonus feat (or one much earlier).  With that, you've just freed up room for Divine Shield.  By removing the Improved Sneak Attack feat (does 1d6 more really make a difference?) you could feasibly add 1 more Cha for more Divine Shield AC (and duration) and improved saves, or even take Divine Might, if you're worried about damage output.<br><br>Other than that, nice work.

I have a simple suggestion: take Rogue to 20 and Blackguard to 19.  You don't do anything with the Blackguard bonus feat anyway (well, the sneak attack feat, but taking Rogue to 19 is the same, so it's like a bonus feat, like ESF: M/S or Hide).  <br><br>I'd allocate starting stats a bit differently, too. I'd go Str 14 and Cha 14 (leaving Dex at 16). You are a Blackguard, so that Charisma is doubly useful (tripl-y so with Divine Shield).  All saves go up one, your AC goes up one on Divine Shield, and you Divine Shield lasts one round longer.<br><br>That, plus what Hiwatt said.  But build to taste, and certainly, built to your PW.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Ithacan<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Ithacan on 11/24/07 17:34</span></i></p>
