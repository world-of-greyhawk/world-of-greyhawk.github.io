The default script is uncapped, although the documentation says otherwise.  If the spell is uncapped, then 24 levels of cleric would make you undispellable by greater dispel and lesser dispel, a full mage would always be able to use MD against you.  Also a paladin with a holy avenger will always be able to dispel you on hit with a fixed 25% chance.  The holy avenger property is hard coded.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Greater dispels cap has been upped to +20 while for my knowledge the buffs Mordenkainen's disjunction strips are mostly mage spells and only a few of a clerics major buffs are gone, correct me if im wrong there. Greater dispel was my biggest threat you see so can anyone clarify the Mordenkainen's disjunction?

Mordenkainen Disjunction, regarding to the dispel effect (not the breach one) basically behaves as an uncapped dispel, no matter whether your buufs are arcane or divine. Check it out on NWNWiki <a href="http://www.nwnwiki.org/Mordenkainen%27s_disjunction" target="_blank">here</a> and read carefully the notes on that page.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?

I believe it is beat the DC.  In which case a cleric level of 29 would likely be enough to render you immune to the improved greater dispel. I suggest a Cleric 30/Fighter 4/Monk 6, monk gets you evasion, tumble as a class skill and the knockdown feats, Fighter gives you epic weapon specialization and weapon specialization. As long as you are a human and keep the Fighter and Monk levels within one of each other until taking the last Monk level at 40 you can avoid an XP penalty.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
