Thanks Highlander.. I should know better by now as well!<br><br>Nice catch anyway.<br><br>Another edit needed please with regard to the alignment change being required on 12th level, not as 11th as I stated in the intro.

I like it, especially since I am revisiting my excessively lame Bard build to make it better. Mine probably won't look anything like this, but it's good to get ideas for common traits like the combat ability and spellcasting stuff. The alignment shift from CE to CN is entertaining.<br><br>Angel of Redemption: "I am EVIL!!!! I am the Archangel of death and destruction! I am the personification of evil! Oh, wait. Torm? Well, OK. I can take it or leave it then."<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>Just kidding. If you're going to change alignments it should be the shortest path possible, and Good/Evil is generally more shifty in mods than Law/Chaos.

This is nice, and I like the subtlety that goes unheralded in the build.  Namely, what is the drawback of the Bard class? Weapon choices.  What fulfills that need?  Blackguard.  What is the drawback of CoT?  No heavy armor.  Again resolved by Blackguard.<br><br>Good synergy here that goes beyond Charisma.  And one alignment change is gives him depth.  Well done.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Well spotted Grizz, I had been wondering if that would be flagged or not. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>I have been looking at the saves a bit more in depth and come up with some more interesting reading:<br><br><b>Save Calculation (VS.
