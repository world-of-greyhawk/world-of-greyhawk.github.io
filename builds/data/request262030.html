You could try something like, 23 Ranger 13 WM 4 monk.  Or, replacing the 6 WM levels past 7(which is almost favorable, as you only gain 1 AB and 1 feat) for 3 or 4 ranger and 6th or 7th monk might be desired(the 7th monk level in order to net you IKD sooner).<br><br>Good damage, nice criticals, and around 58 AB vs. favored enemies on the latter (I tested around with that one).  And with 6 favored enemies, you'll have plenty for the PW you play on <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

I'd say you'll get 46-48 AB vs favored enemies which becomes 44-46 with the dual sword. <br><br>IMO Ranger/FTR/Rogue would be a better choice.

Sorry, that was supposed to be 56 AB.  And also, I forgot to mention the mundane unbuffed AB - the 56 was with +6 from strength and a +5 weapon.

AFAIK, favored enemy does not add to AB - Just damage, spot, listen etc vs favored enemy. However, bane of enemies gives +2 AB and 2d6 damage vs favored enemies, if you have that than it is probabaly where the extra AB is coming from.

Besides, it's a common misconcept that FE adds to AB. BoE is the only Ranger feature adding to AB (+2 AB and +2d6 dmg), FE adds +1 to damage and to Listen, Spot and Taunt per each 5 lvls in the class (vs FEs only, of course).<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!

Hmm, I like the sound of the 26 ranger/7 WM/7 monk build. To get the best AB you would have to take all the monk levels after 20 right? Would this lose you anything you'd normally gain from being a monk? Sorry, not too good at this epic building stuff <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
