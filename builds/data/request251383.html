Alright. I know that what I am about to request, will not be the best of the Dragonshaper builds, but it is unique and has amazing Roleplay opportunities, as well as some cool combat functions. Playability is not a factor at all, and it would be meant more so for PvP than PvM. <br><br>The world it shall be born into is Low-Magic Item based, and nothing aside from an Arcane Archer, or fellow Dragon could beat its 40/+6 Damage Reduction. Armours and Weapons are capped at +4 and Haste and True Sight are not on any items. Immunities are not to be found aside from normal spells and class abilities; no items. <br><br>So, essentially what I want, is a Druid/Blackgaurd/Barbarian. Blackgaurd is for that twisted element of Evil, and the Sneak Attacks, while Barbarian is for terrifying rage and small speed boost. Uncanny doesn't hurt either. Druid is, of course, for Dragonshape. No more than 14 Druid levels are needed... I don't need Spell Power, I just need the Dragon. Blackgaurd doesn't really need any more levels than are required for Divine Might/Shield which would take 4 levels I guess. So that leaves 22 levels for Barbarian, though not that much is needed, I don't think.<br><br>The thing that makes this hard is that I need to spread my stats so thin. Since playability isn't an issue though, I don't need Con or Dex. But Wisdom is obvious, Charisma as well for the Divine Line, and Strength for Cleave. I guess there is no way for me to get 13 Intelligence though, for the IKD and ID feats.<br><br>I know this is a hard request to fulfill, but GAH! Think of the Dragon with terrifying rage, and a heart of pure EVIL!

You know what... I realize something.<br><br>The reason I take Blackgaurd is entirely for RP reasons! So what then, is the purpose of taking the Divine Might and Divine Shield feats? At best... with some server-found gear, I will get +7 AC and +7 Damage for only 7 rounds. Why do that, when I could ignore Charisma and take Intelligence, getting the extra Skill Points which are surprisingly useful for the Barbarian, and also take the KD/IKD line, and perhaps find room for the Disarm line as well.<br><br>Bleh. Blackgaurd will not be overly helpful to the build aside from the Sneak Attacks and stacking Bulls Strength, but with 40/+6 DR, over +55AB, Terrifying Rage, and the other obvious Dragon Strengths... I can sacrifice taking Monk and take Blackgaurd instead. Who needs another 10-20 Wisdom based AC, when you have Damage Reduction that cannot be passed on my server?<br><br>Well... I've shot down my own request here, so if a moderator wants to delete this go ahead. Unless of course, there is someone who still wants to post something on this.

Keep present that Divine Shield is useless in Dragon Shape, your Dodge AC is already capped. Divine Mighgt won't be that effective either since your CHA will not be high. <br><br>Monk doesn't just bring extra AC but also extra attacks, cleave, evasion better AB progression plus deflect arrows, speed, KD/IKD if going for more lvls. The extra AC makes a difference, cause it could easily make you immune to crits which can bypass your natural DR. Besides it's natural AC and it's not lost when flatfooted.<br><br>I'd go either Druid/Barb/Monk either Druid/BG/Monk: beware of the alignment requirements though.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Wait for me Dragon, we'll meet in the sky<br>By fire and magic, I'm sworn<br>Hell is calling, we cannot be denied<br>Fly to the blackness of the Storm<br><br>We must die to be reborn!

Yeah, that was the problem.<br><br>And I forgot about the Dragons Dodge AC already being at +20...<br><br>But terrifying rage is soo cool, and Blackgaurd is such an iconic evil thing.<br><br>I want Monk though! That stupid Powergame instict requires it of me!
