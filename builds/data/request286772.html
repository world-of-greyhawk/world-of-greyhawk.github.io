Thank you.. but I go to an RP server and it would be awfully inappropriate for him to be a ranger, how he'll have to be pressured to protect forests and be an animal lover and all that stuff <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>As well, I forgot to mention that the build to have some fighting ability to get to level 40 (Doesn't have to be Godly, but it'll be great if he is as well <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  ).<br><br>Thank you very much. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Dex-based Bard 26/Rogue 13/Shadowdancer 1 although no Ranger.<br>I see nothing wrong with a Ranger/Bard... Bards are not only singers, they are artists. Being a nimble artist of sneaking is perfectly right.

He said nothing of RP, so I merely thought out the fastest and most combat viablie I could think of. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>But singing is art, even in the forests, you just have a less appreciative audience than in the cities. ^^<br><br>And he could make art out of wood, animal bones (from allready dead ones ofc) and fur while being a ranger too.

Close to the request but not quite; Bard21/Druid12/Shifter7 would get a +10 to hide and move silent in kobold form, give you HIPS and druidic buffs including camoflauge, mass camoflauge ect. Naked with epic focus and buffs you could easily take his hide/move silent scores up to 80/65, more with items and bardsong.

I just remembered, a cleric with trickery domain gets a +1 per 2 cleric levels to hide and move silently. I'd rather go the shifter route though, as it has no duration limit, would end up one skillpoint better, and who dosent love an angry little kobold?
