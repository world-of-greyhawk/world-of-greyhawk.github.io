hmm, yup. so you switch improved combat casting to your level 39 feat, let go of epic fortitude (you have pretty good fortitude saves anyway, actually) and add empower spell or a combat feat (toughness or dodge might help the build).<br><br>The Base Attack should be 28, 2 off the max.  Add 7 for the strength bonus to get to 35, add one for weapon focus and another for epic weapon focus and another for epic prowess and you get to +38 with no buffing.  4 attacks per round, critical range of 17-20 (15 to 20 with keen).  Divine Power, Strength Domain, Bull's Strength will add to this and the quite acceptable damage that the character can dish out.  <br><br>I am sorry but I haven't been able to build this past level 12 yet.  It is a fun build but I am thinking that it is going to be extremely hard to put off leveling to level 5 as a cleric.  Darkfire.

I'd personally drop improved combat casting for this build. <br><br>You can use defensive casting mode to get the same effect once you have high enough concentration.  You don't have any other combat mode feats (power attack, expertise, etc...), so you don't really gain anything by not using defensive casting mode all the time.<br><br>frees up two feats for whatever you'd like to take.

hmm, i like it. it's really more of a buff build anyway, at least at the early levels.  that really would help the build -- it is quite lean on feats.  hmmmmmmm... so you could take toughness and dodge pre-epic, helping your ac and hps, and still take epic. . . reflexes are probably your worst save with all of the fortitude you get as a pre-epic paladin.

I thought the dispel on hit for the holy sword spell was level dependant, making 14 levels of paladin only reliable to dispel pre-epic casters.

Just leveled the build to 18.  The build does not have the requisite dexterity for dodge, so toughness is a pretty easy call.

Now I have leveled to 29 and have some thoughts err hindsight.  I think there is little to no reason to take any paladin levels post epic.  take paladin to level 8 to maximize the ab (2 off max pre-epic) and get the 4 attacks per round (you really only need four levels to do that if you don't mind your ab being 3 off the pre-epic max).  You can then take Cleric to 19 and Rogue to 13.  If you wanted to have one late-level paladin class to take discipline to the max, you could do that and still cast level 9 cleric spells (Rogue 13, Cleric 18, Paladin 9).  Trading a level 9 cleric spell for the paladin's level 4 holy avenger spell just doesn't make any sense to me, plus you get a bonus rogue feat this way and another sneak attack d6.
