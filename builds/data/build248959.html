<b>Tuoni</b> is the finnish God of Death ruling the Tuonela (finnish underworld) and in the AD&amp;D 1st edition incarnation he has the club as his symbol. His priests were known to be eager to administer final rites to the seriously wounded (or not so seriously either) on the battlefields actually helping them reaching the realm beyond thanks to the persuasive power of a broken skull. The belongings tha those they "helped" carried with themselves became theirs, of course, as a reward for their help in reaching the realm of their master. Interesting cult, ain't it? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">   <br><br>Tuoni is a CN god with evil tendencies in AD&amp;D 1e, btw.<br><br>Tales related to the Tuonela can be found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalevala" target="_blank">Kalevala</a>, a (the?) finnish epic poem. <br><br>***********<br><br>We've got a highlevel Cleric here, in two variants: battlepriest (STR route) and imploder (WIS route). Bard's in to help with singing the hymns <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    and also with tumble and UMD. Fighter's in purely for the club exploit which is at the heart of this build, so, please, do not suggest dropping it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>Because of the restricted choice of the Cleric's bonus feats the STR variant has got a higher than usual WIS for a battlepriest. It means more spell slots and a higher will save, so no harm comes from it.<br><br>Domains, theme wise, should include Death. Powerwise I'd go for Trickery and War, but pick whatever you prefer. Anyhow, anything that helps the priest administer death should be fine with Tuoni <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br>In the WIS build you could go with STR 10, DEX 8, WIS 18 starting for -2 AB/dmg, -1 ref save (AC will be covered by Cat's Grace/AoV) but +1 Implosion DC and extra spellslots. I wouldn't do it though.<br><br>Enough ranting, here we go with the build.<br><br><br>*********************<br><br><br><b>Tuoni's Minister of Death - WIS build - Cleric(38), Fighter(1), Bard(1)</b><br>Human, any non lawful (CN theme wise)<br><i>PvM, Playable 1-40</i><br><br>STR: 14<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 16 (34)<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 440<br>Skillpoints: 217<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 24/34/16<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9<br>BAB: 25<br>AB: 31 (melee), 26 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/full plate and tower shield): 20/31 <i>(32 with Cat's Grace)</i><br>Spell Casting: Cleric(9)<br>Non Evocation DC: 22 +spell lvl<br>Evocation DC: 28 +spell lvl<br>Implosion DC: 40 <i>(46 with capped WIS)</i><br><br><br><b>SKILLS</b><br>Concentration 43(45)<br>Discipline 41(43)<br>Perform 4(3)<br>Spellcraft 43(45)<br>Tumble 40(40)<br>UMD 41(40)<br>5 points leftover<br><br><br><b>LEVELING GUIDE</b><br>01: Cleric(1): Spell Focus: Evocation, Greater Spell Focus: Evocation, Domain Trickery, Domain War<br>02: Cleric(2)<br>03: Cleric(3): Weapon Focus: Club<br>04: Cleric(4): WIS+1, (WIS=17)<br>05: Cleric(5)<br>06: Cleric(6): Extend Spell<br>07: Cleric(7)<br>08: Cleric(8): WIS+1, (WIS=18)<br>09: Cleric(9): Empower Spell<br>10: Cleric(10)<br>11: Cleric(11)<br>12: Cleric(12): WIS+1, Improved Critical: Club, (WIS=19)<br>13: Cleric(13)<br>14: Cleric(14)<br>15: Cleric(15): Blind Fight<br>16: Cleric(16): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br>17: Cleric(17)<br>18: Cleric(18): Toughness<br>19: Cleric(19)<br>20: Cleric(20): WIS+1, (WIS=21)<br>21: Cleric(21): Epic Weapon Focus: Club<br>22: Cleric(22)<br>23: Cleric(23): Armor Skin<br>24: Fighter(1): WIS+1, WS: Club, EWS: Club, (WIS=22)<br>25: Cleric(24)<br>26: Cleric(25)<br>27: Cleric(26): Epic Prowess, Epic Spell Focus: Evocation<br>28: Cleric(27): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br>29: Cleric(28)<br>30: Cleric(29): Great Wisdom I, Great Wisdom II, (WIS=25)<br>31: Cleric(30)<br>32: Cleric(31): WIS+1, (WIS=26)<br>33: Cleric(32): Great Wisdom III, Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=28)<br>34: Cleric(33)<br>35: Cleric(34)<br>36: Cleric(35): WIS+1, Great Wisdom V, Great Wisdom VI, (WIS=31)<br>37: Cleric(36)<br>38: Bard(1)<br>39: Cleric(37): Great Wisdom VII, (WIS=32)<br>40: Cleric(38): WIS+1, Great Wisdom VIII, (WIS=34)<br><br><br>********************<br><br><br><b>Tuoni's Minister of Death - STR build - Cleric(38), Fighter(1), Bard(1)</b><br>Human, any non lawful (CN theme wise)<br><i>PvM, Playable 1-40</i><br><br><br>STR: 16 (26)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 15 (24)<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 440<br>Skillpoints: 217<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 24/29/15<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9<br>BAB: 25<br>AB: 37 (melee), 25 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/full plate and tower shield): 19/30 <i>(31-32 with Cat's Grace and/or AoV)</i><br>Spell Casting: Cleric(9)<br><br><br><b>SKILLS</b><br>Concentration 43(45)<br>Discipline 41(49)<br>Perform 4(3)<br>Spellcraft 43(45)<br>Tumble 40(39)<br>UMD 41(40)<br>5 points leftover<br><br><br><b>LEVELING GUIDE</b><br>01: Cleric(1): Blind Fight, Knockdown, Domain Trickery, Domain War<br>02: Cleric(2)<br>03: Cleric(3): Weapon Focus: Club<br>04: Cleric(4): WIS+1, (WIS=16)<br>05: Cleric(5)<br>06: Cleric(6): Extend Spell<br>07: Cleric(7)<br>08: Cleric(8): WIS+1, (WIS=17)<br>09: Cleric(9): Empower Spell<br>10: Cleric(10)<br>11: Cleric(11)<br>12: Cleric(12): WIS+1, Improved Critical: Club, (WIS=18)<br>13: Cleric(13)<br>14: Cleric(14)<br>15: Cleric(15): Improved Knockdown<br>16: Cleric(16): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br>17: Cleric(17)<br>18: Cleric(18): Toughness<br>19: Cleric(19)<br>20: Cleric(20): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>21: Cleric(21): Epic Weapon Focus: Club<br>22: Cleric(22)<br>23: Cleric(23): Armor Skin<br>24: Fighter(1): STR+1, WS: Club, EWS: Club, (STR=18)<br>25: Cleric(24)<br>26: Cleric(25)<br>27: Cleric(26): Epic Prowess, Great Wisdom I, (WIS=20)<br>28: Cleric(27): STR+1, (STR=19)<br>29: Cleric(28)<br>30: Cleric(29): Great Strength I, Great Wisdom II, (STR=20), (WIS=21)<br>31: Cleric(30)<br>32: Cleric(31): STR+1, (STR=21)<br>33: Cleric(32): Great Strength II, Great Wisdom III, (STR=22), (WIS=22)<br>34: Cleric(33)<br>35: Cleric(34)<br>36: Cleric(35): STR+1, Great Strength III, Great Wisdom IV, (STR=24), (WIS=23)<br>37: Cleric(36)<br>38: Bard(1)<br>39: Cleric(37): Great Strength IV, (STR=25)<br>40: Cleric(38): STR+1, Great Wisdom V, (STR=26), (WIS=24)<br><br><br>*********************<br><br><br>Feedback and constructive criticism are, as usual, gladly appreciated.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Unto to the darkness<br>I commend my soul<br>Never shall I repent<br>Never shall I be saved<br><br>I'll go into the House of Death<br>Before my last breath<br>My enemies all shall die!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 08/05/06 09:39</span></i></p>

I think you should make use of magic domain , a 38 lvl icestom is very handy. Or nature domain for creeping doom , at least one domain should be used to get some dmg spells.<br><br>For the Wis version I would suggest to take zen archery.I see the build is based around the club and the bug that you can pick up EWS with only 1 fighter lvl, but theres not much use for dmg when you dont hit.Sling or throwing axe can both be used with shield, and if you go halfing you could raise your ab even further, by 12points if I am not mistaken. <br><br>About the str version I dont like that you end up with a wis of 24 , but cant be done much about that unless you want to lvl up without having all higher spell slots available till 32. But you should post a lvl 40 (or lvl 32+) with only 20 wis , the ab will be higher and for easy lvling servers its not that bad to have no high lvl spells for some time.<br><br>Could you post buffed ac /ab too , since you get alot of buffs to increase those too.

With a self buffed AB ranging from 54 to 56 (and capping at 57) you should be hitting without too much trouble.

Playable and self-sufficient and ready to deal with anyone or anything at least in PvM, but to a large degree also in PvP. That's what Clerics are all about. The club exploit largely helps your damage so you don't have to buff every time you need to whack some monsters by taking just a single fighter-level. Pure builds can be quite fun, a tiny bit of multi-classing makes them even better, skillfully proven here.<br><br>Interesting thing about a Finnish god, not what you hear the most about. Finneous should like this.<br>I like the skullcrasher name very much too.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>
