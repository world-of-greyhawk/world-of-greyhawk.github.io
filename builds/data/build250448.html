Hmmm, solid I think, it's not bad, although I could make a lot of arguments on why you should dual-wield instead, I'll leave it at the fact that you can easily change Luck of Heroes, Iron Will and Great Fortitude for Ambidexeterity, Two Weapon Fighting and Improved Two Weapon Fighting.<br><br>Yes, you need 15 DEX for Ambidexterity, but lower your initial STR to 17, increase CON to 14 (and increase DEX at level 4) and you'll get 2 APR and +40 HP at -1 AB and damage loss, sum up how much you increase your chances of critical hits and/or sneak attacks after Knockdown.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 08/21/06 02:24</span></i></p>

Well, you've got 16 pre-epic BAB, which gives you 6 APR, 7 with Flurry of Blows, so I'd say it increases from 7 to 9, which is the unhasted limit.<br><br>Well, it's not a must or anything, I'm just suggesting, but you're not using your offhand, when you could get 2 extra APR with a relative high AB.<br><br>Your AB (FoB): +38/+35/+32/+29/+26/+23/+38<br><br>Predicted dual wielding AB (FoB): +35/+32/+29/+26/+23/+20/+38   +35/+30<br><br>Oh, as you can see, Flurry of Blows extra APR doesn't gets the dual wielding -2 AB penalty for some strange reason, and offhand doesn't gets monk AB progression. In general, one handed will make a higher max AB, but dual wielding gives you 2 APR at high AB with a low AB loss, you make 5 attacks over +30 with two kamas and 4 with 1 kama.

With 8 levels of monk I get 1d10 with unarmed strike, with Kama I get 1d6.  <br><br>Should I go with unarmed strike or Kama here, or would it depend on if Kama were available with extra elemental damage or somesuch?<br><br>Also using Kama frees up the hand slot to get stats there so it seems like this is a toss-up right?
