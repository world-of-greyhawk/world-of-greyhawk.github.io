I don't think you can build a character with those stats all that well - it's too feat-starved. Why don't you just use one of those Bard/PM/RDDs with really high AC? Or Bard/Fighter/PM? PMs are now immune to sneaks at level 10 PM anyway so Epic Dodge and SCV are unecessary. You might not find them but you won't get sneaked and you can really do some hurt.<br><br>Here's something really crappy which does Get ED/SCV but it sucks, but you never said it had to be good!<br><br><i>Lifeless Shadow</i><br>Race: Elf<br>Alignment: any non-lawful<br>Classes: Bard 11/ PM 10/ SD 19 (might want to push to 20 if the server has modded the SD's abilities to be better)<br><i>Not really meant to be played</i><br><br>Stats:<br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 19(32)<br>CON: 12<br>INT: 12<br>WIS: 8<br>CHA: 13<br><br>01: Bard(1): Dodge<br>02: Bard(2)<br>03: Bard(3): Weapon Finesse<br>04: Bard(4): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>05: Bard(5)<br>06: Bard(6): Mobility<br>07: Bard(7)<br>08: Shadowdancer(1): DEX+1, SD: (Hide in Plain Sight), (DEX=21)<br>09: Shadowdancer(2): Weapon Focus: Mace, SD: (Darkvision, Evasion, Uncanny Dodge I)<br>10: Shadowdancer(3)<br>11: Bard(8)<br>12: Shadowdancer(4): DEX+1, Two-Weapon Fighting, (DEX=22)<br>13: Shadowdancer(5): SD: (Defensive Roll)<br>14: Shadowdancer(6)<br>15: Shadowdancer(7): Ambidexterity, SD: (Slippery Mind)<br>16: Pale Master(1): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br>17: Shadowdancer(8)<br>18: Pale Master(2): Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>19: Pale Master(3)<br>20: Pale Master(4): DEX+1, (DEX=24)<br><br>21: Pale Master(5): Epic Weapon Focus: Mace<br>22: Bard(9)<br>23: Pale Master(6)<br>24: Pale Master(7): DEX+1, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=26)<br>25: Pale Master(8)<br>26: Pale Master(9)<br>27: Shadowdancer(9): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=27)<br>28: Pale Master(10): DEX+1, (DEX=28)<br>29: Shadowdancer(10): SD: (Improved Evasion)<br>30: Shadowdancer(11): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=29)<br>31: Shadowdancer(12)<br>32: Shadowdancer(13): DEX+1, Epic Dodge, (DEX=30)<br>33: Bard(10): Self Concealment I<br>34: Shadowdancer(14)<br>35: Shadowdancer(15)<br>36: Shadowdancer(16): DEX+1, Self Concealment II, Self Concealment III, (DEX=31)<br>37: Shadowdancer(17)<br>38: Shadowdancer(18)<br>39: Shadowdancer(19): Self Concealment IV, Self Concealment V<br>40: Bard(11): DEX+1, (DEX=32)<br><br>Max HP: 336<br>BAB: 24<br>AB (dual-wielding 2 mundane maces): +36/31/26, +36/31<br>AC (naked): 35<br><br>Saves:<br>Fort: 19<br>Ref: 34<br>Will: 21<br><br>+7 vs. spells<br><br>Skills:<br>Discipline: 43(43)<br>Tumble: 40(51)<br>Spellcraft: 34(35)<br>UMD: 39(40)<br>Perform: 17(18) &lt;-- enough for 11th-level bardsong<br><br>Hide: 30(41)<br>Move Silently: 30(41)<br><br>NOTE: I'd have forgone Hide/MS completely but you need Hide 30 and Move Silently 30 as well as DEX 30 and Improved Evasion to qualify for SC.<br><br>Gets level 3 bardic spellcasting.<br><br>Might want to drop one SC for Epic Prowess to get the miserly AB up.

K, i am NO epic dodge master, nor have i ever considered a sc 5 build, myself, but I do know somethin about a dexer (which is what this is).  Feat starved?  How?  As far as i can see, sd needs dodge/mobility  move sil 8 hide 10 tumble 5...  non of that is too difficult with a cleric build (which i did).  Never mind a bard which gets most of those as class skills.   The thing you have to do is get your dex to 30 asap (by lv 30).  There are really only 2 choices  elf or halfling with 20 dex base. By 20 you have 25 and you need 2 gr dex plus 24 28 and 32 so at 33 you can get sc 1!   Taking 10 sd lvls quals you for epic dodge, which you can get as feat say 27 (need 25 dex).  I guess you'd go epic sd to get sc on the epic sd feats, and you should be able to squeeze the points in before 40 (i do not know when sds get epic feats, but assumin jenna knows what shes talkin about AND I DO ASSUME THAT   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   ) they get a feat eery 3 lvls epic.  So id guess 10pm/22sd/8bard could be a useable combo.    But its up to you.  <br><br>Peace

"Hearing a faint whisper of frustration, he decides that this world is comin down around him.  He recals with joy the day one such player was removed from the world because of defensiveness and rudeness and not playing within the parameters of society.  Oh how he misses the ramblins of the T.........    OOPS almost spoke her name!!   (If you say it 3 times, she will return!)   And then the world of epic will be lost in the vain ramblings of a terribly lost soul.   avado guesses that the legend of the banned one has been lost on the youth of today.  He looks around in HOPE that people will start to listen to each other.  TO help people get what that person wants, not what THEY want!  For the true secret in life is to LISTEN to what is asked.  To respond to what is asked!  ANd to remain silent on things that prove you werent listening in the first place.  avado is shocked as to what has happened in the last while amongst the epics.  He ponders, why do they quibble about such trivial things?   Maybe the old dwarf is right.  Retire!  Ah, but that is too short.  And what would an epic do, not building?  Hmmm..   that is the question of the ages.*<br><br>On a more serious note, if you really want to get a bard/pm/sd take jennas outline above and use it.  What I'd suggest, is to make it more of a tank, and drop all dual feats.  Get a good large shield and go out and bash away.   Get as much ac as you can find.   The thing with epic dodgers/sc5s is that they LACK damage feats IF they are not rogues.  YOU cannot have everything <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   but with a cleric/sd/wm you can just about have it all  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  (no sc5 is out of the question there.. to many things goin in way to many ways).<br><br>LISTEN.  listen.  listen.<br><br>Peace

About the build... Have you considered going halfling? that could grant 1 more AB and AC. At least he can "singlewield" when he needs more AB, that can bring up his AB to a semi-decent 39 "singlewielding" or 37 dualwielding.<br><br>The problem is the fact he will need to go with daggers. But that's not much of a problem at least for me. 1 less average damage but better critical range.<br>_________________<br>HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh.

I did. Doesn't matter, really, about the daggers (doesn't get Imp. Crit unless you want to drop Dual-Wielding since the feats are so scarce).

Guess I was hoping for a build with more PM levels for better AC.  Other than bonus feats, I don't see much reason to more SD over 10...And I don't care if I can't hit a thing....

You can't get the SC feats with PM bonus feats but you can get Epic Spells. You need the SD Bonus Feats to get SCV (which you wanted).<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:. Only those who have known darkness in<br>(OvO) their hearts will see the shadows in life...<br>(|__|)<br>..".."..

as noted:  these are things that shoulda been noted  BEFORE a build was suggestd.  Just an observation.  <br><br>Jenna is right: if you want pm&gt;&gt;10 you cant get sc5 unless you can get dex to 30 by lv 24 (impossible).  If this is the case, think about wiz8/sd10/pm22.  You will have to drop the whole sc thing cuz you cant get sc5 without bonus feats (there arnt enough).  At least this way you could have, sort of, a caster-like build.  Very weak, but you could pump dex to 25 lv 1-20, and then pump intellignce to get lv 9 spells.  Not a terrific option, but is an option for non-damge seekin build.  Btw, since sd gets tumble you can take sd 10 at lv 37 to get tumble to 40 and take epic dodge at 39 (if you want it).  Also, since ac seems to be most important, take improve expertise (adding even more feat strain to tryin to get to sc5).   <br><br>I really like the idea of a pm with sc5!  It would be one heck of a time, but the only way i see (at the moment) is to increase sd lvls (somethin you arent lookin at).  hmmm...  an impossible build?<br><br>Peace<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 11/05/05 05:41</span></i></p>

You have to make some choices. The defence is easy to get good. The AB will often suffer. <br>It is feat starved because you have to take 5 SC feats, ED and 2 or 3 Great Dex, leaving little left for other epic feats.<br>You might question the wisdom of taking SC5 with a bard build that has Improved invisibility.
