Is there a Half-Orc Barbarian/Rogue/SD in the guild?  Not by my count.  I swear there was a Terrifying Rage HiPSter somewhere, with that class combo.  Maybe I'm thinking of Grizz's Heart of Darkness.  I can believe that there isn't a Half-Orc, but surely there's a human build, right?  Why can't I find it?

But no STR build?  Is the distaste for STR based HiPSters that strong?  I guess having to spend a feat on heavy armor is a bummer, but from first glance, it seems like it would still be a viable build. Maybe I should build it, then see if there's any great reason it doesn't yet exist.

Nice.  That's pretty much it.  I'd tweak a few thing, but then again, who wouldn't?  I especially like how you made medium armor work.  The minimal AC loss is likely worth the lower hit to H and MS.

Is that just because of the sub-par reflex?  I'd think that a 24 would be enough to make it worthwhile (especially as you can assume that he'd be walking around w/ at least a 26).  I think I'd give up the ESF: intimidate for that, but that's at least partially an environmental consideration.<br><br>Anyways, yup, that will do nicely.  W/out access to the CCBC, you just saved me a bunch of middling.  <br><br>Also, IMO, this is worth officially posting.  It may not be a monster, but it's unique enough, and decent enough, to warrant inclusion.

I realize I'm pretty much having a conversation with myself here, but...<br><br>Seems to me the big knock against this build is the lack of end-game.  It gets HiPS, and TR, and that's it as far as specialness.  Still, I think HiPS, TR, and a mean SA is pretty decent.  Combat vitals aren't impressive, but nor are they much below par.  I guess Dev Crit could be worked in there, which would help w/ the end-game.  Not that I will, but it makes it look stronger on paper.<br><br>Anyhoo... I'm gonna give him a shot sooner or later.  I guess I'll see how it works out.

I think it may be Terrifying... though dont hold me to it!   I remember a discussion he and I had about a build and how he was getting Dev crit, dragon, and Terrifying rage in a PRC build.  Anyway, i asked him if he has input in this one.  Maybe he can enlighten us.

If you are set on half orc you'll have to make choices regarding skills (although you can pump up INT to 16 base, 14 modified to limit the net loss to 43 skillpoints). If you choose to keep Taunt then you will want Barb 16 for the further skilldump, if you drop it then you can go Rogue 24 for the extra feat at the cost of the exrta rage/day. Early TR is pretty much desired on WoG and similarly early HiPS (SD in epic would net you +1 AB but it ain't worth it IMO). You may want to egt Barb 1 at 2nd lvl to get advantage of the extra speed right from the WoG bat.<br><br>It's definitely playable, that many rogue levels and SD take care of it. Barb adds some nice extras. What weapon are you planning to use?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 06/07/10 18:34</span></i></p>

I do think I'll take the first barbarian level at level two.  The HP boost alone is huge at those levels.  The armor profs make it nearly necessary.  It delays an extra SA dice a level.  I love me some SA die, especially at low levels, but I can push that back for a bit of barb.<br><br>Half-Orc is a whole 'nother can of worms.  I think it's very likely that I'll talk myself out of using the half-breed, but, just for kicks...<br><br>Taunt's gotta go.  It's sad, but he's not in an especially good position to taunt (I mean, mechanically, of course, as character-wise...).  He's got a sub-par AC, and sub-par HP.  Uncanny Dodge is something, but he still doesn't need to be asking for more hits.  Plus, when he needs to, he just rages.  Sure, I love Taunt, and it's always a shame when you use a class w/ Taunt and don't take it, but them's just the breaks.  Besides, there's just not enough left to cut.  I can't see investing 10 points into INT, so that's another 43 points to cut, which I think you need to do bit by bit from all the rogueshness.  That eliminates the ESF: Taunt, which you can drop for a GRT STR, and drop Prowess for the second GRT STR.  The extra rogue bonus feat can happily be more SA, or imp evasion.  It's not so bad, but it's clearly inferior.  Sigh.  Poor Half-Orcs.<br><br>I'm thinkin' I gotta make him a Two-Hander.  It's rough, as I'm always afraid to play sub-par AC builds on WoG (because it's rough), but I can't see takin the hit to stealth from a shield.  He'll obviously carry one, but it won't be the focus.  <br><br>As to what will, probably Great Axe.  That might be a bad choice for WoG, but I've plenty of Halberders, and he just doesn't seem Great Swordish.  That said, I don't think I've had a Great Sword wielder on WoG, and there are certainly good Great Swords to be had.  Anyways, yeah, two-hander, not scythe.  I may even drop WF for a CEP weapon.  Those Falchions are always tempting...

You can go with deadly vs epic trap skills and/or cut on the OL, though IMO 16 INT (14 modified) is worth the cost. You can buy 16 INT at the cost of 2 CON and 2 WIS or go for 14 STR (16 modified) and keep epic trap skills.<br><br>I wouldn't go for a CEP weapon (I dream about the day we will be able to tak eCEP weapon feats), -3 AB is pretty significant and your mundane AB is nothing special; also, less AB is virtually less AC (you kill your enemies slower hence they hit you more) and protection is already an issue. I would also go weapon and shield and unequip the shield when necessary... -8 AC (eventually) is just huge and even -3 is quite significant. Yet HiPS can take you out of trouble so 2-handed ain't that bad an option as it would be otherwise. Greatsword would be a good choice and not unfitting either.<br><br>I would consider Epic Will for your free epic feat slot (after droppin gTaunt and ESF: Taunt) especially if dropping Iron Will preepic due to H.O. vs human. Remember also that if you go for 14 INT (12 modified) you must drop IKD.

Yah, I hear ya on the AB w/ a CEP weapon.  True.  He's not in the position to make those sacrifices.  <br><br>Concerning weapon choice, I figure that the majority of time he'd be looking to take advantage of his stealth investment, and hence, the lack of shield would be worthwhile.  For WoG, I'm figuring he's using his HiPS once per round.  The shield would come out when constant stealthing was either impossible, or less desirable than the alternative, which, hopefully, would be the minority of occasions.
