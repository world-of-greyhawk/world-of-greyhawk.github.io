YOu realize you still need 35 perform to make use of 30 bard level curse/bard song?(which may explain why no one else has done 30 bard!)  otherwise interestingly done.

Yes, I do, sadly hehehe. In my (limited) experience I found that either one plays in a very bard-friendly environment or one can just forget about going for a much better song than the lvl 16 one. But I also thought hey, there must be people out there who play in such environments, and for those people I think this bard can add a lot to the party, having the necessary levels for the best song and all spells and delivering some damage to boot. I personally dont think the build is estelar, and it will die many miserable deaths in the hands of people who dont play their bards smartly, also because you have HiPS but zero discipline (I have also found that many think that HiPS = invincible). But keep commenting, and thanks for the comments already given.<br><br>Edited to add: Actually I think he needs 46 more points in Perform for the 30 lvl Bard Song, no? The numbers in parenthesis are the scores after Bard Song is applied (the Bard Song that he can achieve with his naked perform, I mean)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By OCNT Dogo on 10/02/08 04:42</span></i></p>

Well, looky here.  Another STR based SD.  Using your bard song to get decent use out of a STRer's stealth skills is an interesting idea, but I don't think WM is at all worth it for the build.  Even a few fighter levels instead (30/2/8?) could work better.  Toss in EWS and maybe a bit more stealthing in the form of SF/ESF?  Just think you're askin' too much w/ WM.

What's nice about this one is you do get a decent Bard Song, but you have to do the strip tease to cast any of your spells.  Given that Warcry is now somatic, it becomes a real pain.  Your crits are going to be god-awful, though.  I don't have any suggestions really, as WMs tend to pin you in a corner.  I might suggest going Bard26/SD7/WM7, as it gives you a bit more defenses via spells and those crits that would wipe you out in one shot, but maybe not worth it since you lose a Bard bonus feat.<br><br>As an alternate, you could flip it on its head and go Bard8/SD7/WM25, but that's a different build.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Thanks everyone for the comments and suggestions. And no, I wasn't all that impressed with the build but at least that's another Bard/SD/WM in the Guild. I played the build to 40 in single player, but in my perfect scenario he would have a party and would wear robes/cloth armor for the full benefits of his nice H/MS (for a STR build)while taunting, casting, scouting, HiPSing and hitting enemies that were engaged to someone else. Well, good experiment for first post here  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    But alas, I still dream of the day when all DMs/Builders will reward dedicated Bard players with awesome items with Perform boni, so here comes the Iconic Skald in all his 40 Bard levels glory and the need for 40+ Perform in items!!! Hehehe Thanks again folks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By OCNT Dogo on 10/03/08 04:19</span></i></p>

It is OK to make builds for that role as well. If you tell us we will judge the build according to that.<br>Bard is well suited for party play.<br><br>One thing you get from 30 bards levels is "indispellable" spells (well actually from 25 lvls). If you make a bard with focus on casting and singing as a support character, you want to focus more on charisma. <br>A character that only knows singing, casting, taunting and HIPSing can work well in a party.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 10/03/08 12:25</span></i></p>
