i always though gmw does not stack with weapon enhancement. like if i had +4 enhancement on a weapon and cast gmw that gives +4 there would be no effect... but it affects my ab, <br><br>so would that mean only ab is affected by gmw if equal to weapon enhancement?<br>_________________<br>Where we belong, there's no one to hurt. It's someplace we can't be felt. Where we belong it's darker than space, a feeling that we all push down until we can't be found

You always thought correctly. GMW and Weapon Enhancement do not stack in any way. Only the strongest effect is taken in consideration.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

If the character sheet tells you otherwise, then it lies.  Check the combat logs.
