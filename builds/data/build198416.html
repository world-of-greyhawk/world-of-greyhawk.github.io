<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>Okay, the revised (and, IMHO, much improved) version of the Blessed Sneak. Kudos to Grizzled_Dwarflord, Stravinsky00, and Mithdradates for the excellent suggestions for improvements. This should be easily playable from level 1 to 40 (I don't know about PvP, as I only build with PvM in mind). Here it is:<br><br>Rogue 19/Cleric 15/CoT 6<br><br>Human, Any non-evil<br><br>STR 10<br>DEX 16 (32)<br>CON 12<br>INT 12<br>WIS 16<br>CHA 8<br><br>1 )Rogue 1: Ambidexterity/Two Weapon Fighting<br>2 )Rogue 2<br>3 )Rogue 3: Weapon Finesse<br>4 )Cleric 1: DEX (17)<br>5 )Cleric 2<br>6 )Cleric 3: Silent Spell<br>7 )Rogue 4<br>8 )Cleric 4: DEX (18)<br>9 )Cleric 5 Knockdown*<br>10)Cleric 6<br>11)Cleric 7<br>12)Rogue 5: Empower Spell* or Improved Critical*/ DEX (19)<br>13)Cleric 8<br>14)Rogue 6<br>15)Rogue 7: Imp TWF<br>16)Rogue 8: DEX (20)<br>17)Rogue 9<br>18)Rogue 10: Weapon Focus/Improved Evasion<br>19)Rogue 11<br>20)CoT 1: DEX (21)<br><br>21)Rogue 12: GRT DEX I (22)<br>22)Rogue 13: Defensive Roll<br>23)Cleric 9<br>24)Cleric 10: GRT DEX II (23)/ DEX (24)<br>25)Cleric 11<br>26)Rogue 14<br>27)Rogue 15: Epic Weapon Focus <br>28)Rogue 16: Epic Dodge/ DEX (25)<br>29)Cleric 12<br>30)CoT 2: GRT DEX III (26)/GRT WIS I (17)<br>31)Cleric 13<br>32)Cleric 14: DEX (27)<br>33)CoT 3: GRT DEX IV (28)<br>34)CoT 4: GRT WIS II (18)<br>35)Rogue 17<br>36)Cleric 15: GRT DEX V (29)/ DEX (30)<br>37)Rogue 18<br>38)Rogue 19: Crippling Strike<br>39)CoT 5: GRT DEX IV (31)<br>40)C0T 6: Epic Prowess/  DEX (32)<br><br>*These could be anything of your choice.<br><br>Domains: I'd go with Strength and Trickery. Strength mainly for the Divine Power buff at levels 3 and 4 (as well as 5 with the Silent Spell feat)<br>Trickery gives the Invis line of spells, ending with the excellent Improved Invis.<br><br>Final AB dual-wielding and unbuffed with a mundane weapon is: +38.<br><br>Buffed with Divine Power, it rises to +43 and gives you 3 attacks at your highest AB, 2 at your second highest. You'll get even better AB by stacking more Cleric buffs on that.<br><br>Hit Points: Not a strong suit with this character, but you have Endurance/Empowered End. to get yourself a few more.<br><br>Unbuffed Saves (Spellcraft Bonus vs Spells):<br><br>FORT: 25 (33)<br>REF: 35 (43)<br>WILL: 26 (34)<br><br>Naked AC: 29<br><br>Final Stats:<br><br>STR 10<br>DEX 32<br>CON 12<br>INT 12<br>WIS 18<br>CHA 8<br><br>Skill points: total of 304<br>Skills (modified): <br><br>Hide: 41 (52)<br>Move: 41 (52)<br>Tumble: 40 (51*)<br>UMD: 41 (40)<br>Conc: 39 (40)<br>Spell: 39 (40)<br>Disc: 43<br><br>20 points left over for secondary skill concerns.<br>* No effect on AC for the extra points.<br><br>Spells: You get an extra slot due to WIS of levels 1,2,3, and 4 spells.<br> <br>Total spells:<br>Level 1: 7<br>Level 2: 7<br>Level 3: 7<br>Level 4: 6<br>Level 5: 5<br>Level 6: 4<br>Level 7: 3<br>Level 8: 2<br><br>Lots of slots, and lots of versatility with the couple of metamagic feats to fill up the spellbook with useful buffs.<br><br>Cast Ultravision and load up on Darkness spells to generate sneak attacks.<br><br>You get an excellent Darkfire boost on two weapons, Bull's STR to up your damage, all the good Cleric buffs to augment AB/damage, and a good number of spells per day. The 15 Cleric levels serve to max out many of the effect/level buffs as well as providing decent spell durations.<br><br>Sneak attack is an acceptable 10d6.<br><br>This could proabably be relatively easily adapted to a Halfling build with a couple of adjustments. You'd net +1 AC and +1 AB due to small stature, but pretty much be restricted to daggers for dual-wielding. Now, if only I could get this to work with a Dwarf... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>Suggestions/criticisms welcome.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 06/06/05 21:02</span></i></p>
