Hey all, I saw this post a long time ago, and have always wondered how this build would be possible...I took a while off from the game, but now decided to come back and play around a bit more, and was just wondering how to do this...the original post: <br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13422", "167154", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Build This:<br>AC with +5 max gear over 75<br>AB with +5 weapon over 55<br>Devastating Critical<br>Crit Immune<br>Self Buffing<br>No save below 35<br>4 attacks/round<br>Max Skills in: Heal, Disc, Spellcraft, Tumble, Listen<br>Would like to include Spot<br><br>Think you can do it? I'd sure like to see. Seems like PM is needed, for AC and Epic Mage Armor. The AB is the hard part. I've made one that is very close to this, just lacking on the AB by a couple of points.<br><br>How is this possible plz? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">

Easy, Cleric/Bard/PM, I'm not sure if the saves will make it, but AB will be higher and Divine Power makes up for the APR, Bard for the skills and it's obviously a great buffer, 12 PM should go nice, or 16 for Epic Warding if you wish even more power. I just don't know if it's "valid" to do that in your parameters.<br><br>Tumble can be taken without being a class skill, if you don't need that then go with Cleric/Wizard/PM and you'll get much more arcane slots.<br><br>Do you need me to make the build?<br><br>Cleric 21 / Bard 3 / Pale Master 16<br><br>Feats, pre-epic: Cleave, Power Attack, GCleave, WF, Empwoered Spell, Extended Spell, saves feat<br>Feats, epic: EP, EWF, Ov Crit, Dev crit, 2 GSTR and Armor Skin<br><br>PM bonus feats: no idea, you could get Epic Mage Armor or Epic Warding if I'm correct...<br><br>*Empowered spell could be changed for another saves feat without affecting much, AB will decrease but it's already above the needed.<br><br>STR = starting 16 +10 +2 = 28<br><br>Domains Travel and War<br><br>BAB: 25<br>AB: +38<br>AC: 10 base, + 8 tumble, +8 PM, +1 DEX, +3 Tower Shield, +8 Heavy Armor = 38<br><br>Buffed AB (Empowered Bull's STR and Aura of Vitality for +5 STR modifier, + all Cleric stuff): 64<br><br>Buffed AC<br>Haste +4 (Dodge)<br>Shield of Faith: +5 (Deflection)<br>Magic Vestment: +10 (Armor and Shield)<br>Undeath's Eternal Foe +4 (Dodge)<br>+5 natural from items<br>+5 Dodge from Monk's boots (you've got UMD)<br>71<br>Pretty darn close.... you could use another UEF for 75, it will still stack, or also Epic Mage Armor +5 dodge, stacking up to 78, but Epic Warding is so much better.<br><br>Now that I think about it, with +5 items on everything, simply a lot of PM will give you the AC, as you see only UEF and Haste are what Cleric gives above +5 items. Maybe a STR based (maybe start with 20) Paladin/PM/Bard with Divine Shield could get your requirements too, especially if there is perm-haste there, and the saves will go up with the Paladin.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 08/20/06 22:33</span></i></p>

Thanks, I'll have to see what I can come up with from your suggestions at the end as well, but great build, was pretty much what I wanted to know!
