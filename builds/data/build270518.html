<i>Robbing from the Rich and Feeding the Poor PvM (1-40) and PvP</i><br><br><br><b>ROBIN HOOD (“Wildwood Warrior”)</b><br><b>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar</b><br><br>This character is a concept/RP build, but a fun one (and me thinks an effective one, too), being inspired by the legendary Robin Hood: the legendary character himself (some believe) inspired by a British noble (knight) turned outlaw, or so the story goes, a “woodland pirate” of sorts, who is said to have defied the King by living in the forest with his “band of merry men,” laying wayward travelers (allegedly taking from the “rich to give to the poor”), and hunting the King’s Deer, all against the King’s Law. <br><br>Deer were protected by the King for sport hunting, to be enjoyed at leisure by himself and his nobles, during a time when there was no assistance or social-safety net for the poor, such that the laws (preventing people from hunting for food, for e.g.) led to starvation, while nobles enjoyed their leisure hunting and sport). Regardless, and whether the man (or men) upon whom the legendary Robin Hood was supposedly based limited his “taking” from the rich alone, or to all who passed, his thievery was said to be carried out with courtesy, skill and piety; while he glorified violence in a time of violence, it was the medieval ages, when so few had enough to eat, much less any land and, with no education or assistance, the vast majority simply had little or no opportunity to better their station in life. Hence, the legend of Robin Hood: a man, a knight and an outlaw, whither based on any truth or fiction, is the story of a scoundrel turned egalitarian and philanthropist who, from the C 16th onwards became the poster boy for philanthropy, and the legend continues to inspire philanthropy today, such that his is the legend that lives on, a “national hero” for he did that which his King could not (or would not) do: care for and take care of the poor.  <br><br><br>Method Behind the Madness:<br>Robin Hood, the Wildwood Warrior (also known as the Prince of Thieves), is the first of a two-character series (being also a variation on the other character (dedicated to the legendary philanthropist and his merry band, and in time for Easter); this build, while similar to his companion, is comprised of more WM in lieu of Ranger (as compared to the Wildwood Minstrel), thus enjoying higher natural AB but no bane, but with the fighter brought into the mix (instead of bard) for more feats, including weapon specialization in lieu of i.e. bane (but no taunt or umd). To see the other variant, as discussed, entitled, the Green Knight, the “Wildwood Minstrel” (Bard1, WM13, Ranger 26), please: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "270516", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>           <br><br>Other Builds:<br>While not the first of its kind in terms of the class combo selected (there being 3 others, namely: (Fighter 7 / Ranger 26 / Weapon Master 7), <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "176438", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> by bpberryWRC; Grim Ripper (Ranger 25 / Weapon Master 7 / Fighter 8 )  , <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "253168", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> by Grimnir77 ; Foe Hunter (Ranger 25 / Fighter 8 / Weapon Master 7), <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117669", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> by Lockindal (all being nice ranger-focused builds), this one is the first to take on epic wm, for higher AB and also the dual-blade focus, among other differences.<br><br>This Build:<br>In short, the idea of this build is optimal use of the double-bladed weapon – i.e., two-bladed sword or the double-axe, and hence, the ranger class (enabling STR-based, dual wielding w. 6 attacks/round), bolstered by fighter (combat feats and weapon specialization) and WM (for the wide crit range, high AB, etc.); in short, these classes combine to produce a solid melee’r with  high natural AB, and nothing short of exciting damage output. The main draw back of this build is that it is a straight-forward melee’r, thus low saves and no innate casting (i.e., apart from i.e. potions and gear, which some players might find frustrating). That said, this warrior’s reflex is not so troublesome in light of his/her HPs (over 500), but will is a problem (then, a typical weakness of most melee’rs, such that clarity potions are your friend). Vis-à-vis other meelee’rs, this warrior has more than ample HPs to withstand a beating, and also has decent AC (especially for a dual-wielder), with the ab necessary, if and when desired, to take the ab hit on either donning plate or entering expertise mode, at-will, as you desire); add to this the fact that s/he has pretty good stealth and the ability also to set deadly traps, Robin Hood, the Wildwood Warrior shines solo (PvM) and is also very solid PvP—capably holding his/her own as against other melee’rs, and dishing on behalf of any party.

Hmmm, I always thought of Robin Hood as mainly using a bow, with a rapier or quarterstaff as backup. This presents a bit of a problem in NWN, since a bow uses Dex, and a quarterstaff isn't finessable (but then Little John knocks Robin into the creek when they fight with the staff, so maybe this would still fit with the RP). <br><br>I would probably make him something like a Ranger/Rogue or Ranger/Bard with focus on longbow and maybe rapier as well. He definitely needs a class with Tumble as a skill (he always pulls those acrobatic moves....). You could take some fighter for feats. WM doesn't seem to fit to me since I see him as focused on the bow over the rapier. It's too bad plain NWN doesn't really have an archer class - the PRC Archer would fit him well, or the bow-focused v3.5 ranger.<br><br>TM

Truth be told about dear old Robin, the fellow he was based upon (supposedly anyway) was a real plate-wearing knight, a noble who went off to the crusades in or around the 1100s, and when he returned to Britain, was dispossessed of his lands (and hence, the woods); and while Tuck used a staff, Robin used a sword (and indeed, as legend goes, when Robin attempted to use a staff to "play" with Tuck, he got himself tossed into the creek). As legend also has it, while good with his sword of course, being trained on same, he wasn't much of an archer though (one tale tells of how he was challenged to an archery contest by the local sheriff, but was so bad that his future wife, being none other than "Maid Marion," a strong combatant/master archer herself, showed up at the contest cloaked, pretending to be Robin, no one the wiser, and so good was she that she cleaned up in his name (yes, I've decided another build is in order, in her honor of course -- as to Robin though, keeping in mind the real person (or persons) upon whom he was based, FTR/WM to me seems rather knightly (can't exactly make him a paladin afterall - I mean, the guy did steal from folks, even if his heart be in the right place ... sneaking around, setting deadly traps, as a ranger, w. "knightly" wm/ftr prowess and specialization seems to fit, in light of his beginnings (and in the end of course, according to some stories, was pardoned and given a court post (so as to become a knight proper again, ...

Ah, I am thinking of the old Errol Flynn movie Robin, while you are aiming for a more historically accurate Robin. If you view him as a heavy armor knight who is not good with a bow, then str-based makes more sense. I still might be tempted to drop WM for Rogue, but it works.<br><br>TM

Er, why yes, Dwarflord: thanks to Marion <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  <br><br>Thanks, guys: appreciate your wonderful response, and good to see you both!

In drafting Robin, keeping in mind his true knight heritage, the mix seems right to me; but, yeah, I admits: I went for the double-blade (alright, as a knight, he no doubt really used the bastard sword, aka the sword-and-a-half, being the weapon of choice back then) ... but, heh, I had in mind also the legends, too (i.e., the staff - and hence, we go double-blade (and must say, when it comes to the damage on that thing, it's legendary I tells ya <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">  <br><br>That said, will def. put my mind to a good archer build to join the "Robin Hood" series (but I tells ya, it was Marion - a noblewoman, as the story goes, disguised as Robin, who was the one to split the arrow in two ...

I would think the two-bladed sword is wrong no matter how you see it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Unusable in heavy plate in this case too. The penalty will be -6/-10 with only 1 off-hand attack. Compared to -2/-2 with light armour. I also doubt the legend of a woman in Englands 10th century to be the best bowman to be found. That's another story though, and I do not doubt the prowess of women in general, just the prowess of one at those times which were quite discriminating I assume. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>Please don't kill me for saying that Deborah. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    <br><br>Well, and that's why she disguised herself of course (ah, sadly, it's true: in those days, after the fall of the so-called barbarians, before the Renaissance, women in medieval times had few options (even if nobles, had to typically marry due to the rules of inheritance (ensuring their offspring were the ones to inherit); of course, there were very stong women at the time, among them Queen Elizabeth I (who refused to marry); others, took to the high seas (yes, numerous female pirates), and in this same spirit is the legend of Marion herself; based on a real-life historical character, the daughter of an Earl (or so the story goes), who insisted she would not marry except out of love. Even then when Robin (or the man on whom he is allegedly based) was pardoned and restored to knighthood (thus presumably getting her father's blessing), she still refused (or so the story goes) until the "merry men" were likewise pardoned. Like Robin himself, Marion is based in fact but also a collage, not much attention paid to her part in the story until much later though (those were the times)...<br><br>Ah, different times, indeed, and such a great story all-around: a so-called lot of "no good thieves, rebels and scoundrels" who stood together, inspiring not only an egalitarian society if you will amongst themselves, but also philanthropy - ahead of their time (or were they merely recounting older values, as exist not only today but also before the rise of certain institutions (then, came Charlemagne, and much later the Renaissance, and today, well ...

As to the dualing, it's true he suffers (due to ranger armor restrictions) when in plate, as noted in the build; however, plate is just that, an option if you should ever have occasion to need it, and is in addition to CE (giving +5 AC/-5 ab when in exp. mode, which by itself covers off the diff. b/w leather and plate (and which he's the ab to handle); also, in mid-high magic settings, where you'll find dex items, there's no difference b/w leather and plate (leather's not hampered by any celing on dex bonus to AC); still, in the earlier levels, before everything kicks in etc., plate's a nice option to have, yes? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>As to the dual-blade, it's an awesome weapon, it really is: delivering more damage than a greatsword, with 6 apr being wonderful in itself, but also comes in handy when up against high AC characters (not to mention, more opps to land those oh so wonderful crits). That said, could switch to kukris, shortswords, or the scythe, but I wouldn't recommend it: I've been playing around with this build and dbl-blade a lot lately, and must say, it not only looks cool, but is surprisingly effective <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>Must say also how thoroughly wonderful is this entire discussion - and always so good to see you, Grim <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 04/09/07 19:08</span></i></p>

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>*sigh* yes, as much as I love the double-blade, you're right (I know, on the one hand, stay true to the real guy (i.e., blade) but, at the same time, trying to incorporate the staff legends, and you know what they say about that: doesn't work <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>So, with that, for those who want to stay true, Robin here really should be equipped with the bastard sword (as noted above, since it was RP-wise and historical-wise the true blade of the period knights, and thus no doubt what Robin, being a knight (pre-outlaw and post-pardon) actually carried -- build-wise, it also be a very handsome weapon <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   ... i.e., not only the 1.5 str. bonus on damage two-handed (ok, not 6 apr, but still, the str. bonus be nice, too); another benefit is that not only does it enable the use of plate (no worries there, since dualwield penalties no longer applicable), but can also equip a tower as desired, while enjoying the full extent of your high, wholesome AB - not too shabby at all (note: and exactly the reason why the knights used this sword, i.e., full might when used two-handed, but enabling the use of a board, if and when necessary, too -- cool <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>That said, plate not recommended for sneaking/setting those deadly traps though, for which you'll enjoy having leathers on hand; this, even although (and it's true) most pcs simply don't top out there detection, they just don't but, really, why take the chance if you don't have to, right? - Enjoy! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>OK, so if picking up the sword-and-a-half (as the bastard sword was historically known, and Grim be right on that, folks), here be the adjusted stats for that:<br><br>Combat Vitals (AB and Damage):<br>• Mundane Bastard Sword: <br>o AB +51/46/41/36<br>o Damage: 1-10+24 (crit: 15-20/x3) (-6 one-handed)<br><br>• Assuming +12 STR, haste, and +5 Keen Weapon: <br>o AB +62/57/52/47/62<br>o Damage: 1-10+38 (crit: 13-20/x3) (-9 one-handed)<br><br>Bioware Caps (+12 STR, +20 Weaponry, Haste): AB +77/72/67/62/77 (capped ab)<br><br>Defense Vitals:<br>AC 17 naked <br>20 mundane studded leather (add +3 shield, or AC 23)<br>25 mundane plate (add +3 shield, or AC 28)<br><br>• Expertise Mode (+5 AC/-5 ab):<br>Leather: 25 AC (28 w. shield) /  Plate: 30 (33 w. shield)<br>• Assuming +5 items, Dex and Haste (leather or plate):<br>48 AC (56 w. shield) / Exp. Mode: 53 AC (61 w. shield)<br><br><br>Thanks, Grim - an excellent point, it 'tis, and thanks!<br><br>BTW, and further to the archer build, TM and I be working on a Maid Marion, and a couple others of the "merry men" forest clan, too -- so, stay tuned folks: a merry build there'll soon be for all! (well, at least the main characters: according to legends, there were over 150 members living with Robin in the woods which, back then, be a village! And what an incredbily fun series this is, totally, and such wonderful comments and interest all around - thanks be out to all - much appreciated, and thanks so much again! ~ Tyr <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
