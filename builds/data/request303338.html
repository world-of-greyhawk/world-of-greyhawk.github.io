Alright, I've gotta say this is fun... I like that we have builds both old and new coming out for some time in the limelight. <br><br>Getting away from racial exclusivity (IE Dwarf builds), I am calling for self sufficient rogue builds... <br><br>Must be a rogue that can fight on his or her own, have all the skills to treasure hunt, survive traps, identify his or her findings, heal his or her own wounds, use scrolls if there aren't any casters around. This will be a tall order as I am looking for a good all around rogue character with the skills and feats to survive in any PW and prosper well. This also considers that the character will have to defend his or herself from others trying to steal treasure or perhaps be aggressive enough to take what's required from anyone who stands in the way.<br><br>I don't know if this is completely possible but I do know that there are some builders here that will come as close to the perfect rogue as the game will allow.<br><br>No racial or class restrictions, the only thing to consider in this department is what most PW's allow and don't allow. Please keep in mind survival skills like lore, heal, and any others that some PW's are directing more focus on these days like search, spot, listen and others. This should be a skilled individual that would be welcome to any party for the sheer ability of making treasure hunting that much easier.<br><br>Let the games begin.... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"><br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.

WOW, you forgot to ask for Epic Dodge, sc 5, dev crit and divine and arcane lv 9 spells...  Not to mention max Parry, and.. LOL  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   jk (i just love when people give a grocery list of shiznit without ever attempting to build it themselves!  imvho, you learn more by building SOMETHING and having it critiqued than to do the laundry list bull*(#* )<br><br>What you are looking for is a Cleric24/rogue16 type of split.  THis gives you the freedom to solo with the divine spells (you ONLY need 19 wis btw).  DONT (i saw one of your builds!) DONT put all the cleric and rogue levels together (well you can, and it would be smart to start with 20 cleric, but thats me!).  Show some pinash!  Mix it up and have fun!<br><br>now go and BUILD!  DO it here and someone will come along to correct it.. but not me.

You can switch out Discipline and Spellcraft to grab Heal and Lore (although you can always grab potions of Lore as well as items and scrolls that enhance it for identifying). This guy is better suited to a party, but can solo if you're good with Rogue tactics.<br><br>*edit* This build needs to be adjusted to make him legal due to the change in requirements for Epic Dodge in patch 1.69, but it shouldn't be too big an issue.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "224634", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Subtle Axe</a>. A STR-based Rogue. Again, you can shuffle some skills around to get Heal and Lore. This one's pretty decent and would likely be quite welcome in a party as well. I love sneak attacking with a two-hander. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   <br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "198416", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Blessed Sneak MK II</a>. Not as many skill points, but he's got the CLC spells to heal himself. You'll need to be a lot more picky as to what skills you take though, due to the dearth (for a Rogue-based build) of skill points. You'll need to do a bit off feat/level shuffling with this one though because patch 1.69 made this one illegal (can't get Epic Dodge before level 30 now). He can self-buff and has some tricks up his sleeves, but low caster levels make him extremely vulnerable to dispelling.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 11/17/08 05:43</span></i></p>

You can trust in Cin's Rogue's builds.  Cin knows his Rogues.  The first one, especially, is in my mind completely self-reliant.  I think a party would slow him down.<br><br>Now, the question is, how many Rogue levels qualifies as a Rogue build?  In my mind, any Rogue build with 16+ levels should be able to solo on his own.  The rogue class in general lends itself to that, and once you start throwing in the other classes, like SD, PM, etc., then the stock goes even higher.  To that end, the possibilities seem almost endless, and their number is legion in the ECB.  And there are also quite a few that are now "illegal" due to 1.69.<br><br><br>But, the Rogue's greatest deficiencies are damaging the sneak immune and Will saves.  To that end, I will recommend an Epic Dodger who can deliver divine damage when sneak and EWS isn't get the job done, and you're fresh out of holy traps.  <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "299430", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> The Blade Runner</a><br><br>There are so many, though.

I wasn't going to post this, but you requested essentially what I had already built, so I customized it for you. Heal is there as requested, but I'd move 40 points of it (and Epic Skill Focus) into Spellcraft, and the other 3 into Lore, giving you a +6 to spell saves.<br><br>Pick any Rogue, Simple, or Martial weapon you want, but I'd recommend warhammer for the almost-never-resisted blunt damage; longsword because there are usually lots of cool longswords in a module and it's a solid weapon anyway; or scimitar, for more frequent chances at Dev Crit. All 3 let you use a shield for the additional AC.<br><br>He can find and disable all epic traps, and with deadly traps, he can also recover and set them. All bets are off if the module has customised trap DC levels.<br><br><b>Rough-and-Ready Rogue (Rogue 26 / Fighter 4 / Champion of Torm 10)</b><br>Human, Non-Evil<br>Playable 1 - 40,

The other thing they do is limit potions, they are just not as useful as heal kits, thus the heal skill is more justified. <br><br>I am not requesting these builds for my own purposes as much as getting some suggestions out there to all of us players that might not be as good at building a superior and balanced character build that will hold it's own and do well.<br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Nestrial Darkfalcon on 11/17/08 15:33</span></i></p>

For my money, rogue/fighter/CoT is a classic of balance.  How it's build will kinda heavily depend on environment, but if you focus on the rogue, you should of oodles of skill points to choose from (though, of course, not enough.  There are never enough.).  W/ a full APR, and the bonus feats to pick up everything you need, melee presence should be fine.  The CoT even serves to help out the bane of a rogues existence, the horrendously bad will save.  Toss in the will boosters and it should be quite acceptable.

Just for grins, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "249630", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Here</a> is one of my favorite Rogue builds. One of the very few Elf builds I actually like. Again, this is one where you have to adjust for the new Epic Dodge requirements, and you'll have to shuffle some skills about as well to fit in with your challenge. And if you prefer SD to HS, it's easy enough to switch it out (and it's suggested in the build discussion).<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

The other thing they do is limit potions, they are just not as useful as heal kits, thus the heal skill is more justified. <br><br>I am not requesting these builds for my own purposes as much as getting some suggestions out there to all of us players that might not be as good at building a superior and balanced character build that will hold it's own and do well.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>what you have to understand is, as long as you build and post it in this forum, (not the actual epic builds part) we are here to help.  The "corrections" come when drivel is posted as an epic build and then tried to be defended by even more drivel.<br><br>SO, have no fears.  There are some on here who are excellent at twinking builds.  The tone of my message is becasue we get people who are essentially lazy wanting the "BEST" build <a href="mailto:bulls@#t">bulls@#t</a> without any work or skill.

Thanks Cinn, a nice pointy ear there. Yes, Avado, thanks for the encouragement. I did start putting together a build to do with my Dwarven Cleric/Defender post and I was close to having him ready to post yet at the end I got messed up a little and decided not to post him as other topics had come up. <br><br>I've been cooking up an idea with this rogue post too but haven't put it to paper and testing yet. I'm working out a Rogue/Bard concept, let's see how far I get with that.<br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.

Thats the beautiful thing about this section of epic builders guild.  You can put up a please advice post and say, this is what i have so far, can you help me twink it!  You will get TONS of suggestions (normally (qualifier!!)).  <br><br>Why is this a better way to go?  We get to see what you are wanting in the build.  YOU get to learn from the suggestions of some of the best building minds on the planet!  AND you can ask them questions to understand WHY they suggest what they do.
