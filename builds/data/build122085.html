<b>Playable from level 1 - 40  ..PvM Build</b><br><br>Hey prq, here it is.<br><br>I used gnome to avoid xp penalties for a long time, and gain a constitution bonus. This is more of a well rounded build, it does excel at damage but not as much as other builds.<br><br>ranger 21/wizard 15/ftr 4<br>gnome<br>str 14 +7 from lvls +X great str<br>dex 8<br>con 18 +3 from lvls<br>wis 8<br>int 16 +2 from wizard feats (lvl 5, 10, 15)<br>cha 8<br><br>Take wizard first lvl.<br><br>The only real requirement for pre-epic is a focus in a weapon. If your server has locking grip gauntlets, take a lvl of wizard pre-epic on a feat lvl up to gain 2 weapon fighting. Since ranger lvl 9 gives improved 2 weapon fighting, wear those and dual wield. My gnome used daggers, and I named him Stabby, otherwise, 2 handed with a scimitar or rapier works well. As well as greater spell penetration I felt.<br><br>The spells you can gain from ranger are kinda worthless next to the wizard spells I felt.<br><br>Remember to take lvl 4 ftr on a feat lvl up so you can gain epic specialization.<br><br>Take bane of enemies on a feat lvl up with your 21st lvl of ranger.<br><br>Use the ftr 1 and 2 bonus feats for dmg reduction, and one general feat.<br><br>So epic looks like:<br>wizard 5/10/15: great intelligence x2, epic spell penetration.<br>ranger 21, and 1 feat: bane of enemies<br>ftr 1 and 2: dmg reduction x2<br>ftr 4 and 1 feat: specialization, epic specialization.<br>1 general feats on: dmg reduc 3<br>5 genaral feat on whatever: most likely, prowess, and epic focus, great str x3.<br><br>In the end, you have full wizard buffs up to lvl 15, if your server has locking grip gauntlets, or you choose to wear light armors, you can dual wield with only one feat investment, and have lots of hated enemies.<br><br>All in all, I had a lot of fun with this character simply because you hardly expect a gnome to have a lot of hp, and a couple of dagger stabbing for 30+ dmg per hit.<br><br>My only main gripe was I ended up having too many skill points to spend on nothing and had lower str. The size bonus makes up for the lower str generally speaking though. Its a pretty flexible build overall, and a gnome ranger dealing lots of damage is always hilarious especially since he had epic dmg reduc to survive better than most melees.<br>_________________<br>I may not be able to get an erection, but at least I have enough balls not to hack.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 04/30/05 16:52</span></i></p>
