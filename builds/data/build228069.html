Hail, and well met!  Welcome to these old halls of stone, whose pages are lined like so many catacombs, filled with heathen kings and heroes, proud villains and seditionists, witches, warlocks, and those foul things that go <i>bump!</i> in the night.<br><br>____<br><br>Epic Dodge plus high hit points plus decent damage reduction are all good things to see in a build.  This gives him the potential to last a while in combat.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure if it's worth it.  One can't last that long if one isn't doing reciprocal damage.  One can build a similar build using Fighter instead of Ranger, and Rogue instead of SD,  and then have the same DR, Epic Dodge, and have sneak attack/WS/EWS and UMD on top of it.  And still dualwield.  There would be no loss in skill points because the Rogue's 8 points would counter the loss o ftwo betweeen Fighter and Ranger.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Not really , neither the epic shadowlord or the non epic shadowlord summoned at level 16 (when you are level 40) are effective as offense. Only as defense/meat shield. It excels at that since it has 30/+2 DR. <br><br>Against anything with a +3 weapon they are both toast very quickly. Against spell casters they are either immune or not. If they are not you might get an extra round out your pet if the mage was stupid enough to target it, since its not even going to hit a mage at that level. So its only use is PvE against melee types or against magic/effect using monsters to which it is immune. If its immune it doesnt matter which you use against melee one has 70 hp and avoids half the attacks the other has 176 hp and gets hit by just about every attack (except on a roll of 1 most likely). <br><br>Ultimately it means that a level 40 character with a level 16 shadowlord pet of either variety is going to be just as effective as the other except for those extra 36 hit points. If they ever fix the bug (and it is a bug) that the Epic shadowlord has no concealment then I would change my stance on this, but I would say that about level 21 would be the earliest I would consider putting a feat into Epic Shadowlord. With the AI mod its slightly little more complex, but not overly so.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

Indeed, I meant that you oversimplify by saying that 50% concealment equals having twice the HP. It definitely does not. For example there's a 0.5^5 chance of missing five times a row. You could miss 100 times in a row, the game doesn't make every other attack miss and every other hit, it rolls the 50% chance every time (if the attack roll is successful). Then you have to consider Blind-Fight... there are just too many variables.<br><br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br>_________________<br>Too long I have suffered the desert sands of time~<br>But as I drown in darkness it will release the sign~<br>My soul will leave this mortal coil of flesh and earthly life~<br>to fly into the mist of night, into the nightside eclipse~<br> - by Emperor<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 01/25/06 12:40</span></i></p>

Firstly blind fight is mainly found on PC/NPC. At level 40 I would doubt if you would even summon a shadowlord to fight a PC. Its good against monsters.
