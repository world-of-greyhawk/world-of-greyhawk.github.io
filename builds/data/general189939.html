I am looking for a solid construct form build.<br><br>Is there a version of this build that uses lots of monk levels? I can't seem to find one anywhere. <br><br>-Pendragon

2 questions first<br><br>Do you want a level 40 build, or a build that gets construct shape early?

Well, something like druid 5 shifter 11 monk 24 then would probly work ok.<br><br>Start as a druid at level 1 with a wisdom of 17, and achieve a 4/16 split by level 20 in druid/monk levels, remember to take alertness as a pre epic feat.  At lv 21 take a final druid level then take 10 shifter levels, having put all stat increases into wisdom and taking a couple or 3 great wisdom feats you should qualify for construct shape at level 33.  Then proceede with taking monk levels up to level 40, perhaps taking a final late druid level to max spellcraft.<br><br>The version I just made as a quick test had a con of 20 as well, giving the Iron golem form some 620 hitpoints, coupled with the wisdom of 28 and 40 ranks in tumble, the naked shift to iron golem had an AC of 46 and SR of 34, not too bad as a tank I suppose.

Well, I made a rough version and the AB at lv 40 with no items in Iron Golem form was 36/33/30/27/24.

I've played around with some shifter builds but they all end up with a terrible ab (in relative terms) the server I play on I can hardly hit anything because everyone has 20 DR and 70 AC or something like that.<br><br>also I think 10 shifter is enough for such a build so you'd be able to get an extra monk bonus feat going Druid 5/Shifter 10/Monk 25.

You need to be an epic shifter to take construct shape.

I know for Undead shape 10 levels is enough even though it says epic is required.
