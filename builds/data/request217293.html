DwDs don't get high AB. If you want high AB in melee, you usually go high WM levels but if you do that, you'll have little DR. You can't have your cake and eat it too.

Add in +4 for Weapon Focus, Epic Weapon Focus, and Epic Prowess. That's a total of +34. That's the absolute highest you can get from BAB and feats.

This means an AB of: 30 (BAB) + 4 (feats) + 10 (STR) = +44 AB. So, you want 4 more AB. That means 19 levels of WM. Now, to muddy the waters, you need to get your DR in as well. This means at least 21 CON, which means you're going to have to spend ability increases and/or feats to get it that high. Every increase or feat you use to raise CON is going to take away from your STR, thus lowering your AB. Also, every WM level you take is one less DwD level, which lowers your DR.<br><br>I think the best you can do is probably what I laid out in my previous post. You could go for the +48 AB, but I think the best you'll be able to do with DR is probably 12 or 15. But, just try putting a few builds together with different levels of DwD and WM and see what you come up with.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

*Sigh* I wish I'd remembered your post Cin, before I posted this. Talamier's build gets 21 DR and with the 4 more Great STR, gets 43 AB with the WM bonuses of AB and Crit. multiplier and threat range. DR is less than Cin Din's posted suggestion but WM bonuses add a lot more to offense. Take the warhammer and take Imp.

I enjoy playing dwarven cleric/DDs. The cleric lvls helps your AB problems the DD has, or might have. You can get 21 to 24 DR and still maintain quite good AB. While buffed at least. Cleric/CoT/DD. Go Cleric10/DD10 pre-epic. Take some CoT lvls in the epic to get your Wis high enough for the spells you need. Ending cleric anywhere from 12-15. Cleric 12/CoT6/DD22 is a combo I enjoy. The DD levels alone give you 15 DR, and CON, if you go that path, might give you 9 mor, for max 24. The cleric gives you by far the best AB for a 24 DR build. I know you asked for natural AB tho. But this is a way to get both that natural AB won't give you.<br><br>My experience playing DDs tell me that 15 DR is about the breaking point, my CLC/CoT/DD has only 15, a 32 STR for very nice buffed AB. 15 DR is enough to turn battles your way. A good AB, 15 DR and Heal spell availible makes it a hard to kill opponent. Remember that he is sneak immune to. Well, not completely. One thing that really bugs my arse off tho is that Def Stance doesn't work when you cast, but expertise do!

I think its tough to KD a good defender. But as for sneak immunity, its in the DDs defenses. As long as you have a target to strike, he will not receive sneak attacks, is what I think. but you may be right, its possibly only defending against flank sneaking.

I agree with Cinnabar Din, knocking down a DD is not impossible.True, IMO it should be nearly so...what's that DS for otherwise, aren't you supposed to keep your ground?

You are right about flanking rule. As for KD, Discipline maxed and STR build will make it somewhat resistant. When 3.5 is upon us, Dwarves will enjoy +4 to resist KD to.

IMHO a DwD should be very difficult to KD...maybe a further resist bonus to KD for the DwD would make things right. I guess it's also something easy enough to implement for module builders.
