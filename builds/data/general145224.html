First off I have a question as to why a lot of the palemaster builds posted have 16 lvls of PM. Immunity to critical hits is achieved at lvl 10 so I was wondering what was the reasoning behind the extra 6 lvls.<br><br>Secondly, I'm looking for the best melee PM build with dev crit and a high AB. I do know that a palemaster/cleric build can achieve an AB in the 70's along with his AC. I just don't know the specifics of the build. I've messed around with a ranger/pm and a fighter/pm and their AB's are in the 50's but I was just wondering if anyone has posted the build I'm looking for. Heck if someone else has worked out the kinks then they can save me some time. Thanks.

So a 16 PM gets 10 extra ac from lvls, access to up to 3 epic spells, and 2 bonus feats.  It adds a lot to a build.

Ahhhh that indeed is a good reason for taking 16 lvls instead of 10. This gives me something to play around with now.
