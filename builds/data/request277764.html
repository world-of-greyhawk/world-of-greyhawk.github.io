Ok first off i have some requirements i need to fill first.<br>These are what i need must be half orc and chaotic evil the first 4 lvls must be barbarian.<br>im using a subrace on a server i play and when i pick the subrace i want i get some different abbilities when i pick the sub i gain +3 to str and constitution.<br>But i lose -2 to dex/int/wis/char at lvl 1.<br>So please bare this in mind due to my request.<br><br>Ok what im after is the strongest possible pvp build u can think off using these changes i gave you.<br><br>on my server the items are +5 to ac and ab. u can add abilities to items but at only +1 and also items only let u add 3 enhancements so for instance u could have a tower shield with +5 to ab +1 to str and +1 to constitution or u could make a cloak with +1 cons +1 str +haste.  <br><br>Im looking for a pvp build something which can reach decent damage im thinking possibly a high dc dev because off the str advantage i get from the sub race and from terryfing rage. so that leads me to possibly look for 2 options Barb bard rdd or barb mage pm.<br>We can change alingment aswell so no class restrictions i just need the first 4 lvls to be barbarian.<br><br>Also im looking to use scythe for high damage and if i remember right i can also use tower shield so this would be sweet.<br>We have access to scrolls on server and also we can craft wands or scrolls our selves so would like umd so then that leads me to the Barb bard rdd. Please hook me up with a lvl 40 build layout using these extras i posted at begining<br><br>Ty very much....<br><br>Happy building campers <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Here is a build I came up with real quick on my lunch break...so some things could be wrong, might have to double check it later.<br><br>Half Orc<br>Chaotic Evil<br>1-40<br><br>Barbarian 28/ Bard 2/ RDD 10<br><br>STR   20 (32) (44 w/Mighty+Greater Rage)<br>DEX    6  (8)<br>CON   16 (24) (36 w/Mighty+Greater Rage)<br>WIS    6<br>INT   10 (12)<br>CHA    6  (8)<br><br>AC    23 (naked) (21 w/M+G Rage)<br>AB    45/40/35/30 (51/46/41/36 w/M+G Rage)<br>      2-8+16 (+25 w/M+G Rage) <br>      (19-20/x4)<br>HP's  752 (992 w/M+G Rage)<br><br>Saves<br><br>Fort  29 (35 w/M+G Rage)<br>Refl  15<br>Will  15 (22 w/M+G Rage)<br><br>Levels 1-20 Barbarian<br><br>1.

Barb28   Thundering Rage<br><br>I forgot that you might want Dev Crit, never build with that, so you would have to make some changes which I dont have time for right now. Also forgot Skill Points. I think it should be around 150 or so...I would max out Discipline, Intimidate and Tumble. I also am not sure if the starting Attribute points are correct.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By galelabriel on 07/02/07 17:48</span></i></p>
