To all members of this guild!<br><br>If you want to start posting your NWN 2 builds soon as possible, there is now a new guild for NWN 2!<br><br>Here is the link and name, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14504", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Part Deux</a><br><br>However, please be patient while I set up everything and get all things in place for NWN 2, such as rules and so on... Due to difference between NWN 2 and NWN, such as four class than the usual three that we are used to. There will be slight modification to the rules, Kail Pendragon and all other current moderators will devise a new sets of rules once everyone gets established. But it will be about the same overall.<br><br>And I will be opening two other forums at some point if anyone has good suggestions to what to make them into. Such as voting for best NWN 2 builds? And so on...<br><br>EDIT: In addition, if anyone wants to know where I got part deux from for second ECB guild, I am hoping some people will recognize it... if not, it came from Hot Shots!

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  I wonder how many levels we will have for first expansion. Perhaps since we have 4 classes for NWN 2, it seems inadequate to have 40 levels... although that would provide a challenge to get best out of all four classes. Perhaps by second expansion level 60? We will see what will happen in down the road.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.

I hope they stick with the first 20 lvls only and implement other stuff like psionics etc, but we'll see.<br><br>Epics arent that bad either <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>I'm still fiddling with lots of characters before actually doing the campaign, you guys made me addicted to tweaking characters!<br><br>And Hot shots indeed owns <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>// Maniac_Mailman aka Nr|Five<br>_________________<br><i>"Omnes morimur et quasi aqua dilabimur in terram, qua non revertuntur..."</i><br>- Maniac_Mailman aka Nr|Five<br><br>Admin @ NWN BOTD Team PvP<br>Admin @ <a href="http://www.gameshrine.org" target="_blank">www.gameshrine.org</a><br><br>Member of the Epic Character Builders Guild
