Please read the sticky which link is in my signature and post the build in a format similar to the one found there. It makes the build easier to read and to be commented upon.<br><br>Thank you.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 04/14/06 02:31</span></i></p>

What does Paladin even do for this build, except immune to fear? Fighter would be muuuuch better. Cleric would make it rock, and allow you to start both monk and Cleric and SD pre-epic, i would suggest Cleric12/monk4/SD4. You will become a beast then, but no invention.<br><br>Now for the build as it is. How do you get to 20?

You are very right when you say fighter would be a better choice... When I first started this build I was thinking that pally buffs would be able to help him out quite a bit, but now I realize it will hardly help him out at all.  And as for leveling, I play on a server where you could get a level 40 in 1-2 days if you play  frequently. Along with that, there are a bunch of parties.<br><br>So any idea's on what the build would look like If I where to change it to cleric?

As for Paladin buffs, you're missing Divine Might and Divine Shield, you do get Divine Favor, but make counts, if you take Cleric you get a lot of more buffs, you can use Divine Power for the loss of AB, and you can still aim for divine Might and Divine Shield (if you like, although feats could be short), it would also boost playability, as Clerics are very powerful if you have low magical weapons, you can make a +5 enhancement plus darkfire plus diine favor (just to start, those are the main) by yourself, clerics rule on low levels, another help is that it lets you take Monk at the beggining  (you took paladin straight for BAB, now use Divine Power) to get the bonuses early.<br><br>Now, that's a lot of change to the build.......<br><br>I don't get why you take Skill Focus Discipline, I mean, it only gives +3 on checks, Epic Skill Discipline I accept, but not pre-epic, it's a waste of a feat and it's not a prerequisite for anything, better to take Blind-Fight and Toughness.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 04/14/06 21:34</span></i></p>

Definitely go cleric or fighter instead of paladin and free up the points from CHA to either pump DEX more either raise STR and/or CON. <br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

Being a dexer the change of CHA should go for CON, Dex is high already, it could make damage from Cleric buffs (non-physical damage) rather than STR.
