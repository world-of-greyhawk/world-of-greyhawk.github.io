I posted a build less than a month ago asking the same question. Here's the very helpful response from onion eater:<br><br>"Instead of the parenthesis below, use brackets.<br><br>(url="insert address here")The name of the Build, or whatever text you'd like displayed as a link (/url)<br><br>So, a link to google, that would appear as reading "Google" in link text, would be (again, w/ parenthesis instead of brackets):<br><br>(url=www.google.com)Google(/url)"<br><br>Hope it helps, but really, had you been looking into the builds posted by other people, you would've already known the answer.<br><br>Anyway, as for the build I'll take a deeper look after I finish work today.<br><br>Take it EZ!

I'm not trying to sound rude here, sorry.<br><br>The level combination sounds right to me, but, what are the benefits of 19 blackguard levels, and why unarmed over kama?

Sneak Attack cannot be it, because if so, 19 levels of Rogue would not only give more Sneak Attack dice but also the possibility to get Epic Dodge AND UMD. So really I cannot see ANY GROUNDS to have 19 BG levels with such a low charisma score. Another benefit from BG is the fighter-type AB, which is really null because of Divine Power. The only other thing that comes to mind is Taunt. But really, all that for Taunt?<br><br>I could suggest many improvements:<br><br>- Exchange BG for Rogue and change the level spread to Cleric 20 / Monk 10 / Rogue 10. You'll get 5d6 SA instead of 6d6 from 19 BG, but you'll have 9th level Cleric Spells. Drop 2 DEX for 2 WIS to be able to cast them, you'll lose a little AB, but if someone can buff AB it's the Cleric and also drop CHA to 8 and get 10 STR for carrying capacity and to at least not get such a heavy damage penalty. Drop Toughness and Strong Soul for Blind Fight and Empower Spell. It'll add a lot of versatility to your spellbook and will allow you to cast Empowered Cat's Grace and Empowered Owl's Wisdom for better AC / AB. Get Monk 9 for Improved Evasion and on Rogue 10 get Defensive Roll, then you get Epic Dodge. This build WILL GET XP PENALTY, which can be reduced at least if you manage your leveling correctly. To have an easier time leveling up, go cleric 12 monk 4 rogue 4 pre-epic and cleric 8 rogue 6 monk 6 on epics. The downside to that is only getting ED at lvl 39, because you'll need to get UMD as high as possible with that last Rogue level.<br><br>Anyway, whenever you have a character with such a high DEX score and no Epic Dodge, you gotta try to squeeze it in there. Since BG here won't give you any significant improvement, IMO that's the best way to go.<br><br>Take it EZ!

This build could be a lot more interesting, if not better, if it was charisma based and the BG was good for something.<br><br>For epic dodge, I'd shoot for, like Max said, 20 Cleric / 10 Monk / 10 Rogue or 26 Cleric / 9 Monk / 5 SD...That does change the build significantly though, kinda.<br><br>Also, in my experience, for a level 40 build, level 8 spells cleric are enough when you're not wisdom based.

I would think that cleric 26 monk 9 sd 5 is a better build overall than cleric 20 / monk 10 / rogue 10. If you think that 9th lvl cleric spells aren't all that good, you could go for Cleric 16 Rogue 13 Monk 11 and get Crippling Strike from that last bonus feat, which would also allow you to get ED MUCH earlier. You'd also have 7d6 sneak attack damage instead of 5d6 but any dispel magic effect cast on ya would definitely hurt you. However, to dispel you, they gotta see you first. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Take it EZ!
