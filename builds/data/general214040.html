I like the double-sword and want to build an assasin that can wield it effectively. But I am not sure how to add str and dex. I feel that I should have at least a str of 18 to get a +4/+2 unbuffed damage roll. Would it make sense to go to str of 18 and then switch to adding all other points to dex? I am worried about putting all the points into str because even if I max out on tumble I will have a very poor ac. Any suggestions? <br><br>PS. I plan on being a ranger 10 and all other lvls will probably be assasin. I won't take on lvl of SD for the HPS.<br><br>PPS. Planned feats to lvl 20 are exotic, weapon focus, pwr attck, cleave, impr critical, disarm, dodge, &amp; one to be decided upon. (Yes, Human.)<br>_________________<br>Come on, you sons of b*tches!

You can't finesse a double weapon, so you need STR for your AB.<br><br>What you should look at is getting some DEX intot he build to cover you when wearing light armor. 16 DEX is good if you have access to your Cat's Grace spell and/or potions/scrolls of Cat's. Otherwise, consider raising your DEX to 18 (you could even put a couple points into it later using your Assn bonus feats to grab a couple GRT DEX.<br><br>For an example of what I'm talking about, check out my <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "211779", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Harper Lumberjack</a>. Now, I start with 12 DEX on this build and raise it to 14, but I'd recommend starting yours with 14 and raising it to 16 or 18. STR the rest of the way.<br><br>If you get to 18 DEX and wear studded leather, your AC will only be 2 less than wearing full plate. Not as good, but still not bad (Armor skin will help mitigate the difference).<br><br>Hope that helps a bit.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

That does help. My str/dex started at 16/14. At least I have figured out that I can do this without wearing plate armor. Something I don't want to do. My goal is to make a strong stealthy assasin and plate doesn't fit in. If I max out on tumble and take dodge I should be ok. <br><br>Thanks again for your help. <br><br>Your build is quite interesting. I used to primarily play rogues, and thus, have quite a loathing for the undead. I might copy this and build an undead slayer based on the dire mace. <br><br>PS. As a rogue I often never even took weapon focus but rather used different weapons for different situations. So now I am playing more with specific weapons.<br>_________________<br>Entropy is a joule thief

Another question. Usually my dex is extremely high. Would it be worth it to pick imp initiative as a feat. A +4 on initiative would help quite a bit. (Do you know how much a +4 on initiative counts as dex points?) I have one feat left  over for the first 20 lvls and am not sure what to go with. I think for 20 to 40 feats will mostly go to str and maybe dex.<br>_________________<br>Entropy is a joule thief

I don't know if it would be worth the investment or not, but if you have a free feat slot open, it probably wouldn't hurt.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I usually don't add more points to dex, but use cat's and/or items to reach dex 18 or better.<br><br>If you max the dex bonus you can get from items and spells and you have a base dex 14, you end up with dex 26. That gives a dex AC bonus of 8. That's just enought to "fill" a padded armor.

And the good part is I won't have to wear monk or wizard hand me downs. As a high dex ranger, rogue, or assasin I am a little tired of cashing in every decent armor I get.<br>_________________<br>Entropy is a joule thief
