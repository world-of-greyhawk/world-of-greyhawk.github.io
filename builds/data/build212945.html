Neat.<br><br>I'd consider assigning at least one skill point to any skill which requires training.  That way if you ever need to use the skill, you have it available.  With the big skill boost via Bardsong, even a tiny investment still pays off.<br>_________________<br>Disarm?  That means chopping the other guy's arms off, right?

a very good point - you could lose around 3 from spellcraft and possibly some from UMD. The others need to be left as they are as much as possible.

Why finish RDD 10 so late in the build?

First off you don't get the free 1st feat that a fighter does, nor the wpn spec, and you would not be able to take Weapon Focus in Scimitar until your Base Attack was +7 (ie. when you get CoT open to you), which makes things a little more difficult during those early levels. <br><br>If I had taken CoT then the saves would only increase by 2 points, which isn't worth it IMO. A lot of servers I have played on don't allow more than one Prestige Class anyway, so that played a part as well. <br><br>Anyway I hope that answers your questions <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

I to think it would be very valid to go RDD earlier. Hit the epic levels at fght4/Bard8/RDD8. You would lose bard song a little while, but RDD will more than make up for that. Take lvl 21 and 22 as RDD and go pure bard, I really think that will make it more playable. It will even net you some skill points.

2 years? Crikey, doesn't time fly. Thought I would post this as I had been requested recently. (thanks for the request btw - you know who you are).<br><br>Well that being said, here is the revised version of this build. Bearing in mind my play styles have altered somewhat since I first did this, the build is similar, but has a few differences.<br><br>Anyway here goes:<br><br><b>Taloned Wandering Minstrel</b><br>1-40 PvM<br>Bard 20/ Fighter 10/ Red Dragon Disciple 10<br>Human<br><br>STR: 16 (34)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 15 (18)<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14 (16)<br>CHA: 14 (16)<br><br>01: Bard(1): Power Attack, Cleave<br>02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>03: Fighter(2): Knockdown, Blind Fight<br>04: Fighter(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>05: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Scimitar<br>06: Bard(2): Curse Song<br>07: Bard(3)<br>08: Bard(4): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>09: Bard(5): Great Cleave<br>10: Bard(6)<br>11: Red Dragon Disciple(1)<br>12: Red Dragon Disciple(2): STR+1, Improved Critical: Scimitar, (STR=21)<br>13: Red Dragon Disciple(3)<br>14: Red Dragon Disciple(4): (STR=23)<br>15: Red Dragon Disciple(5): Extend Spell<br>16: Red Dragon Disciple(6): STR+1, (STR=24)<br>17: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=17)<br>18: Red Dragon Disciple(8): Improved Knockdown<br>19: Bard(7)<br>20: Bard(8): STR+1, (STR=25)<br>21: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar, (INT=16)<br>22: Red Dragon Disciple(10): {Darkvision}, (STR=29), (CHA=16)<br>23: Fighter(5)<br>24: Fighter(6): STR+1, Overwhelming Critical: Scimitar, Epic Weapon Specialization: Scimitar, (STR=30)<br>25: Bard(9)<br>26: Bard(10)<br>27: Bard(11): Devastating Critical: Scimitar<br>28: Fighter(7): STR+1, (STR=31)<br>29: Fighter(8): Epic Prowess<br>30: Bard(12): Epic Fortitude<br>31: Bard(13)<br>32: Bard(14): STR+1, (STR=32)<br>33: Bard(15): Epic Skill Focus: Taunt<br>34: Bard(16)<br>35: Bard(17)<br>36: Bard(18): STR+1, Great Constitution I, (STR=33), (CON=18)<br>37: Bard(19)<br>38: Fighter(9)<br>39: Bard(20): Lasting Inspiration<br>40: Fighter(10): STR+1, Armor Skin, (STR=34)<br><br>Hitpoints: 464<br>Skillpoints: 280<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 30/22/18<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9<br>BAB: 26<br>AB (max, naked): 42 (melee), 26 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 23/34<br><br><b>Skillset:</b><br>Concentration 15(19)<br>Disable Trap 1(4)<br>Discipline 43(55)<br>Lore 8(31)<br>Open Lock 1(0)<br>Perform 42(45)<br>Search 1(4)<br>Spellcraft 42(45)<br>Taunt 42(55)<br>Tumble 40(39)<br>UMD 42(45)<br><br>The main differences now allow for a more effective melee presence early on (Weapon Spec, KD, Great Cleave are available earlier).
