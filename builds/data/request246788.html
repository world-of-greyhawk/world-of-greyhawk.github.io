Hi,<br>	I have looked around quite a bit but I have not found a build that feels right.  This build is for the Endless Nights VI mod by “Havlen” (played offline, so all PvM), it is a fairly low to medium magic world with a lot of randomness.  One key thing is that if my character dies… well he is dead, no extra lives or anything; so survivability is important.  I really like the “Dragon Kin” from Biowares Epic Character Builds, but it looks rather hard to survive and play from 1-40, and I am not sure what feats to get instead of all the Great Wisdom’s.<br><br>Some conditions or things at least that are important to me:<br><br>Race:<br>-Elf<br>- or Half Elf<br><br>Classes:<br>-Druid (14 or the lowest level ideally for Dragon Shape)<br>-Monk (not to high)<br>- ______ (I like the idea of having arcane magic)<br><br><br><br>I will admit here and now that I will be changing my stats at L1, using the DebugMode; I know I know its “cheating” <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">   but its my game and I will enjoy this (no offence to anyone) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">   .<br><br><br><br>Stats (something like) :<br>-Strength 14-18<br><br>-Dexterity 20 (Elf or Half Elf)<br><br>-Constitution 20<br><br>-Intelligence X<br><br>-Wisdom 20-25<br>------Really high Wisdom I know, but this is a hard modual and death is permanent unless I re-load and I don’t want to do that.  Also I want to get Dragon Shape as soon as I can, so I can actually play through a good portion of the game with it!  Or at least having it available. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>-Cha X<br><br>As far as Magic items and traps go (copyed and pasted from the Readme):<br>“MAGIC ITEMS AND TREASURE<br><br>The game uses a combination of a dynamic magic item system which builds magic items from the ground up and random magic item tables that contain static magic items.  In both cases, the magic items are often tailored to the class and level of the character, though sometimes they are tailored to the class and level of the creature that must be fought to obtain the item.<br><br>Due to the dynamic nature of the theme, the level of magic in the world may fluctuated from game to game.  The vast majority of the time the game will issue out items at a low-to-medium rate, but sometimes the game will increase the chances of generating an item, and rarely, but possible, it will generate an wildly random item not based on the level of the character/creature.<br><br>TRAPS, LOCKS, AND SPECIAL EVENTS<br><br>The game utilizes the newly released feature to dynamically spawn traps.  Containers and Doors may be locked and trapped as well as floors generating traps.  These traps are slightly more common when playing with a rogue character.<br><br>The game also features some special events that may have strange results on the character.  Some of these events can, in rare cases, drastically shift the power of the character on a permanent bases, while more commonly they just add a bonus, or provide a penalty, for a temporary period of time.”<br><br>I am would greatly appreciate positive feedback, ideas and builds.<br><br>Thank you,<br>-Daniel<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By who_is_daniel on 07/14/06 15:31</span></i></p>

First of all, too bad you want to change your stats, you're skipping the challenge with it, just wanting to have Dragon Shape earlier doesn't means you should, pre-requisites are there for something.<br><br>Now, you can do whatever you like anyway, but I will suggest builds taking only the legal part in account, which is enough if you ask me.<br><br>First of all, your specifics baffle me, why Elf or half-elf? human is the best class for a shifting build because you lose pretty much everything when you shift, so less XP penalty, 1 feat and more skills are more valuable than any other class except your class requires a specific race, which is not the case.<br><br>Second, after shifting your stats get rearranged, so why do you even need to change your stats with DebugMode? you get shapeshift since druid level 5, and a Druid5/Monk1 is one of the most playable builds when you're low level, you get dragon shift late in the game because you don't need it. I recommend taking more than 16 druid levels to get elemental forms, or 20 for improved elemental forms, they make the leveling much easier, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "244978", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>this</a> my build based on it. I still can't believe you need to cheat the game, you just need more practice.<br><br>Cleric is a great buffing class, and should do well for the third class, since Divine Power will really make you get use of the last APR, among with several others, check <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225446", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>this</a> for a powerful cleric dragon build.<br><br>There are so many other types of build, why closing yourself to dragons, which are hard to achieve and not often very playable?<br><br>Note that I only try to help you because I know there is no use of cheating, and try to enlighten you about it, if you need cheats is because you're unexperienced, that's all, do not expect many suggestions after you admited you will cheat, as we do not approve it.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/14/06 21:31</span></i></p>
