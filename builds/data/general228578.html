At one time, the guild attempted to get one going, but I don't think it is up anymore.  I test all of my builds on The Novice to Epic Character Builder.  This is a really good mod, that lets you level, buy any equipment you need, then test your build against both adventurers and monsters.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

True on the AI for the most part.  I mainly use Prismatic Dragon as a test.  You could also host that mod online and get a friend or 2 to sign in and go PvP.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.
