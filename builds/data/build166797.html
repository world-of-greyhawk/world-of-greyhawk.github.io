Although it's possible to avoid an XP penalty with this build, it seems like it would be a bit of a pain.  It would be much easier if the race were Human or Halfling, as Elf's Favored Enemy is Wizard, which is not taken at all in this build.  <br><br>Halfling would give you +1 to AB and AC vs. larger creatures due to the Small Stature feat, and you also wouldn't take a hit to your Con.  You would also get +4 to Hide and Move Silently, which doesn't hurt either.  <br><br>The only thing you really lose by not going Elven would be the Keen Sense feat, which I admit is nice.

Even if you went Halfling, it's still difficult to eliminate the experience penalty. You'd have to keep the Monk and Cleric classes within one level of each other, and as the build finishes Monk 12 / Cleric 15 / Rogue 13, that's not really feasible. Also, when fighting against creatures with slashing DR, it's nice to change to Monk fists for some bludgeoning damage. if you went Halfling, the build would be using a smaller damage die for unarmed attacks.<br><br>The +1 to AB and AC is always nice though, and I think it's much more feasible to play this build as a Halfling rather than Elf. It depends on where you're playing, I guess.

Nice build and good concept.<br><br>Thoughts:<br>1. Post your classes <i>and levels</i> in the topic title please.<br>2. Have you looked at replacing rogue with Assassin? That would relieve some of the XP penalty concern. You could go alternate Monk and Cleric until you had Hide and Move Silently at 8, then start taking Assassin levels to beef up your roguish side. There are downsides to this of course (fewer skill points, loss of bonus rogue feats, need to be Evil,...) Maybe something to think about though.<br><br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br>Check out the Epic Character Builders Guild<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Test your new builds in this mod:<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/modules/data/1073117317280.shtml" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

Assassins cant get defensive roll , this loses Epic Dodge. Quite a big loss IMO.<br><br>Syrath

Ack, I wouldn't take Animal for a build like this. If you really want Cat's Grace, go for War and pick up Aura of Vitality too. IIRC True Seeing is a level 5 cleric spell, and there are very few other good ones anyway, so it's not like he'll run out of level 5 slots. <br><br>Or, if you're not too fussed about Cat's Grace, go for Magic domain and get Stoneskin and Ice Storm.
