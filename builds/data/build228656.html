A build I've had sitting in the stable for a while. Never got around to posting it, but having played it for a while recently, I thought I'd post him. I found it  quite effective and really good fun.

Seeing it is a strength build, I think you're going to take Heavy Armor &amp; Shield, ie 95% Arcana Spell Failure..<br><br>What will be his main spells he's going to use?

He has some fairly useful spells for buffing and defense available.

Personally, I think the lack of spell power hurts this build a lot.  I'd go Ftr 10/wizard 23/wm 7 and be able to fight like a spell-sword should.  Fully buffed up with auto-still 3 and casting shields and then tensoring.<br><br>But that's just me.  I can use potions for most of the lower wiz spells so could take some more ftr or wm if I wanted that.<br><br>-pc

The intent is a 'spellsword' that's focussed on melee, not a caster that can do a bit of fighting. Besides, this one's a bit different than other FTR/WM/WIZ builds in the guild.

I wonder the difference in the fully buffed AB of the two builds.  Plus you'll have to realy on someone to buff your weapon, etc.  Gotta love having cleric friends <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>A tensored f/w/wm can get pretty high AB.  But as you suggest, there are other builds posted for that.  This one focuses on melee only and has up to level 5 spells.  I guess I just feel that if you are going to buff yourself, then you gotta do a better job then that.  But if you play on a world with high magic items (+5 or better weapons, etc) then you don't need more levels.  You'll just use items to compensate.<br><br>-pc
