Gate Guard: "Halt stranger, what is your business here?"<br>Stranger: "I'm just passing by on my way to Marshtown, a drink would suit me well."<br>Gate Guard: "Very well, the pub is straight by this street, move along."<br><br>The stranger walked through the city amazed -"What a quiet nice town... oddly quiet, with a guard in every corner...", he entered the pub, which was as quiet as the town...<br><br>Bartender: "Hmmm, a stranger, what will ya be havin'?"<br>Stranger: "Your cheapest ale."<br>Bartender: "Hah, some Fire Wine for the smart guy, four gold pieces."<br>Stranger: "Why's this town so calmed and quiet?"<br>Drunken Mercenary: "Who asks?"<br>Stranger: "I'm Colthonir, Knight of Lathander."<br>Drunken Mercenary: "Did you not see the guards in your way here? *hic*, there is one in every corner."<br>Colthonir: "Why is that?"<br>Bartender: "Simple, the king has the town guarded, to keep us under the line."<br>Colthonir: "Any reason?"<br>Bartender: "Look, if you wish to know I'll tell ya, but it's not your problem man."<br>Colthonir: "Perhaps I can be of assistance."<br>Bartender: "Hah, alright then, this is what happened:<br><br>About two years ago, this man came to town, a powerful sorcerer looking for power, Murkul be his name, he came here because he learned the rumor that the king owned a powerful spell, which he sought to become more powerful.<br>Murkul is nothing but evil, when he requested the scroll from His Majesty, the access was obviously denied, so he killed the king, many guards died that day, but nothing they could do to stop him, at the end, the surviving guards pledged loyalty to Murkul in fear.<br>Mukrul defiled the treasury and obtained the scroll, known as "Spell Trigger", only a high level sorcerer could use such a crazy spell, it is said that its effect stores three spells, allowing the owner to cast three times as fast, he feels invincible now, and decided to stay as our king; malicious he is, treating us like slaves, I do not know what else he wants from us, but our attempts to overthrow him have failed pitifuly, his power has no match."<br><br>Colthonir: "Hmmm, I will look into it."<br>Bartender: "I wish you luck kid, but don't do anything stupid, Murkul spends all day in the castle reading some ancient books or something."<br><br>Colthonir made his way to the castle, in an attempt to speak with this Murkul, a guard stopped him at the entrance of the castle -"None can enter without being sumoned by The Master."<br>Colthonir: "Nevertheless, I must speak to him."<br>Guard: "Forget it fool, if you want to pass you'll meet my blade."<br>Colthonir: "Step aside: Great Thunderclap!"<br>-The guard fell to the ground, paralized by the shock<br><br>Colthonir walked into the castle, it wasn't big, a side door lead to the Barracks, and the Main Hall was immediately in front of the entrance, there were five armored guards at each side of the hall, surrounding whomever enters.<br><br>Murkul: "Who disturbs?"<br>Colthonir: "I am Colthonir, Knight of Lathander."<br>Murkul: "Reason to be here?"<br>Colthonir: "As a servant of good, I will not allow a tyrant to enslave this town."<br>Mukul: "Useless threats, guards, take him away"<br><br>The guards draw their weapons, but before they could run against Colthonir, he hit the ground with his fist, as he casted -"Earthquake", all the guards fell to the ground with the powerful shake, the whole city awoke with the tremor, but Murkul, who was sitting on the throne, felt no damage.<br><br>Murkul: "So, the little knight has some tricks after all, very well, if you wish to die by me, feel my impressive Spell Trigger: Mordenkainen's Force Missiles!"<br><br>A storm of 21 missiles swarmed towards Colthonir, he attempted to cover, but his armor and shield had no effect against the exploding magic balls, who harmed him badly, making him kneel.<br><br>Colthonir: "Ungh..."<br>Mukrul: "As expected, finish him!"<br><br>The guards stand, passing the effect of the earthquake and ran against Colthonir, decided to kill, but he was already casting another spell...<br><br>Cothonir:<br>"The birds stopped singing,<br>the rivers stopped flowing,<br>the stars stopped shining,<br>the wind stopped blowing."<br><br>Matter itself contained with energy, as the universe stands still, Time Stop, only Colthonir left to move. With his remaining strengths, he walked towards Murkul, and stabbed his throat with his rapier, and just as the effect faded, Murkul fell dead.<br><br>Guard: "What the...?"<br>Colthonir: "The king is dead."<br>Guard: "So, has it ended?"<br>Colthonir: "That depends on you, Lathander has smiled upon you this day, do not waste it.", as he healed himself with a spell.<br>Guard: "But who will rule now?"<br>Colthonir: "That depends on you, today, the city and its people are free."<br><br>Then he casted another spell, and vanished...<br><br>Bards would make stories of his deeds, but that was surely not the end of him, much more would be heard of Colthonir, the Arcane Knight of Lathander.<br><br>------------<br><br><b>Arcane Knight of Lathander (Fighter 6 / Cleric 16 / Wizard 18)</b><br><br>This build is made out of several sources, initially from Melissan from Baldur's Gate 2, as an impressive melee that could cast Time Stop and Storm of Vengeance, some references to other Cleric/Wizard builds like <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "214402", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Red Mage!!

Oh, it seems playable indeed.

This is one of the better Cleric/Wizards I've seen.  I'm impressed that you managed a 26 strength.  I've tried a cleric/wizard a couple of times but I always ran into trouble with the int, wis and dex or str reqs.  This version balances them nicely.  But Lathander?!? Why not Azuth or Dugmaren?<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/06/06 16:10:30 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br>1 Cleric1 - Domains: Plant and War, Toughness<br>2 Cleric2<br>3 Cleric3 - Weapon Focus: Rapier<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Don't you need a martial weapon proficiency to use a rapier?<br><br>Also no still spell?

Start with a level of fighter, and you'll solve your Rapier problem. Go with scimitar to get use for the keen edge spell.<br><br>As for DP, now your 4th attack is at -15 and will hit nada anyway.

Well, I didn't really noticed I gain the Cleric before the WIS... of course, which such a simple change as switching Wizard to 19 will comppensate it, it has no real use in any case, because 1 Wizard earlier will not give me any real buffs, unless you plan on spamming ultra-low duration level 1 buffs such as true strike, other than that, Cleric gains more HP than Wizard <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   still, good observation, and very valid point, not sure if I will bother a mod for such a little difference...<br><br>In-action tweaking refers to: you are already buffed, as you used divine buffs normally and arcane buffs in a previous place with your armor off, if by any means your melee is not working on the given fight (although that would be extreme and you're dead anyway), you <i>can</i> take your armor off (although not on again while in combat) for offensive casting. Yeah, probably not a very wise choice... comes useful against those impossible to hit ACs.<br>I might need to use him and combat in every situation to know if offensive casting is really worth it, remember most of my slots are already taken by the current metamagics, slots is his main problem (other than time buffing of course).<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Well done Thax!
