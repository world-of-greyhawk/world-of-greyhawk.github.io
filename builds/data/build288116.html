This is my first attemp, albeit after heavey studying and consideration. I've checked the CBC and yes, of course this combination pops up a few times but I would like to think that this is the only Ro/F/SD combo that has this many feats, EWS in 2 weapons, has Epic dodge, has IKD, IC in 2 weapons, and SCII. Like I said though, this is my first build post and the point of me posting is for any help that might be available. My goal was for a decent build that could hold his own and still maintain a bit of a RP angle. This is supposed to be a semi-traditional rogue/Mercenary/bounty hounter. Sort of a sneaker, but not, if that makes any sense.

It's a nice build, but I would make some changes. <br>First off, drop Heavy Crossbow and all the feats related to it. It is one of the worst weapons in the game. Take Blind Fight and Toughness, maybe Expertise or the Initiative feats for example. Also, take Weapon Finesse as soon as you can (level 2) to increase playability.<br><br>Drop the SC feats. 20% is not much, and it is even less when you are facing enemies with Blind Fight (4% IIRC). As a rule of thumb, only SCV is useful.<br><br>You are ending with a 31 DEX. Try getting it to an even number, possibly replacing the SC feats with Great Dexterity.<br><br>With all those feats available, I'd consider ESF: Discipline.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By rafa10pj on 12/06/07 10:59</span></i></p>

Next patch fixes the issue with rapid reload.

Thanks for the suggestions rafa. I wasn't aware of the crossbow problems, although Deltutammatre says that a fix is forthcoming. SC I and II do seems a waste if that is the case and Blindfight would seem to be a must! <br><br>Thanks again.

rafa: Thanks for the suggestions. Dropping SC and picking up 2 more Dexs improved my AC, and AB. Also improved H,MS,OL,ST,and T skills. I also grabbed Blind Fight and moved Crippling Strike up and took it at lvl 23.

Upon further revue this build looks a lot like Mith's Percussion and Strings build. Sorry Mith, not intended. Didn't do enough searching I guess.

Its not much, but ranged and melee AB should be the same as long as you don't dual wield.<br><br>The EP bonus works even if it does'nt always show in the character sheet with ranged weapons.<br><br>I havent seen Miths build, but this one sure seems interesting.
