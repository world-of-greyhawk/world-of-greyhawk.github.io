Looking to create a nasty ac tank, that has a decent hitting ability (what good is it to get into a game of natural 20's just to hit your foe? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  )

my best bet would be a bard/WM/PM.<br>Max bard song for the full effects of the song, get imunne to crits and AC from PM, take advantage of WM AB bonus to a certain weapon. Bard spells would do a great bit to harden your combat ability and you will have a decent amount of HPs. <br>I don't know if it is the best, but it would be a tough one to beat certainly.

Not sure how the WM helps with the ac tho; it would help alot with the hitting part.  I'd say hitting is second priority (can't be ignored tho); this just seems not quite what I need.  <br>I'd want good versatility with the weapon, as a wide variety of weapons can be found, some of a very specific type has very high stats - so I'd want to be able to swap weapons as I please with little or no impact (weapon focus, even epic weapon focus is little impact when considering a +4 focus weapon vs a +8 non-focus weapon with better stats).<br><br>A naked ac of around 50 with the ability to wear heavy armor on top of it would be better than what I am currently considering (a naked unbuffed ac of 40 is the current blend I have), which is a blend of Bard, pm and RDD (thanks to paledrake) it just does not have much to offer in the hitting quarter (+45 will hit a lot of things, but will slide off about 25% of the bosses on the pw I play on - these being the ones that drop the good stuff <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  ).<br><br>So; any other guidelines?  Something with heavy armor that has very high ac, and better than +45 bab?<br><br>Ok, I'm rambling sorry.  Hope that is still loose enough for someone to help with this?

Your best bet for high AC and AB is a PM/AA combo.  You can go either Bard or Wizard, although Bard is probably the better choice.  Try Bard 15/PM 16/AA 9, or something along those lines.  You should be able to get at least one Epic spell and maybe two, and of course you'll have some spells as well as Bard Song to boost your AB and AC.
