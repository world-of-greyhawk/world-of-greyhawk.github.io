Robbing from the rich, giving to the poor, and inspiring the Merry Band PvM (1-40) and PvP<br><br>Sherwood Blade (“Wildwood Minstrel”)<br>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar (with shared credits)<br><br>Credits:<br>This build is part of the Robin Hood series, and has been revised in accordance with comments by Tatooed Monk (who deserves half the credit for this build, on account of his suggestions of an earlier build, and kind review of a draft of this particular character; I would also like to thank Dwarflord, for his comments on the original incantation also, as well as Grim, not only for his kind comments, but also his extensive knowledge of historical weapons, too. In other words, this build grew out of an earlier version, since re-dubbed for another legendary member of the “merry men” so that Alan O’ Dale here could stand out as a minstrel proper, since he was the lovable, well-known entertainer of Robin Hood and his group, and we needed to do him up RP-wise proper); for more about Alan and the forest clan group (as fictionalized), please see: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "270516", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> To see all the great comments which led to this build, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "270516", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> <br><br>Other builds:<br>While there be a gazillion Bard/Ranger builds here, this one (according to the pulse cap) seems to be the very first to combine epic ranger (hence, bane, covering off all 7 player races) with mid-level bard; thus proving, once again, the incredible power of the ranger class (which Robin and pretty much the entire “merry men” band were, too --  and all the good works they were able to do, as a result of being inspired by a talented bard, as Alan was). As such, this build is dedicated to the memory (as fictionalized) of Alan O Dale, also known as Alan A Dale, and the entertainer of the group.  <br> <br><br>The Build:<br>Hence, the class combination, effective RP-wise, and build-wise, too: this be a high ranger w. early bane, such that all playable races are covered off, w. a very good/high AB, thanks to bane and mid-level bard (lingering bard song/curse song and innate casting, plus full UMD, too); also, good HPs and good AC, with a nice skillset, too. The main drawback of this build is that your your bard spells (but not ranger spells) are vulnerable to dispelling, but so what: they add a lot of flavor/versatility/power to this build, while at the same time. covering off just about everything, including defense: i.e., AC and saves (which saves otherwise could be a problem). That said, while magic access and song/curse indeed be very nice, with natural AB 46 (bane), and bane's output on damage alone, this Minstrel is by no means buff-dependent (although, that also said, having buffs, song/curse at his ready disposal likewise means he’s not equipment dependent either, hence doesn't suffer from typical melee'r weaknesses); in other words, this combo makes for a very solid warrior, as an epic ranger enjoying all the benefits of the mid-level bard (or, is that bard enjoying all the benefits of ranger); as such, not only is he true to the legends re: Alan A (O) Dale, but he shines PvM, and is also very solid PvP, holding his own in hand-to-hand combat, and dishes/sings on behalf of any party (including Robin’s).
