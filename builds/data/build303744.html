Mick, I quite like this.  Fighter heavy, but I like it.  He takes feats that makes him lethal in Epic.  Good skill set, decent saves, has a variety of tools in his toolkit.  WS/EWS/Dev Crit in a ranged and melee weapon.  The ideal soldier.  Well done.  I'm on the fence about Knockdown though, and was wondering if Called Shot wouldn't be a better choice in this one, but I think you're good either way.  KD for his solid melee approach, or Called Shot when working off of strings.  Irony's a cruel mistress when she lets you take 20 Fighter levels and you're still short on feats. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Thanks to everybody for the positive feedback! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br><b>@ Grizzled_dwarflord:</b> Irony, indeed. With 20 Fighter levels I still have a list of feats I want in <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  , but there is not room for more fighter if I want the ranged AB up to par with melee AB. <br>I guess I could have squeezed in one more feat if I had taken 3 Bard lvls and 2 more fighter lvls. But I want the build to be played from lvl 1 - 40 without too long between skilldumps.<br>KD vs Called is a matter of taste and with my style of play I prefer KD if I have to choose. <br><br><b>@ Cinnabar Dinn:</b> For some reason your Devastator build didn't show up on the search. It clearly deserves mentioning. It is a strong and dangerous build. Your approach is a bit different and more geared towards archery than mine. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

I don't know exactly how the searcher Pulse Cap made works either, but it seems it doesn't follow the latest update in the index Bromium did. I have old builds that still don't show up in the searcher but I've checked and they are on the index. Try finding the Devastator as well, it is there, so don't blame the index so much. Manually searching the index can be a pain though, but as far as I see, the searcher only finds stuff from before 2007 or so.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/12/08 17:16</span></i></p>

The discrepancy you are seeing with builds is because the search engine is tied to the original Index thread started by Anuis.  It was last updated around August of 07.  The two other Index threads, even though they are later, are not utilized with the Search Engine.  I noticed at the time that Bromium was creating new thread indexes, and I should have protested, but didn't because I was just happy that somebody was doing it all. <br><br>I've sent some feelers out to Pulse Cap, and I'm not sure if he's even around anymore, but I think that any future updates should be made in the original Index thread so that the Engine can find them.  I could possibly do something like this, but I would first need the senate to elect me the supreme chancellor and give me total control over the Republic and its armies (with the understanding that I would give it all back once peace was restored, of course).<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Making a strength based fighter able to handle melee and ranged equally well, is one of the things you can accomplish with the AA class. That was my focus here.<br><br>Maybe dev crit with two weapons is crazy.

Before we get way off topic.  It appears that tensers can allow you to qual for AA.  HOWEVER, if you are playing a PW, then NOPE, especially if Legal enforced chars (and who plays on any other type of server, from our guild anyway).  <br><br>So while the idea of Halforc AA is nice, it really has no business in the epic builds forums.
