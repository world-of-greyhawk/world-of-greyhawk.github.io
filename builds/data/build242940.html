Yet another great build from you, Finneous, even if you do have a ton of them. =P<br><br>I doubted the usefulness of ESF: Move Silently without the Hide counterpart, but then I remembered that your hide is going to be +10 over your MS due to spells, so it all evens out in the end.<br><br>I've also, interestingly enough, been wanting to give a dagger dual-wielder a shot.

I'm personally a huge fan of BoE, so that would definitely come first on my build. However, in general I think that Epic Dodge is probably the better choice, and as such if I were being logical I'd take that sooner (but, of course, I'm not a logical person). <br><br>And yeah, 15 Rogue and no Cripp is kinda disappointing, but in order to get what you've got you have to make sacrifices somewhere. I had a Ranger21/Monk9/Rogue 10 build that could have gone for lower Monk and managed Epic Dodge, but I wanted Cripp instead. Very hard to get both with less than 16 Rogue. =/

I might revise the build and post it at some point, sure, since you asked. It's a pretty standard build, though, and it's really not very special. It has pretty awful AB, but that's because I made it a halfling with Dual Kamas (yeah, stupid stupid move, I know...)<br><br>Anyway, once again great job, and I'll see about getting my own prepared so you can evaluate it.

The damage might well be a problem for awhile, though traps and animal companion can help some. Hm, early BoE might solve it a bit.

I like it.  You're a solid builder, so not much to add. I might drop called shot and/or improved expertise (It's hard to justify a -10 to Attack for a melee build unless you're a paladin or cleric, or locked in a roll a 20 battle) for blind-fight and maybe toughness.  Also, with the rogue levels and left over skill points, you might as well take more disable trap and some search.  Lastly, on your V 2 you might as well bump BoE to level 39 and move the fighter levels down lower to get the +6 to damage as soon as possible, which should help with playability a bit.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 06/06/06 11:26</span></i></p>
