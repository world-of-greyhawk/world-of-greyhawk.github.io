I'd like to make an epic Blackguard and I'd really could use some advice... I like the infernal warrior build, but I was wondering about some stuff.. mostly about str, I think I waould have just let that at 14 and about the extra smiting/great smite feats. Anyway, anyone who thinks he has a good Fallen palladin-Blackgurd build, could post it here. It would be really helpfull... Thanx in advance!<br>_________________<br>The past is a ghost that haunts you, from the moment it exists, until the moment you don't...

Well I got this idea.. How about that: <br><br>You start with str 14 con 14 dex 10 int 14 wis 8 cha 16. <br><br>You get first lvl as rogue. At the end the multiclassing is like that: rogue 9 paladin 3 blackguard 28. <br><br>The feats I get are these(I might forget something..) : power attack, cleave, toughness, weapon focus longsword, knockdown, impr knockdown, blind fight, divine might, divine shield, extra turning, improved critical, great cha I, great cha II, armor skin, epic weapon focus longsword, epic fiendish servant, epic prowress(not so sure about that..), impr sneak attack I, impr sneak attack II, impr sneak attack III, impr sneak attack IV<br><br>All the extra ability points go into cha, that in the end becomes 28<br><br>As you can see, I haven't taken any smiting feats in this build, as they would only be usefull in PvP(though I could easily take them instead of blind fight and epic prowress)... As for the skill points, at the lvl 40 you have 282 points, if we put aside the 5 that are needed in the hide skill. What is absolutely certain is that tumble will get 40 points and discipline will be maxed.. That leaves us with 199 points... What should I do with these?? The skills I have in mind are: heal(I like it..), use magic device, persuade, taunt, search, spot... I don't know, just tell me what skills would be good... <br><br>As you can understad it isn't a stealthy build, it's a warrior with full plate etc... I've taken the rogue to maximize tumble for the bonus AC, for the extra 5d6 sneak damage I get from 9 rogue levels, for dodge feat and for the skills.. It is somehow more defensive than the ftr/pal/bg build, since it doesn't get the weapon specialisation(and the epic) and the smiting abilities, though it get the extra sneak damage, and more AC. Which do you think is better?? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">     <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">     <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">     Anyway, I'm waiting your advice and opinions...... Mainly for skills... And for feats of course...<br>_________________<br>The past is a ghost that haunts you, from the moment it exists, until the moment you don't...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By LordMaldazzar on 11/19/04 19:39</span></i></p>
