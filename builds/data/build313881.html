As impossible as it sounds, I haven't seen this combination of classes at all so far, so here is a first attempt.<br><br>The general idea of this character is a charming spy/thief/assassin who can still be mighty in a one-on-one confrontation against all but the most determined foes.<br><br><b>Description</b><br>Maliciously endearing. Wickedness pouring from behind a dry smile wrought with painfully curled lips. <br><br><b>Biography</b><br>Not with comfort do I recall my early days. My sleep more bereft of restfulness than the black wastelands of my first home are lacking of warmth. Tormented by a hated consience that I attack each day, only to have it gnaw at me again, compounded further by the failed attempts at moral suicide. <br><br>Among what parallels for gentry in the upper circles of dark society I was born, and taught my first lessons. Coarse blood, cold bones, and calm skin. And then nothing.<br><br>In grand Neverwinter are my second first memories. As if born again I found myself in the service of the Kingdom, instilled with the virtues and principles of a noble God; a blinding righteousness to pierce the dead emptiness of a heart afore-unused. All memories of the previous darkness were nothing more than a shadowy dream unheeded. <br><br>There I served faithfully, if faithfulness is a borrowed skin that may be shed, until the dread vision came to me. Of this I will not speak, but to say that the mark of Bane is a binding tie, and in one lifetime unquenched. My past was not unpainfully restored to me, my present now more the dream, and my purpose in part revealed. <br><br>The shadows are mine to pave, the walls bear my ears, the vaults hide my prints, what is missed has found my fingers, and those who are missed have found my wrath. The God that holds a purchase, however small on my heart is heedless of the one that blackens my blood. Twice blessed and cursed is the agent that serves two sides but cannot choose one, and more than death lies in the middle.<br> <br><br><b>Double Agent</b><br>Paladin(16), Rogue(22), Blackguard(2)<br>Human, PvM<br>Playable 1-40 but more useful from ~Level 9<br>Lawful Evil<br>Deities: Bane &amp; Torm (Enemies yes, but it works for this particular RP backstory <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   )<br><br><b>Abilities</b><br>STR: 13<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 8<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 12<br>CHA: 17 (30)<br><br><b>Level Guide</b><br>01: Paladin(1): Toughness, Blind Fight<br>02: Paladin(2): {Smite Evil}<br>03: Paladin(3): Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>04: Paladin(4): CHA+1, (CHA=18)<br>05: Paladin(5)<br>06: Paladin(6): Power Attack<br>07: Rogue(1)<br>08: Paladin(7): CHA+1, (CHA=19)<br>09: Paladin(8): Divine Might<br>10: Paladin(9)<br>11: Paladin(10)<br>12: Rogue(2): CHA+1, Improved Critical: Scimitar, {Evasion}, (CHA=20)<br>13: Paladin(11)<br>14: Paladin(12)<br>15: Paladin(13): Divine Shield<br>16: Paladin(14): CHA+1, (CHA=21)<br>17: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>18: Paladin(15): Cleave<br>19: Blackguard(1): *Alignment Change*<br>20: Blackguard(2): CHA+1, {Smite Good}, (CHA=22)<br>21: Rogue(4): Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>22: Rogue(5)<br>23: Rogue(6)<br>24: Rogue(7): CHA+1, Epic Prowess, (CHA=23)<br>25: Rogue(8)<br>26: Rogue(9)<br>27: Rogue(10): Armor Skin, Improved Evasion<br>28: Rogue(11): CHA+1, (CHA=24)<br>29: Rogue(12)<br>30: Rogue(13): Great Charisma I, Crippling Strike, (CHA=25)<br>31: Rogue(14)<br>32: Rogue(15): CHA+1, (CHA=26)<br>33: Rogue(16): Great Charisma II, Improved Sneak Attack I, (CHA=27)<br>34: Rogue(17)<br>35: Rogue(18)<br>36: Rogue(19): CHA+1, Improved Sneak Attack II, Improved Sneak Attack III, (CHA=28)<br>37: Rogue(20)<br>38: Rogue(21)<br>39: Paladin(16): Great Charisma III, (CHA=29), *Alignment Change*<br>40: Rogue(22): CHA+1, (CHA=30)<br><br><b>Stats</b><br>Hitpoints: 312<br>Skillpoints: 304<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 42/38/38<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Traps: +5<br>BAB: 29<br>AB (max, naked): 34 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 20/31<br>Spell Casting: Paladin(4)<br>Alignment Changes: 2<br><br><b>Skills</b><br>Discipline 42(43), Hide 43(43), Move Silently 43(43), Open Lock 43(43), Persuade 43(53), Pick Pocket 43(43), Tumble 43(43), UMD 4(14)<br><br>Put skills on wherever you can, but favour Persuade and Tumble over the sneaky skills whilst you are still pre-epic.<br><br>*Note Please - This is my first time trying out the CBC so if anything is not quite right, please let me know.*<br><br>Built mostly for RP goodness and apparent uniqueness, this character can still hold his/her own in a dungeon of your choosing.<br><br><b>The Good</b><br>Decent sneak attack.<br>High saves.<br>Very decent buffed damage (Bulls Strength, Eagles Splendour, Aura of Glory, Divine Might &amp; Shield)<br>Buffed AC is pretty good.<br>The complete sneaky skill set.<br><br><b>The Bad</b><br>Low hitpoints<br>Mediocre unbuffed AC<br>Mediocre unbuffed AB<br><br><b>The Ugly</b><br>There are two alignment changes.

WHAT!  Why do you need 2 alignment changes for a DIs dump, when BG gets dis?  It makes me VERY nervous about your abilities when you make suggestions like this...  <br><br>Also, 2 BF?  WHAT!  There are a few PRC that give nice bonus for 2 lvls, but BG ISNT one of them!  This makes no sense to me, but what do I know.  After all, i was told that the game has changed so much.  Whats next?

I should have thought of that. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br>I assume that by "BF" you meant "BG", of which 2 levels gives you dark blessing.

You invest in 2 alignment changes, which is ALOT, seeing that some pws dont allow them for balance reasons.  ANyway, the ONLY reason for taking BG is for the exploit of 2 times the charisma bonus to saves.  THat isnt new.  And by commitment, i refered to the fact that you invested all the energy to switch to evil, for 2 lvls.  That is not a commitment.

A lawful Paladin pickpocket - I don't think I've seen that before!<br><br>The saves are very good and so is the AC with DS up.<br>The character has several ways of dealing massive damage, especially DM and SA, but also GMW and DF.<br><br>The AB on the other hand is really too low to make this anything but a mob killer. You can increase the AB with +10 from GMW and DF giving +44, which is par with a normal fighter in mundane gear. But you will need a +6 weapon <i>and DF</i> to match the fighter if he gets a +1 weapon, and DF only lasts one turn. And the buffs count towards the +20 cap.<br>Ok, you can self buff with Bull's too, but it doesn't solve the problem, and adds nothing to AB if potions of Bull's are ready available in the mod.<br>Taking the Taunt skill will help some, but the AB will still be low.<br><br>I also miss Knockdown in the build. You invest a lot in SA and it would be great to be able to score repeated SAs against a prone enemy.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

But that comment about you only looking for killer builds is arguable. The reason being is that I've seen you comment quite favourably towards builds that have little to no real power in melee or magic and were not designed to. Unless by KILLER you just meant "really good for what it is", and by pansies you meant the opposite.<br><br>My point is that lately you seem to be on a very short fuse avado, and I don't think it was always like that. I appreciate your critisicm, as even if it does come with insults and chides it still helps.<br><br>Anyway, at the least you've given me something to do. I'm off to make a wizard20/rog18/wm2 build. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br><i>Aunty's wooden leg, aunty's wooden leg.<br>We'll paint it red and call it Fred or Ned or Ted.<br>Oh aunty's wooden leg, aunty's wooden leg.<br>Everybody said it was well and truly dead!</i>

I totally agree with Kail, thanks... The idea is to not as much as call someone a moron for something like using only two levels of Weapon Master, but to point out the advantages of taking it to the seventh level for all the juicy bonuses it offers. <br><br>This is the point of constructive criticism and why people who submit builds here ask for advice.<br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.
