You can raise them with items and/or buffs to even them out, but since the max stat boost possible is +12, that would leave you on an odd number if you maxed the stat boost, which is a waste of points.<br><br>Example: your build has 17 STR. If you cast Bull's STR, you'll get +2 to +5 points in STR added to that. Assume you get the max of +5. That puts your STR at 22. Very nice. Now let's assume you get a combination of buffs and items that raise STR by +12 (the maximum possible). Suddenly your STR is topped out at 29, which is no better than 28, so basically, you have a 'wasted' STR point. It's more efficient to end your stats on an even number if at all possible.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I like paladin/cot builds and I like clerics, so this is a build that I like.  But I wouldn't post if that is all I had to say.  I think I would take 12 levels of CoT pre-epic for the AB (or as many as you can within build parameters.  If being level 26 cleric matters to you, take 8 CoT levels pre-epic.).  A level 17 cleric gets level 9 spells.  If you went Cleric 18/CoT 18, you'd get two bonus feats from the CoT (of course, you'd lose your Cleric bonus feats) and you'd have +4 to all saves while still having level 9 spells (no epic, though).  I am not necessarily recommending that, but you do have to play around with the numbers, level it up and see what it does.  For example, Cleric 22/Cot 14 gets you the CoT bonus feat, +2 to all saves, and level 9 spells and epic spells, depending on when you took the cleric levels.<br><br>Cheers.

Secondly, it looks to me like all the feats taken in epic levels are epic feats, so for every two levels of CoT moved pre-epic you would have to drop an epic feat and select a weaker one instead.
