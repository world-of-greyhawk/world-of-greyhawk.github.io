Hiya,<br><br>I was trying out a build in the Novice to Epic mod today, but I couldn't get the desired results. <br><br>I don't necessarily want a critique of my build idea or anything like that, what I'd really like to know is why my Monk 9/Fighter 9/Wizard 22 never was able to get epic spells?<br><br>He had Intelligence of 20, spellcraft of 40 and was leveled up kind of like this:<br>Char. Level:<br>1-16 - Monk 1-8 mixed with Fighter 1-8<br>17-20 - 4 levels of wizard<br>21 -&gt; pretty much wizard all the way to character level 36, then fighter 9 and monk 9 to max discipline and tumble.<br>Then I figured I could take wizard levels 20, 21, and 22 at 38, 39, and 40 and pick up one or two epic spells. But they never showed up as available. I even rolled his levels back down to 30, then went straight wizard all the way to 40. Still never saw Epic Spell as a selectable feat. <br><br>Like I said, he had 5 or 6 9th level spells, Int. of 20, and Spellcraft and Concentration of 40+.<br><br>What I am I forgetting? Why couldn't I get Epic Spells?<br><br>Thanks.<br>Kaliban

Thanks but no - starting as a wizard didn't help either. I think I'm following what's outlined as need. This time, the character was Wizard 24/Fighter 8/Monk 8 so I think there should have been Epic Spells offered at some point.<br><br>Anyone else see what I'm missing?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban

I am not sure what is wrong... from what I see, you should be able to get it by now.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.

In order to qualify for an epic spell you need:<br>1) Able to cast lvl9 spells<br>2) That class with lvl9 spells MUST be lvl21+.  This is different to usual epic feats that just require you to be an epic _character_.<br><br>The above can be partly negated with sufficient Palemaster levels.<br><br>This could be where you were expecting a lot of epic spells after _character_ lvl21.  I think you can plan it so you will get one epic spell with wiz22; but I'm not sure of the feat progression.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 11/27/04 17:33</span></i></p>

Also you have to make sure that you have a high enough spellcraft skill. Every epic spell has a certain amount of spellcraft required for you to be able to pick it.

Thanks guys. I think if you read my original post that I have all the required specs: wizard level 19 on up to 24, spellcraft of 40, and thus the ability to have 4 or 5 level 9 spells. <br><br>As far as I can see, I should then be able to get Epic Spells.<br><br>Today for kicks (and to make sure I am not insane), I built the Enchanted Sorceress thinking this way I could see Epic Spells be chosen. Well, when my sorceress reached the appropriate levels, those feats were NOT available. So....I think my NWN install is somehow corrupted. I can take Epic Spells with a Palemaster build, but not with a sorc or wiz. Accordingly I uninstalled the PRC pack from my PC. I'll try later tonight to see if that fixes it. <br><br>Hmm. Have so much custom material in there that I'd hate to have to uninstall and reinstall NWN. Takes SO long. But I'll do that if needed of course.<br><br>I'll post here if I'm successful tonight.<br><br>Thanks again.<br>Kaliban

When you add any custom stuff.. you probably will want to do it manually. I never use the exe files because they have higher chances of being corrupted or get corrupted. So, when you take off all custom stuff.  Then put them back on, make sure that any exe's that you use, extract the files from that and manually put them into approriate places.<br><br>Just a suggestion.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.

That's a great suggestion.<br><br>So I redid my builds (after removing PRC) and it all worked out - epic spells showed up where expected:<br><br>I threw together two spellswords: One is Monk 9/Fighter 9/Wizard 22 (no epic spells), and the other is a Monk 9/Champion of Torm 8/Wizard 23 (with two epic spells). Both came out with 4 attacks per round, naked AC of 20-21, and 250-300 HP. AB on both (with mundane weapon of choice) is 34/29/24/19<br><br>The reason I was going monk was that I was envisioning a robe-wearing, speedy spellsword (instead of a plate-wearing tankish spellsword).<br><br>If anyone is interested I will post the full builds. I'm pretty sure there are better spellswords out there so I won't post mine unless asked.<br><br>Speaking of spellswords, I wonder if anyone has built a Bard/CoT/Sorc? I see some synergy there. Maybe I'll toy with that idea next.<br><br>Kaliban.
