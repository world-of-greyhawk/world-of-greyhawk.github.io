I've found a most excellent server, where parties is greatly needed. It is an action server with so many cool modifications and a unique setting. Check out their website and look at it. It is certainly good for alle players who needs new builds to create instead of the old stereotype ones. <br><br><a href="http://www.dormantwarrior.adsl24.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.dormantwarrior.adsl24.co.uk/</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Saints of Apocalypse on 09/29/07 15:36</span></i></p>

I have played at alot of servers in my day.  I found, at one time, Amon to be very solid (before they required a hak pak that I never got around to downloading).  Amon is about lv 40 chars (getting to lv 40 is relatively easy.  My dex cleric I posted soloed to 40 in about 3 weeks playin 3-4 times per week). I havent playd there in over 2 years though.<br><br>My current server, and one the only one I have playd on in the last year, Forgotten World. <a href="http://www.forgotten-worlds.net/nwn/news.php" target="_blank">http://www.forgotten-worlds.net/nwn/news.php</a>  <br><br>If you look through Bioware's Epic character page, quite a few of those builds were originally designed on this server (as i understand it!).  The server went to partial PRC about 1.5 yrs ago, so you would have to download that patch.   It is a tough ride to 40 (i havent leveled one to 40 yet.  closest is 32, the cleric i posted recently on PRC forum here). There are a few excellent builders roaming the server.  And, in my humble opinion, IF you have played nwn for some time, the PRC is a really refreshing bonus.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Everyone creates his own build to his own tastes all the time, except for PvP servers where you either take strong stereotypical builds that everybody knows of or die, just about in any PvM server you can make "new" builds whenever you want to, parties can make up for it if you're not using a powerbuild all the time, though I do.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Well IMHO I have never experienced such party-loving server before. I like the social bit of making parties <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> . Also the additional classes available, when you make unique class combinations are great fun. The server loves some pretty awesome spellswords like Bane Knight. The ever loveable combination (sorc/blackguard) to an extend, where you just lose it and say what!? I myself wanted to make a blackguard straight away, because they cut the class some slack and powered it to true strength and power, which suits the status of BG <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> . I am a lvl 25 Lash of Hatred, which makes unique use of the whip. Fun and very entertaining. '<br><br>I suggest this server to every player, who wants to make a character that is giving new abilites than prior and actually offers a lot fun time in an easy-to-get-going world <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

If your looking for a good server, that is easy to level, have active guilds and lots of + items.

That would be Athas Reborn in PWStory. It's based on 2'nd edition's Darksun setting. We got custom races like Thri-Kreen, Half-Giants, Pterrans and about 2 dozen more. All the items are custom, like bone and obsidian weapons. Lots and lots of tweaks went in for authenticity.

someone above mentioned our server forgotten worlds dragon mountian - an action pw. the website is <a href="http://www.forgotten-worlds.net." target="_blank">www.forgotten-worlds.net.</a><br><br>We have a very complex token system with millions of combinations. leveling is hard and tough, so getting to 40 is quite an accomplishment. The quest system is lengthy, but redundant as some people will comment, but it is an action server, so you have many (100's ) of kill quests with unique and challenging bosses every level from 5-40 (most levels have multiple bosses so you do not always face the same bosses with each char).<br><br>we have a partial prc implimentation. we have left off classes that we deemed to buggy or that cause excessive lag.  We have limited Pvp, guilds, rp and we are working on a capture the flag system. many folks have been here over 4 years. it is definatly a place to test your power builds, but be prepared to take some time to level.<br>_________________<br>no matter where you go, there you are!!!
