Is there a way to get more by exploit?<br><br>Someone said that the maximum amount of attacks is 18.<br><br>But I am not fully versed with all the exploits that may exist.<br><br>So instead of thinking that the guy is FOS, I came here to do research and ask questions.

Wrong. I believe the most attacks in the old days were 12 as a cleric/monk.

Thank you for all responses...<br><br>So the maximum number of attacks is 12.<br><br>So in addition, we are counting the cleave attack and the extra attack a cleric gets when it casts Divine Power?

No, the extra attack you get from Divine Power is the same one you get from having pre-epic BAB of 16.<br><br>Counting Great Cleave you can reach the 12, since Great Cleave allows whatever amount of enemies being hit, just for being Monk you already get Cleave, though I think you're at 11 APR with just the normal Cleave, but for practical purposes it's 10 because you can't use Cleave at will for extra hits, it works when it works.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.
