Here is a build that targets the Medusa form.  This build is intended to be a HIPSing Stone Gazer.  VERY handy when in a party.  This build does not rely on AB at all.  Stone gaze DC is low, but everyone rolls a one at some point.  HIPS is great for allowing you to get those gazes off first and jump back into the shadow later.<br><br><br>Druid(5), Shifter(16), Shadowdancer(19), Elf<br><br>STR: 8<br>DEX: 18 (26)<br>CON: 10 (12)<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 16<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 360<br>Skillpoints: 339<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 29/24/34<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +1, Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +2, Fear: +2<br>BAB: 23<br>AB (max, naked): 31 (melee), 31 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 28/32<br>Spell Casting: Druid(3)<br>Alignment Changes: 0<br><br>Animal Empathy 41(40), Concentration 41(42), Heal 27(29), Hide 43(61), Move Silently 43(61), Search 43(48), Spellcraft 5(8), Spot 43(59), Tumble 40(48)<br><br><br><br>01: Dr(1): Alertness<br>02: Dr(2)<br>03: Dr(3): Expertise<br>04: Dr(4): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br>05: Dr(5)<br>06: Sh(1): Improved Expertise<br>07: Sh(2)<br>08: Sh(3): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>09: Sh(4): Dodge<br>10: Sh(5)<br>11: Sh(6)<br>12: Sh(7): DEX+1, Mobility, (DEX=21)<br>13: Sh(8)<br>14: SD(1):<br>15: Sh(9): Great Fortitude<br>16: Sh(10): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>17: SD(2):<br>18: SD(3): Weapon Finesse<br>19: SD(4)<br>20: SD(5): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br>21: Sh(11): Armor Skin<br>22: SD(6)<br>23: SD(7):<br>24: SD(8): DEX+1, Epic Skill Focus: Spot, (DEX=24)<br>25: SD(9)<br>26: SD(10):<br>27: SD(11): Epic Will<br>28: Sh(12): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br>29: Sh(13): Epic Energy Resistance: Fire I<br>30: Sh(14): Epic Fortitude<br>31: Sh(15)<br>32: SD(12): CON+1, (CON=11)<br>33: SD(13): Epic Reflexes, Epic Dodge<br>34: SD(14)<br>35: SD(15)<br>36: SD(16): CON+1, Epic Energy Resistance: Fire II, Epic Skill Focus: Hide, (CON=12)<br>37: SD(17)<br>38: Sh(16): Epic Energy Resistance: Cold I<br>39: SD(18): Epic Energy Resistance: Cold II<br>40: SD(19): DEX+1, Epic Skill Focus: Move Silently, (DEX=26)<br><br>=======<br><br>Weapon finness was taken but can be substituted with anythign you want (probaby an initiative booster would be good).<br><br>Expertise was taken because I believe you can stone gaze or wyrmling breath while in expertise mode, if not, then replace those two feats.<br><br>Medusa form does reduce dex to 19 instead of 25/26.

Nice. Maybe a bit of a one-trick pony, but I like the creativity factor. Quite original. I have to say, there's some flair in a shadowy Medusa.<br><br>Think this one would be very good for PvP, but you failed to mention whether it was designed specifically for PvM/PvP. HiPS, stoning, ED, spot, all very nice qualities for a solid PvP character.<br><br>Not sure why you took so many SD levels. Sure, some for ED/HiPS, but don't know why you took so many <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif"> . Shadow evade? I'm sure this would benefit from some juicy druid spells, maybe in place of some of the SD levels (Unless I'm missing something... which I probably am!).<br><br>Maybe some RP value in this unique character, however, if it were to be RPed as a Medusa itself, rather than someone that shifts into one, it wouldn't be very easy considering you get it at level 16!<br><br>You: Hssss!<br>Person: Excuse me?<br>You: Hssss! I'm a Medusa, beware!<br>Person: You don't look like one.<br>You: I'm not feeling well.<br><br>We-ell you get the picture. Anyway, I'll stop my rambling now <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .<br><br>Kurth

Well, 16 Shifter levels was the minimum for unlimited Medusa form.  19 SD levels give 3 bonus epic feats.  The initial DEX cost for this build made my Wisdom score low if I still wanted tons of Skill points.  I chose to keep Wisdom at 14 because of that.  So lvl 4 Druid spells would be the max.<br><br>It's a tradeoff of what I could self buff with in Druid form with what I could find as buffs from items.  The extra SD levels also make for a stronger Shadow Lord.  A mediocre tank at best, but a meat shield non the less.  I didn't upgrade it to Epic since that form looses the concelment ability.<br><br>This build would not be a very good solo PvP build since Truesight is available to negate the HIPS and the DC on the stone gaze is pathetic.  rolls of 1's are needed hence the need for HIPS.<br><br>HIPS/gaze/hips/gaze/ ... /HIPS/re-shift/gaze...<br><br>a one trick poney is kinda true, but once your ennemy is stone, then you can damage them however you wish.  Wyrmling breath being the best choice I would say.<br><br>Stone gaze is not dependent upon your AB or your ability to penetrate their SR.  It's basically a 1/20 chance of an instant win.  Dev Crit is sometimes removed from servers, but the stone gaze is there most often.<br><br><br>There are some monsters that are immune to gaze attacks (at least there were on the server I played on). so then you would shift to another form for that encounter.  You'd still have your SD levels to benefit from.
