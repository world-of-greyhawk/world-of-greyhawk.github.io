Now since most of my builds tend to be heavily PvP orientated I figured it was time to put up my Sorc, and if you've ever tried a DC sorc in real PvP you should know by now what happens; you get lucky and find someone with no saves or you don't get lucky, and you die.

Dude, you almost make me want to reinstall nwn on my pc!  I at first, thought you did a typo with great constitution (where's the dwarf defender?) but no!  <br><br>I think i am becomin a disciple!  THanks my friend.  You got some crazy, different ideas.  Your builds remind me of Diablo 2 (i dont mean that as a slight at all).  It is taking a class and turning it around to get something unexpected out of it.  We are blessed to have your kind of talent in our guild.  And i am beginning to wish i had met you when i was still playing!

Out of curiousity... Since it's a PvP build and you're not taking rogue at level 1 for skill points, why not take Monk?  Is it just for class spot (because Monks get listen)?<br><br>Because if you went Sorcerer 37/Monk 2/Pally 1, you could take the first Monk pre-epic for a free +2 saves (hey, they never hurt <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   ) and Evasion, then pally somewhere around level 25 (second discipline dump) and finally Monk near 40.  This way you get Evasion early, +2 saves and an extra discipline dump, at the cost of using listen instead of spot and no UMD.<br><br>Listen does kind of suck for a caster though, since you can't target them with spells directly...<br><br>But at any rate, spread around your levels a bit and maybe take an extra rogue level so you can get Evasion early (say, in your 20s instead of near 40).  Awesome feat if IGMS is fixed since most enemy casters will use DC reflex spells on you like DBF and Chain Lightning.<br><br>PS: At the cost of 2 CON I would take ESF: Discipline and ESF: Concentration.  Just to be sure, since Epic Warding doesn't last all day.  Or if you can't get more than +6 CON from items (usually that's the limit for a single item), make it odd so you get +6 item and +5 maxed Endurance.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bertuzzi on 03/02/09 06:27</span></i></p>

UMD is actually very useful if you're on a server with scrolls; Mord followed by a WoF scroll is just plain lethal to anything you'll ever fight.<br><br>And while listen is ok..at best, I didn't want to take the chance of a stealther popping a silence on himself and more or less negating listen.<br><br>And yeah you can spread levels around of course but I was wanting to get epic warding as soon as possible change it to however you want to play it.<br><br>The -2 con for more ESFes is of course completely worth it if you can't fit much +skills into your gear

Popping a silence on yourself = a nice, shiny white aura that's just oh so tempting to chuck an Ice Storm or a half-dozen at.  Just cast a mantle on yourself first.<br><br>By the way, unless you're going for Improved Combat Casting (I gather it you aren't since I don't see it in the leveling guide), there's absolutely no point in getting Combat Casting since it only works in defensive casting mode (which no one ever uses, and even if you do, you don't need the feat because spell DC is fixed so the max concentration check is somewhere around 30 or so).<br><br>But getting ICC is more than worth it.  No AOOs for in combat = you get hit much less by fighters.  And I assumed you were going for it anyway..  IMO take it instead of ESF concentration..<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bertuzzi on 03/02/09 08:46</span></i></p>

Yeah about the white aura it'll disappear if you zone after casting it unless it was finally fixed in .69<br><br>And I finally remember what that feat was supposed to be in place of Combat Casting take Extend use it for extended haste on your familiar or on yourself while using Tensers<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Revenant Mattlov on 03/02/09 11:27</span></i></p>

See, I told you the kid had talent.  I was going to post on it last night but I was...delayed by a series of unfortunate events.  <br><br>While I don't PvP, it's hard not to see how something like this could win.  In fact, I think he would do pretty well in most PvM environments.  Were it me, I would think about dropping the Rogue altogether and add two Fighter levels to grab EDR I and II.  Because really, does a 36th level Sorcerer with a 30 Con really need UMD?  The other skills, perhaps, but we certainly don't need Tumble, which leaves Evasion.  Maybe.  But then, you could just stop Chr at 20 (because we're not really focusing on the DCs, admittedly, with a 24Chr), grab the last EDR Feat, and nail down some more Epic spells to sling around while the enemy bashes on your indestructible frame.  At that point, Paladin isn't entirely critical to the build, and if he really wants evasion he could probably go for Monk1.  But even here, I would be tempted to say "screw Evasion" and take Ranger1 to grab your Spot skill and a Mage-related epic feat.<br><br>In spite of my musings, this guy is fine as is.  What's nice about him, and the same holds true for your previous build, is that it fuels the fires of the player mind, inspires new ideas, concepts, ways of thinking and approaching the game.  Even if it were unintended and seemingly old hat.  It's not the cliche' "Exalted Sorceress" build, but rather, an almost Dwarven-approach to sorcery.

With 24 Charisma and +12 to Charisma from gear I was able to hit 8 spells a day as I had posted with the build so bear that in mind when you lower the charisma, if you're not concerned about 1 extra 9th lvl spell a day Grizzled put up several excellent ideas both feat and class related.<br><br>BTW if you wanted you could always be a Dwarf and still drop 2 Great Charismas, Dwarven Sorcerers for everyone! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Revenant Mattlov on 03/02/09 22:39</span></i></p>

Ah, sorry, I mentioned the Paladin levels pre-epic because technically you lose nothing by doing so, or at least I don't see what you lose, whereas base saves will improve +3 to your fortitude with 2 Paladin levels pre-epic at the loss of mere 1 Will. Epic Fortitude would be only for extremes, because that will make you lose an epic feat, if you can get the gear then forget about Epic Fortitude, no advantage there. The thing is, I'm overly used to low magic settings, so when it comes down to "buff up with gear" my mind blows, I usually forget about it.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
