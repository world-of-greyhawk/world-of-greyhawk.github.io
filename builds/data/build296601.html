He has 3 Spell level 5 slots which I use for maxed Bulls Strength, Cats Grace, and Owls Wisdom. Ultra Vision and Darkness for sneaks. You have some buff spells for the rest of your spell slots or no save combat spells. UMD is high enough to use any scroll, and you can make a few yourself, like Melfs Acid Sheathe.<br> <br>I would like to keep him Unarmed, as I hate kamas as a build and as weapon in general. There is also a lack of lvl 20 Unarmed Monk builds, that arent dragon anyways.<br><br>I used the 'Pretty Good Char Creater" for this guy. He would have killed a Dracolich 3 times over except he kept full healing himself. He can kill everything in the playground, except that Prismatic dragon, which is because I did not have gloves for him to hit him. All my testing, including Dracolich fight and lvl 40 Fighters an such, was done while naked<br><br>Anyways, this is my first build so if I have forgoten anything please let me know <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kyrate on 05/16/08 02:13</span></i></p>

Hmm, you're taking Dodge as if you don't have more melee feats to take, drop it for Improved Critical. Don't worry about anybody "not wanting Epic Dodge" that has never happened.<br><br>I'd drop Maximize Spell, since it requires slots 3 levels higher and you only have 10 Wizard levels, you'll hardly get any spells that can get maximized properly, so it's almost useless, but I'm not sure what would be good instead, at least Empowered should be more useful, it works 2 slots above instead of 3.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Thanks for the reply. I guess im just kinda weird but sometimes I like Crippling Strike more than Epic Dodge lol.<br><br>I like the Maximized Spell feat because, even though I have few slots, I can maximize Bulls Strength, Cats Grace, and Owls Wisdom. I have 3 slots for my lvl 5 spells and those fit right in them. If I want another lvl 5 spell there instead, I will just make a scroll for it.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kyrate on 05/16/08 04:58</span></i></p>

30 of your levels are tumble class, and still you manage to get only 6 AC from tumble? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>Take 4 rogue levels pre-epic so you have 4 monk to skilldump in your epic life. Opens up discipline dumps too, if you like them. Nets you 2 AC, can't really see you lose much. In addition you have better access to stealth skills too.<br><br>That said, did you consider Monk18/Rogue13/Wiz9 for both Epic Dodge and crippling strike? If you also take kama instead of unarmed you can self-buff with flame weapon, keen and GMW too. While I'm at it, you can cast all arcane scrolls without UMD. Your comment seems to indicate otherwise, although you're probably talking about divine ones. <br><br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>*edit* Man, you need Blindfight. Plenty of your pre-epic feats can be switched for it.<br>*ninja-edit* Taking 4 rogue in pre-epics give you much earlier Uncanny Dodge too. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 05/16/08 14:00</span></i></p>

Hmm, the 4 rogue pre epic sounds nice, Ill try it out.<br><br>With the UMD I was under the impression that to cast a scroll you need to beat a DC of 25 + spell level. But what kind of Rogue would not pick up UMD anyways?<br><br>I dont know about switching the levels to <br>Monk 18/Rogue 13/ Wizard 9 as, though crippling strike and epic dodge would be cool to have, I would lose a lvl 5 spell slot, thus losing one of my maximized buff spells. 18 monk, I lose Perfect Self and my Will saves arent great. I also lose cool glowing eyes <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   But I will try it and see what happens.<br>Thanks for the suggestions.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kyrate on 05/16/08 15:42</span></i></p>

You can actually cast for example Cat's Grace over itself, though they don't stack the highest roll is the one that stays on top, so if your first roll was a 3 just cast it again and you'll get a better roll eventually. Works great when you have the extra slots, not really the case though.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Yeah, I would take Empower over Maximized, but only under certain condidtions. If the mod has resting restrictions, then I will take Max, since I cant rest and recast over and over again to get 6 or 7. If there are no resting restrictions, such as OC, I will take Empower.<br><br>Thanks for the replys. I hope I dident do too badly on my first attempt at a build. I love Monks, Rogues, and Bards so hopefully I will post a few more builds <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
