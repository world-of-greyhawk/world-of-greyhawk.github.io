A high AC is always nice, but frankly it doesn't mean anything if you can't hit back, and it means even less if you can't do damage.  As it stands, you have 0 damage output.  Any buff that you hope to propell you through combat will expire after 5 rounds, 5 turns or 5 hours.  Even Flame Weapon will be gimped for you because you only have 5 levels.<br><br> If you are relying on +12 gear, and +12 blades that do +20 Divine damage, then I suppose you're fine, but if I were you, I would drop PM way down to 16, and exchange SD for Rogue, and raise Wizard to 10 and get Extend Spell. Something like Wiz10/PM16/Rogue14.  In this type of set-up, you trade some defense for some offense, but essentially keep your core defense (Crit Immune, solid AC, Epic Dodge, stealth).  This also allow you to take some Rogue up front so you can raise your AB.  You can go Rogue12/Wiz4/PM4 and still get a 13BAB.  Not great, but the best you can hope for.  <br><br>Additionally, drop the combat casting.  And Improved.  I don't expect a build like this to be casting in combat, unless it's Truestrike so he can hit something.  I also wouldn't waste my time with spending General Epic Feats on spells like Hellball, Dragon Knight, or any of those others.  Get Epic Warding and, if you must, Epic Mage Armor.  Save your feats for Great Dexes as you really need to jack this guy's Dex.<br><br>Also, you need to indicate if this is playable from 1-40 and, if not, at what levels would you play it, and also include optimal playing environs (e.g., High Magic, PvP)<br><br>Edit: By taking only 4 levels of Wizard pre-epic, you allow yourself 2 wizard bonus feats that can be used for Great Int. This means you only have to spend 2 more feats to get to 20 (or 19 if you desire).  This allows you to increase Dex from the start, and qualify for ED much earlier than would have been otherwise possible.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 06/28/06 13:42</span></i></p>

Thanks for your feedback grizzled_warlord<br><br>Yes this character is AC focused, and when I play him I often rely on using magic with stealth tactics to damage foes, espesially melee characters.<br><br>Damage is bad but not zero though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>Exaxt damage calculation using a rapier of the high road +1 (that isn't a very strong blade but has keen):<br><br>1-6 basic - average 3.5<br>+1 enchantment      1<br>1d6 acid    average 3.5<br>total 7 avarage base damage multiplied by 1.45 (45%critical) the average damage will be 11.6 per succesful hit<br><br>I will raise wizard to 14 and lover PM to 16 and try it out. That will give him more magig damage output from for example bigbys crushing. I will lose some AC and HP though.<br><br>I play shadowdancer becase I like the Hide in plain sight feat in the stealth tactics I play. But sacrifice that for some sneak damage sounds reasonable <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

You can take palemaster after having only 3 levels of Arcane caster class. It's a scripting error or something. So 3 levels of Bard, Sorcerer or Wizard is all you need.<br>Rock on.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

In the second build drop Dodge for Extend Spell and move Wiz5 to epic and PM4 to pre-epic. One more feat, one more BAB point. Also do not dual wield rapiers, you get a further -2 penalty. I wouldn't dual wield in this build at all because your ab is simply too low.<br>_________________<br>"We keep our Feast of Feasts, sure of our bourne,<br>                 Our aims self-same:<br>The Guest of Guests, friend <i>Zarathustra</i>, came!<br>The world now laughs, the grisly veil was torn,<br>And Light and Dark were one that wedding-morn."<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 06/28/06 18:16</span></i></p>

Honestly, if you press it, you can get ED by Level 24 and there is no reason why you can't.  You're an elf for cryin out loud.  Then take Rogue 14 at Level 37.  You don't need the 11th level of Wizard.  <br><br>Also, adjust your skill points a bit.  You only need a 40 Tumble, which you can get at level 37.  A 42 Tumble means nothing in a naked dex build.
