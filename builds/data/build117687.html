In response to Brian32's post requesting good 25-level builds for the single-player game...<br><br>Out of the characters I've made so far, my personal favorite is my Bard/Red Dragon Disciple/Champion of Torm. Yeah, another one of those. But this one's different. More emphasis on Bard than the other ones.<br>I went with a female halfling for the sheer punk factor. She's so tiny!<br><br>Halfling Bard 11/RDD 10/CoT 4<br>Level 1 stats:<br>S 10 D 16 C 12 I 14 W 10 Ch 15<br>With RDD bonuses:<br>S 18 D 16 C 14 I 16 W 10 Ch 17<br>I haven't included the level-up bonuses here because I wanted to leave your options open on epic feats. I was planning on lots of Charisma, myself, but her other stats certainly open up other options, like Devastating Crit or Improved Whirlwind Attack, if you'd rather go that way.<br><br>Planned level breakdown (to 25):<br>1-5: Bard 1-5 (feats: Artist, Weapon Proficiency Exotic)<br>6-13: RDD 1-8 (feats: Weapon Focus Katana, Dodge, Mobility)<br>14-16: Bard 6-8 (feat: probably Improved Critical)<br>17-20: CoT 1-4 (feats: Expertise, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack)<br>21-22: RDD 9-10 (feat: Epic Skill Focus Perform)<br>23-25: Bard 9-11 (feat: Lasting Inspiration)<br>From there on: Bard to 20, then CoT to 10<br><br>Taking your levels in this order gets you +16 BAB at level 20 for that oft-desired fourth attack per round. You also get outstanding save bonuses.<br>BAB at 25: +19/+14/+9/+4<br>Save Bonuses: Fort +17/Ref +17/Will +18 (including the Champ's special bonus and the halfling race bonus, but not ability score adjustments)<br><br>Weapon of choice: Katana. It lets her dish out halfway respectable damage even in the early, puny stages of her career. Later, wielding it two-handed with a Strength of 18 should be pretty darned spiffy.<br><br>This is really just a fun, goofy build for single player and co-op multiplayer. I don't think much of her chances in PvP, although she will have pretty impressive saves and just might survive a Devastating Crit or two. She can hold her own in a fight, but her real forte is general party support.<br>_________________<br>"The problem with playing by the rules is, you end up playing with yourself."<br>-Alex Desert, Becker<br><br>Edited By Tluhdatsi on 03/01/04 20:00:12<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 16:59</span></i></p>
