Learning by trying. Make up a build, give it a shot yourself and let us adjust from there.<br><br>By one of us putting up a complete build without anything to go by, you won't exactly learn much. My advice is to put up a build in this thread and let's how far you've gotten. I've no doubt that the build will turn out better thatn you believe up front. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Huh? No offense but you can't ask someone else to make you a build giving them the class spread, if you have the class spread set then you already have the biggest part of it ready IMO, build it yourself.<br><br>You'd need only stats, skills and feats. DEX based or STR based, what kind of weapon and that's it, show us your build and we'll give advice to improve it.<br><br>Since the spread is so crucial obviously part of the advice could be regarding changing the spread, for example, I wouldn't take 9 Monk levels for a Monk/Rogue/Cleric, I'd probably just take 1.<br><br>Monk/Rogue/Cleric is quite a strong build, you'll get a powerful character even without an expert build.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.
