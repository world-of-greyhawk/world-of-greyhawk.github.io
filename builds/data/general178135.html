First of all, you realize that you can't Finesse scimitars, which means that this will have to be a Str-based build.  Generally speaking, one of the best ways to add AC to a Str-based build is to wear a shield, but since you're dual-wielding, no shield for you.  Also realize that you will suffer a -4 penalty to hit even with all the dual-wield feats because scimitars are not considered light weapons.  <br><br>If you don't mind being cheesy, I'd suggest something like a Bard 14/RDD 10/PM 16, because he can get a high AC and still manage to do decent damage.  You'll get +8 AC from Tumble, +4 from RDD, and another +6 from PM. You will also get +3 Dodge AC from Bard Song, which stacks with Dodge AC from items.  <br><br>In addition, you can cast Haste on yourself for +4 AC,  Epic Mage Armor should boost your AC by another 20 points, Cat's Grace will boost it by another 1-2 points (1-4 if it's empowered), and then you have Improved Invis., which doesn't improve your AC, but which WILL give your opponents a %50 chance to miss every time they attack you (25% miss chance with Blind-Fight).<br><br>So, assuming you're wearing mundane medium armor, your AC should look something like this:<br><br>10 base<br>+4 Dex<br>+8 Tumble<br>+4 RDD<br>+10 PM<br>+3 Dodge (Bard Song)<br>+4 Haste<br>+20 Epic Mage Armor<br>+4 Medium Armor<br>+2 Armor Skin<br>________________<br>69 AC<br><br>Note that this is your AC without items of any kind.  <br><br><br>Your AB should look like this:<br><br>25    base<br>+11   Str<br>+1-2  Bull's Str<br>+1    Epic Prowess<br>+1    WF <br>+2    EWF<br>+4    Greater Magic Weapon<br>+2    Bard Song<br>-4    Dual-wield<br>_____________<br>~43-44 AB<br>    <br><br>Bard 14/RDD 10/PM 16<br>(Pre-epic Bard 12/RDD <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif">  <br><br>Note: You dilute your AB if you take PM levels pre-epic<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 14<br>Dex 14<br>Con 14<br>Int 14<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 14<br><br>+1 Dex, +9 Str<br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 32<br>Dex 15<br>Con 16<br>Int 16<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 16<br><br>Feats <br><br>1  Power Attack, Cleave<br>3  TWF<br>6  Ambidexterity<br>9  Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>12 Great Cleave<br>15 Improved Critical<br>18 ITWF<br>21 Epic Weapon Focus<br>24 Great Str I<br>27 Armor Skin<br>30 Epic Prowess<br>33 Overwhelming Critical<br>36 Devastating Critical, PM: Energy Resistance<br>39 Epic Mage Armor, PM: Epic Warding<br><br>Note:  You might want Toughness or Blind-Fight as well, and if that's the case then the only feats you can really afford to sacrifice would be Epic Prowess or Armor Skin.

Minor mistake: I forgot that Scimitar is considered a Martial weapon.  Meaning that if you go this route, you will need to take the Martial Weapon proficiency, which will probably put Improved TWF back into Epic levels.<br><br>Of course, you could go with Shortswords instead and reduce your penalty to AB for dual-wielding, but then your critical threat range wouldn't be quite as good.
