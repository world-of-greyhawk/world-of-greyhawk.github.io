Why not take two Monk levels in exchange for Wizard, and use UMD to get True Strike?<br><br>Seems like it would certainly better, though if you are going for originality you have it down..

And uncanny dodge, which is helpful for not getting hit.  DC on the stunning fist goes down as you have to use feats to make up the AB bump from the bard song.  The bard can effectively add +5 to his AB, however, for the curse effect on his opponent's AC.  And his AC is effectively +2 for the curse impact on his opponent's AB.  And the DC of the stunning fist is also impacted by another +2 for the curse effect on that save.<br><br>And the monk has no ability to self-buff (although empty body and SR and improved evasion will all help).  Divine Wrath goes way down in duration, too, which is not insignificant with 18 CoT levels...  <br><br>So it's odd but not indefensible.<br><br>Besides, I like the gaffer's home brew *burp*<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Ithacan

I think the concern, Ithacan, was that poor AB, coupled with no damage output and poor hitpoints, and an XP penalty and no Uncanny Dodge, kind of spells disaster.  Simply stunning an opponent itself is not enough.  There has to be something to follow through with such a maneuver.  One can't survive a prolonged dungeon crawl or epic quest with a handful of stunning fists and some true strikes.  Especially when you start encountering DR and Stun/Paralysis Immunities.  Bard20 helps, but in this case I don't think it's enough.  Scrolls and buffs only go so far, as most of these can be dispelled and leave you pretty much a punching bag, and Divine Wrath is of limited use here.  Once a day may help you get a Dragon down to Barely Injured.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Oh, well, yes, that, of course. He's designed to sit in middle of a field, once per day, invisible.  Wait for the right moment, true strike, stunning fist, disarm them, pp them, and then get on with his day.  He's a one-trick pony with little else to offer, except that he can BS his friends before they go off to do something useful.  <br><br>It does say 'PvP 40'

Damage output is offensive, notice that an Epic Barbarian gets about enough DR to resist through your stunning fists, not to say Dwarven Defender...<br><br>I do like the DC though, it's just as good as my Stunning Claw, this guy will make a good party guy, but don't try PvP alone.
