As you mention a dex based TWF fighting version would be superior to this build - much higher AC and 2 more attacks per round, since you rely on sneaks a lot I don't think the lower damage would be too much of a problem.<br><br>Still a Good build though.

Cheers....<br><br>I think i'll make a dex variant.  Only problem with that is that id be very sorley tempted to swap the Assassin level for 1 SD level just because HiPS is always nice to have.  Still 29D6 sneak would be quite cute with dual wielded daggers.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

Yeah but I think your original concept was: "max sneak at 4 attacks per round"<br><br>Otherwise I would suggest a Rogue 35/Fighter 4/assassin 1, you get one less sneak but basically all the TWF-feats for free.<br><br>Btw. this char NEEDS a "cowl of warding" or something because the will save is horrible.

Aye I know...you are right on both points.  The will save fully sucks, luckily Golden Circlets are availiable on the server which I play so its only going to be failed saves versus sanctuary etc that would be a problem.

Have you considered swapping some rogue levels for more assassin levels to gain some spell access like improved invisibility? I'm not certain how that would affect your feat count, but just tossing the idea out there.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

I think it 1s possible with mixing in some more assassin. Possibly easier in a way...I'll do a quick test going epic assassin rather than epic rogue and report back with the results.

Well...i just tried a version with rogue 9 BG 4 assassin 27 and it dosent get the full 30d6 or the rogue bonus feats....although it still gets 28d6 sneak and because of the later qualification for ISA i was able to add 6 to the will save with feats.

I'd say Rogue 27/BG 4/Assassin 9 - you will get 29d6 sneak that way (14 rg + 1 BG + 5 *** + 9 improved) and still have all the Assassins spell-like abilities.<br><br>If you want to stick with your original concept your first build was the best, otherwise I would suggest:<br><br>Go the dex route.<br>Go for epic dodge.<br>Don't take BG, take fighter instead - 3 extra feats plus it removes the need for 2 feats (power att, cleave) and 13 in STR.

Aye..the assassin 9 seems good...although the improved will save from the epic assassin build levels it out a bit.

Not going the BG route might be good, but if you have access to cha boosting items it can improve the saving throws by up to 5 points (assuming that you can get the full +12 to cha), which would be very useful considering the awful saving throws on this build.

One other suggestion: since you have so many skill points, why not take a late level of Blackguard (say level 40) and max Taunt?  A higher Taunt score would mean that you would not only be more likely to be successful, but would also lower your opponent's AC by more if you are.

Well, i eventually made a dex variant, with more or less the same level progression, just some feats changed in pre epic (wpn finesse, ambidex, 2 wpn fighting and imp 2 wpn fighting replaced the kd feats, wpn focus and improved critical feats).<br><br>Starting stats were as follows :<br><br>Str 13, Dex 16, Con 12, Wis 10, Int 14 Cha 11  (If i remember correctly)<br><br>I took the assassin level at 24, in order to get the feat (imp sneak attack) and based the char on fighting with 2 daggers, which gave a nice 6/round.<br><br>All ability increases went into dex, eventually raising it to 26.  The really nice bit was that at lv 39 by which time I already had the Improved sneak attack 10 feat, I could take epic dodge.<br><br>So for a very rough calculation of the potential damage per round, assuming that all attacks made in the combat round and do full sneak damage (which is extremly unlikely to happen due probability) you would be able to do 6 x 30D6 sneak damage = 180 D6 sneak damage/round = 1080 additional sneak damage each round (again I stress the word potentially).
