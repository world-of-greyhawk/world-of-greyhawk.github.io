IKD is handy for your Sneak Attacks. Of course EWS is great for Fighters as well. Is there a reason you only want two classes?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By whirlin_merlin on 10/08/07 22:59</span></i></p>

Well, that's too much Fighter IMO, you'll have too many feats and nothing good to place them on, I'd suggest something like a Fighter 18 / Blackguard 22, to increase your Sneak Attack at least.<br><br>You know, the basics...<br><br>Blind-Fight, Power Attack, Knockdown, Improved Critical, Weapon Focus, Epic Weapon Focus, Epic Prowess, Armor Skin, Weapon Spcialization, Epic Weapon Specialization, if you want dev crits then take Cleave, Great Cleave, Overwhelming Critical, Devastating Critical (if not then more feats to play with), Great Strength VI, whatever else you can, I'm not really counting how many I wrote, but it's 7 pre-epic and 7 epic if I remember correctly, plus 10 bonus feats from Fighter and 4 bonus feats from Blackguard.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

I agree with Thax. That is too much Fighter. I dont think 10 BG levels would be worth much. I like to throw in some Rogue levels with that combo, but if you only want the two classes then I would go as heavy BG as possible. 12 Fighter/28 Blackguard.

Another option is to use Blackguard for Dark Blessing. That works best in a build that already has invested in Charisma for some reason; eg Sorcerer, smiter Paladin, Bard, and some builds with Cleric or CoT.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...
