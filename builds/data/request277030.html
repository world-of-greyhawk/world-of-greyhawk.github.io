Hey guys! I'm looking for a nice spell sword build, with a good healthy balance between melee and caster. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Rules of the server are...<br>+5 Items mostly<br>No RDD, No PM<br>Lots of Dev critters.<br><br>For the build, I would like mostly caster levels, but preferabley no cleric. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Yeah, no cleric! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br>But able to do decently in melee combat. I assume some sort of Paladin/Sorc would be good for this?<br>Don't want shifter, thanks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>Preferabley sword and shield. Or..Just sword..Or...Sword Shield and Fullplate...Surprise me! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br>And if you can make it good in PvP, bonus points! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

On your server, I had (before they wiped the vault <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  ) a 23 Sorcerer, 16 Paladin, 1 Monk made.  It used shield and rapier, had nice AB, and very high AC with Divine Shield.<br><br>So let's see, 28 BAB + 7 STR + 3 Weapon Focus (epic/pre-epic) + 1 Epic Prowess + 5 GMW = 44.  When buffed with Bless, Aid, Divine Favor, and Prayer, it hit 52 AB.  With maxed STR, it becomes 58 of course.<br><br>I had Epic Mage Armor or Epic Warding ( I only hit 36 before the wipe, and hadn't chosen yet), but you could choose both if you dropped a Great CHA feat.  That would put CHA at 19 instead of 20.  Alternatively, you could end with 22 STR, 19 CHA, and grab Auto-Still 1/2, and Epic Warding.  That's probably what I would of done - the important 9th level spell, Mordenkanien's Disjunction, didn't figure in spell failure, and 7th/8th level spells could be casted stilled as one slot higher. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br><br>I could lay it out for you if you'd like.

Here's my spellsword, which is special in that it's focused on the spell - namely, I built it with Finger of Death in mind. DC of 40 with +12 INT on. It still has decent melee presence vs. "mobs" due to Ftr and CoT levels <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "247654", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> (personally I think Wiz/Ftr/CoT is one of the best multiclasses for spellswords in NWN1)<br>_________________<br>" -- They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then it's night once more."<br><br> - Pozzo in Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett

16 monk/3 rogue/21 wiz with dual kamas has speed, ac, damage uncanny dodge for flat foot ac and gets some decent ab with ts which you can get quite a few of, and gets ac from epic mage armor (5 ac of everything = 20). I generally prefer wiz over sorc for hybrids since it allows for better melee and defense due to the bonus feats at 5,10,15 and 20, and can afford more skill points.

There are many good bard-heavy builds that qualify as "spellswords".<br><br>Other than that, cleric has got what you're looking for, but if you don't want that...<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan
