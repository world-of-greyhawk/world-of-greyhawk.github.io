Yeah, I know.  You all haven't seen enough of those yet.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Basically what me be doing is this.

This will also get me AB, more feats, and at 5th level, adding CHA bonus to damage.  Though I think it's only once per day.

It depends on when you plan to take the lvls.  See, you will need about 10 "fighter" lvls pre-epic to have a bab of 16, iirc.  Sorry my math is rusty, you may need 12! (sorc is 1/2 bab, so 8 lvls is 4, so you would need 12!)  Regardless, you don't have enough lvls planned for this.   So, you're sorc/pal will be melee gimped.  The ONLY other way to increase bab from this point is to increase strength/dex (whichever you use).  RDD gives 8 str or +4 ab.  Fighter OR cot taken in epic gives no increase to bab (wm would though!! 10+ lvl though).   <br><br>So, from what you have said, you want a sorc31/pal4/??5.  It could make more sense to go sorc26/pal4/??10.   If your goal is to get to 16bab (4 ats/rd) then I would take 10 pal/4ftr lvls, taking lv4 ftr in epic to get ews.   This would get you most of what you askd for (decent bab, mostly sorc).  Hope that helps.<br><br>If you get stuck, there are PLENTY of builds to look at.

Yes, there are plenty of builds to look at, but most (and I mean most EVERY one I saw) either had the Sorc teaming with RDD or COT for their sword in the "spellsword" build.<br><br>Just thought that a few levels of Fighter levels might make the build useful too.  <br><br>Admittedly RDD does give one a lot of benefits.  Though with Fighter and EWS, that's +6 to damage.  It's like adding 12 STR (well, almost).<br><br>And Fighters (or COT's) get bonus feats too, which could come in handy.  <br><br>Just wondered what most of the experts opinion is on a Sorc/Pally/Fighter sort of build.  Since especially RDD combos and to a certain extent, COT builds, have been done almost to death with this sort of spellsword buld.<br><br>Joe

Especially when RDDs get +8 STR which effectively adds +4 damage (or +6 with a two-handed weapon <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <b></b>). The STR bonus also adds to AB, which EWS does not; Fighter has 4/4 AB progression, though, so if taken pre-epic, it can increase your AB. Most likely it won't increase it by 4, unless of course you take a LOT of Fighter levels. If you want my opinion, RDD *is* the better choice for a Sorcerer/Paladin.<br><br>Another thing to consider is a Sorcerer/Paladin/Harper Scout; Harper Scout gives two extra epic feats at the cost of two pre-epic ones (of which Iron Will is quite nice, but Alertness hardly useful). It also gives a Tumble dump for +4 AC compared to a build without a "Tumble class".<br><br>Just came from school so I might be bit confused, sorry if I'm not making any sense <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"><br>_________________<br>"And one calculates <i>time</i> from the <i>dies nefastus</i> on which this fatality arose – from the <i>first</i> day of Christianity! – <i>Why not rather from its last?</i> – <i>From today?</i> – Revaluation of all values!"

Don't worry, you make perfect sense FinneousPJ.<br><br>I think I'll give up on the Fighter part of the build.<br><br>Will either go with your suggestions of RDD or HS.  Am experimenting with some COT too, since it can create synergy with Paladink levels.<br><br>Thanks again for the input!<br><br>Joe

Keep in mind that you need quite a few Paladin levels to get 16 BAB. Either Paladin 12/Sorcerer 8 or Paladin 8/Sorcerer 4/RDD 8, basically (if you go with HS, you'll want to take all HS levels in epic).<br>_________________<br>"And one calculates <i>time</i> from the <i>dies nefastus</i> on which this fatality arose – from the <i>first</i> day of Christianity! – <i>Why not rather from its last?</i> – <i>From today?</i> – Revaluation of all values!"
