There's no reason to take Martial Proficiency when you take 4 levels of Ftr pre-epic anyway.  So it throws off your spell progression by one level, but it evens out by Level 14 anyway.

Oh, the build is nice.

However you lose 5 AB and damage - and your maximum AB ever at the moment is 56. It's not that high against epic bosses, not to mention Dexterity based AC tanks. And the real point behind this is the unbuffed AB of 30.

I agree with the dwarflord, there's little logic in wasting a feat on WP: martial when you can have it for free. Start off as a FTR, so you don't waste that feat sloton WP: martial. You'll have access to most of the weapons you might find right from the start and you have an easier 1st lvl also. <br>I would start with CHA 8 and DEX 10, but I guess it's a matter of taste.<br>I believe you don't plan to go against anyone able to use dispel, cause in that case you are in a lot of trouble. You are easily dispellable and when you get dispelled you have just your HP to rely on. The way your build is now, once debuffed you are just a big bag of meat.<br><br>I would pump up STR instead of CON. Actually I would start with STR 14, CON 14 or better yet, start with dwarf STR 14, CON 16 and leave CHA 6, forgetting about turning the dead. Probably I'd get more FTR lvls preepic to improve AB also and I'd try to get expertise/impr.exp. to pump up AC when needed (f.e. if I get debuffed and I need to rebuff while in combat or to cast II or GS to get out of trouble).<br>Empower spell maybe instead of maximise but again, that's just matter of taste, I'd say.<br>Finally I'd take the last cleric lvl at 40th lvl to max out spellcraft (43+2=45 for +9 ST vs spells).<br>I guess this is all I had to say <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Ok, before this gets bloody: my opinion is that you're sacrificing too much offensive capability with that Constitution of 32. By rearranging your attributes, you could effectively gain +6 AB and damage with the loss of 400 HP and 5 Fortitude.<br><br>If you prefer the defense and it does good where you play, then go for it.

I don't think there's many issues with this build other than the low AB and the Martial Weapons feat. I'd take the Dwarflord's advice and pick up FTR at level 1 for the free proficiency, then go CLC from there. I'd also do as others suggest and lower the CON a bit and raise STR. My preference would be an unbuffed AB of +38 or so (This is what I did with my <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "222147", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Clangeddin's Wrath</a> build: FTR 12/CLC 18/CoT 10). This way, when you're dispelled, you can just recast a single spell to get it up to a respectable value (Divine Power, Divine Favor, or whatever). I'd assume you'd have a STR-boosting item or two to help out anyway though (unless you're playing a completely no-magic environment).<br><br>I'd also get those epic CoT levels in ASAP to get the GRT WIS feats. As the Dwarflord mentioned, you're going a long time without access to your higher level spell slots.<br><br>As for being dispelled, I wouldn't worry about that. Sure, it can happen, but I've seen (and played) plenty of buffing builds with low caster levels that can be dispelled. It's a chance you take and you need some kind of backup plan. I go for the higher STR and moderate CON fall-back position. You've chosen the high CON route. Meh, I think either way can work.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 12/26/05 20:31</span></i></p>

I mostly agree with what the Dwarflord said - get fighter earlier for free martial proficiency, and take more warrior AB levels pre-epic, and you'll be better off.<br><br>Buffing up to your AB limit using a low-AB character is nice in theory - I mean, you get an AB of +50 with a mundane weapon after you buff!  Huzzah!  But... it's safe to assume everyone in epic levels will have +5 weapons, so GMW kind of gives you a false increase, except in critically low-magic environments.  Many of the direct AB-boosting buffs are round/level duration, so you won't be using them in every fight lest you run out of spells too quickly.<br><br>Against cannon fodder, then, you'll probably have a buffed AB in the lower to middle 40s.  Which is the same as the unbuffed/mundane equipment AB of most melee builds.  Then you'd go up to your full buff against bosses... except for the problem that even at full buff you'd probably only hit bosses on a 20 with a max AB of +56 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br>For a battle cleric I would aim for an unbuffed AB of +35 at a bare minimum, if not +38 or higher.  The better you can get the unbuffed AB the more your buffs put you ahead of the game instead of merely drawing you up equal with unbuffed fighters.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Sure you can rebuff yourself, but you have to be able to do it. IE can be made to work even where "switched off" during casting, since it switches off only after you cast. Activate it immediately after you cast the spell and you'll always have +10 AC. It's a feat worth considering, even if just to GS yourself out of trouble.<br>The point is that usually builds with fewer caster lvls tend to be more selfreliant when not buffed than yours, that's all; after all yours is supposed to be a battle cleric. If you were to take more lvls and focus on casting it would be different.

Considering the lack of use of CHA from both domains and Divine Wrath, have you considered going Dwarf instead? This would tie in with your CON fetish that appears to be going on here, giving you 18 at start up. <br><br>Another in agreement with Martial Proficiency as has been mentioned previously.<br><br>Epic Toughness at 38th... I'd lose that for something, anything more useful than another 20 HP.

pretty nifty.  i might recommend dropping martial proficiency, and replacing it with exotic.  then focus in the kukri.  you have the same crit range as the rapier, and instead of piercing you do slashing damage (i find piercing damage too easily absorbed).  i recommend using scimitar also, instead of rapier, for that reason, since you don't seem to be finessing.  but if you want a martial weapon really badly, take fighter a bit earlier.  just seems easier.<br><br>nifty numbers.  i first gagged on the CON, but it seems pretty nice.  I think if you lost a little CON, though, you would still survive well enough.  you can always take magic domain for stoneskin to help boost combat survivability.<br><br>interesting concept.  a high CON cleric.  i like it, but the AB has me worried.  you need almost all spells to reach a nice AB, if even two or three get dispelled, you need to recast all of three to hit anything.  also, if you run out of spells during a series of long battles, you might be in some trouble.  i dunno about kobolds, but anyone else might prove to have an AC too high to pierce without the spells.<br><br>dwarf would be a good idea, to take advantage of the CON theme even more so.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Many that live deserve death.

I want to add a few comments. It's an okay build, but as stated about 200 times or so, AB is a no no. As for being unbeatable in PvP???? No way. Quite beatable PvP is more correct. A ton of hp's won't help when someone hits and crits all the time while you have trouble hitting back. Even my Dwarven Warpriest build, which is somewhat similar in concept, would give this guy the rough and tumble.<br><br>To give you a pointer on your AB. Pure fighter, STR 32, with focus in a weapon= AB 45. Add +12 STR as that is possible in many settings, then add a +5 weapon. Total AB 56. Your max no matter the circumstances =56. You need to be fully buffed to get a pure fighters AB.<br><br>And another thing, no build is truly unbeatable in PvP. This build has potential. At least go the Dwarf and fighter at lvl 1 route.
