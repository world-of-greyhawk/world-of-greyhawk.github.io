Your problem is that you are going for both Dev Crit and Epic Dodge. That's very tough - at best you will just barely qualify for both. If you get it, you will of course have a DC of at least 37 (1/2 Char level +10 + Str is 37 for a 25 str, the minimum required), but you are unlikely to get it above 38 (you can push either Dex or Str to 26, but not both, and that requires either RDD or Elf).<br><br>My recommendation would be to drop the Dev Crit altogether - if you are an Assassin, you will do sneak damage and Death Attack is effectively a 1-shot kill anyway. Most of the things that are immune to sneaks are also immune to crits, so you don't gain a whole lot by having both. Pump your Dex into the mid-high 30's (improving your AB and AC considerably), pick up Epic Prowess and Armor skin, and don't worry about crits.<br><br>TM

Make it elf and take the XP penalty. STR will be 2 points higher wich should let you qualify for Dev Crit if you really want it. You might have to drop a couple of Assassin lvls for Fighter though in that case.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

I agree with Xylo, Dev Crit is kind of unnecesary (that also frees a pre-epic feat changing Great Cleave)... but if you want it do what Kail said, go Elf with more Fighter epics, Death Attack DC and damage would drop considerably, since you'd need enough Fighter bonus feats to counter the loss of Assassin bonus feats... I'm not very sure if it's possible. BTW, you have 24 STR and 25 DEX so Weapon Finesse gets useless at the end.<br><br>So, I'd think in dropping STR, a lot, also some Great DEX feats, to get ESF Hide and Move Silently, Epic Prowess and Armor Skin...<br><br>But well, attaining, or at least trying to get Dev Crit has one thing that could be good, which is that your base damage is high even though you've got Epic Dodge.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 05/30/06 21:12</span></i></p>
