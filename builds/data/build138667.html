Why not drop the epic toughness feats and work in devastating critical. Scimitar is a high threat range weapon, and would do well with that feat. Otherwise a cool concept.

I love this concept. It's a great idea for a build. The only suggestion I have is to loose the Assassin levels and take Rogue levels instead. Here's why:<br><br>Assassin Gets:<br>1) Some nice spells 1x day. The most notable is the Improved Invis, which you get by taking the Trickery Domain anyway. Ghost Visage is also nice, but not necessary and not that useful at high levels when you finally take assassin.<br>2) Death Attack - great ability, but only when maxed out and with a very high INT score to help make the DC higher. Assassin class is much better off mixed with a Wizard because the INT score compliments both classes. Anyway, your DC for Death attack will not be any good with your setup.<br>3) Sneak attack - great stuff. More sneak attacks is always the way to go.<br>4) Poison Save bonus - very handy. But probably not necessary thanks to the Blackguard's Charisma save bonus.<br>5) Decent skill points. Most Rogue skills are available to the Assassin, but with less skill points.<br>6) Uncanny Dodge - a must have for any class that relies on Dodge AC bonuses or Dex AC bonuses.<br><br>Now reasons for Rogue over Assassin.<br><br>1) More Skill Points.<br>2) Also gets Uncanny Dodge<br>3) Save vs. Traps instead of poison<br>4) EVASION!!! <br>5) 1 bonus feat at 10th level Rogue which could be Improved Evasion or Crippling Strike (+2 STR damage added to Sneak Attacks)<br>6) Already has Invisibility spells from the Trickery Realm.<br>7) Same Sneak Attack benefits.<br><br>The choice is yours of course, but I would definitely recommed that Rogue replaces the Assassin. Take 15 Blackguard instead of 16 and go to Rogue level 10 for the bonus feat. Also, you should be able to take the Epic Fiend at level 15 BlackGuard for a really nasty pet...<br><br>Finally, race. I like Human as the main race. I think that's a great idea. But it seems to me that you should use a 2handed weapon for maximum damage against your foes. If you like the idea of super criticals, I would recommed trying a Cleric/Rogue/BlackGuard as a Halfling. You can then use the Scimitar or Rapier as a 2Handed weapon and get 1.5x your STR bonus to damage. That combined with your frequent criticals will make a huge difference. Additionally, the Halfling gets a ton of benefits to AC, and Saves that make up for the loss of 1 human feat and 1 skill per level.

thx for the input. main reasons i went assassin is i get sick of seeing everyone with rogue lvls and i wanted death attack. i wanted something different. yes rogue might get an extra feat etc but i liked the idea of a truely vile evil villan. Not to mention its hillarious when i paralyse an enemy. the save vs traps wasnt a big issue were i designed this build. it certianly is an interesting concept tho aint it. might try a monk/bg/assassin next. Hehe adapt it anyway you like an post the changes i welcome any additions ppl can make to the build. cheers for the reply mate.<br>_________________<br>'Deekin?'<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kevan_Best on 08/06/04 19:12</span></i></p>
