Master Spellsword:  Wizard 31/Fighter 6/Rogue 3<br><br>Here’s my take on the spellsword. <br>I tried blending various different spellsword builds, most notably The War Wizard (Wizard 35/Rogue 3/Fighter 2 by grizzled_dwarflord, Weave Warrior (Bard 1/Fighter 13/Wizard 26) by Mithdradates, &amp; Boccob's Magic Blade (Wizard 26/Fighter 8/Rogue 6) by Kail Pendragon. <br>First &amp; foremost the master spellsword is a caster. <br>The AB is low &amp; the spell DC is high, but if you get some strength gear early, you can melee away. <br>You can drop epic prowess &amp; 1 strength point to boost Intelligence to 30 if you like. <br>Basically, a lot of fun if you like playing mages but hate wearing robes &amp; carrying a staff, IMO.<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: CG (Any)<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 15 (16)<br>Dex 10	<br>Con 16<br>Wis 8<br>Int 16 (28)<br>Cha 8<br><br><br>Leveling<br><br>1 Wizard – Combat Casting, Toughness<br>2 Wizard<br>3 Fighter – Still Spell, Weapon Focus: Longsword<br>4 Fighter - Expertise<br>5 Wizard<br>6 Wizard – Extend Spell<br>7 Wizard – Spell Focus: Necromancy<br>8 Wizard - <br>9 Fighter – Greater Spell Focus: Necromancy<br>10 Fighter – Improved Expertise<br>11 Wizard <br>12 Wizard – Spell Focus: Evocation<br>13 Wizard<br>14 Wizard – Maximize Spell<br>15 Wizard - Greater Spell Focus: Evocation<br>16 Wizard<br>17 Wizard<br>18 Wizard – Spell Penetration<br>19 Wizard – Greater Spell Penetration<br>20 Wizard - <br>21 Fighter – Armor Skin<br>22 Wizard<br>23 Wizard<br>24 Wizard – Great Intelligence I<br>25 Wizard – Auto Still Spell I<br>26 Wizard<br>27 Wizard – Auto Still Spell II<br>28 Wizard – Auto Still Spell III<br>29 Wizard<br>30 Wizard – Epic Spell: Mage Armor<br>31 Wizard - Epic Spell: Warding<br>32 Wizard <br>33 Wizard - Great Intelligence II<br>34 Wizard - Great Intelligence III<br>35 Rogue <br>36 Rogue – Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy<br>37 Fighter – Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword<br>38 Rogue <br>39 Wizard – Epic Prowess<br>40 Wizard<br> <br><br>Skills<br><br>Appraise 29<br>Concentration 46<br>Discipline 40<br>Heal 43<br>Lore 25<br>Open Lock 20<br>Disable trap 11<br>Search 11<br>Spot 42<br>Spellcraft 43<br>Tumble 40<br>UMD 40<br><br><br>HP<br>362<br><br>AC<br>31 (basic full plate &amp; tower shield)<br>66+ Buffed<br><br>AB<br>+29/+24/+19 (basic longsword)<br>BAB - 22<br><br><br>Saves<br>Fort 22 (+9)<br>Reflex 16 (+9)<br>Will 20 (+9)<br><br>PS - I'm not a well versed with pre-epic AB, so is it possible to switch some rogue levels to pre-epic &amp; raise the AB, possibly going Wizard 30/Rogue 4/Fighter 6 (with a nice xp penalty of coarse). <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">  <br><br>Thanks,<br>Angelfire1<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Angelfire1 on 05/27/08 03:28</span></i></p>

Wow, no feedback at all?<br>Is the build so good that it leaves everybody speechless?  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>C'mon, I was hoping for some constructive critisism here.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Angelfire

A dwarf will have higher con, more hitpoints and better saves. Fighter as favored class avoids xp penalty most of the lvls.<br>You will lose one feat. I don't thing combat casting brings much to the build, so I would have dropped that.<br>You will also lose one skill, eg. heal, but I still think it is worth it to take dwarf.<br><br>Maybe a dwarf should focus in an axe or hammer, just for the style bonus. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>EWF (and epic prowess) comes late in a build with low AB. If you want armor skin early, you could always delay great int I.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

I know spellswords need spellpower but +29 AB is just way too low, and with 16 strength your damage isn't surprising either. In my opinion you're a good full time caster, but spellsword you aint.

By the way, you take Fighter but you don't take Epic Weapon Specialization, why? It is the big melee boost you get from being a Fighter, so not taking it gives me more reason to say this is no spellsword.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;First &amp; foremost the master spellsword is a caster. </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>The build is good, but your melee strength is crap, I'd drop the melee stuff completely at that rate.

Thanks for the feedback.<br><br>OK, I reworked the build to go Wizard 29/ Fighter 8/ Rogue 3.<br>I dropped Combat Casting &amp; picked up Weapon specialization, Epic weapon specialization and + 1 BAB to bring it to +30/+25/+20 (which still is weak) &amp; the damage bonus.<br>My dilemna is that even if one sacrifices casting &amp; boosts the AB to say +37/... you still won't be able to hit the high end AC builds consistently. <br>That being said, I think that ANY spellsword build needs to lean heavy to either caster or melee, hence my level distribution.<br>Anyway, I realize it has some flaws, but it's still a fun build to play, IMO.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Angelfire

You won't hit the high-end AC builds unless you're playing Arcane Archer or Weapon Master, that's a given so don't worry. Besides, that's what spells are for.<br><br>Specializing in one fighting style makes your build so much stronger, having a bit of everything leaves you strong in nothing, that's why the spellsword is a strong build idea: a caster with good melee presence. In my opinion, the best spellsword you can get is with Cleric instead of Wizard or Sorcerer... and the best Wizard route is attained by taking caster only at epic levels, in order to keep BAB; granted, it sucks at spell penetration, but spellpower is still neat.<br><br>The good thing is everyone likes to make builds different, if you listen too much to me you'll end with a very limited class spread.<br>_________________<br>Those who say money does not give happiness are just jealous of those who have money.
