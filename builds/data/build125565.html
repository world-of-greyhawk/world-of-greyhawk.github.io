Do anyone have any idea of how I can improve this character, making it best as it can be keeping all classes that was taken in this level. I am refering to such as feats, skill points, etc etc.<br><br>Anuis

I experimented around with my Mysterious One build little bit more, I managed to boost AC, AB, and HP even farther, it is pretty much at the max at the moment. It comes from the equipments that does work in dragon shape and all buffs that I used.<br><br>I got this...<br><br>AC: 96 (97 once one of the spell wears off)<br>HP: 1141/1140(with temporary hitpoints and virtue(extended))<br><br>AB: +52/+49/+46/+43/+40<br><br>Attack 1: 2-12 +25(Critical: 19-20/x2)<br>Attack 2: 2-12 +25(Critical: 19-20/x2)<br>Attack 1: 2-16 +25(Critical: 19-20/x2)<br><br>+1 Magical Damage<br>+1 Bludgeoning Damage<br><br>As for the equipment(helmet), I was pushing it to its limit, I kept it under legal limit, level 40. I put in STR +12, CON +12, DEX +12 and WIS +12 plus two other stuff just for fun all of that added up to level 40.<br><br>You probably can push it even farther if you used shield.<br><br>Anuis<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Anuis on 04/29/04 00:43</span></i></p>

This build has probably been edited already, and revamped, but I thought I might share my idea.<br><br>Well, I thought to myself, how does 1 cleric level benefit this build? It doesn't, so then I got to thinking, hmmm, what class would be great with this. Since you already have level 8 druid spells, why not maximize this by making it hardcore PVP. <br><br>Instead of getting the small bonus that the 1 cleric level would give +5 ab at the max. I picked the Shadow Dancer class. I decided to go against the usual human race, so I picked Elf. This has helped A LOT. Once you hit a PVP area, and your fully buffed, if you come across a fighter, you can nuke him with spells, OR immediatly shift into Dragon Form, use HIPS, go for a KD, then Stunning Fist (DC should be around 40+), if that hits, shift back to human, cast a HARM, then either smack him with another spell or shift back to dragon and devour him.<br><br>To me, instead of trying to muscle it out, i'd rather catch the guy flat footed, making him even more defenseless. Even vs a mage, if you catch him off guard, you will win. If he sees you, dispel isn't gonna help unless he's a lower level caster than you so good luck, not even the cleric level would help there.<br><br>So with all that said, I think adding SD would maximize this build.<br><br>~Ryouko aka The Ninja Dragon~

I'm not certain how being an elf would help. SD might give the build different fighting options, but the race swap really only costs you a feat in the long run.

You really dont need Extra Stunning Fists. That could be the feat thats substituted, as well as Power Attack and Imp Power Attack.

Anyway of taking more charisma and giving the build divine shield and might? I'll look at home and see what I can do <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br>I was thinking of such a build and saw your build, but then I was a bit disappointed I didn't see them in it, no offense but now I just have more work heh <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Trax~

I haven't played this character for long time... I might will go back to this build and fix it. But I rather to wait until the next patch comes out, as I heard it fixes the Dragon Shape, giving them 6+ in claw attack, I think.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.

To be honest I don't really get the point of the one Cleric level!!!<br><br>Strengt and War domains special abilities both relies on CHA to be useful since the duraion is 5 rounds + CHA modifier. that would leave you with 30 seconds (maybe 24) of that effect ONCE per day - seems pretty useless to me.<br><br>Taking one more level of monk gets you an epic bonus feat.<br><br>I know this is more of a gimmic to get the highest results for some abilities and of course then it's valid enough.

If you went with a fighting class you could have a BAB of 16 instead of 14 (also taking cleric post-epic would get you 15 BAB). That would mean an extra attack per round, and you could get that armor prof. (although wouldnt that  nullify your huge monk ac bonus?) as well. You could get yourself epic weapon spec if you went 5 or 6 fighter. So one more attack per round and 6 more damage per hit.<br>You'd lose that monk bonus epic feat but gain the fighter one. And +4 ki strike really doesnt help you because people generally have either x/+3 or x/+5 physical resistance, so +3 ki strike is going to be just as good. Also with your starting stats, I'd suggest pumping wis all the way to 18. Dex, Strength and Con don't carry over into Dragon shape. If you dropped dex/con to 10 each, you could grab 18 wis and save two epic feats (which you could use for ki strike +4 and +5 perhaps?). I'd also suggest using all extra attribute points in wisdom because that's the only attribute that will carry over into your shape, giving you extra ac.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?
