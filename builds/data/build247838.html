Spell Swords seem to have made a comeback on the boards so I thought I'd throw this one on the pile.  The build was actually inspired by Darth vader from Star Wars and is my interpretation of what a Sith Lord might look like in NWN.<br><br>There were a few other builds that used this combo, but none that actually achieved 4 attacks per round.  There were a couple of Paladin / Sorcerer / RDD combo's with the same kind of level split, but most focused more heavily on the sorcerer class.  <br><br>Sith Lord<br><br>Playable 1 - 40 PvM<br><br>Alignment:  Any Evil<br><br>Sorcerer(20), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Blackguard(10), Human<br><br>STR: 14 (28)<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 14 (16)<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14 (16)<br>CHA: 16 (22)<br><br>01: Sorcerer(1): Power Attack, Cleave<br>02: Sorcerer(2)<br>03: Sorcerer(3): Still Spell<br>04: Sorcerer(4): CHA+1, (CHA=17)<br>05: Sorcerer(5)<br>06: Sorcerer(6): Empower Spell<br>07: Red Dragon Disciple(1)<br>08: Red Dragon Disciple(2): CHA+1, (STR=16), (CHA=18)<br>09: Red Dragon Disciple(3): Maximize Spell<br>10: Red Dragon Disciple(4): (STR=18)<br>11: Blackguard(1)<br>12: Blackguard(2): STR+1, Weapon Focus, (STR=19)<br>13: Blackguard(3)<br>14: Blackguard(4)<br>15: Blackguard(5): Divine Might<br>16: Blackguard(6): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>17: Blackguard(7)<br>18: Blackguard(8): Divine Shield<br>19: Blackguard(9)<br>20: Blackguard(10): STR+1, (STR=21)<br>21: Sorcerer(7): Epic Weapon Focus<br>22: Sorcerer(8)<br>23: Sorcerer(9)<br>24: Sorcerer(10): CHA+1, Epic Prowess, (CHA=19)<br>25: Sorcerer(11)<br>26: Sorcerer(12)<br>27: Sorcerer(13): Epic Reflexes<br>28: Sorcerer(14): CHA+1, (CHA=20)<br>29: Sorcerer(15)<br>30: Sorcerer(16): Toughness<br>31: Sorcerer(17)<br>32: Sorcerer(18): STR+1, (STR=22)<br>33: Sorcerer(19): Automatic Still Spell I<br>34: Sorcerer(20)<br>35: Red Dragon Disciple(5)<br>36: Red Dragon Disciple(6): STR+1, Automatic Still Spell II, (STR=23)<br>37: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=16)<br>38: Red Dragon Disciple(8)<br>39: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Automatic Still Spell III, (INT=16)<br>40: Red Dragon Disciple(10): STR+1, (STR=28), (CHA=22)<br><br><br>Hitpoints: 424 (544 Buffed with maximized &amp; empowered endurance)<br><br><br>Saving Throws ( ) - vs Spells<br> <br>Fortitude:  32 (41) |  41 (50) fully buffed	 <br>Will:       27 (36) |  30 (39) fully buffed<br>Reflex):    26 (35) |  29 (38) fully buffed<br><br><br>BAB: 26<br><br>AB (max, naked): 39 (melee), 27 (ranged)<br>Base      26<br>EWF       +3<br>EP        +1<br>Strenth   +9<br>2xBulls   +6<br>GMW       +5<br>Total     50<br><br>Max with True Strike = 65<br><br><br>Max Damage<br><br>Longsword        8<br>Strength        +9<br>2xBulls	        +6<br>GMW             +5<br>Divine Might    +9 (with empowered/maximized Eagle's)<br>Flame weapon   +14<br>Total           51 <br><br>Typical would be 36 (lose divine might &amp; average damage)<br><br><br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 18/29<br><br>Naked           18<br>Full Plate      +8<br>Tower Shield    +3<br>Cat's Grace     +1<br>Mage Armor      +2<br>Shield          +4<br>Shadow Shield   +5<br>Haste           +4<br>Divine Shield   +9 (with empowered/maximized Eagle's)<br>Total           54<br><br>Can reach over 70 with +5 gear &amp; +12 to Charisma<br><br><br>Skillpoints: 216<br><br>Concentration 40(43)<br>Discipline 43(52)<br>Hide 5(5)<br>Listen 10(9)<br>Lore 8(11)<br>Spellcraft 42(45)<br>Taunt 23(29)<br>Tumble 20(20)<br><br><br>Spells (Recommended)<br><br>Level 0 - 7/6<br>Acid Splash, Daze, Electric Jolt, Flare, Light, Ray of Frost, Resistance<br><br>Level 1 - 5/8<br>Grease, Mage Armor, Protection from Alignment, True Strike, Shield<br><br>Level 2 - 5/8<br>Bull's Strength, Cat's Grace, Eagle's Splendor, Endurance, Flame Weapon<br><br>Level 3 - 4/7 <br>Clarity, Greater Magic weapon, Haste, Lightning Bolt<br><br>Level 4 - 4/7<br>Elemental Shield, Evard's Black Tentacles, Ice Storm, Improved Invisbility<br><br>Level 5 - 4/7<br>Animate Dead, Bigby's Interposing Hand, Dominate Person, Mestil's Acid Sheath<br><br>Level 6 - 3/7<br>Bigby's Forceful Hand, Isaac's Greater Missle Storm, Greater Stoneskin<br><br>Level 7 - 3/6<br>Bigby's Grasping Hand, Great Thunderclap, Shadow Shield<br><br>Level 8 - 3/6<br>Bigby's Clenched Fist, Greater Sanctuary, Horrid Wilting<br><br>Level 9 - 3/6<br>Greater Spell Mantle, Mordenkainen's Disjunction, Wail of the Banshee <br><br><br>Advantages:<br>1) Good AB at 39 &amp; HP's at 424 for a spell sword.<br>2) Can get 35 taunt with +12 (32 without) which will get most characters without significant investment in concentration.<br>3) Good Saves especially buffed and RDD immunities.<br>4) Lots of castings per day (can you say regular, maximized, empowered and maximized &amp; empowered IGMS?)<br>5) Good melee damage output <br><br>Disadvantages:<br>1) Buffs can be dispelled (not as big a factor in mid to high magic settings).<br>2) Limited spell selection.<br>3) Feat starved compared to most spell swords that use Fighter/COT/Wizard.<br>4) Will have trouble with enemies that have spell resistance <br>5) Low spell DC's and caster level.<br><br><br><i>Title changed on OP's request - Kail Pendragon</i><br>_________________<br>In order to find his equal, an Irishman is forced to talk to<br>God.

When I read Sith Lord I thought on a strong killer Sith Marauder <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   well, not your fault... anyway, as for the "Sith Lord" part, the red wings are definitely going to seem weird.<br><br>Spellsword are getting quite popular, yeah, and they all seem to be quite ok, this one is strong too, however, there are some problems in your feats...<br><br>You get still for autosill, even if it's late, let's suppose you get in a level 40 environment where you actuall get to use it, so, I suggest you take Extended Spell, which is most valuable for those short term buffs, it's the most important metamagic on a buffer. Second, having sneak attack (even though it's only 3d6) I consider Knockdown to be very important, at least much more than Epic Reflexes, which, frankly, I don't know why you took that, you're too feat starved to take that.<br><br>Nice.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/25/06 17:09</span></i></p>

Hmmm... quite interesting. I do agree with Thax about the wings though. They just seem wrong, I can't quite put my finger on why though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  . I've actually been trying to make a Darth Maul build for a while now, but just haven't managed to be able to make a good STR based build with with 6 attacks, moderate damage and Epic dodge. That's enough about my build though.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Big Meph on 07/26/06 02:13</span></i></p>

You can't get 4 APR, the 3 autostills and an epic spell in a Sorc/RDD 10 build.  You don't have any bonus feats so you would need 18 Sorcerer levels by level 30. This would require 8 Sorcerer levels pre-epic, which means you can't take any RDD levels pre-epic and maintain 4 APR.  Since you need to be an epic sorcerer to take the epic spell, you need to take at least 3 more sorcerer levels after level 30, which leaves 7 levels for RDD.  If you can live with 3 APR, you can have it all.<br><br>That said, the build is pretty good.  I might drop empower spell for knockdown and epic reflexes for armor skin, but that's about it.  Not really my idea of a sith, but nicely donwe.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

I'd drop at least 1 BG and take an extra sorc for epic warding.  Nice build.<br><br>-pc
