If you don't like the extreme archer versions of Torias, here is a build of mine that is a bit of both. (Sorry if a build like this has been posted already. I'm not going through all pages again to check  )<br><br>Race: Elf<br>Starting Stats:<br>Begin Stats<br>STR 12<br>DEX 20<br>CON 10<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 8<br><br>Level progression:<br>1 Rogue Point-Blank Shot<br>2 Rogue<br>3 Rogue Rapid Shot<br>4 Rogue<br>5 Rogue<br>6 Rogue Weapon Focus Longbow<br>7 Rogue<br>8 Rogue<br>9 Wizard Dodge<br>10 AA<br>11 AA<br>12 AA *Expertise<br>13 AA<br>14 AA<br>15 AA *Improved Expertise<br>16 AA<br>17 AA<br>18 AA *Weapon Finesse<br>19 AA<br>20 Wizard<br>21 Rogue Epic Weapon Focus Longbow<br>22 Rogue Improved Evasion<br>23 Rogue<br>24 Rogue Great Dexterity I<br>25 Rogue Defensive Roll<br>26 AA<br>27 Rogue Epic Dodge<br>28 AA<br>29 AA<br>30 AA Great Dexterity II, Great Dexterity III<br>31 AA<br>32 AA<br>33 Rogue **Self-Concealment I<br>34 Rogue **Self-Concealment II<br>35 AA<br>36 Rogue **Self-Concealment III<br>37 AA Great Dexterity IV<br>38 Rogue<br>39 Rogue **Self-Concealment IV, **Self-Concealment V<br>40 AA<br><br>Important skills:<br>Tumble, Hide, Move Silent (Maximize these, also important for feats)<br>Also important are UMD, Spot, Listen, Search, and if you want to be a thief, Pick Pocket, Disable Traps, Open Locks etc. Your Charisma is rather low, so I didn't use any of the CHA based skills.<br><br>Level 40 Naked Stats:<br>STR 12<br>DEX 34<br>CON 10<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 8<br><br>HP 274(max)<br>AC 30<br>AC 43 with plain tower shield, short sword and improved expertise<br><br>Attack Bonus (with plain longbow and plain arrows):<br>+52/+47/+42/+37<br>+50/+50/+45/+40/+35 with Rapid Shot<br><br>Saving Throws<br>Fortitude 19<br>Reflex 35<br>Will 17<br><br>I build this character (ehhh, level 6 atm, in the world I play) not with PvP in mind, at least, not in fair one on one fights . I will be in party with some other rogues most of the time, so that's why I put in the improved expertise and weapon finesse. He can play the tank to enable his fellow rogues to deal sneak attack damage. When another tank is around, he has 10d6 worth of sneak attacks himself, and a very decent attack bonus to make sure those sneak attacks land.<br><br>The Pros:<br>Hard to hit. High AC combined with Epic Dodge and Self-Concealment V. You won't take a lot of hits. With short sword, towershield and Improved Expertise, you will be a excellent tank. Leaving melee when needed is easy well.<br>Very good To Hit with a longbow. Not as good as the reliable archer, but still a lot better then your average thief of fighter.<br><br>The Cons:<br>The non-reflex saving throws are mediocre at best. Be careful around spell users.<br>Your total hitpoints will be low. But imho the epic dodge and self-concealment make up for this.<br>You're not the biggest damage dealer. Damage reduction can become a serious problem, especially when combined with immunity to sneak attacks.<br><br>* I chose Improve Expertise and Weapon Finesse to become a tank for my fellow rogues. Feel free to exchange them for feats like Toughness and Called Shot for example. I am still debating myself if I need weapon finesse, it's not like my character will hit much with his short sword in expertise mode, maybe I will change it to Toughness and keep the Improved Expertise.<br><br>** Self-Concealment V. That's a lot of feats for a very good permanent effect. If they are worth it I don't know. They will definately enhance your survivability, as a tank, and as a ranged attacker. You could switch them to some Greater Dexterity and Armor Skin, to improve your To Hit and AC.<br><br>Zhoreb
