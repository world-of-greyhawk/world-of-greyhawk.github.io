It depends on the type of server you play on and your character.  Automatic quicken spell basically works like haste, allowing you to fire off more spells in a shorter amount of time, without wasting higher spell slots.  However, it does not stack with haste.  So if perma-haste items are the norm for you then this feat is worthless.  the automatic still spell line allows you to cast spells in armor without any penalties, and without wasting higher spell slots.  This is definately the one to get if you plan on wearing armor for your mage, or are making a spellsword type char.  This is useless if you dont plan on wearing armor though.  The auto silent spell line allows you to remove the verbal components without wasting higher spell slots.  I have not really used this epic feat that much, so I cant tell you the pro's and con's of it.  It does not matter what spell focus (evocation, necromancy, etc.) you are when deciding to use these feats, like I said at the begining, it depends on the items available on your server and the type of character you are playing.  Hope this helps out somewhat.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.
