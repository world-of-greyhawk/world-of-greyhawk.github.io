12 attacks per round is the maximum the game engine supports. Other than a monk however the maximum (without magical aid) you will get is 4 main hand(+16-20 BAB at level 20) and 2 off hand attacks(improved 2 handed attack). A monk however with a kama in the main hand (apprantly doesnt have to be a kama in the offhand) gets 6 main hand attacks and 2 offhand if he can get a BAB of +16 by level 20. So a 16 monk /4 fighter can do it (or paladin,ranger,weapon master etc) <br><br>Syrath
