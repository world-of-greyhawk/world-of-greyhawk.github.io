There is something uniquely satisfying in playing a good assassin build.  I've been mod-slumming with the Huntress in the last few days, and found her to be quite effective, efficient, and reasonably balanced.  Ultravision, Darkness, Improved Knockdown, Epic Weapon Specialization, Improved Invisibility, solid skill set, high stealth scores, high crit potential, UMD, good AC, excellent dualwielding AB, an impressive Death Attack DC at 38, and then topped with 13d6 Sneak with the capacity to launch 78d6 per round, the Huntress has a huge toolbox at her disposal.  She even manages to pull off some decent saves.  <br><br>With a list like that, what doesn't she have, you ask? Two things really.  Hide in Plain Sight, and Epic Dodge.  Frankly, if she had that, then everybody would want one, and she would be the quintessential Assassin build.  She certainly has enough ways to generate sneaks, so HiPS is really no great loss.  <br><br>Plenty of room is left in the Epic portion for PW customization.  With 9 Great Dex feats taken, one can easily drop two for Armor Skin and an Epic Save feat.  There is also room in the Skill Point section for customization.  If Craft Traps isn't viable, or Spellcraft not required due to items, she can easily make investments into Listen, Search, etc.<br><br>Human is chosen for race due to the skill-point hunger Assassins are afflicted with.  Dwarves are a close second.  Half-elves third.  All other races incur XP penalties.<br><br>What does a Death Attack DC 38 mean? It means that a 40th level warrior with a 29 Fort Save has a 24% chance of failing.  In testing, the Huntress, with no items at all, no buffs, completely naked, literally, with ordinary kukris, stealthed behind him, lands her first flurry, both hits.  The Warrior makes his first save with a 10+29=39.  Just made it.  His second roll, however, was a 7+29=36.  Poor guy, he didn't make that one.  He was a but a memory by the end of the next round....the long kiss goodnight.<br>_____<br><br><b>The Huntress</b>: Ranger10/Ftr4/Assassin26<br>Human<br>Alignment: Any/Evil<br><b>Playable 1-40, PvM</b><br><br>Str14<br>Int14<br>Wis12<br>Dex15(34)<br>Con14<br>Chr8<br><br>1 Ranger1, Exotics, Knockdown, FE<br>2 Fighter1, WF: Kukris<br>3 Fighter2, Blindfighting, Weapon Finesse<br>4 Ranger2, Dex16<br>5 Ranger3<br>6 Assassin1, Stealthy<br>7 Assassin2, (Ghostly Visage)<br>8 Assassin3, Dex17<br>9 Ranger4, Improved Knockdown, (Ultravision)<br>10 Ranger5, FE<br>11 Assassin4<br>12 Assassin5, Improved Crit: Kukri, Dex18, (Darkness)<br>13 Ranger6<br>14 Ranger7<br>15 Ranger8, Iron Will<br>16 Ranger9, Dex19<br>17 Assassin6<br>18 Assassin7, Toughness, (Invisibility)<br>19 Assassin8<br>20 Fighter3, Dex20<br>21 Assassin9, EWF: Kukris, (Improved Invisibility)<br>22 Assassin10<br>23 Assassin11<br>24 Fighter4, WS/EWS: Kukri, Dex21<br>25 Assassin12<br>26 Assassin13<br>27 Assassin14, Great Dex I, II<br>28 Assassin15, Dex24<br>29 Assassin16<br>30 Assassin17, Great Dex III<br>31 Assassin18, Great Dex IV<br>32 Assassin19, Dex27<br>33 Assassin20, Great Dex V<br>34 Assassin21<br>35 Assassin22, Great Dex VI<br>36 Assassin23, Great Dex VII, Dex31<br>37 Assassin24<br>38 Assassin25<br>39 Ranger10, Epic Prowess, Great Dex VIII<br>40 Assassin26, Great Dex IX, Dex34<br><br>AB: 44<br>Dualwielding Kukris: 42/37/33/27/42/37<br>AC: 30 (33 w/Tower Shield)<br>Death Attack DC: 38<br>Sneak Attack: 13d6 (78d6 per round)<br>Hit Points: 410<br><br>Skill Points: 294<br><br>Hide: 43 (57)<br>Move Silently: 43 (57)<br>Tumble: 40<br>UMD: 36 (35)<br>Set Traps: 23 (25)<br>Discipline: 42 (44)<br>Craft Traps: 23 (25)<br>Spellcraft: 18 (20)<br>Search: 5 (7)<br>Heal: 1 (2)<br>Disable Traps: 1 (13)<br>Open Locks: 1 (3)<br><br>Fort: 23 (27)<br>Will: 19 (23)<br>Reflex: 32 (36)<br>______<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 05/27/10 21:05</span></i></p>

The Dark Stalker is good assassin, but not the best.  You are correct that at Lvl 40, the Dark Stalker may be better, but only under certain conditions.

I assumed in the Sneak Attack category that Improved Sneak wasn't nerfed, but as it stands right now, anybody building a Dark Stalker would have to toss in some Great Dex feats.  Also, Epic Dodge in my mind is the great equalizer, especially when facing melee builds.  At lvl 39 and 40, I would say that makes all the difference in a direct comparison.  But for those first 38 levels, I don't think he can hold a candle to the Huntress.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I tend to build my sneak attackers to be a little beefy so I can stand toe-to-toe with opposition.  In so doing, not all attacks are going to be sneak attacks, and without WS/EWS not coming until Lvl24, that leaves only a 14Strength to help with the damage output.  Celebrating a 15-20 crit Range by level 12 and with ITWF coming at Lvl16, it makes a marked improvement in damage output. <br><br>Second, Exotic Weapon proficiency is quite useful.  She can now use any weapon in the game, which gives her much needed versatility in dealing with specialized opponents.  How many times has someone found that Exotic Bastard sword that deals +X damage to dragons, and the end-boss is a dragon, and the party is looking at each other and asking, "Do you have Exotic? I don't have Exotic..."<br><br>Third, using UMD, it is possible for to cast Keen on a Kurki since they are a slashing weapon.  Daggers are piercing.<br><br>Fourth, she's not really feat-starved.  Sure, it would be nice to have another feat, but Exotic is probably the best investment, particulary pre-epic.<br><br>Fifth, kukris just look a lot sharper and cooler than daggers or shortswords.  <br><br>But having said all that, one can always drop Exotic and take daggers or shortswords.  I have a pure Assassin build that enjoys maces.  I think in most builds weapons are really a personal choice and preference, and really don't affect the outcome of a build.  Yet in this build, which has feats to spare, if you can get Exotic I don't really see a reason not to take it.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 09/06/05 17:39</span></i></p>

That goes for all finesse builds, not just this one.  A Ranger/SD/Assassin will have just as difficult time with the above-mentioned creatures as the next guy.  HiPS, while it will keep them alive, isn't going to take the enemy out.  All else being equal in a situation vs. crit immune/true seeing, I would give the Huntress the edge over a DarkStalker variant due to more attacks and just more base damage, hit points and AC.  While she doesn't have Shadow Evade, she does have Cat's Grace and a few other nifty Ranger spells to help out.<br><br>Bare in mind that I think I know what you are trying to say.  I absolutely share your disappointment with the state of the current Dark Stalker.  He has grown old, has wizened somewhat, and is long in the tooth.  A new breed of Assassin crouches in the shadows of the horizon, watching, knowing, waiting, to knife the old man in the back, and with a grim smile stand above his lifeless corpse and take his place on the Epic Page. <br><br>Yar!<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I really enjoyed this build while playing at a level 40 PW. But now - moving to a lvl 30 capped PW I have to adjust it a bit.<br><br>What should I consider, when cutting down this builds idea to level 30. All that is gained after level 30 is Dex and Epic Prowess? So nothing too crucial.<br><br>I'd actually build it the same way but stop at Level 30. Is it worth to sacrifice 1 Greater Dex to take a Ranger Level for Discipline?<br><br>But if I didn't take the ranger level I'd end up with odd Dex. Or I had to cut down on an ability score to start with 16 Dex. (I'd take Con I think)<br>Any suggestions?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By johnstonee on 05/09/10 12:17</span></i></p>

Holy Crap!  I think this is the very first entry of the Dwarven Assassin's guild!  If im not mistaken, this is the build that started the chaos that lasted in 2005 thru 2006...  You shall be hunted and gutted from bringing up this evilness!!! LOL  jk<br><br>Thanks man!  I forgot about this guy.  Hey, we never made an actual Dwarven assassin's guild, did we Griz?  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">
