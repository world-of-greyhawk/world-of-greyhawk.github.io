I wanted to do a shifter build that did not rely on the Monk class to get good defensive capabilities and that could still obtain both the Rakshasha and Dragon Forms.  I thought of HIPS and Epic Dodge as a good alternative to the speed and wisdom AC of the monk class.  There was only one other build that used this combination of classes, M1ke47's Hidden lord<br> <br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "205255", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>That build also got Epic Dodge but went for SCV over the improved forms <br><br>Anyway, for your critique ...<br><br>Hidden Tiger / Dodging Dragon<br><br>Playable 1 - 40 PvM, Level 40 PvP<br><br>Druid(8), Shadowdancer(13), Shifter(19), Halfling<br><br>Alignment: Any Neutral<br><br>Base Stats<br><br>STR: 7<br>DEX: 19 (25)<br>CON: 8<br>WIS: 18 (30)<br>INT: 8<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Level 01: Druid(1): Iron Will<br>Level 02: Druid(2)<br>Level 03: Druid(3): Alertness<br>Level 04: Druid(4): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br>Level 05: Druid(5)<br>Level 06: Druid(6): Extend Spell<br>Level 07: Druid(7)<br>Level 08: Druid(8): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br>Level 09: Shifter(1): Weapon Finesse<br>Level 10: Shifter(2)<br>Level 11: Shifter(3)<br>Level 12: Shifter(4): WIS+1, Dodge, (WIS=21)<br>Level 13: Shifter(5)<br>Level 14: Shifter(6)<br>Level 15: Shifter(7): Mobility<br>Level 16: Shifter(8): WIS+1, (WIS=22)<br>Level 17: Shadowdancer(1)<br>Level 18: Shadowdancer(2): Toughness<br>Level 19: Shadowdancer(3)<br>Level 20: Shadowdancer(4): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br>Level 21: Shifter(9): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=24)<br>Level 22: Shifter(10)<br>Level 23: Shifter(11)<br>Level 24: Shifter(12): WIS+1, Great Wisdom II, (WIS=26)<br>Level 25: Shifter(13): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=27)<br>Level 26: Shifter(14)<br>Level 27: Shifter(15): Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=28)<br>Level 28: Shifter(16): WIS+1, Outsider Shape, (WIS=29)<br>Level 29: Shifter(17)<br>Level 30: Shifter(18): Great Dex I, (DEX=20)<br>Level 31: Shadowdancer(5)<br>Level 32: Shifter(19): WIS+1, Dragon Shape, (WIS=30)<br>Level 33: Shadowdancer(6): Great Dex II, (DEX=21)<br>Level 34: Shadowdancer(7)<br>Level 35: Shadowdancer(8)<br>Level 36: Shadowdancer(9): DEX+1, Great Dex III, (DEX=23)<br>Level 37: Shadowdancer(10)<br>Level 38: Shadowdancer(11)<br>Level 39: Shadowdancer(12): Great Dex IV, (DEX=24)<br>Level 40: Shadowdancer(13): DEX+1, Epic Dodge, (DEX=25)<br><br><br>Hitpoints: 320 Max every level<br><br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 23/32/30<br><br>BAB: 25<br><br>AB (max, naked): 33 (melee), 34 (ranged)<br><br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 26/29<br><br>Spell Casting: Druid(4)<br><br>Skillpoints: 155 (Definitely starved here, stat requirements to achived ED &amp; Dragon form hurt here)<br><br>Discipline 8(6), Hide 43(50), Move Silently 43(52), Tumble 40(47)<br><br><br>Dragon Shape<br><br>STR: 48 (55 buffed with Bull's &amp; Blood Frenzy)<br>DEX: 36<br>CON: 32<br>WIS: 30<br>INT: 8<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 900<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 35/32/35<br>Max AB = 25 + 19(Strength) + 6 Natural (Claws) -2 (Huge size)= 48<br>AC = 10 + 8(Tumble) + 13(Dex) + 20(Dodge) -2 (Huge size)= 49<br><br><br>Rakshasha Form<br><br>STR: 17 (24 buffed)<br>DEX: 20<br>CON: 8<br>WIS: 30<br>INT: 8<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 350<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 28/32/30<br>Max AB = 25 + 7 = 32<br>AC = 10 + 8(Tumble) + 5(Dex) + 12(Dodge) = 35<br><br>I ran this build through the Halls of Epic Training Module and it cleaned up everything that came at it in Dragon form.  <br><br>Surprisingly, a straight level 40 Rogue build lasted the longest and ended up inflicting the most damage against the build.  <br><br>It is still untested in Rakshasha form but I don't expect the same kind of results.

I like. Maybe you might want to take Weapon Finesse in place of Alertness, then take Alertness in place of Extend Spell, and extend spell in place of weapon finesse <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> . Always nice for playablity to have Weapon Finesse early.<br><br>Well done.<br><br>Kurth

I corrected a couple of mistakes with shifted stats. First the Dragon is Huge size, so it gets -2 AB/AC because of that. Second, bonus AC from shifted forms is always Dodge AC and never Natural. Which is a pity since Natural AC is not capped (Natural AC not Natural AC Enhancement!) while Dodge is.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Unto to the darkness<br>I commend my soul<br>Never shall I repent<br>Never shall I be saved<br><br>I'll go into the House of Death<br>Before my last breath<br>My enemies all shall die!

Thanks for the correction Kail.  Didn't think to take size into account and didn't realize the shifted AC bonus was dodge AC.  Makes a big difference when you start to merge equipment.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif"><br>_________________<br>In order to find his equal, an Irishman is forced to talk to<br>God.

How does this fair against builds that use monk levels instead? Does the epic dodge feat more than cater for the loss of AC.  <br><br>I do like this build and I guess it makes a good change to see a dragon build with a different element to it.

The build fares well, one on one.  Epic Dodge loses a lot of it's value when you end up facing multiple foes.  I'd have to give the edge to a monk build in that environment.  The effectiveness of HIPS is also very dependent on the true seeing environment.  Epic Dodge also comes late in the build, while the Monk AC bonus would be useful for most of the build life of other shifters.<br><br>At the end of the day, I still think the monk build is superior, but this was a nice change of pace.<br>_________________<br>Him?
