<b>Playable from levels 1-40... PvM or PvP</b><br><br>With the recent glut of rogue (assassin)/mages I thought I would post one that has level 9 spells.  The end result is a pretty good DEX based spellsword, that has all of the versatility of a rogue and a strong magical punch.  It should work well in no or low magic environments.  It should be playable through all levels, but signigicant amounts of skill points need to be saved at certain levels, so the build may be lacking some skills during the epic levels. <br><br>Similar builds include: Crispy Critter's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "152342", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Arcane Trickster</a>, Xitooner's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "179635", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Very Versatile Kensai</a> and Mauvais Guillam's <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_versatilekensai.html" target="_blank">Versatile Kensai</a>.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-Level 9 Illusionist spells.  His caster level is high enough that he can bypass item based SR with a Mordenkainen's Disjunction.  He is fairly resistant to greater dispels as well, though he is susceptible to mordenkainen's disjunction.<br>-Epic Dodge.  Always good to be able to avoid an attack.<br>-Good Reflex Save and Improved evasion.  He doesn't have to worry about spells with a reflex save for half damage<br>-7D6 sneak attack.  With improved knockdown and mage spells like darkness, timestop, the bigby's hand spells etc. he can land many sneak attacks against his enemies.<br>-Good skill set.  He can sneak around, find and disable/recover traps, set traps and open locks.  He can use knock on high DC locks and he can use true seeing to spot concealed opponents.<br>-Fair AB.  It could be better but a 40 AB (38 while dual wielding) is pretty high for a rogue wizard.  He can use true strike to augment this and land a knockdown for some sneak attacks.  In a no or low magic setting, the bonus from greater magic weapon should make him quite competetive.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br><br>-Low Spell DCs.  He is reliant on spells that have no DCs.<br>-Low hitpoints. 354 is high for this class mix, but low for a character.<br>-Mediocre Fortitude and Will saves.  Against spells he is pretty good, but the base saves could be better.<br><br><b>Arcane Scout</b> <br><br><i>Race</i> Human<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Any non evil<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 12<br>DEX 16<br>CON 14<br>WIS 8<br>INT 16<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 28, 32, 36 and 40 go to Dexterity<br>Level 20 goes to INT<br><br><i>Leveling Guide</i><br>Levels 1-8 Rogue<br>Levels 9-10 Illusionist<br>Levels 11-12 Champion of Torm<br>Level 13 Rogue<br>Levels 14-15 Champion of Torm<br>Level 16 Rogue<br>Levels 17-18 Champion of Torm<br>Levels 19-20 Rogue<br>Levels 21-28 Illusionist<br>Level 29 Champion of Torm<br>Levels 30-38 Illusionist<br>Level 39 Rogue<br>Level 40 Champion of Torm<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Champion of Torm 8<br>Illusionist 19<br>Rogue 13<br><br><i>Feats</i><br>Level 1: Knockdown, Toughness<br>Level 3: Weapon Finesse<br>Level 6: Weapon Focus (Short Sword)<br>Level 9: Blind-Fight<br>Level 12: Improved Knockdown, Two-Weapon Fighting<br>Level 15: Ambidexterity, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>Level 16: Improved Evasion<br>Level 18: Extend Spell, Improved Critical (Short Sword)<br>Level 21: Epic Weapon Focus (Short Sword)<br>Level 23: Great Intelligence I<br>Level 24: Great Dexterity I<br>Level 27: Great Dexterity II<br>Level 28: Great Intelligence II<br>Level 30: Great Dexterity III<br>Level 33: Great Dexterity IV<br>Level 34: Great Intelligence III<br>Level 36: Great Dexterity V<br>Level 39: Defensive Roll, Epic Dodge<br>Level 40: Epic Prowess<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 12<br>DEX 30<br>CON 14<br>WIS 8<br>INT 20<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>Hit Points</i> 354 (max every level)<br><br><i>Final Saves</i> (Vs.

Ah, crud.  You can't take CoT until you get AB 7.  You don't get AB from illusionist until Level 3.  So that has to be adjusted.

Thanks, Cinn and Stravinksy, my apologies to Mith.  The grimoire confirms that.  Seems like when I build in the game that they come at the 3rd and 4th levels of the 4 level cycle.

Does EWF stack on WF such that WF + EWF = +3 to AB?  Otherwise, I would always take Epic Prowess before EWF just for principle's sake.

Cool.  That changes some things, then.  <br><br>I built the last 21 levels this way:<br><br>20) Rogue 12 (DEX 21)<br>21) WIZ 3 GrDexI (DEX 22); <br>22) WIZ 4 <br>23) WIZ 5 Gr.Int. (17)<br>24) WIZ 6 GrDex (DEX 23) (DEX 24)<br>25) WIZ 7 <br>26) WIZ 8 <br>27) WIZ 9 GrDex II (DEX 25) <br>28) WIZ 10 GrInt III (INT 18) (DEX 26) <br>29) CoT 7 <br>30) WIZ 11 EWF (Rapier) <br>31) WIZ 12<br>32) WIZ 13 (DEX 27) <br>33) WIZ 14 GrDex IV (DEX 28) <br>34) WIZ 15 GrInt IV (19)<br>35) WIZ 16 <br>36) WIZ 17 GrDex V (DEX 29) (DEX 30) <br>37) WIZ 18<br>38) WIZ 19 <br>39) Rogue 13 Defensive Roll; Epic Dodge <br>40) CoT 8 Epic Prowess (INT 20)<br><br>This way you have fewer levels with an odd numbered dexterity (obviously, I built it with rapier as the weapon, and I built it elf).<br><br>I guess the tradeoff is +2 EWF which more than offsets the delay in bonus for AB/AC.  You get a few (6 or so?) less skill points by switching your ability increase for intelligence from level 20 to 40 but I did not notice any other problems with that move.

Then rapper's delight for the 'thief skills' -- I generally rely on the invisible line of spells for hide/move silently, so you have roughly 80 skill points there to play around with.  Your dexterity bonus allows you to take fewer skill slots with open lock and set trap than you might otherwise.  I'd keep set trap high, open lock low.  Since disable trap and search aren't based on dexterity, you need to run those higher.  If need be, my familiar is a pixie.

We should probably keep this discussion to Mith's original build, and possibly post your elf version as a separate build (giving Mith credit of course).  One thing I wanted to note though:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/21/05 20:06:34 (GMT) -- Ithacan<br><br>UMD 40 (39) [+40]</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>You final UMD including the CHA modifier should always be a multiple of 5, because UMD skill only gets better in jumps of 5.

I like this build but I'm thinking of using a halfling and daggers. Could I do that and still stay close to this build concept? At first glance I think I would just need to adjust the base attributes and that would in turn affect some of the epic lvl feats?<br>_________________<br>Chars:<br>Morfin<br>Wili

As halfling you can start with:<br><br>STR 12<br>DEX 17<br>CON 14<br>WIS 8<br>INT 16<br>CHA 8<br><br>You can delay a non-epic feat (extend spell/blind fight/thoughess?) to trade it at epic levels for great Dex V and voilá, you end with same stats and feats. Plus 1 extra AB and 1 extra AC (and being weaker to KD).<br>You also get 43 less skillpoints, It is up to you which skill you wish to discard (Unlock and untrap?).<br>_________________<br>HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh.

I guess as a halfling his KD and IKD would not work too well either. I guess I should stick with a human then. Ah well, I just like the little guys.
