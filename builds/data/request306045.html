I'm trying to make a dwarven spellsword(axe) based around Stravinsky00's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "198477", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Arcane Blade of Torm</a> buid. Dual-wielding dwarven waraxes though. <br><br>1 - I can't seem to take EWS: Dwarven Waraxe as the final CoT feat. Not sure why.

stravs build is old.  i am not sure of this, but it is quite possible that ews was changed in a patch.  Otherwise i cant say.  It is a solid twf build, though i would suggest handaxes (ala maxi suggestions) vs dwarfaxe.<br><br>With a spellsword, you arent really a heavy caster for offensive damage.  Atleast, without eldritch knight, why would you want to be.  What i am saying is that you are using the spells MOSTLY for buffs, ie, shields and the like.  THUS, Extended becomes your friend.  Also, if you have room, and gear doesnt give you the stat boosts, max or empower could also be good.  You have still already, which is a must for auto still.<br><br>Basically, you are looking at doing a cleric with wizard buffs instead of divine buffs.  THere is a flaw with that, being cleircs have way better buffs being they actually ARE caster fighters, but thats beside the point.   IOW, dont look to spell penetration feats cuz you shouldnt be layin down 8 max IGMS if you are a fighter mage!  If that's what you want, then go max wiz with high int and all those bells and whistles.  It is unfortunate that nwn vanilla doesnt really have an option for a real fighter mage.  It really hurts to have to give up spell levels for every fighter level.  SOrry, i miss my ol' game <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>hope that helps<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

"Prior to version 1.69, epic weapon specialization in the dwarven waraxe could not be taken on a champion of Torm level."<br><br>Are you in version 1.69?

Your suggestion for handaxes has merit – less dual penalty and frees up a feat (no need for exotic), but – there is just something about a dwarf dual wielding the dwarven waraxe I find appealing, and I often go for it with my dual dwarves. Trust me, once you try it you won’t want to go back to those sissy “elvish” handaxes. <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;With a spellsword, you arent really a heavy caster for offensive damage.

I usually play one or a druid when making a ‘finger-wiggler’. Mostly for ease of spell selection,  you’ll get no argument from me that the cleric isn’t an uber-powered machine.

I’m on 1.69 but have only tried to build this in the spreadsheet thus far (and the feat wasn’t able to be taken). I’ll try it now in a builder and get back to confirm if it now can be taken in 1.69 or not. I’m hoping so. <br><br>Cheers.<br><br>WK
