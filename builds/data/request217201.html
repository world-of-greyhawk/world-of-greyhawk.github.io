It's called the Concealed Wall (DwD 22/Rogue 16 /FTR 2). You can get also ED but that means lowering the DwD levels (and therefore DR). Might be worth giving a look at it

There's a lot of variants on your theme in that thread (maybe go for one with epic dodge, SC IV?)<br><br>I tried the puzzle too to try and get SC V/ED but you really can't get it without taking more rogue since you do need the four GD to really qualify in time. That would mean you'd need 2 more rogue bonus feats and that'd mean rogue 24 at least, I think. Or you could possibly try for Rogue 19/ SD 5/ DWD 14 but that means losing general feats but get HiPS. <br><br>Either way, it's dropping DWD levels a lot and losing feats, DR and HPs, but you'd also gain sneak attack die (quite a lot especially with rogue 24) which I didn't really see mentioned. It would be defensive more in the concealment category and more offensive sneaking-wise.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

AB 46 with a mundane rapier is out of reach though, maximun I got was 43..."just" 3 points off the mark <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br>Well, I guess I have to post the other 3 variants then...<br><br>Cheers<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò
