The Dragon Prince- Barbarian (15), Druid (15), Champion of Torm (10)<br><br>Machiavelli depicted that it was better if a prince were feared than love, which is the essential scope of this build.

There is no alignment change in the build.  The divine wrath affects ranged shots as well as dragon melee. Terrifying rage has a DC of 60 + 1d10 at level 40.<br><br>Playability: Use animal companion from the start and then start relying on wildshape.  After one successful disarm future disarms will increase your AB and blind fight will help you versus concealment. Use stoneskin to penetrate damage reduction.  As levels increase you can start using the rages to help your wildshape forms as well as drinking potions to replenish buffs.  The high wisdom will help the DC of your low level spells. Don't let combat get too long.  Playability gets difficult in the mid epic levels.<br><br><br>Disadvantages:<br>Immunity to fear (part of immunity to mind spells) will negate the terrifying rage paralysis for those under his level as well as the attack and save decrease for those of his level or higher (up to two times his level).<br>Immunity to paralysis (part of freedom of movement) will negate the terrifying rage paralysis for those under his level.<br><br><br>Though in PvP the plethora of immunities can make a tremendous difference as one has to have immunity to fear or to paralysis to avoid paralysis, in PvM most monster skins that have immunity to one often have immunity to the other, thus it would act in PvM almost exactly as a true fear would (except for the duration).

Why not take 12 Barbarian pre-epic?  That would either A) net you +1 BAB, or B) grant you two more CoT feats at epic levels.<br><br>I'm not sure you gain anything from going 8 Barbarian pre-epic, beyond maybe playability (though I'm not convinced 8 Druid is better than 12 Barbarian pre-epic).

A high AB with only 8 Str isn't going to do wonders.  It also forces dragon shape to be taken later.  I have tried such a build in my pretesting.  It was 16Barb/10COT/14Druid.  Dragon Shape at 39, the Rage much earlier and level 40 was barbarian giving a +1 to the terrifying rage DC.  This build did not have extend spell nor brew potion and instead took WF longbow and Point Blank.  When I get a chance I'll post it as a reply for comparison.

In general increasing the barbarian preepic will force dragon shape to be taken much later and is often best changing the split to 16 Barbarian so that a barbarian level can be taken at level 40 (right after dragon shape) to maximize intimidate for the terrifying rage.

So, a dragon with Divine Wrath and Terrifying Rage.<br><br>Taking the dragon shape early is far more important than a few BAB, you only need to raise BAB to get 4 APR. Without dragon shape you have regular wildshape (not even Dire shapes, those are at Druid level 12) to level up, I'd take 12 Druid pre-epic for those Dire Shapes, they get higher stats, I somewhat doubt that your ranged attack will work, you deal a lot of more damage with spells than with a bow. The most playable way is always higher Druid but you would lose Terrifying Rage for it.<br><br>It's nice but I wouldn't take Disarm without Improved Disarm, giving your enemies AoOs every time you use it is not nice. I'd easily change Brew Potion or Extra Smiting for Improved Disarm.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

You've obviously never played a Druid 14 dragon, I have and it's one of the hardest builds to level up until you get dragon shape (considering good builds, not crappy ones). The only playable dragons IMO are heavy Druid (to use Elder Elementals until you get dragon shapes) or Shifters (lots of useful shifts on the way). CoT helps a lot to get dragon shape sooner, but it's normally not enough.<br><br>All dragon AB sucks? hardly, any dragon has around +45 AB, which is good on any low magical environment (only an idiot would play a dragon on a high magical environment, no offense), strong good dragons get about +55, Cleric dragons can buff even higher (around +65) for short durations.<br><br>I agree that any dragon with Monk levels will obviously beat the crap out of dragons without Monk levels, the difference in AC and APR is way too high.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

That was uncalled for, there's no need to degrade other people's builds just because they're not strong, there's more into the game than just strength, don't post here if you're going to do so, not everyone has to be an uber builder whenever you get to read their builds.

As noted, SKIPPNUTZ, these builds are generally meant to be played from level 1 and are not geared towards a 'spawned at level 40 PvP' environment, which is what it appears your comments are leaning towards (forgive me if I'm wrong). In that type of environment, there's very little variation in what you can choose as an uber build and still be competetive. In fact, many people enjoy playing their character <i>up to</i> level 40, then retiring that one and starting another. <br><br>You'd do well to read the build description and take note of what environment/playstyle the build's designed for before taking the author to task for not building for something different. You'd be even better served to reconsider insulting other members of the guild.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Cinnaber is right. Despite the description for knockdown there is no AB bonus/penalty for difference in size.  You get a -4 to knockdown regardless.  So improved knockdown is only gives any benefit if your size is medium or less.  If your size is large or greater it improved knockdown is the same as knockdown.

Yeah, they made it so that you can't bug the game, if your AB could icrease while spamming Knockdown compared to regular hits it would be very cheap.<br><br>On the other hand, dragons are pretty nice resisting knockdown, size does work for that.

Hmmm... Looks like they did the same thing to disarm.  Well the disarm would have boosted the AB one patch ago, which is when I tested it.  So it looks like improved disarm might not be worth it since I will probably only make one attempt on a target for the weapon.

Skippy, we all appreciate that you're trying to help, but c'mon, Mate.

oops, sorry, Bromium; for some reason, could've sworn it was you who tested the unarmed on various shapes (heh heh, don't know why on earth I would think it would be you when it comes to dem shifter types <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">    <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   <br><br>My apologies; I remembered the thread, just not the tester (sorry, guys). In that particular thread, it was Tatooed Monk who, in responding to a question regarding monks (unarmed vs. weapon when it comes to disarming), had the following to say about it:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 05/11/07 19:49 (GMT) -- Tattoed Monk<br><br>... unarmed disarm attempts are made at no penalty or bonus regardless of the weapon size you are trying to take. It's as if it counts the disarm attempt as against the opponents hand rather than against their weapon. Kail discovered this when we were working on a disarming Dragon Shape build - we thought it would get a bonus to disarm since the dragon claw is considered a huge weapon, but it got no bonus when we checked the combat log. Then we checked disarm attempts while in human shape and found the same thing.<br><br>TM</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>_________________<br>"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good [people] to do nothing" -- Edmund Burke, Philosopher and Politician (1729-1797)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 09/08/07 04:46</span></i></p>
