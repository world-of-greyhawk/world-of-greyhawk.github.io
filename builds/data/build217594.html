<i>Rages and fights quite nicely from the shore at lvl 1 to the bridge at lvl 40. PvM build.</i><br><br>Their raid had been a success. They had pushed their longships ashore just after the break of dawn. Even with scouts out the Anglomen would have had problems seeing them pull ashore, a bright sun at their backs saw to that. Once the boats were on land, chief Harald Ironbeard posted a few stout men to keep watch at the ships, while the rest of his men started a running march towards the village. They were carrying only their weapons and shields, their upper bodies bare. Their armor was left in the ships, since the sun were already warm and bright. At one point not far from the shore they had to cross a deep and wild river. A bridge spanned across it. It was quite thin, having room for only two or three warriors walking beside each other. <br><br>At this point Harald feared an ambush, but none was to be seen. None to strange really, they weren't exactly awaiting someone from across the Ginnunga Sea.<br><br>The villagers were busy doing their chores for the morning, when the vikings came over the hilltop. The villagers were standing still in disbelief at first, but suddenly they burst into action. Warriors close by gathered at the outskirts of the village to meet the charge while others scrambled in the backgound. The vikings hit the first row of defenders full force and their numbers dwindled quickly. Defenders approached them scattered an unorganized, making the compact shield fortress of the Vikings to a small fortress of death.<br><br>Most of  the civilians were out of the way, when they heard a big man yell: "RETREAT! GATHER ON ME! RETREAT!"<br>He did a running withdrawal, and many warriors joined up on him, running away from the village. A few men chased the fleeing force trying to dispose as many as possible before they got away. Archers sent volleys after them, while Haralds men plundered and gathered what valuables and food they could. After a short time they could see the villagers had organized their forces, getting ready for a counter attack. Harald saw that they were still badly outnumbered, so he yelled an order "Back to the Longships, do what we trained."<br>Many men were carrying loot, and some were carrying their fallen. The archers remained behind to slow the oncoming counterattack, sending volleys of arrows. That didn't slow the villagers, furious at this humiliation, and eager to get their life-important goods back. Once the villagers had almost closed the distance, the archers too, turned and ran. A few fell with arrows in their backs, but the rest quickly gained ground , as they only had their bows to carry.<br><br>When the vikings reached the bridge Harald started organizing their movement, sending his men across the bridge in a long line. when they were across the bridge he realized their followers were to close. "We will need to make a stand here" he stated "They are to close, we won't have time to get the ships into the water..." He started naming men to make a stand. He planned on doing a fighting withdrawal, giving some of his men enough time to get the boats into the water, and then perhaps help the survivors on board. It would be tough, but it was the only way.<br><br>"Chief Harald!" a deep voice broke his line of orders. It was Helfdane the Furious, his best warrior. "I will hold them at the bridge, their arrows will not hurt me, and I can hold the bridge while you get the goods loaded and the ships sailing". "No way, Helfdane. Are you mad. It's no way for you to get on board then, and even you will not defeat all those men!" Harald stated angrily. " I know" Helfdane replied, stating the obvious. "Tomorrow I will sit at Odins table in Valhalla. Now go! Don't waste any more time!!".<br> "As you will my friend, you will be missed. The skalds will sing your glory, and we will drink to your bravery when we return home" With those parting words Harald ran to the ships never looking back, again yelling orders.<br><br>Helfdane stepped on to the middle of the bridge, his huge wooden shield in one hand, and his big axe in the other. A volley of arrows struck the lone figure, many hitting his shield,. A few got past, but all they did was scratch him. Helfdane started screaming. It was deep screams of primal fury, making many attackers halt their charge even retreating. He stood there, eyes bloodshot of anger, and slamming his axe repeatedly against his shield.<br>It was so intimidating, the warchief couldn't get his men to attack at first, so instead he charged onto the bridge himseøf. Raising his huge sword above his head, slashing at Helfdane with all his might. Helfdane blocked the blow who shattered his shield. Half a second later his counterblow sent the warchiefs head into the river. He kicked the body into the river after it and grinned. It took even a little longer for the attackers to attack him, but soon they felt confidence in numbers and attacked him on the bridge. Helfdanes position made it difficult for his attackers to get at him more then one or two at a time. <br><br>By the time all the blows and injuries drained the life out of him 16 men were dead or dying at his feet. With his last breath he looked over his shoulder, seeing the elegant ships at full sails, quickly gaining speed. Odin would be pleased. Then all went black. The song of the Valkyries were all he could hear......<br>_________<br><br>Another Norse build from me. A berserker this time, as a Viking should be. The story is based on an actual Viking saga I have read once, where 1 viking held the bridge while his friends fled to safety. He killed 16 men before he died, have an axe stuck in his skull among other wounds. In his original incarnation he was Bb28/Bard4/Fighter 8. I found no room for Bard, the Vikings didn't sing in fury, like the Dwarves do. I added some more feats instead, though the bard lvls increased his power. 4 more AC, spellcraft, and that song-a-doodle-dee. I do not build so much for cheese anymore as I did earlier, tho.<br><br>Human, NG.

Terrifying rage should paralyze a few opponents allowing time to hack them up. His saves might be a problem, except his Fort. I said it's a PvM build, but it's somewhat usable in PvP, only he plays few strings. It's just that he plays those real good. In a low magic world he would become qite nice in PvP to. One time I was attacked by an assassin HipS'ter (it happens) I managed to survive the initial Death attack, and immediately went into Rage and managed to paralyze him. After that he was mincemeat. A good and prepared HipSter will cause you trouble, but a ***y one is going down bad.In a world where everyone gets +12 to STR and CON, Barbarians do not come to their right.<br>  It's a fun and easy character to play, and as i stated taking 4 Bard levels makes small wonders. If you do that sacrifice two dex for more INT and skill points, f.ex spellcraft for better saves, or some detection skills. Take all Bard levels VERY late tho, since you will get an xp-penalty. and it will also cost you feats. Choose wisely, because there aren't really any epic to spare.<br><br>Another note, this isn't a min/maxed build, since I only utilize two classes, but it suits the rp theme fine as it is. The Berserker. It would be more powerful with Dwarf or Half Orc to, none of those would incur xp penalty.<br>Now, hit me. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 10/30/05 18:15</span></i></p>

Very entertaining, Grim.  Enjoyed it.  In the land of the low magic, the Viking Bersreker is king. <br><br>I foresee a new guild forming: the Guild of Norse Heroes.  My wheels are turning, once again....<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Sorry to bump my own build, but I was bored the other day and looked at the Epic builds page for the first time in ages and found the Wrathful Berserker.<br><br>It looks like my guy. Let me tell you the differences, it is somewhat relevant. Negative numbers means the Wrathful is better, positive numbers means the Viking is better.<br><br>AB: -1<br>Hp: +92<br>DR: +6<br>dmg: -4 and only 1d8 compared to 1d12. (average -6)<br>Saves<br>Fort: +4<br>Ref: -1<br>Will : 0<br><br>My guy has 1 ab lower, and less damage, but uses a shield, and has better longevity, plus better fort save. I have no idea why i didn't do Barbarian28/fighter4/CoT8. Except for the rp theme perhaps. His saves would improve and you would lose nothing. Saves with CoT taken instead of fighter for fighter lvl's 5-12 would look like this.<br><br>Fort 36<br>Ref 23<br>Will 22. At least better.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 01/29/06 18:11</span></i></p>
