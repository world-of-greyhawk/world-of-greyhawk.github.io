Casting, Slashing and Roaming Everywhere Dragon-kin are permitted (1-40) PvM and PvP<br><br>THE ARCANE KNIGHT (Angel of Vengeance)<br>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar<br><br>This build, the Arcane Knight (Angel of Vengeance) has come down to Earth as the result of a comment about spell swords, which implied they “suffer” as a result of being far too comprised b/w arcane and combat; in other words, some believe that most “do some of two things, but neither really, really well.” This knight does not agree, and is here to show that spell sword are not only versatile and fun, but that they also make for a strong bastion of destruction. Behold: <br><br>Natural AB 42 (buffed: 68), Devastating Critical (DC): 44 (buffed: 50), ample access to ninth level sorcerer spells, over 1700 effective HPs (has epic warding) –AND- is NOT dispellable. <br><br>The Arcane Knight combines the undeniable – and undispellable -- casting power of a 26th level sorcerer, with the combat prowess of a fighter and incredibly stylish wings of the prestige RDD class, in order to create the “ultimate” spell sword. While this is not the first of its kind in terms of the class combo chosen, nor is it the first to enjoy the power of dev.crit: it differs from all seven (7) others in terms not only of the level split, i.e., this one being the first to be undispellable, and it is also a high-power/PvP version, as the above numbers show. That said, with ample spell access (thus versatility), the Arcane knight is also most enjoyable PvM.<br><br>Strengths <br>•	Very good, highly buffable AB with Serious Damage potential, including Dev.Crit DC 44 (buffable to 50) and, at the same time, also Defense Oriented (incl., epic warding)<br>•	Can’t be Sneaked (True Seeing, Invis. Purge, See Invisibility, Ultravision, &amp; Darkness)<br>•	Undispellable buffs: an epic sorcerer having full access to ninth level spells, including a nice range of varying elemental damage, and a good Ice Storm (an area spell which is a pain to all enemies, but especially to arcane casters)<br>•	Highly Charismatic, Good-Looking Angel-Drake, with incredibly stylish red wings <br><br><br>Disadvantages<br>•	Has only 3 attacks/round unbuffed/unhasted (more fighter levels pre-epic would “cure” this, but would greatly detract from the build (and not worth it) since doing so would result in loss of sorcerer levels, which in turn would deny this knight his/her epic warding and render him/her vulnerable to dispelling); nor is such table necessary in any event, since it's “cured” by haste (grants 4th attack), with full enjoyment also of other spells, like Bigby’s-line and Time Stop;<br>•	Low spell DCs/No Foci: then again, this is a spell sword, with ample buffing power, and including saving throws (which saves, especially reflex, could otherwise be a problem)<br>•	Most Likely Barred from low-medium magic worlds (accordingly, a non-dev crit version follows in the next post for those wanting an Arcane Knight w/o dev.crit)<br><br><br>The Arcane Knight (Angel of Vengeance)<br>Sorcerer(26), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Fighter(4)<br>Race: Human <br>Alignment: Any (Theme: Any Lawful)<br><br><br>I.

Alternative Version- (No Dev.Crit)<br>In this suggested alternate version, in lieu of dev. Crit, we enhance our defense instead, while gaining slightly quicker spell access (i.e., all in by 32nd level), and we do so without giving up our combat presence, by merely adjusting as follows:  <br><br>Start/End Stats:<br>STR: 16 (38)<br>DEX: 12<br>CON: 12 (14)<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 10 (12)<br>CHA: 16 (19)<br><br>Modified Level Guide (Suggested):<br>06: Red Dragon Disciple(1): great fortitude*<br>15: Sorcerer(3): called shot*<br>21: Sorcerer(7): ewf: scimitar or greatsword<br>24: Sorcerer(10): CHA+1, epic prowess, (CHA=19)<br>27: Sorcerer(13): great strength I, (STR=30)<br>30: Sorcerer(16): great strength II, (STR=32)<br>36: Sorcerer(22): STR+1, great strength IV –OR- auto still, (STR=36)<br>37: Sorcerer(23): epic spell: epic warding<br>38: Sorcerer(24)<br>39: Sorcerer(25): great strength V –OR- auto still*, (STR=37)<br>40: Sorcerer(26): STR+1, epic spell: epic mage armor, (STR=38)<br>•	Note: since we’re not focused on dev.crit, might want to consider trading two great strengths (-1 AB/Dam.) for a couple of auto stills, or even more AC via i.e. armor skin.<br><br>In other words, we start with 1 less STR. (but wind up with the same), and instead use those starting points to enhance Dex; we also pick up epic mage armor which, as adjusted, grants us +22 AC (+2 Dex, +20 EMA); it also gives us a slight boost to our reflex save, as follows: Fortitude/Will/Reflex: 27/22/17 (+ above listed buffs)<br><br>Everything else remains the same. Drake on, and enjoy ~ Tyr <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 10/16/06 09:07</span></i></p>

At the dev.crit. version:<br><br>Just a thought, if you can live with AB+40, and the not so dragonlike Str 34...<br><br>Take Cha at lvl 28 so you have access to lvl 9 spells as soon as possible. Drop G.str I-III and take Autostill I-III at lvl 33, 36 and 39. Take Hellball or Greater ruin at lvl 40.<br><br>What you get is a more flexible caster. You can start using lvl 9 spells when you have 18 sorc lvls. <br>And with auto still you can cast in armor without stilling the spells. That opens up for using your other meta magic feats. <br>Another epic spell increases the punch and flexibility. In a low magic world, perhaps epic mage armor is an option.<br><br>Just a thought anyway...<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan

Why do you delay 9 and 10 until 19 and 20?  Wouldn't it be better for playability to get them earlier?

I would say pushing Sorceror to later is good as well for those of us in mods where we can't maximize hitpoints.   It means rather than getting 4 full HP you get 10 full HP (though honestly, on average you would get like 7.5 HP a level anyway from fighter, at lower levels, every one counts, in my experience)

I usually don't take lore either, so many things boost and improve it, and in singleplayer you can identify things with the game paused so the Lore spell's (or potion's) short duration doesn't matter.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Get yer bang instead on dem no-saves like the bigby’s line, ice, igms, etc., I agree -- but that AB/dev crit dc is nice, no?  (thanks!) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">          <br><br>Mick: what, drop strength to that of a paltry human? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">           Seriously, for sure, on the non-dev crit version, by all means you can pick up the stills and get those 9th level ones earlier if you want: good thinking (thanks!). As to the dev. crit version, well, you could, keeping in mind, if you were to drop 4 strengths on that one, not just your str (AB/damage) but also your dev crit (buffed) dc would drop to...um...*only* 48 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">     (ah, but it'd be such a shame not to enjoy the whole 50, don’t ya think <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">     <br><br>Epic spells – nice! and yes, greater ruin is good - 35d3 (i.e. 105) damage guaranteed (dbl if your target should happen to fail their save); also really nice about gtr. ruin is that, even although we’ve enough levels not to really worry about beating the standard toolset, that gtr ruin nevertheless ignores SR, which is such a really nice bonus (good thinking, and def. a great alternative to consider if you don’t want/need EMA for sure–thanks!) <br><br>Kail, Xylo: yeah, believe it or not, Ftrs get lore (thanks, GD) but not taunt, go figure; unfortunately, it’s an RDD requirement (such a shame, I agree; then, only 8 of ‘em (but when you think about it, sorcerers have identify, so of course this makes sense ... NOT    (yeah, I know: no complaining since it could be worse, right? Like maybe points in parry <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">        <br><br>As to why the delay re: the final two RDD, this was to give everyone a choice between metamagics (i.e., as between empower or maximize – a lot of casters prefer maximize, but there’s also good reason for choosing empower; selecting maximize requires the ability to cast 3rd level spells, though, and hence the reason for the delay; it’s not a long one though, only two levels, and I kept playability in mind when timing everything; that said, if you aren’t interested in maximize, by all means feel feel free to skip the delay, thus quickening your drakening (great question, Ariel and Kail - thanks! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 10/19/06 06:50</span></i></p>
