Could someone explain to me exactly how critical hits work.. I just had a discussion on teamspeak where we argued over three different ways we thought it was.. how I think it works:<br><br>You roll your 1d20 for AB and if it's within the threat range you roll another 1d20 for the threat range, if it's within the threat range again you get a crit.<br><br>-DaMouse

This means that you roll again 1d20+AB vs AC and if you hit (doesn't have to be within threat range this time) then you "confirm" the crit and deal crit damage.<br><br>Keep present that to confirm the crit you need to actually hit the AC on the second roll (1d20+AB&gt;=AC) without the 20=automatic hit, so very high AC foes might be practically immune to crit (since you can never confirm the crit)<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

If your AC is 21+ greater than his total AB, then he cannot crit you (this has been tested). Were there any conditions present that may have negated some of your AC?

Yeah, I always thought that a double 20 was a crit, so I whipped up a test in the tool-set.  Calculations said I should score a double 20 every four minutes or so.  Got two in three and a half minutes.  Must be lucky today.<br><br>Made a prostitute with 10,000hp and 100+ac.  Then made a dual kama ranger/monk to beat on her.  Should have named him "A Pimp Named Slickback".  [Boondocks rules!]<br><br>Here's the double 20s from the chat log.  No crits.  And empirical proof that I can be wrong.  I'm as shocked as anyone.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  <br><br>[CHAT WINDOW TEXT] [Sat Feb 04 15:18:58] Off Hand : Flurry of Blows : AAA Wensbanner attacks Prostitute : *hit* : (20 + 12 = 32 : Threat Roll: 20 + 12 = 32)<br>[CHAT WINDOW TEXT] [Sat Feb 04 15:18:58] AAA Wensbanner damages Prostitute: 5 (5 Physical)<br><br>[CHAT WINDOW TEXT] [Sat Feb 04 15:19:22] Flurry of Blows : AAA Wensbanner attacks Prostitute : *hit* : (20 + 19 = 39 : Threat Roll: 20 + 19 = 39)<br>[CHAT WINDOW TEXT] [Sat Feb 04 15:19:22] AAA Wensbanner damages Prostitute: 6 (6 Physical)<br><br>Interesting footnote: on the first try I apparently set her AC so high it wrapped around or something.
