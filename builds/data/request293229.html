Okay someone told me I shouldn't post this and I don't really know why.<br><br>I don't play NWN often, don't know much about builds and stuff, and that's why I'm on here looking for some help.<br><br>I just want a build that is good with duel scimitars.  I like thinking of a Prince of Persia build with a guy fighting with two scimitars, so I thought posting it on here would be of some help.<br><br>I don't have much time to check for similar builds that's why I'm posting this.<br><br>If you could provide me with some links that would be great.  Thank you and much appreciated.<br><br>oh and<br><br>Human or Half Elf please<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By nuame on 03/05/08 05:43</span></i></p>

There are many ways to build a dual wielder. But there are a couple of things you will need:<br><br>You will need to take the feats: Ambidexterity, Two Weapon Fighting and Improved Two Weapon Fighting to get the most out of your dual wielder.<br>You will need a dexterity of 15 to be able to take Ambidexterity.<br><br>Other than that you will need a high strenght to improve your AB and damage dealing. Start at 16 and pick strenght as you level up. (Scimitars are not finessable weapons, so dexterity based builds are out of the question.)<br><br>Scimitars are medium weapons. Dualwielding with a medium weapon offhand gives at best an AB penalty of -4 for both hand's attacks. (with a small weapon offhand the penalty would only have been -2). To compensate for this and be able to hit effectively you should collect as much AB as you can: <br>That means you should take most levels in a fighter type class pre epic. Any class that has full AB progression will do here.<br>Your AB will also benefit from a high strength.<br>Taking the Weapon Wocus feat and later on the Epic Weapon Focus and Epic Prowess feats will give a total boost of +4 to your AB.<br><br>If you still have problems hitting the enemy you can always make a build with many lvls of Weapon Master. The Superior Weapon Focus and Epic Superior Weapon Focus class feats will improve your AB (up to a max of +7).<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...
