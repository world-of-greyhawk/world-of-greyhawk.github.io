Okay, in my server it is possible to get every type of stat upgraded to max. I was wondering what build would make that good. I was think at least one monk for awesome ac bonus with max dex and wis, but thats all I have.

Anything in particular you want to play? Caster? Tank? I'm about to look at some of my old tank builds, coincidentally. For tanks how about Bard/RDD/CoT, Bard/PM/DwD, Bard/Fighter/PM, or Rogue/Fighter/WM.

What a bummer!  This isnt a server!  Max stats!!  What does this mean?  Get to 50 in each?  OR get to +12 in each from itms?  There is a HUGE difference in what you said and what you actually meant to say, if i am sober enough to read the post correctly!<br><br>Why im bummed is that I thought this was gonna be a nother newbie post that asked for the most ultimate build!   btw, bioware screwed up the original game so much that the ultimate build is only possible with PRC!  LOL  Another PRC plug.   Ill post it one day, but it IS the ONLY build that can be considered the ULTIMATE!!!!<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

I honestly dont believe you were sober enough to answer that question...<br><br>But as avado still said: does it mean you can get items with +12 ability enchantments, or does it mean that you can get all abilities to 50? (that would mean serious hak-packs)<br><br>In any case, if enchantments: Any class would be good with extreme main ability. A dex based monk with +12 dex, wis and str gets Enormous AC, high AB and even good damage. (Dex based often lack the latter). However, you will face evil RDD fighter-critters with ridiculous strength and dev-crit DC, or assassins with death attacks that stun you by just giving you a mean look.<br>And socerers with 7-8 bigbys or 20 IGMS. <br><br>You have to find out what you want to do, and get the stuff thats best for that build. Specialise or make a multi-tasker build. It has been said many times: There is NO ultimate build, its how you play it, not what you play that matters.

The build you play does matter quite a bit... but sure, how you play is just as important.<br><br>There is no ultimate build, that's nothing new, and if it were, your enemies would also be using it, so don't expect to be able to make a build that can win against anything.<br><br>In general terms, arcane casters are the safest bet for PvP, but they aren't ultimate either.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Well I can get all my stats to 60 and you do this by buying them from the DMs. I only named it "Ultimate" Build just because it gets pretty Uber. A lot of spell casters have been doing quite well so I might do something like that. But I kinda suck at playing one of those. Would a Shifter/Druid/Monk work?

I'm assuming RDD is near worthless as you are going to increase the stats to 60 anyway.  I might actually try a pure (or near pure) monk for this. Boost the SR so high you don't have to worry about spells.  Go halfling or gnome just to avoid Evards.  Your AC will be 10 base + 15 dex + 15 wis + 8 tumble + items.  Monk 39/Rogue 1 can grant a very high UMD.
