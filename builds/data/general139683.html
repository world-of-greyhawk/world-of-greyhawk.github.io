Hey.  I'm new to the guild.  I have been looking for an excellent Arcane Archer build and I have come across one possible one that would be really excellent when Devastating Critical for the longbow works in the new patch.<br><br>The problem I see is that the build does not seem to work for me.  I've been trying to build it.  The build can be found here:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117554", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>The problem I am encountering is at AA (14).  The build says to go for Great Strength II and Overwhelming Crit (longbow).  Only problem, there is no overwhelming crit (longbow) in the list of available feats.<br><br>Is this supposed to be like that?  Like, is this a good build for later when the patch comes out?  If that's the case, then I'm an idiot.  But I'm stuck.<br><br>Thanks!<br>_________________<br>"Thank God for your strength..."

It doesn't, in fact it has 328 HP, which is significantly lower.  Just wondering if I messed up somewhere, but I don't think I did.<br>_________________<br>"Thank God for your strength..."
