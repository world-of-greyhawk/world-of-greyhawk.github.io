Just in case anyone is still playing NWN1, here's a dualwielding hero for the working day.  High AB, lethal damage delivery system, solid hit points, and not only ges WM prereq feats, but also gets dualwielding, IKD, and the other necessary combat feats to maintain survivability.  While the number of Ftr/Bard/WMs are legion, this combination somehow came up unique.<br><br><br><b>Lord of the Fray</b><br><br>Class:  Fighter14/Bard4/WeaponMaster22<br>Race: Dwarf<br>Alignment: Non-lawful<br>Playable: 1-40, PvM<br><br><b>Attributes</b><br>Str16 (32)<br>Int14<br>Wis8<br>Dex15<br>Con16<br>Chr6<br><br><b>Level Guide</b><br><br>1 Fighter1, Dodge, Mobility<br>2 Fighter2, Knockdown<br>3 Fighter3, Weapon Focus: Handaxes<br>4 Fighter4, Weapon Specialization: Handaxes, Str17<br>5 Fighter5<br>6 Fighter6, Ambidexterity, TWF<br>7 Fighter7<br>8 Fighter8, Blindfighting, Str18<br>9 Fighter9, ITWF<br>10 Fighter10, Spring Attack<br>11 Fighter11<br>12 Fighter12, Whirlwind Attack, Expertise, Str19<br>13 WM1<br>14 WM2<br>15 WM3, Improved Critical<br>16 WM4, Str20<br>17 WM5<br>18 WM6, Improved Knockdown<br>19 WM7<br>20 WM8, Str21<br>21 WM9, Great Str I <br>22 Bard1 <br>23 WM10<br>24 WM11, Great Str II, Str24<br>25 WM12<br>26 WM13, EWF: Handaxes<br>27 Bard2, Great Str III<br>28 Fighter13, Str26<br>29 Fighter14, EWS: Handaxes<br>30 WM14, Great Str IV<br>31 WM15<br>32 Bard3, Str 28<br>33 WM16, Armor Skin, Great Str V<br>34 WM17<br>35 WM18<br>36 WM19, Great Str VI, Epic Prowess, Str31<br>37 Bard4<br>38 WM20<br>39 WM21, Toughness<br>40 WM22, Epic Toughness, Str32.<br><br><b>Combat Vitals</b><br>AB: 50/45/40/35<br>Dualwielding: 48/43/38/33/48/43<br>Mainhand: 1d6+17 (17-20/x4)<br>Offhand: 1d6+17 (17-20/x4)<br>AC: 29 (32 w/Tower Shield)<br>HP: 564<br><br><b>Skills:</b> 180<br>Discipline: 43 (54)<br>Tumble: 40<br>UMD: 37 (35)<br>Intimidate: 4<br>Spellcraft: 38 (40) <br>Perform: 11<br>Heal: 3<br><br><b>Saves</b><br>Fort: 26 (36)<br>Will: 19 (29)<br>Reflex: 22 (32)<br>________________________<br><br>Alternatives: Take Rogue instead of Bard.

I'd easily sacrifice 1 BAB for earlier UMD. That apart, the build is quite good and balanced... not that one can expect otherwise from the Dwarflord.<br><br>NWN1 twilight has begun, few are left in the ECB guild halls.

My head emptied of build-ideas long ago. But I still roam these halls just as often.<br><br>About the build, I have to agree with Kail here. People get to stuck on maximising their BAB so they forget nice playability features. like taking a bard level at say 12 for obvious reasons. Pretty sure you'd ease levelling by doing it.<br><br>But as usual Grizz delivers. I once played a dual-wielding weaponmaster, and it's fun.

Nice build, dualwield and WM are such large feat investments they rarely seem to meet.<br><br>Normally I am bullish on saving throws, as has been noted, but if I were making a fighter/WM type character such as this, I'd probably plan from the beginning on using gear to cover my saves instead.  So for this build I'd likely be a fan of rogue... the +8 vs spells is nice but I'd be wanting immunity and saves gear for all the non-spell attacks anyway.<br><br>In that same vein I'd echo the call for trading 1 AB for earlier UMD... being able to use scrolls (mind blank, shadow shield, even protection from alignment) before the epic levels will benefit you a lot under many circumstances in a low-saves build.<br><br>I still browse these forums but rarely post now... low on build inspiration that isn't just updating and retreading ground I or others have already trodden.  I'm not even playing NWN2, sort of in a PC-game limbo <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"><br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Xylophone on 11/30/06 02:00</span></i></p>

I would have to agree with the 2Bard pre-epic.  My initial goal was to achieve as high as AB as possible, which meant sucking it up and grunting it out pre-epic.  In retrospect, I realize that taking 2 Bard will grant +3 to Will and Reflex save over just the +1 to Reflex granted by 2 more WM levels.  That alone provides a compelling argument.<br><br>Also glad to see all my favorite builders are still here with me.  Hail to you, my brothers!<br><br>P.S.

That you can do since it doesn't even changes any feat at all, weapons are always chosen by the user, only a few non-monk builds state a weapon that can't be swapped.
