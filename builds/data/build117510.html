Here's a "less conventional" character build.<br><br>She doesn't immediately focus on melee damage, and is geared more towards spellcasting. The idea was to make a Cleric/Arcane Archer character, but as it came out, of course she's not using her bow that much. Still, it's nice...<br><br>Frail<br><br>Elf, Rebel<br>Age: 290<br>Cleric (26), Wizard (1), Arcane Archer (13)<br>Domains: Magic, Trickery<br>School of Magic: General<br>Experience: 898900<br><br>Abilities<br><br>Strength: 14 (+2)<br>Dexterity: 10 (0)<br>Constitution: 12 (1)<br>Intelligence: 14 (2)<br>Wisdom: 30 (10)<br>Charisma: 11 (0)<br><br>Natural AC: 10<br>Hitpoints: 268<br><br>Fortitude: 23<br>Reflex: 20<br>Will: 32<br>Base attack: 25<br><br>Attack bonus with shortbow, base: +42/+37/+32<br>Attack bonus with shortbow, under Divine Power: +50/+45/+40<br>Attack bonus with rapier: +27/+22/+17<br>Attack bonus with rapier, under Divine Power: +37/+32/+27<br><br>Skills<br><br>Appraise: 7<br>Bluff: 0<br>Concentration: 31<br>Craft skills: 2 each (int modifier)<br>Disable Trap: 7*<br>Discipline: 2 (strength modifier)<br>Heal: 26<br>Hide: 30*<br>Intimidate: 0<br>Listen: 12<br>Lore: 12<br>Move Silently: 30*<br>Open Lock: 5*<br>Parry: 10<br>Persuade: 10*<br>Search: 9*<br>Spellcraft: 34<br>Spot: 12<br>Taunt: 0<br><br>*special: +13 for each "rogue" skill while Divine Trickery is engaged (5 turns + charisma modifier)<br><br>Feats<br><br>All armour proficiencies, shield proficiency<br>Arrow of Death<br>Combat Casting<br>Enchant Arrow VI<br>Epic Cleric<br>Epic Arcane Archer<br>Epic Reflexes<br>Epic Skill Focus: Spellcraft<br>Extend Spell<br>Extra Turning<br>Great Wisdom IV<br>Hail of Arrows<br>Hardiness vs. Enchantments<br>Imbue Arrow<br>Immunity to Sleep<br>Improved Combat Casting<br>Improved Critical (Katana)<br>Keen Sense<br>Low-light Vision<br>Magic Domain Powers (access to spells: Mage Armour, Melf's Acid Arrow, Negative Energy Burst, Stoneskin, Ice Storm)<br>Maximise Spell<br>Point-blank Shot<br>Scribe Scroll<br>Seeker Arrow II<br>Skill affinity: Listen, Search, Spot (+2 for each)<br>Summon Familiar<br>Trickery Domain Powers (access to spells: Invisibility, Invisibility Sphere, Improved Invisibility, and a skill bonus of 1 for each two levels, for Disable Trap, Search, Hide, Move Silently, Open Lock &amp; Pick Pockets)<br>Turn Undead<br>Weapon Proficiencies: all<br>Zen Archery<br><br>Notice that she has high Hide &amp; Move Silently skills, so she can sneak around in stealth mode and full plate. At least it works in singleplayer<br><br>The DC for her spell saves are high, a Destruction cast by Frail can kill an Ancient Black Dragon. A dracolich can't resist her Heal.<br><br>So, in summary: fairly stealthy, capable of casting Stoneskin &amp; Improved Invis, capable of disabling most traps and opening most locks on her own, capable of casting Wizard spells from scrolls and using wizardly gear, a fairly powerful Cleric, and an Arcane Archer.<br>_________________<br>Elven Cleric and a devout Deekinist.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 02:30</span></i></p>
