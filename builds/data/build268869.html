This is the new and improved Mini-Monk based on suggestions from many wise builders that lurk these threads. They tore him apart, and made him a new character.

I noticed in the last thread that you have miss understood crippling strike. What it does is lower the targets str by 2 permanently on each sneak attack.

Oh yes, lesser restoration or something of that nature will fix it.

Crippling Strike lowers opponent Str by 2 each time you land a sneak attack. It is devastating to Str-builds - their AB drop rapidly, and they often get burdened as well. It is an excellent feat for a sneak attack build. With your up to 7 attacks per round that means you could lower their Str by 14 in a single round (giving them -7 to AB and you effectively +7 to AC).<br><br>TM

Yeah, many Fighters have 600+ HP, and more with CON gear but how many 15d6's can they handle? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  I guess there's potions of Heal and stuff, but not in 1v1 PvP that is only for the sake of PvP, in my experience.

Depends on the build. A DwD with 30/DR can handle quite a few sneak attacks, since even at 15d6 only an average of 20-30 will get through, and they tend to have 800+ HP. <br><br>And for this build, with only 5d6 sneaks, it will be even more valuable. 5d6 is only an average 17.5 extra points of damage, less than the str bonus + EWS on most str-builds. He can expect to have to go a few rounds, so dropping that AB will be quite useful.<br><br>TM
