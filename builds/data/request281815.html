I'm looking for a pure PvM build on my extremely-hard-to-solo-on PW, for soloing <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  heh<br><br>Here are some details:<br><br>-+5 world, but +5's are pretty tough to get.<br>-Resting is limited, the time between rests scales up with levels(Like a level 1 can rest every 2 hours, a level 20 can only rest every 9 hours, etc.. unless you go to an inn)<br>-in epic levels, there are a decent amount of either magic or physical immune monsters<br>-Death magic and getting your buffs dispelled by MD is a problem(in epic levels)<br><br>-Dev crit is disabled<br>-Harm/heal(when damaging) does 50% of the targets health, and most of the important stuff is just completely immune to it.<br>-Implosion does not insta kill, it only does 50% of monsters life just like harm<br>-Undeaths eternal foe doesn't give AC<br>-Bigbys spells have a reflex save<br>-IGMS is nerfed(calculates number of missles based on your level)<br>-Dragonshape is nerfed.. it doesn't say how though..<br>-Black Blade of Disaster is changed a lot. It isn't invulnerable, but it's damage and HP is increased. It also scales with your caster level and your INT/CHA. And you can cast spells with it out.<br>-Greater Sanctuary duration is nerfed, and you can only cast it once every 10 minutes.<br>-Can't shift your alignment.<br><br>I probably missed something, but that's most of the big stuff. Any suggestions?

No dev crit? You might want to try a scythe build then.  Human Bard/RDD/WM will give it a good crit range and plenty of damage.  You might even be able to UMD some keen scrolls to cast keen on your scythe.  No martial weapons though.

A paladin type should do fine in that environment. I would have tried my <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "217140", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Guardian of Light</a>.<br><br>If a holy crusader isn't your thing, try any cleric build for melee or sorc for caster, using black blade or tenser against creatures immune to spells.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

Something like Paladin/CoT/Rogue, Cha-based. Divine Wrath and Divine Might can be combined to give you some impressive amounts of divine damage per hit. If items with Holy Avenger on them are available, I would go heavy on the CoT - basically just enough Paladin to qualify for CoT, then CoT with occasional Rogue skill dumps. If HA is not available, then take 20 Paladin so you can cast it a few times, 15-16 CoT, and a few Rogue tumble dumps. <br><br>Great Smite is optional - nice if you want it, but not critical since you are focusing more on the divine damage. If the bosses have high DR, great smite can break through it, but if they actually have 100% immunity to slashing, piercing, etc., then it won't. <br><br>TM
