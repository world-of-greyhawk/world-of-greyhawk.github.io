Hey all, this is my first build I post here, I couldn't find any builds with the exact same level spread, however I did find some similar builds, namely <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "246874", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>BloodAxe the DEXtrous</a> by Grimnir77, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "203030", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Halfling Mousquetaire</a> by lendorallen, and <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "208249", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Raucous Raider</a> by Mithdradates. The main difference with my build is that she is an elven dex-based bard heavy (lasting inspiration) epic dodger, whereas the others might be dex-based (except one) but they haven't gone for Lasting Inspiration. Anyways I hereby present the build =)<br><br>Dashing Bladesinger - Rogue 16 / Fighter 4 / Bard 20<br>Elf - Chaotic Neutral<br><b><i>Playable PvM 1-40, be advised; Heavy XP penalty</i></b><br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 18 -&gt; 26<br>CON: 12 -&gt; 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 14 -&gt; 16<br><br>LEVELING GUIDE<br>01: &lt;Rogue&gt;(1): Knockdown<br>02: &lt;Fighter&gt;(1): Weapon Finesse<br>03: &lt;Rogue&gt;(2): Toughness<br>04: &lt;Fighter&gt;(2): Blindfight, Dex(19)<br>05: &lt;Fighter&gt;(3):<br>06: &lt;Fighter&gt;(4): WF:Rapier, WS:Rapier *<br>07: &lt;Bard&gt;(1): <br>08: &lt;Bard&gt;(2): Dex(20)<br>09: &lt;Bard&gt;(3): Improved Knockdown<br>10: &lt;Rogue&gt;(3): **<br>11: &lt;Rogue&gt;(4): <br>12: &lt;Bard&gt;(4): Extend Spell, Dex(21)<br>13: &lt;Rogue&gt;(5): <br>14: &lt;Bard&gt;(5): <br>15: &lt;Bard&gt;(6): Curse Song *<br>16: &lt;Rogue&gt;(6): Dex(22)<br>17: &lt;Bard&gt;(7): <br>18: &lt;Rogue&gt;(7): Improved Critical:Rapier<br>19: &lt;Rogue&gt;(8): <br>20: &lt;Bard&gt;(8): Dex(23)<br>21: &lt;Rogue&gt;(9): EWF:Rapier<br>22: &lt;Bard&gt;(9): <br>23: &lt;Rogue&gt;(10): (Rogue: Improved Evasion)<br>24: &lt;Bard&gt;(10): Armor Skin, Dex(24)<br>25: &lt;Rogue&gt;(11): <br>26: &lt;Bard&gt;(11): <br>27: &lt;Rogue&gt;(12): Great CHA I (Cha(15))<br>28: &lt;Bard&gt;(12): Dex(25)<br>29: &lt;Bard&gt;(13): <br>30: &lt;Rogue&gt;(13): (Rogue: Defensive Roll), <b>Epic Dodge</b><br>31: &lt;Rogue&gt;(14): <br>32: &lt;Bard&gt;(14): Cha(16)<br>33: &lt;Rogue&gt;(15): Epic Prowess<br>34: &lt;Bard&gt;(15): <br>35: &lt;Bard&gt;(16): <br>36: &lt;Bard&gt;(17): Great Con I (Con(13)), Dex(26)<br>37: &lt;Bard&gt;(18): <br>38: &lt;Bard&gt;(19): <br>39: &lt;Bard&gt;(20): <b>Lasting Inspiration</b><br>40: &lt;Rogue&gt;(16): (Rogue: Crippling Strike), Con(14)<br><br>Hitpoints: 376 (616 with full con buff, and +28 from bard song = 644)<br><br>Skillpoints: 326<br><br>Saving Throws F/R/W (Spellcraft): 20/31/18 (28/39/26)<br>Saving Throws Buffed F/R/W (Spellcraft): (Bard Song, +12 Dex/Con)<br><br>BAB: 26 (16 pre-epic)<br>AB: 38/33/28/23<br>AB Buffed: (+53)53/48/43/38 (+6 full dex, +5 GMS +2 war cry +2 bard song and add the other attack from haste)<br><br>AC naked: 28 (10 base, +8 dex, +8 tumble, +2 Armor Skin)<br>AC buffed: 47 (+6 full dex, +4 Mage Armor, +4 haste)<br><br>-Curse Song Note- You'd actually get +5 to AB and +2 AC (applied negatively to opponent) when turning this on.<br><br>Damage unbuffed: 1d6 + 2 (WS), though can deliver +8d6 from sneaks<br>Damage buffed: 1d6 + 18 (+6 full Str, +5 GMS, +2 War Cry, +3 Bard Song) +8d6 through sneaks.<br><br><br>SKILLS<br>Discipline: 42 (Could be swapped for concentration)<br>Hide: 43<br>Listen: 43<br>Move Silently: 43<br>Perform: 42<br>Spellcraft: 42<br>Tumble: 40<br>UMD: 31 <br>No leftover skillpoints <br><br>Advantages: <br>High AC combined with Epic Dodge and 50% concealmeant bonus (dispellable).<br>Decent AB - With a fully buffed dex and the use of Bard song, Curse Song and your buffs you more than make up for the low naked AB.<br>Very high Hide/MS with Bard Song activated; perfect for delivering sneaks combined with Darkness or IKD.<br>Very high Listen: You'll be able to spot a lot of Hide/MS users with a listen score of 42 + 20 (amplify) + 7 Bard song + 2 elf = 71!

I like it.  Just a couple things I might switch up:<br><br>-Improved Critical is pretty much worthless to you.  Sneak damage doesn't get multiplied, so all you're multiplying by 2 is your 1d6+2 base damage.  Hardly worth it.  If your weapon is going to have a lot of +damage on it, maybe it's worth taking, but in most settings, probably not.  I'd switch it out for something, maybe Iron Will to shore up that weak save a little.<br><br>-Sneak Attack is just asking for dual-wielding.  With ITWF, you can get 7 attacks in a round, meaning when you break stealth to attack someone, you get 3 sneak attacks instantly.  Ideally, that's 24d6 sneak damage and 6 str damage.  I'd drop WS, Improved Crit, and Extend Spell for Ambidex, TWF, and ITWF, then switch your WFs to Handaxe or Shortsword.  In this case, I'd probably also switch the two stat points you've put into Con back into Dex, to help counteract the AB penalty from dual wielding.  This one isn't so much a way to make the build better as a variant that I think is also viable.<br><br>-----<br><br>Finally, one thing I gotta say:  Nice formatting!  People's first posted build is usually a complete mess, missing information required by the stickies, and requiring a mod or some helpful member to come in and tell them what needs fixing.  This is concise, well-documented, easy to read, and displays a good understanding of the build's true strengths and weaknesses.  Good job, and welcome to the guild!<br><br>*edit* Oh, that's why you know how to format, 'cause you've been here for four years, you just haven't posted a build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  .<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Nimueh_Leafbow on 04/10/07 03:30</span></i></p>

I was thinking this one over, but I'm not sure it fits the Roleplay aspect, I'm pretty sure the bladesinger PrC in 3.5 is single-weapon wielding. If not then this would definately make the build more powerful (indeed the three feats you mentioned, aren't really essential).<br>As I also mentioned, one could always drop the +2 con for +2 dex, it would definately be helpful to a dual-wielder.<br><br>And lastly; Heh thanks, though I've not been in the guild for that long, I'm not sure why it says that... Maybe it's the time the account was created. I just take pride in reading guidelines before posting, as should anyone if you ask me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">     <br>Again, thanks for the welcome.<br><br>PS about the formatting, for some reason I can't seems to make a series of quotes, I'll look into that, but that would explain my numerous edits (in this post) heh.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By CaZin0 on 04/10/07 11:06</span></i></p>
