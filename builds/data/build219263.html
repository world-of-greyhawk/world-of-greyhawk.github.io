Ranger+rogue is a classic combination but strangely enough I haven't seen this class combo coupled with HS. <br>Here's my go at it.

I just came to know that epic dodge prerequisites are bugged and therefore neither the dodge feat neither the 30 ranks in tumble are required. This means you can get ED at 24th lvl in this build by taking the 13th rogue lvl on 24th lvl (and getting defensive roll and epic dodge at the same time), moving up HS 4th and 5th lvl and getting the last Great Dex at 27th lvl (since instead og Great Dex at 24th lvl one takes ED in this case)<br>Also, instead of dodge I'd take toughness for 40 more HP (therefore hitting the 400 HP mark).<br>Man, I've got to find the proper offerings for the Edit Gods now.... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 11/06/05 10:45</span></i></p>

Not sure what ranger brings into this build. The few spells? rp-reasons? I think fighter would have been better. You can still dual wield, and even get EWS to help deal with damage on non-sneakable opponents. Even CoT would be a feasible class, you can easily manage 8 levels pre-epic. You would need to shuffle huffle feats, because dual wielding is not CoT bonus feats.<br><br>Quite nice build, though.

Well I think ranger brings a few things to a build like this - one half of the ultravision/darkness combo for making sneak attacks, some movement impeding spells, chance to buff with cat's grace as both normal spell and harper ability, etc.<br><br>It's not absolutely the optimal no-brainer choice but it does have a few things going for it regardless.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

But Rg 25/FTR 10/HS 5 have already been done by both Cinn and the Dwarflord (both dexxers of course), there was no point going that route again. Excellent builds, btw. I would probably pick their builds over mine too.<br>Ranger brings free dual wield from the start, more skill points, an animal companion to help generate sneaks, Cat's grace stakable with the harper spell/potion, animal empaty, stealth advantages outdoor...and from a RP point of view a better scout flavour, so to say.<br>In PnP it would probably be a better build also... but that's another world altogether <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Thanks all for the feedback<br>Cheers, <br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò
