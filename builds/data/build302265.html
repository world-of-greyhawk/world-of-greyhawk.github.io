Another pure build?  I know the +4AC in epic is nice, but are you just going to continue this through each prestige class? I have the feeling the next one posted is a sorcerer/RDD, then a bard/palemaster and wizard/palemaster. (Please skip sorcerer 10/palemaster 30 they can't take a sorcerer level high enough to be able select level 9 spells.)

Well then, what's the point to this one?  Seems an absolutely awful build in my eyes, and I can't see any reason to do it other than the (rather bizarre) desire to make a thirty level RDD build.  Why bother at all?  If you're going to do this, why not do a sorc10/PM30?  How is that different?  You can make the best 30 level PM sorc build possible.  Wowee zowee.<br><br>I'll admit I never really understood the desire for pure builds to begin with, but 'pure' prestige class builds seem even more ridiculous, especially when the results are god awful.  It's all just so incredibly artificial.

I know you all have had it drilled into you for years never to take more than 10 levels of RDD, but take an objective look at this build. It is not optimal, but it is not really all that awful.<br><br>With 36 STR and 41 mundane AB, he should have a decent melee presence for PvM. With 624 hit points, EDR III, and 35 mundane AC, he should be able to take a licking and keep on ticking. His saves are decent (minimum of 20), with +9 against spells.<br><br>The Bard Song and Curse Song is only level 8, but it is there.<br><br>Also, I would think this build would be easy to RP, fully embracing his inner dragon.<br>_________________<br>"Never laugh in the face of a live dragon." - Bilbo Baggins

It's not that it's completely unplayable, but 41 AB is crap for a regular RDD build, and very lousy for any melee build.

I think we should all give this man credit for continuing in a vein that is clearly against what the EPIC character build guild is designed for.  Lest we forget, this guild was designed for people who have a desire to build and share builds that were the best of the best!  Our leader has several on bioware's page!  This is what the guild IS!  or saddly, was.  <br><br>Empyre, i do respect your devotion to a dying thread.  Really, the Pure builds thread was designed for the base classes.  The reason you are finding these "vacancies" as you say is because there is no real concrete definition of a pure build.  You say pure rdd is 10bard/30rdd, why?  When you look at things, REALLY look at things, rdd isnt designed to take past 10.  Infact, when we look at nwn2, no prc is taken past 10.. does this suggest something?  only indirectly.  I am not using the nwn2 comment as concrete Evidence, only to help clarify.<br><br>Look at it this way, if rdd gets ALL the goods in 10 levels, taking more than 10 is a waste.  Bard, as has been edumicated to me over the last few weeks really tops at 30...  hmm.  This suggests to me that a PURE rdd is something like a bard30/rdd10 build.  Or, even for some synergistic virtuosity.. 10bard/10rdd/20sorc!!  OOOHH!!  me likes the sound of that one!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>The really hard part of these "pure" builds for me, a long standing memeber of the guild, is that they are only your rather weak presentations of builds.  If i was new to this guild, your relentless posting of weak builds would turn me off (it has already and i am addicted!!).  You have proven what ever little point you have made.
