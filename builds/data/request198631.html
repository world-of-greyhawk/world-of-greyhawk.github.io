One technical point.  You forgot to actually take Weapon Specialization at some point.  You have Epic Weapon Specialization, but no plain old Weapon Specialization.<br><br>Steve

Hmm .. I *know* I took it ... somewhere..but don't exactly remember when I did.  This aging thing ain't pretty! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Because I was able to get EWS on the last Fighter level.  Harumph.  So I must have forgot to list it when I was (hurridly) trying to post.<br><br>Thanks for the catch.  <br><br>Joe

You can take WS with the fighter bonus feat you get at lvl6 (ftr lvl4).<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

Why did you keep STr and DEX at 13?  14 each seems a better number.  You could drop your CHA down to 24 and have that +1 damage, +1 AC and +1 reflex saves.  And all the skills that have STR and DEX as their base would also get +1 to them.<br><br>Just a thought.

Yeah, I messed up on the sheet there -- believe I did take WS at that level and forgot to type it in when I was doing my character sheet.  <br><br>On the beginning stats one, I screwed up and thought there was one of my feats that needed DEX 13.  Since I apparently don't need a DEX that high, thought I would go with a beginning STR of 14 and a DEX then of 12.<br><br>Or I suppose if I go ambidex and go for the 2 weapon feats, I could make the DEX of 15 then.  But I'd have to gimp STR and lose a bit of CHA to do so...<br><br>(as well as eat up more feats too)<br><br>Joe

I would probably dump necromancy and get enchantment maybe instead so you can have some alternatives for fighting mobs of critters (and yes invisibility stays up by default when you cast dominate spells, just thought you'd like do know <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> ). Since the real things you want dead fast are gonna be melee and they will have a good fortitude save (well usually).
