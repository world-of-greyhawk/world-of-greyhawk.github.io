You get 7 general feats plus 2 HS bonus feats, that's 9 Great Dex. No base class gets Great Dex as a bonus feat, so I don't think you can get the 10th one. You would need some levels of AA or Assassin or something to do that, which would mean dropping either HS or WM.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Build Hope Fors;<br><br>1.

True, but not till level 24. With 20 WM levels and 5 HS, that only leaves 15.<br><br>TM

Thank you for the quick response and clarity in your answers.  One quick question though.  Why 13 levels of Fighter?  Why not 3 more levels of WM?

Oops, just came up with a reaon - EWS. You will be going Fighter 10/WM 10 pre-epic, you need to take at least 2 fighter levels in epic to pick up EWS (you are using all of your general feats for Great Dex, so you need a fighter bonus feat). In a dex-build, that will be important for damage output.<br><br>So, I go back to Fighter 12/WM23/HS 5 (the las WM level just gets you 1 more Ki Damage use per day).<br><br><br>Looks something like this:<br><br>Fighter(12), Weapon Master(23), Harper Scout(5), Elf<br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 20 (38)<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br>Hitpoints: 460<br>Skillpoints: 182<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/17/34<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +4, Traps: +2<br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 53 (melee), 45 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 34/37<br><br>01: F(1): Weapon Focus: Rapier, Weapon Finesse<br>02: F(2): Dodge<br>03: F(3): Mobility<br>04: F(4): DEX+1, Weapon Specialization: Rapier, (DEX=21)<br>05: F(5)<br>06: F(6): Spring Attack, Expertise<br>07: F(7)<br>08: F(8): DEX+1, Whirlwind Attack, (DEX=22)<br>09: WM(1): Improved Critical: Rapier, Weapon of Choice: Rapier<br>10: WM(2)<br>11: WM(3)<br>12: WM(4): DEX+1, Knockdown, (DEX=23)<br>13: WM(5)<br>14: WM(6)<br>15: WM(7): Alertness<br>16: WM(8): DEX+1, (DEX=24)<br>17: WM(9)<br>18: WM(10): Iron Will<br>19: F(9)<br>20: F(10): DEX+1, Improved Knockdown, (DEX=25)<br>21: HS(1): Epic Weapon Focus: Rapier, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=26)<br>22: HS(2)<br>23: HS(3)<br>24: HS(4): DEX+1, Great Dexterity II, (DEX=28)<br>25: F(11)<br>26: F(12): Epic Weapon Specialization: Rapier<br>27: WM(11): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=29)<br>28: WM(12): DEX+1, (DEX=30)<br>29: WM(13): Epic Prowess<br>30: WM(14): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=31)<br>31: WM(15)<br>32: WM(16): DEX+1, Armor Skin, (DEX=32)<br>33: WM(17): Great Dexterity V, (DEX=33)<br>34: WM(18)<br>35: WM(19): Epic Toughness I<br>36: WM(20): DEX+1, Great Dexterity VI, (DEX=35)<br>37: HS(5): Great Dexterity VII, (DEX=36)<br>38: WM(21)<br>39: WM(22): Great Dexterity VIII, Epic Toughness II, (DEX=37)<br>40: WM(23): DEX+1, (DEX=38)<br><br>Hitpoints: 460<br>Skillpoints: 182<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/17/34<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +4, Traps: +2<br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 53 (melee), 45 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 34/37<br><br><br>Note - this build has no Uncanny Dodge, and will be hurt badly if caught flat-footed. No sneak damage, and low str, so damage output will be low, even with the crits. Not much stealth, and not enough skillpoints left over to max both Hide and MS. So, while it meets your requirements, I don't think it is a very ideal build.<br><br>TM

Again, thank you for the timely responses.  This was just an idea that I was working on, I agree though that it is not a well rounded build.  But, it was more to see if I was missing something by not being able to hit that Great Dex 10.  Appreciate the build example and the candid comments, always helpful.

25/10/5 wm/fighter/hs, 28/10/2 wm/fighter/bard and 25/12/3 wm/fighter/rogue with epic weapon specilisation, are all battle tested and proven to be effective at BoW. of course they might be terrible wherever it is you play, but I'm speaking for me.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By D O'Brien123 on 04/18/06 11:33</span></i></p>

The question I always have when i see this type of thing is, why no epic dodge?  So, this idea has no uncanny, no epic dodge, no "other" ac increases, has ALL epic feats to gr dex, so will be lackin ewf and epic prowess (dont you need ewf for ews?).   IMHO, you are sacrificing way too much to get gr dex 10!  If you want gr dex 10 AND nice AB go AA.  In the end you will get much closer to what you are looking for.<br><br>Peace
