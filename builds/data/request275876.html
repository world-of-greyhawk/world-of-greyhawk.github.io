Im looking for a build that can reach the max spot and listen (127). My server can make items with +skill bonus for it and I can get up to 127 spot/listen. It doesn't really matter what build it is. I just want one that can reach the max spot and listen. Thanks! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Isn't that just any build with the max WIS possible, Skill Focus: Spot, Epic Skill Focus: Spot, Skill Focus: Listen and Epic Skill Focus Listen? like a Druid or a Cleric multiclassed with Champion of Torm and Monk, and that's it.

Well, if you can get the max skill boost from items (which is +50), then you need to have a raw 77 score. You can get 43 from skill point investment alone. Add in SF and ESF for another 13, which brings you to 56. So you're looking for 21 more points. Both Artist and Blooded give you a +2 bonus to Spot.<br><br>Elves, Gnomes, and Halflings get a +2 racial bonus to Listen, so one of those races and one of the above mentioned feats will mean you need to scrounge up 19 more points somewhere. That's a 48 WIS score. Looks like CLC or Druid (as Thax said) starting with maxed WIS, boosting it as high as it can go, and maxing out your WIS with items/spells.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
