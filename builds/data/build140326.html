Strength +1<br><br>** In servers that don't allow Devastating Critical, use Called Shot, instead.<br><br>Overview<br>The knight is a soldier of valor, honor &amp; chivalry and a master swordsman who wield a blade like no other. Knights come from all classes, from lower class to upperclass, but all of them have the same goal in mind, which is to serve one's country and it's king and protect the weak. The knight night trains day and knight to become best the warrior their is.<br><br>Fencing<br>The knight is excellent in disarming (Disarm, Improve Disarm) his armed opponents and knocking them off balance. (Knockdown, Improve Knockdown) Many of the knight's opponent have a hard time standing up to one blow due to his/her incredible strength. (Overwhelming Critical, Devastating Critical) <br><br>Perception<br>The knight is far from dimwitted and honed his/her sight and hearing. (Spot, Listen) The knight has good senses and is capable of weeding out the unusual. It's very hard to fool a knight by cloaking one's self. <br><br>Well Versed<br>The knight is very hard to take with any minor spell for his/her will and determination keeps him/her from fall immediately. Where most warriors fall due to the shear lack of will, a knight's unyielding courage (Iron, Will, Epic Will) allows him/her to keep going in the face of danger.<br><br>Pros<br>- The Knight Build is blessed with a huge Strength score, which allows for him/her to carry more items, deal more damage and aquire a higher DC on devastating criticals.<br><br>- The Knight Build nets a HP of 500, making him/her the perfect tank.<br><br>- The Knight Build has Well-Rounded saves.<br><br>- The Knight build is straight forward and easy to level up. The Knight build begins to pick up at level 17.<br><br>- The Knight build will obtain a lot of feats; granting him/her the ability to disarm or knockdown his/her opponent in situations where critical hits are useless, allowing him/her to hold her own.<br><br>- The Knight build can listen in on invisibile enemies and spot enemies that use stealth.<br><br>Cons<br>- Lacks Concentration skill<br><br>- Devastating Critical isn't widely accepted so you might want to be prepared to substitue Devastating Critical with Called Shot.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 20:13</span></i></p>
