Of course the -2 AB penalty would hurt a little bit. But your will save is still very low compared to the possible Terrifying Rage DC (&gt;40). So Iron Will doesn't help much (does Slippery Mind help? I'm not sure, the rage isn't a spell after all). Better take Great Fortitude to avoid Dev.

Combined with Stealth Focus and Trap setting he would be in for a treat if you can create epic traps. Wouldn't even need SC. Without magic equipment he'll be easy to hit anyway. Trap up the place with epic traps, and  shoot your heart out. Get around a corner or lure him into a trap and hide, trap and shoot. One problem is that he's faster than you, so melee weapons will get you in trouble. Drop mobility, with modified tumble at 15 you won't generate AoO. Drop further increases in tumble, he'll only miss you on a roll of 1 anyway.
