Does it stack with items that have damage resistance and damage immunity?<br><br>like if i have a belt that give -5 piercing and -5 slashing damage resistance and armor that gives 5% piercing and 5% slashing damage immunity, would all of that stack with barbarian damage reduction?<br>_________________<br>Where we belong, there's no one to hurt. It's someplace we can't be felt. Where we belong it's darker than space, a feeling that we all push down until we can't be found

<!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 02/08/10 11:26 (GMT) -- mining monk<br><br> reduction from feats stacks with everything except resistance</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Wrong. Reduction stacks with resistance no matter the source. EDR stacks with Perfect Self's 20/+1. EDR, Barbarian's and DWD reduction stack with each other. Reduction from other sources do not stack between themselves nor with reduction from feats/class features (which are technically feats).<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die
