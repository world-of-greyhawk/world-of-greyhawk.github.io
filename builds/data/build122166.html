Inspired by Mith's Lone Ranger and Torias' Rogue Archer, I set out to create a stealthy build that used a crossbow in conjunction with Devastating Critical. This character combines all of the support abilities of the bard with the ever-useful Hide in Plain Sight ability of the Shadowdancer. This build only gets three attacks a round before Haste, but it makes those shots count, using the many buffs available to the Bard class to boost its accuracy and damage.<br><br>In addition to the heavy crossbow, I have the character carry a morningstar with them for meleeing undead and construct opponents, who will be a bit of a problem in the absence of Sunburst or Crumble scrolls. The last four feats you get are pretty flexible, and I have only included one possible setup. You may want to pick up Devastating Critical: Morningstar, or you may want to improve the defensive abilities of the build by including Lasting Impression, Armor Skin, and Epic Toughness.

Quote: Posted 04/09/04 22:57:21 (GMT) by Herbie Shimmer<br><br>    Is there a feat you need from the Shadowdancer class in particular? I generally only take an SD past 1st level if I'm going for Epic Dodge. As you're not, maybe you should leave SD at 1 and put the other 3 levels into Bard, to get another bonus feat. I guess there's an argument for taking 2 levels of SD to retain your Dex bonus to AC even when flat-footed, but I think the build could gain more from an extra feat. Although, I'm not entirely sure what you'd spend it on. <br><br><br>There are two main reasons I took 4 Shadowdancer levels. The first reason was to pick up Evasion. The second reason was to minimize pre-20 BAB loss.<br>_________________<br>(sig space for rent)
