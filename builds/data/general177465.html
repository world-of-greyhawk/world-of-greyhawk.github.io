I think I've got pretty much exactly what you're looking for, and I actually have multiple variations of it.  My original build is called the Infernal Thug, and it's a Human Rogue 13/Fighter 12/Cleric 15.  <br><br>I revised it as a Dwarven Rogue 13/Cleric 21/Fighter 6, who doesn't get quite as much Str or as many skill credits, but who does get 9th level spells and Hellball.  The downside is that it gets an XP penalty at higher levels.    <br><br>In addition, I've got a couple Dex-based variants, one of which who uses a Rapier and small shield and the other of which uses dual shortswords (both are Dwarven).  <br><br>You might also want to check out Mithdradates' Harbinger of Chaos build, as it's actually quite similar to mine and very good as well.  <br><br>Just a note on the 4 attacks thing:  If your character gets 4 attacks/rd unbuffed (+16 base AB or better), then when you buff him up your 4th attack per round will be made at your full AB minus 15.  If you only get 3 attacks per round unbuffed, then when you cast Divine Power on yourself and get that 4th attack per round, it will now be made at your full AB.  <br><br>Thus, although your AB for all attacks will be (at least) 1 point lower, you're still probably going to hit more often when you're buffed if you only have 3 attacks/round base, because you effectively just gained +14 AB to that 4th attack.  <br><br>Other things to note: <br><br>1)  If I recall correctly, True Seeing does not remove the miss chance from concealed creatures.  Thus, although not all of my builds include it, Blind Fight is a feat that you will probably want. <br><br>2)  If you really want to max your AC, you will not only want to max Tumble, but also pick up a Tower shield and possibly take Armor Skin as well.  Although Mith's build uses a Greatsword (which is cool, I admit), a Tower shield with Magic Vestment can give you up to +8 AC, and Armor Skin will give you another +2, for a whopping +10 AC. <br><br>3)  Certain Rogue skills, like Hide, Move Silently, and Set Trap suffer a penalty from wearing armor or shields.  Thus, if you wanted to wear heavy armor and a tower shield, these skills would be quite a bit lower than they should be, which is one of the main reasons I don't include them in this build.   <br><br>Now that I have finished pontificating, I will post my latest version of the build for your perusal:<br><br>Revised: <br><br>Infernal Thug<br><br>Rogue 11/Cleric 19/Fighter 10<br>(pre-epic Rogue 4/Cleric 13/Fighter 3)<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Domains: Trickery<br>         Travel, Strength, or Healing<br> <br>Note:  Travel is most useful if you don't have access to perma-haste items; if you do, then Strength or Healing would probably be preferable)<br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 15 <br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 14 <br>Wis 16<br>Cha 8<br><br><br>You then put 3 points into Wis and 7 points into Str.<br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 26<br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 14 <br>Wis 19<br>Cha 8<br><br><br>Feats<br><br>1 Power Attack, Toughness, Fighter: Cleave <br>3 Weapon Focus: Scimitar <br>6 Extend Spell<br>9 Blind-Fight  <br>12 Knockdown, Fighter: Improved Knockdown<br>15 Improved Crit: Scimitar <br>18 Great Cleave<br>21 Great Str I, Fighter: Epic Weapon Focus<br>24 Weapon Spec, Fighter: Epic Weapon Spec<br>25 Rogue: Improved Evasion<br>27 Great Str II  Fighter: Armor Skin<br>30 Great Str III <br>33 Great Str IV<br>36 Overwhelming Crit.  <br>39 Dev.
