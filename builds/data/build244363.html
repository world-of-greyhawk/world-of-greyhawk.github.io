Playable level 1-40, PvM or PvP<br><br><br>       The Knight Templar<br>       by Deborah Tyr<br><br><br>“Do Your Duty, and Come What May” ~ Knights Templar Motto<br><br>The Knights Templar; among the most powerful group of knights in Europe, associated with heroic and legendary deeds of justice, yet suffering accusations of heresy, these Knights of Justice continue to be a subject of historical speculation and modern-day controversy. <br><br>Templars are credited with laying the foundations not only for modern international banking, but also the Christian military code which would come to dominate the period, to which the modern military code of honor and conduct can also be somewhat traced. Templars originated in what is today France, and were arguably the most famous of warrior-monks, the other notables being: the Teutonic Knights and Knight Hospitallers of St. John’s (or Knights of the White Cross). <br><br>Templars were sword-wielding monks, who fought valiantly to the death, for the Church. Their “fanatical courage” struck terror in their enemies. Templars believed that knighthood could be a holy form of life, but only when used for "good" purposes. By blending the old code of chivalry with religious idealism, Templars played a key role during the Crusades in recapturing the Holy Land, being responsible for protecting the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and ensuring the safety of European pilgrims who flocked to the area in large numbers. The pilgrims, in turn, made donations to the Templars, whose wealth and power soon spread throughout all of Europe. Many monarchies, including France, were indebted to them. This, however, is said to have in turn upset the ruling powers that be, including the Church, and the Knights Templar were officially disbanded in the early 1300s by order of the Pope. Templar wealth was subsequently confiscated and transferred to the Knight Hospitallers who were chiefly responsible with ministering to the sick, and guarding ships to ensure the arrival of medical and other supplies. <br><br>During this period of darkness, known as the Inquisition, the Templar leader and about 13,000 knights were arrested across Europe on alleged charges of heresy, to which many were tortured into confession. Were the Templars in fact guilty of such crimes as charged, or had they simply become so large an organization as to be viewed as a threat to the powers-that-be, such that they had to be gotten rid of by any available means, including false accusations of heresy?  <br><br>According to historic accounts, the Templar leader emphatically denied all such charges. His famous last words before being put to death by burning at the stake being: “I summon you to meet me at the bar of the Celestial Supreme Court, from which (for you) there (will be) no appeal.”<br> <br>Having suffered humiliation, disbandment, and with their leader so killed, remaining Templars moved to Austria-Germany, Great Britain and, eventually, to North America in pursuit of justice, freedom, and liberty for all. These legendary knights, known today as freemasons (and from whose ranks most of America’s founding fathers are believed to have belonged) continue to be the subject of a great deal of speculation, study, and controversy, and have inspired many fictional works, including the “Quest for the Holy Grail”, to the more recent “Davinci Code”. <br><br><br>Knight Templar – Overview<br>Paladin(8), Bard(16), Champion of Torm(16)<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment:  Lawful Good (Start) / Neutral Good (End)<br>Hitpoints: 416 (436 Singing)<br><br>FINAL STATS:<br>STR: 15 (24)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 13<br>CHA: 13 (20)<br><br>Saving Throws<br>Fort: 38 (40 Singing)<br>Will: 33 (34/35 Owl’s) (37/38 Singing)<br>Reflex: 33 (34/35 Cat’s) (36/37 Singing)<br>•Divine Wrath: +7 all Saves (see below)<br><br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8 (+9 Singing)<br>Immunities: Fear, Disease<br><br>COMBAT STATISTICS<br>BAB: 29, AB (max, naked): +40 (No Buffs); AB +47 (Bull’s, GMW Only), +70-Plus (Divine &amp; Bard (Self-Buffs Only, No Equipment))<br><br><br>Damage: mundane longsword (illustration only)<br>1-8 +*STR Mod., (Crit: 17-20/x2) (15-20 w.

Drop 1 CoT level pre-epic in favor of 1 bard level, taking it up in the epic such that the final level distribution remains the same.<br><br>This will have the effect of increasing your Reflex save by 1...for absolutely no cost at all <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>go on...it's free !

You can start changing alignment as early as level 8, when you finish with your paladin levels.  COT doesn't need to be lawful good, just "non evil."<br><br>I'd also swap the order in which you take lingering song and curse song.  It's a really small change but it will probably make your singing much more effective until you get a few more bard levels (and consequently songs/day).<br><br>You take Cleave kinda late, Cleave's real attractiveness and power as a feat goes down as your level goes up.  If there's another feat you want at any juncture, Cleave'll be a good candidate for replacement methinks.<br><br>Nice build.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Xylophone on 06/19/06 12:51</span></i></p>

Well, COT 12 is +1 to saves, 14 is a COT epic bonus feat and +1 to saves, 15 is a bump in divine wrath powers, and 16 is another +1 to saves.  So I can see why you'd do it, but yeah, I agree that the really juicy stuff in the COT class is front-loaded (+1 to saves and a bonus feat every 2 levels).<br><br>I'd actually consider Pal 8/COT 10/Bard 22 - hooks you up with lasting inspiration and a stronger song.  Or Pal 10/COT 10/Bard 22.  Though Pal 15 or 16 would bring on the Holy Sword goodness.  Still this is a strong build for what it sets out to accomplish, and I can never fault someone for choosing high saves.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Helllo, everyone: so glad you enjoy this character and, as always, some great comments and ideas (&amp; Grim, you're evil (love it) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">   I chose higher COT exactly for the reasons Xylo points out; also, I see the Templars as divine warriors, soldiers. But some interesting tweak ideas re: starting stats and skills def. put forth - sounds very cool, and will check it out (thanks!)<br><br>Av: your point re: the fall of the Templars - yeah, these guys and gals (yes, there were women in their organization, contrary to the philosophy of the powers-that-be at the time; also, Templars accepted "oriental" and "egyptian" influences, early christian gnostic beliefs, and traded with their neighbors, such that they became more "neutral" per se.  This was contrary to the message and marching orders of the powers-that-be at the time. It would, after all, take another 500 years for the US and French Revolutions to take place, and rid the industrial world of feudalism and absolutism forever (and which Templars, now freemasons, are said to have taken part <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      <br><br>The "real" crime of the Templars, however, seems to be that they supported the heretic Luther, the start of the Protestant movement. Luther was also burned as a heretic of course, but this did not stop the movement, as we know. Templars were welcome in Great Britain and Austria-Germany, where they were not charged (or, if they were, they were released. This was not the case in France, where the King happily turned over his Templars (their HQ was in Paris) on promises that his debts would be cancelled). <br><br>Don't want to bore anyone with history, or go into such controversial issues and theories, except to say that, even today, what actually happened, and the reasons therefor, remain as controversial and shrouded in mystery as they did at the time they occurred. Fascinating.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_sleep2.gif">      (yeah, yeah, I know LOL).<br><br>Then, there's the issue of all those "secret rites" - whatever those were. (And fair game for Hollywood, too). All of that being said, do stay tuned, as this forms the subject of another epic character I've currently got in development; it is tentatively called the "Blood Knight -Order of Baphomet" <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">      <br><br>In the meantime, will also check out some of those interesting stat and skill tweaks for this one, which sound so very good! <br><br>So, stay tuned. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">      <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">     <br><br>(And thanks again!)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/19/06 21:41</span></i></p>

Church Encyclopedic entry on the Templars (blames King of France, and are apologetic, stating:<br><br>“There was one feature in the organization of the order which gave rise to suspicion, namely the secrecy. The … disadvantage of secrecy was that it gave an opportunity to the enemies of the Templars (jealous of their wealth and political power) . . . to infer from this mystery every conceivable malicious supposition and base on it the monstrous imputations...Such were the Middle Ages, when prejudice was so vehement that, to destroy an adversary, men did not recoil from inventing the most criminal charges. It will suffice to recall the similar, but even more ridiculous than ignominious accusations brought against Pope Boniface VIII by the same (King of France, when the said Pope Boniface refused to honor the King’s request, which King was heavily indebted to the Templars) <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14493a.htm" target="_blank">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14493a.htm</a><br><br>After humiliation in France, many went on to Scotland (having fought with Richard the Lion-Heart, and thus welcome); a great many others simply joined the Teutonic Order, which subsequently moved its HQ to Austria (later disbanded when questioning Church doctrines, as stated above). Meanwhile, the Portugal (Spanish) branch simply changed its name, and went on to commandeer ships on which Columbus sailed to the New World; all having tales, ripe with adventure (well, except for those who allegedly moved to Switzerland and started up the Swiss banking system, including its famous code of secrecy <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>OK, 'nuff history (just wanted to set the record straight, in light of the movie and all, plus this stuff is just soooo fascinating <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>For more info, see: <br><a href="http://www.templarhistory.com/issue14.html" target="_blank">http://www.templarhistory.com/issue14.html</a><br><br>For those who just want to see some neat images, see:<br><a href="http://alandpeters.tripod.com/knightstemplarera1188to1312/id11.html" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br>OK, now back to the building (stay tuned, folks; all of your great comments. be assured, whether on this one or his arch nemisis (Bahomet) in development, are not gonna be wasted (thanks again)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/20/06 06:38</span></i></p>

Revision Notes:<br>(June 21, 2006)<br><br>•	Switched 1 level of COT for Bard pre-epic, and vice versa epic, to gain +1 Reflex save with no drawbacks;<br>•	Switched the order of Curse Song and Lingering Song, to make self-buffs better, i.e. longer lasting, at an earlier point in the knight’s career, until such time as s/he gets more songs (with curse song immediately following, and also lingering from the get-go in light of the tweak);<br>•	Dropped Cleave in favor of Toughness, for 40 more HPs; Alternatively, could take Extra Smiting (but as this is a divine warrior, so to speak, a melee build, more HPs are always good; still, ES is a valid alternative, especially with a bard song HP buff that is lingering; <br>•	Dropped starting STR 1 point to 14, bumped Int &amp; Cha each up by one, in favor of 43 additional skill points (maxing out UMD &amp; Discipline, and partial training also in Heal), while grabbing that STR point back on leveling, such that all ending stats, etc. remain exactly the same (only with more skills); <br> <br>•	Special thanks: KRS, Xylo, Cats, Avado and, of course, Grim, the master of Norse Lore whose keen eyes and comments are reflected in the above revisions to this character, which is the first in what will be a three-part series.<br><br>•	See also: The Blood Knight (Order Baphomet), being the second in the series, inspired by Avado who queried, and I explore, what a Templar may look like if truly fallen from grace, as in evil, and guilty of the crimes charged by the Pope and King of France. It also accommodates requests from my talented and thoughtful coach team for more paladin goodness, including the holy sword (albeit in a villain-type build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  <br>  <br>•	The third and final character in this series, to be tentatively named either the Teutonic Knight (or Illuminati Warrior, or something along those lines and nature), will contain much more paladin, and is currently in testing/production. So, do stay tuned! <br><br>~ Deborah Tyr (and thanks everyone, once again) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/21/06 17:55</span></i></p>
