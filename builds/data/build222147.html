Here's a battle Cleric that can take a beating and keep coming at you.

However, he should always have Divine Power in reserve to quickly buff himself to a respectable AB.<br><br><b>Initiative</b>: Why the Initiative feats? The Dwarflord was the one that brought them to my attention a while ago and, having played a few builds that use the feats, I've come to believe in their value. (Perhaps it's just perception).<br><br><b>No KD or IKD</b>: IKD requires 13 INT, which this build doesn't have, so that's out. As for KD, I opted for the PA/Cleave line instead and opted to forego KD in favor of the Imp Initiative line.<br><br><b>19 WIS</b>: Yes, I know another WIS would give an extra level 1 and level 5 spell, as well as boost the Will save by 1. If one really wanted it, the simplest solution is drop Superior Initiative and take a GRT WIS at that level instead. If you go this route, you could also drop Imp Init and fit in KD.<br><br><b>Domains</b>: Pick whatever suits for your environment but, all things being equal, I'd probably opt for Trickery and War.<br><br>So, he has a bucket of HPs, self-buffing capability, all Cleric spells, 3 metamagic feats to broaden the spellbook, Damage Reduction, and decent saves (quite good vs spells). I think anyone looking for a battle Cleric should give this one a serious look.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 11/30/05 05:54</span></i></p>

Nice solid battle cleric build here.<br><br>Overall I support your build choices; wis 20 is of modest utility, and for someone without sneak attack I consider KD very optional.  AB isn't even that bad unbuffed, not on par with a purer melee but in the same ballpark as many rogue-AB characters and some dual-wielders.<br><br>Quite well done.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

now this is a battle cleric.  ranks right up there with mith's bone breaker.  brutal.  why is it that dwarves seem to do everything better than everyone else?  fighters, rogues, clerics, everything?!<br>well, i think that your base stats are all pretty strong, except for ab being a little low.  but the higher you get the less that will matter.<br>i agreee about kd not being necessary.  you have spells to play with and without some sneak attack damage i would say it is kinda pointless.<br>i like the EDR added in.  just rounds out the high hp, cleric spells and high saves.  well done, as usual.<br><br>-c<br><br>p.s.: what, no story? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>“If you bring a Ranger with you, it is well to pay attention to him...”
