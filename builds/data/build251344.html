Never played a Druid before, so I wanted to do something unique and different without resorting to cheesey monk tactics.

UMD, Taunt, and Crit Immunity helps to take away the sting of Wis AC, Monk attack schedule, Evasion.  <br><br>I considered going lighter on Druid and taking more PM for Epic Spells and AC, but I felt it was more powerful being undispellable and also having a bit easier time piercing SR.  He’s probably as tough as a Druid caster you’ll find pre-epic, which gives him a lot of flexibility as a character as he goes through Epic.  Tough caster and tough summons to boot, he never peaks as far as power goes, but steadily follows the bell curve up to the end of 40.  It’s a build that would probably get banned in most low-magic servers, though offensively I don’t think it’s as powerful as, say, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225446", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Order of Jormundgandr</a>.<br><br><br><i>Edited title on author's request - Kail Pendragon</i><br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/12/07 16:12</span></i></p>

It's just a pity you don't get the Dracolich model when shifting, that would have looked cool</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Indeed.  Speaking of Caster Druids, I was wondering what other people thought about schools of Focus for Druids.  Mages are usually the stock 2 (Evocation, Necromancy), and most Clerics won't take any, and if they do it is Evocation for Implosion DCs.  But what about Druid?  They seem to have an equal amount of useful spells across the board that force DCs.  What would you all consider to be a good school of focus?  I only chose Transmutation because this build, in pre-epic, has the strongest Drown DC you can get, and it's quite effective since there's no immunity other than making a save.   There's a few other spells that receive synergy (Nature's Balance stands out).  But I was sorely tempted to take Evocation or Necromancy in this build.  I stuck to the Drown tactic.  90% of someone's hitpoints can be pretty damn devastating.  Only works on living creatures, though (I think that includes Outsiders and Aberrations).<br><br><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Nothing to add here, well done and muchos kudos.<br>Cheers,<br>Kail</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Thanks, Kail.  I appreciate your insights on these things.  I tested all day yesterday on the attack schedule, as it seemed fuzzy, and watching it versus rolling back the tape was like two different things.  I used a Regen Spell to separate the rounds, and it turned out he only gets the 49/44/39 combo, though it seems like he gets more.  I think the confusion lies in that he usually hits with all 3 shots, while an opponent with 5 APR hits with 2, maybe 3.  What I couldn't figure out was that in the animatics, there were rounds where he only attacked with his jaws, and then 3 rounds would go by and he only ever attacked with his claws.  <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 08/29/06 23:41:10 (GMT) -- Grimnir77<br><br>Great build too.

Nice build.  I'm not a fan of druids so I can't comment too much.  As I recall conjuration also has some nice spells for a druid like stone hold and a couple more (stone hold +creeping doom <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> ), but I think transmutation is probably your best bet.  A dragon that's immune to critical hits and has that dragon DR as well is going to ruin the day of most melee build and you have good DCs with your druid spells, which next to the mage spells are the most offensive in the game.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Aren't Druids supposed to hate undead? If that's the case as it says in their description, I can't imagine them wanting to become a Pale Master. Of course I don't imagine they would want to summon a mummy or shift into undead either, but they can do those things and nobody even thinks twice. In fact, only Druids can use Undead Shape in NWN. I'm not trying to put down your build, just commenting about some RP stuff (albeit not from a DM's perspective). I'm a big fan of it, particularly Druids, though not so much that I would abstain from using Undead Shape. Immunity to criticals is pretty hard to argue with. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  I am also a fan of the "cheesy, cliche, PGish" Monk addition to Druid builds, though not really the Lawful Neutral thing.

There has been a misunderstanding about what I was aking. For someone to dispel magic from another the caster must overcome a DC made from the opponents caster level + 1d20. The character whos casting greater dispelling gets a roll dice of 1d20 + 15 (assuming his/her caster level is 15 or above). This is used to overcome the DC. <br><br>My question was is this; How can a character of 25+ be not affected by greater dispelling? Doesn't the character need to have at least 35 caster levels?

This sounds like a really fun build, always wanted to try a druid and this sounds like an interesting one to RP (corrupted druid = fun).<br><br>On the PW I play the PM gets caster levels every other level, so I was thinking about taking Druid 20/Bard 4/PM 16.

Does your server allow the PM caster levels top add to the Druid spellcasting?

Echo what Cin said.  It's still a rather attractive alternative, with 4 higher AC and 1 or 2 Epic Spells.  You should get Dragon Shape at around the same time and probably accelerate your PM progression.  The PM levels won't add to your Druid casting stats, though.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I am not confusing anything, I have never played a Pale Master before, except for very early in my "career", when I didn't know how to build anything. I was not really certain whether the PM was considered Undead and therefore would be harmed with divine magic. Thanks for clarifying my doubts.<br><br>My goal with the build I am working on is to re-legalize Puff the Magic Dragon V1, only now you gotta go Druid 18 to get DS. I might post it later this week. Gotta test it first, though.<br><br>Just one more thing, replying your comment on the other topic about me thinking WF was short for Weapon Finesse. You're wrong. I HONESTLY didn't see it. My vision is a little blurry, so much that I couldn't renew my drivers license because I failed the optical exam. I am procrastinating the acquisition of glasses for some reason, but I will get to it eventually.<br><br>Anyway, I have another doubt as to how Pale Master spells interact with Wizard Spells. My original Build had 5 lvls of Wizard and 16 PM, and according to the CBC, it could only cast Wizard spells up to 7th level. I don't understand. How is that supposed to work? How do I get a PM to cast lvl 9 Wizard spells? I would really appreciate the help. I have the INT to cast them, btw, 20 INT... <br><br>Take it EZ!<br><br>P.S.: I know this isn't the place to ask such questions, but I have read other Dwarflord builds where the topic went astray into something completely different than the build itself, and he didn't seem to be bothered by it, so that's why I took the liberty of asking the question here.

My original Build had 5 lvls of Wizard and 16 PM, and according to the CBC, it could only cast Wizard spells up to 7th level. I don't understand. How is that supposed to work? How do I get a PM to cast lvl 9 Wizard spells? I would really appreciate the help.
