I used this build a few months ago on a heavy RP server, I RP'ed him as a Goblin named Waagh. But recently I checked the index to see if I could find a build like it, and... I did! But I checked again and found nothing <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">     so here is Waagh the Goblin. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>"Waagh, thats my name, I think?" he ponders, a tendril of drool runs down his lip and splatters noisely on the wooden floor of the inn. The dark man before him stares, inquisitively, at the little man; he draws a deep breath from the end of his pipe then exhaling the smoke in a ring around the goblins head."What brings you here, little one?" he asks, the goblins face swells with redness and water fills his round eyes. "Uh uhm.. Waagh comes from far place," he points off into the forest which is viewable from the nearby window. "Great magician keep Waagh in his home, all day." the goblin looks at his feet and hands, his hair was singed slightly and a foul odor came from them. "What happened there?" the man asked the pitiful creature. There was a long pause, several smoke rings flew gracefully into the air before the goblin responded. "Waagh ran away, ofcourse..." Behind him a crackle, a sound of thunder, could be heard in the distance. The forest exploded in a fury of flame. Evil spirits ran through the town, sacking and pillaging the town. The goblin scurried off into the cellar, but something fell from his pocket. He fell noiselessly onto the ground, and the man went to inspect it. "Dear God," he fingered the parchment carefully, then ripped it viciously into a thousand fragments. The area surrounding him began to glow a deep red, and a hum could be heard in the distance. He looked out the window, the glass had melted, and saw the silhouette of a man, clothed in fire, in the distance. The silhouette pulled a scroll quickly from the mist. The man recognized it instantly, it was the same one he had just destroyed. He ran for cover, but it was too late. A fireball, burning with the intensity of a thousand suns, came smashing mercilessly into the inn and circling the spot where the man once stood. An explosion envelopped the small hamlet in a horrific hellball of heat and energy.<br>Already in the distance the little figure of Waagh could be seen, running faster than he did at the last town, and the remaining skin falling off of his left arm....<br><br>Waagh the Goblin<br><br><b>Playable 1-40 PvM</b><br><br>Race: Gnome<br>Subrace: Goblin <br><br>Wizard: 28<br>Palemaster: 10<br>Shadow Dancer: 2<br><br>Starting Stats<br>Str 6<br>Dex 14<br>Cons 18<br>Intel 17<br>Wis 9<br>Cha 8<br><br>Finishing Stats<br>Str 6<br>Dex 14<br>Cons 18<br>Intel 28<br>Wis 9<br>Cha 8<br><br>Primary Skill points to concern <br>Concentration 48<br>Hide 30<br>Move Silently 29 <br>Spellcraft 51<br>Tumble 37<br><br>1 Wizard Concentration 4, Spellcraft 4, Tumble 2 (cc), Hide 2 (cc), Move Silently 2 (cc) Combat Casting <br><br>2 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Listen 1 (cc), Lore 1 <br><br>3 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Lore 1, Tumble 1 (cc) Toughness <br><br>4 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Move Silently 1 (cc), Hide 1 (cc) Intelligence <br><br>5 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Hide 1 (cc), Tumble 1 (cc) Spell Penetration <br><br>6 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Lore 4 Dodge <br><br>7 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Move Silently 1 (cc), Tumble 1 (cc) <br><br>8 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Move Silently 1 (cc), Hide 1 (cc) Intelligence<br><br>9 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Move Silently 1 (cc), Hide 1 (cc) Mobility <br><br>10 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Spot 1 (cc), Tumble 1 (cc) Greater Spell Penetration <br><br>11 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Move Silently 1 (cc), Hide 1 (cc) <br><br>12 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Lore 1, Tumble 1 (cc), Spot 1 (cc) Empower Spell Intelligence<br><br>13 Palemaster Concentration 1, Hide 3, Move Silently 3 Bone Skin <br><br>14 ShadowDancer Hide 3, Tumble 8 Hide in Plain Sight, Light Armour Proficiencies <br><br>15 Wizard Concentration 2, Lore 2, Spellcraft 3 Quicken Spell <br><br>16 Palemaster Concentration 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 4 Spellcraft 1 Animate Dead Intelligence<br><br>17 Palemaster Concentration 1, Hide 3, Move Silently 2 Spellcraft 1 Darkvision <br><br>18 Palemaster Concentration 1, Hide 2, Move Silently 3 Spellcraft 1 Maximise Spell, Summon Undead <br><br>19 Palemaster Concentration 1, Hide 3, Move Silently 2 Spellcraft 1 Deathless Vigor <br><br>20 Palemaster Concentration 1, Listen 3, Hide 1, Move Silently 2 Spellcraft 1 Undead Graft Intelligence<br><br>21 Palemaster Concentration 1, Listen 4, Hide 1, Move Silently 1 Spellcraft 1 Tough as Bone, Epic Spell Penetration <br><br>22 Palemaster Concentration 1, Listen 4, Hide 1, Move Silently 1 Spellcraft 1 Undead Graft <br><br>23 Palemaster Concentration 1, Listen 4, Hide 1, Move Silently 1 Spellcraft 1 Summon Greater Undead <br><br>24 Palemaster Concentration 1, Listen 4, Hide 1, Move Silently 1 Spellcraft 1 Deathless Mastery, Deathless Mastery Touch, Improved Combat Casting Intelligence<br><br>25 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Heal 6 <br><br>26 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Heal 6 Great Intelligence <br><br>27 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Heal 7 Armour Skin <br><br>28 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Heal 7 Intelligence<br><br>29 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Heal 6, Lore 1 <br><br>30 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Lore 7 Automatic Quicken Spell 1 <br><br>31 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Heal 2, Lore 1, Tumble 2 (cc) Automatic Quicken Spell 2 <br><br>32 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Heal 1, Lore 1, Listen 3 (cc) Intelligence<br><br>33 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Appraise 2 (cc), Tumble 1 (cc), Lore 1, Heal 1 Epic Spell: Epic Mage Amour <br><br>34 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Appraise 3 (cc), Lore 1, Heal 1 Epic Spell: Epic Warding <br><br>35 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Appraise 3 (cc), Lore 1, Heal 1 <br><br>36 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Appraise 3 (cc), Lore 1, Heal 1 Epic Spell: HellBall Intelligence<br><br>37 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Appraise 2 (cc), Tumble 2 (cc) Epic Spell: Greater Ruin <br><br>38 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Appraise 3 (cc), Lore 1, Heal 1 <br><br>39 Wizard Concentration 1, Spellcraft 1, Appraise 3 (cc), Tumble 1 (cc) Automatic Quicken Spell 3 <br><br>40 ShadowDancer Hide 1, tumble 14 Evasion, Uncanny Dodge 1 Intelligence<br><br>Key:<br>Level/Class/Skills<br>CC = Crossclass<br><br>Notes: Sorry guys I checked the Index using the Search Engine this time, and found the build I was looking for (good search engine).
