I have seen similar builds for the below character like Tal Rasha posted, but they all seemed to lack epic spells (I did not look through all the threads, sorry if this was already posted).<br><br><br>Name: Grim Reaper<br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Chaotic Evil<br><br>Final Build :<br><br>4 lvl bard/10 lvl RDD/26 lvl pale master.<br>Final Stats<br><br>The character hat natural immuninties to the following<br>Fire, paralyzation, sleep, sleep, stun, hold, critical hits<br><br>Major Feats:<br><br>Power attack<br>Cleave<br>Greater Cleave<br>Overwhelming Critical<br>Devasting Critical<br>Two Weapon Fighting<br>Ambidexterity<br>All Epic Spells (Hellball and Dragon Knight are awesome)<br>Weapon Focus bastard sword<br>Epic Weapon Focus<br><br>Note:<br>Epic Spells are not effected by armor casting penalties<br><br>The greater summon undead at level 26 PM will produce a level 19 Alhoon wizard.<br><br>No gear AC = 40<br>No gear attack bonus = 31/26/21<br><br>With good gear found in the HotU module and casting epic mage armor spell, you can get this character to an AC of high 70’s – low 80’s. Ditching the offhand bastard sword and replacing it with a good shield you can get into the high 80’s to low 90’s.<br><br>Building character<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>str 14<br>Dex 14<br>Con 13<br>int 16<br>wis 8<br>cha 11<br><br>level progression<br><br>3 levels BRD<br>2 levels PM<br>10 levels RDD<br>24 levels PM<br>1 level BRD<br><br>Increase stats<br><br>int at levels 4 and 8<br>dex at level 12<br>str at levels 16, 20, 24<br>con at level 28<br>str remainder of the levels<br><br>Keep maxing out concentration, spellcraft to 34 ranks. At the last level of bard, max out discipline and tumble. I like to have a high use magical device for this enables using class restricted items. The remainder points are up to you.<br><br>Alternate:<br><br>Instead dual bastard swords, the above character with a +10 scythe w/ 2d6 acid and the character wearing a cloud giant belt will produce huge critical hits. I was getting critical hits in the 180’s – 190’s.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 02:46</span></i></p>
