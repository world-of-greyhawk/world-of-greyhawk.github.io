The Knight Commander is Playable 1-40, PvM or PvP<br><br>Note: in keeping with the medieval knight orders, in addition to the “Big-Three” (Templars, Hospitalers, &amp; Teutonic), there were numerous other little orders, such as the Thistle Knights in Scotland, and the Livonian Knights in Poland/Lithuania. This build is in keeping with the theme; players familiar with the other three builds will note, however, that this is more of a power-paladin build than are the others, which I build quite some time ago, and decided to dust off and re-tweak a bit before bringing him/her here following an enjoyable discussion I had with Mick Dagger and Finneous. Because it's more of a power-build, this character is purposely limited in terms of its skill-set; nevertheless, I hope everyone enjoys this character and, as always, welcome your comments and feedback. ~ Deborah Tyr <br><br><br>Knight Commander (Order of the White Rose)<br>Fighter(6), Paladin(24), Champion of Torm(10)<br>Human, Lawful Good<br><br>STR: 16 (22)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 10<br>CHA: 15 (25)<br><br>Hitpoints: 480<br><br><br>Saving Throws <br>Fort:      38 (+2 Protection, +5 Divine Wrath)<br>Will:      29 (+2 Protection, +5 Divine Wrath)<br>Reflex:  28 (+2 Protection, +5 Divine Wrath)<br>Immunities: Fear, Disease, Death Magic (Death Ward)<br><br><br>Combat Vitals:<br><br>BAB: 30, AB +40 (No Buffs) / +47 (Bull’s, GMW Only)<br>+5 Divine Favor<br>+1 Bless<br>+1 Aid<br>+1 Prayer<br>+5 Divine Wrath<br>--<br>AB +60 (Self-Buffs Only, No Equipment)<br><br>*Smiting AB: Adds Cha-Bonus to Attack Roll (or, AB +71/72, with Aura &amp; Eagle’s Only)<br><br><br>Damage Calculation:<br>Mundane Long Sword, 1-8 +*Str Mod.

Hey, Grim: glad you like him <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">   <br><br>As to the type of damage enhancement re: smiting, in PnP was always just that, an enhancement, as in physical damage. One of the places I test epic characters before taking 'em PvP, is the player-created mod Arena, which is an insane high-magic kinda place, but tends to be accurate on stuff, and it tells me that NWN smite is sonic. <br><br>As an aside, I also like that mod/challenge 'cause I can pretty much assess rather quickly how well a character will do (without using all of the buffs and other things so provided): if it gets through on its own, I typically find that it does well in a nice variety of other environments (plus, it's an easy leveler <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> . <br><br>Nevertheless, when I first tried that mod with a pally and saw "sonic", I tried to look it up in WiKi once, as that too caught my eye, but couldn't find anything at the time. I know that Bioware changed quite a number of things from the D&amp;D rules (to which of course they're entitled to do), and just assumed then that this was the case re: smite and dropped it. So, I haven't looked at scripts or anything else to otherwise question the result. However, there seemingly being a lot of strange things going on with mods, servers and the like, it  would be a good thing to test this, to be 100-% sure, not only for my own purposes but everyone else's. Thus, I'm happy to take the pally out for a smiting test drive and pay attention. If I find out before you, I'll post it here; conversely, if you find out first ... <br>(hey, certainty is always good <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>Back soon <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/23/06 06:30</span></i></p>

Thanks for that info, Finn. Yeah, I thought it should be, and Grim says so also. But Arena insists it's sonic &amp; as stated above, nothing to tell me otherwise, so I assumed it was correct (well, OK, never looked further into it by checking scripts or anything, this is true; however, next time something seems "off" from the PnP rules, gonna check it out in the Official Campaign just to be sure. While many changes have been made, for "balance" reasons, it's hard to know sometimes what's what...(&amp; teaches me never to assume anything when it comes to anything other than the OC 'cause, you know what they say, when you assume you make an A** out of U and Me (seriously, I appreciate the confirmation on that, as was gonna check it in the OC meself later today - certainty is def. good - thanks!)<br><br>...and, uh, uh, uh, with that, could we possibly get an edit on this and the Teutonic build to remove the "sonic" statement, pretty please and thankyou, with a dragon's horde of gold on top? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">    <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/23/06 11:15</span></i></p>

24 lvls of paladin makes the character almost immune to greater dispelling. 25 lvls makes it immune.<br>Taking away 1 lvl from fighter costs 1 feat.<br>Taking away 2 lvls from fighter also costs 1 feat. <br>Adding 2 lvls to paladin gives 1 epic bonus feat and also makes it immune to greater dispelling.<br>If you take 4 lvls of fighter and weapon specialization pre epic, you can still get epic weapon specialization on a COT lvl!<br><br>But what you end up with then is - well, you've already seen it... <br>I guess I'm a bit biased <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"><br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan

Just did some research re: dispel magic, and found this on the NWN boards:<br><br>Dispel rolls a 20-sided die and adds your caster level up to a maximum dependent on the type of dispel against each spell found. If a dispel check is greater than or equal a DC of 11 plus the opposing caster's level, the spell is removed.<br><br>And so, it would seem that no skills, nor any saves, have anything to do with it, other than caster level (as in, the victim's caster level +11, vs. caster's level (to a pre-determined max.) +1d20); and so, pally 26 in and of itself could avoid this effect, with nothing more? This is very good to know, and would qualify as an improvement for sure (and also that really neat undead HD, too, of yours of course - while losing nothing in the process. If so, that's pretty cool alright! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>note: although, gotta point out, and so totally interesting, that Mick's build has +39 AB and Great Smite 3, but with slightly better saves, and +3 AC, which is also nice; I still can't get over how close the build was to the original Teuton build, even although totally different level splits - so very interesting (and thanks again so much for sharing &amp; the dispel info is so very good to know <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/23/06 13:48</span></i></p>
