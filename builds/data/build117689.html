<b>Straight level 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>Here's a divine-based build you might want to try. I based it around the concept of a grim reaper but realised it worked better as a Good character than an Evil blackguard type. Left the scythe in though, because it looks so so cool.  I've used this myself but I can't remember exactly when I took which feats so some might be a little off.<br><br>Race: Human<br>Stats (start)<br>Str 14<br>Dex 8<br>Con 10<br>Wis 13<br>Int 12<br>Cha 17<br><br>For skills I took Discipline, Persuade, cross-classed Tumble and saved points for use in Spellcraft. I can't remember exactly how I did it but I ended up with full 43 ranks in Discipline and Spellcraft and 20 in Tumble.<br>Progression (lvl 20): 10 Paladin -&gt; 4 Champion of Torm -&gt; 6 Cleric<br>Epic Progression: 18 Champion of Torm -&gt; 2 Cleric<br>which finishes 10 Paladin / 22 Champion of Torm / 8 Cleric<br>At every stat increase I maxed Charisma.<br><br>Feats:<br>1 - Exotic Weapon Proficiency, Weapon Focus Scythe<br>3 - Power Attack<br>6 - Divine Might<br>9 - Extra Smiting<br>12 - Cleave, Great Cleave*<br>14 - Improved Critical Scythe*<br>15 - Divine Shield<br>18 - Extra Turning<br><br>The * denotes the CoT bonus feats. You may have noticed that despite having 6 Cleric levels I only have 12 Wisdom so only 2nd level Cleric spells can be cast. Never fear! Great Wisdom is for some reason a CoT bonus feat. Again, for the epic feats, * denotes a CoT bonus feat.<br><br>21 (level 5 CoT) - Great Charisma 1<br>22 - Great Wisdom 1*<br>24 - Great Charisma 2, Great Wisdom 2*<br>26 (level 10 CoT) - Great Smite 1<br>27 - Great Smite 2<br>30 - Great Smite 3, Great Smite 4*<br>33 - Great Smite 5<br>34 - Great Smite 6*<br>36 - Great Smite 7<br>38 - Great Smite 8<br>39 (level 7 Cleric) - Great Charisma 3<br><br>Finishing stats should look like this:<br>Str 14<br>Dex 8<br>Con 10<br>Wis 14<br>Int 12<br>Cha 30<br>I can't remember which clerical domains I took. Probably Magic and Healing as they're my two favourite.<br>Divine Might and Divine Shield give you a +10 bonus to damage and AC respectively, for 10 rounds.<br><br>Divine Wrath (I think, I can't remember) +9 to attack, damage and saving throws for 10 rounds, with 15/+3 damage reduction.<br><br>Lay on Hands gives 320 points of health, once per day. Or 320 points of damage to undead.<br><br>Smite Evil gives you +10 to attack and +288 (9*32) to damage. Yes, +288.<br><br>Level 4 Cleric spells give you decent buffs, including Stoneskin if you take Magic domain. I might have dropped one of the Great Smite feats in favour of Extend Spell actually; the buffs tend to run out quite quickly if you don't.<br><br>Oh, and don't forget how cool the scythe looks. If you don't agree, you could always drop Exotic Weapon Proficiency and get Extend Spell or something instead.<br><br>Edited By Herbie Shimmer on 03/01/04 13:13:29<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 17:05</span></i></p>
