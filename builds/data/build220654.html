<i>This build is ment for PvP or PvM playable 1-40</i> You'll get a high AB, great critical DMG and good HPs. I also added an Extend Spell feat so your spells last longer. I maxed his Taunt Skill giving you a better chance for you later attacks to possibly hit as well.

there are a few mistakes:<br><br>1. truestrike is a spell only wizards and sorcs have acces to.<br><br>2. you cannot raise your ab by more than 20 points with spells or weapon - the max ab of a build is bab+str or dex mod+ wf+ewf+prowress +20 ( smites and probably the divine wraith are the only feats that can exceed this cap )  <br><br>3. you mention that you have 2 lvl3 spells and suggest keen and haste , but also you take armor prof heavy so i assume you want to go in fullplate ...with acrane spellfailure of 45% ... a better chocie would be displacement , can be caast in armor and gives you conceal , tough only for 8 rounds in your build. <br><br>but the rest is nice !

Actually I seem to remember noticing in some testing I did that bardsong went over the +20 AB cap as well.  I tested it by using a true strike scroll with a bard, then singing.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Nice build. Maybe it's just me, but wouldn't RDD dex builds work also (I don't mean any combination in particular like this one)? I know they are more suited to str builds, but all the other nice RDD things are still good, and the +4 ac would go well with the dodge ac also...

lol, bad boy and I have been pushing these classes around.<br><br>I would take bard to 7 pre-epic and rdd to only 8 - you save an AB that way, which gets you to the sick, sick 49 that my All-Offense Dragon Skald gets, but with a better weapon than spear.

ya overall i cant get the AB to 49 i tried. i think its because i had to foobar Weapon Master so late. by picking martial weapons and then greataxe i loose 2 weapon master levels i think that you are talking about.<br><br>overall i like this build. its actually PvM friendly with more options to do more things.

The maximum AB possible is an AA build at +89 or so (can't remember the exact number).<br><br>For melee, the maximum is about +84.
