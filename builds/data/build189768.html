<b>Playable from level 1 - 40  ..PvM Build</b><br><br>Well, I was looking at some of the massive sneak damage I have made recently and quickly realised that there was only one way to go any further with the concept.  This was to increase the number of attacks/round, the 6/round dual wielder managed 180d6 sneak damage per round,wheras this monk variant reaches a not unimpressive 216d6 sneak damage/round (potentially), thats a theoretical maximum of 1296 sneak damage/round.<br><br>Anyway, here is the build:<br><br>Race: Elf, Alignment: LE<br><br>Starting stats:<br><br>Str 10, Dex 18, Con 12, Wis 10, Int 14, Cha 12<br><br>level progression, feats, stat raises etc....<br><br>Lv 1 = rogue, dodge<br>Lv 2 = monk<br>Lv 3 = monk, wpn finesse<br>Lv 4 = rogue, dex +1<br>Lv 5 = rogue<br>Lv 6 = rogue, ambidexderity<br>Lv 7 = monk<br>Lv 8 = monk, dex +1<br>Lv 9 = BG, Knockdown (need 5 ranks in hide by this point)(<br>Lv 10 = BG<br>Lv 11 = rogue<br>Lv 12 = rogue, dex +1, improved knockdown<br>Lv 13 = rogue<br>Lv 14 = rogue<br>Lv 15 = rogue, 2 weapon fighting<br>Lv 16 = rogue, dex +1, improved evasion<br>Lv 17 = rogue<br>Lv 18 = BG, improved 2 weapon fighting<br>Lv 19 = BG<br>Lv 20 = rogue, dex +1<br>Lv 21 = rogue, defensive roll, wpn focus kama<br>Lv 22 = rogue<br>Lv 23 = rogue<br>Lv 24 = rogue, dex +1, improved sneak attack(ISA)1, ISA 2<br>Lv 25 = rogue<br>Lv 26 = rogue<br>Lv 27 = rogue, ISA 3, ISA 4<br>Lv 28 = rogue, dex +1<br>Lv 29 = rogue<br>Lv 30 = rogue, ISA 5<br>Lv 31 = rogue<br>Lv 32 = rogue, dex +1, ISA 6<br>Lv 33 = rogue, ISA 7<br>Lv 34 = rogue<br>Lv 35 = rogue<br>Lv 36 = rogue, dex +1, ISA 8, ISA 9<br>Lv 37 = rogue<br>Lv 38 = rogue<br>Lv 39 = rogue, ISA 10<br>Lv 40 = rogue, epic dodge<br><br>So we finish with 16 d6 sneak damage from the rogue levels, 1d6 blackguard sneak attack and another 10d6 sneak damage from improved sneak attack feats, dual wielding 2 kamas gives an attack schedule of 34/31/28/25/22/19 (main hand) and 34/31 (offhand), unbuffed.<br><br>Saving throws at lv 40 unbuffed are: fort 24, ref 33, will 20<br><br>Final stats are:<br><br>Str 10, Dex 28, Con 12, Wis 10, Int 14, Cha 12<br><br>The last rogue level at 40 is necessary for having epic dodge, however if this dosen't appeal to your tastes, then epic dodge can be swapped for blinding speed, which would give another attack/round from haste.  Alternatively, level 40 can be replaced with a monk level to max out discipline and concentration or a blackguard level to max out discipline, concentration, taunt and get a succubus summon 1/day, which might be good as a diversion so you can get the first few sneak attacks in.<br><br>Comments/suggestions are welcome.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 04/30/05 16:25</span></i></p>

Why not take 2 more monk levels to get improved knockdown for free.<br><br>I would also say that epic dodge should be taken earlier in the build in place of one of the improved sneak attacks.<br><br>For example the difference between having 18d6 and 19d6 damage on a successful sneak is negligible. The difference between having /not having epic dodge is massive.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

I agree completely, if I was actually going to play this, rather than post a min/maxed thing, Id almost certainly take epic dodge around level 30ish and probably drop the final rogue level (and 1d6 sneak damage) and replace with a final blackguard level.<br><br>Regards taking 6 monk levels pre epic, that would severly damage the char, since the base attack of 16 at 20 would then require an 8/8/4 split in the levels, thereby reducing the sneak attack damage and hence delaying the point at which the improved sneak attack feats can be taken.

I have just had a thought about abusing the monk class even further and dropping it to a single monk level, replacing the 3 monk levels with BG levels would preserve the BAB and garner another d6 of sneak damage.  This would take the sneak attack dice/round up to 224 d6 if the original build plan (or something similar) was kept to post epic.

Nobody said take 6 monk levels pre-epic. Just take 6 total (4 pre-epic, 2 epic) to get Improved Knockdown (and an additional boost to speed).<br><br>Regarding your uber-cheezee <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   revelation to take only 1 level of monk, you could compromise and take 3 to get the boost of Monk Speed.<br><br>Also, how does the build look if you go Halfling instead of Elf to avoid the XP penalty? <br><br>Nice build.

Well, if you become a 0.5ling then you will get an extra point of Ab from the small stature feat, however, this would mean that you cant knockdown larger creatures.  So essentially its a case of sacrificing apples for pears in that case.<br><br>Maybe taking two monk levels in epic levels would be worth it to get free improved knockdown, but in all honesty I think that this is taking more sneak damage from the build than is necessary, I think it would push the total sneak damage below the 200 d6/round barrier as well.<br><br>Even so, I will experiment further, thanks for your comments so far folks.

Well, i called it a monk because I honestly couldn't think of a half decent name for the char build.

Well yes, the AB isnt up to much at all, its more a demonstration of how you could manage ludricrous ammounts of sneak damage, however, assuming that you could get the full +12 of buffs to dexterity and a coupole of +5 kamas, it begins to look a fair bit better.  With +12 charisma the smite good begins to look okish as well at that point.<br><br>However, as always if you want a really good melee AB then lots of weapon master levels are generally the way to go.
