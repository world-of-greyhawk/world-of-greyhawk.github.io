Why not? I needed some charisma, it added 4 damage. Allowed a tiny amount more skill points <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> . Oh and the immunities set is pretty cool.. and the wings.<br><br>-DaMouse

If you switched the levels around a bit you could get something more or less like sorc 9/monk 21/ palemaster 10 which would give more AC bonuses, spell bonuses, and immunity to crit. hit. And for losing the wings, you can compensate with a cool arm that can strike opponents dead in a hit. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>I'm not sure what level you need to be for level 5 spells, but if you could get to level 5 spells you could get Mestil's Acid Sheath/Elemental Shield/ Death Armor which would deal about 80 damage to an opponent on hit, and with your immunity to crit. hit and high ac...

Since the spell is supposed to be based on melee hits; it kinda means a mage depending on damage shields should go for low ac - making them almost useless (at lvl20; the avg damage they dish out is 80).  At lvl20; a fighting character will hit the mage for easily 50hp (before crit), depending on equipment.  Take into account a common-built mage only has around 100hp or so by that level; take premonition which will only soak 30hp of that IF it is +4 or less; and you have a mage dead before the fighter goes to injured. The shields are more useful with epic warding; but unless you sacrifice your casting ability and go with Palemaster, crits will typically push you over the edge quickly enough.<br><br>Ok; my long rambling point?  Since ac can't be used to counter the damage being given to the mage; you will have to stay out of reach of the melee anyway.

I'd say the pale master idea is much better suited to the wizard as it allows to learn spells afterwards and such<br><br>-DaMouse
