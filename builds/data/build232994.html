Nice! Your attack progression is way off, though. You've +35/+30 unbuffed, +40/+35/+40 with Divine Power and +40/+35/+40/+40 with Haste (not sure what the character sheet says, but that's the real deal so to speak <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <b></b>).<br><br>They're called buffing spells, not buffering, BTW.

Rapid Reload adds the second attack. Without RR, you'd have had only one attack at +35 when testing. Bah!

X-bows ARE stylish. damn, I thought 3 attacks/round was the most one could have with it. DP actually makes it another? Even with 26 BAB? Not bad. Nice build. I think Divine shield, but can you stay away from trouble, then no worries.<br><br>Kudos for this.<br><br>From a power point, using Longbow would outdo it. But you'd only gain 1 attack/round buffed with DP though, so it isn't sure it would be that much better. You could use RR on something else, though.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Oh, no, sorry. I didn't notice he started his career as a Paladin! No, it doesn't add another attack when you already have 4 APR by default. If he'd go with Paladin 1/CoT 2/Cleric 17 pre-epic he'd get the extra attack with Crossbow. My bad.<br><br>A normal Bow can have 6 APR, 4 base +1 Rapid Shot +1 Haste.<br><br>EDIT: the maximum number of attacks with a Crossbow is 5. This can be achieved with a Cleric with 2 base APR (ie. 10 BAB pre-epic). DP then adds two attacks.<br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 03/07/06 21:00</span></i></p>

Alas, but I must express my disappointment with this build.  For where is the Double Crossbow of Speed, belt-fed with a +5 Hasp of Reloading?  <br><br>Ahhh...Once you hold one of those, and stand amidst a field of slaughter, and light up a fresh cigar and inhale the carnage that you wrought, things are just never quite the same.
