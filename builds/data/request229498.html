I'm looking at the Dwarven Wall epic build, and trying to consider how to modify it to take seven levels of WM for the added combat damage. The loss of defensive capability doesn't concern me, but I do play with friends who play pure casters, so I figure the best defense for them is for me to put up a good offense.<br><br>The server I'm playing doesn't have the weapon/armor crafting system implimented, so I can easily scrap the skills from those for the intimidate ranks, with plenty left over. Possibly a Heal investment for the rest?<br>_________________<br>"ROLL THE DICE TO SEE IF I"M GETTING DRUNK!" "URGH." *Rolls dice* "YEAH, YOU ARE!" - Summoner Extras

Yeah, I was looking at that yesterday. I'm thinking rather than the CoT levels in the Dwarven Wall build, I'll just take seven WM levels, and try to salvage the feat progression as best I can. Already got two of the levels down for sure, and the results are interesting, to say the least.

You could try my build, The Masterful Wall Fighter 7, DD 26, WM 7, I'm currently making it better though because the ac wasn't good so once I have the 2nd version on the board you may want to check it out. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif">
