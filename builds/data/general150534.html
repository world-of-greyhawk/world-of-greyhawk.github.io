Have you tried monk/sorc/rdd?  The strength bonus from rdd should help ya with getting dev crit.  That way you can also pump in dex if ya want.  However, I have found that it best to concentrate in either one way or the other when making monks.  Either use a str type build or a dex type build.  It seems whenever you try to combine the two, the char is never as powerful.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.
