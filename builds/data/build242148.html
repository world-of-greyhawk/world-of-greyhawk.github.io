Kamas are worthless unless you have at least one monk level, so playability until then is low. Then again, you did say the build was made for level 40.<br><br>Still, from a level 40 perspective, losing a feat to exotic weapon proficiency isn't worth the one AB that you'd lose from taking monk pre-epic. I'd say go dwarf and take your second level as a monk. You gain 40 HP and lose 1 AB, but playability is increased a bunch.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

I actually was thinking on equipping a greatsword pre-epic to make as much damage as possible with that low STR, no matter the focus is on kama, until I get Monk levels, a greatsword will deal much more, or longsword with a shield.<br><br>Dwarf gets a nasty XP penalty, with Monk at level 2 you'll have 20% Xp penalty since level 4, and 40% at level 25.<br><br>Every AB is worth it IMO, as his AB isn't high, besides, Mithdradates gave me an argument I could not deny, that you do invest in Epic Prowess, which is a feat that gives 1 AB, and Exotic Proficiency works the same here, so I chose to take all Ranger pre-epic.

What I would recommend to make it playable is to mix your classes alittle. You need Rogue pre-epic to get by. You need UMD and sneak-attack. A ranger can rely a bit on his animal and traps, but the animal dies quickly.<br><br>I have tried a DEX-based ranger once (I was very very ill <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  ), and it is really hard to level. As a lvl 40 build this is good, but it becomes quite okay long before that, as soon as your options start to appear, really. Taking Rogue pre-epic will cost AB and you won't get BoE until 27 or 30, so it's a trade-off.<br>As a level 40 build it is quite fine as it is. But like I said, after you get BoE, a monk-level and some sneak attack, then it's good to play. Around 27 or so.<br><br>Rock on Thax.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Forgot for a moment that Weapon Finesse only works with short weapons... grrrr, in that case the kama will be the best looking, either dual or one kama with a shield, damage will be crap at any rate then.<br><br>Heh, it didn't go exactly as I thought it would... when I finished I noticed he was crap pre-epic and decided to clasify him as a level 40 build... then I realized, that 40 builds end playing in PvP most, if not all of the times... at which point my "I thought ingenious" way of countering sneak immunities with BoE went down as that works mostly in PvM... I don't know if shifters count as their shifted class for Favored Enemy effects... if they do, at least dragon should be considered IMO.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;A ranger can rely a bit on his animal and traps, but the animal dies quickly.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I'm thinking that using a shield I'll use my Panther as my sneak damage... might work... in any case, rest often, and feed the little guy very often. I actually found some sort of "trick", as you can feed your companion in the midst of battle, if you stop attacking (i.e. rely on your AC only while you run, and order your companion to follow you) you leave combat mode and are able to talk with the companion to feed him.<br><br>EDIT: Well, I was posting when you posted Mithdradates. Fine observation, I didn't notice, a mere writing error, as I went with the idea that Rogue and normal feats were at the same levels...
