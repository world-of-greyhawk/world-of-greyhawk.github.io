Here's another build for your enjoyment (or to target with seething hatred, whichever you prefer). I think 2 is enough for now. Seeing as I made an Artemis Entreri build, I though it was only fair to make a Drizzt Do'Urden build. Although (just like with Artemis) I had to make some changes that ignored technical accuracy for the sake of playability. <br><br>The most major one being that he's supposed to use scimitars not rapiers. But I tried quite a few different versions before I finally decided on this, and I came to the conclusion that Drizzt is <i>not</i> a strength based build and <b>never will be</b>. <br><br>Seeing as scimitars cannot be used in conjunction with weapon finesse, I bit my thumb and used the closest substitute - rapiers. <br><br>The other thing is that seeing as Drizzt has been trained with all weapons he should probably have Weapon Proficiency: Exotic; but I just didn't feel like wasting a feat on something I'll never use.<br><br>Build Name – Drizzt Do’Urden<br><br>Race – Elf (sub-race Drow)<br><br>Alignment – Lawful Good<br><br>Playable from 1 - 40 <br><br>PvP/PvM - Both<br><br>Stats: Starting (Ending) <br>STR 10<br>DEX 20 (36)<br>CON 10 <br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 10<br><br>HP (Maxed) - 348 <br><br>Naked AC - 31<br><br>AB – 43<br><br>Leveling guide – put all 10 points into DEX<br><br>01: Fighter 1 Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus: Rapier<br>02: Ranger 1 <br>03: Ranger 2 Knockdown<br>04: Ranger 3 <br>05: Ranger 4 <br>06: Ranger 5 Blind-Fight<br>07: Ranger 6 <br>08: Ranger 7 <br>09: Ranger 8 Improved Critical: Rapier<br>10: Ranger 9 <br>11: Fighter 2 Improved Knockdown<br>12: Fighter 3 Called Shot<br>13: Fighter 4 Weapon Specialisation: Rapier<br>14: Fighter 5 <br>15: Fighter 6 Improved Initiative, Disarm<br>16: Fighter 7 <br>17: Fighter 8 Improved Disarm<br>18: Fighter 9 Iron Will*<br>19: Ranger 10 <br>20: Ranger 11 <br>21: Rogue 1 Great Dexterity I<br>22: Rogue 2 <br>23: Rogue 3 <br>24: Rogue 4 Great Dexterity II<br>25: Rogue 5 <br>26: Rogue 6 <br>27: Rogue 7 Great Dexterity III<br>28: Rogue 8 <br>29: Rogue 9 <br>30: Rogue 10 Great Dexterity IV, Improved Evasion<br>31: Rogue 11 <br>32: Rogue 12 <br>33: Fighter 10 Great Dexterity V, Epic Weapon Focus: Rapier<br>34: Fighter 11 <br>35: Fighter 12 Epic Weapon Specialisation: Rapier<br>36: Fighter 13 Great Dexterity VI<br>37: Fighter 14 Epic Prowess<br>38: Fighter 15 <br>39: Rogue 13 Defensive Roll, Epic Dodge<br>40: Fighter 16 Superior Initiative<br><br>Skills  <br>Hide 42<br>Listen 41<br>Move Silently 42<br>Open Lock 13 (+1 at last fighter level)<br>Search 42<br>Set Trap 13 (+1 at last fighter level)<br>Tumble 40<br>UMD 35<br><br>Saves<br>Fort - 23<br>Reflex - 29<br>Will - 17<br><br><i>Suggested Equipment</i><br>Seeing as this <i>is</i> Drizzt and little to none of the equipment used in the books are available in the game, I took it upon myself to make some. <br><br>The only equipment I know that exists in the game already is “Bracers of the Blinding Strike” from SOU (haste, AC +4). <br><br><i>Twinkle</i> (Rapier)<br>Low light, Blue (5m)<br>Enhancement +3 (varies depending on environment)<br>Keen<br>Bonus Slashing damage, 2d6 maximum (varies depending on environment)<br><br><i>Icingdeath</i> (Rapier)<br>Enhancement +3 (varies depending on environment)<br>Bonus Ice damage, 2d6 maximum (varies depending on environment)<br>Fire resistance 15 - 30/ Fire Immunity 50 - 100% (varies depending on environment)<br><br>Also, make an item to make up for the loss of darkness.

Hm, it's not exactly build-specific, but still somewhat on-topic. Drizzt's stats the first time he came around were much easier and more understandable.<br><br>It was what we call AD&amp;D. There were nothing called Weapon Finesse. But high DEX reduced the dual-wield penalty. Iirc Drizzt had 16 STR and 20 DEX, which would give him only -1 to AB when dual-wielding. There were no stat increases either, so even high levels he would only be 2 behind a Full-Strength-Warrior in AB(ThAC0) and another one for Dual-wield. He was a pure ranger, but that was because of strict class rules.<br><br>With 3rd edition a number of problems surfaced for official Drizzt, problems you are facing now. Mostly from Weapon finesse and ability raises. And the fact that STR or DEX gives much better AB when raised compared to back then.<br><br>I hope this clarifies a few things. I can't see Drizzt without scimitars no matter the reason though, they are to much his trademark.<br><br>I would probably do a STR 20, DEX 26 thing which was suggested. And perhaps go Fighter/Ranger/Weaponmaster, or Ranger/WM/SD. I think WM feels right for Drizzt, but so does Epic Dodge. Ranger 21/Rogue13/Fighter6 perhaps to get BoE, EWS AND Epic Dodge with the classes you have chosen.<br><br>And a little note to end my rants, DO NOT POST COMPLETE  AND DIFFERENT BUILDS and discuss them in another one's build-thread.

Well, I'm not the law of Drizzt and how he should be made, but I know some (I don't even know exactly where he comes from... he seems very known around). When I first fought him on BG1 he killed my whole party like in 10 secs (yeah, I was low level <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ), so his THAC0 (AB stuff) and damage were supreme, and since <i>only</i> STR gave bonus to THAC0 and damage, he obviously was STR based. Although again, on BG1, you could be STR and DEX based at the same time...<br><br>Back on BG2 dual wielding penatlies came up to <i>only</i> the dual wielding proficiency and period, of which rangers had an initial bonus, hence, why he as a ranger dual wield scimitars. Anyway, on BG2 you can kill his whole party easily (even with only 1 character), so he stops being a strong guy. As Grim said, he was a pure ranger because of strict class rules.<br><br>According to.. ehm, the equipment I got after killing him, he used a sort of strong magical chanmail of sorts, no heavy armor nor too light either... oddly, he moved pretty fast, you could say he had hasting equipment... but you could also make him a Ranger/Monk for it.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with your build, but there are significant reasons why someone could not understand how you can call your build Drizzt when he doesn't even uses his unique weapons.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/13/06 01:40</span></i></p>

This build does defently not look like drizzt, id say its a black-painted elf, weilding rapiers and going for a crusade with a goal to destroy all evil in the underdark.<br><br>What i point at is ofcourse;<br><br>the weapon u have chosen like eveyone els in here does.<br><br>the alignment, if u chose to throw the scimmys away for a "better" weapon then why do u have to change his alignment aswell? i remember drizzt being CG but i could b wrong...<br><br>Anyway, this is the farest u can get from the actual drizzt u can get in my eyes (cept that LE would be even worse). I agre that he should have that grace in combat but that doesnt necceserry have to mean that he uses it for fighting. it could just be his defensive side.

Big Meph, when you post builds based on heroes, or favorites of many people, you run the risk of incurring their wrath, as you will probably "weaken" the character in their mind, or not even come close to what they envision the character as being. 20 of us could read a book on a certain character, and we could each have our own little variations in our minds of what that character is.  I managed to make my pitifully low will save when I saw your Artemis build, and though I didn't agree with your interpretation of him, refrained from posting anything negative in there.  Artemis and Drizzt are perhaps 2 of my all time favorite characters from Forgotten Realms books, so I understand how all of the previous posters are probably feeling.  Here are 2 links for ya, one for the 2nd Edition Drizzt stats from the The Heroes Lorebook from Forgotten Realms Campaign, and the other the 3E stats from WotC:<br><br><a href="http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/drizzt-2nd.htm" target="_blank">2nd Edition Drizzt</a><br><br><a href="http://www.wizards.com/forgottenrealms/FR_3E_Drizzt.asp" target="_blank">3rd Edition Drizzt</a><br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DarkStar27909 on 07/13/06 09:54</span></i></p>

His alignment is classically CG (because he's honorable and just but doesn't tie himself down with a specific code).

Drizzt is mainly a weaponmaster, as he was trained by the finest weaponmaster there was Zankien. I would say he is more in the lines of WM/Ranger/Fighter. A high Dex chac to get epic dodge. You would also have to take TWF line, so might not be enough feats for everything. just my humble opinion on a old post.

Characters so well developed in thier stories are impossible to do justice with any collection of stats and skill points.  Tiny details are collected and discarded by readers over and over.
