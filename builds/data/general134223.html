I have a 8th level Ranger I'm playing SOTU with.  I am Stuck on what to do with him.  I'm definetly going to 9th level ranger for the improved two-weapon fighting.  After that, I'm not sure.  COT would be fun.  He'd be sort of a ranger/paladin without the exp penalty.  The HIPS of the SD would be cool, but without sneak attack, kind of pointless.<br><br>I've specialed in short swords with weapon finese. I've got power attack and cleave.  I think that covers all of my feats.  My animal companion is a Dire Wolf(for now).<br><br>My Stats are<br>str:14<br>dex:18<br>con:12<br>int:10<br>wis:14<br>cha:10<br><br>Any suggestions?

Like 24 Ranger/16 COT, or maybe take advantage of your cleric levels to gain some huge buffing abilities.  Take magic and war domains, and use a few COT bonus feat to grab a couple great wisdoms.  Distribute levels something like Ranger 9/19 COT/12 cleric.  Take the Ranger levels, then 10 COT, 8 Cleric, 9 COT then finish with cleric levels.  You'll end up with 29 bab, huge buffs, war domain powers etc etc.  Like I said, use the COT epic bonus feats to grab 3 gr wis feats.
