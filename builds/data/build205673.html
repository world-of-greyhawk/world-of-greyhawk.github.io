<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM or PvP</b><br><br>My goal with the Stonedeath build was to have a character that could optimize his sneak attack/knockdown damage.  I chose the assassin because I've always loved the concept of the death attack.  I'm playing with him now on a PvP server and he's doing very well.  I usually stay invisible until the mage's shields wear off then I use improved knockdown coupled with death attack to send them to their graves.<br><br>With Stonedeath, you're going to want heavy armor, a good tower shield, as much AC gear as you can find (remember, he can wear Monk items such as Sun Soul Boots), rings to boost Intelligence (this raises his Death Attack DC), and various other items to raise his Strength.<br><br>Stonedeath, LE Dwarf<br>Fighter 8/Monk 2/Assassin 30<br><br>Levelling Order:<br>Fighter 4<br>Monk 1<br>Assassin 10<br>Fighter 4<br>Monk 1<br>Assassin 20<br><br>Attributes<br>Str 16 -&gt; 26<br>Dex 12<br>Con 16<br>Int 16<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 6<br><br>Skills<br>Concentration 23<br>Discipline 23<br>Hide 43<br>Listen 12<br>Move Silently 43<br>Spellcraft 20<br>Spot 12<br>Tumble 40<br>Use Magic Device 43<br><br>Feats<br>Level 1:  Expertise, Weapon Focus (Longsword)<br>Level 2:  Improved Expertise<br>Level 3:  Knockdown<br>Level 4:  Weapon Specialization (Longsword)<br>Level 6:  Blind-Fight<br>Level 9:  Improved Knockdown<br>Level 12:  Power Attack<br>Level 15:  Improved Critical (Longsword)<br>Level 17:  Great Cleave<br>Level 18:  Toughness<br>Level 19:  Called Shot<br>Level 21:  Epic Weapon Focus (Longsword)<br>Level 24:  Epic Prowess, Epic Reflexes<br>Level 27:  Improved Sneak Attack I<br>Level 28:  Improved Sneak Attack II<br>Level 30:  Overwhelming Critical (Longsword)<br>Level 32:  Improved Sneak Attack III<br>Level 33:  Improved Sneak Attack IV<br>Level 36:  Devastating Critical (Longsword), Improved Sneak Attack V<br>Level 39:  Improved Sneak Attack VI<br>Level 40:  Improved Sneak Attack VII<br><br>BAB:  +26<br>Attack Bonus w/Mundane Longsword:  +38/+33/+28/23<br><br>AC Naked:  19<br>AC w/Full Plate &amp; Tower Shield:  30<br><br>Pros:<br>Evasion<br>Can cast those helpful assassin spells<br>22d6 Death Attack<br>Devastating Critical<br><br>Cons:<br>Only 406 hp<br>Needs Improved Expertise to keep up with AC builds<br><br>So, anyhow.

Looks good to me.  I would suggest taking only 8 Assassin in pre-epic so you can get another AB.  You can do so without breaking the build in epic...well, you may lose an improved sneak, but 1AB vs. 1d6 sneak is a no-contest. <br><br>For those interested, I would also detail Saves and Skills.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 07/26/05 11:25</span></i></p>

Why Monk?  You're not using wis ac or the monk attack progression.  deflect arrows only works when you're unarmed.   using 2 rogue makes more sense to me.  you still get evasion and tumble.  You gain 1d6 sneak (fits build concept), but lose cleave. (maybe switch out improved knockdown to get cleave... regular knockdown works fine for a dwarf).  You can use umd to use monk items anyways, so that is not an issue.<br><br>Did I miss something?<br><br>edit: noticed that assasin gets umd...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By jjjhhhlll on 07/26/05 15:34</span></i></p>

It so happens I was puzzlilng over a DEX version of this build today.<br><br>The only problem I see with the build is that it uses Improved Sneak Attack feats which according to a post from a couple of weeks ago, do not work for an Assassin unless the character has taken at least one level of Rogue.  This is apparently a bug and not intentional.<br><br><a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=441650&amp;forum=42" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

You can choose it as a feat.  It just doesn't work.  It's been tested with combat debugging on, and you can tell from the average damage that you are clearly getting the benefit of just the base assassin damage.  But, if you add in a single rogue level, all of a sudden all that extra Improved Sneak Attack damage starts getting added in.<br><br>Steve
