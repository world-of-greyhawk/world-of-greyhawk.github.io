STR 21, CON 21, and WIS 18.  All the others don't change.  He basically has just enough stat raises and feats to get his WIS high enough for his cleric level and his STR and CON high enough for Mighty Rage.  I'll see if griphook can add those in for me.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;im wondering.. barb 16 cleric 4 pre epic? possible?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Yes, quite easily.  There aren't any pre-epic feats that are cleric specific, and there aren't enough epic feats that are barbarian specific that you couldn't move more barbarian levels pre-epic.  In fact, you could go even further if you really wanted to max BAB.  Technically, you only need 2 of your barbarian levels to be in epic levels.  You need one level to pick up Terrifying rage.  That level would have to be on a feat level at some point after level 22, since you need to raise Intimidate to 25 to get that feat.  You'd also want to make sure you get taunt up to at least 20 at that point so you can pick up Epic Skill Focus (Taunt).  Then, you take your last barbarian level at level 39 to get Mighty Rage.  So, technically, you could go Barbarian(19)/Cot(1) pre-epic, take barbarian(20) at level 33 (picking up terrifying rage and raising intimidate and taunt) and take barbarian (21) at level 39 to get Mighty Rage (be sure to also pick up Epic Skill Focus (Taunt) at level 36 on either a cleric or CoT level).   That way you could move all of your cleric levels to the epic levels.  That would give you the full 30 BAB.<br><br>That would probably be a bit extreme though, especially since you would only have Armor Proficiency Light and Medium until you get a cleric level.  I went with the Barbarian(12)/Cleric(8) combo to get access to buffs like Divine Power, Greater Magic Weapon, Magic Vestment, and Darkfire pre-epic, but a 16/4 mix is definitely easily done.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 05/22/05 08:26</span></i></p>

I don't think any were cleric/druid, but everything else was affected by the terrifying rage, even mages.  A cleric/druid would be the most likely to avoid it though.  It's nice coupled with taunt too.  Even mages were failing their concentration checks against his taunt, and between the two, that's a -2 penalty to AB and saving throws, up to -6 penalty to AC, and a 30% chance of spell failure for the mages.<br><br>The nice thing is that with his concentration skill buffed and raging is 51, and his will save is 36, which makes it very hard for someone to try to use the same tactics against him.  Plus the fortitude save of 41 helps fend off dev crit as well.<br><br>Steve

&lt;Apologies if this is an unwanted "spam" -- moderators, I won't be the least bit offended if you edit/delete this post or re-post it elsewhere if that would be more appropriate.&gt;<br><br>Since it seems like the vast majority of the builds with strong synergy have been done (and, in some cases, done to death), I thought I'd try my hand at class combinations that may not have readily obvious synergy in terms of stats and abilities.  I first came up with the top three under-utilized classes, and thought about combining them.  It's just my opinion, but (with the exception of HS), I feel that the barbarian, blackguard, and druid are all classes that either have limited utility, do not hold up well in higher magic worlds, or generally another class choice that do what they do, only better.<br><br>Instead of tackling that combo, I decided to start with something that seemed easier (and, according to the search tool, no one has tried yet): Barbarian/Druid/CoT.  After fiddling with this combo, I am having trouble decided how to make this build even halfway decent.<br><br>1) The druid class has little or no offensive buffing capability that will synergize with barbarian rage (since it's easy to get max str/con with feats).  In fact, the druid portion of a build like this would basically be for defensive buffs (stoneskin, premonition, etc) and weak nukes (due to the necessity of keeping druid levels low).<br><br>2) Armor class would be fairly low, since this build would be ability starved already and thus dex would be neglected--and no tumble <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br>3) If you want some/all of the meaty barbarian feats, you have to get str, con, and barbarian level to 21.  Also, doing this you will pretty much only be able to take Great &lt;stat&gt; feats and the rage feats themselves.<br><br>I guess I'm opening this up with how someone might build a solid character with these three classes.  Ideas?<br><br>Also, anyone even tinkered with Blackguard/Druid/Barbarian?    <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif"><br>_________________<br>Favorite PW's: Hall of the Worlds, Higher Ground, World of Iniquity.

I considered druid for this build in the first place, but dropped it because it seems to me to be a worse choice than cleric for many of the reasons you stated.  But if you want help on designing a druid/CoT/Barbarian or a druid/Blackguard/Barbarian, you probably should post that in the build request forum rather than in the thread for a different build.<br><br>Steve
