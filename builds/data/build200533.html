<b>Avatar of the Forge</b><br>Dwarf Bard12/RDD10/Fighter18........Playable from 1-40, PvP or PvM<br><br>This build  is a variation of the Half-orc Embassy of Destrucion. Cin had created a "High Saves Meleer"(Favored of Moradin) which was a Rogue/Fighter/CoT, and his saves were excellent. Inspired, I took it to task to create a RDD meleer that came close. It also has appeal in light of the 1.66 fixes for those seeking to captialize on Implosion, Death Attack, etc... He attempts to aim for high saves across the board without having to sacrifice AB, AC or damage, and still maintain a modest amount of hitpoints. Also, it seems that in any RDD build I play, my saves never seem to be good enough, and I'll find my character hiding in a corner from fear while the rest of the party is trying to battle the Ancient Dragon. It seemed that taking 18 levels of Cot instead of Fighter would make his Saves obscene, but he loses offensive punch. <br><br>Feat selection is tricky, as you have to take most of your combat-related feats on all fighter bonus feat levels, and reserve General Feats for Saves and Great Strengths. Great Axe was chosen merely for it's keen potential, x3 modifier, but the build can easily shift to Warhammer/Shield motif at the expense of losing only slight base damage. Actually the AC potential from going with a tower shield might be preferential in this situation. <br><br>Also, I forsook Devastating Critical. He should fare well against such attacks, and his damage output is still good enough in low to modest magic environments that he should be able to dish out a decent amount of damage. For those looking for a Dev Crit build, seek from the other list of 8,000.  If you want this build with Dev Crit, do the following:  push 4 fighter levels to Epic and take 8 RDD in pre-epic.  Drop Great Fort and Iron Will(RDD high saves), and you will have an 8/8/4.  He loses just 1 AB this way.  However, taking those 4 fighters in Epic allow you to keep all the feats you have, as well as picking up Overwhelming and Dev Crit.<br>There are a number of ways to level this build, but leveling priority was decided on what feats could be obtained, and skill  dumps were considered second.  Also, as soon as build goes into Epic he shoots straight for RDD 10 for the immunities.<br><br><i>This is not a min/max build, and should be playable in any environment.</i><br>___________<br><b>Dwarf 12Bard/18Fighter/10Red Dragon Disciple</b><br>Alignment: Any non-lawful<br><br>Str15(36)<br>Int12(14)<br>Wis10<br>Dex12<br>Con16(18)<br>Chr12(14)<br><br>1Bard, LoH<br>2Fighter, Weapon Focus: Great Axe<br>3Fighter, Power Attack, Cleave<br>4Fighter, Str16<br>5Fighter, Wpn Spec: Great Axe<br>6RDD, Lightning Reflexes<br>7RDD<br>8RDD, Str19<br>9Bard, Curse Song <br>10RDD<br>11Fighter<br>12Fighter, Great Fortitude, Knockdown, Str22<br>13Fighter<br>14Fighter, Great Cleave<br>15Bard, Still Spell<br>16Fighter, Str 23<br>17Fighter, Blind-Fighting<br>18Fighter, Iron Will<br>19Fighter, Improved Crit: Great Axe<br>20Bard, Str 24<br>21RDD, Great Str I<br>22RDD<br>23RDD, <br>24RDD Great Strength II, Str27<br>25RDD<br>26RDD<br>27Bard, Great Str III<br>28Fighter, Str33<br>29Fighter, EWF<br>30Fighter, Epic Reflexes<br>31Fighter, EWS<br>32Fighter, Str34<br>33Bard, Epic Will<br>34Fighter, Epic Prowess<br>35Bard<br>36Bard, Armor Skin, Str 35<br>37Bard<br>38Bard<br>39Bard, Epic Fortitude<br>40Bard, Str 36<br>_______________<br><b>Naked AB w/Mundane Axe 45/40/35/30</b><br><br><b>AC normal Plate: 33</b><br><br>Base Damage = 1-12+25, 17-20/(x3)<br><br>Hit Points: 526<br><br>Perform:18<br>Spellcraft: 43(45)<br>Tumble:40<br>UMD: 28(30)<br>Discipline: 40<br>Lore 8<br>______________<br><br>Fort: <b>34</b>   (45)  {48} &lt;= Implosion Resistant<br>Reflex: <b>27</b> (38)  {41}<br>Will: <b>29</b>   (40)  {43}<br>(x)= spellcraft, Dwarf bonus // {}=spellcraft, Dwarf Bonus, PoA, Bardsong<br><br><i>These saves are very high for not having Monk, CoT, Pally or Blackguard levels anywhere in the build.</i><br>_____________<br>Other Features:<br>Can self buff with Improved Invisibility, Warcry, Bulls Strength, Bard Song, Wounding Whispers<br>Fire &amp; Paralysis Immunity<br>Can cast all spells in Full Plate<br>Blindfighting &amp; Knockdown to take out Spellcasters<br>____________________<br><br>1st: Mage Armor, Protection from Alignment, Cure Light Wounds<br>2nd: Bull's Strength, Invisibiltity, Ultravision, Cure Mod Wounds<br>3rd: Keen Edge, Wounding Whispers, Invis Sphere, Mag Circ against Align<br>4th: Warcry, Improved Invis, Cure Crit<br><br>____________<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/14/07 13:48</span></i></p>

Those saves are spectacular for a build without the classes you mentioned.<br><br>Also, it's refreshing to see a levelling scheme that's not rushing to get those RDD levels as soon as possible and not obsessed with topping Tumble asap as well (something of which I'm guilty).
