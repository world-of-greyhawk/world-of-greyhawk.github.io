Epic Ruin is not a great choice for an epic spell IMO. I'd take EMA or EW. It's pretty much a straight up caster his entire career, except the monk dump. I'd probably go for 10 PM and 2 monk for an earlier dump in discipline and tumble, and ability to use the monk armour. You'd loose 2 point of INT for it. It's nothing new either way though.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

But I think going for 2 monk does not bring you any advantage except that you can use monk skills early. And By picking 10 levels of PM, the character can be immune to critical hit and has much more AC, but the spell cast level of the character is a bit low.

Yes, a rogue level instead of a monk one brings more skill points and a better skill set. But can a rogue wear all monk's gears? Since some monk gears are said to be only available to monk.

He also takes the monk level at level 40, at which point plenty of UMD is there for the taking.

Stated objective "TO NOT HAVE A LOW AC"...  +4 from pm, sure.  Tumble from monk, take it at 37 and leave tumble at 40.

Epic Warding is for those that do get past the AC, though, just reading the wiki now, it seems my mind has fallen in love with the spell from the PRC rules (where you get 50/ caster level (so 35*50=1750) and +20 armor AC (BUT its a lv 10 spell, thus dispelable... in PRC), so im thinking its OK, but not the greatest!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   Yes, avado said it!<br><br>The 12 from wisdom grants +1 ac!!

Yes, maximizing the tumble skill at 40 is right. In fact, I don't want the AC mainly depend on the Dex, and I don't expect this character involved in any melee battle, the AC is for tackling range attack which are not avoidable. By taking rogue, the skill set and AC are better, but if monk, Wis can also contribute to AC.
