yeah but 20 monk 15 cleirc 5 HS would have a way worse ab then 23 paladin 12 monk 5 HS. Also 9 times outta ten you're better off with less than 20 monk levels, okay so immune to mind spells is nice, but other than that you don't get too much from it. Thing about Paladin is there are some nice buffs there. And adding Charisma to saves. Get Extend Spell adn you ahve A Divine favor that lasts a good time. Ab Buffs are:<br><br>Bless +1<br>Aid +1<br>Prayer +1<br>Divine Favor +5<br><br>which is +8 ab. <br><br>Unfortunately if you go unarmed you do loose the Holy sword which is a great spell, and defening clang which is nice, and GMW, but nothign you wouldn't loose by going cleric. Also Cleric leaves you more vulnerable if caught unbuffed, or dispelled. If you go 1-20 Paladin you'd have a 30 bab add +3 from wf and ewf then +1 from epic prowess if you go elf with dex starting dex of 20 +10 from lvls +8 from feats (2 from harper scout bonus feats) is 38 dex. That's +14 to ab. So 30+3+1+14 is 48 ab unbuffed naked with no weapon or anything. Add +5 gloves +12 dex from items, add bless, aid, prayer, and divine favor that's +5 +6 +8 which is 19 on to 48 and you get 67 ab. Only thing about this is with Dex paladin to start off with you don't get uncanny dodge early, your dmg isn't to great in the beginng and you dont get monk to early. Also don't get KD or IKD from monk until epic lvls. But it does give a nice end result <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   (ac is around 36 naked of course adding Items and stat bonuses namely wisdom and Dexterity should give you a fair result.)<br>_________________<br>~I am the wisest man on earth because I know one thing, and that is I know nothing.~<br>-Cairne<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Almalith on 10/22/05 15:41</span></i></p>

While the pally spells are nice, you don't get many castings of them per day. I think with only 15 pally and 14 WIS, you won't even have a casting of the level 4 spells without WIS-boosters. Clercs get their assortment of healing spells, more spellslots and more buffs. They can buff AC too. Both will get dispelled. If you get dispelled, run; You can do that fast enough.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

lvl 15 pally with 14 wis gets 3 1st lvl 3 snd lvl 2 3rd lvl and 1 4th lvl. 23 Paladin on the other hand has 4 1st lvl 4 snd 3 3rd adn 3 4th. Has a higher AB then the cleric and a higher dispell check, and can last longer in batterl without buffs. Only thing a monk/cleric is nice for is if you go wis you have a higer ac, wis/dex will get you a nice ac and lots of spells per day... but bad ab since none of the classes are full ab classes you will rely heavily on buffs, adn without the use of GMW Darkfire or any weapon enhancing stuff you get jipped on that one. And unless you take more than 23 lvls of Cleric the 23 paladin/12 monk/5 hs will have a marginally less ac, much better ab and a higher dispell check.<br><br>But any Dex based chracter without epic dodge, sneak attacks, or Uncanny dodge is a risk to lvl, and a risk in general, even though yout 67 ab coudl KD anyone, and your AC is pretty high your vulnerable to sneak attacks.<br>_________________<br>~I am the wisest man on earth because I know one thing, and that is I know nothing.~<br>-Cairne

Harper scout gets a bonus feat at lvl 1 and lvl 5. Amongst the possible feats Great Dex is one of them Which means that instead of gettign EWF, Epic Prowess, Armour Skin and VI great Dexes, you can get all that and VIII great Dex. So there's a net gain of 1 ac/ab also with tymora's smile you add to your saves, adn varoous other things, also You get invis, eagles splendor and cats grace as spells. And access to tumble without being cheesey and going Rogue. only thing you miss out on is possible 3d6 sneak attacks from 5 rogue lvls.<br>_________________<br>~I am the wisest man on earth because I know one thing, and that is I know nothing.~<br>-Cairne

You need 16 monk to get the full monk unarmed attack damage which is what the guy requested - to be using unarmed. You also need 5 levels for HS. You wouldn't have 23 levels left for pally, just 19 if you did it like that. Pally also gets the save boost from CHA (more on that later) but...<br><br>15 Cleric gets you, from cantrips to level 8 spells: 6/7/7/7/5/5/4/3/2 - provided you invest in 18 WIS. While the base AB mightn't be as high, you'd have more spells to play with like heal, death ward, freedom of movement, magic vestments, etc and with the proper domains, imp invis, cat's grace, stoneskin, haste etc if you wanted so you'd be more versatile than the pally.<br><br>HS gets you Cat's Grace and Eagle's Splendor spell-like abilities, castable once per day which stack with the real spells so you could get your stats up high easily without special EQ.

I suppose it's really dependant on whether you play on a high magic server or low magic server. A server with lots of dispell things the cleric will find itself in trouble either needing to re-cast a lot or spending more time as the healer . Also Paladins get Deathward and Freedom of movement, and only miss out on 2 ab buffs Divine but they make up for that in BaB. Clerics are all well and good until you get dispelled <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> . And anything with decent dispell will dispell a lvl 15 or what not cleric. Also you'd find to compete you'd need AB buffs everytime you enter combat which means less spells slots since they have to be buffs. Which also gets rather annoying. I like clerics, though they are much better when taken post-epic and with a full bab class liek Fighter/Wm/Cleric.<br>_________________<br>~I am the wisest man on earth because I know one thing, and that is I know nothing.~<br>-Cairne
