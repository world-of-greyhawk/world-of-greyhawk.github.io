<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>This is insprired by Syrath's Shadow Archer, except using rogue instead of shadowdancer to pick up Epic Dodge and Self Concealment V.  It loses HIPS and other Shadowdancer niceties (like the summoned shadow), but it gains an 8d6 sneak attack, slightly higher AB, and slightly higher non-sneak damage.  It's a good survivor, although not as good as the Shadow Archer, but it excels in a party situation.<br><br>Elf, any alignment<br><br>STR 10<br>DEX 20 (34)<br>CON 12<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8<br><br>1: Rogue(1) - Point Blank Shot<br>2: Rogue(2)<br>3: Rogue(3) - Rapid Shot<br>4: Rogue(4)<br>5: Rogue(5)<br>6: Rogue(6) - Weapon Focus (Longbow)<br>7: Rogue(7)<br>8: Rogue(8)<br>9: Wizard(1) - Called Shot<br>10: AA(1)<br>11: AA(2)<br>12: AA(3) - Improved Critical (Longbow)<br>13: AA(4)<br>14: AA(5)<br>15: AA(6) - Toughness<br>16: AA(7)<br>17: Wizard(2)<br>18: AA(8) - Dodge<br>19: AA(9)<br>20: AA(10)<br>21: AA(11) - Great Dex I<br>22: Rogue(9)<br>23: Rogue(10) - Improved Evasion<br>24: Rogue(11) - Great Dex II<br>25: Rogue(12)<br>26: AA(12)<br>27: Rogue(13) - Defensive Roll, Epic Dodge<br>28: AA(13)<br>29: AA(14) - Great Dex III<br>30: Rogue(14) - Self Concealment I<br>31: AA(15)<br>32: AA(16)<br>33: Rogue(15) - Self Concealment II<br>34: AA(17)<br>35: AA(18) - Epic Weapon Focus (Longbow)<br>36: AA(19) - Self Concealment III<br>37: AA(20)<br>38: Rogue(16) - Self Concealment IV<br>39: AA(21) - Self Concealment V<br>40: AA(22) - Great Dex IV<br><br>Essential skills: Max Hide and Move Silently on every non-wizard level. Increase tumble in increments of 5 (5, 10, 15, 20) and UMD in increments of 5 (6, 11, 16, 21) on rogue levels, which have been spread out through the build (for the early rogue levels, I would actually take tumble every level, since early on it's useful for the actual tumbling skill rather than just for AC). The rest of the skill points can be altered to taste.<br><br>Naked AB with mundane longbow = 27 (BAB) + 12 (DEX) + 3 (Weapon Focus/Epic Weapon Focus) + 11 (AA levels) = 53/48/43/38 (51/46/41/36/51 with Rapid Shot)<br><br>Naked Damage with mundane longbow = 1d8 + 11 + 8d6 sneak attack (19-20/x2)<br><br>Naked AC = 10 + 12 (DEX) + 8 (tumble) + 1 (dodge) = 31<br><br>You can go Rogue(10)/Wizard(1)/AA(9) pre epic if you want, ending at Rogue(17)/Wizard(1)/AA(22). That will net you an additional 1d6 on your sneak attack, but drop your AB by one (that's actually how I originally had the build before switching it to maximize AB).<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 04/29/09 18:06</span></i></p>

Nice build.<br><br>Overall I like the sneak attack, but without HiPS (or conversely a few more wizard levels to cast invisibility) it is difficult to get ranged attacks of opportunity.  I would suggest dropping called shot and dodge for knockdown and weapon finesse.  It would extend the use of sneak attack in a one on one setting.  Even in a party setting, it might be useful to have a bit of a melee presence if the party is outnumbered.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

While I think it can solo without it, due to Epic Dodge and SC V, I envisioned this more as a party player, sniping over the shoulder of the party's tank.  As for the feat changes, it's my understanding that Dodge is an undocumented prerequisite for Epic Dodge and thus can't be dropped.  But I could possibly drop toughness instead to pick those up.  Weapon Finesse was something I was considering, and I always give my melee rogues Knockdown/Improved Knockdown, but I ended up posting this as a pure archer type instead for now.  But those are definitely changes I would support.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 05/20/05 12:34:17 (GMT) -- MartinJHolm<br><br>I hate this build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br><br>What I mean it's the template for a cornor sneaking archer, the most annoying thing in PvP at least he has no monk speed.<br><br>EDIT: Persnally I would pick bard over wizard since the spellcasting will be useless anyway.

As for bard, yeah, Syrath has it right.  It's all about the XP penalty really.  Plus, Wizard gives you access to true strike.  But if you don't care about those things, you could definitely go with bard.  That would also give you another chance in the teens to bump up UMD and Tumble.<br><br>Steve

Dodge is in the manual listing in the documentation for the game. However technically it is not required.
