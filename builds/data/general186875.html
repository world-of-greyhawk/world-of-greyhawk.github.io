Ok, but in your example, AC was a factor and I'm not sure I find AC to be so worthwhile anymore after my "test". Not to say that AC doesn't play a part but DR seems to have had remarkable results. <br><br>"The hardest fights in games tend to be one on one"<br><br>How so? With three opponents attacking at once, they have 12 attacks/round or so. Plus you miss out on your dex (or dodge) bonus in some cases vs. multiple opponents. They nail you with sheer volume.<br><br><br>"Under the conditions you tested. However under the conditions you tested the STR based fighter with dev crit would beat both the DR and the ED/SC5 in a matter of a few rounds (Dev crit lands regardless of damage done, so it could be damage=0 , fail save)"<br><br>In this test, I wanted to keep it simply focused on pure defense not strong offense being a good defense.<br><br>"Curious to know how you managed to take out a prismatic dragon with only basic items."<br><br>Me too. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  <br><br>Maybe it was a draco-lich. Either way, it had terrible breath and lots of it.<br><br>"To say that you dont use items to cover deficiencies is total rubbish."<br><br>Right you do have items to cover deficiencies. But the DR guy seems to have the fewest deficiencies to cover. I.e. instead of having to wear an AC boosting ring (just a random example) to make up for lack of AC, he can use that spot to pump up his Dex, for instance. I'm talking about the number of deficiencies. For the DR guy, it seems that melee combat is not at all deficient. Didn't lose HP against single powerful opponents or multiple opponents. That doesn't mean that he could take damage but immunity to crits probably means its not much of a problem. <br><br>With spells he has quite a few things taken care of too: SR, High Saves. <br><br>The only thing I could find so far is a lack of elemental damage protection.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Banshe on 03/24/05 12:39</span></i></p>

To have 3 epic level opponents attack an epic level player while they have no equipment is an underbalanced encounter. <br><br>The toughest mobs in HotU for example are Vixthra , Big M etc. These fights are done one on one. <br><br>Any fight I fought in late HotU with a dex build I did easy enough with just epic dodge. The only trouble I had was with Vixthra and M. It is against these mobs and with the very same items I refer to I gauge the success or failure of all of the builds I have tested. I dont try to do these fights with no items at all. This is my "REAL WORLD" test of a build. Not to test it without items against one group of monsters. Then go on and test it with another build then compare the 2. Inevitably one build does better than another in certain playing fields. I just try and vary the fields a little (and yes I test them naked as well, dex builds usually dont fair so well in a straight up fight without parry working)<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

Ok. I have been testing the one-on-one encounters with epic characters in the Novice to Epic Maker Arena choosing lvl 36-40 opponents.<br><br>With all three of these builds, they more or less fared ok, I would say (with the DR guy doing best).<br><br>The defence test that I used specifically here was from a mod I've played a lot on. Its the lizard camp in Nordock. It spawns 40 or so lizard guys. This area was designed for lvl 20 characters. However, unlike the Novice to Epic mod, here I really noticed the difference between the builds. <br><br>There are so many options in character creation that it is hard to tell the difference between builds. This is the first area that I have seen a significant difference in builds.<br><br>If you want me to send you the area erf, pm me your email address.

I had a closer look at the DR guy I was using. It seems he is far more than just a DR guy. <br><br>In his recommended form (risen lord) he has:<br><br>50% dam immune for slash and pierce<br>15/+3 Dam reduct<br><br>Plus the DwD dam reduct and the epic feat dam reduct.<br><br>So I suppose the test was slightly inaccurate as he wasn't just a DR guy...

Well I'm glad my build did so well against a variety of opponents, but in many itemsets it might be a different story. Elemental damage on weapons will be able to hurt him, and quite often since his ac is pretty low, and in PvP: heal spells will kill him unless nerfed, in which case they'll damage him pretty well. You can also use greater restoration (and maybe lesser) to make him unshift, so three castings and he's suddenly quite powerless. (I'm not sure if this is the case on most servers or not. It was on the one I tested him in.) There are a number of clerical spells that also hurt him a great deal, so, basically, clerics can tear him a new one.<br>I'd say that depending on the itemset, syrath's build is probably going to be hit the least. ED/SCV when combined with adequate ac is phenomenal, especially against a single opponent. You need to be wearing equipment though to get adequate ac.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?
