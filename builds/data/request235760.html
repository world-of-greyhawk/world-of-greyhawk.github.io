First a bit about the server<br><br>-ACs can reach past 120, but most people have an AC around 110<br>-Resistances are 50/<br>-no immunities of any kind on gear<br>-you can fit anything you like on gear as long as it doesnt go over level 40<br><br><br>Ok, basically the problem is with the realy high ACs, theres no way to hit anyone except if you roll a 20.<br><br>Alot of people use Monk35/SD5 to duel, since you can put more damage on gloves it seems.<br><br>Anyways, anyone have a thought to a build that can dish out max damage per round?<br><br>Currently I've been playing a Ranger/Ftr/Rogue to get bane of enemies on all the player types, weapon specialization and epic dodge from the rogue. While definatly not the most damage, it can last awhile in combat..<br><br>I was thinking of using the monk, kama/twf exploit to get 10 attacks per round but, I always had very low dmage going that route..<br><br>Any suggestions would be most appreciated.

If you want to pvp, find a new server.  YOu will NEVER be happy if you want to pvp and the ac's are 100+.  See, if the math is correct, the best ab i think you can find is a str horc bard/rdd/wm with a spear.  I think you end on 42 str and get a ab of 51.  +20 cap means you will wiff all day long, cept on 20s.  Add regen to the picture and you can click on the target and go to the pub for a beer.  Come back in 4 hours and if you havent got booted by the server, still no winner!  Am I wrong?   What do I know.  I would never even consider this type of situation, personally!<br><br>Good luck

Since the AC is so high, do not go melee (or ranged for the matter). Implosion, Harm (disregards armor, shield and natural AC), Finger of death, IGMS... just use a form of "attack" that disregards AC and has enough punch to go through resistance or ignores it. Counterspelling exploiting maybe? Unleash a wazoo of IGMS all at once! There's many ways, just don't fight them on their ground.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

I think Kail is right on this one.  The only way I can see to beat those ACs is to not try at all.  My call would be a Cleric or Druid - Harm &amp; Cause Wounds.

How are the magical resistances anyway? a strong caster should beat them, but I wouldn't know.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 04/01/06 19:48</span></i></p>
