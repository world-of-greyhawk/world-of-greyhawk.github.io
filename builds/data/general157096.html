True seeing? Either by scroll, item or spell...

True Seeing is the obvious answer, but from your question, I'm guessing you're playing somewhere with a TS fix.<br><br>Spot and Listen HAVE to be maxed out (that has to be said). You need a high wisdom build, cast TS (which should give you some bonus if TS was given anything at all), Clairvoyance/Clairaudience, and Amplify. So a Cleric with Knowledge domain, a Cleric/Bard, Druid/Bard, Cleric/CoT/Bard, Druid/Shifter/Bard, that kind of thing.<br><br>Short of being immune: sneak attack, that's the idea behind catching them out.<br><br>There's an exploit to catching HiPS characters that is totally unfair to use, because it ruins things for people who don't overabuse it. That's Knockdown - you'll target them even after they are in stealth, and is actually cheating, whereas HiPS spamming is not.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Avendesora84 on 10/04/04 15:44</span></i></p>

If your an epic spell caster, getting Epic Spell Dragonknight is an option. The dragon has undispellable trueseeing and immunity to sneaks.

TS while an option is mainly on one day a use items and taking the time to change your helm will normally see your death.  Most of the PvP on this server is at L40, while you start at L3 the top end combat vs NPCs you almost have to be L40 to survive.  It is a LOtR sever so of course you have good and evil and they will protect there forts or areas.<br><br>My experence is Blind Fighting is doing nothing to help me from getting flank and the bonus put on (or my AC droped) my player.<br><br>In my tests spot or hearing is nearly useless unless your a cleric or monk as the SD will have huge Dex and normally be out of your roll range for a skill check.<br><br>Interesting idea on the Dragon Knight!<br><br>Knockdown while an explote seams interesting, but more then likely not a great idea as the -4 to ab (unless IKD) combined with epic dodge means alot of miss's.

I vaguely remember something about normally being able to find traps or a hidden enemy within a range of 5', which doubles to 10' when you enable Detect mode.  Since Elves have the Keen Senses feat, which just has the effect of Detect mode being on constantly, they don't move any slower, which is an advantage.<br><br>I'm not at all certain about what I said here, it's just a (very) vague memory <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br><i>"Destiny, chance, fate, fortune, they're all just ways of claiming your successes without admitting your defeats."</i><br>   --<i>Gerrard of the</i> Weatherlight

One of the RP groups I have on my PW is a halfling rogue gang (all 40th level). My char in this group has maxed Spot and Listen, yet can never see the others when they HIPS. I'm presuming this is because Stealth mode has a dex modifier where as spot has uses int.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Zyn248 on 10/06/04 05:34</span></i></p>
