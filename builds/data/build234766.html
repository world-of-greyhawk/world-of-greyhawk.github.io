I heard that this level combination was very effective in combat as due to Pale Master levels you can have high AC and Critical/Sneak Immunity, combined with very useful Cleric spells to boost your offensive capability.<br><br>That said I went out and build my own version of what seems a popular build, in fact a quick search reveals 4:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "213833", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> I have only given link to I...Sampus's build as he has a link to the other three!!!<br><br>Not sure about playability through the levels, but should do alright, mainly aimed for <b>PvP</b> but there is no reason why it shouldn't also shine in <b>PvM</b><br><br><b>Another Lite-Can Cleric!</b><br><b>cleric 20 / bard 4 / pale master 16</b><br><b>Playable 1-40 PvP &amp; PvM</b><br><br><b>ABILITIES :</b><br><br>Starting Statistics <b>final stats</b><br><br>Str - 16 <b>24</b><br>Dex - 8 <b>8</b><br>Con - 12 <b>12</b><br>Wis - 16 <b>19</b><br>Int - 14 <b>14</b><br>Cha - 8 <b>8</b><br><br><b>LEVELLING GUIDE :</b><br><br>01: Cleric(1): <b>toughness</b>, <b>blind fight</b>, <b>domain trickery</b>, <b>domain magic</b><br>02: Cleric(2):<br>03: Cleric(3): <b>weapon focus</b>*<br>04: Cleric(4): <b>WIS+1</b>, <i>WIS=17</i><br>05: Cleric(5):<br>06: Cleric(6): <b>skill focus: discipline</b><br>07: Cleric(7):<br>08: Cleric(8): <b>WIS+1</b>, <i>WIS=18</i><br>09: Cleric(9): <b>combat casting</b><br>10: Cleric(10):<br>11: Cleric(11):<br>12: Cleric(12): <b>WIS+1</b>, <b>extend spell</b>, <i>WIS=19</i><br>13: Cleric(13):<br>14: Cleric(14):<br>15: Cleric(15): <b>knockdown</b><br>16: Cleric(16): <b>STR+1</b>, <i>STR=17</i><br>17: Cleric(17):<br>18: Cleric(18): <b>improved knockdown</b><br>19: Cleric(19):<br>20: Cleric(20): <b>STR+1</b>, <i>STR=18</i><br>21: Bard(1): <b>epic weapon focus</b><br>22: Bard(2):<br>23: Bard(3):<br>24: Pale Master(1): <b>STR+1</b>, <b>improved combat casting</b>, <i>STR=19</i><br>25: Pale Master(2):<br>26: Pale Master(3):<br>27: Pale Master(4): <b>epic prowess</b><br>28: Pale Master(5): <b>STR+1</b>, <i>STR=20</i><br>29: Pale Master(6):<br>30: Pale Master(7): <b>armor skin</b><br>31: Pale Master(8):<br>32: Pale Master(9): <b>STR+1</b>, <i>STR=21</i><br>33: Pale Master(10): <b>epic skill focus: discipline</b><br>34: Pale Master(11):<br>35: Pale Master(12):<br>36: Pale Master(13): <b>STR+1</b>, <b>epic energy resistance: acid I &amp; II</b>**, <i>STR=22</i><br>37: Pale Master(14)<br>38: Pale Master(15)<br>39: Pale Master(16): <b>great strength I</b>, <b>epic spell: epic mage armor</b>, <i>STR=23</i><br>40: Bard(4): <b>STR+1</b>, <i>STR=24</i><br><br><br>*for the purposes of this build I use a mace <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   however any simple weapon would suffice, or martial/exotic if you were willing to sacrifice <b>toughness</b> or <b>IKD</b> for either weapon proficiency feat.<br><br>**one of the epic energy resistances is taken as your bonus Pale Master feat, with the second as a regular epic feat.

I'd drop CC/ICC for empower spell and Great WIS. You can cast in defensive casting mode to avoid AoO. <br><br>I'd get the metamagic feat in a little earlier and probably drop SF: discipline for IC.<br><br> War domain would give you Cat's Grace and AoV which are great spells for buffing, Mage Armor is no big deal since dodge AC is the only one stacking. Stoneskin and Icestorm are what I choose the magic domain for usually (plus Melf's Acid arrow at lower lvls).<br><br>ESF: discipline and the energy resistances are good choices for PvP, that plus the various protection from the elements spells should give you the protection you need from those nasty shields.<br><br>Epic Warding might be a better choice if +5 items are easily available.<br><br>PS: you forgot the base unbuffed AB and AC<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Wait for me Dragon, we'll meet in the sky<br>By fire and magic, I'm sworn<br>Hell is calling, we cannot be denied<br>Fly to the blackness of the Storm<br><br>We must die to be reborn!

I agree with Kail on all his points.<br><br>Not sure if you read the adjusted final version of the Priestess of the Damned, the reason being that Dev Crit and all its pre-reqs were dropped.<br><br>Some comments:<br><br>Take<br>-Raise Wisdom to 20 as it gives you an extra 1st and 5th level spell and 1 point to Will Save and Cleric Spell DCs.<br>-Epic Warding? Drop an Epic Acid Res at 36th for a Great Strength and then take Epic Warding at 39th.<br>-Maybe swap Heal Ranks for Taunt to give you the chance of another 6 AB in melee, and 30% spellcasting failure if successful<br>-Skill Focus Discipline - Dropping this would still give you 60 points in DIS (unbuffed), I would consider replacing with Silent Spell or Imp Crit. I agree keep the ESF: Discipline<br>-Magic Domain? - your Spell Penetration is very low, despite Melf's Acid Arrow and Ice Storm having no save. Their effectiveness, particularly at higher levels may be reduced. Although the benefit from Stoneskin is useful, see Kail's comment about Mage Armor.<br>-Your 68 AC will only last 20 rounds before dropping back to 60. Undeath's Eternal Foe can't be Extended as it is a 9th level spell. You will find this can get very frustrating. <br>-Studded Leather Armor and Small Shield? WHY? You are a Divine Caster, able to cast in Heavy Armor and with a Tower Shield without spell failure.... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  . You have no Uncanny Dodge, so any bonus to your DEX (ie. taking it above 13 points will be lost if flatfooted immediately).<br><br>Overall differences:<br><br>Lite-Can Cleric<br>HP +27 points<br>Discipline +13 points higher<br>Fort +1 higher<br>Reflex +1 higher<br>Acid Damage Reduction 10/ extra<br>Improved Invisibility<br>Rogue skills (low duration when using Domain Ability)<br>Extra +1 save against Spells (Spellcraft)<br><br>Priestess of Damned<br>Taunt 44<br>Will +1 higher<br>Epic Warding<br>Aura of Vitality (not included in capped AB calc. - this is Extendable to 40 rounds and party benefit)<br>Battle Mastery (not included in capped AB calc)<br>AC 70 (80 with 3 Undeaths eternal Foe casts)<br>Extra 1st and 5th level cleric spell<br>Travel Domain swapped out for Trickery in PWs with perma Haste - no difference really.<br>Melee Weapon Crit Range 15-20/ x2 (unbuffed and non-magical)<br>Able to use all Martial Weapons<br><br>AB Calc fully buffed <br><br>25 base<br>13 from str (36 str with +12 from items/buffs)<br>3 epic weapon focus<br>1 epic prowess<br>5 divine power<br>5 divine favor<br>2 battletide<br>1 bless<br>1 aid<br>1 prayer<br>5 greater magic weapon<br>--------<br>+62/+57/+52/+62/+62 (attacks with divine power and haste)<br><br>battle mastery and bard song will boost ab, but since it already hits the +20 cap, it won't add anything else.<br>Damage and other goodies from those abilities are still nice though.<br><br>In combat tests in the Novice to Epic Mod, this really does not need any more equipment apart from Full Plate, Tower Shield and a melee weapon (all mundane), with the exception of an Amulet of Natural Armor and Dodge Bonus AC. <br>In worlds where +5 and higher equipment is readily available then I would seriously consider dropping PM levels to 10 and taking a further 6 in Cleric. You gain 2 epic Cleric Feats, undispellable buffs unless MD'd, improved Spell Penetration, improved bonus to Battle Mastery Domain ability, longer duration of all spells cast. Sadly you would lose Epic Warding.<br><br>Feedback - hopefully, some of it may be useful.

I've seen these builds floating around a bit... I don't quite get them.  You don't add spells to bard with palemaster, right?  So you're using PM for AC, immunity to crits, and epic arcane spells.  Is that about the size if it?

K, I know that up until now, we could all make pms with 3 class lvls of an arcane class!  It seems that this has changed.  We now have to have 3rd lvl spells  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">   Can anyone else verify or disprove this statement?   This means that all our lovely cleric bard pms must be changed!!!   *tears*

Are you using 1.66 or 1.67 ???<br><br>I have not updated anything and am having no problem making PMs with 3 levels of wiz/bard/sorc!<br><br>This could be a new implementation...or maybe just on the servers you are playing!

It's not quite what I meant.  I have always had no troubles at all using the 3bard qualifier, but when a question was asked in another older build recently, pm would not open for me at wiz3!  I am no slouch at building, and it would not open!  It wouldnt open until lv 5, that means 3rd lv spells!  I am not sure why this is, but it occured!  I am not sure what patch i have, though i do play online exclusively, cept for the lvler i use to test builds, which has not changed!   I will check again tonight.<br><br>Thanks
