Probably best to go fighter10/Wiz1/Arcane Archer29 , elf or half elf. These guys are the best archers in the game. Dealing 1d8+21 with a standard longbow. Another build would be to utilise sneak attack ie Fighter 5/ Rogue 35 for something like 1d8 +6(normal) with 18d6 sneak damage for a succesful sneak, reduced to 17d6 if you take the cheesy 1 level of shadowdancer. Other alternatives could be the Cleric zen archer that uses buffs to increase damage. <br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!
