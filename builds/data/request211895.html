I am trying to play a half-orc barbarian on a low level, low magic server. Generally, PrCs are restricted unless you petition a DM, and the server is pretty much capped around level 20-25. My build so far looks something like this:<br><br>Half-Orc<br>Chaotic Evil<br>Str: 20 (All points go here)<br>Dex: 12<br>Con: 16<br>Wis: 8<br>Int: 6<br><br>Barbarian 16/Fighter 4 (Don't really plan to get over 20, as I don't think anyone on the server ever has managed to. If I do I will probably just add dev crit or something)<br><br>Feats: Power Attack, Cleave, Toughness, Weapon Focus Greataxe, Weapon Spec Greataxe, Improved Critical, Knockdown, Improved Power Attack, and maybe something like blindfight. <br><br>Anyways, I was planning to allocate my skills in both Discipline and Taunt. However, I noticed that whenever I took a fighter level I would only get 1 skill to allocate as opposed to two when I was taking barbarian levels. As a result, I believe I will only be able to get around 19 taunt by level 20. Is it still worth taking taunt at all, or is this build just plain awful? If it is the latter, is there a better low to mid level melee-type half-orc build, such as barb/rogue or maybe as a fighter?

Friend, you are lucky to get 1 skill point!   6 int isnt much, infact, it gives a -2 to int rolls, hence ftrs get 2 per lvl - 2 = 0 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">   so consider the 1 a gift!  LOL  jk<br><br>Taunt is great for lowrin ac, hence increasing AB.  Discipline for resistin things like KD.  What does this character need more?  All in all it is a solid barbarian build.

Yeah, your INT is modifying your skill point awards down by 2 per level. Your FTR levels only get two, which would be a net of zero. However, you always get at least 1 skill point per level, no matter what, so that's why you get one. (As Avado said, you should consider it a gift!). Personally, I don't like min/maxing to the detriment of INT, so I'd probably have started with 18 STR and 12 INT. Just my preference though. Your build should be pretty solid as is.<br><br>Anyhow, if you're planning on using Taunt against mainly melee opponents and not caster types, then it would probably be worth the investment, as most meleers don't bother putting points in Concentration.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Alright, I have another question. My server has a lvl cap at 12 or so that you can get past only by roleplaying and etc. So my idea was to try and get most of the essential feats by then. Now, I managed to get most of the feats I mentioned above by level 12 (done by going 8 barb 4 fighter), but I am not sure about what I should put in my 12th feat slot. By level 12 I would have: Power Attack, Cleave, Toughness, Weapon Focus Greataxe, Weapon Spec Greataxe, Improved Critical and Knockdown. I would have 1 feat left to choose from. Now I think most of the useful ones (the ones that I thought I should probably get by 20) would be Great Cleave, Improved Power Attack, and Blindfight. I just wanted to know which of these would be most useful to take at 12th level and maybe the order from most useful to least useful. Or if I should get something else.

My thought would be:<br><br>1) Blind Fight<br>2) Called Shot<br>3) Skill Focus:Taunt or Great Cleave<br><br>But that's just me.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

I though Imp Power attack was really good? Or maybe it reduces my AB too much I guess? Never really considered called shot though, I always kind of assumed it wasn't worth taking.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By OMGZERGRUSHWTF on 10/20/05 06:22</span></i></p>

What about Iron Will? Wouldn't Iron Will be more useful than Imp Power attack?

Blind Fight if there are a lot of mages you wanna hit or ghosts. I HATE concealed spirits/undead things. Otherwise, do what Cin said. Imp. Power attack is near-useless since, as you probably already figured, it reduces your AB too much. Good for bashing chests open even better though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

Maybe I should get weapon prof exotic and then scythe focuses instead.. Would do ridiculous amounts of damage on criticals. Not sure if taunt is worth taking over heal though. Heal is pretty important on my server b/c of no resting outside of cities and the fact that it was buffed somewhat.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By OMGZERGRUSHWTF on 10/24/05 05:30</span></i></p>

Having spare points heal can be a good investment. The use of healing kits in combat, in fact, doesn't provoke any AoO and with a good score in heal it becomes as powerful as a cure critical wounds potion. If I'm not mistaken (or if they haven't changed it in recent patches) you can even use a healing kit in stealth mode and stay stealthy.<br>It's actually quite unrealistic already the fact that you can use bandages and scalpels to patch yourself up while in the midst of combat, having this operation NOT provoking AoO is practically ridiculous, but that's the way it works<br>Summing up, if you can spare the points Heal is not a bad choice IMO<br>Cheers

Yeah I am probably going to be capped at level 12 or 13 with this build. Does anyone have a better idea of how to build low level half-orcs? I know they are generally considered the worst race... If I was capped at lvl 12, would a rogue4/fighter4/barb5 be better than a pure barb/4fighter? I would think that the rogue one would have less hitpoints and Ab though. And maybe if I went barb/fighter should I take 2 points out of dex to boost intelligence to 8 so I can max out taunt and get some points in heal or something?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By OMGZERGRUSHWTF on 11/06/05 19:02</span></i></p>
