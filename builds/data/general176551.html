A friend of mine is currently trying to decide how to go about building this themed character.<br><br>Fafnir was a dwarf in norse mythology that got a lot of gold and ended up being changed into a dragon. Of course that is the short snipped story.<br><br>Anyway here are the requirements that he has set forth:<br><br>1.) It have the following classes: Druid, DwD, and Monk<br><br>2.) of course it must be a dwarf<br><br>3.) It get epic druid spells ruin, hellball, and dragon shape<br><br>4.) He wants zen archery in the mix.<br><br>I have been looking at a 27 druid, 10 Dwd, and 3 monk combo, but the build seems awfully weak when I attempt it. I was hoping that someone here could help me out.<br><br>Thanks,<br>-Pendragon

Ok, I've got a build for you.  I haven't tried it yet, so let me know whether or not it works.  <br><br>Note that if you wanted to you could go Monk 2/Druid 24/DwD 10 and take a Damage Resistance feat in order to get up to 12/- DR, but since Ancient Dragons get something like 40/- DR anyway, I figured it would be a whole lot more useful to get Improved Knockdown (Monk level 6) and get a huge bonus to your AB.  <br><br>Fafnir the Dwarf<br><br>Monk 6/Druid 24/DwD 10<br>(pre-epic Monk 4/Druid 8/Monk DwD <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"> <br><br>Race: Dwarf<br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 13<br>Con 16<br>Int 12 <br>Wis 17<br>Cha 6<br><br>9 points into Wis, last point into Dex<br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 14<br>Con 16<br>Int 14 <br>Wis 30<br>Cha 6<br><br>1 Point Blank Shot <br>3 Zen Archery<br>6 Weapon Focus<br>9 Toughness  <br>12 Dodge<br>15 Extend Spell (or Empower Spell)<br>18 Rapid Shot (or Rapid Reload)<br>21 Epic Weapon Focus<br>24 Great Wis I<br>27 Great Wis II<br>30 Great Wis III<br>33 Great Wis IV<br>36 Greater Ruin<br>39 Hellball, Druid: Dragon Shape <br><br>Epic lvl progression:<br><br>21-22 DwD<br>23-29 Druid<br>30    Monk<br>31-39 Druid <br>40    Monk<br><br>Skills:  <br><br>Concentration: 43<br>Discipline: 43<br>Healing: 36<br>Spellcraft: 40 <br>Tumble:  40<br><br>Total: 195 skill credits

May i remind you that IKD does not give additionel AB any longer. size increases the Disc roll instead. always -4 AB even when you use IKD nowadays.
