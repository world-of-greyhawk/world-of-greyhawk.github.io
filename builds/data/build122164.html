This is my first custom build. Let me know what u think.<br><br>Title: Fierce Archer Spellcaster<br><br>The idea here is to make a fierce ranged-attack character, capable of both strong magic and archery attacks and also able to wear armor. The cleric gains power to his abilities by increasing Wisdom. So by using Zen Archery feat, that Wisdom supplementation can also be harnessed for power for archery shots. This makes a completely non-Dex archer, allowing full focus on Wisdom ability upgrades only. This also allows the archer to wear strong armor, because of no Dex modification limitation. Some other mixed-abilities builds may suffer from the need to add different abilities, but this character may add Wisdom for both aspects of the build.<br><br>The epic Cleric side of the character allows for extensive buffs and other handy magic spells. The epic Arcane Archer can provide a fierce physical ranged offense, further aided by the Owl’s Wisdom buff and others. The cleric leveling positions are coordinated as such to incorporate 3 epic cleric spells: Greater Ruin, Hellball (powerful ranged magic attack), and Mummy (to serve as a tank for the ranged attack). The character also receives a familiar when adding the one Wizard level needed for adding Arcane Archer.<br><br>When unavoidable melee occurs, shield and sword quickslots may be equipped, quickly changing the tactic style. Then this character may offer a pretty decent defensive front, launching magic attacks or sword damage until an opportunity to move back again for ranged attacks.<br><br>While leveling:<br>- For every Cleric and Wiz level, max out concentration and spellcrafting when possible. Mummy needs spellcraft of 15, Greater Ruin needs spellcraft of 25, and Hellball needs spellcraft of 32.<br>- Start off with max Wisdom (18) and Constitution (15) abilities.<br><br>---Final---<br>Race: Elf<br>Alignment: Neutral<br>Type: Wiz: 1, A.Archer: 15 ,Cleric: 24<br>32 Wisdom<br>16 Constitution<br><br>Lvl Type Feats Abilities<br>1 Cleric Toughness<br>2 Cleric<br>3 Cleric Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>4 Cleric Wisdom +<br>5 Cleric<br>6 Cleric Spell Penetration<br>7 Cleric<br>8 Cleric Wisdom +<br>9 Cleric Maximize Spell<br>10 Cleric<br>11 Cleric<br>12 Cleric Empower Spell Wisdom +<br>13 Cleric<br>14 Cleric<br>15 Cleric Zen Archery<br>16 Cleric Wisdom +<br>17 Cleric<br>18 Cleric Point Blank Shot<br>19 Cleric<br>20 Cleric Wisdom +<br>21 Cleric Mummy<br>22 Wizard<br>23 A.
