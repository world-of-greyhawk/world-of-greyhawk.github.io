I need a little help guys.  I am pretty horrible at build making, and I know that if anyone can fix this for me, you can <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .<br><br>I play on a very low-magic server.  I was told that +1 items will be really rare, and extra properties like "Keen" almost non-existant.  Why play on something so low-powered you ask?  Becuase I have played with the same group of RPers for a long time.  We're just now moving from UO to NwN, the module is set to open on the 16th, so that gives me a week to work on my build.<br><br>Given that extremely low-magic setting, I've decided a Monk class would be pretty good for me.  It's an RP server, and I have always been a fan of Kung Fu movies.  My biggest threat in the way of PvP would be HIPS rogues, since HIPS is allowed on the server.<br><br>I found a PRC Prestige Class that gives Immunity to Sneak Attacks as well as a few other things, the icing on that cake is it stacks with Monk levels for damage.  So I have two of my classes: Monk and Henshin Mystic.<br><br>Now I just need a third class.  Hopefully one with good attack bonus OR special abilities that will put me ahead of the game, so to speak.<br><br>Also, I'm still debating on being strength or dex based, and using Kamas or Fists... thoughts on that would be very helpful <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .<br><br>Think you guys can help me?

Are Shifters un-modified?  If they are not changed, then become a Shifter and you will dominate the server.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Dr/Shifter/Monk would net you so many benefits on a LOW magic server that you'd be overpowered in hand to hand combat compared to your counterparts.<br><br>Many shapes have natural DR, not to mention the built in +3 or +5 weapons!

Well, the only problem with that is I would be expected to RP my classes... And I could care less about the forest <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   If it weren't for that, I would definatly set myself up like that.<br><br>So I'm trying to work more with Monk Prestige classes, like the Initiate of Draconic Mysteries, but I heard it's buggy..

One other class I was looking at was the Soulknife, but being a PRC class I couldn't find any builds for it.  Are there any good ones?

You could probably get better responses at the PRC forums. Unfortunately I can't link you since I have no idea but I'm sure you can find your way there by yourself <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a>
