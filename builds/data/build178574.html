After looking for quite a while through the lists, I did not see another one of these.  If I missed one, I apologize.  The list HAS gotten rather long and all.  Onward<br><br>I wanted to do a dual wielding character that had both devastaing critical and improved whirlwind attack. I did not want to be an RDD. This meant getting the 25 str, 23 dex, and 13 int required would put stats at a premium. Since Halforcs take an int penalty and halflings take a str penalty, I decided that an elf was my best bet. Since the prereqs for improved whirlwind are most of the prereqs for weapon master, I decided that I would be a weapon master. Since my goal is lots of critical hits, I decided to wield either a scimitar, rapier, or kukri. Since my Str was going to top out at 26 (dex at 24), I went with kukri because I did not want to lose the 2 AB I would dual wielding others. If possible, I wanted to get my tumble to 40 (and, maybe, UMD to 31 for a specific item on the PW I play at) and uncanny dodge without taking xp penalties. Finally, I decided that I wanted Dev crit first, since I wanted the str for my AB.

I should really sit down and try to figure if it is possible with a human or dwarven rogue without takin CON below 10. I think it might be, but you may end up with odd stats in either STR or DEX (or both). I try to avoid that if at all possible. For another day I suppose.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Yar Stardawg on 02/01/05 18:55</span></i></p>

Why was assassin chosen instead of say rogue or shadowdancer?<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Rogue-I play on a PW which means I lvl up my characters the hard way.  If I did rogue, I would have an XP penalty from lvl 22 on.  I try to never make a build with an XP penalty.  That is just one of my personal rules.  If there was no XP penalty, I would choose rogue first.<br><br>Shadowdancer-As I think I said, I would have to spend 14 more skill points cross classed to qualify  (10 for a 5 tumble, 4 for the 10 hide...or is it move silent)  Assassin only need 8 hide and 8 move silent.

personally, I'd choose shadowdancer instead of assasin.  sure, you'll have to spend more skill points to qualify, but I think it is worth it just for the evasion feat.  You'll have a high reflex save due to your dex and weapon master levels so you'll make good use of evasion.<br><br>You give up 2d6 sneak attack by not taking assassin, not too much to lose.  <br><br>Both classes get uncanny dodge, so either way you won't be losing your dex bonus to ac when flatfooted.

I would lose the UMD though.  Depends on the world and what is available.

GRRR.  I just went through this trying to do it with a human and dwarf with rogue when I realized I totally forgot Expertise.  It can still be done, I will just have to rejigger the feats around and possibly drop some WM lvls for fighter.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.rpgmods.net/forgottenworlds/phpBB2/" target="_blank">Click Here</a>
