<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>Grishnak licked the blood from his curved dagger as he dropped the body of the guard whose throat he had just slit. He watched with curious amusement as blood spurted from carotid artery of the still twitching corpse. The warmth of the blood was a pleasing contrast to the cold river water from which he had just emerged. It had been unpleasant, but it was the easiest way to enter the village. He and his fellow orcs had felled a pair of trees, pushed them into the river. All they had to do then was hide in their branches as the current brought them past the earthworks and guards at the outskirts of the village and into its very core. There were only two guards in the core of the village. Two of his eight comrades fell on one of them, drawing the attention of the other. This had given Grishnak the chance to ambush the other one he was watching now. He looked around the village, their attack had gone unnoticed, the few meager houses bore silent witness to the horror that had just unfolded. He could only hear the rushing of the water from the river that bisected the town. His comrades grinned at him eagerly, there would be good hunting tonight.<br><br>His own countenance suddenly changed from one of glee to one of horror as Shima, their Shaman, fell to the ground clutching the bolt that now pierced his throat. Grishnak and his comrades spun about, seeking cover and desperately trying to find their new assailant. During the ensuing chaos two more of Grishnak’s party fell to the unknown warrior. It was Krimul who spotted the hunched figure first. The figure was lurking in a small thicket of uncleared brush, he had several bolts lodged in the ground before him and had already reloaded his crossbow. Before Grishnak could stop him, Krimul went running after his assailant, he went two steps before the marksman rose and buried a bolt in his lungs. Krimul lay there on the ground gurgling blood, enraged Grishnak drew his axe and ordered his remaining men forward.<br><br>As they raced to the thicket, the marksman dropped to one knee, as he did he hooked the bowstring about his knee letting his weight *** the weapon. As he knelt he drew a bolt from the ground and notched it. Grishnak threw himself to the ground, but he was not the target. Votgar, Grishnak’s Lieutenant, turned and took the bolt in his arm. It barely slowed the large muscular orc, instead Votgar lunged forward with even more speed. The marksman dropped his weapon and stepped back into the cover of the thicket. As Votgar reached the thicket his foot caught a trip wire. A branch covered with daggers sprang out, thrusting several of the blades into Votgar’s back.<br><br>Grishnak and his three companions rushed forward. The marksman reemerged with a claymore and cut down one of Grishnak’s companions. Grishnak motioned his two comrades to move out and flank the marksman. The marksman swung his sword is broad motions using its length as a shield. As Grishnak moved in, he saw a shadow from the corner of his eye, and stepped back. A large panther leapt out of the shadows and tackled one Grishnak’s companions. Grishnak cringed at the sound of crunching bone as cat snapped his companions neck. The marksman brought his sword down hard against the scimitar of Grishnak’s last ally. He forced the orc’s blade against the latter’s body. With a deft motion the marksman stepped back, letting his blade slide down and he then thrust forward letting the blade slide under the orc’s gorget and into his gullet. The marksman whistled and the panther withdrew, Leaving Grishnak with the marksman. Grishnak swung out with his axe, using it as a hook to grasp the sword. The Marksman turned it aside stepping back and out of Grishnak’s range. Grishnak rushed forward trying to press his advantage he locked his axe against the marksman’s blade and stepped in, to finish him with his dagger. The marksman pivoted, however, planting his foot against the root of a tree and pushing off. The sudden thrust threw Grishnak off balance, as he stumbled the marksman’s sword came around again severing Grishnak’s axe arm. As Grishnak tumbled to the ground he looked up, just in time to see the Marksman’s blade speeding towards his neck.<br><br>If dev. crit. for ranged weapons is going to be implemented, I figured I'd beat the rush and post a character that makes use of it.<br><br>The Lone Ranger (Hey, Somebody had to use it)<br><br>Race Human (Subrace Aasimar)<br><br>Alignment Any<br><br>Base Attributes<br>STR 16<br>DEX 10<br>CON 10<br>INT 14<br>WIS 16<br>CHA 8<br><br>Leveling Guide<br>Level 1 Ranger<br>Levels 2-11 Fighter<br>Levels 12-30 Ranger<br>Levels 31-32 Rogue<br>Levels 33-38 Fighter<br>Level 39 Ranger<br>Level 40 Rogue<br><br>Attribute Bonuses<br>All 10 go to Strength<br><br>Feat Selection<br>Level 1: Weapon Focus (Heavy Crossbow), Weapon Focus (Greatsword), Favoured Enemy (Undead)<br>Level 2: Zen Archery<br>Level 3: Point Blank Shot, Rapid Reload<br>Level 5: Weapon Specialization (Heavy Crossbow)<br>Level 6: Weapon Specialization (Greatsword)<br>Level 7: Zen Archery<br>Level 9: Cleave, Great Cleave<br>Level 11: Improved Critical (Greatsword)<br>Level 12: Improved Critical (Heavy Crossbow)<br>Level 15: Knockdown, Favoured Enemy (Outsider)<br>Level 18: Improved Knockdown<br>Level 20: Favoured Enemy (Construct)<br>Level 21: Epic Weapon Focus (Greatsword)<br>Level 24: Epic Weapon Focus (Heavy Crossbow)<br>Level 25: Favoured Enemy (Dragon)<br>Level 27: Epic Prowess<br>Level 30: Overwhelming Critical (Greatsword), Favoured Enemy (Dwarf)<br>Level 33: Overwhelming Critical (Heavy Crossbow)<br>Level 34: Epic Weapon Specialization (Greatsword)<br>Level 36: Devastating Critical (Greatsword), Devastating Critical (Heavy Crossbow)<br>Level 38: Epic Weapon Specialization (Heavy Crossbow)<br>Level 39: Bane of Enemies<br><br>Final Attributes<br>STR 26<br>DEX 10<br>CON 10<br>INT 14<br>WIS 16<br>CHA 8<br><br>Skill Points: 281<br>Discipline 42<br>Hide 43<br>Move Silently 43<br>Set Trap 30<br>Spellcraft 20<br>Tumble 40<br>Use Magic Device 43<br><br>AB and Damage<br><br>(Mighty +8 heavy crossbow, no buffs)<br>37/32/27/22 14+1D10 (17-20 x2)<br>39/34/29/24 19+2D6+1D10 (17-20 x2) (Vs.
