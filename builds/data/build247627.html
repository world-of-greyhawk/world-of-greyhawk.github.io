Great work. i like to spellsword sometimes meself. I love the fact that CoT gets autostill as bonus feats, but this char gets autostill a bit late, no? When I saw your level-split I was sure that you had picked Auto still earlier. A pain with lvl 9 spells rule though.<br><br>Okay AB, moreso for a spellsword, full spell repertoire, decent saves. all this should give you a versatile and powerful eneough build. Only thing i would strive for is earlier autostill. But then you'd belate other abilities/feats, so it's as usual, choice choices.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

I would suggest tweaking, but it looks like you already got what you wanted when you wanted it.  <br><br>I love a good spellsword but have yet to create one that I was truly satisfied with.  Perhaps it is just my playstyle though.<br><br>On that note, in what way do you find (in general) that you handle situations?  Buff up, charge in and pull out a Greater Sanc if you are overwhelmed?  Or is there another way to do it with this sort of build?  I usually find that I get hammered far too often and my spells cannot compensate.  I can try to soften enemies with offensive spells a bit, but its never enough for my liking.

Grimnir: yeah, the Autostills are late. Price I was willing to pay to get other feats earlier. As well, you can Still all spells up to level 9 before that (and some of the good level 9 spells are verbal only anyway).<br><br>Christian:<br><br>I generally play it in this manner: buff, then lay out AoE spells that will provide annoyances to the enemy (grease, web, Darkness, etc.) between me and them (try to get that done without engaging) Then try to hit them with a couple offensive spells to soften them up. If they get slowed or caught in your 'annoyance' field, then hit them with some more spells. Engage them with weapons when they close. Don't forgety Extended reciprocal damage shields.<br><br>This works suprisingly well even with the low DC and caster levels (and with the 1.67 version of Evard's, you should be able to really make some of the mobs' lives miserable).<br><br>If things look bad, Greater Sanc and retreat.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...

Post a build like this and you know I have to comment.  I like it.  It's well made, like all of Cin's builds.  It's a shame you couldn't fit an epic spell in there, but it still works well.  It's also unfortunate that you can't get the autostills earlier.  I guess this is the problem with spellswords, particularly armored ones, you really need 40 levels to get them to work and they don't really mature until level 40.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

I like spellswords too, and this is one of the better ones. However, since you have feats like Power Attack and Cleave, you obviously have feats to spare. This is why I'd take a few less Ftr levels and more Wiz in order to get at least Epic Warding. Sure, PA &amp; Cleave make it more playable early on but frankly, EW is one of the best things about arcane casters IMO.<br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a>

I'm not a big fan of the epic spells, to be honest. Even Epic Warding. It's only one use per day, it doesn't stop elemental damages or Dev Crit, and if I'm in a battle where I absolutely <i>need</i> EW to survive, I'd probably just GS, run and regroup. It's a good feat, but I personally don't feel the investment is of paramount importance.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...

They are similar in some respects, but the spellsword has better damage reduction, damage shields and spells like the bigby's hands, IGMS and timestop which don't require high DCs to ruin an opponent's day.  Basically the cleric is a better buffer, while the spellsword is a better offensive caster.  Both can be lethal in the hands of a skilled player.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
