I definitely like this one much better...and it's much more <b>playable from Lvl 1 to 40.</b>  Designed for <b>PvM.</b>  I incorporated the advice of the board vets to generate what I think is now a pretty solid, self-reliant build. <br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "207678", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Original Build</a><br>My original goals:<br><br>1) To obtain max-dual wielding # of attacks <br>2) To require little or no magical equipment <br>3) To take the best advantage of the synergy of monk abilities (attacks, imp ev., etc), cleric AB buffs, and dwarven defender DR. My hope was that this would generate a fun to play, well-balanced character (this, ultimately, failed to generate a strong build, so hopefully this version redeems the previous one somewhat).<br><br>The second version below substitutes CoT for DwD (thanks to grizzled dwarflord for that suggestion)...and I think it's much more potent overall:<br><br>Strengths:<br><br>1) Solid buffed AB.<br>2) Maximum monk attack schedule (8 attacks, 9 with flurry, 10 with haste)<br>3) 9/- DR. <br>4) Decent naked AC (33)<br>5) Some versatility with ability to cast level 6 cleric spells at 15th level, lay on hands, divine wrath, and a large number of short-term and long-term buffs.<br>6) Decent saves.<br>7) Good hit points for a build of this type(548 no-rerolls, 620 max).<br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif">   A solid array of monk feats: Improved Evasion, 145% run speed, Improved Knockdown, Diamond Body, Diamond Soul, Quivering Palm, and SR 30.<br><br>Weaknesses:<br><br>1) Still has fairly low unbuffed AB.<br>2) Will have to re-buff fairly frequently to maintain his strong AB.<br>3) Low damage potential without some type of elemental weapon, even with darkfire.<br>4) No uncanny dodge.<br><br>Starting/Final Stats<br>Str: 10<br>Dex: 16/24<br>Con: 18/22<br>Int: 10<br>Wis: 14/16<br>Cha: 6<br><br>Naked AC : 33 (or add +12 with maxed dex and wisdom for ac of 45)<br><br>Saves<br>Fort: 37<br>Reflex: 34<br>Will: 31<br><br>Domains: War (for short term self-buff and cat's grace), Other: Personal preference, I went with Strength for Divine Power at lvl 3 AND lvl 4, but Trickery, Travel, Air, and Magic all have good benefits as well.<br><br>BAB: 26<br>WF/EWF: +3<br>Dex: +7<br>Prowess: +1<br>Dual Weild: -2<br><br>Final AB with normal kamas: <br>35/32/29/26/23/20 + 35/32 (offhand) <br><br>(GMW, Div Favor, Div Power, Prayer, Aid, Battletide, Bless): <br>53/50/47/44/41/38 + 53/50 (offhand)<br><br>With above buffs, maxed dex and +5 weapon: <br>64/61/58/55/52/49 + 64/61 (offhand) <br><br>Skills:<br>Concentration: 10 (16)<br>Discipline: 42<br>Tumble: 40 <br>Spellcraft: 30<br><br>Pre-Epic Level Progression:<br>Monk 1-2<br>Cleric 3-6<br>Monk 7<br>Cleric 8-11<br>Monk 12<br>CoT 13-16<br>Cleric 17-20<br><br>Epic Level Progression:<br>CoT 21<br>Monk 22<br>Cleric 23-24<br>CoT 25-26<br>Cleric 27<br>CoT 28-30<br>Monk 31-40<br><br>Totals: Monk15/Cleric15/CoT10<br><br>Feats:<br>1: Dodge<br>3: Weapon Finesse<br>6: WF: Kama<br>9: Ambidexterity<br>12: Two-Weapon Fighting<br>14: Improved Two-Weapon Fighting*<br>15: Improved Critical: Kama<br>16: Toughness*<br>18: Blind-Fighting<br>21: Epic DR I<br>24: EWF: Kama<br>25: Great Wisdom I*<br>27: Epic DR II<br>28: Great Wisdom II*<br>30: Epic DR III, Armor Skin*<br>33: Great Dexterity I<br>36: Great Dexterity II<br>39: Epic Prowess<br><br>*CoT Bonus Feat<br><br>Stat Increases:<br>4, 8 into Dex<br>12, 16, 20, 24 into Con<br>28, 32, 36, 40 into Dex<br><br>Final HP's (no rerolls, in stance): 548 (Max: 620)<br><br>Just be sure to maximize tumble at all monk levels EXCEPT save points from 22 to your last cleric level at lvl 27---this should give you enough points to max spellcraft to 30.<br><br>I kept concentration low since the cleric casting is mostly done out of combat, but you can swap spellcraft and concentration if you'd prefer, depending on the environment you intend to play him in.<br><br>The order of levelling in the epic portion isn't as important--you could choose to simply take cleric all the way to 15 immediately, for instance, then take the rest of the CoT, then monk...it won't significantly affect the build except for how much spellcraft you'll end up having.<br><br>Notice compared to the first version this build picks up tons of monk feats, improved critical, blind-fighting, and the same naked ac as the first build but only with dwarven stance turned on (it was pointed out to me that dwarven stance is finicky, to say the least).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 08/11/05 14:59</span></i></p>

How would this work with a druid in place of the cleric class? I only ask because you could gain some advantages, but you would lose out in a few other things to. Whatever the case, I like this version better than your original as well.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

I like the build.  If you have seen my Walks with God (and Big Sword), you know that I prefer to take more cleric than monk.  Level 17 cleric casts level 9 spells.  For me, Level 12 was a big cut-off for the utility of monkhood.  Spell resistance, ah.  On that point, I count your SR at 25 (10 + monk level, right?).  <br><br>Anyway, it looks like a very fun build to play.

Very nice rebuild.  Non-dispelable SR along with 30+ saves makes for a potent mage battler.  Throw in some DR to prevent melee from said mage and you are looking decent.  Too bad you can't get more cleric levels in, for even greater spell casting, but that isn't really the point is it? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   Nicely done.<br>Keep in mind that you AB will increase by 2 when you go one handed, so its not really that bad.  Even one handed you get more attacks than most warriors, along with flurry of blows you have a nice schedule.  And plus, the point of the buffs is to make sure you can hit those tough opponents.<br><br>Cool.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"> <br><br>-C<br>_________________<br>"You cannot pass!"

Would it hurt this build if i wanted to go Unarmed Strike instead of using Kamas?

A lot!<br>Dualwield isn't applied on fists.<br>Many spells and effects (Darkfire, keen, forges to enchant weapons...) are useless if you're unarmed.<br>And monk's fist at level 15 is 1d12, it becomes 1d20 at 16

I stand corrected.
