This is a build that I made because, well, I'm cheesy and I love RDDs.  Again, alot of mobs on my PW have fear aura, and theres some synergy between RDD and Pally stat wise, so I went Pally instead of Ftr.  Ok I'll admit the real point of this build is to carry a big sword and have angel wings while maintaining a holy motif <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br><b>Playable 1 - 40 PvM + PvP(lite)</b><br><br>Human, LG<br><br>Str: 16 (34)<br>Dex: 10<br>Con: 10 (12)<br>Int: 12 (14)<br>Wis: 14<br>Cha: 14 (16)<br><br>Lvling guide:<br><br>1P - WF, PA<br>2P<br>3P - Cleave<br>4P<br>5P<br>6P - Great Cleave<br>7P<br>8P<br>9P - Devine Might<br>10P<br>11P<br>12P - Devine Shield<br>13P<br>14P<br>15P - Improved Crit <br>16P<br>17P<br>18P - KD<br>19P<br>20P<br>21S - Blind fight<br>22RDD<br>23RDD<br>24RDD - Over Crit<br>25RDD<br>26RDD<br>27RDD - Dev Crit<br>28RDD<br>29RDD<br>30RDD - EWF<br>31RDD<br>32S<br>33S - Armor Skin<br>34S<br>35S<br>36S - Epic Prowess<br>37S<br>38S<br>39S - IKD<br>40P<br><br>BAB: 30<br>AB: 46/41/36/31<br>Dam: 2-12 +18 (17-20 x2)<br>AC: 28 (plate)<br>HP: 332 (no rerolls)<br><br>Saves<br>Fort: 26 (34)<br>Ref: 19 (27)<br>Will: 21 (29)<br><br>Skills<br>Disc - 43<br>Lore - 8<br>SC - 42<br>Taunt - 43<br>tumble - 20<br>heal - 6<br><br>This guy could be better, I'm not really pleased with taking IKD at 39, but I'm not really sure what else to do.  <br>He's immune to fear, has very good buffs (Pally lvl 4 and Sorc lvl 4), dispells on hit 50%, and has Dev Crit with a good DC.  I suppose it would make more sense to go with scimitar/shield but I'm a sucker for two-handers.  The build doesnt change anyway.  He's also got a good AB + taunt + devine strike (+ true strike if ur really desperate), so he won't miss often.  Unfortunately he also won't be missed often either, and with 330 health that doesn't bode well.  Still, he has a good LoH and many defensive buffs to see him through, provided he doesn't get dispelled himself.<br>Ok so fix it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>....    ....    ....    ....<br><i>griphook ..Added classes to title</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 10/12/05 00:41</span></i></p>
