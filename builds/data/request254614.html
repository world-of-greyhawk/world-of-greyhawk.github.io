Honestly, might wanna go for sorceror instead. Charisma would be helpful to a bard.

I've toyed with the idea, but not come to anything I felt good about yet. I looked at a Bard/WIZ/RDD build as well, but again haven't tweaked it out to my satisfaction yet.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I agree with Jets, sorcerer has a better synergy.  Having bard spells available in the 1-6 spell level arena gives you a lot more flexibility in the spell selection area.  That's usually one of the main reasons to choose wizard over sorcerer (greater spell selection).  The other is the lack of feats on the sorcerer side which you would still have.  Of course, you'd probably still want to make a decent investment in intelligence to get more skill points.  <br><br>Either way, I'd consider going 16 bard.  It's a sweet spot for the bard song.  Granted you are making yourself susceptable to dispells, so it's probably six of one 1/2 dozen of the other.<br>_________________<br>In order to find his equal, an Irishman is forced to talk to<br>God.

Bard will synergize nicely with both Wizard and Sorceror, imo, though for different reasons.  The sorceror benefits from shared stats, but the wizard benefits a lot more from the Bard's skill set.  The Bard spells can always be used for utility spells a wizard may not typically keep memorized.<br><br>The way I've built Wizard/ Bards is with a max Int, curse song, and however many spell foci I can fit in.  A level 15 Curse Song will reduce all your opponents saves by 2, effectively increasing all of your Spell DCs, which can be a big deal for certain Necromancers, Enchanters, and Transmuters.  15 levels is a pretty heavy investment, but with only 6 Bard levels you can decrease saves by 1 while keeping plenty of skill dumps for later levels, or perhaps even leaving enough room for a sprinkling of a third class.  Personally, I prefer the Bard 6-ish variant because it puts less pressure on Charisma and Wizard caster levels.<br>_________________<br>(I enjoy writing parenthetically (a lot)).

I know this is an old thread, but I'm curious, what if you were to specialize with Wizard that didn't allow the use of invis spell, but since bards can cast invis, would that work or would the engine deny it?
