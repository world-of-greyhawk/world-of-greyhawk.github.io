I want an elven monk/cleric. dex base. With starting DEX and WIS at 18 and 16 is probably best. Ending WIS is enough at 20.<br> Perma Haste items availible, no dev crit, up to +8 gloves. Straight lvl 40 build is fine with me. This is for a small PvP server I play with some friends. Can possibly max 1 stat plus half max another from items alone. He is going unarmed, since the best gloves are better than the best kama's.<br><br>I have built one of these with 6 CoT levs for gr WIS feats.<br>I think Monk 18 and Cleric 15 is what would work nice. Perhaps Plant domains for Barkskin, and trickery for Invis spells. You have empty body though. For third class, perhaps something with uncanny dodge instead of CoT, or something with UMD, or even SD 5 for epic dodge perhaps.<br><br>I have many thoughts running through my head, feed me suggestions and I will churn it through inn my mind, and communicate underways.<br><br>Thanks in advance.

leave wis at 18.  pump dex.  add in SD.  aim from ED and maybe a few SC.<br>the benefit from rogue would be Sneak attack and UMD.  Sneak loses some benefit for only a few levels on high magic worlds.  umd is alright, but you can already use monk stuff and cast any divine spell from a scroll or your spellbook (minus lvl 9 spells, that is).<br><br>*shrugs*  that help?<br><br>-c

Mod this however you like if you're going to use it (I tried to make it playable 1-40 with no EXP-penalty but it's probably best starting at 40) :S - it's got lowish AB. Monk 18/ Cleric 17/ SD 5 is also good.

It will be easier to make this build as human. <br>You get one more skill point per level, and have no xp penalty.<br>You get more freedom when choosing levelling order.<br>With Int 14 you get enough skillpoints to get fair ranks in fighter skills (discipline tumble), stealth (hide move silently), caster skills(spellcraft concentration) and a couple of points for some RP skills (spot lore persuade).With this class combo, they can all be taken as class skills.<br>Your dex will be lower, but you'll have no problem with Epic Dodge at lvl 36 or 39.<br>If you go heavy on cleric, like 23 or 26 levels, you can take Great wisdom as one of your bonus feats (maybe Armor skin as the other), leaving room for Epic weapon focus, Epic dodge and Great dexterity V on your regular feats. If you start with Dex 16 and Wis 16 you can have Dex 18 and Wis 19 at level 20, ending with Dex 28 and Wis 20 at level 40.<br>Trickery is a good domain for this character with improved invisibility and divine trickery.<br>War, Strength and Travel are all worth considering as the second domain.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

Hmm, monk/cleric/sd would be difficult to kill I guess but you'll not be doing much damage even with all the cleric buffs.  Uber gloves might compensate for this though.  I think you're going to need some other way of generating damage, like sneaks or something.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By jwlademann on 11/24/05 13:46</span></i></p>

Thanks for your posts, very helpful so far.<br>Jennalee, your starting stats are wrong. It should be<br><br>Str 8<br>Dex 18<br>Con 12<br>Int 12<br>Wis 16<br>Cha 8<br><br>And Mick, for reasons I don't bother mentioning, it shall be an Elven Monk/Cleric. It will be impossible to go Human for an elven monk/Cleric, right? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>If anyone else has suggestions, keep them coming, or any of you have more. Thanks so far.
