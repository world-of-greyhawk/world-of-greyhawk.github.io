One of the best epics I ever made was this combination of Bardsong and devastating critical plus a good naked AC and immunityes of a Red Dragon Dissiple.<br>  The beguinning atributes where:<br>   STR16 to 28<br>   DEX12 to 12<br>   CON14 to 23<br>   INT12 to 12<br>   WIS10 to 10<br>   CAR10 to 12<br> and a focus on the rapier to have critical hits more often and a higguer chance of Devastating Critical.<br> The AB with a non magical rapier is: 45/40/35/30.<br> And good saving trhows:<br> FORT30<br> REFL24<br> WILL27<br> and a list of immunityes due to the Red Dragon Dissiple class, as well as a breath weapon of a lv10 RDD.<br> The hitpoints are strong as well, with a total of 345 or more if the hit dices are high.<br> One of the only weaknesses of the Dragoon Cavalier is his low rank on spot and listen, which makes him a little weak against sneak attaks,but the ranks he has are enough to detect low level rougues.<br> I am not posting my entire build here YET because it need more testing, but it is showing out to be a grat build for these that don't have patiebce using buffing spells or complicated tactics.

taking another bard at level 40 allows max tumble AC.. <br><br>EDIT<br>also could you not skim rdd10 at level 39 or 40 to max listen/spot?<br><br>-DaMouse<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DaMouse404 on 03/22/05 22:51</span></i></p>
