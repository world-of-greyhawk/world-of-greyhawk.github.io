The Evensong is a woman of legendary beauty and evil.  On sultry, summer evenings she stalks the enemies of her dark lord.  She sings to her prey from the shadows, a haunting melody from an unknown source.  It is a seductive song, tantalizing and filled with sensual tension, causing the heart of her prey to race in anticipation and dulling their wits.  Many a victim will look about with longing, seeking a glimpse of the deadly siren that lulls them to their deaths.  However, only the luckiest hear her song whispered seductively in their ear, or perchance glimpse a flash of steel, before they succumb to her poisoned blade.<br><br>NOTE: I made this build before viewing the following  builds with the same classes, but wasn't settled on a name.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "233790", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Shadow Guard (Bard 11, Blackguard 16, SD 13)</a><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "229249", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Evanescent Canticle ( Bard 25 / SD 2 / BG 13 )</a><br><br><br>-------------------------<br><br><b>Bard 13/Blackguard 25/Shadow Dancer 2</b><br><br>Human - Neutral or Chaotic Evil<br><br><b>PvM 1-40</b><br><br>STR 14(18)<br>DEX 14<br>CON 14<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 14(24)<br><br><br>Leveling<br><br>1 BRD 1: Power Attack, Cleave <br>2 BRD 2: <br>3 BRD 3: Lingering Song<br>4 BRD 4: (CHA = 15)<br>5 BRD 5<br>6 BRD 6: Dodge<br>7 BRD 7<br>8 BRD 8: (CHA = 16)<br>9 BG 1: Mobility<br>10 BG 2 <br>11 BG 3<br>12 BG 4: Weapon Focus - Greatsword (CHA = 17)<br>13 SD 1 *<br>14 BG 5<br>15 BG 6: Knockdown<br>16 BG 7: (CHA = 18)<br>17 SD 2 *<br>18 BG 8: Divine Might<br>19 BG 9<br>20 BG 10: (CHA = 19)<br>21 BG 11: Improved Critical - Greatsword<br>22 BRD 9 *<br>23 BG 12 <br>24 BG 13: Divine Shield, EWF - Greatsword (CHA = 20)<br>25 BG 14<br>26 BG 15<br>27 BRD 10: Curse Song *<br>28 BG 16: Epic Prowess (CHA = 21)<br>29 BG 17 <br>30 BG 18: Great CHA I (CHA = 22)<br>31 BG 19: Armor Skin<br>32 BRD 11: (CHA = 23) *<br>33 BG 20: Great CHA II (CHA = 24)<br>34 BG 21<br>35 BG 22: Epic Toughness I %<br>36 BG 23: Great STR I (STR = 16)<br>37 BRD 12<br>38 BG 24<br>39 BG 25: Great STR II, Improved Sneak Attack (STR = 17) <br>40 BRD 13: (STR = 18)<br><br>* - Placed for maximizing Tumble potential<br>% - Swappable with Epic Fiendish Servant<br><br><b>Skills</b> <br>255 Points Total (Unbuffed Stat Bonus)<br><br>Concentration - 43 (45)<br>Discipline - 43 (47)<br>Hide - 43 (45)<br>Move Silently - (45)<br>Perform - 11 (18)<br>Spellcraft - 30<br>Tumble - 40<br>UMD - 2 (9)<br><br><b>HP</b> 444 Max (452 w/ Bard's Song)<br><br><b>Saving Throws</b> (unbuffed v.

I'd swap Epic Toughness, but for Improved Knockdown, as with a 9d6 sneak you'll be using it a lot, even with your HiPS.<br><br>Good damage, and good build.

Nice! I love to see a good Bard. Feat-starved a bit, aye?<br><br>Thax, he can't do that, because the Epic Toughness is taken as a Blackguard bonus feat and all his general feat slots - yes, all of them - are already used for important feats.<br>_________________<br>"And one calculates <i>time</i> from the <i>dies nefastus</i> on which this fatality arose – from the <i>first</i> day of Christianity! – <i>Why not rather from its last?</i> – <i>From today?</i> – Revaluation of all values!"

Yeah, a little feat starved.  I gave up 2 Great Charisma feats to fit in some more important ones like Lingering Song and Divine Shield from my initial build.  Not sure I want to give up more, since I'd lose more spells. :/<br><br>Originally I had 26 Charisma and I took Great Smiting I instead of Epic Toughness I.  But that Smite Good just doesn't seem that great to me, and Divine Shield and Lingering Song seem much more useful.  Also lost 1 more level 4 spell per day with that.<br><br>Edit: At the time I made this build, I thought it was an original build. But that may have been due to the fact that the search engine went un-updated for such a long time.  Thus, I was simply trying to create a Bard/Blackguard/SD.  It should be noted that I took some cues from grizzled's Valkyrie build while considering build options.  I really like that one a lot. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Ythaniel on 04/20/06 18:04</span></i></p>
