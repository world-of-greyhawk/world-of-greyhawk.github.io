I apologize in advance for posting what appears to be a repeat submission.  However, considering the changes, I decided to start a new thread. <br><br>This combination is an improvement over the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "208015", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Sneaky Defender</a> in that is secures Epic Dodge at level 36.  This makes a HIPS, sneak attacking blender who dodges the first attack and has significant DR to absorb subsequent attacks.

Looking at your build, I can't help but suggest the following:  first drop Shadowdancer altogether.  You don't need Hips.  Second, this build seriously needs ITWF, Knockdown, and Improved Knockdown and, consequently, a higher Intelligence.  Third, he needs a higher AB and needs a higher will save since he doesn't have slippery mind which most Rogue builds get.  <br><br>What would you say if I could increase his AC by two, AB by one, give him 40 more Hit points, Knockdown, Improved Knockdown, ITWF, higher strength, 50+ more skillpoints, +4 saves across the board, Epic Dodge by level 28, 100% more playable pre-epic, and in so doing lose only HiPS and 3 DR?<br><br>Observe:<br><br><br>Str12<br>Int14<br>Wis8<br>Con18(22)<br>Dex16(26)<br>Chr6<br><br>1Rogue1, Knockdown<br>2Rogue2<br>3Rogue3, Weapon Finesse<br>4Rogue4, Dex=17<br>5Rogue5<br>6Rogue6, Weapon Focus<br>7Rogue7<br>8Rogue8, Dex18<br>9Rogue9, Dodge<br>10Rogue10, Improved Evasion<br>11CoT1<br>12Rogue11, Toughness, Dex19<br>13CoT2, Two-Weapon-Fighting<br>14CoT3<br>15CoT4, Improved Knockdown, Ambidexterity<br>16DwD1, Dex20<br>17Rogue12<br>18DwD2, ITWF<br>19DwD3<br>20DwD4, Dex21<br>21CoT5, Great Dex I<br>22Rogue13,Def Roll<br>23CoT6, EWF<br>24DwD5, Great Dex II, Dex24<br>25DwD6<br>26Rogue14<br>27Rogue15, Great Dex III<br>28Rogue16, Epic Dodge, Con19<br>29DwD7<br>30DwD8, Great Con I<br>31DwD9<br>32Rogue17, Con21<br>33CoT7, Epic Prowess<br>34CoT8, EDR I<br>35CoT9<br>36CoT10, EDR II, EDR III, Dex26<br>37Rogue18<br>38Rogue19, Improved Sneak I<br>39DwD10, Armor Skin<br>40Rogue20, Con22<br><br>Final AC: 28(29)<br>AB: 39<br>Dualwielding: 37/32/27/25/37/32<br>Hit Points: 620 (700 in Stance)<br>Skill Points: 310<br>DR: 15/-<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Thanks for the feedback Griz!  Very nicely done.  <br><br>I tried to consider my particular PW (Soulforge, or SF)in developing this character.  SF is a moderate magic world, with lots of hard hitting critters.  So, the best chance at survival is to have three things:  1) Damage Reduction, 2) High AC, and/or 3) The ability to "get out of the way" when things get hot.  <br><br>Therefore, I chose to get DR first, ergo the DD levels early on for at least 18-21 DR.  The Epic Dodge comes into its own at about the 30s when we start getting really pounded by the epic critters we find at that level.  HIPS is a bonus and meets the "get out of the way" criteria, although many critters have true sight.  <br><br>Your adjustments are great but doesn't have enough DR to be useful on SF, and although I would get Epic Dodge earlier, its not really needed at that point.  I'll keep playing with your theme though and see what I come up with.  <br><br>Again, great feedback, thanks!<br>_________________<br>TeoDeathDealer<br>Member of SoulForge PW (Action)

In my mind, Epic Dodge trumps DR.  It seems like you still might be able to get 10DwD levels of DR and still get your Epic Dodge by Lvl28, but this would still postpone your EDR feats until the 30s.

I can see why you would like to keep it.  Consider, though, that in some sense it makes him a 1-trick pony, as he really doesn't have any other way to generate sneaks.

Well, I tend to agree that KD and IKD are really useful here.  Would it be wise then to substitute two-weapon fighting for KD feats?  Get an AC boost with a shield, too.

The two DD levels at the end should be switched to rogue, as they give you only 12 hp in favor of rogue. Nothing else. But with rogue levs you get 1d6 sneak, an extra rogue feat(slippery mind?) at 16 and you can take tumble to 40, and max stealth and UMD skills if you like.<br><br>Another thing, drop those initiative feats, with high dex, you win it anyway. Take great dex feats instead. Or epic prowess as one of them.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 08/20/05 12:59</span></i></p>

The only thing I see at quick glance is that you could gain a point of BAB if you re-ordered your rogue levels and swapped one DwD for rogue pre-epic so you were Rogue 12, DwD 8. bab = 17 instead of 16 and I dont see what harm it would do.<br><br>Overall, I think it will be a good build as long as you dont get too frustrated at lower levels.  Solo isnt going to be much fun, but in a group especially with someone buffing you, you'll do well.  Against undead/sneak-immune foes you will not pack much of a punch, but between the hitpoints and DR it should still be playable.  Once you past level 30 when you start topping off the DR and gain Epic Dodge, I think the build will get better and better.<br><br>I just started playing on SF and I assume LordTeo is one of your chars, I was the guy who asked about why you switched to dislike.  Anyway, good luck with your build and see you on SF.<br><br>UK<br><br>EDIT:<br>Oh and you might want to work in crippling strike.  Each sneak gives monsters -2STR= -1 AB and -1 Damage and its cumulative! Next to Imp evasion, I think its the best rogue feat.  Since you will gain one with Grim's changes, that would be my pick.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Unforgettableknight on 08/22/05 18:11</span></i></p>
