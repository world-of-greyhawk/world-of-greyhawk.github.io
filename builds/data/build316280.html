I feel like I cheated using the same format as my Feinting Fencer, but the builds are so similar. Basically I’m just dropping 1 AB, HIPS, an epic feat, and some HP for UMD and Sneak Attack, which some will find is a better deal depending on scrolls you have available, server rules, etc. I also realize such a build is quite obvious to a builder, but we don't seem to have it on record, and I know having it here will help out a lot of people.<br><br>This build is great for PvP against melee types, especially strength based melee types.

The main differences are that the Shadow Knight picks up Self Conceal V with more rogue levels, and loses AB with less Weapon Master levels. It depends on what your server is like, but, I don’t think Self Conceal V is worth its weight. You’re a rogue! Find a scroll of Improved Invisibility or something! Also, your AC is high enough (With Epic Dodge), that you’re probably not going to get much at all anyway.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 05/27/10 20:51</span></i></p>

Meh, six of one, half dozen of the other.  In my eyes, the differences are negligible.  Dual-wielding to sword and board?  Not a really difficult swap.  Elf to Halfling?  The minor variation in stats?  Just sayin', they seem mostly the same build.<br><br>And do we need an elven sword and boarder version?  Is it improved over the original?  If someone needs to modify an existing build, then that can be done, but I don't see that the ECB is the place for every minor variation of a template.<br><br>Which is really all this comes down to.  Fine build (well, kinda... still a DEXer...), just IMO it's already been done, and I really don't see that we need a bazillion versions of the same build 'just for reference.'  There's no enormous harm done or anything. I just don't like clutter.  The ECB certainly doesn't need more clutter.  But, it aint my guild, any more than it is yours, so I'll leave you be with your elven, sword and board, version of a build as old as dirt.

Wow, I'm just shocked.

I have no intention of poster bashing.  Indeed, the one thing I admire here is the effort.  They're pretty decently put together builds.  My issue is with where they appear.  Once upon a time, a build posted to the ECB meant something.  The guild was an useful depository of templates.  Repeating a build (or nearly so) only causes clutter, adding little, if anything, of value, and making it more difficult to use the resources here.  I guess lately most folks are glad to see anything posted, even if it isn't entirely appropriate.<br><br>In case y'all don't read the rules, this is an except from the rules and guidelines sticky above:<br><br>"• A build which ends up to be the same as an already exsisting one a few minor tweaks apart should not be posted. Such tweaks should instead be suggested as a reply post in the original build thread."<br><br>Clearly it's arguable what constitutes "a few minor tweaks."  That's what I'm arguing.  It's nothing personal.  It's just about what the rules of the Guild are, which happen, in this instance, to re-enforce my personal desire for an useful, and organized depository of templates. It aint my guild.  I don't make the rules, but I do read them.

I have read the rules, in the past I must admit, but I have. In any case. With the amount of people who have gone away from NWN 1 and the elderly state of the game, I believe that encouraging people to post builds is probably advantageous. <br><br>The author in this case missed giving kudos to Mith for having a similar build but he did say it had done before, and did have reasons for thinking it was different. That brings me to think about quite a few builds over the past that have been posted as new and gave credit where it was due to builders who had inspired them. One such posting that comes to mind was when Grizzled Dwarflord's Zhentarim Field Agent build was redone by Tatooed Monk who gave total credit for his inspiration. <br><br>He simply refitted the build to work as a human, added a second weapon focus to deal with a particular server situation and posted. I see nothing wrong with that, even the Dwarflord told him he did a good job at it.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "304886", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>My main concern if anything is finding entirely duplicated builds which have been renamed and basically stolen from the exceptional builders that created them. <br><br>Thanks Onion for explaining your point of view and considering mine.<br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.

Guys, <br><br>I'd like you to try and see the other side of the coin. I understand your frustration, but I can speak to you as a novice builder. See, you guys have been here for a long time, some more than 6 years, while other people that have joined recently, such as myself, have come to find a HUGE pre-existing database. You have had a chance to be original and contribute with something, while the newer members have not had such luxury. There is, as onion points out, very little left to be done in terms of that. I will try to exemplify:<br><br>While I was away from the guild, I created a few builds using the CBC. Said builds were made WITHOUT LOOKING into any information that lies herein, because pulse cap's search engine was moved and I didn't know where to find the new one. I'll list them for you:<br><br>- The HOOD (Half-Orc Of Doom) - Barbarian (28) / Bard (2) / RDD (10) - Upon my return, I posted this one because I thought it had enough differences from other builds to get its own topic, but the EXACT SAME LEVEL SPREAD is present in at least 6 other builds.<br><br>- Druid (28) / Monk (2) / Champion of Torm (10) - This build is somewhat different from Kail's Nature Wyrm (which is illegal BTW, you need WF on a melee weapon to become a CoT and he doesn't have it), because it has slightly better AB and Saves, has Greater Ruin and Hellball, while dropping the Disarm line and losing 2 caster levels, spell focus or spell penetration (you gotta choose one of the two lines to drop) and 1 AC from Monk 5. I'm still thinking whether or not to post this build.<br><br>- Fighter (10) / WM (25) / Rogue (5) - It's already been done, there is one that is almost identical to mine with only a different weapon (Bastard Sword instead of Katana)<br><br>- Wizard (23) / Cleric (15) / Monk (2) - I just resurrected a 2005 topic with no replies because it was almost identical to my build. <br><br>I think that's it. So as you see, what will happen if people follow the rules is that you'll get an endless number of topics resurrected from oblivion because new guys will be coming in with nothing new to offer, since it's all been done before. <br><br>@ onion eater<br><br>is <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_builds.html" target="_blank">this</a> what you'd like to see??<br><br>Take it EZ fellas!

Just sayin'. <br><br>Anyways, I'm not at all against folks posting builds that may be similar to an already posted build if there's a good reason for it.  When that happens, the poster should make an argument as to why the build deserves posting.  I may or may not buy the argument, but it does need to be made, preferably in great detail. If the argument doesn't pass muster, IMO the build should be removed, as per the rules.  That doesn't really happen in practice, but for clarity and organization's sake, I wish it would.<br><br>Anyways...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By onion eater on 05/28/10 01:37</span></i></p>
