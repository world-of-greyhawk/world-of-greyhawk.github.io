Ok stumbled upon this "issue" during a PvP battle on my server.<br><br>An elf gets Keen Senses and apperently can detect improved invisible creatures if they stand next to it (and thus hit the improved invisible person)<br><br>Now I'm creating an elven monk with 8 str (-1 damage) and having keen sense. (Also better KD due to size difference)<br><br>The other option is being halfling with 6 str (-2 damage) but +1 to AC, +1 to AB and an extra skillpoint per lvl.<br>(Worse KD due to size difference)<br><br>I'm in doubt what would be best suitable since I never knew Keen Senses were this b0rked.<br><br>The build is a Dex monk with high saves with CoT help.<br>The AB is pretty terrible so the Halfling race would help a bit, but not sure if its worth the trade-off with Keen Senses and the whole size/ab/ac/extra skillpoint thing.<br><br>Have you guys heard of this? And do you know what would be better suitible?<br><br>// Maniac_Mailman<br>_________________<br><i>"Omnes morimur et quasi aqua dilabimur in terram, qua non revertuntur..."</i><br>- Maniac_Mailman aka Nr|Five<br><br>Admin @ NWN BOTD Team PvP<br>Admin @ <a href="http://www.gameshrine.org" target="_blank">www.gameshrine.org</a><br><br>Member of the Epic Character Builders Guild

I'm pretty sure any character has a chance to detect Invis/Imp Invis creatures if they're close by. It's a Spot/Listen check vs a Hide/Move check. (In the case of invis, the Listen check is the important one). Elves get a +2 bonus to Listen (as do Halflings and Gnomes, and 1/2 Elves get a +1 bonus), which I would guess is what was making the difference.<br><br>Keen Senses only give you full Search skills when making a passive Search check, nothing else AFAIK.<br>_________________<br>Where I'm playing now: <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk.</a>

It's actually somewhat useful, a character with keen senses is like having Detect Mode on all the time, just try to change Detect Mode to on and it will state somethin like: "Detect mode can't be enabled, characters with keen senses always have it active", if your listen check is high a character with keen senses would spot invisible creatures all the time, fast and effective, but you need the listen check, if not you could say that Arcane Archers are immune to enemies hiding, which is not really the case, but if you get near the enemy it's most probable that you will be able to see him.<br><br>Now, I would take the elf and make it a dexer.....
