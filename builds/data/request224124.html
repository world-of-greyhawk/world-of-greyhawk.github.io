i was looking through some dragon builds and was wondering which class combo would get the highest ab if you could get enough items to max out it's strength?

Well as long as you get 16 fighter with 4 monk or 4 druid pre epic it doesn't do jack *** to your AB <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>-DaMouse

OK, one more question <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  I could switch fighter for some other melee class that gets the same bab progression right? Or is fighter the best option?

Sure you could.. I just picked fighter because it gets loads of bonus feats.. it's poor will save is remedied by Dragons mind immunity etc etc <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-DaMouse

Fighter also gives you 6 extra damage on your unarmed attacks with EWS. That comes in handy vs DR.<br><br>But the best AB would be taking only fighter pre epic, and enough Druid epic. It won't be that playable perhaps, but it will give you 1 more AB at lvl 40. I wouldn't do it though.<br><br>Let me do some calculations on AB with DaMouses suggestions.<br><br>29 BAB + 4 feats + 2 Druid outdoors + 25 STR(60)=60.<br>Not to shabby. With monk in it, hasted and with Flurry your attacks would look like this:<br>58/55/53/50/47/44/58/60.<br><br>With EWS unarmed your damage is 2d8 + 31. Not to bad.<br><br>Take Improved Crit to.<br><br>Stunning fist DC will be quite formidable to, and it works in Dragonform.<br>Your breath weapon will be diddly-squat, with luck it kills a lvl 1 goblin.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;which class combo would get the highest ab if you could get enough items to max out it's strength?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Enough items? If you have a armor and shield giving you +6 each in normal form, they don't stack while shifted.

The +6 damage from weapon spec doesn't work as far as I know for Dragon Form and the UBAB is capped at +19/+16/+13/+10/+7/+4 at 20 iirc<br><br>Have a nice day<br><br>-DaMouse

(and other unarmed forms?) As does WF, EWF and IC.<br><br>You are right that at lvl 20 you can max get +19/+16/+13/+10/+7/+4, because you would need monk to get that progression, and monk 1 loses 1 BAB. But it isn't capped. If you take fighter 20 first, then 1 monk to get his attack progression you will at lvl 21 have +21/+18/+15/+12/+9/+6. Because lvl 21 also gives an AB.

i didn't think WF, WS etc worked because dragons used the creature weapon?

Firstly.. seeing is not always believing.. and iirc tis the game that caps UBAB at that.. I just made a test build with pure 20 fighter and 1 monk. It had UBAB 21 but had 20BAB +1 Weapon Focus (taking that to test EWS) to hit on my rolls.<br><br>As for EWS.. I'm unsure if it's actually working or not.. some of the damage seems a bit off but the majority stays within non EWS range. If you give me some kind of damage analysis program I could test this further <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>-DaMouse<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DaMouse404 on 12/18/05 16:17</span></i></p>
