I've not been active here for a while, because work has been very busy lately, but I've picked up doing some builds and playing the OC again. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Now I have a build that is more or less like the Reliable Archer on the Epic Builds page. I have two feats left to choose pre-epic, but don't know which ones to take.<br><br>I was thinking of either:<br>- dodge and mobility: for extra AC with AOO's while shooting arrows<br><br>- ambidexterity and two weapon fighting: for being able to do some melee too (I already have weapon finesse, because of my high dex it's usefull in the early levels when archery isn't that good yet)<br><br>So which one to pick? Or are there other (better) possibilities? I already have feats like rapid shot, called shot, pointblank shot and focus/specialization.<br><br>Thanx in advance for your help <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .
