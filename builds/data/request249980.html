Only way to get EDR III is to have 21+ CON. If you want high DC as well, you'll need high INT (WIZ) or CHA (SOR). Best bet is Dwarf or Gnome. Dwarf works for WIZ, Gnome works for both WIZ and SOR.<br><br>Hmmmm, starting with 18 CON, you could also start with 18 INT, leaving 4 points for DEX, STR, and WIS. I'd leave WIS at 8, and raise DEX and STR to 10. Or, go with this (assuming Dwarf, the best race bar none):<br><br>STR 8<br>DEX 12<br>CON 18<br>INT 18<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 6<br><br>For Gnome, you could go with SOR:<br><br>STR 6<br>DEX 8*<br>CON 18<br>INT 12*<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 18<br><br>*Adjust these to your personal preference.<br><br>Raise CON 4 times to get to 22 (I like to even the ability scores out). The other 6 go to INT/CHA, and take as many GRT INT/CHA feats as you can fit in, while also grabbing the 3 EDR feats.<br><br>Not sure if it's worth it for only 9/- DR though.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Oh well, my <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "238107", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Arcane Wall V2 (Wizard 22 / Dwarven Defender 18)</a> is probably the highest DR caster around. Of course his DCs are crap, so spam IGMS, with that in mind he can be pretty effective. Check if it can help you.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 08/16/06 00:39</span></i></p>

Why the hell do you need EDR at all, when you can get Epic Warding? Don't they need a +20 Weapon to surpass it? Most server's won't get you that.

If you are making a Damage Resistance mage for <b>PvP</b>, there is really only 1 option: PM Spammer<br><br>I see ABSOLUTELY no point in having ANY damage reduction if you can be hit with critical hits &amp; sneak attacks.<br><br>Your average PM Spammer looks something like this:<br><br>Sorc 29 / Paladin 1 / Pale Master 10<br><br>taking Paladin lvl at lvl 39 to maximize discipline &amp; take ESF: Discipline<br><br>Further to this you should take the following feats:<br><br>Pre-Epic: spell penetration, greater spell penetration, spell focus (x), greater spell focus (x), skill focus: discipline, skill focus: concentration, maximize spell<br><br>Epic: Great Charisma I &amp; II, Epic Damage Reduction I, II &amp; III, Epic Warding, Epic Spell Penetration, Epic Spell Focus (x), ESF: Discipline, Epic Energy Resistance: Fire<br><br>Dwarf, stats: str 8, dex 8, con 18 (22), int 12, cha 16 (24)<br><br>I would forget about getting decent DCs on your spells and either spam Icestorms or IGMSes, put your Acid Sheathes up and just watch whilst people try and batter themselves to death as you spam IGMS to their FACE<br><br>PM Spammers are easy to shut down though with a decent dedicated mage!

Cinn makes a nice variant of my build, I like mine because you can spam IGMS and Ice Storms anyway, and the HP is hell high, your critical must be awesome (scythe weapon masters for example) to really work out the DR and HP while the buffs are on, sneaks could be troublesome.<br><br>Yeah, Okembour makes a good point, and you could make a build much better than mine if your DR is going to be only Epic Warding, just watch the duration.<br><br>PM? nice idea, while you're at it why not Sorc/PM/Rogue instead? I think Uncanny, Evasion and UMD will serve better than what a Paladin can provide.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 08/18/06 03:17</span></i></p>

Yes, the PM idea is definetly necissary in PvP, especially when builds can have Dev Crit which will basically laugh at your Damage Reduction. I think Sneaks can pass DR as well, no? That part I'm not sure, but a Death Attack will still hurt with the paralyzation.<br><br>Pale Master will also allow you to get more than decent AC, with Epic levels, while simultaniously giving you the ability to get Epic spells such as Warding. If you can't get an alignment shift for the Paladin though, Blackgaurd will work for you just the same if you can get the pre-requisits... which aren't -too- hard. Good AC, good saves, and Epic Warding to resist damage while your PM abilities save you from Crits and Death Attack.<br><br>Great defensively, and can smash faces in, as krsboss said, with IGMS.<br><br>Perfect.

Sneaker builds generally take at least around 7d6, that's 7-42 damage, which is enough to go past DRs, a great sneaker could go much higher, 13d6 is normally what strong sneakers deal, 13-78 is a lot of damage. Death attack is a hard call, the damage is good, yes, but don't trust the DC against someone with EDR, its Fortitude should be high, death attack DC is actually very hard to make it really high...
