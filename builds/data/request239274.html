Does anyone out there know of a high Damage monk build that has a good Attack Bonus and yet retains decent Armor Class for survivability? I am starting on a new server and looks to be very hard to level. Prestige classes are by acceptance only and there is no swapping of equipment from char to char. So I am looking for something with a good playability all the way up. No alignment switches or anything please.

Also, what’s the best way to get around Monster Damage Reduction?

Well, you can try my Temple Guardian build (str-based Monk/Fighter/CoT). <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "226517", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Can go unarmed or use kamas. Naked AB of 41, plenty of damage output, can get Dev Crit if you want it.<br><br>If you like sneaky types, you can try Felonius Monk (dex-based Rogue/Monk/Fighter). <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225896", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Gets very high AC, Epic Dodge, naked AB is 42, normal damage is lowish but he has a lot of sneak damage.<br><br>For getting around DR of the 20/+X type, use a kama or gloves of +X or higher. <br><br>For getting around DR of 20/-, you just have to do more damage. Go Str-based, buff your str, do lots of sneak damage, or get lots of elemental damage on your weapon/gloves.<br><br>TM

Would it be possible to make the temple guardian build with a base race of half orc instead of dwarf or would that effect the integrity of the build?

Well, it will cost you 2 Int and 2 Con, so you'll have 40 fewer HP, and 40 fewer skillpoints (you will also talk funny, if RP matters to you). You will pick up 1 AB and 1 damage. If you want the AB and damage without losing the skillpoints, you could drop Wis or Con by 2 to bump Int back up to 10, sacrificing either another 40 HP or 1 AC to retain the skillpoints and not talk funny. <br><br>Personally, I prefer the dwarf build, but it will still work as a half-orc.<br><br>TM

If it matters to you, you'll also get a 20% XP penalty if you use 1/2 Orc.<br>_________________<br>Where I'm playing now: <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk.</a>

Ouch! Well that won’t work then. I am just having a hard time coming up with a story describing why a dwarf would give up his race’s mastery over weapons and armor to run around half naked flailing left and right with punches and kicks. Not to mention explaining his COT levels.

As Kail noted, you can roleplay it as Champion of Moradin. I fail to see why classes such as CoT and RDD can't be roleplayed as a different god/dragon (hopefully they aren't completely literal on these where you play).<br><br>As for a Dwarf Monk - I don't see the issue. Remember Grimgnaw from the OC/HotU?<br>_________________<br>Where I'm playing now: <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk.</a>

Good idea! Guess I was being close minded lol. I still find it really hard to imagine a dwarf that doesn’t wear heavy armor and wield a massive warhammer. Although he could be a Champion of Tavern Brawls hehe!   “Ach, cut off… cut off… why ill lay ye out to dry you silly little elf!”
