ok, just by reading the topic you know what im thinking.... actually even I dont know what im thinking, but that doesn't seem to stop me.<br><br>the reason of this build is two fold,<br>one is very straight forward, lvl 22 of DD is a magical lvl on this PW that I play on.<br>two, i kinda of wanted to get a build that does a lot of close in combat, but doesn't sacrifice magic for a strong melee presence. (thats why its the dd/wm combo)<br><br>Dwarf...

only thing i would suggest, get the feats order correct to make it real.  Its up to you on the rest.  Ck the forums for many cleric/wm builds that are out there (i did a dwarf myself).   The bottom line is DO YOU think you are too thin?  everything else is just opinion.<br><br>no idea bout the crit thing..  in this build though, go for overwhelmin crit OR try to get con high for epic dr imho which may be difficult seein that you need to use wis/int/dex already and takin con to 21 is alot out of this build.<br><br>peace
