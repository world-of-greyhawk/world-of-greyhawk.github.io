This is my first build. Be gentle, I don't know much.<br><br>The idea behind this build is to emulate the members of the Belmont family from the Castlevania series. The whip known as the Vampire Killer is their common weapon, so I could not, in good spirits, use another weapon. I took Ranger levels for the Favored Enemies.<br><br>Name:<br>Descendant of Belmont<br><br>Build:<br>Ranger 14/Fighter 16/Shadowdancer 10<br><br>Race:<br>Human<br><br>Alignment:<br>Lawful Good<br><br>Abilities(Final):<br>STR: 12 (14)<br>DEX: 18 (30)<br>CON: 10<br>WIS: 11<br>INT: 13<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Progression:<br>01: Ranger(1): Weapon Focus: Whip, Weapon Proficiency(Exotic), Favored Enemy: Undead<br>02: Ranger(2)<br>03: Ranger(3): Dodge<br>04: Ranger(4): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br>05: Ranger(5): Favored Enemy: Outsiders<br>06: Ranger(6): Mobility<br>07: Ranger(5)<br>08: Ranger(6): DEX+1, (STR=20)<br>09: Shadowdancer(1): Weapon Finisse<br>10: Shadowdancer(2)<br>11: Shadowdancer(3)<br>12: Shadowdancer(4): DEX+1, Blind-Fight, (DEX=21)<br>13: Fighter(1): Knockdown<br>14: Fighter(2): Improved Knockdown<br>15: Fighter(3): Iron Will<br>16: Fighter(4): DEX+1, Weapon Specialization: Whip (DEX=22)<br>17: Fighter(5)<br>18: Fighter(6): Improved Critical: Whip, Toughness<br>19: Fighter(7)<br>20: Fighter(8): DEX+1, Expertise (DEX=23)<br>21: Ranger(9): Great Dexterity I (DEX=24)<br>22: Ranger(10): Favored Enemy: Aberrations<br>23: Ranger(11)<br>24: Shadowdancer(5): DEX+1, Great Dexterity II, (DEX=26)<br>25: Shadowdancer(6)<br>26: Shadowdancer(7)<br>27: Shadowdancer(8): Great Dexterity III, (CHA=27)<br>28: Shadowdancer(9): DEX+1, (DEX=28)<br>29: Ranger(12)<br>30: Shadowdancer(10): Epic Dodge<br>31: Fighter(9)<br>32: Fighter(10): DEX+1, Armor Skin, (DEX=29)<br>33: Fighter(11): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=30)<br>34: Fighter(12): Epic Weapon Focus: Whip<br>35: Fighter(13)<br>36: Fighter(14): STR+1, Self-Concealment I, Epic Weapon Specialization: Whip, (STR=13)<br>37: Fighter(15)<br>38: Fighter(16): Epic Prowess<br>39: Ranger(13): Self-Concealment II<br>40: Ranger(14): STR+1, (STR=14)<br><br><br>Vitals:<br>Hitpoints: 350<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Reflex/Will): 23/28/17<br>BAB: 29<br>AB (Naked): 40/35/30/25<br>AB (Mundane Whip): 43/35/30/25<br>AC (Naked): 28<br>AC (Clothing, Tower Shield): 31<br>Damage (Mundane Whip): 1-2 + 8<br><br>Skills:<br>Concentration 11<br>Discipline 43<br>Hide 43<br>Move Silently 43<br>Spellcraft 21<br>Spot 26<br>Tumble 33<br><br>Pros:<br>Good Naked AC; with some decent AC items, you can easily breach 50 AC<br>Average Hitpoints<br>Average AB; don't expect to go hit a Prismatic Dragon<br>Three Favored Enemies<br>Epic Dodge<br>Self-Concealment II<br>Hide in Plain Sight<br><br>Cons:<br>Low Will Save<br>Low Damage; anyone with decent slashing resist won't take much damage.<br><br>All in all, this was an attempt to make an accurate portrayal of a Belmont. The idea is to get a lot of AC items and become nigh unhittable. With +5 items, you can easily breach 50 AC. The will save seems to be the bane of all fighters, so some increased saving throw items would be very beneficial to this build. You should also look out for whips with elemental damage so you're not stopped dead in your tracks because you can't hit someone.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By To Nowhere on 04/15/07 04:52</span></i></p>

Be gentle, I don't know much.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Hmmmm, I guess you didn't understand exactly what I meant with Ranger...<br><br>What makes a Ranger specialize in killing enemies is this feat called <a href="http://www.nwnwiki.org/Bane_of_Enemies" target="_blank">Bane of Enemies</a>, as you are rigth now Ranger only gives you +3 damage against your Favored Enemies, Bane of Enemies grants you +2d6 damage against them and +2 AB, and the only requisite is ranger level 21, it's a great damage increase. At the same time you take too much Fighter levels, you don't need all the feats you took. You can get Bane of Enemies easily if you change Fighter levels for Ranger, for say Ranger 22 / Fighter 8 / Shadowdancer 10.<br><br>Stats, what happens is that any odd score becomes a wasted point when you cap an ability, since any ability can only be buffed to a maximum of +12, even if you don't cap them, having an odd score of INT is of no use since buffing INT won't help you, you need to make your scores even, simply put, drop one INT for one WIS, by the way, Rangers get a small amount of Divine Spells, up to level 4, so I recommend you to get 14 WIS so that you are able to cast them. Also, why do you increase STR at the end? it only increases damage by 1, so I think it's better to increase DEX for AB and AC.<br><br>Don't take Self Concealment feats, they're quite useless.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 04/15/07 17:05</span></i></p>

Told ya I'm new at this. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Yeah, I originally wanted to get Bane of Enemies, but I was also thinking Self Concealment would be a good idea, though it seems useless with my Epic Dodge. I took all the fighter levels hoping to get my damage higher because of how weak a whip is, but it didn't work to well. I'll edit the post soon with the changes you suggested, and we'll see how it ends up.
