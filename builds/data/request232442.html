I'm playing in a PW where +5 weapons are common with (at least) 2d4 elemental and 2d4 physical dmg. added to that. Very high magic world. I've heard that fighter-types are the best to use in high magic worlds. So, what's the best fighter-type out there? <br><br>There's also some restrictions on how you can take levels of certain classes...namely monk, paladin, and shadowdancer. For complete info on this go to mirellest.com, and look under rules/classes.<br><br>This is my first world to play on, and was chosen because my friends suggested it to me. I'd prefer an uber character to play on there, but suggestions of other worlds to try will be taken into consideration as well as other types of chars. besides fighter-types, but that would be my first preference.<br><br>Thanks,<br>-TopGun

The best fighter type? now you're not asking much do you?<br><br>There's no such thing as the perfect character, so to choose the best you will need to see which style you like the most.<br><br>Now, I haven't checked mirellest.com for detailed rules, but if you can't use Monk, Paladin nor Shadowdancer, you might as well go fine with a Fighter/Weapon Master, or some RDD too, might as well go fine with a Cleric buffer, but your definition is just too vague to give a direct answer.<br><br>But you should search for builds, it might be useful, use the <a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/search/builds.htm" target="_blank">search engine</a><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "229840", "15", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>This</a> is my fighter build that doesn't uses Monk, it's really good, both PvP and PvM (especially if you can keen the weapon), but I think there could be some stronger around there, guys around here really know how to build characters.

The rules aren't that restrictive. Look through the epic character builders forum that was already linked above. <br><br>For monks and paladins, the main thing is you can't go back and forth between them and other base classes, unless you keep them within 1 of each other, and you musttake at least 10 levels of them by level 30 (no taking just 1 level). They can freely mix with prestige classes.<br><br>So you may have to adjust the levelling order somewhat, but you can probably still use most of the paladin or monk builds that are heavy with pally or monk (but not the ones that just take a single Pal or monk level, or 6 or 9 monk levels). For example, you could use my Temple Guardian build, just modify the levelling order - instead of 16 monk then 4 fighter, take 2 monk, 3 fighter, then 2 more monk, then the 4th fighter level. Then monk to 20, then the CoT levels in epic. Or you could do it in any order if you drop fighter completely for CoT (but you lose WS/EWS that way).<br><br>The Temple Guardian build is a nice one for a solo character, and also makes a great support character for a party. If it is high magic, I recommend the kama version. For lower magic, I recommend the unarmed version.<br><br>For other melee builds, RDD is also restricted, so ignore Fighter/Bard/RDD builds unless you get DM permission first. <br><br>Any of the Fighter/WM or Fighter/WM/Rogue or Fighter/WM/Bard builds will be good in melee.<br><br>A fighter/DwD can be very tough, especially for dex-based opponents.<br><br>Fighter/Clerics are also very powerful melee characters, with nice healing and some offensive spellpower to boot.<br><br>If there are no items giving immunites to sneak attack, knockdown, and if True Seeing items aren't common, a Rogue/Fighter/SD build can be very powerful.<br><br>TM<br><br><br>In high magic settings, I don't recommend shifter builds.

Thanks for the help so far guys. Sorry for being so vague. Here are the rules...<br><br>1. Paladins: Paladins may freely multiclass with Fighter or Cleric as long as the Paladin levels are kept within 1 level of the other class. Alternately, paladins may switch to or from Paladin based upon Role play but must take at least 10 levels in paladin total (take 10 levels of paladin, then become a mage for example). Paladins that switch to a different (non prestige) class may no longer take levels in paladin. Allowed Prestige classes (may be freely taken at any time requirements are met): Champion of Torm (play as Divine Champion), Dwarven Defender, Weapons Master. <br><br>2. Monks: Monks may freely multiclass with any other available class(es) as long as the monk level is kept within 1 level of other class(es). Alternately one can take at least 10 levels in monk then switch to any other class, or may start off another class and switch to monk for at least 10 levels. Once switching to a different (non prestige) class monks may no longer advance in their monk level (ie, if you take 12 levels in monk and switch to rogue, you may not level up in monk again). Allowed Prestige classes: Any according to the requirements met. <br><br>3. General: Freely multiclass, (Red Dragon Disciple, and Psionicist require DM permission first). A minimum of 4 levels must be taken in the monk, paladin and shadowdancer classes by level 20 (Paladins and Monks must have 10 levels by 30). ALL CHARACTERS MUST HAVE A VALID RP REASON FOR TAKING A CLASS. <br><br>4. Paladins, Clerics, Druids, and Rangers all must select an appropriate deity to receive their spells, they must also be an allowed alignment for that deity, and the deity must allow followers of that class. Clerics should stick with domains allowed by their deity. All other classes are encouraged to pick a deity that suits their character’s background. <br><br>5. Red Dragon Disciple and Psionicist require DM approval before you take the class. <br><br>6. If you have taken the Psionicist class do not overuse the "Stasis Field" and do not use Dimensional Door to skip over any spawn triggers that you may OOCly know where they are. In the same way a Wizard is not to overuse the Timestop spell, using it is fine but using it 3 times in a row will only proceed to annoy the other players.<br><br> I do like the WM builds because the crits can be huge with the powerful weapons. I'm also partial to dual wielding scimitars (ya because of Drizzt), but not necessary if there's a more powerful build.<br><br> I should also mention the build should have most if not all of the good stuff by level 30, as to get xp after 30 is not based on killing stuff, but roleplaying.<br><br> I have read through a lot of the builds on the search engine prior to posting this...I think I'm just stuck on the perfect char.<br><br> Thanks again guys...keep em coming!<br><br>-TopGun
