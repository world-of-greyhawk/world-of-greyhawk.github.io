Seemingly <b>playable 1-40 PvM. PvP</b> too, you get full wizards arsenal and HiPS + epic dodge.<br>It would be wise to have companions at least in the low levels.<br><br>_______<br><br>Helgi sat under a bush feeding his Crow. Hugin was his ever alert crow companion, and a great scout. He was a Pukje, a creature mainly living below ground, usually surfacing only at night.<br>"So Magnar" he said to the big man approaching him "What brings you up here this fine evening?"<br>"Hi Helgi." the large man replied. "It's the Svea-men. They raided my farm while me and many warriors were away." "And what has that to do with me?" Helgi stated flatly "It's certainly not the first time." He seemed uninterested.<br>"They were driven back by my wife and the warriors left at home. But they got away with some loot. And even worse..." he paused for effect, but Helgi didn't even stir "they managed to take Jarl"<br>Helgi's eyes narrowed dangerously. "They have taken your son?" He asked.<br>"Yes, and worse." Magnar knew Helgi and his son Jarl were buddies. "It was Gauti Bloodthirsts men. His manpower is to high for me. He demands everything I have, including my land, to give him back."<br>"That darn Svea Earl. He has caused enough troubles. He killed my friend once, when I was a kid. Don't worry,  Magnar, I will get him out. And count on that darn province to get the earl they deserve."<br>"Thank you, Helgi, i will go with you." Magnar said, his eyes sparkling somewhat again.<br>"No way" the short one said "You will slow me down". He Galdered, a magic rhyme.<br><b>I sorely need lift.Bring me a wolf so swift</b>. Shortly after a wolf appeared, Helgi hopping on to it swiftly disappearing.<br><br>When he came to Earl Gautis House he quickly disappeared from sight. It was a minor illusion for him, not even requiring a rhyme. He approached his house and slipped in through the window. The guards posted inside had no clue he was there. A short while later he found Gautis room, his wife was there beside him. Helgi again whispered a mmagic rhyme.<br><b>For Sygun not to wake and weep, do keep her in her sleep.</b><br>There, that should do it. He pulled out his sword( a dagger to man) and put it to Gautis throat.<br>"Awake!" He said as loud as he could, and his dagger slighly pierced his throat, making a thin red line appear. "What is this?" Gauti said, suddenly awake. Fear showing in his eyes.<br>"If you are smart, do as I say or you will be dead in two seconds. Get dressed, then move out to your guards, release Jarl, and send with him and armed escort and this letter. Send the whole group to Magnar the Just to deliver the boy back.<br><br>Having no choice, Gauti dressed and went out to his men. Helgi invisible on his back with a dagger to his throat. The Earl had to repeat a few orders but they were followed, the armed group setting pace towards Magnars house. Once inside Helgi asked. "Isn't it so, that so long as you live, you are the ruler of this province? Only to be followed by your sons when you die?"<br>Gauti swallowed. "Yes. I will stalk you if you not kill me today. You will be repaid in kind!"<br>"I will not" Helgi said, jamming his dagger deep in Gautis heart. He screamed out in dying agony.<br>Helgi acted fast: <b>Let not Gautis soul to Helheim be lead. Let him remain as Earl undead.</b><br>Helgi was pleased. Gauti would become an undead. Not communicating or thinking, but still ruler of his land. How long until they decide to destroy him he wondered.<br><br>"Halt! Who are you little one?" Helgi turned around. 12 guards had come, hearing their masters scream. He had no time to become invisible, as it took a second or two. Likely they would nail him.<br>He whispered a magic rhyme again. <b>To get Helgi out of this mess, he needs a deep unyielding darkness.</b> The room turned completely black. He heard arrows whooshing through the air to where he had been standing. A creature of the darkness he didn't need light. He moved through the group, slashing legs and bodies of those who got to close. When he had passed them he turned, giving them a parting gift. <b>They did not harm me with their spears, still they need to face their fears.</b> He summoned illusions, one for each guard. They screamed in horror. It would not kill them, but they wouldn't sleep good in years after this.<br><br>He started on the road home, riding the wolf. His faithful bat flying along. "Tomorrow we will play again, Jarl" he said to himself "You have some galdring to be taught despite what your father says"<br>With a big grin he thought back on the Svea man, having a ruler who woould mostly just sit there, perhaps do some random wanderings.....<br>______<br><br>I have deep knowledge of Norse myths, and here is some info. Pukje(don't know what it is called in english) is a subterranean creature. Small of build, who are tricksters, using illusions. Utilising galdring, (one kind of Norse magic) the only magic types relevant is Necromance and Illusions, thats what i had in mind when doing this wizaed build. I think the D&amp;D gnomes might be based upon these creatures.<br><br>I have never played wizards in NwN before, so this is probably not to good.

Very neat build, Grim. I really like the story as well. Nice job. I haven't anything to add other than a couple points of interest:<br><br>you have 25 WIZ levels, so you can't be dispelled (although Mords can still strip your buffs). That's a big plus.<br><br>If you had all three Spell Pen feats, you could beat the default Spell Resistance every time.<br><br>It's a shame you can't get Epic Dodge a bit sooner, but you've decent spells to help keep you out of bad situations, so it's not an absolute must.<br><br>However, if you wanted to do it, you could take SD 5 earlier, as well as Rogue 10. Drop 1 WIZ level and take another (late) Rogue level instead. This would get you Epic Dodge earlier, but you'd be vulnerable to dispelling (albeit only on a 20 roll).<br><br>Anyway, I love the concept of this build. Kudos.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

Some very good advice there, i didn't even remember the dispel thing. Another rogue level would be nice, can get epic dodge quite early there. It will be more playable with that, i agree, than the even stream of skill dumps. When he is not so easily dispelled, that makes him better. The few tests I always run, he could master many situations very good, if you are well prepared. I will look into penetration after all, but the plan was to use Mord's. hmmmm.....<br><br>edit: For rp reasons, the familiar is a bat. In the story, i have written both bat and crow. Both would do, but bat is cave dwellers.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 10/28/05 14:33</span></i></p>

dispells work by rolling a d20 + level of dispell caster vs 11 + buff caster's level.<br><br>caps apply to the lesser and greater dispells<br><br>lesser has a +5 cap on the dispeller level so the max roll can be 25.  vs a lvl 15 buffer, this can't succeed since 11+15 &gt; 25.<br><br>greater has a +15 cap so the max roll is 35.  so a lvl 25 buffer will be immune since 11+25 &gt; 35.<br><br>It used to be the case that the dispell done by mord's disjunction was capped at +20.  In the old code you'd be immune to mord's dispell function at lvl 30.. again 11+30 &gt; 40 (max roll for dispell). <br><br>I checked the script again for mords and this cap has been removed (looked at v1.66).  So if a high level caster mords you it will be possible to dispell any of your buffs.  nobody can be immune to dispells completely anymore, since mords will always have a chance to work depending on the mord caster's level.<br><br>There is also a separate line of breach spells (lesser and greater).  these just auto dispell a list of buffs in order.  There is no dispell roll so you're always vulnerable.  If you want to be able for some of your buffs to survive a breach, it may be worthwhile to look at the order of the breach list in the spell script.  For example. you can cast both greater spell mantle and normal spell mantle if you wanted to keep your premonition and acid sheath, since both mantle spells are above the ones you want to keep in the breach list, etc...<br><br>all the breach spells also lower the sr of the target.<br><br>mords is a combo between dispell and breach.  it is an uncapped dispell, as well as a breach that strips 6 spells from the breach list (against single target) or 2 spells from each target in the area (if used a AOE).<br><br>pretty much as a caster you use the breach spells and not the dispell spells.  as a buffer you fear the breach spells and not the dispell spells unless you have a very low caster level.<br><br>edit: fixed mistake with greater dispell cap (thanks Cinn)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By jjjhhhlll on 10/28/05 16:06</span></i></p>

Sneaky wizards are pretty nice.<br><br>You don't technically need the penetration feats since if you use Mord's it will lower spell resist by 10 either as single target or as an area effect.  The drawback is mainly that you'll have to rest more often since every time you encounter magic-resistant enemies you will need to cast a 9th level spell.<br><br>But freeing up three feats is a reasonable tradeoff, all things considered.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
