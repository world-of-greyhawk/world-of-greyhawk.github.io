Ok Now I finished it its real good build works out to Barbarian 22 Fighter 18 Start as Human with This is apretty cool Achilles build but maybe it would be better to drop Dex to 12 and get an extra str point so I get the crit feats faster, then maybe I could not get dodge feat though but I actually did not get it anyway. Maybe I should try for no mighty rage and just do more fighter levels with more feats, but I think Migty rage is cool and You need 21 Barbarian levels to get I think. If I am wrong feel free to correct me though...<br><br>Akhilleus Chaotic Good Human Barbaarian 22 / Fighter 18<br><br>Str 14 +6 +5 I-V str feats (25)<br>Int 14<br>Con 14<br>Dex 14<br>Wis 10<br>Cha 12<br><br>"Each character gets one feat at 1st level.
