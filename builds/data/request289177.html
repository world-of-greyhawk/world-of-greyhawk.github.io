Hi All,<br><br>Trying to find a monk / DD / WM build for the server I run on. Was trying to get high damage resistance from the DD / high spell resistance from the monk / and some extra attack bonus from the WM. The server is a high magic one, attack bonus can go as high as +9 on weapons or gauntlets, any ability can be raised 12 with magic items. All classes and feats are allowed. I do not mind exp penalty, and to survive in PvP is a must. <br><br>Thanks for you assistance.

I dont see how you could get high DR, high SR, and the extra AB from WM all in one build. You would need like 20+ levels of Monk and 16+ levels to make WM worthwhile and 18+ levels of DD for a higher DR. I guess it depends on your definition of "high". There would be no exp penalty using this class split, as two of them are prestige classes.

Forget the WM. You are much better off using fighter.<br>4monk/6fighter/10DwD is pre epic.<br>18monk/8fighter/14DwD.

High magic? PVP? Then you'll no doubt be up against some pure(ish?) mages using items to seriously beef up their spell penetration. It's not worth taking monk for SR against those kind of enemies in that environment unless you're going to invest in a significantly large number of levels; Not an expert, but I'd say at least mid-20's to resist even a decent number of spells. Plus the problems that arise from doing so, your AB will be crippled by so many monk levels plus the high magic environment means there'll be some serious AC to take care of more then likely. And that's even without going for DwD damage resistance (which probably won't help much in a high magic environment since there's extra damage on everything).<br><br>IMHO, what you need is a nice taunter/KDer/ABer/damager to deal with anything mage-related rather than SR and APR in such a high magic environment. That being said, if there are items with a large amount of SR on them available, then fewer monk levels may be acceptable to augment it high enough to be effective, but I think an alternate route is still the best option.<br><br>Sorry if I seem negative, and it is one hour into Christmas here after all, bah humbug! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">

Awsome at one thing,<br>or pretty good at two,<br>or built only for PVM with three.

It's impossible to have high SR and DR in the same build, as galabriel clearly explained. I do believe Monk/Fighter/DwD is a better choice, but it is possible to get the DR with the WM critical range if that's what you're looking for, just don't even think about going for Dev Crit.<br><br>Now, to get real and get the most benefits of the classes possible you'd go best with heavy Dwarven Defender, or else DR is just a dream, you get most of Weapon Master with 7 levels and most of Monk with just one.<br><br>One problem here is Monk can't fill the requirements for WM until level 12 or Dwarven Defender until 10, so minimum Monk is 10 and BAB can't be improved. So here's what I would recommend [Monk 11 / Weapon Master 7 / Dwarven Defender 22]:<br><br>1 Monk1 - Dodge, Expertise<br>2 Monk2<br>3 Monk3 - Weapon Focus: kama<br>4 Monk4<br>5 Monk5<br>6 Monk6 - Mobility<br>7 Monk7<br>8 Monk8<br>9 Monk9 - Toughness<br>10 Monk10<br>11 Dwarven Defender1<br>12 Dwarven Defender2 - Spring Attack<br>13 Dwarven Defender3<br>14 Dwarven Defender4<br>15 Dwarven Defender5 - Whirlwind Attack<br>16 Dwarven Defender6<br>17 Weapon Master1<br>18 Weapon Master2 - Improved Critical<br>19 Weapon Master3<br>20 Weapon Master4<br>21 Weapon Master5 - Blind-Fight<br>22 Weapon Master6<br>23 Weapon Master7<br>24 Dwarven Defender7 - Epic Feat<br>...<br>...<br>...<br>37 Monk11 - skilldump Tumble<br>...<br>40 Dwarven Defender22<br><br>NOT TESTED, I HOPE THERE ARE NO ERRORS<br><br>It's incomplete because I'd need to know if you want EDR III or go all STR, so that affects the stat increases every 4 levels and the epic feats. You get 27 BAB with 6 base APR, all the WM critical goodness, and DR 15/-, the EDR route should get about 24 STR, the STR route might get it to about 30, but that's about the best you can do since going WM/DwD/Monk is very feat starved.<br><br>EDIT: Oh, and by the way, it's impossible to get XP penalty from Prestige Classes, so that's not an issue.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Hi All,<br><br>Thanks for all your inputs:<br><br>Thaxll'ssyllia  thanks for your effort, as for your question as to going EDR 3 or going Str build. I think EDR 3 may benifit me better. What would the starting stats be?<br><br>Thanks.

Monk 10 DD 26 Wiz 4 is nice.  3x EDR, some monk speed and abilities, heaps of True Strikes.  Make it a str-based build with a 2 handed weapon, and it does some decent damage.  On a high magic PW, having the Wiz 4 and 35ish ranks in spellcraft should help with scrolls and all that too.
