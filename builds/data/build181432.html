However, I don't really see the necessity of taking 21 Fighter levels. <br><br> If I were you, I would probably take more Rogue levels (at least 13), and pick up Epic Dodge.  With Epic Dodge plus the concealment from Empty Body, with your already high AC, you should be very difficult to hit.    <br><br>Also, I'm not sure I see the point of ending with 33 Dex.  Generally speaking, I try to end my stats on even #s, as you only get a bonus to your skills/abilities for every 2 points of any stat.  <br><br>BTW, there is a -4 penalty to AB for dual-wielding Rapiers, as opposed to a -2 penalty for shortswords.  There is of course no penalty for unarmed, but then you don't get quite as many attacks. <br><br> Rather than Rapiers, I would suggest dual-wielding Kamas.  Kamas use the Monk's attack table, meaning that if you dual-wield them you can get up to 10 attacks per round with Haste and Flurry of Blows.

Crispy.. I just have to say this once and for all.. PLEASE stop quoting the whole build.. we know what build you are refering to since you are posting right after it.. there is no other build mentioned.. its the build mentioned in the subject heading.  No offense. Thanks.<br><br>edit: Oh, and if you do it to just see the post while you are critiquing it, just open a new window or delete the quote after you're done writing.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DeathScytheDuo on 02/18/05 04:02</span></i></p>

On dualing Kama's.  You can hold any other weapon in your offhand without affecting your attack rate; I would suggest a Kukri or dagger depending on stats.  Why?  Kukri has a very high crit range; and is classed Light so no -4 loss to bab BUT you will need the Exotic feat to use it; dagger is also light, so no BAB penalty but you can use it without extra feats, iirc.

About that tumble thingy. <br><br>Dodge is good to have even when you max tumble. Dodge gains you +1 AC and it applies as well when you fight 1v1. +1AC can make a great deal of difference!<br><br>Weapons...hmm well Kaliban said it. Personal preference and what is best should always be kept in mind when choosing your weapon ^^<br><br>If the server has the same basic dmg on every single weapon, then i would take either kukris or kamas.

You could take Harper Scout instead of 4 fighter/1 Rogue at the end.This will make it possible to take more great DEX feats (I know that wasn't your intention <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  )

With max tumble, a melee fighter will never get attacks of opportunity from moving around (actually, once you have tumble of 14 you won't).  You'll only get it from something like drinking a potion in combat.  That's why people generally consider Dodge (as well as mobility) unnecessary if you have high tumble; You'll virtually never get any use out of having it.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 05/05/05 16:38</span></i></p>

I'm also skeptical that you would retain your monk attack table in your main hand if you have a non-kama weapon in your offhand.  I haven't tested it at all, but my instinct is that you lose your monk attack table entirely as long as you are wielding a weapon other than kama.<br><br><br>You attack schedule with short swords is a bit wrong as listed.  It would be 39/34/29/24 in the main hand, and 39/34 in the offhand (you gave yourself an extra attack at 29 instead of one at 24).  With rapiers, it's 37/32/27/22 and 37/32.  That's honestly quite low for a level 40 melee build.  The fact that rapiers have a broader crit range is largely irrelevant if your AB isn't high enough to capitalize on that.  You can't crit on a 15 if you can't hit without rolling a 20.  You may as well stick with kamas for slightly higher AB and the monk attack schedule.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 05/05/05 17:21</span></i></p>

Thanks all you guys for the help. Ive recently made i new build based on that one (keeping him essence - a melee fighter woth rogue skills and able to use scrolls) with your suggestions. I will post it as soon as I pass it all to the PC, maybe later today or tomorrow (Im very tired now =p) and hope you can help me again to fix the problems it may have.<br><br>cakerj
