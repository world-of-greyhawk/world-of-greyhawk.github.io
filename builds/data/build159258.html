This will give you more sneak attack without losing anything since the feats you gain with 5 sd you can get using bonus rogue feats.  Also in terms of min maxing it would be better to spend the 2 chr points into something else.  A 1 modifier will very rarely help you with a roll, while, for example, another +2 strength would give you a consistant bonus to dmg.<br>Something to definetly change is to have any leveling pre epic to be taken in multiples of 4.  If you take my suggestion on level distribution you could go 16 monk/4 rogue pre epic and take the SD level at 21.  You get hips later, but gain some very much need ab.

Also I'd take Rogue rather than Monk first level for 16 additional skill points. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

I'm studying the version 20/1/19 and looks nice. I take the SD feats from the rogue extra feats as you said.<br><br>About the leveling I have to say:<br><br>- 1st lvl must be monk for roleplaying reasons (yes, I know the loose of skill points but he begins as just a humble monk <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  )<br><br>- As it is a char to be played since the beginning in a PW, I think I have a better broad of skills leveling as I did, rather than waiting to epic to get my third class.<br><br>If I fully develop the new version I'll post it, but at the moment I'm working on a fighter tank and probably won't have time for both builds.
