Well... there's just something funny about a 50 foot tall dragon disappearing right in front of your very own eyes.<br><br>It's a tank druid build that concentrates on AB and AC (well, and hiding) although does pretty well as a spellcaster too.  Played as a regular caster druid up until early epics where you take your first monk level and a level of shadowdancer and you can start shapeshifting while using all the monk and SD cheese.<br><br>It's a great super-low magic build since you don't need any items compared to most other classes.<br><br>It's playable (and does well) in both PvP and PvM.<br><br>Human, Lawful Neutral<br><b>Sneaky Dragon</b> - Druid 33/Monk 1/Shadowdancer 1<br>Playable 1-40<br><br>STR 8<br>DEX 14<br>CON 10<br>WIS 18 (32)<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8<br><br>1.

Ooops, missed Barskin <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_redface.gif">   <br><br>It's 77 instead of 78 AC because I also used Blood Frenzy to help max out on strength.  If you can do it with an item, another +1 AC since you don't need to cast it.<br><br>I thought about 4 monk pre-epic, but IMO it makes you a worse caster since at level 20 you only have 16 levels of druid.  And I usually play this build as if it were a standard caster, concentrating on slowing down opponents, bombarding them with damage spells and having Winnie the Pooh to finish the job.<br><br>Good point on a bear (it's actually 31 strength), it's a great strategy for really low levels but in my experience the AC is usually too low to stay healthy and tank in late teens (around 40 or so with no items)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bertuzzi on 01/06/09 08:52</span></i></p>

Hey Bertuzzi,<br><br>Nice build! I like that guy! Could that be the remaking of Thaxll'ssyllia, the Shadow Dragon? <br><br>I have a few questions for you, however:<br><br>1- Why take Dodge and Mobility so early on if you're only going to get SD at level 23?<br><br>2- Why get knockdown if Monk 6 will give it to you for free? Why not drop Toughness and Knockdown and get Disarm / Improved Disarm? If you're going to level up as a Druid it really shouldn't be that hard to cruise through your early levels. IMO they're the easiest class to level with.<br><br>3- Why not get 30 levels of Druid and 4 of Shadowdancer? Sure you'll lose an epic feat, but Wis 31 is the same as 32 cuz you can cap it with owl's insight, right? Then you get Darkvision, Uncanny Dodge, Shadow Daze and Shadow evade. Hmm Yummy!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>4- Why not get Epic Prowess earlier on? Maybe swap it for Epic Fortitude?<br><br>Nice buffed Hide / MS modifiers, scary! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   <br><br>Take it EZ!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Maximillian Kane on 01/06/09 08:53</span></i></p>

Maximillian:<br><br>1.  They help around during earlier levels, since you'll likely be running around a lot and hence, taking attacks of opportunity.<br><br>But in reality feat order doesn't matter very much - it's a personal choice for most players.  For example, when playing bard/BG/RDD most players take RDD pre-epic... I choose to only take 4 BG levels and go for Lasting Inspiration at level 24.<br><br>2.  Waiting until level 40 to get KD is a pain in the butt.  And besides, there's nothing to take pre-epic except Maximize Spell.  Disarm won't work very well - your AB is decent enough to hit from stealth, but it's not high enough to get past the discipline skill of most dedicated meleers, especially on medium magic worlds and higher.  Also, I'm not sure if the monk unarmed disarm feature works in dragon shape..<br><br>3.  Two reasons.  The first one is to get the caster level as high as possible to avoid dispel (it's a PvP build).  The second one is that 32 vs. 31 WIS is +1 AC, +1 DC, a couple of extra spell slots and +1 will.  Also, uncanny dodge doesn't really work.  Other SD abilities aren't that useful.<br><br>4.  Personal choice mostly.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Take it EZ!</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Thanks! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bertuzzi on 01/06/09 09:02</span></i></p>

Grimnir77<br><br>If you think Wisdom is that important then you could drop Epic Fortitude instead of Great Wisdom and therefore keep your capped stat at 44. All I'm saying is that his lowest save is reflex, and Uncanny Dodge would be nice to have. Is it really that different a caster level of 33 VS one of 30 in terms of dispellability? I mean with 30 Caster levels you can already count yourself immune to everything but Mordenkainen's Disjunction and Spell Breach (es), and you can't resist Breaches, so basically it's all about Mord's. IMO you get enough in exchange to make it worth the trade.<br><br>I like Shadow Evade because it can give you +1 to AC to make up for the Blood Frenzy loss. Damage reduction is useless, and concealment isn't high enough to bother with, although still better than nothing <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> . Plus you get Darkvision on SD 2, which I think is cool. If it were possible, I'd even squeeze in another SD level for Defensive Roll.<br><br>I would still go for disarm. If the target is knocked down first, you may disarm them with a bonus, which can make it harder to resist. Also, you're not considering the alternative. It's not like Toughness is the best feat in the world, and you're already getting Knockdown anyway, so in terms of level 40 power the net loss is 0 and you gain a useful feat. If you REALLY don't like Disarm feats, you can still get something else, and you don't even have to drop Toughness. Hell, you could even get Luck of Heroes <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> .<br><br>Take it EZ!

I've never been killed by a Devastating Critical while in Dragon Shape. Dragons have high CON and Druids get Fortitude as high save so your Fortitude is actually much higher than average. By the way, taking a Monk level pre-epic will increase all your saves, you didn't thought about that right? No matter what spread you have, a Monk level pre-epic always increases your saves. 2 Monk levels add +3 to all saves, compared to +1 Fortitude and Will you'd get from increasing Druid from 18 to 20.

@ Bertuzzi<br><br>Yes, OF COURSE I meant the Shadowdancer Shadow Evade DR. Comon man, I may be a noob but I'm not BRAINLESS (shame on you and Thax <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> )!<br><br>@ Thax<br><br>I suggested that he should go Druid 30 / SD 4 / Monk 6. Forgive me for liking SD bonus feats. I think Darkvision would make it worth the trade. And if you could find a way to squeeze in another SD level (maybe dropping Monk to 2 and getting IKD instead of Toughness for example, since you're already wasting a feat on KD there's no real reason to go Monk 6. That way you could keep the high Caster Level), you can get Defensive Roll, which is awesome!<br><br>Basically. Going 2 monk pre-epic (at least) would really improve your cause, I agree with that. The thing I dislike the most here is the fact you're getting Monk 6 AND wasting a feat on KD. To me they're mutually exclusive. If you go Monk 6, don't get KD and vice-versa. I think your situation would improve quite a bit if you went Druid 1-19, Monk 1 (not necessarily in that order), SD 5, Druid 33, Monk 2 (skill dumps). HiPS is very cool, but not the only useful SD feat. Defensive Roll could really improve your cause, since you'll have a HUGE Dex score on DS (although it's really hard to imagine a Dragon rolling <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> )<br><br>Take it EZ!

What's so great about Darkvision?  <br>I've never heard someone argue that "Darkvision is worth a trade off."  <br><br>Druids can cast Ultravision, which is much better.  <br><br>Monk six also provides Improved Knockdown, so it's not like he'd be getting "nothing" for taking that many levels.

If he dropped Toughness (which we can agree is useless), he'd be able to get IKD anyway.

Never thought of it that way (dropping 4 monks to get an extra 3-4 druids).<br><br>However defensive roll is useless as of 1.69.

Hmmmmm, anyway, if I'm correct, you still won't get a bonus AB when making a Knockdown attempt even if you're supposed to when attempting to KD a small enemy.

I'll revise the build and probably post another version here.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bertuzzi on 01/09/09 02:43</span></i></p>

Don't mean to be drudging up old posts and all but I do have a question.  How is it that you have yourself getting 72 AC?<br><br>The armor I'm using is a +5 robe, helmet is a +5 STR helm, and the shield is a +5 tower shield.<br><br>I'm also using barkskin, owl's insight and aura of vitality to buff my ac.  I am using other buffs but they do not contribute to AC so i won't bother listing them. <br><br>All this together and I'm only reaching a total of 63, so where am i missing AC at?

Let's count all up.<br><br>Human:<br>10 Base<br>+1 Monk level 5<br>+8 Tumble<br>+11 Wisdom (32 base)<br>+2 DEX (14 base)<br>+2 Armor Skin<br>---------------<br>34<br><br>Dragon Shift<br><br>+20 for being dragon (Dodge AC)<br>+11 DEX (going from 14 to 36)<br>-2 Size<br>---------------<br>63<br><br>The Character Sheet forgets to reduce the size modifier, so it's really 63, not 65 like it says.<br><br>Buffed<br><br>+2 Aura of Vitality (DEX buff)<br>+6 Owl's Insight (WIS buff)<br>+5 Barksin (Natural AC)<br>------------<br>76<br><br>Items<br><br>+5 Armor merges (Armor AC, shield + helm + armor do NOT stack)<br>-------------<br>81<br><br>The Character sheet would normally add up your Haste AC but Dodge is already capped so it's a fake bonus. So the Character Sheet should show 83 and 87 with Haste, wehereas both cases are really 81.<br><br>I think that's the correct AC roundup. Bertuzzi said he used Blood Frenzy so lower AC by 1 to get his stats. His real buffed AC with no items should be 75.<br><br>At 63 you're 18 points below from my calculations, I don't know how, but the only thing that I can think of that reduces your AC by exactly 18 is if you didn't take Monk. You'd lose the AC from Monk level 5 and 17 from the buffed Wisdom of 44. I haven't tested this in version 1.69 (as I actually no longer play NWN, I just post here) but perhaps wearing the shield, which nullifies the Monk's AC, is getting carried over to the shift. That or your server is hacked, you could be reading the character sheet at 63 if your server discounted the +20 Dodge of the dragon form without taking into account the size modifier, that would show 63 in the Character Sheet. Seriously though, I have no idea how you get 63.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 10/05/09 00:37</span></i></p>

Well, when you reminded me of the AC bonus from the shape I realized that the stats for dragon shape were changed on my server to balance things more, dragons only get +10 AC and their dex is only 26 as opposed to 32, other stats were changed to but as we are discussing AC those are the pertinent issues.  <br><br>However, on the server they made it so that ac from different armor types such as natural wouldnt just be turned to deflection. So thanks for helping me answer my own question <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

A gigantic shadow descended upon the company of heroes. They turn around...only to see a large reptillian shadow disappear into the crimson sunset...leaving behind Bob's bloody body...<br><br>I love hide in plain sight for dragons (^_^)<br><br>Hm...personally i don't think 6 lvls of monk is worth the Improved Knockdown. Being a dragon, you're big enough for just knockdown <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>I had tried Druid 37/Monk 1/shadowdancer 2 (for the uncanny dodge, my only complaints were that it can't get through small corridors and can't deal enough damage...... hmm.... actually it does quite a bit of damage...<br><br>So that build versus my recent dragon build is mainly a tradeoff between rakshasa shape and hips...for me, i see true seeing everywhere (0.0), so i went for rakshasa shape.<br><br>Of course, in light of constructive criticism, lots of druid levels along with 'spell resistance' buff = caster worst fear (^_^). Even if they are a mostly pure caster with Mork's Disjunction, it's around 50/50 dispel chance, and even if they fully dispel you, you'd just walk over and knockdown, and eat lunch (^_^). Sorcerer/Paladin/Blackguard would probably counter the knockdown with those ridiculously high saves, epic warding is a pain, but they don't have evasion so just breath fire (^_^). Also, true seeing is likely to come from casters, so your hips is not compromised (unless it's another dragon), so hipsing dragon build is winning my favor. I've never played multiplayer before though; if one guy is true seeing, can everyone else can see the enemy?<br><br>If not...what could kill a hipsing dragon...with heal potions...and haste for running away?...*smirk*
