The "trick" with this build is that you can totally neglect Dexterity and still use the Dual-Wield from the Ranger class.  Your Wisdom will provide the AC that you aren't getting from Dexterity. Also, instead of taking Favored enemies at Ranger levels 1 &amp; 5, I took combat feats as I thought they would be better served.<br><br>These exploits have been used before in other builds, but they are usually Dex-based, and I wanted to mix it up with using Ranger to keep the strength high.  This particular class mix was only used one other time, and it was very different from this.<br><br>I only took enough Wisdom to equal the AC of full plate (26) and put the rest into Strength.  You will be boosting both Dex, Wisdom and Strength for some nice bonus' to AC and AB.<br><br>It would be prudent to stay in Plate and use a shield until you get to near epic levels, where your boosted Wisdom and Dexterity will outperform Plate armor.  At that point, throw on some robes, grab some Kama's and let the fun begin!<br><br>You will only beat SR of 28, but that isn't really what this build is about.  With 26 Cleric levels, your buffs will be un-dispellable, however, with a decent natural strength and high natural wisdom, you shouldn't be dead in the water even if you find yourself in combat without them.<br><br>Weak points:<br>- Dual-Wielding comes very late<br>- Low non-buffed AB<br>- XP penalty from level 26 on<br>- Your colleagues won't respect you  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>About the Domains...<br>I chose War basically for the spell Cat's Grace to help boost AC.  Travel was taken for Haste. If you know that you will have access to Perma-haste, then I would take Trickery for the spell Improved Invisiblity (50% concealment).<br><br>Actually, with the Divine Power affect on the Monk attack schedule, I'n not exactly sure if you even need Haste to get the maximum allowable attacks per round (10).  If anyone can confirm it, I would love to know.<br><br>Anyway, it's as cheesy as it gets.... <br><br>Cheers.

It's a nice build, but why go with 24 STR/26 WIS instead of 30 STR/20 WIS?<br>_________________<br>"We keep our Feast of Feasts, sure of our bourne,<br>                 Our aims self-same:<br>The Guest of Guests, friend <i>Zarathustra</i>, came!<br>The world now laughs, the grisly veil was torn,<br>And Light and Dark were one that wedding-morn."

A wisdom of 26 (+8 modifier) is the same as full plate.  Your right, though.

Great build.  It's funny, just the other day I put together a build with almost this exact levelling priority, but my PW rewards taking more levels in a single class so I redesigned it to get 30 cleric levels (ended with cleric 30/monk5/rogue5).<br><br>Well thought out and tough.  Nice work.<br>_________________<br>Favorite PW's: Hall of the Worlds, Higher Ground, World of Iniquity.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By chsmi on 06/27/06 17:54</span></i></p>
