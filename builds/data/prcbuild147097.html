There was once a time long before the civilization became civilization, long before the elementals ruled the earth, sky, fire, and water. This is the legend of when the elementals were in infancy, long before new era of elements.<br><br>The legend begins...<br><br>Hand rose through the earth, seemly to reach out to the sky, but arched toward the earth like it was going back where it came from. The hand is so massive that it can destroy thousands of armies; it flexed itself and rolled into fist. The fist pounded into the earth, sending out tidal waves, toppling forests and mountains. The hand gathered the felled forests and rocks from destroyed mountains and placed it on the ground. The hand then retreated back into the earth that created it. The sky and water gathered together to create thunderstorm... the storm thundered and poured rain down upon the earth, which the hand came from, water mixed with the mixture of the felled forest and rocks. Once the rain stopped, the sky thundered once more and lightning struck out and burned the surrounding air and struck the earth. Out of the struck earth, a new being arose, created by the elemental gods themselves, The Elemental Antecedent.<br><br>The Elemental Antecedent means "One that precedes elementals"<br><br>The Elemental Antecedent is supposed to be the very first elemental form born of earth... Many claims that they have seen this being roaming throughout the land, but many dismisses it since there hasn't been any since the end of the elemental's era.<br><br>==Leveling Instruction==<br>Name:

Spellsword for which it depends on strength to use weapon. But that is only for as back-up, it mainly relies on the wizard's spells. The spells should <br><br>make up for low stats in strength and constitution, they can be increased either by the epic spells learned in the laboratory or by spells that you can learn through scrolls.<br><br>The reasons for the skill points in many areas that seems not to apply to this build is that I had large amount of extra, so why not put them into craft ***, you could craft things for other character if you were to <br><br>team up with someone, such as fighter, you can craft weapon and enchant it for them. Or with rogue, you can make traps for them, and so on...<br><br>I believe this build can be improved more, probably weapon focus and few things. Since this build is based on earth form, you could take weapon focus (unarmed strike) for better damage. However, I welcome any feedback on this.<br><br>Thank you in advance.<br><br>Anuis<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Anuis on 08/10/04 22:12</span></i></p>

What's your final skill levels at. From what I can see you may have trouble with a lot of the higher end epic spell's DC checks.

Maybe switching out your simple and martial weapon feats for exotic would be better. That way you can use a bastard sword or katana for one feat instead of two feats like you have it. <br><br>/ed Of course that would screw up your spellsword prereqs. Doh. You could swap out spellsword levels with eldritch knight levels though and only need the martial weapon prereq to qualify instead of all the armor feats and the simple weapon feat.<br><br>I would swap out the reg skill focus spellcraft for epic skill focus though. You don't need the one as a prereq for the other.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Emrill on 08/10/04 22:53</span></i></p>
