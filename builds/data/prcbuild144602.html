Hi all! Anuis has nicely made me a moderator of this forum <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>In case some of you are curious what the PRC is <a href="http://nwnprc.netgamers.co.uk/index1.html" target="_blank">Click Here</a>; there is a link where to download it, and the jist of what we are. We were also featured by BioWare not long ago <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/players/profile_player_resource_consortium.html" target="_blank"> Here</a><br><br>For information on the classes, spells, skills, etc, go <a href="http://nwnprc.netgamers.co.uk/manual/index.html" target="_blank">here </a><br><br>This forum is for PRC builds <b>only</b>; any other builds will be deleted or moved. These do <b>not</b> necessarily have to use the PRC classes. They can just merely use one or some of the new feats, or some of the new class features implemented by the PRC.<br><br>I will be slowly moving over some of the builds from our forums over here, though most of them aren't really written up properly. Eventually I hope to see clearly written out builds, like we see on the BioWare contest (who knows, maybe one day we'll get some PRC builds featured)<br><br>Thanks, and have fun <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br>~ Lock.<br>_________________<br>"Life builds you up just to tear you down." - 3rd Strike<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Lockindal on 11/06/04 16:48</span></i></p>

Lockindal,<br><br>Is there any chance of getting manual like <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/other/data/1071619119750.shtml" target="_blank">Neverwinter Grimoire</a> for the PrC classes?<br><br>I have found that manual easy to use, so it would be great if same can be done for the PrC classes. It is easy to look at every builds that exist and look at the requirements, feats that it gets for free, etc etc. Then with that, if you don't know what the feat does, you can select the feat on the side column(bookmarks) to see what it is, etc.<br><br>The Neverwinter Grimoire manual is more accurate than the standard manual. I recommend that everyone use this for when they are doing standard class build(not PrC builds).<br><br>Anuis
