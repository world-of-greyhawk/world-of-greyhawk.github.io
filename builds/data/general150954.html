<b>I'm building a shifter. For SotU, taht means the max level is 24 or so correct?</b><br><br>If you mean the max possible amount of XP gained by playing, then it could be around that level yes. Still you should be able to make level 40 when playing other modules if I'm correct.<br><br><br><b>What is difference between getting a high level druid and high level shifter??</b><br><br>A high level druid can cast more/stronger/better spells, and has stronger elemental forms. A high level shifter I don't know exactly, but I believe it doesn't offer much more after level 16, perhaps your shapes will be a little stronger, but besides that I don't know.

A must read for any shifter out there is this FAQ link.<br><br><a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/game/34934.html" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br>It will tell you what epic shifter level to be for epic forms.  It also explains how the shifter level affects your DC rating on special attacks.<br><br>So follow the link and read the Shifter FAQ entry.<br><br>As far as who is better, a high level druid or a high level shifter, that is very dependent on play style.  You will not be casting many spells when shifted Ice Storming Raksasha being the exception.  Your druid spells will be for some buffs.<br><br>A level of Monk will yield some nice returns for AC and feats, multiples of 4 levels pre epic will be better for your AB.

In one of my shifter builds (Druid 21/Shifter 17/Monk 2) I have the choice between an Epic Spell and Armor Skin, which one do you guys think would be better?<br><br>- Armor Skin would get me 2 more AC for a total of 31<br><br>- Epic Spell would get me a nice damage spell (e.g. Hell Ball) for weakening opponents<br><br>A third option would perhaps be Epic Prowess.

I would go with the armor skin myself. Epic spells are very useless outside the PRC ones in the basic NWN game. The only two epic spells worth a damn are warding and mage armor. Some other things to keep in mind when building a shifter, is that most of the forms special abilites have a DC difficulty based on your shifter class lvel. Some also have a power based on your combined shifter/druid levels (like dragon shapes breat)<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Armor skin or epic prowess.  Armor skin is the better option, in my opinion, but if you really need the AB, there it is.<br><br>Epic spells are kinda nice in the sense that you can use them while shifted (kobold with hellball anyone?), but remember that you can be blasting them with 24d10 dragon breath all day long if you really wanted to.<br>_________________<br>"Intelligence is knowing a tomato is a fruit; Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad."

I'm curious if anyone has tried making a Minotaur shpe focussed build. I've tried, but having a hard time. I wanted to use barbarian for the rage feats mixed with minimal druid say 5 maybe 6 levels. Anyone want to take a stab at it? Or also  I've thought about going for epic drow shape focussed build.<br><br>                           Thanks, Mano
