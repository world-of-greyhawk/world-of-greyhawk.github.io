Nice build overall.  Good AB, early epic dodge, good use of classes to support evil FR-based rp angle.  I have a few tweaks to improve playability and a few small power boosts in my opinion, feel free to ignore if you'd rather.<br><br>I'd switch power attack to level 1, weapon finesse to level 3, weapon focus to level 9, and dodge to level 12.  This will let you get your dex bonus to AB as early as possible and improve your AB with your focused weapon earlier.<br><br>I'd try to find some stat points for con.  Maybe drop wisdom to 8... not good to take a save penalty but will is the easiest save to cover with buffs and items, and extra hitpoints are always good.  I'd likewise strongly consider replacing improved critical with toughness - you'll already be capable of dealing a lot of sneak attack damage to enemies who aren't immune to criticals.  Combined these moves would get you 80 more hitpoints at level 40, not shabby at all.<br><br>Alternatively, maybe improved critical could be better-replaced with knockdown, so that you can get mid-battle sneaks more easily.  In fact I'd probably say this is the better path all told, I like hitpoints, but sneak attackers without knockdown can be sad pandas.<br><br>You can change level 36 to blackguard and 37 to Assassin and skill dump tumble.  This lets you get tumble 40 as soon as possible for the last AC point.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   You don't need to take tumble to 43, the AC bonus works off unmodified ranks.<br><br>Self concealment 1 might not be worth it, since you have the improved invisibility assassin ability which is better (50% conceal compared to 10%), and the ghostly visage assassin ability which provides the same concealment.  If you can get another feat there (maybe even improved sneak attack or something) it might be a better investment... depends on how often you can (or want to) rest to some degree.<br><br>Since you are taking EWF and Epic Prowess on character feat levels, I'd move them up - take EWF at 27 and EP at 30, then put your great dex feats in later.  It's simply a playability boost - you get more AB out of those feats than you do out of great dexes.<br><br>Concentration only helps this character resist Taunts... I'm not sure you really need it.  Crossclassing those points into Spellcraft might help your saving throw outlook, on the other hand.<br><br>Good build overall.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

yea, the switching of those feats was actualy ment to be that way, just forgot to change it in notepad b4 posting it here.<br><br>Dropping Wisdom to 8 gives u an even weaker willsave whitch this build cant afford. but iv thought of maybe dropping the dex to 30 or 28 for more con. but i thought that it wasnt necceserry as not much can hit this build anyway due to the high ac.<br><br>The IC can ofcourse be changed to toughness, and yea now when i think about it (made this build in like 5 mins time) it might be a pretty good idea.<br><br>The reason for last lvl as Assassin and not at lvl 37 is that i wanted capped Hide, Move Silently and UMD skill. the 3 extra points went to tumble as i had nowhere els to put em, but ofc u can spend those on trap skills or open lock if ya want.<br><br>Ever thought of facing a foe who got dispell? a lvl 14 Imp Inv can be dispelled kinda easy and in that case, self conceal helps as its permanent.<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By arvut on 06/22/06 01:03</span></i></p>

SC1 is never, ever worth it. Anything below SC4 isn't, and I don't even like that.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

yea, the build is tested for pvp, not for pvm tho, forgot to add that.<br><br>the SC can be useful and i thought it was a good choice as i had a free feat, but yes, ISF can be quite nice aswell. those other feats, well feel free to change em if u would like to, but that changes the whole build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">
