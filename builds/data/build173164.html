<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>Here's a tanker I worked up who's sole purpose is to shield a mage and take the hits while the spellcaster blasts from the rear.<br><br>His base HP's (as I rolled them) are 839. In Defensive Mode (available 14 times per day) his HP's jump to 919 and his naked AC goes from 17 to 21. He has Damage Reduction of 27/-. <br>Thanks to his Champion of Torm levels, his gets +2 to all saving throws. He has Iron Will and Epic Will to shield from mind attacks.<br>Although primarily defensive in nature, The Wizard's Bulwark has Epic Weapon Focus and Epic Weapon Specialisation with his weapon of choice, giving him +3 to hit and +6 damage when wielding that weapon. In addition, he has Epic Prowess, granting him +1 to hit with any weapon.<br><br>Feedback, suggestions for improvement and criticism are welcome and encouraged.<br><br>One thought I had was to reduce Defender levels to 26 (since DwD 28 gives nothing special) and raise CoT levels to 6 giving +3 to all saves.<br><br>Thoughts?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban.<br><br><br>The Wizard’s Bulwark - Fighter 8/CoT 4/DwD 28<br>Race: Dwarf <br>Alignment: Lawful Good <br><br>Stats (At level 4 bump Dex, all other bonuses go to Con)<br>Str - 16<br>Dex - 12 (13)<br>Con  - 18 (30)<br>Int - 14<br>Wis - 8<br>Cha - 6<br><br><br>1 - Fighter 1 - Toughness, Weapon Focus: Warhammer<br>2 - Fighter 2 - Knockdown<br>3 - Fighter 3 - Power Attack<br>4 - Fighter 4 - Weapon Spec: Warhammer<br>5 - Fighter 5<br>6 - Fighter 6 - Dodge, Cleave<br>7 - Fighter 7<br>8 - CoT 1<br>9 - CoT 2 - Imp.
