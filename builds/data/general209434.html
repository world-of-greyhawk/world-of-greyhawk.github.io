I've been working with Cinnabar Din's lovely Dwarven Master of Resistance on a world where I was required to take 6 levels of any one class before adding another class.  While working out my own plan of advancement, I encountered a huge HP boost at RDD 10.  I know the information is probably out there somewhere on the Bioware board, but my first few searches didn't drop anything useful so I thought I'd ask the experts on builds.  Where did all the extra (more than 20, the highest I rolled before stopping to look for an answer was 39) HP come from, and what number should I be adding to the maximum possible of 16 (10 + 6 from CON) when taking that level?  This was at Fighter 8/Bard 6/RDD 10.<br><br>Thanks.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.drislink.com/slink/index.htm" target="_blank">Slink's Burrow Online</a>

What was important was that it was character level 24.  Assuming you kept all the stat boosts the same as Cin has it, at level 24 (which is where you would have been taking that RDD level), you increased your CON to 22.  Since your modifier went up to 6, that gains you an extra hit point for every single level you have, not just your current one.  Whenever your CON modifier goes up one, you get 1 more hp/level.  So, that's 23 hit points from your previous levels on top of your HP gain for the current level.  On your current level, the maximum you can get is 10 + 6 (from CON 22) + 1 (from toughness) = 17, so the max increase in hit points after this level would be 40.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 08/21/05 17:52</span></i></p>
