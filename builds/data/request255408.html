ok....<br><br>I recently aquired some incredibly powerful gloves on the server that I play on that allow for a +10 ab bonus.<br><br>For a little more than a week now I have been playing with various builds and looking through the search engine but cant find a build that fits what I need.<br><br>Most of the bigger creatures on the server are immune to crits and sneak attacks, so I cant have a build that relies on either of those. Most also have True Seeing which cuts out sneakers completely.<br><br>My vision is more or less as high of an Attack Bonus as I can get while hopefully haveing enough ac to not be pummeled to a crisp.<br><br>On the server I have access to max ability modifiers as well as +6 to Armor Class equipment.<br><br>Other than that pretty much any class will do as long as the end result pans out to what the above conditions portray.<br><br>P.S. Epic Dodge would be nice if possible<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By sarge525 on 10/11/06 21:51</span></i></p>

Hmm, Monk 25/Bard 5/RDD 10 (STR based) or Monk 20/Cleric 15/SD 5 (DEX based with ED) are nice, classical builds. Might also consider Monk 25/SD 5/Ftr 10 or somesuch. Use Sorc if you can't use Bard.<br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 10/11/06 21:59</span></i></p>

I should have also mentioned (slipped my mind) that many creatures either debuff you when you hit them or have weapons that do the same, makeing it pretty tough on clerics.<br><br>I will give both of those a run though and see if I can make one work.<br><br>And alighnment change is not an option.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By sarge525 on 10/11/06 22:02</span></i></p>

I went with 29monk/1sorc/10RDD on the one I just went through<br><br>I max out at 60ab with 38 base strength, does that sound about right or have I done something incorrectly?<br><br>As for the extra feats, they are always good but even without it I was able to get all the vital feats + 1 epic toughness
