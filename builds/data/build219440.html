Lone Harper (Rogue 29/Fighter 6/Harper 5)<br><br>Ok this is my first build here, so not sure if it’s been done before. The idea of this build is to get Epic Dodge and SC5 as early as possible. The reason behind this is that for the PW I play on I always try to get my build to Finish around 32-35 the rest after this is just a bonus. I don’t like my build to finish as 39 or 40 as I usually stop playing them when I reach 40. I’ve done this build as Elf, but one thing with the PW I play on is that they have a Human subrace – Teifling, this give you +2 Dex, +2 Int and -2 Cha a couple of Resits and  Favored class Rogue, also a +1 level adjustment.<br><br><b>playable from level 1 - 40 PvM</b><br><br>Race: Elf<br>Any non-evil  <br>Rogue 29<br>Fighter 6<br>HS 5<br><br>Str 10<br>De 20 (+2 race) finishes at 34<br>Con 12 (-2 race)<br>Int 14 <br>Wis 8<br>Cha 8<br><br><br>lvl 1  Rogue 1 - Alertness <br>lvl 2  Fighter 1 - Weapon Finesse (Fighter)<br>lvl 3  Fighter 2 - Weapon Focus (Rapier) &amp; KD (Fighter)<br>lvl 4  Fighter 3 - <br>lvl 5  Fighter 4 - Weapon Spec (Fighter)<br>lvl 6  Rogue 2 - Iron Will<br>lvl 7  Rogue 3 -<br>lvl 8  Rogue 4 -<br>lvl 9  Rogue 5 - Imp KD<br>lvl 10 Rogue 6 -<br>lvl 11 Rogue 7 -<br>lvl 12 Rogue 8 - Imp Crit<br>lvl 13 Rogue 9 - <br>lvl 14 Rogue 10 - Imp Evasion (Rogue)<br>lvl 15 Rogue 11 - Blind Fight<br>lvl 16 Rogue 12 -<br>lvl 17 Rogue 13 - Defensive Roll (Rogue)<br>lvl 18 Rogue 14 - Toughness<br>lvl 19 Rogue 15 - (Make sure you have your Skills for HS)<br>lvl 20 Fighter 5 - <br>lvl 21 Rogue 16 - Great Dex 1 &amp; Epic Dodge (Rogue)<br>lvl 22 Harper 1 – Great Dex 2 (HS)<br>lvl 23 Harper 2 -<br>lvl 24 Harper 3 - Great Dex 3<br>lvl 25 Harper 4 - <br>lvl 26 Harper 5 – Great Dex 4 (HS)<br>lvl 27 Rogue 17 - SC 1<br>lvl 28 Rogue 18 -<br>lvl 29 Rogue 19 - SC 2 (Rogue)<br>lvl 30 Rogue 20 - SC 3<br>lvl 31 Rogue 21 -<br>lvl 32 Rogue 22 -<br>lvl 33 Rogue 23 - SC 4 &amp; 5 (Rogue)<br>lvl 34 Rogue 24 -<br>lvl 35 Rogue 25 -<br>lvl 36 Fighter 6 - Epic WF &amp; Spec (Fighter)<br>lvl 37 Rogue 26 -<br>lvl 38 Rogue 27 -<br>lvl 39 Rogue 28 - Epic Prowess &amp; Crippling Strike (Rogue)<br>lvl 40 Rogue 29 -<br><br><br><i>ending vitals: courtesy of Jennalee</i><br><br>Max HP: 344<br>BAB: 26<br>AB (mundane rapier): +42<br>AC (naked, 40 Tumble): 30 = 10(base) + 12(DEX) +8(Tumble)<br><br>Saves:<br>Fort: 20<br>Ref: 32<br>Will: 17<br><br>374 skillpoints<br><br>As I’ll be playing this on my PW, I’ll be using Teifling.

Well, welcome to this guild and happy posting!<br><br>Maybe you should have posted the level 40 breakdown of classes in your title but no matter, our omnipresent moderator, the god of editing, griphook can attend to that if he wishes. Just make sure you leave him a suitable offering <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    <br><br>Anyhow, I ran your build through the Character Build Calculator that Kamiryn made and I'll give you the ending vitals:<br><br>Max HP: 344<br>BAB: 26<br>AB (mundane rapier): +42<br>AC (naked, 40 Tumble): 30 = 10(base) + 12(DEX) +8(Tumble)<br><br>Saves:<br>Fort: 20<br>Ref: 32<br>Will: 17<br><br>374 skillpoints<br><br>I know it's listed that these builds should be tested etc and final stats etc posted but I think a first time offender can be indulged. However, if repeat offences are made, your builds may not be listed in the build index <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>On a side-note, most people do not choose to use Harper Scout for with Rogue/Fighter because Shadowdancer gives you HiPS and has a similar 2-feat investment. HiPS is reputedly fantastic for a stealth-type build because you can basically hide straight after disengaging from combat, just 'disappearing' and generating sneaks this way (or just escaping). However, in an environment where True Seeing is common, it's less of an asset, as it may be in your case.<br><br>On another note, Both Cin Din and The Dwarflord have both made builds with this class combination and a similar concept but using more fighter.<br><br>Cin Din's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "211231", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Ultimate Rogue - Rogue 25/Fighter 10/ HS 5</a><br>Grizzled Dwarflord's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "194892", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Harper Negotiator - Rogue 25/ Fighter 10/ HS 5</a><br><br>Presumably, they took more fighter levels to get the two-weapon-fighting feats as well as everything else that is nice for a dexxer because those will greatly increase your damage output because you can potentially get more sneak-attacks off per round.<br><br>If you plan on posting builds here, it may be wise to check with pulse cap's search engine <a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/search/builds.htm" target="_blank">http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/search/builds.htm</a> to see if it's been done before - if you duplicate past builds, people won't be terribly happy <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br>Anyhow, enjoy your time here and have fun and don't take the criticism too hard <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    - don't let any of Kaliban's backhanded comments get to you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    We're just here to help (and hopefully, we're entertaining.)<br><br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif"><br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

Personally, I think this is a good build. He gets SC V early for a non assassin. You have to move SC V one level later, to rogue 24. I know it is just a typo.<br><br>Welcome to the guild. Good to see a new poster who has read and learned how to post from the others around here. Well, next time, provide us with more stats, as you even say yourself.

i thikn that you did well in achieving your goal of getting SCV in quickly.  especially when you don't get much higher than 30 on your PW.<br><br>just as a side note, tiefling is a half-demon class.  supposedly they are evil, which makes this class fun due to alignment confusion. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   its like a blackguard aasimar. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   nothing wrong with this, i just have a weird sense of humour.<br><br>not bad for your fist build.  as jenn mentioned, please post some of the significant stats, even if only at level 30, just to give us more to comment on.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>Do not meddle in the affairs of Dragons, for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.

Thx for the replies, I’ve downloaded the cbc so I can get the stats while at works as that’s were I work out most of my builds. As for trying to find out if any one else has done the build I’ll have to do it the long way as Pluse Cap’s search engine does not work for me for some reason (work internet). <br><br>As I will be going Teifling, anybody got an idea to what extra feat I can take pre epic?  I was looking at Expertise but not sure if it’s worth it with out improved expertise? <br><br>bgw

Luck of the Heroes?

If the search engine doesn't work for you, you can always use your browser's find function on that though it's painful in comparison <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"><br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.
