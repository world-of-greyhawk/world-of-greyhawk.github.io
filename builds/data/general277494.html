Alright the concept was/is the hypothetical love child of Drizzt Do'Urden and Catti-brie. Whom is raised in mithral hall but trained to fight by wulfgar (rage) and Catti-brie (AA skills).

Just at a quick glance, Overwhelming and Thundering do not stack.  One gets overrided by the other.  That said, I would probably go Barb17/Bard4/AA19.  One higher AB and damage, Tumble and UMD, and you still keep Terrifying.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I think the reason you don't find Barbarian / Sorcerer / Arcane Archer is because it's normally better to take Elf and go Barbarian / Wizard / Arcane Archer, you'll start with more DEX and less CHA, which is better, you could also drop WIS for something else, depends on how much you value that 1 will save.<br><br>Since Thundering Rage is of no use, as grizz said, you could change it for Great DEX I, also change some Barbarian levels for Arcane Archer (AA 22 / Barb 17 / Sorc 1), and gain a bonus feat at AA 22 for Great DEX II... or well, some other feat if you don't want DEX but AB is important and your DEX is truly low, because Epic Barbarian was only for Thundering Rage isn't it?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 06/30/07 01:02</span></i></p>

The Critical feats are pretty much your choice, I can't say if Devastating Critical will be better or not, it definitely reduces your ranged Ab since it makes you go 25 STR (and well, the mighty needs to be high for that STR not to go to waste)  but if your enemies have low fortitude saves then the crit feats are worth it...<br><br>It's preferable to take it only in ranged IMO, your melee  is weak in comparison with that much AA levels. You don't have the feats to take all the stuff on a melee weapon again, since your STR is high perhaps your melee won't be that bad.<br><br>More sorcerer isn't very good here, you can make sort of Fighter 4 / Sorcerer 21 / Arcane Archer 15 or something like it which grants buffs and all, sometimes Mestil's is pretty useful to have a good counter to those melees, and of course Epic arcane caster for Epic Warding, but that build is too far from your current one.<br><br>I still say you should go Wizard and Elf, that CHA is a waste...<br><br>Heh, it's nice to be addressed as a wise one <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/01/07 01:18</span></i></p>

I've found Thundering Rage's deafness effect can be rather deciding in battles with arcane casters at times.  20% arcane spell failure is nothing to sneeze at.

Weird, I thought Overwealming critical didn't stack with massive damage bonuses.  If it does, that's awesome.
