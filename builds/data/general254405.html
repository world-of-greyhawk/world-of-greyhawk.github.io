im thinking of building a pal/sor/fighter and it seems there is not one posted.<br><br>just trying to get some ideas for the build.<br><br>would it be worth it to go at least 15 paly lvs for holy sword, or would the lvs be served better in sorc lvs?<br><br>there are many paly/sorc/Rdd builds.  just focusing on the +8 str that gives a +4tohit +4dam.  with 5 fighter lvs i can get WS and EWS for +6dam,  then pump the freed up 5 lvs into sorc for more spell power.<br><br>im thinking either pal 15/sorc 15/fighter5 (holy sword build)<br><br>or ~sorc28/fighter5/paly7   this build would basically max out spell power while getting 4 attcks per rd.  still needs to be tweaked and will prod need to cap sorc lvs at 25 for playability and skill dumps.<br><br>hopefully i can get around to building it, otherwise someone else can take the credit <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>the wifey and i just had twins, they are 6weeks old now... so very little time for NWNs atm!<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 05/01/06 22:18:25 (GMT) by loudent2<br>The only time I exclusively used the radial menu is when my daughter was born.

If i'm not mistaken I think you can get WS and EWS with just 4 fighter levels, if you take them on a fighter bonus feat level. Need to take the 4th on an epic level however. Maybe go 15 paladin (holy sword and +5 gmw, in case holy sword runs out), 16 sorceror levels should get you 8th level spells, and 4 fighter levels.

I'd definitely go for more sorc than that, to qualify for the Autostill feats...unless you want to make a dexer, which I wouldn't recommend.

Congrats on the twins!<br><br>As for the build, my thought is there are really only 2 approaches:<br><br>1) Heavy SOR and concentrate on casting. This would be only enough FTR and Pally levels to get what you want for feats and for the Pally bonuses you desire. Basically, at least 26 SOR levels. High CHA. I'm thinking along the lines of SOR 32/FTR 6/PAL 2 though. You'll only have 3 attacks, and low BAB though.<br><br>*edit* SOR 32/PAL 4/FTR 4 would be an option to avoid XP penalties and also grab Divine Might and Divine Shield.<br><br>2) Heavy Pally with some FTR and only enough SOR for buffs and some no-save spells. Probably something on the order of 16 SOR, possibly 18. Only enough CHA for your spell levels, putting the rest in STR. Use the Still Spell feat for casting in armor, but mainly you'll be buffing beforehand. Maybe something like PAL 18/SOR 18/FTR 4, or even PAL 26/SOR 10/FTR 4. This type of build will be somewhat ability starved though.<br><br>You may also want to watch the XP penalty issues that will arise from using 3 base classes.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 10/05/06 18:57</span></i></p>
