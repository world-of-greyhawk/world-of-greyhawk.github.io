Ideally this build would use kama's, I posted the version I use for a PW I play on where there is a big drop off from Kama's to Short swords in quality to the best of my knowledge, but it would definately benefit from Kama's.<br>Also, I have to edit my original, it was TyrPaladin's Discipline Knight, not monk...<br>Thanks Finn, I kinda get lost in the feat/leveling correlation, losing 40 hp and Epic Will for an extra 2 dex, 1 ac and ab, would definately work...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By jobluntz on 12/19/06 21:05</span></i></p>

He can use kamas all he wants, but the kamas on DLROH has no bonuses over plain enchantment, whic is a notch down from the shortswords. In general of course, kamas is best for such a build.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

In that case Monks in there should seek Cleric, Wizard, Sorcerer, Paladin or Bard to buff those kamas with some power. In this build Monk practically only gives Cleave and IKD (probably some early playability too), Monk is probably not the best to take with Weapon Master in that server. You gain nothing with your 14 WIS, Monk WIS AC is denied if you wear armor or shield, which will be ultimately better as you find magical shields.<br><br>Also, how do you make damage? you have no buffs or anything to increase damage, with a shortsword as you use this build should deal 1d6+6...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 01/04/07 16:43</span></i></p>
