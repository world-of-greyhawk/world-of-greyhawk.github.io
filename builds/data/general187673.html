Author  <br>Lightstalker <br><br>Maxing your BA and AB? <br><br>Joined: 05 Aug 2002 Profile: Monday, 28 March 2005 05:03AM <br><br>I was looking at a build recently and thought it was cool so I decided to try to duplicate it. The build showed the character having 30 BA and +44 AB. I duplicated the build (with slightly different leveling) and got 29 BA and +43 AB. Can what levels you take at what time really have an effect on your base stats? If so, any idea how you should level to keep your BA and AB maxed? What's the science behind it?<br><br>Thanks in advance!! <br><br>@@@   @@@   @@@   @@@   @@@   @@@   @@@   @@@   @@@   @@@<br>             <br>Banshe <br><br>Joined: 17 Dec 2002 Profile: Monday, 28 March 2005 07:25AM <br>I think this needs to be posted in the General Discussion forums.<br><br>As for your question, did you change the number of levels of each class in the build? Or just the order that he recieved the class levels?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 03/28/05 17:46</span></i></p>

With no information on the classes the only thing that is sure is that you messed with the leveling and lost one BA pre-epic.<br><br>Since 30 is the max BAB you can get you MUST take all the 20 first levels as a high-BAB class. <br><br>Barbarian, Fighter, Ranger, Paladin<br>Black Guard, Champion of Torm, Dwarven Defender, Weapon Master.<br><br>If you took just one level of anything else than the classes above you would not be able to get 30.
