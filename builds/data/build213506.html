not bad.  just a quick point which may be of interest.  if you stick with fists or a kama you will get more attacks per round than with a Greatsword.  not a big deal really, but something fun to keep in mind when you need the larger number of attacks per round (large surrounding hordes seem to fit that bill).<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Perception is strong and sight weak.

thanks. it's true. you give up the time-and-a-half strength bonus if you go unarmed, but you do dish out the same basic weapon damage unarmed.  You can't buff unarmed attacks with flame weapon, though.  Kama is buffable, but both lack the style of the greatsword.  Unarmed does have the salutary effect of not being able to be disarmed, which frees up an epic feat (discipline).  although it is useful not to be knocked down, particularly as a caster.

Sorry for drudging up an old build post but I noticed an error with this build.  You lose 1 AB by following this pre-epic progression.<br><br>Compare: <br>Monk 4 (+3), RDD 10 (+7), Sorc 6 (+3) =&gt; +13AB (as posted)<br>Monk 8 (+6), RDD 8 (+6), Sorc 4 (+2) =&gt; +14AB (preferred)<br><br>Yes, it messes with the skill-dumping for Monk's Tumble, but I think it's more than worth the change.  You will lose a few skill points since you're taking 9th level of RDD later but it's not a huge loss.  My suggestion also opens up Improved Knockdown, better speed boosts, +1 AC, and better early saving throws (as well as higher in the long-run) more quickly which is also important.

Stoneskin could be cast on others while Greater Stoneskin and Premonition can't. Maybe he was going for being more party friendly or something. Or maybe some for an additional layer of damage reduction (Premo + G.Stoneskin + Stoneskin)

I've seen a dual kukri dev-critting version of this before, too.  Very, very nasty.  I dig the greatsword, though.  They look pretty damn cool, in my opinion.  Nice work, Ithacan <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">
