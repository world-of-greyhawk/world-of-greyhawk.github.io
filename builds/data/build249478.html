There are a number of builds in the Guild that use both CLC and WIZ, but nothing quite like this as far as I cuold see. Many of the others use either 1 level of WIZ to access AA or go heavy WIZ.<br><br>CLC 26/WIZ 13/Bard 1<br><br>Gnome, any non-lawful<br><br>Playable from level 1 to 40, PvM.<br><br>STR: 12<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 16<br>INT: 15 (17)<br>WIS: 16 (32)<br>CHA: 8<br><br>1 )CLC1: Spell Focus:Evocation/ Domains: War and Plant<br>2 )CLC2<br>3 )CLC3: Weapon Focus:Sickle*<br>4 )CLC4: WIS (17)<br>5 )CLC5<br>6 )CLC6: Extend Spell<br>7 )CLC7<br>8 )CLC8: WIS (18)<br>9 )CLC9: Greater Spell Focus:Evocation<br>10)CLC10<br>11)CLC11<br>12)CLC12: Still Spell/ WIS (19)<br>13)CLC13<br>14)CLC14<br>15)CLC15: Maximize Spell<br>16)CLC16: WIS (20)<br>17)CLC17<br>18)CLC18: Toughness<br>19)CLC19<br>20)CLC20: WIS (21)<br>   <br>21)WIZ1: Epic Weapon Focus:Sickle*<br>22)WIZ2<br>23)WIZ3<br>24)WIZ4: Epic Spell Focus:Evocation/ WIS (22)<br>25)WIZ5: GRT INT I (16)<br>26)CLC21<br>27)CLC22: GRT WIS I (23)<br>28)CLC23: Armor Skin/ WIS (24)<br>29)WIZ6<br>30)WIZ7: GRT WIS II (25)<br>31)WIZ8<br>32)WIZ9: WIS (26)<br>33)WIZ10: GRT WIS III (27)/ GRT INT II (17)<br>34)WIZ11<br>35)WIZ12<br>36)WIZ13: GRT WIS IV (28)/ WIS (29)<br>37)CLC24<br>38)CLC25<br>39)CLC26: GRT WIS V (30)/ GRT WIS VI (31)<br>40)Bard1: WIS (32)<br><br>*Choose what you like, but you can cast Keen Edge on the sickle.<br><br>BAB: +25<br>AB with mundane weapon: +30<br><br>AC in mundane plate and large shield: 30<br><br>HPs: 426<br><br>Saves (vs spells):<br>Fort: 25 (34) <br>Refl: 15 (24)<br>Will: 33 (42)<br><br>Skills (189 points):<br>Concentration: 43 (46)<br>Spellcraft: 42 (45)<br>Tumble: 40<br>Perform: 4 (3)<br>UMD: 41 (40)<br>19 points left.**<br><br>**I'm uncertain if one really needs as much UMD in the build as I have here, so an option with these extra points would be to drop UMD to 21 (or 17) and grab 39 (or 43) ranks in Discipline.<br><br>The idea here is to grab some of the nice spells a WIZ has available without resorting to scrolls. Such things as the defensive shield spells and especially the Breaches. Nothing worse for a Cleric than not being able to strip buffs off his opponent, and this set-up will allow that. His WIZ spells can be Dispelled quite easily, so the intent is to use them for a few buffs that won't be vital if lost to Dispelling, but mainly they're used for Breaches and other 'pain in the butt to your opponent' spells.<br><br>The Cleric domains are a matter of choice, but the ones I've chosen provide some extra spells not available to either the CLC or WIZ (and the WIZ slots will bestow some of the spells you'd gain from other domains anyway).<br><br>This guy should be able to toss in a number of offensive spells to either clear the enemy out completely or disable him/them enough to be able to finish things off with a little buffed melee. (A nice benefit of being a Gnome with this build is you can cast the new overpowered Evard's and be immune to your own spell. So, you can really make life miserable for some of the bad guys).<br><br>Spell Penetration woes are easily covered (for the default highest SRs) with a single Greater Spell Breach to lower resistance. Then blast away.<br><br>I won't bother going through all the numbers for buffs/damages, but keep in mind you have a ton of ways to augment AC (Cat's Grace, Barkskin, Shadow Shield, Magic Vestment, UEF, Haste, etc.) as well as all the tasty Cleric buffs for AB and damage (max possible AB with this build is +56). Reciprocal damage shields from the WIZ spellbook is just gravy.<br><br>One last note (and it pains me to say this): a better choice for the cheesy final level skill dump would probably be Monk, as you still get Tumble and Discipline (if you want it) and you can grab a big AC boost from the Monk synergy with WIS. It will also provide you with Cleave and Evasion for free. But, I don't use Monk.

Like the idea of cleric casting with wiz spells as support, one problem thou. Arcane based spells suffer major casting failure in heavy plate &amp; shield, maybe throw away some meta-magic feats and put in autostills? Nothing more annoying in combat than trying to rip off that armor while trying to cast that breach...

What, no monk, Cinn? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>Nice concept! Even gots a bit of a bard song in there, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  With all those spells of yours to choose from, for sure you'd be a pain out there -- suggestion, as to spell penetration woes, why not drop Armor Skin for epic spell greater ruin, which does good damage even if the target makes their save; interesting thing about that one is that it ignores spell resistance (ah, just some more ruin for Theurge to cause - oh, and 26 rounds of creeping doom? (plant, yes?) Nice, Cinn. Me likes <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Wow, very nice!   <br><br>Undispellable Cleric buffs; enough Cleric caster levels to beat toolset SR, and some nice Wizard utility spells.  I also like how you made use of the Wizard bonus feats to raise your Intelligence.<br><br>I've often found that being able to throw on a Spell Mantle before battle can give you enough time to "manage" the battle without incurring too much damage from their spells.<br><br>The only thing I might do differently (and this is purely a matter of flavor), is to drop Armor Skin and Epic Weapon Focus for AutoStill I &amp; II.  This will let you cast your 6th level Wiz spells in their normal slots and (iirc) cast them "stilled" in you 7th level slot.  Again, thats just my opinion, and it may not be worth the loss of 2 AB and 2 AC.<br><br>OR<br><br>You could just go to the Darkside and take a level of Monk.

Thanks for the feedback folks.<br><br>Dmuzzy: I like the idea of the Autostill feats. It's an interesting option.<br><br>As for the Monk levels, if you drop your plate and shield and go with Monk, you end up with almost the same AC (+11 from WIS, but plate and shield gives you +10), but you no longer are able to cast magic vestment for a shield AC boost. I guess it depends on your environment. If you have access to high magic items, then you can pump up both DEX and WIS for more AC than you'd get from Cleric spells, so Monk may be better in that case. I don't think I'll turn to the dark side yet though... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Good build, good build, but wait, 32 WIS and 12 STR? this is definitely more caster than meleer, it probably wouldn't hurt change Weapon Focuses to ranged and get some Zen Archery in there to catch a nice AB, I haven't worked out the damage besides Divine Favor, but I'm sure it isn't so damn bad, the AB boost is still considerable even with +1 weapons and no GMW compared to your melee with GMW.<br><br>If you don't like bows what about Blind-Fight at least?<br><br>Nice build, you show how Clerics are also good casters, not only buffers.<br><br>Wait, you never use monks!? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">  wow... I mean... I can't believe it... it's almost as dangerous as saying dwarves suck... curious though, how did you got to the light side?
