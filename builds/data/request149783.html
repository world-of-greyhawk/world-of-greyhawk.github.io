Thanks to Kamiryn for clarifying these 2 points.<br><br>Firstly Damage Immunity Increased is 100 percent immunity to that particular element. So every shadow from summoned shadowfiend up is 100 percent immune to Cold/Fire and electrical damage. <br><br>Secondly the level of DR that the epic shadowlord has is 30/+2. <br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

You can delete the 'This abilitiy can only be activated once per day.' from the Defensive Roll description because there is no such limitation. The feat description is wrong. I've suspected that for quite some time but verified it just yet.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.Detail&amp;id=856" target="_blank">Character Build Calculator</a>(works with Excel, Open Office) 2.83: updated to NWN 1.69.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kamiryn on 12/07/05 21:27</span></i></p>
