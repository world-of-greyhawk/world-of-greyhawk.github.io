I just thought I'd throw this idea out there and see what you guys think of it (ya I'm bored at work).<br><br>Pick 2 Epic builds from the current posted Epic Builds and pair them together.  They should work as a team and compliment each other.  And not just the "Good show old chap! I do say mummy will be pleased..." I mean two builds that excel when paired together.<br><br>Your task is to explain why these two builds pair up smoothly and what their fighting style (group tactic) would be.<br><br><br>I'd rather not see the same build listed twice.  Like Joe Mage and his clone.<br><br>Pairings would have to make some type of RP sense too.  Can't pair a Paladin with a practicing Blackguard (or Palemaster).  If you do, go heavy on the explanation.<br><br>This should be a fun read.<br><br>Don't list the build stats, just put a link the each build.

I'm not going to check any builds right now, but I guess the best combo that excells through teamwork in stead of simply two powerful individuals would be one character that focuses on buffing and healing and one that focuses on dealing damage... The buff guy keeps up the defensive side of things and the damage guy the offensive.

I can feel your boredom from here man.<br><br>Anyway, I'm too egocentric not to choose both builds from my own... which might end without any consecuence anyway, i.e. my stunner with my sneaker or my tank with my caster, but just picking only my builds is too wrong and I know I would ultimately do so.... unless you really dont mind.

Ok, that said, here's an idea (if you're up to it, as this is afterall your thread): why don't we, totally totally at random, pull two builds, any two at all, and see how on earth they might possibly work together. Someone might suggest an environment, say, the woods, or a crypt - then, someone else pulls two builds, any two at all, doesn't matter - point is to see how on earth to make 'em work together. <br><br>Anyway, just a thought .... that is, if you're still bored tomorrow <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  (oh, I don't know, might be kinda fun, but gotta be totally at random (I'm game if you guys are, and thinking: hmmm, let's say, Thax' Claw and my Dragon Blade are ...

Using your own builds makes sense since you should be very familiar with it's strengths and weaknesses.  So if you want to use 2 of your builds, that's fine, but explain how they compliment each other and what their weaknesses are.<br><br>I also like the idea of two random builds plopped into a random setting.  Start up that thread too.

That will be very easy then.<br><br>I'd combine <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "262121", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Divine Exclamation (Druid 37 / Assassin 2 / Monk 1)</a> and <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "248564", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Dwarven Abomination (Cleric 17 / Fighter 1 / Dwarven Defender 22)</a><br><br>Now then, I'm not too sure they really excel that much in team work style, but they sure are a force to be reckoned with. Dwarven Abomination is great in any party, he is overall great in melee, a tanker with good damage and AB, as well as a buffer and a healer, similarly, Divine Exclamation is a buffer, caster, healer and summoner, it will be definitely hard to kill a team of two healers.<br><br>They can buff each other very nice, specially adding Cleric's AC buffs to a Druid.<br><br>Basic tactic is working out what they do best: Divine Exclamation sets up a powerful paralisis with Storm of Venegance (I think DC was 45) while Dwarven Abomination takes them out in melee, aided by a powerful Panther companion which makes an overwhelming sneak attack, a sure and easy kill against just about anyone who misses the save, possible immunity to stun by the enemy will not be a serious issue for a tanker such as this, and Divine Exclamation has other good damage spells if needed. Conveniently, Dwarven Abomination can cast Resurrection if Divine Exclamation was to die in combat, while he being a tanker will resist much more damage, and both can set up an annoying defense line of summons <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>BTW I haven't seen your combination Bromium, set a good example as the author of the topic.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/08/07 03:39</span></i></p>

I'm looking for a good second build to pair with my Holy Iciles.  One that won't get hurt by them, and who can take out an opposing Rak and/or dev crit fellow.

Sheesh.  There's so many combinations.  Obviously, we all are most comfortable with our own builds, and only the old-timers will have any intimate knowledge of other people's builds.  That said, I think the following would be a pretty lethal combo:<br><br>Vulcano's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "236487", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Gnome Mechanic</a> <br><br>and Kail's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "253741", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Pale Sneaker of Doom</a><br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 02/09/07 16:02</span></i></p>

Yes, bare in mind that that combo would achieve most lethality in an environment where EBT is currently at the default, or at least only slightly modified.  For those who have nerfed it back to the nerfshelf, then I would lean somewhere else.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

At high end epic levels, the tactic should be to buff before hand fully, shift into dragon form, enter combat and knock down with both of them until P&amp;S starts generating Sneaks.  At lower levels, there is more of a problem as they are both late bloomers.  Still, the buffs should help make up for a lot of P&amp;S's weaknesses.
