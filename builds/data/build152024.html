After those 18 rounds, the dwarf still has 71 AC and 850 HP, which'll make him only a little less hard to kill. And those 18 rounds is more then enough to kill your enemies with IGMS or Bigby's hands.

Tengudor_t,<br><br>Not sure if this suggestion would be useful now...<br><br>Anyway, I noticed that your build has hefty amount of CON, and by the time you are mid 30s or so, you have more than enough CON.

I usually don't consider poison as a threat (this character has big fortitude save anyway), but if you are fighting with people who poison a lot, go ahead - most of Dwarf's great constitution feats can be exchanged for things like perfect health - it won't affect the integrity of this build, although it'll leave him with less HPs.

Does epic damage reduction stack with epic warding? Or premonition? I think it does (not 100% sure about that however), so therefore it would not be the best choice for this build, bacause it'd be useless 90% of the time anyway.
