My first reaction would be to think that the stats are wrong. Wisdom needs more boost, dex and con less, as an example. Alternatively you could be a more strength related buffing cleric if you took Strength Domain instead of Healing.<br><br>Elf means (more) XP penalties and it's difficult to see what the benefits are in this build.<br><br>No Epic Spells makes me wonder why 20 levels in Cleric. I think you either have to go more Cleric or less. Three possibilities that get rid of XP penalties (as a human) are: C18/Fi16/Mo6<br>C28/Fi6/Mo6<br>C23/Fi8/Mo9

I never did get a chance to finish it online, although I did play with it a bit in epic character maker. I am a total noob to this game as I just bought it back in Sept. <br><br>The reason I chose elf was because of this PW I have been playing on. It was suppose to be built to the rp but I tried to make it effective. I was debating on taking it to epic spell level as I could have gotten the dragon spell with 25 spellcraft. Unfortunately the server had a mishap and everything got wiped so I had only gotten her to level 27. I did have the option of going 24 cleric with it but I hadn't made that final decision.<br><br>Thanks for the ideas bout the wis. I am trying one now unarmed, but with more monk. I don't think I care for it but was trying to get enough monk to take Spell Resistance I-III.  Maybe I need to think of another elven cleric mix with some fighting power for this rp. <br><br>Thanks again,<br>Werithe<br>_________________<br>Be the change you want to see in the world ---Ghandi

If you want to play Elf then you really need a build that makes use of Dex. I'd suggest thinking about an Arcane Archer or Rogue based build.

6 Monk is very efficient, as you get Wis AC bonus, evasion and IKD, plus some speed, 1 bonus to AC and a bonus to saves. This level of Monk tends to suggest a melee build, and Clerics can also make good melee fighters due to their excellent buffs.<br><br>I'd suggest taking the Strength and Trickery (for Improved Invisibility) domains. While Fighter seems an obvious choice to add to this mix, an alternative is CoT, which could mesh with the Cha needed for Turning.<br><br>There is also Ranger, getting the "free" TWF feats and dual-wielding kamas.<br><br>Race-wise, as an Elf you can take a decent starting Dex cheaply, and the Monk levels mean wearing no armor, so this is not a disaster. You could even go Cleric/Monk/Rogue to go for a Cleric with Epic Dodge.

Actually WMs get a bonus feat every three levels after 10, and also get +1 to attack rolls made with Weapon(s) of Choice on those levels. I know the manual states it's every 5 levels, but it's wrong, it's every three.

Herbie is correct.  I have played many wep masters.  Bonus feat is every 3rd level past 10, as well as +1 ab every 3rd level after 10.  I generally try to get at least 19 wep master lvls at the minimum, as I also hate "wasting" all of those feats for just 7 or 10 lvls.  So ideally you want either 19, 22, 25, or 28 wep master lvls.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

Thanks for all the insight guys. Someone had suggested going more elf for the dex, but failed to mention the exp penalties and where they lie. <br><br>The PW offers reincarnations, and she is getting her first one so she will be getting an additonal boost +2 to dex. Perhaps in her next reincarnation I can go back to half-elf. There is a particular reinc that focuses on monk 3rd-6th reinc. I am presently playing her now with a focus on cleric, although I eventually do want to focus more on a monk. (perhaps with spell resist and dam resist). In-game she is to level 18 and here I have sent her to level 40 via Char. Builder. This is how I think I want to continue with her build I will post this separately if you think I should. Suggestions are welcome, you guys are great.<br><br>Elf LG-female (of course)<br>23cleric/11fighter/6monk <br>Str 13 ---&gt; 13<br>Dex 16+2--&gt; 22<br>Con 12----&gt; 13 (she needed some more hps)<br>Int 13----&gt; 13<br>Wis 15----&gt; 21 <br><br>Levels 1-10<br>6-cleric/2-monk/2-fighter<br>dodge,weapon finesse,mobility, power attack, cleave, great cleave, weapon focus-unarmed,<br><br>Level 11-20 (6-cleric/3-monk/1-fighter)<br>combat casting, improved crit-unarmed, extend spell<br><br>Level 21-30(4-cleric/1-monk/5-fighter)<br>Epic-WF, Epic Prowness, Weapon Spec, Epic-WSp, Max Spell, Spell Penetration, Imp.

Hi Werithe,<br><br>I'm a big fan of elves as well. My first elven cleric was a pure cleric, 40 levels, maxed wisdom and feats focused on metamagic feats. My second was a cleric rogue shadowdancer. He was lots of fun. <br><br>I'm just polishing a new build atm that sounds similar to yours, and that is a Cleric Rogue Monk. It's a hard build to pull off because of no prc, xp penalties and low feat numbers. However there is such a synergy between these 3 classes. From memory my final build was something like M12/R13/C15. You can avoid xp penalties until the last few levels if you keep the classes even. Stats raises mostly on dex, with just enough wis to cast 8th level spells by the end (18 wis). Dual weild kamas, epic dodge, sneak attacks, Trickery domain (for impr invis) and Animal (for dex buff).<br><br>Cleric spells on this build are mainly used for buffs, particularly Divine Power and Divine Favor. You get lots of attacks, sneak and divine damage, improved evation, improved knockdown and you can run pretty fast.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Zyn248 on 11/23/04 05:02</span></i></p>

A dex based elven finesse monk with a high listen and enough levels of pally to cast holysword can be a way effective mage-killer in my experience. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  Not to mention being able to sniff out the shadowdancers with active search.
