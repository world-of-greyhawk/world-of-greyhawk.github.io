If you don't mind being a corny Monk 1 build, you could take that instead of Rogue.  It'll get you Evasion (VERY useful with a reflex save as high as yours) and +2 AC from your wisdom, which I think is worth losing UMD and 1d6 sneak damage.

If your saves, before and after buffing, are as high as you say they are, then drop Epic Fortitude and take Epic Skill Focus: Discipline. Not sure if you can take it at 24th level or not - you may need to do some feat shuffling in epic to get it in. <br><br>Also drop Great Fortitude at 1st for Toughness.

All input is welcome.<br>Second, I freely admit I have no idea what my saves really are. Standing fully buffed and geared up in the PW I play on, the numbers are as I stated. It sounds to me like I need to rethink my plan for this guy. The goal was to avoid the stunning fist (DC 61) of an evil Queen who resides in this world as well. Looks like in my zeal I have gone overboard. I have access to craftable rings so I can make them with +5 to each save and I wear 2 of them giving +10 to fort ref and will. So with that +10, and the +12 I get from adding my CHA modifier due to divine grace, the COT bonus is actually nil?  Plus I am getting +8 to fort from my CON modifier. <br>Third, the idea of fewer COT lvls was actually proposed to me by Ithacan, but I was too stubborn to listen. It may warrant some looking into, the only problem is I used the COT bonus feat to raise my wisdom to allow 3rd and 4th lvl spells. <br>OMG, back to the drawing board.<br>_________________<br>Its not whether you win or lose, it's how you take winning and losing that matters.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Markus Tarek on 02/10/06 16:43</span></i></p>

Sorry had missed ESF Discipline at 21 - but is your Base Discipline correct at only 43 then? I can only assume you have not maxed it throughout the life of the build.

The saves may actually be correct. The Pally's CHA bonus to saves doesn't count towards the cap, so it may be that enhanced CHA from items also doesn't get counted in the cap. I'm not certain of this, but it may explain what the game's showing.<br>_________________<br>Captain's Log, Stardate 6051: had trouble sleeping last night... my hiatal hernia is acting up.

The divine grace additional boni to saves due to a pumped up CHA do not count towards the cap, AFAIK. Due to the +12 from CoT (counts towards the cap) this leaves a possible +14 increment on saves (+6 from capped CHA, +8 from capped base saves)<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Monk would idd be a better choice, and i would probaly change the skill focus feats to other feats, and the epic skill focus feats to Great str or Great cha feats. Altho, it seems like a really nice build, gotta test it some day <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

Why not drop 2 CoT levels and take another 2 rogue levels... more skill points, Evasion, Uncanny Dodge (well, not really important here) and another 1d6 sneak attack. Perhaps I'm missing an important detail but I don't think the last two CoT levels add anything besides +1 to saving throws (most likely lost because of the +20 cap).<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.Detail&amp;id=856" target="_blank">Character Build Calculator</a>(works with Excel, Open Office) 2.83: updated to NWN 1.69.

Or knocked down? In the harsh world that spawned this critter if you dont have discipline you might as well stay on the bench. I could see where it might not be needed in PVM but this guy is strictly PVP, and quite honestly nothing hurts more than losing your weapon to an evil villain you then have to listen to gloat about it on shout! And I already explained why monk is out of the question, no UMD.<br><br>At any rate, posting here has opened my eyes a little so you will soon see my NEW AND IMPROVED Strongarm of the Law.
