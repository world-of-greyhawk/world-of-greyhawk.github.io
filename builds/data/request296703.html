He has to be human and lawful evil...  I tried searching the builds till my eyes went blurry last night, but didn't really find what I need. I don't know If maybe a ranger/ftr/assasin would do, I really have never tried a build like this, and with AA being out I am struggling. I would like him to get dev crit with a bow, which on my server needs EWF and EWS. Thanks in advance for your help.

I'd say Fighter/Bard/RDD. With the need for Dev with a bow, and without AA you'll need all the Dex you can get. So a starting STR of 16 + 8 from RDD and you're almost where you need to be already. One advance in STR, then go DEX for the rest.<br><br>Starting<br><br>STR 16<br>DEX 14<br>CON 10<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 14<br><br>Make it fighter14/Bard16/RDD10 and you'll be good to go, with Bard buffs and song, fighter to get all the wanted feats and RDD to get the much needed STR boost.<br><br>*EDIT* Darn, forgot the Lawful part for a second there.

Take a Cleric with Zen Archery, you'll get a neat ranger and caster at the same time. You can even add some CHA and take Divine Might as extra damage, it should work pretty good. If you like the idea I can help you with the leveling guide.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/28/06 23:16:09 (GMT) -- Big Meph<br>Using the 2 ESF's in a dex based sneak build, <i>to me</i>, just looks like you're teasing your diabetic opponent with extra sugar on your whipcream covered chocolate mudcake.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Gah..  either I am horrible at this or I dont think I want to be putting an archer together without having the ability to use AA. I am leaning towards the first choice really...  after all I have to look here to get ideas. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Umm...  maybe you could help me out a bit with the best progression/feat order?<br><br>*heads back to the tester to try again*

Man, every single time I make a good suggestion the class is restricted somehow.<br><br>Well, there's not much to say on how to build an archer, boost DEX for AB, RDD will make up for the STR on mighty bows.<br><br>Feats, take Point Blank Shot, even if you're not aiming for Arcane Archer it is needed to take Rapid Shot. Take Blind-fight, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Extend Spell and whatever else you like, Lingering Song may be nice. In epics take Epic Weapon Specialization and lots of Great DEX, there's nothing really important to take there IMO, so I'd just boost DEX a lot. You should get a lot of extra feats from Fighter, so what I wrote there won't fill it all up, but all you need for an archer is Epic Weapon Specialization, Rapid Shot and lots of DEX, all the rest can be for Bard stuff.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 05/20/08 00:03</span></i></p>

If you can force them to let you play Half Elf or Elf, then I'd go Fighter/Bard/AA. That way AA compensates the points you invest in STR.

Oh, right, I forgot to address that: Devastating Critical is a bad idea dude, the non-dev-crit version is stronger.
