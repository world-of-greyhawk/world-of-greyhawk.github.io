You have to have a wisdom score of 30+, wild shape 6 times a day or greater wildshape IV. However I have managed to gain the dragon shape feat with wild shape 5 times a day.<br><br>I forgot to mention that I also took the Armor Skin feat as well.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Jehoshua on 07/04/05 08:34</span></i></p>

The prereq for dragon shape is listed wrong just about everywhere, including the Grimoire. I asked in the general forum not too long ago, and got a <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=436973&amp;forum=42" target="_blank">good answer</a>.

Have you built this and tested it? I do not remember the shifter class feats here and now, but I assume you get feats every 3 levs, that means you take Shifter as your last lvl and get Dragonform then? A bit late..... But you will have loads of other nice shapes, of course. If you are making this build solely to play as a dragon, the only thing all your shifter levs do is raise your breath weapon damage, which is nice, but that alone is not worth spending all those levs, take more Druid ones instead.

When fighting in natural habitats Im at my strongest due to the benefits from the druid levels. Fighters and the like stand little chance unless they have devastating critical. My saves are good being Fort: 37, Ref: 33, Wisdom: 39. I come across a problem when I battle mages due to the low SR (27). But with the combination of stunning fist, Improved Knockdown, Evasion, Breath Weapon and the Sheer amount of attacks give me a good chance. With the help of items I only get stronger as well (Which I didnt try). I saw no reason to take more levels in druid because I had all the buff spells I wanted. And yes shifters gain bonus feats every 3 levels. Thanks for the advice but I ask How come you would suggest to take more druid levels?

Well, it all depends upon how you want the build. But more Druid levs are of little use if you dont attack with spells. If you attack with spells, more druid are good. And your buffs are harder to dispel. Remember that if you are debuffed as a dragon, you might be in trouble. Epic spells can be nice to. The nice thing with a dragon is its ac, and in a fight where 20's are needed, you can win with using your breath weapon, or from the sheer nr of attacks. This is not mean criticism, just my opinion, the build looks good.
