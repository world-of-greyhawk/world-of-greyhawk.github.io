Hi,<br><br>I am looking for help on recreating a fictional character (Father Abel Nightroad a.k.a. The Crusnik) from the anime series Trinity Blood for Neverwinter Nights. The character will be used on a player vs monster server and  will rarely, if ever, be used in PVP combat. (more information on the server can be found here: <a href="http://forum.playzen.net/index.php?showtopic=107" target="_blank">http://forum.playzen.net/index.php?showtopic=107</a> . This isn't meant as advertising. If this is viewed upon as such, please tell me and I'll remove this link immediately.)<br><br>The idea behind the character is a travelling priest. A travelling priest who is rather clumsy and weak, wearing black and white robes. However, his "gun" skills are reasonably good (read: crossbow). The priest works for a secret department of the church and carries a dark secret within him. In essence, when he's "human" he's pretty useless, yet funny and intelligent. When he transforms into his other form he becomes a swift vampire slayer. In essence, he is a vampire who drinks other vampires' blood. In this state his eyes glow red, his hair stands up straight, his angelic/demonic wings appear and he wields a huge blood coloured scythe.<br>This is a brief summary of what the character is like in the anime series.<br><br>Now I don't want to create the strongest character around. What I would like is model a character after something I would like to play (in this case a vampire with two faces who hunts other vampires), but make it as strong as it can be within that set of guidelines.<br><br>So... what am I asking?<br><br>I'd like help on picking classes for:<br><br>- A human.<br>- Scythe wielder.<br>- Dexterity focussed (preferably avoiding damage or attacks rather than taking the blows, even if this means not dealing a lot of damage myself).<br>- Able to use a crossbow (normal bow doesn't fit my idea of playing this character and I can request custom recipes on the server for a repeating crossbow at a later stage).<br>- Wearing cloth/leather or no armour, but certainly not full suits of mail or such.<br><br>Again, the character doesn't have to be able to perform well in PvP or in general. I just don't have the brain to follow all the class guidelines and stick to every rule. What has often happened to me is that I level a character after work during my spare time and after a while I find out that I've done something wrong and cannot take a certain feat I wanted. This blows the entire gaming experience for me and makes me toss the game back on the shelf. What I would like is first for people to suggest class combinations and give a short overview of the character development (levelwise with feats and stats) and in the end I'd like someone to write out a path from level 1-40. It's simply the way I prefer to play. I want to see what to take at which level.<br><br>I don't know if the idea of what I want is completely clear. If it's not, please feel free to ask questions.<br>Hope to see some interesting suggestions from you guys! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>I like to play NWN for the "story" aspect. At later stages I see this character forming the AX department of the Vatican from the anime series on this server, with headquarters, pope, cardinals, everyhting. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Thank you in advance!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ThinG-83 on 07/03/05 14:10</span></i></p>

Is this character a good meleeist?  Is he "magical"?  The xbow is easy to fit in, as is the scythe, but at the same time you want to inflict some damage, right?   What will it be facing most of the time, undead? <br><br>I am not sure if you can get the "change" of face that it seems you want.  There is only one class that does this, and from what you suggest, shifter isnt an appropriate class for the build.<br><br>I apologize for my ignorance (i have not seen the movie you refer to) but at first intuition, i am thinking you would want to make a dex based fightr/wiz/palemaster.  <br><br>Why? The fighter levls give you the melee ability and feat selection to specialize in 2 wpns (scythe and xbow).  I suggest wiz vs bard, as wizards always seem to fit better with a vampire theme imho than a bard would (you sacrifice ab but fightr makes up for it).  BTW, i only suggest taking the 3 lvls of wizard (unless you want more magic-ability), but it doesnt really fit with a vampire (or does it).   I'd take palemaster to lv 16 max.  It gives you a nice defense (imm to crits, undeadish <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  ) and an epic spell or 2.  Id take these lvls pre-epic though.  I'd also suggest fighter for the wpn spec and epic wpn spec skills for the extra  damage.  Being dex based, you will need them.<br><br>A nice alternative would be a paladin/wiz/pm for the imm to fear that a vamp slayer would have, but you are limited this way in feats and such.<br><br>There are other ways to go, but id thought id throw this out there as a primer (i am on vacation so i dont have the time to build it for you.  I'm sure one of my fellow builders can do that for you.)<br><br>Peace

You can't finesse a scythe, so you would still need a decent STR to use one effectively.  I can think of two possibilities, monk/cleric/fighter (you can pump wisdom and STR, use zen archery with the crossbow and your WIS modifier will be added to your AC.  It won't be uber, but it might work okay) or a cleric/druid/shifter (use the risen lord form for your scythe wielding and unshifted you should do well with zen archery and a crossbow).<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

A shifter shadowdancer might fit the bill, its possible to get SC5, epic dodge and most of the scythe feats on a risen lord.  Im currently "refining" my "Hidden Lord" build, but it does seem reasonably effective.

Thank you for your replies!<br><br>As for the "change of face"; this will be mainly roleplaying. NWN currently does not accomodate the type of change I would like, so what others will see is simply a human in robes with a scythe and hopefully later on a a pair of wings.<br><br>As for the class suggestions; I personally wasn't envisioning the character actively using offensive magic. Buffs and "illusions" would be ok (temporary cause fear and what not). In the series, when the character transforms it's your average pants-pooping-moment, so that would fit in nicely.<br><br>The reason why I wanted it to be DEX based is because the character is rather clumsy and isn't really very strong or very broadly built.<br><br>I don't think I'd even mind if the character would be really silly and couldn't accomplish a whole lot. All the more reason to group up and meet new people. Equipment is usually easy to acquire on the server, so the character will have plenty item support to cover up for its flaws. <br><br>The character from the series is actually pretty useless when in human form, so I wouldn't mind sacrificing damage dealing capabilities for dodging Dexness. I can compensate low strength with items if need be. Let's say I'm looking for a character that can avoid damage rather than deal it. I'll depend on party members or on sheer luck to actually kill things. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Having a "religious" class in the mix would be nice for roleplaying purposes. I think that means either a monk, cleric or paladin or even a champion of torm. A cleric would be a little too magicky again, but I may have to twink the character a bit for game purposes. No point in making a character that really isn't playable...<br><br>I've just read up on the risen lord thing... I actually didn't know the shifter got vampire and other shapey things... never really played it that far and it has been a while. It actually sounds great as in essence, Abel Nightroad is a vampire who preys on other vampires. I can't seem to find pictures of any of the shapes though, pity.<br><br>I'm currently interested in hearing more about the shifter build. When would the character get access to those shapes and will they be useful end-game? Not that turning into a dragon wouldn't be nice, but still the roleplaying aspect. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Thanks for your help so far! You're really helping me out because my view on all the possibilies are so limited.

Don't seem to be able to edit my post right now. &gt;_&gt;<br><br>That Risen Lord thingy sounds great after reading up on it! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  Now if only I could have a look at one. u.u<br>I honestly had no idea that the shifter received these specific forms. It *sounds* exactly like the thing I'm looking for at least.<br><br>I picked up this in the forums:<br><br>"I really like an Rogue 25/Druid 5/Shifter 10, with Epic Dodge, minimum wisdom, maximum dexterity, all the weapon focus feats for Schyte and exclusively using the Risen Lord shape."<br><br>Druid and shifter would be the two required classes if I were to go for the shifter route. Rogue would certainly help with my desire to go for a DEX based character if I'm not mistaken and it suits the travelling priest image neatly as well. Anyone see this class combo work reasonably in-game?

Avado; I am going for a character with good ballistic skills and a skinny appearance. This means no barn door wide Half Orcs. That's all.
