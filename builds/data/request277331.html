I was thinking of such a build but i couldn't find anything in the search. Basicly what im thinking is something like wizard 38/fighter1/SD1. Automatic still spell and fighter for the profencies but i have no idea how i should distrubute the classes or what feats to take becasue im no builder.<br><br>Anyone have any thoughts on this?

Palemaster has the stealth skills as class skills and let you qualify for shadowdancer without crossclassing skills.<br>Wizard 37/PM 1/SD 2 will give you HIPS and evasion and save you 18 skillpoints compared to the fighter route. It also let you take your first SD level earlier and a second SD lvl later for  skilldumping.<br>But you won't get the armor proficiency for free like with fighter.<br><br>A problem with a sneaker wizard in full plate is that your effective hide/move silently skills will be rather low because of the armor penalty and the (usually) low dexterity of the wizard.<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan
