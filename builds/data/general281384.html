I asked this question on the nwnwiki but didn't get a response yet.  So I figured I'd pick the brains of the local populous.<br><br>On wiki:<br><br><br>Ok so does EDR III (9/- DR) stack with Epic Gargoyle (25/+7 DR) and (25/- Pierce Resistance) ?<br><br>Would it be soaking up 34 points from a +5 sword and 59 points from an arrow? Bromium 08:38, 14 August 2007 (PDT) <br><br>===<br><br>EDR III stacks with a DD DR, so a lvl 22 DD (15/-) + EDR III (9/-) would give him 24/- DR.<br><br>Now as I see it... it should stack with Epic Gargoyle 25/+7 DR and 25/- Pierce Resistance.<br><br>Am I missing something on that?<br><br>So an Epic Gargoyle Dwarven Defender could potentially soak 25+24 from slashing/blunt &lt; +7 and 25+24+25 vs piercing weapons &lt; +7.<br><br>Now would items buffs that give 5% slashing/pierce/blunt immunity also stack with all that?

Nope, they don't stack, Damage Reduction stacks with Damage <b>Resistance</b> but when dealing several damage reductions of the same type only the highest value applies, if you have 9/- and 25/+7 and you get attacked by lower than +7 your 25 is going to work but the 9/- gets "jumped", if you get attacked, say, by a +10 only 9/- works, for obvious reasons.<br><br>You can only stack EDR with Barbarian or Dwarven Defender's natural DR as far as I know. You count that X/- adds to X/-, which is correct when stacking EDR with Barbarian and Dwarven Defender, but X/- won't add to X/+#, just as X/+A won't stack with X/+B, you could say it's a different type of reduction each time. You can't even stack X/+A with another X/+A, just equip two items that give reduction of the same degree and they won't stack, only the higher applies. EDR, Barbarian DR and Dwarven Defender DR are all Base DRs, they all add themselves to your same "base character stats", or so I think, any other type of DR is not "base" or natural to your character, it's applied with items, shifts or spells = external sources, I think that's why they work different, but that is just my opinion, I know nothing about how this stuff is scripted.<br><br>If DRs stacked, I would've been building Dragon Dwarven Defenders a long time ago, the dragon 40/+6 added to a 15/- would make an immortal dude on low magical servers, but since they don't stack it's a big waste.<br><br>I think your 25/+7 damage reduction does stack with the 25/- pierce resistance, but I think your damage resistance won't stack with another damage resistance of the same type, but it does with a different type (i.e. slashing stacks with piercing, but piercing won't stack with piercing).<br><br>This kind of stuff you should test if you want to know for sure, I could be wrong, the new version could be different, but they didn't stack on older versions and I believe it is the same now.<br><br>EDIT: I just checked what the wiki says, and it's correct as far as I know:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>* Damage reduction stacks with damage resistance. So an Ironskin Ring, which provides 10/+5 damage reduction, will stack with a Greater Brawler's Belt, which provides 20/- bludgeoning resistance, resulting in a total of 30 damage ignored from each bludgeoning attack made with less than a +5 enhancement. <br><br>    * Damage reduction stacks with damage immunity. Immunity is calculated first. <br><br>    * <b>Damage reduction does not stack with itself. The only exceptions to this are the Barbarian-, Dwarven Defender- and Epic- Damage Reduction feats</b> (i.e. the sources of x/- damage reduction); these feats stack with each other.<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>That is actually a good explanation IMO.

Actually an item-based damage reduction DOES stack with the EDR feats.<br><br>The log will report your +7/25 reduction, your EDR III ,and your resistance as seperate amounts of DR.<br>You could do a Barb/DD/Monk with EDR III and it would all stack... <br><br>However when applying spell based damage reduction it will use the highest spell effect DR first ... then add your EDR and resistance...<br><br>P.S. Actually DD Dragons kinda rock depending on the situation. Seen plenty of them.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By SKIPPNUTTZ on 08/22/07 03:11</span></i></p>

Tricky shifters.
