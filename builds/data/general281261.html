A 67 SR Monk has never killed one of my mages, those weaklings die against Mestil's Achid Sheath. Casters can summon, they have familiar, and be ready to die if they have Epic Summons, a 67 SR monk has lousy combat stats.<br><br>Rakshashas can get pretty cool ACs, those can be quite hard to beat for a pure caster. Against Rakshashas the considered "crap build" of Sorcerer 20 / Wizard 20 works better than a Sorcerer 40 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  you get more level 9 spells to kill them.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Mages fear other mages. He (or she) who casts Time Stop first wins. Implosion or Harm can also be a threat. Not much else is.<br><br>TM

Sorry, the closest thing to a mage I will play is a druid, and that is because I need them for shifter levels.eeee

Timestop spam+creeping doom!<br><br>Or not... but most death magic works since mages have low fort saves in general. Unless they have set up some immunity against this.<br>A necromancy cleric could probably be dangerous for those spellslingers.

Druids... I think the best goes for Finger of Death and Storm of Vengeance, those work  pretty good, but you'll definitely die against their Spell Mantles, by the time you breach them you're already dead, Druid is not much of a good choice.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

I think TM has pretty much nailed it. Probably the thing a mage fears the most is another mage with a faster trigger finger.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

You might want to go green dragon dragon shape for that rather than EER kobold.  The greatest banes against mages are: <br><br>1) Speed: If you can move fast enough that the mage can't easily target you you're golden.  In a mod you can use pillars to your advantage.<br><br>2) Immobilization or combat insta-death.  Stunning fists, death attack, and dev crit will prevent the mage from casting spells.  Assassins will probably have to UMD a mord to strip the damage shield, but once the mage is paralyzed he can't win the fight except by your blunder. Knockdown is nice but it only lasts one round and continually hacking at a damage shield isn't fun.<br><br>3) Spells: from mord's to bigbys its pretty much a spell duel.<br><br>Lesser considerations:<br><br>SR: being able to resist a mage spell is nifty  but will only serve by itself to delay the combat, though a high wisdom pure monk with zen archery can force a draw, and after many hours is likely to win.<br><br>Rest exploitation: Find a mage that is resting and charge.  Mages will probably run from you casting greater sanctuary as soon as possible.<br><br>Holy Sword: Though valuable at getting down damage shields you will have at best a 50% chance at each damage shield whenever the dispel triggers.  It will take them more than a round to take down a shield and only half a round for the shield to go back up.  Mages can rebuff.<br><br>Immunity to death magic: Level 40 mages will probably use a lot of insta-kill spells.  Only sorcerors can change to a technique that they aren't prepared for.
