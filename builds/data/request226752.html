My favorite build is the unarmed version of the Temple Guardian: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "226517", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>The kama version is nice for mods or PW's that either don't have good gloves or offer forges to upgrade weapons but not gloves. I like the freedom the unarmed version gives in terms of feats - you can easily swap out 2-3 feats to try different things (like energy resists, etc.) without affecting the build much, while the kama version is very tight (you could pick up 1 by going Human, but not much more without impairing the core of the build). These are both str-based, which is also my preference.<br><br>For dex-based builds, I had a lot of fun with the Felonius Monk. <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225896", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>That's a primarily Rogue build with just a little monk, and used a single kama, but it was a lot of fun. Sneak up, IKD, followed by a full round of 15d6 sneak attacks. Or set a bunch of traps, sneak up and give them 1 whack to get their attention, then lead them to the traps. It was also a lot of fun to roleplay with, especially in Aielund where there are lots of opportunities to shift alignment through dialogue or action.<br><br>TM
