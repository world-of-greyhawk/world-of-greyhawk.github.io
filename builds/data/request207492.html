I have searched and searched, and just can't seem to find a build that utilizes monk/cleric/dwd. I was kind of thinking something along the lines of cleric 15(for maxed buffs), and either dwd14/monk11 or dwd18/monk7. Not sure if this is the optimal way to build this, or if this would even be a good build at all. I was just kind of thinking that you could use the cleric to buff AB (of course), monk for many-attacks and some speed, and obviously dwarven defender would be to stoke up the defense. <br><br>Anyone know of or seen a build like this? If not, I'll take a crack at it and post it in the epic build forum, but didn't want to re-invent the wheel.

Pump Wis for cleric DCs and AC from your monk level, so you can wear robes and dual wield kamas perhaps.  You get Knockdown/Improved Knockdown from monk levels, 9/- damage reduction and a bonus feat from your DwD levels.  Be a sort of battle caster, which is how I play more pure clerics anyway.  Don't get an epic spell...need at least one more cleric level for that, but not sure it's really worth it.  It's an interesting idea.  Might play around with it if I have the chance.  XP penalty for sure though.<br><br>Steve<br><br>Edit: Oh, and to answer your question, I couldn't find any with those three classes either.  None with pulsecaps search engine, nor in the recent builds since the last time that list was updated.  So I don't think it's been done before.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 08/07/05 10:04</span></i></p>

Hmm, now this idea is interesting.  Not sure if you saw my self-reliant monk build and the subsequent rebuild in the epic build forum.  It was pointed out to me that dwarven defender is not really that beneficial, so I built it with CoT in my second version.<br><br>Anyway, I do like your suggestions, and might give another variation a whirl.  Cleric and monk are my two favorite classes, so it's a no-brainer for me to combine the two <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   The hardest part is sacrificing the monk levels..I LOVE monk speed <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
