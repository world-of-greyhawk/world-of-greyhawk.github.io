Here is a significantly altered version of the last paladin based disarmer I made taking the advice of the others who, despite the doffoculty in reading it, were good enough to comment. Sorry if anyone feels like it's all fallen on deaf ears, it hasn't, but sometimes I'm too stubborn to listen.<br><br><b>straight level 40 PvP</b><br><br>Race: Elf<br>Alignment: Lawful neutral (immune to smite)<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str: 8 <br>Dex: 18 (all level up points go here)<br>Con: 10<br>Wis: 16<br>Int: 14<br>Cha: 8 <br><br>Domains: Trickery, healing<br><br>Leveling<br><br>1 monk: dodge<br>2 Cleric<br>3 Cleric: weapon finesse<br>4 Cleric<br>5 Cleric<br>6 Cleric: weapon focus: rapier<br>7 Cleric<br>8 Cleric<br>9 Cleric: expertise<br>10 Cleric<br>11 Cleric<br>12 Cleric: mobility<br>13 Monk<br>14 Monk<br>15 Monk: Spring attack<br>16 Monk<br>17 Cleric<br>18 Cleric: whirlwind attack<br>19 Weaponmaster<br>20 Weaponmaster<br>21 Weaponmaster: Epic discipline<br>22 Weaponmaster:<br>23 Weaponmaster:<br>24 Weaponmaster: Discipline<br>25 Weaponmaster<br>26 Weaponmaster<br>27 Weaponmaster: Blind-fight<br>28 Weaponmaster<br>29 Weaponmaster<br>30 Weaponmaster: Epic weapon focus, Epic fort<br>31 Weaponmaster<br>32 Weaponmaster <br>33 Weaponmaster: Epic prowess, great dex I<br>34 Weaponmaster <br>35 Weaponmaster<br>36 Weaponmaster: Armourskin, great dex II<br>37 Cleric<br>38 Cleric<br>39 Cleric: extend spell<br>40 Monk<br><br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 8<br>Dex 3o<br>Con 10<br>Wis 16<br>Int 14<br>Cha 8<br><br><br>Skills<br><br>Disc<br>Heal<br>tumble (40)<br>Hide (29)<br>Move silently (29)<br><br>HP<br><br>Can't remember.

Plenty of great utility spells like find traps, other spells that are very good to have such as greater sanctuary and true seeing as well as the ability to heal itself, and all the ab buffs last much longer due to more casts, levels and slots.<br><br>I apoligize once again for been oversensitive with the last wm build, and will be open minded to opinions, ideas and suggestions.

Why are you going DEX-based when you are never going to get Uncanny Dodge nor all the nice things about going DEX like Epic Dodge and SC? Go STR and use Human for the race to avoid EXP-penalties.<br><br>Also, I'd drop WM to 16 and take monk to 9 to pick up IKD earlier and end up with Improved Evasion at the end.<br><br>And, BTW, you need 18 WIS to cast the 8th level Cleric spells that 15 Cleric levels give you so you'll need to raise WIS.<br><br>You forgot Imp. Crit. You're a WM without Imp Crit! Swap out Epic Fort.<br><br>I also wouldn't bother with ESF: Discipline and especially not SF: Discipline if that's what it is. Did you mean Improved Disarm? There's more useful Epic Feats out there.<br><br>With 15 Cleric levels, you may not want to rely on Divine Power either, being highly dispellable so you might want to take WM earlier to get 16 BAB by level 20 and 4 attacks per round. Extend Spell would be more useful if taken earlier, too, but it's probably not possible to take it 'till 18th level, earliest if you want WM pre-epic.<br><br>It's also an idea to include the class level number you're taking at that character level beside the class so it's easier for people to read and follow.

I thought monk levels would get the full 5 attacks, or is it only for full base classes? It's meant for pvp where the disc skill and it's opposed feat checks are very common. What would you take instead of discipline?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By D O'Brien123 on 11/07/05 14:05</span></i></p>

You could do something like this (not fully optimised, you could probably squeeze a bit more joice out of this), which doesn't get to dual-wield due to feat concerns. If you don't want to use robes and the monk unarmed progression that comes from fighting unarmored, you'll probably want to shell out for Martial Weapon Proficiency at level 1 and pick something like Scimitar/Rapier and just use armor, and move WM up from pe-epic and probably start with 16 WIS and give yourself 2 WIS boosts only to get your spells when you can use them. BTW, WM doesn't give you Martial and Simple so this character is kinda screwed with regards to weapon choices -_-.<br><br><i>Broken Winged Holy Chicken</i><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: any lawful<br><br>Stats:<br>STR: 15(26)<br>DEX: 13 &lt;- for Dodge/Mobility/Spring Attack<br>CON: 14<br>INT: 13 &lt;- for Expertise<br>WIS: 14(18)<br>CHA: 8<br><br>01: Monk(1): Dodge, Mobility, M: (Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist)<br>02: Cleric(1): Domain Trickery, Domain War<br>03: Cleric(2): Weapon Focus: Kama<br>04: Cleric(3): STR+1, (STR=16)<br>05: Cleric(4)<br>06: Cleric(5): Expertise<br>07: Monk(2): M: (Deflect Arrows)<br>08: Cleric(6): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>09: Cleric(7): Spring Attack<br>10: Monk(3)<br>11: Cleric(8)<br>12: Monk(4): STR+1, Whirlwind Attack, (STR=18)<br>13: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Kama<br>14: Weapon Master(2)<br>15: Weapon Master(3): Improved Critical: Kama<br>16: Weapon Master(4): WIS+1, (WIS=15)<br>17: Weapon Master(5)<br>18: Weapon Master(6): Blind Fight<br>19: Weapon Master(7)<br>20: Weapon Master(8): WIS+1, (WIS=16)<br><br>21: Cleric(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Kama<br>22: Monk(5)<br>23: Monk(6): M: (Knockdown, Improved Knockdown)<br>24: Weapon Master(9): WIS+1, Extend Spell, (WIS=15)<br>25: Weapon Master(10)<br>26: Cleric(10)<br>27: Cleric(11): Great Strength I, (STR=19)<br>28: Monk(7): WIS+1, (WIS=18)<br>29: Cleric(12)<br>30: Cleric(13): Great Strength II, (STR=20)<br>31: Cleric(14)<br>32: Monk(8): STR+1, (STR=21)<br>33: Weapon Master(11): Great Strength III, (STR=22)<br>34: Weapon Master(12)<br>35: Weapon Master(13): Epic Prowess<br>36: Cleric(15): STR+1, Great Strength IV, (STR=24)<br>37: Weapon Master(14)<br>38: Weapon Master(15)<br>39: Weapon Master(16): Great Strength V, Armor Skin, (STR=25)<br>40: Monk(9): STR+1, M: (Improved Evasion), (STR=26)<br><br>Max HP: 432<br>BAB: 27<br>AB (mundane kama): +42<br>AC (naked): 26 (32 if you want to use armor + shield and another weapon with a better crit range)<br><br>Saves:<br>Fort: 24<br>Ref: 23<br>Will: 26<br><br>+8 vs. Spells<br><br>Skills (196 points):<br>Discipline: 43(51)<br>Tumble: 40(41)<br>Spellcraft: 39(40)<br>Concentration: 43(45) &lt;- if you feel like ditching this, take the last monk level at 37 and move WM down.<br>Intimidate: 4(3)<br><br>+ 23 left over which I'd put into Heal<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.
