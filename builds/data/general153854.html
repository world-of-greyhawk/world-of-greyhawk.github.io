I was messing around today with a strength based archer but for some reason when I fitted my char with a bow his AB didn't rise as it should have. My highest AB when unarmed was 44 and when I equiped my bow it only rose to 46. I built this char pretty quickly because I was just messing around and just wanted to see some results but I thought when it came to ranged weapons it automatically takes the highest mod. from either your str. or your dex.

Strength doesn't add anything but dmg with a mighty bow.
