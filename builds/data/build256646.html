Here's a pair of blokes that are well-balanced Dexer Meleers.  Just good old Rogue/Fighter builds.  They're essentially the same build, except the Dwarf was able to make more of the stats than the Half-orc could, even though the Half-orc version is still my personal favorite (come on, who else can start with an 18 Strength and still get Epic Dodge by Level 27?).  There's a few subtle differences between the two, such as the Dwarf gets 90 more skill points, 40 more hitpoints, +1Fort, IKD, and +1d6sneak.  The Half-orc gets +1 more damage on Main and off-hand, gets ED 1 level earlier, has gets Called Shot &amp; Improved Crit, but loses IKD and a lot of skill points.   But while the Half-orc wins the style contest, the Dwarf takes all.  He just gets too much more in extras to not go unnoticed.  Both are highly playable pre-epic.<br><br><br><br><b>Battle Rogue of the Harper Lords</b><br><br>Rogue19/Fighter16/Harper5<br>Race: Dwarf<br>Alignment: Any non-evil<br>Playable: 1-40, PvM<br><br><b>Attributes</b><br>Str16<br>Int14<br>Wis8<br>Dex15 (34)<br>Con16<br>Chr6<br><br><b>Level Guide</b><br><br>1 Rogue1, Knockdown<br>2 Fighter1, Weapon Focus: Maces*<br>3 Fighter2, Ambidexterity, Two-Weapon Fighting<br>4 Rogue2, Dex16<br>5 Fighter3<br>6 Fighter4, Weapon Specialization: Maces*, Weapon Finesse<br>7 Rogue3<br>8 Rogue4, Dex17<br>9 Rogue5, Blindfighting<br>10 Fighter5<br>11 Fighter6, Improved Knockdown<br>12 Rogue6, Iron Will, Dex18<br>13 Fighter7<br>14 Fighter8, Improved TWF<br>15 Rogue7, Toughness<br>16 Rogue8, Dex19<br>17 Rogue9<br>18 Rogue10, Alertness, Improved Evasion<br>19 Rogue11<br>20 Rogue12, Dex20<br>21 Rogue13, Defensive Roll, Great Dex I<br>22 Harper1, Great Dex II<br>23 Fighter9<br>24 Fighter10, Epic WF: Maces*, Great Dex III, Dex24<br>25 Fighter11<br>26 Rogue14<br>27 Rogue15, Great Dex IV<br>28 Rogue16, Epic Dodge, Dex26<br>29 Fighter12, Epic WS*: Maces<br>30 Rogue17, Great Dex V<br>31 Rogue18<br>32 Harper2, Dex28<br>33 Fighter13, Great Dex VI<br>34 Fighter14, Epic Prowess<br>35 Rogue19, Crippling Strike**<br>36 Fighter15, Great Dex VII, Dex31<br>37 Harper3<br>38 Harper4<br>39 Fighter16, Armor Skin, Great Dex VIII<br>40 Harper5, Great Dex IX, Dex34<br><br>*or Shortswords, Handaxes, Lighthammers, etc...<br>**not vital, and can be substituted with ESF: Discipline, Slippery Mind, etc...<br><br><b>Combat Vitals</b><br>Melee AB: 43/38/33/28<br>Dualwielding: 41/36/31/26/41/36<br>Mainhand Damage: 1d6+9 (19-20/x2)+10d6sneak<br>Offhand Damage: 1d6+7 (19-20/x2)+10d6<br>Ranged AB: 40/35/30/25<br>AC: 32 (35 w/Tower Shield)<br>HP: 472<br><br><b>Saves</b><br>Fort: 23 (25)<br>Will: 17 (19)<br>Reflex: 32 (34)<br><br><b>Skills</b> 314<br>Hide: 43 (55)<br>Move Silently: 43 (55)<br>Discipline: 43 (46)<br>Tumble: 40<br>UMD: 37 (35)<br>Search: 11 (15)<br>Persuade: 8 (6)<br>Lore: 6 (10)<br>Open Lock: 18 (30)<br>Disable Trap: 31 (35)<br>Set Trap: 28 (42) <br>Heal: 6 (5)<br>_______________<br><br><b>Half-orc Version</b><br><br>He's not an iconic Rogue.

I like these, Grizz. Nice ABs, lots of very good abilities. Versatile, rock-solid FTR/Rogues. +5 style points for 1/2 Orc. Noteworthy additions to the Harpers in the Guild.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
