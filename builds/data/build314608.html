Using the Fist of the North Star as inspiration, this is a DEX/CHA based monk that is focused on unarmed combat with a bit of divine help.  Lite, since heads don't explode when he punches them...<br><br>While his AB is low-ish (38), he has a Taunt skill of 47 to help improve it.  His naked AC is a respectable 34, but his HP is low and not having Epic Dodge is a pain (Monks really should get this...), so he has Divine Shield and Called Shot to help his survival rate.  Damage is fairly limited at 1d20+2 but can be boosted by Divine Might, a little bit of Sneak Attack (along with IKD) and can wield any martial weapon if the need calls for it.  He also has the ability to set Deadly Traps, use pretty much any magic item, and moves at warpspeed.  All-in-all, has enough skills and feats to round out his arsenal and makes for a fun RP character.<br><br>I found one other build using CHA and unarmed, which is Avado's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "200549", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Internal Martial Artist</a>.  His is fully CHA-based and uses Fighter instead of Rogue, but we had the same conclusion about using Divine Might/Shield as internal chi.  Credit to him for coming up with this 4+ years ago(!) but I did put this guy together before finding his build.<br><br>There are only a few other builds but none really focus on the Monk class.<br><br><b>Fist of the North Star Lite (Rogue 5 / Paladin 5 / Monk 30)</b><br>Rogue(5), Paladin(5), Monk(30), Human<br>Lawful Good only<br>PVM 1-40, Untested PVP<br><br>STR: 14<br>DEX: 16 (26)<br>CON: 10<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 10<br>CHA: 16 (20)<br><br>Human: (Quick to Master)<br>01: Rogue(1): Toughness, Power Attack<br>02: Monk(1): {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br>03: Paladin(1): Weapon Finesse<br>04: Paladin(2): Dex+1, {Smite Evil}, (DEX=17)<br>05: Monk(2): {Deflect Arrows}<br>06: Monk(3): Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br>07: Rogue(2)<br>08: Monk(4): Dex+1, (DEX=18)<br>09: Paladin(3): Divine Shield<br>10: Monk(5)<br>11: Monk(6): {Knockdown, Improved Knockdown}<br>12: Rogue(3): Dex+1, Improved Critical: Unarmed, {Uncanny Dodge I}, (DEX=19)<br>13: Monk(7)<br>14: Monk(8)<br>15: Monk(9): Called Shot, {Improved Evasion}<br>16: Monk(10): Dex+1, (DEX=20)<br>17: Monk(11)<br>18: Paladin(4): Divine Might<br>19: Monk(12)<br>20: Rogue(4): Cha+1, (CHA=17)<br>21: Monk(13): Epic Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br>22: Monk(14)<br>23: Monk(15)<br>24: Monk(16): Cha+1, Epic Prowess, (CHA=18)<br>25: Monk(17)<br>26: Monk(18)<br>27: Monk(19): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=21)<br>28: Monk(20): Dex+1, (DEX=22)<br>29: Monk(21)<br>30: Monk(22): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=23)<br>31: Monk(23)<br>32: Monk(24): Dex+1, (DEX=24)<br>33: Monk(25): Great Dexterity III, Armor Skin, (DEX=25)<br>34: Monk(26)<br>35: Monk(27)<br>36: Monk(28): Cha+1, Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=26), (CHA=19)<br>37: Rogue(5)<br>38: Monk(29)<br>39: Paladin(5): Extra Turning<br>40: Monk(30): Cha+1, Improved Spell Resistance I, (CHA=20)<br><br>Hitpoints: 360<br>Skillpoints: 237<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 28/24/36<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2<br>BAB: 26<br>AB (max, naked): 38 (melee), 35 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 34/34<br>Spell Casting: <br>Alignment Changes: 0<br><br>Disable Trap 10(12), Discipline 43(45), Listen 27(26), Open Lock 12(20), Search 8(8), Set Trap 15(25), Taunt 42(47), Tumble 40(48), UMD 40(45)<br><br><br>01: Disable Trap(4), Listen(4), Open Lock(4), Set Trap(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(12), <br>02: Discipline(5), Tumble(1), Save(11), <br>03: Discipline(1), Taunt(6), Save(7), <br>04: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(8), <br>05: Discipline(1), Save(12), <br>06: Discipline(1), Save(16), <br>07: Disable Trap(1), Listen(1), Open Lock(1), Set Trap(1), Tumble(5), UMD(6), Save(10), <br>08: Discipline(2), Save(13), <br>09: Discipline(1), Taunt(5), Save(10), <br>10: Discipline(1), Save(14), <br>11: Discipline(1), Save(18), <br>12: Listen(5), Search(5), Set Trap(5), Tumble(5), UMD(5), Save(2), <br>13: Discipline(2), Save(5), <br>14: Discipline(1), Save(9), <br>15: Discipline(1), Save(13), <br>16: Discipline(1), Save(17), <br>17: Discipline(1), Tumble(5), Save(16), <br>18: Discipline(1), Taunt(8), Save(10), <br>19: Discipline(1), Save(14), <br>20: Listen(5), Open Lock(2), Search(3), Set Trap(5), UMD(8), <br>21: Discipline(2), Save(3), <br>22: Discipline(1), Tumble(5), Save(2), <br>23: Discipline(1), Save(6), <br>24: Discipline(1), Save(10), <br>25: Discipline(1), Save(14), <br>26: Discipline(1), Save(18), <br>27: Discipline(1), Tumble(5), Save(17), <br>28: Discipline(1), Save(21), <br>29: Discipline(1), Save(25), <br>30: Discipline(1), Save(29), <br>31: Discipline(1), Save(33), <br>32: Discipline(1), Tumble(5), Save(32), <br>33: Discipline(1), Save(36), <br>34: Discipline(1), Save(40), <br>35: Discipline(1), Save(44), <br>36: Discipline(1), Save(48), <br>37: Disable Trap(5), Listen(10), Open Lock(5), Tumble(5), UMD(17), Save(15), <br>38: Save(20), <br>39: Taunt(22), Save(1), <br>40: Discipline(4), Listen(2), <br><br>Some additional notes:<br><br>1.  Paladin 4 and Rogue 4 were taken as late as possible to max out those class-specific skills since Paladin 5 and Rogue come at the end of the build.<br>2.  Divine Shield is taken first since AC is this toon's primary concern in the beginning.<br>3.  In the first 10 levels or so, he can level up like a typical fighter type character with sword and board until the monk abilities catch up.<br>4.  I chose the 26/20 DEX/CHA split but 28/18 is viable as well if CHA gear is plentiful on your server.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 02/01/10 17:09</span></i></p>

DAM, where were you 4 years ago??   LOL  Mine was a concept build to look at the way a "real" martial artist seems to get better with age!  The rogue adds damage, which this sort of build really needs, so that is good.  I wish i could say more, but my daughter is getting fussy..
