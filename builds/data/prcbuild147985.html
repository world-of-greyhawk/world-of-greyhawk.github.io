The vigilant dreadnaught is an unstoppable force of destruction. He wades into battle aware of everything around him. Few can sneak up on him even when he is at rest, as he always has an open eye out for those who would do him harm.<br><br>Race	Human			<br>Alignment	Neutral			<br>				<br>Starting Stats				<br>Str	16			<br>Dex	12			<br>Con	16			<br>Int	14			<br>Wis	8			<br>Cha	8			<br><br>Character LevelProgression:<br>1- Fighter - Concentration 4, Discipline 4, Listen 2, Lore 4, Persuade 2 - Power Attack, Track, Weapon Proficiency-Exotic<br>2- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1 - Weapon Focus-Bastard Sword<br>3- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Listen 1, Persuade 1 - Endurance<br>4- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1 - Weapon Specialization-Bastard Sword - Str<br>5- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Listen 1, Persuade 1<br>6- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1 - Cleave, Great Cleave<br>7- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Listen 1, Persuade 1<br>8- Vigilant - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Intimidate - Str<br>9- Vigilant - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Intimidate 1, Spot 4 - Improved Critical-Bastard Sword, FE-Dragons	<br>10- Vigilant - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Intimidate 1, Spot 4<br>11- Vigilant - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Intimidate 1, Spot 4<br>12- Vigilant - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Intimidate 1, Spot 3 - Knockdown - Str<br>13- Vigilant - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Heal 1, Spot 1, Tumble 2<br>14- Vigilant - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Heal 1, Spot 1, Tumble 1<br>15- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Tumble 1 - Blind Fight, Improved Knockdown<br>16- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Tumble 1 - Str<br>17- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Tumble 1 - Disarm<br>18- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Tumble 1 - Improved Disarm	<br>19- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Heal 3, Tumble 1 - Called Shot	<br>20- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Tumble 1 - Str<br>21- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Tumble 1 - Epic Weapon Focus-Bastard Sword, Great Strength I<br>22- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Tumble 1<br>23- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Tumble 1 - Epic Weapon Specialization-Bastard Sword<br>24- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Tumble 1 - Great Strength II - Str<br>25- Vigilant - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Spot 11, Tumble 1<br>26- Legendary Dreadnaught<br>27- Legendary Dreadnaught - Tumble 1 - Overwhelming Critical-Bastard Sword<br>28- Legendary Dreadnaught - Str<br>29- Legendary Dreadnaught<br>30- Legendary Dreadnaught - Devastating Critical-Bastard Sword, Improved Initiative<br>31- Legendary Dreadnaught<br>32- Legendary Dreadnaught - Str<br>33- Legendary Dreadnaught - Epic Will<br>34- Legendary Dreadnaught<br>35- Vigilant - Concentration 10, Discipline 10, Spot 10, Tumble 4<br>36- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1 - Armor Skin, Epic Damage Reduction III - Str<br>37- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Tumble 1<br>38- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1 - Epic Prowess<br>39- Fighter - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Heal 18 - Improved Power Attack<br>40- Vigilant - Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Heal 4, Spot 5 - Str<br><br><br>Level Distribution				<br>Fighter	21			<br>Vigilant	10			<br>Legendary Dreadnaught	9			<br><br>Final Skills:				<br>Concentration 43			<br>Discipline 43			<br>Heal 27			<br>Intimidate 15			<br>Listen 5<br>Lore 4<br>Persuade 5<br>Spot 43<br>Tumble 20<br><br>Final Stats:	<br>Str	28<br>Dex	12<br>Con	16<br>Int	14<br>Wis	8<br>Cha	8<br><br>Due to his classes this character has a max HP total of 618. Due to his dreadnaught levels he gets damage reduction 1 &amp; 2 and takes 3 as a regular feat giving him 9/- total. Vigilant class gives great fortitude, iron will and lightning relfexes, dreadnaught gives epic fortitude, and with the epic will feat this character has respectable saves of 32 fort/19 ref/21 will. With a normal bastard sword this characters attacks are +43/+38/+33/+28 with a damage range of 16-25 per hit. For those really tough AC critters twice per day this character can activate his unstoppable ability giving him a +20 to hit on his next attack. If he is fighitng something that gives him trouble with knockdowns or disarms, he can activate his unmovable ability giving him +20 discipline, but this reduces his speed. Fortunately he can sprint once a day to make up for that lost speed. Finally he has a natural regen of 1 and natural armor of +2. In normal full plate with a tower shield his AC is a very respectable 30. Some basic magic can easily push that into the low 50s.<br>All in all this character plays like a very solid tank, able to take damage as well as dish it out.<br><br><br>EDIT BY LOCKINDAL: Added the class structure in the topic.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Lockindal on 08/16/04 07:59</span></i></p>

I would also like to give Anuis a lot of thanks. He and I talked a lot about different aspect in a  build I was looking for, and this is the result.

I am curious... why take Epic Damage Reduction if the Legendary Dreadnaught already has it?<br><br>Remember the Damage Sinker? Stratovarius said that the Legendary Dreadnaught already took them, you are only able to get 9/- damage reduction, not 18/- damage reduction as you should get.<br><br>You can replace them with something different. Perhaps some feats that would boost something that is low about the build. I have no idea what the fortitude, reflex or will is. But if you have one of them that is low, you can increase it by taking specific feat.<br><br>And by the way, you forgot to include the level layout in the title. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Anuis

I haven't played on MP lately.<br><br>However, I am working on a mod that would suit this purpose, it is mainly testing for all epic builds, including the PrC. It is also arena for two epics to fight against each others, basically fight to death. And it has PC leveler and single merchant that sells every items that exist in the game. Although I will be editing that soon so that the merchant would only sell non-enchanted stuff. But I might consider having magical weapon as well, except that it will be removed once you step out the magical items allowed arena and replaced with same type item but with no enchantments.<br><br>But I have no idea if the module would be hosted or not... the last host has not responded to my last mail in couple weeks ago.<br><br>Sorry for off topic discussion....<br><br>Anuis

I let the legendary dreadnaught class get me epic damage reduction 1 &amp; 2 at class levels 4 and 9. To let it get me EDR 3 I would of had to raise the class to 14. I didn't think it was worth the levels, when I could get it as a fighter bonus feat.
