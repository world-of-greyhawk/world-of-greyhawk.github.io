The Avatar of the Silent Lord, a master of necromantic arts, is the most formidable offensive necromancer that can be seen. Its mastery lies in his unmatched DCs on necromantic spells, far above those of an elemental savant or a true necromancer. The wise player will be able to end any fight with a single spell, except against golems.<br><br>Race : Human<br>Align: any non-good.<br><br>Stats:<br>str: 10<br>dex: 14<br>Con: 14<br>int: 18 (28), all points here<br>wis: 8<br>cha: 8<br><br>Leveling order :<br>5 Wizard (specialist necromancer)<br>10 Red wizard<br>5 Shadow Adept<br>20 Red wizard<br><br>Feats :<br>1 : Spell focus necromancy, Greater spell focus necromancy<br>3 : Tatoo focus necromancy<br>5 : Extend spell<br>6 : Shadow Weave ; give up the schools divination (opposed to necromancy) and enchantement<br>9 : Empower spell (for Circle of Death and Undeath to Death)<br>10 : Maximize spell (for Circle of Death and Undeath to Death)<br>12 : Spell penetration<br>15 : Greater Spell penetration<br>18 : Silent spell<br>21 : Epic spell focus necromancy<br>23 : Focused penetration necromancy<br>24 : Epic spell penetration<br>26 and all the remaining feats : Greater intelligence (total of 10)<br><br>Skills to max :<br>Concentration, spellcraft, lore, tumble 20, and all you may want (stratospherical intelligence allows some choice).<br><br>At level 40:<br>Max HP: 280<br>Wail of the banshee DC 63 with +12 intelligence items.<br>Spell penetration of 63 on all necromancy spells.<br><br>Pros :<br>-DCs unmatched.

Well, I was more thinking about combat vs Golems, who are immune to all of those that you just posted. (Undead are too, but you've got Undeath to Death to make em go away). <br><br>As for the Archmage, most servers that I know of don't ban it. Also, there is nothing wrong with having high DCs in a spellschool, even if you are an Archmage. Making it harder to resist your spells is always a good thing, not a bad one <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.nwnprc.com" target="_blank">Player Resource Consortium</a>

I can attest to the sheer power of a Wiz/RW/Archmage combo, especially with mastery of elements and shaping, and having several nice necromancy spells prepared as 2x per day SLAs, the combo just tears apart anything that's not immune to necromancy spells.

I am interested in seeing an Archmage version of this build, if anyone has one.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

Using a custom race though, its possible to get equally good DCs on the necromancy spells.  I have a Yuan Ti Sorceror 25 Cleric 15 Hierophant 5 (all hierophant bonus feats into increased spell power) that gets similar DCs on the necromancy spells.

Why kill undead, when you can just control them with control undead! The Dc on that should be pretty damn close to ubeatable.<br><br>As for golems, the build still gets a check of +20 on spellcraft, which means it can get plenty of nice epic spells. A couple of godsmites should take care of them. Bigby and IGMS are always options.<br><br>I wouldn't worry about AC. Just throw up Mestil's and Epic warding.

Just noticed that your build can't get 10 great intelligence feats. RW gets feats at 15, 20, 25 and 30. That's 11 epic feats total.
