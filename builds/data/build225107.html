Most people say to stop at 17 or 19 at the most</b><br>A:  The special ability save DCs and damage dice of most of the shapes is directly tied to how many shifter levels you have.  As a result I took as many shifter levels as made sense to me.<br><br><b>Q:  Why zen archery?</b><br>A:  In case you run into a situation where none of your forms are effective, you can still plink with a magic bow or sling or something.<br><br>[b}Q:  Aren't alot of those monster abilities sort of unimpressive for epic level characters?(/b)<br>A:  Yeah, it's unfortunately the case that the save DCs on many of those are a little too low even with 28 shifter levels.  However, the vampire gaze, mindflayer blast, and wyrmling and dragon breath abilities are quite nice, and even the petrification gazes can be rather useful on low-fort targets (such as arcane casters).<br><br><b>Q:  How come you only list the monster abilities that level-dependent DCs or damage dice?  Those forms all have a lot of other things involved!</b><br>A:  Because this is a build description not a shifter forms guide <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    Look in the grimoire or other shifter guide threads for information there.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Xylophone on 12/27/05 00:54</span></i></p>

Yeah it's pretty neat to play in lower magic environments where the monster abilities are useful, though probably somewhat weaker than the "standard" shifter builds due to low BAB <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br>Picking the right shape for the job adds a fun strategic aspect to encounters.  It's a shame your highest DC abilities - psi blast and dom gaze - are both mind effecting.  Though for taking down general fodder targets, your wyrmling breath actually works pretty nicely on groups.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

A good consideration for those looking to play shifters more for their abilities rather than melee is to take Int to 13 or 14 and select both Expertise and Improved Expertise.<br><br>That extra 10 ac sure helps - use it a lot myself.<br>Just a shame the DCs are abysmal for this class <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  <br>But hey definitely fun on an autofail 1 server, especially when petrify the death immune nightmare boss hehe.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By lala_truthsayer on 01/05/06 00:24</span></i></p>
