Ok... I got work tomorrow morning and its allready past 2 am... so no story right now.<br><br>My idea was to make the ultimate infiltrator that's just supposed to get in anywhere.<br>And thats about it...<br><br>Race: Halfling (Elf is possible but you lose the +4 hide size bonus and +1 small stature AC)<br><br>Alignement: Any (suggest non-lawful as sneaking into places is your main objective)<br><br>Playable from lv 1-40, PvM only.<br><br>Ability scores:<br>Str: 12<br>Dex: 20 (34)<br>Con: 10<br>Wis: 10<br>Int: 14<br>Cha: 8<br><br>HPs: 312 maxed.<br>AC: Naked/mundane robes: 30<br><br>BAB: 24<br>AB with mundane dagger: +37/+32/+27<br><br>Saves:<br><br>Fort: 17<br>Ref: 41<br>Will: 17<br><br>Level progression, max all skills listed below each level:<br>Hide, Move Silently, Tumble, Open lock, Disable trap, Heal, Listen, Spot and Search.<br><br>1: Rogue1: Alertness*<br>2: Rogue2: Evasion**<br>3: Rogue3: Dodge<br>4: Rogue4: Dex +1<br>5: Rogue5:<br>6: Rogue6: Mobility<br>7: Rogue7:<br>8: SD1: Hide in Plain Sight**, Dex +1<br>9: SD2: Weapon finesse, Darkvision**<br>10: SD3:<br>11: SD4: Shadow Evade**<br>12: SD5: Weapon Focus: Dagger*, Defensive Roll** Dex +1<br>13: SD6:<br>14: SD7: Slippery Mind**<br>15: SD8: Stealthy*<br>16: SD9: Dex +1<br>17: SD10: Improved Evasion**<br>18: Rogue8: Toughness*<br>19: Rogue9:<br>20: Rogue10: Skill Mastery, Dex +1<br><br>Epic Levels:<br><br>21: Rogue11: ESF: Disable Trap<br>22: Rogue12:<br>23: Rogue13: Epic Dodge<br>24: Rogue14: Epic Reflexes, Dex+1<br>25: Rogue15:<br>26: SD11:<br>27: SD12: ESF: Search<br>28: SD13: ESF: Listen, Dex+1<br>29: SD14:<br>30: SD15: Great Dex I<br>31: SD16: ESF: Spot<br>32: Rogue16: ESF: Open Lock, Dex +1<br>33: Rogue17: Great Dex II<br>34: Rogue18:<br>35: Rogue19: ESF: Hide<br>36: Rogue20: Great Dex III Dex +1<br>37: Rogue21:<br>38: Rogue22:<br>39: Rogue23: Great Dex IV<br>40: Rogue24: ESF: Move Silently, Dex+1<br><br>*Feats not vital but helps alot<br>**Rogue and SD innate bonus feats.<br><br>Skillpoints, maxed each level:<br>Hide: 43 (67)<br>Move Silently: 43 (69)<br>Tumble: 43 (55)<br>Open Lock: 43 (65)<br>Disable Trap: 43 (55)<br>Search: 43 (55)<br>Listen: 43 (57)<br>Spot: 43 (55)<br>Heal: 43 (43)<br>11 free points.<br><br><br>Nifty things:<br>Uncanny dodge 6<br>12d6 sneak attack.<br>High unbuffed skills for getting unnoticed into places.<br>Skill Mastery. Takes traps of DC 75 and locks of DC 85!<br>HiPS.<br>No trap or spell with ref save should ever hit you should something go wrong.<br><br>Not so cool things:<br>Low hps.<br>Low damage.<br>Dreadful saves (except reflex) but you wont need them as you dont get noticed, right?<br>Cant do anything except get into places unnoticed. (pretty much...)<br>AC is ok for a robe wearer, but not good.<br><br>Small talk section? Yay!<br><br>Built both in leveling sheet and tested ingame, leveling module.<br>This build toyed with the rogue training room in The Halls of advanced training Deluxe for HotU.<br>I actually filled my inventory by retrieving every single trap in there...<br><br>I just wanted to make a build that was so purely 100% focused on stealth and infiltration as it possibly could.<br>And one thing that depresses me is that a combat build I made some while back had less AB than this one...<br><br>Ah yea, two more things:<br>- The dagger choice of weapon just seemed to suit the build best RP wise (as I kinda got a little into RP lately...) but use what you want as long as its finess'able.<br>- I really wanted to fit monk into this somehow and go unarmed... but I didnt make it in any reasonable way.<br><br>I'd really like some feedback on this build, how to improve its infiltration capacity and such.<br>Oh, and I think I got all the numbers right this time. Please show mercy should I be mistaken.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 07/10/07 19:29</span></i></p>
