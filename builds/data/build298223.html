Heh, seems strange that there was only one incarnation in the ECB, as I've certainly played this combination before (although we should make any Search suspect since the ECB hasn't been updated in 5 months).  I love what the 3 classes bring together, for it can find a way to deal damage to just about anything.  My only complaint about this kind of build is that it takes a long time before you get what you really want from either class-- Epic Dodge and Lasting Inspiration.  Given the way you have done it, there isn't much to be done without a drastic rewrite, but the end result is still quite good.  While the AB looks a bit low, I find it still worthwhile in the environments I call home.<br><br>When I made such a critter, I wound up going a mix of strength and charisma and said "damn" to Dexterity.  That freed me up in both start-up attribute points (more strength and charisma) and gave me an extra feat (Divine Might) by dropping Finesse.  No longer concerned with Epic Dodge acquisition, I could focus more on Bard pre-epic, and go Bard12/Rogue4/BG4.  This allowed for LI by Level 28, then finish out his career with Rogue levels to become a trap master.  With all of the skill points this guy gets, he would be a perfect trapcrafter.  Not sure if you penciled that in, but if you did disregard.  He ended up being a better damage dealer, and also was able to deliver a bit more of divine smackdown bolstered by good saves.  The AC was just as good as the dex-version, for in your current form it takes a long time before your Dex AC cancels out what one would gain from full armor.  <br><br>Nevertheless, this is still a worthy build, and certainly worthy of entry, Sneaky Sneak, though I would suggest giving this little vixen a name.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 06/29/08 23:53</span></i></p>

I have to agree about it seeming odd that this combination only popped up once before. Rogue/bard is typically seen as having good synergy, as does bard/blackguard. Also the three together is a fun RP concept. <br><br>I think the problem is what you ran into here. The character develops very late unless you go the route the dwarflord suggests and offer up your dexterity to the demons you make your deal with. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>But I like this build. Lots of RP flavor (which I love to see), and more effective in combat with your buffs than the initial AB would suggest. I may have to try this next time I play DwR.

Thank you for the kind words. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>The (real) reason I opted for a dex version is that I have this thing about trying to make bards that can cast spells even without stripping down to their underwear.  I just don't like showing of what the guys with a bit of charisma under the belt have.. well.. under the belt.. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I'm currently play testing this build on a mid magic pw and he has turned out to be surprisingly effective. The extra dex lets him use ranged weapons quite well and he has turned out to be even more fun to play then I originally thought and also a lot better then I had hoped for. <br><br>I'm quite sure that the str versions are every bit as good and probably easier to play, but I still prefer the dex boys for some reason. Just a matter of personal taste I guess.<br><br>As for a name,.. hmm.. "That cursed bard" would probably fit him quite well I think.. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
