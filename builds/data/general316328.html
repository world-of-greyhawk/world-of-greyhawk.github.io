Hey guys, I've been thinking about blowing the dust off of my old cd's and reinstalling NWN. Just wondering if any of the old timers were still around. I am hoping to be able to find a decent server or two to play on, and will probably run through the OC just to get my bearings back. It's amazing how there are just some games that you will always go back to.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.
