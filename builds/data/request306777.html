Hey guys, me again. I know I've probably asked this 800 times, but I could really use your help.<br><br>I'm trying to come up with a 30th level build that is focused around, well, necromancy. That means he will use the Summon Undead spells, etc.. You know the gig. <br><br>But I wasn't sure of what class to use, cleric of wizard? I know one thing, I would like it to be a dwarf, and another thing; Epic Spell: Mummy Dust. Also, if possible, Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy.<br><br>If anyone can lend their time, it would be greatly appreciated. Spell-casters are NOT my Forte.<br><br>Thank you!<br><br>P.S. If Cleric, spell-slinging would be preferred, but it doesn't matter if it gets the job done. <br><br>P.P.S. I'm not too sure about Pale Master.. it always seemed like a weak class to me. Especially when limited to level 30.<br><br>P.P.P.S. It's easy to see that I have no clue what I'm talking about. I will consider any suggestions. Thanks again! <br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_sleep2.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DarkInfernoo on 02/23/09 21:39</span></i></p>

I usually play my Necromancer characters as Wizards, but thats just because I dont play Clerics. That said, Clerics would probably make for a better Summoning Necro, as you could buff your Undead Minions to create Super Undead Minions. <br><br>Do you have a certain alignment in mind for this character? A level or two of Monk cheese for all the bonuses with a high WIS Cleric is always nice. The thing about Clerics is that most people dont take Spell Focuses in any school except for maybe Evocation. I think that is where the Wizard Necro would have a leg up, with all the yummy high level Necro spells.<br><br>Do you want more of a summoning Necro or an instant death, spell slinging Necro? <br><br>Clerics also have the ability to Raise the dead, which fits in nicely with the overall Necro theme.

Honestly the idea of an instant death, spell-slinging dude sounds better. Though the spell Mummy Dust is a must have for me. On my server summons are effected by alignment, and most of the <b> evil </b> summon creature spells yield undead type minions for your disposal (which are considerably stronger than the stock Nwn summons, almost like an equal level fighter). <br><br>I was thinking Lawful Evil alignment.<br><br>Thanks for the reply!<br><br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_sleep2.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DarkInfernoo on 02/23/09 22:06</span></i></p>

OK, sounds good. BTW - which PW do you play on?<br><br>Pale Master is more of a class for a Melee character, IMO. I wouldnt bother with it. Though some people will take 1 level of it for the +2 bonus to AC. Wizard 29/Pale Master 1 might be something to look in to. Unless your server has rules against only taking 1 level of any class...<br> <br>I'll try and whip something up if I get a few minutes. Kids are acting a fool at the moment. *sigh*

Here is something I put together real quick. Not sure if you have to "role play" your stats on your PW or not. This is just a basic outline to give you something to look at:<br><br>Dwarf<br>Lawful Evil<br><br>Wizard 29/Pale Master 1<br><br>STR 13 (gotta have some muscles to carry loot)<br>DEX 10 (had 2 points left over, I put them here)<br>CON 18 (you are a Dwarf, great HPs for a caster)<br>INT 17 (main stat, I had it end at 26, could get to 30)<br>WIS  8<br>CHA  6<br><br>AC 17 (naked)<br><br>Saves<br><br>Fort 17 (27 vs spells)<br>Refl 11 (21)<br>Will 17 (27)<br><br>Skills<br><br>Concen 31 (35)<br>Heal   31 (30)<br>Lore   32 (40)<br>SpellC 32 (40)<br>Tumble 15<br><br>75 Left Over<br><br>I took the Pale Master level at 6 when I did this, you can put it wherever you like, I just wanted to be able to use the 20th level of Wizard in Epic so you gain access to another Epic Bonus Feat instead of another regular one. <br><br>You get 10 pre-epic feats. I would take Spell Focus/Greater Spell Focus: Necromancy, Spell Penetration/Greater Spell Penetration, Extend Spell, Empower Spell, Maximize Spell. That is 7 of them. The other 3 are up to you. You could take Toughness to have even more HPs, never a bad thing. Not sure if Expertise/Improved Expertise works while casting on your server... I never use it though. You could also take some Save Booster feats as well, I like those.<br><br>You will have 8 Epic Feats as well. I took ESF: Necro, Epic Spell Penetration, Epic Spell: Mummy Lord, Epic Spell: Greater Ruin (seems like a good spell for a Necro), Epic Spell: Mage Armor, Armor Skin, and 2 Great INT. <br><br>You could drop the 2 Epic Spells, Epic Spell Pen, and Armor Skin and pick up 4 more Great INTs if you wanted. Higher DC on your spells and more skill points.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By galelabriel on 02/23/09 23:21</span></i></p>

I actually looked at that build earlier today, and was considering it. The problem is that it is wayyy to focused on stealth for my needs. <br><br>I would consider eliminating the pre-epic Skill Focuses in Hide and MS but I wouldn't know where to go from there, and I don't know hot to incorporate any of the epic spells.<br><br>*sigh* I'm horrible with wizards.<br><br>But it is an interesting build.<br><br>Thanks for all the help!<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_sleep2.gif">
