The server host, legolas2358, has not been active since August 5th and the server has been down since then.... The guild is in need of new server host and who would be willing to have it up 24 hrs/7 days.<br><br>Anyone want to do this?<br><br>In addition, the module will be likely to be PrC version. I am going ahead with this version instead of the older version.<br><br>But if no one want to have PrC, let me know. If more than enough people want non-prc version, I will revise the version and convert it back to regular version. Don't post here, please sent me PM concerning both server host and using PrC or non-PrC version module.<br><br>Anuis

No one want to do this?<br><br>I was hoping that someone would do it... but I guess the guild will have no place to test their characters against each other.<br><br>I guess I will go back to working on some old scripts and modules that I have never finished.<br><br>Anuis
