Its easier with an epic shadowdancer actually, since they get a bonus feat every 3 levels as opposed to an epic rogue who gets a bonus feat every 4 levels.

Personally Id use kukris as the weapon in both the elf and halfling cases, since it counts as a tiny weapon and has an excellent crit range.

But for kukris you have to give up a feat for exotic proficiency.

Ya..but you get another general feat at level 36 and another at level 39.  So if you want to delay the SC5 a bit kukris are viable.

If you can find decent Khukuris then go that route but the Leech daggers awe potentially very dangerous in the right hands, ask my friend Fred <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>-DaMouse

Hmm. I was trying to subsitute Ranger in for Harper Scout but I wasn't getting the Great Dex feats (they were not choosable).<br><br>So, why exactly the Harper Scout in this build? Is it because he has no class specific epic feats so you are allowed to choose GD?<br><br>I was also trying to get the 4 attacks (+16 BAB) with the Ranger levels so I added in a few pre-epic. <br><br>Either way, somehow it got slightly snafu'd along the way.<br><br>So, if the key to this puzzle is the Harper Scout, could someone please explain why the Harper Scout is important.

Any classes bonus feats cna be used to take epic bonus feats. For a harper scout this includes Great DEX at level 1 and 5. This gives you 2 extra great DEX feats that otherwise you wouldnt have had access to. This means that at level 25 this build has the highest DEX possible in the game. Only assassins/bards/arcane archers/harper scouts have access to great DEX as a bonus feat.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

Assassin levels where the harper scouts levels are dont give you Great DEX feats. You need to have level 14/18/22/26/30 assassin to get the great dex feats.<br><br>However for an assassin/rogue to qualify for epic dodge you need 13 levels of rogue minimum. You need 14 levels of assassin to qualify for your first great dex (bonus) feat so thats you at level 27 without even considering ranger. <br><br>The whole idea was to get SC5/ED at the earliest level, this "build" showed you how.<br><br>Personally I wouldnt use it, but then im not a fan of harper scout.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!
