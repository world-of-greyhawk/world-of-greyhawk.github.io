With his high defense of 55 natural and concelament bonus from improved invisiblity he will effectively dogde many attacks. Defense comes from the fact that he can where a Full Plate and a Tower Sheild. He can also cast the might Epic Mage armor to boost him up.

Since you will have high chr anyway you might want to take another 2-3 levels of paladin to get divine shield and/or might.  You can probally grab a couple more bab pre epic doing this as well.

I have a more melee oriented version of this build which goes Sorc 20/RDD 10/BG 10.  This nets me +4 BAB, and I also manage to get 30 Str on the build which gives me another 2 AB over your Dev. Crit. build.  <br><br>I think BG is a better choice than Paladin for a few reasons:<br><br>1) BG gets sneak attacks, Paladin doesn't.<br><br>2) with only 8 Wis, you can't cast any Paladin spells anyway, whereas BGs use spell-like abilities, so Wis doesn't matter.<br><br>3) BG has access to Taunt, which is great with a high Cha build.  Taunt reduces your opponent's AC by 6 and gives a 30% chance of spell failure, assuming you're successful.  Of course, if you choose to max Taunt, you have to take another lvl of BG, which means that you lose 1 lvl of Sorc and 1 lvl 9 spell.  <br><br>Of course, with your build, you only take 1 lvl of Paladin anyway, so it doesn't make much difference.  <br><br>The advantages of your build are that you get more caster lvls, and another 3 Epic bonus feats which allow you to get Epic spells.  Personally I prefer more melee-oriented builds, but arcane casters can be pretty powerful too.

This build is ment to be more of a magic user, that can use his sword as back up if need be.  I couldn't take any more pally levels due to the fact that my devastating critical version needs all those stuff and i can't replace any of them.

<!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;21(Sorc)-Epic Skill Focus: Discipline</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Im haveing a hard time seeing how this is possible since this is not a sorcerer class skill. Discipline is not a 20 by this point to take this feat. Thought about moveing some feats around to make it possible but that dident work only thing i can see is to take that 9th level of rdd at 17 instead of 15 to give you the 20 skill points in disc that you need to take this feat. Just a pointer for anyone wanting to use this build.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Uhdan on 12/15/08 02:03</span></i></p>

Yeah, you just have to juggle that last pre-epic RDD level at 17 or later.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
