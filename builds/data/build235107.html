Just a few quick comments:<br><br>a) Concealment <b>does not</b> stack, so you are limited to 50%<br><br>b) True seeing doesn't help at all with fighting concealed opponents and does not make up for the lack of blind fight<br><br>c) You are picking up cleric domains on the wrong lvl in your write up. Also you cannot pick up extend spell where you do.<br><br>d) Get Weapon finesse at 3rd lvl, the sooner, the better<br><br>e) Why not getting some cleric preepic? It would improve playability a lot. Say Cleric 8/Monk 12? Also why not Cleric 8/SD 4/Monk 8?<br><br>f) IIRC all the SD skills are covered by Monk, so, in your lvlup guide, I'd get the all the 5 SD lvls in at the same time. Uh, now that I look at it, <b>you cannot take ED the way you wrote it down, you need the 5th SD lvl to qualify!</b><br><br>g)You are missing the Monk bonus feat on 40th lvl (25th Monk)<br><br>h) Builds should be tested to be possible/legal before posting. If you have done so and it's just some copy and paste messing up than please edit it till you have the time, cause our moderator is missing from the boards for the time being.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 03/27/06 14:17</span></i></p>

The feats can be switched here and there...<br>mainly as kail had said weapon finesse and all the pre-epic feats...<br>server i built this dude on gave me 10 lvls to start so...<br>I kept all monk pre-epic because i wanted enough stunning fists and perfect self ASAP....<br>besides that the early cleric spells were not helping me out at all (depends on servers)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cruel_Intent on 03/27/06 14:42</span></i></p>

Uh, you haven't edited the first version as the version in the second post.<br><br>Anyhow, I'll comment the second one:<br><br>a) the single cleric lvl preepic hurts your AB. Move it up in epic or take cleric in multiples of 4 preepic to have 15 BAB at 20th lvl (now you have 14)<br><br>b) Same as above, why not going Monk 12/Cleric 8 or even Monk 8/Cleric 8/SD 4 preepic? Cleric buffs and HiPS would greatly help playability<br><br>c) Same as above, weapon finesse at 3rd lvl would help you hit things: +4 AB at 3rd lvl, +5 at 4th-5th lvl. Better than mobility I'd say.<br><br>d) Knowledge and Protection are not the best domains to choose. I'd choose betwen Trickery, War, Plant, Travel, Magic. Trickery (II and hide/MS boost) and War (Cat's Grace and AoV) would be my choices. Knowledge especially brings little to nothing.<br><br>e) from first build (edited):<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>SKILLS :<br><br><br><br>Discipline 43<br>Hide 10 <br>Listen 43<br>Move Silently 8<br>Spellcraft 41 <br>Tumble 43<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Spellcraft should be 38 or 43 with 14 INT.

I can't for the life of me see why Monk22/Cleric 13, when the split of Monk20/Cleric15 is clearly better. Pre -epic he would probably do best as Cleric12/SD4/Monk4. My guess. Depends a little on the domains, but he has no damage source other than from Cleric, to get somewhere you must kill. When you have 1d20 for damage it might start to get good, but before that?<br><br>Yeah Kail, Divine favor gives +4 at lvl  13, but you knew this, <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  .Magic Vestments, Barkskin(plant) and GMW would all benefit from 2 more cleric levels, along with durations.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

well knowledge is useful if trueseeing is changed , you can get +10spot/listen of it.<br> <br>2more cleric lvls with you give a lot more than 2monk,even if you have to put 2 pts more in wis.<br><br>prolly it might be worth it to go with kama , you can cast gmw for +5with 15cleric lvls to bypass dr and enhance it with darkfire to get some more dmg.<br><br>and get blindfight!!!

You don't use barkskin since you use stoneskin? I don't get your meaning. And stoneskin doesn't help vs opponents using +5 or better, and only for 100 hp's otherwise. Barkskin gives an AC bonus always except vs touch attacks.<br><br>The damage you list, with your gloves and at lvl 40, well 60/round ain't exactly high, but with high AC and ED it's probably enough, but lvl 40 power was not my point. You have to get there. Where do you get damage from at low levels? at least before you get some damage from Cleric.

"I have rebuilt this guy with 12 monk / 8 cleric pre-epic and i have got myself 17 BAB..."<br><br>how the ...???<br><br>well you get 15 bab preepic if you split the lvl order 12monk 8 cleric .. 15bab is the highest you can get with a combo of those 3 gloves.<br><br>since you dont need many cleric lvls , what abou you just go with 11cleric 13 rogue 16monk. you still get the max fist dmg , you loose empty body and immunty to mind spells but that you get of spells like imp invis and prot from alignment , clarity. the 7d6 sneaks will help do deal some dmg , and yoou get imp kd for free so you can sneak after you kd ed your opp.

How do you use stoneskin when you haven't got it in your spell list? Pick up magic domain then. <br><br>Still, barkskin is +5 AC, which is a lot. AC is never high enough in my experience, especially in PvP. <br><br>True seing one lvl earlier is not any big deal IMO, especially when other choices bring much better benefits. <br><br>LVL 8 spell <b>and</b> spell slots should not be given up lightly, especially when you are not losing practically anything by going Monk 20/Cl 15 instead of Monk 22/Cl 13.<br><br>Again tumble needs only 40 ranks and spellcraft 38 (or 43). You are wasting skillpoints with your current spread.<br><br>I don't get how you can have 17 BAB at 20th lvl, it's basically impossible. Test the build on a lvler module with combat debugging on, I'm confident you'll get 15 BAB as it should be.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò
