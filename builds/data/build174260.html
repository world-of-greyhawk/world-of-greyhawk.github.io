Use 23cleric/2bard/15rdd instead. <br><br>It gains you +1 ac because you get +1 ac for every 5 lvls of epic rdd. This is not stated in the manual.

The AC bonus from rdd also makes for better monk/bard/rdd,pally/bard/rdd. It would be recommended to take 15 rdd for the extra AC and 1 epic feat(epic prowess as my personal favorite). <br><br>e.i 18monk/2bard(for song)/20rdd

Instead of taking the 1st bard lvl at 21, I would wait to 22 so I can take my tumble to 25.  That will get you an extra point of AC for the remainder of the build until you make 40.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.rpgmods.net/forgottenworlds/phpBB2/" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

I play this character as a buffing fighter.  Cast empowered bull's strength, empowered endurance, empowered eagle's spendour, barkskin, extended shield of faith, protection from elements, negative energy protection, improved invisibility, death ward, darkfire, greater magic weapon, magic vestiment (twice one for shield one for armor), spell resistance, and true seeing after each rest.<br><br>before battle cast bless, prayer, aid, battletide, divine power and divine favor.  Use your divine might ability too.  Then go in and beat people up.  Recast divine favor and divine might as necessary. <br><br>of couse as you level you won't have all the spells.  Most important are darkfire, since it increases your damage considerably.  barkskin, shield of faith and magic vestiment are important to raise your ac considerably.  You can free up some equipment using these spells.  barkskin frees up a +5 natural armor amulet.  shield of faith a +5 deflection ring or cloak.  and magic vestiment gives you +5 armor and shield. divine favor adds 5 ab and 5 damage.  divine power gives +5 ab and gives an extra attack at full ab.  i always try to keep divine favor, divine might and divine power active when fighting.<br><br>Also remember that if you're playing the OC or SOA (not hordes), you won't have access to the dwarven waraxe.  Choose another weapon (bastard sword) to use instead.

It does increase the ac by 4. The even cooler part is that if you cast 3 undeaths eternal foe, the ac-bonuses stack, so that you'll be given 12 extra ac for the duration of the 3 spells...

Re: dev crit<br><br>This char was designed to be played on a server with dev crit disabled.  <br><br>If you were to go for dev crit, you'd need to spend 4 feats (cleave, great cleave, overwhelming crit, and dev crit) on top of what you already have.<br><br>I'd suggest dropping silent spell (lose lvl 9 mass heals), divine shield (takes away charges from divine might) and two great strength feats for these four.<br><br>Also choose martial weapon prof instead of exotic so you can use a good crit range weapon like rapier or scimitar.<br><br>I'd also consider dropping the cha down to 8 to start and focus entirely on str to help raise the dc on dev crit as high as possible, although it's a totally different build if you make those changes.<br><br>Re: playing from lvl 1.<br><br>I forgot to mention this in my previous post.  Use defensive casting mode once you get to level 12-13 or so.  This will prevent attacks of opportunity when you're casting.  With defensive casting mode active you'll be able to recast divine favor/power in battle, heal yourself, etc... This is especially important when you're surrounded by enemies, since if you cast there will be lots of AoOs. When playing I keep either power attack or defensive casting mode active at all times.

If the character is a cleric, I recomend keeping silent spell.  Lvl 6 AND 7 harms are very nice.  I would drop empowered spell first.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.rpgmods.net/forgottenworlds/phpBB2/" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

Even if you are playing on a world with dissabled dev crit, cleave and great cleave (even overwhelming crit for that matter) are excellent, almost necessary feats for a melee char IMO.
