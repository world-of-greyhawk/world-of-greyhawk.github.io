The basic premise behind this build is to make a spellsword using the Harper Scout class.  I couldn't find a similar build, so at least this one is original, if not interesting.  Also, as an interesting side effect, this build gets three sets of spells to use, which is handy when resting is restricted or when a little more power is needed.  Also, due to leveling carefully, there is no XP penalty, although this forces us to wait until very late in the build to get any tumble, but such is the price paid for getting tumble to 40 instead of 20.  Should be alright without tumble anyways.<br><br>Harper Spellsword<br>Paladin 17, Sorcerer 18, Harper Scout 5<br><br><b>playable 1 to 40, PvM</b><br><br>(Human)<br>alignment: lawful good<br><br>STR 14 to 26<br>DEX 8<br>CON 14<br>INT 14<br>WIS 14<br>CHA 14 to 20<br><br>all points go into Strength.<br><br>1 )Paladin1 Power Attack, Weap Foc: Scimitar<br>2 )Paladin2<br>3 )Paladin3 Divine Power<br>4 )Paladin4<br>5 )Sorcerer1<br>6 )Sorcerer2 Still Spell<br>7 )Paladin5<br>8 )Sorcerer3<br>9 )Paladin6 Divine Shield<br>10)Paladin7<br>11)Paladin8<br>12)Paladin9 Impr Crit: Scimitar<br>13)Paladin10<br>14)Paladin11<br>15)Sorcerer4 Iron Will<br>16)Paladin12<br>17)Paladin13<br>18)Paladin14 Alertness<br>19)Paladin15<br>20)Paladin16<br>21)Sorcerer5 Great Cha I<br>22)Sorcerer6<br>23)Sorcerer7<br>24)Sorcerer8 Great Cha II<br>25)Sorcerer9<br>26)Sorcerer10<br>27)Sorcerer11 Great Cha III<br>28)Sorcerer12<br>29)Sorcerer13<br>30)Sorcerer14 Great Cha IV<br>31)Sorcerer15<br>32)HS1 Great Cha V<br>33)HS2 EWF: Scimitar<br>34)HS3<br>35)HS4<br>36)Sorcerer16 Great Str I<br>37)Sorcerer17<br>38)HS5 Great Cha VI<br>39)Sorcerer18 Great Str II<br>40)Paladin17<br><br><br>Skills:<br>Concentration 43<br>Discipline 43<br>Spellcraft 38 (40 with INT)<br>Tumble 40<br>Lore 6<br>Persuade 8<br>Search 4 (8 cross-classed)<br>Taunt 39 (44 with CHA)<br><br>AB: 39/34/29/24<br>seems a little low, but with the suggested spells below, this can be increased to around mid to low 40's.  and those enhancements should stack with +whatever weapons.  also don't forget taunt, which should help out a bit as well.<br><br>Damage: 1-6 + 8 (15-20/x2)<br>This can easily be boosted with paladin and sorcerer spells/abilities.  also keen edge gives a great crit range, which helps alot.<br><br>AC: naked is 17, in full plate with a tower shield its 28.  when buffed with HS Cat's Grace (with a little luck) hits 30.<br><br>Saves:<br>Fort 28(36)<br>Refl 20(28)<br>Will 28(36)(+2 from Llira's Heart), Immune to Fear<br><br>Saves aren't too bad, considering no plan was made to increase them.

very innovative and I think interesting <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>its a pity its so tight for feats<br>there are things it would be nice to have like Auto-Still I-III and Armour Skin but I can't see a way to get them w/o dropping the 2 GRT STR and 2 of the GRT CHA feats and reallocating ability increases from STR to CHA and ending up 4 STR lower<br>not sure if its worth doing that<br>the Harper Scout Cat's Grace can be stacked with 1 from sorcerer so you'll be able to get DEX to 12 with no problem<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

Christian, nice concept. Looks similar to one I was working on a while back, but never finished. Anyway, just a minor point about the XP penalty issue: your build is Human. Harper Scout is a prestige class. Therefore, you've no worries about XP penalties. You can take HS much earlier if you want.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

It's actually impossible for a human to have an XP penalty unless you have 3 base classes.  Basically, look at all your classes, cross out the prestige classes, then cross out the favored classes (or, for humans and half-elves, the class with the most levels at the time), and just look at what's left over to determine if you have an XP penalty.  In this build, which I assume is human, you would cross out harper scout (prestige class) and whichever of your other classes is higher at the time, leaving you with only one class to consider.  So, no XP penalty ever.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;i was considering skipping HS for RDD, but then level numbers and order would be different.  really a totally different build altogether.  and it has been done by many others better i, in ways better than i could. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     i just try to be different...not better, unfortunately, just different.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Yeah, I wasn't suggesting you actually switch to RDD, as this build was clearly designed to be an alternative to the "classic" pal/sorc/RDD build.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 08/30/05 18:33</span></i></p>

You only get an XP penalty if you have 2 or more core classes that are more than 1 level apart. Prestige classes don't count at all when calculating XP penalties, and your race's favored class is also not considered.<br><br>A Human character's favored class is whichever has the most levels. In your build, you wouldn't even consider the HS class, as it's a prestige class and your highest levelled class wouldn't count (Pally or SOR, whichever had the most levels), so there's no way for you to possibly get a penalty with this build, no matter how you levelled it.<br><br>This would allow you to take HS at level 22 if you wanted, which gives you the opportunity to max Tumble 10 levels sooner. (You could also take HS pre-epic, but it would mean you'd have to use the bonus feat for Favored Enemy instead of GRT CHA, so not a good option).<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

i agree with you, ama, that would be a good exchange.  some more AC is nice, but then again, with a variety of spells focusing on damage reduction and magical damage shields, its not that necessary.  but i think that, given adding epic prowess would maintain the AB, i think this is a good idea. +1 damage will not be missed.<br><br>thanks for the suggestion!<br><br>-c
