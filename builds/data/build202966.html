Just an interesting little idea that turned out surprisingly better than anticipated. What about all those mobs that keep hitting your character with elemental damages? Well, the Master of resistance can handle almost anything they throw at him. With a bit of Bard Song, the Bard's skill set, and all those Fighter bonus feats, he gets some good tools to handle himself in melee as well. Hit points are good, AC is quite acceptable, he has a bit of DR, and even his saves aren't that bad. And, he's a Dwarf!<br><br><b>Playable from level 1, PvM</b><br><br>FTR 22/Bard 8/RDD 10<br><br>Dwarf, any non-lawful<br><br>STR 16 (32)<br>DEX 12<br>CON 18 (22)<br>INT 14 (16)<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 6 (8)<br><br>1 )FTR1: Weapon Focus/ Luck of Heroes<br>2 )Bard1<br>3 )FTR2: Lightning Reflexes/ Knockdown<br>4 )FTR3: STR (17)<br>5 )FTR4: Weapon Specialization<br>6 )RDD1: Iron Will<br>7 )Bard2<br>8 )RDD2: STR (20)<br>9 )RDD3: Blind Fight<br>10)RDD4<br>11)RDD5<br>12)Bard3: Improved Critical/ STR (23)<br>13)RDD6<br>14)RDD7<br>15)RDD8: Improved Knockdown<br>16)FTR5: STR (24)<br>17)Bard4<br>18)FTR6: Toughness/ Power Attack<br>19)FTR7<br>20)FTR8: Cleave/ CON (21)<br><br>21)RDD9: Epic Energy Resistance:Acid<br>22)Bard5<br>23)RDD10<br>24)FTR9: Epic Skill Focus:Taunt/ CON (22)<br>25)FTR10: Epic Weapon Focus<br>26)FTR11<br>27)Bard6: Epic Energy Resistance:Acid<br>28)FTR12: Epic Prowess/ STR (29)<br>29)FTR13<br>30)FTR14: Epic Energy Resistance:Sonic/ Damage Reduction I<br>31)FTR15<br>32)Bard7: STR (30)<br>33)FTR16: Epic Energy Resistance:Sonic/ Damage Reduction II<br>34)FTR17<br>35)FTR18: Damage Reduction III<br>36)FTR19: Epic Energy Resistance:Elecrical/ STR (31)<br>37)Bard7:<br>38)FTR20: Armor Skin<br>39)FTR21: Epic Energy Resistance:Electrical<br>40)FTR22: Epic Weapon Specialization/ STR (32)<br><br>Max HPs: 622<br><br>Skills:<br><br>Tumble: 40<br>UMD: 40<br>Spellcraft: 37<br>Discipline: 43<br>Lore: 8<br>Taunt: 43<br>12 points left over<br><br>Naked AC: 25, 36 with mundane plate and shield.<br><br>Immune to fire<br>20/- resistance to Acid, Sonic, and Electrical<br>9/- Damage Reduction<br><br>Unbuffed AB: +42<br><br>Saves (vs spells):<br>Fort: 30 (40)<br>Refl: 22 (32)<br>Will: 24 (34)<br><br>He gets no spells due to low CHA, but that's not the focus of the build.

A frontliner in any party.  Ideal for PvM environments.  There clearly is a niche for characters like this.  I'm pleasantly surprised by how decent his saves are on top of the Resistances, DR, and high hitpoints.  Loss of spells is lamentable, but as you state, it's not the point, and he can compensate with UMD to cast any buffs or Imp Invis's he needs to become the ultimate god of war.<br><br>Curiosity build?

Just a note on the build: you could easily replace Epic Skill Focus:Taunt with Epic Energy Resistance:Cold. This would give the build 10/- resistance to cold as well. It's something that the Dwarflord brought to my attention and I think it's a good idea. Certainly, it's in keeping with the concept of the build. Thanks for that, Grizz.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

An alternate version, like I have on a PW, is to take PM instead of RDD.  You loose 4 AB and DMG from the STR loss, a few skill points, 40hp, and 100% immunity to fire (you can take Epic Energy Resistance - Fire to get enough to cover flame weapon, darkfire, etc. though) BUT, you are immune to crits and sneaks which really pays off in melee battle.<br><br>I know these builds aren't based off items, but when you couple natural energy resistance and Epic Damage Reduction with items available in most PW's (belts, rings, etc.), you really do become resistance to most melee damage.

That is indeed unfortunate.  Using your above concept I have a rough mock up of a Fighter 8/Defender 22/CoT 10 with DR 24/- and 20/- for fire/cold/sonic/acid and lightening.  Could have had 4 of the 5 "elemental" at 25/- if they stacked.  Even with 30 BAB, I could only get the strength up to 24, so I don't think he would be able to hit a cow's arse with a banjo, even with WF, EWF and EWS.  Oh well.<br>Apologies for hi-jacking your thread.

You'd have good saves to go along with it. Even with only 24 STR, that's an AB of +41 with a mundane weapon, and only 1 less AB than my Resistance build. Not all that bad in most PvM environments (and on par with many builds posted here).

I have tested this in a PvP arena, (with fire) and sorry guys, it doesn't stack. That's really lame, because then the feat taken pre-epic disappears. Well, that's how it worked a year back or so. It might have been patched up now.

Hello All,<br><br>I really like this build but have a question or two:<br><br>I read the post from  mphacon  asking  “Just out of interest does the Resist Energy Feat stack with Epic Energy Resistance? So you could have... “ the answered seems to be – no.  <br><br>And the post from GoVols “is it stacks with the item with the highest amount. If you have a ring with 5/- Acid and a shield with 10/- Acid, you would have 10 + your natural resist to Acid.” <br><br><br>I was wondering:<br><br>A) <br>If you  have say the epic acid resistance 20 and then had an item such as a ring that had acid resistance 5 would the feat and items stack for 25 resistance to acid or as with items does the 20 take priority and only give 20?<br><br>B) <br>If you also had an item which gave damage soak 5 would it stack with the epic damage resistance giving a total of 14 or again highest wins?<br><br><br>Tks in advanced.

I, too, have heard about the stacking situation, but whatever: this is (in my humble opionion) a very nice build, which shoud do very well in not only pvm but in particular pve environs --- saves are wonderful, and so overlooked (being a melee fan vs.pally fan meself, so hard to choose, it is at times, and yet, Cinn, you darn well upped and did it again and showed us the virtues of both w.o the pally -- awesome, and nice twist to all that what has come before. Nice build, and btw, in case you're wondering, in b.w countries and heck taking your amazing advice into consideration (stay tuned folks -- should see what Cinn and I got planned, as in, we got a build coming up, and all good) in the meantime, I like (as in, Really LIKE) this build alot -- serves a niche in the pve in particular market and then some, and all good (at least if you wanna solo, w.o pally etc.  -- well done, once again, and a nice twist/additition to what's come before - thanks for this, Cinn.
