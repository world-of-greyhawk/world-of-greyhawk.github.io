hmm..   i was comparing this with the exalted sorc, and it seems to be almost identical.  The exalted sorc has combat casting and improved combat casting which would make casting in combat a hell of alot safer! (sorry bout that, had to throw it in).  Other than that, the only difference is that exaltd takes 4 great charisma and this one takes 6...  imho, its a HUGE improvement.<br><br>Note: i'm all for variations on a theme (god knows ive done it plenty), but when the build you pilfer is posted on the "official" forum, try to take it to another lvl... especially when you copy it from a fantastic builder, like cdaulepp.  <br><br>Nice try though<br><br>peace

Exalted Sorceress also gets Epic Skill Focus Discipline and Improved Expertise, whereas this one specialises in two spell schools instead of just Necromancy. ES also has slightly different starting skills.<br><br>This one seems more like a "classic" nuke-everything-in-sight sorcerer, while Exalted Sorceress is more focused on nuking everything in sight and being able to go solo through pretty much anything.

Well, I'm not sure which one was first, since this one is a classic build on the server I play on.

Yes, just so you know, Stephen Hawking is one of the "original" builders...One of the first Bard/Fighter/RDD builds (if not the first) was his as well, with some later players varying it to their tastes (Lockindal specifically credits Stephen Hawking in his build of that type on the site).  I find it highly doubtful that he would just take some build of the website, make minor alterations, and publish it as his own, so you should probably not be so quick to call someone a thief before you have all the facts...<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 04/06/05 19:45</span></i></p>

doesn't sorc have great cha on its bonus list with one of the latest patches?  You could drop auto still feats and one other to get all 10 great cha feats for higher dcs.<br><br>I'm guessing that this wasn't possible when this build was designed, since it is a relatively recent development.

I would assume he wanted the sorc to be midly munchy and wear heavy armor <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  since he's only gain 2DC from 4 great CHA feats but a hell of a lot of AC from Still Spell and Auto Still 1-3<br><br>-DaMouse

i play a similar build to this, in that i also take 2 schools ESFed.  my twist is to keep everything the same, except drop empower, and take ESF discipline.  i also keep expertise and improved expertise instead of 2 great chr feats.  any thoughts on my variation?

ESF: Discipline is completely useless, Empower Spell is absolutely better.

Simple, your Discipline on an 8 STR build is crap before and after taking ESF: Discipline, it's totally useless against any real melee enemy, no matter what you do, pretty much.<br><br>Empowered Spells are very useful, since they use slots 2 levels higher, instead of 3 o Maximize, and considering Empowered is 50% stronger its effective damage compared against Maximized is pretty good, I prefer a roll that can be stronger than a set damage.<br><br>What are you fighting could be important, Empowered IGMS is way more useful than Horrid Wilting against a single opponent, and what happened to all your other slots? only three spells isn't that much of a really prepared tactic.<br><br>At any rate, you don't want Empowered? you don't take it, but ESF: Discipline is a complete waste for this build, I recommend choosing something else.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Discipline still has a place for 8 and 10 strength mages, with or without Epic Skill Foci.  The "All or None" theory usually is based upon creatures of equal skill or value with max AB and so on.  The reality of the matter is that there are many lesser creatures in the game, with KD or Called Shot or Disarm, and that the Mage could have a reasonable chance of resisting attempts from these guys.  95% of the time the KDer isn't going to be a 40th level PvP Weapon Master.  I routinely still put some points into Discipline with my Wizards (because they can afford to), and I smile slightly when I that Bugbear Battlerager tries to knock me off my feat and I see the floating "resisted" text fly up.

Hard call, I'm not into "all or nothing" on about every thing... in a Sorcerer 38 / Paladin 1 / Monk 1 build made for PvM you wouldn't take Monk and Paladin until level 40 for skilldumps, you'd take them pretty soon to get to use Evasion and the saves while you level up, so your base skill Discipline would be a max of 21, perhaps with a nice score pre-epic if you manage your levels well, but low an all epic levels for sure. If you do take Monk at level 40 for skilldump Discipline and Tumble then it's clearly a PvP build, you wouldn't wait all your leveling to take Evasion, and in PvP 8 STR won't let your Discipline work effectively, Discipline has no place here IMO, besides mages hardly need Discipline to avoid Knockdowns, using Premonition and Mestil's Acid Sheath Knockdowns don't matter much, getting Disarmed is no big deal for a caster, and Called Shot won't matter much either... perhaps I'm the only guy who buffs himself all the time? I'm very cautious to do so.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 10/07/07 00:51</span></i></p>

When you're flat on your ***, surrounded by several STR-based two-handed weapon-wielding mobs all flailing on you with 4 attacks per round at +4 to hit because you're prone, your Premonition will get eaten away pretty quickly. Damage shields? Yep, they're nice until that NPC mage in the background decides to come out of GS and debuff you or the mobs happen to have some energy resistance to fire and/or acid. Even if you're fully buffed, being knocked down can still be a serious threat to your health.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
