A few things you may want to add are things like base saves, Playable 1-40, and intended environment.  <br><br>As far as the build goes, I would suggest maybe spell foci in a particular school of magic.  That, or maybe finding a way to get Epic spells.  You could actually focus the Sorcerer on the no-save/direct damage spells like Ikes Yikes and what-not, and thus leave Charisma at 20, and make a more concerted effort on the Intelligence front to pump up your DCs in other spells.  You could then go Sorc18/Wiz22, or Sorc19/Wiz21 so that you could squeeze a few Epic Spells out of the whole process.  <br><br>Lowering the Charisma by 6 could consequently raise your Int to at least 30 with room for 1-2 Epic spells, and maybe an Epic Spell Focus.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Your second paragraph above is the BEST thing in the post!  FInally a new builder with a sense of humor!  I guess you read the cleric/wiz thread recently?  LOL<br><br>Listen to griz.  He can take virtually ANY build and make it playable.  I think he may be able to even make the Crafting machine by cdaeulepp playable!!  (k, maybe not as that build IS perfect as it!).<br><br>What's next?  the bard20/sorc20 build?  I did that one one time.  Notice how i never posted it?  It had crazy synergy, but stupid end result.

Hey Gramatta, not bad! I know you don't mean for this guy to be a good PVPer, but I play the HOTU campaign (more for a lack of better alternatives than anything else) and the big boss Mephistopheles is immune to magical damage. Also, doesn't the Shield spell make characters immune to all these silent, empowered, maximized or still Magic Missiles? Also, Grizzled Dwarflord's advice is PHENOMENAL. Get yourseld Epic Mage Armor and Epic Warding to improve your melee defenses a bit, because 8 DEX is quite low for a non-armored character.<br><br>@ Thax<br><br>NOW I REMEMBER WHERE I HAD SEEN YOUR NICK!! I knew it was familiar! The Shadow Dragon in the Amaunator Temple in BG II. Good times, good times, what a CLASSIC! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Take it EZ!

I've actually played a build like this years ago while yes it is surprisingly fun to have an immense ammount of spells and nowhere near enough quickbar slots for all of the said spells it's just a shame a decent ammount of spell resistance cripples it

But then you might want some AoE spells that apply full damage against the target.  Horrid wiltering for one (evasion doesn't help against it).  And if there are immunities to death magic and mind spells try a few prismatic sprays (same school as Isaac's) for a chance against each mob member of instant death (unless they have immunity to evocation, prismatic spray, or 7th level spells).
