I think that a ftr(12)/wm(25)/wiz(3) focused on a large weapon (so str based) can get you good AB and, with the wiz levels, you can scribe true strike and cast it from scrolls. Or waste two feats and get still spell and auto-still I<br><br>Tell us if you can scribe scrolls.<br>_________________<br>HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh.

This one is a disarmer, no more.<br><br>I doubt he would be any good for PvP:<br>- No damage reduction<br>- No high HP<br>- His saves are crap (He would get mincemeated if he has to resist a dev. Critical.)<br>- He is using a greatsword, so he will have low armor class although the tumble ranks.<br>- He isn't focused on discipline, He is currently at 54 (with str bonus), not bad IMHO, but he could be better.<br><br>I made him for High AB, his AB with a mundane Greatsword is 52, not bad IMHO. He can also scribe true strike scrolls he should be able to cast.<br><br>He also has a decent devastating critical with a base DC of 42.<br><br>If you still want to play him you can switch to a scimitar, maximizing your critical range (and chances of dev-crit) and being able to use a shield (any more AC can help).<br><br>Here he goes:<br><br>Fighter(14), Weapon Master(25), Wizard(1), Half-Orc<br><br>STR: 18 (34)<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 13<br>CHA: 6<br><br>01: Fighter(1): Power Attack, Cleave, Discipline(4), Save(8)<br>02: Fighter(2): Weapon Focus: Greatsword, Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>03: Fighter(3): Dodge, Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>04: Fighter(4): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Greatsword, (STR=19), Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>05: Fighter(5): Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>06: Fighter(6): Mobility, Spring Attack, Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>07: Fighter(7): Discipline(1), Tumble(5)<br>08: Fighter(8): STR+1, Expertise, (STR=20), Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>09: Fighter(9): Whirlwind Attack, Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>10: Fighter(10): Improved Critical: Greatsword, Discipline(1), Intimidate(4)<br>11: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Greatsword, Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>12: Weapon Master(2): STR+1, Blind Fight, (STR=21), Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>13: Weapon Master(3): Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>14: Weapon Master(4): Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>15: Weapon Master(5): Disarm, Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>16: Weapon Master(6): STR+1, (STR=22), Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>17: Weapon Master(7): Discipline(1), Tumble(5)<br>18: Fighter(11): Improved Disarm, Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>19: Fighter(12): Great Cleave, Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>20: Fighter(13): STR+1, (STR=23), Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>21: Fighter(14): Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword, Epic Weapon Specialization: Greatsword, Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>22: Weapon Master(8): Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>23: Weapon Master(9): Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>24: Weapon Master(10): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR=25), Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>25: Weapon Master(11): Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>26: Weapon Master(12): Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>27: Weapon Master(13): Great Strength II, Overwhelming Critical: Greatsword, (STR=26), Discipline(1), Tumble(5)<br>28: Weapon Master(14): STR+1, (STR=27), Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>29: Weapon Master(15): Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>30: Weapon Master(16): Great Strength III, Devastating Critical: Greatsword, (STR=28), Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>31: Weapon Master(17): Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>32: Weapon Master(18): STR+1, (STR=29), Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>33: Weapon Master(19): Great Strength IV, Epic Prowess, (STR=30), Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>34: Weapon Master(20): Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>35: Weapon Master(21): Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>36: Weapon Master(22): STR+1, Great Strength V, Armor Skin, (STR=32), Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>37: Weapon Master(23): Discipline(1), Tumble(5)<br>38: Weapon Master(24): Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>39: Weapon Master(25): Great Strength VI, Epic Toughness I, (STR=33), Discipline(1), Save(2)<br>40: Wizard(1): STR+1, (STR=34), Spellcraft(39)<br><br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 22/15/21 [+8 vs spells]<br><br>Discipline 42(54)<br>Intimidate 4(2)<br>Spellcraft 39(40)<br>Tumble 20(22)<br><br>*Edit* Tried to make it more readable.

Good luck. I don't think he will work well on PvP, mostly because his crappy saves.<br><br>If you plan PvPing try getting as many fortitude save boosting gear as possible or you wont be able to survive a single devastating critical. Also a bit of damage reduction could be fine.<br><br>If disarm works like I think (Something like AB roll vs discipline skill) he would be able to disarm people better than most others, mostly because your AB is good for melee (Very good IMHO) and you are using a BIG weapon. And.. an unarmed enemy wont be able to dev. crit you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  (Unless he is a monk).<br><br>Tell us if it worked properly <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh.

I think the thing with the level 9 arcane spells suffering from no arcane spell failure is a bug, Ive reported this to bioware before.

Ive tested this out with a lv 20 wizard 19/ ftr 1 wearing full plate and a tower shield, all the lv 9 spells can be cast with no chance of arcane spell failure from my experience (although the game was on patch 1.64 when i last tested this).<br><br><br>Ok, just tested it again, and it does seem to work properly, good spot Stravinsky, I guess I should stick to non casters <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By M1ke47 on 07/20/05 22:18</span></i></p>
