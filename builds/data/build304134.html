The point of this character is pretty basic. Sneak up to a loner, (It's best to go after those who stray from the group), and IKD/Stun Fist them to death. Your Crippling Strike should encumber most fighter-types in no time, causing their AB and damage to drop rapidly as well as their ability to run away. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">     Use your speed to your advantage. If things get to sticky, run around a corner and go into hide, your fast speed makes exploiting Shadowdancer near pointless as it seems like a waste of a level at this point.<br><br>This is my first build here.<br><br><b> The Crippling Fist Fighter </b><br>13 Rogue / 27 Monk.<br>Elf, Any Lawful. {Lawful Neutral recommended to avoid smite)<br>Playable and Tested for PvP 1-40, although I can see it working rather well in PvM as well.<br><br><b>Starting Stats </b><br> All points go into Dex.<br>Str8<br>Dex18 (34)<br>Con12<br>Int10<br>Wis14<br>Cha8<br><br>Hitpoints, 374<br>Skillpoints, 232<br>Saving Throws, Fort23, Reflex36, Will22<br>BAB, 25<br>Mundane AB, +41/+38/+35/+32/+29<br>Mundane AC, 39<br><br><b> Skills </b><br>Appraise22,(22)<br>Discipline42,(41)<br>Hide42,(55)<br>Listen42,(47)<br>Move Silently,42(55)<br>Tumble,42(55)<br><br>You can easily drop Appraise or discipline in exchange for UMD.

Well, addressing the XP penalty, I see no real reason to take Elf here, Half-Elf, Human and Halfing would avoid XP penalty.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;You can easily drop Appraise or discipline in exchange for UMD.

I'd drop it, no matter for what.<br><br>I'm worried about your damage output, with 8 STR and only 13 Rogue, your base damage is lowish and your sneak attack is rather weak too. I would drop several monk levels, after Rogue level 15 you can grab Improved Sneak Attack with Rogue levels in epics, so with a Monk 21 / Rogue 19 spread you can take up to Improved Sneak attack VII (at levels 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and bonus feats at levels 16 and 19), not that you need to take all your epic feats on it, but at least two or three would be nice. A Monk 21 / Rogue 19 with Improved Sneak Attack IV for example, would make 14d6 sneak attack, much better than what you do now.<br><br>There's a mistake in your feat spread, the Monk bonus feat is at monk level 25, not 24.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Nice idea; however, I do agree with the damage comment. This character's strength would be a concern. I know a high level monk has 1d20 for hand based attacks but your stun DC isn't that high and 20 points of damage is nothing to some tanks.

Some of your complaints may stem from the fact that your starting stats appear to be missing 6 points.  Now I've been known to botch simple math like it's nobody's business, but methinks you shorted this guy 6 points, which seems like something to pump into strength.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I believe starting Dex is meant to be 20. He's adding 14 points to it (10 from lvl up and 4 Great Dexes) and ending at 34, so either the strating score is wrong, either the final one is.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die
