Actually, after testing, #3 should be of these the first damage reduction effect applied is used (the absorption is not taken into consideration).

I'd say it's still wise to stack spells in case someone throws a dispel at you, or one of the given spells absorbs it's capacity of damage and drops.

People ask too many times how DR works, you should test it yourself to be certain.<br><br>DRs don't stack, only one will take effect, and it will be <b>the one that covers for the most amount of damage</b> <i>against the hit you're recieving</i>, as simply as that. A lot of different examples can be made on "what that means" when put into game terms but that's a bit unnecesary methinks.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 09/27/09 05:15</span></i></p>

For example, if you had premonition with 1 point remaining, and greater stoneskin up, the blow dealt would go against premonition (thus having damage reduced by only one) instead of greater stoneskin (which could reduce it by 20).

Well, true, that's because the game won't check how many points are left in your DR source, it assumes it's infinite. I think that was not programmed thinking you would have several spell DRs, since it works perfectly for base DRs which don't expire. The DR given by Premonition was the one that "should" work the best in that case, so that's why Premonition is the one used, you just had bad luck that your DR points weren't enough. <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;...when the absorption is lower than the reduction the reduction is still the determining force. </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Not precisely either. There are cases when a lower reduction with higher absorption takes place, but that would be to have an item with 10/+3 plus 6/- for example, maybe a Dwarven Defender with a belt or something. If you recieve a hit by a +2 weapon, you would resist 10 damage, not 6, even though 6/- has a higher reduction value. The thing with spells is that the higher level spell has a higher reduction and an equal or better absorption (or some other combination where one spell has an advantage over the other, I don't know all the DR spell descriptions), so the game decides by the value of the #/# without taking into account how many points you have left.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 09/27/09 18:34</span></i></p>
