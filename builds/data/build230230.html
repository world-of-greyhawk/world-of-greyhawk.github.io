<b>Righteously and easy walking the narrow path 1-40 PvM. Should be good for PvP most of his life, at least group PvP</b><br><br>Colonel Addams regrouped his troops. They were wounded and in disarray, but somehow ready. The attackers had withdrawn to regroup after their desperate defense, but he knew the next assault would be the fatal. Their enemies were only regrouping to maximise their efficiency, and minimise losses. All of the defenses were mostly broken, and most of his soldiers wounded or dead. They refreshed themselves and re-equipped. They bandaged up the wounded and made them ready for the last stand, hoping to buy enough time for his townspeople to get away, though in his heart he knew they wouldn't. Their town was the trade center of the region, and much of the army was away to escort the King's treasure transport. He sighed and silently cursed his King. His greed would cost many tax-payers lives, and the city would be a pillaged ruin very soon.<br><br>He had mustered his sorry bunch of soldiers, highly trained, but weary and wounded. Still, he saw determination in them. He knew many good men were lost today, and more would still go. The army of Goblins, Orcs and even a few giants would massacre them. <i>"what has happened here?"</i> he suddenly heard a deep, clear voice ask. the voice held great power in it, he could almost feel it. He turned around and saw an old man. despite his age, he seemed healthy, and his psoture was straight and proud. His gaze was strong, and his eyes held strength unlike any he had ever encountered. He wore simple robes and carried only with him a staff. Addams recognized the symbol on his robes, and knew this was a Protector. The group called itself Faith Protectors and helped the people all over the land vs great dangers.<br><br>Addams quickly explained their peril, hoping the Protector could help them somewhat. The old man told them to prepare, and await his signal. He entered the last remining tower and prepared for the onslaught. They heard his pryers and understood it was protections. He had some sort of divine radiance about him and his staff was blazing in flames. a few minutes later the top of the hill above the city became alive with foul creatures. the approached the city in a mad charge. When they closed on the city a wall of whirling blades appeared in front of them, ripping the front ranks to pieces. Acid rain started to fall on them seconds later, and howls of pain were heard all over the battlefield. Giving them no pause, columns of divine fires struck down from the heavens accompanied by hails of ice and stone. New walls of whirling blades of Death appeared amongst their broken ranks. they were disorganized and severely crippled. The Protector prepared his word of Faith to make ready for the soldiers to finish their enemy off.<br><br>One of the giants, badly wounded by the acid rain, realized the threat were from the man in the Tower and with a desperate feat of strength threw a huge boulder at him. The boulder crashed into the top of the tower and tore it apart. Addams saw the tower with the Protector crumbling to pieces and collapsing from the force of the boulder. His immediate thought was for the old man, but he had no time. his combat instincts kicked in and he yelled the order. <i>"Charge!!! Press them into those blade walls! Siege crew, hit that giant!"</i> The two remaining ballista's fired two huge spears which caught the giant in the chest, quickly folowed by dozens of arrows, each drawing a drop of blood. The giant fell backwards onto his comrades, and died shortly after.<br><br>Strengthened by the massive damage that had been done to their enemies, and fueled by hate, anger and fear the city soldiers quickly gained the upper hand on their disorganized foe and either killed them or pressed them into the protectors blade barriers. after the battle Addams sought out the ruined tower and managed to dig the old man out. He saw several of his bones were broken, but he could feel a faint breath. He called for the city healers to take care of him, perhaps he would survive.<br><br>The old man had saved the entire city and it's population. Addams knew he had to seek out the Faith Protectors and try to join their ranks. He owed the old man who unfaltering risked, and may still loose, his life for them.<br>--------<br><br>My take on a caster cleric. It has been done in different variations, but the Faith Protector is my take on it.

Just wondering, why Fighter and not CoT in this instance?<br><br>You aren't opting for WSpec or EWSpec, so I don't see the benefit of Fighter. Epic Prowess is a bit of a waste when your base AB is so low anyway. You could swap CoT in gaining +2 to all saves, Smite Evil and lose the EP.

Epic prowess helps with the ranged attack to. Fighter nets more feats, that's why. CoT is just as viable if not more. But I wanted those 3 feats to at least make combat presence as good as possible without hitting spell ability.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

You could also take the first monk level much earlier. It will cost you 1 point of BAB (unless you also take 3 fighter levels pre-epic), but buffed AB with DP will be the same. Doing so will let you get the WIS AC boost earlier, plus the monk feats (cleave, flurry, etc.), an early tumble dump, and put the WF/EWF on kama, letting you take the monk attack progression. Well worth 1 point of unbuffed BAB, IMO.<br><br>TM

I really don't have any generic epic feat to spare for EWS, that would be great WIS then. Aura of vitality is sound advice, the choice of domains is a tough one, I like the Magic one in this guy though.<br><br>Hm, no ICC? I took it in my head <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  . Expertise would definitly be better, not enough INT for IMP Exp.<br><br>Monk is for skilldumps mostly (aside from WIS AC), so looking at it 2 would probably suffice. If you loose 1 unbuffed BAB/AB, you loose 1 buffed since he hits the CAP. But it isn't a big deal, since he uses melee as backup for clearing weaker mobs or finishing off hurt opponents so it might be worthwhile. Just note that plate (and shield) is just as good until he reaches a certain point, depending on the environment. Kama is an ok choice for most people, not for me. The picture becomes totally wrong. Kama is for monk heavy or cheesy Weapon masters. I have the vision of my builds in my head, see the story, it would be weird.<br><br>Thanks for helpful feedback everyone.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.
