I don't often play Rangers, as I couldn't come up with a build that I liked. However, I discovered I was playing them wrong (for me, at least) since I was always trying to make them DEX-based. This build is a STR-based Ranger and I think it's much more effective than any DEX-based build I've come up with. Thanks to Grizzled_Dwarflord for much helpful input.<br><br><b>Playable from 1 to 40, PvM</b><br><br>The Banestalker<br><br>RGR 30/FTR 4/Rogue 6<br><br>Human, any alignment<br><br>STR 16 (30)<br>DEX 10<br>CON 14<br>INT 14<br>WIS 14<br>CHA 8<br><br>1 )RGR1: Favored Enemy I/ Weapon Focus:Something Big/ Luck of Heroes<br>2 )FTR1: Knockdown<br>3 )RGR2: Blind Fight<br>4 )RGR3: STR (17)<br>5 )RGR4<br>6 )RGR5: Expertise/ Favored Enemy II<br>7 )Rogue1<br>8 )RGR6: STR (18)<br>9 )RGR7: Improved Knockdown<br>10)RGR8<br>11)RGR9<br>12)Rogue2: Improved Critical:Something Big/ STR (19)<br>13)RGR10: Favored Enemy III<br>14)RGR11<br>15)RGR12: Iron Will<br>16)RGR13/ STR (20)<br>17)Rogue3<br>18)RGR13: Toughness<br>19)RGR15: Favored Enemy IV<br>20)RGR16: STR (21)<br><br>21)FTR2: GRT STR I (22)/ Epic Weapon Focus:Something Big<br>22)RGR17<br>23)FTR3<br>24)FTR4: Weapon Specialization/ Epic Weapon Specialization/ STR (23)<br>25)RGR18<br>26)RGR19<br>27)Rogue4: Armor Skin<br>28)RGR20: Favored Enemy V/ STR (24)<br>29)RGR21<br>30)RGR22: Bane of Enemies<br>31)RGR23: Epic Prowess<br>32)RGR24: STR (25)<br>33)RGR25: GRT STR II (26)/ Favored Enemy VI<br>34)RGR26: Favored Enemy VII<br>35)RGR27<br>36)RGR28: GRT STR III (27)/ STR (28)<br>37)Rogue5<br>38)RGR29: Favored Enemy VIII<br>39)RGR30: GRT STR IV (29)/ Favored Enemy IX<br>40)Rogue6: STR (30)<br><br><br>AB: +43 (+45 vs favored enemies)<br><br>Naked AC: 20 (28 in mundane plate)<br><br>HPs: maximum of 496<br><br>Saves (vs spells):<br>Fort: 26 (30)<br>Refl: 19 (23)<br>Will: 21 (25)<br><br>Skills: 317 points, I recommend the following;<br>Discipline: 42<br>Tumble: 40<br>UMD: 41<br>Spellcraft: 18<br>Set Trap: 36<br>Hide: 43<br>Move: 43<br>Disable Trap: 36<br><br>He's got 7 FEs with 2d6+7 damage from Bane against them. He's also got +6 damage from EWS with his weapon of choice and +15 from STR (the 'Something Big' would be a 2-hander, in case anyone didn't catch that), so even against non-favored enemies, he still packs a punch. Add in Imp KD with 3d6 sneak attack, Set Trap, UMD, enough stealth from spells and skills even in full plate, and he ends up with a good bag of tricks from which to draw.<br><br>A couple of considerations: <br><br>1) I chose Expertise to help with his AC since he's got no shield. You could easily pop in Lightning Reflexes to aid your Reflex save (which wouldn't be a bad option since he gets Evasion from his Rogue levels). As with any 2-hander build, you should always have a sword and board option in your pack as well.<br><br>2) He's got a level 30 animal companion, which you can buff with his spells. However, he gets no spells that help with AC, so his companion's probably not going to last long in the battle. UMD could help a long way in that regard (Stoneskin, Imp Invis scrolls and the like). If you don't feel it's worth it, you could start with 12 DEX and 12 WIS and forget the higher level spells. I started the build off this way, but was convinced it would be better to have the higher spell slots.<br><br>3) You could start at level 1 as Rogue, which would net you 16 more skill points. This would allow you to max Disable and Set. But, do you really need them that high?<br><br>4) Another variant would be to take Bard instead of Rogue. You'd lose 24 skill points, Disable Trap as a class skill, 3d6 sneak attack, Evasion, and need to invest 13 points in Perform to get your level 6 Bard Song. (Effectively, you'd lose Disable Trap) You'd gain +1 AB and +2 damage from the Song, Spellcraft as a class skill (so you could max it for a further +4 saves vs spells), +1 on all saves from the Song, and slightly better Will save. You could also drop Hide and MS and invest in Taunt and another skill, possibly Concentration (you get a boost from the FE for your Taunt skill). I don't think it would be quite as effective, but still a viable alternative.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 07/14/05 22:35</span></i></p>

Bah, I made an error in th post. The build actually has <b>9</b> favored enemies, not 7. The last few levels should read:<br><br>33)RGR25: GRT STR II (26)/ Favored Enemy VI<br>34)RGR26: Favored Enemy VII<br>35)RGR27<br>36)RGR28: GRT STR III (27)/ STR (28)<br>37)Rogue5<br>38)RGR29: Favored Enemy VIII<br>39)RGR30: GRT STR IV (29)/ Favored Enemy IX<br>40)Rogue6: STR (30)<br><br>Too late to edit.

Crikey, this is starting to turn into my "Deathless Pariah"! I also forgot to point out the XP penalty between levels 17 and 21. It's only 4 levels, but it may turn some people off. If it's a big concern, then take your FTR level 2 pre-epic (before level 17) and shift your RGR levels accordingly. You'll lose an epic feat that way (most likely candidate to drop is Armor Skin), but you can level with no penalty.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

It's a large weapon and has all those modifications following it that a normal large weapon has, but it is not a 2-hander weapon like the greatsword. It is dual-wielded, not wielded 2-handed. Before anyone comments on this comment <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  you all know what I mean.<br><br>It has the boni to disarm that a large weapon has, and it can't be used by small races.
