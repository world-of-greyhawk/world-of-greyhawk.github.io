This build badly needs Monk, imo.  Going 1 level of monk will boost your AC by +3 <b>without</b> any WIS gear; also giving you an extra 3 APR (+2 kama APR, +1 flurry of blows).<br><br>Dropping Shadowdancer for Monk would free up two feats, for KD and something else, not to mention you could go for 6th monk and get IKD for free (and +1 Monk AC).

i love HiPs, i'd never give it away in any rogue build.<br>Of course 1-6 levels of monk would work well, too.
