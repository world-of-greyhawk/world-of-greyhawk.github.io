It's stout.  As billed, a very versatile weaponmaster.  Very good if not perfect level allocation for the build. And almost perfect pre-epic AB.  <br><br>Nice.

nice build , but why dont you go dex based if you dont take devcrit , with 13 rogue lvls its possible to get epic dodge and dex also increases your hide /ms and sneaking can be very effective with a build like that.

Uuum... Because my concept was for a STR-based build. Mithdradates and others have done quite a few dex-based ones so it's kind of redundant to make yet-another dexxer.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

if you want a dex version of this build, i might recommend looking up something like mithdrates' shin slasher.  if you use pulse caps search engine and use the values rogue, fighter and weapon master, raning from 1-30, you will find plenty of decent builds, many of which are dex based.  this one is the first with these numbers not to strive for ED and the like.<br><br>a nice char.  i have been thinking of something similar.  you beat me to it, so i will change my design a bit and post that, if i get around to it.<br><br>nicely done.  i lament only the lowish disable trap.  open locks and search are at about the right levels for good usefulness.  scimitar master rogue fighter.  nifty.<br><br>do you have any playing suggestions?  would it be best to get the stealth, or simply play as a fighter and use the rogue skills when the need occurs?<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Perception is strong and sight weak.

He's got high STR and with high STR, I really didn't think <i>slowly</i> (stealth = slow, unless you're a hasted monk) trying to stealth in full plate + tower shield was necessary so just charge in, whack away, heal when necessary like any other meleer and use rogue skills when necesarry but not in the heat of battle. But that's just me. If you really want to use that 7d6 sneak attack, and scout ahead, take ESFs in Hide and MS, dropping two Great STR and decide which skills you want to chop to jack up Hide and MS. Also consider getting Crippling Stike if you plan on doing this.<br><br>16 Disable Traps gets you 36 with Take 20 which is enough to disable everything non-epic, but don't go using it in combat. If you wanted more, shift some points from say, open locks.<br><br>I guess this could be considered a build for those who like killing things the easy and direct way (sometimes I feel lazy) yet also have options to do things other ways if necessary or more convenient.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

Meh - I'm just used to having a lot of my KDs miss (probably because I'm not as skilled at playing yet - I find it hard to tell when a round ends) so when I play stealthers, it's sneak up and KD, land some sneaks, then KD again when the victim gets up - but it's a WM so it's far easier to land hits. I guess, then, it'd probably be a better idea to take Imp. Evasion and Crippling Strike and skip Slippery Mind, especially if you can get immunity to mind-affecting spells.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

It is fairly easy to know when a round is about to start. You could count the flurries or the attacks on the flurries:<br><br>1 attack per round. 1attack, wait, wait<br>- Easy enough.<br><br>2 attacks per round: 1 attack, 1 attack, idle.<br>- When you see your character is "waiting" it means you are about to begin a new attack phase.<br><br>3 attacks per round: 1 attack, 1 attack, 1 attack.<br>- **<br><br>4 attacks per round: 2attacks, 1 attack, 1 attack.<br>- Wait until the second flurry with a single attack, it is the end of the round.<br><br>5 attacks per round: 2Attacks, 2Attacks, 1 attack.<br>- The last flurry is the one with a single attack.<br><br>6 attacks per round: 2Attacks, 2Attacks, 2Attacks.<br>- **<br><br>7 Attacks per round: 3Attacks, 2Attacks, 2Attacks.<br>- Same than with 4 attacks, wait for your second 2-hit flurry, that's the last flurry on the round.<br><br>8 Attacks per round: 3Attacks, 3Attacks, 2Attacks.<br>- Same than with 5. Wait for your 2-attack flurry. That was the last in the round.<br><br>** When you have 3 or 6 (or 9) attacks per round you can watch your enemy attack progression, the round starts at the same time for both you and your enemy, so you can watch him to keep the timing.<br><br>Tips:<br><br>- If hasted your first and your last attack per round are the best ones for throwing a KD.<br><br>- I can't tell you for sure how it is when dualwielding, I should take a look. But I think that the best attacks are your first, second and last each round.<br><br>- Timing is really good for spellcasting too. If you are playing a spellsword and you "cast" your spells (or use items such as potions) while you are throwing your second flurry (Sometimes the third, depending on haste) you have to wait less to cast/use losing less attacks per round and being flat-footed for less time, timing is a lifesaver in battle with spellswords.<br><br>*Edit: Checked spelling and format*<br>_________________<br>HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh.

Nice build, I would have just started dwarf for either 18 CON (+40 HP), either 16 CON, 17 STR, 13 DEX (and 14 INT) whith a final 32 STR (you start with 1 more STR and free up the Dex increase to qualify for dodge). <br>Starting with 18 CON you could choose to go for 26 STR, 22 CON final and fit in EDR III.<br>Just some ideas,<br>cheers

I did start this build as a Dwarf but you must remember that they don't get 2 feats at creation and it means a net loss of one feat, probably Toughness, leaving the HPs the same while losing skillpoints. It also means getting Blind Fight later or Weapon Spec. later.<br><br>I never thought of adding EDR but probably aren't enough feats to fit it in comfortably.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.
