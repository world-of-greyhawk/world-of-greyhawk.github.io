all around skilled, incredibly stealthy, hard to hit and gets a second chance at virtually everything shadowdancer.

This combined with epic dodge makes it harder to kill then the low ammount of hit points would first make you guess, and when death is imminent it can run away, hide in plain sight, and drink potions to heal/buff up as necessary, returning to sneak attack again. shadow evade is 16/+6, and the shadow is a 24th level fighter, with whirlwind attack as well.<br><br>weaknesses - ok, this character is TERRIBLE against undead, as are most rogue builds. it tends to not get hit often, but deals very little damage (due to the low strength), and the shadow is no help until 25th or so level, after which he gains a lot of power very quickly. Oh, and the reason he needs a buckler, a short sword and monk armor is that besides that, too many pebbles in his pocket slow him down. (maximum weight - 100 lbs) get a strong pack mule... I mean cohort. then tell them to wait at the entrance of the dungeon, because this character actually does worse when he has help.<br><br>Variants : you can cut back on some of the skills you use less (appraise and persuade come to mind) and switch them for set trap and craft trap. traps and hiding are really nice, especially if you replace opportunist for skill mastery, hide in plain sight and set traps while people are fighting to catch multiple opponents in a deadly trap.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/10/07 14:35</span></i></p>
