This build was inspired by Tengudor's Red Mage build.  I really liked the idea of an Arcane and Divine caster, but I wanted something a little more balanced.  This build only gets 6th lvl Divine spells, but it gets decent HP and AB, while still managing to get 9th lvl arcane spells, Dev. Crit., Epic Warding, and Epic Weapon Spec.<br><br>Cleric 11/Fighter 8/Wizard 21<br>(pre-epic Cleric 11/Fighter 5/Wizard 4)<br><br>Race: Dwarf<br><br>Domains: Stength and Healing<br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting:<br><br>Str 14 <br>Dex 8<br>Con 16<br>Int 16<br>Wis 15<br>Cha 6<br><br>Ending:<br><br>Str 25<br>Dex 8<br>Con 16<br>Int 19<br>Wis 16<br>Cha 6<br><br>1 point into Wis, 9 points into Str<br><br>Feats<br><br>Pre-epic:<br><br>1 Power Attack <br>3 Cleave<br>6 Still Spell<br>9 Toughness* <br>12 Extend Spell* <br>15 Great Cleave <br>18 Empower Spell* <br><br>Note: Feats with an * are optional, and may be replaced by whatever you like.  <br><br>Fighter: WF: Scimitar, Imp.

This character is tough to  kill because of his high HP, along with Epic Warding and the ability to heal himself to full health with a single spell.  Flame Weapon + Darkfire add quite a bit to his damage, and the various Cleric buffs (Prayer, Bless, Aid, Divine Favor, etc.), add a significant amount as well.  Divine Power adds a nice bit to AB, and if that's not enough, you've always got True Strike for a whopping +20 bonus.

Crit. <br><br>I had to change the levels around a little, but that should work, on the condition that you can take Epic Weapon Spec on a Wizard level.  I am assuming that you can, because it was listed as a general feat in the manual.  That said, if the manual is wrong and you can't take Epic Weapon Spec on a Wizard level, just take another Great Str feat instead.  You will end up losing 3 points of damage, but you gain 1 point of AB in return, so it's not a bad trade-off.  Sorry about the mistake; I've been playing around with this build so much trying to optimize it that I guess I missed a couple things.  I'll make sure to include the build order from now on.

I doubt if you can take epic weapon spec on wizard level. But still, this character is very good - less versatile then Red Mage, but better in combat. At least that's what I see from the ordinary stats - mind posting his stats when buffed up? It's really important for characters who rely on buffs.

Probably for the best; its suprising just how many builds I've made that were seemed okay on paper but once you go through the levels, some subtle thing messes it up. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Normal kids play rock-paper-scissors.<br>Shifter kids play IronGolem-RustMonster-MindFlayer. . .
