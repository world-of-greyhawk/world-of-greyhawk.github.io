Hi Anyone i'm really struggling <br><br>I want to make a Ranger / WM / Assassin preferable an ELF. as the Server i PvM on gives Assassins a HiPS skin at LvL 10 <br><br>I need to get the Ranger to Lvl 9 at least as I'm wanting to use 2 Shortswords and its improve two weapons as a freebie at that level. So need a High Dex but would also like to get Str to 23 for Overwhelming Crit for the Blades..<br><br>Last thing the server i use we have to build 5 levels per change of class so by choosing the 3rd class i already HAVE to have 5 in the other 2. I tried 14 builds so far and cant get it beg beg beg grovel HELP !!!!!!

If you follow that build you should be able to take WM levels as early as lvl 16.  If you want to max you AB you shouldn't take any Assassin levels until Epic (lvls 21+).  <br><br>The only comment that I have is that if you want to make this build better I would probably go with Fighter rather than Ranger.  Why?  Well, at lvl 9 a Ranger gets the two-weapon Fighting feats "for free", which is equal to 3 feats, even if you do have to wear light armor (or no armor) to make them work.  However, by level 8 the Fighter would have already gotten you 5 feats.  <br><br>By Fighter level 20 you would have gotten 11 bonus feats, which really ain't bad at all.  Not only that, but if you want the Ranger spells you need 14 Wis, whereas a Fighter could do perfectly well with an 8 in Wisdom.  <br><br>The Ranger allows you to get Bane of Enemies, which is a decent enough ability that gives you 2-12 damage and +2 AB vs. your Favored Enemies, in addition to your regular +5 damage from Favored Enemy.  A Fighter would give you Epic Weapon Spec, which only gives you +6 to damage, but it works against every creature that you attack with your chosen weapon.

Hmmm good point about the Fighter lvls. Theres a good case for going that way. Would there be a XP penalty doing fight though ?

As long as fighter is your only core class, you shouldn't have any XP penalties.<br>Fighter will net you a lot of feats. The problem with fighter is the lower number of skill points, and the fact that you have to cross-class hide and move silently to qualify for assassin. But with a high intelligence it should be possible.<br><br>In my opinion, if you want to take ranger you should go "all the way" and get as many favoured enemies and as high bonus against them as possible.<br><br>Or if skills are important in your build, the ranger has more skillpoints and a better skill selection than the fighter.<br><br>But if you only want a "minor or medium" fighter type class in your build, fighter gives you a lot with it's bonus feats and weapon specialization. The bonus feats will let you qualify early for weaponmaster.
