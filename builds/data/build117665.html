Ok this is my latest character I've been playing and it's been tons of fun.<br><br>Pros:<br>-hardest-to-hit character I've ever seen (50% concealment, epic dodge, and 70+ AC with good equipment)<br>-with the 2-weapon fighting feats and great cleave you're certainly not all defense as you can carve your way through a battlefield with some of the best<br>-Plenty of rouge levels giving you the ability to take care of traps/locks/stealth and everything rouges are famous for<br>-You can hide in plain sight and have a killer sneak attack which can fell the most hardy melee opponents<br><br>Cons:<br>-low Constitution means you may die often in the earlier levels<br>-magic directed directly at you can cause some problems, (area affect spells usually go with reflex saves so you will take no damage from these with improved evasion)<br><br><br>Starting stats<br>Str 13<br>Dex 18<br>Con 11<br>Int 14<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 12<br><br><br>Lvl 1:Rouge-Weapon Finesse<br>Lvl 2:Rouge-<br>Lvl 3:Rouge-Dodge<br>Lvl 4:Rouge-Stat increase:Dex<br>Lvl 5:Rouge-<br>Lvl 6:Rouge-Mobility<br>Lvl 7:Rouge-(make sure you have 10 hide, 8 move silently, and 5 tumble when you level 7)<br>Lvl 8:Shadow Dancer-Stat increase:Dex<br>Lvl 9:Fighter-Ambidexterity/2-weapon fighting<br>Lvl 10:Fighter-Power Attack<br>Lvl 11:Fighter-<br>Lvl 12:Fighter-Cleave/Great Cleave-Stat Increase:Dex<br>Lvl 13:Rouge-<br>Lvl 14:Rouge-<br>Lvl 15:Rouge-Improved 2-weapon fighting/Improved Evasion<br>Lvl 16:Rouge-Stat Increase:Dex<br>Lvl 17:Rouge-<br>Lvl 18:Rouge-Iron Will<br>Lvl 19:Rouge-<br>Lvl 20:Rouge-Stat Increase:Dex<br>Lvl 21:Fighter-Great Dexterity I<br>Lvl 22:Fighter-Armor Skin<br>Lvl 23:Rouge-Slippery Mind<br>Lvl 24:Rouge-Great Dexterity II-Stat Increase:Dex<br>Lvl 25:Rouge-<br>Lvl 26:Rouge-Epic Dodge<br>Lvl 27:Rouge-Great Dexterity III<br>Lvl 28:Rouge-Stat Increase:Dex<br>Lvl 29:Rouge-<br>Lvl 30:Rouge-Great Dexterity IV<br>Lvl 31:Rouge-Skill Mastery<br>Lvl 32:Rouge-Stat Increase:Dex<br>Lvl 33:Rouge-Self Concealment I<br>Lvl 34:Rouge-<br>Lvl 35:Rouge-Self Concealment II<br>Lvl 36:Rouge-Self Concealment III-Stat Increase:Con<br>Lvl 37:Rouge-<br>Lvl 38:Rouge-<br>Lvl 39:Rouge-Self Concealment IV/Self Concealment V<br>Lvl 40:Shadow Dancer-Stat Increase:Str<br><br>Final Stats:<br>Str 14<br>Dex 30<br>Con 12<br>Int 14<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 12<br><br>You end up Rouge 32/Fighter 6/Shadow Dancer 2<br><br>The biggest thing you have to figure out is where you want to put all your skill points. Keep in mind you must have 30 tumble for Epic Dodge, and 30 hide and tumble for self concealment.<br>I would recommend getting tumble up to 40 (to give you +8 AC giving you 30 AC wearing nothing at all).<br>Set Trap, Disable Trap, and Open Lock all get the +10 bonus from your dexterity so they don't need to be more than 25 or so (you'll be rolling 55 on them even in battle because of skill mastery). The intelligence based skills, as well as listen and spot could use a boost though.<br>Use Magical Device is always nice, especially since you will want to wear monk robes, because wearing any type of armor will kill your dexterity bonus.<br>Parry can be maxxed out with no real detrement to the main rouge skills if you that's your cup o' tea.<br><br>Basically, this is a character that will only be hit on an opponent's critical hits (using equpiment I obtained in completing HotU my character had an AC of 71, meaning you need an attack bonus of +52 to hit me on a non-critical hit), but 50% of those will miss because of the concealment and the first one that DOES hit each round will be evaded because of epic dodge. I do recommend a good cloak of fortification (+7ish at least) or some magical item that will boost your will saves, as that can be your downfall.<br><br>All in all, a beautiful melee defense character as well as a very skilled rouge that can be used in dungeon crawls<br><br><br>There are lots of ways you can alter the character slightly to suit your tastes, enjoy<br>_________________<br>"I've got to follow them.

(granted they didn't hit my ac, so that may be it) If that's the case though, the feat is fairly useless. with concealment 50% you wouldn't need it because there's only a 50% chance that the first hit will hit you, even if they can hit your ac.<br>_________________<br>Save yourself some arm strain.
