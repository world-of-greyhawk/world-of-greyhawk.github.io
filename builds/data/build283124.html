<i>Defending against Evil and Adventuring PvM (1-40) and PvP </i><br><br><br><b>SHADOW SWORD (Paladin Order, Arvoreen’s Marchers: Halfling Defender)<br>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar</b><br><br><br><i>Concept – Paladin-Rogue of Arvoreen (Halfling Defenders): The Art of Defense</i><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; <br>The Paladins of Arvoreen are a Halfling Order in Tethyr, known officially as the “Arvoreen Marchers” but also as Halfling Defenders, officially recognized by the Crown; a small but highly regarded order, Arvoreen’s Marchers are respected by humans and halflings alike. <br><br>Arvoreen is the Halfling God of War, whose portfolio includes Defense (Protection), Good, Duty (Law), and vigilance; his is a “Power of stern defense and aggressive watchfulness, who is always preparing for incursions into (H)alfling lands and making ready to repulse hostile creatures at the first sign of trouble.”  His primary worshippers are Halfling soldiers and warriors including battle clerics and paladin-rogues, who specialize in all matters of defense.<br><br>Arvoreen's dogma is best captured by the phrase: “The Best Offense is a Strong Defense,” and is as follows: <br><br>“Keep the community's burrows secure, and always be prepared for threats and attacks. Prepare an active defense, drill continuously, and leave nothing to chance. Put down danger before it even rears its head. Seek out allies, no matter how unorthodox. Those who give aid against a mutual foe are friends to be rewarded and trusted. Stealing from other halflings and allies is never acceptable, but thieving is not necessarily dishonorable, as long as it is employed against enemies to better the odds in combat later.” <br><br>The Arvoreen Marchers adhere to this dogma in a manner befitting the Code of Heironeous (see, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deities_of_Dungeons_&amp;_Dragons" target="_blank">Click Here</a> (“Paladin Code”), being also another paladin order with whose deity Arvoreen is closely allied such that, even although Arvoreen’s Marchers are a bit unorthodox as compared to most, the two paladin orders share a common bond. Accordingly, Arvoreen's Defenders are protectors of halfling communities, “constructing defensive barriers, signaling systems, beacons, and traps, and reviewing defenses already in place . . . (Whereas m)any clerics organize the local militia, procure weapons for volunteers, and train every able-bodied halfling in the use of weapons and other defense strategies or at least in how to best seek safety, … Arvoreen's Marshals regularly adventure to gain magical weapons and defensive items of all kinds.” <br><br>Arvoreen is an intermediate deity but a major Power in the Halfling Universe, being a child of (and subservient only to) Yondalla, the “Blessed One.” Yondalla is a major deity throughout all of Faerun for she is the Creator of the Halfling race and thus the Matriarch, Provider, and Ultimate Protector of all Halflings and their good-aligned/good-natured allies, being herself aligned closely with Corellon, Moradin, Tyr, Torm, Helm and Chanteau. Like Yondalla, Arvoreen smiles on followers who aid and protect those in need. He is likewise a LG deity, his favored weapon being “Aegisheart” (shortsword) and his symbol that of two crossed shortswords.  <br><br>Source: This information is excerpted and adapted from: <a href="http://nwn2.wikia.com/wiki/Arvoreen" target="_blank">http://nwn2.wikia.com/wiki/Arvoreen</a><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->This build and its companion, the Shadow Shield are designed with Arvoreen’s philosophy in mind – namely, that the best offense is a strong defense. Being Halfling Paladins of the same Order, the Shadow Shield and Shadow Sword are quite similar; however, whereas the Shield comprises Paladin/SD/Rogue (SC5-ED/Holy Sword-Wielding Paladin with HiPs), this build comprises Paladin/CoT/Rogue (SC5-ED/Holy Sword-Wielding Paladin with ITWF) who enjoys more feats, skillpoints and the potential for dishing higher damage as a dual-wielder in lieu of HiPs (which damage, as with all dex-based builds, you’ll further enhance by putting your UMD to good use).<br><br>While there are many Paladin/CoT/Rogue combinations in the guild, this build is highly unique: along with his/her companion, s/he is the first SC5-ED/Holy Sword-Wielding Paladin to debut here at the ECB, according to the Pulse. <br><br>To see his/her companion, Shadow Shield,  <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "283123", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>   .

It looks really good by the time you get to the end, but it takes too long to mature.  There's hardly any damage output pre-epic, and Epic Dodge coming at Level 30 in spite of starting with a Dex20 seems counterintuitive.  And that's the problem with any build that tries to do too much-- they just take a really long time to develop.  <br><br>I would go Rogue12/Paladin2/CoT6 at least to be a decent Rogue in pre-epic and to give you some kind of offensive spark.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Oh, the maturity rate of dexers, I do hear you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">       <br><br>That said, I prefer the +2 hard AB over the entire life of the build here, rather than some earlier sneak; yeah, he’s got i.e. UMD/darkness and pally buffs to cover, this is true, but those pally buffs (sans holy sword etc. of course) are vulnerable. Recent events ie mord’s has made me re-think the whole ‘buffing’ thing all-around, and especially when it comes to dexers w. the impr.invis. scrolls (mords=useless); besides, dexers are (let’s face it) umd and/or equip’t hogs, they just are, but this one’s not as dependent as most, thanks to his/her sneak 10d6 x’s 6 apr (or, 60d6 sneak, make that 60d7 hasted, plus the buffs of course, with the option for traps if you want more --- that said, you need AB to deliver damage (i.e., if no hit, then no damage), hence Naked 44 (50 dex.cap, +5 holy sword only (or +5 weapon), add +6 taunt (which with SC5 you can pretty much do as you want, no worries since w. it, ED and uncanny, along w. a very nice AC, you’re not exactly getting hit but the one who’s doing the hitting, and it’s pretty darn cool)    <br><br>Besides, more AB = more hits and more hits in turn = more overall damage, and with the planned rogue dumps, i.e., UMD together with the pally buffs and of course weaponry, he’s playable enough pre-ep … also, can start off ranged if want (i.e., full BAB/warrior-pally table, far better than a rogue’s, with Dex 20 and Halfling race bonus to ranged (think of it as a WF for free!) Buffs and UMD/weaponry for more, plus, works really nice later on vis-à-vis those mestil’s animals, I might add <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     <br><br>As to late maturity, well, that’s what happens when you're planning/aiming lvl 40 as here, and here's why: <br>a)	AB to deliver, and ITWF to deliver that much more – enhance w. your own buffs, along w. weaponry and/or UMD (again, as with all dexers) <br>b)	ED. At level 30 it’s not late; in fact, at 400+ HPs, doesn’t *need* ED (then again, couldn’t exactly call him/her a bastion of defense in the name of Arvoreen w.o it, now could we? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">        That said, it’s there, and it works, and w.o giving up any AB etc. for it.<br>c)	SC5 – undeniably the best protection in the game; yes, it’s expensive, but it’s permanent and cannot be avoided or taken away. <br><br>Hence, excellence in terms of defense/survivability, and without giving up AB or damage for it – wasn’t easy to do, I must say, and at the same time, keep playability in mind (i.e., reason why there’s any rogue pre-ep at all, otherwise, heh, you know me: I would have gone straight 15 pally/5 Cot pre-ep and wound up with +1 BAB/AB (nat.AB 45), but with fewer skills and -1 refl., not to mention zero pre-ep access umd/stealth/tumble, wouldn’t if had gone that route been very playable, whereas this variant is (and why I posted it, and really, lvl 40 BAB 29, AB 44 with level 1-40 playable skill dumps (i.e., planned pre-epic topping of tumble (AC), umd, stealth, etc) and more of ‘em (as in, taunt or traps, etc.), +1 refl., w. ITWF, sneak 60d6 (60d7 hasted), ED, SC5, Uncanny, etc., now,  that’s playable, and in my books works great lvl 40, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">       <br><br>I understand your concern about playability btw, as in, earlier sneak pre-ep would make it easier to level in a lowish magic environs, this is true, but then, going 12 rogue pre-ep would cost you -2 BAB/AB (which needs to be mentioned, and at lvl 40, just wouldn’t do); besides, this build isn’t designed for low-magic/no-magic worlds (no dexer is really and buffs in light of mord’s aren’t a substitute for weaponry and/or UMD (in which case, at every level and not just lvl 40 you’ll be really happy to have hard AB in tact, with SC5 to cast and recast at your leisure for more damage, or potion, or what have you, which SC5 alone allows you to do since it’s permanent and secure, and rather awesome really, especially when combined as here with HPs, ED and uncanny; yes, SC5’s expensive, but on a dex build, in light of mord’s, I really do believe it’s worth it … and when you also have that wondrous Holy Sword <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">        (then, while I like my taunt (note: ultravision + darkness recipe, then taunt, then go in, KD and sneak, works wonders, along with the other rogue tricks of course), but for more damage pre-ep if you want, by all means, go the traps route instead of taunt; with dex.cap, prayer and a simple +3 skilling item, heh, you’re setting EPIC Traps and that be some serious damage alright, among other neat rogue twix of course (that, the traps route, would indeed seriously enhance playability when combined w. the UMD along the way pre-ep, too, and appreciate your comment/keeping an eye out for same, GD always good to see ya).<br><br>Sneak/Cast/Holy Sword-Dispel Magic ON! ~ Tyr<br>_________________<br>"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good [people] to do nothing" -- Edmund Burke, Philosopher and Politician (1729-1797)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 09/17/07 19:47</span></i></p>

Oh, if this is for a high magic world, I can see your point.  But then, in a high magic world where AC outpaces AB by 5 to 1, is a 44 AB even high enough?  Personally, I'd take the 6d6 sneak pre-epic over -2AB and 2d6 sneak.  You have to have some means of piercing natural DR and magical DR.  You see, if you are relying on UMD to save your hide and squeak at your pre-epic existance, why not UMD the Holy Sword spell instead of investing 15 levels of Paladin into a Dex-based character?  <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 09/17/07 19:25 (GMT) -- TyrTemplar<br><br> heh, you’re setting EPIC Traps and that be some serious damage alright, among other neat rogue twix</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Also, with a 7 in Disable Traps and a 1 Search, where is he finding these Epic Traps?

Epic Warding is not the only thing that can block it.  There are some other ways to get good DR, and that's to include from items that you might find in that same PW where Epic Traps are lying about, or from Dragon Shape which is 40/+6 DR. or Epic Gargoyle Form which has 25/+7, and so on.  Also, for the Holy Sword's property to actually work, it has to be able to do some type of damage.... and this is where my brain gets fuzzy, but iirc, I think the HS is picky about what it considers damge done.  I don't seem to recall elemental damge from the sword as counting for triggering, or firing if you will, the HS property.  But it's been a long while, and something like that would be worth testing.<br><br>And the other thing about being Dispelled....  that only counts for default environments.  Several worlds I've played on have found ways to make Mord's (and the rest of the dispel line) actually dispell temporary effects on weapons and armor.  <br><br>Eh, I know nothing about high magic PvP worlds, so I'll keep my mouth shut and stick with what I know.

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      <br> <br>Sneaking up on a dragon, GD? well, not the most effective dragon-slaying technique, but you definitely be one gutsy dwarf, I'll give ya that! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">       <br><br>Seriously, shifter/druid types aren't a concerrn in higher magic settings (gargoyle's cool, great damage soakers, but that soak (same for drakes) only good vs. physical damage, nothing to help vs. magic, divine, sonic, cold, fire, etc., and breach it also with sneak; true for drakes also (though they be immune to sneak and have varying elemental resistances depending on color - take Red for e.g., immune to fire 100%, but vulnerable to cold 50%, so stock up on that cold -- DR don't help them against that, nor anything else non-physical (barring their own particular resistance, once again, know your colors); then, when it comes to dispel, don't need no holy sword if they've less than 25 druid -- regular dispelling works just fine <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">       <br><br>Excellent lead in though, must say, as to what it takes in a higher magic world, which be about versatily in terms of covering off the various damage types since, to the extent such settings permit all sorts of wondrous damage enhancements and umd etc., you can also expect all sorts of different resistance granting gear, in which case, versatility is key (since, unlike dragons, your foes don't come in color-adverts as to what works and what won't, so be sure, and with not just one but two daggers, with pally buffs and umd for more (along w. AC/uncanny/ED/SC5 let's you recast if dispelled after all) you got it covered (covering off damage types once again being key).<br><br>A fact recently echoed by Tatooed Monk in responding to a player's question as to whether ws/ews would be a waste of 2 feats on a fighter in a high magic world where his scimmy could be enhanced by 2d6 sonic, 2d6 lightning, 2d6 acid, 2d6 magic, 2d6 extra slashing, 2d6 cold, 2d6 fire and 2d6 massive crits, about which TM had the following to say:  <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/23/07 19:54 (GMT) -- Tattoed Monk<br>Depends. Are there items that grant DR 15/sonic, lightning, acid, etc.? Because that will largely neutralize most of the bonus damage from your weapon. If not, then EWS is a waste - 6 more points won't matter. If so, then it's not a waste - the extra 6 base damage points may be the only ones that get through, the rest will get eaten up by the various DR types. <br><br>For example, even a simple Ring of Elemental Resistance will give DR 15 vs. fire, cold, lightning, and acid. That takes care of 4 of your 2d6 bonuses right there. If there are unusual items that also resist sonic and magic (the only 2 on your list that are generally hard to find), then I would say EWS may be a good investment. If there are items with high DR vs. slashing, piercing, etc., then you may also want to carry a few different types of weapons (i.e. focus on scim, but carry a warhammer and a rapier just in case....).<br><br>TM</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->It is a statement with which I agree, i.e., versatily in terms of damage types is key. While generally speaking, the higher the magic the more obsolete are buffs like GMW, stuff like div.favor (magic), clang (sonic) remain valuable, for the same reasons as ws/ews in the above scenario (foes don't come in colors afterall, and who knows, maybe it's the magic or sonic which will breach), hence important to keep an eye also on your scroll case, and enjoy your holy sword, too (works on any weapon, as powerful in a high magic settings as it is in lower magic one, if not even more so); might also consider carrying a few different types of weapons (i.e., your focus is dual-daggers, onto each one you will apply different on-hit properties, one of which will likely be holy sword (avenger), the other as you want, with the ability to dual-wield ensuring you’re covering off all the various damage types. Just in case, carry a sickle (slashing weapon) and mace (bludgeoning). <br><br><br><i>Holy Sword</i><br>As to how the HS works, you’re bang on, GD: for dispel on-hit to trigger, not automatic ‘on-hit’ as the description suggests but, rather, fires on damage; in the 40/+6 dragon e.g., for argument’s sake, let’s say we do 73 damage (18 physical, 3 sonic, 6 divine, 13 fire, 16 cold, 5 magic, 12 acid), and no sneak (drakes are immune to sneak), all very nice and all, only DR absorbed 18 of it, such that 45 of that 73 went through – however, because the DR absorbed all the physical damage dealt, holy sword won’t trigger; totally different story of course the instant you have a +6 weapon though, so long as do a point of phys (which, with no DR woes we of course would do), then HS fires just fine, and can be cast onto any melee weapon such that it really is quite powerful, in any magic setting.<br><br><i>Different Schticks for Different Folks – High Magic Worlds are About Customization:</i><br>You’re right that a lot of interesting things go on in higher magic places, GD, and all the more reason of course for ensuring that what it is you want is in fact innate to you (as in, SC5 – your self-conceal which you own, not some dispellable/purgeable/mordable scroll or buff, nor is it from some ‘on item’ prop, like a cloak, which in some places can be dispelled/morded/removed, too.  Similarly, as a mid-paladin, you own the right to wield holy sword (spell or perma-avenger/weapon), which can’t be denied you either. No different in this way from lower magic worlds in this sense then, and build accordingly; although higher magic places tend to be more about player customization and personal choice -- i.e., if you want a holy avenger dagger or great sword as opposed to a long sword, then you can have one made to order (note: in lower magic worlds, avengers tend to but not always come in the form of a long sword, but in higher magic worlds you aren’t so limited). At the same time, many worlds tend to balance this off by enforcing item/class/restrictions – i.e., while anyone perhaps can craft an avenger out of any melee weapon they want, won’t do them any good if their character doesn’t have at least 10+ paladin in it to the extent that the avenger won’t fire for non-paladins. <br><br>This ain’t the default rule, but is enforced in many places, and especially in high magic settings (similar restrictions I’ve also seen placed on vorpal weapons, mainly rogue-combos (in NwN2, there’s an entire drow world/faction comprised of wizard-rogues types based around vorpal weaponry). For those who aren’t familiar with vorpal, it’s pnp, essentially an On-Hit property which forces a fort save vs. insta-death on a natural 20; where I’ve seen them in NwN, it’s more akin to a dev.crit, so far as it forces said save vs. insta-death on a regular crit, with the DC to save against being set by the world where the vorpal weapon exists (was around DC 50 or 55 as I recall, and don’t remember whether or not immunity to crit (dev.crit) would save you from vorpal (does in pnp, but again, all of this is very much world-specific dependent, as is the decision as to whether or not such a weapon should even exist -- but not to worry, Sword's saves(assuming cha.gear, saves-cap, and resp. stat boost: Fort 56 / Will 50 / Refl. 64 (impr.evasion), with your immunities, ED and SC5 in tact, i.e., can't hit much less crit what can't hit (but that divine grace boni to saves is nice, too). <br><br><i>Balancing - Limits and Wonders of Magic</i><br>Of course, another balancing thing (in addition to class and item restrictions) in many worlds where players are free to add damage enhancements and on-hit properties of their own choosing is to limit the number of on-hit properties to one, and also the number of different damages permitted on any given weapon (so no +6 Holy Avenger Vorpal Daggers, then again, you’ve ITWF so get two weapons, right? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">        <br><br>OK, all fun aside, it really does depend, GD, as lots of things are possible in higher magic settings (where it’s more about player customization and creativity in crafting and, in many cases, going back to implement/adjust for balancing – reason why we always must keep in mind the default rules on our end, and reason also why players must keep this in mind and (always) feel free to adjust.<br><br>(thanks, GD -- as always, a great discussion ~ Tyr <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good [people] to do nothing" -- Edmund Burke, Philosopher and Politician (1729-1797)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 09/19/07 08:18</span></i></p>
