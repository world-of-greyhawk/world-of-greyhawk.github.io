Since it's an RP server, whoring up the stats and min/maxing is kind of frowned upon by the many DMs. But of course, this doesnt mean that they can suck <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Now, i'd like to create 2 new characters, and play with them. The max lvl is 30, and there are plenty of magical items.<br><br>One of them, an indian/native. I guess class barbarian would be most suitable for this. I'd like this one to be a super warrior, and perhaps some kind of connection with the land/earth, because of his history and roots.<br><br>The 2nd one, I want to be an arcane archer, a true scout. I've never ever played an archer, so i dont even know if shortbow, long or composite is the way to go <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> .  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif"> <br><br>Anyway... I'd appreciate any pointers, and even better, a little character sheet with lvl progression and all. Those are mighty useful!<br>Oh, one more ting... What voice-set would be most appropiate for each? And what alignement? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">
