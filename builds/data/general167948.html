I was playing around with different characters in the novice to epic chracter module and whenever I tested my characters the one opponent that could always hit me no matter how high my ac was was the level 40 rogue. He also seemed to sneak attack me even when I was engaged in melee against him which I find strange. I know you lose dex bonus when flatfooted but do you also lose dodge bonus from say monk boots? My character would also from time to time stop attacking and therefore get sneaked again. Any ideas why that happens?<br>Final question, what does the cannot be flanked that the dwarven defender has, mean? I thought it meant he couldn't be sneaked but obviously not. How about uncanny dodge?

No circle kick. I think perhaps it has something to do with concealment or imp invis, either way it is too powerful I think cause I am getting sneaked so bad.<br>To counter it I made a pretty cool character, a druid5shifter10rogue25. For some reason I was able to choose undead shape at shifter level 10 and I could pick epic dodge without having dodge but i only got to SC IV, maybe it is possible to get SC V aswell. Anyway when shifted to the risen lord this was a good fighter who didnt have to worry about sneak attacks, too bad a scythe isnt finessable hehe.
