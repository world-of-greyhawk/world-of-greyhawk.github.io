This build is based in no small part on Zelle's Nature's Faces build, but features a different progression based on different priorities. Thanks Zelle for your excellent work. Also thanks to Douglas Crews for his Shifter FAQ. The focus of this build is to maximize playability from 1-40 without compromising level 40 power.<br><br>Differences from Zelle's Build.<br>1) Earlier access to Epic Shapes which makes the game much easier. This also does not come at a cost of less power later on.<br> Undead Shape at level 24 vs level 33<br> Outsider Shape at level 27 vs level 33<br> Construct Shape at level 31 vs level 38<br> Dragon Shape at level 36 vs level 39<br>2) 1 Extra Epic Feat (Armor Skin) since we started with 18 Wisdom instead of 17 and could skip Great Wisdom IV. This comes at a cost of 10 ST instead of 13, but since none of our feats requires 13 ST, it doesn't matter.<br>3) No Discipline Skill. With most shapes having fairly high AC, discipline is probably superfluous.<br><br>Race Human<br>Alignment Lawful Neutral <br><br>Starting(Ending)<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 10<br>Con 12<br>Wis 18 (31)<br>Int 14<br>Cha 8<br><br>Skill points 301<br>HP 400<br>AC 30 naked<br>AB +25/+20/+15<br>Saves<br>Fort +25<br>Reflex +20<br>Will +30<br><br>*Feats that can be changed without altering the integrity of the build.

Some Additional Comments.<br><br>I tried to come up with a way to not end up with 31 Wis. But There aren't any good alternatives if you want Dragon shape earlier. Also 31 Wis and +11 from Owl's Wisdom, gets you 42 which is pretty nice.

Boots doesn't transfer into forms, at least not in some forms like Dragonshape, but with the Dragon Stength, your discipline gets a good boost, if you have maxed it before. Dragons aren't immune to KD, and without uncanny dodge a Dragon looses huge amount of AC on his back. Even with uncanny he looses 20 AC, so GET DISCIPLINE.

You haven't posted if it's PvM or PvP or if it's playable 1-40 or anything like that. But without discipline it quickly looses PvP ability. One just need to spam KD's until he rolls a 20, and you are down for sure. Then wave goodbye to all your dodge and DEX ac, which will be more than 30 points of AC. Then the hits and crits will hit you like a wave of doom, 100 hitpoints quickly becomes none.<br><br>If it is PvM only, then your point is good.

If Discipline is your thing, you might want to move the Monk level to level 40 so as to maximize the skill dump into discipline. This build does not suffer from lack of skill points, so discipline could easily be accomodated.
