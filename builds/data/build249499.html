DIVINE ARCHER<br>By Deborah Tyr<br><br>Concept: This is an epic cleric, a follower of Loki "the Trickster" and also Thor (Thunder). Casting's not the focus on this one per se (ie., no spell foci but with high wisdom, accesses 9th level spells); instead, the purpose here was to create an archer with synergies between cleric and arcane archer for AB/damage abilities &amp; stealth, while maintaining cleric spell access. In addition, Archer can buff up for melee combat, adding versatility &amp; fun. <br><br>I would like to thank a number of people for generously commenting on another character in the Norse series, with special thanks out to: Grim, Samphus, and Avado, and also Thax, Mith, Kail and absolutely everyone else who took the time to comment. I hope everyone enjoys Divine Archer, and look forward to your thoughts ~ Tyr <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">         <br><br>DIVINE ARCHER (the "Trickster") -- Overview<br>Wizard (1), Cleric(26), Arcane Archer(13)<br><br>Race: Elf (Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Keen Sense, Low-light Vision, Skill Affinity: Listen, Skill Affinity: Search, Skill Affinity: Spot, Sleeplessness)<br><br>Alignment: Any (Theme: Chaotic Neutral Preferred) <br><br>DOMAINS: Travel (haste), Trickery (improved invisibility)<br><br>DEITIES: Prime: Loki (God of fire and Trickery, and Odin's blood-brother); Second: Thor (God of thunder, weather, and crops; travels the sky in a chariot pulled by two goats,&amp; wields the hammer, Mjolnir)<br><br>FINAL STATS<br>STR: 12<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 10<br>WIS: 18 (34)<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 316 ( &gt; 400 Self-Buffed) <br><br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 23/34/19*<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +6, Mind Effects: +2<br><br>*Note: in addition to stealth &amp; improved invis., it’s an epic cleric; thus, has access to lots of spells granting stat boosts, immunities, protections, magic resistance (SR 38), etc., and s/he's not dispelable. <br><br><br>* Combat Vitals<br><br>BAB: 25<br>AB (naked): 30 (mundane mace), 48 (mundane longbow)<br><br>Divine Power Alone: BAB 30, AB +53 (ranged) / +35 (melee combat)<br>+5 Div.Fav<br>+2 Battletide<br>+1 Bless<br>+1 Aid<br>+1 Prayer<br>+2 Stat boost bonus (Owl's for ranged; Bull’s for melee)<br>--<br>BAB 30, AB +65 (ranged) / +47 (melee, +3 DP STR. bonus and +5 GMW: AB 55)<br>NOTE: DP Exploit: enjoys the maximum number of attacks/round, like a warrior, but with the fourth melee attack coming in at full/max AB; DP also works nicely w. the bow, &amp; stacks with haste – enjoy <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">         <br><br>Capped AB (assuming some magical equipment): <br>Ranged (Longbow): 	BAB 30, AB +74<br>Melee (Mace):		BAB 30, AB +56<br><br><br>Combat Damage:<br>Mundane Longbow: 1d8+7 (crit: 19-20/x3) <br>In addition to epic cleric buffs/enhancements, the AA prestige class grants: Seeker Arrow II, Hail of Arrows, Arrow of Death, and Enchant Arrow VII.

Edit: Oops; Level 18: should read, Extend Spell [-OR-  Knockdown -or- Blind fight)]. Also, forgot to add DP's STR boost to the buffed combat (melee AB) total, thus adding another +3 AB re: mace (or other simple or elf weapon of your choice) -- will PM the changes, and sorry about that. <br><br>I'm still working on that casting-cleric, the Divine Hunter, which is almost done; in the meantime, thought I'd post a fun-filled archer-type build, and "exploit" not only DP but also some of those great comments re: ranged focus, levied at the magistrate build. Thanks, evryone. On this one, if you don't want the versatility of added melee, feel free to change the mace feats for ie., if take extend at 18 (highly recommended), then empower spell and either KD or BF instead of WF:mace, IC:mace, and armor skin perhaps instead of ewf:mace.  <br><br>Another alternative would be to pick up some spell foci. Thanks again, and stay tuned ~ Tyr<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 08/10/06 22:53</span></i></p>

Yes, cleric aas look amazing on paper, but when you get into the game, they disappoint.  Look at the damage.  A whole d8 +5 (div fav +3max other stuff incl str for a mighty bow).   That was the thing I missed out on originally when I did a  cleric/aa so many years ago (and the build was exactly like this, cept i used longsword).   Anyone who takes the 15 bab path with greater than 20 lvls in cleric takes 21 cleric lvls to start.

Yes, I admit it.  The truth is that clerics in nwn are meleeists with support magic spells.  Yes, harm is great.  Yes you can implode.  But in the end, their spell line is more for gettin in to the mix and supporting with buffs and summons (if you are wimpy enough to resort to that <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     )  I just thought I'd throw that out there before you post your cleric caster.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/28/06 00:22:49 (GMT) -- TyrTemplar<br><br>This post is for general information purposes only, and does not constitute a legal opinion or render any legal advice.

What's this?  A Divine Archer with no Divine Might?  Tsk, Tsk.<br><br>By the way, Templar, I'm not sure on this, and I'm not sure what the unwritten rules are, but I believe there might be a handful of builds here already labeled as "Divine Archer".

Yes, cleric aas look amazing on paper, but when you get into the game, they disappoint.  Look at the damage.  A whole d8 +5 (div fav +3max other stuff incl str for a mighty bow).    </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->If the damage is such a problem, then undispellable is a good thing right, to at leats keep what little she gets. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>As for damage, 1d8+5 at lvl 40 isn't exactly what she gets...... It's already 1d8+7 with normal bow and arrows, add DF +5, Battletide +2, both magic, up to 7 more from Mighty bow and STR items. At that lvl you're bound to find some magic arrows of some kind to, I'm sure, say +5. Now we have 1d8+(12-19) depending on STR and mighty properties. And another +7 magic damage. Add to that 6 APR with decent AB, some AoE spells, defensive buffs, summons and damage spells and it's not that hopeless. It's way better than plenty of the DEX-builds that have been frequenting this page.<br><br>Feel I'm defending someone else's build here, but I think it's honestly not that bad.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 08/11/06 13:43:45 (GMT) -- Kamiryn<br><br>Divine Power does not increase BAB but it's a magical AB bonus and counts towards the +20 AB cap.

Heh, thanks Grim, Avado, and everyone. Yeah, he's pretty cool, and even better w. mighty bow and magic arrows <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    But the cleric buffs, spells, and AA, me thinks it makes for a nice spell-bow, too. (Er, even if his name isn't exactly the most creative <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">   (nice to see you, Dwarflord <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>As to DP: What it actually does, among other things, is magically transfer the cleric from its base table to that of the fighter, ie., in this case, from pre-epic bab 15 to warrior's bab 20; in turn, increases your AB across the board, and also brings in fourth attack (ie., like a warrior). Uh: who said exploitation's bad? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   <br><br>As to spell access, it's not actually all that bad: at level 15, gets spell access 7th, the rest in the 20s. If ya want more of the casting route, by all means drop melee/mace stuff for spell foci instead. This be a good alternative, though I admit that said alternate won't please everyone (psst., you caster fans prefer spell foci early, yes? If so, check out Divine Hunter (Cleric of Odin) v. 2). <br><br>What we gots here me thinks is a rather cool spell bow, and he be good fun (thanks: &amp; as usual, interesting discussion and learnin' all around! ~ Tyr <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 08/15/06 22:08</span></i></p>

Hey easy on the girl avado, she ain't TyrPaladin, Deb's a nice person.<br><br>I find myself in agreement with avado though regarding the readability of the post. I like to see the base stats and the leveling guide layed out together without much ado. <br><br>Check out Grim's, or CD's, or Mith's, or Finn's, or GD's builds for example (they are not the only ones to make it right, of course). A short intro (plus a sort story if there's one), the build, then you can go into examining all the details you want and write about all the possible buffing variants. If you do it halfway through the build it makes it messy, IMO.<br><br><br>The build's not bad at all, I would take the Wiz lvl just before going AA though. At 2nd lvl it hurts more then it benefits you.<br><br><br>Regarding the title, it is no surprise there's more than one divine archer already. Considering Deb's creativity I believe it won't be difficult to find an alternative name for the build, so please Deb, suggest one. <br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 08/16/06 12:49</span></i></p>

Hey, Kail: good to see you, and thanks! <br><br>Really gets at the heart of what *is* cleric, doesn’t it? My sister, a 20+ year die-hard fan/veteran PnP player of cleric, and only cleric, shudders to think of having to wait for her foci; she could care less about such things as AB (though, me loves the idea of having both worlds, and reason why I puts spell foci out as an alternative, though to have both necessarily means some waitin’ be in order, which I know die-hard casters don't like, but all 'bout sacrifices... It's a non-ending debate, &amp; one that can often times get heated <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Ah, but for die hard caster fans, like me sister, who want foci &amp; simply can't wait, there be Divine Hunter, Cleric of Odin (v.2), who gets his/her foci right out of the gate, and talk about spell access! (let it never be said that Tyr don’t listen <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   (different builds for different folks, always depending on the environs too of course; this one be a cool spell bow (thanks, Kail; and yeah, not bads at all <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    Oh, &amp; love your idea as to delaying wiz ‘til later; scribe scroll and a familiar be kinda neat, but excellent point do you make (as usual). <br><br>And so, pretty please with scrambled dragon eggs on top, could we incorporate that great idea of yours, and make the following edits? (thanks! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>EDITS<br>02: Cleric(2)  (ie, delaying wizard until level 14)<br>14: Wizard(1): {Scribe Scroll} (now, take yer wizard)<br><br><br>AS TO THE ALTERNATE (I.E., FOR MORE DC/CASTING POWER):<br>If want Spell foci (i.e., for a naked, unbuffed evocat’n DC 28+spell level -and without diluting your ranged focus, all ya needs do, as noted above, is drop mace/melee to instead picks up all yer foci, as follows: <br><br>09: Cleric(9): extend spell (ie., drop wf: mace, and bump up ES instead)<br>12: Cleric(12): WIS+1, spell focus: evocation, (WIS=21) (ie, delaying IC:longbow, but only for 5 levels, as by now you’ve all yer buffs in order, so time for your foci)<br>15: Arcane Archer(1): greater spell focus: evocation (ie., drop IC: mace)<br>18: Arcane Archer(4): improved critical: longbow (ie., where ES was, such that it's open, and time to IC bow)<br>27: Cleric(14): great wisdom I, (WIS=25) (ie., drop ewf: mace, bump up a great wisdom)<br>28: Cleric(15): WIS+1, (WIS=26)<br>29: Cleric(16)<br>30: Cleric(17): epic spell focus: evocation (ie., instead of GrWis, which we took at lvl 27 - &amp; voila: foci <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Note re; domains – if goin’ for DC/casting route, might consider dropping Trickery in favor of Plant; this, since s/he’s got stealth anyway, among other things, takin' plant instead to gets yerself a level 26 creeping doom (note: not only would this be keeping within the theme (Thor rules crops), but we also be talking some kinda serious ant army!!). When you consider that s/he’s also got some really nice, buffable AB and decent damage (just as good as many dexers out there, and equally able to find/use all those great magic arrows, not to mention mighty bow for which being able to buff str to cap be a huge bonus… well,‘nuff said <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br>As to a name, hmmm: yeah, “divine” (as in cleric)  + “archer” (as in, AA/bow focus), not exactly creative, but merely descriptive, isn’t it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">   Good point!
