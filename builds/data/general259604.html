A question of personal opinion this time. I'm looking at a weapon master build that I'm tinkering with, but I just can't seem to make up my mind; scims or battleaxe? Scimitars have a much wider crit range, but a lowever average for crit damage, whereas battleaxes (which I would likely dual wield) have a higher damage output (from x4 crit modifier instead of the scim's x3), but crit less often.<br><br>So, which would each of you prefer and why? Weapons other than scimitar or battleaxe may be considered of course; they were simply for example. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Well I'm no expert but I don't think it's a good idea to duel-wield either of those weapons. If you are duel-wielding and your off hand weapon is anything larger than "small" sized you get a hefty penalty to your AB. Most Weapon Master builds that I have seen, that duel-wield, use Kukris or Short Swords. Short Swords do better damage than Kukris but have a smaller crit range. You also need to take an extra feat, Exotic Weapon, if you want to duel Kukris.<br><br>That all being said, if you still rather use Scimitars or Battle Axes I'd choose Battle Axes, just because they look cool <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Handaxes. Does less damage than battleaxes, but it's easily compensated by the fact that your AB will be 2 higher when dual-wielding. The problem is that there usually aren't many good ones around.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Scythes, scythes and more scythes, X5 critical is death, and you can get a range of 17-20 keened, which is pretty much the minimum, but it's actually quite ok. For dual-wileding, kukris seem to be used a lot, but for dual-wielding WMs I like Double-Axe, X4 critical with no penalty to AB.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/01/06 18:44</span></i></p>

For the best overall damage output, while keeping your AC at it's best, the bastard sword is the best weapon to use.  It's the combo I use the most.  For dual-wield, you have a choice between kukris, scimis, or axes (whether double or battle).  All 3 have their benefits and downsides.<br><br>In the end, besides the damage you can do, it's really about what you want to look at for 40 or so levels.<br><br>All 4 choices above are good choices, but it's also about how you perceive your character and how you want others to do the same.<br><br>Have fun...<br><br>Rooker<br>_________________<br>"We fight not for glory, no riches, no honours, but for freedom alone, which no man gives up except with his life."

Ah, sure, the natural double wielding penalty is always applied, I meant as no size penalties for the weapon, 1d8/1d8 is the highest base damage along with 1d10/1d6 but that need two proficiencies, other weapons will stay behind with 1d6/1d6 if you use light weapons to avoid the penalty. The possibility of a shield with short weapons i sure tempting, flexibility is always good, what I like about double weapons is that they're easier to enhance or buff, without the need of attaining two strong weapons, or as a cleric, only buff once, which could get handy against dispellers.

I don't really have a favourite weapon, but I will tell you what you should look for in a weapon.<br><br>From what you have told us, you want a good Weapon Master Critical Hitter, right? Well me and Kail had a bit of a discussion on this a while ago and though I disagreed with him then, it is in these cases that he is completely correct.<br><br>Kail would likely tell you that using something like a Scimitar will get you a 10-20 critical threat range, though no matter how big your range is, you still have to be able to hit the opponent normally, and then confirm the critical. So what you have to ask yourself, is will your character even hit a target when he rolls a 10? What about with his other 3 attacks? Will a 10 suffice? If it will, then use a Scimitar because hitting 4 criticals in a row.<br><br>But a 10 will likely not hit a decent foe too often unless you are far more powerful than anything on your server. So you should use a weapon with a smaller range, though a larger multiplier. This way, when you hit it will hurt a lot more, gaurenteed.
