Actually, it is possible to get dev crit, epic dodge, and Self Concealment V in one build, but not with dual wielding (weapon finesse, ambidexterity, TWF, and ITWF is just to much to cram in).  Plus, you would basically have to send all your other stats besides str and dex to the crapper (although the RDD bonuses will help them a little).  You could do it with either single wielding (in which case, I'd use a rapier) or with a longbow (preferably with a nice mighty value to take advantage of your strength).  Anyway, here's how you would build the rapier version:<br><br>Race: Elf<br>Starting stats:<br>STR 17<br>DEX 20 (all stat increases go here)<br>CON 7<br>WIS 8<br>INT 8<br>CHA 8<br><br>Pre-epic: Rogue(9)/Bard(1)/RDD(10)<br><br>These can be taken in almost any order, although you'd have to take the bard level by level 10 at the latest, or else you won't be able to get 10 levels of RDD pre-epic.<br><br>Skills: Max Hide and Tumble on every rogue/bard level.  Also make sure you have 8 lore by level 10 at the latest, so that you can get 10 levels of RDD pre-epic.<br><br>Feats: Dodge, Weapon Finesse, Power Attack, Cleave, Great Cleave, Weapon Focus (Rapier), Improved Crit (Rapier)<br><br>Epic: All of these levels are rogue levels.  Make sure to max hide and tumble at each level, at least until they reach 30 ranks each.<br><br>21 - Great Dex I, Improved Evasion<br>22 -<br>23 -<br>24 - Defensive Roll, Overwhelming Critical (Rapier)<br>25 - <br>26 - <br>27 - Epic Dodge, Devastating Critical (Rapier)<br>28 -<br>29 -<br>30 - Great Dex II, Crippling Strike<br>31 -<br>32 - (at this point, you've reached 30 DEX)<br>33 - Self Concealment I<br>34 - <br>35 - SC II<br>36 - SC III<br>37 -<br>38 -<br>39 - SC IV, SC V<br>40 - <br><br><br>Final:<br>Rogue(29)/Bard(1)/RDD(10)<br><br>Stats:<br>STR 25<br>DEX 32<br>CON 9<br>WIS 8<br>INT 10<br>CHA 10<br><br>So, you've got pretty crappy hitpoints (max of 224 I believe) but a naked AC of 29, and you've got dev crit, epic dodge, and SC V.  If you want to do this with a longbow, then switch weapon finesse for point blank shot, and switch all the weapon feats (weapon focus, improved crit, etc.) to longbow instead of rapier.  Honestly it will get creamed solo, but could be a useful companion for a tank character.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 04/12/05 09:54</span></i></p>

WOW thanks for that.

If there's an item to give you ambi/TWF, then switch rapier to short swords in this build and you can certainly dual wield.  Still can't get improved two-weapon fighting, but you'll still have an extra attack at near full AB in your offhand.  The build also has an XP penalty for most of its life, but there's no way around that; an elf is the only race that can make this build work.  And of course, the most important equipment for this build would be CON boosting gear.  Some high level Boots of Striding or Boots of Hardiness would go a loooooooong way in make this build more playable...the low int/wis/cha are no problem in the least, but the low con will hurt unless you boost it.  Of course, it's slightly less of a problem if you are in party with some tanks, especially with the longbow version where you can stay 15 feet away and still sneak attack.  Anyway, I may post this on the epic builds list later today, mostly as a curiosity showing it is theoretically possible to get all of those feats.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 04/12/05 19:32</span></i></p>
