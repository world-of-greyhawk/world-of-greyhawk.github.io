I made this character for PvM. Although it does not include any toughness for HP, the spell casting should be be well worth the trade off. With this build you'll receive a higher AC using Divine Shield and Bardic Song at lvl 17, also gives you +22 HPs. You'll receive 2 lvl 6 spell slots to use up. You can either slide them down to an extended Lvl 5 spells, or use them for Dirge and Energy Buffer. You'll have plenty of spell slots for all your spells to be extended. Curse Song and Taunt will wreck havok on anything hard to hit. You could swap Armor Skin for Toughness for you own desire.<br><br>Good tatics for this build would be to de-armor, cast your buffs, re-armor, unleesh an extended Darkness Spell, perhaps 2, and have at it. You'll have a nice KD on your opponents with all your extended buffs. Your opponents Discipline will drop by 5 points using Cursed Song. When in combat, always flank. If someone switches onto you, KD them for getting in your face and continue to flank using your backstab for more damage. You're not going to be a huge damage threat but you will be there aiding your allies a nice KD and buffs.

Nice build! I think I will be playing it someday.<br><br>I would only do a bit of customization, perhaps trade power attack and cleave at level 1 for lingering song and blind fight freeing an epic feature.

Good build. I'd suggest a couple tweaks for a bit better playability:<br><br>move Bard 8 to level 17 (to top up Tumble), Bard 9 to level 22 (same reason), and either Bard 10 up or Bard 11 down to level 27 (same reason).<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

The spells at 6th lvl should be plenty. I made it the minimum amount someone would need. theres really only 2 spells that would server any real purpose in your journeys, Dirge and Energy Buffer.<br><br>dont get me wrong, i do like the idea of more bard lvls so i can dump extended spell and opt it for still spell. but 17 lvls of bard spell lvls seems pretty quick to me. i might get 2 or 3 battles before they start wearing off. i figure with extend itll double your time so you'll always be ready. this should buy everyone the time to be buffed and make it till next rest period. <br><br>im not sure what kind of worlds everyone plays on, but ive never had a problem worrying about rest time. thats why i opted to take extended for this purpose. if your like me, i usually rest as soon as i can. and if i wasnt ready for any incounter, invis or GS out of there and get ready. always nice to keep a few potions of invis and scrolls of GS around. although there has been some issues with players using those two in order, i think its some NWN bug or something. i also heard the Visage spells somehow effect the GS spell as well. we've got it on some forum somewhere on our PW.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bad213Boy on 11/23/05 16:49</span></i></p>
