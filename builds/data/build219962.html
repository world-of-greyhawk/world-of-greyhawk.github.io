A sniper with fairly decent AB and a death attack for added pain (but weak against crit-immunes). I've gone for death attack here but you could vary the proportions of AA/Assassin taken (*wants some imput from those more knowledgable on what to do*).

You really think so? I'd have thought that here, Rogue would have outshone Assassin in every single way except for the evilness concept - like all that ref save and NO FRIGGIN' EVASION, and like no skillpoints. Argh!

Hmm, seems like there is something I'd do different, probably at the expense of assassin (full disclosure, not my thing).  More bard and more AA for the AB.<br><br>Like taking bard to 8 pre-epic and 11 overall for the +2 AC that that level of bard song gives you.  The clincher would be, is the grimoire Right or Wrong when it says that the curse song requires level 12 bard for the same effect? Or even level 14 bard - that gives you +16 hit points, takes your death attack to 9d6.  <br><br>Don't you need AB 7 to take AA?  If so, I think your level up needs one more level of bard before AA.  <br><br>01: Bard(1): Point Blank Shot<br>02: Bard(2)<br>03: Bard(3): Weapon Finesse*<br>04: Bard(4): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br>05: Bard(5)<br>06: Assassin(1): Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>07: Assassin(2): As: (Uncanny Dodge I)<br>08: Assassin(3): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>09: Assassin(4): Called Shot<br>10: Bard(6)<br>11: Arcane Archer(1)<br>12: Bard(7): DEX+1, Rapid Shot, (DEX=21)<br>13: Arcane Archer(2)<br>14: Arcane Archer(3)<br>15: Arcane Archer(4): Improved Critical: Longbow<br>16: Arcane Archer(5): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>17: Arcane Archer 6 <br>18: Bard(8): Lingering Song<br>19: Arcane Archer(7)<br>20: Arcane Archer (8): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br><br>21: Arcane Archer(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>22: Assassin(5)<br>23: Arcane Archer(10)<br>24: Arcane Archer(11): DEX+1, Epic Prowess, (DEX=24)<br>25: Assassin(6)<br>26: Assassin(7)<br>27: Assassin(8): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=25)<br>28: Assassin(9): DEX+1, (DEX=26)<br>29: Assassin(10): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=27)<br>30: Bard(9): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=28)<br>31: Assassin(11)<br>32: Assassin(12): DEX+1, (DEX=29)<br>33: Assassin(13): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=30)<br>34: Assassin(14): Great Dexterity V^, (DEX=31)<br>35: Bard (10)<br>36: Bard (11)): DEX+1, Great Dexterity VI, (DEX=33)<br>37: Assassin(15)<br>38: Bard (12): Great Dexterity VII^, (DEX=34)<br>39: Bard (13): Great Dexterity VIII, (DEX=35)<br>40: Bard(14): DEX+1, (DEX=36)<br><br>AB: (27 base + 13 Dex + 6 AA + 3 EWF + 1 Epic Prow) = 50 <br><br>Now if you took Rogue instead of assassin, you could do a Bard16/Rogue13/AA11 split, but that would be a completely different build.  <br><br>And if you took Monk instead of Assassin, and Wiz instead of bard, . . . <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br><br>Something like, I don't know, Monk 9 Wiz 9 AA 22. . .

Assassins do get improved invisibility as a class spell, so they aren't all bad, but certainly for most characters I'd take Rogue ahead of them any day and twice on sundays.<br><br>If you want to try the bard/rogue thing, use halfelf, or as it is sometimes called, "the race that the builders forgot."<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

The point of this Ithacan, was to get a good AB ranged Death Attack that had an OK DC - AKA that nasty sniper in the party of evil-fellas. Send the blackguard in to rough things up then appear and paralyze away <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">    <br><br>The AA BAB requirement is 6, like BG.
