I would also advise moving your dual-wielding feats to earlier in the build, and moving your SD pre-reqs back (since you're not taking SD till epic levels).<br><br>Also, you should post your class level next to the character level. This helps readers follow the build, it helps you to spot errors in the build, and generally makes it easier to discuss. For example:<br><br>1 Rogue 1 Ambidexterity<br>2 Fighter 1 Wpn Proficiency: Exotic<br>3 Fighter 2 Wpn Focus: Kukri, Wpn Finesse<br>4 Rogue 2<br>5 Fighter 3<br>6 Fighter 4 Two Wpn Fighting, Wpn Spec: Kukri<br>7 Rogue 3<br>8 Rogue 4<br><br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br><i>"Where there is life, there is hope." - Grover</i>

What abot moving your last fighter level to post epic taking epic weapon specialization. Also a power attack feat might help vs. crit/sneak immune opponents. You porbably could swap out blinding speed and improved expertise for those.
