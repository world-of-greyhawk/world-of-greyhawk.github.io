This is my take on a couple other f10/r10/m20 builds I've seen here.  This one has better AC/AB and the saves are a tad better.<br><br>Now I realize that the damage output is fairly low on this build, however high damage gauntlets are readily available on my server.<br><br>You can try this build with Shadowdancer instead of Rogue.  You'll get Epic Dodge much sooner, level 26 I think.  The downside is the loss of UMD.<br><br>Tested against all the base classes in the Novice to Epic Character Maker it mauled them quite well and took no damage whatsoever.<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   Comments/suggestions welcome.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Damage output is EXTREMELY low - 2d6 unarmed due to small size, -3 due to Str, is an everage of only 4 per hit. You have plenty of fighter levels, why on earth didn't you at least take WS/EWS? <br><br>Also, you focused on both kamas and unarmed. I would pick 1 or the other. With a halfling, dual-wielding kamas costs you -4 to AB instead of -2, so I would drop the TWF feats and either use a single kama or go unarmed. Spend some of those feats on WS/EWS for either kamas or unarmed (+6 per hit will more than double your damage output as is).<br><br>TM

Like so many builds of late, Epic Dodge comes at Lvl39, if it comes at all.  Why?  You could easily qualify for it much earlier.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Damage is still horrible.  You only added ws..  WOW.   I think what others were sayin is move around the monk lvls with rog lvls to get epic dodge at around 24ish!  Take one lvl ftr epic to get the +6 damage.  You will still suck (damage wise) just not as badly.   <br><br>I would also drop the 16 wis to 14 (maybe??) and get your str to 10 so you at least wont have a penalty!  The one AC wont hurt you as much as rollin "wpn ineffective"'s will.  <br><br>I would also think of takin more rogue lvls (in lieu of monk) to get more sneak damage...  and to maybe bring ftr/monk lvls into alignment so you dont have the xp penalty.

I agree with the other posters, but I also have another slight tweak.  You should take Epic Weapon Focus (Unarmed) before you take Epic Prowess.  EWF gives a +2, and EP only gives a +1.<br>_________________<br>There's always time to procrastinate.

I still think you are missing out on a few things.<br><br>1 - switch to a kama. The damage does not depend on your monk level, and you get to add the enhancement to the damage (so a kama +4 does more average damage than your max unarmed anyway, and you don't even reach that until level 36). This will also allow you wear gauntlets of dex, freeing up your belt slot for a belt of giant str, so you can do some str damage even with your low starting str.<br><br>2 - move some of those fighter levels into epic and some Rogue and Monk levels into pre-epic. You don't need all of those epic feats - your reflex save is already very high, and even the fort and will saves are decent. You could easily drop Luck of Heroes and Lightning Reflexes and still have good saves. You don't really need Mobility for anything - once Tumble is 17 or higher you won't get hit by AoO's anyway. Move at least 2 fighter levels into epic, and move at least 2 Rogue levels into pre-epic. This gives you a fighter bonus feat for EWS in epic, and lets you take Epic Dodge at level 27. You also get some UMD and sneak damage much sooner that way. You might even want to drop a few fighter levels completely for more Rogue (swapping 4 would cost you 1 net feat, but gain you some skillpoints, 2 sneak damage dice, and let you get ED at level 24, while costing just 1 AB. You could also add in Crippling Strike, an excellent rogue feat).<br><br>3 - Skills. Take Rogue at level 1 for the skill bonus (gains you 24 skill points compared to fighter).<br><br>Starting stats: You might want to drop WIs to 14, and either bump Dex to 20 and Str to 8, or Str to 11. I prefer even stats, so I would go Dex 20, Str 8. Frees up another epic feat.<br> <br>TM
