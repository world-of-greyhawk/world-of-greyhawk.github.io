I remember when I started out.  I played EVERYTHING that sounded good.  I started so many characters, lord, i think the only class i never really played was Blackguard.. which, come to think of it, i did, but it was on a lv 20 dragonlance server sometime in 2005 or so!<br><br>I really wanted my dwarf wizard/PM/fighter to be good, but he wasnt.  I tried out the Cleric/wm/defender, but that didnt fly!  IT got to the point where i was trying "concept" builds cuz i just wanted something new.  Ever been there?  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    <br><br>Hence THIS topic.  This is NOT "Uberist build" post!  Lord knows i love those <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    What i was thinking recently, was, maybe, for the sake of "new" or inexperienced players who ask, maybe it would be helpful for those of us who are near the end of our days of play to put down in one place, 1) What build, of all the ones you played, was the one that brought you the most Joy (with a link to it), 2) Why is it your favorite?<br><br><br><br>My all time FAVORITE nwn build, EVER??  Can you guess...  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    )i am staying from PRC cuz that isnt right!)<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "243768", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Blood And Faith (Bard 4 / Cleric 26 / RDD 10)</a> by the MITH!<br><br>I credit this build with some of the BEST play time i have had in nwn.  I remember one time, i was chatting with a guy and he just couldnt get the idea of a cleric with dev crit.  If i must explain it too you.. i cant!  Its like Julianne Moore..  How do you explain why she's just soo dam sexy!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Playing with this build made me realize that clerics dont need high spell DC.  They need a board, some good plate, a fine killing instrument (yes, i am not fond of ALL clerical ideals!) and a few well planned spells, and mixing it up is where they belong!  <br><br>Taking the most lethal class with RDD is absolutely sick.  Being able to back up with AoE spells like SOV and Firestorm gets you is godly.  Not to mention the +8 dodge AC from Bard.  And if you need it, UMD (i never seem to have needed that, but sometimes Monk Boots ARE good things to have).<br><br>The other thing this build taught me was the POWER in 3/4 BAB clerics with SICK ab!  20 straight cleric lvls became the "way" to do things (pre-1.69)  Even today, IF i were to start a new pw, this is the character i would play.  <br><br>All i can say is, THANKS Mith.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted <b>06/23/04</b> 21:16 (GMT) -- Anuis<br><br>Suolucider, Blitz 04, <b>avado</b>, Quisition, Boourns, ... welcome to the guild!

My favorite build? that's easy, Druid 26 / Monk 4 / Champion of Torm 10, though I never really got it to level 40, after Dragon Shape I normally don't level up very much.<br><br>Why? it's the heavy Druid shifter build, all the spellpower, focused in Conjuration, with Monk skilldumps and cheese. CoT won't give XP penalty, requires no alignment change, gets Great Wisdom as bonus feat and improves shifted saves. Simple and effective, that's my style.<br><br>I don't have a link to that build, I didn't post it. I don't remember if someone else posted that same build, it happened a lot that I didn't post some builds because they were already there when I got to the guild, and I wasn't a Druid lover back then. Right now it seems like a too simple build to deserve posting.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 10/09/09 03:48</span></i></p>

I like playing Bards, Arcane archers, fighter types and Sorcerers. <br>Earlier i used to play rogues a lot, but Bards and Assassins have taken over that spot. Most of the characters i play have stealth, and often they have levels of Shadowdancer.<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "183105", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Yar Stardawg's Priest of the Shadows: Cleric 26 / Monk 9 / Shadowdancer 5 </a>Was an eye opener to me. He showed me how to build a dex based cleric with ED. <br><br>You don't have to play the Cleric in full plate like Avado does.<br>The Priest of the Shadows is a very good sneaker with HIPS, a high dex and the trickery domain ability.<br>It is hard to hit with a good AC, ED and undispellable improved invisibility.<br>The AB is better than your normal sneaker thanks to the cleric buffs.<br>The damage output is also very good for a dexer thanks to the buffs and the monk attack table. You don't rely on sneak attacks like the rogues do.<br>You have the full cleric spell selection, giving great flexibility and making you less dependant on items.<br>You get well rounded saves with high fort and wis from cleric, refl from Dex (and SD) and a boost to all from Monk.<br><br>I customized the build a little for my own use. I took war domain rather than strength. I could do with fewer extended DPs and wanted to self buff dex. I also sacrificed 1AB to be able to take SD pre epic and stopped at Wis 20 to be able to get Dex higher.<br><br>What I got was a sneaker, a frontline brawler and an indispellable caster rolled into one character.<br>_________________<br>There are no facts, only interpretations.
