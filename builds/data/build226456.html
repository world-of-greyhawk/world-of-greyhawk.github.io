Yes dex bonus does add to ref save. But you don't get the point. Wearing armor caps the dex bonus to AC <b>only</b>, it doesn't affect at all the ref save or the bonus the ref save gets from a high dex.<br><br>EDIT: Your dex, in fact, doesn't get affected at all. You have (f.e.) 34 dex with or without heavy armor. And you can have weapon finesse and wear heavy armor without any penalty to AB, cause your dex bonus to AB does not get affected. Only the bonus to AC gets capped.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 01/10/06 21:53</span></i></p>

As a matter of fact, dexers start wearing heavy armor (if they have the profinciecy) and gradually wear lighter armor (lower cap)as they dex increases till they wear no armor at all when their dex is high enough, cause they'd get less AC from wearing armor than from being naked.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>I never knew the game worked like that so again I'm sorry if I seemed stubborn.
