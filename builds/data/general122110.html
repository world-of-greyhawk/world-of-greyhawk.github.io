I have been enjoying reading, and playing, these epic builds.  Then I had a thought - What if all these talented character builders tried to make the WORST possible character?  Can they come up with the sorriest possible combination of classes, races, levels, skills, and feats? (I'm betting on lots of Harper Scouts!)<br>So how about it?  Anyone up to this challenge?

hey billbo<br><br>you don,t have to ...i had it in my notes<br> <br>worst char build by...cdaulepp     45 hp<br><br><a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=313388&amp;forum=81&amp;sp=390" target="_blank">Click Here</a>..9th post<br><br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">       <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">   better still i,ll post it <br>     -  -   -    -   -    -    -    -     -    -<br>cdaulepp <br>Game Owner<br>NWN<br>NWN: SoU<br>NWN: HotU<br><br><br>Joined: 10 Aug 2003 Posted: Thursday, 05 February 2004 07:03PM <br>Quote: Posted 02/05/04 12:46:41 (GMT) by Torias<br><br>I'm compiling / testing builds for Jay to put into a bioware wednesday article.<br><br>The criteria I'm using:<br>a) it WORKS (which is actually difficult to get exactly right without testing in game and leveling all the way to 40) <br><br>My build works. I've tested it.<br><br><br>Quote: <br>b) the character has a clear concept. A primary focus (melee, ranged, spells) and a primary capability (sneak attack, devastating criticals, divine powers)<br><br>This build of mine is the ultimate craft armor machine.<br><br><br>Quote: <br>c) a detailed layout showing:<br>starting stats<br>class, skill point allocation, feat selection, ability increase at each character level. Preferably noting which feats are optional and which are mandatory for the build to work. <br><br>OK. done. see the build below.<br><br><br>Quote: <br>d) ideally, it's unique in some way, it's the BEST at one particular thing. Currently, I don't think there are any really good ranger builds listed in the thread (I might have missed one, no insult intended), <br><br>This build is the best at crafting armor and getting killed.<br><br><br>Quote: <br>e) give it a concept name, something cheesy  <br><br>I call this build the "Brando"<br><br><br>Quote: <br>f) it doesn't rely on exploiting bugs or "rules divergences that have unintend consequences". Primarily multiclassing monks with full bab classes to get more than 5 base unarmed attacks, and having a monk dual wielding kamas (getting off hand attacks when they shouldn't).<br><br>I currently have 9 pages of shortlisted builds in a word doc to create / test in nwn... happy to add more if they get posted here  <br><br>Starting Elf Rogue Chaotic Evil so people can use smite good on me!<br><br>Stats:<br>Str: 9<br>Dex: 18<br>Con: 7<br>Int: 9<br>Wis: 18<br>Cha: 9<br><br>Bump dexterity at: 4,12,20,28,36<br>Bump wisdom at: 8,16,24,32,40<br><br>You take your levels like this:<br>*1 Rogue<br>*19 wizard<br>*20 sorcerer<br><br>Your final stats look like this:<br>Str: 9 <br>Dex: 23<br>Con: 7 <br>Int: 9 <br>Wis: 23 <br>Cha: 9 <br><br>You are unable to cast any sorcerer or wizard spells. You get 1 hit point per level except the first 3 because it makes you roll your maximum. I was first hoping because of the -2 modifier to constitution that I would be able to get a 0 each time, but alas, it seems the Gods are against me, and I have to take at least 1 hit point each level. <br><br>Feat Progression looks like this:<br>LVL ___ Feat<br>-------------<br>1 Craft Wand<br>3 Brew Potion<br>6 Shielf Proficiency<br>6 No feat* (wizard bonus feat)<br>9 Weapon Proficiency Simple<br>11 No feat* (wizard bonus feat)<br>12 Skill Focus: craft armor<br>15 Weapon Proficiency Exotic<br>16 No feat* (wizard bonus feat)<br>18 Armor Proficiency Medium <br>21 Extend Spell<br>24 Empower Spell<br>27 Maximize Spell<br>30 Epic Skill Focus: Craft Armor<br>33 Silent Spell<br>36 Still Spell<br>39 Armor Proficiency Heavy<br><br>*at levels 6, 11, and 16 you would normally get a wizard bonus feat but because there are no wizard feats left to choose from you just have to hit okay. You don't get a bonus feat. <br><br>Don't spend your skill points, except for craft armor. Don't wear anything but your underwear. Don't use a weapon. Fight bare-handed.<br><br>AC = 16<br><br>Hit point calculation:<br>+4 (level 1)<br>+2 (level 2)<br>+2 (level 3)<br>+37 (37 levels getting 1 hit point each time)<br>-----<br>45 Total hit points at level 40.<br><br>Fort: 15<br>Refl: 24<br>Will: 26<br><br>Unarmed Attacks: +18/+13<br>Damage: 1-3 -1 (Critical 20/x2)<br><br>This build is so fun to play. You can see how many armors you can craft before you get killed. And everybody will be coming to ask for your help, because you are a crafting machine. I wouldn't brag about your abilities though, because every person in the game will be able to kill you. But when people need that "very special armor look" that only you can provide, you'll be everybody's new best friend.<br><br>Enjoy.<br><br>cdaulepp<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 04/25/04 20:21</span></i></p>
