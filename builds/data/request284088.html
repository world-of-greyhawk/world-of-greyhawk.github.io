Perhaps someone can help a newbie here, I play a server that has a lot of PvP, I keep getting destroyed by PM combo's. I tried a Fighter/wiz/RDD, as well as a Fighter/WM/COT. The server allows up to 40 levels, and dec crit is allowed. I need a suggestion for a build that can stand up to a Pm and win. I have looked over the builds allready posted. Also tried Nwikki for helCould someone recommend a build that will work.<br><br>Thanks

What's the magic level of your server? What are these Pale Masters doing that kills you so easily? Are they meleers or casters?<br><br>I'd be interested to see how you built a FTR/<b>WIZ</b>/RDD... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  nice trick on that build.<br><br>Pale Masters have high ACs, I'd use a caster, take a Sorcerer 37 / Paladin 1 / Blackguard 2 and your saves will be high enough for those dev crits as well.
