<b>I Am A:</b> Chaotic Evil Elf Mage Druid<br><br><i>Alignment:</i><br><b>Chaotic Evil</b> characters are the most 'evil' people out there. They are willing to do anything to get ahead, and will kill anyone who stands in their way. A chaotic evil person sees no value in order and governments, and believes to the utmost in the tenant that 'Might Makes Right'.<br><br><i>Race:</i><br><b>Elves</b> are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.<br><br><i>Primary Class:</i><br><b>Mages</b> harness the magical energies for their own use. Spells, spell books, and long hours in the library are their loves. While often not physically strong, their mental talents can make up for this.<br><br><i>Secondary Class:</i><br><b>Druids</b> are a special variety of Cleric who serves the Earth, and can call upon the power in the earth to accomplish their goals. They tend to be somewhat fanatical about defending natural settings.<br><br><i>Deity:</i><br><b>Velsharoon</b> is the Neutral Evil god of necromancy, liches, and undeath. He is also known as the Vaunted, the Archmage of Necromancy, and the Lord of the Forgotten Crypt. His followers practice the necromantic arts, and raise the dead to do their bidding. His symbol is a crowned skull.<br><br>*~*~*<br><br>Hm, last time I was a Chaotic Evil Half-Orc Mage Thief.

Alignment:<br>Lawful Neutral characters believe in the triumph of law and order above all else. It does not matter whether the leader is for good or evil; the leader will be followed, because the order they provide is the most important thing.<br><br>Race:<br>Halflings are short and fat, like minuature people. (Think 'Hobbits') They enjoy the easy life, but aren't averse to the idea of an adventure from time to time. They get along with all races, and are known for their senses of humor. Halflings also tend to be light of foot, and can move quietly when necessary.<br><br>Primary Class:<br>Rangers are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.<br><br>Secondary Class:<br>Monks are strange and generally not understood by the world at large. They live apart from people, and follow strict codes that restrain their behavior and lifestyle. They have an exceptionally calm outlook on life, and generally do not resort to violence unless absolutely necessary. Even when they do, their code of conduct forbids the use of all weapons - except their hands. As such, monks are extremely skilled at hand-to-hand combat, and no other style.<br><br>Deity:<br>Urogalan is the Lawful Neutral halfling god of death and earth. He is also known as He Who Must Be and the Lord in the Earth. His followers guard the dead and protect halflings from those that don't stay buried. Their preferred weapon is the flail. Urogalan's symbol is a silhouette of a dog's head.

His followers are working to secure his position as a new god, and are in conflict with many worshippers of other deities. They wear black or dark purple robes, with silver trimming, and wear silver bracelets. Cyric's symbol is a skull set in a purple starburst.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...

Details, huh? Cool <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">          (note, as Avado did, I, too, retook the test, just so it's fair and all, ... and the results are:<br><br>You Are A: <br>Lawful Good Human Paladin Bard, Follower Of Tyr<br><br>Alignment:<br>Lawful Good characters are the epitome of all that is just and good. They believe in order and governments that work for the benefit of all, and generally do not mind doing direct work to further their beliefs.<br><br>Race:<br>Humans are the 'average' race. They have the shortest life spans, and because of this, they tend to avoid the racial prejudices that other races are known for. They are also very curious and tend to live 'for the moment'.<br><br>Primary Class:<br>Paladins are the Holy Warriors. They have been chosen by a God/dess to be their representative on Earth, and must follow the code of that deity, or risk severe penalties. They tend towards being righteous, but not generally to excess.<br><br>Secondary Class:<br>Bards are the entertainers. They sing, dance, and play instruments to make other people happy, and, frequently, make money. They also tend to dabble in magic a bit.<br><br>Deity:<br>Tyr is the Lawful Good god of justice. He is also known as Tyr Grimjaws, Wounded Tyr, the Maimed God, and Blind Tyr. He appears as a warrior, missing his hand. Followers of Tyr are concerned first and foremost with justice - discovering the truth and punishing the guilty for their crimes. They wear blue and purple robes with a white sash, a white gauntlet on the left hand, and a black gauntlet on the right, to symbolize Tyr's lost hand. Their preferred weapon is the warhammer. Tyr's symbol is a set of scales resting on a warhammer.<br><br>Hmmm. That would explain a lot <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     Bard almost tied with FTR this time, and elf a close second to human this time around so gave me human - interesting stuff!

This is what I am, be careful of incurring in my wrath! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>Lawful Evil Elf Mage Cleric<br>Follower Of Velsharoon<br><br>Alignment:<br>Lawful Evil characters believe that a nice, orderly system of life is perfect for them to abuse for their own advancement. They will work within 'the system' to get the best that they can for themselves.<br><br>Race:<br>Elves are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.<br><br>Primary Class:<br>Mages harness the magical energies for their own use. Spells, spell books, and long hours in the library are their loves. While often not physically strong, their mental talents can make up for this.<br><br>Secondary Class:<br>Clerics are the voices of their God/desses on Earth. They perform the work of their deity, but this doesn't mean that they preach to a congregation all their lives. If their deity needs something done, they will do it, and can call upon that deity's power to accomplish their goals.<br><br>Deity:<br>Velsharoon is the Neutral Evil god of necromancy, liches, and undeath. He is also known as the Vaunted, the Archmage of Necromancy, and the Lord of the Forgotten Crypt. His followers practice the necromantic arts, and raise the dead to do their bidding. His symbol is a crowned skull.<br><br><i>Edit</i>: in <a href="http://members.aol.com/gaijintrader/faction.html" target="_blank">this survey</a> I end up being a Dragon with affinity to Phoenix though... how comes it doesn't surprise me? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Wait for me Dragon, we'll meet in the sky<br>By fire and magic, I'm sworn<br>Hell is calling, we cannot be denied<br>Fly to the blackness of the Storm<br><br>We must die to be reborn!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 07/01/06 10:25</span></i></p>

In Kail's survey I also was a Dragon, with an affinity towards Crab.  Again a magic user with leanings towards fighting(violence).  Guess that kinda backs up my Half-Orc Wizard/Fighter from the first survey.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

She is also known as the Lady of the Forest, and is the Patron of Rangers. Her followers are devoted to nature, and believe in the positive and outreaching elements of it.

On Tyr's test I ended up as a chaotic neutral human fighter/ranger, follower of Tempus.
