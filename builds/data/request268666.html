My friend said to go 26 ranger/ 9 monk/ 5 SD. Similar to the Kama Fury, but with a bonus feat instead of the +1 monk AC. How good are these ranger builds vs a STR based WM?

As a general rule, a dex-based build with ED will beat a str-based build, as long the magic level is high enough that both need 20's to hit. The reason is that the dexer will hit the non-ED build once every 4 or 5 rounds with natural 20's. But the Str-build will need to roll 2 20s in a single roung to hit the ED build, which means one hit every 40 rounds or so (less if they also have 50% concealment).<br><br>TM

The items really only get up to about +5 on the server I play on, so you can expect a str build with a sword and shield's AC to be about 57 without expertise or imp expertise. Yet you can also expect their AB to be around 62, with dev crit DCs in the upper 40s? Great Fort and Epic Fort are life savers.

Well, if items only go to +5, you can only expect to get an AC of around 65 or so as a dexer. If AB's are in the low 60's, you will be taking more than 1 hit per round on a regular basis, even with concealment. <br><br>In that case, I would say it depends on True Sight. If True Sight is available on items, then the Str-build is going to win (probably on a crit). If True Sight is not easily available, then your Ranger/Monk/SD build can use HiPS to get in an IKD, a few hits, the HiPS again. Given that strategy, I would recommend adding a few levels of Rogue instead of Ranger for some sneak damage to leverage those attacks from stealth or while they are knocked down.<br><br>TM

But...When you take into account Epic Dodge, essentially +5 AC, since you're skipping to the next attack which is often 5 AB less, it's 70. Then when you add in Expertise, it's 75. Then adding in Shadow Evade, if you're a Shadow Dancer, You get bonus AC and concealment. And haste, if you can manage to get it, is another +4 AC. <br>One problem is, you can't HiPS in PvP <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  but one of the best builds I found was the 11/19/10. My friend had one, and went up again several 12/25/3 WMs, and beat them fairly easily. They basically had to spam KD lol.<br>And no, True Site can't be obtained from items.

The most obvious reason to go ranger is to get BoE added to the base damage bonus you get against your FEs.<br>That damage boost is welcome in a dexer build.<br>You need 21+ lvls of ranger to get BoE.<br>For PvP you need the 7 PC races as FE. You will need more than 21 ranger lvls to get that many FE, unless you use epic feats to get them.<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan
