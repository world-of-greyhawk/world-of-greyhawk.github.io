Hi guys,<br>Can you help me out with this AA build?<br><br>I want the following:<br>- lingering song<br>- curse song<br>- still spell<br><br>- max tumble<br>- good UMD<br>- good taunt<br>- max disc<br><br>And of course the best possible AB and AC from all the AA levels.<br><br>My opinion is that the 2way swing of bard song + curse song are the shizzle.<br><br>Please state your build, thanks!

Why Still Spell? You won't be wearing armour or using a shield.

Elf Bard16/AA24. As many AA levels as you can get before 20.<br><br>Stats something like:<br>Str 14 (for composite bows = mighty)<br>Dex 16 (where most stat points go)<br>Con 10<br>Wis 10<br>Int 12 (need this for skill points)<br>Cha 15 (one stat point here)<br><br>For skills you will also need to pump up Perform and you should pump up Spellcraft too. You might even swap Int and Str scores.<br><br>You might also consider 4 RDD levels in exchange for 4 AA levels, to get an extra 4 STR. You could then start with 10/16/10/10/14/16.

You lose a bonus feat from the above combo, but gain a lot of AC and other abilities. Just make sure you take the PM levels post 20 to keep your AB at a 3 attack per round range.<br><br>Finally you could mix a fighter type class in the mix to get to a 4 attack AB. 4 levels of fighter is enough to get you epic weapon specialization if you take that 4th level on one of your feat levels after 20.

IE, 14, 18, 22, 26 and 30. So these levels are good ones to stop at, or one higher - AAs get an extra +1 to attack and damage (with a bow) at every odd-numbered level. that said, 24 is one of the worst levels to stop at for an AA. Doesn't get you anything that AA 23 doesn't.

Aye my bad.... again. I have to stop doing some things from memory. Even better is that would easily open up some levels for other classes to be worked in.<br><br>Definatley the best two in my opinion are bard/pm/aa and bard/rdd/aa combos. One for dev critting bows and the other for immunity to that.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Bard 16 is to maximise song benefits. I agree that you could stop AA levels earlier, but if you go to 22 to max AA levels then possibly SD is the best class to take up the slack.<br><br>I too like Bard/RDD/AA builds, but they aren't builds for making big use of Bardsong.
