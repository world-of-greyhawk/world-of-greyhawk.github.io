If you want really good saving throws, then you did this backwards.<br><br>Instead of Wizard you want Sorc.<br><br>And instead of Rogue, you want Paladin or Blackgaurd.<br><br>The Charisma of the Wizard will fuel the Paladin's Divine Grace and give your Charisma bonus to all of your saves in addition to the normal attributes that go towards saves.<br><br>Look at the Exalted Sorceress thing. Thats what I'm talking about and I think it would get better saves than anything else. Especially if you went and got all the Saving Throw feats. Those are kinda a waist but if you want Saving throws, thats how you get them.

Your DCs are good, no question, but:<br><br>in your 3 chosen schools, for your level 9 spells, you'll have DCs of 10 + 20 (INT modifier) + 9 (spell level) + 4 (Grtr Spell Focus) = 43.<br><br>In the other schools, your DCs will be 39.<br><br>(and that's if you're buffed to the +12 cap).<br><br>Now, take a look at <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "200316", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>This Guy</a>.

As noted, there is no way to beat the SR of a pure monk who take enough Improved SR feats. But, such a monk will have low AB, low damage, and poor resistances, so just put up a Mestil's Acid Sheathe and an Elemental Shield and let him hit you - he'll die first, assuming he can hit you at all depending on your AC.<br><br>For spell DC, I would keep the Necromancy foci, but drop the Evocation foci. Evocation has Ice Storm and IGMS, which have no saves, so just use them if you face someone with high saves. Boosting the DC of Wail of the Banshee and Finger of Death is worthwhile, so keep Necromancy. Try to fit Epic Spell Focus in if you can for another +2.<br><br>Other than that, you might want to consider taking some other feats for defensive use - Auto=still, etc.<br><br>TM
