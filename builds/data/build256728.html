As of a recent patch (not sure exactly which one), Weapon Finesse works shifted.  Of course, it only matters in forms which have higher dex than str, but I think you have a couple of those.

well, since golem and dragon are the main forms Finesse does bupkus.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

Finesse indeed does remarkably little... the only druid shape that has a higher dex than str is the elder air elemental, and the only shifter shape of note that has a higher dex than str is the kobold commando/epic kobold commando (and I think he might get finesse for free; I forget and am too lazy to look it up pre-coffee).<br><br>Solid build, a shifter that works out well on a high magic server is a nice accomplishment.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Perhaps you should name the server this build is suited for.  Those item merging calculations are not standard issue.
