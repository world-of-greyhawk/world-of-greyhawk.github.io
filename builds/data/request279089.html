You do know caster types are some of the best PvP in general terms right? mage killers aren't all that easy or 100% effective, a heavy sneaker with HiPS might do the trick...  sorry, no links, but try <a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">this</a>.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Are you looking solely for a mage killer, or do you want to be able to use this character for other purposes? If the former, then I suggest a high SR Monk build. Pure Monk is probably the way to go, picking up as many SR feats as  you can. Go high WIS and Zen Archery to tackle them from range and you should be golden.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Probably the best mage-killer is another mage with Superior Initiative.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

You could try a str based monk28 bard2 rdd10 with some epic feats sunk into epic acid resistance. That way you could run up unafraid of his spells and lay into him while ignoring his elemental shield and acid sheath. The second level of bard actually allows you to use a crafted wand of lesser spell breach, which allows you to not only dispell him, but get the bigby off you.
