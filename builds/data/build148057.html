<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>This is a curiosity build. I was wondering if it would be possible to get Dev Crit, Damage Reduction, <i>and</i> Epic Dodge in the same build.

I just got that testing mod and tested my build on it. It took out the mage, cleric, rogue, and the fighter in 1 hit each. I had a hard time hitting the Prismatic Dragon but on avg I killed it in 7 rounds. The Dracolich gave me the biggest trouble because it is immune to crits and it kept healing itself but I eventually just whacked it to death. See general discussion for some questions I have though about it.

<b>Most builds I make can take out all of these with HotU level equipment. Basic items only the shadow archer could take out the Prismatic Dragon. </b><br><br>For testing I usually use a magic weapon and a magic armor only, without a magic weapon you'd have little chance getting through DR. The armor you'll need in melee, otherwise you'll stand no chance against the magic weapons your opponents use. Only casters and archers probably can do without any magic equipment.<br><br><br>Perhaps we should set a testing standard, so it's easier to compare builds when people say they could beat some enemy. One person tests with all possible high level equipment, while the other uses only basic items and again another limits it to magic weapon and armor only (like me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> ). If everyone tests differently, it's useless to compare unless you know exactly how the other was testing.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Dimundome on 08/17/04 07:50</span></i></p>
