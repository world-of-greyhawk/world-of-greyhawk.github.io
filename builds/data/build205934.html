The name says Banebow and perhaps drop weapon focus in shortsword? This would could give a free slot for a thing like Called Shot. I haven't much used it, sinc ei haven't played for some time, but i have heard that it is really useful.

In my opinion I would drop both Weapon Finesse and Weapon Focus (short sword) with either Toughness or Blind-Fight (depending on which server you play or which campaign your running) and Called Shot.

This also frees up an epic feat.  Shame you can't get another AA in there or you could get a couple more DEX out of it.
