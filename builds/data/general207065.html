My favourite PW is having maintenence downtime and so I've spent some free time to work on a search engine for the epic builds forum. It's extremely simple and uses javascript, which turned out to be even slower than I thought, but as far as I know it's the only way to search the epic builds forum and so I'm posting a link here anyway. If you like it or have suggestions please post here, if it turns out people like it I'll try to make improvements. Notice that it is currently very slow, taking about 20 seconds per search on my machine, but if you have patience you will get the results. As for how to use it that will probably be self-explanatory. If not, post any questions here.<br><br>It can be found <a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/search/builds.htm" target="_blank">here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By pulse cap on 08/04/05 03:06</span></i></p>

Firefox seems to be the issue here, I just downloaded it and I'm now seeing all the numbers as described. I used an external css file to hide these, seems firefox doesn't like those.

It now works considerably faster (but still pretty slowly) and I fixed a typo i made in the firefox-fix that made it use barbarian regardless of what you chose.

At least in IE, visibility:hidden just makes text invisible, it still takes up the same space. Problem was that Firefox wouldn't read my external css file, I probably made some error in the syntax that was allowed by IE but not FF. Instead of hunting for the syntax errer I just moved the css info into the html file to save time.

Just a little side comment.<br>You might want to add the class Illusionist to your input fields, since it is different (in spelling) from a Wizard, and some (older) builds use that instead of Wizard in the listing.

I just realised you can exclude builds with certain classes by entering 0 to 0, like:<br><br>21 to 40 druid<br>0 to 0 monk<br>0 to 40 barbarian<br><br>for epic druids with no monk levels. Perhaps I'm the last to think of this, or maybe it will help someone.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By pulse cap on 08/05/05 18:03</span></i></p>

Instead of making it absolute exact, you can make advanced type of search using what you have right now.. and make a simple one which you can put in two or three fields...<br><br>All three would be class types, and in each of them, you would have either "Select one" or blank if you only are looking for builds with two similaries in classes that you want, or whichever you want...<br><br>So if you have no numbers and so on... just classes. You want any builds with paladin in it... then you would get list of all builds that has that class. Same up to three fields of classes.... but if you want something more specific, you then use the advanced search, which would be when you select the class and you enter the specific number of levels that you are looking for in that class and so on...<br><br>Sorry for rambling, but hope it is detailed enough...<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.

If I understand you correctly, this can be done as it is.<br><br>To get any builds that contain a certain class regardless of the amount of levels, just leave the numbers at 1-40.<br><br>If you want to use only one or two fields (or even none for a complete list), choose any class on the "unused" lines (easiest is to just leave it at barbarian) and change the level requirement to 0-40. Classes that are not used in a build count as 0.<br><br>Finally to exclude all builds that use a certain class, select that class on one of the lines and enter 0-0 as the requirement.

Yeah, to be honest, implementing changes like that are a bit silly, since it adds only an additional complication, and does not in fact improve upon the search engine in any way.  As pulse has pointed out, everything that's been suggested can already be done quite easily with the current search engine.  GoVols problem had nothing to do with exact values, which are absolutely not needed.  His problem was that he put together an impossible search which required a character of less than 40 total levels.  If he had just left the paladin part at the default 1-40, or even left all of them at 1-40, he would have had no problem finding his build.  Exact values are irrelevant, but you can't search a database of level 40 characters for a character with no more than 37 levels and expect to get a result.<br><br>Steve

Sorry for the confusion... what I was suggesting was to make it to be user-friendly. And have advanced options for those who knows how to use the search engine.<br><br>User-friendly would just have three options, select the classes you want to find then search.. it will give you list of classes that you want to find.

Err.. I'm actually working on a new "advanced" search with unlimited criteria and some boolean operators. I suppose I'll need to have a simple, medium, advanced. When I made the one that is currently online I was hoping that less advanced users would just leave the level requirments as they are (1-40), thus simply searching for any combination of three specified classes.

Hey guys, new here, Search Engine and guild sources are great!  IDK what happened, but I have trouble with the search engine now, I search for a build and get a list of results, but when it goes to the log-in screen from there I get redirected to the Bioware Accounts page.  I can still view builds if I go through the actual list manually, I just seem to be getting some sort of redirect when I attempt to view the builds.  Any help would be appreciated.<br>(I go to <a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/search/builds.htm" target="_blank">http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/search/builds.htm</a>  Look for build from there, select one, get sent to <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/login/oops.html" target="_blank">http://nwn.bioware.com/login/oops.html</a>  after entering log-in info, I end up at <a href="http://accounts.bioware.com/" target="_blank">http://accounts.bioware.com/</a>  instead of viewing the build...)

Try logging in at bioware (or our guild, or the NWN forums) then move to the search engine from that same window and see if you still get redirected when accessing a specific build.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?

Yeah Grimnir, DL here too...<br>Tried your guys's ideas on logging in first... still have problems.  It's only the Links via the Search Engine that redirect me, I have a few builds bookmarked, and the log-in screen for those lead to the correct site/build info.<br>Even when logged in already, attempting to view a build through the Search Engine list, has the build come up in a new window, I have to log-in that new window, even though I already logged in thru another window... (If that makes sense)  I tried that Auto-login from account settings too, I still get the log-in screen from selecting builds sorted by the search engine...

Not likely.  It's been pushed for in the past, and with no results.  The only way it could get done is if someone with the know-how would be willing to sit down and do it all.  <br><br>And the way that it works is it draws key words from the thread titles in the index (as well as numbers) so that you can then find the builds in the search engine.

Thanks for all your efforts Pulse.  I just tried going to the old version but it seems the site has been taken down?  I've also gone to the new site and it is very well done.  The search wasn't working when I just tried but I know it's still under construction.  Also, you porbably may know this already but the screen looked normal on Firefox but not on IE (not sure about Safari but I'll check it when I get back home).

Oh. That's not good. Now I wish I'd kept up with plan and set up a redirection page in place of the old search page. Apparently that server is gone for good. It was one of those free tiny hosting deals that ISPs throw in as a bonus. My parents' ISP. This was a long time ago. In the past decade or so, I've never really thought about how long it would stay up. I've just occasionally connected through FTP without thinking a<br><br>On the bright side, I suppose I'm lucky that this happened <i>after</i> I set up an apparently functional replacement on another server. The new hosting space behind gustaver.se is paid for annually, by me, and so is the domain. This should make it a more reliable solution.<br><br>Anyway, I guess I really have to fix up that site now that I can't as easily get away with calling it an open test.

For those who are also interested in its NWN2 counterparts, they can be found at<br><a href="http://www.gustaver.se/nwn2_20/" target="_blank">http://www.gustaver.se/nwn2_20/</a> (level 20 builds) and<br><a href="http://www.gustaver.se/nwn2_30/" target="_blank">http://www.gustaver.se/nwn2_30/</a> (level 30 builds).<br><br>I'd be grateful if you help spread the word where you know there are links to the old address that people still (try to) use. I'm not really in touch with the NWN community these days, and will also be leaving internet access behind for about a week starting Thursday.<br><br>Sorry about the mess.<br><br>ps. (edit) I'll see about the IE thing. Sometimes it's very difficult to like Microsoft.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By pulse cap on 06/15/09 17:01</span></i></p>

If you try to search for anything but 1-3 classes, it doesn't seem to work.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Magical Master on 06/20/09 00:27</span></i></p>

The <a href="http://www.gustaver.se/nwn/" target="_blank">search engine</a> works fine for me. I suggest checking your browser setting (or to do away with IE, but the latter is a more general suggestion <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  )<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

Is the search engine working OK for folk? It seems to not be showing a few of the drop down items and the search button for the last few days for me. I did just "update" Java so am wondering if that is causing an issue?<br><br>Anyone else having problems?<br><br>Link: <a href="http://www.gustaver.se/nwn/" target="_blank">http://www.gustaver.se/nwn/</a>
