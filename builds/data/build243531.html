This is a melee build that is specialized in surviving the worst situations and countering them. <b>It is usable in PvP and medmagic to highmagic PvM.</b><br><br>"One has only seen little of life, if

High fort (Thanks to feats and con) + High HP: You cannot be taken down that fast.<br>Bane of Enemies against all non-shifter player races.<br>High Fort (With items only): Don't fear from Dev Crit or

you stealth<br>Perfect in high-end and equipped only: This build works in PvP well at high-end (30+) only and given equipment.<br>Low Reflex and Will: You are prone to traps and mind-affecting

A few things. Don't include skillpoints in the leveling schematics. It messes the readability. I edited it out this time. Include Class+levels in title. don't give information about specific servers in the build, we want naked or self-attained stats. Only type the class you advance in each level. I have edited a few of those things for you, but please do it yourself next time. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>If you feel the need to include info on how you get on this and that PW then add a post, don't do it in your build. You can however tell us how he looks in say a +5 setting, just do it after the naked stats.<br><br>I don't say these things to be rough on you, it's just friendly advice. Please continue to post, just more orderly. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Hello, Kannte - or, should I say, Guten Nacht <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>I can't speak on behalf of everyone here, but please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tyr (as in Deborah Tyr), and I'm a recent initiate to this wonderful guild myself; having posted here for less than 3 weeks, and I wish to share with you just the following to spare you some, well, growing pains <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Folks here want just the bare and naked stats, followed by (in a separte line) what it is that your character can do as a result of the buffs you've built in to it, and not accounting for any equipemnt, scrolls, etc. whatsoever; these are important. It's good, in a separate post (ie. at the end of your build) to put other considerations in (such as, for instance, what the character may look like in non-uber gear (ie., less than +5, especially since in low magic worlds +3 may be considered pushing it). These things are in gereral most welcome, and with which I'm sure everyone will agree with me when I say that that's good stuff. However, the bare naked stats, and what your character can do as a result of the buffs included in the build are what is important. Please by all means, once again, at the end, include the other stuff: that's just great stuff, but it is extra information <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>As for me, I absolutely love the effective use of quotes; very well done (I congratulate you on that); many here like stories, though not everyone adds em. As such, that would seem to be your choice; but I totally agree that, when quotes are effectively used, they alone can represent a good story <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>Willkommen to the guild, from a new member, too. <br><br>Tyr<br><br>ps. most important piece of advice that I can give you, listen to these folks, this guild adds such amazing polish to your builds, it's just wonderful. Their eyes are fresh, and their suggestions are completely unbiased. And finally, have fun. That's what it's all about! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Robert Tyr on 06/11/06 06:01</span></i></p>

Nice build.  I was just toying with a PVP ranger concept myself.  Too bad about the lowish AC and other saves (besides fort).  Have you gotten him to level 40 on BoW?

listen is a waste because you dont get keen senses.As for the 12 cha , the spot /listen buffs wont last really long and sneakers would outrun you. You should go with 28ranger ,put more pts into  str (prolly 18) ,you need every single point ab you can get. And on BoW you can use the gloves of all seeing , its the same like using 4 bard lvls.
