**edit** moved from the Epic Character Builds Forum, err... that was a dumb place for this post <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    <br><br><br>The subject of build requests occurred to me when I tried to modify one of the builds here and as usual, the feats give me all kind of trouble, I can't figure out why some feats were chosen and why wouldn't it be better to get exotic weapon proficiency instead of luck of heroes..stuff like that and do I thought I could either ask for a lengthy tutorial on building characters or I couold just ask for the build to be modified for the end result I am trying to achieve. The quicker option is number 2 so here it is:<br><br>The Battle Cleric with all wpn proficiencies, no wpn. specific feats and who also kicks major arse would you then just go full Cleric and get more spell power, rely on divine power/favor, battletide, etc. for battles? CG or CN for alignment, prefer CN =8)<br><br><br>also I'm wondering if there should be some kind of policy for build requests? any ideas?<br><br>I have two of these guys currently in play <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    mainly because I want to see him epic and the server he started on hasn't gone to HotU yet <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   <br><br>My first PW character: started out fighter 20, vault wipe happened, remade as 15 fighter/5 cleric becasue of an RP religious experience, then rerolled as 5 fighter/15 cleric, Strength, War Domains, Improved Knockdown, no spell feats becasue I didn't know how useful they were and he's been 20th for a loooong time. Just basically puts on long-term buffs, divine power and/or divine favour before fights, some healing, etc. Plan to take extend spell and empower spell as soon as possible if and when he goes epic.<br><br>the HotU version on another server:<br><br>pure cleric, strength/air domains (currently lvl.19, would kick the original's arse <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   )<br><br>has extend spell, empower spell, works basically the same, just better <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   <br><br>both of these guys have crappy CHA so I'm thinking of making a third Battle Cleric chracter, with some CoT levels to take advantage of Divine Might and Divine Shield feats, among other things. I don't want any paladin levels tho...I can't play LG.<br><br>Also, the drow mage-assassin, not nessarily using the assassin class, but what a mage who was also an assassin would look like in NWN. If anybody has read Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen series, it's the Tiste Andii I'm thinking of: immortal mage-assassins with heavy crossbows and very powerful in magic.<br><br>how about the non-evil assassin in general? the DnD alignment system has always been terrible IMHO. I guess a fighter/rogue/SD would make for an effective Neutral, or even Good, Assassin character. And I guess just about any mage past a certain level of power would have all the abilities needed to do assassin-type stuff..any specific ideas? <br><br>Edited By billb0 on 03/26/04 18:25:44<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By billb0 on 03/27/04 15:29</span></i></p>

Hi all,<br><br>        I wanted to request a Conan the barbarian build. I'd like it based off the books / comic books. He was a rogue at first when he was young plus a barbarian. I'd say rogue first level for more skill points then barb for a few levels then maybe another rogue level using saved skill points to maximize rogue skills. I like to limit the rogue to just a few levels especially pre epic. I'd like to major in barb levels and maybe add a few fighter for weapon specialization / epic weapon specialization. Please any help fleshing this out would be greatly appreciated!!<br><br><br>                                    Thanks, Mano

If you're more interested in the movie version or something then I guess this won't apply <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   Anyway, he worked as a thief for a brief stint and did sneak around on occasion but he was not a rogue, that is, he wasn't really good at being a thief. He was a head and a half taller than nearly everyone, and was an obvious barbarian besides.  I would say that based on the books, Conan is more like a Barb/Fighter, fighter because he does take formal training and ends up using heavy armor,etc. I think someone posted on the excellent builds thread that Conan never used anything but his bastard sword or something and while that may be true for the movie Conan, he becomes proficient with a wide variety of weapons in the books, he even learns to shoot a bow from horseback <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   I dunno about a third class. Oh , and he HATED magic..if anybody knows the AD&amp;D book from back when dinosaurs ruled the earth and TSR still owned DnD, the barabarian class in the book called Unearthed Arcana was a class inspired by Conan <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    Double DEX bonus to AC, double CON bonus to HP, all kinds of special rogue-like abilities and wilderness skills, anyway, lots of stuff. It was cool. I think there are a couple Barbarian builds in the index that might be close..the thundering barbarian comes to mind for some reason..**edit** ok, just looked at the Thundering Barbarian build by Lockindal, that's a build that looks exactly like Conan should be IMHO, and he did it by accident too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Anyway, that's my take on Conan <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   just my opinion, ignore it entirely if you want <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By billb0 on 03/30/04 15:34</span></i></p>

Hi billb0,<br><br>          I agree with most of what you say. I've got about 40 conan books if not more all the original paperback books printed by Ace and with all of Robert Howards original stories. I have a bunch of the Tor printed books as well. I agree that he wasn't much of a rogue. That's why I was looking to limit rogue to probably two levels and three at most. I definitely agree with you about Conan being proficient in a bunch of weapons and skills. That's probably alot of the problems I have trying to build him as he was such a master of everything. That's why within NWN limits I have basically settled on the Barb/Rogue/fighter. I've had a hard time fleshing the build out to do Conan Justice lol. Also I'm one of those older than dirt guys who played pnp D&amp;D lol. I had one of those barb class characters and thought he was the best thing since sliced bread at the time that class came out. I'm not older than dirt just as old as dirt lol (33 y/o). Thanks for the response and if you can give it a shot at trying to build Conan. I'd love to see what you'd come up with. BTW, I posted a character for download that's a thundering barb on my post about volunteering to host bic files on my website.<br><br>                                 Thanks, Mano <br><br>                                Thanks, Mano

Druid/Monk/Shifter. Monk increases the AC and it would make your build harder to hurt and it increases the HP as well since in druid and shifter class the HP don't increase much. Also when you are shifted in dragon form, the weapons you use are creatures abilities which can be supported by Monk because they have free feats in unarmed attacks. Also you would want to max out the tumble because you would need it because of low HP(you can max it out by storing the points and use all of it when you are on the last monk class in the build). As for the breath attacks, I think that can bypass the immunies that the boss might have, but I am not sure.<br><br>Anyway, hope this gives you some idea of how to make good dragon form...<br><br>Anuis

Yes the shifter/monk would be good.  I have seen a few shifter monk builds, but none are as defensive as I think he could be.<br><br>what about Dwarven/barbarian damage reduction?    A Dragon Wall build would be sweet, if possible.    I'll have to check the shifter faq about kama's xfering.<br><br>I asked one of our PW dm's if any boss had 100% immunity to acid+fire+lightning and he said no, so it might be a go for that <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  . Just have to watch the damage done versus damage taken - the 20-30 points regen total.

Been doing some testing and apparently in a high magic pw with great ac items dragon shapes are pretty sad. As well are the dragon breath weapons. So I will not be trying a dragon based class anytime soon. On the other hand I may be looking at kobold commando/rak builds. Thanks for the advice.<br><br>I haven't tried puff yet, but I shy away from him due to reliance on buffs(have to look closer to determine how much reliance). Seems on my pw, I can't walk 2 steps without being dispelled (exaggerating).

I am curious about the rak build that maximizes ice storm damage. How does it deal withcold immune bosses though?<br><br>What I really am interested in is a Kobold Commando/golem build, for that high magic pw.  Right now I am considering a druid 5/monk (6/10) /  shifter build to maximize the kobold's  weapon.<br><br>note:undead forms can't heal themselves, and that means death in a high epic server.<br><br>(The other humanoid forms can be useful too, for various purposes. I will probably not even take dragon forms)

hmm.. my main character is a 16 SHD and 24 rogue... hmm I was thinking, are the feats a SD gets worth it? with the rogue, the SD does not give many bonuses (Improved evasion?)  so are SD's worth getting Epic? or is one level sufficent? the daze gets resisted alot, epic pet is ok, and with UMD there are scrolls that are better then the concealment bonus... so would there be another way to do it?   I made the char to be one who sneaks ahead and checks for traps and such, but I am not too sure if this build is working for that, any ideas?<br>_________________<br>When the Trickster starts a-walking,<br>He sets the whole world askew...<br>Just when you thing that it's all through,<br>It's just the birth of something new.

Hmm I would like to see an epic character that focuses on using the Two-Bladed Sword. Does anyone know if this has been done yet, or if its viable for a powerful character?<br><br>I would imagine such a char would almost certainly have 7 Weaponmaster Levels. After that, not so sure. Perhaps 9 Ranger to get the Two-Weapon Feats? Although these can be got with Fighter/CoT instead I suppose...<br><br>Any ideas?

In my favorite Mod, I can change alignments.<br><br>  It has been said that 35/-  is the highest dam reduction without alignment shift.  I am interested in a build that would actually increase this, though I don't see how barbarian could do it.<br><br>  I have heard paladin/CoT + BG could be great, using charisma for 2x, I am curious about a build for that.  I am mostly interested in ac, dam reduction, ab, damage . .not so much saves or multiple non-stacking uses of the same thing.

Hello Master Builders,<br><br>I have been playing on the NS4 Beta and have been playing a Dwarf.  I was wondering if anybody could build a kick butt Cleric/DwD.  I was thinking maybe 14 Cleric/ 26 DwD.  It would have to be without Dev Crit as it is not allowed.  I have to admit that I do not have the understanding that you guys have.  I have never played a caster either.  I only get to play NWN for a couple of hours a week so I would like to see a build that is really playable from lvl 1.<br><br>I bet it is pretty much a walk in the park for you guys to toss something like this together and I envy your abilities.<br><br>Thanks in advance,<br><br>Jabu

Greetings,<br><br><br>   Lately I have been testing various Fighter/WM/Rogue builds and always come up with different results.  I am trying to get the highest AB possible and AC possible together with these builds.  My skills should be distributed between Disciple/Tumble/UMD/Open Lock and 4 Intimidate, also focusing in Longsword.   I've heard rumors on the PW I play of straight Str Melee types getting over 70AC after equipment and buffs, but the highest I've gotten is 51.  If someone could help me in this build I would greatly appreciate it.  <br><br>Thanks,<br>Christian<br><br>*Also trying to stay with as little rogue levels as possible.  Have been going 10fi/28wm/2rogue<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ChristianJock007 on 05/13/04 15:37</span></i></p>

Hi, I'm new to the guild and NWN.  I am toying with a character.  I'm thinking of a fighter/rogue/Shadow Dancer (10/10/20 or 20/10/10).  I went with the recomended stats for a Human Rogue when I first started.  I think I may have messed the character up.  I'm posting from work, so I can't give you stats at the moment.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I am not sure how they do this on the server I play on, all I know is that this build is able to kick everyone across the table.<br>For some odd reason they say every 2 dex they get an additional 2ab and 2ac.

I have been trying to use a ranger in a competitive PvP enviroment for quite some time and my latest build idea was to try and combine a healthy bane of enemies w/ self concealment for defense.  The server I have been playing has true seeing nerfed vs concealment and HIPS and just regular sneaking around I believe it uses a DC of caster level vs skill level and is basicly just a long lasting amplify or clair-audiance/voyance.  I could be wrong though I never live long enough to find out hehe.  Anyway if you guys could help mne out I would much appreciate it.

Hi guys,<br><br>I havent played in like 2+ years, yet i lost the battle vs. addiction. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>I would like to make a <b>Pure fist-using Dex-monk for PvP use </b>.

He kind of combined the qualities of a stealth based Monk with power of a typical Fighter/Monk multiclass. He could hide in plain sight, get really good AC and epic dodge, and still pack a punch with 6 attacks per round.<br><br>He took Epic Weapon Specialisation to make up for the lack of damage caused by low Strength and some Improved Spell Resistance feats to get him up to 46 SR, which was good enough to stop most multiclassed casters. But the best thing about him was that with the Blinding Speed feat and all his Monk Speed, even whiule he was in stealth mode he still moved faster than a lot of other characters I've played!</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/14/04 12:31:04 (GMT) by ManOWarr<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/13/04 21:16:31 (GMT) by TeH-Blackguard<br><br>Hi lately I've been really interested with monks and would like to know from any of the good monk players on here, if they can help me make a good fist monk...

Hi Everybody!<br><br>I'm going to be creating a vampire priest PC on the server I play on soon and I was wondering how to go about it.<br><br>I've had an extensive look in the Epic builds but still haven't found what I'd like. The closest build would be Kevan Best's "Bane of Life".<br><br>I like the cleric and BG combo but would rather not have the assassin in there.<br><br>Any tips?<br>_________________<br>I make it a personal rule not to argue with idiots.

was thinking of a rogue/dwarven defender.<br><br>you get some nice rogue stuff,ie. imp evasion sneak attack, skills. plus you can get nice damage reduction.<br>something in the area of 12-15 rogue and the rest dd.  get ten rogue first to get base attack up high enough to take dd.  then only take a rogue only a few times to keep skills updated so that you can make it more playable.  also could be make a dexer or str based  which ever suits you.  but i think the str based would give you more feats to play with.<br><br>dont know if this has been done before but.  i know you experts coudl tweak it so it would work nicely.

1/2 the fun of NWN is trying to make a build and have it work. You guys need to test builds first, come to the site, post your build, then ask if anyone has any ideas how to make it better. That'll save a lot of time as opposed to having the mods look for builds that you request..I dunno thats just my honest opinion.

Therefore, this is a call to arms to build the best fighter/weapon master. Heres the rules.<br><br>- The character needs to duel wield bastard swords<br>- He should have all the important WM feats, including dev. critical.<br>- High STR, but decent HP as well.<br>- He must be a feasible campaign character.<br>- Must be a legal character<br><br>Thats all I can think of at the moment, and I intend to post what Ive done with the character for comparison.

Hi all,<br><br>I'm looking for a Paladin/Sorcerer build. The build should be able to cast 4th level Paladin spells and 9th level Sorcerer spells (possibly epic spells). Auto Still III will probably be a must have feat. I'm thinking maybe 17 Paladin/22 Sorcerer/1 of something else? Or 18 Paladin/22 Sorcerer. I'm trying to stay away from any DD levels. I'm sure there has to be a powerful build out there somewhere similar to this who can cast spells with a respectable DC and also dish out some damage with his Holy Avenger. Any ideas?<br><br>Thanks

there is one build I have seen quite a bit online... its a monk/cleric/ranger.. 1/9/30 or something of the like... any one know this build? it seemed to hold up very well in PVP and they dual weilded Kamas (also one had around 800hp).. although I do not know if they exploited at all<br><br>I have been trying to make a monk/cleric/melee class combo, because I feel that it would be very efficient in PVP combat..

It's a pretty nice little mix with assassin levels. It'll be called my shaper of death build. I need to tweak some levels a bit, but it's very fun so far. It isn't a dragon build though. It is a shifter that uses the various humanoid shapes including minitaur and undeads and outsiders with assassin abilities. <br>          <br>        *        *         *         *           *<br><br>evo_dragon <br><br>Joined: 26 Nov 2003 Profile: Thursday, 19 August 2004 08:36AM <br>Please make build request in the general discussion form under the thread "build requests".

Hello folks.  I'm trying to piece together a sneaky barbarian/bard/xx combo.  I'd like to do a dex based character with maybe a little bit of assassin or sd thrown in.  I think the assassin could work for a little bit of sneak.  I really like the idea the HIPS raging barbarian.  If not the greatest builder so any advice would be great.  Thanks in advance. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

I sated my earlier need for a sneaker with the "Moveable Wall" build, but I want to try a kind of "powerhouse" melee character using a Scythe or a Greatsword or another two-handed weapon, focusing on dishing out a lot of damage without becoming vulnerable to total annihilation in return. Maybe a Bard/RDD/WM or something, but I'm pretty much open to anything. I'd really like to try a character like that, so any help would be appreciated.

First of all, thank you very much for allowing me to join the guild!<br><br>Now .. I am hoping someone can help me with a build here.  Have seen and searched for various Monk/Cleric combos (and there are definitely a few out there).  Haven't seen very many Monk/WM/Cleric ones though.<br><br>Was looking at something mostly Monk .. perhaps along the lines of Monk 20/WM 7/Cleric 13 .. or something such as that.<br><br>Has anyone actually run a character like this or have a definite build of a character such as this?  Would love to see it done correctly (as I am a somewhat new at epic character builds).<br><br>Would be levelling on a PW that doesn't allow devestating crit..<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Joe C.

Highest base damage build you're going to get will be something like a Bard/Fighter/RDD.  I'd probably go Dwarven to boost Con, and make your lvls something like Bard 16/Fighter 14/RDD 10.  If you want a higher AC build and don't mind sacrificing a little damage, try Bard 14/PM 16/RDD 10.  Not only does this build get high Str and a nice AC, you even have the potential to get up to 3 Epic Spells, and if that's not good enough, you're immune to crits as well.  <br><br>As for the Monk/Cleric/WM build, I remember one a while back that was Monk 6/Cleric 15/WM 19.  You could take more Monk lvls, but then you're sacrificing AB as well as bonus feats from WM, so you have to ask yourself if it's worth it.  <br><br>One of the disadvantages of a Monk/Cleric/WM build is that since you don't get Uncannny Dodge, you lose your Dex bonus to AC every time you get flanked.  Not only that, but it costs a lot of feats in order to take WM in the first place, most of which probably aren't worth taking.  If you do decide to take WM, make sure to take enough WM levels so that you really get a benefit out of it.<br><br>As an alternative, you might consider Fighter or Rogue.  Taking Fighter lvls will still give you a decent AB as well as a lot more feats.  If you go Rogue, you're AB won't be quite as good, but you get Uncanny Dodge, you can do more damage with sneak attacks, you get more skill credits, and you have the potential to get Epic Dodge and Crippling Strike.

Hey CC, lots of good stuff there, thanks!<br><br>Just trying to digest some of the info there..didn't know the Bard/Fighter/RDD would be so potent -- early in the game played Bards and really didn't find them all that impressive.  Well, check that .. not that they were useless or anything, just seemed like other classes were better (at least when I was running alone).<br><br>You're right about the feats for WM .. takes quite a bit of time to get them and then once you do, they're not all that great (just that you need them to become a WM).  Just that when you do, you can get potential for extra crits (would be using dual Kamas on this char in this PW).  Possibly more feats with Fighter, but thought the extra crits w/ WM might be worth the tradeoff.<br><br>Rogue (or maybe Assassin?) is a definite possibility tho.  Like the sneak attacks, uncanny dodge, crippling strike, etc.  Think it might go well w/ a monk (and cleric with improved invisibility).  Only trouble is, thought I'd concentrate on STR/WIS instead of DEX, so Rogue might not be what I should go for..<br><br>Hmm...decisions, decisions...<br><br>Joe C.

I've made a 14 bard/10 RDD/ 16 PM on the server that I play on and it's pretty much unstopable. I've managed to get the DC on my Dev Crit up to 47 with a crit range of 12-20 so anyone that isn't at least 10 lvls of PM is dead in a few hits. I play on a light magic server and I can get my AC up to 79 so very few people hit me.<br><br>The only trouble that I encounter are casters but they even die. Most of the time when they try to cast bigbys on me they don't land. I'm not sure why this is the case. My SR is only 10 and thats because of an item. Plus usually the silence spell that I cast on myself disables them from casting.<br><br>The only class that gives me trouble is a pure caster with 10 lvls of PM. With all their shields up i.e. Death Armor, Elemental Shield, and Mestil's Acid Sheath I end up killing myself. Although this can easily be fixed with a few rods of dispelling that I carry.

Thanks for the input, highlife.<br><br>Could u possibly write out the level progression of this sort of character?<br><br>Btw, I took a Monk 20/WM 7/Cleric 13 build to that module that helps you train (Halls of Training deluxe, I think...excellent mod), and was fairly satisified w/ the char.  Took Kamas (and used improved crit on them, as well as the weapon of choice for WM) and really enjoyed the multiple attacks w/ them.  Only thing I messed up on is not getting his strength up enough for Overwhelming Critical.  Will have to redo it..<br><br>Though still I wonder how well he'd survive on that PW against epic boss types.  I mean there is one that has a really high AB and can dish out 150HP/round easily.  So basically was going to go one of two ways...excellent AC/DR or go mucho offensive.  Would be nice to combine the two tho. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I looked at that Epic Builders char that uses a Scythe...definitely is tempting to run w/ that sort of critical damage.  Though I've never seen a good scythe in that PW that I'm on...<br><br>So anyway, was now looking at trying some sort of Fighter/WM/Palemaster or some other type of good build that can dish out damage and also be fairly good defensively too...<br><br>Thank ye,<br><br>Joe C.

I believe I have a pretty good idea here. A bard/CoT/ and another class as well RDD would work but I do not like the class and its not what I'm looking for . I believe this build would be quite versatile because it has bard and Cot. It should be for soloing or in small groups preferably. I would build it my self but school keeps me so busy. I would appreciate it if someone found a build like this for me or built it themselves.<br>Thanks<br>CS

I would appreciate it if someone found a build like this for me or built it themselves.<br>Thanks<br>CS</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>That's easy, try this:<br><br><br>Singing Saint<br><br>Bard 16/Cleric 16/Champion of Torm 8<br>(pre-epic Bard 8/Cleric 8/CoT 4)<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Domains: Strength and Healing<br><br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting: <br><br>Str 14<br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 14<br>Wis 14<br>Cha 14<br><br>Put 4 points into Wis, and the rest into Str<br><br>Ending:<br><br>Str 26 <br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 14<br>Wis 18<br>Cha 14<br><br>Feats<br><br>1 Power Attack, Cleave<br>3 Extend Spell<br>6 Still Spell<br>9 Toughness<br>12 Weapon Focus CoT: Knockdown OR Disarm<br>15 Imp.

I think it loses 1 point of AB and a couple points of damage due to the lower Str (also no immunities), but it gets better saves and more feats, so it's a pretty reasonable build.  Give it a shot, let me know what you think.

You all have definitely given me some ideas here.  Have run thru some of them on the Epic to Novice training mod.<br><br>Could someone do the 14 bard/10 RDD/16PM build for me?  Would love to compare that one with some of the others.<br><br>Right now (though as fickle as my mind is it could change!) I'd like to go with either that one, or the "Avenging Angel" build (believe it is a Fighter/RDD/Sorc build) or the Undead Lord on the Epic Builders page (though with my experimentation, took out the Auto Still and put some other epic feats in).<br><br>That one seemed to do OK, but seemingly had more trouble hitting (even with True Strike) for some odd reason.  Then again, ancient dragons may give a lot of characters problems. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>See, right now on my PW I run alone a lot of the time (mostly do the freaky hours I can get on and play) and would like a char that is good at dishing out lots o' damage, as well as can sit there and either take lot of damage or not get hit (or have DR or both).  I mean, there is this giant there that no spells (other than Blade Barrier anyway) can get thru his SR.  Harm goes doink.  As well as most other power spells.  And when I fight him (right now have a Fighter/Cleric build) he hits me everytime for like 150 points of damage.  OW. <br><br>Then again, my AC on that guy is only like 34 and I'm sure that nasty giant has a big attack #.<br><br>Any ideas?  Thanks!<br><br>Joe C.

Great stuff, evo_dragon.  Thanks!  Will give both builds some testing later on when/if I have some time here.<br><br>One question.  I saw on your STR build one that you took Heavy Armor.  Now when you get the Epic Mage Armor, does that add to heavy armor, or do you basically have to be out of armor for that to work?  Because I thought Mage Armor itself doesn't add to deflection modifiers (like magic armor)..or so I thought anywho...<br><br>Thanks again!<br><br>Joe C.

Epic Mage Armor gives you +20 to AC: +5 to 4 different AC modifiers.  It doesn't matter what kind of armor you're wearing as to the effect of Epic Mage armor.  What matters is the <b>magical</b> bonuses you get from the armor.  <br><br>For example, if you had mundane plate armor, then you would get a +5 armor bonus from Epic Mage Armor.  If you had +3 plate armor, you now only get a +2 bonus from Epic Mage Armor, so that your armor AC is brought up to +5.  If you have +5 or higher armor AC, Epic Mage armor will add nothing for armor, but it may still add AC for the other types of AC modifiers.<br><br>To my knowledge, the only type of AC bonus that stacks with magical AC bonuses you have on your character is Dodge AC, provided you haven't already reached the +20 max for Dodge AC.  Thus, if you had a character with +5 to all AC modifiers from magical equipment, you would still get +5 to AC from Epic Mage Armor.

Hello all,<br>I play on a low magic server so +5 to +6 is the cap for magic items. Since this is the case casters can easily dominate there, specifically builds such as bioware's exalted sorceress or builds similiar to that. A lot of builds go 38 sorc/1 pally/ and then either 1 rogue or 1 monk. The only way I can beat them is if they happen to roll a 1 against my Dev Crit within the first few rounds. Usually the case happens that I end up either dying from their shields or the spells they pummel me with.<br><br>With this said I'm looking for a build that can stand up to this heavy caster. Now the options that I have considered are a rakshasa shifter, a monk, or a heavy caster.<br><br>The rakshasa shifter would easily be able to take a caster but any dev critter with clerical buffs would easily be able to get a few whacks in and send me packing. The monk would be a good choice but may have the same problem as the shifter.<br><br>The safest all around bet would probably be a 38 sorc/1 pally/1 monk or 1 rogue. Fight fire with fire I guess. The fight would just be who can keep their spell mantles up.<br><br>Would you guys mind giving me your input and maybe any builds I may have overlooked.<br>Thanks

Crit., I can tell this is not the case, or at least it shouldn't be.  The reason is that you're a shifter; you use your different shapes to adapt to different situations.  Use Rakshasa to school arcane casters, and then when someone tries to melee you, shift into either Construct or Undead form and let their silly selves just TRY to hurt you.  <br><br>Seriously, with SBully's build I think you get around 23 caster levels, which means that your reciprocal damage spells are going to HURT, and with the DR from Iron Golem form or the damage immunity from Risen Lord form, your opponent will probably be taking more damage than you will.  <br><br>A couple things I didn't see you mention were Cleric or Paladin builds.  You may not be aware, but a Paladin with a Holy Avenger can dispel the buffs of even a lvl 40 caster, as there is NO DC on the dispel, at least that I'm aware of.  Thus, if you had a Paladin/Cleric or something like that with Silent spell (or Auto-Silent if you really want it), you should be able to cause some trouble for arcane casters.  <br><br>You might consider something like a Rogue 10/Paladin 15/Cleric 15.  You can get decent saving throws, a high AB, a decent AC, and decent damage with 5d6 sneak attacks + your Cleric buffs.  You may also want to consider putting some points into Set and Craft Traps, as it seems like most characters don't bother to look for traps in PvP.  Of course, traps are most useful if you have stealth, but it's not strictly necessary.  Take Trickery domain for Improved Invis, and probably Healing as well for Empowered cures.  If you take Craft Wand, you should be able to create wands of Cure Critical wounds, which could be quite helpful in PvP.

I'll have to check out Sbullys but as far as the shifter goes, I haven't seen any builds that excell in any other form besides rakshasa. Most of the Undead/construct shapes have low ab and low ac. So while they give you good DR and damage immunities basically you won't be able to hit any good character. You just end up being a wacking pole. Now a rakshasa that can achieve a high AC is a good choice because you can spam off enough ice storms before a melee lands enough hits to do you in.<br><br>As far as the cleric/paladin build you suggested I doubt that will work. Bigby's crushing hand or bigby's grasping hand makes this char easy pickings. The only thing that prevents those spells is spell immunity, spell resistance, or a very high AC. An approximate AC 79 is required to fend off bigsby hands by a lvl 38 caster and that combo of build cannot achieve such a high AC.

Six levels of Fighter will give you 4 bonus feats, 2 of which can be spent to get Epic Weapon Spec, which will give you +6 damage to every attack with that weapon.  I suppose Monk will give you a higher Naked AC, and if that's what you're going for then 2 levels should be OK.  <br><br>If you take Monk to lvl 6, however, you get IKD for "free", as well as +1 to your AC.  BTW I probably wouldn't dual-wield Scimitars as this will give you -4 to your AB.  If you take Exotic Weapon Prof.  rather than Martial, you can use Kukris, which have the same threat range as a Scimitar but which are considered light weapons, so that you only suffer a   -2 penalty. <br><br>(quote)Posted 10/22/04 00:46:38 (GMT) -- highlife262626<br><br>I'll have to check out Sbullys but as far as the shifter goes, I haven't seen any builds that excell in any other form besides rakshasa.

If you'd prefer to stay in Rakshasa form and hit them with ice storms that's fine, but remember that Rakshasa's aren't crit immune like the other forms, so a character with Dev Crit may be able to take you out pretty easily.  <br><br>As for the Rogue/Paladin/Cleric build, you can get an AC of 28 with no spells or items.  With +5 items, you should be able to get your AC up to 53.  With spells, you should be able to buff it a bit higher, particularly if you take the Plant domain, as that will give you access to Barkskin.  Of course, this is assuming you're going Str-based; if you go Dex-based you should be able to get it a bit higher.  <br><br>The point of the build is to buff yourself up while still in Greater Sanctuary, cast Silence on yourself, and then enter melee.  Your opponent won't be able to target you until you start attacking, at which point he or she will be within the radius of your Silence spell.  Of course, some casters, particularly Sorcs, may be able to cast even while silenced, through the miracle of Silent Spell and Spontaneous casting.  <br><br>Of course, if they're using Silent Spell rather than Auto-Silent, they won't be able to cast 9th lvl spells, so that means no Maximized IGMS, no Mord's, and no Bigby's Crushing Hand.  They may still be able to hit you with the Grasping Hand, however, so you do have to be careful. <br><br>For those, you use IKD.  You can get your AB reasonably  high (~65) with your Cleric buffs, which means that it's going to be difficult for them to resist getting knocked down.  If they take Monk or Paladin as their last lvl, they should be able to get 43 ranks in Disc.  With skill focus and Epic skill focus (I think most casters just take Epic), they can get another 13 points, for a total of 56.  The modifier for Disc is Strength, which tends to be quite low for most arcane casters, although they can wear items to buff it.  <br><br>Thus, the only way that they will consistently resist your IKD is if they have some serious +Disc items, like Epic gloves of Discipline (+30 I think).  Of course, They may be able to avoid getting hit if they have a stupidly high AC, but if that's the case you were screwed anyway.

Catgirl Gone Wild!<br><br>I have just started playing on the PW, Valley of Shrouds. Its an original content low magic world. The classes have been reworked to encourage balance and cooperative play. Leveling is very slow and party based. Out of the 20+ average player base there are about a couple of diligent characters on at any given time who have reached epic levels. Basicly I am looking to find a build which does not require me to be epic to be useful in a party. <br><br>I am new to NWN and D&amp;D in general. I have gotten the basics of how the game works but cannot for the life of me make a viable character build. Here is what I am looking for:<br><br>Human <br>Druid(RP) <br>Fighter(extra feats) <br>Monk (speed/AC/unarmed)<br><br>I would like to be able to brew and craft wands. Use a longbow effectively without sacraficing unarmed if possible. Please.. No builds that require me to shift to be useful.<br><br>Please PM if you would like to discuss further.<br><br>Thank you in Advance! Shanda

It gets a decent AB and a very nice AC, and of course it gets tons of skill credits and lots of spells per day.  It also gets Epic Dodge, which will be very nice when used in conjunction with Improved Invis.

Here's one that might be interesting.<br><br>For a PW<br>Cleric + Sorc+maybe 3rd class?, casting based, with divine shield at least.  I'll be wearing +12 wis+cha items. and DC isn't too much of an issue, getting epic spells is.  having all the cleric spells would be nice, but not necessary either <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

I'm looking for something on a PW that can take some damage.  I suppose you can call it a "tank" type character.  On this world AC isn't nearly as important (at least in higher level encounters) as Damage Reduction.<br><br>Yes, I know DD's are good in that area.  But that has been done to death on this world (and I'm sure a few others).  Also believe Epic Warding/Mage Armor would be handy to have as well with things there dishing out 100 HP's a swing.<br><br>Was thinking about a few possibilities.  Perhaps something Barbarian related?  Like a Barbarian/Bard/RDD?  <br><br>Or more spellcasting perhaps like a Fighter/Wiz/PM? (something like 10/14/16 or 10/20/10 level wise)?<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Joe C.

hey, im looking for a build that can tank monsters with +100 ab. being able to hit stuff is not a requirement. I was thinking along the lines of a monk wizard druid, and was wondering if a dragon shaped druid is immune to criticals?

Hiya everybody.  I reccon I posted this in the wrong place; can someone advise?<br>Looking to build something similar to the Monk25/wiz5/PM10 build; but with more focus on mage levels [sorc or wiz; pref wiz if PM route is taken as scrolls would be needed]. Basically the Monk levels should be added as a melee-enabling enhancer; making it a kind of spellsword with monk capabilities [speed/attacks/etc]. As there are no good armor items available; Epic Mage Armor is a must; as is Epic Warding and any buffs possible like ShadowShield and Grtr StoneSkin. The character should be able to buff their weapons early on as there are very few decent (read: anything +1 or better) kama's available that he can get while still standing. Equipment is not guaranteed; however minor items like +1 soak 5 robes are readily available; as is a few basic weapons.<br>Dev Crit is disabled <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> .<br>Any advice would be sorely appreciated.

With wizard 5 and pm 10, you'll have a caster of level 10, with an effective caster level of 5. You'll only have access to level 5 spells, thus only stoneskin, with a duration of 5 hours (about 10 minutes) and 50 DR of absorption.

You seem to want the AC and AB from the monk, the AC and immunities from the PM, and the spellcasting abilities, including epic, from the wizard. You're going straight into a wall. A character cannot excell in more than one thing, and requires a dedicated build to be good at two.<br>What you seem to want is a self-buffing tank with defensive and offensive melee capabilities. On a low magic world, a Monk 25 / Wizard 5 / PM 10 should be enough. On another world, I doubt a build matching your heavy requirements will exist, at least without the PRC, and maybe even with it.<br>_________________<br>If you call IGMS, Harm, Mestil's acid shield, the Bigby hands or Devastating Critical balanced in your post, don't expect me to like you.<br><br>I'm sorry about my bad english, I'm french.<br>In every lie lies a part of truth.

Giving classes and avarage levels isn't generally enough. You have to understand your own priorities (offensive or defensive melee presence, magic buffing, heavy offensive spellcasting, dual-wielding, etc ...) and then, people will help you much easier, and you will even help yourself.<br>I do greatly enjoy planning a build, sometimes i even enjoy it more than playing it. But i do because i know what i want, i know what i will have to give up for it, and i know the overall picture of my build even before i start building it. I generally sacrifice the defensive side of my characters, both melee and magic, for a much better mastery of offensive, either by magic means or by weaponry. The results are some nice characters, fun to play and efficient, but need carefulness to be played, because they can die as fast as they can kill.<br>_________________<br>If you call IGMS, Harm, Mestil's acid shield, the Bigby hands or Devastating Critical balanced in your post, don't expect me to like you.<br><br>I'm sorry about my bad english, I'm french.<br>In every lie lies a part of truth.

I'm looking for a build that focuses in the kukri. The build must have cleric and Champion of Torm. The reasons being that battletide, divine favor, and CoT's divine wrath give magical and divine damage that can not be resisted on the low magic server I play on. Also CoT insures that my savings throws will be boosted so that Dev Crit doesn't become such a big problem. I would like a high Charisma so that the Divine Wrath can last as long as it can.<br><br>Sounds like a Charisma based character would do good here but I don't have much experience making that type. For the third class I was thinking either Weapon Master or Paladin.

Alrighty; me again.. hopefully this is more workable..<br><br>What I'm trying to figure out; is a high-ac character that can dish out a bit of pain (either casting or melee).  Would be preferable if they can self-buff.<br><br>Some of the obstacles he'll face include boss's with TrueSight (amost all of them), critters at the top end hitting with around 100hp per hit and various elemental damage - mostly fire and electricity.  Dev Crit is disabled, and monk-based shifting toons are a bit nerfed.  From the enhancement point of view, most weapons are best utilised dual-wielding, since they typically have extra attribute modifiers applied that end up enhancing ab more than single-wielding [or so I have seen in the stats dialog when switching].  Hope this is enough data for working on, and hopefully someone can think of something.<br><br>PS:  on autostill, there is plate armor available that negates arcane failure.

Hello!<br>I have been trying to construct a fighter/rogue build that has the following abilities and feats: epic dodge, SC V, ambidex, two wep fighting, imp two wep fighting, exotic wep, wep focus kukri, wep finesse, wep spec and epic wep spec, knockdown and imp knockdown. I cannot get it to work though. Any suggestions? I dont mind adding a third class, I tried a CoT since they have many feats but that didnt help. I dont want more than 4 fighter levels and as many rogue levels as possible and if possible a good level split at level 20.<br>If anyone can do this I would be happy.

Any have a nice build for an drow 30 Sorc/10 RDD...can only find some with a third class in the build..maybe with use of longsword as elves gets that free. (but is there any "staff items" which can be used in secondary hand?<br><br>If I would want to have use of a weapon, would the builds with a third class (paladin/monk/fighter) be better??<br><br>I looked abit on the sorc29/rdd10/pal1, would you be able to change it to a sorc29/rdd10/bg1...if you dont want to be lawfull. Or would bg not give the same abilities as a paladin? If this is already made, any have a link for it?<br><br>Thanks for your time.

I play on a server where Dev Crit is disabled, and getting to 40 for me is fairly easy.<br>With that in mind I was curious what builds would be most useful at the "epic" level..where most monsters will hit at least their first 2 attacks vs any 60 or lower ac builds that I have made.<br><br>I have thought about Monk / Druid / SD possibly for a strong dragon and druid casting with monk ac from wis?<br><br>Maybe DwD / WM / ?? I dont know what to put with those 2 =).<br><br>I have tried the Rogue 13 / ranger 21 / Fighter 6....and it just doesnt tank very well at all...even with the epic dodge.<br>I also tried Bard 2 /Fighter 16 /WM 22 and the same holds true...the tanking just doesnt seem to be there and the low end damage without crits is 50-80 where others are hitting for 100+ with short swords...and im using a scythe =).<br><br>Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Found that a monk/wiz4/PM works very nicely.  Focus on Dex and put decent points into Wis; and some to INT for skills (tumble and discipline focussed).  There is a build like that here: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "164802", "", ".", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>  I managed to get a naked unbuffed ac of over 40 at lvl40 with a few slight variations.  With +12 Dex gear; Wis boost gear; ac boost gear, and epic mage armor with probable epic warding, you have a fairly tough build.

Hello all, can someone please help me with a character build. I am looking for a CHR based TOTALLY LEGITIMATE Paladin/Fighter combination. Totally proficient with greatsword and able to cast all Paladin spell levels. I am going to post my build on the Epic Char forum as well and I ask that anyone really good at char building have a look at it for me and tell me how to improve it.<br>All input is appreciated ... I don't care about devastating critical as much as having 'lay on hands' as high as I can get it.<br>Thanks

Greetings,<br><br>  For the past several days I've been trying to come up with a way to get my AB above 70 with a melee class.  Here is my situation.<br><br><br>The PW I play on has an unbelievable amount of dispelling monsters so having a character that buffs is pretty much useless.<br><br>I know AA's can get AB up in the 80's, but I've never enjoyed playing them.<br><br>The PW also has weapons with +10 enhancements.<br><br><br>So here is my dilemma.<br><br><br>Is it possible to get a non-buffing melee character over 70AB with +10 weapons?  I have done the common 11fi/28wm/2bard-rogue combo countless times but have yet to figure a way to get the AB above 70.<br><br>If anyone has a suggestion to a new type of build (melee based) I would be greatful.   I don't need a level by level progression, only the classes and level of classes.  And perhaps some key points to keep in mind for building it.<br><br><br>Again thanks,<br><br>christian

I'm not sure about a build but here are some options you can consider. The clerical domain war gives you battle mastery which adds a boost to your AB and I believe that it is not dispellable. You could also try Champion of Torm because their ability divine wrath is not dispellable. So with all of this I would make a chrasima based character and get divine might and divine shield becuase I believe those are not dispellable either.

I'd like a shifter that uses the Dragon Shape. <br>I imagine it wouldn't be the stongest build, but I've never done a shifter before, and would like some guidance on building an effective Dragon Shifter (I haven't seen one of these in the Epic Builds forum).<br><br>I assume that I'll want to go Lawful Neutral and start off with a few Monk levels, but I'm fairly clueless about the optimal level distribution. <br><br>Also, does Weapon Focus and Improved Crit. in Unarmed Strike help with the Dragon Attack at all, being that the dragons basically are unarmed?

Christian, you could try an bard 11 rdd 10 weaponmaster 19. <br><br>Get your strength to 38 base with 2 great strength feats, +12 with items (im assuming), so your AB would be: 27 (bab)+ 20(strength)+ 4(feats)+ 4(weaponmaster)+ 10(weapon) =65.<br>If you get bard song, you can get 67.<br><br>Another option might be to try a 22 bard/10 rdd and some other fighter-type class for eight levels pre-epic. If you want to dual wield, perhaps 21 bard/10 rdd/9 ranger.<br>Get lasting impression (or lingering inspiration, or whatever it's called) on bard 21 or 22. Also grab epic mage armor on the other level. Your song now lasts a long time, so between the -6ish ac curse and +3ish ab song for yourself, your ab should look something like:<br>27 bab + 20 (strength) + 4 (feats) + 10 (weapon) +9 (songs): 70 AB.<br>Your ac is going to be nice, also, because you'll get +6ish from song, +4ish from rdd, +5 from epic mage armor, and give your opponents -3ish ab from curse song, for a total of about +18 ac over the average fully armored warrior. (+22 if they dont have 40 tumble). Not bad.<br>You're limited to undispellable buffs, but they last a really really long time (150 rounds, I believe).<br>As far as getting _above_ 70 ab, do the build above with orc, or take 4 great strength feats instead of 2.<br>Maybe try taunt (if it's a class skill.. I'm not really sure, you might have to look for a fighting class with taunt) to effectively boost your AB even higher.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By yrtsns on 03/06/05 16:45</span></i></p>

Hi everyone. I am a brand new member to the guild and am exceedingly greatful to have the opportunity to "pick your collective minds" on character building.<br><br>I have a request please.  I play on a moderate magic PW (no better than +5 items/haste is NOT abundant/devestating critical is disabled/higher level monsters pack a real whallop so AC is definitely a consideration).  As such, I am looking for recommendations for a bard/cleric/rdd build that uses a one-handed weapon and shield instead of the greatsword. I have looked at caulepp's human blade juggernaut but was wondering if the 28cleric/2bard/10rdd build previously mentioned actually does more damage and/or has better AC?  Anyway, any help or advice is greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

No, the Blade Juggernaut (Bard 15/Cleric 15/RDD 10) would get a better AC due to the AC bonus from his 15th lvl Bard Song.  <br><br>Of course, the Bard 2/Cleric 28/RDD 10 build isn't bad either; his buffs are much harder to dispell, he gets a higher SR from the Spell Resistance spell, his buffs last longer, and he's better able to overcome SR.  <br><br>The biggest disadvantage of the second build is that you lose out on all of the Bard's spells, such as Haste and Improved Invis., although it's possible to pick these up as Cleric by taking the Trickery and Travel domains.  <br><br>The weakness of Bard Song/Curse Song (don't take this feat with the 2nd build) hurts a little as well, but you can already buff yourself to +20 AB with the Cleric (which is the cap for boosting your AB), so it's not actually that bad of a loss.

Thanks Crispycritter.  Two things as I am still new to character building.  One, what is the difference between the 15cleric/15bard/10rdd version caulepp posted compared to the 16cleric/14bard/10rdd one? Second, considering I play in a moderate magic world with high creature attacks, what is the max AC I could generate using a one-handed weapon and a shield? To be honest, Ive tried reading thru some posts about AC, and tried self-leveling a char in teh CEP starter mod, but I cant come close to the AC's that these builds talk about.  Im not sure what I am missing.  Thanks...<br><br>Oh, one last thing.  If I am going one-handed, what weapon would you recommend please?
