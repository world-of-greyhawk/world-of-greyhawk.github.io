This has probably been done before, but I've been trying to work out an elementalist build for the server I normally play on.<br><br>Something that uses  stuff like Ice Storm, Fireball and so on...<br><br>Was considering a Sorcerer/AA. Was thinking maybe a Sorc/Cleric/AA?<br><br>Anyways, some facts that you guys may want to know about the server:<br><br>- Dev crit has been disallowed.<br><br>- Alot of spells have been changed<br><br>- AA can only get upto level 10. (Something about Enhancements beating DR issues.)<br><br>- Leveling takes ages. So a character that can dive right into the deep end and hold it's own is rather useful.<br><br>- The highest possible enhancements on weapons is +7 I believe, they are extremely rare though. Most people won't be able to get better than +3. That's for ability boost items as well.<br><br>So then, anything I've missed?<br>_________________<br>Can I have a pet beholder?

What's your idea of an elementalist exactly (mine is a Druid  that shifts into Elemental Shapes <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ), because if what you want is an elemental caster then just take a lot of Sorcerer and done, no idea why you would add Arcane Archer there.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

At the start I was just thinking AA as something new that I haven't done before, as I fiddled around I decided I should keep it as one of those things that I haven't done before to this point. It didn't seem to work with my plans. Oh well.
