i am trying to think of an interesting build to whoop some rogue/assassin buttocks.  i was thinking some sort of monk or ranger where i can bump spot and listen with a useful wis score.  perhaps a divine caster?  i dunno, the more ideas i have, the more limiting it becomes.  just wondering if anyone of our resident rogue-esque-lovers would quickly describe their banes, so that i may seize upon them.  obviously a sneak-immune buld also comes to mind, but i would like more of a melee char with natural (skill-based) rogue-detection.  spells are okay but they wear off.  i want full time.  i suppose an elf is also the way to go, for full time searching.  any ideas, or thoughts i have yet to cover?<br><br>thanks for any and all help.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>Do not meddle in the affairs of Dragons, for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.

thanks fin.  that build isn't bad.  i am trying to figure out something more on the melee side of things.  perhaps something based on a ranger/cleric hybrid.  thanks for the input though.  any more is greatly appreciated.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Perception is strong and sight weak.

10 levels of Pale Master makes you immune to sneak attacks.  Also gives you other nice bonuses like AC.  You don't have to make much use of the caster portions...could use ranger or cleric if you want for the rest of the levels.  Like Ranger(27)/Wizard(3)/PM(10).  Then you'd be able to get your spot and listen all the way up as well, since you still need to see them to hit them.  But just being able to see them won't help against IKD sneak attacks, so the PM levels help there.  Of course if you go cleric instead of ranger, you get True Seeing.  Heck, you could go Rogue instead of ranger just to be cruel.  You can sneak attack them, but they can't sneak attack you.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 09/06/05 21:07</span></i></p>

hm... i like the idea of stravinsky's ranger/wiz/pm...i am seeing some interesting possibilities.  the only problem in taking rogue is that i can't get a higher bab than 25 probably making the need for dual wield even higher.  but perhaps ranger, with BoE, can do alright damage.<br><br>perhaps the healer build with a higher strength is a better route, but again i am faced with the problem of a lower bab.  i hate to melee without 4 attacks per round.  if i took some monk this wouldn't be a problem.  thanks damouse.<br><br>argh!  i just can't seem to find a class mix that seems to fit the bill.<br><br>thanks again for all of the ideas.  please feel free to give me any others.  i appreciate all of them.<br><br>thanks!<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>Do not meddle in the affairs of Dragons, for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By christian.schnabel on 09/07/05 02:53</span></i></p>

For sheer cheeze factor, an elven bard, rdd palemaster could easily get an AC in the 70's and have enough focus in listen to notice the assasin coming, let the guy miss him in melee and strike him down with a devcrit if he was so inclined.

As I understand it, spot and listen checks are performed once per round, so any rogue or assassin with HiPS would still be able to hide from you. So what you really need is true seeing. Perhaps a druid or cleric with zen archery? Depending on the situation, they may try to run away when they notice they can't sneak up on you, so the disabling spells would probably come i handy too. And if you use druid you can eventually get dragon shape which is sneak immune and has permanent true seeing.<br><br>EDIT:<br>Oh you wanted melee, sorry. I wish I'd learn to read <i>the whole thread</i> before posting. A bit of caster for true seeing is probably very good to have however.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By pulse cap on 09/07/05 05:51</span></i></p>

i was considering the bardic route as well, but again without a warrior class you are getting 3 attacks per round.  haste doesn't last long enough to do the job, and even then with haste items other are still getting another attack per round.  but the AC and crit immunity are big factors.  so is the fire immunity (no flame weapon damage from UMD scrolls).<br><br>true seeing seems to last about 5/10ths of a second.  even with high caster levels and extended, it is something that needs to be recast often enough to be annoying.  but this is a good solution to hiding foes.  *RANT* what is the point of only making skill checks once per round if the hiding continues for the whole round?!?  doesn't really seem fair. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   *END RANT*  so then perhaps elves aren't as hot on the spot/listen scene as i thought...<br><br>well, i think that these are all good ideas, but i still can't seem to get a good melee build together.  perhaps it just isn't going to happen.  i suppose that a shifter build, using undead shape, is also a way to go, but that takes a long time.  dang it.  this is turning out to be harder than i thought (which was pretty hard to begin with).<br><br>thanks to Deltutammatre, pulse cap, and all who have done their best to aid me in my plight.  any and all other suggestions ideas, criticisms, rants, or whatever are welcome.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Perception is strong and sight weak.

i think this might be the way to go.  armor, spells, true seeing.  but then again there is a problem with IKD sneaks.  but i suppose that with a high discipline, that shouldn't be a problem.<br>halflings are a guaranteed FE.  as are...dare i say it...dwarves. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Perception is strong and sight weak.

Think I'd choose Bard 4/ Cleric 20/ PaleMaster 16. Sneak immunity, very high ac thanks to the PM levels and the ability to cast in full plate and a shield, very good saves, great buffs all round.

You want to melee against a sneaker, huh? How about Champ of Torm 10 (for feats) Wep Master 8 (7 for abilities +1 at 40 to top off spot as a class skill)and  Cleric 22?  Take knowledge domain for Clairaudience/clairvoiance/true seeing.  Add that plus skill focus and epic skill focus in spot and your wis bonus and you should beat their hide. Also trickery domain for improved invis (so they miss you with their sneak if they get lucky).

Also word of faith then storm of vengence.  Sure they will make their save against the lightning, but slowly die thanks to no save vs acid.  Or dispell them and have fun with their low fort saves using say slay living or destruction.

just a quick update on my progress...<br><br>after some rather disappointing testing, i have found that even with true seeing, and a good discipline score, any more than two chars that can sneak deals devastating damage to a char that is not strong enough to resist it.<br><br>my results pointed me towards a build with high spot and sneak immunity.  this resulted in a number of versions of ranger/wiz/pm that all seemed incredibly underpowered. 3 levels of wiz and 10 levels of pm take away alot from a ranger build, without giving enough arcane punch to make a different.  the defense versus offense bugged me a lot.  increasing the wizard and pm levels resulted in a still pretty weak build, but slightly better in terms of defense.<br><br>also, i have been trying to increase fort to resist a strong paralyzing death attack, but again my results were poor, and could at best only resist weak assassins.<br><br>if anyone has any more advice, i would appreciate it.  otherwise, i will say that a decent anti-assassin melee char is tricky at best, and at worst impossible.<br><br>here are the revised criteria for this build. if anyone thinks they have it solved, please post here or to me privately and let me in on your amazing char mojo. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>sneak immunity<br>40+ AB without spells<br>high ranks in spot (or listen), probably with ESF<br>strong discipline score<br>high-ish fort save (30+ ideally)<br>high-ish AC (high 20's)<br><br>any further ideas or comments are welcome.<br><br>thanks agian to everyone who has posted here any number of times.  your input was much valued.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger."<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By christian.schnabel on 09/11/05 02:58</span></i></p>

His AB can still be quite good, why not? He needs CHA somewhat, but not to much, and then he can bomb STR or DEX, whichever he wants for AB, depending on his preferences. His AB can easily be up close to builds without RDD or WM. So your suggestion is better than you think, that's why you'renamed Queen perhaps. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Grim

Well while I was still thinking on this, I thought something more along the lines of an elven Ranger/CoT with 14 Wis and taking plenty of FEs for their bonus skill checks not just damage and bane, dual-wielding maybe with a two-bladed sword (large weapon?), improved disarm and with dev crit and ESF in either Listen or Spot. CoT gets save bonuses (jack that Fort save up most importantly) and Spot as a class skill. I guess you've got a lot of people thinking and I'm quite new to this (some builds already posted). Even better (if managable) put in some stealth xD. Sneaky-types don't usually have high wisdom scores and don't invest heavily in listen/spot. Use their own tactics against them &gt;:).

Woopsies on the shield but he gets normal Ambi and TWF during the CoT levels which were timed so he'd get them then bonus ITWF from Ranger so he should do fine in medium armor (unless it's bugged and Dual-Wield takes precedence). Yup he can make use of spells/other stat boosters and wear light armor too if the situation requires.

Aren't there a lot of good spellsword builds centered around nuking mages already? That archer build I posted might do OK against wizzies but maxed IGMS is EVIL. Mages look wimpy on paper - I mean 1d4 HP pff die already *bonks with saucepan and gets hit with reciprocal damage and dies x_x* (and I've never played an arcane-caster) but going against that demi-lich in HoTU taught me otherwise. He would NOT die. I died so many times against him but at least his AI isn't great so he didn't rebuff when I dispelled him. I don't even want to think of what a real player could do &gt;.&lt; especially with that omg overpowered epic warding/epic mage armor.<br><br>I wouldn't really know on how to go about an anti-caster. Mages even kill each other fairly easily so what chance does a non-mage who isn't like pure monk have <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">

That was just a bit of tongue-and-cheek, on my part, lassie.  I wasn't actually wanting an anti-caster build.  I was merely defending the honour of the noble assassin class.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Yes very 'noble' =P. I do kinda agree with you though. They're a bit wimpy for a prestige class. A special sneak attack that can only fire off twice a round and 4 skill points per level <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> .

Experience is the best teacher I suppose, so might as well put these so-called anti-assassin builds to a real test.  Let's see what they're made of.

LOL <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>I intended those character builds to be general anti-rogue/things that hide in shadows characters, not to specifically beat The Assassin King.<br><br>Things that hide in shadows tend to wield small, pointy weapons, dual wield, get epic dodge, surprise and backstab to make you die quickly then hide again and a lot get SC V. BTW, I tend to like playing said hide in shadows thingies than brutish tanks. It must be something about standing in the midst of like, 100 fireballs and taking 0 damage xD.<br><br>Anyhow how Cinn can go for me *no experience of PvP in NWN*
