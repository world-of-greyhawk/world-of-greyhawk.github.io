Okay I want a monk build. There are no rules on my server. I just want it to be pretty decent. This is a low magic world and I need Dev Crit to survive. This monk needs to use 2 short swords, one long sword (no shield), or a Dual bladed sword. I have no idea where to go from here.

This build is for the last jedi server, monk speed is good rp. Plus they gain some force moves. Those weapons represent types of lightsabers.

Yeah, give us more info about your server.<br><br>Anyway, is it a heavy monk build then? Monk speed is useful with over 15 levels I think... it's impossible for me to pick your multiclass since it's an rp build. You could take Fighter for Epic Weapon Specialization plus feats, that's always a good one, Dwarven Defender for DR, that's one of my favorites, Weapon Master for critical hits, pretty useful as well, Cleric for buffs, if the environment is +5 or lower Cleric just owns and it's still good on higher, Paladin for goodness, Blessed sword and Holy sword are useful, I think Blessed sword gives damage vs evil and sith opponents (well, I suppose) are evil for sure, and a dispel-on-hit is always good too, Blackguard if you're the sith, fits description and adds some sneak damage plus stacking Bull's Strength...<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Okay force moves just come with character, this are not feats. I can modify the build a bit to the liking if I need too. All I need is a monk that can be pretty decent with the weapons i listed.

Dude, I gave options of classes that might be useful, I was expecting you to pick two of them. I won't go ahead and make a build out of the blue to receive a reply that you don't like my style of build (it happened too many times already, so I'm tired of it), you would do good to tell us what you want, just saying a melee Monk that can use those weapons is absolutely not enough information to make a strong build.<br>_________________<br>Join the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Pre-epic Character Builds</a> Guild for builds capped at level 20 and level 30.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/14/07 02:19</span></i></p>

So, you want to be a monk who's good with 3 kinds of weapons. That will take lots of fightr levels pre-epic. You have to qualify pre-epic for:<br><br>Devcrit: 6<br>power attack<br>cleave<br>Great cleave<br>improved critical X3<br><br>Weapon focuses: 3<br><br>Specializations: 3<br><br>Dual wield style: 3<br>ambidexterity<br>two weapon fighting<br>improved two weapon fighting<br><br>That's 18 feats hombre. First thing is you should be human. That'll net you 9 pre epic feats You will need at to use charisma as a dump stat, probably wisdom too. To get all of the above you will only get about 4 levels of monk pre-epic! Furthermore, you will have to take 3 more levels of fighter post epic if you want epic specialization and even more if you want overwhelming and devastating critical on all the weapons! I could be wrong, but if yo play it just right you may get about 9 total monk levels. <br><br>My advice, chose one weapon to work with unless you want an almost pure fighter build.

Ah! Right. Thanks for the correction. I have to wonder if the last post you made over 6 months ago was as constructive. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  <br><br>So that's 6 less feats required pre-epic. Frees up about 12 or so fighter levels. That said, you will need the following pre-epic feats for the 2-bladed sword:<br><br>Exotic proficency<br>ambidexterity<br>two-weapon fighting<br>weapon focus<br>weapon specialization<br>improved two weapon fighting<br>power attack<br>cleave<br>great cleave<br>improved critical<br><br>10 feats. Not so bad. You get 8 for being a pre-epic human. If you take 4 levels of fighter to start you can still have a 2 left over before the epics to spend on whatever you want and get four attacks per round. Going 8 fighter 12 monk pre-epic nets you 2 more feats and another point of ab at the cost of some speed, a little diffrence in will and reflex saves and a few skillpoints.<br><br>Post epic think about going mostly monk with 2 great strenght feats followed by epic focus, epic prowess, and finally a fighter level for epic specialization, overwhelming and then devestating critical.

Interesting idea.<br><br>The thing with monk is that, preepic, you get 3/4 ab.  SO, in the interest of putting an idea out there, why not consider 10ftr/10wm/20monk, done exactly like that.  Start with fighter for 10, then wm for 10 then monk in epic.  THis will grant you speed of monk, the bonus feats you want WHILE at the same time, giving you full 30 bab.  IF you dont care about 20 monk, go 19 and take a fighter lv in epic for ews.<br><br>This does alot for what you ask.  Just make sure you bump str alot.  The downside is that in epic you wont get any extra bonus feats, which makes it HARD to go high str.  You only have 7 epic feats, one for ewf, one for epic prowess, leaving 5 for gr str...  its up to you but with what you askd for, this sounds the best option (thanks thax for suggesting)<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 11/27/07 23:01 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I agree with avado, Storm of Vengeance rocks, it stuns great, it can deal heavy damage over time, and Evasion doesn't work against it, you should try it in your strategy as well, too bad it's conjura</div></blockquote>

Well, I would take at least 1 Fighter level epic for Epic Weapon Specialization, and you actually don't get Great Strength V, he wants a dual-wielder with Devastating Critical, in order to go that far, 10 WM is a waste, you can take only 7 and fill with lots and lots of Fighter to grab tons and tons of needed feats, it's 5 feats for Weapon Master [Expertise, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack], 3 feats for dual-wielding [Ambidexterity, Two Weapon Fighting, Improved Two Weapon Fighting] and 6 feats (4 pre-epic, 2 epic) for Dev Crit [Power Attack, Cleave, Great Cleave, Improved Critical - Overwhelming Critical, Devastating Critical]. I'd change the spread to Fighter 14 / Weapon Master 7 / Monk 19 at least, that's 14 pre-epic feats on Human, so you can take all the 12 pre-epic needed feats and still get 2 feats for Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization, plus a Fighter level in epics for Epic Weapon Specialization, so after EWF, OV Crit, Dev Crit and Epic Prowess that leaves only 3 Great Strengths available. I think 14 is the minimum Fighter levels needed to go Weapon Master here, and wasting to Weapon Master 10 is a bad idea, you could take over 14 Fighter to get more Great Strength, but you would end losing Empty Body, which is a pretty damn useful Monk ability. Strength is barely manageable, you'll reach Dev Crit until the end, probably until level 39.<br><br>Dropping Weapon Specialization altogether allows you to take Blind-Fight and 1 more Great Strength, but +6 damage is very worth it.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/19/07 19:10</span></i></p>
