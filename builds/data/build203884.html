Hi Neenex,<br><br>Nice build. I like Dex-based Monks, but don't think I've seen this class blend before. Some quick thoughts:<br><br>1. Move Weapon Finesse to Level 3 instead of 6.<br>2. Why focus in Unarmed as well as Kama? By your own admission, the build is pressed for feats due to the dual-wielding feats, so why not commit to one choice of weaponry?<br>3. I think you'll find Spring Attack is not needed in such a high Dex, high Tumble build.<br>4. I'm not sure if it fully applies to Monks, but is your AB higher if you hit level 20 as Monk 8/SD 4/CoT 8 instead of Monk 10/SD 2/CoT 8?<br>5. I don't think SD gets Discipline as a class skill. Accordingly, can you move your last level of CoT or Monk to 39 or 40 to max out Discipline?<br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br><i>"Where there is life, there is hope." - Grover</i>

Okay, not bad.  A couple of things:  in builds like this, I feel that anything beyond 5 levels of SD is redundant.  The Monk gives you just about everything beyond that.

Good points, guys. I hadn't seen the Zen Guardian, as you'll probably have guessed.<br><br>1. Definitely right about weapon finesse.<br>2. Last three levels of SD are a waste, I can see that. If I make them CoT, get 12 more HP and +1 to saves. If they are monk, I can max out all the key skills. Could probably do without Slippery mind for another couple of HP and +1 to saves.<br>3. Some feats here are "fillers", I suppose - if I replaced Spring Attack with imp crit:unarmed, then it improves her bludgeoning ability a little, though a character like this will only use unarmed against crit immune monsters. I'd like to have taken the Initiative feats, but they aren't available as CoT bonus feats. Not sure I really need Blind Fight either.<br>4. Zen Guardian is very impressive, and undoubtedly has the edge at level 40, what with the extra AC, AB and Spellcraft bonus. It's a tricky call between STR or WIS for me - I chose STR for the extra +3 damage on the Kamas - I personally find it frustrating to have to hit a critter dozens of times to do the same damage others do with one hit. WIS does offer better AC, Saves and Stunning fists, though.

After that, you'll be left way behind.  But that's not the build's focus.  And besides, her sidequest is to find some Str enhancing items.  When I make a dex-build, my first goal is to "not be hit", followed closely behind by "still being able to hit", followed by "how am I going to kill the bloody thing?"  It typically will be a War of attrition, where your Epic Dodge, high AC and concealment will beat your opponents AB, while you wittle him down to nothing.  In both this build and the Zen Guardian, the problem invariably comes down to, How do I kill the Big Boss?  Is the 2 extra damage you are receiving from Str going to really make the difference, or would you rather have that boost your AC to compliment youe Epic Dodge at higher levels?  I don't know. Tough call, and one that really can be justified either way.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

More an exercise in number crunching than anything else, here's the Dev Crit version - same class split as the last, but no wis. I had to go nasty Half Orc (boo - horrible looking model and dreadful unarmed combat animations!), unarmed and drop blinding speed. Much lower AC&amp;AB&amp;saves, but 1d20+7 damage on each of six hits (1d20+4 by level 20), not to mention the dev crit chance. All of which basically means that you don't want to meet him in a dark alley (which is where he will hang out, you can be sure).<br><br>Monk(25), Shadowdancer(5), Champion of Torm(10), Half-Orc<br><br>STR: 19 (25)<br>DEX: 16 (25)<br>CON: 10<br>WIS: 9 (10)<br>INT: 10<br>CHA: 6<br><br>MLevel 01: Monk(1): Toughness, (Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist)<br>Level 02: Monk(2): (Deflect Arrows)<br>Level 03: Monk(3): Power Attack<br>Level 04: Monk(4): DEX+1<br>Level 05: Monk(5)<br>Level 06: Monk(6): Dodge, (Knockdown, Improved Knockdown)<br>Level 07: Monk(7)<br>Level 08: Monk(8): DEX+1<br>Level 09: Monk(9): Ambidexterity, (Improved Evasion)<br>Level 10: Monk(10): (KI Strike +1)<br>Level 11: Monk(11): (Diamond Soul)<br>Level 12: Monk(12): DEX+1, Mobility, (Diamond Body)<br>Level 13: Monk(13): (KI Strike +2)<br>Level 14: Monk(14)<br>Level 15: Monk(15): Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br>Level 16: Monk(16): DEX+1, (KI Strike +3)<br>Level 17: Monk(17)<br>Level 18: Monk(18): Improved Critical: Unarmed<br>Level 19: Monk(19)<br>Level 20: Monk(20): DEX+1<br>Level 21: Shadowdancer(1): Great Dexterity I, (Hide in Plain Sight)<br>Level 22: Shadowdancer(2): (Uncanny Dodge I)<br>Level 23: Shadowdancer(3)<br>Level 24: Shadowdancer(4): DEX+1, Great Dexterity II<br>Level 25: Shadowdancer(5): (Defensive Roll)<br>Level 26: Champion of Torm(1): (Lay on Hands)<br>Level 27: Champion of Torm(2): Great Dexterity III, Epic Weapon Focus: Unarmed, (Sacred Defense)<br>Level 28: Champion of Torm(3): STR+1, (Smite Evil)<br>Level 29: Champion of Torm(4): Epic Prowess<br>Level 30: Champion of Torm(5): Epic Dodge, (Divine Wrath)<br>Level 31: Champion of Torm(6): Great Wisdom I<br>Level 32: Champion of Torm(7): STR+1<br>Level 33: Champion of Torm(8): Great Strength I, Great Cleave<br>Level 34: Monk(21)<br>Level 35: Monk(22)<br>Level 36: Monk(23): STR+1, Great Strength II<br>Level 37: Monk(24)<br>Level 38: Monk(25): Armor Skin<br>Level 39: Champion of Torm(9): Overwhelming Critical: Unarmed<br>Level 40: Champion of Torm(10): STR+1, Devastating Critical: Unarmed
