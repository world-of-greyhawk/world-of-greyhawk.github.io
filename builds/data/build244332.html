Basically been having fun with Rangers recently, this is one idea for those that think a ranger needs to be able to tough out a fight when strategy is not an option.  The goal was to get EDR III and BoE as soon as possible.  Both come a little late for my liking, but I already had to sacrifice AB just to achieve it.<br>One thing is that you can wear heavy armour, which I found to be very helpful.  Switching to light armour, especially in worlds where you gain a speed bonus, makes trap setting quite decent.  Dual wielding is not recommended, but it is still an option for those who play carefully.<br>I have tried to strengthen the weaker areas, but I am still not too happy with the end result.  But the RP-idea is fun.  A dwarf who chooses the way of the ranger, yet uses these methods (traps, stealth, alertness, animal companion) down in the deep of the mountain.<br>This is probably more of a tankish battle ranger, but I am working on an different path for those looking for a more traditional ranger.<br><br>Suggestions in keeping with the buld idea are welcome. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br><br><b>Name: </b>Hunter in the Dark<br><b>Classes: </b>Ranger 26, Fighter 12, Shadowdancer 2<br><b>Playable 1-40, PvM</b><br><b>Race: </b>Dwarf<br><b>Alignment: </b>Any<br><br><b>Stats: </b><br><br>Str 14 to 24<br>Dex 14 to 14<br>Con 16 to 22<br>Wis 14 to 14<br>Int 14 to 14<br>Cha 6 to 6<br><br><br><b>Leveling: </b><br><br>1 Ranger1 WF FE1<br>2 Fighter1 Dodge<br>3 Fighter2 BF<br>4 Fighter3 (STR 15)<br>5 Fighter4 WS<br>6 Ranger2 Mobility<br>7 Ranger3<br>8 Shadowdancer1 (STR 16)<br>9 Shadowdancer2 IC<br>10 Ranger4<br>11 Ranger5 FE2<br>12 Ranger6 Iron Will (STR 17)<br>13 Ranger7<br>14 Ranger8<br>15 Ranger9 Great Fort<br>16 Ranger10 FE3(STR 18)<br>17 Ranger11<br>18 Ranger12 Lightning Reflexes<br>19 Ranger13<br>20 Ranger14 (CON 17)<br><br>21 Ranger15 EWF, Great Con I (CON 18)<br>22 Ranger16<br>23 Ranger17<br>24 Ranger18 Great Con II (CON 20)<br>25 Ranger19<br>26 Ranger20 FE4<br>27 Ranger21 Bane of Enemies<br>28 Fighter5 (CON 21)<br>29 Fighter6 EDR I<br>30 Fighter7 Great Str I<br>31 Fighter8 EDR II<br>32 Fighter9<br>33 Fighter10 Great Str II, EDR III<br>34 Ranger22<br>35 Fighter11<br>36 Fighter12 Great Str III, EWS<br>37 Ranger23 FE5<br>38 Ranger24<br>39 Ranger25 Great Con III<br>40 Ranger26 FE6<br><br><br><br><br><b>Skills: </b>104 Ranger + 24 Fighter + 12 Shadowdancer + 80 INT = 220<br>Discipline 43 [50]<br>Hide 10 [12]<br>Move Silently 30 [32]<br>Tumble 10(15 skill points spent)<br>Set Trap 33[35]<br>Craft Trap 33[35]<br>Listen 43[45] +7 vs FEs<br>Heal 13[15]<br><br><br><b>Spells: </b>All 4 Ranger level of spells<br>1: Camoflage, Ultravision, Resist Elements<br>2: Cat's Grace, One with Land, Protection from Elements<br>3: Aid, Invisibility Purge, Greater Magic Fang<br>4: Mass Camoflage<br><br><br><b>HP: </b>616<br><br><br><b>AC: </b>14 naked, 24 with fullplate and shield, 22-23 buffed in chain shirt with towershield, 19 dual-wielding in hide.

Well, I need to reallocate some more points into tumble.  But waiting for the second level of SD is probably ok.  The only draw back is that uncanny dodge and evasion come extremely late.  if you want the option of using lighter armour then you need this.  I prefer to keep a set of the light stuff around, just for this purpose.  Also keeps you in the best armour you can find, for the right situation.  Cast a cat's grace and wear something lighter if you need to sneak or are in a party without a rogue.  But in general you guys are right, this one is mostly in heavy armour, so postponing SD2 is (probably) the right choice.  I just like giving him the option.

Epic prowess is a ranger bonus feat.<br><br>Or he could postpone BoE to a ranger feat and take AS on that level.

I agree with everything said thus far.<br>And I do find that level 26 is a good cut off point, but the more FEs the better.  But 6 or 7 is about right.  Enough to be powerful and enough levels left over to do something with them.<br>Thanks for all the helpful comments and encouragements.<br><br>-cs
