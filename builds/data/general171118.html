Hi,<br><br>Have you looked through the list of builds in the guild? I found this strength-based dual-kama monk:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117410", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Strength-based means you're focusing on developing strength, as opposed to a Dex-based monk which is more agile but hits less hard.<br><br>Try out this build in an off-line training module (like the link in my sig) and then come back and post with your questions/thoughts. It will help everyone to better assist you.<br><br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br>Check out the Epic Character Builders Guild<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Test your new builds in this mod:<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/modules/data/1073117317280.shtml" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

You can build it either way. If you go STR based, you will have higher damage potential, but weaker defenses. If you go DEX based, you have higher defensive ability, but may run into trouble with damage resistance. If you go DEX based, I'd suggest still having enough STR to take a power attack feat, and maybe improved power attack.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>
