Why are you taking Zen archery may I ask? It seems like a wasted feat in your build. Otherwise looks like a nice shifter with some very thick skin <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> .

Right on.  Cool build.  My only concern would be that you didn't take Improved Unarmed Attack at some point.  Golem forms count as unarmed.  Then again, I don't know if an attacking Golem shifter would provoke AoO -- never tried it.  But that's the reason most Shifter builds have at least some Monk levels thrown in -- most forms count as unarmed.<br><br>Again, may not be a concern for you.  Even if you did provoke AoOs, you should be well able to take them.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Zen Archery = Taking advantage of a high Wis score.  It gives the character a good balance between melee and ranged.  As a defender, he can pick off enemies at a distance in human form and then polymorph into golem form when they get close. I take it at 12 because that's the first DD level, when I get martial weapons for free.<br><br>Good call on the Improved unarmed attack!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By sketchy_c on 08/06/04 06:29</span></i></p>

Many believe it gives you a free hit on ALL surrounding monsters when you kill one, but it doesn't.  It merely allows you to cleave(1 free hit after a kill) an unlimited times per round.  So if you killed 4 creatures in 1 round you get 4 free hits.  Generally if you kill more than 1 creature in 1 round you are fighting guys much much lower than yourself and it really isn't nessasary.  Though you could have fun with the skill if you put an incrediably powerful weapon in the hands of a lvl 1 char, surrounded him with very low hp guys and let him wack one of em.

Yes, I know how much fun Great Cleave is when playing the OC (with SOU installed) for the first time. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   Thanks for that.

Imp Unarmed Attack is useless for Shapes as they already have it, or so I've read.
