Let's all admit it - Red Mages are awesome in the Final Fantasy series.  That having been said, I figured it would be fun to try creating a Red Mage build for NWN.  This isn't much of a munchkin build for obvious reasons, but I tried to make it as powerful as possible while still keeping as many elements of the traditional Red Mage as possible (quick casting, rapier usage, above-average competency in both elemental damage and healing magic, etc.)<br><br><b>Playable from level 1 - 40 PvM</b><br><br>(Human)<br>str: 8/8<br>dex: 16/22<br>con: 8/8<br>int: 16/20<br>wis: 16/16<br>cha: 8/8<br><br>(Levels)<br>1-3: FIGHTER = Toughness, WeapFoc:Rapier, Weapon Finesse, Dodge<br>4-6: CLERIC = Healing and War domains, Still Spell<br>7-20: WIZARD = Evocation school specialization, SpellFocus:Evo, GrtSpellFocus:Evo, ImprvdCrit:Rapier, SpellPenet, GrtSpellPenet, Maximize Spell<br>21: FIGHTER = WeaponSpec:Rapier, EpicWeapFoc:Rapier<br>22-24: WIZARD = Quicken Spell, AutoStillSpell I<br>25-26: CLERIC<br>27: WIZARD = AutoStillSpell II<br>28-29: CLERIC<br>30: WIZARD = AutoStillSpell III<br>31-32: CLERIC<br>33: WIZARD = AutoQuickSpell I, II<br>34-35: CLERIC<br>36-37: WIZARD = AutoQuickSpell III<br>38: FIGHTER<br>39: WIZARD = EpSpellFocus:Evo, Epic Spell: Mage Armor<br>40: FIGTHER = EpicWeapSpec:Rapier<br><br>(Skills)<br>Concentration - 43<br>Discipline - 43<br>Parry - 43<br>Spellcraft - 42<br>Tumble - 21<br>+miscellany<br><br>------------------------<br><br>Naked-sans-buffs with a rapier, we have 20 AC, just shy of 200 HP, and an AB of 31; saves of 19(f), 22(r), and 26(w). Buffs and equipment boost everything nicely.  Our spells aren't at all bad, as we have access to all levels and can cast everything Quickened and Stilled automatically (I myself mostly use maximized mid-level spells, as the fire/cold/lightning evocation spells seem to be most prolific there, and that's more Final Fantasy-ish, non?).  Our spell focus and penetration feats should make up for a lack of Wizard - and rarely Cleric - levels, and since we took Healing domain we can cast Heal 5 times, and any other generic healing spell is automatically Empowered.<br><br>Thoughts? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 09/30/05 18:12</span></i></p>

I like to use a lot of Maximized Isaac's Greater Missile Storm, Chain Lightning, Firebrand, Cone of Cold, Ball Lightning, Wall of Fire, and Ice Storm.  Best of all though, with everything automatically Quickened (more with Haste), you'd be quite surprised how quickly you can dump a fierce volley of spells into enemies - against a single foe, for example, the rate of damage/time pouring out a bunch of maxed IGMS's is quite fun.<br><br>Again, perhaps that's not so efficient as I would have been specializing Necromancy and casting Wail of the Banshee, but that's just what I chose.  The build could easily be altered to accomodate such casting styles.

I have, but I wanted something different so that could use a rapier, have better saves myself, and not have to focus on spells without saves <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   Not having to worry about some saves lends versatility, and versatility is part of what a Red Mage is about.  Also, Red Mages were never really more than decently good with their rapiers, and certainly not good enough to warrant Devastating Critical <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   Like I said, I tried to make my guy as close to the Final Fantasy image of a Red Mage as I could get <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

I dont see builds like this too often so its a treat to see this. I like the build and you have stuck to your ideal. it also has great potential for roleplaying. Your chosen spells definately reflect that. In my eyes you deserve an applause (however I cant give you full credit since it is a final fintasy idea).
