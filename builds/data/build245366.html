If you can't KD him, you should still take your time to taunt him, unless you are uncertain you can survive 1 round of flat-footedness. You must make the Smite count. When up against epic dodgers do not taunt, sneak-attacks will get you. It is very important to time your attacks. I assume you are hasted, for 5 APR. Smite on your first attack AND second attack (the first flurry), he will EVADE the first one and have spent the Dodge. Then leave the second flurry to itself, and smite again with your last attack (at MAX AB.) Should do the trick. Or hold off your smites and wait for the EVADE msg to show and deliver three quick smites and hope the round doesn't turn. <br><br>With PvM, try to taunt opponents that fight someone else or after they are knocked down.<br><br>This build gets 17 Epic Feats. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br>There are many smiters around, I just wanted to do one that really do it to the max.

Well done Grim, I was wondering how much more time you needed to post it since we talked about it in the build request forum and I was almost about to post my now tested version <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  (which is almost the same)<br><br>I'd go with scimitar to maximise the chance of critical smite (at least in PvM), but for the rest, nothing to add.

*bows*<br><br>Thank you for this one!  You are certainly the master smiter!  I can remember tryin to do this last year (when it was cool <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">  to be a smiter), but the most I could get was smite 7 or something.  I see my flaws now... tried to get too greedy with the charisma (iirc i tried to get 32 or something like that!).  *edit* I remember now!  I was tryin to make a HUGE divine mighter PLUS a great smiter!  *like the edit before the post <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  *<br><br> I am wondering if it would be worth it to drop cha to 24 and take str to 20?

Hey, Grim, nice build - you went for it, smite X did ya? Cool! Yeah, AC seems to be a problem on these ones, but the divines sure help out. Nice skills, too. AB ain't too bad (that's what on smiters the cha-bonus is for <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   nor is the damage bad either (got the divine and spells, too). Ah, but Smite X, my friend - my version, as you know, went for the str/ab stuff, and stopped thus at a weak smite V <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  ah, but with smite X, heck, what follow-up combat? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     <br><br>Cool! It's a beach smite only works on evil, but still, you went for it, oh master of Norse Lore - smite X - it just looks so darn good!

On the other hand it effectively induces a penalty of 4 to the defender's Disc roll.

So correct me if I'm wrong, but without IKD you cant hit anything larger than two size categories higher than you right?<br><br>So large yes, but above large you cant?<br><br>Just to avoid some confusion I've been having <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>// Maniac_Mailman<br>_________________<br><i>"Omnes morimur et quasi aqua dilabimur in terram, qua non revertuntur..."</i><br>- Maniac_Mailman aka Nr|Five<br><br>Admin @ NWN BOTD Team PvP<br>Admin @ <a href="http://www.gameshrine.org" target="_blank">www.gameshrine.org</a><br><br>Member of the Epic Character Builders Guild

Grim, just thought I'd add this link to your cool smiter, too, so folks can see what spells pally's get to choose from; afterall, 26 level Pally, gets some nice buffs and, in addition to the divines, the spells help out with saves, AC, and AB, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Once again, well done, oh master of Norse Lore; and hey, if you're gonna squeeze all 10 of 'em in there (as you do), might as make each smite count (and well you do! Nice, Grim: smite on against those nasty evil forces, indeed! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>And now for that link: <a href="http://www.planetneverwinter.com/nwn/player/spells/paladin/" target="_blank">Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/02/06 01:21</span></i></p>
