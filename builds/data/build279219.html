The major differences, i.e. the reason I still took the time to post my build, lie in the fact that with more WM lvls you still get the weapon spec feats (non-epic specialization actually getting taken much sooner with my build) you still keep the 1 per 1 BAB progression and you get 14 uses of Ki damage instead 7.  Also, a barbarian dual-wielding hammers makes a little more sense to me than scimitars, even though AB is obviously better with scimmies, but you do get an extra 1d6 from Overwhelming Critical with the warhammers.  Now after explaining all that I fear I may sound like I'm criticizing the Eastern Warrior, so let me say that I am absolutely not and that I think Eastern Warrior is a fantastic build.  Also, just want to take the time to say that I had actually not even bothered to search any of these builds prior to making my own, because I wanted to try to come up with the whole build on my own.

First, I wanted to dual wield warhammers, just for fun.<br>Second, I wanted all 4 Over. Crit, Dev. Crit, Thundering Rage and Terrifying Rage.<br>I only put cha up to 10 b/c I hate playing and having npc's act like arrogant prats.  But the 2 pts would be better used in Con.<br>Could have also shaved one pt off Dex and Int to put into Con, but I personally consider 440 HP a decent amount.<br>Also the extra point into Int helps with an extra skill pt. per lvl<br><br>Alternatively, I think this build would be a lot of fun to play using Greathammer, and swapping dual-wield skills for<br>Iron Will, Luck of Heroes, etc.<br>This being my first attempt at an epic build, I would greatly appreciate any constructive criticism.<br><br>I was working on an awesome background story for this guy but between work and my wife, I hardly have time for much.  Maybe I'll finish it later.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Seraph

Good solid tanker/dmgdealer.<br><br>I do think that there are other and b€tter options available for this sort of class combination like the<br>28bar/5ftr/7wm and 16barb/5ftr/19wm.<br><br>It is very playable and good for any PvM world. <br>It can pvp, but others will be better off than this build.

I'd drop that 14th WM level and add another BBN level. If memory serves, that will give you one more point of DR, while the 14th WM level gives you very little.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
