<b>Overview:</b> Druids are described as the protectors of nature, and indeed many of their innate abilities tie into that. As far as what they are in NWN is another description. In NWN they are basically a hybrid class capable of healing, offensive spell casting, and melee combat. As a player you need to decide where to focus your efforts.<br><br><b>Alignment restriction:</b> A druid must be part neutral. Thsi restricts them to Lawful Neutral, Chaotic Neutral, Neutral Good, Neutral Evil, or True Neutral. If a druid ever loses his neutrality, he can not gain any more levels in the druid class.<br><br><b>Hit Die:</b> d8<br><br><b>Class skills:</b> A druid gets 4 +int bonus skill points per level. At first level a druid gets 4* this amount.<br><br><b>Druid weapons:</b> The weapon proficiency(druid) feat consists of the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, sickle, scimitar, spear, sling and quarterstaff.<br><br><b>Druid armor:</b> Unlike in pnp rules, a druid may use metal armor in NWN. Initially they may use any light or medium armor and all shields.<br><br><b>Spell casting:</b> Divine (Wis based) (see chart below}<br><br><b>Abilities:</b><br>Strength: Moderately important if you plan on melee fighting a lot. Most alternate shapes change this ability. I suggest only getting what you need to meat feat requirements.<br><br>Dexterity: Moderately important. You won't be wearing heavy armor, so a +2 adjustment may be very handy. Most alternate shapes have this ability change though, so don't invest to much in it. Barring multiclass issues, 14 is plenty.<br><br>Constitution: Moderately important. Obviously more life is better, but 10-14 is plenty for most druids.<br><br>Wisdom: Extremely important. It affects your spell Dc as well as gaining bonus spells. You also need 30 to get the dragon shape feat.<br><br>Intelligence: Moderately important. A druid gets a decent amount of skill points per level a human druid can easily get by with 10-12 while non humans may want to have between 12-14.<br><br>Charisma: Not very important. If you plan on using animal empathy, hen you may want to have a few points here. Otherwise you can get by easily on 6-10.<br><br><b>Class Abilities:</b><br>1st level-<br>Nature Sense: A druid gets a +2 to all attacks when fighting in wilderness areas.<br>Animal Companion: 1/day A druid may summon a companion that stays with the summoner until killed or unsummoned. The type of companion can be changed at each level increase<br><br>2nd level-<br>Woodland Stride: Immune to grease, webs and entangle spells and effects.<br><br>3rd level-<br>Trackless Step: A drudi gets a +4 bonus to hide and move silently checks in wilderness areas.<br><br>4th level-<br>Resist Natures Lure: A drudi gets a +2 insight bonus to saving throws against all fear spells and effects.<br><br>5th level- <br>Wild Shape: 1/ day may change into an animal shape. The shape lasts one hour per class level. The shapes improves as you gain druid levels.<br><br>6th level-<br>Wild Shape: 2/day<br><br>7th level-<br>Wild Shape: 3/day<br><br>9th level-<br>Venom Immunity: A druid becomes immune to poison<br><br>10th level-<br>Wild Shape: 4/day<br><br>14th level-<br>Wild Shape: 5/day<br><br>16th level-<br>Elemental Shape: 1/day A druid may become a huge elemental of his choice.<br><br>17th level-<br>Elemental Shape: 2/day<br><br>18th level-<br>Wild Shape: 6/day<br><br>19th level-<br>Elemental Shape: 3/day<br><br>20th level-<br>Elemental Shape: A druid now changes to an elder elemental form instead of the previous huge form.<br><br>22nd level-<br>Wild Shape: infinite uses per day<br><br>26th level-<br>Elemental Shape: infinite uses per day<br><br><b>Spell chart:</b><br><br>1st:  3|1<br>2nd:  4|2<br>3rd:  4|2|1<br>4th:  5|3|2<br>5th:  5|3|2|1<br>6th:  5|3|3|2<br>7th:  6|4|3|2|1<br>8th:  6|4|3|3|2<br>9th:  6|4|4|3|2|1<br>10th: 6|4|4|3|3|2<br>11th: 6|5|4|4|3|2|1<br>12th: 6|5|4|4|3|3|2<br>13th: 6|5|5|4|4|3|2|1<br>14th: 6|5|5|4|4|3|3|2<br>15th: 6|5|5|5|4|4|3|2|1<br>16th: 6|5|5|5|4|4|3|3|2<br>17th: 6|5|5|5|5|4|4|3|2|1<br>18th: 6|5|5|5|5|4|4|3|3|2<br>19th: 6|5|5|5|5|5|4|4|3|3<br>20th: 6|5|5|5|5|5|4|4|4|4<br><br><b>Attack/Saves Chart:</b><br>level| BAB     |Fort|Refl|Will<br>1 |   +0          |+2   |+0   |+2<br>2 |   +1          |+3   |+0   |+3<br>3 |   +2          |+3   |+1   |+3<br>4 |   +3          |+4   |+1   |+4<br>5 |   +3          |+4   |+1   |+4<br>6 |   +4          |+5   |+2   |+5<br>7 |   +5          |+5   |+2   |+5<br>8 |   +6/+1       |+6   |+2   |+6<br>9 |   +6/+1       |+6   |+3   |+6<br>10 |  +7/+2       |+7   |+3   |+7<br>11 |  +8/+3       |+7   |+3   |+7<br>12 |  +9/+4       |+8   |+4   |+8<br>13 |  +9/+4       |+8   |+4   |+8<br>14 |  +10/+5      |+9   |+4   |+9<br>15 |  +11/+6/+1   |+9   |+5   |+9<br>16 |  +12/+7/+2  |+10   |+5  |+10<br>17 |  +12/+7/+2  |+10   |+5  |+10<br>18 |  +13/+8/+3  |+11   |+6  |+11<br>19 |  +14/+9/+4  |+11   |+6  |+11<br>20 |  +15/+10/+5 |+12   |+6  |+12<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Emrill on 08/25/04 01:04</span></i></p>

<b>Combines well with</b><br>- Shifter, naturally, as this class was meant for druids, gives lots of nice extra shapes<br>- Monk, druids usually have high wisdom, which makes the monk's AC bonus very interesting (carries over to shapes) and the unarmed shapes also benefit from the monk's unarmed feats.<br><br>- Fighter, to boost some form's offensive capabilities and you can get a couple of extra feats, a little more HP and better AB.<br>- Cleric, for some extra spell buffs (little experience with this one though...)<br><br>And there are some I have no experience with, perhaps some others would like give some info on them:<br>- CoT<br>- DwD<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Dimundome on 08/25/04 15:05</span></i></p>

I didn't include multiclass items per rules of this forum. I was going to do a wild shape study to add to it. I figured anything with shifter/CoT/fighter could go under topics for those classes as it pertains to those classes and only indirectly to the druid class.

Perhaps keeping the main subject intact with the top post to be a basic class overview. Then replies can be how another class works with it. The thing would be to keep each reply to one class interaction. That would eliminate information overload. <br><br>Take xitooner's reply for instance. It is extremely informative and kept to how the one class can enhance the main topic's class. Add a header at the top along the lines of <b>Druid-Champion of Trrm Interaction</b> and that would be extremely helpful to readers sorting through the mass of info that hopefully each class will present.

There is some valuable information that is always left out for Druids that I for one would find extremely useful about this class. I wish I had the answers, but I don't. So I'm putting this out there as a challenge for hard core Druid users.<br><br>1) List the forms Druids can shift into and list the following things that change. Also, do they increase at higher levels for example, does the Bear form's Str get higher based on the Druid level?<br><ul><br><li>Stat bonuses/changes<br></li><li>Skill bonus/penalty<br></li><li>Special abilities/feats<br></li><li>Immunities<br></li><li>AC bonus/penalty<br></li><li>HP bonus/penalty<br></li><li>Save bonus/penalty<br></li><li>Attack bonuses/penalties<br></li><li>Damage bonuses/penalties<br></li></ul><br>2) When do unusual forms become available? I know the basic forms are Bear, Wolf, Badger, and Boar. But I also heard that Tiny animal forms (Hawk) becomes available after 9th level Druid, and Dire forms (Dire Wolf) become available at 12th, etc. And later you can take a variety of Elemental Forms.<br><br>3) Do they get better? I also read that the Druid can turn into basic Animal forms an unlimited # times per day around 17th level or so and Elemental form unlimited at 22nd level or so. Is this true?<br><br>4) Unusual things should also be included about the Druid. For example, unlike other classes the Druid class may NEVER take Martial or Exotic Weapon proficiency. The only way to get these is via another class such as the Figher who gets Martial Proficiency for free or by taking another class on a level when you would like to take the feat.<br><br>5) Best, must-have, and underrated spells for Druids.<br><br>6) A section on Animal Companions, what they do, their stat bonuses, special abilities, feats, hp, damage, and when they increase (for example, I know the Dire Wolf and regular Wolf's Dex increases every few levels giving them a better AC).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By georgel on 10/26/04 22:27</span></i></p>

<b>The Druid’s Spellbook</b><br><br>To round this topic off a bit and because I posted an epic Druid build which focused on melee in its own form, I thought I'd post this here.<br><br>Info on the Druid Spells and some pointers on how to use them.<br><br>Though outdated, Raama's guide on GameFAQs might also help. <a href="http://db.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/file/neverwinter_nights_druid.txt" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br><b>Buffs:</b><br>Cantrips: Resistance, Virtue<br>I: Camouflage, Endure Elements, Magic Fang, Ultravision<br>II: Barkskin, Blood Frenzy, Bull’s Strength, One with the Land, Resist Elements<br>III: Protection from the Elements, Greater Magic Fang<br>IV: Freedom of Movement, Mass Camouflage, Stoneskin<br>V: Awaken, Death Ward, Monstrous Regeneration, Owl’s Insight, Spell Resistance<br>VI: Energy Buffer, Greater Stoneskin, Regenerate<br>VII:  Aura of Vitality, True Seeing<br>VIII: Premonition<br><br>Key Buffs: Barkskin (+5 Natural AC), Bull’s Strength, Protection from the Elements (long-term elemental protection), Owl’s Insight (a must), Stoneskin for your allies, Greater Stoneskin/Premonition for yourself, Aura of Vitality and Blood Frenzy for tougher battles. Use Awaken and Greater Magic Fang on your animal companion if you’re going to use it; they leech exp and are quite delicate.<br><br>The various elemental protection buffs will help a lot with surviving traps and Stoneskin works wonders with excellent DR at lower levels (but these DR spells are pretty much useless with lots of magic around). While Clerics can get the DR buffs, chances are they don’t have all of them. They will help tons in helping you to survive melee.<br><br><b>Breakdown of buffs:</b><br><br><i>Vital Buffs:</i><br>Barkskin: +3 to +5 to natural AC. Levels 1-6: +3, 7-12: +4, 13+: +5; 1 hour /lvl<br><br>Bull’s Strength: 1d4 +1 to STR, 1 hour /lvl<br><br>Owl’s Insight: adds casterlevel/2 to the target’s WIS (until you reach lvl 24 and hit the hardcoded +12 enchantment bonus to any ability cap). Druid only (muahahaha finally). While this may not grant permanent spellslots you can use for anything, this will increase the DC of your spells and any other WIS-based caster’s spells. I hour/lvl.<br><br><i>DR:</i><br>Stoneskin: grants the target 10/+5 DR, absorbing 10 pts of melee damage per casterlevel to a max of 100 before collapsing. 1 hour/lvl.<br><br>Greater Stoneskin: grants the caster 20/+5 DR, absorbing 10 pts of melee damage per casterlevel to a max of 150 before collapsing. 1 hour/lvl.<br><br>Premonition: grants the caster 30/+5 DR, absorbing 10 pts of melee damage per casterlevel (notice: uncapped!) before collapsing or until the time runs out. 1 hour/lvl.<br><br><i>Elemental Resistance:</i><br>Protection from the Elements: 30/- against all elemental forms of damage, absorbing up to 40 pts of damage from any single element type before collapsing. 24 hours. The other elemental protection spells don’t last as long.<br><br>Energy Buffer: 40/- against all elemental forms of damage, absorbing up to 60 pts of damage from any single element type before collapsing. 1 turn/casterlevel.<br><br><i>Battle Spells:</i><br>Blood Frenzy: gives the caster +2 to STR and CON and +1 to Will saves, -1 penalty to AC (somewhat like the Barbarian’s Rage). 1 round/lvl.<br><br>Aura of Vitality: all allies within the area of effect (colossal) receive a +4 bonus to STR, DEX and CON. I round/lvl.<br><br>Monstrous Regeneration: gives the target the ability to regenerate 3 HP per round for the duration of the spell. 1 round/2 casterlevels. Use for long, tough battles. (BTW the spell documentation is wrong – Druid also get this spell, not just Clerics)<br><br>Regeneration: gives the target the ability to regenerate 6 HP per round for the duration of the spell. 1 round/casterlevels. Use for long, tough battles – better than the former spell.<br><br>Resistance: gives the target +1 to saves, lasts for 2 turns.<br><br><i>Buffs for your Animal Companion:</i><br>Magic Fang: gives your animal companion +1 AB, +1 damage and +1 to bypass DR. 1 turn/lvl.<br><br>Greater Magic Fang: gives your animal companion +1/3 casterlevels (to a max of +5) to AB and damage and also the corresponding DR. 1 turn/lvl.<br><br>Awaken: gives the targeted Animal Companion +4 STR, +4 CON, +1d10 WIS, and +2 AB for as long as it remains by the Druid’s side (funny spell description :S). Special duration – lasts for however long until you rest.<br><br><i>Misc buffs:</i><br>Freedom of Movement: grants Freedom – immunity to paralysis, slow and entanglement spells and effects. While Druids are immune to these effects, your party-mates probably aren’t. 1 turn/lvl.<br><br>Death Ward: protects from death spells, spell-like abilities and effects<br><br>Spell Resistance: grants the target 12 + 1 per casterlevel SR, 1 turn/lvl. Obviously, use if there’s lots of casters around.<br><br>Ultravision: lets you see in the dark and pierces the effects of Darkness, 1 hour /lvl<br><br>True Seeing: the target can see through Sanctuary and Invisibility effects and can automatically see hiding creatures. Use against rogues and other sneaky types <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    . 1 turn/lvl.<br><br>Camouflage, Mass Camouflage will mostly help your party’s sneakers. Camouflage gives +10 to Hide. One with the Land gives +3 to mainly Ranger skills and can only affect yourself (+3 to Animal Empathy though you may find helpful).<br><br><b>Healing and Restoration:</b><br>Cantrips: Cure Minor Wounds<br>I: Cure Light Wounds<br>II: Lesser Restoration<br>III: Cure Moderate Wounds, Neutralize Poison, Remove Disease<br>IV: Cure Serious Wounds<br>V: Cure Critical Wounds<br>VI: Healing Circle<br>VII: Heal<br>VIII: Nature’s Balance<br>IX: Mass Heal<br><br>Pretty self-explanatory – Clerics can heal better but memorize a few of these if you feel they’re needed.<br><br><b>Direct Damage:</b><br>II: Flame Lash<br>III: Call Lightning, Healing Sting, Quillfire<br>IV: Flame Strike<br>V: Ice Storm<br>VII: Fire Storm, Harm<br>VIII: Bombardment, Sunbeam, Sunburst<br>IX: Earthquake<br><br>Call Lightning is very good at lower levels – just memorize a whole lot of them and spam when you’re getting swarmed. I never learnt how to use Ice Storm properly but it’s apparently very powerful at higher levels. Sunbeam and Sunburst are mainly for killing undead. The higher level spells can hurt if you manage to hit stuff with them but you have limited spell slots which are better used for buffs. Leave the offensive casting to the Wizzies/Sorcs.<br><br><b>One-hit-kill Buttons:</b><br>V: Slay Living<br>VI: Drown<br>VII: Harm (pretty close), Heal (for undead)<br>VIII: Finger of Death<br><br>You might just get lucky - you never know <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> . To maximize your chances with Harm, you can try casting Nature’s Balance (level 8 – lowers enemies’ SR by 1d4 per caster level, no SR just a Will save).<br><br><b>Area of Effect:</b><br>Cantrips:<br>I: Entangle, Grease, Sleep<br>III: Spike Growth<br>V: Vine Mine, Wall of Fire<br>VII: Creeping Doom<br>VIII: Nature’s Balance (lowers SR)<br>IX: Storm of Vengeance<br><br>Quite a few disabling spells, crowd control. Sleep which leads to coup-de-grace is funny if you can get it to work and slipping monsters in Grease heehee. Use Creeping Doom with a good paralyzing spell like Stonehold to keep the sucker(s) there while he slowly dies. Storm of Vengeance is good for softening-up large groups is it works properly where you are playing.<br><br><b>Disabling/Indirect Damage:</b><br>Cantrips: Flare<br>I: Entangle, Grease, Sleep<br>II: Charm Person or Animal, Hold Animal<br>III: Contagion, Dominate Animal, Infestation of Maggots, Poison<br>IV: Hold Monster<br>V: Inferno<br>VI: Stonehold<br><br>Inferno to do damage/time to a tougher enemy; Stonehold best used in conjunction with an AoE spell (especially Creeping Doom – to keep the target there).<br><br><b>Summoning:</b><br>I: Summon Creature I<br>II: Summon Creature II<br>III: Summon Creature III<br>IV: Summon Creature IV<br>V: Summon Creature V<br>VI: Summon Creature VI<br>VII: Summon Creature VII<br>VIII: Summon Creature VIII<br>IX: Summon Creature IX, Elemental Swarm<br><br>Use summons to provide more distractions in battle to help you and your allies survive. Elemental Swarm is especially nice for 4 distractions for one spell-slot but it’s a level 9 spell.<br><br><b>Misc/Special Circumstances:</b><br>Cantrips: Light<br>II: Lesser Dispel<br>IV: Dispel Magic<br>VI: Greater Dispelling, Crumble<br>IX: Shapechange<br><br>Dispels – have a few memorized in case you encounter casters for counterspelling or if you meet with nasty AoE spells. Crumble is a good damage spell against Constructs (instant 1d6 damage per caster-level to a max of 15d6 to a selected construct, no save, no SR) but nothing else.<br><br>Shapechange allows you to change into either a Red Dragon, Fire Giant, Balor, Death Slaad or Iron Golem. Maybe useful at lower levels – items will not work but your buffs will still be there (and your WIS bonus while unarmored will translate if you’ve multiclassed into Monk as WIS is rarely overwritten but shapechanging also makes you forget some of your last-memorised spells). Also useful (along with your limited shifting abilities) if your server/mod you’re playing in has the rest ambush script (like in HoTU) if you don’t have any ranks in Hide/MS and have a heady armor check penalty.<br><br>Anyhow, Druids probably do best in a low-magic environment as most of the benefits granted by Druid spells can also be put on item properties.<br><br>Also, while this may have been posted above, Druids basically get Freedom (well, immunity to Grease, Web and Entangle) and immunity to Poison as well as +2 to AB in wilderness areas and some other less-important stuff Druid-specific stuff. Your animal companion also increases levels with casterlevel.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Jennalee on 09/22/05 13:10</span></i></p>
