He can't.  I'm not sure what he was thinking, but it's probably residue from a previous attempt that probably aimed for EDR.  <br><br>The only other thing I see, is why Paladin at all?  I noticed your preamble mentions that there was little reason to go beyond 15 levels of Paladin, but I can think of many.  Such as, getting 3 Holy Swords a day instead of one, and increasing the duration of all you buffs, particularly Holy Sword.  It has also been determined that Paladin level has a direct correlation to the effectiveness of the on-hit Dispel (though what formula is used is anybody's guess).  In other word's, not all Holy Weapons are created equal.<br><br>But with no charisma, no Smiting or Divine feats, I'm not sure why you took Paladin at all, unless it was to buff, and in which case, why not take a Cleric and get better buffs?<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Well the Grimoire indicates that the WM class gets Damage Reduction as a feat and when you click on it, it jumps to the barbarian DR -1 off every attack.  <br><br>As for the other, well, you could take cleric at the cost of five AB (three base (you'd take cleric to 12 in pre-epic) and two for having to allocate ability points from STR to WIS for the level 8 spells.  Your AB would still be ok but it'd be a completely different build.  <br><br>All in all, I like the build as scripted.  You might have to take Improved Whirlwind Attack - useless - instead of DR but I will have to check that.  If so, the choice between three extra pally levels and the three WM levels becomes tighter.  One AB and a useless bonus feat v. extra spell slots, effectiveness, and duration.  So you would be pally 18, WM 19, rog 3.  Which could work.

You lose darkfire but you can use the scroll or flame weapon, if either is available.<br><br>The other thing (beyond simple base AB) is the choice of your weapon.  The cleric would either have to use a feat OR take a rogue level pre-epic, losing another AB.  For PvM or just playability, that is probably ok.  But for the real fun, fighting at 40, hard to swallow.  <br><br>I think the answer is above, though: Paladin 18 Weaponmaster 19 (where you get the holy triumvirate of epic feats (EWF, AS, and EP) and Rogue 3.

I'm still just not seeing the point of Paladin unless you're going to pump Charisma. Cleric gives you a lot more buffs than just AB and damage, and unless you have Charisma it tends to be worth more than paladin.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

Higher AB unbuffed. Power to buff to +13 on his own, plus any ability stats. A cleric can buff to up to +20 in some cases, but counting lower BAB and heavier investment into WIS which costs you more AB and damage even. Then a Pally get Taunt and the odds are changing here. Now start counting the dispel-on-hit and the cleric swiftly starts to hang dangerously far behind. Take into the account your greater crit range OR multiplier from a martial weapon and darn.<br><br> You will find arguments for going cleric instead, mainly healing, but don't say PAL isn't a good choice with the strong-points I made above. I have played a few both Clerics and Pally's, and the pally is the hardest hitter, and he is done with his short-term buffs in a round or two, all depending on his equipment.<br><br>Pally isn't useless here, it's not like cleric totally outshines it and makes it worthless in this combo. No way. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>
