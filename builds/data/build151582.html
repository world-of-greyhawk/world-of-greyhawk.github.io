Maybe it would be better to go with 4 fighter and go ranger 23 for an extra favored enemy?  You can pick up weapon spec and epic weapon spec on a feat level... though you'd have to drop a great dex (and might as well drop two, perhaps picking up epic prowess to make up for the AB loss?).  It's a tough call, but might be one way to squeek out a bit of extra damage, and to a wider range of enemies.<br>_________________<br>"Intelligence is knowing a tomato is a fruit; Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad."

Hmmm might work, but I think you need at least 4 Fighter for Weapon Spec, which means you'd need at least 5 Fighter for EWS, so I don't think I could get it and still take 23 lvls of Ranger.  If I could, though, it might be worth it.

Not quite.  You need 4 levels of fighter for weapon specialization, and for epic weapon specialization.<br><br>The soonest you can get both is 24th level.  Take Epic Weapon Focus at 21, then on 24th take your 4th fighter level.  On that level you should be able to pick weapon spec and epic weapon spec.  If you take your fighter levels post 20, you can use the bonus feats for epic weapon focus and such.  It's a little tricky to time, but I've done it before successfully.<br>_________________<br>"Intelligence is knowing a tomato is a fruit; Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad."

Ahhhh ok didn't know that you could get Epic Weapon Spec with only 4 lvls of Fighter.  Good to know, maybe I will incorporate it into some of my builds.

I am just curious, you mentioned 16 Ranger / 4 rogue for pre epic.  How do you get to a BAB of 29 with those levels?  I am trying this build and didnt go quite the same, since I chose 2 fighter pre epic, and I only have 20 BAB.  Something tells me I broke the build somehow.

Add the 10 BAB that everyone gets in epic levels brings it up to 29.  I assume your 20 BAB is pre-epic, since only pure mages or maybe really badly multiclassed 3/4 classes can get 10 BAB pre-epic.  A pre-epic BAB of 20 can only be accomplished by taking all warrior classes, in this case, ranger and fighter.  To get a pre-epic BAB of 20, with 2 fighter levels, you must have gone Ranger 18/Fighter 2.  I have no idea how this will screw with feat progression, but at lvl 40, you will have BAB 30, so feat not on that front.<br>_________________<br>Epic Character Builders:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>
