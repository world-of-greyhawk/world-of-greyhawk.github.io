This is a build that was inspired by Grizzled Dwarflord's "The Incredible Fighting Rogue of War" <br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "206501", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> <br><br>"Inspired" may not be the best word, since this build is pretty much a straightforward copy of his character's build. The only original pieces I brought were the feats since my version is Strength-based and his is Dex-based.<br><br>I was intrigued by his build and wondered how it would turn out as a strength-based brutal thug...thus was born the Thug of Torm.<br><br><b>Thug of Torm</b><br><br><b>Playable from 1-40, designed for PvM</b><br><br>Classes:	Rogue 20/Fighter 6/CoT 24	<br>Race:	Dwarf	<br>Alignment:	Chaotic Neutral	<br><br>Stats	(start/finish)	<br>Str	16/30	<br>Dex	15/16	<br>Con	16	<br>Int	14	<br>Wis	8	<br>Cha	6	<br><br>1	Rogue 1	Strong Soul<br>2	Rogue 2	<br>3	Fighter 1	Wpn Focus: Greatsword, *Knockdown<br>4	Fighter 2	(Dex: 16) *Expertise<br>5	Fighter 3	<br>6	Fighter 4	Toughness, *Wpn Spec: Greatsword<br>7	Rogue 3	<br>8	Fighter 5	(Str: 17)<br>9	CoT 1	Imp.

just a few questions.<br><br>what armor would you suggest wearing?  plate?  why raise dex to 16?  i presume for the +1 to dex-related skills, unless you wear lighter armor?  in which case, are you still going to be sneaking around? you forgot to mention that under skills then.  you could take ESF in hide and move silently to make up for when you are wearing plate.<br><br>i like this take on the strength-based rogue, but without the stealthy aspect, it feels more like a fighter with some rogue abilities.  is this how you would play it, or would you still recommend using this char more like a rogue, perhaps using UMD for invis. scrolls?<br><br>just curious what the best way to play this hard-hitting rogue is.  very nice build by the way.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"You cannot pass!"

I think there are 2 reasons to get his Dex to 16.  One is to give his Rogue skills a fighting chance.  The other is to give him a choice in Armors to wear.  If the situation warrants, and he has the appropriate items/buffs, he should be able to get the same AC in padded armor or Robes as he would in Full plate.  This is exactly how I prefer to make my Assassins: strength-based but yet still a small commitment to Dexterity to provide for ultimate flexibility at all levels.<br><br>I am flattered, Kaliban.  Once again it is demonstrated with facts and figures that Dwarves make the best Rogues.  My only suggestion in a strength-version would be to squeeze in some Stealth skill foci somewhere, perhaps in dropping the Disarm or Expertise feats, and sticking in some ESFs in place of Slippery and Epic Toughness.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 08/31/05 16:26</span></i></p>

Christian, thanks for the compliments, but full credit goes to the Dwarflord. <br><br>As for how to play this character, I'm actually playing him in the HotU OC right now (Nostalgia called, what can I say?) and he's brutally efficient. I'm playing him as a plate-wearing tank with rogue skills -- I wanted a lock picker/trap disarmer with the nifty Rogue bonus skills and feats (Tumble, UMD, Sneak Attack, Crippling Strike, etc). For that reason I neglected to bring up his stealth skills - my Thug isn't quite as refined as Grizz's Rogue o' War. As Grizz suggests (and he created in his build) flexibility is attained with the 16 Dex and then Epic Skill Focii in Hide and Move Silently.<br><br>On a PW or with this character in a different role in another single-player Mod I would follow Grizz's advice and build in the stealth skills as he advises. Actually, after reading Grizz's response above, I decided that after I finish the OC -- if I choose to play this character in other epic mods -- I will de-level him and relevel him in a trainer, taking advantage of the advice in Grizz's post.<br><br>For full details on why a Dex of 16, read Grizz's excellent post and playing guide for The Deathstroke (assassin): <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "208029", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Grizz, you present solid advice (not surprising since this is effectively a hijacked build of yours <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> ), thanks for the input.<br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br>Have fun storming the castle!
