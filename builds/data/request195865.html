I would like to make a build that has crip.strike, E-dodge, good sneak dmg, high dex, maxed hide/ms+feats, good archer and can go melee. It has to be the 3 specific classes because otherwise the server i play on will not allow a player to lock pick. To max potential i don't know how many lvls of each class is need. Although i have to say that at least 3 SD lvls is needed as for assasin as well. Maybe Assasin could be left out but it gets grt dex bonus feats. any ideas would be wonderful.
