Since I had yet to see a build which made use of the wonderful Oozemaster class, I decided to create one.  What you get is a completely crit immune and sneak immune dragon with 40/- DR, that can cast 9th lvl Cleric and Druid spells in human form.  <br><br>Due to the Intuitive Attack feat he gets a decent AB with his Scimitar, especially with Cleric buffs.  With a combination of Cleric and Druid buffs (mostly Cleric), he can boost his AB by a whopping 23-24 points, which is enough to allow him to break 60 AB in Human form. <br><br> In dragon form he loses 8 AB due to the fact that he doesn't get the Weapon Focus feats and his weapon enhancement doesn't merge, but you gain +9 due to having 48 base Str, so you actually come out a point ahead, meaning that you can get up to 63 AB with this build.  <br><br>Although you don't get the Improved Knockdown feat, you're an ancient Dragon with a +63 AB, so you should still be able to knock some people down, and with 17 Druid levels your breath weapon should be able to do some damage too.        <br><br>Oozy the Dragon<br><br>Druid 17/Cleric 17/Oozemaster 6<br>(pre-epic Druid 8/Cleric 8/Oozemaster 4)<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Alignment: Neutral Good<br><br>Domains: Trickery and Travel<br><br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 13<br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 14 <br>Wis 17<br>Cha 8<br><br>9 points into Wis, last point into Str<br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 14<br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 14 <br>Wis 30<br>Cha 8<br><br><br>Feats<br><br>1 Power Attack, Cleave<br>3 Intuitive Attack<br>6 Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>9 Great Fortitude<br>12 Extend Spell <br>15 Knockdown<br>18 Great Cleave<br>21 Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>24 Great Wis I<br>27 Great Wis II<br>30 Great Wis III<br>33 Great Wis IV<br>36 Dragon Shape <br>39 Epic Skill Focus: Discipline<br><br><br>Epic lvl progression:<br><br>21-22 Oozemaster<br>23-30 Cleric<br>31-38 Druid<br>39-40 Cleric<br><br>Equipment:<br><br>Full Plate<br>Tower Shield<br>Scimitar<br><br><br>Skills:  <br><br>Concentration: 43<br>Discipline:    31<br>Heal:          43<br>Lore:          43<br>Spellcraft:    43 <br>Tumble:        21<br><br><br>Total: 267 skill credits (10 left over)<br><br>AB: 25 base<br>    +10 Wis<br>    +1 WF<br>    +2 EWF<br>    ______<br>    38 w/ mundane Scimitar<br><br>AC: 10 base<br>    -1 Dex<br>    +8 Full Plate<br>    +3 Tower Shield<br>    +4 Tumble<br>    ______<br>    24 AC naked and unbuffed<br><br>HP: 400 max unbuffed (in human form)

Edit: it actually turns out that the Intuitive Attack feat does not work with Scimitar, as it is not a simple or natural weapon.  <br><br>Thus, rather than taking WF in Scimitar, you will probably want to take it in something else, like Spear, Staff, or Sickle if you want to use a shield.

Funny I made a build pretty similar to this the other day.<br><br>For WP focus I would suggest Morningstar (that was what I used anyway).
