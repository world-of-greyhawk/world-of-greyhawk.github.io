Wow, you get a powerful item as bonus for taking a powerful feat? well that's weird but let's take advantage of that I guess.<br><br>Well, Stun or Knockdown seems the best choices for a sneaker IMO, since they make the enemy prone, the important thing would be to know what determines the DCs on such items and take the one which DC is high enough to work a lot, because I would think the stun aura is the best but a stun DC on a DEX based build sounds low in my mind.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

The thing is that if you can't get Epic Dodge then taking off Defensive Roll does sound like a good idea. As I said before, your bold Knockdown or Stun Aura depend on what factors affect its DC and if it will be good enough to work, if not, take more DEX or Improved Sneak Attack.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/11/08 22:57</span></i></p>
