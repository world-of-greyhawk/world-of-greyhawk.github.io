I was wondering about this...<br><br>What is the best fortitude save against the devestating critical in order to avoid to be slain?<br><br>And what are the factors that determines this?<br><br>So, basically my question is this. What is the highest fortitude save that is required in order to avoid the death by devastating critical of any form, of any outside interference(ie; enchanted weapons by wizards), of any thing that helps the devastating criticals?<br><br>I am not sure if this made any sense.<br><br>The reason I asked is that I am working on a AI script that would make it challenging enough, enough that the character would have to resort to something else to kill the creature. Same thing goes with the IGMs.<br><br>And second reason is that I wanted to know if it was possible to make build that can defeat the devastating criticals without being immune to it or have high AC. Just dependant on the fortitude saves itself.<br><br>Thank you in advance for any help with this.<br><br>Anuis

I agree... I wish that they did make a feat or immunity type that makes them immune to devastating critical only, but can be harmed by overwhelming critical or lesser type criticals. But with the information that you provided, it should be enough to be able to avoid being killed by devastating critical enough to make the fight challenging, even for the weapon master type builds.

Well this topic brings up something very interesting concerning the savings throws. I'm playing with a character on a server that currenlty has a dev crit of 41. When I go to kill this boss monster it has a fortitude just high enough so that it has to roll a 1 for it to fail it's save. I have killed this boss monster plenty of times and only twice has it rolled a 1. So basically I have to kill it the old fashioned way.<br><br>Now here is my second point concerning savings throws. With the same character I'll be lvling him up against monsters that cast finger of death (at least i think it's the finger of death). Anyways the only way I can die from it is if I roll a 1. Throughout fighting these monsters I will constantly roll 1's resulting in my character dying.<br><br>So what I'm getting at is that I've noticed that any save towards a spell that causes instant death is more likely to roll a 1 than say rolling a 20 to hit a high AC or against the dev crit like I stated above. It seems to me that the supposedly random number generated between 1 and 20 is a little biased. Has anyone else seen this problem like I have?

This is a common complaint, and misconception. The RNG is fine (has been shown to be so); ironically, you can look at the stream of numbers coming out of an RNG, and in isolation, they can seem to be non-random.  Its just natural for the human mind to attempt to see patterns in any stream of data ("Oh look, it just rolled a 4, 5, 6 in sequence!") but in reality, you are being fooled because you arent looking at ENOUGH data to show its really random.<br>_________________<br>Normal kids play rock-paper-scissors.<br>Shifter kids play IronGolem-RustMonster-MindFlayer. . .

Ive done enough tests on epic dodge to see that the rng produces an equal number of 1s,2s,3s, and so on. <br><br>In fact i dont think I have had a test that has been over at least 100 rolls that didnt come within a few percent of what should have been expected. <br><br>Syrath
