Also, the Bard Song ability won't work until level 18 when he gets the Charisma+2 bonus for RDD.<br>* With Power Attack, Expertise, Improved Disarm, Improved Knockdown, and Fire-Breathing, you have a lot of choices to best suit the battle you're in.<br>* With Devastating Critical, a Strength of 34, and Great Cleave, you'll make short work of most opponents that aren't critical immune (like undead).<br>* With a total discipline of 65, opponents will have a hard time getting called shot, disarm, and knockdown to work on you.<br>* Thanks to a Constitution of 22 and three levels of Damage Reduction, you're tough to kill.<br>* With the right mix of magic items(around +5) you can get your AB and AC into the 50s.<br>* WIth 25 ranks in Use Magic Device, you can use just about any scroll, rod, wand, etc. you find.<br>* Stat Boosting Items: Strength would be the first choice to help AB, Damage, and Discipline. Constitution for more HPs and a better Fortitude save.<br>* His saves vs spells are good thanks to 40 ranks in Spellcraft, but his regular saves are average. Items that boost universal saves would help him in that department.<br>* I put 11 ranks into Search &amp; Spot to help find hidden creatures, secret doors, and traps. Those skill points were leftover, so they can be used elsewhere.<br>* This is a HotU adaption of a draconic PnP character I had - Drego the Unlucky (his ability to break bowstrings and shatter swords in battle was nigh-legendary).<br>_________________<br>"Only two things in the world are infinite, the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not quite sure about the former." -Albert Einstein<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 02:40</span></i></p>
