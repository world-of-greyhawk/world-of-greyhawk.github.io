I've used the character search engine, and there are a few, but not exactly what I want.<br><br>AA would be nice, but not necessary.  It's probably pretty hard to make a high CHA, divine damaging archer using AA.  Then again, it's hard to have an AB in the 60's or better without AA.<br><br>Any suggestions?<br><br>Oh, and PrC consortium classes can be used as well.

A cleric 23/Bard 2/AA 15 sounds pretty good, but the actual feats I haven't worked out.

Cleric 9 / Bard 4 / AA 27 works bettter.<br>Follow an 8/4/8 Template pre-epic to manage 17 BAB which is nice for an AA, and gives 4 attacks. Final BAB - 27. Also has access to the ever essential level 4 cleric buffs (too much sacrifice for lvl 5). Memorizations would probably includs Bless, Aid, Endurace, Eagle's Splendor, Darkfire (if it works on ranged), prayer, Divine Power. Take strength and War domains.<br><br>Stats<br>Str - 8<br>Dex - 18<br>Con - 12<br>Wis - 14<br>Int - 10<br>Cha - 14<br><br>Take all Dex at lvls 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40<br>Take in order: Epic Prowess, Armor Skin*, Great Dex (5 times)<br>AA Feats in order: Epic Focus, Great Dex (3 Times)<br>*Can be swapped for Epic energy Resistance: Fire I to fight clerics<br><br>This puts us up to 36 dex by lvl 40. Final AB calculations:<br><br>BAB - 27<br>EA* - 14<br>Fts -  5<br>DEX - 13 (higher buffed)<br>------------------------<br>AB  - 59 UNBUFFED<br><br>*Enchant Arrow<br><br>Add cleric buffs:<br>Prayer 1<br>Bless  1<br>D.P*   3<br>Aid    1<br>CG*    1<br>---------<br>Bonus  7<br><br>Buffed AB - 66:evillol:, 63 After 9 rounds, 60 after 9 minutes, 59 after 9 hours.<br><br>AC:<br>10<br>13<br> 2<br> 4<br>--<br>26 Naked unbuffed AC<br><br>Buffed AC<br>10<br>14<br> 2<br> 4<br> 2<br>--<br>29 Naked Buffed AC<br><br>On Antiworld (+5 max on all items exept save rings)<br>your best AC would be<br>10<br>19 (+12 items)<br> 2<br> 4<br> 4<br> 5<br> 5<br> 5<br>---<br>54 Fully Buffed AC for 4 rounds (Nymph Cloak +4 used, If I added Epic Helm of Persuasion it could go up to +8 enhancement to CHA and thus +6 to AC over 6 rounds, but as such...)<br><br>This is of course requiring featsm which i am not going to work out or you. You need Focus, P.B.S, Rapid Shot, Toughness, and I Reccomend Extra Turning. You have to sacrifice Called Shot and Improved Critical to gain your Divine Shield feat, which is a small loss of effectiveness, So I reccomend taking feats in this order:<br>(Bard 4 is first)<br>P.B.S (point blank)<br>Focus<br>Exra Turning (2 cleric)<br>Power Atk (5 cleric)<br>Divine Sheild (8 cleric)<br>Rapid Shot<br>Toughness<br><br>Alternatively you could sacrifice extra turning in favor of improved critical (Depends on ideology - PvP do it, PvM, don't its less resting)<br><br>Level up order:<br><br>*Pre-Epic*<br>Bard 4<br>Cleric 8<br>AA 8<br>***Epic***<br>Cleric 1<br>AA 19<br><br>Damage would be <br>1d8+14 (19-20x3 if you took Imp crit)<br>+1d6 +4 Fire Damage<br>For a total of 18.5 phys/hit + 7.5 Fire/hit<br>26 Damage per hit on average.<br>Crtical Average will be 78.<br><br>Hope I helped. I am posting this same build onto the Epic Builds section, it will be there under the name "Godstricken Archer."<br><br>-Freedom
