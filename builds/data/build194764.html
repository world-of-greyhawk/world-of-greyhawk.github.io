<b>PvM build</b><br>This is designed as an unarmed ninja-type for a PW I play on.

You can reduce your shadowdancer levels by 5 and increase either rogue or monk for a bonus feat (at rogue 13 or monk 25).<br><br>Shadowdancer above 5 gives you<br><br>Level 7 slippery mind (made redundant since a monk is immune to mind spells)<br>Level 10 Improved Evasion (also gained at level 9 monk)<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

I wish I could, but like I said, the PW is moving HIPS to SD 10, and I want HIPS, so I kinda have to have those 5 "extra" levels <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">

<!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 05/12/05 07:35:06 (GMT) -- InsaneShadow<br>+5d6 +2 Sneak Attack<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Just a note...I think you are misunderstanding what crippling strike does (at least I think that's where you're getting that +2 from).  It doesn't give you 2 extra points of damage on your sneak attack.  It deals +2 of strength ability damage on a successful sneak attack.  In other words, it lowers your opponent's strength by 2.  It's quite a bit more powerful than I think you were expecting.<br><br>Oh, and for setting traps, the epic traps have set DCs of 65.  Below those though, the highest DC is for a deadly gas trap, which is 45.<br><br>Steve

*rubs toe in the dirt sheepishly* Yeah, I noticed that after I posted... had to drop Crippling Blow in another build and actually read the description that time. Thanks for pointing that out <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>Hrm. Well, there's no way I'm going to pull off disarming epic traps, so I guess I can drop it down even more to just pull off 45, and move those points to something else. Nifty! Thanks!
