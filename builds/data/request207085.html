I have searched and searched, and just can't seem to find a build that utilizes monk/cleric/dwd.  I was kind of thinking something along the lines of cleric 15(for maxed buffs), and either dwd14/monk11 or dwd18/monk7.  Not sure if this is the optimal way to build this, or if this would even be a good build at all.  I was just kind of thinking that you could use the cleric to buff AB (of course), monk for many-attacks and some speed, and obviously dwarven defender would be to stoke up the defense.  <br><br>Anyone know of or seen a build like this?  If not, I'll take a crack at it and post it in the epic build forum, but didn't want to re-invent the wheel.
