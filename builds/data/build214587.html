Nice war druid, and it's great to see a non-shifter Druid. I ran this class combo through pulse cap's search and it looks like you have the first post of one.<br><br><i>It's always a nice touch to add spell and strategy suggestions.</i><br><br>Nice job!<br><br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br><i>This space for rent</i>

Yay druids.  An underrated and underused class, except as a stepping stone to shifter.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Nice build... suggest use the scitmar as the melee weapon, the best to choose from and it just RPs so well. I've got to see how this does with a sling and shield.

Bioware doesn't seem to love Druids very much <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  . Clerics have the better quality spells AND they can get access to some of the best Druid's spells (Creeping Doom, Aura of Vitality, and Stoneskin plus they can get other buffs, bonus feats every 3 levels vs every 4 post epic). Power difference if restricted to level 20 is bearable but after level 40, well what can I say (your animal companion's AC will never be all that great)... (No need to even try to get great AB and AC as a near-pure Cleric *cough* overpowered divine power spell *cough*) meh :/.<br><br>Glad you guys like the build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  . It's rather feat starved - I wanted to go for caster level 32 but it means dropping a feat &gt;_&gt;. As for that melee weapon, I was thinking dagger not really scim lol.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Jennalee on 09/30/05 01:19</span></i></p>

You lose a little HP, -2 from all saves and one general feat (no KD nor, Armor Skin). You can ditch Dragon Shape if you want (it's there because you CAN get it and it'd be fun =P) perhaps for an Epic Spell and move the Greater Spell Focus up.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Jennalee on 09/30/05 02:14</span></i></p>

I've always been able to RP clerics much more effectively than druids (I enjoy the moral dilemnas that often occur playing an LG cleric, for instance), but I totally agree that clerics get spoiled in terms of abilities.  In fact, with each new issue of the DnD rules clerics just get more and more powerful.  They've always been the kings of buffing and healing (not to mention rezzing), but with the advent of domain powers now they can be part-mage, part-fighter, extra mini-feats, etc.  Being able to wear heavy armor, getting most of the best long-lasting AB buffs in the game..while they may be somewhat balanced against the powerhouses that fighters have become, it's difficult not to agree that the druid is left out in the cold (so to speak). <br><br>I might try this build out, though, simply to see if I can find something that I like better than my long-time favorite class.<br>_________________<br>Favorite PW's: Hall of the Worlds, Higher Ground, World of Iniquity.
