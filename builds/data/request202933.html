i got the idea for this build but i dont know how to implement it, i think ranger is my favourite class for a rplay server as it has decent attack capability combined with some interesting rplay options.<br><br>my idea was to make a ranger/dwarven defender....<br><br>its for a low magic world which is PvP based rplay ...eg choose a side where you start and defend/attack the enemy side when you have to<br><br>One thing i do want is devastating critical to kill off the enemy side quickly and effectively...if any builds like this have been posted a pointer in the right direction would be great as i didnt have time to properly search the 20 odd pages of build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">
