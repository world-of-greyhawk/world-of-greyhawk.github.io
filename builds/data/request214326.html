Uncanny dodge , how does it work ? i know it is to keep your dex ac even when flat-footed but when are you flatfooted . I know one is when you are attacked while you are inactive, something like a sneak. so any other times ? being attacked by multiple enemies , the one you facing will be dealing with the full ac with the rest getting you flat-footed ? i am new so i still dont quite get how the uncanny dodge work yet besides what is written on the book <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>thanks for anyone that can help me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">
