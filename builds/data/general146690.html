Someone mentioned in my original post that a Monk would not be able to fit in this build due to feats.<br><br>I haven't attempted to build it it, I'm still searching to see if someone ahs one already. The reason for Monk at a decent level would be for the extra speed and deflect arrows.<br><br>A monk archer with massive speed that is.

Pre-requisite for Epic dodge<br><br>Improved Evasion (level 9 monk , level 10 Shadowdancer or rogue bonus feat). You can meet the prereq with monk<br>Defensive Roll (level 5 Shadowdancer, or rogue bonus feat). Monk  is unable to get this without multiclassing<br><br>However if you have a monk/shadowdancer or a monk/rogue multiclass you cannot have an arcane archer since you need an arcane spellcasting class in there. (unless you play on a server where this is disabled).<br><br>You can still get Self Concealment. This would be very difficult to get since you would have to follow something like this<br><br>DEX 20 <br><br>Level 4 DEX 21<br>Level 8 DEX 22<br>Level 12 DEX 23<br>Level 16 DEX 24<br>Level 20 DEX 25(level 10 monk, level 1 wiz, level 9 AA) <br>Level 21 Great DEX 26<br>Level 24 DEX 27, Great DEX 28 <br>Level 25 Great DEX 29(AA bonus feat) <br>We are now at level 14 AA,Level 1 Wiz, Level 10 monk<br>Level 27 Great DEX 30<br>Level 30 Self Concealment 1 <br>Level 33 Self Concealment 2<br>Level 36 Self Concealment 3<br>Level 39 Self Concealment 4<br>Level 40 Self Concealment 5 Level 25 monk bonus feat<br><br>So we now have level 25 monk, level 14 AA, Level 1 wiz<br><br>Not too bad a build , however you will notice a severe lack of any other feats other than Great DEX and Self concealment. <br><br>Believe me when I say Epic dodge does more for avoidance than SC 5 does. In this case however I would level up AA instead and have to stop with Self concealment 4. At least that way you will get a bit more AA bonus feats(level 18 , 22 and 26) and have level 29 AA, Level 1 Wiz, Level 10 monk. Which is a much more offensive combination, but lacks the defense of a ED, SC 5 archer <br><br>Syrath

Actualy, I still like the idea of the monk 25 though, with incredible running speed on an archer, chances of being hit will wither down as well. No?

Thanks for the input, however, the goal of the archer is to support. Now we are left with your ideas of offensiveness on a support core char versus my idea of trying to figure out a near impossible to hit char with good support capabilities.<br><br>I like survivability, and I am sure as not a soloer in PVP situations, I am team oriented. If the team survives, I survive.<br><br>With massive monk speed and decent damage I couple with the concealments I would guess the char near impossible to strike. On the small chances the archer would get caught by a melee char the Epic Dodge combined with Self Concealment will give it a guaranteed 1 hit free escape and hopefully 2-3 on the Self concealment. With the monk speed and haste the archer could easily dust off the melee attacker and retreat to other forces.<br><br>And then continue to picking off the character from afar.<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>As for mages, the concealment should be it's only defense, and even then is still quite impressive with 50% chance of spells missing.<br><br>Your pure offensive versus Hit and Run. I suppose it would all come down to a play style in the end however.

Fighter/rogue/monk <br><br>This causes a problem with the xp penalty since if you do x Monk/x rogue/ 6 fighter. You will have to alternate rogue and monk levels.

The int is for skill points yes, the wis is for saves you could distribute them another way. <br><br>You need to at least get your hide to 30 by the time you get Self concealment.

So basicaly this archer is a near impossible to catch by melee, near impossible to hit whenever they do since the 1 in 20 or 1 in 40 rounds hit ratio. Can be considered immune to critical hits as you say (how come?). Immune to anything reflex saves (i would guess) and then only Wisdom save or Fort save spells can harm him, aye?<br><br>What would you guess the saves on this type of char?<br><br>Oh yeah, and this char wouldn't be Knockable since 2 discipline skill feats and maxed disc would prevent him from being knocked down.

Then the critical confirmation roll comes next. Highest you can roll is a 20, but a 20 on the confirmation roll is <i>not</i> an automatic crit.

He rolls a 20 for 64. 20 is an automatic hit, so he hits you. Then the confirmation roll comes up 20 as well for another total of 64. However, this is not high enough to hit 65 AC because a 20 on the <i>confirmation</i> roll is not an automatic crit. Ergo, you're crit-immune.

...Someone tried the Rogue/Wiz/AA and that didn't work out to well. Even with corrections, it wasn't all that good. Monk and Rogue don't need to be in the same build unless you are getting one level so you can use other monk like skills. Both Rogue and Monk get access to Evasion/Imp Evasion, but Rogue is the only one who can get access to Defensive Roll.<br><br>...Use the Puck build as a referrence, but instead of knockdown, weapon focus/epic weapon focus: shortsword, weapon specialization/epic weapon specialization: Shortsword, improve critical: short sword and improve knockdown, you pick point blank shot, rapid shot, weapon focus/epic weapon focus: shortbow, improve critical shortbow, weapon specialization/epic weapon specialization: Shortbow.<br><br>...With HIPs, you can cast most of your enemies by surprise.<br>_________________<br>Which Stick are you?<br><a href="http://www.ihateyour.com/cgi-bin/bbs/YaBB.cgi?action=games;game=Stuntexperience" target="_blank">Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrPaladin on 08/10/04 03:52</span></i></p>

Base 34 AC,<br><br>Ring of Protection +5<br>Amulet of natural Armour +5<br>Robe of the Dark Moon +4 due to haste<br>Bracers of Armour +5<br>Boots of the sun Soul+5<br><br>Since he is a bowman cant use a shield anyway (and would lose monk bonus if he did)<br><br>So yes 58 AC is accurate.

I got to 60 AC with max of +5 items on armor and dex and wis.<br><br>60 ac. It's high, but I don;t think that is immune to crits since some fighter builds get to 60+ bab easily.

Yes, usually when I build like this I usually would prefer to have access to a shield and improved expertise which can boost your AC by 18 pts. (+5 items)<br><br>However, it should still serve you well pvm and against more average AB. Even against a fighter with 5 attacks per round if 5 attacks hit then first one misses, other 2 miss due to SC. so only 2/5 of the attacks hit in this case.<br><br>Syrath

So if the ratio is 40% hit. If each hit is 50 damage, at 10 con on this build I was around 220 HP at level 40.<br><br>Thats 100 dmg per round to kill this char. 3 rounds and this char is dead. Take away SC and EDodge and imagine 4 of 5 hit then that would be 200 per round. so again, 3 rounds to kill a 500-600 HP fighter.<br><br>The hit ratio PLEASE must be lower then 2 of 5 hit. It just gotta!<br><br>Now, to be Crit immune vs a fighter. Usualy they have from 55 to 75 Bab, that means armor of 76 to 86 is needed to be immune to that?<br><br>My ac was merely 60. 70 if Imp Expertise is on, but that isn't usefull since the archer is incredibly fast and will probably not be caught by any fighter if you ask me.

I cannot tell you what the hit ratio is but i will try to give some examples based on 4 attacks per round<br><br>require 20 to hit roughly 1 hit every 40 rounds (effect of epic dodge alone btw)<br><br>Require 19 to hit = 1/10 chance to hit once , 3/10 chance to hit with rest of attacks so 3/100 chance to get hit or 3 hits in 25 rounds (roughly 1 hit every 8 rounds)<br><br>Require 18 to hit = 3/20 chance to hit once, 9/20 chance to hit with rest of attacks. so 27 hits every 400 attacks. Roughly 1 hit every 4 rounds<br><br>Require 17 to hit = 1/5 chance to hit once 12/20 chance to land second hit.  12 hits every 100 attacks. Rougly 1 hit every 2 rounds<br><br>... Require 2 to hit = 19/20 chance to hit once and 57/20 chance to hit a second time. = 2.5 hits per round<br><br>These are approximations the exact calculations are much more complex than this and would take pages.<br><br>Now compare this without Epic dodge<br>20 to hit = 1 hit every 5 rounds = 8 * more damage <br>19 to hit = 1 hit every 2.5 rounds = 4 * more damage<br>18 to hit = 1 hit every 2 rounds = 2 * more damage<br>2 to hit = 4 hits per round = 1.6 * more damage.<br><br>This is before the effects  of self concealment<br><br>Which halfs the damage taken (except with blind fight fighters which is 25 percent reduction in damage)<br><br>So <br>20 to hit = 1/16 of the damage you would take normally<br>19 to hit = 1/8 of the damage you would take normally<br>18 to hit = 1/4 of the damage you would take normally<br>...<br>2 to hit = 1/3 of the damage you would take normally.<br><br>These are examples of a fight one on one with a fighter with 4 attacks. <br><br>This reduction in damage gives you that time to run out of range. <br><br>As you can see though the greatest effect is where there is the possibility to get your AC that high. <br><br>I find it strange though that you are quoting an AB of 75 for melee with items restricted as you say. <br><br>Take 50 AB ( very good for a naked melee fighter IMO). Add in +5 for enchantment gives +55. Add in some strength and there isnt much more (this is for a strength of around 30 and at level 40 with +5 items)<br><br>How they get an AB 20 higher than this I dont know considering that +20 is the highest enchantment/buff you can get on attack.SO I would say 70 AB with really good buffs and some +5 weapons.<br><br>Syrath
