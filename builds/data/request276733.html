Hey guys. First off thank you all immensely for taking the time to read and/or post in this thread. I'm the kinda guy that watches the forums mostly and doesnt post.<br><br>As far as the guild goes - Its liberating to see such a guild work together and produce such fine builds.<br><br>Now my dilemma.<br><br>I could lie and say i'm a mediocre builder but i'm not. I'm more of the kind of builder that couldnt tell his devastating criticals from his expertise modes. =]<br><br>So I come to you, the gods and goddesses of the NWN world <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>I'd like a melee character thats good aligned. I don't mind the make up of the build but I would like the following:<br><br>~Moderatly high AC<br>~Able to actually hit other enemies unlike my builds<br>~Moderatly high AB<br>~Sword and board<br><br>As I said I really do not mind the make up of the build as long as it is not evil aligned =]and also no caster levels, explicitly sorc/wiz/druid/cleric. Bard is alright without exceeding 13 levels. Ranger/paladin is acceptable<br><br>I realise that for high AC it may have to be a dexterity based build and i'm fine with that =] I'd really just like a build which  can really hold its own in PvP/PvM and can take out most meleers =]<br><br>Now as far as the posting goes for the build - Can it be in the easiest to read format, the agreed format put down by the moderators. I can't follow them otherwise heh heh.<br><br>I think thats all except from the details of the world this character will be involved in so here goes<br><br>~+5 Items at best ((Some high rank faction gear gets otherwise))<br>~Caster builds are common but dont take part in the PvP<br>~PM/RDD are seen as evil<br>~SD levels must be taken more than +3<br>~Most meleers have dev crit but thats not a requirement for this build<br>~Highest stat boosting equipment is 4 on any item I believe<br><br><br><br>I think thats all. Err thank you all so much<br><br><br><br>As a side note, the description will contain Kudos to the builder and if it is easier the build can be PM'd to me =]<br><br><br>Thanks sooo much

If you can't take any caster except Bard, I suppose you'll think a Weapon Master to have low AC... because WM is so useful when you want AB with no caster levels.<br><br>Man, no caster levels, I always make Cerics, Druid dragons and Dwarven Defenders in such low environments, I've got my <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "265734", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Woodland Dwarf (Ranger 22 / Fighter 4 / Dwarven Defender 14)</a> which has a nice defense and damage for both PvP and PvM, with a decent AB but not really considered to be high, being a Dwarven Defender you already have to be lawful, perhaps you'll like it...

Best melee'ers for your server are, with strength, usually 12 fighter / 25 wm / 3 rogue, <br> 11/ 28/ 1 bard(or whatever), <br>or 14/ 25/ 1. I think you can imagine how those are made, all of those get dev crit.<br><br>They are fairly good at PvP, especially on your server, but, dexers are much much better at PvP, but they're extreamly hard to play on the server. Mostly because PvM happens more than PvP, and dexers aren't able to dish out enough damage to kill things fast enough to save lives and yadda yadda.<br><br>Those builds that I mentioned, their AB gets to around 62 or 63, and if you manage to get a Heron Marked Blade, those are +8 swords <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   (I think I just gave your server away! &gt;_&gt; )<br>Their AC with all +5 items is...57 I believe, and with high ranking faction armor you can get it into the 60s. But, your main goal is to dev crit the other guy before he dev crits you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    So you usually want Great and Epic Fortitude. <br><br>If you are going dexer, look up some builds, there are plenty. One of the best is 11 Fighter / 19 WM / 10 SD. I know someone who was playing that build on your server, and he took out like 3 or 4 str builds at once in a tournament. I made a char with the same build, yeah it was pretty good. Epic Dodge, AC around 65, AB is 61, I think it's posted in the forums somewhere. <br><br>However, damage is mediocre, you rely on your critical hits, and as you know, many things are immune to critical hits on your server, and dexers simply don't deal enough damage to be useful in Epic level hunting grounds. <br><br>Sooo....Up to you!<br><br>EDIT!: Also, all of those builds are sword and shield. Weapon of choice for dexers is of course, the Rapier, but for the str builds, you can basically take whichever weapon you want for RP purposes, or scimitar/rapier for better crit ratio. <br><br>An old DM from your server made this build, and it's pretty good. Uses a greatsword incase you wanna go two handed. <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "191493", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>A better option to that build is making all of your stats 14 to start, and wear cloth armor. Bad things about it though, are, it's super gear reliant, and less strength, but, if you can get your dex and wisdom up with faction gear or whatever, it gets a higher AC than fullplate users. Hope I helped! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Endalyor on 06/21/07 14:36</span></i></p>
