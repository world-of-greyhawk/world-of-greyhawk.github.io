This is actually a revision of a character I created a while back, but since it uses a different class mix I thought I would repost it.  <br><br>Dragon Slinger<br><br>Rogue 10/Druid 15/Cleric 15<br>(pre-epic Rogue 4/Druid 4/Cleric 12)<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Domains: Trickery and Travel<br><br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 13<br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 10 <br>Wis 18<br>Cha 8<br><br>9 points into Wis, last point into Str<br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 14<br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 10 <br>Wis 30<br>Cha 8<br><br>1 Point Blank Shot, Toughness<br>3 Zen Archery <br>6 Weapon Focus: Sling<br>9 Extend Spell <br>12 Great Fortitude <br>15 Knockdown<br>18 Improved Knockdown<br>21 Epic Weapon Focus: Sling<br>24 Great Wis I<br>27 Great Wis II<br>30 Great Wis III<br>33 Epic Fortitude<br>35 Improved Evasion *<br>36 Epic Skill Focus: Discipline<br>39 Dragon Shape <br><br>* Rogue bonus feat<br><br><br>Equipment:<br><br>Full Plate<br>Tower Shield<br>Sling<br><br><br>Skills:  <br><br>Concentration: 43<br>Discipline: 31<br>Heal: 43<br>Spellcraft: 43 <br>Tumble:  41<br>UMD: 25<br><br>Total: 237 skill credits<br><br>AB: 25 base<br>    +10 Wis<br>    +1 WF<br>    +2 EWF<br>    ______<br>    38 w/ mundane sling<br><br>AC: 10 base<br>    -1 Dex<br>    +8 Full Plate<br>    +3 Tower Shield<br>    +8 Tumble<br>    ______<br>    28 AC naked and unbuffed<br><br>HP: 420 max unbuffed (in human form)<br><br><br>I realize that this build is similar to some of cdaulepp's builds, but this one seems a little more playable to me.  It doesn't get an Uber high AC because it doesn't have any Monk levels, but with your Cleric buffs you can still get a decent AC.  <br><br>I chose Rogue rather than Monk both because it gave more skill credits as well as more damage.  Even though this character doesn't have an Uber high AC, he does get a decent Fort save (31 in Human form, 40 in Dragon Form), and you can use buffs to boost this even more (+1 Prayer, +2 Battletide, +2 Aura of Vitality, +1-2 Endurance).  The total Fort save is 46-47, which isn't bad, although there will probably still be some people who will be able to Dev. Crit. you.    <br><br>Additionally, you get 40/- DR in Dragon Form, and you have huge health, so you can absorb a lot of damage.  If you find yourself getting your butt kicked, you can shift out of Dragon Form and cast Heal, which will get you to full health and only takes half a round to cast, assuming you still have Haste active.    <br><br>The Rogue levels are particularly useful in Human form, allowing you to do decent damage against enemies that are not vulnerable to sneak attacks, even with a Sling, which is generally considered to be a weak weapon.  Note that you don't need stealth to make use of sneak attacks; You get Improved Invis. at CLeric lvl 7, and before that you have Darkness/Ultravision.  You also have summons, including an animal companion that will help tank for you.      <br><br>Your buffs will boost your AB up quite a bit:<br><br>+5 Divine Favor<br>+5 Divine Power <br>+1 Bless<br>+1 Aid<br>+1 Prayer<br>+2 Battletide<br>+5 Greater Magic Weapon<br>+1-2 Owl's Wisdom<br>_________<br>59-60 AB with a mundane Sling<br><br>Of course, you may need magical ammo to be able to overcome the DR of certain creatures, but you have some decent damage spells, and the DCs are decent due to your high Wisdom.  Of course, you might have trouble beating SR at higher levels, but you do have the Druid spell Nature's Balance, which will lower your enemies' SR, although it does give them a save.
