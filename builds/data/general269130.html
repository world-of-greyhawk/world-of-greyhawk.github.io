I wouldn't base it on the speed or uncanny dodge, but on the skill dumps. Only 2 Rogue means you can only do 2 UMD skill dumps, and probably can't afford to take Rogue at level 1 (you wouldn't even get UMD to 5, and would only be able to bump it once). I would probably go for 4 Rogue and 1 monk - take Rogue at level 1 (to store up some skill points for later dumps), 17, 27, and 37. Take Monk at 21 (so you don't penalize AB too badly).<br><br>TM

First, you need to  have the skillpoints to dump. I presume you will be maxing Spellcraft, Concentration, Tumble, and UMD. Cleric only gets 2 + Int mod skillpoints, and even taking Rogue at level 1 and 3 more is only going to gain you another 42, so even as a human you will only be able to max out 4 skills with Int 10.<br><br>Second, as Kail pointed out, without pumping Str (which it sounds like you won't be doing), Discipline isn't that useful anyway. It will only help against natural 20's from lower AB opponents.<br><br>But if you really want it, go ahead and take 3 Rogue, 2 monk. Take Rogue at 1, 17, and 37. Take Monk at one early point for your Wis AC and at 40 for the discipline dump. <br><br>Are you planning to level this guy, or does he get to start at level 40? Note that if you are playing him from level 1, there will be long stretches without skill dumps. If you start at level 40, just go Rogue 1, cleric to 35, rogue 2-4, monk 1.<br><br>TM

thanks for the advice.<br>i really would not have ever thought of the discipline matter, looks like i wont need discipline then.<br><br>i will play this build from level 1, but leveling is not too harsh where i play, level 40 can be reached in about a week, and i will be playing in a party.<br>i just want the best character for level 40 and are ready to make sacrifices in playability while leveling.<br><br>note: i am a humang with 14 int, that's 6 skills to max out i think.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By dust7 on 03/23/07 11:56</span></i></p>

Well, then I would go with:<br><br>Rogue at level 1<br><br>Monk at level 7 (tumble dump)<br><br>Rogue at level 17, 27, and 37 (tumble and UMD dumps). <br><br>If you are concerned about XP penalties, then switch the 17 or 27 rogue level to a second monk level. If not, then Rogue will get you a few more skill points and the extra UMD dump. You will have a 20% XP penalty from level 27 up.<br><br>TM

Even a low AC monk will avoid being hit much, and a high AC monk (enough to make that -10 and -15 shot very difficult) will barely ever take a scratch. Can't remember what Entropic Shield is, but deflect arrows and II is already stopping archers.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Entropic Shield makes you evade 20% of ranged attacks, or so it says the description, though I've never used it, I suppose it's good against archers at any rate. I don't know if it stacks, it should, since Deflect Arrows works different than a concealment style of evasion (because that's how Entropic Shield works right? 20% affects in the same way concealment does?), you'll just have to test if it stacks.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/29/07 15:26</span></i></p>
