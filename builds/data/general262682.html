The <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_exaltedsorceress.html" target="_blank">Exalted Sorceress</a> is a golden oldie, and still one of the best casters around AFAIK. Mage vs Mage fights tend to require a bit of luck if both are equally good builds, but if you can get the drop on him you'll have a good chance of winning.

I would think that a Rak build would also be a Sneak Mage hunter.<br><br>If that mage is a Time Stop Spammer, then he probably doesn't memorize any other 9th level spells.  A Rak would outlast him.

My mage build makes 13 level 9 spells <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   but I seriously believe they won't make so many.<br><br>Mages usually also have low Fort saves, since he could have 10 PM levels against Dev Crit, simply try Necromancy (make sure to focus on Necromancy), the first to cast Wail of Banshee wins.<br><br>On another side he could use a Sorcerer 37 / Paladin 1 / Blacguard 2, so his saves would be high enough for any spell, make a mage with a considerably good HP and try to spam Time Stop with IGMS before him (after checking that his saves are high with a Necromancy spell of course), a nice HP can make the difference of resisting maybe only one more spell than him, and thus you might win. I know that such a build is not actually a "sneaker mage" but it's an option for other enemies, I generally prefer 2 Blackguard levels for Dark Blessing and amazing saves than 1 Monk for Evasion which doesn't work on all saves-related checks.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 01/09/07 02:42</span></i></p>

IGMS is excellent to pick off sneaking enemies too, since you can just target the gorund immediately where he disappears if you're first to Timestop and don't have an active true seeing. Or, of course Rakshasa as mentioned, with Perma true seeing and maximised/empowered Icestorms.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

If he's using HiPS he's probably a wizard (skill points help with shadowdancer prerequisites).  A Rakshasa, SR monk, or a mage of your own would do well.  An implosion cleric might do the job as well (it isn't death magic, and wizards do have low fortitude saves).  Stay away from spells with reflex saves for half damage, he probably has evasion and a decent reflex save. he'll probably has immunity mind spells (mind blank) and a high wisdom save.  He might also have immunity to death magic from shadow shield.  If you are going against him as a mage, try a timestop, flame arrow, flesh to stone combo. Good Luck!<br><br>Tangential comment: Wizards are way easier to kill in NWN2 with no timestop and the weaker bigby spells.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
