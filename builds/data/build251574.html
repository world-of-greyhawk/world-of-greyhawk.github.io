I like paladin builds and I like their buffing power. I always try to go for at least 19 lvl, although sometimes 17 can be enough; 15 is the bare minimum to me and I always try to get more. Anyhow, the next step after the full spell allotment is undispellability and I must confess I enjoy my undispellable Paladins. This said, I also enjoy mixing a versatile class like Rogue to melee builds and I simply love Crippling Strike. The result is this build, Fighter added in for WS/EWS and two bonus feats which free up general feat slots for save boosters.<br><br>The build has got an <b>XP penalty</b>, but it starts only at 32nd lvl and it's the minimum 20% penalty. I think it's worth it.<br><br>Considering I'm going for CS I decided to get Epic Reflexes to put to some good use evasion (with self buffed CHA the ref save is good and more so vs spells). One could drop Epic Reflexes and ESF: Discipline for 2 more Great STRs which might be a feasible variant especially if going for IE instead of CS.<br><br>Skill points are alloted to give you full Epic Traps skills plus the usual stuff; customization is open for specific needs. Less traps skills and more Taunt is definitely a possibility, as indicated.<br><br>The AB is decent and self buffable at 56-57 (depending on Bull's STR roll), AC is ok for a meleer, saves are ok but for will; CHA buffs and enhancements will definitely help in this department and you've always got PfA in your spellbook.<br><br>Overall a versatile melee build: this Paladin surely has got some aces up his sleeve.<br><br><br>******************************<br> <br><br><b>Defender of the Faith - Paladin(26), Rogue(10), Fighter(4)</b><br>Human, LG<br><i>PvM, playable 1-40</i><br><br><br><b>ABILITIES (ending)</b><br>STR: 15 (28)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 12<br><br><br><b>STATS SUMMARY</b><br>Hitpoints: 480<br>Skillpoints: 293<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 27/21/25<br>Saving Throw boni: Spells: +4, Traps: +1, Evasion<br>BAB: 29<br>AB: 42 (melee), 29 (ranged)<br>Buffed AB: 56 (minimum self buffed), 68 (capped AB + STR)<br>AC (naked/full plate and tower shield): 20/30 <i>(32 with +4 to DEX)</i><br>Sneak attacks: 5d6<br>Spell Casting: Paladin(4)<br>Spells per level: 4/4/3/3<br><br><br><b>SKILLS</b><br>Concentration 42(44)<br>Disable Trap 34(38)<br>Discipline 42(61)<br>Open Lock 16(15)<br>Search 1(3)<br>Set Trap 43(44)<br>Spellcraft 18(20)<br>Tumble 40(39)<br>UMD 39(40)<br>no points leftover<br><br><i><b>a nice variant is:</b></i><br><br>Disable Trap 12(16)<br>Set Trap 24(25)<br>Taunt 41(42)<br><br><br><b>LEVELING GUIDE</b><br>01: Rogue(1): Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes<br>02: Rogue(2): {Evasion}<br>03: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus, Knockdown<br>04: Fighter(2): STR+1, Blind Fight, (STR=16)<br>05: Paladin(1)<br>06: Paladin(2): Great Fortitude, {Smite Evil}<br>07: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>08: Paladin(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>09: Paladin(4): Improved Knockdown<br>10: Paladin(5)<br>11: Paladin(6)<br>12: Paladin(7): STR+1, Improved Critical, (STR=18)<br>13: Paladin(8)<br>14: Paladin(9)<br>15: Paladin(10): Extend Spell<br>16: Fighter(3): STR+1, (STR=19)<br>17: Rogue(4)<br>18: Paladin(11): Toughness<br>19: Paladin(12)<br>20: Paladin(13): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>21: Paladin(14): Epic Weapon Focus<br>22: Paladin(15)<br>23: Paladin(16)<br>24: Fighter(4): STR+1, Weapon Specialization, Epic Weapon Specialization, (STR=21)<br>25: Paladin(17)<br>26: Paladin(18)<br>27: Rogue(5): Great Strength I, (STR=22)<br>28: Paladin(19): STR+1, (STR=23)<br>29: Paladin(20)<br>30: Paladin(21): Great Strength II, (STR=24)<br>31: Paladin(22)<br>32: Rogue(6): STR+1, (STR=25) <i><b>XP penalty (20%) starts here</b></i><br>33: Rogue(7): Great Strength III, (STR=26)<br>34: Paladin(23): Armor Skin<br>35: Paladin(24)<br>36: Paladin(25): STR+1, Epic Skill Focus: Discipline, (STR=27)<br>37: Rogue(8)<br>38: Rogue(9)<br>39: Paladin(26): Epic Reflexes, Epic Prowess<br>40: Rogue(10): STR+1, Crippling Strike, (STR=28)<br><br><br>******************************<br><br><br>Feedback and constructive criticism are, as usual, gladly appreciated.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br><br><br><i>Edit: applied for membership at the "Clumsy Paladin Club", went for Extend Spell</i><br>_________________<br>Stand and fight, live by your heart<br>Always one more try, I'm not afraid to die<br>Stand and fight, say what you feel<br>Born with a Heart of Steel!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 08/31/06 23:21</span></i></p>

Nicely done.  Out of curiosity why DEX 10, CHA 10?  Wouldn't DEX 8, CHA 12 give you a +1 to foritude and will at the cost of 1 AC (and seeing as a +4 to DEX is generally about as easy to get as a +2, not much of loss anyway).  Also, no still spell?  Perhaps not so vital, but I'm a big fan of those extended divine favors.  Nothing really to add outside of that.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Good Pally build Kail.<br><br>I'd probably drop Luck of Heroes to make room for the metamagic feat. (You've got some Pally spells like Eagle's and Aura to boost your CHA to get good save boosts, so the loss of 1 on your saves isn't dire).<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I think we take extended, not so much for the extended div fav!   I think we take it to have 2 rows of div fav!  But thats just me!

Thanks all guys! You convinced me, now where's my padded helmet? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>My bad about Divine favor duration I always mix it up with Divine power duration for some reason. It's Extend Spell then. I dropped Luck of Heros; the CHA increase makes up for it. A minor DEX enhancing item and a potion of Cat's Grace will take care of DEX and the lost AC and ref save. Luckily we ain't got mounts in NWN1, or my paladin would have problems getting on the horse <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?

Indeed. Since there are no Divine Feats, it's hard not to justify some kind metamagick for the Paladin here.  Hell, is there any world where one could find an item that grants a bonus 5th level spell slot for an Extended Holy Avenger?<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Last tournament, we had to wait two hours for the first competitors to get on their horses.  After the sixth squire had a armored knight fall on him, the union demanded hazard pay and went on strike.  Finally we had to get a mage to shrink the horses, get the paladins to straddle them and finally enlarge them again.  Would you believe once we did finally get the knights on their horses and positioned for the joust, one of them fell off while waving to a maiden and we had to declare the other the winner.  <br><br>After that debacle, we just got rid of the horses and had the knights pick up their lances and run at each other.  It was going well, until one of them tripped burying his lance into the ground.  This turned the lance into spring, and vaulted the knight through the air and into the stands.  At this point, the peasants demanded hazard pay and went on strike.  There was no point to continuing at that point, so we all went back to the keep and got plastered.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
