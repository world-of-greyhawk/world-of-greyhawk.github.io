I am planning to play on deepingdale, so I won't be able to be a rakshasa or include the following:<br><br>Psionic<br>Scout<br>Spellsword<br>PnP shifter<br>Demilich<br>Samurai<br>Wilder<br>Dragon<br>Abberation<br><br>Beside that, is there a good longsword or bastard sword soulknife build? Seems like a cool class, if I could see how to make it even powerful it would be great. If that is impossible, could you suggest an equally cool build? I know this is a very vague request but don't know much about PRC.

I am not sure how much help we can be for you.  I am really one of the few that play PRC and, even that, i am limited on (prc is big).  It seems that your best bet is to check the forum for the server.<br><br>Once you do that, it is not a big deal to check the build search for a similar build using nwn classes.  The PRC doesnt have a search.  <br><br>Sorry i cant be of any more help than that, as i have no idea what you are refering too.<br><br>Good Luck
