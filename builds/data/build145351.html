Also, why would you ever combine those two classes when you will never be able to use your hide in plain sight? You Move Silently and Hide in Shadows skills will be so poor, that it practically makes HIPS useless.

Nah it can be done. The trick will be conserving skill points and just using whats neede to meet the prereqs. Once you take a SD level you can max them then with the saved points or at least get them to a respectable level. I'd say take a rogue level though in early teens instead of cross classing the SD prereqs. It'll cost you a caster level, but will net you a lot more skill points.

I made a wizard like this before, worked out very well.  The great thing about a wizard is the huge int, meaning you end up getting more skill points then even a pure rogue.  Dodge and mobility are also great feats for a pre epic wizard since the bonus to ac against AOO come in handy with spells.<br><br>If you take the first level of SD between 17-20 you can max tumble and hide/move silently.  This also means your 4th wiz bonus feat is saved for epic levels, giving you 14 feats to spend in epic levels, easily getting great int 10 and a few epic spells.  Between dodge, tumble, epic mage armor, dex buffed and uncanny dodge you will have impressive ac at high levels and have evasion for against casters and pvp.<br><br>HIPS has many advantages over invisibility.  First it's instant, you don't have to cast a spell and open yourself up to AOO and waste half a round.  You just click and you are safe.  Second HIPS can be done as many times a day as you like, so hide - cast spell, hide - cast spell can get you out of alot of trouble.  Lastly Invisibility can be seen through with many spells, even area of affect spells.  Hide can only be seen with true sight, which on many servers is changed to no longer allow the caster to see hiding characters.<br><br>Since he is a wizard he can cast invisibility when merely walking between places to allow him to travel at full movement speed, then utilize HIPS when it suites him best.<br>Just did this quick, haven't run it through a test build server yet.<br><br>Wizard 38/SD 2<br><br>Dwarf<br>str 10<br>dex 14<br>con 16<br>int 18<br>wis 8<br>chr 8<br><br>Wiz 19<br>SD 1<br>Wiz 19<br>SD 1<br><br>feats<br>1 Combat Casting<br>3 <br>5 Spell Penetration<br>6 Empower Spell<br>9 Maximize spell<br>10 Gr Spell Penetration<br>12 <br>15 dodge, Spell Focus Necromancy<br>18 mobility<br>21 Gr Int 1, Gr Int 2<br>24 Gr Int 3, Gr Int 4<br>27 Epic Mage Armor, Gr Int 5<br>30 Epic Spell Focus Necromancy, Imp Combat Casting<br>33 Epic Warding, Gr Int 6<br>36 Gr Int 7, Gr Int 8<br>39 Gr Int 9, Gr Int 10<br><br>Dwarf<br>str 10<br>dex 14<br>con 16<br>int 38<br>wis 8<br>chr 8<br><br>Skill points<br>Over 400 *I think* damn hard to figure out the skills a wiz with constantly shifting int gets<br>Conc - 42<br>Spellcraft - 42<br>Tumble - 40<br>Hide - 43<br>Move Silently - 43<br>Spot - 43<br>Listen - 43<br>Leaving over 100 skill points for whatever ya want.

I'm not really experience with magic builds yet, so I was wondering how much influence the extra int has on your spell casting...is it only more spell slots or does it make them a bit more powerfull too?

<i>The idea is to move away with HIPS and never let them get near enough to hit you.</i><br><br>With concealment bonus, you won't get hit that mention. And invsibility can archieve the same thing, especially if quick spell it. Like I said, HIPs is useless to Mages because they cast spells that to the same function.

And do not have to slowly walk away from my enemy to get pass them. And again, my invisibility spells last for hours so I doubt I'll need HIPS.

If silent spell worked while hidden, those 2 lvls of sd would  be even more useful.  I was suprised to find out it didnt work with hide, simply because the name is so suggestive.  Just to make sure, is silent spell only useful if you are silenced?

TyrPaladin:<br><br>You missed (and I forgot to mention) another point, when invisible by spell if you perform a hostile action you'll become (partly) visible again and you'd have to recast the spell to get invisible again. HIPS can be used infintely, so you won't have to rest that much for replenishing your spells. Also I'd like to use as much slots as possible for damage spells (preferably evocation), I only need one or two for emergencies to really get away and be able to rest. Also I believe most of the spell effects are dispellable, HIPS is not dispellable.<br><br>So HIPS is definitely not useless in this case.<br><br><br>gnived:<br><br>Yeah it would be very nice if silent spell could let you stay undetected while hidden, but then again...maybe it would be just too powerfull and take the fun out of the game (just imagine fireballs coming out of nowhere and nothing to fight against <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ). Perhaps a Silent en Still combined would be more reasonable (so you won't be detected by listen and/or spot).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Dimundome on 08/03/04 18:45</span></i></p>

I rebuilt slightly as a Wizard 36/Rogue 1/SD 3. I did a third shadowdancer level for making it more playable in low epic levels. Every level was wizard, except 9 which was a rogue, and 10, 25 and 39 which were SD levels. I ended up with max skills in concentration, lore, move silently, spellcraft, spot and tumble (well 40 in the last two) and a 21 discipline and 20 search. My version got you HIPs very early to use it your whole career. It can be easily modified to PRC to make a lot of use out of epic spells. It really only lost two caster levels. I did end with a lower int, because I personally hate starting with an 18 in a stat you aren't begining with a +2 in.<br>Message me if you want an email copy of the excel spreadsheet I did.

"You can attack while under the influence of GS as long as you don’t target an enemy, you can throw attacks out near their area to do damage." <br><br>Most of the spells I use in this build target an enemy. And as I said GS, invisibility, etc use spell slots, which I need for the damage spells. Also they can be cancelled by some other spells...<br><br><br>"HIPs on the other hands, you have to wait till the next turn to use it."<br><br>Hmm...don't know exactly how that works, but I don't intend to just stand around while waiting to become invisible. You can still run away and then use HIPS if that's the case, but I had no trouble hiding when I tested it.<br><br><br>"Wands are not limited, they are instantious like HIPS. Same with quicken spell and auto spell."<br><br>Wands are limited, usually once or twice a day, or they have charges wich are used up. In a battle with strong opponents you'll really need more then just one or two of those spells, especially when there are multiple opponents.

Cross classing the first points in the requirement skills isn't that much of a problem cause you get enough points, but if it's a problem to you, you could throw in a Rogue level and drop a wizard level + feat. Losing 1 epic spell and 1 wizard level won't be that bad, I'm gonna try it out myself when I get too it.<br><br><br>Don't get me wrong those spells are usefull, but only for a real escapes and not hiding, taking a bit of distance and recasting more damage spells.<br><br>Shortly summoned up:<br>- Spells take up slots, which can be used for damage spells<br>- Spells lose effect (partly) after targeting opponents directly<br>- Spells can be cancelled<br>- Spells are limited, even with wands.<br>- HIPS is free and available early, wands usually are not.

<i>Most of the spells I use in this build target an enemy. And as I said GS, invisibility, etc use spell slots, which I need for the damage spells.

Taking Monk and Rogue still means taking 2 non wizard levels, SD gives the same plus Uncanny Dodge and HIPS, you only use some skill points cross-class, but you have enough anyway.

Plus, later on, you get spells like Mesthil’s Sheath (Spelling?), which does 60 acid damage to whom ever hits you (95% of the creatures in this game are not immune to that elemental) and Epic Ward. If you get hurt, you’ll have Vampire’s Touch to steal HP.<br><br>In the end, you'll waste a lot time hide and casting when you can just select a few spells to blow your enemies away. Etherael Visage + Mesthil's Sheath + Vampire's Touch + IGM = Unstoppable.

Whether or not this is accurate to pnp I dont know, but I would like to say that hips you do not need to move away to go hidden. All you have to do is disengage , this can be done quite simply with hot keying your attack button. Pressing it again will disengage you without moving. <br><br>When I actually played this style ( I dont because I found the campaign a walkover to complete with it). I had a hot key on my nostromo keypad that actually was set up with 2 keys , one to disengage and one to go back into stealth. I was able to take out Grimgaw's group without taking any damage whatsoever, which Im sure you will agree is reasonably hard to do with just a solo melee character. I also did it first time. This should be easier with a caster since you dont even have to be in melee range to do it. <br><br>Syrath

Tyr, you obviously will never get it. Quit making stupid arguements saying he shoul donly rely on one tactic. I could make endless analogies to prove to you giving a character as many options as possible would be better than limiting the character. Of course as evo stated in another thread you are exceptional at making run of the mill builds. Under your arguemetn he should play a straight level 40 mage. He obviously doesn't want to do that. He already can do everythign a straight mag can. He just wants more options, and tweaked a straight mage for those options. They are actually good tweaks as well. As I stated above, I built the character with the modifications I posted. The character can kill a straight mage very easily. The straight mage has problems, because as soon as he is dispelled, HIPS kicks his backside around.

<i>As for abusing the system, I have yet to see the crafts abused more than marginally..</i><br><br>Let me tell you a true story about my many experience with Crafting System. In Malcolm’s Mayhem server, I had 1 million gps in the bank from forging rings of CHA for 8k a piece. In one sitting, I made over 300k. It takes a REAL long time to get good at that system in MM, but once you learn it, you a make a lot money off of it. Don’t stick your head in the sand and EXPECT players not to cheat. Half of them will. The other cheat that was being abuse in MM was twinkling.<br><br>MM players would make weapons or armor for their low level character so when they reach the level to use the item, the player won’t have to forge it.<br><br>Last, but not least, we had a forging system in another rpg and the players over charged us for enhancement weapons or armor. A player sold me a +2 sword for 4k when enhancements are 1000gp each. (3k for each enhancement.)

Not once they cast IGM. I played a sorcerer and killed people using Delayed Fireball traps or Darkness Traps. If know how to truly play a mage, you don’t fire your magic off.

The earliest he could have access to that would be 15th level.  Or, he could have his Shadowdancer level as early as 8th.

A real mage would have calculated what spell would be need and use those against those enemies.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>It may be true that he can't do each of that in one round.  I haven't put the reasearch into that.  Even so, your example puts casting an offensive spell in the 4th or 5th round, whereas my example would put it no later than 2nd, and that's if he wasn't already hidden.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<i>And no need to worry about enemies who dispell, which occur frequently in higher level games.</i><br><br>Dispell cannot disepell you unless you CROSS-CLASS too much.

Allright...from what I gather you're saying I should use the mage spells and tactics instead. So I can, I can use Ice Storm to disable those ogres you talked about in one spell. I can use GS, invisibility etc, when needed (I can memorize one or use scrolls for those emergencies). The only thing is I can hide anytime I want too, whithout having to cast a spell that uses slots, scrolls or wands. It saves me slots for more spells that do damage, so I won't run out of them that fast and I don't have to flee for resting. <br><br>I don't need those protection or hiding spells that often, therefore it's more usefull to have those on scrolls or wands (or memorize 1 incase no wands or scrolls are available) for the times you do need them.<br><br><br>As for the Rogue with UMD:<br>- my spells will be more powerfull <br>- I don't have to buy scrolls or wands everytime, they get used up and resting won't help, unless you got 1 use a day items, but then you'll need a lot of those to do the same.<br><br><br>My build is a stronger and better caster then the Rogue and can do pretty much the same as your wizard only this wizard uses a different strategy of taking out some enemies. Whether you like that strategy or not is not the point.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Dimundome on 08/05/04 09:43</span></i></p>

I actually went a slightly more roguish route that I emailed Dom. It was a 36 Wiz/1 Rogue/3 SD. That route gave uncanny dodge 1 and shadow daze. It is extremely powerful using PRC, capable of learning every epic spell available (with epic spellcraft gloves).<br><br>On a side note, Tyr, you still haven't answered how your version of this mage without any stealth would handle the dead magic zone in HotU. I know Dom's version is more than able in there. Your version dies to the first swarm of spiders and ettercaps, because it has no way yo bypass them and without any magic, you have nothing to kill them with effectively.

I don't even know what magic dead zone is to even comment, but I have been situation where I was cut off from my magic back in original NWN in the Path of Ascension module. The silence bug cuts you off without a save. I would suffer from silence when going into the tombs, but before going in, I would cast a balor spell and let the balor whoop up the undead, bodaks and death knights.

The main question I have is why 2 shadow dancer levels, if you are munchkinizing you might as well only take one level for hips at level 40 and then max your hide skills. Taking 2 levels doesn't get you anything worthwhile. Maybe take a level in some other class like monk and get some discipline as well as hide skills.

Not for uncanny dodge since the main point of the sd level is hips which comes at level 1. You are hiding not trying to tank. The evasion is worth it though.
