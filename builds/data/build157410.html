This is my way to try to emulate the PrC Mystic Theurge (available in the PRC) with Bioware classes. The result is pretty good.<br><br>Advantages<br>-Accesses 70 to 80% of the spells in the game. Extremely powerful when he gets time to prepare his spells before combat, especially if he knows what the enemy is.<br>-2-3 Epic Spell Focii<br>-3-4 Epic spells<br>-Can have auto-still spells<br>-Accesses the best arcane and divine buffs (undeath's eternal foe, shadow shield, death ward, freedom of movement, premonition etc ...)<br>-As easy as a common mage to level from level 1 to 20, easier than a common mage from 30 to 40.<br>-Excellent will save<br>-Very party friendly (your friends will love your buffs)<br>-Very flexible on feats and skills selection (the detailled build below is an example that can easily be customized)<br><br>Disadvantages<br>-Low AC (let's be clear about this : this is a pure spellcaster)<br>-Low HP (356 if dices maxed)<br>-Low fort and reflex save, although spellcraft gives a nice bonus against spells<br>-It's another mage, so the earliest levels are a pain<br>-Your spells DC are a little lower than a dedicated spellcaster<br>-Can experience problems with Spell Resistance (although Mordenkainen Disjunction can help)<br>-Can experience problems with dispelling, once it's fixed in 1.64 (Mordenkainen Disjunction can help here too)<br><br>Details<br><br>Race : Human preferably, any is doable (half-orc is not recommanded because of the intelligence decrease)<br><br>Alignment : Any ; I prefer lawful neutral, lawful good or neutral good, as i play it mainly on RP server and the cleric part is a worshipper of Mystra.<br><br>Base Attributes<br>STR 8<br>DEX 8<br>CON 16<br>WIS 16 (20)<br>INT 16 (22)<br>CHA 8<br><br>Leveling Guide<br>Levels 1-19 Wizard<br>Levels 20-40 Cleric, with wizard levels at 21, 27, 30, 33<br><br>Cleric domains<br>I recommand Healing (always useful) and magic (nice, and quite RP suited), but any will do.<br><br>Final Level Distribution<br>Wizard 23<br>Cleric 17<br><br>Attribute Bonuses<br>First 6 to intelligence<br>Last 4 to wisdom<br><br>Feats<br>Level 1: Spell focus Enchantement, Greater spell focus enchantement<br>Level 3: Spell focus Necromancy<br>Level 5: Greater spell focus Necromancy<br>Level 6: Spell Penetration<br>Level 9: Greater spell penetration<br>Level 10: Spell focus Illusion<br>Level 12: Greater spell focus Illusion<br>Level 15: Extend spell, Silent spell<br>Level 18: Combat casting<br>Level 21: Epic spell focus Enchantement, Epic spell focus Necromancy<br>Level 24: Epic spell focus Illusion<br>Level 27: 1 Epic spell of your choice<br>Level 30: 1 Epic spell of your choice<br>Level 33: 2 Epic spells of your choice<br>Level 36: Epic spell penetration<br>Level 39: Improved combat casting<br><br>Final Attributes<br>STR 8<br>DEX 8<br>CON 16<br>WIS 20<br>INT 22<br>CHA 8<br><br>Skill selection :<br>Concentration and Spellcraft are required (and useful)<br>I recommand Lore, Heal (high wisdom helps), Tumble, Disable Trap, Open Lock.

Looks very similar to my Red Mage, but with more HP and slightly better magic, although without Dev Crit (which is not balanced). I see this character in team, he would have a very hard time when alone... but he's as good in spamming IGMS (it's also not balanced) as any other character.<br>Also, if you take auto still spell for him, he would propably be too weak to move with full speed with armor and shield - although you can always cast Bull's Strength.

OK.. I'm not a builder by any means - and this is likely a dumb question.  But why not take most cleric levels pre-epic so that you have melee to fall back on in the early stages?  I may be wrong, but it seems the build would not suffer from it?  Even taking 12 cleric levels pre-epic would allow base attack 13; which is respectable enough for a mage to fall back on.
