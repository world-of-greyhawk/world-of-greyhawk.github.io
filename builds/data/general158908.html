The Rogue levels allow you to do some nice damage with your sneak attacks, and the Monk levels give you more attacks per round and help you to boost your AC (also gets you IKD and lets you max Discipline).  Cleric is mostly for the buffs, but the occasional Harm is nice as well.  A lvl 15 Cleric can buff himself up the +20 magical AB cap with nothing but a mundane weapon, and if you do start taking hits for 150+ HP, at least you'll be able to heal yourself.<br><br>I have a build like this posted; you can find it here:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "151185", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>I would actually change the levels a little.  Probably go Rogue 17/Monk 7/Cleric 16, alhtough the other build is viable as well.  You may want to consider Human rather than Halfling, for the simple reason that Halfings suffer a penalty to AB using IKD (which they really shouldn't; opponents also get a bonus to AB using IKD against them).  This build gets a good AC and a decent AB with all the Cleric buffs, and the damage is pretty nice too.

Looks quite good actually; thanks.  Just wondering; Monk7 gets 120% normal speed, is it worthwhile to get the extra monk levels for speed?  Also, does the AB from the other classes still work the same if using hand/kama(3ab? per attack instead of 5 for monk when using these types)?

It's debatable whether the extra 10% speed is worth it; personally, I would rather have higher sneak attacks and more spell slots, but it's up to you.
