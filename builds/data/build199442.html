Brutal Thug<br><br><b>Playable from level 1, PvM</b><br><br>A product of an Orc raider and a Human slave, the Brutal Thug was raised by Orcs. Outcast for his tainted bloodline, he survived only through his brute strength and ability to win fights. Sneaky enough to attack when opportunity presents his target in a vulnerable postion and strong enough to rush in and knock them down, the Brutal Thug takes pleasure in only one thing in life: pounding his opponent to a bloody pulp. Strong as an ox - and almost as intelligent - he relies completely on brute force. There is no subtlety involved with this loathsome character. He will ambush you if you present a vulnerability, knock you over if you're in his way, and laugh in your face as you struggle to get away.<br><br>Another build with no Dev Crit, but it could easily be taken by changing a few feats and I believe you'd only lose 2 points of STR.<br><br>Rogue 28/BG 4/Barb 8<br><br>1/2 Orc, Chaotic Evil<br><br>STR 20 <br>DEX 12<br>CON 16<br>INT 6<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 6<br><br>1 )Rogue1: Power Attack<br>2 )Rogue2<br>3 )Barb1: Cleave<br>4 )Barb2: STR (21)<br>5 )Barb3<br>6 )Barb4: Knockdown<br>7 )Rogue3<br>8 )Rogue4: STR (22)<br>9 )BG1: Blind Fight<br>10)BG2<br>11)BG3<br>12)BG4: Weapon Focus/ STR (23)<br>13)Rogue5<br>14)Rogue6<br>15)Rogue7: Toughness<br>16)Rogue8: STR (24)<br>17)Rogue9<br>18)Rogue10: Iron Will/ Imp Evasion<br>19)Rogue11<br>20)Rogue12: STR (25)<br><br>21)Rogue13: EWF/ Crippling Strike<br>22)Barb5<br>23)Rogue14<br>24)Rogue15: GRT STR I (26)/ STR (27)<br>25)Rogue16: Slippery Mind<br>26)Rogue17<br>27)Rogue18: GRT STR II (28)<br>28)Barb6: STR (29)<br>29)Rogue19: Epic Skill Focus: Discipline<br>30)Rogue20: GRT STR III (30)<br>31)Rogue21<br>32)Rogue22: STR (31)<br>33)Rogue23: GRT STR IV (32)<br>34)Rogue24: Epic Skill Focus:Taunt<br>35)Barb7<br>36)Rogue25: GRT STR V (33)/ STR (34)<br>37)Rogue26<br>38)Rogue27<br>39)Rogue28: GRT STR VI (35)/ Imp Sneak Attack I<br>40)Barb8: STR (36)<br><br>End Stats:<br><br>STR 36<br>DEX 12<br>CON 16<br>INT 6<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 6<br><br>Fort: 23<br>Refl: 19<br>Will: 16<br><br>Disc: 43<br>Tumble: 40<br>UMD: 42<br>Hide: 5<br>Set Trap: 33<br>Taunt: 43<br><br>AC in mundane plate: 27<br><br>Max non-Raged HPs: 464 (544 with Rage)<br><br>AB with mundane weapon of choice: +43/+38/+33/+28<br><br>He can also boost STR (and thus AB) with Rage 3x/day (as well as CON), as well as the BG Bull's STR spell for more STR/AB.<br><br>This character is an attempt to get big STR (without going the RDD route) with sneak attack and good HPs. Problems include low Will save (can be boosted slightly with the Rage ability), and low INT - so low skill points. However, it was built purposely to min/max for good CON and max STR. Just a kind of fun concept that I fleshed out into this monster.<br><br>Skills: You could drop Set Trap and take Spellcraft ranks instead (which is probably what most people would do with it), but I felt it didn't fit in with the build concept (I tried to steer clear of any INT-based skills), as he's got no brains at all and hasn't spent enough time around mages to learn what the spells are. Of course, this should mean no UMD either, but hey, I just can't let that skill go. I chalk it up to his thieving and stealing. He's found many a magical device on various corpses and in many of the places he's looted and has learned (painfully, I might add) how to use them. As for Taunt, I picture him poking his opponent in the chest, leering and drooling, grunting garbled Orcish insults, spitting in their face, and generally indicating his contempt of those weaker than himself.<br><br>As always, any suggestions/comments are welcome.<br><br><i>griphook ..Typo Corrected</i><br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 07/15/05 18:53</span></i></p>

Something to note in this build: I just found out (thanks Guitaragorn) that the BG Dark Blessing will actually take into account a negative modifier on CHA. This means you'll receive a penalty to your saves with low CHA, so the Brutal Thug's saves are actually lower by 2 on all three saves.<br><br>They should read:<br><br>Fort: 23<br>Refl: 19<br>Will: 16<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
