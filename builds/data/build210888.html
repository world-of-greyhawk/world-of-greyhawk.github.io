KD gives you a change to sneak, which is important for any rogue build as a way to generate sneaks, especially when you don't have spells or HiPS to help out.  In general I would say Take Advantage of KD!  but personal choices are always good.<br><br>since rogues are those who are skillfull, wouldn't it make sense, rp-wise, that he should try to study the arcane without studying under a teacher, so that UMD and spellcraft make sense?  but again, that is just my view.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger."

Kalisman77,<br><br>Another tough melee rogue! Nice job. Heh, on reading your build I was surprised to see no Knockdown/Imp. Knockdown and was already forming my response. But then I reached the bottom of the build and saw your comments on how best to build in Knockdown. I still think this build should definitely have KD and IKD...<br><br>Why don't you take Epic Wpn Focus at level 21 (Rogue 5) and then take Epic Wpn Spec at level 22 (Fighter 10)? Otherwise, if you're going to delay Epic Wpn Spec until level 37 I'd consider delaying Fighter 10 until level 40 and end as Rogue 23/Fighter 10/WM 7.<br><br>Nice job.<br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br>Have fun storming the castle!

Are you taking Fighter at 37 to also maximize Discipline? Apparently, so my advice to stop at Fighter 10 (taken at level 22) isn't so hot. In that case, I'd advise sticking with your Rogue 21/Ftr 12/WM 7 build, but do it like this:<br><br><br>1	Rogue 1	Dodge<br>2	Ftr 1	Wpn Finesse<br>3	Ftr 2	Wpn Focus, Mobility<br>4	Ftr 3	<br>5	Ftr 4	Wpn Spec<br>6	Ftr 5	Spring Attack<br>7	Rogue 2	<br>8	Ftr 6	Expertise<br>9	Ftr 7	Knockdown<br>10	Ftr 8	<b>Imp Knockdown</b><br>11	Ftr 9	<br>12	Rogue 3	Whirlwind Attack<br>13	WM 1	<br>14	WM 2	<br>15	WM 3	Blind Fight<br>16	WM 4	<br>17	Rogue 4	<br>18	WM 5	Imp.
