The topic references the build, not me personally.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br><br>OK,<br> <br>so for the same world I originally was asking for help on a Ranger a couple threads ago; I decided to go with a wizard instead.  Due to the <b>very</b> low level of magic; I am thinking a spellsword with enough umph to beat the enemy with either spells or blade.  I have come up with a general idea; and I would appreciate any help you can give me in tweaking him.<br><br>He is built more for RP than powerbuilt (reference no Stat below 10) but I see no reason I can't tweak for the most power possible within role play right? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br>Please bear in mind the Following:<br><br>-Very Low Magic World.  +2 weapons/Armor will probably be the norm; and then only at higher levels.<br><br>-Little to no immunity items.

The Level split from 1-4 is needed to meet world requirements.  You must advance two levels in a class before going beyond 2 in another.  I could do 1-2 wizard, 3-4 Fighter if it helps; but I gotta be 2/2 by level 4.<br><br>2.  I chose Necromancy for focus for RP reasons. I can change it if something would be better, but I felt that the Champion of the goddess of Magic would want to learn to dispatch his enemies in the quickest; kindest way possible rather than prolong the pain.  FoD/Wail are far faster and more "Humane" than say Weird etc <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     Also; a Mage who's focus is commanding forces in battle would have to be at least slightly intrigued by death...<br><br>3.  I chose to stop at 15 BaB pre-Epic in order to get the extra Wizard feat in for Craft Wand.  It would be quite useful on a battlefield; as well as handing out tokens to worthy aides and such.  I can go to BaB 16 and lose it if you feel it would be better getting the AB and extra attack than craft wand.<br><br>4.  The Non-com feats are there for RP purposes.  Being a commander of forces he would have to be able to persuade; intimidate or Bluff his friends or enemies.  They are not "must have" but I would prefer keeping at least one.<br><br>5.  He focuses on the Warblade for effect and presence on the battlefield, but he will be carrying a longsword and tower shield for those times they become necessary.  Just in case you were curious <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br>6.  CoT was for the saves primarily of course.  He can save against spells quite well alone; but I felt it would be pretty foolish for Mystra's General to collapse to a single blow from the opposing Army (Dev Crit) so I wanted his save as high as I can.<br><br>thanks for looking, and thanks in advance for any suggestions you have!<br>_________________<br>-4SakN<br><i>"never kiss a girl whose brothers have knife scars." <br>"never gamble without knowing a back way out."</i><br>-Robert Jordan<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By 4SakN on 08/01/07 19:46</span></i></p>

If you want the spell power of a Wizard (which is very effective in low-magic settings), then something along these lines is a good idea.<br><br>If you want to focus on melee, I would say that Cleric offers better buffs and protections, plus better BAB. Any of the many Cleric/fighter/X combos (where X could be Paladin, CoT, Monk, Rogue, etc.) would be very powerful in a low-magic world. <br><br>And if you are in a party situation, my Life of the Party build (Cleric 23/Bard 17) would be extremely useful in a low-magic setting. You could leave Wis at 20 and pump Str a bit to make her more effective in combat if you want. <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "233227", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>TM

OK, well after playing around with him a bit I decided to tweak the epic levels a bit.  this nets me Auto still spell and both epic spells faster; at the cost of a slightly later EWS.<br><br>I figure by level 24 I will be able to deal reasonably good damage with buffs anyway; so the EWS was more icing than a must.  The Auto still feats and epic spells are far more critical to epic survivability.<br><br>So; the new Epic life is as follows:<br><br>21: Illusionist(11): Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>22: Illusionist(12)<br>23: Illusionist(13)<br>24: Illusionist(14): INT+1, Improved Combat Casting, (INT=22)<br>25: Illusionist(15): Great Intelligence I, (INT=23)<br>26: Illusionist(16)<br>27: Illusionist(17): Automatic Still spell I<br>28: Champion of Torm(7): INT+1, (INT=24)<br>29: Illusionist(18)<br>30: Champion of Torm(8): Automatic Still spell II, Automatic Still spell III<br>31: Illusionist(19)<br>32: Illusionist(20): INT+1, Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy, (INT=25)<br>33: Champion of Torm(9): Epic Weapon Specialization: Greatsword<br>34: Illusionist(21)<br>35: Illusionist(22)<br>36: Illusionist(23): INT+1, Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor, Epic Spell: Epic Warding, (INT=26)<br>37: Illusionist(24)<br>38: Illusionist(25)<br>39: Champion of Torm(10): Great Intelligence II, Armor Skin, (INT=27)<br>40: Illusionist(26): INT+1, Epic Spell Penetration, (INT=28)<br><br><br>Still open to any suggestions if anyone sees anything that may help <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   Thanks again!<br><br><br><br>Oh, and P.S. :   I think I have decided on a different name as well; Either <b>Mystra's Champion</b> or possibly <b>Mystra's Blade</b>.

For starters; that was supposed to be Well; not Wee <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">   <br><br>This essentially is your build as I said; I was just looking to make sure I hadn't missed anything vital.  I took your build; made it human and adjusted the stats to be roleplayable.  Everything else is just feat preference.  I wanted the extra wizard feat pre-epic so I sacrificed an attack/round and 1 ab for it.  that was one of my questions up top; whether that was really advisable? (I need the craft wand feat; but maybe a better way to do it? I dunno)<br><br>I also wanted disarm/Imp disarm since I was using a large weapon already; so I took that in place of knockdown on yours.  I figure the bigby's line gives him a more powerful knockdown that the feat does anyway.<br><br>Your AB is only 2 higher than mine other than your strength (1 pre-epic and 1 Epic Prowess). But your build drops wisdom, dex and cha all to minimum.  I don't want an 8 wisdom; makes no sense on a "general" style PC; and the same for Cha.  I could drop the dex and add 2 to strength to raise my AB 1; as he can buff Dex anyway to gain the +2 AC it currently brings.  Would that be smart?  <br><br>My Motive is to make the build you created as a dwarf into an RP'able human instead <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By 4SakN on 08/03/07 17:13</span></i></p>

Yep it helped.  When I build something I usually get excited over the idea of it (which is why I built it to start with) and so I tend to overlook shortfalls.  I need others to slap me and say "Hello!  It sucks!"<br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    well, it's not really about overlooking shortfalls, a build can be strong without a perfect feat selection, just take a moment to check all your ending stats after building, I understand your point, when I make a build I also overlook its weaknesses and normally think it's so cool, but then it happens it isn't that cool... <br><br>Not everyone around is a heartless son of a... to say a build sucks, nobody actually says such hard comments because they are mean (even if they were to think them), there's this "hidden policy" of saying what you can to improve a build, but don't say it's crap even if it is, if you can't say something good then don't say anything I guess.<br><br>Heh, curious, I remember once a guy got angry when we criticized his build, it was strange really, but the guy felt offended somehow that we posted how to improve it, it wasn't a hard critic, the build didn't sucked or anything, we just posted a few changes on feat selection and starting abilities or the like, like we always do (I don't remember that much of specifics), normally people are thankful to get their builds improved, I am, but I couldn't believe the guy, he left the guild just for that.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.
