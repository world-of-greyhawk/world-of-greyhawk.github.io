Straight from the creator himself, from a thread a while back about an Undead Hunter build:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>The best Undead Killing MACHINE I have seen is the Divine Harper build by cdaulepp. <br><br>I have a link to it in my signature, but here it is again:<br><br>Race Human<br>Alignment Lawful Good<br><br>Starting Stats <br>Str 14<br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 10<br>Wis 14<br>Cha 16<br><br>1 Paladin Discipline 4, Taunt 4, Save 4 Alertness, Weapon Focus: Scimitar <br>2 Paladin Discipline 1, Taunt 1, Save 5 <br>3 Paladin Discipline 1, Taunt 1, Save 6 Power Attack <br>4 Paladin Discipline 1, Taunt 1, Save 7 Charisma<br>5 Paladin Discipline 1, Taunt 1, Save 8 <br>6 Paladin Discipline 1, Taunt 1, Save 9 Divine Might <br>7 Paladin Discipline 1, Taunt 1, Save 10 <br>8 Paladin Discipline 1, Taunt 1, Save 11 Charisma<br>9 Paladin Discipline 1, Taunt 1, Save 12 Divine Shield <br>10 Paladin Discipline 1, Taunt 1, Save 13 <br>11 Paladin Discipline 1, Lore 6, Persuade 8, Taunt 1 <br>12 Paladin Discipline 1, Taunt 1, Save 1 Improved Critical: Scimitar Charisma<br>13 Paladin Discipline 1, Taunt 1, Save 2 <br>14 Paladin Discipline 1, Taunt 1, Save 3 <br>15 Paladin Discipline 1, Taunt 1, Save 4 Extra Smiting <br>16 Paladin Discipline 1, Taunt 1, Save 5 Charisma<br>17 Paladin Discipline 1, Taunt 1, Save 6 <br>18 Paladin Discipline 1, Taunt 1, Save 7 Iron Will <br>19 Paladin Discipline 1, Search 4, Taunt 1 <br>20 Champion of Torm Discipline 1, Save 2 Charisma = 21<br>21 Champion of Torm Discipline 1, Save 4 Great Charisma I, Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar <br>22 Champion of Torm Discipline 1, Save 6 <br>23 Harper Scout Discipline 1, Tumble 10 Great Charisma II <br>24 Harper Scout Tumble 5 Great Charisma III Charisma = 25<br>25 Harper Scout Tumble 5 <br>26 Harper Scout Tumble 5 <br>27 Champion of Torm Discipline 3 Epic Prowess, Great Smite 1 <br>28 Champion of Torm Discipline 2, Save 1 Strength<br>29 Champion of Torm Discipline 1, Save 3 Great Smite 2 <br>30 Champion of Torm Discipline 1, Save 5 Great Smite 3 <br>31 Champion of Torm Discipline 1, Save 7 Great Smite 4 <br>32 Champion of Torm Discipline 1, Save 9 Strength<br>33 Champion of Torm Discipline 1, Save 11 Great Smite 5, Great Smite 6 <br>34 Paladin Discipline 1, Taunt 12, Save 1 <br>35 Champion of Torm Discipline 1, Save 3 <br>36 Champion of Torm Discipline 1, Save 5 Great Smite 7 Strength<br>37 Champion of Torm Discipline 1, Save 7 <br>38 Champion of Torm Discipline 1, Save 9 Great Smite 8 <br>39 Champion of Torm Discipline 1, Save 11 Great Smite 9 <br>40 Harper Scout Discipline 1, Tumble 15 Great Charisma IV (Charisma finishes at 26) Strength = 18<br><br>Saves Normal (buffed)<br>Fort 40 (62)<br>Ref 32 (56)<br>Will 35 (57)<br><br>Level Distribution <br>Paladin 20<br>Champion of Torm 15<br>Harper Scout 5<br><br>Final Skills <br>Discipline 43<br>Lore 6<br>Persuade 8<br>Search 4<br>Taunt 34<br>Tumble 40<br><br>Final Stats <br>Str 18<br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 10<br>Wis 14<br>Cha 26<br><br>Equipment <br>Scimitar <br>Full Plate <br>Tower Shield <br><br>AC (buffed) <br>28 (42) <br><br>Attack Schedule <br>59/54/49/44 <br><br>Damage (always applied) <br>1d6 (critical: 15-20 / x2) Scimitar<br>5 (physical) Minimum Strength Modifier = 5<br>5 (slashing) Greater Magic Weapon or Holy Sword<br>1 (slashing) Prayer<br>12 (divine) Divine Might<br>7 (divine) Divine Wrath<br>5 (magical) Divine Favor<br>3 (sonic) Deafening Clang<br>Total = 1d6 + 11 (physical) + 19 (divine) + 5 (magical) + 3 (sonic) <br><br>Damage (situational) <br>2d6 (divine vs. undead) Bless Weapon<br>1d6 (divine vs. evil) Holy Sword<br>350 (physical vs. evil) Smite Evil<br>5 (physical) Power Attack<br><br><br>In this case, all of the situational damage will get applied.

You get a nice kick to your attack bonus if you activate Divine Wrath, a huge bonus to AC from Divine Shield, and a huge bonus to damage from Divine Might.<br><br>cdaulepp<br><br>p.s. The alternative to a smiting build for you would be a 15 cleric/ 20 paladin/ 5 Harper Scout build. That would be just spectacular. Or you could do a 15 cleric/ 15 paladin/ 10 CoT and end up nicely too.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 10/15/05 00:06</span></i></p>
