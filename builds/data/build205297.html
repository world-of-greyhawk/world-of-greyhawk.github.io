I very much like the idea, but there are a few problems with the ending of the build:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/23/05 02:03:03 (GMT) -- Ithacan<br>22) WIZ 5 Gr.Int. (17)<br>23) WIZ 6 <br>24) WIZ 7 GrDex (DEX 23) (DEX 24)<br>25) WIZ 8 <br>26) WIZ 9 <br>27) WIZ 10 GrInt III (INT 18) GrDex II (DEX 25)</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>You miscalculated the number of Great Intelligence feats that you took.  You jumped from Great Int I at level 22 right to Great Int III at level 27.  As written, you've only actually taken 3 Great Ints, which only takes you to INT 19, not 20.  That's not a huge deal though.  The second problem is a bit more serious:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;39) WIZ 20 Armor Skin; Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>You need to have at least 21 levels of wizard before you can take any epic spells.  Thus, you can't take any epic spells with this build as written.<br><br>Here's what I would do.  You need that 13th level of monk at the end for maximizing discipline.  What you can do is drop one of your Shadowdancer levels instead, so your final levels would be Monk 13/Wizard 21/Shadowdancer 6.  That does mean you'd lose slippery mind, but as a wizard, you'll have plenty of spells to protect you against mind effects.  So, instead of taking a shadowdancer level at level 31, take another wizard level.  That way, you'll hit wizard level 21 at character level 39, and will be able to pick up Epic Mage Armor.  Unfortunately, you'll also have to drop armor skin, because you won't be able to use your wizard bonus feat for Epic Mage Armor, since that bonus feat is only on your 20th wizard level.  But, that does mean you can use that now free bonus feat to pick up another Great Intelligence to get your INT to 20.  Here's what the epic progression would look like:<br><br>21) SD 5 GrDexI (DEX 22); <br>22) WIZ 5 Gr.Int. (17)<br>23) WIZ 6 <br>24) WIZ 7 GrDex (DEX 23) (DEX 24)<br>25) WIZ 8 <br>26) WIZ 9 <br>27) WIZ 10 GrInt II (INT 18) GrDex II (DEX 25) <br>28) WIZ 11 (DEX 26) <br>29) WIZ 12<br>30) WIZ 13 Epic Dodge<br>31) WIZ 14<br>32) WIZ 15 GrInt III (INT 19) (DEX 27) <br>33) WIZ 16 GrDex IV (DEX 28) <br>34) WIZ 17 <br>35) WIZ 18 <br>36) WIZ 19 EWF: Unarmed Attack (DEX 29) <br>37) WIZ 20 GrInt IV (INT 20)<br>38) SD 6 <br>39) WIZ 21 Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor<br>40) Monk 13 (DEX 30)<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 07/23/05 02:49</span></i></p>

Thanks, Steve.  Your fix is perfect.  You actually get slippery mind as a monk anyway.<br><br>My PW has nerfed Shadowdancer, though -- you don't get HIPS until level 7.  So I will have to skin the cat another way.  But the rest of the world has your fix.

You'd lose 1 BAB, but you only technically need 13 BAB with a monk build to get the full 5 attacks per round, and you currently have 14 BAB.  Then you can have your final 12th monk level at level 40.  You'd only really lose Ki Strike +2, which is worthless anyway if you can get gloves of at least +2.<br><br>Steve
