<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>This is a fairly basic build I've played through a number of times (PvM, since I only play SP modules or multiplayer non-PvP campaigns as Neverwinter Connections).  I like it for a number of reasons:<br><br>1) It's an elven rogue.  That means keen senses, dual wielding light or medium weapons, and no size penalty for knockdown.  But, it still avoids XP penalties, which can be a pain, especially in the types of games I play.<br><br>2) It uses a higher crit bladed weapon (rapier) normally, but can switch to a blunt weapon (mace) when needed (undead, constructs) and still be able to hit as effectively (more effectively even).<br><br>3) Gets Hide in Plain Sight, Epic Dodge, and Self Concealment V<br><br>So, without further ado:<br><br>Elf, any alignment<br>STR 10<br>DEX 20 (32)<br>CON 12<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8<br><br>1: Rogue(1) - Dodge<br>2: Fighter(1) - Weapon Finesse<br>3: Fighter(2) - Two-Weapon Fighting, Ambidexterity<br>4: Rogue(2)<br>5: Rogue(3)<br>6: Fighter(3) - Knockdown<br>7: Fighter(4) - Weapon Focus (Rapier)<br>8: Rogue(4)<br>9: Rogue(5) - Improved Knockdown<br>10: Fighter(5)<br>11: Fighter(6) - Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>12: Rogue(6) - Weapon Specialization (Rapier)<br>13: Rogue(7)<br>14: Fighter(7)<br>15: Fighter(8) - Weapon Focus (mace), Weapon Specialization (mace)<br>16: Rogue(8)<br>17: Rogue(9)<br>18: Fighter(9) - Mobility<br>19: Fighter(10) - Improved Critical (rapier)<br>20: Rogue(10) - Improved Evasion<br>21: Shadowdancer(1) - Epic Weapon Focus (Rapier)<br>22: Rogue(11)<br>23: Fighter(11)<br>24: Fighter(12) - Epic Weapon Specialization (Rapier), Great Dex I<br>25: Rogue(12)<br>26: Rogue(13) - Defensive Roll<br>27: Fighter(13) - Great Dex II<br>28: Fighter (14) - Blind Fight<br>29: Rogue(14)<br>30: Rogue(15) - Epic Dodge<br>31: Fighter(15)<br>32: Fighter(16) - Epic Weapon Focus (mace)<br>33: Rogue(16) - Self Concealment I, II<br>34: Rogue(17)<br>35: Fighter(17)<br>36: Fighter(18) - Epic Weapon Specialization (mace), Self Concealment III<br>37: Rogue(18)<br>38: Fighter(19)<br>39: Rogue(19) - Self Concealment IV, V<br>40: Fighter(20) - Epic Prowess<br><br>Disable Trap - 25<br>Discipline - 43<br>Hide - 42<br>Move Silently - 42<br>Open Locks - 20<br>Search - 20<br>Spot - 35<br>Tumble - 40<br>UMD - 41<br><br>Naked AC: 10 + 8 (Tumble) + 11 (Dex) + 1 (Dodge) = 30<br>Max HP: 362<br><br>AB with 2 mundane rapiers: 38/33/28/23 for main hand, 38/33 for off-hand<br>AB with 2 mundane maces, or rapier/mace combo: 40/35/30/25 for main hand, 40/35 in offhand<br><br>Damage with mundane weapons: 1d6 + 6 + 10d6 sneak attack.  Critical range for mundane rapier is 15-20, and critical range for mundane mace is 20 (NOTE: I specifically didn't bother with Improved Critical (mace) since the vast majority of enemies I come across which I would switch to maces for, like undead or constructs and such, are immune to critical hits anyway)<br><br>Saving throws (this is by hand, so hopefully I didn't mess it up)<br>Fortitude - 21<br>Reflex - 31<br>Will - 15<br><br>Depending on how high the ACs get in the module/PW you are playing, you might want to switch to short swords instead of rapier.  If you aren't going to get any more out of a 15-20 crit range as you would from a 17-20 one, you may as well dual-wield short swords for a smaller dual-wielding penalty.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 05/15/05 14:05</span></i></p>
