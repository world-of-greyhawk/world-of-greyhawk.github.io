I play on a server with lvl capped at 25 (it is more or less a PvP RP server with local vault) I am looking for a good druidic archer.  Requirements are 10 lvls of druid, and if monk is used it needs at least 10 lvls or the game erases your lvls for being an illegal char (a feature to stop people from grabbing a class for only one skill)  then there would have to be 3 or more lvls of anything else (please dont use BG)  I would appreciate any advice or if you have the time to spare for me a complete build.

Well; if it were me I'd go druid10/wiz2/AA11.  Get in most of the AA levels as early as possible (think you need +6 base attack in the first place though so it's kinda moot).<br>You're still pretty gimpy with under 20 levels of AA (something you'll have to live with); as archery is a really tough thing to get with 10-level restrictions.<br><br>I'll refrain from the negative comments on 25 levels; but I will say this.  It's not easy to make a solid planned build - thats good for PvP to boot - with 25 levels under the restrictions you mention.  I would rather go lvl25 something-or-other pure (mage maybe) then deal with the weaknesses as they appear.

Is Wiz(2) allowed within these restrictions? Or does the 10 class rule apply to all base classes? If it really applies to all base classes, then there's not much you can gain with (5 levels of) a prestige class...<br><br>I don't know why you want a Druid archer build, but if that's your goal, why not go for a pure Druid with high Wisdom and Zen Archery?<br><br>You could go Druid(10)/Rogue(15) for the Sneak Attacks...<br>Or something like Druid (10)/Cleric (15) with cleric domains Strength (for Divine Power and Divine Strength) and either War (for Battle Master) or Travel (for Haste).<br>With a good Wisdom and high Charisma (possibly boosted further by available items like a Nymph Cloak), and the feats Zen Archery and Divine Might, you should be able to do a fair amount of (partly Divine) damage with your bow. Plus, you have a nice share or both Druid and Cleric spells available.<br>_________________<br>Don't take life too serious.

I remember hearing about some sort of druid/CoT that gets dragon shape at level 25 or 26, perhaps that route might be intresting.

the 10druid/2wizard/11AA isn't viable. He said 3 lvls of everything else. Other than monk.

Sorry I have been away and didnt see how much confusion I caused *innocent look*  Ya, basically 3 lvls of everything except 10 monk and 5 BG.  And is it possible to have dragon form by lvl 25?  that would be VERY nice...

Max wis you will get in 25 levels is around 28 I think (4 grt wis + 6 at every 4 levels; 18 starting).  You need a wis of 30 to get dragonshape PLUS an extra feat for the shape itself.. I can't think of how to get that amount of feats in 5 epic levels to be honest.  Might be possible if you can find a way to get about 7 feats in those five levels..

You'd need a bonus feat on every single level in those 5, and have to be able to take Great Wisdom as a bonus feat for most of them.  The most levels in a row you can get bonus feats for is 4, and even then you wouldn't be able to take Great Wisdom for most of them.<br><br>Steve

You could get dragon shape if Aasimar or another subrace with a +2 to WIS was implemented, but that's digressing.<br><br>I would try a Druid 17/Fighter 4/CoT 4, wisdom based Zen Archery character. Go Druid 16/Fighter 3/CoT 1 pre-epic (16 AB), then CoT to 23, Fighter at 24 and druid at 25, so that as epic feats you could grab, epic weapon focus (longbow), epic prowess, weapon spec. and epic weapon spec. (longbow) and great wisdom I. Take your first level as a druid (skill points), then your second level as a fighter (heavy armor proficiency and simple and martial weapon proficiencies).  You'll have a good ranged AB, level 9 Druid spells and fair bit of extra damage from the weapon specs.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
