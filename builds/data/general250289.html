In keeping with our recent thread on moving the Guild into NWN2 territory when the time comes, I thought I'd post the information I've found from the NWN boards. To wit: the Races, Base Classes, and Prestige Classes. Perhaps we can all get a head start on thinking up some cool builds. A note: the infor on classes and races is allcdaulepp's work. I'm just doing a copy/paste. (If any of you other mods don't think this belongs here, feel free to delete it).<br><br><b>RACES</b><br><br><b>DWARVES</b><br><br>Gold Dwarf<br><br>The gold dwarves maintained their great kingdom in the Great Rift and managed to survive terrible wars against evil humanoids. While they practiced some magic, they never acquired the hubris that caused the downfall of some human nations. Confident and secure in their remote home, the gold dwarves gained a reputation for haughtiness and pride. Sine the Thunder Blessing, many young gold dwarves have left the Great Rift and are exploring the rest of the region. The folk of other lands have learned that while some gold dwarves are aloof and suspicious for the most part they are forthright warriors and shrews traders.<br><br>Racial Traits:<br>• Ability Adjustments: +2 constitution, -2 Dexterity<br>• Darkvision: Dwarves can see in the dark up to 60 feet.<br>• Stonecunning: +2 bonus to Search checks when inside.<br>• Lore Affinity: +2 bonus to Lore checks.<br>• Weapon Familiarity: Dwarven waraxes are treated as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.<br>• Hardiness vs. Poisons: +2 racial bonus to saving throws against poison.<br>• Hardiness vs. Spells: +2 racial bonus to saving throws against spells and spell-like effects<br>• Battle Training vs. Giants: +4 dodge bonus to Armor Clss against monsters of the giant type (such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants).<br>• Battle Training vs. Aberrations: +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against aberrations.<br>• Favored Class: Fighter.<br><br><br>Gray Dwarf (Duergar)<br><br>After rising up against their mind flayer enslavers, the gray dwarves, or duergar, emerged as a new subrace of dwarf with limited mental powers. Duergar on the whole are evil, but some turn their backs on their fellows and seek a different sort of life. Male and female duergar are bald, and women do not grow beards. They are much thinner than other dwarves, with severe facial expressions, gray hair and gray skin.<br><br>Racial Traits:<br>• Ability Adjustments: +2 constitution, -4 charisma<br>• Darkvision: Duergar can see in the dark up to 120 feet.<br>• Weapon Familiarity: Dwarven waraxes are treated as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.<br>• Stonecunning: +2 bonus to Search checks when inside.<br>• Immunity to Poisons: Immunity to all poisons.<br>• Immunity to Phantasms: Immune to the spells phantasmal killer and weird.<br>• Immunity to Paralysis: Duergar cannot be paralyzed.<br>• Hardiness vs. Spells: +2 racial bonus to saving throws against spells and spell-like effects<br>• Battle Training vs. Giants: +4 dodge bonus to Armor Clss against monsters of the giant type (such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants).<br>• Battle Training vs. Orcs and Goblinoids: +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs (including half-orcs) and goblinoids (including goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears).<br>• Stealthy: +4 racial bonus to Move Silently checks.<br>• Keen Senses: +1 racial bonus to Listen and Spot checks.<br>• Spell Like Abilities:<br>1/day – Enlarge as a wizard twice the duergar’s level (minimum 3rd level)<br>1/ day – Invisibility as a wizard twice the duergar’s level (minimum 3rd level)<br>• Light Sensitivity: -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, saves, and checks in bright sunlight.<br>• Favored Class: Fighter…<br>• Level Adjustment: +2. Duergar are more powerful and gain levels more slowly than other races. It will take much more experience for a duergar to reach level 2 than it would for normal races, for example.<br><br><br>Shield Dwarf<br><br>The dwarven kingdoms of long ago became locked in eternals wars with goblin-kind and other dwellers in the Underdark. One by one, the dwarven empires of the north failed, leaving only scattered survivors in the mountains or unconquered sections of the Underdark. The clans that survived these battles are the shield dwarves, and they are the most common type of dwarf seen throughout the Realms.<br><br>Racial Traits:<br>• Ability Adjustments: +2 constitution, -2 charisma.<br>• Darkvision: Dwarves can see in the dark up to 60 feet.<br>• Stonecunning: +2 bonus to Search checks when inside.<br>• Lore Affinity: +2 bonus to Lore checks.<br>• Weapon Familiarity: Dwarven waraxes are treated as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.<br>• Hardiness vs. Poisons: +2 racial bonus to saving throws against poison.<br>• Hardiness vs. Spells: +2 racial bonus to saving throws against spells and spell-like effects<br>• Battle Training vs. Giants: +4 dodge bonus to Armor Clss against monsters of the giant type (such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants).<br>• Battle Training vs. Orcs and Goblinoids: +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs (including half-orcs) and goblinoids (including goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears).<br>• Favored Class: Fighter…<br><br><b>ELVES</b><br><br>Drow<br><br>Descended from the original dark-skinned elven subrace called the Illythiiri, the drow were cursed into their present appearance by the good elven deities for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes inshades of lilac, silver, pink, and blue. They also tend to be smaller and slimmer than most elves.<br><br>Racial Traits:<br>• Ability Adjustments: +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, +2 Charisma, -2 Constitution.<br>• Hardiness vs. Enchantments: Immunity to magical sleep effects, +2 racial bonus to saving throws against enchantment spells or effects.<br>• Weapon Proficiency: Elves receive the Martial Weapon Proficiency feats for the longsword, rapier, longbow (including composite longbow), and shortbow (including composite shortbow) as bonus feats.<br>• Keen Senses: +2 racial bonus to Listen, Search, and Spot checks. An elf who merely passes with 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitles to a Search check to notice it as if she were actively looking for it.<br>• Spell-Like Abilities:<br>1/day – Darkness as sorcerer of equal level.<br>1/day – See Invisibility as sorcerer of equal level.<br>• Spell Resistance: Spell resistance of 11 + character level.<br>• Strong Will: +2 racial bonus to Will saves against spells and spell-like abilities.<br>• Light Sensitivity: Drow suffer -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, saves, and checks in bright sunlight.<br>• Favored Class: Wizard…<br>• Level Adjustment: +2: Drow are more powerful and gain levels more slowly than other races. It will take more experience for a drow to reach level 2 than it would for normal races, for example.<br><br><br>Moon Elves<br><br>Moon elves are the most common sort of elves in Faerun. Also called silver elves they have fair skin (sometimes tinged with blue) and hair of silver-white, black, or blue. Their eyes are blue or green, with gold flecks. They are the elven subrace most tolerant of humankind, and most half-elves are descended from moon elves.<br><br>Racial Traits:<br>• Ability Adjustments: +2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution.<br>• Hardiness vs. Enchantments: Immunity to magical sleep effects, +2 racial bonus to saving throws against enchantment spells or effects.<br>• Low-Light Vision: An elf can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination.<br>• Weapon Proficiency: Elves receive the Martial Weapon Proficiency feats for the longsword, rapier, longbow (including composite longbow), and shortbow (including composite shortbow) as bonus feats.<br>• Keen Senses: +2 racial bonus to Listen, Search, and Spot checks. An elf who merely passes with 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitles to a Search check to notice it as if she were actively looking for it.<br>• Favored Class: Wizard…<br><br><br>Sun Elf<br><br>Sun elves are less common across Faerun than moon elves, because most live on Evermeet, where nonelves are not allowed. Also called gold elves, they have bronze skin, golden blond, copper, or black hair, and green or gold eyes. These are seen as the most civilized and haughty elves, preferring to remain separate from nonelven races.<br><br>Racial Traits:<br>• Ability Adjustments: +2 Intelligence, -2 Constitution.<br>• Hardiness vs. Enchantments: Immunity to magical sleep effects, +2 racial bonus to saving throws against enchantment spells or effects.<br>• Low-Light Vision: An elf can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination.<br>• Weapon Proficiency: Elves receive the Martial Weapon Proficiency feats for the longsword, rapier, longbow (including composite longbow), and shortbow (including composite shortbow) as bonus feats.<br>• Keen Senses: +2 racial bonus to Listen, Search, and Spot checks. An elf who merely passes with 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitles to a Search check to notice it as if she were actively looking for it.<br>• Favored Class: Wizard…<br><br><br>Wood Elf<br><br>Wood elves are reclusive, but less so than the almost feral wild elves. Also called copper elves, they have coppery skin tinged with green, and brown, green, or hazel eyes. Their hair is usually brown or black, with blond and coppery-red occasionally found.<br><br>Racial Traits:<br>• Ability Adjustments: +2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution, -2 Intelligence.<br>• Hardiness vs. Enchantments: Immunity to magical sleep effects, +2 racial bonus to saving throws against enchantment spells or effects.<br>• Low-Light Vision: An elf can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination.<br>• Weapon Proficiency: Elves receive the Martial Weapon Proficiency feats for the longsword, rapier, longbow (including composite longbow), and shortbow (including composite shortbow) as bonus feats.<br>• Keen Senses: +2 racial bonus to Listen, Search, and Spot checks. An elf who merely passes with 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitles to a Search check to notice it as if she were actively looking for it.<br>• Favored Class: Ranger…<br><br><b>GNOMES</b><br><br>Deep Gnome<br><br>Hidden in the depths of the Underdark live the svirfneblin, or deep gnomes. Reclusive, suspicious, and resentful of intrusion into their cavern homes, the deep gnomes share little of the humor or openness of their surface cousins. The deep gnomes may be the world’s stealthiest and most elusive folk. Centuries upon centuries of surviving the deadly perils of the Underdark have bred in this race an amazing gift for avoiding attention.<br><br>Racial Traits:<br>• Ability Adjustments: +2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, -2 Strength, -4 Charisma.<br>• Small: As a Small creature, a gnome gains a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks, but he uses smaller weapons than humans use, and his lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.<br>• Darkvision: Deep gnomes can see in the dark up to 120 feet.<br>• Illusion Affinity: Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against illusion spells cast by gnomes. This adjustment stacks with those from similar effects, such as the Spell Focus feat.<br>• Battle Training vs. Goblinoids: +1 racial bonus to attack rolls against goblinoids (including goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears).<br>• Battle Training vs. Reptilians: +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds.<br>• Slippery Defense: +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against all opponents.<br>• Durability: +2 racial bonus to all saving throws.<br>• Keen Hearing: +2 racial bonus to Listen checks.<br>• Keen Smell: +2 racial bonus to Craft Alchemy checks.<br>• Spell-Like Abilities:<br>1/day – Blindness as sorcerer of equal level.<br>1/day – Entropic Shield as sorcerer of equal level.<br>1/day – Invisibility as sorcerer of equal level.<br>• Spell Resistance: Spell resistance of 11 + character level.<br>• Favored Class: Wizard…<br>• Level Adjustment: +3: Deep gnomes are more powerful and gain levels more slowly than other races. It will take much more experience for a deep gnome to reach level 2 than it would for normal races for example.<br><br><br>Rock Gnome<br><br>Rock gnomes are the most common type of gnomes in the region, and are usually just called gnomes since they are the only sort that surface dwellers ever see. Equipped by nature with keen curiousity and a knack for mechanical workings, gnomes excel at intricate crafts such as gemcutting, toy making, and clockwork engineering.<br><br>Racial Traits:<br>• Ability Adjustments: +2 Constitution, -2 Strength.<br>• Small: As a Small creature, a gnome gains a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks, but he uses smaller weapons than humans use, and his lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.<br>• Low-Light Vision: A gnome can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination.<br>• Hardiness vs. Illusions: +2 racial bonus to saving throws against illusions.<br>• Illusion Affinity: Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against illusion spells cast by gnomes. This adjustment stacks with those from similar effects, such as the Spell Focus feat.<br>• Battle Training vs. Goblinoids: +1 racial bonus to attack rolls against goblinoids (including goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears).<br>• Battle Training vs. Reptilians: +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds.<br>• Battle Training vs. Giants: +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type (such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants).<br>• Keen Hearing: +2 racial bonus to Listen checks.<br>• Keen Smell: +2 racial bonus to Craft Alchemy checks.<br>• Favored Class: Bard…<br><br><b>HALF-ELVES</b><br><br>Half-Elf<br><br>Humans and elves sometimes wed, the elf attracted to the human’s energy and the human to the elf’s grace. These marriages end quickly as elves count years because a human’s life is so brief, but they leave an enduring legacy- half-elf children. The life of a half-elf can be hard. If raised by elves, the half-elf seems to grow with astounding speed, reaching maturity within two decades. If, on the other hand, she is raised by humans, the half-elf finds herself different from her peers, more aloof, more sensitive, less ambitious, and slower to mature.<br><br>Racial Traits:<br>• Hardiness vs. Enchantments: Immunity to magical sleep effects. +2 racial bonus to saving throws against enchantment spells or effects.<br>• Low-Light Vision: A half-elf can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination.<br>• Keen Senses: +1 racial bonus to Listen, Search, and Spot checks.<br>• Amiable: +2 racial bonus to Diplomacy and Bluff checks.<br>• Favored Class: Any…<br><br><b>HALF-ORCS</b><br><br>Half-Orc<br><br>In the wild frontiers, tribes of human and orc barbarians live in uneasy balance, fighting in times of war and trading in times of peace. Half-orcs who are born in the frontier may live with either human or orc parents, but they are nevertheless exposed to both cultures. Some, for whatever reason, leave their homeland and travel to civilized lands, bringing with them the tenacity, courage, and combat prowess that they developed in the wilds.<br><br>Racial Traits:<br>• Ability Adjustments: +2 Strength, -2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma<br>• Darkvision: Half-orcs can see in the dark up to 60 feet.<br>• Favored Class: Barbarian…<br><br><b>HALFLINGS</b><br><br>Lightfood Halfling<br><br>The most common type of Halflings seen in the world, the lightfoots are the most likely to give in to their desire to wander. They are at home living side by side with folk of many different races and cultures.<br><br>Racial Traits:<br>• Ability Adjustments: +2 Dexterity, -2 Strength<br>• Small: As a Small creature, a gnome gains a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks, but he uses smaller weapons than humans use, and his lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.<br>• Stealthy: +2 racial bonus to Move Silently checks.<br>• Fearless: +2 morale bonus to saving throws against fear.<br>• Good Aim: +1 racial bonus to attack rolls with thrown weapons and slings.<br>• Keen Hearing: +2 racial bonus to Listen checks.<br>• Lucky: +1 racial bonus to all saving throws.<br>• Favored Class: Rogue…<br><br><br>Strongheart Halfling<br><br>While the lightfoot Halflings value the experience of travel and the sight of new lands and peoples, the stronghearts are a more organized, orderly, and industrious race. They build to last, and fiercely defend their homelands against threats that their lightfoot kin would simply flee. Strongheart Halflings enjoy athletic contests and value exceptional skills of all kinds.<br><br>Racial Traits:<br>• Ability Adjustments: +2 Dexterity, -2 Strength<br>• Small: As a Small creature, a gnome gains a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks, but he uses smaller weapons than humans use, and his lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.<br>• Stealthy: +2 racial bonus to Move Silently checks.<br>• Fearless: +2 morale bonus to saving throws against fear.<br>• Good Aim: +1 racial bonus to attack rolls with thrown weapons and slings.<br>• Keen Hearing: +2 racial bonus to Listen checks.<br>• Quick to Master: One extra feat at 1st level.<br>• Favored Class: Rogue…<br><br><b>HUMANS</b><br><br>Human<br><br>Humans are the most adaptable of the common races. Short generations and a penchant for migration and conquest mean they are very physically diverse as well. Skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, hair from black to blond, and facial hair (for men) from sparse to thick. Humans are often unorthodox in their dress, sporting unusual hairstyles, fanciful clothes, tattoos, and the like.<br><br>Racial Traits:<br>• Quick to Master: One extra feat at 1st level.<br>• Skilled: 4 extra skill points at 1st level, plus 1 additional skill point at each following level.<br>• Favored Class: Any…<br><br><b>PLANE-TOUCHED</b><br><br>Aasimar<br><br>Carrying the blood of a celestial, an aasimar typically fights against evil in the world. Some have a minor physical trait suggesting their heritage such as silver ahir, golden eyes, or an unnaturally intense stare.

Not all tieflings are evil or untrustworthy, but enough are that the prejudice tends to cling. Some tieflings have a minor physical trait suggesting their heritage, such as pointed teeth, red eyes, small horns, the odor of brimstone, cloven feet, or just an unnatural aura of wrongness.

<b>BASE CLASSES</b><br><br><b>Barbarian</b><br><br>The barbarian is an excellent warrior. Where the fighter’s skill comes from training and discipline, however, the barbarian draws upon a powerful primal rage. While in this berserk fury, he becomes stronger and tougher, better able to defeat his foes and withstand their attacks. These rages leave him winded, and he has the energy for only a few such spectacular displays per day, but those few rages are usually sufficient. He is at home in the wild, and he runs at great speed.<br><br>Class Features:<br>• Alignment Restrictions: Any nonlawful – barbarians are wild at heart.<br>• Hit Die: d12<br>• Base Attack Bonus: High.<br>• High Saves: Fortitude.<br>• Weapon Proficiencies: Simple and martial weapons.<br>• Armor Proficiencies: Light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).<br>• Skill Points: (4 + Int modifier x 4 at first level) 4 + Int modifier.<br>• Class Skills: Craft Armor, Craft Trap, Craft Weapon, Discipline, Intimidate, Listen, Parry, Survival, and Taunt.<br>• Rage: A barbarian can fly into a screaming blood frenzy a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian gains phenomenal strength and durability but becomes reckless and less able to defend himself. He temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. Rage lasts for 3 + Constitution bonus (including bonus from rage) rounds. After rage expires, the barbarian is tired and suffers -2 Strength, -2 Dexterity, and a -10% movement penalty for 5 rounds.<br>• Fast Movement: A barbarian has a 10% bonus to his movement rate.<br>• Uncanny Dodge: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.<br>• Trap Sense: Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian has an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, giving him a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses raise by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level).<br>• Damage Reduction: At 7th level, a barbarian gains the ability to shrug off some amount of injury from each blow or attack. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point.<br>• Greater Rage: At 11th level, a barbarian’s bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at -2.<br>• Indomitable Will: While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist mind-affecting spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his rage.<br>• Tireless Rage: When a barbarian reaches 17th level, he no longer gets fatigued from using rage and can ignore the penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and movment.<br>• Mighty Rage: At 20th level, a barbarian’s bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +8, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +4. The penalty to AC remains at -2.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Bard</b><br><br>A bard brings forth magic from his soul, not from a book. He can cast only a small number of spells, but he can do so without selecting or preparing them in advance. His magic emphasizes charms and illusions over the more dramatic evocation spells that wizards and sorcerers often use. In addition to spells, a bard works magic with his music and poetry. He can encourage allies, hold his audiences rapt, and counter magical effects that rely on speech or sound. Bards have some of the skills that rogues have, although bards are not as focused on skill mastery as rogues are. A bard listens to stories as well as telling them, of course, so he has a vast knowledge of local events and noteworthy items.<br><br>Class Features:<br>• Alignment Restrictions: Any nonlawful – bards are wanderers, guided by whim and intuition.<br>• Hit Die: d6<br>• Base Attack Bonus: Medium<br>• High Saves: Reflex and Will<br>• Weapon Proficiencies: Simple weapons plus longsword, rapier, short sword, and shortbow.<br>• Armor Proficiencies: Light armor and shields (except tower shields).<br>• Skill Points: (6 + Int modifier x 4 at first level) 6 + Int Modifier.<br>• Class Skills: Appraise, Bluff, Concentration, Craft Alchemy, Craft Armor, Craft Trap, Craft Weapon, Diplomacy, Discipline, Hide, Listen, Lore, Move Silently, Parry, Perform, Sleight of Hand, Spellcraft, Taunt, Tumble, and Use Magic Device.<br>• Spells: A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 10 for 0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). Bards do not suffer from arcane spell failure when wearing light armor: medium and heavy armors still incur the normal failure chance.<br>• Bardic Knowledge: A bard picks up a lot of stray knowledge while wandering the land and learning stories from other bards. Whenever a bard makes a Lore check, he adds his bard level to the result.<br>• Inspiration: The very presence of a bard is a constant inspiration to his companions. Unlike bardic music, bardic inspirations are always active and do not have a limited number of uses, however, the bard may only use one inspiration at any given time. At 1st level, the bard can only inspire courage, but as he increases in level, he gains access to a variety of inspirations from which his companions (and himself) may benefit. There are seven types of inspirations.<br>• Inspire Courage (1st level): This gives a bonus to hit and damage. It starts at +1, and becomes +2 at 8th level, +3 at 14th level, and +4 at 20th level.<br>• Inspire Competence (2nd level): This gives a skill bonus to all allies. It starts at +2 and becomes +4 at 11th level and +6 at 19th level.<br>• Inspire Defense (5th level): This gives a dodge AC bonus to all allies. It starts at +2 and becomes +3 at 10th level, +4 at 15th level, and +5 at 20th level.<br>• Inspire Regeneration (7th level): This heals all party members a certain number of hit points every round. This starts at 2 hit points per round, becomes 4 at 12th level, and 6 at 17th level.<br>• Inspire Toughness (8th level): This gives a bonus to saving throws for all allies. It starts at +1, then +2 at 13th level, and then +3 at 18th level.<br>• Inspire Slowing (11th level): All enemies that come within 20 feet of the bard have to make a Will save (DC 13 + = Bard level + CHA modifier) otherwise they will be slowed down. Initially they are slowed down 15% but at 16th level they are slowed by 30%. There are no further penalties besides movement, unlike the slow spell.<br>• Inspire Jarring (14th level): All enemies within 20’ of the bard suffer a -4 penalty to all Discipline and Concentration checks and -2 to all Will saves.<br>• Bardic Music: Once per day per bard level a bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him (usually including himself, if desired). The bard’s ranks in the Perform skill, and in some cases his bard level, determine what bard songs he can use. Bardic music has a duration of 10 rounds, unless an individual song specifies otherwise.<br>• Countersong (Req: Perform 3): This song puts a buff on the targeted ally that lasts for 10 rounds or until discharged. Any hostile magic spell that would affect the countersong’s target has to make a Spell Resistance check of 10 + levels of bard the singer possesses. Whether the spell is blocked or not, the counter-song is discharged.<br>• Fascinate (Req: Perform 3): Every hostile creature within 90 feet must make a Will save (against a DC of 11 + ½ the bard’s level + the bard’s Charisma modifier). This is an enchantment (compulsion) mind-affecting ability. If the target fails this save, then they are dazed for as long as the song is playing and the bard is within 90 feet of them. If a creature is attacked, or is within 10 feet of a creature being attacked, the effect ends for that creature, though anyone who fails their saving throw will be dazed for at least one round. There is a cool down of 10 rounds before this ability can be used again. Fascinate effects up to one enemy per level of the bard.<br>• Haven Song (Req: 3rd level, Perform 6): This song renders all enemies who fail a Will save (DC 11 + ½ the bard’s level + the bard’s Charisma modifier) to be unable to attack the bard, unless the bard takes hostile action against them or their allies (for example, attacking or casting a harmful spell). The Fascinate and Cloud Mind songs do not count as hostile actions.<br>• Cloud Mind (Req: 6th level, Perform 9): This is a more potent, single-target version of the Fascinate bard song. The saving throw DC is increased to 14 + ½ the bard’s level + the bard’s Charisma modifier, and enemies being attacked nearby don’t break the effect. There is a 5-round cool down before this ability can be used again.<br>• Ironskin Chant (Req: 9th level, Perform 12): This song provides damage reduction 5/- to the party for 4 rounds.<br>• Song of Freedom (Req: 12th level, Perform 15): At 12th level a bard gains this ability which allows them to do the equivalent of a break enchantment spell, with the caster level being equal to the bard’s spell level.<br>• Inspire Heroics (Req: 15th level, Perform 18): This song inspires either the bard or a single targeted ally. For 5 rounds, the inspired creature gains a +4 dodge bonus to AC and +4 morale bonus to saving throws. Additionally the inspired creature gains +4 temporary hit points per level. There is a cool down of 20 rounds before this ability can be used again.<br>• Inspire Legion (Req: 18th level, Perform 21): This song inspires all allies within 60 feet. The game determines the highest base attack bonus of all allies in the area of effect, and all affected characters now use this as their new base attack. All affected characters get a +4 competence bonus to damage rolls as well. This ability lasts for 10 rounds. There is a cool down of 5 minutes (game time) before this ability can be used again.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Cleric</b><br><br>Clerics are masters of divine magic, which is especially good at healing. Even an inexperienced cleric can bring people back from the brink of death, and an experienced cleric can bring back people who have crossed over that brink. As channelers of divine energy, clerics can affect undead creatures. A cleric can turn away or even destroy undead. Clerics have some combat training. They can use simple weapons, and they are trained in the use of armor, since armor does not interfere with divine spells the way it does with arcane spells.<br><br>Class Features:<br>• Hit Die: d8<br>• Base Attack Bonus: Medium.<br>• High Saves: Fortitude and Will.<br>• Weapon Proficiencies: Simple weapons.<br>• Armor Proficiencies: Light, medium, and heavy armor and shields (except tower shields).<br>• Skill Points: (2 + Int Modifier x 4 at first level) 2 + Int modifier<br>• Class Skills: Concentration, Craft Alchemy, Craft Armor, Craft Weapon, Diplomacy, Heal, Lore, Parry, and Spellcraft.<br>• Spells: A cleric casts divine spells, which are drawn from the cleric spell list. A cleric must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 10 for 0-level spells, Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth).<br>• Spells: Clerics specialize in two areas of magical expertise called domains. These domains are selected when first becoming a cleric and cannot be changed. Domains grant added spells and sometimes a free feat or special ability.<br>• Spontaneous Casting: A cleric can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the cleric did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can “lose” any prepared spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower.<br>• Turn Undead: Any cleric has the power to affect undead creatures (such as skeletons, zombies, ghosts, and vampires) by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol. A cleric can turn or destroy undead creatures<br><br><br><br><b>Druid</b><br><br>Druids cast divine spells much the same way clerics do, though most get their spells from the power of nature rather than from deities. Their spells are oriented toward nature and animals. In additional to spells, druids gain an increasing array of magical powers, including the ability to take the shape of animals, as they advance in level.<br><br>Class Features:<br>• Alignment Restrictions: Any neutral – druids, in keeping with nature’s ultimate indifference, must maintain at least some measure of dispassion.<br>• Hit Die: d8<br>• Base Attack Bonus: Medium.<br>• High Saves: Fortitude and Will.<br>• Weapon Proficiencies: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape.<br>• Armor Proficiencies: Light and medium as well as shield (except for tower shields).<br>• Skill Points: (4 + Int Modifier x 4 at first level) 4 + Int modifier<br>• Class Skills: Concentration, Craft Alchemy, Diplomacy, Heal, Listen, Lore, Parry, Spellcraft, Spot, and Survival.<br>• Spells:A druid casts divine spells, which are drawn from the druid spell list. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 10 for 0-level spells, Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth).<br>• Spontaneous Casting: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn’t prepared ahead of time. She can “lose” a prepared spell in order to cast any summon monster spell of the same level or lower.<br>• Animal Companion: A druid begins the game with an animal companion.<br>• Nature Sense: A druid gains a +2 bonus to Survival and a +2 bonus to Search and Spot while in wilderness areas.<br>• Woodland Stride: Starting at 2nd level, a druid gains a +10% movement increase when in outdoor, natural environments.<br>• Resist Nature’s Lure: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against all Fear spells and effects.<br>• Wild Shape: At 5th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into an animal and back again once per day. A druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. At 16th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into an elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) once per day. These elemental forms are in addition to the normal effects of wild shape, the druid gains all the elemental’s extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities. At 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice per day, and at 20th level, she can do so three times per day.<br>• Venom Immunity: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Fighter</b><br><br>Of all the classes, the fighter has the best all around fighting capabilities (hence the name). Fighters are familiar with all the standard weapons and armors. In addition to general fighting prowess, each fighter develops particular specialties of his own. A given fighter may be especially capable with certain weapons; another might be trained to execute specific fancy maneuvers. As fighters gain experience, they get more opportunities to develop their fighting skills. Thanks to their focus on combat maneuvers, they can master the most difficult ones relatively quickly.<br><br>Class Features:<br>• Hit Die: d10<br>• Base Attack Bonus: High.<br>• High Saves: Fortitude.<br>• Weapon Proficiencies: Simple and martial weapons.<br>• Armor Proficiencies: All armor (light, medium, and heavy) and all shields (including tower shields).<br>• Skill Points: ( 2 + Int Modifier x 4 at first level) 2 + Int modifier<br>• Class Skills: Craft Alchemy, Craft Weapon, Discipline, Intimidate, Parry, and Taunt.<br>• Bonus Feats: At 1st level, a fighter gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in addition to the feat that any 1st-level character gets and the bonus feat granted to a human character. The fighter gains an additional bonus feat at 2nd level and every two fighter level thereafter (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and 20th). These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as fighter bonus feats. A fighter must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Monk</b><br><br>The key feature of the monk is her ability to fight unarmed and unarmored. Thanks to her rigorous training, she can strike as hard as if she were armed, and strike faster than a warrior with a sword. Though a monk casts no spells, she has a magic of her own. She channels a subtle energy called ki, which allows her to perform amazing feats. The monk’s best-known feat is her ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow. A monk also has a preternatural awareness that allows her to dodge an attack, even if she is not consciously aware of it. As a monk gains experience and power, her mundane and ki oriented abilities grow, giving her more and more power over herself and, sometimes, over others.<br><br>Class Features:<br>• Alignment Restrictions: Any lawful – a monk’s training requires strict discipline.<br>• Hit Die: d8<br>• Base Attack Bonus: Medium.<br>• High Saves: All.<br>• Weapon Proficiencies: Monks are proficient with certain basic peasant weapons and some special weapons that are part of monk training. The weapons with which a monk is proficient are club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, quarterstaff, shuriken, and sling.<br>• Armor Proficiencies: Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields – in fact, many of the monk’s special powers require unfettered movement. When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.<br>• Skill Points: (4 + Int Modifier x 4 at first level) 4 + Int modifier<br>• Class Skills: Concentration, Craft Alchemy, Craft Trap, Diplomacy, Discipline, Hide, Listen, Lore, Move Silently, Parry, Spot, and Tumble.<br>• AC Bonus: A monk has a sixth sense that lets her avoid even unanticipated attacks. When unarmored, the monk adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five monk levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15h, and +4 at 20th level). She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, or when she carries a shield.<br>• Flurry of Blows: When unarmored, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, she may make one extra attack in a around at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty as does each other attack made that round. When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears. When using a flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes or with special monk weapons (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham).<br>• Unarmed Strike: At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.<br>• Evasion: A monk of 2nd level or higher can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or a fireball), she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor.<br>• Fast movement: At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to her speed. A monk in armor (even light armor) loses this extra speed.<br>• Still Mind: A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the school of enchantment.<br>• Ki Strike: At 10th level, a monk’s unarmed attacks are empowered with ki. Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. Ki strike improves with the character’s monk level, becoming lawful for purposes of damage reduction at level 10 and adamantine for purposes of damage reduction at level 16.<br>• Purity of Body: At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases.<br>• Wholeness of Body: At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal her own wounds. She can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to twice her current monk level each day.<br>• Improved Evasion: At 9th level, a monk’s evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks such as a dragon’s breath weapon or a fireball, but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save.<br>• Diamond Body: At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds.<br>• Diamond Soul: At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to her current monk level +10.<br>• Quivering Palm: Starting at 15h level, a monk can set up fatal vibrations within the body of another creature once per day. Unless the target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk’s level + the monk’s Wis modifier), it dies.<br>• Empty Body: At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to fade from sight twice per day. The monk gains a 50% concealment bonus for a number of rounds equal to his class level.<br>• Perfect Self: At 10th level, a monk has tuned her body with skill and quasi-magical abilities to the point that she becomes a magical creature. The monk gains damage reduction 20/magic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a non-magical weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn’t have similar damage reduction.<br><br><br><br><br><b>Paladin</b><br><br>Divine power protects the paladin and gives her special powers. It wards off harm, protects her from disease, lets her heal herself, and guards her heart against fear. A paladin can also direct this power to help others, healing their wounds or curing diseases. Finally, a paladin can use this power to destroy evil. Even a novice paladin can detect evil, and more experienced paladins can smite evil foes and turn away undead.<br><br>Class Features:<br>• Alignment Restrictions: Lawful good. Paladins must be lawful good, and they lose their divine powers if they deviate from that alignment.<br>• Hit Die: d10.<br>• Base Attack Bonus: High.<br>• High Saves: Fortitude.<br>• Weapon Proficiencies: Simple and martial weapons.<br>• Armor Proficiencies: All types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).<br>• Skill Points: (2 + Int Modifier x 4 at first level) 2 + Int modifier<br>• Class Skills: Concentration, Craft Armor, Craft Weapon, Diplomacy, Discipline, Heal, Lore, and Parry.<br>• Smite Evil: Once per day a paladin may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per paladin level. If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day. At 5th level, and at every five levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.<br>• Divine Grace: At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.<br>• Lay on Hands: Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin with a Charisma score of 12 or higher can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level times her Charisma bonus. For example, a 7th-level paladin with a 16 Charisma (+3 bonus) can heal 21 points of damage per day.<br>• Aura of Courage: Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects.<br>• Divine Health: At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases (such as mummy rot and lycanthropy).<br>• Turn Undead: When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the ability to turn undead. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She turns undead as a cleric of three levels lower would.<br>• Spells: Beginning at 4th level, a paladin gains the ability to cast a number of divine spells, which are drawn from the paladin spell list. A paladin must choose and prepare her spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 10 for 0-level spells, Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth).<br>• Remove Disease: At 6th level, a paladin can remove disease once per day. At 9th level and every three levels after that, the paladin can cure disease one more time per day.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Ranger</b><br><br>A ranger can use a variety of weapons and is quite capable in combat. His skills allow him to survive in the wilderness, to find his prey, and to avoid detection. He also has special knowledge about certain types of creatures, which makes it easier for him to find and defeat such foes. Finally, an experienced ranger has such a tie to nature that he can actually draw upon natural power to cast divine spells, much as a druid does.<br><br>Class Features:<br>• Hit Die: d8<br>• Base Attack Bonus: High.<br>• High Saves: Fortitude and Reflex.<br>• Weapon Proficiencies: Simple and martial weapons.<br>• Armor Proficiencies: Light armor and shields (except tower shields).<br>• Skill Points: (6 + Int Modifier x 4 at first level) 6 + Int modifier<br>• Class Skills: Concentration, Craft Alchemy, Craft Armor, Craft Trap, Craft Weapon, Discipline, Heal, Hide, Listen, Lore, Move Silently, Parry, Search, Set Trap, Spot, and Survival.<br>• Track: A ranger has the ability to find and read tracks, but he moves slowly when doing so.<br>• Favored Enemy: At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature as his favored enemy. The ranger gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Spot, and Taunt checks, and also a +1 bonus on weapon damage rolls against their favored enemy. At 5th level and every five levels after that, the ranger can choose an additional favored enemy and gains +1 to all favored enemy bonuses.<br>• Combat Style: At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to purse: archery or two-weapon combat. If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. The benefits of the ranger’s chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.<br>• Toughness: At 3rd level the ranger gains Toughness as a bonus feat.<br>• Animal Companion: At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal companion.<br>• Spells: Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 10 for 0-level spells, Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth).<br>• Improved Combat Style: At 6th level, a ranger’s aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Manyshot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Two-Weapon fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. As before, the benefits of the ranger’s chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.<br>• Woodland Stride: Starting at 7th level, a ranger gains a +10% movement increase when in outdoor, natural environments.<br>• Swift Tracker: At 8th level, a ranger can use their tracking skill and move at normal speed.<br>• Evasion: At 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or a fireball), he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light or no armor.<br>• Combat Mastery: At 11th level, a ranger’s aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves again. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. As before, the benefits of the ranger’s chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.<br>• Camouflage: At 13th level the ranger does not suffer a movement penalty for using stealth mode when in outdoor areas.<br>• Hide in Plain Sight: When outdoors, a 17th level ranger has the ability to use the Hide skill even when being watched and in combat.<br><br><br><br><br><b>Rogue</b><br><br>Rogues are highly skilled, and they can concentrate on developing any of several categories of skills. While not equal to members of many other classes in combat, a rogue knows how to hit where it hurts, and she can dish out a lot of damage with a sneak attack. Rogues also have a sixth sense when it comes to avoiding danger. Experienced rogues develop mystical powers and skills as they master the arts of stealth, evasion, and sneak attacks. In addition, while not capable of casting spells on their own, rogues can “fake it” well enough to cast spells from scrolls, activate wands, and use just about any other magic item.<br><br>Class Features:<br>• Hit Die: d6<br>• Base Attack Bonus: Medium.<br>• High Saves: Reflex.<br>• Weapon Proficiencies: Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, shortbow, and short sword.<br>• Armor Proficiencies: Light armor.<br>• Skill Points: (8 + Int Modifier x 4 at first level) 8 + Int modifier<br>• Class Skills: Appraise, Bluff, Craft Alchemy, Craft Trap, Craft Weapon, Diplomacy, Disable Device, Hide, Intimidate, Listen, Lore, Move Silently, Open Lock, Parry, Search, Set Trap, Sleight of Hand, Spot, Taunt, Tumble, and Use Magic Device.<br>• Sneak Attack: If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter.<br>• Trapfinding: Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.<br>• Evasion: At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or a fireball), she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor.<br>• Trap Sense: At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level.<br>• Uncanny Dodge: Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even is she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.<br>• Improved Uncanny Dodge: At 8th level a rogue cannot be sneak attacked by another rogue unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target.<br>• Special Abilities: On attaining 10th level, and at every three levels thereafter (13th, 16th, 19th), a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among the following options.<br>- Crippling Strike (Ex): A rogue with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage.<br>- Defensive Roll (Ex): The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow; not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll-if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can’t use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue’s evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.<br>- Improved Evasion (Ex): This ability works like evasion, except that while the rogue still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks such as a dragon’s breath weapon or a fireball, henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save.<br>- Opportunist (Ex): The rogue automatically gains a +4 competence bonus to attack rolls when making an attack of opportunity.<br>- Skill Mastery. The rogue cannot roll less than 5 whenever using the Disable Device, Open Lock, or Set Trap skills, even if in combat.<br>- Slippery Mind (Ex): this ability represents the rogue’s ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she automatically gets one reroll.<br>- Feat: A rogue may gain a bonus feat in place of a special ability.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Sorcerer</b><br><br>Sorcerers cast spells through innate power rather than through careful training and study. Their magic is intuitive rather than logical. Sorcerers know fewer spells than wizards do and acquire powerful spells more slowly than wizards, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare their spells ahead of time. Sorcerers do not specialize in certain schools of magic the way wizards sometimes do. Since sorcerers gain their powers without undergoing the years of rigorous study that wizards go through, they don’t have the background of arcane knowledge that most wizards have. However, they do have more time to learn fighting skills, and they are proficient with simple weapons.<br><br>Class Features:<br>• Hit Die: d4<br>• Base Attack Bonus: Low.<br>• High Saves: Will.<br>• Weapon Proficiencies: Simple weapons.<br>• Armor Proficiencies: None. Armor of any type interferes with a sorcerer’s arcane gestures, which can cause his spells to fail.<br>• Skill Points: (2 + Int Modifier x 4 at first level) 2 + Int modifier<br>• Class Skills: Bluff, Concentration, Craft Alchemy, Lore, and Spellcraft.<br>• Spells: A sorcerer casts arcane spells, which are drawn primarily from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell a sorcerer must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 10 for 0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth).<br>• Familiar: A sorcerer can obtain a familiar.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Warlock</b><br><br>Born of a supernatural bloodline, a warlock seeks to master the perilous magic that suffuses his soul. Unlike wizards, who approach arcane magic through the medium of spells, a warlock invokes powerful magic through nothing more than an effort of will. The font of dark magic burning in their soul makes them resistant to many forms of attack and arms them with dangerous power. Warlocks learn to harness their power to perform a small number of specific attacks and tricks called invocations. Warlocks make up for their lack of versatility by being tougher and more resilient than sorcerers or wizards.<br><br>Class Features:<br>• Alignment Restrictions: Any evil or any chaotic.<br>• Hit Die: d6<br>• Base Attack Bonus: Medium.<br>• High Saves: Will.<br>• Weapon Proficiencies: Simple weapons.<br>• Armor Proficiencies: Light armor. A warlock can use any of his invocations while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. A warlock wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure.<br>• Skill Points: (2 + Int Modifier x 4 at first level) 2 + Int modifier<br>• Class Skills: Bluff, Concentration, Craft Alchemy, Craft Armor, Craft Trap, Craft Weapon, Heal, Intimidate, Lore, Spellcraft, Taunt, and Use Magic Device.<br>• Invocations: A warlock does not prepare or cast spells as other wielders of arcane magic do. Instead, he possesses a repertoire of attacks, defenses, and abilities known as invocations that require him to focus the wild energy that suffuses his soul. A warlock can use any invocation he knows at will.<br>• Eldritch Blast: A warlock attacks his foes with eldritch power, using baleful magical energy to deal damage and sometimes impart other debilitating effects. An eldritch blast deals 1d6 points of damage at 1st level and increases in power as the warlock rises in level. There is no saving throw with this attack, but spell resistance can negate it. This power can be used at will.<br>• Eldritch Lore: At 2nd level the warlock gains a +2 bonus to his Lore and Spellcraft skills.<br>• Damage Reduction: Fortified by the supernatural power flowing in his body, a warlock becomes resistant to physical attacks at 3rd level and above, gaining damage reduction 1/cold iron (damage from attacks are reduced by 1 point unless the damage comes from cold iron). At 7th level and every four levels thereafter, a warlock’s damage reduction improves.<br>• Deceive Item: At 4th level, a warlock gains a +4 bonus to his Use Magic Device skill.<br>• Fiendish Resilience: Beginning at 8th level, a warlock can activate this ability once per day. For 20 rounds, the warlock heals 1 hit point a round. This improves at 13th level to 2 hit points of healing a round, then at 18th level it becomes 5 hit points a round.<br>• Energy Resistance: At 10th level and higher, a warlock has resistance 5 against any two of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic.

Unless otherwise noted, the eldritch blast does normal damage.<br><br><br><br><br><b>Wizard</b><br><br>The wizard’s strength is her spells. Everything else is secondary. She learns new spells as she experiments and grows in experience, and she can also learn them from other wizards. In addition to learning new spells, a wizard can, over time, learn to manipulate her spells so they go farther, work better, or are improved in some other way. Some wizards prefer to specialize in a certain type of magic. Specialization makes a wizard more powerful in her chosen field, but it denies her access to some of the spells that lie outside that field.<br><br>Class Features:<br>• Hit Die: d4<br>• Base Attack Bonus: Low.<br>• High Saves: Will.<br>• Weapon Proficiencies: Wizards are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff.<br>• Armor Proficiencies: None. Armor of any type interferes with a wizard’s movements, which can cause her spells to fail.<br>• Skill Points: (2 + Int Modifier x 4 at first level) 2 + Int modifier<br>• Class Skills: Concentration, Craft Alchemy, Craft Armor, Craft Weapon, Lore, and Spellcraft.<br>• Spells: A wizard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. A wizard must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time. To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Int 10 for 0-level spells, Int 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth).<br>• Bonus Feats: At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity she can choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat, or Spell Mastery. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.<br>• Familiar: A wizard can obtain a familiar.<br>• Spellbook: A wizard must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook. A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from her prohibited school or schools, if any) plus three 1st-level spells of your choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the wizard has, the spellbook holds one additional 1st-level spell of your choice. At each new wizard level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new wizard level) for her spellbook. For example, when a wizard attains 5th level, she can cast 3rd-level spells. At this point, she can add two new 3rd-level spells toher spellbook, or one 2nd-level spell and one 3rd-level spell, or any combination of two spells between 1st and 3rd level. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards’ spellbooks to her own.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Now she takes only half damage even on failed Reflex saves.<br><br><b>War Priest</b><br><br>(PRESTIGE CLASS)<br><br>Requirements:<br>• Base Attack Bonus: +5<br>• Spellcasting: Able to cast 4th level divine spells.<br>• Skills: Diplomacy 8 ranks, Spot 5 ranks.<br>• Feats: Combat Casting.<br><br>Class Features:<br>• Hit Die: d10<br>• Base Attack Bonus: High<br>• High Saves: Fortitude<br>• Weapon Proficiencies: Simple and martial weapons.<br>• Armor Proficiencies: All armors (light, medium, and heavy), and all shields (including tower shields).<br>• Skill Points: 2 + Int modifier<br>• Class Skills: Concentration, Craft Alchemy, Craft Armor, Craft Weapon, Diplomacy, Discipline, Heal, Intimidate, Lore, Parry, Spellcraft, and Taunt.<br>• Divine Spellcasting: At each even-numbered level, warpriests gain new spells per day and an added level of effective spellcasting in whatever divine spellcasting class gave them access to 4th-level divine spells when becoming a warpriest. If a character has multiple classes that give him access to 4th-level divine spells, he must choose which spellcasting class will benefit from warpriest levels when first selecting this prestige class.<br>• War Glory: All allies within 10’ of the warpriest have +1 to hit, though the warpriest himself does not gain this bonus. All enemis within the same ranger suffer a -1 morale penalty to saving throws and this penalty cannot be resisted in any way (though leaving the radius instantly cancels the effect). This power is always active.<br>• Inflame: Starting at 2nd level, a warpriest can use this ability to grant himself and all allies within 40’ a bonus to saving throws vs. fear and mind effects for five rounds. This bonus is +2 at level 2 and becomes +4 at level 4, +6 at level 6, and +8 at level 10.<br>• Remove Fear: A warpriest may cast the remove fear spell once per day per level of warpriest.<br>• Mass cure light wounds: Upon reaching 3rd level, a warpriest may cast mass cure light wounds once per day as a spell-like ability.

Foes must make a Will save (DC 10 + warpriest class level + Charisma modifier) or be affected by the fear spell. This power can be used once per day.<br>• Battletide: At 6th level, a warpriest can cast battletide as a spell-like ability once per day. The warpriests’s class level is used to determine the caster level of this spell.<br>• Haste: At 7th level, a warpriest can cast haste as a spell-like ability three times per day. The warpriest’s class level is used to determine the caster level of this spell.<br>• Mass Heal: At 9th level, a warpriest can cast mass heal as a spell-like ability once per day. The warpriest’s class level is used to determine the caster level of this spell.<br>• Implacable Foe: At 10th level, a warpriest can bestow all allies within 30’ (though not himself) an extra +20 hit points. This ability halves the warpriests’s movement for 10 rounds. After ten rounds, all recipients lose 20 hit points. This ability may be used once per day.<br><br><b>Weapon Master</b><br><br>(PRESTIGE CLASS)<br><br>Requirements:<br>• Base Attack Bonus: +5<br>• Feats: Weapon Focus in a melee weapon, Dodge, Mobility, Combat Expertise, Spring Attack, and Whirlwind Attack.<br>• Skills: Intimidate 4 or more ranks.<br><br>Class Features:<br>• Hit Die: d10<br>• Base Attack Bonus: High.<br>• High Saves: Reflex<br>• Weapon Proficiencies: None.<br>• Armor Proficiencies: None.<br>• Skill Points: 2 + Int modifier<br>• Class Skills: Craft Weapon, Discipline, Intimidate, Lore, Parry, and Taunt.<br>• Weapon of Choice: When a character acquires his first level of weapon master, he must select a single melee weapon type (for example, longsword or dwarven waraxe) as his weapon of choice.

If this attack hits, it automatically inflicts maximum damage.<br>• Increase Multiplier: At 5th level, the weapon master’s critical multiplier with his chosen weapon increases by +1. (i.e. x2 becomes x3, x3 becomes x4, etc.).<br>• Superior Weapon Focus: A 5th level weapon master gains Superior Weapon Focus with his weapon of choice as a bonus feat.<br>• Ki Critical: At 7th level, the weapon master increases his threat range by 2 when using his weapon of choice. For example, a longsword normally has a threat range of 19-20. In the hands of a 7th level weapon master, it threatens on a 17-20. This ability does not stack with the Improved Critical feat or with any spell or effect that increases a weapon’s threat range.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Good Job CD.  Much easier to reference.<br><br>Looking through this more carefully, I see that the WMs ki critical isn't going to stack with improved critical or keen.  Looks like until epic levels are added, WM just became completely useless class.  War priest and Duelist look limited as well.  Pretty much the only builds that look good for War Priest are Cleric 10/War Priest 10 and Druid 10/War Priest 10.  The latter might be interesting but a Cleric 20 would appear to be better than the multiclassed Cleric/War Priest (have to see the cleric spells though).  Without epic levels, I don't think I could see a build that would benefit from duelist other than a Rogue/ Fighter/ Duelist.  When we get epic levels, a Wizard/Rogue/Duelist/Eldrich Knight would be a terrible opponent.  Too bad they couldn't add the spell lists for the blackguard and assassin.  Any word on whether the Warlock's magic would qualify for arcane archer and pale master?<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Thanks Mith (and thanks to whoever stickied this thread).<br><br>Definitely agree on the WM (completely useless) and Duelist. As for the Warpriest, I can see taking only 7 levels, so 13 CLC/7 WP for level 8 spells, or maybe something like CLC 9/WP 7/FTR 4.<br><br>From what I've read, it looks like the Warlock won't qualify you for AA, AT, PM, or RDD.<br><br>I'm a little concerned about PM as well, as there is no mention of increased caster level for PM levels, but there <i>is</i> mention of it in the Eldritch Knight description. Perhaps it's just an oversight, but I've a feeling it may turn out to be the same as the NWN implementation. Hopefully not though.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

More on the KD/Discipline changes:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 08/22/06 23:49:31 (GMT) by Andy Woo<br><br>Any special attack that uses Discipline as an opposed check is out.  There were only two that were not cut: Disarm and Knockdown.  There used to be Sap and Called Shot but those are not in the game.<br><br>Knockdown and Disarm do not do damage anymore.<br><br>Knockdown is an opposed roll of attacker's STR plus (attacker's size - defender's size) * 4 against the the defender's STR or DEX, whichever is higher.  +4 stability for dwarves/4-legged animals, is NOT in.  Knockdown does not draw AoOs, nor do you need to do a touch attack to initiate it.  There is no counter-trip.  Improved Knockdown makes the attacker seem one size larger.  You can only knockdown a creature one size larger than you or smaller.  It uses up one of your attacks in a round.<br><br>Disarm draws attacks of opportunity and does no damage.  It uses up one of your attacks in the round.  The attacker makes an opposed attack roll against the defender modified by (attacker's size - defender's size) * 4, and the relative weapon size * 4.  The defender opposes with an attack roll against the attacker modified by his relative weapon size * 4.  NWN2 uses a hybrid 3.5/3.0 weapon size system that I'm not going into right now.  If the attacker wins, the on-hand item, if any, is dropped on the ground.  Improved Disarm does not draw AoOs and puts the on-hand item in the attacker's inventory.<br><br>This is as close as it's going to get, folks.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

No, it's about NWN2 the game, the NWN2 Vault crew have received this info directly from Atari/Obsidian it seems.

The reason for the delay is the need to fix bugs. Check this out (J.E.

NWN2 feat lists at the vault: <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=NWN2GameInfo.list&amp;category_select_id=5" target="_blank">Click Here</a>.<br><br>Not sure if it's completely accurate, of course, but there's some interesting stuff there. I immediately thought of a Bard character with the Artist background (+2 Perform and +3 Bard Songs per day) with the Extra Music feat. You could sing non-stop all day!<br><br>Spellcasters are getting some loving as well. Background feat of Spellcasting Prodigy (Bonus spell(s) and spells are slightly harder for enemies to resist.) and the Extra Slot feat (cast an extra spell) will be an interesting combo.<br><br>Or Mind Over Body background (Int and metamagic feats increase Hit Points instead of Con).<br><br>Item creation feats are in as well, apparently: <i>Craft Magical Arms and Armor</i> and <i>Craft Wondrous Item</i>.<br><br>Nifty.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 09/23/06 01:21</span></i></p>

In the OP, with the enlarged party, Bard may be a fun class to play. Particularly if you are Human (Able Learner) and take a level of Rogue.

With all of the information out on NWN2, do you think it would be a good idea to start a NWN2 build forum for the guild here?<br><br>It could even be a pre-release build forum that could be transferred over to the NWN2 section once the game is released.<br><br>I know that I'm already starting to look at build ideas, and I'm sure that there are hundreds of others doing the same <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

I had chopiness to start with, but then I found out that I missed a drivers update.  NVidia posted new ones on Nov. 2nd with improvements that help a lot with NWN2.  After I installed the new drivers and disabled Water Reflections and Refractions, the chopiness went away.<br><br>My system:<br>AMD X2 3800+ (2 GHz x 2)<br>FoxConn (WinFast) NF4SK8AA SLI Motherboard<br>1 GB PC3200 Geil Value RAM<br>eVGA 7900 GT (Factory OC 500 MHz GPU/1500 MHz RAM)<br><br>Sorry about the response to the hijack... :/<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Ythaniel on 11/10/06 17:40</span></i></p>
