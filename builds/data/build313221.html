Oh the cruel twisted hand of fate, how could poor young Eeddy cope in the harshest of environments on the great steppes .. his weedy and fragile body not just wracked with the incessant cold but the constant pounding he received from his peers for being 'different'. And different he was. In a land where brute power and the ability to go ape-sh*t in battle was the norm, Eddy was at a distinct disadvantage. He just didnt have the disposition for it.<br><br>Some say it was because he was dropped at birth, some say it was the gods cruel joke but Eddy was a fragile runt. Yet he survived. He had to learn all sorts of tricks, slinking out of danger, his senses keener than most, twisting and turning away from the frenetic blows that would eviscerate -nay- annihilate a lesser being.<br><br>And so time passed, Eddy grew up and finally found his way into an organisation that protect their own. His senses highly tuned, his combat mastery lay with quick lethal stabs and ripostes, striking from the shadows and reflexes so highly strung he could evade the mightiest blows.<br><br>And yet when pressured, when the screws were really turned and the situations he (constantly) seemed to find himself in turned diabolical, an inner rage surfaced (as evidenced in the form of a frothy oral discharge and his eyeballs rolling back)and Eddy just *lost* the plot. His adversaries generally didnt know whether to laugh or cry at the sight of this scrawny runt going bananas - but in the seconds it took for the insanity to take grip and the split second people took to think "what the.." they were either dead, petrified or severely distrubed. Usually with a brown mess in their britches. eww the shame.<br><br>So with this background I present Unsteady Eddy, the scrawny Barbarian outcast. Love him or hate him, he is most definitely a unique, one of a kind, never to be repeated object of wonder.<br><br><br>Rogue(19), Barbarian(16), Harper Scout(5), Elf (Drow would be good)<br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 18 (34)<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 14<br><br>Elf: (Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Keen Sense, Low-light Vision, Skill Affinity: Listen, Skill Affinity: Search, Skill Affinity: Spot, Sleeplessness, Weapon Proficiency Elf)<br>01: Rogue(1): Alertness, {Armor Proficiency Light, Weapon Proficiency Rogue}<br>02: Barbarian(1): {Armor Proficiency Medium, Shield, Weapon Proficiency Simple, Weapon Proficiency Martial, Barbarian Endurance, Barbarian Rage I}<br>03: Barbarian(2): Weapon Finesse, {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>04: Rogue(2): DEX+1, {Evasion}, (DEX=19)<br>05: Barbarian(3)<br>06: Barbarian(4): Knockdown, {Barbarian Rage II}<br>07: Rogue(3)<br>08: Rogue(4): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>09: Barbarian(5): Weapon Focus: Rapier, {Uncanny Dodge II}<br>10: Rogue(5)<br>11: Barbarian(6)<br>12: Rogue(6): DEX+1, Improved Critical: Rapier, (DEX=21)<br>13: Barbarian(7)<br>14: Rogue(7)<br>15: Barbarian(8): Iron Will, {Barbarian Rage III}<br>16: Barbarian(9): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>17: Rogue(8)<br>18: Barbarian(10): Blind Fight, {Uncanny Dodge III}<br>19: Barbarian(11): {Damage Reduction I}<br>20: Barbarian(12): DEX+1, {Barbarian Rage IV}, (DEX=23)<br>21: Rogue(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Rapier<br>22: Rogue(10): Improved Evasion<br>23: Harper Scout(1): Great Dexterity I, {Bardic Knowledge}, (DEX=24)<br>24: Rogue(11): DEX+1, Epic Skill Focus: Discipline, (DEX=25)<br>25: Rogue(12)<br>26: Barbarian(13): {Uncanny Dodge IV}<br>27: Rogue(13): Great Dexterity II, Defensive Roll, (DEX=26)<br>28: Barbarian(14): DEX+1, {Damage Reduction II}, (DEX=27)<br>29: Rogue(14)<br>30: Barbarian(15): Terrifying Rage, {Barbarian Rage V}<br>31: Rogue(15)<br>32: Rogue(16): DEX+1, Epic Dodge, (DEX=28)<br>33: Rogue(17): Great Dexterity III, {Uncanny Dodge V}, (DEX=29)<br>34: Harper Scout(2): {Deneir's Eye, Sleep}<br>35: Harper Scout(3): {Cat's Grace, Tymora's Smile}<br>36: Harper Scout(4): DEX+1, Great Dexterity IV, {Eagle's Splendor, Lliira's Heart}, (DEX=31)<br>37: Harper Scout(5): Great Dexterity V, {Craft Harper Item, Invisibility (Harper)}, (DEX=32)<br>38: Rogue(18)<br>39: Barbarian(16): Great Dexterity VI, {Barbarian Rage VI}, (DEX=33)<br>40: Rogue(19): DEX+1, Epic Skill Focus: Intimidate, (DEX=34)<br><br>Hitpoints: 376<br>Skillpoints: 346<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/17/32<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +4, Traps: +10<br>BAB: 28<br>AB (max, naked): 43 (melee), 40 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 30/33<br>Spell Casting: <br>Alignment Changes: 0<br><br>Craft Weapon 1(3), Disable Trap 1(3), Discipline 42(52), Hide 43(55), Intimidate 43(55), Listen 43(46), Lore 6(13), Move Silently 43(55), Open Lock 1(13), Persuade 8(10), Pick Pocket 1(13), Search 40(44), Set Trap 1(13), Tumble 43(55), UMD 28(30), remaining skillpoints 2<br><br><br>Pulse Cap doesnt show anything with the same class combo.<br><br>The concept is a Dex Barbarian. Yup. A toon that can self buff STR, CON, DEX and CHA. And make use of all 4 attributes.

Interesting.  I have often used barbarian rage to help me carry stuff, but never really got into a Dex build with that feature (though I did make an Int build).

Actually, come to think of it, why not halfling with a mace or kukri.  There is no XP penalty, better AC and AB from size modifier, and the same initial stats.  Further you don't have much going for crits when compared to sneaks, so a decreased range might not be all that disadvantageous when compared to a higher AB and the rare bludgeoning damage (which becomes the damage type for your sneak attack bonuses).

I guess 'halfling' fits in nicely with the concept too .. a stunted little specimen. <br><br>In this sense hes not really a halfling per se, just using the halfling 'race' to simulate the cruel joke perpetrated on him by the gods.<br><br>Mace is always a fall-back option for any slasher/piercer for dealing with undead, golems etc. Wether I would build the toon around mace depends on the environment i guess, but the comment is certainly valid for most builds. I have been choosing more bludgeon dmg recently in general too. Rapier here was more for the concept given that he is not built for crits.<br><br>Not sure what to drop for Exotic feat to fit in kukri, I would 9 out of 10 times prefer to go with shortswords anyway. More plenty to be found and horded, and usually a cool selection of bonii to fulfill any special tasks.
