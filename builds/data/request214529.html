Alternatively take the 10th rdd last, but your AB will suffer until lvl 40.  You're probably not going to be able to get a lot of great smites in without loosing quite a bit of str though - 4 or 5 is probably the max.  You'll be stuck with just paladin spells too, but the duration should be good.  The 25 CHA requirement for great smite are a pain when you want to keep str high, hence calling on RDD to boost the strength and chr simultaneously.<br><br>Quick two second build, note it has horribly low HPs and probably a bunch of other problems I havent noticed:<br><br>Paladin(26), Red Dragon Disciple(11), Bard(3), Human<br>	<br>STR: 16 (28)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 10 (12)<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 12 (14)<br>CHA: 15 (25)<br><br>Human: (Quick to Master)<br>01: Paladin(1): Toughness, Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>02: Paladin(2): P: (Smite Evil)<br>03: Paladin(3): Power Attack<br>04: Paladin(4): CHA+1, (CHA=16)<br>05: Paladin(5)<br>06: Paladin(6): Divine Might<br>07: Paladin(7)<br>08: Paladin(8): CHA+1, (CHA=17)<br>09: Paladin(9): Divine Shield<br>10: Paladin(10)<br>11: Paladin(11)<br>12: Paladin(12): CHA+1, Improved Critical: Greatsword, (CHA=18)<br>13: Paladin(13)<br>14: Paladin(14)<br>15: Paladin(15): Extra Smiting<br>16: Paladin(16): CHA+1, (CHA=19)<br>17: Paladin(17)<br>18: Paladin(18): Blind Fight<br>19: Paladin(19)<br>20: Paladin(20): CHA+1, (CHA=20)<br>21: Bard(1): Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>22: Red Dragon Disciple(1)<br>23: Red Dragon Disciple(2): (STR=18)<br>24: Red Dragon Disciple(3): CHA+1, Epic Prowess, (CHA=21)<br>25: Red Dragon Disciple(4): (STR=20)<br>26: Red Dragon Disciple(5)<br>27: Red Dragon Disciple(6): Great Strength I, (STR=21)<br>28: Red Dragon Disciple(7): CHA+1, (CON=12), (CHA=22)<br>29: Red Dragon Disciple(8)<br>30: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Great Charisma I, (INT=14), (CHA=23)<br>31: Red Dragon Disciple(10): RDD: (Darkvision), (STR=25), (CHA=25)<br>32: Paladin(21): STR+1, (STR=26)<br>33: Paladin(22): Great Smite I<br>34: Paladin(23): Great Smite II<br>35: Paladin(24)<br>36: Paladin(25): STR+1, Great Smite III, (STR=27)<br>37: Bard(2)<br>38: Bard(3)<br>39: Paladin(26): Great Smite IV, Great Smite V<br>40: Red Dragon Disciple(11): STR+1, (STR=28)<br><br>Discipline 43(52), Listen 43(45), Perform 2(9), Spot 43(45), Tumble 40(39), UMD 17(24)<br><br>Hitpoints: 454<br>Skillpoints: 188<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 30/25/22<br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 43 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 21/32<br>Spell Casting: Paladin(4),Bard(1)<br><br>The AB is into normal fighter territory, plus you have bulls, bless, prayer, aid, holy sword/GMW, divine favour, even a +1 from bard song to boost things a bit.

Bard RDD CoT would do a lot of divine damage with divine Wrath for a number of rounds equal to cha bonus. It really kicks up that AB in the epic levels too.

Smiting isn't really a great idea for PvP IMHO unless the server you're on is restricted alignment wise. If alignment shifts are possible everyone's going to be neutral.  For PvM though smiting is very useful if you're playing on a server with evil/good "Bosses" since you can do goodish damage working your way to the Boss and then kill it in 2/3 hits.  Something like pal/cot will give you the opportunity to get more Great Smites in and so do more damage with smites but your AB will suffer quite a bit due to not getting the RDD str bonuses.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By jwlademann on 10/01/05 00:16</span></i></p>

As far as i know, BoW doesn't allow neutral alignments, and jwlademann's build looks good, except that the server will only let you go up to greater smiting 3 with a pally or CoT, and greater smiting 4 with blackguard

I tested it and you can get the AB with divine wrath into the 60's with BoW items. Also, the devcrit dc on such a character can reach 50 with said items and still do plenty of damage with a keen longsword or rapier. Go elf and you get them as bonus feats AND get listen/spot as an "always on" ability. AC tops out around 50 hasted and saving throws are superb.
