<i>First build I've ever attempted to post</i><br><br><br><br><b>DESCRIPTION</b>:<br><br>The aim of this build is to present a playable character focused on fighting in the iron golem form bestowed by the 9th level arcane spell Shapechange. I tried to address the lack of AB presented by such builds by squeezing in as much pre-epic BAB as I could (16) and adding monk for an improved attack schedule.  Another obstacle is presented by the inability to merge any items into this spell-shifted form.  I tried to address the loss of item AC with epic mage armor.  Blackguard is included to help with pre-epic AB and make full use of his casting stat thru divine dmg and divine shield and improved saves.  Divine might and sneak attack helps somewhat to alleviate the lack of dmg reduction penetration of this spell-shifted form. <br><br>I searched Pulse Cap's Engine for similar builds but the only one with this combination of classes was <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "141904", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Defiler Of The Silt Sea (Monk 6 / BG 2 / Sorc 32)</a> <i>by Darchen</i> and is more of a pure sorceror intended for PvP and does not take advantage of divine might/shield.  After starting to type out this build, I noticed a build called <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "244978", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Buff of the Jungle (Druid 20 / Monk 2 / Cleric 18)</a> <i>by Thaxll'ssyllia</i> that fights in Earth Elemental form with many of the same immunities and divine buffs as this one.  Buff is a better build.  Divine Power combined with the various other clerical AB buffs and outdoor druid AB bonus combine to make a more effective fighter.  It is also more playable at all stages of development, whereas the Infernal Iron Fist doesnt hit his stride until lvl 33 and doesn't shine until lvl 39.  However since we arrived at a similar destination through different means I would like to still post mine. <br><br><br><br><br><br><i><b>THE INFERNAL IRON FIST - SORCERER (21), MONK (6), BLACKGUARD(13)</b></i><br><i>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Lawful Evil<br>Playable 1-40 PVM.

This build will struggle against well-made/played PVP casters as well as fast AA's, but it took out the prismatic dragon in my leveller with no gear.<br><br>Any comments or suggestions for improvement (possibly AB or feat/spell selection) are welcome.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 05/27/10 21:16</span></i></p>

Welcome and thanks for sharing your build. Interesting build idea you got here. <br><br>It's painful to see 3 pre-epic feats used in epic slots (spell penetration, greater spell penetration, and improved critical). I'm not sure how much the Spell Penetration line of feats actually helps this build anyways. <br><br>I cant really add anything more right now (have to tend to the little one). I'm sure others will be along shortly to give you their recommendations on how to make your build stronger.

I like the focus and committment.  It takes this guy a while to get where he wants to go.  The only regret is that I wish you had just a wee bit more Sorc levels.  Not sure how to do that given your nice pre-epic 16BAB.  You'd have to sack either Monk or BG levels, and there ain't a whole lot of those.  Speaking of levels, you have BG16 listed in the thread title.  <br><br>Good one, and cool name.

Thank you Kail Pendragon for editing this, I didn't realize how choppy my post must have looked until I see the new version.  Thanks for the comments everyone.<br><br>@Galabriel - Maybe the SP line is a bit too little too late, but I wanted to try and give him a fighting chance to cast his offensive spells against those with toolset level SR. <br><br>But I don't know what else I could do with those feats. I could apply 2 of them to charisma, but 28 is probably enough for this build, considering that fully buffed in golem form he has already hit the dodge cap without the need for DS.  Maybe epic toughness to help him survive an ambush in human form?.<br><br>@GrizzledDwarfLord - More sorc lvls would be nice.  The easiest way to implement them might be to sacrifice one attack, IKD, and 1AB by substituting 2 sorc for monk pre epic and another monk in epic (keep one to top off tumble)...that gets you to 24.  One could then sacrafice 2 lvls of BG in epic (keep one to top off taunt), and pick up EP where I picked up ESP and pick up ESP with one of your new sorc Bonus feats (26 sorc lvls now).  Still one epic bonus feat left to spend.<br><br>This split would be a more effective caster but I like having IKD in golem form...I can actually KD dragons(the weak kind)....its really fun.

Thank you for speaking so nicely about my build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  and welcome to the guild.  <br><br>Hmmm, depending on the playstyle, Still Spell could be rendered useless. Since you're a shifted Monk (and don't merge items), an armor won't do any good, on the other side, since your WIS is so low, it might help playability before reaching the shift, so in the end it depends if you're playing it from level 1 or not. Also tied to playability, Toughness becomes irrelevant once you get the Golem form, just look at your HP.<br><br>Perhaps it would be somewhat more playable to take Divine Might and Shield sooner, it seems you'll be a buffer all the time, so the Still and Empower Spell won't be so decisive when your Sorcerer level is just 6.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;SKILLS<br>Concentration 43, Craft Armor 15(17), Discipline 43(45), Spellcraft 38(40), Taunt 43(62), Tumble 40</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Wait... and what about those 5 ranks in Hide?<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Normal weapon (Scimitar?) </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>You could try kama...<br><br>Being dispelled might be a concerning issue, but you just have to live with it.

@thax<br><br>-  You are correct about toughness and still spell being taken pre-epic to help playability.  Although still spell won't really be useful until around lvl 22.  I realize that this build will not be the easiest to level up, but its not intended to be just a straight to 40th build.  <br><br>-  From lvls 1-7 it should be able to level up like any other sorcerer.<br><br>there is a rough patch from 8-10 where additional monk levels don't really add anything yet.<br><br>From 11-20 you are playing it as fighter with low hitpoints but the ability to cast longterm buffs like bulls/stack bulls, flameweapon, protection from elements, mage armor/shield etc.  Blackguard also gives you access to nifty pets like the succubus (evards,fear,dispel/chainlightning) and the doomknight (bladebarrier/dispel/fearaura).<br><br>-  The reason I take divine shield and divine might with my last two pre-epic feats is that I can't take them any earlier with my level split....they aren't available until my 3rd level of blackguard and I can't take blackguard until BAB reaches 6.<br><br>-  the skill point total is actually 227 and I just forgot to list hide.<br><br> -  Thank your for the kama suggestion for weapon....I think that is probably the best one as it maximizes my attacks and dmg from flame weapon.<br><br>-  In addition, I'm taking two more lvls of sorc in epic so that the split is 23/6/11.  This allows me to take sorc 21 at 36th lvl and get epic mage armor a little bit earlier.  I am taking Epic Prowress on the level that I took Epic Spell Penetration.  And I am taking epic spell penetration as a bonus feat on my final sorcere lvl, ESF taunt will have to wait until 39th lvl.  The new lvl progression should look like...<br><br>lvl 34 (sorc19)<br>lvl 35 (sorc20)<br>lvl 36 (sorc21) EMA (chr+1 27)<br>lvl 37 (monk6)<br>lvl 38 (sorc22)<br>lvl 39 (BG 11) ESF taunt<br>lvl 40 (sorc23) Epic Spell Penetration (chr+1 28)<br><br>As a result, I will lose one point of discipline and taunt and those 2 will go into craft armor I suppose.<br><br>-  I am going to play this guy from level 1 onwards in a fast levelling module (an early prototype of infinitedungons called endless nights 3) and see how it goes.

Please smack me if this is out of line, but what about changing Sorcerer altogether?  What about going the Druid route, which also gets the Shapechange spell.  It seems that doing this would alleviate a lot of the problems that you had with the original.  For example, if you look at the stuff below, it looks like a completely different build, but essentially it's your concept and idea, and I merely substituted Sorc for Druid (I also checked the Search Engine, and I didn't find anything, which in itself means nothing, but better than not checking):<br><br>Druid28/Monk7/BG5<br><br>Str14<br>Int10<br>Wis16 (20)<br>Dex8<br>Con14 <br>Chr14 (26)<br><br>1 Druid1, Power Attack, Extend Spell<br>2 Monk1<br>3 Druid2, WF: Unarmed<br>4 Druid3, Wis17<br>5 Druid4<br>6 Druid5, Blindfighting<br>7 Monk2<br>8 Druid6, Wis18<br>9 Druid7, Empower Spell<br>10 BG1<br>11 BG2<br>12 BG3, Divine Might, Wis19<br>13 Druid8<br>14 Druid9<br>15 BG4, Divine Shield<br>16 Druid10, Chr15<br>17 Monk3<br>18 Druid11, Improved Critical: Unarmed Strike<br>19 Druid12<br>20 Monk4, Chr16<br>21 Druid13, Great Chr I<br>22 Monk5<br>23 Druid14<br>24 Druid15, Great Chr II, Chr19<br>25 Druid16 <br>26 Druid17(Shapechange)<br>27 Monk6, Great Chr III<br>28 Druid18, Chr21<br>29 Druid19 <br>30 Druid20, Great Chr IV, (Elder Elemental)<br>31 Druid21<br>32 Druid22, Chr23<br>33 Druid23, Great Chr V<br>34 Druid24, Greater Ruin<br>35 Druid25<br>36 Druid26, EWF: Unarmed Strike, Chr25<br>37 Druid27<br>38 Druid28, Great Wis I<br>39 BG5, Epic Prowess<br>40 Monk7, Chr26<br><br>BAB: 26<br>Unarmed AB: 32<br>Iron Golem AB: 40<br><br>Pre-Shift Saves: <br>Fort: 36 (44)<br>Will: 36 (44)<br>Reflex: 26 (34)<br><br>Skills: <br>Concentration: 43<br>Tumble: 40<br>Taunt: 42 (50)<br>Spellcraft: 40<br>Discipline: 43<br><br>Advantages:  <br>Shapechange much earlier, with the added bonus of Elder Elemental<br>Buffs are now undispellable<br>Much higher AB while In Golem mode<br>Golem mode lasts longer<br>Only loses 2 charisma compared to original build.<br>More Hit points<br>Better Saves<br>Even though has Int10, still gets as many skill points as the Sorc version due to so many Druid levels.<br>Still has high Taunt score<br>Gets IKD earlier<br>Gets DM/DS earlier<br>No need for Still Spell, he's Divine Caster<br>Gets to throw his Wisdom into AC (which works great with Owls Insight)<br><br>Disadvantages:  <br>Doesn't get as many Shapechange spells per day (but can go into Elemental Mode)<br>Spell DCs aren't as great, but I don't think he would need high DCs.

Truth is, even if I had known about Druid access to the shapechange spell, I would have been intimitated by the necessary alignment shifts.  You have somehow managed to make them as easy as possible though.  The 1st and 3rd will be as simple as killing all those city slickers who despoil nature.  The second is a little trickier, but there are enough levels in between to stuff some good deeds into my alignment credit account....if necessary I'll even decline some of those item/money rewards.

I totally forgot about alignments.  Can't believe I did that.  Sigh.  I forget that Druids have to be Neutral and Monks have to be Lawful.

Heh, I've tried the Druid / Monk / Blackguard as well as the Paladin version. Yeah, alignment change was one of the big reasons I decided to post only the Cleric one.<br><br>In favor of your build, using Druid instead of Sorcerer will make you lose Haste because you can't merge any armor. Cleric can work it out <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  but you also won't get Epic Mage Armor, so take a good look at your ending buffs before changing to Druid.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;- The reason I take divine shield and divine might with my last two pre-epic feats is that I can't take them any earlier with my level split....they aren't available until my 3rd level of blackguard and I can't take blackguard until BAB reaches 6.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Right, sorry, that can only be done with Paladins or Clerics.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
