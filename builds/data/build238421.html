HS gains Eagle's Spelndor as spell too, and it stacks with Paladin's Eagle Splendor, no need to make a potion for it, you can cap it easily.<br><br>I would only drop 1 level of Paladin for CoT, to gain a feat, at level 19 Paladin you still have good amount of spellslots IMO.<br><br>I like it, it's very good, although I generally prefer more great stats than skill focuses.... but of course each to his own style, I'm sure some people would disagree with me.

60 Taunt ... there goes any chance casters had against you. However, I'd say either drop COT to 13, bump pally to 22 so that Holy Sword works better, or bump COT to 16 and Pally to 19 for the bonus feat. Your choice.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

Cheese version should be Paladin 29/CoT 10/HS 1 (HS at 40).  Can only double instead of triple stack CHA, but +1 bonus feat and immune to Greater Dispel.  Taking the HS at level 22 is a really fast way to GreatSmite X (level 36), but that's not the intent here.  Tymora has no paladin orders, but that's just nitpicking <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  Good job.<br>_________________<br>Vulcano's <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&amp;id=6522" target="_blank">Bard Studio</a> (in beta, 1.67).  *Updated*  Compose, play, and save your own bard music dynamically in game!
