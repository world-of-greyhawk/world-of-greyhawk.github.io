<b>Playable from level 1 - 40  ..PvM Build</b><br><br>This character is an update to my <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "123420", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Shadow of the Underdark builds</a>.  It is designed for low to mid magic settings where devastating critical is banned.  I dropped elf for human, eliminating the XP penalty, and hence I felt that the name no longer applied.  The original build had both a melee and ranged combat focus.  This build has focused in melee, picking up the knockdown feats and toughness, in exchange for ranged capability.  The build is still a competent archer, 41 AB with a bow (43 vs. FEs) but he doesn't have rapid shot anymore.  I felt that the build could use some extra damage so I went for the short sword instead of the mace for the better critical threat range.  If you prefer to use a mace, drop improved critical, drop improved knockdown down to level 9 and pick up blind-fight at 12.  The build has 7 favored enemies, enough to cover all the sneak attack immune racial groups and a 7D6 sneak attack, for the sneak vulnerable.  Unfortunately Pale Masters will prove a great problem for this build once the sneak immunity is implemented (too bad there is not pale master racial group, or half-dragon racial group for that matter).<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-Hide in Plain Sight.  Sure taking one level of shadowdancer seems cheap, but the 3.5 ranger does get HiPS as a feat.  Always a useful ability.   <br>-7D6 Sneak attack.  This is good extra damage, which this build desparately needs, against the sneak attack vulnerable.  With HiPs and Improved Knockdown, he doesn't have much trouble getting sneak attacks either. <br>-7 Favored Enemies and Bane of Enemies.  He gets 6+2D6 bonus damage and +2 to attack against these racial groups.  They should be chosen to eliminate those enemies who are immune to sneak attacks. <br>-Improved Evasion and good reflex saves against spells.<br>-Epic Dodge.  Unfortunately his AC isn't stellar, but if uses a shield and scroll of improved invisibility in a +5 environment he should be pretty hard to hit.<br>-Fair AB for a dual wielder.  A 42 is good for this mix of classes, but it could be better.<br>-Level 4 Ranger Spells.  They aren't great but aid, freedom of movement, camoflage, greater magic fang and polymorph self (turn into a troll to heal damage when you can't rest) can be useful.<br>-Use Magic Devices.  He can use scrolls and wands to suplement his abilities.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br><br>-Poor damage per hit.  An enemy with DR will pose a problem for this character.  Hopefully, he can find a weapon with bonus elemental damage (or a cleric or mage to cast darkfire or flame weapon) so that he can nickel and dime them to death.<br>-Low fortitude and will saves.<br><br><b>Blade of the Wilderness</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Human<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Any<br><br><i>Base Attribute</i><br>STR 10  <br>DEX 16 <br>CON 14  <br>WIS 14 <br>INT 14 <br>CHA 8<br><br><i>Leveling Guide</i><br>Levels 1-20 Ranger<br>Level 21-22 Rogue<br>Level 23 Shadowdancer <br>Level 24 Ranger<br>Levels 25-26 Rogue<br>Level 27 Ranger<br>Levels 28-29 Rogue<br>Level 30 Ranger<br>Levels 31-32 Rogue<br>Level 33 Ranger<br>Levels 34-35 Rogue<br>Level 36 Ranger<br>Levels 37-39 Rogue<br>Level 40 Ranger<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Ranger 26<br>Rogue 13<br>Shadowdancer 1<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>All 10 go to Dexterity<br><br><i>Animal Companion</i><br>Panther<br><br><i>Feats</i><br>Level 1: Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus (Short Sword), Favored Enemy (Undead)<br>Level 3: Knockdown<br>Level 5: Favored Enemy (Construct)<br>Level 6: Dodge<br>Level 9: Improved Critical (Short Sword)<br>Level 10: Favored Enemy (Outsider)<br>Level 12: Improved Knockdown<br>Level 15: Mobility, Favored Enemy (Dragon)<br>Level 18: Toughness<br>Level 20: Favored Enemy (Elemental)<br>Level 21: Epic Weapon Focus (Short Sword)<br>Level 24: Bane of Enemies<br>Level 27: Great Dexterity I<br>Level 30: Great Dexterity II, Epic Prowess<br>Level 33: Great Dexterity III<br>Level 35: Improved Evasion<br>Level 36: Great Dexterity IV, Favored Enemy (Abberations)<br>Level 38: Epic Dodge<br>Level 39: Defensive Roll, Epic Dodge<br>Level 40: Favored Enemy (Dwarves)<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 10<br>DEX 30<br>CON 14<br>WIS 14<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>Final Saves (Vs.

Just three things Mith:<br><br>1.  You have in both your exposition and in your AB calculations +2AB listed in regards to Bane.

You don't see too many dex builds that have over 400 hit points so I felt it was nice for a change. The extra HP also helps with Ice storms, IGMS, dragon breaths and horrid wiltings.  Expertise could be good for creating those rolling 20 battles, and good for RP purposes.  <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>3.  1 level of SD:  granted this gives you HiPS, but also adds some cheese.

Another alternative would be wizard, you still get to pump up spell craft but you also get 2 castings of true strike.  Dropping SD makes the sneak attack a bit less useful (this build probably can't knockdown a strength based fighter, but they usually don't have true sight).  It is less cheesy, but I don't consider it that bad for a ranger to take 1 level of SD since the 3.5 ranger gets HiPS and the class was a little torqued over in NWN.<br><br>Actually, Now that I think about it, the best SD substitution would be 1 level of druid.  You can max your spell craft, you get a +2 to AB while outside (which fits well with this build) and you get some useless spells.<br><br>Good suggestions. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 05/30/05 16:43</span></i></p>

You're right about the FE. Went back and checked and there is no +1hit. Perhaps I was thinking of an older and wiser Ranger Ruleset.<br><br>As for Shadowdancer, I think you make a good case for it given the 3.5Ruleset.  I guess you still need to weigh it against +8 magic Saves(Spellcraft), tiny Bardsong, and two extra feats.  It's a tough call.  HiPS will probably save your butt more at the end of the day.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I debated that one back and forth, and erred on the side of more ranger levels. I felt that the two FEs and the +1 to damage were a better than 1D6 of sneak attack and the extra rogue feat (I was thinking of using epic dodge as the extra feat, taking epic prowess as regular feat, so that I only lost 1 FE).  The sneak attacks average more damage than the Bane/FE bonus and against dragons and undead I found I wanted damage more than I did when I using Sneak Attack so I went Ranger heavy.  If there is interest I can post the Rogue heavy variant.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
