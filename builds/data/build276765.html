I've been watching the variety of characters flying off of everyones keyboards for a while now, and I was hoping that I could add an another few to the mix.<br><br>I'm not much on introductions and story lines so I hope some of you could add some suggestions for an interesting story regarding to this character.<br><br>The only other two that I found for this mix were both Elves - one by BRIAN FELLOW and the other by whirlin_merlin, both are very nice builds btw.  Nothing against Elves, but I wanted to bring in a Human element to the mix.  <br><br>This build still needs some tweaking, but I've played several incarnations on a variety of magic levels, all have functioned well as solo or as a part of a party.

Looks pretty good. Would like to see more WM levels, but if you do that you will have to drop a lot of the Rogue levels. Also, level 22 Rogue (39 character level) should have a bonus feat, right?

Why so many Rogue levels in an STR build?  Sure, IKD + sneaks is nice, but without more WM levels, it will be much harder to KD.  I'd suggest maybe a 13 Rogue/19 WM/8 CoT split maybe.  But of course, it is up to you. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

Neat build, and congrats on your first post (nicely done format-wise, now that title's fixed (we all love you, Finn)! (heh, and I love the concept ofdivine sneakers myself <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     <br><br>One of the nice thing about CoT's here, apart from sacred def. (saves), is helps offset some of the feats burned to get wm, but Mantis makes a great point: w. such an investment for a class (and being str-based), makes sense to go a lot more of it (prob is loss of sneak, and also some skills and saves, but hitting more often (AB) really, it's kinda esssential (yeah, I know, you've UMD, wh. you'll want to top out (works in mult. of 5), still ...  AB makes up for the sneak loss (more hits=more dam), and reason for more WM; another thing you're really going to want is Blind-fight (essential on non-arcanists me thinks, so .... <br><br>some thoughts, as I really like the idea of this build, so let's see if we can't get yer AB up and BF, w.o a lot of rogue/sneak loss too, 'kay? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      <br><br>I'd consider changing start stats to STR 17 (30), Dex 13 (you've stealth and ImpEvasion, and focus more on offense/AB instead ... <br><br>Rogue15/Cot6/WM19 - would lose (4d6) sneak (keep 8d6), and about -50 skill points, but gain +6 AB (2 from EWF/1 EP/and 3 from more WM, or ab't 45 naked, and making wm a very worthwhile invest.), and also a lot more HPs (about 440 w. ep toughness/wm 19 bonus feat, kinda imp. on a melee'r, 400 being sorta the min. on a melee'r, hence, really nice on a sneaker, yes? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">       Drop IKD for Blind-Fight and while saves wld suffer a bit (-2 all-saves, and adj for dex), you keep ImpEvasion (and w. more HPs, not worried ab't refl. so much <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">       also, since don't need ESF:disc (top out your disc via WW instead), adj. to pick up ie EpFort (for 28 fort overall, or +2 more than (in dev.crit, that's the one to worry about - for will save, you've UMD and remember: clarity potions are just about everyone's best friend <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">       ... <br><br>Alt., if really set on lots of rogue and sneak, and want even more saves, then go more CoT maybe - say, 14 Cot/19 rogue/7 wm as you have now (i.e., 10 cot pre-ep, pushing your 7 wm to epics, and wld. allow you to take ie both IKD and BF and also heavy armor prof. (always nice to have, and AS not so imp. then), 4 more Cot in eps to top disc (as above, rather than wasting a feat on it, about 347 skills, 400-ish hps, 29 fort, 22 will and 32 refl (IE)), and take WF/EP for +3 ab (so, naked ab 42, not bad on a rogue heavy build, w. 10d6 sneak (and can bring it back to 12d6 w. rogue impr.sneak attacks, or, alt. take esf:hide and esf:m/s, or as you want ... )<br><br>just some ideas for you - now, as to a concept, heh, kinda a 007/James Bond type, yes? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     <br><br>sneak/save the queen on! ~ Tyr<br><br>p.s.
