Yes I know, another RDD/Bard build.  But I think this one is a bit different.  I tried to make a version of the Troubadour Guardian, but with a better AB (by 10 I think), while sacrificing some AC (-3) and Bard spells (Cha to 30 instead of 36).  This char is not a melee master, but rather a spellsword type, which needs to use spells in order to be considered a melee presence.  With some buffing ahead of time and some nice spells in battle, along with a strong and long bard song and curse song, this contender should do well in a group.  And yes, there does need to be some alignment shifting, but only 4 times.  That is alot, I guess, but not as much as the Troubadour Guardian buld on the epic page requires...not offense, but  9 changes is a bit much.  I think that less than half is a lot, but much more acceptable.  If you start the char after level 7, which is possible in some mods, you should be ok for the 2 remaining changes.  Or after 9, which is kinda high, but not too bad for epic scale adventures.  And if you still think this is a bad idea, well, then you are probably right, but i still defend my right to post something this silly! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">   <br><br><b>PvM, playable 1 to 40</b><br><br>Human<br>Bard 32, RDD 4, Paladin 4<br><br>Alignment: Neutral Good, to Lawful Good, and back and forth a few times<br><br>STR 14 to 24<br>DEX 10<br>CON 14<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 16 to 30<br><br>first 6 points into Strength, last 4 into Charisma (levels 4,8,12,16,20,24 in Strength, levels 28,32,36,40 into Charisma)<br><br>1 )Bard1 Curse Song, Expertise<br>2 )Bard2<br>3 )Bard3 Power Attack *changing to Lawful good*<br>4 )Paladin<br>5 )Paladin<br>6 )Paladin Divine Might *changing to neutral good*<br>7 )Bard4<br>8 )Bard5 *changing to lawful good*<br>9 )Paladin Divine Shield *changing to neutral good*<br>10)Bard6<br>11)Bard7<br>12)Bard8 Still Spell<br>13)Bard9<br>14)Bard10<br>15)Bard11 Improved Critical: Scimitar<br>16)Bard12<br>17)Bard13<br>18)Bard14 Improved Expertise<br>19)Bard15<br>20)Bard16<br>21)RDD1 Great Charisma I<br>22)RDD2<br>23)RDD3<br>24)RDD4 Great Cha II<br>25)Bard17<br>26)Bard18<br>27)Bard19 Lasting Inspiration<br>28)Bard20<br>29)Bard21<br>30)Bard22 Great Cha III<br>31)Bard23 Great Cha IV<br>32)Bard24<br>33)Bard25 Great Cha V<br>34)Bard26 Great Cha VI<br>35)Bard27<br>36)Bard28 Great Cha VII<br>37)Bard29<br>38)Bard30 Great Cha IX<br>39)Bard31<br>40)Bard32 Great Cha X<br><br>Suggested Skills:<br>Concentration 43<br>Discipline 43<br>Spellcraft 43 (45 with int bonus)<br>Tumble 40<br>UMD 15 (25 with cha bonus)<br>Lore 8<br>This leaves you with quite a bit left over to put into whatever you like...I like heal, and maybe a few other skills.

It's good to see you stretching the limitations of the class system.  And you're correct in your assessment that 4 alignment changes are noteworthy, yet seem trivial next to the Troubador's 9 shifts(9???).  It seems you could do this by having only 2 alignment shifts.<br><br>A few things to consider:<br><br>1. Lasting Inspiration.  You'll need to swap this around with one of your Great Charismas.  Bard's cannot take it until 20 and beyond.<br><br>2. You have all your skills listed except the most important: Perform.  With 32 levels of Bard, it should be noted where you want the Bardsong to begin and the Curse Song to end.  Also, just how many points are left over?  This kind of build would highly benefit from a maxed Taunt.  A 30 Charisma is like getting ESF: Taunt for free.<br><br>3. RDD: I understand your thinking in taking 4RDD, and the 32 Bard, but consider this: 6 epic Bard levels net you 2 Great Charismas.  6 RDD levels would net you the same charisma increase, +4 more to Str, +2Con, more AC, and fire/paralysis immunity.  The only drawback really are the demon wings.<br><br>4. I would consider dropping the Expertise feats.  AC shouldn't be a problem, especially if you choose all 10RDD levels.  Instead, I would take Extra Turning and Blindfighting.  <br><br>5. You have a Great Charisma at Bard30.  Just move that to Bard29.<br><br>I think he has the potential to solo.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I think Griz is right<br>you aren't casting many spells at foes so you don't need high caster level for spell penetration<br>Also to make full use of level 32 Curse Song you'd need something like 110 (!) Perform<br>to fully use level 26 Curse Song you'd need 80 Perform which is achievable with items<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

I don't purport to be an expert on bard builds (I am struggling through one right now), but I thought you could take lasting inspiration as a 21st level character, not a 21st level bard (there is a difference).  The grimoire seems to support this:<br><br>Lasting Inspiration<br>Type of Feat: (Epic) General<br>Prerequisite: Perform 25, 21st level, Bard Song<br>Specifics: This feat allows the effects of bardic music to last ten times<br>longer.<br>Use: Automatic<br><br>I trust some of the builders on this site over the grimoire, but it is mostly right most of the time.<br><br>And it is important when you are trying to put together a fighter14/rdd10/bard16.  <br><br>Thanks.<br>_________________<br>We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender - Winston Churchill

Grimoire is wrong on that one.  You can take Lasting when you have 20 Bard levels.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
