I quite like this build. I would recommend on taking something like knockdown or lingering song since you already have 15 uses of bard song.

I wanted to stay away from Lingering Song... I think it's a waste unless you are going for Lasting Inspration. But I was thinking about trying to work in Knockdown and IKD. But that brings me to what feats should I drop. Imp. Crit isn't necessary... I mean I like it because your Divine Damage gets double also but if I depend on Crits with this build... that would just be stupid.<br><br>Extra Music is nice for those 24 hour rest servers, like the one I built this one on... but I probably wouldn't need the extra songs if I could knock my opponents over. But, I'd like to take IKD early in my build, pre-epic, so I'll have to figure that in.<br><br>Thanks for the advice Jesh... <br><br>I've also had some other thoughts... Like taking Bard on my last level to be able to boost all my stats then. So, back to the drawing board.

just an idea to improve playability a little bit.  switch where you take EWF and Armor Skin.  that will give you the extra +2 to AB almost 20 levels sooner.  the AC is probably not too bad, since cleric spells can help with that.  just really my preference.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>Et Earello Endorenna utulien.<br>Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta.

Is Armor Skin a CoT/ Fighter bonus feat? Yet another thing I'll have to check... if it is then it WILL play a WHOLE lot better... and you are right... this build can afford to save an AC feat for later... since it can get to around 50 without trying, from Divine SHeild and the Cleric spells.<br><br>I've been playing with the idea of just dropping CoT 9/ 10 and taking 2 more Cleric levels... I'd have level 9 spells plus a few more spells in other levels but would sacrifice AB, Saving Throws and a feat (and this build is very light on the feat).

I quite like this build...I am a fan of multiple casting schools.<br><br>However, what I do not like is the fact that I only have a total of 30 slots to put spells in---at epic levels, this is not nearly enough, particularly for a build of this type.

Man... I feel you... I remember trying to squeeze all my spells and skills into those dumb slots with my Cleric/ Druid build (imagine 46 wisdom after bonuses and level 9 spells in both classes) and the buffing... it took me longer to buff then to sleep.<br><br>But one reason I like this biuld is that it's not as reliant on spells as some dual casting builds and only uses about 22 slots regularly.<br><br>Thanks for the comments... and I like this build... especially since I took on 2 god-like Demiliches and lived to tell the tale... that Divine damage is a lot better than most people give it credit for.

Well... that leaves a lot of possiblities... maybe I tried it as a druid... my favorite class... I think I was going to take it as the lvl 24 (final Druid of that build... for the 12 Wisdom of course) and couldn't. Anyway thanks for the info... I also got a mesage that I should just look at the "Epic {put class here}" feat I get and it tells me if I can get what or not.
