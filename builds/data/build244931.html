Medieval Scout – <br>Rogue(17), Paladin(17), Champion of Torm(6)<br><br>By Deborah Tyr<br><br>Concept: Ever wondered, before the knights went out to fight a war, who went out before hand? To scout the lay of the lands and gather information, and/or to attend to negotiations, and then report back to the King and/or Queen to ultimately conduct the intelligence-gathering process and, as such, direct the conduct of strategic military and diplomatic affairs? Why, the medieval Scout of course. <br><br>The Medieval Scout is a Dex-Based Paladin, with good spell access, combat (melee), and stealth; inspired by Finneous, this character is designed for PvM/Single-Player (Level 1-40), but should also be welcome in PvP.<br><br><br>Medieval Scout – <br>Rogue(17), Paladin(17), Champion of Torm(6)<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Lawful Good<br>Hitpoints: 412<br><br><br>FINAL STATS:<br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 17 (30)<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 10<br>CHA: 9<br><br><br>Saving Throws:<br>Fort:  27 (29 Protection) +3 Divine Wrath<br>Will:   23 (25 Protection) +3 Divine Wrath<br>Reflex: 33 (35 Protection) +3 Divine Wrath<br><br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4, Traps: +4, <br>Immunities: Fear, Disease, Death Magic (Death Ward)<br><br>NOTE (1): Does not include scroll buffs available to this character via UMD;<br>Note  (2): Stealth Skills Maximized, has Crippling Strike &amp; Epic Dodge feats.<br><br><br><br>Combat Vitals:<br><br>BAB: 27, <br>AB: +41 (No Buffs) / AB +48 [UMD/Cat’s &amp; (Greater Magic Weapon –OR- Holy Sword) Only]<br>+1 Bless<br>+5 Divine Favor<br>+1 Prayer<br>+1 Aid<br>+1 Deafening Clang<br>--<br>AB +57 (Self-Buffs Only, No Equipment)<br>--<br>+3 Divine Wrath (Duration: 3-4 Rounds, with Eagle’s &amp; Aura of Glory Only)<br>--<br>+ 3-4 Smite AB Bonus (with Eagle’s &amp; Aura of Glory Only, No equipment)<br><br>AB Capped: <br>UMD/True Strike (+20 AB) and Dex-boost (+6 AB), AB +67 <br><br>*Calculation does not factor in KD considerations. <br><br><br>Damage:<br>Mundane Short Sword, 1d6 +*STR.

Note 2 - Elf as a valid alternate:<br>As an alternative, although I prefer the HPs (thus human), might consider the elf class. They get a +2 Dex Bonus (but at a cost of -2 Con); as such, elf would net you +1 AB and +1 AC over the above, but HPs would fall to 372, and Fort to 26 (unbuffed). This, in turn, would impact final skills as follows (again, all other things remaining exactly the same):<br><br>Skills if an Elf (188):<br>Heal 3(5), Hide 39(50), Move Silently 39(50), Open Lock 1(12), Spellcraft 20(20), Tumble 35(46), UMD 31(30)<br><br>While I prefer the HPs, since this build does have ED and crippling strike, elf is a valid alternative to human. To my knowledge, an elf would also not suffer any XP penalty on this build, due to their affinities and the split-balance either. So, for all you elf fans out there who just know how good scouts does an elf make, this should come as welcome news <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/24/06 07:58</span></i></p>

LOL, it aint that hard the AB.. but a guide could be of use, knowledge doesn't comes from the sky.<br><br>Even so, Grim is right, if you test the build the Character Sheet won't show +84 AB, as well as DEX won't give damage nor Weapon Finesse will work with a longsword, when you test it you can see the "Why the hell isn't this stuff working? it should have so blasting boosted stats!!!"<br><br>I do like the build, the concept is ok and it's power is decent I think... but I found some other error there: Tumble. Tumble gives 1 AC for every 5 base levels, DEX modifier does not affect it, it will only affect the Tumble checks, so you should take 40 Tumble instead of 35, by all means.<br><br>As for me, I'd take more Paladin pre-epic to get more BAB, I say you should take no more than 8 Rogue pre-epic.

Hey, everyone: Av, Grizz, you're great knights! Maiden rescued <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      <br><br>Thanks so much for the chart, Grizz; that is just so helpful. It's a vast sky out there, Thax, it really is, for me at least at this junction, still trying to figure all of this stuff out, as to what counts and what doesn't - getting there, almost, and now with that chart - thank you so much. It's a good class-lesson <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      Short, sweet, and worth every penny <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      (seriously, thanks!). Come back to that in a second.<br><br>As to damage, could we please change that to a short swort, 1d6, +*Str mod. (which would be +2 Bull's in the list); that's a pure error on my part, for which I do apologize, due to late night post. (I'm in the midst of writing a medieval history piece and well, while it's great stuff for character concepts, these late nights are killing me (sorry about that) <br><br>Now, back to that wonderful chart (and it is!) - <br>I agree that we should post Grizz' chart on a sticky or something; it's short, sweet, and very helpful (trying to hunt all this stuff down, I tells ya; I *do* test my builds but didn't take this one PvP, so wasn't sure how TS works, as AB 41 unbuffed even with a lower BAB worked fine in PvM/mod. Should be okay for PvP, but maybe with a bit more tweaking, could get it up just a bit more (I'm worried about XP penalties, etc., and that's why I settled on the split I did; but it may be possible, with a bit more fine-tuning, you know I'll have a look (thanks thax, and nice to see ya); then there's True Strike....<br><br>I know that TS is great for rougues, etc., and that they generally can't live without it in PvP, so added it on; wasn't sure about how the TS &amp; cap thing works (obviously). You folks have and continue to inspire me to look into non-obvious combos, and the like, and that's wonderful). And Grim, I'd "beg" you to do it edit for me just this once; I'm gonna look into some tweaking, to see about the BAB thing as per thax (yeah, he's okay, but higher base to start, if possible, always good) . . . may take a day or so, so....pretty please? If there are any changes, I'll pm you everything when I'm satisfied (um, what if I say pretty please and add a horde of dragon's gold on top?  just this once).<br><br>Apologies and thank yous to everyone (&amp; Thax, as always, I appreciate your challenges! - back soon <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/24/06 22:47</span></i></p>

Don't worry. I have made the initial edits, just pm me if you have more of them. No need to apologize, I choose to believe you have tested it. We all make mistakes. No need for bribes, but I shalll graciously accept. I forgot to add one thing in my rampage up there: Very good build, nice final damage for a dexer.<br><br>AB. Grizz has a good one. Basically it's like this. Ab with mundane chosen weapon. Add stat buffs(max +6 more AB). On top of that all you'll ever get is 20 more, counting song, weapon enhancements and all. Bane of enemies can breach it. The Druid +2 in natural surroundings breach it. Smite breach it. Then there is AC lowering capacities to help. Enhancement bonuses from two different sources do not stack.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/24/06 13:39:36 (GMT) -- avado<br><br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">     now im moderator enemy number 1  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">      I was just trying to be my knightly self <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">  <br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Rather our friend.

I figured I'd be a rebel and actually comment on the build (as opposed to speculating on the mysteries of the AB cap <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> ).<br><br>At first I was wondering how a paladin/COT could possibly get by with a charisma of 9, considering that one their most popular abilities (Divine Grace) would be reduced to nothingness.<br><br>However I can see that this build can get by without it (quite easily too), with a nice little mixture of UMD and actually being able to cast spells <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> .<br><br>Just a thought though, did you consider replacing 4 levels of paladin with COT? <br><br>That would give you an additional +2 to saves (sacred defense), Divine Wrath would give +5 bonuses instead (although I'm not sure how it would work, considering it will only last for -1 round), and you'll get 2 bonus feats.<br><br>Regardless of what you do, this is still a good build (I like that it has so many hitpoints for a dexer, and it's sneak attacks <i>will</i> hurt <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> )

The problem with going for less Pally is that she loses castings from the good Pally spellbook, Holysword among other things and the duration will suffer.

Thanks much for your compliments on this build, everyone; his charm "snuck up" on me, too - <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">           Glad you like him; I see him as a medieval "007 - James Bond" - As to the AB &amp; damage stuff, sorry once again about the late night error. Basically, it's like this: <br><br>AB +41 unbuffed (+42 if an elf), add True Strike (+20 weaponry cap), then boost Dex for another +6, for a total AB +67 (+68 if an elf). Can breach this cap with smite, ie., +3-4 from cha, with Eagle's and Aura buffs; if raised +12 (ie., capped), you get a final smite bonus of a whopping +5 AB for his smite strike <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">            <br><br>His real "power" comes from his mix of UMD/spells, &amp; he can deal some pretty nice damage (sneak and combat), with decent HPs, too, (as Meph, Finn and Grim point out -thanks &amp; well put <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">       More COT would mean slightly better saves, but not at the cost of high level spells for, since access to them (and most of their duration) depends on pally level, which can't be bought. Anyway, he's some nice protection spells, and then there's UMD. <br><br>choices, choices ... I kinda like that holy sword of his though (and Grim, thought that you liked Pally's with holy swords, too? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  His real "weakness" if you can call it that, is in the skills department: as a rougue, he's thin; while he has what he needs, would've been nice to get some trap skills in there for instance, but not a necessity or problem. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">         <br><br>Still looking into mini-tweaks, but I dunno. To avoid XP penalties would mean either giving up pally spell access or extra sneak, neither of which I'm wanting to do, as would detract from the overall build; then, if we stop and think about it, with unbuffed AB 41 (42 if elf), with all that other stuff, it's kinda neat for a dexer. Plus, he's got KD, his spells/UMD buffs, and of course access to UMD/True Strike...<br><br>Thanks again, everyone (and once again to Grizz, for his very useful chart and to Grim, for further info (hmmm, Sherlock &amp; Watson, in the mysteries of Bioware's cap, which mystery is solved <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">       ~ Tyr<br><br>P.S. To Thax, while I'm still looking into it, must admit it's looking more and more like this build is the one - you remember what happened last time I tried to "sell" XP penalties on a build? - <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">            <br><br>pss. to Meph &amp; Finn: yep, we cuts up that pally pretty darn good among the three of us, didn't we . . . OOPS. Is that the Rogue coming out? Nah, this one's Lawful Good :lol" <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">            <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/26/06 05:18</span></i></p>

Dang, lol, I had a TyrPaladin flashback for a second <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif"> <br><br>I like the idea behind the build.  I usually don't like to see rogue and paladin in the same builds (I have never seen a Lawful Good rogue), but I can see why in NWN you would want to do it. Nice extra damage and feats for a dex based holy warrior type in the rogue class.  I do agree that that you should keep the current levels of paladin, as you really need that holy sword spell.  Again, nice build idea.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

Like the build...Intresting concept, I think...One thing, about the AB Cap...I believe the Character Sheet WILL actually show you as having a +84 AB (It has in my experience, anyway), but if you fight a monster/PC/whatever, the Combat Log should show your real AB.

For the RP Aspect...Personally, I don't like it myself, BUT, I can see how you could RP it. Think of it as a Paladin that would do anything (Sneak Attack an opponent, set traps, etc.) to see that justice prevailed.

As to revision: what we've done, is bump COT up pre-epic, while maintaining split b/w rogue and pally (for better BAB/AB, 1 extra fort save, and no xp penalties for our elf friends, I think). This opened up 1 extra feat pre-epic, ie toughness; lost a feat in epic, i.e., Armor Skin (hence, AC loss) - gets 1 AC back though by maxing Tumble, plus a few other minor skill tweaks, for more UMD - still don't get any trap skills though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>Then, as Dark points out, not exactly the kinda character you take out crypt robbing (not only can't he disarm the traps, but he won't - and he'll likely arrest ya for even asking <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">     ). Yeah, LG: probably not yer first choice as party's rogue, but as a dex/stealth holy ftr, why not?! (and ya know he won't take yer wallet <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   Glad to hear you like the concept, too (I know, not everyone will, seems at first glance kinda odd ....<br><br>&amp; Av - well put! &amp; Thanks, yeah: James Bond type; FBI or US Navy Seal/Green Beret Special Ops, MI5, or your very own fabled RCMP special forces (without that neat red uniform <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>OH, btw: not exactly sure about this T-Pal guy, but eh hem, ....

sorry, needs to make a correction re: turn undead (HD)on the build as revised - should read 14+2d6 ; with pally SR being 17+1d20 (arrrr! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    ) if um, um, we could just edit that? <br><br>OK, if everyone's happy with this one as revised, giving it the good guild once more look over (which no one can like this guild do <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    --- if we could post the revised version up top (unless you want me to repost; thinking though, with some of my past builds being marked final, then final v.2 etc. in past, can get kinda confusing, (not to mention taking up space on pulse cap).<br><br>Lemme know what the preferred protocols are, and welcome of course everyone's continuing comments <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>(thanks again, everyone)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/26/06 19:29</span></i></p>

Thanks, Finn. (t'was a D&amp;D test thing, an RP thing: me bad <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">      Nor can I by any means take full credit on the sneak-pally concept as it's inspired by Finn (&amp; James Bond, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   - all kiddin' aside, Finn's got a gnomish sneaker-smiter, which is neat. He focused on smite, whereas this one's spell stuff, and, great news, there's 1 more sneaker-pally up, by Meph, focussing on divine stuff (and neat, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   As such, 3 nice guy/James Bond-types or what have you to chose from which I just think is neat (&amp; thanks for the edits; to all who helped out/commented on this build, merci &amp; thank you!, and will repost this character, as we've revised him soon. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/26/06 23:37</span></i></p>
