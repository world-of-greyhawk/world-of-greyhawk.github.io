I was looking at the build for Cinnabar Din's Favoured of Moradin here:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "200316", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>In this thread a saving throw cap is talked about (at +20).  My question is what counts towards this cap?<br><br>I am doubting that the regular feats do:<br>Iron Will/Lightening Reflexes/Great Fortitude<br>Epic Will/Reflexes/Fortitude<br><br>What about the following?<br>Luck of Hero's<br>Divine Grace<br>Sacred Defense<br>Dark Blessing<br>Spellcraft<br>Hardiness vs Spells/Illusions<br><br>Example:<br>Dwarven Paladin 10 Champion of Torm 30 with 24 Charisma.<br><br>Divine Grace +7<br>Sacred Defense +15<br>Hardiness vs Spells + 2<br><br>You might think that this would give you +22 to your saves and +24 vs spells.  Is this the case?  Or would it be maxed at +20?<br><br>Thanks.

First off I'd do a search for "saves" because I did a while back and know I read something about the cap.<br><br>If it's like the +12 ability or +20 AB cap, your feats usually do not count (Great Fort, Divine Grace, etc.).  The cap is usually to magically increased things, like spells or items.<br><br>Otherwise you'll have to wait for an expert.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

There is a cap on saves like everything else, but I've never seen anything written about it.<br><br>You should look at Evo_Dragon's Max Save (P7 BG3 CoT30,  build.   <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "132030", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Max Possible Saves Build / Paladin7/Blackguard3/Cot30</a><br>It's a cheap trick through alignment shifting and so forth, but that has the highest saves on record I believe.<br><br>....   ....   ....   ....   .... ....<br>griphook ..Fixed Broken link<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 07/23/05 18:38</span></i></p>
