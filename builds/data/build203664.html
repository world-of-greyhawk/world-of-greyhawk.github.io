Grizzled_dwarflord's Grimblade inspired this build. It's very similar, but a DEX-based version. Who knows, perhaps they're members of the same Assassin's Guild... Got a 'job' that needs doing?

I understand the necessity sometimes (actually quite often) for not dual wielding until you have reached a decent level. I implied that there is a benefit to AB, but this only over dual wielding without the TWF feat.  If you are going to use sword&amp;board then weapon focus is the way to go; you are correct.

You know, I've always wondered why people are so reticent to dual wield early if they can get the feats that soon.  In most cases, the extra attack per round more than outweighs the -2 penalty.  For example, I did out the math for my Arcane Blade of Torm a while back.  That build gets Ambidexterity and TWF at level one.  It has an AB of 3 at level 1 when single wielding, and 1/1 when dual wielding.  Here is a chart of the chance to hit <b>at least</b> once per round for all enemy ACs 10 and up.  SW is for single wielding, DW for double wielding.  I've also listed the chance for hitting twice per round for dual wielding in parentheses next to the other percentage (note that additional number is itself included in the total chance to hit at least once):<br><br><!-- BBNwscript Start --><div align="center"><form>NWScript:<br><textarea class="codequote" cols="40" rows="12" readonly="readonly" wrap="off">AC          SW          DW 10          70%         84% (36%) 11          65%         79.75% (30.25%) 12          60%         75% (25%) 13          55%         69.75% (20.25%) 14          50%         64% (16%) 15          45%         57.75% (12.25%) 16          40%         51% (9%) 17          35%         43.75% (6.25%) 18          30%         36% (4%) 19          25%         27.75% (2.25%) 20          20%         19% (1%) 21          15%         9.75% (0.25%) 22          10%         9.75% (0.25%) 23+          5%         9.75% (0.25%)</textarea></form><br><a href="viewcodepost.html?post=1472063" target="code">View Post/Code in separate window</a></div><br><!-- BBNwscript End --><br><br>So, only for some of the very high ACs (20-22) will a single wielder hit more often, and even then, only at 21 was the single wielder's benefit at all significant.  Plus, a 1st level character is unlikely to face enemies with ACs that high anyway; the likelier ACs (from 10-18 or so probably) give the advantage to the dual wielder.  And of course, only the dual wielder has the chance for two hits in one round.<br><br>Now, obviously these exact numbers are specific to a different build that this one, but the general tendency is the same.  As such, I wouldn't really think it that unreasonable to dual wield earlier on.  With this build, you could certainly start by level 2-3 (you'd could have weapon finesse, weapon focus, ambi, and TWF by then) and find yourself hitting more often than if you stayed with a single weapon.<br><br>Anyway, that's my take on it.  I love the build though, along with the other members of the Dwarven Assassins Guild I've seen lately, <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">     .  I'll have to come up with my own entry for the guild when I get home and back to my NWN computer next week.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 07/14/05 00:54</span></i></p>

Steve, thanks for the chart. It's been my experience that at lower levels (first 4 or 5) I haven't found dual-wielding to be in my characters' best interests, despite the numbers. It seems to me (and, admittedly, this may be only perception and not really the case) that I miss somewhat more often when dual wielding at level 1, 2, and 3 at least, and also I tend to want the extra AC provided by a shield for the first handful of levels as well.<br><br>Of course, like everything else, I guess that's environment-dependant.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

That's why it looks worse.  But, you're getting 2 attacks per round instead of just one, so in terms of hits/damage per round, which is all that matters, you're doing better.  That's the deceptive part of what you're seeing.  You look at the combat log and see you're missing half your hits, but don't notice you're hitting once every round, far better than if you only had one attack per round.  My ABoT was really plowing through enemies at low levels with that two-bladed sword because of it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .<br><br>But as for the AC, yes, if you're in an AC over AB environment, then yes, it still pays off to sword/board it regardless of the extra hit per round.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 07/14/05 03:04</span></i></p>

Steve, there are three kind of Lies in this world:  Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics.<br><br>What you overlooked in your dazzling display of quantum weapon mechanics is that it is still a game of dice and chance, especially at early levels, and statistics be damned, but I roll bad nearly 95% of the time.  If the only roll where I can miss or fail is a 1, then you can bank that I'll roll a 1.  <br><br>Nevertheless, you raise a good point, and I'll have the Gnomes look into it.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
