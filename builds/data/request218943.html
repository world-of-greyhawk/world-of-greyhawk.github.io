Scythe would get the better crits but I wouldn't pick either for PvP because of the damage types bug. Pick a heavy flail for a two-hander <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

What's supposed to happen is all the damage is supposed to be considered as piercing (since you deal both types of damage).

IMO, it's a really STUPID bug which ought to have been fixed by now <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><br>_________________<br>.:\_/:. Only those who have known darkness in<br>(OvO) their hearts will see the shadows in life...<br>(|__|)<br>..".."..

It's more than just a bug.  Anybody taking a weapon with 2 damage types is penalized beyond belief when, instead, they should be rewarded for taking the road not taken.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
