Well, the possibility of Monk cheese over Paladin cheese should be noted here... These builds are nice with Monk AC because you get both AB &amp; AC from Wisdom. You'd also get +4 additional AC from Tumble. Saves take a hit, of course.<br><br>One thing I'd definitely change is drop two Great WIS for Epic Prowess and Armor Skin. You gain +2 AC for no loss (other than the -1 on spell DCs but you never stated he's casting spells offensively anyway). If you're going Monk, you gain +1 AC by doing this (+2 Armor Skin -1 loss of WIS) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>As for the numbers, use <b>math</b> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  It's simple enough to check your HP, AB, AC, saves et cetera by simply adding up (and perhaps having a look at some tables).<br><br>I'd drop BAB to 15 in order to abuse your un-dispellable Divine Power.<br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm

Monk cheese would be cool, and if you change to melee you could drop Zen archery and take Blind-Fight... too bad he doesn't has the amount of feats or stats to take Improved Two Weapon Fighting....<br><br>Anyway, there's nothing particularly wrong with using ranged, it's ok, since your HP/AC is not so incredibly high, but the monk would still give you AC over a full plate... not sure how you see it, but I would take Called Shot or Rapid Fire instead of Toughness (or even both instead of something else).<br><br>It's nice, but you <b>have</b> more buffs you know, Divine Favor is very strong, and that's just to start, be aware of all your buffs and you'll see how strong he can get.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/21/06 04:38</span></i></p>

Though people have definately commented on my poor choice of Cleric domains <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif"> , I would <b>definately</b> take Trickery as a domain on this build...50% concealment is ALWAYS useful as it means u get hit 25-50% less of the time!!!<br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!

i say stay with a ranged weapon and keep cha at 14 , put the rest into wis and pick up esf evoc. as a weapon i d eiter use bow (elf , good arrows /bows r available in most mods) or a sling as halfling (for +2 more ab due to size and throwing weapon).<br>rapid shot is a great feat ,especially if used with divine power and haste. you get 4 atacks /rnd with (full ab -2).

I didn't notice he had 8 DEX..... too bad, rapid shot is definitely good.<br><br>But.... being human longbow doesn't includes composite longbows does it? you would need exotic proficiency or be an elf for it, too bad, no mighty, but it's acceptable, having that divine damage.<br><br>Having high CHA should be quite important, considering divine wrath, divine shield and divine wrath work with CHA, as well as bonus to saves, and that's only if I didn't missed anything else. Lower CHA is a bad idea, keep it high and buff it.
