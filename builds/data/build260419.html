Description: This build is a bit of a team build, It focuses on the use of stunning fist, and unarmed disarm, which steals the weapon. This build was made up spontaneously, so it lacks alot of planning... When using abilities, if you're hastede with flurry, you've got three full ab bonus attacks in your first flurry, so do three attacks then if you can<br><br>Race: Elf<br>Alignment: Any Lawful<br>Works in most team based attacks<br>Playable 3-40<br><br><br>Starting Stats:<br>Str - 8<br>Dex - 17<br>Con - 12<br>Int - 14<br>Wis - 16<br>Cha - 8<br><br>Ending Stats:<br>Str - 8<br>Dex - 26<br>Con - 12<br>Int - 14<br>Wis - 22<br>Cha - 8<br><br><br><br>1 Monk 1 - Toughness<br>2 Monk 2<br>3 Monk 3 - Weapon Finesse<br>4 Monk 4 - DEX +1<br>5 Monk 5<br>6 Monk 6 - Weapon Focus: Unarmed Strike<br>7 Monk 7<br>8 Monk 8 - WIS +1<br>9 Monk 9 - Extra Stunning Fist<br>10 Monk 10<br>11 Monk 11<br>12 Monk 12 - WIS +1, Improved Critical<br>13 Monk 13<br>14 Monk 14<br>15 Monk 15 - Expertise<br>16 Monk 16 - WIS +1<br>17 Fighter 1 - Disarm<br>18 Fighter 2 - Improved Disarm, Imrpoved Expertise<br>19 Fighter 3<br>20 Fighter 4 - DEX +1, Weapon specialisation<br>21 Fighter 5 - Epic Weapon Focus<br>22 Fighter 6 - Epic Weapon Specialisation<br>23 Fighter 7<br>24 Fighter 8 - WIS +1, Great Dex, Improved Stunning Fist<br>25 Fighter 9<br>26 Fighter 10 - Improved Stunning Fist II<br>27 Fighter 11 - Improved Stunning Fist III<br>28 Fighter 12 - DEX +1, Improved Stunning Fist IV<br>29 Fighter 13<br>30 Fighter 14 - Improved Stunning Fist V &amp; VI<br>31 Fighter 15<br>32 Fighter 16 - DEX +1 Improved Stunning Fist VII <br>33 Fighter 17 - Improved Stunning Fist VIII<br>34 Fighter 18 - Improved Stunning Fist IX<br>35 Fighter 19<br>36 Fighter 20 - WIS +1, Great Dex II, Armor Skin/Prowess<br>37 Monk 17<br>38 Monk 18<br>39 Monk 19 - Great Dex III<br>40 Monk 20 - WIS +1<br><br>Skills<br>Hide, MS, Tumble, Heal<br><br>Naked HP: 440<br>+12 CON HP: 680<br><br>Naked AB: +37/+34/+31/+28/+25/+22<br>+12 DEX AB: +43/+40/+37/+34/+31/+28<br>Flurry haste +12 DEX AB: +41/+41/+41/+38/+35/+32/+29/+26<br><br>Naked AC: 35<br>+12 DEX and WIS AC: 47<br><br>Naked Stunning DC: 54<br>+12 WIS Stunning DC: 60<br><br>Saves<br>Fort: 25<br>Reflex: 28<br>Will: 27<br><br>Improvements: If you play on a server with good potions, get discipline instead of heal. If the server is riddled with knockdowns, and you need heal, get rid of listen, and hang around people who can see for you. Also, if it's allowed, you could take a shadowdancer level instead of a fighter. If you do that, I suggest you take all your monk levels first, and then add one shadow dancer at 21, and one at 40, that way you have mind immunity earlier. Also, you could place your final four monk levels at different points, to give you your tumble ac... I suggest 22 27 and 32, leaving the last at 40. You may also wish to lose a few of those fighter levels to gain more stunning fists. At the cost of DC. You should also consider more dexterity... to get your ab up and land more stunning fists, and you should think about epic skill focus in hide and move silently.<br>That's all I can think of, feel free to comment

Your Stunning Fist DC is very high, but your AB is pretty low.  Stuns that don't hit don't count, and nobody's gonna get disarmed with rolls like those.  I'd drop some Wis and Improved Stunning Fist feats for more Dex to get that AB up...not many people are going to make even a DC 46-48 fort save if it's not a spell (no SC bonus).<br><br>I also think the SD levels you suggested would be an excellent choice for this build.  If it's as much of a team player as you intend, you're going to be spending most of your time hidden, then jumping out long enough to spring three SFs, Disarms, or IKDs, then running away before you get clobbered.  HiPS makes that a lot easier.

You could sqeeze some more AB out of this by taking more Fighter levels pre-epic to raise your BAB. You could get up to three, by my calculations without taking Fighter first which would cost skill points. Of course doing this will mean you have to wait longer for Monk abilities.

the order of levels you take depends alot on the level that you start on in the server, because it's unarmed, You kinda want to get up to level 16 monk quickly, to make use of that 1d20 damage, and the extra stun attacks...<br><br>As for the stun dc, yeah, it could go lower, as could the wisdom, but when I was making this build I got to 58 dc and go "Ooh, a round number up ahead..."<br><br>If you wanted more ab/ac, you could reduce wis by two and add those to dex, and then take out four improved stunning fists, giving you an extra 4 dex with those, this brings your dc to another even nicer looking number of 50. But as you might notice, this build has alot of variation that can be added, such is the case with my builds...<br><br>I didn't add SD in the main build because it is easier to edit a build when it's simple like it is now, you should be able to see little things that can be edited, spots that you can change stuff. Other reason is I personally hate the HiPS exploit, and so I don't build with SD in mind...
