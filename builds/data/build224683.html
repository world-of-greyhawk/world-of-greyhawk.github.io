Hi everyone,<br><br>It's been a while since I've had an opportunity to reply to my most favorite build I've submitted here so I decided to repost it on a new thread.  If the moderator is kind enough to read this, I'd appreciate it if you'd delete the old <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "175457", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Epitome of Defence</a> and place this one in its stead.<br><br>I reposted for a couple of reasons.  One, I wanted everyone to see the updated build using the wonderful Character Build Creator I downloaded from Neverwinter Vault.  Second, there was a heated debate about this build's prowess.  I was new to the boards and I was afraid to admit there were builds better than mine.  So, I got defensive.  I wanted a new thread without all of the arguing.<br><br>Now, I present to you:<br><br>The Epitome of Defense<br>Lawful Neutral Shield Dwarf<br><b>playable 1 - 40 PvM/PvP-lite</b><br><br>STR: 14<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 19 (30)<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 6<br><br>01: Fighter(1): Bullheaded, Expertise<br>02: Monk(1): M: (Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist)<br>03: Fighter(2): Toughness, Improved Expertise<br>04: Fighter(3): CON+1, (CON=20)<br>05: Fighter(4): Dodge<br>06: Fighter(5): Iron Will<br>07: Fighter(6): Blind Fight<br>08: Monk(2): CON+1, M: (Deflect Arrows), (CON=21)<br>09: Dwarven Defender(1): Lightning Reflexes, DD: (Defensive Stance)<br>10: Dwarven Defender(2): DD: (Defensive Awareness I)<br>11: Dwarven Defender(3)<br>12: Dwarven Defender(4): CON+1, Great Fortitude, (CON=22)<br>13: Dwarven Defender(5)<br>14: Dwarven Defender(6)<br>15: Dwarven Defender(7): Power Attack<br>16: Dwarven Defender(8): CON+1, (CON=23)<br>17: Dwarven Defender(9)<br>18: Dwarven Defender(10): Skill Focus: Discipline<br>19: Fighter(7)<br>20: Fighter(8): CON+1, Improved Power Attack, (CON=24)<br>21: Dwarven Defender(11): Epic Damage Reduction I<br>22: Dwarven Defender(12)<br>23: Dwarven Defender(13)<br>24: Dwarven Defender(14): CON+1, Epic Damage Reduction II, Epic Damage Reduction III, (CON=25)<br>25: Dwarven Defender(15)<br>26: Dwarven Defender(16)<br>27: Dwarven Defender(17): Epic Will<br>28: Dwarven Defender(18): CON+1, Perfect Health, (CON=26)<br>29: Dwarven Defender(19)<br>30: Dwarven Defender(20): Epic Reflexes<br>31: Dwarven Defender(21)<br>32: Dwarven Defender(22): CON+1, Armor Skin, (CON=27)<br>33: Dwarven Defender(23): Epic Fortitude<br>34: Dwarven Defender(24)<br>35: Dwarven Defender(25)<br>36: Dwarven Defender(26): CON+1, Epic Skill Focus: Discipline, Epic Toughness I, (CON=28)<br>37: Dwarven Defender(27)<br>38: Dwarven Defender(28)<br>39: Dwarven Defender(29): Great Constitution I, (CON=29)<br>40: Dwarven Defender(30): CON+1, Epic Toughness II, (CON=30)<br><br>Concentration 43(53)<br>Discipline 43(58)<br>Listen 9(8)<br>Spellcraft 21(23)<br>Spot 9(8)<br>Tumble 20(21)<br><br>Hitpoints: 936<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 42/28/25<br>BAB: 29<br>AB (max, naked): 31 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 17/28<br><br>There he is.  My most favorite build of all.  Now, for more emulation use the Eberk picture from the Neverwinter Vault and give him a warhammer and you'll pretty much be playing the same character I play.<br><br>Against meleers:  You're the tank so you shouldn't struggle much against meleers.  With DR 30/- you'll do pretty well in the damage war.  Your +42 fortitude save can help you significantly against Devastating Critical and +58 to your Discipline should ensure you stay on your feet.  The key to a melee fight is to watch the enemy's attack bonus.  Do the math and figure out how much AC you need.  You have several options with Defensive Stance, Expertise, and Improved Expertise.  Use the one that forces him to roll a 20 to hit you.  The theory is this:  if his focused ability is to attack and you, and you negate that with high armor class and DR, then you should win considering your primary ability, defense, is still in effect.<br><br>Against clerics:  Most clerics I've fought against are buff/meleers.  This can pose a problem because clerics can get their AB through the roof.  Throw on Improved Expertise and try to weather the storm.  With 936 hp and DR 30/- you should be able to last.  As their buffs fail them, keep a close eye on their AB.  As it drops, use just enough defense to keep their AB at a required 20 attack roll.  Once all of their offensive buffs are gone, you should be able to throw on Defensive Stance or Improved Power Attack and steam roll over them.<br><br>Against casters/mages:  This is the toughest of them all.  In the rock/paper/scissors game of D&amp;D, everything says they should destroy a melee build.  Most counter with Knockdown/Improved Knockdown.  The strategy here is to use all of the offense you can.  Mose mages will have some sort of elemental shield or other damaging defensive shield.  Here, you must turtle - and this is the most dangerous time.  Throw on Defensive Stance (remember AC isn't so important here) for the bonus to saves and added hit points.  Do your best to weather their spells and pray a little prayer to Moradin that you last.  Once the shields have fizzled, throw on Improved Power Attack and hit hard and often.  You need to fizzle a spell or three to ensure a victory.  Your evasion and high saves will help you, but you need to cause damage as quickly as possible to survive against the arcane.<br><br>Well, I hope you enjoy the build.  It's not the most uber by any stretch but it's great fun to play and quite resiliant.<br><br>And once again, if the moderator reads this please replace the old build with this one.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>King Harbromm<br><br><b>***** ***** ***** *****</b><br><i>griphook ..Added Link</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 12/26/05 15:42</span></i></p>

I would suggest you pick some elemental resistance, two to fire and as many as you can afford to acid. Fire resistance pretty much covers weapon buffs plus Elemental Shield and acid helps against Mestil's.<br>_________________<br>Surely, without war there would be no loss - hence, no mourning, no grief, no pain, no misery...
