Nice use of Harper Scout heh.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;this is the first character that i can remember that incorperates hips, selfconcealment 5 and 4 attacks per round not hasted........ </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Quite a few builds around here like that I'm sure.  I know at least my own one does (actually it gets 6 attacks dual wielding, but yours does too from the ranger levels).
