The divine power gives him no extra attacks, therefore it's not too bad, right Torias?<br><br>    Quote: Posted 03/11/04 21:45:45 (GMT) by Zynk55<br><br>    anyone have an uber monk dual wielding kamas build. or a link to one?<br><br><br>ooooh yeah....<br>so you take 4 levels in monk, 9 levels in cleric, 7 levels in weapon master, 3 more in cleric, the rest in monk. You be a human.<br>stats are the same as the build above, but you put points in strength instead of wis, after wis hits 16-18 ish. take strength and war as cleric domains, up to improved 2 weapon fighting during weapon master levels, and improved crit somewhere. you end up with 12 attacks, with a good crit range, and a high attack bonus from divine power, war domain, strength domain, superior weapon focus, lots of damage from them as well.<br><br>it's a loose build, but that's ok. get whirlwind pre-13th level, then up to improved 2 weapon fighting pre epic, take improved crit somewhere, and beef up your strength for overwhelming / devastating critical, and take improved spell resistance a few times, and you're good. cast harm on your enemies and you'll be better.<br>_________________<br>Save yourself some arm strain.
