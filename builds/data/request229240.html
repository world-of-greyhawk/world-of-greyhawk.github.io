hello all,<br><br><br>i have been trying to come up with a basic outline for a char i want to play.  this is a RP build, based loosely upon the count of monte cristo.  for those who don't know anything about this character, please do a quick search on wikipedia.<br><br>basically, i would like to have the following idea incorporated into the build, although i am not opposed the leaving things out, adding new or different idea, or whatever.  i just need some help defining what i need to do.  i would still like to be a decent (read able to be played through campaigns) char.<br><br> - strong melee presence (4 attacks per round, possible dual wielding)<br> - dark side, possibly some sort of evil alignment<br> - fairly skilled, in a wide variety of tasks<br><br>if anyone else can think of more to add to this basic outline, please do.  also, i am leaning towards a ranger/assassin based char, but anything is open at this point.<br><br>thanks for any help given and to all those that respond.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement."

Unless my literary knowledge is failing me, I don't really see how the Count of Montecristo could be a ranger or assassin. He would be evil-aligned of course, but he would still be of lawful alignment too. I'd see him like a Fighter/Rogue. Something along the line of F14/R26, maybe?<br><br>This would give you a high sneak attack (for when he fights dirty) as well as a strong melee presence, granted by fighter levels. <br><br>Here's a (very) rough draft (untested) of what I have in mind:<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Lawful Evil<br>Str: 15(28)<br>Dex: 15(18)<br>Con: 12<br>Wis: 10<br>Int: 14<br>Cha: 10<br><br><br>01: Rogue(1): Blooded, Ambidexterity<br>02: Rogue(2): Ro: (Evasion)<br>03: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Shortsword, Knockdown<br>04: Fighter(2): DEX+1, Two-Weapon Fighting, (DEX=16)<br>05: Fighter(3)<br>06: Fighter(4): Disarm, Weapon Specialization: Shortsword<br>07: Rogue(3): Ro: (Uncanny Dodge I)<br>08: Rogue(4): STR+1, (STR=16)<br>09: Rogue(5): Blind Fight<br>10: Rogue(6)<br>11: Rogue(7)<br>12: Rogue(8): STR+1, Toughness, (STR=17)<br>13: Fighter(5)<br>14: Rogue(9)<br>15: Fighter(6): Improved Critical: Shortsword, Improved Knockdown<br>16: Rogue(10): STR+1, Crippling Strike, (STR=18)<br>17: Rogue(11)<br>18: Fighter(7): Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>19: Rogue(12)<br>20: Fighter(8): STR+1, Improved Disarm, (STR=19)<br>21: Rogue(13): Great Dexterity I, Improved Evasion, (DEX=17)<br>22: Rogue(14)<br>23: Fighter(9)<br>24: Fighter(10): STR+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Shortsword, Epic Weapon Specialization: Shortsword, (STR=20)<br>25: Rogue(15)<br>26: Rogue(16): Epic Skill Focus: Hide<br>27: Fighter(11): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=18)<br>28: Rogue(17): STR+1, (STR=21)<br>29: Rogue(18)<br>30: Rogue(19): Great Strength I, Epic Skill Focus: Move Silently, (STR=22)<br>31: Rogue(20)<br>32: Fighter(12): STR+1, Armor Skin, (STR=23)<br>33: Rogue(21): Great Strength II, (STR=24)<br>34: Rogue(22)<br>35: Rogue(23)<br>36: Rogue(24): STR+1, Great Strength III, Slippery Mind, (STR=26)<br>37: Fighter(13)<br>38: Rogue(25)<br>39: Fighter(14): Great Strength IV, Epic Prowess, (STR=27)<br>40: Rogue(26): STR+1, (STR=28)<br><br>Hitpoints: 376<br>Skillpoints: 389<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/16/24<br>BAB: 27<br>AB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 32 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane studded leather/shield only): 24/30 (assuming you maxed tumble) <br><br><br>What do you think? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">

first of all, thanks for replying.  any ideas are welcome right now as i am stumped. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 02/03/06 06:38:06 (GMT) -- Saosin777<br>Unless my literary knowledge is failing me, I don't really see how the Count of Montecristo could be a ranger or assassin. <br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>i figured ranger due to his early life as a sailor.  and the assassin was due to his revenge.  but the classes themselves are rather irrelevant, since it is the general feel which i am trying to create.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>He would be evil-aligned of course, but he would still be of lawful alignment too.

You could still go Fighter/Rogue/Assassin, using the rogue levels to meet the prerequisites faster as well as chance to grab evasion, improved evasion and crippling strike. You could go Fighter12/Rogue10/Assassin18 instead of Fighter14/Rogue26, then.

Not having read the novel I cannot give advices concept wise. Build wise a FTR 10/RG 4/ *** 26, STR based looks like a nice build. You'll have a decent death attack DC also.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Thanks as well.  I will have to puzzle out whether I want to go strength based or not...dex fits the char better, but the str aspect is interesting.  perhaps a pleasant mix of the two - it is a RP char after all.  can always grab some equipment or scroll to boost whatever is needed.<br><br>thanks to all who helped.  i know i was vague, but the help and patience was much appreciated. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>-c

IMO assassin give the best results when you take lots of levels. STR based seems to work pretty well for assassin, but you are right in trying to achieve some balance.
