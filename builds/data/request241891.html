Hey everyone. Before anyone gets annoyed because I am asking for a second build, one day after I asked for my first... I am only asking out of curiosity. I still fully intend to use a Paladin. I only ask for a High AC Palemaster because it was mentioned in my Paladin thread (I dont know why) and it was said that it has really, really high AC but the guy never elaborated. I was just wondering how high of an AC it could get if:<br><br>-Level 30 server<br>-Minimum 3 levels of any class taken<br>-No Perma-Haste or Perma-TS<br>-No Shadowdancer<br>-RDD requires 12 levels of either Bard or Sorc<br>-No weapons or Armour beyond +3 enchantment<br>-No damage immunity beyond 5/- for Elements<br><br>It could focus on casting or melee, I dont care. I just want to know the potential AC. I might use it on an Arena server. (Paladin is for RP server)
