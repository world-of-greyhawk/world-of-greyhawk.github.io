I always thought Lasting Inspiration requires 21 levels of bard. Maybe I was just wrong then. Thanks for the new knowledge!

Take 8bard/8rdd/4ftr before turning lvl 21. It will give you +1 reflex save with no loss.

But from self cast buffs you can reach pretty high ABs, which in turn allows you to use power attack on top of the normal brutal hits.  (assuming you swap one of the feats for power attack like I did after looking at it).<br><br>Damage<br>2d6 greatsword<br>+15 str 2 handed<br>+6 epic specialization<br>+3 bardsong<br>+2 warcry<br>+5 gmw<br>+3 bull's<br>---<br>36 to 46 dmg from self cast buffs<br><br>+6 from +8 str items<br>---<br>42 to 52 dmg<br><br>One thing I like about this is that it's all physical damage, meaning even with a 30 soak item, you can still potentially damage a foe for 22 damage over it.  Not to mention, wounding whispers, improved invis, keen edge, gust of wind, etc, can all be very useful as a meleer type.<br><br>Unlike clerics, you don't suffer too much from dispels (bard songs cant be dispelled).<br><br>AC is potentially 5 dodge AC over most builds along with rdd lvls providing a little more (though most ftr builds now have rdd lvls), due to bardsong.  As well as 8 from tumble skill at 40.<br><br>Hope that helps, there's a few more specifics, but this build tends to be pretty strong in most PWs short of the melee life being so woefully underpowered mages are the only way to go.  Even then, this build can be quite good vs enemy mages and such, as well as damage heavily.<br>_________________<br>I may not be able to get an erection, but at least I have enough balls not to hack.
