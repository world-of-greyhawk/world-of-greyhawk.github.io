Is there anyway to get Kamiryn's Character Build Calculator to work if you don't have Excel? Or is there another build calculator out there somewhere that doesn't require Excel? If its a "no" on both of those is there a good site to refer to so I can build a character with pen and paper?<br><br>I've been trying to build character's by refering to this site and using the info on NWNWiki but there are too many rules for my orc like brain to keep track of. It makes me want to stomp on gnomes and punch elves! Help please.

You can use Open Office, it has an Excel clone that can run all the excel stuff.

Thanks Ariel. I gave your suggestion a try. Open Office opened the Character Calculator but then it froze my computer. I promptly deleted both programs. However the real reason I gave up on the Character Calculator goes back, again, to my Half-Orc like brain. I took one look at the Calculator and my brain started to lock-up much like my computer did <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif"> <br><br>Anyway thanks again for the suggestion. I think I'll stick with pen and paper though.

It just needs a little practice to use, make sure to read the readme file (doh!). Myself, I find the CBC a highly addictive program I cannot do without it.

Lazyness is a right (or else should be decreeted as one).
