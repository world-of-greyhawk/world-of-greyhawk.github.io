I rarely see EBT in people's spell lists.  I've been tinkering with a Gnome mechanic build (Wiz 35 / Rogue 5, emphasis on the INT skills, open locks, and set traps), and he uses it all the time to great effect.  You see, small sized creatures are immune to the effects of Evard's Black Tentacles.  Medium-sized and larger creatures are not (though large and huge creatures get bonuses vs the grapple check; so medium sized, dex or high caster build targets are your targets).  <br><br>Couple of things to note about EBT before your run off to exploit it.  Limit is up to 24 tentacles when maximized, 36 tentacles when empowered (yup, that's how the script calculates it).  The minimum targets is two, which means the maximum is 18 tentacles per target, even if only one target exists.  Each tentacle will then roll a grapple check at CasterLevel+8+d20 vs BAB+STRMod+SizeMod+d20 for each tentacle.  What does this mean?  At level 20, it's going to be caster 28 + d20 vs generally 28 or less (or much less) + d20.  While this advantage will diminish as you approach level 40, most higher level caster builds will have neither the STR or the BAB to get out of the way of all 18 tentacles.  The number of "hits" are recorded, and the damage tallied, but <i>the damage is applied at the end of the script</i>.  This is a big deal.<br><br>Say you get 15 hits out of those 18 in a mage duel.  That's going to be an average of 7.5 damage per tentacle, times 15 hits, times 1.5 empowered damage, for a total of 168.75 damage that a medium sized target cannot prevent in any way, only lessen with DR.  The damage is applied as bludgeoning damage, at damage_power_plus_two, but as it is applied all at once and ignores spell resistances, it's going to do blow right through an Epic Warding, Spell Mantle (and Greater Santuary) for 118.75 damage and force up to a DC 34 (40 with maxed ability bonus, easy to get with a ring of clear thought +6 and headband of intellect +6) fortitude save:<br><br>•Base 10 +<br>•Spell Level 4 +<br>•Epic Spell Focus: Conjuration 6 +<br>•Caster INT/CHA modifier +14 (+20)<br><br>Now at this point, you might be asking me, why the heck are you even bothering with this spell when you have bibgy's and IGMS?  Well, the first point is, both of those are susceptible to spell resistance/mantles or HiPs/concealment targeting loss.  Bigby's spells also do not work well vs very high AC builds.  EBT, on the other hand, is like a hand grenade.  You only have to be "close enough".  On a small battlefield, you can "wink and pepper".  Using your gnome or halfling caster under haste, alternate between GS and EBT to lay down a thick mass so that your medium sized opponent can do nothing but die.  The second point is, as this spell does not care about SR or mantles, it is a must have spell in any caster build with 17-26 caster levels.  Oh yeah, and multiple Evards in the same area stack (not one mass damage, but for multiple effects).  Lay down a minefield and pop an empowered Negative Energy Burst on the target just to reduce his grapple check by up to 5.  Give him another for good measure as there is no saving throw vs the STR drain, only the damage.<br><br>In conclusion, you're not going to be slaying any dragons with this spell.  But other high level caster builds and high dex builds with medium-sized races (the majority) will be pounded into goo with no defense except lots and lots of healing (and even then, very difficult concentration checks to make).  As a halfling or Gnome you can run around in Evard's fields as if they were summer wheat.  You aren't doing much with your level six spells offensively anyway (you're empowering/maxing IGMS), so why not give it a try?<br>_________________<br>Vulcano's <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&amp;id=6522" target="_blank">Bard Studio</a> (in beta, 1.67).  *Updated*  Compose, play, and save your own bard music dynamically in game!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Vulcano on 04/06/06 09:00</span></i></p>

I'm looking at the spellscripts now, and it doesn't check for either the casters or the target's size, ever. It's also a d20 +5 roll to see if it hits (versus AC), it seems - no caster level included in it. Perhaps your server has a custom script for it?<br>_________________<br>"And one calculates <i>time</i> from the <i>dies nefastus</i> on which this fatality arose – from the <i>first</i> day of Christianity! – <i>Why not rather from its last?</i> – <i>From today?</i> – Revaluation of all values!"

But if the tentacles are medium and your opponent is too, then the size mod is a wash, leaving 28 + d20 vs BAB + STR + d20. The variability of the d20 roll means even in epic (assuming there's a separate roll for each tentacle), you'll have a good chance of some of them hitting against non-FTR, non-STR based opponents.<br>_________________<br>Where I'm playing now: <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk.</a>

Medium sized opponents get no bonus in the script.  Small size are immune.  Large get +4 to their check, Huge get +8.  So like I said, no dragon slaying, but with 18 seperate grapple rolls, even a 30 BAB dex build is going to take some hits (30+STR+d20 vs 28+d20).  And since AoEs can stack in an area, multiple EBTs create a deadly minefield with no defense except STR and SIZE.  After further testing, I can only conclude that this new script is too powerful.<br>_________________<br>Vulcano's <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&amp;id=6522" target="_blank">Bard Studio</a> (in beta, 1.67).  *Updated*  Compose, play, and save your own bard music dynamically in game!

It's not just going to affect PvP here.  I was doing a run through of the original NWN OC for 1.67 beta 4, and there are several bosses that cast this.  Even polymorphed into Bear form for max Strength, I was getting roached.  The only way I could kill them was to let them die on their own spell...which they invariably did.  Needless to say, it was not a pleasant gaming experience.  I probably should have shifted into Badger form, as it's size class is small.  But other characters will not have this option.<br>_________________<br>Vulcano's <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&amp;id=6522" target="_blank">Bard Studio</a> (in beta, 1.67).  *Updated*  Compose, play, and save your own bard music dynamically in game!

It's official.  Same spell as I described from the beta.  Start working on your halfling ES builds.  Mine is Sorc 32/Rogue4/Blackguard4.  Don't need the higher caster level as EBT ignores all protections.

If the PW builder did something like overwrite the spellhook code, and recompiled all spell scripts, you'd have the old version of the script on that PW (because if an overwrite exists, it doesn't change on a patch unless the builder deletes it, and possibly opens the 1.67 now default version and recompiles for his hooks).

I believe the reason you are noticing an inconstistancy between the formula and the displayed DC is that your are using the "grapple check" formula used to determine whether a tentacle hits, the DC check the game is displaying is the "Paralyze Check", which is seperate from grapple and is a standard spell save check.
