Looks like a good party tank, and let me be the first to send you a Tell to get in my party.

Could you do anything to up the BAB by two to get 4 APR? Putting two PM in epic still makes your character immune to stun (though not crits), but that is only an increase of one to BAB.

i was wondering if everyone could comment on the initial stat distribution as that always seems to be my weak point.   what do you think of the current distribution? a variation i was considering was going str 11 and wis 10 to  add +1 to will saves.  the str is this build is really only to be able to carry the gear he's wearing, and oodles of heals and res scrolls.<br><br>also, any comment on my idea of forsaking iron will and lighting reflexes for an additional +2 to con?

Hmm, well you're definitely a party guy, you resist heavy damage but deal almost none, if you don't care at all for hitting and dealing damage your stats are fine, I wouldn't lower STR any more than that, you'll be wearing Heavy Plate on this guy and you need to be able to move, you also need good Discipline checks you know.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;variations:<br><br>taking resist energy sonic and electric pre-epic in place of lighting reflexes and iron will, and taking 2 great con feats post-epic to net another 40 hp and +1 to fort saves.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>No, increasing your CON is practically whorthless when you have so much HP, you need to reinforce something else that isn't so high, you have actually another two variants which are both better that the current setup:<br><br>Take Epic Energy Resistances, since the only pre-requirement is being level 21, I've no idea why you take non-epic in epic levels, that's a mistake.<br><br>On the other side you can take energy resistances pre-epic in favor of Epic Lightning Reflexes and Epic Iron Will, those are also better.<br><br>You shouldn't take out your saves feats completely, you will need saves if you're a real tanker.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

A few other things: it needs to be noted that there are 2 alignment shifts in the build-- one early and one late.  You also have over 800 hit points naturally.  It's quite easy for him to jump over a 1000.  It's been said, but dump both of those pre-epic resistance feats.  They don't stack with Epic ones.  Load up on Fire and Acid.  <br><br>If you redo this character sheet, have the class and level come first in the levelling guide.  It's easier to read and to to see how one is to level.  For instance,<br><br>1 Bard1, Toughness<br>2 Bard2<br>3 Bard3, Expertise<br>4 Palemaster1, Con19<br><br>and so on.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

another variation i was thinking about would be going 12 STR and 14 INT to give me another skill, probably concentration to be able to avoid any attempts to lower AC with taunt.
