The character primarily focus on longsword, but you can change that if you wish. I plan to change it though to stronger and better weapon(s) that can score more damage.<br><br>Character Name: "Beowulf the Slayer"<br>Gender: Male<br>Race: Human(taken for extra feat at start of the lvl. 1)<br>Class: Fighter<br>Alignment: Lawful Good<br><br>Starting Stats, and what to take, etc;<br><br>Starting (Ending) Abilities:<br>STR:16 (25)<br>DEX:13<br>CON:15 (17)<br>WIS:9<br>INT:13<br>CHA:9<br><br><br>01: Fighter 1: Dodge, Mobility, Power Attack<br>02: Fighter 2: Cleave<br>03: Fighter 3: Expertise<br>04: Fighter 4: Spring Attack<br>05: Fighter 5<br>06: Fighter 6: Great Cleave, Whirlwind Attack<br>07: Fighter 7<br>08: Fighter 8: Weapon Focus(longsword)<br>09: Weapon Master 1: Weapon of Choice(longsword), Improved Critical(longsword)<br>10: Champion of Torm 1<br>11: Champion of Torm 2: Weapon Finesse<br>12: Champion of Torm 3: Extra Smiting<br>13: Fighter 9<br>14: Fighter 10: Weapon Specialization(longsword)<br>15: Champion of Torm 4: Improved Parry, Two-weapon Fighting<br>16: Champion of Torm 5<br>17: Champion of Torm 6: Improved Power Attack<br>18: Champion of Torm 7: Toughness<br>19: Champion of Torm 8: Improved Expertise<br>20: Champion of Torm 9<br>21: Champion of Torm 10: Epic Prowess, Epic Weapon Focus(longsword)<br>22: Weapon Master 2<br>23: Weapon Master 3<br>24: Weapon Master 4: Armor Skin<br>25: Weapon Master 5<br>26: Weapon Master 6<br>27: Weapon Master 7: Epic Toughness I<br>28: Champion of Torm 11<br>29: Weapon Master 8:<br>30: Champion of Torm 12: Overwhelming Critical(longsword)<br>31: Weapon Master 9<br>32: Champion of Torm 13<br>33: Champion of Torm 14: Epic Weapon Specialization(longsword), Great Strength I<br>34: Champion of Torm 15<br>35: Champion of Torm 16<br>36: Champion of Torm 17: Devastating Critical(longsword)<br>37: Champion of Torm 18: Epic Toughness II<br>38: Champion of Torm 19<br>39: Champion of Torm 20 Epic Toughness III<br>40: Champion of Torm 21<br><br><br>Main Weapon: Unarmed<br>Attack Bonus: +38/+33/+28/+23<br>Damage: 1-3+7(critical:20/x2)<br>Fortitude: 36<br>Reflex: 32<br>Will: 25<br>Base Attack: 30<br>Spell Resistance: 0<br><br>Skills to max out:<br>Concentration: 18<br>Discipline: 50<br>Intimidate: 4<br>Listen: 24<br>Parry: 48<br>Spot: 38<br><br>Amount of Level in each class:<br>Fighter(10)<br>Weapon Master(9)<br>Champion of Torm(21)<br><br>For those who do not want to have Devastating Critical in their build, you can change it something else. It will not alter the build in any form other than the critical. With just overwhelming critical, you should be able to get at least 120 to approx. 200 or so. That is only if you equiped the character with weapon with keen, enchantment +12, and STR +12.<br><br>This character build can score critical every 7 out of 10 hits. You can add more damage using Weapon Master's Ki strike, along with Improved Power Attack. If you equip anything that gives character CON +12, the health will change from approx. 550 to approx. 800 HP depending on how you do the build(trick is to check before you "ok" the level build, check how much HP will be added, it must have more than 11+ and you will be able to get more HP out of this build by then).<br><br>More information: This build is built mainly to deal with dragons, it can easily topple ten dragon in less than 40 seconds(real time), even with just Overwhelming Critical if you chose not to have Devastating Critical. Also, if you equip the character with any items that gives him immunity to fear, you are pretty much set there.<br><br>Hope you all like this build.<br><br>Anuis<br><br><br><i>Touched up format, addedd class split in the title - Kail Pendragon</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 08/21/06 09:09</span></i></p>

I would say, great build, But perhaps instead of the three Epic toughnesses, Great strength could be taken to get 2 more strength bonus?

Anuis, Anuis, Anuis, my man. You are a bad, bad dog! You didn't put the class split int he title! I'm going to have to charge you a case of beer for that... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>Anyway, a couple suggestions and a point of note:<br><br>1) I wouldn't put points into WIS and CHA. Instead, leave them at 8 and put the extra points elsewhere (INT 14 and DEX 14 jumps out in my mind).<br><br>2) Why WM 9 and CoT 21? I'd go with CoT 22 for yet another COT epic bonus feat and +1 to all saves.<br><br>Point of note: *edit* scratch that.

I had a question about your Build. Why did you take Weapon Finnsese and Improved Parry? I thought Weapon finnese was for Dex Chars and not for a Longsword, and I had heard the the Parry skill is very weak. I'm not good at builds and such and i'm trying to learn because I always wanted to make a Parry Char but stayed away from them cuz everyone told me it was broken and a waste.

Yes yes.... forgive the old Anuis.... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>I just happened to come across my old build, looking for something that I did long time ago.

I don't remember why I took Weapon Finesse and Improved Parry. I believe the second feat, Imp. Parry, was taken before I found out that the Parry was bugged. Never took chance to update the build at that point. But Weapon Finesse... I really don't remember.<br><br>Anyway, hopefully I will be able to squeeze out one more build that will be combination of two build... if I can figure a way to incorporate two best qualities into one. Then it might will be update of two different builds. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  If I have enough time to do it this week.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.
