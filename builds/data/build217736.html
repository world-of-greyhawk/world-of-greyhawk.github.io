Nice, a build I enjoy much. EDR actually had a part in my original incarnation, but you really can't hit anything. I rebuilt to the Warpriest, so AB got quite nice. Your AB is lower, your DR is lower, but you are much more cleric. I built to be better able to handle debuffing. You are stronger when buffed, and has more spells total.<br><br>It's a solid, hard to kill build. Good hp and decent DR, and the ability to hit most opponents. Topped off with nice healing abilities. Good job, of course. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Hey, Nice build, alot of variety, just a question, in the server im playing you can get items with damage reduction.. Would that stack with your natural damage reduction or damage reduction feats?

DR from different sources does not stack.  The higher one that applies is used.<br><br>So this build has 15/- DR.

Listen. Your feats is damage REDUCTION, as are often the belts, abilities and such. Items giving Damage RESISTANCE slashing -/20 stacks just fine. Like the Greater Swordsmans belt. Two items doesn't, but an item and a feat, yes. Of coursel. Or you would be wasting a whole lot of feats and build, over what others can have in 1 belt.

Looks like a very nice build.  Cleric DD's are always pretty tough to kill.  I've seen this level split before, but with monk 6 instead of CoT 6, and it seems to work really well.  It'd be a little feat starved, compared to your build, though.
