Hi,<br><br>First posted build, so be gentle with me..<br><br>I’m playing on an Anphillia server (two clans in constant PvP, relatively high rate of leveling) and decided to check out a build that is strong at level 40, but also not a weakling while still in the teens or twenties. It’s a high-magic world, so I’m not worried that much about low saves (should I be?).<br><br>The stepped-up WM is based on the age-old principal of ‘take the money and run’ – meaning, when you can get something good, get it. This is the basic thought behind all those Rogue levels stuck pseudo-randomly in the middle – getting those rogue skills the moment I can, based upon the tumble hops (5 for another AC point).<br><br>And so, without further ado, let’s get to work..<br><br>The basics:<br>Human,<br>Lawful good (doesn’t really matter, but my personal favorite alignment for RP)<br><br>Starting (ending) abilities:<br>STR: 15 (31)<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 10<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 10<br><br>Leveling guide:<br>1	Fighter(1): Weapon Proficiency Exotic, Weapon Focus: Katana, Dodge<br>2	Rogue(1)<br>3	Fighter(2): Mobility, Expertise<br>4	Fighter(3): STR+1, (STR=16)<br>5	Fighter(4): Spring Attack<br>6	Fighter(5): Whirlwind Attack<br>7	Rogue(2): {Evasion}<br>8	Weapon Master(1): STR+1, Weapon of Choice: Katana, (STR=17)<br>9	Weapon Master(2): Improved Critical: Katana<br>10	Weapon Master(3)<br>11	Weapon Master(4)<br>12	Weapon Master(5): STR+1, Knockdown, (STR=18)<br>13	Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>14	Weapon Master(6)<br>15	Weapon Master(7): Improved Knockdown<br>16	Fighter(6): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Katana, (STR=19)<br>17	Rogue(4)<br>18	Fighter(7): Toughness<br>19	Fighter(8): Improved Expertise<br>20	Fighter(9): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>21	Fighter(10): Epic Weapon Specialization: Katana, Epic Weapon Focus: Katana<br>22	Rogue(5)<br>23	Fighter(11)<br>24	Fighter(12): STR+1, Great Strength I, Armor Skin, (STR=22)<br>25	Fighter(13)<br>26	Fighter(14): Epic Prowess<br>27	Rogue(6): Great Strength II, (STR=23)<br>28	Fighter(15): STR+1, (STR=24)<br>29	Fighter(16): Epic Toughness I<br>30	Fighter(17): Great Strength III, (STR=25)<br>31	Fighter(18): Epic Toughness II<br>32	Rogue(7): STR+1, (STR=26)<br>33	Fighter(19): Great Strength IV, (STR=27)<br>34	Fighter(20): Epic Toughness III<br>35	Fighter(21)<br>36	Fighter(22): STR+1, Great Strength V, Epic Toughness IV, (STR=29)<br>37	Rogue(8)<br>38	Fighter(23)<br>39	Fighter(24): Great Strength VI, Epic Toughness V, (STR=30)<br>40	Fighter(25): STR+1, (STR=31)<br><br>End stats:<br>Hitpoints: 588<br>Skillpoints: 263<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/16/24<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4, Traps: +1<br>BAB: 29<br>AB (max, naked): 44 (melee), 32 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/full plate and tower shield): 22/32<br><br>Skill point distribution guide (“save” is what you keep for the next level):<br>1	F	01: Discipline(4), Heal(4), Save(12), <br>2	Ro	02: Disable Trap(3), Intimidate(2), Open Lock(3), Search(3), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(5), UMD(5), <br>3	F	03: Discipline(2), Heal(2), Save(1), <br>4	F	04: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2), <br>5	F	05: Discipline(1), Save(6), <br>6	F	06: Discipline(1), Save(10), <br>7	Ro	07: Disable Trap(3), Intimidate(2), Open Lock(3), Search(3), Tumble(5), UMD(5), <br>8	WM	08: Discipline(2), Heal(2), Save(1), <br>9	WM	09: Discipline(1), Heal(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(1), <br>10	WM	10: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2), <br>11	WM	11: Discipline(1), Save(6), <br>12	WM	12: Discipline(1), Save(10), <br>13	Ro	13: Disable Trap(3), Open Lock(3), Search(3), Tumble(6), UMD(6), <br>14	WM	14: Discipline(2), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), <br>15	WM	15: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2), <br>16	F	16: Discipline(1), Save(6), <br>17	Ro	17: Disable Trap(3), Open Lock(3), Search(3), Tumble(4), UMD(4), <br>18	F	18: Discipline(2), Heal(3), <br>19	F	19: Discipline(1), Heal(2), Spellcraft(1), <br>20	F	20: Discipline(1), Save(4), <br>21	F	21: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6), <br>22	Ro	22: Disable Trap(3), Open Lock(3), Search(3), Tumble(5), UMD(2), Save(1), <br>23	F	23: Discipline(2), Heal(3), Save(1), <br>24	F	24: Discipline(1), Heal(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(1), <br>25	F	25: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(1), <br>26	F	26: Discipline(1), Save(5), <br>27	Ro	27: Disable Trap(3), Open Lock(3), Search(3), Tumble(5), UMD(2), <br>28	F	28: Discipline(2), Heal(3), <br>29	F	29: Discipline(1), Heal(2), Spellcraft(1), <br>30	F	30: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2), <br>31	F	31: Discipline(1), Save(6), <br>32	Ro	32: Disable Trap(3), Open Lock(3), Search(3), Tumble(5), UMD(2), Save(1), <br>33	F	33: Discipline(2), Heal(3), Save(1), <br>34	F	34: Discipline(1), Heal(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(1), <br>35	F	35: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(1), <br>36	F	36: Discipline(1), Save(5), <br>37	Ro	37: Disable Trap(3), Open Lock(3), Search(3), Tumble(5), UMD(2), <br>38	F	38: Discipline(2), Heal(1), Save(2), <br>39	F	39: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(1), <br>40	F	40: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(2),<br><br>Skill end results:<br>Disable Trap 24(26), Discipline 43(53), Heal 36(36), Intimidate 4(4), Open Lock 24(26), Search 24(26), Spellcraft 20(22), Tumble 40(42), UMD 28(28)<br><br>All the best,<br>DaftFox<br><br><br><br><i>Touched up format - Kail Pendragon</i><br>_________________<br>The secret to enjoying your work is to have a hobby that is even worse.

If this is pvp then ab is important to you (when is it not important).  Why 25 lvls of fighter vs 7 wm?  Maybe bump wm up to 19 or so for the ab boosts.  Its too early for me to calc the lvl difference.  <br><br>why stop at 8 rog?  9 gives you another sneak.   <br><br>And dont get me started on the stats!!  LOL   for pvp, why charisma?  why wisdom?  thats 4 skills to use for strength.   Maybe pull one off dex (13  you need 12 for fp and 13 to qual for wm  iirc).  Try to end strength on a positive number (please dont tell me its cuz you find +3 gauntlets of ogre power more frequently on the server.. its HIGH MAGIC).  LOL<br><br>Going 25 fighter doesnt give you as much as 19 or 22 wm would.  Its up to you though.  with all the rog lvls you may even be able to get 25 wm...  its really up to you though.  Doin all these types of changes really isnt part of this forum.  If you were to do these  then this should have been posted in the suggestions forum.<br><br>good luck.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Thanks avado,<br><br>the fighter levels are for the bonus feats, although I just used them up for toughness which, after you pass the 500HP mark, isn't quite a factor anymore I guess.<br><br>CBC tells me that going the WM route would add 5 to AB (49 instead of the measly 44 I scored with this one).<br><br>Another thing is that Anph. is an RP server, but I really can write off those WIS and CHA, and get my STR up 2 and CON up 1. However with all the high magic around, I really can get to high STR without too much trouble (did I high magic? steep would be a better word for it..)<br><br>anyways, it's a change worth looking into - thanks for pointing that out.<br><br>DF<br>_________________<br>The secret to enjoying your work is to have a hobby that is even worse.

It's not really that your STR won't get high, rather, CHA is absolutely worthless an WIS is only good for Will saves, which suck anyway, try to get something that makes you immune to mind effects instead.<br><br>You're taking 25 Fighter levels and you don't get Great Strength VII!? that's just so wrong, you're ending with an odd STR score because of it, you should try to keep attribute scores at pair numbers.<br><br>Yeah, that's way too much Fighter, either Weapon Master or Rogue would be better (sneak damage or AB), every bonus feat you took on Epic Toughness is a level you could've invested better on another class.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
