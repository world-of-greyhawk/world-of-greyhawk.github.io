You can toss in some Rogue levels for skill dumps. Go Fighter 10/WM 10 pre-epic, WM 18 in epic (the last 2 can be whatever you want - more fighter for another feat, Rogue for skilldumps, SD for HiPS, etc.).<br><br>But if you are going dex-based, I would recommend sacrificing a few points of AB to pick up Epic Dodge.

I picked KD/IKD instead of going for the TWF feats since IKD lets you do sneak damage - I think an extra 7d6 on 4 attacks is more useful than 2 extra attacks at 1d4 + 6 + weapon enhancement. <br><br>Note that you could take Epic Dodge much earlier if you either give up the final skill dump at level 39, or drop 3 WM levels for 2 fighter and 1 rogue (costs 1 AB point). I prefer this way if you can create it at level 40, but dropping the 3 WM levels will make levelling much easier if you have to build him up.<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 03/21/06 21:21</span></i></p>

Thanks for the suggestions... and the above build is a great build but for the server I play on.. it will have around a 65 AB which is average.

In high-magic worlds, AC always trumps AB because you can only add a max of +20 to your AB via magic, but you can +100 to AC (+20 each to armor, dodge, shield, deflection, and natural). What you might want to consider is taking a dex-based fighter/monk/rogue or fighter/monk/sd. By focusing on dual kamas, you can get 10 attacks per round, which gives you a good chance to roll 2 natural 20's in a round (you will have a 40% chance of 1 20 in a round, and a 15% chance of 2). <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>I thought maybe a dex fighter might be the way to go in this case since I can probably eek out a few more AB points.

It will get you Epic Dodge. The big deal about that is that it makes you opponents need not 1, but 2 20's in a single round to hit you. That's probably why you can't hit the others. If you only have 5 attacks per round, your odds of getting 2 20's are only 4% (1 in 25 rounds). That's if they don't have any concealment. Compare that to a non-epic dodger with high AC, where you will get one natural 20 23% of the time (about 1 in every 4 rounds).<br><br>But the real way to get around that high AC is to become a spellcaster.<br><br>TM

Listen to me. Since you get 65 AB with TM's build, i assume you can get maxed out STR or DEX and a +9 weapon. Paladin16/Fighter2/WM22 STR based. Forget CHA, have 14WIS, 13 int and DEX. 15 STR. should get your STR to 32. AB naked with WoC will be 50. Add max STR for 56, a plus 9 weapon for 65 (the same as TM's build), then add bless, parayer for 67, add to that divine favor for 72. Now here is what you do. Have bless and aid up, Cast divine favor, taunt your enemy(for an effective AB up to 78!!) and smash loose. WM and STR based quickly carves up anything it can score a decent amount of hits on. People tend to forget Paladins when talking about high AB, but they're a max AB class with okay buffs. This build assumes Human, though. Your AC won't be up there, so you'll take some hits early on. I have no idea what you are up against, but this guy should be able to score hits!<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

It depends on what you are up against. If it is just high AC, Grimnir's idea is good. If it is Edpic Dodge and/or SCV, then you still have a problem, because the first swing is a guaranteed miss, and the second is a probably miss (if either the first or second swings fail due to the concealment). So the first swing likely to have a chance of landing will be swinging at -10, so it will probably still need a 20.<br><br>The best way to deal with the ED characters is to get lots of attacks (preferably with multiple players beating up on a single ED'er). And be sure to take Blindfight if you think they have concealment.<br><br>Here is a quick comparison of the odds of hitting at least 1 time during a round when you need a 20 to hit. the first number is the odds of hitting with 5 attacks per round, the second number is the odds of hitting with 10 attacks per round:<br><br>#attacks:		5   |	10	<br>No Ed or SC:		22.6% | 40.1%	<br>ED:			4.2% |	14.8%<br>SCV:			11.9% |	22.4%<br>SCV &amp; BF:		17.4% |	31.8%	<br>ED &amp; SCV:		1.1% |	4.6%	<br>ED &amp; SCV &amp; BF:		2.5% |	9.2%	<br><br>As you can see, ED really drops the odds with 5 attacks. If that's what they have, I recommend you get it and get as many attacks per round as possible, and don't worry about the AB.<br><br>Or, find another server. I find fights between players with ED and SCV to be very boring - you get hit once every 10 rounds or so for small damage, when you get to half hitpoints you chug a heal potion, repeat until either someone runs out of heal potions or you get bored.<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 03/22/06 14:23</span></i></p>

If you need a 20 to hit, I don't need advanced maths to tell me someone with 10 attacks/round has a better chance to hit than one with 5 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">  <br><br>But he said AC in mid 80's. If that's the truth, an effective AB of 78 should be enough, at least in a strength WM. Assume scimitar for weapon. 5 attacks/round, need to hit: 7/12/17/20/7. In that order each round. That would be 2 to 3 hits pr round. Let's say he can get 3, since holy weapon dispels his opponent <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  . That is 6 hits in 2 rounds, Epic dodge will remove 2, and concealment will remove 1 more. Then you are left with 3 hits in 2 rounds, and he would be lucky if not at least 1 was a crit. Your last attack each round is at max AB, remember that, since it is an important thing against ED'ers.<br><br>If he will need 20 anyhow, which he did not ask for, don't worry about what AB you can get. Go Fighter for EWS, Monk for 10 attacks and STR based. Fight with either Imp Expertise or even Imp Power attack. It would help a lot if you could specify more what you fought. <br>but for mid 80's AC, ED and SC V won't save him if you can get AB to 78. If someone has those feats he won't deal much damage either, luckily. With 78 AB, you might consider spamming KD or Called shot: Leg too.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

OK.. some more information....<br><br>Non-Spellcasters and Monks do not have access to certain items on the server for I am guessing balancing purposes.  These classes are mainly limited to +5 items.<br><br>The AC items are +7 for armor, shield, helm, +10 Dodge boots.<br><br>The AB weapons for this group top out at +9.<br><br>A typical dex character with access to items can get around 79 AC with a 68 AB.<br><br>A typical str character with access to items can get around a 72 AC with a 68 AB.<br><br>Add to this equation "Regeneration" (A process where after one levels up to level 40 then remakes a new level one character with a +2 stat bonus to a stat of choice) where the max regeneration bonus is +12 to stat or +6 to hit/damage, AC etc.<br><br>As you can see if you are a senior player on the server with a dex character your AC and AB can top out at 85 and 74 respectively.<br><br>Also if you make a pure build (40 levels in one class) there is a +10 stat bonus as well.<br><br>So a pure caster can have a 72 stat (I assume that Epic Sorcerers get Great Charisma as a bonus feat)  A pure fighter can have a 68 strength however, going heavy in Weaponmaster yields more base AB than going pure Fighter.<br><br>As far as items available... assume you can get +12 in any stat, no resistances and some physical and elemental immunities stackable to around 50% on average.  Wands are available to those who can craft them.  True Sight is available via spell or one item on the server which is a ring.  Bonuses to any skill is readily available through the crafting system in place as well as low level immunities such as poison, fear and disease and haste.<br><br>What I described above are averages... the better players of course have builds that are above those averages but of course sacrifice something in order to have those advantages.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Halston Vega on 03/25/06 00:21</span></i></p>

If they took Improved Expertise (and they should), they can pump it to 89. The typical character (str or dex) has a 68 AB, so can only hit on a 20. With ED, that means they will very rarely hit at all. The Dexer's AB will drop to 58 vs. a 72 AC on a str-basd char, so they will hit about 25% or so on the first attack, plus 5% for the remaining attacks.<br><br>The special characters with super high abilities are the same - assuming the same gap between AB and AC, a str-based or dex-based will boost their AB by +11 (from the listed +12 ability from regeneration, +10 from pure class). The str-based has the same 72 AC from before, and an AB of 79. The dex-based char has the same 79 AB, but their AC jumps to 90 (100 with IE active). So they can still force the str-based char to need a 20 to hit, and with ED that means rarely. An even with IE, they will have an AB of 69, enough to hit the 72 AC of the str-based character at will.<br><br>TM
