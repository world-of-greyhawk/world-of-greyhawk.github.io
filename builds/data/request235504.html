I really have no play experience with non-divine types, but here's an idea I was kicking around. I'm aware it's not in official submission form - looking for more feedback before I commit the time to crossing Ts and dotting Is. There's no builds like this and I'd like to know what's wrong with it.<br><br>Elven Illusionist 15 / PM 16 / CoT 9<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 18 + 7 + 4<br>Con 12<br>Int 16 + 3<br>Wis 10<br>Cha 8<br><br>Distribution Pre 20 is Wiz 4 PM 8 CoT 8 - this gives 16 BAB by 20.

Your pre-epic progression won't work, as you need BAB +7 to qualify for CoT. You won't get that with a WIZ/PM mix until level 14, leaving only 6 levels for CoT. The best you can do is something like WIZ 6/PM 8/CoT 6 or WIZ 4/PM 10/CoT 6 (or more WIZ and less PM). As such, there's no way this mix of classes can get 4 attacks per round.<br><br>Another problem would be your caster level is only going to be 4 at level 20. Even though PM adds higher level spell slots, it doesn't add to your caster level for things such as spell durations, spell power, and beating spell resistance. That means until you qualify for CoT (and even for a while after), you won't be much of a caster, and you won't be much of a fighter.<br><br>As a DEXer without sneak attack and very low STR, you won't be able to do much damage either.<br><br>I think this is one of those builds that looks good on papaer, but you'll find falls far short of expectations in practice. It would probably be extremely tough to level.<br><br>That being said, I'd recommend trying it out in a leveller and seeing what the results are like. You never know, you may come up with something workable out of it.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Ah - I was thinking PM was 3/4 BAB, due to its melee combat focus.  Bad assumption - should have checked my facts.<br><br>Looks like I should drop him and reconstruct as an Oozemaster with the PrC.
