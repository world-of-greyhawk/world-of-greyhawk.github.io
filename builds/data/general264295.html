I've been messing around with a few shifter ideas, mainly Risen Lord shape. Although in, for example, the Risen Lord form, all stats are overwritten, if I have a high constitution, (and hence high HP) does this mean I have more HP when in the Risen form than if I had a low constitution?

In other words, your natural Con does not effect your total hp in Risen Lord form.<br>_________________<br>(I enjoy writing parenthetically (a lot)).
