I wanted to remind everybody in the guild about few things.<br><br>Firstly, there is new release of PrC that recently has been released. To find the link to it, look for it in the PrC forum, in sticky topic by Lockindal.<br><br>Secondly, we still need more information about the classes before it would be compiled into database for those who want to use it. It need to have more information about other classes, there are some that has not been discussed, such as Champion of Torm, Dwarven Defender, and many others.<br><br>Lastly, we need to find someone who would be willing to host a module on the server, which can be open 24/7. We are trying to set up a tournament, which can be held over several days at different times so the people can have chance to compete.<br><br>Thank you in advance!<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.

Hey all,<br>I have the space to host the mod for you, and the connection (T3). The only issue is how many people are you planning on having at the same time. Right now the poor little guy is a P3 500 with 128MB of RAM running Redhat 9. It has been very stable so far, if you want to try it out, give me a shout or an email.<br><br><a href="mailto:mmcdaniel@intelimaxx.net">mmcdaniel@intelimaxx.net</a><br><br>~E~<br>_________________<br>It's not a bad partnership.

Would there be any voluteeners for testing the server?<br><br>The only time I can go line is around after 1 p.m. til possibly 10 p.m.<br><br>If we can get enough players who have common time, we can then go on the server and see how many players that the server can hold before it starts to lag.<br><br>Oh that reminds me, could you post the name of the server and the address for it? Anyway, you can put up any module that is large enough for the testing purpose. The module is not completely finished, so it will be while before it will be completed. Any module with leveling up NPC will be fine.<br><br><b>Name | Time can be on MP</b><br><br>1.

Found one problem with the server, it does not allow the local character to join the game.

We might have to look over the rules again. I don't even remember most of the rules. But, yes, it has to be fairly original, and other was that you can't use enchanted items, other than the means of spell enchanted(spell-caster class are those that has the ability to do that).<br><br>As for those who are probably not reading the thread, you are welcome to make new thread that focuses solely on the tournament.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.
