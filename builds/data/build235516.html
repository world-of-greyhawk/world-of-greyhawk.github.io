The hips will help for sure.  I am interested in what you guys think. I think the skill points may need to be moved around a bit.<br><br><br><i>Added links - Kail Pendragon</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 04/10/06 01:52</span></i></p>

Well, first I would change your levelling order - you are losing 2 BAB by going Druid 10/Cleric 9/SD 1 pre-epic. Go Drui 12/Cleric 8 or Druid 8/Cleric 12 pre-epic, take SD 1 at level 21, and you gain 2 AB (brings it to 15, so you still get the extra attack at full AB from DP). <br><br>Second, I would probably skip the Spell Penetration feats. With only a max of 24 caster levels, you can only get to 30 penetration anyway, so I would just skip those. When you face something with high SR, buff, change into DS, and melee. I would take Empower Spell (nice for buffs), and KD/IKD or Disarm/Imp Disarm (both excellent feats for a dragon). I would also bump Int to 14 to qualify for them (will help with skills as well, but drop Dex to 12). If you drop Combat Casting, you can take both (but not Empower). In epic, replace Epic Spell Pen with Epic Prowess, Armor Skin, or Improved Crit: Unarmed.<br><br>Use the extra skill points to max Hide and MS (without those, HiPS is worthless, and you gave up all that cheesy monk AC to get HiPS, so make it count). With no Discipline, you will want to make KD-immunity items a priority, especially when in human form.<br><br>TM

Ok this is my first build so bare with me.  I switch the leveling order a bit and took your recomendations on the feats. But I cannot change my int to 14 because I must have 13 for dodge and mobility. <br>But I agree he need to have way more hide and move silently so I will drop the epic spell <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">   <br>Then that will free up all those spellcrafr points I think . How many does he really need? <br><br>I like the suggestions though thanks for the quick response I won't post the modified one until I am done tweakin it.<br><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 03/30/06 18:21:01 (GMT) -- Tattoed Monk<br><br> I would also bump Int to 14 to qualify for them (will help with skills as well, but drop Dex to 12). <br><br><br>TM</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By drumnbassjunkie on 03/30/06 19:01</span></i></p>

Forgot about the dex requirement. In that case, drop Str to 8 and leave Dex at 14. The str gets replaced in almost all of your forms anyway, and you can cast empowered Bull's Str for some carrying capacity in human form. You really want to get both the skill points and qualify for IKD and/or Improved Disarm with a dragon build.<br><br>TM

I know that tumble works in fives but the modified score at 43 is 45. Not sure if there is a cap at 40 or the modified tumble at 45 really would add +9 to your ac.  Which is why I left it at 43.  <br><br>Thanks

I would prefer more Cleric over Druid pre-epic, i think Clerics give more playability, but that's just for taste. 8 STR makes it harder pre-epic, since you won't be wearing heaviest armor, even with Bulls. You could get DS later, and take one more Great WIS, allowing you to start with 17 WIS, freeing enough to  have STR 10, DEX 13, INT 14 and even 2 left. I don't know though, DS is good to get ASAP, but it is also good to ease up on levelling difficulty. As for SD, either take it at lvl 21 like you do, or ASAP to get HiPS for increased playability en masse.<br><br>PS: If you play this on a PW, get a DM to change your name to Summoned Dire Wolf, call your animal companion for it too and then summon a dire wolf.

Most of the good suggestions have been given already. You could go druid 15 and get 8th lvl druid spells and spell slots (extended AoV).

Also, if you decided to do Cleric 23/Druid 15/SD 2, you would get one higher AC in Dragon Shape via Barkskin (and Barkskin does convert over to Dragon Shape, in addition to + to AC from equipment). Also, as Kail mentioned, you would get 8th level Druid spells.
