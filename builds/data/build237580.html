The purpose of this build is to take advantage of divine power adding TWO additional crossbow attacks (in conjunction with rapid reload and haste) for a total of five Dev Crit heavy crossbow attacks per round.  With its wider threat range, it will average one Dev Crit attack per round on targets with less than 50 AC, and at range instead of up close.  Even if the range is closed, the Undead xploit xbow (henceforth known as UXX) is still immune to critial hits, and has both Epic Mage Armor and Epic warding.  On the downside, it is very weak magically, and won't beat a lot of SR, even with Mord's (unless the server updates the CasterLevel function to take palemaster levels into account, then it's fine PvM).  It's near impossible to level as well, as its strengths are not achieved until very late in the build.  But it's kinda fun at the end, so I'm posting it.

That's impressive. The unbuffed AB is low for a ranged character, but it's if your calculations are correct it's so lethal it doesn't matter. My only concern is the short duration of epic warding, and the ability to fight other crit immune casters.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

The unbuffed BAB has to be low, because at level 20 you end up at 10 (20 at level 40).  This is to generate the extra attack from the Divine Power calculations; otherwise, you only get four.  Needs some items, but the plan is to sneak up on creatures, blast them flat footed, then sanc and hide again if they close the gap.  Against crit immune, he's generally screwed.  I thought of adding more firepower by gaining Dev Crit: Longsword.  This would cost me still spell and the autostills, and one other feat.  But, this would allow for him to combine Tenser's Transformation with Divine power and get 7 Dev Crit longsword attacks per round, all at the +20 cap (though at a lower DC 35 because STR in shifted form is lower).  I've tested it and it works, as long as DR isn't a problem.  If DR is a problem, he could buff himself and get five attacks with better gear, still at near +50 base attack.<br>_________________<br>Vulcano's <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&amp;id=6522" target="_blank">Bard Studio</a> (in beta, 1.67).  *Updated*  Compose, play, and save your own bard music dynamically in game!
