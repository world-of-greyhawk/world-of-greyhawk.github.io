I pretty much have decided the overall template that would work best in the PW I am playing. Unfortunately my experience is very limited in this regard. In the PW I play there is a healthy dose of demons at the highest levels and other critters with a very large AC which makes the cleric/Fighter/CoT template work out the best. <br><br>What I would like to know is what skills and other class specific items I should take while levelling up this char. I plan on starting with fighter then taking 20 levels of cleric before turning to CoT. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. The primary weapon he will be using is a scimitar. Thanks in advance for any help!
