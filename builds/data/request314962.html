Hi all, once again i would need help on a build. I would like to make a wizard/tank shifter. I will take EK as my third class to boost AB as high as possible but I was wondering if I should spend a lots of points in strenght to boost AB even more or if I should spend my attributes points in INT to get more spells instead. Anyone as advices for me to make an effectiver build?<br><br>thx<br>_________________<br>K.M.  aka Chillychill<br><br>"Y'a pire que ne pas pouvoir, y'a savoir qu'on peut et ne jamais tenter"

In shifting, your stats are over written.  Taking str in a shifter build is ONLY good for dev crit (creature) which you can do with PRC (i have a few variants in ECB PRC forum here).  Going int based wizard with shifter isnt the smartest thing as you have shapes that get spells FREE (rak, for example).  The only thing i have really seen is to get enough caster lvs to cast Max ice storm for rak shape.   Other than that, you need to focus in PRC.  The builds of your opponents can get mighty hard fast, and by diversifying like you suggest, you WILL gimp yourself (you have to put vanilla nwn behind you cuz the rules are not even the same game).
