Epic Character Builds - The Death Dealer <br>Created by: Deborah “Tyr”<br><br>He is a blood-thirsty assassin, an epic monk turned mercenary, and pirate (fighter) commander, but it's not that he lacks charm or grace. With impeccable martial arts mastery, and devout attention to anatomy and stealth, he’s mastered the art of death: his palm incredibly swift, more deadly than any blade, with a body tougher than plate armor. <br><br>As an epic monk, bolstered by levels of fighter and the prestige class of assassin, this character excels in the art of dealing quick, lethal blows, and takes great pride in his work. The horror he’d see in the eyes of his victims, their blood-soaked bodies crumpling to the ground as they gasped their last breath, pleased him. Satisfied with his kill, he’d soon disappear into the shadows, making his getaway under cover of stealth, and be far, far away before any hint of the crime was discovered. Yes, he was a murderer, a cold-blooded mercenary, and he loved it. And this, his love of the “kill”, the rush he always experienced when running his victims through, when toying with them like a dire tiger mauling a tiny mouse, might even have been forgiven by the Order. Nothing is wrong perhaps, with a devout monk, a monk who had trained hard to be a stealth killer, taking a little pride in his work; but only if he refrained from bragging about it, and the kill was done to advance the goals of the Order. Unforgivable, however, was his love of gold, and the way it shimmered. It was gold that made Death Dealer sing, for which he was cast from the Order. <br><br>At first, he was upset enough to plot revenge, but he soon got on with his life as a mercenary. His title as outlaw, atop his already impeccable credentials, clearly worked to his favor in his line of work. In time, he would receive a special assignment, one which would lead him back to the Order, on a mission to terminate his old Master. His skills having been honed since that day, so long ago, when he was cast out, Death Dealer was up for the challenge; he would have his revenge. It was quite easy for Death Dealer to enter his old temple, unnoticed by a single soul, but the Master was out. So, Death Dealer waited. Not a sound, not a stir did he make; patiently, he waited. When the Master did return, on entering his room, the trap was instantly sprung. Like a bolt of lighting, and with shocking precision, Death Dealer leaped. In an instant, he had bested his former master; it took but a single blow. The dying man whispered, one final breath: “Why kill me now, after all of these years?” <br><br>Perhaps, out of respect, the Death Dealer responded with an answer. “You have trained me well, Master, from whom I learned great discipline; I take my vengeance now because it tastes sweeter when cold, and because your death is finally worth something to me in gold.”<br><br>The Death Dealer is evil because he is a mercenary, a highly trained killer-for-hire: his loyalties are bought and sold by only the highest of bidders.<br><br>Author’s Note: the Death Dealer is based on a real-life, historical figure: Eustace the Monk. Dubbed also the “Black Monk,” he was the son of a noble, spending time at a monastery before becoming a pirate commander, and mercenary. His ability to seemingly appear out of nowhere, and fighting prowess, resulted in many believing he practiced sorcery; he was an assassin, an epic monk turned mercenary, who satisfied his thirst for gold by selling his services to the highest bidder. Being one of the most notorious mercenaries of his day, he is the perfect medieval outlaw, and an irresistible villain-type character.<br><br><br>This is a stealth build, a sneaker, with the power of sneak attack and good first strike damage, who can follow-through with melee. This build will give you naturally high AC, and a really nice amount of immunities, saves, and spell resistance: basically, making it tough for any caster to hit you with anything and, with some minimal equipment, the same goes for any fighter. As long as you make sure to have some death immunity and negative level protection in your equipment, there are few spells or effects that can effectively touch you. <br><br>The Death Dealer is designed for PvM/Single-Player, from level 1-40; all good villains are welcome in PvP, however (note: check with your DM/Host as some might have an alignment issue, in which case it might require prior approval).   <br><br><br>Overview<br><br>The Death Dealer - Monk (20), Fighter (10), Rogue (10)<br><br>Race: Human         <br>Alignment: Lawful Evil<br>Max.

Similarly, it should offset some, if not many, of the penalties otherwise applicable to him if dual-wielding Kamas, making these attacks more effective, regular, and consistent.

Modifications (Dated May 30, 2006):<br><br>After receiving wise advice from many, including an official confirmation regarding the applicability of a certain feat which I truly do appreciate, (and responding also to an interesting challenge, I must say, from our very own Thax <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   , modifications were made to the Death Dealer for your fun and enjoyment as follows: <br><br>* Switched leveling/class order around, to get rid of the XP Penalty entirely (note: other version of this build was hampered by 10-12 levels of 20-% XP penalty, which may not be huge per se or bug many, but was a little unsettling, such that I rearranged and adjusted a lot around to eliminate the XP penalty entirely);<br><br>* in the process, dropped 3 rogue levels, and 1 monk, in exchange for more fighter; doing this, in addition to eradicating the penalty as above aforesaid, we happily gain additional feats slots and other desirable benefits: i.e., to wit, AB is raised, HPs raised, and AC is also raised. <br><br>* This led to a drop in rogue sneak damage, however, from 7d6 to 5d6. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">    Then again, with AB raised, and UMD now maximized, the modifications should actually result in much more effective use of all those attacks, including kamas, and thus equate to more overall damage (ihits = more damage. While former AB was fine for PvM (for which this character was and remains designed), could be better if taken to a PvP server. These changes (i.e., +1 AB and more UMD (which, in turn, enables this charater to further buff his own AB via UMD/scrolls). AC, more HPs, increased STR, and other changes reflect that. As such, even more adaptable than before for PvP, but still designed for PvM.<br><br>* Theory and concept of build ptherwise fully retained, as are all the great monk benefits, save the Stunning Fist (now relegated to a parlor trick after the first few levels; then again, it was in the other build, too). In the end, these changes, fine-tuning and tweaks should make the character even more playable from level 1, which is a good thing.<br><br><br>Enjoy!<br><br>- Tyr  <br><br>PS. Notwithstanding, even managed to fit in the epic dodge feat a tad bit sooner that in the previous build; okay, just a couple levels sooner than where it was, but still, NO XP penalty (which otherwise would have been the case), improved AB, and UMD skill dump also.  <br><br>Stealth remains fully max'd, with the "extraneous" skills tossed out - Thanks, folks. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  <br><br><br>yeah, yeah, <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">   shutting up now; said more than enough; what a team I tells ya on this one (thanks!)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Robert Tyr on 05/30/06 21:52</span></i></p>

39 AC for dual weild is nothing special, but if you need the AB you can go over to unarmed. This also gives you multiple damage types (helps with low damage).<br><br>5d6 sneak attack ... ouch. Still, no real problem. Given you have improved knockdown and a potential 10 attacks per round, you can deal at least 15d6 in sneaks a round. Try pulling a knockdown with your fists and then switching to kamas ...<br><br>Epic Dodge still comes in irritatingly late, but it's no real problem.<br><br>Overall - good AC, fair AB, sneaking ability, UMD, and epic dodge. Very nice, well done. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>CATS!

Wow - talk about the "olympics" of character building....cool! And Cats, thanks for the cookie - <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    (Means a lot coming from you). Finn, merci tres beaucoup, et Thax, a toi aussi! Great team effort! <br><br>Thax: good to see ya! Dual-wield, didn't forget about you - if going PvP, picking this character up post-epic (i.e., level 40) rather than playing it through, take AMBI at level 6 (instead of extra stunning), TWF instead of Iron Will, and finish with ITWF instead of armor skin. Can then use his/her UMD/scroll buffs to increase AB on dual-wield kamas, not just unarmed strike but also dual-wield, instead of simply adjusting for dual.    <br><br>I don't recommend doing this, though, if playing it through. While this character's "blessed" by the monk, so to speak, completely immune to mind-spells/mind-effects, doesn't get the full immunity until monk level 20; as such, while waiting for the full immunity to kick in, I put the iron will feat in pre-epic; with the idea being his unarmed's good - kama's are small, and IKD... <br><br>But, ...<br>if picking this guy up post-epic (or level 40 for PvP), when he's got all those nice monk immunities in tact, the iron will feat back pre-epic will be a total waste; thus, opening up the ITWF option, should you want (cool challenge, thanks; didn't forget about you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   <br><br>As to XP penalties - tough call; a few levels at 20% isn't that bothersome to me, but yikes, the reactions on that from this wonderful crowd - it was rough, rough I tells ya (and hence, we just don't go there) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  <br><br>Great team effort, guys and gals.

Alright - reporting back re: the so-called "awesome kama" deal ---- as fun as it's been, truly it has, his unarmed focus is much, much better, and will work just fine, with IKD the unarmed AB, then swithching to Kamas for the sneak attacks. Repeat as necessary, be it PvM or PvP. If the creature/character's immune to sneak, you're gonna want that unarmed strike. No matter how you slice it, Kamas are low damage, and there's no escaping this fact. Different result, perhaps, if this were a Monk/FTR/WM with dev.crit and STR based, but it's not . . . this is a sneaker who can melee, such that switching to a kama-focus solely would really hamper  this character, as he'd only have the one type (i.e., low) damage. <br><br>So, as fun as it's been, and it has, in the wise words of Cats:<br><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 05/30/06 23:26:14 (GMT) -- avarielo<br><br>39 AC for dual weild is nothing special, but if you need the AB you can go over to unarmed. This also gives you multiple damage types (helps with low damage).<br><br>5d6 sneak attack ... ouch. Still, no real problem. Given you have improved knockdown and a potential 10 attacks per round, you can deal at least 15d6 in sneaks a round. Try pulling a knockdown with your fists and then switching to kamas ...<br><br>Epic Dodge still comes in irritatingly late, but it's no real problem.<br><br>Overall - good AC, fair AB, sneaking ability, UMD, and epic dodge.
