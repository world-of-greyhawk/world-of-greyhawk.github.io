ahh..that is better.  now i was wondering, where does this build fit in in terms of a party, or at least in which manner you recommend playing this char.<br><br>i imagine this is a sort of tank which can deal some decent damage thanks to pally spells and DD damage reduc.  very interesting idea.  seems pretty powerful too.<br><br>thanks to UMD, this char can also perform some basic rogue functions in a party using the right spells and equipment to augment abilities.  obviously nothing epic, but trap setting, lock opening and other such skills can be boosted, although not very high.  buffing through spells is a nice feature too.  summons.  getting in some sneak attacks.  the more that i look at this build, the more i appreciate it.  but with only a one in trap setting, even with a lot of dex equipment and some one with land scrolls this char can't do much.  open locks i can understand with +10 lockpicks helping out, but trap setting and disarming can get tough.  i suppose there is some good rogue equipment to help with this out there.<br><br>nicely done.  and many thanks to griphook God of Typo for fixing this up.  now I get it!<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Many that live deserve death.

Find Traps scrolls will get you through on that side but nothing lets you set traps, so that might be where to go.  Build to taste, as I say.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;nicely done.  and many thanks to griphook God of Typo for fixing this up.  now I get it!<br><br>-c</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>thanks, C, and thanks always to Grip and to the guild broadly for helping me through what I will call my brief dwarf phase.<br><br>Cheers.
