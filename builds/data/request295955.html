Hey all, i'm looking for a build that uses the two-handed greatsword and has a significant melee presence. I understand that there is a significant AC drop from the usual 'sword and board' type of fighter. Here are my requirements.<br><br><br>Human<br>Can use any class except the following (Sorc, wiz, druid, palemaster, bard (except 3 levels) , palemaster, RDD, Assassin, shifter,cleric)<br>Uses cloth armour (Dex build I assume would be the best for this)<br>Would be based on both PvM and PvP<br>Good or True Aligned<br><br>Environment<br>+5 Equipment at best though faction leaders get +6<br>Keen can be found on some weapons<br>Elemental damage does not exceed 2d6<br>High Magic area<br>Most enemies are immune to sneak and must be melee'd<br>True Seeing not uncommon<br>Items included in the world are from NWN pallette (IE Ac Ring +5)<br><br><br><br>I have tried Avendesoras Ko'di Blademaster and still have trouble with it due to low AC, though it is a good build.<br><br><br>Any help with this would be appreciated guys <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  especially if you give me a clue as to how to equip him (I am a goof with some of these things)

I can't get my head around the cloth armor part.  Is that mandatory?  If so, I would recommend a Paladin20/CoT15/Harper5, still go a mix of Strength and Charisma, and rely on Divine Shield to keep your AC up as well as Harper's Cat Grace and its Cats Grace potion making so that you can raise your naked AC by 4-10, and then rely on just one minor Dex item to fill the gap to give you Full Plate AC equivalence.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Monk 25/FTR 8/Rogue 7 (Monk 12/FTR 4/Rogue 4 preepic) will net you 40 AB, 29 naked AC, 4apr, WS/EWS, 180% speed, mind immunity, Empty Body, 29 Fort and 28 Ref saves (LoH, Strong Soul, Great Fortitude, Lightning Reflexes), IE, Improved Disarm (to make good use of that Great Sword which hurts your apr), 442 HPs, epic trap skills (maxed), maxed Discipline, Search, Tumble, UMD and a bunch of skillpoints to be put where you want (OL, Listen, etc.). Starting abilities all 14 but CHA 8, you end at 30 STR.

How about a DwD build? You won't have great AC, but on the other hand you won't particularly notice it if you get hit, either. Something along the lines of Fighter 4/Rogue 10/DwD 26.

Oops, I missed the Human requirement.<br><br>In that case, since you can't go dex-based with a Greatsword, I would second a Pally build. Mix of Str for AB and Cha for DM/DS. Could use some Monk instead of Rogue if you want a bit more AC and don't need UMD. Say Fighter 6/Pal 16/Monk 18, or Pal 20/Monk 20. You pick up a few points of AC from the monk levels, a few points from Wis, Empty Body from Monk 18 for concealment, and you can use DS for some more from Cha. Should get to a fairly decent AC and AB when buffed.<br><br>TM

Avendesoras Ko'di Blademaster with no armor will bleed in combat.<br>To avoid some damage, you can improve the AC with dexterity items and wisdom items. +12 to dex and wis is the cap so each can give a +6 to AC.<br>Try to get as high bonus to Natural AC, Deflection AC, Armor AC and Dodge AC as possible. Dodge AC from different sources stack up to a cap of +20 AC.<br><br>You should also get items that grant Damage Resistance and Damage Reduction. <br><br>The Ko'di Blademaster will do better in high magic environments. If you can combine many sorces of high bonus to AC, at some point that will give a better AC than what most builds can penetrate with the available AB bonus. High damage resistance will lessen the hurt when they hit on a 20 roll.<br>At that point Avendesoras build still has a fair AB and deals a great amount of damage when it hits.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

Don't know why I didn't think of this one sooner. Originally it was an Elf build that got both ED and Dev Crit. As a human, you can only get one or the other (I would recommend ED, since you can't wear heavy armor).<br><br>Fighter(10), Shadowdancer(11), Weapon Master(19), Human<br><br>STR: 16 (24)<br>DEX: 17 (25)<br>CON: 10<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 13<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 398<br>Skillpoints: 216<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 19/15/29<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Traps: +2<br>BAB: 29<br>AB (max, naked): 44 (melee), 37 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 25/30<br>Spell Casting: <br>Alignment Changes: 0<br><br>Discipline 43(50), Hide 40(47), Intimidate 4(3), Move Silently 40(47), Tumble 40(47), 22 left over<br><br>L01: F(1): Blind Fight, Dodge, Weapon Focus, Discipline(4)<br>L02: F(2): Expertise, Discipline(1)<br>L03: F(3): Mobility, Discipline(1)<br>L04: F(4): DEX+1, Weapon Specialization, (DEX=18), Discipline(1)<br>L05: F(5): Discipline(1)<br>L06: F(6): Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack, Discipline(1), Intimidate(4)<br>L07: WM(1): Weapon of Choice, Discipline(1)<br>L08: WM(2): STR+1, (STR=17), Discipline(1)<br>L09: WM(3): Power Attack, Discipline(1)<br>L10: WM(4): Discipline(1)<br>L11: WM(5): Discipline(1)<br>L12: WM(6): STR+1, Cleave, (STR=18), Discipline(1)<br>L13: WM(7): Discipline(1)<br>L14: WM(8): Discipline(1)<br>L15: WM(9): Knockdown, Discipline(1)<br>L16: WM(10): STR+1, (STR=19), Discipline(1)<br>L17: F(7): Discipline(1), Hide(10), Move Silently(8), Tumble(5)<br>L18: F(8): Improved Critical, Improved Knockdown, Discipline(1)<br>L19: F(9): Discipline(1)<br>L20: SD(1): DEX+1, <b>{Hide in Plain Sight}</b>, (DEX=19), Hide(2), Move Silently(3), Tumble(15)<br>L21: WM(11): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=20)<br>L22: SD(2): {Darkvision, Evasion, Uncanny Dodge I}, Hide(3), Move Silently(4), Tumble(5)<br>L23: WM(12): Discipline(3)<br>L24: WM(13): STR+1, Great Dexterity II, Epic Weapon Focus, (STR=20), (DEX=21), Discipline(1)<br>L25: F(10): <b>Epic Weapon Specialization</b>, Discipline(1)<br>L26: SD(3): Hide(7), Move Silently(8)<br>L27: SD(4): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=22), Hide(2), Move Silently(1), Tumble(5)<br>L28: SD(5): DEX+1, {Defensive Roll}, (DEX=23), Hide(4), Move Silently(4)<br>L29: SD(6): Hide(4), Move Silently(4)<br>L30: SD(7): Great Dexterity IV, {Slippery Mind}, (DEX=24), Hide(1), Move Silently(1)<br>L31: SD(8): Hide(1), Move Silently(1)<br>L32: SD(9): DEX+1, (DEX=25), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(5)<br>L33: SD(10): <b>Epic Dodge</b>, {Improved Evasion}, Hide(1), Move Silently(1)<br>L34: WM(14): Discipline(10)<br>L35: WM(15): Discipline(1)<br>L36: WM(16): STR+1, Great Strength I, Epic Prowess, (STR=22), Discipline(1)<br>L37: SD(11): Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Tumble(5)<br>L38: WM(17): Discipline(2)<br>L39: WM(18): Great Strength II, (STR=23), Discipline(1)<br>L40: WM(19): STR+1, Epic Toughness I, (STR=24), Discipline(1)<br><br><br>He ends up with decent AB, decent AC (plus ED), HiPS, and all the benefits of WM (extended crit range and multiplier, Ki damage, etc.). You can delay the last SD level to 39 or 40 if you want to max his Hide/MS skills. ED does come late, but you can't take it earlier without delaying EWF and EWS. Damage is still on the low side for a 2-handed weapon (+10 from Str with the 1.5x multiplier), but that's the price for getting ED. Still, with Ki damage, +10 from Str, and +6 from EWS, X3 crits with a 14-20 crit range, it's not too shabby. You could take Overwhelming Crit instead of Epic Toughness (drop one of the pre-epic feats for Great Cleave) for another 2d6 on crits.<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 05/09/08 03:07</span></i></p>

You could do the above build using Rogue instead of SD if you want to pick up UMD and skillpoints for search, traps, locks, etc. You lose HiPS. If you go Fighter 8/Rogue 13/WM 19 you keep the same final AB but lose the last skilldump (so either leave Tumble at 35 or don't get ED until level 39), or you can go Fighter 10/Rogue 14/WM 16 and lose one point of AB. You end up with a LOT more skillpoints (you can max Tumble and UMD, get Search, Set and Disarm traps all high enough for Deadly traps), but losing HiPS does hurt. You also pick up 7d6 of sneak damage, which doesn't suck....<br><br>If your environment has a lot of nice items that UMD would let you use (i.e. good Monk boots, robes, scrolls and wands, etc.), then the Rogue route is probably better. If it doesn't have a lot of good magic items that require UMD for this build, or if True Sight is rare (making HiPS even more powerful), then the SD version is probably better.<br><br>TM
