hehe I mostly play on Bastions of War - team PvP good vs. evil, though there's no alignment restrictions so u can play evil paladins or good blackguards, lvls 28-40...gold is related to XP with most character reaching their peak in terms of equipemt at around 2,000,000 XP <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif"> <br><br>It's basically all about the builds, the class-alignment de-restriction is so that u can play your build on either team <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">  when you're fighting PvP against higher more powerful characters u really need to make the most out of your build =&gt; improving your own builds...something like survuival of the fittest!!!<br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!

I take my Epic Characters to Field of Dreams (hehe,I don't know what it is under, I followed a friend there once). It's a heavy rp sever, but there is a great deal of fighting going on.

The problem with BoW is that there are so many changes to every spell and feat you cant just take any of your characters there, but rather make a modified version or get a tailormade new one. Its still not a bad server to play on, as noted, you have to get exactly the most out of your character to survive(longer than 30 sec).<br><br>I have played on BoW and got 2 level 40 chars there, but now i'm mostly playing on a low magic PW, 'origins'. But if you want to take your character to epic levels and dont enjoy RP, then 'origins' is the wrong place for you.

I play almost exclusively at The World of Greyhawk (link in sig), which is a nice little rendition of the old Greyhawk Campaign setting of yesteryear.  It is a place peopled with NPCs whose names are as common as household words:  Mordenkainer, Rary, Tenser, Lord Robilar, Rary, Vecna, Iuz the Old.  <br><br>It's a big world, and it's hard-hitting Action with a bit of RP.  Low to Mid Magic, +5 or +6 weapons max.  All classes/feats allowed, and has a Book of Summons (allows casters to choose Summons type), Libram of Necromancy (for customized Undead Summoning), and Rods of Fast Buffing.  Barbarians Terrifying Rage has been restored to make that class attractive, and some of the Epic Spell have been given some teeth.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

grizz, I have been looking over the information on the WoG server and it seems like something I might like to try out (if I ever get the time). Couple of things. 1. Does the Libram of Necromancy apply to just Clerics or to Wizards who specialize in the school or both? 2. I like the added "umph" to the Barbarian Terrifying Rage.

I play at the <b>Wheel of Time: Third Age</b> RP server.  It is a mid-magic world (+5 cap), with few restrictions on class choices, beyond Palemaster and Red Dragon Disciple requiring a certain evil status (and DM permission <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  ).  Also, certain ramifications for playing a caster class, or 'channeler', though they're still great fun.

I play on Chaotic World Legends for fun. It's mainly for getting rid of stress and just wacking some noobs. All in all it's great fun.<br><br>Other than that I play on a Danish server called Zantium. It is a roleplay server and it's is growing. The player base is pretty experienced roleplayers and at the moment the only DK server strong enough to compete with foreign servers. <br><br>I would recommend it to any Danish nwn player, because Great Danes stick together ^^

I play on the same servers as Winterhawk; Anchorome and Harvest Moon. <br><br>I want to add that Anchorome has hack'n slash areas for characters all the way up to lvl 40. But to become an epic character you have to qualify through roleplay so people know who the character is and what makes it epic.
