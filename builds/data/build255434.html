Slashing, Sneaking, Spreading Contagion, Torture and Fear PvM (1-40) and PvP<br><br>DARK PRINCE (“the Impaler”) – Version: Dev.Crit<br><br>Concept: The Dark Prince (Impaler), is based on Prince Vlad (or Dracula – meaning, the “son of the dragon,” as he was known in his own time); a despotic ruler of Romania, whose political and military career is steeped deep in blood and torture. His was a dark and dual nature, both cruel yet highly charismatic: Impaler was a prominent Christian crusader whose sheer will and audacity saved Romania from invading Turks, and his legacy the model upon which the factual “Dracula” of Bram Stoker undead vampire is based. <br><br>This highborn member of a Romanian Court is “prominent in European history – and more terrifying than his fictional descendant. While not the black-cloaked, centuries-old, bloodsucker of literary fame, the infamy of the historical figure outperforms that of Stoker's creation.” Explains the Crime Library of his despotic rule and his exploits: <br><br>“He ruled his military kingdom of Wallachia – southern Romania – with a heavy and blood-soaked fist. To not only the Turks, but also to many of his own countrymen, he was The Impaler. During his tenure, he killed by the droves, impaling on a forest of spikes around his castle thousands of subjects who he saw as either traitors, would-be traitors or enemies to the security of Romania and the Roman Catholic Church. Sometimes, he slew merely to show other possible insurgents and criminals just what their fate would be if they became troublesome. A pamphlet published in Germany immediately following his death tells of his burning beggars after allowing them free food at his court.” <br><br>At the same time, the Crime Library continues: “the adventurous life led by (the Impaler) put him in contact with the era's most fascinating people…and he witnessed the rising use of gunpowder as a means of destruction, the Holy Crusades, the fall of Constantinople and the nouveau philosophy of art, alchemy and culture that became known as the Renaissance; …[t]hough many Westerners are baffled that a man whose political and military career was as steeped in blood as was that of Vlad Dracula," writes Elizabeth Miller for Journal of the Dark magazine, "the fact remains that for many Romanians he is an icon of heroism...It is this duality that is part of his appeal:" see, <a href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/history/vlad/index_1.html" target="_blank">Click Here</a> <br> <br>Character: While not the first of his type in terms of the class-combination chosen, this character differs from others in terms of the level-split and also feats, in order to keep within the spirit of the real-life historical character upon whom the Dark Prince (Impaler) is based. <br><br>Strengths and Weaknesses: <br>Very Good AB and Damage, including the power of devastating critical, divine might, smite good and 12d6 sneak damage; hitpoints and AC are decent. Saving throws (particularly will) could definitely be better; however, saves are ‘savable’ thanks to crippling strike, BG Dark Blessing and UMD. In addition, has a nice assortment of skills, including stealth and UMD, enabling self-buffing of all stats and also offense and defence capabilities. <br><br>Without further adieu, please meet Dark Prince, the Impaler (Dev. Crit. Version); if you would prefer an Impaler without DevCrit, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "255432", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>   <br><br><br><br>The Dark Prince (“the Impaler”) –  Fighter(8), Rogue(10), Blackguard(22)<br>Race: Human / Alignment: Any Evil (Lawful Evil Preferred)<br><br>I.

Nice build, Deb. As per the non dev crit one, start Rogue and split Rogue 4/FTR 6 preepic for +1 Ref save.<br>I'd drop CS for IE in this build: with both SA and DevCrit CS is reeeally overkill and you'll benefit more from IE, given your lowish save.<br><br>If you wanna go the sneaky way, then drop two Great Str for ESF: Hide/MS. Otherwise, drop the skills and get some Set Trap, at least 1 rank in Disable Traps and Listen plus some more Spellcraft. You might want to consider dropping 2 Great Str all the same for epic save boosters or one save booster and ESF: Taunt, for example. <br><br>Welcome back Deb. Rock on.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 09/25/06 11:58:10 (GMT) by xitooner<br><br>I find its better to be flexible, THINK, and know your enemy.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Thanks, Kail (appreciate that); ah, and w. more skills and a save boost to make our latest bad boy even better you say .... hmm, sounds "evil" indeed -- how's this? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    <br><br>Skillpoints: 293<br>Disable Trap 1(5), Discipline 43(55), Heal 1(0), Hide 5(4), Listen 42(41), Open Lock 1(0), Set Trap 42(41), Spellcraft 18(20), Taunt 43(45), Tumble 40(39), UMD 38(40)<br><br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 26/17/20<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4, Traps: +1<br><br>NICE!! As we can see, with but a few tweaks as suggested, we drop stealth (yeah, yeah: as per our discussion on the non-dev crit version, over it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">     ) in favor of . . . SERIOUS TRAP SET SKILLS  …. (all so very deadly, incl. gas -- Yeah! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">      <br><br>Also, max’d out, as best we can (i.e.., a cross-skill) spellcraft (thus, +1 all saves vs. spells, which ain’t too shabby at all, nice call!); as if that’s not enough, brought in those listen skills (so, no sneaking up on this bad boy, esp. when all his other stats, incl. grt str, sneak dam &amp; dev crit etc. all remain the same; in fact, nothing at all changes, only more skills – Cool! <br><br>While I still believe there’s something to be said for starting ftr (i.e., HPs, armor &amp; martial prof. out of the gate, for e.g.), when it comes to a sneaker, you, GD and Xylo all make a good argument re: skills, as in, can’t get enough, notwithstanding the power of dev crit; (OK, ok, I see the “light” er, make that the “dark” -- <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">     <br><br>With that in mind, start w. rogue, followed immediately of course by ftr (it’s +1 reflex save –and- +13 skills, thus more spellcraft for +1 saves vs. spells (I know, just one level, just one; next is ftr and *boom* we’ve all our proficiencies proper folks; and yes, I tossed and turned over it, but, c’mon, they’re just plain right on this folks -- no pain, no gain, yes? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">     <br><br>The only real “pain” in this re-arrangement (i.e., rogue 1st and bumping up one more pre-ep (for the enhanced playability factor) is that dev.crit comes in a bit later, but only by one level (i.e., at level 32, which is still good); then again, we do enhance playability, and w. all those great trap and other skills, …well, that does more than compensate for it, I do so agree (nice call, Kail, and thanks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">     ) <br><br>As to CS vs. IE – hmmmm; dunno - they’re both good, for sure. While I really like CS (remember, takes away not just enemy str/dam but also their dev.crit dc, and which is akin thus to gaining more fort for free), but perhaps, on this one, it could as you and GD say be overkill, this is true…. . . choices, choices… <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">     (tells ya what, CS vs. IE, I puts it down as a choice for players to make – they’re both good, and you make great points; while we knows how much I like me insurance, when you stop to really think about it, IE is in fact a good form of insurance, too (thanks, guys, and great points!)<br><br>Either way, enjoy – Tyr (and so good to be back (thanks, once again) -- and remember folks, you’re evil, so when you dev.crit and/or sneak, make sure it hurts <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">     <br><br>...and now for those tweaks: <br>01: Rogue(1): toughness, power attack<br>02: Fighter(1): weapon focus: greatsword<br>03: Fighter(2): knockdown, cleave<br>04: Rogue(2): STR+1, {Evasion}, (STR=18)<br>05: Fighter(3)<br>06: Fighter(4): great cleave, weapon specialization: greatsword<br>07: Fighter(5)<br>08: Blackguard(1): STR+1, (STR=19)<br><br>20: Rogue(4): STR+1, (STR=22)<br>26: Rogue(5)<br>27: Blackguard(14): great strength III, (STR=26)<br>28: Blackguard(15): STR+1, (STR=27)<br>29: Blackguard(16): overwhelming critical: greatsword<br>30: Blackguard(17): great strength IV, (STR=28)<br>31: Blackguard(18)<br>32: Blackguard(19): STR+1, devastating critical: greatsword, (STR=29)<br>33: Rogue(6): great strength V, (STR=30)<br>34: Rogue(7)<br>35: Rogue(8)<br>36: Blackguard(20): STR+1, great strength VI, (STR=32)<br>37: Blackguard(21)<br>38: Rogue(9)<br>39: Rogue(10): great strength VII, crippling strike –OR-improved evasion **, (STR=33)<br>40: Blackguard(22): STR+1, epic prowess, (STR=34)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 10/18/06 02:47</span></i></p>
