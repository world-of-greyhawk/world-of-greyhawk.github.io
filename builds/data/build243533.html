Artemis Entreri (Based on the assassin from the R. A. Salvatore novels)<br><br>Originally, when I started this build, I was striving to be as literally accurate as I could be. When I was done, I was left with a substandard sneak attacker who was more intimidating then the threat of childhood belting from your parents (but for practically no reason). He was alright, (although he wasn’t playable until level 21) and he wasn’t terribly good at hitting things.<br><br>So in the end I made this guy instead, and am too uncaring to change his build name. He’s still Artemis to me. He’s still the same sort of character, but he’s much better at it, and is playable from much earlier on. Interestingly enough, this is my first stab at an assassin… no pun intended.<br><br>To be honest, I had a hard time finding a build like mine at all (aside from <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "215056", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Death becomes you </a> by Kaliban99).

What Finneous is suggesting, is that if you nail an opponent with a DA, he's going to be dead in spite of the Criticals.  The dualwielded sneak dice from 21 levels of Assassin are more than enough to do the job.<br><br>Now, that really isn't the greatest problem with this build.

Dex-builds doesn't really benefit from weaponmaster in the same way STR builds do (Just ask the darn dexers on my server that had a taste of my crits the other day, vs their lousy crits in the 40's), so I am really tempted to agree with the Dwarflord.

I think by the outstanding synergy, he means if you crit on a successful sneak (death) attack (without the paralysis effect firing), you'll do tremendous damage. I realize the sneak damage is not multiplied on a crit, but the sneak damage on top of the crit damge = ouch.

*Rubs temples trying desparately to remember Entreri's Stats* As I recall, Enteri was primarily a fighter/rogue with only one token assassin level.  You might have been better off dumping assassin for rogue, and still have stayed true to his character.  To be fair, when Artemis first appeared there was no assassin class.  Rogue would give you several advantages including: epic dodge, a ton of skillpoints and evasion.  <br><br>I might also drop the starting dex a bit (to 15?) and up con a bit (14?), maybe raise str to 14.  Don't forget artemis can take a pounding.

Well, making stats for book-characters is just plain impossible. Go with what you feel make him right. Artemis was an assassin extremely skilled in his trade. Neither he nor Drizzt wore armor, two high levels going at each other with DnD ruleset with that little defense would end the fight in a round or two. They fought for a long time without even connecting a blow.<br>When you make builds like these, give them your feel, R.A.Salvatore didn't exactly bother about thinking Artemis is a fighter6/Rogue8/assassin1. so make it as you please. I would go with fighter/Rogue/Assassin, with EWS in both weapons. <br><br>[/slighly offtopic]<br>As for IC, well, say what you want, it doesn't really increase damage all that much, even with enchanted weapons and a x3 modifier. Nice take on Entreri anyhow, he was quite fleshed out and an interesting villain.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

Um... this may sound completely ignorant, but what official stats? Where does one find these stats?<br><br>Also, I said that about parry because yet again in the books, they fight by getting into a rythm from which they can both predict strikes, and launch counter-attacks at any openings they find. Sounds a lot like parry to me...<br><br>It's nice to hear that parry is going to be scrapped from NWN 2, but I still like the idea of it.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Big Meph on 06/12/06 02:19</span></i></p>

The official stats are in the Forgotten Realms books.<br><br>However, these stats print them as CR 18 characters, when realistically they should be somewhere around CR 35, given the book descriptions, and built using many classes and feats from many different books (Drizzt can walk on snow without breaking it ... tell me that isn't monk levels). Of course, they don't want to build any non-mage with power approaching the epic mages in the books.<br><br>Realistically, since they're t3h 4w3s0m3 st0ry characters, they don't work very well with any form of D&amp;D stats.<br>_________________<br>CATS!
