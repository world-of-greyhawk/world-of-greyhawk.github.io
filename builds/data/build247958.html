<b>Playable Level 1-40... PvM build</b>  <br><br>It isn't anything particularly special, a fairly standard Fighter/Assassin/Shadowdancer.  It is a build that is not well represented in the guild, there are Grizzled Dwarflord's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "212244", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Assassin King</a> and Kaliban's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "212315", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Drow Slayer</a>.  GD's build is strength based and Kaliban's doesn't get epic dodge or evasion, hence I felt this build is post worthy.  It manages a fair AB while dual wielding a pretty good AC, epic dodge and the ability to cast improved invisibility which effectively duplicates SC 5.  Throw HiPs into the mix and 7D6 of sneak attack and one has a fairly effective build.  It should do best in mid to high magic settings, where it can abuse HiPS.  It will even do okay in PvP if true seeing has been nerfed.  <br><br>I'm posting the story separately.  It's dark, really darker than I would have liked (I have no idea what dark recess of my mind it came from). I was going to PM it to the mods first, but it was too big to message.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br>-Hide in Plain Sight.  An ability which is possibly cheaper than devastating critical.<br>-Epic Dodge.<br>-Good AB.  He has a 43 AB , 41 while dual wielding.  This is pretty good for a fighter/rogue, but it could be better.<br>-Pretty nice AC.  It could be better, but it should make for fairly hard to hit target.<br>-Improved Evasion and a high reflex save.  Always good to avoid damage from traps, spells and breath weapons.<br>-7D6 death attack.  With a 27 DC he won't get too much use out of the paralysis, but the sneak damage is nice.  Epic weapon Specialization also helps with damage.<br>-Improved Knockdown.<br>-Assassin Spells.  Improved Invisibility and Darkness are always useful.<br>-Maxed out UMD.  He can use scrolls, wands and equipment from other classes.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br>-Low Damage.  Without death attacks, he can't do much damage to his opponents.<br>-Low Fortitude and Will Saves.  The fortitude save is passable, and if he can get a bit of a boost from items he should be fine against death magic.  The will save is a problem.<br><br><b>Dark Vengence</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Elf<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Any Evil<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 12<br>DEX 18<br>CON 12 <br>INT 16<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>All 10 increase dexterity<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Assassin 14<br>Fighter 16<br>Shadowdancer 10<br><br><i>Level Distribution and Feats</i><br>Level 1: (Fighter 1): Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus (Short Sword)<br>Level 2: (Fighter 2): Knockdown<br>Level 3: (Fighter 3): Two-Weapon Fighting<br>Level 4: (Fighter 4): Weapon Specialization (Short Sword)<br>Level 5: (Fighter 5)<br>Level 6: (Fighter 6): Ambidexterity, Dodge<br>Level 7: (Fighter 7)<br>Level 8: (Fighter 8 ): Improved Knockdown<br>Level 9: (Fighter 9): Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>Level 10: (Fighter 10): Blind-Fight<br>Level 11: (Fighter 11)<br>Level 12: (Fighter 12): Mobility, Expertise<br>Level 13: (Fighter 13)<br>Level 14: (Assassin 1)<br>Level 15: (Shadowdancer 1): Toughness<br>Level 16: (Shadowdancer 2)<br>Level 17: (Assassin 2)<br>Level 18: (Assassin 3): Improved Critical (Short Sword)<br>Level 19: (Assassin 4)<br>Level 20: (Shadowdancer 3)<br>Level 21: (Fighter 14): Epic Weapon Focus (Short Sword), Epic Weapon Specialization (Short Sword)<br>Level 22: (Assassin 5)<br>Level 23: (Assassin 6)<br>Level 24: (Assassin 7): Epic Prowess<br>Level 25: (Shadowdancer 4)<br>Level 26: (Shadowdancer 5)<br>Level 27: (Shadowdancer 6): Epic Fortitude<br>Level 28: (Shadowdancer 7)<br>Level 29: (Shadowdancer 8 )<br>Level 30: (Fighter 15): Great Dexterity I<br>Level 31: (Shadowdancer 9)<br>Level 32: (Shadowdancer 10)<br>Level 33: (Assassin 8 ): Epic Dodge<br>Level 34: (Assassin 9)<br>Level 35: (Assassin 10)<br>Level 36: (Assassin 11): Great Dexterity II<br>Level 37: (Assassin 12)<br>Level 38: (Assassin 13)<br>Level 39: (Assassin 14): Great Dexterity III, Great Dexterity IV<br>Level 40: (Fighter 16): Armor Skin<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 12<br>DEX 32<br>CON 12 <br>INT 16<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>AB and Damage</i><br>(no buffs, mundane short sword)<br>43/38/33/28 7+1D6 (17-20 x2) +7D6 Death Attack<br>Death Attack DC 27<br><br>(no buffs, two mundane short swords)<br>41/36/31/26 7+1D6 (17-20 x2) +7D6 Death Attack<br>41/36 6+1D6 (17-20 x2) +7D6 Death Attack<br>Death Attack DC 27<br><br>(+12 to Dexterity, haste, +5 keen short sword)<br>54/49/44/39/54 12+1D6 (15-20 x2) +7D6 Death Attack<br>Death Attack DC 27<br><br>(+12 to Dexterity, haste, two +5 keen short swords)<br>52/47/42/37/52 12+1D6 (15-20 x2) +7D6 Death Attack<br>52/47 11+1D6 (15-20 x2) +7D6 Death Attack<br>Death Attack DC 27<br><br>Maximum AB: 69 (67 while dual wielding)<br><br><i>AC</i><br>32 (no buffs, no equipment)<br>35 (no buffs, tower shield)<br>57 (+12 to Dexterity, +5 Robes, +5 Ring of Protection, +5 Amulet of Natural Armor, Boots of speed)<br>62 (+12 to Dexterity, +5 Robes, +5 Ring of Protection, +5 Amulet of Natural Armor, +5 Boots of the Sun Soul, Haste from alternate source)<br>67 (As above in expertise mode)<br>65 (+12 to Dexterity, +5 Robes, +5 Tower Shield, +5 Ring of Protection, +5 Amulet of Natural Armor, Boots of Speed)<br>70 (+12 to Dexterity, +5 Robes, +5 Tower Shield, +5 Ring of Protection, +5 Amulet of Natural Armor, +5 Boots of the Sun Sould, Haste from alternate source)<br>75 (As above in expertise mode)<br><br><i>Final Saves (Vs.

Xyral marvelled at the light and shadow that played upon the ruin around her.  She had seen the flicker of flames before, but never had she dreamed of how the beams of moonlight danced as it filtered through black smoke.  Her eyes stung, both from the unaccustomed light and from the acrid smoke but she couldn't look away.  The elven settlement was in ruin, the delicate wooden architecture that her surface cousins favoured were broken and in flame; Just like their bodies.  She smiled as the light washed over the face of a fallen cleric, locked in the perfect mask of horror it had assumed as his doom fell upon him.  As the burning in her eyes intensified, she closed them, focusing instead on baleful howl of the wind, accented by the roaring flames and percussive pops as the heat split the wood apart.  Lost as she was in the concerto of death, she almost didn't hear the sound of her troops returning.  There were twelve of them, all males, all warriors and all laden with sacks filled with loot.  They all had wounds, their long white hair was streaked and matted with blood and sweat, and their armour showed the marks of battle.  She had done all she could to heal them, but the gifts of Lolth did not stretch far enough to alleviate all of their wounds.  The loss of the other priestesses and mages was the one thing that marred this glorious victory.  <br><br>With fifty troops they had slaughtered a settlement ten times their number total and nearly twice their number in troops.  Yet they had the element of surprise, and more than half the warriors of the settlement were asleep when they attacked, so the loss of more than half their number including all of the mages and the priestesses, other than herself, was surprising.  Still, a victory like this would bring great honour to her and increase her station within house Di'Mihrr.  She wished that she only had Lolth to thank for this victory, but another had opened the gates to the settlement and hastened their ingress, a surface elf no less.  He had stayed out of the battle and said that he would return once the battle was over for payment.  She motioned to her remaining men to take their positions.  Half of them cocked their crossbows and took up positions amongst the devastation, masked from sight by the darkness and debris.  The remaining men drew their blades and headed into the ruined building behind the priestess.  She would see that the surface elf was properly rewarded for his efforts.  A cruel smile crossed her lips as she thought of how he would beg for his life as she sacrificed him to her dark goddess.  She looked back at the building which the surface elf had chosen for their meeting, a temple of Correllon.  It seemed the surface elf had a twisted sense of humour about him.<br><br>The time past slowly as she waited for the elf to approach, the thrill of the slaughter was passing and smell of the corpses was beginning to rise mixing with smoke.  She felt like she might wretch, but just then she saw a dark cloaked figure moving cautiously through the rubble towards her.  As it moved past a fire, she could make out the form better.  It was dressed entirely in black, from the leather boots to the heavy woollen cloak draped over its shoulders.  It didn't wear any armour, other than a pair of black metal bracers which dully reflected the orange glow of the flame. Its black clothing was simple yet elegant; it was tied close about the joints but otherwise flowed loosely over the figure, obscuring its shape and sex.  A few pouches hung from a wide belt about its waist, but there were no visible weapons.  The only relief from the darkness its accoutrement was its face, which shone like silver.  It wasn't a helmet, she could see the figure's black hair blowing in the wind behind it, it had to be a mask.  As the figure moved out of the light of the fire it seemed to vanish until it reappeared bathed in the light of another fire a few feet away from her.  She instinctively recoiled, it had covered the distance quicker than she had expected and she didn't hear any noise as it approached.  It paused a few feet infront of her, folding its arms in front of its chest.  She looked again upon its mask; it was made of silver and expertly crafted to resemble a humanoid face, with golden tear drops streaming from one eye.  There was a magic to it as well, it fit too well around the eyes, and the mouth of the mask though locked in a frown, seemed to be bonded to the figure's lips and moved with its mouth.  It was like a silver skin, more than a mask.  It had intrigued her the first time they had met and made no less an impression on this encounter.  This was the elf who had let them into the settlement, the traitor to his own people.  <br><br>"You've had your massacre, as I promised. Now I will take my gold as was agreed upon." He spoke flatly.  His voice had the melodic quality she had come to expect from a moon elf, but there was no trace of emotion.  No regret, no anger, no joy, just a plain statement.  Xyral manoeuvred to put him between her and the entrance to the temple, brushing her arm gently over his shoulder as she passed.  His muscles tensed almost imperceptibly before they relaxed.  Placing her hands on his lean and wiry shoulders, she began to massage them.  She could feel the tips of scabbards hidden from view beneath the cloak but she pretended to pay them no heed.  "Surely, there is no need to rush." She whispered gently leaning in close to his ear.  "There are still many hours to daybreak..."  The dropped his shoulders slightly and stepped forward out of her grasp in a swift, yet smooth an inoffensive motion.  "I have no love for Drow women.  Let us conclude our business and be done with it."  He said, in his almost hypnotic emotionless drawl, continuing to back her.<br><br>"Very well," laughed the Drow, "receive your reward."  As she spoke, her men burst from the ruined temple to seize the figure.  She expected her bowmen to fire their paralytic darts at the figure, but only the men in the temple charged forth.  The figure kicked out at the leading Drow warrior, tucking into ball and rolling backwards.  The blow missed, but it caused the warrior to pause, creating space as he tumbled backwards.  As he spun past Xyral, he stabbed out at the priestess with something clenched in his fist.  She winced slightly; the pain was sharp but faded swiftly.  She pivoted on her wounded leg continuing to track the figure.  The figure came up from his roll, drawing the pair of short swords he had concealed behind his back.   As her men rushed to face him, the shadows that surrounded him seemed to grow and descend upon him, like serpents falling on a mouse.  As they faded he was gone.<br><br>Xyral took a step forward and collapsed, her leg wouldn’t support her weight.  Looking down, she saw six Drow darts, tipped with paralytic poison buried in her thigh.   She had already exhausted her prayers, and the poison was already circulating through her system.  As she tried to prop herself up against the base of a ruined column that once flanked the entrance of the temple, she called to her men to defend her. She heard a shriek from behind her then heard a body drop.  Metal grinding against metal; it was one of her men.  She heard them rushing towards their fallen comrade then stop.  As she propped herself up, she looked towards her men.<br><br>They were scattered, looking for the elven assassin.  Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a shadow flit by one them.  There was a flash of silver, then the warrior fell to his knees gasping frantically as he tried to stop the geyser of blood that had erupted from his neck.  The other warriors turned in his direction, but the assassin had already chosen another target.  He charged straight at the nearest Drow, who turned just in time to see one of the swords thrust into his eye.  As the elf withdrew his blade, letting the dead warrior drop to the ground, another warrior closed the distance between them and swung his long sword at the assassin’s neck. The assassin ducked under swing, sweeping out his leg as he turned to face his assailant in one fluid motion.   His blade darted out like a striking cobra, slashing the tendons at the back of the Drow’s knee.  As the Drow fell back, the assassin darted forward driving his other blade under the arm of the falling warrior and into his heart.  The elf spun away from dying opponent, as he spun the shadows about him seemed to coil around him like a whirlwind of darkness.  As the shadows faded, the assassin had vanished again. <br><br>Xyral’s two remaining soldiers stood back to back, searching the shadows for any signs of movement.   As they turned, slowly circling, a figure darted from the shadows towards the Drow.  One of the soldiers swung his sword at the figure.   The blade connected, driving the figure to the ground. As the second Drow moved to join its comrade in its assault, Xyral saw the assassin emerge from the rubble behind the two Drow.  She wanted to scream, but with the poison coursing through her veins she could scarcely breathe.  The assassin drove a short sword through the base of the skull of one of the warriors, killing him instantly as the blade pierced his cerebellum.  The last Drow bolted upright, stopping its assault on the prostrate form as his comrade fell dead.  He stepped back, raising his sword as he turned to face the assassin.  The assassin circled, thrusting his blades at the warrior who was hard pressed to defend against the numerous strikes.  Suddenly the assassin stepped back, relenting from his assault.  As the Drow assumed a aggressive stance, the prostrate form rose from the ground, raking an ethereal claw across the warrior’s face.  As the Drow reeled, turning to face the second assailant, the assassin moved in driving his blades under the warrior’s breastplate and into his liver.  As he shrieked in pain, the shadow’s claws raked his face again.  The assassin thrust his second sword under the jupon of the warrior drawing another scream of agony from the warrior who dropped his weapon.  Xyral wanted to close her eyes as the shadow and its master continued their assault on the helpless warrior, but the poison had halted all conscious control she had over her body.<br><br>Xyral watched the Assassin turn from the dead warriors and squat a few feet in front of her, planting his bloody swords in the ground. “You Drow are so predictable,” laughed the assassin, “do you think I didn’t expect a double cross.  Even if I hadn’t seen you order your men to ambush you, it is your nature, Isn’t it?”  He looked into her eyes, cocking his head slightly to the side, his silver mask adopting an odd grin, despite the frown etched into its features.  “Oh, don’t answer on my account.   You see, I never did this for the money, It was all about you.”  He withdrew a dagger from his boot, dangling it by its hilt before her.  The blade itself was a straight and simple double edged design, but the hilt was bound in rope and seemed to merge with the steel cross guard, which fanned out like the nine fangs.  Set within each fang was diamond, six of them glowed with an inner light.   <br><br>As he rose, heading to the nearest fire to heat the blade, he continued, “Your group was too large for even one with my skills to assault.  So I offered you this settlement, I knew the battle would exhaust your magic, and during the chaos I killed your mages and the other priestesses.  I didn’t capture you after the battle because, while all I needed was you, I would have still liked the gold.  You don’t have any do you?”  He returned, straddling the helpless Drow he opened her mouth and grabbed her tongue with his leather clad thumb and forefinger.  “Still tight lipped?  Let’s see what we can do about that.” He said as he slid the blade under her tongue.  It didn’t hurt, the poison that paralyzed her also numbed her.  She could smell the burning flesh as the blade cut through the tissue, and taste the blood that flowed from the wound.  Then she tasted nothing, the assassin went to work stopping the bleeding, but the hot blade had done most of the work.  When he had finished, he raised her tongue before her, slapping her across the face with it before he threw it into the fire.  “You won’t be saying anything now.  You need to know why this is happening to you.  The best way for you to understand is to see.”  <br><br>He reached up and pulled the mask from his face, there were no straps holding it in place and it came away easily, it’s fluid surface solidifying into a plain steel mask.  As he lowered it from before his face, what she saw horrified the priestess.  From the nose up, his face was covered with a network of scars and burns, some of them so deep they must have been close to the bone.  Below the nose, his skin was flawless and smooth.   He looked like he might have been handsome once.   As he put down the mask, he thrust his face within a few inches of the Drow.  “Let my hideous disfigurement be the last sight your eyes behold.”  He shouted.  With this, he forced her eyes open and drove the dagger into them.  The fluid smelled foul as it rolled down her cheek and she could hear him working on removing her damaged eyeballs from their orbits.<br><br>Regaining his composure he spoke again, “ I know what you have suffered is terrible, and what will follow will be worse, but you must listen now.  Once I explain this, the path to your release will be clear.  I was once a great warrior of the elven nation, as renowned for my prowess as I was for striking appearance.  I was envied by men and sought after by women.  All that ended, when I was captured by your people.  A priestess, just like you, felt the best way to torture me was to destroy my face.  Over nine days I endured flame, acid and blades, while she covered my entire face with scars.  It was excruciating, she damaged the nerves so that I would always feel the pain of the wounds an she was very careful to leave me my sight, so that I could gaze upon my countenance are remember what was lost.  If you think I am hideous now, you should have seen me then."<br><br>"I eventually escaped their clutches and made it to the surface.  I returned to my people, but none could stand to look at me.  The priests told me that because the wounds had healed, they could not undo the damage and I should pray to the Gods for a miracle.  My entreaties to the Gods went unanswered and in time I left, I could not stand the hushed whispers and averted eyes when I passed."<br><br>"I travelled to human lands and it was there I found compassion.  First from the priests of Ilmater, who removed my pain.  They told me if I could release my anger they could restore my face, but it was not something I could do.  In the Underdark it was all that sustained me; it had become a part of me; it was my strength. I thanked the priests and left.  I found that my martial skills were useful in human cities and I served as a mercenary.  The anger and constant violence changed me, and in time any job would do.  I became an assassin, and I came to the attention of the priests of Mask.  For a vow of fealty, they gave me my mask, and made me an offer.  If I killed a faithless priest for each day I was tortured, I would have the scars removed."<br><br>"It would have been simple to find nine faithless priests, but after what I endured that would not do.  I decided to capture nine priestesses of Lolth and break their faith.  You will be my seventh priestess.  Know that only when you have renounced your faith, will I grant you death.  This dagger that I use on you now will tell me when that time has come.  If you remember nothing else in the time ahead of us, remember this: all you have to do to end your suffering is to renounce Lolth.  That is all you need to hear."  With that the assassin drove the dagger into Xyral's ears.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Nice build. The story was good, too. Very impressive <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>This guy could get SC4 without too much trouble. I think it would be a good choice, the Assassin's II is only once per day and easily dispelled off of this guy. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  You could move the Ftr14 bonus feat to epic, drop Great Fortitude and you can get Epic Fortitude in epic or some other feat.<br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a>

I think they are a little expensive.  I've made them in the past, but for build where II will pretty much be the builds only spell buff, I'd rather risk dispelling than spend four feats.  I do have a couple of ED/SCV builds, but I prefer to use rogue for them rather than assassin.  They seem to come out better that way.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>You could move the Ftr14 bonus feat to epic, drop Great Fortitude and you can get Epic Fortitude in epic or some other feat.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>That is an excellent suggestion.  If you drop the 14th fighter level and take assassin there intead, adding another shadowdancer level pre-epic, you could take the fighter level at 21 and grab both epic weapon focus and epic weapon specialization.  Then you could take epic fortitude at 24 and end up with +2 to fortitude and +1 to will.  I'll rework it and PM you the changes.  Thanks again, you rock.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Nice build Mith, and a helluva story. Dark indeed, but well done. That change suggested by Finn is top notch too. Good work!<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...

*low whistle*  that was one heckuva story Mith.<br><br><br>oh, and the build is pretty good.  I wouldn't worry overly about the length of time that II will last.  With UMD you stand a good chance in most environments of finding at least a few II scrolls.<br><br>nicely done, as usual.<br><br>-cs
