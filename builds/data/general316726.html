so whats gonna happen to all the builds listed here? is anyone gonna back them up or is it just a matter of "if you want the builds you back them up"?<br>_________________<br>Where we belong, there's no one to hurt.

I am not sure if anyone remembers, and i am trying to get a hold of Anuis, but the first builds on the guild were from billbo, or something like that.  He didnt create the builds, but he somehow transfered them.  <br><br>I will miss you guys alot.

I need one of you to be responsible for contacting the others once it's done (which means having the index updated and saved in your computer).

Taken altogether, I can't imagine these posts take that many gigs of space.  I'm sure the space could be found.  I'd be happy to come up w/ a hundred gigs, if I thought it would be helpful, and I'm one of the fairly-techless, with mediocre hardware.  I'm sure there's someone here with tetra-bytes available.  The issue is getting the information.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;We're running out of time...</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->And how.  The issue is that it still seems like cutting and pasting is the best available option.  That's a lot of cutting and pasting.  Perhaps, if we had more time, we could divy up the builds between those that are willing, but time, at this juncture, is extremely limited.  What makes it yet more difficult is that we don't really know how limited it is.<br><br>I'll admit, I am currently far from optimistic.  This sucks.  This seriously sucks.  I keep hoping someone will come up with a solution, but as of yet, no such luck, and come Monday, every day will dawn with the fear that there is no more ECB, and all has been lost.  Major, major suckage.

I will take time this weekend to try to find somewhere to host all this information. There is a social website called Orkut that we normally use here in Brazil, which is kind of like a Myspace or Facebook. There you can create a COMMUNITY, which is similar to a guild and post all the stuff. I was trying to find a better way, since the forum tools are really limited there, but so far I haven't been able to. Even if it is temporary, it'll allow for the ECB to continue to exist and give us time to try to find a new "home planet".<br><br>You don't need to worry about my builds, since I have all of them here in my own personal backup. I think that all active builders should do the same. That would save A LOT OF TIME. Also, if I may suggest, I wouldn't bother with the builds that are no longer legal. Cool as they may be, awesome as they may be, they can no longer be done, so there's no reason to keep them around (and that would also leave a lot of room for people to post new build wherever this forum migrates to).<br><br>I'll be in touch with you this weekend for sure, when and if I come up with a better way. Don't worry, you're not alone in this! Long live the ECB!! <br><br>Take it EZ!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Maximillian Kane on 07/17/10 10:57</span></i></p>

Thanks so much for taking the time to save all those builds!<br><br>I know it's a lot of work and I really appreciate you taking the time to do that.  Have enjoyed so muchly looking through all the builds and the commentary about them.  Have used some of them in PW's over the years.<br><br>Sad to see both this guild and the forums go bye-bye.  Like a lot of you, I haven't been on here and active as I have been in the past.  I still play NWN though -- just not as much online as I used to.<br><br>Thanks again to everyone for making this place so great.  Hate to see it go, but I guess "all good things.."<br><br>Carry on folks,<br><br>Joe

Update: I will save the PrC after all... I thought there were more than ten pages worth... but when I went to check.. only 2... which is pitiful... I had hoped that there would have been more than that. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  It's unfortunate that no one has bothered to try using PRC stuff.
