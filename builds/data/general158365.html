It will be "Free For All" but in categories according to weapon class they are in, such as archers, close-range weapons, etc etc. Although there will be few exceptions!

Do you mean a training module or a duelling module?<br><br>Perhaps you could tell a little more about what the general idea is? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

But it would not be official unless it is part of the monthly tournaments, and all of categories, such as magics vs magics, melee vs melee, melee vs magics, and so on...

I'm no module builder, so I don't know what exactly is possible and what is not, but I'll put down some ideas <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>1)<br>- An large arena, Colosseum like, where spectators can watch a duel form a stand. This area would be for PvP, with rules on which both players agreed (perhaps with mundane armor only). Here you should be able to do party vs party too (guilds against eachother? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> ). It should be large enough to run around, so all different tactics can be used (combat in small areas limits archers and casters).<br>- Some smaller areas to test specific skills on dummys, chests etc, and maybe monsters. You could have objects with increasing difficulty (e.g. dummies with AC 15, 20, 25...50,60 etc)<br><br>2)<br>I think it should be as close to the Bioware version as possible, everyone has that version (or should be able to use it).<br><br>3) <br>Depends on what kind of different challenges you want to have.<br><br>9) Yes would be nice, but perhaps you could do it by announcement too, so when there are 2 or more contestants, a date can picked and announced. I think there will be times when there's noone available for duels and other times where there are more then you can handle on one monthly tournament. Besides not everyone is available at one certain date.

That is doable.<br><br>Anyone else have any suggestions to add?

I've been using the Halls of Advanced Training HOTU version and that works fine for testing builds. I've never used the PvP side it of it, only single player. I imagine it wouldn't be hard to make something based on that and add more PvP maps.

It is not challenging enough for certain builds. So the module that I am trying to work on will, I do mean will, test every aspects of the build. <br><br>Heck, I might even throw in the competition for that.<br><br>What I mean by that is that if, for example, your character is a rogue. You enter a halls that is full of traps and each segments of the hall which will be split by the doors. Every segments will have traps that increases farther you go, and it will be named for levels. Such as, if you reach level 5, you disarm it, then you die in level 6. In other area, there will be a bulletin board that says that you got far as level 6 but did not complete it. So that means the next person will have to try beat that, if that person reaches 7th, then that will be the top record.<br><br>It might be something like this...<br><br>Bill the Rogue: Level 7 completed, died at level 8.<br>Ralph the Stupid: Level 6 completed, resigned at level 7.<br><br>and so on.<br><br>Also, I am thinking about putting in extras in the segments, if you disarms the treasure, you would get something in return. And might have some hidden treasures in same area. If you can detect it, you would recieve a item that will boost your disarming skills.<br><br>Same would be done for other type of characters. Such as whoever got the most kills, one who got killed the most, etc etc.<br><br>All of this is just a idea.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.

I don't know if it's possible, but perhaps things like:<br>- most damage: on 1 dummy, all types of builds can compete<br><br>- quickest kill: one monster with lots of HP, again all types of builds, dev crit allowed, but should be very difficult.<br><br><br>Also will it be only for level 40 characters or will challenges be scaled to level (e.g. most damage level 15-20 or something like that...)?

I do in fact have something that should present a challenge to all characters: melee, caster or archer based; I don't want to give out too much because if I tell you what the NPC does, it will give you a idea of how to beat it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  All I can say, it will be hard to beat.

You would have to be real prepared in order to defeat it. It requires stragety I suppose.
