I think I started using it around a year ago? maybe two not really sure anymore and yes I did look those over they showed their age so I figured I'ld put up something a bit newer up, that and 2 of them are Charisma based the other is part strength part con this is full str same classes different purposes imo I can get someone to remove it if needed<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Revenant Mattlov on 02/26/09 04:58</span></i></p>

Unless you just do the in and out 1v1 PvP (which is quite boring, IMO), then this is a much better build than the other 15/15/10 split. It manages that and in addition has LI and buffs that are immune to greater dispel. With CHA gear and spells, your saves and Divine shield is quite okay. <br><br>What spells/combat tactics do you prefer?

A much better build although some feat rearranging is in order.  Curse song at level 40?  Come on..<br><br>PS: if you're not going for Devastating Critical, you kinda need to have Divine Might since you'll have to rely on damage to kill your opponents, not on them rolling a 1.  And in any case, there's no reason here NOT to have it since you have plenty of free feats.<br><br>Also if you do BG 4 pre-epic, you can get Lasting Inspiration at level 24.  This along with level 20 bard buffs will make your life much easier than having 10 RDD levels, since you now effectively have +7 AC (+5 song, -2 ab from curse) and +7 AB (+2 song, -5 AC curse).<br><br>Actually, while we're here, here's how I usually do it.<br><br>01: Bard(1): Power Attack, Cleave<br>02: Bard(2)<br>03: Bard(3): Curse Song<br>04: Bard(4): STR+1<br>05: Bard(5)<br>06: Bard(6): Extend Spell<br>07: Bard(7)<br>08: Bard(8): STR+1<br>09: Blackguard(1): Weapon Focus<br>10: Blackguard(2):<br>11: Blackguard(3)<br>12: Blackguard(4): STR+1, Divine Shield<br>13: Bard(9)<br>14: Bard(10)<br>15: Bard(11): Improved Critical<br>16: Bard(12): STR +1<br>17: Bard(13)<br>18: Bard(14): Blindfight<br>19: Bard(15)<br>20: Bard(16): STR +1<br>21: Bard(17): Epic Weapon Focus<br>22: Bard(18)<br>23: Bard(19)<br>24: Bard(20): STR+1, Lasting Inspiration<br>25: RDD(1)<br>26: RDD(2)<br>27: RDD(3): Greater Cleave<br>28: RDD(4): STR +1<br>29: RDD(5)<br>30: RDD(6): Overwhelming Critical<br>31: RDD(7)<br>32: RDD(8): STR +1<br>33: RDD(9): Devastating Critical<br>34: RDD(10)<br>35: Bard(21)<br>36: Bard(22): STR+1, Armor Skin<br>37: Bard(23): Bard bonus feat, ESF: something<br>38: Bard(24)<br>39: Bard(25): Epic Prowess or Epic Fort<br>40: Bard(26): STR+1, Bard bonus feat, ESF: something<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bertuzzi on 02/26/09 08:08</span></i></p>

Level arrangement is use preference I give a basic outline you can level it however you want, the server I was on when I played this build fire resist was mandatory by 24 if you wanted to solo without spending money on heal kits constantly so..as I said level it however you want to make it easiest for whatever server you might be playing on, and you'll have to point out some free feats I don't see much in the way of em less you're talking about the great strengths though I suppose you could take curse at level 1 toughness at 39 and use the bonus bard feat for a ESF if you wanted or just not bother with toughness at all if you can get a decent amount of +con from gear<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Revenant Mattlov on 02/26/09 08:14</span></i></p>

Tactics? I'll start by saying I usually used a slightly different version 12 con instead of 14, 12 int instead of 10 with 43 Taunt epic skill focus taunt. As with any bard always make sure you have a curse song going, prevents you from being hit by someone elses curse song which needless to say is a huge advantage also curse song is dispellable take advantage of this use a grtr dispell against another bard hit him with a curse song right after chances are you'll probably land it, follow it up with a taunt or knockdown. when using your taunt I'ld suggest not using it normally instead use it cancel action it then use it again it'll make the check instantly with less time being flat footed. UV, Darkness &amp; greater dispell are your friends abuse em for all they're worth. if you happen to fight a bard/rdd/cot or a pally/sorc/rdd straight up use all the above and run around like a sissy you're not surviving it if he's fully buffed and you're fighting fair you don't do enough damage and they have too much AB <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

A Bard/BG/RDD without Divine Might?  I would drop Improved Crit for that.  You can go with Keen and a high threat range slashing weapon if you need to keep your criticals up.  I would also start with a 16 Strength and free up those 6 points for Charisma and Intelligence.  In a build such as this, more Charisma synergizes across the board, especially when Divine Might is involved.  I'd seriously think about pumping that up a bit (to 20-22).<br><br>That said, I believe the quintessential version of a Bard/BG/RDD is the Banshee build linked in Avado's post.  <br><br>And that's not to say there's anything wrong with this build, because there's not, and it should be remarkably successful in most environments.  People may nitpick you here and there, but it seems to me that you have a firm grasp on what you're doing, and I expect future builds will improve immensely.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

This was intended to be more of a long lasting melee orientated build hence the higher strength and lower charisma then the banshee build and as for Divine Might at one point I did have it in this build just rarely used it as I never got a chance to rest so had to save turn undead uses for shield lol, but if anyone wants divine might they can fit it in somewhere just take the 4th BG level at 15 or 18 if using a Scimitar or Kukri crits will still be plentiful as long as you cast keen edge on it (also saves a spot on your weapon if you're on a server with a forge system same with +5 EB)

Nah the 15/15/10 is far from godly but..get some practice with him you'll earn a nice reputation in duels then people start runnin from ya or not fightin ya lol and for the most part 26 Bard is a great stopping point for a melee bard great song full access to spells through still spell 2 bonus feats you can use for lasting/epic skill focuses.<br>Also someone mentioned taking RDD later and more bard earlier there was another reason for gettin 10 RDD by lvl 22 you miss out on skill points from the +2 int at RDD 10 by taking it later, not really that big a deal but I hate not squeezing every ounce out of my builds lol<br><br>P.S If anyone wants I can also put up a 38/1/1 Bard <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">
