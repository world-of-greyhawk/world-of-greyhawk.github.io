I've started playing with this build, and it's a good deal of fun, but I did notice a few small innacuracies (and I have a few questions):<br><br>You can't take "Maximize Spell" at 6th lvl, but you can take "Empower Spell", then you can take "Maximize" at lvl 9.<br><br>You can't take "Divine Shield" at lvl 15.  I couldn't find this in the feat's description, but apparently Power Attack is a prerequisite.  If you think this feat is crucial, you could substitute power attack for Expertise (or humans could take it instead of Improved Expertise).<br><br>And I was wondering: why not add extend spell?  This is nice for things like Haste (in worlds that have out-lawed boots of haste).  But perhaps it's not generally that helpful.

I did my best to recall the feats that I took at the levels I took them, and then eliminated the ones that proved mostly useless, substituted ones that I thought would work better.  Your suggestions are good ones, particularly for the off-oc world (extend spell).  <br><br>Thanks for the comments.<br>_________________<br>We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender - Winston Churchill
