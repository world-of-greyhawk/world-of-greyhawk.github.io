<b>Playable 1-40 in PvE</b> - Low-magic worlds preferred.  Not PvP-recommended.<br><br>This is one of several experiments I've been toying with regarding shifters.  In this case he's a Con-based shifter with Terrifying Rage.

Adds +3 AB to drow form and +120 hp to all forms.<br><br>FAQ:<br><b>Q:  This build is certainly unique, but I think maybe it's unique for a reason - does it really work?</b><br>A:  I wouldn't be posting it if I didn't have at least moderate success testing it in combat.  It's not the most powerful shifter build possible, obviously (no dragon), but you do make one heckuva tank in several of your forms and you can deal out at least average melee offense in whichever of the epic humanoid shapes you pick to focus on.<br><br>Gargoyle, Manticore, Drider, and Risen Lord can be very tough as damage sponges with your high hitpoints and their innate DR.<br><br><b>Q: Why do you recommend drow warrior shape for this build's specialty?</b><br>A:  Since it's a non-monk shifter, it pays to specialize in one of the armed forms that wouldn't get an unarmed attack progression.  Since I'm not raising wisdom, Azer Chieftain is out - and he's not a very powerful shape anyway.  The Rakshasa, of course, would rely on spells for offense and not melee.<br><br>This narrows down my options to Minotaur (Axe), Drider (Spear), Whipmaster (Whip), Kobold (Shortsword), Drow (Longsword) and Risen Lord (Scythe).  Minotaur was eliminated right away because he lacks the special powers and innates of the other shapes, and because he overrides constitution with a lower value than I have already.  Drider has some attractive properties and innates, but also overrides con with a lower value and isn't anything to write home about in the AC department either.  The risen lord has great innate properties, but generally can never get much of an AB and also overrides con.<br><br>That puts the focus squarely on the three epic humanoids, and really any of them will work for this build.  But the kobold is a finesser, so your rage strength bonus won't improve his AB, while the lizardman needs you to change a feat to exotic proficiency to get a focus in whip, and he only gets a +5 weapon while the other two get +6.  That's how I ended up with drow.  I think kobold would do well too though - you'll be able to get a few free rounds of sneak attacks on enemies that fail their save vs your rage. <br><br><b>Q:  Doesn't terrifying rage come extremely late in the build though?</b><br>A:  Yes it does, but I had to front-load the shifter levels to make the build more playable.  It's hard to claim a build like this as being playable if the shape it specializes in isn't achieved as soon as practical.  So, in order to get the epic humanoid shape before level 30 I had to put terrifying rage (and the bulk of the barbarian levels) on the back burner.<br><br>You can get some very juicy additional AB out of the build if you build it as a straight 40, with a 16/4 barb/druid split preepic.<br><br><b>Q:  What other tactics and tricks can this build use?</b><br>A:  The drow and drider forms get Darkness as an innate spell, and you get Ultravision as a druid spell.  This lets you layer an extra level of defense by inflicting attacker miss chances on your opponent while you can still see.<br><br>By shifting into a form with an innate attack, like wyrmling breath or manticore spikes, and running improved expertise, you can use the innate power as offense while increasing your AC by 10.  This is a good tactic to use if you come across enemies with weak saves, or that you are finding too hard to fight in melee.  <br><br>Terrifying rage can become a <i>defensive</i> feat in some forms - anything that gets close enough to melee you will be paralyzed long enough for you to take a shot at it and then retreat... when it comes back into range, it'll get paralyzed again... etc.  So you can "paralysis kite" with terr rage.  This may be especially attractive and effective if you decide to go the kobold route instead of the drow route, since you'll keep getting sneak attacks.<br><br>Your saves are mediocre, but many of your forms cover for them - the drow gets improved evasion and SR 30, for example, while other shapes are just immune to various kinds of spells.<br><br><b>Q:  How do you like this build?</b><br>A:  It's... okay.  It's actually quite good if I'm not in the mood to play a character that relies on buffing and spell memorization, but the offensive stats in your melee form (whichever you pick) are pretty substandard for high-magic environments.  Defensively... with your hitpoints and DR, using the right shapes you can last a long time in combat against many opponents.  Your AC, however, is pretty lacking since you can only get the magical AC bonus from one item you wear and you have a -3 penalty when you rage.<br><br>In all, it's almost more of a gimmick build than anything, but it does have ways it can work.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Very cool! Nice to see something new <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  I'd definitely use the Drow shape with this build.
