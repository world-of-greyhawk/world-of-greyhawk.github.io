Looks similar to a build that is killing prismatics all over my screen. If you are adept at alignment changes try  Bard8/DwD22/PM10.  Has higher DR, more AC, higher saves, better BAB, bard song, and most important it has "use magic devices". In my version he became a parry master with level one in all the epic energy reduction. This is a real "wall".

Yeah if you take just 10 levels of bard and then 10 DD for your first 20 you'll have a better BAB by a few points, and if you finish off your build with a bard at 38 or 40 you can grab an extra 5 ac from tumble. Also don't you need 15 levels of PM to get epic spells? I know I've had this problem at least on the servers I've played, so you might need to go 11 bard 14 DD 15 PM. It seems like it's worked for you two though, so You'd still get the 18 DD for another 4/- dmg res<br>With this build you'd still get 10+3+3+3=19 dmg res if you took the epic feats. I'd also suggest dropping a point of con in the beginning and putting it into str, and since you won't be able to get immunity to mind/death spells as you would with a Wiz, I'd suggest not taking Great STR and instead grabbing epic fort/will.<br>You also won't need to add any to INT since bard spells only go up to 6 anyways. This way you can put your first four into con and then use all the rest for STR.<br>In the end you lose a few nice buffs with this build, but you get 5 more AC, 3 more BAB, better saves, and a few other bonuses. This would be a really strong PvP build, having trouble primarily with high ac casters and dragon shapes. Fortunately with all the hp this class has and the nice saves, casters should be less of a problem, and because of dmg res/high ac/decent ab, even those damned dragons will be within reach.

Great strength is nice, but I would still take the auto-still feats over GS. BAB won't be fantastic, so instead of trying to squeeze every point out of strength, i would take still spelling (cast bull's strength), and wear strength-increasing items.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.the-silver-river.com" target="_blank">www.the-silver-river.com</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bardan the Slayer on 12/26/04 13:51</span></i></p>

I was surprised when I saw that this build was transfered from the excellent character builds thread. I haven't said anything up to this point because I found the discussion interesting.  This build had come about from a discussion about how with the damage shield spells a fighter typically took more damage hitting a mage than the mage.  Of course since fighters have more hitpoints, they would typically still kill the mage.  This lead to the discussion on whether you could make a character whose main offense was just standing there and getting pummeled.  To deal with critical hits you needed the 10 PM levels, It's no good if you get dev. critted on the first attack.  While damage reduction spells are nice they don't last longer than a round or two and you needed to take some damage for atleast one of the shield spells to work, so epic warding was out.  That left natural damage reduction so the Dwarven Defender levels were added.  Finally, you wanted a fairly high caster level, so that the shields would do some real damage.  This sketch was the result of that discussion.  In testing, however, it was quite the dissapointment.<br><br>My other thought was some kind of druid/shifter/mage that would focus on an undead form, but what kind of fighter would attack an undead with damage shields up?  He'd just run.  No, you needed the threat of spellcasting to force the attack.  In the end I found my magical marauder build did a much better job than either of these builds, it could cast and fight like a dev. crit. fighter and if threatened by an opponent with dev. crit. it could cast the shield spells and shapeshift into Iron Golem form.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 12/28/04 20:06</span></i></p>
