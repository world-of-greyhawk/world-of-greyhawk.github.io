The basic idea is to use Ranger Empowered Cat's Grace stacked with Harper Scout Cat's Grace to fill out the dex bonus of light armor, allowing for a strength Ranger who can stealth and dual wield without relying on gear and without letting AC fall too far behind the Fighters in full plate.  By my math, with self buffing only, he will fill out hide armor 100% of the time, leather armor 81.25% of the time, and padded armor 18.75% of the time.  With just +2 dex from some other source, he can fill out leather armor 100% of the time, and padded armor 50% of the time.<br><br><b>Variations</b><br>It may seem strange to end Dex on an odd number, but half the time you'll be rolling an odd bonus from Cat's Grace(s), so the +1 will actually be useful.  Nonetheless, if it bothers you more than it bothers me ( <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ), it is possible to take two extra HS levels to get an extra Great Dex and even things out, though you lose two Favored Enemies and one AB/ Damage to those you have.<br><br>If you know you'll be able to get more than +2 Dex from gear without skipping over str gear, then I'd lower starting dex by 2 or 4 in favor of str, and exchange the selected HS bonus feat for an extra Favored Enemy.  You'll lose any chance of being able to use padded armor's full benefits, but leather armor will still work just fine at only 1 less AC.  If such is the case, you may even wish to drop Empower Spell in favor of something else.<br><br>For a straight level 40 build, or if you don't mind an XP penalty, Dwarf is a pretty good choice instead of human.  Rogue can also be used instead of Bard, but the lack of Spellcraft in the Rogue skill list makes Bard a better choice, imo.<br><br>For 1 extra AB, Bard can be delayed until Epic, but it should be noted that Bard Song will make up that AB with +1 damage to boot, not to mention the earlier use of UMD.  Also, taking Extra Music in exchange for an epic feat is probably not advisable.<br>_________________<br>(I enjoy writing parenthetically (a lot)).

The Extra Music feat is wasted - without a bardsong of at least 11th level, there's no point. I'd have to say Empower Spell is a waste, too. Cats grace is stackable, and you can get plenty of dex between the stackability and items and HS - thus, no need to waste those two feats. Get KD and IKD instead.<br><br>Also, because extra music is wasted, you can move that bard level into epic - or drop it altogether. Bard is fine and dandy for meeting the HS requirements, but you don't need two bard levels. If you replace it with ranger, you can grab another bonus feat, which you can use for Armor Skin and grab a great strength, which would legitimize shifting that point over from dex. You'd end up with two more AB and slightly stronger ranger spells - at the cost of two skillpoints.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

As it is, I get to use it three times more often than I would otherwise, and +1 to AB and Damage for everyone in your party is nothing to scoff at.  Nonetheless, I understand it doesn't fit everyone's taste, which is why I listed it as optional.  Knockdown, on the other had, I've grown rather tired of, and considering module builders frequently hand out knockdown immunity to anything important, I consider it nice, but optional for anything without Sneak Attacks.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; I'd have to say Empower Spell is a waste, too.

nothing i like more than a strong ranger.  the only change that i would make would be to drop hide by 20 points.  using spells you can make up for it.  then put those points into set traps, or maybe into search.  just gives you a few more options, without losing anything.<br><br>i think that dropping extra music is a good idea.  can use almost anything...save boosting, stealthiness, metamagic (unusal for a ranger but not unheard of...crafting scrolls or wands might be handy in some cases, but i can't think of many <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ).<br><br>just my two cents.<br><br>-cs<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By christian.schnabel on 09/21/06 23:22</span></i></p>
