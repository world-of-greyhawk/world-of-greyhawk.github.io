Rogue 20 gives you just a few skill points, you'd better go with Cl 15/Rogue 19/ Monk 6 for free KD/IKD and monk's speed increase or even Cl 17/ Rogue 17/ Monk 6 for lvl 9 spells.<br><br>By the way you'll have an xp penalty with three base classes. With this kind of build I'd go dexer to take advantage of both WIS and DEX boni to AC, eventually getting epic dodge, which pairs up nicely with II. And since you are a monk why not dual wield kamas?<br><br>If you want a disarmer you are better off using a 2-hander than a rapier. As for the second domain I would advice war if going the dex route, for cat's grace and aura of vitality.<br><br>Here's a dual kama wielder <b>I'm still working on</b>, the lvling works out technically but it's still far from efficient IMO (f.e. one should take more cleric preepic for save boosting and increased playability but that means getting the xp penalty earlier).

I want to thx you both for your help. I going to look at what you have given me and see what I can put together. Im really look @ a Pick pocket build. A real theif build. One whop if needs to can simply disappear when they need to. hence the invis and Greater Sanctuary. I think I may have tried to do this build a while back and found theat there was a problem with Pick pocket feat? Well any how, thx again.<br><br>CA.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.dladventures.com/" target="_blank">DLA</a> <br>I was baptized with the Holy Spirit when I took Him by simple faith in the Word of God....

Kail's build is nice. If you want something different, I would take the following into consideration:<br>1 - Stop monk levels at either 1 (just to get the Wis AC bump), 6 (to get IKD) or 9 (to get improved evasion). If you only take 1 take it near the end so the XP penalty doesn't hurt you for so long.<br>2 - If you want to avoid XP penalty, you need to balance either Monk and Rogue or Monk and Cleric. Possibilities would be Cleric 21/Monk 9/Rogue 10 (would let you pick up Epic Dodge), or Rogue 21/Monk 9/Cleric 10 (more sneak damge and skills, less spells). For the Cleric-heavy version you need a human, for the rogue version human or halfling will work. <br><br>Fewer than 9 monk levels is possible, but you won't be able to get Epic Dodge unless you make Rogue the primary class that way, in which case you don't get enough Cleric spellcasting to be worth it. <br><br>TM

Slightly different than what you requested, but have you considered being a dex based Cleric/ Monk/ Shadowdancer?  You lose out on Sneak Attack damage, an admittedly fairly big loss, but there is no XP penalty (for a human), and with 5 levels of SD and 9 levels of Monk, you can meet the prereqs for Epic Dodge while still keeping 26 Cleric levels.  If you can find room for the spell penetration feats, this will put you over the cap for stock spell resistance, and your buffs will only be dispellable by Mord's disjunction.  The only drawback (aside from no sneak damage) is that it might be too feat starved to include the two weapon fighting feats (not sure, haven't tried building it).<br><br>From an RP perspective, are you sure a lawful character would be doing any pickpocketing?<br>_________________<br>There's always time to procrastinate.
