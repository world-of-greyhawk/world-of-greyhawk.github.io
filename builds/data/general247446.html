How does this actually work? I have used it rarely and from what I can gather there is no fixed DC when casting spells. Can someone enlighten me about this please. Thanks

From the NWNWiki:<br><br><b>Casting Defensively</b>: If you want to cast a spell without provoking any attacks of opportunity, you must make a <i><b>concentration check</b></i> (<b>DC 15 + the level of the spell you’re casting</b>) to succeed. You lose the spell if you fail. <br><br>Check the links in my sig for the most useful sources of information about NWN.<br><br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Other.Detail&amp;id=729" target="_blank">Neverwinter Grimoire</a><br><a href="http://www.nwnwiki.org/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWN Wiki</a>

Question on this:  (sorry for dredging up an old topic)<br><br>I was reading up on this; and it seems that Defensive casting is a DC <i>19</i> +spell level if you are within 4 meters of the enemy.  Of course combat casting removes the -4 bringing you back to a DC 15+.<br><br>My question is; why does everyone suggest not using combat casting and ICC with casters (or at least combat casting)?  Certainly at level 35-40 a DC of 20-29 for your spells isn't all that bad with a concentration skill in the 40s <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  but at low levels that -4 penalty is quite steep.  I would think using CC at least for your low levels would equate to about a 50% better survivability rate.<br><br>Just curious as to the thinking on this, thanks in advance!<br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world

For me the reason not to take CC/ICC is being tight on feats. If my concentration ain't high enough instead of casting defensively I just take the AoO. <br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 09/25/06 11:58:10 (GMT) by xitooner<br><br>I find its better to be flexible, THINK, and know your enemy.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Most builds with a significant casting focus are too feat-starved for ICC, other than perhaps nearly pure wizard builds (as wizards get 4 bonus feats pre-epic).  In the epic levels, a "serious caster" is devoting 8 to 10 epic feats to Great Whatever, where Whatever is their casting stat (Int, Cha, Wis).  And one to epic spell focus and probably some to epic spells.<br><br>Caster-oriented clerics, druids, and sorcerers all tend to suffer from serious feat starvation overall - preepic you'll probably want 3 or 4 metamagic feats (extend, silent, maximize, empower), and probably toughness, which only leaves 2-3 feats to take anything else with... that probably will go to spell focus and greater spell focus, and then if you have a feat left still, maybe scribe scroll.<br><br>Wizards can get more preepic feats, and can probably afford regular combat casting, but their epic ones tend to be just as tight.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Depending what you're fighting, taking AoO can be beneficial, especially if using energy shields vs enemies who do little / no damage to you.
