I posted a build like that a long time ago, but it wasn't the best build, so I decided to improve it.  The nice thing about this kind of build is that you get tons of attacks/round with ITWF, haste, divine power, and flurry of blows, assuming you're wielding kamas.  You get Improved Evasion from Monk and Defensive Roll from Rogue, which allow you to get access to Epic Dodge.  You also get Uncanny Dodge, Improved Knockdown, and Crippling Strike if you want it.  <br><br>I would go Rogue 13/Monk 12/Cleric 15.  Race should be Halfling if you want the best AB possible with this build, Human if you want to avoid an XP penalty and get more skill credits.     <br><br>Stats:<br><br>Starting (assuming Halfling for race)<br><br>Str 10 <br>Dex 17 <br>Con 14<br>Int 14<br>Wis 14 <br>Cha 8<br><br>Ending <br><br>Str 10 <br>Dex 28 <br>Con 14<br>Int 14<br>Wis 18 <br>Cha 8<br>  <br>Pre-epic,  your class distribution should be<br>Rogue 4/Monk 8/Cleric 8.  <br><br>Domains: War and Trickery<br>         <br>Note: You could take Travel domain if you want haste, but you should be able to wear Robes of the Dark Moon if you are playing any of the official campaigns.

With 7d6 sneak attacks and Crippling Strike, you should be able to rip through anything that isn't immune to criticals.  Darkness and Ultravision will help you get sneak attacks, as will Improved Invis.  Crit immune foes are tougher, but with all the damage boosts you get from your Cleric spells (Divine Favor, Darkfire, etc.), as well as spells like Harm, you should be able to take them out as well.

Cool build, I think someone requested something like this on the other forum too.  You could get a slight improvement if you took epic prowness/armor skin instead of 2 of the great dexs.

Hmmm that might work, but I thought Epic Prowess didn't stack with Epic Weapon Focus?<br><br>Assuming it does, feat list would be like this:<br><br>1 Dodge<br>3 WF: Kama<br>6 Weapon Finesse (I always forget this!)<br>9 TWF <br>12 Ambidexterity<br>15 Extend Spell <br>18 ITWF<br>21 IWF: Kama<br>24 Epic Prowess<br>27 Armor Skin<br>30 Great Dex I<br>33 Great Dex II<br>36 Great Dex III<br>39 Epic Dodge<br><br>Ending Dex would only be 26, but AC would be 1 point higher.  BTW, AC calc is slightly off on the other post.  It would actually be 2 points higher (3 points with Armor Skin) than posted because you get +1 from Monk AC bonus at lvls 5 and 10.  Thus, it should be possible to get as high as 71 AC with +5 items and 91 AC with +10 items.

This build loses 3 points of AC from the previous version that took Epic Prowess and Armor Skin (-2 Armor Skin -1 Monk AC bonus), but gains a little more spell power and still manages to get Epic Dodge.

Here is the latest version of my Crippler build.  It's meant to be the strongest at lvl 40.  Unlike the previous versions, it gets skill mastery, which means it will be more effective with traps.  <br><br>It doesn't get IKD until lvl 40, but since it gives you -4 to your AB (and you've already got -4 if you're dual-wielding w/ Flurry of Blows active), I figured it wasn't quite as useful as it was before.  <br><br>Revised<br><br>Crippler<br><br>Rogue 19/Monk 6/Cleric 15<br>(Rogue 4/Monk 4/Cleric 12 pre-epic)<br><br>Race: Halfling<br><br>Domains: War and Trickery<br><br>(You could take Travel domain if you want Haste, but you should be able to wear Robes of the Dark Moon or boots of Speed if you are playing any of the official campaigns.

If the server has some crazy monk gloves, then perhabs you should request a build which focuses on monk unarmed dmg and AB+ viable AC. This build CripsyCritter has made is most for the use of weapons, due to that it has only 6 lvls of monk. Though it can be viable with monk gloves.<br>My suggestion is that you try a new request and see what comes out from the request <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br><br>Btw what server is that? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

Kalmar is correct, this build was intended for use with Kamas.  If you want to go Unarmed, I would recommend at least 12 Monk levels, as in Rogue 13/Monk 12/Cleric 15.  This will get you 1d12 unarmed strikes if you are a medium race, although I believe Gnomes and Halflings only get 2d4.  <br><br>Of course, since you get Greater Magic Weapon, you can easily enchant any Kamas you find to be +5 weapons, and of course you have Darkfire, which will cause them to do 1d6+5 magical damage per hit.  <br><br>That's the great thing about Clerics; they're versatile.  With all their buffs, they're not really dependent on magical equipment, so even with a set of perfectly mundane Kamas (no bonuses at all), you could probably still do OK.

Ok, here's an Unarmed version of the build.

Divine Power gives you an extra attack if the BAB increase you get from it earns you an extra attack.  That's why this build gets an extra attack from Divine Power.  It's pre-epic BAB goes from 15 to 20, giving it an extra attack.<br><br>The bug with Divine Power was that it was giving you an extra attack regardless of your pre-epic BAB.  For example, a build with 20 levels of fighter followed by 20 levels of cleric was still getting an extra attack at its highest attack value even though it's pre-epic BAB was already 20 and it had the full 4 attacks normally.  It ended up getting an extra 5th attack for no reason.  That part is what was fixed.<br><br>Steve

There is a problem with your kama version of this build. As a Halfling Kama's are considered Medium weapons for you. your penalties for carrying 2 kamas wouldnt be -2 -2 it would be as if you were carrying two longswords. Which is -4 -4 in it self i believe. So with flurry of blows it is -6 -6 not -4 -4. As a human i do not believe that will be the same as you figured due to them being considered small weapons for humans. But you would lose the +1 attack for halfling stature.<br><br>-FoG<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By _fist of god_ on 08/25/05 17:28</span></i></p>
