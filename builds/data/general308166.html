It seems 1.69 also fixed the bug where you sometimes completely stopped attacking after using WWA, happening in modules with .HAKs and the like.<br>_________________<br>People who say that I am arrogant are mistaken. Arrogance is a flaw; I am flawless.

I dunno. If you have IWWA, you're a DEXer and probably like sneak attacks, which WWAs are not.

I haven't checked assassin, but perhaps a single WWA could paralyze a lot of creatures at a time.  Or try shadow dancer where you hide, whirlwind, hide whirlwind.

It seems sneaks are impossible in whirlwind (even if the target is stunned).  What is possible is expertise mode (which may be a real boon given all your attacks are at full BAB).  The real thing that gives IWWA a significant leap in usage is that it works with on-hits.  Thus you could stun a few creatures each round meaning a lot less attacks on you.

I know its soo wrong, but if you think on it, bioware are genuis!!  See, all you are really doing is spinning in the air!

Err, I think it's that you can use it to start a combat and thus lure an enemy that's hiding under Greater Sanctuary into combat (thus breaking it), rather than being able to use it to attack without breaking your own GS.<br>_________________<br>People who say that I am arrogant are mistaken.
