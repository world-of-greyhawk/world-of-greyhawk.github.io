This build is the one I asked advice on earlier <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13422", "261037", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>here</a>. I decided to go 9/20/11 in the end for the level split. The synergy between Paladin and RDD is always nice, so there are a couple of builds that are similar to this, especially <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "211432", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>this one</a>, but my build doesn't aim for Dev Crit (and, for the record, none of my builds ever will). I've personally played this build to level 40 on a PvP server, and I had quite a bit of success with it, so I thought it'd be nice to share the end result.<br> ____________________<br><br>Most dragons adventurers get to deal with are creatures of evil; greedy, violent, and utterly malicious. Therefore it is no wonder that many people are afraid of dragons, and it is also no wonder that dragonslaying is an occupation offers great rewards along with great danger.<br><br>Not all dragons are evil, however. Some dragons are as sworn to the cause of good as any Paladin ever was, dedicating their incredible power to putting a stop to all evil. Sometimes these dragons come across a mortal in which they see a reflection of their own dedication. To these gifted individuals they offer training only a dragon can give. Not only strengthening the body beyond that of normal bodies, but also training the mind in both the arcane arts of dragonkind and the divine arts of those dedicated to protecting the world from evil. These mortals are called Dragon Saints, and are symbols of hope wherever they go.<br> ____________________<br><br><b>Dragon Saint</b><br>Sorcerer9/Paladin20/Red Dragon Disciple11<br>Playable 1-40 PvM &amp; PvP<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Lawful Good only<br><br>STR: 14 (22)<br>DEX: 12<br>CON: 12 (14)<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 12 (14)<br>CHA: 14 (26)<br> ____________________<br><br><b>01: Sorcerer(1):</b> Power Attack, Toughness<br><b>02: Sorcerer(2)</b><br><b>03: Paladin(1):</b> Knockdown<br><b>04: Paladin(2):</b> CHA+1<br><b>05: Paladin(3)</b><br><b>06: Paladin(4):</b> Weapon Focus: Longsword<br><b>07: Paladin(5)</b><br><b>08: Paladin(6):</b> CHA+1<br><b>09: Paladin(7):</b> Divine Shield<br><b>10: Paladin(8)</b><br><b>11: Paladin(9)</b><br><b>12: Paladin(10):</b> CHA+1, Divine Might<br><b>13: Paladin(11)</b><br><b>14: Paladin(12)</b><br><b>15: Paladin(13):</b> Improved Critical: Longsword<br><b>16: Paladin(14):</b> CHA+1<br><b>17: Paladin(15)</b><br><b>18: Paladin(16):</b> Blind Fight<br><b>19: Paladin(17)</b><br><b>20: Paladin(18):</b> CHA+1<br><b>21: Red Dragon Disciple(1):</b> Armor Skin<br><b>22: Red Dragon Disciple(2)</b><br><b>23: Red Dragon Disciple(3)</b><br><b>24: Red Dragon Disciple(4):</b> CHA+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword<br><b>25: Red Dragon Disciple(5)</b><br><b>26: Red Dragon Disciple(6)</b><br><b>27: Red Dragon Disciple(7):</b> Epic Prowess<br><b>28: Red Dragon Disciple(8):</b> CHA+1<br><b>29: Red Dragon Disciple(9):</b><br><b>30: Red Dragon Disciple(10):</b> Improved Knockdown<br><b>31: Paladin(19)</b><br><b>32: Sorcerer(3):</b> CHA+1<br><b>33: Sorcerer(4):</b> Disarm<br><b>34: Sorcerer(5)</b><br><b>35: Sorcerer(6)</b><br><b>36: Sorcerer(7):</b> CHA+1, Epic Skill Focus: Discipline<br><b>37: Sorcerer(8)</b><br><b>38: Sorcerer(9)</b><br><b>39: Paladin(20):</b> Epic Skill Focus: Concentration<br><b>40: Red Dragon Disciple(11):</b> CHA+1<br><br>Concentration: 43(55)<br>Discipline: 43(59)<br>Lore: 8(10)<br>Spellcraft: 40(42)<br>Taunt: 9(17)<br>Tumble: 20(21)<br>(<i>apart from Tumble, max skills only when they are Class Skills</i>)<br> ____________________<br><br><b>Buffed stats with mundane equipment:</b><br>AC: 54<br>HP: 532<br>BAB: 29<br>AB: 47 (can be raised for a short duration with True Strike if you're fighting a high-AC opponent)<br><br>4 Attacks per round (5 with Haste)<br><br>Fortitude: 36<br>Reflex: 28<br>Will: 32<br>(Spells +8)<br><br>Concentration: 58<br>Discipline: 62<br>Lore: 11<br>Spellcraft: 43<br>Taunt: 20<br>Tumble: 21<br> ____________________<br><br><b>Variations:</b><br><br>Taking Sorc4/Pal26/RDD10 gives you less Sorc spells, but makes your Paladin spells untouchable to any of the Dispel spells (lesser, normal, and greater), and gives you two bonus Paladin feats.<br><br>In PvE, it's usually safe to drop the two Skill focuses.

Buff up using your long lasting (Hour/level or Minute/level) spells before combat with your armor off, put on your armor, and wade into battle. Use shorter lasting spells just before entering combat. Try to keep up important defensive stuff (like Divine Shield) at all times. Spells like True Strike or Darkness can be cast in armor, so you can use them during battle when you need them. Against a hard-to-hit opponent, use True Strike followed by Improved Knockdown. Holy Sword will be of great use against mages and other buffed characters (especially mages who rely on damage shields like Mestil's), and your good saves and AC will keep you safe against a lot of things.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By LuckyNephilim on 01/07/07 13:03</span></i></p>

WHY would you take RDD past 10? It gets you nothing. Drop one level of it and you can grab 5th level spells.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

Hehe I got the same comment earlier, and as I said before, there isn't any 'right' choice here... 5th level spells are useless in this build anyway (there's a post halfway <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13422", "261037", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>this topic</a> in which I explain why no 5th level spells), and neither a Sorc nor a Pally level really gives me anything extra.<br><br>At least RDD as a final level gives more HP than Sorc, and allows me to max out skills like Discipline, Concentration, and Spellcraft if I want. It's a tiny advantage I admit, but just as tiny as either of the other classes would offer.<br><br>If you feel that 5th level spells would give you some sort of benefit, by all means switch that last level of RDD for Sorc. It doesn't damage the build.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By LuckyNephilim on 01/07/07 17:43</span></i></p>

Looks like an excellent build.  Most things I'd change are things you mention in the description as optional.  However, a couple things:<br><br>-I'd start leveling with Paladin levels instead of Sorcerer.  You will get more total skill points if your first level is Paladin, and it's also easier to level up a melee fighter at very low levels than it is an arcane caster.<br><br>-You mention that the reason you don't consider Energy Buffer or Lesser Mind Blank useful is the short duration.  In NWN, an "hour" is only two minutes, meaning a spell with a duration of 1 hour/level only lasts twice as long as one with a duration of 1 turn/level.  With ten caster levels, turn/level spells will last 10 minutes, which is plenty long enough to cast in advance and still have them be useful.  Therefore, I'd say Sorc 10 is probably your best option.

Hm yeah I know... I guess it's personal preference, and like I said if you want to use level 5 spells feel free to take that Sorc level because it doesn't really hurt the build. It also depends on the server you play... on a higher magic server where Golden Circlets (or other mind-immunity items) and elemental resistance items (also remember RDD is already immune to fire) are available those spells become a lot less useful. On a low magic server they would be good to use though, I guess.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By LuckyNephilim on 01/08/07 09:19</span></i></p>

I'll suggest taking extend spell and/or still spell together with 10 lvls of sorc.<br>The lvl 5 slots can be used for your precious lvl 4 spells with metamagic.<br><br>Extend will make your long term buffs last 20 min/20 rounds instead of 9.<br>Still will let you cast in actual combat, opening up for a wider spell choice, including short time spells. You will also be able to recast sorc spells if dispelled.<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan

That's a very valid point, and one I'm ashamed to say I hadn't even thought of.<br><br>So yeah... Switching that 11th RDD level for Sorc and getting a Metamagic feat in stead of... say Disarm or ESF: Concentration is definately an improvement.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By LuckyNephilim on 01/08/07 18:18</span></i></p>
