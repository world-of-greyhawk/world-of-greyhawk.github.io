I apologise firstly if this is in the wrong area, but I have a question with Monks. I currently play on an Action server, 40 level tops, where PVP is quite big, now, as with virtually all PVP's nowerdays the abundance of Sorcs/Wiz's is tremendous, my first attempt to stop these was my very own, and PVP battles have now become whoever casts Mord's Dis. and spams IGMS first wins. But I'm thinking about a Monk, purely to look cool with spells doing nothing but puff above my head! Annnyways, I've looked through the Epic Builds list, and I'm VERY impressed, and I found quite a few monk builds, including Mithdradates Mage Bane, and WildMustangs MageHunter. I'm real new to builders however, and was wondering if anyone could help me out with my question. Seeing as we have 2 awesome Mage killing builds there, I was wondering how I would go about creating a Magekiller - either pure Monk or not, that wields dual Kama's (simply because the server I has contains VERY powerful magical Kama's, and if I made a Monk not exploiting them, it wouldn't feel right <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> ). I know it will probably be a very easy adaptation, but I really am that new to Builders. So I'm asking firstly, I will obviously need to find space for the 3 Two-wep fighting feats, bit unsure what I would want to drop, with SR being something I don't want to lower. Secondly, considering this build will be PURELY for the killing of Mages (I have other builds on this server - a Tank, and a personal fave - the dual-kukri wielder), would I want to multiclass like the 2 builds I mentioned before do? Sorry if I've confused, I've been babbling for quite some time now, but any help will be GREATLY appreciated. Thank you very much!

well for the best magekiller i'd do the following<br><br>first, check out the mages builds, all you care about is how many levels of sorc they have, most will be high, but doable (38ish probably) you want at least equal SR to a pure monk of that level, preferably a little more.<br><br>remember epic spell resist feats are nice <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>the bane of magekilling monks is acid sheath, I highly suggest a level of rogue, both for the 1d6 sneak and scroll use, so you can nail them with a breach scroll THEN beat them up.<br><br>My personal favorite build for monk isnt really antimage, but it works, its<br>7 monk 7 rogue, 7 weaponmaster, then the rest rogue with +1monk at the end<br>you end up with outragous damage, gigantic sneaks, and something in the ballpark of 13 attacks per round, on the server i play on, I can drop anyone in one combat round or less, (output is over 1000damage/round)<br><br>now if you want everything to go poof, i'd suggest pure monk, with a few levels of CoT or fighter since you are going to be low on feats (basically every pre-epic feat you are going to get is going twards duel weilding) I'd suggest having low dex, very high str (more damage) and decent wisdom, since your only caring about mages, stunning fist/quivering palm will work against any non-pallysorc.  take epic spell resistance to get more than the magic number above, and make sure you take at least one epic acid resist feat if you cant get really high acid/fire resists from items.
