Imo your build needs some serious tweaking in the chosen feats...No meta magic feats, no spell pen fetas, no divine shield...Depending of your pw, your spell efficiency wont be that good and tumble is a cross class skill, you cant have more than 20...<br><br>I think you should concentrate on spell feats rather than melee ones...You rely on your spells, you dont really need wf &amp; ewf, knockdown ( the bigby spell does it for you ) or epic reflex...<br>I'd lower the starting stats a bit; dx to 8, Co and int to 12 for example; this would allow you to reach the same final stats without spending 2 greater charismas.<br>That way, you could prolly get some epic spells.<br><br>Also, by going 26/4/10, you would have 1 more feat at the cost of 2 in ab.

I was aiming at maing a melee-oriented character using spells for buffing and defense  and as an alternate choice for offense, but it wouldn't work that good at all since I can't achieve a BAB of 16 pre-epic. The high CHA yields good saves and a good divine might, but I lack in terms of AB and AC. <br><br>I'll try to rebuild it following your advice to make it into a casting-oriented character who can still go melee if need be. I just don't like lowering his INT to 12 though. That means an important loss of skill points and this character lacks this. I could maybe lower Discipline and Concentration, and maybe try to fit in the combat casting feats. And I just realized you can actually get both divine feats with only 4 levels of blackguard, so I'll try that too. We'll see how in turns out. <br><br>BTW, I actually meant "Tumble: 20 (40 cc)" as in you have 20 points in tumble but you need to spend 40 to get those, since tumble is a cross-classed skill.
