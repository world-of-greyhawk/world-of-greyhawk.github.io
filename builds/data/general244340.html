I just made a rather absurd build (a Monk/Cleric/Wizard) which achieved the unlikely feat of having a pre-epic BAB of only 9.  This meant that, using the Monk attack schedule on a single kama, I had 3 base APR.  When I cast Divine Power, I expected that number to increase to 6, which is the number of main-hand, non-hasted, non-flurry attacks usually touted by DP spammers.  However, I was dismayed to find, upon testing, that I only got 5 APR.<br><br>My question is, why?  Is there a hard cap on the number of attacks you can gain from DP?  Or is there some other issue with the build that prevents it from getting a sixth attack?
