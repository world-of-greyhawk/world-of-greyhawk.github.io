This guide is a general guide more than a technical one.  There are already many guides out there to find out all the different numbers involved in the forms (stats, attacks, damage, etc.), so I thought I'd write up more of a strategy guide than a reference.  If I make an error, PLEASE point it out.  I hope that this is as accurate as possible, but I'm sure I'll slip up somewhere.  Also, feel free to add whatever you'd like.<br><br>Let me begin by saying I love shifters.  They are unarguably the most versatile class in NWN, with a wide range of shapes, each with a wide range of abilities.<br><br>You won't be dealing damage like a weaponmaster... you won't be flinging down meteors or throwing bigbies... you won't be dealing 20d6 sneak attacks... you won't be getting 30/- DR... But you will be able to do a little of everything, and do it well enough to survive almost any encounter if you know your shifter inside and out.<br><br>Keep in mind at all times that the shifter's versatility is its key to success.  Know all your shapes, know their limitations, know their advantages, and know their disadvantages.  Going up against a red dragon as an iron golem and trying to poison it will get you slaughtered.<br><br>Also keep in mind that this same versatility allows you to be very flexible in adding a 3rd class.  My shifter is currently a druid/shifter/shadowdancer, which makes for an exceedingly fun combination (if you want a druid/shifter/shadowdancer build, check the other forum for my Shadow Shifter).  The shifter blends in well with almost any class...<br><br>Do you want to be a melee shifter?  Put in 4 levels of a class with a fighter BAB pre-epic (8/8/4 druid/shifter/other) and you've got 4 attacks in all your forms.<br><br>Want to be sneaky?  Tack on rogue for hide and move silently to complement the forms that give you bonuses to these, and get a sneak attack in all your forms.  Or use shadowdancer for hide in plain sight and evasion goodness.  That and tumble for even more AC.<br><br>Want more magic?  Just stick with druid and you can access 9th level druid spells and gain elemental forms... or even add on wizard (I know there are some shifter/wizard builds out there, take a look).<br><br>The one thing I don't suggest is to go 30 shifter.  Your DCs for your special abilities will only go up marginally, and at the very least you're passing up more druid power and much better buffs.<br><br>Let me also say that I hate monk/shifters.  They make me twitch.  I will say that they are very powerful, but if you want to get more information on them, check another source.<br><br>We'll go into more depth with this later.  For now, let's start with the basics.<br><br><b>Races for shifters</b><br><br>Each race has its advantages and disadvantages, as always.  However, there's one very important thing involving races and shifting: stat adjustments do NOT apply while shifted.  For example, let's say you have a dwarf shifter.  Your +2 con goes away, as does your -2 charisma, whenever you shift from a dwarf.  So, unfortunately, a half-orc shifter would NOT get a +2 strength to their dragon shape, for example.<br><br>Humans are generally the best race to go with for most cases.  You get an extra skill point, an extra feat, and your favored class is any in case you want to get creative with multiclassing.<br><br>Dwarves get darkvision, some training versus orc, goblins, and giants, and some protection against spells and poisons.  Not much going for them for a shifter.<br><br>Elves are immune to sleep, have proficiencies in longsword/rapier/shortbow/longbow, better listen/search/spot, and keen senses.  Extra weapon proficiencies are ALWAYS welcome, though the bows won't do you much good.  Keen senses is nice, but you have forms with true sight when you really need it.<br><br>Gnomes aren't too interesting.  You get some training versus goblins, giants, and reptilians, as well as better listen and concentration.<br><br>Half-elves are immune to sleep, hardy vs. enchantments, and have a favored class of any, with low light vision to boot.  Given that a human gets an extra feat and an extra skill point per level versus immunity to sleep and hardiness vs. enchantments, there's not much reason to be a half-elf.<br><br>Half-orcs get darkvision.  That's it.  The stat adjustments are useless, you won't see the +2 strength in any of your forms.<br><br>Halflings get a +1 to all saving throws, +2 vs. fear, skill affinities for move silently and listen, and your favored class is rogue.  If you're thinking of going with a rogue/shifter, this is definitely a good possibility.<br><br>So now we've looked at all the races.  Human is generally going to be the best; again, humans tend to be versatile (extra feat and skill points, favored class any), which fits in well with a shifter.  Halflings are also good candidates.<br><br>Now then, on to...<br><br><b>Stats for shifters</b><br><br>Stat allocation is everyone's favorite part, I'm sure.  Let's take a quick look at all the stats we have to work with, and prioritize which ones are the most important.  Keep in mind this is disregarding any third class you may wish to take, so adjust as necessary.<br><br>Strength is useless, I'll say it up front.  There are very few forms that do NOT override strength, and those tend not to need it.  For example, the kobold commando doesn't... but it gets its AB from its high dexterity and its damage from its sneak attacks and nasty little sword.  The only reason you'd want to get a high strength is to get feats like Power Attack and Cleave... which are nice, but you've got cleave on some forms and your AB will tend not to be high enough to put power attack to any use.  You will not hurt yourself essentially at all by leaving strength at 8 (or 6 if you're a halfling/gnome).  If you need to carry things, that's what minotaur's for.<br><br>Dexterity is not quite as useless.  It's still overridden in most cases, but not as often as strength.  You can also pick up some nice feats with a 13+ dex (dodge, mobility, spring attack), though they won't help you THAT much.  If you can spare the points, leaving at 12 or 10 even is generally fine, though you should at least put some points into it to make sure your AC doesn't die horribly on some shapes.<br><br>Constitution is the least overridden physical stat.  You still don't want to waste too many points on it, but setting it to 12-14 will help most of your forms with hp.<br><br>Intelligence is very important.  I recommend setting this to at least 13 for some very key feats that can help out all shifters.  Improved Knockdown and the Expertise line are exceedingly helpful, and I'll get into those later.  Also, more skills never hurt.<br><br>Wisdom is definitely the most important.  You're going to need a 25 wisdom for outsider shape, a 27 wisdom for construct shape, and a whopping 30 wisdom for dragon shape.  Fortunately the shifter gets Great Wisdom as one of its bonus feats... but even with that, you'll need to start high.  If you're going to be gunning for epic shapes, you'll want to start with a 17 or 18 in wisdom.  If you're going to be starting at level 40 and can wait a bit, starting at 16 may not kill you if you desperately need a boost in your other stats... but given that you can generally leave your physical stats at lower numbers, 17 should be your minimum here.  You want epic shapes... they will be your friends.<br><br>Charisma is useless.  That's all I can say about it.  Don't bother unless your third class really needs it or you're taking it for RP.<br><br>So basically you want to prioritize in wisdom/intelligence/constitution, in about that order.  Season as desired... again, there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to shifters, just general guidelines to follow so you don't shoot yourself in the foot.<br><br>And now, for...<br><br><b>Third classes for shifters</b><br><br>Let's take a look at the core classes first.<br><br>Barbarians are fun.  They have a d12 hit die, a surprisingly decent amount of skill points, and a rage ability you can use in all your forms.  Given that it runs on your con bonus for duration, however, it will only really be useful in certain forms.  A dragon, however, will have a very long lasting rage with its massive constitution.  If you invest enough barbarian levels, you can also get damage reduction, and Uncanny Dodge, which is a great feat for shifters given the exceedingly high dex of some forms.  The 10% movement increase also helps, and if you plan out pre-epic right, you can get 4 attacks per round in every form.  Not too bad at all.<br><br>Bards can bring along their bard song (which works in all forms), though their spells will be fairly useless.  I don't have much experience with bard/shifter builds, so there's not much I can say about them.<br><br>Clerics get to share your high wisdom for their spells, and cleric buffs can be great.  Your turn undead will be relatively useless, but being able to buff yourself up with spells like Endurance, Cat's Grace, Owl's Wisdom, and Divine Power can be useful.  Druids get a lot of cleric spells (such as bull's strength, death ward, etc.), and you won't get that high in spell levels unless you really devote a lot into the class, so this may not be the best choice.<br><br>Fighters get some free feats, which are always nice, though you won't get much out of weapon focus/spec feats, since what forms you do have that are armed all have different weapons.  It may not be too bad of an idea to try and specialize in one or two (such as the drow's longsword, or the lizardfolk's whip, or the risen lord's scythe), but those feats can be better used elsewhere for the most part.  If you time it right, you can get 4 attacks with this class.<br><br>Monks... ow.  They get unarmed attack progression in all unarmed forms, wisdom AC bonus to ALL forms, as well as all monk abilities.  They make me twitch, and I won't go into them any further.<br><br>Paladins need to be lawful good.  Druids must be neutral on one axis.  Unless you've got a way to alignment shift, this isn't going to happen.  Should you find it possible, you won't get much either.  You'll be immune to fear by level 2, you add your (usually) non-existant charisma bonus to saving throws, you're immune to disease (which you can remove by a spell at that point), and you can smite evil.  You can get 4 attacks per round, but the fighter's extra feats or the barbarian's special abilities will be more useful at that point.  You could theoretically shoot for a high charisma and pick up divine might and divine shield, but it's not recommended.<br><br>Rangers pretty much just get favored enemies as a bonus (trackless step is already on druid, as is animal companion), and 4 attacks per round if done right.  The two weapon fighting feats are completely and utterly useless.  If you invest enough levels in ranger, perhaps the favored enemies will become useful, but in general it's not worth it.<br><br>Rogues are fun.  You pick up sneak attack in EVERY form (just imagine a dragon with a +10d6 sneak attack with improved knockdown, improved evasion, and a ridiculously high hide and move silently), evasion, uncanny dodge, and loads of skill points.  A lot of your shapes get bonuses to hide, move silently, and other rogue-based skills to further your sneakiness.  With Tumble as a class skill you can boost your generally poor AC to decent levels as well.  Also, later on you can pick up improved evasion, crippling strike, etc.  A versatile class for a versatile prestige class makes for a great choice.<br><br>Sorcerors won't do much for you.  You have to have a decent charisma, and your buffs could easily just be cast by a wizard.  If you want an arcane caster, go wizard.<br><br>Wizards, speaking of which, can offer a few advantages.  There's a druid/shifter/wizard build out there by SBully that specializes in the rakshasa form, take a look there for more ideas.<br><br>Barbarians, fighters, and rogues are generally the best base classes to add on (aside from monk, but as I said- ah, you know the rest) to your shifter.<br><br>Now let's take a look at some of the prestige classes... I won't go through every one, but rather just the ones that stand out.<br><br>Shadowdancer will get you HiPS with all your forms, as well as Evasion and Uncanny Dodge.  You get HiPS for free in the kobold form, however, so if you find yourself not needing it that much, the feat/skill requirements might not be worth the benefits.  Rogue might be the better choice, since it also offers sneak attacks and other fun abilities on top of that (and you can always just go kobold if you need HiPS).  As a hidden bonus, if you manage to get enough levels for Shadow Daze, you can actually get a fairly nice DC from your enormous dragon/kobold/drow dexterities alone.<br><br>Dwarven Defenders can net you a lot of DR.  A popular combination is a druid/shifter/DD that specializes in the risen lord form, which has 50% slash/pierce immunity, and then the DD reduction on top of that.  Combined with immunity to crits and sneak attacks, it's one hard character to even hurt.<br><br>Assassins get a death attack that stacks with the kobold's sneak attack (a normal rogue's sneak attack does NOT stack with the kobold's), and since you can spare your other stats to take a higher int, your DC won't be too bad.  A nice alternative to rogue.<br><br>Champion of Torm can be an interesting alternative to fighter.  You'll get a bonus to your saves as well as bonus feats, and you can get 4 attacks per round.  You can also take CoT into epic levels and use its bonus feats for Great Wisdom, which can actually get you your epic forms sooner if you're willing to deal with a lower amount of levels of Shifter (where you may lose epic upgrades to your shapes, which are quite nice).<br><br>Now that we're done there, let's take a look at...<br><br><b>Feats for shifters</b><br><br>I won't go through every feat that's out there, but I'll point out some that are relevant.<br><br>When choosing feats, unless you're going for an extremely specialized build, always keep the following question in mind: "Will this benefit most of my forms?"  If it won't, don't touch it.<br><br>Alertness is key, since you kind of need it to become a shifter.<br><br>Called Shot won't do you much good.  You're going to be low on AB as it is, making it any lower won't help matters.<br><br>Cleave is nice, as always, but you're also going to need the relatively useless to you Power Attack.  If you've got feats to burn, not a bad choice... though you'll also need a 13 strength to get it.<br><br>Disarm and Improved Disarm fall under Called Shot.  Your AB is too low to use these well.<br><br>Dodge is nice, but there are better out there.  +1 AC against your last attacker won't exactly tip the scales in any way, but it doesn't hurt either.  You can follow up with Mobility and Spring Attack, but that's only useful if you have a low Tumble.<br><br>Extend Spell is nice.  Since you can't cast while shifted, anything to make your buffs last longer is a good thing.<br><br>Empower Spell is nice for one thing: ice storms.  You can prepare an empowered ice storm, and EVERY SINGLE ICE STORM that your rakshasa casts will be empowered as well.  This also goes for Maximize Spell, if you've got enough druid levels to manage to prepare one.<br><br>Improved Critical: Unarmed can be useful, since it will benefit most of your forms.  Taking improved critical in any other weapon will severely limit you, but if you've got feats to burn, you can always try and improve a specific shape.<br><br>Weapon Focus: unarmed does not work for a shifter's unarmed forms.  Oddly enough, Epic Weapon Focus: unarmed, DOES work.  Just something to keep in mind.<br><br>Knockdown and Improved knockdown are your friends.  You want them.  Here's how knockdown works, as a quick refresher: you take a -4 AB penalty on your attack... you then add +4 AB for every size category larger you are than the target.  So a human trying to knockdown a gnome takes the -4 AB penalty, then adds +4 for being one size category larger, and so ends up taking no penalty whatsoever to try and knock down the gnome.  Improved Knockdown makes you count as one size category larger.  This means that you're now adding +8 AB against that gnome, for a net +4 AB INCREASE over not trying to knock them down.  Taking this a step farther, a dragon will be a size 5, size 6 with IKD.  A medium creature is a size 3, small is size 2.  This means that the dragon is adding a whopping +12 to their AB (+8 net after the -4 penalty originally) against medium creatures, and +16 (+12 total) against small creatures.  All that and you get to knock them down too.  This works on other forms as well, so a minotaur is getting a bonus to their AB for trying to knockdown small/medium creatures (though at +8/+4 net respectively).<br><br>Toughness is a generally good all around feat.  Free hp in all forms is always a good thing.  If you have an extra feat and you're wondering what to use it on, you can never go wrong with Toughness.<br><br>Blind Fight is your friend.  It will benefit all of your forms, and with your generally low AB the last thing you want to worry about is concealed enemies dancing around and laughing at you.  Definitely a worthwhile feat.<br><br>Expertise and Improved Expertise are extremely useful feats.  Aside from your AB, your AC will be your second problem.  When you really need it, Expertise and Improved Expertise can be a godsend.  You can have +10 AC while using all your forms' special abilities (activating Improved Expertise and then using dragon breath is a fun tactic), or you could just be a better tank in general.  Highly recommended for any shifter.<br><br>And now for epic feats...<br><br>Great Wisdom and your epic shapes are your first priorities.  Once you're through those (or you have as many as you want, though it's recommended to get as many as you can), there are some others to look at.<br><br>Armor Skin is great.  +2 AC to all your forms, not much more can be said.  Definitely worth it.<br><br>Epic Prowess adds +1 to your AB.  Since you have a low AB to start with, and this benefits all your forms, it's a good choice all around.<br><br>Epic Toughness will work in all forms (Great Constitution can get overridden), so if you've got extra epic feats to spare, it can't hurt.<br><br>There are obviously other epic feats out there, but they will depend on the build you have.  For example, Improved Sneak Attack might be useful for a rogue/shifter.<br><br>Now that we've covered useful feats...<br><br><b>Equipment for a shifter</b><br><br>One of the great things about a shifter is that their equipment merges into their form.  However, there are many little intricacies that you need to be acutely aware of to get the most out of your shifter's merging capabilities.<br><br>Firstly, know that abilities and bonuses do not stack.  It takes the highest bonus from all your items and applies only that.  This means that if you have a +3 armor and a +3 shield, your total AC bonus when shifted will only be +3 from items.  If you have a +1 regen ring and a +1 regen amulet, you will only get +1 regen while shifted, if you have two +3 strength rings you'll only get +3 strength total when shifted, etc.<br><br>Secondly, not all shapes merge everything.  Any shape without a weapon will not merge your weapon, obviously.  The general rule is that if it walks on two legs, it merges items and armor.  If it doesn't, it only merges armor (armor, helm, shield).  Golems are an exception in that only the iron golem merges your items along with your armor.  Dragon only merges armor.<br><br>The more variety of items you can equip the better.  Picking up a heavy armor proficiency can give you access to more varieties of armor, and more weapon proficiencies can give you access to more magical weapons that can be useful in armed forms.  Choose weapons and armor only for their magical properties... for example, if you have to choose between +3 leather and +2 full plate, the +3 leather will actually do you more good once you shift.  A dagger with +2d6 acid will be superior to a greatsword with +1d6 cold, etc.  Only the properties matter, not the base damage/AC/etc.<br><br>So now that you've got your shifter made, geared up, and ready for fighting, let's go over...<br><br><b>Shifter strategies</b><br><br>You have a form for every encounter.  You may just not know it yet.<br><br>Spells getting you down?  Rakshasa, drow warrior, iron golem, spectre, risen lord, slaadi, kobold commando, all of these are great forms.  Got a crazy barbarian charging at you?  Mindflayer blast him, or dominate him with vampire gaze.  Rogues getting you down?  Golems, undead, and dragon will tear them apart.  Got a horde of baddies surrounding you?  Demonflesh golem, lizardfolk whipmaster, gargoyle, risen lord.  Want damage output?  Azer chieftain, minotaur, drow warrior.  Need ranged damage?  Manticore spikes can be deadly.<br><br>Anyway, time to go into more detail...<br><br><i>Shifters vs. Spellcasters</i><br><br>Rakshasa is the obvious choice here.  Immunity to 8th level spells and below, and a spellcraft bonus for a bonus to saves against any 9th level spells that DO get through (and a +2 universal save bonus on top of that).  You also have unlimited dispells (though they'll be fairly useless when 1.64 comes out), and unlimited ice storms that you can nail a caster from a distance with.  Or just beat them with your +5 +1d10 fire staff, which will go through any DR they can come up with except for epic warding.<br><br>The epic drow warrior has a 30 SR and improved evasion, as well as a nasty sword that requires a fortitude save or the target gets slowed.  Not a bad choice.<br><br>The iron golem has vulnerability to fire, but if your caster friend decides not to take advantage of that, you've got immunity to mind spells, immunity to death magic, an SR of 26, and 90% immunity to electricity.<br><br>Slaadi has 10/- to all elements, great for withstanding a hellball.  Immunity to fear and a 15/+5 DR on top of a relatively decent attack makes it decent against casters, though if you can be a slaadi, you can be a rakshasa.<br><br>The epic kobold commando has HiPS and a sneak attack... if true seeing is nerfed and you've got some decent skills, then this could be a very effective mage killer.  You also get Freedom of Movement, which is always a nice bonus, and Improved Evasion to boot.<br><br>If you want to give an abysmal-fortitude mage a fun surprise, pull out the basilisk.  A DC in the 20s for a petrify that can go through Greater Sanctuary and gets no spellcraft bonus to the save that they probably rely on can be nasty.  The medusa has this too.<br><br><i>Shifters vs. Melees</i><br><br>Melees have no will saves.  They also tend not to have any eyesight.  use this to your advantage.<br><br>Kobold Commando with HiPS can kill a melee before they know what hit them... assuming they don't have spot or listen enough to beat your own scores.  With a +5d6 sneak attack and a high AB bonus (+13, the highest of all forms except dragon), and with catching your opponent flat footed, you'll get loads of sneaks in.<br><br>If you're up against someone with Devastating Critical, the risen lord form may be your best choice.  Watch out for knockdowns, but otherwise you'll be immune to crits, and you'll have 50% slash/pierce immunity.<br><br>Vampire may also be a good choice... while you lose the 50% slash/pierce immunity, you can try to use your domination gaze on their low will save.  Watching them wander around like a lost puppy while you slowly drain their life force away never gets old.<br><br>If you're in a PvM situation, using the gaze on a large group of melee enemies almost ensures that one will fail.  If you keep spamming the unlimited gaze on the group, you'll eventually turn them all against each other (after the domination ends they'll still attack one another).  It's beautiful.<br><br>The whipmaster also can be quite handy.  It has 15/+5 DR and a nasty, nasty whip with disarm.  Unfortunately your disarm may not be very useful, since anything worth disarming will generally have a very high discipline that you won't have a prayer of touching, but it's still useful nonetheless.<br><br>The epic drow warrior has a very powerful blade and a high AC (29 prebuffed, only topped by the dragon, spectre, and slaad).  The freeze effect most likely won't go through often due to their high fortitude saves, unfortunately.<br><br>Mindflayer blasts can also be deadly.  Just be ready to reshift, as your gazes aren't endless.<br><br>The ultimate form, though, is of course the dragon.  After 1.64 you will have +6 claws and 40/+6 DR.  You also have a 43 AC base, the highest of all your forms by far, and a +19 bonus to your AB, also your highest of all your forms.  If you have a class with Tumble, and you've got expertise and improved expertise, as well as barkskin, your AC can go through the roof.  With IKD your AB is also going to be deadly, adding a further +8 to all your attacks against medium creatures.  And if that isn't enough to hit your enemy, you can use your quite nasty breath weapon with improved expertise on.  A pure fighter will tend to have low reflex saves, so they'll be taking the brunt of the damage most of the time.<br><br>You can also go drider or pre-epic drow for Darkness.  With ultravision on, you'll have 50% concealment while they don't have any.  Think of it like a poor man's improved invisibility.<br><br>If you need to really tank while other party members do the damage dealing, the epic gargoyle will have 25/+7 DR, with 25/- pierce resist once 1.64 comes out.  Not a good choice in PvP, but in PvM it can be great being surrounded by monsters that can't scratch you while your friends enjoy being able to leisurely blast them to bits.<br><br><i>Shifters vs. Rogues</i><br><br>Dragon.  Unless the surrounding environment makes this hard (lots of doors and corridors), dragon gets true sight to nail any hiding rogues and shadowdancers, and it's immune to sneak attacks.  Also, the ginsu halflings of death can't knock you down even with IKD.  Without sneak attacks OR hiding, they're seriously crippled.<br><br>If dragon isn't an option, any of the undead forms will generally be a good idea.  Your vampire gaze will probably not work well due to Slippery Mind, but a risen lord with its 50% slash/pierce immunity will be every rogue's worst nightmare.  If you've got a knockdown happy rogue to worry about, spectre can work fairly well (and your level drain attack might actually end up being useful against their low fortitude).<br><br>Golems also gain immunity to sneak attacks.  The iron golem has the third highest AB for those high AC rogues, making it a good choice.<br><br>It's probably a good idea to invest in Spot or Listen heavily as well.  While you do get forms with true seeing, a shadowdancer will have a field day with your golem or undead even with his general lack of damage if you can't see them through other means.  If you have enough intelligence, you'll have enough skill points to throw around anyway.<br><br><i>Shifters vs. Clerics</i><br><br>Here's where things get tricky.  The cleric is the one class that does not have an easily identifiable weakness to exploit.  When 1.64 comes around, you won't be able to dispell them as a rakshasa for the most part, so their buffs of death still stand.  They have a high AB, a high AC, and nasty spells to throw at you.<br><br>The best option in this case is dragon.  Just be prepared to duke it out for a bit... you can also try the breath weapon to take advantage of their low reflex saves.<br><br>If you don't have dragon, you're going to have an interesting time.  A cleric has high will saves and high fortitude saves, and you don't have much to take advantage of their low reflex saves (aside from dragon breath).<br><br>If true seeing is nerfed, you can try the kobold.  A cleric's high wisdom will generally mean a high spot/listen, however.<br><br>Rakshasa might be your best bet until 1.64.  If they're a multiclassed cleric, you can easily dispell their buffs to get rid of annoying things like Divine Power.  Watch out for blessed bolts though, which a cleric can make almost on demand.  One hit and you're dead, no save.<br><br>Barring rakshasa, the epic drow warrior might be best.  Its sword will break through any DR they can come up with, and your 30 SR will be useful against a heavily multiclassed cleric if they're feeling silly enough to try any spells against you.<br><br>The golems might also be a good idea.  A cleric/weaponmaster will be crippled somewhat by going up against an iron golem, since they won't get their crits in, for example.<br><br><i>Shifters vs. Undead</i><br><br>Construct and undead forms are your friends here.  Iron golem is great for pounding pierce/slash immune skeletons with its massive slams, while you don't have to worry about fear auras, level drain attacks, or death magic.  Risen lord is your best undead shape, unless you really need an AC boost from spectre (and invisibility for quick escapes).<br><br>If for some reason you lack undead and construct shapes, your next best bets are dragon or slaad.  The dragon is immune to mind effects, and the slaad is immune to fear so you don't have to worry about rolling a 1 in the middle of a bunch of auras.  The mindflayer is also immune to mind effects, but you'll have trouble doing much back to them in that form.<br><br>If fear isn't a concern, the azer chieftain can also dish out a good amount of damage.  The epic drow warrior's freeze effect still works on undead, so this is a good option as well.  If you need blunt damage and lack golems, the rakshasa's staff is always a good choice.<br><br><i>Exploiting weaknesses in saves</i><br><br>Your special abilities are your friends.  Know each one inside and out, and know what DCs you have with each.  Also remember that some weapons have special effects added onto them for added fun.<br><br>Special abilities for low will: vampire gaze, mindflayer blast, harpy's captivating song, lizardfolk's whip (with a stun effect on it).  Note that your vampire/mindflayer gaze gets a bonus to its DC if you have a higher wisdom.<br><br>Special abilities for low reflex: dragon breath, wyrmling breath, stone golem boulders.<br><br>Special abilities for low fortitude: basilisk/medusa gaze, spectre touch, iron golem poison (static DC 17 won't get much, though), kobold commando poisoned blade, epic drider poison spear, epic drow warrior freeze effect, medusa poison.<br><br><b>Summary</b><br><br>And so ends my little guide.  This is by NO means definitive, but hopefully it should give people some ideas on what to do with their shifters besides just slap a monk/shifter dragon together and fling it at people.  There are other options that will give you a versatile and powerful character that can really be a lot of fun to play.<br><br>I'm fairly certain that I'm not supposed to directly link to an FAQ on <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com" target="_blank">www.gamefaqs.com</a>, but there's a very nice FAQ on there dealing with shifters.  There are some errors in the guide (such as the spectre's touch attack, which is a fort save level drain, not a no save strength drain), but overall it's quite useful.  If you want numbers on all the forms, check there.  If you're ever in doubt of any of the information, test it yourself.<br><br>If there is anything you'd like me to expand on, anything I've goofed up on, anything you disagree with, anything you've found interesting or insightful, anything you think is stupid, anything that you think you can add, or... well... anything... feel free to share.<br><br>Hope this helped!<br>_________________<br>"Intelligence is knowing a tomato is a fruit; Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad."

An oddity of the class that in 1.63 form, but may be fixed in 1.64 (I dont know, but I doubt it). <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>You can take an Epic Shape feat at level 10 of Shifter (ie you dont need to be 11 levels or more; Epic).  All you need to do is take that 10th level on any general epic feat level; ie levels 21,24,27, etc, and meet the other feat pre-reqs.<br><br>This allows you (should you choose) to get all 4 Epic shape feats with only 13 levels of Shifter.  This can come in handy, like when you want to make a 5/13/22 Druid/Shifter/DwD with a little extra DR than the 5/17/18 version.<br>_________________<br>Normal kids play rock-paper-scissors.<br>Shifter kids play IronGolem-RustMonster-MindFlayer. . .
