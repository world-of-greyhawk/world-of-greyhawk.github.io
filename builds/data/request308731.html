I recall some dude reently asking me to give him suggestions for a lv 30 cleric (i cant remember if they are the same dude, but they must be playing the same server).  At least this guy on thi spost made some suggestions, unlike the dude that pmd me, who wanted me to pull things out of the air.  My point is, if you are going to help him, at least help him in the silliness he asks, or do what i usually do when people make suggestions like this and say: when you have restirctions like lv 30, since nwn isnt a new game and time is the most precious asset we have, FIND A NEW SERVER!  <br><br>In an very un-avado manner (i think my baby is having an affect on my attitude <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ) try here <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>    YES, its most of the epic builders, its just alot safer <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Well, fighter 12/WM 16/rogue 1 seems best...not sure where to stick the last level since without rogue being only at level 30, that's an experience penalty (unless he switches to halfling instead of gnome).  Either way, he's picking up one rogue level at the end to get 3 AC, 1d6 sneak attack, and UMD in exchange for 1 AB and 4 hp, basically.  But if he's already using a 2H, his AC isn't going to be all that hot.  UMD, depending on his server, might be worth it, though.  Might not be, probably is.  But if his server frowns on 1 rogue level at the end... *shrug*  Also hurts playability slightly since you don't get the tumble AC until level 30.<br><br>Oh, and I forgot the +1 AB/AC bonus for being small size.  So add another AB and AC.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Magical Master on 05/09/09 13:36</span></i></p>
