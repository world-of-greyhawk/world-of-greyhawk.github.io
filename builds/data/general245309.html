I'm thinking about a magewrecking paladin using the Holy Sword spell, but am unfortunately not around my computer, and have no access to NWN. So I'm reduced to working stuff out on pen and paper which, while some of you are extremely proficient, I cannot make good progress.<br><br>Anyway, what are the more in-depth properties of the Holy Sword spell, specifically:<br>What is the DC it has to dispel buffs?<br>What is its own DC to be dispelled?<br>What are the weapon parameters it can be cast on? Only the 'sword' subset, or all slashing, or all melee, or all weapons?<br>If I have a weapon with an enhancement bonus greater than +5, does HS override it and reduce it to +5, or does it add the other benefits and allow me to keep my more advantageous enhancement? <br><br>Going on with my magewrecker build, of a &gt;20 class Paladin (I've seen it mentioned around these forums that, at a certain class level, pally buffs are undispellable) with another multiclass.<br>Perhaps enough Cleric to get some good anti-magic spells (don't need to focus on offensive spells, because I'm planning for melee) and some CoT for feats and good synergy. <br><br>Looks like 20-something Pally, 15 cleric (for the lvl 8 spells Aura v. Alignment and Mass Heal, and a few CoT levels. Monk was discarded because there aren't enough levels available to develop good anti-magic abilities.<br><br>There are a lot of Pally-Cleric-CoT builds, but none really focus on Pally levels: the majority just graze lvl 15 to get Holy Sword.<br><br><br><br>PS: Also, is it possible to use a Quicken Spell feat on Holy Sword? It is a lvl 4 spell, and paladins don't have the feat available, but Clerics do, so...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Pb2Au on 06/28/06 02:36</span></i></p>

Crap, can't quote when I hit 'Reply'<br><br>Thanks for the amazingly fast response, and all the incredible information except for the part about dispel checks.<br><br>If no one is certain how dispel checks are affected by class levels in paladin, it compromises one of the main (read='only') reasons why I plan on so many Pally levels.

I assure you, if you find a holy avenger weapon, the number of Pally levels has nothing to do with dispel power. It is more your Class-level at least. And I think holysword gives the same effect.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

I've you're planning for PvP, make sure your server hasn't changed the Holy Sword spell.  It can be overpowering being able to strip a mage of all their buffs in a single lucky hit. <br><br>The server I play mostly has(unfortunately).

I am planning for PvP.<br>I don't believe they have nerfed it, mainly because it seems no one is aware of it. The PW I play is also pretty forgiving by way of nerfs. They've taken down the dmg of IGMS, removed Dev Crit, and put Hide in Plain Site as a Shadowdancer lvl 10 feat. But, other than that, they leave everything as it is.<br>Most people only multi-class to Pally when they are high-Charisma classes (especially Sorc) and then only to get the Saving Throw bonus. Also, the PW uses a subrace system with a lot of evil characters, so Pally is a rare class to take and an even more rare main class.<br>Still, thanks for the advice. I'll check. No good wasting time to level a broken character.<br>Any word on the ability to Quicken it using the Cleric feat Quicken Spell?

Quicken takes up a level higher(or more), and PAL don't have any slots higher than 4. But all metamagic feats works for all your caster-classes, as long as you have slots. But haste cancels out quicken anyhow, they don't stack. If your Cleric takes Travel domain, you're on.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

About undispellability: you need 25 lvls to be undispellable and remember that no matter your lvl you're still vulnerable to Mords.<br><br>Holy sword grants the holy avenger property to a weapon and holy avenger way of working is hard coded, there's no way to know for sure exactly how it functions. The last thread I read about it suggested that it's not the paladin lvl to matter but the character lvl.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?

OK, one more thing to clear up: are item buffs dispellable? Because if they are not, that instantly alleviates a lot of trouble for a magewrecker pretty much dependent on one buff.<br>Guess I'm going to have to spend an afternoon or so playing around in an instant-level module to test it out. I'll be back behind my own PC in 3 days, I'll report my findings of the Holy Sword spell and Holy Avenger property then.<br><br>My goal is to find a PvP pally build with<br>-High AB (Hopefully even 30 BAB @ lvl 40)<br>-Not smite dependent<br>-High DC Holy Sword (needs experimentation)<br><br><br>Considered multiclassing, in order of feasibility, is:<br>CoT<br>Fighter<br>Cleric<br>WM<br>DwD
