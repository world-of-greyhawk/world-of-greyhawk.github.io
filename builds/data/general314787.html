A joke build to answer the challenge of the "highest possible saves" build in getting higher saves.

I sent this to to someone in a PM..<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;: Sent 01/13/10 00:20 (GMT) by avado<br><br>Hey. This is a mock of the monk/bg/pal, and why you may want to make one. I dont have nwn installed any more and dont have the time. I will just cut and paste what i was gonna put in the newest build thread. Have fun!<br>---<br>A monk would have 12 to all saves at 20. If that monk were, say Charisma based with Paladin and BG2.. and say charisma could be 32 which is +11, at lv 40, you would have +22base +11 +11 = 44 to all saves. Add +12 to charisma, now you get +12 to saves (+6 pal +6 bg), and now your saves are 56. <br><br>Now, you have +20 to max cap, which LEGALLY puts your guy at 76. I used to play a server where all 40s walkd around with +10 universal saves, so 66/66/66. Which isnt too shabby (and if you can find it, +10 more to add). Add in LoH, and you have 67! <br><br>The problem with this guy is, very poor ab and damage, though may not be too bad. Definitly, not a power build! If your purpose is to get high saves, then 20 monk pre is essential. Definitely not a build i would want to play through.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I DIDN NOT SEND IT TO WHIZ!  Looks like great minds think alike!  And thanks for putting flesh to the idea, cuz i just didnt have the patience!  LOL
