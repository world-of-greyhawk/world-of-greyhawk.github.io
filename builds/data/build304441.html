Since wizard is favored class of elf, the xp penalty will only be 20%, and it will start at lvl 5. Had you chosen human or half elf, there would not be any xp penalty before lvl 17. <br>I understand Tensor counts as elf, so you will probably have an xp penalty as an elf while transformed. But you won't be able to cast tenser before epic levels unless you have access to scrolls. So probably most of the pre epic play will be unshifted.<br><br>I wonder what the ranger part brings to the build other than stealth skills and the feat at lvl 5? You can get that feat if you take just one ranger lvl in epic. And you will avoid most of the xp penalty if you take it late.<br>Taking straight Barb/Wizard avoids the xp penalty and let you take an epic wizard bonus feat.<br><br>Ps. This is a crazy build, really something special! I am tempted <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"><br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

Why not rogue instead of ranger?  With hasted tenser you get 7 APR giving a lot of attacks after a knockdown to get sneak damage added.  Also why so high a strength if tenser will just decrease it to 20 anyway.  Thundering Rage isn't worth the stat investment.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By WhiZard on 03/15/09 04:58</span></i></p>
