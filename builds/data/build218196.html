A wisdom monk/cleric who mostly takes combat feats and grabs a rogue level at the end... it doesn't seem to make much sense.</b><br>A:  My philosophy behind the build was to build a reasonably self-sufficient buffing and healing cleric with a workable buffed melee capability, workable ranged capability, 9th level divine spellcasting, and strong personal defenses.  The rogue level adds a midget sneak attack, but is actually there as a skill dump for utility purposes.<br><br>The character is mainly meant for low magic worlds where his buffs will bring his AB more or less in line with characters on the 3/4 AB progression.<br><br><b>Q:  Why focus on self sufficiency and defense though?  Why not build for more offense via buffed melee with a focus on dex or strength for AB?</b><br>A:  The character's overall concept is that of a wandering holy man or wise sage who isn't necessarily out to kill enemies so much as avoid being killed while helping others.  He's got a base DC 40 stunning fist he can use 20 times a day to disable an opponent without killing them, though he'll almost surely have to buff up to land it.<br><br>He makes a good teammate because he can handle aggro reasonably well while providing front line healing support and aura buff/debuff spells like Holy Aura and Battletide.<br><br><b>Q:  Why go for rogue skills in a party player?  Won't parties have rogues?</b><br>A:  Not necessarily, and having a capability is always better than not having it.<br><br><b>Q:  Why not take more caster levels at the expense of Monk?</b><br>A:  It's very possible to go 23 cleric/16 monk/1 rogue in this build.  This will get you a cleric epic bonus feat while preserving the 1d20 monk damage dice if you don't want to use a kama, but it costs you a point of monk bonus AC, some movement speed, empty body, and immunity to mind spells.<br><br>I felt empty body freeing you from memorizing improved invisibilities, but more important the other monk bonuses, were worthwhile comparatively.<br><br><b>Q:  Why not focus in a ranged weapon?</b><br>A:  In a medium or high magic environment you probably should.  In a low magic environment, combining kama focus with your buff magic can let your melee power catch up to other characters, giving you a broader capability and more options in combat.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 10/30/05 23:15</span></i></p>

'Nother interesting build, Xylo.  You've been quite prolific as of late.  This is what I deem to be a Niche Character.  In other words, I wished all my parties had a player who had the patience and discipline to play a hard to hit Healer/Buff Supporter.  There is a market for such things, as we once had a player who had an Epic Dodging Healer/Buff Provider with high AC.  We liked him.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 10/28/05 01:28:29 (GMT) -- Xylophone<br><br><b>Q:  Why not take more caster levels at the expense of Monk?</b><br>A:  It's very possible to go 23 cleric/16 monk/1 rogue in this build.

The 1 AC is easily replaced, there are more than enough Improved Invis's from Trickery Domain(supported by max spellslot power and 30 natural Wis) to replace Empty Body, and with a 35 Will, how worried can one really be about Mind-affecting spells?<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I've got a big backlog of builds from when I wasn't connected to the net but still had NWN to keep me busy... especially monk builds, since doing creative things with monk is a build-hobby of mine. I save posting them for days when I have the time to write the explanations and hopefully a story for them.  I think this thread would really benefit from having a story because the build is very RP-ish, and hopefully I'll get around to making one for it soon.<br><br>By shedding enough monk levels for cleric and rearranging some combat feats towards casting feats, you can have a somewhat effective casting offense if you want.  You probably would come out ahead on raw power that way.<br><br>I just envisoned him as a wandering monk with cleric powers to heal and defend, and a versatile, if subpar outside of a lowmagic world, offense.  My monk bias showing - I felt if I didn't take enough monk levels it would stop being a monk build and start being a cleric build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
