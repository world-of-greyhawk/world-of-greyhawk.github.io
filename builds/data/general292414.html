I have been doing a little reading on the Blackguard class and noticed that there spells are Wisdom based.  I have noticed this because I was thinking of building this guy here: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "208450", "0", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br><br>   So, would this character be able to cast Blackguard spells?  If not why the Blackguard class?<br><br>   Also I have noticed that most of the Blackguard builds not even bother with WIS.  Is this because the spells suck?  Why are there no WIS based Blackguards out there?  Why are there so many high lvl Blackguards with no WIS?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Krylocke

In NWN, the blackguard spells are granted as class-specific feats. No Wisdom required, and a high WIS score does not affect the spells.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

WIS is as useful for a Blackguard as it is for a Fighter: bonus to Will save, and that's it dude.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
