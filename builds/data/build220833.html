Reducing STR to 15 at the start, you can set WIS to 14, getting you effective 1 stat-point more. You don't have to increase WIS twice during level-up and can free one of the Greater STR feats to take something else.

seems to be ranger/fighter build weekend.  nicely done.  i think that it was mentioned to drop strength and boost wis.  otherwise, looks like a solid build.  nothing stands out.<br><br>well done.  i wish for more DD levels for some DR, but i guess being among pointy ears will do that do a dwarf. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>also, you will have to change weapons to go sword and board.  just in case anyone doesn't catch that.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Perception is strong and sight weak.

Thanks for the feedback.  I really appreciate the change to Str and Wis.  That's a great spot. Also re the choice of weapon, feel free to change the specialization to fit you style and PW.  To Dual Wield you wont be able to wear heavy armor, so that will affect your AC as your dex isn't great. Cat's Grace will help a little.<br><br>I had also thought of changing to Ftr4/Dwd6 and here is the build I came up with.
