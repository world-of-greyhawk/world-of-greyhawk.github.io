Hi there, im looking for a melee fighter build with atleast 18 levels of monk in it. He will be using a spear as main weapon, thus he need to be Strength based.<br><br>I was thinking maybe 18 monk, 7 wm, 15 fighter or something similiar. On the server I play, speed is important for this character due to roleplaying reasons, so he will be using  cloth armor, thus having a positive Dexterity and Wisdon modifier is always nice!<br><br>Devastating critical is not something im looking for here, <br><br>Fortitude is very important on the server I play, so he should atleast take Luck of Heroes, Great fort. and Epic fort.

sounds like your already on the right track.  follow your own advice and see where your char takes you.  if this is a RP char, then you don't really need help with it, it will evolve as you go.<br><br>-c

Thanks for the reply, however. I suck at creating characters, I just want help with the leveling order. I really dont understand the NWN system at how it words with XP penalty and bonus feat and that kind of things, your are the experts, I just need some help.<br><br>I tried modyfing this build <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "202161", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>But it ended up with only 3 attacks/round. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br>Anybody?

Why don't you post the build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> ?<br><br>But instead of modifying a dual-wielding kama build, why don't you start with a other weapon than kama using, no dual-wielding monk/fighter/weapon master?<br><br>I made such a <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "207643", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>build</a> myself a while ago (katana and less monk levels however), but there are many other builds.

Hi Kamiryn, thanks for the reply and info. <br><br>I just checked that build of yours, the Kensai. It looks great and very promising. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br><br>Just one thing it missed was the 18 levels of monk which would have granted me the empy body thingy. However, it looks like it might just work without! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br><br>EDIT: I read that you said you arent so happy with the build after level 24 and it could be changed. At what levels past 24 could I squeze in 5 extra monk levels without loosing to much stuff from the WM levels?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Zanzalar on 01/17/06 12:46</span></i></p>

Unhappy is the wrong word, it just that at level 24 my build had all the things I wanted. <br><br>By taking only 14 WM levels you would lose 2 AB and 2 WM bonus feats. Since from WM level 8-14 you gain only +1 to AB and a WM bonus feat perhaps I would take 7 WM levels only and take more fighter levels instead.<br><br>You could go for Monk(18)/Fighter(6)/WM(16) as well. You don't need so many fighter levels pre-epic because you don't need the Exotic Weapon Prof. feat. Perhaps Monk(8)/Fighter(4)/WM(8) pre-epic. But that would be different build then - but perhaps a better starting point for you.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.Detail&amp;id=856" target="_blank">Character Build Calculator</a>(works with Excel, Open Office) 2.83: updated to NWN 1.69.
