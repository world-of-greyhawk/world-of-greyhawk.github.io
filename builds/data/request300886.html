Ok so I was looking at grizzled_dwarflord 's build <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "255551", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> The War Machine of Gruumsh</a> (Nice build btw) and it got me thinking that it needs a harper scout buddy that is more focused on casting. I don't play on any pw's as I never have time and I love solo'ing also I've never given in to the urge to play a cleric so I basically I need help refining this cleric heavy, barb/cleric/h.s. so that it is both playable and effective. <br>I've tossed this guy together with the cbc ....<br><br>	<br>Barbarian(4), Cleric(31), Harper Scout(5), Half-Orc<br><br>STR: 14 (18)<br>DEX: 10 (12)<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 14 (20)<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 10<br><br>Half-Orc: (Darkvision)<br>01: Barbarian(1): Blind Fight<br>02: Cleric(1): Domain Magic, Domain Healing<br>03: Cleric(2): Silent Spell<br>04: Cleric(3): WIS+1, (WIS=15)<br>05: Cleric(4)<br>06: Cleric(5): Empower Spell<br>07: Cleric(6)<br>08: Cleric(7): WIS+1, (WIS=16)<br>09: Cleric(8): Maximize Spell<br>10: Cleric(9)<br>11: Cleric(10)<br>12: Cleric(11): WIS+1, Quicken Spell, (WIS=17)<br>13: Barbarian(2): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>14: Cleric(12)<br>15: Cleric(13): Alertness<br>16: Cleric(14): WIS+1, (WIS=18)<br>17: Cleric(15)<br>18: Barbarian(3): Iron Will<br>19: Cleric(16)<br>20: Cleric(17): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br>21: Harper Scout(1): Epic Prowess, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=11)<br>22: Harper Scout(2)<br>23: Barbarian(4)<br>24: Cleric(18): WIS+1, Automatic Silent Spell I, (WIS=20)<br>25: Cleric(19)<br>26: Cleric(20)<br>27: Harper Scout(3): Epic Reflexes<br>28: Cleric(21): STR+1, (STR=15)<br>29: Cleric(22)<br>30: Cleric(23): Automatic Silent Spell II, Automatic Quicken Spell I<br>31: Cleric(24)<br>32: Harper Scout(4): STR+1, (STR=16)<br>33: Cleric(25): Automatic Silent Spell III<br>34: Cleric(26): Automatic Quicken Spell II<br>35: Cleric(27)<br>36: Cleric(28): STR+1, Automatic Quicken Spell III, (STR=17)<br>37: Harper Scout(5): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=12)<br>38: Cleric(29): Armor Skin<br>39: Cleric(30): Toughness<br>40: Cleric(31): STR+1, (STR=18)<br><br>Hitpoints: 406<br>Skillpoints: 196<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 24/28/21<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +2<br>BAB: 25<br>AB (max, naked): 30 (melee), 27 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 21/32<br>Spell Casting: Cleric(9)<br>Alignment Changes: 0<br><br>Concentration 43(44), Discipline 40(44), Heal 8(13), Lore 6(13), Persuade 8(8), Search 4(6), Spellcraft 43(45), Tumble 40(41)<br><br>So yeah he's rough I know, anyways is the auto-quicken line really needed?

Well, first of all, the title is pretty bad... because it says nothing at all. I don't know the rest of the people but I don't understand what H/O means, (maybe that's just me since English is not my first language, but I still find the title very awkward).<br><br>You said yourself that it's hard to mess up a Cleric build...<br><br>Alright, you want harsh, I'll be harsh:<br><br>So, why do you take 4 Barbarian? it seems totally useless. 4 Fighter gives good feats and possible EWS. 4 Monk gives a lot of Monk-ish abilities. 4 Shadowdancer gives HiPS. 4 Bard gives a good skillset. 4 Barbarian gives probably nothing, it's better to get Uncanny Dodge taking Rogue levels. If you're going to say you take Barbarian for the RP effect of being a Barbarian then you don't really need any criticism.<br><br>Alright, I'll try to be useful now:<br><br>Automatic Quicken Spell is a very useless feat, or rather, a very useless line of feats. It makes the same effect as Haste (allow you to cast 2 times per round) and it won't stack with Haste, so get Haste and all the Quicken Spell becomes trash. <br><br>Automatic Silent spell isn't so bad, but it's a very big feat investment. A buffed Cleric has no need for that.<br><br>Cleric Domains: The best Domain is Trickery because it gives you Improved Invisibility, which gives 50% Concealment with a good duration (1 turn per level). There is absolutely no good reason not to take Trickery, no matter what type of Cleric you're building, 50% Concealment is extremely powerful. Another good Domain can be Travel, because it gives you Haste. If you can get items with permanent Haste then don't take Travel. Personally, I like Plant Domain to get Barkskin but most people like War Domain to get Aura of Vitality.<br><br>Your stats are terrible, seriously. You're taking Half-Orc which lowers your INT and CHA but increases STR. You should only take Half-Orc when you want a high STR no-INT no-CHA melee fighter. Along with that idea, you don't need CHA at all, it's useless for your classes. Lower it as much as you can. Human is advisable.<br><br>You take Epic Prowess but no Weapon Focus. That's a mistake IMO. Weapon Focus and Epic Weapon Focus will boost your AB by +3, you're already taking useless feats like the quickening so you have space for that. If you go Human you also get an extra pre-epic feat.<br><br>If you're planning on fighting in melee grab some Great Strength feats.<br><br>I think that should cover all the important things.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 09/05/08 01:28</span></i></p>

Truth be told, I think Undead Turning is pretty useless too, so the fact is I don't know how to strengthen it. At any rate, it's a big mistake to take Half-orc and trying to have a good CHA and INT score, you end losing stat points doing that. Having 14 INT is pretty bad too. INT is useful alright but with the penalty for Half-Orc you're spending 10 points to start with 14 INT, the same you would need to start with 18 STR. You need to master the opportunity cost to make good choices.<br><br>By the way, Shadowdancer won't get XP penalty anyway, it's a Prestige Class.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/28/06 23:16:09 (GMT) -- Big Meph<br>Using the 2 ESF's in a dex based sneak build, <i>to me</i>, just looks like you're teasing your diabetic opponent with extra sugar on your whipcream covered chocolate mudcake.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 09/05/08 04:22</span></i></p>

OH MY GOD!  <br><br>First, a cleric CANNOT be messed up, as long as you take wisdom to 20.  That allows you to cast all your spells, and that is all you really need.  <br><br>I think Thax is being too easy!  OMG you took 2 sets of AUTO spell feats!  I dont think in all my years of playing that i have EVER seen a build do that, EVER! See, with a cleric, you generally dont require auto spell feats.  You can cast in armor, so still isnt needed (as auto).  You have spells vs silence so not needed.  YOu have or can have haste, so no quicken.  THere is a reason to take still OR silent spell, and the ONLY reason for a cleric is to cast heals or harms one spell slot higher = more harms/heals than you would normally have.  THat is IT!<br><br>TO take auto silent is unforgivable!  UNFORGIVABLE!  Auto quicken is a pw thing, but mostly a waste of 4 feats.  That is 8 wasted feats in one build that doesnt get too many feats as it is!  <br><br>Trying to copy griz's build with barb/cleric, while admirable, you have MURDERED the original intent of that build.  Griz's build is a masterpiece (i used it with variation myself (used prc classes)).  You some how succeeded in making an amazing build garbage!  <br><br>Thax took care of the uselessness of the feats.  What truly worries me is how useless your stats are!  You actually bump 3?  dude, i think even the worst character builder ever designed (biowares Recommend button) would never choose 3 stat increases (unless you somehow chose 3 different classes on stat bump levels!).  Be epic and make a stand... str or wisdom?  what are you doin with dex!!  I know  but man!  find an item with 2 dex!  or dont worry bout it!  its -1 ac!<br><br>You asked for comments.  After seeing your pitiful excuses vs Thax's comments, i expect the same here.   Be a man dude.  IF you are going to mix cleric with harper, at least have a reason!  If you posted one, i apologize!  I dont take anyone seriously who makes up such nonsense then tries to defend it vs sound suggestions.  <br><br>All this said, there is something to be said for the power of the cleric class.  Cuz at the end of the day, the class will make this build playable!  It has NOTHING at all to do with how you designed the build. It is just how powerful a 20+ cleric is.  <br><br>I apologize for the on topic rant, but i really cant stand a dude who makes garbage then tries to justify it via rp...  in my mind, a cleric could NEVER rp autosilent!  I know you are new, but please dont ask for input then try to ignore the suggestions!<br><br>oh, turning undead iirc has to do with charisma too.

I'll answer the last part on trickery. Yes. It's still a training required class, so you need 1pt. Of course, with a neg charisma modifier, I'd probably move away from counting on that domain anyway. Go with two that don't require charisma. Unless you just want improved invis and don't care about the skill boost.

You're rough as usual avado. New guys can't stand so much hate. In our powerbuilding minds Concept never beats Power. It's not fun to play a weak character and get owned IMO, but I'm far tired from trying to make people believe it, so don't be so head straight intolerant with newbies.<br><br>Truth be told I do believe taking Harper Scout on a STR based Cleric is really bad. I once made a Cleric / Harper Scout / Monk which was a very crazy attempt of super buffs, increasing AC with DEX, WIS and CHA buffs, but in the end I didn't post it because it was kinda weak.<br><br>I was very specific about why it's a bad idea to raise INT and CHA in a Half-Orc, but I'm already through with that, it's your problem to believe me or not. Raising DEX is also a class problem. You're taking Great DEX as HS bonus feats, which yeah it's useless, but so the whole class. I won't recommend to change the build RP idea because that never works. <br><br>Empower Spell and Maximize Spell are pretty nice, I usually take those two. Yeah, only those two. The new build looks better but Epic Spells are not good investments. The good Epic Spells are only available for Sorcerer and Wizard.<br><br>Raising WIS to 22 isn't very wise either. You need 19 to cast all the spells, but if you're not a main caster then that +1 DC won't make a difference. My theory is that specialization makes your build stronger (it works for like 95% of the cases), so focus in Wisdom and go caster or focus in Strength and go meleer, but if you try half and half you will half-suck in both. You have extra epic feats for Great STR or Great WIS because you should really drop the epic spells.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 05/09/08 07:26 (GMT) -- avado<br><br>THax, you know i love and respect you, right?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 09/06/08 00:36</span></i></p>

I want to add my voice to those advising against a Half-Orc Barbarian / Cleric / Harper Scout. That said, how about this for a compromise build? It should be more playable, while still hopefully fitting your role-playing concept.<br><br>If you know you will not have access to a perma-haste item, like Boots of Speed, then take Travel domain instead of Magic. The build will gain some playability, but lose some style, if you replace those 2 epic spells with 2 more Great Strength. You might consider replacing those 2 Great Dexterity feats with a couple Favored Enemies, but I don't know which enemies to choose. Even though Barbarian does not get Heavy Armor proficiency, he does not suffer any penalty at all if you get it somewhere else (like from Cleric) and wear some. Without Concentration, you simply cast your long-lasting buffs before you enter an area where you might have combat, and forgo short-duration buffs, unless you get a chance to cast them just before you round a corner into combat.<br><br>If you want, I could build you a Human Fighter / Cleric / Harper Scout that would be a more powerful build.<br><br><b>Barbarian(9), Cleric(26), Harper Scout(5)</b><br>Half-Orc, Non-Lawful, Non-Evil<br>Playable 1-40, PvM<br><br><i>Abilities:</i><br>STR: 18 (28)<br>DEX: 8 (10)<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 16 (20)<br>INT: 10<br>CHA: 6<br><br><i>Leveling Guide:</i><br>Half-Orc: (Darkvision)<br>01: Barbarian(1): Weapon Focus: Greataxe<br>02: Cleric(1): Domain Magic, Domain Trickery<br>03: Cleric(2): Blind Fight<br>04: Cleric(3): STR+1, (STR=19)<br>05: Cleric(4)<br>06: Cleric(5): Extend Spell<br>07: Cleric(6)<br>08: Cleric(7): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>09: Cleric(8): Power Attack<br>10: Cleric(9)<br>11: Cleric(10)<br>12: Cleric(11): WIS+1, Cleave, (WIS=17)<br>13: Barbarian(2): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>14: Cleric(12)<br>15: Cleric(13): Iron Will<br>16: Cleric(14): WIS+1, (WIS=18)<br>17: Cleric(15)<br>18: Cleric(16): Alertness<br>19: Barbarian(3)<br>20: Cleric(17): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br>21: Harper Scout(1): Epic Weapon Focus: Greataxe, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=9)<br>22: Harper Scout(2)<br>23: Barbarian(4)<br>24: Cleric(18): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=21)<br>25: Cleric(19)<br>26: Cleric(20)<br>27: Harper Scout(3): Great Strength I, (STR=22)<br>28: Cleric(21): STR+1, (STR=23)<br>29: Cleric(22)<br>30: Cleric(23): Great Strength II, Armor Skin, (STR=24)<br>31: Cleric(24)<br>32: Harper Scout(4): STR+1, (STR=25)<br>33: Barbarian(5): Great Strength III, (STR=26)<br>34: Barbarian(6)<br>35: Barbarian(7)<br>36: Cleric(25): STR+1, Epic Spell: Greater Ruin, (STR=27)<br>37: Harper Scout(5): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=10)<br>38: Barbarian(8)<br>39: Cleric(26): Epic Spell: Hellball, Great Wisdom I, (WIS=20)<br>40: Barbarian(9): STR+1, (STR=28)<br><br><i>Stats:</i><br>Hitpoints: 426<br>Skillpoints: 120<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 25/28/16<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +3<br>BAB: 25<br>AB (max, naked): 38 (melee), 26 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 20/31<br>Spell Casting: Cleric(9)<br>Alignment Changes: 0<br><br><i>Skills:</i><br>Disable Trap 1(1), Discipline 4(13), Lore 14(19), Open Lock 1(1), Persuade 8(6), Pick Pocket 1(1), Search 4(4), Spellcraft 40(40), Tumble 40(40)<br><br>01: Disable Trap(1), Discipline(4), Lore(3), Open Lock(1), Pick Pocket(1), Save(3), <br>02: Spellcraft(5)<br>03: Lore(1), Spellcraft(1)<br>04: Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1)<br>05: Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1)<br>06: Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1)<br>07: Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1)<br>08: Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1)<br>09: Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1)<br>10: Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1)<br>11: Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1)<br>12: Lore(1), Spellcraft(1)<br>13: Lore(1), Search(1), Save(1)<br>14: Spellcraft(2), Save(1)<br>15: Search(1), Spellcraft(1)<br>16: Spellcraft(1), Save(1)<br>17: Search(1), Spellcraft(1)<br>18: Spellcraft(1), Save(1)<br>19: Search(1), Save(3)<br>20: Spellcraft(2), Save(3)<br>21: Tumble(7)<br>22: Tumble(4)<br>23: Save(4)<br>24: Spellcraft(4), Save(2)<br>25: Spellcraft(1), Save(3)<br>26: Spellcraft(1), Save(4)<br>27: Tumble(8)<br>28: Spellcraft(2)<br>29: Spellcraft(1), Save(1)<br>30: Spellcraft(1), Save(2)<br>31: Spellcraft(1), Save(3)<br>32: Tumble(7)<br>33: Save(4)<br>34: Save(8)<br>35: Save(12)<br>36: Spellcraft(4), Save(10)<br>37: Tumble(14)<br>38: Lore(4)<br>39: Spellcraft(2)<br>40: Lore(4)<br>_________________<br>Great Research Tools:<br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWNWiki</a><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">NWN Epic Character Build Search Engine</a><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/" target="_blank">The NWN Vault</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Empyre65 on 09/06/08 04:45</span></i></p>

I know griz did 4 in his build (iirc) but i find that once you get the cleric going, things dont last realy long for barbarian feats.  And, with a max ab boost, is the rage really worth it?  imvho, no.

What about Assassin to avoid a xp penalty, but which requires skill investment to get?  Take a feat like still spell with a class that can cast in full plate and tower shield ONLY to cast certain useful spells one slot higher?  Things like that.

I would give up the idea of 26 Cleric altogether and instead go Cleric20/Barb15/HS5.  Grab TR and then use HS bonus feats for ESF: Intimidate and Taunt.  Since you'll get  your Strength buffs via Rage, take Trickery and Travel, ala The Shifty One-Eyed Terrible Raging War Machine of the One-Eyed Gruumsch (hey, orc chicks did the long titles <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  )<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
