I have recently uncovered the full (or so far as lengthy playtesting fully supports) application of the commands EffectDispelMagicBest() and EffectDispelMagicAll() and have posted them in the <a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Dispel" target="_blank">wiki</a>.<br><br>This is significant as there is a slight difference to common formula given in game, as well as an indication of all exception effects.<br><br>Chiefly this has the impact that immunity (mostly) to greater dispel starts at class level 24 (not 25). Also, that a few spells that are cast (like true seeing) are easily dispellable no matter what caster level they are cast at.<br><br>If anyone finds this confusing please let me know.<br>_________________<br>Can't find henchman or creature?<br><br>DebugMode 1<br>.

Slight update as DispelMagicBest() doesn't use the exclusion list that DispelMagicAll() uses.  I also reformatted the conditions.<br><br>As for the following effects:<br>Curse<br>Concealment<br>See Invisibility<br>Spell Failure<br>Trueseeing<br><br>these can be prevented from defaulting to zero simply by linking them to another effect (one that won't default to zero).  This is done in-game with many standard spells by linking them to a visual effect (VFX_DUR_CESSATE_POSITIVE is most commonly used).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By WhiZard on 02/09/10 14:24</span></i></p>
