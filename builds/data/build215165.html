Eric and his sister Gwennith were of the ages 8 and 9.  They were happy children and were raised by loving parents.  Their father owned a large area of land on the outskirts of the Kingdom of Eidelon.  He was a farmer and his wife a clothier.  Soon, their picture perfect life was about to change…<br><br>	King Arelon was not known for his kindness and ruled his land with an iron glove.  Wealth was his most important asset.  It seemed that being rich and king of the land was not enough so he decided to expand his kingdom.  His plans required that a particular farm needed to be removed to make way for a warriors training arena and other bastions of war.<br><br>	The king and his guards traveled to the small farm house, and demanded the family uproot and leave.  Eric’s father refused and without hesitation Arelon killed him where he stood.  As Eric stared at his now lifeless father, he realized he and his sister were in danger.  The guards had already restrained his mother and were moving towards him.  He quickly evaded the guards, ran upstairs and grabbed his little sister and they made way out the window and into a nearby forest.  Eric heard his mother scream one last time before all was silent.  He wanted to stop running, give up, and cry for his parents but he knew he could not.  He had to save his sister.  She had no knowledge of the events that took place other than the screaming and he had no desire to tell her.<br><br>	They made their way into the forest but the King’s guards were behind them, hunting dogs in pursuit.  Eric found a somewhat hidden cave within a large tree.  He and his sister crawled in hoping that whatever may be inside was safer than the guards chasing them.<br><br>	Eric told his sister to stay inside and he went back out to try and lure the guards away but it was too late.  They grabbed Eric as soon as he exited the cave.  The guards laughed and started wagering on how long Eric could survive a mauling by the dogs when suddenly the quick sound of a blade removed from its sheath was heard but only by Eric.  Moments later, one of the guards fell silent as if he had just died for no reason.  The other 3 soon realized they were not alone, for as the guards lifeless body fell, so did his head from his shoulders.  Seemingly out of nowhere a figure appeared in front of Eric.  It was human but dark as if a shadow had come to life.  The guard holding Eric soon screeched in pain as his arms came lose from his body, freeing Eric from his grasp.<br><br>	The last two guards began to attack the shadowy figure but they could not seem to hit him.  Steel and sweat seemed to pass right through him as if he did not exist.  Yes, his dagger was real enough to make quick work of them.<br><br>	Eric wanted to run, to scream, to do something, but he stood there knowing he was the last thing alive protecting his sister.  The figure kneeled down and looked at Eric.  He grabbed his shoulder and spoke, “You have been through a lot today young one.  Perhaps you and your sister could use some rest.”<br><br>	Eric and Gwennith were led deeper into the forest until they came to what seemed to be a stone wall.  The figure then pressed upon the stone and soon it opened up offering passage within.  They entered the cave and Eric thought that the dwelling was quite comfortable considering it was carved out of rock. <br><br> The shadow, as Eric came to call him, explained that he had seen what happened to his parents and had followed him and the guards.  While he usually never interferes with common citizens of the land, he saw a quality in Eric that made him something special.  He had great agility, even for a child and endurance and cunning.  Eric eventually became the Shadow’s student.  Since he had no one left, he took him in and trained Eric in the arts of stealth and blade.  In the meantime, the Shadow took Gwennith to a small village and had found a family willing to raise her as their own.<br><br>After several years, Eric became a master of the Shadows.  He too could glide in and out of sight, seemingly bending light to his will.  He would often visit his sister and was ultimately her guardian angel.<br><br>By the age of 22, Eric could no longer stand his nightmares.  He went to his sister and said, “I can never forget the look of our father’s face when he was killed that day.  I can always hear our mother’s scream, the howling dogs, and the cackling guards.  I will extract revenge and lay these ghosts to rest so I too can sleep again.”  Gwennith pleaded for Eric to stay but he had already disappeared before her very eyes…<br><br>It was not long before word got out of the king’s assassination.  While only a few had witnessed the aftermath, reports were of a violent, almost inhumane murdering of the king.  No one was caught or seen the night it happened but Gwennith knew.  She also knew Eric could never show his face in the kingdom again.  <br><br>Gwennith spent the rest of her years in peace and happiness.  She got married, had children, and eventually moved back to her parent’s old farmhouse.  While she never saw Eric again, face to face, she could feel him.  She knew she was being watched over, but more importantly, she knew her brother loved her.

I honestly never thought about using Imp Expertise with an SC V/ E.Dodge build... nice touch and yes 81 AC with the stuff you got isn't rare but nice... I've built Cleric/ Monks with more and let's not talk about Dragon shifters but this is a nice change... only thing he's vunerable to is Timestop/ IGMS...<br><br>LOVED THE STORY TOO!!!!

Thanks for the comments.  Glad you enjoyed the story.  I forgot to factor in Uncanny Dodge 3 which gives an extra +2 to reflex saves.  Also, you can take UMD and drop heal or whatever you like.  I never factor it in since the PW I play in caps UMD to class level(where UMD is a class skill) + skill focus + 3 + cha mod.
