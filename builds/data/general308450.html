Hello there, I just had a quick question about the behind the scenes stats of dragon shape that I couldn't get answered from the wikipage.<br><br>The +6claws and the -2 penalty to ac and ab for being big fatty lizards, are these taken accounted for in the character sheet.  Here's a quick example.<br><br>I made a cleric dragon with 87ac and 67 ab (outside +2).<br>Now is the penalty shown or do I have to figure it myself, same goes for the +6 enchantment with claws. Giving me really 85 ac and 71 ab?<br><br>Any help on the matter would be appreciated, <br>thank you<br>=D

WF and EWF unarmed shows up on the sheet, but does nothing. Epic Prowess works. Claws +6 does, as I said, not show up. Neither does -2 from size.<br><br>Your AC is probably 85, your AB 71. Unless you have taken the WF and EWF feats, then your AB will be 68.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

My advise is never trust the character sheet for any shifted stats, test your AB with the feedback rolls, it's easy to read, and your AC is probably easiest to just make the math.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
