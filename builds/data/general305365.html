By the way, Devastating Critical doesn't work either, though I recall reading Overwhelming Critical does but I've never checked, it's not worth it, yeah weird.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

I got another question: If I decide to go Weapon Master / Shifter and use the Risen Lord form, choosing my Weapon of choice as a SCYTHE, do the WM bonuses apply while shifted? I mean technically it's a regular weapon, so it should work, but does it? Would be cool if it did <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Take it EZ!

Yes, I believe it still works that way. I'm sure there is a build or two in the search engine that uses that combo.

I've said it before, if you want to know something about shifters, try searching Bromium's builds in the index, he has more shifter than anybody.
