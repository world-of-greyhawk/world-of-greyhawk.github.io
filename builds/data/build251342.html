Story:<br>Rip lingered over his most recent victim relishing the kill.  Snickering and drooling he expertly clips off the left thumb to add to his "collection" of mumified appendeges he hangs off his belt and around his neck. "Too easy, too easy," he thinks.  His pet rat, Nip, sqeaks for his share.  "Otay, little Nipper, Rip get you yours."  Taking off the right hand of the fresh corps he throws it to the filthy rat.  "Nipper, dinner, dinner," Rip squels, as the eager and hungry rat chomps away.  <br><br>Rip sits atop the still warm body pondering, "Pft, humans no like us Nip.  Says Rip all smelly and green and ugly. Rip show em, Rip show em good."  His sharp kobold ears pick up the clinking of metal boots on cobblestones, "Nip, hide, another one."  Rip fades into the darkness awaiting his next victim.  A smile grows over the miserable creature's distorted face as he realizes the humans will never catch him.<br><br>Druid(5), Shifter(7), Blackguard(28)<br>Gnome, Neutral Evil<br>Playable 1-40 PvM, untested PvP<br><br>STR: 15 (30)<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 10<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>01: Druid(1): Alertness<br>02: Druid(2)<br>03: Druid(3): Power Attack,  <br>04: Druid(4): STR+1, (STR=16)<br>05: Druid(5)<br>06: Shifter(1): Cleave<br>07: Shifter(2)<br>08: Shifter(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>09: Shifter(4): Knockdown<br>10: Shifter(5)<br>11: Shifter(6)<br>12: Shifter(7): STR+1, Improved Knockdown, (STR=18)<br>13: Blackguard(1)<br>14: Blackguard(2): BG: (Smite Good)<br>15: Blackguard(3): Weapon Focus: Shortsword<br>16: Blackguard(4): STR+1, (STR=19)<br>17: Blackguard(5)<br>18: Blackguard(6): Improved Critical: Shortsword<br>19: Blackguard(7)<br>20: Blackguard(8): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>21: Blackguard(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Shortsword,  <br>22: Blackguard(10)<br>23: Blackguard(11)<br>24: Blackguard(12): STR+1, Great Cleave,(STR=21)<br>25: Blackguard(13): Armor Skin<br>26: Blackguard(14)<br>27: Blackguard(15): Great Strength I,(STR=22)<br>28: Blackguard(16): STR+1, Epic Fiendish Servant, (STR=23)<br>29: Blackguard(17)<br>30: Blackguard(18): Great Strength II, (STR=24)<br>31: Blackguard(19): Overwhelming Critical: Shortsword<br>32: Blackguard(20): STR+1, (STR=25)<br>33: Blackguard(21): Great Strength III, (STR=26)<br>34: Blackguard(22): Epic Toughness I<br>35: Blackguard(23):  <br>36: Blackguard(24): STR+1, Great Strength IV, (STR=28)<br>37: Blackguard(25): Improved Sneak Attack I<br>38: Blackguard(26):  <br>39: Blackguard(27): Great Strength V, (STR=29)<br>40: Blackguard(28): STR+1, Improved Sneak Attack II, (STR=30)<br><br><br>Hitpoints: 396<br>Skillpoints: 202<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 24/19/18<br>BAB: 26<br>AB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 28 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 17/24<br>Spell Casting: Druid(3)<br><br>Animal Empathy 15(14), Heal 32(34), Hide 21(22), Move Silently 19(20), Open Lock 21(22), Tumble 15(16)<br><br>This is a strength build with 11d6 sneaks (and a little extra umph from overwhelming crit), improved KD, and hips as a kobold commando. Its similar to another I found in Pulse's database, but very unique.  Using the kobold commando form predominantly, its actually pretty amazing.  With the large number of BG levels, I don't miss the epic kobold form and end up with a pretty terrific epic fiend.  With even mundane items, this fellow plays well all the way from 1-40 PvM.  Haven't tried it PvP, but the relatively low hide and MS as a kobold commando may make that difficult.<br><br>I have test built this character in a trainer and am currently playing it on a PW (SoulForge).  Made him a very ugly green gnome, with attitude, so rp potential is great. A very successful fellow and great fun.<br><br>There are some disadvantages, like the low saves (-1 from charisma actually).  I also took the weapon focus later in the build in order to secure other feats earlier.<br><br>Comments/thoughts?<br><br><br><i>Edited title for better clarity - Kail Pendragon</i><br>_________________<br>TeoDeathDealer<br>Member of SoulForge PW (Action)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 10/12/07 20:11</span></i></p>

Kool, thanks for the comment.  Wanted a 13 dex for KD and IKD.  Very important to this build to maximize sneaks.  Agree that Epic Prowess a much better choice over Epic Toughness.  And yes, kobold commando does get +10 to Hide, so with camoflage he is able to get over a 40 hide.  Respectable, but the MS is low.  This would not qualify as a good PvP build.

Right, 13 INT is what I meant.<br><br>Been playing this fellow in a PW and just reached 30th level with him.  An impressive character, as amended with the helpful hints above.  Been great fun RPing this grimmy little fellow, too. All in all, a very cool build to try.
