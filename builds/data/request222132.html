I play on a server called Antiworld Capture the Flag. It is a team based arena where munchkinized builds reign supreme and Clerics are as dirty as ever. I was recently browsing the forumsat the Antiworld website and an expert player posted statistics for a Supreme AA... Dont let me tell you, Here is his post...<br><br>[QUOTE=EvaRampage0100]"am sure just like everything else before this has already been mentioned here. <br><br>I recent made a Monk Bard Arcane Archer. His final Stats are: <br><br>71 AB <br>74 AC <br><br>480 HP <br>Enchant Arrow XIII <br>130% Speed <br>Disc, Hide, Move Silent, Tumble Max. <br>I think 20 ranks in Spell Craft and about 18 in UMD <br><br>( I could gimp him and make it 73 Ab 75 Ac but I usually add a small twist to my builds to make them fun.) <br><br>This character build is broken. I swear to you I only died like 2 times a battle and managed to score 9 MVPs by level 28 <br><br>My worst enemy was a Barbarian with over 300 Hp some nice DR and Terror Rage. <br><br>I dont think any non rogue ranged build can top its performance level."(/quote)<br><br>...<br><br>After seeing this post i quickly looked through my guide and layed out his class perameters which he gave away quite Easily. I came up with him having the Following values for classes:<br><br>Monk 9-11<br>Bard 2-6<br>Arcane Archer 25-26<br><br>Could somebody please help me sort out this build? His AC and AB are quite decent and so far I hven't been able to come close (OK, i got AB to 70, but AC is only like 69). I cannot possibly consieve the Ab and AC working into such cramped requirements.<br><br>I figured he had at least 18 in Dex, at least 14 in Wis and at least 12 in Cha. <br><br>Any posts will help. Another concept I saw was a Paladin Bard AA, and its stats owned these ones. I bet they used divine shield in their build. If anyone has any comments or have made builds that work out to these values please post them.

A believe Antiworld only allows items up to +5.<br><br>Anyhow I don't have time to build you a Monk/Bard/AA for you now, but I have made a Paladin/Bard/AA which you can view here: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "210267", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>.

My guess is Monk 10/Bard 4/AA 26 or 11/3/26 (to grab the extra AA bonus feat).<br><br>As for the build, I'll guess this:<br><br>Pre-epic, he'll take WF for +1 AB (necessary for AA), and have a BAB of +17. In epic, he'll get +10 to BAB and have 11 feats (7 general and 4 AA bonus feats).<br><br>Epic Weapon Focus<br>Armor Skin<br>Epic Prowess<br>8x GRT DEX<br><br>Total BAB at level 40 = +27<br>Assuming 18 start DEX, final DEX = 36 = +13 AB<br><br>+13 AB<br>+13 arrows<br>+1 Epic Prowess<br>+1 Weapon Focus<br>+2 Epic Weapon Focus<br>+27 BAB<br>+6 (assuming varous DEX-boosters to get +12 DEX)<br>+5 weapon<br>+1 PBS (assuming melee range)<br>+1 Bard Song<br><br>Total = +70 AB Not sure where he's getting the other +1.<br><br>Armor Class:<br>10 Base<br>+8 Tumble<br>+2 Armor Skin<br>+13 DEX<br>+6 (assuming DEX boosted to max)<br>+2 inherent Monk AC from levels<br>+20 (assuming +5 from gear to all types, except shield)<br>+4 (assuming Haste)<br>+2 (assuming 14 WIS)<br><br>Total = 68 AC. You could add anywhere from +1 to +6 depending on if he has WIS-boosting gear. If he can boost WIS by the full +12, then that will result in 74 AC.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

The problem with overamping the wisdom bonus is that the only way to boost wisdom on antiworld is to use a helm... My stats for +12 dex rely on a +5 helm, +3 belt and +4 bracers (max bonus w/o magic changed to 12 from 10, where a cat's grace spell would need to be used for last 2 pts). I figure by level 36 ish I could switch my Dex helm for a Helm of Brilliance (+4 Wisdom) and pick up a stronger set of Belt and Barcer (and use cat's grace to buff to +12). <br><br>Also on antiworld u can easily recast buffing over and over to get a roll of 4 (rest time = ~3 seconds). This could bump AC up an approximate 4 points. I hope that helped a little.<br><br>The other AA i mentioned was reposted into the build's competition, and I didn't have time to copy the picture of her in game stats. She was a pally-bard-AA and had over 83 AB <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif"> . Her damage and AC where only slightly better, but i presume she had a HIGH charisma value and its too cramped balancing these stats as is.<br><br>Thx for all of your help, and I hope we manage a conclusion before the end of the month. I am trying to make the character on the halls of advanced training (Haste is free on this server so I am assuming +4 AC).<br><br>I will use my experiments to try to find the maximum value of AC.<br><br>If i find out the exact build I will post it in the Epic Builds section.

I would just like to say thanks alot. It really has been a great help, but my ever-wandering eye has grown in curiosity around the ranger now... Gone are my days of AA working.<br><br>Alas, thus will be the way of my studious endevor of learning to create great characters; Moving only with the flow of the patches, from class to class, ceaselessly until I create my masterpiece. I'm fairly close to perfecting a damage baised ranger as is, but I currently need to iron out a few problems (pesky AC and other etc things). <br><br>Most recently I tried to combine Bane of Enemies with Cleric Buffs and a Monk's attack numbers (dual wielding Kamas, pure dex u could say). Alas, the BAB was too shoddy for AW (only 68 or so not dual wielding, only 64 dualin it up...).<br><br>Once again thank you, and may you fare well to wherever you may fare...
