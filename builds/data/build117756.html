Just a couple of comments.. I know this is not a recent post.<br><br>Take Monk at level 1, lose 1 AB gives one free feat (The monk gets cleave at level one) and you get a few hitpooints more<br><br>Take Monk at level 40, save skill points and max tumble that gives you +8 to AC<br><br>Drop one level of COT, use it for Cleric instead and gain an Epic Cleric bonus feat.

Yup, thats good advice about the early monk level. Take one early and take one at 40 to max skills. You can drop down to 16 CoT levels as 17 really does nothing for your character that 16 doesn't already give. You get absolutley no class features at 17 CoT. You can even keep your AB the same by moving a cleric level post epic to allow the monk level in preepic.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>
