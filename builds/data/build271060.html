This is a build I made to play on a PW. This particular PW requires Epic Weapon Specialization as an additional prerequisite for Devastating Critical. If it was not, I would make it slightly different in order to max out discipline and get DevCrit earlier and maybe pick up Automatic Still spell with the extra feats. It also means that there are a few levels where your Intelligence is below par for the wizard spells you might be able to cast for a few levels in epic. I may post the ideal build without house rules later, but for now this build is not only tested but I got it up to level 40 on said PW and it is bloody insane.<br><br>The idea is simple: a spellcasting, full armor and tower shield wearing, devcritting Scimitar of Speed weilding weaponmaster. At earlier levels, you'll want to take your armor off to buff up and save the still spell slots for any offensive spells or shorter term buffs that will need to be replenished on the fly (like Imp Invis and Acid Sheath).  Eventually you'll be able to still spell ALL of your buffs and still have decent offensive spells. The drawback to this build is your spell DCs will be comparatively low, so it's better to use spells that either deal direct damage (IGMS) or don't offer a real save (Forceful and Grasping Hands are a favorite). Also, you'll have a tough time getting through high Spell Resistances. True Strike is GREAT in a pinch. Greater Magical Weapon, Keen, and Flameblade turn the normally weak Scimitar of Speed into a +5 weapon of critting destruction with enough burn and strength to make it deadly even against undead. WotB is only good against hordes of lower level badies, so stick to Time Stop and stilled Horrid Wiltings and Sunbursts (depending on the enemy). I chose Illusionist as a specialty school since there were very few worthwhile buffs and this build is, at heart, a buff and melee build with a few extra perks and you need the extra spell slots.<br><br>Spellblade - Fighter(8), Weapon Master (7), Wizard(25)<br>Race: Human, Alignment: Any<br>PvM or PvP (You'll have to either go in buffed or use Greater Sanctuary to give you time to get off a few buffs if you're caught unbuffed)<br>Playable Levels: 1-40<br><br>STR: 17 (27)<br>DEX: 13 <br>CON: 12 <br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 15 (20)<br>CHA: 8 <br><br>Hitpoints: 290<br>Skillpoints: 246<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 20/20/18<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells +9, Wizard Buffs<br>BAB: 26<br>AB (Naked, unbuffed/Naked, buffed): 38/45<br>AC (naked/mundane armor and shield/Buffed armor and shield): 17/28/49<br>Spells: Wizard 25<br><br>SKILLS<br>Take 20 ranks in tumble cross classed for the AC boost.<br>Max Spellcraft for the save boost.<br>Max Concentration later on and max discipline whenever you have the chance.<br>The rest are up to you.

As I said, this is meant to be played with a scimitar of speed and the full plate and tower shield available on a server where Epic Weapon Specialization is an additional prerequisite to DevCrit.  It's a buff fighter so there are some spells you should always have ready: Mage Armor (even after you have Epic Mage Armor for the extra +1 Dodge), Greater Magic Weapon, Keen Edge, Flameblade, Mind Blank (Lesser if solo, regular if in party), Shadow Shield, Premonition (Stoneskin and Greater Stoneskin earlier on), Improved Invisibility, Bull Strength, Endurance, Fox Cunning, Owl's Wisdom (for a bonus to Will saves), Protection from Alignment or Magic Circle Against Alignment, Energy Buffer (Protection From Elements or Resist Elements earlier on).  There are a few GREAT short term buffs, as well: True Strike (NEVER underestimate this one... your AB will be over 60 at max level... and you're likely to hit on all five of your attacks... giving a true 50% crit chance you don't need to Still spell it because it does not have a somatic component and can be cast in full armor without penalty), Mestil's Acid Sheath, Elemental Shield, Death Armor (you've got a high AC, so this isn't a game breaker, but if they manage to hit you they'll PAY for it... good against swarms of high AB opponents), Spell Mantle (this is good early on against anything that might try to dispel you. Once you hit 25 Wizard, you don't really have to worry about it so much, but it can be good to defend against offensive spells), and finally Greater Sanctuary (this isn't a short term buff, but will be used as such... essentially, this is your escape button... if you're caught unbuffed or somehow outgunned, use this to get your buffs on so you can fight or run at your leisure... also, it doesn't have a somatic component, so can be cast without Still spell and without armor penalties).  Offensive spells: IGMS (The BOMB against anything you have trouble hitting... which isn't much, so I also tend to use it as a ranged weapon... I RARELY use a bow ((only to draw out individual baddies from nasty spawns)) since in most cases, I can just toss out an IGMS or two to take care of anything I can't reach with my scimitar), Bigby's Forceful Hand (Great against low strength opponents... especially early on since it will beat anything with less than a 38 strength most of the time), Bigby's Grasping Hand (Good against low to medium AC opponents: it uses your caster level and Int mod to determine what AC it can effect, maxing out at 1d20 + (25 ((level)) + 5 ((int)). Essentially you're attacking with a 30 AB in order to immobilize an opponent), Power Word Stun (against anything with less than 150 hp), Control Undead (Useful against mindless undead mainly... don't expect a lich to fail his save), Mordikain's Sword (Always good to have an indestructible ally whacking at your enemies... might even draw their attention off of you!), Horrid Wilting (your save DC sucks, but at 25d8 damage you can deal a good amount of damage to a large number of enemies even if they make their save), Sunburst (Since undead are immune to Horrid Wilting's negative energy damage, and your spell DCs suck so Undeath to Death is ineffective, you can deal out 25d6 (or at least half) against swarms of powerful undead), Greater Dispel (Cripple a buff fighter or caster with less than 25 caster levels), Greater Spell Breach or Mordenkain's Disjunction (Cripple any buff fighter or caster without care for level... still spell Greater Spell Breach... Mordies doesn't require a somatic component, so can be cast in full armor without penalty), Wail of the Banshee (good for disposing of large numbers of low fort save enemies quickly, but don't expect it to take out anything epic), and Timestop (you can use it the usual way: to cast more spells, but it is also useful to give you a few free attacks against an opponent without allowing retribution. This is also a spell that does not require somatic components and so can be cast in full armor without a chance of failure from armor).<br><br>Most of the time, you'll just buff up and charge out and devcrit everything in sight.  But you have several tricks up your sleeve for anything that's more of a challenge.  Discipline can be a problem later on (with this build... the ideal build takes the two post epic fighter levels at 30 and 40 to give max discipline), but ideal equipment includes a Scimitar of Speed and Dragon Slippers. Ideally you will also have the highest INT helmet available, an amulet of greater health, and a few other nice things... <br><br>Some will probably question the wisdom of landing with odd numbered strength a dex... the answer is simple: Stength will be modified by Bull Strength, which caps at +5... leaving it at an even number (plus it's one less you have to factor in when trying to find decent items). Dex is only going to be +1, anyway... you're wearing full plate. You need a 13 Dex to qualify for feats required for Weapon Master.<br><br>*Glances back over the post... clears his throat* Wow... ermm... didn't realize it would be this big... so... any comments from those who manage to read through the whole bloody thing?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Setanta1978 on 04/14/07 08:59</span></i></p>

Personally I would delay Dev Crit further and start with STR 16 giving you more points to dump into CON and DEX. You need hitpoints as a meleer. Maybe even sacrifice KD for Toughness too.<br><br>Also swap Epic Prowess for Armor Skin - Your unbuffed AB could do with it.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 04/14/07 16:39</span></i></p>

I've found that KD is necessary against certain enemies in the game... I'm willing to sacrifice the extra 40 hp (I make it up in Con items and Endurance spells... I'm actually using a Con Ioun Stone) for the ability to keep undead casters on their bums.<br><br>As for Epic Prowess and Armor Skin, I was in a debate about that, myself... I decided that since low hp is this char's weakness, I'd knock the hit percent down by 10% instead of raising his by 5%... but it could be done either way. If you have trouble hitting something, cast True Strike... if you are getting hit too much, you need some sort of AC that you're not already capping with Epic Mage Armor... that would be dodge or true natural. Though they are both good suggestions... maybe I'll test that out... stay tuned for the normal rules version...
