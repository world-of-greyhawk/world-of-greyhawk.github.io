Firstly i'd like to say... Nice ab &amp; ac..<br>But that is almost all :/<br><br>HP is only 370 without con items, and it won't do much damage (unarmed 1-20, bow even lower than that)<br><br>So, whats the purpose of this build?<br>_________________<br>"To say nothing, especially when speaking, is half the art of diplomacy."<br><br>Member of Darkstar ^^

Tranquil Archer indeed!  With only 1-8points of damage with a bow, he's about as close to a pacifist as you can get.  In fact, I question the utility of such feats as PBS and Rapid Shot and the foci in bows.  I suppose it's designed for the run-and-plink method.<br><br>Perhaps dropping WF: Kama for WF: Bows would help a bit, and allow you to take some needed feats like Called Shot.  Since he doesn't have a way to keep an enemy at bay (i.e., spells, summons, UMD, etc.), Called Shot:Leg might go a long way.  Although your AB may never get high enough to make that truly useful.<br><br>Still, an interesting build.  I recall you, or someone else perhaps, posting a Tranquil Archer not too long ago, yes?<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Called shot is in there, look closer.<br><br>Also, this monk is a build specific to the server I play on, where the weapons make her pretty stout (There are even uber bows with special uber arrows).  It's a DEX server where Str does not play into damage much at all.  AC and AB are king there.<br><br>SD is only there for Epic Dodge, since PVP is very very rare on the server I play on.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Eyethumper on 11/18/05 22:53</span></i></p>
