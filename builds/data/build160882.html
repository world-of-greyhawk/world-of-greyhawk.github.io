Magical Marauder, wielding a greatsword, has a 30% chance for a critical hit. Arcane Knight has 55%, and his critical hit deals x3 damage, not x2.<br>Arcane Knight has Epic Mage Armor, and uses a shield - his AC is much greater then this of Magical Marauder. Arcane Knight has 51 AC when fully buffed, and without magic items. Magical Marauder has 43 AC with +5 items.<br><br>Magical Marauder has better saves, slighly more HP (when fully buffed), and access to feats like Improved Knockdown and Blind Fight.

Hi Tengudor_t ,<br><br>   Very nice build and great replies to the questions above!! Thanks again for sharing the build. I like it alot and may try it out as my next build. I've never tried a caster before because of liking the melee too much. This build is a great mixture where I can focus on playing like a wizard, but kick a little *** physically if I want to.<br><br><br>                            Thanks, Mano<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick.

There are some minor differences, but the biggest one is that your character has about 100 HP less when fully buffed.<br><br>I'd stick with Arcane Knight.

I have to say that on the same night that you posted this, i had exactly the same idea!  I have a nice bastard sword on the pw i play so i made mine to use that (so mine has to be more melee based, loosin a few caster feats).  <br><br>I thank you for posting yours though cuz i did learn alot from it!  The way i did mine originally i didnt think about gettin mage armor! I took most of my wiz lvls after 20 (i think i had 3 wiz lvls before 20) so i was short at 39 and had to take auto still.  I had already created my char before i saw yours, and I started with str 17  int 16 dex 13 which left my con 10.  To make up for this i am debating on taking Toughness as a feat.  <br><br>Thanks again.<br><br>Peace

I hope you plan on playing this on a server without Dev Crit but since it's in your build I'm guessing you aren't. A Dev Critter will take this char out quickly with a fort save that low.

A dev critter would take almost any character out very fast - when it comes to close combat. But Arcane Knight has ways of fighting that kind of opponents:<br><br>-with full buffs and Expertize on, he has 57 AC without any magical items. Every attack on him has also 50% chance to miss anyway, if the opponent has no Blind Fight. This means that enemies with Dev. Critical, but not the highest AB, will have trouble hitting him - especially when you cast Bigby's Interposing Hand at them.<br>-Why not take enemies out from the distance? Cast Bigby's Grasping Hand or Bigby's Crushing Hand on them and then spam maximized IGMS on them. Ordinary warrior will die after 2-3 IGMSs.<br>-Cast Time Stop, run to them and attack them in melee. Ig your opponent is not critical immune or does not have giant AC, it is unlikely that he will survive this.<br>-Use Invisilibity, Greater Invisilibity and Greater Sanctuary to attack them when they don't expect.<br><br>PS. I consider servers that ban Devastating Critical absurd - almost as much as this feat.

Epic mage armor is okay, but doesn't give you a straight +20 AC modifier, instead it gives you 4 +5s, the one to dodge is likely the only one that will count, assuming +5 magical equipment.  That's the reason I avoided it.  I agree your build has a higher AC, but when you can cast Mestil's Acid Sheath, Elemental Shield and Death Armor getting hit isn't that bad.  If you're fighting an opponent with devastating critical, you can just cast those spells folowed by shapechange and change into a golem, odds are they'll die before you do.  As you noted in another post, these characters have multiple means of defeating an opponent with devastating critical as opposed to duking it out with them.  The trick is to let your magic immobilize or otherwise disable your opponent, and let your weapon do the killing.  <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Magical Marauder has better saves, slighly more HP (when fully buffed), and access to feats like Improved Knockdown and Blind Fight.

45 AB (not 37, 37 is without buffs - and most of them are cast on your weapon, which is rarely dispelled by dispel spells) is very decent - many fighters have that much of it. Also, you can always cast True Strike - +15 to AB (60), propably all your blows will land, and 55% of them will be critical hits. But if you prefer, you can always play this character with other weapon - I don't like the "critical strike: better chance vs better counter" debate, and I will not fall into it here.

My mistake, I should have written "biggest critical range possible" - and that will be correct.<br>But this character still has a very big chance of scoring a critical - with 60 AB for those more demanding enemies, only other spellswords (from characters with dev. crit) can have more - but their critical range would be possibly lower.

Great build Tengudor_t, I have a similar build but with two main changes:<br>1. Replace expertise, combat casting, and imp combat casting with two weapon fighting, ambidex, and imp 2 weapon.  This will give you 2 more attacks per-round to use that dev crit.<br><br>2. Replace autostill3 with imp knockdown, or imp expertise, with a free feat (allow for an elf build).  My justification for this is you can 'normal still' all spells up to level 8.  Level 9 spells are mostly verbal so you don't loose out much.  Also, with dual wielding build, it's more combat oriented so you should buff before fight.  So you really don't need autostill3/combat casting.<br><br>Those changes may require switching feats around a little, maybe a level or two.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Q.

These improvements would result in lowering your AB by 4 (unless you choose Exotic weapon proficiency for kukris, in which case it's only -2), your AC by at least 3 (ordinary tower shield) and your HP by 80 (because you somehow have to gain this 15 dex), and without Expertise it would not be possible to have WM levels. However, if someone likes double-wielding VERY much, this might be a good variation for him - but I'd stick with one-hander.<br><br>Non-automatic still spell has benefits, but also drawbacks - you have less spells (you never have more spells of level n+1 the of level n), and True Strike (essential for this character) cannot be cast as an ordinary still spell (at least used to in 1.64, no idea if now too). You'd also lose Maxed IGMS and Greater Spell Mantle, which both requires somatic component.

Well, it would require to change one of his feats into Brew Potion - one I don't really like (mostly because of the experience loss when creating potions), although other might consider it more useful then I do.<br><br>In some situations the dual-wielding build without auto still spell would be better, is some - the more classical one. I'd advice to stick to the one you like more.

True Strike on a Potion is pretty much worthless, by the time you drink your potion, the spell effect ends.<br><br>Also depending on server difficulty your inviteing an attack of opertunity, and if you want to do some serious melee your chugging potions pretty much constantly, meaning that your looseing attacks, chaces to cast spells, there getting a ton of free attacks on you.<br><br>All in all, Potions for a Melee/Mage are not a good substitute when you have better alternatives available.
