Hi,<br><br>Another member to the Dwarven Assassins Guild! Welcome!<br><br>Some thoughts:<br>1. Can you drop Wisdom to boost Dex or Str? I think I'd rather have those points for Dex (bonus to AC and AB), or to Str for extra damage (and loot hauling <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> ).<br>2. I'd like to see Epic Prowess fit in - perhaps in place of Superior Initiative.<br>3. How about pushing for Monk 6 (Improved Knockdown) ASAP? I'm not sure why you took the 2 levels of Assassin in there. (SD 1 brings HIPS, so I understand why you took that early).<br><br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br><i>"Where there is life, there is hope." - Grover</i>

His damage will be coming from his fists and sneaks, plus however he chooses to buff himself with UMD, or his use and skill in traps.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;2.

Thanks for the feedback.<br><br>Regarding Str and Wis, I had also considered dropping Int to 12 and changing Str to 14.  You would lose 40 skill points (and 1 Death Attack DC), but you could just drop Intimidate.<br>Wis also helps a 'little' with Stunning Fist DC.<br><br>Epic Prowess could be sneaked in, Superior Initiative was taken as an Assassin's bonus feat.  Take Great Dex instead at 34 and Epic Prowess at 33; that would also free up Improved Initiative if you wanted to change that ... Toughness maybe, and then you could keep your Int at 14 and drop Con to 12, with only a loss to your Fort save.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;3.

I took the 2 Assassin levels early so as to get Uncanny Dodge (Assn 2) as early as possible, you need to keep that Dex AC.  The leveling is pretty flexible in this build, unfortunately you are only getting 1 Epic Bonus Feat, so in the scheme of things it doesn't matter too much what you take when.  Tailor it to suit your PW needs.
