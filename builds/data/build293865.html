Back from a long silence, here I come singing aloud the glory of the darkness. Let the forces of light despair, the howling of the black wind will strike fear in their hearts as it leads the armies of the night to conquer and pillage...<br><br><br><br>Here we have an effective class combo which is fun to play, with undispellable bardic power and almost top lvl bard/curse song, LI early enough, some punch from the fighter and style points from the BG with save boosting and divine feats. Here I went STR 28, CHA 18 just because I like to see a mundane AB of 40+, but going STR 26/CHA 20 is probably better. Traps skills are in for added versatility.<br><br><br><br><b>******************************</b><br><br><br><br><b>Black Wind - Bard(26), Fighter(10), Blackguard(4)</b><br>Human, NE or CE<br><i>PvM, playable 1-40</i><br><br><br><br><b>ABILITIES (ending)</b><br>STR: 16 (28)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 15 (18)<br><br><br><b>BASIC STATS</b><br>Hitpoints: 416<br>Skillpoints: 273<br><br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 28/23/23<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +3<br><br>BAB: 27<br>AB: 40 (melee), 27 (ranged)<br>AB (self buffed): 50-51 (GMW, Bull's STR, War Cry, Bard Song), 57-63 (+ Curse Song and Taunt)<br><br>AC (full plate and shield): 30, <i>(34 Divine Shield)</i><br>AC (self buffed): 46-47 (Cat's Grace, Mage Armor, PfA, Haste, Bard Song), 48-49 (+ Curse Song), <i>(+5/6 Divine Shield, +10 Divine Shield w/ capped CHA)</i><br><br>Spell Casting: Bard(6)<br>Spells known: 5/5/5/5/5/5/4<br>Spells/day: 4/5/5/5/5/4/4<br><br>Bard Song 22nd lvl: +2 AB, +3 dmg, +3 Will, +2 Fort/Ref, +32 HPs, +5 AC, +11 skills<br>Bard Song 26th lvl: +2 AB, +3 dmg, +3 Will, +2 Fort/Ref, +40 HPs, +6 AC, +15 skills<br><br><br><b>SKILLS</b><br>Concentration 43(45), Disable Trap 1(5), Discipline 41(50), Hide 5(4), Perform 43(60), Set Trap 6(5), Spellcraft 13(15), Taunt 43(47), Tumble 40(39), UMD 31(35), no points leftover<br><br><br><b>LEVELING GUIDE</b><br>01: Bard(1): Power Attack, Cleave<br>02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus<br>03: Fighter(2): Knockdown, Blind Fight<br>04: Fighter(3): CHA+1, (CHA=16)<br>05: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization<br>06: Bard(2): Curse Song<br>07: Bard(3)<br>08: Bard(4): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>09: Bard(5): Still Spell<br>10: Blackguard(1)<br>11: Blackguard(2): {Smite Good}<br>12: Blackguard(3): STR+1, Divine Might, (STR=18)<br>13: Bard(6)<br>14: Bard(7)<br>15: Blackguard(4): Divine Shield<br>16: Bard(8): STR+1, (STR=19)<br>17: Bard(9)<br>18: Bard(10): Skill Focus: Perform<br>19: Bard(11)<br>20: Bard(12): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>21: Fighter(5): Epic Weapon Focus<br>22: Fighter(6): Epic Weapon Specialization<br>23: Bard(13)<br>24: Bard(14): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR=22)<br>25: Bard(15)<br>26: Bard(16)<br>27: Bard(17): Epic Skill Focus: Perform<br>28: Bard(18): STR+1, (STR=23)<br>29: Bard(19)<br>30: Bard(20): Lasting Inspiration<br>31: Bard(21)<br>32: Bard(22): STR+1, (STR=24)<br>33: Bard(23): Great Strength II, Great Charisma I, (STR=25), (CHA=17)<br>34: Bard(24)<br>35: Bard(25)<br>36: Fighter(7): STR+1, Great Strength III, (STR=27)<br>37: Fighter(8): Armor Skin<br>38: Fighter(9)<br>39: Fighter(10): Toughness, Epic Prowess<br>40: Bard(26): STR+1, Great Charisma II, (STR=28), (CHA=18)<br><br><br><br><b>******************************</b><br><br><br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><b>•</b>Decent unbuffed Ab, Good buffed AB<br><b>•</b>Good Buffed AC, put in gear for more.<br><b>•</b>22nd lvl Bard Song, 25th lvl Curse Song without gear/buffs<br><b>•</b>Lasting Inspiration at 30th character lvl<br><b>•</b>UMD<br><b>•</b>Taunt<br><b>•</b>Good HPs for a Bard<br><b>•</b>6th lvl Bard spells<br><b>•</b>4 base APR <br><b>•</b>WS/EWS<br><b>•</b>Divine Might/Shield<br><b>•</b>Undispellable<br><br><br><i>Weaknesses</i><br><b>•</b>Tight on skillpoints (well, for my tastes)<br><b>•</b>Low duration/power on divine feats<br><b>•</b>Moderate saves<br><b>•</b>Needs perform/CHA gear<br><br><br><br><b>******************************</b><br><br><br><br>The only build in the search engine with these classes:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "245431", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Explicate Lyrics (Bard 35 / FTR 1 / BG 4)</a><br>-- dmuzzy <br><br><br>Feedback and constructive criticism is, as usual, greatly appreciated.<br>_________________<br>Unto to the darkness<br>I commend my soul<br>Never shall I repent<br>Never shall I be saved<br><br>I'll go into the House of Death<br>Before my last breath<br>My enemies all shall die!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 03/19/08 02:33</span></i></p>

Very strong and unique build.  I was surprised to not see something like this before.  I don't see anything I would change, as it is strong from ground up (though as you suggested, I would be tempted to go for a 20 Charisma).<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 03/17/08 02:38 (GMT) -- Kail Pendragon<br><br>The only build in the search engine with these classes:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "245431", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Explicate Lyrics (Bard 35 / FTR 1 / BG 4)</a><br>-- dmuzzy </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Well, there were these two pesky fellows bouncing around in the ether....<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "199917", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Bastard (Bard 21 / FTR 6 / BG 13)</a><br>-- grizzled_dwarflord<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "209844", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Shrike (Bard 16 / BG 22 / FTR 2)</a><br>-- grizzled_dwarflord<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Superb as usual Kail, just one thing, playing out Bards I've found it's actually easier to play taking heavy Bard at the beginning, to take advantage that Bard gets an XP adjustment at low levels (I don't remember the name for that stuff, ask Cinnabar Din, I believe he knows), I'd recommend you lay back the Fighter levels a bit, taking Fighter in level 2 throws it all out.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 03/17/08 02:58 (GMT) -- avado<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 03/17/08 02:38 (GMT) -- Kail Pendragon<br><i>Weaknesses</i><br><b>•</b>Tight on skillpoints (well, for my tastes)<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>OMG!

To be fair on the RP question, 8 Wis is a fairly common score for bards. Bards and rogues tend to be impetuous type characters to RP anyway, so the 8 Wis fits.<br><br>8 dex for a bard makes me cringe. But oh well. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>I'd go for 20 charisma as well, but I like this build a lot. And honestly I think a dex version of this would still be a lot of fun to play... be interesting to see what it would look like.
