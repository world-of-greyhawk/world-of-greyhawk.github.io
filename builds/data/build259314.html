Here is a Bard that is meant to be able to go through mods taking advantage of melee, arcane and (some) rogue skills.  Not a power build to be sure, but plenty of dungeon-crawling fun.<br><br>Below this write-up, I will post a second version (dual-wielding) that I also toyed around with.<br><br>The Explorer - (Bard 26 / Rogue 10 / RDD 4)<br><br>Human<br>Playable 1-40, PvM<br>(designed for Single-player Mods)<br>Any non-Lawful Alignment<br><br>STR 16 (32)<br>DEX 12<br>CON 14<br>INT 12<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 14 (16)<br><br>1 Rogue 1 - Toughness, Skill Focus: Disarm Trap<br>2 Bard 1<br>3 Bard 2 - Armor Prof: Heavy<br>4 Bard 3 - STR 17<br>5 Bard 4<br>6 Rogue 2 - Weapon Focus<br>7 Bard 5<br>8 Bard 6 - STR 18<br>9 Bard 7 - Knockdown<br>10 Bard 8<br>11 Bard 9<br>12 Rogue 3 - Curse Song, CHA 15<br>13 Bard 10<br>14 Bard 11<br>15 Bard 12 - Blind Fight<br>16 Bard 13 - CHA 16<br>17 Rogue 4<br>18 Bard 14 - Still Spell<br>19 Bard 15<br>20 Bard 16 - STR 19<br><br>21 Rogue 5 - Epic Weapon Focus<br>22 RDD 1<br>23 RDD 2 - [STR 21]<br>24 RDD 3 - Armor Skin, STR 22<br>25 RDD 4 - [STR 24]<br>26 Rogue 6<br>27 Bard 17 - Epic Prowess<br>28 Bard 18 - STR 25<br>29 Bard 19<br>30 Bard 20 - Great Strength III<br>31 Rogue 7<br>32 Bard 21 - STR 27<br>33 Bard 22 - Great Strength IV<br>34 Bard 23 - Lasting Inspiration*<br>35 Bard 24<br>36 Rogue 8 - Great Strength V, STR 30<br>37 Bard 25<br>38 Rogue 9<br>39 Rogue 10 - Great Strength VI, Crippling Strike*<br>40 Bard 26 - Epic Skill Focus: Perform*, STR 32<br><br>AB 40 - [BAB 25 + STR 11 + WF 1 + EWF 2 + EP 1]<br>AC 30 - [Base 10 + Plate 8 + Dex 1 + Tumble 8 + RDD 1 + Armor Skin 2]<br><br>buffed<br>AB 56 - [40 + Bulls 2 + GMW 5 + Warcry 2 + Song 2 + Curse 5]<br>AC 45 - [30 + Mage Armor 4 + Haste 4 + Song 5 + Curse 2]<br><br>HP: 360<br><br>Saves (+8 verses spells)<br>Fortitude: 17 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br>Reflex: 25<br>Will: 20<br><br>Skills: 284<br>Perform 43, Spellcraft 43, Tumble 40, UMD 40, Open Lock 42, Disarm Trap 42, Lore 8 (for RDD), Search 26<br><br>__________________________<br><br>This build was put together as a Bard-of-all-trades.  I've always pictured the Bard as someone that was never quite trustworthy (in a law-abiding sense) and it seemed to me that they should have some nice thievery skills at their disposal.<br><br>This is definitely falls into the RP / Single-player mod category as it could be more combat focused. However, my goal was to have a bard that could also act as the party thief (in a limited sense). Opening locks and disarming traps as well as having some combat and arcane power available.  Ideally you would use this in a mod that would make use of disarming traps and opening locks (perhaps by giving XP for it).<br><br>As such, the Rogue levels were taken for skill dumps in Open Lock and Disarm Trap.  If necessary, you could skimp on something and put points into Set Trap as well.  Due to the skill point starvation, I completely disregarded any attempts to have stealth.  You can either fall back on Potions/Rings or your 2nd level Bard spell if you need invisibility. <br><br>The RDD levels are only there to bolster the AB and get it up to 40.  You could take more, and it would make a stronger build. But I just didn't want to be an "RDD Build" and after testing I didn't think it really was necessary.<br><br>I tested it in the Novice to Epic mod and it performed as expected.  The roughest part is in the beginning levels. After about 8 on, it gets considerably better. The Ultravision/Darkness combo also helps add to your combat effectiveness.<br><br>I purposely left the Weapon Focus empty as you could either go one-handed and a Tower Shield or pick a two-handed weapon for extra damage.  Either way would work, so it would depend on personal preference.  I noticed that many mods (at least the ones I've played) seem to use Rapiers as the "Bard" weapon. So you might take that into consideration.<br><br>I REALLY wanted more skill points, but the only way to do that is to gimp your Con or your Dex.  Either one would work.  And with Cat's Grace, you could make up the Dex later in the build.<br><br>_________________<br><br>Pros<br>- Bard Spells<br>- Bard Song<br>- Curse Song<br>- Decent AC<br>- Decent AB<br>- Un-dispellable buffs (other than Mords)<br>- Disarm Traps<br>- Open Locks<br><br>Cons<br>- Rough early on<br>- VERY Skill starved  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br>- no Taunt<br>- Performs best in party (though not necessary)<br>- probably won't see full utilization of Song<br>- weak saves<br><br>_______________<br><br>Similar Builds<br>These use similar classes, but are all RDD 10 and/or have much less Bard.<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "242362", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> The Fairy Dragon /Bard17/Rogue13/RDD10</a> by Bruce Lee 72<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "245278", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> The Scoundrel /Bard 17/Rogue 13/RDD 10</a> by mphacon<br><br>The closest is mphacon's well done "Scoundrel" (and indeed, I did hesitate to post after reading his build write-up). But my intent not so much a Bard-Rogue mix as it was a Bard with a minor amount of Rogue levels.  Plus the obvious smaller amount of RDD.  Also, mine nets two Bard Epic Feats which I used for Lasting Inspiration and Epic Skill Focus: Perform.  And mine is also un-Dispellable (other than Mord's).

<b>Dual-Wield version</b><br><br>All right,  here is a second version that, while weaker, I actually prefered to play.

You would get better saving throws by taking 4 RDD levels pre-epic (without losing much).<br><br>Bard(16) has saving throws (F/R/W): 5/10/10 while Bard(12)/RDD(4) has 8/9/12. So you gain +3 fortitude and +2 will and -1 reflex. That's the magic of multiclassing.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.Detail&amp;id=856" target="_blank">Character Build Calculator</a>(works with Excel, Open Office) 2.83: updated to NWN 1.69.

I originally had that level split when designing the build, and as you say, it didn't really lose much.  But during my mod testing, I (Debug) tested both versions and found that during certain (pre-epic) battles, the the better Bard song (and spells) made the boss fights much more winnable. So for the sake of leveling I saved the RDD till later.<br><br>But you are correct, in the long run, you'll eventually get your bard songs, but the saving throws would be lost. <br><br>A good suggestion. Thank you.
