My 2 cents: 11 rogue/9 ranger. <br><br>Dex based, use short sword and shield, or dual wield. <br><br>Max hide and move silently, tumble and use magic device, Discipline at ranger levels. <br><br>Feats should be weapon finesse, weapon focus, knockdown, improved critical. The rest is your choice, i.e. stealthy, dodge, mobility...<br><br>At rogue 10 take crippling strike, or improved evasion is you feel more defensive than offensive.<br><br>Stats should be something line this:<br>(assuming human)<br>str 12<br>dex 18<br>con 12<br>int 10<br>wis 12<br>cha 8<br><br>Or if it's too extreme for your tastes, go like this:<br>str 14<br>dex 16<br>con 14<br>int 12<br>wis 12<br>cha 8

Arfra, you didn't read the rules. By the way the rules were laid out, a Ranger 9/Rogue 11 would be invalid.<br><br>I suggest either a pure Rogue or a FTR 10/Rogue 10.<br><br>For Human, I suggest the following starting stats:<br><br>STR 14<br>DEX 15<br>CON 14<br>WIS 10<br>INT 14<br>CHA 10<br><br>All points to DEX. You'll get a 6 FTR bonus feats, so use them for your combat feats:<br><br>Blind Fight<br>Knockdown<br>Imp Knockdown<br>Weapon Focus<br>Weapon Finesse<br>Weapon Specialization<br><br>You get a bonus feat from Human and 7 general feats. I suggest:<br><br>Improved Critical<br>Ambidexterity<br>Two Weapon Fighting<br>Improved TWF<br>Luck of Heroes<br>Iron Will<br>Called Shot<br>Dodge<br><br>For your Rogue bonus feat, it's your choice, but look at Improved Evasion, Slippery Mind, or Crippling Strike.<br><br>This is generic advice, as you didn't indicate if it's for party play, soloing, a mix of each, if you want a Stealther/Skill specialist, a melee Rogue, or what. Depending n what you want, I might suggest different feats or classes.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Although one would think that they would not allow a level 11 to multiclass at all since clearly it wouldn't be possible for them to end up with equal levels.  Is that what they would do Kain?<br><br>Steve

You might think about pwr attack and cleave if you have str of 13 or more. Pwr attack helps with slow undead and cleave gets you in and out of melee faster. <br><br>But rogue there are many, many ways to play a rogue. So most importantly have fun and build a rogue that you can play well.<br>_________________<br>Entropy is a joule thief
