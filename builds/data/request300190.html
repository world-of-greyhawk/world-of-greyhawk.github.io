Wassup.<br><br>So, I was thinking. It's possible to get your stunning fist DC in the 60s, I'm pretty sure, but if you were to take all Imp stunning fist feats to get a Stunning fist DC in the 60s, would you have enough AB to actually hit anyone with it? Even if you caught them flat footed?<br><br>I was looking at the Shadow Boxer <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "221720", "0", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>And I do say, it tickled my fancy.<br>Any way of improving such a build? Perhaps with monk levels instead of fighter? I suppose AC doesn't really matter much if all you're going to do is sneak up on people and stunning fist them, then take them out with sneak attacks...But would it actually work in a +5 environment? <br><br>Talk ta meh!

Check out my <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "238749", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Stunning Claw</a>. No need for sneak, good AB, damage and AC for full frontal stunning mayhem, I hope you like it.

In his post for the build, grizzled_dwarflord explained why it works better without monk.<br>_________________<br>Great Research Tools:<br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWNWiki</a><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">NWN Epic Character Build Search Engine</a><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/" target="_blank">The NWN Vault</a>
