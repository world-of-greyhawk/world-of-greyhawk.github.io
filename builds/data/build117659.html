First off, let me just say that I play on a PW Power Play world, non-PvP. This character was designed for killing monsters, not other players. Even though he will be able to do very well in this category too, but not necessarily be able to survive to the end.<br><br>The idea is a buffing fighter. This is from the top of my head, as the stats is at home, and I'm at work.<br><br>I will give stats as I remember them, so they might be incomplete. Also, I only know the stats as my character is at the moment, all with +5 weapons. I will put base stats in brackets if I remember them, or can work them out. Also, I do not know enough to mix lvl's at certain times, so there might be quite a bit of optimisation possible.<br><br>I always build my characters for the best possible AB, with high'ish hit points and high AC. Ac is mainly gained with items.<br><br>Levels:<br>Fighter 20/Cleric 20<br><br>First 20 lvl's, Fighter<br>Next 20 lvl's, Cleric<br><br>Stats:<br>Start with WIS 16.<br>Keep DEX 15<br>CON at 10.<br>Make INT 13 (for IKD, since it is very important on our server)<br>CHA 8<br>STR the rest.<br><br>Ability point progression:<br>Add everything to STR, but keep the last three for WIS, since you want to be able to cast lvl 9 cleric spells.<br><br>Feats:<br>I take exotic feat, speccing in katana's. Longswords will do fine as well, saving a feat.<br><br>I take these at least and fill in the rest with less important feats.<br>Exotic feat,<br>weap focus( katana)<br>Knockdown<br>Imp Knockdown<br>Weap Spec<br>Imp Crit (Katana)<br>Ambidexterity<br>Two-Weapon Fighting<br>Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>Extend spell<br>Still spell(if you play on a server with lots of undead, or creatures that can be harmed - gives you two lvl's of heal/harm and mass heal)<br>Epic Prowess<br>Epic Weap Focus (katana)<br>Epic Weapon Spec<br>Then great STR, Armour skin and Epic Toughness as necessary<br><br>Skills:<br>Concentration, descipline, spellcraft/lore/heal<br><br>At level 40, you will be a buffing, casting, killing machine. You will be able to cast lvl 9 cleric spells. I feel Dev Crit is a waste of my game, and makes things too easy. Therefore I don't take it. you are free to do so, should you wish, as this character is perfectly capable of doing so. Just take the necessary pre-requisite feats.<br><br>We have lvl 40 Half Dragon monsters on our server, with stats more or less close to these.<br>AC : 71<br>AB : +70/...<br>Saves : 50+<br>Hit Points : 1500<br>Dmg output : 70+ dmg per shot, 5 times a round<br><br>I have 25 dmg reduction/resistance in total, and get 50+ dmg hits on me. I can take out two of them with one heal.<br><br>How, may you ask?<br>Well, I have an AC of 53 (with shield +5, boots+5, armour +5, cloak +5 - that makes an AC of round about 33 with normal 8AC armour)<br>I have an AB of 68 (I use a +7AB, not enchantment, katana - so 61 with normal katana) (buff with bless, aid, prayer, divine power, divine favour) 71 (64 with normal katana) with a "fairly" low lvl bard in the party.<br><br>Switching to two katana's, I have 63 AB (56 with normal katana), doing 1-10 + 9, 8 times a round. +5 magical dmg from divine favour. +1 from prayer. +10 from darkfire.<br><br>Then cast greater magic weapon for +5 to AB and dmg.<br><br>All and all, a very good and fun to play build. My next build will be a 79 AB Palladin/Fighter/CoT, or Palladin/Fighter/Cleric. Still to decide.<br><br>Just a note to torias. MAN!!! I thought I was an uber PP'er, but it seems I met my match. You should come play on our server<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 16:47</span></i></p>
