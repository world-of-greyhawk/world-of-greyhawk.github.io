I play on a server where damage done is always close to max.. so a 1d6 weapon does on average 5-6 points of damage constantly, a 1d12 11-12 etc.<br><br>I read that 9 monk and 5 SD are enough to get you the req for Epic Dodge...<br><br>Is it possible to make an Epic dodge Character, while still doing lots of damage as an unarmed monk, yet still have a decent AB and AC?

You need at least 16 monk levels total to get 1d20 damage, 5 SD, and then the rest can be fighter if you like.  I'd take monk to 18 at least to get empty body.  So, you could so monk(18)/SD(5)/Fighter(17), or something like that.  You'd have to be dex based, so pump that dex and get weapon finesse.  If you want to completely maximize your AB, you could go monk(4)/fighter(16) pre-epic, but you might be better off saving more of those fighter levels for epic to get more epic feats.  So, maybe something like monk(8)/fighter(12) pre-epic, for 18 BAB, and then you'll have a couple more fighter bonus feats in epic.  Something like that at least.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 08/16/05 21:52</span></i></p>

Very interesting, I started playing around with some combos as you suggested.. tried a 20/15/5 M/F/SD<br><br>Took 20 M for Perfect self<br><br>I had one issue though, when I tried 8M/12 Fighter.. I got stuck with lots of useless feats.. Should I get at least 13 Int to pick up Expertise/Improved Exp, and Disarm and Improved Disarm?
