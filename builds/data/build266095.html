Dragon Rider (the “Magical Blade”)<br>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar<br><br><br>Dragon Blade (the “Mighty Rider”)<br>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar<br><br>Concept: <br>Dragon Blades were an elite fighting force, comprised of combat warriors who actually rode and fought upon dragons; the pair, rider and dragon, were dedicated to the preservation and defense of a far away land, somewhere in the desert. It is said the bond between dragon and his/her rider is a strong and magical one. It is also said that, in time, the bond grows between a rider and his/her dragon, such that they begin to “see” and “think” as one, and that each of the pair eventually take on many characteristics of the other. It is widely believed all Dragon Blades (and their dragons) died out during the time of the dragon wars. <br><br>They are wrong: a few survived. <br><br>Character:<br>This character is a “magical” variant, if you will, of my original Dragon Blade, and this variant asks: Want more magic in your step and bard song/curse song power in your rider? Then this, the second of three characters in my latest Dragon Blade series, may be your ticket! Inspired by Grim (whose helpful comments and review are graciously acknowledged), this dragon rider comes complete with level 5 spell access, very good (and highly buffable) AB, and a terrifying rage DC 58-67+<br><br>Others in the Rider Series:<br>If you want more might/raging power instead of magic, then you be seeking the Mighty Rider,    <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "266094", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>    , To see the original Dragon Blade, a cool H/S’er who kicks off this latest series, with links therein also to the 11 other cool builds, being “others of the species” using this class combo, albeit different in terms of the level split (and foci), <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "264359", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> <br><br>And now, without further adieu, please meet: <br><br><br>DRAGON RIDER (the “Magical Blade”) –<br>Barbarian(16), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Bard(14)<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Any Non-Lawful (Theme: Chaotic Good, Chaotic Neutral, or Chaotic Evil)<br><br>I.

Still glad you're hacking away, TyrTemplar.  The build itself is good, and reminds me of Xylophone's Metal Siren, only without the EDR, but works as is.  Is there some kind of &lt;gasp&gt; Eragon theme cooking here?<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

<!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;dealing 1-10 damage (as compared to a big knife’s 2-12)</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I'd say you should forget the little Katana/Bastard sword and be a mean killing machine with a big sword (or rather, axe if you prefer), you could change Exotic Proficiency for Blind-Fight, a must have on melee builds. Remember big knife also gives 1.5 STR damage bonus, I consider pretty much any build with a base STR score above 30 should use a two handed weapon to take advantage of it, and now your effective in-battle STR will be above 40! really consider the two handed weapon.<br><br>Aye, it's a nice build.

Thanks, Dwarflord, Thax; appreciate your kind words, &amp; good to see you, too!. Yeah, Xylo's (all of 'em really) is really cool, each being unique, w. this one delaying drake for BAB(AB), &amp; nothing (I assure you) to do w. the film; me, been tamin' &amp; ridin' dragons since, well, er, let's just say awhile...but this ones' more about bard in the mix, as compared to my orig. rider, having thus a much, much better song &amp; buffs, in exchange for only -1 BAB (&amp; what the heck, haven't done a series in a while so...(and we've Grim to thank for that, folks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">          <br><br>Don't know if you guys have checeked out what they did to bard in nwn2, but *sigh* ... so nice for me to see all those great buffs and song again (and great to see you guys posting, too). And Thax, indeed! A mean killing machine, eh? (love your style-does this mean Claw reconsidered?!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">           <br><br>Yeah, could easily switch out for big knife or great axe or, since BF's not *really* neces. here (has detection- ie., listen 66+ (amplify, song, curse), plus see invis., grt'r dispel, etc.); so, if you *really* wanted to be mean, could pick up scythe (w. str., bard keen &amp; buffs to make it worthwhile). Options, options, and your ideas be awesome (thanks!). Of course, if goin' PvE, different story: BF more important, in which case big knife ... or big axe ... or ... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">           <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">           <br><br>Thanks, guys, and Ride On! ~ Tyr<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 02/16/07 16:39</span></i></p>
