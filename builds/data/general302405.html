When I was looking over the wiki I saw one comment about tenser's transformation being able to use the cleave feat inherent in the shape to qualify for blackguard.  This got me thinking, perhaps a little too much, and taking the example to its logical end I recently leveled up a 13 wizard/13 Arcane Archer/14 Dwarven Defender, using the fact that tenser's could change my race to elf.  Though the shape does not affect your qualification for feats, the feats and race inherent in polymorph and shifter shapes can qualify you for a prestige class in the selection.  If this exploit was just limited to natural shifted forms it would not be a major bug, but the fact that tenser's comes in scroll form opens up a free cleave and elf qualification to any arcane caster (You can make a bard 9/AA 13/DwD 18 by using the scroll).  Other race changes to meet prestige class prerequisites can only be found in shifter, and the elf ones here don't help as arcane archer requires arcane spellcasting, but azer chieftan will qualify you race-wise for dwarven defender (which doesn't do much except for attaching the benefits of a different natural race to leveling like the human skill point bonus(though you don't get this on levels taken in a shifted form) and extra feat).  As 1.69 is out now and it is unlikely for further bug fixes I feel that this should be a topic of consideration, as a determination in this regard would set a standard for the guild.

So you can't get spring attack because an item gives you dodge and mobility, but you can get shadowdancer (provided you meet the skill rank criteria).<br>Basically the class selection takes your character in its current form into selection, and the feat selection looks at a natural view of your character development.<br><br><br><br>It is a matter of decision as if bard/AA/DwD is allowed (which needs an external scroll to level) then it could equally be argued that many classes don't have to have all the prerequisite feats in the build due to the external ability to get these feats from items.  Both tenser and items with alertness, dodge, and perhaps other such feats as well appear in the OC.<br><br>If we are to rule on the one hand that a build can use external means (regular toolkit equipment) to level uniquely, then there will be many builds that skip over feats like whirlwind attack and alertness.  If we are to rule that unique leveling is okay provided the character has the natural ability (e.g. casting of tenser) to level this way, then we do not allow all possible builds, but allow for builds that qualify for a different race than the natural race.  If we do not allow race and feat hooking then while not being any more restrictive than before, we are acknowledging that many better builds can be built than we would allow.

I've played with Druids for a long time and I save shifted a lot.

I hate that, my Haste from my armor always goes to hell when I load a shifted save.<br>There is one particular observation I always found wierd: Stoneskin has a different visual effect when casted on a player than on an animal (or monster, this observation is made on my animal companion), the player will get its skin hardened iron-like while the animal companion gets a swirling piece of rock around its body, which means Stoneskin on a non-PC I guess, I really don't know why this happens. So, if you had Stoneskin as a buff and you save shifted, when you load you will see the swirling rock visual effect like if you were an animal instead of the player-like visual effect or iron skin.<br><br>The game itself won't do anything even if it were to figure out your build is illegal. I'd say that using Tenser's with a Sorcerer or Wizard that knows the spell to become Arcane Archer without being elf is technically legal since you're just exploiting a game error.<br><br>For the purposes of posting builds, as far as the character doesn't need any intervention from items like acquiring the scroll, it won't go against any rule. Personally, I would hate to see builds that meet class requirements through items, but I have no objection against meeting them through an exploit inherent to the build itself.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

When your character is saved in a shifted form, enforce legal character will ignore all feats you have unnaturally (as if you were unshifted).  If you have feats from items these are taken into consideration even if the item properties didn't merge into the shift.  If you saved in shifted form though as of the 1.69 PC skin (for horse features) You will enter the game unshifted with your shifted creature skin in your main inventory (bug?).

Ok, Shifter seems to be out for trying to qualify for AA - because Weapon Proficiency : Martial Weapons is not selectable as a Druid or a Shifter, and thus, one cannot actually qualify for AA (Weapon Focus : Longbow).<br><br>Though one DOES get Martial Weapons Proficiency with Epic Drow Warrior, one cannot "use" it to take Weapon Focus : longbow.  Drats!<br><br>Thus, one either has to be an Elf as Race to start with (as they get Long and Shortbow proficiency, so they can get Weapon Focus : Longbow, which is a requirement for AA) or one has to take a Class that does offer the feat, and therefore all 3 class slots are full, meaning one cannot take AA levels.<br><br>Bummer <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br>What does work well, is Tensor's Transformation - I was able to make a Dwarven Wizard/AA/DD easily enough using the spell (both from casting, and from a scroll).  Unfortunately, it does not seem possible to increase the BAB so that one can qualify for the 6 AB earlier (tried using a variety of spells and items to do it - nope).<br><br>Bard/AA/DD is also possible, but requires an Alignment change.<br><br>Unfortunately, Defensive Stance does not allow the use of a missle weapon (shucky darn!) - still, it is a pretty interesting mix of offensive and defensive capabilities.  Though the Bard build has more attacks (and they are certainly at a higher AB) than the Wizard version (didn't try a Sorc version, may want to try that - Sorc/AA/DD, but with the minus to Cha from Dwarf...bleh), the Wizard version, with full 9th level spellcasting, can cast some pretty good buffing.<br>_________________<br>A Tangled Web - Upcoming PW with PRC+CEP<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By WebShaman on 11/01/08 20:08</span></i></p>

If you're looking for shifted hooks only (no items), shifters can only hook a prestige class in epic levels.
