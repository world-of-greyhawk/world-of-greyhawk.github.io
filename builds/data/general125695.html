The two bladed sword and double axe, these two weapons seem very underused to me, I have a question about them.  Are they treated like a normal weapon? like a greatsword? or is it like dual wielding 2 longswords? where you would need Ambidexterity and 2 wep fighting, etc...?<br><br>I am trying to make an epic char build that uses this (it would be my first good one haha) so I am just curious...<br><br>any help on this would be greatly appretiated<br>_________________<br>When the Trickster starts a-walking,<br>He sets the whole world askew...<br>Just when you thing that it's all through,<br>It's just the birth of something new.

Wielding a double weapon counts as dual wielding. With TWF and ambidexterity you get the usual -2 AB penalty on each hand as if you were wielding two weapons of size below your character's size.<br><br>Disadvantages? You need exotic weapon proficiency<br>Advantages? You get a 1d8 weapon on your off hand <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Note: No double weapon is finesseable.

Yeah - basically, the penalty is having to take an extra feat to open up Exotic Weapons. <br><br>But the benefit is that all of your bonuses apply to both attacks of the weapon. So for example, if your Wizard buddy buffs your two bladed axe, you get the benefit of the magic buff and the flame buff and Keen, to the same weapon. The same applies to bonuses found on the weapon.<br><br>Also, note that to get a 1-8 (19-20/x2) in both hands, you would need two longswords--in which case you wind up with a -4 penalty to your attacks as opposed to the standard -2 for having the offhand weapon being 1-size smaller.

A lot of players opt for two weapons instead of the double weapon for extra boosts.

A special note (yet another ambiguous / incorrect rule) even though double weapons are 2 handed weapons, you only get 1x strength damage and not 1.5x<br><br>I hate the documentation for this game, so much.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By deleaton on 07/23/04 03:23</span></i></p>
