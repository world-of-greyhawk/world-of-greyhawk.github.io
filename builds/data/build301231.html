This build is created in parallel to the Risen Lord shape in an attempt to depict what he might have been in life.  A scythe with whirlwind and cleave make this an unusual build, nevertheless, one I am happy to reproduce.  First of consideration is the source of power of this unknown lord.  My design portrays a highly charismatic ruler (as might be typical of one taking the title lord) that uses charisma in his own way as a powerful weapon.  I envisioned a paladin who had exchanged his divine powers for the immortal life, similar to how Dorian gave away his soul to remain eternally young.<br>From a power gaming prospective, this build is there to nearly maximize the total amount of divine damage the character can deal per day thus making it a formidable champion against creatures with heavy protection and immunities to melee attacks in general.  Much of the level progression and some feats are there to increase the AB by natural means making it all the more powerful in a higher magic setting where scabbards of blessing and other magic items are common.<br><br>Lord Who Will Arise (Fighter 9/Paladin 3/Weapon Master 10)<br>Human, Lawful Good<br>PvM/PvP 1-40, High Magic Environment is optimal<br><br>Abilities: original (ending)<br>Str 14<br>Dex 14<br>Con 10<br>Wis 8<br>Int 14<br>Cha 16 (32)<br><br>Skills:  ranks (naturally modified)<br>Discipline 43 (45)<br>Heal 43 (42)<br>Lore 43 (45)<br>Intimidate 42 (53)<br>Tumble 20 (22)<br><br><br>Leveling<br>1.

Before I say anything, You'll probably want to take a look at <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "294782", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>this</a>.  It doesn't come up in the Search Engine because the Mods in this Guild are all under a deep enchantment spell, but it is more or less the same thing (although I'm not sure where you are coming from with the Risen Lord thing).  My suggestion would be to take Divine Shield, especially with a 2-handed weapon, and to work the Taunt skill in there with that built-in Epic skill focus.  Weapons aside, I personally would rather go with something that had DS and Taunt to raise the AB than for something with just Cleave and no DS/Taunt.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Every +1 to charisma modifier increases the total divine damage a little more effectively than the transition from x^3 to (x + 1)^3  and this small increases effectively outweighs the 18x extra damage that divine wrath could give.<br><br>As for the build you showed I didn't find it on pulse caps, and was certain that my post would be original.  In any regard this build does exceed the other build in total divine damage (that ignores all resistance and immunities) per rest as was the field concentration.

interesting idea, but you are forgetting one important thing: my Risen lord shape ALWAYS had dev crit!!  I dont see that in your build??<br><br>btw, choice of weapon doesnt really make the build technically different.  And, while the idea that scythe can have higher damage (math is just a tool to keep the ignorant in check!) having a shield makes you harder to hurt (ac wise).  I would like to see grizs and yours go at it with +5 gear, and you would all of a sudden suffer a -8 to your ab, which can be very substantial.  <br><br>Either way, it is nice to see that you are thinking outside the box (while remaining firmly within the realms of others' ideas that dont show up on the search engine...

I must side with Grizzly Midgetlord here. All that Charisma and no Divine Shield or Taunt. While you do have Heal and Lore skill. When I micx Pal and WM though, I usually go with 16 PAL and 22 WM to get the Paladin buffs. Might be tight on feats though. Consider a Fighter6/WM19/Pal15 perhaps, with WIS 14 instead of INT. Heal and lore can be spared. Gives you three less AB, but access to GMW, Bless, Aid, Prayer, Holysword and som CHA boosting spells. Not to be overlooked IMO. Again though, you'll miss out on feats.....<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

I like the RP idea of playing the risen lord before undeath.<br>I see your build as a power build made within some limitations set by the idea of the character role.<br>I also believe you when you say the other build didn't show up on the search engine - it happens all the time. So I will give you credit for the build. The idea of WM giving AB in a charisma build is a sound idea. And I see that at least two minds think alike here, producing that kind of builds.<br><br>From a power perspective I agree with dwarflord on taking divine shield in a two-hander build, and I also think taunt is a far better skill here than intimidate.<br><br>Finally I will say once more that I see the limitations you work under in this build, and the roleplayer im me like what you try to do.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...
