I was looking through the builds awhile back and I thought I read on someone's blackgaurd build that one of the pro's was that it was sneak attack immune. Either they had a typo and meant to say that they got sneak attacks or I misread it because I'm pretty sure(99.9%) that the only way to achieve immunity to sneak attacks is through items or shapechange/shifting. If I am mistaken in any of this please correct me.

Correct, only way to become sneak immune is to shapeshift.<br>Though a dwarven defender with superior initiative is very sneak attack resistant due to them being unable to be flanked.  About the only way to sneak them is to knock em down.

There are some PRC additions that have PrCs like elemental savant that become immune to sneak attacks as well.

Wouldn't a 20 wiz/10 elem savant/10 lich be practically invulnerable to anything?  Immune to sneak, immune to crits, 30/+20 dmg reduction, elemental resists, immune to lvl 9 spells + all the wiz dmg reduction feats.  I mean that's just crazy, crazy overwhelming just lay down now cause I'm gonna stomp ya no matter what crazy?

Well lich makes you very powerful. From my understanding most PRC using worlds don't allow it. The others don't really give to much imbalance though if you look at the fact everyone has access to similar PrCs. Even in the base campaign there is a PrC that can give you immunity to just about everything, albeit it they are situational. That's the shifter. Going up against a dev critter or rogue? Shift to a golem or undead shape. Going up against a mage, use rakasha.

@evo<br><br>Yeah...I figured about the same.<br>The PrC's in the orginal game are tested and made well balanced. IMO the PrC's from PRC are not really balanced, atleast most of them are not. Some are made just a bit too strong, so playing it against other (balanced) PrC won't be any fun.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Dimundome on 08/14/04 12:18</span></i></p>
