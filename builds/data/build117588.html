A lot of people I see are making uber builds using monks, and since the server I play at has heavy restrictions, I decided to adapt them to my current build.<br>I call this build: "The Divine Rogue" Dun Dun Dun!<br>So start stats are as follows:<br>Selecting Elf as my char to get +2 to dex at a loss of -2 to con<br>10 STR<br>20 DEX<br>12 CON<br>14 INT<br>8 WIS<br>8 CHA<br>Bear in mind to use divine wrath and the like, you will have to use items that increase CHA, not hard to do, but it can be a pain sometimes.<br>1 Rogue Feat Dodge<br>2 Rogue<br>3 Rogue Weapon Finesse<br>4 Rogue Dex +1<br>5 Rogue<br>6 Rogue Prof* Exotic (Cause I like using whip)<br>7 Rogue<br>8 Rogue Dex +1<br>9 Rogue Focus Whip<br>10 Rogue Imp Evasion or Defensive Roll<br>11 Champion of Torm<br>12 CHoT Expertise, Improved Expertise, Dex +1<br>13 CHoT<br>14 CHoT Knock Down<br>15 CHoT Improved Knockdown<br>16 Rogue Dex +1<br>17 Rogue<br>18 Rogue Improved Critical Whip, Imp. Evasion or Def. Roll<br>19 Rogue<br>20 Rogue Dex +1<br>Stats at Level 20:<br>AB w/ Unmodded Whip: +24/+19/+14/+9<br>Dex: 25 Base<br>21 Rogue Great Dex I, Crippling Strike<br>22 Rogue<br>23 Rogue<br>24 Rogue Great Dex II, Epic Dodge (The prereq. is 25 tumble not 30 tumble) Dex +1<br>25 Rogue<br>26 Rogue<br>27 Rogue Great Dex III<br>28 Rogue Dex +1<br>29 Rogue Self Concealment I<br>30 Rogue Self Concealment II<br>31 Rogue<br>32 Rogue Dex +1<br>33 Rogue Self Concealment III, and IV<br>34 Rogue<br>35 Rogue<br>36 Rogue Armor Skin<br>37 Rogue Self Conceal V<br>38 CHoT Epic Weapon Focus Whip<br>39 CHoT Great Dex IV<br>40 CHoT Epic Prowess<br>Final AC naked no mods at level 40: 32 = 12 Nat + 12 Dex + 8 Tumble<br>Final AB W/Un modded Whip at level 40: +42/+37/+32/+27 = 26 Base + 12 Dex + 3 Focus + 1 Prowess<br>With Improved Expertise it would lower your AB more, but it would make it near impossible for you to be hit.<br>Side Notes: Save Skill points from your Rogue Class to get 43 Disc at level 40; You need 30 Hide and 30 Tumble for the Self Conceal. And you can change the focus, just thought it would be funnier with a whip.<br>If you want to post your Comments feel free to message me at <a href="mailto:Killerkevin66@yahoo.com">Killerkevin66@yahoo.com</a><br>And no, I wont go Weapon Master, That is spammed way too much.<br>-Cheer, Kevin<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 02:58</span></i></p>
