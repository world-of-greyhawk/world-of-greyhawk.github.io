This is a build I posted in the NWN general forum a month ago or so, in answer to a build request. The idea is that of dual kama wielder with a decent AB, with all the rogues tricks up his sleeve: crippling strike, sneak attacks, UMD, epic dodge, trap setting skills (coupled with skill mastery). Add called shot and expertise to help in melee. Fighter brings necessary bonus feats, WS/EWS and the fourth attack per round. And it forces a somehow odd levelling to avoid XP penalty <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br>Skill mastery can be swapped around with slippery mind, according to when you prefer getting one or the other.<br>I was sorry not to have enough skill points to max out concentration too. I too, like Grimm, often find that skillpoints are not enough <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br>Hit points are decent for an epic dodger and saves are not bad either. Skill focus: spellcraft and maxed out spellcraft would add another +1 to saves vs spells, ESF: spellcraft a further +2. If just there was room for it.<br><br>Those that don't care about XP penalty can lvl up in a more straightforward way.<br><br>Enough with my ranting, let the build speak for itself.<br><br><br><b>Monastic Commando - Rogue(19), Monk(11), Fighter(10)</b><br>Human, any lawful alignment<br><i>PvM playable 1-40, untested PvP</i><br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 16 (30)<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 422<br>Skillpoints: 369<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 24/25/33<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4, Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +4, improved evasion, slippery mind<br>BAB: 26<br>AB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 38 (dual wielding kamas), 37 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 34/34<br>Sneak Attack: +10d6<br>Stunning Fist: 11/day DC=32 (38 with maxed WIS)<br><br><b>SKILLS</b><br>Disable Trap 34(38), Discipline 42(43), Hide 43(53), Move Silently 43(53), Open Lock 16(26), Search 41(43), Set Trap 33(45), Spellcraft 18(20), Tumble 40(50), UMD 41(40)<br><br><br><b>LEVELING GUIDE</b><br><br>01: Rogue(1): Two-Weapon Fighting, Ambidexterity<br>02: Fighter(1): Weapon Finesse<br>03: Monk(1): Weapon Focus:Kama,{Cleave,Evasion,Improved Unarmed Strike,Stunning Fist}<br>04: Fighter(2): DEX+1, Expertise, (DEX=17)<br>05: Monk(2): {Deflect Arrows}<br>06: Rogue(2): Toughness<br>07: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>08: Fighter(3): DEX+1, (DEX=18)<br>09: Fighter(4): Blind Fight, Weapon Specialization: Kama<br>10: Monk(3)<br>11: Rogue(4)<br>12: Rogue(5): DEX+1, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, (DEX=19)<br>13: Rogue(6)<br>14: Rogue(7)<br>15: Rogue(8): Improved Critical: Kama<br>16: Rogue(9): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>17: Monk(4)<br>18: Rogue(10): Called Shot, Crippling Strike<br>19: Rogue(11)<br>20: Rogue(12): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br>21: Fighter(5): Epic Weapon Focus: Kama<br>22: Rogue(13): Defensive Roll<br>23: Monk(5)<br>24: Monk(6): DEX+1, Great Dexterity I, {Knockdown, Improved Knockdown}, (DEX=23)<br>25: Fighter(6): Epic Weapon Specialization: Kama<br>26: Fighter(7)<br>27: Monk(7): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=24)<br>28: Monk(8): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br>29: Fighter(8): Armor Skin<br>30: Monk(9): Epic Dodge, {Improved Evasion}<br>31: Rogue(14)<br>32: Rogue(15): DEX+1, (DEX=26)<br>33: Rogue(16): Great Dexterity III, Slippery Mind, (DEX=27)<br>34: Fighter(9)<br>35: Fighter(10): Epic Prowess<br>36: Monk(10): DEX+1, Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=29)<br>37: Rogue(17)<br>38: Rogue(18)<br>39: Monk(11): Epic Will<br>40: Rogue(19): DEX+1, Skill Mastery, (DEX=30)<br><br><br>Feedback and constructive criticism are welcome.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Wait for me Dragon, we'll meet in the sky<br>By fire and magic, I'm sworn<br>Hell is calling, we cannot be denied<br>Fly to the blackness of the Storm<br><br>We must die to be reborn!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 02/25/06 21:20</span></i></p>

Well done again, Kail. But if you need criticism, you must make it more flawed. Well-planned, playable all the way, no xp-penalty and he even gets important feats quite early. He is just the way he should be. Impressive saves and damage output for a dex base dual-kama.<br><br>As a sidenote me and finn just had a chat today about the fact you haveing been somewhat absent lately. No wonder, since planning this must've been hard. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Skills are not enough!?, I would be happy to get half that amount of skills.<br><br>Hmmmmm, I suppose you want to counter your lack of damage with sneak attack... seems pretty good idea, stunning fist DC is low enough for you not to even try to hit unarmed, no need for it, you go with kamas, and it's great that you have called shot if you want to go ranged, but you have no WF on ranged.<br><br>I don't get it, why Expertise? I've only used that feat to get to Weapon Master, your AB is good, but you can't lose it on that or you won't hit.<br><br>Your AC works better with Monk armor and dual wield, forget the shield and the mundane armor.<br><br>Maybe you could lower Monk level to 9 to increase sneak attack by 1d6 with rogue or another feat with fighter.<br><br>I't very good methinks.

<b>Grim, Finn</b>, thanks for the kind words. I value your opinion and I am therefore pleased to see this build being considered a good one by the two of you. Answering your side note, Grim, I've been busier than usual but I'm still alive and kicking <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  ...altough the news about Manowar postponing the tour and Karl Logan's accident hit me hard <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br><b>Thax</b>, as Finn noted the AC "issue" comes from Kamiryn's spreadsheet standard output, I'm not planning to use any armor but monk's robes in the build. <br>Answering your other points:<br><br>*skill points: even though rogues get plenty of it, with all the skills to max out they are never enough, even dropping all RP related skills and looking only from a utilitarian point of view. I would have loved to max out concentration to resist those pesky taunters <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>* adding sneak attack and WS/EWS is a good (and somehow standard) way to make up for low damage output in dexers<br><br>* stunning fist can be useful on lower lvls or with capped WIS but it's there as icing on the cake, nothing to base your fighting strategy on<br><br>*called shot: arm lowers your opponent AB and coupled with the effect of crippling strike is soo nasty <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  Called shot leg with ranged weapons is usable since the build is a dexer, altough due to the lack of weapon foci you hit at -3 AB compared to single wielding kama but only -1 AB compared to dualwielding them.<br><br>*expertise is a useful feat when you need a 20 to hit, it gives you +5 AC at no cost in that case. It also rises your AC when/if you decide to set traps on the fly while meleeing<br><br>*10 Monk is for AC bump, 11 for poison immunity (since 11 FTR or 20 Rogue had to ofer only 2 HP but -2 skillpoints or 4 skillpoints but -2 HP). Two more FTR lvls at the expense of Monk means xp penalty, but the additional feat would make room for ESF: spellcraft f.e. It's worth considering. As for +1d6 sneak, I think 10d6 to be enough, not worth -1 AC and poison immunity IMO.<br><br><br><b>DarkInferno</b>, true about my obsession but I believe the unealthy part of it is on the receiver side <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> <br><br><b>Dwarflord</b>, I humbly ask, familiar to what?<br><br>Thank you all for the feedback, fellow posters!<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Wait for me Dragon, we'll meet in the sky<br>By fire and magic, I'm sworn<br>Hell is calling, we cannot be denied<br>Fly to the blackness of the Storm<br><br>We must die to be reborn!

Sorry if you felt offended in any way, not my intention (I know you know a lot for past corrections on me), I just found it too weird that it said mundane armor/shield.<br><br>My point on stunning fist is that to fight unarmed is very worse than two kamas, even though stunning low saves enemies is a sure win. You have it nevertheless, no point arguing too much about it.
