So, I had an idea for a character, but I'm not entirely sure how I want to set this up. Basically I'm looking for a PC that would be an agent and sleuth for his liege, and capable of swashbuckling his/her way out of trouble if things got sticky. <br><br>I'm leaning to human for setting/RP reasons. I can't tank charisma because I need to be able to charm from time to time (regardless of gender) so bard is probably useful in the mix... but the PC will go places arcane magic is frowned upon, so the agent will have to be able to handle things with minimal buffs sometime.<br><br>Playable PvE with some PvP (at least able to fight long enough to escape...) levels 1-30 (soft cap at 30, so beyond that is nice, but gravy).<br><br>Alignment doesn't matter (on the g/e axis, that is), but no monks (seeing as bard would probably be in, and this is for a PW, monk/bard wouldn't fly anyway).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By RangerSG on 08/29/08 13:12</span></i></p>

Any rules on how many levels in a class you need to take? I'm thinking of something like Bard/FTR/SD. Only 2 SD levels for HiPS so you can get out of Dodge when needed. The second level is for Evasion and Uncanny Dodge (I figure you're looking at DEX-based for this guy). A drawback for the DEX-based approach is very low damage though. FTR levels with WS and EWS can help there.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

That's what I was thinking about too. Definitely the WS feats would help, improved crit if I could fit it in too. The rules are no opposed align shifts and 5 lvls of any prestige class before 30. I was vacillating between rogue/bard/sd and fighter/bard/sd because I'm not sure if I want the skill points and sneak dmg or the sustained dmg and higher AB.<br><br>And yeah, just for theme, I'm thinking dex-based on this one. I have a hard time imagining a hulking musketeer <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  Though as long as dex is high enough that I could see the PC as nimble, that would suffice for that, I think. Though with a bard's stats spread thin anyway, that still probably leaves not too much choice.<br><br>Thanks, Cin <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

How about a different approach? I'm thinking Rogue 13 / Fighter 10 / Weapon Master 7 at level 30, and all Rogue after that, DEX-based, weapon of choice: rapier. Perhaps another 6 levels of WM after level 30 to choose a second weapon of choice (like dagger). You might even be able to work in dual-wielding. Start with STR 12, DEX 16, CON 12, WIS 8, INT 14, and CHA 14, and put all points into DEX.<br>_________________<br>Great Research Tools:<br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWNWiki</a><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">NWN Epic Character Build Search Engine</a><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/" target="_blank">The NWN Vault</a>

Hmm, that would be interesting too. Either build is going to be a tad feat-starved. But that looks like it would be fun as well. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Thanks.

Empyre,<br><br>So I ran through a test build on this. And I got dual-wielding np. She ended up having 25dex, but getting it too late for ED before the cap. I don't want to knock off the Con because it rolled @ 216HP, and that's shaving it close with a non-HiPS rogue that would have to stand up in combat occasionally. Though w/ KD and a 33/29 (or 31/31 w/ 2 rapiers) AB w/ mundane weapons and 7d6 sneaks she'd be able to hold her own reasonably well, I think.<br><br>What I was thinking was shaving str to 10, she really isn't going to need it, as I see it, her dmg is going to come from sneaks and crits. Landing ED 3 levels earlier, however, would be useful to her. What do you think?

I estimate that without any changes, you should be able to get ED right at level 30. You need 2 Great DEX feats to do this. To raise starting DEX by 1 point from 16, you would have to take 3 points from elsewhere, not just 2.<br><br>Another idea would be to drop Weapon Master, and make it Rogue 19 / Fighter 11 at level 30, and all Rogue except 1 more Fighter level after that, ending at Rogue 28 / Fighter 12. If you time it so that you get Rogue 19 at level 28, you can get ED then, with the same starting DEX.<br>_________________<br>Great Research Tools:<br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWNWiki</a><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">NWN Epic Character Build Search Engine</a><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/" target="_blank">The NWN Vault</a>

drat, I forgot about the 3rd point...yeah. Scratch that. I'll have to work on the post epic run again. And I'd rather go w/ WM, or something that would be a good 5 level choice, like Harper Scout(?) then go straight rogue/fighter.<br><br>Thanks again <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
