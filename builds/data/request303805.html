*points above*<br><br>Never tried one before, und when I did it failed miserably. I play on a low-mid magic level PW, +5 weapons/gear are VERY rear and VERY expensive, no perma haste as well. There is also a lvl CAP of 30 (max character level is 30 and no exceptions).<br><br>Got myself a standart WM build (I must say those dwarven waraxe crits are delicious <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">  ) and some buffers mages. Tho at epic, all non-insta-death spells become usualess,  and one can only buff himself, his fominates, summons and companions.<br><br>What I really want and need now is a combat orientated cleric. Don't care 'bout 'em DCs, heals and buffs are the name of the game. The thing is I just don't know how to build one? Should I get CHA for Divine Might/Shield? How much WIS is enaugh? How to multiclass? <br><br>I have next to none experience in building clerics, so if anyone could drop me a build or a link to one, I'd appreciate it very much.<br><br>P.S. And yes, I have red the Stickyes above 'bout clerics, and gotten some basic ideas about them, but that is not enaugh to build a decent character.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By tacka on 12/01/08 13:09</span></i></p>

Aye, I have, but most builds there are orientated to reach the peak of their power at +30 lvl ( Level 9 buffs, dev. Crit., etc.).<br><br>I'm also not so sure what builds should I consider "good".<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By tacka on 12/01/08 18:19</span></i></p>

Heals and buffs? Then you only need 19 or 20 WIS max. Go with something like:<br><br>Dwarf<br><br>STR 16<br>DEX 10<br>CON 16<br>INT 10<br>WIS 16<br>CHA 6<br><br>For domains, go with Trickery (for Improved Invis) and either Healing (for the improved cure wounds spells), Travel (for Haste), or Magic (for Stoneskin and some other goodies.<br><br>Take at least 20 CLC levels, and whatever else you like to augment it. FTR is good, as is Rogue (but you'll get a penalty if you stick with Dwarf on that. Go Human in that case), or even Bard and some RDD for the boosts (again, Human to avoid XP penalties, and you'll not be able to get all 10 RDD levels unless you sacrifice some CLC. Maybe CLC 18/Bard 2/RDD 10). Or, you could opt for pure CLC (well, maybe CLC 29 and one level for a skill dump. Bard or Rogue).<br><br>Feats: Weapon Focus, Extend Spell, Toughness, Weapon Proficiency Exotic or Marshal (if not taking FTR) for a better weapon selection, Blind Fight and whatever else you like. Epic levels, go for Epic Prowess, Epic Weapon Focus, Armor Skin, and GRT STR feats. If you want you could look at Combat Casting and Improved Combat Casting (take away AoOs if you need to cast in combat to heal).<br><br>Skills: Concentration or Spellcraft and Tumble.<br><br>Just a few quick thoughts.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

*cough*<br><br>I would go Human.. High WIS. Mostly Cleric levels and a couple Monk levels for skill dumps.<br><br>Also if you're talking about the server I think you are.. You might also want to consider MAX Cleric and the Animal + Travel domains.

As has been stated many times in different places, CLERICS ARE GOD"S CHOSEN ONES!  I dont think you can make a bad cleric, as long as your wisdom score says 19 without gear (assume lv 17 cleric or higher).  Even then, taking 15 cleric in a 30 or 40 lvl build gives you +5 gear!  Not expensive!  Not at all...  (sorry, if you dont knoow me, I LIKE CLERICS!  I didnt even realize that bioware made other classes for nearly 2 years... jk  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  )<br><br>If i may be so bold, your cleric sucked because you arent used to playing clerics.  Taking from what you say, you like the IDEA of a fighter type meleer... wade into combat and kill then move on.  Am i right?   (dwarven wm's are all about that play style).<br><br>Clerics are different.  FIRST, 3/4 ab means they NEED ab.  Unlike every other class (cept maybe bard), they can make up for this with 2 casts (instant 10 ab at lv 15 or higher, regardless of wisdom - as long as you can cast lv 4 spells).  There are other buffs that can get you to almost the 20 ab cap.  SO, with a cleric, ab isnt really a concern.  <br><br>AC with a cleric, again, isnt really that tough either.  You can make a +5 tower, +5 armor, Deflection ac, +3dodge ac... plus imm to paralysis etc.   THere are so many options.<br><br>Then, you can use AoE things like SoV, firestorm, earthquake.  Vs undead you have Heals, vs human Harm...  <br><br>Bottom line, you cant just wade in (well, you can if you understand clerics LOL).  Ever notice those pesky clerics casting BEFORE they begin a combat?  That's what you must get in the habit of doing.  IF you treat your cleric like a fighter, you will suck.  <br><br>Now, to answer your question, if i have ONLY 30 lvls, take straight cleric 30.  Get wis to 19 and pump str as much as you can (even consider Half orc so you can start with more str!).  If you want more ac, take 2 lvls of rogue or bard (dep on alignment) at 21 and 30 for the tumble boosts, and possibly umd.   You want to have this high of cleric so your buffs dont get striped as you wade into combat and you end up a fighter with crappy ab.<br><br>Feats?  I would focus on wf(in weapon - and ewf and IC), EXTEND SPELL IS YOUR FRIEND.  Blind fight.  I would consider taking Spell focus, gr and epic in Evocation... depending.  If dev crit is available, i would do a halforc with str 20, wis 15 and get dev crit at 21 (with fighter 1 - then do cleric27/ftr1/rog2).  You wouldnt get lv 9 spells til late, but youwould be very tough.  <br><br>There is so much more to suggest, but clerics take alittle bit of practice to get.  Trust me.  I have personally taken a dude along with my PRC cleric build who really like that build.  We went out and i SHOWED him the tricks of the trade, so to speak.  You know, 2 weeks later, he pmd me saying he was having troubles with the build!  And i trained him personally!!!

I would seriously consider getting a tumble dump in there.  Cleric26/fighter2/rogue2 sounds tasty, though you'd have to be human to avoid the XP penalty (not counting, of course, the half-pointy eareds (because they don't count...)).  Depending on environment, I'd still be tempted to go dwarf* and eat the penalty, but either way...  That gets you the full cleric line, undispellability, and two cleric bonus feats.  Fighter gets you weapon profs, and two bonus feats.  Rogue gets you skill dumps, evasion, and a teensy bit of SA.<br><br>As far as how to play, buffing is your friend.  Wake up every day to the long term buffs.  Don't forget to buff your armor and shield.  As avado mentions, you can buff the pants off your AC (that makes sooo little sense...).  Then, don't forget the short term buffs.  Divine Favor and Divine Power alone will turn you into an instrument of death.  Prayer, Battletide, these things are just gravy.  If all that isn't enough, you can break out the SoVs, Firebrands, Harms, and Implosions.  It really just isn't fair what the cleric is capable of doing.<br><br>Remember, you can make your own +5 gear, so if you can get a weapon with little to no enhancement, but other props, so much the better.  Ditto for armor.  Yes, when it seems like clerics couldn't possibly offer you anything more, there it is.

Its not so much even with being dispelled (but that is a point).  A combat cleric is redundant.  A cleric IS a combat cleric.  I have built a purely wisodm based cleric, what would be considered a "caster", yet he rocked in melee better than alot of my other characters.  Their buffs and spells are designed for this.<br><br>When i suggested the 27 cleric levels, it was for the buff durations (with extend, 54 units).  IN a lv 30 world, this is godly (esp in low magic).  One of my other points was that, for clerics, there is no such thing as low magic world!

Wow, nice builds! Thanks mates, now all I gotta do is get the ropes of playing a cleric. <br><br>I'll take the majority of levels in Cleric class, a one or two Fighter for combat focus, and a few rogue for that juicy Tumble AC bonus. I buff before combat with long term, extended spells and use short duration ones in combat. <br><br>Now all i gotta do is make a RP for the build and I am ready to go. <br><br>Thanks again!

Quick thing concerning extend.  Cast your Hour/levels normally, extend your turn/levels (so they last as long as you hour/levels (which may be unnecessary at higher levels)), and extend your round/levels.<br><br>Also, sometimes you want to extend, or not, for spellbook management.  Like, say you want more extended divine favors (because you always want more extended divine favors...).  You can extend you BS, Owl's, or whatever else, so that they occupy third level slots.  You don't really need to extend hour/levels, but if it gives you more of what you want (those yummy, yummy, extended divine favors...), then it's worthwhile.

LOL  We thinks alike..  go figure with a party of 3 clerics, wasnt it!  LOL<br><br>Spell book management is a very important thing.  Here is an example: i always cast my buffs extended, like bulls and endurance, just so i have an awareness about when they will wear off (usually longer than between rests).  I would put vestment in that category too, as well as darkfire and greater magic weapon.  i cant recall if shield of faith is long duration (hr/lv or if it is turn/lv)   either way, i would extend it.  I AlWAYS have, after lv 11 or so, ALL lv 1 spells as Div favours..  no other lvl 1 needed, imho.  The other is a lv 4, so like onion says, you can either have it as lv 4 or ext lv 5.  I usually have 10 or so (which can be overkill) on both levels.  <br><br>You have others like true sight, freedom of movement, things like that.  You pick and choose based on the circumstances.<br><br>The other thing is undeadies.  Whenever i find undeads, my upper lvl slots change to accomodate.  I usually have 6 slots as harm.  In undead they become heals.  Mass heal is excellent as long as you are comfortable with HERDING (a long lost cleric strategy).  I usually like my lv 9 as sov and lv 8 as firestorm/mass heal.  <br><br>There is one other feat, wrt spell book that any good cleric will consider.  I came upon this from this forum a few years ago and i must say, it is a great one.  Take either silent or still spell.  Either of them is fine because you arent really worried about them for what they do as a feat.  What we care about is that they give us one level higher slot.  I usually take still with bard/clr/pm things, otherwise i use silent.  See, ext is nice, but you cant extend those instant ones, ie HEAL/HARM.  So, wrt spell book management, this allows you and extra row of harms/heals when they are really needed.  Get the idea? (wow, i must be lookin at retirement when i give THIS one away!!)  LOL<br><br>Now, you have almost all the secrets of the cleric.  Go out and kill in the name of God...

Shield of Faith is turn/level, so, yeah, extend it.  I don't always extend DF, GMW, or MV, only depending on circumstance.  The stat buffs, however, pretty much always get extended.  I'm perfectly happy w/ nothing but extended DFs for second level slots.  Man, if only there was a spontaneous divine caster in standard NWN...<br><br>I can definitely concur w/ the silent spell suggestion.  I've played around a bunch with it, and though it may not be the sexy choice, it's worth it.  Upper level slots can be a pain.  Extend isn't all that helpful (though it does have it's uses, i.e., blade barriers and greater sancts).  The freedom silent (or still, if ya got some bard in ya) grants you is a great luxory.<br><br>And, yup, three clerics.  Shame we didn't go after more of a challenge.  Mine was a version of Blood and Faith.  Nasty, nasty, nasty.  Incidentally, on WoG, upper level summons are actually useful.  I fairly regularly use summon VIII or IX, especially when playing split stat clerics (which is most of the time...).  But, I digress.
