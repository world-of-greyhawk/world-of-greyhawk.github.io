A little guide on this often underestimated class.<br><br>Bards are often dispised because they are not "ultimate". They can't stop time with their spells, they can't receive hits and damage like a fighter or a barbarian, they don't get anything really unique to them that one could safely call "uber". More often than not, bard levels are used to gain palemaster or RDD levels.<br><br>But bards have two Grand things that makes them unique :<br>-The bardic song, the best buff that exists in the whole NWN game.<br>-The incredibly versatile abilities, by an unusual selection of combat feats (medium armor and shields), BAB, skill selection and skill points, and spellcasting abilities that extend further than paladin and ranger.<br><br>These abilities make the bard character what he is : a character people generally don't want to play, but one people often want to play with. Too bad for them, they don't know what they're missing.<br><br>The bards have two cons :<br>-They have nothing uber. They're at most good at each thing (except singing).<br>-Their stats spreads are harsh. A tanking bard needs 4 abilities, and only one (wisdom) can truly be sacrificed. The archer bard survives better with only 3 important stats.<br><br><br>Alignement Restriction : Non-Lawful. Too bad for the monk and paladin class (especially the latter one).<br><br>Hit Dice : D6. Quite low for a tanking class, but spells and the song will help increase the AC quite high. A pure tanking bard will still have problems with his HP.<br><br>BAB : 3/4. As good as a monk, cleric or rogue. With only 4 levels in a tanking class, you can get the 4th attack, leaving enough bard levels to have fun.<br><br>Prefered Saving Throws : Reflex and Will. Lacks fortitude, too bad if you plan a tanking bard, but again, the song and spells will save the day. Oh, and don't underestimate the bonus from spellcraft.<br><br>Skill Points per level : 4+int. A bit too low, considering their large skill selection.<br><br>Class Skills :<br>Concentration : Classic, and useful for casting in melee.<br>Discipline : Well, nice ! The one tanking skill, and we have it !<br>Heal, Listen, Lore , Parry, Persuade, Taunt : I won't detail.<br>Hide, Move Silently : Cool, we can even be a sneaky character !<br>Perform : A must have ; I won't detail<br>Pick Pocket : The thieves' skill. We really ARE versatile.<br>Spellcraft : Well, the one spellcasting skill, what are we again ?<br>Use Magic Device : The cheese on the cake. Even Shadowdancer doesn't have it.<br><br>Class abilities :<br>-Bardic Knowledge : Nice, but let's face it, it's more for roleplay.<br>-Arcane Spellcasting : 6th level spells at most, you're not the time stopper or anything, but some of the buffing spells are of incredible power. And if you want, you can still toss fireballs at higher levels.<br>-Bard Song : The best buff, no questions asked. It even includes your allies, no limit, and with curse song, you can choose to weaken your enemies.<br><br>Multiclass options :<br>-Rogue : The skill points help, and the skill selection, although not really needed, helps too. But the roles don't mix so nicely.<br>-Barbarian/Fighter : Classics for a tank bard, BAB and martial weapons help, and the rage and the fighter free feats are always good to take. Uncanny dodge can also be important.<br>-Paladin : Despite the alignement issue, it's a good mix for the charisma synergy, along with the BAB and martial weapons.<br>-Arcane Archer : A classic class for bards (especially archer bards). They are better at it than rangers and wizards, and make a great combo with a fighter or a shadowdancer.<br>-Red Dragon Disciple : Good choice for a tanking bard, although you still need a good BAB class somewhere.<br>-Blackguard : Same as paladin, except there is no alignement issue. You need 13 Strengh though, for Power Attack.<br>-Champion of Torm : Charisma helps here, and the weapons are always welcome.<br>_________________<br>If you call IGMS, Harm, Mestil's acid shield, the Bigby hands or Devastating Critical balanced in your post, don't expect me to like you.<br><br>I'm sorry about my bad english, I'm french.<br>In every lie lies a part of truth.
