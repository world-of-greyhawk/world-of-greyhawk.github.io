I noticed a long while back that you can have some of the monkish feats without actually being a monk.<br>So I had this idea to try to make a monk-like character without any monk levels.<br><br>Apologies in advance if something along these lines has been done already, but short of going through every build, I don't know of a way to check if this concept has been tried.<br><br><b>Flavour Text</b><br><br><i>The monk from no temple is like the wolf from no pack.

the year was 2006.  That's when you shoulda played.  Arguably the best, most creative year of the guild's history.  <br><br>If i were you, id study griz' builds.  Most are near perfect (near cuz i have my own playstyle).  THe build griz did had the highest stun fist dc you could get and not one monk lvl to be found.  <br><br>One thing though, about your building: dont waste feats.  Rapier doesnt fit with a monk idea.  I know you need a weapon to qual for COT, use Kama.  Its a concept thing.

So it's not that people are any less creative, it's that most of the stuff has been done when you think you have a cool idea.

AH nuts!  I just took a close look at the stunner build and you have to be aware that you need to move Epic dodge to lv 27 for tumble 30.  This is one of those "illegal" pre-1.69 builds as is.  Fortunately, the fix is so minor it is laughable!
