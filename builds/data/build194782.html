<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>"There lie the woods of Lothlórien!' said Legolas. 'That is the fairest of all the dwellings of my people. There are no trees like the trees of that land. For in the autumn their leaves fall not, but turn to gold. Not till the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall, and then the boughs are laden with yellow flowers; and the floor of the wood is golden, and golden is the roof, and its pillars are of silver, for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey. So still our songs in Mirkwood say.

I couldnt test properly the save part as in the novice to epic mod, the wizard just rushed me in melee without casting anything <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">      <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">    .<br>I tried first to go harper scout, since the needed feats were doing nice with this build( iron will &amp; alertness ), but i couldnt solve the lack of feats...<br><br>The main problem of this build remains the dmg part ( 1-8+2d6 against favored enemies ), which basically will all depend of the available gear. An alternative would be to go rogue instead of bard to have an extra d6 sneak btw.<br> But I think it makes a nice buddy for your shadow archer, Syrath <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Anglashell on 05/12/05 17:32</span></i></p>

Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't favored enemy bonuses stack?  For each favored enemy feat=+1/+1.  So 5 would give you +5/+5 +2d6Bane+base+any other goodies.  <br><br>Also, at the risk of compromising your Lothlorien concept, you could always drop Ranger and take Fighter.  You'd be able to get all the same feats and them some.  You could have, with WS/EWS, +6damage vs everything instead of conditional opponents, you could then, of course, take 3 more levels of Shadowdancer for 1 more bonus feat, and the fighter levels would even allow you to take the ALertness/Ironwill prereqs for the Harper Scout.  This would give you 2 Great Dex bonus feats in Epic, allow you to take Epic Dodge at 21st lvl, and start picking up your SC Feats by around lvl 29.  You could still maintain the integrity of the "Scout" concept because, well, he would be a Harper "Scout".<br>_________________<br>Homer: Lisa, would you like a donut? <br>Lisa: No thanks.

You could still take it a bit earlier than in this case, but with a light loss of ba. But the problem of the damage output would remain the same even if less important as you could have a better strength from the beginning. It would be something like 1-8+6+2 from st for example vs a 1-8+5+2d6.<br>It's true that favored enemy is quite restrictive, but I thought by choosing human, elves, dwarves, undead, and dragon for example, you would cover most of the encounters, as you dont really need extra dmg vs orcs or weaker creatures. Ranger26/sd13/bard1 would have been a bit more efficient, as it would have given same extra dmg as weapon specialization and another favored enemy, unfortunately, the sc feat isnt on the list of the ranger bonus feat.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Anglashell on 05/12/05 23:29</span></i></p>

Well said, and therein lies the rub that I face with all my builds: I want offensive but yet I want defensive.  I think no matter what, you want to keep SC V in the build.  That, with Epic Dodge, is what will win your encounters.  I think that as long as you can hit your opponent and do damage, then you'll win 9/10.  However, I fear this guy would be dead meat against things with medium to high DR or quick healing.  <br><br>I wouldn't worry about it, though.
