On Badlands 3129 Time Stop is nerfed, making it a fairly reasonable spell, as opposed to an utterly ridiculous one.  It's set for 1d4+2 seconds, and a DC 60 Will save to either resist, or for the caster to melee.  It does not stop the whole server.  It has a large AoE.  It ignores SR.<br><br>The idea here, is to make a build that can cast Time Stop, have a very good chance to consistently make the DC 60 Will save, and then melee against the people caught in it who presumably can't make the Will save.<br><br>The build would preferrably be a dual kama, with max apr, since 3-6 (1d4+2) seconds is 1-2 of the 3 melee flurries in each round, and with max apr you get 4 attacks in the first flurry, using flurry of blows (that's a lot of flurries!).  The idea being, to get as many attacks on your opponents as possible during each Time Stop, since you probably will have between 6 and 10 at most to cast each rest.<br><br>Assume that you can craft gear for +12 to 5 of your ability scores comfortably.  2 rings will add a total of +10 to 2 of your saves, and the best Will save on a helm is +3.<br><br>You will want a high Discipline score as well, so Epic Skill Focus Discipline is a MUST.  Disarmers abound, and Bigby's Grasping Hand rolls off of Discipline, and the possibility of being caught and pick pocketed or disarmed is something you would want to avoid. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>I already have a build that can regularly hit the DC and melee, and another in the works, but I'd be interested to see what some of you guys (or gals?) come up with for a Time Stop meleer.<br><br>Feel free to ask if you need more info, or if I left anything out that might help.

Seems a tough one to me.

Not to make it any tougher, yeah right.<br><br>I know you don't <b>need</b> 60, you actually need no more than 58 since rolling a 1 fails automatically.<br><br>Hmmm, the other usual high saves build I play is a Druid shifter, but you can't cast Time Stop while shifted so it's just as useless...<br><br>Okay then let's count and do it correctly, taking 3 classes that have Will as their high save you can get a base save of 16 pre-epic (16/2/2 spread), add +10 in epics, +6 from Iron Will and Epic Will and you'd end with a 32 base Will save, suppose you have only 14 WIS and capped to 26 your Will raises up to 40, +13 from your items you can get 53, it's not bad.<br><br>Champion of Torm actually doesn't has Will as its high save, and since you'll use the epic levels on the caster class then there's no real point in taking Champion of Torm. For high Will save there's Sorcerer, Monk, Cleric, Harper Scout, Druid, Bard, Dwarven Defender, Red Dragon Disciple, Wizard, Pale Master...<br><br>You could take Monk / Sorcerer / Red Dragon Disciple, it's a nice combination and all, but you want more BAB for APR right? if Divine Power doesn't work I have another idea.<br><br>One way is to take Dwarven Defender, it's the only high BAB class that has Will as high save, so it allows you to get the 53 Will the way I wrote it up there. Too bad Defensive Stance won't work while casting, that's a wasted +2.<br><br>Another choice is to take a route low on Paladin levels, only for Divine Grace and BAB, so you don't lose too much on your base saves. Let me count, the best spread is Monk 8 / Paladin 10 / Sorcerer 2 pre-epic for 12 base Will, that's 4 points below the best save so it would reach 49 Will save with 14 WIS, plus your bonus from Charisma, which has to be at least 19 to cast Time Stop, cap it and your Will save gets to 59, done. Actually, I think it's best to leave it at 58, so you can lower pre-epic Monk to 4 raising Paladin to 14 and get 1 BAB in exchange of 1 Will save. Oh well, in the end you can take a lot of Paladin after all... raise base CHA to 20 and you can take more Paladin to get the Paladin spells.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 04/29/08 03:12</span></i></p>

The Paladin/Bg route definitely makes the DC more attainable.  Combining one of those with Sor sounds natural too, but I actually came pretty close to the 60 DC with a Monk 9 Bg 10 Wiz 21.  I went Wiz instead of Sor for more skill points, and since you basically get 4x Great Int for free, it's easier on the starting stats.  I went Bg instead of Pal because 10 Bg also gave me 3d6 sneaks, which, while not a whole lot, do come in handy as people are flat when caught in Time-Stop.<br><br>I ended up with 56 Will, which is passable, considering 14 Wis and 10 Cha for base stats.  I escaped pre-epic with only 12 base Will (!).  So, 22 Base +8 Wis +7 Feats (LoH, Iron Will, Epic Will) +10 Rings +6 Cha +3 Helm = 56.  Having started with 18 dex and putting all points into that, I ended up with 75ac buffed (with Epic Mage Armor), and with 26 bab got 48ab dual wielding, 63 with true strike.  46ab with flurry of blows is actually pretty good vs Time-Stopped opponents, I'm finding.<br><br>I did another one with Sor instead of Wiz, and that hit the 60 DC no problem, but I lost a lot of skill points.  On the Wiz version, I had enough skill points for Taunt and corner sneaking, for when I run out of Time-Stops, hehe.  I like having as diverse a skill-set as possible, and am trying to figure out how to lose a feat in epic for a skilldump/esf to take epic traps too... <br><br>Also trying to work out a Time-Stop/Harm build...  any suggestions on that one? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">

My build up there already does Time Stop plus Harm, but you and your 60 Will save DC...<br><br>Well, Harm attempt works on your STR modifier, so it's only natural to boost it as much as possible, you won't need Monk on that one, so if you have a Cleric / Sorcerer you could add either Fighter to free epic feats for Great Strentgh or Red Dragon Disciple for natural STR boost. Time Stop is a level 9 spell and Harm is level 6 (unless you want to try it as a Druid, then it's 7), so you can do with a Cleric 12 / Sorcerer 18 / Red Dragon Disciple 10. Taking only 4 RDD levels boost your STR +4, that can be a variant to get more spells.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

guys, not to be a party pooper, but look at it this way.  FIrst, the server dudes made Time stop adjusted so as to be usable.  Second, it appears they have manipulated ALOT in order to keep balance (WHO THE &amp;**( would play a server where Div Power is nerfed!  It is THE balance spell for clerics, and those that say no are lyin to you!).  So, me thinks that maybe, just maybe, these dudes have already noticed bg/pal exploit.  I am guessing that this has been forbidden to!  It is extremely easy to do, just prevent alignment shifts!  THis would also stop pal/pms, pal/bards etc.  I know you seem to be set with this server, but honestly, how on earth can you play a server that has no respect for clerics!!?  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br><br>just havin fun....<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

I'll argument the Paladin / Blackguard / Sorcerer build anytime to be a powerful saves build, leave me be. Anyway, I won't start a debate about Divine Power being nerfed with you, it's pointless, like we're going to ever convince each other... but what if you're not the Cleric build? then you won't want your enemies to have it, there are many other classes still available.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

I think the Divine Power debate is a bad one to have, too, but I think it's enough to say Clerics are the only class capable of hitting the ab cap for extended periods of time with ease, while also being able to heal away damage many, many times before dying.<br><br>But yeah, the basic idea behind the requirements for the Time-Stop build is to either hit, or come close to hitting the DC consistently without special 'helpers' like alignment changes.
