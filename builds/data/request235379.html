Which means, go away Cinn!   (just kidding) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Anyway -- think for that one I will do a mostly Monk toon.  I realize the best combo prolly would be the Monk/Cleric/SD.<br>That will be a build I will do just for me (especially since we do have a variety of Monk/Cleric builds around).  So .. for<br>that house char, I think it would be fun to see what a mostly Monk type character could do.  Am still messing around<br>with possibilities in my head.<br><br>Like Monk 35/SD 5.  That's the mostly pure one...the 5 SD levels allowing me to get Epic Dodge.<br><br>Or a slight variation .. Monk 34/SD5/Rogue 1..the last one as a dump for UMD.  or Monk 33/SD5/Rogue 2..start off with<br>Rogue (for skill points) and end with the Rogue level for skill dump.  Either way I'd probably see if I can also go for SC V,<br>which would give me my 50% conceal. <br><br>If not, I may try to go for a caster class which would give me it.  Like:<br><br>Monk 28/Wiz 7/SD 5.  Or Monk 28/Bard 7/SD 5.  Or .. Monk 26/Assassin 9/SD 5.  The Assassin class can cast<br>Improved Invisibilty, but I have no idea how many castings or how long it lasts.  The others it last for 1 Turn/level.<br><br>What it amounts to is this:  I want Epic Dodge with the 50% Self Conceal.  Just wondering if the strongest char would be the Monk/SD with the Self Conceal V feats (if it is even possible) or the Monk/SD/Some sort of Caster build which will give me that 50% concealment..<br><br>Opinions welcomed!<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Joe

Erm, Monks get Empty Body which gives them 50% concealment. It's undispellable, too. I'm not sure if the Monk/SD/Caster that has II is sensible <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Anyway, have you tried the search engine?<br>_________________<br>"Ever notice how wizards think all life in the Realms dances on their hands and lasts from day to day only because they work constantly to keep us all alive?

Er, yes, I've checked the Epic Builder search engine.  None had exactly what I was looking for.<br><br>Is a 20+ level Monk/5 SD/ (another class here) possible to optain both Epic Dodge and SC V?

Just wondering. </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>First, don't bother with SCV - you have Empty Body, which does the same thing for 1 round per monk level, 2 times per day. With 30+ monk levels, that's 60+ rounds, will be more than enough for most situations.<br><br>Second, if you go dex-based, I highly recommend some fighter levels for WS/EWS to boost your damage output. So Monk 30/Fighter 5/SD 5 would work well, can get Epic Dodge and WS/EWS for some damage potential, plus the 6th attack per round. Human or Dwarf work with no XP penalty.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Still debating on the Cleric levels for Improved Invis/Res/Rez/Heal, etc stuff or just go more Monk instead. <br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>If you want to go with Cleric and go Wisdom-based, I recommend stopping at 6 or 9 monk levels and using kamas. <br>As long as potions are available, you don't really need the healing (unless you are on a rest-restricted server). As noted above, monks don't need II thanks to Empty Body, and it wouldn't last long anyway with low caster level (neither would the other buffs). If you want to use buffing spells to decent effect, you need a lot of caster levels, which is why I recommend only taking 6-9 monk levels in such a build.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>As for either Assassin's Improved Invisibility or the Monk's Empty Body for it's concealment .. aren't both very limited on times per day you can use it and for duration? </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>You can use it 2 times per day, for 1 round per level. You don't want to activate it immediately after resting, but you can activate it at the start of combat and it will usually last the battle. So as long as you rest after 2 significant battles, you have enough. With your high AC as a dex-based monk, you may not want to bother activating it every battle (i.e. don't waste it on weaker mobs). <br><br>Also, II can be dispelled by dispel magic, Mord's disjunction, see invisible, invisibility purge, or true seeing. Empty body is unaffected by any of those. <br><br>TM

Thanks for the advice all .. keep 'em coming!<br><br>HS, eh?  Interesting.  Haven't considered that one before.  It does have possibilities.

I use Rogue for my path to Epic Dodge-dom and use the SD level for the cheesy HIPS. The good part about this is I can get some (albeit minor) sneak damage.

Kinda a variation of the first build, except again I use Rogue on me way to Epic Dodge and this time I get UMD.<br><br>And this one I just thought of, prolly a bit feat starved, but what they hey..will throw it out anyway:<br><br>Monk 28/WM 7/SD 5.

You don't lose any Monk feats, and pick up 2 more sneak dice and a Rogue bonus feat (Crippling Strike), plus some more skillpoints.

You get the extra attack and EWS to deal with sneak-resistant mobs, and decent sneak damage on top for the rest. Probably the best in straight out combat of the ones listed.

With a normal kama, you will only do 1-6, or a max of 18 on a crit. Even with say a +7 kama, you will only do 1-6 + 7 = 8-13, or 24-39 on a crit. Compare that to the one above (M25/F5/Ro10), that has 1-20 + 6 (EWS) + 5d6 sneak = 12-56 on a normal hit, and 19-82 on a crit. And that's with no damage from gloves.<br><br>TM
