I honestly wouldn't bother pumping your CHA.  It's only going to be useful for a couple once a day special attacks you won't use much of anyway, and even then, your CHA still isn't something to right home about.  Yes, potions of eagle's splendor and CHA raising items would help, but your probably not going to want to waste slots on items raising a stat for a once a day attack.<br><br>That will give you a few extra points to play with.  If you leave it at like 8, you could boost your STR to 16.  Or even leave it all the way back at 6 for two more points to spend.<br><br>Steve

I've noticed that in the whole history of D&amp;D, players have a tradition to mistreat CHA. Well I don't!<br><br>..and I intend to make a good use of all my characters abilities (like CoT's) . I like to have versatile characters instead of aiming to improve one aspect of their repertoire and avoiding everything else.

The vast majority of the builds on this forum tend to be powergaming type builds, so you have to expect some people to raise suggestions of that nature.  I'm all for building characters that are fun rather than uber (my Arcane Blade of Torm build would definitely fall into that category).<br><br>Steve

Where is this tradition?  Oh, you mean if i make a ftr/wm type build I should add stats to charisma, because otherwise it is mistreating the stat?  Im all for versatility, but your build isnt more versitile by havin 12 cha.  YOu are still ONLY a meleeist.  YOu cannot cast, use scrolls, cast or even use a bow/xbow to any appreciable degree, yet you can absorb 15 damage.  You have it at 12 so you gain +1  1 time per day...  WOW!  Thats versitile!<br><br>Just for your info, you should look at herbie's pal/cleric/cot if you want a versitile character <br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "186865", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>  With this character you can literally do anything!  Cast, range, melee, buff, open locks, disable traps!  Turn undead! Oh and you have an incredible set of saves!  OH, and it doesnt neglect the all imprtnt cha.<br><br>Peace<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 08/16/05 04:49</span></i></p>

I meant versatility as in general rule in my builds (not just with this one avado) and taking advantage of all your classes abilities is a wise choice in my book<br><br>and IMHO some CHA bonuses with this build could help with social skills, without needing to put cross-class skill points to them and also with CoT abilities (even though quite little, but still better than nothing at all)<br>_________________<br>"I like these calm little moments before the storm..."
