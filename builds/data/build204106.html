<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM</b><br><br>Here is a little build I made to try and redeem a dex-based Ranger primary.  Some people seem to think that this is not such a good idea, and they might be right, but I think that what follows might be a bit better than most (I hope, this is my first post after all).<br>Feel free to tell me how much this sucks.  My idea was to make a Ranger based build who can deal damage using traps, bow, kukris and his animal companion.  He can scout ahead as well as engage in melee.  His HP is a bit low, at least at the start, but it gets better quickyl towards the end.  I think that this character will do well in a low magic world.  Also, what his criticals can't accomplish his damage from Favored Enemies and Bane of Enemies can.<br>Please excuse the style of my post, since I use this in my plannings and it is easier for me to read, at least I think so. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   <br><br><br>Strategic Warrior<br><br>Human<br>Ranger 35, Shadowdancer 2, Bard 3<br><br>Abilities:<br>Starting:    Finishing:<br>STR  14      14<br>DEX  16      26<br>CON  10      10<br>WIS  14      14<br>INT  14      14<br>CHA  8       8<br><br><br>Skills:         Before Abilities:    After Abilities:<br>Discipline              42              44<br>Hide                    43              51<br>Move Silently           43              51<br>Perform                 10              9<br>Search                  42              44<br>Set Trap                42              50<br>Spellcraft              43              45<br>Tumble                  40              48<br><br>Spells:<br>Level:<br>1: Ultravision x 2, Resist Elements, Magic Fang<br>2: Cat's Grace, One with the Land, Protection from Elements x 2<br>3: Blade Thirst x 2, Greater Magic Fang<br>4: Polymorph Self, Freedom of Movement, Cure Serious Wounds<br><br>Feats: <br>Exotic Weapon Proficiency, Weapon Focus: Kukri, Improved Critical: Kukri, Toughness, Weapon Focus: Longbow, <br>Blind Fight, Dodge, Mobility, Weapon Finesse, Armor Skin, Epic Toughness I-VI, Bane of Enemies, Epic Weapon Focus: Kukri, Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow, Epic Will, Favored Enemy: {Undead, Elementals, Outsider, Dragon, Construct, Human*, Gnome*, Halfling*}<br><br>* These Enemies are not necessary, but nice since Humands are very common, and gnomes and halflings have bonuses to AC.<br><br>Weapon: Dual Kukris, Longbow<br>Armor: Padded Armor, Tower Shield<br>Equipment: Trap Kits<br><br>Naked AC: 10 + 8 Dex + 8 Tumble + 2 Armor Skin = 28<br><br>Max HP: 35 * d10 + 2 * d8 + 3 * d6 + 6 * 20 Epic Toughness + 40 Toughness = 350 + 16 + 18 + 100 + 60 = 544<br><br>Attack: 18 Pre-Epic + 10 Epic + 8 Dex + 1 Weapon Focus + 2 Epic Weapon Focus<br>= +39/+34/+29/+24 Longbow or Kukri &amp; Shield or<br>= +37/+32/+27/+22 Dual Kukri<br><br>Damage: 1d4 + 2 (15-20/x2) for Kukri, 1d8 (20/x3) for Longbow, +8 +2d6 versus Favoured Enemies<br><br>Saving Throws: <br>Fortitude: (10 Ranger + 0 Shadowdancer + 0 Bard) 10 Pre-Epic + 10 Epic + 0 Constitution = 20<br><br>Will: (5 Ranger + 0 Shadowdancer + 2 Bard) 7 Pre-Epic + 10 Epic + 4 Epic Will + 2 Wisdom = 23<br><br>Reflex: (5 Ranger + 3 Shadowdancer + 2 Bard) 10 Pre-Epic + 10 Epic + 8 Dexterity = 28<br><br>Advantages:<br>Can act as a scout, locating traps and hidden doors.<br>High spellcraft helps against spells.<br>High tumble allows for movement through combat.<br>Can disappear and reappear in the middle of combat, choosing strategic locations.<br>Uncanny Dodge preserves dexterity to AC.<br>High discipline prevents knockdown, called shot and disarm attempts.<br>Evasion allows him to avoid damage from reflex spells.<br>Bard Song, thrice a day, gives small bonus to attack, damage, will and fortitude saves.<br>Bonus to damage against Favored Enemies, particularly those immune to critical hits.<br>Veratility allows for both ranged and melee combat.<br>Trap setting allows for strategic crowd control.<br>Basic assortment of spells prevents problem with elemental attacks, magical darkness and entanglement spells.<br>Animal Companion, either Panther or Bear, to act as a secondary sneak attack and/or meat shield.<br>Spells can reinforce Animal Companion's attack and defense.<br>Spells also boost hiding and trapping skill, as well as weapon's ability to pierce damage reduction.<br>Invisible or concealed enemies have less of an advantage.<br>Spells allow for healing between battles, by changing into Troll (for regenerate) and using Cure Serious Wounds spell.<br><br><br>Disadvantages: <br>Low Saving Throws.

You've got a lot of Epic Toughness feats to get you some HPs, but you start with CON 10. I'd suggest, since damage is your real problem with this build (against non-favored enemies), that you start with 10 STR and 14 CON. Drop 4 of those Epic Toughness feats and take 4 more Favored Enemies. That will give you the same HP total and 12 FEs, which should cover darned near everything you'll encounter.<br><br>I'd also drop another Epic Toughness and pick up Epic Prowess to boost your AB a bit further.<br><br>One further thing: I'd seriously look at going with a different melee weapon and dropping the Exotic feat in favor of Knockdown. I know the build has no sneak attack, but your opponents can't hit you if they're flat on their ***.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Nice build and good concept.  Cin brought up some excellent points regarding the Epic Toughness thingy, which is really the most standout.  Definitely, definitely take FE's over these.  At most, I would take Epic Prowess in one of those FE slots, but not Epic Toughness.<br><br>Also, maybe I'm just not looking at it right, but I can't tell how or when he makes certain level-ups.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 07/15/05 12:46</span></i></p>

First of all thanks for examining my build.<br><br>to Cin: <br><br>I was thinking of going with handaxes, so I could use Blade thirst, but kukris are a little cooler and have a much more worthwhile crit range, so i went that route.  but definately taking knockdown is a good idea.  in fact, in the original build, i did have knockdown.  sorta forgot about it when i copied everything over. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br>I also didn't like dropping strength for constitution, and so i took a large number of epic toughness'.  I wanted to keep a decent HP by the end of the build to allow for better melee combat.  without all of those epic toughness' he has a max hp of just barely 400, i think, which is kinda low for a melee character without some sort of concealment ability/magic or natural damage reduction.<br>I do regret not getting in as many favored enemies as possible, but the list there is probably enough for most modules.<br>also, keep in mind that, for damage, he supplements this with positioning and trap setting (hence the strategic part <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  ).  Using traps and stealth to get into a favorable position, and then using arrows to lure the unsuspecting into those traps, then disappearing and doing it all over again.  I was hoping to create a character with good melee as well, so if the traps thing doesn't work, then sneaking around in combat and attacking from behind, hoping for a crit, isn't a bad idea.<br><br>To grizz:<br><br>Like I said, I think you both bring up good points.  I just wanted more HP.  That having been said, I think I could stand to lose a few to get more FEs.  Tru Epic prowess wouldn't hurt, but it also didn't seem to make that much of a difference towards the end.  Probably worth it though, come to think of it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br>As for the formatting of the post, all of the spaces that would have made for a nice presentation (and that took a really long time, might i add <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ) were removed, so i don't blame you for not being able to understand my gobblety gook.<br>basically, just look for a line with a number, that number being the character level.  anything on that line or below it, until the next level number, is what is gained for that level.<br>for example, at level 1, you increase Discipline, Search, Set Trap, Hide, Move Silently skills by 4 points, and you take the dodge, weapon finesse and favored enemy: undead feats.<br>then at level 2, you increase those same skills, but only by 1 skill point. (no feats)<br>I hope that helps.<br><br>I welcome any further help for this build, since I know that it lacks certain things. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>christian

Cool. I like the concept. One thing though: if you make the changes to your stats like I suggested, you won't lose any HPs at all in the build (unless you take Epic Prowess, in which case you lose 20 HPs). However, you do have less STR, so 2 less damage per hit and less carrying capacity. It really boils down to whatever you're most comfortable with, but I think the trade-off's more than worth it to get +1 AB and 4 more FEs (of course, you've a good point on the FEs in modules, but I was thinking more along the lines of PW play).<br><br>Cheers.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
