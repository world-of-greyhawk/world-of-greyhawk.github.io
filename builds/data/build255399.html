I like this bardie-builds. The only comment ont this one is that I would absolutly drop STR to 26 and raise INT and DEX to 14 for the skills and the extra reflex. Specially he skills. Only loose 1AB/DAM in this awsome offensive build almost doesnt affect him at all.

Totally agree, start 14 STR and DEX 14, INT 14 and drop one Great STR. You'll be able to max out Taunt too, get ESF: Perform to reach 50 perform on your own and drop a few points from it too to invest somewhere else. Or maybe get yourself AS, or ESF: Discipline or Taunt or  a save booster. There's a lot of choice.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?

Comment to the buff damage calculation. The +5 from GMW is enchantment damage and does apply after the multiplier if there is a critical hit.

I assume you're right Kail. I have to recalculate some builds then! Why is enc dam listed after the crit with the the elemental bunus damages in the character sheet I wonder??

Capital concept, calling this character the Calamitous Cantor, though Cantor conjures cleric to mind.  Curiously close to my clever creation's first concept, which changed because of feat consderations.  The chance for contusion is 2 more, by comparison. The absent concentration and still spell could cause cautious casting, but can't be called calamitous. At a cost of 1 STR, you could credit DEX and INT by 1, changing great strength for armor skin (lose 1 AB and damage for 2 AC, 43 skillpoints and +1 reflex save)  Crikey, I'll cease, lest my cranium crack from constant concentration.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

I'm sure about the elemental damage, in fact, because if you add a straight value (say, +10), I've seen that get multiplied on a crit (so suddenly you're doing 30 fire damage on crits, for instance).<br><br>The only things that don't get multiplied are the ones that never show up on your character sheet, like Darkfire and Flame Weapon.<br><br>Of course, I could be wrong.<br><br>*edit* @Mith, Thanks...heehee.
