The Outlaw’s Staff Master<br><br>Based on characters from the book: Robin Hood<br><br>This character is meant for PvM, for fun and to fit a sort of theme.  It is not terribly powerful, and quite simple with low saves.  By no means is it a PvP character…<br><br>Would like to see more builds based on Robin Hood themes, or even a different version of anyone’s ideas on how this guy could be portrayed, guess that’s why I post it.<br><br>Though he is a forester, I did not give him Ranger or Druid, this is because he does not draw magic from the woods, and it didn’t fit what I thought he was like.  He doesn’t take UMD either, same reason, he doesn’t know a thing about magic.  .<br><br>Human, Chaotic Neutral<br>Playable 1-40<br>12 Fighter, 25 Weapon Master, 3 Rogue<br><br>STR: 16 (26)<br>DEX: 14<br>CON 15 (22)<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8<br><br>01: Fighter(1): Dodge, Weapon Focus: Quarterstaff, Expertise<br>02: Fighter(2): Mobility<br>03: Fighter(3): Power Attack<br>04: Fighter(4): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Quarterstaff, (STR=17)<br>05: Fighter(5)<br>06: Fighter(6): Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack<br>07: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Quarterstaff<br>08: Weapon Master(2): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>09: Weapon Master(3): Improved Critical: Quarterstaff<br>10: Fighter(7)<br>11: Fighter(8): Cleave<br>12: Fighter(9): CON+1, Great Cleave, (CON=16)<br>13: Fighter(10): Disarm<br>14: Weapon Master(4)<br>15: Weapon Master(5): Improved Disarm<br>16: Weapon Master(6): CON+1, (CON=17)<br>17: Weapon Master(7)<br>18: Weapon Master(8): Knockdown<br>19: Weapon Master(9)<br>20: Weapon Master(10): CON+1, (CON=18)<br>21: Rogue(1): Great Constitution I, (CON=19)<br>22: Weapon Master(11)<br>23: Weapon Master(12)<br>24: Weapon Master(13): CON+1, Great Constitution II, Epic Weapon Focus: Quarterstaff, (CON=21)<br>25: Fighter(11)<br>26: Fighter(12): Epic Weapon Specialization: Quarterstaff<br>27: Weapon Master(14): Great Strength I, (STR=19)<br>28: Weapon Master(15): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>29: Weapon Master(16): Epic Damage Reduction I<br>30: Weapon Master(17): Great Strength II, (STR=21)<br>31: Weapon Master(18)<br>32: Weapon Master(19): STR+1, Epic Damage Reduction II, (STR=22)<br>33: Rogue(2): Great Strength III, {Evasion}, (STR=23)<br>34: Weapon Master(20)<br>35: Weapon Master(21)<br>36: Weapon Master(22): CON+1, Great Strength IV, Epic Damage Reduction III, (STR=24), (CON=22)<br>37: Weapon Master(23)<br>38: Weapon Master(24)<br>39: Rogue(3): Great Strength V, {Uncanny Dodge I}, (STR=25)<br>40: Weapon Master(25): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=26)<br><br>Hitpoints: 628<br>Skillpoints: 233<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 26/15/22<br>Saving Throw bonuses: <br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 48 (melee), 33 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 20/30<br><br><br>Craft Armor 41(43), Craft Weapon 41(43), Discipline 43(51), Heal 43(42), Intimidate 21(20), Tumble 40(42)<br><br>These skills can be changed, important stuff is Disc. and tumble, the rest is whatever you want.<br><br>Background:<br><br>	Staff fighting was a typical entertainment and many men were good at it in the story Robin Hood, if there was a challenge, it would often be settled by staff spar.  Woodsmen, monks, and others took pride in their ability to spar with the staff.  In the book, a good staff in the right hands would be known to crack skulls and shatter swords<br><br>This guys Story:  One man realized that his outlaw friends were mostly good with the bow.  Few had swords, these were rare around the camp but some did use them.  He had a mind for something heavier, and something he knew he would always have, wherever he could find a tree.  <br><br>	For a few hours a day he trained with the staff.  He took a few staff sparring challenges every day.  Before long, he was hardly ever beaten, and often challenged as he was a champion of sorts.  As a veteran, he was never beaten in a staff fight, not even close.  He trained others in staff fighting and set an example for a new style of fighting that the sherriff’s men would soon learn to fear.<br><br>	Surely fate would have better suited this natural, gifted warrior as a knight.  Maybe some plate armor, a shield and a sword, maybe a pike, or maybe even a greatsword.  However fate landed him in the outlaw camp from an early age, this was his life, and his element.  This man became a famous warrior defender of his encampment, passing down stories of merriment, and defending the outlaw’s life of freedom until the end of his days.<br><br><br><i>Added class split in the title, fixed AC - Kail Pendragon</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/04/06 06:18</span></i></p>

Very interesting build.  I'd probably take bard over rogue and push my taunt score as high as I could get it.  I can just picture this guy tossing out jibes to an armored knight as he pummels him all over a practice field.  All the while whistling a little tune that adds +1 to AB, +2 to damage and +1 to Fort &amp; Wil Saves.<br><br>BTW it looks like naked AC should be 20.  10 Base +2 Dex +8 Tumble.<br>_________________<br>In order to find his equal, an Irishman is forced to talk to<br>God.  Yes, Father.  The Almighty says don't change the subject; just<br>answer the &amp;%$#@&amp; question.

Yeah I really like your idea, makes good sense and fits him better than rogue.  Another thing about that, picturing him as a trainer and storyteller as well in his later levels.  He will also land more hits with that change.  <br><br>Not surprised the AC and other things are off, I just let the character planner calc that.
