A rare mystic, the Storm Elemntalist is a thoughtful and studied recluse who harnesses the swirling energies of Air and Water to fight the forces of chaos.

While all caster classes seem to have access to some of those spells, I found this combination to be most true to achieving a character who was truly a Storm Elementalist.  With Empowered Call Lightnings, Maximized Chain Lightnings, Silenced Firestorms, Maximized Ice Storms, and Storms of Vengenace, he can create a wide variety of havoc upon the battlefield.  Because these spells reside in the Evocation field, a happy side effect is having nice Hammer of the Gods and Implosion DCs in case the storm therapy doesn’t seem to work.  He enjoys a naturally high AC, much higher than he could in Full Plate and Shield, and is even able to use Deflect Arrow while in his casting mode.  He manages to control the battlefield with his Elemental summons, while engaging his enemy from afar with his elemental magicks.  His ranged AB is decent enough that he can still harangue his enemy with a Sling.  Decent hit points and good saves help to round the character out.<br><br>Kama was not chosen because it didn’t seem right for the character.  Quarterstaff made more sense from an elementalist point of view (actually warhammer was my preferred choice, but couldn’t squeeze it), and he’s not meant for melee anyway, though he could get down and dirty if required.  Silence spell was taken because it provides for more versatility than Extend Spell for a 29th level cleric.  This allows him to metamagic a variety of great spells at only one level higher.  <br><br>Hopefully, this character is varied enough from older cleric builds in the guild to qualify as a “fresh take without sucking.”  It was accidentally deleted from the Guild, but is reposted again for those looking for a fresh take on the Cleric class.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 03/21/09 17:42</span></i></p>

I'm doing HotU with this character atm =) Been looking for a solid and fun caster cleric build, all the other ones I've tried bugged me.<br><br>I'm going with magic instead of water for domain, both have ice storm and I'd rather the other spells from magic.
