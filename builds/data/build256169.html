Slashing, Raging, and Utilizing the Element of Surprise (1-40) PvM and PvP<br><br>GHOST WARRIOR (the “Braveheart”)<br>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar<br><br>*Author's Note: This character has been revised, with special thanks and acknowledgment to Kail Pendragon for his helpful advice and comments (revision notes, below)<br><br>Concept: This character, the Ghost Warrior, is inspired by Sir William Wallace (“Braveheart”), a knight and chieftain of Scotland, and one of her greatest patriots; his demand for justice inspired Scots to take-up revolution against medieval England, which charge he personally led. Miraculously, and against all odds, Braveheart and his forces were successful in battle, utilizing the element of surprise, and evading capture; he would show up to do battle, seemingly out of nowhere and, when the battle was done, he and his forces would disappear into the hills, like ghosts warriors, not to be seen or heard of by the English until it came time to do battle again. Eventually, however, Braveheart was betrayed by a soldier loyal to the English, who turned him in. Braveheart was subsequently tried and executed as a traitor, his head being displayed on a pike, and his limbs taken to Scotland as a warning. Whatever the intended effect, it had the opposite result: Braveheart’s death only served to further enrage the Scots who won their freedom, against the odds, and in memory of Braveheart, their uncrowned leader.<br><br>Character: This is the first of its kind, in terms of the class combination; with terrifying Barbarian Rage, almost 700 hitpoints (raging) and superior Weapon Mastery, Ghost Warrior is a solid melee tank. Mix in the Shadow Dancer’s element of surprise –and undeniable defensive power, which also makes the Ghost Warrior a very unique character.<br><br>Strengths &amp; Weaknesses: Ghost Warrior is a tank, but a playable one: with very high combat AB, Great Rage, and also having Uncanny Dodge and Evasion. This character has a decent skill set (incl. taunt, intimidate, tumble and stealth), can Hide-in-Plain-Sight, and even has good AC without the need of heavy full plate (nor any desire for it, since heavy armor would penalize his/her stealth/SD abilities (which have been maximized), and thus detract from the build); this warrior, however, is limited to melee-combat damage alone, which some may find frustrating. That said, with very good HPs, very high AB and the unique ability to spam HiPs, Ghost Warrior can go the distance, and makes for a balanced, enjoyable tank ~ Tyr<br><br><br>Ghost Warrior (the “Braveheart”) – Overview<br>Barbarian(16), Shadowdancer(2), Weapon Master(22)<br>Race: Human / Alignment: Any Non-Lawful (Theme: Chaotic Good)<br><br>I.

Start with STR 17, INT 14, CON 14 and change the INT increase to STR increase. Same ending stats, +40 HPs, +1 fort save, +30 skillpoints (if I calculated correctly).<br><br>Why SD 5? You can go SD 2 and WM 22. Defensive Roll is no big deal, really, and the shadow evade and shadow daze ain't worth it. Also, your will save sucks no matter Epic Will. I'd get Epic Reflexes instead to make that nice Evasion feat you have work. Use potions of clarity or fear/mind immunity gear to cover your will save. <br><br>Looks good. Pity you lack UMD.

Ditto to what Kail suggests. <br><br>Nice looking build all told really, very interesting take on a Barb. My only comments are the limited use of Terrifying Rage against similar/ higher level opponents. Personally I have found Thundering Rage to be more beneficial, due to the more frequent success of deafening your opponent, added to which you can avoid the skillpoint investment in Intimidate for something possibly more useful, possibly Discipline, which I don't see listed (have to say I am a little surprised at that). Doing that would also free up the ESF: Intimidate for another epic feat (epic Fort, Epic Reflex, Imp KD, etc).<br><br>Perhaps even go Dwarf, foregoing the need for Toughness, but you will have to sacrifice a skill. hmm...

Thanks, guys: <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">         <br><br>Indeed! (you knows it, I went for more SD for the def. roll and shadow stuff but,...just ran those numbers of yours, Kail, and, must say, when you puts it like that ...

As to skills (so hears you on UMD--not much we can do about that on this one (oh, if only, if only)..ah, but wait.. we can, w. these extras you found....hmmm, if we puts it with the left-overs (&amp; an oh so very gentle skim), ah, yes, there we go...40 disc. (YEAHH - thanks, Kail <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     <br><br>Hey, Samphus- and thanks (but no, no, losing skills bad; finding skills good <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">          Ah, but thundering, eh? Yeah, that extra damage on a crit isn't a bad thing to have at all (although, by then, we're sure to find some magic weapons)); nevertheless, and then again that shot at a deafening ain't too shabby-when it comes to dem casters &amp; eaves-dropping/listen types .. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">          <br><br>Gotta say though (and it could just be me), but there's something to be said about having a terrifying DC over 50 (keeping in mind my views re: insurance; if someone asks if they could get away w. less (as in swapping ESF: intimidate for thundering or something), then, yeah, the answer would probably be yes. But (yeah, I know, it's likely just me), I kinda feel good about so high a DC, especially since terrifying does wonders for mob control; really, though, your point is a good one, &amp; is appreciated (I mean it's not like we max'd out stealth and picked up HiPs or something, um, well, er .... OK, Samphus' point is def. something to consider, folks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>OK, ... back to the hills to adjust our new-and-improved ghost warrior, and I'll PM these exciting edits (thanks so much again; and, er, thinking, since it took a bit for you to wean me off that nasty habit I used to have, you know, character x version 1, version 2,.. version gazillion … er….  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">          <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">          <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">          (thanks so much again – I’ll get the changes out to you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 10/20/06 18:24</span></i></p>

Actually this build reminds me of something I built a long while ago, so long I almost forgot about it. I went Barbarian 16/Rogue 5/WM 19, ending on 32 STR, 48 AB, no sneaking skills and therefore no ESF: Hide/MS but UMD, trap setting skills, spellcraft, discipline, taunt, intimidate, tumble, 27 ref save with evasion and 3d6 SA. I think I have got a DEX varaiant too somewhere. Gotta check it out. <br><br>Personally I think that UMD alone is worth dropping SD. UMD gives you access to tons of scrolls which will make it much easier to cover your weaknesses and you get more skillpoints by starting off as Rogue. UMD and traps help a lot, trust me. I can PM you the build if you are interested.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/20/06 18:22</span></i></p>

Of course I base this off the film, but I thought ole Will Wallace had a bit of a leadership streak in him, and was able to inspire those around him to a higher level of warlike ferocity, and probably also capable of some Epic Taunting as he was able to successfully Taunt entire armies.  Perhaps something along the lines of Barb/Bard/CoT?  I think TR is a definite must, but I don't see SD as being an integral part of his background.  He was learned, educated, spoke various languages, and could rouse a people to fight.  If that ain't Bard, please guide my way.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Kail, yeah, that sounds very interesting, and I'd love to see it; please do PM me. When it comes to UMD, well, you drilled that into me pretty darn good, I must say (and I so thank you for it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   ); on this one, though, I went SD due to HiPs, not just for the theme per se, but b/c I wanted to create a good, solid melee'r with not just great rage and high AB (which we've got), but more so a str-based character w. good stealth, incl. the ability to weave in and out of battle (i.e., spam HiPs; I almost hate to admit it, but it's just so terribly fun and shamefully effective, and yet it's not something as a melee'r-type that I generally get to do). <br><br>I've another barbarian coming up, a 20th leveler w. mid-bard (UMD in tact, with lots of skills to play around with there, which I'm about to post, but no stealth or anything on him; a different kind of barbarian, and def. would love to see yours, too - (sounds awesome! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>edit -- Hey, GD -- <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  (hmmm, a bardic brbn you say; that be a tall order, lad, but I just might be able to fill it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  (btw, great film: changed a bit, but not that much actually - as to the hide, well, it was pretty integral to their strategy, t'was against the red coats ya know, but 'aye a bard does work  well, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 10/20/06 19:10</span></i></p>
