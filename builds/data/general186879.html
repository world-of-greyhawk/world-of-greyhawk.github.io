The closer I look at a lot of builds, it seems that they are pre-generated for lvl 40 only. I believe the 40th lvl cap class to round off the character plus getting +16BAB before lvl 20 to get 4 attacks per round. <br><br>So I was wondering if it is possible (in any way) to get a better idea of which builds can survive the long slow climb to 40. <br><br>Perhaps a contest of builds that are effective throughout their lifetime. Or possibly a forum for developable epic builds?<br><br>How does that sound?

That's pretty much impossible because it depends a lot on what items you can get - with no items at all fighter classes are pretty much screwed.<br><br>I have thought about making a thread with chars from 15 to 28 or something for HotU but the game is so easy already that I felt it was useless, LOL!

Open your mouth as wide as you like.

I think that some "epic char builds" are playable from lv 1 through 40.  <br><br>Classics like ftr rogue WM are consistiently strong (only really suffering during the first few pre epic WM levels), bard/rdd/ pale can be constiently strong, as can a lot of rdd builds.  Most rogue SD builds do very well as soon as they have HiPS and If you really can't stand "cheese builds" then ftr/cleric almost always delivers, especially if multiclassed with dwarven defender or CoT.  Shifters may have a hard time pre epic but once they get an epic shape shifting feat then they are very strong as well.

The Dwarven Wall is extremely strong for PvM play, right from the very start.  I played one up through the OC as my very first char, so I didn't really have that much idea what I was doing - and it was no trouble at all.  Less trouble than the builds I dreamt up myself afterwards, anyway <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br>Not sure I'd agree with all the skills suggested but the key aspects of the build are spot on.

I find the majority of monk builds are fairly playable as long as you get average sorta items<br><br>-DaMouse

Dude, I am hurt!  You didnt include my shifter (3 shpe shiftr)!  Check the list for link.  The hardest part of a shifter build are pre-epic!  I sorta got around that by focusing on melee for the first 20 lvls or so.  The shifter has decent ab (4 attacks at lv 20, with longsword or scythe), then after lv 20 it starts to get fun.   <br><br>I guess im not part of the elite around here so it gets missed!

I made the cut!!! Woohoo!!!<br><br>Avado: Put your links here. That is what I started this thread for. So folks can come to a single place to find a playable build.<br><br>And hopefully it "may" become official/stickied once enough of them are here. Maybe a playable index? Who knows...

I posted a triple WM a few weeks back called the "Adaptable Weapon Master" which I think is strong from lv 1 up to lv 40.

A number of the Epic Character Builds posted are also quite playable from level 1.  I've personally played the <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_roguearcher.html" target="_blank">Rogue Archer</a> and the <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_divinewarrior.html" target="_blank">Divine Warrior</a> from level 1 with no problems.  The <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_exaltedsorceress.html" target="_blank">Exalted Sorceress</a> would also be playable from level 1.<br><br>Steve

Most melee builds and caster/melee hybrid involving the Cleric are good from 1 to 40.

In fact, some of them are not really "playable" at all.  The Undead Lord for example was a good build at the time, but since the last few patches, it's weakened quite a bit (It was designed as a mage killer, but isn't really that effective anymore considering the way Dispels work with the latest patchs, although it would still be alright in a low magic world).  The Troubadour Guardian is not that great, and it requires no less than 8 alignment shifts the way it was posted.  The Combat Medic is basically built <b>not</b> to survive outside of a party, especially early on.  The Dragon Savant is not exactly that great from the start, and the Dragon Kin would have some issues in the early teens.  And aside from the actual strengths of the build, a lot of them have XP penalties for large portions of their existence: Blade Juggernaut from level 5 until level 39 for example.  I would hardly say that all the epic builds are really playable from level 1 to 40.  A few aren't even that great at level 40.  And even if most of them are alright, there are still some that quite a bit more evenly strong throughout than others, and thus worth mentioning.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 04/18/05 10:46</span></i></p>
