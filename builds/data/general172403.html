I would like suggestions on how to build a monk/Rogue build for a PW that has a level 30 limit.  Must be human, dual wield (Kama is fine) and dex based.  Epic dodge and any self concealment would be great at higher levels.  Was hoping to be rogue-oriented.  Maybe somewhere around a 21 Rogue / 9 monk... something like that?<br><br>Any help on the level process to maximize feats, attacks, AB would be very helpful.<br><br>Many thanks!

It will be difficult to get any form of SC since most builds only get 30 dex in thier 30s so im afraid you will only have epic dodge. You will need 10 Rogue minimum Id suggest this. DEX start at 18<br><br>Level 20 Monk 12 / Rogue 8 DEX =23<br>Level 21 Rogue Feat<br>Level 22 Monk <br>Level 23 Monk <br>Level 24 Monk DEX =24 Feat <br>Level 25 Monk<br>Level 26 Monk<br>Level 27 Monk Feat<br>Level 28 Monk DEX =25<br>Level 29 Rogue Defensive Roll Max UMD and other rogue skills as appropriate<br>Level 30 Monk <br><br>Id recommend one feat for great dex 1 for dex =26. Another alternative would be start with dex =16 and take a few feats later of great dex (level 21 , level 24 , level 27) for more balanced stats. However you would lose out on a lot of feats.<br><br>Syrath
