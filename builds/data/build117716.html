ok this is my first time posting but here it goes.<br><br>This build is meant to be one of the ultimate duelers i would not try and take this guy through the game.<br><br>Fighter 6/ Cleric 4/ Champion of Torm 30<br><br>Starting Stats:<br><br>Strength 15<br>Dexterity 13<br>Constitution 14<br>Intelligence 9<br>Wisdom 8<br>Charisma 16<br><br>Skills:<br>Max disipline and parry for counterattacks<br><br>Put all stat points into charisma<br><br>Figh= fighter<br>Cler= cleric<br>Cot= Champion of Torm<br><br>Levels and Feats:<br><br>1 figh- luck of heroes, strong soul, weapon focus<br>2 figh- power attack<br>3 figh- toughness<br>4 figh- weapon specialization<br>5 cler- domains(war and strength)<br>6 cler- divine might<br>7 figh<br>8 figh- blind fighting<br>9 cot- lightning relfexes<br>10 cot- improved critical<br>11 cot<br>12 cot- great fortitude, dodge<br>13 cot<br>14 cot- cleave<br>15 cler- divine shield<br>16 cot<br>17 cot- mobility<br>18 cot- resist energy<br>19 cot<br>20 figh<br>21 cot- epic reflezes<br>22 cot<br>23 cot<br>24 cot- great charisma I, epic weapon focus<br>25 cot<br>26 cot<br>27 cot- epic skill focus(discipline)<br>28 cot- epic wheapon specialization<br>29 cot<br>30 cot- epic prowess<br>31 cot<br>32 cot- armor skin<br>33 cot- great charisma II<br>34 cot<br>35 cot<br>36 cot- epic toughness I, great charisma III<br>37 cot<br>38 cot<br>39 cot- great charisma IV<br>40 cot- epic toughness II<br><br>Ending Stats:<br><br>Strength 15<br>Dexterity 13<br>Constitution 14<br>Intelligence 9<br>Wisdom 8<br>Charisma 29<br><br>This build works great when the person your dueling is immune to critcal hits. With divine wrath from cot your attack bonus and saves go up turmendously.<br><br>Unbuffed(naked except for weapon):<br>attack bonus 35/30/25/20<br>fort: 46<br>reflex: 43<br>will: 34<br><br>After casting divine might, wrath, strength and war domain powers(naked except for weapon):<br><br>attack bonus 51/46/41/36<br>fort: 60<br>reflex: 57<br>will: 47<br><br>Plus the extra dmg from divine might and wrath give you an additional 20 dmg in divine energy. Since most people dont have resistance to divine energy they would get hurt pretty bad. Most spells you can save against except for isaacs so i would suggest getting something with magic resist on it. As far as items go get some with good ac. Youll want one item that adds to your strength and another which adds to your charisma. I wouldn't pick on someone if you dont have immune to critical either it could really hurt. Remember divine shield will add 10 to your ac when naked also.<br><br>Please comment on my build and tell me what you think.<br><br>One question: what does it mean when you roll an initative roll?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 17:17</span></i></p>
