There's no doubt it's a strong caster, but I'm always skeptic about Harper Scout really helping a build. I've done a few builds with HS and some weird stuff has come out, but I can't find how it strengthens this build.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

HS was just a way to fit in a ESF as well as Grt Int X, 3 Epic Spell Focuses and Epic Warding.<br><br>You could of course switch out HS/Alertness/Iron Will for Dodge/Mobility/SD just switch your attributes around a bit.<br><br>Either way, I liked being able to have 3 Epic focuses/Grt Int X/Epic Warding and still fit in a Epic Skill Focus without really losing anything.

Take Ranger pre-epic (will bump lvl 20 Wizard bonus feat into epic; take Greater Spell Focus with Ranger FE), and switch Harper Scout for Monk.  You'll lose the HS bonus feat, but will get Evasion and can buff WIS to get some extra AC.  Even better,if you were to use a little Melee Mage tactics with this build, you could dual-wield kamas w/ Flurry-of-Blows for 6 attacks, 7 hasted (!!) or 6 unarmed attacks w/ Flurry &amp; Haste.  Icing on the cake if you Melee Mage like this: you get Cleave for free, too.<br><br>Making those changes will loose you Epic Skill Focus (Discipline), but gain Evasion, Cleave, Improved Unarmed Strike, ability to use Monk robes/boots/gloves, and two extra main-hand attacks + option to Flurry when using kamas or unarmed.  Essentially a Melee Mage that gets A LOT of mileage against the mobs with Flame Weapon + Keen Weapon + etc. kamas, and then can nuke the BBEG with 45DC spells vs. whatever its low save appears to be.<br><br>Incidentally, I don't find any Wizard/Ranger/Monk combos using pulse cap's search engine, so maybe it's never been included on this board.  I've had this guy (without the tri-focus, and not a Dwarf; bravo on the tri-focus) sitting in a spreadsheet for more than a year, never play-tested.<br><br>On Edit: dropping Harper Scout will also allow you to switch Alertness and Iron Will for Extend Spell and Toughness.<br><br>On edit again:  If you don't care about maxing Discipline, Tumble and Listen, then take the Monk level pre-epic, too.  Level 17 would be the obvious candidate (though taking it earlier would only make getting Tumble 20 more expensive as Wizards can attain it by level 37 paying double, so the Monk tumble pre-epic is really just a discount).  Doing so would make the build more playable early on, and would net you +2 to all saves.  Moving Ranger pre-epic already gave you +2 Fort and -1 Will.  This will cost you 20 points to Discipline, Tumble and Listen, maybe Persuade, too.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Betty Black on 03/18/09 06:45</span></i></p>
