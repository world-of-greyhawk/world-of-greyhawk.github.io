I see this build has been done to death, I want to add my version. Everybody says that cleric/rogue are very powerful and I wanted to test what I could take out of them).<br><br>For added cheese I did put a single monk level in the build in order to get wisdom AC bonus (It has been so hard to avoid the temptation of a dual kama wielder...).<br><br>This is a fairly explosive build, he is not really good when he is unbuffed but he can become awesome once he self buffs himself he can reach<br>49 AC with plain clothes (self buffed and dualwielding)<br>58 AB with mundane dual daggers and 1d4 +28 +1d6 +[12d6] damage per hit with 3(4 if hasted) attacks per round at full BAB.<br><br>He also has epic dodge and can cast improved invisibility (50% concealment) and can reach really good AC.<br><br>He can cast anything from scrolls (I recommend finding premonition, summon spells, keen edge, flame weapon, mage armor, cat's grace as a basic set).<br><br>He can summon, use darkness, hammer of the gods... to land his 12d6 sneak attacks (with crippling strike) on his victim.<br><br>Some of his buffs wont last long, but with the right planning he can take down almost anything in matter of seconds.<br><br>Tactics:<br><br>This one is the most effective against non-true vision enemies:<br>Use your long term buffs on you, set up a "battlefield" with area spells (Darkness + blade barriers + creeping doom), cast your short term buffs and lure your victims to the darkness.<br><br>Use a summon.

On the fly, I'd say drop starting STR to 10, raise WIS to 16 (for a final stat of 19)take only 19 lvl Rogue and 20 Cleric. You lose 2d6 sneaks and some skill points (but you're gonna have a lot anyhow) but get higher boni from the domain powers, longer lasting buffs, 9th lvl spells.<br>If you feel you can do without crippling strike take only 16 lvls Rogue and push Cleric to 23. You lose 1 Rogue bonus feat but get 1 cleric bonus feat..I'd suggest Great Wisdom to end with 20 WIS (another +1 to AC among the rest)<br><br>Cheers<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Could drop str to 10, raise int to 12, and pump more skills if you don't want to drop rogue and increase cleric levels.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
