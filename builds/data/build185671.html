Looks intresting, but a lot of servers support improved item merging...so it might be nice to push wisdom up naturally and get outsider shape as well for the lovely rak form spell immunity.  I really like the inclusion of blackguard for the 4/round and sneak damage which stacks with the 5d6 on the epic kobolds shortsword though.

Interesting point about improved item merging as I didnt know that existed for some servers <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br>I guess the main benefit with the Raakshaa is that it can avoid nasty situations around missile storm.<br>Against most spells the saves are really good and both the Drow/Kobold get improved evasion, also SR 30 can help with some fights.<br><br>I decided to focus on charisma for the saves, ac bonus, and dmg enhancement.<br>I agree that one day I will probably wished I had taken Outsider <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Edit:<br>Ooh I forgot to mention that Charisma helps with using Taunt to lower the AC of monsters and this can be important for shifters as their attacks are not the best.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By lala_truthsayer on 03/16/05 23:22</span></i></p>

Ya you will definately wish that if you are going to use this character on a pvp environemnt, otherwise you won't miss it all that much most likely. A nice use of the shifter concept though. Do you feel the weapon focus feats are al that needed? Seems like a lot of feat use to get only a few more AB.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Yeah there are a lot of weapon focus feats, but from my own experience they do make a difference at epic levels.<br>I tend to go for the benchmark (naked) that a melee build needs to be about +44ish, while a melee caster or enhanced feature melee build need to be about +38ish.<br>I guess it depends on the difficulty of the persistent world, but those figures work out about right for me.<br><br>The problem with most of the shifter shapes (excluding Dragon)is that their abilities scores are not that impressive, while the shifter enhanced weapons distort the attack values.<br>So the Epic Drow in this case is; BAB 26, WF/EWF/EP 4, Str 6 gives a total attack bonus of 36 naked. <br>Adding the +6 sword does make it 42, however this shows that the figure is pretty low.<br>Remove the 4 attack bonus for WF/EWF/EP and the mundane attack level drops to 32.<br><br>I would say that figure is too low at epic levels for most moderate tough persistent worlds.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By lala_truthsayer on 03/17/05 16:22</span></i></p>

My friend, I like the concept!  (*cough* reminds me of my dru/shf/COT build!)   We should really get your guy and mine together to knock around cw.  It would be quite entertaining.<br><br>I do second the use of wpn and epc wpn focus in the shifter builds.  If you dont use them, why specialize at all? Make a dru/shifter pure build and use dragon form.  What would be fun is to try to work in wf/ewf in unarmed!  LOL  too many feats?  Oh well (jkin)<br><br>Peace

Interesting build...nice job. One question I have is how, if you focus on the Undead form, do you actually heal your character while shifted. I have always enjoyed the undead form but find it to a niche form, thus would support taking construct or outsider as well...

One thing people will tell you is to have your wizzy cast Neg Energy Burst to heal you and raise your STR at the same time, or your Cleric to cast Harm or Inflict Wounds on you, but that is not always a possibility, esp if you are racking around town solo.<br><br>I am currently trying to coax my DM into either making Potions of Harm as monster drops or merchant sells, or to just make Potions of Heal heal your undead form with a script fix like it does nonundead, erm...living.  You cannot use the potions on enemy undead anyway, so changing the script would maybe be a less cluttersome option.

Thanks...that answers my questions. Harm potions, eh? I'd thought of those in the past -- might be a good idea to revisit.
