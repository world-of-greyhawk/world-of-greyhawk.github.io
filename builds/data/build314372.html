I was slightly wrong I think. With the first build you get 1 more save point in total. However, the buffed saves with no gear of the second build are better.<br>_________________<br>I'm a poor man your honour. I come before you full of remorse and malnutrition.

Ahh I see. That's pretty funny. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>I tend to look at it more like say, a Jedi tempted by the darkside, becomes a Dark Jedi or Sith for a bit and then possibly sees the light again so to speak.<br><br>As for this particular build, it was really just a challenge to see if I <i>could</i> get higher saves (just for ECB posterity), so it may as well be considered born at 40 and not for playing.<br><br>Other than that, a Monk/Paladin/Blackguard can actually be pretty tough, as with most Paladin/Blackguard/Something combos. It's up to the player to decide if it's worth it to them to do the switching (provided the module/server allows it), and if they want it for RP reasons or they just love the exploit, or (like me) they like both.<br><br>Some players might just play these kinds of builds as born at 40 in an SP campaign or module, which will in most cases result in a one-sided masochistic pounding (ahh good fun <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> ).<br><br>But then you already know all of this. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>-"You did sing at my concert, but your performance just now was even worse!"<br>-"I've been practicing."

The way I see it the RP of this build is that of the fallen paladin attaining redemption. There are a hell of a lot of ways to fall temporarily, i.e. practical jokes, betraying an evil merchant, etc.

Yes due to the stacking issues that are capped in the game, but to even think with out the cap that it would be possible is still insane.<br>_________________<br>I'm both a master of my inner self, and of my outward form.<br>-Xovia Dar'Kain<br>6Monk/9Druid/25Shifter<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Creatures.Detail&amp;id=594" target="_blank">My base Module</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Xovian on 01/27/10 18:42</span></i></p>

Actually when saves get this high it is really not the best.  Feats like evasion, improved evasion, and slippery mind (all of which this builds lacks) can make quite lower saves much more effective.  Once its down to the only failure being the 1/20 autofail, boosting saves is meaningless.  Another factor which this build is lacking (to help against saves) is immunities.  Sure its immune to fear and disease, but it didn't take enough paladin levels to cast death ward for death magic (technically this is spell immunity from the spell resistance check and immunity to the default command EffectDeath(), but not saving throw).
