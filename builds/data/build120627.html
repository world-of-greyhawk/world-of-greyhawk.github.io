This other idea of mine was inspired by Teons Kobold Commander Shifter. In my PW its Good VS Evil, I hate playing good so I present you with....(This design also built with the thought of natural leveling, once you hit lvl 16 things get alot easier)<br><br>*Insert Paladin Type doo gooder*<br>*There you are standing there with your silly holy sword and shield, thinking about how good your hair looks. Talking with a fair maiden, trying to win her heart. You turn to discuss the sunset and attempt a kiss,and then.. Then you hear an aweful sound...* "Grazba gra gra!!!" *You turn your head just as a disgusting Kobold appears out of thin air and hits you...Once* *You thought she was a lady.....*<br><br>Race Whatever <br>Neutral Evil<br><br>Kiss of Death<br>Starting Stats(STR/CON depend on race and your preference)<br>STR Variable<br>DEX 8<br>CON Variable<br>INT 8<br>WIS 11<br>CHA 18 +7<br><br>1 Druid - Alertness<br>2 Druid<br>3 Druid - Power Attack<br>4 Druid<br>5 Druid <br>6 Shifter - Cleave<br>7 Shifter - (Hide 5 Ranks)<br>8 Blackguard <br>9 BG - Weapon Focus - Shortsword<br>10 BG<br>11 BG<br>12 Shifter - Increased Critical - Shortsword<br>13 Shifter<br>14 Shifter<br>15 Shifter - Feat of Choice<br>16 Shifter - Human Shape(Kobold Commando)<br>17 BG - <br>18 BG - Extra Smiting<br>19 BG - <br>20 BG - <br>21 BG - Great Charisma I<br>22 BG - <br>23 BG - <br>24 BG - Great Smiting I<br>25 BG - Great Smiting II<br>26 BG<br>27 BG - Great Smiting III<br>28 BG - Great Smiting IV<br>29 BG - <br>30 BG - Great Smiting V<br>31 BG - Great Smiting VI<br>32 BG - <br>33 BG - Great Smiting VII<br>34 BG - Great Smiting VIII<br>35 BG - <br>36 BG - Great Smiting IX<br>37 BG - Great Smiting X<br>38 BG - <br>39 BG - Epic Wpn Focus Shortsword<br>40 BG - Feat of Choice<br><br>Pros<br>Can Smite Good very well.

Quote: Posted 04/05/04 17:20:57 (GMT) by Herbie Shimmer<br><br>    *snip*<br><br>    Great build Hediyoshi, i like the concept too. The only thing I'd be worried about would be the amount of general damage done, ie against non good creatures. Could you consider dropping some Great Smiting feats in exchange for Great Strength or something?<br><br>    If you put Con to 10 you could have 15 Strength and put the left over stat point from levelling into it. Then with Great Strength 1&amp;2 you could raise it to 18. Still not great, but perhaps better than relying on sneaks to deliver damage. Just a thought, anyhow.<br><br><br>Thanks for responding, I definatly see your point as far as general damage goes. With only 4 attacks it would take a pretty substantial set of STR gear to get the damage to be sub par. With those thoughts in mind. To get 25 Charisma and Greater Smite X and still be able to hit something at all is an accomplishment.<br><br>This build is by no means a one man army, but given the right situation Roleplay wise it would be quite interesting. Talks and rumors of a Fair lady(25cha she looks better than Monica Bellucci, ok no one looks better than her but) a fair lady suddenly shapeshifting to unleash a Kiss of Death to potential wooers. Sure would stir up the town. Kinda like that witch in Conan the Barbarian, I still have nightmares

I really like this build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>bilb: you could allways ditch ALL the smiting feats, and replace them with divine might, divine shield, greater STR and improved sneak attack<br><br>i tried it out, you can do pretty good damage
