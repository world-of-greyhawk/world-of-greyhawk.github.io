If limited to the basic game and no Prestiege classes I'd go for Bard, Ranger and Druid. Basically I like versitile characters rather than specialists. Rogue is also very versitile but easy to tag on to any build so I don't often consider it as a main class.<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

Avado is right. I think you would get much more feedback if you ask "What's your most hated class?" and then get the less hated *giggles*.<br><br>I think most would say Harper Scout (poor harpers), so the question should be "What's your most hated class besides harpers?" <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> .<br><br>About not getting feedback on a build, yes, it is really frustrating... "Did they like it? Didnt they?", "Is it so perfect that there is nobody to comment? Or is it so bad that it doesnt deserve a comment?".<br>_________________<br>HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh.

The question would probably have got more answers in NWN General Discussion. Not getting any comments on a build is annoying but I suppose at least it means there are no horrendous flaws in your build since those do tend to get commented on.<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

I personally think it is becasue the "great days" of building are mostly over.  All the "interesting" builds are done.<br><br>1.66 caused a brief flurry, but that has died down.<br><br>Only the PRC is really offering more material for builds, and most of the "great builders" of yore don't seem all too keen on creating builds based on PRC, apparently.<br><br>So that leaves us, to step into their footsteps, and start putting out builds.<br><br>When I look in the PRC builds section, it is so skimpy, it isn't funny!  Perhaps a fraction of the material has been touched.<br><br>And now that Psionic classes are being released, along with spellbooks (which, btw, do allow the PrC in question to be considered an Arcane or Divine caster, the possibilites are...stunning.<br><br>Then add in the Races... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">

Thats what we should do then. If the "masters" are tired of making new builds because they believe that they have made them all, then we should each come up with something worthy of respect. I am leaving to go to Minnesota tomorrow. Thats a one and half day drive, I believe, from where I am. So, instead of twiddling my thumbs and Singing, "On the Road Again", I'll come up with a unique build. Wish me luck, I think I might need a ton of it.<br><br>*sets of on a new adventure in search of glory*

I dunno if all the builds have been touched on. I have seen a bunch of builds that are strangely good on the server I play on and have searched for somehting like them here and not found them. Granted they are total power builds but still. Like Bard 23/Paladin 7/Pm 10, or Paladin 23/bard 7/pm 10 that build is pretty unstoppable from what i've seen. And I always wondered how the two people that did it came up with it and how they did it, but haven't foudn anything. Someone did this great MOnk/druid/cot build with Dragon shape, it was soemthign liek 20monk/10 druid/10 cot or something, good saves, adn gets all the immunities of monks.<br><br>As for me my favorite class woudl be Paladin. Then maybe CoT. I don't think Harpers are as bad as you think they are, I Mean They can really help with saves. And on a server with a lot of death magic, elemental magic, and Dev crit, Saves are great. I have a Paladin with 50+ fort save 45+ will and reflex, and no save items, just +12 to charisma. He basically passes all saves unless he rols a one. Also good versus those pesky traps that do liek 300 dmg -_-.<br>_________________<br>~I am the wisest man on earth because I know one thing, and that is I know nothing.~<br>-Cairne

Blackguard has always been my favorite class.<br>It is pure love for the name, the idea of the class, the roleplay behind it and what it can bring of respect being a POWERFUL! blackguard. The last part is the downside....No build becomes more powerful by taking Blackguard and that sucks. I still love them.<br>_________________<br>Be realistic...

I'm partial to Rogues, Bards and (yes, I'm serious) Harper Scouts. The HS can bring a <b>lot</b> to a build in only 5 levels. Not a bad investment. The 2 feats needed as prereqs aren't the greatest, although I often take Iron Will in my builds anyway, and the skill point investment can be a bit dicey if you have to cross class a lot of them. However, it's still a great support class in many builds. I also like some FTR levels in my builds, if at all feasible.<br><br>Someone mentioned a lack of builds posted similar to what was on the server they play (PM/Bard/Pally, for example). I'd say the reason you don't see many builds like that is because of the alignment shift required. Not many environments offer the ability to shift alignment at will, so that's why many people don't bother posting builds that require it. (I've thought up a few builds that need to shift alignment - I <i>love</i> the thought of a Pally/Bard combo - but I don't bother posting them because I personally feel that shifting alignment is somewhat... cheesy).<br><br>As to new builds by the 'masters', I think all the basic build combinations have been done. Basically what's cropping up now are curiosity builds, builds that utilize generally overlooked classes, builds that tweak some of the basic templates to be better at one specific function over another, and skill-reliant builds. Although, I've seen a trend towards builds that don't rely on Dev Crit (I tend not to build with Dev Crit as a goal - not that I'm a 'master' by any stretch of the imagination), which is refreshing.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
