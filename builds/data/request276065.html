I play on TLJ (The Last Jedi) roleplaying server ... yea. Well anyways, I was wanting a build that had really nice will saves (Some of the highest will I've seen on the server is like ... 90 so yea ...) but really really good at PvP and PvM. The server is supposed to get nerfed, which would mean it would be -alot- better for a caster to come along, but until then, stuff like harm 'n' the like -sucks- due to negative immunity percentages 'n' the like ... Anyone have an idea? Most used are atleast some levels of monk, so if one could straggle from such a thing for uniqueness, that would be a plus, and also there are no prestige limits, so prestiges are alright!

Crazy saves huh? that one sure works at saves. If it's only Will save you might want Cleric or Druid with lots of WIS, probably with Monk and CoT <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    but probably nothing compares to the CHA based Paladin X / Blackguard X / CoT 30 after all, not too bad when you activate Divine Wrath, but other than that it might not be a really good PvP build.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 06/11/07 18:49</span></i></p>

Mages are generally good for the technical side of resisting spells and DC spells because of protection from alignment, mindblank, clarity, spell mantle etc etc etc...<br><br>If these are scripted will saves you have to save against than I'm afraid nothing short of the actual will can help, in which case the paladin/bg/cot gets the best of.

Why try to make a Will save when you don't have to?<br><br>A Shifter has forms that are immune to Mind affecting Spells.<br><br>Mind Flayer, Undead Shapes, Construct Shapes.<br><br>Druids have their Elemental Shapes that are immune as well.<br><br>Level 7 Palemaster gets immunity to Stun, Hold Monster/Person and Paralyzation. <br><br>====<br><br>What type of effect are you trying to protect yourself from?

I don't know if the OP is still around, but here is a build that might fit nicely into the Sith Lord type of roll.  Starting good and falling into evil ... you know, the typical cliche. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I tried to build it as a spellsword (heavy on spell), using Paladin and Blackguard to boost saves, as per your request. They aren't as good as the aforementioned Pal/COT/BG, but if you are prepared, your Sorc buffs will handle quite a bit things that are thrown at you even before you require a save.<br><br>If you could do with weaker saves, I would consider dropping the paladin for 4 levels of RDD or perhaps Bard for Tumble and Bard Song. <br><br>Anyway, I played a variant (Fighter-Cleric-Sorc) through the Lords of Darkness mod, and it performed pretty well.  You might consider Longsword and shield for extra AC.  It should work fine for PvM, but you will end up falling back on Spells for PvP (Timestop, IGMS, etc.). Of course, I don't PvP often, so take it with a grain of salt.<br><br>Oh, and this is a bit of a pain to level until around 10 or so. Also, I just built this on paper, so I'm not sure eveything is correct.<br><br>STR 16<br>DEX 10<br>CON 14<br>WIS 8<br>INT 10<br>CHA 16 (32)<br><br>1 Sorc 1 - Knockdown, Still Spell<br>2 Paladin 1<br>3 Sorc 2 - Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>4 Sorc 3 - CHA 17<br>5 Sorc 4<br>6 Sorc 5 - Power Attack<br>7 Sorc 6<br>8 Sorc 7 - CHA 18<br>9 Sorc 8 - Cleave<br>10 Sorc 9<br>11 Sorc 10<br>12 Sorc 11 - Empower Spell (or Improved Critical), CHA 19<br>13 BlackGuard 1<br>14 Blackguard 2<br>15 Blackguard 3 - Divine Might<br>16 Sorc 12 - CHA 20<br>17 Sorc 13<br>18 Blackguard 4 - Divine Shield<br>19 Sorc 14<br>20 Blackguard 5 - CHA 21<br><br>21 Sorc 15 - Epic Prowess<br>22 Sorc 16<br>23 Sorc 17<br>24 Sorc 18 - Epic Weapon Focus: GS, CHA 22<br>25 Sorc 19<br>26 Sorc 20<br>27 Sorc 21 - Great Charisma I<br>28 Sorc 22 - CHA 24<br>29 Sorc 23 - AutoStill I*<br>30 Sorc 24 - Great Charisma III<br>31 Sorc 25<br>32 Sorc 26 - AutoStill II*, CHA 26<br>33 Sorc 27 - Great Charisma IV<br>34 Sorc 28<br>35 Sorc 29 - Auto Still III*<br>36 Sorc 30 - Great Charisma V, CHA 29<br>37 Sorc 31<br>38 Sorc 32 - Great Charisma VI*<br>39 Sorc 33 - Great Charisma VII<br>40 Sorc 34 - CHA 32<br><br>AB 30 - [BAB 23 + STR 3 + WF 1 + EWF 2 + EP 1]<br>AC 18 - [Base 10 + Plate 8]<br><br>buffed<br>AB 40 - [30 + GMW 5 + Emp Bulls 3 +  BG-Bulls 2]<br>AC 43 - [18 + Cats 1 + Mage Armor 3 + Shield 3 + Haste 4 + DS (buffed) 14]<br><br>Saves (+ 8 versus spells)<br>Fort 44 - [preepic 10 + epic 10 + Con 2 + Paladin 11 + BG 11]<br>Will 41 - [preepic 10 + epic 10 - Will 1 + Paladin 11 + BG 11]<br>Reflex 35 - [preepic 5 + epic 10 + Paladin 11 + BG 11]<br><br>Cheers.
