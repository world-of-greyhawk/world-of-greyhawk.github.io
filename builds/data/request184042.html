Hello eveyone,<br><br>I play on a Med - High magic PW with a few rules that need to be stuck to when making a character.  <br><br> Is there anyone that can build, or knows of a build, that is a mage killer with a decent ac and ab? Monk comes to mind with the SR that is availible, but what to cross it with? monk/fighter/rogue? monk/something/SD?<br><br> My best friend in the PW is a nasty Sorc/rdd/fighter build and I would love to, just once even, clean his clock for him <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br><br>Now, here are the guide lines of PC's on my server:<br>**The server I am on does not allow banking of skill points. <br>**The shadow dancer class needs 5 lvl's in a row to be taken.<br>**There is no Dev Crit. <br>**PM to 9th level only<br>**Limit to One Prestige Class<br>**Halflings(if we go that route) need to be good or neutral without being casters.<br><br>So....Can anyone think of anything?<br><br>Thanks alot in advance for the help!

Myself I might actually go either monk35/sd5 [tho casters will have the truesight on at all times in pvp] OR monk10[speed]]/cleric30.<br>Take monk8/cleric12 before epic<br>Take all the spell penetration feats; and maximise+extend<br>Cleric spell SpellResistance at lvl30 will give you SR of 42; though it can be dispelled by a higher class of wiz; you could store it in quickened form and recast it while saving another full move for the round.<br>Be a dwarf; added spell saves iirc<br>Use Harm on them FIRST before they get any spells off, this reduces them to 1d4 hitpoints.. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Ok; normal warning apply, I'm not good at the building stuff but this is kinda the route I would go if you were stuck on monkyness.

Hi there!<br><br> Yeah, I was thinking the 35 Monk / 5 SD myself and went ahead and started it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br> So far I am at level 12 Monk. Her stat's at lvl 12 are:<br><br>Human Monk<br>LE<br>STR 14<br>DEX 19<br>CON 10<br>INT 14<br>WIS 14<br>CHA 08<br>Saves:<br>Fort 8<br>Reflex 12<br>Will 10<br>Base Attack 9<br>Spell Resistance 22 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif">  <br><br>The feats she has, besides the feats that come automaticly with the Monk Class are:<br>AmbiDex, Dodge, Mobility, Two Weap. Fighting, Weapon Finesse, and Weapon Focus.<br><br>Her skills are mainly in disipline, tumble, hide, and MS with 10 heal and 10 concentration as well.<br><br> So far i am having lots of fun playing her. She's not very powerful but boy can she run!! lol.<br><br> But now i have some other questions.  In order for me to get the most attacks per round possible, will i need to take fighter levels?  <br> From reading the forums here I would imagine that would be a yes. But how many levels? Would four do? Or can I skip fighter and go 5 SD in a row now? <br> Or am I off in my guess and I can go straight monk till 20th, then go SD?<br><br> Well, any and all feedback would be appreciated folks! Thanks alot in advance!<br><br>Oh! One last thing - What other feats should I take to maximise my mage killing abilities?<br>Thanks again!<br><br>Feost<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Feost on 03/07/05 17:57</span></i></p>

I would slip 4 ftr lvls in pre-epic.  This will increase your bab, give you 2 bonus feats, and allow you to take the wep specialization feat.  Also, if you have the skill points, cross class spellcraft up to 20, it will give you an extra +4 to saves against spells.  <br><br>Another option is to go Monk 18/ SD 22.  You would be able to get Epic Dodge and Self Conceal 5.  You may not be the best offensively, but you will be hard as heck to hit with a wep or spell.  Surprisingly, Self Conceal works against spells as well as weapons.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

Monk 35 /SD 5 can get Self concealment V if need be, if the fights tend to be shorter then you can use empty body instead of taking all these feats. If you wanted SC 5 though the progression would be<br><br>33 Monk Self Concealment 1<br>34 Monk <br>35 Monk Self Concealment 2<br>36 Monk Self concealment 3<br>37 Monk<br>38 Monk <br>39 Monk Self concealment 4<br>40 Monk Self concealment 5<br><br>You would need to have to fit in epic dodge and 30 dex before level 32.<br>DEX=19 to start<br>Level 20 DEX =24<br>Level 21 Great DEX 1 <br>Level 24 DEX =26 Epic Dodge<br>Level 27 Great DEX 2<br>Level 28 DEX 28<br>Level 30 Great DEX 3<br>Level 32 DEX =30<br><br>You would still have your level 25 monk bonus feat to choose.

Hi Syrath,<br><br>Thanks alot for the break down on levels and feats. i just wanted to point out though that right now my character at level 12 has a 19 DEX, she didnt start with that on Character creation. Will this still work?<br><br>And thatnks to you other guys for helping out <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 03/07/05 20:28:43 (GMT) -- syrath1001<br><br>You would need to have to fit in epic dodge and 30 dex before level 32.<br>DEX=19 to start<br>Level 20 DEX =24<br>Level 21 Great DEX 1 <br>Level 24 DEX =26 Epic Dodge<br>Level 27 Great DEX 2<br>Level 28 DEX 28<br>Level 30 Great DEX 3<br>Level 32 DEX =30<br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

No , it wouldnt, You would need to start with 19 dex at level 1.<br><br>If not then I would just stick with epic dodge, take a lot of useful feats (SC5 is the most expensive feat to get in the game , 5 feats itself and up to 4 gt dex feats with a start of 18 dex). Empty body can provide your 50 concealment otherwise.<br><br>Syrath

Ya, I agree with Syrath about SC being the most expensive feat.  That's why I went the 22 SD route.  You get 1 extra bonus feat to use towards the SC.  Epic monk at 35 only gets 3 bonus feats (every 5 lvls) while Epic SD at 22 gets 4 bonus feats (every 3 lvls).<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

If all your concerned about is with killing mages a Rak druid/shifter/monk build comes to mind.  You can get pretty good AC, not great AB, but unlimited ice storms. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
