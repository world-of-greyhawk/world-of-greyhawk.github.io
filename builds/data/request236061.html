For the exalted sorceress...<br><br>What skills/feats/spells, etc. would you change (from epic page) on a world with immune:knockdown, immune:death magic, and +7 items?<br><br>Wouldn't really need discipline anymore, not sure about necro. focus, and epic mage armor useless.<br><br>Still a viable build?<br><br>What's generally the best PvP build for this type of world?<br><br>Thanks,<br>-Top

Well, do you have to level up, or can you create the char at level 40?<br><br>If you create at level 40, move the Monk level to 37 and the Pal level to 40, so you can max Taunt instead of Discipline. With your high Cha, you will be able to Taunt other spellcasters effectively, causing spell failure.<br><br>Probably switch the spell foci to Evocation instead of Necromancy due to the death magic immunity, or drop it completely for some other feats - spell penetration may be more useful if there are a lot of monks or high-SR races or monsters.<br><br>TM
