With the Elf active detect, it should be effective against H.I.P.S., which is the only point of going Elf with this build.  No experience penalty, though, and if you are content to use a rapier, really no harm other than the loss of skill points (44).  With Bard Song and appropriate equipment (see above) this build gets its discipline to 80 (+8 to all skills), which is very helpful if you have a nice sword and want to hold onto it.  Or if you don't like being knocked down (which is generally the end of the fight).

That is fair enough, but it is fair to say this build, while playable 1-40 (at least in my opinion) would be easier to level and more well rounded without maxing out its strength as you suggest, it won't be as effective in combat as a level 40.  And it is fair to say that I try to build to dominate at 40 now rather than playability up to 40.  <br><br>btw, reducing Str doesn't just affect your AB, it affects your damage (well, not much), your discipline save check (real important in a harsh environment), and the DC on your Dev Crit, which can be a big deal.<br><br>Thanks for the feedback, Finn.

I said AB/damage, though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   Fair enough, Discipline I forgot, but I didn't even consider the Devastating Critical DC because I despise the feat; IMO, it spoils the game. Each to his own. Also, do you not think +120 HP, +3 Fortitude saves and +1 Will saves are valuable at level 40? Even if you're losing one point of AB, damage, Discipline and Devastating DC.<br>_________________<br>"And one calculates <i>time</i> from the <i>dies nefastus</i> on which this fatality arose – from the <i>first</i> day of Christianity! – <i>Why not rather from its last?</i> – <i>From today?</i> – Revaluation of all values!"<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 04/12/06 17:00</span></i></p>

This is a variant but an important one: the elf ears remove what can be a fatal shortcoming in PvP, the vulnerability to HIPS.  Other than being stunned, which I also have a build for, nothing is more annoying than being picked apart by a foe who you cannot see. Unless you are Finneous, who'd prefer that to being dev critted.  Which, admittedly, does tend to frustrate if you were otherwise winning.  But it does take five feats and an unhealthy devotion to your strength to use effectively.

I haven't played a mod or a PW yet where I could afford heavy armor.  In most cases, I can barely afford a chain shirt.

Can Bards use Greatswords? I think he took rapier to qualify for CoT and then changed weapon, anyway, you're taking Epic Prowess and Epic Skill Focus: Discipline when you could take WF and EWF Greatsword, or better: take WF Greatsword at level 18, still spell won't be so great considering you're actually a melee and non-epic skill focus is quite weak.
