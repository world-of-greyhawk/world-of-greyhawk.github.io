not quite sure what you are after, as the link shows the benefits gained from the song at 30th level. <br><br>What exactly is this sweet spot?

Yes, the 'sweet spot' is generally considered to be the 16th level Song. This isn't so much due to getting little for the higher level Song as it is the prohibitive Perform ranks required for them. If it weren't for the ridiculous Perform rank requirements, taking your Song to level 25 or even 30 would be a no brainer.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

The only other factor you may want to consider is the benefit of a 20th level bard song over that of 16th. Purely because you can take Lasting Inspiration, giving a far longer duration of the song.

The 2 reasons to take more than 16 Bard levels are Lasting Inspiration (as noted above), and more spell castings per day. Spells per day max at 20, and you can take LI at level if it is on a general feat level in Epic. There isn't too much point to taking Bard above level 20 except for skill dumps - you won't be able to get Perform high enough to use the song to full effect unless there are some items that give you large Perform bonuses.<br><br>TM
