I have to ask. What's the point of Ranger in this build? A fighter would be better, you have skillpoints to spare, so invest them in x-classing prereq's for SD, you're not taking it until lvl 21 anyway. You could still dual-wield and gain feats on top. fighter12 has 7 feats, 3 for dual-wield, 2 for EWS and two more for whatever.<br><br>My thoughts.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Main point I didn't take it was because there's two versions of it (although not really close) already done. And because you pick up some extra ranger spells, so that on a low magic world, you don't have to waste Cleric Spell slots on Freedom of Movement, etc. Valid point though.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DragonRaider69 on 07/07/06 16:09</span></i></p>

Actually, I remember why I really took Ranger now. Shadowdancer requires Dodge, Mobility, 8 Move Silently, 10 Hide, and 5 Tumble. While Fighter can get Dodge and Mobility MUCH easier than the Ranger, NONE of those skills are class skills for the Fighter. Ranger gets Hide and Move Silently as Class Skills, meaning you only have to CC Tumble. I'm not 100% sure on the affect CCing all those skills would have, so, it might be best to stay Ranger, it might not. And as I mentioned above, having those extra Ranger Spells never hurts.

2 Favored Enemies and a few spells are nothing compared to EWS... I notice you only have 8 STR and no sneak or death attack, so your damage comes down to 1d6 +4 (with GMW) +9-14 Darkfire (Darkfire being your highest damage actually) +5 Divine Favor, and of course, STR boosting buffs, which, without War Domain, it gets donw to Bull's STR (+2 damage) so +6 damage from EWS is going to be most helpful...<br><br>Fighter will lose quite a lot of skillpoints, actually, I can't believe Grimnir said you have skillpoints to spare <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">

Now THAT would work, Grimnir. Yes, you lose HiPS, however, you would gain quite a few feats as you don't need Dodge or Mobility. And Rogue...Well, to me, you don't really need Hide or Move Silently with it, either. You can take it, but your stealth isn't going to work unless you're coming from a ways off. So you'd get the same general stuff, with sneaks and everything else.

Yeah, going the combo with rogue could be sweet in conjunction with KD. sneak and KD, slash a few, run and hide. <br><br>It's the wee little thing called xp-penalty that you would need to pay some attention. It can be avoided for most of the build with the right balance of levels perhaps.
