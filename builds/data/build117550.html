Quote: Posted 03/12/04 00:56:46 (GMT) by -JimDandy<br><br>    I had a quick question: does the barbarian damage reduction stack with the Dwarven Defender one (in the case you did that alignment shift)? I take it the feats that provide damage reduction stack with whatever you have.<br><br>    I'm trying to build a tough dwarven barbarian but it seems futile using only the basic classes. PrCs really add a lot to a build, that's for sure.<br>    Anyone have some thoughts on how to make a nice Battlerager (basically a crazy dwarf that chants himself into a rage)?<br>    I tried Barbarian/Figther/Weapon Master but I don't like him being that smart, hehe. I just want him to have two high ability scores; strenght and constition.<br>    As I see the ultimate Battlerager he has high DR, he has very high str and con (and even bigger as the rage kicks in), he's got Devastating Critcal, high BAB, a very good minimum damage that passes DR easily (so I figure a greataxe ), and hopefully a very high maximum damage as well<br>    Oh, and like 1000 hitpoint after the rage (or before, thihi).<br>    Ok, that's a lot to wish for, lol.<br>    I can't see this build taking RDD or DD levels exactly, so to me it get's hard. I figure something like an epic barbarian with figther and weaponmaster levels is the only build that can pull it off [shrugs].<br><br>    Kudos to the guy who did the Dwarven Clanfather, btw<br><br>    Jim<br><br><br>I tossed together a Barbarian 26 / Dwarven Defender 14 with a total damage redux of 24. Everything seemed to stack, but with the stats at the character creation, I was limited in what I wanted to do. Since I _needed_ 13 Dex for Dodge and Dwarven Defender, I had to blow feats to raise Str and Con. Also, I couldn't take ___ Rage as a Dwarven Defender, so I had to switch back to Barb for those feats. Of course, with flip flopping alignment in the mid 30s, this isn't really that feasable from 1 to 40 campaign-wise I guess. Finally, there was probably a way to ditch at least one of the +stat feats, but it didn't occur to me.<br><br>Dwarf Barbarian 26 / Dwarven Defender 14<br><br>Stats:<br>16 Str<br>13 Dex<br>19 Con<br>8 Wis<br>8 Int<br>6 Cha<br><br>+1 Con @ L4<br>+9 Str @ L8+<br><br>BUILD:<br><br>Barbarian 1: Dodge<br>Barbarian 2:<br>Barbarian 3: Toughness<br>Barbarian 4: +Con<br>Barbarian 5:<br>Barbarian 6: Power Attack<br>Barbarian 7:<br>Barbarian 8: +Str<br>Barbarian 9: Cleave<br>Barbarian 10:<br>Barbarian 11:<br>Barbarian 12: Great Cleave, +Str<br>Barbarian 13:<br>Barbarian 14:<br>Barbarian 15: Weapon Focus: Greataxe<br>Barbarian 16: +Str<br>Barbarian 17:<br>Barbarian 18: Improved Critical: Greataxe<br>Barbarian 19:<br>Barbarian 20: +Str<br>Barbarian 21: Great Constitution I<br>Barbarian 22:<br>---Turn Lawful Now---<br>Barbarian 22 / Dwarven Defender 1:<br>Barbarian 22 / Dwarven Defender 2: Great Strength I, +Str<br>Barbarian 22 / Dwarven Defender 3:<br>Barbarian 22 / Dwarven Defender 4:<br>Barbarian 22 / Dwarven Defender 5: Damage Reduction I<br>Barbarian 22 / Dwarven Defender 6: +Str<br>Barbarian 22 / Dwarven Defender 7:<br>Barbarian 22 / Dwarven Defender 8: Overwhelming Critical: Greataxe<br>Barbarian 22 / Dwarven Defender 9:<br>Barbarian 22 / Dwarven Defender 10: +Str<br>Barbarian 22 / Dwarven Defender 11: Damage Reduction II<br>Barbarian 22 / Dwarven Defender 12:<br>Barbarian 22 / Dwarven Defender 13:<br>---Turn Non-Lawful Now---<br>Barbarian 23 / Dwarven Defender 13: Mighty Rage, +Str<br>Barbarian 24 / Dwarven Defender 13: Terrifying Rage<br>Barbarian 25 / Dwarven Defender 13:<br>Barbarian 26 / Dwarven Defender 13: Damage Reduction III<br>---Turn Lawful Now---<br>Barbarian 26 / Dwarven Defender 14: Devestating Critical: Greataxe, +Str<br>_________________<br>"Doom DOOM DOOM!
