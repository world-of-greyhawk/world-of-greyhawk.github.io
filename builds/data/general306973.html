Why 14 str?  WHy 10 charisma?  why 10 dex?  See, str is overridden in shapes.  Charisma is useless to shapes (no cot, pal, bg).  And, afaik, dex is overridden aswell.  THis way you can start with 18 wis and get to dragon faster.  Why 9 monk?  (i am honestly asking, cuz i think you are gimping the character too much, but what do i know about shapes).

Unless you're on a server that modified shifter to give out bonuses for higher shifter levels I really wouldn't recommend going past 17 Shifter levels as that's when you get the last of the standard epic shifts, anything past that is just a waste.<br><br>Also the stats..not so great I'ld suggest something along the lines of..Dwarf 10 str 8 dex 16 con 18 wis 14 int 8 cha drop int/str for more con if you don't need the skill points, Con is a stat that'll shift over into several forms so it'll always be useful

There's one thing bothering me, all the information between {}, whatever they're called in english, I'm not really sure. It's too much, way too much, it makes it hard to read. When I see a build I want to know what specific choices you took and then I can advice improvements or say they're cool or something, but all the information that comes innate to the class is useless, we are ought to know them or else we wouldn't be builders. I always tell people who don't know this stuff to go and read the manual.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;by avado<br>Why 14 str?

In my opinion, the only good stuff of taking more than 1 level of Monk are Improved Evasion and Wholeness of Body, so it's not necesarilly bad. But yeah, there's absolutely no reason to take 10 charisma, it's 100% useless. There are some shifts that do not override all your stats avado, the Druid guide says Druid shifts do, but I never explained shifter shifts because I don't know them, ask Bromium in that matter. I do believe most shifts override all STR, DEX and CON. However, I'd only leave STR and DEX if by chance you were to specialize on a form that doesn't override them. With 9 Druid levels you can't empower level 5 spells, so the Rakshasa metamagic goodness doesn't apply here.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Yeah, I kind of figured about the DEX, STR, CHA part... I've got a sickness that won't let me play a build with negative modifiers... and mostly, I play the build in RP servers.

If you don't want to fight shifted constantly I'ld suggest higher levels in druid, more wisdom and using spells.<br><br>And strictly from a building point of view charisma and dexterity are both completely useless for a shifter you gain nothing out of either with a build like this, strength can be moderately useful if you don't want to be encumbered constantly but that's about it.

I agree with Kail here.  I remember when i started nwn, i hated those negative numbers, trying to make the "ultimate" character (yes, in the days of the commodore64, i played Pool of Radiance with characters with 18's across the board!)  Funny though, it didnt make the experience any better.  As i started to copy others' builds, i started to realize that my game experience changed very little when i had 8's or even 6's in my character sheet (that's when i really started to like Half Orcs!).  Remember, 8 vs 10 is ONLY -1 to your rolls, which is very little in the grand scheme of things.<br><br>Anyway, I understand totally you wanting to have 10's or more.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; -- Posted by Kail Pendragon  <br><br>Being hyperbolic is an integral part of Avado's being <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->
