A poster here named Storm6 posted an excellent fighter/weapon master/wizard build in the thread called "Wizard what for..." located here:<br>Click Here<br><br>I don't think I've ever found a better "spellsword" build that was both excellent at melee, had good spells, and good defense even with cloth only. It's so good, I've been telling everyone about it.<br><br>Here's the build, quoted without permission:<br><br>Fighter7/WM7/Wiz26<br><br>Race: Human<br>Base stat = 15 str, 14 dex, 14 con, 16 int, 8 wis, 8 char<br><br>Class Feat Bonus Feat Stat Value<br><br>Fgt 1 Dodge Mobility,P Attack<br>Fgt 2 Expertise<br>Fgt 3 Weaopn Focus<br>Fgt 4 Weapon Spec Str=15+1=16<br>Fgt 5<br>Fgt 6 Spring WhirlWind<br>WM1<br>WM2 Str=16+1=17<br>WM3 Improved crit<br>WM4<br>WM5<br>WM6 Thougness Str=17+1=18<br>WM7<br>Wiz 1<br>Wiz 2 Cleave<br>Wiz 3 Str=18+1=19<br>Wiz 4<br>Wiz 5 Greater Cleave Extend Spell<br>Wiz 6<br>Wiz 7 str=19+1=20<br>Wiz 8 Greater Str Str=20+1=21<br>Wiz 9<br>Wiz 10 Emp Spell<br>Wiz 11 Greater Str Str=21+1+1=23<br>Wiz 12<br>Wiz 13<br>Wiz 14 Overwhelm Crit<br>Wiz 15 Greater Int Str=23+1=24,<br>int=16+1=17<br>Wiz 16<br>Wiz 17 Epic weapon Foc<br>Wiz 18<br>Wiz 19 Str=24+1=25<br>Wiz 20 Devastate Max spell<br>Wiz 21<br>Wiz 22<br>Fgt 7 Epic Weapon spe Int=17+1=18<br>Wiz 23 Epic ward<br>Wiz 24<br>Wiz 25 Greater Int Int=18+1=19<br>Wiz 26 Epic Mage Armor pump str or int,<br>Int=19+1=20 or<br>Str=25+1=26<br><br>Summary<br><br>This build is extremely tight on feats, hence would not work with a sorc...because a wizard gets more feats.<br><br>I addition, WM requires an int of 13 anywayz, whereas a wiz casting level 9 spells need 19...so there is some synergy there. Whereas if a sorc was used, there would not be enough attribute points to cast level 9 spells (chr. 19) and get devastating crit (str=25).<br><br>Specilise in greatsowrd, wear light armour or robe (no room for still spell feats) and you get a Gandalf type charc. Able to fight in melee and cast level 9 spells with the 3 super epic feats...devastating critical, epic warding, and epic mage armor.<br><br>Buff yourself up and charge into battle, this guy is deadly, just like the real Gandalf.<br><br>[note: Personally, when I was playing around with this build, I went a little more into Int and Dex for better defense and fewer resists. I also took Spell Penetration and Spell Focus. So I went a little more mage with the feats and leaned more heavily on the fighter/WM levels alone for melee skills. I'd like to see Storm6 jump in and add his own comments. I'd love to see this build featured because I know I'm not the only one who yearns for the ultimate spellsword build.]<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 16:51</span></i></p>
