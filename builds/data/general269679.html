In general rule the scimitar/rapier is definitely stronger if you can hit through all its threat range, that's going to work all the time, it only becomes weaker if you do not crit through all its threat range.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/29/07 21:57</span></i></p>

you cannot cast keen edge on the hammer, but you can add the ability "keen" to them in the toolset.

Are you going for Dev Crit or not? With Dev Crit, all that matters is the range, not the multiplier (dead is dead....). Without it, it's a simple calculation: 2 * 45% = 90% bonus damage or 3 * 15% = 45% bonus damage. Assuming they are hittable at 12, scim is better.<br><br>TM
