Is this build possible? Maybe SD/Fighter/RDD? Your thoughts please.

You need either Bard or Sorcerer levels to be an RDD.  You'll need to say a bit more to let us know what exactly you're looking for.  Tank with epic dodge and RDD is a little vague.  You'll basically end up with (Bard or Sorc.)/RDD/(Rogue or Shadowdancer).<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Now that I think about it is it possible to get Epic Dodge, 7 lvls of WM AND dev crit. I'm thinking best road would be finesse fighter w/ 11+ SD lvls. the 11th SD lvl for maxing hide, move silently and tumble. I want mostly WM and fighter lvls because they get more health points every level than a shadowdancer does. Scratch the RDD, on the server i play on there's a low percentage of being able to become one.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Pickleweaseler on 02/16/05 00:48</span></i></p>

No guarrantees it will be a competent build, because the STR and DEX requirements are high coupled with feat requirements for weapon master, but here goes. <br><br>First race: elf, and human come to mind right away.  I think I we need a high dex though so we'll start with an elf.<br><br><i>Race</i> Elf <br><br>Attributes:  You need a 25 Str and a 25 dex, I think I'll go str heavy, but you need a high STR and DEX to begin with, at least a 13 INT and the rest to CON.<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 16<br>DEX 18<br>CON 10<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 8<br><br>Leveling: partially decided by AB, partially by feats. We need at least 16 attribute bonuses (10 from level increases, 6 from epic feats).  We need bonus feats, We want at least 16 rogue levels (3 feats: improved evasion, defensive roll and epic dodge).  We'll go for 7 WM levels, leaving 16 fighter levels. In epic levels we need overwhelming critical, and devastating critical, epic weapon focus and epic weapon specialization would be nice too.  Pre-epic we need dodge, mobility, spring attack, expertise, whirlwind attack, weapon focus, improved critical, power attack, cleave and great cleave. Weapon specialization, knockdown and toughness would be nice too.<br><br><i>Leveling guide</i><br>Level 1: Rogue<br>Levels 2-5: Fighter<br>Level 6: Rogue<br>Levels 7-10: Fighter<br>Level 11: Rogue<br>Levels 12-15: Weapon Master<br>Level 16: Rogue<br>Levels 17-19: Weapon Master<br>Levels 20-21: Fighter<br>Levels 22-28: Rogue<br>Levels 29-32: Fighter<br>Levels 33-36: Rogue<br>Levels 37-38: Fighter<br>Levels 39-40: Rogue<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Fighter 16<br>Rogue 17<br>Weapon Master 7<br><br><i>Attribute bonuses</i><br>Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 40 will increase STR<br>Levels 28, 32 and 36 will increase DEX<br><br><i>Feats</i><br>Level 1: Dodge<br>Level 2: Weapon Focus ()<br>Level 3: Mobility, Expertise<br>Level 5: Weapon Specialization ()<br>Level 6: Spring Attack<br>Level 8: Whirlwind Attack<br>Level 9: Improved Critical ()<br>Level 10: Knockdown<br>Level 12: Power Attack, Weapon of Choice ()<br>Level 15: Cleave<br>Level 18: Great Cleave<br>Level 21: Great Strength I, Epic Weapon Focus ()<br>Level 24: Great Strength II<br>Level 27: Great Strength III, Improved Evasion<br>Level 30: Overwhelming Critical (), Great Dexterity I<br>Level 32: Devastating Critical ()<br>Level 33: Great Dexterity II<br>Level 34: Defensive Roll<br>Level 36: Great Dexterity III<br>Level 38: Epic Weapon Specialization ()<br>Level 39: Great Dexterity IV, Epic Dodge<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 26<br>DEX 25<br>CON 10<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 8<br><br>AB with mundane weapon of choice should be<br>41/36/31/26<br><br>Hit points will be 332 (maximum every level)<br><br>Saving Throws will be<br>Fortitude 19<br>Reflexes 29 <br>Will 15<br><br>You should have 292 skill points to spend as you would like.<br><br>It won't be a great build, but it might be fun. Watch out for the XP penalty. I don't think that shadowdancer will work as well because you need a hide of 10 which means that you can't take any levels until level 18 and you need at least 13 levels to get epic dodge (need to take it as a bonus feat).  It could be done, but I think rogue would end up a bit better.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
