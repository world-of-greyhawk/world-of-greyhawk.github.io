You should drop those Improved Sneak Attack feats. Unless it has been fixed without me knowing at all, they dont add damage to death attacks unless you also have Sneak Attack (eg Rogue or Blackguard levels).

Interesting build Thax!<br><br>Now let me give you a couple of suggestions.<br><br>*You found out yourself that you could get 1 AB by going druid 12 preepic, well done.<br><br>*I would monk at 5th lvl to avoid cross classing hide and MS, netting you more skillpoints and making assassin available earlier.<br><br>*UMD helps a lot the build by giving you access to scrolls for buffs you do not have in your druidical selection.<br><br>*ISA does not stack with death attack unless you already have sneak attack from rogue or blackguard lvls. Since you are not left with much choice there, I suggest taking ESF: hide and MS.<br><br>*start with 8 CHA and 9 STR for extra carrying capacity when in human form.<br><br>*You probably count on getting your hands on fox's cunning scrolls to buff INT and so having an odd score makes some sense. Still I would start with 16 INT freeing up 3 points. You could put 1 into STR (going STR 10 considering the above change) and 2 into CON for extra HPs unshifted and increased survivability at lower lvls. Or otherwise leave STR at 8 and set CON at 12 for more extra HP. This is especially true if you can manage to cap your INT since capping would leave you with a useless odd score.<br><br>*Druid buffs can give you capped STR (empowered bull's STR, AoV, Blood frenzy) for +6 AB,  +7 WIS for +3 AC, another +5 AC from Barkskin, elemental DR, stoneskin and GS for non dragon form, regeneration, summons and buffs for your companion, grease and entangle coupled with freedom of movement and more. Use your powers wisely and you'll fare good. Ultravison/darkness and II are your friends. Add in UMD to make use of clerical scrolls for buffing...nice!<br><br>* One more druid lvl would open up 8th lvl spells, which you can use to extend AoV. I think it's worth the cost of -1 DC on death attack.<br><br>*I suggest you to drop luck of heroes to make room for extended spell, very useful for your buffs.<br><br>*Dragon shape DR is 40/+6<br><br>* Put points either in listen or spot, not both. I question the usefulness of only 21 ranks in discipline, you're better off dropping it. UMD should be 41 or even 36 if you find you need skillpoints. Tumble should be 40 (only base ranks in multiples of 5 count). With that one more druid lvl to open up 8th lvl spell slots, you could set spellcraft at 41 for a final score of 45 and +1 to saves vs spells. Put points in search, set trap, disable trap, you won't regret it. You have access to them through assassin, don't waste the opportunity of having another ace up your sleeve. Some points in open locks is not a bad idea either.<br><br>*take the metamagic feats earlier in your career, at that point you'll need them more than your combat feats IMO.<br><br>A dragon with a good Death Attack. High sneak skills.  Darkness/ultravision and II available. Able to set traps. Able to disarm its opponents. Now, that sounds cool! I think we've found a Shadow Dragon.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Wait for me Dragon, we'll meet in the sky<br>By fire and magic, I'm sworn<br>Hell is calling, we cannot be denied<br>Fly to the blackness of the Storm<br><br>We must die to be reborn!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 02/28/06 12:17</span></i></p>

Hm, this is a mean Dragon, literally. I think you should lower INT, like Kail says to increase starting points. With 14 starting INT, and 1 point taken from CHA you have 8 points to play with, for CON, STR mostly. You really don't have the skillpoints to spare, so if you can manage to start with 16 INT, and putting 2 points eachto STR and CON then of course that would be best. Your stealth skills in DS is quite nice considering the high DEx, evn though you get a -8 size penalty. Your Death attack DC is a very nice 38 unbuffed. It would have a nice chance on some classes. Another thing worth noting is that your damage will be hifgher than what the sheet says because of +6 claws(right Kail?).<br><br>This is a very nice, and surely very FUN build. And even rare, I would think. I'm sure this is what would have happened had Grizz and Kail cooperated on a build. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>PS, you won't need monk at lvl 1, so I second the motion to have it moved until lvl 5.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Of course taking Monk in level 5 is better, but wait a minute, have you seen the alignment? it took me like two hours to test a fail-proof legal way of changing my alignment to chaotic at level 1 (but I haven't found one to make it lawful), having Monk at level 5 would mean to start as druid neutral evil, change to lawful evil at level 4 for level 5, and go back to neutral evil in that same level! if you have a legal way of doing that in human time, let me know.<br><br>O.o Right, I took Luck of Heroes without noticing I didn't got Extended Spell.<br><br>Well, increasing Druid to 15 is ok for level 8 spells, but it would be at level 37 to gain spellcraft bonus I guess, the full penalties are -1d6 DA with -1 DC,<br><br>Thanks for the skills suggestions, I got confused with so many, I can't believe you think they're too little. I think it would be great to use a second level of Monk at level 40 (another DC less... crap) to take discipline to 43, but now that needs alignment change again......... but who cares? it's level 40, I'll have no problem by then.<br><br>The problem with the assassin bonus feats is: I don't really have choice, since ISA doesn't works, I only have great DEX (which is actually better now), for some reason I don't have any of the other to choose, I already got Epic Reflexes as bonus feat if you notice, I don't know what's MS, but I can't choose it, can't choose ESF either.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;with Dragon TS do you even need listen or spot?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Um......

MS stands for move silently, <b>to be able to select ESF you must have already 20 base ranks in the skill you want to focus in</b>. ESF: hide/move silently would compensate the mali you receive to your stealth skills because of size when in DS (-8). Great DEX is a waste for you, ESF would do some good instead.<br><br>I don't think skills are too little (altough they are much less then in PnP indeed) I think <b>skill points</b> are too little usually <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Increasing druid lvls can be done or not done it is no biggy, just personal preference.

A module may allow changing aligments for free, I don't see how anything can be called "illegal". Everything's for the builder to decide. His choice of words was poor <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  Of course, if you're playing SP, and the module doesn't allow such alignment shifts, using the console can be understood as cheating. Even in this case, if the alignment change makes you enjoy your game more, who has the right to tell you you're not allowed to do that, that it's illegal? After all, it's your game and you payed for it (I hope)... each to his own, no? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Off topic and ranting, sorry.<br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm

Nice build BTW, I remember I tried this when you posted about making a Shadow Dragon in Build Requests (IIRC).<br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm

Yeah, I meant without using console commands, since I was making a full change of lawful to chaotic being level 1, you really can't get in a module and get alignmetn change for your deeds, you'll die for not leveling up first. I might take Kail's advice and go with evil/good alignmetn change, I actually made it like that the other time so that after the change was done there was no further change, but changing good/evil is much easier than lawful/chaotic.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;to be able to select ESF you must have already 20 base ranks in the skill you want to focus in.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>LOL, and I was thinking it wasn't my fault, it may be that I didn't see I got them because I might have skipped the skill distribution until the end when making the build, so I didn't really have 20 at the time, but a lot of points in reserve.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Nice build BTW, I remember I tried this when you posted about making a Shadow Dragon in Build Requests (IIRC).</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I never got the memo <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"> , but yeah, I posted a little bit about multiclassing with Assassin.<br><br><br>Working on the changes now.
