Hey I have been surfing the epic character builds forum looking for a good build to fit perfectly into the world I play in.  Ive come pretty close, but not exactly perfect since there are some restrictions that I have to take into account.  Here are some of the more important guidelines I have to work with:<br><br>1.  SD is banned<br>2.  Magic Vestment and GMW are +5 only at level 20+<br>3.  +5 Keen weapons can be found easily, but to fully take advantage of the crafting system, being able to cast both is (somewhat) important but by no means necessary.<br>4.  PM have a -10 AC<br>5.  AC is a huge factor here, as weapon damages are sick and DR is relatively useless PVP.. mainly people do not want to be hit.<br>6.  By the same token AB is important because of AC's<br>7.  +12 to abilities from items is easy to get for 3 ability scores.<br>8.  Alignment switches are not a problem at all.<br>9.  It is relatively easy to level.<br>10. Melee is the way to go.<br>11. The best PVPer that I know of has a 59 AB and 69 AC with Epic Dodge and SC IV (with some enhancements from reincarnations)<br>12. The only immunities on items are fear and knockdown and are very easy to get.<br><br>Ok now on to the best equiptment I can get my hands on (AC wise)... +4 Full plate, +3 Clothes, +4 Helm, +2 Boots w/haste, +3 Ammy of Natural and a +4 tower shield.<br><br>Also I'd like to mention that I will have the ability to use 20 "points" toward the following things:<br><br>1)  +1 to Ability Points at 4 pts each <br>2)  Feats ( First and Second )04 pts each <br>Feats ( Third and Fourth )06 pts each <br><br>So ie: +4 to an abilty (16 pts) and a feat (4 pts) or 4 feats (8pts for first two and 12pts for next two)<br><br>I am open to just about anything so any suggestions would be appreciated.  Figured this was a pretty cool challenge and I hope some of you can help me out.<br><br>Some ideas I have toyed around with are:<br><br>20 Cleric/ 16 Bard/ 4 Fighter<br>20 Rogue/ 13 Fighter/ 7 WM<br><br>...but again anything would be great.  Thanks and sorry for the length.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By apper76 on 01/04/06 16:19</span></i></p>

Monk/Wiz/AA is a good choice as well.<br><br>With people being KD immune, you might want to be the cheesy run and snipe build.<br><br>Cleric (Wiz/bard) AA might be another choice.  Zen archery plus your cleric levels for buffing would be good.

Ok a build I’ve been working on but haven’t looked on the forums about is probably a common build but I think the Idea will work. <br><br>Fighter 5<br>Bard 25<br>RDD 10 <br><br>The Idea is with the high amounts of Bard levels is to use Curse Song to lower there Skills &amp; AC then to use Taunt to lower there AC more. Then using Called shot Arm to lower there AB so that they can’t hit you. As it’s cumulative as you can keep hitting them and lowering there AB (i'm gussing a lot a people will not have a high Dic as you can be KD immune). You also have access to all Bard spells and a nice Bard song that’ll last for a while so you can use most of them as your Curse songs. <br><br>The build is along the lines of<br><br>Str 16 – All Stats here<br>Dex 12<br>Con 10<br>Wis 8<br>Int 12<br>Cha 16<br><br>Pre Epic<br>Bard 16<br>Fighter 4 <br><br>Epic<br>4 Bard<br>8 RDD<br>1 Bard<br>2 RDD<br>4 Bard<br><br>Feats pre Epic<br><br>Toughness<br>Curse Song<br>Extend Spell<br>Weapon Focus<br>Called Shot<br>Lingering Song<br>Imp Crit<br>Skill focus – Perform<br>Skill focus – Taunt<br>Weapon Spec<br><br>Epic<br>Epic Prowess<br>Lasting Inspiration<br>Armor Skin<br>EWF <br>Epic Skill focus – Perform <br>Epic Weapon Spec<br>Epic Skill focus – Taunt<br>Epic Acid Resist<br><br><br>All unbuffed &amp; Mundane items<br>AB – 42<br>AC – 36<br>HP – 364<br>Skill points – 234<br>Fort – 20<br>Will – 20<br>Reflex – 22<br><br>Skills <br>Taunt 43<br>Perform 43<br>Tumble 40<br>Spell Craft 40<br>Discipline 40<br>Heal 20<br>Lore 8<br><br>You can probably Drop the Skill focus on Both if Skills are easy to come by on Items. Then you would have 2 Pre epic &amp; 2 epic feats to use<br><br><br>not sure how it would work in pratice but i thought it seemed like it would work well.<br>bgw

Why?  it gives you the AB, AC, lv 9 divine magic, +5 to vestment and gmw, epic dodge, excellent crit range, decent crit damage (which is really needed in high magic worlds.  You gotta multiply all that magic bonus damage  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  ), you get evasion, uncanny dodge, imp combat casting, high tumble, even highr ac and ab with buffs!  You already say you can get extra stats to use!  Heck, you could get a natural dex of 32 AND wis of 20!  It would be the ultimate character!<br><br>Unfortunately, you cant do it.  SD is banned  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif"> <br><br>Because of that one fact, i would suggest you find another server.  I know that sounds harsh, but there are so many EXCELLENT servers out there to rot on this one.<br><br>just my 2 cents.<br><br>Peace

you should goto a server thats more your skill level if you need to beg for help for something uber, the balance on that server is so out of the norm that characters posted here will very likely not work very well, if at all.<br><br>*nod nod*

Okay, lets look at your requirements:<br>1 - damage comes from weapon enhancements, so no str-builds (i.e. no Ftr/Brd/WM)<br>2 - AC is important, so you want a dex build.<br>3 - The best guy there is an epic dodger with SC feats.<br><br>So, looks to me like we are talking about a halfling Ftr/WM/Rogue. There are  number of those builds around, do a search. That will let you get a high dex, ED, SCV, high AB, etc. I would say to spend your points on +4 to Dex, and 1 feat (probably one of the WM requirements to help you start taking WM sooner). You will want lots of WM levels for AB, a sprinkling of Rogue levels for periodic tumble and UMD dumps and ED requirements, and just enough fighter levels to get the WM requirements and maybe WS/EWS (but if the weapon damages are so high, that may not matter). Something like Fighter 8/Rogue 13/WM 19, or Fighter 5/Rogue 13/WM 22.<br><br>TM
