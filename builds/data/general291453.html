Hey guys, just been thinking that it might be a good idea for people to post their favourite game servers since there aren't many good ones left. Most notably, it's hard to find PRC servers. Not to mention I'm sure I'd enjoy playing with some of you.<br><br>Thoughts?

World of Amon<br><br><a href="http://www.worldofamon.com" target="_blank">http://www.worldofamon.com</a>  <br><br>I'd call it a fairly high magic world now.

I play in Athas Reborn in PW Story. It's a true to life recreation of the DarkSun campaign setting with custom everything. Why kill yet another ork with a +1 longsword wielding gnome when you can strap on a bone breastplate and kill an enraged tembo with an obsidian gythka, or even with a fully tweaked psionics system? We have all the favorite player races; kreen, half giants, pterrans, muls and aarakocras. Our elves are fast. Our dwarves are obsessed and our spells expanded and specialized. Athas is a world ruined by evil epic wizards who now fight for the few scraps of remaining power. Think LOTR meets Mad Max and you have a good idea what we are about. Download our haks and come have a good time with some bad people!

play Dragon Mountian. It is nwn1 world with a custom Prc implementation and CEP2. We have over 1000 area, 5 cities, active guilds, and a slight RP flair. It is an action based server mostly, but the active Dms run rp based storylines.<br><br>we have eliminated several prc classes for balance, but mostly to eliminate lag or other technical issues. this is a very low lag server. We continue to look at opening other classes as well. <br><br>We have a Custom quest system and a 'token' system that allows the creation of custom items. You have multiple quests at each level beyond 5th and bosses at each level. Most levels have more than one boss so multiple runs to 40 do not mean you will face the same boss 2x.<br><br>We favor expert builds. it is a very hard world and will require a great build to solo, but it is a party based server so people will often switch chars to party with you. Many people have been on the world more than 3 years.<br><br><br>If you like the epic builds highlighted on these forums, we have a 40+ level castle area where most of these builds have been implemented for you to fight. A great way to test what you may consider the 'ultimate' build. I think you will find any build fully tested by the mountian. Can you climb to the top?<br><br>We just implemented a Capture the flag full PvP system as well for higher level chars.<br><br><a href="http://www.forgotten-worlds.net/forum/" target="_blank">http://www.forgotten-worlds.net/forum/</a><br><br>or <a href="http://www.forgotten-worlds.net/" target="_blank">http://www.forgotten-worlds.net/</a><br>_________________<br>no matter where you go, there you are!!!<br><br>come see Dragon Mountian - cep and limited prc, but still adding new content.<br><br><a href="http://www.rpgmods.net/forgottenworlds" target="_blank">www.rpgmods.net/forgottenworlds</a><br>_________________<br>no matter where you go, there you are!!!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By yyrkoon on 03/05/08 15:50</span></i></p>
