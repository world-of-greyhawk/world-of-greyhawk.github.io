I made a barbarian build that has all rages and couple other epic feats... Originally the name was The Thundering Barbarian, but Lockindal has already used that name. So I changed the name to "The Screaming Barbarian". The name sounds funny to me... so I am using it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">   <br><br>-The Screaming Barbarian Build-<br>Race: Half-Orc *<br>Class: Fighter<br>Alignment: True

Alrighty then. I'll give it another try.<br><br>By the way, I didn't use the manual, I based on it on the site's information. Also you dont minid if I touch up your build? There are some good feats you could have taken.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrPaladin on 07/29/04 09:25</span></i></p>

If you want to do dwarf version of this build...<br><br>All you have to do is to change the starting stats.<br><br>Race: Dwarf<br>Class: Fighter<br>Alignment: True Neutral<br><br>Ability[modifier]<br><br>STR: 18[4]<br>DEX: 10[0]<br>CON: 18[4]<br>WIS: 8 [-1]<br>INT: 10[0]<br>CHA: 6 [-2]<br><br>The only difference is how the ending stats will be. Since you don't have low DEX, you will be able to get higher saves, mainly Reflex. As for INT, you would not lose any skill points, same as other build except that you don't waste any points in that in the beginning of the character creation.<br><br>I will post the drawf version in couple hours. I am fixing few errors in the layout<br><br>EDIT: By the errors, I meant, both instruction and the build itself. I messed up the placement of the fighter level and I am fixing that.<br><br>EDIT EDIT: You can copy the same leveling instruction from the first version of the Screaming Barbarian and just change the race, and the ability stats.<br><br>The level layout is basically the same. So it doesn't make any diffence except for the ending stats as I said before.<br><br>I will post the result when I get back later tonight.<br><br>Anuis<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Anuis on 07/29/04 21:36</span></i></p>

Ok. The result of doing the dwarf barbarian is not much of difference.<br><br>The only change in the stats is the reflex. It only increases by 1.<br><br>However... you can improve this build even more if you switched something. If you drop the Great Strength, by doing this you will have to wait little bit longer to get Devastating Critical(the last feat selection). But in place of that, you can either put in Armor Skin, increasing the AC to 16(with tumble skill included), or something else that you think is necessary. Possibly epic skill focus for taunt skill for greater chance of defeating the concentration skill if the enemy has one.<br><br>Hope you will enjoy this build as I have.<br><br>Anuis
