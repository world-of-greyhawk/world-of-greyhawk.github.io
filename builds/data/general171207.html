What you ask for is too general - do you want your character to be a fighter? Cleric? Spellsword? Rogue-type character? "high AB, AC and dev crit" is what most of PVP melee builds have.<br>Also, try browsing the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117384", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>indexed list of builds</a> - it's not there just for fun.<br><br>Well, you can also check <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "160882", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>this</a> guy - although he's not a pure melee fighter.

What you ask for basically forces you into one role. A red dragon disciple. Look at pretty much any builds using that, and you'll get someone with high AC/AB and dev crit. The character probably won't be very good at pvp though. I've got a couple varations to get all three myself, and it still faulters because you have to give up extreme high strength to get high AB making your dev crit more of a lucky shot than a reliable offense. Second you won't have very good saves so a sorcerer will chew you up, and third your hp won't be all that spectacular, so any high damage attacks really are felt.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>
