i play on a server that has a lvl 20 cap. i really stink at building my own characters and would like to see if someone could work up a character for me. he must be a dwarf, not evil, must take at least 3 levels in every class choice, i want him to be a melee tank with high ab and crits. and would like to use a warhammer. i have made a couple builds in a lvl up mod but havent hit on one i like so far. im thinking fighter/wm.....and possibly dd. but im not sure on what feats to take, when to take them and how to do my skill points. i will be studying this build to try and better my skills at it. if anybody could help me out here it would be greatly appreciated.

You wouldn't fit much DD in anywho and rogue is much neater.. anyway I would love to make a major build sheet and screenshot it to death.. but I'm not here for 2 or 3 days so uhrm.. yay! That's just what I'd go for though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-DaMouse

The 1st character I ran through the NWN OC was a Dwarf Fighter/WM with Hammer Focus and Spec. I also worked on dual-weapons skills, but you may not have the room with a 20 level cap. (Also keep in mind the NWN OC is a cake-walk compared to most PWs)<br>3 rogue levels would make an intersting addition. I'll be interested to see what you come up with.<br>P.S. You can't go wrong adding a few skill points to Heal if there are Heal Kits readily available on the PW.<br>_________________<br>"Orbis non Sufficit"<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By wurm657 on 08/21/05 15:17</span></i></p>

Consider a paladin/fighter. 16paladin/4ftr is a really strong melee build.<br>_________________<br>Be realistic...
