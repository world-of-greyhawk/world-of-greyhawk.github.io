If you want to really just slay the dragon by dmg, then I would say 21ranger/15paladin or cleric/4ftr. Then you get extreme dmg against dragons, good AB and a good amount of HP. Plus you recieve immunity to fear, so the dragons only options is to wack you with spells or dmg. sword and shield is the best for overall combat, but if you take greatsword you will be extremely cool and dragonslayer 2tm!

The real issue slaying PC dragons is the monk druid combo. This means hitting the beast is the major issue, as AC can easily crack 60 without items on a well planned build. The two ways around this are arcane archers for the incredible ac and more mobility than a drakeshape can muster in between terrain features OR an arcane caster to rain icestorms (for PCs with evasion) or chain lightning down on him. Back when HotU came out, drakeshape was a huge imbalancer for our server, but through trial and error we learned to slay the little beasties. Good luck, and good hunting.

Ice Storm or Chain Lightning? forget about that, if you're using a mage you simply cast Epic Warding, then Mordenkainen's Disjunction and then just spam Isaac's Greater Missile Storms (Empowered, Maximized) until he's dead (make sure to be hasted), of course also use Time Stop if it's not banned, if it were not banned, the caster would win quite easily, Time Stop just owns on PvP.<br><br>Arcane Archers can kill dragons easily by exploiting a dragon's main disadvantage: the excessively huge size, if you can hide on a small walkway or somewhere where the dragon won't fit he will have no chances. Spamming Called Shot Leg sometimes works even on big areas where they can move, but if you can't escape from the dragon and he starts to hit you on melee, then most likely he'll kill you since even if you can hit him, he'll also hit you, where his big HP will make him the winner.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

A Shifter's Basilisk or Medusa gaze has a 1 in 20 chance at an instant win.<br><br>Dev crit is often removed from servers but stone gaze isn't.  If your server has an auto fail on 1 rule, then you can try and spam stone gazes till you get him.  SR doesn't protect form it.  You'll just have to pray for a 1 of course, and to not get toasted by him in the process.  LOL<br><br>Other than THAT... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   should be easy HAHAHA

^ he's just obsessed with shifter builds <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>it's not a bad idea, though... i mean, spamming basilisk glare IS a bad idea, unless you're suicidal, but a shifter build would be pretty effective against dragons, i think. you could take empower spell, and spam ice storms as a rakshasa... or you could take dragon shape yourself, and duke it out dragon-a-dragon.... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">

I know you have to pick a shifter for everything Bromium, but to use a skill to win on a roll of 1 is not that much of a tactic...<br><br>I wouldn't pick a shifter to fight a dragon, since the dragon shape is the strongest head to head melee shift, using a Rakshasha is even less effective than being a Sorcerer, the useful effect of a Rakshasha is making you immune to most magic, which doesn't helps much against a melee opponent, a Sorcerer can use Mords to dispel the useful Druid buffs (say, just dropping its STR buff is already useful, a Druid can self buff STR to cap) and IGMS deals more damage than Ice Storm... and that without even mentioning Epic Warding and Time Stop, so don't use a Rakshasha.<br><br>I think I'd use a Sorcerer 36 / Paladin 1 / Blackguard 3 with Divine Shield and Improved Expertise... dragons get good Stunning Fist DC since they have a lot of WIS, if I were the dragon I'd use it on a caster, since 3 round paralisis is great, so having high saves is useful.<br><br>Beating a dragon with a dragon can work, though it depends on what build is your enemy using, a fully buffed Cleric 20 / Druid 18 / Monk 2 (or variants) beats the rest of the dragons pretty much always, Cleric's buffs beat just about every third class you can pick for dragon's stats.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Hasted Monk Palemaster (or RDD) combo with Epic Dodge could do it.<br><br>Palemaster or RDD to make you immune to the Stunning fist attempts.  Epic Dodge to give you a free miss.<br><br>Monk to give you speed and extra Kama attacks.<br><br>Monk would also give you Improved Evasion in order to take NO damage (or 1/2 if you fail your save) from the dragon breath.<br><br>You could try your palemaster arm attacks (again, pray for a 1).<br><br>You could summon a Bodak (if the level is right) and pray he didn't think of death ward.<br><br>*shrug*

a rak can easily get over 80 ac on a +5 ac item server with imp expertise, which won't disable ice storm abilities.<br><br>And I haven't tried this myself, but I heard that the old 26/4/10 bard/paladin/bg/rdd with maxed heal skill can win around 32 sonic damage on whispers and can heal at least 51+d20 per kit assuming bard song isn't nerfed. with displacement, and a decent base hp you might win.
