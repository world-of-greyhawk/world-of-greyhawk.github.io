In the elder days PnP days, long ere WotC was even dreamed of, there were a group of Paladins who represented each alignment.  There were the Myrrakhans of the Neutral Good order, and Ilriggers of the Lawful/Evil, Lyons of the Lawful/Neutral, and there were the dreaded Arrikhans of the Neutral Evil gods.  These knights were skilled in poisons, torture, received save bonuses in much the same way CoTs receive theirs, and could generate extra damage through their faith and divine grants.  This was my homage to those knights of yesteryear.  This is a unique build and has not been done before, and it presents many RP possibilities.  It is by far from a powerbuild, but it has enough weapons in its arsenal to deal with most situations.  Strong in hitpoints, lordly in saves, Terrifying Rage and Dev Crit to deal with the riff-raff, and some fun Divine powers to quell the damage resistant.  There is a slight alignment change along the way, but should be doable in many environments.  <br><br><br><b>The Arrikhan: Glorius Hellsword</b><br>Class: Barbarian16/Blackguard4/CoT20<br>Title: Arrikhan <br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Neutral Evil to Neutral<br>Or Chaotic Evil to Chaotic Neutral<br>Playable: 1-40, mid-magic environments<br><br><b>Attributes</b><br>Str16 (26)<br>Int12<br>Wis8<br>Dex10<br>Con14<br>Chr15 (20)<br><br><b>Level Guide</b><br>1 Barbarian1, Power Attack, Cleave<br>2 Barbarian2<br>3 Barbarian3, WF: Scimitar*<br>4 Barbarian4, Str17<br>5 Barbarian5<br>6 Barbarian6, Blindfighting<br>7 Barbarian7<br>8 Blackguard1, Str18<br>9 Blackguard2, Extra Smiting<br>10 Barbarian8<br>11 Barbarian9<br>12 Blackguard3, Divine Might, Str19<br>13 Barbarian10<br>14 Barbarian11<br>15 Blackguard4, Divine Shield<br>16 Barbarian12, Str20<br>17 CoT1 <i>must be non-evil at this point</i><br>18 CoT2, Improved Crit: Scimitar, Toughness<br>19 CoT3<br>20 CoT4, Great Cleave, Str21<br>21 CoT5, Great Str I<br>22 Barbabrian13<br>23 Barbarian14<br>24 Barbarian15, Terrifying Rage, Str23<br>25 CoT6, Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>26 CoT7<br>27 CoT8, Great Str II, Overwhelming Crit: Scimitar<br>28 CoT9, Str25<br>29 CoT10, Dev Crit: Scimitar<br>30 CoT11, Great Chr I<br>31 CoT12<br>32 CoT13, Chr17<br>33 CoT14, Armor Skin, Great Chr II<br>34 CoT15<br>35 CoT16<br>36 CoT17, Great Chr III, Chr20<br>37 CoT18, Epic Prowess<br>38 CoT19<br>39 CoT20, ESF: Listen<br>40 Barbarian16, Str26<br><br><b>Combat Vitals</b><br>AB: 42/37/32/27 (15-20/x2)<br>Maximum Buffed AB w/+5 Gear and Taunt: 80/75/70/65<br>AC: 27 (Full plate and Shield)<br>HP: 552 (672 Raging)<br>DR: 2/-<br><br><b>Saves</b><br>Fort: 43 (52 in Wrath)<br>Will: 30 (39 in Wrath)<br>Reflex: 34 (43 in Wrath)<br><br><b>Skills</b> 210<br>Discipline: 43 (51)<br>Taunt: 43 (48)<br>Intimidate: 43 (48)<br>Tumble: 20<br>Hide: 5<br>Listen: 31 (40)<br><br><b>Special Abilities: </b><br>Terrifying Rage: DC: 49-58 (55-63 buffed)<br>Divine Wrath: DR 15/+3, +9AB/Damage, +9 saves<br>Divine Shield for +5 to +11 AC<br>Divine Might for +5 to +11 damage<br>Devastating Crit DC: 38, (44 buffed, 46 buffed and if victim is terrified)<br>Grearer Rage &amp; Bulls Strength<br>Smite Evil x3: +5-11 AB, +20 divine damage<br>Smite Goodx3: +5-11AB<br>Strong Saves<br><br><b>Weaknesses</b><br>No UMD or Exotic Weaponry<br>No Knockdown feats<br>Mediocre AC<br>Requires a brief Alignment change in the teens<br><br><b>Notes on Playing</b><br>Remember to start either Neutral or Chaotic Evil at creation.  As one progresses through the pre-epic career, you gradually want to start shifting towards the Neutral Axis.  After the last BG level is taken at 15th, one will need to make the push towards either Chaotic Neutral or just Neutral (if Neutral Evil was your base).  Before the 17th level is taken, one will need to be one of those two alignements, and stay there after that.

Thank you for this one. I automatically love any build that uses Barbarian and Blackguard. I always wished I could have the "Divine Champion" class to pair with Blackguard as well. The way you make use of CoT in this build does not make it too painful of an experience, even if one were wishing to role play it. <br><br>I dont use Dev Crit, but I wouldnt know what to do with all of those epic bonus feats from CoT without it in the build.<br><br>I'm sure most people on here will know this, but this character will not be able to wear Heavy Armor until the first level of Blackguard is achieved at character level 8.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 09/13/08 16:58 (GMT) by The_Krit<br><br>That is a mouthful, but it is still better than acronymizing "frequently <b>un</b>asked questions". <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

A fearsome warrior with its rage, wrath, dev crit, smites and high saves! The way you combine BG and CoT to compensate for missing classes is a good and original idea!<br>As you pointed out it lacks knockdown, and I miss it, but I know you can't have everything.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Playable: 1-40,low to mid-magic environments</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->This build will work fine in a mid magic environment.The self buffing of the strength will also be great in a low magic setting <br>But I will still not recommend the build as is in a low magic setting. The reason is that you have no ways of self buffing charisma. Cha 20 gives a +5 modifier for 5 rounds with the divine might/shield feats. That means they are not practical to use in fight, stopping to buff up every 5th round. <br>You want all the charisma boosting items you can get. In a mid magic setting it should be possible to collect enough items to cap cha at 32 with a +11 modifier. Then these feats start to be worth it!<br><br>If you want to activate both DM and DS before fights on a regular basis you may also want extra turning, but that takes a paladin or cleric, unless you get it on an item.<br><br>Bottom line: I like the build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Honestly, I think life is too short for people to be fretting about alignment shifts.  While I think Pally/BGs are a bit egregious, I think there should be room for other type alignment shifts less egregious, like your reformed bad guys, or your born-again bastards.  Characters in fiction and literature are ripe with such stories, and it is the growth and development of such characters that makes it worthwhile to read/watch.  And that works both ways-- watching the hero de-evolve into something darker and menacing, when he throws away his ideals and hallmarks of good-guy-ism (Dark Knight anyone?), or the young bloodthirsty warmonger who, after years of weary war and battle, finds his soul in the eyes of one of his victims, a child perhaps, and the light inside him suddenly "turns on."  <br><br>I'm not for the exploitation posed by alignment shifts, but I think alignment shifts in general are a reflection of life itself, brought about by experience, environment, and love itself.  DMs should allow for such changes, and not be consigned to an "all or nothing" approach.  Ironically, it is the RP servers where the alignment nazis are most vigilant.  I enjoy playing the tormented character, the haunted soul, even in those characters where an alignment shift won't bring you anything but, well, an alignment shift (plain fighter, e.g).  If somebody can't find a place where such things are accepted, well, you should just come sit beside me.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 09/26/08 13:37</span></i></p>
