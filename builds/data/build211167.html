<b>The Preying Mantis</b>: Ranger11/Monk10/WeaponMaster19<br><br>First, let me say that this is not a terribly inspired build.  On the contrary, there are so many 10APR Monk-Kama builds out there, I almost feel embarrased to post this.  Yet I will, and do so without any fanfare or fanfiction.  This character will be the first and only Ranger/Monk/WeaponMaster in the Guild, and looking back I can see why.  In nearly every case of a Kama-wielding WeaponMaster-Monk, a Fighter class is used.  Reasons why are obvious: feats granted and WS/EWS.  With a possible 10 attacks per round, +6damage adds up very quickly.  I think in high-magic environments, this is absolutely warranted.  However, in low magic environments, and even to some extent mid-magic environs, it is not as necessary.  Therefore, the Ranger has a few things to offer, especially initially in pre-epic, but also after: <br> <br>The Ranger provides for an AC Buff with Cat's Grace.<br>  <br>He also supports the build with Set Traps skill of 25-- enough to lay all Deadly Traps.<br><br>His Animal Companion helps to see him through those rocky pre-epic levels.<br><br>He can stealth better than the Fighter version because of A. Trackless Step, B. Camoflauge, and C. One With Land.<br><br>Has built in Ultravision (1st lvl Ranger spell) to defend againt sneak/death attacks (acquired Lvl5)<br><br>Receives more skill points<br><br>Doesn't have to set his Dex to 15<br><br>Ranger/Monk Synergy--all Wisdom enhancements grant both AC and Ranger spell slots.<br><br>One will also notice the harmonious balance created with start-up ability scores.  It allows for the best  possible bonuses from each stat without having to bankrupt your soul in the process.  AC seems a little low, but at first level you definitely want to wear armor until some of those Monk bonuses start to kick in.  He can still achieve a significantly high AC naked, so look for those items that will grant you Wisdom and Dex bonuses.  <br><br>I should mention a word about Spring Attack: sometimes one forgets how useful this feat is, but when you are running around hasted with Monk speed, and you are trying to slip your way through the enemy to get to the boss, it is a wonderful thing to not have attacks of opportunity on your character.  Let me reiterate: it is a <i>wondeful thing.</i> If only Spring Attack were a Rogue bonus feat.....sigh.<br><br>Other than that, he gets decent saving throws, a ton of attacks per round, good AC, good skill set, minor Ranger buffs and Traps, has some decent RP value due to Ranger/Monk combo, is decent on Hit Points, and sports a dualwield AB that's higher than most singlewield ABs.  <br><br>The only Drawbacks are that he can't raise his AB other than by quaffing potions, or using strength-enhancing items or magic weapons.  However, with a 45Dualwield AB, he doesn't need to go very far.  Low to Mid magic enviroments would probably be best.  Also, I didn't allow him to pick up Improved Knockdown until Lvl23.  I think it's just fine to take Monk5 and 6 pre-epic instead of WM, and obtain it much earlier(more like Lvl17 which, admittedly, is still along wait).  Just remember that he doesn't have to rely on generating Sneaks, so IKD won't be as sorely needed as it is by other classes.<br><br><b>PvM, Playable 1-40</b><br><br><b>Ranger11/Monk10/WeaponMaster19</b><br>Human, Lawful/Something<br><br>Str14(30)<br>Int14<br>Wis14<br>Dex14<br>Con14<br>Chr8<br><br>1 Ranger1, Dodge, Mobility, Favored Enemy<br>2 Monk1, (Cleave)<br>3 Ranger2, Weapon Focus: Kama<br>4 Ranger3, Str15<br>5 Ranger4, Favored Enemy, (1st Ranger Spell)<br>6 Ranger5, Expertise<br>7 Monk2<br>8 Ranger6, Str16, (Animal Companion)<br>9 Ranger7, Spring Attack<br>10 Ranger8<br>11 Ranger9<br>12 Monk3, Whirlwind Attack, Str17<br>13 WeaponMaster1<br>14 WeaponMaster2<br>15 WeaponMaster3, Improved Critical: Kama<br>16 WeaponMaster4, Str18<br>17 Monk4<br>18 WeaponMaster5, Blindfighting<br>19 WeaponMaster6<br>20 WeaponMaster7, Str19<br>21 Ranger10, EWF: Kama, Great Str I<br>22 Monk5<br>23 Monk6, (Improved Knockdown)<br>24 Ranger11, Great Str II, Str22<br>25 WeaponMaster8<br>26 WeaponMaster9<br>27 Monk7, Great Str III<br>28 WeaponMaster10, Str 24<br>29 WeaponMaster11<br>30 WeaponMaster12, Great Str IV<br>31 WeaponMaster13, Armor Skin<br>32 Monk8, Str26<br>33 WeaponMaster14, Great Str V<br>34 WeaponMaster15<br>35 Weapon Master16, Epic Prowess<br>36 WeaponMaster17, Great Str VI, Str29<br>37 Monk9, (Improved Evasion)<br>38 WeaponMaster18<br>39 WeaponMaster19, Toughness, Epic Toughness<br>40 Monk10, Str30<br><br>AB: 47<br><b>Dualwielding Kamas</b>: 45/42/39/36/33/30/45/42 (17-20/x3)<br>AC: 26(27)(32)<br>Hit Points: 520<br><br><b>Saves</b><br>Fort: 24 (28) <br>Will: 21 (25) <br>Reflex: 24(28)<br><br><b>Skills</b><br>Hide: 43<br>Move Silently: 43<br>Tumble: 40<br>Discipline: 43<br>Set Traps: 25<br>Spellcraft: 18<br>Listen: 25<br>Heal: 1<br>Disable Traps: 1<br><br><br><b>Final Note</b>: his title, <i>The Preying Mantis</i>, has meanings threefold: 1. his forest flavor and Ranger heritage, 2. it's an old Martial Art style, and 3. anybody coming at you with a Kama in each hand has a Mantis look about them, especially females!<br><br><b>Final, final note</b>: Female Mantises are known to rip/bite the heads off of males after mating.<br><br><b>Addendum</b>: the producers of this build wish to note that the above "final, final note" is in reference to bugs, not people.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/12/07 16:02</span></i></p>

Nice build Grizz and good AB (as Kal noted). I thik you went a bit overboard on the apology, but that's understandable, seeing as you're using that detestable Monk class! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>One note: Spring Attack can definitely be useful, but it's rendered completely redundant once your modified Tumble reaches 14+, which (I'd assume) would be by level 12 (Monk level 3) of this build. This also makes it a completely unnecessary feat for almost all Rogue builds, btw (not many Rogue builds without high Tumble). Of course, it's a prereq for WM, so you need it anyway.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
