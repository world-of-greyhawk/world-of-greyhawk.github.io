<script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "178675", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Arcane Trebuchet (Wizard 40) by Mithdradates</a><br><br><b>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****     ***</b><br><br>I composed this list over the past week as a request for an outline of what spells would be useful for a pure wizard or sorcerer.  Because this is written with a high level persective, spells that would be useful at low levels are not included.  Feel free to comment, point out any spells or spell combos I missed or any inaccuracies.<br><br><b>Level 0</b><br><br><i>Light (Evocation)</i>- A great little spell for countering darkness or, cast on a character or item, for providing a light source.<br><i>Resistance (Abjuration)</i>- This spell grants a universal +1 saving throw bonus to all save for 2 minutes.<br><br><b>Level 1</b><br><br><i>Charm Person (Enchantment)</i>- This spell can stop a hostile opponent from attacking you and your party. It is easily blocked by anything that blocks mind spells, but for a neutral mage in a setting where items that confer immunity to mind spells are rare this spell works like a charm (pun fully intended).  The DC may seem low, but you can couple this with the level 5 spell-mind fog to lower an opponents will save by 10.<br><i>Grease (Conjuration)</i>-  This spell will at least slow all opponents in the area of effect.  Against opponents with low reflex saves (STR based fighters this means you) it will knock them down, effectively taking them out of the fight.<br><i>Horizikaul's Boom (Evocation)</i>- This spell with inflict 5D4 sonic damage, and on a failed will save will deafen a target.  Use mind fog to soften up a target first.<br><i>Identify (Divination)</i>- For those times when a maxed out lore skill isn't good enough to indentify an item.  Only memorize this spell as needed<br><i>Mage Armor (Conjuration)</i>- This is at least good for a +1 to dodge AC.  You can also cast it on your allies.  This spell can be good in a low magic setting.<br><i>Magic Missile (Evocation)</i>-  The most damaging level 1 spell (and probably the most over-hyped).  The magic damage is seldom resisted and can be a useful mode of attack for when nothing else is working.  It is trumped by Isaac's Lesser Missile Storm and Isaac's Greater Missile Storm.<br><i>Protection from Alignment (Abjuration)</i>- The +2 deflection bonus isn't that useful (maybe for your allies/familiar/summons), but a +2 to all saving throws and immunity to mind spells against a chosen alignment that lasts for 1 hour per level.  That's bloody amazing!<br><i>Ray of Enfeeblement (Necromancy)</i>- This spell probably won't do anything against a fighter unless you are focused in necromancy, but against low fortitude save characters like a wizard or rogue it can be effective.  Watch as they go from zipping around comfortably, to heavily encumbered.<br><i>Shield (Abjuration)</i>-  This spell gives you a +4 deflection AC bonus, which is pretty handy.  The great thing about this spell is that it also renders you immune to: Firebrands, Flame Arrows, Isaac's Lesser Missile Storm, Isaac's Greater Missile Storm, Magic Missiles, Manticore Spikes, Quilfires, and any other missile spells or creature effects.<br><i>True Strike (Divination)</i>- This spell grants a +20 AB bonus for 9 seconds.  So, for one round (two, if hasted) you can hit your target very well. If you can land a knockdown in that turn, you can probably extend your hitting streak for three rounds.  This spell isn't useful for a pure mage, but it's a must have for spellswords.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 11/27/05 23:35</span></i></p>

<b>Level 2</b><br><br><i>Bull's Strength (Transmutation)</i>- 1D4+1 bonus to strength that lasts 1 hour per level. Good for carrying extra loot, or buffing your fellow party members/summons/familiar.<br><i>Cat's Grace (Transmutation)</i>- 1D4+1 bonus to dexterity that lasts 1 hour per level.  Good for increasing the AC/Reflex saves of yourself or your allies.<br><i>Cloud of Bewilderment (Evocation)</i>- This spell will stun and blind your opponents if they fail a fortitude save.  For a wizard with an evocation focus this is a great way to stop a group of opponents from advancing against you an your allies.<br><i>Combust (Evocation)</i>- This spell inflicts 2D6+10 points of fire damage with no save, then until your opponent makes a reflex save they continue to take 1D6 points of fire damage each round.  For a low reflex save character that can only make a reflex save on a twenty, there is a 50% chance it will take the character at least 14 rounds to get that 20.  That is alot of potential damage from a level 2 spell.<br><i>Darkness (Evocation)</i>- Effectively renders everyone invisible to everyone else in the area of effect.  This spell should be coupled with ultravision.  They say in the land of the blind the one eyed man is king, and with ultravision you get to keep both of your eyes.<br><i>Death Armor (Necromancy)</i>- Anyone who hits your mage takes 1D4+5 points of magical damage.  This spell should be coupled with damage reduction spells (like premonition or epic warding) and other damage shield spells (like elemental shield and mestil's acid sheath.)<br><i>Eagle's Splendor (Transmutation)</i>- 1D4+1 bonus to charisma that lasts 1 hour per level.  Only useful if you are a sorcerer, have CoT or paladin levels, or someone in your party fills those criteria.<br><i>Endurance (Transmutation)</i>-1D4+1 bonus to constitution that lasts 1 hour per level.  At level 40 this is good for an extra 40 to 80 hitpoints and a +1 or +2 to fortitude saves.<br><i>Flame Weapon (Evocation)</i>- You can enchant a weapon to do an extra 1D4+10 points of fire damage per hit.  A great spell if you are a spellsword or you have a fighter in your party.  Also good for killing trolls, if you are playing in an environment where trolls have been modified to require fire damage for death.<br><i>Fox's Cunning (Transmutation)</i>- 1D4+1 bonus to intelligence that lasts 1 hour per level.  If you are a wizard this is a great way to boost your spell DCs. <br><i>Gedlee's Electric Loop (Evocation)</i>- This spell will do 5D4 points of damage to all creatures in the area of effect (watch your allies).  They can make a reflex save for half, but if they fail that save and then fail a will save they are stunned for 1 round.  Many fighters have both low reflex and will saves.  Against opponents who only have low reflex saves, you can use mind fog to lower their will saves.  If you are hasted, you can get off two spells while your opponents are stunned.  You can do quite a few things with two spells.<br><i>Ghoul Touch (Necromancy)</i>  More of a spell for spellswords than pure mages, If you make a touch attack an opponent has to make a fortitude save or be stunned for 1D6+2 rounds (good against rogues).  Affected creatures emit a miasma that negatively effects creatures in a 5 foot radius.<br><i>Invisibility (Illusion)</i> Always useful to be able to get away unaffected of hide a party member so he can get the drop on a tough opponent.<br><i>Knock (Transmuation)</i> A mage's lockpicks.  Only useful if you don't have a rogue in your party.<br><i>Tasha's Hideous Laughter (Enchantment)</i>  If your opponent fills a will save, he is knocked down for 1D3 rounds.  The descriptor claims that this is not a mind spell, but it is blocked by immunity to mind spell items (Not sure if this is a bug or not).  Against opponents who are not immune to mind spells this spell can be very effective, particularly if you have a rogue in your party who can sneak attack the immobilized target.  <br><i>Ultravision (Transmutation)</i> The ability to see in magical darkness. Always handy, particularly if coupled with the spell darkness.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 02/14/05 05:46</span></i></p>

<b>Level 3</b><br><br><i>Clarity (Abjuration)</i>- Protection from mind spells. It only lasts one turn but it's a level 3 spell.  This spell is superseeded by lesser mind blank, but I've included it because it's a useful spell for bards (who can't cast lesser mind blank).<br><i>Displacement (Illusion)</i>- 50% concealment, the same at improved invisibility but at one spell level lower.<br><i>Find Traps (Divination)</i>- Find and disarm all traps in the vicinity of the caster.  If you don't have a rogue in your party, this is a great spell to keep memorized.<br><i>Flame Arrow (Conjuration)</i>- 4D6*floor(Caster Level/4).  This spell is uncapped, so a level 40 mage would fire 10 missiles that each do 4D6 points of fire damage.  Also each missile is considered a different spell so this spell is great for busting up spell mantles.<br><i>Greater Magic Weapon (Transmutation)</i>-  A great spell for spellswords or mages who have a fighter in their party on low magic worlds.  Turn their mundane weapon into a +5 weapon for level hours.<br><i>Gust of Wind (Evocation)</i>- More useful for its ability to dispel area of effect spells, rather than knocking everyone down.  Probably only worth memorizing if you expect a large number of these spells to be cast.<br><i>Haste (Transmutation)</i>- Quicken all your spells, get an extra attack, increase your movement rate and get a +4 to your dodge AC.  Probably the best level 3 spell and a great buffing spell for your party memebers, though mass haste is more convenient in a party setting.<br><i>Hold Person (Enchantment)</i>- A character that fails a will save is paralyzed.  Works well if coupled with mind fog.  Watch out for protection from mind spells (from the spell discriptor this is not a mind spell so either the discriptor is incorrect or this is a bug) and freedom of movement, however.<br><i>Keen Edge (Transmutation)</i>- Adds the keen item property to any slashing weapon.  A buffing spell for spellswords and mages who have fighters in their parties.<br><i>Lightning Bolt (Evocation)</i>- I like this spell because you have directional control over which targets get hit by it.  Plus it will do 10D6 points of electrical damage, which is seldom resisted.<br><i>Magic Circle Against Alignment (Abjuration)</i>- This spell casts Protection from Alignment on all allies within 10 feet.  A good spell for a party mage.<br><i>Mestil's Acid Breath (Conjuration)</i>- Talk about halitosis!  A spell that lets you breath forth a 10D6 cone of acid.  Acid damage is rarely resisted and you have good directional control to avoid hitting your allies.<br><i>Negative Energy Burst (Necromancy)</i>-  Watch out for this spell if you are in a party  because it affects everyone.  It will deal 1D8+caster level of negative energy damage (they can make a will save to half damage).  It will also decrease the target's strength by 1 for every four caster levels.  The really nice thing about this spell is, that it has the opposite effect on undead.  If you summon an undead and cast this spell it will increase its strength and heal it.  Really nice if you have a Risen Lord shifter in your party.<br><i>Slow (Transmutation)</i>- You shouldn't cast this spell if you are in a party, but it will reduce the number of attacks of everyone in the area of effect by 1 and decrease their movement rates by 50% if they fail a will save.  Nice if coupled with mind fog.<br><i>Stinking Cloud (Conjuration)</i>- Creatures that fail an fortitude save are dazed.  Probably won't work on fighters, but it can work on rogues and other mages.<br><i>Vampiric Touch (Necromancy)</i>- On a successful touch attack, this spell will inflict 10D6 points of negative damage on an opponent and heal the same for the caster.  A nice spell for a spellsword.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

<b>Level 4</b><br><br><i>Charm Monster(Enchantment)</i>- If your opponent isn't immune to mind spells, this spell can change it from hostile to neutral.  If your party is being overrun by enemies, this can buy you some breathing room.  Like all mind spells, it works well if coupled with mind fog.<br><i>Confusion (Enchantment)</i>- This spell afflicts enemies in the area of effect with confusion if they fail a will save.  It is a mind spell, so only use it in settings where immunity to mind spells is rare.  It works well with mind fog.  This is also a dangerous spell and affected creatures may attack a random target, that target may be you.<br><i>Elemental Shield (Evocation)</i>-  This spell will give 50% resistance to cold and fire damage and inflict 1D6+caster level damage (uncapped) to anyone who attacks you.  A great spell when coupled with death armor, mestil's acid sheath and damage reduction spells.<br><i>Fear (Necromancy)</i>- This spell will afflict all enemies in the area of effect with fear, which will most likely cause them to flee.  Sometimes they do attack instead.  Works well with mind-fog but watch out for immunity to mind spells and paladins.<br><i>Ice Storm (Evocation)</i>- This spell will inflict 3D6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2D6+(caster level/3)D6 points of cold damage on all targets in the area of effect with no saving throw.  Watch this spell around party members, but it works great against opponents with improved evasion.<br><i>Improved Invisibility (Illusion)</i>- Invisibility until you attack and 50% concealment. A great defensive spell for yourself and party members.<br><i>Isaac's Lesser Missile Storm (Evocation)</i>- Not very useful against multiple opponents but against single opponents this spell will do upto 10D6 points of magic damage.  There is no saving throw and magic damage is seldom resisted.  This spell is countered by the level 1 spell shield.<br><i>Lesser Spell Breach (Abjuration)</i>- Removes two spell defences and lowers an opponents SR by 3.  Unlike the Dispel Magics, there is no resistance to the breach spells.<br><i>Phantasmal Killer (Illusion)</i>- If the opponent fails a will save and a fortitude save he dies, if he just fails the fortitude save he takes 3D6 points of damage.  If he fails the will save he is unaffected.  Mind fog and a good DC will make the will save moot, leaving the fortitude save as the barrier to death.<br><i>Polymorph Self (Transmutation)</i>- If you are wounded you can turn into a troll to heal some damage.<br><i>Remove Blindness/Deafness (Divination)</i>- I wouldn't keep this memorized unless I expect to need it, but if you don't have a cleric this spell can be useful for healing party members or yourself (Blindness/Deafness will induce spell casting failure).<br><i>Remove Curse (Divination)</i>- Nice to have in your grimoire.  If you or any of your party members are cursed you can use this spell to remove it.  Only memorize as needed.<br><i>Stoneskin (Abjuration)</i>- 10/+5 damage reduction may not be great for you, but you can cast this spell on your allies.  A good buff for allies and summons.<br><i>Wall of Fire (Evocation)</i>- 4D6 points of fire damage with a reflex save for half may not sound like a very good spell but, if you paralyze a target and then cast this spell on top of it, you can do a ton of damage.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

<b>Level 5</b><br><br><i>Ball Lightning (Evocation)</i>- 15D6 points of electrical damage against a single target.  They get a reflex save for half, but it's pretty good poke.<br><i>Bigby's Interposing Hand (Evocation)</i>- Without a save a target gets a +10 penalty to attack.  A great spell for taking that bruiser that's ripping through your party out of the fight.<br><i>Cloudkill (Conjuration)</i>- 1D10 points of acid damage against all creatures in the area of effect.  This spell should be coupled with paralysis spells that force an opponent to sit there and take the damage for the duration of the spell.<br><i>Cone of Cold (Evocation)</i>- 15D6 points of cold damage against any targets in the area of effect, with a reflex save for half.  The cone shape allows you deploy this spell while minimizing the risk of hitting an ally.<br><i>Dismissal (Abjuration)</i>-  If the summoned allies of an enemy spell caster fail a will save they are unsummoned.  You probably won't need this against most summons, but it works great against Black Blades of Disaster.<br><i>Dominate Person (Enchantment)</i>- If your opponent is immune to mind spells this spell can be truly devastating.  Not only does your opposition lose a warrior, that warrior now joins your side.  Works well coupled with mind fog.<br><i>Energy Buffer (Abjuration)</i>- This spell will absorb up to 40 points of element damage and vanish once 60 points of damage of a specific elemental type is dealt.  Good for absorbing damage from weapons with elemental damage.  Against spells, you're better off with the globes and mantles.<br><i>Feeblemind (Divination)</i>- If an enemy wizard does not have immunity to mind spells, you can give him the IQ of a turnip.  You should couple this spell with mind fog as most wizards have good will saves.<br><i>Firebrand (Evocation)</i>- Bolts of fire stream out to all of the enemies of the caster (up to caster level) doing up to 15D6 of fire damage with a reflex save for half.  This may sound good, but beware, it will often strike enemies off screen and draw them towards you, giving you a tougher fight than you had before.<br><i>Hold Monster (Enchantment)</i>- If an enemy monster fails a will save he is paralysed for the duration of the spell.  Again, according to the descriptors for this spell it is not a mind spell but immunity to mind spells will block its effects.  Works well when coupled with mind fog.<br><i>Lesser Mind Blank (Abjuration)</i>- This spell will confer immunity to mind spells to the target for a number of minutes equal to the caster level. Invaluable.<br><i>Lesser Spell Mantle (Abjuration)</i>-  The higher level versions of this spell are more effective, but if you are anticipating a mage duel it's a good idea to memorize a few of these.<br><i>Mestil's Acid Sheath (Conjuration)</i>- The ultimate in damage shield spells.  Anyone who damages you takes 1D6 plus twice your caster level in damage.  Coupled with damage reduction this spell is truly devastating.  This spell should also be coupled with death armor and elemental shield.<br><i>Mind Fog (Enchantment)</i>  All creatures in the fog that fail a will save have their will saves reduced by 10, the effect lasts 2D6 rounds once they leave.  Great for softening up targets for enchantments.  An invaluable spell for enchanters.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

<b>Level 6</b><br><br><i>Acid Fog (Conjuration)</i>- When creatures enter the fog they take 4D6 points of acid damage, while in the fog they take 2D6 points of acid damage per round.  If they fail a fortitude save while in the fog they have their movement rates reduced by 50%.  Works well if coupled with paralysis spells.<br><i>Bigby's Forceful Hand (Evocation)</i>- A target that gets hit by this spell is knocked down for caster level rounds.  To resist this spell the opponent rolls 1D20 adds his strength modifier and size modifer and compares that to the Caster's roll of 1D20+14, if he has a higher total he resists the spell.  Unless your opponent has a 38 or higher strength, the odds are in the caster's favor.  A great spell.<br><i>Chain Lightning (Evocation)</i>- This spell does up to 20D6 points of electrical damage to an opponent and half that amount to all the opponents surrounding it.  It only targets enemies, so this is a great spell for damaging multiple opponents in a party setting.  Unfortunately there is a reflex save for 1/2 damage so it can be evaded.<br><i>Flesh to Stone (Transumation)</i>-  Turns an opponent into a statue if he fails a fortitude save.  The nice thing about this spell is that it is not a death spell, so immunity to death magic will not help.<br><i>Globe of Invulnerability (Abjuration)</i>- Renders a caster immune to all spells of 4th level or lower.  Always handy.<br><i>Greater Spell Breach (Abjuration)</i>- This spell will remove 4 defences from an enemy mage without any resistance and lower the caster's spell resistance by 5.<br><i>Greater Stoneskin (Transmutation)</i>- 20/+5 damage reduction which will absorb upto 150 points of damage.  A good back up to premonition.<br><i>Isaac's Greater Missile Storm (Evocation)</i>- Not a good spell if you are being swarmed by enemies, but it is very damaging against a single opponent.  Under those circumstances this spell will hit a target with upto 20 missiles that each do 2D6 points of magic damage.<br><i>Mass Haste (Enchantment)</i>- All of your allies reap the benefits of haste (1 extra attack per turn, all of their spells quickened, +50% to their movement rate, +4 to dodge AC).  If you have many party members you are probably better off memorizing this spell rather than 3 or 4 hastes.<br><i>Stone to Flesh (Transmutation)</i>- A good spell to have in your grimoire.  If a party member gets petrified or you expect enemies to use petrification, you can memorize this spell and use it to free them.  For a wizard, this spell should be in your grimoire and used as needed. Probably not worth it for a sorcerer unless your mod involves journeying through the vale of cockatrices to the valley of basilisks where you will assault the fortress of the medusae.<br><i>Tenser's Transformation (Transmutation)</i>- You will be turned into a warrior with a longsword.  You will have 10+2D4 strength, dexterity and constitution, gain +4 natural armor bonus, get +5 to your fortitude save a warrior AB and an extra 1D6 hit points per caster level.  There are two times when this spell can be handy: one is if you a longsword wielding spellsword on a no magic world (you'll get a huge AB boost, a fortitude boost and you can still use devastating critical longsword). The other time is if you paralyse a high hit point opponent and you need to pound on him physically to kill him.  It's a spell of dubious value, but one you may find valuable in certain settings.<br><i>True Seeing (Divination)</i>- This spell is a must have in any mage's grimoire.  For 1 minute per caster level you can see all hidden opponents, this is great for spotting rogues and fighting shadow dancers.  You can also cast this on the scouts of your party.<br><i>Undeath to Death (Necromancy)</i>-  This spell will kill upto 20D4 hit dice worth of undead if they fail a will save.  This spell works well with mind fog and is a good example of one of the advantages of wizards over sorcerers.  A sorcerer probably could not afford to have this spell in his grimoire, the wizard can on the other hand and if he suspects undead, can fill his level 6 spell slots with this spell.  With this spell a mage can truly slaughter the undead.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

<b>Level 7</b><br><br><i>Banishment (Abjuration)</i>- Simmilar to dismissal, this spell will destroy up to twice caster level hit dice of summoned creatures and outsiders.  Think of this spell as undeath to death for outsider.  Useful, if you are in an outsider rich setting.<br><i>Bigby's Grasping Hand (Evocation)</i>-  This spell will hold an opponent for 1 round per level.  First, the caster rolls 1D20 and adds his casting attribute modifier (INT modifier for wizard, CHA modifier for sorcerer) +his caster level+9.  If this total is higher than the target's AC, the Caster makes a grapple check (1D20+casting attribute modifier+caster level+14) and compares this to the target opposition roll (1D20+BAB+STR bonus+size modifier).  If the Caster's roll is greater than or equal to the target's roll, the target is held for the duraction of the spell.  A very useful spell for taking an opponent out of a fight.<br><i>Control Undead (Necromancy)</i>- If a target undead with up to twice caster level worth of hit dice fails a saving throw, he is dominated by the caster.  This spell can be coupled with mind fog and can be a great way of getting a powerful ally.<br><i>Delayed Blast Fireball (Evocation)</i>-  This spell allows a wizard to lay a trap of mine a passage way with a fireball that will do up to 20D6 worth of damage.  This is a handy way to discourage pursuit, although there is a reflex save for half damage so it can be evaded.<br><i>Finger of Death (Necromancy)</i>- The target must make a fortitude save or die.  If he makes the save he takes 3D6 +caster level worth of negative damage.  This spell probably will not kill a fighter or barbarian, but it will drop the rogue that's evading everything else.<br><i>Prismatic Spray (Evocation)</i>- An upredictable but dangerous spell.  The caster creates a multicoloured cone and all creatures within the cone will be subject to 1 or 2 (12.5% chance) of the following effects:  20 points of fire damage (reflex save for half), 40 points of acid damage (reflex save for half), 80 points of electrical damage (reflex save for half), Bebilith poison (no save), Paralysis (fortitude save to negate), Confusion (will save to negate, script doesn't check for immunity mind spells), Death (will save to negate, doesn't check for immunity death magic).  A risky spell, but it could instantly kill and confuse an opponent and with a will save to avoid death it can work against high fortitude save opponents.  No guts, no glory.<br><i>Protection from Spells (Enchantment)</i>- A great party buffing spell, up to caster level/4 allies gain a +8 to all saves vs. spells.  Nice to have in your grimoire.<br><i>Shadow Shield (Illusion)</i>- One of the best mage protection spells, for one minute per level the caster gains a +5 natural AC bonus, 10/+3 damage reduction, immunity to death magic, immunity to negative energy effects and immunity to necromancy spells.  A must have for wizards and sorcerers.<br><i>Spell Mantle (Abjuration)</i>- This spell will absorb up to 1D8+8 spell levels of spells cast against the caster.  It will not last very long, but it can make a difference in a mage duel.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

<b>Level 8</b><br><br><i>Bigby's Clenched Fist (Evocation)</i>- Every round for the duration of the spell: The caster makes a roll of 1D20+ casting ability modifier (INT or CHA)+ caster level + 10 and compares this to the target's AC.  If the caster's total is greater than or equal to the target's AC the spell hits and the target takes 1D8+11 points of damage.  If the target then fails a fortitude save he is stunned for the duration of the round.  This is probably the weakest of the Bigby's spells, but it works well on low fortitude save opponents.<br><i>Greater Sanctuary (Transmutation)</i>-  This spell makes the caster completely ethereal for the duration of the spell.  Effectively immune to all damage.  The spell is cancelled by any hostile action.  This spell is great for retreating or casting buffs if you have been surprised or dispelled.  I always like to keep a silent greater sanctuary just in case.  There have been cases of this spell malfunctioning and casting regular sanctuary instead or of opponents still damaging the caster after this spell has been cast (don't wait until the eleventh hour to cast it) hopefully these bugs will be fixed soon.<br><i>Horrid Wilting (Necromancy)</i>- Watch your allies on this one, all creatures in the area of effect take up to 25D8 points of magical energy damage with a fortitude save for half.  This spell will not affect constructs or undead.  For it's ability to hit characters with evasion and its massive damage this spell is a must have.<br><i>Incendiary Cloud (Evocation)</i>-  This spell lasts one round per caster level and each round that a creature is within the cloud they take 4D6 points of fire damage with a reflex save for half.  This spell works wonders against paralysed targets.<br><i>Mass Blindness/Deafness (Illusion)</i>- All enemies within a 10ft radius are rendered blind and deaf for one round per caster level.  There is a fortitude save to negate.  This spell can be helpful in a party setting, it also has a good chance of working against enemy spell casters.<br><i>Mass Charm (Enchantment)</i>- If your enemies are not immune to mind spells this spell will change them from hostile to neutral if they fail a will save.  This spell can be a real life saver, you can go from being swarmed, to being able to focus all your attention on one opponent at a time.  You can couple this spell with mind fog if needs be.<br><i>Mind Blank (Abjuration)</i>- This spell will confer immunity to mind spells on yourself and all your allies for one minute per caster level.  It will also cancel all mind effects.  A must have for any party mage.<br><i>Premonition (Divination)</i>- 30/+5 damage reduction that absorbs up to 10 points of damage per caster level.  the second best damage reduction spell (Epic Warding being the best).  A must have for all mages.<br><i>Sunburst (Evocation)</i>-  This spell will inflict up to 25D6 points of divine damage to undead and 6D6 of divine damage against other opponents, also all opponents must make a reflex saving throw or be destroyed.  Vampires will be destroyed if they fail their saving throw.  A great spell to have in your grimoire, a wizard can memorize whenever he expects to fight undead.  Probably not worth it for a sorcerer.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

<b>Level 9</b><br><br><i>Bigby's Crushing Hand (Evocation)</i>- The caster attempts to grapple the target (1D20 +Casting Ability Modifier (INT or CHA)+Caster Level+11 &gt;= target's AC).  If successful, the target attempts to resist the hand [(1D20+size modifer+BAB+STR modifier) vs. (1D20+Casting Ability Modifier, Caster Level +16)], the target's roll beats the caster's roll he is unaffected, otherwise he is held for the duration of the spell and takes 2D6+12 points of damage each round for the duration of the spell.  Nasty.<br><i>Black Blade of Disaster (Conjuration)</i>- The character cannot cast any spell while this spell is up (so cast greater sanctuary before you cast this spell).  It summons a +5 Greatsword that does 2D6 slashing damage, 1D12 piercing damage, has the 1D12 massive critical property and all opponents hit by the weapon must make a fortitude save or die.  To make it even nastier the weapon is completely immune to damage.  Great for taking out opponents with spell resistance, even if you have to wait for them to autofail their fortitude save on a 1.<br><i>Dominate Monster (Enchantment)</i>- If an enemy monster is not immune to mind spells, you can take control of it if it fails a will save.  You can get some pretty nasty monsters as underlings under this spell.  Since your opposition is typically stronger than your summons this is a great spell.<br><i>Mordenkainen's Disjunction (Abjuration)</i>- Against a single target, this spell will attempt to remove all magical effects (with a dispel check of 1D20 + caster level (up to 20) against a DC of 11+plus the effect's caster level), it will also remove 6 magical defences and lower the target's spell resistance by 10.  Against a group of targets, it will attempt to remove 2 magical effects (with a dispel check of 1D20 + caster level (up to 20) against a DC of 11+plus the effect's caster level), remove two spell protections and lower the target's spell resistance by 10.  A must have for any spell caster.<br><i>Shapechange (Transmutation)</i>- The most useful ability is the ability to turn into an Iron golem (as this wil confer immunity to critical hits).  The red dragon form can also be fun if you are low on spells and need to kill an immobilized target with a lot of HP.  A very useful spell.<br><i>Timestop (Transmutation)</i>- The quintessential mage spell.  This spell alone is the reason some people feel that mages are overpowered.  Time will stop for every one but the caster for 9 seconds.  Hasted, you can cast 3 spell in that time or, if you're a spell sword, kill a bunch of enemies with devastating critical.<br><i>Wail of the Banshee (Necromancy)</i>- All creatures in the area of effect of the spell (the number of creatures not exceeding the caster level) must make a fortitude saving throw or die.  The description says it all.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

<b>Epic Spells</b><br><br><i>Epic Mage Armor</i>-  Only get this spell on no or low magic item servers.  It gives you +5 to armor, deflection, dodge and natural armor. If you have +5 equipment the +5 to dodge is the only bonus you will get.  Still, this spell is the second or third most useful epic spell.<br><i>Epic Warding</i>- If you only get 1 epic spell, this is the spell to get.  50/+20 damage reduction that lasts for 1 round per caster level.  If you are immnune to critical hits, you are virtually invulnerable to melee atacks.<br><i>Greater Ruin</i>- 35D6 points of damage with a fortitude save for half against a single target. No spell resistance.  Good for hurting creatures that are immune to spells, probably the second or third best epic spell. <br><i>Hellball</i>- This spell does 10D6 of acid, fire, electrical and sonic damage to all targets in the area of effect and knocks them down.  Not a bad spell, but there are better ways to spend your feats.<br><i>Mummy Dust</i>- This spell summons a powerful mummy warrior as an ally.  The mummy is immune to critical hits and can take quite a pounding.  Since the dragon knight can be killed by a devastating critical attack, if you need an epic summon this is the one to get.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Then just send the summons into battle as your tank while you stand back shooting Magic Missles, Fireballs, IGLM's, Melf's Acid Arrow etc etc. Every time you can get a better summons spell, take it and repeat the process. Just make sure to leave enough damage spells in your book so that you can finish the battles you start.<br>This is a really good way to keep your wizard alive until the mid-teens because, unless your servers are tweaked, monsters AI will always attack the summons and leave your wizard alone.<br>Of course, there may come a time when the monsters will destroy your summons in a couple of rounds. At this point you must consider new tactics.<br>Try coupling empowered Ice storms and Delayed Blast Fireballs, IGMS and Wilts. Do as much damage as possible before the monsters can reach you, then use a Greater Sanctuary and get the heck outta there. Rest, if you must, and go back to it.<br>This works great on PvM servers.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 02/10/05 17:14:30 (GMT) -- GoVols<br><br>I found the 3 most useful spells, providing you have enough hit points and some small damage immunities (stone skin, or items) on are the extended versions of acid sheath, death armor and elemental shield.

<b>Addendum</b> -Thanks to Althernai for pointing this out.<br><br><b>Level 4</b><br><br><i>Stoneskin (Abjuration)</i>- Will only aborb up to 100 points of damage before the shield fails.<br><br><b>Level 6</b><br><br><i>Ethereal Visage (Illusion)</i>- This spell will confer 25% concealment, immunity to level 2 or lower spells and 20/+3 damage reduction.
