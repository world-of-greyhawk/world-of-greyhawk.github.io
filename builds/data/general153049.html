heya builders!<br><br>I know this probably isn't the right forum to post in. but there a lot of skilled builders/players here so I had to give it a shot since I'm sick and tired of finding my way through the jungle of bitching PWs out there. I also know that many of you like low/mid magic worlds, which is something I just haven't been able to find.<br>so what I want is:<br>1. low/mid magic items<br>2. mid speed leveling<br>3. no class crippling (like disabling epic dodge, or gimping all mage spells) in fact I don't want any rule changes at all! I think the normal rules work!<br>4. max lvl 40<br>5. preferrably no RP, but there's nothing wrong with being polite to ppl.<br><br>please send PM or reply to this post if you know of a PW that you think I would like.<br><br>happy gaming <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
