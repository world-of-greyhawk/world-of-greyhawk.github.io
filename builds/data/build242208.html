18 starting strength is kinda wasteful. If you drop it to 17, you can bump intelligence up to 14, which will help your pathetic skill points a bit, and constitution up to 14, which will buy you 40 more HP<br>_________________<br>CATS!

Lore 43? Listen 30, Spot 31? No spellcraft? <b>No UMD???</b><br>Lore 43 is a waste have a merchant identify your objects. I understand a few ranks in it to save money at lower level, but afterwards it's not worth it. Especially when you have more important skills to pick up. Go either spot <i>or</i> listen, not both, unless you have plenty of skillpoints and can max out both. I'd pick listen. Spellcraft ranks will help your saves. UMD is the single best skill in the game, why aren't you putting points in it? Some trap setting/diarming skills will help too.<br><br>Extra skillpoints <b>always</b> get a use, especially with a build with Rogue. <br><br>About the format: don't put the skill points selection per level in the leveling guide, it messes up everything and makes the build difficult to read. Post it separately, please. Have a look at th eposts of our more experienced fellow guild members to get an idea of what a neat post looks like.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

Pretty decent FTR/Rogue/WM build Meph. I'd also recommend taking a 5th Rogue level and dropping that 11th FTR level.

In general these builds are designed for online PvP environments. In such an environment, you will never find such superpowered items.

Level 9 WM1 would allow for a feat as well as WoC Scythe, I imagine Improved Crit. would have fit there.
