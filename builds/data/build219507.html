You could take away a pre-epic rogue level without lowering your AB. Would hurt the levelability (new word!) and skills but might lead to a more effective build. Build to taste, in other words.

A few things come to mind that you might benefit from and refine on a little.<br><br>First... the rogue at first level for skillpoints is a good idea, but sorcerers have an "ECL adjustment" at low levels that makes them gain exp faster than other characters.  So if you hold off on multiclassing before level 6 (when the ECL adjustment fades away) you will gain more xp per kill early on.<br><br>Second... with 32 or more caster levels you don't need penetration.  You can Disjunction an SR-buffed cleric, while you can't ever land spells on an SR monk anyway, even with 40 caster levels and epic penetration.  Sorcerers are relatively feat-starved and you'll probably benefit more from freeing up these feats unless your server environment has different SR rules.<br><br>You also have greater ruin, which ignores SR, to use in those situations anyway <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I think your cha is too low though, in the end, to use anything but no-save spells.  If it's a PvP build that's not an issue because you'd be using them anyway.  In a PvE build it might hurt.  I would try to shoot for 30 if not 32 or 34 charisma in the final build as a PvE sorcerer.<br><br>Why take weapon focus and epic weapon focus?  You'll only hit things on a 20 anyway and your real damage comes from your spells.  Likewise Blind Fight.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Its sweet, really. But I am no good with caster builds. One thing to note, you say in your build that the PAL and ROG levels pre-epic is there to also help your AB.They don't. You need either 3 ROG or 2 PAL pre epic to get any BAB raise.

Then the next logical thing to do is lose the rogue level.  You would be giving up only 6 skill points (from heal, if you are me) and uncanny dodge.  And some playability early.  That AC from tumble would come in handy, and some UMD at that point would also be useful.
