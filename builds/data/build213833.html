A huge black shape was sat in the throne, his face was almost featureless and his skin was black as pitch. Two horns protruded from the top of his forehead, and his eyes reflected the flames burning around him. In his right hand he held a sceptre that rested across his lap, his left idly rubbed the end of his chin as he gazed in contemplation before him. For this was the Lord of the Damned, holding court in his domain.<br><br>Standing not more than ten metres away was a black rectangular altar; manacles had been fixed into the uppermost face of the block. An unfortunate naked man, covered in welts, burns and bruises had been secured in position on the altar. As he lay there, face down against the blackness, between his sobs of despair and his terror of what he knew to come, he begged for mercy.<br><br>A robed figure knelt before the Lord, praying fervently, their face obscured from view, by the length of hair that hung down both sides of their face. From the shape of the body, it became apparent this was a woman, and as her prayers reached their climax, her body became infused with such power that a visible aura surrounded her. Finally, her prayers finished and she waited for her Lord’s command to continue; yet still she remained kneeling, with her head bowed before him.<br><br>The Lord of the Damned focussed with more seriousness on the proceedings, the ceremony was nearly complete. He gazed down at the woman; a vicious smile lit his lips, his teeth almost glowing, so white they were against his pitch-black skin. Yes, he thought, she is ready. At last, I have a worthy Champion. The lives of men would soon be his and his alone. A rumbling, primeval roar escaped his mouth that echoed across the realm of the damned.<br><br>“Arise, Lily,” he commanded. The figure slowly stood from her obsequious position before him, radiating a serene calmness. Her hair fell back as she did so, revealing a pale complexion and a determined look was upon her face. She knew what lay ahead, what challenges lay before her, and soul revelled in this. She would not fail her master.<br><br>“Yes my Lord” her heart skipped a beat momentarily; this was the moment she craved, the sacrifice of the flesh for her Lord. Bowing low, she stepped backwards a few paces before standing upright once more and turned slowly towards the altar. The sobs of the man persisted even now unaware of the movement around him. <br><br>Lily approached the altar, beginning the opening chants of the ceremony, her hands moving in patterns in the air. She picked a curved, wicked looking blade from the altar blessing it. A fire suddenly leapt from the hilt of it, travelling its length to the point in a moment. The flames licked around the metal, highlighting her cruel smile in their glow. Raising both arms above her she began the final incantation, a circle of fire fell from above all around and slowly drew in towards her. The man on the altar screamed as the droplets of fire hit his skin, burning his skin still further. So hot were the flames that parts of his body began to char and melt onto the block, yet she remained untouched.<br><br>She held the blade almost in parallel to the man, along the length of his body, with the point of the blade poised to cut below the rear of the left hand side of his rib cage. The flames burnt him still further; so close they were to his skin. Suddenly she forced the weapon into the cavity, puncturing the lung, and with such force that the tip emerged from the man’s shoulder, breaking the bone in its travel. Slowly she turned the blade a full circle, carving the organs apart that lay next to it. With a sharp movement the blade was withdrawn, pulling the lung with it. The screams of the man were unending at the pain he experienced, his breath was ragged as the blood rushed into his other, still functioning lung.<br><br>Panting slightly, more from her excitement and passion in this moment than any exertion, she wiped the blade with the flat of her hand, removing the chunks of flesh and skin that remained on it. Again she picked her spot, this time she cut a circle into his back, above the heart. She put the blade down a moment and reached in with her right hand grasping the heart, feeling it pulse between her fingers. Gently but firmly she squeezed it, the man’s body shuddered as she did so. She pulled the heart clear from the body, holding it still beating in her hand, as she did so, the man passed out and fell limp against the altar.<br><br>Turning she presented the heart to her Lord, and slowly approached him. Stopping a few metres away from his feet, she held both hands out in front of her, palms facing upwards, with the man’s heart, slowly pumping, on them. The Lord of the Damned leaned forward and stretched out a long arm, reaching for the heart. His taloned fingers pierced the organ and he raised it towards his mouth, before biting it in half and roaring once more.<br><br>Lily smiled ecstatically, knowing she had performed exceptionally she turned facing the altar once more. Her hands moved as if tracing the patterns of a globe in front of her and a small orb of dark light flew to the victim, still lying there unconscious. As it hit, his remains exploded out in a sphere away from the altar, blood and bone littered the surrounding rocks. Finally she turned once more to face her Lord awaiting his command.<br><br>Her Master sat back in his throne, relaxed once more and pleased with her work. Yet much was to be done. “Lily, my child. Your time has come. Return once more to the land of the living. Begin your work in earnest. Subjugate the living and bring their souls to me.” <br><br>“Yes my Lord, I will carry out your will with pleasure.” Smiling to herself she withdrew. <br><br>I must ready myself, she thought as she walked away. At last a chance to demonstrate her talents to the world. <br><br>“Yes” she said to herself, “the living will perish one by one” imagining the pain and torment she would wreak upon the world. Returning to her quarters, she made ready her equipment, taking particular care with her blade, that same one with which she had performed the sacrifice.<br><br><br>Human -	Female (Chaotic Evil.)

Melee Weapon - Taking Luck of Heroes at first instead of Weapon Proficiency Martial limits your melee weapon choice significantly. This is personal choice, when all is said and done, particularly bearing in mind the increases to saves that area acheivable through the effects of Bard Song and all the Cleric Buffs.<br><br>2. Dev Crit or not - this can be taken, but only at the expense of Epic Prowess (at 36th) or Epic Mage Armor (at 39th).<br><br>3. Armor Skin - 2 points of AC to an already high AC - it's a toss up really, if you really want it then drop a Great Strength, but then your primary stat finishes on an odd number.<br><br>4. Low Charisma bonus without items or buffs to take full advantage of the War Domain Battle Mastery Powers (duration will not be for long unfortunately)<br><br>5. Could drop Great Cleave for Knockdown and also Overwhelming Critical Scimitar if Dev Crit is not to be used.<br><br>Requirements:<br><br>Any items that can enhance Charisma are a must, purely to enhance the duration of Battle Mastery. <br><br>Hope you all enjoy this one. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 09/25/05 16:14</span></i></p>

Glad you liked it. <br><br>Best be remembering that dwarves are in the world of the living too! <br><br>Just realised I neglected to mention that Gender should be Female (of course) and alginment would be best served as Chaotic Evil.

Well here are my list of things for you to think about:<br>1) Knock STR down by 2 and raise INT by 4 for starting stats.  That will give you -1 ab/damage, but the cleric spells tak on extra damage and now you can max taunt to raise your effective ab by 6 (so a net of 5) and you can boost Discipline which is lacking currently.<br>2) Gain another +1 bab (at the cost of some skill points but from above you have plenty) by not taking any bard pre-epic. Currently you are 2 bard(+1bab) and 18 cleric(+13bab) for 14 total bab.  You lose a skill dump at 17 to boost tumble. easy trade I think.<br>3) Since you are not getting Dev Crit, drop Cleave, Gr Cleave, O Crit.  Get either KD/IKD or Exp/IExp + GrWIS to get your wis to an even 20 and gain you a 1st and 5th level spell slots or armor skin as discussed.

Nice build but too evil for me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  Correct me if I'm wrong but undeaths eternal foe doesn't give a plus 4 to AC (well the book doesn't say so and as far as I have tested).

Nice suggestions and taken them on board UnforgettableKnight. <br><br>After some thought the list below are some changes, which do make for a more rounded build:<br><br>STR dropping 2 points at startup to 14, INT raised by 4 points to 14<br><br>Cleric Levels 1 - 20 increases BAB by 1 point, negating the drop in Strength.<br><br>Discipline 43 (50)<br>Taunt 43 (44)<br>6 extra skill points  - either Appraise, Lore, Heal or Listen<br><br>Extra 1st and 5th level Cleric Spell Slot - dropped O. Crit replaced with Grt Wisdom<br><br>Increase of 1 point to Cleric Spell DC (ignoring Spell Level) to 15.<br><br>Fortitude Save increases by 1 point to 22<br>Will Save decreases by 1 point to 27<br>Reflex Save decreases by 3 points to 16 <br><br>Dropped Power Attack, Cleave, Great Cleave - replaced with Blind Fight, KD and IKD<br><br>Considered Luck of Heroes, but still undecided on the pros/ cons.<br><br>Expertise/ Imp Expertise are not really worth it IMO as the build already a high enough AC anyway, particularly when it is deactivated if you cast a spell or similar.<br><br>Considered leaving Power Attack and Imp Power Attack, but not worth two feats really<br><br>Generally though, the overall effect is good. The only cons are really with the drop in both Will and Reflex saves.<br><br>Need some testing on both I think. I'll let you know the results.

I am not completely sure, but I think that the AC calculations are:<br><br>10 Base<br>10 Pale Master<br>8 Tumble<br>8 Fullplate (mundane)<br>5 Bonus (Magic Vestments Plate)<br>3 Tower shield (mundane)<br>5 Bonus (Magic Vestment Shield)<br>1 Dexterity Modifier (Cat's Grace)<br>5 Armor Bonus (Epic Mage Armor)<br>5 Natural Bonus (Epic Mage Armor)<br>5 Deflection Bonus (Epic Mage Armor)<br>5 Dodge Bonus (Epic Mage Armor)<br>12 Undeath's Eternal Foe (Undeath's eternal foe stacks with itself)<br>4 Haste (Travel Domain)<br>1 Dodge Bonus (Mage Armor - Bard Spell - must be cast when not wearing full plate)<br>------------<br>87 AC<br><br>It can be less due to the fact that Undeat's eternal Foe seems to be Dodge AC, you already have 6 Dodge AC (epic mage armor and mage armor) so it is possible that you hit the cap.<br><br>By the way, I use to count with the "pseudo AC and DR" you get from prayer (-1 enemy AB, -1 Enemy damage) and battletide (-2 enemy AB, -2 Enemy damage).<br><br>If going for an unhittable tank you could try to fit improved expertise in order to get:<br><br>87 (Fully buffed) AC<br>+3 (Pseudo AC from prayer and battletide)<br>+10 (Improved expertise)<br>- - - - - - - -<br>100 Effective AC with mundane gear<br><br>If you combine it with Trickery domain (improved invisibility, 50% concealment) you are nearly unhittable. <br><br>I like your build as it is.

Nice ideas there<br><br>If more 9th level spells are available then you could take a few Undeath's Eternal Foe in the slots, but 1 should suffice in most instances, doesn't last for long unfortunately as only 20 cleric levels taken, and you can't Extend it.<br><br>In PWs with perma haste items, drop Domain Travel straight away, as it is completely unnecessary, so in those instances Trickery would be the priority.<br><br>Expertise/ Imp Exp - this can only really be swapped out for KD/IKD or Blind Fight and IKD. Not sure if it would be so effective without them - personal preference I suppose.<br><br>As for the mages, Kaliban, I think they may just dance around wildly. Still it might be fun to try and find out. I'll try it and see <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>As for the AI hak.. that sounds worth a try.

fernan's AC calculations are a little optimistic.<br><br>he counts +5 MV and +5 armor from epic mage armor, which don't stack.<br><br>The maximum ac I can get for this char is as follows:<br><br>10 base<br>10 palemaster<br>8 fullplate<br>3 tower shield<br>8 tumble<br>1 dex<br>20 epic mage armor<br>15 (additional dodge bonus -- not sure if foe stacks still work, but we'll include it)<br>5 magic vestiment on shield<br>-------<br>80<br><br>without foe stacks it is as follows:<br><br>10 base<br>10 palemaster<br>8 tumble<br>8 fullplate<br>3 tower shield<br>1 dex<br>20 epic mage armor<br>5 magic vestiment on shield<br>4 haste<br>1 mage armor<br>4 foe<br>---------<br>74<br><br>you'll be most likely walking around every day with 70 ac, and maybe cast foe when facing a tough opponent.  This is a very respectable AC and most enemies (unless killer custom ones) will have trouble hitting you.<br><br>I'd suggest getting empower spell.  This is good for bull's cat's, etc... if items are not available to max out your stats.  Also great for casting blade barriers that do 100+ damage.  <br><br>Also silent spell is nice for a cleric so you can cast mass heal at lvl 9.  Your char is geared towards fighting, but it can come in handy when you're surrounded and losing health fast.  A quick mass heal will fix you and your allies and turn the tide of battle.<br><br>Also, you don't have a lot of con.  I'd suggest lowering your int and putting some more points into con.  regular knockdown works pretty much as well as the improved version (only can't kd giants and such). Skill loss is also a consideration (trading taunt most likely for more hps). <br><br>You will be well protected against physical damage by your AC, but spells (especially reflex based ones) will knock down your health really fast.  You won't make your save and your sr spell will only be 32 with 20 cleric lvls, so you will get hit by spells in many situations.  More con will give you more hps which means a better chance of getting that heal off before you die when you're bombarded by a bunch of reflex nukes.  Anyways, something to consider.<br><br>I really like this class combination.  It is good for tough fighters or tanks or even support clerics.

Yep, you are right jjjhhhlll about the AC limit, without Imp Expertise. <br><br>Magic Vestment can award 1 of 2 types of AC Bonus: on armor then it is an armor bonus, on a shield it is a shield bonus. A Shield bonus is not granted through Epic Mage Armor or Mage Armor, so to get this AC, you need to ensure that it is only cast on the shield. I have just tested this once again to be sure.<br><br>Using 3 casts from Undeath's Eternal Foe hits the maximum AC cap available, taking the maximum possible in mundane gear to 80 AC.<br><br>1st cast - 4 AC Dodge<br>2nd cast - 4 AC Dodge<br>3rd cast - 2 AC Dodge<br><br>Obviously these bonuses will drop if you manage to find any items with a Dodge AC Bonus.<br><br>Empower Spell would have been nice, and to be honest I Would take it if you get an item with both KD and IKD, that way you can take Silent Spell as well.<br><br>Fully buffed Saves are all pretty reasonable:<br><br>Fort 32<br>Reflex 23<br>Will 33<br><br>Nothing that a Ring of Improved Evasion wouldn't sort out, if the PW you use has it available, otherwise, I agree, it could cause a few issues.<br><br>You can also get Spell Resistance through Aura versus Alignment (only against Good or Evil mind you)<br><br>Fully buffed HP stand at 518/498, so not really that shabby, any further item with CON bonus can only improve that still further. Taking Toughness instead  of one of the KD or IKD feats gives you a further 40 points. I would hesitate to drop any from Intelligence, purely because of the skill benefits in both Discipline and Taunt that you gain from it. Again it is personal preference at the end of the day <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  (Note.. Taunt would be the preferred option to drop of them all, if any, as you mentioned jjjhhhlll).<br><br>BTW, Character Sheet Attack Bonus, when fully buffed  shows as +65/ +60/ +55, doubtful the game mechanics achieve this, as mentioned way beforehand, due to the 20 point cap.<br><br>All good points and feedback, thanks to all.

true. good arguments.  my suggestions are largely my personal preferences.<br><br>also your fully buffed ab will be 62<br><br>25 base<br>13 from str (36 str with +12 from items/buffs)<br>3 epic weapon focus<br>1 epic prowess<br>5 divine power<br>5 divine favor<br>2 battletide<br>1 bless<br>1 aid<br>1 prayer<br>5 greater magic weapon<br>--------<br>+62/+57/+52/+62/+62 (attacks with divine power and haste)<br><br>battle mastery and bard song will boost ab, but since you're at the +20 cap, it won't add anything else.  +damage and other goodies from those abilities are still nice though.<br><br>aura vs alignment sr is a non-issue.  it gives 25 sr.  Your sr spell will give 32.  these don't stack, so your sr will be 32.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By jjjhhhlll on 09/26/05 20:01</span></i></p>
