This build is another modification of the original Versatile Archer build, now called Pesky Mosquito. It was originally designed to be able to stay at range from melee fighters with monk speed and have good saves against casters, plus Improved Evasion. This on top of pretty good AC, nice AB, and moderate damage output. This version of the build sacrifices a few AB and AC, along with two Epic Feats and extra Skill Points, for 9/- Physical Resistance and 120 more HP, helping minimize two of its weaknesses: other archers with high damage output and IGMS. Plus it has a higher fortitude save, helping to compensate for yet another weakness, that being the fact that it isn’t immune to death magic.<br>On a server where you can get imm: death magic and either 5/- or 10/- magic resistance, this build should be extremely powerful in PvP.<br><br>Years of monastic devotion coupled with rigorous arcane studies have molded this surprisingly versatile archer. He not only boasts a vicious arrow, but can easily confound all but the most powerful spellcasters with his beefy magical defenses, and can avoid direct melee battle with his tremendous speed. On top of all of this, he has developed a very tough skin, turning many great strikes into glancing blows.<br><br>Starting Stats (Ending Stats)<br>STR 10<br>DEX 17 (24)<br>CON 17 (21)<br>WIS 8<br>INT 12<br>CHA 8<br><br>1 Monk-Point Blank Shot<br>2 Monk-<br>3 Monk-Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>4 Monk-<br>5 Monk-<br>6 Monk-Toughness<br>7 Monk-<br>8 Monk-<br>9 Wizard-Rapid Shot<br>10 Arcane Archer-<br>11 Arcane Archer-<br>12 Arcane Archer-Improved Critical: Longbow<br>13 Arcane Archer-<br>14 Arcane Archer-<br>15 Arcane Archer-Blindfight<br>16 Arcane Archer-<br>17 Arcane Archer-<br>18 Arcane Archer-Called Shot<br>19 Arcane Archer-<br>20 Monk-<br>21 Arcane Archer-Damage Resistance I<br>22 Arcane Archer-<br>23 Arcane Archer-<br>24 Arcane Archer-Damage Resistance II, Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>25 Arcane Archer-<br>26 Arcane Archer-<br>27 Arcane Archer-Damage Resistance III<br>28 Arcane Archer-Great Dexterity I<br>29 Arcane Archer-<br>30 Monk-21+ Discipline, Epic Skill Focus: Discipline<br>31 Monk-<br>32 Monk-<br>33 Monk-Epic Fortitude<br>34 Arcane Archer-<br>35 Arcane Archer-<br>36 Arcane Archer-Epic Will, Epic Prowess<br>37 Monk-Max Tumble<br>38 Wizard-40 Spellcraft<br>39 Arcane Archer-Armor Skin<br>40 Monk-Max Discipline<br><br>Final stats:<br>HP: 548 [15*8 (monk) + 23*8 (arcane archer) + 3*4 (wizard) + 40 (toughness) + 200 (con)]<br>30 AC Naked<br>With a mundane longbow, AB: +48/+43/+38/+33, dmg: 1-8 + 12 (19-20 x3)<br>Fortitude: 32 (+8 against spells)<br>Reflex: 30 (+8 against spells, with improved evasion)<br>Will: 24 (+8 against spells)<br>Spell Resistance: 25<br>Physical Resistance: 9/-<br>53 Discipline<br>+50% speed before even using a haste item.<br><br>Items to watch out for:<br>Death magic immunity items and magic resist items.

heh question and suggestion here.. why 21 con to finish with? an odd number wont help you.. instead of starting with 17 con you could go 16, and add the other 3 on to maybe strength or something.. maybe even pump up dex to 18 to start.. save a feat that way right?

You could start with 16 con and 18 dex with no change to the build.. I just decided not to. Actually 18 dex to start would probably make it easier to level with one more ac/ab. You use your first 5 stat points to pump con, then the last five for dex, plus a great dex, and end at 21con/24dex.<br>The reason I didnt take it up to 22 con is because I'd either have only 22 dex if I didn't take Great Dex, or 24 if I took Great Dex II. I preferred to save the feat for something else, but if you chose to drop something and go that route you could without significantly changing the build.

I can understand the 21 Con for DR feats, but I can also understand why you were asked why 21 Con. Why not 22 Con and 20 Dex? I don't see any feat selections that require 21 dex, so in effect you are costing yourself another 40 HP. Dropping dex down to 20 doesn't cost you any AB either unless you are working stats around items.

As a dex-based archer, I lose 1 ab and 1 ac when I lose 2 dex (or just an extra feat for another Great Dex, in this case), which to me is more valuable than 40 hp. If it isn't to you, you can change the build slightly. The way I see it, this build already has solid hp for an archer, but it has lower ab than many archers, and ac is always an issue for archers.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

The stat bonuses come on even numbers and not odd, therefor having 20 dex and 21 both net you a +5. Having a 21 Con nets you a +5, while having a 22 con nets you a +6. One stat point shift nets you 40 more hit points with no AB loss. That is how I figure.

I don't play monks much so this may be a very stupid question... but why don't you go pre-epic 8 monk/2 wiz/10 AA ending 14 Monk/3 Wiz/23 AA or if you get 10% bonus speed every 3 monk levels (which I believe) end 12 Monk/3 Wiz/25 AA netting +2 AB and +1 dmg (+ lvl 2 castings) for -10% walk/run speed.<br><br>all archers are dependant on sky-high AB and since this nets you +2 I think it's worth it (plus cats grace)... but then maybe it isn't so much a change as a personal twist.<br><br>good build though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Well, if you wanted to drop three monks to gain that 2 ab/1 damage bonus, i wouldn't blame you, but i happen to prefer the speed. I tend to think the greatest strength of a monk archer build is the speed. Since the ab is already better than your average melee fighter and the damage output is fairly decent, i feel that the speed bonus just lets you be able to maintain that distance even better, for a faster kill and an easier kill. But again, it's entirely up to you.. some people may be happy with even just a 30% speed boost, in which case go 8 monk 2 wiz 10 aa pre-epic, then take that last monk/and 2 wiz (which i guess would give you an extra spell slot, not that your spells are really worth much) at the very end to max tumble/spellcraft, and you get 27 AA, meaning you'd have 3 ab and 2 damage more than the build as it stands, which needless to say is nice, but it's all about preference.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

Here's a crazy question.  Is this supposed to be an elf?  If so, the stat points are wrong, since elves get -2 con, 17 con is out of the range, and with +2 dex, 17 con costs more than 17 dex.  If not, where's the longbow proficiency?

I couldn't tell you any more. I really don't remember; all I know is I made essentially that exact build successfully. Either it's human and I left out the extra feat which would be used for martial weapon proficiency (which you may not be able to take at level one, so there would be a bit of shifting), or it's elf, and perhaps the starting stats would be more like 18/16, or 19/15.. something like that. My guess is it's intended to be an elf, and I accidentally messed up the stats and treated them like human ones when I edited the build.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?
