It has been more than a week since the last time I checked on Griphook's activity... it still remains at same date, Feb 09. Hopefully nothing bad has happened...<br><br>However, in the absence of Griphook, anyone is welcome to ask me if they can become a moderator and I will consider it. It all depends on how often you are online, how often you post, and so forth. Also, the big factor I look for is how helpful you are with other guild's member and with their questions.<br><br>Oh and, you don't have to necessarily have to ask to become a moderator, but you can support someone and I will look into asking them if they would like to be moderator if they meet the criterias.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.

It's good to see this topic - I was actually going to suggest to Anuis that he promote someone to moderate the daily posts, even if they don't have time to inventory and catalog builds like Grip has done.<br><br>I support Kail's nomination as a moderator. He has always been an informative, supportive and patient guild member.<br><br>I would also nominate Grimnir.<br><br>I can't recall either of these individuals getting into spats with other posters, yet have been regular, positive posters.<br><br>I would also nominate Cinnabar, although i) he may not be able to be a guild moderator since he's a Bioware mod, and ii) he just may not have the time to patrol so many forums.<br><br>And if you'd like to spice things up a bit, you could put me in the admin role. I run a tight ship and don't brook backtalk - I would simply delete personal spat posts and such nonsense.

Thanks for the nomination and the support, fellow posters! I'm flattered by the consideration you have of me.

I've updated the search to match the new index, also made slight change to the class selection pull-downs. Should make it easier to use, hopyfully without much confusion.
