(direct conenct nwn-rome.com)<br><br>On that server, you really need some rogue skills if you want to enjoy treasur and also able to survive in hostile area.<br><br>I would like an idea of how to make a build that have:<br>1- archery base (like aa);<br>2- able to pick lock, disearm trap, search;<br>3- do good domage in order to survive;<br>4- level cap 30<br>5- good skill for PvP (it's allow on that Role play server)<br>6- will enjoy each level until 30. I mean not start to be good at level 30 only.<br>7- Can not use class like shapeshift and RedDragon Diciple.
