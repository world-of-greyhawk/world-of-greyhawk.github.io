O.k. I was reading through the builds as I was looking for a unique build for the action server I play on and came across the build The Order of Jormungandr, and some stated that the Bard 3/SD 10/ AA 27 was banned from almost every server for being too uber.  Could anyone one of the wise ones explain why?<br><br>Basically I had never even contemplated this build, but now I know it's there I shall give it a go<br><br>Thanks

Bard 3 / Shadowdancer 10 / Arcane Archer 27 sounds quite powerful, it's a high AB and damage (with 27 Arcane Archer levels, anyone has high AB and damage) archer with HiPS and Epic Dodge, a melee build would be unable to fight back against a good player using that build, so that makes it very strong.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Thanks for that Thax, but how would you go about getting the necessary prereqs for both SD and AA after just 3 lvls of bard? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">

You'll need at least 7 lvls of bard to qualify for SD, and Bard8 or Bard7/SD2 to qualify for AA.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

So it's not physically possible to do it via normal means?  If it were, what would you take first AA or the SD

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  Well I didn't check if it was a legal spread... it would probably make a decent build anyway (once made legal), you do get HiPS and Epic Dodge with a Bard / Shadowdancer 10 / Arcane Archer distribution, and AB can't be bad on an AA.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

thanks once again,on the build search I did found one similar which was Mithdradates' build, which I am attempting to build on the server I use.  With the items they have there it should do very well <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By saidinspain on 09/21/07 00:00</span></i></p>

I just deposited my coffee on my keyboard.  I realize it wasn't deliberate, but thank you for the unwitting humor.  Some old jokes just don't die, apparently.
