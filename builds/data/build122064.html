Here is my build of the 'Disappearing Champion.' I wouldn't mind any feedback to make this character better since he does have certain weaknesses that would be covered by being in a party. His ability to use deal massive amount of damage with the rapier and avoid being hit in battle or vanish in the air at times makes him a formidable character.<br><br>Starting Stats for Elf Rogue 19/Champion of Torm 20 /Shadowdancer 1.<br>STR 14 +2<br>DEX 19 +4<br>CON 8 -1<br>INT 13 +1<br>WIS 8 -1<br>CHA 12 +1<br>Skill Points <a href="mailto:increases@lvl">increases@lvl</a><br>INT 4<br>DEX 8,12,etc.<br><br>Lvl Progression - Feats<br>1-12 Rogue(1-12) - Toughness, Weapon Focus(Rapier), Weapon Finesse, Dodge, Iron Will, Improved Evasion<br>13-20 CoT(1-8) - Mobility, Improved Critical(Rapier), Knockdown, Blind Fight, Great Fortitude, Improved Knockdown<br>21 SD (1) - Great Dexerity I<br>22-23 CoT(9-10) - Armor Skin<br>24-27 Rogue(13-16) - Defensive Roll, Great Dexerity II &amp; III, Epic Dodge<br>28-31 CoT(11-14) - Great Dexerity IV, Epic Weapon Focus (Rapier)<br>32-34 Rogue(17-19) - Self Concealment I &amp; II<br>35-40 CoT(15-20) - Self Concealment III &amp; IV, Epic Prowess<br>Ending stats:<br>STR 14 +2<br>DEX 32 +11<br>CON 8 -1<br>INT 14 +2<br>WIS 8 -1<br>CHA 12 +1<br><br>Skill:Ranks<br>Tumble: 35 (+7 to total AC)<br>Hide: 30<br>Move Silently: 30<br>Lore : 25<br>Disable Trap : 40<br>Open Lock : 20<br>Search : 40<br>Listen : 30<br><br><br>AC: 30 (Armor Skin &amp; Tumble included)<br>Fortitude: 33<br>Reflex: 45 (49 against traps)<br>Will: 28<br>Attack bonus: +42/+37/+32/+27<br>Attack bonus with Divine Wrath(lvl 20) for 1 round: +51/+44/+37/+32<br><br>This character has 40% concealment and Epic Dodge that will definitely help it in battle along with a sneak attack of +10d6. Uncanny Dodge V will give it +4 reflex saves against traps while retaining dex bonus to AC. He also has lay on hands that will heal about 20 hp. With extra charisma Divine Wrath will last 1 round longer per charisma modifier. Saves are also improved by 9 and damage is an additional 7.<br><br>Weaknesses include low maximum HP total of 322. Will and fortitude saves are alot weaker compared to reflex saves. Against True Seeing, Undead, Constructs, and anything immune to sneak attacks, this character will not be effective at all unless he has and use magic scrolls and wands to his/her advantage.<br><br>Edited By BRIAN FELLOW on 03/30/04 16:37:37

Hmm that will allow the fifth self-concealment feat.<br>Those skill points will be great for appraisal and set trap skills. Since I'll usually be in a party on a server-vault PW, then I would definitely rely on others in the lower lvls of this character and help them sell items for more gold and buy items for a lower price.
