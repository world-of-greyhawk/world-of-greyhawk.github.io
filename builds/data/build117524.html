A redesign of a previous character I posted... The Dwarven Wall. This character is designed to have damage reduction 35 (the most possible without an alignment change) and devastating critical. He's got a lot of hit points, and is designed around the theory that it doesn't matter if you get hit if you can't be hurt. He's good at moving around in combat, and when overwhelmed he can mix whirlwind attack and defensive stance to devastating results.<br><br>starting stats:<br>str : 16<br>dex : 13<br>con : 16<br>wis : 10<br>int : 13<br>cha : 06<br><br><br>levels:<br>1-7 fighter<br>8-17 dwarven defender<br>18-20 fighter<br>the rest dwarven defender<br><br>skills to take :<br>discipline<br>tumble<br><br>other skills I took :<br>craft armor<br>craft weapons<br>craft trap<br>(dwarven smith, doncha know)<br><br>all stat points in strength.<br><br>feats:<br>1 - power attack / cleave<br>2 - dodge<br>3 - toughness<br>4 - mobility<br>6 - weapon focus and specialization : greatsword<br>9 - spring attack<br>12 - expertise<br>15 - whirlwind attack<br>18 - iron will / improved critical : greatsword<br>20 - great cleave<br>21 - great constitution 1<br>24 - great constitution 2 / armor skin<br>27 - great constitution 3<br>28 - overwhelming critical : greatsword<br>30 - great constitution 4<br>32 - epic weapon focus : greatsword<br>33 - great constitution 5<br>36 - devastating critical 1 / damage reduction 1<br>39 - damage reduction 2<br>40 - damage reduction 3<br><br>ending stats:<br>str : 26<br>dex : 13<br>con : 22<br>wis : 10<br>int : 13<br>cha : 6<br><br>I redesigned this so that you could get the crit feats sooner, and do more damage earlier. There's only so many hit points you need at low levels, so I took the stat points in strength and saved the epic feats for getting the pre-requisites for damage reduction. The end result is he's a lot more useful at early levels, and is viable from level 1 on as a good melee build. Before anyone asks, I took iron will because otherwise you'd get dominated by a first level kobold with a charm person scroll.<br><br>screen shot here: Click Here<br>By the way, he crafted the armor and sword himself.

you say that 35/- is the most possible dr without an alignment change.  What is the most possible dr With an alignment change?  Can we see a build?

Have you thought about limiting your fighter levels to just 4, for the weapon specialization?  Switching out the remainder of the levels to Champion of Torm would help increase your saves, and you will still get 1 feat every 2 levels (at least up until CoT 10.... which I don't think will be a factor for this build).<br>_________________<br>"The Sky is not the limit to Mastery, for (as any science fiction enthusiast can tell you) there are infinite worlds left to explore once the sky is left behind."<br>From "Role Playing Mastery", by Gary Gygax.

Phrost did revamp it with 2 levels of CoT.  He did that a while ago and you can see how well it worked here:<br><br><a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_dwarvenwall.html" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br>He made it a Fighter 8/ CoT 2/ DwD 30.

Bump, would want feedback.<br><br>Doing this build at a 20 lvl server but with a focus on con. Got 195 so far unbuffed without items at lvl 11, can get it to 239 with defensive stance and potion of endurance... Can solo two lvl 13 giants loosing 75 hp as it looks now and my worst saves (ref and will) are +7 vs spellcasters, +9 when in stance. Consequently, fort is +17 vs spells and poison and +21 in stance.<br> <br>Question is, should I get monk when I'm past 17?<br>CoT? Or maybe Rogue?

christian is right, 30/- DR is the maximum.<br><br>plus, why not take WM levels? fighter 7 / DwD 26 / WM 7 is pretty much a standard build these days, trading in 3/- DR for the WM damage bonuses.<br><br>give him a nice warhammer and you've got pretty much the iconic dwarf right there.
