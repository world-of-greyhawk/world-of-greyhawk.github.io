I want to do a Barbarian/Fighter something along the lines of Anuis' "Wrathful Berserker" posted <br><a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_wrathfulberserker.html" target="_blank">here</a>. My problem is that my PW makes you take at least 3 levels in your first class before taking a second class.  I don't know how taking the first 3 levels as fighter (as opposed to the first 2 as per Anuis' guide) would effect the overall integrity of the build.  I know that you have to take certain classes at certain levels and all that mumbo jumbo I don't understand.  Could I just take an extra level of fighter at 3 and drop one of the other levels of fighter out later in the build -- which begs the question, at which point should I drop a level of fighter?  At 20, 21, 24 or 25?

That shouldnt affect anything at all. Just forget about the level of Fighter at level 10 and put it at level 3. You can still follow everything exactly as is beyond that point, if you want to.

BASIC nwn building:  there are only 2 reasons to take a class  1) to gain a feat or 2) to gain skill set.  That is it.  The mystery to character building is that simple.  I wish it was more, but it really isnt.<br><br>Skill basics: at lv 1 you start with 4 pts you can put to any one skill to max that skill for the level.  Make sense?  That means, at lv 2, you max a skill at 5!  Most, if not all skills, gain benefit at multiples of 5, and give nothing for more or less than the multiple (tumble for example, gives no more benefit for 41 vs 40).  SO, when you are using Rogue or Bard, for example, for Tumble dumps, in order to get the best bang for your buck, it makes the most sense to add these at lvls where tumble will be multiples of 5.  So, you will see rogue at lv 7, 12, 17, 22, etc, or lvl +3.  <br><br>Feat choice is more complex and really is determined by 1) your play style, 2) what the build is going to accomplish, 3) the pw, etc.  It isnt as easy to have set rules cuz i have played many a cleric with pure caster lvls at 24 and only able to cast lv 6 spells (meaning my base wisdom is 16) because i was going for another feat before finishing casting. (  Under the PRC section in ECB you can read my hospi/heiro/cleric build to see what i mean. )  I am certain that others would make sure they have 19 wisdom before going for the feat.  THat is all i mean.<br><br>What makes Anuis, Grizz, Kail, and Mith such extraordinary builders is that they seem to have unique ways to approach the feat side of things.  It is here that the artistry and the true genius is found.  Skills are generally easy.<br><br>I hope that helps you.  I noticed you have been here since 2004, which means that maybe, we didnt do such a hot job in setting up nwn building basics..<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted <b>06/23/04</b> 21:16 (GMT) -- Anuis<br><br>Suolucider, Blitz 04, <b>avado</b>, Quisition, Boourns, ... welcome to the guild!

Going to chime in a bit.. <br><br>Overall, there should not be much of a difference if you exchange the level 3 with fighter instead of barbarian. <br><br>However, you will miss the fast movement and rage that you get from first level of barbarian. It's quite nice to have more strength at early levels from using rages. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  +4 to strength and con ain't too shabby. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"> <br><br>Anyway, you will be delayed just until level 4 which is not a big deal.<br><br>There are also some feats you can change around without any problem, for example, I would exchange Weapon Focus with Great Cleave and take Great Cleave in place of Weapon Focus. Unless you have mobs which Great Cleave probably would be more ideal to be taken earlier.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.

I'm probably missing something obvious...<br><br>...but why not drop starting dex to 14, con to 16, and put all points into str?

No idea, I'd definitely drop some WIS and DEX for CON, STR or even INT, delay Epic Weapon Specialization for Great Strength I, drop Improved Power Attack in its place and fill with another Great Strength instead of Epic Toughness.
