Hi everyone.<br><br>So; I was looking over the builds I've tried in the past and I realised that, by tweaking the level order a little, sometimes better feat options are available.<br><br>I guess the question is, how does one work out the best feat-taking levels for a build?  EG; Taking a fighter level at character level2 will get one extra feat, BUT take it at lvl1 and you get two feats.  That's a sacrifice of one feat for a feat-starved build.<br><br>Any guidance welcome!

You just get to take your bonus feat one level earlier.  Is that what you were trying to say?<br><br>Steve<br><br>Edit: Honestly, I don't really plan my characters that way, expect when I have things like SC V, which requires somewhat more careful planning.  Usually I decide my pre-epic and final level breakdown, see how many feats I get, figure out the feats I want, and only then do I fit them in where they would go best.  Maybe I'll move around my levels a bit if I really need an extra feat (like taking 2 more fighter levels at the expense of something else, for example).  But I'm generally able to mix in the feats appropriately throughout the build after I have a rough idea of the leveling order.  Very rarely do I find that I have to make many (or any) adjustments to be able to get all my feats...there's generally quite a bit of leeway.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 06/24/05 09:26</span></i></p>

Usually I find that.. and thanks fer the fast reply Steve.<br><br>I tend to make rather tight feat builds (usually having no spare feats for the things that are essential for the build, like dualwielding for dexers or Epic UMD focus for umd-capable builds); and would be nice to know how to reassemble the levelling to get the things I need.

Give an example and people will be more than happy to optimize it.<br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while

Hmm if you know the feats that you need to take then all you have to do is figure out the order, which should depend on the strengths of your character.<br><br>I usualy figure out how many feats I want a character to have and go from there. I know how many I can have pre-epic, and how many in epic.<br><br>Like a caster with only 23 lvls and epic evocation, i know i need 3 for evocation, 3 for penetration, 2 for combat casting.<br>well theres 8 feats right there, with 5 of them in pre epic.<br><br>so thats how i would suggest you figure out you feats.<br>start with the epic youw ant, and work yourway own from there.

Good points so far.  I'll post a build that I've been toying with, maybe some idea's can come from it.. would be nice to fit in an extra two feats in it if possible.<br><br>Will post it tonight; at work atm.
