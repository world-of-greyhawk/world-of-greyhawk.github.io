Hmmm, well your 21 damage minimum is hardly a true statement, your minimum damage is 1d6+2 + weapon enhancement, your buffs are not eternal and they can always be dispelled with Mordenkainen Disjunction. Your unbuffed AB is good though, your AC is fine, but your HP sucks, so you won't beat any mage.<br><br>I would take Divine Might instead of Armor Skin at level 21, and switch Epic Toughness for Armor Skin at level 40, you should worry about your damage output.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Good idea for the armor skin/toughness switch. But the HP dont suck so much. You can add 240 hp by maximize consitution that a 548 hp its enough for the most of the time.

You can't buff CON, so if you assume you can add +12 CON with items then your enemy can also do it and your HP still sucks, since you wrote "PvP build in arena" up there.

Please check the posting rules for proper formatting (link in my sig).<br><br>You are a monk, you're a dexer and you use a rapier?

"proper formatting" sorry i already post a build with this template and no one say something about it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   going to fix that if i post another build. <br><br>I dont have choose Kama for one reason, i fight with a tower shield. Then i lost the -3/-3 etc bonus and the 2 bonus attack. If you change the build for kama he going to be more effective with halfling. I use shield because its hard to max CON, DEX and WIS. For a maximum of 8 AC with wisdom and 1 AC with monk level. Its just a lost of 1 AC (People can "change that" if you have the stuff for).<br><br>For the harper scout i does'nt know about the tumble *Dont use this class a lot of time* Pretty good idea. But this build dont really need skill point. That why i started with 20 BaB.<br><br>EDIT<br>Ew that was the title, sorry <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> .<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ILikeKillAndYou on 12/17/07 20:52</span></i></p>

Hmmm.  A monk using a tower shield.  Seems like an odd choice to me, personally, since you lose out on some of your monk abilities, most notably the speed.  Also, I'd be more than a little concerned with a lack of scroll use on a PvP build.  You don't have access to improved invisibility, or see invisibility scrolls, for instance.  Also, as a Dex build that can't use any Visage, Globe, or Mantle scrolls, and has no innate SR, you will get Horned, and chewed to pieces on a PvP server.<br><br>Some suggestions then.  First off, the level split.  If you want to have your cake and eat it too, I recommend dropping Harper Scout and adding Rogue instead.  Some good level splits for a Paladin/Monk/Rogue are the classic 20 10 10, the 21 9 10, and 26 10 4.  I recommend losing the tower shield, and wielding either a kama (or 2 kamas) or going unarmed.  Preferably the kama, as you can cast holysword on it.  Rogue will give you Use Magic Device, so you can scroll buff, and also add some sneak attack damage, since most Dex builds lack output in that area.  You might even have enough skill points for set trap, too.<br><br>As for your starting stats, drop 1 each from str and cha.  I know, it'll make them uneven numbers, but you can put those 2 points into Con, and with the Toughness feat, will negate any hp loss from a low score, net 1 more on your Fort save.  Stick with Divine Shield, as you should be able to get around 77ish AC with it.  Also, with the 20 10 10 split, you can get epic dodge.  Take 1 or 2 monk levels pre-epic.  Even though you will lose 1ab, you will save a feat to get proficiency in kama.  Unless you decide on unarmed, then go all Paladin pre-epic.<br><br>Since you won't need Alertness and Iron Will, you can pick up Improved Critical, and Extend Spell, which in a PvP environment is crucial, especially for your Divine Favors, which you will use constantly.  In epic levels, consider taking Epic Fortitude over Epic Toughness.  The +4 to your Fort Save will serve you much better than 20hps will.  Since you started with an odd number for Dex, take 1 great dex in epic levels to even it out, and use the last feat for Epic Dodge.  Other than that, Epic feats look fine.<br><br>All in all, with this build on Badlands (which is where I assume you'd use it, as that's where I play, and I recognize your account name), with the right equipment you should get about 62ish+ AB and 77ish AC (+epic dodge) fully buffed, depending on your choice of kama or unarmed.  I have 2 different 20 10 10's like this, one with Divine Shield, and one without.  The one without has 71ac (+epic dodge) and 64 ab unarmed.  The other has 78ac (+epic dodge) and 62ab unarmed.  Both can set epic traps, also.<br><br>Sorry for the long post, and the extensive overhaul of recommendations, but I hope it's helpful.

Hmmm, Harper Scout used in epic in a Paladin Dex build and its not to further either Epic Dodge/SC or Great Smite acquisition.  Points for originality, though I must confess that there probably is a better way (and a better name) to get an elven Paladin/Monk off the ground that doesn't incur an XP penalty nor the heavy HS investment with little return.<br><br>Eh, it's an arena build.

There is a reason why the common builds are more common. Some build combos are stronger and more viable in a pvp or pvm setting. That's the most important factor the builds here are measured by.<br>If you can make a strong <i>and</i> original build, something that no one has thought of yet, and that's fun to play, you will get a lot of credit for that.
