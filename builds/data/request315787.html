Hello epic builders!<br><br>I'm a low magic world that is mostly PvE. The highest magic is typically around +3 for items. Leveling is fairly slow so getting to lvl 10 can take a from 2 weeks of consistent playing to a month. so I need a build that is capable thought out the life of the character.<br><br>server is FRC(Forgotten Realms Cormyr) btw<br><br>I'm in a dwarf only guild so the race must be Dwarven.<br><br>I'd like to be a ranged rogue with mostly rogue levels.(no shadowdancer allowed)<br><br>For skills, I'd like all the basic rogue skills so that I can be a groups trap smith/locksmith. Appraise is required as he will be a bit of a merchantish type as well. Also craft trap as the server allows you to break down traps as well as craft them.(I'm planning on less crafting and more braking down to make more money) and need healing skill as being a back line player I probably will be healing the tank or others a decent amount.<br><br>Also as my rogues AC is never really going to be on par with tanks i don't mind haven't a low AC. Wouldn't mind a decent ac but the goal is to never get within melee range. (ya its an unachievable goal but its the goal nonetheless)<br><br><br>So Summery of what i'm looking for:<br>- Dwarf<br>- Mostly rogue<br>- Low magic realm PvE oriented slow lvl'ing<br>- Ranged focus<br>- needs to have the basic rogue skills to be useful to a group(including healing) as well as being a merchant.(appraise and craft trap)<br>- NO SHADOWDANCER classes (I know I was sad but lets be honest 1 lvl of it makes almost any build a cheeze one)<br><br>I've been using the build searcher consistently and haven't found anything that jumped out at me for this what I'm looking for. I may of missed it honestly but I'm asking now for assistance in getting a good build up.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TemplariDM on 04/13/10 21:20</span></i></p>

What do you mean near pure:  21 levels, 25 levels, 30 levels, or 35 levels.  The higher the rogue the less you will be able to heal outside of healing kits and UMD.<br><br>Here are three strategies for complementing a 35 level+ rogue archer:<br>1) Dwarven Defender:  Immune to Flanking<br><br>2) Paladin: Fear Immune, Divine Might.<br><br>3) Barbarian: Speed increase.

You lose 2d6 sneak damage, but get 6 permanent (non-sneak) to make up for it ,you will average about the same on sneaks but it will be a great boost vs sneak immunes.<br><br>Feats to go for are the usual archer ones: rapid shot, point blank, WF, called shot (not that important, but nifty), Imp.

Ya I'm looking for a build to follow but still no luck, I've played with a few on my own.<br><br>For a weapon I've been debating longbow or crossbow, with a crossbow that would mean one extra feat for the rapid reload so I can use crossbows the same as someone else would use a bow. Crossbow is more dwarven style but I'm not sold on it since it would cost a feat and I've still not gotten a build to follow yet.<br><br>If anyone has a build I could follow that would be most welcomed.

You could also have a Cleric/Rogue/FTR without XP penalties (eg Cleric 18/Rogue 16/FTR 6).

As I mentioned there are ways to make builds without th eXP penalty, you'll need to keep the non favored base classes within 1 lvl of each other but for the 40th lvl (at which point you generally don't care anymore about getting XPs). BTW, are blank scrolls and bone wands (the latter is less important, you can craft them out of skeletons) easily available on FRC?

Haven't seen much mention of splashing in some monk levels for an AC boost, since it doesn't look like you will be using a shield or any armor besides robes.  Depending on the equipment on the server, you could use a sling and shield for an added ac boost, plus whatever else you might be able to get from a shield.

One example could be rogue 35, fighter 4, ranger 1. Going this route, I would suggest taking weapon finesse and focus in a good dwarven light weapon, such as the handaxe.<br><br>Finally, in the above build, possbly lower dex by 2, raising str by 2 and con by 2. 40 HP, (some) carrying capacity and 1 fortitude would seem a good trade, or raise int by 2 to take discipline.

Kail, no worries.  When i was looking through the posts above, the very first thing that came to me was a rogue/aa build aswell.  There is just something about what the OP asked that SCREAMS AA!  Too bad dwarves cant become AA's.  Oh right, whiz figured that out one time!

I suggest the Rogue Archer by Torias at the Epic Builds Page. I've played it and it works as well in game as on paper. It is a highlevel rogue, it is an archer, it is playable, has some solo abilities , great skillset and brutal damage (its actually quite insane). All you have to do is make a dwarf version (with a little less AB), drop the SD level for assassin or just another fighter level to fill in. Even drop the fighter to 5 and take the last on lv 39 for EWS and the discipline dump, gaining you 1d6 of sneak attack.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By lillesmurfen on 04/20/10 00:57</span></i></p>
