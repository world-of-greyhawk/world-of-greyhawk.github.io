Hello and well met. I'm planning to make something new in some random RP world. Due it's a RP world then i don't want a very min/maxed character. I can live with anything else, but i can't stand negative scores if there is no need for it.<br><br>   I want to begin as a bard/ cleric who can make people have a jolly good time, help to tie up wounds and bless and such activities. And then at one moment i end up dead infront of a higer undead controlled by a DM and i am turned into a living death. I somehow remake my character as a dead person and chose different classes and feats. For first, i need a good cleric/bard build that can go up to level 12-13 as a living form. Thats the first build i need. I need 9-10 levels of cleric because then i can summon a skeleton that fits the theme good. <br><br>So, now that i'm an undead, then i don't care for a negative charisma score. I want to still summon a skeleton and have and undead arm as soon as possible. When i get my arm then i want to take more cleric levels to get level spells. I just can't think that how can i be powerful enought at the lower leels when im finally a PM. Any suggestions? I could delay with PM level until ei get enought cleric levels to be powerful and then die and turn into a PM. Now, if i get my bone arm then how many levels should i take as a PM? 10 to get immunities? 12 to get extra 2 ac, 13 to get another feat? stop there or push to 16 to get another 2 ac and a feat? I know that i want to take a bard level somewhere in the end to maximize some skills. I need enought skillpoints for tumble, concertration and spellcraft and discipline. That needs 12 int. If i can spare some more then i could inest into UMD. Due to i focus into spell casting then i don't need melee feats. I get 8 preepic and around 9 post epic (7base+either 1 from pm and 1 from cleric, 2 from cleric or 2 from PM. Depends how i take the levels.) Since cleric has spells of different kinds and main power comes from eocation, then i decided to focus on eocation.<br><br>Toughtness, spl focus/greater spl focus on evocation, spell penetration, greater spell penetration, extended, maximized, combat casting<br><br>greater wis 4 or 6, epic spell focus, epic spell penetration, improed combat casting.<br><br>Please help me to mold him for maximum power within limitations.<br><br>THank you.

Why?  15 cleric gives you the +5 attributes that one desires (power muhahaha).  Then look for the 3 bard lvls (either take 1bard 15 cleric 2 bard to 18 or 15 cleric 3 bard   its up to you).  Then go hard core to pm.   I believe there is a build on the bioware page that fits your request <br><a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_combatmedic.html" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br>I admit there are some changes that you should do, but thats up to you.  Sorry  work just ended and i have to go <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    hope that helps<br><br>Peace
