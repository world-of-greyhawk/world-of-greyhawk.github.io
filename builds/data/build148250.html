Not bad. I'd definately start with the 14 STR route to take advantage of mighty bows. Starting elf or human is a tossup. I'd go human as you get the extra skill points. Elf saves you the martial feat, but costs you the freebie so there is nothing gained there. The extend spell isn't the greatest metamagic. You may get more from still or silent spell. Most of your buffs are the only thing that you will extend and they all will last long enough with 20 levels. Also you may want to move your spell focus down and zen archery up to get the AB sooner. Finally you may want to switch out something and work in spell penetration. As is you only have a +20 to the roll which may mean trouble vs anything with an item like mantle of epic spell resist. That's a preferance call though as you still would have very little chance penetrating a monks SR.

Actually i beleive with palemaster every 2 levels you get +1 spell penetration? And i had to take out the spell penetration to get the Zen archery and Martial weapon feats..Also 20 or 26 spell penetration vs. a monks 50-70 spell resist doesnt do too well. vs monks, smash them <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  i would think the 70 AB should be quite enough. levels 1-18 you can take those feats in ANY order it doesnt actually matter, though by those levels you usually dont have good arrows to work with anyways.<br><br>Also with 20 levels of cleric, the spells DON'T last extremely long. you have maybe one or two minutes of fighting before you have to re-cast those buffs. Extend makes them last 2ce as long, saves the hassle.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tilbono on 08/16/04 23:44</span></i></p>

its mostly for spells like devine power, devine favor, and the like.. the ones that are short-term buffs.. spell resist and true seeing you will have no troubles with. it all depends on your preference.. if you prefer to have the spell penetration and no extend.. get rid of that and armor skin or something.

If I'm correct it's BAB + dex modifier (not buffed?) + Weapon Focus + Epic Weapon Focus + Epic Prowess + magic enhancements (max +20).<br><br>I think the distinction between the two is the AB you get by levelling (ability points, feats)  and the AB you get by magic (weapons, spells, equipment).<br><br>Also Zen Archery doesn't appear to be working yet, <br>I've tried it, but it still uses the dex modifier <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  <br>Perhaps the next patch will fix it...
