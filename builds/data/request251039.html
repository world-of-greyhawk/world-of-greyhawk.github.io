I gotta say dude, SWITCH SERVERS!!!<br><br>I am not tryin to be a jerk about this, but let's get real for a second.  NWN2 is about 2-3 months away.  In this game we will be at the mercy of lv20 (and with ecl less) until they decide to add (if they add) epic lvls.  WHY, when we have so little time left would you want to subject yourself to that when we have all this epic splendor to keep us happy on these cold summer nights?<br><br>Other than that, to make a strong druid with 16 lvls you really got one choice.. take 16 druid lvls.  Oh, and when you go into a fight, make sure you use wild shape.... bear, if you like.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/08/06 16:20:00 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I think avado answered your question like no other could... </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 08/27/06 01:15</span></i></p>

With 16 Druid levels, you could get Elemental Shape, no?<br><br>And if you are determined to use Bear, then pump Wisdom and take a Monk level. Infact, take 5 Druid and 11 Monk or something...<br><br>If you are going to use the bear, I think Monk will benifit you the most, because you can't use the Druids casting while in Bear Form. Unless you want Dire Bear shape but I dont know when you get that.<br><br>I would say, get Dire Bear, then put the rest into Monk. <br><br>Yup.

There can be plenty of fun playing the low and mid levels. <br>Playing in low magic environments makes the casters powerful. Shifters normally do well too.<br><br>With 16 Druid lvls you get Elemental shape and lvl 8 spells.<br><br>All the Druid forms override Str, Dex and Con, so you don't have to invest much into them unless you need it  to qualify for feats. That leaves plenty for the "mental" feats where Wis is your primary caster stat and Int gives more skillpoints.<br><br>Multiclassing with Monk is big cheese, so if you like the flavor of more attacks per round, better AC and free class feats, go ahead.<br><br>Multiclassing with Shifter has much to offer with the flexibility of all the possible forms. With 16 lvls, you have room for the 5 qualifying Druid lvls, the 10 preepic lvls of Shifter and the cheesy Monk lvl.<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan
