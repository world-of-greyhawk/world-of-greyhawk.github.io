Hail, mighty ECB. Since the sad news of the guild have awakened the enthusiasm and nostalgia of some ancients, I thought I'd go out with style. This is my last build if the end of the world predictions are confirmed. It's inspired by Yar Stardawg's Priest of the Shadows build with the same spread, but this focuses on melee power instead of metamagic feats. Made more sense to me that it was so, since your WIS score is only 20.

I knew Stardawg!  When i put out my Dev crit dragon build on the pw forum, stardawg HAD to come out and make an ANTI dev crit dragon build!  We shared space on forums as well as in game.  A true top notch dude!<br><br>Talk about going out with a bang!!  Nicely done!

I like.<br><br>Were I to play him, I'd be tempted to play a halfling, XP penalty be damned.  Drop extend, raise CON to 14.  Otherwise he's much the same.  Mostly you just get style points, but, I think it works as a halfling, and that's reason enough in my book.  Dwarven might work well also.  Heck, Gnomish could work too.  Of course, if you're unwilling to abide an XP penalty, the build is best as it stands.  Personally, where I play, I wouldn't worry about any build with 26 cleric levels having difficulty gaining XP, but, ya know, boats floating, and all that.<br><br>Mostly though, very nicely done.  I know it's not wholly original, but I think this execution serves the level spread best.

I'm comenting more about your comments, as I won't really try to argue the halfling thing, mostly because of the loss of a skill, which does hurt.  All I mean to point out is that it is relatively simple to change the race, and the result would still be perfectly decent, albeit skill starved.  Still, I do take difference with your reasonings, so...<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/21/10 11:08 (GMT) -- Maximillian Kane<br><br>Dropping Extend Spell is really not viable in this build.

k, with 26 lvls, extend, while a great option, isnt a 100% feat, in my opinion.  It will not make nor break the build, then, which means it is, if so chosen, a toss away feat.  <br><br>The talk about skills, come on!! You are a cleric!  Clerics, in case you didnt know, get 2 +int mod (and if you get more than 2 (or 3 for human) you are sabotaging your cleric!!)  Clerics are SUPPOSED to be skill starved!  In this build, only spellcraft (+8 vs spells) and tumble (+8 ac) are absolute, in my opinion.  EVERYTHING else can be eliminated.<br><br>Discipline is such a waste because a simple Imm to KD (which are fairly abundant) eliminates the need for it.

Yes, i am probably the biggest fan of clerics in the guild, but i have always seen the "cure" spells as a waste of time and effort.  My focus was ALWAYS on offensive defence.

No double empowereds.  <br><br>For the record, where I play, healing is a huge advantage for the class.<br><br>As to discipline, it is my experience that discipline, without STR, or serious gear, is well neigh useless.  If it isn't going to keep you from getting KDed regularly, then it's not worth the investment.  If there's no KD gear, then DEX builds can likely only reasonably oppose a challenging KDer by virtue of a superior AC.  Hence, discipline on a DEXer is a waste.<br><br>As to Battle Mastery, and allocated resources, I'm assuming that one can't have access to every item property at the same time, as well as maxed stats.  If you're wearing CHA gear for Battle Mastery, that's a waste.  If you're swapping out a full set of gear to use an ability once per rest, then, first of all, you're nuts, and second of all, a -1 to duration, in exchange for dwarvishness, is easily worth it.

Oh crap NO!!  I honestly dont read much of the stuff that people write about their use of feats, but my god!  Are you serious??  Battle mastery is NOT worth gear slots to increase!  My god!<br><br>There was a discussion a while ago about a class being ONLY a collection of feats and skills to achieve a desired concept or something to that effect.  This is why the truly great builders build such amazing creations and the rest of us are stuck trying to understand our shoes...<br><br>In all my days have i never come across a build that was suggesting reliance on a domain feat like battle mastery!  Any time you have more letters in your name than the number of times you can use a feat per day, that feat better be one hell of a feat (like Dragon). That is why i have NEVER considered COT feats, for example as worthy of talking about in a build.  The one per rest just isnt reliable enough to be worthy of my time.  That said, the COT has other offerings that make it worth a build.  Please dont confuse the horse for the saddle.<br><br>Alas, just the 3 of us chatting is such a sad end to this magnificant guild <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">   even though the best may still be here, it just feels lonely <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">

<!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;As to Battle Mastery, and allocated resources, I'm assuming that one can't have access to every item property at the same time, as well as maxed stats. If you're wearing CHA gear for Battle Mastery, that's a waste. If you're swapping out a full set of gear to use an ability once per rest, then, first of all, you're nuts, and second of all, a -1 to duration, in exchange for dwarvishness, is easily worth it.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Oh crap NO!!

Rings aren't that great either, so with that char there is enough room for CHA-enhancing gear. I know it's not that big a deal, trust me, but it is nice to have a little uberness for big boss battles and such, and that's exaclty what Battle Mastery is for. I took War for AoV, Cat's Grace and BM, not just BM, and it's certainly not relying on it. <br><br>Having Cat's Grace on a DEX build seems like a no-brainer unless you can max it out with gear. In some cases, even if you can max it out with gear it's a good thing to have because you can free up slots for other items. For instance, you can memorize Empowered Cat's Grace and 2 Extended AoV's, then you only need a Boots of the Sun Soul +5 with +3 Dex enhancement to cap DEX 75% of the time, which frees up the bracer and belt slots for other items. There has to be a worthwhile item to fill each of the slots however, so it's environment dependent.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Alas, just the 3 of us chatting is such a sad end to this magnificant guild  even though the best may still be here, it just feels lonely </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Let's be honest, the guild was kind of quiet already before the news of deletion came across.
