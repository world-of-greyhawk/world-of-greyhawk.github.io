hey guys,<br><br>Im doubting between two builds<br>Cleric/Soldier of light/hospitaler<br>OR<br>Cleric/Hierophant/hospitaler<br><br>The meaning of the build is to destroy undead as quick as possible but not to trade in to much for it (aka it still needs to be good VS non-undead)<br><br>tips? (yeah avado Im kind of looking towards you)<br>_________________<br>If there is no struggle there is no progress.

Soldier of light, iirc was bugged. iirc and it has been a long time, the ab appears to push you beyond the +20 limit BUT we found that it is implemented incorreectly, and the ab from SOL actually adds like enchantment so you use up +20 max without really getting full use of the class.  At least that is what i think the issue we had with it was. <br><br>The speed of killing comes from the use of spell combos, either sov and firestorm (for constructs and groups of 5+) and SoV and Mass Heal for undeads.  People talk about implode and all, sure.  It isnt all that when you get hospi heiro working full out.<br><br>Just a note.  My ultimate prc build is 18 cleric or something.  IF you want 4 apr, go 7 cleric or whatever you need to qual for hospi.  I did the high cleric in order to get lv 9 slots if i needed them on gear for the pm i was using.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 11/27/07 23:01 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I agree with avado, Storm of Vengeance rocks, it stuns great, it can deal heavy damage over time, and Evasion doesn't work against it, you should try it in your strategy as well, too bad it's conjura</div></blockquote>

It depends on how much of a power gamer you are, whether human is better than half orc.  In my youth, i used to always believe that humans were superior because of the extra feat, extra skills, freedom of main base class.   <br><br>It actually took me a long time to try half orcs.  I really didnt like the int penalty, or so i thought.<br><br>What i found is that Dev crit is NICE to have at 21!  Especially in a clerical build like what we are talking here.  Maybe i am old school, but i dont understand holding out MAIN feats until the end of the build IF the build can be tweaked to get them earlier.  <br><br>Saying that, i havent played the hosp/heiro in a long time (when 169 came up, the server killd all characters previous..  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  )  You do have to settle for lv 5 spells for quite some time, iirc (lv 24 is when you can start to learn higher spells though you are a lv 24 cleric in essence).  I am aware that this could be seen in direct contradiction to what i said above but it isnt.   I consider cleric spells (not wiz or sorc) as part of the class, while dev crit is an essential feat.   I know when i get 19 wis, i will have lv 9 spells, so in my mind, it isnt urgent.  I was also very good at using what i had to get by!  iirc blade is lv 6, so in order to really be a threat until you get firestorm and SOV, look at a 16 wisdom start.  For most cases, blade is so nice to have.  <br><br>ohh.. sorry bout the length.  Personally, if you are looking for a PRC with style, look at my Cleric/Tempest/hospi build (in prc on ECB under avaods prc builds).  It is buggy, but lv 9 divine, prc epic spellls (ward, mantle, ema), with dev crit AND perfect twf with kukris (12-20 range).. and if you dont need high cleric lvls for slot items (a server specific thing) you can get 4 apr..  <br><br>In my humble opinion, any server using PRC AND allowing Hospitaler as a class will find clerics KILLING everything and it will be impossible to balance for the others.  Who ever thought up hospi should be shot!  I only wish it had been implemented as a nwn vanilla class... then maybe i would still be playing!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted <b>06/23/04</b> 21:16 (GMT) -- Anuis<br><br>Suolucider, Blitz 04, <b>avado</b>, Quisition, Boourns, ... welcome to the guild!
