It really is a question of which one you prefer since total damage is exactly the same. <br><br>Take 20 swings (coutn each as hitting) now for the two bladed sword you have:<br>18 x 8 = 144 (as in 18 of your swings on averave will be normal hits at 8 damage each, this is maximised)<br>Then add:<br>(2 x 8 ) x 2 crit multiplyer = 32<br>32+144 = 176 total damage<br><br>Then the Double headed axe:<br>19 x 8 = 152<br>(1 x 8 )  x 3 = 24<br><br>152 + 24 = 176<br><br>So they both would pull off about the same Damage.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Almalith on 10/20/05 22:47</span></i></p>

Yeah for the brilliant Scythe crits you need Improved Critical, Keen and Wm lvls, not only does that increas your Critical threat range but increases your multiplyer to x5! Threat range is... 20 then 19-20 then 17-20 then 15-20 I think, though don't quote me on that as i'm not sure.<br>_________________<br>~I am the wisest man on earth because I know one thing, and that is I know nothing.~<br>-Cairne

This is only 1 number on a d20. Keen doubles that to 19-20 (2 numbers on a d20, effectively adding 1 more number). Imp Crit does the same. If you have both, it doesn't take it from 19-20 to 17-20, because it ony 'doubles' the <i>original</i> crit range. So, a keen scythe with Imp Crit has a range of 18-20.<br><br>7 levels of WM increases the threat range by 2, no matter what the original range was.<br><br>A scimitar has a threat range of 18-20 (3 numbers on the d20). Imp Crit doubles it to 6 numbers (or adds 3 more numbers, if you will) to make it 15-20. Keen adds yet 3 more numbers to the range to get it to 12-20.<br><br>Add in 7 levels of WM and your range is 10-20.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;but its only in HotU chap. 2&amp;3 that you can apply keep to your weapon right?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>In the official releases, yes.
