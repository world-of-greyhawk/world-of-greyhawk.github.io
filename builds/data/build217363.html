IMO, the Undead Lord sucks because he has just about no offense - spells which are easy to resist - and crappy AB. Truestrike doesn't last very long. Buffs which don't last very long (all because of low casterlevel). Only major strengths would be his summons and highish AC...<br><br>That is why people usually don't go for so many PM levels.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

Even a build with low AC's would give this guy serious pain. How to hit. A build with medium AC and a little SR would just need to hit harder or more often, perhaps Debuff it. With 6 caster levels it's not tough to dispel even with a scroll. I have fought a few PM heavy builds in PvP in my time, and Don't think high AC alone is enough to save your hide.<br>What other pro's does this build have than high AC?

Well it does get epic warding and could take greater ruin instead of devestating critical.  Which may be a good idea in general because low AB equals low chance of landing a critical hit.<br><br>But indeed, a very PM heavy build tends to be a one trick pony.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
