***Warning***<br><br>This build is designed to use flaws in the game engine. It is also designed around having PvM fun, since it would be too cheesy to try to use this PvP.<br><br>***End of Warning***<br><br><br><br><br>Thie idea behind this build is decption.  If you do it right you can fool your friends in your party and they won't know what you are doing. You will have unlimited spells and Dev Crit as a backup.<br><br>You must start as an elf and choose the drow picture that exactly matches the drow picture that comes up when you shift.  You will also want to try to match the head that you get when you shift.  (ponytail head)<br><br>Race Elf<br><br>Stats<br><br>Str 17(25)<br>Dex 10<br>Con 6<br>Wis 12(14)<br>Int 17(19)<br>Chr 8<br><br>1 D Toughness(because you need HP help bad)<br>2 D<br>3 D Alertness<br>4 D Str(18)<br>5 D<br>6 S Extend<br>7 S<br>8 S Str(19)<br>9 S Power Attack<br>10 S<br>11 S<br>12 S Str(20) Weapon Focus LongSword<br>13 S<br>14 S<br>15 S Improved Crit Longsword<br>16 W Str(21)<br>17 W<br>18 W Cleave<br>19 W<br>20 W Str(22)Maximize Spell<br>21 S Great Cleave<br>22 S<br>23 S Great Wis I (Opens Up lev 3 Druid Spell Slot) (Infinite Drow)<br>24 W Str(23) Overwhelming Critical<br>25 W<br>26 S<br>27 W Spell Focus Evocation<br>28 W Str(24)<br>29 S<br>30 W Great Spell Focus Evocation, Spell Penetration<br>31 W <br>32 S Str(25) Great Wis II (14)<br>33 W Dev Crit<br>34 W<br>35 S (Max Hide)<br>36 W Int(18) Greater Spell Penetration<br>37 W Epic Spell Penetration<br>38 W <br>39 W Open Feat--Blind Fight..Combat Casting..Armor Skin...whatever...<br>40 W Int(19)<br><br>Now...to work the bug what you need to do is memorize 1 of each spell you like.  Next in unshifted form hit the hotkey to cast the spell you want to attack with...once the icon comes up to target the enemy press the hotkey to shift into Drow form.  Now finish casting the spell. What you may not have known is that the spell never gets marked as used in your spell book....so you now have unlimited IGMS and whatever else you want.  Since you went to the pains of trying to match your characters looks to the shifted character it would be hard to tell for people when you are or are not shifted.  If you could get a sword to hold unshifted with a cold aura and craft some armor to match the drows...they will never know.<br><br>Again...this is a gimicky...cheap sort of build, but with as long as NWN has been out now...sometimes you just want to find ways to amuse yourself in a different manner.  Please...if you absoulty hate this whole build...just ignore it.<br><br>Skill wise I maxed hide..concentration..spell craft..tumble..discipline..craft armor...move silent.<br><br>I also choose a generalist, but in retrospect...and illusionist may have been better for the extra spells.  Since I only have a 19 Int...spellslots are thin for the upper levels.<br><br>This build would actually be better as a kobold commando....since you wouldn't loose any strength, plus you get some great skill bonuses from the kobold.  The problem is you wouldn't be able to hide what you were doing.<br><br>I choose evocation since I just wanted to be able to rip out so direct damage type spells before engageing in melee to dev crit.<br><br>If anyone has any suggestions on how to improve the funfactor of this build, or how to improve his mage power please let me know.<br><br>Good Hunting to all......<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By WarriorCleric on 01/13/05 22:24</span></i></p>
