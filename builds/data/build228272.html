Well, here is a "maximum" PrC build for CoT. I decided to focus on the CoT's Charisma-based abilities. You could obviously do a str-based fighter/CoT, but I thought this was more interesting. <br><br>Playble Level 1-40, PvM (will also do well in PvP vs. Evil enemies).<br><br>Paladin(10), Champion of Torm(30), Human<br>STR: 14<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 12<br>INT: 10<br>CHA: 16 (32)<br><br>Hitpoints: 480<br>Skillpoints: 129<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 52/43/46 (58/49/52 with buffed Cha, 65/56/59 with Divine Wrath, 71/62/65 with both)<br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 36 (melee), 31 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 12/23<br><br>Discipline 43(45), Taunt 33(57), 43 left over (cross-classing tumble might be a good idea)<br><br>L01: Paladin(1): Power Attack, Weapon Focus: Longsword, P: (Divine Health, Lay on Hands)<br>L02: Paladin(2): P: (Aura of Courage, Smite Evil)<br>L03: Paladin(3): Divine Might, P: (Turn Undead)<br>L04: Paladin(4): CHA+1, (CHA=17)<br>L05: Paladin(5)<br>L06: Paladin(6): Divine Shield<br>L07: Paladin(7)<br>L08: Paladin(8): CHA+1, (CHA=18)<br>L09: Paladin(9): Extra Turning<br>L10: Champion of Torm(1)<br>L11: Champion of Torm(2): Cleave, CT: (Sacred Defense)<br>L12: Champion of Torm(3): CHA+1, Extra Smiting, (CHA=19)<br>L13: Champion of Torm(4): Improved Critical: Longsword<br>L14: Champion of Torm(5): CT: (Divine Wrath)<br>L15: Champion of Torm(6): Improved Initiative, Blind Fight<br>L16: Champion of Torm(7): CHA+1, (CHA=20)<br>L17: Champion of Torm(8): Called Shot<br>L18: Champion of Torm(9): Skill Focus: Taunt<br>L19: Champion of Torm(10): Great Cleave<br>L20: Paladin(10): CHA+1, (CHA=21)<br>L21: Champion of Torm(11): Epic Skill Focus: Taunt<br>L22: Champion of Torm(12)<br>L23: Champion of Torm(13)<br>L24: Champion of Torm(14): CHA+1, Great Charisma I, Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword, (CHA=23)<br>L25: Champion of Torm(15)<br>L26: Champion of Torm(16)<br>L27: Champion of Torm(17): Great Charisma II, (CHA=24)<br>L28: Champion of Torm(18): CHA+1, Epic Prowess, (CHA=25)<br>L29: Champion of Torm(19)<br>L30: Champion of Torm(20): Great Charisma III, (CHA=26)<br>L31: Champion of Torm(21)<br>L32: Champion of Torm(22): CHA+1, Armor Skin, (CHA=27)<br>L33: Champion of Torm(23): Great Charisma IV, (CHA=28)<br>L34: Champion of Torm(24)<br>L35: Champion of Torm(25)<br>L36: Champion of Torm(26): CHA+1, Great Charisma V, Great Smite I, (CHA=30)<br>L37: Champion of Torm(27)<br>L38: Champion of Torm(28)<br>L39: Champion of Torm(29): Great Charisma VI, (CHA=31)<br>L40: Champion of Torm(30): CHA+1, Great Smite II, (CHA=32)<br><br><br>The paladin level at 20 is for a Taunt skill dump, then cross-class Taunt every other level in Epic. A slightly less pure build would add a final Paladin level for a taunt dump instead, which would get taunt up to 67. Even at 57, it's fairly effective (can reach 63 with buffed Cha). Pre-epic feats are plentiful - you could easily trade Great Cleave and/or Called Shot for something else. The tough part is requirements - he doesn't have 13 in Int or Dex, and dropping one of the other abilities will be hard (str has to be 13+ for DM/DS, Wis has to be 12 to cast level 2 spells, Cha is his prime stat. You could drop Str to 13 and Con to 12 to get Dex or Int to 13 if you really want mobility or expertise or IKD or something....).<br><br>The AB of 36 seems low, but keep in mind that he can get +13 from Divine Wrath, +4 from Divine Favor, and +1 from Bless. That's 54 with a mundane sword and no str buff, 60 with buffed str. Throw in another +6 if he successfully Taunts the enemy. If the enemy is evil, he can smite 3x per day for another +11 AB (+17 with buffed Cha). <br><br>For damage, he can get +13 from Divine Wrath, +11 from Divine Might, +4 from Divine Favor, and +2 from Str, for 1-8 + 30 with a mundane sword. With buffed Str and Cha, he gets another +12 for 1-8 + 42. If the enemy is evil, he can smite 3x per day for an additional 120. The Extra Turning feat lets him use DM and DS up to 11x per day, lasting 11 rounds each time (17 if Cha is buffed).<br><br>Between the Paladin Cha save bonus and the CoT save bonus, saves are obviously excellent (and they get +13 from Divine Wrath as well, not that it's particularly necessary...). He will rarely fail a save other than an autofail on 1. He is as implosion-proof and Dev-Crit proof as it is possible to be. He can't cast Holy Sword, but he can wield a Holy Avenger. Give him one and he is a pretty good Mage-killer.<br><br>This is obviously not the ideal build - more paladin levels to cast Holy Sword and be undispellable would be nice, as would a single monk level for evasion, or 4 fighter levels for WS/EWS, but then it wouldn't be a "Maximum CoT" build.<br><br>TM

This is extremely subjective IMO, if you have all the allowed lvls of the chosen PrC (30) then the build should be considered a pure PrC, or better say a maximum PrC build no matter if there's 1 or 2 other classes.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Like Mick said, it was following the 10/30 rule. I grant that a third class would be good, as would dropping CoT to the high 20's to put a few Pal levels in epic for skill dumping.<br><br>TM

When you cross-class a skill, ANY skill, there is no way to raise the values above 21. This is why you should test builds at least in a leveler, doesn't take much time.<br><br>Since you have 23 ranks in Taunt, you can't use x-class points to raise it further. The x-classing you talk about with Tumble is correct if used to raise it to 21 or lower. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
