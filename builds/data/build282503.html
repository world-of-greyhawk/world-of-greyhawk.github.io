Go Wizard over Sorc, and drop 3 CHA for more CON or STR.<br><br>Edit: You've only 10 base INT, so bump that up by 1 and raise STR or CON by 2.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By mantis3 on 09/05/07 13:14</span></i></p>

I'm a little concerned with the damage and APR.  Stunning fist only lasts a few rounds and with 5APR and an average of  5 damage per hit (+ glove bonus) it looks like you'll be using a lot of stuns on a creature and may have problems getting a stun to land because of damage reduction/resistance. My particular worry is if the target can perform an action in between the stuns that would give him an advantage.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By WhiZard on 09/05/07 22:42</span></i></p>

I would try going 4 Fighter 16 Monk pre-epic to max your APR...<br><br>Certainly would go 1 Wizzy to get more skill points.<br>(using INT vs CHA)<br><br>You might want to consider dropping 4 Fighter levels to get 4 more Wizard levels to get silent spell as a bonus feat to have more true strikes...<br><br>STR is low but if you have bags of holding you are golden. <br><br>CON isn't as important as INT is in this case. I would much rather have more skill points because you have tons of speed to make up for your lack of HPS. Near Death = Run and heal kit yourself to normal.<br><br>Then corner sneak stun fist the pursuing enemy! <br><br>Plus I would seriously consider working Epic Weapon SPec into the build. The damage is rather weak. You might want to work on an Elven version as well, and compare the two.<br><br>I have an Elven 10 Fighter 25 Monk 5 SD that even with EWS only scores around 25-30ish damage. With full APR that is quite a long battle vs most mobs if you are solo. <br>My 2 cents!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By SKIPPNUTTZ on 09/06/07 01:01</span></i></p>

The purpose of me going fighter in epic levels is so I can max my Dc stun and this a pvp build can kill pretty much anything but high fort builds and PM's. Only Does About 15-30 damage but that is fine I can just keep them stuned. I tried to add Epic Spec but I lost more Dc that way.

Eh... and what about Red Dragon Disciples and Dragons? those are completely immune to stun, so you won't kill them either, don't overestimate your build with "it can kill anything". Epic Weapon Specialization is worth it, 4 damage at a loss of 2 DC is OK, you will stun them anyway as far as saving throws go, so take EWS to have a better stand against stun-immune enemies, with your damage, you wouldn't kill Dwarven Defenders either.<br><br>6 STR... you won't be able to carry anything... that's not fun.<br><br>AB is decent, thanks to True Strike, and the DC is pretty nice.<br><br>The build is good, I like it.<br>_________________<br>Join the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Pre-epic Character Builds</a> Guild for builds capped at level 20 and level 30.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 09/07/07 01:59</span></i></p>

RDD's cant be stunned? I thought they could I know dragons cant, but there is not many shifters on the server and I would have 18 str with items so not all that bad + bag of holdings. I see where epic spec would help a bit tho.

Sure thing, just check the <a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Dragon_Disciple" target="_blank">description</a>, at level 10 RDDs become immune to paralysis.

Are you sure on this?  I thought stun was separate from paralysis.  Anyway Palemaster 7 is immune to stun, polymorph self: zombie has a damage resistance of 10, and druid elemental form I believe is immune as well.

RDD's are not immune to stun.  Stun is totally different than paralysis.

Interesting build, but wouldn't try PvP'ing it (maybe as a support character, providing you either get your str up (you have no damage, and w. AB 38 (even true strike, you simply aren't going to hit much as don't have a lot of it, although empty body is nice so far as you can cast, doesn't last all that long; true, you can supplement with scrolls (then again, if you're counting on gear and scrolls to supplement then your foes are getting all that great stuff, too, and only so many ways you can enhance your fist as compared to weaponry)<br><br>While I must say that the DC is nice, that alone isn't enough and some great advice here since all the DC in the world won't do you much good if you don't hit in the first place and/or, even if you do land a hit, can't do damage/follow-through ...<br><br>RDDs aren't immune to stun (well, they pretty much are when combined w. Paladin and in your environs, where they, too, have access to gear, umd); on the other hand, your fort won't survive a dev.crit from them (well into the 50s, imo), and against anything with say EDR ... just not seeing any damage here on your end, not with a str 6 (conversely, with your HPs, don't need dev.crit, any old crit i.e. scythe/x5 in the hands of a WM for e.g. will pretty much do (yes, your empty body will be a pain to a melee'r for about 2 or so minutes, after which you'll definitely want to put your monk speed to good use and exit fast, since yes, monk AC is nice, but you've no uncanny to protect your dex (vs. them, or sneakers either). While, speed and empty body (while it lasts) is very sweet, won't help you much vs. wail, or implosion, or IGMS ... (and as against arcanists, true, they tend to have less fort, but they also have high AC and self-conceal (impr.invis., spell or scroll, or worse, if dex/rogue, possibly even SC5 which doesn't run out -- ever; then, there's that whole mestil's thing (comes in umd, too, meaning: even if you do stun then hit, you'll apr on to your own death)<br><br>That said, this is an interesting character (I like stunners that actually consist of monk) and you've a couple of nice things goin' on here (monk immunities are nice especially now that they finally got around to fixing the mind-immunity thing, plus your speed);  w. a little tweaking (again, great advice up there, re: str and con for sure, and would be interesting if you could work some stealth or kamas in, but definitely ws/ews at the least, thus making that DC/stun count (50s should be enough); anyway, cool concept and should make for a nice support character, just stay away from arcanists and RDD/dev.critters is alls I be saying, and beware heavy sneakers, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      <br><br>cheers, Tyr (and welcome to the guild) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good [people] to do nothing" -- Edmund Burke, Philosopher and Politician (1729-1797)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 09/24/07 13:47</span></i></p>
