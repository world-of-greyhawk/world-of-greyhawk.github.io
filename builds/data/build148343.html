That low dex and wis really hurts your monk abilities. Wisdom affects most of your special move DCs and obviously your AC. Also with low Wis, you deny the chance to get ki strike +4 and +5 so you will have trouble with any high DR critter. Also those high DR critters probably won't have much trouble hitting back, as your AC is fairly low.<br><br>What is your typical damage against a target when your character is naked?

36 average damage is pretty good. Have you tested this character against creatures like a mithral golem? or dracolich?

Nah monk gloves are all over the place. I was mostly curious how the damage output was vs something that had significant DR. I was wondering if you could outdamage your opponent in those situations. It seems you can.
