Yep, another Rogue/FTR/CoT (damn, this is a versatile combination!) This is basically your Rogue-heavy FTR/Rogue build (CoT is used just to boost saves). The intent is to build an effective STR-based Rogue that can still do pretty much anything (skill-wise) a DEX-based Rogue can do. He'd be ideal in a party situation, but should quite easily be able to solo in most environments as well.<br><br>Rogue 32/FTR 2/CoT6<br><br><b>Playable 1 to 40, PvM.</b> <br><br>Human, non-evil<br><br>STR 15 (28)<br>DEX 16 (18)<br>CON 14<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 8<br><br>1 )Rogue1: Iron Will/ Skill Focus:Set Trap<br>2 )FTR1: Weapon Focus:Greataxe<br>3 )Rogue2: Stealthy<br>4 )FTR2: Blind Fight/ DEX (17)<br>5 )Rogue3<br>6 )Rogue4: Knockdown<br>7 )Rogue5<br>8 )Rogue6: DEX (18)<br>9 )Rogue7: Imp Knockdown<br>10)CoT1<br>11)COT2: Expertise<br>12)Rogue8: Toughness/ STR (16)<br>13)Rogue9<br>14)Rogue10: Crippling Strike<br>15)Rogue11: Skill Focus:Disable Trap<br>16)Rogue12: STR (17)<br>17)Rogue13: Skill Mastery<br>18)CoT3: Skill Focus:Spellcraft<br>19)Rogue14<br>20)Rogue15: STR (18)<br><br>21)CoT4: EWF:Greataxe/ Epic Prowess<br>22)CoT5<br>23)Rogue16: ESF:Move Silently<br>24)Rogue17: ESF:Hide/ STR (19)<br>25)Rogue18<br>26)Rogue19: Imp Evasion<br>27)Rogue20: GRT STR I (20)<br>28)Rogue21: STR (21)<br>29)Rogue22 <br>30)Rogue23: GRT STR II (22)<br>31)Rogue24: ESF:Discipline<br>32)Rogue25: STR (23)<br>33)Rogue26: GRT STR III (24)<br>34)Rogue27<br>35)Rogue28: ESF:Open Lock<br>36)Rogue29: GRT STR IV (25)/ STR (26)<br>37)Rogue30<br>38)Rogue31<br>39)CoT6: GRT STR V (27)/ Armor Skin<br>40)Rogue32: ESF: Spellcraft/ STR (28)<br><br>AB: +39/+34/+29/+24<br><br>Naked AC: 24 (28 in mundane scale)<br><br>16d6 sneak attack<br><br>Saves (vs spells)<br>Fort: 26 (33)<br>Refl: 29 (36)<br>Will: 20 (27)<br><br>Skills (425 points)<br>Discipline: 42 (61)<br>Tumble: 40<br>UMD: 41 (40)<br>Hide: 43 (59)<br>Move: 43 (59)<br>Open Lock: 43 (57)<br>Search: 40 (42)<br>Set Trap: 38 (47)<br>Disable Trap: 41 (48)<br>Spellcraft: 20 (35)<br>Lore: 13 (15)<br>1 extra point.<br><br>Now, there may be questions about some of this, so I'll try to anticipate and answer them below.<br><br><b>Skills:</b><br><br>Hide, Move, Tumble, UMD, Discipline, Open Lock, and Spellcraft speak for themselves I think. <br><br><b>Search:</b> is raised to 42 to guarantee he can find any trap in the game, without fail (epic trap detect DC is 43, so 42 + 1d20 = guarantee). <br><br><b>Set Trap:</b> modified value of 47 +20 (Skill Mastery/Take 20) -2 (ACP of scale mail) = no chance of failure to set any trap in the game in any situation whatsoever (epic trap set DC is 65) while wearing his armor of choice (scale). <br><br><b>Disable Trap:</b> is heavily invested. This is done and augmented with Skill Focus in order to get to the magic modifier of 48. Coupled with Skill Mastery, this allows not only disabling, but also <i>recovering</i> of any trap in the game under any conditions (recovery DC of an epic trap is 68, as recovery DC is +10 to Disable DC). <br><br><b>Lore:</b> is topped up with the leftover skill points - you can do what you want with them.<br><br><b>FEATS:</b><br><br><b>Skill Focus:Disable Traps:</b> I've explained above. <br><br><b>Skill Focus:Spellcraft:</b> is included to bump the modified score to 35, good for +7 vs spells. (I adapted this build from another I was working on and found I had an open feat slot. I figured this was as good a use as any.)<br><br><b>Skill Focus:Set Trap:</b> is taken to offset the -2 ACP of his favored armor (scale).<br><br><b>No WS or EWS:</b> This is because he's meant to stealth around with a big old two-hander. He can sword and board if needed, but the Expertise feat is also taken to help out in rough situations where extra AC is needed and he needs high rolls to hit his opponent anyway. The extra damage from WS/EWS is not of paramount importance due to his bread and butter sneak attacks as well as his +12 damage modifier from STR and a two-hander.<br><br><b>Other Considerations:</b><br><br>DEX is raised to 18 to allow the use of full DEX in scale mail. Scale gives only a -2 modifier to DEX skills (Hide and Move penalties recovered with the Stealthy feat, Set Trap penalty recoverd with the SF:Set Trap feat). This allows me to have a decent Hide and Move skill with a STR-based Rogue, while not almost completely negating the ESF feats due to heavy armor. This also makes the AC acceptable (only 1 less than wearing plate) without having to invest heavily in DEX in order to wear the lighter armors or cloth.<br><br>Sorry, no story for this one - I overspent with the muse of late and she's left me for greener pastures.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 12/26/05 15:20</span></i></p>

i generally don't find Slippery Mind too helpful - it only works against spells with the descriptor "Mind-Affecting", which is a surprisingly small number.<br><br>a nice build, but requires incredibly careful playing. you don't have much HP with all those rogue levels, your AC isn't wonderful, and you didn't take SD either.

Actually, I was just about to complain about your Will Save as well.  I feel like it's too high for my tastes.  Me personally, I like to fail Will Saves, and wear such failures as badges of honor.  Somewhere around 16 or 17 is more to my liking, with a scant +2 from Dwarven hardiness, and that's it.  Let me have it!  I'm not afraid!
