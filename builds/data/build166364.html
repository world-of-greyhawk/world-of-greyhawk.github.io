<b>Playable from level 1 - 40</b><br><br><br>This is my contribution; a build losely based on Sbullies rakshasa but with more shifter forms and thus more versatility.

Risen lord, epic minotaur, iron golem with keen, greater magic weapon, flame weapon, haste, improved invis, shadow shield, spell mantles, mage shields, damage reduction, epic warding etcetera and be less vulnerable to paladins and clerics with bless weapon with only the rakshasa shape and are still a mage killer in rakshasa form (spell immunity and indefinite maximized icestorms).<br>Another advantage is the better playability if you start at lvl 1, since you gain shapes a lot earlier.

Looks cool but one question:  looks like you're losing at least 2ab by doing it this way (from shifter and Druid levels).  Would it not be better to do eg shifter8/druid8/wiz4 for pre-epic to keep the 2ab lost with Shifter9 and druid 6-8?  Then you could still get two more wiz levels after getting undead early while keeping some attack power

Build only contains 5 druid levels. When you take more druid levels you lose epic shifter levels, epic wizard levels and a bonus feat so you will be losing epic shapes or epic spells by gaining max 2 ab. Dont think its worth it. Maybe a druid 8 shifter 11 wizard 21 is possible but you will lose an epic shape and you will only get 1 epic spell.
