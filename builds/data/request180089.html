Hi im wanting to take a character who can duel wield these little axes <br><br>I was thinking of going Dwarf Fighter / gonna build in DWD for some Damage reduction and of course he'll need Dex of 15... I'd like him to be able to get atleast as far as OWC (( overwhelming crit )) and I'm also off thinking off adding in 7 lvls of WM to get the increased Crit range <br><br>So any suggestions what else i could add <br><br>So in a nut shell Dwarf duel wield Fighter/ WM / DWD plus maybe a decent Int and at least Overwhelming crit ? <br><br><br>not much <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">

If you take the ranger class dual wield feat, you don't need to have dex 15 to get the benefits of ambidexterity. You have to wear light armour though. <br>You can get up to +6 AC bonus from dex items, enough to "fill" the dex bonus of leather armour. With the defensive awareness feat of DwD you shouldn't be afraid of some dodge AC.<br>_________________<br>There are no facts, only interpretations.
