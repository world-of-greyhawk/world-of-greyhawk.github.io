Elf<br>Wizard 3<br>Monk 7<br>Pale Master 30<br><br>Final Stats (sorry, no longer have original)<br>No equipment whatsoever<br>Str 14<br>Dex 17<br>Con 12<br>Int 19<br>Wis 17<br>Cha 10<br><br>AC 38 (wearing no armor)<br>HP 290<br><br>AB: 23/20/17/14 (weilding no weapon)<br>Fort 24<br>Reflex 22<br>Will 28<br><br>Spells: All arcane levels 0 - 9, plus Epics: Mummy Dust, and Hellball<br><br>Skills:<br>Concentration 43<br>Discipline 18<br>Hide 25<br>Listen 28<br>Lore 37<br>Move Silently 28<br>Spellcraft 46<br>Tumble 19<br><br>Feats:<br>Animate Dead, Armor Skin, Blind-Fight, Bone Skin, Circle Kick, Cleave, Darkvision, Deathless Master Touch, Deathless Master, Deathless Vigor, Deflect Arrows, Dodge, Energy Resist: Cold I (10%); Electrical I (10%); Fire II (20%), Evasion, Flurry of Blows, Great Dex I, Great Str I, Great Wis I, Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Immune: Sleep, Improved Critical (unarmed strike), Improved Knockdown, Improved Unarmed Strike, Keen Sense, Knockdown, Low-light Vision, Mobility, Monk AC Bonus, Monk Speed, Point Blank Shot, Purity of Body, Rapid Reload, Scribe Scroll, Elven Skill Affinities, Spell Focus (Necro), Spring Attack, Still Mind, Stunning Fist,<br>Summon Familiar, Summon Greater Undead, Summon Undead, Tough as Bone, Undead Graft II, Weapon Profs (Monk, Elf, Wiz), Wholeness of Body<br><br><br>What I really see as the strengths of this character, as unenhanced by any equipment are:<br>- good AC 38 (naked, no stats enhanced, mind you)<br>- death touch x 3/day DC 27<br>- all arcane spells, with a decent spell slot allowance (enough to arm against any high level baddies in any situation)<br>- unarmed Monk combat skills (offensive and defensice)that can easily take on the vast majority of monsters<br>- Immunities: Critical Hits (PM), Disease (Monk), Stun (PM), hold (PM), paralyzation (PM)<br>- Summon Greater Undead, which at level 30 is Demi Lich, Wiz 21, that makes for a badass pet<br>- Undead Graft x 9/day (paralyze opponent)<br><br>With some fairly decent AC bonus robes and wis gear, this character's AC is 74, which is all but untouchable to any standard monster, and with an immunity to critical hits, few monsters are able to put up much of a fight. And take into consideration the good hide and move silently, this character is able to strike from the shadows and slink back into them with relative ease.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/26/08 07:54</span></i></p>

Why not human as a race instead of elf, to avoid the xp penalties in its playability??

Elves have wizard as their favored class - there is no experience penalty.<br><br>This character is a pretty sucky spellcaster - all his spells are considered as if they were cast by a lvl 3 wizard. The only spells he could use are those which don't depend on your level, but those usually have a saving throw - and his spell DC is low either.

Wouldn't your AC be 1 point higher if you left Wisdom at 16 and raised Dexterity to 18?<br><br>Also, since you're relying almost totally on your Demilich summon, maybe it would be more useful to take raise Constitution to 14 so you can take a few more hits.
