avado, true I did post asking for help to improve. . . one was to take more fighter to get more attacks(4) and another was to take AA. I am trying to get as balanced as it can be, which is difficult to say the least, hence only 3 attacks per round, and wanted melee so an AA, which would be good for range but get his butt kicked when the enemy closed the distance. And since those were the only two suggestions I decided to post here also. to the view points of people here.<br><br>Tks. for your observations tho.

If you are going to keep that class split, at least go Fighter 12/Wizard 8 in pre-epic for 4 APR.<br>Also, drop Parry (useles skill), Pick Pocket and Lore and invest in UMD and Set Trap.<br>_________________<br>"Hats off and applause to rogues and evolution"

My first question is whether you really really want Bastard Sword. The reason being is that you are a bit feat starved and using a feat for Exotic Weapons is a bit expensive. <br><br>Second, you really should be getting 4 APR in a spellsword build, it seems illogical not to, particularly when you can.<br><br>Craft Wand can not be taken on 25th level - not a feat I would really consider in this build anyway - too expensive for the slight return it gives you.<br><br>Spellswords are often feat starved and this is no exception - I would avoid taking Weapon Proficiency Exotic and opt for something else instead.	<br><br>Perhaps go Dwarf - quite a few benefits from this as a spellsword (extra HP, bonus to saves vs spells and poison, bonus vs Giants, Goblins and Orcs).<br><br>Go Illusionist rather than General School to benefit from the extra spell per level.<br><br>Combat Casting is a waste unless you are going to get Improved Combat Casting as well. However the usefulness of that is also questionable.<br><br>Perhaps finish your INT on 19 rather than 20 - you lose a 1st and 5th level spell - which has been regained by going Illusionist - you also lose 1 dc from your offensive spells - but this is too low anyway to be any serious threat, so no loss there.<br><br>In a +5 environment Epic Mage Armor only offers a bonus of 5 Dodge AC, rather than the 20 bonus listed (would be worth checking this as it may be considered and expensive feat).<br><br>Just as an example:<br><br>Dwarf<br>STR: 16 (26)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 18<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 16 (19)<br>CHA: 6<br><br>01: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Longsword, Power Attack<br>02: Fighter(2): Cleave<br>03: Fighter(3): Knockdown<br>04: Fighter(4): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Longsword<br>05: Illusionist(1): {Scribe Scroll}<br>06: Illusionist(2): Blind Fight<br>07: Illusionist(3)<br>08: Illusionist(4): STR+1<br>09: Illusionist(5): Still Spell, Extend Spell<br>10: Illusionist(6)<br>11: Illusionist(7)<br>12: Fighter(5): STR+1, Expertise<br>13: Fighter(6): Improved Critical: Longsword<br>14: Illusionist(8)<br>15: Illusionist(9): Improved Expertise<br>16: Illusionist(10): STR+1, Maximize Spell<br>17: Fighter(7)<br>18: Illusionist(11): Great Cleave<br>19: Illusionist(12)<br>20: Fighter(8): INT+1, Improved Knockdown<br>21: Illusionist(13): Great Strength I<br>22: Illusionist(14)<br>23: Fighter(9)<br>24: Fighter(10): INT+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword, Epic Weapon Specialization: Longsword<br>25: Illusionist(15): Great Intelligence I<br>26: Illusionist(16)<br>27: Illusionist(17): Great Strength II<br>28: Illusionist(18): STR+1<br>29: Illusionist(19)<br>30: Illusionist(20): Automatic Still Spell I, Automatic Still Spell II<br>31: Fighter(11)<br>32: Fighter(12): STR+1, Overwhelming Critical: Longsword<br>33: Illusionist(21): Automatic Still Spell III<br>34: Illusionist(22)<br>35: Illusionist(23): Epic Spell: Epic Warding<br>36: Fighter(13): STR+1, Epic Prowess<br>37: Fighter(14): Devastating Critical: Longsword<br>38: Illusionist(24)<br>39: Illusionist(25): Armor Skin<br>40: Rogue(1): STR+1<br><br>Hitpoints: 406<br>Skillpoints: 238<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 24/19/15<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +11, Poison: +2<br>BAB: 24<br>AB (max, naked): 36 (melee), 24 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 19/30<br>Spell Casting: Wizard(9)<br><br>Skillset:<br>Concentration 42(46)<br>Disable Trap 1(5)<br>Discipline 40(48)<br>Listen 43(42)<br>Lore 4(10)<br>Open Lock 1(0)<br>Search 1(5)<br>Spellcraft 41(45)<br>Tumble 40(39)<br>22 points leftover<br><br><b>Benefits:</b><br>Extend Spell	<br>Overwhelming Critical is available at 32nd rather than 36th	<br>You gain the 4 APR (5 with Haste)	<br>Dev Crit available at 37th (1 level earlier)	<br>Expertise/ Improved Expertise is available to boost your AC	<br>AB improved by 1	<br>Fort Save 3 points higher	<br>Fully Buffed AC 71 (when Imp Expertise active)<br><br>Not really sure how much the 1 rogue level really brings to the build apart from the 4 ac points from tumble.

@I...Samphus<br><br>There are some problems with your build you gave. 24 BAB still gives you only 3 APR (4 APR with haste); too much wizard levels pre-epic. Still, I do agree with you on most of your points, except for the feat starved part. For a spellsword build, Wizard-Fighter combinations have a ton of feats, enough to take almost all metamagic feats (quicken cannot be taken since you get 4 APR) and a lot of effective combat feats (unlike its pally-sorc counterpart, which is insanely feat starved).<br><br>As for expertise, I wouldn't take it if I don't take ICC too. i doubt you'd be using expertise while meleeing away with that AB.<br><br>Still, I'd have to agree with you on most points. I'd drop exotic weapon proficiency, combat casting and (personally) epic mage armor. Also, as much as possible, get all pre-epic available feats pre-epic. <br><br>Going two-handed seems to be a good choice, since you have considerably high strength. Also, I'd take the complete set of metamagic feats (with few precious spells available, make them all count - Maxed IGMS, Empowered Spell Mantles, Extended Bigby's, etc.), and  spell penetration feats (also to make your no-save spells as effective as possible). with 25 levels + Epic spell penetration, you can almost perfectly beat toolset SR (32).<br><br>Here is an example, maybe it could help <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Race: Human<br><br>STR: 16 (26)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 16<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 16 (19)<br>CHA: 8<br><br>01: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus, Power Attack, Cleave<br>02: Illusionist(1): {Scribe Scroll}<br>03: Illusionist(2): Spell Penetration<br>04: Illusionist(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>05: Illusionist(4)<br>06: Illusionist(5): Still Spell, Extend Spell<br>07: Illusionist(6)<br>08: Illusionist(7): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>09: Illusionist(8): Greater Spell Penetration<br>10: Fighter(2): Knockdown<br>11: Fighter(3)<br>12: Fighter(4): STR+1, Empower Spell, Weapon Specialization, (STR=19)<br>13: Fighter(5)<br>14: Fighter(6): Improved Knockdown<br>15: Fighter(7): Maximize Spell<br>16: Fighter(8): STR+1, Improved Critical, (STR=20)<br>17: Fighter(9)<br>18: Fighter(10): Toughness, Great Cleave<br>19: Fighter(11)<br>20: Fighter(12): STR+1, Blind Fight, (STR=21)<br>21: Illusionist(9): Epic Weapon Focus<br>22: Illusionist(10): Epic Spell Penetration<br>23: Illusionist(11)<br>24: Illusionist(12): INT+1, Great Strength I, (STR=22), (INT=17)<br>25: Illusionist(13)<br>26: Illusionist(14)<br>27: Illusionist(15): Great Strength II, Great Intelligence I, (STR=23), (INT=18)<br>28: Illusionist(16): INT+1, (INT=19)<br>29: Illusionist(17)<br>30: Illusionist(18): Automatic Still Spell I<br>31: Illusionist(19)<br>32: Illusionist(20): STR+1, Automatic Still Spell II, (STR=24)<br>33: Illusionist(21): Automatic Still Spell III<br>34: Illusionist(22)<br>35: Illusionist(23): Epic Spell: Epic Warding<br>36: Illusionist(24): STR+1, Overwhelming Critical, (STR=25)<br>37: Fighter(13)<br>38: Illusionist(25)<br>39: Fighter(14): Devastating Critical, Epic Weapon Specialization<br>40: Rogue(1): STR+1, (STR=26)<br><br><br>Hitpoints: 406<br>Skillpoints: 277<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 23/19/15<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9<br>BAB: 26<br>AB (max, naked): 37 (melee), 25 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 17/28<br><br>SKILLS:<br><br>Concentration 42(45)<br>Discipline 42(50)<br>Spellcraft 41(45)<br>Tumble 40(39)<br>UMD 41(40)<br><br>63 Points free<br><br>If you're not going to take UMD, get a monk or bard level instead.

@ avado<br><br>The build posts were not hijacks. They were builds provided as examples to get the point across with further clarity. I figured, since he did take the suggestions from his previous post into consideration, and he still didn't get the 4 attacks per round, maybe an example on how to get 4 attacks per round using his current class distribution would possibly make things much more clear for him. Hmm.. just maybe..<br><br>Since it was intended as such and the examples themselves were merely minor tweaks of the topic starter's build, I thought that I should post it in this thread for the sake of continuity of the topic, rather than claiming the idea to my own. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif"> <br><br>@ stonebreaker<br><br>you should provide descriptions on what you actually aim to do with your build, so that other guild members can help you attain your actual goal, so that we need not place builds all over the place that show what we think should be modified on your build, lest we be frowned upon by the epic character builder's guild. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">   <br><br>P.S.
