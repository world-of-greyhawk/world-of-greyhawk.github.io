This is an old build of mine that I dusted off and polished up a bit and found I liked the result. There are a handful of these posted, but I think mine's just different enough to add to the pile. For one thing, I don't chase maximum STR or Dev Crit with this build, and I take both Divine Might and Divine Shield as well as several useful metamagic feats instead of a couple of Song feats. One thing I'd suggest right out of the gate is (depending on your environment) taking Curse Song over Empower Spell, though.<br><br>Sorry, no back story for this one, as it has only ever been a 'build' and not a real character concept.<br><br>CLC 15/Bard 15/RDD 10<br><br>Suggested domains are War and Strength<br><br>Human, any alignment<br><br><b>Playable from 1 to 40, PvM</b><br><br>STR 14 (30)<br>DEX 10<br>CON 14 (16)<br>INT 12 (14)<br>WIS 14 (18)<br>CHA 14 (18)<br><br>1 )Bard1: Martial Weapons/ Power Attack<br>2 )Bard2<br>3 )CLC1: Weapon Focus:Greatsword<br>4 )CLC2: STR (15)<br>5 )CLC3<br>6 )CLC4: Divine Might<br>7 )Bard3<br>8 )RDD1: STR (16)<br>9 )RDD2: Extend Spell<br>10)RDD3<br>11)RDD4<br>12)Bard4: Empower Spell/ STR (21)<br>13)CLC5<br>14)CLC6<br>15)CLC7: Divine Shield<br>16)CLC8: STR (22)<br>17)Bard5<br>18)Bard6: Still Spell<br>19)Bard7<br>20)Bard8: CHA (15)<br><br>21)RDD5: Epic Weapon Focus:Greatsword<br>22)Bard9<br>23)RDD6<br>24)RDD7: Epic Prowess/ CHA (16)<br>25)RDD8<br>26)RDD9<br>27)RDD10: GRT STR I (27)<br>28)Bard10: WIS (15)<br>29)CLC9<br>30)CLC10: GRT STR II (28)<br>31)CLC11<br>32)Bard11: WIS (16)<br>33)CLC12: GRT WIS (17)<br>34)CLC13<br>35)CLC14<br>36)CLC15: Armor Skin/ WIS (18)<br>37)Bard12<br>38)Bard13<br>39)Bard14: GRT STR III (29)<br>40)Bard15: STR (30)<br><br>AB: +39<br><br>Maximum HPs: 414<br><br>Naked AC: 24 (33 in full plate with Cat's)<br><br>Saves (vs spells)[Bard Song]<br>Fort: 25 (34)[36]<br>Refl: 19 (28)[30]<br>Will: 30 (39)[41]<br><br>Skills (265 points):<br>Lore: 8<br>UMD: 42<br>Tumble: 40<br>Perform: 21<br>Discipline: 43<br>Spellcraft: 42<br>Concentration: 43<br>Taunt: 26<br><br>Without any magic items at all he can:<br><br>Boost AB to the +20 cap easily:<br>+2 Bard Song<br>+5 Grtr Magic Weapon<br>+5 Divine Power (adds another attack as well)<br>+5 Divine Favor<br>+1 Bless<br>+1 Aid<br>+2 Battletide<br>+4 War Domain power<br><br>That easily overruns the cap right there.<br><br>Also, he can boost his STR with Empowered Bull's (+3 to +7) and STR Domain power (+7) for a possible further +6 to AB.

i really like the charisma abilities that this class combo gets.  seems to be an afterthought for so many other builds.  just makes for some greater versatility, and +39 AB for a 3/4 AB build is alright.<br><br>nicely done.  sounds like fun to play, especially when you have a good spellcaster and/or archer to back you up.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Perception is strong and sight weak.

I like cleric and red dragon disciple builds and this one is not the ordinary. The focus of this build makes it very unusual and therefore unique. This build has some great abilities and considering you had little feats to choose from you done well. But I ask is there any point in taking still spell if you need the full level of spells that you have? Nicely done though.

Try starting with 12 CON and 14 INT instead.<br><br>That will net you 40+ skill points. I say plus because of the 1st level skill point calculation changes based on INT.
