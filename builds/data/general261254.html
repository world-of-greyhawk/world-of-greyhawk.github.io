On the server I play on some weapons that have been let loose have 1d12 bonus damage pierce and bludge as a slashing weapon.<br><br>I was looking into damage resistence as a way to possibly counter this but it seems that even though they arent bonus slashing damage the game melds them all together and only prevents your highest resistence i.e. if im wearing a greater swordsman belt and have 10/ bludge and pierce somewhere else only the /20 gets added into the resistence, the same holds true for damage immunities, all three damages seem to meld into the base damage of the weapon.<br><br>Can anyone confirm this or know of a way to help stop it less than a 30 level dd?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By sarge525 on 12/20/06 21:44</span></i></p>

Sure, 26 levels of Dwarven defender instead of 30 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  Hey you got something against DWD? it's quite a strong class.<br><br>You can also take 15 PM or 21 Wizard for Epic Warding.<br><br>Now really, to answer your question, I'm not very sure about it, I know that different types of damages work exactly for that, avoiding DRs, so piercing and slashing weapons like scythe or halberd are harder to resist, but I'm no expert about it, I do use a lot of DWD, so it just absorbs everything, I never wear DR equipment, always DWD or spells.

A DwD Risen Lord would work wonders. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>(You should have seen my Shifter post coming.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  )<br><br>Risen Lord has 50% damage reduction against Slash and Pierce.  Add that to their 15/+3 or the DwD DR and you'll be hard to damage.  Not to mention being crit and sneak immune.<br><br>Just don't poke your stick at a high level Cleric or you'll be turned.
