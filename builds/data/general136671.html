Hey guys...i just checked out the link to servers in this guild and i found none. I am sorta surprised <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif"> <br><br>If you all would like me to, I can try to set up a server for our guild. You guys could test your builds in the server and show the rest of the members what your builds can do. I have a 2nd computer that I do not use, but It used to be a NWN server that would run 24/7. If you all would like me to, I can hook it up again for you all. I only will do this if you guys would like me to.<br><br><br>Just an idea...

If you have shops you should make this items basic so you can test characters, not nessarily items.  Something like making armor/weapon plain +5/+10/+20 items and make belts with +12 attribute items etc etc.  Then you can test builds as they would work on various servers.

Most of the servers that I have been on don't allow epic characters like we build, so it is hard to find a good server to test the builds. So go ahead and set up one for all of us who want to test the characters.

Alrighty then...<br><br>Well...I just moved into a smaller place just recently so I'm still unpacking things and finding it hard to place things in a more condensed space. I probably will have my other comp's server up and running soon. If someone can help me in making a module that would be great for testing builds, please post here or send me a private message. <br><br>My 2nd comp should be up and running within the week if i can. Ill post here and in the Server's registry soon.

Alrighty....I think I'm almost ready to have the server up and running with my other comp. Now i just need some help...<br><br>I am not the world's greatest module creator (actually, I'm in 84,306th place out of the 83,003 people <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif"> ) Like posted before, I need a module thatll be perfect for testing builds (strips all items when entering, basic stores with all types of basic weapons/armor, and dueling zone). If someone(s) could please post the mod here, please do so soon. My other comp is almost ready...

Ok, my 2nd computer is ready for action! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I am still hoping someone(s) can create a mod that would be perfect for testing epic builds. <br><br>Alright...now for the fun part...<br><br>I am using a router. My first comp can't connect to it if i select my server from gamespy. If i directly connect to it, it works. I need some people to test and see if my server works or not.<br><br>In gamespy, go to Action Channel. The name of the Server is "Epic Build Server". There is no password for logging in as a player. It is running Chapter 1 from the original campaign. <br><br>If that works, please post here and tell me that the link from gamespy works.<br><br>If not, try directly connecting to my server.<br><br>192.168.0.5:5121<br><br>If it works or not, please post ur results here. If I get positive feedback, I'll post the server in the Guild's servers. If you would all like, i'll make it password safe to ensure that there are no outsiders that will ruin your epic build tests.<br><br>Please check asap. My server will be up all night.

So is anyone else showing up on the server?  I've gone on a few times, and generally go on whenever I see someone is in there.  Perhaps if we scheduled some sort of tournamet or a "server warming" party or something <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
