Here is a Mage build that is different from the normal IGMS, Bigby, Nukers that I normally play.  There are a couple of builds with similar class combos, but not the same Spell Focus(es).<br><br>Dark Possessor - Wizard 37 / ShadowDancer 3<br><b>Playable 1-40, PvM</b><br><br>Human (though most races could work)<br>Use Neutral alignment so that Protection from Alignment won't affect your spells<br><br>Str. 14<br>Dex. 14<br>Con. 14<br>Int. 16 (36) (all stat bumps go here)<br>Wis. 10<br>Cha. 8<br><br><br>1 Wizard - Combat Casting, Spell Focus, Enchantment<br>2 Wizard<br>3 Wizard - Greater Spell Focus, Enchantment<br>4 Wizard<br>5 Wizard - Spell Penetration<br>6 Wizard - Spell Focus: Necromancy<br>7 Wizard<br>8 Wizard<br>9 Wizard - Greater Spell Focus: Necromancy<br>10 Wizard - Greater Spell Penetration<br>11 Wizard<br>12 Wizard - Dodge<br>13 Wizard<br>14 Wizard<br>15 Wizard - Mobility, Empower Spell<br>16 Wizard<br>17 Wizard<br>18 ShadowDancer - Stealthy<br>19 Wizard<br>20 Wizard<br><br>21 Wizard - Epic Spell Focus: Enchantment, Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy<br>22 Wizard<br>23 Wizard<br>24 Wizard - Great Intelligence I, Great Intelligence II<br>25 Wizard<br>26 Wizard<br>27 Wizard - Great Intelligence III, Great Intelligence IV<br>28 Wizard<br>29 Wizard<br>30 ShadowDancer - Great Intelligence V<br>31 Wizard, Great Intelligence VI<br>32 Wizard<br>33 Wizard - Epic Warding<br>34 Wizard - Great Intelligence VII<br>35 Wizard<br>36 Wizard - Great Intelligence VIII<br>37 ShadowDancer<br>38 Wizard - Great Intelligence IX<br>39 Wizard - Great Intelligence X<br>40 Wizard<br><br>AB 21<br>AC 20<br><br>Fortitude 18<br>Reflex 20<br>Will 21<br><br>Skills: Max Concentration and Spellcraft during Wizard levels, Max Hide, Move Silently and Tumble during Shadowdancer levels.  You will have quite a few skill points to throw around in whatever suits your fancy (perhaps Search)<br><br>This build is more successful on mods and PW's  that don't have as many immunity items (low magic). High Magic worlds would make this build less than ideal.<br><br>Tactics:  Use invisibility or stealth to scout  out an area. Find the biggest low-will tank character and cast Dominate Person (or monster, depending) and quickly drop out of site (HiPS).  While the tank starts ripping into his companions and distracting them, use your death spells (finger of Death, Wail) to pick off the low-Fort spellcasters and/or Rogues.  Deal quickly with any Mages or Cleric/Druids that have True-sight.  If you don't want to waste a high level Death Spell, you could use Blindness (fort save) to blind the mages and let your Dominated tank take care of them.  As your tanks get killed by his companions, dominate a new one and watch the fun ensue again.<br><br>Even though you have access to Invisibility spells and/or a Wand of Invisibility, I find it invaluable to be able to activate HiPS immediately after casting a spell. If you feel you need HiPS sooner, take  a level of Rogue at 7 to get your Hide, Tumble  and Move Silently skills where they need to be. You will also have to adjust your Feats to get Dodge and Mobility earlier as well. It shouldn't affect the final outcome too much.<br><br>This build is designed around a player that wants to play around with tactics.  While it has it's share of IGMS, Fireballs, ect., it is not geared for that kind of play.  It seems to work best solo, but could definately work in party play as well.  With the high Intelligence, you can cross class a few skills to complement yourself (Search, Open Lock, etc.). <br><br>It works in the leveler, and I had a fun time with it running through HoTU.<br><br>Weaknesses:  Fighting anything that is immune to Death Magic and Mind-affecting can be problematic.  But you can simply fall back, adjust your spells for pure damage (IGMS, Bigby, Flame Arrow, etc), and proceed as normal.  Also, with a low AC and a low Discipline, try to stay away from meleers that are going to Dev. Crit/Knockdown/etc.  Of course, HiPS, will help with that.<br><br>Usefull spells per level (based on Spell Foci):<br>1) Ray of Enfeeblement, Sleep<br>2) Blindness, Ghoul Touch<br>3) Hold Person, Vampiric Touch<br>4) Confusion, Fear<br>5) Dominate Person, Hold Monster<br>6) Circle of Death, Undeath to Death<br>7) Control Undead, Finger of Death<br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif">   Horrid Wilting<br>9) Dominate Monster, Wail of the Banshee<br><br>Cheers.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 10/14/05 13:52</span></i></p>

I love this kind of tactic.  I used to play a full-pvp MUD where I liked to use a wizard/rogue style character to sneak up on people, forcibly turn them against each other with domination-style spells, then kill them off with direct damage spells and backstabs.  It worked great.<br><br>In fact the only thing I'd like better than this build was one with a lot of rogue levels for sneak attacking, but then the casting wouldn't work nearly as well... darn spell resistance <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

It looks as if I could take Bard at 7, SD at 8, then Bard again at 17, 27, and 37.  This would give me a great class to dump points into (UMD, Discipline, Hide, MS, Tumble, etc).  <br><br>I will need to run it through the leveler to make sure I won't be  loosing any epic feats.  If so, I may have to take the remaining Bard levels at 22 and then 37.  That's a pretty big gap between them for bumping my Hide and Move Silently skills, though.  I'll test it out to see if I am spotted easily.<br><br>Great idea, though.  Thanks.

a person on my server always runs out and dominates the biggest baddest melee monster on the server, then tears everyone else up.

Great concept! I like it! The puppets master, pulling the strings from the shadows...<br><br>A few considerations, you could max INT losing points in STR &amp; CON. It is a big sacrifice but then you can free up 2 GREAT INT feats for epic skills focii (like hide &amp; move silently) since your DEX is low, it might be usefull. Or you can even keep your Great INT feats and raise your spell DC by 1, always handy.<br><br>On the other hand I don't know how HIPS &amp; Improved invisibility interact: are you invisible again (meaning indetectable without TS) or hidden or "invisible but detected" (translucent)?<br><br>And with the same question, you could switch combat casting for what you want (maximized, thoughness, lightning reflex...) since most of the time you will cast from a distance or be hidden/invisible.<br><br>aquamoeba
