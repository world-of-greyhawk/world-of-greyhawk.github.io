Playable (1-40) PvM or PvP<br><br><br>SONG BLADE (the “Fighting Bard”)<br>By Deborah Tyr<br><br>IS THE SONG STRONGER THAN THE SWORD?<br><br>Concept: Based on the tale of King Arthur, and Celtic lore, this character, the Song Blade, is the third and final character in my “Fighting Bard” Series, which is in answer to the following question: what happens when a talented musician goes off to knight school? Until now we have focused on “the Sword” – i.e., exceptional strength and the power of devastating critical, through the Curse Blade and Blade. This variant, Song Blade, focuses on “the Song”.<br><br>Blade is essentially a PG delight, having an unbuffed BAB 30, AB +52 and Dev. Crit. DC 42 (AB +78, +6 Taunt (or, AB 84) &amp; a DC 48 capped), with the Curse being a bit more balanced as between the Bardic theme and Dev. Crit power. The Curse has access to some bard spells, a slightly better bard song and much earlier access to UMD/scrolls and other skills, as compared to Blade; this comes at a cost, however. While the Curse has a rather impressive combat presence, it is not as powerful as that of Blade, so far as the Curse’s stats come in at an unbuffed BAB 29, AB +50 with a Dev. Crit. DC 41 (AB +76, +6 Taunt (or, AB 82) &amp; a DC 47 capped).  These builds represent “the Sword” (links to each are below).<br><br>Here, in this build, we turn our attention instead to the “song” such that, accordingly, the Song Blade does not have dev. crit. In lieu of this ability, we are able to focus more on the bardic charms per se, and thus attain a better bard song/curse song, with much better spell access and other neat bard tricks as compared to the sword variants, and including early UMD/scroll access. This in turn is designed to produce a highly versatile, and fun-filled character while, at the same time, not neglecting our combat presence, which is in keeping with the focus of this series: i.e., the Fighting Bard.  <br><br>I hope everyone enjoys the Song Blade, as much as the other variants in this series. This build should in particular appeal to those playing on a server where dev. crit is not allowed and/or to those who would like to get in on the legend and fun, but who wish to do so with even “more bard”. As always, I welcome everyone’s great comments on this build, and thank everyone once again for all your ongoing advice, ideas, and kind praises throughout my latest series: thank you, and enjoy! ~ Tyr<br><br>For the Sword variants (and to see a pertinent list of recommended UMD/scrolls, as well as appropriate credits to all who commented/helped out <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      :<br>* The Curse Blade <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "246390", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>         <br>* The Blade <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "246241", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br><br><br>SONG BLADE (the “Fighting Bard”) -- Overview<br>Fighter(10), Bard(11), Weapon Master(19)<br>Race: Human /  Alignment: Neutral Good Preferred(or any non-lawful)<br><br>FINAL STATS:<br>STR: 14 (28)<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 14<br><br>Hitpoints: 476 (+8 Bard Song)<br><br><br>Saving Throws: <br>Fort: 25 +1 Song<br>Will: 21 (23 Owl’s) +1 Song<br>Reflex: 24 (26 Cat’s) +1 Song<br><br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4<br><br>Other Enhancements:<br>+2 Saves &amp; Immunity to Mind-Effects (Protection)<br>+1 Saves (Resistance)<br><br>Note: also has full access to UMD/scrolls, enabling your Song Blade to self-buff all stats, saving throws, AB/damage, and AC (for recommended list please see Curse Blade (link above).<br><br><br><br>* COMBAT VITALS:<br>AB: 29, AB: +46/41/36/31 (NO Buffs)<br>+2 Bull’s Strength <br>+3 Greater Magic Weapon<br>-- <br>Effective AB: +51/46/41/36 (11-plus hours)<br><br>Other Enhancements:<br>+2 Bard Song<br>+2 War Cry<br>+6 Taunt (lowers enemy AC and, in effect, raises your AB)<br>+2 Curse Song (as above, raises AB by lowering enemy AC)<br>--<br>Total AB: +63/58/53/48<br><br><br>Capped AB (Assuming +12 STR &amp; +20 Weaponry/UMD/Spells): <br>+72/67/62/57<br>+2 Curse Song<br>+6 Taunt<br>--<br>Total : +80/75/70/65 <br><br><br>* DAMAGE (Mundane Longsword):<br>1-8 +15 (15-20 crit./x3) (13-20/x3 w.

I'm not sure I'd claim to be "focusing on the song" with 11 levels in Bard...you barely even start to get the AC bonus with that.<br><br>If you like this concept (and are set on WM levels), I might consider the same class combination, but going Bard 12/Fighter 3/WM 5 pre-epic (a little feat-starved, but doable since your fighter levels give you all the proficiencies you need), then finishing up Bard 20/Fighter 4/WM 16 at 40, taking WS and EWS on a general feat level with Fighter 4, then taking Lasting Inspiration at 39 with your 20th Bard level.<br><br>Following that path, your AB drops by 3 (2 BAB, 1 lost WM AB), but your enemies lose 3 more AC from your Curse Song (which now knocks off a whopping 5 and lasts 10 times longer), so your AB breaks even.  Your AC increases by the same 3 (and benefits from the increased duration), you get level 6 Bard spells, your party loves you because you're a Lasting bard, and you get more skill points.  Your HP are really the only thing that suffer significantly, as well as perhaps pre-epic feat selection.

Hello, Nimueh, and thanks for the comment. Interestingly, I had another version, a 4th character in the works to be added to the series, a lasting bard (ie., 20 levels), and thus, a nice party assistant as you suggest, but having just gotten back from a nice retreat if you will to find the boards filled with many nice bards with the high, sweeter songs, well, I decided against posting him at this time <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">      <br><br>As such, this series instead focuses on front-line warriors, high melee characters, or "Fighting Bards" - with which I broke out of the box, away from the stereotypical bard role, to focus instead on real combat power. Bard as tank, if you will, yet with all that great utility, versatility and arcane touch that is unmistakably bard (this, so as not to get boxed in the stereotype that is tank either <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">     <br><br>Whereas the other two are dev critters, this one's more bard; here, we get a much better bard song, and much better spell access than in the other two, and hence my calling this more of a song focus, as compared to the other two. <br><br>We could go with even more bard/song here, but it would come at a cost of his combat focus - in order to get to level 6 spells, for example, he'd in addition to loss of WM/FTR levels (and AB as you've noted), have to bring up cha in lieu of str, and thus BAB/AB would in turn suffer ie., from BAB 29/AB 45 sleeping naked and having the ability to dish out some very good damage with all that great WM stuff, to a mediocre AB somewhere in the vicinity of BAB 27/AB 39 and loss of damage; while this would make for a nice party assistant, it wouldn't unfortunately qualify for the "fighting bard" label. <br><br>True, buffs etc. would be available to such a lasting bard, but they're nerfable in PvP; Song Blade's stats instead are natural; we're NOT relying on spells etc. to bring 'em up, such that he's not nerfable (although, having the ability to fully self-buff essentially everything to cap, with a capped AB 71 (w. +6 taunt &amp; +2 curse, or AB 79)...  <br><br>Then, I do hears ya: I pity the poor party that doesn't have a qualified lasting bard on hand as an assistant, which in light of our strong combat focus here, neither the Song Blade (nor the other two, i.e., sword variants) qualifies for; however, as combat warriors with the fun, versatility and arcane flavor of the bard, they may not be your background minstrel, but all readily fly solo and also serve any party good from the front lines.<br><br>Because we're not limited in terms of choices due to dev crit, Song Blade is the most versatile of the three, and is in keeping with my general philosophy of balance i.e. between ftr/wm combat prowess &amp; bard versatility; this enables him, in the event of a real emergency, to step into the party's ministrel's shoes, if so required, while at all times fighting hand-to-hand and toe-to-toe from the front lines (in which case, even though his song may be sweet, your point is an excellent one, and all the more reason for him to quickly take out the other side's bard, yes? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">      <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">      <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      <br><br>~ Tyr<br><br>p.s. notwithstanding all the wonderful high bard/lasters out there as of late, and in light of Nim's comment (thanks!), if there's enough interest in the community for yet another 'fighting bard' with even more bard for the sweeter and lasting song, lemme know, and I'll be happy to post what we might call the performing musician who ultimately decided to quit knight school <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/22/06 07:35</span></i></p>

edit: "*IF* there's enough interest for another high/lasting bard..." duh! What am I saying? OF COURSE there is <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">           OK, one more, one more knight in da fighting bard series, a laster will follow, I've one more on the comp, focussed even more on the song, but using Champion of Torm instead of weapon master (this, to gets to BAB 27/AB +41 with level 6 spell access and the higher curse/bard song, with lots more feats, too, to make up for the loss of AB/WM damage factor - OK, not the front-line-and centre tank-bard as are these three, but still, a fighting minstrel who can hold his own nevertheless, with great spell access and some neat bard tricks, including a lasting, sweeter song. <br><br>Now that we focussed and thoroughly explored the sword, namely a PG sword build, a versatile sword build, and this one, the Song Blade, who is essentially a nice mid-way point between the sword &amp; the song (but still combat/melee focussed, a singing tank if you will, that's fun and playable, having some really nice spells and great UMD versatility),...It's time me thinks to check out what *more* "song" would look like. The musician who went to knight school, but subsequently returned to his first love, that of musical composition and the song. Love it! Thanks, Nimueh: feelin' inspired <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">           <br><br>Stay tuned folks (yer about to gets another fighting bard, such that there's sure to be one to suit everyone who wants to get in on the legend and fun - cool! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">      ~ Tyr<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/22/06 10:19</span></i></p>

This version also got level 5 and 6 spells, allowing him to use War Cry for a further +2 AB (although that does go toward the cap).<br><br>As for capped AB, the +42 version gets to precisely the same as yours (42+20 enhancement+6 taunt+5 curse) and the +43 version gets one higher.<br><br>It's true that buff-dependant AB is less reliable than unbuffed AB, but I think such effects are minimized when your buffs/debuffs last 15 minutes and you can use them 20 times/day.  And even if it is a problem...is the loss of 2 or 3 AB really enough to keep the build from being a Fighting Bard?<br><br>Having just checked out your Sling Blade, by the way, it's an admirable alternative...and I'd still call it a Fighting Bard <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  .

Yeah, I likes 'em bards (they get the best toys, don't they?!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    Hey, Grim: thanks, and good to be back!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Mith: fabulous idea re: stats; you’re right, unbuffed BAB 29/AB +46 (sleeping naked) (AB +72, +6 Taunt &amp; +2 Curse, or AB +80 capped) sounds darn good (hey, he can cast owl's, protection and clarity - great thinkin' -- as always <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">     (I'll PM those changes soon, thanks!).<br><br>As to the split, went this route for a fun, solid meleer w. spell access for utility and more balance. The swords (curse blade and blade) are high warriors/low bards, dev. critters, w. attendant high combat stats; here, we have a nice meleer with more bard for more versatility, including war cry. This guy also gets a decent bard song/curse song; yes, 16-plus bard permits more AC boost (i.e., +/-5, instead of the +/-2 we get here). But the AB boost on this guys song is the same as a higher bard (i.e, +/-2). Also, something to be said for war cry, as Nimueh points out: with war cry, for eg., +2 AB &amp; damage boost, &amp; enemies who fail their will saves stricken with fear. Seemed a nice trade off at the time (then, what trade off? we’re gonna get an extra AB &amp; damage point while, at the same time, keep our war cry and the better song thanks to Mith – Cool! (thank you again, Mith! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br><br>As to the Sling Blade, our epic fighting bard with the sweet, lasting song, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "247650", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Nimueh: thanks for the compliment; might say I felt inspired to load em up &amp; make him even stronger for ya (hmm, looks pretty much like a fighting bard <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  a laster with decent, buffable (and adjustable) combat AB (when all is said and done, can achieve +80 capped), other tricks, and without any significant HP loss or feat-loss (note: for sure, I share your zest for WM but had we stuck with WM to build the Sling instead of switching to COT, we would have been forced to choose between AB &amp; HPs, so went with COT on him to avoid that; plus gets him some extra feats and divine wrath stuff, which makes up for some of the loss of AB/damage as compared to this build) (thanks!)<br><br>That said, there are many melee players out there who aren’t comfortable w. buffs; to know the bard and his/her song is to love the bard, I agree; still, there's stuff out there with the power of dispel (and bards be one of ‘em <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">    ) Of course, when you can curse ‘em, mind fog ‘em, war cry ‘em (and/or use KD/IKD to knock ‘em), they can’t really hurt or sling at you, … <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   Still, ...<br><br><br>But bards – just give us so much to sing about! (Thanks everyone) ~ Tyr <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>BTW, as to the characters in this series, if it’s the power of dev. crit you’re looking for &amp; ye be interested in the bard theme, check out Curse Blade (link at top); if it’s just power you really want, then you be seekin’ Blade (link also above). If, however, it’s a melee'r with some nice bard flavor you prefer, then look no further, as you’ve found your Song Blade. On the other hand, if you be wanting a lasting bard who can fight, then that’d be Sling Blade you seek (see, above).        <br><br>p.s. Grim &amp; Mith: er, pally, bard, drake . . . but, uh, uh, …. these be fighting bards, none of ‘em have…um, um, wings (er, is it *that* obvious? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">     (too funny!) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/24/06 10:10</span></i></p>
