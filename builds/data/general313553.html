Question is why would a monk say that is a dex monk thats lets say 20 level large get 1d20 damage ever use a kama even duel weilded except another attack perhaps ...when kama does only 1d6? <br><br>I know get a kama suppose :<br><br>+5 kama flame weapon on it not sure keen one?<br>one for the other hand<br>get another strike with improved weapons and such <br><br>Put all my points into dex, left my wisdom around 16 now is it worth going now more dex and pick up all the weapon feats for duel wielding?<br><br>just handy to have wehn you travel with a strong mage?<br><br>thanks sorry not play monks much trying to wrap my head around the idea.<br><br>why take 4 fighter levels before 20 to get the extra attacks and how effective the kamas are to your bare hands?<br><br>Leave it to the monks of the world to enlighten this darken soul<br><br>thanks.<br>Raven

If you have access to +7 kamas or better the average damage is better than the d20 from unarmed because gloves tend to have +X AB only, not the bonus to attack and damage kamas have. I have seen gloves that were haked to give a proper enhancement bonus though.

Kamas are buffable, dual wieldable, don't waste a gear slot (gloves/bracers), can benefit from the keen property, have an enchantment bonus rather than just an attack one and in a +5 plus some elemental damage environment and a reasonable availability of scrolls or in a party generally deal more damage output than unarmed.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

Foe arguement sake lets go with the fact that monk is a pure monk no umd no caster with him and such. Leaves him with 1d20 hand ,most servers seen try to limit the monk.

You wont have any real damage output, so you really need to use str with fists!  Look at it this way: A PURE str Half Orc RDD would have a BASE of 44 str and with +12 gear, 56!  This means EVERY hit with his WHIP (d3) or DAGGER (d4) HITS for +23+die roll!  What you describe with your dex monk with fists is 1-20+3!

Regularly kamas are taken by multiclassed builds with low amount of Monk levels, so kama can take all the advantages of Monk's APR progression with all the regular advantages of having a weapon such as buffing and such, as easy as that. Why would a level 20 Monk use kamas? I suppose they regularly don't do so.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Okay okay Avado(sorry hope that right post alot read them but late and tired) think got it like to sway to the fist side of things. This is more personal choice and i know certain builds rock others. Guess what is my concern hate to see say well had kamas be doing like twice as mucha nd more attacks and man you sure were out to lunch making this character good with that. Sure the paranoid response we all fear.<br><br>So this where its at then.<br>server is low magic somwhat nothing over +3 , most monk items there are none. Some super uber monk came and ripped through and pretty much abolished all monk stuff to follow for sake balance. I know yuck. But up to the challenge to compete.<br><br>so start increasing wisdom nice take awile and by time reach that level maybe need the +5 . <br><br>does the fighter levels even matter at this point to increase anything can just still go straight monk...now think about it can I take great wisdom as a monk?<br><br>now seeing that strength comment too yeha see where strength build works to a monks favor <br><br>raven

Str monks won't get the same high AC as dexer or stunner (wis based) monks, but it is still quite good compared to other strength based builds, especially in high levels and when you can buff dex and wis. <br><br>A typical greatsword-wielding lvl 40 figher in mundane gear will have an AC of 25 if tumble is cross classed and 29 with skilldump from a tumble class.<br>If you add a towershield you get 28 and 32.<br>A str monk of lvl 40 (with dex 14 and wis 14) in mundane robes will have AC 32<br><br>A figher can get shield AC on the shield, something the monk won't have access to.<br>But the monk can get extra AC from increasing dex and wis with items and potions.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

A dex based monk won't do much damage but he'll be insanely hard to kill.  A strength based monk will lose a good chunk of AC, yes, especially on a lower magic server.

When i got into this guild way back when, i was looking for the soloable character!   Party players are fine, but i used to play at hours where noone else was on.  I HATED long fights as the longer they go on, the longer they go on (with regen and stuff).  There is nothing wrong with dexer monks, as long as there are damage sources.  Hitting for 1 point just doesnt get me excited to play!

By default, those gloves will not pierce 10/+3 reduction, but Ki Strike +3 will.

The attack bonus on gloves(+2 on your exampl) does penetrate DR. So if you can get +5 gloves there's no need to get KI strike at all.
