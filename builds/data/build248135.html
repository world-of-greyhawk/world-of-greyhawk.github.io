I've noticed it's hard to find a ranged sneaker (and I mean not a simple Rogue using a bow, he needs high AB), of course, I understand it's harder to sneak on ranged than melee, but it's potentially a great ally on any party, get a melee to cover you while you sneak from afar with good AB, and you can kill very fast. There are some Rogue/Wizard/AA with very similar class levels, (i.e <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "122140", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Rogue19/Wizard2/AA19 by Zhoreb</a> which has exact class levels) but none take ISA like mine, so this one makes a much more deadly sneak attack, I try to balance high AB and high sneak attack power, regrdless of how little damage he can sustain, that's why he's more of a party guy.<br><br>Playable Levels: 1-40<br>PvM, untested PvP<br><br>Alignment: Any<br><br>Elf<br><br>Abilities:<br>STR 10<br>DEX 20 (32)<br>CON 12<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8<br><br>1 Rogue1 - Point Blank Shot<br>2 Rogue2<br>3 Rogue3 - Rapid Shot<br>4 Rogue4 - DEX +1 (21)<br>5 Rogue5<br>6 Rogue6 - Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>7 Rogue7<br>8 Rogue8 - DEX +1 (22)<br>9 Wizard1 - Called Shot<br>10 Arcane Archer1<br>11 Arcane Archer2<br>12 Arcane Archer3 - DEX +1 (23), Improved Critical: Longbow<br>13 Arcane Archer4<br>14 Arcane Archer5<br>15 Arcane Archer6 - Blind-Fight<br>16 Arcane Archer7 - DEX +1 (24)<br>17 Arcane Archer8<br>18 Arcane Archer9 - Toughness<br>19 Arcane Archer10<br>20 Wizard2 - DEX +1 (25)<br>21 Rogue9 - Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow, <br>22 Rogue10 - Improved Evasion<br>23 Rogue11<br>24 Rogue12 - DEX +1 (26) Weapon Prowess, <br>25 Rogue13 - Defensive Roll<br>26 Rogue14<br>27 Rogue15 - Epic Dodge<br>28 Arcane Archer11 - DEX +1 (27)<br>29 Arcane Archer12<br>30 Rogue16 - Improved Sneak Attack I, Improved Sneak Attack II<br>31 Arcane Archer13<br>32 Arcane Archer14 - DEX +1 (28), Great Dexterity I (29)<br>33 Rogue17 - Improved Sneak Attack III<br>34 Arcane Archer15<br>35 Arcane Archer16<br>36 Rogue18 - DEX +1 (30), Improved Sneak Attack IV <br>37 Arcane Archer17<br>38 Arcane Archer18 - Great Dexterity II (31)<br>39 Rogue19 - Improved Sneak Attack V, Improved Sneak Attack VI<br>40 Arcane Archer19 - DEX +1 (32)<br><br>Skills: 327<br>Set Trap: 42 (53)<br>Open Lock: 42 (53)<br>Disable Trap: 42 (45)<br>Hide: 42 (53)<br>Move Silently: 42 (53)<br>Spellcraft: 23 (25)<br>Tumble: 40 (51)<br>UMD: 40 (51)<br>Heal: 14 (13)<br><br>I've got so many skills I don't even know what to place them on, if someone can advice me on a better distribution I will be thankful.<br><br>Saving Throws:<br>Fortitude: 20 (+5 vs. spells)<br>Reflex: 34 (+5 vs. spells)<br>Will: 17 (+5 vs. spells)<br><br>HP: 354<br>AC: 29 (10 base +11 DEX +8 Tumble)<br>BAB: 27<br>AB: +52/+47/+42/+37<br>Damage: 1d8+10 Critical 19-20/X3, sneak attack 16d6(Potential Damage: 26-114)<br><br>His HP is low, and AC isn't that high either (although he's got Uncanny), I suspect this guy works best at a medium magical environment, where he can get items to increase damage but not too high AC items (on my enemies) to mantain his AB high.

None taken, but I disagree.<br><br>You can change the ESFs for Improved Evasion and Defensive Roll and 1 ISA for Epic Dodge; it won't lose the integrity of the build... but I probably won't do it.

Yeah, I'd definitely grab Epic Dodge in this build (I wouldn't go so far as to say a high DEX build without ED is stupid, but I will say a high DEX, high Rogue build with no ED is questionable).<br><br>I'd drop ESF:Hide, ESF:Move, and one of the Imp SA feats, grab Def Roll, Imp Evasion and Epic Dodge.<br><br>Your stelath skills will be very high without the ESF feats (and there are very very few builds that will be able to spot/hear you even without the feats).

I agree with Cin and Fin on this one. No ED in a build with such high DEX (that can obtain it relatively easily), could almost be considered foolish. I also agree with Cin that you should lose the ESF Hide and MS (<i>not</i> Multiple Sclerosis). Using the 2 ESF's in a dex based sneak build, <i>to me</i>, just looks like you're teasing your diabetic opponent with extra sugar on your whipcream covered chocolate mudcake.<br><br>If you don't get my analogy, I really can't blame you (it barely makes sense to me).<br>_________________<br>"You've seen your after life Dilbert. <i>No</i> penalties, <i>no</i> rewards.

I agree with getting Epic Dodge, but since that's already been said I won't comment on it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   The one thing I've noticed is that you took a Wizard level at 20...Is there an actual purpose for that wizard level being right there? If possible, move that wizard level further down (around 37-40ish) and pick up more spellcraft to get saves up a bit more against spells (+3 more from what you had, I believe).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DragonRaider69 on 07/29/06 14:11</span></i></p>

It looks good, a nice sneak attack archer.  You're right, in that it isn't well represented in the guild (though personally I would probably try a rogue/bard/shadowdancer or rogue/cleric/shadowdancer instead).  If I were you I might drop 2 rogue levels for two wizard levels in epic.  You would lose two dice of sneak damage but you would be able to max out your spellcraft and you would pick up ultravision, darkness and invisibility as spells.  Just a thought.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

SD is great for a sneaker archer, but the AB is hardly as good. Actually, losing 2 Rogue levels makes me lose 3d6 sneak attack, because ISA can only be taken as Rogue and every level is taken as Rogue for ISA, the Wizard in epic is still a nice idea for Spellcraft and spells...

Simple, with Bard you get XP penalty, Wizard is the (however was it called, not counting XP penalty) class for Elves. There is little difference in skills anyway since I wouldn't take Bard on epics, you know the song is useless, and Wizard's True Sight can actually get used. AB is exactly the same with Bard and Wizard and the HP is 2 higher per level (4 in total), which is a whortless addition.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 08/02/06 02:07</span></i></p>

GMW might not work on bows but all the other cleric buffs do and a bard can always use curse song before attacking (bard song and war cry will raise that AB by 4 as well).
