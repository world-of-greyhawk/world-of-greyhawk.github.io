A post from the 1.69 beta patch got me really thinking.<br><br>In it there were two changes that would affect a significant number of builds in this forum.<br><br>1) Dragon Shape requires wildshape a 6x per day (from the druid route)<br>2) Epic Dodge requires 30 ranks of tumble<br><br>So as I don't appear fully aggressive I do have one build that would no longer be legit if these changes are in the 1.69.<br><br>I was wondering if there could be a method for retiring (probably not removing) builds that no longer work.  As this topic is extremely controversial I would appreciate any input.

That would seriously fudge up 90% of all Epic Dodge builds, as many people has it before level 27.<br><br>Same thing about Dragonshape I would assume, perhaps to a slightly lesser degree. I don't think they should implement this change. What about the existing builds out there which suddenly becomes illegal.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

ED builds won't really be broken by 1.69, they "just" will have to delay ED till 27th lvl; it's only a matter of build adjustment.<br><br>Now, all club exploit builds and those dragon shape builds with just wildshape 5x will instead be made illegal. Man, a bunch of my favourite builds won't be possible anymore online.<br><br>As far as existing published builds are concerned, let them be. There's not much that can be done, short of going through all of them and posting a warning of illegality with 1.69. If someone wants to do it, let me know. I for one don't have enough time available to do it.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

Well, I for instance would be able to re-post a corrected version of my own builds making them legal, I have a few dragons there grabbing Dragon Shape with 14 Druid levels, which was Wildshape X5 I think, which would be illegal as you say. Thing is there are lots of builds where the original poster isn't here anymore, so that's not really a practical solution at all. I'll wait until 1.69 comes out to test things up, but seriously, you'd need to check every build with Druid, Shadowdancer or Rogue in them to check which are no longer legal, let them be as Kail suggested.<br>_________________<br>Join the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Pre-epic Character Builds</a> Guild for builds capped at level 20 and level 30.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/08/07 18:01</span></i></p>

WHAT!!?  omg, not bioware!<br><br>One question i have is, why on earth would they want to change such things so late into the games history?  If this is such an important or necessary change, why wait for 5 years after release to do it?<br><br>My vote is to not worry about the builds.  It will be an excellent education for new players to figure out why druid 14 dragons dont work anymore!  Its how we all learned, so let us pass on the teaching... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 11/27/07 23:01 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I agree with avado, Storm of Vengeance rocks, it stuns great, it can deal heavy damage over time, and Evasion doesn't work against it, you should try it in your strategy as well, too bad it's conjura</div></blockquote>
