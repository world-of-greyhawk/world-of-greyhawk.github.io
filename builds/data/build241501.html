Hex Blade-the Epic Fighting Bard (Song Version (Single-Player/PvM, but also PvP)<br><br>By Deborah “Tyr”<br><br>At first, they came in peace.<br><br>It did not take long, however, for Caesar to show his Empire’s true intentions; and soon, the entire Celtic village, a simple village by the sea, was under siege. Old men, women, and children alike were being slaughtered; like the tears they cried, the innocent fell, cut down by the invaders, as they wailed beside their fallen loved ones. These cursed invaders had come to the village under false pretences, under false promises of trade and friendship, but this was the way of Caesar. <br><br>Undaunted by the numbers, the villagers, being Celtic warriors, fought on. Each death the invaders caused only served to strengthen the Celts resolve; so long as the heart beat in but a single Celt, the Caesar would be denied. And the Celts fought on, with the courage and the strength of a thousand angry lions, in the name of their mothers, their fathers, and their ancestral line, the little Celtic warrior clan fought on, and eventually, they won. They drove the cursed dogs back, retreating for their very lives, the Celtic clan then swore: not today, not ever. Caesar had been denied today, but it had come at a great price. <br><br>“We chase them to the hills, lads!” demanded a clan member, thirsty for revenge. Women and children and old men lay dead, so many fallen comrades, their deaths would be avenged.<br><br>Among the dead was the Hex Blade’s father; but there was little time for tears. He followed his clansmen into the hills, in hot pursuit of the invaders; in hot pursuit of justice, the death of the villagers would be avenged.<br><br>But on that day, the Hex Blade changed; it was the day his father fell. His father had been a learned bard, with a song so sweet they’d come for miles; and it was his song that earned him a wife.<br><br>The woman of which I speak was none other than the Hex Blade’s mom. A warrior she was, strong and brave, with a heart as strong as a blade; but what was a blade, when the old bard sung, t’was melted in a shake. <br><br>Married him she did, and within a year, she gave birth to their only child. Healthy he was, and battle strong like mom, but with a voice as sweet as dad; because of this, t’was the way of the Celts, he’d grow up to be a bard. <br><br>But the invaders came, and a blade he sought, to avenge his father’s death; and on that day, he made a promise to himself, a warrior strong he’d be. <br><br>He gave up the song, and he learned to fight, the way the warriors fight, and he dreamed of great strength, to have the power of devastating crit; so train he did, he’d toss boulders around, to grow up strong and fit. <br><br>But when it was done, the invaders all gone, many falling to his blade, he dreamed a dream, yet another dream, of a time when he’d be full of song. <br><br>And sad he was ‘cause his father had fell, a fabulous bard he’d been; but was there none to take his place?<br><br>Sword or song, the dilemma went on: what was it that the Hex Blade was to be? Should he strengthen his blade, or tune his song – oh, what was Hex Blade to be? <br><br><br><br>NOTE: this build picks up from the previous version, which poses the following -- when a musician goes to Knight School, it begs the question: which is stronger, the song or the sword? In keeping with the theme, I developed a “SWORD” version (see, Hex Blade, PvP/DevCrit version <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "241384", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>click here</a> ). In this version, the Hex Blade instead focuses on the SONG, and the build has been modified to further optimize his bard abilities (i.e., spell access, among other interesting feats), accordingly. Whereas the SWORD will appeal to those seeking a power build with utility, having great strength and the Devastating Critical feat, this SONG version will appeal to players interested in single-player/PvM, and/or role-playability. That having been said (and in keeping with the musical scale), Every Good Bard Deserves Fun, and are welcome in PvP settings.<br><br><i>You can check the other variants of the build <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "241104", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>here</a> and <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "241177", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>here</a></i>.<br><br>HEX BLADE<br><br>Overview<br><br>Fighter: 18 <br>Ba: 15<br>Weapon Master: 7<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Neutral Good Preferred (Any Non-Lawful) <br><br>Starting Stats<br>STR: 14 <br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 9<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 13<br><br>Final Stats<br>STR: 26<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 9<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 16<br><br>BAB: 29<br>AB: 29, +42 (naked), +2 singing/+2 war cry<br><br><br>Saving Throws:<br>Fort: 26 (+2, song buffed)<br>Will: 22 (+2, song buffed)<br>Reflex: 24 (+2, song buffed)<br><br>Equipment:<br>Plate Armor, Great Axe<br><br>AC: 32 (+4, song buffed)<br>HP: 420 (+16, song buffed)<br><br>Spell Casting: Bard Level 5<br>SR (Bard Level 15): 15, +1d20<br><br><br>Final Skills: <br>Concentration 41(43)<br>Discipline 41(49)<br>Perform 25(28)<br>Taunt 35(38)<br>Tumble 40(42)<br>UMD 31(34)<br><br>Secondary Skills: <br>Intimidate 4(7)<br>Listen 15(14)<br>Spot 15(14)<br><br><br><br>What follows is the epic career path of the Hex Blade, the fighting bard, having chosen the Song over the Sword: <br><br>01: Bard(1): Lingering Song, Curse Song<br>02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Greataxe<br>03: Fighter(2): Power Attack, Dodge<br>04: Fighter(3): STR+1, (STR=15)<br>05: Fighter(4): Cleave<br>06: Bard(2): Mobility<br>07: Fighter(5)<br>08: Fighter(6): STR+1, Knockdown, (STR=16)<br>09: Bard(3): Spring Attack<br>10: Fighter(7)<br>11: Fighter(8): Weapon Specialization: Greataxe<br>12: Bard(4): STR+1, Expertise, (STR=17)<br>13: Fighter(9)<br>14: Fighter(10): Whirlwind Attack<br>15: Weapon Master(1): Improved Critical: Greataxe, Weapon of Choice: Greataxe<br>16: Weapon Master(2): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>17: Weapon Master(3)<br>18: Weapon Master(4): Still Spell<br>19: Weapon Master(5)<br>20: Weapon Master(6): STR+1, (STR=19)<br>21: Weapon Master(7): Great Strength I, (STR=20)<br>22: Bard(5)<br>23: Fighter(11)<br>24: Fighter(12): STR+1, Epic Fortitude, Epic Weapon Focus: Greataxe, (STR=21)<br>25: Fighter(13)<br>26: Fighter(14): Epic Weapon Specialization: Greataxe<br>27: Bard(6): Great Strength II, (STR=22)<br>28: Bard(7): STR+1, (STR=23)<br>29: Bard(8)<br>30: Fighter(15): Epic Will<br>31: Fighter(16): Epic Prowess<br>32: Bard(9): CHA+1, (CHA=14)<br>33: Fighter(17): Great Strength III, (STR=24)<br>34: Bard(10)<br>35: Bard(11)<br>36: Fighter(18): CHA+1, Great Strength IV, Armor Skin, (STR=25), (CHA=15)<br>37: Bard(12)<br>38: Bard(13)<br>39: Bard(14): Great Charisma I, (CHA=16)<br>40: Bard(15): STR+1, (STR=26)<br><br><br>Skills Progression by Level<br><br>01: Concentration(4), Discipline(4), Intimidate(2), Tumble(2), Save(14), <br>02: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(16), <br>03: Perform(6), Tumble(1), Save(19), <br>04: Discipline(2), Intimidate(1), Save(20), <br>05: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Save(21), <br>06: Perform(3), Taunt(1), Tumble(2), Save(22), <br>07: Concentration(2), Discipline(2), Save(23), <br>08: Concentration(3), Discipline(1), Save(24), <br>09: Perform(3), Taunt(3), Save(25), <br>10: Discipline(2), Save(28), <br>11: Discipline(1), Save(32), <br>12: Perform(3), Taunt(3), UMD(5), Save(28), <br>13: Discipline(2), Save(31), <br>14: Discipline(1), Save(35), <br>15: Discipline(1), Listen(5), Spot(5), Save(29), <br>16: Discipline(1), Listen(5), Spot(5), Taunt(1), Save(21), <br>17: Discipline(1), Listen(5), Spot(5), Save(15), <br>18: Discipline(1), Save(19), <br>19: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(21), <br>20: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(23), <br>21: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(25), <br>22: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Tumble(12), UMD(18), <br>23: Discipline(1), Save(4), <br>24: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Save(7), <br>25: Concentration(2), Discipline(1), Save(9), <br>26: Discipline(1), Save(13), <br>27: Discipline(1), Save(19), <br>28: Taunt(3), Tumble(6), Save(17), <br>29: Taunt(6), Save(18), <br>30: Concentration(2), Save(21), <br>31: Discipline(4), Save(22), <br>32: Concentration(3), Discipline(1), Taunt(14), Tumble(8), UMD(3), <br>33: Concentration(5), <br>34: Concentration(3), Discipline(1), Perform(2), UMD(1), <br>35: Concentration(2), Discipline(1), Perform(2), UMD(1), Save(1), <br>36: Concentration(5), Discipline(1), <br>37: Discipline(1), Perform(2), Tumble(4), <br>38: Concentration(3), Perform(2), Tumble(2), <br>39: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Perform(2), Tumble(3), <br>40: Concentration(3), Discipline(1), UMD(3),<br><br><br>Special thanks and acknowledgments to everyone here, for helping me to better this build (both versions): thanks!<br><br><br><i>Added links, edited title to add new account name -

IMPORTANT: Please note that this PvM/Song version is, barring any further great comments, the *final* version (as of May 23, 2006, at: 1:00 A.M. (est). This replaces the earlier version entitled, "bardic/RP abilities, no devcrit),plus PvP version," which contained a typo/cut-and-paste error. <br><br>Once again, I'd like to thank the great team here, whose observations and comments about this character are  appreciated. As the builder of the Hex Blade, which I not only created but also had (and continue to have) wonderful fun playing, it's not always easy to step-aside of one's creation. I have done my best, in bringing this character out for the community's enjoyment, to remove myself of all bias and "feel" I may otherwise have had for this character; howerver, having had such fun with this character, there is always a possibility, however remote, that some bias may creep in. As such, the members of the guild have provided me with fresh eyes, and a completely unbiased opinion. For PvP/DevCrit players, there is another version of the Hex Blade available, having in its subject title: the "PvP/DevCrit" version. That guild members have taken such an interest in both version of the Hex Blade, working with me and providing the polish to fine-tune and tweak this character, has been wonderful, indeed. Their efforts are appreciated. <br><br><br>I truly hope that everyone in the community enjoys the Hex Blade, whichever version may be preferable to you; take him on marvelous adventures so that he'll sing and he'll slash for a long time to come. ~ Deborah Tyr.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Robert Tyr on 05/23/06 06:15</span></i></p>
