AA's usually have pants HP and in a PvM or even PvP environment you dont last long if you're not a Run and Gun (Monk/AA). Additionally, many people who come from a melee heavy experience can't really play AA's well. He's an attempt to rectify this:<br><br>An AA Tank?!<br><br>Meet Thunderstorm:<br><br>---<br><br>Race: Elf<br>Stats:<br>STR: 12 [22]<br>DEX: 16 [24]<br>CON: 14 [24]<br>WIS: 8  [8]<br>INT: 12 [14]<br>CHA: 12 [14]<br><br>Breakdown:<br>--<br>LvL 1-5: Bard (5 Bard)<br>Feats: Point Blank Shot, Weapon Focus Longbow<br>Skill: Lore 8 @ lvl 5<br>Spells: Amplify, Iron Horn, Cats (rest are up to you)<br>Atts: Con +1 [15]<br>--<br>LvL 6-10: RDD (5 RDD)<br>Feats: Dodge, Mobility<br>Atts: Con +1 [16]<br>--<br>LvL 11-20: AA (10 AA)<br>Feats: Imp Critical Longbow, Toughness, Called Shot<br>Atts: Con +3 [19]<br>--<br>LvL 21: Bard (6 Bard)<br>Feats: Epic Weapon Focus Longbow<br>Skills: Soak Disc, Listen<br>--<br>LvL 22-33: AA (22 AA)<br>Feats: Great Dex 4, Epic Prowess, ESF: Disc, ESF: Listen<br>Atts: Con +3 [22]<br>--<br>LvL 34-38: RDD (10 RDD)<br>Feats: Great Dex 5<br>Atts: Dex +1 [22]<br>--<br>LvL 39-40: Bard (8 Bard)<br>Feats: Great Dex 6<br>Atts: Dex +1 [24]<br>Skills: Soak @ 40 Disc, Listen, Tumble, Spellcraft and UMD<br>Spells: Claryonance, Displacement<br><br>---<br><br>Final NAKED Stats armed with a BASIC Longbow:<br><br>BAB: 26<br>AB's first attack: +47<br>Fort: 37<br>Reflex: 37<br>Will: 28<br>HP: 628<br>AC: 29<br><br>---<br><br>PROS: Very Good AB (items/Dex bonus you can hit +60 or more very easily), Great HP (again easily boostable), Solid Fort, RDD Bonuses (Immune to Fire, Stun, Paraylisis), Decent Damage for an AA (1-8 +18 pre buff), Sneaker Killer with 82 Listen Check Without any listen gear (using Amplify and Clarvoyance), Maxed Disc and ESF and Strength makes you VERY Hard to KD/IKD.<br><br>CONS: AC will never be great. But it can be good. With gear not better than +5/+6 you can push it to 60s. To counter this spam Called Shot: Arm. Lowish Will Saves.<br><br>--<br><br>NOTES:<br><br>Many things can be shifted/changed about this build. For instance in a PvP server I would lose Epic Prowess for Blind Fight, OR possibly two Great Dex for Blind Fight and Armor Skin. Also if you wanted to Ghetto HiPs (max hide and ms) then Drop the 12 Strength in the start and go for 14 Int to being with).<br><br>The HP and AB are key here. With that much HP (which without God-Gear you can push to 750+) this AA can tank. You can spam Called Shot: Arm/Leg with your AB and drop enemies/monsters/pcs threat to nil.<br><br>Spell wise you're scant and they wont last long but when PvPing against a sneak Listen is Way better than Spot and that naked 83 check before dice are rolled is very dangerous. Add a +10 or +12 or +20 item and you'll smoke all of them with Called Shot: Leg.<br><br>Comments?

Nice HP for an AA, I think it's really fun to make an AA with RDD.... an AB of +60 would be actually low (for an AA, it is great for any other class), AA builds easily get over +70 with good equipment.<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong, but when I made an AA, I tested that the character sheet didn't improved my AB with Epic Prowess, that character sheet has decieved me before..... but for what I know, Epic Prowess doesn't work with ranged items.<br><br>Your STR is too high, capped +12 with items you will get +12 modifier and go off the mighty range of most composed longbows, you would need a really high one, but if you can get it, go on.<br><br>Call shot leg is really fun if the enemy is not inmune to slow, but you could get surprised. I think it's a very good build.

Epic Prowess, Like Called Shot Arm doesn't show up on the Character Sheet...<br><br>but the log tells a different story.<br><br>They both work fine with ranged (but ranged is funny that way where some stats dont show up on the sheet.)<br><br>As for the Strength, On most PW servers (all the good ones) and things like the OC you can't max more than two Attributes. So the point is to make Strength cap off at 22 and then all you pump att wise is Dex and Con, trying to squeeze in as much AC where you can.<br><br>This build, if you maxed Dex and use, say a +7 longbow (which is far more uber on many PW servers) your AB is +60. Other servers (PvP, god-like PW servers) you can punch in over +70 no sweat.<br><br>But the AB (while not great for an AA) is sacrificed for HP, which as any player with a brain knows is the most critical stat you have.<br><br>When you have HP that you can easily pump with minimal gear boost to over 750 or so then you have more HP than most melee builds and your AB tops them.<br><br>one more CON though:<br><br>AOO's suck. And this build gets tons of em. WHY Bioware didn't add a feat that loses AOO's for AA's (like a tenth lvl feat or an epic feat) boggles my mind.
