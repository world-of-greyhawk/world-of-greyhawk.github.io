With your spells you can make the charisma reach 32-35 with a 11-12 bonus to the divine feats. With items you can reach cha 38 with a 14 bonus. It becomes very tempting to try and squeeze in Divine Might here. <br>And if you are going to use both DM and DS extensively, extra turning becomes a feat to consider even with the added number of attempts from the high cha.<br>I would think of extend spell and IKD as feats that could possibly be dropped.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

Interesting observation, Mick.  Frankly, I'm surprised that Divine Might isn't listed in the build.  I would drop IKD, grab D.M.,knock Int down to 12 and raise Charisma to 15, and then use your extra Epic Feat to grab Epic Prowess.  <br><br>Pro's: Divine Might with high Charisma and +1AB<br><br>Con: loss of IKD and some skill points.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Like it, one drake to another <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      <br><br>That pally's are kinda feat starved is unfortunate, but that's the nature of the beast. For a smiter, your AB is good, def. good use of the RDD, with good damage, too. Also, at high level pally, you've divfav, bless, prayer, aura of glory, etc. to help your AB &amp; damage out. Pally buffs aren't of a very long duration, but they're pretty good; with your levels, they'll go a few rounds such that it is playable. Nice thing too is that pally buffs aren't subject to armor failure; it's too bad you couldn't fit in the divine and epic prowess, but not a real problem: so buff if you need to, land your IKD, and smite the evil boss character and/or fight away - well done (and yeah, IKD is def. handy, esp. for a drake that has a breath weapon, too).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/13/06 07:00</span></i></p>

On the other hand, you may really want to listen to what Grizz and Mick have to say; with your high pally level and cha-bonus, divine might would allow you to dish out damage, too. Also, in some situations, KD can be as good as IKD, thus enabling you to take epic prowess, for a permanent AB boost <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   Your drake is a neat concept, I reiterate; but would be a shame not to take advantage of all those pally levels and cha-bonus, which cha can then be raised, too (it's worth considering <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/13/06 07:32</span></i></p>

actually, i am convinced. the tipping point for me was true strike - i can land a knockdown if i need one so IKD is . . . well not superfluous but not as valuable as divine might and epic prowess together, which is basically what it cost.<br><br>so, score a victory to the grizzled short one.  <br><br>i think my record against the unshaven dwarf is fairly dismal but i keep trying. 0.o<br><br>cheers

If you drop con to 10 and raise cha to 16 you dont need 2 gr cha feats - divine power and epic prowress and you keep imp kd.
