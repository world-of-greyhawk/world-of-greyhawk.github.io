For Basic Classes this should be no problem, but how do you define Pure for Prestige Classes, when you can only take a max of 30? and only 5 for Harper Scout?<br><br>Any parameters for this?<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Apart the fact that  some PrCs have little purpouse taken all the way to lvl 30, there's anyhow more than 1 way to fill the remaining 10 lvls with 1-2 other classes (among which there could be another prestige class, f.e. FTR 6/CoT 4/WM 30). <br><br>Even if by pure PrCs builds we mean builds where you take all the 30 allowed lvls of that PrC, the spectrum of possible builds widens with respect to basic classes. Especially HS "pure" builds.

Well, since the theme is "pure" anyway, we could say that a "pure" PrC build must have 10 levels of a single base class, and 30 levels of the prestige class. That will cut down the number of possible combinations a bit. SO, Fighter 10/WM 30, Fighter 10/DwD 30, Bard 10/RDD 30, Rogue 10/SD 30, etc.<br><br>TM

There are too many advantages to multiclassing. This isn't to make the "best" builds, but to see what can be done with no multiclassing for base classes and minimal multiclassing for PrC classes. It's just for fun, not to claim that such builds are the best. Even the base classes benefit so much from a few levels of something else that they are rarely done pure. <br><br>It's also to do something different - yes, the "Max CoT" build would be better with 4 fighter levels, but how many builds are already out there with 4 fighter levels followed by a bunch of CoT? A ton. For good reason, you get a lot of benefit from those 4 levels. But the idea here is to see how much you can get from each class while using the fewest classes possible. That's pure for base classes, 10/30 for PrC's. Nobody is claiming that they are the best builds, just the best with that criteria.<br><br>TM

Here's something I was considering reading this: looking at the requisite feats for some classes, I wonder if its as easy as 10/30 for prcs.  What about weapon master?   I know its done as a strength based, but the feats you MUST take suggest something else.. a dexer!   Then its not so simple as 10/30 cuz a dexer fighter, could be better suggested by a rogue, which needs 12 lvls human or 15 lvls non-human to get to whirlwind to qualify for wm!  Then the lvl split is 15/25!  (id suggest non-human so you can qual for epic dodge too!  LOL).  So who's to say that a non-human wm must have 10/30 when it can realistically be looked at from this perspective. <br><br>Oh, and someone mentioned Harper scout.  THere's a class!  TO be considered "pure" wouldnt you take 35/5?  I suggest this because from my limited understanding of harper scouts, arent they sorta like a High counsil" type, then that would suggest, for example a lv35 paladin taking the last 5 lvls as harper as a priviledge or somethin like that.   <br><br>I make these 2 suggestions because I feel we are all so focused on 10/30 for prcs that we sometimes miss out on other valid interpretations.  And to limit our idea of ftr/wm as the ONLY interpretation is sad, when wm offers so much more to classes other than fighter.<br><br>just my 2 cents.<br><br>Peace

Then the split would be 17wiz/23SD giving me level 9 spells.
