I picked Zen archery for him to make him more of a support/caster type, and with a wis of 32 thats a nice AB bonus.<br><br>He does have a slighly lower than might be needed SR, but he has a few spells that can get around SR and as I said, he is a cleric, so he can always go in and melee. A dragon whose attacks deal an additional +7 magical damage and has flurry of blows and all those nice cleric buffs to raise his AB is not someone that you really want to go up against.<br><br>That said, his buffs can be dispelled, but he is no mage so in a pure one on one fight with a high lvl mage he will loose. However, in a nice party, he can buff his party up the wazzu! and keep on casting mass heals or summoning creatures and casting creeping dooms up until the other side either runs out of spells, or dies.<br><br>Now as I said, there are a few changes you can do to him.<br>One of the things that this build could use is either HellBall and/or Martial wepaon (for the bows)<br><br>One of the changes is making him a  cleric 22/druid 17/monk 1. This gives you all of the druid lvl 9 spells (if you need them). This also gives him a feat at the expnse of lowering the wisdom by 2 points.<br><br>Alternatively, you could still lower his wisdom to 30 and take Martial and Hellball if you wish. A bow is the most powerful ranged weapon that there is and this will give him a very nice boost in regular combat output.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 06/23/05 23:11</span></i></p>

This is really a great build. I love the implosion and the versitility. You get a powerful caster that can be a skilled archer and turn into a dragon! It's brilliant. IMO I would go for the martial feat.

yes, he can get hit, and I do wish I could have had the feats to include Imp. Expertise on him.<br>I guess thats another possible thing to do and bring down the wisdom to 30 but gain an AC of +9 (you loose one from getting wis 30 instead of 32)
