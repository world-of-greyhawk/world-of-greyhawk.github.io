Should be pretty easy to make, I'm just not a good build maker. Alot of levels of AA and Ranger, hopefully enough Wizard to have somewhat decent buffs. Thanks in advance.

Off the top of my head, I'd say try Ranger 21/Wizard 10/AA 9.  This will allow you to get Bane of Enemies as well as Enchant Arrows +5 and 5th lvl Arcane spells.  You'll get a couple bonus feats from Wizard, which should help although of course you won't be a very powerful caster.  <br><br>For the best BAB, take all Ranger levels pre-epic.  Then, start taking levels of Wizard and AA.  Take your last level of Ranger at level 39 and pick up Bane of Enemies.  Make sure to save skill credits to max Discipline and any other Ranger skills at lvl 39.  <br><br>Also, you'll probably want the Extend Spell feat for your Wizard buffs, and definitely pick up Called Shot, as it's quite useful for slowing down your opponents.
