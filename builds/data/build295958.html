It will make pre-epic a bit more pain though. So it would be really swell if immune to KD items exist where one wants to play this. Being able to cast in melee range is completely necessary so you "need" both. The AC combined with 632 hitpoints along with 21/- DR and ImpInvis should make you last a while. It will be a hard-to-kill build with decent spellpower, and even slightly buffed it can handle mobs and weaker enemies in melee quite decent. Or just put up a Blade barrier.<br><br>You can defend switching 4 DwDs for 4 Cleric, making you close to undispellable and raising your penetration to a needed level. You'll 'only' loose 3/- DR and 16 hitpoints in the process. Maximise and Empower can maybe be switched pre-epic for Greater penetration also, giving you a penetration of 28, which is mostly sufficient.<br><br>This build got decent saves too. I forgot, Defensive stance adds +2 to STR and +4 to CON and 4 diodge AC. You won't be using it much though, because you can't cast in stance.<br><br>There's many Cleric Defenders out there, but none are caster based.

True, we usually take Cleric and Dwarven Defender for melee presence, not as a caster. Personally, I prefer Druid for offensive divine casting, I guess I'll make one inspired on your idea.<br><br>As for the build, I like it, good melee presence for a caster <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  those Clerics buffs are so good. Spell DC is fine.<br><br>Even if you're caster, I'd try to squeeze Blind-Fight, I recall it makes invisible creatures get no bonus against you in melee, and sneakers are one of the few things that can kill tankers.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
