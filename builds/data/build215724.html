The alignment problems with this build aren't the worst. You have to get from Lawful to Neutral from lvl 20 to 21. Just do some break-ins or some stealing. Very possible on most modules and servers. Then you have to get from Good to Neutral from you hit 20 and before you hit 23. Just waste a few kids or something. That's it. Not the worst alignment change.<br>This will be a tough nut to crack, very capable of holding his own. His saves are bad though. They will be improved if you can get hold of some CHA boosting items, or start with more CHA.

hey , well thats the build im using actually <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>but i took different feats and started with different abilites...<br><br>first i took str only 14 i think but also cha 14 , instead of skill focus disc and imp kd i took power attack and divine might and shield .<br><br>epic i took epic skill focus taunt instead of discipline and instead of gr str 1&amp;2 i took 2 epic enrgey resistances more (fire vs falmeweapon , darkfire, and flamearrow, and acid if i want to hit a mage ) <br><br>i end up with a lower ab than you do but due to taunt what is 55 (61 with maxed charisma) i can drop my opponents ac and give them a nice spellfailure<br><br>also with divine might i deal 9 extra divine dmg(if i can get my charisma maxed ),andno spell or warden can protect you from that ;P <br><br>my charisma makes it possible for me to use bard spells, blagaorns ironhorn and darkness can be cast without still spell feat while wearing plate, tough if you want to make darkness of use you need a wizzie /sorc to buff you or u need tobbe able to prepare before you enter the battle and cast ulta byyourself...(darkness is devastating to ur opponent , you will dispell his ultra/trueseeing and then hes kina done) <br><br>also as weapon i use waraxe...like the crits ;9 <br><br><br>on a lower magic world i would even go with only 16 pally but 8 bard...keen edge is a nice spell and displacement can be cast while wearing plate  m, you loose 1 point base ab but song gives you +2 so shorterm you end up with the same ab <br><br>with a full plate and a towershield i ended up with 69 ac buffed...hasted and with +4 to dex your ac is 75 . if a leric buffs your shield with magic vestment you will have 80 .

The only problem I see with this build, as I've seen with quite a few builds as of late, that they are made specifically for one particular Persistant World.<br><br>An environment where there are no alignment restrictions, and one can get +12 to all stats is, frankly, a bit preposterous.<br><br>The overarching premise of the Epic Builders Guild is a place to trade builds that are playable by all, and playable in a variety of environments.  And while I do not frown on alignment changes now and then, I do frown on builds that are tailored specifically for one Persistant World.  At which point, why not just post it there?<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

well on most worls you can max out one of your abilites ...the primary abilits for my build version are str and charisma ...<br><br>you get bullstr spell , aura of glory (+4 char) and eagles splendor , and i think in most worls its possible to get at least +4 to another stat .<br><br>also i can tell you this build does very well (the class combos , you always should adjust feats to your pw) ...<br><br>most of the ac comes from natural feats  , epic mage armor , divine shield ,even without any char bonus from items you can get 5to6  extra ac and dmg from your divine feats <br><br>alignemnt change for this build? should be possible on many pws... it is the typical fallen paladine tough you will have to rp why you turn evil and chaotic/neutral , but this can be most interesting ... you never have to switch your aligment back to good once you took bard / pm lvls  unlike in many other builds that require alignment changes

Point is: Make builds for all. do not post for specific servers. It's still viable to say: if no dev-crit is allowed, go this and that. Or something like: if you have access to CHA boosting items, do like this and that.<br>Capisze?

Hey, it's not for ONE particular PW and you can choose any class rather than pally... And it isn't based around +12 to all stats. I posted naked stats and the stats if it WAS all maxed. On DeX only str, con and cha ends up getting maxed. I use a cat's grace pot to get over 12 dex for the +1 ac bonus. A lil extra cha helps with the saves. So it isn't just for one PW. Also what isn't to say this dwarf is a paladin for most of his life when he finally becomes sick of it and decides to explore the darker arts maybe a) to further his skills to protect<br>                  b) he had a breakdown and fell<br><br>Your char you make the choices.

As a point of interest, I too have played a similar build on my PM.  I don't think this build is terribly world-specific, save for the few comments about asir subraces and the way he calculated his AC.  I think slight variations of this build are pretty solid on any mid magic PW that lets you change alignment.  I personally would abandon the epic skill focus feats and try to squeeze in devine shield to maximize AC (that is the point, isnt it), but these are minor changes for the most part.

You are absolutely correct about divine shield. If you can max your charisma you can get a +5 bonus to your ac. IF you can max it. Not possible everywhere so I put in the sfs. Just sub sf disc for power attack and esf disc for divine shield or however you like.

So a fallen paladin still retains the spellcasting? It is only the ability to level as a paladin that is lost?
