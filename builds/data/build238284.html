Well me and a bunch of rl friends decided to start new characters and level them up as a party on the PW we play on, as I didn’t feel like restarting my bard I had to come up with a new character idea. Always liked paladins – but the goody two shoes approach people perceive for them annoys me sometimes, and theres loads of chests and traps on the server we play on, so I decided Paladin/Rogue. This was looking rather feat starved and by level 16 the paladin gets level 4 spells anyway and theres isn’t a great reason to take him further, sure lay on hands etc. gets a bit better per level but enough to take another x levels of paladin. The same with rogue, not doing a dex build I didn’t feel the need to take more rogue levels passed 16 for bonus rogue feats. <br><br>Fighter would have been nice for extra feats but would have led to xp penalties, so I decided on the good old CoT – extra feats, divine wrath and a bit of a boost to saves. I took rogue to 16 mainly because I wanted crippling strike, slippery mind and improved evasion. Rerolling will and reflex saves when they are boosted by CoT and paladin comes in quite handy..<br><br>As for the race – I’m in a Halfling frame of mind at the moment, granted Human would probably be the better choice, an extra feat, extra skill points, no loss of strength and as im not using the Halfling dex bonus I wouldn’t miss it. Added to that the Halfling bonus to fear saves is never used due to paladins being immune and all I really get out of the Halfling is a bonus to ac for small stature and an inability to use tower shields and large weapons. However – as I say – Im having fun making Halfling builds at the moment so the Halfling won. I went for longsword over say rapier or scimitar because there are some very good holy avenger longswords on the PW we are playing on.<br><br>Anyway heres the build for critique and character assassination <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Race – Halfling (Human is probably better for feats and skills)<br>Alignment – Lawful Good<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 	13<br>Dex 	10<br>Con 	14<br>Wis 	14<br>Int 	12<br>Cha 	14<br><br><br>Leveling<br><br>1 	Rogue 1 – Power Attack<br>2	Rogue 2 <br>3 	Paladin 1 - Cleave<br>4	Paladin 2 - +1 Str<br>5 	Paladin 3<br>6 	Paladin 4 – Divine Might<br>7 	Paladin 5 <br>8 	Paladin 6 - +1 Cha<br>9 	Paladin 7 – Divine Shield<br>10	Paladin 8 <br>11 	Paladin 9<br>12 	Rogue 3 – Weapon focus: Longsword, +1 Cha<br>13 	Paladin 10 <br>14 	Paladin 11<br>15 	Paladin 12 – Extra Turning<br>16 	Paladin 13 - +1 Str<br>17 	Paladin 14<br>18 	Paladin 15 – Improved critical: Longsword<br>19	Paladin 16<br>20	Rogue 4 - +1 Str<br>21	CoT 1 – Great Charisma I<br>22	CoT 2 – Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword<br>23 	Rogue 5<br>24 	Rogue 6 – Great Charisma II, +1 Str<br>25 	Rogue 7<br>26 	Rogue 8<br>27 	Rogue 9 – Great Charisma III<br>28 	Rogue 10 – Crippling strike, +1 Str<br>29 	CoT 3<br>30 	CoT 4 – Epic Prowess, Great Charisma IV<br>31	Rogue 11<br>32 	Rogue 12 - +1 Str<br>33 	Rogue 13 – Great Strength I, Slippery Mind<br>34 	CoT 5<br>35	Rogue 14<br>36 	Rogue 15 – Great Charisma V, +1 Str<br>37 	CoT 6 – Armour skin<br>38 	CoT 7<br>39 	CoT 8 – Great Charisma VI, Blind Fight<br>40	Rogue 16 – Improved Evasion, +1 Str<br><br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 	22<br>Dex 	10<br>Con 	14<br>Wis 	14<br>Int 	12<br>Cha 	22<br><br><br>Skills<br><br>1 	Disable Trap 4, Open Lock 4, Search 4, Set Trap 4, Tumble 4, UMD 4.<br>2	Disable Trap 1, Open Lock 1, Search 1, Set Trap 1, Tumble 1, UMD 1.<br>3 	Discipline 6.<br>4 	Discipline 1.<br>5 	Discipline 1.<br>6 	Discipline 1.<br>7 	Discipline 1.<br>8 	Discipline 1.<br>9 	Discipline 1.<br>10	Discipline 1.<br>11 	Discipline 1.<br>12 	Disable Trap 5, Open Lock 5, Search 5, Set Trap 5, Tumble 10, UMD 5.<br>13 	Discipline 2.<br>14 	Discipline 1.<br>15 	Discipline 1.<br>16 	Discipline 1.<br>17 	Discipline 1.<br>18 	Discipline 1.<br>19	Discipline 1.<br>20	Disable Trap 4, Open Lock 4, Search 4, Set Trap 4, Tumble 5, UMD 3.<br>21	Discipline 2.<br>22	Discipline 1.<br>23 	Disable Trap 1, Open Lock 1, Search 1, Set Trap 1, Tumble 5, UMD 2.<br>24  	Disable Trap 2, Open Lock 2, Search 2, Set Trap 2.<br>25 	Disable Trap 2, Open Lock 2, Search 2, Set Trap 2.<br>26 	Disable Trap 2, Open Lock 2, Search 2, Set Trap 2.<br>27 	Disable Trap 1, Open Lock 1, Search 1, Set Trap 1, Tumble 5, UMD 4.<br>28 	Disable Trap 1, Open Lock 1, Search 1, Set Trap 1.<br>29 	Discipline 7.<br>30 	Discipline 1.<br>31	Disable Trap 2, Open Lock 2, Search 2, Set Trap 2.<br>32 	Disable Trap 1, Open Lock 1, Search 1, Set Trap 1, Tumble 5.<br>33 	Disable Trap 2, Open Lock 2, Search 2, Set Trap 2, UMD 1.<br>34 	Discipline 4.<br>35	Disable Trap 1, Open Lock 1, Search 1, Set Trap 1.<br>36 	Disable Trap 1, Open Lock 1, Search 1, Set Trap 1, UMD 5.<br>37 	Discipline 2.<br>38 	save<br>39 	save<br>40	Disable Trap 5, Open Lock 5, Search 4, Set Trap 5, Tumble 5.<br><br><br><br>HP - 329<br><br><br>AC – 20 naked, 28 basic full plate	<br><br><br>AB – unarmed 36/31/26/21, Basic Longsword	39/34/29/24<br><br><br>Saves ..start/end<br><br>Fort	34<br>Reflex	30<br>Will	29<br><br>I chose the first two levels as rogue to get a boost to the skill points and an early start on disarm traps, open locks and tumble. I went all paladin pre epic to get the divine might, shield, extra turning and full paladin spells along with a good AB, the other 2 pre epic rogue levels were taken as skill dumps. <br><br>I tried to get a balance between a Cha based character and Str based, as such he doesn’t excel at any one, however with extra turning, divine shield and divine might with some items to boost charisma he makes up for the lack of strength.<br><br>I didn’t take hide or move silently because this guys a paladin – that means full palte and none of this sneaking about!<br><br>UMD is capped on the server I play on – as I discovered the other day with my bard, much to my shock – it cant be raised higher than 10 + rogue/bard level. So with 16 levels of rogue the most I could take it to would be 26.<br><br>Anyway that’s the build – any ideas for improvement? Apart from using human – even though I know it would make the build far better and easier to use probably….

A couple of suggestions:<br><br>Drop Rogue to 13 (sacrificing Slippery Mind) and either Paladin to 19 (more spells) or Paladin to 17 and CoT to 10 (more spells, another feat, improved saves and better Divine Wrath)<br><br>Drop Cleave and replace with any of Toughness, Extend Spell,  KD, Blind Fight.

You really do not benefit from the Strength being taken that high - overall the build is weaker due to trying to do too much. Take STR to 18 by all means, but I would seriously consider leaving it there. After all with your buffs and Strength boosting equipment, which is usually quite common, this can be improved readily.<br><br>I would be tempted to leave your rogue levels until 21st and beyond, purely to allow your 4th level spells becoming available sooner and preserving your AB and better HP. Taking some CoT pre-epic would be sensible as well - for instance Blind Fight is currently taken near the end of the builds life.<br><br>Anyway, a few tweaks give this below:<br><br>STR: 13 (20)<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 12<br>CHA: 14 (22)<br><br>01: Paladin(1): Weapon Focus: Longsword<br>02: Paladin(2): {Smite Evil}<br>03: Paladin(3): Extra Turning<br>04: Paladin(4): STR+1, (STR=14)<br>05: Paladin(5)<br>06: Paladin(6): Power Attack<br>07: Paladin(7)<br>08: Paladin(8): STR+1, (STR=15)<br>09: Paladin(9): Divine Might<br>10: Paladin(10)<br>11: Paladin(11)<br>12: Paladin(12): CHA+1, Divine Shield, (CHA=15)<br>13: Paladin(13)<br>14: Paladin(14)<br>15: Paladin(15): Extend Spell<br>16: Paladin(16): CHA+1, (CHA=16)<br>17: Champion of Torm(1)<br>18: Champion of Torm(2): Toughness, Blind Fight<br>19: Champion of Torm(3)<br>20: Champion of Torm(4): CHA+1, Knockdown, (CHA=17)<br>21: Champion of Torm(5): Great Charisma I, (CHA=18)<br>22: Rogue(1)<br>23: Champion of Torm(6): Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword<br>24: Champion of Torm(7): CHA+1, Great Charisma II, (CHA=20)<br>25: Champion of Torm(8): Epic Prowess<br>26: Rogue(2): {Evasion}<br>27: Rogue(3): Great Charisma III, {Uncanny Dodge I}, (CHA=21)<br>28: Rogue(4): STR+1, (STR=16)<br>29: Rogue(5)<br>30: Rogue(6): Great Strength I, (STR=17)<br>31: Rogue(7)<br>32: Rogue(8): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>33: Rogue(9): Great Strength II, (STR=19)<br>34: Rogue(10): Crippling Strike<br>35: Rogue(11)<br>36: Rogue(12): STR+1, Epic Will, (STR=20)<br>37: Paladin(17)<br>38: Paladin(18)<br>39: Paladin(19): Armor Skin<br>40: Rogue(13): CHA+1, Improved Evasion, (CHA=22)<br><br>Hitpoints: 468<br>Skillpoints: 207<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 37/33/30<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Traps: +2, Fear: +2<br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 33 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 21/31<br>Spell Casting: Paladin(4)<br><br>Overall you gain in AB, CHA, Fort Save +3, Will Save +4 and hitpoints. <br><br>You maintain your sneak attack at 7d6, rather than 8d6, which is not a great deal to be honest.
