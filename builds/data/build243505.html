Aye, Scimitar would increase his playablity too, since you get a shield. About time this was done, since the original Damage Adept wasn't really playable at all. Actually, it was just as much a gimmick-build as my halfling max-AB'er. <br><br>Nice job. Although it's still highly feat-stacrved.

Lowish AB unbuffed, but the smite damage is awesome enough that it's not an issue.<br><br>Scimitar would be better, yeah ... given that you would have a much higher chance of landing 3 critical smites in a row. Plus you would have a shield and knockdown.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

Nice adaptation... I second the scimmy/shield proposition, especially once you get into magic equipment a shield is worth a lot of AC.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Thanks guys! Scythe was left in the build more for theme reasons or better say because of the origin of the build and to have a more direct comparison with the damage adept. <br><br>I'd definitely go with scimmy and board and my tests have confirmed it's the best solution. KD comes in handy, although I could definitely do with a couple more feats (IKd, blind fight, toughness).<br><br>AB is lowish, but normal for a Great Smiter build. I'm satisfied with the results; the build, especially the scimitar wielding version, is playable and I can't get rid of that big smile on my face when I land a critical smite <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?

This is a nice modification to the damage adept build,it does increase playability but I think the Paladin 26/Fighter 4/CoT 10 you had on the other thread was a bit better overall.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Nice build, and neat concept re: scythe wielding pally. FTR would get your AB up, but for a smiter, your AB here is normal (pretty good actually, you've access to many self-buffs, then there's that great smiting damage; only one crit smite being necessary <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  Agree with everyone that scimitar for more potential crits and shield use, but the scythe.<br><br>Perseus, apparently, was armed with a scythe when he cut off the head of Medusa!

Hey, Kail. Seein' as Grim and I were recently discussing your oh so nice reaper and the wonderful improvements you made to the Adept, just thought I'd pop by and post a link in here. This, so folks can get another gander at that rather amazin' crit smite damage of yours, (potentially xs 3 as you've 3 Smite Attacks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     and also to see what spells pallys get to choose from. As a 15th level pally, with 14 wis, you get access to some cool pally buffs (as in, some good spell access which, although vulnerable to dispelling and maybe not of the greatest duration, should still be of assistance to you in various situations/environments, &amp; thus shouldn't be so terribly neglected and/or overlooked). Ah, talk about reapin' devastation against evil forces - and talk about improvements!- just one crit smite, all ya needs is one! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    And if yer trying to convince all smiters everywhere to forget about that "big knife/greatsword" so typically associated with the class ... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   <br><br>Nice, Kail.

Evil beware, this one can dish enough to kill in one hit 98% of builds.<br><br>Well, if he were evil (Blackguard comes to mind) he would be death incarnated, that would be a cool concept, not saying this one isn't cool enough.<br><br>Awesome critical smite damage, but I agree for the scimitar, your STR is not high enough to take advantage of a two handed weapon, so a scimitar gets a better effect, aside from Crit chances and all, a scimitar wouldn't get the crazy 1000 crit power though, but overall more damage.<br><br>Great build, in every sense of the word <i>Great.</i>
