This is just some idle thinking, I don't have any real plans to play this, though if it can be done I might have to give it a go. <br><br>The chain of thought that led to this was trying to think of weird builds and I thought that something that requires three stats would be pretty out there, something along the lines of Wizard (Int), Druid (Wis) and Sorceror (Cha) (taking Cleric makes use of Cha so it isn't as bad as Druid... so it doesn't work as being bad).<br><br>I don't play casters much so I don't really know if Sorcerors can specialise, but I thought that if they can then combining Sorceror with Wizard would allow two specialty schools... so how about Necromancy and Conjuration (I think), then throw in Fighter for a Grim Reaper?<br><br>Giving it more thought I started to think it might actually be a good to make a Grim Reaper character by replacing  Wiz or Sorc with Pale Master, so I used the search engine and didn't come up with much. <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "252820", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Mestil's Pale Emissary</a> sounded damn good, and the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225040", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Doom Lich</a> also seemed to fit, despite protests in the latter thread that PM/Sorc/BG doesn't make any RP sense.<br><br>The BG really screams Grim Reaper to me, but the Doom Lich is the only combo of Sorc/PM/BG on the search engine. How would one go about getting 8 levels of Black Guard (to get Inflict Critical Wounds in order to heal Undead Summons) into such a Build without totally screwing your casting or dropping PM levels?<br><br>What about the Wizard version - Wiz/PM/Fighter(??)? How would you do this?<br><br>The idea for both is to weild a Scythe, use damaging shields and summon Undead servants.<br>_________________<br>Thanks for the thesaurus you gave me, it makes me not write the same words over and over and over again

Well if you want to be able to hit people with the Scythe, dont use the Pale Emissary. It is a caster build.<br>You will do awesome damage getting hit though. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br>If you want to use those classes and hit with the Scythe though, look another build by grizzled_dwarflord: The Deathless Pariah <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "202355", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> You will have to fit in weapon prof. exotics which shouldnt be a problem. You wont do much damage with the shields either. A lot of people prefer Weapon Master builds when using a Scythe for the damage and crit multiplier.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By galelabriel on 05/30/07 00:45</span></i></p>

I don't think the ability to actually hit anything with the Scythe really matters, it's mainly for show. Style points for wielding it in the first place, but also having something to swing that if you do actually manage to score a hit with (even with True Strike) has a chance of doing decent damage.<br>_________________<br>Thanks for the thesaurus you gave me, it makes me not write the same words over and over and over again
