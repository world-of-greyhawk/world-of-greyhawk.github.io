If you don't take them in a certain order you can't get some at all. That's probably why you never saw Self Conceal, you didn't take your feats in the right order to open it up.<br><br>I also think I'm missing how you're getting 51 AC... 10 base + 10 dex bonus + 4 RDD bonus + 7 tumble bonus + 2 armor skin equals 33 AC. +3 from a tower shield and +4 from when shadow evade is active brings you up to 40... but that's still 11 points short of your claim.<br><br>Based on what you posted I can only piece together the picture of a character with weak offense, above-average but not spectacular defense, and a reasonably good summon (the epic shadowlord).<br><br>Please only post builds in this forum in the future if you have their levelling scheme and accurate final stats handy.

LOL!  Come on guys, we were all young once too  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Ri, I appreciate the effort.  Here's some advice:  Look at the way cinn, xylo, griz, myself  how we post builds.  Do you notice some similarities?  I can appreciate that you want to list ALL the feats, but in reality, you are only making it very hard for ppl to read your build when you do.  FOr example, when you take Bard 1, most of us know what feats you get!  When you take SD1  we know you get HIPS, etc.   I know conformation is hard for some people, but here, it really separates the epic builders from the noobes.  JOIN THE DARKSIDE!<br><br>Now, WHy go rdd11? Is there somethin I dont know about the magic "proper" use of rdd (yes, when you make a statement of the "proper" way to do a build you will have to PROVE it)?   I find it rather interesting that you say the best way to use rdd is bard/sd!  Funny, I always thought that the synergys of sorc and pally mixed with rdd was a much better way to go (and there are ALOT of sorc/rdd/pals out there, including one that I have chatted with folks about and havnt posted).  I am looking, but I dont see synergystic relations with bard/sd/rdd.  now if you were usin wm/sd, thats different!   I'd love to understand what you meant when you said that.  What are the rest of us missing?<br><br>Peace

Thanks for the feedback avado. I guess thats the difference in the places we play at. Where I go, you rarely ever see a build like this one. Oh well, it did crummy in the Summits so I chunked; yes you can all aplaud that action lol. Hopefully my next build won't be so bad. <br><br><br>If Tomi was to leave feedback for this build, his exact words would be, "your ugly and you smell like a rotten skunk!"
