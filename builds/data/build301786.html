Jaysyn is a friend of mine that made this build and I found it quite the tough guy to beat. Please let me know what you think, I'm sure he would take criticisms well. Don't forget this one has Divine Might and Divine Shield so his DMG output and his AC will be off the chain.<br><br><br><br><br><b><i> ****************************** </i></b><br><br><br><br><br><b><i>DIVINE DEATHGUARD - BARD(6), PALE MASTER(30), BLACKGUARD(4)</i></b><br><i>Human, Neutral Evil or Chaotic Evil</i><br><br><br><br><br><b>ABILITIES (ending)</b><br>STR: 15 (26)<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 12<br>CHA: 16 (18)<br><br><br><br><b>BASIC STATS</b><br>Hitpoints: 414<br>Skillpoints: 190<br><br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 29/26/23<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8<br><br>BAB: 23<br>AB: 32 (melee), 23 (ranged)<br><br>AC (naked/full plate and tower shield): 32/43<br><br>Spell Casting: Bard(2)<br><br><br><br><b>SKILLS</b><br>Concentration 38(40), Discipline 23(31), Hide 5(5), Lore 9(16), Perform 8(12), Spellcraft 40(41), Taunt 21(25), Tumble 20(20), UMD 21(25)<br><br><br><br><b>LEVELING GUIDE</b><br>01: Bard(1): Blind Fight, Toughness<br>02: Bard(2): <br>03: Bard(3): Power Attack<br>04: Bard(4): CHA+1, (CHA=17)<br>05: Pale Master(1): <br>06: Pale Master(2): Cleave<br>07: Pale Master(3): {Darkvision}<br>08: Pale Master(4): STR+1, (STR=16)<br>09: Pale Master(5): Great Cleave<br>10: Pale Master(6): <br>11: Blackguard(1): <br>12: Pale Master(7): CHA+1, Weapon Focus, (CHA=18)<br>13: Blackguard(2): {Smite Good}<br>14: Pale Master(8): <br>15: Blackguard(3): Divine Might<br>16: Bard(5): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>17: Pale Master(9): <br>18: Blackguard(4): Divine Shield<br>19: Pale Master(10): <br>20: Bard(6): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>21: Pale Master(11): Improved Critical<br>22: Pale Master(12): <br>23: Pale Master(13): Epic Energy Resistance: Acid I<br>24: Pale Master(14): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR=20)<br>25: Pale Master(15): <br>26: Pale Master(16): Epic Energy Resistance: Acid II<br>27: Pale Master(17): Great Strength II, (STR=21)<br>28: Pale Master(18): STR+1, (STR=22)<br>29: Pale Master(19): Epic Spell: Hellball<br>30: Pale Master(20): Great Strength III, (STR=23)<br>31: Pale Master(21): <br>32: Pale Master(22): STR+1, Epic Spell: Mummy Dust, (STR=24)<br>33: Pale Master(23): Overwhelming Critical<br>34: Pale Master(24): <br>35: Pale Master(25): Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor<br>36: Pale Master(26): STR+1, Devastating Critical, (STR=25)<br>37: Pale Master(27): <br>38: Pale Master(28): Epic Spell: Epic Warding<br>39: Pale Master(29): Armor Skin<br>40: Pale Master(30): STR+1, (STR=26)<br><br><br><br><i>SKILLS BY LEVEL GUIDE</i><br>01: Bard(1): Discipline(4), Hide(4), Perform(4), Spellcraft(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4)<br>02: Bard(2): Discipline(1), Hide(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1)<br>03: Bard(3): Discipline(1), Perform(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(2)<br>04: Discipline(1), Perform(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(4)<br>05: Pale Master(1): Save(8)<br>06: Pale Master(2): Save(12)<br>07: Pale Master(3): Save(16)<br>08: Pale Master(4): Save(20)<br>09: Pale Master(5): Great Cleave, Save(24)<br>10: Pale Master(6): Save(28)<br>11: Blackguard(1): Discipline(7), Save(25)<br>12: Pale Master(7): Save(29)<br>13: Blackguard(2): Discipline(2), Save(31)<br>14: Pale Master(8): Save(35)<br>15: Blackguard(3): Discipline(2), Save(37)<br>16: Bard(5): Discipline(1), Perform(1), Tumble(12), UMD(12), Save(17)<br>17: Pale Master(9): Save(21)<br>18: Blackguard(4): Discipline(2), Save(23)<br>19: Pale Master(10): Save(27)<br>20: Bard(6): Concentration(6), Discipline(2), Lore(4), Taunt(16), Tumble(1), UMD(2), Save(2)<br>21: Pale Master(11): Concentration(1), Spellcraft(4), Save(1)<br>22: Pale Master(12): Concentration(1), Spellcraft(3), Save(1)<br>23: Pale Master(13): Concentration(1), Spellcraft(3), Save(1)<br>24: Pale Master(14): Concentration(1), Spellcraft(3), Save(1)<br>25: Pale Master(15): Concentration(1), Spellcraft(3), Save(1)<br>26: Pale Master(16): Concentration(1), Spellcraft(3), Save(1)<br>27: Pale Master(17): Concentration(1), Spellcraft(3), Save(1)<br>28: Pale Master(18): Concentration(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(2)<br>29: Pale Master(19): Concentration(2), Spellcraft(3), Save(1)<br>30: Pale Master(20): Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(2)<br>31: Pale Master(21): Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(3)<br>32: Pale Master(22): Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(4)<br>33: Pale Master(23): Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(5)<br>34: Pale Master(24): Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(6)<br>35: Pale Master(25): Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(7)<br>36: Pale Master(26): Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(8)<br>37: Pale Master(27): Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(9)<br>38: Pale Master(28): Concentration(2), Save(11)<br>39: Pale Master(29): Concentration(2), Save(13)<br>40: Pale Master(30): Concentration(2), Lore(5), Taunt(5)<br><br><br><br><br><b><i> ****************************** </i></b><br><br><br><br><br><i>Format improvements - Kail Pendragon</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/01/08 22:54</span></i></p>

First of all: please follow the 'rules' on how to post a build next time. It makes it much more easier to read a build :) <br><br>Second: I don't want to be rude, but what is this character supposed to do? I mean, he can't cast spells (except for Bard level 2...), and he can't be a fighter type with 30 PM levels. Why is the 30 PM levels? Just for summons? <br><br>I see from the feats that he is intended to be a melee char, but his AB is too low, has only 3 attacks per round, you lose one point of BAB by the pre-epic level distribution (6 Bard instead of 4 or 8) <br><br>I see he has high AC and the PM immunities, but I fear he lacks the power of offense.<br>_________________<br>"I will be the last...and you will go first!"<br>Sarevok, Child of Bhaal<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Praetor_Ghastkill on 10/01/08 22:13</span></i></p>

AB is too low.  You need EWF and prowess in there.  Even then, it's low, but w/ the killer AC, I can see it havin' a fightin' chance.  Sadly, offhand it looks like those come at the expense of two GRT STRs.  To still get Dev Crit, that probably means dropping the two CHA boosts.  <br><br>I would drop the last two PM levels for another skill dump (or two).  AC is higher, w/ a 40 tumble anyways.  You lose the Demilich, but... well, so?  I'd take the skill dump(s).  I would also <b>strongly</b> consider a maxed taunt.<br><br>Purely a playability thing, but I'd take Epic Warding in place of Mummy Dust.  Probably scratch MD and Hellball altogether for more EERs.  But, not a huge deal.

While he ain't gonna break any records in the slaughter department, he should be able to win just about every war of attrition.  <br><br>As for AB, there's only so much you can do when going for 30 levels of PM.  The max possible BAB you can get is by going Bard4/Ftr6/PM10 pre-epic.  This will give you a final BAB of 24.  I would drop Charisma altogether and shoot for a high strength and take Fighter as your starting level.  Starting stats would look something like,<br><br>Str17<br>Int13<br>Wis8<br>Dex10<br>Con16<br>Chr8<br><br>Keeping pumping strength, take Epic Prowess, EWF, OC and Dev Crit in Epic, and 3 Great Strengths.  Final strength will end at 30, and your final unbuffed AB will be 38.  Much better than 32.  I would dump Armor Skin altogether.  You won't need it.  Drop the Divine feats, take a two-handed weapon, and Improved Disarm to raise your situational AB even more against foes with smaller weapons, increase your Fort save by +1 and HPS by 40 to give you some more defense against nuke casters, and then you're good to go.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 10/02/08 12:44</span></i></p>

Starting at PM15, the character qualifies for Epic Spells provided they meet the Spellcraft prereq.  This happens in spite of your caster levels.  So, if he took PM15 at a general feat level, he can choose an Epic Spell.  He then can choose them at the PM bonus feats.  He can literally get every Epic Spell there is with this build.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Hey Flanderman. Good to see you adding to the community.<br><br>I play on the same PW as old Ned here and I hate this build. Between the ac, crit immunity and the UMD being used to pop spell mantles and acid sheaths, it takes the better part of 10 minutes to kill the thing regardless of what I log in as.
