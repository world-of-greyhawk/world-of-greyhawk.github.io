i noticed that most monk build are focused on kama or either both kama and unarmed but for server and RP reason , I need a monk that do unarmed combat as a focus. Since I hardly build a monk with unarmed , i am having problem with this type of build. I am not asking for a pure monk since i know the usefulness of having a bit mix of other classes in builds but if there is really no choice , i dont mind a pure monk too.<br><br>thanks

to max out the monk damage, you should go to around 16 at least.  if you want to be able to take advantage of other monk goodies, then up the level even higher.  you could take at least 4 levels of fighter, pre epic, to get weapon specialization on your fists.  adding some CoT will help in post-epic by giving you extra feats to put into wisdom, to help you get improved ki strike +4 and +5, but you would need to get a weapon focus in a weapon as well as unarmed, which may not be feasible.  you also might want to consider some levels of rogue, shadowdancer, dd or assassin in order to get uncanny dodge to hold onto your dex and wis bonus to ac.<br>i like monks, but they can be hard to build.  hope this helps a bit.<br><br>-C<br>_________________<br>Do not meddle in the affairs of Dragons, for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By christian.schnabel on 08/17/05 16:22</span></i></p>

Plus, they have a high wisdom requirement, higher than any melee monk is likely to go for otherwise (unless you're a cleric/ monk, you're more likely to go for strength or dex pumping).  Normally I think in terms of naked characters as well, but given the expense and redundancy of these feats, I make an exception.<br><br>Steve

I only mention it because the improved Kistrike and dragonshape for a druid 14 both require copius amounts of wisdom invested to make them work. The thread was started with the possibility of multiclassing. <br><br>In your spirit of unarmed (ehm, humanoid)combat I would reccomend a monk 33, fighter 6, bard/rogue 1. Good SR, damage output, and devcrit can be worked in if you like.

You can also throw in some weapon master levels.  Even just 7 levels of WM gives you +1AB over fighter and, most importantly, Ki Critical.  The extra +2 to your crit range is very useful for an unarmed build, especially one with Dev Crit.  You could do something like monk(25)/fighter(8)/WM(7).<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 08/18/05 20:49</span></i></p>

sure, I dont mind waiting , thanks for the infos and while we are all waiting, guess i wanted some more food for thought. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  So here is my question , is it playable to do a monk/wiz/PM ? the main idea is to get a monk that is crit immune but would the Pros outweight the Cons and if it is ok , would 10 PM be good or go till PM 16 ? <br><br>and finally thanks for all the inputs <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

I have a friend with that build on Athas Reborn in PW story. It has epic mage armor and warding in addition to the monk unarmored bonuses. The warding combined with the crit immunity makes for a nasty PvP presence. I think he made it strength based and went the devcrit rout. The only downside is the low SR (30 i think). High SR is normally a must for monk builds.
