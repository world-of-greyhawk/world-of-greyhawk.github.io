There are a few of this class combination in the Guild, but only one that takes enough levels of CLC to be in the undispellable level range. That build, by drumnbassjunkie takes only 7 WM levels, more FTR, and uses a scythe. This build takes advantage of the Club exploit and is only the second one that I know of to do so in the Guild. The other is an Assassin build of Finn's, but I feel Cleric is probably best suited to take advantage of this exploit since the club is a mediocre weapon at best, but the Cleric's buffs can make it quite effective. This build is based on one I drew up a long time back solely for the purpose of exploiting the Club. Of course, I've tweaked it and changed things from the original incarnation.<br><br>CLC 25/FTR 2/WM 13<br><br>Human, any alignment<br><br>Playable from level 1 to 40, PvM.<br><br>STR: 16 (26)<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 12<br>INT: 13<br>WIS: 14 (19)<br>CHA: 8<br><br>1 )FTR1: Weapon Focus:Club/ Dodge/ Mobility<br>2 )CLC1<br>3 )CLC2: Expertise<br>4 )CLC3: WIS (15)<br>5 )CLC4<br>6 )ClC5: Spring Attack<br>7 )CLC6<br>8 )CLC7: WIS (16)<br>9 )CLC8: Whirlwind Attack<br>10)CLC9<br>11)CLC10<br>12)CLC11: Extend Spell/ STR (17)<br>13)WM1<br>14)WM2<br>15)WM3: Blind Fight<br>16)WM4: STR (18)<br>17)WM5<br>18)WM6: Improved Critical:Club<br>19)WM7<br>20)CLC12: WIS (17)<br>   <br>21)CLC13: EWF:Club<br>22)CLC14<br>23)WM8<br>24)FTR2: WS:Club/ EWS:Club/ WIS (18)<br>25)CLC15<br>26)CLC16<br>27)WM9: GRT WIS I (19)<br>28)WM10: STR (19)<br>29)CLC17<br>30)CLC18: GRT STR (20)<br>31)CLC19<br>32)WM11: STR (21)<br>33)CLC20: GRT STR (22)<br>34)CLC21<br>35)CLC22<br>36)CLC23: GRT STR (23)/ Armor Skin/ STR (24)<br>37)CLC24<br>38)WM12<br>39)CLC25: GRT STR (25)<br>40)WM13: Epic Prowess/ STR (26)<br><br>BAB: +27<br>AB with mundane weapon: +41/+36/+31/+26<br><br>AC in mundane plate and tower shield: 28<br><br>HPs: 390<br><br>Saves (vs spells):<br>Fort: 23 (31)<br>Refl: 20 (28)<br>Will: 24 (32)<br><br>Skills (172 points):<br>Concentration: 43 (44)<br>Spellcraft: 39 (40)<br>Discipline: 43 (51)<br>Tumble: 20<br>7 points left.<br><br>Not much to say about it.

I know Kail posted a build with a single fighter level and EWS club. <br><br>That aside, the only thing worse than taking 7 WM is taking 13. 6 levels spent on 1 AB and 1 Feat, when more fighter would give you more than that.

Taking more FTR levels really wouldn't make sense for this, as you'd be better off going with a different weapon, since you could afford to take the WS, WF, EWF and EWS feats as FTR bonus feats. The 13 WM levels were to get the bonus feat for Epic Prowess. I could have taken 6 more CLC instead, which would net me another WIS and another CLC bonus feat, but Epic Prowess isn't on the CLC's bonus list, so I'd suffer a net loss of 2 AB that way. More WM levels would mean I'd have to cannibalize CLC and put the build below the non-dispellable threshold.<br><br>Believe me, I thought of more FTR, but like I say doing that would really make you want to go with a different weapon. This is the reason is sat in my build stable for so long, as really there's no good justification for using the Club exploit in almost all builds for various reasons (depending on the build). It's basically a gimmick build (as the name indicates), but it's quite playable as it is.<br><br>Cheers.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...

Thanks Mith. Not sure, but do you mean drop Imp Crit altogether or just delay it as the epic bonus feat when you shift the FTR level there? (just asking, as you have to take it to qualify for EWF:Club). Good suggestion though.<br><br>*edit* You know, Mith, that 20 levels of CLC pre-epic also has another benefit: you're constantly increasing your spellcasting power at lower levels where it's really needed. Good call.<br><br>Another thing occurs to me as well. If one would go with CLC 26/FTR 1/WM 13, and take that FTR level in epic for the WS/EWS feats, you'd gain another CLC bonus feat, which could be used to round the WIS up to 20. Of course, it means you lose a pre-epic feat though. Unfortunately, that would have to be Blind Fight.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 07/28/06 06:08</span></i></p>

I agree with Grim that WM 13 is not that wise a choice and I see your point about not wanting to cannibalize Cleric or go with more Fighter since it's a club exploit build. What about going heavier on Cleric though? Something like Cleric 32/WM 7/FTR 1 could go although I foresee some problems allocating stats/feats for overall playability (damned be the restricted feat selection of the Cleric).<br><br>My build exploiting the club bug is the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "233531", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Holy Nuker (Cleric 32/FTR 2/CoT 6)</a> it's WIS based and it was a spin off from my Holy Imploder build (Cleric 26/FTR 4/CoT 10).<br><br><br><i><b>EDIT</b></i>: I looked into it and Cleric 32/WM 7/FTR 1, turns out ok. All cleric preepic, AB 37 (capped AB 63), AC 28, final STR 26, WIS 22 (could be final STR 28, WIS 20, AB 38 if you accept to delay access to lvl 8-9 spells) just enough skillpoints to max out discipline, spellcraft, tumble and concentration. No BF nor KD nor EP, just one metamagic, WS/EWS at 24th lvl. Higher caster lvl for longer buffs, higher SR (44), higher mord resistance and auto penetration of maximum toolset SR, 1 more 2nd lvl spell and 1 more 6th lvl one. Cleric 31/WM 7/FTR 2 is also possible but looks trickier with feats/stats allocation.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?

True, but there's still Mords<br><br>Well, not taking Fighter levels just because that would break the exploit is a conceptual decision, more Fighter instead of WM would probably be the best though.<br><br>A good one it is, just watch out that HP.

Kail, yeah, there's probably a better way to go about it, and your suggestion is (as usual) top-notch, but I just hate to be another of those 'stop at 7 WM level' builds. Besides, it's not like there's <i>no</i> benefits from taking 13 WM...  *shrug*<br>...</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Yeah, I understand what you mean; I'm no big fan of WM 7 either, the feat investment is really heavy. I'm a big fan of a lot of cleric levels though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br><br>Also, I don't mean WM 13 has no benefits cause that ain't true. WM 13 after all grants a handful more hit points, +1 AB, 1 Epic feat and 6 more ki strikes a day. It's just that I like to get many WM lvls and <i>personally</i> I prefer to go with minimum 19 lvls to make that initial investment really worthwhile.<br><br>Nice build, btw.

To get WS(EWS) club you just need 4 BAB, leveling on a fighter lvl, having <b>IC: Club</b> and WF(EWF): club. IIRC EWF: Club also requires IC: Club,btw.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?
