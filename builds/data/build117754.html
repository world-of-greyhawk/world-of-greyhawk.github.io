I haven't even tried this build yet, sitting here at college. The basis of it is to utilize epic dodge, lots of AC, and conceal V in a melee character. The PW I play has gimped crit on bosses, and knockdown + sneak will do enough damage regardless. Anyway, the feat progression might be a bit off because I am not at my home computer to test it out, but since there are a lot of empty feats at the end, I am sure it will work<br><br>Starting Race: elf<br><br>Stats:<br><br>Str 14<br>Dex 20<br>Con 12<br>Wis 8<br>Int 10<br>Cha 8<br><br>FBF = Fighter Bonus Feat<br>RBF = Rogue Bonus Feat<br>SBF = well, you get the idea<br>regular = regular feat<br>R = rogue<br>F = fighter<br>S = Shadowdancer<br><br>You must level this up as it says to avoid xp penalty.<br><br>1F(1): Weapon Focus(Rapier), Weapon Finesse FBF and regular feats<br>2F(2):<br>3R(1): Knockdown RBF<br>4R(2): Power attack, +1 Dex, Dex = 21 Regular feat<br>5R(3):<br>6F(3): Weapon Spec(rapier) FBF<br>7F(4): Power attack Regular Feat<br>8R(4): Cleave RBF, Dex +1, =22<br>9S(1): Improved Crit(rapier) SBF<br>10S(2): Great Cleave Regular Feat<br>11S(3):<br>12S(4): Dex+1,=23<br>13S(5): Blind Fight, SBF, Called Shot Regular Feat<br>14S(6):<br>15S(7):<br>16S(8): Dodge Regular Feat, Dex+1,=24<br>17S(9): Any Feat SBF<br>18S(10):<br>19R(5):<br>20F(5): Epic Weapon Focus(FBF)Great Dex I(regular), Dex+1,=26<br>21F(6):<br>22R(6):<br>23R(7): Great Dex II(regular) + Epic Dodge(RBF) Dex = 27<br>24F(7): Epic Weapon Spec(rapier), Dex+1, =28<br>25F(8):<br>26R(8): Great Dex III(regular), Dex = 29<br>27R(9):<br>28F(9): Dex+1,=30, Undetermined(FBF)<br>29F(10): Conceal I(regular)<br>30R(10): Conceal II(RBF)<br>31R(11):<br>32F(11): Conceal III(regular), Undetermined(FBF),Dex+1, =31<br>33F(12):<br>34R(12):<br>35R(13): Conceal IV(RBF) + V(regular)<br>36F(13): Undetermined(FBF), Dex+1, =32<br>37F(14):<br>38R(14): Undetermined(great dex?)(regular)<br>39R(15):<br>40R or F(16): Undetermined RBF, Dex+1, =33<br><br>Make sure to have hide and move silently at the right levels so you can take Epic Dodge and Conceal at the right times. Yes, epic dodge is a bit early than requirements...I think that is broken. I tested many builds out last night and I was able to take epic dodge well before 27. As for the undetermined feats, I am sure some epic resistance would be nice, or some spell saves, armor skin, etc...fill it in based on how you feal the char is lacking.<br><br>I have a couple side questions myself. Does epic resistance stop all types of melee damage. For instance, if someone hit me for 1 slash and 4 acid, would it absorb some of the acid as well since it was on the weapon?<br><br>Second thing, about epic dodge. I've notice that Bioware's engine is a bit screwy in what it considers the "first attack". Technically, only the rogue's first hit should be sneaked, but I notice that the engine divides your attacks up into three stages per round, if applicable. So you have 7 attacks per round, and sneak attack someone, you will get 3 sneak attacks. So, I wonder, does epic dodge stop the that first third of attacks, or just the first attack of the round(regardless if it hits), or the first attack that will hit. And what about multiple simultaneous attackers?<br><br>Thanks for any replies.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 19:45</span></i></p>
