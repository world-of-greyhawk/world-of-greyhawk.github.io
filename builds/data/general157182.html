I found this build from an earlier post.  It looks intriguing, but my server level max is 30.<br><br>1.  How would you tweak the stats and progression of class levels and feats for a level 30 max?<br>2.  What sort of armor would this build wear early on if any?<br><br>Thank you!<br><br>This is my favorite melee build. She has incredible speed, six attacks per round unarmed, eight with dual kamas, natural immunities, damage reduction, great spell resistance, and high AC.<br>With Empty body active it's possible to sneak up on nearly any enemy then strike with Quivering palm. Sometimes this will end a fight before it even starts. A periapt of wisdom makes this even more likely.<br>Dealing with packs isn't a problem with flurry of blows, great cleave and dual kamas equipped. Even without a keen weapon critical hits strike often enough to end battles quickly.<br>Creatures that are immune to critical hits are often overwhelmed quickly just by the sheer number of attacks she's able to dish out.<br><br>Race: Elf<br><br>Starting stats:<br>STR = 15<br>DEX = 15<br>CON = 10<br>WIS = 15<br>INT = 13<br>CHA = 8<br><br>Level 40 stats:<br>STR 25<br>DEX 15<br>CON 10<br>WIS 18<br>INT 13<br>CHA 8<br><br>Level progression:<br>Monk 1<br>Fighter 5<br>Weapon master 5<br>Fighter 1<br>Monk 28<br><br>Skill Distribution:<br>Make use of saving skill points throughout character development.<br><br>Starting skills:<br>Discipline 4<br>Hide 4<br>Intimidate 2<br>Move silently 4<br><br>At level 40:<br>Discipline 43<br>Hide 43<br>Intimidate 4<br>Move silently 43<br>Tumble 43<br>extra points 13 (I put these into listen at lvl 40)<br><br>Boost Discipline and intimidate during fighter levels<br>Boost Discipline during WM levels<br>Boost Discipline, Hide, Move Silently, and Tumble During monk levels.<br><br>Feat and stat Progression:<br>1 dodge<br>2 mobility<br>3 weapon focus(kama), expertise<br>4 STR +1<br>5 spring attack<br>6 whirlwind attack<br>7 weapon of choice(kama)<br>8 STR +1<br>9 ambidexterity<br>12 STR +1, two-weapon fighting, weapon specialization(kama)<br>15 power attack<br>16 STR +1<br>18 great cleave<br>20 STR +1<br>21 great STR I<br>24 STR +1, improved two-weapon fighting<br>27 great STR II<br>28 STR +1<br>30 improved critical(kama)<br>32 STR +1<br>33 overwhelming critical(kama)<br>36 WIS +1, devestating critical(kama), armor skin<br>39 great WIS I<br>40 WIS +1<br><br>Level 40 info:<br>31 AC (no armor)<br><br>Main weapon: (normal kama)<br>+34/+31/+28/+25/+22/+19<br>1-6 +9 (critical 19-20/x3)<br><br>Offhand weapon: (normal kama)<br>+34/+31<br>1-6 +5 (critical 19-20/x3)<br><br>Fortitude 22<br>Reflex 24<br>Will 23<br>Spell resist 39

This is my version of a Monk/Fighter/WM. This one is dex based and matures early enough to work fine at 30th level. I'd call this build "Death of a Thousand Cuts" because it has good AB and AC, heaps of attacks a round, but low damage.<br><br><a href="http://www.intactic.com/zyn/nwn_builds/MonkFighterWeaponMaster.htm" target="_blank">Click Here</a>
