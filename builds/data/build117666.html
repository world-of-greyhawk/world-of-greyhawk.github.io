This is a build idea I've used on a PW server, don't know if it's already been posted *apologies if it has* I'm just not willing to read that much various posts to check. If this helps anyone, great!<br>Lich-Disciple<br>Half-Orc: Sorceror, Pale Master, Red Dragon Disciple.<br>Str: 20<br>Dex: 12<br>Con: 12<br>Wis: 8<br>Int: 8<br>Cha: 12<br>Starting stats.<br><br>At the build stage take the Power Attack feat or Light Armor Proficiency or Weapon Focus *Polearm class weapons for the best str benefits*, spell casting feats will not help you at all.<br>Take 3 levels of sorceror, spells and familiar are irrelevant although taking True Strike is recommended. Take the next Armor Proficiency, Power Attack, Cleave, or Weapon Focus at lvl 3.<br>Then 2 levels of pale master, after which you should have 8 points in lore. The rest of your skill points should likely be saved for discipline or you can use them for tumble.<br>After you have 8 lore, take 10 levels of Red Dragon Disciple, putting the additional stat point increases into strength. At levels 6, 9, 12, and 15 take the feats that you do not already have of; Weapon Focus, Improved Critical, Armor Proficiency, Power Attack, Cleave, and Great Cleave.<br>Once Red Dragon Disciple has been maxed out take all your remaining levels, until you reach level 40, as a Pale Master (25). Continue to put your bonus stat points into strength, or once you have reached 25+ strength put points into dexterity if you are using less than heavy armor.<br>Your ac will increase automatically every 4 levels after level 8 pale master, also you can take overwhelming and devastating critical relatively quickly. Your bonus feats will be spent on becoming immune to the other elements since Fire and Critical hits no longer affect you. With a two handed weapon 1.5x strength bonus to damage there is very little that will be able to stand up to you, let alone harm you when they do.<br>_________________<br>"Yea tho I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I shall have no fear.<br>For I am the BADDEST MFer in that valley!"<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 10/12/07 19:21</span></i></p>

at the time the server I was testing the build on was maxed at lvl 38. The build ultimately is Sorc 3/RDD 10/PM 27 = 40<br>Sorry to confuse  In the end the PM works off multiples of 4 for the AC benefits so the last 3 levels can go where ever you like. Someone I talked to went 3 more RDD for more hit points, and another went 3 more Sorc to get a few extra spells, like Find Traps. <br><br>Aerdoan <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 07/13/04 11:50</span></i></p>

To increase your bab you might want to start out with 4bard/6 PM/10 RDD pre epic.  Then take 2 more bard lvls near lvl 40 to grab a buncha skills.

I don't see the use of sorc in this build, and if you replace it with bard you have one killer build.<br><br>I would go 12 bard / 8 RDD pre-epic, finishing 16 bard / 10 RDD / 14 PM, you can never underestimate the power of lvl 16 bard song IMHO. the song and improved BAB easily makes up for the AC you'll lose by not leveling PM as much.<br><br>an alternative more in line with the posted build would be to go bard 4 / RDD 10 / PM 6 and finishing with bard 5 / RDD 10 / PM 25, take the last level as bard to max up on discipline, tumble and possibly UMD.

evo_dragon, you need to take 5 levels of Bard before you can take either prestige class.  RDD requires 8 prior ranks in Lore (minimum level 5 unless a server-specific subrace), and PM requires level 3 spellcasting.  For level 3 spellcasting with your CHA so low would require 8 levels of Bard before taking PM.  Keep in mind, also, that PM has the lowest BAB of the three classes; RDD and Bard are equal.  Thus, it would be best to take 8 levels of Bard, 10 of RDD, and 2 of PM pre-epic.  Nothing better is possible, unless you take Sorcerer, in which case Sorc 6 / RDD 10 / PM 4 is possible... but Sorc has the same BAB as PM.

In fast, you don't even need to be able to cast spells - only 3 levels of bard are necessary.
