I need opinions please, on which of the following is "stronger" <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br>All other things being equal; would an 11Cleric/3wiz/16PM or a 17CL/3wiz/10PM be the stronger choice?  The Cleric/PM is a Role Play choice; but I don't want the PC to be walked over like nothing if the RP leads to PvP... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>It is a low-mid magic world, no perm haste or anything like that.  I know the level 9 clerical spells would be handy; but going to 16 PM nets 2 Epic spells so that would be quite handy as well.  Either way brings reasonably useful summons, so it is kind of a toss there; though the PM summons are more role play oriented for the ideal. I am just trying to decide which would overall be the "stronger" build for general all around use, and certainly in the event of PvP as well. <br><br>What do you think?<br>_________________<br>-4SakN<br><i>"never kiss a girl whose brothers have knife scars." <br>"never gamble without knowing a back way out."</i><br>-Robert Jordan

Why not Bard over Wizard?  It would give you discipline and tumble class skills, not to mention UMD.

I realize Bard would make this PC more Combat capable; but it does not fit the RP of the character <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   she will be a Drow Yathrinshee of Kiaransalee; the Drow Goddess of Undeath and Vengeance.<br><br>One of the "requirements" placed on Kiaransalee's High priestesses is that they study the arcane necromantic arts as well as the divine.<br><br>She will be cross classing those skills to get at least a bit of protection; but it will need to be wizard for the build.  Any ideas on which of the above may work better?<br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world

Yeah, I agree Cleric 17 would be better in a PW with a level-cap of 30.  The extra AC from 16th PM probably would be overkill.<br><br>And P.S:  Sounds like a cool character. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By mantis3 on 03/20/07 16:09</span></i></p>

That was kinda my thinking too; but I can't deny the appeal of two Epic spells <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   <br><br>thanks for the input folks!<br><br><br>Oh and<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 03/20/07 16:09 (GMT) -- mantis3<br>And P.S:  Sounds like a cool character. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Thanks! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By 4SakN on 03/20/07 16:36</span></i></p>

Since you are most likely going to be walking around in armor, the bonus spells given to you by the PM levels will be buff type spells.  Their duration will be limited because of your low Wiz levels.  If you walk around with no armor, then you'll be using instant kill spells like finger of death, or flesh to stone, etc...  basically I would not count on the extra PM levels to provide many usefull wiz spells.  The PM summon at 16 is a lot more usefull then the PM 10 summon, but at your current character level, it still won't stand up for long in a fight.  You will get a few more  (4) PM AC points.  But I think having more Cleric spells and stronger spells will make up for that.  So... I'll have to also vote more Cleric levels would make for a stronger character.  Is 30 levels a set maximum on your server?

Yeah, this isn't for the server I have in my sig; which we are still working on getting up and running <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>I planned to take still spell for a few key combat oriented spells; but mainly I would not plan on the Wizard spells for doing much no. <br>It is a level 30 server though, yes.
