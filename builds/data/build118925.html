<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>Originally posted as a response to a request for the character with the highest AB with a melee weapon without buffs.  The paladin levels do nothing except for add an immunity to fear.  They were originally put in because I didn't realize that the Holy Avenger item property had been changed.

Could also substitute BG for paladin (as to me a half-orc just doesn't bring righteous wrath to mind).  Would still have the cha modifier to spells but also have bull's str, cutting down on the str from items needed.

My apologies, in seeing only the two pally levels assumed it was for the cha to saves as this is how it is usually utilized.  Originally missed the part about wanting immunity to fear <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_redface.gif">  Though the switch wouldn't hurt your saves as you still have the -2 from pally, and I'm assuming the manual is wrong yet again as it has bull's str as a 2nd level ability for bg.<br><br>Azclown

Can anyone answer the question about the holy avenger?  I can't seem to find any changes that were made listed in the patch change logs.
