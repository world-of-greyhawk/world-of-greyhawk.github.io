How about dropping wisdom to 8, start with con at 16, drop a great str feat, drop 2 fighter levels, and take 2 rogue or bard levels in epic for skill dumps?  Net loss is 8 hp and 1 will in return for 4 AC and possibly another skill you wanted.

There is one other tweak that would make this perfect.  The race is wrong!  Sorry bud, but you have been here long enough!  Its time to know the POOOWWER of the Half-Orc!  Sure, you loose a feat (like Kail says, some arent that necessary anyway), and you will be down skills (do you really need tumble?  Your a meleer, not some prancey dancey twirler!!).  LOL  <br><br>In my experience, the halforc really is a very advanced race to play well.  It is PERFECT for pure strength type builds.  This one is a very natural and easy fit.  It is my feeling that if you can build a strength CLERIC and make it exceptional to play with halforc, then barbarians should be a walk in the park.  <br><br>Some folks dislike half orcs cuz they is ugly.  The way around that is to wear armor and a helmet!  I played for so long and i never cared what my actual character looked like cuz i always was a gear monkey.  For those who RP, this is still a natural.  Besides, the charisma will be 6 vs 8..  not a big drop in the ugly scale.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 11/21/08 01:31 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>But don't listen to everything avado said... </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Let's see if this is less "pointless," then.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 10/22/09 20:36 (GMT) -- avado<br><br>dude, you should really chill.  it is in general that rogue/bard are sneaky.

People, in general, didn't build modules as well (combat wise) back when you were playing, so your experience 5 years ago or whatever doesn't apply to a decent chunk of stuff "today."  But yes, 4 AC and d6 damage for a cost of 1 level would be nice.

Personally I echo Onion's sentiment and to me it's evident that Rogue or possibly Bard is the way to go from a build's optimization point of view. Now if that doesn't fit the concept or the builder's taste (subjective factors), that's another matter; the objective value of the suggestion remains.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

Rogue/Bard skill dumps aside; I like the build and would like to thank Anuis for posting it. I believe the simplicity of the nastiness of this battle rager makes it refreshing. <br><br>In the server I play in there are relatively no hard and fast rules over any use of class or splits, but I recently signed on for an ongoing event which calls for no prestige classes. We are only allowed two classes for these toons and this fellow is a great example.<br>_________________<br>The secret to eternal youth is simply in your imagination.

Even as it stands though, without the obvious rogue/bard mix, there's no reason at all to not switch 4 fighter levels to CoT in it's current form.
