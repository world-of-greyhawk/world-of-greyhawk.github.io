Playable (level 1-40) PvM or PvP<br><br><br>CURSE BLADE (SWORD VERSION)<br>By Deborah Tyr<br><br>Based on the Arthurian Tales and old Celtic lore (the “fighting bard”), this character is a melee specialist, a solid melee character, built to perform under pressure. When a musician goes off to Knight School, it begs the question: is the song more powerful than the sword? The Curse Blade is neutral, preferably, but may be of any non-lawful alignment. The blade, for example, is indiscriminate, but a cold piece of steel; it is a tool that may be used for the forces of “good” or “evil,” or “neutrality,” only as directed by its wielder; when wielded by the Curse Blade, it is sheer poetic mastery. Music, in a sense, is also neutral: it is an art form, and stirs emotions in the minds and hearts of the audience, without regard to their alignment. <br><br>This build is an improvement over my very first character here in the guild, the Hex Blade (being completely re-tweaked for much improved playability, while retaining both versatility and utility (via UMD/scrolls). While saves may at first glance seem rather problematic, they should be “savable” as a result of his UMD/scroll access, which also gives him some rather nice access to other damage types, while enabling him to self-buff to cap. In addition to having this arcane touch, he is able to use those exciting bard toys, thus providing your Curse Blade with utility, versatility, and fun. His most impressive attribute, however, would appear to be his very high AB, and also the crit factor; as a high level weapon master with the strength to put out some serious damage, he can and should be able to make quick work of the enemy, even if the enemy should manage to make their save vs. dev.crit. <br><br>(Please Note: this is one of three builds in the “Fighting Bard” series; whereas the second build, entitled: “Blade,” has had its bard assets curtailed in exchange for even more combat prowess and dev. crit power (and thus a PG-Build), the Curse Blade represents more of a balance, in accordance with my philosophy if you will, between bard abilities (including song, spells, and early UMD/scroll access), and strong combat prowess/dev. crit. (melee) power.  The third and final character in the series, to be entitled: Song Blade, will be more bard-centered, with better spell access and including a better bard song/curse song, in exchange for the power of dev. crit. For everyone who shares my philosophy re: combat bards, and/or took the time to comment on my builds, then these Fighting Bards are for you!) <br><br>And now, without further adieu, I am pleased to present the Curse Blade (Sword Version).<br><br><br>Curse Blade (Sword Version): Overview--<br>Fighter(12), Bard(3), Weapon Master(25), <br>Race: Human / Alignment: Neutral Good<br>Hitpoints: 502<br><br>FINAL STATS:<br>STR: 16 (32)<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 11<br><br><br>Saving Throws:<br>Fort: 25, +1 Song<br>Will: 17, +1 Song <br>Reflex: 23 <br><br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8<br>Immunity: Mind-Effects (Protection)<br><br>Bard Spell Enhancements:<br>+2 Protection  <br>+1 Resistance <br><br>NOTE: Fully skilled in the use of magical devices (UMD), and thus can self-buff all stats, including his saves, AB/damage, and AC, too (for some ideas, see below).<br><br><br>COMBAT VITALS:<br><br>*Devastating Critical (DC):<br>DC: 41 (No Buffs) /  Assuming +12 STR (DC): 47 <br><br><br>* BAB: 29, AB +50/45/40/35 (NO Buffs)<br>+1 Magic Weapon (Bard Spell)<br>+1 Bard Song<br>--<br>+52/47/42/37<br>-- <br>+6 Taunt (i.e., reduces enemy AC (-6), thus boosting your AB in turn)<br>--<br>Total (AB): +58<br><br><br>Cap (AB): (i.e., assuming +12 STR and +20 Weaponry (or UMD/items)<br>+76/71/66/61<br>--<br>+6 Taunt (as explained, above)<br>--<br>Total (AB): +82<br><br><br>* Damage (Mundane Greataxe, illustrative):<br>1-12 + 22 (17-20/x’s 4)<br>+2 Bard Song<br>+1 Magic Weapon<br>--<br>(26-37); Damage on a Crit: x’s 4 (or, 148)<br><br>Can also cast “expeditious retreat” for a 150-percent movement bonus or, better yet, give him UMD/haste (extra attack = double damage).<br><br>Weapon Note: might also consider the greatsword with its wider crit range; alternatively, might pick up the scythe, with a xs 5 multiplier, for the delivery of even more crit. damage.<br><br><br><br>*DEFENSE VITALS:<br>AC: 21 (naked), 29 (mundane plate only)<br><br>Bard Spell Enhancements:<br>+2 Protection <br>+2 Expeditious Retreat<br><br><br>* SPELL CASTING: Bard(1)<br>Cantrips (Knows 5 Spells, Can cast 3)<br>Level 1 (Knows 3 Spells, Can cast 1)<br>Also fully skilled in the use of meta-magic (UMD)/Spellcraft (allowing access to some great buffs (STR, AB &amp; damage, AC, Saves, and also other damage types); in addition to giving you lots of “insurance” in the event of an emergency, UMD skills give you lots of versatility, and just plain fun (for scroll ideas, see below).

OK, IF you are totally uninterested in Bard Theme feats and Bard Spells, but instead want POWER (i.e., +1 BAB/+2 AB (or, BAB 30, AB +52), including the extra dev. crit DC point-power (or, DC: 42 (DC 48, capped)), then you’d be seeking Blade, who is the second (of three) characters in the Fighting Bard Series.

Author’s Note: <br>Why am I reposting this character, you ask?  Decided that I should, since the original post started off a wee bit confusing (well, terribly confusing actually, as revealed by the following:<br><br><br>* Comment I:<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/07/06 06:13:42 (GMT) -- avado<br>K please don't take this wrong, but the way you choose to post all the umd things makes for a very confusing post… All in all, it pains me to see such a beautiful build being presented in such a way!  The build in itself, without the trimings is GREAT!  The umd stuff is totally unnecessary. The taunt stuff is unnecessary.  Anytime you take high str and 25 wm lvls WITH bard you cannot go wrong!  <br><br>All I'm tryin to say is, … I'm just a "natural" guy <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">        <br><br>peace</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>* Comment II:<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/08/06 02:49:43 (GMT) -- Grimnir77<br>…I have to agree with Av here that all those buffs from scrolls/UMD should not be listed in the build. Add a line that states: and in addition, you got UMD, Taunt to lower opponents AC etc... We want stats from what YOUR character can do, where does he get hand of those scrolls? You are welcome to post the UMD AB farther down in the build if you like, but again I agree, you shame your great build by putting them in with the main stats.<br><br>Great build otherwise, though not exactly inventing the gunpowder here. Rock on.<br><br>Grim</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Yep: loud and clear everyone. And so, I did: I separated him out from all the UMD stuff, later on in the thread, with the comments on this character then being (i.e., no longer bogged down in UMD stuff, thus more inviting &amp; not so difficult or so time-consuming to read): <br><br>*Comment I:<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/08/06 16:27:33 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>Now that's more like it, UMD is ok separated like that IMO.<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->* Comment II:<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/07/06 10:41:11 (GMT) -- Kail Pendragon<br>Nice meleer, I'd actually go for a more standard FTR 11/Bard 1/WM 28, Bard only for a final skill dump. Otherwise I'd give up some skillpoints and start with CHA 8, STR 17 and change Epic Fortitude to another Great STR probably keeping Bard only in epic for a net +2 AB and +1 to Dev Crit DC.<br><br>Solid straight meleer, not really much more to say. UMD adds a lot of versatility.<br><br>Cheers, Kail</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br><br>THANKS, everyone. And so, a lesson was learned, about the way in which to post: Don't Confuse! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">       Seriously, most happy to repost the Curse Blade, in the manner in which I should have posted him in the first place: this, to ensure that there’s no lingering confusion, and to spare future readers the need to scroll down through the original thread in order to get to this one!). As always, I appreciate everyone’s comments, critiques, praises and patience on the Curse Blade, which is the first in what will be three characters in my latest series, entitled: The Fighting Bard. <br><br>Enjoy!

Thanks, Kail. I appreciate that. Yeah, in the words of all you wondrous critics, in the first post, I was "shaming my great build" with the scroll stuff; that everyone took the time notwithstanding to review it, I do appreciate.
