Silent Death<br>---<br>20 Monk/19 Assassin/1 Shadowdancer<br><br>Silent Death dashes into battle unseen, slicing his opponents to pieces with the fury of his dual Kamas. He dodges incoming attacks with skill and grace, and spells seem almost to bounce off of him, rarely doing him any harm. And in the rare instance that things get really bad, he leaves the battle as quickly as he entered, melding with the shadows to evade his attackers.<br><br>---<br>Starting Race: Elf<br><br>Starting Class: Monk<br><br>Starting stats:<br><br>Str: 10<br>Dex: 20<br>Con: 10<br>Int: 10<br>Wis: 14<br>Cha: 8<br><br>Skills: 4 Hide/4 Lore/4 Move Silently/4 Tumble<br><br>Feats: Two-weapon Fighting<br><br>---<br><br>Level progression:<br><br>Monk:<br>Level 3: Weapon Finesse<br>Level 4: Dex: 21<br>Level 6: Ambidexterity<br>Level 8: Dex: 22<br>Level 9: Weapon Focus: Kama<br>Level 12: Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Dex: 23<br>Level 15: Dodge<br>Level 16: Dex: 24<br>Level 18: Toughness<br>Level 20: Dex: 25<br>Assassin:<br>Level 21: Epic Weapon Focus: Kama<br>Level 24: Armor Skin, Dex: 26<br>Level 27: Great Dexterity I (Dex 27)<br>Level 28: Dex: 28<br>Level 30: Great Dexterity II (Dex 29)<br>Level 32: Dex: 30<br>Level 33: Epic Prowess<br>Level 34: Great Dexterity III (Dex 31)<br>Level 36: Improved Sneak Attack I, Dex: 32<br>Level 38: Improved Sneak Attack II<br>Level 39: Improved Sneak Attack III<br>Shadowdancer:<br>Level 40: (Final Skill point scores, all starting increased by 1 each level: 43 Hide, 43 Lore, 43 Move Silently, 43 Tumble), Dex: 33<br><br>---<br><br>Final Stats:<br><br>Str: 10<br>Dex: 20<br>Con: 10<br>Int: 10<br>Wis: 14<br>Cha: 8<br><br>37 AC<br>+38/+38/+35/+35/+32/+29/+26 (with Flurry mode off)<br>+36/+36/+36/+33/+33/+30/+27/+24 (with Flurry mode on)<br>30 Spell Resistance<br><br>Pros of this character:<br><br>-50% concealment (causes half of enemies' attacks to miss)<br>-Immune to Disease, Poison, and Mind-Affecting<br>-First arrow shot always misses (Deflect Arrows)<br>-Attacks of opportunity from combat movement never hit (54 Tumble)<br>-Very high saving throws<br>-Evasion/Improved Evasion means you take little to no damage from the likes of Fireball and other reflex-save spells<br>-Monk Speed means you always move as if you have boots of haste on<br>-Quivering Palm DC 32 (Fortitude) for instant death, once per day<br>-Heal self for 40 HP once per day<br>-Hide in Shadows to hide during combat<br>-54 Move Silenty/54 Hide means you're as good as invisible<br>-Darkness and Invisibility special abilities help with this<br>-13D6 Death Attack acts like Sneak Attack, but with a chance to paralyze your opponent<br>-If your opponent isn't paralyzed, Improved Knockdown sees to them being on their butt<br>-20/+1 Damage Reduction stops most nonmagical attacks<br><br>---<br><br>So in conclusion, this character is a master of dashing in invisibly, killing quickly, and getting out.

However, you missed something in your feat allocation - Shadowdancer requires both Dodge and Mobility, and the latter is missing in your build.<br><br>In the long run, it's probably best to replace Improved Sneak Attack III with Mobility, though due to its usefulness early on I'd probably get it in place of Toughness and pick Toughness up later in place of something else.<br><br>The only other thing about the build that I don't agree with is pretty minor: passing up Discipline and UMD in favor of Lore. Lore is handy and all, but I try not to put convenience skills into my builds. You can get Discipline to 23 in 20 levels of Monk, and with a little tewaking you can get UMD to 20 in 19 levels of Assassin.<br><br>I took UMD up like any other skill while as an assassin, but at level 37 I stopped putting points into Tumble (leaving it at 40), and put the extra points into UMD to round it off to 20. Then at level 40 I maxed hide/move silently to 43 and put the remaining 5 points in Listen, for lack of anything better to do with them.<br><br>If you rearrange the order of levels you can get Discipline to 43 (by taking Monk 20 at clvl 40), but that requires mixing a lot of things up and IMO isn't really worth it.<br><br>Anyway, a very intriguing build, which I'm in the process of testing. Just wanted to point those two minor things out.

I got on this build with the build searcher, and i think it's a quite good build... only REAL bad thing here is HPs. They are quite low for a meleer, even with HiPS and such.

So basically...you completely changed the build.  While I think it would be interesting to see your build, it seems significantly different compared to this one to post it separately if you're willing.

Improved Sneak Attack isn't just pretty useless, it's completely useless on a build that only has Death Attack and no Sneak Attack (since, unless it was changed in 1.69, it's bugged so that you can take it with only Death Attack, but it does nothing unless you've got at least one d6 of Sneak Attack).<br>_________________<br>People who say that I am arrogant are mistaken.

Unchanged, need a sneak attack feat from either rogue or blackguard to deal improved sneak attack damage (I haven't tested this with the item property sneak attack to see if that could trigger improved sneak attack).  Here Assassin has a large disadvantage.

You can also use debug mode.  Make a character and load it into a single player mod.  Type the following:<br><br>##DebugMode 1<br>##GiveLevel 39<br>##DebugMode 0<br><br>And voila...you can level it up to 40 and see if it's legal.  If you want to test it against stuff, using a mod like the one Kail linked to would be a good idea.<br><br>Edit: Sorry, that's an excel spreadsheet for a build template.

Dispels?  Oh, that is the cry of the player who isnt strong enough to care for themselves and relys on tricks and stuff like sc5 to attempt survival.  <br><br>Look at it this way when you are trying to decide IF sc5 is a big investment.  YOu need 30 dex, so just maybe a halfer or elf can hit that at lv 30.  That's nice, BUT you only are given 7 epic general feats!  5 is ALOT of 7!  Now, if you start at 20, that means you now have 27 dex.  Opps, you need 3 feats and you only have 2!  Starting to see the HUGE investment?  Yes, you get bonus feats and stuff which you must consider, obviously.  Oh, and you can get the EXACT same effect with a wand!  Yep, ill take the HUGE investment any day.... <br><br><br>*(can you see the humor in my writing??)  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/08/06 16:20:00 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I think avado answered your question like no other could... </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

As for ISA, I just tested and ISA feats work (deal their damage) even from the Sneak Attack feat on items.  Death attack sneaks are separately categorized on enablecombatdebugging, so you need a sneak attack feat to generate the sneak attack damage type to which ISA can then be added to.  ISA does not add to the damage type death attack. So assassins if they take ISA need to obtain a sneak attack feat from some source.

You're just whining for no reason avado. That just proves how much attention this build got. The build was posted on April 11, 2004 and the first reply was on May 4, 2005, over a year later. Only 4 replies back then and then it was forgotten until 2009, not much was said about the build from the beggining. So if you weren't there to be posting replies either, I don't see what you're expecting.<br><br>I don't know about old builds, I usually find annoying when the excuse to point something out is only valid on the newest version, but when it comes down to "old builds weren't as powerful as the new ones because no one was a proficient yet", well, I hold no special values for old learning trees, their time and usefulness is over. The build is not illegal with that, only bugged.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 05/07/09 20:22</span></i></p>
