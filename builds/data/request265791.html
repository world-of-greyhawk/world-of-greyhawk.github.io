High magical environments, spellcasters are great there.<br><br>Anyway, you want a melee, but give some more information, what is it you really want in your build? you say only WM, which can get a lot of varieties, supposing you need AB you could like something heavy on WM, say, a simple Weapon Master 28 / Fighter 6 / Champion of Torm 6 or the like, just pump STR up as much as it can be done and your unbuffed AB will be quite high.

Ranger 26 / Bard 4 / RDD 10 would deal very high damage, but I've never played on those PWs that have special subraces, not to my liking, and I'm unsure if Favored Enemy works good, since there are more races.

The Ranger's Favoured Enemy supposedly works on race, not subrace. I haven't tried it myself, but I've been told that if you're for example a Human with a subrace you're still a Human as far as the game is concerned, and will be dealth with as such by the FE ability.<br><br><br>Now I wonder if, with +10 to both STR and CON (I assume these are hard bonuses, not enchantment bonuses), it's possible to get Dev Crit, EDR, <i>and</i> Epic Dodge... There's something to try.

That's definately what I would do in this situation, go for all three abilities.

If I remember correctly that specific PW had a thing for Bards. The song almost had no limits! you could get 7 ac from the song or so. But really, boost that str 2tm! and go EDR. If you do that, then you're a bloody machine. Don't listen to the ED people, they are normally too skinny <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>Valkos clueless

Heh, i forgot about the subrace boost when I was making that build, it is a nice idea to go for EDR and Dev Crit, but he said no Dev Crit, it might go really well for a heavy Dwarven Defender, since there is no need to increase CON, STR would be high and defense will be covered, anyway... let's see how the Ranger/RDD goes, I consider a two handed weapon.<br><br>Human (for no EXP penalty, might be best to go Dwarf if you don't need playability)<br><br>Stats:<br>STR 16 (50)<br>DEX 10<br>CON 14 (26)<br>INT 14<br>WIS 14<br>CHA 8<br><br>+10 STR and CON <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>1 Ranger1 - Favored Enemy I, Luck of Heroes<br>2 Ranger2<br>3 Ranger3 - Weapon Focus<br>4 ranger4 - STR +1 (27)<br>5 Ranger5 - Favored Enemy II<br>6 Ranger6 - Blind-Fight<br>7 Ranger7<br>8 Ranger8 - STR +1 (28)<br>9 Ranger9 - Improved Critical<br>10 Ranger10 - Favored Enemy III<br>11 Ranger11<br>12 Ranger12 - STR +1 (29), Knockdown<br>13 Ranger13<br>14 Ranger14<br>15 Ranger15 - Favored Enemy IV, Improved Knockdown<br>16 Ranger16 - STR +1 (30)<br>17 Ranger17<br>18 Ranger18 - Toughness<br>19 Ranger19<br>20 Ranger20 - STR +1 (31), Favored Enemy V<br>21 Ranger21 - Great Strength I (32)<br>22 Ranger22<br>23 Ranger23 - Bane of Enemies<br>24 Bard1 - STR +1 (33), Great Strength II (34)<br>25 Red Dragon Disciple1<br>26 Red Dragon Disciple2 - [+2 STR](36)<br>27 Red Dragon Disciple3 - Great Strength III (37)<br>28 Red Dragon Disciple4 - STR +1 (38), [+2 STR](40)<br>29 Red Dragon Disciple5<br>30 Red Dragon Disciple6 - Great Strength IV (41)<br>31 Red Dragon Disciple7<br>32 Red Dragon Disciple8 - STR +1 (42) <br>33 Red Dragon Disciple9 - Great Strength V (43)<br>34 Red Dragon Disciple10 - [+4 STR](47)<br>35 Ranger24<br>36 Ranger25 - STR +1 (48), Epic Weapon Focus, Great Strength VI (49)<br>37 Ranger26 - Epic Prowess<br>38 Ranger27<br>39 Ranger28 - Armor Skin<br>40 Bard2 - STR +1 (50)<br><br>eh...
