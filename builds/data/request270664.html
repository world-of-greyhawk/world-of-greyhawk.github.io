I was planning on making a Disarming Monk. With 20/+1 DR, most enemies will not be able to damage you after a successful Disarm.(Most likely use a 2handed wep for the disarm)<br><br>So i had a Monk/ DwD build in motion. <br>Can anyone help this idea in motion? Or have something better than DwD?<br>_________________<br>Demons are Forever!

That's not 100% true.<br><br>A person with Stone Skin on have 10/+5 DR (on his skin).<br>When fighting unarmed or in Creature UA mode, your DR rating applies to your ability to overcome your opponents DR setting.<br><br>example:<br><br>A 1st level monk with no gloves on is punching someone.  He is concidered +0 in order to overcome the DR of his opponant.<br><br>That same Monk with Stone Skin on would be considered +5 in order to overcome the same DR rating.  He is NOT getting +5 AB or damage.<br><br>===<br><br>So, your statement is not 100% correct in that a Disarmed Person could still punch you and do damage.  But since they are a regular weapon user, the odds of them doing MUCH damage to you is slim.
