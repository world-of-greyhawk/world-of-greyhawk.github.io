Cooooool. That is helpful indeed.<br><br>Last thing that I probably should have posted about is saves.<br><br>Saves are often lower than what people would like, because most Melee are strength based and thus have low reflex saves. They also often have little use for Wisdom entirely, and will have low will as well. Fortitude is the only decent one because it is likely their highest base save and Constitution is more practical for them. So, what is a decent save. not average, but decent.<br><br>I would try and calculate this like you did Cin, but I don't know if saves progress naturally after 20th level. A Monk is 12/12/12, but does it get higher as a base in Epic levels?<br><br>Spell DC's are generally in the 40's and sometimes 50's right? So having a +30 to your saves isn't that good, but more builds often have less it seems. So I am guessing saves are often weak spots?

Saves are +1 in every uneven levels in epics. So you get +10 to saves after lvl 20. Saves can quickly become a weak spot, one that must be covered one way or another.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

Yep, what Grimnir said. A few things you can do about saves:<br><br>1) Grab CoT levels to boost them. If your build is focussed mainly on FTR and another class, consider replacing 10 FTR levels with 10 CoT. You end up with the same number of feats, but +5 to saves.<br><br>2) Save-boosting feats. Obvious enough, but if you have feats to spare, or can afford to drop a feat that's not really vital, these can really help out (especially the +4 to saves from epic feats).<br><br>3) Spellcraft ranks. Even cross-classed ranks will help, as every 5 modified ranks in Spellcraft gives you a +1 to saves vs spells.<br><br>4) Multiclassing. This takes some research, but it's always a good idea to keep in mind what saves are high and what ones are low for each class you're taking. Sometimes tweaking the build to take 1 more level in one class and one less in another by level 20 can result in +1 to one or more saves, while not impacting the build much at all in any important way.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I never end up finding the room for feats to spare. But I never really relized that CoT is essentially the same as fighter... only with better saves and abilities. Doesnt get EWS though. <br><br>Alright 'gents. Thanks.

Finn is right, actually Fighter gets more feats than CoT: Fighter gets a bonus feat at level 1, CoT does not. Epic Fighter gets bonus feat every 2 levels (same as pre-epic) while Epic CoT gets bonus feats every 4 levels (CoT 10-30). For a low amount of levels, Fighter will net you +1 feat from its first level, for too many levels, Fighter will net you more feats since it's always 1 every 2 levels, for 10 levels as Cinn says, CoT is a fine investment, that 1 feat shouldn't do much of a change anyway. of course CoT gets a great boost if your CHA is high to use Divine Wrath, so high level CoT is not necesarilly worse than high level Fighter, it can be a matter of taste or feats needed. If you take a heavy Fighter/CoT build you'll have tons of feats to spare.<br><br>Bless and Aid? that's from Paladin, not from CoT.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 08/01/06 04:01</span></i></p>

Just to clear up what I perceive may be some confusion: I wasn't suggesting one should take CoT <i>instead</i> of FTR. I was suggesting if your build has a lot of FTR levels (more than 5) that you replace up to 10 of those levels with CoT. This assumes, of course, that you aren't planning on taking another class as your third class. A good example of this is the build I mentioned: FTR/Rogue/CoT. Basically it's the iconic FTR/Rogue build, but CoT replaces some of the FTR levels (up to 10) at no loss whatsoever and a net gain of +1 on all saves for every 2 levels of CoT taken.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

The other thing to remember about CoT is it doesn't get the heavy armor proficiency and you need a weapon focus before you take the class, so it isn't a good way to get a martial weapon proficiency.<br><br>For the setting you described I would say a 52-55 with equipment and buffs is a good AC as was noted above.  Strength builds will perform better than dex builds, because you can't max out your Dex. A sword and shield build will have the same AC as a Dex. Build.  The High AC characters will be clerics, bards and PMs.  For the spell DCs I assume those are creature DCs or modified spell scripts because DCs don't get that high naturally.

Well, I have seen Clerics with DC 45-ish Implosions, and that was without too much magical gear so I took some sort of unwarented estimation to suggest they could get higher with more items.<br><br>And as for the Fighter/CoT thing that has confused people:<br><br>I rarely have a class to spare. If Fighter is in the build, I will likely already need the other two classes for something and personally, would not have both CoT and Fighter in the same build. I mean, sure, I could use both but I just dont think its overly fun to have two martial classes with essentially the same abilities, except for saves. I was just saying that it seems a better choice to take CoT over Fighter, unless Fighter is your base class and you dont have space in the build to make room to meet the prerequisits for CoT.<br><br>Whatever. I was talking almost to myself... though I accidentaly clicked Submit...
