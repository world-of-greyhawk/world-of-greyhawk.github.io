My first build, the Dwarven War Master, didn't use a Dwarven Waraxe, and I truly believe that a Dwarven fighter should have his waraxe.<br><br>So, here is my re-build of the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "198936", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Dwarven War Master</a> ...The Dwarven War Master II.<br><br><b>He is playable from 1 to 40 PvM</b> <i>and with the right magic items, PvP</i><br><br>He has been tested up to 40 so I know that all the feats are possible.<br><br>Any input is appreciated.<br><br>Dwarven War Master II (Fighter 10 / Dwarven Defender 14 / Weapon Master 16)<br><br>Stats: Start/Finish<br><br>Strength: 16 / 26<br>Dexterity: 13<br>Constitution: 18 / 21<br>Wisdom: 8<br>Intelligence: 13<br>Charisma: 6<br><br>Raise up Discipline each level, Intimidate up to 4 (before 9th level), and I split the rest between Tumble and Spell Craft.<br><br><br>1 Ftr - Exotic Wpn Prof - Dwarven Waraxe/ Weapon Focus<br>2 Ftr - Dodge<br>3 Ftr - Expertise<br>4 Ftr - Wpn Spec / +1 Str<br>5 Ftr <br>6 Ftr - Mobility / Spring Attack<br>7 Ftr<br>8 Ftr - Whirlwind / +1 Str<br><br>9 WM - Improved Crit<br>10 WM<br>11 WM<br>12 WM - Toughness / +1 Str<br>13 WM<br>14 WM<br>15 WM - Power Attack<br><br>16 DwD - +1 Str<br>17 DwD<br>18 DwD - Cleave<br>19 DwD<br>20 DwD - +1 Str<br><br>21 Ftr - Epic Wpn Focus<br>22 Ftr - Epic Wpn Spec<br><br>23 WM<br>24 WM - Great Cleave / +1 STR<br>25 WM<br>26 WM<br>27 WM - Great Str I<br>28 WM - Overwhelming Crit / +1 STR<br>29 WM<br>30 WM - Great Str II<br>31 WM - Devistating Crit<br><br>32 DWD - +1 Con<br>33 DWD<br>34 DWD - Great Con I<br>35 DWD<br>36 DWD - Epic Damage Reduction I / +1 Con<br>37 DWD<br>38 DWD<br>39 DWD - Epic Damage Reduction II<br>40 DWD - Epic Damage Reduction III / +1 Str<br><br>BAB: 30<br><br>Naked AB: +38/+33/+28/+23<br>Naked AC: 15<br><br>AB: +44/+39/+34/+29 (with normal weapon of choice)<br>AC: 26 (with normal plate and tower shield)<br><br>Max Hit Points: 668<br><br>Saves:<br>Fort: 27<br>Refl: 19<br>Will: 17<br><br>Differences between the Dwarven War Master and this one:<br><br>-1 AB <br>-40 HP <br>-1 off each save <br><br>Gets to use the Dwarven Waraxe<br><br><br>Everything else is the same.

It's not spam. These topics can be bumped by anyone if they're seeking more info on the builds. As to the gear, it would, of course, depend on the server: what's allowed, what's not, what's nerfed and what's not, etc.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Will it's the pretty good charactor creator mofule without forge of wonders. I think the max item enhancment level is +5 and there's not alot of immunity items. Dev Crit disabled. Time Stop disabled. and no corners to sneak (that's why i don't build sneak builds on that server without SD.<br><br>That's basicly it.<br><br>And can also someone tell a server/module that's quite often hosted and has corners to sneak around in the arenas and has a person or thing that gives you the experience to 40 and has good items on a gear wendor.<br><br>Kind Regards<br>Willwoms<br>_________________<br>Willwoms is the most super,  amazing, fabulous, marvellous, exciting, dangerous and lethal dex sneak in Life vs Death.Well will be eventually. *slits your throat*.
