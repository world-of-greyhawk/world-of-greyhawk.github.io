Circle kick is one of those some people like and others don't. Spring attack and mobility are fairly useless if you max tumble. Also if you took your 4th fighter level at maybe 24th, you could then use that as your last fighter level and take both weapon specialization and EWS on that level. That would allow two more monk levels and hence a couple more pts of spell resist.

Id rather have the extra attack from the 4th ftr pre-epic levels.

He's using unarmed, so he'll have five attacks.

Do you mean that I should start ftr levels later or take some out for more monk? If so, which ones in particular? From what I can gather, you want me to dump Mobility and Spring Attack (which are taken in ftr). So... instead of starting fighter at 16... should I start at 18?<br><br>I've been tweaking this build for the past few days. Have always wondered whether Mobility and Spring Attack were worth it. I've tried some different combinations but never seem to see anything I want to get in their place. It'd be great to get Overwhelming and Devistating Critical... but those are post epic. Which means That I truly do have feats to waste <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif"> <br><br>I'll try it out though and come back with the results shortly.
