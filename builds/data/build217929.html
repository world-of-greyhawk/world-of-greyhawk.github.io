This runs off of the Undead Dragon Skald <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "217763", "", ".", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>  This one has three epic spells.  You get Greater Ruin but you lose level 5 bard spells and the improved bard song from level 10 to 14 bard.  The skills is a wash because you get 7 more levels of 16 intelligence after losing 8 skill points for the 4 fewer bard levels.  Your fortitude got better at the expense of your reflexes (already very weak but you will be immune to a lot that reflex saves help against).

One thing. You can't have more than 10 levels from any PrC before epic levels. You have 12 RDD when you hit 20. Not possible. You have to move aruond around some PM levels. You will lose 1 AB in the process, but nothing else , I think.

i wonder, why take more than 10 levels of rdd?<br>i mean, its just another extra feat (and a little enhancing of the breath weapon, which is pretty useless), and if you really want armor skin then perhaps you can give up epic skill focus: discipline.

It gets you +2 AC from the increase in the Boneskin feat (so that offsets the loss of Armor Skin) as well as another PM bonus feat, which can be used for another epic spell if you wish.<br><br>One thing: you have Still Spell taken at level 34 as the PM13 bonus feat. I don't think that works. I believe your only option there is Epic Energy Resistance. I could be wrong on that though.<br><br>*edit* You alsohave Curse Song taken at level 15 (RDD 10). That won't work. You can only take Curse Song when levelling as a Bard (or as a HS bonus feat). Easy enough to fix: just switch your Bard 6 level and your RDD 10 level.<br><br>I would also suggest starting with 12 CHA. You end with 15 CHA, but with only 10 Bard levels, you can only cast level 4 spells anyway. I'd also drop STR to 16 and raise CON to 14 to start. CON 10 isn't going to cut it for a melee build. Then, drop that GRT STR I in epic. Replace it with Armor Skin if you want the extra 2 AC (assuming you make the change to take 20 PM) or Epic Prowess to regain the 1 AB you lose by ending with 34 STR instead of 36. Lastly, take 5 points out of Heal and put them in Spellcraft (raising it to 42). It will give you another +1 on your saves vs spells.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 10/26/05 16:25</span></i></p>

Ithacan: that looks better, but I'd still advise going with 16 STR and 14 CON (put the other 2 points into DEX). This is basically a melee build and although you have a really good AC, your HPs are only in the vicinity of 340 if you max every level. If you start with 14 CON, you'll at least have the potential for over 400 HPs. You only lose 1 AB and 1 damage.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

you lose one point from your AB and one point from your damage but you gain one point to your AC.  plus, if you elect to use a two-hander (like I almost always do, no matter how it looks in the build, I can't help myself), the 12 point modifier goes to 18 points damage while the 13 point modifier only goes to 19.

Not on my PW, anyway, or discipline.  Sneak and disarm are real big there.  Listen is dead useful, particularly for a bard (amplify +20).  But absolutely, build to taste.

Hmmm, Bard 11 gives you +2 AC on the Song, which would make up for the loss of the AC by dropping a PM level. However, it's only a temporary AC boost. But, the Curse Song would strip 2 AC from your opponents, effectively boosting your AB by 2 as well. And the level 11 Bard Song only costs 3 more Perform over the level 8 Song. It's a thought.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

You'd have to consider it.  You get an extra fourth level spell, too.  To cast and to know, which is big for the bard build.

Lasting Inspiration needs not-quite-epic bard (level 20) so he can't get it. He can get Lingering Song though if he wanted.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:. Only those who have known darkness in<br>(OvO) their hearts will see the shadows in life...<br>(|__|)<br>..".."..

Just a thought Ithacan, you should ask griphook to delete your original build and rename the subject line to match your very different, reposted build.<br><br>That's probably a better approach than locking this thread and posting your revised build in a new thread (since you'd lose all the relevant discussion).<br><br>Cheers.<br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br>Intelligent design is neither.
