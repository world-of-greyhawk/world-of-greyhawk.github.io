Does charisma give you anything at all? maybe a little more STR to carry stuff or to deal a little more... as well as you said, Wisdom might work.<br><br>Can't you take Armor Skin as cleric bonus feat instead of Great WIS so that you can take Epic Prowess? WIS 19 is enough to cast all spells (or 21/20 if you start with more WIS)...... net +1 AB and -1 AC.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 04/25/06 23:23</span></i></p>

Great minds think alike.  When I was building this to use War domain I thought a little charisma would be useful.  I like the idea of about using the cleric feat on AS - you'd get to cast your level 9 spells earlier.<br><br>Thanks.

actually this build looks very interesting for me.<br>sorry for digging out the thread, but i have a specific question about this character.<br><br>have you considered dual wielding kamas to do more damage?<br>since you can't use a shield at all without losing your wisdom AC bonus, you might drop some feats for the two-weapon fighting line.<br><br>these could be extend spell, i think the buffs are lasting long enough, there's no need to take all the metamagic feats, epic fortitude and epic prowess.<br><br>personally i'd go with plant instead of magic domain, i think creeping doom and bark skin are more powerful than ice storm and mage armor.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By dust7 on 03/24/07 12:52</span></i></p>

I don't think it'd be worth it to go two-handed.  It would cost you 2 AB on a build that lacks any fighter class.  If you are in a fight where you are only hitting on 20, you can go two-handed anyway to get the APR up.  Extended Divine Favor is a great spell; extended clarity, extended negative energy protection, etc., plus empowered ice storms and still heal/harm/greater restoration.  I suppose if you let go of the magic domain, you could let go of empowered spell, but giving up EP (!) to pursue the 2WF line of feats . . . seems foolhardy.<br><br>I like magic domain for the mage armor, the stoneskin, the ice storm, and the negative energy burst.  If I didn't go magic, I'd go War, actually.  <br><br>Cheers, <br><br>Ithacan
