My first attempt at an epic build here and I expect it to be a bit rough around the edges, so any criticism or suggestions are more than welcome!<br><br>Introduction<br><br>PvM build, playable lvl 1-40<br><br>The Soul-Bound Assassin is a feared butcher who enjoys creating carnage and performing random acts of senseless violence as much as completing well paying contracts. His only purpose is to harvest many souls for his dark masters before he himself is finally cut down to further their greater glory.

Interseting build concept and very interesting execution... but there are a couple teensy issues.<br><br>1 - your AB is just plain too low.  Try to find a way to bring it up to +38 or +39, +34 is going to make you a "20 machine" against a lot of epic enemies. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br>2 - your fort and will saves are critically low.  Like "fail every time" low.  As a blackguard if you have a negative cha bonus it subtracts from your saves, so you may want to consider finding a way to raise your charisma to 10.  Otherwise, maybe get some saving throw feats... I don't know, the truth is your fort and will saves have a very long way to go before they'll be much use to you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br>It's neat to see epic dodge in a build that also has a strength focus, but I'm not sure it's working too well for you in this case <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"><br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

I can't honestly what Blackguard brings to this build at all? Fighter anyone? Could easily access WF and EWF. Perhaps more.<br><br>Xp-penalty would be a pain, though. Is BG only there to get 4 attacks/round without getting an xp-penalty?<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 06/21/06 19:04</span></i></p>

Yeah, the Blackguard's mostly in to avoid the XP penalty, can't stand taking too long to get up to level 40.<br><br>I played this Character on a medium magic world (+5 equipment max) and there weren't too many uber AC foes to face off against, so I didn't have much of a problem there... <br><br>The only solution that I can see to the AB shortfall is to take more Blackguard and Strength at the expense of Epic Dodge and Rogue Levels. Could go with starting stats of:-<br><br>STR 18<br>DEX 10<br>CON 10<br>INT 12<br>WIS 8 <br>CHA 12<br><br>and go for about 8 levels of Blackguard pre epic. Don't know if I like dropping that much AC though... Max AC without magic would be 5 lower (using Studded Leather so you can still sneak a bit if you have to) and no Epic Dodge (which goes nicely with Improved Invisibility if your server is running a non-nerfed version). Still, concentrating on strength ends up with it on about 33, giving a total BAB of +40 including WF &amp; EWF. Sneak/Death attack still ends up at a healthy 18d6 though... and Imp Invisibility means you should still be able to hit most things at least once before they notice you.    <br><br>You can also get a fairly good AC with +4/+5 gear with the normal stats (I had Bracers of Dex +5, Monk Robe +5, Monk Boots +4, Tower Shield +4, Ring of Prot. +4, Amulet +5 giving total AC of 53 (from memory...) which allowed the Epic Dodge to be fairly useful) <br><br>The Cha issue was mostly bumped by potions of Eagle's Splendour, which eliminated the shortfall and occasionally gave a bonus. Still, you're right... the character is really weak against Fort &amp; Will attacks, I relied a lot on Sneak Attacks and Improved Invisibility against mages/clerics. Dragons and high powered Undead were horrible to fight against, but humanoid type enemys normally died very quickly.

Oooo...STRer with Epic Dodge...I think this is executed rather nicely, good job! <br>     Two suggestions here...As for the BG/FTR thing...For RP-Fun, I'd of course go Blackguard...For Full Strength though, I personally believe they're right about Fighter. This wouldn't get you the negative to saves, thought you would lose a 1d6 on your sneaks.<br>     Next is the saves...Now, this is STILL going to leave your saves low...But it might be a good idea to take 40 points out of one skill and cross-class spellcraft to 20...Only +4, but it's still better than what you have, eh?<br>     Overall, I think this is a pretty good build! Fun to see a STRer with Epic Dodge.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DragonRaider69 on 06/22/06 06:18</span></i></p>
