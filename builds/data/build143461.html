It was my first post in guild I made that mistake and apologise for not putting the levels in. As for the levels being wrong this is a mistake that has been copied and pasted over a long time. I should have corrected it  before posting it here. <br><br>Syrath

By going elf you take a 40 point loss so i just edited spellcraft completly out<br>to compensate for it.  This might make a huge impact with the extra sp in the early levels to help with cross classing skills.<br><br>I think the higher crit damage of the hand axe helps even out the damage curve from losing epic wep spec<br>against other players and higher ac monsters.  The only thing I dont like about either version is they take <br>a long time to mature into a better than average combatant.  The only iffy part i can see is skill point<br>progression I would have to test it when i get home from work to see how it pans out cross classing complicates<br>things a little bit. Anyway thanks for your time and thanks in advance for pointing out anything I messed up!:)

I like the build, i have only the following reservation . <br><br>The builds I have made were pretty much designed to be played in medium to high magic worlds. If you played pvp in these worlds you soon realise that AC can be made to become irrelevant as can AB. If everyone jacks their AC high enough dev crit no longer becomes an issue, and 2 fighters (dex or otherwise) fighting quickly becomes a 20 to hit issue. In this situation the dex build (with epic dodge and SC5) suddenly becomes the melee king in one on one combat. Statisically (and dont ask me to prove the possibilities) if you are getting attacked by a 50 STR RDD/Bard/PM with massive AC and great damage output with 3 attacks (4 with haste) you can expect to be hit only once every few thousand rounds (once every 100/200 or so rounds with haste). Meanwhile you can happily plod along hitting once every 5 rounds until your opponent is dead(providing you can survive the spells).  <br><br>The key to this is to get your AC high enough that no one can hit you unless they roll a 20. Losing a shield means you lose up to 13 AC. This can lead to a hit on 10 situation and then its a whole new ball game where the chances are much more opened up and STR builds actually have a good chance of defeating you , all because of losing the shield. That being said , not everyone plays pvp (me included) but the build was designed and developed for someone that did. <br><br>Syrath

Thanks very much the build does not work though simply because you cannot get hide to 10 cross classed before 18.<br><br>You are very much right about a shield the build was for a pw that is divided into good and evil so has alot of both pve action and pvp.  However I quickly realised that there is simply no way to account for not having a shield even when doubling the number of full ab attacks it really does not even out I was hoping self conceal and dodge would compensate for this but it doesn't really.<br><br>Just seems so wrong to use a shield with a dex based char for some reason though. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

You can get 10 ranks at level 17. Level 1 you have 2, level 3 you have 3, level 5 you have 4, level 7 you have 5, level 9 you have 6, level 11 you have 7, level 13 you have 8 ,level 15 you have 9, level 17 you have 10. <br><br>At level 18 you can take shadowdancer, you should try it and see. <br><br>Syrath

Early swashbucklers used strangely enough , bucklers for defence, this was due to the fact that weapons were not developed enough for the same speed of moves that more modern styles of fencing (by this i mean the early 1500s). This form of fencing is still in practice today by some fencing academies. <br><br>There is a perfect justification for a shield. For RP purposes I would say a shortsword would be more in order for this, since although the weapons of this time may have been termed rapier they are not what everyone would call a rapier(see numerous arguments about this subject not just on these boards but all over the web).<br><br>Syrath

Saving throws vs poison should be reasonable because of the fighter levels, certainly much better than most dex players. As to the will saves, there is not much you can do about it until you get slippery mind (shadowdancer level 7) at which point you will get the opportunity to reroll your save if you fail on certain will save spells. <br><br>Will saves are always a weakness for most melee players (monks being one of the only exceptions). That being said this build was built with survival in melee in mind(as pretty much any epic dodge/SC5 build is). It was not built to survive spells(it can rely on stealth to get close to casters if they do not have truesight). <br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!
