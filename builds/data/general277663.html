O.K. I have read your approved mods for the builds, unfortunately for some reason I can't get them working properly on my pc.   Are there any other mods or servers that you can recommend as I have a few builds that I would like to post, but can't as the approved listss don't work for me.

You can't get them working? strange, but if you mean you can't post the builds you want because you haven't tested them and you can't get the trainer module to work, just use the console command to raise your level and you can test builds in any module, the OC Prelude loads faster than other modules <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">     so I normally use that.<br><br>Hmmm, if I remember correctly, to use the console you simply insert:<br><br>`<br>DebugMode 1     [press enter]<br>dm_givelevel     [press enter]<br>[click on your character]<br><br>You can specify what level you want it to give you by writing a number after: dm_givelevel #, but if you don't write any number it will instantly give you max experience value.<br><br>DebugMode 0<br><br>To close the console.<br><br>...or something like that, I haven't really used it for a while now...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/01/07 16:26</span></i></p>

Hm.. from what you said.. if it doesn't show up on your mod list. So my first question would be, did you put the mod in question into the modules folder for NWN?<br><br>If you have not done that, put the mod in question in that folder and it should show up on the list of mods and you should be able to play in it.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.
