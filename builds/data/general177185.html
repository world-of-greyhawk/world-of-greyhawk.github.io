Ki strike stops at Ki strike 3 through normal monk progression (lvl 16 monk). You can choose the feats Improve Ki Strike 4 and 5 once you hit lvl 21+, ki strike 3 and wis 21+ prereqs.<br><br>Brandon

you only need Ki strike +5 if the server you play has no monk gloves that goes beyond +4 AB bonus.<br><br>and if you need it, it is preferable to do it with a starting wis at 16 and then use 10 COT lvls to gain +5 wis. it mixes well with dex so ED isnt all that hard to come by.

Pure monk cant get ED (epic dodge, if thats what you mean). It needs rogue or shadowdancer for defensive roll.<br><br>Syrath

Agreed, its worth taking 5 levels SD or 10 levels rogue to get Defensive roll for a DEX based monk to qualify for epic dodge<br><br>Syraht
