Why the 18 int?  I can see you pumping dex, as that is that doesnt get over written by Mino shape, just wondering why you wouldnt go higher wis instead of int.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

Wisdom really isn't used as all I have is 3rd level spells, with a caster level of 6.  I guess starting with a 18 in dex, and 14 in int would be better.

I also forgot to ask about you taking Undead feat.  I dont have my manual here (at work) but I thought that there was a minimum wis score you had to have to take that.  It is also my understanding that wisdom does affect your shapes that you shift into, at least the DC for some of the special feats they have.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

Maybe you could tone drop a few Dwarven Defender levels so you could get Death Ward....?

I now realize that I was thinking of Outsider Shape that you needed a minimum Wis score of 25 for.  Undead shape, you just have to be an epic shifter.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

The risen only gets 21 con.<br><br>But also a dwarven defender/risenlord is nothing compared to the barbarian/druid/shifter.<br>The barbarian gets max AB from lvls to 20 and even gets okay DR without the DwD lvls. but the neet stuff lies in the taunt ability of the barb. also you should go for mighty rage so pump your str and con to 21. then you have anice tank. much better than the DwD/risen tank.

A couple things I noticed. First off doesn't shifter get the epic greater wildshape forms at level 13? If so those two more shifter levels would greatly pay off. Also you could drop druid down to 5 levels. <br><br>That leaves you with a 5 druid/13 shifter/22 DD.<br><br>I also like Barbarian instead of DD in this style build. I may have to toy with that idea.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

The 13th level of shifter just gets you infinite humaniod shapes, which for this build I didn't use very much.  I did the extra druid level for maxed spellcraft.  I tried alittle with the Barbarian, but I like the increased damage reduction from DwD
