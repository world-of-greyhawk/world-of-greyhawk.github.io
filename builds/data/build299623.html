Why int 14?  For skills?  I ask because taking int 14 when you do delays taking dev crit ALOT.  Just my preference though.<br><br>the other thing is you take imp disarm and called shot in epic lvls.  THis usually indicates that the builder is looking to fill feat slots, so takes things that are throwaway feats.  I understand that imp disarm and call shot have uses, i just have never found the use for them in my years of playing.  I mention this because you are handicapping your build buy doing this.  Keeping everything else the same, taking wm22 instead of fighter 21 gives more AB (which you state IS the reason you took WM).  You loose feats, but like i said, they arent the most critical ones.  THe other thing that would be intersting would be the addition of 2 Epic Toughness feats (for wm bonus feats).  <br><br>There are other things i would do, but they are all designed to get dev crit earlier.  <br><br>All in all, the build is good.  Afterall, how could it not be, being fighter wm!<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Thnx, I changed Called shot for Epic prowess to boost AB by +1. <br>I love versability and the best way to end fight is to grab opponent압 weapon <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Yeah INT 14 is just for skills<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By SamElanius on 07/31/08 15:11</span></i></p>

Start with these stats:<br><br>STR 17<br>DEX 14<br>CON 12<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 8<br><br>You have one point left. Put it in CON, WIS, or CHA, whichever you fancy. Instead of raising INT at level 20, just raise STR at every stat boost. Same net effect for STR, but you end up with more skill points from the get-go.<br><br>I'd also suggest dropping that 21st level of FTR and picking up another Rogue. This will allow you to spread your 4 Rogue levels around a bit to do some regular skill dumping.<br><br>I know this would lead to a loss of 1 BAB, but I'd really consider taking at least one Rogue level pre-epic (and possibly two). This will give you earlier skill dumps and will make the character far more playable from the ground up. Having ranks in UMD before level 22 will give your character far more versatility and survivability and be worth way more than that extra 1 BAB, IMO.<br><br>I'm also in the camp that feels there's no need for both Spot and Listen. I'd max one only and put the saved skill points into something else.<br><br>Improved Disarm so late in the build? I'd try to fit it in far earlier. Disarm is pretty untenable alone, especially when not using a large weapon. I'd also seriously consider Avado's advice and drop the Disarm feats altogether and go with more WM. And look at trying tog et Dev Crit ealrier.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

THis is why i LOVE being part of this guild.  Cinn is great!  He mentins taking 4 rogue, with one pre which looses you 1 ab.  You can make up for that with the increase in WM lvls!
