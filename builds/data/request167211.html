This isn't the forum for designing build. Thsi is a resource forum to get info on how NWN classes work. Outside that, I don't think anyone has posted anything in the build forums calling it a psionisist. The closest thing to psionics in NWN is a shifter in mindflayer form using those abilities.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

why is this stickied ?!?!?!<br>_________________<br>They were all dead. The final gunshot was an exclamation mark to everything that had led up to this point. I released my finger from the trigger. And then it was all over. The storm seemed to lose its frenzy. The ragged clouds gave way to the stars above.
