Looking for a build that gives the highest death attack possible. Can anyone point me into the right direction? This would be for PVP.

When you say 'Death Attack' do you mean the assassin's ability Death Attack? <br><br>Have you looked through the list of builds for any assassin builds? Also, there was a Bioware Wednesday epic character that was an assassin: The Dark Stalker<br><br><a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_darkstalker.html" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br>Kaliban

The DC on the paralyze on death attack is INT based.. Get it high and you will have a quite deadly character.. Your biggest enemy would be low AB.. so I would maybe have gone a couple of fighter(or maybe monk) lvls before you hit epic, and one SD lvl for HIPS..

10ranger/29assassin/1barb does pretty well since assassins get great dexternity as a feat. you'll have +3ab against favoured enemies aswell. And like said before, get decent inteligence and you should get a high dc. The one barbarian level just lets you max your discipline and gives you a rage and 10% faster movement but lowers your dc of death attack with 1.

Make a bard/fighter/Assassin:<br><br>I've done this for PvP before:  I did about 10/5/25, with a 12 int, I think I got a 44 death attack DC with gear, but out server was limited to +5 weapons so the DC was chosen to be still decent.<br><br>I would recommend  think is 4 bard/6 fighter/10 Assassin (bab=3+6+7=16)<br><br>Bard gives a hide and MS to take assassin, darkness and ultravision, why? All attacks in darkness are death attack for 'dmg' and will get a stun chance if the opponent is standing there not attacking you in the first round.  Plus you can hide again in the darkness.  Makes for great hit and run tactics for surprise. Which really is the Assassin's greatest chance. <br><br>Fighter increases AB and # of attacks, so you can get epic weapon spec or dual wield feats or both.<br><br>So concentrating on Death attack Dc recommended stats:<br><br>(race not included, but I'd go elf for higher base dex switch str and con)<br><br>Str: 12<br>Dex: 16<br>Con: 10<br>Wis: 8<br>Int: 16<br>cha: 12<br><br>Then I'd raise my intelligence by 6 points minimum with stats and The rest Dex and Great Dex for to hit, you will get <br><br>Improved sneaks are nice but if they are stunned, who cares, and with 7 attacks (figuring in haste), That gives the first attack sequence 3 chances for a fail on Death Attack Paralyze (because of the 3 flurries per combat round attacks are broken up into, 3/2/2)<br><br>With +12 gear and taking int (base 22)=34 = 10+12+30=52 Death attack paralyze. Not bad, but will lack some ab.<br><br>It's fun, I wouldn't personally choose 4/6/30, as it's more effective to have about 8 bard levels, cut back on Assassin dc a bit but overall more effective.

how about<br>Druid 5/Shifter 17/Assassin 18 -- shifter 13/assassin 22 would also work, and use kobold comander shape.  Level 17 is when you get epic kobold shape.
