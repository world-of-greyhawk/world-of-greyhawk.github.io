Avenging Commando with Elf Ears <br><br>This will be more or less immune to Dev Crit with the high fortitude saves, more or less immune to area-affect spells with the high reflex save, more or less immune to mind-affecting spells with the high will save.  Effective against HIPSters with the High Listen Skill and Elf active modal detect.  Effective against Melee with the High AC and Epic Taunt Skill (DC of 52 against Concentration skill check).  It's high enough such that even a caster may have a problem resisting the Taunt.  Heaven help you if he knocks you down with the sneaks (7d6) and the Crippling Strike.  Being knocked down and disarmed are his weaknesses, countered only with his high AC (no discipline as I couldn't get it anywhere near his AC).  So first strike will be important, as always.  UMD enables use of invisibility scrolls for that purpose.  Uncanny dodge means he'll keep his AC in mobs or flatfooted.  Which is nice. <br><br>Any, here is the latest in the Avenging Commando series.

Here, again, we have issues dealing with dex-based characters.  This is by no means to rip on you, Ithacan, as you've been established here for quite some time, and I give you the utmost respect.  However, I think the Dwarflord is going to have to host a clinic.  <br><br>Now, if this is meant to be a level 40 PvP build, have at it.  As it stands, its from 1-40, so I must treat it as such.<br><br>First, Dex-based, but no Uncanny Dodge until Level25.  Since you have an <b>8</b> strength, I have to assume that you aren't really wearing Full Plate and Towershield.  Therefore, for the most precious portion of this character's career, he's a sitting duck.  Sure, he has Divine Shield, but it's not like he's turning any heads with that 14 Charisma, and at the end of the day Divine Shield is still Dodge AC.  This means, when you are losing all that Dex AC when Flatfooted, you're also losing all your Dodge AC.  And that's if it's even on since the duration is so limited.  The 12 Con isn't doing him any favors, but I suppose its the best you could afford in the circumstances.<br><br>Am I correct in seeing that DS is taken at Lvl18? That makes the above paragraph even more significant, as I'm not sure how he is to survive those tough combat encounters.  <br><br>Further, the 8 strength insures that he's not going to hurt anybody, and one could almost make the argument that Divine Might is more important than Shield in those early levels.  <br><br>Also, Dex-based, but no HiPS, no Epic Dodge, no Self Concealment?  Your list of allies grows thin. You acquire 13 lvls of Rogue, yet no ED?  You have to ask yourself this:  (i)What would you rather have?  Crippling Strike and ESF: Listen, or Improved Evasion, Defensive Roll, and Epic Dodge?  <br><br>At this point, why not just go strength-based?  It would solve 2 of your biggest problems:  damage output and not having to worry about UD.  The other option, of course, is to Chr-based.  <br><br>I guess I'm also trying to figure out why you wait until Lvl 22 to take your first Rogue level.  Is it to avoid the xp penalty for as long as possible, or to max your BAB?  If it's the former, I would eat the penalty, and if it's the latter, I would slap in 4 Rogue pre-epic and still eat the penalty.  Just for evasion, UD and UMD alone is worth the penalty, not to mention the other skills and some possible sneak damage.<br><br>My conclusion:  if you're going Dex-based, get UD and ED as soon as possible.  If you can't get that, go Str or Chr based, or a little bit of both.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

One (hopefully) final tweak, to the skills.  With the saves so high and UMD for scroll use, I think you can forgo any spellcraft, given that it comes 2/1, and max out Spot to really make the most of your elf modal detect.  So:<br><br>Skill (249): <br><br>UMD: 23 <br>Spot: 43<br>Tumble: 40 <br>Listen: 42 <br>Heal 36 <br>Taunt: 40<br>O/L: 2/1 <br>Set: 20 <br>Disable: 2/1 <br>Pick Pocket: 1 <br><br>Obviously, that can be debated.  But Spot comes 1 for 1, Spellcraft comes 2 for 1, and your saves with this build are really high.  And spot can be useful on a PW that hides boss items behind trap doors and such.<br><br>Cheers.

I'm starting to get a little confused here, I think I'm repeating stuff said on another of your builds.<br><br>As I said on the STR version, 14 CHA is just low with Divine Shield/Might/Wrath (+5 on Divine Wrath this time, not +3 as you wrote), give it a little more CHA me says.<br><br>Divine Wrath's power is +3 at level 5, and +2 every 5 levels after that.<br><br>Just 1 Rogue level doesn't makes it playable all of a sudden, at level 25...well, some enemies will have DR already by level 25, I'd say his damage is playable from level 31...<br><br>I will say it's good at level 40, do not infer my message.
