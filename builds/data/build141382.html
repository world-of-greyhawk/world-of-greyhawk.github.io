<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM</b><br><br>Here is one of the scariest little halfling you'll ever see. It is a build meant to take advantage of panic to land a lot of sneak attacks via terrifying rage.<br><br>Race: Halfling (Ghostwise if you want an RP reason)<br>Class: Rogue ---&gt;17 Rogue/21 Barbarian/2 Shadowdancer<br>STR 12<br>DEX 18-&gt;26<br>CON 12-&gt;14<br>INT 14<br>WIS 10<br>CHA 10<br><br>Skills (while levelling barbarian keep discipline maxed, when levelling rogue keep tumble maxed and try to put one pt into each of the other skills):<br>Disable Trap: 30<br>Discipline: 43<br>Hide: 35<br>Intimidate: 43 (53 with epic skill focus)<br>Move Silenty: 35<br>Open Lock: 30<br>Search: 20<br>Spot: 30<br>Tumble 40<br>Use Magic Device: 30<br><br>Feats taken are: <br>Dodge, Weapon finesse, Weapon Focus-Dagger, Two weapon fighting, Ambidexterity, Mobility, Improved Critical-Dagger, Improved Two Weapon Fighting, Epic Weapon Focus-Dagger, Epic Dodge, Epic Skill Focus-Intimidate, Terrifying Rage, Armor Skin.<br><br>Thieve feats are:<br>Defensive Roll, Improved Evasion, Slippery Mind<br><br>Other useful abilities: Two levels of SD gives HIPS and darkvision. At 21 Barbarian he has damage reduction 4 (not much, but still some). With Greater Rage you can do a substatial aount of damage to bypass any moderate reduction (I had no problem killing mithral golems when raged). Uncanny dodge is at VI. Sneak attack is at 9d6.<br><br>The character I rolled has 450 HP which is not to bad for a dex build, especially with moderate damage reduction, topped off with epic dodge.<br><br>Saves were 25 fort, 32 reflex, 17 will (hence slippery mind is very important).<br><br>Weaknesses are only moderate saves,no (or low) concentration and lower damage rates vs sneak attack immune opponents. <br><br>Anything not immune to fear will most likely get shredded before they can respond, and a 53 DC fear save is very high for anything.<br><br>Some tweaks for personal preference is you could make it human and use short swords. This means gettign epic dodge a couple levels later though, but you can start with your CON at 14. You could also drop SD levels and go 19 rogue. This will get you another d6 on sneak attack as well as another thief feat. I opted for HIPS and a little comedic value ina scary halfling.<br><br>All in all it's fun and a little out of the ordinary being that it's a barbarian.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 08/03/05 20:47</span></i></p>

This sounds pretty cool.  Any chance we could get a level breakdown -- where you took feats, skills, etc?

Skills are pretty much just keep disc capped on barbarian levels and tumble on rogue levels, and intimidate on both. The other rogue skills are basically adding 1-2 pts per level as available. Start with all the listed rogue skills capped. The feats are taken in the order listed. It's pretty open though as there is no real requirement to take any at a certain point. The rogue feats were taken in the order listed as well.<br><br>As far as levelling I just went a basic one for one for the most part until I hit 30s. then it was key to take the 17th level of rogue at48 or 39 and the 21st barb level at 40. The two shadowdancer levels can be worked in wherever you wish (I took them as soon as it was available).
