Ok, now for a Divine Warrior, which can handle Crit Immune creatures with ease and practically never fails a saving throw. <br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Stats:<br>Str 14<br>Dex 10<br>Con 14<br>Int 10<br>Wis 12<br>Cha 16<br><br>Stat Progression:<br>Charisma every chance<br><br>Skill Progression:<br>Persuade, Heal, Discipline maxed out.<br><br>Level Progression:<br>3 * Fighter<br>3 * Paladin<br>1 * Fighter<br>1 * Champion of Torm<br>1 * Paladin<br>2 * Champion of Torm<br>1 * Paladin<br>6 * Champion of Torm<br>1 * Fighter<br>1 * Paladin<br>1 * Champion of Torm<br>3 * Fighter<br>16 * Champion of Torm<br><br>Feat Progression:<br>1, Luck of Heros, Strong Soul, Weapon Focus (Longsword) (Fighter 1)<br>2, Power Attack (Fighter 2)<br>3, Iron Will<br>6, Divine Might<br>7, Weapon Specialisation (Longsword) (Fighter 4)<br>9, Divine Shield<br>10, Cleave (CoT 2)<br>12, Extra Turning<br>13, Improved Critical (Longsword) (CoT 4)<br>15, Toughness, Great Cleave (CoT 6)<br>17, Blind Fight (CoT <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif">   <br>18, Extra Smiting <br>21, Great Charisma I, Epic Weapon Focus (Longsword) (CoT 10)<br>22, Epic Weapon Specialisation (Fighter 6)<br>24, Great Charisma II, Armour Skin (Fighter <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif">   <br>27, Great Charisma III<br>28, Great Smite I (CoT 14)<br>30, Great Charisma IV<br>32, Great Smite II (CoT 18)<br>33, Great Charisma V<br>36, Great Charisma VI, Great Smite III (CoT 22)<br>39, Great Charisma VII<br>40, Great Smite IV (CoT 26)<br><br>The character ends up as:<br>Fighter 8 / Paladin 6 / Champion of Torm 26<br><br>with stats:<br>Str 14<br>Dex 10<br>Con 14<br>Int 10<br>Wis 12<br>Cha 33<br><br>This character is both a bastion of defense and an unresistable attacker.<br><br>It is heavily armoured with Full Plate and a Tower shield and magical equipment will focus partially on Armour Class, should be suitably difficult to hit. <br><br>The saving throws are most impressive a +11 bonus from Divine Grace and a +13 bonus from Champion of Torm, as well as +4 will, +2 fort, +1 ref from feats. <br><br>The character can memorise 2 level 1 paladin spells per day, both should be Bless Weapon, which make undead very easy to deal with. <br><br>The offense of the character is based on longsword specialisation and great cleave. <br><br>However, the real power of the character is in it's Divine feats. <br><br>It has 20 uses of Turn Undead per day. The Turn Undead power itself is actually very weak for this character, but the turn undead charges can be used for either:<br>Divine Might, +11 Divine Damage for 11 rounds. <br>Divine Shield, +11 Dodge AC for 11 rounds<br><br>Divine Damage is very rarely resisted by enemies, so it is very helpful for dealing with enemies that have large amounts of damage reduction. <br>Divine Shield offers a huge AC boost so will be a life saver when swamped by enemies. <br><br>The character also has a few limited per day abilities for use in major battles. <br><br>3 times per day the character can use Smite Evil: +11 to attack, +160 to Damage. This can be used to quickly take down major boss enemies. Evil dragons, demons and devils will know true fear when confronted by this character. <br><br>Once per day the character can use Divine Wrath, +9 to Attack, Damage and Saving Throws for 11 Rounds. This, when combined with Divine Might and Divine Shield will make the character and incredible combatant, able to quickly and safely destroy and overwhelmingly large force of enemies. <br><br>Once per day the character can use Lay on Hands, to channel 11 * 32 = 352 points of Positive energy. That can be used for healing (just as good as the Heal spell) or to attack an undead creature, which take damage from Positive energy. <br><br>This character is even more powerful when it has access to magical equipment. The number 1 focus is anything that boosts charisma. Every increase to the Charisma bonus increases:<br>Divine Grace saving throw bonus<br>Divine Might damage bonus and duration<br>Divine Shield AC bonus and duration<br>Smite Evil attack bonus<br>Divine Wrath duration<br>Lay on Hands magnitude<br>Turn Undead uses per day<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/26/08 07:39</span></i></p>
