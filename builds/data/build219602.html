Nicely refined.<br><br>Your ending AC should include the +8 from tumble <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   You're shorting yourself a little there, you've got AC 32 in mundane gear - the equal of most melees.<br><br>Something you might want to consider as a variant, if you are only going to use no-save spells, is to stop you charisma at 20 and put all your skill-ups into Con for additional hitpoints.

Why would you want low ac as a Gnome? Wouldn't IKD be a problem? You have acid sheath, and probably some other shields up but how effective is this set up if someone can KD you easily and just heal any damage while you are down, and repeat when you get up unless your server allows for timestop?

If I recall, you're 100% PvP and I have no experience with that.<br>Knockdown is a Discipline check and my endurance sorcs always multiclass to permit maximum Discipline skill (at level 38-40). If I am IKD'd as you suggest, well then if the attacker is healing himself while I'm prone, s/he's not damaging me. My damage shields stay active as well as DR spells (Premonition, etc) so they can flail at me while I'm down but still take damage.<br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br><i>I want my two dollars!</i>
