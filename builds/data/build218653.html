<b>Playable 1-40 in PvM.</b><br><br>This character's story is the story of the thread in the general forum  <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=456618&amp;forum=42&amp;sp=0" target="_blank">Melee Characters Including RDD</a>.  In this thread it was posited that a fighter 28/bard 2/RDD 10 wasn't any better than a fighter 28/sorc 2/RDD 10, and that a bard 26/fighter 4/RDD 10 was better than both.<br><br>To offer a counter example and to take on the challenge of making such a character that would give a bard-buffed build a run for his money, I made this guy.<br><br>There is another build with the same level split:  <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117531", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Dragon Warrior by Spooky222</a>.

You don't need particularly high-bonus permanent items if you can get a lot of expendables (scrolls and potions).<br><br>But even without particularly powerful magic items, like I said in an earlier post, with this sort of build you can run around with Power Attack or Expertise on almost all the time and still have the same AB, or even a better one, compared to many other melees.<br><br>With a successful Taunt, you can turn on Improved Expertise or Improved Power attack and still be able to hit a non-trivial foe. Or Taunt and use both normal Expertise and Power Attack at the same time. Being able to absorb -10 to your AB and still hit on less than a 20 against a non-trivial enemy is nothing to sneeze at.<br><br>Turn off special modes and you can use Improved Knockdown, Called Shots, or Improved Disarm with that AB too.<br><br>Add in tumble for extra AC and avoiding AOOs due to movement, around the same AC as a dex build, and DR 9/- and you're pretty darn tough as well. Your saves are low at base, but dwarves have +2 to spells, and you get +2 more from spellcraft. Still not stellar, but not completely useless either. And you can inflict up to 30% spell failure with taunt.<br><br>A sorcerer wouldn't have taunt, or tumble - or would have to crossclass them. That means 4 to 8 lower AC, vulnerability to movement AOOs, and much weaker taunt abiltiy. You also wouldn't have UMD. I think it's pretty conclusive that the 28 fighter/10 RDD/2 bard is a lot better off than one with 2 sorcerer.<br><br>And depending on the environment, it's likely you'd at least break even with a bard-heavy build.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 11/18/05 16:16</span></i></p>

You know, I think this build would be much more powerful with 14 or more levels of Bard. <br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br><br><br>(Nice build Xylo.)<br>_________________<br>What I'm reading now:<br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0874779405/103-5804382-8859066?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance" target="_blank">The White Spider</a> by Heinrich Harrer.
