Since Devastating Critical is back in business for Arcane Archer, here is my representation of the Arcane Archer who also is very formidable in melee as well. He is an Elvish Fighter 10/Wizard 1/Arcane Archer 29. Also, one of the lvl 1 wizard spell you want to learn is True Strike.<br>You will put the bonus STR ability points at 4-24 and DEX for the rest<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>STR - 16<br>DEX - 18<br>CON - 12<br>INT - 12<br>WIS - 8<br>CHA - 8<br><br>Ending Stats:<br>STR - 25<br>DEX - 26<br>CON - 12<br>INT - 12<br>WIS - 8<br>CHA - 8<br>Fortitude: 26<br>Reflex: 28<br>Will: 15<br><br>LVL/FEATS<br>1-F(1)Point Blank Shot, Toughness<br>2-F(2)Weapon Focus(Longbow)<br>3-F(3)Rapid Shot<br>4-F(4)Power Attack<br>5-F(5)<br>6-F(6)Cleave, Weapon Spec(Longbow)<br>7-W(1)<br>8-AA(1)<br>9-AA(2)Improved Crit(Longbow)<br>10-AA(3)<br>11-AA(4)<br>12-AA(5) Called Shot<br>13-AA(6)<br>14-AA(7)<br>15-AA(8) Blind Fight<br>16-AA(9)<br>17-AA(10)<br>18-F(7) Great Fortitude<br>19-F(8) Great Cleave<br>20-F(9)<br>21-AA(11) Great Strength I<br>22-AA(12)<br>23-AA(13)<br>24-AA(14) Great Strength II, Overwhelming Crit(Longbow)<br>25-AA(15)<br>26-AA(16)<br>27-AA(17) Great Strength III<br>28-AA(18) Devastating Crit(Longbow)<br>29-F(10) Epic Weapon Spec(Longbow)<br>30-AA(19) Armor Skin<br>31-AA(20)<br>32-AA(21)<br>33-AA(22)Epic Weapon Focus(Longbow), Great Dexerity I<br>34-AA(23)<br>35-AA(24)<br>36-AA(25) Great Dexerity II<br>37-AA(26) Great Dexerity III<br>38-AA(27)<br>39-AA(28) Great Dexerity IV<br>40-AA(29)<br><br>Final HP: 416<br>Attack Damage with normal longbow is:1d8+21<br>Attack bonus with True Strike and Rapid Shot: +73/+73/+68/+63/+58<br>This character is generally tough with the ability to wear heavy armor and also cast spells through scrolls<br>Imbue Arrow has a Final DC of 47.<br>Skills:<br>Hide: 40<br>Move Silently: 40<br>Spot: 40<br>Lore: 30<br>Tumble: 15<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 10/12/07 19:34</span></i></p>

I really liked the look of this build so I decided to test it out. Two things popped up.<br>1) In the character build process, you need to take Epic Weapon Focus before Epic Weapon Spec. This can be done by taking the last fighter level in this build a little later.<br>2) The other thing is that it doesn't appear that devastating critical actually works with the longbow. While testing this build, I must've had a dozen crits and none of them generated a devastating critical roll. (The monsters were not crit immune)<br><br>Can anyone confirm that Devastating Criticals still don't work with longbows?

I just did a little research.<br>It looks like devastating criticals for longbows is suppose to appear in the v1.63 patch.<br>When that happens, this will be an awesome build.
