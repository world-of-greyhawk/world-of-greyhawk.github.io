Shadow Dancer was taken for the obligatory tumble dumps as well as HIPS, darkvision, evasion and uncannny dodge in two levels.  I took two levels pre-epic to keep the base attacks at 3 and to get the class benefits early.  3rd level taken to max tumble.  You could achieve the same results trading 1 SD for cleric to get an addition level 9 spell.  You'd delay evasion, darkvision and uncanny dodge until late in the build but probably OK with a heavy armor guy.<br><br>I went with the typical trickery &amp; travel domains because they were actually domains for Oghma but they are obviously tailorable to fit any diety's domains.  Longsword was chosen for the same reason, though a weapon with a larger crit range would be desirable (rapier or scimitar maybe).<br><br>Advantages<br>1)  Unbuffed warrior level AB in a Divine Caster.<br>2)  Up to 3 attacks per round at max AB with Divine Power &amp; Haste.<br>3)  Can achieve an AC of 70 with mundane equipment.<br>4)  can cast 9th level divine spells.<br><br>Disadvantages<br>1)  Saves are fair but nothing to brag home about.<br>2)  Will struggle with SR characters &amp; creatures.<br>3)  Buff's are dispellable.<br>4)  Low HP's for a melee focused build.<br>_________________<br>In order to find his equal, an Irishman is forced to talk to<br>God.

Looks like a solid buffing meleer.  I'm not sure how useful HiPS would be with low dex and no sneak damage, so I'd consider dropping SD for Bard (better skillset), Rogue (gets Evasion like SD and also 2d6 sneak damage if you happen to catch someone flat-footed), or Monk (I'm sorry, but you'd get Evasion, Deflect Arrows, higher discipline, and a little speed).<br><br>Oh...if you're an enforcer for Oghma, where's your Knowledge domain?

Bard would be more in character for a disciple of Oghma and UMD would be more valuable to the build tha HIPS.  Loss of uncanny dodge isn't that bad as he doesn't depend upon dex for AC.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Oh...if you're an enforcer for Oghma, where's your Knowledge domain?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Knowledge is just one of his domains and this is his muscle. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br>_________________<br>Him?
