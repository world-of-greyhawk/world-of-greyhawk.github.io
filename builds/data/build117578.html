I like dwarves.<br>I like tough dwarves. I like axes.<br>I like dwarves with greataxes. Especially when they know how to use em.<br>I present my first version of a Battlerager. Let me introduce:<br>Joe-Jim Toughstone<br><br>I looked at how I could create my dwarf. His purpose is to have as many hitpoints as being superior with the greataxe can allow him. I would appreciate any advice on building him but I am not changing weapons unless they introduce a great maul with a patch, hehe.<br><br>Anyways, here's the story.<br><br>Starting ability points<br>Str: 16<br>Dex: 14<br>Con: 17<br>Int: 14<br>Wis: 8<br>Cha: 6<br><br>This is how I levelled him starting a module and typing<br>##DebugMode=1<br>##GiveLevel=40<br>(but you guys already knew that)<br>If there's a smarter way to level him I'd like to know. For now it's just getting on with it.<br><br>1: Barbarian; Weapon Focus Greataxe, 4 ranks in intimidate (for Weapon Master)<br>2: Fighter; Dodge<br>3: Fighter; Expertise, Mobility<br>4: Barbarian; +1 Con<br>5: Fighter;<br>6: Fighter; Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack<br>7: Weapon Master; Weapon of Choice Greataxe<br>8: Weapon Master; +1 Con<br>9: Weapon Master; Improved Critical Greataxe<br>10: Weapon Master;<br>11: Weapon Master;<br>12: Weapon Master; +1 Con, Power Attack<br>13: Weapon Master;<br>14: Barbarian;<br>15: Barbarian; Cleave<br>16: Barbarian; +1 Con<br>17: Barbarian;<br>18: Barbarian; Great Cleave<br>19: Barbarian;<br>20: Barbarian; +1 Str<br>21: Barbarian; Great Strenght I<br>22: Barbarian;<br>23: Barbarian;<br>24: Barbarian; Great Strenght II<br>25: Barbarian;<br>26: Barbarian;<br>27: Barbarian; Great Strenght III<br>28: Barbarian; +1 Str<br>29: Barbarian;<br>30: Barbarian; Great Constitution I<br>31: Barbarian;<br>32: Barbarian; +1 Str<br>33: Barbarian; Mighty Rage<br>34: Barbarian;<br>35: Barbarian; Overwhelming Critical<br>36: Barbarian; +1 Str, Great Strenght IV<br>37: Barbarian;<br>38: Barbarian;<br>39: Fighter; Weapon Specialization Greataxe<br>40: Figher; Devastating Critical<br><br>OK, this look slike kræpp but I don't much care atm. I just wanted to show the general idea I had and I just built him in the module now as I wrote this.<br>There would probably have to be 8, maybe 10, figther levels to get the feats I wish for. And he might not even need Weapon Master levels. It's not a big deal to me at least. The only reason to take Weapon Master is for the crit. I think I'll try a 30 barbarian/10 fighter and see how that goes. Start him off with his original stats:<br>Str: 17<br>Dex: 8<br>Con: 20<br>Int: 9 (he speaks almost properly)<br>Wis: 9<br>Cha: 6<br><br>Joe-Jim needs his Devastating Critical and Thundering Rage (with this lousy build I didn't even get that [chuckles]).<br>I'd also like for him to have 25 Str and 25 Con, though I'd prefer 26/26 but it's hard to get. I guess I could have started him off with 13 Dex and 13 Int but I wasn't thinking. When to boost the strenght and when to boost the constitution is also hard to choose.<br><br>I'd like to get the Dev. Crit as soon as can be, the Migthy and Thundering Rage can wait a bit longer.<br>Btw, the Mighty Rage and Greater Rage bonuses stack, but not if you do Greater Rage and then Mighty Rage. What's up with that? Should they stack at all?<br><br>In the end he'll be a Battlerager. He doesn't fear death. He believes as other Battleragers that when he die his god will return him to life even stronger. Go figure<br>With a 26 Con and raging he'll have over 1000 hitpoins I think, which is good since he really doesn't like to wear armor sometimes, ready to join the fray whenever [grins].<br><br>Anyways, I'd like some help with making the Battlerager using the classes available, not custom PrCs. So please help me out if you got a stroke of brilliance<br><br>JimDandy<br><br>Edited By -JimDandy on 03/09/04 13:39:10<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 11/18/09 20:41</span></i></p>

also, in 2004, there was no CEP, no PRC, no patches, nothing.  And there is too much wrong with this to make it worth talking about.  So if this was to mention a great maul, woo piee...  10,000,000,000 lashes with a death wet noodle to you before you can roll your next save vs waking the dead...  <br><br>Dam, this is before MY time!  and thats OOOOOOLLD  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted <b>06/23/04</b> 21:16 (GMT) -- Anuis<br><br>Suolucider, Blitz 04, <b>avado</b>, Quisition, Boourns, ... welcome to the guild!

Also, they did not introduce the great maul in any patch.<br><br>Regardless, even if they had, it would not be relevant.
