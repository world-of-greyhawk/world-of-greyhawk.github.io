I, being naturally strange, really hate those people who make those dragon builds with 1 monk level. In general I don't like multiclassing for monk just for the wisdom bonus to AC. But the druid and monk class seem so perfect for eachother, I had to try it.<br><br>Also, I have a very strong disliking of clerics. Along with red dragon disciples I feel that clerics are one of the most overpowering classes in the game. The so overpower their divine cousins, the druid, who needs A LOT MORE WORK to become powerful. So I decided to make a melee druid that is just as powerful and or better then a cleric.<br><br>When comparing this build to a cleric build, I find that this build is much more defensive then the cleric. With damage reduction, more hit points, and higher AC, this build screams defense, which is natural as druid builds usually are more defensive. But, my druids 1d6+25 damage pales in comparison with a clerics damage. Also, the remaining cleric spells are much more offensive then the druids. <br><br>To play this druid effectively, you buff up yourself and your animal companion, summon a creature, and charge into battle. You have healing spells which you can use, as well as some spells like storm of vengance, sunbeam/burst, and grease which, even though they have low DCs, can be useful in the right situation.<br><br>Roleplaying this druid is surprisingly easy. A monk with a quarterstaff is natural, and with animal empathy, lore, and healing spells you can play a reclusive, quiet, nice druidic man (or woman) who is helpful to a party in any way he can. See, lawful neutral actually fits this character!<br><br>Powergamers, there is enough strength for devastatic critical. Drop maximize spell and combat casting for power attack and cleave. Then maybe drop a druid level for an extra epic fighter level for overwhelming critcal and take dev crit at 39. I didn't take it because I really don't like the feat. Hate it with a passion.<br><br>Hopefully this build will persuade some people to play the druid class some more. It is a fun class, and it definetely is not all about summons and animal companions like many people think. This is what I would imagine a melee druid to look and be like. It has definete character and flavor that makes it unique. So next time when you level up, don't click on cleric. Be one with nature and talk to some animals instead!

There are two dragon builds in the epic builds... that's two with druid. There are no harper scout builds but you don't hear anyone complaining.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

I like this one a lot.  I like to design my characters after cool portraits.  I have this one of a female dwarf with a huge hammer (maul?) that looks like a druid (dress, leaves in hair, etc.)  ...I wonder, can this be modified with the Dwarven Defender class?

Well, when I made the character I gave him the name Allenon the Quiet, which is a lot more respectable then the name he has now!<br><br>Thanks! I'm glad people like it. As for the dwarven defender, I'm not a big fan of 'em. And as for the Harper Scout, I'll get on it!

Alanon (diff. spelling) is a support group for abused families of alchaholics. So to be named Allenon the Quiet kinda sounds like the toon got beaten a few too many times by his dad. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  This wasnt meant as a flame, just some trivia.
