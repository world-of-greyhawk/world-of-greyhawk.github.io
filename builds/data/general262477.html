I have played this game for a long time and everytime I think I have learned everything there is to know about the game, I encounter another problem. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif"> <br><br>Lets say you have the Epic Dodge feat and an AC of 80 and your enemy has an AB of 40/36/34/32.  Here is the issue, on the attack roll would your opponent roll 4 dice or just one?  If he does roll four dice lets say he gets a 20 on each roll <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> . would all of the attacks hit, the first attack hit only, the last 3 attacks hit only, or all of the attacks hit?  *kind of* put simply will only your first attack hit if you roll a 20 or does this apply to all attacks per round???  Sorry if this was poorly described x.D

Epic dodge automatically evades the first attack of each round, whether they roll a 1 or 20.  But it does nothing for the following attacks, so if they rolled a 20 on the next three, they'd hit you.<br><br>Edit:  And yes, he still rolls a d20 all four attacks, though the first one is essentially futile, as it will never hit <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By mantis3 on 01/05/07 05:19</span></i></p>

Here's another E-Dodge question:<br><br>A Monk with Epid Dodge also has Deflect Missile.  How is that handled?  The Deflect happens only once per round on the first missile.  Yet E-Dodge is also on the first attack.  Does that mean that the second arrow in the round has a chance to hit the monk?  Or does the second arrow get deflected (provided the save roll is made)?

Wait... you're positive it's the first attack that would have hit... not just the first attack of the round?<br><br>That'd make ED even better than I thought it was. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">
