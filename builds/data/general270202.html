Heya, I'm playing a 11 Fighter / 28 WM / 1 Bard in a +5 Enviroment server. See, the problem is, he uses a Katana, which I need to have <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  and Dev Crit is a problem on the server...I'm going to be adding to the problem by getting it myself <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Anyway, since I took Exotic, I miss out on a feat, and only have 2 Feat options left pre epic. <br><br>-Great Fort (To save against Dev), <br>-Toughness (40 hp), <br>-IE (+10 AC for fighting those high AB nasties), <br>-Blindfight (To fend off those dexers. TS can't be obtained -from items, but I'll probably have a caster with me.), <br>-Or Knockdown (For pushing mages in the mud.)?<br><br>Which two should I get? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">

I suppose I can live without knock down if I'm going to be deving things.

Blind Fight.<br><br>The next one depends on your server.  40 HP is nice, but if Dev Crit is everywhere, then it's not going to save your bacon.  <br><br>I'd go with Great Fortitude.  It protects from Dev Crit, AND Implode. Having lots of Fort is a life saver imho.<br><br>I'm surprised you didn't include SF Discipline in the list.

Yeah, I agree with the Great For thing...But, Imp Expertise might be a lifesaver too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">

i'd go with blind fight and improved expertise.<br>oh well but i take improved expertise with any melee build, so it might be just me. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By dust7 on 04/06/07 12:41</span></i></p>

I'd also drop 1 fighter level for 1 more Bard - gives you a second skill dump, unless it is a server where you start at level 40.<br><br>TM

Take Bard at level 17 or 18 for an early Tumble/UMD dump. Costs 1 final AB, but he's got plenty to spare. From 17 until the second Bard level it evens out since he can use the Bard Song to get +1 AB and +1 damage as well, not to mention the +4 AC and use of scroll, wands, etc. Will be much more playable from 17-37 that way.<br><br>Unless you are starting at level 40, of course.<br><br>TM
