I originally just took the Rogue levels for Tumble point dumps, but as I began to flesh it out and test it, I was pleasantly surprised at how fun this guy was.  By dumping points into UMD, Search, Disable Trap, Set Trap, and perhaps Open Lock; you can quickly make your way through a dungeon without any help.  Of course carrying all the loot will be a problem, but that's what Empowered Bull's Strength is for.<br><br>I tested him in the Novice to Epic mod and also in HoTU.  In Novice to Epic, I was able to melee the level 40 Fighter and level 40 Rogue without resting. Of course I cheated a bit by using Mestil's Acid Sheath for the fighter and Hold Person for the Rogue. It was cheap tactics, but hey, you're a Rogue too, there's no good reason to fight fair!  The biggest weakness was the low HP against all the Crits that the Fighter did.  Of course in the real world, he would have been wearing some Monk gear (Robes and Boots) which would have helped lessen the crits.<br><br>HoTU, which is generally pretty easy anyway, turned into a cakewalk. I didn't usually take much damage unless I wasn't paying attention.  Invisible doors pop up as I am running up to them, traps almost always light up before I get close to them.  Such a great synergy between the Elf class, the stats and the skills.<br><br>I chose the Enchantment line because Will saves seem to be the easiest to overcome. The basic thought is: disable your opponents and then cut them down with your blades. Watch out for mobs with immunities to Mind Affecting Spells.  Having a Neutral alignment will help a little.  When all else fails, fall back on Bigby and Isaacs spells.<br><br>Before anyone mentions it, yes, taking the first level as a Rogue would give you a plethora of skill points to distribute. For the sake of RP I left it as it was, as the build is primarily a Wizard that learns Rogue-ish skills.  But feel free to swap the first and fifth levels, it shouldn't affect the build in the long run.<br><br>_________________<br><br>Pros:<br>- Lots of fun tactics: spells, traps, melee.<br>- Good, even skill dumps. <br>- Great synergy between Rogue skills and wizard stats.<br>- Mow through the cannon fodder with your blades and save the big spells for the bosses.<br>- Handle traps and locks without a Pixie.<br>- Decent spell DC<br><br>Cons:<br>- Low saves.<br>- Low HP.<br>- No Discipline.<br>- Feat strapped; could use more Spell Foci in other schools (Necro)<br>- Buffing... buffing... buffing... buffing... buffing... buffing.... buffing.....<br>- Can be somewhat easily dispelled early on.<br>__________________<br><br>I should also mention that there are a few builds that have similar goals, but this one seemed different enough that I thought I'd post it.<br><br>Cheers.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 01/28/06 23:34</span></i></p>

It seemed that I had something written down wrong when I was going over it, but for the life of me I couldn't figure out where I had messed it up. For example, in the Novice to Epic Mod I didn't/couldn't take Hellball; I only wrote it down because it seemed that I had an empty feat slot.<br><br>grrrr... I'll have go back over this tonight and figure out where I screwed up.  Thanks for catching my mistake.

IIRC Epic Warding takes 34 Spellcraft, and Wizard does not gain bonus feats every five levels in epic. The last one is at level 20. In epic it's only at 23, 26, 29, etc...

OK, I figured out where I messed it up.  I accidently carried the bonus Wizard MetaMagic feats into epic levels (25, 30).  When I was building it in the leveler, I never noticed that I didn't take Epic Warding and thought it strange when I didn't take Hellball at the End. <br><br>That's what I get for building it on paper at lunch and going home to test it....<br><br>Anyway, here is the correct version. Please note that if you want to take Epic Warding you will end up with an odd Intelligence.  That doesn't bother me much as I usually buff my Intelligence to help with spell DC's and depending on how the roll goes, sometimes it comes out even and sometimes it doesn't. If it bothers you too much, just switch out a Great Int with an Epic Spell of choice, although Epic Warding is the only one I ever care to get.<br><br>Sorry for the mix-up...<br><br>Arcane Scoundrel (Wizard 32 / Rogue 8 ) <br>Playable 1-40, PvM<br><br>Elf<br>Any alignment (although Neutral would be preferable)<br><br>Str 12<br>Dex 18 (20)<br>Con 12<br>Int 16 (33)<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 8<br><br>1 - Wizard (1) - Toughness<br>2 - Wizard (2)<br>3 - Wizard (3) - Weapon Finesse<br>4 - Wizard (4) - DEX<br>5 - Rogue (1)<br>6 - Wizard (5) - Two-Weapon Fighting, Empower Spell*<br>7 - Rogue (2)<br>8 - Wizard (6) - DEX<br>9 - Wizard (7) - Ambidexterity<br>10 - Wizard (8)<br>11 - Wizard (9)<br>12 - Rogue (4) - Weapon Focus: Short Sword, INT<br>13 - Wizard (10) - Spell Focus: Enchantment*<br>14 - Wizard (11)<br>15 - Wizard (12) - Greater Spell Focus: Enchantment<br>16 - Wizard (13) - INT<br>17 - Rogue (4)<br>18 - Wizard (14) - Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>19 - Wizard (15) - Extend Spell*<br>20 - Wizard (16) - INT<br><br>21 - Wizard (17) - Great Intelligence I<br>22 - Rogue (5)<br>23 - Wizard (18)<br>24 - Wizard (19) - Epic Weapon Focus: Short Sword, INT<br>25 - Wizard (20) - Epic Spell Focus: Enchantment*<br>26 - Wizard (21)<br>27 - Rogue (6) - Great Intelligence II<br>28 - Wizard (22) - INT<br>29 - Wizard (23) - Great Intelligence III**<br>30 - Wizard (24) - Great Intelligence IV<br>31 - Wizard (25)<br>32 - Rogue (7) - INT<br>33 - Wizard (26) - Epic Warding, Great Intelligence V**<br>34 - Wizard (27)<br>35 - Wizard (28)<br>36 - Wizard (29) - Great Intelligence VI, Great Intelligence VII**, INT<br>37 - Rogue (8)<br>38 - Wizard (30)<br>39 - Wizard (31) - Great Intelligence VIII<br>40 - Wizard (32) - Great Intelligence IX**, INT<br><br>* = Wizard Bonus Feats<br>** = Wizard Bonus Epic Feats<br><br>Base AB 27 - (BAB 21 + Dex 5 + WF 1 + EWF 2 - Dual-Wield 2)<br>Buff AB 35 - (Base 27 + Empowered Cats Grace 3 + GMW 5)<br><br>Base AC 23 - (10 + Dex 5 + 8 Tumble)<br>Buff AC 39 - (Base 23 + Mage Armor 4 + Haste 4 + Shadow Shield 5 + Emp Cat's Grace 3)<br><br>Fortitude 17<br>Reflex 24<br>Will 20<br>(+8 versus spells)<br><br>Max HP - 256<br>with Empowered Endurance (+6 Con) - 376<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By dmuzzy on 01/05/06 12:48</span></i></p>

Your <b>BAB is 21</b>, instead of <i>Base AB</i> you should have written <i>AB</i>. When you indicate buffed AB just write <i>AB (buffed)</i>, for example.
