Battlecaster<br><br>Advantages: 9th lvl Arcane spells and 8th lvl Divine Spells.  Decent HP and AB.  Can get AB around 60 with buffs, and is capable of buffing every stat he has, including damage and AC.  <br><br>Can enchant his weapon and armor up to +5 and add either elemental or magic damage with Flame Weapon or Darkfire.  Ignores 40% arcane spell failure, so even with full plate he only suffers 5% spell failure.  <br><br>With the Practised Spellcaster feat he has an effective caster level of 24 with his Wizard, which means he should be able to overcome most SR.  Gets up to 5 attacks per round with Haste and Divine Power.  Additionally, he gets Dev. Crit., which makes him very dangerous in melee.<br><br>As if that weren't enough, he can cast Reciprocal damage spells on himself (Death Armor, Elemental Shield, Mestil's Acid Sheath), and heal himself to full multiple times after his opponents kill themselves beating on him.    <br><br>Wizard 15/Cleric 15/Spellsword 10<br>(Wizard 6/Cleric 8/Spellsword 6)<br><br>Race: Dwarf<br><br>Domains: Strength and Healing<br><br>Stats <br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 14 <br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 16 <br>Wis 15 <br>Cha 6<br><br>Ending <br><br>Str 25<br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 19<br>Wis 18<br>Cha 8<br><br><br>Feats<br><br>1  Martial Weapon Prof. <br>3  Power Attack<br>6  Cleave<br>9  Weapon Focus<br>12 Great Cleave<br>15 Improved Critical<br>18 Practiced Spellcaster: Wizard (or PC: Cleric)<br>21 Epic Weapon Focus<br>24 Great Str I<br>27 Great Str II<br>30 Great Str III<br>33 Great Str IV<br>36 Overwhelming Crit<br>39 Dev Crit<br><br>Wizard: Extend Spell, Great Int I + II <br><br>Skills<br><br>Concentration: 43<br>Discipline:    43<br>Healing:       41<br>Lore:          20<br>Search:        20<br>Spellcraft:    40<br>Tumble:        20<br><br>Total: 247 skill credits <br><br>AB: <br><br>25 base<br>+1 WF<br>+2 EWF<br>+7 Str<br>_______<br>35 AB w/ mundane weapon<br><br>AC:<br><br>10 base<br>-1 Dex<br>+4 Tumble<br>+8 Full Plate<br>________<br>21 AC w/ mundane armor<br><br><br>HP: 340 max unbuffed

Interesting build, never thought of combining a wizard and a cleric like that. Looks like it would be fun to play though. It also looks like his BAB ends up at 15 (3 from wizard, 6 from cleric, 6 from Spellsword). Why not go 4 Wiz/8 Cleric/8 Spellsword and get 16 BAB for a fourth attack a round?<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.nwnprc.com" target="_blank">Player Resource Consortium</a>

However, if you already have 4 attacks per round, your 4th attack will be made not at your full AB, but at -15.  Thus, I prefer to lose 1 AB on all attacks, so that I can effectively gain +15 AB on one attack.

A few changes:<br><br>1) Change the levels to Wizard 17/Cleric 15/Spellsword 8.  This gives you 1 more caster level, which gives you access to Epic spells.  You lose your last Ignore Armor feat, however, which means you now ignore only 35% ASF instead of 40%.  Thus, you might not want to wear heavy armor, but you could still do Chain Mail and a Buckler, or a Chain Shirt/Scale armor and a Large Shield without spell failure.  <br><br>2) Change the Strength domain to War.  This gives you access to Aura of Vitality, which is a great way to boost your stats.  With Aura of Vitality plus your regular stat buffs (Bull's Str, Endurance, Cat's Grace), you can get your stats up as much as +9.  If you were to drop the Practiced Spellcaster feat for Empower Spell, you could potentially boost them all the way to +12.  <br><br>3) Take weapon focus in Longsword.  This way you get a higher AB when you shift into Tenser's.  That, and there tend to be lots of good longswords in most mods.
