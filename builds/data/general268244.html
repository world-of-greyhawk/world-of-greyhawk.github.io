I know this might have been posted before, but I couldn't find it anywhere (might have overlooked a few threads, though, they come in quite significant numbers). <br><br>Just wanted to know if the Self Concealment series of feats actually applies VS spellcasting as well. <br>I'm somewhat certain I've seen this posted before in one of syrath's builds, but again I couldn't find that one either. <br><br>I know the 50% miss chance holds up as far as combat goes, but does Self Concealment I,II,III,IV, and V apply to getting targeted by a spellcaster too? That is, do they get 50% failure, as they would against a creature with improved invisibility?<br><br>-Caz

I'm pretty sure it applies vs touch attacks, including touch attack spells.  And in some add-ons, ranged touch spells.<br><br>But it won't make spells which are auto-hit (and most spells are) miss.  Ie, magic missiles won't miss.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
