At level 39, you can take Epic Skill Focus instead of Skill Focus. It sounds like you meant to put that but then your Spot skill would be 57, not 50.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By whirlin_merlin on 05/10/09 22:30</span></i></p>

WHAT!  This is a very weird build, and nothing as passable as the bard one. <br><br>1) the way you take levels means you mature VERY late and to that point, you have really nothing to rely on.<br><br>2) NOt taking level 9 spells means you wont have the one spell that is the most efficient in handling crowds (no its NOT implode!  Implode is for amateurs).<br><br>3) 16 cleric levels with NO extend means the duration is ridiculously short, and 18 wisdom means you have no slots to make up for low duration.  <br><br>4) twf route?  I know this is doable.  I did a twf cleric "TYPE" character one time (see PRC section of epic builders under one of my group postings).  With cleric spells, this is a very cool thing, but again, you mature late so how long will you use this?  My bet, not very long.  So, like i did in the past, the twf feats are really a waste as clerics WHEN USED PROPERLY dont need the offhand!  <br><br>lol i best change direction..<br><br>To make this build more useable, you really need the lv 9 cleric and more cleric lvs (23c 16r).  I would keep the twf feats but work in extend spell.  23 cleric isnt long enough for a dexer to take out stuff.  I would leave wisdom at 19.  <br><br>I know as of late, that people like these epic skill feats.  I dont see it.  Remember, you are high dex.  With hips and cleric you can do alot in very short order.  To my mind, gr dex or the like is much more powerful choices.  <br><br>I have family stuff, but i think you get the drift.  cleric/rog/sd has VERY good potential, just not in the way you put it here. at least not as my old eyes see it.  I think there is so much left on the table here, that COULD be...<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 11/27/07 23:01 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I agree with avado, Storm of Vengeance rocks, it stuns great, it can deal heavy damage over time, and Evasion doesn't work against it, you should try it in your strategy as well, too bad it's conjura</div></blockquote>

I advice some reply text! Man, defend yourself, don't let avado treat your build like dirt <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>I mean, sure he may have some good points and he may play a lot of clerics and he may know how to play one, but damn, you said nothing and just followed orders.<br><br>By the way, I dislike the fact that in your second build you took Ambidexterity and Two Weapon Fighting but no Improved Two Weapon Fighting. It's worth it once you've spent so much on that.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
