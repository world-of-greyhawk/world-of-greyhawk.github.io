sorry but exactly what is this build supposed to do that the exalted sorceress cannot do? u have 2 attacks per round, so no more melee capability, and 3 fewer caster levels? what is this build designed to excel at? if it's casting, there are a lot of excellent caster builds out there.<br><br>sorry mate, looks like a nice build and all, but I just don't understand what u want to do with it.<br><br>happy gaming <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

No, it's not as effective as the Exalted Sorceress, but it's a pretty decent build, I think. The reason it is less effective is because it's an evil build and the BG does not get the save bonus at the same level as Pally, so you must expend more levels on classes other than SOR.<br><br>You could also go Monk with this build instead of Rogue, but I wanted UMD as well, just for a change - and also because I'm not a fan of the Monk class anyway.<br>_________________<br>"Tis no man, 'tis a remorseless EATING machine..."

I told you I thought it was a nice build, but I just didn't understand why it got posted so soon after exalted sorceress was released as epic build... cuz that's maybe the best caster that one can make, so basically any variation of it isn't quite as strong as the original. you could have just gone out and said that it was an evil version that detested monks (*woot* *woot*).<br><br>and divine shield is really nice, making for a nifty AC with buffs, auto-still spell, tumble and impr expertise (although I don't think it should be usable while casting). but with that high AC, why do you need discipline? is anything likely to hit you anyways?<br><br>I have the same question regarding my F/R/W, if the AC is high enough, is discipline worth it?<br><br>why the 3 levels of rogue?

What I meant was that if you had 43 ranks in Tumble and your modifier brought it up to 45, the bonus to your AC from Tumble would still only be +8, not +9 because the game does not give you an AC bonus for every 5 ranks in Tumble if they come from anything other than base ranks. I'm quite certain this is the case, which is why you see so many builds that have Tumble stop at 40 ranks. So, just as another example for edification: even if you had 43 base ranks in Tumble and 14 DEX (+2 modifier) and Epic Skill Focus:Tumble, your modified Tumble skill is 55, but your AC bonus is still only +8, not +11.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Would it be best if you added more blackguard class?

Skill focus doesn't add to tumble AC bonus. Also I see a few thing this build can do that the exalted sorceress can't. Finally It is a good caster build. I like it. Nothing fancy, but does a good job of being a strong in all departmenst character. Deisel, just because people post a build they like, doesn't mean it has to have a specific purpuse.

Sorry but I had to add this, I have tested the tumble skill in battle and even if the roll was a 1 you still dont fail your saving throw as long as your skill point is over 14. This makes this skill (along with spellcraft) the best skill to take even if you have to cross class. If I am wrong please let me know.
