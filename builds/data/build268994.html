Hey.<br>First of all let's clarify that this build is feat starved.<br>You get all you need, but nothing more, and you get it late.<br>It is not really playable until epic levels; it's designed <br>for the high-end content of a medium magic server where AC is very important and all the bosses have true seeing.<br>But on the contrary to the epic dodge/SC5 dex builds this one still does some noticable damage without having to rely on sneak attacks which won't work on lots of enemies.<br><br>I decided to go dex-based, cause dexers achieve more AC than strenght-builds.. as i said, AC is really important.<br><br>Overall this build should be pretty good at soloing tough monsters or bosses (try it in a module for example).<br><br>Well you'll see this one is really total crap until level 30+, don't say i have not warned you! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>note: you can't really change the order in which levels or feats are taken, or else the build will be pretty much screwed up.

You have used 6 of your 7 epic feats with normal feats.  WHile i see what you are doing here, it is a waste because you loose out on 6 gr dexes or what have you.

Well, here's my critic:<br><br>When you make a build, in general you have to focus on a certain thing of the build, when you try to gain too many stuff like here, your build weakens a lot, because by gaining an increased multiplier, you sacrificed a lot of feats for WM, and kept sacrificing even more feats for ITWF with an Exotic Proficiency, plus the required levels of Bard for Lasting Inspiration, the wanted RDD (which is probably the only add-up that doesn't presents a truly sacrificing investment), and the fact that you're pumping DEX while RDD boosts STR.<br><br>So, in short, trying to do everything at the same time makes it ultimately weaker, everything works so-so, but when you focus on a given characteristic (say, one or two, not five) you can excel on it and that's what can make you truly powerful.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;naked AB: 49/44/39/34/29, 49/44 - 7 attacks per round</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Eh... you tested this? because... how the heck do you get that high AB with such a low DEX and BAB (not even having Epic Prowess, it shouldn't even reach 40), I suppose it's a fully buffed AB score (yeah, I guess that makes sense now), yet how do you get a mainhand fifth attack at +29?<br><br>Altogether it's not that bad, but I'd drop Weapon Master completely for Fighter to get a bunch of feats, I consider EWS and full epic feat selection will serve better than an exceeding critical range and multiplier (critical threat range will not work effectively on rolls of 10-20 unless you can hit the opponent on such rolls, only a roll of 20 counts as automatic hit, if you miss on, say, rolls of 10-12 having such a critical threat range is useless).

After the feat investment in opening WM you really should take more than 7 levels to make proper use of what it can give you. The trouble is in doing so will impact hugely on your Bardic capabilities (LI, Bard and Curse Song, Loss of an epic feat, etc.)<br><br>I echo others thoughts here regarding the dropping of WM in favour of A. N. Other class. <br><br>One other thing, as it is DEX based you may find a few problems as you do not have the Uncanny Dodge Feat (Barb, Assassin, SD and Rogue can all provide that).

You are required to list unbuffed AB and AC.

First of all, this is not a forum for server-specific builds. Secondly(and even in your world), this build could work okay if you go STR and drop dual-wielding altogether. I don't think your AC will be much lower with armour and shield, if any at all. Your AB will def be better and damage too, even though you forego 2 attacks. Go Bard 23(or 26)/RDD10 and fighter for the rest and we have a winner. But the fighter variants have all been done. <br><br>If you really, really want DEX and Dual-wield, well let's face it. WM ain't gonna cut it. Fighter will out perform it in each and every setting I can imagine.<br><br>In short:<br>Bard/WM/RDD go STR and no dual-wield. <br>If you want DEX and dual, well, Bard/RDD/fighter for sure.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Even if you go Bard/Fighter/RDD and make it Dex-based, you still don't have Uncanny Dodge... Something that's worth to consider IMO.
