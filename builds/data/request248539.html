Assasin has his "Death Attack" it is calculated as such:  <br><br>At 1st level, an Assassin may use a death attack, which functions similarly to a Sneak Attack in that if the target is not in combat they become victim to the death attack. The successful attack forces the target to make a Fortitude save or become paralyzed. Even if they succeed with the saving throw they still suffer +1d6 points of damage in addition to the normal damage the attack caused.<br><br>The paralysis saving throw difficulty class is 10 + Assassin Level + Intelligence modifier, and the duration is 1 turn for each Assassin level.<br><br>=======<br><br>Monks have a Stunning Fist attack:<br><br>The character can attempt a disabling strike with a -4 attack penalty and a -4 damage penalty. If successful, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the attacker’s level + the attacker’s Wisdom modifier) or be paralyzed for three rounds. This attack may be used 1×/day for every four levels of the character.<br><br>Use: Combat. Monks suffer no attack or damage penalties when using this feat and may use it 1×/day per level. Constructs and undead are immune to this attack, as are any creatures that are immune to critical hits. <br><br><br>===<br><br>Both of these attacks are fortitude saves vs paralysis.  Anything that is immune to paralysis will not be affected.<br><br>Palemaster lvl 7 get's Tough as Bones which makes them immune to paralysis.<br><br>(information in this post was obtained from the nwnwiki website)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 08/01/06 20:09</span></i></p>

Here are my personal dragon stunners: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "232049", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Thaxll'ssyllia V2</a> and <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "238749", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Stunning Claw</a> the second has a very high Stunning Fist DC of 57, 61 buffed.<br><br>Also, try using the <a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/search/builds.htm" target="_blank">searcher</a> whenever you need a build.<br><br>BTW, Red Dragon Disciple level 10 also makes you immune to paralisis.
