Guys, can you help me out with a nice pally/fighter, wm, dd? <br><br>Maybe something like this:<br>13 pally / fighter<br>7 wm<br>more wm? more fighter? more wm?<br>5 dd, so I wont get flanked/sneaked (or is that 6?)<br><br>Please make it dex based with rapier. Or maybe kama's? <br><br>I'd also like to know final ab and ac + hp.<br><br>Thanks a million!

Ok forgot something: it needs to have 22 lvls of wm. So maybe 22 wm, 13 fighter/pally and 5 dd? 5 dd is enough to not get flanked/sneaked?

Huh? I would never build a dex fighter without a few core feats. Uncanny Dodge so you can't be caught flatfooted and lose a large portion of your AC, Improved Evasion to make good use of that high reflex save, and the king pin Epic Dodge, cause it rocks.<br><br>Now your class selection can't get any of those, so I'd suggest you either replace DD with rogue or SD, or you build a strength fighter, which would be more appropriate for the chosen class combo.<br><br>Oh, and only monks use kamas. No reason why anyone else would use them.<br><br>Personally I don't do dwarves, so I won't proffer an actual build. Have you tried searching through the hundreds of builds already posted here?

Thanks for your reply. <br><br>I can get improved evasion from items. Also I can get higher saves from items. <br><br>If you take 6 levels of dd, you wont be flat footed (same as uncanny dodge) anymore, and you will be able to get sneaked. So going the dex-wm route will give you 5 attacks and high ac. <br><br>Epic dodge is not worth it in my opinion.
