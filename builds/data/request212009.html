for originality you could use ranger.  add in your favourite classes and keep your dex up to a decent amount.  exotic weapons, and you are set.<br>of course, there are a million ways to go about it.  you could take a buld based on another race and adapt it to suit your needs.  half-orcs are often not used in builds since they get two penalties and only one bonus.  but try adapting some pre-existing bulds, the results may surprise you.  post it if its interesting.<br><br>-c

You need 30 DEX for self-concealment, but a dire mace isn't a finesseable weapon.  Granted, 30 DEX will still be nice in terms of AC, but it will prevent you from pumping STR and thus prevent your AB from being as high.  Perhaps either making it with a finesseable weapon (like dual-wielding maces) or using 10 levels of RDD to boost your STR to help your AB and damage.<br><br>Steve

When you've spent 4 of the buy points you earned to overcome the Int/Cha penalty, you still have 2 more points to spend <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Eg.
