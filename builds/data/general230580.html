Well this is my attempt at a decent all around shifter for the pure classes thread. I didn't specialize in any one form or ability, but tried to find a median for them all through feat and skill selection. I chose elf as the race for more options on weapon selection during shifts.  <br><br>Low to medium magic PWs prefered.<br>PvM 1-40<br>Druid(10), Shifter(30), Elf<br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 8<br>WIS: 18 (32)<br>INT: 16<br>CHA: 8<br><br><br>01: Druid(1): Luck of Heros<br>02: Druid(2)<br>03: Druid(3): Alertness<br>04: Druid(4): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br>05: Druid(5)<br>06: Shifter(1): Expertise<br>07: Shifter(2)<br>08: Shifter(3): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br>09: Druid(6): Toughness<br>10: Druid(7)<br>11: Shifter(4)<br>12: Shifter(5): WIS+1, Blind Fight, (WIS=21)<br>13: Shifter(6)<br>14: Shifter(7)<br>15: Shifter(8): Improved Expertise<br>16: Shifter(9): WIS+1, (WIS=22)<br>17: Shifter(10)<br>18: Druid(8): Maximize Spell<br>19: Druid(9)<br>20: Druid(10): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br>21: Shifter(11): Undead Shape<br>22: Shifter(12)<br>23: Shifter(13): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=24)<br>24: Shifter(14): WIS+1, Outsider Shape, (WIS=25)<br>25: Shifter(15)<br>26: Shifter(16): Great Wisdom II, (WIS=26)<br>27: Shifter(17): Armor Skin<br>28: Shifter(18): WIS+1, (WIS=27)<br>29: Shifter(19): Construct Shape<br>30: Shifter(20): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=28)<br>31: Shifter(21)<br>32: Shifter(22): WIS+1, Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=30)<br>33: Shifter(23): Dragon Shape<br>34: Shifter(24)<br>35: Shifter(25): Epic Energy Resistance<br>36: Shifter(26): WIS+1, Epic Prowess, (WIS=31)<br>37: Shifter(27)<br>38: Shifter(28): Epic Energy Resistance<br>39: Shifter(29): Open Feat<br>40: Shifter(30): WIS+1, (WIS=32)<br><br>Hitpoints: 320<br>Skillpoints: 301<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 24/32/21<br>BAB: 24<br>AB (max, naked): 25 (melee), 25 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 16/24<br>Spell Casting: Druid(5)<br><br>Concentration 43(42), Disable Trap 17(20), Hide 38(38), Listen 40(55), Move Silently 21(21), Open Lock 10(10), Search 10(15), Spellcraft 22(25), Tumble 21(21)<br><br>Animal Empathy could be taken instead of raising DT, OL, and Search as high as they are.

Multiclass with monk on a high level, you will get tumble as class skill, Evasion, Cleave, AC for you WIS and +3 attacks per round, Monk is useful in several shifts, there are a few which wear weapons (although I don't remember specifics), but, for the least, dragon fights unarmed, but you won't be able to use flurry of blows and improved expertise at the same time...... anyway, it depends on which shifts you use I guess..... <br><br>Maybe empower spell instead of maximize spell... I suppose you only bluff yourself since level 5 druid spells are not so strong, you can get +7 STR from empowered Bull's strength while maximize gives only +5.<br><br>Why an open feat? if you're taking epic energy resistance take another, or change one for more WIS, although it's not needed......<br><br>I would take some more druid levels, the only thing you get for all those shifter levels are feats, and since you left an open feat it wouldn't be a critical problem to lose a feat or two and you gain more magic, but of course, it wouldn't be a "pure" shifter anymore.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/15/06 21:55</span></i></p>

As he pointed out this is based on a pure/ near-pure build, in this case Shifter 30 is the max, with Druid 10 being the base class max allowed also. Monk is of no use in this instance, if it is kept to those principles.

Thaxll'ssyllia thanks for the reply. I know taking some monk would help a shifter alot and that more druid levels would give more benifit to a shifter build. I appreciate your taking the time to write as others may not have been aware of those facts. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>I chose Maximize over Empower do to personal preference. I don't like the variable effect Empower has as you will not always get the most from it. Maximize is a guaranteed amount every time. This also plays into the Rakasha's form Ice Storm ability.<br><br>I left the last feat open to allow players to decide what they wanted. At such a high level, any number of feats are viable dependent upon personal style or the PW the build is played in. The other energy resistance feats were taken as the only useful bonus feats (in this build) that a shifter has access too. Of course another energy resistance feat would make sense to compliment the other two.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Zog-Varnoka on 02/16/06 01:56</span></i></p>

Maximized is not playing into your Rak Icestorm ability since you can't put a maximized Ice Storm into your toolbar with only 10 Druid levels.<br><br>I'd scratch the maximized since you have a limited amount of 5th level spells and would do better taking SR, Owl Insight and Death Ward.<br><br>Perhaps an Extended Spell feat would be better.<br><br>10 levels of Druid might be good enough, but having buff spells last longer might be best.<br><br>For the open feat... maybe "Improved Critical Unarmed Strick".<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 02/16/06 21:02</span></i></p>

Ah, thanks for catching that Max'ed Ice Storm bit. I'm so used to taking it I forgot completely about not having enough levels. <br><br>Griphhook, could you change it to Extend for me please. Thanks.
