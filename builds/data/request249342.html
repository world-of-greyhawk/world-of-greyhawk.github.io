heyas;<br><br>  i was playing a variant of grizzled dwarflord's Heart of Darkness, and having a lot of fun.  then i decided to monkey around (read: mess it up) and try to make something that might do a little more okay in pvp.  <br><br>  i came up with this, and thought it was pretty spiffy, but i'm not sure it is optimized properly on all those esoteric points that you guys understand and i have no clue on.  i added fighter to get in weapon specializations... and ended up needing 6 levels, and so grabbed some extra feats (dodge/mobility).<br><br>  compared to my last build (Barbarian 17/Assassin 23), it has better attacks, better base attack, better saves, and more damage bonii.  it has less damage reduction and death attack (3d6 less).  and the same ac.<br><br>   anyhow, if anybody could/would/wants to polish it up and change it around (i know you probably want human instead of half elf for the extra feat, and probably skip the exotic weapon -- those are specific to my character).... that'd be cool.<br>   or at least point out different levelling strategies to maximize it.  i know for one, that assassin level 13 bonus feat really sucks.  at that point, i ONLY qualify for GDex or Epic Reflexes. :/  i'd really love another I-Sneak.<br><br>so... on with the show!<br><br>Build: Barbarian 16/Fighter 6/Assassin 18<br><br>Race:  Half-Elf**<br>Alignment: Chaotic Evil<br><br>Stats:<br><br>Str	15 (26)<br>Dex	14	<br>Con	14	<br>Wis	 8<br>Int	16<br>Cha	 8<br><br><br>Leveling:<br><br>1 B1:	Exotic Weapon<br>2 B2:	<br>3 B3:	Weapon Focus: Bastard Sword<br>4 B4:	str+(16)<br>5 B5:	<br>6 B6:	KnockDown<br>7 B7:	<br>8 B8:	str+(17)<br>9 B9:	Toughness*<br>10 B10:	<br>11 B11:	<br>12 B12:	Improved Crit: Bastard Sword*, str+(18)<br>13 B13:	<br>--------------<br>Dsc/Lst/Intm: 19<br>H/MSh: 8<br>--------------<br>14 A1:	<br>15 A2:	Improved KD*<br>16 A3:	str+(19)<br>17 A4:	<br>-------------<br>Tmb/Spt:  20<br>H/MSh/UMD: 11<br>-------------<br>18 F1:	Blind Fight, Dodge<br>19 F2:	Mobility<br>20 F3:  str+(20)<br>=============<br>21 F4:	WeaponSpec, EpicWeapFoc<br>22 F5:	<br>23 F6:	EpicWeaponSpec<br>-------------<br>Dsc: 26<br>------------<br>24 A5:	Epic Prowess, str+(21)<br>25 A6:	<br>26 A7:	<br>27 A8:	GrtStrI(22)<br>28 A9:	str+(23)<br>29 A10:	<br>30 A11:	E-Will<br>31 A12:	<br>-----------<br>Tmb: 30<br>Intm/Lst/Spt: 34<br>H/MSh: 15*<br>------------<br>32 B14:	str+(24)<br>33 B15:	TerrRage<br>-----------<br>Dsc/Lst/Intm: 36<br>-----------<br>34 A13:	(GDexI/E-Ref***)<br>35 A14:	<br>36 A15:	ESF:Intm, str+(25)<br>37 A16:	<br>38 A17: <br>39 B16:	ThundRage<br>40 A18:	ISneakI, str+(26)<br>----------<br>Dsc: 42<br>Lst/Spt/Intm/Tmb: 43<br>UMD: 24(30?)<br>-----------<br><br>HP: 480 max<br>AC: 20<br>AB: 29<br><br>Saves:<br><br>Fort: 24<br>Refl: 21 (+4 vs traps)<br>Will: 19 (+4?)<br><br>Features:<br><br>Damage Red: 2<br>Death Attack: 9d6<br>Greater Rage: 5x<br>AC Bonii: +1 Dodge +4 Mobility<br>Attack Bonii: +1EProw +1WFoc +2EWFoc<br>Damage Bonii: +2WSpec +4EWSpec<br><br><br><br>*: these feats can be taken in any order, depending on which you need fastest.<br><br>**: use human (or half orc)?<br><br>***: this selection of assassin bonus feats sucks, but it's what i was stuck with :/<br><br>note:  i dont max the hide/moveSh, because i really dont sneak, per-se.  i use the paralysis, kd, flanking, etc to apply the death attacks.<br><br>thanks, guys!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By bloodsong on 08/09/06 12:40</span></i></p>

Assasin Epic bonus feat is at lvl 14&amp;18, not 13.<br><br>I think you should take a Fortitude improving feat rather than a Will one.

um...<br><br>   why?  my wisdom sucks, and i'm always afraid of being weak-willed.  ;)<br><br><br>  thanks for the tip on the assassin bonus feat placement!

Protection from alignement will protect you agianst some mind affecting spells.<br><br>A dev crit save is against your fortitude.  An implosion spell save is against your fort as well.<br><br>Since you are a melle build, you should try to protect yourself from a dev crit as much as you can.<br><br>Not getting hit is the first defence, the second is a fort save.
