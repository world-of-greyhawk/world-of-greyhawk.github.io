Another in the long line of FTR/Rogue/WM builds. Nothing unique in the class choices, but I didn't notice any that went for high CON in my searches through the builds.

More skill points with this build means a somewhat better skillset as well.<br><br>This guy can take a beating and keep on going. With the Rogue levels and UMD, he gets a nifty little 4d6 sneak dice and can use all sorts of restricted items. Even though his STR is low, he still has a pretty decent unbuffed AB.

However, UMD will provide various ways and means to cover that, as there seem to be a plethora of items and spells that cover Will. Damage output in non-crit situtaions will be a bit low due to that STR score, but that's the trade-off for the huge CON and HPs. I'm not sure the Discipline is even worth it, as it's rather low, but in a party with a decent Bard, it will be sufficient.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 07/26/06 23:09</span></i></p>

At first, I thought that this build seems quite similar to my blade of the reaper build (just because of the class split), but after looking at it, there is no resemblance at all (not good or bad, just there). <br><br>While the damage side is a <i>little</i> lacking, the nice AC, DR and hp (<b>812</b> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif"> !) more then make up for it. Also, I think that your Discipline of 57 is more then high enough. A very solid build over all, well done Cin! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Big Meph on 07/26/06 02:26</span></i></p>

Interesting, high HP with EDR, and not too shabby AC for a non-buffer melee. If you excuse my boldness, I have no idea why the hell someone would want 30 CON... (do <b>not</b> try to find one of <i>my</i> builds with 30 CON because there is one actually). Anyway, good HP again, good Fortitude (not sky high but good) he should be good fighting and all even with only 18 STR, as he can stand a lot of damage, sneak damage allows him to kill ok I guess, and thanks to WM, his AB is good anyway.<br><br>Odd but cool concept, nice build.

Pretty neat build.  Nice use of the WM AB boosts to ofset the low strength.  If I were playing it, I would probably stop increasing the constitution once I hit 22 and then pump strength.  But that wouldn't fit with the concept you were going for.  Interesting concept build.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Oh crap. Good question, Christian. I'll have to look at the build and re-adjust a couple things. Thanks for catching that. Don't know where I got that, but now that I look at it, I remember having to drop Imp KD for some reason.

No problem Christian, I'm glad you caught it. Oddly, the build was never anything but a Dwarf. I don't know what I was thinking when I wrote up the levelling. I guess it was from my preliminary planning, where I was going to take Rogue at level 2, which would push FTR2 to level 3 and give me two feats there. Looking at the character in the leveller, I don't know why I slipped it in there in the write-up. Anyhow, good catch.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...
