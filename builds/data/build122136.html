<b>Straight level 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>Quote: Posted 04/07/04 14:36:32 (GMT) by Herbie Shimmer<br><br>        Quote: Posted 04/07/04 09:46:47 (GMT) by bnarve<br><br>        Being quite a noob at this whole making the uberdude posting I made a ranger that I think might work, the only problem I have is where to put the different lvls.<br><br>        starting stats<br>        elf<br>        str12<br>        dex20<br>        con10<br>        wis12<br>        int10<br>        cha8<br><br>        I basically want to input 21 lvls of rngr 5 lvls of ftr and 14 rogue.<br><br>        For best ab I started with 20 lvls of rngr<br>        The problem is afterwards<br>        Where do you put in the rest of the lvls??<br><br>        I want to end up with the best combo of selfconceal and high dex using a shield and weaponfinesse.<br><br>        From the rogue youll end up with 7d6 sneak,<br>        ranger takes bane of enemies<br>        ftr takes the ftr thang weapon spec and epic weapon spec.<br><br>        Can you possibly end up with conceal of 50% without sacrificing to much on the dmg side??<br><br>        PLs help and WOW 7th tread im VERY impressed with the amount of posting on the ubercharacter subject.<br><br>        Help and thnx <br><br><br>    That's an interesting concept bnarve....one I'm going to look into. I would suggest changing the build's objectives though. IF (big if) he can end up getting Self-Concealment 5, I'd make him a dual-wielder. With a Dex that high you'll be using robes so you'll get the dual wielding feats free from your Ranger levels. With the fighter levels you might also be able to get Weapon Focus in the two different weapons he'd be using. I'm going to have a whirl at building this guy, but I'll use 6 levels of fighter and 13 of rogue. The extra rogue level doesn't really gain you anything and the 6th level of fighter nets a (possibly crucial) extra feat.<br><br>    I'll post it back here when I'm done.<br><br>    Edit: Hang on....he'll get a massive experience penalty for much of his levelling life. I'll consider using Shadowdancer or Assassin for Rogue, or using a halfling to minimise it at least.<br><br><br>Hey bnarve.....you got lucky and hit me on a day when I was very bored. So I made a decent attempt at your idea. It gets an exp. penalty from level 11 til forever, but if you're just levelling directly to 40 or if you play on a high-exp world you probably won't care.<br><br>Anyway here he is, the Bnarve Sneaky Rapier Specialist. I made him so you'd have the option of dual-wielding a rapier and kukri or picking up a shield for extra AC. He's good with a kukri, but not as good as he is with a rapier. And I'm sorry, but he only gets to Self Concealment 4. That's still good though.<br><br>Stats<br>Str 12<br>Dex 20<br>Con 8<br>Int 10<br>Wis 14<br>Cha 8<br>Obviously he boosts Dex every four levels.<br><br>I'm going to just write down what you should do at every level, it'll make it easier to read. The layout is:<br>Character Level - Class Level - Feat<br><br>1 - Ranger 1 - Exotic Weapon Proficiency<br>2 - Ranger 2<br>3 - Ranger 3 - Weapon Finesse<br>4 - Ranger 4<br>5 - Ranger 5<br>6 - Ranger 6 - Toughness<br>7 - Ranger 7<br>8 - Ranger 8<br>9 - Ranger 9 - Weapon Focus: Rapier<br>10 - Ranger 10<br>11 - Fighter 1 - Improved Critical: Rapier<br>12 - Ranger 11 - Weapon Focus: Kukri<br>13 - Rogue 1<br>14 - Rogue 2<br>15 - Rogue 3 - Improved Critical: Kukri<br>16 - Rogue 4<br>17 - Rogue 5<br>18 - Rogue 6 - Blind Fight<br>19 - Rogue 7<br>20 - Rogue 8<br>21 - Rogue 9 - Great Dexterity 1<br>22 - Rogue 10 - Improved Evasion<br>23 - Rogue 11<br>24 - Rogue 12 - Great Dexterity 2<br>25 - Fighter 2 - Epic Weapon Focus: Rapier<br>26 - Fighter 3<br>27 - Fighter 4 - Weapon Specialization: Rapier<br>28 - Ranger 12<br>29 - Rogue 13 - Self Concealment 1<br>30 - Ranger 13 - Self Concealment 2<br>31 - Ranger 14<br>32 - Ranger 15<br>33 - Ranger 16 - Self Concealment 3<br>34 - Ranger 17<br>35 - Ranger 18<br>36 - Ranger 19 - Self Concealment 4<br>37 - Fighter 5<br>38 - Ranger 20<br>39 - Ranger 21 - Bane of Enemies<br>40 - Fighter 6 - Epic Weapon Specialisation: Rapier<br><br>Feats like Blind Fight and Toughness can be changed for anything else you might without really affecting the build too much.<br><br>So he finishes Ranger 21 / Fighter 6 / Rogue 13. I chose crit- and sneak-immune creatures like undead, outsiders and constructs for Favoured Enemies so he can still do decent damage against baddies like that.<br><br>What do you think?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 07/07/05 23:53</span></i></p>

Couple of thoughts:<br>First, Epic Dodge does more to protect you than SCV. I would get that first - take Rogue 13 on a general feat level, and get both Defensive Roll and Epic Dodge.<br><br>Second, you are wasting feats to take both Kukri and Rapier. I would either just dual-wield shortswords or handaxes (saving 3 feats) or dual-wield the Kukris (saving 2 feats). With low str and base damage, you aren't getting that much from crits anyway. Since you have some sneak damage from Rogue, I would add KD to make better use of it - that will help you more than extended crit range.<br><br>Personally, I would completely drop the SCV - you are better off with ED and 2 more Dex instead. You have UMD, you can always cast Imp Invis from scrolls, or get a cloak of Displacement, etc. to get the 50% concealment.<br><br>TM<br> <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 04/11/04 18:57:49 (GMT) -- billb0<br><br><b>Straight level 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>Stats<br>Str 12<br>Dex 20<br>Con 8<br>Int 10<br>Wis 14<br>Cha 8<br>Obviously he boosts Dex every four levels.<br><br>I'm going to just write down what you should do at every level, it'll make it easier to read.

This is an old post, but since you discuss it: Who in the world has any use at all for a <b>Straight lvl 40, PvM build??????</b>.<br><br>Not something I can see as useful in almost any setting at all......<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>
