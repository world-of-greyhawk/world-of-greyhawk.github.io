Because of his CON of 8 he'll only have 304 HP. I'd be scared to play a melee fighter with that few HP. I'd drop 2 off his initial STR and take 14 CON. He'll lose 1 from his AB and damage but IMO it is worth it for 120HP.<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

I little constitution would go a long way with this build.  I know you can get some nice boots or amulets that boost Con, but for a monk those slots are perhaps better used for monk boots (which give AC and a +3 Dex i think) and amulets of wisdom (again for better AC).  Looks like a slight drop in AB might be worth it.  Also, I think that you get a -1 to AC from the wisdom negative (but I am not sure), which further proves the need for wisdom enhancing equipment.  Attribute balance is so hard with monk characters. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif"> <br><br>Also, in terms of strength based monks or those with WM levels, here are a few:<br><br>Blade Monk by Amzard<br>Spirit Warrior by Amzard<br>Monk/Fighter/WM by d3myz3 <br>Speedy Delivery by Deltutammatre<br>Street Fighting Monk V2.0 By juicyplasma<br>Spell-Resistant Paladin by K'orwyn<br>Hammer Fist by Nukenin<br><br>Something more to chew on: <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>Very interesting build though.

I would have stopped with monk at 20 and have taken more fighter or WM levels (either 7 WM and 1 F or 1 WM and 7 F).  You don't really get anything for being a monk post level 20.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

It isn't enough to affect a relatively pure caster (35+ caster levels), and against multiclassed builds a 30 will likely prove just as effective.  Really, it's only going to protect you from something like a harm from a fighter/cleric.  A fighter/mage will just cast timestop and beat the tar out of you anyway. Unless you have 56+ SR, which is going to affect the pure casters, it isn't really worth taking the extra monk levels just for SR.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
