<b>Playable from level 1 - 40  ..PvM Build</b><br><br>Here's a well rounded defender who can deal out some damage.<br><br>bard 6/rdd 8/defender 6 pre-epic<br><br>stats:<br>dwarf<br>str 14 +8 rdd +5 from lvls +3 great feat<br>dex 14<br>con 16 +2 rdd +3 from lvls<br>wis 8<br>int 14 +2 rdd<br>cha 12 +2 rdd + 2 from lvls<br><br>feats pre-epic: dodge, toughness, and whatever else. I personally went for, dodge, toughness, improved critical greatsword, curse song, extend spell, knockdown, improved knockdown. Or go for the whole dev critical line.<br><br>epic feats:<br>epic: defender 14/bard 16/rdd 10<br><br>damage reduction 1, damage reduction 2, great strength x3, 2 feats left over for whatever. I chose epic prowess, and sonic resistance 1. Optionally, drop the great strength feats for energy resistance stuff as well.<br><br>defender 14: damage reduction 3.<br><br>Alternatively, as a more of a support role you can take bard lvl to 20 for a little loss in damage reduction. Make sure to take the bard lvl 20 on an epic feat lvl to gain lasting inspiration.<br><br>Dirge spell has some weird DC calculations, making it extremely high, as well as useful for the bard as well.<br>_________________<br>I may not be able to get an erection, but at least I have enough balls not to hack.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 16:54</span></i></p>
