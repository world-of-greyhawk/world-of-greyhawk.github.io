The PW that I have regularly played for quite sometime has undergone some major changes in the last 6 months that have tilted the mod inexorably towards fighter/wm/rdd based characters.  As I love playing the mages, its been extremely difficult watching all of the major spells/summons get nerfed while at the same time watching monster immunities and Spell Resistances get jacked through the roof.  Now I am all for balance.  So I understand the need to potentially curtail certain mage spells.  What I do not agree with, however, is the over-balancing that has taken place - and the mod has no plans of changing the current state of affairs.<br><br>Anyhow, because of the changes, I am now looking for a new PW home.  <br><br>Can anyone please recommend a fairly-balanced PW to play on? I'd prefer it not to be just hack n slash.  I like to role-play and perform plot related quests as well.<br><br>Thanks in advance.

Or try here where a PW story based server, lots of roleplay and some of the more powerful powergaming class's have been restricted. Ie you have to roleplay your character traditional DnD style. <br><br>The Adventures Domain for Roleplay <br><br>server name Lands Of Valanthrar <br><br>its pretty kewl still not got any characters at lvl 40 yet <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

World of amon: <a href="http://www.worldofamon.com" target="_blank">www.worldofamon.com</a><br>There are two different sets of servers:<br>1) Also affectionately called the 'cluster' Amon1a; Amon1b; Amon1c are all three for 'freestyle' playing.  You can RP or powergame, the rules are very much towards being friendly to others. A shared player vault exists between these three servers; the same mod and version is installed on all three.<br><br>2) Amon2; and apparently a second (unconfirmed) server to go in soon.  This is exactly the same as Amon1a - Amon1c but is RP required; powergaming frowned very heavily on.  Usually ends up being a patch behind as it seems to be on Linux; though very stable.

Greetings all. Perhaps I can interest you in the PW I've been designing. I and a few others have been busy for the last year putting together a new PW set in the Forgotten Realms, more specifically the section known as the Lands of Intrigue (Amn and Tethyr).  We are getting ready to put up a demo/beta server sometime in May 2005.<br><br>Our game will be mostly role-play driven, with some hack and slash thrown in for fun.  The world will allow PvP, set to full, but PvP actions are STRONGLY encouraged to be only done so for purposes of the storyline (role-playing).  So far we have 3 DMs including myself, but as the project lead I’m not sure how much DM time I will get in.  If there is anybody out there who wants to try their hand at DMing, please contact me.  No experience is needed, only the drive to do a good job and learn.  The demo/beta phase will provide ample time for anybody to learn how to DM.  Of course, any experienced DMs out there are welcome to join as well.  There is plenty of space in the demo mod to run both DMed and scripted quests.<br><br>There is a background story that will be going on, but it is up to the individual player to decide if they wish to pay any attention to it.  We are attempting to create as true a “living” world as we can.  Things happen, some notice, others don’t, but always the main storyline will progress.  The plot has opportunities for those from all walks of life, be you good, bad or just plain ugly.  I won’t say much about it, but recently a huge army known as the Sythillisian Empire, made up of goblinoids, ogres, giants, etc. have captured Amn’s second largest (port) city of Murann.  After a devastating attempt to retake it, Amn find’s itself bare of a strong military.  Adventurers are needed, but will they fight to free Murann, join the Empire, or not care at all and go to some other section of the world?  That’s up to the player.  And that plotline is just a small part of the whole.<br><br>I hope to help drive this storyline along through the personal interactions of the players through parties and, perhaps more importantly, guilds.  I invite entire existing groups/guilds/clans/gangs of friends to come to our world and make their presence felt.  Your guild’s motto/ideals can be pretty much whatever you want it to be (except no crazy-psycho killer type characters).  Many of the guilds on the BioWare site are already dedicated to some idea or another.  Use your existing membership and hierarchy if you want, or create something entirely new.  All I ask is that if you want to be officially recognized as a “guild,” you give me a write-up about it, things like general philosophy, hierarchy, background, etc.  Each official guild will be given their own headquarters of some kind.  These will start of very small at first, but can grow as the prestige and number of members (and of course money invested) from each guild grows.  Guilds will be provided with general stuff available to all guilds – buddies, trainers, trade partners, basic equipment, etc. – but also each official guild will receive some things more unique to their “mission statement.”  Allying (and betraying) other guilds will be allowed and encouraged.<br><br>We have some outstanding custom content made by our scripting guru, a quite extraordinary scripter that goes by Ima Dufus.  The things he does continue to amaze me and I fully believe they will help you to immerse yourselves into our world.  But of course it takes Haks to make this all happen.  They’ll be made available when needed.<br><br>For a closer look as to what we have been up to, check out either our forums at <a href="http://xknightmarex.proboards23.com/" target="_blank">http://xknightmarex.proboards23.com/</a> or our website at <br><a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/%7Eu8800878/ccfr/." target="_blank">http://www.anu.edu.au/~u8800878/ccfr/.</a>  A section of our website specifically for players can be found here <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/%7Eu8800878/ccfr/Players/" target="_blank">http://www.anu.edu.au/~u8800878/ccfr/Players/</a> and contains all of our current “House Rules” and game alterations.  Feel free to join up to our forums site and introduce yourselves.<br><br>We look forward to seeing you.<br>_________________<br>Ferret Fact you never knew: <a href="http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/9060/page0blogentry12711.jpg" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

Athas Reborn in PW Action is based on the Darksun game world from AD&amp;D 2'd edition and has custom monsters, gear, and after the hak is released, custom races (yes, Thri Kreen too!) and tons of quests and areas. All the nerfs are tested before implimenting and the rules are such that any player can be accomidated. PvP exists, but under the strict aegis of roleplay, ie: consentual and in context. There is a steady community that stretches back into the pre-expansion days of Dave Trump's Darksun online full of talented builders, designers, scripters and gamemasters who make it a dangerous, exciting and unique place to play. This homepage has a screenshots, a timeline and a link to the forums.<br><a href="http://www.athasreborn.com/" target="_blank">http://www.athasreborn.com/</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Deltutammatre on 04/21/05 22:01</span></i></p>
