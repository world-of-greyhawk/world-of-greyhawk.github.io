Save the goofy name(what else can I call her?), she is quite an efficient killer.  So let me start by explaining my choices for classes and feats:<br><br>Monk at 20 - 4 important reasons here are A)evasion B)Wis bonus to AC C)+2 to all base saves D)tumble  Having this at 20 really adds to the survivablility of the build which is also enhanced by Epic Reflexes.<br><br>Rogue at 40 - This is here to A)max tumble B)skill dump.  This build generates quite a few skill points so I figured Rogue would be best to spend them all on.  I know you may think it's redundant with having a pixie for a familiar, but with such high int it really enhances some of the rogue skills.  Also, with buffs and items you can easily outperform what your pixie could do.  I'd suggest 39 levels of Pixie and then the beholder at 40.<br><br>Base AC + epic mage armor + Dex buffs + wis buffs = 53AC which is quite good.  Of course she will need it with the really low HPs.  She's a glass cannon of sorts.  However with the high int modifier she can attain combined with epic spell focus Evocation AND Necromancy, she can be quite devastating with her DC checks.  Combined with a caster check of 42+1d20 to beat SR, even a pure monk would have to worry about her.<br><br>I chose rogue skills but really, you can take whatever is useful for you.  We all know how different the PWs out there can be.  Have fun and play responsibly! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 09/24/05 20:49</span></i></p>

Interesting build. Looks like you thought it out quite well. Just a quick note on your saves vs spells: they're actually +10 vs spells (your modified Spellcraft ranks are used, not just the base). With that in mind, I'd suggest taking your Spellcraft to 42 ranks. That way your saves vs spells will be at +11.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Very nice indeed.  Would that apply to tumble as well?  Say 42 Tumble(45 modified) would give +9 to AC?

Loks god except Appraise. I'm sorry I didn't mention it before, but I overlooked it. A while back I read a thread about Appraise and the upshot of it was not to bother with more than around 30 in the skill. So, I'd advise dropping your investment to about 17 or 20 ranks (which will be 30 or so with your INT modifier).<br><br>Sorry I didn't catch that before. I'll dig up a link if you want to read it.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

also why rouge 40 and not the typical monk, and why wizard, and also why focus in evo,necro and not maximize the skills?<br>second what spell house did you choose or hopefully you choose general.

However, I can't sacrifice such spells as mass haste or protection from spells.  There are a lot of PWs out there and the beauty of these epic character build threads is people can look at any number of builds and either create them to the letter, or tailor them to their specific needs.<br><br>In my case, going Illusion would not be worth the extra spell slots.  The PW I play on is very group focused, which I love.  Even to the point where it is near impossible to level you character if you want to play alone.  It's medium magic, beefed up difficulty for party play, with 0 permanent haste items.  To go Illusion would remove said spells from my book, and if we did not have another source of haste, slow down our monster slaughter with more rests and longer fights.<br><br>In the case of a server where such items can be attained, then yes, going illusionist is a fine option indeed.<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
