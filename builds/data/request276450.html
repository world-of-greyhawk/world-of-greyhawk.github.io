Basically, Paladin gives you a better AB post epic levels (before 20). That means you'd want as many Paladin levels as possible before level 20. I'd say 12 or all 16 post epic, and the rest in monk (6 levels of 'monkies' will give you IKD, which is an excellent feat to have early on for leveling, though with that being said it's also excellent for lvl 40 melee builds).<br><br>A reason for not taking all the paladin levels post-epic would be to get Taunt skill dumps later on.<br><br>Actually since Paladin is not a "3/4 AB class" you could go with both 5/6/7/8 levels of monk + paladin post-epic (or stick with 4/16 which will lower you taunt skill) and the effect on AB would be the same as long as Assassin is not taken until after level 20.<br><br>I'm curious as to which stats you're going to max/min, could you perhaps post so here?<br><br>Cheers.<br><br>*Edit* Dex based, didn't see that in your post.<br><br>Well you need 3 feats (ITWF) for dual kamas. Assassin would definately help, but I'd really take SD over that (cost would be 2 more feats), since you aren't getting more than 2d6 in sneak attacks, the Shadowdancer feat, "Hide in plain sight" will be really nifty IMO.<br><br>But if you're sticking with those levels, well it can still make a pretty good outcome based on AC. Uncanny dodge is neccesary with high Dexterity, and both Barbarian/Rogue/SD/Assassin would achieve that with 4 levels, however the 2 first mentioned would give you an XP penalty. To avoid XP penalty for Monk/Paladin levels, you should go human (half-elf is just bleh anyway).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By CaZin0 on 06/16/07 07:42</span></i></p>

If you give us some idea other than the level distribution, so that we can match your needs better.<br><br>For instance, which stats do you want to focus on, and which feats are a must have in your case?

I would say it's a matter of perception.  Since epic is 21, anything after that theoretically <i>could</i> be considered post epic, even if it's epic in itself.<br><br>Back on topic, you are sure you want Assassin as your third class?  If you're looking for sneak damage, you aren't getting much - I'd suggest something like Fighter or Blackguard, to max out BAB.  And are you going to try for Divine Shield/Might?  <br><br>Perhaps tell us what you want your starting stats to be (i.e 13 STR or 8 ), and also why you want Assassin as your third class.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By mantis3 on 06/17/07 12:02</span></i></p>

The post-epic stuff can be discussed further of course, since rules do exist for 41-60 (which would then be "post-epic"). <br><br>It was just a little typo heh. Now let's get some advices together for this fellow.<br><br>If you're going Assassin for Uncanny Dodge, then I'd advise 4 levels of SD instead, HiPS &gt; 2d6 sneak. More over, you usually want HiPS for sneaks, but also to hide quickly if you're getting your *** wooped. <br>If you're not looking for Uncanny Dodge, then go Blackguard. You'd recieve double the bonus from charisma to saving throws, you could max out your pre-epic AB, and you'll get 1d6 sneak. Assassin would (worth mentioning) only give you 2d6 sneak and Uncanny Dodge, but if you don't need the latter, Blackguard is the way to go IMO.<br>Say your buffed charisma mod @ lvl 40 is 15, you'd give +15 to all saving throws from Divine Grace (paladin). With Blackguard's dark blessing you'd get another +15 to all saves. <br><br>Not sure if they cap at +20 like AC though?
