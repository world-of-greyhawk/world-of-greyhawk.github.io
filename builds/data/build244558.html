I have built me one of these lookalikes once, but I did Ranger21/SD3/16. But I have never had the luxury in me to see the use of SD except for HiPS and in this case Uncanny dodge, and a tumble dump. This obviously works though.<br><br>Glad to see more people who like rangers.<br><br>*edit* Hm, you take both spot and listne, and waste 2 points in Tumble and around 20+ on search and still you haven't got any of the rangers trap-skills?

Actually, the main reason I took SD here was because of what it gets at 5th and 10th levels. They get Defensive Roll at 5th and Improved Evasion at 10th, so taking your 10th level of Shadowdancer at level 39 not only lets you  somewhat max Tumble, but it also lets you take Epic Dodge. Oh, and thanks for the edit. ^^<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DragonRaider69 on 06/20/06 22:06</span></i></p>

I feel uncomfortable that this build doesn't have SCV, but I'm a die-hard SCV lover. This should work quite effectively, I can see myself having fun leveling something like it up.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

FYI, tumble works out of baseranks. Each 5 gives you +1 AC. So 40 gives you the max bonus of +8 AC.

i know you want to keep the maximum number of ranger levels, but boe and epic dodge come so late as to be almost pointless.  also all those feats for just 7 levels of wm is a little bit of a waste, imo.  while you do get a good bonus to a handaxe, other choices might be better/easier.<br>i would recommend using 6 levels of fighter instead, another level of sd, and picking up ews.  you can work in epic dodge much earlier, and even if boe comes much later you will have another +6 on each weapon.<br>in addition, you can pick up some other feats, strengthening your char in other ways (save-boosting, combat feats, etc.).<br>or pick up CoT instead of Fighter, to automatically boost saves at the expense of ews.<br>just my 2 cents.<br><br>-cs

I'm going to have to disagree with it being a waste...Unless you're going more than level 13 (And probably a lot more than that), 7 is basically all you need of it. A handaxe is a base x3 crit, right? Well, 5 levels sends that up to x4...So you have a hand-held scythe, more or less. You also have a 16-20/x4, assuming you have a keen Handaxe. As for fighter...Well, while EWS would be nice, you'd have to kill WM, and IMO you're getting more damage out of the WM than the EWS and such...As for getting Epic Dodge late...Well, yes, this is true. But this build is meant for the type of server where you CAN level fairly quickly. Would I reccomend this build for a Low Level RP server? Hell no. Would I reccomend it for that server you can get to level 40 fast? Yes. As for saves...Well, if you take all 37 points out of search, 2 points out of tumble, and 1 point out of spot (or listen, or whatever) you can cross-class Spellcraft up to 20(That's +4 saves against spells). If I'm right, the base bonus CoTs get to saves is +5, right? So, I think a little editing can get somewhat what you want.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DragonRaider69 on 06/21/06 02:27</span></i></p>

This build is somewhat like my <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "212705", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Baneblade</a> build, but I go the STR route.<br><br>I have to agree that the WM is somewhat of a waste due to the feat investment for really what amounts to very little gain. You get a better crit range, better multiplier, and +1 AB from the 7 WM levels, but you lose the opportunity to take other quite nice feats. FTR levels, while not giving you the crit goodies, will add +6 (if you take EWS) to your damage on every hit and provide room for other feats as well. Crits are only good for some of your strikes and useless against crit-immune mobs.<br><br>That's not to say it's a bad build - it isn't. But it <i>is</i> feat-starved due to the WM requirements.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 06/21/06 02:39</span></i></p>

Hmmm...If you really want, you can COMPLETELY replace Ranger and just go Fighter/WM/SD...However, I don't know that I personally would do that, as it takes out the fun part! (As you guys can tell, I really, really like Rangers. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> )

Oh yeah, Rangers are cool. I've just never been satisfied with a DEX-based Ranger, but they're certainly viable. Especially with Bane and some SD levels.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...
