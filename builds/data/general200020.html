I am looking for help with a casting build with at least 20 wiz/sorc lvls and the ac would have the help of items i already have on a persistant world that include +7 armor ac +7 natural ac +7 dodge and +7 deflection so thats 28 ac right there.. If the build has already been done, that's awesome just show me the way. Otherwise i'm looking for your ideas because i've been tinkering alot and just think i must be missing something... thanks so much in advance and I look foreward to your post!<br><br>Cheers,<br>_________________<br>gwen'eth moonthistle

your only real chance is sorc/rdd/pm (since you have the tumble already).  Usin imp expertise is 10.. so you have at least 48 ac.  The only thing you did was make it impossible for everything else (as far as i can tell).  Taking pm to 28 gives +16 ac.. so you have now 76 or so.  BUt that leaves 12 lvls left.  you need 3 sorc lvls to qual for rdd, leavin 9 for rdd..  so +3 ac..  79??  with armor skin you can get 81.  Using fp is 8, tower is 3,  that gives 92...  LOL  <br><br>BUT! the build ISNT what you askd for, so what you want is impossible, from what i can tell (unless you can find +10 itms).   <br><br>So, the question you have to ask yourself is, what is more important: ac or caster abilities?  Havin a lv 3 sorc with 100 ac may be nice, but im not sure what for!<br><br>peace
