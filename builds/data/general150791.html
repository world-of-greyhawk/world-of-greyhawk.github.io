If its for Aventia - have you taken into account levels 41 and up? They have added damage for higher levels, but there are issues with chars that take Bard/PM levels<br><br>&lt;Quote&gt;<br>"You need atleast 8 bard lvls to get the benefit of the after lvl 40 bonus and if you go PM too, you need atleast 12 lvls of PM."<br>&lt;/quote&gt;<br><br>I might be wrong tho - check out the article.<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "2143", "3417", "147609", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>For levels 1-40 Im sure its good. For levels after 40 you'll suck more and more. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">
