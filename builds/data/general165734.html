I was just wondering if the skill parry is of any use even if you max out the skill? By max out I mean take skill focus and epic skill focus and have your character be dexterity based since that's the modifier for that skill. You would have 56 + your dex modifier + 1d20 to beat the AB of the incoming blow. I think for a counter attack to occur the difference between the parry roll and the AB has to be 10 or greater.<br><br>Also it says that you can only parry as many attacks per round as your character has but does this apply to 2 handed fighting as well? So say my char only has 3 attacks per round but with 2 weapons he has 5, so does this mean I can still only parry 3 incoming attacks or does it raise to 5?

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">  Actually, right now you can only block 3 attacks in any given round. One of the buggs out there that hasn't been fixed.<br><br>I have never seen parry as worth placing points in.

That is stupid lol. Isn't it amazing how we have found all these bugs and even after the last patch they have yet to fix them all. Sheesh.<br><br>On a funny note, wouldn't it be interesting to see two melees in parry mode. Wouldn't they both just sit there? LOL.

Its not a bug actually. Its hard coded that way and meant to be otherwise a simple one level in a class that has this will make a melee build almost impossible to hit. Expertise /improved expertise should be used for the same effect instead. <br><br>Syrath

Parry is widely acknowledged as the most useless skill ever. It's not even as useful as Craft Armour, since that conceivably has a use,if you don't like the look of your armour, and it's a really, *really* powerful suit, and you have lots of gold. <br><br>Even in those limited circumstances, it's still more use than parry <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">
