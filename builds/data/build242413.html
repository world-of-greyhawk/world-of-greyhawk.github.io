Epic Prowess is lacking, which makes this NOT A HAPPY FUN-TIME BUILD. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br>Otherwise, nice.

I'm with Thax on the skill focus feats pre-epic I'm afraid. <br><br>Drop all three on Hide, Move Silent and Listen in favour of Knockdown, Improved Knockdown and Toughness. You then get a spare feat at 39th as well.<br><br>I'd also consider taking Fighter 5 and 6 at 22nd/ 23rd to get Epic Wpn Spec a whole lot earlier to improve your base damage output to everything rather than another favored enemy so early in the build.

I have to agree with previous posters for some emphasis...<br><br>Drop the non-epic skill feats.  Skill focuses and Stealthy.  Use them to get useful feats earlier in the build, like IKD.  This will make you a lot more playable and will have a very minor impact on your stealthyness.<br><br>Your hitpoints are critically low.  Most arcane casters will have more hp than you, and you have 21 levels of d10 hit dice.  You'll want at least a 12 con, if not a 14 con, and toughness.  As it is, if a maxed IGMS doesn't kill you in one shot, a stiff breeze will be enough to finish the job after.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Well my reasoning behind the 20% (meant 25% anyway) is that the detector rolls 1d20 + spot/listen skill vs. stealthed hide/ms. The 5 skill point increase translated vs. the 1d20 roll becomes 25% !!!<br><br>40 HP &amp; IKD will not matter one bit if the person you are trying to sneak can detect you.

Just a few things: regarding Stealthy, SF: Hide and Move Silently-- drop them.  I would only take those in a strength build with heavy rogue levels and enough fighter levels pre-epic to make it worth it.  As it stands, you are a dexing Halfling with Ranger spells and abilities.  That's all you need.  They have built in feats for that sort of thing.  Further, it may even be in your best interest to drop the ESFs as well.  Since there is no HiPS in the build, there is less of a demand for the "Hide me now!" feature.<br><br>Now, when I see a Halfling with a starting Dex of 20, I naturally assume that said Halfling will have Epic Dodge by Level 21, no?  And SC IV by Level 33.  I think I see ED coming in around 33rd level.  If you are taking it so late, why bother with a 20Dex?  You're just handicapping yourself.  I would move Dex to 18, and begin restructuring the build from there.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

You forget hide in your build, Thax. That aside, he can take all points from Discipline and put into UMD and whatever else he lacks if he drops ESF: Discipline. Because if he does, his discipline check is completely useless anyhow. Discipline for casters and dexers are useless unless you take ESF: discipline. Don't get blinded by the oh so powerful Exalted Sorceress.<br><br>It's an okay build at the end, but don't make me level it.<br><br>If you start with 18 DEX like many here says, and 10 STR and 12 CON, you might be able to reach lvl 20 this side of the Millenium. You don't take Epic dodge until lvl 33 anyway. Yeah, I'm repeating the others. Oh, and assuming you will boost STR to max is not likely. You would want to boost DEX instead, and rarely will you find a setting that gives you the possibility of having both maxed DEX and STR.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

More hp just means it takes longer to die.<br>And not that much longer also, 170 more hp is equivalent to two sneak crits. <br><br>Oh and extend spell is a nono. The only value in it is for bladethirst. All other spells have significant duration (camos, OWTL, aid etc) or are level 4 e.g. freedom and cant be extended.<br>Oh yes, and as Grimnir has pointed out, hide is a tad low.<br><br><br><br><b>To answer some general criticisms:</b><ul><br><li> Drop ESKF Disc. <br>Find me a melee build on this forum that cannot KD 42 Disc. Either you play on a world with KD immunity items, in which case dont bother getting any, or you get Disc and you get it as high as possible.<br>KD, Disarm, Called Shot are all based on Disc, you cannot ignore it if you are fighting intelligent creatures that use these.<br></li><li> Drop XXX stealth. <br>I'm struggling to find the part where I said this was a melee build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      <br>This is a sneaker build. It's not going to be of use to anyone if Jack cleric with 36 wisdom and an eskf listen can see you and has remembered a few implode spells today. Anyone who wants to detect it has to gimp also. And gimp <i>alot</i>.<br></li><li> Get HP. <br>I play this build a significant amount, and I do it with only a +2 con item. If you feel you need more hp for your environment, go ahead and change it.<br></li><li> Hell levelling.<br>You got me there. I posted late and forgot to switch things around to make it early levelling friendly.<br>Ofc you're going to take fighter levels earlier for better ab and use of your favoured weapon the kukri, and yes Grizz, take rogue levels earlier to get ED sooner.<br>Fair cop on that one.</li></ul><br><br><br><b>The overall problem here,</b> is that we all play on different worlds, and as such are all trying to apply each PW's logic to the build. Take I...Samphus's post and look at the skills. Why has he taken UMD 15, Lore 1? Junk disable? Where I play those amounts would be considered wasted skills as the lore is useless, the UMD is floating in no-man's land and the junk disable couldn't remove a minor frost trap. <br>Yet where he plays those are probably the most efficient use of skill points.<br><br><br>Simply put, regard it as a template for a build that maxes stealth and does -high- damage on sneak attacks. Survivability comes from epic dodge and running away to stealth again, using heal to cover any lucky hits taken. HP is an afterthought.<br><br><br><br>In conclusion, I can only quote someone who has already posted:<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/01/06 10:27:47 (GMT) -- krsboss<br>40 HP &amp; IKD will not matter one bit if the person you are trying to sneak can detect you.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->/signed<br><br><br><br><i>edit: And Kail or Grip is going to catch me on the "what is it for" part, sigh ^^.<br>If you hadn't guessed it's Pvp focussed, 1-40 if you switch those feats around to take WF: kukri etc earlier</i><br>_________________<br><i>Some Forum Members believe respect is a right and should be freely given.<br>Myself: I work on a point-buy system, and today my friend you're all out of credit...<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"></i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By pocketbeetle on 06/01/06 18:21</span></i></p>

So basically what you are saying, is that your build's viability in PvP is contingent on having a corner to hide around every time you get into a fight, and hoping that you can break off from combat and make it around said corner before your opponent can react?  It seems like if you make a mistake with that tactic, you're gonna get creamed because you don't have the hitpoints to withstand a good offensive character's punch.<br><br>Or to put it simply - you can only win with this build if the enemy doesn't get to fight back?  I think most builds can win if the enemy doesn't fight back, but I doubt many enemies are going to be that obliging.  <br><br>Other people will have haste and be able to keep up with your running so that you can't get out of their sight long enough to hide, for example (and fear the monks!).  There are many abilities that can keep you from moving, or moving as quickly (such as bigby's, knockdown, called shot leg, even the lowly grease and entangle).  And the world simply isn't made of corners.  <br><br>To put it on a bumper sticker, an intelligent, experienced PvPer won't fall for this trick.  Would you?<br><br>Getting your hitpoints up over 350, or better yet 400, gives you a chance at survival and escape, or even at victory in a toe-to-toe, when the perfect conditions for your "hit and run around a corner" tactics aren't met.<br><br>On the True Seeing issue - if it's a +20 spot check nerfed version, spending 3 feats for +5 to your stealth skills is still pretty wasteful.  <br><br>You've got 68 hide with your build, +24 from spells, and +6 from max-buffed dex for a total of 98 hide.  An arcane caster with ESF Spot will have 53 spot, +20 true seeing, +10 clairaudience/clairvoyance for a total of 83.  So far it looks good because you have a 75% chance of sneaking up on him.  Without your preepic stealth feats he'd have a 50-50 chance of spotting you.  But if he buffs his wisdom, say because he's tired of getting snuck up on, you'll go down from 75% chance of sneaking up on him, to having a 45% chance of sneaking up on him.  <br><br>So you're spending 3 feats for less than a 50/50 chance of sneaking up on an arcane caster who doesn't want to be snuck up on.<br><br>A wis-pumped divine caster with ESF spot and true seeing will have enough spot to see you every single time however, since we can also assume they'll have max-buffed their wisdom.<br><br>And a bard with ESF Listen, Amplify (+20 buff), and clairaudience/clairvoyance will have very high chances of spotting you too, because you get a +5 listen bonus just for standing still.<br><br>Therefore you're spending 3 feats and not getting a heck of a lot of benefit, from what I can tell.  People who don't have a +20 counter-stealth buff won't be able to detect you even if you didn't have the +5 you get from those 3 feats.  People who do have a +20 counter-stealth buff will have a good-to-excellent chance of detecting you even with the +5 you get from those feats.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

well i just read "are you saying snealers dont need ab ?"<br><br>Hell if they have the choice between more stealh skillz or 1ab , go with the stealth , youre ab suxs anyway and you wont hit anyone 1on1 , the point of snealers is to hit out of stealth. flatfooted means you loose loads of ac so boosting stealth is more important. <br><br>The build is good and can be nasty only drawback imo is that monks can outrun you and being that slow while sneaking can be annoying to play since you have to camp spots instead of hunting peeps ( take 9 monk only 16 rogue and u get some speed and ac when dauling , tho yoou loose feats but still get all the hide feats) <br><br>vs mages : dont forget icestorms on the area you were hiding in or wail<br><br>Still its a good build with maxed hide /ms and if you play smart ,stay hidden most time and just strike to kill someone you ll do great .

one question Xylophone ...Trueseeing gives +20 spot? lol maybe in your environment.and dont forget about skill points of items which you can get everywhere, thats when the mage has no chance anymore.(i just say hardskill cap at 50, dex adds to hide which this char got plenty , wis a sorc has none ). What has a chance to spot this build is a zen cleric with doamin knowledge.Still with Reliables build you can hit the max hide /ms leaving someone with max spot to a 50/50 chance. <br><br>you think you hit with a melee char? well yeah but epic dodge saves and then you run , besides you strike from the back , mostly when your victim is fighting someone else and now he can try to target you when you run while whoever fights him gets +2ab cuz of flanking. <br><br>this builds owns melees andyou always can use a sling if you dont want to get that close cuz your vicitm is tooo dangerous.<br><br>dont know if pocketbeetle said any of this already, iff so ignore that <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>byez
