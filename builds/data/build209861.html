I havent seen this build crop up yet, dunno if it may be further back or if it's actually new.  Either way i dont have a name for it yet.<br><br>Classes: Ranger 20, Monk 1, Blackguard 19<br><br>Skills to concentrate on: concentration, discipline, hide, intimidate, move silently<br><br>Starting stats<br>str: 16<br>dex: 10<br>Con: 14<br>Int: 10<br>Wis 14<br>Char: 10<br><br>All ability points gained from levels go to strength.<br><br>I originally made this to be a versatile stealth build that can hold up to a frontline confrontation as well.<br><br>Feats:  Variable, i opted to make use of the Rangers dual wield ability and am using a Uthgardt Ceremonial Two Bladed Sword.  Cleave is a requirement for Blackguard, but the one level of monk gives you that for free.  This build wasnt made to center on any specific weapons or style of combat, it's the versatility that counts.  Toughness is a part of any good build, skill focus and stealthy help with the sneaky part too, helps to make better use of the Blackguard Sneak Attack.<br><br>Weapon:  your choice, but i do recommend making use of the dual wield ability, this build doesnt use armor.<br><br>Armor:  Any monk robes that grant a nice AC bonus<br>Rings: RoP as high as you can find, Ring of Elemental Resistance is optimal, the Resist all 15 is a good combination with Evasion.  I'm currently keeping with Robes of the Dark Moon for the haste ability.<br><br>Amulet:  Amulet of Nat Armor as high as you can get or if OC, fully upgraded Amulet of the Long Death (grimgnaws amulet)<br><br>Boots:  Boots of the Sun and Soul as high as you can get.<br><br>Cloak:  Optional, whatever you feel you can use best to go with your build.<br><br>Belt:  Belt of Agility as high as you can find, without actual armor dex makes for higher AC and better saves.<br><br>Bracers/Gauntlets:  Since i dont go unarmed i've opted for Bracers of Armor, if you get robes with an Armor Bonus i'd go Gaunts of Ogre Power.<br><br>The sneak attack from Blackguard might not seem like much extra damage, but considering that this build isnt a total power focused build, it helps to even out the damage ratio.  Even though you cant sneak attack some things, it's still viable IMO.<br><br>Any suggestions?  I've remade the build to fine tune it better following the same two bladed sword progression, just altering my feat choices some and i'm at 15th level (Ranger 7, Monk 1, Blackguard 7).<br><br>Mayhem<br><br>EDIT:  Forgot Favored Enemy stuff.  Since i'm pretty much stuck in SP mode due to a slow dial up connection, i tend to choose my Favored Enemies based on the toughest monsters in the game, Dragons and playable races.  On a PW or something your choices may be different due to what your goal is.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By MayhemST on 08/24/05 04:24</span></i></p>

MayhemST,<br><br>You should post the entire build here in this forum, like all the other posts. Without it, we can't properly critique (or replicate) your character. If you're just floating a build idea for discussion, then you should repost in the General Discussion area of the Epic Builds Guild.<br><br>As for "I havent seen this build crop up yet, dunno if it may be further back or if it's actually new." you could use Pulse Cap's magical Character Search Engine to look: <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=445068&amp;forum=42" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br><i>"Where there is life, there is hope." - Grover</i>

And, any other suggestions you all can think of to maybe fine tune this into a better build?<br><br>Mayhem

it's a pity to take so many ranger lvls and not take bane of enemy...And i guess between the low dex and the average wis, the ac must be pretty low...This character seems to hit hard, but I doubt he would hit for long...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Anglashell on 08/26/05 06:52</span></i></p>

Forgot to add; concerning the lvl distribution, I would go for ranger21/monk3/bg16.<br>You would loose 1d6 sneak and a bonus feat, but gain Bane of enemies (+2d6 dmg), monk speed, and +8 in ac from tumble.<br><br>To be totally honnest, i wonder if it wouldnt be better to wear a leather armor and go for rogue or assassin instead of monk...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Anglashell on 08/26/05 09:18</span></i></p>

I agree with Anglashell<br>I think Ranger 21/Rogue 3/BG 16 would be best<br>Loses an Epic Feat but gains Bane of Enemies, Uncanny Dodge, Evasion and 1d6 Sneak overall<br>Could take UMD and use Monk items if desired<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

I'd also change the FE selection to cover crit/sneak immune creatures. Humans, elves, etc. will get already pounded by your sneaks<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

I have to agree with what a lot of other people are saying... ranger/rogue/BG with bane of enemies would work out a lot better.<br><br>You probably would also benefit from trying a dex build or partial dex build to get your AC up and give you a ranged sneak attack option.  You can use your epic vrock to tank while you fire ranged sneak attacks, for example.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

I'd prefer taking Epic Fiend (I love that Vrock... tough little bugger)... nice build though... I'd agree going the rogue route... get some more sneak and more skill points. Try that.
