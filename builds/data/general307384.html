Nervous? nervous!? WHY!? What's the worse thing that can happen? the first build I posted, naive as I thought it was so awesome just because I played one or two modules with it and it owned, first reply Grim said it was crap, my AC was ridiculously low, I didn't notice, but who cares? I actually got the best suggestions on my early builds, when I made lots of more mistakes and used to make less considerations. There is no reason to be nervous, it's good to get criticism, at least that's how I see it.<br><br>Taking a different weapon is no build difference because you only switch one feat that was already taken.

Ah, well, another thing. When we criticize builds, we only see the build design, so we can't make suggestions given a specific server, builds get compared and improved numerically, plain generalities: how they would work alone or in a party if they play in an empty room, equipped with non-magical trash against all types of enemies. So when it comes down to making a build targeted for a specific boss or PW, it's very hard to give good suggestions, the environment makes can bias your build design.<br><br>Say, you're talking about some enemy with such high slashing immunity, heck I've never fought one of those, or if I did I was using blunt and never knew, since I use blunt weapons most often. Sometimes I get owned for not paying attention to this stuff, anyway, I always try to have more than one damage type (blunt and spells mostly). Given that, when I criticize a build, I never think "what would happen if this build were to fight a 70% slash immune enemy", that thought is never in my mind.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

It sounds to me that Sword Dog is already an epic builder!  It is so impressive sword, that you consider stuff like damage type!  Im like Thax!  I build on a server for what weapons I have available to me, and what i like at the time.  It has been rare that i went before hand to consider such things!  Bravo!<br><br>Maybe, and it may be difficult to find, but you should look at the PRC rules.  THey have a prc class, Man at Arms, where you require wepon foci in 3 or 4 different weapons to qualify.  That would allow you to have all 3 damage types specialized in!  Oh well.

Thax and avado, Im an old fashioned hack n slasher from a long ways back.The lotr of the rings servers gave me the "kill fix" i was always longing for.<br><br>And since the lotr servers 4 to 8 had always been high magic, high exp, high kill rate worlds, I based and tried many ideas on it.<br><br>Why you may ask ? If a build preforms well on a high end world, it would likely go near pure pawnage on a medium or low end worlds.<br><br>With or without magical items.<br><br>As to a specific monster style monster killer, people can generally level to forty realistically in about 4 hours on a high end magic world.<br><br>But in a few server's, the mini bosses/main bosses and elite troops have been found to carry immunities and huge regeneration......besides the effects of hitting like a truck against a wall of candy floss.<br><br>The candy floss (player) gets killed in one hit, unless they have access to the "elite" immunity items and end up "amoured" the same as the scum theyre trying to kill.<br><br>One evil wizard in mind is the truck and ive been many times the candy floss squished under his assault.<br><br>Until i realised he wasnt that heavily bludge immune and basically zero immune to peirce damage. An AA could blast off maybe 3 or 4 slay evil arrows and massacre the wizard.<br><br>But meelee toons get it abit tougher.<br><br>As to what weapon im using, i'll tell you guys later.<br>Its not hacked or whatever....but its "customised" and lets leave it there.<br><br>(Edit)Fancy items or not, 600 life and decent saves/AC naturally is what im wanting.A build that can "take the pain"<br>_________________<br>Surviving 3 cats, 2 kids and a wife deserves some serious game time, dont cha think ?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By SwordDog on 03/20/09 00:25</span></i></p>

The type of build that owns on low to mid magical servers are usually those that have plenty of self-buffs and rely less on weapons, but many of those buffs can go to waste on high magical environments, so you could be able to beat a Cleric if you're on a +15 server, but the same build would trash you on +3. For example, I'm a big time Druid player, and I've destroyed hell in some low magical servers, both PvP and PvM, bring your best build, a dragon's AC is nearly untouchable in a +2 environment, but I would get a very hard time in a +10 or higher environment, where my AB starts to suck, as weapons are ompletely useless to my shifting style. Not that I'm done on a high environemnt, but it would lessen power in comparison.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Generally if it has self buffs or UMD for scroll buffs it's suited for a low-mid end server.<br><br>Classes with no access to self buffing generally tend to be either party orientated for external buffs or suited for a high end world.<br><br>If you want examples; Clerics, Druids, Sorcerers, Bards and Wizards in general are low-mid magic gods, Builds with adequate levels in one of those classes are great for +5/+6 worlds so not too much to worry about when using them on high/low magic settings.<br><br>Also as for high magic servers strength builds can generally be transferred to low magic servers without too much trouble or too many changes.<br><br>Dex builds however aren't as easy since they'll lose out on the massive +dmgs on weapons that are usually found on high magic servers so you're left with a high AC low dmg build.<br><br>Either way though, it should be possible to tweak any high magic build down to work for whatever setting you want..It might just be a different build when you're done <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>BTW If you have Microsoft Office, Take a look at this <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.Detail&amp;id=856" target="_blank">Click Here</a> Less typing and a simple copy/paste to put it up here<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Revenant Mattlov on 03/21/09 00:56</span></i></p>

Keen doesn't increase the multiplier it just decreases the threat range (19-20 = 17-20, 18-20 = 15-20 etc)<br><br>I'm fairly certain Massive Crits are physical. As a note, it does stack with overwhelming critical but it overrides  Barbarians Thundering Rage feat.

Sord, you really dont need all that math kaka!!  For the build, it is really only necessary to put ab with threat range, ac, hp.   The rest is just, what Thax and i have hinted at, fluff.  People try to hide more with alot of numbers and stuff to make it sound more impressive.  In reality, dont get all torn up about the "extras".  Oh, saves are important toO!!<br><br>You'll be fine!  From all you have written so far on this build, you appear to have put a million times more effort and heart into the build than most of us.  When you care that much, how can it be bad?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 03/22/09 03:21</span></i></p>
