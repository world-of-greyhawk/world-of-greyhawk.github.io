Would you kind folks help me build a Halfling Rogue with a the level by level progression and skills?  I have roughly made about the same character on a couple of different servers (only 1 got to 40 though), and each time there were mistakes and it could have been made a lot better; in any case I REALLY need some help maximizing the efficiency.<br><br>Guidelines:<br>This is a PvE character; there might be a little dueling but only a little.  Race is Halfling, I know that humans get an extra feat and every level another skill point, but I really enjoy the Halfling Rogue.  The build needs to be playable, so nothing that’s crazy hard until the end when it become s awesome.  I think Rogue 35/Fighter 4/Shadow Dancer 1 or another combination very near that.  The shadow dancer needs to be taken as early as possible, I am playing on a low magic world where it is hard to get items and almost no one has, however, there is no TRUE SEEING!!!!  <br><br>The feats I would LIKE to have are:<br><br>Two Weapon Fighting<br>Ambidexterity<br>Weapon Focus Daggers<br>Weapon Specialization Daggers<br>Improved Two Weapon Fighting<br>Improved Critical Daggers<br>Dodge<br>Mobility<br>Weapon Fines<br>Toughness<br>Epic Dodge<br>And Self Concealment 5<br>Epic Weapon specialization (Nice but not critical)<br>Epic weapon Focus (Nice but not critical)<br>Some extra sneak attack dice perhaps<br><br>I am not 100% sure that Self Concealment 5 is necessary, but I do want to have it.  It is good not to be completely dependant on magic items.<br><br>For Rogue abilities:<br>Improved Evasion<br>Defensive Roll<br>Crippling strike<br>And Slippery Mind (not 100% sure on this one)<br><br>As far as skills go, Search, Disable device, Pick Pocket, Open Locks, Craft Traps all rather useless here.<br><br>When I have done this before I used the starting stats:<br><br>Strength 12<br>Dexterity 18<br>Constitution 14<br>Wisdom 10<br>Intelligence 14<br>Charisma 8<br><br>If you can come up with better, then by all means PLEASE do!

STATS <br>any mix up with dex =20 . The reason for this is that it gives you more Epic feats since you get DEX =30 much earlier. If you time it right and start with dex 20 you can even get Self concealment 5/Epic Dodge by level 33. <br><br>1/ Rogue Dodge<br>2/ Fighter Weapon Finesse<br>3/ Fighter Ambidexterity, Weapon Focus<br>4/ Fighter <br>5/ Fighter Weapon Specialisation <br>6/ Rogue 2 weapon fighting<br>7/ Rogue <br>8/ Rogue<br>9/ Shadowdancer Improved Initiative<br>10/ Shadowdancer<br>11/ Shadowdancer<br>12/ Shadowdancer Improved 2 Weapon Fighting<br>13/ Rogue<br>14/ Rogue<br>15/ Rogue Toughness<br>16/ Rogue<br>17/ Rogue<br>18/ Rogue Improved Evasion, <br>19/ Rogue<br>20/ Rogue DEX =25 For Rogue 12/Fighter 4/ Shadowdancer 4 and 4 attacks per round <br>21/ Shadowdancer Great DEX (26)<br>22/ Rogue Epic Dodge<br>23/ Rogue<br>24/ Rogue  DEX 27 Great DEX (28)<br>25/ Fighter<br>26/ Fighter Epic Weapon Focus <br>27/ Fighter Great DEX 29<br>28/ Rogue 16 DEX (30) Self concealment 1<br>29/ Rogue 17<br>30/ Rogue 18 Self Concealment 2<br>31/ Rogue 19 Self Concealment 3    <br>32/ Rogue 20 DEX 32  <br>33/ rogue 21 self Concelmanet 4<br>34/ Rogue 22<br>35/ Rogue 23 <br>36/ Rogue 24 DEX 33 Crippling Strike<br>37/ Shadowdancer<br>38/ Shadowdancer (gets slippery mind)<br>39/ Fighter Epic Weapon Specialisation , Self Concealment 5<br>40/ Rogue 25 <br><br>For Shadowdancer 7/Fighter 8/ Rogue 25.<br><br>I like this build but it pulls 10 levels of rogue from yours. to get more shadowdancer (gets defensive roll and slippery mind). the extra levels of fighter get you max discipline epic weapon focus/specialisation. You lose 5d6 sneak attack however. If you dont want max discipline you can take a fighter level at a lower level. You can mix the rogue epic feats up a little so that you take criplling strike at the time you take SC 1, or 2 , or 3, or 4.<br><br>If you like the build Ill put together the skills for it for you <br><br>Syrath

Also what may be helpful beyond what has been listed here, is go to the builds forum and look in the index topic at the top. You can hit ctrl-f and type in a class or two and seach through builds that way. It is very handy.
