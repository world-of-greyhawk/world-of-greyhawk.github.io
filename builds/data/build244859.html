You've got enough AB to make using the kukris worth it for the threat range - one of the few kukri builds I've seen that can boast such a thing.<br><br>I don't think skill focus does much for you either, but I'm not sure what else you could put there.

Reporting from my experience of the Executioner, kukri is the way. And as you say, KD isn't even that necessary since you carve up anything fast anyway. A Dwarven Wall would get hurt even with the off-hand every blow in most settings. <br><br>I took the executioner up agianst three monsters in the Novice to Epic module, and had killed one of them when I died when using Greatsword. Dual-wielding kukri's was another story, it saw me victorious. Rangers is one of the build-types that really benefit from it when you have BoE. Good build. Bad saves.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 06/23/06 22:01</span></i></p>

IKD also allows you to KD larger creatures (i.e. you could KD a giant), but it's by no means a must-have feat.<br><br>Nifty build though Finn.<br><br>*edit* You know, it may be worthwhile picking up Stealthy instead of the Skill Focus feat. That way you boost both Hide <i>and</i> Move (albeit, the boost is +2 instead of +3).

I like it. Insane amounts of damage are always good. Just a thought though, while I'm sure your getting sick of everyone mentioning skill focus, but did you consider taking improved initiative? With regular initiative and that AC, you better just hope that roll better then them.<br><br>Also, why did you take blind-fight? It's a good feat, but without being an assassin casting darkness everywhere, it seems that it's just a precaution that could easily become a moot point.<br><br>Oh, and regarding your HP, 480 isn't <i>that</i> low... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Big Meph on 06/23/06 23:39</span></i></p>

NPC spellcasters routinely buff themselves with improved invisibility, let alone PC spellcasters, spellswords, battle clerics, and UMDers.  Blind fight is arguably even more important to a melee or archer than weapon focus is.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

As a point in Blind-Fight, most Cleric builds (strong buffed meleers) use Improved Invisibility thanks to Trickery Domain, and those are the moments when you curse not taking Blind-Fight, as you get your puny *** kicked. All undead and constructs immune to sneaks and crits, but for concealed, PvP is a whole different story.<br><br>Just as a note... random 7 enemies for PvM sounds ridiculous, it's on my thinking that sneak and crit immune enemies should take the honor of recieving BoE.<br><br>Anyway, cool build, I like the damage and all, nasty foe, this one might deal enough damage to take my Arcane Wall V2 frontally (or else I'll brag about it), pretty good.<br><br>Couldn't you change DEX for INT to take IKD? just thinking, those 2 DEX allow you 1 INT... and it's 1 AC loss for IKD, which aint that bad.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 06/24/06 04:35</span></i></p>
