You also should be able to take out two or more undead creature using the Great Cleave, very useful. Or, if you wanted to test it on the other player, it is possible to do. Just make sure that they don't have True Seeing on their stats. If you are lucky, you would be able to take the player out in two shots or three, which is within your limitations.<br><br>Other thing to notice, which is the hefty amount of HP. It should give you plenty time to destroy any single evil creature such as red dragon. Just have to get close enough to use your lay on hands or smite evil and it will be great sight to see... heheh. By that time, you will be down to at least 330ish or 440ish HP, depending on how often the dragon attacks. Also, they are very effective against Demiliches, ignore any minions that they summon and use those two ability and kill it in one or two shots. Once that occurs, the minions will disappear.<br><br>This character is not meant to use spells, but mainly focused on charisma and to use that to boost farther the damage for his abilities. So if you are using magical equipment, make sure you can get many charisma booster as you can.<br><br>Reason for taking so many Champion of Torm is that they give you extra feats every two levels pre-epic and every three levels post-epic. This is the only reason why I was able to get Great Smiting VII.<br><br>Reason for taking 7 Cleric level is that you only need that many for getting the last spell that is part of the Sun Domain powers(sunbeam). The Trickery Domain powers is covered by that.<br><br>If you have any suggestion on how to farther the amount of Smite Evil and other abilities, please tell me. I want to get more out of it.<br><br>Anyway, what do you all think about this build?<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.

Adding new update to this character.<br><br>I recently tested this character against one of Emrill's build.<br><br>I was able to score 500+ damage on the character when using smite evil and full powers, such as Divine Wrath, etc etc, and that includes the paladin's spells and cleric's spells.<br><br>On average, you should be able to score 230+ to 250+ on per smites. But when using against any evil character with epic dodge, don't use the smite as first attack because it will miss. Attack first then use smite.<br><br>If you don't believe it, ask Emrill. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.

This guy sounds intriguing - a whole build based on blowing up undead. I'm not familiar with Charisma-based characters so I really can't speak on that. But I have a couple of thoughts/questions for you:<br><br>1. What if you raised your cleric levels to get Greater Sanctuary? Isn't that more effective than Greater Invis? I think G.S. is a 6th level spell, so you'd have to take 9 levels of Cleric. That would impact your build significantly, but it would also provide some more buffs. If you went this route, you could select Healing domain which makes Heal spell a 5th level, so all your 6th level slots could be Greater Sanctuary. Or Harm. <br><br>2. How does this character fare against non-undead? Is he too single-purpose that he's vulnerable outside of an undead hunt? What about a non-evil opponent? Well now that I look back on your build I see he has plenty of HP's and Epic Weapon Focus in Greatsword. So I'm sure he does fine.<br><br>3. How many times can his Smite Evil and Lay On Hands be used per day/rest period? <br><br>4. Being unfamiliar with Charisma based chars, what type of damage is Smite Evil? Is this Divine? I'm just wondering what (if any) immunities would nullify this type of attack. ie In PvP what item/ability would an evil opponent need to resist Smite Evil?<br><br>Thanks for posting this. I'm thinking this is a pretty non-standard build that might just be very effective. <br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban.<br><br>PS - When you post builds, could you please not double-space? I find it really makes it hard to follow the build/feats/skills etc. Um, but you're the guild owner so of course you can do whatever you like! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">

Without those, you will lose couple attack and damage point.<br><br>If you don't care about the cleric buffs, you can take that out and take more levels in CoT, nine levels of paladin is enough to get most of the spells I think. If you took the cleric out and replaced it with CoT, you will get nine levels of paladin combined with 31 levels of CoT. That is good thing, why? That is because the more levels you take in CoT, the stronger the Divine Wrath will be which is very useful. Also you will be able to get more bonus feats.<br><br>But for high magic world, I think the magic user would be useless since you can find equipments that will boost your stats. So, it would be good to have focus on CoT and Paladin, but mainly on CoT. You don't want to do WM build because it requires many feats that seems to be useless in my opinion. And since you are taking CoT levels, it is basically the same as Fighter except that you don't get weapon specialization. But if you want to have both weapon specialization and epic weapon specialization, you will need to take four levels of fighter. You should take the fourth level on one of the feat selection, you will get two feats and you will be able to get both WS and EWS if you have taken epic weapon focus prior to that. Use the 21st level to get EWF.<br><br>I hope this post has been informative than being too long... lol.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.

Anuis,<br><br>I'm going to try this one out on my PW. I test-built her in the Novice to Epic mod, updating my Excel character sheet as I leveled up. In the interest of making your build more readable for everyone I will post the text export of my Excel file (cleaned up of course). The way I get the formatting to work for these boards is:<br>1. Copy Excel text to Notepad (to remove formatting)<br>2. Copy Notepad text to Word<br>3. Use Replace All to change the tabs to dashes<br>4. Copy from Word and paste straight to the message here. This presents a nice, tight level-by-level instruction that I find very readable. <br><br>Anyhow, I hope this helps.

Hey Anuis,<br><br>Can you explain why you picked Sun domain? I see that you did it for the Sunbeam spell.

Hi Anuis,<br><br>I'm starting your Death Hunter build on a new PW and wanted to know why you picked Greatsword as weapon of choice. Is it strictly a style choice? Or are there benefits for this character to use Greatsword? (Other than it's big and hits hard.)<br><br>My concern is AC - without a shield, a character loses a lot of AC. Also, don't paladins have the ability to enchant/buff their armor <i>and</i> their shields? If so, I would think wearing a shield would be more beneficial to this character. Especially since his major attack is Smite, not smackdown <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>My personal choice is usually to save Greatsword for Dragon Disciples, or other high-strength meleers, where the 1.5x bonus from strength plays a greater role. With Death Hunter's strength of 16, his strength bonus is only +3 (or +5 with a two-handed weapon). But in looking at the numbers (see below), his average hit with a greatsword yields 4.5 more damage over a longsword.<br><br>Here's how I see the damage: <br>Longsword: 1-8+3 --&gt; Ave. 7.5<br>Greatsword: 2-12+5 --&gt; Ave. 12<br><br>As I've said in other posts, I could focus in Greatsword, and carry a backup longsword &amp; shield for hard-hitting foes.<br><br>Anyhow, if you could share your thoughts on this I'd appreciate it. Especially my questions on enchanting the paladin's shield. <br><br>I created the character this morning and took Power Attack and Cleave for the level 1 feats, so I have some time to debate weapon of choice.<br><br>If anyone else can educate me on a Paladin's abilities to buff/enchant armor and shield then pipe in.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br>Check out the Epic Character Builders Guild<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Test your new builds in this mod:<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/modules/data/1073117317280.shtml" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

Paladins cannot buff their shields - but clerics can, with the spell Magic Vestment. Therefore a longsword + shield would be a good idea for this build.<br><br>Well, in PnP DnD, Divine Shield is used to buff your shield and is useless without one - but this is NWN.

A few things: <br><br>First off, to the person that was considering it: you can't do a Pally 9/CoT 31 build. You can only get a maximum of 30 levels in any prestige class because you can only take 10 levels before character level 21.<br><br>Second: If your WIS is only 12, you won't be able to cast Sunbeam. It's granted by your Domain, but only as a level 7 spell. Therefore you must have at least a 17 WIS to cast it. Perhaps you were thinking of Searing Light? That is a level 2 spell granted by the Sun domain (1d8 damage to a single undead per Cleric level, up to max of 10d8).<br><br>Third: Kaliban, with a STR of 16, you'll only get +4 damage with a greatsword (fractions are rounded down in NWN), so that reduces the average greatsword damage to 11.<br><br>Lastly: I was under the impression that Epic CoT got bonus feats every 4th level, not every 3rd. Is this incorrect? (I know it's documented that you get them every three levels, but I've read in various threads on the boards that this is inaccurate and they come every 4th level. Guess I'll have to do some testing...)<br><br>*edit* I just had another look at the build. You <i>are</i> getting bonus epic CoT feats every 4th level, so that's accurate.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 01/14/05 03:12</span></i></p>

Hello, I am currently using your build on a PW. I'm at lvl 18 now and am very happy with the character. Because I'm new to epic building I have a few questions.<br><br>I was surprised by your use of Taunt but after reading your comments on it I'm a convert. But I am confused by why you saved 44 skill points until lvl 40. Is there an advantage to doing that? I'm debating switching from Spot toanother skill since I'll be going after dracoliches and I don't have any trouble finding them!<br><br>I do have one suggestion that I would try if I were to do this build again and it may just be a factor for the PW I play on, but on the starting stats I would go with Str 14 and Wis 13. You wouldn't lose a Str modifier but you would gain access to 3rd lvl Cleric spells. I get a lot of Neg Energy attacks and being able to mem Prot from Neg would be very handy.<br><br>Thanks for sharing your work.
