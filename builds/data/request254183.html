Bear with me, please; as you'll soon see, I'm a real noob.<br><br>I was looking at the two-fisted weapon master (I don't know HTML, so I can't post the location elegently, but it is here):<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "204002", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>I thought it would be fun to make a rapier/kukri fighter with dev crit on both, and as wide a range of crits on both as possible.  First question: Is that absurd overkill?<br><br>I wanted to get the dev crit as early as possible; I managed to get the first one at 30.<br><br>I'm thinking of this as a pure PvM build, by the way.<br><br>On to other questions: Assuming the whole idea isn't idiotic in the first place, does anyone have some better ideas on how to do it?  The skills, as you'll see, are a complete mess, with tons of cross-classing.  I thought hard about taking a level or two of either rogue or bard for UMD, but ended up throwing up my hands and taking a final level of shadow dancer.  Also, at level 39 I ended up picking armor skin and epic prowess.  I'm not sure if that's a good idea or not, as I could really use KD and IKD for crit immune baddies.<br><br>Some notes about the PW I play on: A very high magic environment with level restrictions, so you can figure by the mid 20s to have all of your important stats maxed.  Also, discipline is pointless, because immunity to knockdown is easily found and no mobs disarm.  Devices to disarm traps are easily found, though opening locks is a useful skill, as is lore.  Healing is not.  Damage is not an issue, because it is easy to enchant items with preposterous amounts of damage.  Naturally, the weapons are use are also keen with 2d6 massive crits.<br><br>For RP purposes, I see him as a rogue who's build like a fighter.<br><br>As of today, I have him up to 23, and he's surviving easily, but then, fighters do that here.<br><br>There's probably important information about the PW I've left out, but I'll just go on the build as I have it.  If anyone has suggestions (beyond, say, "Why don't you stick to Diablo II?") I'll be glad to hear them.

Oh, right.  Human, any alignment.<br><br>And why the point in dex?  Because it bugs me have that odd number, and because for RP reasons I prefer him in light or no armor.

Rapier and kukri just for RP reasons.  I see him as a rogue, a highwayman.  I just can't him with anything in his right hand except a rapier.  And rapier and dagger (or kukri in this case) just feels right.

YOu may be new, but this isnt a noob build!  Very nice attempt.<br><br>The one thing with this is you are trying to do ALOT with this!  TO get wm, dev crit AND dual!  WOW!  And you do it.  This is good.  Taking kukri means you loose yet another feat to exotic.  I am wondering, if it is a high magic world, you could get away with dagger that you craft to look like a kukri!  LOL<br><br>The reason is to try to get more wm lvls.  You only take 13.  Goin to 19 or 22 will allow you to get wpn of choice in both wpns AND higher ab etc.  It would take some planning.<br><br>I like the idea of slash and pierce.  Dont let anyone tell you NOT to do it!  ITs a cool thing, IF IF you have the feats!  WHich you do.  <br><br>Its up to you bout more wm lvls.  Hope my 2 cents was worth it.<br><br>LMAO!  I totally missed your 40th lvl!  I wouldnt take sd.  ROgue gives you MUCH more.  Even a bard (which would allow dis to be maxed at 43.. which is low), but requires your alignment consideration (which it doesnt as it sits).  You arent a sneaker.  You get nothing from HIPS, other than a quick get away, but IF this char would need that, then the thing you are facing isnt something you should be facin, if you get what i mean.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 09/30/06 23:58</span></i></p>

You've a nice crit range with the WM levels, but I wonder if it's worth it? Can you hit the mobs on a roll less than 15 or 16? If not, then WM levels are a waste of time.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Much thanks for the feedback; it was useful.  I'll kick the thing around some more and see if I can come up with something decent.<br>_________________<br>"The difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between the lightning and the lightning bug." -- Twain

Sorry I took so long, been having computer troubles.  Here are two alternatives that do what you are looking for; with enough skill to max out a few others areas if you want.
