Here's an idea for a human version:<br><br>STR 16<br>DEX 10<br>CON 14<br>WIS 8<br>INT 10<br>CHA 16<br><br>With 16 STR, and +8 from 10 levels of RDD, you'll only need to put one more point in STR to qualify for dev crit.  The rest can all go to CHA.  If you're going to be wearing full plate, DEX isn't important.  You'll be hurting a bit for skill points early on, as you'll need to take lore to 8 for the RDD.  Other than that, you'll be able to take spellcraft, concentration, and discipline to near max by the end.<br><br>It's an idea at least.<br><br>Steve

If you can't use dev crit, you can drop the strength further.  IF you still want overwhelming crit, you can drop the STR to 15 and then not need any STR boosts other than from RDD.  That will also give you 2 more attribute points at the start...INT could be a good use for them.<br><br>Steve

Yeah, for the most part, sorc/pal/RDD builds tend to be of the 23/7/10 variety, which means only level 1 paladin spells anyway even if you had the WIS for them.  You could raise wisdom a bit...but honestly, you're a sorcerer.  You don't really need level 1 paladin spells.  The paladin levels are really just for AB, Divine Grace, and Divine Might/Shield.  But, it's up to you...you could always lower strength more.<br><br>Steve

So, sorc just for true strike, bull's strength, eagle's splendor, that sort of thing?  Well, that will work for sure...I'd drop strength more in order to raise wisdom then...you'll get STR from the RDD levels after all, and you're mostly planning on using your CHA for damage too...sure, worth a shot, <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> .<br><br>Steve

I'd be tempted to make a Paladin 25/HS 5/CoT 10 for a fully "abusing charisma paladin".

Well, I'd just use the CoT levels to rattle through the great smiting feats and the HS to get the charisma up to qualifing level fairly early, I think I have one of these with great smiting 7 and a natural charisma of 37 somewhere.

Come to think of it.. we could drop Paladin to 15 if we felt like just hitting it's max spell casting stats (apart from duration and other misc stuff) and going 20 CoT for EVEN BETTER divine wrath.. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  I need to go test this.. MEEP!<br><br>-DaMouse
