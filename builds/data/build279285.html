I put together this build to solo through the module S!: Tomb of Horrors. It's very heavy on traps and secret doors, designed for a party including a high level rogue. The final boss is Acererak, a Demi-Lich (and souped up to be as fearsome as they were in Baldur's Gate II). While a Cleric or Paladin is very useful in the final battle, most such builds will never make it there by themselves without a Rogue to lead the way. This build is intended to be a Paladin who is nearly as good as a Rogue himself. <br><br>There is one other build with this level split: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "222567", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Of course, it's one of Grizzled Dwarflord's - he and I seem to think along similar lines more often than not. Grizz's build was a Cha-based Great Smiter, with Rogue primarily used just for Tumble and UMD, plus a few points here and there. This one is Str-based, with Rogue at level one to build up a store of skill points for later dumps. Skills are focused on Search and Disable Trap (to handle the environment he was designed for).<br><br>Acererak's Bane:<br>Rogue(4), Paladin(26), Champion of Torm(10), Human<br>STR: 16 (32)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 14 (18)<br>INT: 10<br>CHA: 14<br>Hitpoints: 504<br>Skillpoints: 171<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 32/26/27<br>BAB: 29<br>AB (max, naked): 44 (melee), 29 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 19/30<br>Spell Casting: Paladin(4)<br>Disable Trap 30(30), Discipline 43(54), Search 30(30), Tumble 40(39), UMD 28(30)<br><br>01: Rogue(1): Blind Fight, Knockdown<br>02: Paladin(1)<br>03: Paladin(2): Weapon Focus: Greatsword, P: (Smite Evil)<br>04: Paladin(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>05: Paladin(4)<br>06: Paladin(5): Extend Spell<br>07: Paladin(6)<br>08: Paladin(7): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>09: Paladin(8): Toughness<br>10: Paladin(9)<br>11: Paladin(10)<br>12: Paladin(11): STR+1, Improved Critical: Unarmed, (STR=19)<br>13: Paladin(12)<br>14: Paladin(13)<br>15: Paladin(14): Extra Smiting<br>16: Paladin(15): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>17: Rogue(2): Ro: (Evasion)<br>18: Champion of Torm(1): Power Attack<br>19: Champion of Torm(2): Cleave<br>20: Paladin(16): STR+1, (STR=21)<br>21: Paladin(17): Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>22: Paladin(18)<br>23: Paladin(19)<br>24: Paladin(20): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR=23)<br>25: Paladin(21)<br>26: Paladin(22)<br>27: Rogue(3): Great Strength II, Ro: (Uncanny Dodge I), (STR=24)<br>28: Paladin(23): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=25)<br>29: Champion of Torm(3)<br>30: Champion of Torm(4): Great Strength III, Great Wisdom I, (STR=26), (WIS=15)<br>31: Champion of Torm(5)<br>32: Champion of Torm(6): STR+1, Great Wisdom II, (STR=27), (WIS=16)<br>33: Champion of Torm(7): Great Strength IV, (STR=28)<br>34: Champion of Torm(8): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=17)<br>35: Champion of Torm(9)<br>36: Champion of Torm(10): STR+1, Great Strength V, Great Wisdom IV, (STR=30), (WIS=18)<br>37: Rogue(4)<br>38: Paladin(24)<br>39: Paladin(25): Great Strength VI, (STR=31)<br>40: Paladin(26): STR+1, Armor Skin, (STR=32)<br><br><br>Notes:<br>I used the CoT levels for Great Wisdom for an extra level 3 and 4 spell per day. You could certainly use them to pick up Dev. Crit instead, but that wasn't a focus here since he was designed for Demi-Lich killing, and undead are immune to crits anyway. <br><br>His Search and Disable Traps are high enough to spot and disable anything but Epic traps reliably. He'll usually spot Epic Traps in a few rounds, and even disable them with a few buffs or items.<br><br>His saves are quite good, and he has Evasion. He can self-buff with Aura of Glory, Eagle's Splendor, and Bless and Prayer for another +8 to all saves (and if he can pick up some Cha from items he can get to +10).<br><br>AB is quite good (44), and of course he can do all the usual Pally buffs for another +14 or so. He can also use Divine Wrath for another +2 (it should last at least 5-6 rounds when self-buffed, up to 8 if fully buffed). AB is high enough that he can afford to use Power Attack if he is up against a high DR enemy, or switch to Sword and Board if he needs more defense (his AB with other weapons is still 41, not bad at all).<br><br>He can Smite for +36 damage 3 times per day - not a main focus of the build, but not bad either. <br><br>His normal damage is quite nice - 2-12 + 16 unbuffed, up to 2-12 + 25 (buffed Str) + 5 (Divine Favor) + 5 (GMW or HS) + 2 (Prayer and Bless) + 3 (Deafening Clang) + 1-6 vs. evil (HS) + 2-12 vs. Undead (Bless Weapon). So even on a normal hit, he will punch through a Demi-lich's 30 DR just with base damage every time, plus the magical and divine damage that will bypass it. And that's with a mundane greatsword. <br><br>TM

Acererak in S1 has been souped up - he has a scripted soul-sucking ability very similar to Kangaxx's Imprisonment. Luckily, it is disabled if you are in single-player, but it tends to freak out parties who don't expect it when the first couple of players disappear.... It's a well-designed module, lots of unusual special scripted events, designed to slowly creep out a party. Works really well with a DM, especially if he is a bit on the sadistic side.<br><br>Unfortunately, you need to take PA to qualify for Divine Might/Shield, so you could only drop Cleave. Given his low Cha, I thought Cleave would be more generally useful (not vs. Demi-liches, but in getting to them). I actually considered taking Improved Power Attack (which I vey rarely bother with), since he has the AB to afford the -10 to hit, and the +10 damage will help beat the 30/- DR.<br><br>TM

I like the build. Though, I would consider Divine Might/Shield. I know that a base 14 CHA is nothing special but, as you and Thax already stated, you can buff it up nicely with spells and items. Getting +8 to +10 to Damage or Armor class is nice. I would atleast consider dropping Cleave for Divine Shield myself. Just a thought. Good build TM.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By galelabriel on 07/23/07 15:14</span></i></p>

Nicely done, TM. Which ToH module did you play this one in? I took one of my Rogue/FTR/CoT builds (Favored of Moradin) through Ghool's mod and he rocked. A Pally/Rogue combo would be tres cool though. May have to run through it again...<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Tried it once with a neutral halfling version of Grizz's Zhentarim Scout, and had a heck of a time at the end since he couldn't use any of the custom items intended for killing Acererak (halflings can't use a Greatsword due to size, and he couldn't use the artifact mace due to alignment, even with a 35 UMD). Finally managed to whittle him down using scrolls of Bless Weapon, but it was painful. I didn't want to use the Executioner, seemed too cheesy. This guy made it much easier.<br><br>On the topic of Divine Might/Shield - I wouldn't bother with Divine Shield, the duration just isn't worth it. When you need AC, just switch to a real shield and a longsword or other weapon, you've got plenty of AB to handle the loss of 3 for WF/EWF. If you want, you could take Dvine Might in place of either Cleave or Improved Crit (since undead are immune anyway). I wish you could take Great Cha as a CoT bonus feat, that would make it more useful, but you can't. I wouldn't drop Iron Skin and Epic Prowess - I like having good AC (especially since he primarily uses a greatsword) and AB. Cleave is more dispensable to me, since it makes the biggest difference against mobs of weaker enemies who generally aren't that much of a real threat.<br><br>There is no problem keeping Cha buffed - he can buff it by 9 with his own spells, you just need to pick up 3 more from items to max it out, but it's still only 26 (+8 for 8 rounds). Of course he can do it quite a few times (up to 11 if you can max Cha without spells). Of course he can already do a fair amount of divine/magical damage from his normal buffs, but every bit helps.<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 07/23/07 19:25</span></i></p>
