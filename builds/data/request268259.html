I'm looking for a human melee strength-based fighter, any allignment.  What makes this a challenge is the world: very high magic.  Absurdly high magic.<br><br>Here's what I mean: Saves don't mean squat, because there is protection from almost everything.  You can figure on being hasted, and, yeah, there is dev crit, but the bosses are all crit immune, so it doesn't matter.  Things like barbarian rage are useless because they don't last long enough to be worthwhile against the bosses, who take oogots * 10 hits.<br><br>You can figure you'll have a +20 weapon, +12 on all ac catagories, and things like weapon spec are meaningless because another 4 hit points isn't worth paying attention to.  And, yeah, you'll have damage reduction; so will everything you fight.<br><br>The usual solution is to go dex-based, and let the obscene amount of damage on the uber weapons deal with it.  But I want to figure out if a strength-based character can work.<br><br>Why am I even bothering?  The RP is good and my girl friend likes it there.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Two things matter: AB and AC.  So...with that in mind, any suggestions?  And, yeah, in this case he needs to be human.  I've been checking Fighter/PM builds, but none of them that I've seen have good enough AB.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By skzb on 03/12/07 23:27</span></i></p>

Fighter 10/Bard 20/RDD 10. Take 4 fighter levels pre-epic. Max Taunt. Start Str at 16, put all points to Str, end at 40.<br><br>AB: 26 base, + 4 (WF/EWF &amp; EP) + 21 (buffed Str) + 2 (Bard Song) + 5 (Curse Song -5 to enemy AC) + 6 (Taunt) = 64. Then add +20 from your uber-weapon = 84. I am not sure if the +2 to AB from Bard Song counts against the +20 cap or not, the rest definitely does not.<br><br>AC: 10 (base) + 2 (Armor Skin) + 4 (Draconic Armor) + 8 (Tumble) +1 (dex in heavy armor) + 8 (heavy armor) + 3 (tower shield) = 36.

His KD/Disarm is also more effective thanks to song. <br><br>Thanks to Lasting Inspiration, he can sing after rest and only have to use Curse Song at the start of a battle. Both will last through a long battle easily (100 rounds). He can cast all the Bard spells, can use any scroll, wand, item, etc.<br><br>I didn't pick a weapon, you can go for a single-handed weapon to use a shield for AC, or a 2-handed to get the 1.5X damage bonus (from +21 to +31) and the large weapon bonus for Disarm. <br><br>I skipped Imp Crit, WS/EWS, and Overwhelming/Dev Crit since you said they don't matter for this server. You said not to worry about saves, but you could easily swap out Fighter for CoT to get +5 to all saves, better base saves, plus the CoT Divine Wrath, a weak Smite, etc. Only costs you 1 pre-epic feat, which you have to spare. You will need to move the CoT levels back a bit (after you reach BAB 7), but you can still easily fit in 4 pre-epic. The Smite may actually be worthwhile for the AB bonus - your base Cha of 16 gives +3, buffed will give +9, pushing your max AB up to 93 (granted, only 3 swings per day, and only against evil). Take Extra Smiting if you go this route.<br><br>TM<br><br><br>P.S. Is the KZ for Karl Zoltan?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 03/13/07 00:50</span></i></p>

My only question is if you are losing too much AB by taking so many bard levels pre-epic.  Not to mention, are you losing an attack?  Number of attacks can be pretty crucial.<br><br>Yes, KZ is for Karl Zoltan.

He gets 4 attacks - 16 BAB. You can take more fighter pre-epic, and lower Bard to 16, but you lose Lasting Inspiration. Bard song AB and AC bonuses are the same, but fewer skill points. Take Lingering Song pre-epic to make the song last 15 rounds (not as good as 100, but better than 10). Oh, I forgot to include the song bonuses in the AC - effectively +7 to AC.<br><br>Nice to meet you too.

The reason I favor Bard/RDD over WM or fighter levels is simple - you end up with higher AB.<br><br>WM: Gets at most +7 AB from ESWF (at level 28), and 2 or 3 higher BAB for a total of +10.<br><br>Fighter: Gets at most 3-4 higher BAB.<br><br>Bard Song: +2 to hit, +5 AC<br>Curse Song: -2 to enemy AB, -5 to enemy AC<br>Taunt: -6 to enemy AC<br>RDD gets you +8 to str, +4 to AB<br><br>Net is +13 to AC and +17 to AB, signficantly higher than even the level 28 WM build. <br><br>TM

A DEX based WM build with good criticals and Epic Dodge is probably one of the best choices.

I still favor the Bard/RDD build - more spells, immunities, RDD AC boost, more skillpoints, song AC bonus, song skill bonus, curse song skill penalties for enemies, etc. It's more than just the AB. Plus, if the challenge is to go str-based, then let's go all the way. You can't get much more str-based than a Ftr/Bard/RDD. <br><br>But if you want to post a str-based WM build, by all means put it up. They are certainly good builds, although a bit focused on crits, which he already said weren't useful due to immunities. If Dev Crit was useful, then a WM Scim or Kukri build would be ideal.<br><br>TM

Not bad. Bard song bonuses are weaker, but he can dual-wield, which could be useful in high magic, especially if weapons have useful effects like True Seeing. You should also note that he gets +2 to AB vs. the Favored Enemies thanks to BoE.<br><br>TM

Is there Critical Immunity items on this server?  If not, I would think Palemaster would be a good choice.  Something like, 20 Bard (for Lasting Inspiration), 4 Fighter (all pre-epic as EWS isn't a huge factor), 16 Palemaster (for Epic Warding + EMA).<br><br>The AB isn't huge, but with taunt/curse song and +20 weapons, you should have favorable AB, and plenty of AC.

Okay, Monk.  I've leveled up to 40 and taken on several of the bosses.  So far, with a belt that has crit immune, or a different one that has immunity to Harm, he's damn near untouchable, and is able to hit almost all of them, and is happy to have a duel of rolling 20s with the few he can't hit.  His effective AB is 75 which includes bard song and war cry, but, oddly, not taunt.  All the bosses must have discipline in the 90s; I haven't gotten off a successful taunt yet.  As you can imagine, disarm does nothing either.  It might have been worthwhile to sacrifice a point of strength for ESF: taunt, I don't know.  Probably not.<br><br>All in all, a most successful build, and exactly what I was hoping for when I asked.  Thanks much!

Taunt is resisted by concentration, not discipline, but that is a bummer. They are resisting it even with Song/Curse song active? I wonder if it counts as a mind-effect, and they are immune, or something. Hmm... <br><br>Anyway, I am glad the build worked for you.<br><br>TM

Anyone still reading this topic?<br><br>First, thanks again for the all the help.  Tattoed Monk's build worked quite well, but I'm still looking for more.  I'm no longer comitted to a strength build, but race is limited to human or half-elf, which cuts out a ton of good things (like all the uber Dwarf builds, for example).<br><br>Some additional limitations and points that make this absurdly high-magic world interesting:<br><br>Saves don't matter; you have items that give you immunity to everything you might worry about.<br><br>AC is HUGE.  Did one of the AA half-elf builds, and he can't survive the bosses because his AC (with gear) is only 96. *Only* 96.  How do you get higher?  You get your friends to help you score a particular shield that gives shield defense of 1+20.  So...he must use a single-handed weapon and be able to use a shield.  Right away, that takes out any dual-wielder, and all monks.<br><br>Yeah, it turns out all the bosses have insane Discipline and Concentration; we can forget taunt, knockdown, and disarm.  On the other hand improved expertise is a must; there are some bosses where you just have to accept that you're rolling for 20s, and you need to stay alive while you wear them down.  This also means number of attacks is important.<br><br>Forget damage, it doesn't matter.  You're getting such absurd damage from the top-notch weapon you scored that the difference between d4 and d12 just doesn't enter into it, nor does EWS.<br><br>Forget crits; all the bosses are crit immune.  (And several of them can dev crit you, which is another problem; if I could find a PM build with insanely high AB and AC I'd die happy).<br><br>The minimum AB to actually hit the bosses is about 50 (which turns into about 75 with your +20 weapon and +12 ability items).<br><br>And forget all those cool, sexy Paladin or Blackguard temporary boosts; the bosses will be around a long, long time after those have expired.<br><br>Sneaking?  Heh.  True seeing all around.<br><br>Oh, it would be an extra benefit if he could pickpocket, so I could go in and snatch those damned "heal" potions the bosses seem to carry around by the case.<br><br>And he needs have decent discipline, or he'll get disarmed.  It doesn't have to be great--there are  items that will boost disc. by 50 or 60.  But he should have some.<br><br>The good news is there is no need to worry about anything except how he looks at level 40; leveling is easy. Exp penalties don't enter into consideration.<br><br>So there it is.  In essence, I guess what I'm looking for is someone who hits like an AA, but has AC like a monk, and can carry a shield.  Impossible?  Hell yeah.  But I'm having fun trying.<br><br>If anyone has any ideas, I'm listening.<br>_________________<br>"The difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between the lightning and the lightning bug." -- Twain

Perhaps they were afraid of dwarves... yep, definitely that's the reason.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Sorry for the confusion.  The world has all the races, and then some.  I'm dealing with the RP concept I'm working on, not the limitations of the server.<br><br>Good suggestions, there.  Hmm...barb/rogue/sd...I'll do some checking on that.  Thanks.

Note that SKZB specified Human for RP. That gives an extra pre-epic feat, so no problem qualifying for WM. It does cost you 1 AB and AC, since Dex will start at 18 instead of 20, but the build still works. You also have more skillpoints to play with.<br><br>You could go with the more typical Ftr 10/WM 28/Rogue 2 and pick up a few more points of AB (4, I think), but you lose Epic Dodge. For a battle of 20's, I would take Epic Dodge over a few more AB.<br><br>TM

One question about this server - are there good traps available? If the bosses are so hard to hit, you may be better off with a rogue-heavy build that takes Skill Mastery and ED and SCV, pumps up Set Traps, then just sets traps around the feet of the bosses. SCV and ED should keep you alive, and if there are Deadly or better yet Epic traps available those may be more effective than weapons. Player set traps have very high DCs, so unless the bosses all have Evasion and really high reflex saves they should be quite effective (and even then, negative energy traps and frost traps cause a fort save, and sonic cause a will save). Also, Acid Blob and Frost traps can paralyze, and Sonic can stun, either of which may make them much easier to hit.<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 04/02/07 19:51</span></i></p>

FinneousPJ is a moderator, he can edit any post at any moment, just go back to where he posted the build and it's been corrected; the term "swap" means to exchange positions, not to lose one for another.<br><br>But Tatooed Monk is right, the real modification will be to go human, no feat problems with that.
