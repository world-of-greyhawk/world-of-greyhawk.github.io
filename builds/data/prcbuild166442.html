The Transmuter (Wizard 10/Eldritch Knight 19/Shifter 11)<br><br>The transmuter is a versatile and adaptable mage. He is a potent spellcaster, but can use his many abilities to assume any shape he chooses, making him a deadly combatant or an impenetrable wall if needed.<br><br>Ok, enough with the spiel. This is probably one of my better attempts at combining wizardry with combat.

In many undead or construct forms, can stand around unbuffed casting spells at will without getting hurt.<br><br>Cons:<br><br>Only 33 caster levels, and only +39 to SR checks (beware of monks!)<br><br>Some of the better shapes only come at epic levels, and only 1 epic wildhape per day.<br><br>Crappy will save for a wizard.<br><br>Some notes on levelling:<br><br>The order was selected to acquire good defensive shapes as early as possible, namely giant, construct and outsider. The combat feats were kept at a minimum, to enhance the spellcaster side, but you can take more combat feats, and stop raising intelligence after 20 if desired.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mr_Raider on 11/24/04 01:16</span></i></p>
