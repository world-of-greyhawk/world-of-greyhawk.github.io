I am new and hope I'm not making an obvious mistake here, BUT...I want to make a Matrim Cauthon build.  If you read the books you know he is a terribly lucky, unfortunate who stumbles into, and out of, trouble more than a drunk drinks.  He has some rogue, some bard(?), and perhaps fighter in him.  But that is what I am here to ask about.  What do you builders thinks.  I am a beginner, and I don't want to screw this up.  <br>I'd go human, probably monk first as he generally goes without armor, and can mix it up.  Fighter with a Dire Mace, but maybe just a spear...what do you think?  And Bard, maybe not.  He needs to be as immune to magic as physically possible for a fighter type...really no spell casting for this character at all.  What to do?<br><br>This isn't as power build persay, but should be pretty strong if these perimeters can be met.  I hope this type of request isn't taboo...thanks and I'll be waiting.=:<br>_________________<br>Calling out to the little known class of Bard-barians.  Your brute creativity has been acknowledged!

I have read all the Wheel of Time books and as understand Matrim, he is not a bard. he uses a spear, but I agree he is very lucky and does have a lot of charisma, so maybe a fighter/monk/CoT would be a good way to represent him.<br><br>Just my 2 cents....

No, I don't recall anything "Gleeman" about him either. I'd say high charisma, monk to emulate the saving throws as well. Lots of WoT builds revolve around monk.

Matrim and Rand traveled on thier own after losing Thom.  He had shown them how to play some instruments that they played, on their journey, to make a few bucks.  It was very "as needed", and they get away from it, but yes, there is some Bard there.  Try the first or second book.

And, Mat was trained in quarterstaff.  The weapon he ends up with is NO spear...sorry.  I am not asking about the story, I'm trying to make the character.  If you need pages for me to verify what I am saying I want the build to be, I'll do it, but it seems unneccessary.  I am not wrong about Mator the series...no matter what anyone may remember.  Matt already had the Mordeth's knife and they were traveling through the largest cities in the lands.  One lvl bard is easy on this.

So, to the point.  Would Dire Mace offer more than the non-exotic options?  It seems that a Dire Mace might capture the essence of the ashandarea better than a spear or quartestaff.  Is there any reason not to use a dire mace?

The Eye of the World: Chapter 31<br><br>Play for Your Supper  <br><br>Summary<br>Rand POV - Rand and Mat travel the road from Whitebridge to Caemlyn. They hide when mounted patrols pass. Rand keeps hoping to see Thom come up from behind. Mat keeps fingering his ruby dagger. They spend their first night out of Whitebridge outside on the ground. They are running out of money and cannot afford to stay at an inn. Rand asks Mat about selling the ruby dagger, but Mat gets angry. They stay at several farms and get some meals in exchange for a few hours work. After several days they arrive at the Grinwell farm and Master Grinwell invites them to stay the night. The eldest daughter is Else Grinwell.1 She starts flirting with Rand. Mistress Grinwell has yellow hair, which Rand has never seen before. The Grinwells suggest that Rand and Mat play at inns. Mistress Grinwell is suspicious of Rand's intent for her daughter and is happy to see him leave. The next day, at dusk, they enter the village of Arien. <br><br>There is only one inn, and the innkeeper lets them stay there and have a meal in exchange for them performing. The next morning, Eazil Forney gives them a ride out of town. Rand and Mat continue traveling in this manner for several days and then they arrive at Four Kings. <br><br><br>I am just way to serious about this.

It's been while since I read the Original WoT as I have been reading through the rest of them with great interest, I do restate as in my ORIGINAL post, that I feel a fighter/monk/CoT could be the way to go.<br><br>I am not here to argue over the finer points of the WoT series as everyone's perspective of the characters is different.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By saidinspain on 02/19/08 08:08</span></i></p>

Very true.  Yes...but I was doing the same, giving my thoughts on the character, and requesting a build based on those.  I agree completely that the Bard issue is minimal to insignificant.  I suppose I took offense at being told he isn't a bard, as I hadn't claimed he was a bard...however, performance, lore(huge for this character) and apraisal(?) come into play....thus possibly bard.  I never intended to have to justify any of my thougts on the character.  I understand that its a reach...but it is semi-valid.  If one finds bard irrelavent, don't suggest it.  But there is no reason to imply that it is wrong or unjustifiable.  To mention it is to open the discussion, which I could justify.  Sorry if it coes across as rude.  But it seemed to me that my veiw of this character was being called out.  I think that a defense of "opinion" goes both ways and if respected  the initial comment isn 't made...or we justify our claims as I did.  <br>As far and weaponry, I am still unclear on what makes one weapon more beneficial than any other when of the same class..ie small, medium, large/exotic, martial, druid, so on. <br><br>All and all I apologize for coming across as rude.  I still see this as somewhat backwards, as it is okay to question my view, but not alright for me to validate it.  I did a repost and asked in a more NWN-build friendly way as it is clear that character based requests are too difficult to really agree on.  My mistake was in the very title of my post.  <br><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 02/19/08 17:06 (GMT) -- galelabriel<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 02/19/08 14:18 (GMT) -- Bwootza Baa<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 02/18/08 10:41 (GMT) -- saidinspain<br><br>I have read all the Wheel of Time books and as understand Matrim, he is not a bard. he uses a spear, but I agree he is very lucky and does have a lot of charisma, so maybe a fighter/monk/CoT would be a good way to represent him.<br><br>Just my 2 cents....</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>You WERE here to argue.

Hello?  Matrim is totally a Rogue <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    Fighter/Rogue/something would be my bet to be honest.  Mat is always sneaking around getting into trouble; playing pranks etc.  That is a big aspect of rogue to me.  He also has many skills learned and even mastered as a youth; which reflects even more strongly on rogue.<br><br>He is clearly an excellent fighter when pressed; but prefers not to if he can help it; so the fighter levels are perfect for the skill he would have.<br><br>As for a third class; many could possibly come to mind; but I suppose my choice would be Champion of Torm.  It is true Mat isn't really a Champion of any God; but he is very much a Champion of the Dragon.  The class also reflects well his stunning luck (raising saves), natural leadership (special abilities) and continuing skill (max AB progression).<br><br>Personally I just don't see Monk in the character at all.  Rand Al'Thor is certainly monk based; but Mat is as far from Lawful as you can get.<br><br>Just my opinion of course <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By 4SakN on 03/19/08 21:34</span></i></p>
