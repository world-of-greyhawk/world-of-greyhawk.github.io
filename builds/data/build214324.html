(Please note: This character was designed to see what could happen using three classes that I suspect are underutilized. The original intent was to see if these underdogs could be restored to some semblance of glory.)<br><br>The Vengeful, Wicked Spirit<br>Barb4/Blackguard 16/Druid 20<br><b>playable 1-40, PvM</b><br><br>As he watched his precious forest burn from the spellcasting of the foolish mage, his anger burned just as hotly. This was not the first time he had watched some idiotic city-dweller bring destruction and ruin to the pristine lands the savage man-beast inhabited.<br><br>'Fools!', he thought. 'They act as though the very land is theirs to do with as they will, as if they could somehow obtain through force what could only be had by acqueiscence. They are slowly destroying this world, and will disturb the natural order of things forever!' He could hear them clearly, boasting about the deed they had performed, laughing as they dragged the steaming carcasses of a deer and several different types of birds that had been burnt beyond recognition by the drunken mage. <br><br>Slipping through the trees on the side of the camp that was still not burning, he took a count of their numbers. Besides the foolish and inebriated mage, he noted that there were at least four or five well armed guards. <br><br>Pondering, he realized that to initiate conflict with them would risk uneven odds. As the fury built within him at the injustice, he heard a grating, urgent voice speak to him, "Quench your thirst for vengeance! Submit to my will, and I shall grant you powers beyond your wildest imaginings! Become my champion, and I shall set you against those who would seek to ruin your lands! Forsake your oaths to protect life, and instead deliver death to those deserving of it in my name! Swear your oath now, or forsake it forever, for I offer it only once!" <br><br>He was helpless to locate the source of the voice, but he intuitively sensed it's malign power. Though he had always acted in his own self-interest, he knew that once he submitted to such a being that his soul would forever be rejected by the forces of good. But the potential power! Torn by indecision, he briefly forgot where he was--until he suddenly felt a white-hot pain erupt in his shoulder, and looked down to see a bloody wound! "Look 'ere, lads--I've found me a wild 'un! Come and join the fun!" <br><br>The well-armored man before him grinned and slashed the glyph-laden longsword that he bore through the air, as if in invitation. "Come on, then, if ye have the might."<br><br>No longer unsure, he stood up and spoke in a clear, crisp voice. "I submit to your will, infernal one. Now, infuse me with the promised power that I may send these fools to their graves!"<br><br>---<br>And now, the build:<br><br>Druid(20), Barbarian(4), Blackguard(16), Human<br>Alignment: MUST BE Neutral Evil<br><br>STR: 16 (26)<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 15 (20)<br>INT: 12<br>CHA: 10<br><br>01: Barbarian(1): Power Attack, Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>02: Druid(1)<br>03: Barbarian(2): Cleave, Bb: (Uncanny Dodge I)<br>04: Barbarian(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>05: Druid(2)<br>06: Druid(3): Great Cleave<br>07: Barbarian(4)<br>08: Druid(4): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>09: Blackguard(1): Toughness<br>10: Blackguard(2): BG: (Smite Good)<br>11: Druid(5)<br>12: Druid(6): STR+1, Improved Critical: Greatsword, (STR=19)<br>13: Druid(7)<br>14: Druid(8)<br>15: Blackguard(3): Maximize Spell<br>16: Blackguard(4): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>17: Blackguard(5)<br>18: Blackguard(6): Blind Fight<br>19: Blackguard(7)<br>20: Blackguard(8): WIS+1, (WIS=16)<br>21: Druid(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>22: Blackguard(9)<br>23: Druid(10)<br>24: Druid(11): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR=22)<br>25: Druid(12)<br>26: Druid(13)<br>27: Blackguard(10): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=17)<br>28: Druid(14): WIS+1, (WIS=18)<br>29: Druid(15)<br>30: Druid(16): Great Wisdom II, (WIS=19)<br>31: Druid(17)<br>32: Druid(18): STR+1, (STR=23)<br>33: Blackguard(11): Great Strength II, (STR=24)<br>34: Blackguard(12)<br>35: Blackguard(13): Epic Toughness I<br>36: Blackguard(14): STR+1, Great Strength III, (STR=26)<br>37: Blackguard(15)<br>38: Druid(19)<br>39: Druid(20): Epic Prowess<br>40: Blackguard(16): WIS+1, Armor Skin, (WIS=20)<br><br>Hitpoints: 468<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 27/24/15 (+8 vs. spells)<br>BAB: 28<br>AB (naked): 40<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 16/27<br>Spell Casting: Druid(9)<br><br>Total Skillpoints: 226<br>Suggested Use:<br>Concentration 43(44), Disable Trap 1(2), Discipline 43(51), Heal 4(9), Hide 5(5), Open Lock 1(1), Spellcraft 42(43), Taunt 43(43), Tumble 20(20)<br><br>+22 to allocate as you see fit<br><br>Strengths: <br><br>1)Barbarian Rage(2x/day) + Max'ed Bull's Strength + Aura of Vitality = Max str. bonus.

The reason is I wanted to see what could be done with what I consider to be the top three either under-utilized or simply under-powered classes. Granted my building skills are rudimentary at best, but so far I'm still convinced that I've found one of the worst class combinations out there (cue the inevitable HS comments). I'd love to be proven wrong by getting advice on how to improve this build, though--'cause I definitely like the concept <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br>_________________<br>Favorite PW's: Hall of the Worlds, Higher Ground, World of Iniquity.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 09/27/05 19:56</span></i></p>

The strength of this build must be roleplaying x) Nice little background story, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br><br>I would suggest taking Epic Prowess as your level 13 Blackguard bonus feat so you could take Epic Skill Focus: Taunt at level 39 (or earlier). A stronger Taunt is always nice ^^ You would only lose 20 HP. Not a big deal <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>EDIT: oh, and you could start with 8 Dexterity and 12 Charisma for a +1 boost on saves <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>Now is my day's work done;<br>I'll take good breath:<br>Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of<br>blood and death.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 09/27/05 16:38</span></i></p>

This is bad boy and it's so fun... it's almost evil. Druids and Blackgaurd seem like such a confortable match. I've been trying to make a Divine Might/ Shield Druid/ Blackgaurd and this really has given me some ideas. Thanks, great job.

It's going to be an important skill for this AB-starved evil bastage.  <br><br>I agree it's a shame that the build doesn't utilize the charisma bonus that BG's receive--you could easily make that change without too much difference with the build.  I just didn't do that since the AC loss hurts in an already AC-poor build, and I have a moral/RP objection to the idea that a blackguard would benefit from charisma---in fact, getting a bonus for having a LOW charisma makes more sense to me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I've always loved the concept of anti-paladins/shadow knights/dark knights---it's just too bad they made them a rogue-esque pet class in NWN, which doesn't match my image of them at all.  I always imagine a somewhat honorable but misled individual whose powers would basically be the anti-thesis of the paladin, but that's just me.<br>_________________<br>Favorite PW's: Hall of the Worlds, Higher Ground, World of Iniquity.
