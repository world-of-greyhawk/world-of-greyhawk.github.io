You're raising 4 attributes. At worst, you should concentrate on only 2. One is even better. This build is going to be too watered down and unable to do anything well because of this.<br><br>Dump CHA, since you don't need it for anything.<br><br>You need WIS of 18 to cast all the spells to which you'll have access, so that's a good decision. Next, you should decide if you want to go with STR or DEX and raise that one single attribute as high as possible.<br><br>Feats:<br><br>You're taking Spring Attack in epic levels, with a build that has Tumble as a class skill. Drop it. High Tumble ranks makes Spring Attack ompletely redundant.<br><br>Drop Epic Will. Will is your high save as your build stands.<br><br>Dodge may be useful, but Mobility is not really needed in this build.<br><br>I would drop Rogue completely and just cross-class skill points to qualify for Assn at level 13. Take an Assn level or 2, then perhaps SD (in which case, you'd need the Mobility feat) Go CLC 16/Assn 24/SD 2 (I'd go heavy DEX in this build, BTW)<br><br>I also wouldn't burn a feat for martial weapons.<br><br>Improved Sneaks... meh. You'll have lots of sneak damage anyway. I'd concentrate on getting my AB high (Weapon Focus, Epic Weapon Focus, and GRT attribute feats)<br><br>That's my 2 cents.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Thanx for all the input and helpful tips.I guess I have a little rebuilding to do.I know it's kind of sad to create a build on the fly,but I'm not one to sit here and think it out first..maybe I should...lol. So I take it that it could be a viable build then dropping rogue and goin with 2 lvls of SD instead.<br><br>So I should take Cleric to lvl 12 then 2 lvls of Assassin,then 2 lvls of SD,then 4 lvls of Cleric,and the rest in Assassin?<br>_________________<br>Would you offer your throat to the wolf with a Rose in it's mouth?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Marcus Whitewolf on 06/17/05 04:19</span></i></p>

I might consider saving that last Cleric level until late to top up Spellcraft though. I'd also go high DEX with this build as well. Take your WIS to 18 and put all other attribute increases into DEX. You'll want to go with Weapon Finesse this way, so you'll need a finessable weapon. Your choices would be:  Mace, Sickle, and Dagger. If you choose to take the Martial feat, then I'd opt for the rapier (if you're going sword and board, otherwise I'd dual-wield short swords)<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Thanx again for the replies..that is what I did WIS to 18 and puttin the rest into DEX...but I also kept with wpn prof martial..and gonna be very different from anything I've seen and use a halberd..so far it is working out pretty good..I got her to lvl 7 so far,but I figure it to be a slow build but hopefullyshe'll be able to hold her own.<br>_________________<br>Would you offer your throat to the wolf with a Rose in it's mouth?
