Hi all, <br><br>   I was just looking at and trying to build the Primeval Champion. I see it takes epic weapon specialization on level  27 which is listed as a COT level up. I thought epic wp specialization was only for fighter and had to be on a fighter level. I only see 4 fighter levels in the build and all are pre- epic. Is this a typo or something?<br><br><br>                          Thanks, Mano<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick. Long ago I learned to strike swiftly and without scruple. I trouble no man without cause, but one who attacks me had best resolve himself to die!

COT due to a feature/bug is allowed to take EWS as a feat. It cannot take standard weapon specialisation however.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

Well, that's good to know in case of building a fighter / cot and not having to work in a fighter level post epic just for ews.<br><br>                      Thanks for the response!!!<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick.
