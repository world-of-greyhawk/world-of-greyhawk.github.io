Figured I'd post another non shifter build.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>A friend of mine was looking for an AA with HIPS, so I looked around and only saw a few.  He wanted a very good BAB.

(clairaudience/clairvoyance grants +10 spot/listen too)<br><br>Didn't go with any Self Conceal because it's expensive and with UMD you can Improve Invis / Displacement yourself via scrolls.<br><br>Last Bard level was taken at lvl 15 for a feat level (lingering song) and skill dump spot pre epic.  Could be pushed to level 18 if you want, no big change however.<br><br>Didn't take the usual last Bard Level (9) @ 40 for skill point dumps because it took away an AA bonus feat and an AB.  The trade off was not really worth it to me.  I wanted 8 bard levels pre epic to get that extra +1 AB from the song.  Helps alot when leveling.<br><br>As with any build on here, salt and pepper to your taste.<br><br>Twang in D minor was in reference to the Twang of a bowstring and/or a musical instrument.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Nice build. It's amazing actually how similar yours is to Lady Marion (Wildwood Maiden), Bard8/AA22/SD10 (by myself and Tatooed Monk, a BAB 27 archer w. HiPs ASAP and ED at 27, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "271264", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> being part of the Wildwood/Robin Hood series and yet to be added to pulse's engine (nudge, nudge, wink, wink); whereas we went for offensive power (36 dex hence +2 AB, +2 AC, +2 reflex among a few other differences, incl. weapon finesse and +60 HPs over Twang, but you went for 43 more skills and a straight-archer instead (w. the ESFs and lingering being a nice touch). <br><br>Although I'm biased (as everyone knows) in favor of AB, heh, I like yours too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">          <br><br>That said, and I hear you re: the playable factor in getting bard 8 for the +1 song pre-ep, I personally would recommend delaying that bard until the end so you can top out your UMD, etc. (thereby enabling use of all scrolls, cross-class/cross-alignement gear, etc.) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>Otherwise, nice twist on a classic, Bromium, as you're right, guild ain't exactly overruning with singing HiPs archers (and nice to see a non-shifter from you ~ Tyr <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">    <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good [people] to do nothing" -- Edmund Burke, Philosopher and Politician (1729-1797)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 09/07/07 04:14</span></i></p>
