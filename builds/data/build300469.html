This build focuses on buffs based off charisma and Wisdom using nothing but brains to augment the lack of power you might normally have with any other power build. The up side you can focus on ether the aspect of archery and still have a fair amount of magic to use or focus on magic and have something to fall back on when you ran out of spells. Ether way you can keep your distance while pelting away evil doer’s hit points or giving them the grand finish of implosion or harm (Heal if undead)<br><br>The down fall to this build lack the hit points to start with many fighters have near 600 hp on their own merit alone. Saves to fortitude and reflex are shoty at best but great in will department. Based on what gear is around you can hit hard in low power campaigns with divine base damage with little resistance to the damage. The problem there is that you need charisma with out many out side sources to beef up your shiny smile they last for short 1 time burst and divine might deals even less damage.<br><br>Proper planning and good role play make this a fun build since you bring out a powerful archer with out relying on being an elf (Which can also work with this build if you don’t mind having less hit points) which can have a small burst of divine hitting power of 65 AB with just your normal longbow extra equipment and using spells like word of faith gives that little extra edge as well as the flexablity of normal clarics.<br><br>What can help this build become stronger?<br>Good cloth armor<br>Boots of the Sun Soul<br>Belt of Dexterity or Belt of (a giant &lt;insert type here&gt;)<br>Bracers of Speed<br>Cloak of Nymph<br>Amulet of Wisdom<br>Composite Bow (keen if the server has one)<br>Helm optional couldn’t think of a good common found item to help with anything dramatic change to beef up the build.<br><br><br><br><br><b>DIVINE ARROW - CLERIC (23), CHAMPION OF TORM (15), MONK (2)</b><br><i>Human, Lawful Good or Lawful Neutral</i><br><i>PvM Build 37-67 CR</i> (Based off of 3,300,000 gp. max item value based from Kamiryn’s Character Build Calculator spreadsheet)<br><br><br><br><b>ABILITIES (ending)</b><br>STR: 13<br>DEX: 12<br>CON: 8<br>WIS: 17 (28)<br>INT:  10<br>CHA: 14 (18)<br><br><br><b>BASIC STATS</b><br>Hitpoints: 350<br>Skillpoints: 133<br><br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Reflex/Will): 29/27/36<br>Saving Throw bonuses: 8<br><br>BAB: 26<br>AB: 38/33/28/23<br>AB w/buffs (Including War Domain Power and Divine Wrath): 65/60/55/50 min.<br><br>AC (naked): 30<br><br>Cleric Domains: War and Magic (Magic Optional)<br><br><br><b>SKILLS</b><br>Concentration  43 (42)<br>Spellcraft 41 (41)<br>Tumble 43 (44)<br>Remaining Points 6<br><br><br><b>LEVELING GUIDE</b><br>Character Level- Class (Class level): Feats<br>01- Cleric (1): Toughness, Power Attack (Turn Undead)<br>02- Cleric (2): Weapon Focus<i><b>*</b></i><br>03- Cleric (3): <br>04- Cleric (4): WIS+1 (WIS 18)<br>05- Cleric (5):<br>06- Cleric (6): Zen Archery<br>07- Cleric (7):<br>08- Cleric (8): WIS+1 (WIS 19)<br>09- Cleric (9): Divine Might<br>10- Cleric (10):<br>11- CoT (1): (Lay on Hands<i><b>**</b></i>)<br>12- CoT (2): Combat Casting, Weapon Focus-Longbow (Sacred Defense), WIS +1 (WIS 20)<br>13- CoT (3): (Smite Evil<i><b>**</b></i>)<br>14- CoT (4): Point Blank<br>15- Cleric (11): Divine Shield <br>16- CoT (5): (Divine Wrath<i><b>**</b></i>), CHA+1 (CHA 15)<br>17- CoT (6): Improve Critical-Longbow<br>18- Cleric (12): Spell Focus (Evocation)<br>19- CoT (7):<br>20- Cleric (13): CHA+1 (CHA 16)<br><i>(Epic)</i><br>21- CoT (8): Great Wisdom I &amp; II (WIS 22)<br>22- Cleric (14):<br>23- Cleric (15):<br>24- Cleric (16): Improved Combat Casting, CHA+1 (CHA 17)<br>25- CoT (9):<br>26- CoT (10): Epic Weapon Focus-Longbow (Divine Wrath<i><b>**</b></i>)<br>27- CoT (11): Greater Spell Focus-Evocation<br>28- CoT (12): CHA+1 (CHA 18)<br>29- Cleric (17):<br>30- CoT (13): Great Wisdom III (WIS 23)<br>31- CoT (14): Great Wisdom IV (WIS 24)<br>32- Cleric (18): Epic Spell Focus-Evocation, WIS+1 (WIS 25)<br>33- Cleric (19):<br>34- Cleric (20):<br>35- Cleric (21): Armor Skin<br>36- Cleric (22): WIS+1 (WIS 26)<br>37- CoT (15): (Divine Wrath<i><b>**</b></i>)<br>38- Cleric (23): Great Wisdom V (WIS 27)<br>39- Monk (1): Epic Prowess (Evasion, Cleave)<br>40- Monk (2): WIS+1 (WIS 28)<br><br><br><i><b>*</b>Any Melee weapon this is only needed for CoT requirements staff might be a good choice<br><b>**</b>This skill is very useful for this build but focus on Cha</i><br><br><br><br>I will give a shout out to <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117756", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Bytewaste's (CLC 22/CoT 17/Monk 1)</a> build but the differance is largery clear that this build is focus completely on the buffs you get and not Dev.

How can you say that 15 cot is better than 28 cleric? (you didnt say that, but you took 15 cot leaving out 28 cleric).  I have to think that a build like this needs cleric spells?  You are dispellable.  Why not switch the 5 to cleric?  You DONT have extend spell which means your buffs will last only 23 rounds.. not too long im afraid.<br><br>There are so many tweaks i could give.  Drop spell focuses.  Take cot10 in epic for extra epic feats.  Why add to charisma?  for divine might?  Your 4 stats will make little difference and can better be used as AB in wisdom (not to mention spell slots (a few anyway)).<br><br>Since 10 cot would be taken in epic (to give you 15 bab at lv 20 - standard POWER cleric), you would have a pretty easy character to level.  Then monk isnt necessary til lv 37 for skill dump.   Now you gain 29cleric and a epic cleric feat.  <br><br>I would suggest dropping combat cast and Improved.  These feats are generally the default feats for the nwn engine, and were put in so that the default characters would suck!  You have a high concentration so taking 2 feats is a waste.  Also with the tumble you shouldnt have to many problems with AOE.  <br><br>I apologize for Min/max suggestions.  I only really play clerics so i have alot of things i like to see in the builds.  If this were a melee build strength based you could get away with more cot.  imvho, with the way you designed the build, the one more wrath just doesnt seem to justify loosing all those caster levels.<br><br>I would add extend spell and silent spell to the mix, btw.  These are 2 essentials.  If you must keep foci, that is cool.  I find that SOV is a much better stunning spell vs implosion.  What will occur in game is that you will probably be a imploder (which means you neeed even more wisdom) OR a bower, not both.  The reality of the build is you are only a mediocre imploder and a mediocre bower, so you will end up runnign alot.  Take Trickery domain for II so you can run easier.<br><br>Sorry for the length.

lol, you jerk!  You actually made me consult the wiki!!<br><br>First, the argument you have vs cleric is from a lack of understanding of the DIVINE power of the class.  Your argument about +2 ab/dam took me abit to understand.  So what you are saying is that you feel 5 levels of cleric isnt as beneficial as +2?  Now you are talking about another 5 lvls to get +2 again?  *faints*<br><br>First, my suggestion was to go wisdom based only for stats.  TO go 20 straight lvls of cleric, leaving 10 cot for epic lvls.  Then to go 28 or 29 cleric with a monk lv for tumble.  WHy?  2 spells.  Divine Favor and Divine power (there are others, Battletide, prayer, aid).  Divine favor grants you +5 damage for 1 turn per spell.  With a high wisdom cleric AND extend or silent feat, you can have as many as 12 or more (iirc i had 19 or 20).  That is +5 damage!  Also +5 to ab.  <br><br>Now, your ab.  I checked the patch info to make sure this is still true and it looks like it is.  One of the secrets of the epic character guild (seems that only we talk about it wrt clerics..) when you have a cleric, you want to keep ab to 3 APR.  This allows you to Get a 4th apr when you cast Div Power at FULL ab, not 38/33/28/23 +5 like you would get in your build.  This gives you one extra attack at full ab to HIT for Damage!  And your ab goes up +5 aswell.   The duration is 1 round per lvl (unextended).  23 rounds is short for a fight.  I have tested it many times.  It seems to fly by.  <br><br>So, by adding more cleric lvls AND extend spell you get MORE ab and can cast MORE divine damage (more cuz you have that extra attack at full ab, vs 23+5 for your last one).  <br><br>I did make one error in my suggestion above: KEEP epic prowess too.  I didnt say loose wf/ewf (those are necessities).  <br><br>If you dont have perma haste, take travel and trickery for domains.   The domain feats SUCK!  Typically uses are one per day!  oohhh.  Compared to what is suggested, there is no contest.<br><br>The reason for silent spell is an extra slot lvl for harms/heals and possibly mass heals.  SOV will be an excellent stunning tool for you (you want to stop them attacking you so that is great) and firestorm is a great mass destruction spell (especially when you cast them ontop of each other).  If you are not focusing in high wisdom (28 isnt really that high), dont go implosion route with spell foci :evo.  Yes, the exploit is nice, but it wont be powerful enough for you to rely on, vs the firestorm/sov combo.  I play on a server with TWEAKED monsters (there hp is higher than normal nwn) and that combo works amazingly!<br><br>I even looked up combat casting/icc.  While combat casting seems good on paper, to save +4 to concentrate (when you make it with CON bonus) is NOT worth the feat, imvho.  THe wiki even says that a caster with 27&lt; concentrate (which you have) the feat ISNT worth it.  I have NEVER used the defensive cast mode.  I dont think i have ever played with someone who did.  Things, by your own admission, die to fast when you really know what you are doing to even care to switch.<br><br>In light of all this, it is YOUR build.  you will do what you will.  My suggestions are based on 1000s of hours of cleric playing.  I dont know much, but i know how to make a cleric TOUGH.  Sad but true. <br><br>Now im goin to cry for all those lost hours playing with divinity  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cry.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 11/27/07 23:01 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I agree with avado, Storm of Vengeance rocks, it stuns great, it can deal heavy damage over time, and Evasion doesn't work against it, you should try it in your strategy as well, too bad it's conjura</div></blockquote>

Heya.  I'll try to be clear and to the point.  While I see your reason for the 15 CoT in this build, I also don't think it's worth it, and for several reasons:  Undispellable Cleric buffs are a good thing (they live off of buffs), and of all the classes, they have the easiest time hitting the AB Cap.  With just Divine Power, Divine Favor and GMW, you are already only 5 away from the ceiling.  Toss in Bless, Aid, Prayer and now you're only two away.  Turn on Divine Wrath for some extra damage, and while it's giving you 7 divine damage per smack, you're only going to get +2 AB out of the deal since you're hitting the AB roof.  <br><br>My suggestion to you would be do go Cleric15/Monk1/CoT3 pre-epic.  You'll have to drop a few pre-epic feats, but you can afford to drop some of those.  I would also drop starting Wisdom to 16 and throw those 3 points into Str and Con.  You'll still be able to hit that final WIsdom score of 28 (actually you can get higher if you want), you'll raise your final AB. Fort save and give yourself another 40 HP.  Also, this maximizes your Divine Power potential, and you will be laying down some serious smackage when you turn this on.<br><br>Now, with the majority of CoT now being taken in Epic, as well as getting another Cleric bonus feat, the field is wide open.  You can keep ICC if you want.  The thing with ICC is that it depends on how you play and who you play with.  In a party environment where the other members of your team tend to rush headlong into a room, ICC may not be a bad idea, for it will give you a bit more ducking room as you weave through the field to Heal/Rez fallen comrades.  I think you can live without it, but there's nothing wrong with taking it either in a Cleric build where you'll be needing to keep your party breathing.<br><br>With 10 stat increase to Wisdom and two Cleric bonus feats, you can still get to Wis28.  With 4 CoT bonus feats and 7 general feats in Epic, you can still nail the following feats:  EWF, EP, AS, Epic Spell Focus, 4 Great Charismas, ICC, and then you'll still have two feats left over (Great WIsdoms, perhaps?, or Epic Spells?)<br><br>Then you can add two more Monk levels somewhere for some added Tumble drops... something like Monk1 at Level12, again at Level22, again at 32 and then at 37.  This will give you the added AC at just the level where the Tumble bonus grants it.  <br><br>I'm sure I said what's already been said, but sometimes it just sounds better when it comes from someone else.  Good job, and well done.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

These three classes, though, will often not be willing to waste their best dispelling spells for limited results.<br><br>Furthermore the divine damage of divine wrath goes through damage resistance and damage immunity making it guaranteed damage against a potentially well protected creature.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By WhiZard on 10/07/08 02:20</span></i></p>
