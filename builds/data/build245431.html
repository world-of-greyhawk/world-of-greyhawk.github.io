Nice idea really, but I don't understand why Bard is taken to 35th level, purely because your Bard &amp; Curse Song is capped at 30th level. <br><br>You could get 5 levels of Fighter in instead, quite comfortably, giving you a better AB overall, and 2 more feats, with the option of getting Weapon Spec and Epic Weapon Spec, or even KD, IKD and Blind Fight.<br><br>Aside from that neat!

I like it. Lots of tasty Bard levels! A few tweaks I'd consider:<br><br>1) Take Bard at level 1 and FTR at level 2. Gives you 8 more skill points at no loss other than to delay your acquisition of heavy armor and your +1 AC from Tumble by 1 level.<br><br>2) I'd take Extend Spell over Empower. Extend your Wounding Whispers and it will last almost as long as your Bard Song with Lasting Inspiration.<br><br>3) Totally optional, but you could delay raising CHA to levels 12 and 16, since you don't actually need 15 CHA until character level 14. However, that would delay when you can cast your level 3 Bard spells by 1 level and it means you don't get your bonus level 3 Bard Spell until later.<br><br>4) I'd take a Bard level at level 17 to top Tumble, but that's just a minor playability tweak.<br><br>5) I'd drop 2 of your GRT STR feats and pick up Epic Prowess and Armor Skin. Net loss is 1 damage and some carrying capacity. Net gain is +2 AC. You break even on AB.<br><br>6) Another thing to look at is your CON. Your HPs are relatively low for a melee character, so you might consider dropping DEX to 8 (you can cover it with Cat's Grace) and raising CON to 16. I don't generally like to go with the low DEX, but it's an option.<br><br>As far as the less Bard/more FTR angle, I like the added CHA for the build (and extra level 1 and level 5 spell per day), which the Bard bonus feats provide. I think I'd keep the 35 Bard. Besides, you get style points for so many Bard levels. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...

I echo Cin's suggestion on Constitution.<br><br>I would also advise dropping Power Attack and Cleave for Blindfighting and Knockdown.  Or perhaps Blindfighting and SF: Perform, and then drop two Great Strengths for Epic Prowess, ESF: Perform.  It seems that with 35 Bard levels, you need all the Perform help you can get.  <br><br>I might even consider dropping 3 Bard levels for 3 fighter levels in Epic, and use those bonus feats for things like AS and EP.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Thanks for the constructive comments and suggestions.<br><br>@ Cinnabar:<br><br>1) I like the idea of taking Bard at lvl 1. Bards need all the skill points they can get.  <br><br>2) The Empower / Extend swap is a toughy; they both have their merits (I have an unhealthy addiction to casting my stat buffs Empowered).  Of course having my Wounding Whispers last longer when I am in a protracted fight would be more beneficial than an extra 1 modifier to Str and Cha.  <br>(Is is just me, or does it seem that Bards are starved for both skill points and feats?)<br><br>3) I'll probably leave it as is; but it is a good consideration depending on what type of stat boosting items you are running across as you are leveling.  (ie. with a +2 Nymph cloak, you my as well boost your strength first.)<br><br>4) ah, yes.<br><br>5) Good idea on Epic Prowess and Armor Skin.  I hate to see that Shiny, Round "30" drop to a 28  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> , but it is worth it as this build need more AC.  Of course, with +12 Strength items, it would cap at 50, which is nice and shiny and round  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>6) Yeah, the HP bother me as well.  I hate going through those 6-7 levels with 2 less AC, but I also hate running out of HP in a battle <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   Well, I suppose Belt/Bracers of Agility are usually pretty easy to find early on as well (at least until I can cast Cats Grace), so what the heck.<br><br>_______________<br><br>@ G. Dwarflord:<br><br>A good suggestion, but alas, the game won't let me.<br><br>When I was originally fleshing the idea out, I actually tried to split my levels with 2 Fighter and 3 Blackguard, but I couldn't take Divine Might on my 3rd Blackguard level (BG 16, BG 17, BG 18). Perhaps the Turn Undead doesn't "register" until after you have selected your feats.<br><br>So then I tried to take my 3 BG levels and then take Divine Might with a Bard level (BG 15, BG 16, BG 18, Bard 18) ; but apparently you can only take Divine Might on a Blackguard level.  I'm still running 1.66, so I don't know if that was something that was fixed in 1.67 or not.

know its an old post, but is it any use to have both still spell and extend? I mean you cant cast a stilled extended spell right?

There are some round per level spells like haste and wounding whispers that you might not be walking around with.  Most of the time you can take off your armor, cast them extended and then put your armor back on.  However if you get ambushed, you'll want to put them up in combat and that's where still spell comes in handy.  It also helps if you want to use a spell like darkness, invisibility, clarity or silence in combat.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
