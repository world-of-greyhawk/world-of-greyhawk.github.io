Forgot to mention you can replace Skill Focus Perform for Still Spell if you intend to use a shield, personally I didn't use one opting instead for dual wielding some +hide/move silently weapons

I love this particular build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Except I usually put most point increases into CON and take 3 BG levels and 2 SD levels.  This way I get evasion.

Yeah I just thought it'ld be interesting to make a full charisma bard at the time..I get bored easily and making weird builds like this one lol..or a druid/wm/shifter that focuses on epic Drow form, or just refining existing builds it just amuses me for some reason

Actually going full CON and taking AutoStill II makes him quite easy to level.  You're a decent caster (well, you've got Grease and Ice Storm.. what more do you need?) as well as Wounding Whispers which works well in conjunction with having tons of HP.

True enough it's just generally easier to get con from gear/buffs then it is to get perform and 100 perform is a rather high number to get to with low charisma especially if you can't craft your own gear after all even epic gloves of the minstrel are only +30 perform<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Revenant Mattlov on 02/27/09 10:45</span></i></p>

Skill Focus: Perform could be replaced with Divine might just switch a BG level around if you want it. As for why make it the bard song, curse song and taunt should be enough of a justification in any party and if needed Taunt can be switched out for Listen thereby becoming the party stealth detector as well. As for items..I've decided I'm not going to make a melee cause I have to get like..armor and swords and stuff, I'm also not gonna make a caster cause then I'ld have to get robes and items to boost my casting stat, also not gonna make a archer..I'ld need a bow I can keep going but I think my point is clear enough: Nothing can reach it's fullest potential without items<br><br>As a note I wouldn't consider a party wide +7 AC +19 skills and a +7 AB boost through curse song that isn't included in the +20 AB cap as a character that brings nothing to the party, not to mention the fact that you can still act as a buffer through things like GMW, Keen Edge, Imp Invis and all the stat buffs except endurance<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Revenant Mattlov on 02/27/09 20:40</span></i></p>

Sure but I built this bard for its song and survivability, hence it focuses on its song and survivability also something to note I've never made all purpose builds there's plenty of those around, I focus on 1-2 things and make the build excel at it just how I am so..if you want jack of all trades builds don't look at mine <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

Yeah Displacement is a very overlooked spell kind of a shame really it's saved me more times then I can count especially since it doesn't have to be stilled not to mention a 1d6 + 35 WW which for the most part is never touched as a damage shield for server changes lol
