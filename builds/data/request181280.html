Some people say they have mastered this build and it's like one of the best ever. Anyone ever seen a build like this before?

Actually I think they need to be specifically sneak immune. I play mostly PM builds in pvp and sneak attacks still get me. The only way I know of to get sneak immunity is to be a Risen Lord, or possibly some other shifter form. Of course against a risen lord, just cast heal and laugh.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

Go 25 lvl cleric, and people will have a seriouse problem dispelling you.. 10-11 lvl rouge and get cripple strike.. Get KD, each time you KD someone and get sucsessfull sneak attack will their str go down by 2.. 4-5 lvl monk)..<br><br>Your buffs will be very hard to dispell, cleric without their buffs = weak..<br><br>Domains: (depends a bit on the equitment they have) I would say travel and trickery(or war).. Dualwielding kamas will you get like 7-8 attacks with flurry strike, 1 more with hasted, divine power (Do I belive) gives 1.. so you will end up having like 10 attack/round.. Remember to max displine, tumble, use magic device (and maybe spot aswell against PP <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> )
