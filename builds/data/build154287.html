Just use Defensive Casting mode and save yourself a couple of feats.<br><br>2) No real reason to take 9 Monk lvls that I can think of.  Gets you Improved Evasion, but you could just as easily get that on a Rogue level.  If you were to go Rogue 16/Monk 6/Cleric 18 you wouldn't really lose much, but you would gain 1d6 sneak attacks and a few more skill credits.  If you go Rogue 17/Monk 6/Cleric 17, you have now gained 2d6 sneak attacks over your original build.  <br><br>3) You may want to consider going Halfling rather than Human.  You can get a higher AB and AC with Halflings; the only real disadvantage is that you suffer a penalty with IKD.  <br><br>4) If you want more health, try lowering Str to 10 and taking Toughness rather than Improved Critical.  You lose 1 point of damage and crit 5% less often, but you gain 80 HP and 1 Fort save.

sorry crispy if this was a copy of your build, I've never looked at any monk builds out there and made this myself in the OC (well not all the way of course), and I thought it worked out just fine.<br><br>1. I didn't know about defensive casting... does it let me cast while fighting without incurring AOOs? and I hate expertise, it's no good for a meleer since the general idea with a melee char is to actually kill things, not just stand there and not get hit. and it's just lame to use it with casters, shouldn't be possible at all IMHO, but this discussion has been on every forum far too often for me to bring it up again. let's just say I don't want it.<br><br>2. I want 9 monk lvls for +30% speed if nothing else, I really love RUNNING around. plus I really want 18 lvls of cleric for castings, so 16 rogue would only give me 1d6 bs dmg, which I can spare. trade off is 10% speed vs 1d6 bs dmg... choice is yours.<br><br>3. 12 str is nice both for +1 dmg (which isn't much) and being able to carry more, so mostly for practical reasons. the build would probably be better of with 10 str 14 con, good point there, I just prefer to play with at least 12 str with melee builds.<br><br>sorry again if it was a copy, wasn't intended as one, but I guess most good builds have been posted by now <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">
