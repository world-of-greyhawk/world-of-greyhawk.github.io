I tried to made it a Shadow Dragon, I really did, but there's no way, dragon shft's are green, red and blue, and barkskin changes its texture to.... um, bark, but nothing black.

If you go with your own level split or not, you get WIS 30 at lvl 28. Why not take a druid level at char level 30 to get Dragonshape then? <br>And when Kail says something about Dragons, it is right. Build it up in a test module and watch the combat log for your AB. Then relevel, but remove WF, EWF and you'll get the same result.

You want to know why I chose Halving? quite simple, check the feats, CoT really eats all useful feats pre-epic, and halving has some bonuses: +1 size bonus AB, +1 size bonus AC, +4 to Hide checks, +2 to move silentrly and listen checks, +1 to all saving throws, +2 to fear type saving throws, +1 racial bonus with throwing weapons (ok, this last is useless), I like that stuff. Skills.... anyway I don't know what else to use.<br><br>I also tested that stuff about the WF..... at least <b>on my PC and version</b> works fine, this is what I did:<br><br>I just made a druid with shapeshift and wrote the BAB and AB, then shapshifted into bear and wrote the AB, then leveled up with WF: unarmed, my BAB increased 1, but my unshifted AB increased 2 as should be, then I shapeshifted again, and the AB had increased by 2.<br><br>On a second test, check my build, unshifted +28, unshifted you can't deny it works, counting the +19 STR modifier with the unshifted currently -2, AB goes up to +49, and it does, if WF adn EWF wouldn't work, my shifted AB would be +46.<br><br>If you say the character sheet is wrong, then the +49 it states is not real? that could be an understandable bug.......... so I made a field test against a combat dummy in Prelude, since they don't take damage, and my AB was counting +50 on the roll information, I guess the halving size bonus added or something, but I didn't lost the WF or EWF bonus to AB, so, too bad if it doesn't works for you, it does work for me, so I'll keep it like that.<br><br>I could take the DS in earlier levels, but I took it very late to add more spellcraft and get it to 40.<br><br>The level 8th druid spells could be useful, although I think Premonition is the only level 8 bluff, but you don't get full monk speed at level 3, although it increases a bit, 10% more.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/13/06 22:32</span></i></p>

Have you taken into consideration dragon's +6 claws and -2 AB due to size (huge)? <br><br>You see the sheet show your AB calculated this way:<br><br>AB (sheet)= BAB (26)+ STR mod (19)+ WF (1)+ EWF (2)+ EP (1) = 49<br><br>or AB (sheet) = 46 without WF/EWF<br><br>The real AB takes into account different factors:<br><br>AB (real)= BAB (26) + STR mod (19) + EP (1) + dragon claws enhancement bonus (6) + size modifier (-2) = 50<br><br>Therefore the sheet is off 4 points if you didn't take WF/EWF feats or 1 point if you did take them. No halfling racial boni apply, sorry. Test with <b>combat debugging enabled</b> (without it tests can give some unreliable results) and you'llsee for yourself, you don't have to trust my word <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>About the rest, halfling bonus to AB/AC due to size is lost when you shift, AB bonus to ranged attack is lost since you have no ranged attack as a dragon, the only thing you keep is the +1 to saves but with 24 CoT lvls last thing you have to worry about is saves IMO. Unshifted all halfling boni apply, and the ranged bonus is useful if you take Zen Archery. Still, human is a good choice and CoT is not giving you all the nice preepic feats: what about disarm/ID coupled with huge sized claws or expertise/IE? Human would also remove XP penalty (which you have for all of your career practically but maybe that's no issue to you, I'm just pointing it out),and  give skill points could be used to max out hide/MS (not bad for someone with a dex of 36), take some animal empathy for those difficult early lvls, and heal or cross class skills (some ranks in open locks f.e.). BTW, tumble needs only 40 ranks and spellcraft either 38 or 43. You are not taking advantage of Halfling bonus to DEX either, and the +1 AB gets balanced by the further -1 AB due to 6 STR.<br><br>About the lvl split I suggested, you'd lose 1 from saves (but that's no biggie) for some more speed and lvl 8 spells. I disagree that premonition is the only useful spell, especially given your dragon natural DR and anyhow you could extend aura of vitality with lvl 8 spell slots. Besides, by taking 15 druid lvls you could pick up DS at 30th lvl and still max out spellcraft at 40th lvl (43+2=45 for +9 saves vs spells) which would net you a +1 to saves vs spells.<br><br>A final consideration is that, saves apart, going druid 28/CoT 10 would probably do you more good (or maybe druid 24/Monk 6/ CoT 10), you'd have increased spellpower, elemental forms, a stronger companion for just one epic feat slot (and considering EWF doesn't do any good when shifted...).<br><br>It's all just friendly suggestions, mind me... apart the fact WF/EWF: unarmed do not work shifted , that's just how it is <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 02/14/06 01:43</span></i></p>

Then the race change fits in....<br><br>I'm not thinking in fighting unshifted, that's why I said only Premonition, I know druid spells, but that's the only "bluff" I see useful, I didn't really mean all level 8 is no good.<br><br>I took several CoT levels for the saves and the divine might, which gets very strong and can be used shapeshifted, when I thought on increasing Monk, you get Kd and IKD, but CoT bonus pre-epic feats works even better, 1 AC and some speed, and for some more IE, but Evasion is already impressive enough with that reflex, also, CoT works as an epic class since CoT level 11, which gives me more feats, changing the EWF will help on the feats, but WF was pre-epic, so I'm not sure what to choose there. I could increase the druid, but aqs long as Divine Might stays strong, I like it.<br><br>Have you seen the Animal Companion? nobody seems to notice, but their AC is so freakin' low! their AC doesn't increases unless that companion increases in DEX, I might think of using it if my character had sneak attack, and although the Animal Copmpanion can get strong, specially with the special animal companion bluffs, I've had an Animal Companion with a level 38 druid, and it dies very quickly, the most usefulness in the Animal Companion I've got was a weird "bug" with the brnach of giving, which made the extra 1d10 fire or cold damage trespass every immunity.

You probably mean divine wrath, right? In that case nothing changes from 20th to 24th lvl so my suggestion to go Monk 3/Druid 15/ CoT 22 costs you only +1 to saves. The 8th lvl spell slots you'd get can be used to memorize extended (therefore longer lasting) aura of vitality a very useful buffing spell. By the way, Divine Wrath it's 1/day for five rounds only, dunno how helpful it is. Smite evil is also usable only 1/day.<br><br>Epic CoT gives you one more feat only, the real thing is the save boni. Be careful though those boni count towards the +20 cap (and you already hit +12 with CoT only).<br><br>My feat advices are the same as in the previous post (expertise/IE, disarm/ID instead of WF and maximize, zen archery's worth considering too).<br><br>IMO druids are quite survivable, so that a heavy druid build will fare good. Tattoed Monk made a good build <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "228407", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>here</a>, lvl split can be slightly different (I'd go for druid 25/Monk 7/CoT 8 for example for undispellable buffs). Or as I said, Druid 28/ CoT 10/ Monk 2. Considering the limited uses per day you have for your special CoT powers and the points you take away from WIS (and therefore from AC and possibly ranged AB with zen archery) it's a good alternative. The only real loss would be lower saves. But they will still be above 30 unshifted and above 40 shifted (consider that by dropping CHA you can put points in starting CON/DEX for save boost unshifted and shifted shape will actually benefit from higher WIS). The more I think about it the better it looks, but maybe it's just me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Animal companion might be kinda weak, but with the right buffs it gets decent. <br><br>It's all a matter of taste anyhow, so go with what suits you best.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

My version of the build relies on disarm + improved disarm, waits till the late epics to bother with monk and then only one level, uses the wasted epic bonus feats for great charisma to boost divine wrath's duration, which gets another 2 ab and divine damage at level 25. It's really difficult to resist a disarm from an huge unarmed dragon with a 70 ab. By no means a superior build, as his free deflect arrows feat is compromised.

Yes, divine wrath, hey, it can be casted while shapeshifted, even though it will last 5 rounds it gives +9 AB and damage, which I think is a great boost over the dragon shapeshift, would work fine for one fight (me thinking in PvP). 3 smites per day, it has Extra Smiting.<br><br>A but a Monk 3 / Druid 17 / Champion of Torm 20 would get druid spells level 9, wouldn't that be better? a Monk 1 / Druid 14 / Champion of Torm 25 would have the divine might increased to +10...... but I don't think it's worth that far.<br><br>Ok, shamely to say, I don't really know what Disarm is good for.....

Winning an opposed disarm roll playing an unarmed monk automaticly snatches (places the enemy weapon) in your inventory. The this gives you power to bargain with unruly devcritters as they cannot possibly harm you without their precious tool. I am also working on a parry using version of this build, as the dragonform dex is pretty high. With skillfocus parry, improved parry, epic skillfocus parry and a sold dex buff, his multiple attacks can easily deflect and counterattack one opponent all day long at his highest (monk) attack rate.

Disarm sounds good, but I wouldn't worry much for dev crit, I mean, I bluff myself with Extended Death Ward, I thought that makes me immune to instant death anyway.

We tested parry to death and found it quite viable on Athas Reborn. Do you only get 3 parry attempts with a non-warrior class? You should only get as many parries as you have attacks per round. Given this build has 6 attacks without a flurry, it's really not a problem.

By "it" do you mean low AB was your problem or that parry is restricted to 3 attacks per round?

As Finn says, parry attempts are limited to 3 per round, specifically you can try to parry only the first attack in each flurry. Even more, each riposte counts towards your 3 maximum parry attempts; therefore if you parry the first attack in the first flurry and you get a riposte you are left with only one parry attempt. When you have many attacks per round you are generally better off by going offensive and landing as many hits as possible or if you wanna go defensive use expertise/IE. If you face an opponent with many attacks per round, parry is not a wise choice cause you'll be blocking <b>at most</b> 3 of their attacks or even less if you get a riposte. Again, you are better off going offensive or exp/IE mode, generally speaking (or knock 'em down).<br><br>If parry were implemented the way it was advertised then it would be a much more viable choice. The way it works makes it quite unviable IMO.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail

If I ever thought of parrying (which wasn't really the case), now I won't even think about it, you guys just made me know I was right of not using it. But you got too exceeded, nobody seems to remember the build at this point.

Sorry for the double post, but there's a tecnical stuff I need to know, and this is the place to ask it, since it's for the new version of my dragon.<br><br>Since I'm going to use Monk at level 1 in my new split, I don't gain KD and IKD, I can easily get them on feats, the thing is, IKD gives a bonus to size when trying to knock the enemy, but does it still adds a size bonus after already being a dragon? because if not, I shouldn't get IKD, or it would be a waste of a feat, and the more feats I can get the better, since I'll try to get Improved Disarm and need some to spare, it works great in a dragon. I didn't think about it last time, because CoT got me more feats than what I needed, and I realized I have no idea if IKD works better than KD after already being a dragon.<br><br>I'm going for a Monk 1 / Druid 14 / Assassin 25 split if you were asking yourself what stupid stuff I'm trying.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/26/06 03:40</span></i></p>
