Thanks for the information Kail. I know that the kamas would be the smarter choice...I just wanted to make a build that used the two-bladed sword. So, yes, to maximize the build using the kamas would be a better choice. Is there a better class combination for using the two-bladed sword? Also, thank you for the links. I've got some reading to do!

I re-worked this build using some suggestions from Kail. I think it is a lot better this way. Still no kamas...I enjoy using the 2-bladed sword. You could easily go that route though. Something I meant to ask when Kail first replied to this build...is a naked AC of 23 really that bad for a non-dexer?<br><br>Fighter 12/ Monk 9/ Weapon Master 19<br><br>Human<br><br>STR	16 (32)		<br>DEX	15	<br>CON	14		<br>WIS	8	<br>INT	14				<br>CHA	8               <br><br>*All Stat Raises go to STR*<br><br>Max HP	502<br>BAB	29<br>w/2-bladed sword	46/41/36/31 (1-8+17)<br>Off Hand		46/41 (1-8+11)<br>			(15-20/x3)<br>AC (Naked) 23<br><br>Saves<br><br>Fort	25 (29)<br>Reflex	24 (28) (Improved Evasion)<br>Will	22 (26) (+2 vs Mind Affecting Spells)<br><br>Skills (207 total)	<br><br>Concentration	43	<br>Discipline	43	<br>Listen		41	<br>Tumble		40<br>Spellcraft	18<br>Intimidate	4 (for WM)<br>Points Left	18<br>    <br>1.

What are you using the monk levels for?  You're not using kamas, so no -3 BAB progression.  Wearing full plate gives you 19 AC + 8 for tumble, or 27 AC rather than your 23 AC.  Monk speed?  Is that really worth the lost special abilities from other classes?

Monk gives cleave, knockdown and improved knockdown, improved evasion...all for free. As well as being able to put points in to tumble all through out the build. Also, I should have mentioned that this my attempt to create a "samurai" type warrior. A naked AC of 23 with dex of 15 and regular plate would give an AC of 29, right? With magical plate and other items of protection, I think his AC should be just fine. Especially considering this is mainly a PvM build.<br>_________________<br>"This is where we fight!

29 is correct. But you don't get armor skin until lvl 39 though, and should perhaps take it earlier.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 03/06/06 18:56:45 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br>Trollborn Asgardian by the master of the Norse legends, Grimnir himself!<br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

I can't help but feel so many special abilities of the monk are just wasted.  Monk just doesn't seem to give you much in this build, rogue seems more efficient, but I suppose that's another build in general.  Still, I'd think something like Rogue 10/ Fighter 14 / Weapon Master 16 would be better.

I think I concur with the Monk levels. Rogue would give Sneaks, Uncanny Dodge, skill points/skills, and the possibility of Crippling Strike, but there isn't much to lose in the way of a DEX bonus from being flat-footed, and Monk gives Cleave and IKD for free, saving four feats. I think that is a lot in any build, and especially a WM build.

Why not lower dex to 14, and bump wisdom to 10?  If you were able to max Dex, and get decent wisdom gear, you'd end up with more AC then in full plate, and you get the monk speed <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>But, I would try lowering starting STR to 14 and setting wisdom to 14 as well, so it would look like 14,14,14,14, 8 charisma.
