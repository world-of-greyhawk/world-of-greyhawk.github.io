Contest?<br><br>What do we win?  OH, yeah.. NOTHING!   THere are several dwarven clerics made, look one up.<br><br>I am wondering about the laziness of the epic builders forum when we start to see posts like this from people too lazy to search the build page.<br><br>Come on people, use your own time and search.<br><br>Peace

That being said, I found the following CL/WM or CL/DwD builds (taken out the ones that have less than 4 levels in one class, no monks):<br><br>The Miserable Devastating Dwarf /Cleric 15/Fighter 6/WM 19<br>Divine Weaponmaster /Fighter 12/Cleric 15/WM 13<br>Divine Wall /Cleric 11DwD 22/WM 7<br>The Blade Apostle /Cleric 21/Fighter 12/WM 7<br>Hannibal /Fighter 6/Cleric 15/WM 19<br>Divine Kukri /Cleric 17/Fighter 16/WM 7<br>Bone Breaker /Cleric 20/Fighter 4/WM 16<br>The Dwarven Clanfather /Cleric 10/DwD22 /Fighter 8<br>Divine Defender /Cleric 12/DwD 22/Fighter 6<br>Divine Wall /Cleric 11DwD 22/WM 7<br>Dwarven Warpriest /Cleric 14/CoT 4/DwD 22<br>Dwarven Retaliation (Fighter 6/Cleric 12/DwD 22)<br>Clangeddin's Blade /Cleric 12/Fighter 10/DwD 18<br><br>Which one would be your favorite?<br><br>I also thought it would be 'dwarvish' to wield a warhammer .  GOing 13 levels in WM allows you an extra Wpn of choice no?  Could one do a dual wielding variety?

OK, I'm leaning on a Cleric / WM build.<br><br>I tried a dual wielding WarHammer / Light Hammer, and he looks cool.  I know it probably would make more sense if he used a HandAxe as a light weapon, but darn it if I don't just leave him with a light hammer it's so nice.<br><br>CL17/CT10/WM13 : <br><br>Warhammer: 37/32/27/22 17-20x4<br>L.Hammer: 37/32 17-20x3<br>(Both Hammers include WF and EWF)<br>Ending STR 25<br>Access to Spells Level 9.<br><br>I tried also building a CL15/CT10/WM15, but I only managed to increase the AB by 1, and I lose Spells Level 9...<br><br>Both of these builds are strenght based, but I lack the feats to get Cleave / Great Cleave in order to Get Overwhelming Crit which would have been nice.<br><br>The other alternative I was thinking about was going dex route, and Perhaps being able to get Epic Dodge...
