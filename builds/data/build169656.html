<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>Here's a build I worked up today. I didn't see one like this in the listing.<br><br>This guy gets two epic spells, devastating crit, a 16th level epic vrock to draw attacks and to create openings for the Undead Fiend to sneak attack (+5d6). In addition, he has improved knockdown to create his own sneak attacks as well as Epic Skill Focus in Taunt - his skill check is close to 50. With his bard levels he gets a level 8 Bard Song and max. Tumble and Use Magic Device.<br><br>His naked AC is 30, hit points (as I rolled them) were 382. He gets 4 attacks per round and with a mundane bastard sword his AB is 37/32/27/22<br><br>Please advise on improvements.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban<br><br><br>Undead Fiend  Bard 8/Palemaster 16/Blackguard 16  <br>Race: Human, Alignment: Evil  <br><br>Stats<br>Str 16 (26)<br>Dex 10  <br>Con 14  <br>Int 14  <br>Wis 8  <br>Cha 14  <br><br><br>1 Bard 1  Power Attack, Cleave<br>2 Bard 2  <br>3 Bard 3  Wpn Prof: Exotic<br>4 Bard 4  <br>5 Bard 5  <br>6 Bard 6  Wpn Focus: Bastard Sword<br>7 Bard 7  <br>8 PM 1  <br>9 PM 2  Great Cleave<br>10 BG 1  <br>11 BG 2  <br>12 BG 3  Knockdown<br>13 BG 4  <br>14 BG 5  <br>15 BG 6  Imp.

How about switching his weapon to scimitar? I think that losing 0-4 points of damage is worth having better critical chance, also he'd have one free feat more.

T_t,<br><br>Thanks for the scimitar suggestion. Looking at the build a day later, that's probably a change I'd make too. <br><br>Kaliban

Hi. I like this combination of classes.  Here is my take on a bard/blackguard/pale master.  I'm focusing more on bard to improve his ab and versitility though spellcasting and singing.  Blackguard is used to obtain the divine might feat to increase his damage output.<br><br>human, chaotic evil<br><br>bard 20/bg 4/pm 16<br><br>str 16<br>dex 8<br>con 14<br>wis 8<br>int 12<br>cha 16<br><br>1. bard: power attack, cleave<br>2. bard<br>3. bard: curse song<br>4. bard: +str<br>5. bard<br>6. bard: still spell<br>7. bard<br>8. bard: +str<br>9. blackguard: weapon focus (scimitar)<br>10. blackguard<br>11. blackguard<br>12. blackguard: divine might, +str<br>13. bard<br>14. bard<br>15. bard: improved critical (scimitar)<br>16. bard: +str<br>17. bard<br>18. bard: blind-fight<br>19. bard<br>20. bard: +str<br>21. palemaster: epic weapon focus (scimitar)<br>22. palemaster<br>23. palemaster<br>24. palemaster: epic prowess, +str<br>25. palemaster<br>26. palemaster<br>27. palemaster: great str 1<br>28. palemaster: +str<br>29. palemaster<br>30. palemaster: great str 2<br>31. palemaster<br>32. palemaster: +str<br>33. palemaster: great str 3, epic energy resist (sonic)<br>34. palemaster<br>35. palemaster<br>36. bard: great str 4, +str<br>37. bard<br>38. bard<br>39. bard: lasting inspiration<br>40. palemaster: epic mage armor, +str<br><br>final stats<br>str 30<br>dex 8<br>con 14<br>wis 8<br>int 12<br>cha 16<br><br>skills:<br>29 heal<br>5 hide<br>42 perform<br>43 spellcraft<br>42 taunt<br>40 tumble<br>17 umd<br><br>ac<br>10 base<br>10 palemaster<br>8 fullplate<br>3 tower sheild<br>-1 dex<br>8 tumble<br>5 armor (epic mage armor)<br>5 deflection (epic mage armor)<br>5 natural (epic mage armor)<br>5 dodge (epic mage armor)<br>1 dodge (mage armor)<br>4 haste<br>5 bardsong<br>-------------<br>68<br><br>ab<br>26 base<br>12 str (34 str with bg bull's and bard bull's)<br>5 greater magic weapon<br>2 war cry<br>2 bard song<br>5 curse song<br>6 taunt<br>------------<br>58 (normally 50, since taunt may not work and war cry wears off and has limited castings)<br><br>you may want to swap two of the great str feats for more combat related feats (knockdown, called-shot, etc...). I was going for max ab with this build.

Looks a lot like my 'Bad to the Bone' build but STR based instead of CHA.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Yes. I looked to undead fiend and bad to the bone for inspiration.  I like the number of bonus feats that the bad to the bone build gets from going epic palemaster and blackguard.<br><br>Unfortunately, with high cha and low str, the build's ab won't be high enough to hit the high level monsters on the world that I play on.  I don't like to swing and miss while my divine might buff is running out.  I used bard levels to add to AB as well as boosting strength.  bard has eagle's spendour, so with that and some +cha equipment my build can reach a +9 cha modifier.  Not as cool as the +14 your build gets, but my build will land hits where your build might not.
