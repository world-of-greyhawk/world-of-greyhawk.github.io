"What do you mean 'Who am I talking about?'" Verar's hushed tones were growing in volume with each word. The panic in his voice adding a shrill of it's own. "It's HIM. And they've sent him to get you, you really should lay low. The Deathsong Mariachi is bad news my friend..."<br><br>Matith gave his usual sneer. "That bloke? He's just a fairy tale, a myth. The boogeyman for us back-alley merchants and general scum. What's that they say he does? Sings to you right before 'e kills you? Good chance to run if you ask me..." He returned to his coin-purse, "And now you've made me lose count!" He dropped the remainder of coins back in and tightened the drawstring with a smirk. "Ah, no worries, me 'ole chum. Even if he was real, why would anyone send HIM to take out a common thief like me?"<br><br>Verar took a worried glance at the friend he considered brother. His voice had returned to a surprising calm. "That girl you took the other night was not so common.. they're saying that the servants of the house spotted you as you...er.. Invaded her skirts. It was a big house; you should have just taken the loot and gotten out of there. But no, you had to spite him, and for what?"<br><br>"The man spat at me!" Matith burst out. "All I did was look at her and he spits at me! Tells me I'd not ever 'ave the chance with his precious daughter. Well I showed 'im didn't I? Not such a virgin now is she?" He gave Verar a playful nudge in the ribs, but it did not placate the anxiety painted on his face.<br><br>"All I'm asking is for you to lay low for a while, until things blow over. You can hide out in our cellar."<br><br>"Awright, awright." Matith cut in quickly with a dismissive wave of his hand. "I just have a few things to do, a few things to pack and I'll be at your house shortly, ok?" Verar stared at him in response, Matith rolled his eyes. "It's not another score, don't worry, I'll be quick as silver." He gave a silver-toothed grin.<br><br>Verar looked at him a while longer before lowering his head and finally relaxing. "Ok... I'll see you there soon." Matith turned to go. "You'll be quick!" Verar called after him as he left.<br><br>"As silver!"<br><br>-----<br><br>It was pitch black by now. The only light that guided Matith's way was the occasional torch bracket that clung to every other house. Everyone was asleep, everything was quiet.<br><br>He laughed at the irony; it was after all the perfect chance for an assassin to strike. He grinned cheekily, "And what song would you sing to me?" he called out into the night.<br><br>His surroundings dimmed even darker, he could barely see inches from his face. He knew that the torches were still there, as he could hear the flames crackling upon the pitch. But he couldn't even see a slight shimmer of them.<br><br>The downward strum of an accoustic guitar cut through the cold air. A voice spoke through the emptiness, it's accent unusual, husky - possibly from somewhere south. "Slave to the Coin. Your death's lullaby." The sound of tapping on hollow wood followed.<br><br>Matith did not stop to ask questions. He ran. A whistle through the air chased him down and penetrated his calf. He called out in pain as he lost a step and tumbled to the hard dirt ground.<br><br>The voice sung, the guitar strummed.<br><br><i>"He never thought twice<br>He took from young and from old<br>Had a composure like ice<br>And a penchant for gold"</i><br><br>Matith ripped out the dart embeded in his calf and got to his feet. The music kept playing, a haunting trill of bittersweet notes. He limped as fast as he could. Another whistle through the air brought him to the ground once again.<br><br>The song played on.<br><br><i>"His takings went on<br>No end to his plunder<br>But soon after dawn<br>He'll be six feet under.</i><br><br>And why?" The voice asked during a pause in the song.<br><br>"Stop it!" Matith screamed out in a trembling voice, he tore the other dart out and threw it in a random direction. He could feel his blood escaping his body. He was cold, weak and drowsy. But he had to get away - he began crawling through the empty abyss. Tears stung his eyes and dampened his face. "Leave me alone!"<br><br>The music returned, but it had taken on a different tone. Intensified by some emotion, louder, faster – closer.<br><br><i>”He took that girl<br>He raped and he bruised her-“</i><br><br>Another whistle sliced through the air, followed by a short cry of pain.<br><br><i>”He got under her skin<br>The bastard abused her”</i><br><br>Another and another. No pause in the music.<br><br><i>”He’s a slave to the coin<br>And he sated his loins”</i><br><br>The music notably slowed down, the pauses between strums drawing out longer.<br><br><i>”Now there’s nothing else to do<br>The devil’s come for you.”</i><br><br>Matith got up on his knees, blood seeping from gaping wounds, tears streaming from sobbing eyes. “Please!” He pleaded. “I won’t do it again. I’ll change my ways!” Someone was behind him, but how did that blade get to his neck so quickly?<br><br>“There are consequences for what you do.” The song had reached its extro. His voice was right by his ear, almost soothing. “The devil’s come for you.”<br><br>The song ended.<br><br>***********************************<br><br>Revisions revisions.

Charisma items will increase the number of spells you can cast per day. Haste items (eg. Boots of Speed) will give you a good AC boost. Clothing would be preferable but Light Armour is ok if you really must, just note the Arcane Spell Failure that goes with it. You can take UMD instead of Heal and use Monk Robes, which work quite well. He’s mainly a Dual Wielder with daggers but if you find that you’re not hitting then take out the offhand dagger for q uick +2 to AB. If your server has it, get your hands on some Keen daggers for a nifty 15-20 crit range.<br><br>Well I think that’s everything. Big thanks to everyone who helped with the fine tuning (I love this community), I took all your advice into consideration while revising this build. Now for those who haven’t already read it, please enjoy the epilogue.<br><br>***********************************<br><br><b>Article from the "Harbinger" the next day</b><br><br><i>MURDER IN THE NIGHT!<br><br>Earlier this morning Town Guard Evorn Shae found the body of local townsman Matith Strumn. Repeated puncture wounds were found all over the body including a deep laceration on the neck which is assumedly the final death blow. The body was completely cold when found suggesting the murder took place in the late hours of the night.<br><br>According the Head Guard Orval Kercius, the murder had occured during a shift change in the guard's patrol routes. "It definately was a professional job - messy, but professional. The man knew what he was doing." Stated Kercius on the circumstances of Strumn's death. "We have no suspects yet, but the case is being worked on as we speak."<br><br>Matith Strumn, 28 - was a renowned thief though he was never caught for lack of evidence. "A rotten man he was." States a neighbor, "Couldn't hold a job for the life of him!". Strumn made many enemies in his life so it is a wonder if Town Officials will continue the investigation for very much longer.<br><br>One thing remains certain. There's no love lost for the death of a thief.<br><br>Annabrae Sheroni"</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/12/07 15:09</span></i></p>
