I have an Idea of a build and was already thinking of a way to make it, but I wanted someone else's perspective.<br><br>Has to be Half-Orc, and have some Intell. Though I don't care if it is a Ranger or Assassin, but they will be playing an assassin in a Assassin's guild on a PW server.  I need this to be a pretty baaaaddd build, b/c she's going to be hunted alot.  That is why I wanted people who know what they are talking about <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> ...<br>_________________<br>~Blake~

I guess shifter isn't bad if you want to play as an "assassin". There are several forms that fit the badass role. <br>What you choose as 3rd class depends on what class feats etc you want to add to the build. I don't think ranger is the class that has most to offer there. <br>When you play a shifter it's important to get to know the different forms. If you haven't already, you should read a detailed shifter guide. Then decide what to go for.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 02/23/05 13:24</span></i></p>
