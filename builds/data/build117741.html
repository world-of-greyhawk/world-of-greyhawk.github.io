Ok here goes my crack at a build. First off though, I still think the best class to go against the mage builds is either another mage build or almost pure cleric. 22 levels of cleric with 18 level of monk. Starting as a human with intelligence of 12 you can max out tumble and discipline with monk taken at level 40 pls get cleave and evasion. This gives a spell resistance of 51% and you can use greater sanct. unitl epic warding wears off. One question, can a cleric turn the demilich?<br>Onto my all around good build. lets call him/her the disciplined divine warrior.<br>Start out as human<br>str - 14<br>dex - 14<br>con - 15 (+1 level progression) 16<br>int - 10<br>wis - 16 (+9 level progression and +1 feat) - 26<br>cha - 8 (you might want to lower dex to 10 and increase this to 12 depending on what mod you play)<br>Skill- max out discipline, concentration, tumble and spell craft when skills are class skills.<br>Level 1 (Monk)- Free feats - Cleave, evasion, flurry of blows, improved unarmed strike, Monk AC bonus, quick to master, stunning fist, weap prof monk.<br>Also take luck of heros and dodge<br>level 2 (monk) free feat - deflect arrows<br>level 3 (monk)- feat mobility (although I would probably take something else. i dont think this feat is all that great)<br>level 4 (monk) +1 stat to con<br>level 5 (monk) still mind and monk speed (free)<br>Level 6 (monk) purity of body, improved knockdown (free)<br>take weapon prof martial (i took this for the long bow)<br>level 7 (monk) wholeness of body (free)<br>level 8 (monk) +1 stat to wis<br>level 9 (monk) improved evasion (free), zen archery<br>Level 10 (monk) ki strike +1 (free)<br>level 11 (monk) diamond body (free)<br>level 12 (monk) diamond soul (free) weapon focus kama +1 stat to wis<br>level 13 (monk) ki strike +2 (free)<br>level 14 (monk)<br>level 15 (monk) toughness<br>level 16 (monk) +1 stat to wisdom<br>level 17 (cleric) I recommend the magic and healing domains<br>level 18 (cleric) combat casting<br>level 19 (cleric)<br>level 20 (cleric) +1 stat to wis<br>level 21 (monk) epic weap focus kama<br>level 22 (monk) 50% concealment (forget the feat name)<br>the next 16 levels are all cleric with feats taken in this order<br>spell focus evocation<br>greater spell focus evocation<br>epic spell focus evocation (this gives one really good school of magic including firestorm, blade barrier and implosion. When I cast implosion, it had a dc of 40. Is this right? I didn't think all the spell focus' stacked but it apears that it did.)<br>improved combat casting<br>epic reflex<br>Ending BAB was +30/+27/+24/+21/+18 (not sure how I got 5 attacks but I assume it is a bug)<br>Saves<br>Fort - 27 (I thought about swapping out a feat to imrove this to have a better chance against dev. crit).<br>reflex - 28<br>will - 33<br>naked ac of 32<br>with all the cleric attack buffs i got the bab bonus up to +50<br>it is important to take the levels in the order listed to max out skills, saves, and base attack. The drawback to this build is no epic spells. The benefits - with 50% concealment, you have a much less chance of getting hit with dev. crit from a fighter and in one round you can cast harm and melfs acid arrow and take them out. Against mages you have a 30 spell resist and greater sanct can protect you until epic warding wears off. not as good as a pure cleric but great hit points to survive IGM until you can get a heal off. Great defense buffs from the cleric and you also get dispel magic which could help against the mage. Please contribute any pointers.<br>Chris<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Anuis on 08/19/04 22:05</span></i></p>
