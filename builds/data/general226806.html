I'm looking at doing a Barb with Mighty rage and as i need the con at 22 i was going to go for Epic DR as well. I was just wondering is it worth it as i did hear that the Epic DR feats do not stack with the Barb DR. Not sure if it's been sloved since i was told or not. <br><br>just wondering if anyone knows if thats is true or not?<br><br>thanks<br>bgw

My understanding is that the Epic DR feat does indeed stack with Barbarian DR, as well as with any sorts of items that grant DR of x/-<br>_________________<br>Never argue with an idiot.  They will drag you down to their level, then beat you with experience.

Barbarian, dwarven defender and epic feat DRs do stack
