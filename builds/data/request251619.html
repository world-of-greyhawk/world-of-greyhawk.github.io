Hello,<br><br>I played NWN for a while on a PW but was disheartened when I got to higher lvls and realized I severely ganked my build.<br><br>If someone could post a sweet build for a Halfling Rogue type with SD HIPS ability, he will use two weapons, short swords. I am looking for awesome backstabbing, stealth, lock picking and goog dmg. I am not good at all at making builds. It is okay to add another class say fighter, Weapon Master, assassin, If you could put stat selection recommendations, skill selection by lvl and what feats to pick at each lvl I would appreciatte it. The build can go up to 40 but am only worried about first 20 lvls. Any help or advice be appreciatted.<br><br>Night

Check the builds I posted <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "13568", "23448", "243033", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>here</a> and make them halfling. Drop one feat (Called Shot?) and move some feats up. Remember that halfling are small size, there fore you are better off dualwielding kukris or daggers instead of shortswords, which have an additional -2 penalty to dual wield.<br><br><br>Check the guild linked in my sig for lvl 20 or 30 capped builds.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>You like to discuss character builds but not necessarily want to take them all the way to 40th street?

The 4 SD is for 2 reasons: get 16 BAB, and avoid the cheesy 1 SD level (some servers have rules against that). If you want to take just 1 SD level, then go Rogue 11/Fighter 8/SD 1 as Kail suggested. That way does gain you some bonus feats, but costs you some skill points and a few extra SD abilities (Shadow Daze and Summon Shadow). Going for 13 Rogue does gain you the Rogue bonus feat, but costs you the 4th attack.<br><br>TM

What use is the 4th attack? People always say that you don't need a high crit range since you won't hit on those lower rolls anyway. Then what is the point of an extra attack at -15? Nothing. With haste item you will still have two attacks in the first flurry. Better to use your UMD with Divine Power scrolls when needed then.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

I always figure the 4th attack isn't absolutely necessary, but I try to get it if it won't seriously harm the build concept. The reasons to go for the 4th attack (with an eye to this particular build request is):<br><br>1) A dual-wielder will get 3 attacks in the first flurry if Hasted, which could mean a lot more sneak damage.<br><br>2) It's another chance to roll a 20 for an autohit, and that's never a bad thing.<br><br>3) A secondary effect is your BAB is at least 1 higher than it would be if you <i>didn't</i> get the 4th attack, which means your AB is 1 higher than it would be, which means a slightly better chance for all attacks hitting.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

1 extra rogue feat and the possibility to use Divine power scrolls when in peril beats all those points quite good. But I agree, if it gives you more attacks in the first flurry it is probably worth it.

Yeah, it's totally preference. My experience has been Divine Power scrolls are not all that common, and even if you do get them, the caster level is so low (7 rounds) as to make them tenuous options at best.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

For sneak attack builds, the key thing is to get the extra attacks in the first flurry. 4 per round means 2 in the first flurry unhasted and single-wielding, and 3 if hasted and dual-wielding (as Cinn pointed out already). With only 3, you only get 1 unhasted, and a max of 2. <br><br>Also, since most sneakers will make the first attack an IKD attempt, if the IKD succeeds then your odds of landing all the rest goes up (they lose -4 AC for being prone, and all dodge AC, which can be considerable), so you often land all the attacks after a successful IKD, all doing sneak damage.<br><br>It's not absolutely critical to get the 4th attack, and if you are going to get something really useful to the build in exchange then go for it. But the build isn't feat-starved as is, so I would keep the extra attack. <br><br>TM
