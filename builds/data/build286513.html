Go Bard 4 pre-epic or delay al the Bard levels till epic, to net you some more AB (1?).<br><br>You don't need so many skill points in Perform with 15 Bard levels, so put some of them in Tumble to reach 40 and in UMD so as to get a multiple of 5. Also, Concentration is not that useful in this build, so I would change it for Spellcraft, or maybe Taunt.<br><br>You probably didn't want it, but just to note it: there's no Still Spell, so you will have to drop the armor for buffing.<br><br>You ended with 25 STR, which will do you no good unbuffed, so try to get it to an even number.<br><br>You may want to improve the formatting, but that's just me.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By rafa10pj on 11/09/07 00:33</span></i></p>

Take bard as final skill dump<br>2. Drop Concentration for Spellcraft for the saves.<br>3. Get Tumble to 40 base.<br>4. Keep bard song at 24 total (base + modifiers). Your bard song won't get any better with more ranks.<br>5. Think about taking Hide and Move silently, or if you can adjust some feats, maybe improved and superior initiative. You have lowish HP and Fort Saves and not wearing a shield. That goes to say you always need to be the first to strike in combat.<br><br>As for the AB issue, like rafa10pj said, take all bard levels at epic levels for max BAB, but personally, I'd take all bard levels pre-epic for playability purposes. Plus, those bard buffs and spells are a greater boon on early levels than it is at epic levels.

Remember to check the build search engine for similar builds. There are several that use this class split, including a few by TyrTemplar that use the exact same level distribution. Looking over her builds real quick, the only difference I noticed is that your build uses kukris and her the longsword I believe. They like to have good reasons to list similar builds here, meaning that your build usually will need to aim to do something differently or maybe even better than what was first attempted.<br><br>*edit* <br><br>Ofcourse, your build is a dual wielder as well so that may be enough of a reason to post. I didnt check all the other builds though. Just a reminder to check similar builds and post links to those builds, atleast the ones that closely resemble your own.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By galelabriel on 11/09/07 03:04</span></i></p>

I know that the intention of the build was other, but dropping Dev Crit would free up 5 feats, which this build desperately needs. <br>Mind you, going for a dual-wielder, dev critter Weapon Master requires 14 feats (12 I'd say, because you may want to keep Expertise and should keep Weapon Focus), which is a lot. Toughness could be taken to aid in the HP department, as well as more Great Strength feats to increase AB and Armor Skin to increase AC.<br>Furthermore, if you decide to single wield, you can drop DEX to 10 and have more breathing space as far as ability points go, namely STR and CON.<br><br>I'm sorry if this feels like I'm hijacking your build and thread, but it seems to me that you are stretching your character too thin.<br>But then again, I know nothing <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>As far as formatting goes, I suggest <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Other.Detail&amp;id=856" target="_blank">Kamyrin's Character Build Calculator</a>, in which you can plan your builds and then use the output to post here in an orderly manner (you will have to paste the output in a word processor and then from there in your thread).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By rafa10pj on 11/09/07 04:49</span></i></p>

Man, writing "none" on the emply feat levels is only difficulting it to read.<br><br>Base HP calculation is made at max rolls, a rolled value is useless as it won't reflect your potential. Quick calculation and I think it should be 380.<br><br>I'd probably drop Two Weapon Fighting altogether, I know you want a lot of hits with a lot of dev crits, but your AB suffers it and your feats too, a wide critical range is useless without an AB that can support it, +41 is not good enough. dropping TWF means drop DEX to 13 for more STR and get Cleve and Great Cleave pre-epic, and take Great Strength in epics for more AB, aside from that, you wouldn't need kukris (drop Exotic proficiency) and could take scimitar one handed and a shield for more AC and same critical range. However, this is for more effective final stats, but the build would be completely changed and probably not viable as a new build choice <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif"><br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

I (we) know it is your first build, and that is always taken into consideration. <br><br>In my view (and other's as well), building is a matter of choosing, and if you don't choose one path or another you might end with a build that's stretched to thin. I think this was your problem, and not "NOOBISH" building as you said. There are not noob flaws I dare say, but that is situational I guess. You shouldn't be discouraged either way.<br><br>Anyways, there must exist builds which go for all you wanted to go for and still remain effective...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By rafa10pj on 11/10/07 00:28</span></i></p>

I doubt this was your "first ever" build playing nwn. Anyways, if you know your build has an inherent weakness. Every build has a weakness (as well as strengths). Write them down as well and if possible, also include how you can circumvent those weaknesses. Provide more details.<br><br>P.S. "first build" doesn't really justify readability issues <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Just my 2 cents

If this build is for PVP, AB is definitely hurting, but if not I think the AB is fine as it is.

Well, first off, the Bard 23 CoT 10 WM 7 is far and away a better version of this.  Don't get me wrong, fighters are fun, and who doesn't want an extra +6 damage per hit?  But... I'd trade that extra damager per hit for +5 to all my saves, lay on hands, and Divine Wrath any day.  Plus, if you  have to take some WM levels pre-epic, the save bonus from CoT helps to offset the loss to your Fortitude save.<br><br>Beyond that, I don't see the point in building a pvp bard that doesn't have lasting inspiration.  The ability to save your songs for cursing opponents helps temendously in pvp.  If you rebuild this, try to take at least 20 Bard levels so you can get it.<br><br>Also, the ability score allotment could use tweaking.  You really need to choose whether this is going to be a Dex-based or Str-based build.  If Dex, go halfling or elf.  Otherwise, human should be fine.<br><br>If you decide to stick with Str, you could quite feasibly lose some of that starting Dex to boost Str, and use a shield instead of dual wielding to make up for the lost AC.  With that nasty WM crit range, and a decent weapon, you needn't worry too much about a couple more attacks per round.  Doing that would free up at least a couple of feats, with which you could buy Extend Spell and/or Still Spell, for extended Displacements, War Cry, Ethereal Visage, et al.  Still would make it easier to cast Dispels, Wounding Whispers, Confusion et al during combat.<br><br>Finally, lose the dodge/mobility/spring attack line of feats.  Tumble will more than suffice for moving around in combat.  Consider taking Knockdown, Improved Knockdown, and a save enhancing feat (like great fortitude) instead.<br><br>Edit:  Also, if you decided to dual wield to increase your chances of Dev-critting someone, you should know (if you already don't) that Dev crit does not work with your offhand weapon.  So, no Dev crit rolls with those attacks.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Hiwatt on 11/13/07 01:18</span></i></p>

I just tested the dev.crit off-hand again, with one of dev.crit dual wielders (in this case, the Green Beret, dev.crit kama-wielding monk/ranger/cot, putting the kama into the off-hand (with the dev.crit feat thus off-hand), and a simple shortsword in the main, so as to test to see if there are any changes, and am happy to report that there are no changes such that me monk was dev.critting just fine (of course, works much much nicer when the dev.crit is coming at your enemy from both hands, and that's nice! -- so yeah, you can dev.crit from the off-hand, it does still  apply (game version: 1.68).<br><br>Ah, but a bard/wm/ftr -- yeah, I've a few of them (everyone knows here how much I *love* dem singing knights <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      And you'd be referring to my Hex Blade, one of my earliest offerings (my, my, how time flies, not a dual-wielder but at AB 42 (naked, au natural/unbuffed)didn't see the point of going that route, even for PvM (since, well, 42 w. dispellable bard buffs doesn't exactly make for a PvP threat, specially not by today's standards but then again, back then, well, yeah, had me some learnin' to do (did nicely in party-play, but meh, so much better with more WM added of course (see, i.e., Blade, WM 28/Bard 1/Fighter 11 which is lovely li'l human monster, with a the dev. (and designed especially) for those servers which allow dev.crit but aren't so keen on the RDDs (and that he holds a bit of a tune, well, a hum really at bard 1, still, me loves dem singing knights .... Of course, for dev.crit (DC) you want to focus on strength, which can be a problem in turn for bards, unless just used for skills/flavor (as was/is the case in Blade, at bard 1).<br><br>Of course, all of this was in fact discussed in me Hex (i.e., improvement options, weaknesses (which yes, you are supposed to point out to the extent you know them of course -- no one, least of all a 'singing knight' fan like me would ever (and I mean never) come down on anyone at all really, but especially not one who's learning, none of us would ever do, and that of course is the best part of this guild as we all love to build and learn, and share, and ... build! (trust me, you'll learn oodles here, it's what we're all about, and if you don't believe me, well, just check out the differences b.w me old Hex and the entire Blade series (from dev.crit hummer to mid-level bard-soldiers to the full-blown LI ally-buffing leader of the pack if you will, who holds his own in combat ... they're all in the pulse, though none are dual-wielders and are some templates you may wish to look at, if like me you really really really enjoy dem singing knights (did I mention that I like dem singing knights? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      <br><br>There are also a couple nice kukri masters out there which will likewise show you what more WM will get ya, ... now, me personally, I didn't (as noted) do a dual-wielder, and I kinda like the take on that (hey, get your AB up (i.e., more WM, at least 19 of it for AB (tis a beautiful thing, and then you can call it a "blade" if you like, and no worries about not linking to me old ones -- deal? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      (I say this in the spirit of welcome, and am not coming down on you, but you are not only supposed to link to all the others which came before you and explain how yours differs from that which has come before, as we are a collection if you will of info about classes, a bit of a library too, and hey, if a build or concept inspires a player to build something similar but different, to achieve something else (different enough to warrant a new post, and not just a tweak for a desired improvement but something different (otherwise, we tend to put the 'hey, and if you tweak it like this then you'll get that' else why bother sharing with the community in the first place, no? And that's how we all learn, and discuss, and flush stuff out; now, with the old ones it's a bit tricky since a lot has changed of course in the updates, etc., and of course styles over time change too such that what a builder did yester-year may not in fact be the same thing a builder would do today, so we here (always) encourage members to revisit the old ones if they so choose, keeps us all on our toes and the builds "fresh" -- plus, let's face it, always nice to see the old ones get attention, and how new members envirion it, especially great when they take it somewhere esle and/or a whole new perspective (aka, a new post, and hence sharing too) since everyone comes with a fresh persepective, great energy and tons of new ideas, thus adding a lot of good stuff to the guild always (once again, welcome, and nice to meet you!).<br><br>As to dual-wield, you really gotta get that up, and there's two ways of doing it -- more WM as stated above, or, conversely, since you're relying on the moment on dispellable buffs, bring your bard levels up (much much better song, curse is a wonderful thing don't forget, w. LI such that it in essence never runs out (100 rounds, heh, the battle was over eons ago and yet you're still singing about it, ya know? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      At 25 bard, your buffs become quite solid, in that they're not dispellable (barring nasty mords), so enjoy. While myself I've a few, if you *really* want a laster who focusses much more on being the maestro (aka, party-leader, w. the song extraordinaire, a musical fiend with the oh so inspirational songs, then check out Cinn's bards - mine are whistlers by comparison to his, since he squeezes absolutely every perform rank in his maestros' that he can, focussing thus on the beautiful bard song (heh, but I can't help it since, oh me gets to repeat myself (ever notice folks that I do that sometimes <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      --- yep, you know, me loves dem singing knights .... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     <br><br>As such, comes down to focus (from one singing knight lover to oh, I do see in you a singing knight fan, too: EXCELLENT!!! And again, WELCOME! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   - do you want the sword (in which case, more WM) or the song (in which case, more bard, 20 at least for the LI, 25 for non-dispellable buffs, and you'll want to check out (there are so many nice ones, but those by Cinn, I.Samphus, Leafbow among others come to mind, and lots thus then for you to have a looksy at, should you wish to go more for the song).<br><br>Yes, there's a sweet spot to be had if you're looking for more of a balance, as in, a solid melee'r (AB 45 au natural is the ticket), and 19 WM/mid-bard (sweet spot as we call it here), which is incredibly fun to play PvM and will cut-it as a team-member PvP; not an uber-dev.critter by any means, but a good knight who can sing and dance and slash on behalf of his/her party. Lots of those on the Pulse also, lots of good ones, as it truly is one of the most versatile combos out there, and hence some great info there to be had just by looking, right? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     <br><br>Ah, but if you're truly set on dual-wield, I am happy to report that there is one (by our very own Grizzled One, a very nice singing knight with dual and hence a good template also for you to look at).
