I have been looking around at alot of different classes for one that there isnt 30+ of on the server i play on and this setup would be a really rare one, if not the only one on there. The server i play on Requires 10 Sorc or Wiz for PM and PM must be takin before lvl 20 or 21 ( i think taking it as the 20th would be fine). I tried a few builds myself but they failed horribly lol. Id like it to be melee based and preferable 10 Sorc 10 RDD 20 PM. Id like to get the biggest AB and AC Possible out of it, if nessisary give a lil AC for AB. I play on a high magic world and you need atleast 52+ AB to be able to hit most things. We have +8 Weapons and +7 Armor. Id like Epic Mage Armor and Epic Warding in the build somewhere, Id prefer it be a Human or Half Elf. Rapier/Kukri would be the ideal weapon i guess for this build since they are easy to get and most powerful until late in game when you get a even more powerful one.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Seipherwood on 09/21/06 03:41</span></i></p>

Sorcerer/PM/RDD isn't a good melee build. Try instead Bard/PM/RDD either Bard 16/PM 14/RDD 10 (for EW and EMA) or Bard 20/PM 10/RDD 10 for LI, a stronger song and more bardic spells.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Unto to the darkness<br>I commend my soul<br>Never shall I repent<br>Never shall I be saved<br><br>I'll go into the House of Death<br>Before my last breath<br>My enemies all shall die!

Even better than I could ever imagine) 55 ab SUCKS!   I would be ashamed if I had a char with that gear and ONLY had 55 to show for it!  My god.  I counted 10 different types of damage PER hit!!  If you really want to make a char with this itm, make a bard/rdd/wm, make it elf.  The thing with this kind of magic is strengthers become less and less important.  See, on low magic worlds, we tend to need the str for damage.  THis one wpn, in the hands of a High dex elf!!  oh my.  *faints*<br><br>BTW, just for future note: ask and build for MUNDANE!  BUilding or requesting for a specific world or itm is poor form.  I am sure that your server has forums to post and those dudes know the itms and such so they  are more than capable of helpin you.

Just a short notice, of course he is free to ask for server-specific builds around here as long as he is aware that he probably won't get too accurate answers. We'll do our best though. A sorcerer/RDD/PM probably won't be the best melee build, I have to agree. And I have found that Fighter/Bard/WM often outshines Bard/RDD/WM's, just FYI.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

I agree with the others, this combo is not going to do well in melee.  <br><br>That being said, you could up your BAB by 1 if you took 10 Sorc / 8 RDD / 2 PM pre-epic.  This would net you a 22 BAB at level 40.

Sorc/Paladin/RDD is a possible charisma based melee build. You can get a spellsword in full plate and tower, with lvl 9 spells autostilled and 4 attacks/round.<br><br><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 09/26/06 13:58:26 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Oh, but <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "245889", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Bard/RDD/Paladin</a> is the best <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Almost the same build as my latest Bard/Blackguard/RDD.
