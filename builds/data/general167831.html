What's the most potential damage a class combo can inflict to the most types of monsters, assuming a 1 on every roll for variable damage? When I say potential, I'm discounting the possibility that the monsters may have some kind of damage reduction. I also say most types of monsters since enough properly chosen ranger Favored Enemies can assure a wide range of creatures, but rules out smites. I also don't mean Criticals or Sneaks.<br><br>I'd like to work backwards from there and build a character. It's likely that whatever that combo is, it's going to have a lot of weaknesses. I'm just trying to get a figure for how good the end resulting damage is relative to the most one can get.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By RichiP on 12/02/04 00:23</span></i></p>

I'd probably say something like bard/barbarian/rDD  Using two weapon fighting with a dire mace.<br><br>21 barbarian/9 bard/10 rDD  Gets your strength really high, high rage, some bonus from bard.

I was actually thinking "per hit". And you have to remember that damage can come from many things: weap spec, favored enemy, divine might, divine favor, str modifiers from spells, bard song, bardspells, etc.
