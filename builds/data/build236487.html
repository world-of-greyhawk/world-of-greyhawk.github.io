I created this build to take advantage of the new 1.67 Evard's Black Tentacles, which renders small creatures completely immune to the effects of the spell, and forces up to 18 d20+28 grapple checks against one creature when empowered.

This allows the gnome (or halfling, but I'd go halfling ES there) to run through fields of Evards as if they were summer wheat while opponents take <b>up to 160 points of damage ignoring spell resistance, mantles, and doing all the damage in one blow at the end of the script, which can blow past Epic Warding for 100 damage each.</b>  The focus in Conjuration is there to get the save DC vs the EBT paralysis as high as possible so opponents will take the damage again.  Multiple fields do overlap and cause damage seperately.  Against Dex/Concealment builds, or other high caster builds without a lot of STR/AB, there is no avoiding at least some damage because EBT works like a hand grenade (close enough is close enough).  Slapping the target with an empowered Negative Energy will reduce the target's ability to grapple by up to five.  Fun, huh?<br><br>It's a bit of a theme build with the epic skill foci and points in craft, so you could replace those with more Great Int if you want.  Or ramp up quicken/still spell and wear some chainmail (granted via Bard class).  Whatever.  However, this build can easily detect and disable PC laid traps, and set its own Epic Traps.  On servers where Find Traps is nerfed to just find, not reveal traps, he will come in handy.  He crafts and is good with disabling and using devices, hence the name "gnome mechanic".  Craft wand is there for flavor, but he can craft wands of Evard's Black Tentacles if desired (at level 15, so the grapple DC will be 23+d20 vs unmodified BAB + Modified STR).  The initial version used Wizard 35/Rogue 5 (with 4 rogue levels pre-epic and shortbow use), but seriously loses gnome flavor and discipline.  The pixie is there to help with the locks and traps between levels.  The epic spell focus: illusion creates a pretty neat 1.67 Mass Blindness/Deafeness DC, which now only affects enemies even on the hardest difficulty setting.

I like this build, very slick. Personally, I'd go with a bit more STR, but that's just my preference.

It's not overly dependent on DEX or CON, but I like the 18 starting INT (and taking the Great INT feats first) to maximize skill points.  It would do just fine with -2/+2 along those lines.<br>_________________<br>Vulcano's <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&amp;id=6522" target="_blank">Bard Studio</a> (in beta, 1.67).  *Updated*  Compose, play, and save your own bard music dynamically in game!

I was spacing out the epic levels a bit differently in testing (intending to go at 1, 17, 27, 32, and 37) and wanted to make sure I could max Tumble and UMD on whatever levels I wanted, which also provided for a more balanced experience from levels 1-40.  Also, under 3.5, Bard is the gnome's favored class, but that is just flavor.  Better off with fighter, and take Expertise and Improved Expertise (or focus: heavy xbow and Epic focus: heavy xbow if the server drops casters out of expertise mode).

If you really want to maximize the build, swap out Skill Focus: Disable Trap for Expertise at level 1 and take improved critical: heavy xbow on one of the fighter levels.  I left it in my build for flavor.  The only other appealing fighter feat is probably Epic Toughness, to get some (or all, if taken twice) of the hitpoints back from dropping CON.  You get access to the fighter's epic bonus feat list by taking both fighter levels in epic, but nothing that really helps the mechanic all that much.<br><br>One more thing:  If you are working with a party, carry around some lesser dispels/gust of wind.

Well, you could take Expertise instead of Still Spell, take Imp Expertise at the first fighter level, then take Armor Skin at the second one. Just 2 more AC...<br><br>The reason I don't care for Quicken spell is that even in a low-magic environment with no permahaste, he's a level 36 wizard. Extended haste will last him 72 rounds, long enough for him to toss it off well in advance of a fight and have it last through. With his Craft Wand skill, he can even make a wand of it so he doesn't have to waste spellslots (or even extended mass haste if he's in a party - they will really love him then).<br><br>TM
