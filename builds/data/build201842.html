<b>Playable from levels 1-40 (XP penalty though)... PvM</b><br><br>I present to you the ultimate dexterity based "ranger".  Note that there are no ranger levels, because you can't make a halfway decent ranger that's dexterity based.  Instead, I set out to make a character that can fill the role of dexterity based ranger.  what you end up with is a build that is a better scout, does more damage and has better spells.  I originally intended to use druid instead of cleric, but, without a wisdom focus, the cleric spells are far more useful that the druid spells and the lists overlap to some degree.  This build should do best in a no magic or low magic setting where devastating critical is banned.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-8D6 Sneak attack.  Coupled with improved invisibility, improved knockdown and word of faith, this build can get a large number of sneak attacks.<br>-Good Damage for a Dex Build.  With Bull's strength and Divine power he can increase his strength by 12 to add some bonus damage.  Darkfire, greater magic weapon, epic weapon specialization, divine favor, battletide and prayer also contribute to this build's damage potential.  Even without critical hits or sneak attacks, this build does well in the damage department.<br>-Level 8 Cleric spells.  I originally wanted to use druid spells, since ranger magic is supposed to be druidic, but the spell lists are similar and the melee buffs help out this build much more than the offensive druid spells ever could.<br>-Epic Dodge.  He can avoid the first attack from his opponent each turn.<br>-Improved Evasion and a good reflex save.  He doesn't take much damage from evocations.<br>-Can set traps.  He can use traps to augment his melee abilities<br>-Excellent scouting abilities.  He has a good hide and move silently skill, and with find traps, true sight, improved invisibility and greater sanctuary, he can scout as well as any ranger or rogue.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br><br>-Low Hitpoints.  This is a result of being an elf with rogue levels.  Not much can be done about this, but he does have endurance, heal, greater restoration and mass heal as well a good AC if he uses a shield.<br>-Low Caster Level.  He can be dispelled, though this will not affect his armor and weapon buffs, and he can have trouble with SR.<br>-Low AB.  He has a 40 AB with a single mace, 38 while dual wielding.  With cleric buffs, this should be fine for a low or no magic world, but it can be problematic.<br>-Mediocre Fortitude and Will saves.  He can cast clarity and death ward, and he has okay fortitude saves and will saves vs. spells but this is a weak point.<br>-XP penalty from level 15 onwards.<br><br><i>Comparison of this "Ranger" to a Ranger</i><br><br>-Spells.  I don't need to show the superiority of level 8 cleric spells to level 4 ranger spells<br>-Damage.  Favored enemy and Bane of Enemies does 9+2D6 points of damage to favored enemies.  With epic weapon specialization and darkfire alone he does 14+1D4 points of damage to all opponents.  Throw in the sneak attack and other cleric buffs and the "Ranger" wins hands down<br>-Attack Bonus.  The Ranger would have a 4 point higher AB than the "Ranger".  The Ranger can only use blade thirst and aid to buffs his AB, while the "Ranger" has bless, aid, divine power, divine favor, prayer, battletide and greater magic weapon to buff his AB. <br>-Hit Points.  The Ranger with the same CON would have 102 more hit points, The "Ranger" cam cast endurance to decrease that gap to 22, but the Ranger wins out here.<br>-Animal Companion.  The Ranger can summon a powerful animal, the "Ranger" can summon an elder elemental.<br>-Stealth.  The Ranger has high hide and move silently skills which he can augment with camoflage.  The "Ranger" has high hide and move silently skills, which he can augment with invisibility spells.<br>-Detection.  The Ranger has a high spot, listen and search skill.  The "Ranger" can cast true sight and find traps.<br>-Trap Setting.  Both builds can set traps.<br>-Defense.  The Ranger has a similar AC, but the "Ranger" has uncanny dodge, epic dodge and improved invisibility.<br><br><b>Ultimate Dex "Ranger"</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Elf<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Any<br><br><i>Base Attribute</i><br>STR 10<br>DEX 18<br>CON 12<br>WIS 14<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8 <br><br><i>Leveling Guide</i> (complicated, but you only get an XP penalty at level 15 and it doesn't get higher than 20%)<br>Level 1 Rogue<br>Level 2 Fighter<br>Level 3 Cleric<br>Level 4 Rogue<br>Level 5 Fighter<br>Level 6 Cleric<br>Level 7 Rogue<br>Level 8 Fighter<br>Level 9 Cleric<br>Level 10 Rogue<br>Level 11 Fighter<br>Level 12 Cleric<br>Level 13 Rogue<br>Level 14 Cleric<br>Level 15 Rogue<br>Level 16 Cleric<br>Level 17 Rogue<br>Level 18 Cleric<br>Level 19 Rogue<br>Level 20 Cleric<br>Level 21 Fighter<br>Level 22 Rogue<br>Level 23 Cleric<br>Level 24 Rogue<br>Level 25 Cleric<br>Level 26 Rogue<br>Level 27 Cleric<br>Level 28 Fighter<br>Level 29 Rogue<br>Level 30 Cleric<br>Level 31 Rogue<br>Level 32 Cleric<br>Level 33 Rogue<br>Level 34 Cleric<br>Level 35 Fighter<br>Level 36 Rogue<br>Level 37 Cleric<br>Level 38 Cleric<br>Level 39 Rogue<br>Level 40 Fighter<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Cleric 16<br>Fighter 8<br>Rogue 16<br><br><br><i>Clerical Domains</i><br>Trickery and Animal (Trickery and War are better choices though)<br><br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 28 and 40 go to dexterity<br>levels 20, 24, 32 and 36 go to wisdom<br><br><i>Feats</i><br>Level 1: Knockdown<br>Level 2: Weapon Finesse<br>Level 3: Weapon Focus (mace)<br>Level 5: Ambidexterity<br>Level 6: Two-Weapon fighting <br>Level 9: Improved Knockdown<br>Level 11: Weapon Specialization (mace)<br>Level 12: Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>Level 15: Blind-Fight<br>Level 18: Extend Spell<br>Level 21: Epic Weapon Focus (mace)<br>Level 24: Great Dexterity I, Improved Evasion<br>Level 27: Great Dexterity II<br>Level 28: Epic Weapon Specialization (mace)<br>Level 30: Great Dexterity III<br>Level 31: Defensive Roll<br>Level 33: Great Dexterity IV<br>Level 36: Great Dexterity V<br>Level 39: Great Dexterity VI, Epic Dodge<br>Level 40: Epic Prowess<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 10<br>DEX 30<br>CON 12<br>WIS 18<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>Final Saves (Vs.

A really cool and fun build. Nothing extraordinary about classes and levels, but the way you "made" the build rocks! I tested it PvP in a training hall vs several opponents, and with max buffs IKD is tough to resist, so this is doable even in PvP, from what I could see, since you can hit and damage most opponents (as with all clerics). Epic dodge gives an edge. Of course, those who can debuff you will make mayhem, but with a few heals, you can last awhile even then. From an rp perspective, I think short-swords would be better, but that is only flavor. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

I really like the build (I have toyed around with a similar build (paladin instead of fighter).  what about taking of Cleric to 15 instead of 16 - doesn't level 15 get you level 8 spells (and 16 doesn't get you level 9)?  You could take rogue to 17 for an extra d6 of sneak attack.  That is a pretty marginal call.  What about rapier with a shield for a weapon, too?  Does rapier work with weapon finesse?

agreed with CD.<br>you should try and compare the spell layout of a lvl 15 and 16 cleric. a lvl 16 cleric can go on for a bit longer.<br>my sualy spell layout has 3 extended divine favors, 3 extended prayers, 3 extended divine powers, 3 extended battle tides, 2 imp invis and then some other stuuf. but an extra few spells from lvl 16 really help out.

I have a Ranger23/Cleric13/Fighter4 that is very similar, but you summarized the differences very well.  Your "Ranger" gets sneak attacks, Epic Dodge, Tumble, and more spells.  The few advantages of the Ranger class are definitely overshadowed by the advantages of your "Ranger".  To me the Tumble and Epic Dodge alone are better than the +2 AB, +5 DMG +2d6 DMG, +5 Spot/Listen checks, and + Hide spells of the Ranger, especially when you don't have the hitpoints to spare. <br><br>This is really a good build to show how weak the Ranger class really is.<br><br>It's hilarious how this is a better "Ranger" than you can get using the Ranger class.  Good one Mith!
