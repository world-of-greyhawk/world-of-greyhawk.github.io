Cool build. A Smiter with good AB. Plus the fallen angel concept is cool. Kind of a big hit on the other stats, unfortunately. I might be inclined to give up two Great Smites for two Great CONs, but that's me. It's too bad there is no Anti-Paladin base class because then becoming a fallen Paladin kind of has to be a delibrate action to qualify for Blackguard. You would never have those five cross-class ranks in Hide otherwise. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  I guess to make the transition you could fall from grace then take a Fighter level where you take your Hide ranks, then start guarding the black. But that would involve a seventh and useless fighter level, or the loss of another BG level to have eight, and you would have to wait a whole level after betraying the goody-goodies to get your pretty implements of mass destruction from your new god. Leave it to me to get into some long RP spiel. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Why did you start as a paladin, to exploit the double-charisma-save bonus?  Not really a critique (I have a build that does that too) so much as a question... is there a way you might have done this without needing an align change and with replacing paladin in the build with a class who gets tumble maybe?<br><br>Con 8 and int 8 made me cringe when I saw them, but your hps are (barely) acceptable in the end despite that.  And I can accept the sparse skillpoints as a tradeoff for the hard smites.<br><br>I particularly like the AB... lack of AB keeps me from getting excited over most smiter builds.  I personally, however, would be likely to go sword-and-board (maybe scimitar for frequent crits), since the AC boost of a +5 shield is pretty hard to pass up.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Xylophone on 10/13/06 10:51</span></i></p>

I've basically the same suggestions I had for this build's antagonist. Go for a lesser Great smite and rebalance starting stats. I'd rather use Great Sword or Scimitar and Board.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?

Ah, GS 9 (or GS 10) –AND- AB, …. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">      <br><br>Merlin, right on – RP on mate, RP on! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">     <br><br>Xylo, Kail: so good to see you guys (thanks! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      <br>I suspect many here might think that Fallen (and his nemesis) are PG characters, thus not *really* playable per se, but I assure everyone here that this is not the case; yes, of course, with all the hard smites these two are PG, it goes without saying, but with good AB and other neat twix to back up all that great smiting once spent I assure everyone, you won’t miss the skill loss --really. That AB makes all the difference, it really does, with everything (AC, AB/Damage, Saves, etc.) all being boostable merely by boosting charisma, thanks to all the divines and blessings stuff, which cha. can't be dispelled, nor crippled, etc. <br><br>As everyone here knows, since me Templar series, I’ve been at this nut for awhile now, out to get all those GS’ in there while keeping with my philosophy as to the need for good AB – thus striking the ultimate balance b/w smite and combat (so glad to be able to share these results, and to see the excitement (thanks, guys: with your inspiration, ideas and encouragement, we got us here the best of the best in terms of AB and smite -- I say most humbly, and thanks to all of you).<br><br>As to intel., Xylo, it’s not 8 but 9 (any less would mean s/he talks funny, which we can’t have of course; but yeah, skills suffer, with HPs right on the line, in order to get all those GS in there and yet maintain AB (sacrifices, for sure, but looks so darn good, er, make that evil …, doesn’t it? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">       ) That said, for those of you who want more HPs and skills, I've posted an alternate version with 1 less smite (i.e., 34 smite damage for +40 HPs, +1 Fort, +43 skills), as requested (see, next post), assuming of course you can live with *only* GS 8 (or GS 9) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">      But before we go there, let's turn to those great questions and comments first.<br><br>Weapon Choices (AC vs. Damage)<br>If it’s more AC you want (and let’s be honest, always good <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    in addition to cha boost (div shield), your suggestion re: scimmy and board would do the trick, and it’s a good suggestion. Weapons are very much a personal choice thing, I agree. For me, on fallen angel, I went for optimum damage, selecting greataxe for its damage multiplier on a crit (somewhat also RP factor (something about it just looks/feels right; enhanced by fire or (better) acid (since more PCs do fire resistance than acid, not to mention eye-ball appeal of seeing acid drip,…highly recommended <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">      ). That said, Fallen has WS/EWS: as it relates to scimmy, these feats do somewhat temper some (but not all) concerns re: overall damage as a scimmy does do less (keeping in mind also that WS/EWS enhances axe damage also, and it also multiplies on a crit.). On the other hand, as you guys well point out, scimmy has a better crit range than axe – thus forcing more crits (and potentially thus damage), and with the added benefit of permitting Fallen’s use of a tower board, thus AC. Of course, greatsword is a great weapon choice, too: it does very good overall damage with a nice damage multiplier on a crit (as compared to scimmy, although not as high as axe), and w. a wider crit. range than axe (though not as wide as a scimmy); these are all important factors to consider in choosing one’s weapon, agreed (as always, great suggestions).<br><br>Paladin (Benefits) and Alignment (avoidance)<br>Xylo – (btw: missed ya <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      as to Paladin, good question: yes, there's cha bonus, definitely. Also, and not just the RP (although there’s that, too), there’s important synergy b/w pally &amp; BG (pally counts toward BG smiting, which a tumble-class wouldn’t get; then, for more AC can go the board/scimmy option and/or simply increase cha, putting divine shield to good use; as to those divines, pally gets you the 'extra turning' feat for the extra charges (which otherwise our Fallen wouldn’t enjoy). The only other class that gets ExTurn as a selectable feat is the cleric (I do believe), but cleric wouldn’t really add anything here, detracting from the overall character in terms of both BAB/AB and also smite-damage (cleric doesn’t count towards BG, and would also mean having to wait for all that BG evilness).<br><br>On the other hand, that said, using cleric instead of pally would enable you to avoid “the fall” / alignment change, as per your very good question. (In fact, such a character may bear further investigation, having taken a look on the pulse cap). Ah, but as to this one, promise you, it’s not only incredibly fun, but also super duper easy to fall – it really, really is, just listen to the call of the dark side, does it not beckon you? Do you not feel it’s power? C’mon, are you not curious? Power for power’s sake, and all those other evil goodies -- all yours for the taking, just take a step; that’s it, reach out and come closer; the dark side awaits you (isn’t that right, Merlin? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">      ) <br><br>And now, without further adieu, what follows is the alternative version<br><br>ps. to Kail - thanks so much for the edit, and the big w/b greeting, too (very kind of you; please know I missed all of you guys, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 10/13/06 22:05</span></i></p>

I didn't realize paladin counted towards smite good, just that paladin and champion of torm would stack for smite evil.  This is the first time I've heard about paladin stacking with blackguard for smite good... if so, it makes a bit more sense.<br><br>The prereq for Extra Turning is the Turn Undead feat, which blackguards themselves get.  You'd have to wait to get it, but you could still get extra turning without either paladin or cleric.<br><br>In either event, not a bad build at all.  On the weapon thing - with a smiter I'd go with a weapon that had a high threat range and could be keened, rather than a high multiplier.  The reason is because you have a very limited number of smites per day, making frequent crits more attractive than harder crits - even though you can crit for over 1000 damage with a scythe, it's kind of a parlor trick because of the low threat range - you're not going to crit at all most days.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
