<i>Slashing, Terrifying and Fearlessly Raging into Battle PvM (1-40) and PvP</i><br><br><b>VIKING BERSERKER (Bear Warrior)</b><br>Joint Authors (in Alphabetical Order): By Deborah “Tyr” Templar and Grimnir77*<br><br><i> *Note: I would like to thank Grim, our resident Master of Norse Lore, for his unsurpassed knowledge of Norse Lore, and his comments throughout the building of this character (from conceptualization to character), which I appreciate, and do herein acknowledge. As such, he deserves half the credit for this build.</i><br><br><b>The Concept: FEARSOME WARRIOR</b><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br><br>Berserkers were loyal to their Viking war god Odin and believed he would protect them, give them superhuman strength and if they died an heroic death, a place in Valhalla in the afterlife. Consequently, berserkers were also called "Odin men." They fought in groups . . . and often charged heedlessly into the ranks of the enemy or formed a circle to provide the best defense when outnumbered by an opponent. Their unpredictable behaviour and bear-like appearance were meant to strike fear in the enemy and demoralize him so much, he would not fight. When the berserkers did fight, it was to the death.<br><br>The existence of the berserker is recorded in the writings of Christian missionaries and monks who claimed to have witnessed their (frenzied state). In some of the Viking sagas, berserkers are portrayed as ferocious fighters . . . (and are) also preserved in Viking art. Chess pieces depicting a berserker show them biting their shields. Viking foil reliefs picture them dressed in bear or wolf skins . . . The word berserker comes from two Norse words bjorn meaning bear or bare (naked) and serkr meaning shirt, a reference to the fact that a berserker warrior went into battle dressed in bear skins or without any armor at all. Berserkers thought that by wearing the fur of the bear, they would become possessed by the animal's spirit and would gain its strength-a way of shape-shift into the animal's form. Shape-shifting was important as their pagan gods also had this ability. The meaning of the word berserker is derived from another characteristic of this warrior- berserkergang- a word meaning crazed behaviour. Before a battle, berserkers spent hours working themselves into a frenzy . . . This state, they believed, made them immune to pain and helped them shrug off . . . (their enemies’) blows.” <br><br>Excerpted and adapted from, Jim Cornish, “Viking Warriors: The Berserker,” in: The Vikings, and available at: <a href="http://www.cdli.ca/CITE/vikings.htm" target="_blank">http://www.cdli.ca/CITE/vikings.htm</a> </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><i>The Build – Pros and Cons:</i><br>This build is based on the above Norse lore, being very fun and also unique (being the first, according to Pulse, to utilize this class combo): with a very nice AB, incl. the ability to self-cap strength (especially good unshifted, but dire bear is a good performer, too), enjoying high HPs and access also to druid and Harper magic, incl. DR, all of which nicely compliments / evolves around the barbarian’s terrifying rage/berserker ability (with a high DC, and also enduring—at 8 rounds (9 w. frenzy) as human, and even better (i.e., 10 rounds/11 w. frenzy) as dire bear).<br><br>While saving throws are all quite decent (thanks to druid buffs, Harper abilities, and greater rage), and so, too, is AC while human (thanks to HS skills/abilities, and druid buffs), AC might be a problem in shifted form, due largely in part to the equipment merging rules (i.e., when all dressed for battle in magic gear, etc., not all will merge when shifted, hence your AC in shifted form will be reduced); as such, you’ll want to buff up prior to shifting, and put that Terr. Rage to good use (knowing you can always shift back to human, in the event you should need to, but really, w. that Terr.Rage DC, … <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>Otherwise, dire bear (improved animal form) is a surprisingly good shape, with over 900 effective HPs (and enjoying also the extended rage duration) to withstand the heat; also comes w. his/her own bear clan/group (i.e., druid summons (dire bear) and companion (bear)). The main drawback of this build is that it takes awhile to get to dire bear shape; this was done in order to get Terrifying Rage early (while preserving BAB/offense) and to make good use of Harper (tumble skills and class abilities, incl. skill foci/feats, which in turn bolsters defense while contributing also to terrifying rage DC, etc., and regardless of form, enhancing the build’s playability overall). As such, the combination makes for a solid melee warrior—the Viking Berserker, being unique. Without further ado, please meet (in human form, followed by dire bear (impr.animal/wildshape) form): <br><br><br><br><b><i>VIKING BERSERKER (Bear Warrior)</i></b><br>Barbarian(23), Druid(12), Harper Scout(5)<br>Race: Human / Alignment: Any Neutral, Non-Lawful, Non-Evil (Theme: CN or True Neutral)<br><br><i>Attributes:</i><br>STR: 16 (30)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 16<br>INT: 12<br>CHA: 8<br><br><i> Level Guide:</i><br>01: Barbarian(1): alertness, weapon focus: battleaxe –or- greataxe<br>02: Barbarian(2): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>03: Barbarian(3): iron will<br>04: Barbarian(4): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>05: Barbarian(5)<br>06: Barbarian(6): knockdown<br>07: Barbarian(7)<br>08: Barbarian(8): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>09: Barbarian(9): blind fight<br>10: Barbarian(10)<br>11: Barbarian(11)<br>12: Barbarian(12): STR+1, improved critical: weapon, (STR=19)<br>13: Barbarian(13)<br>14: Barbarian(14)<br>15: Barbarian(15): improved critical: unarmed<br>16: Barbarian(16): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>17: Barbarian(17)<br>18: Barbarian(18): toughness (or: heavy armor prof. –or- sf: intimidate)*<br>19: Barbarian(19)<br>20: Barbarian(20): STR+1, (STR=21)<br>21: Druid(1): epic weapon focus: weapon<br>22: Harper Scout(1): epic skill focus: intimidate<br>23: Druid(2)<br>24: Barbarian(21): STR+1, terrifying rage, (STR=22)<br>25: Druid(3)<br>26: Druid(4)<br>27: Druid(5): epic prowess<br>28: Harper Scout(2): STR+1, (STR=23)<br>29: Druid(6)<br>30: Druid(7): great strength I, (STR=24)<br>31: Barbarian(22)<br>32: Harper Scout(3): STR+1, (STR=25)<br>33: Druid(8): great strength II, (STR=26)<br>34: Druid(9)<br>35: Druid(10)<br>36: Druid(11): STR+1, great strength III, (STR=28)<br>37: Harper Scout(4)<br>38: Druid(12)<br>39: Harper Scout(5): great strength IV, epic skill focus: taunt, (STR=29)<br>40: Barbarian(23): STR+1, (STR=30)<br><br>•	Weapon/Armor Note: Viking Warriors—the Berserker, wore a bear-skin over his/her chain (or, sometimes, just the skin), and wielded an axe (heavy axe or battleaxe); that said, you are of course free to equip your Berserker as you see fit.<br><br>---<br><br><b>PART A.

This is rather unique and I quite like the concept.  What you can do, to gain Dire Bear earlier, is to drop some of your pre-epic Barb.  You can easily go with Bard16/Druid4 pre-epic, take Barb17 at Level 24 and still nail TR.  One doesnt need to be epic.  This should accelerate Druid abilities, and you should easily have 7 levels of Druid by Level 23.  After TR at 24, you can go more Druid and get that shape that you want.<br><br>However, I see why you took Barb to 23, and I see why you took Druid to 12.  Is there any compromise to be made to get Barb24 (and a bonus feat), or to drop Barb to 17-20 and add more to Druid?  Since HS is capped, we have to question it's utility (and price to be paid), so it seems like there might be some built in wiggle room, if you catch my meaning.....<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Well, I don't really favor taking Harper Scout on a Druid, it is on my opinion that it's a bad combination, in strict terms of power.<br><br>You've tested this? I mean, on real combat, because I could actually doubt the Dire Bear will be stronger than your human form, since on human form you get full equipment compared to a Dire Bear, I think the Dire Bear gets +1 for breaching purposes, or something low like that, I always had trouble with DR enemies when I tried using Dire Bear (say, my Elemental forms spent for the day and I tried Dire Bear), but the human form with a weapon (I'm thinking Greataxe) that has Epic Weapon Focus (contrary to shifted where you can't) might actually deal better damage.

<i>Bear vs. Human</i><br>Thax – good to see ya, and really appreciate the question/clarification, but I never said dire bear’s stronger than human. As noted at the outset, this is a strong themed build, but also makes for a strong bbn, having access to magic and of course, the berserker theme/bear shape (which be really fun and unique). That said, what dire bear gives us (apart from theme, in terms of his power/contribution build-wise), is a HP monster (over 920 effective HPs, w. grt. stoneskin on him and extended rage duration (maybe you misunderstood what I meant? – that’s totally cool, and pas problem <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>And you’re totally right re: as against DR enemies, his claw/bite don’t breach nor can you make it so, since weapons don’t mere on animals, you’re absolutely correct. Hence, like the big bad wolf in the story of the 3 little pigs, bear can huff and puff and TR all he wants, but TR ain’t by itself going to breach DR – in which case, yes, go human and regain/crack down w. yer  (great) axe <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br><i>Harper Scout</i><br>Thanks, Griz (and good to you, too, Grizzled one!). I'll explain the leveling. First and foremost, this is a raging/str-based barbarian, so havy on the barb. but at the same time, wanted a decent shape (i.e. dire bear) for the berserker theme (w 5 druid getting you wildshape, and 12 for the impr forms, none of which can cast druid spells/druid scrolls in shifted form). <br><br>In light of the merge rules, this build needs two things:<br><br>a)	full BAB (i.e., since shapes can’t enhance their AB beyond the rage/str buffs (and taunt), being unarmed fighters (and gloves wouldn’t merge anyway, even if we had them), hence running up barb to preserve same, allowing us also to get our TR nice and early (note: human at natural AB 46 (self-buff (rage/str) to 52 +6 Taunt (-2 non-wilderness) can afford to lose a point or two, but didn’t feel the shapes could (i.e., at 48 + 6 Taunt, or 54 str/rage buffed (-2 non-wilderness), that’s pretty much it for the shapes since, once again, weapons don’t merge and can’t otherwise enhance your animal claw/bite by casting grt magic fang or awaken on yourself (as noted above);  hence, the need to preserve our BAB (AB) and in turn, running w barb  (else the shapes suffer as, once again, no other way apart from our str/rage to get their AB up …<br><br>b)	in addition, this build needs tumble, (nice for human, but a must have really for the shapes, due once again to the merge rules), so HS became the only real option (no xp penalty and costs a lot less while fits the theme well. This, as compared to assassin (waste 32 skills and evil req’t), SD (2 feats and 41 skills), whereas HS costs only 14 skills and wastes 1 feat (i.e. alertness, since the other (iron will) is useful, and esp. on a barb.) In turn, we get +8 AC (being 4 more than cross-classing, and 2 more even than cross-classing w. AS together, w. AS itself costing a feat (only a more valuable one, being an epic slot and for a mere +2 ac, as compared to what tumble gives). Seen from this light, cost of HS for tumble’s a lot cheaper (and better by comparison), while giving us some useful other stuff (like save boosts, and HS cat’s for e.g. which, unlike druid spell/scrolls, can be used when shifted)<br><br>c)	in light also of spreading our stats (to achieve druid spells, have a decent enough skills selection, without giving up either HPs (con) or offense (STR), we also needed feats – yes, as noted, HS wastes one (pre-ep alertness, worth it as expl above though in terms of what it gives back in defense), but HS moreover and in addition gives us 2 epic bonus feats, selectable on which are ESFs (as in, ESF: Intim, important for bbn TR (whether human or shifted), and also ESF: Taunt, which is nice for human and perhaps unnecessary, but felt it was nonetheless important for shapes – <br><br><i>The “Compromise” <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    </i><br><br>This in turn dictated the level split, as in, 12 druid (min), plus 5 HS (for the tumble and 2 epic bonus feats, for the ESFs), leaving 23 barb and the perfect no for DR – (yes, GD; and Barb. 24 gets boni feat, you’re right, but so too does HS 5); that said, as to going Barb 24/HS 4/Druid 12, that’s a most dobable alternative, too – and def. a good one, as will net you another rage use, too (in lieu of HS invis. and HS craft item (potions)); if so, just drop 1 HS in exchange for another barb. (24 barb giving you the bonus feat back as noted, along with +6 HPs and another rage/TR use (meaning, /x7 uses per day or rest, being one more than our current /x6); Will have to move ESF: Taunt to a general feat, though, i.e., where EP currently is, since ESF’s not selectable as a barb bonus feat (but EP is). (Although there’s something I think to be said for the 5 Harpers, heh, another rage round this way, that’s also some nice thinking, Thax and Grizz - thanks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br><i>ESF:Taunt vs. More Druid Spells—Another Alternative:</i><br>Another option, but which I don’t really recommend (not if you want reliable taunting power for your animal shapes that is, anyway), is to swap 1 HS for barb 24, as above, and drop yet another 2 HS for more druid (in other words, drop HS down to 2 (one at level 22 for the free ESF: intim and playability tumble dump, the other HS at level 39 for the rest of tumble), bump EP down to barb 24’s bonus feat, as above, and picking up a grt wisdom (in lieu of esf: taunt) where EP currently is. The extra wis and 2 druid boost (for a total barb 24/HS 2/ Druid 14) will give you slightly better druid buffs, while netting you more of them, incl. access to two (2) seventh level druid spells (among others, creeping doom, being a nice damage spell, along w. true seeing, harm, and AoV (w. AoV pretty much alone making up for the loss of HS cat’s and tym smile, since it gives you and your allies +4 each to STR, DEX and Con. (in turn, while we already self-cap str., always nice to have more options (plus, our allies will like it, too), while at the same time giving you the ability (w. rage &amp; frenzy) to further cap your own con, which in turn gives you +2 fort, another 80 HPs, and (even more importantly) another 2 full rounds of rage/TR power, which (let’s face it) also be sweet… Boils down to a toss up as b/w +10 on your taunt check, or more druid, and hence your own preference … <br><br>Either way, (and this be Grimmer’s idea and I love it so much that I just gotta share) might consider calling yourself ‘summoned bear,’ call your companion “summoned bear”, and then summon a bear b/f morphing into bear; even better if, while a bear, you and your brew hook up with a party (as the bbn tank in disguise as a bear). When the enemy attacks, mistaking you for someone’s pet, heh, be sure to rage/TR, and switch back to human as necessary, cracking down with your axe … (heh, just so darn sneaky as to be absolutely brilliant it is, as was all his help on this one (for which I thank him again); and so, too, are your thoughts/suggestions, guys – really, thanks.

I liked the themed build.  But I would question why you raised your natural strength up so high when you know that Dire Bear form overrides it.<br><br>Your last Strength boost happens after you get Dire Bear form.  Dumping those points into Wisdom would net you more spells.  Charisma would give you a point more in your intimidate.<br><br>I would try to take ESF Intimidate instead of Taunt since your Terrifying rage DC is based on that.  Since your rage aura can affect more than one opponent at a time, I would favor it over taunt.  If they are feared from your rage, they get a -2 on saves, which is technically a +2 to your taunt check.<br><br>If you have Stoneskin on, your ability to overcome DR on your opponent increases.<br><br><br>I would suggest having one armor item with a high + value, and the other armor items have the regeneration ability.

Nifty build Tyr. I like the concept a lot. I think I'd take a second look at Grizz's suggestion of going with 24 BBN though. What you can do it drop 1 HS level. You lose the ESF feat (I'd drop ESF:Taunt, as you can still pretty much Taunt anything but casters without the ESF feat), and go with Armor Skin as your BBN bonus feat. This will help you with some of your AC woes (and offset the penalty to AC when Raging).<br><br>If you go that route, you could easily switch the positions of Epic Prowess and Armor Skin, depending on if you find +1 AB or +2 AC to be more beneficial to your character at an earlier stage.<br><br>*edit* Bromium, Epic Skill Focus:Intimidate is taken at character level 22 as the HS1 bonus feat.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 06/04/07 17:55</span></i></p>

Thanks everyone for all the great interest, comments, and compliments on this one (so very kind of all of you, and great to see you all! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>Galelabriel, Thax, Avado: thanks! And, heh, I almost fell off of my chair lol when Grimmer told me that one (heh, he’s a great sense of humor, our Grim, and he’s far too modest <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>Cinn: appreciate your kind compliment, too (thanks!). AS, eh? Yeah, that’s a useful feat, too – I think it may help you stay in bear shape a bit longer, and what the heck, help our human too (you’re right of course re: ESF taunt, most meelee’rs simply don’t train conc. to resist a taunt, even if they could, so don’t really need it as a human anyway (and bear, well, since items etc. don’t merge on him, only armor (helm, shield, suit) not exactly gonna go up against casters in bear form anyway (I mean, well, his saves all buffed are nice, but not that nice …  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    <br><br>On the other hand, if want to bug casters, then, even although you’ve ice storm, can also go barb. 24/ HS2/ Druid14, dropping ESF: Taunt and adjusting to take on a Grt.Wisdom for access to i.e. creeping doom … that indeed be some “wiggle room” (Dwarflord, you crack me up, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   Speaks also to Bromium’s pref. for more spells, too --- doing so wld cost eagle's (buffs taunt &amp; intim) and Cat's (refl and AC) though ... really depends on where one plays and their preferences though, and whether they intend to be human most of the time and relegate bear to ‘cool-factor’, or want as much as they can as bear … It's all good <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Bromium: and reason why we want to ensure a good human, re: str. question – keeping in mind a) items, weap. don’t merge (only armor on shapes), and b) human nat. AB 46 (sleeping in the woods) beats bear’s nat. AB 42 (sleeping in the woods) – yeah, rage/buff etc. for more, and to the extent your enemy’s not fear-immune, def. TR/rage is wonderful (but in the event of immunity, well, …  in which case, go human and show them your str-based greataxe (ways I sees it, and w. Thax on this, if someone forces you to unshift, should make them pay for it, right? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">      Then, yeah, if you want to cast say ice and creeping, soften ‘em up and then go in as bear … that is really good idea, too (and thanks for that, and really appreciate your compliment, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>All that said, this really is a fun build; No, not an uber/all-powerful or anything (again, bear’s playable/decent, don’t get me wrong, esp in low magic settings; but in your standard/up to +5 world, you are def. going to shift back to human. Hence, what we have here is a solid (human) melee’r, who makes bear quite playable and fun (puts a smile on my face to see enemies fleeing in fear from TR’ing bear (and uh, let’s face it, if I were out in the woods and along came a raging large bear, well, I do believe I’d flee, too! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    ) <br><br>As to any PvP (team-play), you’ll def. go human as tank member of the team, w. your standard melee’r save items and of course magical greataxe (none of which, items or weapons once again merge on animal shapes); while human doesn’t have the awesome bear HPs, he does have over 500 nat. HPs (rage etc. for more), plus a very nice nat. AB 46 (rage etc. for more), and we manage a decent AC on him too (even better w. AS, yes? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      anyway, a solid meelee’r is our human here, who flies solo pvm and dishes on behalf of his party pvp – of course, once all is said and done, please do feel free to morph and glory dance as dire bear (not only fun to watch and do, but gives you that cool RP “I’m a berserker/bear warrior” feeling, in theme w. the build!)<br><br>Thanks again everyone, and Rage/Claw/Slash On! ~ Tyr <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br><br><i>DR and Equipment:</i><br>Quick note (for benefit of new members): Bromium makes an exc. point re stoneskin (and grt. stoneskin) wh. transforms shape’s unarmed attacks (hence, dire bear') into a +5 weapon for purposes of bypassing DR (but not for AB/dam. purposes), but the ‘transformation’ effects of stoneskin (grt’r) only last so long as the spell’s up (i.e., not expired by time or after absorbing the specified amount of melee damage). True, TR/rage does help here, so far as enemies aren’t hitting on you (wearing out your stoneskin/grt. stoneskin) when fleeing in fear. Otherwise though, bear claws aren’t magical weapons, innately speaking (but can be made so by a perma-DR armor piece, whether helm, suit or shield, and def. to enjoy bear shape more, might want to get some DR armor in addit. the props. he wisely recommends, and I thank him for <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/17/07 05:30</span></i></p>
