This is a build I started using in modules and on new servers when I was just getting the feel of things. He's surprisingly effective and versatile, and good fun to play. The original concept was a Dwarven mercenary type, which is why I chose many of the feats and skills I did (exotic weapons, and the trap skills). I pictured him as a well-worn, hardened mercenary who knew a few tricks, had honed his skills to the point that he created much of his own luck, and could readily take on a mission and get the job done. <br><br>This has been sitting in my vault for some time, and I ran across it the other day while sorting through some files. Nothing really new and innovative here, but I thought it was worth posting, as this level split has not been posted that I could see.

You could easily drop 4 FTR levels and replace it with 4 CoT, taking Armor Skin as the CoT bonus epic feat. You'd get +2 on all your saves and only lose out on 20 HPs. Most likely a better idea.

Seems to me with a reflex save as high as this guy's, Improved Evasion is very rarely going to be any better than regular Evasion, because you're almost never going to fail a save.  That being the case, wouldn't you do better with Crippling Strike?

As I said, there are a number of feat choices you could change to suit your taste and playstyle.<br><br>Cheers.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I'd definitely go Crippling Strike.<br><br>Solid build.  Very handy for getting to know a new environment, and very nicely suited to dungeon crawling.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
