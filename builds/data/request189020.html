Hey, im new to the whole building of characters, but was wondering if anyone can build a melee character that dual wields Bastard Swords, gets Devastating Crit and has a high AC?  I've tried looking for chars which dual wield BSwords, but couldn't find any.  Why is that?<br><br>Also, what are the best online servers to play?  Anyways, thanks to anyone who can help. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Dual wielding bastardswords invites -4/-4 penalty to your attacks (main hand/offhand) using smaller weapons only has  -2/-2. You need to take the feat Weapon Proficiency (exotic) for a weapon that doesnt have much of a benefit (other than an average of 1 damage) over the longsword. Its much rarer to find a good magical bastardsword than a longsword or a shortsword. And it has an average crit range. Whereas kukris , scimitars and rapiers have a greater crit range. Greater crit range means that you are more likely to dev crit.<br><br>Bastardsword is generally taken as a roleplay option. A roleplayer would unlikely dual wield 2 of them. This is why their are so few builds.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

Bastard swords are good for base damage but are pretty heavy.. plus no weapon finesse so no dex AC..  could go mage with 19 int and tonnes of dex with pathetic AB just wield them to look cool? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>-DaMouse

Aye...its a pain dual wielding with a non finessable weapon.<br><br>But, Id imagine that something like ranger 9+, WM 18-22, SD rest,  with a fair balance between dex and str, obviously getting str 25 for dev crit might be a decent approach.  <br><br>I remember that I have a ranger/WM/SD build that uses kukris has epic dodge and overwhelming crit and bane of enemies somewhere,  But again the dual wielding bastard swords thing is a lil odd and a fairly hard work around.

I'd imagine something along the lines of FTR/bard/PM. That is the only viable way a str based dual wielder can get AC.

OK.  So the dual wield Bastard sword is a bit weird.  HEHE sorry guys. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   I've just always had a thing for hand and a half swords.  I just love them in real life, and yeh.  Thats what I have always wanted to build as a character.<br><br>Whats the closest thing to it then?  Dual wielded Katana's?  Rapiers?  Longswords?  Anyone point me in the direction of the best Dual Wielding fighter?

Khukuris or rapiers are my favored variant of dual wield<br><br>-DaMouse

What is the best build depends on what you are up against and how good items you get in the mod you play. <br>If you meet opponents with High AC, a build with high AB is best. If you meet opponents with lots of HP, DR and a lower AC, a build with focus on damage dealing is better.<br>A dev crit build is best against opponents with a low fort save and low AC. <br><br>When you dual wield, you sacrifice AC (shield) and AB (dual wield penalty) to get more attacks/ round. The point is to deal more damage against more enemies, before you take too much damage yourself. It's all right to dual wield bastard swords if you can afford the AB hit. Maybe you want to use a sword/ shield combo against the high AB/AC opponents. Many dual wielders have a shield in their backpack for such encounters.<br><br>If you have a str based dual wielder with the exotic feat, you should also consider the double weapons. A two bladed sword does the same damage as two longswords. But the AB hit is only -2/-2.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...
