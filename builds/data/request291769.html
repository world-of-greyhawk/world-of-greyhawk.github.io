<i>I am getting ready to enter a fighting contest on my server.<br><br>The only banned class is PM.<br><br>I am looking for orc build, with high AB, decent AC, and Dev Crit. Saves are not that important, well fort is. There is no magic involved as spell casters are having there own contest. Any help would be appreciated. I have checked the chac build search engine, but there are so many, not sure which would be the best. I was looking at MIth's Master fo Melee build ,but that is human, not sure if I could switch to Half-orc or not.</i>

How come you ask for Tank and what you list you want is offense? I was kinda hoping the request would work for a Dwarven Defender build when I read the topic but there are no Orcish Defenders here <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>When I read Dev Crit and AB my mind always goes thinking Red Dragon Disciple or Weapon Master... minding PvP and no magics, I'll probably take a Fighter 10 / Monk 2 / Weapon Master 28, but I just like the kama cheese, mind me, a Fighter 6 / Champion of Torm 6 / Weapon Master 28 with scimitar and shield is probably better, it rounds up very good stats and since PM is banned, the critical hits are ought to work nicely.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Are there alignment restrictions?<br><br>If not, I'd definitely recommend a 23 Pally 2 Bard 15 RDD.  Gets respective AC w/ or w/o Divine Shield (don't go half-orc if you want d-shield), very very high AB, solid dmg, and good dev DC (51 or 51 if I recall correctly).<br>_________________<br>For the Bioware joke of the day, press Ctrl + W.
