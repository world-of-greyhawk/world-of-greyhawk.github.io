trying to create a strange combo of character paladin/palemaster would this work? given that my paladin is level 10 thought id turn to necromancy for a few levels! so would this class work (thinking ahead paladin lev15/wizlev3/pal mas lev22)any ideas on feats or would this class not work?

The class would work if you are able to do the Alignement shift.  Paladins are Lawfull Good only, and Palemasters are any non good. So leveling up and mixing Paladin at higher levels will be hard.<br><br>As for feats... that's hard since you need quite a few different Stats for that type of build.<br><br>If you don't plan on casting mage spells, then that solves a few problems.<br><br>I'd try to get 21 con and take some Epid Damage Reduction.  Pair that with your crit immunity and you'll be smilling.<br><br>Gnome might be a good choice since you get +2 con, and does not suffer from xp penalty from your wiz class.  The -2 str hurts tho, but is not a show stopper.<br><br>If you take Dwarf, then you get a -2 cha hit, and with your Paladin abilities... that will hurt you more than -2 str.

I'd make him human. BTW, if you didn't plan to build your character like that from the beginning, chances are it's not going to be very good if you spontaneously decide to go for that. Paladin/Wizard/PN doesn't have any obvious synergies. IMO. You should plan it beforehand and then post it here <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 04/26/06 12:05:52 (GMT) -- Ithacan<br><br>[...]Harper Scout, the only class so powerful it's capped at five. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    <br>[...]</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Hmm the way I would do this if I were going to be creating the build on a PW where I have to work to change my alignment...<br><br>I'd go level 1-3 as a LG wizard, then change to paladin for 14 levels.  Then be evil until my alignment changes to LN and go pale master until level 39.  At 39, be good until my alignment changes to LG, take level 40 as paladin for a skill dump into discipline.<br><br>However... that's a little cheesey.  (You can make it cheesier by adding a second skill dump level someplace, too).<br><br>It looks like an interesting build actually, the kind I might be inclined to try in fact.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

There's a problem with Wizard 3/PM 22, however, and that's the extremely low caster level. I'd suggest something along the lines of Wizard 9/PM 16, which, conveniently enough, gets 9th level spells. Wizard 3/PM 22 does not; not even 8th level.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 04/26/06 12:05:52 (GMT) -- Ithacan<br><br>[...]Harper Scout, the only class so powerful it's capped at five. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    <br>[...]</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">
