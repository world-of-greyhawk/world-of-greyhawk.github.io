This is an RP build based on the Raymond Feist series.

You could take 1 instead of Fast Healing (or anything else you want, really, there wasn't anything critical at that feat level). But the idea was sort of to avoid focusing on any one weapon. He gets an AB of 46 with <i>every weapon in the game</i>, and an AB of 47 in the 4 he has a focus in. <br><br>The four WF were chosen to give him access to all 3 damage types, with high crit ranges on two of them, and both single-handed and two-handed weapons. You could take Dev Crit in one weapon at the cost of 2 points of Str, or drop 4 MoA levels for 4 Fighter levels to fit it in without losing any Str (drop Fast Healing, too), but again the idea was to have him be able to use nearly anything. He gets +3 to damage with every weapon in the game, and +5 with the two he has foci in (I chose the two with blunt damage and lower crit ranges for use against crit-immune enemies, the high crit range on the other weapons should more than make up for the 2 less damage).<br><br>Strike at the Core is very effective, with a DC of 39 (actually, it's only 36 in play testing - the DC is supposed to go up by 1 every 5th level in Epic but it doesn't work currently). Nevertheless, that's high enough to be very effective, and the Con drain with every attack with every weapon on top of his high base damage will quickly suck HP away even from high DR enemies.<br><br>Fighter is obvious for a base class, and monk is to reflect the training he got from Nakor the Isalani. Rogue probably makes for a better power build (you lose the free cleave, KD, and IKD, but gain access to UMD and all of the trap skills, plus some sneak damage). <br><br>Having access to unarmed strike means even if he starts without a weapon, he can still hit hard and often, and can Disarm and have the weapon go straight into his inventory. In fact, if you want to focus on this, you could drop one of the Weapon Specs for WF: Unarmed Strike, and take EWF: Unarmed Strike instead of Fast Healing in Epic levels to have him go around unarmed, take other people's weapons, and proceed to beat them silly with their own weapon.<br><br>In summary: <br>Advantages: High AB with any weapon (46-47), 5 attacks per round with Furious Assault, high damage with any weapon (+3 from GS/LP, +13 from Str, Con drain with every hit, Focused Strike lets you add another +4 damage for only -2 AB), can use every weapon in the game. <br><br>Disadvantages: Poor Will save, mediocre Reflex save (not great use of Evasion - look for save boosters, or maybe drop one of the WS feats for Lightning Reflexes).<br><br>TM

Nice build. I've been toying with the idea of a Man at Arms build myself, DEX based. <br><br>Low AC hurts. But with a high AB, and STR, you hit often and for a lot of damage. I like it.
