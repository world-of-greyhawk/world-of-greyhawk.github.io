<b>Playable from level 1 to 40... PVM or PVP</b><br><br>With my recent <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "240938", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Knight of Bahamut</a> build, this build was inevitable.  I wanted to make use of the RDD strength bonus to create a build that got a warrior level AB with only 3 attacks, so that divine power could add another attack at the higher AB bonus.  The build turns out very powerful, but virtually every incarnation of these classes ends up being very powerful.  There are a few builds with this class distribution, but none of them get an AB this high and remain relatively undispellable.  It's no good to spend 5 minutes buffing only have them all stripped by a scroll of greater dispel or MD.  The build will do best in no to mid magic settings, and should remain competitive in higher magic settings (maybe up to +12 or around there).  <br><br>This build is a testament to the disgusting synergy of power between the Cleric and the RDD, and the general lack of balance between classes.  The cleric gets way too many powerful buffing spells (IMHO divine favor should not have been added and harm should have had a fortitude save), and the RDD (IMHO should not have been added in the expansions) gets 14 attribute boosts in 10 levels as well as 4 points of AC. On top of this, add in the Bard's skill list and it is difficult not to get an obscenely powerful character with this class combo.<br><br>I chose War domain for Cat's Grace and Aura of Vitality over the almost standard Trickery.  Generally it's easier to find a scroll of improved invisibility than a scroll of aura of vitality.  <br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-Good AB.  Desipite only having a 25 BAB, he has a 42 AB with a Scimitar.  With buffs he can easily get a 66 without magic items, 68 with +4 Strength boost from items.<br>-3 Maximum AB attacks.  With Haste and Divine Power, this build gets 3 attacks at the maximum AB bonus.<br>-Good Damage. He does 13+1D6 points of damage unbuffed.  With buffs he does 40+2D6 points of damage on a regular hit.<br>-Good AC.  Without any magic items he can get a 59 AC (71 AC if he abuses the stacking of UEF).  Note that War domain was chosen for Aura of Vitality and Cat's Grace, if good Attribute boosting equipment is available he could use Trickery domain instead and pick up improved invisibility.<br>-Level 9 cleric spells with a caster level of 26.  He has a ton of buffs, healing magic, plus harm and word of faith.  He only has to worry about Mordenkainen's Disjunction removing his buffs.<br>-Ability to use mage scrolls and equipment from other classes.  He has a high UMD to use equipment from other classes and as a Bard he can use mage scrolls without UMD checks.<br>-Immunity to Fire and Sleep and Paralysis.<br>-Improved Knockdown.  Always useful against casters and hard hitting opponents.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br><br>-Mediocre Hitpoints.  With Aid, Endurance and Aura of Vitality he'll end up with over 600 hitpoints.<br>-Low Reflex Saving throw and mediocre Will and Fortitude Saves.  Vs. Spells the Will and Fortitude saves are okay, he can also cast an extended clarity to help with will saves and protection from negative energy, death ward and/or undeath's eternal foe will help with the fortitude save.  The Reflex Save is a weak point, though freedom of movement will help a bit.<br><br><b>Blood and Faith</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Human<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Any non lawful<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 16<br>DEX 8<br>CON 12 <br>INT 14<br>WIS 16<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>Levels 4, 8 and 12 Increase Wisdom<br>Levels 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36 and 40 Increase Strength <br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Bard 4<br>Cleric 26<br>Red Dragon Disciple 10<br><br><i>Clerical Domains</i><br>War and Travel <br><br><i>Level Distribution and Feats</i><br>Level 1: (Cleric 1): Toughness, Weapon Proficiency (Martial)<br>Level 2: (Cleric 2)<br>Level 3: (Cleric 3): Weapon Focus (Scimitar)<br>Level 4: (Cleric 4)<br>Level 5: (Cleric 5)<br>Level 6: (Cleric 6): Knockdown<br>Level 7: (Cleric 7)<br>Level 8: (Cleric 8 )<br>Level 9: (Cleric 9): Extend Spell<br>Level 10: (Cleric 10)<br>Level 11: (Cleric 11)<br>Level 12: (Cleric 12): Improved Knockdown<br>Level 13: (Cleric 13)<br>Level 14: (Cleric 14)<br>Level 15: (Cleric 15): Improved Critical (Scimitar)<br>Level 16: (Cleric 16)<br>Level 17: (Cleric 17)<br>Level 18: (Cleric 18 ): Blind-Fight<br>Level 19: (Cleric 19)<br>Level 20: (Cleric 20)<br>Level 21: (Cleric 21): Epic Weapon Focus (Scimitar)<br>Level 22: (Bard 1)<br>Level 23: (Red Dragon Disciple 1)<br>Level 24: (Red Dragon Disciple 2): Epic Prowess<br>Level 25: (Red Dragon Disciple 3)<br>Level 26: (Red Dragon Disciple 4)<br>Level 27: (Bard 2): Great Strength I<br>Level 28: (Red Dragon Disciple 5)<br>Level 29: (Red Dragon Disciple 6)<br>Level 30: (Red Dragon Disciple 7): Great Strength II<br>Level 31: (Red Dragon Disciple 8 )<br>Level 32: (Bard 3)<br>Level 33: (Red Dragon Disciple 9): Great Strength III<br>Level 34: (Red Dragon Disciple 10)<br>Level 35: (Cleric 22)<br>Level 36: (Cleric 23): Armor Skin, Great Strength IV<br>Level 37: (Cleric 24)<br>Level 38: (Cleric 25)<br>Level 39: (Cleric 26): Great Wisdom I, Great Strength V<br>Level 40: (Bard 4)<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 36<br>DEX 8<br>CON 14 <br>INT 16<br>WIS 20<br>CHA 10<br><br><i>AB and Damage</i><br>(no buffs, mundane Scimitar)<br>42/37/32 13+1D6 (15-20 x2)<br><br>(+8 to Strength, Haste, Divine Power, Bless, Aid, Prayer, Battletide, Divine Favor, Darkfire, Greater Magic Weapon, Scimitar)<br>66/61/56/66/66 23+1D6 (15-20 x2) (+7 magic) (+10+1D6 fire)<br><br>(+12 to Strength, Haste, Divine Power, Bless, Aid, Prayer, Battletide, Divine Favor, Darkfire, +5 keen Scimitar)<br>68/63/58/68/68 25+1D6 (12-20 x2) (+7 magic) (+10+1D6 fire)<br><br><i>AC</i><br>23 (no buffs no equipment)<br>34 (Full Plate, Tower Shield)<br>59 (+4 to DEX, Full Plate, Tower Shield, Shield of Faith, Magic Vestment x2, Haste, Undeath's Eternal Foe)<br>71 (+4 to DEX, Full Plate, Tower Shield, Shield of Faith, Magic Vestment x2, Haste, Undeath's Eternal Foe x4)<br>69 (+4 to DEX, +5 Full Plate, +5 Tower Shield, +5 Amulet of Natural Armor, +5 Ring of Protection, +5 Boots of the Sun Soul, Haste, Undeath's Eternal Foe)<br>76 (+4 to DEX, +5 Full Plate, +5 Tower Shield, +5 Amulet of Natural Armor, +5 Ring of Protection, +5 Boots of the Sun Soul, Haste, Undeath's Eternal Foe x3)<br><br><i>Final Saves (Vs.

Nice, I don't play a lot of Clerics, but I could see myself playing something like this.  One thing I saw though:  under base damage with mundane scimitar you have 13+1d10, I am thinking scimitar is 1d6, not 1d10.<br><br>Edit-  I also dont think that 436 hp is that bad for this type of char.

Funny that you posted this.  I built an almost identical version of this about two weeks ago, and it was just too powerful.  Take an overpowered PrC and combine it with an overpowered base class, and you have a god.  Unfortunately, I had to abandon the idea because of domain/alignment issues with the environ where I played.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Thanks for the feedback.<br><br>When I first designed this character I went with a katana instead of a scimitar, hence the 1D10.

Great battle cleric, this build rocks. <br><br>I'm playing the same class combo at the moment, but a caster cleric version getting Spell Foci and Spell Penetration feats pumping WIS only (RDD boni apart).<br><br>I would consider going Cleric 10/RDD 8/Bard 2 preepic starting out with Bard for more skillpoints and taking RDD 9-10 immediately in epic. It costs 1 AB and delays cleric into epic but you get back 20+ skillpoints and earlier stats bumps. I believe the choice would depend on the playing environment, as usual. Besides a pure cleric preepic is just mean <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>I love this combo and I love this mean fighting machine.

There was another thread on the main forums some time ago about how clerics are one of the few classes that are powerful regardless of magic level (argument went something like in pre-epic, if you balance the game to make it challenging for a battle-cleric, it becomes extremely challenging if not overpowering for other classes--I'm sure you've seen this one or something like it).  <br><br>This is an extremely powerful, well-designed build--as Mith's builds always are.  I generally don't build with RDD, but these two classes together are darn near unstoppable.  As I see it, the only thing that will really scare this guy is a spell breach or Mord's--and even then he won't be completely crippled with such a high base strength.  Epic-primary clerics always suffer from a sub-par reflex save as well, but cat's grace and high SR bridge that gap pretty nicely.  I also prefer to take cleric straight to 17 right away, as you have done.  Playable all the way up, and extremely powerful at 40.

I must say that this is one of the finer cleric builds I have seen, and I have seen a few in my day!  I have never thought about exploiting the div powers like you set up here, but I must say that I LOVE IT!!   I have startd my Blood and Faith out on his career (he's lvl 6 so far  LOL).  The ONLY change I made is to add Dev crit to the build.  Unlike almost everyone else here who has been bored silly with this feat, I have never bothered with it.  The only unfortunate thing is, to get DC i have had to remove KD/ikd?blind fight  and loose 2 gr str  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  .  The end result "should" be ok, but who knows, I may get to the end of her and wish I had listened to the master!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   <br><br>Oh, and lookin at jennas build, it is very interesting to see how, by taking almost the identical leveling progression, the choice of when to take feats results in a very different product.   Again, very nicely done.

Well, well - what a very nice surprise to come back to <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     You know, I suspected that my Dragon Slayer story might inspire a few more dragon characters, in fact, a little bird in Van (or was that a dragon? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     suggested that I would.

Maybe not your cup of tea, but if you take exactly the same feats, except you take 23 cleric/2 bard/15 rdd you end up with the same stats, but with +1 ac, more hps, and minus some skill points (14 taunt isn't really doing too much for the build atm).

in my experience (which is somewhat limited), I don't see greater dispel being used very often.

I'm a bigger fan of 26+ cleric levels.  It gives you the option of taking penetration feats to do some offensive casting.  I always would rather have an ability than not have it.  In fact that'd be my argument in favor of the 28 cleric (or 27 cleric) versions - you can get up to 32 SR penetrating ability with only 2 feats in those builds and not need epic penetration.<br><br>But if you're playing up, 4 bard makes for nice skill dumping.

This is one of those times, you wish RDD had been implemented properly and you gained the size increase you should have rendering you immune to the Bigby's hand spells.  In that case with the acid resistance feats this would make a fine mage slayer.  As it is, against a spellsword with 20 to 30 levels of an arcane class it should have a high enough strength to resist those spells.  As the rules stand now, against any build other than a dragon shifter or SR monk, all a focused arcane caster has to do to win is cast time stop+mordenkainen's disjunction+Biby's Grasping Hand (or Bigby's Crushing Hand against a rashaka ***er) and it's game over.  Since Mord's breaches spell resistance even a level 40 cleric is gonna get pounded by that combo.  <br><br>In a devastating critical environment, I would sooner play something like my <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "247143", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Hierophant of Velsharoon</a> build.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

<b>Nothing</b> makes you immune to spell disruption except passing the Concentration check. All ICC and DCM do is negate any attacks of opportunity against you for casting in combat. If you're hit (and you can still be hit by the mobs surrounding you), you still have to pass the Concentration check in order for your spell not to be disrupted, whether you're in DCM or you have ICC.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
