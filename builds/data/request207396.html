this sound like a very simple straight out build but I have not been plaing nwn some time I unsure of my judegment on building characers.  <br><br>I am looking for a cleric who emplores the use of harm and implosion with best defence possible.  it's gears consist of tower shield, staff, robe, and rest.  I said robe cuz I wanted to take advantage of monk wis armor so plz send me an reply or direct me to a pre-exsisting build  <br><br>P.S. in the server I am playing we are not allowed to use pm unless going 10 level first in either sorc or wiz and HIPS is useless considering all the monsters at high level area have true seeing<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Aretal on 08/06/05 05:42</span></i></p>

so far as i have found, you lost the monk ac from wisdom when using a shield, unless that has somehow been changed where you play.

Try 29 cleric / 10 cot / 1 monk<br><br>go all out on WIS, starting it on either 16 or 18. Take your defensive and casting feats and spell foci and you are set<br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while

As far as i can tell, the monk lvl isnt that useful for a cleric that uses a shield and one hand wpn.  I tested the wise elven priest build (posted) with 1 monk lvl at 40 and found that it did nothing for the build ( i play fp + tower).  Keep in mind that the character had 36 BASE wisdom, where you can add +12 to it from itms.   As i remember, the fp/wpn/twr was the clear winner (otherwise i would have posted the variant).<br><br>peace

You get a high AC if you drop the shield.<br><br>Compare with +5 equipment:<br><br>FP+5, Twr+5 = 13+8=+21 AC with max DEX =1 so total = 22<br><br>Clothing+5 = +5 AC with unlimited max DEX (assume starting with 12) +1, getting max WIS = (18+10+10+12=50)+20 WIS bonus = total 26 AC minimum (varies with higher DEX)<br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while

DROP THE SHIELD!  *fients*<br><br>I guess that's an option.  I'll have to go back and try it with the elf.  I'll let you know.
