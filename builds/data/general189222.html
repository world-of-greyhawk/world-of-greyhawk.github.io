I have a few questions regarding construct shapes and hope to get them cleared up here.<br><br>1.) Do weapons in general just count as not there when you shift into a construct shape?<br><br>2.) How about gloves? Do you retain either of these in the new shape or do you retain any bonuses from them might be a better question?<br><br>3.) Does focusing in unarmed strike still apply to a construct?<br><br>4.) In general what stats stay with you when you shift?<br><br>My son wants to play a shifter and I am working on making him one. I hope to have it up tomorrow and available for comments/help.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Pendragon

Well....IIRC <br><br>Construct shape overrides Str and Con only, Iron golem is by far the most useful construct form, an 8/8/4 split pre epic of druid/shifter/monk would be best if focusing on construct form and no others (for BAB reasons), starting with wisdom 17 or 18, then post epic taking 2 shifter levels followed by monk levels until about lv 26 or so, by which time you can probly take construct form on shifter lv 11.<br><br>Hope that helps

Regards item merging it really depends on the shifter scripts that are running where you play, Izz's shifter scripts and some others (i think) can be tweaked to allow full item merging for all forms, so in that case the kama (in main hand) and monk gloves would merge into the shifted form.
