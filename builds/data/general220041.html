I have been playing on a pvp persistant world lately. I find it very fun. However, I am looking to make a pick pocket.<br><br>I know, I know many people hate them, but on this server it is dog eat dog and I kept getting bitten by thieves. Since, I don't really care about killing them, I want to steal some of my stuff back from them. To me beating them at their own game is the challenge.<br><br>Everything in the book is available as far as classes and skills.<br><br>So, here is the challenge, build a thief with as much as possible in hide, move silently, spot, and pickpocket. Oh, and one or more levels in ShadowDancer for HiPs.<br><br>-Pendragon2u<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Pendragon2u on 11/11/05 23:45</span></i></p>

Apparently, you think that I enjoy the idea of stealing?<br><br>I don't.<br><br>I want to turn the game around on the looters.<br><br>I much more enjoy the building of better melee builds and concentrating on dueling it out on pvp servers.<br><br>However, to show you why I want a good Pickpocketer, I will give you an example of what happened to me just yesterday.<br><br>I went into an area with my melee boss killer and was jumped on by a group of players. During their attempt to kill me I was pickpocketed by 3 of the other parties members. I did die, but it took the lame players awhile to accomplish the feat, but they did manage to take alot of minor items from me in the process.<br><br>I then challenged them to one on one combat, only one of them took me up on the offer. In the middle of our fight, the rest of his crew appeared and repeated the entire process as before.<br><br>This is something that happens alot on the server. Yet, the server itself is not a bad place to play. I enjoy the challenge of beating on guys that do this stuff.<br><br>Now, I want to switch the tables and take stuff back from these people and only these people.<br><br>-Pendragon

Sup Dodgy.<br><br>Sorry I had to jet out on the leveling the other day.<br><br>Just a note here, I took Flipmo the Sprite and killed that Drow boss twice yesterday. I was gonna go try a dragon and that is when I got jumped by the party.<br><br>Anyway, I will email you on that build.<br><br>I did search the builds on here for a dex build for pickpocketing but I wasn't satisfied with what I saw. I could see that you could get more out of the skill than what was in the builds listed. If I can see it, and I am not a great builder, then the community as a whole should be able to really see it.<br><br>That is why I put this on the general boards. With this build I am willing to sacrifice all melee ability to gain as much skill as possible.<br><br>-Pendragon

I would do a halfling bard/sd.  depending on what items are available, you can get the perform skill up quite a bit, which in turn boosts all your skills.  This requires lots of bard levels.  bard also has all the skill necessary for pickpocketing. hide/move silent/pickpocket and bard as great dex and great cha as epic bonus feats.  <br><br>for example, if you get 30 bard levels and manage to get 100 perform you'll get +19 to hide, move silent and pickpocket (and all other skills).<br><br>Boost dex as much as you can. and Cha to get your perform higher (and you'll get bard spells like invis, etc... which can help with this).<br><br>you can also take 1 druid level to get the camoflage spell, which gives +10 to hide skill... might help out.  need to have 11 wis to cast it.<br><br>you'll want these feats: artist, stealthy, skill focus and epic skill focus in perform, hide, move silent, and pickpocket. you probably also want lasting inspiration, so you can sing far away from the "mark" and have the bonus last long enough to finish the robbery.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By jjjhhhlll on 11/17/05 20:39</span></i></p>

With a high enough Use Magical Device skill rank, you could cast that 1st level druid spell off a scroll.  I wouldn't take one druid level just for that.

good point if scroll are available, then you don't need the druid level. <br><br>another option is cleric levels, for trickery domain power.  you can get up to +19 to move silently, pickpocket, and hide if you take lots of cleric levels.  cleric doesn't have a good epic bonus feat list, so the bard may be better.  <br><br>cleric has a low number of skills too, so you might have to take away from dex to get enough int to get the desired skills.  The good thing about the trickery domain is that it is completely based of cleric levels.  So you don't need to invest skills and attributes into cha like you do with the bard version.

Bard/SD/COT could be effective if you don't care about doing damage.<br><br>24 bard levels, 10 SD levles, 6 COT levels.   This will qualify you for epic dodge and lasting inspiration, get you a bard song worth +12 to all skills if you have a high perform/use perform items, and give you reasonable saves and some bonus feats - all so if you do get caught, you aren't toast.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Bards have access to the "Silence" spell.  Can someone explain how the game would handle a half rogue/bard who casts silence upon himself?  Would he automatically make any silence checks?

Don't know about the silence spell, but I do know that it gives a very large visual clue of a white moving circle where the hidden person is, so it's a moot point if you want the element of suprise.
