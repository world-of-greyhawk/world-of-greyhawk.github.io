I'm definitely in a higher magic setting right now, at least 5+, but looking at some +7 or +8 stuff too.  No perma-haste, though, and some resistances here and there.<br><br>Any ideas on what build(s) will do well here?

How good would that be?<br><br>dude, the only way people can help you is if you know what you like to play (people who ask this type of question generally have no ideas).  In any world, CLERICS rule IF you can play them right, and from my experience, most cant.  Wizards and sorcs are amazingly powerful where the HP of a world arent way over the top, BUT you have to be able to use a caster effectively.  Melee characters are generally a safe bet anywhere (fighter, pal, ranger, etc) but you gotta like being a meat head (only one thing you can do is kill things).  Bards are amazing anywhere for the PRC availabilities and skill set and one of the best feats in the game (yes, I said it).  Rogues rule anywhere for pure damage possibility.  Barbarians, well...  <br><br>So, what do YOU like in a character? Range? melee? offensive casting?  Defensive ability?  Soloable? Party reliant?  Feat reliant?  Dexer? Strengther?  dev crit?  epic dodge or BOTH?  <br><br>THEN, instead of asking again, take a look with the search engine in our guild for some possible combos (no levels just to see what is available).  Then come back to us with ideas on what you find. THen we can point out the benefits/liabilities of your choices.<br><br>But,to save time, go with a 26cleric/4bard/ wither 10PM or 10 rdd.  For my money, those combos are possibly the strongest out there.  Then read my guide in our forum to understand how to mass kill with a cleric.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; -- Posted by Kail Pendragon  <br><br>Being hyperbolic is an integral part of Avado's being <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 04/15/09 23:09</span></i></p>

With <i>higher</i> magic items available the role of self buffing fades. Several class feats, immunities and high damage reductions become available on items. <br><br>Base AB can be increased by +26 from items. AC can be increased by +100 (20x5)!<br><br>In PvP it often ends with a "who can hit with a 20 roll, and will it do any damage"?<br><br>Dex based chars can generally have a higher AB and AC. A high AC, Epic dodge and perhaps Self Concealment will help them last longer. Weapons with lots of damage bonuses makes to some extent up for lack for brutish strength based damage.

Mick, i agree. That is not the type of environment that he is talking about though.  He said +6 is high.  +6 is not high.  YOu would be very hard pressed to find +6 with tons of junk on it, and if you do, there is something seriously wrong with the balance of that pw.<br><br>Yes, it is amazing when you get to some obscene magic that dexers become more valuable than even, dare i say, clerics... *faints*
