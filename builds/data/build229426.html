Iconic Arcane Archer (playable levels 1-40, PvM)<br><br>The Concept:  This is a "pure" Arcane Archer; that is, it takes 30 levels of the prestige class, and only uses one core class to qualify for them, as described in the Pure Builds thread ( <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13422", "227976", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> ).  I decided, in the spirit of iconicity (word?), to expound in this build upon something which is, to varying degrees, a strength of all AA builds:  Ridiculously high AB.  I think anyone will be satisfied that, whatever else may be said for the build, I have at the least achieved that.<br><br>-----<br><br>Race:  Elf<br><br>Alignment:  Any non-lawful<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>Str:  10<br>Dex:  20<br>Con:  10<br>Wis:  8<br>Int:  10<br>Cha:  14<br><br>1 - Bard 1 - Point Blank Shot<br>2 - Bard 2<br>3 - Bard 3 - Weapon Focus (longbow)<br>4 - Bard 4 - Dex 21<br>5 - Bard 5<br>6 - Bard 6 - Rapid Shot<br>7 - Bard 7<br>8 - Bard 8 - Dex 22<br>9 - AA 1 / Bard 8 - Weapon Finnesse<br>10 - AA 2 / Bard 8<br>11 - AA 3 / Bard 8<br>12 - Bard 9 / AA 3 - Improved Critical (longbow), Dex 23<br>13 - AA 4 / Bard 9<br>14 - AA 5 / Bard 9<br>15 - AA 6 / Bard 9 - Called Shot<br>16 - AA 7 / Bard 9 - Dex 24<br>17 - AA 8 / Bard 9<br>18 - AA 9 / Bard 9 - Toughness<br>19 - AA 10 / Bard 9<br>20 - Bard 10 / AA 10 - Dex 25<br><br>21 - AA 11 / Bard 10 - Epic Weapon Focus (longbow)<br>22 - AA 12 / Bard 10<br>23 - AA 13 / Bard 10<br>24 - AA 14 / Bard 10 - Great Dex 26, Great Dex 27*, Dex 28<br>25 - AA 15 / Bard 10<br>26 - AA 16 / Bard 10<br>27 - AA 17 / Bard 10 - Great Dex 29<br>28 - AA 18 / Bard 10 - Epic Prowess*, Dex 30<br>29 - AA 19 / Bard 10<br>30 - AA 20 / Bard 10 - Great Dex 31<br>31 - AA 21 / Bard 10<br>32 - AA 22 / Bard 10 - Great Dex 32*, Dex 33<br>33 - AA 23 / Bard 10 - Great Dex 34<br>34 - AA 24 / Bard 10<br>35 - AA 25 / Bard 10<br>36 - AA 26 / Bard 10 - Great Dex 35, Great Dex 36*, Dex 37<br>37 - AA 27 / Bard 10<br>38 - AA 28 / Bard 10<br>39 - AA 29 / Bard 10 - Great Dex 38<br>40 - AA 30 / Bard 10 - Great Dex 39*, Dex 40<br><br>Skills:  Discipline 22(22), Listen 40(41), Perform 13(15), Spellcraft 15(15), Spot 40(41), Tumble 20(35), UMD 23(25) (all skills +1 w/ Bard Song)<br><br>-----<br><br>Final Stats:<br>Str:  10<br>Dex:  40<br>Con:  10<br>Wis:  8<br>Int:  10<br>Cha:  14<br><br>AB (longbow):  +60/+55/+50/+45 (+58/+58/+53/+48/+43 with Rapid Shot, +1 within 15 feet, +2 w/ Bard Song)<br><br>Damage (longbow):  1d8+15 (+1 within 15 feet, +2 w/ Bard Song)<br><br>AC (robes):  29<br><br>Max HP:  340 (+8 w/ Bard Song)<br><br>Saves:<br>Fortitude:  20 (+1 w/ Bard Song, +3 vs. spells)<br>Reflex:  39 (+1 w/ Bard Song, +3 vs. spells)<br>Will:  19 (+1 w/ Bard Song, +3 vs. spells)<br><br>-----<br><br>Strengths:<br>-Absurdly high AB<br>-Good ranged damage that doesn't rely on sneak attacks, Divine Might, smite, critical hits, or any other less dependable means to be delivered<br>-High enough Enchant Arrow to get through all but the meanest DR (with +5 arrows, it'll even go through Epic Warding, I believe)<br>-Decent AC<br>-Very high reflex save<br>-Level 3 Bard spells (level 4 if you can get +4 to charisma)<br><br>Weaknesses:<br>-BORING!<br>-Low fortitude and will saves<br>-Mediocre HP<br>-No Improved Evasion to take advantage of the reflex save<br>-No Epic Dodge or SC (look at all that dexterity going to waste)<br><br>-----<br><br>Well...it is what it is.

I meant that if arrow enhancement stacks with enchant arrow, they'll count as +20 weapons, and Epic Warding gives DR 50/+20, so it wouldn't work against +20 weapons.  I wouldn't be surprised if I was wrong, though; I haven't tested it.

That sure would have been nice, but no, enhancement bonuses do not stack. Besides, unless I'm mistaken, Enchant Arrow only works if used with non-magical arrows. So, even if the bonuses would stack, you wouldn't end up with +20 arrows. Thus Epis Warding remains unbeaten... Arr...

I'll take your word for it that the enhancement bonuses don't stack for purposes of bypassing DR, but I'm pretty sure I remember that the damage bonus from my enchant arrow stacked with my magical ammunition when I played an AA build through HotU.  Maybe the character sheet lied, though; I probably wouldn't have noticed if it and my actual damage didn't match up.

Of course, a ranger/wizard/arcane archer would be a lot closer to the stereotypical arcane archer, but then it wouldn't be "pure".
