I would go something like 25 levels monk and 5 levels shadow dancer,,,,, you will stomp all the game breaking classes rely on abilities past 30 usually above 35 thats probably why your server stopped it at 30.<br><br>But ya go dex, if you want , i would and take weapon fenesse (spelling) for unarmed or mabye kamas but with this combo and played right for stealth so max ranks in hide and move silently you should slaughter....... a lot<br><br>dont forget your empty body ability and if ya can get defensive roll and all that neatness ,, and oh ya boost up your SR to stop those pesky mages that cant cast epic spells or have low Caster Levels

And the monk's speed, past lvl. 20, the speed will be always 150%, even much faster when hasted(item with haste properties on it). And by taking more monk levels, your SR will increase, however it also depends on the WIS I think(I can't remember at the moment), by having more WIS, you will have higher AC, SR, and Will. I recommend that you take more WIS than DEX, such like this you increase the WIS every time you are leveling up in Monk's class, but if you are in the SD class when you are increasing the ability, increase the DEX at that point. It should be well balanced, although the attack damage may be low...<br><br>I hope this helps you out...<br><br>Anuis

SR isn't dependent on wisdom, it uses a formula of 10+monk level.<br><br>Ac still improves, and you get monk bonus feats after 20.

Sure wisdom boosts your ac, so you should try and boost it with items etc.  However dex boosts your ac just as much, yet it increases your AB, which is always a problem for monks.  I'd probally go for a 20 monk/10 SD, which will let you get epic dodge.<br><br>A dwarf monk starting with<br>str 12<br>dex 18<br>con 12<br>int 10<br>wis 14<br>chr 6<br><br>First 20 levels monk, then 10 SD pumping dex the whole way.  Get weapon focus on unarmed strike, imp crit, weapon finesse and whatever else you want.  For epic levels get epic weapon focus, great dex, armor skin and epic dodge at lvl 30.<br>With unarmed strike you will have 1-20 +1(19-20) with 31/28/25/22/19 and 32 base ac.  With +5 gloves, robes and sun soul boots you will have 36/33/30/27/24 and 42 ac.  Max disc, hide, move silently and tumble and you will be a silent killing machine.

There is a level 30 PvP server I go to.  Perhaps we are going to the same one considering how few thereare (If there is actually more than just one.  I have never checked to see if there are any others).<br><br>As for good builds, I would say take as much of one class as you could to get the bonus Epic Feats via the class feats.  It might not hurt taking only one class, or all one class, then one level of another class (assuming the main class gets a bonus feat every 3 levels, that way you would get 29 levels, which turns into an extra three epic feats, last of which is granted at the 29th level).  So, keep in mind when and what epic feats you would gain.<br><br>An Arcane Archer, for example gets Greater Dex, whilst a Cleric gets Greater Wisdom.<br><br>If this is the server I am thinking of most people have a really high AC and a really low AB.  You can either try to get past their AC (which if they have a Tower Shield you would not be able to if they maxed their AC), or you could try to get more attacks than the other people, giving you a better chance to roll a 20.  Sad tactic, but it can work.<br><br>The way tog et a lot of attacks per round is by taking just 1 level Monk (after your first 20 levels so you get the highest BA, granting more attacks).  For the first 20 levels go for a class or classes that grant +1 to your BA every level (Fighter, Ranger, Barbarian, Champion or Torm, Blackguard, Weapon Master, and I few others I think).  Also, go for Ambedex, Two-Weapon, and Improved Two-Weapon Fighting (you can get those for free by taking 9 level Ranger so you would not have to spend points to get a dex of 15 which is needed for Ambedex).  By doing this you would get 7 attacks with your primary hand, and 2 attacks with your offhand (You have to be using Kamas though), this does not count the extra attack granted by Haste, or by the Monk feat Flurry of Blows, each of which grant you an extra attack per round (to a grand total of 11 attacks per round).

Can anyone help me building a paladin lvl 30? I don't know if it is a good idea to multiclass it or no. And what are the best skills to improve to play a good-natured hero with a two hands sword? Thanks in advance <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">
