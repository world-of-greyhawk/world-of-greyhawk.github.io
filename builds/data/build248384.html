Here is the final version of the Moor Stalker. The general strategy is stealth/ranged based. Here are the features of the build:<br><br>- Uses a combination of very high hide/move silently DCs and HiPS to completely avoid detection, with the exception of characters with True Seeing, of course. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">     <br><br>- Uses a longbow-based attack to avoid melee situations, since both AC and HPs will be slightly lower than ideal.<br><br>- Death attack is used in conjunction with ranged attacks to deal much more damage to the enemy. Also, for a little extra, two FEs are available to deal even more damage to the more commonly-encountered enemy types in your module.<br><br>- UMD and Set Trap are used to summon creatures from scrolls/wands and set traps to put some distance between you and the enemy.<br><br>- In case melee situations are unavoidable, uses a very high Tumble DC to get out of there fast and get out of sight. Also, Epic Dodge is taken as early as possible with this build (level 27) to automatically negate the first attack.<br><br>As you might have guessed, the strategy for this build is very straightforward: Sneak into range of the enemy, get a DA from your ranged attack, and hide before they even get a chance to turn around to see what hit them. You could call this a sort of "sniper build," since the idea is to kill the enemy without them knowing where the attack is coming from. In case you yourself are ambushed (which is highly unlikely), tumble out of danger and hide to turn the tables around. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">      Even with large groups of enemies, this works very effectively.<br><br>Now, onto the build. As certain things come up in the build, I will make important notes in bold:<br><br>Moor Stalker v2.0 (Ranger 5/Assassin 25/SD 10)<br><br>Race: Elf<br>Alignment: Any Evil<br><b>Playable: 1-40 PvM</b><br><br>Stats: (Start/End)<br><br>Str 12/12<br>Dex 18/34<br>Con 10/10<br>Wis 12/12<br>Int 14/14<br>Cha 8/ 8<br><br><b>(Increase Dex every 4th level, of course)</b><br><br>Leveling:<br><br>01: Ranger(1): Weapon Finesse, Favored Enemy:<b>(insert FE here)</b>, {Dual Wield}<br>02: Ranger(2)<br>03: Ranger(3): Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>04: Ranger(4): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br>05: Ranger(5): Favored Enemy:<b>(insert FE here)</b><br><br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">     <b>(Make sure by this level that both Hide and Move Silently have 8 ranks)</b> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">    <br><br>06: Assassin(1): Dodge<br>07: Assassin(2): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>08: Assassin(3): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>09: Assassin(4): Mobility<br><br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">     <b>(Make sure by this level that Hide has 10 ranks, and Tumble has 5 ranks.

In case you come across lots of enemies with True Seeing, PBS helps with melee encounters, since they won't get attacks of opportunity. Other than that, I think I pretty much covered everyting. Please, feel free to add criticism, ask questions, and make comments on this build.<br><br><i>(Thanks again to FinneousPJ, Cinnabar Din, Bromium, Nimueh_Leafbow, and Mithradates for their help in editing and giving me suggestions on my first build.
