I wanted to make a build, for one of the servers I play at, and I wanted him to be a Shadow Dragon.  Shadows Dragons as you know can jump from the Plane of Shadows to ours back and forth, and are basically very sneaky.<br><br>So, I wanted to know if a, Sorcerer/RDD/SD, or a Bard/RDD/SD, would be best?  Possibly a Level Progression, Abilities, and such.  I wanted to get an Uber build, for the reason it's going to start out soooo slow.  Considering, Bards/Sorcerors, aren't a good starting class usually.  And I'll have to have atleast 5 levels of either to take RDD, and several levels higher to get SD, since H/MS isn't a class skill, or is it a Bard Class skill? Hmm...Well, either way.<br><br>Help!<br>_________________<br>~Blake~

For a good final build of nearly the same concept, try drui14monk SD with enough monk levels to get ki-strike5 and enough SD to get shadow evade, making the dragonshape look like an inky black disappearing mountain of death. This build is large, allowing for an easy flatfooted knockdown followed by a ton of medium damage attacks (probably good to get improved disarm preepic) before fading into the dark again. Hard to hit, tough as nails and able to dish plenty of damage. Only another dragonshape or arcane archer would be able to take you with good enough a player.

Bard does get H/MDS as class skills.<br>However for what you want a Druid/Shadowdancer is much better<br>Problem is picking the 3rd class.<br>Shifter works ok but if you rally want to focus on Dragonshape then Rogue or Assasain is probably best<br>Rogue makes getting Shadowdancer a lot easier but Assasain has less duplication of abilities with Shadowdancer<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

Monk has hide &amp; move silent enough to qualify for SD. Pre epic would be something like: druid to 4, then 4 monk, then 4 SD and whatever you like afterward. Zen archery early on makes it easier to level. All you have to remember is to keep pumping wisdom and to take feats that enhance stealth along the way.
