I have been working on a build or two that I think would be interesting to post.  A quick question, is there any software that would let me do builds without taking a charcter in the game and actually working it up levels?  Some type of database or excel system?<br><br>If there were my life would be alot easier.<br><br><br>Marduk

I asked this before and it seems that the answer is no. You have to level them in-game.

I am not sure why you would ask?   Is there some reason NOT to use a mod to lvl your character?  It seems to me that this is the most accurate way as nwn is not exactly like any other game out there (d+d included).  It has its own rules that change with updates (like the ones that occured since your original post).<br><br>Peace

Well, I can think of a few reasons...you wouldn't have to have NWN installed on the computer you wanted to try building a character on (like while at work).  If it was a spreadsheet type thing, you might be able to go back and fix a feat error directly instead of having to delevel all the way back to the mistake and all the way back up.  There are a number of reasons why something like that would be nice.  And there haven't been all that many changes since HotU that changed what feats/skills you could or couldn't take.  Fixes to the way feats/spells/skills work would be largely irrelevant for a program solely used for planning out a build.  As long as the prereqs are right, you should be ok.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 04/19/05 01:42</span></i></p>

All i can suggest is this: either learn the game mechanics so you can do it without the pc (like some of us have done) or make a program on your own!  All i can say is: I HOPE IM NOT YOUR BOSS!  Playing games at work!  What has this world come to?

Lol, work was just an example (although as a biology grad student, I do actually have sufficient downtime in lab while things are incubating to do that if I really wanted to).  Personally I do it as you suggest (i.e. manually based on knowing the mechanics by heart mostly), but I can still see the value of such a program.  Unfortunately, I doubt one will be made.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 04/19/05 17:17</span></i></p>

How many millions features would this require? I have a character build thingy that generates pages for my character builds but it's pretty *** code atm as I just add to it as I go.. it's tough to predict everything and i've had to overhall the AB calculating code several times for small things.. The program would only work well if we had several class specialists each inputting seperate classes things and a generalist who could do stuff like Toughness and other stuff..<br><br>-DaMouse

There's actually a LETO based program that can spit out very nice looking character build pages from a .bic file.  The PRC uses it for the builds on their site.  You might find that useful, DaMouse.<br><br>Steve

Doing the building in imagiation isnt that difficult really.  Well I use good old fashioned pen and paper first.  But anyway, all you have to remember is that you get a feat every 3 levels and a stat increase every 4, then you have to have a semi decent memory of the prestice classes and class bonus feats and you are halfway there.<br><br>In all honesty its best making any character build with/in a character building module anyway, for conformation that it works if nothing else.

DaMouse: As far as I know, it's not been officially released.  If you go to the <a href="http://nwnprc.netgamers.co.uk" target="_blank">PRC Page</a> and look at the character builds section, there is an email link to the author at the bottom of each build (plus it will let you see what the pages look like).  You could probably get a copy from him.<br><br>Mike: Yeah, that's basically what I do...sketch out what feats I need and have room for and a rough order, and then make sure it works before posting.
