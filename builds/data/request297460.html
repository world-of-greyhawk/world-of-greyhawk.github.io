Can anyone make a good Fighter/Druid/Shifter build that get's 40 AB(if possible) in Lizardfolk form that'll still get both Weapon Spec. and Epic Weapon Spec. Oh yeah, it'll use whips. If you're going to sacrifice some spell power, be my guest. Bull Strenth and Blood Frenzy are the only thing that matters to me. Kai?<br><br>(I'll appreciate it too if the base AB, unshifted, is also 40. Again, IF possible)

I don't know much about shifter shapes, so I'll take <a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Humanoid_shape" target="_blank">this</a> as my base.<br><br>First thing off, I believe you mean you want the Epic Lizardfolk whipmaster, so much worth it than the regular one.<br><br>That's a STR of 21 and a +5 enhanced weapon as base. 40 AB -4 from EF, EWF and EP, -5 STR, -5 enhancement = 26 BAB. I can tell you right now, having an AB of 40 is easy.<br><br>Now, attaining the Lizardfolk soon should be important for playability. If you don't care about getting it up to level 40 inform so and you could gain +3 BAB.<br><br>In order to have 16 pre-epic BAB you need to take a Fighter 8 / Druid 5 / Shifter 7 spread, after that another 2 Fighter for EWS, another 10 Shifter for Epic Human Shapes and fill in the other 8 levels with Druid to end with a Fighter 10 / Druid 13 / Shifter 17. At least that's how I envision it. There you have it, 40 AB unbuffed<br><br>Having 40 AB unshifted is more difficult, I never suggest to increase base STR score on a shifter type, since your stats will change to the shifts', it's a waste IMO, so I'd pump up CON, if you choose to take Fighter levels you can go for Epic Damage Reduction (only useful if your enemies can breach the shape's 15/+5 DR). For a shift that overrides both STR and DEX I'd leave them both at 8 to boost WIS, INT and CON.<br><br>With that spread you'll be capable of using a Bear shape since level 5, and the Lizard shape as soon as level 12, so even without any base stat scores it's very playable once you get to level 5. There is no point in having unshifted combat stats IMO, that's why I make it important to reach the shapes soon, once you get the shape you won't fight unshifted, shifts last too long, there's no need to de-shift.<br><br>In case that 40 AB unshifted is so necessary,  it'd be easier to go the high BAB route with 16 Fighter levels and 4 Druid pre-epic with a final spread of Fighter 18 / Druid 5 / Shifter 17, it has more AB, but you won't get any shift until epics.<br><br>I can make a build spread for you, but tell me which you prefer, my ideas are: Fighter 10 / Druid 13 / Shifter 17 or Fighter 18 / Druid 5 / Shifter 17.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 06/07/08 20:31</span></i></p>
