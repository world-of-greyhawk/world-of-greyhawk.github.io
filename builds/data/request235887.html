I've just purchased Pirates of the Sword Coast and wanted to make a dex-based warrior (primarily dual-wielder) to run through it with (and beyond to HOTU perhaps).<br><br>I wanted a meleer because I can't be bother figuring out a whole pile of spells and special abilities and I wanted dex-based because I just think it is terribly in character for a pirate!<br><br>These are some points that I need to be addressed:<br><br>1. Uncanny Dodge. No point having a high dex-based AC if it disappears every once in a while. (Barb2,Rogue3,Assas2,SD2)<br><br>2. Need to bump up weapon damage since STR effects will be minimal and weapon will be light.<br> - Sneak attack? (Rogue,Assas,BG)<br> - Weapon specialisation? (Fighter4)<br> - CHA-focussed feats like Divine [wrath,shield,might] - the CHA synergy in these classes may also help improve saving throws (BG,COT,Cleric?)<br> - Favoured ememies (Ranger)<br><br>3. Would prefer an elf or halfling for DEX bonus, but will be satisfied with human for extra feat and skills (or dwarf/half orc) to avoid XP penalty.<br><br>4. Would want to take KD/IKD to allow for as many hits as possible. Death attack could work too.<br><br>5. Not planning to go for Dev Crit or to get WM class. Would like to have enough damage coming from normal attacks (lots of them where possible) rather than rely on sneaks and / or crits (which too many bosses are immune to!)<br><br>Here are some ideas I have had, please comment. And note, I am not specifically after builds, just ideas for one (though if you can point me to an existing one I would welcome that).<br><br>* Ranger (high level) / BG / Assassin: this has not been done according to the search engine so I could earn points for originality. No Weapon Spec, Ranger helps get the Assassin prereqs better than fighter and no XP penalty.<br><br>* Fighter / Barb / BG - no spells at all. Rage would help with damage, though it seems a waste in a DEX build.<br><br>* Fighter / Ranger / Assassin - no CHA feats, saves could be low, but favoured enemies plus WS.<br><br>* Fighter / Rogue / [COT or BG]<br><br>* Ranger / Rogue / [COT or BG]<br><br>* Barbarian / Rogue / COT<br><br>* Barbarian / Ranger / BG<br><br><br>Any other bright ideas? At this stage I am leaning towards R/A/BG as it seems to have not been done before and I am all for trying something new!<br><br>Shayne<br>_________________<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13422", "227976", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pure Class Builds</a>

Try <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "231800", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Monastic Commando</a>, human, EWS, dual wielding kamas for 8 base att/round, IKD, ED, Crippling Strike, Skill Mastery, Slippery Mind, great skillset. It gets what counts early enough. And no XP penalty even with 3 base classes.<br><br>Otherwise the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225147", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Stealthy Blade of Doom</a> in one of its versions: it's a halfling sneaker, ED, SC5, 49 AB. Remember not to pick IWWA since it doesn't work with sneaks. It has WM though. Why you'd rather not pick WM? Enough WM levels sensibly increase your AB.<br><br>A Cleric/Rogue/SD maybe? Cleric 26/Rogue 13/SD 1 is a nice combo.<br><br>Barbarian's not a waste in a dex build if you ask my opinion, you could try that route.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

You could use a Dwarven Defender, Defensive Awareness covers your DEX like Uncanny, and you can't be flanked, Fighter/DD/Cleric could be good.

I would probably go Fighter/Rogue/SD for a nice piratey feel. Halfling, dwarf, or human will work with no XP penalties. From 4-8 fighter levels pre-epic, depending on what feats you want, up to the next even fighter level in epic for EWS. One SD level at level 21 for HiPS. Lots of rogue levels for skills and sneak damage. If you plan to do HotU be sure to pick up Epic Dodge before level 27.<br><br>If you don't want HiPS, or do want to use monk for more attacks per round, you can also try Felonius Monk: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225896", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>TM
