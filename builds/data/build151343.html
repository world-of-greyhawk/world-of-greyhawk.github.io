Would appreciate comments and criticisms.

You will save 3 feats and end up with a higher AB, and since you won't need Dex to start out with, you could use the extra points to get Con and Cha to 14.  I would definitely recommend you get Divine Shield to help you boost your AC, and move Great Cleave and Imp. Crit: Rapier down into pre-epic lvls.  I would probably drop the longbow since it's a Str-based build and use those feats for something else as well.<br><br>An alternative to that would be to go Dex-based and get Epic Dodge.  You could definitely do this with your build, and it would allow you to use longbow as well as Rapier.  I would probably choose Halfling for race, and change you starting stats to look something like this:<br><br>STR 10<br>DEX 18<br>CON 16<br>CHA 8<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br><br>You would also need to change you lvls a bit since you need both Defensive Roll and Improved Evasion in order to get Epic Dodge.  Going Rogue 14/BG 25/SD1 would accomplish this, but if you went Rogue 17/BG 22/SD1 you could get Crippling Strike as well, and your sneak attacks now become 9d6 Rogue + 7d6 BG = 16d6, rather than the 14d6 you had previously.  Pump all attribute points into Dex and take a couple Great Dex feats and you can get the 30 Dex you need for Self Concealment, although I probably wouldn't bother as I don't really think it's worth the feats.

Thanks for the comments. Yes, the +2 to saves and other BG bennies from higher CHA would be nice.<br><br>A couple questions:<br>1. Halfling will be less effective with knockdown, which is crucial to the disabling attack, as well as losing on strength that will decrease damage from both a mighty bow and melee attacks &amp; make devcrit more difficult or impossible.  How 'bout an elf instead?<br>2. I assume you would recommend a weapon finesse feat?<br><br>This puts me down 2 feats, 1 from non-human, 1 for WF -- okay if I can figure out where to take them from.<br><br>Thanx,<br><br>Falconhurst<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Falconhurst on 09/02/04 02:23</span></i></p>

I dont see any of the weapon focus for the two weapons you have chosen to go dev crit.

Not to fear, lads.  This build, in addition to being 2 years old, is borked in a number of ways.
