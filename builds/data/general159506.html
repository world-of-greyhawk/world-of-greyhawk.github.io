I'm playing with a zen archery build and I've noticed that monsters are getting attacks of oppurtunity against me. I have taken point blank shot but that doesn't have anything to do with attacks of oppurtunity. I also have spring attack which negates attacks of oppurtunity from running around in combat.<br><br>Also I noticed that when I cast buffs during combat they got attacks of oppurtunity as well. I was just wondering if this is normal because with another char when I duel archers and casters I don't remember getting attacks of oppurtunity against them. Maybe I wasn't paying as much attention as I am now but I just wanted to get some input from other people.

I think it matters what level of difficulty the Mod is set to.  Hard difficulty should activate AoOs on archers when in melee.
