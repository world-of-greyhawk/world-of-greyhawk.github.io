<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>I posted this character on excellent character builds thread in the spoilers forum on the 12th. But with the popularity of Puff, I figured I'd post him here. I'm on my notebook, which doesn't have NWN installed, so I can't check his final stats, I'll post them tomorrow. Still he has 8 attacks in dragon form and access to all levels of druid spells.<br><br>In Dragon form you get: the monk AC bonus from WIS, the epic weapon spec. (unarmed) damage bonus, the extra unarmed attacks and flurry of blows. The high wisdom also helps with stunning fist, and with zen archery the character is a pretty good archer. The monk levels also give you improved evasion. I can't remember the final stats in dragon form, but it was one very nasty dragon.<br><br>All attribute increases go to WIS, except for the last one that goes to STR.<br><br>Level 1 Human LN, Monk<br>Base Attributes<br>STR 13<br>DEX 13<br>CON 10<br>WIS 16<br>INT 14<br>CHA 10<br>Feats: toughness, luck of heroes<br><br>Level 2 Fighter 1/Monk 1<br>Feat: weapon focus (unarmed)<br><br>Level 3 Fighter 2/Monk 1<br>Feats: zen archery, point blank shot<br><br>Level 5 Fighter 4/Monk 1<br>Feat: weapon specialization (unarmed)<br><br>Level 6 Fighter 5/Monk 1<br>Feat: weapon focus (longbow)<br><br>Level 7 Fighter 6/Monk 1<br>Feat: weapon specialization (longbow)<br><br>Level 9 Fighter 8/Monk 1<br>Feats: rapid shot, power attack<br><br>Level 11 Fighter 10/Monk 1<br>Feat: improved power attack<br><br>Level 12 Fighter 11/Monk 1<br>Feat: expertise<br><br>Level 13 Fighter 12/Monk 1<br>Feat: improved expertise<br><br>Level 15 Fighter 12/Monk 3<br>Feat: disarm<br><br>Level 18 Fighter 12/Monk 4/Druid 2<br>Feat: great cleave<br><br>Level 21 Fighter 13/Monk 4/Druid 4<br>Feat: epic weapon focus (unarmed)<br><br>Level 22 Fighter 14/Monk 4/Druid 4<br>Feat: epic weapon specialization (unarmed)<br><br>Level 24 Fighter 14/Monk 4/Druid 6<br>Feat: great wisdom I<br><br>Level 27 Fighter 14/Monk 4/Druid 9<br>Feat: great wisdom II<br><br>Level 30 Fighter 14/Monk 4/Druid 12<br>Feat: great wisdom III<br><br>Level 33 Fighter 14/Monk 4/Druid 15<br>Feat: great wisdom IV<br><br>Level 36 Fighter 14/Monk 6/Druid 16<br>Feat: great wisdom V<br><br>Level 39 Fighter 14/Monk 8/Druid 17<br>Feat: dragon shape<br><br>Level 40 Fighter 14/Monk 9/Druid 17<br><br>Final Attributes<br>STR 14<br>DEX 13<br>CON 10<br>WIS 30<br>INT 14<br>CHA 10<br><br>273 Skill points, suggested use<br>Discipline 43<br>Tumble 40<br>Spell Craft 40<br>Persuade 43<br>Hide 43<br>Move Silently 43<br>Animal Empathy 21<br>_________________<br>If at first you don't succeed, avoid skydiving.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/26/08 08:03</span></i></p>

Because the epic weapon specialization, weapon specialization, weapon focus and epic weapon focus don't work in dragon form most of the advantages of this build don't apply.  I designed Sir Smokesalot as a replacement to this character.  I think that the latter is a much better build.
