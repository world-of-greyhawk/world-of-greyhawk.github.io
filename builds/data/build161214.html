People who are looking for a monk build, which is both interesting and effective to play with, in both single or multiplayer modes will find this build very efficient. The build has been optimized so that game play from level one to level forty will be balanced. Although, i have two other slightly different variations from this build, i think this one is the most effective. Anyone interested in the other builds should let me know and i will post them too.<br><br>Level 1 Monk Human(any lawful)<br>Strength:    14(18)<br>Dexterity:   13(14)<br>Constitution:14(21)<br>Wisdom:      14(18)<br>Intelligence:13(13)<br>Charisma:    10(10)<br>Concentration 4, Discipline 4, Heal 4, Parry 4,<br>Persuade 4, Tumble 4.<br>Dodge, Mobility<br>*Cleave, *Evasion, *Flurry of Blows,<br>*Improved Unarmed Strike, *Monk AC Bonus,<br>*Quick to Master, *Stunning Fist,<br>*Weapon Proficiency(Monk)<br><br>Level 2 Monk<br>Discipline 1, Parry 1, Intimidate 1,<br>Persuade 1, Tumble 1.<br>*Deflect Arrows<br><br>Level 3 Fighter<br>Discipline 1, Parry 1, Intimidate 1,<br>Expertise, Weapon Focus(Greatsword)<br>*Armor Proficiency(Heavy), *Armor Proficiency(Medium),<br>*Armor Proficiency(Light), *Shield Proficiency,<br>*Weapon Proficiency(Martial), *Weapon Proficiency(Simple)<br><br>Level 4 Monk<br>Strength 1<br>Discipline 1, Parry 1, Persuade 2, Tumble 2.<br>*Monk Speed, *Still Mind<br><br>Level 5 Fighter<br>Discipline 1, Parry 1, Intimidate 1,<br>Spring Attack<br><br>Level 6 Monk<br>Intimidate 1, Persuade 2, Tumble 2.<br>Whirlwind Attack<br><br>Level 7 Weapon Master<br>Spot 4,<br>*Ki Damage, *Weapon of Choice(Greatsword)<br><br>Level 8 Weapon Master<br>Strength 1<br>Spot 4,<br><br>Level 9 Weapon Master<br>Discipline 4,<br>Improved Critical(Greatsword)<br><br>Level 10 Weapon Master<br>Spot 4,<br><br>Level 11 Weapon Master<br>Discipline 2, Spot 2,<br>*Increased Multiplier,<br>*Superior Weapon Focus<br><br>Level 12 Monk<br>Wisdom 1<br>Tumble 6.<br>Blind Fight<br>*Purity of Body<br><br>Level 13 Monk<br>Parry 6,<br>*Knockdown, *Improved Knockdown<br><br>Level 14 Monk<br>Parry 3, Persuade 1, Tumble 2<br>*Wholeness of Body<br><br>Level 15 Weapon Master<br>Discipline 4<br>Iron Will<br><br>Level 16 Weapon Master<br>Wisdom 1<br>Spot 4,<br>*Ki Critical<br><br>Level 17 Weapon Master<br>Discipline 2, Spot 2<br><br>Level 18 Weapon Master<br>Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 2<br><br>Level 19 Weapon Master<br>Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 4<br><br>Level 20 Monk<br>Parry 3, Persuade 4, Tumble 3<br><br>Level 21 Monk<br>Parry 2, Tumble 4<br>Great Constitution I<br>*Improved Evasion, *Epic Character<br><br>Level 22 Monk<br>Parry 3, Persuade 2, Tumble 1<br>*Ki Strike +1<br><br>Level 23 Weapon Master<br>Discipline 4<br>*Epic Weapon Master<br><br>Level 24 Weapon Master<br>Constitution 1<br>Spot 4<br>Great Constitution II<br><br>Level 25 Weapon Master<br>Discipline 2, Spot 2<br>Epic Weapon Focus(Greatsword)<br>*Epic Superior Weapon Focus<br><br><br>Level 26 Weapon Master<br>Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 2<br><br><br>Level 27 Weapon Master<br>Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 4<br>Great Constitution III<br><br><br>Level 28 Monk<br>Constitution 1<br>Tumble 6, Parry 4<br>*Diamond Body<br><br><br>Level 29 Weapon Master<br>Discipline 2, Spot 2<br>Armor Skin<br><br><br>Level 30 Weapon Master<br>Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 2<br>Great Constitution IV<br><br><br>Level 31 Weapon Master<br>Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 4<br><br>Level 32 Monk<br>Constitution 1<br>Parry 6, Tumble 4<br>*Diamond Soul<br><br>Level 33 Weapon Master<br>Discipline 2, Spot 2<br>Great Wisdom I<br>Epic Prowess<br><br>Level 34 Weapon Master<br>Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 2<br><br>Level 35 Weapon Master<br>Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 4<br><br>Level 36 Weapon Master<br>Strength 1<br>Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 6<br>Great Wisdom II<br>Epic Damage Reduction I<br><br>Level 37 Weapon Master<br>Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 8<br><br>Level 38 Weapon Master<br>Discipline 1, Spot 1, Save 10<br><br>Level 39 Monk<br>Parry 7, Persuade 4, Tumble 5<br>Epic Damage Reduction II<br>*Ki Strike +2<br><br>Level 40 Weapon Master<br>Strength 1<br>Discipline 2, Spot 2<br>Epic Damage Reduction III<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Amzard on 10/26/04 06:01</span></i></p>

Tried it out briefly this morning and it seems pretty effective... not to mention, very cool looking to have a character with angel wings in robes wielding a burning greatsword. ::cackle::<br><br>What's the reason for not picking up more Fighter levels and getting Weapon Specialization / Epic Weapon Specialization?

I agree. Why not go 13/5/23? The +6 damage is very nice and adds to any build. This one needs it too because it won't have full d10 hit points, so it will need to kill enemies quickly. The 5 fighter gives an extra feat too, which is never a bad thing.

The combination Monk 14/ Fighter 4/ Weapon Master /22 is much better than Monk 13/ Fighter 5/ Weapon Master /22, because with the 14 monk levels his spell resistance increases by one and he gets more skill points at the expense of 2 hit points reduction(not that this is very important). I prefer the Monk 13/ Fighter 2/ Weapon Master /25 because from all effective combinations, the cost of picking the weapon specialization and epic weapon specialization is the loss of two other important feats such as armor skin and epic prowess (remember the epic weapon master gets a bonus feat every three levels). Also his attack bonus with his chosen weapon is reduced by 1. I weighed the options and decided that the damage, which the character already deals out is sufficient (due to the greatsword being held as a two-handed weapon) and chose to make the character more difficult to hit and impove the character's hit ability. The monk 14/ fighter 4 /weapon master 22 build is only more effective if the epic damage reduction feats are removed and the constitution dropped to 14. The extra ability points are allocated to both strength and wisdom. I have another character, which i call the spirit warrior, with this particular abilities. I will post it tomorrow, so you guys can try it out.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Amzard on 10/28/04 03:04</span></i></p>

By the way, the Blade monk has the epic damage resistance III feat, which grants him a 9/- damage resistance. In order words, the character can shrug off 9 points of damage from every hit.

By taking Con to 21 and spending 3 feats you get extra HP and DR/9. However by spending points in STR instead you would get better AB and more damage, and could also use the Fi4 build to get 6 more points of damage per hit, and of course the Crit feats beckon.<br><br>I get the feeling that this build spreads its stats around too thinly.<br><br>Maybe if you start with a Dwarf you could get a Mo/DD/WM build that would get you the DR without having to put all those points in Con.

Thorsson64, what you said is quite right. However, you have to look at the reason for the Blade Monk build. The character is meant to be a balance between the monk and the weapon master classes. It is not meant to be a replica of a weapon master. I think you might want to check out my spirit warrior build. That build should be more to your liking. I will try the combination with the dwarven defender and see how it turns out. Thanks for the suggestion.<br><br>By the way, at level 18 the Blade Monk gets the great fortitude feat. Sorry guys i forgot to include it in the post.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Amzard on 11/01/04 08:57</span></i></p>

I thought, when I saw Monk13 and WM25 that this was more Blade than Monk... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>I generally think that with Monk you either take low levels (1, 6 or maybe 9 at a stretch), or you take at least 20 to get the full set of feats and a decent SR.<br><br>Of course this is not a bad build, you do get SR23 by going to 13 in Monk. And I like the Blade, I get sick of dual Kama wielding Monks...<br><br>I've tried a similar builds, with 6 and 9 Monk levels, e.g. Mo9/F6/WM25 and Mo6/F6/WM28, but I generally look to get good AC, IKD and Dev Crit.
