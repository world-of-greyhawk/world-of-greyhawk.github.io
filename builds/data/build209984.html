<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 PvM</b><br><br><b>Wicked Acolyte</b> (Monk 10/Blackguard 25/SD 5)<br><br>Here is another Monk build that I had on 'paper'. I've actually leveled this one up to 40 on a PW and found she was great fun to play. The degree of wickedness that could be roleplayed is inspiring <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  <br><br>I used Pulse Cap's search engine and found only one other combination of these classes: kreestopearq's Kama Ghost (Monk 8/BG 16/SD 16) <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "143755", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>In that build, he pushes for Self Concealment, so it's quite a different build than mine.<br><br>The 25 levels of Blackguard provide solid melee presence as well as a summoned sidekick to help create Sneak Attacks. In addition, they permit Heavy Armor to be worn if one feels the character is not yet ready to step out of her 'shell' and go scrap wearing only robes.<br><br>The five levels of Shadow Dancer provide HIPS and Defensive Roll, and coupled with the Monk levels permit Epic Dodge to be taken as early as character level 24.<br><br>The early Monk levels bring Cleave, Evasion, Monk Speed, Flurry of Blows (with the weapon of choice - kama)and Improved Knockdown, while of course the final level of Monk permits one to maximize Tumble for AC benefit.<br><br><br><br>Classes:	Monk 10/BG 25/SD 5	<br>Race:	Human	<br>Alignment:	Lawful Evil	<br><br>Stats	(start/finish)	<br>Str	14	<br>Dex	18/32	<br>Con	12	<br>Int	12	<br>Wis	8	<br>Cha	8	<br><br>1	Monk 1	Power Attack, Ambidexterity<br>2	Monk 2	<br>3	Monk 3	Wpn Finesse<br>4	Monk 4	<br>5	Monk 5	<br>6	Monk 6	Dodge<br>7	Monk 7	<br>8	Monk 8	<br>9	BG 1	Mobility<br>10	SD 1	<br>11	BG 2	<br>12	SD 2	Two Wpn Fighting<br>13	BG 3	<br>14	BG 4	<br>15	BG 5	Imp.

Blackguards, Blackguards and more Blackguards.  There are never enough, really.  Pretty stout Epic Dodger, too Kal.<br><br>You have Power Attack taken at Monk1.  Perhaps an oversight on your part, but you can drop that right away.  You could then take Blindfighting, or move Toughness into that slot and open up an Epic Feat, take EWF on a General, push Epic Fiend down to BG16, and then take either Improved Sneak at BG25 or Epic Toughness.  Or just take an ESF: Taunt or something in place of Toughness and leave everything where it's at.  Me, I would probably just take Blindfighting at Monk1.<br><br>It also looks like you sold yourself short on Hit points.  He should have way more than 414, or is that your roll average?  250 for BG + 120 for Monk/SD + 40 for Con, +40 for Toughness, +40 for Epic Toughx2 = 490.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
