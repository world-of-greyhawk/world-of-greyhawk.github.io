With 7 Bard lvls and only 12 Cha, you will be able to cast 2nd lvl Bard spells, no more.  You do however get 4th lvl Ranger spells, so maybe that's what you meant. <br><br> I'm not entirely certain why you start with 16 Dex and 8 Cha; it would be more efficient to start with 15 Dex and 10 Cha as it would give you 1 more att. point to play around with.  Also not sure why you choose to go high Dex AND high Str; you don't need the Dex for any feats, but if you pumped more into Str you could get higher damage and AB.  I would start with 14 Dex, 12 Int, and 10 Cha, and pump all points into Str.  With +10 from leveling as well as +8 from RDD, you should be able to get to 32 base Str without taking any Great Str feats.  <br><br>If you substitute Empower Spell for Dodge, you can now cast Empowered Cat's Grace which will get you anywhere from +3 to +8 to your Dex ((1d4 +1) * 1.5).  Min (1+1) * 1.5 = 3, Max (4+1) * 1.5 = 7.5, ~8.  With an item that gives you +Dex (say around +5), you should fairly easily be able to get to 22 Dex, which will give you the +6 Dex bonus that is the max assuming you are wearing leather armor.  If you can get your Dex to 26 then you can wear padded armor and get your AC one point higher to +9, which is the max you can get wearing armor.    <br><br>So, if you get rid of the 2 Great Cha feats you have 2 more feats to play with.  Epic Prowess would be a good choice, as well an Epic Skill Focus in Taunt, which you now have the skill credits for, due to the fact that you started with another 2 points of Int.  <br>   <br>Also, your AB seems to be hurting due to the way you take your levels pre-epic.  It looks like you're going Ranger 9/Bard 1/RDD 10 pre-epic, which will give you a pre-epic BAB of 16.  Although this is enough for 4 attacks per round, you could do better.  If you went pure Ranger for the first 20 lvls, you would have a +20 base AB at lvl 40, as opposed to the +16 you are getting now.  If you throw in 4 lvls of Bard, you lose 1 point of AB, and if you throw in 4 lvls of RDD you lose another point of AB.  It seems that you are taking your RDD lvls pre-epic in order to get Dev. Crit. as soon as possible, but this is definitely watering down your AB.  A good compromise would be to go Ranger 12/Bard 4/RDD 4 pre-epic.  Your pre-epic BAB would be +18, and you could get Dev. Crit. by lvl 27 provided that you pumped all your points into Str and took RDD lvls from 21-26.    <br><br>With 32 base Str and +2 base AB, this character gains 5 points total to AB.  That's a fairly significant gain for a fairly small loss: you have to rearrange some stuff, and you lose 6 points of Dex, or effectively 2-3 points of AC.  In addition, you gain the ability to effectively Taunt your opponents if you want to, or you can spend the extra skill credits in other places.

I start with the Dex because as a ranger I need to stay in light or no armor for the dual wield. I wanted to get a decent AC throughout the characters 1-40 level progress. The Cha was a mistype. It is 14. I could do more STR and less dex, but I felt this was a more optimal route. I wouldn't go less than 16 Dex, and the 20 Dex not only nets me an extra +2 AC, but another +2 on reflex saves. Also with maxed UMD, I am most likely going to be wearing monk robes for haste. I might consider dropping Dex back to 16, but I'll have to toy around with it a bit. Fact was, there wan't much for feat selection left that I really had to have in the low 30s.<br><br>As for my leveling order, I did it the way I did so that I could get an Int boost early for more skill points, as well as being able to get Dev crit when I did.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

What is the BAB on this char and the AC and saves?
