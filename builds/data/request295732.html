I've been playing such builds numerous times, and it's highly playable, It's often the build I use to go with on new servers, taking the Cleric 9/Fighter 1 to access level 5 spells, then take some levels in DwD after that getting to level 20 as Cleric12/Fighter1/DwD7. That's a PvM build used to scout out new servers. I've played a Cleric14/CoT4/DwD22 build on a server with bonus spellslot items once, but felt it became somewhat lacking. Sorry for all the blabbering so far, I'm just being me. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I'd like some discussion on this combo.<br>Server: No spell- or feat changes except no dev-crit.<br>Mid-magic server(Base upon +5 items, and  +6 to stats)<br><br><b>I'd prefer it to be a melee-buffer build, but would look at caster-builds too, of course.

A quick note. I'm going to London in a few hours and have to pack some, but I'll be back in this thread after the weekend.<br><br>Stoneskin is damage Reduction and doesn't stack with DR from Barb, DwD or EDR.

I meant the damage absorbing portion actually, not the DR;  as in extending your combat ability by absorbing the first 100 points you would have taken. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By 4SakN on 04/24/08 13:40</span></i></p>

Please tell me these are for PvM.  Not to offend, but it hurts my eyes to see no tumble class builds.<br><br>Also, your server lets races other than Dwarves become DWARVEN Defenders?

They're all the better with a 3rd class that has TUMBLE, however.<br><br>23 Cleric 14 DwD 3 Rogue - Str or Dex.  Fairly classic PvP build.  I like Str based with Dwarven Waraxe, personally.<br><br>16 Cleric 6 Monk 18 DwD (or 20 6 14) - makes for an ok dual kama.<br><br>21 Cleric 14 DwD 5 Harper Scout - use the 2 HS feats for either Great Cha to boost Divine Shield/Might , or ESF in Concentration (to resist Taunts and AoO while casting) and Discipline.  Plus, you get Tumble and Harper potions (neato!).  Not a lot of feats to go around in pre-epic, though.<br><br>24 Cleric 14 DwD 2 Assassin (or 28 10 2) - Same as the rogue one above, for the most part, only more evil!  Str or Dex.<br><br>20 Cleric 18 DwD 2 Shadowdancer (or 20 10 10 for Epic Dodge)- Dex based, Hips, handaxe, whip (!), or kukri works nice.  Need high Int for enough MS, Hide, and Tumble to cross-class for Sdd.<br><br>Maybe one of those will work for you.  Either way, DwD's are fun.  Enjoy!

If you're not worried about being dispelled, here's what occurs to me at first glance: CLC 18/DwD 18/FTR 4. I've not worked out a levelling scheme, but if you go with only 1 FTR level pre-epic, you'll end up with:<br><br>8 pre-epic feats: I'd take Extend Spell as one of them. Weapon Focus. Whatever else you fancy (Toughness and Dodge needed for DwD though).<br><br>11 epic feats (7 general, 2 FTR bonus feats, and 2 DwD bonus feats). Take 3 EDR feats, Armor Skin, and Epic Prowess (all can be taken as bonus feats, but one will have to be as a general feat). Epic Weapon Focus, and the remaining 5 as GRT STR/CON/WIS.<br><br>Stats are a bit tough:<br><br>STR 14 (add 6)<br>DEX 14<br>CON 18 (add 4)<br>INT 10<br>WIS 14 (add 5)<br>CHA 6<br><br><br>End with:<br><br>STR 20<br>DEX 14<br>CON 22<br>INT 10<br>WIS 19<br>CHA 6<br><br>Raise WIS only when needed to access the next level of spells. You can choose to raise STR early and delay the DR or raise CON early and delay the STR boost. I'd probably choose the latter, since you can augment STR/damage/AB with spells.<br><br>Use your meagre skill points for Discipline and cross-class Tumble.<br><br>You'll end with level 9 spells (lots of slots to be used for metamagicked buffs), 21/- DR, quite a lot of HPs, and even though your raw AB will be low, you can easily augment both AB and damage with your Cleric spells.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 04/24/08 19:49</span></i></p>

I agree with Cin. If you using Dwarven Defender I usually like to have atleast 22 levels. Adding Cleric though means 18 levels as well. That leaves 4 levels to play with. Fighter, Rogue, Monk are all possibilties depending on if you want Skill dumps or WS/EWS and feats.

Sometimes 19 wis is just a bit too hard to fit into a melee build without serious sacrifices.<br><br>Maybe a Cleric 16 DwD 22 Assassin 2?  No 9th level spells, and an easy dispel, but you can fit Dev in there pretty easy, and have Tumble and UMD, maybe even epic traps (out of combat) if you can fit in ESF and a late skill dump at level 39.
