Good day to everyone. I've been testing this build for quite some time, and I've had a fairly good success with it in a run through the OC and HotU.<br><br>I love paladins because of high saves and ability to turn his social skills into offense as well as defense. But, I also have this envy of spellcasters slinging fireballs and killing everything with a screaming banshee. Thus, wanting to experience both in one character, I eventually came up with this spellsword.<br><br>The only build with a similar class distribution is Xylophone's Blessed <i>Knight of Mystra</i>. However, it focuses on the physical aspect of the spellsword, utilizing mostly buffs and no-save spells for offense, while my spellsword concentrates on the arcane and the divine ability of the Pal/Sorc combination while still being able to hack at the enemy when all else fails.<br><br>Without further ado, here is the Knight of Mystic Fire.<br><br><b>Knight of the Mystic Fire</b><br><i>PVM: lvl 1 - 40</i><br><br>Human: (Quick to Master)<br>Alignment: Lawful Good<br><br><b>ABILITIES</b><br>STR: 14<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 16 (30)<br><br><b>LEVELLING GUIDE</b><br><br>01: Sorcerer(1): Spell Focus: Necromancy*, Still Spell<br>02: Sorcerer(2)<br>03: Sorcerer(3): Power Attack<br>04: Sorcerer(4): CHA+1, (CHA=17)<br>05: Sorcerer(5)<br>06: Paladin(1): Weapon Focus<br>07: Paladin(2): {Smite Evil}<br>08: Sorcerer(6): CHA+1, (CHA=18)<br>09: Paladin(3): Divine Might<br>10: Sorcerer(7)<br>11: Sorcerer(8)<br>12: Paladin(4): CHA+1, Divine Shield, (CHA=19)<br>13: Champion of Torm(1)<br>14: Champion of Torm(2): Knockdown<br>15: Champion of Torm(3): Empower Spell*<br>16: Champion of Torm(4): CHA+1, Improved Critical,(CHA=20)<br>17: Champion of Torm(5)<br>18: Champion of Torm(6): Greater Spell Focus:Necromancy*, Improved Knockdown<br>19: Champion of Torm(7):  <br>20: Champion of Torm(8): CHA+1, Blind Fight, (CHA=21)<br>21: Champion of Torm(9): Great Charisma I, (CHA=22)<br>22: Sorcerer(9)<br>23: Sorcerer(10)<br>24: Sorcerer(11): CHA+1, Great Charisma II, (CHA=24)<br>25: Sorcerer(12)<br>26: Sorcerer(13)<br>27: Sorcerer(14): Great Charisma III, (CHA=25)<br>28: Sorcerer(15): CHA+1, (CHA=26)<br>29: Sorcerer(16)<br>30: Sorcerer(17): Great Charisma IV, (CHA=27)<br>31: Sorcerer(18)<br>32: Sorcerer(19): CHA+1, (CHA=28)<br>33: Sorcerer(20): Automatic Still Spell I<br>34: Sorcerer(21)<br>35: Sorcerer(22)<br>36: Sorcerer(23): CHA+1, Automatic Still Spell II, Automatic Still Spell III, (CHA=29)<br>37: Sorcerer(24)<br>38: Sorcerer(25)<br>39: Champion of Torm(10): Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy*,<br>Epic Weapon Focus<br>40: Sorcerer(26): CHA+1, Epic Spell: Epic Warding (CHA=30)<br><br>* - Personal preference.

Mords is also there to help out. For the low AB, not really sure but I use true strike coupled with IKD. GMW can also help, as well as +STR equipment. Monks will definitely be a pain for this character.<br><br>All in all, I think this character is best suited for low-mid level adventures/worlds, where +26 spell resistance and +10 AC armors aren't that much in abundance. Regardless, equipments to get should be focused on CHA, STR, and CON boosting equipment.<br><br>Thoughts anyone? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Edit: Sorry, couldn't include link to Xylophone's Blessed Knight. It says message contains too many chars without space (using a href). How do I include a link in a post?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By basuraman on 11/02/07 11:07</span></i></p>
