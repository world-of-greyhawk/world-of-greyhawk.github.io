Hello, I'm trying to get a good cleric/wm/fighter for a pvm/pvp server (Its actually Hybrid LotR in roleplay for those who care  ) Note I dont want the max in only 1 aspect. For example I dont want a build that can crit over 200 damage, but he cant hit a darn thing....I dont care about playability from 1-40, I want to be the best of my characters potention at level 40. I want a 1 handed weapon(x4 multiplier with WM levels, so no scim which is only x3) and a shield<br><br>That ^ in 25 words or less: x4 multiplier, not good in only one aspect, I need to be at the best of my ability at level 40<br><br>Here are 3 build I found in the Epic Char build Index, so I prefer if I can use one of these, since I have a template to go on. Im not sure which would be best for me and what I need (Stated above)<br><br>The Miserable Devastating Dwarf By Avado<br><br>The Blade Apostle By Eluvan<br><br>Hannibal By Firestar<br><br>Thanks for any suggestions provided <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

First of all, i appreciate the reference.  The dwarfis one of the most enjoyable pcs i have played.  It really fits my style, and from what you have said, it seems to fit yours too.  TO get the +150 damage what you have to do is have all the damage buffs on when you crit.  With the dwarfaxe you can get to this level, especially with nice strength itms and such.<br><br>You propose an interesting idea about not caring if the build is playable thru lvl 40... I am wondering if the build could be tweaked to get even more out of it (i always design for playing through so i have never thought about building for not playing through).  <br><br>I am thinking that if one were to take human... hmm  <br><br>I'll keep you posted.<br><br>Peace

What?!? Bone Breaker didn't make the cut! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cry.gif"> <br><br>Well of the three you mentioned, I've always liked Hannibal.

The builds don't really need it either, you can get massive damage from the WM critical hits and you can cast Harm, which is generally more lethal than devastating critical anyway (though you can only use it a couple of times a day).  I will say that Avado's build is impressive (I'll call it the third best I've seen for this mix of classes), and it would be difficult to improve on if you want Devastating Critical with this mix of classes.  My only problem with Hannibal and Avado's build is the low caster level, which means you can be dispelled fairly easily.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Not really.  It seems to have pretty much everything you want.  As I am biased towards this build, you might want to wait to see if anyone else posts suggestions.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

It's something you can do if you want the extra point of AB and the feat.  You would lose some spells (1 less level 5, 1 less level 7, two less level 8s and 3 less level 9s) and I believe shield of faith gives you 2 AC +1 for every 6 levels, up to +5  (so it maxes out at level 18). Also you would be easier to dispel.  For PvM the extra spells would definitely be better.  For PvP it might be worth the switch, I'll say it depends on how many casters you'll be fighting.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 06/18/05 08:48</span></i></p>

LOL!  All this in just a few hours!   Mith, i love your build.  Afterall its a cleric/ftr/wm build.  He asked for a build that is maxed for lv 40, not worryin about lvlin to 40.   I took alook at the dwarf build and tweaked it by 4 ab (for some reason its 4ab unarmed but only 2 ab when you ready the dwarfaxe??) But you are right, I took dev crit cause it was along time ago when i actually built the dwarf (posted it later cuz i thought it was obvious) and dev crit was a novelty, and it does "work" with the dwarf build cuz it follows that if he just hit you for 150damage, it could kill you instantly!  LMAO  <br><br>Anyway, with this type of build (clr/ftr/wm) the reality is that you are a fightr first and cleric second.  Taking more than 15 lvls of cleric is a waste (9th lvl spells rnt really that important imho vs the ab) and with extend spell you get great duration on the buffs.   To tweak the dwarf, i would change the lvlin to ftr12/wm13/cl15  and take preepic 6ftr/10wm/4ftr then 15clr/2ftr/3wm  or what have you.  That gives you the max ab you asked for.  Feat wise?  do what you like!  The first 6 lvls of ftr are enough to get wf in an exotic as well as qual for wm (take the 4 intimidates <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  ) Then take the feats you want.  It depends on your play style.<br><br>Peace
