Searching through some random builds, I ran across a couple of lengthy character-driven stories that grizz had typed up, and as a very avid and voracious reader of fantasy fiction, I have to say it is quite good.<br><br>So, call this a bizarre request but...<br><br>Grizz, could you put together all of these stories (I'm hoping there are more than the two I read) in chronological order?  Your writing is excellent, and I'd love to read more of your work.

I'm afraid, though, that you won't find any chronological list.  And only a couple are actually connected through characters and events.  The best I can offer you is to look in the List of Indexed Builds on the Epic Builders Guild.  There is a list of all things I submitted (save the War Wizard).  Some have tales, some do not.<br><br>If you need something more substantial than that, toss me a PM.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Finneous, sorry there, you're totally right.  Didn't even occur to me.  Thanks. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_redface.gif"> <br><br>Grizz, I did just that, and read each of them.  I was hoping there was a bit more to the story with the Bounty Hunter and the Iron Archer.  Great work though.
