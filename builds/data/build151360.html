I guess the point of this build was to create a Cleric with a defense as powerful as his offense.  This build combines a DR of 21/- with over 600 health and the ability to heal himself to full health with a single spell.  In addition, he does quite respectable damage with his Greatsword, especially with a few of his Cleric buffs to help him out (Darkfire, Divine Favor, etc.).  He should be a pain to stealthers as he can't be flanked, and he has access to True Sight as well.  <br><br>His only real weakness is his very low AC, but this character was really meant to absorb damage rather than to avoid it.  I would tend to think that he would thrive on a low-magic world in which high-AC builds seem to be penalized by the fact that AB increases with lvl whereas AC does not.  I'm not sure whether or not a build like this has been done before, although I would expect that someone has done something similar.      <br><br><br>Cleric 12/Dwarven Defender 22/Fighter 6<br>(pre-epic Cleric 12/Dwarven Defender <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"> <br><br>Race: Dwarf<br><br>Alignment: any Lawful<br><br>Domains: Strength<br>         Healing<br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 14 <br>Dex 13<br>Con 16<br>Int 13 <br>Wis 15<br>Cha 6<br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 25<br>Dex 13<br>Con 21<br>Int 13 <br>Wis 16<br>Cha 8<br><br><br>Feats<br><br>1 Power Attack<br>3 Cleave<br>6 Dodge<br>9 Toughness<br>12 WF: Greatsword<br>15 Great Cleave<br>18 Improved Crit: Greatsword<br> <br>You get 14 feats in Epic lvls with this build.
