Afaik, LvD allows alignment shifts.  But Pallies and Clerics are nerfed pretty badly there, so I'd recommend a Bard Ftr RDD.<br><br>Though I suppose if your heart was set on a Barb or DwD, you could go 28 Barb 2 Bard 10 RDD.  Decent AB, could get EDR 9/-, and Mighty Rage.

Well... I kinda gave my builds already, so no can do.<br><br>For an AC tank... well, take Pale Master and tons of DEX, some Rogue, Assassin, Shadowdancer or Barbarian for Uncanny Dodge or Dwarven Defender for Defensive Awareness. One of those is definitely needed.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

I made this back on the 9th for you, but before I posted it, you announced you had made a choice. It isn't an AC tank, but he can take quite a beating with 24/- damage reduction and tons of health. With 26 strength, Epic Weapon Specialization, and Weapon Master-enhanced criticals, he can do a lot of damage, too.<br><br>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br><br><b>Defense Master</b><br>Fighter(10), Dwarven Defender(23), Weapon Master(7), Dwarf<br>At 20: F(8), DD(10), WM(2)<br><i>Any Lawful, PvM (and maybe PvP)</i><br><br>Damage Reduction 24/-<br><br>STR 16 (26)<br>DEX 13<br>CON 18 (22)<br>WIS 8<br>INT 13<br>CHA 6<br><br>01 F(1) Toughness, Weapon Focus *<br>02 F(2) Blind Fight<br>03 F(3) Dodge<br>04 F(4) STR+1(17), Weapon Specialization *<br>05 F(5)<br>06 F(6) Power Attack, Cleave<br>07 F(7)<br>08 F(8) STR+1(18), Mobility<br>09 DD(1) Spring Attack<br>10 DD(2)<br>11 DD(3)<br>12 DD(4) STR+1(19), Improved Critical *<br>13 DD(5)<br>14 DD(6)<br>15 DD(7) Expertise<br>16 DD(8) STR+1(20)<br>17 DD(9)<br>18 DD(10) Whirlwind Attack<br>19 WM(1)<br>20 WM(2) CON+1(19)<br>21 F(9) Epic Weapon Focus *<br>22 F(10) Epic Weapon Specialization *<br>23 WM(3)<br>24 WM(4) STR+1(21), Great Strength I(22)<br>25 WM(5)<br>26 WM(6)<br>27 WM(7) Great Constitution I(20)<br>28 DD(11) CON+1(21)<br>29 DD(12)<br>30 DD(13) Armor Skin<br>31 DD(14) Epic Damage Reduction I<br>32 DD(15) STR+1(23)<br>33 DD(16) Great Strength II(24)<br>34 DD(17)<br>35 DD(18) Epic Damage Reduction II<br>36 DD(19) STR+1(25), Great Strength III(26)<br>37 DD(20)<br>38 DD(21)<br>39 DD(22) Epic Damage Reduction III, Epic Prowess<br>40 DD(23) CON+1(22)<br><br>* For the almost-never-resisted blunt damage, choose either Warhammer for sword-and-board style, or Heavy Flail for 1.5 x STR damage bonus.<br><br>Skills: 129 points<br>Discipline 43(51)<br>Intimidate 4(2)<br>Lore 4(5)<br>Spellcraft 19(20, cross-training: 38 points)<br>Tumble 20(21, cross-training: 40 points)<br>_________________<br>Great Research Tools:<br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWNWiki</a><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">NWN Epic Character Build Search Engine</a><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/" target="_blank">The NWN Vault</a>

Here's an AC tank I just threw together. Your AC should be pretty good, with +12 from PM, +8 from Tumble, +2 from Armor Skin, and +11 from DEX. With those skills, you should be able to find, disarm, and set all standard epic traps, and recover all deadly (but not epic) traps. I don't do PvP, so it might not be perfect for your purposes.<br><br>I just remembered that Epic Dodge is nerfed on your server, so take Critical Strike or Improved Sneak Attack instead of Defensive Roll, and Epic Prowess instead of Epic Dodge.<br><br>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br><br><b>Untouchable</b><br>Rogue(14), Bard(4), Pale Master(22), Halfling<br>At 20: R(12), B(4), PM(4)<br><i>Non Lawful, Non Good, PvM (and maybe PvP)</i><br>STR 12<br>DEX 18 (32)<br>CON 14<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 10<br><br>01 R(1) Blind Fight<br>02 R(2)<br>03 R(3) Weapon Finesse<br>04 B(1) DEX+1(19)<br>05 B(2)<br>06 R(4) Weapon Focus *<br>07 R(5)<br>08 R(6) DEX+1(20)<br>09 R(7) Dodge<br>10 B(3)<br>11 R(8)<br>12 R(9) DEX+1(21), Mobility<br>13 R(10) Improved Evasion<br>14 R(11)<br>15 B(4) Expertise<br>16 PM(1) DEX+1(22)<br>17 R(12)<br>18 PM(2) Improved Expertise<br>19 PM(3)<br>20 PM(4) DEX+1(23)<br>21 PM(5) Great Dexterity I(24)<br>22 PM(6)<br>23 PM(7)<br>24 PM(8) DEX+1(25), Armor Skin<br>25 PM(9)<br>26 PM(10)<br>27 R(13) Defensive Roll, Epic Dodge<br>28 PM(11) DEX+1(26)<br>29 PM(12)<br>30 PM(13) Epic Energy Resistance: Fire, Epic Weapon Focus *<br>31 PM(14)<br>32 PM(15) DEX+1(27)<br>33 PM(16) Epic Spell: Epic Warding, Great Dexterity II(28)<br>34 PM(17)<br>35 PM(18)<br>36 PM(19) DEX+1(29), Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor, Great Dexterity III(30)<br>37 R(14)<br>38 PM(20)<br>39 PM(21) Great Dexterity IV(31)<br>40 PM(22) DEX+1(32), Epic Energy Resistance: Acid<br><br>* Choose Mace for the almost-never-resisted blunt damage, or Shortsword for the 19-20/x2 critical threats.<br><br>Skills: 290 points<br>Disable Trap 34(38, including synergy bonus)<br>Lore 27(33, including Bardic Knowledge)<br>Open Lock 40(51)<br>Perform 9(9)<br>Search 40(42)<br>Set Trap 32(45, including synergy bonus)<br>Spellcraft 43(45)<br>Tumble 40 (51)<br>Use Magic Device 25(25)<br>_________________<br>Great Research Tools:<br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWNWiki</a><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">NWN Epic Character Build Search Engine</a><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/" target="_blank">The NWN Vault</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Empyre65 on 02/19/08 05:17</span></i></p>

The feat weapon finesse; <a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Weapon_finesse" target="_blank">http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Weapon_finesse</a> can only be used in conjunction with a small weapon i.e. one that can be wielded one-handed for all races. The only exception to this is the rapier, which AFAIK cannot be finessed when used two-handed (with a gnome/halfling).<br><br>Normally the only stat which determines your AB bonus is strength. Finessing a weapon enables you to change your AB according to dexterity, not strength. Which means that the only way to use any weapon other than something small or a rapier and achieve any kind of AB is to focus on strength.<br><br>Hope this helps,<br>Kurth<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By K U R T H on 02/19/08 16:35</span></i></p>

(and there's probably more than what I mention here) ... like no Dev, no Hips, no dual-wielding kamas or disarm, is just plain ridiculous, especially for a PvP server.  How is that anything like playing NWN at all when you take so much of the core of the game away?  You may as well play a different game than NWN, because it sounds like your server has basically removed some of the coolest things about the game, and consequently, the fun as well.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_mad.gif">

I'd have to agree with Hiwatt here. For a PvP server to disable crucial skills, which can be "balanced" effectively through other means and even just counter-builds, is ridiculous IMHO... Especially the kamas <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">

In addition to the changes I already suggested for the feats at level 27, you could take Curse Song at level 15 and move Expertise to level 18, and drop Improved Expertise. There it little point in doing so with only 4 levels of Bard, though.<br>_________________<br>Great Research Tools:<br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWNWiki</a><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">NWN Epic Character Build Search Engine</a><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/" target="_blank">The NWN Vault</a>
