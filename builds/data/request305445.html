Just some considerations:<br><br>If you want a level 9 Cleric spellcaster, it would only work well if you got at least 30 levels of Cleric for spell DC. That won't give you 40 AB unbuffed, but with your buffs you can get it up to over 50 (yeah clerics are too easy). It would depend mostly on what you want your build to do. Why did you ask for Cleric / Monk? What are you hoping to achieve?<br><br>Maybe something like Cleric (30) / Monk (9) / Shadowdancer (1)<br><br>Human<br><br>STR 10<br>DEX 14<br>CON 12<br>INT 14<br>WIS 16<br>CHA 10*<br><br>* Negative Ability here would be a good idea, then you could pump up strength or reduce constitution to 10 and get 16 starting dexterity.<br><br>Take it EZ!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Maximillian Kane on 01/13/09 15:25</span></i></p>

The best base attack you can get is 25, weapon focus/epic weapon focus/epic prowess adds 4 to give you 29.  To hit 40 AB completely unbuffed would require 32 strength or 32 dexterity unbuffed.<br><br>I'd suggest not worrying about the 40 mark as clerics have Divine Power (+5 AB and an extra attack), Divine Favor (+5 attack and damage), Greater Magic Weapon (+5 attack and damage), Bless (+1 attack), Aid (+1 attack), Prayer (+1 attack, damage, and saves), and Battletide (+2 attack, damage, and saves).  That's a total of +20 AB, which is the AB cap from magic.<br><br>So, if we look at the "ideal" unbuffed AB of 40, the character could then add 6 AB from buffing str, dex, or wisdom.  They could then add another 5-6 (typically) from a magically enhanced weapon.  Let's say +5 for now.  That means the "ideal" AB winds up at 51 AB without activating any buffs.<br><br>Let's look at our cleric again.  25 base AB, 4 AB from the feats, that's 29.  He can add 20 from spells, that's 49.  So as long as the cleric has...14...buffed strength, he will match or exceed a 40 AB character that doesn't have special buffs.<br><br>Most clerics will have at least 26 buffed strength, which would wind up at 57+ AB fully buffed.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 01/13/09 15:21 (GMT) -- Maximillian Kane<br>If you want a level 9 Cleric spellcaster, it would only work well if you got at least 30 levels of Cleric for spell DC. </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>?

Well, assuming you can't take a third class, then I'd take a high amount of Cleric levels, but for a build I'd make, I would suggest something very close to TM's build right there, I'd just take Fighter instead of CoT because I prefer Epic Weapon Specialization to saves, choose what you like best.<br><br>I usually take 20 Cleric levels with my melee buffers. 20 is still hard to dispel with Greater Dispelling, and I usually recieve mords anyway in PvP, so I could care less about being dispellable or not, I take it up to 20 because that's the level at which your buffs won't grow any stronger, Darkfire is the last buff to cap and it caps at 20 (unless I'm missing something). Sure thing Divine Power will last longer with more Cleric levels, I can't deny that, but I prefer to take 16 pre-epic BAB. As of version 1.69 (actually before that version, but I could never pinpoint when), with Haste and Flurry of Blows, Divine Power will add the bonus APR at -15 AB (-10 technically, as DP would give you +5 AB from having 15 BAB), so the extra APR is not so amazing as it was in earlier versions, given that, it's still slightly better to be buffed with Divine Power than having 16 pre-epic BAB but the low duration is not nice.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 01/14/09 01:30</span></i></p>

We are all giving great advice here, but I wonder if the OP has returned to read this thread, except for the usual folks commenting on builds (myself, as of late, included), he hasn't said a thing <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   (too much information, perhaps <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">  )!

You delay cleric for monk for the following reasons:<br><br>Monk at level 1 for extra skillpoints (16 vs 8 from class skillpoints)<br><br>Monk at 7, 12, and 17 for Tumble dumps, and to get to multilpe of 4 by 20 for BAB.<br><br>Take 4 levels of some other full-AB class (i.e. CoT or Fighter) to get 16 BAB for the extra attack (I used to aim for 15 to use the DP bonus, but with 1.69 you are the same with DP whether you have 15 or 16 BAB, and much better off with 16 BAB when DP wears off, so now I prefer to aim for 16). This will also improve the strong save(s) of that class by 3.<br><br>In epic levels, getting to Monk 6 for IKD on the sooner side is nice. Since you want to aim for 9 by level 40 for Imp. Evasion anyway, you have 5 to take in epic, so you can take them at 22, 27, 32, and 37 for tumble dumps, leaving one extra. Take it early to get IKD early. Note that I didn't do this above, but you could take a Monk level at 21 or 23, then drop the one at 37. Gets IKD 5 levels sooner in exchange for delaying cleric spells by 1 level.<br><br>For CoT vs. Fighter, CoT lets you take Great Wis as a bonus feat, which is nice. Fighter would let you take WS/EWS, but since you are a Cleric you can already get plenty of damage from DF, Prayer, Darkfire, Bless Weapon, etc., so EWS isn't as critical. Also, you are somewhat tight on feats, so squeezing them in isn't that easy without dropping something else. Also, CoT makes it easy to level without worrying about XP penalties, while fighter would mean you have to be careful to balance throughout. You could go for it if you want it, I just don't think it's critical for a str-based cleric build.<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 01/14/09 22:31</span></i></p>

Divine Power has a very low duration and the new version fixed the awesome extra APR cheap trick. Try playing in an older version, I once made the "lowest APR build" with 9 BAB and 3 Monk APR to exploit Divine Power to full, so your AB would go for example +40/+37/+34/+40/+40/+40/+40/+40 with Haste, Divine Power and Flurry of Blows. I never posted it because you cap your AB at a considerably lower value, but using the new version, you'd get +40/+37/+34/+40/+35/+30/+25/+20, because the extra APR are counted like an off-hand and don't recieve Monk progression, if I remember correctly. A regular build obviously won't take Divine Power at such disadvantage, but you can see why it's no longer so cool.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 01/16/09 01:07</span></i></p>

@ avado<br><br>I'm ignorant in terms of bosses in PWs more than anything else, since as you know I have not and will not play in one. I think that the problem is you keep bragging that you know so much and you're so good that you can solo a boss that all others fail to even kill and BLA BLA BLA. You talk way too much. Grow up. And just so you know I wasn't talking about level 30 strategies. I haven't played a Cleric-based build yet, so in terms of level 40 highly Cleric-based builds I have so far had no interest in trying one. I'm having fun with the ones I've created so far, and that's what is important to me. Anyway I'm done talking to you. If you need to diminish someone over knowledge in the rules of a game to feel good about yourself, then search for another target. I will hear from you no more.

Well Max, in his defense, you seem to "talk" nearly as much, despite the fact that you haven't actually "experienced" what you're trying to talk about.  In that instance, I'm going to listen to the person "bragging" from experience over the person without any functional knowledge on the situation, since you came right out and admitted that you didn't know what you were talking about, which is basically what he'd been "accusing" you of anyway.  <br><br>Sure, avado does come across as quite arrogant (and a little harsh) on the topic of clerics, but you weren't exactly helping matters by trying to argue that he was "wrong" only to go on and admit you'd "never played a cleric build".  <br><br>I'm not really a cleric fan (not that I dispute their power), but you won't see me leaping into discussions and spouting off untested theories as great wisdom.  I do know that I'd rather have a cleric 20 than a cleric 12, monk 4, SD 4.  Is that latter "unplayable?"  No, most build are "playable" under the proper conditions, but that doesn't mean it's comparable to something else, which was avado's point all along.  <br><br>It's great that you're having fun with the builds that you do have, but truthfully, you come across in this thread as being at least as "obnoxious" as avado, so I cringed a little when you suddenly wanted to "take the high road."

Going unarmed means you want at least 16 monk levels, which doesn't leave much for multiclassing, and makes it very hard to get any epic bonus feats (probably no more than 1). You could go for something like Monk 16/Cleric 20/CoT 4. I doubt you can get to 40AB unbuffed - let's assume 26 BAB if you take the 4 CoT level pre-epic, 4 from WF/EWF/EP, means you need at least a 30 in Str or Dex. That's tough to get while pumping Wis 19, unless you really minimize the other abilities. I suppose if you went with an Elf, left Str at 8, Con at 10, you might be able to do it, but you'd also have XP penalties and major problems with damage output (low str and unarmed so the Cleric weapon buffs don't help).<br><br>As for SD builds for Epic Dodge, they are very nice (regardless of what the other 2 classes are), but tend to have problems with damage output. Cleric buffs can help somewhat, but again most of the best of those don't work on unarmed builds.<br><br>If you really want to do a good caster cleric/monk build, install the PRC and build a Cleric/Monk/Sacred Fist. Go for Cleric 5/Monk 9/Sacred Fist 26 and you will have a caster level of 31, 4 bonus epic feats, and Sacred Flame damage of 26 + Wis mod per hit on your unarmed attack (and you can even go Wis-basd by taking Intuitive Strike).<br><br>TM

In that instance, I'm going to listen to the person "bragging" from experience over the person without any functional knowledge on the situation, since you came right out and admitted that you didn't know what you were talking about, which is basically what he'd been "accusing" you of anyway.  <br><br>Sure, avado does come across as quite arrogant (and a little harsh) on the topic of clerics, but you weren't exactly helping matters by trying to argue that he was "wrong" only to go on and admit you'd "never played a cleric build".  <br><br>I'm not really a cleric fan (not that I dispute their power), but you won't see me leaping into discussions and spouting off untested theories as great wisdom.

No, most build are "playable" under the proper conditions, but that doesn't mean it's comparable to something else, which was avado's point all along.  <br><br>It's great that you're having fun with the builds that you do have, but truthfully, you come across in this thread as being at least as "obnoxious" as avado, so I cringed a little when you suddenly wanted to "take the high road."</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>1- It amazes me to see how your "loyalty" towards older members surpasses even your common sense. 1st of all I NEVER said that avado was wrong, it has actually been the other way around since this thread began (him telling me how wrong I was). The ONLY thing I disagree with is the fact that the build his friend came up with and he posted the link to sacrificed 1 AB at level 40 in exchange for playability, and even in that case I know it's a matter of personal preference. I disagreed just as much or even more with Tattoed Monk and he remained civilized and polite towards me all along. In other threads, I have disagreed with several other of the "ancients" such as Grimnir and Finneous, and they were also polite (just as I was) all along. Starting to get my point here? It is a CONSCIOUS CHOICE to be obnoxious, and I don't believe I was EVER doing so. Never have you seen call someone else an ignorant, or anything of the sorts, but I have AND WILL CONTINUE TO express my opinions without any disrespect towards any other member of the guild, including yourself.<br><br>BTW: As soon as I realize I'm wrong, I concede a point. If you think that's arrogant, then there's not much else I can say to you, except that you are wrong. And FYI I have tested some of these ideas and strategies that I've discussed in many threads, just not in the same places, worlds that you guys play in.<br><br>2- If by "functional knowledge" you mean having experience playing in a PW, then yeah, I don't have any and don't intend to acquire any. In the modules I play, so far my strategies haven't failed me once.

Which brings us to one more question for the OP: Do you want this build to be playable from level 1, or are you aiming for max power at level 40? This is especially important for an unarmed Monk build, since getting to Monk 16 early is important for damage output (i.e. you don't want to be in high Epic levels still only doing 1d8 unarmed damage).<br><br>If you are aiming for a level 40 build, you don't have to worry about when you get Monk 16 or Cleric 17 (for 9th level spells). If you are playing from level 1, both of those are things you want early if possible, and of course it's not possible to get both before level 33...<br><br>Which is why my suggestion was to use kama(s) and only take a few monk levels for periodic Tumble dumps.<br><br>TM

Your Harm tactic is working in Aielund because it wasn't designed for the standard Harm spell.  We're not even discussing experience playing in a PW, but just playing good modules in general.<br><br>The original 3 campaigns were made incredibly easy.  Remember Vix'thra in HotU?  Remember being able to cast Heal or Mass Heal on the boss and reduce him to 1d4 hp?  You won't be able to do that in a properly balanced campaign (either that effect will be changed by a hak or the boss will be immune to the spell).  Ditto for Harm.<br><br>So far, and correct me if I'm wrong, you've played the original 3 campaigns and you're working on Aielund now.  Until you stepped into Aielund, you hadn't anything that was even somewhat balanced.<br><br>I remember a few years back being in love with a 2H weapon master build.  He had low HP, but I was a wrecking ball in HotU with my +10 weapon with haste, true seeing, keen, 2d6 acid damage, and regen.  I didn't even need to wear a shield or use a natural armor necklace (or the crystal of undeath's shadow shield), 40ish AC was all I needed.<br><br>Then I stepped foot into some PWs, Sands of Fate, Saleron's Gambit, and Aielund and got a very rude awakening (side note, I'm only part of the way through Saleron's Gambit, but it's a very interesting low level, low magic campaign, at least so far).  I realized that ignoring both shield and natural AC was going to get me killed a lot.  I realized I wouldn't get a +10 dream weapon with very low AC/AB enemies (Sands of Fate let me use that weapon, though.  Decent campaign overall, but *very* frustrating through a bunch of stupid things at times, I'm not sure if I'd really recommend it).<br><br>I think a moment like that will hopefully come soon for you.  You've been reading the Bioware boards and looking at stuff from this guild, so I don't think it will be as much of a shock, but from what you've said I hope/think fairly soon you'll do something and think "Wow, damn, I need to rethink my entire playstyle and assumptions."

For facing a single boss who has True Sight, I agree the pure Cleric would be better. But for mobs, or against anything without True Sight, I think the multiclass would be better. The Cleric/Monk/SD build has 5 attacks per round or 6 with FoB vs. 3 for the pure cleric, HiPS (which means anything without True Sight is practically helpless against you), better saves, Evasion, Wisdom AC boost, Tumble AC boost and speed boost. True, the buffs haven't reached full strength yet, but an extra 3 attacks per round will go a LONG way to make up for that.<br><br>Of course, a few more levels and once Cleric reaches 20, the multiclass is clearly better.<br><br>TM

For what it's worth, IMO, an unarmed cleric is a bad, bad idea.  Also, 40 unbuffed AB is soooo not worth achieving.  Just saying, do what you like, but the goals you set out are, in my ever so humble opinion, misguided.

Hmmm, for unarmed I'd actually take Monk up to 18 instead of 16. Empty Body is pretty nice once you're so close to it, though the last two levels would need to be left into epics in order to improve your BAB.<br><br>You're still in heavy difficulties with the unbuffed AB, with such a static spread you can do close to nothing to improve AB. Let's take it from 40, -4 from WF, EWF and EP, -26 BAB (from a Cleric18/Monk18/Fighter4 spread) leaves you at 10 which need to come from STR. I will need to convince you how imporant it is to drop status into negative modifiers, but I don't know how to do it, you don't even have an argument to fight against.<br><br>So, you need negative modifiers, why? in order to get the needed 30 unbuffed STR you'd better start as Half-orc and drop CHA, DEX and INT, or else this might not be possible. If you can start with 18 STR and 16 WIS I think you'll be able to reach the STR score, that would take 3 ability increases to WIS and 12 into STR, it can be done with Great Strength V, so it's possible, but just barely.<br><br>EDIT: Of course, I agree an unarmed Monk is a bad idea, but I'm tired of that. Here's how to make an 40 unarmed AB build, done, mission acomplished, be happy. Take it as a base and tweak it to your liking, but asking anything beyond this is unnecesary, you don't need more help to make the 40 AB Cleric/Monk.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 01/16/09 20:56</span></i></p>

Well, I've seen the Druid sticky posted by Emrill and truth be told, it has too much informative stuff that should be read in the manual rather than insight on how to use a Druid (I disagree with his stats distribution by the way), so I think it's a very useless thread, no offense intended. The thing is, if I posted what I know about how to play a Druid should I post it as a reply there or do a separate thread? It would have an entirely different approach, so I'd rather make it separate, but I never stopped a moment to talk about that and forgot about it.<br><br>I also noticed there is no sticky for Dwarven Defender. I can do that one if no one minds, since I've played lots of DwD combinations, I'd just need a mod to make it sticky.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 01/19/09 00:03</span></i></p>

Some of things in manual are wrong though. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  I have not read over some of those threads though, maybe glanced but not read it all, but some probably reflects how it's set up in NWN accurately than the manual does.<br><br>You are welcome to start another thread, title it accurately as you can, such as "Insights into Druid" so those who read them will know the difference.<br><br>As for dwarven defender, please feel free to make one for it. I am sure mods or I will sticky it when we see it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Anuis<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 01/19/09 00:02 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>Well, I've seen the Druid sticky posted by Emrill and truth be told, it has too much informative stuff that should be read in the manual rather than insight on how to use a Druid (I disagree with his stats distribution by the way), so I think it's a very useless thread, no offense intended.
