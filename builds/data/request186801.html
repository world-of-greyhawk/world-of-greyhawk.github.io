On the server that I play on the lvl cap is technically 40, but there is an in game cap of lvl 30 with 35 and 40 only being reached through lots of Rp and inaction with the world.<br><br>Anyways, I saw some nice lvl 40 builds and I was wondering if someone could modify a build to lvl 30 and be able to have the auto still spells if possible. We also have the PRC on the server aswell, so I guess the classes don't have to be exactly the ones listed but I do want the 15-16 PM lvls for the epic spells and the other bonuses.<br><br>Thanks always building gurus<br>Brandon

If you have the PRC installed on your server then Id ditch pale master and replace with oozemaster instead.

Haha, yeah... guess I forgot one of the important facts. I'd like to focus more on the fighter aspect, the whole undead warrior thing.<br><br>And unless I'm thinking about the PM incorrectly, they increase the level of spells you can learn correct? ie- gaining the lvl 5,6,7,8,9 spells while only having the 3 or so wiz lvls. If this isn't the case, then I will probably throw out the auto still spells because there'd be no point.<br><br>thanks again for the help<br>Brandon

Thinking about it it will never work well. <br>Or rather it can probably be done but it will not ever be playable.<br><br>Here are a couple of problems<br><br>With only 3 wizard levels you would need 28 levels of PM to be able to cast level 9 spells, so obviously you will have to take more than 3 wizard levels for it to ever work.<br><br>Getting the three Automatic still feats will probably prove to be very difficult since you cannot take it as a regular feat when you're leveling up as a fighter - so it might not be possible to make such a build at all. And if it is you will have to take a lot of wizard levels.<br><br>I agree with the other poster that if you're using the PRC Oozemaster is better for many reasons although you don't get the AC bonus a PaleMaster does.
