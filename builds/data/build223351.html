Hello all!  This is my first time and they say that's the hardest *laughs*.  Been enjoying reading all the builds on here and am constantly amazed at how much there is to know about this game!  Anyway, here is one I've been working on and would love to hear improvements to it.  I wanted a melee and spell type with PM immunities.  This is taken slightly off of the Magical Marauder but uses PM instead of CoT and reworks some of the levels.  I did a search for this combination and didn't have any focusing on wizard (of course, maybe there's good reason for that).  I tested it a bunch in the character maker and it seemed to do well.  Please let me know how I can improve this (I don't like the low number of attacks).  But please. . . be gentle *grin*.  (oh and sorry about no engrossing story to start - maybe I'll work up to that!).<br><br>Undead Spellsword (Fighter 12/Wizard 18/PM 10)<br>Human, TN, <br><b>playable 1 - 40 PvM</b><br><br>Str 16 (26)<br>Dex 12<br>Con 14<br>Int 16 (19)<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 8<br><br>All ability increases to strength<br><br>1 – Fighter1 – WF (Greatsword), Toughness, Blindfight<br>2 – Fighter 2 – Power Attack<br>3 – Wizard 1 – Still Spell, Spell School:  Illusion<br>4 – Wizard 2<br>5 – Wizard 3 <br>6 – Wizard 4 – Combat Casting<br>7 – Fighter 3<br>8 – Fighter 4 – Weapon Specialization (Greatsword)<br>9 – Fighter 5 – Cleave<br>10 – Fighter 6 – Improved Critical (Greatsword)<br>11 – Fighter 7 <br>12 – Fighter 8 – Lightning Reflexes (or?), Great Cleave<br>13 – Fighter 9<br>14 – Pale Master 1<br>15 – Pale Master 2 – Extend Spell<br>16 – Pale Master 3<br>17 – Pale Master 4<br>18 – Pale Master 5 – Spell Penetration<br>19 – Pale Master 6<br>20 – Pale Master 7<br>21 – Pale Master 8 – EWF (Greatsword)<br>22 – Fighter 10 – EWS (Greatsword)<br>23 – Pale Master 9<br>24 – Pale Master 10 – Armor Skin<br>25 – Wizard 5 – Great Intelligence I<br>26 – Wizard 6 <br>27 – Wizard 7 – Epic Prowess<br>28 – Wizard 8<br>29 – Wizard 9<br>30 – Wizard 10 – Overwhelming Critical (Greatsword), Great Int II<br>31 – Wizard 11<br>32 – Wizard 12 <br>33 – Wizard 13 – Great Int 3<br>34 – Wizard 14<br>35 – Wizard 15 – Auto Still Spell I<br>36 – Wizard 16 – Auto Still Spell II<br>37 – Fighter 11<br>38 – Wizard 17<br>39 – Wizard 18 – Auto Still Spell III<br>40 – Fighter 12 – Devastating Critical<br><br>Skills<br>Tumble 20 (Cross class)<br>Discipline 43<br>Spellcraft 43<br>Concentration 43<br>Heal<br>Lore<br><br>HP 335<br><br>AC (naked) 19<br>AC (plain plate) 27<br><br>AB (naked) - 33/28/23<br>Damage (mundane greatsword) - 2-12+18 <br><br>Saves start<br>Reflex 1<br>Fort 4<br>Will -1<br><br>Saves end<br>Reflex 19<br>Fort 24<br>Will 21<br><br><br>Well, I think that's it.

i'm questioning the need of 18 wizard, when you get no better buffs (as the DCs would be terrible) at level 9, no maxxed IGMS without maximise spell, you could drop 2 (or 3) levels in wizard and get another epic fighter feat or another pale master epic feat ( not sure how good they are though, i dont play PMs too often).<br><br>just a thought. Nice build though. see a few of these sorts of builds on the PW i play. Very nice.<br>_________________<br>Dwarves hate to be mistaken for Gnomes. Even Gnomes hate to be mistaken as Gnomes. They prefer people to think of them as small, effeminate Dwarves.<br><br><a href="http://www.Zogonia.com" target="_blank">www.Zogonia.com</a>
