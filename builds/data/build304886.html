This build was inspired by the Zhentarim Field Agent. I was playing a slight variant of that build in a module where there was a large weapon that you really needed to be able to wield to have a chance against an undead boss with high DR (it was the only weapon in the module with divine damage), and he couldn't wield it. So I made a human version, and noticed that if he focused on a scimitar like the original build he had better AC with a shield, but still had a tough time with the occasional sneak- and crit-immune high-DR enemy (who are also often slash-resistant), and if he focused on a 2-handed weapon he had lower AC and occasional problems with enemies with True Sight and nasty attacks. So I thought to myself "Wouldn't it be nice if I could have both?"<br><br>Rogue(23), Fighter(16), Shadowdancer(1), Human<br><br>STR: 17 (34)<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 426<br>Skillpoints: 375<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/15/23<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Traps: +5<br>BAB: 26<br>AB (max, naked): 42 (melee), 28 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 21/32<br><br>Disable Trap 22(26), Discipline 42(54), Hide 43(57), Move Silently 43(57), Open Lock 40(41), Pick Pocket 43(44), Search 39(41), Set Trap 22(25), Tumble 40(41), UMD 41(40)<br><br>01: Ro(1): Knockdown, Dodge<br>02: F(1): <b>Weapon Focus: Scimitar</b><br>03: F(2): Mobility, Blind Fight<br>04: F(3): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>05: F(4): <b>Weapon Focus: Heavy Flail</b><br>06: Ro(2): Toughness, {Evasion}<br>07: Ro(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>08: SD(1): STR+1, {Hide in Plain Sight}, (STR=19)<br>09: Ro(4): Improved Knockdown<br>10: Ro(5)<br>11: Ro(6)<br>12: Ro(7): STR+1, <b>Improved Critical</b>: Scimitar, (STR=20)<br>13: Ro(8)<br>14: Ro(9)<br>15: Ro(10): Skill Focus: Hide, Crippling Strike<br>16: F(5): STR+1, (STR=21)<br>17: F(6): <b>Weapon Specialization: Heavy Flail</b><br>18: Ro(11): Skill Focus: Move Silently<br>19: Ro(12)<br>20: F(7): STR+1, (STR=22)<br>21: F(8): Great Strength I, <b>Epic Weapon Focus: Heavy Flail</b>, (STR=23)<br>22: F(9)<br>23: Ro(13): Improved Evasion<br>24: F(10): STR+1, Great Strength II, <b>Epic Weapon Specialization: Heavy Flail</b>, (STR=25)<br>25: F(11)<br>26: F(12): <b>Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar</b><br>27: Ro(14): Great Strength III, (STR=26)<br>28: Ro(15): STR+1, (STR=27)<br>29: Ro(16): Epic Skill Focus: Hide<br>30: Ro(17): Great Strength IV, (STR=28)<br>31: Ro(18)<br>32: Ro(19): STR+1, Epic Skill Focus: Move Silently, (STR=29)<br>33: F(13): Great Strength V, (STR=30)<br>34: F(14): Epic Prowess<br>35: Ro(20)<br>36: Ro(21): STR+1, Great Strength VI, (STR=32)<br>37: F(15)<br>38: Ro(22)<br>39: F(16): Great Strength VII, Armor Skin, (STR=33)<br>40: Ro(23): STR+1, (STR=34)<br><br><br>He has WF and EWF in both Scim and Heavy Flail, WS/EWS in Heavy Flail only, and Imp Crit in Scim only. So, when he wants better AC, he uses Scim and shield, and still does excellent damage to sneak- and crit-susceptible enemies. When he is up against something sneak- and crit-immune, or slash resistant, he switches to the Heaavy Flail and gets +24 from unbuffed Str and WS/EWS alone, which lets him handle even high-DR enemies. <br><br>It doesn't cost him much - I gave up 1 pre-epic feat (stealthy) and traded 2 Rogue levels for 2 fighter levels in Epic to trade Skill Mastery for the second EWF (which also costs a few skill points and 1d6 sneak damage, but he still has 12d6 which is plenty on top of the high strength). <br><br>On a side note, this is one of the few builds that will work as a Half-Orc. Start Str still at 17 and keep Int at 14, and you have 1 point left over to pump Dex to 14 (for +1 to AC and Reflex save). Drop the two Skill Foci for Stealthy to make up for the lost feat (with the higher Dex, Hide and MS end up the same at 57). You do lose 43 skill points, but he has plenty (you could drop Pick Pocket without much loss, I just took that one for for fun). It makes him ugly, but could be a fun to RP a reasonably smart, skillful, and stealthy Half-Orc who can smack the heack out of you with a heavy flail to the back of head...<br><br>TM<br><br><i>Edited title</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 04/29/09 18:14</span></i></p>

Bravo!  This one is a keeper.  Well done, TM.  And going half-orc, as you noted, would be the coup de gras for this build.  <br><br>I think you could drop Improved Crit in a build like this, and keep Stealthy, but it's not really critical...(there's a pun in that if you work for it)  also, TM, you only have 30 levels listed in the build title.  May want to have a Mod fix that before the Guild has you sacked.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

TM, since you're not getting any rogue bonus feats in epic levels, why not drop 2 rogue levels, lose 1d6 of sneak attack damage and gain 1 extra feat from another 2 fighter levels?
