Hi &amp; thanks for your comments.<br><br>The strength is jacked up as high as I could whilst still making the 30 wisdom so that the dragon shape could be as dangerous as possible.<br><br>On the PW I play, an AB of 50+ is mandatory for playing with the big bosses. The whole point of this build was to create the strongest melle dragon I possibly could. I'm only using the Druid spells to buff me prior to shifting, I don't use any of the offensive ones.<br><br>I have seen the Dragon Savant build, and like it, but wanted a stronger melle presence.<br><br>(oh, and I did take Zen Archery <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Didn't use it much in the end though)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Dropbear1967 on 08/27/05 02:07</span></i></p>

When you shift into Dragon form you always get STR 48 DEX 36 CON 32 (plus any bonuses for buff spells and/or items up to the +12 limit). Your own physical attributes are ignored when shifted into Dragon.<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

Thats different<br>As I said you do get the benefit of buffing spells or STR boosting items that merge with your form. However I do not believe your characters own STR carries over into Dragon form.<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

Yes, I don't think that test is conclusive. It only proves that Bulls Strength carries over.  Test again, only strip him of everything, no buffs, no spells, and shift to see what his Strength is, not AB.  It's either going to be 48(or whatever the Dragon number is), or it should be 56, which is what your suggesting it should be since he has a non-shifted strength of 18.  If you don't see an increase of 8 points over what a straight dragonform gives you, then Amazonia is correct.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I tested out the dd dr vs dragon dr.  They do not stack.<br><br>so vs a +5 weapon the 40/+6 dragon hide kicks in giving 40 dr.  vs a +6 weapon the dd dr will give you 15/-.<br><br>if the dragon hide 40/+6 applies, the 15/- will NOT be applied.  you never get 55/+6 from them stacking...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By jjjhhhlll on 08/29/05 18:02</span></i></p>

The damage reduction fromm DD, Barbarian, EDR and from an item, f.ex. greater archers belt, all stack. If you have a 25% dam immunity, that is applied first, making it truly magnificent. <br>But, and this is a really big but  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    ,If you also have 40/+6 as in Dragon shape, the immunity(25%) is applied first then the best of the other two. Not both.<br><br>I play a Dragon/DD on my PW, and both PvM and PvP it is truly good. Especially since most monsters and players have better than +6 weapons at that level.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 08/30/05 09:43</span></i></p>
