"Even the Shadow Thieves have troubles now and then.  We could use a good enforcer.  So, are you in?"<br><br>"Yeah, I'm in" he told him, as he wiped the blood from his massive greatsword.<br><br>"Alright, then let's get going.  Better not to be around when the Guild finds out what happened."<br><br>With those words, he turn and started to leave.  His newly hired enforcer followed him, his greatsword securely in it's sheath.  They were on their way to Amn, to report that the job was done.  <br><br>He wasn't quite sure who this new guy was, but he could sure as hell fight.  Strange to see a warrior sneak around in armor like that, and he had to wonder why he kept mumbling under his breath like that.  <br><br>"Who were you talking to back there, anyway?" he asked.<br><br>"Not talking, praying" the warrior replied.  <br><br>"Praying???"  He was curious now, as was belied by the fact that he was raising only one eyebrow.  It was a curious look.  "What are you, a holy man, or something?"<br><br>"Apparently, I'm an enforcer."  was the matter-of-fact reply. <br><br>"Right, Right, but who were you praying to?"<br><br>"To Mask." <br><br>All of the sudden, the thief understood.  To think that he was favored by a god!  "So that's the source of his power" he thought, as they continued on their way, out of sight to everyone but the god of thieves.   <br><br><br>Fighter 18/Cleric 20/SD 2<br>(pre-epic Fighter 5/Cleric 14/SD 1)<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 14<br>Dex 14<br>Con 14<br>Int 14 <br>Wis 14<br>Cha 8<br><br>+5 Wis, +5 Str<br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 26<br>Dex 14<br>Con 14<br>Int 14 <br>Wis 19<br>Cha 8<br><br>1  Power Attack, Cleave, Weapon Focus *         <br>3  Blind-Fight, Knockdown *<br>6  Extend Spell              <br>9  Dodge                    <br>12 Mobility, Weapon Spec *                  <br>15 Improved Critical         <br>18 Toughness          <br>21 Great Str I       Epic Weapon Focus * <br>24 Great Str II      Epic Weapon Spec *<br>27 Great Str III,    Great Cleave *       <br>30 Great Str IV      Epic Prowess *    <br>33 Great Str V       Armor Skin * <br>36 Great Str VI,     Overwhelming Critical *    <br>39 Great Str VII     Devastating Critical *   <br><br><br>* Fighter bonus feats<br><br>Epic Leveling Progression<br><br>21    Fighter<br>22    Cleric<br>23-24 Fighter<br>25    Cleric<br>26-27 Fighter<br>28    Cleric<br>29-30 Fighter<br>31    Cleric<br>32-33 Fighter<br>34    Cleric<br>35-36 Fighter<br>37    SD<br>38-39 Fighter<br>40    Cleric<br><br><br>Equipment:<br><br>Medium armor<br>Greatsword<br><br><br>Skills:  <br><br>Concentration: 40<br>Discipline: 40<br>Hide: 30<br>Move Silently: 30 <br>Spellcraft: 20<br>Tumble:  40<br><br><br>Total: 223 skill credits (23 lost due to cross-classing)<br><br>AB: 25 base<br>    +8 Str<br>    +1 WF<br>    +2 EWF<br>    +1 Epic Prowess<br>    ______<br>    37 w/ mundane weapon<br><br>AC: 10 base<br>    +2 Dex<br>    +8 Tumble<br>    +4 Medium Armor<br>    +2 Armor Skin<br>    ______<br>    26 w/ mundane armor <br><br><br>HP: 476 max unbuffed

Level 9 cleric spells are not worth it 90% of the time, unless you have very high wisdom - I'd drop 4 cleric levels and 1 wis, and take 4 fighter levels and strength or constitution (or a feat) instead.

The reason I took 9th lvl Cleric spells was simply because I figured I already had pretty much all the feats I needed. <br><br>However, now that you mention it, I could use the extra feats for a couple of things 1) Improved Disarm, or 2) Dual-wielding feats.  Personally I think I would rather go for the dual-wield feats, although ID is always an option.  <br><br>Revised: <br><br>Fighter 22/Cleric 16/SD 2<br>(Fighter 6/Cleric 13/SD 1)<br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 14<br>Dex 14<br>Con 14<br>Int 14 <br>Wis 14<br>Cha 8<br><br>+1 Dex, +4 Wis, +5 Str<br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 26<br>Dex 15<br>Con 14<br>Int 14 <br>Wis 18<br>Cha 8<br><br>1 Power Attack, Cleave, Weapon Focus: Shortsword * <br>3 Two-Weapon Fighting, Blind-Fight * <br>6 Ambidexterity<br>9 Knockdown <br>12 Extend Spell, Weapon Spec * <br>15 Dodge, Mobility *<br>18 Improved Critical <br>21 Great Str I <br>22 Epic Weapon Focus * <br>24 Great Str II,   Epic Weapon Spec *<br>26 ITWF *<br>27 Great Str III<br>28 Great Cleave * <br>30 Great Str IV,   Epic Prowess * <br>33 Great Str V,<br>34 Armor Skin *    <br>36 Great Str VI,   Overwhelming Critical * <br>39 Great Str VII,  Devastating Critical * <br><br><br>Anyway, it would change the leveling order a bit, but that's probably about what I would do.  Not sure if I would do more damage with 2 shortswords than I would with a greatsword, but with all my Cleric buffs, as well as Epic Weapon Spec I figure I probably would. <br><br>If nothing else, it gives me more chances to land a Dev. Crit, although it's debatable whether or not it's worth the loss of 9th lvl spells.

Undeath's Eternal Foe is almost useless - Negative Energy Protection gives almost the same. It's not worth taking 9th level spells only to use one short-time buff which is useless 90% of the time.

You might be right, but if I recall, I think it gives something like a +4 to AC as well.

Not only does it give +4 AC, but it STACKS!  Which means that if you have a 20th lvl caster you can cast the spell 5 times in a row and gain +20 AC.  Of course, it only lasts 1 round/lvl, but that's still a full 2 minutes with a 20th lvl Cleric.

Interesting, about undeads eternal foe: i did use it one time with surprising results.  THe pw i play on had this one lvl where the zombies attackd you with negative energy potions that did damage to when thrown (and you would get hit with one per zombie).  Negative energy protection works everytime.  One time i did try this lv 9 spell, and i was gettin smoked, read HPS were falling fast!  The difference was i used this spell vs neg energy prot.  I will NEVER again use that spell!  IMHO it is a waste of time to even consider it as a defense.  I am sure it is bugged but i will not take that chance again.

Avado, if you need protection from negative energy, then negative energy protection is probably your best bet.  I just think it's kind of cool that you can get +20 AC by exploiting, I mean casting, a 9th lvl spell.  Of course, it doesn't really last all that long as you can't extend it, but still, it could be a lifesaver against tough opponents.

Well, if you are already cutting down on cleric levels, rather then cut it down to lvl 15 cleric.<br><br>There is no use in taking that extra lvl of cleric, as you don't gain extra spell lvl's (can still cast lvl 8 spells) and you have a full benefit from Greater Magic Weapon, divine favour, and the like at lvl 15, making the 16th lvl pretty pointless.

It gives you another spell slot, which allows you to cast another Extended Aura of Vitality per day (War domain).  Besides, if you drop Cleric to 15, that would give you 1 more Fighter level, which doesn't really do much for you.  <br><br>I suppose you could drop an SD level as well so that you could get the extra bonus feat from Fighter, but I generally like to take at LEAST two levels of every class that I take, one early just to get the abilities, and one late to max skills and finish the build.  <br><br>Also, not quite sure what you mean "rather get Great Str feats".  I am already getting 7 Great Str feats, which is the maximum you CAN get, as I don't believe you can take these feats on Fighter levels anymore.  <br><br>As for taking more Fighter levels pre-epic, that's perfectly viable, although then you lose out on Epic bonus feats.  Although the AB from Divine Power may be dispelable, the AB from Epic Prowess is NOT, nor is the AC from Armor Skin, etc.  <br><br>The only feats that you could afford to move or get rid of in the original build are Epic Prowess, Armor Skin, and Great Cleave.  This would allow you to take as many as 12 Fighter levels pre-epic, which would get you a +18 BAB.  <br><br>However, since you just lost Epic Prowess, you really only gained 2 AB, and you lost 2 AC from Armor Skin.  Of course, this would allow you to take a couple extra pre-epic feats, like maybe Improved Knockdown and Empower Spell (allows you to boost your stats up higher), so it might be worth it.  <br><br>Personally, I like the build the way that it is, but feel free to make changes if you want to.
