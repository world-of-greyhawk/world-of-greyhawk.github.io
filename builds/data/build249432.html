I had two DwD builds in the works for posting. However, the other is quite close to Grizz's most recent offering, The Citadel, so I'm just posting this one. In the vein of my Master of Resistance build, which is designed to get good resistance to elemental damages, this one goes for that as well, while also getting a decent AB with decent HPs and DR.<br><br>Skill points are at a premium, and the saves could be better. However, with the Rogue levels and UMD, there are a lot of options available to bolster the saves. The Energy Resistance feats were chosen to give a decent reduction against the 3 most common elemental damage types. Coupled with the good helping of HPs, he should be able to survive a barrage of elemental damage spells long enough to shut down enemy mages, and the 20/- DR (along with the 21/- DR to physical damage) in those damage types will also make a big impact on weapon wielders that rely on elemental damages as a significant component of their damage potential.<br><br>FTR 14/Rogue 4/DwD 22<br><br>Playable from level 1 to 40, PvM.<br><br>Dwarf, any Lawful<br><br>STR: 16 (24)<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 18 (22)<br>INT: 12<br>WIS: 8<br>CHA: 6<br><br>1 )FTR1: Exotic Weapons/ Weapon Focus:Dwarven Waraxe<br>2 )Rogue1<br>3 )FTR2: Toughness/ Blind Fight<br>4 )FTR3: STR (17)<br>5 )FTR4: Weapon Specialization:Dwarven Waraxe<br>6 )FTR5: Dodge<br>7 )FTR6: Knockdown<br>8 )FTR7: STR (18)<br>9 )DwD1: Improved Critical<br>10)DwD2<br>11)DwD3<br>12)Rogue2: Power Attack/ STR (19)<br>13)FTR8: Cleave<br>14)DwD4<br>15)DwD5: Iron Will<br>16)DwD6: STR (20)<br>17)DwD7<br>18)DwD8: Lightning Reflexes<br>19)DwD9<br>20)FTR9: CON (19)<br>   <br>21)FTR10: Energy Resistance:Fire/ EWF:Dwarven Waraxe<br>22)Rogue3<br>23)DwD10<br>24)DwD11: Energy Resistance:Acid/ CON (20)<br>25)DwD12<br>26)DwD13<br>27)DwD14: GRT CON I (21)/ Energy Resistance:Cold<br>28)FTR11: CON (22)<br>29)FTR12: EWS:Dwarven Waraxe<br>30)DwD15: Damage Reduction I<br>31)DwD16<br>32)DwD17: STR (21)<br>33)DwD18: GRT STR (22)/ Energy Resistance:Fire<br>34)FTR13<br>35)FTR14: Epic Prowess<br>36)DwD19: Energy Resistance:Acid/ STR (23)<br>37)Rogue4<br>38)DwD20<br>39)DwD21: Energy Resistance:Cold<br>40)DwD22: Damage Reduction II/ STR (24)<br><br>BAB: +29<br>AB with mundane weapon: +40<br><br>AC in mundane plate and tower shield: 30<br><br>HPs: 708<br><br>21/- DR<br>20/- vs Acid<br>20/- vs Fire<br>20/- vs Cold<br><br>Saves (vs spells):<br>Fort: 28 (34)<br>Refl: 23 (29)<br>Will: 20 (26)<br><br>Skills (153 points):<br>Discipline: 41<br>Tumble: 40<br>UMD: 32<br>Spellcraft: 20<br><br><br>I threw in the Dwarven Waraxe to go along with the overall theme and vision I had of this character.

Nice build.  Unfortunate that you couldn't get EDR 3, but it looks like the build will be the bane of dexers.  Good job.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

What resistance, you even outmatch those Clerics with Darkfire.<br><br>It is on my idea that you can go Fighter7/Rogue3/Dwarven Defender10 pre-epic, losing a pre-epic feat (Iron Will, Lighting Reflexes, or even Cleave/Power Attack and get also Great Fortitude). You could take Fighter 10 bonus feat as EDR III, or rather, Fighter 14 bonus feat throwing all the other feats earlier. +3 DR <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   you might not need it, but you lose no power and gain resistance. You would get skilldump quite late though.<br><br>Solid, I like it, I might try this one, the resistances are cool.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 08/10/06 19:53</span></i></p>

Me loves it, well done CD. With a decent ref save vs spells and all that resistance you're gonna soak lotsa damage.

Nice idea..I tried making a DwD with multiple resistances, but couldn't figure out how to make it work effectively.  Nicely done, very creative.<br>_________________<br>Favorite PW's: Hall of the Worlds, Higher Ground, World of Iniquity.

This is a pretty solid build, Cin.  Just what I needed, really.  <br><br>Also, I think Thax was on to something in his above post.  I would take it one step further and do the following pre-epic: Fighter6/Rogue4/DwD10 and then drop PA and Cleave.<br><br>Then in pre-epic take 6 more fighter levels, 2Rogue, and the rest DwD so that you end Fighter12/Rogue6/DwD22.  You'll end up with one more Epic Feat (EDR III) while not compromising any integrity or playability in the build.  Indeed, you'll actually add playability since you just added 16 skill points and more Rogue pre-epic for faster skill dumps.<br><br>Well done, brother.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Thanks guys.<br><br>Thax: Indeed that would be an option. My only concern would be the long wait for the skill dump in epic levels, but it would certainly still work out and still be quite playable.<br><br>Grizz: I don't think that would work. The build already has 3 bonus feats in epic levels from FTR. Your suggestion would end up basically switching 2 Rogue for 2 FTR pre-epic and losing a feat there. In epic levels you'd still only get 3 bonus epic feats from FTR (FTR levels 8, 10, and 12), so your number of epic feats remains the same. Unless I'm missing something.<br><br>Cheers guys.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

You're right.  I failed to add the bonus feat from your 10th Fighter level.  It would still come out the same, the, in the end, as you're just exchanging PA and Cleave and 8 hp for 16 more skill points, 1d6 sneak, probably a slightly better reflex save, and a couple more skill dumps.  Probably about an even trade, after all is said and done.  I thought I could squeeze that last elusive feat in there, but I failed.

If you were willing to trade 40 hitpoints and lose one point on your fortitude save, you could get the elusive EDR III by dropping the great con, and leaving your con at 21.

Yeah, that would work. I don't know if it would be worth the 3 extra points of DR though. Definitely something one could tweak to taste though.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
