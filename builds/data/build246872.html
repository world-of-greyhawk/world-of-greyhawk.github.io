<b>Should be able enough to wade in slash and curse 1-40</b><br><br>The Bloodaxe brothers had both gained quite the reputation. Both for their way with women and the world in general, but also for the combat prowess both showed. Both brothers had a knack for the arcane and was known to enhance their already impressive prowess with arcane magicks. They were both handsome by the standards of their people and well-spoken. They both sung on the battlefield and when danger ensued.<br><br>They were alike. They were oh so different. The youngest brother was tall and strong and wielded the battleaxe to combat. His training and knowledge of the arcane enabled him to cast his magicks even in full steel armour. His song was deep and powerful, a light-tower for his allies and a point of intimidation and powerlessness for his enemies. Rumours said they could feel the power of his song in their bones even after battle had stilled. Many was the skulls he had cleaved. And when given the chance he sure could hit behind the defenses of his unaware adversaries.<br><br>The oldest brother however was small and nimble. What he lacked in muscle he made up for in cunning and speed. He wore no armour and wielded a handaxe to make use of his grace, and his shield was smaller and lighter. He was able to evade oncoming attacks and usually attacked from hiding or by surprise instead of head on confontation. He used his arcane powers to increase his chances of going unnoticed. His song when in battle was almost a whisper, though it still carried long. His allies would hear a faint voice of encouragement and feel confident without really knowing why. His enemies heard a ghostlike whisper that nagged at their inner fears, making them unfocused and frightened. Sometimes when he hunted whatever adversary he was known to have already trppaed his adversary in, and was just watching while his spikes and acid did their job.<br><br>This was the rumours and legend, now see for yourself what the youngest brother Bloodaxe is like.<br>--------<br>For the DEX build, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "246874", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Rogue(10), Fighter(10), Bard(20), Human<br>NG, or any non-lawful<br><br>STR: 16 (28)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 15 (16)<br><br>01: Rogue1: Kdown, Blind Fight<br>02: Fighter1: WF: Battleaxe<br>03: Bard1: Curse Song<br>04: Bard2: STR+1 (17)<br>05: Fighter2: Expertise<br>06: Rogue2: Extend Spell<br>07: Fighter3<br>08: Fighter4: STR+1, Wep Spec: Battleaxe, (STR=18)<br>09: Bard3: Still Spell<br>10: Rogue): <br>11: Bard4<br>12: Bard5: STR+1, Imp Crit: Battleaxe, (STR=19)<br>13: Bard6<br>14: Bard7<br>15: Rogue4: Toughness<br>16: Rogue5: STR+1, (STR=20)<br>17: Bard8<br>18: Fighter5: Empower Spell<br>19: Fighter6: Improved Knockdown<br>20: Rogue6: STR+1, (STR=21)<br>21: Rogue7: EWF: Battleaxe<br>22: Fighter7<br>23: Fighter8: Epic Wep Spec: Battleaxe<br>24: Rogue8: CHA+1, Epic Prowess, (CHA=16)<br>25: Rogue9<br>26: Rogue10: Crippling Strike<br>27: Bard9: Great Strength I, (STR=22)<br>28: Fighter9: STR+1, (STR=23)<br>29: Bard10<br>30: Bard11: Great Strength II, (STR=24)<br>31: Bard12<br>32: Bard13: STR+1, (STR=25)<br>33: Bard14: Great Strength III, (STR=26)<br>34: Bard15<br>35: Bard16<br>36: Bard17: STR+1, Epic Skill Focus: Perform, (STR=27)<br>37: Bard18<br>38: Bard19<br>39: Bard20: Lasting Inspiration<br>40: Fighter10: STR+1, Armor Skin, (STR=28)<br><br>Hitpoints: 400 + endurance(up to +120).

Another nice warrior-bard build, with great potential for skills to go with his bardsong.  Well done.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Quite strong considering he still has 5d6 sneak attack with Crippling Strike aside from the regular damage which is quite good.<br><br>I like it, it's very good.

Nicely done, not much to add.  Maybe, as a variant, consider dropping crippling strike for improved evasion.  Your reflex save isn't high enough to guarrantee success and that feat could help prevent damage.  Still, fortune favors the bold, so you can't really go wrong with crippling strike.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Very nice, Grim. Decent, buffable HPs for a combat bard, very nice rogue abilities, with LI and nice, buffable AB/damage, lots of great skills, max'd UMD/versatility, and with that "good lookin'" dwarven err short human with the long-beard brother of his, ... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    Not much to add.
