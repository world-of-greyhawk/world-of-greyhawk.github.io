elf dexer, bard12/pm28.  have fun doing no damage though.   ac and damage are inversely proportionate.  You could even go the standard bard/pm/rdd thingy, irrc bard3/rdd10/pm27..  but dont quote me.<br><br>i love these assinine questions just as much as i love the uberest melee build posts... it would be nice IF, instead of posting you actually took some time and thought about what you are looking for.  I have made a cleric build with over 100 ac.  it all depends on the environment.  Have fun <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/08/06 16:20:00 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I think avado answered your question like no other could... </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

"Best AC build" is going to get you different results than a "great melee build with high AC."  And even then, you want to give the kind of environment in which you play.  Something involving Monk, RDD, PM, Bard, etc., will probably be in the general area.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I think the Rogue / Bard / Pale Master or the Bard / Shadowdancer / Pale Master nets you a better resistance given you can take Epic Dodge (I don't know the exact best spreads and stats, I've never done those builds). Granted, you'll lose some AC by doing so, but Epic Dodge will let you evade even a 20 roll once per round, so your AC becomes statistically more effective.<br><br>As said, the "uberest" AC build will also be a very useless build which takes several minutes to kill anything worth killing. The highest AC build won't kill anyone with decent DR or permanent regeneration.<br><br>Personally, I think the Cleric dragon (something like Druid 18 / Monk 2 / Cleric 20) is the uberest build in existence, buffed AC over 80, buffed AB over 60, lots of crazy dragon immunities, be happy.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 01/06/09 21:27</span></i></p>

You are asking for the best of something.  Well, looking at what you were thinking, why WM?  Weapon master, if you read the basic manual, gets AB bonuses.  That is why they are Weapon masters.  <br><br>You asked for AC.  In the basic manual (you got with the game), it sort of suggests that RDD get AC +4 in 10 levels.  PM's get AC at lv 1 and 4, then 4 lvls after.  I got that just by reading.<br><br>Now, dex is an attribute that adds to both AB and AC.  If you are going for max aC, you really want to look here, UNLESS you can get +10 gear, then fp+10 and tower +10 is a HUGE bonus.  Now it depends on if you can get Dodge etc. <br><br>Oh, there are 5 kinds of AC!  Natural, armor, shield, dodge, deflection.  Before 1.69, your natural armor was from amulets and barkskin, stuff like that.  Armor, well.  Sheild.. come on!  Deflection was on the cloaks and the ring of protection.  Dodge was the MONK boots everyone tried to kill for.  Dodge is really the only one that people really care about because the others are straight up.  I mean, If you have FP +10 and on a ring you have armor+4, you DONT have armor +14 AC.  It simply takes the highest value.<br><br>Dodge works differently.  Here you have the numbers stacking, so if the boots had +10 and +4 dodge on ring, then you have +14 dodge.  <br><br>Plus, you have to take Armor skin (+2 ac).  If you really want high ac, then imp expertise is nice (+10 - since i have NEVER used it, i am not sure what kind of ac it is (prob dodge) so it may cap at 20).  <br><br>If you play PRC rules, you DEFINITELY want a caster 21+ lvls (ex PM) for epic mage armor.  In PRC you get +20 Armor ac!  In normal, its 5/5/5/5.  <br><br>All of this is why it is more than, What is best AC build!  <br><br>Again, it really depends on your play style.  While I can and do use clerics to amazing efficiency, most of the time, for others, clerics suck ***.  It isnt the build, its the way the player uses the build.  Same here.  All the ac in the world means nothing if you dont understand the reasons.<br><br>what am i talkin about?  Well, the bard/pm i suggested above means *** unless you have rog or barb in there.  Dodge ac can be totally lost to backstabs so again, if you take this build and play a tank, your ac will be -20 all the time and you will notunderstand why.<br><br>Education!  The manual has SOME uses... not many, but some.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/28/06 00:22:49 (GMT) -- TyrTemplar<br><br>This post is for general information purposes only, and does not constitute a legal opinion or render any legal advice.

Cleric/shifter? really? I mean, why? I usually don't play shifters because I can get Dragon Shape with just Druid levels, and it's basically the most powerful shift with damn high AC too. Besides it makes no sense without the Monk IMO and you can't fit Druid/Shifter/Monk/Cleric in a single build.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;by avado<br>then imp expertise is nice (+10 - since i have NEVER used it, i am not sure what kind of ac it is (prob dodge) so it may cap at 20).</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>No, it's some sort of "other type of AC" just like Armor Skin, it stacks perfectly with everything.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

I know not of what I speak.  I'm just parroting something someone else said.<br><br>For my money, it's the bard/PM/RDD, but I don't really know.  I do know that the AC there rocks, but is it the best?  Not sure.  Probably not.

You <b>can</b> make a Druid / Cleric / Shifter build, there's nothing illegal about it, and it's probably quite a nice shifter build. You know, I prefer the monk but cleric is an acceptble third class for a shifter. Your Cleric / Pale Master / Red Dragon Disciple is blatantly illegal and made only for laughing at noobs, if "made" is the right word.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

k, i dont mean to be nit-picky, but cleric/shifter is only 2 classes, i see no DRUID there.  Sure, you can make a cleric/dr/sh, but i didnt see that!  <br><br> LOL  I find it rather sad that the reality is shifter AUTOMATICALLY means druid.
