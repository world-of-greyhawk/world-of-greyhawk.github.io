I apologize if this is a stupid question, but I've looked all over and I can't find the answer.<br><br>I know the Maximum spell-level for a Paladin is based on their Wisdom.  But I want to know just how much.  Just what level does the Wisdom Stat have to be to get Level 4 Paladin spells?  18?  20?  I'd like to be able to cast Death Ward and Freedom of Movement.<br><br>Thanks.

The stat req for any spell is the appropriate casting stat (Wis, in this case) Spell level + 10.  Thus, in order to cast 4th lvl spells, you need 14 Wis. <br><br> Of course, you also need enough Paladin levels, and of course having a higher Wis doesn't hurt, as it will give you bonus spell slots.

Ah ha!  Thank you for shedding that light on it.  But it brings up another question: "enough" Paladin levels?  If my Wisdom is already 14, how many Paladin levels will I need to cast 4th-level Pally spells?<br><br>Thanks again!

Not completely right<br><br>You get lvl 1 spells when you have 6 paladin levels<br>BUT if your wisdom is at least 12 you get level 1 spells when you have 4 paladin levels<br><br>You get lvl 2 spells when you have 10 paladin lvls<br>BUT if your wisdom is at least 14 you get level 2 spells when you have 8 paladin levels<br><br>You get lvl 3 spells when you have 12 paladin lvls<br>BUT if your wisdom is at least 16 you get level 3 spells when you have 11 paladin levels<br><br>You get lvl 4 spells when you have 15 paladin lvls<br>BUT if your wisdom is at least 18 you get level 4 spells when you have 14 paladin levels<br><br>EDIT:<br>Look <a href="http://www.systemreferencedocuments.org/35/theraven_stephenh/classes/PALADIN.html" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br>Where it says 0 spells it means you know spells of that level but you can only cast them if your wisdom is high enough to get bonus spells.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By MartinJHolm on 03/14/05 15:17</span></i></p>

*Takes one step back and bows*<br><br>What you list is in accordance with the table in the NWN manual. <br><br>I looked at a table in the Neverwinter Grimoire. I guess that table is wrong then. May this serve as a warning!<br><br>And when I think back... maybe it was at lvl 4 - not lvl 3 - that my pally got her first spell.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...
