Author's Note: while the pally/sorcerer/rdd has been done before (about 14 versions in the pulse cap, as of June, 2006), the vast majority take RDD for strength, neglecting Paladin smiting feats essentially altogether(with the exception of one, being Ithacan's build, which is a recent build; while a nice build with some smiting, it does not seemingly include the Pally divine feats). <br><br>As such, I wanted to create a character, balanced once again as between combat and smiting, with great smite V and combat AB 41 (unbuffed). All of the other great pally stuff is of course intact, with a nice amount of sorcerer levels also added to enhance the build's playability, and thus permitting your slayer to get his/her dragon wings WITHOUT the need for any alignment change. As such, this character is and remains within the ambit and concept/story of my Dragon Slayer series, the other two being pally-bard dragons (one is a high level bard variant, the other starring high level pally). <br><br>This latest socerer/pally variant (who is the third and final character in my dragon slayer series), to the extent that some PWs/hosts do not permit alignment changes on their servers, ensures that everyone to whom the dragon slayer legend speaks to can join in on the legend and fun, there now being three (3) variants of this character for you to choose from. I hope everyone enjoys this dragon slayer, too, and takes him/her on a great many wonderful and exciting adventures.

Alright, you are aiming to beat Mithdradates amount of builds, three builds with the same name, you want to confuse us or something?<br><br>First of all, I thought this guys would be made to kill dragons, but it seems more like a dragons that slays... stuff, because dragons (at least PvP ones, maybe you're aiming at PvM) generally have very high ACs above 80, high HPs around 1000 and are rarely evil, so a caster is generally more like it to kill dragons, not a smiter, no offense, the build is good.<br><br>You could simply take Sorcerer until epics, you aren't really taking advantage of 1 Sorcerer level pre-epic, level 2 spells are the good ones, and you could raise BAB by 1. Just as a playability thing, you should probably take Epic Weapon Focus before Epic Prowess, it gives more AB.<br><br>It's nice, the other two are quite similar IMO, but I don't have time right now to reply there too.

Hey, Thax: thanks! <br><br>This is a variant of my original Slayer, high Bard-plus Pally initially, which I cashed out also for more Pally (hence, DS Bard and DS Pally). Built this one, pally-sorc, for folks who like sorcerers better than bard, and/or who are playing PWs that disallow (or otherwise not into) alignment changes; maybe not the most original in terms of names, but they’re descriptive. (i.e., as to the classes used to conceptually build the same knight in me story, who goes off to slay dragons and, one day, while killing an ancient red, becomes infected with its blood, thus becoming a drake himself (which ye ole Brits believed in). While the DS bard version I see as a LG knight who, once infected, went somewhat chaotic (hence NG), this one (and the DS pally version), were instead "enlightened" and more apt to help the people (note: as the ancient Orientals believed re, drakes helping them out, as is also in me story; as such, just a variation on the same theme - and hence the name <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">        <br><br>As to slaying stuff …. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">        <br>But if it's drake killin’ you wanna specialize in well, Kail showed us all how to smite with a scythe like no body's business, didn't he? (as in, drop something pre-epic to pick up exotic weapon proficiency, scythe - and smite on (note: a crit scythe smite, with a wider crit range /x5, could land ya in the 1000s folks – see, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "16203", "242837", "0", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>  (2nd build in the post, &amp; just so beautiful thought we’d take another look; but remember, the scythe thing, that's Kail's idea (so please send him a li'l thank you note if, should you take up his scythe suggestion and crit smite an evil red … <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">        Plus, must keep in mind all DS variants have those nice pally and drake immunities (fear, paralysis, disease, fire, sleep and mind-effects (protection); in addition, on DS Pally &amp; DS Pal-Sorc (higher pally spells), there's death magic immunity and that cool holy sword of theirs (dispel on hit). Thus, should be adjustable.<br><br>Of course, yer not after the good ones as you're a good drake yerself, and would no more hurt, maim, injure or kill good drakes than you would a good or innocent human; then, gotta thank you, Thax, for pointing out, once again, that not everything out there is evil and hence the need, in not necessarily all but for sure so many environments, for combat AB/smiting power balance. <br><br>As to sorcerer, you’re right, those 2nd level buffs are terrific, and would be a great idea except for skill-loss issue (not a pally skill, hence, spread sorcerer out for skill dumps, plus pally’s have nice buffs of their own, and at 26 levels essentially not dispellable (thus, making it okay to wait, and avoid a skill loss). <br><br>As to EP and EWF, great suggestion! Was kinda thinkin' it nice for the "blood" to quicken/strengthen overtime but, if folks wanna get that better boost up front, by all means (in fact, will see about changing that 'cause, actually, for playability reasons, that really is a good point - thanks, Thax - as always, great stuff <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>But whichever variant of the slayer works best for you, make sure to give him a dex boost, some haste, and +5 items (for extra attack and AC 60+); also, wanna make good use of your taunt when smiting. With that, should do just fine slaying stuff - whether evil dragons or just "stuff" <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Slay on <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">       <br><br>Tyr<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/02/06 23:29</span></i></p>

Heh, Kail Pendragon always make strong builds, I hadn't seen that request topic, actually a WM with a Great Smite would reach crazy damages, maybe some variant of it could get to the max, I'm not sure, although I think it's more viable a Cleric/WM as for general utility, check this one out: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "174667", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Hannibal by Firestar Rogue</a> it's written that he can deal over 200 on a crit, but with little variations and fully buffed (as he missed Darkfire in calculations if I'm correct) a critical can deal over 300.<br><br>I think I was just thinking too much on PvP, since any dragon build would need Druid levels, even if taken shifter too, so smiting would do no good against a druid which has to be neutral.

Interesting! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">       <br><br>And yeah, Kail's scythe-smiter is neat, low combat AB, but WM in there def. helps out; on this DS pal-sorc (and the DS pally build) has the strength, and thus, oh, that scythe concept would work out just fine on the smiting DS' for sure (just adjust the first line to account for scythe instead of the big knife, add all that other nice damage stuff, then yer Great Smite V, and multiply that by the crit. multiplier (1000s!) - (that scythe idea of Kail's; it's pretty darn cool alright <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">        <br><br>But yer right re: druids and certain other stuff, as they're neutral so musing about all this extra potential crit. scythe smite damage wouldn't help on that, as they're not evil! Then, both this and the other DS smiter have really good AB for smiters, and can dish some nice damage, and can stand and fight with over 400 HPs (this one, over 500 with endure, and can also self-buff to the max, which is all indeed super nice, but the other smiter, the DS Pally, has Bard not sorc.; while similar, the DS Pally has some special charms of his/her own for sure (but there is the allignment issue).  <br><br>Ah, but the original DS, the DS Bard - see you like him. Cool. Yeah, he's the one that got us started, and he's a different build altogether than either of these two. While he has some great pally stuff, too, he's not a smiter like this one or the DS Pally. Instead, DS Bard is 21 levels Bard, and thus different(who can dish out all sorts of different damage types with good AB and damage, and a really nice assortment of skills, too; he won't smite his way through PvP (or PvM etc.), but sure can sing and curse and slash his way through (and me thinks he's in fact a different damage type to account for just about every nasty out there - <br><br>Then, the DS Bard - He IS the original Dragon Slayer! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   So, the choice is yours ...<br><br>Smite or Sing On! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">       <br><br>Tyr<br><br>(thanks again, Thax! - as always, and to all who helped out on the original version of the DS Bard: thanks so much again (&amp; folks, when or if you check out DS BARD, please see the revision history (for all the appropriate credits, acknowledgments, critiques, comments, and of course nice praises, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/03/06 05:32</span></i></p>

Hey, Grim: sorry 'bout that, &amp; thanks for clearin' it up. I totally missed that in the thread Kail sent me; guess I was in awe over how such a simple scythe, a basic farmer's implement, could be used not only to reap corn so to speak, but to sew such potential crit smite devastation against evil (my apologies to the builder of Damage Adept)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/03/06 08:51</span></i></p>

...and thank you, Kail, for that cool improvement on that cool scythe-smite concept (cheers to you both <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">          <br><br>But as to smiting &amp; non-evil stuff...<br>On both this build, and the DS Pally version, yer Holy Sword and other stuff (not great smites, regardless of any crit smite factor unfortunately) are your friend; totally though, as both uncle Grim &amp; Thax wisely point out - it's all about the environment <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/03/06 09:54</span></i></p>
