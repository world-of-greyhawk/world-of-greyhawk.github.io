I love using Monks.  I really do.  My very first character in DnD 3.5 was a Monk.  I like the fact that you don't have to worry about weapons and armors and yet you have a fantastic ability to avoid damage.  But I'd also like to run some minor spellcasting just in case I get into a sticky situation. <br><br>I've already rolled up a Githzerai Monk.  I also roll my own stats outside of the game and the edit them in since I really don't like the point-buy system.  So, my plan is to go Monk/Sorcerer/Enlightened Fist to continue my Monk-ish progressions while maintaining my ability to cast spells.  I'd also like to go to a full level 20 with Monk.  My only question is how to do this.  In my rl builds, I usually take very careful steps to find the best way of levelling, but then in my rl builds, I have access to more than 3 classes.<br><br>I wouldn't be opposed to starting again (you can import a new character into your current save, right?).  So, any advice from the build-making guru's?

NOt 100% on what you mean.  I have yet to hear of an Enchanted fist, but im still new here.  Could you maybe be looking for a nwn2 build?   if so, this isnt the guild.

LOL, ah right!  Never read a forum on xmas day evening!<br><br>If that's the case, i have no experiecne with that class. PRC is way too large and unbalanced for one person to know it all... well, that, and i havent played in PRC in a really, really long time/

Well:<br><br>monk level 15 is optimal, cleric + EF = 25 is good too. Just pick the best of both.
