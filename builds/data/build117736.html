I apoligize in advance if someone already posted a similar build, but I just couldn't read anymore...<br><br>Anyways here's a pally build<br><br>28 pally / 2 bard / 10 rdd<br><br>base stats<br>str 16<br>dex 8<br>con 10<br>wis 14<br>int 10<br>cha 16<br><br>level progession<br>1-20 pally<br>21 bard<br>22-31 RDD<br>31-37 pally<br>38 bard<br>39-40 pally<br><br>up to level 20, put all stat bonuses from lvl into cha. Feats: power attack, cleave, divine might, divine shield, great cleave, extened spell, weapon focus scimitar, improved critical scimitar.<br><br>lvl 21-40: put 2 points into str and the rest into cha. feats: epic weapon focus scimitar, extra smiting, knockdown, toughness, overwhelming critical scimitar, great smiting III, devistating critical scimitar.<br><br>adjusted stats<br>str 26<br>dex 8<br>con 12<br>wis 14<br>int 12<br>cha 26<br><br>skills:<br>spellcraft 40 (for saves)<br>tumble 40<br>taunt 43<br>UMD 12 (+8 from cha mod = 20)<br><br>Compeletely bare the char stats (minus HP as I didn't want to bother rerolling for max HP)<br><br>AC 21<br>AB 41<br>fort 31<br>reflex 23<br>will 26<br>dam 1-6 +8 (15-20/x2)<br><br>with buffs(but still minus any eq except a unenchanted scimitar):aid, prayer, divine favor, bulls strength, eagles spendor, aura of glory, holy sword, bless weapon, bless, divine might, divine shield.<br><br>AC 33<br>AB 55<br>fort 36<br>reflex 28<br>will 31<br>dam 1-6 +10<br>+5 slashing<br>+1d6 divine vs evil<br>+1 slashing<br>+2d6 divine vs undead<br>+12 divine<br><br>This is just the way I did it, the char build offers quite a bit of room to play around, ie boost con a bit for more hp at the start(or maybe int for more skill points in concentration or discipline), drop down wis to adjust then take great wisdom twice to compensate instead of 2 feats that don't really appeal to you. Personally I think a scimitar is the way to go especially with overwhelming and devistating crit. Find a keen one(or scroll with UMD) and you have a 12-20 range with a possible DC of 44 on the dev crit. Monsters that are typically immune to critical attacks, ie undead, still suffer quite a bit of damage as the effects are offset by the divine damages of holy sword and bless weapon.<br><br>Pretty balanced meleer, good AB, good AC, good saves, good criticals although not dependant on them.<br><br>NiV23<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 17:25</span></i></p>

Without changing your alignment, I don't think it's possible to go from paladin (Lawful Good) to Bard (any chaotic), correct? If so, you could go Paladin/Sorc/RDD for this build, yes?
