Out of curiosity, why go monk and focus on greataxe?<br><br>Since you are Str-based, you would have better AC by dropping Monk for some Fighter and more WM, and wearing heavy armor. You can get the Tumble dumps from Rogue. You aren't getting the monk APR schedule with greataxe, so the only things you really gain from it are good saves and Empty Body.

I wonder if rogue is the best option for this guy.  Monk and rogue have very similar skill sets (minus umd) and i wonder if the d6 of sneak damage is worth it...  this is only a wondering so take it for what its worth, cuz what you have is very doable and is solid.  Why not go for 22 wm (loose 2 rogue).  Or go 22wm, with monk 17 and sd1?  HIPS could be a very interesting addition to a strength scyther.  You would loose umd though, so really i am just rambling here.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; -- Posted by Kail Pendragon  <br><br>Being hyperbolic is an integral part of Avado's being <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

@ avado<br><br>Monks don't get uncanny dodge so that's the reason for the 2 rogue levels. I'm usually being ganked when I PvP, so I need to retain as much AC as possible.<br><br>Plus the UMD is a HUGE factor when you're soloing or PvPing, assuming you have access to scrolls. <br><br>Do I really need monk 18? No, but when your Imp Invis gets dispelled, I like to rely on Empty Body.

You should probably switch the rogue levels to assassin levels instead then. Rogues get uncanny dodge on level 3.

Actually, do you lose 1 ab if you go WM 19? This build was to maximize ab, even if it means by 1 point.<br><br>And the reason for 2 rogue was to take advantage of a higher UMD score. I was thinking about my other build when I put 2 rog for uncanny.

How does ab progression work?<br><br>You have 3 types of progression:<br>low (1ab/2 lvls) this is what wiz/sorc types get<br>mid (3ab/4 lvls) this is what clerics/bards get<br>high (1ab/lv) this is what fighter types get<br><br>This ONLY applies up to level 20.  After level 20, ALL classes are equal with respect to AB progression.  THe EPIC progression is 1ab/2 lvls.  That is how we get a max of 30 ab at lv 40 with fighter classes.<br><br>So, because you are loosing 1 wm (high) in epic for a mid lvl, it makes no difference to the AB.  <br><br>NOW, WM has its own AB progression bonus lv 10+.  Every 3 wm lvls you get +1 ab, so taking 19 vs 20 is not a loss to ab, as well.<br><br>Hope that is what you wanted to know.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; -- Posted by Kail Pendragon  <br><br>Being hyperbolic is an integral part of Avado's being <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->
