<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 .. PvM or PvP Build</b><br><br><b>Zen Guardian of the Twilight Vigil</b><br><br><b>Monk25/Shadowdancer5/Champion of Torm10</b><br><br>It has been written by sages that this secret Brotherhood had been destroyed long ago in the War of Tears.  However, recent events have suggested that they still exist, and that they have secluded themselves in a hidden mountain stronghold where they still maintain their vigil over lost relics of the Old Age.  They still send the younger members of the Order to regain those Artifacts of Power that could threaten the world, or to quietly end the breathing of those individuals of those who seek such artifacts.<br><br>The Zen guardian has a very high AC when just in plain clothes.  Against the strong melee types with high AB, he can immediately sacrifice 10 AB for 10AC, and still have enough AB to surgically strike and take them down while they swing away at his Epic Dodging-Empty Body Form.  He is Taunt resistant with his 40 Concentration, and also is proud of his good Saving Throws.  Spellcasters will find him a problem with his High Reflex save and Spell resistance.  With even just a few simple items, the Zen Guardian becomes exponentially a dangerous opponent.<br><br>Elf/Halfling (Human and Dwarf work as well, just start Dex at 16)<br>Lawful/Neutral<br><br>Str10<br>Int14<br>Wis15(18)<br>Dex18(32)<br>Con10<br>Chr8<br><br>1Monk, Dodge<br>2Monk<br>3Monk, Weapon Finesse<br>4Monk, Dex19<br>5Monk<br>6Monk, Weapon Focus: Unarmed Strike<br>7Monk<br>8Monk, Dex20<br>9Monk, Blind-fighting<br>10Monk<br>11Monk<br>12Monk, Mobility, Dex21<br>13SD<br>14SD<br>15SD, Weapon Focus: Kama<br>16SD, Dex22<br>17CoT<br>18CoT, Expertise, Improved Crit: Unarmed<br>19Cot<br>20CoT, Dex 23, Improved Expertise<br>21CoT, Great Dex I<br>22CoT, Great Wisdom I<br>23CoT<br>24Shadowdancer, Dex25, Epic Dodge<br>25CoT, Greeat Wisdom II<br>26Monk<br>27Monk, EWF: Unarmed Strike<br>28Monk, Dex 26<br>29Monk<br>30Monk, Great Dex II<br>31Monk<br>32Monk, Dex 28<br>33Monk(20), Great Dex III<br>34CoT<br>35CoT, Great Wisdom III<br>36Monk, Great Dex III, Dex31<br>37Monk<br>38Monk<br>39Monk, Epic Prowess<br>40Monk, Dex 32, Armor Skin(Monk Bonus Feat)<br><br><b>Naked AB: 41/38/35/32/29/26</b><br><b>Naked AC: 41</b> (51 in Impr Expertise Mode) <br>Epic Dodge and Empty Body x2(25 Round duration)<br>Hit Points: 350<br><br>Fort:28(32)<br>Reflex:42(46)<br>Will: 29(33)<br>Spell Resistance: 35<br><br>Hide: 43<br>Move Silently:43<br>Discipline:43<br>Tumble:40<br>Spellcraft:18(20)<br>Concentration: 40<br>______________<br><br>I posted this build a while back, but never had a chance to test it.

Now that is one nice build Griz.  I would probably go elf though for the extra dex; hp will be important to a point, but since you're not gonna get hit much.. might be nicer to have higher ac in the end.

It is a great build.

Khandar nailed them all on the head.  In a Dex Build, sooner or later you are going to need Defensive Roll, or Improved Evasion, or both.  SD5 can get you Def Roll.  SD10 can get you both (and slippery mind).  9Monk can get you Improved evasion.  13Rogue can get you Def Roll and Improved Evasion.<br><br>In this situation, there really is no point in taking more than 5 Shadowdancer levels unless going for SC V, and I could still get it without if I shuffled a few things around.  Slippery Mind would be nice if this build were Rogue or fighter heavy, but he's got 25 levels of Monk.  Nobody's going to mess with his mind.  Remember he has <i>Perfect Self</i>.  He actually has quite an arsenal, i just neglected to list all the stock goodies that come with a 25th level Monk.<br><br>As for Improved Expertise, it's just a phase I'm going through.  If I create a Finesse character, I go out of my way to pick up Impr Exp because the +10AC is irreplaceable--use it as much as you want, whenever you want, and my character's AB's are typically high enough that -10AB isn't a problem.  With just his normal hands, he was able to break the Novice to Epic Mod's 40th level Fighter's spine in 18 different places before he even landed his first blow.<br><br>When he goes Improved Expertise mode, he has a naked AC of 51.  Start throwing items on him, haste him, drink a potion of Cat's Grace and Owl's WIsdom, and his AC can easily shoot over 80.  Even a melee class with a 40AB with True Strike cast would still need a Natural 20 to hit, and guess what-- it misses because of either Epic Dodge or Empty Body, or even ShadowEvade if he was feeling frisky.<br><br>And on top of that, he still has a modest DR 20/+1.  It's nice for when you're fighting the mobs.<br><br><i>edit</i>: Griphook is gonna kill me. I forgot to put the Class and levels in the threadtitle.

I've made many builds along these lines and, frankly, they practically never die from physical combat.  In fact when I build a monk/SD dex character I usually make a point of getting Strong Soul, because the things I'm concerned about are death magic and no-save magic.  While you can't really do anything about no-save magic except jack your hitpoints up, you can go for higher savs vs death magic.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

I suppose Concentration, which you'd lose, isn't exactly vital but I imagine Heal or Listen would also be useful skills for this character. I wouldn't drop INT below 12 for this guy though. WIS could be chopped if you felt like it though to get the CON up a little but dexxers with all those really good defensive feats don't really need so much HP.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.
