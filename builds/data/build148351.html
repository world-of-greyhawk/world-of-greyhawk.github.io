I like builds like these, however IMO I would take improved evasion and defensive roll as my level 10 and 13 rogue bonus feats, then take epic dodge. Then again everyone knows about my fetish for SC5 , epic dodge. <br><br>Syrath

I'd tend to agree that epic dodge combined with SCV means a loooooooooot of missed hits. It would be sweet if you found a way to work it in there.

Yea, it's elf.<br><br>ON a side note, syrath's changes are nice; but, no ESF: disc  and lower AB/AC. Albeit small changes and great for PvM, they just don't work for the environment I built this build for <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>Also skill mastery is essential where I play (if you plan to set traps).<br><br><br>~ Lock.<br>_________________<br>"Life builds you up just to tear you down." - 3rd Strike<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Lockindal on 08/17/04 17:12</span></i></p>

Unless you are in combat with mulitple opponents at the same time most of the time then Epic Dodge +sc 3 would be better. If you have something in the order of 7 plus attacks coming in per round then Self concealment V would be the route to go. <br><br>Please note that I would consider this also subject to what items are available in your environment. Low magic would pull more towards SC . High magic lends itself to Epic dodge.<br><br>Syrath

Hey guys this is my version of locks build that includes epic dodge I accomplished  this by sacrificing 3 pre epic levels of fighter for 3 rogue levels and losing weapon specialisation and 1 attack bonus in the process.<br>I also sacrificed the ability to lay traps in combat:(.  However I dropped epic weapon spec and picked up armor skin instead.  I thought this was more appropriate for the defensive nature of the character.  He ends up with 44 attack bonus with a non-magic handaxe or rapier un- buffed.  This is a bit low for the server I play on but the massive sneak and criticals from hand axe should keep him on par damage wise and the epic dodge- scv  combo should keep him alive in some pretty hairy situations.<br><br><br><br>1 rogue	dodge<br>2 rogue<br>3 rogue	mobility<br>4 rogue<br>5 fighter	spring attack<br>6 fighter	expertise	weapon foc<br>7 fighter<br>8 fighter	whirlwind attack<br>9 weapon master	weapon finesse<br>10 weapon master<br>11 weapon master<br>12 weapon master	knockdown<br>13 weapon master<br>14 weapon master<br>15 weapon master	imp knockdown<br>16 rogue	<br>17 rogue<br>18 rogue imp critical<br>19 fighter<br>20 fighter	blind fight<br>21 fighter	gr dex 1<br>22 fighter	ewf<br>23 rogue<br>24 fighter	gr dex 2<br>25 fighter	armor skin<br>26 rogue<br>27 rogue	esf disc	imp evade<br>28 rogue<br>29 rogue<br>30 rogue	defesive roll	epic dodge<br>31 rogue<br>32 rogue<br>33 rogue	se conc 1	se conc 2<br>34 rogue<br>35 rogue<br>36 rogue	se conc 3	se conc 4<br>37 rogue<br>38 rogue<br>39 fighter	epic prowess<br>40 rogue	self conceal 5<br><br>Edit tried to clean it up it did not cut and paste very well from other format.
