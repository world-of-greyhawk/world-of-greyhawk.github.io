This build is similar to the Shadow Enforcer, but with a lot more spell power.  He has fewer feats, a slightly lower AB, and his Discipline score is lower, but other than that I'd say it's probably a better build.  <br><br>He gets a ton of spells, an animal companion, and all the other nice goodies that go with being a Druid, including Elder Elemental shape.  He can buff his AB up 21-22 points with his Cleric buffs (includes Bull's Str), he can cast Darkfire and Improved Invis., he can boost his AC 10 points with Magic Vestment, and another 8 points with Undeath's Eternal Foe (it stacks).  As if that weren't good enough, he can abuse HIPS, and he's got Dev. Crit. with a Scimitar.    <br><br>Although his stealth skills aren't the greatest, he does get some boosts from being a Druid, such as Trackless Step, Camouflage, and One with the Land.  In addition, his Druid spells allow him to buff his stats even further with Blood Frenzy and Aura of Vitality (feel free to extend it).  <br><br>He has TONS of healing spells, and if you need damage spells try Call Lightning, Creeping Doom, and Harm, among others.  Although the PrC caps the damage done by Harm, I believe in the "official" game it's damage is still virtually unlimited.  <br><br>In any case, this character is one bad mutha, and he can fight, cast, and sneak with the best of them.  <br><br><br>Shadow Druid<br><br>Druid 20/Cleric 18/SD 2<br>(pre-epic Druid 12/Cleric <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"> <br><br>Domains: Trickery and Travel<br>(Travel is for Haste, if you have perma-haste items feel free to take another Domain; I recommend Healing)<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 14<br>Dex 14<br>Con 12<br>Int 12 <br>Wis 16<br>Cha 8<br><br>+2 Wis, +7 Str, +1 Wis<br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 25<br>Dex 14<br>Con 12<br>Int 12 <br>Wis 19<br>Cha 8<br><br>1 Power Attack, Cleave<br>3 Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>6 Extend Spell<br>9 Dodge<br>12 Mobility<br>15 Improved Critical<br>18 Great Cleave <br>21 Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>24 Great Str I<br>27 Great Str I<br>30 Great Str III<br>33 Great Str IV<br>36 Overwhelming Critical<br>39 Devastating Critical<br><br><br>Equipment:<br><br>Medium Armor<br>Scimitar<br>Buckler<br><br><br>Skills:  <br><br>Concentration: 43<br>Discipline:    20<br>Hide:          30<br>Move Silently: 30<br>Spellcraft:    20 <br>Tumble:        40<br><br><br>Total: 226 skill credits (23 lost to cross-classing)<br><br>AB: 25 base<br>    +7 Str<br>    +1 WF<br>    +2 EWF<br>    ______<br>    35 w/ mundane Scimitar<br><br>AC: 10 base<br>    +2 Dex<br>    +4 Medium Armor<br>    +1 Buckler<br>    +8 Tumble<br>    ______<br>    25 AC w/ mundane armor<br><br><br>HP: 360 max unbuffed
