This is my first build posted and I don't have a name for it. So if anybody can think of a good name for this build, I'd appreciate it.<br><br>You can also go Clr 31/COT 6/Rog 3, exchanging a Cleric's extra feat for Uncanny Dodge. Since you have UMD, you can equip those boots with high dodge AC(Usually monk only), and Uncanny dodge is useful with some good dodge AC. Anyway, that extra feat will usually go to Armor skin or Improved Expertise, which also improves your defensive abilities, so make your decision.<br><br>Similar build:<br>Kali Pendragon's Holy Nuker(Clr 32/ COT 6/ FTR 2)<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "233531", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Playable from 1-40 PvM, no XP penalty<br>Human, any non-evil Alignment<br>Anyone with Harm has a chance in PvP...it depends on the module anyway<br><br>Str 14<br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Wis 16(36)<br>Int 14<br>Cha 10<br><br>I put str 14 simply because I want to carry a little more, and Cha 10 simply because I don't want my Cleric to have a Charisma lower than commoners.

Other evocation spells are pretty good, too. You can also use battletide, prayer and etc to lower the enemy's saves, which in turn increases your spell DC.<br><br>You have epic spells. Greater Ruin and Hellball both have good damage though sometimes people say that they are not so useful. However, it doesn't matter. They look COOL.<br><br>Melee: Bad, and that's why I did not take extend spell. However, with some low level spells and 1d6(2d6 if go lvl3 Rogue) sneak attack, this character can still do a little melee fighting against weak enemies if he is in a group, if you want to save your spells for tougher enemies. Since you only have weapon focus which gives you only 1 AB bonus, you would usually end up using anything handy, or something that increases your spell power.<br><br>Saving Throws are decent. With 9 extra savings against spells from Spellcraft and a little equipments that increase saving throws, usually you don't have to worry about death spells. You can also avoid a lot of Reflex 1/2 spells with Evasion. However, watch out for Devastating Crit melee fighters, Deva Arcane Archers, etc.<br><br>Not much exploitation of bugs, classes &amp; etc. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br>Questions, comments, and etc are always welcome.

This looks like a nice caster build (I like rogue/clerics); nice Implosion, and with harm, indeed! I also like how you get your foci out of the gate (very nice!) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">        <br><br>Greater ruin is a good one; true, only targets a single enemy but does some really nice damage (35d6 pos.) vs. low fort characters, and even as against a melee'r who tend (but not always <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">                to have high fort, they'll still take half; as to hellball, being able to toss something out to soften a bunch of enemies is always a good thing to have in your pocket. While reflex save for 1/2, (according to description) evasion does not apply, and those affected are also knocked - a good one me thinks in low-magic settings (excepting other casters, i.e., energy-absorption); at higher magic levels, elemental resistance equipment/scrolls, etc., well, not so great, but still, there's the sonic component to it, and being able to toss a ball in the direction of say a sneaky character who just disappeared ... - sweet! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">               <br><br>Some suggestions for you, totally off the top of my head here, but which would help you out on the melee end (always nice for a caster to have when needed in a pinch, yes?) -- drop Cot and take on ftr instead - two of them, in pre-ep, so as to get 2 more feats and also, raise your pre-ep BAB to 15; take strength domain, and use the DP exploit (there you go, you now be an "insta-warrior" (and extend spell makes sense, yes? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">               <br><br>Might want to pick up zen archery (with your wis for sure); as to melee, that cool club exploit be nice (like Sir Kail does, which he explains all so well in his build (thus, more ftr for you); otherwise, in epics, take more rogue allowing for more skills, better spread of dumps (hence, playability), and some more sneak damage, goin' the sneaky route ... just some ideas for you.<br><br>As to a name, well, if you go that route, hmmmm, Shadow Caster or, wait a sec., how bout: the Imploding Shadow, or something like that .... welcome to the guild, and Cast On! ~ Tyr<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 04/12/07 20:19</span></i></p>

As a matter of fact, Clr 35/CoT 4/Rog 1 looks better. Just exchange 1 saving throws and the feat Evasion for 3 more caster lvls. However, I personally don't like Clr35/Cot 4/Rog 1 that much because it means to get access to rogue skills at lvl 37-40, and I simply do not like that.

The problem with going Fighter over Champion of Torm, is that he loses Great WIS feats.<br><br>But, I agree - even with 14 STR, you could easily reach AB in the 50s with Divine Power + Divine Favor + Bless + Aid + Battletide + Prayer.  And if you have the War Domain, you could get an extra +7 (or something close to that) for 5 rounds.  And you'd get +7 magical damage from DF + BT. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">
