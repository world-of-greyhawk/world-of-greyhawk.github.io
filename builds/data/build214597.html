Cross-class one point into Open Locks, Set Traps, and Disarm Traps with your shadowdancer level to take advantage of the Trickery bonus powers.<br><br>This is a refinement on a build I designed when I saw the changes to Implosion in 1.66 patch and posted to the general forum.  An area instant death spell with a save DC increase and no immunities just begged to have a build designed around it.  Getting HIPS and maxed out stealth skills allows the character to survive without significant defenses in many environments - invisible until he attacks, positioning itself perfectly, then disappearing again to avoid retaliation and set up the next shot.<br><br>FAQ:<br><br><b>Q: This is a cheesey power build that totally exploits monk, shadowdancer, and the new implosion! Have you no shame?</b><br>A: Well, yeah, that's the point of the build. And, no, not really.<br><br><b>Q: Why halfling? Why not dwarf or elf?</b><br>A: You get a dex bonus that helps you with your starting stats, you don't really need high strength, and you have racial bonuses to stealth checks. Also, with the Trickery domain powers, the dwarf charisma penalty will take another turn's worth of duration from it (it's 5 + cha mod). The 8 cha halfling will get 4 turns; the 5 cha dwarf will get 3.<br><br><b>Q: Why don't you take any spell penetration feats?</b><br>A: Because with 38 caster levels you will penetrate 32 SR (max for a non-SR monk) all the time. <br><br><b>Q: 6 strength is really going to hurt my carrying capabilities... can't I have a higher strength?</b><br>A: This build's maximized for implosion performance and stealthiness at level 40... not for hauling around gobs of loot. Use your bull's strength buff and your henchmen.<br><br><b>Q: I don't have enough skillpoints to max concentration, hide, move silently, discipline, spellcraft, and tumble! What should I do?</b><br>A: You can get some extra skillpoints by dropping your dex to 13 and taking a Great Intelligence feat at 21. You'll lose the ability to take epic focus in hide at 39 - you'll be taking great wisdom 10 then. But either way you need to prioritize your skill choices. You aren't meant to get meleed much, and your cleric buffs can make up for not having a spell save bonus. Besides... if anything's still alive after you un-stealth to implode them, you can just HIPS, reposition, and either retreat or try again.<br><br>If you are dropping discipline, you can take Monk much earlier in the build, and have your monk bonuses as you level up.<br><br><b>Q: What about people or creatures with True Seeing?</b><br>A: Try and see them first, then implode them before they can do anything to you. Being able to self-haste via your travel domain spells will benefit you a lot here. Greater sanctuary is another good thing to have memorized if you want to disengage a true-seer and get out of dodge.<br><br><b>Q: Why take the monk level? It means I can't wear armor!</b><br>A: No, your 6 strength means you can't wear armor. The monk level gives you alot of AC points without armor, and makes it so that you don't have to crossclass skills to get shadowdancer. Carry around a kama and fire up divine power if you want to amuse yourself by meleeing... you won't be half bad at it.<br><br><b>Q: What can I do about SR monks?  Or enemies with magic immunity?</b><br>A: You can raise your spellcraft and pick Epic Spell - Greater Ruin instead of epic skill focus (hide) or extend spell.  Also, you can memorize a number of melee buffs, and fight them toe to toe with a single nonmagical kama.  A few simple low-level buff spells will turn you from zero to hero in melee despite your 6 strength - darkfire, divine power, divine favor, magical vestment, shield of faith, prayer... you get the idea.<br><br><b>Q: What about my offensive spells other than Implosion?</b><br>A:  Other Evocation school spells will have a base save DC of 30 + level; spells from different schools will have a save DC of 24 + level.  <br><br>Harm, of course, is as good for you as for anybody else.  Hammer of the Gods and Sound Burst are especially nice with this build as they always do full damage and use Will saves not for half, but to avoid special secondary effects of Dazed and Stunned, respectively - both good for keeping the target(s) from fighting back, finishing off wounded or Harmed enemies, or dealing with targets that have Evasion or enough of a Fortitude save to survive your Implosion.  Your Word of Faith spell will have a 19 round stun duration with no save, as well.  You can also use Sunbeam to decent effect - although it's a Reflex save, it's a save against the blindness, not the damage, for non-undead.  And the base DC will be 38.<br><br>You can also use flame strike, fire storm, and so on... but the truth is you just don't need to in the vast majority of cases.  Between your Word of Faith, Implosion, and Harm, only targets with nearly total immunity to magic will be left standing.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 09/29/09 17:53</span></i></p>

The main changes were taking metamagic feats instead of improved combat casting and making concentration into an optional skill.<br><br>I find through playing that the metamagic feats aren't that helpful for their effect, because with 38 caster levels even 1 round/level spells don't have to be Extended to outlast most battles, and there's little point to Empowering or Maximizing direct damage spells when your forte is area instant death.  But using still spell to make word of faith a level 8 spell frees up level 7 slots for greater restoration, or stilled harms and heals.  And other metamagic for similar reasons is good to have.<br><br>If you want a build that gets its cheese earlier, you can either take your monk level at 21, or by crossclassing skills, your SD level at 21, depending on if you'd rather have HIPS or the monk AC bonus.  The price of going monk early is that you can't max your discipline skill; the price of going SD early is the loss of skill points to crossclassing in a skill-starved build.<br><br>If you want more skill points you can start with a 13 dex and 13 int, then use a great int feat at 21 and replace the level 39 feat with great wisdom 10.  The price of this is a discretionary feat.<br><br>Those are the primary ways to vary the build, depending your environment and personal tastes.  Myself, I find the extra skillpoints very attractive, but haven't got a problem delaying both monk and SD to the end.  Clerics are so powerful that even with a base strength of 6, you shouldn't have trouble leveling in the majority of environments.  If you do, swap Empower for Extend spell early in the build, and buff yourself with bull's strength constantly.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Xylophone on 09/29/05 13:44</span></i></p>

I'd use silent spell instead of still spell.  clerics can cast in armor, so still doesn't add any functionality.  silent also allows you to shift your spells up one level and will also be useful if you get silenced or deafened.

It's not human because the build has certain base stat requirements that are most easily reached by halflings or dwarves.  And, possibly, gnomes.<br><br>You need to have 13 dex, minimum, and 18 wis minimum, to make the build work.  You also want 12 int, bare minimum (14 preferred) and 12 con, bare minimum.<br><br>Humans don't have any stat adjustments so they don't get any help with that.  Halflings, dwarves, and gnomes lose points in stats they don't really need (strength, charisma) and gain points where they do (con, dex, int).  But halfling has racial bonuses to stealth and various other bonuses that made me pick them.  <br><br>And the fact that few people use halflings, and even fewer use them for clerics, made me want to take the opportunity to use them for a superpowered cleric build to show just what those little buggers are capable of if you give them a chance.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Yes there would be an exp penalty.  You can, however, take the shadowdancer level early by crossclassing skills without an xp penalty.

Dude, 50 Fortitude means you're a high CHA Paladin or Blackguard or a high level Champion of Torm. My level 40 Fighter / Dwarven Defenders or Druid / Monk dragons (high CON and high Fort save on all classes for extra pre-epic save boost) don't reach 50, barely 40, and those are high Fortitude builds, regular meleers get less, regular casters even less. Even my Druid 16 / Monk 6 / Champion of Torm 18 only has 45 Fortitude, and sure it's high enough to laugh at Implosion, but it already has plenty of CoT and it's one of the highest saves you'll find in a low magic environment besides the uber crazy Paladin/Blackguard/CoT.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/03/09 16:19</span></i></p>

The difficulty with endy's comment is he compares CLERIC to SORC/PAL.  Why doesnt he compare CLERIC to ANY pure class?  Cuz, when you do, you fall short. <br><br>Cleric is the ONLY class where you can add ab, ac, damage, use spells for destruction or health, etc.  It is the most diverse class in nwn.  <br><br>TO be fair to endy's comparison, when you mix cleric/bard which opens rdd or pm, then you get a whole other world of hurt.<br><br>And last, what are saves?  Fort of 50, is that good?  When you REALLY understand clerics, saves become something noobs worry about.  I have played for a long time and have YET to worry about maximizing saves in a build.  Things just never lat that long to care. I guess it says something about your style of play when SAVES become the be all end all.  <br><br>No worries.  I will pray for your soul...

Saves are fairly important, and 50 IS high, spells can't reach it, only a few combat feats can best that, my best Stunning Fist had 63 DC, which is a DC to tremble against but it can still be saved with a fair chance if your save is 50 since you have 1d20 + save roll vs DC. I actually do pretty well in PvM because melee mobs tend to have lousy saves when it comes down to it, and mass area spells just as this build is intended to be used will nuke earth and beyond if they can't make the save, and I don't play the hardcorest (if that's a word) servers to see if getting owned is fun, it isn't for me. Works for PvP too, if you don't care about saves, any spellcaster will make short work of you. So grab this build, play it and watch for yourself. <br><br>Endalyor said the max possible base spell DC is lousy in practically any server. Well, obviously that's crap (yeah, "crap", Bioware forums censor the real word, but you what it should be).<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/05/09 20:27</span></i></p>

In that sense, yes, clerics are fantastic. However, the topic on hand is a cleric who focuses on spell casting, and in that sense, a spell that uses a DC is nothing compared to a maximized Isaac's Greater Missile Storm and a Bigby's Grasping Hand, which are both incredibly hard to resist. Compare this build to a pure sorcerer, we both know who will win.

Yeah, all builds need to be made so that they can beat Exhalted Sorcerer builds or else they're lousy. Sorcerers are great for PvP, that's far from the point.<br><br>A Cleric can withstand all your IGMS slots with just a few Heals, even more so if it's a Cleric with Healing Domain, but just a single Implosion that hits you and it's the end of the line. I find it ridiculous to say the best instant death spell in the game is not good, it even breaches death immunity.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/06/09 21:53</span></i></p>

endy... pvp is for the kids!  Everyone who knows anything about anything in this game is well aware that in pvp, igms sorcs and dragons are it.  It can be VERY hard for other classes to beat these.  NWN was never really balanced for pvp.  <br><br>with respect to your comment about spells, DUDE!  What are Divine Power? Divine Favor? Battletide? Prayer? Aid?  Oh, right, SPELLS!! When you talk about a caster cleric, you are really talking about a cleric, as when you get into playing one, EVEN if your intent was to use damage spells, you end up using these spells too!  Its what being a cleric IS!  Those who dont, unfortunately, dont get the cleric.  I know as i was one of those for a few years before i figured it out.   <br><br>Now, you talk about 50 being high dc.  I designed a cleric one time that had 47 implode DC with 19 wisdom (yes i could have pushed it up, but i decided to other things).  On a server that is considered HARD by good players, i was soloing and using implode on things way up in the highest areas.  It works.  Your ideas are flawed.  <br><br>Whast i suggest is you ONLY play some clerics for the next year.  Play every day.  Try out different things.  You will find that they are the most exciting class you could ever play.   IF you are a pvper, stick with the whine and cheese igms.  That way you can imagine you have a big whineer, when everyone knows its just the class.
