I think it is quite doable - as long as you don't mind getting SC V late in the build.<br><br>This takes 8 F levels in order to get enough feats to take the two weapon fighting tree as well - if that is not important to you, you could take more R and get the cool epic rogue feats earlier.<br><br>1 R Dodge<br>2 R<br>3 R Mobility<br>4 R<br>5 F Weapon Finesse<br>6 F Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialisation<br>7 F<br>8 F Expertise<br>9 F Spring Attack<br>10 F Whirlwind<br>11 F<br>12 W Ambidexterity* <br>13 W<br>14 W<br>15 W Two Weapon Fighting*<br>16 W<br>17 W<br>18 W Imp Two Weapon Fighting*<br>19 R<br>20 R<br>21 F Epic Weap Focus, Epic Weap Spec<br>22 R<br>23 R <br>24 R Toughness*<br>25 R Defensive Roll<br>26 R <br>27 R Great Dex<br>28 R Improved Evasion<br>29 R<br>30 R Great Dex<br>31 R Epic Dodge<br>32 R<br>33 R SC I<br>34 R SC II<br>35 R<br>36 R SC III<br>37 R SC IV<br>38 R<br>39 R SC V<br>40 R<br><br>Dex at every stat increase of course.  You need to cross class Intimidate up to 4 for your WM req and Hide and Tumble to 30 by level 31.  Rest is up to you.

Oops, too late to edit apparently - forgot you will be into epic rogue levels by the end - your final rogue bonus feat will be at 39, not 37.

You need to switch the Wep Specialization and Expertise feats.  You need 4 lvls of Fighter before you can take Specialization.  Also, Intimidate is a rogue skill, so you could put 4 pts into that at char creation, no need for cross classing.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

Wow, thanks a ton <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     I hadnt thought of doing it that way hehe. I just saw i forgot to add what weapon, how would you change this to add in a Kukri as the wpn spec? since it would require Exotic Wpns as a feat that would make me take 8 fighter to get. Hmm i think i got it, <br><br>1 R Dodge<br>2 R<br>3 R Weapon Proficiency (Exotic)<br>4 R<br>5 F Mobility<br>6 F Expertise, Spring Attack<br>7 F<br>8 F Whirlwind<br>9 F Weapon Focus (Kukri)<br>10 F Weapon Specialization (Kukri)<br>11 F<br>12 W Weapon Finesse<br><br>I went that way because on the server i play on, it takes 10-15 min to get to 12 or so so i thought it would work out <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Seipherwood on 03/23/05 14:22</span></i></p>

Weapon Spec doesn't need you to have 4 fighter levels, just to have BAB 4.  The 4 R levels at the start give you BAB 3, just one F level after that is enough.  But, as the poster can apparently turbo to 12 it doesn't matter much I suppose <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Quite right about the Intimidate.

Quite right Thruggsen, I am just so used to starting off with 5 lvls of Fighter when I make Wep Masters, that I got trapped into thinking you needed 4 fighter lvls.  Guess that's what happens when you get used to doing something a certain way, lol.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DarkStar27909 on 03/24/05 09:07</span></i></p>

Well, I'm prepared to believe you if you're that emphatic <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   I wasn't sure myself, checked a couple of online sources, they all say<br>Fighter, Weapon Focus, Base Attack Bonus +4<br>so I believed them.<br>Now that I check around more exhaustively it seems people are divided on the issue.  I apologise for not checking in game first (assuming you are actually right).

On wpn spec....there is a good and simple way to test....make a rogue(or any other no ftr char) and get to BAB 4 ensuring that you have a weapon focus in a weapon, then take a single ftr level preferably at lv 8 12, 16, 20 etc..<br><br>I doubt that you will be able to take wpn spec with that single ftr level.
