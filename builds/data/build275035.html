Remember the build has Damage Spells (IGMS, Horrids, Ice Storms, etc.), as well as Damage Resistance spells for low magic (And Epic Warding for anywhere), as well as Damage Shields and other goodies related to be a caster. Something I'd list as both a pro and a con is that this build has a MILLION ways to do things, so it might take awhile to find the right strategy for defeating your foe. As for items, anything that improves on pretty much any ability other than Intelligence will help you. CON especially should be mentioned, as this build as the HP from the depths of hell. Enjoy, and please leave advice if you have any.

Yeah, they do get it free. I forgot, was thinking they got it at 6 because of Great Cleave. So Cleave can be replaced with Blind Fight. As for CC, I've always been a fan of it, but...I suppose it could be replaced for something more useful. Knockdown, perhaps?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DragonRaider69 on 05/29/07 10:39</span></i></p>

I should also add that AB calculations were done as if Haste was applied. Non-hasted, take away the last attack.

Yeah, I could do that. Or I could drop CC for KD, take Epic Prowess, and take Divine Might in addition to that to gain back the damage (and more) that I lost(only for 11 rounds). Or I could grab IKD or Epic Fortitude as well(As the other feat if I took Epic Prowess, I mean). None of them would hurt, eh?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DragonRaider69 on 05/29/07 12:42</span></i></p>
