Hi all,<br><br>I'm looking for a decent build using the outline above, I know I'll be hit by experience penalty along the way but thats fine with me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Now, I'm not 100% sure if Wizard is better than Sorceror in this case but taking wizard allows me to get Imp Expertise and lets me leave CHA at 8 while taking sorc would give me more spells, easier metamagic and better turning ability but I would be low on skill points and would also have to invest in INT as well.<br><br>This build would be mainly a caster but with melee ability as it has both arcane and divine buffs.<br><br>I was thinking 23 Wizard/ 15 Cleric / 2 Bard<br><br>Info first off:<br>As soon as I take the bard level, I get access to an armor that has -50% ASF so i can use that studded leather + a large shield for no ASF at all.<br><br>This build's main focus is PvP with a decent PvM ability.<br><br><br>What I would like to request is:<br>I should start with cleric and take my wizard levels during epic right?<br><br>What would be decent starting stats?<br>I was thinking something like:<br>STR 10<br>DEX 8<br>CON 14<br>INT 16<br>WIS 16<br>CHA 8<br><br>Race Human, although Gnome could likely work as well.<br><br>I'm planning on getting following metamagic feats:<br>empower<br>maximize<br>silent<br>extend<br><br>Will try to get both Epic Mage Armor and Epic Warding as the world is low-mid magic.<br><br>Anyone willing to give suggestions overall to the build and/or build something like that for me?<br><br>Thanks in advance very much.<br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while

personally, I prefer sorcerer over wizard. But thats just because a sorcerer doesn't have to prepare their spells. I believe that the two get the same spells, so I would go towards the sorcerer. But I bet that their are plenty of people here to tell me that I am nuts <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

I'd say so.. just more versatile ya know.. more spells.. get's to be prepared for anything, more skill points.. 4 more feats than a sorceror. The only benefits I ever see in sorcs is that you can get the whole charisma bonus to your AC (divine shield) and saves.. but I do see wizards as superior as far as being prepared and ready is concerned.. they can tackle most anything but sorcs are invariably limited to pvp because they don't have a tonne of spells for different situations like wizards.. uhh and a lot of other junk I forgot <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>-DaMouse

Not because I only enjoy sorcerers (I do enjoy playing them, though I generally go wiz instead) but because you can end a sorcerer on a very hgih note.  Sure they lose 4 epic feats (and more pre-epic); but you don't need all the epic spells - most of them are crud anyway so you pick the ones most important to your build, like warding.  Divine shield can take care of epic mage armor (pre-epic); so no need to spend a grat cha or epic school focus on that.. wizards are more versatile true - but in most pvm battles you don't have the time to reshuffle and rest if it's a new area.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 07/08/05 08:11</span></i></p>

OK<br><br>Race Human<br>Clerical Domains:<br>Healing, Air<br><br>made the build with starting stats:<br><br>10 STR<br>10 DEX<br>14 CON<br>16 WIS<br>16 INT<br>8  CHA<br><br>ended with:<br><br>10 STR<br>10 DEX<br>14 CON<br>18 WIS<br>28 INT<br>8  CHA<br><br><br><br>Took feats:<br><br>Expertise<br>Improved Expertise<br>Spell penetration<br>Greater Spell penetration<br>Epic Spell penetration<br>Epic Spell: EMA<br>Epic Spell: EW<br>Armor Skin<br>Toughness<br>Blind Fighting<br>Empower<br>Combat Casting<br>Improved Combat Casting<br>Extend<br>Great Intelligence I-IV<br>Maximize Spell<br>Silent Spell<br><br><br>Pre-epic:<br>14 Cleric/6 Wizard<br><br>Epic:<br>1 Cleric / 17 Wizard / 2 Bard<br><br>Total:<br>15 Cleric / 23 Wizard / 2 Bard<br><br><br>BAB 24, 14 Pre-epic, 3 attacks base<br>4 attacks with Divine Power<br>---------------------- -----------------------------<br><br>Not much else I could possibly improve on this build except of course getting more INT and WIS <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br>I guess Blind Fighting isn't really necessary so any other proposals would be accepted with joy.<br><br><br><br>---------------------- ------------------------------<br><br>I did the same build CHA based and trying to get Divine Shield and all but didn't work out too well. Build was greatly lacking feats (4 feats...) and thus ended low with CHA and wasn't too useful overall although the spell selection was nice as Clerical spells could substitute for a great deal of sorceror spells.<br>I guess the main problem was getting 13/14 STR and INT in addition to keeping CHA and WIS reasonable.<br><br><br>please critique my build.<br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while
