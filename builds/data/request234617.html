Exploits come to me!<br><br>When you use divine power your BAB works as if it was 30, so, for example, a character with 15 BAB would get an extra attack, and that extra attacks works at full AB.<br><br>Ok, that's nice, but what if my BAB is 9? had you ever thought about it?<br><br>Sorcerer 20 / Monk 2 / Cleric 18 or something like that, 18 levels of sorcerer, 1 of monk and 1 of cleric on pre-epic give you an amazing 9 BAB, even lower than 20 sorcerer, so, that should give me more than just one attack, being a monk, 9 BAB = 3 APR, while 30 = 6...<br><br>Ok, I went on testing and, sadly, it doesn't works to its full.... with an AB of +36 after Divine Power, I attacked a combat dummy using Haste and Flurry of Blows (also having Improved Two Weapon Fighting using two kamas), and I got the following:<br><br>+34/+31/+28/+36/+36/+36/+36/+34/+29<br><br>Those are 9 attacks, not the 10 I was expecting, not sure what went wrong, but that is the fact, anyway, check that out, 4 attacks at +36, 2 at +34, 1 at +31, 1 at +28 and oddly 1 at +29, how did that got there? I made it several times and yeah, why does it gets a -5 between the last two attacks? it should be -3 because it's a kama on a monk....<br><br>Anyway, the average it's quite good, most of the attacks have practically the same percenage of hitting, instead of what normally happens leaving the last attacks with a very low AB.<br><br>It's a great buffer.<br><br>What I've been having troubles is: Status and feats.<br><br>I got this out, and I don't really like it.....<br>STR 14<br>DEX 14 (15)<br>CON 10<br>WIS 14 (19) used Great WIS I<br>INT 12<br>CHA 14 (19)<br><br>It's obvious why I don't like ending with 3 stats on an odd score, but I need 19 on both CHA and WIS to cast level 9 spells, 15 DEX for ambidexterity, INT enough for Tumble, Spellcraft and Concentration and 13+ STR for divine wrath and divine shield.<br><br>On the feats, "needed" are Weapon Focus, Epic Weapon Focus, Two weapon fighting, Ambidexterity, Improved two weapon fighting, Power attack for Divine Might and Divine Shield, Improved Critical, Extend Spell, Epic Prowess.... and don't get many extras, as well as IC and ITWF can't be taken pre-epic since BAB is too low for it, I'm not sure what else to take, Empower Spell? I couldn't take Epic Spells since my sorcerer doesn't gets to epic levels for them (while Epic Warding adnd Epic Mage Armor would be great).<br><br>HP is also low..... 240 with that CON. AC should be quite good though, since it can get AC from DEX, WIS and CHA, filled with buffs from both cleric and sorcerer.<br><br><br>I thought maybe on forgetting divine might and divine shield and take Wizard with low CHA, that would arrange a lot of stuff, some bonus wizard spells, no problem with skills, would get more abilities to spare from CHA, but losing the divine damage from divine might, and maybe it wouldn't get to be a strong melee as I think it can get without its divine damage, AC also goes down.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/22/06 23:15</span></i></p>

I have mentioned it in a few builds before, but the off-hand attacks do not follow monk progression. Hence the 29 instead of 31.<br><br>For the missing attack, I would guess that divine power only adds attacks as if you were a fighter and isn't fooled by monk progression. Test it with 1 weapon, first with flurry, then DP-only, then Haste only, then combine. If it is as I suspect, 10 BAB is better than 9.<br><br> It's an interesting exploit, but your AB is getting so low it ain't worth exploiting that much. It's worth it from 16 BAB to 15, or even in some cases from 17 to 15. If you lower it to 9 youæll only be doing your lowest attacks anyhow......<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 03/06/06 18:56:45 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br>Trollborn Asgardian by the master of the Norse legends, Grimnir himself!<br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

I did checked on single-handed, no change about it or anything.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;I have mentioned it in a few builds before, but the off-hand attacks do not follow monk progression.
