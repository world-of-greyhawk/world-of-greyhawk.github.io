This weekend, I got my Complete Warrior back from a friend of mine.  Flipping through it, I saw the Master Thrower PrC and wondered, "Hey, could this work in NWN?"  So I tried it out.  I made two versions -- this one, and a Fighter/Monk/BG version.  The second version turned out to be closer to the PnP PrC from a feats perspective, but this one is at least as effective, if not more.  If people want, I'll post that version in this thread later today.<br><br>Halfling, any Evil<br><br>Stats:<br>STR 12<br>DEX 18<br>CON 10<br>INT 14<br>WIS 8<br>CHR 14<br><br>Level Allocation:<br>Fighter x 4<br>Rogue x 8<br>Blackguard x 8<br>Fighter x 1<br>Rogue x 2<br>Fighter x 1<br>Blackguard x 5<br>Rogue x 3<br>Fighter x 8<br><br>Raise STR(4th), CHR (8th, 12th 36th, 40th), and DEX (16th, 20th, 24th, 28th, 32nd)<br><br>Feats:<br>Level 1: Weapon Focus: Dart, Point Blank Shot<br>Level 2: Rapid Shot<br>Level 3: Dodge<br>Level 4: Weapon Specialization: Dart<br>Level 6: Power Attack<br>Level 9: Cleave<br>Level 12: Called Shot<br>Level 15: Divine Might<br>Level 18: Toughness<br>Level 21: Great Dex I<br>Level 23: Improved Evasion<br>Level 24: EWF: Dart, EWS: Dart<br>Level 27: Divine Shield<br>Level 29: Epic Toughness I<br>Level 30: Great Dex II<br>Level 32: Defensive Roll<br>Level 33: Epic Dodge<br>Level 34: Armor Skin<br>Level 36: Epic Toughness II, Great Charisma I<br>Level 38: Blind-Fight<br>Level 39: Great Charisma II<br>Level 40: Epic Prowess<br><br>This build was tested in "Novice to Epic Character Maker CEP Edition".

The idea is to improve the build he thought out, not to point out which build would be better and all use that one.

Don't rely on that fiend to much. It will only be a level 12 summon and a weak one at that. It does offer a minor distraction to maybe get a few sneak throws in though.<br><br>Also Tyr, you really need to get a new life. The one you have is very sad.

When people post a build I imagine constructive critisism is wanted and even needed. TyrPaladin you seem to comment on peoples' builds in the wrong way. If someone's build is lacking in some areas just nicely post that they are. Don't belittle their build and say that you would rather use your own build then theirs. No one cares what build you would rather use. Just give a helpful comment and leave it at that. I don't have time to scroll through and read all the arguments you cause because it makes a simple thread become so long and pointless and you always seem to have to get the last word in.<br><br>Just stop and think for a second: if alot of people are getting upset by your posts you should probably change how you post. Majority rules I always say.

As much as I don't like tyr, I think she is correct ont he point blank shot with AoO. If you are not getting them while using a ranged weapon in melee, you have a decent rank in tumble or spring attack preventing them.

It really isn't if you have 20+ tumble. Also Tyr, your logic is flawed a bit with the AC thing. If you are going for the spring attack feat, the AC from mobility won't matter as you'll never have an AoO against you to have that come into effect. The builds that go the tumble route, usually are dex builds that have a very high AC, so 4 more points will usually end up in the opponent still needing a 20 to hit you.

I may not be sorting the thread from the mudslinging sufficiently to be on the right track here, but spring attack doesn't stop all AoOs, only those resulting from moving in/out of combat, ya?
