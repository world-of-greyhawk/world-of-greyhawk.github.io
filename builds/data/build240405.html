Rogue 13/Cleric 17/CoT 10<br><br>I believe this is my fourth or fifth run at this particular level split.  I think (think) that I have finally worked out a leveling guide that can hang in PvP.  Buffs are very dispellable but it's not like you are a total chump in that event.  Anyway, here is the latest and greatest for the multi-tasker.  Trapper. Sneaker. Buffer.

UEF - Undeath's Eternal Foe - grants bonus of +4 dodge AC for duration, multiple casts stack until your dodge AC hits the cap. which can be handy sometimes.

Hmm.  The only thing that stands out to me, aside from the halfling comments already pointed out, is that you have a Dex of 25 by level 24, but you don't get Epic Dodge until level 39.  If I were playing it, I would change leveling order to hit Rogue 13 by level 27 or so, and exchange 2 levels of CoT for more Rogue to pick up some skill dumps post level 27.  You get 12 more skill points, +1d6 sneak damage, <b>12 additional playable levels with Epic Dodge</b>, and you only lose 1 to saves and 1 feat.<br><br>Another comment about trickery domain, keep in mind that a Cleric/ Rogue (with Trickery) can out pick (both locks and pockets), out trap, and out stealth a pure Rogue.  That said, without enough Cleric levels to be undispellable, casting from scrolls in exchange for another domain is fairly attractive.<br>_________________<br>There's always time to procrastinate.

But you wouldn't be able to take Tumble to 40, just 25, so you'd cost yourself 3 AC.  If you were playing the OC -- where you are never going to get to forty -- I'd think about it very seriously.  But to dominate at 40, I'd keep that last rogue level late for the skill dump (set trap, too).  <br><br>The halfling idea is a good one, you could play around with the leveling without having to worry about the exp. penalty (which explains a lot of this build's permutations - very few levels are where they are by accident).  <br><br>Anyway, cheers.

Going Halfling would let you change the pre-epic level split to Cleric 12 Rogue 4 CoT 4.  This would, in turn, increase your Fort and Will saves by one without affecting your Reflex save.  Plus you'd add two points to Fort by Halfling Lucky and the extra point to Constitution.  It becomes a necessity, frankly.  <br><br>And the Halfling AB bonus would let you trade Epic Prowess for Great Fortitude, and then you'd be roughly immune to Dev Crit (Fort 53 with Epic Gear).  <br><br>No wonder there are so many darn halflings running about.<br><br>Ithacan
