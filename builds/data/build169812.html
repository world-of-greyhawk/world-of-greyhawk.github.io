Being a harper is just cool, but it is almost equally as cool doing high 30's to low 40's damage with shortswords vrs. favored enemies. As said before, this build is decent duel wielding, with a greatsword, or with a bow. You also have a companion running around with you dealing nice amounts of damage.<br><br>Changes:<br>For the powergamers out there, you can drop skill focus set trap, epic skill focus set trap, and a great dex feat. Instead you can take Great Cleave, Overwhelming Critical, and Devastating Critical. Also, if a player wants maximum damage, instead of focusing on shortswords, focus on greatswords.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 10/12/07 19:27</span></i></p>
