Hi, nice build. You can't go wrong with Clerics; and the WeaponMaster gives you some nice added melee punch.  I like your use of Rogue for both Tumble point dumps as well as getting the Rapier proficiency (nicely done, I had to double-check that one).  And, I assume that you went with 13 levels of Cleric pre-epic to make the most out of Divine Power (15 BAB pre-epic).<br><br>There are a couple of things I would do differently, though. And these are more differences in style, so take them with a grain of salt.<br><br>- First, I would dump BlindFight for a Metamagic feat; most likely Empower Spell.  While Blindfight is a great feat to have, it seems that you might be  able to get more mileage out of Empowered Bulls Strength / Endurance; using the spell True Sight or Invisibility Purge to deal with Concealed enemies.<br><br>- Second, I would drop Toughness for a Greater Strength. Yes Toughness is nice, but again, you are a Cleric so you can cast Endurance for the same or better, affect. Of course, you will end up with an odd Strength stat (27), but since you most likely be buffing it, it will come up even about half the time.<br><br>Again, these are just personal style choices so please take them as such.  All-in-all, it looks as if it could dish a nice bit of pain.<br><br>Cheers.

I disagree about dropping Blindfight - True Sight doesn't help against enemies with Self Concealment V or monks using Empty Body. Having Blindfight really helps against those types (reduces your 50% chance of missing to 35%, much better).<br><br>Toughness is expendable - if you want to pick up extend or empower I would put it there. Empower will let you get another 2 points out of Endurance, giving you the same final HP as unempowered endurance plus toughness, so maybe take that instead. Not bad either way. Nice build.<br><br>TM

From a powerbuild point of view, yes, Dev Crit is worth it (you dropped Toughness and Armor Skin, right?). <br><br>I don't like Dev Crit, though, it makes it too easy to kill things. You would have a DC of 38 or 44 with buffed str, on top of your 10-20 crit range. Except for crit-immunes and a few characters with all the fort boosting feats or tons of CoT levels or Paladin's with high Cha, it will work against most characters pretty often. I find it takes the challenge out of too many enemies and makes it boring.<br><br>TM

Looses level 9 spells, but brings 2 more AB (with epic prowess), or 1 AB and 2 AC (with armour skin).
