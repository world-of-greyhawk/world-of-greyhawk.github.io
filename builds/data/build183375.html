In this build the monk uses kama istead of traditional <br><br>unarmed strike, here is why: when using unarmed strike <br><br>slot for gloves will always be occupied by hins fist or <br><br>yellow rose, but when using kama this slot remains free <br><br>items like bracers of armor +10. Another good thing <br><br>about kama is that with improved two weapon fighting and <br><br>flurry of blows u can get as much as 8 attacks per round <br><br>and thats without mentioning great cleave great cleave !<br><br>Even though the average damage of a mundane kama is 8 <br><br>this build can make it do at least 70 damage a round and <br><br>with an enchanced kama the average damage is around 20 <br><br>which lets this build do 160 damage a round ! it has a <br><br>naked AC of 40 and with good items can be as high as 80! <br><br>casters will have hard time trying to beat a spell <br><br>resistence of 54 while 50% concealment and 40 Ac makes <br><br>sure that fighters will also have hard time.plus with <br><br>blinding speed this build becomes a hurricane of <br><br>destruction.

One minor problem with pure dex monks is that there is no way to preserve all that lovely dex and dodge based AC.  Which means that although ideal for 1 on 1 pvp fights, once surrounded by even mildly chllenging critters, that AC of 40 drops quite a lot.  To improve this I would mix in at least 2 (I think, cant find the SoU handbook at the mo) shadowdancer levels or 2 rogue levels which would give uncanny dodge and hence preserve the dodge and dex based AC on the char.

If you were going 2 shadowdancer , you might as well go for 5 levels of SD for defensive roll to qualify for epic dodge.<br><br>Syrath

Forget epic dodge or self concealment, they aren't really that important for a pure monk build (and impossible anyway in the case of epic dodge).  Empty Body is insanely useful to give 50% concealment for a fight or three, and you get two uses per day.  Since SC doesn't stack with Empty Body, it's only useful for a monk on a world with severe rest restrictions.  Strictly my opinion. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Who mentioned SC 5.

Well, I did specify "pure" monk above.  Pure monks can't get Epic Dodge--that's my story and I'm sticking to it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I personally have just found that Empty Body alone does well by my monks in the modules I play, so ED is not the "must have" that it would be for my rogue/SD builds.  Obviously it will be more desirable in a rest-restricted environment, or in environments where the high AC of a monk is irrelevant against the prevalent ABs, or in PvP environments.

Beware of parry.<br><br>1/ hits of 20 hit regardless of parry (but not of epic dodge)<br>2/ Parry only affects the first 3 attacks from an opponent (epic dodge only affects your target) so if a fighter (not your target) is attacking you, his last attack will always get through , more if hes dual wielding<br>3/ You can only riposte a maximum of 3 attacks only while parrying, if you had 11 attacks per round before if you hit parry, you just lost at least 8 of them.<br><br>Parry is not a skill you can go away and make a cup of tea. Only 2 things Ive seen do this - high DR and high AC /ED coupled with concealment(ive left the computer running for an hour with a fight between a 1000 hp goblin with 4 attacks per round and one of my builds with 70 AC , Epic dodge and Self Concealment 5. I think I saw about 3/4 hits land. I gave the goblin DR so my build couldnt damage him.<br><br>Syrath

If you want to make the char a truly ludricrous dex based combat monk then I would add in some fighter levels as well as the SD levels, hence gaining an extra attack/round and weapon spec.  At lv 20 it would be something like: Monk 12 Ftr 4 SD 4 and at lv 40: Monk 30 Ftr 5 (epic wpn spec) SD 5 (defensive roll and epic dodge).  Of course this would hamper the builds innate SR a bit, but you would get an extra attack and +6 damage/hit and a slightly better AB.

Sorry havent checked bioware in ages.<br><br>1st reply: DR is a problem that can only be solved by elemental damage kamas or by taking few lvls paladin, but then this build wont be monk at all.<br><br>2nd reply: If you dont want great cleave then do this:<br>at the beggining take to points from strength and put into intelligence. Then in feat guide replace power attack, cleave and great cleave with toughness, expertise and improved expertise, this is just to be activated when paladins and other warriors use AB and damage increasing short-term buffs,so that u can wait till they wear of.<br><br>3rd reply: Main idea of this topic was monk and your paladin build will loose such bonuses as immunity to mind spells(perfect self) and 2 lvls of SD wont let you have epic dodge, which is the main reason to have high dextertity
