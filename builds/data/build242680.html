You don't get 1d20 fists until level 32!</b><br>A:  Unfortunately yes, you have to rely on sneak attacks for a lot of your offensive punch, and you just overall trade damage for good defenses in this build.<br><br><b>Q:  Why not go dual kama then to generate a lot of sneak attacks?  Especially because of how slowly your fists mature?</b><br>A:  You can, and maybe should.  There are feats enough for it pre-epic, I just don't particularly like making dual kama builds.  This character would benefit from it alot however, I can't deny that.  I'm not enthusiastic about having an AB of under +40, however, so the dual wield penalties are a deterrent for me personally, beyond my dislike of kamas.<br><br><b>Q:  Which build do you think is better - strength or dex?</b><br>A:  They are two sides of the same coin really - the strength build has a good offense and a mediocre defense while the dex build has an excellent defense and a mediocre offense.  <br><br>I'm a fan of dex builds and epic dodge, but I think that in some environments the dex variant's offensive potential, even as a dual-kama build, may not be sufficient.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Xylophone on 06/03/06 07:59</span></i></p>

The build looks good, but I'm a little worried about the lack of offense.  Maybe in this case it would be better to take fighter instead of CoT to get WS/EWS and help out the damage.  Also I would probably switch out dodge for called shot.  It would probably work well in higher magic settings where your weapon does most of the damage.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
