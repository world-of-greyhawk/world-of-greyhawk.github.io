Havent seen to many half orc builds here, and the search engine searches class not race (not a knock btw, damn cool search engine).<br><br>Anyways the PW Ive been away from the game for years, and between other games and Dungeons and Dragons Online, Ive forgotten what little I knew about building characters.<br><br>I can tell you what I want/cant have, and hopefully you can provide some direction so I can flesh out a build (which will then be picked apart by you experts).<br><br>Henri Tard is the characters name.  Half Orc of limited intelligence (I hope I can minimize intel or Ill have to rework the backstory a bit).<br><br>PW doesnt allow Dev Crit, its a medium magic world (I should have access to some decent gear).  The following is a link to the gear if you care to see what I mean by medium magic.<br><a href="http://soulforge.ipbhost.com/index.php?showtopic=7" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br>Id like taunt, terrifying rage, damage resistance.  If possible Id like to do without KD, IKD, Disarm, Parry, or Called shot type skills.  I figure with a lowered intell id probably have to anyways.<br><br>Monsters cover a wide range from your standard, rats, goblins, orcs, and spiders at lower levels to vampires (and other high end undead), beholders, dragons, and drow and early epic to end game.<br><br>Im not looking for someone to build it for me (although anyone interested is welcome to take a shot).  But some direction on what to multiclass with, and perhaps must have feats (I know the standars like wf, ewf, prowess, specialization, etc.).<br><br>One weapon thats caught my eye is (this is absolute top end epic extremely rare, Ill be super lucky If I can beg borrow or steal one, but...):<br>Raging Blizzard: Greataxe +6, Attack Bonus +10, Damage Bonus: Cold 1d10, On Hit: Slow DC 26 50% / 2rounds. CILR: Requires 30 Barbarian levels<br><br>Meaning 30 barbarian, and 10 classes open.  From what Ive read its hard to have a decent AC with barbarian, so Id be better off focusing damage resistance? Taunt, and terrifying rage to help with damage mitigation?<br><br>Any suggestions for the other 10 classes?

The first thought that comes to mind would be 28 barbarian 2 bard 10 rdd. The rdd will give a little extra ac,adds 8 str,immune to fire, parailize and such. So if you start out with 18str add 8 from rdd 10 from lvln up you end with 36 str, pretty good ab that way. Do 20 barb putting skills in disc heal and taunt , save what ya can at 21 take 1 bard lvl and throw 20 in tumble for ac, then take 10 rdd then 8 barbarian. End with bard max tumble at 40 for +8 ac max disc at 43 and taunt at 43. I haven't done any math just quick response but if you can fit them esf disc and esf taunt might be good feats for this build. Depending on the pw you play on you may want to rearange the lvl progression i play on a pvp world so AB is all important to me it may not be for you, getting rdd lvls earlier may be the ticket. Anyways have fun playing that's all that matters.<br>                                 Xaentian(Mobius)<br>                    Elp!!!! I'm Bleedin Eavy!!!!

Ive been mostly playing PvP on Bastions of War, my concern off the top would be 2 bard doesnt seem like much help.  Short term buffs on a PW dont mean much if anything.  Also would like to try and get to 30 Barbarian.  How about 30 Barb, 1 bard, 9 RDD?  <br><br>I could take the Bard and RDD late allowing skill dump into tumble at bard.  Plus if I ever luck into that nice lookin greataxe I will be in good shape.<br><br>Any reason I couldnt max strength from the start.  Seems thats one of the best reasons to take a Half Orc, starting str of 20...<br><br>Thanks for taking the time to reply.  I didnt really put out a build here.  So helping me troubleshoot the concept from the start is awful nice.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By he-hate-me on 10/19/06 00:51</span></i></p>

I'm liking the sound of that Axe.  30 seems like it's definitely in order.  I would suggest then, doing something like Barb32/Ftr4/Rogue4.  And while there is a temptation to start with a 20 Strength, I think you'll do fine if you start with an 18.<br><br>Pre-epic Barb18/Rogue2.  No Xp Penalty.  <br><br>That will give you 13 Feats to play with in Epic.  5 of those will be bonus feats, which will cover Armor Skin (a must have feat for any Barb), Epic WF and WS/Epic WS, Epic Prowess, and 1 EDR.  Feats you'll still need are Terrifying Rage, EDR II, EDR III, and 4 Great Attribute Feats.<br><br>In starting such a build (I tend to play a lot of characters like this), I go:<br><br>Str18 (28)<br>Int10<br>Wis8<br>Dex8<br>Con18 (22)<br>Chr6<br><br>You'll essenitally have enough skill points to fill Tumble, Taunt, Discipline, Intimidate, with about a score left to drop into UMD. Pre-epic feats need to include Weapon Focus, Blindfighting, Knockdown, Improved Crit, Toughness.<br><br>Your AC issue is addressed by Fighter's heavy armor proficiency, as well as by the high Con and DR 17/-.  You'll have naturally between 700-800 hit points, and be one healthy mofo.  <br><br>You're Will and Reflex saves wont be the greatest, but something's gotta give if you want to be a Machine of Destruction.  <br><br>I use a more a balanced approach than the one I just outlined, and it's a Barb17/Rogue13/CoT10.  He still gets EDRs, but loses the Damage contest.  He makes up for it with superb defense by having much highre saves, Imrpoved Evasion, Sneak damage, sword &amp; board, and better UMD skill.  A compromise betwee the 2 would be Barb24/Rogue6/CoT10, with just losing Improved Evasion bsaically and gaining another combat feat in Epic.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Obviously I need to take at least one rogue late (38ish IIRC) for a tumble/UMD skill dump.  Any other key levels for Fighter or Barbarian before I plan out the 21-40 route?  Or can I pretty much just take em as I want?  4 fighter for the ws and ews?  Can I just take those 21-24 (plus that gives me the heavy armor early and I might find I need it)?  <br><br>Add in a rogue say 28-30ish for a mid character progression tumble (30)skill dump?  Then the rest barb cept for that 38ish tumble (40) skill dump?  <br><br>Thanks alot this is the build Im going to run with btw.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By he-hate-me on 10/19/06 14:50</span></i></p>

I would start with Rogue1 at first level if you can get away with it.  It will allow you to start with 32 skill points.  Your AC will suck for that level, but you'll pick up medium armor and shields at Level2 when you take your first Barb level.  However, you still don't have heavy armor.  We'll get to that in a bit.<br><br>Take Rogue2 at Level 12 for another Tumble/UMD skill dump, Rogue3 at Level 22, and Rogue 4 at Level 37.  You'll need to keep Fighter levels within 1 of Rogue to avoid XP penalties.  <br><br>Now, the reason to postpone all Fighter levels until Epic is to use Fighter bonus feats to acquire Epic Feats like EWF and Armor Skin.  Fighter level 4 needs to be take on a general Feat level (either 24 or 27) so that you can take both WS and EWS.  Your 3 Barb bonus feats will be for either all 3 EDRs or 2 EDRs and Terrifying Rage.  If you take 1 Fighter pre-epic, you get Heavy Armor for free, but then you lose that bonus feat you need in Epic.  Let's see...<br><br>1 Rogue1, Knockdown<br>2 Fighter1, WF: Weapon<br>3 Barb1, Blindfighting<br>4 Barb2, Str19<br>5 Barb3<br>6 Barb4, Iron Will<br>7 Barb5<br>8 Barb6, Str20<br>9 Barb7, Improved Crit<br>10 Barb8<br>11 Barb9<br>12 Rogue2, Power Attack, Str21<br>13 Barb10<br>14 barb11<br>15 Barb12, Cleave<br>16 Barb13, Str22<br>17 Barb14<br>18 Barb15, Toughness<br>19 Barb16<br>20 Barb17, Str23<br>21 Fighter2, EWF, Great Str I<br>22 Rogue3<br>23 Fighter3<br>24 Fighter4, WS,EWS, Con19<br>25 Barb18<br>26 Barb19<br>27 Barb20, Great Con I<br>28 Barb21, Str25<br>29 Barb22<br>30 Barb23, Great Con II<br>31 Barb24, EDR I<br>32 Barb25, Str26<br>33 Barb26, Terrifying Rage<br>34 Barb27<br>35 Barb28, EDR II<br>36 Barb29, Great Str II, Str 28<br>37 Rogue4<br>38 Barb30<br>39 Barb31, Armor Skin<br>40 Barb32, EDR III, Con22<br><br>So, the only feat that we miss is Epic Prowess.  What I would do is postpone Fighter 1 until Epic, and take Heavy Armor as a feat pre-epic (level 3), and drop Power Attack and Cleave, and add maybe Lightning Reflexes in place of Cleave.  This will allow you to take the full range of melee feats one needs in Epic levels of play.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Thanks Griz.  Didnt expect you to role out a build that detailed, but much friggin appreciated.  Ive posted your build and suggestions in the Soul Forge forums (the PW Ill be playing it on).<br><br>Really much appreciated.  It will be nice to roll with a character thats planned out well versus winging it.
