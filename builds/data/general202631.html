Don't you think that it's about time for us Epic Character Builders to create our own PW? Or a module at least? If we made a PW it should be like a giangantic Training hall or something (theres a thousand of us here so it needs to be pretty big). But instead of putting Dragons to boost you all the way to 40, and treasure chest that give you 9,999,999 gold everyone should be made to work for their stuff.TO level up we should have combat dummies to practice, on for level 1-5, and then when our levels get past that we should be able to fight each other for expierence. I've went to places online where you fight each other over and over, but never earn xp for it. And you should be able to get gold accordinly based on your wins and whatnot. And we should have tons of items. not just items that you find in the game, but custom item's to. And all of the armor and weps should have unique names beside leather armor +1. If anybody wants to do this, I would be more than happy to help in anyway possible.

I know that tons of things like this have already made, but I think that we can make the most realistic one.

There is a place with heavy pvp where you have to earn your stripes and all the gear is custom. It's a mod in the PW Story section called Athas Reborn based in the old Darksun setting from AD&amp;D 2'nd edition. Picture a cross between LOTR and Mad Max and you have a pretty good idea of what your in for. You start out as a slave with nothing but the rags on your back and fight until recognized and recruited by one of the guilds, and that's where the real fun starts as you organize guild raids and participate in war for hire. I've been there for three years only to be bored with every other place I visit.<br>Check it out at: <br><a href="http://athasreborn.com/forum/index.php?sid=f201acc3fe7d0db4dac14476cea78aa1" target="_blank">Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Deltutammatre on 07/04/05 22:56</span></i></p>
