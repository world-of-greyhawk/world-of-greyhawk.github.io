Generally speaking, when you are taking moderate-BAB classes (all 3 classes above are moderate BAB, check the table in the back of the manual), you want to take them in multiples of 4.  Meaning that you'd do better to do something like Cleric 16/Druid 4, or Cleric 8/Druid 8/Shifter 4, or something like that.  <br><br>Second, you get more skill points if you take Druid as your first level, although I have heard that the first class chosen is the one that counts as your caster level when casting spells in shifted form.  Still, the only form that you'll likely be using to cast would be Illithid, so I probably would put Druid first for the extra skill points.  <br><br>Also, I really don't think it's worth it to gimp your stats in order to get a decent Cha score.  My recommendation would be that if you want to do a Cha build, start with your stats like this:<br><br>Str 14<br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 14<br>Wis 14<br>Cha 14<br><br>Not the most Uber setup, but it IS efficient, in that you get the highest total stat points at creation.  Next, pump 5 points into Wisdom and 5 points into Cha.  Then, take a few Great Cha feats (3 to be exact) and you will have an ending Cha of 22, only 2 points lower than before, and you just gained +4 Con and +2 Int (lost a point of Wis though; oh well).<br><br>Also, I would go into a little more detail about your skills; I generally don't just put stuff "wherever".  Useful skills include Concentration, Discipline, Hide, Move Silently, Heal, Tumble, Spellcraft, Search, and even Lore or Animal Empathy.  <br><br>Note that Hide and Move Silently are useful primarily in shifted form (think Kobold Commando) as you will be wearing armor in human form.  If you want to revise the build I would calculate your total skill points and then figure out where you want to put them.     <br><br>Another thing I don't quite understand is why you don't go for more Epic shapes.  Sure, you would have to drop your Cha a little to get the requisite Wisdom (25 Wis, 16 Cha, assuming you use the starting stats I posted above), but you could easily get Outsider Shape, which would give you the Rakshasa form which makes you IMMUNE to all spells of 8th lvl or lower (also can cast Dispel Magic, Ice Storm, and Mestil's Acid breath an unlimited # of times).  <br><br>Alternatively, if you want to focus on the Risen Lord shape, you really only need 10 Shifter levels (theoretically you need to be an Epic Shifter, but you can actually take 1 Epic shape on the 10th level as long as you meet the other requirements). <br><br> Thus, you could do something like Druid 15/Cleric 15/Shifter 10, and end up with a lot more spells, a stonger animal companion, and what not.  Since you would only be getting 8th lvl spells with this build you could drop your Wis to 18, which would free up a point or two for other things. <br><br>Additionally, you could even go for Dev. Crit. if you wanted it.  Granted, you'd only have a 10% chance of threatening a critical each attack (unless you were to find a scythe with the Keen property on it, or find someone to cast Keen Edge for you), but it would still make you dangerous since you could potentially kill an opponent in one shot as long as they weren't Crit Immune (and of course you would be).  <br><br>Of course, you'd have to drop your Cha in order to raise your Str, so you couldn't really make effective use of Divine Might/Power if you went this route, but it still might be worth it.  <br><br>Additionally, if you went Druid 15/Cleric 15/Shifter 10, you could cast Extended Aura of Vitality as an 8th lvl Druid spell, meaning you wouldn't even need the War Domain to get all the buffs you wanted.  <br><br>If you wanted to be REALLY agressive, you could drop your Cha down to 8 or 10 and get ALL the Epic forms, including Outsider, Construct, Undead, and Dragon form.  That way, you could make good use of your Epic Shifter feats rather than spending them on Energy Resistance (BTW, you DO know that you can take Great Wisdom on Epic Shifter feats, right?).

CrispyCritter .<br>I think you and I will have to agree to disagree <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br>The build I have done is to use unlimited shapes combined with the benefits of cleric.<br>What you have provided are various alternatives but I do not see how they would get the same attack, AC, and damage that is the intention of this build.<br><br>I dont see how it is in-efficient when I can average +50 AB, 50 AC, and combine 17 divine and magical damage for all greater wildshapes,humanoid and undead.<br>The attack for Drow is 52/52/52/47/42 without empowered Bull strength.... Pretty good I would say <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br>The only downside is the use of only 3 undead, but at least I can use the other shapes now.<br><br>While the use of the 12/5/3 is pretty bad, it means that its possible to play the class without being crazily weakened and is needed to get Undead at level 27.<br>The combination as it stands also ensures no exp penalties will occur while levelling 10 shifter levels.<br><br>Regarding saves, well there are the cleric spells and the shapes to help there.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By lala_truthsayer on 02/16/05 20:34</span></i></p>
