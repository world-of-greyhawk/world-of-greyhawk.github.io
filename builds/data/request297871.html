I don't think a Con based AA has been done before. Is it for the hitpoints only or do you want Epic damage reduction as well? <br>If you take a high number of AA lvls (like you suggest), you can get a fair AB even if you neglect Dex.<br>Half elf has better Con than elf. None of them gets xp penalty with fighter/wizard. With cross classed tumble, low Dex and no shield, the AC will not be the greatest and depends on medium or heavy armor<br><br>You could aim at fighter 9/wizard 1/AA10 at lvl 20. There should be more than enough pre epic feats with all the fighter lvls. Take the 10th fighter lvl in epic lvls for EWS longbow.<br>Epic feats include Great Con, EWF, Epic prowess, Armor skin and Epic damage reduction I-III.<br><br>Starting stats for Half elf could be: str 14, dex 16, con 16, Int 12, wis 8, cha 8<br>That way your Con should be 21 by lvl 20.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 06/18/08 08:45</span></i></p>

I found this <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117554", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>this Wiz 1 / Ftr 10 / AA 29</a>, but of course he's str &amp; dex based.<br>Elves have -2 to Con, so you'll have to pick HE as class - poor choice IMHO.<br>Con based... Well, AA get very good AB with Imbue Arrow but I don't see how Con fits here.<br>In epic you can access EDR, but usually archers try to stay away from the battlefield.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Valeren on 06/18/08 08:45</span></i></p>
