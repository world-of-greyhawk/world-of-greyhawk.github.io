I was wondering if I could get some help making a build that  utilizes both the Assassin's Death Attack and the Ranger's Bane of Enemies. First, for my build to work the way I want it to (dex-based), I need to know if Death Attack can be used with ranged weapons. If not, then I'll work around it with another weapon type.<br><br>My biggest road block is knowing when to choose certain levels in order to maximize the feats/skills/etc I can get out of the build. Also, I'm not really clear on how many levels to take in which class. I know that the damage dealt by Death Attack increases with the more levels of Assassin you take, but when does it start to get pointless to take more levels in it? Also, I know I need at least 20 levels in Ranger to get 5 favored enemies (as far as I know) so that I can get Bane of Enemies. Is there an advantage to taking more than 20 levels in Ranger for this buid?<br><br>Once I get this straightened out a little, I'll post my build to have it critiqued. (probably more like torn apart <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> ) I know this is a little vague, but I hope I can get some help anyways. If it helps any, I intend to play this PvM up to level 40, probably as an Elf. (again, if I need to change from dex-based, I may go Human instead)<br><br>Thanks in advance for any help/suggestions! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>If all else fails, just nod and smile.

Couple of points:<br><br>1) BoE requires Epic Ranger, i.e. 21st level minimum<br>2) DA works with Ranged Weapons<br>3) I'd suggest a Ranger/Assassin/SD or Ranger/Assassin/Rogue, to get Epic Dodge (SD requires 10 levels, Rogue 13)<br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a>

OK, good, so I can go with a dex-based build. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">  So, for starters, I'll work on a 21/10/9 Ranger/SD/Assassin build and play with the levelling a bit. Does it matter what order I level them, other than how qwuickly I get BoE?<br><br>Thanks for the help, BTW. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>If all else fails, just nod and smile.

It really depends on what you want to focus on.  If you want a high AB, then go heavy on the Ranger pre-epic.  If you want Epic Dodge ASAP then you have to go heavy on Rogue/SD right away.<br><br>Is this a build that will be played up to 40, or instant 40?  Planning for survival as you level is different than just focusing on a lvl 40 build.

Giving it more thought, I wonder why you want to combine Assassin and Ranger. Both classes get better the more levels you take, so it really doesn't work that great. Your DA DC will be ridiculously low with 9 Assassin levels, 19 +INT modifier. I'd rather go with Rogue than Assassin, for example check my <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "242940", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Halfling Woodsman</a> build.<br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a>

Your damage bous to your FE is tie to your RGR levels as well. +1 at level 1, +2 at level 5, and +1 every 5 levels thereafter. Therefore, it's of more utility to take as many RGR levels as you can in order to get the best damage.<br><br>As Finn noted, both RGR and Assn need a lot of levels to be effective. I'd advise either dropping Assn for Rogue (as suggested), or taking only a few RGR levels and concentrating on Assn (something like the Dark Stalker build).<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...

OK, it kind of seemed like it was a bit of a stretch trying to fit in a bunch of ranger and assassin levels. Since DA can be used with ranged weapons, I guess I really don't need to focus much on BoE. I would like to take some ranger levels early so I can get the FEs and the animal companion, but we'll see how that all works out.<br><br>To answer your question, Bromium, this will be a build that is played up to level 40, so I am looking to be able to survive well during the middle levels. Also, I am going to be relying on high DA damage and high AB to be able to hit most characters. Also, to stay alive, I will be relying on enemies not being able to see/hit me at all. Hopefully I can get my saving throws up there as well, but I'll worry about that once I get my character straightened out. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif"> <br><br>So, it looks like I will be making a character more along the lines of a 24/10/6 Assassin/SD/Ranger build. This way, I will have a better DA, 2 FEs, and an Animal Companion. Thanks again to everyone for your help, and please let me know anything else you're thinking about how this is set up so far. Since I also want to get most defensive feats sort of early so I can survive, as well as get DA fairly early so I can start dealing more damage, I would appreciate some suggestions on how to do that. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>If all else fails, just nod and smile.

Here's one I posted in the General forum a couple days ago. It's based on the Dark Stalker build and is tweaked to the specs of a guy that wanted it for his server.

No, KD does not work with a ranged weapon.<br><br>A few things: If you're using a bow, why not a longbow? Also, I highly recommend you pick up Point Blank Shot and Rapid Shot. If you're Hasted, this will give you 6 attacks per round with your bow.<br><br>The Fort and Will saves are woeful, but you can pretty much cover Will saves with your UMD (scrolls of Prot fr Evil/Good, Clarity, Mind Blank, etc). The Fort save could be bolstered with the Epic Fort feat (more about that in a minute).<br><br>You're finishing with an odd-numbered ability (35 DEX), which is a bit of a waste. I recommend dropping the GRT DEX V feat at level 39 and replacing it with Epic Fortitude or Armor Skin (or something else if you want). <br><br>INT 15 does nothing for you. Drop it to 14 and invest those 2 extra points in either CON or STR. (If it matters to you, the -1 modifier from your low STR will mean -1 damage from your arrows)<br><br>Ditch Spring Attack.

Looks pretty good. Only two further tweaks for you to consider:<br><br>1) Add 2 more points to Disable. With 'take 20', that will give you a 58, which means you can disarm epic traps.<br><br>2) I'd drop Imp Crit and Called shot to pick up Point Blank Shot and Rapid Shot. With PBS, instead of the -4 penalty to hit at close range, you actually get +1 to hit <i>and</i>damage when close up. Rapid Shot gives you -2 to hit on all attacks*, but gives you an extra attack per round at full AB. With Haste, that's 6 attacks per round, 3 of them at full AB.<br><br>*remember, this can be alleviated by PBS's +1 at close range.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...

Cool, I made the changes you suggested, and now I'll post the build to have others critique it. Tanks for all your help, especially for explaining the details of why you suggested the various changes. Hopefully I won't need as much help with my next build, though. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>If all else fails, just nod and smile.

Crap! Good catch Bromium. Sorry, Dumediat, I believe I steered you wrong on the trap skills. I'm too used to using Rogue I guess.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...

I'm almost sure the Assasin levels counter that. They are basically an extention of the Rogue, attaining most of the primary abilities of it, as well as the same fundamental skills. I think it would make sense at least. Don't quote me though.
