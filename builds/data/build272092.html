<b>A Stunning Bastard</b><br>Rogue17/CoT 22/SD 1<br>Elf<br>Any Non-Evil<br><b>PvP 40 only</b><br><br>This one is inspired by Grizzled Dwarflord's <i>Shadowboxer </i> <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "221720", "0", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> which broke the mold on non-monk stunners. Sure a monk can stun you, but then what?  A rogue stuns you and you've got a world of hurt coming. Cheers, Grizzled One.  <br><br>This one sells out a bit more for a higher DC on the stun.  You could let go of 4 DC for Armor Skin and Epic Prowess (2 DC each).  It also gets significantly better saves due to the CoT class and has the one-time option per rest of Divine Wrath (if you have max charisma gear).  This would work best on a high-magic PW.  <br><br>Str 8<br>Dex 18 to 26<br>Con 12<br>Int 12 <br>Wis 16 to 20<br>Cha 8 <br><br> <br>1: Rogue 1 – Dodge<br>2: Rogue 2 <br>3: Rogue 3 - WFinesse <br>4: Rogue 4 - Dex 19<br>5: Rogue 5<br>6: Rogue 6 – WF Rapier <br>7: Rogue 7<br>8: Rogue 8 – Wis 17<br>9: Rogue 9 – Imp.

Um..where are you getting Stunning First from?  I thought only Monks got that for free.

Only Monks get it free, but anyone can get it if they meet the requirements. The thing I like about that is the DC is based on character level, not class level. That means my shiny new Monk/Psionic PC is going to have a respectable Stunning DC because she is WIStastic, even though I only want 11 Monk levels. Miserable AB though.

Thanks for the homage, Ith.  These kind of cats are a different breed.<br><br>You mention this would be best for a high magic PvP world, but I disagree.  I think it would be best for a low.  This is mostly due to AB, for there really is no way for him to keep up with ACs associated with such worlds, plus people are more likely to have some kind of immunity to stun via class, spell or item.<br><br>I think he would shine in a low magic environment, and would be a fun chap to have in a party.  I think he wouldn't have to worry about AB that much, AC would take care of itself, and he could fully commit to those ISFs.  Only think would be to shuffle a few things to get ED a bit earlier, but then we're talking 1-40, which is the only way my old brain can think.<br><br>Nice work, Ith.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
