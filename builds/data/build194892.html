<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM + PvP Build</b><br><br>Here's a build to consider: <br><br>The Harper Negotiator is a special agent of the harpers who is sent, when all else fails, to settle disputes, hostage crisis situations, uprisings, and to offer peace proposals between enemies. With an unprecedented 30 in Persuade skill and his Eagle Splendour powers, he can tell a man to "go to Hell" and make him look forward to going. However, when negotiations break down, the Negotiator still has one more tool of Persuasion-- his deadly daggers. He is highly "persuasive" with these. Although he doesn't deliver devastating criticals, you can be assured that enemies will rarely even touch him. With his high AB and AC (and even higher when he Cat's Graces himself x2), he is a turbulent shadow that leaves moans of pain and entrails in his wake. He can effortlessly avoid every attack, and then, when Hasted, deals 7 attacks of his own. If he is dealing a sneak attack, each dagger will have added 13d6 damage to each stroke of the blade.<br><br>Build Highlights: <br>Epic Dodge and Self-Concealment, and taken very quickly in the build<br>Sneak Attacks: 13d6<br>Good AC<br>Good AB<br>Harper and Halfling Save Bonuses, Tymora's Smile<br>Can self-buff with Invisibility and Cat's Grace, and can make his own potions<br>High Set Traps<br>UMD<br><br>Title: Harper Negotiator<br>Race: Halfling<br>Class: Rogue/Fighter/Harper<br>Levels: 25/10/5<br>Alignment: Neutral<br>Hit Points: 280<br>Naked AC: 30 (31)<br>AB: 40/35/30/25/40/35(17-20/x2)<br>Skill Points: 350<br><br><br>Str: 12<br>Int: 14<br>Wis: 8<br>Dex: 20 (34)<br>Con: 10<br>Chr: 8<br><br>Saves<br>Fort: 22 (24)<br>Reflex: 33 (36)<br>Will: 19 (21)<br><br>Skills:<br>Persuade: 30<br>Set Traps: 40<br>Search: 25<br>Discipline: 30<br>Tumble: 40<br>Hide: 43<br>Move Silently: 42<br>Disable Traps: 30<br>Open Locks: 20<br>Listen: 20<br>UMD: 24<br>Lore: 6<br><br>1) Rogue 1, Strong Soul<br>2) Fighter 1, Weap Fin<br>3) Fighter 2, Ambidexterity, Weap Focus Dagger<br>4) Fighter 3, Dex 21<br>5) Fighter 4, Weapon Specialization, Dagger<br>6) Rogue 2, TWF<br>7) Rogue 3,<br>8)  Rogue 4, Dex 22<br>9) Fighter 5, Knockdown<br>10) Fighter 6, Improved TWF<br>11) Rogue 5, <br>12) Rogue 6, Improved Crit Dagger, Dex 23<br>13) Rogue 7<br>14) Rogue 8<br>15) Rogue 9, Iron Will<br>16) Fighter 7, Dex 24<br>17) Rogue 10, Improved Evasion<br>18) Fighter 8, Improved Knockdown, Alertness<br>19) Rogue 11<br>20) Rogue 12, Dex 25<br>21) Fighter 9, Epic WF<br>22) Fighter 10, EWS<br>23) Harper 1, Great Dex I(26)<br>24) Rogue 13, Dex 27, Defensive Roll, Epic Dodge<br>25) Harper 2<br>26) Harper 3<br>27) Harper 4, Great Dex II(28)<br>28) Harper 5, GreatDexIII(29), Dex 30<br>29) Rogue 14<br>30) Rogue 15, SC I<br>31) Rogue 16, SC II<br>32) Rogue 17, Dex 31<br>33) Rogue 18, SC III<br>34) Rogue 19, SC IV<br>35) Rogue 20<br>36) Rogue 21, Dex 32, SC V<br>37) Rogue 22<br>38) Rogue 23,<br>39) Rogue 24, Great Dex IV(33), Slippery Mind<br>40) Rogue 25, Dex 34<br><br><br>Regrets: In a build like this, I like to get Expertise and Improved Expertise. It is still feasible by dropping TWF feats and going with a short sword, in addition to picking up Blind-fighting/Toughness.  However, I don't think his AC will ever be an issue. Spellchuckers would be the bane of this guy. Demi-liches would be difficult, methinks. He still has Traps and some UMD to fall back on. Slippery Mind might actually be worth taking early on, and just bump SC feats a little further down the line..<br>_________________<br>"Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace 'accidentally' with 'repeatedly,' and replace 'dog' with 'son.'"  ----Lionel Hutz<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/14/07 13:44</span></i></p>

well demi liches are hard for anybody without magical equipment because of the DR, dexters just cant hit hard enough to overcome it where as a Pal/cot type char can pretty much smite once and kill it.<br><br>Love the build, I really like concept builds in general, I could have liked to see points in appraise and intimidate as well but I guess you cannot have it all.

One possible idea:<br><br>Drop Strong Soul, pick up Weapon Proficiency: Exotic, and use kukris instead of daggers.  It's a personal preference thing, but I like the extra crit range (especially early on) in exchange for just 1 point from the saves that are frankly never going to be good anyway.<br><br>Steve

I did some calculations on the dagger/kukri comparison. <br><br>If your opponent has 10 more AC than your AB then out of 120 attacks you gain 2 more criticals than with the dagger(10 instead of <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"> . Hardly worth the outlay of the feat IMO. If you require less than 10 to hit your opponent do you really need the higher critical range anyway.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

Just a few questions.  I'm not a good builder, so I hope these questions are of relevance/make sense:<br>I'm not sure I see the benefit of the knockdown, would expertise+imp expertise not be better for this build?  Reason being; is that with your bab you're not going to be knocking down the things that _can_ get through your ac (I would think).<br><br>Second; maybe swapping a grt dex for epic focus: umd would help a little on the equipment side (a lot of the better 'epic' kit will need 50 or better umd to use; epic f:umd will give you about 52 with your lower cha).<br><br>Third; would this not work better with an elf using COT instead of fighter?  Elf can dualwield shortswords with same penalty as halfling+daggers, and there would be no xp penalty (I know halfling would have none anyway as rogue is favoured, just thinking out loud on elf options) It would be taken later; sure, but you could still fit the same feats (I think?) and get the same benefits as you would for fighter wouldn't you?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 05/13/05 10:11</span></i></p>

That's clear enough for me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> .<br>My point on knockdown was; if you're waiting for 20's to knockdown then you're going to miss a lot.. even if you get 20 once every 6 or 7 rounds; that's 5 or 6 rounds you've reduced your chances to hit.  Instead; you could go into Improved expertise and with epic dodge + sc5, even if your opponent gets two 20's in a round, you will take no damage on one; and get 50% chance of the other missing.<br><br>Just trying to get my head around knockdown with a low-ab build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">

Thanks for the responses.  <br><br>First, raising UMD.  There are enough to skill points to do whatever you want really.  This is just a template.  I would not suggest taking Epic Skill Focus in UMD.  25-30 is plenty.  Further, you would have to lose a feat in Epic, and there's not one i would remove.<br><br>Syrath covered pretty much the rest. Thanks.  Steve mentioned the Kukris.  If you look at the original on the General Forum, you'll see that was indeed my intention.  Kukris baby, which can still be done in the build.<br><br>I still sthink Impr Exp is a good way to go.  Drop the TWF feats, focus on shortsword.  This would reduce you to 4 instead of 6 attacks, but your AB would go up to 42/37/32/37, and you could effectively make your Naked AC go uo to 41, and still have a plain shortsword with 32AB.  With a few well-placed items, not even high magic items, you could rocks some boats.<br>_________________<br>Homer: Lisa, would you like a donut? <br>Lisa: No thanks.

Superior Epic Focus is a wpn mstr-only feat.<br><br>And no; the build would not suck against it actually. Equipping cleverly, you can push this build over 80ac dualwieding without imp-expert - that's with mostly class-fixed items.  Scrolls are also a key; and to cast with no chance of failure you need about 34 ranks of umd.<br>With a mundane large shield; plus imp expert your ac is around 85 easily; which could very well survive against an ab of 70 (since epic dodge takes the first hit out of the equation; and 50% conceal helps a ton too).  I'll add this; that the examples I gave are probably the extreme; and just an example of what could be thrown at this kind of build with the ac behind it.<br><br>Was kinda why I mentioned possibly adding an epic focus umd; as mostly the best dodge-based ac items are around 50+ umd; and usually classes like fighter or monk only due to bonus applied. Again, mileage might vary; I've based a lot of this on the pw I play on - which can get a little insane with builds at times, but is still not by any means at the high magic item stage.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 05/13/05 16:24</span></i></p>

Yep.  Thats just using an old post example of a straight attacker; the image I've given the link to has a build which gets insane ab.  Take away the weapon enhancement and the +12 str and its still over 80ab...<br><br>But aye; we're wondering into equipment territory here.  My bad.  Not my intention indeed; and certainly I'm awful at the explaining bit.  Where I was trying to head is; a boost of +10 ac at the cost of 10ab or +5ac at the cost of 5ab just means a quick way of boosting your ac... without the hassles.<br><br>FYI: the world I took this from has very few rare items above +7.  Actually; only two or three that I know of and I've seen most of them.  Most weapons are +6 or less; and the midrange to high range are all nondrop and extremely rare.  Items rarely have more than +5 stat increase (and then are very restricted and need high umd to cross-class)

Yeah in that world every bit of AC can be made to count. Its a reasonable balance (STR vs DEX wise IMO)<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!
