Hey guys.. so I left the extremely low-magic environment and have ventured to new worlds. But I need some help.. The server is basically a bunch of Fighter/Bard(or Wiz)/PMs with Dev Crit. They just stand around and wait for their dev to come then laugh because they think they are awesome..<br><br>They must be stopped! <br><br>Okay, so what I'm asking for is a Half-Orc who deals a ton of damage, has great AB, doesn't use Dev, and enough AC so he doesn't get killed by dev every second. <br><br>The NORMAL AB fully buffed with items on my server is around 60 give or take a few.<br><br>There's a subrace for Half-Orc called the ..<br><br>Titan - +7 AC, +8 STR, +8 CON, 15% Immune to Magic Damage, +10 Disc, +10 Taunt, and +2 Regen.<br><br>Items at level 40 -<br><br>Most weapons follow this template: Magic Damage 5, Enhancement +10, Keen, Massive Criticals 2d12, Use Heal 1/day, Vampiric Regen +5<br><br>Most armor: Armor +6, Damage Reduction +10 soak 5, Con +6, STR +6, Haste<br><br>Tower Shield - +7AC, Resist 15/- on Bludgeoning and Slashing<br><br>Helmet - Immunity Death Magic + Knockdown, Regen +2, SR 10, 1/day Finger of Death, Raise Dead, and Wail.<br><br>CLoak - +7AC, Damage Reisst 5 Bludgeon Pierecing Slashing, Immunity Death Magic, +3 Universal Saves, Regen +2<br><br>Gauntlet - DR + 11 soak 5, +6 STR<br><br>Amulet - +8 AC +5 Regen<br><br>Boots - +6 AC +6 Con Haste<br><br>Ring 1 - +6 AC +6 Regen Timestop 2/day<br><br>Ring 2 - Acid Cold Elec Fire 20/-, Freedom, Regen +3, Improved Invis 1/day, Invis 3/day, and True Seeing 3/day<br><br>The only real use of discipline on this server is to avoid being disarmed. Immunity Knockdown, Mind Spells, Death Magic, and Freedom are all readily available.<br><br>SO, to sum everything up. <br><br>Could you guys whip up a Half-Orc with High Damage, High Attack Bonus, Decent AC, and doesn't use Dev. I know I can't have my cake and eat it too. So I understand that you can't have EVERYTHING in a build. But a lot of things are covered by items alone, so..<br><br>Hope I get some help!<br><br>Thanks!<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_sleep2.gif">

If you want to teach Dev Crit spammers who's the man, you shouldn't use a puffed up melee, good AB and damage probably won't beat their already good AB and damage + Dev Crit. If I were to fight those guys, given all those annoying immunities you wrote, I'd use a Sorcerer 37 / Paladin 1 / Blackguard 2 and laugh at them with my superb Fortitude save and how they can't dev crit a mage while spamming IGMS on their faces, but that build requires some alignment shift. Or well, a Pale Master should do the trick as well but it's less funny. I don't recommend to use what you're asking for.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/02/09 22:06</span></i></p>

Well that would be fine but isn't the AC on a caster kind of low? Wouldn't they be eaten up by the constant barrage of melee attacks? Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, on the server runs around with a Scimitar and declares themselves the best because they can dev, and most PvP on the server is based on 4 or 5 people trying to kill one guy to obtain some kind of reward. So my reasoning was that if I could get high enough damage I could just mop them off the field and still look cool with my Titan subrace.. mwahaahaha. But thanks for the reply Thax, I'll think about it.<br><br>P.S. I have no problem whatsoever with Alignment changes. And the subraces add a soft cap to abilities (kind of like bulls strength) so they are included in the +12 limit on stats.<br><br>Thanks! <br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_sleep2.gif">

Well, you could use Epic Warding, they will die pretty fast too you know. If you're hasted you should kill about anyone in 2 rounds of Empowered or Maximized IGMS. Saying mages have low ACs is quite unfair, try Stilled Spell and use an armor and shield, you'll get the same AC a damage dealer gets, now use Improved Expertise and you might stand long enough. The build I described can be easily tweaked to take Divine Shield, a strong one at that.<br><br>You won't get a hard hitting meleer that they can't hit. If you want an AC high enough to fight a Dev Crit make a DEX based Rogue/Bard/Pale Master with Epic Dodge, but a "Great damage" build will never reach the AC you need.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/03/09 02:56</span></i></p>

With epic Warding, Mestils Acid Sheathe, Elemental shield and death armor chances are good to win even if you just sit and watch. Add autostills with full plate and tower shiedl in ImpExpertise mode and they won't hit too much either, while you SPAM IGMS. Actually, if they catch you off guard just send off a Bigby to hold them, then buff vefore the next a-hole surfaces and SPAM IGMS. If you can't beat those guys with a caster, you can't beat them.<br><br>If you reall want though, why not try a Fighter14/Bard16/Palemaster10. Immune to Dev yourself, and <br>your AB/AC/ damage buffed(ultravision+Darkness=Goody good) and singing both curse- and bardson should be superior to most melee builds. If you want to do it without PM, then take RDD for better AB and damage. Not sure how your saves will fare though, maybe it's possible to do Bard20/CoT10/RDD10. For lasting Inspiration and better saves. No Heavy armor inherent though, and no EWS.<br><br><b>*EDIT*</b> Your Titan build. Cleric26/Bard4/PM or RDD 10. Enough Wisdom for lvl 9 spells(H-orcs has no Wis penalty), then pump Strength.
