Yeah, like *that* has never been done before!  Ha.<br><br>Basically wondering is this, I've seen a lot of Monk/Druid/Shifters out there, mostly with more Druid than Monk.<br><br>Was wondering what you all thought of doing a mostly Monk one, like 18 levels with Empty Body, along with say 5 Druid and 17 Shifter.  <br> <br>I assume Empty Body could be used while shifted, since it's an ability and not a spell.  So one could be in a lot of shapes while having Monk Speed and Empty Body to help out.<br><br>It's a higher magic would, so it wouldn't be an Uber-type char.  Still with Monk Speed and the abilty to spam gazes (either confusing or petrifying ones) and running away, it could be a fun one to play...<br><br>Joe

One thing to keep in mind is that Empty Body is 1/day.  The speed is nice on any build, especially hit and run types.<br><br>If you are pumping up your Wisdom, then yes, Monk would be a great choice.<br><br>If you wish to focus your tactics on two forms, then your third class should be focused for them as well.<br><br>Going Kobold?

Empty Body is twice per day Bromium. The duration is regular, only 1 round/level but minimum 18 rounds, it can be used while shifted, granted as a good thing, Empty Body is pretty cool stuff, the thing is you don't get a lot of bonuses from 18 Monk, only +3 AC, unarmed damage gets wasted while shifted, more stunning fists could be useful, Quivering Palm, well, low fortitude enemies die against it so it's not really crap, but that's about it, speed... I don't know, I don't play speed running styles, for a runner the Arcane Archer / Monk spamming Called Shot: Leg is usually the best..<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.
