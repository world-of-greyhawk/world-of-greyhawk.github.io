Hi I'm looking to make a cleric/monk/rogue  +5 items and UMD goes by how many rogue lvls you have so that will not be used.  I was thinking 3 rogue lvls max out search, tumble and unlock.  I was also thinking of using a single kama.  I would like 20 lvls cleric or more.<br><br>Thanks

I would start by checking the builds index on the builds forum. I think I saw a few along that lines there.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Well I would offer a level split as a starting point for your original request. Perhaps a 20 cleric/15 monk/5 rogue, or a 20 cleric/18 monk/2 rogue would do what you are trying. They both all give most monk abilities, as well as plenty of clerical spel power. The second one gives empty body which is a nice concealment ability. You could easily go a high Wis route and get improved ki strike 4 and 5 and stick with unarmed.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

I just posted a build like this in Epic Builds forum.  It only has 15 lvls of Cleric, but it should be very effective both at stealth and at melee.
