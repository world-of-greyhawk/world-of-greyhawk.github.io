Using a tenser this build would have a bonus to attack of +11, a +3 enhancement, but would suffer from a slightly lower strength.  However, epic mage armor can be quite handy  when in one that form.

RIGHT!!  Tensers!  Forgot that little guy!<br><br>RIGHT!! Undispelable!  In my last 2 years of playing i did PRC exclusively.  THe Epic spells in PRC are actually implemented as Lv 10 spells, which were dispellable!  EMA in PRC also added +20 to Armor AC.  SO it was annoying with my lv 40 caster to LOOSE ema and 16 ac (i had +4 armor ac on my bracers)!  <br><br>RIGHT!!  Slots freed up!  Again, i was spoiled GREATLY in that we could build our own gear to suit (within reason).  I ALWAYS had exactly what i wanted and never had to settle.

Yes, in a world where there are no such thing as items, it is "nice" to be able to add 5/5/5/5 AC on your own {+5 deflection bonus, +5 dodge bonus, +5 armor bonus, and +5 natural armor bonus).  One ring of Protectin +6, Full plate +6 and an Amulet of resistance +6, and your precious epic feat is negated.  In other words, if you are playing in a magic environment, you have to ask, IS AN EPIC FEAT worth +5 Dodge ac?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Armor Skin is +2 AC and well worth it.  2 AC = 20-35% less physical hits in all but the most extreme of cases.  Unless the dodge AC is going to waste because of +10 dodge boots, Haste, and Bard Song filling up the cap or something, +5 Dodge AC is very nice.<br><br>And, as Kail said, a major benefit is *not* needing that ring of protection and instead getting other stats.

A pm lvl counts as half a wizard lvl for spells.  So the 10 is actually +5 to caster lvl.  If he has 14wiz + 10 pm is 19 caster lvl.  If he has an epic character, there should be no concerns about the epic spells.

Making a good spellsword is rather difficult and involves a lot of give and take. I started a thread in the general forum recently where I invited people to bring their favorite builds.<br>My hope was that we might learn from the best ones.<br><br>IMO this build is better than your last build. You still sruggle a bit with AB and penetration, but it has improved. <br>Penetrating a SR of 32 is a benchmark since you find standard "epic" items that grant SR 32. You will need a roll of 9 to beat it, meaning you only hit 60% of the time. The spell penetration feats will help some and make your IGMS far more lethal. ESP would in fact make you hit on 90% of your attempts against SR 32.

I read the nwnwiki and i WAS wrong again! I never used PM in prc cuz there exist spells that mimic the imm to crits.  <br><br>WIth this realization of my ineptitude with PM's i wonder if you are giving up too much for imm to crits?  Sure its a nice thing to have, but now, your caster lvl is 23 and your ab is low.  This is why i dont like spellswords.
