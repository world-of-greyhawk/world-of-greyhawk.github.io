The Resolute Missionary<br>Cleric 25, Fighter 10, Harper Scout 5<br>PvM 1-40<br>Human (Male)<br><br>Whose sole aim is to spread the word of his god. And woe betide those who ignore his gospel, for through him his god shall strike down the unbelievers.<br><br>No others currently to compare in Pulse-Cap's Engine. This build certainly augments the fighter's ability through the use of divine spells, whilst benefiting from the Harper Scout abilities (Tumble, Stackable Eagle's Splendour and Cat's Grace, Epic Skill Foci). Base Damage output is reasonable thanks to an unbuffed STR of 24 and WS/ EWS. Through buffs this can reach considerably more, notably through Aura of Vitality, Battle Mastery, Darkfire in particular.<br><br>Weapon Choice in this instance is either a Scimitar (in which case drop Toughness for Improved Critical) or Warhammer (keep Toughness), but up to you really.<br><br>Main aims here were to benefit from the stackable CHA to benefit both domains (War &amp; Trickery) to augment his abilities. Access to both Divine Shield &amp; Might will be handy for an extra edge in those more tricky confrontations. (Duration 2-8 rounds each). <br><br>His Persuade skill ranking is purely to suit the character, in terms of his ability to convert the heathens to his god's will purely by his oratorial skills. His melee abilities are a nice backup to enforce this divine belief.<br><br>STR: 14 (24)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 14 (20)<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 14<br><br>01: Cleric(1): Power Attack, Extend Spell, Domain War, Domain Trickery<br>02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus<br>03: Cleric(2): Divine Might<br>04: Fighter(2): STR+1, Knockdown, (STR=15)<br>05: Fighter(3)<br>06: Cleric(3): Divine Shield<br>07: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization<br>08: Cleric(4): STR+1, (STR=16)<br>09: Cleric(5): Empower Spell<br>10: Cleric(6)<br>11: Cleric(7)<br>12: Cleric(8): STR+1, Toughness, (STR=17)<br>13: Cleric(9)<br>14: Cleric(10)<br>15: Cleric(11): Iron Will<br>16: Cleric(12): WIS+1, (WIS=15)<br>17: Fighter(5)<br>18: Fighter(6): Alertness, Blind Fight<br>19: Fighter(7)<br>20: Fighter(8): WIS+1, Improved Knockdown, (WIS=16)<br>21: Cleric(13): Great Strength I, (STR=18)<br>22: Harper Scout(1): Epic Skill Focus: Discipline<br>23: Cleric(14)<br>24: Cleric(15): WIS+1, Great Strength II, (STR=19), (WIS=17)<br>25: Cleric(16)<br>26: Fighter(9)<br>27: Fighter(10): Epic Weapon Focus, Epic Weapon Specialization<br>28: Harper Scout(2): WIS+1, (WIS=18)<br>29: Cleric(17)<br>30: Cleric(18): Great Strength III, (STR=20)<br>31: Cleric(19)<br>32: Harper Scout(3): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br>33: Cleric(20): Great Strength IV, (STR=21)<br>34: Cleric(21)<br>35: Cleric(22)<br>36: Cleric(23): STR+1, Great Strength V, Great Wisdom I, (STR=23), (WIS=20)<br>37: Harper Scout(4)<br>38: Cleric(24)<br>39: Cleric(25): Epic Prowess<br>40: Harper Scout(5): STR+1, Epic Skill Focus: Persuade, (STR=24)<br><br>Hitpoints: 450<br>Skillpoints: 225<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 26/27/15<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +2<br>BAB: 27<br>AB (max, naked): 38 (melee), 27 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 17/28<br>Spell Casting: Cleric(9)<br><br>Skills: <br>Concentration 42(44)<br>Disable Trap 1(3)<br>Discipline 43(60)<br>Lore 7(14)<br>Open Lock 1(0)<br>Persuade 43(55)<br>Search 4(6)<br>Spellcraft 38(40)<br>Tumble 40(39)<br><br>I've been trying to improved this one and there are two points I would like to improve on:<br>1.

Actually, I would push base AB lower, so that you get the 4th attack from Divine Power. I would move 1 HS level pre-epic, and one cleric level (move 2 fighter levels into Epic). This will bring BAB down to 15, so you get the 4th attack at full AB from DP. <br><br>TM

Doing so would gain you 7th level Cleric spells earlier and improved Fort and will save, but you lose a fighter feat pre-epic, have a lower base AB, and unchanged epic feat selection. You then have a free feat to take for HS, either Favored Enemy or Curse Song, which are of little and no value respectively.<br><br>Would have to give up any one of the following: Blind Fight or Improved Knockdown. Not sure which I would sacrifice, if at all.<br><br>Without taking the Strength Domain I am not usually that comfortable relying on Divine Power, as I frequently prefer to have other spells lined up instead of Extended Divine Power. <br><br>Some thought needed on this if I was to follow your advice. hmm

Well, you are going to pick up an epic fighter feat, so just delay one of the fighter feats to epic (no need to drop one). I would drop ESF: persuade as the epic HS feat to keep the other things.<br><br>To be honest, except for the stackable cat's grace and eagle's splendor (which only really make a difference in low magic settings), you don't gain that much from HS - the bonus feats don't allow you to pump your prime stats (Wis or Str). I might consider going Cleric 26/HS 4/Fighter 10 (dropping ESF: Persuade, you already can cast invisibility from your domain), take just 3 fighter levels pre-epic (quicker spell progression). Then you have lots of fighter feats in Epic, so you could add Armor Skin if you want, or take IKD in epic (it's not critical since you aren't a small race).<br><br>TM
