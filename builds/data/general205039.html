I'm trying to sort out in my head the system for determining what feats are available at epic levels.  Let's say, for example, that I have a fighter/wm.  Each class gets bonus feats, plus the usual feats everyone gets.  As I understand it, when the character gets a base feat (at 21,24,27, etc), he can choose any of the pre-epic feats or any of the basic epic feats (great stat, epic save, etc).  When he gets a bonus fighter feat, he can take an epic feat from the fighter epic feat list, but none of the pre-epic feats or basic epic feats.  Likewise, when he gets a bonus WM feat, he can pick from the WM epic feat list, but he can't access pre-epic feats or basic epic feats.  Is this right?<br><br>Also, what happens if he hits a class bonus feat at the same level as a base feat?  Does he get one from each list, or does he get two from the combined list?  It's a minor difference, but could be very important.<br><br>Thanks!

if you get two feats from two lists (1 general 1 bonus), they are taken as one from each list.

This is what will happen.  The game will start by presenting you with a complete list of all feats you can take, any regular feat and any bonus feat.  If the first feat you choose is one that can only be taken as a regular feat (i.e. something not on your bonus feat list), then after choosing it, all the regular feats will vanish from the selection and you'll be left with only the bonus feats to choose from for the second feat.  Likewise, if you pick one that can only be take as a bonus feat (which is rarer, since most bonus feats you'll have can also be taken as regular feats), then the other "bonus feat only" feats will disappear and you'll be left with only the regular feats you can take.  If you take a feat that could come from either the regular or bonus list, then none of the feats will disappear, and you'll be able to pick from either list for your second feat.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 07/21/05 16:49</span></i></p>

What's odd is that you can't take a basic epic feat (like Great Stat) with a class bonus feat.  It makes sense in some cases (Fighter taking Great Wisdom, perhaps), but it seems logical and reasonable that a fighter could pick up strength, dexterity, or constitution using a fighter bonus feat.  Oh well.

Another question.  Do you have to be level 11+ in a class to take an epic feat from that class's list, given that you are CL21+ and meet all the other prerequisites?  For instance, if I take Fighter level 8 at character level 25, can I get Epic Weapon Specialization?  Thanks.

If a fighter could use his ridiculous number of feats to boost his stats through the roof, that might be a bit much.<br><br>Steve
