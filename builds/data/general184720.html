What do you think is the best possible PvP build ever? what combination is the most deadly versus any other build? can anyone here direct me to where i could get such a character( a step by step character level progress sheet or bic file)?

First of all, the conditions of the server make a tremendous difference, but in general:<br><br>In a one-on-one battle, a sorcerer will almost invariably win. (unless your server has resist magic damage items). You can get more than 15 IGMS: regular, stilled, empowered, maximized.<br>The regular/stilled do an average of 120 damage<br>Empowered do an average of 180<br>Maximized do precisely 240.<br><br>Some people act like a pure monk (with TEN spell resistance feats) is a threat to a mage, but honestly, what can a pure monk do? With an extended mestil's acid sheath thrown on, that pure monk won't be able to hurt the sorcerer without killing himself first.<br>In theory, if this really bothered you, that perhaps a monk might actually wait for you to run out of mestil's (which would take quite a while, since you can recast it many times), you could simply make a sorcerer with no ranks in tumble at all and low ac, and run past monks repeatedly to make them take mestil's damage. If you're going to do a sorcerer like that, you'll definitely want to be a Pale Master.<br>My personal favorite is 29 sorc 10 pm 1 pali, with epic spell penetration.<br><br>Your only real threat as a mage (one on one, at least), is a better mage.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

Generally speaking, I agree that Sorcs the kings of PvP, but they CAN be defeated by a good Rakshasa Shifter build, as Rakshasas are <i>immune</i> to spells of 8th lvl and lower. <br><br> Shifters are also good against Dev. Critters and Rogue/WM types, as they can shift into forms that are immune to sneaks, criticals, etc., and get other abilities as well, such as dragon breath.<br><br> That said, Shifters are only really good on low-magic worlds, although that's not to say it isn't possible to be effective on a high-magic world, but you definitely have to get a little more creative.

As far as I can tell I would think a pure monk with elemental resistance and Improved SR would be able to knock a Sorcerer without taking much damage.<br><br>*goes to test such a build*

Well, good luck getting enough improved SR AND enough elemental resistance to make a difference. Reciprocal damage from mestil's on a near-pure sorc: 70ish. From elemental shield: 35ish.<br>You simply don't get enough epic feats.<br>Plus your AB would be absolutely horrendous.<br><br>Rakshaka's a good point though. Like the monk, the best recourse might be to try to AOO you, but that might be hard since it'll be casting. Other than that you could try weird, and the level 9 bigby, if it lands, will at least get you away.<br>But every build has its corresponding rock, paper, and scissors, even the mage. All around, though, the mage has a marked advantage over almost every build out there.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

I guess you would know -&gt; <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_builds.html" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br>I think there is a Rashaka (shifter) build somewhere in the builds section.

I think that Druid 28/ Shifter 11 (rak form and possibly undead as well)/ monk 1 (for wisdom AC and tumble etc...)would be a serious challenge in PVP for almost every other build.  If the server supports improved item merging, so properties like death magic, knockdown, paralysis and mind spell immunity can be carried over to the shifted state then its almost a foregone conclusion.
