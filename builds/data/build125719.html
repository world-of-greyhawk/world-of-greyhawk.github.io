The Ravaging Conquerer (sounds better than bull's eye I think; I need a real good name for him though -_-;)<br><br>FIXED version!<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Alignment: Neutral Evil<br><br>Statistics:<br>STR 17<br>DEX 13<br>CON 14<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8<br><br>Rogue 5 / Fighter 7 / Weapon Master 28<br><br>Equipment: Full Plate, Scimitar &amp; Tower Shield<br><br>Leveling: Rogue 2, Fighter 4, Weapon Master 7, Fighter 2, Rogue 1, Weapon Master 2, Rogue 1, Weapon Master 13, Fighter 1, Weapon Master 6, Rogue 1. (Note: I changed the leveling order a bit to be more power gamish; to be optimum the whole level scheme)<br><br>Skills: Intimidate: 4 ranks, Tumble: 40 ranks, Discipline: 42 ranks, Spot or Listen: 43 ranks, Use Magic Device: 26 ranks (if you feel hide/ms aren't worth the loss in UMD, sac one of the hides and increase UMD), Hide 37 Ranks, Move Silently 36 ranks<br><br>Rogue 1 - Dodge, Expertise<br>Rogue 2 / Fighter 1 - Weapon Focus: Scimitar, Mobility<br>Rogue 2 / Fighter 2 - Knockdown, **Raise All STR**.<br>Rogue 2 / Fighter 4 - Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack<br>Weapon Master 3 - Improved Critical: Scimitar<br>Weapon Master 6 - Improved Knockdown<br>Rogue 3 / Fighter 5 / Weapon Master 7 - Power Attack<br>Rogue 3 / Fighter 6 / Weapon Master 7 - Weapon Specialization: Scimitar<br>Rogue 4 / Fighter 6 / Weapon Master 8 - Cleave<br>Weapon Master 10 - Nothing. STR is 21.<br>----<br>Epic<br><br>Weapon Master 11 - Great Cleave<br>Weapon Master 13 - Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>Weapon Master 14 - Great Strength I<br>Weapon Master 16 - Overwhelming Critical: Scimitar<br>Weapon Master 17 - Great Strength II<br>Weapon Master 19 - Devastating Critical: Scimitar<br>Weapon Master 20 - Great Strength III<br>Weapon Master 22 - Epic Prowess<br>Fighter 7 - Epic Weapon Specialization: Scimitar<br>Weapon Master 25 - Epic Toughness I, Great Strength IV<br>Weapon Master 28 - Armor Skin, Great Strength V<br>Rogue 5* End Strength: 32<br><br>You are a freakin' BEAST.<br><br>Your end BAB is 29, which is 1 less than a normal fighter/wm. But you get +1 from superior weapon focus at 5, and at 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, and 28. That's +7 from that. You also have epic prowess. Another +1. You also have Epic Weapon Focus; add a +3. That adds up to +11. Now, you also took 5 great strength feats and have a +11 STR modifier. That is a massive +22 to your AB WITHOUT ANY BUFFS AT ALL. So under ALL circumstances, without ANY magic, your AB is: +51/+46/+41/+36... But wait, it doesn't stop there! With Improved Knockdown, you can even pass Arcane Archers against small and tiny creatures! Against small creatures, using IKD, your AB is +55/+50/+45/+40; against tiny creatures, using IKD, your AB is +59/+54/+49/+44!!! You also have an awesome crit range of 13-20 x3 mult - with a GENERIC scimitar, and can make it 10-20 crit with keen; and since you have so much strength, the damage you deal is obscene. You also have a +3d6 sneak attack, and full Tumble AC.<br><br>You don't have half-bad HP, either. Maxed out, you have 492 HP. Considering most enemies won't even survive two rounds with you, that's very high.<br><br>~ Lock.<br>_________________<br>"Life builds you up just to tear you down." - 3rd Strike
