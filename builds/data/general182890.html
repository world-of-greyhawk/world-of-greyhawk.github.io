I just built a Monk 27 / Sorc 2 / RDD 11 character and he's great defensively (immune to fire, paralysis, sleep, mind-affecting spells, disease, poison, 50% concealment, etc), but his offensive skills suck.<br><br>I took advantage of the NWN house rule that either:<br>1) a critical hit = an automatic hit<br>2) a natural 20 = an automatic hit<br><br>Under these rules:<br>[threat] [chance to crit]<br>20-20 -&gt; 00.25%<br>19-20 -&gt; 01.00%<br>18-20 -&gt; 02.25%<br>17-20 -&gt; 04.00%<br>16-20 -&gt; 06.25%<br>15-20 -&gt; 09.00%<br>14-20 -&gt; 12.25%<br>13-20 -&gt; 16.00%<br>12-20 -&gt; 20.25%<br>11-20 -&gt; 25.00%<br><br>If 2 is true and not 1, then you can assume that .25% of all your hits will automatically critical hit, no matter what.  Otherwise, you can use this table to determine how many of your character's attacks will statistically critical hit.<br><br>For instance, the Kukri Master:<br>6 attacks/round, 13-20 range = .16 * 6 = .96 critical hits per round, or a 96% chance he'll make a critical hit in any given round, assuming he always hits.

2 things :<br><br>1°) If you roll on your threat range, but you don't beat the opponent's AC, you don't hit at all, Unless it's a natural 20.<br><br>2°) The threat roll needs to beat the enemy's AC a second time, it doesn't need to be in the threat range like the first roll.<br><br>Given these 2 points, you can't calculate any stats without the enemy's AC.<br>_________________<br>If you call IGMS, Harm, Mestil's acid shield, the Bigby hands or Devastating Critical balanced in your post, don't expect me to like you.<br><br>I'm sorry about my bad english, I'm french.<br>In every lie lies a part of truth.
