<i>Hacks a broad and easily trodden path to 40th street. Both for PvM and melee PvP.</i><br><br>__________<br><br>The caravan leader Gunnar entered the shabby  tavern, somewhat disillusioned. He was about to lead his trade caravan out of the city, but he had a big problem. His second in command had bought so much goods he had no money to hire escorts, and without escorts his goods would be robbed for sure. He sat down at the bar and ordered an ale. "A fortune in goods" he murmured to himself over his ale. "And either stuck heer wi' it or lose everythin' fer sure"<br><br>No, the situation looked grim indeed. He sat there awhile, pondering. Should he risk it? No, it was certain doom. He would have no choice. He had to sell some of his goods here, at a loss, to raise enough funds for some guards. Darn, he thought, Ahm gonna kick that idiots arse so hard he won't be able to sit in weeks.<br> "What's troubling you, old friend?" the bartender approached him. They were old friends, and went way back. "Oh, it's that idiot, Carn." he replied "he 'as bought so much goods, I cannae afford guards"<br><br>"Ah, that's the reason for your sour face. Never was to bright a lad, that Carn." The bartender stated. <br>Gunnar nodded, cursing himself for giving that young idiot so much responsibility.<br>"You have food enough to feed 3 extra men, and I'll give you the manpower of a small army."<br>"Aye, I've enough food, but no coin! Ye ain't gettin' any army fer food!" Gunnar almost yelled.<br>"There are frequent attacks?" the bartender continued, not paying attention to the outburst.<br>"Ah'll teel ya. Those darn bandits attacks evr'thin' that could look like a small earnin'!"<br>The bartender nodded towards the corner, and Gunnar turned around. In the Corner sat a big man, his muscles rippling under skin. He was scarred from countless battles, and was uglier than sin. At each hip hang a weapon, a hammer on one and an axe on the other. Both were polished, and looked like perfect examples, standing out from the otherwise filthy, ragged man. The man glanced back at Gunnar, a mild smile on his face. His eyes were kind under the scarred face, but they had a hint of danger.<br><br>Gunnar shook his head,"even if one man were enough, I can't pay even him"<br>"No one knows his name." the bartender kept going "They call him the Asgardian. Rumors has it he is Trollborn as some Asgardians are, hence his great strength. If you promise him fighting versus bandits, he will join you for nothing but food. He eats for three, but is the best and strongest swordsman i have ever seen. He fights for ten men, I promise."<br>Gunnar looked back at the Asgardian. The huge man grinned, pointed to his belly, then to his empty mead-glass and waved Gunnar over.<br>Gunnar sighed, ordered the Asgardian a meal, a glass of mead and went towards his table. Hope had returned to his eyes.<br>________<br><br>This is the story, its based on old Norse mythology, were trolls were quite different from D&amp;D. Trollborn humans were said to possess great strength and intelligence. Now over to what this Trollborn Asgardian can do. I just made him with the highest possible unbuffed AB. His damage will not be as good as a RDD char, but he doesn't get those wings everyone has, and his AB is better. <br><br>Half-Orc, CG.(All none evil goes, but this suits the story best)<br><br>STR 19(36)<br>DEX 13<br>CON10<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 6<br><br>All ability increases goes to STR<br><br>1:Fghtr: WF:battleaxe; Dodge<br>2:fghtr: Mobility<br>3:fghtr: Expertise<br>4:fghtr: WS:battleaxe<br>5:fghtr:<br>6:fghtr6:Spring attack; WW attack<br>7:WM: WoC: battleaxe<br>8:WM:<br>9WM: ImpCrit: battleaxe<br>10:WM:<br>11:WM:<br>12:WM: Knockdown<br>13:WM7:<br>14:CoT:<br>15:CoT: Toughness*;IKD*<br>16:CoT:<br>17:CoT4: WF:warhammer<br>18:WM: IronWill*<br>19:WM:<br>20:WM:<br>21:WM: GrSTR I(25)<br>22:WM:<br>23:WM13: EWF:battleaxe<br>24:CoT: GrSTR II(27)<br>25:CoT6: EWS: battleaxe<br>26:WM:<br>27:WM: GrSTR III(28)<br>28:WM: WoC:warhammer<br>29:WM:<br>30:WM: GrSTR IV(30)<br>31:WM: EWF: warhammer<br>32:WM:<br>33:WM: GrSTR V(32)<br>34:WM: Armor skin<br>35:WM:<br>36:WM: GrSTR VI(34)<br>37:WM: Epic Prowess<br>38:WM:<br>39:WM: GrSTR VII(35)<br>40:WM: Epic Toughness I.

You ain't getting better AB unbuffed with melee. His saves are medium +. except Will which is bad, at least early on. The CoT levels help a lot. You might, if you accept the loss of two strength, abandon CoT for fighter instead, take fighter 11 in an epic feat lvl to get EWS. You can use that excess GrSTR feat for anything you want, perhaps impCrit:hammer. Or start with 18 str, and raising CON by 2 and DEX by 1. Take bard or rogue as the last level. Both max tumble, bard maxes spellcraft to help saves, and Rogue gives you UMD. Losing CoT will affect your saves negatively, and that 1 level smells cheese in the whole neighborhood. There is another advantage to rogue. You get sneak attack. That is excellent if going against superdexer's. When you sneak attack their DEX and dodge bonuses doesn't count, so you will get their formidable AC's down to size.<br><br>Another thing, in the same manner my evil twin  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">     doesn't build with monks, I don't build with Dev crit. Not ever. If you want it, figure it out yourself.<br>Maxing your strength and getting +5 weapons is possible in most settings. Your AB will then be 65. Getting UMD and true strike scrolls can take it as high as 80.<br><br>For your survival, get save boosters or immune to mind affecting (Clarity potions etc.). AC raising will do you good to, since that is not very high, but you'll most likely carve up anything before it carves you up. Which of the slasing and blunt weapon you want to do the most damage with is open, really, take your pick.<br><br>Let me know what you think.

Perhaps no invention here, but it gets lots of points for class and style.  How can one knock a half-orc with a 14 Int?  <br><br>The tale definitely adds the right spice.

Hmmm, a nice build. Would it not benefit this to take a FTR level post-epic to get epic weapon specialization?
