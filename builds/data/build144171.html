Nice build, ya get casting, good buffs, dmg, decent ab and heals.<br><br>I would however pick elf as a race, half elf is bugged in that it will choose AA as prefered class and you will recieve a xp penalty.  If you go elf and 1 lvl of wiz you won't have any penalty and all you lose is true strike.  You also don't have to invest in martial weapons.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By evo_dragon on 07/28/04 05:00</span></i></p>

What about putting thos points you had in CHa into STR and get a consistant damage output instead of the temporary bonus from divine might? Don't get me wrong, I love might as it bypasses damage reduction. Just tossing out options for you.

yes i think this is one of the best archer builds i have tried.  i messed around with something very similar to it a few weeks ago.  the server i play on, not many clerics use the 9th lvl spells.  if thats something you want to forego, you could put some extra lvls into AA, to get the ab higher.<br><br>i also tried this with druid as well as cleric, but i think cleric is the choice to go with.  also i liked the air or magic domiain for the attack spells.  the server i play on, once you get past lvl 18 or so, stone skin does pretty much nothing for ya.

Thanks for the kudos.  I'm playing this char right now, and finding it a little fragile at the beginning (only 5th level), but I'm not really buffing that much either.<br><br>STR v. CHR: Sure, you could bump STR more.  But you've got Divine Power, which raises your STR to 18.  I guess if you need more strength for longer than the spell allows, and have a bow that has enough Mighty to make it worth it, sure.  It also seems a great many Cleric powers are CHR based, so bumping it as high as possible makes a certain amount of sense.<br><br>Less Cleric levels: Frankly, I don't find 9th level spells to be that necessary either.  But having that level of cleric makes them available, and increases the number of other spells you get.  If I were to drop any levels, I'd drop 4 cleric levels for 4 more AA levels.  <br><br>I also have found that instead of taking one of the Epic Toughness feats, Epic Reflexes is also a viable option.  In addition, dropping STR by one and raising INT by one would make True Strike available once per day.  Perhaps not worth it.<br>_________________<br>-------------------------------<br>"What do you fear most in the world?"<br>"The possibility that love is not enough."<br>-- Major Garland Briggs, Twin Peaks

For me, I think I will end up going Wizard 1/Cleric 13/AA 26.  My War domain power will weaken and I'll only be able to cast 7th level spells, but that's fine.  Most of the good buffs are either Maximizable before 7th or Extendable before 7th.  And with the extra 4 AA levels, the damage will increase by 2 (which is one more than the War power gives with the current configuration), as well as giving an additional epic feat (probably Epic Toughness or Prowess).  For those who want more powerful casting, the Wiz1/Cleric17/AA22 build can still be considered extremely viable.

Tyr is correct, you cannot gain more than a +20 magical bonus to ab.  Your character sheet will say otherwise, but if you examine the to hit roll you'll notice a far different number for ab.  After your bab, stat modifier, AA bonus you can only get +20, though I don't know if the halfling +1ab stacks.

Battletide adds a "circumstance" bonus.  True Strike adds a bonus "through magical intuition".  Assuming these are all implemented in unique ways, I don't see why they couldn't stack.  With Divine Favor, the "caster gains a bonus" to AB.  My AB went up, but with a magic weapon, that bonus might be negated.  Same with the War Domain power.  Then again, with more levels of cleric, his AB went up to +84 -- and both of these bonuses are based on cleric levels.  Perhaps bonuses based on level stack differently from other bonuses, and domain power-granted bonuses stack differently from bonuses granted by spells?<br><br>And with a magical bow, I did see an AB in the 90's (+92, I think) with the first iteration of the character.

Since WM works in the same way I would have to assume it isn't a bug of any kind.  Also I believe nature sense's +2 bonus will stack with whatever ab you have.  This is why it's kinda pointless(but fun) to have over 110 ac no matter what.<br><br>Sorry kreestopearq, but regardless of what the description says it is, in the engine it's only 1 thing Magical.  Personally I find it incrediably sloppy that it shows up in the character sheet at all, since they obviously got the formula right when rolling for the actual hit.  Take your char and attack anything and see what ab gets added to the d20 to hit.

Yup evo and Tyr are correct in that you can only have a +20 magic AB bonus. It's just another of those buggy little NWN quirks. Be thankful that it's +20 and not +12 like everything else. It was coded to +20 for true strike to work properly.

In any event, I tested it out.<br><br>Took my shots with a mundane longbow, showing an AB of +82.  Four shots, the numbers added to the die roll were 70, 65, 58, and 53.  True Strike had worn off by the third shot.  I am still pretty happy with the results.<br><br>Oh, the lies!!!  How the game lies to me!!!

One shouldn't throw stones in glass houses Tyr. Actually every single printed manual does not state the INT prereq for improved knockdown. Also the build I had used it in were weapon master builds which had the 13 INT for that class, so the INT prereq never really was paid attention to by myself. What's your excuse for not knowing the BAB prereq for improved critical or to take the dwarven defender class, or many of the other feats you seem to have a habit of taking before you are eligable?
