ok, i know this build is just for kicks but ive tried a few idea and to no avail im not getting the results now i cant use assassin or Shadow dancer, so i was thinking ranger/monk/wm, and this build is leaning more for pvp but can be used for pvm so i can lvl up then pvp.

Weapon Master is for melee weapons only.  You cannot be a sling weapon master.<br><br>I'd lean more rogue/fighter type, or a cleric slinger with zen archery.  Slings don't get a lot of damage so either sneaks or cleric buffs will help with that.  There was another recent post on a halfling slinger that had some useful info and I believe at least a reference if not a link to a cleric slinger (by Avado IIRC)<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 09/25/05 19:08</span></i></p>

A good thing about rogue slingers is that it helps with the undead. You might want to consider some fighter lvls to get shield, wpn specialization, higher attack, etc. It also works quite well with death attack. You may not be aware of it but rapid shot works with slings. That combined with haste will get more shots off.<br>_________________<br>Entropy is a joule thief
