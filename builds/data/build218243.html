In doing so, I read about Gungnir, Odin's spear.  This made me toy around with the idea of a sect of warriors that fought on behalf of Odin, using the spear as a symbol of their allegiance.<br><br>It felt wrong to create a Norse warrior out of Paladin, and I rebuilt it using Barbarian. But as I thought about a warrior that was utterly devoted to his diety, it made me go back to Paladin. I suppose that one could easily swap out Paladin for Barbarian if one wanted. You would lose some buffs, but you would gain a small bit of DR and Greater Rage.  You could also drop a couple of Great Strengths for a Terrifying Rage and something else, if you wanted.<br><br>The ShadowDancer class was thrown in mainly to boost the AC (via Tumble) to offset the lack of a sheild.  It also worked out nicely with some synergy between Evasion and the WeaponMaster's Reflex saving throws.  And it fits a little RP-wise, as Loki was allegedly the one who gave the spear to Odin (rogue probably would work better than ShadowDancer, but alignment restrictions nixed that idea).<br><br>I hated to give up the Charisma and it's bonuses, but with the WeaponMaster pre-req's, I would have had to water down the Strength and lose the Dexterity (leave it at <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif">   . And since I was going to be tight in the AC Department anyway, I didn't want to scrimp on the extra 2 AC from the Dex.<br><br>Anyway, it seemed to work pretty well in the leveler, but it is more of a RP build due to some weaknesses in it's saves and AC.<br><br>Feel free to tweak away....<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 10/30/05 17:48</span></i></p>

Actually, I think Odin's spear is called Grungnir. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Welcome to Norse heroes guild. You will not be using HipS, right, so go rogue.<br>Nice powerful build, able to pierce any opponent, just like Odins spear. Get a holy avenger spear, eh?<br>Kudos.

interesting build.  the synergy is interesting, although for powerfaming of course other choices can be made (rogue in stead of SD mayhaps?).  they can be of any alignment, IIRC.  solid.  with the pally buffs i think you can boost your cha a little bit, so that you boost saves.  probably not by much, but a little bit goes a long way sometimes.<br>a story for this would make this amazing.  as it stands, very nicely done.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"You cannot pass!"

Also, I'd go for the extra HP...after all it costs you only +1 DAM (if you move rogue/SD in epic). Sure taking your first rogue lvl in epic will delay the AC boost, but you'll have anyhow a solid meleer till that point so I don't think it will really "hurt" you. If you want to keep a rogue lvl pre-epic that means -1 AB forever instead of -3AC for only the 8 last pre-epic lvls(since you plan Rogue on 12th lvl). I'd go for rogue lvls only in epic therefore, but that's me.<br><br>Edit: <br>PS: it wouldn't be a bad idea to max out Taunt so you might consider delaying till 40th lvl your last Pally lvl<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/28/05 19:08</span></i></p>
