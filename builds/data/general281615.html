Try Noctar's Noble Realm.  It's friendly to new people, not PvP centered and leveling is ok.

I'd head out to nwnvault and see which modules have a high rating.  There are some nice ones out there.<br><br>Plenty of user feedback to read too.

I think its time for you to break out!  Enter the pw worlds!! ITs time to meet new peeps, to see new things, to experience nwn like it was meant to be experienced!  Otherwise, whats the point!<br><br>Seriously though, having brought a few characters to lv 40 on pws, I cant imagine a story that you could do to realistically bring a single character to lv 40.  From level 30 to 40, it can be a grind and I am not sure that a self respecting designer could give you the 1000 xp per kill for 10 levels to get you there (nor would any self respecting player play for 1000 per kill..)<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

I agree with avado on this one.<br><br>Multiplay is so much more fun and challenging that solo is. It opens much larger opportnities for building as you don't have to fill all the party slots yourself (the damage, tank, healing, support).<br><br>I started my first multiplay on Noctar's, its low-lagg due to a great hosting and lots of nice people, and it has a good crafting system (dont' mind asking people for  help about it before starting) and its very player friendly.<br><br>Oh, and it doesent use CEP that many other PWs out there do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cerolill on 08/25/07 09:53</span></i></p>
