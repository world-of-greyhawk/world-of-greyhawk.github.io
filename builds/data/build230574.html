Well as far as I'm aware this is an original build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">      ..and a quick search reveals 12 other builds with the same base classes...11 of them have at least 20 Cleric levels with the other focussing more on monk than anything else...<br><br>I have several different versions of this build (all with the same class distribution) ...Dex based, Strength based...but overall I think this is probably the most balanced...<br><br>So without any further ado I introduce:<br><br><b>The Well Disciplined Champion</b> - <i>Cleric 15, champion of Torm 18, Monk 7</i><br><b>Fully Playable 1-40 PvA</b><br><br><b>RACE :</b> Human or Elf<br><br>(detailed below it the Human version as it is generally more powerful.

Nicely done<br><br>No ranks in Concentration though? What happens if you are dispelled in battle?<br><br>Is Skill Focus: Discipline really that necessary? another 3 points into Discipline seems a bit of a waste of a feat when your Discipline is already so high unbuffed. <br><br>Monk 7? no real benefit here, unless you were to continue to 9 monk levels for Impr Evasion, otherwise I'd drop 1 monk level in place of a further Cleric level to give you more spells.

I would dump Divine Might and Divine Shield. With a Cha of 13, you adding 1 to damage and AC for 1 round, or 7 for 7 rounds with +12 to Cha. Not enough to be worth two feats. I would deifnitely take Empower Spell in place of one of them, for the buffs if nothing else.<br><br>For the weapon, why not use a kama? You took a monk level at level 1, so you qualify for it early enough. It would gain you more attacks and better AB progression.<br><br>Since you are str-based, I would drop ESF: Discipline. It will be high enough without it - 54 unbuffed, up to 60 with buffed Str, a few more with buffs that affect skills or items that boost discipline. <br><br>Last, you might want to consider dropping 4 levels of CoT for Cleric. Costs you 1 feat (but you have a few to spare if you drop the ones I suggest above), and spend a few on Great Wis to get it to 19. Some of those high level spells are quite useful.<br><br>TM

Not quite so, kama improved AB only works if you're using Monk armor (or none, methinks wizard armor works too, lol) and no shield, the bonus AC works the same, and with that WIS there's nothing much to say anyway, it's just not worth it. Mace deals the same as kama, why not a longsword? or if you do get off divine might and shield, bastard sword with the exotic proficiency.<br><br>Well, even if you're STR based I think your stats can be really improved, your CON and CHA are so low, get STR down to 15, you will only end losing 1 AB and damage, but you get 5 points to raise CHA and CON to 14.<br><br>Divine Might and Shield can still be of use considering the +12 cap, items enter into mind, although you already said so, but +7 can be good, it's depending of how you like it, it's not utter crap. If he goes only melee it's fine I guess..... I would go without them.........<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/15/06 22:37</span></i></p>

<b>I...Samphus</b><br><br>Would have liked to have some ranks in concentration, however in trying to squeeze as much out of the build as possible had to settle for Int 10 --&gt; not too many skill points to play with<br><br>NO, <b>Skill Focus: discipline</b> is not that necessary, however it IS in keeping with the name of the build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  Could easily be substituted for any other feat!<br><br>I kind of already explained about the monk 7...as it can't cast lvl 7 Cleric spells there is no need to make Cleric 16...as far as I am aware you don't gain any bonus spells 1-6 from Cleric 16 so only benefits would be an extra caster level...or 1 round duration for short term buffs!<br><br><b>FinneousPJ</b><br><br>I thought my AB calculations were correct! I made a test build and fromt the log I was getting an AB of 73 when in Divine Wrath...with War Domain powers, the character sheet was saying an AB of 77, however the log was still showing 73!<br><br><b>Tattoed Monk</b><br><br>I made several different versions of this build, a couple without Divine Might &amp; Shield...though the overall build was more skillfull and had more HP I found that it did not generally fare as well in wide ranging situations (different PvP &amp; PvM situations)...<br><br>Though dropping Divine Might &amp; Shield would free up some feats, these would be PRE-Epic so would not be able to be taken as Great Wisdoms!<br><br><b>Thaxll'ssyllia </b><br><br>I would have liked ot use a longsword as the orignal 'Elfie' version gets the weapon proficiency free, however the other constraints that come from Elf are just too crippling. Maybe by dropping <b>Skill Focus: Discipline</b> you could take <b>Weapon Proficiency: Exotic</b> - no point taking martial! - and use a Katana or Bastard sword <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  though if you can get yourself a hand on a <i>Keen</i> Dwarvern Waraxe you'll outperform on average damage <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> <br><br>-------<br><br>Generally the spells are aimed at buffing only, especially towards increasing attack &amp; damage so the higher level Cleric spells seem less useful especially as you need to raise Wisdom by 3 points beyond the final value I have for the build! This would result in more loss of AB and I'm still not really happy with it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>When I was on my way to work this morning I though OMG why didn't I use Kama...would get the 6 attacks!!! Glad to hear that it may not work like that in Heavy Armor!<br><br>Still wondering about whether to keep Divine Might &amp; Shield, however the Dexterity based version doesn't have either...unfortuanatly it also lacks Uncanny Dodge so is meat to anything that can Sneak past it's Spot skill!!!<br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!

A lil bit less str and a lil bit more cha will be worth alot if you got the divine feats, the dmg will probaly be the same, and the ac will be able to get higher with the divine shield + the dmg will be almost unresistable by most foes.<br><br>A better weapon would probaly make it a better build but mace is kinda cool, altho i would have chosed morningstar myself. And as someone said b4, one less monk lvl and one more cleric lvl (and maybe the 4 less CoT, 4 more cleric) would improve it alot. Afterall, you are looking for long duration buffs that boosts your melee skills in combat and those other cleric spells arent too bad either. I understand why u chosed to take the skill focus in discipline, but that is as u said, modifiable and i would have gone for either weapon prof exotic or a metamagic feat instead of the skill focus.<br><br>Overall, a nice build, but it needs some modifications <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

Since the monk level gives you nothing, even though you mainly buff, cleric is useful while monk not, bluffs last a bit longer, and I think most of the attack spells get stronger at an even level..... spells get stronger with caster level, it is better than Monk.

You might want to reconsider using monk robes and kamas. In heavy armor, you lose the monk AC and Wis AC bonus (+1 from monk, +3 from base wis, +1 to +6 depending on Wis buffs, for a total of +4 to +10 depending on Wis buffs). Heavy armor gets you +8 compared to robes, so if you can get a total of +8 to Wis you match it, +10 or +12 beats it. You can get +7 from a simple empowered Owl's Wisdom, so you would minimally need only +1 from items to match heavy armor AC, and +5 or more from items will guarantee that an empowered Owl's will match or beat heavy armor AC. And the kamas will give you 2 more attacks per round (3 with Flurry). <br><br>TM

Think of using kama like getting free super-ITWF. With WF/EWF on kama, you can still wear armor and shield and have the same AB and attack progression as with a mace (4 attacker per round, -5 progression). If you want to do more damage, put on a monk robe and take off the shield, now you get 6 attacks at -3 progression, or 7 attacks with flurry at -2 AB to all (but 2 at max bonus). If it's worth losing the shield for ITWF (6 attacks at -2 AB and -5 progression), it's even more worth it for the kama. You have the flexibility to go either way with a simple hotkey to the shield.<br><br>TM

Heh, I forgot that the buffs would make his DEX and WIS a neat improvement that can't be got with a heavy armor, a high magical shield will gve more bonus I think, but you would lose many AB, so take the kama is worth it. I still think you need HP, but what I said before about setting STR to 15 for CON and CHA to 14 forgets INT... it also works for a CON 14 INT 12 and CHA 12, or lowering WIS 1 point for the INT to get to 12, either way it's your choice, but 396 HP for a melee is just low.<br><br>The skill focus feat is a must change, and there are lots of choices, you could just move great cleave, improved critical and blind-fight into pre-epics to take the remaining feat in, dunno, maybe more great STR or Great WIS.....<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/18/06 02:30</span></i></p>

Please forgive me but I didnt see any mention of why you are taking Cleric to 15th level with only a 16 Wisdom.<br><br>I do agree with those that say robes are more effective than armor for this particular build.
