Pretty trivial indeed.  These things are pretty simple to build, especially if you don't have to worry about leveling.  Take all fighter pre-epic, then a bard level @22, then your 10 RDD levels, then fighter until you cap it w/ a bard level at the end.  Max STR, get all the GRT STR you can, and that's about it.

Now, IF, by some strange twist, you used PRC, then ALL this would go out the window!  If i go back in my mind some 2 or 3 years, i seem to remember a nice little 65 DC Half-orc Bard/RDD/ Brawler.  Oh, the Brawler class and giving Great str as a bonus feat (which is the ONLY way i have yet figured out to get Great Strength 10).  <br><br>The BEST you can hope for, like mentioned above, is 20 str from Half-orc + 10 stats + 7 Gr str (feats taken on 21, 24, 27 etc) +10 RDD = 47 str.  IF you get +12 to str, that adds +6 to ab, dam, and DC.  <br><br>The thing is, there is NO perfect character (outside PRC, where ALL rules are off).  50 is VEY livable.  I have LOVED a character with 26 str and dev crit!<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted <b>06/23/04</b> 21:16 (GMT) -- Anuis<br><br>Suolucider, Blitz 04, <b>avado</b>, Quisition, Boourns, ... welcome to the guild!
