The intention of this character was to race to the dual-scimitars of death (i.e. imp.2wf + maximum critical threat + devastating critical), while actually being a strong all-around character in the low and medium levels. The goal is achieved at level 25. The two main weaknesses of this character are the low HP (for a fighter) and the Will save, but IMO it's a fair trade.<br><br>Skills maxed on rogue levels are Tumble, Traps, Locks &amp; Search. Skills maxed on Fighter/WM levels are Discipline, Heal and Lore to level 9, then just Discipline afterward.<br><br>All ability upgrades go to Strength.<br><br>This character can use whatever weapons s/he likes until specialization at level 12.<br><br>Race: Human<br>Class: Fighter/Rogue/Weapon Master<br>ST 17<br>DX 15<br>CO 10<br>WI 10<br>IN 13<br>CH 8<br><br>Level Class Notes<br>1 R Power Attack, Cleave (incl. 4 ranks in Intimidate)<br>2 F Expertise<br>3 F Dodge, Mobility<br>4 R<br>5 F<br>6 F Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack<br>7 R<br>8 F<br>9 F Ambidexterity, Two-Weapon Fighting<br>10 F<br>11 F Imp.
