In another thread, Georgel wrote "For Dex bards here's what I usually play: Half Elf or Elf (if you don’t mind the xp penalty) Bard 21/Rogue 10/Arcane Archer 9. It's an excellent combination, gives you 4 attacks per round (6 with haste and rapid shot), full arsenal of spells, Sneak Attacks, Evasion, Uncanny Dodge, +5 Arrows to cut through any non-epic damage shields, Fireball Arrows, an extra Rogue Feat (Improved Evasion, or another as desired), maxed out Rogue Skills, Tumble, Use Items, SpellMastery, and a maxed out Bardsong and Curse Song that will quickly turn the tide of any battle. Best of all, you can do almost EVERYTHING in the game and it's extremely fun to play."<br><br>This idea intrigues me. Could some of you draft up a level by level build for this character? I'd really appreciate input from the master builders here. I've asked Georgel to post his build in the Epic Builds thread, but it hasn't shown up yet. So I'm turning to the general public here <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban

This is a slight variation of what you asked for.  The reason I went with 13 Rogue lvls rather than 10 is that you need 2 Rogue feats to get Epic Dodge.  You don't lose much in terms of Bard Song, and you only lose a couple 6th lvl spell slots, so overall I think it's a pretty good trade-off.<br><br><br>Rogue 13/Bard 18/AA 9<br>(pre-epic Rogue 4/Bard 8/AA <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"> <br><br>Race: Half-Elven<br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting: <br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 16<br>Con 14<br>Int 14<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 14<br><br>2 points into Cha, 8 points into Dex<br><br>Ending:<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 26<br>Con 14<br>Int 14<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 16<br><br><br>Feats<br><br>1 Point Blank Shot<br>3 Rapid Shot<br>6 Dodge<br>9 WF: Shortbow<br>12 Toughness<br>15 Called Shot<br>18 Curse Song<br>21 Epic Weapon Focus: Shortbow<br>24 Epic Prowess   <br>27 Armor Skin, Rogue: Improved Evasion<br>30 Lasting Inspiration<br>33 Great Dex I<br>36 Great Dex II<br>39 Epic Dodge, Rogue: Defensive Roll<br><br><br>Epic level progression<br><br>21    AA<br>22-27 Rogue<br>28-36 Bard<br>37-39 Rogue<br>40    Bard  <br><br>Skills: <br><br>Concentration: 43<br>Discipline: 43<br>Healing: 10<br>Hide: 30 *<br>Move Silently: 30 *<br>Spellcraft: 40<br>Taunt: 43 *<br>Tumble: 40<br>UMD: 25 *<br><br>* These skills are not critical to the build.

Thanks Crispy. I'll take a good look at this tomorrow. Quick question - why shortbow over longbow?<br><br>Thanks!<br>Kaliban.

So he took shortbow probably to save him a feat (martial weapon proficiency) to get longbow.

Is the shortbow much weaker in the hands of an AA than a longbow? Or does it depend on the hardware available on the PW? My PW uses most of the campaign equipment if that helps.<br><br>Thanks,<br>K.

Shortbow is 1d6 as opposed to 1d8 with a longbow, so you will do maybe 1 point less damage on average.  The only real advantage of the longbow is that you may be able to find a better longbow than you could a shortbow if you use the weapons in the OCs.  If you know there are some good longbows that you will want to use, you could take another Weapon Focus in Longbow once you took your first Arcane Archer lvl, but personally I wouldn't bother unless the longbows that you have access to are really that much better.
