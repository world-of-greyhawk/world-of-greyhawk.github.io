Half-Elf would avoid the XP Penalty. Especially when you're not focusing on dexterity it might be a viable choice.<br>_________________<br>Surely, without war there would be no loss - hence, no mourning, no grief, no pain, no misery...

Thing with Half-Elf is they don't get Longbow prof. from Elven Weapon Prof. I'm not sure if Bard gets a bow prof (shortbow?) but Cleric certainly doesn't IIRC, so you'd have to shell out for martial to qualify for AA if you wanted to use Half-Elf.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

this is a semi-popular build on the pw that I play on.  it is done with similar class levels, but the focus of the build is different.<br><br>basically the idea is this.  cleric buffs and arcane archer levels add lots of ab.  this leaves lots of room to raise cha to add divine damage.  So go for 18 or 20 wis, then raise cha for the rest and grab divine might.  you'll have nice ab with all your buffs cast (60+).  With divine might you'll have around 13 divine damage per arrow, then 7 more from cleric spells (divine favor and battletide).  so about 20 irresistable damage per arrow.  With haste and rapid shot you have 6 attacks, so 120 damage per round if all the attacks hit, plus whatever the arrows do, etc...  3x crits on a bow too, so you'll do major damage when you crit.<br><br>I'd also suggest taking the bard level first (for more skill points).  take 2 bard/8 cleric/10 aa pre-epic for max bab.  I would take a third bard level at 37+ to round off skills for a final distribution of 3 bard/16 cleric/21 aa.  16 cleric for longer duration and more mass heals, also if you go 3 bard, 22 aa doesn't give you an ab boost.<br><br>to make it this way, you'll need to re-arrange things a bit (starting stats, etc...).  I just wanted to mention this variant because it works really well. the main problem is that it requires micro-management of spells (constantly recasting cleric ab spells and divine might, etc...).

I quote, IMPROVED INVIS!!! All that playability beats 1 AB by a long shot. Also, you suggest to lose that playability and still go only 20 WIS and then CHA for damage. Better go 22 WIS, then rest CHA with 9 Cleric pre epic. Same AB, but 1 less damage for two tons playability(or thereabouts).<br><br>To the builder. Well built. Tightly planned. I am sure this char is very nice both PvP and PvM in a group. As you say yourself, AC isn't to good so solo will be tougher.<br><br>Really not sure if 43 discipline is very helpful either, but probably good enough in most PvM. Your AC will get higher than that, so not to helpful.

not sure what playability you're talking about.  <br><br>the main problem with the original build is that it does low damage.  If you can kill the bad guys from afar, you won't need ii, because they'll be dead.  you do get ii eventually anyways, so a moot point.  I usually design builds for max power at lvl 40 and I offer suggestions with that in mind.  feel free to disagree, etc... or build it differently.<br><br>also, doing 9 cleric/1 bard/10 aa pre-epic is fine as long as you get 23 aa levels.  you'll have one more damage and the same ab.  but also you won't have as many mass heals (assuming cha route for build). and your cleric buffs won't last as long (could be considered less playability at least at lvl 40).<br><br>that is a fair trade and a minor difference.  if you go the 1 bard route, I'd still suggest taking that at lvl 1 so that you can get x4 bard skills.<br><br>If you're going for a wis based cleric/aa (no cha).  I'd suggest getting more cleric levels.  your important buffs like divine power, aid, prayer, battletide and such will last longer and you'll have lots of wis so you can cast well too.  although if you start down that route, you'll find that your cleric spells are more effective than the archery (at least that's the conclusion that I come to from playing this kind of build).  so maybe only take 9 aa for piercing premonition and the rest cleric or maybe just drop aa in that case, which frees up lots of options for multiclassing.

AGREED!<br><br>I feel your frustrations my friend!  There seems to nothing worse than putting out an idea that you had and have others totally mis-represent your idea!  It is an all to common occurance as of late.  Im thinkin its time we petitioned anuis and grip and add to the rules but allowing only ON TOPIC issues in a post!   What do i mean?  as stated, what does a cha based archer have to do with the build stated?  nothing!  <br><br>peace, and happy holidays <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

my apologies if this has sounded like a pissing match. that was not my intention.  just wanted to offer an alternative way to go.  I've played both types of build and found the cha route more fun to play. that is all.  take care.

pocketbeetle,<br><br>I didn't mean anything against you, but for some reason you took my post personally.  You are the one acting like a child, mocking, etc.  I'd be happy to respond, but since I don't like to be treated like a child, I won't waste any more time on this build.<br><br>***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** <br>For those that wish to play this build, be wary that you'll have a high AB, but will do very low damage against most monsters.  Have a nice day.<br>***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** <br>-pc
