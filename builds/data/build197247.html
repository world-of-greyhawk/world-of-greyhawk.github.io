I think it's so critical to a melee build - that's why I drove for it from character levels 2-7.

the general direction that im going is that, in order for a ranger to really be worth it (RP value not withstanding) he should have  a lot of FEs, that should be the driving goal of ranger builds. <br>you can take a few lvls of ranger early on (up to 9) just to have the better AB and 8 attacks. (6 main and 2 off)<br>after that, you could take 20+ lvls of monk.<br>this will get you all the monk goodness, instead of being able to hit just 6 enemies for +2 ab and 6+2d6 damage more points of damage (and the spot checks and so on).<br>If you know exactly the enemies that you will run into, then its ok, but othewise..<br><br>as it stands, you have something that is neither a monk, nor a ranger.<br>also, do you have a particular preferance for picking shadow dancer? I would pick assasin (and did).<br>you have an extra feat and you get UMD plus with 11 lvs of assasin, you have 6d6 death attacks. with UMD you could cast keen edge spells on your weapons and so buff your self up. Plus you get Imp. Invis as a class feat, so now your Epic Dodge is really useful because every attack has to bypass 50% concealment first, and THEN you can epic dodge it. You actually will have ttwo Imp.Invis, one from monk, one from assasin, that means that if its dispelled, you dont care because you have a back up.<br><br>with that many monk lvls, you dont have to worry about being found out, you can run in and out as if you have HIPS, (gone before they know it, so to speak)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By aluka on 05/30/05 07:00</span></i></p>

Okay, &lt;rubs hands vigorously together&gt; Time to take you to the Learning Tree (again).<br><br>First, I would try to get that Builder Bonus Feat a lot earlier than 41st....pre-epic if at all possible, maybe even before Monk lvl 6th.<br><br>As far as scrappy Ranger/Monks with Epic Dodge, let me introduce you to the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "194348", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Rogue Tiger</a>.  I'm playing that one now through The Sunless Citadel, and I quickly discovered that I was better off scrapping Ranger and going Fighter, but I lost some Role-playing flavor (granted, he only had 9 Ranger levels, but what the hell).  He was also Rogue-based more than anything.<br><br>In your build, though, I would keep Ranger.  However, allow me to show some overlap where you can tighten the build and make the Ranger stronger:<br><br>You take 7 Monk and 10 SD for a total of 17 Character levels.  There's some overlap here.  What you could do instead is take 9 Monk, 5 Shadowdancer, still qualify for Epic Dodge, and have 3 levels to pump into Ranger for 2 more Favored Enemies and a stronger Animal Companion.  Final leveling would be 26/9/5.  <br><br>This will also allow you to take a few more Monk levels in pre-epic to bolster your Saves.  The only thing you really lose is Slippery Mind.  But in gaining those two FEs, he really becomes a bit more of melee beast.  Also, having 8 FEs and Bane will help soothe the Alukas in the community.  The 9 Monk also increases his base speed by 10%.  Too bad there's not room for that 10th Monk level for one more AC bonus.<br><br>It's hard to justify 14 Wisdom with a Ranger because their 4th level spells are just a waste.  In a Monk build, though, it's easily justified.  I suppose you can just look at it as giving the build more Hitpoints, for I would just use the Summon over and over again to absorb bodyblows.<br><br>Other than that, nice build.<br><br>One other note:  it might be worth looking into the leveling mechanics in this build:  If you go the way I suggested, either Monk 9 or SD 5 will have to be taken relatively late in order to max Tumble (either at 36 or 39).  I'm not sure how important that is.  But if you're not taking Bane (arguably the most important feat in this build) until level 39 in the current build, then not really sure.  You could compromise and take only 25 Ranger, 5SD and 9 Monk, get Epic Dodge right away, and then take a 10th level Monk to top out those skills at 40th.  You lose 1 FE, but you gain 1 AC and still the ability to top out skills.  From a playability standpoint from level 1 up, that probably is a good compromise.<br><br>However, in pre-epic, I would advise going 12 Ranger and 8 Monk, and take your 5 SD from 21 to 26, or 26 to 30, and still get Epic Dodge at Level 30.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 05/30/05 13:03</span></i></p>

You could compromise and take only 25 Ranger, 5SD and 9 Monk, get Epic Dodge right away, and then take a 10th level Monk to top out those skills at 40th. You lose 1 FE, but you gain 1 AC and still the ability to top out skills. From a playability standpoint from level 1 up, that probably is a good compromise.<br><br>However, in pre-epic, I would advise going 12 Ranger and 8 Monk, and take your 5 SD from 21 to 26, or 26 to 30, and still get Epic Dodge at Level 30</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>As stated earlier, going 25/10/5 is a compromise for playing from ground up.

Those are excellent comments grizzled.  I love it when everything in a build just fits (just enough monk and SD to get the prereqs for Epic Dodge, just enough Ranger to squeeze out another epic bonus feat).<br><br>Steve

I’d argue in favour of my hasty suggestion yesterday if I didn’t think grizzled’s offering wasn’t superior. With his build you could get your IKD and KD early.<br><br>There are still some minor points to make though. By choosing a Monk 9 and SD 5 build, if you want to get maximum AC from Tumble, this will force you to take Epic Dodge as late on in the levelling as possible. That’s something to take into consideration, since you expressed a desire to get it early.<br><br>Grizzled stated this in his comments, and advised Ranger 25/Monk 10/ SD 5, if ease of levelling was an issue with you, as you indicated it might be. With my suggestion of Ranger 21/Monk 6/SD 13, getting Epic Dodge early and Tumble all the way through the build isn’t an issue at all, nor do you have any ‘wasted’ levels when you hit 40. Epic Dodge is a great feat in any build, but whether getting that early is worth losing two FEs, or taking a compromised ‘wasted’ level is up to you. <br><br>Personally, I’d go with the Ranger 26/Monk 9/SD 5. None of the suggestions above are in the vein of the Bioware Epic Build ‘Dragon Kin’, where all the punch is in the last few levels. You’ll do just fine even if you delay the sweetest parts of this character.<br>_________________<br>If you must mount the gallows, give a jest to the crowd, a coin to the hangman, and make the drop with a smile on your lips.<br><i>-Birgitte</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "5336", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Wheel of Time - The Third Age</a>
