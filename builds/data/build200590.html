<b>PvM build, playable lvl 1-40</b><br><br>That's right, yet another dragon build. I designed it with the goal of having a good shapeshifter druid without using the shifter class, so that he can still get maximum attacks/round. His high wisdom and reasonable caster level make him a good spellcaster druid, but I use that mainly for buffing and occasionally against groups of monsters that just aren't worth the time it takes to shapeshift. I wanted to reach druid lvl 12 as soon as possible for dire bear shape, but I've also taken monk levels early to keep a high AC and to get stunning fist which has a very good DC with his high wisdom. At lvl 40 he has infinate wildshape, elemental shape 3x/day, dragon shape 3x/day.<br>I looked around a bit before posting to make sure this build would not be a copy of an older one and found these two which are rather similar:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "193246", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Christophs Dragon of Torm (Druid 25/CoT 6/Monk 9)</a><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117733", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Dragon Druid by AntonTD (Druid 20/Monk 10/CoT 10)</a><br><br>I decided to post this anyway as I feel it has some advantages.<br><br><b>Race:</b> Human<br><br><b>Abilities:</b><br>Str 10<br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 14<br>Wis 18(34)<br>Cha 8<br><br><b>Level advancement:</b><br><b>1</b> druid 1, toughness, blind-fight<br><b>2</b> monk 1<br><b>3</b> druid 2, extend spell<br><b>4</b> druid 3, (+wis)<br><b>5</b> druid 4<br><b>6</b> druid 5, extra stun attacks<br><b>7</b> monk 2<br><b>8</b> druid 6, (+wis)<br><b>9</b> druid 7, zen archery<br><b>10</b> druid 8<br><b>11</b> druid 9<br><b>12</b> monk 3, weapon focus(kama), (+wis)<br><b>13</b> druid 10<br><b>14</b> druid 11<br><b>15</b> druid 12, max spell<br><b>16</b> CoT 1, (+wis)<br><b>17</b> monk 4<br><b>18</b> CoT 2, empower spell, called shot<br><b>19</b> CoT 3<br><b>20</b> CoT 4, point blank shot, (+wis)<br><b>21</b> monk 5, great wisdom<br><b>22</b> monk 6<br><b>23</b> druid 13<br><b>24</b> CoT 5, great wisdom, (+wis)<br><b>25</b> CoT 6, great wisdom<br><b>26</b> druid 14<br><b>27</b> CoT 7, great wisdom<br><b>28</b> CoT 8, great wisdom, (+wis)<br><b>29</b> druid 15<br><b>30</b> druid 16, dragon shape<br><b>31</b> CoT 9CoT<br><b>32</b> druid 17, (+wis)druid<br><b>33</b> druid 18, epic prowess<br><b>34</b> druid 19<br><b>35</b> CoT 10, armor skin<br><b>36</b> druid 20, epic reflexes, (+wis)<br><b>37</b> druid 21<br><b>38</b> druid 22<br><b>39</b> monk 7, great wisdom<br><b>40</b> druid 23, (+wis)<br><br><b>Skill points:</b> 281<br><br><b>SkillDistribution:</b><br>Consentration 43<br>Discipline 42<br>Spellcraft 43<br>Tumble 40<br>Other skills 113<br><br><b>Some stats:</b><br>Using the "unbuffed (buffed)" format, the buffs in question are:<br>Owl's wisdom<br>Bull's strength<br>Blood frenzy<br>Bark skin<br>Aura of vitality<br><br><b>Human form:</b> (with ranged weapon)<br><b>max HP</b> 460 (580)<br><b>AB</b> 38/33/28/23 (43/38/33/28)<br><b>AC</b> 32 (43)<br><b>saves:</b><br><b>Fort</b> 33 (36)<br><b>Reflex</b> 30 (32)<br><b>Will</b> 40 (46)<br><br><b>Dire bear form:</b><br><b>max HP</b> 540 (660) +40 temp<br><b>AB</b> 37/34/31/28/25/22 (43/40/37/34/31/28)<br><b>Damage</b> 1-8 +10 (1-8 +16)<br><b>AC</b> 39 (50)<br><b>saves:</b><br><b>Fort</b> 35 (38)<br><b>Reflex</b> 32 (34)<br><b>Will</b> 40 (46)<br><br><b>Air elemental form:</b><br><b>max HP</b> 540 (660)<br><b>AB</b> 33/30/27/24/31/18 (39/36/33/30/27/24)<br><b>Damage</b> 2-16 +6 (2-16 +12)<br><b>AC</b> 55 (66)<br><b>saves:</b><br><b>Fort</b> 35 (38)<br><b>Reflex</b> 43 (45)<br><b>Will</b> 40 (46)<br><br><b>Earth elemental form:</b><br><b>max HP</b> 620 (740)<br><b>AB</b> 39/36/33/30/27/24 (44/41/38/35/32/29)<br><b>Damage</b> 2-20 +12 (2-20 +17)<br><b>AC</b> 43 (54)<br><b>saves:</b><br><b>Fort</b> 37 (40)<br><b>Reflex</b> 31 (33)<br><b>Will</b> 40 (46)<br><br><b>Dragon form:</b><br><b>max HP</b> 820 (940) +100 temp<br><b>AB</b> 46/43/40/37/34/31 (51/48/45/42/39/36)<br><b>Damage</b> 2-16 +19 (2-16 +24)<br><b>AC</b> 66 (77)<br><b>saves:</b><br><b>Fort</b> 42 (45)<br><b>Reflex</b> 44 (46)<br><b>Will</b> 40 (46)<br><br><br><b>Things I would like:</b><br><ul><li>Dropping called shot for something more useful, suggestions?<br></li><li>Higher AB<br></li><li>Infinate elemental shape<br></li></ul><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By pulse cap on 06/20/05 21:45</span></i></p>

I worked one out with 12 levels of druid and 8 CoT pre epic, then finished out the wisdom requirement and epic weapon focus and epic prowess using the CoT bonus feats, while using the regular feats for great charisma and saving the last level for monk to max tumble and discipline. The final build was druid/14 Cot/25 monk/1.<br>This allows for a high ab and AC unbuffed in dragon form, while creating a HUGE boost in AB and damage for a short time, toping out around 65 and dealing the usual high damage plus a hefty divine damage bonus.

Weapon focus no.. epic weapon focus yes! The reason for only taking 1 monk level at the end was a symptom of the CoT divine wrath power: past the epics it advances by 2 for every 5 levels. You could always mix it up and take 6 monk levels for the free KD &amp; IKD feats and a little speed boost at the cost of 2 AB from divine wrath and 2 feats. I will post a writeup asap. This was also by no means an easy build to level. The good druid spells all come at higher levels and having all your feats tied up in melee while having no strength, dexterity or constitution is a real drag. All I can say is the ends justify the means.
