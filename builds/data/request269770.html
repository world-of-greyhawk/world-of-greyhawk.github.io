Well, I'm really not sure what the problem is here, you know what you want and what feats you want as well, so just make it?<br><br>I have <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "262121", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>this</a> Druid caster, if it helps, you can easily change Assassin for CoT and change any of the spell focuses for Necromancy, change of race wouldn't be a problem either.<br><br>I find ESF: Discipline useless, your AC will outmatch your max Discipline score. I'm unsure if ESF: Listen would be useful as well...

You can take them if you wish, I wasn't pretending you to use my build straight as it is, just an example... one's build has to be unique after all.<br><br>The thing is I focused on WIS and Spell Focus for Storm of Vengeance; as for penetration feats, well, it isn't a critical feat with so many caster levels, an enemy would need an SR above your caster levels to be able to roll in range, which is unlikely with 37 caster levels, besides, Druids get an interesting spell called <a href="http://www.nwnwiki.org/Nature%27s_balance" target="_blank">Nature's Balance</a> that, as you check its description, lowers SR by large amounts (heck, 7d4 should be able to get some people into negatives), so only crazy SR monks will be able to stand your current penetration ('cause they're immune to SR lowering), and you can still cast Earthquake or Ice Storm which hit through SR.<br><br>Combat casting, on the other hand, is a tricky one, I've got no problem to cast from distance, since you have an Animal Companion, powerful summons, and well, I spam a lot of Storm of Vengeance so most enemies gets stunned right away, or don't even get close, so that's why I didn't take it.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;the skillfocus might be questionable, but in my opinion discipline is even with high AC scores not useless at all.<br>it will help versus natural 20's from knockdown attempts, without discipline a level one fighter could knockdown you with a natural 20.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Where's Epic Dodge when one needs it?<br><br>Come on, a level 1 fighter is excessive, he'd never get close enough, not even hasted he'll hit me before I can cast or send my Animal Companion, I have True Seeing for sneakers as well, so it isn't that simple to get near.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 04/01/07 04:45</span></i></p>

A good melee should knock me down anyway even if I had Discipline due to my low STR score, so better pump AC, I can live knowing natural 20s will KD me even if the enemy can't hit me, the risk isn't all that big, the real risk comes against those who can hit me, at which point a Discipline lower than AC is the same as nothing.<br><br>There is no perfect build, but I consider the risk acceptable, your statement is just as valid, so you don't need to agree with me.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 04/01/07 17:01</span></i></p>
