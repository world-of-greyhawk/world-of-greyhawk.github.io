<b>Playable 1-40 in PvM.</b>  <i>PvP Lite</i> (arcane caster, afterall).<br><br>The discussions about con-centric reciprical damage arcane casters in the general forum inspired me to design one that takes advantage of damage reduction but intentionally keeps a low AC and avoids taking Improved Combat Casting in order to get hit more often.<br><br>No story due to lack of time <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  <br><br>Dwarf, Any Lawful<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 14<br>Con 18<br>Wis 10<br>Int 16<br>Cha 8<br><br>Specialist:  Illusion<br><br>1 Wiz (1): Toughness<br>2 Wiz (2):<br>3 Wiz (3): Extend Spell<br>4 Wiz (4): +1 int<br>5 Wiz (5): Still Spell<br>6 Wiz (6): Empower Spell<br>7 Wiz (7):<br>8 Wiz (8): +1 int<br>9 Wiz (9): Dodge<br>10 Wiz (10): Maximize Spell<br>11 Wiz (11):<br>12 Wiz (12): +1 int, Great Fortitude*<br>13 Wiz (13):<br>14 Wiz (14):<br>15 Wiz (15): Spell Penetration, Greater Spell Penetration<br>16 DWD (1): +1 int<br>17 DWD (2):<br>18 DWD (3): Iron Will*<br>19 DWD (4):<br>20 Wiz (16): +1 con<br>21 Wiz (17): Great Con 1<br>22 Wiz (18):<br>23 Wiz (19):<br>24 Wiz (20): +1 con, Epic Damage Reduction 1, Epic Spell Penetration+<br>25 DWD (5):<br>26 DWD (6):<br>27 DWD (7): Epic Damage Reduction 2<br>28 DWD (8): +1 con<br>29 DWD (9):<br>30 DWD (10): Epic Damage Reduction 3<br>31 Wiz (21):<br>32 Wiz (22): +1 con<br>33 Wiz (23): Great Con 2, Epic Spell (Epic Warding)+<br>34 Wiz (24):<br>35 Wiz (25):<br>36 Wiz (26): +1 con, Epic Fortitude*, Epic Spell (Greater Ruin)+*<br>37 Wiz (27):<br>38 Wiz (28):<br>39 Wiz (29): Epic Skill Focus (Discipline)*, Epic Spell (Epic Mage Armor)+*<br>40 Mnk (1): +1 con<br><br>+ - Wizard bonus feat<br>* - Optional feat but recommended<br><br>Skills - Good amount of points to go around.

You can speed up the process considerably by casting no-save damage spells at the bad guys though.

Defensive stance is cancelled by casting or switching to another mode (such as parry or defensive casting).

Tumble rocks!</b><br>A:  Because like I said, AOOs are actually good for this build.  Every time you provoke an AOO you do damage to the bad guy.  Heck, if casting didn't provoke AOOs and give you the chance to ice storm the enemy, just running around in combat soaking up the AOOs would be one of the best tactics to use.<br><br>It still is a good tactic if you don't want to use spells on the bad guys.<br><br>Drinking potions, too - that provokes AOOs.  Chain-drink cure potions in a crowd to hasten their demise and keep yourself healthy.<br><br><b>Q:  How effective is this really?</b><br>A:  In PvE, it's disgustingly effective.  Your enemies kill themselves.  You can, in some cases, go afk and come back to loot the bodies.<br><br>In PvP you won't be a match for other arcane casters, but you will give SR monks a nasty shock.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 12/02/05 20:30</span></i></p>

I'd take tumble.  you can always lose the ac by going flatfooted. could be useful for when you find that you're taking too much damage too quickly.  sure, you'll lose the attacks of opportunity from moving, but you can still drink potions or cast spells or use a ranged weapon at pointblank if you need a AOE.  In practice, just going flatfooted will generate enough hits against you.<br><br>also, why take epic mage armor with a low ac build?  I guess you could choose to not cast it when you want to use damage shields.<br><br>I'd not bother with +saves feats either.  you'll have decent spellcraft and can cast protection from spells.  This will allow you to make your save against most spells.<br>mind blank protects against all mind effecting spells (any will saves that are non-spells, like fear, etc...).  I also use ironguts to protect against poison.  what else will you use your lvl 1 spells for?  maybe getting +reflex feats to help out your evasion would be a good idea.  could help against traps and monster abilities.<br><br>Overall, I prefer the palemaster build.  crit immunity will protect you more than dr.  Your ac is going to be low with this type of build (intentionally), so you'll be a crit magnet, since most of the critical threats against you will also hit your low ac and cause actual crits.  <br><br>epic warding provides all the dr you'll need for short encounters.  Ideally, you'll get a decent dr belt that can soak up most of the damage from regular encounters. and you can save epic warding for the heavy hitters.<br><br>My palemaster build, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "218273", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Punchy the Lich</a>, is very similar, but also has near optimal dcs for necro/illusion spells, and spends some feats on his heal skill so he can survive longer while people are banging on him.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By jjjhhhlll on 11/09/05 23:22</span></i></p>

Funny *snicker*. I was quite surprised on how much DR you managed. A problem with this strategy is those using ranged weapons, like AAs or bow clerics. They're not going to get hit by your damage shields and with lowish AC will make for a sitting duck but I guess it'll only be much of a problem if you're out of spells.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

Still spell is for spellbook management.  You might in some cases want to put on armor (for example, if you have armor that protects against elemental damage and you are fighting enemies that use that damage time).<br><br>I don't consider silent spell very worthwhile because I can't ever recall being silenced in PvE play.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
