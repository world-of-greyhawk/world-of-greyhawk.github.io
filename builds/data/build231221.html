The Blade Beatus (Level 40 build, but can be effectively played from level 18 on, PvM/PvP)<br><br>-----<br><br>I'm almost embarrassed to post this build.  Actually, scratch that.  I AM embarrassed to post this build.  It's a Divine Power-spamming, dual-wielding, monkey kama-master to make brave men weep, but shockingly, it also seems to be the only one of its kind to have been posted.

This class mix has been done before. Not necessarily in those quantities. But I will admit it does have a distinct waft of fromage in the air. <br><br>Once upon a time, and I forget who it was, put together a Cleric, Monk, WM build that allowed you to gain 12 attacks per round, through dual-wielding Kamas. It might come to me in time... Anyone else remember? I remember testing it out, frankly it was frightening.<br><br>It may have been cdaulepp, sbully or one of their ilk.

Sorry to disappoint you guys, no way to get more than 10/round now, since those bugs he exploited has been fixed. <br><br>Drop Imp Expertise, or at least switch places with Weapon finess, or even take finesse at lvl 3 and you can actually try to play this at low levels. It will still be a drag, though, with little or no damage output until Cleric levels help. But no need at all in this build to take finesse so late. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Shame about that Grim. Hadn't realised that had been fixed.<br><br>Pity really. Even so, with only 10 attacks per round, I'm sure it would still rip you to shreds.

A better level distribution is Cleric 15 / Monk 6 / Weapon Master 19. This gives +1 AC, +20% Speed Bonus &amp; IKD, at the cost of 1 AB &amp; 20 HP. Also the lack of Uncanny Dodge II in a Dex. build is alarming <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">  especially as you have opted for Listen instead of Spot<br><br>You use an awful lot of Epic feats to get all your Two-Weapon Fighting feats. Also I see no need for Improved Expertise, you would be much better off to take improved critical instead. If you could stand to only use one weapon, you could boost your AB &amp; AC by 2 by taking more Great Dexterity feats...<br><br>...&amp; btw you stated a +9 from Divine Power which in this case is incorrect:<br><br>BAB = 24 (0 from 1 monk pre-epic, 11 from 15 cleric pre-epic, 4 from 4 Weapon Master pre-epic, 10 in epic levels)<br><br>this translates to a +6 from divine power.<br><br>However it is easy to make it so that you have BAB=16 at lvl 20 giving the full 6 attacks...a much more powerful version of the build is as follows:<br><br>1-4 monk: dodge, mobility, weapon focus<br>5-15 cleric: expertise, spring attack whirlwind attack, weapon finesse<br>16-20 weapon master: improved critical<br>21-23 cleric: great dex I<br>24 monk<br>25-36 weapon master: great dex I-VI, epic weapon focus, epic prowess<br>37 monk<br>38 cleric<br>39-40 weapon master: great dex VII, armor skin<br><br>(i hope that is not too unreadable!)<br><br>change the starting stats a little:<br><br>str-8<br>dex-17 (32) &lt;---great dex 1-7, 8 ability increases<br>con-11<br>int-12<br>wis-16 (18) &lt;---put 2 ablitlity increases here.<br>cha-8<br><br>you end up losing a few skill points so you would have to drop concentration to 27 &amp; spellcraft to 29, taking spot instead of listen... the only other loss is a few HP...oh and the dualwhielding!<br><br>ATTACKS:<br><br>64/61/58/55/52/49<br><br>26 BAB + 11 dex bonus + 19 buffs (4 divine power, 5 GMW, 1 prayer, 1 aid, 1 bless, 2 battletide, 5 divine favor) +4 wf/ewf/ep +4 weapon master levels)<br><br>with +6 to add to this assuming you can buff dexterity by +12 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  ---&gt;70 for the first attack <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"><br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!

Someone mentioned getting the better base AB up for the extra attack but if he is building a "Divine Power Spamming" build he is better off with the base 3 attacks per round as Divine Power will then add the extra attacks at his Full Base Attack bonus.<br><br>Does Divine Power if cast twice still add another attack? I think there used to be a bug that caused this.

DP does not add another attack if you cast it a second time in the current patch - not sure if it did in older ones.<br><br>Although dropping his BAB down to 12 will let him get 2 attacks at full BAB from DP, this build has enogh buffs that he will likely reach the +20 cap, so it will cost him 3 off his final buffed AB. Not worth it IMHO.<br><br>TM

Four more monk levels would probably be a good idea.  Dual-wielding is up for personal choice, but remember that without the need for Improved Expertise, I'll be taking one less of them in epic levels.  Still, you could drop them for Blind Fight, or maybe Extend Spell, and a pair of Great Dex feats, which might be better.<br><br>Whoops!  I was factoring the strength bonus increase into the AB buff from Divine Power, even though the build has Weapon Finnesse.  Okay, drop +9 to +5.<br><br>As stated, when spamming Divine Power, it's better to have less attacks than more, because the ones you get from the spell are made at the highest AB, rather than being added at -3 (or -5 for non-monks) at the bottom of the attack schedule.  And, as far as I know, it only works once, but this build still gains two attacks from it (from +15 to +20, a monk gains attacks at +16 and +19).<br><br>You're right, krsboss, it's not truly unstoppable.  There are four more words which might apply just as much as yours:  Isaac's Greater Missile Storm.  It's still pretty uber, though.
