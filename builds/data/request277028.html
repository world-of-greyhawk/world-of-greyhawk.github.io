I'm looking for an evil build that can survive a smiter Paladin. Preferably not a dwarf, and being able to cast magic would be a plus. I'm thinking perhaps a rogue/wiz with high AC and epic dodge so the hit wouldn't come in the first place, though perhaps someone else has a better idea?

If you want to beat smiters then why choose to be evil? being neutral is the no brainer technique.

He wants an evil build that can survive smiters, pretty hard to not make it evil then, isn't it? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br>Probably a faction thing.<br><br>It always depend on how good those smiters are, if they're good enough not even ED might save you. I've beaten ED'ers with smiting, but it takes patience and timing(count your attacks, know where in the round you are etc). I have found however that many smiters just unleash all thre smites in quick succession just after combat is initiated. What you need is to survive all smites with a little margin. Epic dodge, concealment and bard song is a nice recipe. Of course, if you're a caster (or UMD scrolling?) you can just go Bigbys overpowered finger. <br><br>A few ways. If he won't have true sight; High stealth, HiPS, bow and loads of SA.(Rogue/Asn/SD) Comes with Imp invis or even the undispellable Self-Concealment.<br>Bard/Rogue or Bard/SD 3rd class whatever. Rogue13 or SD10 to get ED, then Bardsong to improve AC, reduce AB of your opponent and to get that bonus undispellable. Comes with nice buffs, among them II, but holyswords can be a pest so he might wait that out behind a Divine Shield.<br><br>Another way is a Dwarven(yeah yeah) Palemaster with high CON. Crit immune, good AC and might just get enough HP's to withstand the smites.<br><br>I could go on and on, but I'll stop for a while right now. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

apart from those ways two other possibly effective solution I'll add is to use a sorc/bg/monk with at least 6 monk and 2 bg. I very rarely see any smiters with monk speed, and unless you have to worry about some insanly undispellable rods of ultravision/see invis and true sight, 32 mage is effective at mording these things unless they're buffed by some other high level caster.<br><br>So, anyway, mord first, darkness second, then lay waste with maximised and empowered icestorms (targets all) IGMS (targets hostile) horrid wilting (affects your team and hostiles, but not you)and even maximsed and empowered flame arrow can work if they have no evasion.<br><br>If you don't like running though you could try a high ac and con mage. 36 sorc, 3 bg 1 monk. take div shield, give yourself a base of 20 cha, the rest con, some int for skills, epic mage armor, epic warding, and level 9 shape change. assuming you can get haste and max your dex, cha and wis you'll have about 80 ac in dragon form after divine shield, and about 75 in golem form but more hp. Not too familiar with the other shapes, but those two might make you a challenge to kill<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By D O'Brien123 on 07/01/07 08:24</span></i></p>
