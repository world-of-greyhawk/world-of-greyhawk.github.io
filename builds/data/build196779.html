I'm not sure if the OP will see this or not, but I was curious as to what type of skill distribution was used here?  Also, what benefit do you get from the Monk level?

Tumble dump and evasion. I'd go for bard to have access to spellcraft and UMD too.<br><br>Funny the idea of dual wielding hammer and sickle, that's a big kudos for style.<br><br>Skill distribution? I'd say max discipline, tumble, spellcraft and concentration.

But why would you multiclass with monk and not use kama? 3 extra attacks per round, and you would get some feats since it's only 1 kind of weapon to specialize, focus, epic specialize, epic focus.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/14/06 23:37</span></i></p>

BTW, isn't the kama supposed to be an oriental kind of sickle?

Cool, thanks for all the info guys.  I think I'm going to give this one a shot.  I'll post again with the results.  Don't know when that will be though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

LOL, even if it is, a kama can't substitute the sickle in the comunist flag, but it would be as senseless, the AB and extra attacks wouldn't work if your other hand has a non-kama weapon. And now that I think of it, your AC might drop if changed the weapons to kama (not saying I wouldn't do it anyway)...... since you can't use heavy armor and you don't have high WIS to counter that.
