I was looking for a melee/caster that isn't a ftr/cleric like every other build I see on the pw I play. Also, dev crit and epic dodge are disabled.<br><br>I like Mith's magic maruader but was told a ftr/wiz/wm is a deadly combination.<br><br>Would I be better off with wm or pm? Any ideas or opinions would be appreciated.<br><br>Thanks

If so, then go with the PM.<br><br>Otherwise, I'd look into the FTR/WIZ/WM build. You could go with lots of WIZ for the spellcasting, or lots of melee levels for combat prowess.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Thanks Cin,<br><br>It's a concern but not an overriding one. Think I'll try the WM option.<br><br>I hope some others reply to this. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Palemaster has changed recently. Don't expect new spell levels from it, but you are also sneak immune as well as crit immune since the last patch, making it even more tank desireable. A well put together fighter bard pale-master can achive an AC that would make some arcane archers curse their luck for meeting him while dishing out tons of damage.

A dex based bard/wm/pm is even better. You can cast some good buffs like improved invis, ab is good, nice crits, you get a nice curse song, lasting inspiration, tons of skillpoints.<br>_________________<br>Rygar, great roller of 2's
