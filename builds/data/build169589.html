Apart from epic dodge and very good damage reduction he's pretty average, hardly a tank in my opinion. I would not call naked AC of 30 huge.

errr, k, the point of the build was to get epic dodge with exelent DR. also, i never said his naked AC was good, i said that he will have a huge AC because of the monk bonus, which in my oppinion is only taken advantage of when ur talking about AC with items, so naturaly, his naked AC would be nothing specail, his AC becomes pretty damn good when u factor in special monk boots robes, and the wis bonus.

Factoring in gear when determining the quality of the build isnt really how it works.<br>He has a wisdom of 10. How is he going to get a wisdom bonus to AC?  His only positives to his AC are his tumble and his dexterity.<br>He has good DR from all the DwD levels etc but the AC from "monk" is only from tumble.  The wisdom was not used at all.  + 0 gets you nothing to my understanding.

Why even wear robes? It will not help much. Even in full plate with a shield a monk will keep his special feats (evastion, diamond body, ect) AND he'll keep epic dodge too. This also might be a little better as his fists won't be doing a lot of damage anyway.<br><br>The disadvantage to this would the the lack of an effective HIPS, but as a tank you usually wouldn't want to use it anyway.

the problem with whearing full plate is that i loose almost all of my dex bonus. *** far as using a shield goes, using a shield would give me fewer attacks per round because it voids the monks ab bonus unfortunently.
