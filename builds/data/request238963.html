Well, you're going to need at least one level of SOR or WIZ in there to qualify for AA. Did you want to be able to use all your Pally spells? If so, you need 14 WIS and at least 15 Pally levels.<br><br>For melee, did you want to go with a finessable weapon and high DEX? Or perhaps go with STR and let the AA bonus take care of your ranged AB?<br>_________________<br>Where I'm playing now: <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk.</a>

I was thinking maybe bard<br><br><br>and the pally spells are optional<br><br>And yes High dex is a factor, i thought maybe a pair of rapiers and the finesse feat, or something else I don't know i've tried everything<br><br><br>And at least 20 ending charisma so the divine shield and divine might last for a decent number of rounds

I would probably make simple Paladin 9 / Bard 2 / Arcane Archer 29, it's just a simple 9 Paladin, then Bard, all the way Arcane Archer, and the last level Bard for skilldupms, you can use Bard's song for +1 Ab and damage.... Divine Favor ends with +3, in case you want to use it, you would only need 11 WIS for that one, you can get Aid too, but you would need 14 WIS to be able to get a level 2 slot.<br><br>20 ending CHA is somewhat high though... alright, I'll make the build right here and see how it goes.<br><br>Elf<br><br>STR 12<br>DEX 17 (26)<br>CON 10<br>WIS 11<br>INT 12<br>CHA 14 (24)<br><br>Raise CHA every time<br><br>1 Paladin1 - Point blank shot<br>3 Paladin3 - Divine Might<br>6 Paladin6 - Divine Shield<br>9 Paladin9 - Weapon Focus Longbow<br><br>Alignment change<br><br>10 Bard1<br>11 Arcane Archer1<br>12 Arcane Archer2 - Rapid Shot<br>15 Arcane Archer5 - Improved Critical longbow<br>18 Arcane Archer8 - Called Shot<br>21 Arcane Archer11 - Epic Weapon Focus longbow<br>24 Arcane Archer14 - Epic Prowess, Great DEX I (18)*<br>27 Arcane Archer17 - Great DEX II (20)<br>28 Arcane Archer18 - Great DEX III (19)*<br>30 Arcane Archer20 - Great DEX IV (21)<br>32 Arcane Archer22 - Great DEX V (22)*<br>33 Arcane Archer23 - Great DEX VI (23)<br>36 Arcane Archer26 - Great DEX VII (24), Great DEX VIII (25)*<br>39 Arcane Archer29 - Great DEX IX (26)<br>40 Bard2<br><br>* Bonus Feats<br><br>Status.... eh....

Oh hell, Divine Might/Shield needs 13 STR... well, that shouldn't be so hard to change.... fit it yourself if you want, I don't really think you'll use my build exactly anyway.<br><br>Of course, Weapon Finesse, I forgot you wanted decent melee.... and Divine Might should cover well the damage part so it's ok. I don't have space pre-epic, I even had to leave IC into epics, but you could as well take Weapon Finesse in epic levels or move around stuff since pre-epic, (I would leave the prerequisite-AA feats and Divine feats as they are) -1 Great DEX anyway, and having an odd DEX score is wrong so probably Armor Skin to fix stuffs.<br><br>You wouldn't be wanting also WF and EWF in a melee right? I think leaving DEX high is better if you're counting to use it both ways, you could even drop EWF, but since WF in a bow is a requirement for Arcane Archer, I'd say EWF is worth it. Or take WF in melee instead of Armor Skin and EWF in melee instead of EWF in ranged, since ranged will have a high AB anyway you could concentrate in improving your melee AB.
