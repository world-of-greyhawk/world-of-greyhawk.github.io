I went through the list of builds and only found two Monk/RDD characters. So I made one.<br><br>Human<br>Lawful Neutral<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>Str: 10 (18)<br>Dex: 14 (16)<br>Con: 12 (14)<br>Wis: 16 (30)<br>Int: 12 (14)<br>Cha: 16 (18)<br><br>Level Progression:<br>Monk x 7<br>Sorc x 1<br>RDD  x 10<br>Monk x 9<br>Sorc x 7<br>Monk x 5<br>Sorc x 1<br><br>Skills:<br>Max Tumble, Spellcraft, and Discipline. Dump the rest into whatever (probably Listen, Concentration and Heal.<br><br>Spells:<br>Taking 9 Sorc levels gives you access to Stoneskin and Elemental Shield, and Displacement.<br><br>Naked and unbuffed AC = 37 (my Monk 16/ Sorc 9/ RDD 15 gives you a naked AC of 38, and more hit points, but suffers from a lack of Attack bonuses)<br><br>I believe the Monk's ability of Concealment stacks with the Displacement spell, but I'm not sure. If it did, you'd be 100% concealed for 9 rounds. <br><br>Final HP is just above 300, but with a bit of gear, this guy should be pretty hard to damage. <br><br>I take the Epic Fortitude and Epic Reflexes feats because he is a bit low in those saves, and I focus on the Unarmed Strike. <br><br>He's a good Neutral fighter with a decent familiar/distraction animal.

The only thing that would give you a great deal of AB with this build is true strike. the 20monk/1sorc/19Rdd would have the same oppertunity to get true strike and more HP, 2 epic feats, which your build doesn't have from lvls, and that will make the better choice, considering that you would have more battle prowess and hp. I would go with 20monk/1sorc(bard)/19rdd anytime

I have had some fun playing a Monk/RDD character that ended up being Monk 29/Sorc 1/RDD 10.  I am not a great builder, so it was far from maximized, but it was a lot of fun and made for a very strong character.<br><br>I ended up going the munchkin dual-kama route (I know, lame), and basically split stat increases into STR, DEX and WIS.  The character is fairly well balanced between offense and defense, and can cast from scrolls and use wands.  Very good naked AC, low HP, low AB, good saves.<br><br>I like this build combination, though, because at its maturation (which I consider the point where the build reaches 20 Monk levels and 10 RDD levels) it has a laundry list of immunities that serve to make this character very, very effective.<br><br>I have not played around much with variations on this build (such as more Sorc levels) but I plan on looking into them.

I go for more Sorc levels for the Stoneskin and Elemental Sheild that I mentioned. <br><br>With the a Monk 20/ Sorc 1/ RDD 19 I could've had a Dev. Crit with the Kamas, but I was bored with that kind of character, and I don't ever use the breath weapon.

Out of curiosity (because I am probably just missing it), what is the advantage of the 21st Monk level, as opposed to taking the 11th level of RDD?  I know that RDD at that point has a higher hit die.  Does the Monk get a Monk bonus feat at that point that the RDD would not?

Nope, just another point of spell resistance.

if you grabbed 21 levels of monk in the beginning, then you'd get an epic monk feat at 21? go 1 sorc, grab the rdd levels, another 7 sorc finish with a monk level... I've not tested yet, and i don't remember if epic rdd gives /anything/ that makes it worth taking, but i'm not sure. I dunno, just a suggestion, and should be treated like one.. So..

Monk 21 gives you another 10% speed boost. Every three levels, remember? So instead of 60% with monk 20, you get 70% with monk 21.<br>And to that last one, no, you don't get an extra feat at 21, even if you do them all in a row... not quite sure what kind of difference that's supposed to make.<br><br>As for the reason "one more point of spell resistance," I just thought I'd point out that, as far as I am aware, a caster gets 10+caster level to beat SR. So a level 17 caster (which is probably the lowest you have to worry about in terms of offensive casting) will automatically get 27 to beat your SR, without even factoring in feats. Spell penetration pops it on up to 29. That's versus your 31 SR, so either 80% or 90% penetration, without even factoring in Mordekainen's. Against any caster with 21 levels or higher, your SR would be completely useless. I'd do it for the 10% speed boost, or not at all, personally.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By yrtsns on 02/10/05 15:12</span></i></p>

Hmmm, I don't know about the Grimoire, but I just leveled a monk from 20th to 21st online a week or two ago, and he was faster.  In fact, I regret it a little because hasted he's hard to navigate in narrow twisting passages, and smashes into walls alot in 'drive' mode.<br><br>Of course, I've been wrong once or twice in my life.  Not in front of my NWN machine so I can't test it.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By King Ubu on 02/10/05 20:33</span></i></p>

Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's every three levels... I'd have to say the Grimoire is probably wrong, though I haven't played monks over about level 15 (don't see much reason), so I couldn't say for sure. The Grimoire may be basing that on the manual which says "Every 3 levels, the monk's movement speed will increase by an additional 10%" for epic monk. It should have said something more like "The monk's movement speed will continue to increase by 10% every 3 levels," so that it sounded more continuous. It would be odd to have a gap from 18 to 23. Besides, the Grimoire should list 160% at 18-20, so that also surprises me.<br>Anyways, I do believe it would be 170% at level 21. It sounds like the previous poster has experienced that firsthand.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?
