<i>Seeking the “People’s Justice” and lending aid to the needy PvM (1-40) and PvP</i><br><br><b>Green Knight (“Wildwood Mercenary”)</b><br>(b)By Deborah “Tyr” Templar[b/b]<br><br><i>This build is part of the Robin Hood series, and has been revised in accordance with comments by Grim, in terms of the build; I’d also very much like to thank TM and the Dwarflord (whose valuable comments RP-wise made me re-think this character, such that he has been redubbed in memory of Will Scarlett, a noble similar to Robin Hood who turned outlaw (and in some stories is said to be Robin’s cousin), after he hunted down and avenged his murdered wife (or was it his father, as some tales say), by seeking revenge and killing those responsible for her death; hence, taking the law into his own hands, when (allegedly) no one in authority would assist him, and thus forced afterwards to take to the woods, where he met up with Robin and became a mercenary (or so the tales say; and he went onto rescue a princess, allegedly held captive by “Turkish Giants” with Robin and Tuck which, along with Maid Marion’s persuasive insistence, led to an eventual pardon, for Robin Hood and his merry clan. Scarlett was said to be a weapon master, who carried a broadsword, (as opposed to the rapier which was back then the “civilized weapon” of nobles, for mere civilians many said). He is also said to have fancied fine clothes and carry a rose, and was sometimes said to be musical. To see the original build (and all the great comments), <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "270516", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>   . </i><br><br>The Build:<br>Hence, the class combination, effective RP value and, build-wise, also effective, with very good / high AB, and also impressive damage output, thanks not only to WM crits (which be the reason for same), but also epic Ranger bane, covering off all 7 playable races, which also very nicely multiplies on a crit – as such, this build is a testament to the ranger as melee’rs proper. Also, good HPs, pretty good stealth (for a str-based character), and decent AC (thanks to expertise, which alone covers off the difference between leather and plate); the main draw back of this build are saves, but are “saveable” thanks to ranger buffs and UMD (that said, you’ll also want to keep clarity potions on hand to cover off your otherwise problematic will save, in the event your scroll-case be empty); while somewhat “bare bones” due to the WM prereqs, this knight has what he needs, incl. an animal companion; as such, this knight shines solo PvM, and is also solid in PvP as against other meelee’rs, and he capably dishes on behalf of any party.
