I would also dump points into Discipline on the CoT levels as well. But the choice is up to you.<br>_________________________________<br><br>Build notes:<br>This is somewhat of a concept build, but I did a bit of testing in the Novice to Epic Mod at different levels and using different forms and it is decently effective.  I basically wanted to make a Druid with a mix good spell casting and good natural forms.  Due to comments in a thread long past by cdaulepp; I thought I would throw the Improved Unarmed Fighting and Stunning Fist into the mix to give the shapes an extra punch (no pun intended).  <br><br>With such a high Wisdom, and Owl's Insight, rarely were the Stunning Fists resisted.  The only class that seemed to give me any problem were the high-dex rogues. Which is why I chose Necromancy as a spell focus. If I had trouble hitting them, I would just pop back into natural form and use Slay Living or Finger of Death on them.  Otherwise, I had very little trouble with the Fighters at during my leveling testing (stun them and then beat them to death).<br><br>Before you say it, yes, putting even one level of Monk in here would put this build into a whole different level. Upping the AC by 19 at level 40; and giving an extra 2 attacks per round with your shapes.  But, as Druid-Shifter-Monks are so ubiquitous, I wanted  to try something that is still feasible, but a little more palatable to the RP-minded. <br><br>I had toyed around with the idea of taking 4 levels of CoT pre-epic for an extra attack per round; but after some consideration, I felt that it was better to get the spell Shapechange as early as possible.<br><br>Also, let me add that with the high Stunning Fist DC, good management of the Panther companion can really make an impact in battle.  Have your Panther stay back while you cast any spells and then shift into a form for melee. Then when everyone is focused on you, let your panther devastate their flanks.  The panther is a bit fragile, but with Barkskin, Stoneskin, Empowered Bull's Strength and Greater Magic Fang, he (she?), can handle (and dish out) quite a bit more damage.<br><br>If you have any questions about the shape stats, you can check the Grimiore (if you do a search, someone should have a link to it) all the stats are there.  But for the sake of comparison, I am going to list the AB and AC of the various shapes. Both normal and buffed (Barkskin and Empowered Bulls Strength).<br><br>Normal (Unbuffed)<br>Bear       Wolf       Boar       Panther      Badger<br>AC 16     AC 20    AC 20     AC 20         AC 23<br>AB 35     AB 32    AB 33     AB 32         AB 27<br><br>Fire Ele.

I'm also not certain what properties are merged. I've seen different charts for the Shifter, but not on the Druid natural forms.  From a little testing it appears that it's Armor and perhaps items, but not Weapons (or bracers, iirc).<br><br>Anyway,  it's no Shifter-Monk; but it is a Druid that makes good use of his natural forms and spells.  Probably only good in a low magic environment, though.<br><br>Cheers.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 12/26/05 15:23</span></i></p>

It should be noted that the moment you take monk you link your stunning fists uses per day to your monk lvl. That's the only reason not to take monk IMO and compared to free improved unarmed attack, monk's progression for your unarmed forms, cleave, evasion and <b>+13 AC (+19 w/WIS capped)</b> that just one lvl of monk would give (when the 11th lvl of CoT gives just +2HP)it's a veeery  weak reason...<br><br>But maybe I'm just a powergamer <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Conjuration for the reasons you listed above, and Necromancy for the Slay Living and Finger of Death.  Had I not strapped myself for Feats, I would have taken both. I'm not sure why I ended up taking Necromancy, other than it seemed to end quite a few fights pretty quickly.  I had thought about taking an epic spell focus, but in epic levels the spells rarely failed.<br><br>The Epic Energy Resistance was only taken because there wasn't much left from the Druid Bonus feat list.  You could substitute an Epic Spell instead; perhaps Hellball or Greater Ruin (pity no Epic Warding).<br><br>For some reason, I was thinking that WF and EWF Unarmed Combat didn't work with the Druid's Shapes.  I thought that someone had said that they showed up in the character sheet but didn't actually make it into the actual combat rolls.  If I am incorrect, then yes, I would want to work those in.<br><br>Your right, Barbarian would fit nicely into the concept of a nature-worshipping Druid changing into a huge bear and attacking with tooth and claw.  Plus the Uncanny Dodge would be nice too.  I had toyed around with making the last two levels: Rogue (39) and CoT (40) for a Tumble and Discipline Point Dump, but in the end I decided to stay as pure Druid as possible as it seemed a little cheesy otherwise.  Of course at that point I would probably just say "damn the torpedoes, I'm taking some Monk!!"<br><br>Anyway, thank you for the good suggestions.  If anyone can confirm the WF, EWF Unarmed combat thing, I would appreciate it as I will need to adjust my feats.
