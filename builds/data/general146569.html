She frequently makes attacks on other peoples builds without really justifying it(see the Wizard 38/SD2 thread that was posted). <br><br>We have her outright lying (having posted saying she suggested I use a rapier in my swashbuckler build) and saying I am a hypocrit for posting a rough build in the general hotu thread when somone asked.

ok, Tyr is a good char builder when she takes her time<br>"new ultimate archer"/"battle dwarven cleric" look at the reply posts<br>now if Tyr makes a mistake i,m sure she wants it brought to her attention so she can fix it{like she already has}<br>..<br>i cant find Tyr,s post but Tyr says her game is broken or different as she has said she can do these things, like get epic {"something" cant remember} at cot lvl 12 when everyone else can only get it at lvl 14 <br>i think that was it!{i,ve seen the post but can,t find it}<br>then.. the battle dwarven cleric 39 monk 1 it was suggested why not take 1 bard for bardsong instead of monk..now if Tyr wanted bard she would have taken it BUT she wanted cleric 39 monk 1<br>fare enough i say its her build.. <br><br>also she has stated she used lockindals "thundering barbarian"build but altered it to her taste..and changed the name...that makes it a different build..again fare enough i say....Lockindal has not said that he dont approve of Tyr using his build as a blueprint for her to alter to her taste..<br><br>whoever reads the replies to Tyr,s build,s can make thier own minds up if they want to make the build or not..<br><br>it also seems to me although some replies to her builds are not insulting Tyr is taking them as insulting and replies with an insult.. so any insulting posts by "anyone" not just Tyr will be deleted..<br><br>now ..Tyr has asked me to delete all 20 of her builds which i have done ..also she has requested i delete all her posts<br><br>..so as a moderator i,m going to respect her wishes and delete them as requested to do so {well not all}<br>.. so as you can see Tyr is trying to make amends<br><br>...come on all lighten up ..give Tyr a break<br><br>i for one want Tyr <b>IN</b> the guild<br>well those are my thoughts on this...griphook<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 08/09/04 14:50</span></i></p>

Syrath101, cry me a river.<br><br>Anyway, I just wanted to tell, that I'm having a moderator erase all my builds. Many will be repost, but only the ones I've been pleased with and work. This includes Fifur Gest. I've PM one of the mods to also watch over ANY posts that contain false accusation of stealing, links or indirect comment. I already shown that I've made the Fifur Gest before Lock did.<br><br>Also her log out date for the Royal Black Watch was 11:03 PM, Feburary 16 of this year. Her original build was DwD 23/WM 7/FTR 10, she was strength based and she originally wielded a bastard and tower shield. (I'm look at the build now as we speak.)

People have different methods of creating something that fulfills that purpose.  Me personally, I would choose to have some levels in CoT, since you're not worrying about spell ability that much (except for when you need to lay the smack down with a Word or two).  Others seem to be suggesting that some attribute changes might increase the character's versatility by taking advantage of some of the unique aspects of the cleric class (such as spellcasting and access (possibly) to Epic Spells), so that the build won't be just a "wannabe paladin with a greater fighting prowess".  Others would say that if you want to play a wannabe paladin, you should just play a paladin.  Me, I don't care.  Play whatever you want.

TyrPaladin, perhaps you shouldn't be so hostile towards people giving you advice. Then most likely people will treat you much better. I for one post very bluntly towards your posts because you treat others including myself so rudely. You have a habit of thinking any advice on your builds is an attack on you or something. You get extremely defensive, and a useless arguement errupts. You toss around moron and stupid comments when you could simply just say, 'I can see what you are trying to point out, bu my reason was this...'. Also you sit and nitpick people over things like names of builds or taking a level of a class for an ability, instead of saying your piece and being done with it. You do it on this guild's forums, as well as the main bioware forums. It has earned you very little respect from me and as late posting trends seem to show many others. Despite any despise I have towards you for your behavior, I still post giving advice on how to improve your builds, and your ever so kind response is moron this, stupid that. Until you change your behavior, I will post with the same bluntness about your builds. I won't be rude about it. I will just say this could be better, or this is wrong. To be honest I hope you will change your behavior, as I bet a lot of others will then follow in suit.

Other times, the suggestions people make are rules oriented/nuts-and-bolts suggestions that don't require much play to see and determine.  The build may just not be that complex or may be similar to something the author has tried on his/her own before and not posted.  Still other times, the suggestions are questions about why the builder chose to take a feat when he/she did or one class instead of another.  None of these would require playtesting before suggestion.  Most of the problem comes in how you perceive the majority of these suggestions and respond to them.

Couldn't you do the same thing just with wizard spells?".  Your response was basically, "This build is no better than a rogue with a wand.  This build sucks.  Any of my builds could whup it at any time."  That's not only rude, it's completely unhelpful.<br><br>How would you feel if I said, "Your battle cleric build sucks.  I could do the same thing -- only better -- with a fighter/weaponmaster with 1 level of bard at the very end to get 43 ranks in Tumble and UMD.  It'll be able to cast anything your build can and more, since it could cast 9th level cleric AND wizard spells as well as having better fighting capabilities."  Is that helpful?

LMAO!!  <br><br>Wow!  In all my time on this earth I have never seen such pettiness!  Scratch that!  I have: on a grade school playground! <br><br>Tyr, i have read your posts/replies to builds over the short time I've been here and PLZ learn about maturity!    It is SO unfortunate that you feel that everything is an attack on you.  It is even MORE unfortunate to see that you have the need to point out YOUR opinions to SOMEONE's build.  It is THEIRS sweety, not yours.  So really, besides the minor thoughtless placement of a Feat here or there, there really is NO reason to point out YOUR opinion, cuz opinions sweety are really the cheapest commodities on earth and NO1  really cares (look at the list of ppl postin here love  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">   ).  Oh, and this whole thing bout "who created the build first  blah blah blah!" like the good man said, we only have so many choices!  For all you know I may have built EVERY combo in nwn existance so then all YOUR builds would be copys of mine!  Oh, cuz they arent posted here doesnt mean they dont exist love! (the internet is a big big place  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   )<br><br>SO really, this whole thing comes down to one thing: Tyr grow up and learn to live by the name you call yourself!  A paladin would NEVER be so petty to let others get into their heads with mere words!  A paladin is much to MATURE for that   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>BTW, Tyr, i will not respond to anything you have to say.. The fact that a post was startd bout you is MORE than enough proof that you really need to think bout what you are.  Sadly, the internet is rampant with ppl who THINK they are great (because in real life they are not).  BUT the amazin thing i find is people can't really hide behind who they are!  So before you think about attacking me (cuz i know its coming  you are way to immature for it to not) STOP and think:  avado has given me a chance to grow as a human/elf/dwarf/halfling  (what ever you are) and more importantly, as a paladin.  <br><br>One last thing, you should really stop playin the "uber/fast lvlin" servers.  Come to a real server where you have to not only design an epic char, but play it ALL the way through.  It is one thing to say "take monk at lv 40 for the ac blah blah".  It is an entirely different matter to get that char there!  And think bout it: if you did lv to 39, WHY what possible difference could it make to have 1 monk lv at 40?  Cuz it looks good on paper?  LMAO   <br><br>To all those NOT Tyr, i think we should all be nice to her.  She is a young child who really needs a hug.<br><br>Here Tyr,  avado *hugs* tyr  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>There, now im all warm and fuzzy!  How bout you?<br><br>PEACE

Nice doesn't work either a lot of times. Constructive criticism doesn't. It's only when you point out obvious flaws that needs fixing that you will make any headway. Therefor that's my approach to her builds. If I see an error I'll point it out. If not it can stagnate in the forums. Of course as we all know that still means a lot of posts towards her builds <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> .
