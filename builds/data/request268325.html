Try a LN monk, wisdom based with as many combat trick type feats as possible and zen archery to get him to the epics. Take him to level 20 and switch to druid till you qualify for drakeshape. You will have a decent ab, high ac and saves and the monk attack progression. You may even throw in a few levels of a melee class pre epic to get the extra attacks.

A good wisdom-based monk build is sort of an oxymoron. The problem is a Wis-based monk will have good AB and hjigh DC for SF, but have such a low AB that he can't land a hit (and thus the enemy will never need to make a roll to beat that DC).<br><br>The only good Wis-based builds are Cleric or Druid builds that a few Monk levels to get the Wis-AC boost. I don't consider them to be Monk builds, though.<br><br>If you download the PRC, there is a feat there called Intuitive Strike. It is like Weapon Finesse, except that it applies your wisdom bonus to AB. With that, a wis-monk becomes playable. You still can't get Epic Dodge, though, and the PRC implementation makes the Wis bonus count towards the +20 magic cap, so at high levels you will top out between gloves and wisdom. This makes it not as good as dex or str based monks, but playable. Without they are really quite poor.<br><br>TM
