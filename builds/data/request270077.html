Any ideas on a melee character with a high dev crit and generally good AC? Cant be RDD/PM/Wiz/Cler/Sorc/Druid/SD and prob not of evil alignment either. <br><br>Bard is okay if under 13 levels of it. Build is for PvM/PvP and preferable using a single handed weapon, no two weapon fighters. Weapon could possibly be scimmy if going the WM route (I'm a crap builder btw <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  )<br><br>Paladin would be okay as a smite-aholic but alignments for all creatures is too diverse to work. On a server with say +5 items are highest. Endalyor plays on the same one if that helps <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Not sure of the norm AC <br><br>Preferably not dwarf also, or any of the short ones <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  bigger than elf-halfelf is fine <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  (inclusive)

It should be known, that capping 2 stat categories is very easy on this server, with little-to-no faction gear.  So, STR and CON could be completely capped via gear alone, without feats/spells/potions.  +5 is the highest AC and weapon enhancements go, though.

Bugger...<br><br>Then I guess there isn't too much to do about STR, you can't use RDD anyway. If you only want decent AC you can always go with a Cleric / Weapon Master, that settles about all your stats to good numbers.

He says no Cleric either. Making it tough on himself. i would really think fighter/bard/WM, or mayyyybe Bard/CoT/WM, that would be a cool combo.<br>16Bard/Cot8/WM16. A fighter could get a higher AB, but the CoT nets you better saves, which might be crucial in a dev-crit place.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again
