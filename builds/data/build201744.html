OK, this is my try to make a nice Rogue/Cleric/Assassin.<br>It’s the first build I post, although I have already made several for myself. Sorry if some of the feats or skills are wrongly translated (I have the Spanish version of the game)<br><br>The Drow Slayer of Lolth<br><br>Race: Elf (if Drows can be chosen as a subrace in your server, choose it!!

It would be great for this build(80% concealment!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif"> )but I’m afraid they don’t <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  . In this case, I would take 3 Improved Sneak Attack feats.<br><br>Lolth has sent you to slay those opposing to her implacable will. Drawing upon her sacrilegious might, you cast Resistance, Cat’s Grace, Endurance, Divine Power, Divine Might, and make your short sword an even more fatal weapon by casting Darkfire and Grater Magical Weapon on it. Then you use your dominion of the Strength powers to raise your force and use your ability as an Assassin, or your domain over Treachery (or you read a scroll, don’t forget you have UMD and Spellcraft), to cast Improved Invisibility on yourself. When you spot your enemy, he can’t see you. You attack him, and you leave him half-dead and paralyzed. Even if is not the case, he hardly hits you (high AC and 50% at least of concealment). In one of your attacks, you take his weapon out of his hands, leaving him unarmed. If you like, you can make yourself invisible again and finish his miserable life off. His soul is brought to Lolth’s realm to suffer your beloved goddess’ wraith.<br><br>Any comments or improvements will be welcome. I don't know if something like this has already been posted, sorry. Of course I’m sure this build has lots of disadvantages, and maybe mistakes, buy, hey, that’s your work, not mine! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">

Just gave it a quick glance:  <br><br>1.  Alignment states Lawful/Neutral.  Can't work with Assassin.  Need evil.<br><br>2.  He can't have Epic Dodge or the SC Feats without Improved Evasion.  Right now, he only has Defensive Roll.  You'll have to make adjustments somewhere.<br><br>3.  You could easily drop Dodge and Mobility as they are not prereqs for anything, and won't really add much.<br><br>4.  Unless, you're an Uber Build Guru(like Mith), you might want to test the character in-game or in a leveller first, by the by.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 06/28/05 17:52</span></i></p>

1. A silly mistake. I wanted to write Lawful Evil (what are drows after all?)<br><br>2. Ooops, you're right!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_redface.gif">   I'll have to take 5 more levels of rogue, then... or maybe forget the Epic Dodge and SC feats idea, and take something else instead... Let me think about it.<br><br>3. Dodge and Mobility are useful feats IMO, but you can take Weapon Focus: Short Sword and Toughness instead, for example.<br><br>4. I don't have the game in this computer. And, what the hell is a leveler?? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif"> <br><br>Thank you for your comments, dwarflord.

One other problem you'll run into is you're taking GRT DEX V at level 36 to get your DEX to 30 for the SC requirements. You can't take a Great attribute feat to qualify for another feat on the same level. The boost to your stats from the GRT attribute feat is added <i>after</i> you finish levelling, so it won't qualify you for the SC feat.<br><br>BTW, a leveller is a module you can DL from the neverwinter vault. You use it to make a character, instantly level it up, and test to see if your build works out.<br><br>Your character concept isn't all that bad, you just need to adjust a few things. I'd actually recommend going CLC/Rogue only. Assn doesn't really add anything unless you take a lot of levels in it.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

If you do decide to take assassin levels in the revised version, it might be worth considering an odd numbered ammount of assassin and rogue levels, since this will maximise the sneak damage potential.

Rather than dropping assasin, I'd get more levels in it at the expense of rogue. Also I'd go for the classic multiples of four pre-epic. By taking rogue at lvl 5 you meet the prereq for assassin, after that I suggest going assassin instead of rogue, then taking one more near lvl 20, getting (rogue 4/cleric 8/assassin 4) pre-epic and (rogue 5/cleric 12/assassin 23) final. This should mean<br><ul><br><li>+1 BAB<br></li><li>+5 death attack DC<br></li><li>+1d6 sneak damage<br></li><li>-20 skill points<br></li><li>-1 rogue bonus feat<br></li></ul><br>I may well have made some critical mistake, especially as I'm no good at clerics, but I'm hoping this will be of some use anyway.<br><br>EDIT:<br>Anyway, sneak attack should be 14d6 in the original build, 15d6 with these changes<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By pulse cap on 07/01/05 15:06</span></i></p>

<i>Addendum:</i><br>By increasing assassin to 23 you would also gain another assassin bonus feat.
