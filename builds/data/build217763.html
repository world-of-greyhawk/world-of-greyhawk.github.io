Really nice build...saves apart as you said. Bard song is gonna be quite effective and your melee presence is something. Immune to a bunch of stuff and you've got epic warding and mage armor too. <br>A question: what are the DCs for paralyze and death touch?

Heya Ith.  I keep an eye out for your builds, as I think they are generally pretty well thought-out and solid.  In spite of the fact that apparently there are a number of builds featuring this level balance, I think your build is different enough to still be original and is very cool.  Even though I have always thought that PM builds were pretty lame RP-wise (ooh, look at me---I'm undead!) and also can be rather boring to level, I may give this one a go since it seems to pack more punch than most others of this type and combining RDD and PM seems interesting.  Any chance you could come up with the quick and dirty list of his "defining" abilities/immunities without too much trouble?  The PM list above doesn't tell me much since I don't play them.<br><br>Either way, kudos to you once again.<br>_________________<br>Favorite PW's: Hall of the Worlds, Higher Ground, World of Iniquity.

Right.

I hope not!  That may be true, but I haven't seen that.  That would affect the build.  I still like it, but no greater ruin, my sort of ace in the hole.  And a more or less useless PM feat at 36.  Energy Resistance or something (well, not useless, but I like the idea of unloading greater ruin on a pesky foe).

You could still get Greater Ruin if you found a way to take that 15th PM on Lvl 36, then on Lvl 39 take PM16.<br><br>I find Epic Warding to be the only one worth the feat anyway.

It's a really annonying bonus feat if you aren't already a 9th level caster.  I usaully slip in Improved Combat Casting, but seeing as you don't have the concentration or the Combat Casting, that is moot. You wouldn't qualify for Auto spells feats, or ESP or ESF.  Energy Resistance it is for you (tip: don't choose fire <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> ).

I didn't <i>necessarily</i> say that.

I happen to like, no make that LOVE devcrit. Saying it is cheese or whatever you want to say it is, will be said laying on your back, at the feet of this AWESOME warrior. Its a game of give and take; you cant have it all. But this build, IMHO, with both devcrit AND immunity to devcrit, will still be standing when the version with stil spell and blind fight (and IKD or whatever else you traded devcrit for) is in the respawn process.<br><br>It all depends on what you want to do. This build is meant for PVP, and it does that quite well. It is not meant for RP, thus no need for stil spell as the spell most needed here (war cry) can be cast in full, glorious, shining armor. Admittedly, you will need to remove armor/shield PRIOR to heading out to the battlefield, but as I already said, you cant have it all.<br><br>Nice build Ithacan.
