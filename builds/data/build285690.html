“Yer goh teh beh joken meh.” The dwarf said as his beard leapt into flames, “Tha’s teh ‘ird time dis week.” His brother <br><br>looked up from where he was polishing his sword. “Yer shoul’ stop getten’ so drunk brudder, all dat drinkin’ ain’t nay good <br><br>fer yer beard.” The dwarf stood up in outrage. “Wha’ dis foolishness yer be sayin’?!

Unless you are playing on a world that nerfed dev crit, I would highly suggest taking it.  You meat all of the prerequisites for Overwhelming crit.  It would just make sense.  Dropping two Greater Strength in exchange for dev crit would still be a great trade off.<br><br>If you drop DwD by one level and take Sor up to 8th, you'd open up your 4th level spells.  You would be taking a small HP hit and loose one use of Defensive Stance, but you'd be gaining 4th level spells.  Elemental Shield, Improved Invis, Stone Skin, Minor Globe of Invulnerability...<br><br>I think it might be worth it.<br><br><br>A 13th level Dwd only gets 6/- DR.  You need 14 for 9/-.<br>Since you don't really gain that much between 10 DwD and 13 DwD, you might want to take RDD up to 22 Sor up to 8 and DwD to 10.  That would net you another D10 on your breath, 4th level spells, and you'd gain another bonus RDD epic feat.<br><br>If you want to shoot for 9/- DR, then drop Sor down to 6 and raise DwD to 14.<br><br>I like the build.  Seems like it would smack some heads and toast some bottoms.

I do actually have a few, if they are the best ones is something I won't think too much of...<br><br>Its a real shame you can't make the full APR with this class spread, bard would (as always) be better but its the usual alignement shift story...<br><br>You end on 17 Con and 37 Str, two odd values... why? Odd numbers add nothing, and defensive stance adds even numbers only: thus take the last point into Con for another 40 hps and no loss in AB and damage.<br><br>Personally I see no reason to go beyond 10 RDD levels... taking sorc 7/RDD 10/ DwD 23 gives you 15/- DR and more defensive stace a day for the loss of 2 AC. I'd actually suggest taking sorc 8/RDD 10/ DwD 22. Considering you don't want to stick with the flaming RDD thing and value the breath weapon too much, do know that it has a meager 21 save DC, meaning pretty much every single build will make that save almost every time, lowest possible save is 15 on lv 40, and that needs a roll of 6 to succeed.<br><br>Do a little long term planning, and swap IKD and cleave/ great cleave, starting with an int of 12 and Cha of 12, you now have access to one 4th level spell (Imp. invis). This means you'll have to take the last (8th) sorc level after the 10th RDD level, but I'd say its worth it.<br><br>The postponing of IKD is well worth its time in cleave, or at least I feel so, you don't even lose any skillpoints. (I don't mean drop cleave, just swap the time you take cleave and IKD)<br><br>Taking 21 tumble is clever, this allows you to dodge all AAOs while moving even with full plate since you'll have 14 active.<br><br>One last thing: Imp. power attack is not something I'd take with a 3 APR build, great cleave is so neat for a powersmasher like this one, and the added attacks is love to the world.<br><br>I think thats all I have to say on this one. I'll finish by saying that even if I never thought of anything like this, I like it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>EDIT: Bromuim made some of my points, however being the DwD fan I am I suggested going the other route.<br>EDIT2: After looking at the other two builds you linked I guess my post was rather pointless since that would be close to a copy of theirs... I admire your individuality, even if it may not be the most powerful split.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cerolill on 10/25/07 14:42</span></i></p>

Bromium - Yeah, the world I normally play on is Dev-critless, I was consideing going with Overwhelming crit, I'm not actually sure what caused me to change my mind, probably my computer crashing multiple times till I forgot about that plan.<br><br>After I posted this character I was playing around with trying to get another level of sorc for 4th level spells, I also worked out a way to get another spell for level 3, that'd be Haste, Keen and GMW. That'd be useful...<br><br>I couldn't really see the point of another RDD bonus feat, I only chose Epic Toughness because as an RDD I'm immune to Fire and 5 more resist against (Insert an element here) didn't seem that much, and 20 more HP is a slightly better chance of not getting killed as quickly.<br><br>I'll look into your leveling to get 9/- DR, I like DR. ^.^<br><br>Cerolill - The lack of 1 BAB to get 4 APR for this guy really made me cry, stupid allignment shift needed for bard.<br><br>Hmm... Good idea about the Con, HP is always good. ^.^<br><br>I was looking through this last night after I posted, I was thinking that I left cleave a bit late...<br><br>And also 21 Tumble is +4 AC or something, right? (And with that I blow away any cover that I might know what I'm talking about...) I remember someone telling me that a while back, I thought it'd be a good thing to have.<br><br>Good point on the Imp. Power attack, if I true strike then kill someone it'll stil hurt just as much aye? ^.^<br><br><br>EDIT: Bromuim made some of my points, however being the DwD fan I am I suggested going the other route.<br>EDIT2: After looking at the other two builds you linked I guess my post was rather pointless since that would be close to a copy of theirs... I admire your individuality, even if it may not be the most powerful split. <br><br>I started off thinking along the lines of those builds, then I looked and changed my ideas not wanting to be too close to them and seem ike I was just stealing thier idea.<br><br>One last thing, I see someone changed the links to say "Click here"... Can someone please explain how to do it to me so someone else doesn't have to later?<br><br>Thanks guys,<br>           Bread<br><br>Edit - 'Good cleave a bit late'?

Tumble gives +1 AC fo every 5 points taken, so you gain +4 AC from 20 tumble, 21 gives no more AC but it gives you the tumble needed in full plate to avoid all AOOs while moving on combat.<br><br>Thise site is the love of all non-geek builders: <a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page</a><br><br>If you want more DR you can drop RDD to 18, take 14 DwD and 8 sorc, with Abilies<br><br>STR: 16 (36)<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 15 (18)<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 12 (14)<br>CHA: 12 (14)<br><br>All points but one into Str, one to Con.<br>- 4th level spells, 9/- DR, 7 def stance a day.<br>- 1 NAC loss, d10 breath loss.<br><br>Here you have to take IKD far into epic levels, same time as you have cleave now, but get cleave early.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cerolill on 10/26/07 09:48</span></i></p>

Yeah, actually you wrote DR 9/- even though you only get 6 with that spread.<br><br>Why do you take so much RDD? your epic levels would work better as Dwarven Defender IMO, a lot of more DR and about the same amount of bonus feats as well, you're not even gaining anything from RDD 20.<br><br>Bard/DWD/RDD is not good as a new build, that build has been made already several times.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

I think more RDD was taken for flavor.  I'm all for flavor and not so much about being a clone of other builds.
