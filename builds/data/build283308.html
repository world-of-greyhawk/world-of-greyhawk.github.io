Errm... I think Cleave is needed for Great Cleave which is in turn needed for Overwhelming Critical? That's what my little manual of doom says anyway.

Two Bladed Sword has a better Crit range than a Double Axe.  The Double Axe does have a better Crit Multiplier.  So it's up to the user to get more crits or get better crits.<br><br>Cleave &amp; Great Cleave are (as stated previously) needed for Overwhelming Crit, but they are also very good feats to have in general.  Toughness only grants 40 HPs.  A Good Con boosting item and Spell can make up for that.<br><br>Improved Invis or Darkness+ultravision would help this guy alot.<br><br>This guy is mainly a fighter for damage dealing, his magic only enhances that aspect and maybe debuffs his ennemy before engagine in battle.<br><br>The level 9 spell slot is to be able to cast level 8 spells while in armor (still spell).

Why not start with 18 STR? Then you could raise your starting INT to 14 and your starting CON to 10. Switch out 2 of your INT boosts (either feats or ability raises or one of each) for STR boosts. Same final result, but 40 more HPs, more skill points, and +1 on your Fort saves.<br><br>*edit* In fact, if you switch your first two INT boosts to STR, you'll be at exactly the same point in your build at level 8 as you would the way you level it now (STR 20 and INT 14). But you'll have more HPs.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 09/18/07 20:58</span></i></p>

Some thoughts on the WIZ levels taken, especially so late in the build: you most likely will be dispelled extremely easily (you're getting level 1 WIZ spells at character level 22. Want to guess what happens to your buffs when you run into a caster?)<br><br>As well, you most likely won't be dispelling anything at all, since the critters (caster types) you're going to meet when you get even the lowest level Dispel Magic spell are going to be equivalent to level 26 or thereabouts = undispellable. By level 40 you'll have Mord's, but that's a long time to wait. You won't even have the ability to use scrolls until level 22.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of the spellsword and I really like the looks and concept of this build. Unfortunately, I'd have to guess that in practice, this guy's not going to be nearly as sweet as he looks on paper.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

It is true that this build can be dispelled.  His main focus IS melee of course, so he was never meant to be the best mage out there.  I view his tactic as (pre-buff before combat, rush up 1/2 way, throw one offensive (dispel?) spell and then go slice and dice.<br><br>The opposing force would indeed throw a dispell first... but that would be their one action before then eat blade.<br><br>Of course there is nothing stoping a TIME STOP + Mord + IGMS to the face...<br><br>There's only so much you can do vs a TIME STOP mage.<br><br>Can't dispel Keen, flame Blade, True Strike.<br><br>His one spell prior to going into melee is a "best case" scenario where you actually get the chance to throw one off before clashing blades.<br><br>===<br><br>Shuffling STR and INT looks good.  I'll put that into the spreadsheet and see how it pans out.

Good point , Bromium. I tend to forget the default game settings can't dispel your weapon buffs (where I play on-line, they do get dispelled). You can definitely play it the way you envision. I was just pointing out some of the possible limitations. I still like the build though.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

By lowering initial STR to 18 (vs 20) I was able to add 2 to INT and 2 to CON.  My end build still had the same STR and INT, but also netted 10 more skill points and 40 more HPs.<br><br>*golf clap to Cin*

My first question is why Half-Orc? Going Human allows you another feat, giving you no negative start to your INT and more skills as a result.<br><br>Taking WM and every feat bar Dev Crit along its pre-req route is always a tough ask, particularly when you try to make it a caster too. Something should really have to give here, but I do admire your intentions.<br><br>Personally I would forego Improved Combat Casting, Great Cleave and Overwhelming Critical in favour of Extend Spell and possibly two Great Strengths or Epic Energy Resist Fire and Acid<br><br>If you drop two Wiz levels to 15, meaning you keep the bonus feat and up to 8th level spells then you can slip in another two fighter levels, gaining you hp and an extra feat<br><br>Going Fighter 18, Wiz 15, WM 7 with starting stats of STR 16, DEX 15, CON 14, WIS 8, INT 14 &amp; CHA 8 would net you an increase of 172 HP, 57 skill points, allowing you to max Concentration &amp; Heal, drop a point into Disable Trap, Search and Open Lock, while keeping Spellcraft to 41 (45), gives you a further 13 points to throw around.<br>You can also fit in Toughness pre-epic and PA &amp; Cleave earlier on. Overall though your feats available remain the same throughout otherwise.<br><br>You could take Fighter levels at 21st, 27th, 32nd, 37th and 40th thereby maximizing your discipline ranks throughout its epic life and also at the final level-up.<br><br>Ideas really for you.

Yes, it's no different than a halfling/elf getting Epic Dodge at level 21.  Start the half-orc with a 20 Strength, have Str25 by Level20, take an even Fighter level at Level 21, and get both Overwhelming and Dev Crit in one fell swoop.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

It's important to remember that with ANY build posted to the forums, a person should should or could be inspired by them and make their own creation that suits their world/module.  There are not many 1/2 Orc casters out there.  Perhaps this version would therefor be more inclined to an RP world where dev crit was removed.

It's not. The manual is wrong on that account. All you need for Dev Crit is Power Attack, Cleave, Great Cleave, Improved Critical, Overwhelming Critical, and 25+ STR.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
