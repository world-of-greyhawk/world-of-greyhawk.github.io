My favorite build is a non-elite but highly flexible Fighter/Rogue/Weaponmaster.<br><br>I call it the Epic Marauder and it is a Human only build due to heavy reliance on both early feats and skill pts.<br><br>Starting attributes:<br><br>Str - 17<br>Dex - 13<br>Con - 14<br>Int - 14<br>Wis - 8<br>Cha - 8<br><br>L1 - Fighter 1, Luck of Heros, Dodge, Expertise, Discipline +4, Heal +4, save extra pts.<br>L2 - Fighter 2, Mobility, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L3 - Fighter 3, Spring Attack, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L4 - Fighter 4, Str to 18, Weapon Focus, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L5 - Fighter 5, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L6 - Fighter 6, Weapon Specialization, Whirlwind Attack, Disc +1, Heal +1, Intimidate +4.<br>L7 - Weaponmaster 1, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L8 - Weaponmaster 2, Str to 19, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L9 - Weaponmaster 3, Improved Critical, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L10- Weaponmaster 4, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L11- Weaponmaster 5, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L12- Weaponmaster 6, Str to 20, Iron Will, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L13- Weaponmaster 7, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L14- Rogue 1, Tumble +17, Use Magic Device +17, Spellcraft +5 (10 skill pts.)<br>L15- Rogue 2, Toughness, Tumble +1, UMD +1, Spellcraft +4 (8 skill pts.)<br>L16- Rogue 3, Str to 21, Tumble +1, UMD +1, Spellcraft +1 (2 skill pts).<br>L17- Rogue 4, Tumble +1, UMD +1.<br>L18- Rogue 5, Open Feat, Tumble +1, UMD +1.<br>L19- Rogue 6, Tumble +1, UMD +1.<br>L20- Rogue 7, Str to 22, Tumble +1, UMD +1.<br>L21- Fighter 7, Great Strength I (23), Disc +8, Heal +8.<br>L22- Fighter 8, Epic Weapon Focus, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L23- Fighter 9, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L24- Fighter 10, Str to 24, G Str II (25), Epic Weapon Specialization, Disc +1, Heal +1<br>L25- Fighter 11, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L26- Fighter 12, Epic Prowess, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L27- Rogue 8, G Str III (26), Tumble +7, UMD +7.<br>L28- Rogue 9, Str to 27, Tumble +1, UMD +1, Spellcraft +5 (10 skill pts.)<br>L29- Fighter 13, Disc +3, Heal +3.<br>L30- Fighter 14, G Str IV (28), Epic Armor, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L31- Fighter 15, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L32- Fighter 16 Str to 29, Open Fighter Feat, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L33- Rogue 10, Improved Evasion (Rogue feat), G Str V (30), Tumble +5, UMD +5.<br>L34- Rogue 11, Tumble +1, UMD +1.<br>L35- Fighter 17, Disc +3, Heal +3.<br>L36- Fighter 18, Str to 31, G Str VI (32), Open Fighter Feat, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L37- Fighter 19, Disc +1, Heal +1.<br>L38- Rogue 12, Tumble +4, UMD +4.<br>L39- Rogue 13, Slippery Mind (Rogue Feat), G Str VII (33), Tumble +1, UMD +1.<br>L40- Fighter 20, Str to 34, Open Fighter Feat, Disc +3, Heal +3.<br><br>The build has one of two weapons in mind: Great Sword or Scythe. If you choose to go Scythe then you basically sacrifice the Luck of Heros feat at L1 in exchange for Exotic Weaponry.<br><br>There is no attempt in the build to go for Overwhelming and Devastating Critical although the open feats 18, 32, 36 and 40, along with the option to not take Luck of Heros or Iron Will leave that option wide open. I actually use a Scythe in my build and chose to go for Called Shot, Knockdown and Improved Knockdown instead. These give me real options against critical immune bosses. I also chose to go with Epic Will to make me less easy pickings for casters.<br><br>There are a lot of unallocated skill points in the build also. You can use these for anything you want to. I chose to emphasize the Rogue skills with them, however you could max Concentration, or in the mods that favor it even become a master weaponcrafter.<br><br>Between the two-handed weapon, weaponmaster focus, very high strength and sneak attack the damage this build puts out is formidable. One of the reasons I chose not to go for Devastating Critical is that nothing that I can hit well stands up for more than a few rounds anyway. The stuff I can't hit is probably going to kill me before I get a 1 in 400 critical to drop it anyway, even assuming that it is not crit immune, which most of those targets are.<br><br>Finally, this build buffs as well as any Mage with its 40+ Use Magic Device skill. Get a couple of Wizard spellbooks and you are good to go. My Scythe Marauder buffs Greater Stoneskin, Elemental buffs and all of his stats and uses Improved Invisibility and Displacement when he attacks. Combined with sneak attack and 400 pt critical hits this makes him extremely nasty in the first 10 seconds of a battle.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/26/08 07:44</span></i></p>
