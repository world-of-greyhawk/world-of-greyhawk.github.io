You'll want to change that a lot.  For example, change starting strength to 14, starting dexterity to 16 and starting wisdom to 16.  You also really delay on some stuff...and you should go fighter 5 for epic weapon specialization.  I'll rework this later when I have more time to show you what I mean.
