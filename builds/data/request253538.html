I'm looking for a good dragon form build that includes at least 10 levels of either fighter or rogue, preferably fighter. This is necessary because my server, Shadow Mountain, has a rebirth system where at level 40 you can delevel to 1 and work your way back up, with a special extra power. The best powers are granted by having 10 levels or either fighter or rogue because they grant crit immunity for 300 sec 2x/day in addition to other buffs.<br><br>I'm thinking something in the general range of Druid 28/Ftr 10/Monk 2. Ideas?<br><br>Rebirthing can be done twice, and so on my second incarnation I'll probably go for 10 levels of wizard in addition to DF. The third and last build will be the best dragon form build I can find. I'm hoping it might be able to stand up to some really strong Ftr/Bard/RDD builds that PVP me a lot <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   Dev crit is not disabled here so it's tough without that crit immune power. Suggestions other than DF build would be welcome.<br><br>Edit: it should be playable from about level 20 on, the preepic levels are a breeze since you get to carry your equipment over on rebirth - lvl 40 items on lvl 1 chars is pretty fun! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By obsidian tower on 09/22/06 18:56</span></i></p>

Even if such a build is not out there, any general or specific pointers on dragon builds would be appreciated. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Which world are you playing on?<br><br>And for your build-request ... if you don't yet have more specific ideas, let the results of the build-search at <a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/search/builds.htm" target="_blank">http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/search/builds.htm</a> inspire you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

Thanks for the response! I play on the Shadow Mountain PW. They use an item socketing system, so everyone has custom-built items, which means that everyone has +12 on relevant stats, saving throws often in the 40's, regen in the 30's or 40's, several types of elemental damage, etc.<br><br>I have been searching pulse cap's engine quite a lot, actually. Just trying to get some pointers on the nuances of dragon form, which I've gathered is a pretty complicated thing due to feats that may or may not work in DF, items that do or don't transfer, etc.

Feats that work:<br>Epic Prowess<br>Improved Critical (Unarmed)<br><br>Feats that Don't work:<br>Weapon Focus (Unarmed)<br>Epic Weapon Focus (Unarmed)<br>Devastating Critical (Unarmed)<br><br>Item properties that merge:<br>Armor, Shield, Helmet<br><br>That's all that comes to mind at the moment, but if you are looking for pointers on how to build dragons, look through the indexed list of builds (different from the search engine) and scroll down to everything built by Kail Pendragon, then browse through those.  I'm pretty sure there will be all the pointers you need in there.<br><br>Off the top of my head, I might shoot for something like a halfling Druid 15/ Monk 15/ Rogue 10, or human Druid 15/ Rogue 19/ Monk 6 if you don't mind an XP penalty.  Also, since you'll have to play it up from level 1, I'd tend to discourage anything that takes only a single level of Monk at or near 40.<br><br>Have fun!<br>_________________<br>(I enjoy writing parenthetically (a lot)).
