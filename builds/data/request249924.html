Hey there,<br><br>I am trying hard to build a high CHA build that has a strong melee presence and uses the divine might and shield feats.

You need to have turn undead to use divine might and divine shield, so only clerics, paladins and blackguards can use the feats.  I think a pally/bard/RDD (if you can manage the alignment switch) or pally/sorc/RDD will be the best for your purposes.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

If you really mean Divine Damage, Paladin/CoT30/Monk will be the real deal.

Well, it would work best if you wanted a Smiter, but since you didn't specify if that was to your liking: Paladin/Bard/RDD is really good if the alingment shift isn't a factor. Substitute Bard for Sorc if you can't manage the alignment issue.

I really really got excited about the divine might with like 36 charisma!!  Then you get into it and you notice a problem...  low ab.  A paladin sorc rdd  IF you are goin high cha is a great thing for the save bonus alone (not quite like a pal/cot with high cha  but what ever).   Since you DIDNT want a SMITER, I would suggest taking your cha to 20 at the most.  This would leave you with 32 (+11) with full cha buff.  I know it isnt high, but if you take a scrim with nice range, you can crit it to 22... hmm.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/08/06 16:20:00 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I think avado answered your question like no other could... </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Thanks all for the answers.<br><br>Thought about smiting but its use is limited, only vs evil/good and a max of 3 uses a day. Damage output is nice though...<br><br>Seems a waste indeed to get cha up high, perhaps 20 will suffice and invest everything else in ab, like the previous poster suggests.<br><br>Still not sure on what i will build though, but leaning towards cleric(pally)/bard/rdd.<br>_________________<br>Everything`s been done, everything`s been said so why bother

Much of this depends on the kinds of ACs you'll be facing.  Is this a low magic environment?  If so, you can easily get a Str20/Chr26 with a handful of Great Smites, Extra Smiting, undispellable buffs, Evasion, Tumble, UMD, and 36 levels of Pally/CoT for some massive Great Smite Damage and Lay on Hands.  And no alignment shifts or xp penalties.  If interested, let me know, I can PM you the details.  I'm playing just such a character on my PW and I'm on cruise control through the abounding villainy.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
