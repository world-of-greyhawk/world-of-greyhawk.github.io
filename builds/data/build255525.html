So, it's my first build, I won't feel bad if you point out flaws or whatnot with it.  This class combination has never been done before, at least according to pulse cap's search engine.  I saw a couple dragon builds recently, and I thought it might be nice to have dragon with Epic Dodge.  Ideally, combat should consist of making use of Stunning Fists and/or Knockdowns to knock you opponent prone/stunned and then tear into them with your SA dice.<br><br>Claw 'Em When They're Down – Rogue(16), Druid(14), Champion of Torm(10)<br>Race: Halfling / Alignment: Any Non-Evil Neutral<br><br>I.

Seeing strength 6 and con 8 makes me cringe, and I think your early levels are going to be rough, but eventually shapeshifting will make it a lot more bearable and fitting both dragon shape and epic dodge into the build isn't easy, so I can't complain too hard.<br><br>I'd drop weapon focus (shortsword) for extend spell, or weapon focus (sling) to capitalize on your use of zen archery and the halfling ranged AB bonus.

Fixed some stats. You forgot Dragon Claws (+6 AB) and Huge size (-2 AB) in the AB calculations. Also, there's no bonus to AB when attempting a KD vs smaller sized targets, not anymore ('twas fixed a looong time ago). What happens is that the target gets a modifier to his Discipline check according to the size difference between attacker and target.<br><br>BTW, capping AB means getting your hands on clerical scrolls for dragon shape, or casting true strike from scroll, shapeshifting and get one single attack off at capped AB (not really an option).<br><br>Personally, I don't build non-Monk Dragons. In this case, I think that the big loss in AC from not having monk hurts ED, especially since there aren't many ways to raise your AC: +5 Natural from Barkskin and let's add a +5 Deflection from Armor/Scrolls/what-not. Anyhow, PvM you should have no problem in the end. Starting out will be painful with those stats. Not much can be done about them though, given what you're aiming to.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?

So you should, in theory, experience a slight <i>increase</i> in the number of attacks you hit with, even though you're making fewer attacks per round.

Oh, I guess it's worth noting you can lose 80 Skill points and add a point to Dex, freeing up a feat to be used on Epic Prowess or Armor Skin if you really want it.
