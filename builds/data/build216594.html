There are quite a few of these builds around, each with a slightly different focus. Maybe not the most original, but this one is focused around the Cleric's spellset and <i>not getting dispelled</i> as well as having OK melee stats (OK AB, high AC) which when buffed can get very, very high; A frontliner who can act decently as a healer/buffer.<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: any non-lawful<br><br><b>Playable 1-40 PvM</b><br><br>Stats:<br>STR: 14(30)<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 14(16)<br>INT: 14(16)<br>WIS: 16(22)<br>CHA: 8(10)<br><br>01: Cleric(1): Extend Spell, Weapon Proficiency Martial, Domain War, Domain Trickery<br>02: Cleric(2)<br>03: Cleric(3): Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>04: Cleric(4): WIS+1, (WIS=17)<br>05: Cleric(5)<br>06: Cleric(6): Empower Spell<br>07: Cleric(7)<br>08: Cleric(8): WIS+1, (WIS=18)<br>09: Cleric(9): Blind Fight<br>10: Cleric(10)<br>11: Cleric(11)<br>12: Cleric(12): WIS+1, Improved Critical: Greatsword, (WIS=19)<br>13: Cleric(13)<br>14: Cleric(14)<br>15: Cleric(15): Knockdown<br>16: Cleric(16): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br>17: Cleric(17)<br>18: Cleric(18): Still Spell<br>19: Cleric(19)<br>20: Cleric(20): STR+1, (STR=15)<br><br>NOTE: Trueseeing won't help when fighting concealed opponents anymore since one of the recent patches which is why Blind Fight was included.<br><br>21: Bard(1): Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>22: Red Dragon Disciple(1)<br>23: Red Dragon Disciple(2): (STR=17)<br>24: Red Dragon Disciple(3): STR+1, Improved Knockdown, (STR=18)<br>25: Red Dragon Disciple(4): (STR=20)<br>26: Red Dragon Disciple(5)<br>27: Bard(2): Toughness<br>28: Red Dragon Disciple(6): STR+1, (STR=21)<br>29: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=16)<br>30: Red Dragon Disciple(8): Epic Prowess<br>31: Red Dragon Disciple(9): (INT=16)<br>32: Bard(3): STR+1, (STR=22)<br>33: Red Dragon Disciple(10): Armor Skin, RDD: (Darkvision), (STR=26), (CHA=10)<br>34: Cleric(21)<br>35: Cleric(22)<br>36: Cleric(23): STR+1, Great Strength I, Great Wisdom I, (STR=28), (WIS=21)<br>37: Cleric(24)<br>38: Cleric(25)<br>39: Cleric(26): Great Strength II, Great Wisdom II, (STR=29), (WIS=22)<br>40: Bard(4): STR+1, (STR=30)<br><br>Max HP: 476<br>BAB: 25<br>AB (naked, greatsword): 39<br>AC (naked/full plate): 32<br><br>Saves:<br>Fort: 25<br>Ref: 16<br>Will: 28<br><br>+9 vs. spells<br><br>Skills (232 skillpoints):<br>Concentration: 43(46)<br>Spellcraft: 43(45)<br>Discipline: 43(53)<br>Tumble: 40(40)<br>Taunt: 43(43)<br>Lore: 8(15)<br>Perform: 9(9)<br><br>4 extra<br><br>Mum's being very annoying trying to detroy my self-esteem so can't add more here right now but with buffs, can reach or nearly reach max buffed AB (65) and have very good AC as well as do some healing etc. I guess which feats are taken can be tightened.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

Why postpone Bard and RDD until Epic levels? Is it strictly to develop as a Cleric before watering down the build with multiclassing?<br><br>Both Bard and RDD bring great elements that could help the character develop (Tumble, RDD Stat Bonuses, Bard Song, UMD come to mind).<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban.<br><br>PS - Naughty mum!

Getting the RDD bonuses early can be a big help, but in order to avoid losing AB you'd have to take all the classes in multiples of 4... meaning you'd either lose 1 or 2 BAB or no bard levels would be left over for epic level skill dumps.<br><br>That said I'd probably accept losing a point of AB to get something like cleric 15/bard 1/RDD 4 at level 20... but I think it really evens out in the end.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Build only gets level 3 bardsong so no big deal there. You can live with being only Cleric until epic - they have awesome buffs though I do the temptation is there to get tumble ealier. It's quite a simple build but it can be quite the monster fully buffed.<br><br>39 Base AB:<br>----------<br>+5 Greater Magic Weapon<br>+5 Divine Power (adds another attack at full AB too)<br>+1 Bless<br>+1 Aid<br>+2 Battletide<br><br>+3 Min. from Empowered Bull's STR with a roll of 3 and Aura of Vitality<br><br>= 56 AB<br><br>----------<br>To above, add +5 from one of these:<br><br>+5 Divine Favor<br>+6(?) War Domain AB Bonus<br>+1 Bard Song<br><br>= 62 (AB from enchantment maxed)<br><br>Adding these shorter buffs to the longer-lasting ones will make you hit the AB of 62 minimum from 20 enchantment bonus and 3 from +7 to STR. I'm not sure if the War Domain power is capped.<br><br>32 AC in full-plate:<br>----------<br>+1 Cat's Grace<br>+5 Shield of Faith<br>+5 Magic Vestment<br>+4 Undeath's Eternal Foe(??)<br><br>= 47<br><br>Undeaths stacks? You could get it quite a lot higher then if you wanna waste slots on it.<br><br>Bummer, thought it'd get higher *sigh*. Maybe get Imp. Expertise somewhere; you could fight in it and maintain good AB.<br><br>Extra Damage:<br>+15 base STR bonus for a 2-hander<br>+1 min. roll empowered Bull's STR<br>+2 Aura of Vitality STR Bonus <br>+5 Greater Magic Weapon<br>+1 Bless<br>+2 Battletide<br><br>+1d6 +10 Darkfire<br>= +37 damage min added to weapon base<br><br>+5 Divine Favor<br>+6(?)

pity about your weapon type as it prohibits you taking a shield and getting your ac even higher, with another cast of magic vestment. Potentially another 8 pointd if using a tower shield...

Weapon Type isn't set - it takes martial at level 1 so you could take any weapon which the classes allow and martial allow you to use that you want. If I were building this, it'd be a toss-up, for me, between a heavy flail (whee!), scim or GS. If you wanted scim - go ahead though you'd lose some base STR damage though the crits would probably more than make up for it, and gain that AC in return.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

btw the Undeaths do stack, but only grant 4 Dodge AC each time. Obviously this hits a cap at some point, and I think it is 20, which also includes item bonuses in this area.<br><br>Also with your attack roll, I think you missed the benefits of Prayer (and to damage as well). The only trouble is your max buffed AB is capped at 20 above your base, in this case at 59, despite what your character sheet says. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br>still more spells to go round, when the rest begin to wear off eh!

Can't you also get another +6 to AB on top of that from a +12 STR bonus on your natural STR? Then it's 65 max.<br><br>Also, if I were to go for more power, I'd probably leave bard level at 3 and take one more Cleric so Mords has less chance of dispelling.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

Yes, the +6 AB from the max-boosted STR will stack, so the maximum AB would be +65 with the build.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...
