When I did this one, I made a mistake.  This character would not be able to get lasting impression.  Just about any combat or defensive feat would be fine though.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Yar Stardawg on 06/08/04 20:37</span></i></p>

I have a build that I am using on a PW that is very close to this.  I end up with 15bard/15cot/10rdd.  I take as many cot's pre epic to get attacks.  My PW does not allow Dev Crit, so I went with a bigger weapon, bastard sword.  The downside is that I lose the lvl 16 bard song benefits, and then the extra hp/skill points after 16.  In turn that affects the curse song, but I think the extra feats and extra attack bonus is worth it.  Otherwise it is pretty much exactly the same.

I have been playing this character on the PW where I am a regular (Forgotten Worlds Dragon Mountain <a href="http://www.rpgmods.net/forum/" target="_blank">http://www.rpgmods.net/forum/</a> ) I have made several changes to the initial construction and this looks like the final splits.  I have figured out how to get lasting impression, as well.  I upped concentration a lot because our monsters now taunt due to an improved AI. I am also considering dropping improved expertise (I have an excellent AC already) and taking disarm and improved disarm.  I am lvl 34 now, so will have to make that decision soom<br><br>race-human <br>str-16 <br>dex-10 <br>con-14 <br>wis-8 <br>int-14 <br>chr-14 <br><br>lvl 1-bard-since we have 10 dex and crappy weaps, heavy armor proficiency and martial weapons. 4 skill points in concentration, discipline, lore, perform, taunt, tumble, and UMD <br>lvl 2 bard-skill points in above skills <br>lvl 3 bard-lingering song get it now because you may not be able to later-skill in above <br>lvl 4 bard-skills ditto STR +1 <br>lvl 5 bard-skill ditto (this is the last lore skill point you need) <br>lvl 6 rdd-weapon focus scimitar (not rapier because the bard lvl 3 keen spell only works on slashing weaps) <br>lvl 7 bard-take concentration, disc, perform, taunt,perform, tumble and UMD to 10.. <br>lvl 8 rdd (only rdd skill to up is disc) STR +1 rddStr +2 <br>lvl 9 rdd-expertise <br>lvl 10 rdd rddSTR+2 <br>lvl 11 CoT (only CoT skill to up is disc as well) <br>lvl 12 bard -curse song-STR +1-take concnetration, disc, perform, taunt, tumble and UMD to 15 <br>lvl 13 CoT Improved Crit Scimitar <br>lvl 14 rdd <br>lvl 15 rdd Power Attack rddCON+2? <br>lvl 16 CoT STR +1 <br>lvl 17 bard-take concentration, disc, perform, taunt, tumble and UMD to 20 <br>lvl 18 CoT-Cleave, Great Cleave <br>lvl 19 rdd <br>lvl 20 CoT STR+1 <br><br>At lvl 20, you should be 8 bard/7 RDD/5 CoT with 25 STR and I think 16 con (forget the exact lvl of the con increase for rdd) and 4 attacks per round <br><br>lvl 21 CoT-overwhelm crit, Devastating Crit <br>lvl 22 bard -take concnetration, disc, perform, taunt, tumble and UMD to 25 <br>lvl 23 rdd <br>lvl 24 rdd rddINT+2 epic weapon focus scimitar STR+1 <br>lvl 25 rdd rddCHR+2, rddSTR+4 <br>lvl 26 bard-take concentration,disc, perform, taunt, tumble and UMD to 29 <br>lvl 27 bard-ditto skills+1 knockdown <br>lvl 28 bard STR+1 <br>lvl 29 bard <br>lvl 30 bard improved knockdown <br>lvl 31 bard <br>lvl 32 bard STR +1 <br>lvl 33 CoT only raise discipline Armor Skin <br>lvl 34 CoT epic prowess <br>lvl 35 CoT do not take discipline point <br>lvl 36 bard bard skills to 39 except disc.

Yeah, you should be fime against Crit-immunity. Your STR bonus is +12 and if you get yourself a big weapon of the appropriate type for those critters, you'll be fine.<br><br>I made a very similar build as well (just on paper) that ended Bard 22/RDD 10/CoT 8. This was before I found out you could get LI with only 20 levels of Bard. Looks like a fun character. Kudos!<br>_________________<br>"Well, but you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just<br>'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!"

I know this build's posting is month's old, but I came up with the same character concept a few days ago. I did a search here and found Yar's build and compared it to my own.<br><br>One improvement I found in my build is that pre-epic I used the BA advancement table to my advantage.<br><br>Yar's build at 20: Bard 8/RDD 5/CoT 7<br>My build at 20: Bard 8/RDD 4/CoT 8<br><br>Mine presents a 1 AB improvement at level 20 (that of course carries on through the life/development of the build). Reason being the 5th level of RDD pre-epic does nothing to help the character's AB, but taking CoT in it's place adds 1 AB.<br><br>The fifth level of RDD only gives an AC bonus, so it's nothing that needs to be taken as soon as possible. I think it's a wise move to delay it until epic levels considering the reward you get by taking CoT in place of RDD 5.<br><br>FYI, my development was:<br>5 levels Bard<br>4 levels RDD<br>1 level Bard<br>4 levels CoT<br>1 level Bard<br>2 levels CoT<br>1 level Bard<br>2 levels CoT (Bard 8/RDD 4/CoT <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"> <br>6 levels RDD<br>3 levels Bard<br>1 level CoT<br>9 levels Bard<br>1 level CoT (Bard 20/RDD 10/CoT 10)<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br>Check out the Epic Character Builders Guild<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Test your new builds in this mod:<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/modules/data/1073117317280.shtml" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

I did it the way I did in order to save more CoT feats for Epic lvl.  I sacrifice 1 AB by going 8 bard/7 RDD/5 CoT at lvl 20 vs 8 bard/4 RDD/8 CoT.  In doing so, I gain 2 Epic feats and the ability to take Devastating Crit at lvl 21.  Of course, I end up using several of the epic feats for normal feats, so I do agree that your point has much validity.  <br><br>The other issue is that I wanted to start getting my bard lvls to 16 as soon as I can after getting my charisma to 16 (As I said, I play on a PW.  She was lvled the old fashioned way...time and persistance).  I considered her a bard first...tough as nails melee fighter second. Taking most of the RDD earlier speeds up that process.  <br><br>It all boils down to a matter of preference.  I like her the way I did her.  My wife used her as a template for her own character, but made changes that she liked, and is happy.  You have your own preference.  I have had many friends on my PW say that they used her as a starting point but made this or that change (16 bard/10 rdd/ 14 CoT is the most common it seems...they know not the power of lasting impression...mwahahahaha <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  ...ahem <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">  ...excuse me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  )  I am just glad that I could help.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Yar Stardawg on 02/01/05 16:28</span></i></p>
