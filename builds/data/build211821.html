The other one is a typo, tho. You can easily mix in some Druid levels pre epic, just keep the classes in bulks of 4, f.ex. 8/12. That would probably make him more playable early on. I agree with Christian however on that you don't need 23 monk, since monk has done his job on lvl 18. That gives you 5 levels to spare. Rogue or SD would be a good choice, or fighter to improve damage unarmed. In Dragonform you only have physical damage, and you need to get through DR on your opponents.<br><br>edit: You will lose 1 AC if you don't take mionk all the way to 20, tho. If thats a loss compared to uncanny dodge OR 6 extra damage. <br><br>PS. Your build is really hard to advice, since you keep us starved on info and levelling.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 09/09/05 15:38</span></i></p>

The build takes 17 levels of monk and <b>then</b> 17 levels of druid.  By his 17th level of druid, which is his 34th level overall,  he will meet all the requirements for Dragon Shape.  In fact, this build can actually get Dragon Shape at druid level 16.  It takes druid level 16 at character level 33.  The build starts with WIS 18.  If, as the author says, you take its stat boosts in WIS (which would be +8 by level 32) and "take the great wisdom feats until you hit 30" (+4 from epic levels 21, 24, 27, and 30), you would hit WIS 30 by character level 32, and can take Dragon Shape on his 16th druid level, which he takes at character level 33.<br><br>Steve

Was it changed in one of the recent patches with shifted forms and being unarmed? Last I checked forms like dragon shape had natural weapons that interfered with monk unarmed bonus.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

I think that was changed in 1.65, since now all feats with unarmed(EWF, EWS, Imp crit etc.) applies in forms that use unarmed attacks, at least in Dragonform.

Sorry, the Int is a typo - it should be 10/10. I don't know how I managed to hit 3, but I guess I did!<br><br>And yes taking dragon shape is at the 17th druid level in this case, not the 17th character level.<br><br>First time posting a build and I did it in a bit of haste, sorry for the errors and lack of clarification.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By PfhorAiur on 09/10/05 15:34</span></i></p>
