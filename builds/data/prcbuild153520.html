It can add dex mod to dmg (which is 2 or 3 base depending on how you did original stats), and gets +5 ab on 3 different weapons. It also gets a general +3 ab and +3 dmg, in additional to +2 dmg if wearing a longbow or a rapier. It also has Devastating Critical on the Rapier, the highest crit ranged weapon it has.<br><br>Man at Arms has tumble as a class skill, so final stats of this class wearing generic Full Plate and a Tower Shield are:<br><br>---Melee---<br>AC: 10 + 2 (armor skin) + 2 (man at arms) + 8 (tumble) + 9 (full plate + 1 dex mod) + 3 (tower shield) = 34. 39 with expertise. Hardly shabby considering this is without magic items.<br><br>AB: 30 (base) + 3 (man at arms) + 5 (weapon master) + 8 (str mod) + 1 (focus, for all) + 1 (epic prowess) + 2 (additional focus, some) = 50. Base, without even magical STR boosters. That's pretty damn high.<br><br>Damage varies, but it's pretty nice.<br><br>Overall I think this is a great versatile melee build, who can dish out pain and also recieve it well.<br><br>~ Lock.<br>_________________<br>"Life builds you up just to tear you down." - 3rd Strike

I like the versatility of multiple weapons myself; but I didnt think the various Improved Criticals implied in ManAtArms were actual feats that could be used to qualify you for Overwhelming Crit(Rapier)?  Is this a new feature of the next version of PRC?  That would be nice!<br>_________________<br>Normal kids play rock-paper-scissors.<br>Shifter kids play IronGolem-RustMonster-MindFlayer. . .
