<i>Scouting, Spying and Shooting on behalf of her People (and Robin Hood) PvM (1-40) and PvP</i><br><br><b>LADY MARIAN (“Wildwood Maiden”)</b><br><b>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar (with joint credit to Tattoed Monk)</b><br><br><i>* Credits: I would like to thank Tattoed Monk for working with me tirelessly on this build throughout the entire creation process, from start to finish, in bringing this build and concept to life; as such, TM deserves half the credit for this build – thank you, TM (whose efforts are appreciated, and fully acknowledged) </i><br><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; <br>MARIAN: Courageous, smart, proud Marian is as adventurous a champion of the poor as Robin. Marian must appear to toe the line in Nottingham for the sake of her father, but her toughness belies the pain of lost love: her heart is yet to be unlocked. The years may have eroded Marian's gentleness but they have left untouched her generosity of spirit and keen sense of duty to her people. <br><br>Excerpt from, “Robin Hood (the Series): Characters and Actors” (BBC: UK, 2007) </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --> <br><br>Other Builds:<br>While not the first of her kind in terms of the class combo (there being 6 others, and include some of the very first builds in the guild, which are all cool, but nothing quite like this one (though, as true today as it was way back then: AA+HiPs=Fun!). That said, this build (combo and split) was carefully and specifically selected for RP-purposes—i.e., to represent our shared vision of Lady Marion (or Maid Marian, as she is also know), as this build is part of the Robin Hood series.<br><br>The Concept<br>Lady Marian: a high borne noble woman, the daughter of an Earl, she cared about her people. She was also Robin’s “partner in crime.” Whether they be childhood sweethearts or, as the original tales go, met in the Sherwood, where Lady Marian was passing through, to be stopped by the famous outlaw and his band who demanded of her gold, which only led, on her challenge, to a dual between herself and Robin since she refused to hand over her purse. Impressed by her bold nature and prowess, and she being curious as to what this supposed “good cause” of theirs was (to which Robin said her gold would go), they began to talk. On finding they shared common goals to help her people, who were starving under King John's rule, she knew that she had to help. Despite the real danger and risk to herself (and more importantly to her, her father), she agreed to spy for Robin, thus secretly becoming a member of the “merry men,” obtaining important information from the Sheriff and the royal court, and passing it to Robin. <br><br>It is a tale of intrigue, danger, romance, and adventure, in which Maid Marian plays a starring role: a noble woman, and yet an accomplished archer, a champion of her people and thus also of Robin Hood, who is a dangerous outlaw in the eyes of her peers, and yet in Robin she sees a pure heart and much good; it is the reason why she risks so much, to support Robin and his efforts, to help the poor. Basically, she lives her whole life hiding in plain sight. As a member of the Royal Court she is seen but never suspected of supporting Robin Hood, and when she disguises herself to help him, she is seen but never associated with Maid Marian.<br><br>The Build:<br>Hence, the combo: RP-wise (with elves being associated with royalty during medieval times), and making for a solid archer, too: balancing offense with defense, with nice bard flavor. With very good/high AB and 5 attacks/round (make that 6 hasted), she has good damage output with her bow, and also enjoys a decent melee presence. While not exactly a power house when it comes to melee (low damage being a typical weakness of non-sneak dexers, but which you’ll enhance with magic gear and/or by putting your UMD to good use (all of which, of course, enhances bow damage, too); that said, melee versatility is very nice for an archer to have, especially when combined with stealth/HiPs which she can spam to death (not to mention those special arrow AA abilities, combining w. HiPs i.e. dealing with mobs, which also be just plain fun, too!). Bolstered by decent HPs (over 400 and good for an archer), with improved evasion/very nice reflex, a very nice AC (uncanny dodge), with (early enough) epic dodge, and magic access, too: bard buffs, song, and full UMD (enhancing damage and shoring up will, for e.g.), with a decent enough skill-set (thanks to bard, but which could always be better, so true, so true). As such, she differs from other SD/AA builds, enjoying bow precision and very strong defense, with melee versatility; in short, she's a very solid archer, shooting exceptionally well solo PvM, while picking off enemies on behalf of any party PvP.

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    <br><br>Thanks, Mick! <br><br>And appreciate the 'heads-up' re: haste effects and the latest patch (hmmm, just when things are working like they're supposed to, along comes a patch and ... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">     Ah, so now haste gives extra attack no longer at the highest but, rather at second highest AB? Interesting; as you guys know, I'm not a code person per se, and suppose this should be tested proper, but your word of course is good enough for me (thanks, Mick -- really appreciate that, and let's all take note of that folks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>As to the disc/extra skills option(s), yeah, we puts those in to accomodate different tastes etc., and while disc isn't really necessary on a stealth archer, players might wanna consider training up disc for what its worth to enjoy her sword (kinda essential on a meelee'r we thinks so, too -- as to gimping umd for it, depends on the magic setting of one's world - i.e., in low magic where scrolls, items not exactly be plentiful, doesn't matter so much. But in higher magic settings, totally agreed as to the need/enjoyment of umd (hence, the extra skills route if you want ie disc., and in these settings makes total sense to drop ET for a grtdex, thus no change in AB (bow+sword), but a bunch more skills at the cost of only 20 HPs (yes, while extra HPs be nice, wld. still w. song come in just shy of 400 if you drop ET, so no biggie, especially since she does have HiPs, ED and of course net more skills, incl full retention of UMD <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>Thanks so much again, Mick - and yeah, these stealth snipers = fun! (very much an arcade-style/shoot 'em up feeling does she have, a total blast! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>Also, appreciate your comments re: the story/concept, too. TM is equally responsible for that, not just the build but the story, too (in fact, it was his concept initially, and we ran with it) - so very glad to hear you enjoyed it: thanks so much! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>Series Note/Upcoming:<br>Ah, and now in terms of the series, we've Maid Marian here, who joins Alan A Dale (wildwood minstrel), Will Scarlett (wildwood mercenary), and Robin himself (wildwood warrior), as he was historically, i.e., a plate-wearing/sword wielding knight turned outlaw; that said, for all you fans of the legends of Robin as archer, I've an alternate Robin I'm about to post, in accordance w. the legends.

I tested the AB of extra attacks in my "Dark Moon Agent" build. I found that if you have more than one extra attack, they suffer an AB penalty (Divine power, Flurry, Haste).

Just to clearify Haste and dual-wielding. That's how it is supposed to work. In PnP: Haste gives you another partial-action. Which can be used for either 1 normal attack, movement, etc. And a normal attack does not induce 2 weapon penalties even if you hold a weapon in the off-hand.<br><br>It has worked that way in Nwn as long as I can remember, and long before 1.68. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again
