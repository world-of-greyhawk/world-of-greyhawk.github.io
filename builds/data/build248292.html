Looks good. I would make just a few minor tweaks if I were going to play it, such as moving Assn 9 to Level 21.  You're only delaying Improved Invis by 2 levels, and you're increasing AB by 1.  I would then take Assn 10 at Lvl22 for a tumble dump.<br><br>I would also rearrange your feats pre-epic, so that they fall in this order:<br><br>1. WF, KD<br>3. Dodge<br>6. Mobility<br>9. Blindfighting<br>12. IKD<br>15. Improved Crit<br>18. Toughness<br><br>Also, this guy has a variety of damage sources, including FEs, Strength, Sneak, Traps, Animal Companion, and eventually even Bane.  It might be in this character's interest, depending on environment, to grab Iron Will over Imp. Crit and then Epic Will, which you have penciled in as an option.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Hmm, well, your death attack DC is 30... so it might get to paralize low fort saves opponents, but it is low-ish, so I think you could actually just use Rogue, get Crippling Strike and Improved Evasion or move ESFs to get more Great Strengths on normal feats.<br><br>High STR for a sneaker anyway, this guy kills from the back and front, which is nice, you can IKD or Hide, BoE and all, makes a good deal of damage.<br><br>It's very good, I like it.

Thanks for the feat tip, I'll take it into consideration.<br>Another thing I thought of was to dump assassin to 17 (as you dont get much from lv 18, or an epic feat mayhap..?) and take SD instead. Meaning that lv 35 wil be SD and lv 40 will be assassin 17. This way you still get 9d6 death attack and evasion from the 2nd SD level.<br>But will this still give me the feat at lv 40?<br>And if you somewhere along the road chose iron will, you'll get epic will as a bonus feat at lv 40.<br>Same goes for imp initiative, you'll also get to chose superior at lv 40 as the levels are now.<br><br>As you see most traps and have the freedom of movement spell, I guess it would be better to dump epic reflex and take epic will instead. Not sure how but its supposed to be possible...<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Hmm, well, your death attack DC is 30... so it might get to paralize low fort saves opponents, but it is low-ish, so I think you could actually just use Rogue, get Crippling Strike and Improved Evasion or move ESFs to get more Great Strengths on normal feats.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Well, that is ofcourse fully possible too, there are both benefits with that path and the one I chose, and weaknesses in both.<br>Assassin gets spells and poison saves, along with use poison (as this build has fairly low dex thats needed for strong poisons).

If playing SP you can edit your bic file or apply a special program that automatically maxes your HPs. When playing server vault though, the only way is to get max HPs in game, that is (and I suppose this is what you want to know) <b>when you see the final screen during the lvl up process hit cancel if the HPs you gained are less than the maxed allowed for that lvl</b>. When calculating the maximum HPs for a given lvl add together the class HD (ie: 10 for FTR, paladin, ranger, etc; 8 for cleric, druid, monk, etc; 6 for rogues, bards, etc and so on), the CON modifier and possibly +1 from the toughness feat or +20 for epic toughness. On lvls when you raise CON to an even number or when you get the toughness feat the HPs you gain will be greatly increased since both CON raising and Toughness are retroactive.<br><br>Assassin 17 would lose you a feat (since assassin gets a bonus epic feat at 18th assassin lvl).<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?
