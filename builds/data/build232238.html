AH well and?<br><br>The first is i agree quite the same as mine but the  2 others aren't(2nd is cha based and 3rd is 21 paly and 9 sorc).<br>Mine is i would say a variant of the first : str based but with more ac and pali cannot have great str as a bonus feat(or with more damage )<br>hmm Maybe it doesn't make any difference to post here then can someone move it at the end of first build post ...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By malibu-fr on 03/01/06 15:46</span></i></p>

LOL, the free template for posting builds.<br><br>Um, I don't think those base stats are good, as Bearke said, your HP is low, and that's obviuosly because your CON has a negative modifier and you don't have Toughness (although you have one Epic Toughness, but that's because it's bonus).<br><br>Wait, you use a half orc, but you increase CHA and INT? getting CHA to 13 (most obviously for Divine Shield) costs 2, since half orc has penalty on INT and CHA, so unless you're lowering CHA and INT, don't use a half-orc, it's a waste of essential status.<br><br>So, you can use human for the XP penalty issue, you would lose STR, point given, but HP is at least as important, or moreso. with human you could go:<br><br>STR 16<br>DEX 8<br>CON 12<br>WIS 14<br>INT 12<br>CHA 14<br><br>In fact I might change 2 INT for 2 CON, although depending on skills, might not be very good, I don't think Concentration is so needed for a paladin, and paladin doesn't gets the cool skills anyway, although crossclass would give you spellcraft......<br><br><br>My point is, lose some STR for CON, it will help at the end, and human is better than half-orc if you're using CHA, even though you obviously look to gain high dev crit DC, sometimes it's just not worth 80 HP it for 1 DC more, and for the bonus skill for humans, get Toughness, another 40 HP.<br><br>EDIT: Don't rely on True Strike, it just last too little, but your AB is very good.<br><br>EDIT 2: Ok, I just noticed you didn't even posted your actual HP, I calculated for you (with your current stats), it should be 360 f I'm correct, no melee can stand with that.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/01/06 22:31</span></i></p>
