<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM</b><br><br>I'm trying out a Cleric / Sorcerer build, with 5 levels of Harper Scout in it.  HS really is intriguing to me, and I wanted to give this Prestige Class a try.<br><br>It's more of a scholar per say, and I was going for a Halfling race (so only 1 feat on level 1).<br><br>Abilities:<br><br>STR 13<br>DEX 12<br>CON 10<br>WIS 14<br>INT 12<br>CHA 15<br><br>Build order:<br><br>1-CL1		PwrAtk<br>2-CL2	<br>3-CL3		DivineShield<br>4-CL4		WIS15<br>5-CL5	<br>6-CL6		CombCast<br>7-CL7	<br>8-CL8		CHA16<br>9-CL9		DivinePower<br>10-CL10	<br>11-SO1	<br>12-SO2	Empower,CHA17<br>13-SO3	<br>14-SO4	<br>15-SO5	Alertness<br>16-SO6	CHA18<br>17-SO7	<br>18-SO8	Iron Will<br>19-SO9	<br>20-SO10	WIS16<br>21-HS1	GCHA19,HSCHA=20<br>22-CL11	<br>23-HS2	<br>24-CL12	I.CombCast,WIS17<br>25-HS3	HSCHA=21<br>26-HS4	<br>27-CL13	ExtraTurning<br>28-HS5	<br>29-SO11	<br>30-SO12	Scribe Scroll<br>31-SO13	<br>32-SO14	<br>33-SO15	Craft Wand<br>34-SO16	<br>35-SO17	<br>36-SO18	Brew Potion<br>37-SO19	<br>38-SO20	<br>39-SO21	Epic Mage Armor<br>40-CL14	<br><br>The main issue with leveling are keeping in mind the requirements for Harper Scout:  Disc 4, Lore 6, 4 Search, 8 Pursuade.  Two of the four are cross-class skills which is bad.<br><br>Harper Scout boosts Charisma and Dexterity, both of which I would cast empowered versions from cleric spells So basically something like 4-12 inscrease with only these spells.  You also get 2 charisma boosts because they are taken in epic levels.<br><br>I did a trial test, and the Divine Might / Shield is impressive.  <br><br>Spells galore, maybe not very effective, because there is not much room for spell focus, and penetration spells.<br><br>Anyways, critique at will!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 07/13/05 23:04</span></i></p>

I forgot to add that levels 28-40 every ability increase is to charisma.

It's an interesting build (I like using the HS class), but here's something to consider: you're burning 2 feats and 5 levels in HS (not to mention a bunch of skill points) to get 2 GRT CHA feats and 2 once per day spells that stack with your spells. There are other benefits of the HS which aren't insignificant, but you might be better served to drop HS altogether and take 5 more SOR levels. That will give you 2 SOR bonus feats, which can be used to get the 2 GRT CHA feats you took with HS. I realize you won't get the stacking spells, but you probably don't really need them.<br><br>Failing that, if you're keeping the HS levels, I'd take the last one at level 37 to dump points into Tumble and possibly Discipline.<br><br>You'll also get an XP penalty with this build. Not a real concern, but I thought I'd point it out.<br><br>One other thing is the Craft Wand, Scribe Scroll, and Brew Potion feats are probably overkill. I'd go for only one of the three (either scribe or craft) if any. Probably better to drop all three and pick up either Spell Penetration feats or Spell Focus feats.<br><br>All that being said, remember these suggestions are from more of a powergaming point of view. As your build stands, it looks like a roleplaying build and looks pretty fun from that angle.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
