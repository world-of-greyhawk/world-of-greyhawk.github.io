I'm sure that this build has been posted, I however enjoy adding my own creative swing. Meaning, I gear my characters to styles and classes that best suit me, and not to the overall goal. This character was supposed to have the highest AB possible, through postings on the forums I found that a half-orc would give the greatest result. I hate half-orcs, in NWN... they look stupid, their legs are not proportionate to the rest of their bodies and the heads look like crap. So I decided to go with human, a character that I could perhaps RP, along with being a bit of a munchkin. Anyway this is my version of the Sword Saint, a well rounded character, in my opinion.<br><br><br>Sword Saint<br><br>Human, Any Alignment<br><br>STR: 17 &gt; 34<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 10<br>WIS: 10<br>INT: 13<br>CHA: 10<br>All points go into STR<br><br>Skills:<br>Concertration: 20<br>Discipline: 43<br>Intimidate: 5<br>Listen: 20<br>Spellcraft: 20<br>Spot: 20<br>Tumble: 20<br><br>FIGHTER 10/ WEAPON MASTER 28/ WIZARD 2<br><br>* Can swap out the feat<br><br>Feats:<br>1.Weapon Proficiency Exotic*, Weapon Focus (Katana*), Improved Initiative<br>2.

Any improvements that you have please feel free to add your impute. I'd like to keep this guy human and using a katana. Though anyone else making him do whatever.<br>_________________<br>Cheers<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 20:05</span></i></p>
