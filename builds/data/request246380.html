Recently, I've been playing on a persistant world.  I've been looking for a strong melee or ranged build for the game. (A battle cleric might also be fun.)<br><br>-Level 30 is the maximum.<br>-Low-Enchantment World (Most are &lt; +10)<br>-HiPS nerfed: Shadowdancer recieves at L6<br>-Imbue Arrow: Max 1d6 (choosable) extra damage<br><br>This build should be functioning by level 10, but of course aimed at the max of level 30.  I would like them to be a big damage dealer, while simultaneously avoiding or dissipating most incoming attacks (Basically, high AC).  Also note that I enjoy having a large number of attacks per round.<br><br>Thanks for your help!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By RugganDothtar on 07/10/06 03:16</span></i></p>

You want APR? Monk/Druid/CoT, Monk/Druid/Paladin or Monk/Druid/Cleric (the last two can get Divine Might and Divine Shield with a good CHA) is what you want. Shifted melee, with 7 APR unhasted (Paladin or CoT, Cleric while in Divine Power), strong stuff, very nice for low magical environments, with good long-term buffs and some offensive spells, might not want to try dragon though... <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "244978", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click here</a> it's a level 40 though... but I think it could give you an idea of that class combination.<br><br>Now then, it would be regularly nice with that magical level, but probably something else could be stronger...<br><br>I will try to persuade you to use a Dwarven Defender (because it's a very powerful class, and the last requesters threw away my ideas). In <b>any</b> low magical environment, a Dwarven Defender's DR counts strongly, for example, the easy playable way is a Fighter/CoT/DD, probably a Fighter 7 / CoT 3 / Dwarven Defender 10 pre-epic spread, ending Fighter 8 / CoT 4 / Dwarven Defender 18, with EDR III that's a DR of 21/-, which will beat out most stuff with low magical weapons, I'd suggest a double-weapon... and show my build: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "13568", "23072", "236843", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>click here</a> heh heh, but will also work with any other weapon... I'm darn sure it's strong and very playable.<br><br>Other options I can think of right now, since you say the environment is low (medium I'd say though with +10 weapons) is, of course, the Cleric meleer... but well...<br><br>Er, you can make a Weapon Master, probably not a Cleric/Weapon Master because you only have 30 levels, but a Fighter /Weapon Master / Bard should do nicely, with a high unbuffed AB... probably a Fighter 12 / Weapon Master 16 / Bard 2 spread... for max BAB, or some other combination...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/11/06 03:19</span></i></p>

He writes low-enchantment, but says less than +10 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif"> <br><br>I agree that Dwarven defenders is often highly playable,  and I've great success mixing it with Cleric. In a 30 capped setting, perhaps Cleric12/Fighter4/DD14 with EDR in it and perhaps EWS..... You'll need 16 WIS  and high CON so STR will be lacking.

My apologies for not responding sooner, I appreciate all of the responses that have come in.  Last I checked, there were none.  In response, I do like the Dwarven Defender idea, seems like a viable option that avoids a good amount of damage in the long run.<br><br><br>However, I have found out more about the world I've been playing in.  Various other tweaks include:<br><br>- Arcane Archers are allowed to cast one of six chosen wizard spells on a stack of normal arrows, adding 1d6 damage of the chosen element to the stack for a limited amount of time.<br>- Sneaking is apparently quite powerful, as very few creatures in the game have true sight, and just as few with immune to criticals (Dev Crit can be taken at level 27+, given you fufill the requirements).<br>- Additionally, True Sight has been modified to give +10 spot, ultravision, and see invisible.<br>- Pickpocketing requires a single point to use, and only a single point.  This saves skill points for rogues. <br>- I KNOW that bows go up to a +5 Mighty, for the highest acquirable items.  Not sure about other bonuses, but I've seen +5 on items for level 15's, so I'd assume double that or slightly more for 30. NWVault lists it as a High Magic world.<br>- RDDs are somewhat nerfed, receiving only +4 Strength and +2 AC, as well as a 50% vulnerability to cold at level 10 RDD. (Not that I was planning on making one.)<br><br><br>Now, my question is: do you still reccomend a Dwarven Defender?  If not, would the following be viable?<br><br>- Arcane Archer with 6 SD (for HiPS).  If so, how would I make it without throwing in too many wizard levels? Perhaps simply an AA/Wizard/Rogue?<br>- Blackguard/Wizard/Arcane Archer (Perhaps 5/5/20?).<br>- Rogue/CoT/SD (15/5/10?). (10 SD, because I've heard that the best dexer equipment requires 10 SD levels, CoT to avoid multiclassing penalty.  Otherwise, Rog/Fig/SD.)<br><br><br>Anyway, thanks for answering all of my questions!  I appreciate the feedback.  And I too discovered the Pre-Epic Builder's guild with level 30 builds after posting this thread, but it seems to get quite a bit less activity.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By RugganDothtar on 07/13/06 01:50</span></i></p>

I was actually mulling over a progression for an AA/Wiz/Rogue, and here's what I came up with.  However, I didn't put much thought into it.<br><br>      C   BAB<br>      -   ---<br>1     W    0<br>2     W    1<br>3     W    1<br>4     W    2<br>5     W    2<br>6     W    3<br>7     R    3<br>8     R    4<br>9     R    4<br>10    R    6<br>11-28 AA<br>29    W   <br>30    R <br><br>However, that being said, I'd still like to discuss the topic at hand - specifically, that which was said in my previous post.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By RugganDothtar on 07/13/06 01:55</span></i></p>

I would try something like Cleric23/Ftr4/Rogue3.
