I'm interested in trying to play a very sneaky RDD. I would also like to have (of course) good AB and the PW is basically a +5 world which allows dev crit so a high fort is a must.<br><br>I'd like to play human, elf, or dwarf; and no wizards, clerics, or sorcerers. Oh, and evil, very, evil <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Lt me know if you need more info, thanks for the help!

If you mean Jockeb's Axe Thrower v2, it seems like a really fun build. However, I'm looking for more of a character that approaches using a really high sneak, knocks you down, kills you, and then disappears into the sunset. Oh, and I should have said human, elf, half-elf, or dwarf is required more than preferred; as the rest are children in this PW.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Letifer on 08/24/07 14:52</span></i></p>

Are you looking to do some crits, or are you looking to protect from crits?<br><br>Sounds like you want to focus on Sneak Damage for your main damage method.

Doing crits would just be a bonus, but I'd like to have high enough fort to not have to worry about them too much. As for sneak damage as primary damage type, thats fine but not required. I just don't want them to see me coming.

I would go 26 Ranger 4 Bard 10 RDD.  You'd get great damage, and with Throwing Axes, no one would see you coming.<br><br>You wouldn't need to rely on sneaks, so you could stealth from as far away as you'd like. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

Sounds like Rogue/Bard/RDD (the last two classes are musts, since you want RDD and don't want SOR). Either that or Bard/RDD/BG. The former can get you a ton of sneak attack and Epic Dodge.
