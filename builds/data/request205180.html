I've been trying to make a build using sorceror, RDD and WM to get a good balance of combat capability and spellcasting. So far he focuses on quarterstaffs, because there are no slashing weapons available without getting the martial/exotic feat, and the Blackstaff spell is somewhat useful. Here is the build, basically:<br>Str14-25<br>Dex14<br>Con14<br>Int14<br>Wis8<br>Cha14+<br>Basically, get lore to 8 as a sorceror and start taking RDD levels, getting strength throughout those(will end up at 25 by level 10 RDD) and getting the requirements for WM. At this point there's no specific order to when levels/feats are taken that I know to be best, but WM is gotten to level 6, sorceror to level 22, then an additional level of WM followed by sorceror. This should allow one epic spell, and feats not used as WM prerequisits go to maximize spell and greatersp. All points after 25str for dev crit go into cha.<br>The build's casting abilities could be better, and he has some problems with AB, not a big problem surviving. The WM levels aren't necessary, as fighter would net a lot of feats in comparison, but WM seemed the way to go, could be wrong. RDD is of course necessary to get devcrit and still have a reasonable cha. The build was leveled/tested in the CEP Novice to Epic Character Maker and was able to defeat most with just spells, but had trouble hitting.<br>Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to respond <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  .<br><br>-Johnny<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ChaoticBlades on 07/22/05 06:09</span></i></p>

If your trapped with simple weapons use the spear. 1-8x3 is better than the Qstaff. Poor staff. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">
