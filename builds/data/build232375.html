You're lucky that Paladin can have only Lawful good as alignment, but you should still put it, it's like a requisite.<br><br>You're telling us that the main difference is tha this one has XP penalty? in which way is that supposed to be good? Ok, Halfing has its good parts, but no XP penalty, 1 more feat and 1 more skill per level are much better. <br><br>I never get why people like scimitars so much.... if you are going for the critical range, using a WM is "The_Improvement"<br><br>And Divine Might? extra divine damage equal to charisma modifier out of nowhere that can be used infinite times per day, why not getting it? (of course, I would suggest to take human for that, but I don't think you'll do that).<br><br>I don't know..... Paladins are hard when you're talking about abilities, they use all of them, RDD gives a lot of STR, but HP is low, sometimes I even question the usefulness of Paladin magic (meaning, to lower WIS).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/02/06 22:19</span></i></p>

Heh, well it has 30 str damage when buffed which is reallly sweet as well (1.5x20 (maxed str)) and I have Divine Might at level 12 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> . The Scim is there to try and put all that Divine to good use with a good stream of crits. And yes HP is on the low side and so are most things apart from str but it's power is from its crushing ability tbh but it can have decent AC with divine shield as well plus it can use true strike knockdowns to reduce damage given out to it. I agree in a way to the lacking in decent magic though but the other option for this char would be cleric which lacks 4 Attacks Per Round and would require more of a frump into wisdom.<br><br>-DaMouse

Error on my last post, divine might is not infinite, once per turn undead, 29 in your case, still a lot.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/02/06 22:50</span></i></p>

Hm, he is quite alike something recent, yes,  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  I laughed at the fact you added his xp-penalty as if it were a good point. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  <br><br>Thax: turn undead=3+CHA modifier=6 times pr day. He can cast Eagle's Splendor and Aura of Glory for another 4 uses. Paladin has a bunch of useful spells, and he is undispellable at lvl 25+. I name Bless, Aid, GMW, Aura of glory, bull's, Eagle's, Divine Favor, holy Sword, Death Ward, freedom of movement. Perhaps more. Don't take 29 Pal levels without 14 WIS. Halfling and Gnome is the only way to get that nice crit-range for a 2h weapon. It will be a massive damage output even without any magic items at all. even in a High-magic world his Pally spells can give an AB of +7 from Bless, Aid, Divine Favor.<br><br>Extra turning springs to mind?<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Wait a second, he uses scimitar as both handed because he's a small race, but that makes the STR multiply X1.5 with it as normal size races using two handed weapons?
