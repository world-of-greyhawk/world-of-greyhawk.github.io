The Black Blades of Moradin are a clandestine but powerful group whose origin, motives and members are largely unknown.  Some suspect they are a new offshoot of the Zhentarim, while others believe they are a renegade group of Dwarves who monitor the movements of the Harpers.  So nebulous they are, that it is not clear whose side they are on.  In a recent Council, Khelben Arunsun noted that it is possible that "they are not on anybody's side, and may have their own agenda."  Whatever the case, Harper Scouts report that they are some kind of phantom-warrior.  <br>_________<br><br>This build is proof positive that Dwarves make the best SC V Rogues.  This scoundrel not only gets Epic Dodge and SC V, but is healthy as an ox with his 500 natural hit points.  There are few, if any, builds out there that achieve this(without resorting to a Bard/RDD/Rogue hybrid).  He is not going to go gently into that good night, I assure you.  Combined with his 310 skill points and Hide in Plain Sight, the ability to attack ranged or melee and to lay Deadly Traps, he can be the kind of opponent that some players whine and complain about, particulary from 24th level and beyond.<br><br>Note: Thanks to Pulse Cap’s search engine, I insured that this build is the first of its kind (and probably the last).<br><br>__________<br><br><b>The Black Blade of Moradin</b><br>Rogue20/Fighter10/ShadowDancer10<br><b>Playable 1-40, PvM, PvP Lite</b><br>Alignment: Any<br><br><b>Dwarf</b><br><br>Str10<br>Int14<br>Wis8<br>Dex18(30)<br>Con16(18)<br>Chr6<br><br>1Rogue, Knockdown<br>2Fighter, Weapon Finesse<br>3Rogue, Weapon Focus (rapier or shortsword)<br>4Fighter, Dodge, Dex19<br>5Fighter3<br>6Fighter4, Weapon Specialization, Mobility<br>7Rogue3<br>8Shadowdancer1, Dex20<br>9Rogue4, Improved Knockdown<br>10Rogue5<br>11Rogue6<br>12Rogue7, Improved Criticals, Dex21<br>13Shadowdancer2<br>14Shadowdancer3<br>15Shadowdancer4, Blindfighting<br>16Shadowdancer5, Dex22<br>17Shadowdancer6<br>18Rogue8, Toughness<br>19Shadowdancer7<br>20Shadowdancer8<br>21Shadowdancer9, Great Dex I<br>22Shadowdancer10<br>23Rogue9<br><i>24Rogue10, Great Dex II, Dex26, Epic Dodge</i><br>25Fighter5<br>26Fighter6, Epic WF<br>27Rogue11, Great Dex III<br>28Fighter7, Dex28<br>29Fighter8, Epic WS<br>30Fighter9, Great Dex IV<br>31Rogue12, <br>32Rogue13, Dex30, Self-Conceal I<br>33Rogue14, Self-Conceal II<br>34Rogue15<br>35Rogue16, Self-Conceal III<br>36Rogue17, Self-Conceal IV, Con17<br>37Rogue18<br>38Rogue19, Self-Conceal V<br>39Fighter10, Epic Prowess, Armor Skin<br>40Rogue20, Con18<br><br>AB: 40/35/30/25<br>Max AB: 66/61/56/51/66<br>AC Naked: 30(31)<br>Max AC w/ +8 Items: 82<br>Hit Points: <b>500</b><br>HP w/+12 Items: 740<br>Skill points: 310<br><br>Fort: 22 (28)<br>Will: 14 (20)Slippery Mind rerolls Failures<br>Reflex: 33(39)<br><br>Discipline: 43<br>Hide: 43 (53)<br>Move Silently: 43(53)<br>Listen: 11 (10)<br>OpenLocks: 10 (12)<br>Search: 15<br>Disable Traps: 20 (30)<br>Heal: 5<br>Set Traps: 43 (53)<br>Spellcraft: 18 (20)<br>Tumble: 40<br>UMD: 42<br><br><b>Strengths</b><br><i>Permanent 50% Concealment</i><br><i>Epic Dodge</i> at 24,SC IV by Lvl36<br>He can achieve a significantly <i>high AC</i> if he goes to shield mode<br>Can deliver quick, precise strikes at <i>10d6sneak</i><br><i>High hitpoints (500 raw max)</i> combined with Epic Dodge/SC V allow him to stay in combat for quite some time<br><i>Hide in Plain Sight</i>, Summon Shadow, and IKD insure Sneak Attacks at 10d6.<br>Tremendous Skill Set<br><br><b>Weaknesses</b><br><i>Will Save</i>: in testing, that was the most glaring flaw in the build.

With no AB to speak of, you'll have to go old school and rely on the roll of the dice.  Stealth will be the key to survival at level 1.

He has WS/EWS to help mitigate this.  Against PvP palemasters and other crit immune creatures or DR creatures, he will have some trouble.  Get your hands on some Traps to help even the score.  UMD can also help you buff.  Strength-enhancing items should be sought.  And remember, don't take on high level PMs without back-up!<br><br>In playtesting, I always like to challenge the 40th lvl fighter in my leveller Mod, as he usually just rips my head off.  He always buffs with potions, goes for Knockdown, and always drinks his Heals at 25% hitpoints, and is decked with decent equipment.  During this duel, however, he went straight down.  An IKD hit him from the Shadows, and then it was sneak upon sneak upon sneak upon IKD, and he was gone.  He never even got to drink his Heals.  Against the Dracolich, who is usually a real bugger, I never died, but he never did either.  I didn't have Fear Immunity, and his Fear DC was 35, IIRC, and my pidley 14 Will +1d20 roll couldn't cut the mustard.  So, he ran around, the dracolich tried to kill him, couldn't touch him, I fell asleep, woke up about 5 minutes later, Dracolich still trying to kill him, and just couldn't follow through.  Result, stalemate.<br><br><br>....    ....    ....    ....    ....<br><br>griphook ..level 31 typo corrected<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/12/07 16:14</span></i></p>

Nice build, I'd be a little worried about the AB, which is okay but you don't have any innate spell casting or Taunt to raise it.  I'd take the two CON increases and put them towards DEX instead for a +1 to AB and AC.  Also, while the Rogue 20/Ftr 10/SD 10 is the way to go if you are forced to take multiple SD levels, Rogue 29/Ftr 10/SD 1 might be a bit stronger overall. <br><br>You can write your own leveling module pretty easily.  I like doing it this way as I can customize equipment and opposition very easily to find the strengths and weaknesses of a build.

Those 8 pre-epic shadowdancer levels give the build more defensive capability with both shadow evade and summon shadow and shadow daze, and give him more options during pre-epic environments, which are the environments I tend to play most often.  The only thing that more Rogue brings to the table would be the sneak dice.  While this isn't a bad thing, I tend to find that 19 Rogue levels provide enough sneak dice to do most jobs.  In situations where 10d6 sneak aren't enough, the sneaks aren't working anyways, and so we are resorting to stand and deliver tactics, traps, UMD scrolls, etc.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

He has a few offerings <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br>This one, a dwarven stalker "epic dwarven special typo feat" aside (too funny <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    ) looks like fun, a highly playable RP'er with good hps for sure, and the AB is okay; a little low for my tastes but you've UMD upped plus traps, etc. so it's okay; overall, nicely done, GD.<br><br>This build reminds us why skills are so darn important, doesn't it? UMD really helps, of that I am convinced and triply echo (I rarely take any character out without loading up on it, even with the new NWN2, x-class still worth it as it opens up so many scolls at least, and with a sneaker, that's especially helpful particularly where, as here, it's loaded to the max). <br><br>Way to go re: Sticking up for 'dem dwarves, GD <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    (this, from a human and/or half-elf hugger, but I love 'em all - dwarves, those beards I tells ya, what's not to love <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>Love the RP factor here, and so highly versatile! <br><br>ps and thanks for the code Mith (btw, like your nwn2 hall, which I'm checking out now-looks really good so far, and thanks!!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>As to nwn1 halls, another mod/trainer I like to use is the arena of champions by commche - it's an uber magic place, and what I like to do is take characters in with mundane stuff, test 'em against the nasties (who are uber buffed, etc.). But for sure there are quite a few other good halls out there. Just thought I'd mention this one, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Sneak On!<br><br>Tyr<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 01/24/07 23:57</span></i></p>

I have a question <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>In this build, do you have to use only one weapon? (Because using a shield, will low your hide check)<br><br>Please tell me how it works, in battle <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

Yes...  Use a large shield and the penalty is much lower.

I know, but I was thinking by using dual weapons (with a tiny weapon in the off hand...)<br><br>Or a better usage of this build...
