I have been looking at Player Resource Consortium's PRC Pack v2.0c for several day, and I hesistate to use this for several reason...<br><br>I am kind of paranoid when it comes to downloading something that is required to open something that I recently downloaded.<br><br>This pak requires "Microsoft .NET Framework Version 1.1" to open the files, etc. I rather not to download that since I heard rumors(both good and bad) about this which is enough to make me hesistate.<br><br>Also, the second reason I have for not downloading this is that it overwrites certain files in the NWN which I don't want to do since it is most likely to cause it to crash or screw up something or whatever. At the present, I only have NWN on one computer, if I had second computer to do this, I would do it then.<br><br>Anyway, I would get it if it was useable in tlk files which you can add to the modules, but that is wishful thinking. It is pretty big file, so it may not happen any time soon. Unless someone out there manages to do that. And it would not happen because it means that you have to add it to the module every time you want to use your custom class.<br><br>But still, I hesistate because of those reasons above...<br><br>What are your thoughts on this? If we plan to go that way, I will consider about getting second computer and use it solely for character building with the custom classes.<br><br>Thank you in advance.<br><br>Anuis

It is not necessary to download .net, you can just use the rar version <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/hakpacks/data/1082946089000.shtml" target="_blank"><br>Click here</a><br><br>Just unzip the hak and the .hif in your hak folder (not needed if you don't install .net), erf in the erf folder, tlk into tlk folder, classes.2da into override (just remove this anytime you play another module that doesn't use it, though if you don't remove it, nothing critically game-shattering will happen (you'll just have a list of classes that are like "So this is how you" and such and are untakeable). Also, it is reccomended that you back up modules before installing as yes, we do overwrite scripts. <b>However</b> we do not modify anything inherent to the NWN engine that would affect ANY OTHER module other than the one you install it on.<br><br>Then just manually install into module.<br><br>The .net thing is there for CONVIENCE for people who WANT to have QUICK, EASY, NON-TECHNICAL installations into modules. It is NOT necessary for the pack to work.<br><br>Hope this helps!<br><br>~ Lock.<br>_________________<br>"Life builds you up just to tear you down." - 3rd Strike

Hey, after you check that out, let us know what you think. I have been considering grabbing it, but have had the same cautious approach. Im cautious with anything that involves the old big brother MS.<br><br>Also, are there any good PRC servers out there with a good mix of role-play and action? I have a group of my old PnP friends that I adventure with and we make up a great group of RP chars. Looking for somewhere that it is encouraged and rewarded. (but we love the hack and slash too)<br><br>Is there anywhere other than the brief paragraph on the vault that the PRC is reveiwed? Detailed listings of the classes.. yadda yadda yadda<br><br>Solstice[Entropy]<br>_________________<br>It's not a bad partnership. We live in harmony we do, well at least until he gets hungry and swallows a companion or two.<br><br>-Solstice on living with a symbiote link(Entropy).
