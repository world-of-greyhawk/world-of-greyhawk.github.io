syrath,<br><br>Do you want to reduce the Fighter level taken? If you are taking extra fighter level purely for feat reasons.

If you want to get more HP, move the Toughness feat to first level, meaning at the character creation. If you did that, you will be able to get 40 HP out of that.

Toughness works retroactively , however the whole amount of hitpoints now shows when you level up since the beta patch (it even gets a mention).<br><br>Its great when you take a late level and take tougness to see +44 HP.<br><br>Syrath

What about a couple more fighter levels? Your key epic DD levels are 14, 16, 20, 24, etc... Those are the levels of bonus feats and DR gains. If you go back to 20 DD and 10 fighter it'll net you one more feat.

The build wasnt built with stealth in mind to be honest, however you could spread out the shadowdancer levels quite easily so that you can keep your stealth/tumble  skills maxxed.<br><br>As for improved power attack it can be useful to help cut through an opponents DR since this build (due to being dex in nature) doesnt have a high maximum damage. However if you feel that in your world that its not neccassary then feel free to change it.<br><br>Syrath

This is why SD only becomes available on the 18th level. When I did it I stopped when the requirements were met, this was so I could dump the points at level 18 and maximise them for the sake of getting 1 extra AC for level 17 only. It kind of nerfs your skills, but fighter and DD arent exactly skill based in the first place.
