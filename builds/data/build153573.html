Syrath, you're taking a hiatus? Not going to post builds for a while? That's bad news for us :/<br><br><br>Here's a general question - I've seen a few human rogue/shadowdancer builds where the weapon of choice is shortswords. Why not rapiers? Is it because rapiers are funky in the off hand (I forget the exact cause)? I know they're finesseable, but is it the off-hand rapier still retains a -4 to hit?<br>If that's the case, wouldn't the added benefits of multiple critical hits (as compared to shortswords) offset the -4 offhand accuracy?<br><br>Sorry if that's been posted/discussed a bajillion times. I'd like to hear it from the horse's mouth though.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Scott.<br><br>PS - You'll be missed.

Im going to be tied up with a few beta tests one is a mmorpg(dont ask because I cant say which) thats likely to take most of my time. <br><br>As for using shortswords instead of rapiers there were 2 reasons. <br><br>Personal choice was one. rapiers have a higher critical range than shortswords this much is true but ill show you the comparison<br>e.g.<br>With shortswords you have an AB or 45 <br>With rapiers you have an AB of 43 <br><br>Against something with an AC 53 . The shortswords critical on a roll of 17,18,19,or 20. the rapier critical on a roll of 15,16,17,18,19 or 20. <br><br>The shortsword hits however on a roll 8 and the rapier on a roll of 10. <br><br>So the rapier hits 20 percent less than the shortsword but when it crits (roughly 9/100th of the time he does 1*more damage). So you can say 1 out of 10 hits does 1* more damage.<br><br>Now take a look at the shortsword. Over 10 rapier hits it hits 12 times. This in itself is more than the rapier damage, before we add in the effects of criticals. <br><br>If you increase the AC there is a small band where the rapier is probably better. <br><br>Syrath

BTW the critical rate is 15/100 not 9 in 100 as I posted.<br><br>However I did some calculations in excel to see how the shortsword compared with the rapier in a head to head. <br><br>DW rapier never matches shortsword on a damage per round basis. The shortsword makes more threat rolls due to the higher AB and this almost compensates against the rapier for the reduction in threat range. The shortsword however hits more normal hits on top of this for an increase in overall damage. Only when mobs reach exactly 20 to hit for both weapons does the rapier = shortsword when DW. After that criticals dont even matter. <br><br>Syrath

I hate to be a pain, but the calc there is off, it shows a +6 attribute for shortsword and +2 for rapiere,they should be the same. so that the abs are with 2 rather than a total of 6 diff.<br><br>Syrath

You can't take a Great _____ feat on the same level as a feat that needs that stat set at what the Great ______ feat would push it to (in this case, 30 dex).  It doesn't register the stat increase until after you level, unfortunately.<br>_________________<br>"Intelligence is knowing a tomato is a fruit; Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad."
