<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM</b><br><br>This build is the result of my experiments on getting 4 attacks per round, Epic Dodge and Epic Warding on the same character. Try as I did, this is the only way I managed to do it. After I'd finished it, I tested it in my own module that was built to give level 40 builds a really hard time, with no magic items. He acquitted himself rather well, and as he has a unique set of abilities, I decided I'd post the build here.<br><br>There's four different races that can be used without incurring an XP penalty - Human, Half-Elf, Elf and Gnome. I discounted Half-Elf straight away. Human is kind of pointless too, the build gets more than enough skill points and has no real need of an extra feat. <br><br>Elf is kind of nice, the +2 to Dex helps with AB and AC, and it's probably the easiest RP choice. But for powergaming, Gnome would be the best race, as Small Stature gives the same bonuses as the Elf's +2 to Dex, and it has a net gain of +4 Con (ie. 80 hitpoints at level 40) over the Elf. He also has Spell Focus Illusion, I'm not entirely sure what it does, but it seems to fit in. The only version I've built is the Gnome, because he seemed to offer the most.<br><br>Stats<br>Str 10<br>Dex 16<br>Con 16<br>Int 16<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 8<br><br>Levelling Guide<br>1 - Wizard 1 - Spell School Illusion, Dodge<br>2 - Ranger 1 - Favoured Enemy: Undead<br>3 - Ranger 2 - Weapon Finesse<br>4 - Ranger 3 - Dex +1 (17)<br>5 - Ranger 4<br>6 - Wizard 2 - Mobility<br>7 - Ranger 5 - Favoured Enemy: Human<br>8 - Shadowdancer 1 - Dex +1 (18)<br>9 - Wizard 3 - Exotic Weapon Proficiency<br>10 - Shadowdancer 2<br>11 - Shadowdancer 3<br>12 - Ranger 6 - Toughness - Dex +1 (19)<br>13 - Shadowdancer 4<br>14 - Shadowdancer 5<br>15 - Shadowdancer 6 - Weapon Focus Kukri<br>16 - Shadowdancer 7 - Dex +1 (20)<br>17 - Shadowdancer 8<br>18 - Ranger 7 - Improved Crit Kukri<br>19 - Wizard 4<br>20 - Ranger 8 - Dex +1 (21)<br>21 - Wizard 5 - Epic Weapon Focus Kukri, Empower Spell* <br>22 - Wizard 6<br>23 - Wizard 7<br>24 - Wizard 8 - Great Dex 1, Dex +1 (23)<br>25 - Shadowdancer 9<br>26 - Wizard 9<br>27 - Wizard 10 - Great Dex 2 (24), Great Int 1* (17)<br>28 - Wizard 11 - Dex +1 (25)<br>29 - Shadowdancer 10<br>30 - Wizard 12 - Epic Dodge<br>31 - Wizard 13<br>32 - Wizard 14 - Dex +1 (26)<br>33 - Wizard 15 - Great Int 2, Great Int 3* (19)<br>34 - Wizard 16<br>35 - Wizard 17<br>36 - Wizard 18 - Epic Will, Dex +1 (27)<br>37 - Wizard 19<br>38 - Wizard 20 - Great Int 4* (20)<br>39 - Wizard 21 - Epic Warding<br>40 - Ranger 9 - Dex +1 (28)<br><br>* = Wizard bonus feat<br><br>Final Stats<br>Str 10<br>Dex 28<br>Con 16<br>Int 20<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 8<br><br>BAB, using a pair of kukris, unbuffed<br>26 base<br>+9 Dex<br>+1 Weapon Focus<br>+2 Epic Weapon Focus<br>+1 Small Stature<br>-2 ITWF<br>= 37 in total, for an attack schedule of 37/32/27/22 on the main hand, 37/32 on the off. I think the maximum buffed AB possible is 65 (Empowered Cat's Grace + True Strike + Greater Magic Weapon) but I'm not sure how the buffs stack. He only gets the 2nd off hand attack on level 40, btw.<br><br>AC, mundane robe, unbuffed<br>10 base<br>+9 Dex<br>+8 Tumble<br>= 27 base. Frankly terrible, but he does have to take advantage of Mestil's Acid Sheath, Elemental Shield and Death Armour somehow. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>Hit Points, unbuffed<br>21x4 Wizard<br>+ 9x10 Ranger<br>+ 10x8 SD<br>+ 120 (Con bonus)<br>+ 40 (Toughness)<br>= 414 in total. Very good for a mage. Can be buffed to 534 using Empowered Endurance, which lets him take the full force of 2 maximised IGMS and stay standing.<br><br>Skills<br>He gets so many skill points he doesn't have to worry about not maxing out all the necessary skills. As the last level is a Ranger level, he will have Discipline, Concentration, Hide and Move Silently maxed. Tumble and Spellcraft will be 40, to get +8 to AC and +9 to saves vs. spells. I guess he could also use the much-vaunted Ranger trapping abilities too.<br><br>Strategies<br>I played the SWoW through my tester module, as i said above. My first strategy was to buff and go into melee, letting Epic Warding, Epic Dodge and Improved Invis stop me from getting hit too much. It did work well, but not as well it could have done. The AB is too low to melee monsters at level 40, while the Epic Dodge and Improved Invis stopped the damage shields from really hurting the enemies. The fights took so long it was dull.<br><br>The best strategy I came up with was to buff myself and my pets, leave my familiar and animal companion (&amp; summon, if i needed one) behind me, fire off as many direct damage spells as possible, then HiPS and hide behind the pets. Then I'd cast the damage shields and Epic Warding and start meleeing, without Improved Invis. Once the shields had worn off, Improved Invis went on, with a HiPS to get into a safer place to cast, if necessary. The damage output obviously isn't great, but empowered buffs and Flame Weapon do help out some. Against the high AC creatures, I would pretty much all my spells before going into melee, even Magic Missiles and Rays of Frost. Every little helps. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    <br><br>I only really posted the build as a curio, as I think it is the only possible way of getting 4 attacks per round, Epic Dodge and Epic Warding in one character. If you combine all that with full Wizard spellcasting and buffing, you're left with a powerhouse that is really good fun to play.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 07/07/05 23:53</span></i></p>

Funny, I was thinking about a very similar build last night. <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "153094", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Here</a> is one by yrtsns that is almost the same as yours, but with an Elf as the race. (slightly different levelling as well, and I think yours is a better build)<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Gee, thanks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br>I do like this version, and it's kind of a more melee-focused version than mine, whereas mine was an attempt to mix casting and melee. (basically try casting, and if that fails whip out the ol' rapier). There are a few things I should point out, though...<br>This version gets epic warding, which to me seems counter-intuitive in a build with epic dodge, since the idea is to not get hit, so i think epic mage armor is a better choice than a 21 round epic warding. After that warding wears off you'll wish you had 5 more ac, and in most situations this build isn't exactly a master of the quick kill, especially without metamagic feats. Just imagine facing off against a dwarven defender.<br>This build also gets 80 more hp and 1 more ab, but uses a lot of feats up to raise stats, and doesn't get any metamagic feats at all, whereas my version gets extend, empower, and maximize (lots more IGMS). You also didn't grab armor skin or epic prowess, which I found a little odd. Seems like those two would serve you better (one more ac) than two Great Dex feats would.<br>Other than that the two are remarkably similar.<br>Anyways those are my suggestions, and my explanation of why my build was as it was. Although to be honest I'm not terribly fond of the mix anyways, from a pvp perspective, but it's a fun build.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

I didn't notice that yrtsns had done a similar build, to be honest. I guess I should check through the guild index a littlemore thoroughly in future.<br><br>The main differences is that while my build is geared more for offensive manoeuvres, his is more defensive and versatile, with saving throw bonuses and all the metamagic feats. My build has dreadul saving throws, IIRC. Plus, I forgot to mention that my build actually only gets Tumble 30, so he has 2 less AC than I originally posted.<br><br>To be honest, I think that the biggest improvement I made was to start as a Wizard and not have to have 11 Wisdom. Sure, my build doesn't get any Ranger spellcasting ability, but it's worth missing out on so you can apply the stats elsewhere, especially into Con. I also chose Epic Warding rather than Epic Mage Armour, I think Warding is far more useful, as it allows you to give reciprocal damage without getting hurt. EMA may only give a +5 AC bonus, depending on items, and IMO Improved Invis and Epic Dodge are a good enough combination if you really don't want to be hit.

Yeah, that's a good point about the starting class. I definitely didn't want the ranger spells. Could get 12 con and 12 str to start and free up that epic feat used to raise con, as well as increase damage output by 1. Thanks for pointing that out.<br>Oh and I just realized you do get empower spell. Didn't see that at first, whoops. Definitely makes the build better magic-wise.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By yrtsns on 02/15/05 21:02</span></i></p>

Heh, I was still writing that when you posted, I had no idea what you'd written. Luckily it seems to make sense.<br><br>You're right about the Armour Skin &amp; Epic Prowess, I'd gain +1AC at no cost if I dropped two Great Dex feats for those two. But I wanted to get 25 Dex quickly, in order to take Epic Dodge earlier. I usually play on PvM persistent worlds, and I hate waiting until level 40 for a character to get his key abilities. I guess if I waited until level 33 to get Epic Dodge I could also get +1 AC from having 5 more ranks in Tumble, as well as being able to swap the Great Dex for AS &amp; EP.<br><br>Oh, and my build does get a meta-magic feat, Empower Spell, on level 21. I generally find it's the most useful, I just love empowered buffs. Also, empowered Negative Energy Burst is a low level spell that deals quite a lot of damage when empowered.

Hey yrtsns, I didn't mean yours was a bad build. Hope you didn't take it that way. It just seemed to me on looking at the 2 of them that Herbie's is a better fit for my play style.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
