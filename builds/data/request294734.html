Hey guys, i'm looking for a dex build ranger that really cleans up. Mostly from the build I want a high AC thats pretty hard to hit.<br><br>Requirements:<br><br>No caster (IE Sorc/Wiz/Druid/Palemaster/Shifter/)<br>Preferably Good aligned <br><br>Sword user (Rapier?)<br><br>Possibly using a tower shield also with cloth armour however.<br><br>Ranger levels must be &gt; 6<br><br>Preferably a stand and fight rather than sneak and stab<br><br><br><br><br>Setting:<br><br>+5 Equipment at best with NO Haste items at all. Weapons are the same with +5 being the limit and keen on an item is very very rare. Elemental damage doesn't exceed 2d6 I believe.<br><br><br>Also, me being so very bad at building <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  I have trouble reading anything but the full layout of the build sorry guys.<br><br><br><br><br>Help with this is much much much appreciated as I know you all take time to help the best you can

I'm not a fan of the DEX-based Ranger, as I don't particularly like the damage output. That being said, what about something along the lines of Ranger 26/SD 10/FTR 4? You could grab Epic Dodge with this build as well as having HiPS and Bane of Enemies. The FTR levels allow you to grab extra feats and/or WS/Epic WS.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I am doing a similar one right now actually; Ranger 21/SD 13/F 6.  The world I play on is <b>extremely</b> low magic, so the SD Shadowlord is a nice added summon to have when needed; still gets bane of enemies; and gets epic weapon specialization in two weapons (Bow and melee)<br><br><br>Damage output is truly very low with the small strength this build has; but AB is respectable at 42 with either ranged or melee; and Hips, Epic Dodge, and major stealth make avoiding blows pretty easy.<br><br>With the low damage output, having the multiple summons available to distract enemies becomes quite useful...<br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world

Dex based Elf Ranger 26 Bard 4 Rdd 10?  It's kind of a cookie-cutter level split, I know, but the Rdd Strength bonus should help make up for low damage.  Natural Armor bonus is nice.  UMD is handy, as is Taunt.  With 26 Ranger levels, that's 3 Epic bonus feats, so you can take a few more Great Dexes, provided you don't need the extra favored enemies.  <br><br>Don't take much if any Cha if you don't want any caster ability, or only take 10 starting and work it so your last Bard level is later than your last Rdd level so you at least get a couple of 1st and 2nd level spells per day.<br><br>Should have enough skill points (with at least 14 Int starting) to use epic traps too.<br><br>Xp penalty would be a bummer though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cry.gif">

Ah, I see what you mean about the DEX. Good point on that. But I assumed the level 25 feat would be used for Bane, so that's why I said only 2 bonus feats.
