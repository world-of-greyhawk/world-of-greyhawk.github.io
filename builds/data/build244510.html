It's a good build, but I do have a couple of thoughts to put forward. Actually, it's just one thorough point, but never mind that. <br><br>Seeing as your Death attack DC is already going to be pretty low (20), you might want to consider trading one level of assassin for another level of Ranger, to be taken on an epic feat level (say 30). On that level, swap Great Dex 1 for Bane of Enemies instead. You'll lose 1 AC, 1 AB, and 1 on all skills, but you'll gain a +2 to hit favoured enemies +2d6 extra damage against them.<br><br>Unfortunately, I have very little experience with rangers, so I'm not entirely sure this works.<br><br>Also, instead of taking epic prowess, seeing as you're specialising in Rapiers, I think you would be better off taking EWF: Rapier.

Hmmm...Thanks for the suggestion, I'll play around with it. As for the EWF, that is taken at level 21, I somehow skipped over it when I was writing it up. &gt;.&gt; Also, Bane of Enemies requires 5 Favored Enemies, now that I think about it...I have a build I'm going to post in a day or two I think you might like, though. It's somewhat like this, but it has Bane of Enemies and such...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DragonRaider69 on 06/20/06 06:32</span></i></p>

Hello. Don't include class-abilities like poison save +2 in your build-progression, makes it messy. There is nothing wrong with your format per se, but I edited out that info, and added your missing feat at 21.<br><br>It's a good build. Regarding Bane of enemies you don't need 5 FE's, you need 21 levels of ranger. That's it. That usually means you have 5 FE's, but not always. Considered Rogue in here? Not sure it would weaken the build, although Ranger and assassins have some nice synergies.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

I still don't understand why people make PvP dex builds that don't have epic dodge and don't pay attention to their con score or hitpoints.  Who are you going to kill before they kill you?<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

He's got 66 AC after +5 equipment in his writeup - many of my <b>non</b> PvP melee builds can hit that little AC using +5 equipment.  <br><br>A strong battle cleric build can selfbuff its AB to the point where the first, fourth, and fifth attacks in each round will hit 66 AC practically <i>every time</i> with no gear at all.  (Of course, he can also just Harm you and sneeze).  A bard with 40 base AB can, through a combination of selfbuff and curse song, hit it almost every time with its full AB attacks too.  Even better, said bard will be able to hit you with Knockdowns against a discipline check that isn't very high to start with and has been penalized by the curse song.  They'll knock you down and then you'd better hope they roll a 1 at some point because they'll just keep hitting you with KDs and preventing you from getting up.<br><br>The short version is that a serious PvP melee character is not going to have their accuracy very highly impeded by less than 75 AC post-buffs and gear.  There are a lot of melee builds on this forum with an AB in the 40-45 area but that aren't designed for PvP and have enough buffs and side capabilities to get their licks in against less than 70 AC, for that matter. <br><br>The only people who aren't gonna hit you on their first attack against 66 AC are people who have other ways of kicking your butt, spellcasters.

Add to that as well that, contrary to the feat description, Epic Dodge avoids the first successful <i>hit</i> of the round, not the first attack. It will negate a natural 20 hit as well, so aside from what Xylo pointed out, if you're up against an opponent who can only hit you on a natural 20, well he basically won't hit you.

Don't worry Xylophone. Soonish I'm going to post an old build I made 2 or so months ago that you might like. Fully buffed AC 67 (75 when using a good small shield), 50% concealment and epic dodge. In all honesty, I can't remember the last time he got hit.

Oh, you can make a cleric that can beat a pure melee build...Some accomplishment, bud. I never claimed this build could beat everything on the freaking forums. Nor did I claim it could beat any Cleric. You want a build that can thrash your clerics? Good, because I got plenty I'm willing to post. Honestly, NWN Powerbuilding is like playing a game of chess...Some of us are good, some of us have about as much skill as those kids they keep from everyone else in High School. This build can beat PLENTY of other melees, though...And the MAIN reason it had 66 AC is because about half of that equipment doesn't give AC, AND he has no haste with that gear. I don't go on your builds and say "Such and Such can thrash it!" You don't do the same to mine.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DragonRaider69 on 06/21/06 16:48</span></i></p>

Sorry if you were offended, I was indeed replying to someone else, and if you don't like my input feel free to ignore it.  However, I'd say that you do so at your own peril.<br><br>It helps to have a thick skin when posting things for public consumption.<br><br>Edit - I should add, most of my builds are designed for PvE because I feel that the majority of the good PvP builds have already been done.  If not all the good PvP builds.  PvP has a different - and higher - set of standards by which to judge things.  There is only so much room at the very top of the PvP ladder.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Xylophone on 06/21/06 17:57</span></i></p>

You know a lot of servers have taken out Epic Dodge, right? That's one reason I made this build...A lot of servers take out Devastating Crit, and they feel that to balance it, they should take out Epic Dodge. Now, on a server where Epic Dodge is allowed...I'd reccomend my Ranger/WM/SD, or a wide assortment of Cleric DEXers, lol. HOWEVER...On servers without Epic Dodge? I'd probably go with something like this...As for the criticism...Just a pet peeve of mine, PLEASE don't post "This, and This, and This, and This" will nail your build. I know it will, and about 90% of people reading these forums will. If you're going to tell me the weaknesses of my build, which I know, offer me a way to fix them, at least...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DragonRaider69 on 06/21/06 20:04</span></i></p>

I think there's value in pointing out the weaknesses of a build so that others who look at it can see what they are, and perhaps try to adjust it to their environment with those weaknesses in mind. That's part of the reason for posting them here: to get input on what's good and what's weak in the build, so the builder and/or others that look at it can perhaps make changes to improve it.<br><br>Pointing out the build's weaknesses is by no means an indication it's a bad build.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...
