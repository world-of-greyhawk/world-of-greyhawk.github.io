Playable level 1-40, PvM or PvP<br><br>The Gothic Champion<br>by Deborah Wattier<br><br>This is a variation of an earlier character, inspired by our very own Grim, who likes to see Terrifying Rage in Barbarians, so here it is. Unlike the other build, which was/is the first of its kind in terms of the class combo selected (and based upon a legendary character upon whom Germanic hero stories are made), this build is a rager, but not the first of its kind. There are four other builds on the pulse cap which utilize the same class-combo, being different as to the level split. <br><br>Concept: We may think of this build, the Gothic Champion, as a noble beserking warrior leading up to the period before the break in their camp, the Visigoths to the West, and Ostragoths to the East. It was believed that the later did not ransom off their captives or retain them as slaves, as was quite common throughout the region, but sacrificed them to their g*ds instead. It is believed that, in addition to Odin, the Goths worshipped in particular a variation of Tyr (then the war god, who at some later point became associated with justice). For this, the Goths were feared by all who opposed them, and especially the Hunns, with whom they constantly fought, and making the terrifying rage feat in this version appropriate <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>And now, without further adieu:<br><br>The Gothic Champion: <br>Barbarian(15), Bard(15), Champion of Torm(10)<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Neutral Good Preferred, but any non-lawful<br>Hitpoints: 530 (610 Rage / 616 Rage + Song)<br><br>Final Stats:<br>STR: 16 (26)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 16 (18)<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 13<br>CHA: 13 (16)<br><br>Saving Throws:<br>Fortitude: 	35 (36) (+5 Divine Wrath) (+2 Raging) <br>Will: 		22 (26) (+5 Divine Wrath) (+2 Raging)<br>Reflex: 	25 (29) (+5 Divine Wrath)<br><br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Traps: +3<br>Other: Barbarian Speed, Damage Reduction<br><br><br>COMBAT STATISTICS (mundane great sword):<br>Base (BAB, Naked): 29, AB: +41/+36/+31/+26 (non-buffed) <br>AB: +52-plus (Bard Buffs Only) / AB: +59 (Bard Buffs, Raging + Divine Wrath) <br>Other Modifications: Curse Song, Taunt, Improved Knockdown, Terrifying Rage, ...(north of AB +65 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     <br><br>* Rage Duration: 5 to 8 Rounds (*Con-Mod. + 1d3)<br>* Divine Wrath Duration: 4 to 5 Rounds (*Cha-Mod. + Eagle’s) <br><br><br>Combat Damage (Mundane Great Sword): <br>2-12, +8 (crit. 17-20/x2) (15-20 w.

A couple of suggestions:  <br><br>1. Drop your int to 12 and raise your CHA to 14. This will free up an epic feat, but you will not be able to take improved knockdown, which is fine because you didn't take curse song.  Take curse song pre-epic and take blind-fight on improved knockdown feat.<br><br>2. Drop two CoT levels and take another Barbarian and Bard level. The extra Bard level lets you get a better bard song/curse song (good for another +1 to AC on the bard song and -1 to opponent's AC on the curse song) an extra level 2 spell and a level 6 spell if you buff your charisma.  The extra barbarian level lets you take terrifying rage at at a lower level, since you can take the last barb level at level 40.  You lose +1 to all your saves, a feat and your divine wrath is weaker.  So you can determine whether it is worth it or not.<br><br>Other than that it seems like a good build.  Actually, for a build that increases three attributes, I'm surprised that it is as good as it looks.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Hey, Mith: really nice to see you! And glad to hear you like this fellow (you know, your teachings are in here <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>as to the curse song. . . EGADS, you're right; it should be - at level 6, then, dropping extra music and taking lingering song at level 9. Thanks for pointing out the error; will have that immediately rectified! (and that's what I get for posting so late at night .... ARRRR).<br><br>Will be back .... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>(thanks, Mith; and sorry to all for that).

OK, error/typo corrected, i.e. curse song . . . whew!
