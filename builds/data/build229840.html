Well I've seen these kinda builds on my server and they simply work with PvP.<br><br>Though most of them use few rogue lvls for evasion and tumble. Some even go to lvl 10 to get the Crippling Strike, but since (I think) your goal is to get a really high AB, I must say you've done so.<br><br>Only I would try to squeeze in KD and IKD, with that AB everything which gets KD'd is sure to die by a critical (unless immunue).<br><br>Also str 33 gives you... +11 to damage so + 55 on critical... not bad either I suppose <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Crossclassing Spellcraft might be an idea also, but that depends on if you got skill points to spare. (Drop 1 dex and put it in int, since you will be walking with heavy armor most of the time)<br><br>Well I'm not really a specialist on building yet, but those are some improvements I would suggest.<br><br>// Maniac_Mailman<br>_________________<br><i>"Omnes morimur et quasi aqua dilabimur in terram, qua non revertuntur..."</i><br>- Maniac_Mailman aka Nr|Five<br><br>Admin @ NWN BOTD Team PvP<br>Admin @ <a href="http://www.gameshrine.org" target="_blank">www.gameshrine.org</a><br><br>Member of the Epic Character Builders Guild

In addition to the above, drop WM to 28 and take another level of fighter, for an additional feat (I recommend another Great Strength, to get an even ability score).  Levels 29 and 30 of WM get you absolutely nothing.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Nimueh_Leafbow on 02/09/06 00:38</span></i></p>

Why end on an odd-numbered STR score? There's no advantage. Start with 16 STR and put the extra 3 points elsewhere (either raising INT to 14 and WIS to 10 to grab more skill points and boost your Will save, or drop DEX to 13 as well and raise CON to 18 for more HPs).<br><br>Also, I'd drop a level of FTR and WM and pick up 2 Rogue levels to get Evasion and access to Tumble and UMD. Or, 2 Bard levels for a meager Bard Song boost, Tumble, Spellcraft, and UMD. If you take these levels in epic, you'll end with the same AB.<br><br>*edit* And leave Intimidate at 4: it's useless for anything but a Barbarian build with Terrifying Rage.<br>_________________<br>Captain's Log, Stardate 6051: had trouble sleeping last night... my hiatal hernia is acting up.

Most people would consider the "Reaper" to be more of a human type of creature (certainly not a dwarf).<br><br>I'm wondering what you think the starting stats for this build should be for a Human.  I am thinking:<br><br>STR: 17<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Or, possibly:<br><br>STR: 16<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 16<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 13<br>CHA: 8<br><br>What do you think?

Go FTR 6/CoT 6/WM 28, better saves, one more feat. Starting STR at 16 seems enough to me, anyhow you are ending on an odd numbered STR which is mostly useless.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

In many ways skills are as valuable (and sometimes even moreso) than feats.<br><br><b>Spellcraft:</b> Every 5 modified ranks in Spellcraft gives you +1 on all your saves vs spells.

You spend a general feat for EWS on lvl 24, take Great STR instead and voila, even STR score at the end. Then, trade 1 lvl of WM for fighter which nets you the feat you need for EWS.<br><br>And listen to Kail, with some shuffling pre-epic you could go Fighter6/CoT6/WM28. Will increase saves. Remember that CoT feats can be used for EWS to, as long as you take WS on a fighter level. so you would loose absolutely zip and gain better saves.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Man, I completely screwed up there, should get KD much earlier for playability, not using the WM needed feats so soon, plus, changing 2 Great STR for Toughness and Blind-Fight, 40 more HP with blind fight to be able to kill those ethereal characters so much easily at only 1 AB and damage penalty.

My suggestion is to go with bard instead of rogue for your cheesey lvl to be able to max out spellcraft too. Your problem is that you miss the skillpoints if I'm not mistaken.<br><br>You could go human for 1 more feat preepic (toughness to make up for the lost constitution) and the possibility to max out one more skill (spellcraft if you take bard as I suggested). Otherwise start dwarf with 16 CON, 17 STR, 14 INT for more skillpoints and one more epic feat (epic will or ESF:spellcraft f.e.) ending on the same STR. Less HP but better saves.<br><br>Answering your question: the critical multiplier bonus from weapon master gets counted in by overwhelming critical so that your scythe is considered as having a x5 multiplier, therefore +4d6 damage on a crit.<br><br>You could download Kamiryn's spreadsheet, it helps a lot with formatting and speeds up the building process.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Stand and fight, live by your heart<br>Always one more try, I'm not afraid to die<br>Stand and fight, say what you feel<br>Born with a Heart of Steel!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 03/02/06 12:03</span></i></p>

One more suggestion - drop the odd fighter level for an early Rogue or Bard level. That will let you get a skill dump at level 22, which will make levelling up much easier from that point. Costs nothing - same feats, same AB. End up at WM 28/Fighter 10/Bard or Rogue 2. I picked 22 so you can bump tumble to 25, you could do it earlier if you want, but doing it before level 20 will cost 1 AB.<br><br>TM

Oops, you are right - he would have to take the first Rogue level pre-epic. Costs 1 AB, gains Evasion and an early Tumble/UMD dump, and moves 1 fighter bonus feat form pre-epic to epic. You would have to move knockdown back to epic, or drop it for an epic feat.<br><br>TM

You make no sense, why adding Monk to a build would give more HP? Monk HP is 8 per level while both WM adn Fighter have 10, I would lose HP, so it can't be compared as "lots more HP", although, now that I think about it (this is edited) it might be a typing error for "lost more HP", yeah, that's more coherent. Yeah, no AC becuase you use Monk armor instead of Heavy.<br><br>I like Monks, it's my favorite class (love the 10 APR it can get), this is my ony build which doesn't have a Monk level, I've posted a monk/cleric, a monk/WM/blackguard, a monk/druid/CoT, a monk/druid/assassin and a monk/dwarven defender so stop the Monk a little bit man.<br><br>I wouldn't change the weapon, the trick on this build is to make a X5 critical with 4d6 overwhelming and dev crit, it can easily make over 250 with STR capped and a strong magical weapon.

By taking 4 monk pre-epic (with 5 &amp; 6 coming in epic levels) you save 2 feats, cleave &amp; knockdown, 3 feats if you go for IKD, this means you can also take toughness as a feat -&gt; 40 HP!<br><br>Whilst technically you are losing 1 bonus fighter feat, this more than makes up for the added loss of AB with IKD <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!
