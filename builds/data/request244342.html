Hi, I'm looking for a no frills PvP only caster that can do max positive/devine dmg, then either finish with melee or g ruin before opponent heals.  The server I play on has crit/sneak immune builds that are vulnerable to these types of dmg, but have their HP between 800-1000.  Some have monk lvls with high SR, so max DC is an issue as well.<br><br>Any help appreciated <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Hmmm, hard to say, few strong spells make divine damage, I'd actually go with Druid's Firestorm, which is decent fire and divine huge area... as well as good melee shiftings. I'm actually making a build which might work regularly for you (and should be up soon, it's practically done), it's a Druid20/Monk2/Cleric18, made for using Divine Might and Shield while shifted (improved elemental forms), gets 26 CHA unbuffed for good divine melees, lots of buffs plus the Firestorm at max power (although low DC) along with all druid and cleric spells, so you get any divine thing you can ever imagine.<br><br>SR works against spell penetration, which is defined by the level of the caster (only the specific caster class) and its spell penetration feats, but if there are high SR monks my build would work only melee. BTW, a monk can get an SR that can surpass any spell penetration, but those monks are regularly weak (or at least among melee parameters) and Mestil's Acid Sheath should take them out in most cases.<br><br>Another option would be to forget the whole divine part, since it's quite hard to go divine casting, give us more info about the server and stuff.

You should probably look for Paladins, CoTs and Clerics, or even Blackguards, generally those use divine powers. And here's mine: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "233821", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Godly archer (Paladin 8 / Bard 3 / Arcane Archer 29)</a> pretty high base divine damage in arrows, with a decent AB, but low resistance.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 06/24/06 03:48</span></i></p>

Thanks for the ideas.....I was mainly looking for something to deal maximum divine/positive energy dmg to creatures with these specific vulnerabilities, but also having high con and HP over 1000.  Only one of them has high SR, but the rest could potentially be handled with spells; provided they aren't given enough time to heal in between casts.
