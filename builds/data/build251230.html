You can possibly level up with an AC and AB on par, but your hpæs are loooow and your damage is sooo lacking for quite a while it's an overstatement to claim it to be playable 1-40.<br><br>No uncanny dodge until Epic, Epic dodge at lvl 39. No damage until the sneak-attacks start catching up. It might be playable from around lvl 15 given that you can rest as much as you want. 8d6 sneak-attack averages about 28 damage.<br><br>It should be a nice PvP build on lvl 40 and a bit before that, but like everything some builds will be a pain.<br><br>I get a feeling that you mostly PvP at lvl 40 taken into consideration how your builds and comments go. This true? Just wondering, nothing wrong with that. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Aye thats totally true grimnir ... lvl 40 pvp <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>As for leveling it up , its quite ok surprisingly ... because on almost every server you find a lowbie area with undeads , and bless weapon with its 2d6divine dmg vs undeads helps alot.So go for those places ^^<br> <br>As for fighting normal npcs , youre good in a team as you are the imp kd ler making those with less ab but more dmg(rogues i.e.) hit more.<br>However the dmg is quite low, the crits ,gmw and divine favour help alot here ,esp at lvl 15 as you mention.<br>A cleric or mage buffing you with DF/FW helps too. <br>(I dun like playing alone so...)<br><br>As for epic dodge on lvl 39..you can get it on lvl 33 already if you delay the fighter lvls and go rogue all the way after reaching lvl20. helps with damage as well.just take the 6th gr dex on lvl 39 then.

Funny, no mention of the xp penalty...  a nsty one at that.   THere is a tweak you can do that would make this build alittle more effective.  YOu take paladin to 20, yet you have 4apr.  If you were to take 10 rogue lvls pre you would help yourself alot wrt damage output (as stated by grim).  If you do it right, you could end with 15bab pre.  THis would allow you to exploit div fav (for which you have both 1st and 2nd slots) to get 4 apr, 2 with FULL power.   Doing the split this way would increase the playability of the char tremendously.   <br><br>All in all, you should take the pvm comment out of the build.  You are a dexer with NO str and NO con which makes early lvls difficult.. not impossible, but difficult.  And, that you stated that you indeed play this pvp lv 40!   It is very easy to tell that that is your style of play, and you should state that, not that its pvm cuz it could be made much easier if it were pvm.   <br><br>Otherwise, I like the idea of roguish pals <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

To get 15 BAB pre-epic with this level split, well he can't. The least possible, by taking at least 13 Rogue-levels pre-epic, is 16. And you also mix up Divine Favor and Divine Power.

Its good for what it is, a high magic level 40 PvP build.  It isn't very playable until you start getting into epic levels and the low HP make it scary to play in anything other than high magic.  A few suggestions:<br><br>1. Drop opportunist for a great dex, and lower your starting dex to 19.  That would give you 3 attribute points to put into con or strength for some more HP, or <br>remove that damage penalty at low levels.<br><br>2. Take one of the fighter feats instead of opportunist and drop a fighter level pre-epic for a +1 to fortitude and an extra feat to spend on something, maybe dodge for another point of AC or expertise to get that AC up even higher (you don't really get the benefit of epic dodge unless your opponent can only hit you on a 20).<br><br>Nothing to add other than that, good build.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Dropping the start dex to 19 and gaining 3 pts leaves you with uneven  stats, a waste in my opinon.<br><br>Fighter wouldnt give you another 1point of fort as pally has fort as its prim save.<br><br>If you really want feats like dodge ,exp and imp exp/or thoughness so you dont have to be scared anymore <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ...replace opportunist with epic prowress and switch the lvls to 16pal8fighter16r.You still get same ab/ac +3feats more. just a few spells less.

IMO, going 16 8 16 is not really viable...as far as I was aware, the point of having 4 fighter levels in the epic was to get the 3 necessary combat feats (ep, ewf, as) whilst leaving all normal epic feats available for great dex I-VI &amp; ESF: disc* ...the Rogue feats are all used in getting Epic Dodge!<br><br>* I see this as imperative on ALL PvP builds<br><br>I can only presume that Nike took Opportunist as a Rogue feats was to make the build more generally viable PvM as well as PvP<br><br>So, taking 8 fighter levels would LOSE you one epic feat in comparison to the ESF: Disc version!

Yup , 16-8-16 only works when u can easily obtain a high disc of items as you need the 16th rogue for epic dodge and the 7 regular epicfeats for 6gr dex + ep/ewf or as <br><br>I mentioned in my post (under what can be changed) that oppotuninst can be replaced with crippling strike or esf disc depending on the environemtn you play in. <br>If you fight lots of econo clerics,pallies basically that everything that has low caster lvls ..they dont have ICC so the +4 IS handy.<br><br>When you can get +50disc of items (which i ve seen on way to many servers ) esf disc isnt needed.<br><br>If immy to abilty drain is available crippling is useless.<br><br>maybe i should mark that so its more obvious that this can be switched w/o ruining the ac/ab.<br><br><br>err...why cant I edit my own posts lol???<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By bloodymerc on 08/29/06 21:57</span></i></p>
