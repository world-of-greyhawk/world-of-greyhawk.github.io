What exactly does the parry skill provide in pvp or pvm? I thought it was useless?

I can't remember the exact words, but the parry skill, I am assuming with certain amount of points into it, would block 3 attack per turns.<br><br>So if this player has 4 attacks, you would only block three of the coming attacks and get hit by the fourth attack.<br><br>But if the player has 3 attacks, you can block all of them.<br><br>With two players that has three attacks each, you block them all. But one with 4 attacks and other has three, you will block all of the attacks from the second player, but you will not block the last attack from the first player.<br><br>Make sense? I am not exactly sure about this though. Hopefully, someone who knows more about this would post here shortly.<br><br>Anuis

You can Parry as many attacks each round as you have yourself.  It's not dependant on your ranks of Parry or anything.<br><br>However, due to a bug (some argue it's not a bug, but I think it is since it goes against the description of the skill), you can only Parry 3 attacks tops from one character per round.<br><br>If you're fighting two people with 3 attacks per round, and you have 6 attacks per round yourself, you can Parry all of the attacks.  If one of them has 4 attacks, you can Parry 3 of them, but 1 won't be checked.  The 3 on the other guy still will be.<br><br>Back on topic:  I mean this as constructive as possible, but I think you should re-name this build.  It's definitely not the "master" of Parrying.  It's good at it, sure, but you're missing Skill Focus: Parry as a feat, and it's a Strength based build.<br><br>A real "Master of Parrying" would be a dual-wielding Dex-based Monk, with Skill Focus: Parry, Improved Parry, and Epic Skill Focus: Parry.  Maximum attacks per round from monk AB, all Parry feats, no armor check penalty, and Dexterity based allows for a huge boost to the skill.
