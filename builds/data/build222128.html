The 2 COT levels were for a bonus feat without AB loss or exp penalty.  A nice side effect is a +1 to saves.<br><br><b>Q:  Why take epic penetration?  Your wisdom's only 19.  Heck, for that matter, why is your wisdom only 19?</b><br>A:  It's 19 to cast 9-th level spells.  It would be 20 if the build had room to make it so, but it doesn't unless you sacrifice the spell penetration.  As for why take spell penetration, it gives you offensive casting using various cleric spells (such as the no-save harm and word of faith) as an option.<br><br>The main goal of being level 26 cleric was to get over the dispel cap and get a couple bonus feats, and while you can level off your wisdom and take a couple melee combat feats by dropping penetration I think that overall the casting power is more beneficial.<br><br><b>Q:  Why cleric/bard?</b><br>A:  Because it's a great combination for combining party support and self-buffed melee.  You can buff and heal your party, fill a front-line tanking/melee damage role, and do some offensive casting/debuffing as well.<br><br><b>Q:  But without auto-still spell your bard casting is kind of limited, isn't it?</b><br>A:  Actually, many of the important in-battle bard spells don't need to be stilled.  War Cry, Darkness, and Displacement are good bard spells for this character; Keen Edge, Cat's Grace, and Improved Invisibility can be cast out of combat; haste can be stilled or cast extended outside of combat.<br><br><b>Q:  What domains do you suggest?  Why not travel and trickery?</b><br>A:  I suggest Strength as a good way to get more divine powers per day, healing to get empowered healing spells and extra heals per day, plant to get barkskin and creeping doom, or war for the domain power and cat's grace/aura of vitality.<br><br>Since you get haste and improved invis as bard spells, travel and trickery aren't as attractive.  You could still take them for longer duration undispellable buffs you can cast in armor, but I don't like overlapping the capabilities that much.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 12/02/05 20:12</span></i></p>

I am no lover of the faith-inspired, but I do like Cleric/Bard Combos.  This looks to be fairly balanced, Xy.  Well Done.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 11/30/05 02:33:12 (GMT) -- Xylophone<br><br>Since you get haste and improved invis as bard spells, travel and trickery aren't as attractive.

Especially considering that Bard10 isn't picked up until Level 33.  But UMD is the great equalizer.  Still it would be nice to get a steady supply from Cleric in the pre-epic portion of the career.  Let me qualify that with I always am more concerned about characters during 1-18 that I am 19-40.  I am probably an aberration, so take what I say with a grain of salt.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

My main thing is that almost every power-built cleric ends up with travel and trickery domains - primarily for haste and improved invis.<br><br>But other domains offer some really nice things for this build - strength, for example, lets you get divine power as a level 3 cleric spell.  Plant gets you barkskin and creeping doom (+5 natural AC and a super no-save attack spell).  War gives you a nice buffing domain power for an ugly fight per day, plus aura of vitalty.<br><br>There is some benefit still to having trickery or travel (or both) which is why I mentioned them... but I like the fact that bard levels give you the flexibility to take different domains without losing haste and II.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
