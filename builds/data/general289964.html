No.<br><br>It's only 20/+1 and at level 20+ odds are you opponent is hitting you with something of at +1 anyways, which would make it useless.<br><br>Rats can nibble but they won't break skin.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

Oh well, of course, but damage resistance covers from elemental damage, it isn't the exact same thing. Immunity + Reduction can work against the same type of damage, but good pointing out anyway.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

...for the record, the 20/+1 damage reduction of monks, though not very useful in melee is great to prevent the effects of magical physical damage. For example, physical damage from Ice Storms, Blade Barriers and Bigby's Middle Fingers!
