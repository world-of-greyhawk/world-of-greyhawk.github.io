Ive been leeching through these threads for a long time. Hopefully the following hasnt been posted or attempted because it bends more to the roleplaying side in me then the powergaming side. I love power though. You can slice him, you can dice him, but the little man just keeps on coming. Not really. This build is for a PW so SD was taken early in order to assist in leveling. I would love any feedback or muchkiness that could turn this into something better.<br><br>Ow!..... OW! What the @$#$! *You look down to see a little halfling dressed in black with a mask over his face slicing at your ankles yelling "We fight...FOR FREEDOM!!"<br><br>The character concept is that of a, you guessed it a Shire Ninja. Key points in staying in tradition is using the Katana as a two handed weapon and using only shrukiens. He stalks his enemy, setting traps.

Nice... I'd drop 2 of those Imp Sneaks for Knockdown and IKD so you can force some poor soulss to take some Sneak attacks when they think they can out think you. The SD pre-epic hurts but not terribly since you have those WM classes with it.

Sorry Ninja... but CONS... 3 attacks per round and poor AC.<br><br>PRO- Does the Katana count as a 2 Handed weapon on a Halfling... 1.5 damage right?

Some interesting choices in this build (like being a strength-based ninja).  Really funny concept though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   I'd love to see an army of masked halflings with katanas.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

The katana counts as 2 handed (1.5 str) for medium size also, but you must not have anything in the off hand

I'd like to offer an alternative, though it's been about 4 years since I made this build, so I can't remember which feat is taken when, but most of you should be able to figure it out. The main difference is that this build has Devastating Critical and uses a Scythe (and is therefore not a halfling), which has a x4 critical multiplier. Most battles usually take maximum 2 hits, occasionally a few more when up against "impossible" opponents. I can't remember what the max damage is it can do (usually enemies don't survive a dev crit hit anyway), but 200 damage per hit is common, maximum should be around 280 with a standard scythe. With a Frost Scythe (+5 enchantment, keen, massive criticals: +2d12 damage) you can easily go over 300. <br><br>Peny the Killer<br>Human CE<br><br>Starting Stats<br>STR 16 to 26<br>DEX 16<br>CON 13<br>INT 13<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 8<br><br>Feats:<br>Weapon proficiency (exotic), Dodge, Mobility, Spring attack, Expertise, Whirlwind attack, Weapon Focus (scythe) --&gt; These are for meeting the Weapon Master prerequisites<br>Power attack, Cleave, Great cleave, Improved critical, Overwhelming critical, Devastating critical --&gt; for maximum critical threat range (+killing several opponents in a few seconds)<br>Improved sneak attack IV --&gt; for even greater damage<br>Epic weapon focus --&gt; as far as I remember this is not necessary for the build to work, it's optional<br><br>Skills<br>Hide and Move Silently should go as high as possible<br>I think WM requires 4 ranks in Intimidate<br>Tumble to 40 for more AC<br>others are optional (my highest were: Use magic device, Pick Pocket, Lore, Spot)<br><br>AC: 21<br>AB: 36 (24 base)<br>Fortitude: 17<br>Reflexes: 26<br>Will: 15<br><br><br>Pros<br>Very very very high damage<br>Devastating Critical<br>HiPS<br><br>Cons<br>Moderate AC (21)<br>Low will and fortitude saves<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Nylen Estrall on 09/29/09 10:57</span></i></p>
