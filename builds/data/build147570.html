It doesnt make sense with the order you have taken Epic Weapon Focus (+2AB) and epic prowess(+1AB)<br><br>Both feats are available at level 29. Yet you choose the lesser of the 2 first. <br><br>In fact you choose great dex before you choose either of these even though as a feat it really is only worth half an AB offensively. I would take these first before taking any of the Dex feats.<br><br>I also feel that the inclusion of Self concealment into the build is a waste of feats. This is purely my own opinion. Self concealment is a great feat , but 4 feats for 40 percent is a heavy price to pay. I personally feel that Self concealment is only worth it if you plan to couple it with epic dodge. The effect of this against a melee/ranged character is awesome and makes it worth the expenditure of all those feats. <br><br>As an example I created a module with a goblin, gave him 6 hp, 90 AC , epic dodge and SC 5. So far I have loosed off 1500 arrows at him on 3 seperate tests and have yet to hit. This is with an AB of 69 with a northwind bow. <br><br>With just self concealment V I kill him in the first 40 attacks.<br><br>Syrath

p(Chance that you will hit the goblin with at least two attacks when attacks a round=5)= 1-(39/40)^5-2*(1/20*39/40^4)= 0,028535517578125.<br><br>1500 arrows? Your test must have been faulty.

No it's because blind fight doesn't help with ranged attacks, and with a 90 AC he needs 20s to hit. IT is basically a target dummy set up to test concealment.

I accept what you say about the Great DEX(SC prereq) but if you take epic weapon focus first you still have +2 AB from level 29, instead of +1 AB. This is to the benefit of your build between levels 29 and 33 at no extra cost. This would benefit anyone playing your build. As for the self concealment I did state that it was my opinion and I will restate its still a good choice since AA has a really offence it doesnt hurt to lower this a little to gain greater defence. <br><br>Why do you always presume that a criticique is a personal attack. I stated that the SC thing was my own opinion and the other critique even you cant find fault with since it gives you a free +1AB between level 29 and 33.<br><br>Syrath<br><br>Emril BTW I also tested melee against it, as long as the attacks remain at 4 it seems impossible to hit, 5 attacks very rare to hit, 6 attacks seems to kill it off in less than 3 minutes. Remember though it only has 6 hp one hit kills it.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By syrath1001 on 08/13/04 21:36</span></i></p>

It's just a suggestion...</i><br><br>Great Wisdom or Dexterity - Nope, I may get more AC, but I'm still hittable.<br><br>Great Constitution or Epic Dodge - Nope, not meant to be tank. 400 HP would be the max if I did. Wishful thinking but no.<br><br>Armor Skin - Didn't I already get this?<br><br>Called Shot - I would get rid of Rapid Shot if I really want this feat. CS is better than Rapid Shot for many reasons especially when using an archer build. Why screw up my epic levels bonus for this? The only beef I have with this is that most fighters-types have high Str and discipline score making Called Shot extremely difficult to land and it mages don't really run or Fight. That's what makes it useless.<br><br>Improve &amp; Superior Initiative - Nope because my Initiative is already a 1d20+10 alone.<br><br>Overwhemling &amp; Devastating Critical - Once these feats become available to players with archers, SC and Epic will become almost irrevelant.<br><br>Improve/Expertise - Fawking waste of time. Prolong a battle for 10 extra AC and - 10 AB? I will go up to 35 to 40 AC, which isn't worth it against guys who can swinf for +40 AB and up.<br><br>Great/Spell Focus &amp; Save boosting feats - Same as raising my HP points. Wishful thinking, but not worth it in the long run.<br><br>Self-Concealment is the best thing because I don't get any other type of defensive except that. I thought this build out before building it. The archer that can land both ED and SC 50% is the Rogue Archer build, if you switch out the extra improve Sneak Attacks.

I would expect a player to have these stats, and I would expect a monster attacking me to have an even harder time if I took the same feats. Imagine going up one on one against a 4 attack per round boss mob when you know you are going to be hit so rare that you wont have to worry about it for 10-20 minutes before 1 hit lands. This is providing you can counter its spells, (easy enough with silence spell, cast it on yourself and go into combat) <br><br>My main point was about the epic weapon focus/Epic prowess. This is a free level 29-33 upgrade. Im just trying to point out a free improvement.<br><br>Syrath<br><br>EDIT btw bard8/SD16/AA16 can get Epic dodge and SC 5. It sacrifices a fair amount of offense, to get a huge amount of defense.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By syrath1001 on 08/13/04 23:45</span></i></p>

Then go make your own build. You have the levels you want, go make it. Not trying to sound spiteful, but your playing style and build.

I already have made an bard/SD/AA with epic dodge and SC5.<br><br>As for making your build by just changing round 2 feats and taking away SC 4. That would be just making your build changing 2 feats and taking away SC4. Not exactly a challenge for me, nor would I want to. I like the look of the build, its got speed, avoidance, offense rolled into one. Looks to be the perfect kiter. <br><br>I still say you should change round the 2 feats next time you post it since it improves the build at no cost. <br><br>Does it actually cost you anything to say "good point, ill change that, but I disagree with you on the SC 4 since I have found it to be useful when coming up against melee fighters and helps to keep the damage down" . Which is pretty much what other people would do. <br> <br>Syrath

Syrath, it's pointless to agrue some simple reassignent of feats to get a bit more out of the build as well as makeing it more playable from 1-40 and not just at level 40. We've all tried many times to help Tyr improve her builds, but I guess she misses the point of posting builds here. She doesn't seem to want to take what she thinks as finished and improve it. You point out valid examples of how effective a feat would be, but it doesn't matter. She probably doesn't want to work on the build anymore, but rather spew out another that will need a lot of work. You tried to help. Some people are just very unresceptive. It's to bad too, because her ultimate archer is one of her better builds. It could be better still though.

I offered nothing you say . <br><br>I offered a free +1 bonus to your AB between levels 29 and 33. Guess what all I did was to switch 2 feats round.

Granted this isnt a big bonus. It is however a simple improvement that is easy to implement. Why shouldnt you have X+2 AB at levels 29 30 and 31 you want to have every benefit you can get. <br><br>So where has it offered nothing. <br><br>My point and your point on Self concealment are both valid and its a matter of taste which you decide. I will even concede not taking it might leave you in a worse situation. <br><br>You cannot however say I offered nothing by switching the 2 feats round. Read the figures above , it speaks for itself. <br><br>As for tactics, its your build play it whatever way you like. As for anyone else wanting to play it can you seriously say they are going to turn round and say Tyrpaladin has a point Ill take epic prowess before Epic weapon focus and live with 1 less AB for 3 levels.

Maybe you should switch the last AA-lvl for a monk, like this:<br><br>9 Monk<br>1 Wizard<br>29 Arcane Archer<br>1 Monk<br><br>In that way you can max out tumble and discipline. Remove Heal and lower something else for that. You can also remove 2 Arcane Archers and add 2 monk, you will lose 1 AB, but you will get higher speed, Spell Resistance 22 (Dont know if that is enough though)and immunity against deseases (Then you dont need heal).

What's really sad is that every month or so I read this thread because of a new post. Then I have to work my way through all the vitriolic Tyr-mail in the middle to try to learn something from those who attempted to improve this build.<br><br>Could one of the administrators snip out all the hateful replies in the thread? Or maybe it needs to be removed completely - there is another monk-&gt;AA build (Iron Pesky Mosquito 15 Monk/2 Wiz/23 AA) in the build list.<br><br>It's simply amazing how much bitterness and hostility some people carry around with them.<br><br>Thanks to everyone here who contributes and aids others.<br>Kaliban<br><br>PS - Can't we all just get along?  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">

Hehe she did piss a lot of people off, including myself. If you had seen some of the pms she sent, you would know exactly why she is no longer a memer of the official Bioware community.

To true Xitooner. She did come up with a lot of interesting ideas, but as soon as you pointed out the flows in some of those ideas or tweaks to imporved them, the veritable *** storm commenced.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

One question, where is the damage going to come from in this build?  If the place its used has no DR or Soak items you will do fine with the 15 pts from the AA class.  But any good Barb / DD with the DR feats will ignore you, and if the mod/PW/whatever has some good (20DR) items your going to be hard pressed to do more then just plink people a few times with 1D8+15(aa)+6(mighty?) damage.  That gives you a range of 22-29 damage per hit.... ouch if your facing any kind of mid or good level of DR.

No Mighty for this character - you have to have STR bonuses to get the Mighty damage.<br><br>That leaves arrows to get your extra damage, which is why I prefer Bard7/RDD10/AA23. Start with an Elf and for the cost of one Great Strength you can get STR25 and still have 30 DEX. Plus you get maxed Tumble, Spellcraft, UMD, the Bard song and some useful spells. <br><br>More an attacking AA than a defending one...

I very much like this build, everyone who argued the points about self con epic dodge ect ect... i don't want to argue.......<br><br>I'd simply like to ask if somebody could tell me how to adapt the build to get epic dodge and the 5th self conceal level. I'm not very good at builds and I'm guessing its quite a minor shift of feats, if someone could please point me in the direction it would be very much apreciated. <br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  thanks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">
