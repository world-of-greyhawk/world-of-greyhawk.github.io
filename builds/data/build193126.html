Extra turning, great cleave, and blind fighting, aren't really that useful for this build. You should take more CoT levels post epic since you can use its bonus feats for epic feats like Great Wisdom. You can also substitute Paladin for Fighter to get more feats as well as weapon specialization.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Giantevilhead on 05/01/05 23:21</span></i></p>

Since you arent here, then its not necessary, cleave will work just fine.<br><br>Blind fight, i have never used it, but it does sound like it has its uses, and it is a personal thing.<br><br>Extra turning though is ABSOLUTELY necessary, because the build is using divine might AND shield (lots of turns needed).  The one thing that hurts the build though is that you will only have 22 charisma, which, imho is too low to really use the divine feats.  What i mean is that you end up making a mediocre character instead of a great character.<br><br>I like the use of paladin, and i agree with the suggestion that cot should be taken post epic, lv 22-31ish.  Why?  As suggested, to take great wisdom feats.  You should really take 10 charisma to get that stat higher (it benefits saves, damage, ac) and take 4 cot bonus feats as great wisdom.  <br><br>I am not sure why you took quicken and autoquicken 3!  That's 4 feats that could be used to add to charisma (great charisma), and if you wanted to get wisdom to 20, you could take the 2nd cleric bonus feat as wis 5, with the first one as Armor skin.  <br><br>The thing you should keep in mind is that when using paladin and cot, with the divine feats charisma is your BEST friend.  You can get the saves tremendously high vs what you have, by pumping that stat.  THe other thing to make it more melee friendly is to take epic prowess and epic wpn focus early on 21/24.  <br><br>So, since you asked for some tweaks, here it goes: lv 1-4 paladin, 5-21 cleric, 22-31 cot, 32-40 cleric.  The only difficulty with this is that you wont have access to lv 7 spells til after lv 23, but you should still have the 4 attacks per round.  THe higher charisma will make this a ton tougher overall, especially when or if you get dispelled.  Oh, and you will have an amazin turn, relatively speaking!  LOL <br><br>Oh, i just noticed, and it is more of a rp issue.. with a dex of 8, would tumble be the best choice of feats?  A dex of 8 means that, overall, the character is clumsy, so how do you roleplay a tumble out of harms way?  I only suggest this cuz i was gonna create a similar pc for a rp server and decided that it would be better to focus on say, taunt or spot.  (if you take taunt, go 16cleric/4 paladin pre epic.. or even 16/3p/1cot with a paladin lv at 40 to max out taunt. Then the high charisma has another use  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   )<br><br>Hope i helped<br><br>Peace

Roleplaying a tumble ac... <br>Ever watch a Jackie Chan movie?  He tends to duck and weave in a clumsy kind of way.. falling over a branch to avoid a knife, or stumbling over a stone to avoid a kick.. I see tumble with low dex as much easier to roleplay than a highdex high tumble.
