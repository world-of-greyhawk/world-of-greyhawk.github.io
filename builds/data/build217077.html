Hello all. This is nothing new I guess but I havent seen it posted. This is a character I used in single player when I wanted to see if having many feats and then some can be good. Inspiration came from <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "127375", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> and <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "201215", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> which are similar to this one but still different enough for me to post.<br>I made him Dwarven as I think they make for the best fighters but if you want to be something else thats fine. No feat starvation here.

Wouldn't bother going unarmed unless with 16 levels of monk at least for their full unarmed damage (not sure about the level for unarmed damage improvements). BTW taking more monk is nice. They get poison immunity level 11 and near diease immunity at level 5 and more importantly, Imp. Evasion at level 9 (and KD and IKD at level 6 freeing up 1 feat if you take it to 6). I understand trying to get as many somewhat useful feats as possible but get Imp. Evasion at least if you're using monk in a build.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

This character is not meant to fight unarmed. I just wrote it down as it is there. It is not a monk build really, a fighter build with tumble and evasion. Sacrificing one AB for the early monk goodies. Of course if you will only play it at level 40 then Monk 6 is better but I wanted KD earlier without taking more Monk pre epic.

Imp. evasion is far better for a big, lumbering armoured hulk than evasion <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    Come on, give in *grin* - you may just roll a 1. Also, freeing by freeing that feat, you can take exotic and use a Dwarven Waraxe <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

Well Imp evasion is good no doubt. But you want it before level 40, atleast the way I play. So that means maybe 11 monk levels instead of 4. I like to look at this as a fighterbuild with monk levels and not a monkbuild with fighter levels.<br>Anyway it is always tempting with monk levels, always a good feat a few levels away.

Even with 11 Monk levels, it's still about 3/4 fighter classes. Besides, with more monk levels, you can get tumble dumps earlier and more frequently.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:. Only those who have known darkness in<br>(OvO) their hearts will see the shadows in life...<br>(|__|)<br>..".."..

Yes and then alot of the feats from fighter levels are gone and I have a different build, not the one I wanted.

Interesting build though I too am a little surprised at 4 monk levels instead of 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6.<br><br>Level 4 monk doesn't benefit you... level 1 gets you cleave and evasion; level 2 gets you deflect arrows; level 3 gets you still mind.  Level 4 gets nothing but level 5 would get immunity to disease and level 6 would get knockdown and improved knockdown.<br><br>My suggestion on modifying that would be to go either 3 or 6 on the monk levels - with a strong hint towards 6 to free feats up.  <br><br>Also I think you might want to consider epic will instead of reflexes, your will save is above-average for a fighter but you're still very much in danger from death spells.<br><br>I'd suggest levelling like this -<br>1 Fighter<br>2 Monk<br>3-6 Fighter<br>7 monk<br>8-11 fighter/COT<br>12 monk<br>13-16 COT<br>17 monk<br>18-20 fighter/COT<br><br>This puts 4 monk levels pre-epic and gets you all the monk innate powers you originally had much earlier.  The AB is the same at level 20 (+19) as your original build.<br><br>Then take monk level 5 at 27 for a skill dump and disease immunity, and monk level 6 at 37 for a skill dump and your free KD/IKD feats.  That is putting them off a long time, but you're not a sneak-attacker, so the delay is the trade off for getting them free.  By taking away 2 fighter levels you lose one epic bonus feat but you're really feat-rich anyway (you're taking improved expertise at level 40, easily sacrificed).<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Well yeah hehe I dont know why I try to defend my level split. All ideas are of course good. The reasoning behind four levels was I wanted access to tumble and evasion and I wanted the +2 to saves that two monk levels give me pre epic. Then to use the tumble class skill I took one more monk at 27 and one at 37. So I went for playability throughout instad of max power at level 40. You are right about the epic will though, probably a better choice.

Well, for playability's sake the extra level makes sense as a skill dump level (especially since neither fighter 27 nor COT 11 would help you any beyond 2 extra hitpoints).  <br><br>But I'd consider the 6 level setup more playable - it gets you alot of the monk benefits earlier so you have them for more of your character's life, with more frequent skill dumps, at no cost in AB.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with the build, just giving my opinion on it.  I personally would also be willing to sacrifice 4 fighter levels to COT for extra save bonuses at the cost of a feat (lose 2 fighter gain 1 COT)... maybe dropping epic weapon spec in warhammer (since you probably only intend to use that on slash-resistant enemies).  But it comes down to personal preference... I don't feel that feats like Imp Power Attack are really that useful though.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

I levelled a similar char to monk10/fighter16/cot14 and it seemed better, I admit that hehe. I had to sacrifice EWF and EWS for the blunt weapon though if I still wanted str 32 and I switched Epic ref for Epic will, especially with Imp evasion this is better, probably otherwise too. Not as many feats but the best ones you can still get.<br>Well I guess you can move the levels around to suit you need, I think it is a good mix though for a general purpose fighter build, the monk/fighter/cot one.
