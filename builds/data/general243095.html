Why the hell must every Druid have either Dragonshape or Shifter levels? I have not seen a single build with Druid levels that is focussed on either the Druids raw spell power, or its melee component. Its always 'Look what I can turn into' or 'Rawr I'm breathing acid down your pants because'... Surely there is more to the Druid class, no?<br><br>Does anyone know any builds that don't focuss at all on Dragonshape or Shifter? I'm just curious if anyone has even looked at the class from a different perspective.

My <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "228407", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Nature's Wyrm</a> is a high lvl druid focusing on conjuration with the added value of DS, or the other way round depending how you look at it. The point is that if you are going heavy on druid as a caster you are automatically meeting the requisites for DS (high WIS and 14+ Druid lvls) and it would be plain silly not to get it.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?

I know, of course it is valuable... but I see so many builds that are entirely dedicated to the Dragonshape. Druids happen to be my favourite class, so thats probably why I'm fussy about it. Its just, they have alot of strengths... the Element Shapes can be used as well, they are quite good actually. It would be nice to see some versatility in the Druid builds. Perhaps one based on the Element Shape? I've actually been working on one but I play with 30 level cap so I figure it won't help anyone to post it. <br><br>...I know its stupid that I am so fussy, but I normally play on nothing but RP servers so sometimes I look at the build from the RP aspect as well. I just think it would be cool to RP as a Master of the Elements or something. Of course, its always nice to be a Dragon, there are alot of fun things with this class unrelated to Dragons. But as I said, this is just my stupid outlook because I have been exposed to RP and whatnot...<br><br>But now that I mentioned Element Shape:<br><br>For 30 levels, with no gear, shifted and buffed, would 60 AC and 50 AB be good? Hasted, Invisible, a baggillion layers of DR... (etc.)...decent?

My <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "219695", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Mystic Druid</a> build is designed around being a very playable druid who gets good use out of the elemental shapes and offensive magic, but also adds dragon shape in because, frankly, if you are an epic druid with a caster bent (ie, high wisdom), <i>not</i> getting dragon shape is pretty dumb.<br><br>The build has a few issues though - not everything works right with it the way one would assume.  You can drop the weapon focuses in unarmed, for example, because they are <i>still</i> not working when shifted.  And then easily fit in an Epic Spell Focus for Conjuration or, possibly, necromancy (either is a pretty good choice for a druid).<br><br>You can also fit in more wisdom, etc... some posters discuss various ways to modify the build that are beneficial - I considered posting a revision but the discussion seems to cover everything I'd have changed.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Cool, I am going to have to join that guild with the 30 level forum. I guess I will post my builds there concidering they are -ALL- level 30. <br><br>I suppose I will still come here concidering a few people ask for advice on level 30 builds, I think I could still contribute...maybe...barely <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">
