Haven't seen a build for one of these on the search engine and thought it may be an interesting build.<br><br>I quickly knocked one up in the character creator and discovered that divine might and divine shield both work whilst shifted. I forgot to test smite evil but I'm assuming it does as well.<br><br>And when shifted charisma is rarely overridden.<br><br>Anyone ever fancied a holy avenger wielding kobold? A Vampire paladin? An evil smiting dragon??<br><br>In the quick build I knocked up I managed to get a 16 cha and 28 wisdom, not quite enough for dragon shape but im sure it could be tinkered with. This was with 5 druid, 17 shifter and 18 paladin. so all shifter shapes except dragon, full paladin spells - and lots of them thanks to high wisdom.<br><br>It does involve one alignment shift - which may not be possible on all servers but is easily done on the server i play on - though it will cost a fair chunk of gold.<br><br>Anyway I'll try knocking up a proper build and see if i can get a decent charisma and all shifter shapes - the dragon paladin idea appeals, as does the holy iron golem, the righteous rakshasa and the holy undead <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  Once done i'll post it in the builds section.<br><br>I was really just wondering if anybody has done this before and whether it worked or not?

Way, way back (over 2 years ago) I did a paladin/druid/monk with dragonshape called <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117475", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Sir Smokesalot</a>.  You can take a look at it, it isn't great but it works. The problem is the high wisdom requirement coupled with the need for a high charisma.  If you only wanted divine might/divine shield you would be better off with a cleric (wisdom will give you a ton of spells and a good DC). <br>If you were going for a shifter and didn't care for high wisdom shapes, you could pump charisma all the way (Lala_Truthsayer tried this with a <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "185671", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>blackguard build</a>.)  Blackguard has the advantage of avoiding the alignment shift, but the paladin spells help more.  Thus, with enough levels the paladin would be the superior build.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Well, going dragon will be hard, you know, for the 30 WIS, but since focuses don't work shifted, you could take all the feats on Great WIS and be able to get to it, however, CHA won't be too high... I recall I once tried a some sort of trying to copy the Order of Jormundgandr adding Divine Might (Divine Shield will do nothing in dragon shape, Dodge AC is already capped)... the damage adds very well... problems with feats though, it's a hard combination. BTW as you can't get CHA from equipment in dragon shape, a Paladin buffs better CHA than a Cleric, kind of what made my try weak, Divine Might lasted too shortly.<br><br>Using Shifter can be cool, you don't need so much WIS and can take a lot of CHA... but I'm not good with shifters, I don't know all the shifts and stuff, I always prefered to take dragon shape only with druid and never went shifter... Shifter ehm, shifts, can use Divine Shield, only the dragon shape caps Dodge AC if I'm correct.<br><br>I'll be waiting for that build.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 05/30/06 04:11</span></i></p>

Cheers for the build ideas Mithdradates - quite like the blackguard one - but I like all those paladin spells - and the kobold with Holy Avenger idea is just funny...<br><br>Anyway I have had a play around and decided the Dragon form takes up too much wisdom and the other shapes would be much weaker in comparison - and i like to jump shapes a lot.<br><br>So i stopped at construct, saved a few feats and increased charisma instead.<br><br>the results can be seen here <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "242262", "0", "#1728630", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Construct would not be able to take advantage of the Holy Avenger since it is unarmed.<br><br>Outsider (Azer Chieftan and Rak) could use it, or Risen Lord could make a Holy Avenger Scythe.<br><br>A Paladin/Blackguard + Shifter could take Planar Turning (25 Wis and Cha needed) and be able to affect other Shifter builds in either Undead or Outsider shapes.<br><br>hmmm...  That could be a very usefull build indeed...

Just figured out the build behind a Planar Turning Shifter Paladin/Blackguard.  eek.  You have to give up soooo much to obtain the 25 25 req on that feat.  blah, not worth it.<br><br>But a regular Paladin/Blackguard Shifter is feasable.  Pumping up the Pa/Bg levels pre-epic to boost AB would be a good idea.<br><br>=====<br><br>I guess if someone wanted a Planar Turning Shifter they'd make a Cleric/Druid/Shifter, but that's a whole other build concept.
