Just a few hours after the Presale Toolset was available for download I started working on a CBC for NWN2. <br><br>Because of so many differences between NWN and NWN2 and because I wasn't really happy with many design decision I made when making the NWN1 CBC I've decided to create a new CBC2 from scratch instead of porting the NWN1 CBC to NWN2. Therefore (and because NWN2 isn't published yet and nearly all my knowledge comes from the presale toolset 2da files) at the moment the CBC2 contains much less functionality than the old CBC1. That will definitely change once I have NWN2 in my hands.<br><br>At first I just wanted to post some screenshots but then I thought that I could also upload an alpha version. After all the module builders have the toolset to play with but what about the character builders?<br><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=NWN2Other.Detail&amp;id=9" target="_blank">CharacterBuildCalculator for NWN2 (alpha version)</a><br><br>At the moment it waits for approval but it should be available for download in the next hours.<br><br>The version is alpha (or beta maybe) but most basic things should work fine.<br><br>Any feedback is appreciated.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&amp;id=6445" target="_blank">Customize Character override hak</a>: Modify/dye armor, cloak, ... change portrait, head, tail, wings, tattoos, hair/skin color, rename, glowing eyes... in game.

I never got around to using the first CBC. Perhaps I'll try this one.

If anyone can point me to the right direction where the NWN 2 stuff will be hosted. At this point, I am going to assume it will be hosted on Bioware's site. As for game itself... going to buy preorder tomorrow morning or afternoon for limited edition(I already have it reserved, just need to pay for whole thing).<br><br>As for my activity in this guild... I have been "lurking" but been busy with my job search and RL stuff... bleh, I rather be on my computer and playing NWN 2 all day when it comes out. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">  <br><br>Anyway, sorry for off post... lol. But on post, using the CBC is great tool for when you are not on computer with NWN installed.... gives you an general idea of how you would build your character once you get around to it... I definately will using it once a while when I get NWN 2 in my hand and installed.

Unfortunately that doesn't help with file size.<br><br>Btw a lot of old NWN1 bugs have made it into NWN2. The famous Weapon Spec. Club still requires no fighter levels but has to be taken on a fighter level. All the other Weapon Spec. feats require 4 fighter levels but now they can be taken by any class. Poor old club, perhaps the first weapon, already used by prehistoric men, it seems to be forgotten by NWN developers these days <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> .<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.Detail&amp;id=856" target="_blank">Character Build Calculator</a>(works with Excel, Open Office) 2.83: updated to NWN 1.69.

Since you've looked through the 2da's, were you able to decipher where the spell durations are located?<br><br>So much of my spell caster builds depend on spell duration, especially since most of them were shortened.<br><br>As a side note, thanks for time and effort that has gone into the character build spreadsheet. <br>I've been told that if I ever developed super powers, I'd be called Spreadsheet Man (I know, kindof lame), so I really appreciate a well built spreadsheet when I run across one.
