I'd like to see if it could be done, myself.  On the server I play on, there are a good selection of whips, but typically they have the same enhanced stats as any sword or dagger, etc.  So, no real benefit.. but if you could make a class to benefit from the whip... heck that would be a challenge.<br><br>I'm guessing but it would probably need high dex + high ac to last the fight?  hmm... prolly rogue/wm/fighter?<br><br>I'd be keen to see what can be done!

I just couldn't resist posting the link to this old topic. "The stupid showoff" is a whip character. Maybe not quite what you had in mind, but nevertheless... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br><a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=330045&amp;forum=42&amp;sp=15" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br>Before you read the whole thread I'll have to issue a health warning!!!<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

I think a fighter/WM/rogue might be better.  Using rogue means that at least against enemies not immune to sneaks, you won't be stuck with the pitiful damage a whip gives you.<br><br>Steve

Question on disarm:<br><br>I made a gal with a whip. I may need to play around a little more but...<br><br>I cannot see disarm working. How does this function? I click on "disarm" and target the enemy but he does not lose his weapon. I seem to "hit" every time I attempt to disarm and one or two times, he "resists". But the times that I do hit, the weapon never leaves his hand. <br><br>My whip char has 30 lvls of assassin and his first attack is disarm from hiding in shadows which performs a "disarm" attack combined with a "death attack". So the guy gets paralyzed as well when the disarm attempt occurs. <br><br>Shouldn't his weapon be on the ground?<br><br><br>Edit: 2nd question. Do criticals include sneak or death attack damage before they are multiplied? for instance, if you do 40 HP of sneak attack damage and roll a crit with a x3 crit weapon, would you get 120 hp of damage or just the 40 sneak damage.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Banshe on 04/18/05 11:11</span></i></p>

For disarm, is it a PC or NPC?<br><br>If it's a PC maybe your server scripted it so the disarmed weapon goes right back into that chars inventory... cuts down on people disarming and stealing your items.<br><br>If it is a NPC, the item they have could be checked as an undroppable item... which should send it back to the inventory of the NPC... this also cuts down on stealing the uber NPC weapons and using/selling them.<br><br>If it's none of these, then I'm not sure.<br><br>Brandon
