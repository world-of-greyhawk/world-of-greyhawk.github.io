The Adroit Adept is very good at two things; high unbuffed AC, and spellcasting.  The AC is accomplished via the interesting fact that a pre-epic Duelist gets a point of AC for every Intelligence modifier, but the Epic Duelist gets DOUBLE that.  The AC given is Dodge AC.<br><br>So by concentrating on Int, this build maximizes Wizard spells and AC at the same time, much like a Monk/Cleric build can.   But this build doesnt stop there; it has the Expertise feats, 3 stats it can buff to raise AC (Dex,Int,Wis), and even can use a shield should the need arise. <br><br>And for the Wizard aspect, we've got:<br>- All Spell Pen feats, plus the PRC "Focused Spell Pen"<br>- All Spell Focus feats in your chosen school.<br>- the PRC "Practised caster" feat, to increase your casting levels by 4.<br>- Epic Skill Focus in Lore and Spellcraft; allowing the casting of 6 Epic spells/day.<br>- Epic Skill Focus in Discipline, just to make sure Knockdown doesnt happen much.<br><br>On the down side, he cant hit the broad side of a barn. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br><br>"Adroit Adept"  Elf  26/13/1 Wizard Duelist Monk<br>Lawful Neutral<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 16<br>Con 10<br>Wis 10<br>Int 18 (28)<br>Cha 8<br><br>1 Wizard  - Dodge<br>2 Wizard<br>3 Wizard - Extend Spell<br>4 Wizard Int19<br>5 Wizard5 - Craft Wand<br>6 Wizard - Maximize Spell<br>7 Wizard<br>8 Wizard Int20 <br>9 Wizard  Mobility<br>10 Wizard10 - Spell Pen<br>11 Wizard<br>12 Wizard - Int21 Ambidexterity<br>13 Duelist    &lt;&lt; Duelist Int AC Bonus  AC=21<br>14 Duelist<br>15 Duelist - Expertise<br>16 Duelist Int22<br>17 Duelist<br>18 Duelist - Practised Spellcaster (Wizard)<br>19 Duelist<br>20 Duelist Int23<br><br>BAB=14    3 attacks/round. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br> <br>21 Duelist  - Greater Spell Pen<br>22 Wizard    &lt;&lt; Max Concen, Spellcraft, Lore<br>23 Duelist<br>24 Duelist  Int24   ImpExpertise  &lt;&lt; Epic Duelist = Extra Int AC Bonus   AC=32<br>25 Wizard<br>26 Wizard15   Spell Focus (School)<br>27 Wizard  Epic Skill Focus (Spellcraft)<br>28 Duelist Int25<br>29 Wizard<br>30 Wizard  - Epic Skill Focus(Lore) <br>31 Wizard <br>32 Wizard20 Int26  Greater Spell Focus (school)<br>33 Duelist13  - ArmorSkin, Shield Proficiency<br>34 Wizard <br>35 Wizard <br>36 Wizard23  Int27  Epic Spell Focus(School), Epic Spell Pen<br>37 Wizard <br>38 Wizard<br>39 Monk Epic Skill Focus(Discipline)<br>40 Wizard  Int28 Focused Spell Penetration(School)<br><br>Ubuffed ACs<br>------------------<br>AC 41 naked   (30 Int via feats would have been 43)<br>AC 51 ImpExpertise<br>AC 54 ImpExpertise and Tower Shield (wont be casting, but allows extra AC bonuses, useful when out of spells)<br><br>AC can be inced +6 more via Wisdom items, and 1-2 more from Great Wisdom<br>AC can be inced +6 more via Dexterity items, and 1-2 more from buffing spells<br>AC can be inced +2 more via Int items or buffing spells (30 Int is max Dodge bonus, no more)<br>Note that Haste will not add AC bonuses once max Dodge bonus is reached.<br><br>AB <br>------------<br>Rapier  Crit (18-20x2)<br>AB 24/19/14<br>Damage d6 + 2d6 Slashing<br><br>Not bad damage, but the AB is horrible!

Other versions of the theme:<br>Wiz/EK/Duelist   <br>Wiz/Archmage/Duelist <br>Wiz/Duelist/BladeSinger  &lt;&lt;-- Mediocre; the BSingers Int AC benefits are Dodge too, so you max out early.<br><br>I think melee was a lost cause for this build in any normal way, so I didnt even try to enhance AB.   Instead, just learn the Epic Spell "DeadEye Sense", which grants +20 to AB for 20 Hours, and use it in emergencies. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Other Epic Spells besides DeadEye Sense to look into:<br>- Greater Timestop - 3 rounds of TimeStop at once.<br>- Battle Bounding - auto-teleports moves caster if any enemy gets close.<br>- Epic Warding - you know it. . . <br><br>PS: I would love to hear others opinions on the best Fort, Reflex, and Will-save Epic spells that can be gotten with a Spellcraft of 70 or below. . . <br><br>If ImpExpertise doesnt work with casting in your PW, consider swapping those feats out for Combat Casting and Imp Combat Casting.  Or use Defensive Casting, and get 2 free feats. <br><br><br>Pros<br>------<br>- High, high AC (as high as Undead Lord, who is in Plate Mail with Tower Shield).<br>- A fairly powerful spellcaster.<br><br>Cons<br>-----<br>- No melee to speak of.<br>- Weak Fort and Will saves; use Epic spells and buffs to keep safe.<br>_________________<br>Normal kids play rock-paper-scissors.<br>Shifter kids play IronGolem-RustMonster-MindFlayer. . .<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By xitooner on 09/01/04 03:05</span></i></p>

A little note: I *think* I changed the Bladesinger to Shield AC, but I'm not certain, for 2.2. Reason for this is a Bladesinger can't wield a shield, so its an either or thing. If it works, you can get up to 40 AC from a Bladesinger/Duelist combo (need 20 BS levels though). Munchkin, anyone? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.nwnprc.com" target="_blank">Player Resource Consortium</a>
