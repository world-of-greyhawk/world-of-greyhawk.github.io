The concept of the build was to create an undispellable caster (umm…let’s forget about Mord Disjunction for a while, ok? Thanks!), who has good spell potential, and can stand his ground in a fight. The result is the Champion of Archons. I hope I get comments and ideas about what should I change in the build to make it better.<br><br>I introduce you the<br><br><b>Champion of Archons</b><br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Any lawful<br>Playable: 1-40 PvM<br>Classes: Cleric 35 / Fighter 2 / Monk 3<br>Hit points: 484 base / 564 self-buffed / 724 max possible<br><br><b>Similar builds: </b><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "230230", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Faith Protector (Cleric 32 / Fighter 4 / Monk 4) - Grimnir77</a><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117465", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Divine Archer (Monk 4 / Fighter 4 / Cleric 32) – Kreiger</a><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "249806", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Limburger Cleric (Cleric 30 / Fighter 4 / Monk 6) – Mithdradates</a><br><br><br><b>Attributes: </b><br><br>Str 8<br>Dex 14<br>Con 16<br>Wis 16 (36)<br>Int 12<br>Cha 8<br><br><b>Level guide: </b><br><br>01: Fighter(1): Toughness, Weapon Focus: Longbow, Blind Fight<br>02: Cleric(1) [Domains: Trickery and 1.

But be aware of the fact that IE can only be used with melee weapons equipped! If you want to be the tank of the party, you cannot attack with your bow.

You don't get Wisdom AC till that!<br><br><b>A: </b> By taking the first Monk level pre-epic, I would lose 1 AB in the end. If you feel you can't wait till lvl 21, then take a Monk lvl pre-epic, 1 AB is the only loss. <br><br><br><b>Q: </b>Why don't you take 4 Fighter levels pre-epic? 4 attacks per round and Weapon Specialization!<br><br><b>A: </b>By having 4 Fighter levels, the build loses a cleric bonus feat and much AB! Think of it: while a Cleric 16/Fighter 4 character has 16 BAB and an attack schedule of +20/+15/+10/+5 with Divine Power, this Cleric 19/Fighter 1 has 15 BAB and an attack schedule of +20/+15/+10/+20. (If you need an explanation, go to <a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Divine_power" target="_blank">Divine Power at NWNWiki</a>)<br>Yes, I lose Weapon Specialization and even EWS, but to tell the truth, I don't think that +6 dmg/hit can change the battle.<br><br><br><b>*Important AB note! </b><br><br>I had a little argument with the game engine. Sadly, it wins all the time, but I don’t know why! Hope somebody can explain it.<br>It’s about the AB of the bonus attacks. I have 3 apr at +65/+60/+55. Now, Divine Power should give another attack at +65, Haste should give another attack at +65 and Rapid Shot should give another attack at +65! Instead, I get +65/+60/+55/+65/+60/+55! Any ideas?<br><br>Lastly, an advice in pre-epic levels: use Full plate mail! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Awaiting your comments! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Praetor<br><br><br><i>Edit: edited broken links</i><br>_________________<br>"I will be the last...and you will go first!"<br>Sarevok, Child of Bhaal<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Praetor_Ghastkill on 08/17/08 21:16</span></i></p>

At first glance, it looks pretty solid. Zen Archery is a good route with all that WIS. That low STR makes me cringe though.

I don't know if it was intended, but extra attacks from sources such as Divine Power, Haste, Rapid Shot, Flurry of Blows, etc now follow the -5 iterative progression.

I agree totally with cinn on stat distribution.  Infact, i think he is being alittle to easy on you!  LOL  <br><br>Think of it this way: you are a Cleric Bower.  What on earth do you need 16 con for?  Clerics have con buff spells.  With II, you have 50% concealment (or whatever you care to call it).  AND you are using a Bow.  How many Bowers are in the front lines?  This means that you could lower con to 10!  Boost str to 12, move dex to 12 (if you decided to do the plate thing) and bump wisdom to 18.  This would get you to 38 wis or 50 buffed fully.  I play clerics exclusively, and this is how i would play the stats.  <br><br>The other thing to consider is, do you really need 12 int?  LOL I know for some skills rule, but clerics need only concentrate and...  no epic spells, so no lore, no spellcraft (unless that is important to you).  Taking monk means tumble is an option.  How important is dis to a ranger?  Again, i may be min/maxing ALOT but as a human at int 10 you get 3 per cleric lvl, meaning you can max con, tumble and spellcraft or lore or dis.  The way i play (which is alittle aggressive me thinks) that is all i would need (UNLESS it was PRC, which changes everything (lore and spellcraft would be very important then i would need 12 to max 4 skills).<br><br>Oh, sorry mate about the ab question.  When i look at unbuffed stats, which i have for years now, i have NEVER seen owl's insight as unbuffed.  The last i remember it is a spell, which is a buff.  It would have been much less confusing to my new parent brain (my child is now 15 days old) to have said, unbuffed is 41.  +12 wis buffed fully is 67!  Listing each spell always makes me suspicious that he builder is trying to hide something behind the numbers!  LOL   Thats just me though<br><br>Peace<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/08/06 16:20:00 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I think avado answered your question like no other could... </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Infact, i think he is being alittle to easy on you!  LOL  <br><br>Think of it this way: you are a Cleric Bower.  What on earth do you need 16 con for?  Clerics have con buff spells.  With II, you have 50% concealment (or whatever you care to call it).  AND you are using a Bow.  How many Bowers are in the front lines?  This means that you could lower con to 10!  Boost str to 12, move dex to 12 (if you decided to do the plate thing) and bump wisdom to 18.  This would get you to 38 wis or 50 buffed fully.  I play clerics exclusively, and this is how i would play the stats. </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --> <br><br>Certainly, lowering Con and raising Str is an option <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  I just said that I don't feel that I need that strength. Str/Con points can be changed without hurting the build. Though I wouldn't go for 18 Wis - I just feel that 6 points for a +1 modifier is too much for me. If I think of what is better: 18 Wis + 10 Con or 16 Wis + 14 Con + 2 points leftover, I vote for the latter <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br> <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;The other thing to consider is, do you really need 12 int?  LOL I know for some skills rule, but clerics need only concentrate and...  no epic spells, so no lore, no spellcraft (unless that is important to you).  Taking monk means tumble is an option.  How important is dis to a ranger?  Again, i may be min/maxing ALOT but as a human at int 10 you get 3 per cleric lvl, meaning you can max con, tumble and spellcraft or lore or dis.  The way i play (which is alittle aggressive me thinks) that is all i would need (UNLESS it was PRC, which changes everything (lore and spellcraft would be very important then i would need 12 to max 4 skills).</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Hmm...I think you are right about that. He was started as an IE version before I found out that IE only works with melee weapons, and at this point I only lowered Int by 2 automatically. This build has enough AC in my opinion, so it something hits you, you can't do much with a 41 discipline in most cases.<br><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Oh, sorry mate about the ab question.  When i look at unbuffed stats, which i have for years now, i have NEVER seen owl's insight as unbuffed.  The last i remember it is a spell, which is a buff.  It would have been much less confusing to my new parent brain (my child is now 15 days old) to have said, unbuffed is 41.  +12 wis buffed fully is 67!  Listing each spell always makes me suspicious that he builder is trying to hide something behind the numbers!  LOL   Thats just me though<br>Peace</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>When I'm creating a build, I always think that way too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  But now I split it into three: the unbuffed ab (41), the self-buffed ab (58) and the max possible ab (67). I think it is good to know how much AC/AB can a character get without uber stuff, relying only on himself.<br>_________________<br>"I will be the last...and you will go first!"<br>Sarevok, Child of Bhaal

You do link my<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "230230", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Faith Protector</a> which is almost exactly like your build. The epic feats f.ex. is an exact match. That proves great minds think alike I guess. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  The only difference is that I use my little weapon feats for melee (but still take zen), and use other domains. And a little difference in stat spread. +1 to Wis in this build might seem to costly, but it gives more spells, +1 DC, +1 AB, +1 Will, +1 AC.<br><br>Also, you'll never be wearing full plate with an 8 STR. I had 10, + empower spell and that was barely enough. DP grants 18 STR, true, but then you need someone to carry the plate+tower around for you. My advice is to rather hang back and use bow + summons or spells rather than pain yourself on plate pre-epic. Other than pre-epic playability I agree with you.<br><br>Nice build, off course. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again
