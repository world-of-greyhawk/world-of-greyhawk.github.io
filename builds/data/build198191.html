<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>I wanted to make a build that focused heavily on buffing and melee fighting. This is it. I found it quite fun to play in the OC, SoU and HotU, I have no idea how it would do in PvP, though I tried to put some thought into that when making the build. Any helpful comments would be appreciated, it's the first build I've posted so there's probably room for improvement.<br><br><b>starting stats</b><br>str  14<br>dex  14<br>con  14<br>wis  8<br>int  14<br>cha  14<br><br><b>1</b>  sorc 1  power attack,  cleave  <br><b>2</b>  sorc 2  <br><b>3</b>  figh 1  toughness,  two weapon fighting  <br><b>4</b>  figh 2  ambidexterity  (+dex)<br><b>5</b>  figh 3  <br><b>6</b>  RDD 1  w prof exotic  <br><b>7</b>  RDD 2  <br><b>8</b>  RDD 3  (+str)<br><b>9</b>  RDD 4  great cleave  <br><b>10</b>  RDD 5  <br><b>11</b>  RDD 6  <br><b>12</b>  RDD 7  imp two weapon fighting  (+str)<br><b>13</b>  RDD 8  <br><b>14</b>  RDD 9  <br><b>15</b>  RDD 10  blind fight  <br><b>16</b>  figh 4  imp crit(kukri)  (+str)<br><b>17</b>  figh 5  <br><b>18</b>  figh 6  w focus(kukri),  w spec(kukri)  <br><b>19</b>  figh 7  <br><b>20</b>  figh 8  knockdown  (+con)<br><b>21</b>  sorc 3  overw crit(kukri)  <br><b>22</b>  sorc 4  <br><b>23</b>  sorc 5  <br><b>24</b>  sorc 6  dev crit(kukri)  (+con)<br><b>25</b>  sorc 7  <br><b>26</b>  sorc 8  <br><b>27</b>  sorc 9  max spell  <br><b>28</b>  sorc 10  (+cha)<br><b>29</b>  sorc 11  <br><b>30</b>  sorc 12  extend spell  <br><b>31</b>  sorc 13  <br><b>32</b>  sorc 14  (+cha)<br><b>33</b>  sorc 15  epic weapon focus  <br><b>34</b>  sorc 16  <br><b>35</b>  sorc 17  <br><b>36</b>  sorc 18  imp knockdown  (+cha)<br><b>37</b>  sorc 19  <br><b>38</b>  sorc 20  <br><b>39</b>  sorc 21  epic spell:epic warding  <br><b>40</b>  RDD 11  (+con)<br><br><b>final stats</b><br>str  25<br>dex  15<br>con  19<br>wis  8<br>int  16<br>cha  19<br><br><b>Key skills:</b> 43 concentration, 43 discipline, 42 spellcraft, 20 tumble<br>That leaves 73 points, I used them for 20 lore, 20 persuade, 20 craft armor, 13 craft weapon<br><br><b>Naked, unbuffed stats</b> (wielding normal kukri in both hands)<br>HP 460 (max)<br>AC 20<br>attack 34,29,24,19,34,29<br>damage 1-4 + 9 (15-20 x2), 1-4 + 5 (15-20 x2)<br>saves: (versus spells)<br>fortitude 27 (36)<br>reflex 17 (26)<br>will 21 (30)<br><br>Dev Crit at DC 37<br><br>Those are, admittedly, not very impressive stats.

I'm thinking about giving up knockdown and getting two more overwhelming criticals, any thoughts on that?

I would say that final stat point into CON isn't really doing anything for you, since it ends at 19. Leave your CON at 18 and put that final stat increase into STR. That gives you 26 STR for an exta +1 AB and damage.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

He would be considerably weaker (compared to other builds) on high magic worlds and so I've tried to aim for best performance without magic items.<br>That said, shifting a point of con into str (or str-&gt;con) would indeed be a good adaptation if you have greater access to magical items.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By pulse cap on 06/05/05 16:59</span></i></p>

Its a good build, really, I have been running some tests with it, and it seems so well planned. Of course it can be debuffed, but who cannot? The only thing I would like is EWS, but since removing Epic warding probably is out of the question, the only "expendable" feat I see is Toughness. Then the weighing. 8th fghtr lev into late epics to get EWS, +4 dmg for the cost of 40 hp and 1 AB. Well, dunno, but +4 dmg with your amount of attacks is quite a bit, especially when true striking. All your feats will be moved a space tho. But you have probably done this weighing, seeing how well planned the build is. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Losing 40 HP could be acceptable I think, but -1 BAB would mean one less attack, which would sting a bit. I've spent quite a while now looking over the build hoping to find another way to do it, but failed. Hopefully one of the master builders of the forum can help out with it.

OK, here's an idea. It sacrifices overwhelming and devastating criticals, which is bad, but dev crit is banned on many PWs anyway. Perhaps a bigger sacrifice is that you lose a lot of playability until the last level. Anyway, here it is:<br><br>Go for (sorc 4/figh 8/ RDD 8)  pre-epic.<br>Take another fighter level at a clvl where you get to choose a feat. Take one more RDD at lvl 21-38, preferably early to maximise skill points. Take the final RDD level on lvl 40. This makes (sorc 21/figh 9/RDD 10).<br><br>Much less playable at lvls 15-39, but it does get EWS without sacrificing any BAB. It will also free up another feat, as you drop both overwhelming and devastating critical while adding only EWS. Or you could drop two more feats for great str and still get overwhelming critical (req is 23 str if i remember correctly). If anyone is interested, I'll post a leveling chart with these changes.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By pulse cap on 07/03/05 21:52</span></i></p>

Well, the Dev. Crit version is, obviously, a lot better anywhere Dev. Crit isn't banned, because the feat is ridiculously overpowered.  If I were using it somewhere I didn't have Dev. Crit, though, that newer build looks mighty fine.

It stings a bit having to wait until lvl 40 to get the final RDD bonuses.

i hate dev crit, and dont even have one build with that included. But I really enjoy your build, but not taking dev crit really changes it to a bit different path. But i must say, this build really hit me. Good work!
