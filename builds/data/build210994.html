This build is based on the idea on a female assassin using the bard role as a cover to get access to her quarry.  When not on a contract, she can be a good support to an adventuring team and can generate adequate sneak damage.<br><br>Thanks to Christian.Schnabel and Stravinsky for their input.<br><br>Here is the current version.<br><br><b>playable from level 1 - 40 PvM</b><br><i>Also..very well suited for party play</i><br><br>Bard(8)/Shadowdancer(10)/Assassin(22)<br><br>Halfling, Female, N-E<br>	<br>Abilies	STR: 10<br>	DEX: 19 (32)<br>	CON: 10<br>	WIS: 8<br>	INT: 14<br>	CHA: 13<br><br>Raise Dex throughout<br><br>Level progression:<br><br>1 Bard(1): Dodge<br>2 Bard(2)<br>3 Bard(3): Weapon Finesse<br>4 Bard(4):<br>5 Bard(5)<br>6 Bard(6): Weapon Focus: Dagger<br>7 Bard(7)<br>8 Assassin(1)<br>9 Assassin(2): Mobility, (Uncanny Dodge I)<br>10 SD(1): (Hide in Plain Sight)<br>11 Assassin(3)<br>12 Assassin(4): Ambidexterity<br>13 Assassin(5)<br>14 Assassin(6)<br>15 Assassin(7): Two-Weapon Fighting<br>16 Assassin(8):<br>17 Shadowdancer(2):(Darkvision, Evasion)<br>18 Bard(8): Curse Song<br>19 SD(3)<br>20 SD(4)<br>21 SD(5): Epic Weapon Focus: Dagger, (Defensive Roll)<br>22 SD(6)<br>23 SD(7):(Slippery Mind)<br>24 SD(8): Great Dexterity I<br>25 SD(9)<br>26: SD(10): (Improved Evasion)<br>27: Assassin (9): Epic Dodge<br>28: Assassin(10)<br>29: Assassin(11)<br>30: Assassin(12): Great Dexterity II<br>31: Assassin(13)<br>32: Assassin(14): Great Dexterity III<br>33: Assassin(15): Self Concealment I<br>34: Assassin(16)<br>35: Assassin(17)<br>36: Assassin(18): Self Concealment II, Self Concealment III<br>37: Assassin(19)<br>38: Assassin(20)<br>39: Assassin(21): Self Concealment IV<br>40: Assassin(22): DEX+1, Self Concealment V<br>	<br>	<br>Statistics	<br><br>Hitpoints: 260<br>Skillpoints: 278<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 16/19/38<br>BAB: 25<br>AB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 38 (ranged, dual)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 30/32<br><br>Spell Casting: Bard(3)<br><br>Other Abilities:<br><br>Bard Song<br>Bardic Knowledge			<br>Use Poison		<br>Ghostly Visage		<br>Hide in Plain Sight				<br>Darkness				<br>Invisibility		<br>Darkvision (whatever it does?) <br>Evasion				<br>Shadow Daze <br>Summon Shadow		<br>Shadow Evade		<br>Defensive Roll		<br>Slippery Mind		<br>Improved Evasion <br>Uncanny Dodge I-III		<br>Improved Invisibility				<br>Posion Save I-VI<br><br>Skills:	<br>Disable Trap 43(45), Hide 43(54), Move Silently 43(56), Open Lock 37(48), Perform 14(15), Taunt 21(22), Tumble 40(54), UMD 39(40)<br>	<br>There is a lot of leeway with the skills.  Variations can be made as you see fit.<br><br>I put the last bard level a little later for a better and less costly taunt, but sacrificing the cost in other skills it can be cross-classed later on and the 8th bard level with its more potent song can be taken earlier.  I am not sure which is best, I guess it would depend on the PW you play.<br><br>The end-result seems more capable than I expected once you factor the bard/curse song, the bard/assassin/SD buffs and abilities, the Self-concealement and the sneak damage.  The saves are not really great however.<br><br>Human Version:<br><br>I have made a human version with KD.  You basically loose the Epic weapon specification for another Great Dex and the build is pretty much the same.<br><br><br><br>Comments are welcomed!<br><br><br>Drallimer<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 09/23/05 21:04</span></i></p>
