Just a few things I was wondering about, hopefully someone can answer them for me...<br><br>1. Does crippling strike stack? To what extent?<br>2. Does called shot stack? To what extent?<br>(most importantly here, I'm wondering if the -20% movement speed stacks or not.. dex would also be nice to know about)<br>3. Can you KD as an archer? (dumb question I'm guessing, but doesn't hurt to ask.. could be glitchy for all I know)<br>4. Can you use rapid shot in conjunction with called shot?<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

I could very easily be wrong:<br><br>1. I do not think it stack.  You could make a Mod with an NPC who has an insane AB and just stand there letting it sneak you over and over so you can test this for yourself, but I do not think that it does.<br><br>2.  Called Shot does stack, but it does not last long enough for it to really make a huge diffrence (it lasts a few rounds at best).  All aspects of it stack.<br><br>3.  Archers tend to be very easy to Knock Down (I assume KD is Knock Down).  The DC on Knockdown goes against one's Discipline check, which is a Strength Based Skill.  And unless you Multi-Class your Rogue to have something that gets Discipline, you will be an easy target to being Knocked Down.<br><br>4.  You can use Rapid Shot and Called Shot together, but you will get a large negative modifier towards yout attack bonus.  You go into the combat style of Rapid Shot (which, you can only be in one combat style at a time), then you go use the technic of Called Shot (You can only use one technic at a time).<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=381395&amp;forum=42" target="_blank">Click Here</a> for a Guide to Neverwinter Nights.

I believe he was asking if it is possible to use the knockdown feat with an archer. I'm not sure if it is possible to knock someone down with a ranged weapon but I'm thinking that it doesn't work.
