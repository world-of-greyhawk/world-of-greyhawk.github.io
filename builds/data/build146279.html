<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>The Out'rage'ous Sneak. This gal is built for sneak attack and being incredibly hard to hit.

The character should keep a good supply of Clarity potions and seek out anything that boosts the WILL save.<br><br>I know a lot of people would recommend FTR instead of Barbarian, but I have several reasons for not taking FTR:<br><br>1) I like the little boost of speed from the Barb - this could get you out of trouble a little easier in lower levels.<br><br>2) Rage 2x per day will adequately boost the damage output when sneak attacks are not an option.<br><br>3) Barbarian gets more skill points than the FTR.<br><br>4) Barbarian gives a few more HPs (no big deal, but a small bonus)<br><br>5) I wanted to try something a little different, so I nuked FTR in favor of Barb. Barb gives you the weapon proficiencies of the FTR, plus shields - no heavy armor, but the build doesn't require that anyway.<br><br>With SC V and Epic Dodge, this character is extremely hard to hit, so the lower HPs are not too big a concern. SD levels give you a (very weak) summon, but it could allow an extra couple of sneak attacks, which might make all the difference.<br><br>Anyway, that's it.

Cool build. I have been playing with my barb/roge lately as well. It's the 'Master of Scare Tactics' build. It varies slightly from yours in that it's more barbarian using terrifying rage in conjunction with sneak attacks, but it has the saem weaknesses you pointed out. What rogue feats are you taking? Slippery mind helps with those weak will saves that you pointed out too.

Shortswords do more damage , up to 4 more , and when a dex buld comes up against DR , then you need as much as you can get. <br><br>I also think it looks better. I always imagine them as more like 2 short curved swords/sabers that you can strap to your back in an x type shape  and draw them over your shoulder.<br><br>In fact if you look at the icon (you can see it in the manual in your docs folder) for shadowdancer you can actually see something similar being used.(page 21 hotu manual)<br><br>Syrath

I believe kukri's are exotic which would take an extra feat, perhaps that's why he chose not to use them.

heh i tried this build out earlier.. well, most of it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  i took all the feats , but got rid of the SC feats, and the race was halfling.. starting stats the same except instead of 10 intellegence you have 14... instead of 4 barb and 7 SD i took 8 fighter and 1 SD, using the extra feats to get armor skin to compensate, as well as epic weapon prof kukri, imp crit short and kukri, same with epic weapon focus in each and weapon specialization in short sword.. to dual weild as a halfling proficiently you need a small and tiny so thats why i took kukri in there.

There weren’t any Kukri’s in Cinnabar’s build, it is not an attack on C’s build (I like the build, it sounds cool :shades and fun), I was just curious why he chose short swords.   I am curious as to why Tilbono took feats for both Short swords and Kukri’s … that is a lot of extra feats to do both.  I am trying to learn more and discuss it with my fellow players.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By who_is_daniel on 08/19/04 16:43</span></i></p>

Yeah armor skin increases your AC by 2. <br><br>SC5 acts as a 50 percent damage reduction .<br><br>Epic dodge is most effective in a 1 on 1 situation where at its most effective (with SC5 and high AC) can turn a fight where you get hit once every 5 rounds into a fight where you get hit once every 266 rounds. This is as Im sure you can see a good bit more effective than armor skin. <br><br>Syrath

I like this build alot (AM A FAN OF THE ROUGISH ARTS) but i think i might take the FTR levels so that i could get some feets that boosts will saving to help counter the week will saves.

This could get you the two-weapon fighting feats easier and also a chance to boost your WILL saves (although Slippery Mind is supposed to help there, I've recently read it's bugged and doesn't work...), plus perhaps a shot at Weap. Spec. and the Epic version. From a power point of view, FTR is probably much more logical, but like I said, I wanted something a bit different.<br><br>Enjoy your character!<br>_________________<br>"Well, but you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just<br>'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!"

ACtually i did test the build lol, i didnt change the starting stats.. i used the same ones, but with halfling you have an extra 4 stat points to spare <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  (because to get the 18 dex its only +2 for each instead of +3)<br>I chose kukris AND shortswords simply.. because i can <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  the only difference is a possible extra 2 damage, you could just go pure kukri if you like, i said the armor skin compensates from the lack of +2 ac from the shadowdancer feat, not from lack of SC... depends if the server you got has improved invis scrolls, if not , then take the SC

Much clearer now. One thing to keep in mind is that Imp Invis can be dispelled and it has a limited duration, whereas SC can't be and doesn't...<br><br>Anyway, good luck with your build! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>"Well, but you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just<br>'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!"

I decided to try this build on a roleplay server.  Let me tell you, it went against my usual powergaming tendencies.  I ended up restarting the build 3 times.  I couldn't decide if I really wanted 18 dex as opposed to 17.  I had stats of 14,17,14,8,13,8 which I thought were pretty nice.. but I really wanted to be able to get the epic dodge later.. though on the mod I play getting epic is a... well epic task and I don't like planning for the longrun because realistically one wouldn't do that when they could do what benefits and allows them to survive the present.  I also had chosen fighter for the extra feats that were needed very much.  I wanted blindfight, toughness, and maybe weap spec... but..<br><br>I ended up keeping true to the build because it sounded more interesting to be a rog barbarian.  I also went Tiefling and chaotic evil.  So I am some crazy evil demon guy.  So far the 10% speed boost has saved me several times.  It's fun.  When I get my sd lvls it will be really fun <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I don't expect to dominate like my cleric/rog/ftr does, but thats OK.  I'll tell you all how it goes when I get to prolly about 10.. which will take me about a month or longer <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">
