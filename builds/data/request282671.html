I am starting this PC on a low magic, mainly PvM world and would like your input on it.

For those pesky Reflex based PCs, he has a nice DC 38 Will-based Stonehold as well. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"> <br><br>Please let me know what you think, and any possibilities on making him better.

Heh, well finding builds with those classes sure is hard, you normally pick Monk, my iconic Druid takes Assassin <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>I would take Focuses and Specialization on longbow if I were you, your WIS will make your ranged AB work good while your melee just sucks.<br><br>I would lower INT, for whatever else except CHA, you don't need Lore or Animal Empathy. I don't think your stealth is going to work on a caster, only a Shadowdancer can acomplish those tricks.<br><br>It's nice, not really much to add, casters are easy to build.<br>_________________<br>Join the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Pre-epic Character Builds</a> Guild for builds capped at level 20 and level 30.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 09/07/07 19:41</span></i></p>

Hmm, good points thanks Thax!<br><br>In reference to not using monk:  The server I am playing him on follows FR guidelines for Druids, Paladins and monks when it comes to multiclassing.  So if I took monk; I would have to keep my monk levels and Druid levels within 1 of each other. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By 4SakN on 09/07/07 19:44</span></i></p>

I like the idea of 6 f/ 32 d/ 2 assassin/sd instead.<br>The Cleric version of this would be 4/35/1Monk.<br><br>Pre-Epic: 4f/16d<br><br>A few factors which might change my opinion though:<br><br>What kinda of SR are you up against in PvM?<br><br>I'm not so sure you need penetration feats if its a low magic server. Unless you have tons of little monks running around.<br><br>How many of the spawns have freedom or paralysis immunity.<br><br>Certainly the sneak damage will make your build a little bit better when fighting stoneheld opponents, but what I found when playing a 38/1/1 variant was that your panther is much better at accomplishing this. I TOO did the Conj focus for stonehold/sov.  <br><br>I feel that higher caster lvl is more important as you really dont have much melee capability. Ice Storm damage is going to be key in your build. <br><br>As mentioned above you might want to consider going ranged. BUT I wouldn't go longbow w/o monk lvls for AC, so what I propose is going with Throwing Axes and a tower shield, Zen Archery.<br><br>Edit:<br>You should definatly drop to 14 INT, 8 DEX, 8 STR and max WIS to 18 and CON to 14 for starters. Extended AoV will get you to 12 Dex. You don't need STR for AB anymore. Only take 16 INT on Clerics. Your higher WIS will up your DC's. Plus you get another Epic Druid feat at lvl 32. <br>I am going to look into this a little bit more. And try to build a few different versions to see what I think you might be looking for.... It really isn't the same without Monk and Divine power but..... Your AB really won't matter much if your stonehold and sov can keep them flatfooted...   bbl..<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By SKIPPNUTTZ on 09/07/07 20:42</span></i></p>

Is it a +5 world?<br>(+5 AC items/weapons)<br><br>I would also suggest taking Combat Casting/Imp Combat Casting unless you are like me and hotkey Defensive Casting mode to F1 and use it whenever you stop to cast.<br><br>Plus, I haven't really worked out a spellbook for the build but... generally you would benefit more from taking Maximize Spell so that you get better average damage from Ice Storms. IMHO.<br><br>From going with 14 INT instead of 16, you can drop the 41 lore points. BUT contrary to the post about not taking Animal Empathy, I strongly suggest it in a PW PvM setting. It is just uber if you can find some spawns that are better than you summons. Combine a possessed spawn and your panther, you will demolish stoneheld/stunned foes with ease <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      <br><br>On my version I did just that, except I shifted into panther and used flurry, used my familiar panther, and an uber Cow that is really nasty on the PW I played it on. Between the three of us, we were quite nasty!<br><br>I am thinking of dropping the toughness and luck of heros for PBS and Rapid shot. With your WIS bonus, BAB, and WF feats, you might just actually be capable of killing stuff with your axes &gt;.&lt;<br><br>I will post a build for you to try out after I finish planning it in this spreadsheet.<br><br>P.S. could you look into Throwing Axe availablility on this server of yours? Maybe a sling? wOOt.. <br><br>I love slings because like, nobody uses them !! And it is so much easier to carry mass amounts of ammo. But.. I imagine you have bags on your server so... teh T.A.'s would be better. just quickslot the stacks to equip new ones.<br><br>From the lack of rogue levels you are going to lose your Move Silently ranks as well, BUT since you are ranged, listen/ms are not that important. You can junk out some concentration too if you use defensive casting mode. Plus I am not so sure that that discipline is going to help you much unless the spawns on your mod have a real low ab. Could you verify that please.<br><br>Oh uhmmm. are Scabbards of Blessing an easy find for characters on your server? <br><br>If not do you have access to bless/aid potions?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By SKIPPNUTTZ on 09/07/07 21:14</span></i></p>

You might also want to consider trading in that Point Blank/ Rapid Shot alternative for improve Expertise, given your server doesn't use the module switch to override casting spells with it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Wow, thanks for the input bud.  I can't address all of this right now; but I will later on.<br><br>Just a couple quick ones though if you want to work on it a bit (And I do appreciate it! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   ):<br><br>- He will have to be true Neutral, so Assassin is out. as I said I am working on the "Iconic" Druid. He adheres to his oaths, and cares nothing about Law or chaos; only maintaining the balance and defending his woods.  Originally a druid cannot even be anything but Neutral <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>- It is a very low magic server:  +1 gear is hard to find below level 8-12; and +2 will only be gained on DM events. Scabbards of blessing are actually easily obtained though.<br><br>- Only usable gear is Druidic.  He cannot use a longbow; or plate mail etc.  If he ever does so he loses his ability to advance as a Druid (scripted to check on level-up)<br><br>-  If you want to use any Prestige classes instead; here are the rules on them:  Must take a minimum 5 levels of a prestige class if you start.  Cannot take more than one PrC (I can bend this, but it would have to be Justifiable for the PC).<br><br>- My goal was an all around Defender of the woodlands; Wise old man focused on casting; but not gimped in Melee (I know I didn't quite reach it, hence asking for help <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   )  A kind of Gandalf type figure.<br><br> I do want to keep Animal Empathy regardless, just to fit the RP; because he should be master over any animals in his domain.  If a caster summons an animal on him, I want to be able to dominate it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">   <br><br>I'll try to address more later, but I gotta run for now.
