<b>Playable From Level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>Standing on the rooftop you chuckle to yourself. Not the hearty laugh of someone who has just heard a joke told, but the cynical laugh of one who has seen too much.<br><br>Killing, that is your skill and your trade. You remember back to better times, times where most chuckles were not cynical. You had friends then. A ranked scout in the army, you did quite well for yourself. That all changed when you were approached by the Shadow Infantry. An elite commando unit famed for its almost magical stealth abilities. It was here that you met Red (everyone just became known by their nickname, real names were kept secret). She was your mentor, your superior officer, and your lover. <br><br>Your skills proved to be exceptional within the unit. It was on a standard mission that the biggest change to your life would come. Tracking down brigands upcountry it wasnt unusual for the squads to split up and move on solo communicating only by making animal sounds. <br><br>You eventually came across the enemies camp, just in time to see a helmeted black knight execute Red. Outnumbered you had no choice but to just sit there. You stayed and watched the camp all night. They broke up shortly after dawn. You took the time to bury Red's tortured and limp body before you set to tracking them. <br><br>You eventually caught one of them and managed to get a name out of him , not for your Mentor's killer but for the leader of this particular camp. Resigning your commission in the army , you set about training for revenge. Almost exactly 10 months later and an equal <br>number of assassinations you finally tracked down Red's killer, a rich noble who was in fact secretly running the local brigands. With no evidence there was no way you could take him to justice. You bid your time until the time was right. His death was slow, you made sure of that, cutting his inside thigh you sat and watched as he bled to death. When asked why , you just said "For Red".<br><br>You have lost count how many souls you have sent to void since then. It is what you do , it is what you are good at. Why be anything else. <br><br>Still you cant help but wish the path you travelled had not been so bathed in blood.<br><br>The Tormented Assassin<br><br>STR 10<br>DEX 18 (32)<br>CON 14<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8<br><br>Human - Lawful Evil (originally Lawful Neutral) Striving for Lawful Neutral once more<br>Rogue 8/ Shadowdancer 10/ Assassin 22<br><br>1/ Rogue Dodge Mobility<br>2/ Rogue<br>3/ Rogue Weapon Finesse<br>4/ Rogue<br>5/ Rogue<br>6/ Rogue Ambidexterity<br>7/ Rogue<br>8/ Rogue<br>9/ Shadowdancer Two Weapon Fighting<br>10 Shadowdancer<br>11 Shadowdancer <br>12 Shadowdancer Improved 2 Weapon Fighting<br>13 Shadowdancer<br>14 Shadowdancer<br>15 Shadowdancer Improved Critical<br>16 Shadowdancer<br>17 Assassin<br>18 Assassin Improved Initiative<br>19 Assassin<br>20 Assassin<br>21 Shadowdancer Great DEX 1<br>22 Shadowdancer <br>23 Assassin <br>24 Assassin Epic Dodge <br>25 Assassin<br>26 Assassin<br>27 Assassin Great DEX 2<br>28 Assassin <br>29 Assassin<br>30 Assassin Great DEX 3<br>31 Assassin<br>32 Assassin * Great DEX 4 <br>33 Assassin Self Concealment 1<br>34 Assassin<br>35 Assassin <br>36 Assassin * Self concealment 2 /3 <br>37 Assassin<br>38 Assassin <br>39 Assassin Self Concealment 4<br>40 Assassin * Self Concealment 5<br><br>Disable Trap 20<br>Hide 43<br>Listen 43<br>Move Silently 43<br>Open Lock 10<br>Search 43<br>Tumble 40<br>Spellcraft 20<br>Use Magic Device 35 <br><br>Main hand AB +34/+29/+24<br>Off Hand +34/+29<br>Base AC 29<br><br>Shadow Daze DC 31<br>Death Attack DC 34<br><br>Death Attack +11d6<br>Sneak Attack +4d6<br><br>Syrath<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/10/07 14:02</span></i></p>

Somebody posted it on the HotU General Forms a month ago when someone asked for a good Rogue type character. I don't know where that topic is.

Tyr where is this build from the original post an unfinished build? If it is similar to another build, then please post the link. With only so many classes and some many combos, it is likely about 50% of the builds here represent another unintentionally. <br><br>This build is valid.<br>This build is playable.<br>TyrPaladin is a complete moron who can only insult people, and when they get pissed about it, she calls it sarcasm.<br>TyrPaladin should develp her intellect so that she can better attempt to sound like she has one, instead of faking it badly.<br><br>Should I post any more facts in this thread so far?<br><br>/ed. Nice build btw Syrath. I can't recall seeing an assassin buld with SC5 myself, and it looks like a lot of fun.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Emrill on 08/08/04 11:58</span></i></p>

It must be nice to live in your own little world. Not once did Syrath post an illegal build, and you still haven't posted a link to anything slightly similar, even though there is a build index with class/level splits stickied at the top of this forum. I think you're ranting because Syrath has been constantly proven right in his comments about your builds, while you can't really find anything about his couple working builds posted here, so you make stuff up.

That has to be the most retarded arguement I've ever seen. He posted an unfinsihed version of a build as a baseline for another player on another board, and liked the idea. Finished it, and posted the finished build here, yet he posted the unfinished build somewhere else (even though it was just a quick concept to help a player). Like I said, you are definately in your own little world. <br><br>Let me use your favorite little synbol a few times so you can better understand. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif"> <br>There all those rolling eyes should help you understand.

Tyrpaladin, <br><br>Please be so good as to look back at my posts in the excellent build thread. <br><br>I started the conversation off with asking why when you first post a build does it have so many errors. You evaded this question for sometime before you actually admitted that they are ideas. This is actually valid until someone points out that both this thread and the excellent build thread are for valid and complete builds. <br><br>You have openly admitted that they were not thereby also admitting that you had broke the rules of this build forum and the excellent build thread. <br><br>This was my argument. I have never posted an invalid build in either of these places. So how am I a hypocrit , please include links this time not quotes (since you frequently misquote anyway).<br><br>Syrath

I did not post it in <br><br>a/ Excellent build forum - For finished builds<br>b/ Epic Character build forum(ie here) - <br><br>I did not post it and say it was a finished build(or lead anyone to believe it was) nor did I post it anywhere that requires a finished build.<br><br>Which btw is what you used to do. <br><br>Syrath

I can't believe what I'm reading, TyrPaladin is an argument she can't win again!!!<br><br>why do you need to justify yourself TyrPaladin when noone has treated you unfairly, at least not from what I've read. syrath1001 doesn't really post all that many builds, and every build of his that is posted as finished actually works... the same can of course not be said about yours, I've made mistakes myself (first build didn't work at all at first) but you can't really *** about being wrong. and since I make my builds using pen and paper and actually trusted the manual I try to stand very humbly corrected when someone is nice enough to actually care about telling me what's wrong with my builds.<br><br>happy gaming <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
