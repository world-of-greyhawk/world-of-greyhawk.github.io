I am not sure what to say!  Looks good.<br><br>The thing I found with Intuitive attack is, it doesnt (or didnt) work like zen archry or wpn finesse.  As I understood, bioware didnt leave an opening for bab changes like that outside of what they put in.  This means your AB is +20 (wisdom AND all the junk, so just wisdom).  The character sheet MAY read different, but from my experience, this is the way it worked.  <br><br>Now, you DIDNT put which version of PRC you used, and i dont know if a fix for this was ever accomplished.  It is also my understanding that as soon as you change alignement, you loose the align only feats!  If you have any info on this, it would be great.  All i know is we were always EXTREMELY disappointed by these feats simply cuz balance is impossible!<br><br>Oh, and its way too bad that no PW allows full prc!  Lich would be crazy!

(ON SOAPBOX) I try to ignore the Bioware (et. al.) nerfs - the uneven-ness / idiocy is too depressing. I figured the +20 cap was only PW / server bc it was too stupid to apply to single player OC / Xpansions. Explains why everyone goes for Shifter builds that use high Str forms. Don't know if PRC has a "logic" button to override B-ware junk. (OFF SOAPBOX)<br><br>"Looks good." Pun intended for a Max Cha build / race?<br><br>I try to create new &amp; interesting combos, then post the .bic so no one has to waste time building a duplicate. <br><br>This one was the Nymph AC / Monk AC / Lich ability mod synergy. Hadn't seen the combo before and hadn't seen a higher PRC AC. The uber saves were just a bonus.<br><br>Pedigree was 3.3G Release candidate 3 [my full 3.3G release Char tester module got corrupted]. Used PRC Leto to max hp and change skills - Lich Int mods don't add skill points on the fly.<br><br>Intui Attack doesn't appear to be path dependent. If you disarm &amp; re-arm the Kama's, the bonus will show for G align. Switched alignment from G to E, rested, disarmed, re-armed and the bonus was gone. Switched back to G, repeated and the bonus came back. PRC is awesome software, but align tracking is probably not worth the effort.<br><br>Lich on PW?! Heh Heh. I just dream this stuff up &amp; push the limit(s), not advocating unleashing Sultans of Smack (Lich build w/epic spells) on mortal (non-Lich) builds.

the +20 cap has always been apart of the game.  Not sure why you would think its pw specific.  There have been builds posted with WAY more ab showing than they get.  The sheet ALWAYS lies!  <br><br>Since it wasnt part of my pw, i never seriously looked at lich.  The only class i did fuss over was Mystic Theuge... i still lie awake at night contemplating lv 9 arcane AND divine WITH dev crit and epic dodge.. anuis would add T Rage!  LOL  Impossible?  most definitely!  I would settle for lv 9 a &amp; d with ONLY dev crit!  Having 36 caster lvls or so in each would be alot of fun!  Esp since you dont need feats for epic spells, though, epic spells are realy lv 10 spells, and become dispellable!  (dont even get me started on that pos!).<br><br>All in all, glad to see that someone is keepin PRC alive <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

If you have an arbitrary AB bonus cap, an intelligent system (aka not B-ware) would have it mathematically connected to the Max AC. If the cap prevents a max buffed melee char from hitting the Max AC possible, you've got the wrong effing cap! However, getting the correct cap, or even if there should be one, requires effort to stack out - something B-ware was unwilling or unable to do.<br><br>An AB cap only makes sense where Max AC is restricted (AC cap?); i.e. PW - where AC &amp; ability bonus items can be controlled.<br><br>When I am on console, I can toolset +20 for multiple AC types (Dodge, Armor, Defl) and +12 to all abilities, so the Max AC is 95% unhittable with a cap. With no AC cap, there should be no AB cap - i.e. OC &amp; Expansions.<br><br>In short, an AB cap ONLY makes sense where there is an AC cap - a PW with item restrictions. <br><br>Hardwiring into the base engine itself is indefensible.

The +20 magical enhancement cap exists just like the +12 ability cap and the +20 save cap.  And the +20 dodge AC cap.  And the +50 skill cap.  The highest possible AA build is about 60 mundane AB, or 86 max.  A pure weapon master will hit around 80.  That's with +12 str/dex and a +20 weapon.<br><br>The cap mainly exists to put a power limit on clerics as they can hit that +20 cap with just their spells.<br><br>The fact that the AB/AC system is horrible, especially since AC can scale up 5 times as fast as AB, is why properly balanced items is needed.  Just because you *can* make an item in the toolset means nothing.<br><br>I can make myself immune to all damage besides Divine Might/Shield/Favor and give myself enough regen to mostly negate that with 2 level 40 legal items.  Don't judge a game by what broken items can be made in the toolset <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Magical Master on 11/21/09 17:24</span></i></p>
