(We'll forget about the factors that raise AB, as they'll be the same for both bulds in the comparison). He casts Divine Power and gets an attack routine of +20/+15/+10/+5.<br><br>Now, imagine a build such as CLC 15/Bard 1/AA 4. His attack schedule is +15/+10/+5. After casting Divine Power, he gets an extra attack, resulting in this attack schedule: +20/+15/+10/+20.<br><br>There's a definite advantage to having that lower BAB, but (as I mentioned) it relies on a spell, which you may not be comfortable doing.<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Also, note that there are a few quirks with archers that are not mentioned in the manual:<br><br>*There is a -2 attack roll penalty on moving targets<br>*Point Blank Shot bonus does not affect moving targets<br>*Epic Prowess will not show up in your character sheet with a ranged weapon but has been confirmed as working<br><br>Link to the thread on Epic Prowess:<br><a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=410071&amp;forum=42&amp;sp=0" target="_blank">Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 09/15/05 12:54</span></i></p>

It's from Enchant Arrow X.<br><br>I have a Wisdom-based archer somewhere too.

interesting spin on the cleric archer.  <br><br>You might want some of these feats, although the build is trying to do alot, so feats are scarce.<br><br>Grab called shot if you get a chance (maybe with feats saved from removing combat casting line).  This feat is very good for archers.  Called-shot leg will slow enemies down so you can pelt them with arrows longer.<br><br>Silent spell is also vital for combat medic types, since it allows you to cast mass heal with your lvl 9 spell slots.<br><br>edit: duh, rapid shot is a combat mode feat... ignore comments about improved combat casting...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By jjjhhhlll on 09/12/05 20:02</span></i></p>

Avado, that is base damage from Enchant Arrow X.  Grab a modest +5 mighty bow and it goes to 15(with str buff).  It really is quite decent damage for a bow and you still have the wide range of ammo to chose from and the added damage there.  I have this character at level 22 now in the PW I play on and she is really fun and just plain awesome.<br><br>Only thing to remember is, make sure you stock up on arrows because you go through them really, really fast! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>The idea of using silent spell is great as well.  You need combat casting on this character - I still get interrupted when trying to heal the tank so every bit helps.  I would swap toughness out for it as HPs are not this characters top priority.  I must say though, enemies seem to run after me quite a bit even when I'm way back plucking away.  Must be something in the AI code about cleric/archers...

Thanks for the info on archers!   The only archer I ever built was a cleric 21/wiz/aa1 build (was gonna be 23/1/rest..  but I was having so much fun with the number of spell slots (yes you can get tons of spells hence the combat casting suggested) then the pw i was on had a restructuring and I lost the character so I havent worked on one since.   <br><br>Peace

Talamier, nice job. This looks like an excellent party support character. I think you nailed exactly what you were looking for in the build.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Thanks Cin, she turned out rather well.  I'd like to make a few more comments on this build with a suggestion or two:<br><br>*Take cleric as the first level and then Wizard.  All this does is make handling spells easier since when you open up your spell book, your cleric spells will come up as default.  It can get annoying having the wiz book open up first all the time.<br><br>*Take a school as wizard, such as Illusionist, for a free spell slot.  You won't use much save mage armor and true strike but you will get them 3x a day instead of two.<br><br>*You actually end up with 47 extra skill points so use them on whatever you like.<br><br>I did some testing on replacing Toughness with silent spell.  At level 40 with no gear, I was able to mass these spells in my level 5 to 9 slots:<br><br>10x Mass heal<br>2x Storm of Vengence<br>3xRessurection<br>13xHeal<br>4xExtended Haste<br>1xTruesight<br><br>Now THAT is a lot of healing!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif">
