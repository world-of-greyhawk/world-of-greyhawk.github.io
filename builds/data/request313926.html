Hey there. Been looking for a nice smiting/paladin build designed for PvP in a +5 environment. Fairly easy to get your stats maxed, usually over 2 maxed out without potions. Need at least 5 levels in each class, no other restrictions. <br><br>Been looking at <br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "242764", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>and<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "212002", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>I'm pretty much a newb when it comes to Paladins, so help me out. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

Holy crabs!! Endy you did work on your own!  *applause!!<br><br>They are both good, i tend to like Cinn's better.  Smiters generally suck for pvp.  They have the easiest defence known to man (be Neutral!)... ohh.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   I remember a guy braggin bout his damage and challenged my cleric to battle.  He tried hundreds of times, and died even more often, before i told him i was True Neutral.  <br><br>If you can live with that, id try to tweak a build to get to Great Smite 10.  You also need strength and some charisma (maybe 18-20ish, if that).  One of the problems i kept having with smiters back in 2006 was getting the AB to acceptable lvls.  If you can live without Gr Smite, which is possible, Grizz did a pal/wm or something like that, that had crazy ab with smite damage (iirc)...  come to think of it, i may be wrong about that.  It may have been I high Divine might damage build with crazy AB..  yeah, im no help!  LOL

Haha, well than, thanks for the tip.<br><br>Oh, I recently tested something interesting with Divine Power, not sure if you know, so might as well tell you anyway <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Was working with a 29 Cleric/5 Fighter/6 Monk build, when I decided that 26 Cleric/9 Monk/5 SD would be much more awesome. Anyway, what I tested and learned:<br>Level 20 Cleric I made with Divine Power and Haste I made had an AB of 24/+19/+14/+24/+19. Same build as level 16 Cleric/4 Fighter (For the extra attack)with Divine Power and Haste had an AB of  +24/+19/+14/+9/+24. Thus...Better AB without the fighter pre-epic. Thought it was very interesting.

Dude, you're kidding right? I mean, no offense, but you've been in the guild long enough, so how the [insert a lot of flaming adjectives that can't be said in Bioware Forums] didn't you not know that by two or four years from now?<br><br>Anyway, unless you plan on sleeping a lot, sometimes it's not such a big deal. Taking Cleric only for Divine Power is wrong, you take Cleric, then be a Cleric, and use the full buffer pack.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/16/09 07:21</span></i></p>
