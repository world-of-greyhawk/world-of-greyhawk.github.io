Both questions assume a fairly standard weapon-master build, human, scimitar.<br><br>Question 1: In a high-magic world, where one is usuing a weapon that does, say, 2d6 sonic, 2d6 lightning, 2d6 acid, 2d6 magic, 2d6 extra slashing, 2d6 cold, 2d6 fire, and 2d6 massive crits, is it a waste of two feats to get Weapon Specialization and Epic Weapon Specialization?  Any thoughts?<br><br>Question 2: Because of the way this PW is put together, I'll  able to get Improved Whirlwind Attack at the cost of one Epic Damage Reduction (which, because of those rules, I didn't have to give up anything significant for).  In a PW where Dev Crit is disabled, is there any value in Improved Whirlwind?  Assume I have or could get Great Cleave by giving up WS.  (You see how these tie together).<br><br>Thanks in advance.

Any thoughts? </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Depends. Are there items that grant DR 15/sonic, lightning, acid, etc.? Because that will largely neutralize most of the bonus damage from your weapon. If not, then EWS is a waste - 6 more points won't matter. If so, then it's not a waste - the extra 6 base damage points may be the only ones that get through, the rest will get eaten up by the various DR types. <br><br>For example, even a simple Ring of Elemental Resistance will give DR 15 vs. fire, cold, lightning, and acid. That takes care of 4 of your 2d6 bonuses right there. If there are unusual items that also resist sonic and magic (the only 2 on your list that are generally hard to find), then I would say EWS may be a good investment. If there are items with high DR vs. slashing, piercing, etc., then you may also want to carry a few different types of weapons (i.e. focus on scim, but carry a warhammer and a rapier just in case....).<br><br>TM
