I am not sure how they couldnt work together?  btw, Dodge ac DOES stack to +20.  It is the only ac that does.  <br><br>Now, taking COT in epic does nothing for improving AB.  You could take the super class "gerbal" in epic and get +10 to your bab from lv 20.  I know div might adds damage.  That is why i suggested it.  With a relatively weak character with no physical damage output, and no AB, IF you are going to mix it up, you want to make sure that ALL the few hits you make hit hard.  You have 28 cha base, so div might makes alot of sense.  Like i said though, these cant happen with COT version, so the build is really changed alot (sorc/pals are plentiful).<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 11/27/07 23:01 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I agree with avado, Storm of Vengeance rocks, it stuns great, it can deal heavy damage over time, and Evasion doesn't work against it, you should try it in your strategy as well, too bad it's conjura</div></blockquote>

EMA gives +5 to dodge (as well as +5 armor, deflection, and natural).  DS dodge is indeed dodge AC, but, as mentioned, it does stack, up to +20.  Unless you are getting some pretty huge bonus from something else (say, bard song, and haste), they can work very nicely together.  W/ EMA, MA, haste, and DS w/ a 30 CHA, you'll hit the cap.  If you have other items, or spells, that might start to limit the utility, but even if you're sitting at +15 or so w/out DS, +5 AC is nothing to sneeze at.

If you add let's say +30 to your AB the character sheet says you have them, but in feedback rolls you can notice it's not true.<br><br>Divine Wrath will add damage, but it's true, Divine Might would add more.<br><br>What really hits you hard is the low BAB because you take all pre-epic as Sorcerer. With only 10 pre-epic BAB you'll be making only 2 attacks per round, and I don't want to be mean, but that sucks for any character who attempts to fight in melee. With just one more CoT pre-epic you'll reach 3 APR, but truth be told, I wouldn't see the build as a spellsword without 16 BAB. The best route to improve that might be Paladin, since you can't take CoT early on a build with so much Sorcerer. A Paladin 12 / Sorcerer 8 pre-epic spread reaches the 16 BAB required to make 4 APR, which is impossible with a Sorc/CoT spread.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

That build craves ab, damage is less important (divine might). And Epic spell penetration is highly important with 25 lvls of Sorc. No way pally goes here. Hope no other changes come into my mind with that build.
