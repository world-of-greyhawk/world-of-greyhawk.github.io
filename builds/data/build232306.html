Hi' all! <br><br>I've messed around with a build lately which I've come to like. I didn't find it with the search engine, so I thought I'll post it here just for fun.

Ah, didn't know about the template. Thanks.<br><br>The reason for the wf kama is to require for COT which needs wf in a melee weapon.<br><br>I thought strenght would be nice due to the crazy amount of extended divne power spell's he can toss around. But yeah, imp invis would be nice.

Nice idea...<br> <br>I don't see the need for Power Attack, Monks get Cleave for free anyway. I'd be inclined to drop that.<br><br>Possibly Toughness instead because of your low HP<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 03/02/06 06:32</span></i></p>

Dropping Power Attack would mean dropping the Divine feats. It's a prerequisite. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>A nice build! I like it!

I'd consider  dropping BAB to 15 to fully exploit DP, if it doesn't cripple the build (moving CoT levels to epic, that is).<br><br>The build looks really good.
