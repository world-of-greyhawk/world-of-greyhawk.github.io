Good Build TyrPaladin but i might recommend throughing 1 lvl of Dwarven Defender at 39 for Defensive stand and Defensive awarness. You would only lose 2 in Strength Feats but also gain dodge and Toughness on your character<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By XyberKnight on 08/09/04 20:13</span></i></p>

I would lose my exotic feats and Epic Prowess. This is the only I consider Uncanny Dodge/Dwarven Awarness is useful when I'm playing a character who doesn't have spot/listen or a true seeing spell. You can still get sneak attack even with UD/DA, but you retain your dex when it happens. Most of the time when I pvp, I end up picking up a stealth character in my sights. One time, I let the dude walk to me and as he got 5 feet in front me, I popped his @$$.<br><br>Since this is a cleric, it gets true seeing as a spell so need dwarven awarness.<br>_________________<br>Which Stick are you?<br><a href="http://www.ihateyour.com/cgi-bin/bbs/YaBB.cgi?action=games;game=Stuntexperience" target="_blank">Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrPaladin on 08/09/04 21:06</span></i></p>
