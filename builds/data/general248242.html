Wondering what the best Melee build is. I know there are a lot of circumstances that revolve around the server in question, or the enviroment or whatever, but all around, what is the best Melee'r? I'm guessing RDD is involved in it, because of the free Strength and AC and all that. Weapon Master part of it too? That would leave Bard I guess? <br><br>Or are none of those classes even important?<br><br>I'm looking for offence though, not defence so much. DD's are good and all, but too defencive I think. DR is great, I know... but personal preference is the ability to smash rather than to be smashed I suppose.<br><br>Assuming the equipment is set for a low-magic enviroment? Like, +5 or lower, which Melee would prosper? Lets also say that Dev Crit is allowed, as is HiPS, Dragonshape, and all the good stuff. What would be ideal? Dev Crit is powerful, but I don't understand how it works because I've never used it. I don't even know the prerequisits! <br><br>Dragonbuilds are nice, but they normally got too many spells for me to call a Melee though. <br><br>Would a Bard/RDD/SD with Dev Crit be really good? A strength based, Dev Crit'er with HiPS?<br><br>In your opinion, what is the best Melee?

My bad. I got so caught up in my racism that I didn't realize I didn't answer constructively at all.<br><br>I think its an RDD build with the highest Melee AB in the game, right?

Well, OP said something about not liking spell reliance. Well, correct me if I am wrong on that... but when he said that Dragonshapers normally rely on a few spells, and he said that was negetive, I got the impression that Spell-Heavy builds were not something he liked. But again, correct me if I am wrong OP.<br><br>Clerics, I think, are the most spell-reliant Melee's in the whole damn game, right? I normally hate Clerics, to be honest. Imploders are cool, but as Melee's they need too much time to prepair and then they might be Morded and all that jazz.<br><br>If it isn't RDD though, what build is the highest AB Melee? Bard/RDD/WM I assumed, Strength and WM bonus stuff, GMW and Bard Buffs... sounds good but I didn't really look into it. So what is it Fin?<br><br>But.. gah! Side-Tracking I think. If the OP don't like them stupid buff-heavy weaklings, whats next?<br><br>I would have to say that Bards are great. GMW, Keen, Bulls Strength, War Cry, Bardsong, Haste, Invisibility. Thats all you need, and you are prepaired and ready to go, so long as you multi-class into something with some punch.<br><br>I think the Bard/RDD/SD sounds interesting, but I never played anywhere with Dev Crit still allowed, so I never really got experience in testing it.<br><br>Someone help me out here.

Sorry guys I wasnt clear.<br><br>Okembour is kinda right, but not completely. I dont really like Clerics much because they have so many buffs and I am just bad at managing it all. I never really thought about the disadvantage of preperation or being dispelled but now that I think of it it kind of seems a hastle as well.<br><br>My preference was always to have less spells but for different reasons lol. So, when I said Melee'r, I kinda meant it in a way where there are less spell needs.<br><br>But ya, I guess Okmbour is right about Bards right? A few buffs and they are done? Not hard to manage the spells and they can take RDD levels or PM levels and all that. But Im kind of losing my train of thought here.<br><br>So with the new info, what would make the best Melee'r relying on as few buffs as possible? Offensively.<br><br>I assume it has Dev Crit? That just seems so powerful. HiPS I think is the best defence, and RDD gets the Strength up fast... but I dont know how to make it all mesh, or if that is even the best choice.

Well, I don't know Stats and numerical features of builds, but I really did think it was Bard/RDD/Weapon Master. <br><br>As for the Cleric thing, it is actually decent now that I think of it. I prefer Bard, as it gets Song and Keen, as well as a few other things and it gives access to RDD and Pale Master and with Curse Song and Taunt, can cripple a foe damn quick. But Clerics can get GMW as well, and Darkfire is decently useful but it is easily shot down when against any foe with resistance to fire which is quite common through spells, feats, items, and class features. Clerics though, can get some spells to back them up. But again, I suppose that isn't what you wanted because that is leaving the domain of Melee.<br><br>RDD is a natural choice because of the Strength, which, as I understand it, is a prerequisit for that Devestating Critical you want, and it is a good Damage and Attack boost. The wings are cool, and the immunities are nice. My favourite thing about RDD though, is that is coexists so well with Bard, another great class due to reasons discussed above.<br><br>There are also other things to keep in mind too, though. Blackgaurd and Paladin make good choices for Melee. If you know you will be fighting Evil in PvP, I don't think anything... ANYTHING... beats a Paladin/CoT/Weapon Master, but they are generally poor for most PW or RP servers as you will often be fighting something other than Evil, or you will end up expending your Smites fast. Blackgaurd though, gives you Sneak Attack, Divine Might, Divine Shield, Charisma to your Saves, a pathetic Summon, and a Smite Good which can be useful once in a while. With good Charisma, the BG becomes powerful in Melee, because it also gets a full BAB with some Spell-Like abilities.<br><br>Weapon Master, with a lot of levels, can earn you a huge AB without any buffs or effects. But their saves normally aren't overly good, and their AC's and HP's are average at best. I dont perticularily like heavy WM, but seven levels are your friend unless there are Critical Immunity items or some other thing that makes them defective.<br><br>Fighter gets feats. Thats it. Don't go heavy fighter. You shouldn't really have need for more than 10 levels of Fighter, I don't think.<br><br>Rangers are not something I understand. They don't seem very powerful, and sometimes almost seem crippled.<br><br>So, as for what makes the best combination, I'm not sure. Rogue's use of UMD and Evasion, as well as Sneak Attacks are a good addition, and HiPS is a good defence unless True Sight hasn't been altered to only see magic disguise. But the best? I wish I knew the numbers.<br><br>So, who does know? What is the best Melee AB known? Whatever it is, I think it should be stickied somewhere (Maybe it is and I never looked, because this was never a thought of mine until now...) But I am still thinking Bard/RDD/Something is the best.

The biggest part of the time you spend buffing as a Cleric is immediately after rest, since most of your buffs are long lasting especially if extended and if going for high cleric levels, the latter giving you the benefit of higher SR (Cleric lvl +12) and higher resistance to Mords. The short term buffs you use just before entering battle are just a few (divine favor, divine power, prayer and a few others from domains like AoV or Haste if you have a need for them and/or access to them), besides you should start meleeing from greater sanctuary or at least II so that you'll have time to buff up.<br><br>Cleric 35/FTR 4/Rogue 1 or Cleric 37/FTR 2/Rogue 1 exploiting the club bug, or even Cleric 38/FTR 1/Rogue 1 exploiting the same bug.

Dev Crit is allowed you say? Thought about Bard/RDD/PM? You end up with a decent unbuffed AB (42) which is easily buffable (GMW, war cry, BS, bard song, curse song, taunt), great AC (41+ naked) again easily buffable (mage armor, magic circle against alignment, haste, bard song, curse song), crit immunity, paralysis/stun immunity, fire immunity and possibly Epic Warding and EMA if you go for Bard 14/PM 16. Bard 20/PM 10 gives you LI, a stronger bard song and more bardic spells. <br><br>It's a nice build to play.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

All Dwarven Defender/Red Dragon Disciple builds need a Bard or Sorcerer level in, everybody chooses Bard over Sorcerer for the skills, BAB and song, and there are 13 of them on the index if my memory serves right. Don't worry, you'll see my abonimation in less than a week, I just need to check everything is in order, eat my meal with lots of ale, and click on "Post". You can always find how to beat a build, there is no such thing as the perfect build, but one can try.<br><br>Aside from the dwarven dispute which seems not to be progressing on either side, the original post was made by Zoodleton, aka, the only guy who's missing to reply here, he should make the call for the build he likes, not any of us, suggestions have been made and all, so there's nothing else for me to do here.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Say no to racism.

Well, without elemental resistance a shifter dragon with lotsa druid/shifter lvls will have a strong breath weapon which can take care of the DwD, spamming it in Imp expertise mode.

You are all impossible. Dwarves suck.

Yes I says Dwarven Defender Dragon. <br><br>No the DRs do not stack but against +6 or better weapons your natural dragon DR is worthless. Keep present that another dragon build will ignore your dragon DR too.  You also keep the boni from defensive stance (the dodge bonus to AC is useless though).
