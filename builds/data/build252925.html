So, I am not sure what the last two levels of wizard really gain you.  A +2 to spell penetration checks?  Perhaps you would do better to use the two free levels as stat dumps for discipline / spot / whatever and maybe pick up evasion in the process (monk or rogue).

As you say Discipline isn't entirely necessary, but in playing him he does get put down a lot, but that doesn't stop them killing themselves on his shields. That happens faster when you're standing in the middle of an Empowered Acid Fog, Emp and Max EBTs, Emp Cloudkill, Web and Grease to boot. All you need to do is toss in a Maxed Negative Energy Burst and watch them pop. most are toast well before he hits half HP. <br><br>Playing this little fella now on a PW and can prepare spells for any occasion. You could do a cross-classed Discipline dump, just to help, but really you'd be better putting them into Search/ Disable Trap/ Open Lock to give you more versatility.<br><br>Not sure I like cheese too much with the single level of Monk/ Rogue/ Fighter/ whatever, but I can see the benefits of taking them.<br><br>Either way you could sub out one of the schools for Transmutation giving you a 41 DC when fully buffed for Flesh to Stone spells.

You could also polymorph into a zombie and not worry about sneak/dev crit peeps.<br><br>you'd still be using your magic shields and you could walk in and out of combat to provoke aoo swings.

I would really have to take 1 level of Ranger at level 40* for a skill dump into discipline, as well as any of hide, move silently, set traps or spot...plus if you had worked in Combat Casting you could get the improved combat casting feat for free!!!<br><br>You would lose 1 caster level but IMO the gain of discipline alone would outweigh the loss of 1 SR penetration &amp; a 5% loss of dispelling power with Mords**!!!<br><br>*or 39 if you wanted to take ESF: discipline

And let's say he goes into combat with a very mediocre Rogue with a modified 50AB.  And let's assume the Rogue is human with IKD.  Rogue swings an IKD, rolls a 10+50, -1 for size, -4 for IKD attempt, = 55, hit.  <br><br>Spanky, with his sparkling 43 Discipline, now has to resist the IKD vs the 55DC.  But wait, he gets -4 because he's small stature, and he gets a further -4 due to Rogue having IKD.  So effectively, the DC is now 63.<br><br>Spanky has to roll a natural 20 in that scenario just to resist.  If that Rogue had rolled an 11 instead of a 10, he couldn't beat it at all. Give Spanky some Str enhancements, and his odds are slightly better, but not by much.  Swap out mediocre rogue for high AB meleers, and the situation is even worse.  Therefore, unless he's going to take ESF: Disc, or Shapechange into Iron Golem form, I wouldn't even bother with Disc.  I suppose if you make the char at Lvl 40, then why not, right?  But if you play from the ground up, and you reach Level 39 without having a point of discipline, it will hardly matter by Level 40.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 09/16/06 13:37</span></i></p>

I would hate to immobilize a casters offensive by a polymorph, but that is a good idea.  Just seach for a polymorph with low AC, and Crit/Sneak immunity, so you don't get hit by those pesky Devastating Critical..<br><br>As a moment of thought, if your shield absorbs the whole critical do you have to make a fortitude save?

Thanks for the feedback everyone. <br><br>I have given the Discipline, Tumble, Evasion points some consideration, but to be honest, with the spell casting this little chap has it has yet to be a major issue. Maybe I am not testing him hard enough.<br><br>Still we'll see, things may change yet.
