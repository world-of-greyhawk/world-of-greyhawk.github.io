I have been wanting to make a Smite based character...and though I am mostly good natured I want a nice evil character to smite those nasty do goog goodies! So I was thinking along the lines of Blackguard (naturally) but then to boost AB I thought a bit of RDD certainly wouldn't go amiss...<br><br>Searching with the search engine left me still hungry, the most appetising being - <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "211825", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Charismatic Dwarf v2</a> ...widening the search to encompass all blackguard builds yeilded too many to contemplate so I made my own...though maybe someone could point me in the right direction!!!<br><br>Basic advantages over the Charismatic Dwarf are the smite damages <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  though lack of knockdown is a bummer!<br><br><b>Playable 1-40 PvE</b> - though really designed PvP vs. Good<br><br><b>The Draconic Smiter</b><br>Bard 8 Red Dragon Disciple 10 Blackguard 22<br><br>Race : Human (I do love Dwarves, however the -2 Charisma was irreconcilable for a Charisma based build!!!)<br><br>Alignment : CE (NE is also acceptable, but I generally see CE as ultimately evil!)<br><br>Starting Statistics (final stats)<br><br>Str : 16 (30)	<br>Dex : 8	(8)<br>Con : 10 (12)	<br>Wis : 8	(8)<br>Int : 10 (12)	<br>Cha : 18 (26)	<br><br>Levelling Guide:<br><br>1 Bard (1) : power attack, cleave	<br>2 Bard (2) :	<br>3 Bard (3) : weapon proficiency exotic	<br>4 Bard (4) : CHA+1, (CHA=19)	<br>5 Bard (5) :	<br>6 Bard (6) : weapon focus	<br>7 Bard (7) :	<br>8 Red Dragon Disciple (1) : CHA+1, (CHA=20)	<br>9 Red Dragon Disciple (2) : blind fight*, (STR=18)	<br>10 Blackguard (1) :	<br>11 Blackguard (2) : <br>12 Blackguard (3) : CHA+1, divine shield, (CHA=21)	<br>13 Red Dragon Disciple(3) :	<br>14 Red Dragon Disciple(4) : (STR=20)	<br>15 Blackguard (4) : extra smiting	<br>16 Blackguard (5) : CHA+1, (CHA=22)	<br>17 Blackguard (6) :	<br>18 Blackguard (7) : improved critical	<br>19 Blackguard (8) :	<br>20 Blackguard (9) : CHA+1, (CHA=23)	<br>21 Red Dragon Disciple (5) : epic weapon focus	<br>22 Red Dragon Disciple (6) :<br>23 Red Dragon Disciple (7) : (CON=12)	<br>24 Red Dragon Disciple (8) : CHA+1, epic prowess, (CHA=24)	<br>25 Red Dragon Disciple (9) : (INT=12)	<br>26 Red Dragon Disciple (10) : (STR=24), (CHA=26)	<br>27 Blackguard (10) : epic skill focus: discipline	<br>28 Blackguard (11) : STR+1, (STR=25)	<br>29 Blackguard (12) :	<br>30 Blackguard (13) : great strength I, great smite I, (STR=26)	<br>31 Blackguard (14) :	<br>32 Blackguard (15) : STR+1, (STR=27)	<br>33 Blackguard (16) : great strength II, great smite II, (STR=28)	<br>34 Blackguard (17) :	<br>35 Blackguard (18) :	<br>36 Blackguard (19) : STR+1, great smite III, great smite IV, (STR=29)	<br>37 Blackguard (20) :<br>38 Blackguard (21) :<br>39 Blackguard (22) : great smite V, great smite VI	<br>40 Bard (8) : STR+1, (STR=30)<br><br>Skills:<br><br>Discipline 43(63)<br>Heal 17(16)<br>Hide 5(4)<br>Listen 43(42)<br>Lore 8(17)<br>Perform 7(15)<br>Tumble 43(42)	<br><br>Saving Throws:<br><br>Fortitude : 31<br>Reflex : 29<br>Will : 26<br><br>Attacks:<br><br>BAB 27 + 4 wf/ewf/ep +10 str = 41/36/31/26<br><br>with BG &amp; bard bull's strength stacking can get +10 str, +4 dex &amp; +4 cha, GMW would give +2 to weapon as well, +2 attack/damage from bardsong<br><br>---&gt; ab 50/45/40/35<br><br>for smiting: +10 ab from Charisma (assuming +4 cha from eagles spendour),+15 str (10 base abiltity + 5 2x lucky roll bullstrength) +14 damage (gmw/bardsong &amp; cha bonus) + 154 damage (22 blackguard levels x 7 (great smiting VI)<br><br>---&gt;(weapon damage) + 183 ...not too bad!!!<br><br>I chose the exotic weapon proficiency as I see it as a waste when you take martial, only to get it a few levels later.

Just a few thoughts:<br><br>Cap Tumble at 40 ranks, there is no benefit going higher than that.<br><br>Is Weapon Proficiency Exotic really worth it? There are a number of other feats that are possibly more necessary to make this guy more playable:<br><br>Extend Spell, Lingering Song, Curse Song, Divine Might and Toughness to name a few.<br><br>I would opt to take Weapon Focus once the first BG level has been selected. Considering you can cast 3rd level Bard spells, Extend Spell may be of serious use to you.<br><br>Poor HP for a meleer only 392.<br><br>I would consider dropping starting CHA to 16 and putting 4 points into CON and 2 into INT or DEX even. 6 stat points gone for +1 CHA modifier? A bit excessive.<br><br>Your damage calculations appear to be neglecting the 7d6 sneak attack from BG.<br><br>Either way on an evil non-crit immune enemy, they need to live in fear of you!

It's got slightly better AB than the Dwarf, but no taunt. A higher Smite damage as you say, but less chance of connecting. One round of standing flatfooted when you taunt is well worth it when your smites and KD's get a +6 chance to hit for a few rounds afterwards. Smite is a thrice pr day ability. Make it count. Have the Divine damage up while your enemy is taunted as well. Otherwise nicely done. <br><br>It's a less iconic, more munchkin type build than the Dwarf. Good to see people who like BG's.<br><br>*EDIT* Just noticed (even though you mention it) that you don't have Divine might. In a CHA 26 build, get it.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 01/06/06 06:53</span></i></p>
