<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM</b><br><br>I read a thread on a Monk / Wiz / PM on here recently, (in fact, this one: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "162846", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>) and it inspired me to do my own. This build isn't tested so it may not work, but I can't see any glaring errors myself after proofreading it a few times. I originally thought Dex-based would be the way to go, but if you consider that the 16 PM levels give +8 to AC, there's no prospect of ever getting Epic Dodge, and you can just cast Improved Invisibility or Empty Body rather than waste feats on Self Concealment, I thought Strength-based would make more sense.<br><br>I decided to keep the dual wielded kamas I had planned for a Dex-based version though. The Wizard and PM levels let you get Flame Weapon, Greater Magic Weapon and Keen Edge, none of which can be cast on fists. Plus there would be loads of spare pre-epic feats if I didn't have to fit in the 3 dual wield feats. Kamas also have a better critical threat range (I think...?) so it makes more sense to go for them, as the build does end up getting Dev Crit.<br><br>Human, Lawful Neutral<br>Str 16<br>Dex 15<br>Con 12<br>Int 14<br>Wis 10<br>Cha 8<br><br>1 - Monk 1 - Ambidexterity, Two Weapon Fighting<br>3 - Monk 3 - Weapon Focus Kama<br>4 - Monk 4 - Str +1 (17)<br>6 - Monk 6 - Power Attack<br>8 - Monk 8 - Str +1 (18)<br>9 - Monk 9 - Great Cleave<br>12 - Monk 12 - Str +1 (19), Improved Crit Kama<br>15 - Monk 15 - Improved Two Weapon Fighting<br>16 - Monk 16 - Str +1 (20)<br>18 - Wizard 2 / Monk 16 - Extend Spell<br>20 - Monk 18 / Wizard 2 - Str +1 (21)<br>21 - Wizard 3 / Monk 18 - Great Strength 1 (22)<br>24 - Pale Master 3 / Wizard 3 / Monk 18 - Str +1, Great Strength 2 (24)<br>27 - PM 6 / Wizard 3 / Monk 18 - Overwhelming Critical Kama<br>28 - PM 7 / Wizard 3 / Monk 18 - Str +1 (25)<br>30 - PM 9 / Wizard 3 / Monk 18 - Devastating Critical Kama<br>32 - PM 11 / Wizard 3 / Monk 18 - Int +1 (15)<br>33 - PM 12 / Wizard 3 / Monk 18 - Epic Weapon Focus Kama<br>36 - PM 15 / Wizard 3 / Monk 18 - Int +1 (16), Epic Warding<br>37 - PM 16 / Wizard 3 / Monk 18 - Hellball*<br>39 - Wizard 5 / PM 16 / Monk 18 - Epic Mage Armour, Great Intelligence 1** (17)<br>40 - Monk 19 / Wizard 5 / PM 16 - Str +1 (26)<br><br>Final stats<br>Str 26<br>Dex 15<br>Con 12<br>Int 17<br>Wis 10<br>Cha 8<br><br>His AB will never be great, what with only 26 Strength and no warrior-class levels. But to compensate he gets True Strike, Bull's Strength and Greater Magic Weapon to help him out a bit. It's not going to make him the greatest melee build in the world, but he doesn't need to be, he has a few other tricks up his sleeve.<br><br>His Wizard and PM levels give him the spells per day of a level 13 wizard, ie. up to 7th level of spellcasting. This includes such universally useful spells like Bigby's Forceful Hand, Mestil's Acid Sheath, Elemental Shield, and the aforementioned weapon buffs, all of which can be extended. I would recommend specialising as an Illusionist for the extra spell per day. <br>The real power of his spellcasting is in his three epic spells, though. Hellball is a good general damage spell with the added bonus of knocking everyone down for a round, but Epic Warding and Epic Mage Armour are the real killers apps here. They shouldn't be used together because what does it matter how often you're getting hit, when you can absorb 50 points of damage from any attack? A good way to use them is to have the Warding up while the damage shield spells like Elemental Shield are up. Then once they and the Warding run out, cast Epic Mage Armour, if need be.<br><br>I'm glad I finally managed to make a Monk / Wiz / PM I could see myself playing one day. That is, unless I've made an error somewhere and the build is unplayable. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 07/07/05 23:51</span></i></p>

A wizard can't take epic spells with less than 21 wiz levels; PM levels seem to require 15 but it looks like you're taking epic mage armor as a wiz feat with only 5 levels?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 12/31/04 12:44</span></i></p>

A very wonderful idea!<br><br>I am wondering though, what would happen if you took 2 more monk levels?  21monk/3wiz/16pm?  If you took 20 monk lvls before epic you'd gett the cool monk eyes!  and you'd get the monk attacks per round!  Im not sure how this would affect the spellcasting of the character, but im guessin the duration of the buffs wouldnt be that much different, even with extend.<br><br>Besides that, Im thinkin that i may try this one out myself!<br><br>Peace

The 5 Wizard levels gets you another Wizard bonus feat that lets you get Great Intelligence, and 7th level Wizard spells, including Bigby's. That's all it's used for really, as you sya, the buffs don't last long enough to be much use.
