IKD doesn't give you better AB. Both KD and IKD are at a -4 penalty to hit. What IKD does is treat your character as if he's a size category larger (and allows him to KD creatures up to two size categories larger than him, not just one sixe larger). This means your opponent's Discipline check will be at a -4 penalty if your opponent's medium sized, -8 penalty if your opponent's small sized, and no penalty if your opponent's large sized.<br><br>If you've the feat to spare, IKD is worth the investment.

Cinnabar Din,bud its hard to explain you would almost have to see the pvp world and try out your character,like theres one guy whos 16 pal and 24 Cot with smite he does like 300+ damage with a schim.but like as far as dex it really does help,but i could possible make it a str with schim but not sure. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">

I beleive if the sneakign opponent is invisible or in stealth mode adn you DON'T see them they they will catch you flatfooted. So if you want to go with a build like that you need high listen or spot and or True Seeing.<br><br>First of all that's Mason's Build on the BoW BCBC VIII thread, that won runner up, also exactly the same wording, so you might want to point that out.<br><br>Levelign order is retty self explanatory:<br><br>1-6 fighter<br>7-16 WM<br>17-20 fighter<br><br>then oin epic lvls take all WM and you can put the HS lvls whereever you want as logn as you eitehr end on one, or have one as the penultimate lvl to max Spot or listen. and get tumble to 40 if you hadn't already<br><br>If you are playign on BoW which it seems you are then you need: Blind Fight, Skill Focus Disc, Epic Skill Focus Disc. Also you can't take IKD because there aren't enough feats if yu take the compulurary ones. For WM take those eats in the first 6 lvls. Then for the 2 or so WM feats take Blidn Fight SF: Disc. For the Fighte feats take Allertness and Iron Will (For Harper Scout) and KD.<br><br>Epic feats are pretty self explanatory, reg feats are all great dex except one epic skill fucs Disc. HS are great dex both of them, and epic wm bonus are EWF, Armour Skin, Epic Prowess, Epic Toughness 1 and epic toughness 2.<br>_________________<br>~I am the wisest man on earth because I know one thing, and that is I know nothing.~<br>-Cairne

I think i have a screenshot showing it somewhere, but I do believe there is no way to post that here?<br>If you are flanked, only the guys who are able to sneak attack you, "catch" you flat-footed.<br><br>It was hard to test out, I had two friends of mine take two chars I had made, one sneak capable, one not.<br>They had the same AB, both could hit me only on a 20. But when I shifted target, so one could sneak attack, his sneak attacks hit me much more often, and AC's far lower than he should. I have no concrete number, but I'm pretty sure I somehow was counted for flat-footed when he sneak attacked me. When you are sneak immune(crit immune item in this case) his attacks ceased to connect as often even though he still flanked me.. Just test it and you'll see. Post your results when you do.<br><br>Those happenings with my monk was what made me test this.

InCruentus: apologies for hijacking your thread, but I'll post the results of my testing here for Grimnir. I does have relevance to your thread though, as it may make a difference on whether you choose a DEX build or not.<br><br>Grimnir: here's the results of my testing. I built a FTR 32/Bard 3/HS 5. Dwarf, DEX-based. The end stats were:<br><br>STR 14<br>DEX 34<br>CON 18<br>INT 12<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 6<br><br>I tested him in a leveller (Novie to Epic Character Builder) with no haks, just the basic content. I decked him out with Robes of the Darkmoon (Haste for +4 Dodge AC), Bracers of DEX +2 and Belt of Agility +10, Cloak of Protection +7 and Ammy of Natural Armor +7.<br><br>Here's what his AC breakdown was:<br><br>10 (base)<br>+8 (Tumble)<br>+2 (Armor Skin)<br>+18 (46 DEX)<br>+4 (Dodge - Haste robes)<br>+7 (Deflection, cloak)<br>+7 (Natural, Ammy)<br><br>total AC = 56<br><br>I took him into the arena vs 2 FTRs and a Rogue (all 40th level pure builds). I then enabled combat debugging, targetted one of the FTRs so the other FTR and Rogue were flanking, and watched the results.<br><br>The Rogue landed sneak after sneak (drained my STR pretty quick with Crippling Strike, btw). Anyhow, the combat debugging showed I did <b>not</b> lose my DEX or Dodge AC to the sneak-attacker. Here's what the log showed as far as my AC with regards to the Rogue's attacks (the parts in brackets are my comments):<br><br>AC 10 (base) +2 Natural (Armor Skin) + 8 Tumble (Tumble ranks of 40) + 18 (DEX modifier) + 4 Dodge (Haste) + 7 Effect AC Natural Bonus (Ammy) +7 Effect AC Deflection Bonus (Cloak).<br><br>That totals 56 AC.<br><br>The Rogue did receive a +2 flanking bonus to his attack as he should have.<br><br>The 2nd FTR also received a +2 flanking bonus and my AC was reported as exactly the same (56) vs him as well.<br><br>Conclusion: you <b>do not</b> lose your DEX-based or Dodge AC when flanked by either a regular FTR type or a sneak attacker.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

Hm, very strange. My monk got whipped bad until I releveled and took rogue to get uncanny. AC remained the same.<br><br>You sure the combat debugger works correctly? Have you checked the actual roll they need to hit you. I found my screenie. It shows the rogues hit me AC 34, while they should need to hit 40. (or something like that.) No one else could do that. My friend needed 20 to hit me face on, and 11 or so to hit me while he could connect sneak attacks, until I put on immune to crit item, then everything was right.<br><br>Very strange. I will need to do a retesting.<br>*shakes head*<br>Thanks for doing this test though.Perhaps time to rebuild my monk again.

In a pvp world, you need all the dex u can get considering the fact that most people tend to build tanks. I dunno much about self concealment, except for the fact that it provides dmg reduct, and it seams like a good feat to invest in. What pvp servers do u play at? if you play at summits I would to go head to head against you. Overall I think it is a great build in the sense that the high dex will keep you alive.<br><br>Ltr
