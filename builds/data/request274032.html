I am going to start playing on a PW soon that has character levels capped at 20 and is low magic. I want to go 9 Cleric (for haste and improved ivnisability spells) and 7 Black Guard for the summons and sneak damage. That leaves 4 levels to work with. I have made two builds which I will post here. One has 4 levels of Rogue, the other 4 levels of Fighter. <br><br>4 Rogue<br>Human<br>Any Evil<br>Levels 1-20<br><br>STR 16 (20)<br>DEX  8<br>CON 14<br>INT 12<br>WIS 14 (15)<br>CHA 12<br><br>AB 22/17/12/7<br>4d6 Sneak Attack<br>AC 13 (naked)<br>HP's 226<br><br>Saves<br><br>Fort 15<br>Refl  9<br>Will 12<br><br>Skills<br><br>Concentration 23 (25)<br>Hide 5 (4)<br>Spellcraft 19 (20)<br>Tumble 20 (19)<br>UMD 19 (20)<br>Discipline 22 (27)<br>Taunt 22 (23)<br>Points Left 4<br><br>1.

I'd lean towards the Rogue build, myself. You lose 1 AB and 2 base damage, but pick up 4 AC, 2d6 sneak damage and UMD. In general, I think that will be more decisive.<br><br>I might also drop Imp Crit for Extend Spell. With the sneak damage, most things that can be critted will be taking sneak damage anyway, so it won't be a big difference. <br><br>TM

TM,<br><br>Thanks for the quick response! <br>Though, the Rogue build does have Extend Spell already at level 3. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>What about adding more Cleric levels to have the ability to cast Harm? Maybe a Cleric 11/ Black Guard 7/ Rogue 2 split. Sorry for all the questions. I never play Clerics. Will harm even be effective with only 11 cleric levels?

Hmmm, well, the Fighter isn't granting that much, some feats are fine but you don't lack that much, and non-epic Weapon Specialization is nothing special at all, so I think Rogue is definitely better, though if you were asking for third class I'd go cheese Monk <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 05/17/07 04:34</span></i></p>

I'd go Cleric/Rogue. Forget BG, as you don't need it (unless it's a roleplay angle). You have summon spells with the CLC and enough buffs to make you an uber melee fighter without the third class. Something on the order of CLC 16/Rogue 4 or CLC 18/Rogue 2 if you want level 9 spells.<br>_________________<br>Captain's Log, Stardate 6051: had trouble sleeping last night... my hiatal hernia is acting up.
