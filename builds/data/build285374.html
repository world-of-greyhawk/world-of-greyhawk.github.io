M.I.D.A.S. Dwarven Construct (Monk20, Dwarven Defender 19, Assassin 1)<br>Dwarf, lawfull evil (for monk,assassin, dwarven defender, it's the only choice)<br>PvM playable lvl 1-40, PvP not tested<br>------<br><br>I' ve seen a number of Monk/DwD builds out there but most are strength based, I aimed at a more versatile character, mainly a tank that can survive huge punishment. My goal was to emulate as accurately as I could a construct using standard NWN classes.<br>As for the alignment, beeing a construct (automaton, see below for RP background), he would not care for morals, only results, so even if not inherently evil, he would act evil on certain occasions.<br>------<br><br>	"The Living Wall was there, as it has been for every day those past 6 years, standing proud, one next to the other perfectly aligned, while the continuous rain of arrows bounced off their shields. The Drow had long given up hope of appdroaching the dwarven line, but not before losing most of their army to the relentless pounding of hammers and axes. The Ilharess was content keeping the siege, in hopes that the Mithrillheart Clan would eventually starve and surrender, but after 6 years, she was starting to consider other options. For the Dwarven Warriors, this seemed like another long day, standing guard creating a wall of shields to fend off the arrows, some amogst them wishing for some action, a wish that was not far from coming true, but in a way the Dwarves could have never expected.<br>	The first sign that this day was different was a screeching scream coming from the Drow camp. Some of the Dwarven Defenders were filled with worry, others with expectation, but none budged from his position. And then the horror appeared, the most abominable of all creatures of the Underdark, Illithids and Beholders rushed forth by the thousants, the air filled with so much magic that one could harly breathe anymore, aiming no longer at the indistructible dwarven body, but the vulnerable mind. That day was the beginning of the end, as for the first time despair and fear broke what force and numbers could not, the Living Wall was retreating in terror.<br>	In the next few weeks, the Mithrillheart Clan lost all their Great Halls save for the House of the Council, as well as a large portion of their mineshafts. It was at this desperate time that Furin, one of the Elder Council, presented his masterpiece, an armor made of Mithrill. But this was not an ordinary armor, it could move by itself harnessing the power of fire and steam and It could respond to orders. Furin named his creation Mithrillheart Integrated Defence Automaton System (M.I.D.A.S.) and the next day he let it loose on the drows' mininons. <br>	M.I.D.A.S. performed more that exeptional against the spellcasting Illithids and Beholders, breaking their fragile bodies with easy and ignoring most, if not all the spells they cast on him. With his help, the Clan reclaimed their ancestral home within a month's time and left no Drow, Beholder or Illithind alive within their mountain and the Living Wall now numbered one more..."<br>------<br><br>Now on to the specifics:<br>Str   	14 <br>Con  	17 -&gt; 22<br>Dex	16 -&gt; 24<br>Int	14<br>Wis	08<br>Cha	06<br><br>Max HP 	674<br>Skill points	202<br>Saving throws<br>Fortitude	30<br>Reflex		28<br>Will		23<br>AB		33<br>AC		31<br>D.

Though this build is not Immune to death spells, negative levels, ability drains, the high fortitude save along with the decent SR help avoid such effects most of the time. As for critical hits immunity, I couldn't find a way to get 10 PM levels. I am however open to suggestion. The low Wisdom/high Intelligence depicts the fact that a machine can have high processing power, but it can never be wise.<br>Finally Assassin class serves to increase damage after a succesfull knockdown and use scrolls/magic items (M.I.D.A.S. has some files on anatomy to kill more efficiently), but it can be replaced with any other class you like, I just find it fitting to my roleplaying. The same applies for the last DwD level at 40, I simply chose it because it would give me the most HP.

Well, hard to say...<br><br>I never make DEX based Dwarven Defenders because you generally don't need high ACs with a Dwarven Defender if you're investing in Epic Damage Reduction, also, a DEX score of 24 isn't really so high, it's only +7 to AC, buffed to max of +13, against a heavy armor which gives 8 AC, the gain on AC isn't very big, and your damage is obviously low.<br><br>Why Assassin? it looks like only 1 level for skilldump at level 39, you would do better taking at least 2 levels and skilldump a bit earlier for playability, you won't lose anything by reducing your Dwarven Defender to 18.<br><br>Well, some SR is ought to be better than none, 30 isn't very high but I think it will be quite useful from time to time.<br><br>Empty Body is really nice, those melees are never going to kill you.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Taking 19 over 18 levels of DwD gains you one more use of defensive stance per day, and a few more hps. Thats about it.<br><br>Taking one more level in assassin gains you ghostly visage (wich is very nice, but then fairly useless with your DR and SR), and uncanny dodge (useless with the defensive awareness allready) and +1 on saves vs poisons, so pretty much nothing.<br><br>I would suggest barbarian with your decently high Con, giving you rage once a day. Or fighter for another bonus feat.<br><br>I'd suggest to drop improved parry and SF: parry for weapon focus in something and mabye iron will to make up for the pathetic AB and medicore will saves. Drop epic SF: parry for epic prowess and take fighter over assassin for the bonus feat, and take Epic weapon focus on lv 39.<br><br>Taking fighter also free 16 skill points for you (otherwise wasted on hide and MS). However, if you really want UMD (you only need it for monk gear mostly, and you allready have monk) its only to use some minor scrolls and stuff, things that are quite useless by the time you get UMD. I'd say take rogue (non evil, no smites and no skill requirements and more skillpoints. Still flaking damage).<br><br>I think thats about all I have to say. Ah, one more thing: damn you for beating me to a dex-heavy monk/dwd build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">
