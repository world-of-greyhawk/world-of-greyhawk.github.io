I'm looking for someone to make me a dragon build for my RP server.

What I mostly need is a build that can hold its own against heavy hitters and mages, especially paladins if I decide to go evil. And as far as I know, the server will hold no immunities on its items.<br><br>Thanks for the help

So you can use any classes and then get the bonuses above? The classic Fighter/Bard/RDD springs to mind. Lasting inspiration and the RDDs STR bonus in accordance with the +10 from Dragon and Bulls from bard spells will give you gooooood damage. Since EWS and such will be of little use, perhaps 4-6 fighter is enough? Bard 24/fighter6/RDD10. <br><br>I'm pretty sure Cleric26/Fighter4/CoT10 would also be sweeeet! or exchange fighter with tumble class, since you won't benefit from EWS. <br><br>Cleric26/Bard4/Rdd10 would be rocking. +10 STR from your dragon abilities, and then +8 from RDD let's you keep a high strength (30+) even if you make it WIS-based. Go for max WIS and implosion and other Cleric goodies and still keep a really good melee presence.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

D'oh! My mind must be numb....<br>Hm, Cleric26/fighter10Tumble-class4 then. Bard for lasting inspiration should be swell. Maybe a spellblade should do good with his dragon-bonuses. Since his extra strength offsets much of the strength he lacks because he invests in INT. Wizard 26/Fighter10/Whatever is worth a thought. Or just wizard26/Fighter14.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Prestige Classes. Sorry for getting you messed up. Also, True Sight is a common occurring thing in the server, so invisibility tactics should be thrown out the window now.

Well, I'll suppose normal dragon bugs such as no WF or Dev Crit is carried on as well... however, I'm not entirely sure how your dragon shape stuff is supposed to work, it won't override stats? because that changes a lot normal dragon building.<br><br>But what is wrong with that server, dragon shape at level 1? must be horribly flooded with dragons, I imagine a lot of wide open space...<br><br>20 levels of a spellcasting class! you can't get Bane of Enemies with that, too bad, well, what you want your build to do? I think Cleric/Fighter/Barbarian will net most damage, taking Wizard or Sorcerer instead will get you Epic Warding, which migth be better, or you could even go caster and kill dragons with spells. Maybe Sorcerer 32 / Fighter 4 / Paladin 4, or similar, take Divine Might and Divine Shield, you might get a strong caster and melee with high saves.

The prerequisites for the subrace are extremely limiting. I will be one of the few who will get it without unlocking it, as I helped make it. What I am looking for is a build that will hold its own in PvP against most, if not all, things thrown at it, without having to have precise timing to be effective.<br><br>Oh, and I forgot to mention, you must start as a human race to get the subrace.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By To Nowhere on 03/06/07 03:27</span></i></p>

Why Ftr 4?  WF and SW don't carry over to Dragon form.<br><br>I'd probably take Rogue over fighter in order to get Evasion.  Reflex save for 1/2 is nothing to scoff at.
