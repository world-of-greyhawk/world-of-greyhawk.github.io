Epic Character Builds – The Hex Blade<br>By Deborah “Tyr” <br>Hex Blade is a tactical fighting specialist, and knows the power of music. Combining his/her mastery of the longsword with innate bard song talent, he/she is an irresistible defender, and an unforgettable attacker; music affects all within ear shot, be they friend or foe. Created by NWN community member, and long-time D&amp;D melee “purist,” this character has been built to strike fear and pandemonium into swarming gangs, monsters, and entire battle fields, in order to send them packing. First-and-foremost, Hex Blade is a blade master, having the artistic talent to further weaken and disorient the enemy through music. <br><br>With the power of taunt and curse song, and the tactical use of bard magic, the Hex Blade can reduce enemies to quivering cowards; and once the enemy is hexed, the Hex Blade need merely draw upon his/her fine-tuned blade, to swiftly finish the job. The sooner that evil is foiled, the better it is for the Hex Blade: in between sharpening blades, adventuring and winning battles, this character recuperates through music. Hex Blade is a fighter with a romantic, sensitive side, as an artist, with a high dedication to the study of music composition and performance. This dedication to music has rewarded the Hex Blade with the ability to sing a song of inspiration, to augment self and all those who stand beside him/her, and to strike fear and damage into the hearts and bodies of the enemy. The Hex Blade is an irresistible character, and a welcome addition to any party.  <br><br>Based on the Arthurian Tales and old Celtic lore (the “fighting bard”), this character is a melee character, and built to perform under pressure. When a musician goes off to Knight School, to add blade mastery to his/her talent list, it begs the question: is the song more powerful than the sword? <br><br>The Hex Blade is neutral, preferably, but may be of any non-lawful alignment. The blade, for example, is indiscriminate, but a cold piece of steel; it is a tool that may be used for the forces of “good” or “evil,” or “neutrality,” only as directed by its wielder; when wielded by the Hex Blade, it is sheer poetic mastery. Music, in a sense, is also neutral: it is an art form, and it stirs emotions in the minds and hearts of the audience, without regard to their alignment; when performed by the Hex Blade, it draws its tempo and power from the full range of all that is human thought and experience, and stirs the soul of everyone more-or-less equally. In addition, and as a practical matter, with all this study of the blade and music, the Hex Blade simply has neither the time, nor the inclination, to study the detailed intricacies of the law, or its enforcement, which is an entirely different specialty, requiring a different aptitude and skill set. Instead, the Hex Blade is a weapon master, an epic fighter, and a performance musician; by any other name, Hex Blade is the fighting bard that all medieval minstrels rave about.<br><br>This character is meant to be played through, with skills and feats chosen and balanced accordingly, since it makes little sense to have an ‘ultimate’ shining character, if she/he can’t survive long enough to reach the epic levels. That having been said, players are of course free to pick up the Hex Blade at any level. Astute players will quickly recognize that, as a melee fighting character, the Hex Blade has been gifted with all the strength, feats, and skill-sets that fully qualify as “tank,” but having a touch of the arcane, justifiable by the fact the Hex Blade is an intelligent, performing musician, and thus able to draw upon some of the unique strengths and qualities of the bard. Melee players, especially purists, while enjoying the Hex Blade’s epic fighting prowess and superior longsword mastery, should equally come to appreciate this character’s unique bard assets, providing an arcane touch. This unique blend of skills and abilities that can only be the Hex Blade is designed for the ultimate purpose of producing a character that is exceptionally well suited for team PvP (strategic battle settings, and the like). But he/she is equally suited for solo play, and always up for a dungeon/PvM romp. Because Hex Blade is a tactical fighting specialist, with a sensitive, artistic side, she/he is an uber-build, with very high role-playability. <br><br> <br> <br>HEX BLADE<br>	 <br><br>	Overview<br>Epic Fighter:        22       <br>Ba:                  11 <br>Weapon Master:        7<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Neutral Good Preferred (Any Non-Lawful)	 <br><br>Starting Stats<br>Str:  16<br>Dex: 13<br>Con: 14<br>Wis:   8<br>Int:  13<br>Cha: 12 	<br><br>Final Stats<br>Str:  26<br>Dex: 14<br>Con: 14<br>Wis:   8<br>Int:  13<br>Cha: 16 <br><br><br>Final Skills (unadjusted):<br>Concentration: 42 <br>Discipline :      43<br>Tumble :         30<br>Perform :        18<br>Taunt:            29<br><br>Secondary Skills:<br>Intimidate :      4<br>Listen :            5<br>Spot :              5<br>	<br>Equipment<br>Longsword, Full Plate <br>       AC: 30 (32 self-buffed) [Note: higher with shield, but greater risk of arcane spell failure]. <br><br>Saves:<br>Fort:     22 (23 buffed)<br>Will:     20 (21 buffed)<br>Reflex:  24 (25 buffed)<br><br>Other:<br>HP: 496 (+8, buffed)<br>AB: +41 (+2 song buffed, +2 war cry)<br><br>Bard Spells: Level 4<br><br>	<br><br><br>Mighty Defense and Bard Assets:<br>•	Bard Song: Hex Blade’s innate musical talent have been artfully polished, with the fighting maestro being able to instill the following effects on the audience:  <br>•	Curse Song: all enemy combatants within earshot (30’ area) are cursed, suffering -2 to Attack and Damage Rolls, -1 to Save Rolls (Fort, Will, Reflex), -2 to Skill Rolls, -2 to AC, and -8 HPs (damage);<br>•	Buff Song: the Hex Blade, together with all his allies (within 30’area) are inspired by his song, gaining +2 to Attack and Damage Rolls, +1 to Save Rolls (Fort, Will, Reflex), +2 to Skill Rolls, 8-HPs (temporary), and +2 AC. <br>•	Extra Music and Lingering Song: the Hex Blade carries many songs in his heart and their effects are long lasting; whether it’s a performance being delivered to inspire himself and/or his allies, or curse his foes (or both), the effects of all his songs linger on for many rounds, which can often turn the tides of the battle. <br>•	Access to Bard Spells (4th Level), including WAR CRY, which is a powerful battle cry that strikes instant fear and panic into all enemies within ear-shot, who fail their saving throws; at the same time, the war cry grants Hex Blade a further +2 bonus to his already exceptional Attack and Damage Rolls. <br><br>Devastating Offense and “Deadly Accuracy”: <br><br>•	Epic Longsword Mastery: the Hex Blade is an epic fighter, who has trained long and hard with his longsword, such that he is a master of the blade. His superior longsword focus, combined with his epic longsword focus and epic longsword specialization, means high AB; in short, he accurately hits his target. Coupled with his great strength and epic level fighting expertise (including devastating critical and Ki Critical), he can swiftly bring down his enemies. <br><br>•	Exceptional Attack Bonus: <br>o	Non-Buffed: <br>o	AB: +41/+36/+31/+26 <br>o	Damage: 1-8 +14 (critical 15-20/x3)<br><br>o	Self-Buffed:<br>o	AB: +43/+38/+33/+28<br>o	Damage: as above, +2 Bludgeoning<br><br>Hex Blade's Advantages<br>1.	Exceptional Attack Bonus/Damage: can be raised even further through self-buffing. <br>2.	Devastating Critical: can easily defeat anyone with Devastating Critical when they fail their saving throws against the fear or other debilitating effects of Hex Blade’s Magic (i.e., bestow curse, confusion, war cry, and so forth), which enemy saves can be readily reduced by the curse song; even with saves, enemies will still have to overcome Devastating Critical.<br>3.	Bard/Tactical Fighting Advantages: with numerous bard and curse songs, having long-lasting effects, Hex Blade can strike fear and pandemonium into the hearts and minds of all enemies within ear-shot (battalions, marauding monsters, and swarming gangs of thugs), and regardless whether they are hiding or in plain view.  <br>4.	High AC and High HP: can be raised even further through his music (self-buffing).<br>5.	Bard Knowledge: Full access to 4th-Level Bard Spells, with the innate talent also to use Bard Instruments, arcane wands, and a large variety of magic scrolls. <br><br>Secondary Advantages<br>1.	Can reduce an unlimited number of enemy combatants’ AC, along with their attack and damage rolls, their save and skill rolls, and even lower their HPs (damage), with a single music performance (which perform skill has been maximized). The curse song affects all enemy combatants in the area of effect (30’ area). At the same time, his song can inspire him, and all his allies. In each case, the effects of his musical performance are long lasting (see, above).<br>2.	Can further reduce an enemy’s AC with the Taunt skill, which has been maximized.<br>3.	Sneaking/Hiding characters, and would-be ambushers, cannot avoid the curse song; when it is followed up by the War Cry, Confusion, or any number of his other unique “combat hexing” (bard spell) effects, the Hex Blade will know where they are. <br>4.	Good-to-High Saves all across-the-board, which can be increased through music (self-buffed).<br>5.	High Discipline and High Concentration, which have both been fully maximized.<br><br>Hex Blade's Disadvantages<br>1.	While providing unbeatable defense, the use of full plate and a shield risk high arcane-casting failure; thus, drop his shield before casting any arcane bard spells, equipping it (if necessary) once you move in for combat. Later in the Hex Blade’s career, try switching his heavy armor with something lighter, and take full advantage of his defensive feats (dodge, armor skin, mobility, expertise, spring attack); coupled with good tumbling and his ability to self-buff (see, above), he can cast arcane bard spells with confidence, without worrying about his defense.  <br><br>Secondary Disadvantages<br>1.	Low Spot/Listen: while he has a fine tuned “musical sense”, these partial-skill affinities are not sufficient for him to see adept sneaking creatures/characters (can be avoided, see above).<br><br>Hex Blade's Equipment<br>•	As with all characters of the realm, the Hex Blade would benefit from having access to magical equipment. In addition to typical “fighter” items (e.g., magic armor, keen weapons, strength-boosting items, and items providing damage and magic resistance), the Hex Blade can make full use of bard instruments (lutes, mandolins, lich lyrics), and also arcane wands, and magic scrolls. <br>•	She also has four unused and nearly-available Bard spell slots, including two at 4th level; these can be made readily accessible to her by any item providing a simple boost to her charisma. <br><br>The Hex Blade’s Combat Spells and Epic Career Path:<br>•	Recommended Spells the for the Hex Blade, as a curse song combat warrior, are as follows:<br>o	Level 1: Balagarn's Iron Horn, Charm Person, Grease, Scare<br>o	Level 2:  Cloud of Bewilderment, Ghostly Visage, Sound Burst, Tasha's Hideous Laughter<br>o	Level 3: Bestow Curse, Confusion, Fear, plus one of: Cure Serious Wounds, Invisibility Sphere, or Slow<br>o	Level 4: War Cry <br><br>What follows is the epic path of the Hex Blade, from “battle crier” to “curse song combat warrior”, during the first 40 Levels of his/her career: <br> <br>01: Fighter (1)	- Toughness, Dodge, Power Attack 	<br>02: Fighter (2)	- Cleave	<br>03: Bard (1) - Curse Song	<br>04: Fighter (3) - Cha +1 (Cha 13)<br>05: Fighter (4)	- Weapon Focus: Longsword*(or a weapon of your choice)	<br>06: Bard (2) - Extra Music	<br>07: Fighter (5)	-		<br>08: Fighter (6) - Great Cleave, Str +1 (Str 17)<br>09: Bard (3) - Mobility	<br>10: Fighter (7)	-		<br>11: Fighter (8) - Spring Attack	<br>12: Bard (4) - Expertise, Str +1 (Str 18)<br>13: Fighter (9)	-		<br>14: Fighter (10) - Whirlwind Attack	<br>15: Weapon Master (1) - Improved Critical: Longsword, WoC: Longsword	<br>16: Weapon Master (2) - Str +1 (Str 19)<br>17: Weapon Master (3) -			<br>18: Weapon Master (4) - Iron Will*	<br>19: Weapon Master (5) -			<br>20: Weapon Master (6) - Str +1 (Str 20)<br>21: Weapon Master (7) - Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword	<br>22: Bard (5) -		<br>23: Fighter (11) -		<br>24: Bard (6) - Great Strength I (Str 21), Cha +1 (Cha 14)<br>25: Fighter (12) - Weapon Specialization: Longsword	<br>26: Fighter (13) -		<br>27: Fighter (14) - Great Strength II (Str 22), Epic Weapon Specialization: Longsword	<br>28: Bard (7) - Cha +1 (Cha 15)<br>29: Bard (8) -		<br>30: Fighter (15) - Great Strength III (Str 23)	<br>31: Fighter (16) - Epic Toughness I	<br>32: Fighter (17) - Str +1 (Str 24)<br>33: Fighter (18) - Great Strength IV (Str 25), Overwhelming Critical: Longsword	<br>34: Fighter (19) -		<br>35: Fighter (20) - Devastating Critical: Longsword	<br>36: Fighter (21) - Great Strength V (Str 26), Cha +1 (Cha 16)<br>37: Fighter (22) - Armor Skin	<br>38: Bard (9) - 			<br>39: Bard (10) -	Lingering Song	<br>40: Bard (11) -	Dex +1 (Dex 14)<br><br><br>Skills by level<br><br>01: 4 Concentration, 4 Discipline, 2 Intimidate, 2 Tumble<br>02: 1 Discipline, 1 Taunt (1 Save)<br>03: 6 Perform, 1 Tumble <br>04: 2 Discipline, 1 Intimidate<br>05: 1 Concentration, 1 Discipline, 1 Intimidate<br>06: 3 Perform, 1 Taunt, 2 Tumble<br>07: 2 Concentrate, 2 Discipline<br>08: 3 Concentrate, 2 Discipline<br>09: 3 Perform, 3 Taunt<br>10: 2 Discipline, Save (2)<br>11: 1 Discipline, Save (5)<br>12: 3 Perform, 3 Taunt<br>13: 2 Discipline, Save (2)<br>14: 1 Discipline, Save (5)<br>15: 1 Discipline, Save (8)<br>16: 1 Discipline, 1 Taunt, Save (9)<br>17: 1 Discipline, Save (12)<br>18: 1 Discipline, 5 Listen, 5 Spot, Save (5)<br>19: 1 Discipline, 1 Taunt, Save (6)<br>20: 1 Discipline, 1 Taunt, Save (5)<br>21: 1 Discipline, 1 Taunt, Save (6)<br>22: 1 Concentrate, 1 Discipline, 2 Taunt, 10 Tumble<br>23: 1 Discipline, Save (3)<br>24: 1 Concentrate, 1 Discipline, 6 Taunt, 1 Tumble<br>25: 3 Concentrate, 1 Discipline<br>26: 1 Discipline, Save (3)<br>27: 1 Discipline, Save (6)<br>28: 3 Taunt, 9 Tumble<br>29: 6 Taunt<br>30: 2 Concentrate, 2 Discipline<br>31: 3 Concentrate, 1 Discipline<br>32: 3 Concentrate, 1 Discipline<br>33: 2 Concentrate, 1 Discipline, Save (1)<br>34: 3 Concentrate, 2 Discipline<br>35: 2 Concentrate, 1 Discipline, Save (1)<br>36: 4 Concentrate, 1 Discipline<br>37: 1 Concentrate, 1 Discipline, 1 Spot<br>38: 3 Concentrate, 2 Discipline, 2 Perform<br>39: 2 Concentrate, 1 Discipline, 1 Perform, 2 Tumble<br>40: 2 Concentrate, 1 Discipline, 3 Tumble<br><br><br>* Indicates that feat may be exchanged for one of the player’s choice without detracting from the overall build.<br><br>Author’s Note: The Hex Blade is meant to be played through from the beginning, with feats and skills chosen accordingly; however, he/she may be commenced at level 40, or other level.

Taking WM to 7 is a waste of feats, and taking Fighter to 22 is likewise a waste (most of the time). Take WM to AT LEAST 19.<br><br>Why are you using a longsword?

Your build would be a lot easier to follow if you used the format posted <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "219409", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>here</a> by Griphook <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>A good practice is to list your levelling with the class level in the progression - like so... <br><br>1 Fighter (1):<br>2 Bard (2):<br><br>- or the way I do it, with 3-letter abbreviations for the class names, ie 1 Ftr (1): blah blah.  A format like that makes it easier to critique and refine <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>It's also a good idea for readability's sake to post skill progression seperately or just sum up what the skills end up as at the end of the build.  Not that skills are unimportant, but adding them to the same line as your class, level, feat, and ability point selections makes for a very high density of text.<br><br>Or at least put in seperators between the various parts of a given line.<br><br>As far as your build itself... you could probably gain a lot by dropping dev crit (which will have a relatively low DC with only 26 strength), moving lingering song into the pre-epic levels so you have doubled-duration bardsong for most of your career, rearranging your pre-epic levels so that bard 4 is on level 17 or 18 for a tumble skill dump, and switching some fighter levels for more bard (you're taking an epic toughness, that means you can drop 2 fighter levels in epic because you don't need the feat from them).  With the feats you free up from dropping Dev Crit and moving lingering song to pre-epic, you can probably get your strength to 30.<br><br>If you aren't married to dev crit and want to bypass your spell failure problem altogether, consider changing to a two-hander.  If you are married to dev crit, you'll probably want to change to a scimitar, for the increased threat range.  You'll need to threaten a lot of crits because odds are you'll only beat a fighter or monster type enemy's fort save if they roll a 1.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

You use the format the epic-builds page use, why? It's not like it's very good. The build-page format that is. Don't post the skillpoints in the level-up scheme.<br><br>Where to begin? Starting stats, ending stats. Start with 15 STR and 14 CHA. You save 1 point there, which can be an epic feat. After that, don't raise the CHA further with your level split. All you get after 14 is a 3rd lvl bard spell. <br><br>You use the word exceptional way to much. Exceptional AB and damage? With 26 STR and AB 41 unbuffed? Yeah, right. The word you seek is okay or average.<br><br>Readily reduse the enemies saving throw, you say, to get better use of bard spells and Dev Crit. Your curse song reduce it by 1 point. Will hardly be the turning point of an epic struggle.<br><br>Bard spell choice and Ability-scores. Your spells save DC's will be way to low to select most spells you use, go for more buffing instead of those saveable spells. Plus you ain't got much penetration.<br><br>All that being said about your build, it sure has potential. A better level-split would increase it's power. Fighter18/Bard15/WM7, for example, much better bardsong, more uses, or the same as before without extra music. But the level split I would use with these classes would be Fighter8/Bard16/WM16 or even Fighter6/Bard15/WM19. Then perhaps you could start to talk about exceptional.

Xylo, Cats: Wow! No sooner had I posted this build, and such wonderful interest from you both; it's such a treat to hear from you: thank you. <br><br>You definitely both know your blades, and nice comments. To be sure, I considered the scimitar in light of the strength issue, but my thinking on the issue in choosing a weapon -- any weapon really, need not be "married" to longsword - was as follows: if the Hex is played through, one has to assume he/she will come across an item, such as a giant's belt, that will readily tip this character's STR over 30 (it's only 4 away, and long before DevCrit is even a possibility, even the most mundane mods are replete with +5 belts, etc.). But, for those who want to take it as-is, by all means, you both are dead-on re: the scimitar issue -- and reason why I left the option open as to what weapon a player may wish to focus on (note: toiled over the axe, such a great weapon - got this thought in my mind, can't seem to shake it, that somehow the axe belongs to the barbarian; I know, I know -- silly perhaps, but just can't seem to help it. But for those who like the sound and sight of it, by all means, go for it (ah, the great sword -- just, well, that's for the paladin types (*sigh* I know, getting over it -- <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>As to the bard's "extra music" vs. "lingering song" at pre-epic levels, to be sure, I toiled over that one (very astute, that's so great!). My thinking on that, in switching (literally) between the two feats, making the lingering song pre-epic, but switching it back, then up front again, and then back (did I mention I toiled on that one?!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Reason being was that, given that my vision for this character was as a musician with an innate, raw gift who went off to knight college, that later on, once his blade was mastered, then she/he'd fine-tune his/her music; however, I suppose it wouldn't really make a difference if, pre-epic, this character could give perhaps one heck-of-a-stunning performance and then be wiped out per se, and istead later on acquire the ability to deliver further such performances (ie., the extra music feat). Again, it really was a toss up as to which one to pick, and an excellent comment!<br><br>Ah, as to the ftr vs. wm route -- hmmmm; I know, many prefer to go full wm once there, with many others preferring ftr. I like the ftr for the extra feats and specialization; then, true, could do wm, which has terrific superior focus hands-down. However, because I am one of those folks who enjoy dev crit (again, get the appropriate STR boost, else you're both right, and perhaps I should really clarify that it's a waste of a lot of feats to get DEVCrit without a str boost, but we have to assume players are gonna come across these boost-items, which makes it all the more fun to play, yes? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Otherwise, great catch on both of your parts -- and such a treat to hear -- thanks!<br><br>Ah, as to the format....yes, looking at the "laundry level list" it came out, well, confusingly on this format; looked great, in proper chart form, even had nice graphics on my word file, but just did not translate very well here in the txt format at all. I'll definitely try to re-post to make it clearer, and in doing so, put in your comments about the scimitar (i.e., in the event someone wants to take this guy on epic-plus, so as to make it clear about the weapon issue; again, it was my thought that someone would play it through, but this *IS* an epic board afterall, and you're both so right, must think that some (likely a great many <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  are going to want something from epic on -- again, thanks so much for the tips and critiques, which very much help to clarify and thus make it better. For my next character, I'll definitely check out the suggested format -- thank you soooo much for that, and for both of your comments.<br><br>Your interest, critiques and comment are both so very much appreciated. <br><br>Deborah "Tyr"

Grimm: was just sending off a response, when your critique came in: thank you. It really is such a treat to have such wonderful comments, and so quickly! (And yes, slapping self on wrist re: the way the format came out in txt; as noted above, I'll repost so as to make the level-list, etc. a bit clearer (it really did look wonderful in doc format; will definitely keep this in mind, and clean it up). Sorry, in the meantime.<br><br>Curious about your comment re: bard -- it's my understanding that, with a simple cha boost (ie., a ring or robe, or what have you), that this character would get access to all the 4th level slots, yes? True, the SR at lvl 11 is "okay", ie., low to moderate, but the 3rd and 4th level spells do have a lot of potential. At 3 more Ba levels, he'd definitely be stronger in the arcane/SR department, but would lose DevCrit (again, assuming a Str boost; otherwise, yeah, AB/DevCrit's good, but with more strength . . . ).<br><br>But your comments are well taken; I'll consider working on another version, a "ready-to-go" from epic-levels plus, for those looking to run with a character, rather than develop one and hunt down equipment; these are all very excellent comments and, to this end, encouraging me to provide an alternate version; ie., this one, which is meant to be played from early levels onwards (he is fun, and it's great to pick up equipment), and a second, post-epic version of the hex blade(then again, to be ready and able to run, without having to hunt down equipment <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Thanks so much again, and keep those great comments coming! <br><br>Deborah "Tyr"

The max you can buff one stat is +12, that means the highest your strength can go is 38.  Putting on more strength buffing after that doesn't get applied to your stat bonus - it's a limit imposed by NWN.<br><br>The save DC of dev crit is 1/2 character level + str bonus.  With 26 str your save DC is 28, with 38 str it will be 34.  You can bet that in an environment where dev crit is permitted, other than the campaigns and some single-player modules, most players and most monsters are going to have high fort saves specifically to combat people with devestating critical.<br><br>You can curse song somebody for -1 to their fort save with 11 bard levels... but on dev crit servers the "gold standard" for fort saves is over 40, if not even higher still - so even if they're curse song'd, you won't be beating a lot of enemies' saves.  <br><br>People will use very specific builds and equipment designed specifically to counter dev crit, and builders will favor monsters with high fort saves or immunity to criticals because they don't want their content to be a pushover for anyone who can get 25 strength.<br><br>That's why I suggested the scimitar to at least threaten crits more often.  If you sing, then curse sing, then taunt an enemy you can probably hit them with most of the rolls inside a keen scimitar's WM-expanded threat range - that gives you more chance of your opponent rolling a 1 on their fort save and autofailing.<br><br>In terms of powerbuilding, as Grim noted your build isn't really 'exceptional' - it's average in most ways, with some nice utility from the bard levels.<br><br>You have zero chance of gainfully casting offensive magic with only 11 caster levels and a 16 for your caster stat, however.  The only pseudo-attack spells you should be considering are Darkness and War Cry.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Thanks for not taking my commments as harsh, they might seem so when i read them now. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif"> <br><br>As for more bard levels and losing Dev crit. Start with STR 15 and CHA 14, then drop the epic toughness feat and you can go Fighter18/Bard15/WM7 withouh losing anything but 20 hp's and gaining WAY better bard- and cursesong and more spells.

Xylo: the save DC for Dev Crit is <b>10 + (1/2 character level) + STR modifier</b>. As such, with unbuffed 26 STR, the character's Dev Crit DC is 38, which actually isn't that terrible. Add another 6 for full buffs and you get 44. Maybe not the best, but I've had a Dev Crit character with 28 STR and she landed tons of insta-death hits (and she was dual-wielding bastard swords). It's quite dependent on environment.<br>_________________<br>Where I'm playing now: <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk.</a>

Alright, alright. It would seem that the vote is in, and that the song *is* more powerful than the sword (how wonderful is this, in totally keeping with the theme of the Hex Blade build, which does pose the question re; song vs sword; oh, how marvelous).<br><br>You want to run with an epic character? One with more *umph* to his/her song -- since you asked, I'm happy to deliver. (Thinking I'll repost the alternate version as a challenge, i.e., one as is, with what follows as an alternate path (thanks everyone; on reposting, I'll make sure to source a proper line of credit to all who helped out <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>And now, without further adieu:<br><br>...having mastered his/her blade, and learned all that there was to learn from knight school, our fighting maestro, the Hex Blade, returned to his first love, that of the musical arts; taking his cue from the epic builders guild, . . . <br><br>Fighter(18), Bard(15), Weapon Master(7)<br><br>Bard Level 15:<br>•	Bard Song: +2 to all Saves, +2 to Attack Rolls, +3 Damage, +3 to Skill Rolls, +16 HPs (temporary), and +4 AC<br>•	Curse Song: -2 to all Saves, -2 to Attack Roll, -3 to Damage Rolls, -3 to Skill Rolls, -16 HPs (damage), and -4 AC<br><br>In addition, you will get:<br><br>•	Four (4) additional songs, for a total of 15 per day (or rest period), thus making it unnecessary to take “extra music” above (take “lingering song instead, as noted);<br>•	Five (5) additional spell slots, including access to two (2) spells at 5th level (definite motivation to get out there and hunt down or purchase a CHA-boosting ring or some other such item. With these spells, it's definitely going to be money well spent!).<br><br>At the same time, you’ll retain your AB at +41 (+2 song buffed, +2 war cry which, for a fighter/WM, is high; for a fighting bard, c'mon, thta is exceptional - <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  , plus, you’ll gain an additional point to AC, and even more buffs!<br> <br><br>Change Class/Feats as follows:<br><br>06: Bard(2): Lingering Song<br>28: Bard(7): STR+1, (STR=23)<br>29: Bard(8)<br>30: Fighter(15): Great Strength III, (STR=24)<br>31: Fighter(16): Armor Skin<br>32: Fighter(17): STR+1, (STR=25)<br>33: Fighter(18): Overwhelming Critical: Longsword, Devastating Critical: Longsword<br>34: Bard(9)<br>35: Bard(10)<br>36: Bard(11): CHA+1, Great Charisma I, (CHA=16)<br>37: Bard(12)<br>38: Bard(13)<br>39: Bard(14): Great Strength IV, (STR=26) <br>40: Bard(15): DEX+1, (DEX=14)<br><br><br>HP: 460 (OK, lose a few, but over 450's still high, and then there's the +18 buffed)<br><br>Saves: <br>Fort: 22 (24 buffed)<br>Will:  20 (22 buffed)<br>Reflex: 24 (26 buffed)<br><br> <br>AB: 41 (+2 song buffed, +2 war cry) (no change)<br>AC: 31 (35 buffed) (nice to begin with, now even better!)<br><br>Spell Casting: Bard(5) – (that would be one higher level)<br><br>Final Skills (unadjusted):<br>Concentration 42<br>Discipline 42<br>Perform 24<br>Taunt 29<br>Tumble 35<br><br>Secondary:<br>Intimidate 4<br>Listen 5 <br>Spot 5<br><br>Picking up from level 33, change skills as follows:<br><br><br>34: Concentration(3), Discipline(2), Perform(2), <br>35: Concentration(2), Discipline(1), Perform(2), Tumble(1), <br>36: Concentration(4), Discipline(1), Tumble(1), <br>37: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Perform(2), Spot(1), <br>38: Concentration(3), Discipline(1), Perform(2), <br>39: Concentration(2), Discipline(1), Perform(1), Tumble(2), <br>40: Concentration(2), Tumble(4), <br><br><br>Thanks to everyone who commented once again; see, ask and you shall receive (hey, Hex is a musician after all, he does aim to please <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>Seriously, this is great; and with his STR and DevCrit fully intact, well, that's just....<br><br>Will repost shortly, with credit to all who helped on this second, post-epic version (thanks again).
