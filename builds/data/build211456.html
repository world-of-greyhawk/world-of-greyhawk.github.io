Lately I've been trying to think up weird and wonderful character builds, and this is the first result.  This build is completely untested so far, so I can't post stats like attack bonus and such yet.  It's also my first posted build, so constructive criticism is very welcome.<br><br>Death Rogue<br><br>Elf CN Rogue 25/Wizard 5/Pale Master 10<br><br>Str	10<br>Dex	20 (32)<br>Con	10<br>Wis	8<br>Int	15 (17)<br>Cha     8<br><br>* Rogue or Wizard bonus Feats<br>[#d6] = Sneak Attack Damage<br><br>1	Rogue	Two Weapon Fighting [1d6]<br>2	Rogue<br>3	Rogue	Weapon Finesse	[2d6]<br>4	Wizard	+1 Int<br>5	Wizard<br>6	Rogue	Ambidexterity<br>7	Rogue	[3d6]<br>8	Rogue	Point Blank Shot, +1 Int (17)<br>9	Wizard  <br>10	Wizard<br>11	Wizard(5)	Combat Casting*<br>12	Pale Master	+1 Dex (21)<br>13	Pale Master<br>14	Pale Master<br>15	Pale Master	Rapid Shot<br>16	Pale Master	+1 Dex (22)<br>17	Pale Master<br>18	Pale Master	Improved Two Weapon Fighting<br>19	Pale Master(8)<br>20	Rogue(7) +1 Dex (23) [4d6]	<br>21	Pale Master	Great Dex I (24)<br>22	Pale Master(10)<br>23	Rogue<br>24	Rogue(9) Great Dex II, +1 Dex (26)[5d6]<br>25	Rogue	Improved Evasion*<br>26	Rogue	[6d6]<br>27	Rogue	Great Dex III (27)<br>28	Rogue	Defensive Roll*, +1 Dex (28), [7d6]<br>29	Rogue<br>30	Rogue	Epic Dodge, [8d6]<br>31	Rogue	Crippling Strike*<br>32	Rogue	+1 Dex (29) [9d6]<br>33	Rogue	Great Dex IV (30)<br>34	Rogue	Slippery Mind*, [10d6]<br>35	Rogue(20)<br>36	Rogue	Self Concealment I,+1 Dex (31), [11d6]<br>37	Rogue	Skill Mastery*<br>38	Rogue	[12d6]<br>39	Rogue	Self Concealment II, Self Concealment III*<br>40	Rogue	Opportunist*, +1 Dex (32), [13d6]<br><br>tested it in a character builder mod.

I like the build, personally I have never seen this before. I would recommend raising your intelligence to 18 so that you gain 43 extra skill points, more spell slots and gain the full opportunity to use your level 8 spells.

However, that would not get you to level 8 spells.  10 pale master levels would be the equivalent in terms of spell levels and spells per day of 5 wizard levels.  With 5 levels of wizard and 10 levels of pale master, this build would have the spell levels and spells per day of a level 10 wizard.  So, he'd have 5th level spells.<br><br>However, your actual caster level does not increase with pale master levels.  He'll have 5th level spells and the slots of a 10th level wizard, but in terms of damage, duration, and spell penetration, he will be considered a 5th level caster.  So, his Fireball would still only do 5d6 damage, Haste would only last 5 rounds, and spell penetration checks would be 5+1d20, etc.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 09/06/05 02:34</span></i></p>
