In Epic levels of Fist of Raziel, you get a bonus feat every 3 lvls and another Smite Evil <b>every other odd level.</b> Great Charisma and Great Smite are feat choices as well.  Say hello to a character that finishes with 17 (or is it 18) Smite Evils empowered with Great Smite X <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">     <br><br>race: Human (our PW is preparing to go PrC, but the races will not be enabled, just the classes, otherwise, prolly aasimar.)<br><br>Initial Stats<br><br>STR 14-&gt;18<br>DEX 8<br>CON 10<br>WIS 12<br>INT 10<br>CHR 18-&gt;26<br><br>1) Paladin Power Attack Cleave<br>2) Paladin<br>3) Paladin Weapon Focus Scimitar*<br>4) Paladin CHR +1<br>5) Paladin<br>6) Paladin Divine Might<br>7) Fist of Raziel<br>8 )FofR  CHR +1<br>9) FofR  Extra Turning <br>10) FofR <br>11) FofR<br>12) FofR Divine Shield CHR +1<br>13) FofR<br>14) FofR<br>15) FofR Extend Spell**<br>16) FofR CHR+1<br>17) CoT<br>18 )CoT Extra Smiting*** Improved Crit Scimitar*<br>19) CoT<br>20) Paladin CHR +1<br>21) FofR Great Charisma I<br>22) FofR <br>23) FofR Great Charisma II<br>24) CoT Great Smite I and II, CHR +1<br>25) FofR<br>26) FofR<br>27) FofR Great Smite II and IV<br>28) FofR STR +1<br>29) FofR<br>30) FofR Great Smite V and VI<br>31) FofR<br>32) FofR STR +1<br>33) FofR Great Smite VII and VIII<br>34) FofR <br>35) FofR<br>36) FofR Great Smite IX and X, STR +1<br>37) FofR<br>38 )FofR<br>39) FofR Armor Skin, Epic Weapon Focus Scimitar*<br>40) FofR<br><br>Skills****<br>Discipline 39<br>Concentration 38<br>Tumble 20 (cross class)<br>persuade 5 (FofR requirement)<br>lore 5 (FofR requirement)<br><br>*I chose scimitar to post, but I am also considering battleaxe and warhammer.  I thought I had heard that Divine Shield had switched from dodge AC to shield AC in the PrC (I forgot to check when I was building this in the Halls of Advanced Training.)  If that is true, I will do one of Great Axe, Great Sword, or Heavy Flail.<br><br>** EDIT: Fit in extend spell and took Improved Crit with the CoT lvl.  Doubled my Divine Powers, which will be needed as my norm AB will be kinda low. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>***Ok, for some reason, the 2 extra smites you get from Extra Smite do not show on your quickbar from the Fist of Raziel radial.  Drag the three that will show from either your Pally or your CoT radial next to the ones from the Fist, then go find something evil to smite.  I found a zombie.  I smote him from my FofR quickbar, and my number (15) of smites in the FofR quickbar did not decrease, but they did from my Pally slot.  Same thing the second time.  I believe they both went down on the third one, and then I had 14 more smites before I ran out.  It is possible that I only used the pally one the third time, though, and had 15 left.  Either way, that is a crap ton of Smite Evils.<br><br>****The PW on which I play has many monsters that taunt, hence the high concentration.  I would most likely choose taunt otherwise.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.rpgmods.net/forgottenworlds/phpBB2/" target="_blank">Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Yar Stardawg on 04/14/05 20:06</span></i></p>

Looks nice, I hope that the critters on your PW are evil <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
