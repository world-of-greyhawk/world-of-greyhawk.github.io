Just a quick question: In a PvP environment, what would be a better build: Sor3/Pal26/RDD11 or Sor9/Pal20/RDD11?<br><br>The first gets two bonus feats and undispellable Paladin spells, while the second gets more Sorc spells for yummy buffs like Displacement and Keen Edge. Base AB and AC are the same, though the Pal26 version will have slightly more HP.<br><br>Note that it's one or the other. I've got the builds planned out completely and am not going to change anything. Just asking which you thing will be more effective in PvP.

Just out of curiosity, would you mind explaining why you take 11 RDD?  10 seems adequate in most cases.  Not asking you to change your build order, just curious.<br><br>While the extra Sorc spells seem very tempting, I'm always nervous about things getting dispelled.  Though keen edge is a very nice addition to be sure.  What epic paladin feats do you take for the Pal 26 build?

The 11th RDD level isn't strictly necessary, but taken at the 40th character level it allows me to max out a bunch of useful skills at once. Not a big difference with taking a Sorc and Pal level as 39th and 40th, but especially in the Pal20 version neither Sorc nor Pally would give me anything useful in one extra level (I'm not really interested in 5th level Arcane spells). In the Pal26 version I'd probably go Sor4/Pal26/RDD10, now that I think about it. That would give me one 2nd level spell, which I could put to good use.<br><br>For the Pal26 build I'd move Epic Weapon Focus and Epic Prowess to the bonus feats and take 2 Great Charisma feats in stead. I've got all the feats I want even without the bonus feats, but +1 CHA modifier is never a bad thing for a Pally.

In a PvP enviroment spells like Keen Edge are more of the time easily obtainable. If its Party PvP then maybe your teammate could buff you up too. Specialized builds are always more viable for pvp. Focusing on Paladin levels would be better, because in pvp a Jack of all Trades becomes way too stretched out.<br><br>But do whatever you want. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br><br>-Dark<br>_________________<br>They were all dead.

Why are you not interested in lvl 5 arcane spells?

<b>* Animate dead</b><br>Useless<br><b>* Ball lightning</b><br>Useless<br><b>* Bigby's interposing hand</b><br>Would be nice, but has to be used in combat, when I will be wearing Full Plate and possibly a shield.<br><b>* Cloudkill</b><br>Useless<br><b>* Cone of cold</b><br>Useless<br><b>* Dismissal</b><br>Useless<br><b>* Dominate person</b><br>Useless<br><b>* Energy buffer</b><br>Kinda nice, but the short duration makes it less useful.

Besides, my Will save will be high. The duration is short.<br><b>* Lesser planar binding</b><br>Useless<br><b>* Lesser spell mantle</b><br>Half-decent, but my best defense against spells are my high saves.<br><b>* Mind fog</b><br>Useless<br><b>* Mestil's acid sheath</b><br>I admit this spell is nice, even at this low caster level. But with a duration of 10 rounds it's usefulness drops, especially since I can't reliably cast it once combat begins and I can't swap out my armor anymore.<br><b>* Summon creature V</b><br>Useless<br><br>So most spells are either useless for this character or have too short a duration (Turn/level or Round/level) to be effectively used as pre-battle buffs. Earlier levels have a few nice, longer duration spells (Keen has 10minutes/level, Stoneskin has Hour/level), and/or some spells that can be cast in armor (True Strike, Darkness, Displacement). Level 5 has none of that.

Good reply. I was thinking of my Pal20/Sorc10/PM10 build, which uses the PM slots to cast lvl 5 spells stilled. In your case you can't. O think I would get PAL26 then.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

And you don't get anything extra for RDD 12, so it's an easy choice to make.
