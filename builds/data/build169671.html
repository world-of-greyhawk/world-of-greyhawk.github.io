<b>Playable from level 1 - 40</b><br><br>Hey all.<br><br>It turns out that after the new patch, the COT bonus feats have been changed from every 3 lvls to every 4 lvls.  I had posted a dru/sht/cot build before that had 18 lvls of cot.  Taking into account the above info and realizing that the cha of my other build isnt terribly high (and secretly wishing to make him more powerful) I post this version.<br><br>The original idea was to make use of the RIsen Lord shape and Drow elf shape.  Why?  I like the look of the drow!  and having a +6 wpn infinitly is a nice idea.. especially if you live on pws that are considered low magic.  The risen lord, well, cuz he's the boss, imho.<br><br>I also saw a post for rakasha build shifters and would have loved to work that aspect into this guy, but alas i was only able to squeeze 13 druid lvls, allowing an empowered Ice storm vs the maximized ice storm..  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">      Oh well.. so here is  my 3 shape focus shifter.<br><br>Elf : taking elf gives you longsword for wpn foc.. as well as a pretty strong melee char until epic lvls when you get your main shapes.<br><br>str 13   dex 10  wis 17  Int 10  con 10  Cha 14<br><br>Stats are taken to give you melee presence, enough wis to get Outsider shape, and the cha to get some use from the COT lvls.<br><br>1 dru1        alertness<br>2 dru2<br>3 dru3        Power attack<br>4 dru4                            w18<br>5 dru5<br>6 shf1        cleave<br>7 shf2<br>8 shf3                            w19<br>9 shf4        wpn foc: Longsword<br>10 shf5<br>11 shf6<br>12 cot1       wpn prof:exotic     w20<br>13 cot2       wpn foc: scythe<br>14 cot3<br>15 cot4       improv crit: longsword + scythe<br>16 cot5                           w21<br>17 cot6       great cleave<br>18 cot7       Toughness<br>19 cot8       Blind Fight<br>20 cot9                           w22<br>21 shf7       epic wpn foc: longsword *drow shape*<br>22 shf8<br>23 shf9<br>24 shf10      UNDEAD SHAPE        w23<br>25 cot10      epic wpn foc: scythe<br>26 shf11<br>27 shf12      Great wis I       <br>28 shf13*     OUTSIDER SHAPE      w25<br>29 shf14<br>30 shf15      Empower spell<br>31 shf16*     Great wis II<br>32 shf17      **epic drow-infinite times/day** w 27<br>33 dru6       Epic prowess<br>34 dru7<br>35 dru8<br>36 dru9       Armor skin           w28<br>37 dru10<br>38 dru11<br>39 dru12      Extend spell<br>40 dru13                           w29<br><br>skills  concentration, discipline, tumble 21<br><br>Oh, and isnt it sweet!  A shifter with 4 atts/rd!!<br><br>I took extend spell at the end because i realized that the druid lvls r not really that high to give lots of time for buffs.  As you can see, this build is melee based, it is nice to have empowerd ice storm on the quick bar for those moments of mass destruction!!<br><br>If you see any improvements, i am happy to hear bout them.  <br><br>Peace<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 02/28/08 19:58</span></i></p>
