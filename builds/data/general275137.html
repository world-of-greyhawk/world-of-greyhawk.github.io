ok so I spent all day writing a perl program to extract all of the epic builds.

well, from what Pulscap told me, the list has to be in a certain format for him to be able to parse it for his build search engine webpage.<br><br>I believe it was being done manually.

When I said yes to moderate I did it only if I didn't have to do the buildupdates. It's true you only need to edit the post, but it's damn time-consuming still.

well, if you want, I can give you the perl program I wrote.  works great on linux.  haven't tested or ever done any windows perl stuff.<br><br>it's really easy to run.<br><br>the way I currently have it set up is that you:<br><br>-view each page of builds one at a time<br>-do a view-page-source<br>-save that to a file (number them uniquely)<br>-make a text file with all of the filenames in it (one per line)<br>- run my program and pass in the text file as a command line parm.<br>- redirect the output to an html file ( &gt;outfile.html )<br><br>that's it.<br><br>it will spit out valid lists of user builds. A) B) ... AA) , AB) .. etc<br><br>I tried to do a cut and paste into a message to show the example, but the bioware site complained about "line to long" with no spaces.  that was for the link.  still trying to figure that one out.

Still here... somewhat. Been damn busy with my job and life. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>Anyway, if everyone here really wants the index to be updated... anyone is quite welcome to summit me the list of new builds and I will add them, or, if the moderators here feels up to it, they are welcome to do so. (But to be sure... PLEASE back up the list before you attempt to modify the list!) That was directed at the moderators.. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif"> <br><br>If they are willing, send them the list as well. If they prefer not to mess with it, they can send the list to me instead or knock me on my head to remind me to update the build list and I will try to do it during the weekends. But as many said... it is time consuming to do, so any help is appreciated.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.

That's what I mean, the thing is, I'm not blaming Anuis, Kail, Finn, Cinn or Grim for not doing it, but if nobody is willing to do it, or nobody is capable of doing it, then "hire" someone who does.<br><br>Anybody else noticed how Bromium was self appointing himself? I mean, I want the list updated but I was too lazy to do something about it. If he's willing to do it then make him a mod to let him do it, that's the most practical solution, and everybody is happy dragging the work to someone else (admit it)... anybody doesn't wants him to be a mod for a particular reason?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/26/07 02:18</span></i></p>

Well, he has 801 total posts in the NWN Forums.  That is actually in his favor since it is an indication that he only posts when he has a question, answer or constructive feedback.<br><br>On the other hand, he has only 2 builds listed in the Index.  Both Shifters.  That will go against him (and yes, I am aware of the irony that he probably has more that have not yet been indexed).<br><br>But still, his join-by date for the Guild was in '02, which is way earlier than most of these other upstarts.<br><br>He doesn't appear to have a reputation for flippancy, or flaming.  My contacts have stated that he hasn't received any Bans from Board Admins here at Bioware, and his profile suggests that he is some sort of computer programmer, which means he'll be with us until carpal tunnel kicks in.<br><br>I give him the green light.  All in favor, say "aye."

I'd be willing to give an update a shot. I'm not scared, just lazy, I guess (actually, for some reason I didn't think I had the mojo to do it.

Three cheers for Bromium and his innovative computer indexer ... (I say "aye" and to all his shapes, but does that break the rules of democracy, in so far as 1 person can only cast 1 vote for 1 candidate? With all these shifters, it's hard to know!

Well done, Bromium! Just a couple things: <br><br>Any build title with class levels ending with an 8 ) that doesn't have a space between the eight and the bracket is showing the <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif">   emote. (There are a few in my list).

There's something odd happening. After you get to the 'Z' member names, the list starts again from 'A'.

On my end it's a perl program running on linux.<br><br>I open firefox and view each page of builds (38 total) and "view page source" on each one.  I then safe that HTML to a file.  I pump those 38 files into my perl program to filter for author and build name.  I also apply some hard coded remaping for authors (builds posted by Mr X on behalf of Mrs Y).  I also fix up some build name issues too.<br><br>I ouput text in the proper format that the bioware msg board takes (for links) and then I cut and paste into a few posts.<br><br>That's about it.<br><br>Pulse uses the index page and could better explain his end of things.<br><br>We are having a few issues with bad build names (no class or levels given).

Kail, in the index there are 8 sections of names.  I'll take the first 4 sections and fix all of the bad names.

Hullo.<br><br>For those who don't remember me, I'm that guy who should be updating the search thingy but, you know.. erm.. isn't. I'm finally sorta working on it again though. The problem is that my old program can't really deal with the new index page format as it's dependent on the manual fixing-up work that went into the old index page. Now if I run it will just give me quite a long list of complaints and refuse to generate any useful output, ie neatly organized and indexed data for the PHP side of things.<br><br>Anyways, I think I've finally worked out how to make the project complicated enough that I won't lose my concentration as has happened with several similar attempts in the past. This is, of course, a rather inefficient solution to the problem of my lack of focus, but it does sometimes work and at least I typically learn something.<br><br>So I guess that's it for now. Just letting you guys know I'm alive and such. Well, that and rambling anyway.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By pulse cap on 02/11/08 20:51</span></i></p>
