After looking through Pulse Caps search engine:<br><br>Found: Evo_dragon's PaleMaster Archer: Bard(5), Arcane Archer(19), Pale Master(16)<br><br>First thing is this will be my first time making an AA, and i gotta say this build looks great.  However, I need to make some minor changes if you want to call it that.<br><br>Looking for some advise:  <br><br>- I need to lose the Epic Warding <br>     (nothing i can do about it)<br>     <br>- What should be replaced by it? <br><br>- If I reduce the PM Levels to 10, I should be able to keep Epic Mage Armor?  <br>  Do I increase my AA levels?  Is there any benefit to doing that?

You need at least 15 levels of Palemaster to keep Epic mage armor, but since you don't want Epic Warding, then drop Palemaster down to 10 and replace it with AA, every uneven level in AA will give +1 AB and dmg. You also get bonus feats at AA level 22. You'll lose the PM bonus feat at lvl 13 and 16 though.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 06/22/06 14:09</span></i></p>

You'll also lose 4 AC, if it matters to you.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...

If you want epic mage armor from PM, you'll need at least15 PM lvls. You can take it on a normal feat if you take your 15th PM lvl at that lvlup, or you can take it as the bonus feat you get at PM lvl 16.<br>If you can do without, I'd drop 6 PM lvls and rather take AA instead. <br>You will lose +4 AC and 2 epic PM feats. The PM feat at PM lvl 13 has little to offer (some elemental resistance) but the bonus feat at PM lvl 16 can give you an epic spell if your spellcraft is high enough.<br><br>You will gain +3 to AB and damage from 6 AA levels. You will also get an epic bonus feat at AA lvl 22 as noted above.<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan
