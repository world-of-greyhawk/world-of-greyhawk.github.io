Hello one and all...<br><br>I know this might have been asked before but my search-fu is weak so my apologies if that's the case.<br><br>Anywho, to the point i'm posting this is that i wanted to ask all you great minds here that would there ever be a point of making a whip wielding Ftr/WM with a possible Dev (besides some possible RP/Concept reasons) or would the character just be incredibly weak and not worth the trouble as whips ain't exactly high dmg?<br><br><br>So, what is the opinion of ye all? Too weak to be bothered with or a worthwhile investment?<br><br>//Also, my apologies if this is the wrong place for this etc... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

Well, I'd have to say that selecting is done for RP reasons.  The weapon does not do much damage (even when multiplied by a crit), the crit range is not very good, and cost of "Exotic" feat also hurts.<br><br>If you are selecting Whip, it's because you want to look cool when you sting your adversary.<br><br>A Dev Crit Whip will not be the same as a Dev Crit Rapier.<br><br>I've got a Sinister Whip build that has Monk/Blackguard/Assasin.

I never liked the whip implementation, don't like really anything about it, don't understand why it sucks so much or why the hell did they wanted to add a weapon with such a low damage dice, sheesh, it's amazingly odd to say the least, since I'm a powerbuilder I always think of a cualitative advantage where the whip offers none IMO. <br><br>However, nobody said you can't take whip and be strong, a strong build will be strong anyway, even if it's comparatively better to take another weapon that never means the build sucks, except you're crazy enough to use a whip with a monk, no offense intended to anyone but that's the only one position where it would be really extremely stupid to do so, and I will explode if I ever see that... or kill him on the spot.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

To have more damage options and still get Dev. crit you could go Fighter/Weapon Master with Rogue or Assassin levels. I made a build before that was dual wield, whip in one hand, short sword in the other. Not posted on here though. I have to go to work now, but I can "whip" something up for you later if you want.

It doesn't have to read "Whip" in the build name, you can just get a WM build you like and change it to use a whip.<br>_________________<br>" -- They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then it's night once more."<br><br> - Pozzo in Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett

I know I did a whip build that was posted.  If you search under my name in the list you will find it (not too many builds)   I believe I used the assassin class to get extra damage.  With a whip, that is the key.  Sneaks!  A wm whip with dev crit.. hmmm   would be something to see a whip KILL instantly!  I am playing a build right now that is a super dev crit build (using the prc mod)  It is designed to have dev crit at lv 21 and end with a str of 38 (great str 10), so with the +12 from str itms, you get a dc of 55!  LMAO   that would be such a GREAT thing to see!  A dragon taken down by a whip!  <br><br>It would be HELL getting to 40 though, unless you can get some nice MAGIC on a whip.<br><br>Hope that helps<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Don't forget about the Epic Lizardfolk Whipmaster via Shifter.  His whip is +5 Epic Shocking Whip, +2d8 electrical, +5 slashing, OnHit: Stun (DC=26) 10% 4 rounds.  <br><br>Should be a pretty decent way to take Weapon Focus and Improved Crit: Whip, and maybe even work some Fighter goodness in their as well (WS/EWS/Overwhelming)<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
