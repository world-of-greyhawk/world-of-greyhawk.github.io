Hey, this is my first character build, and I wanted to make it a good one. This build is basically an assassin and a decent fighter all rolled into one, with very good sneak attacks and decent ab. Here we go...<br><br>Name: Angel of Death<br>Race: Elf<br>Stats: Str 17--&gt;27<br>Dex 15<br>Con 10<br>Wis 10<br>Int 14<br>Cha 8<br>Fighter 11/Weapon Master 10/Assassin 19<br>Configure your first level so it looks like this:<br>1 Fighter-dodge, Expertise<br>2 Fighter-Mobility<br>3 Fighter-spring attack<br>4 Fighter-Weapon Focus Dagger<br>5 Fighter-<br>6 Fighter-Whirlwind, Weapon Spec dagger, Take 4 Intimidate<br>7 WM-Weapon of Choice<br>8 WM-<br>9 WM-ambidexterity<br>10 WM-<br>11 WM-<br>12 WM-two weapon fighting<br>13 WM-<br>14 WM-<br>15 WM-Improved Critical Dagger<br>16 WM-<br>17 Fighter-<br>18 Fighter-Power Attack, Cleave<br>19 Fighter-<br>20 Fighter- Great Cleave<br>21 Assassin- Improved Two Weapon Fighting<br>22 Assassin-<br>23 Assassin-<br>24 Assassin- Overwhelming Crit<br>25 Assassin-<br>26 Assassin-<br>27 Assassin-Great Str<br>28 Assassin-<br>29 Assassin-<br>30 Assassin-Dev. Crits<br>31 Assassin-<br>32 Assassin-<br>33 Assassin- Epic Weapon Focus<br>34 Assassin- Great Dex.<br>35 Assassin-<br>36 Fighter- Epic Weapon Spec.<br>37 Assassin-<br>38 Assassin-<br>39 Assassin-Improved Sneak Attack 1&amp;2<br>40 Assassin-Max out tumble, hide, move silently, spot, and whatever else you want.<br><br>Thats it really. What I got in the end was an assassin who was very fast, with 5(?) attacks per round,( I think), and could hold his own in a fight. Ac is not amazing really, definately could use some improvements. Overall, this build needs some help, especially if used in a pvp setting. well, review and flame!

Rogues get +2 skillpoints per level, evasion and 2 extra bonus feats. When you compare that to a couple of spells (which the rogue can cast through UMD) and death attack, the rogue seems far superior.<br><br>    Quote: <br>    4 Fighter-Weapon Focus Dagger<br><br><br>You would do more damage with a short sword.<br><br>    Quote: <br>    36 Fighter- Epic Weapon Spec.<br><br><br>Take the fighter level at 39, that way you can take 42 discipline.<br><br>Just a quick critque. With some work, this could be a good build .<br>_________________<br>If time flies when you're having fun, then timed essays must be hilarious.<br><br>Edited By Mithdradates on 04/11/04 10:32:13
