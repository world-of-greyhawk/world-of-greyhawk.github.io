Yeah, as the name says and implies, a real pain in the @$$ basically.  Theres xp penalties, and trying to balance stats, but I'd like to see it.  And not one of the 1 monk level types, or just 2 level's of a class, I'd like to see him well versed in the 3. (ie. 4 level's of a class at the absolute min, I was thinkin 9M, some split of the rest for the other 2)  High Magic enviornment...<br>I'm picturing A staff of sorts for a weapon, and for the domains and what not, this guy is gonna be all about the buffs to help with his melee, and able to throw some mean offensive spells out there.  Hopefully he will utilize those to a workable build, and if not he'll be a great magic writer, being able to make Wiz. and Cleric spell books etc...<br>Real interested to see what turns up...

First of all, here's my Monk/Cleric/Wizard build, I hope you like it: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "249788", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Magic Master (Monk 2 / Cleric 17 / Wizard 21)</a> might help you visualize around what the spread can become.<br><br>Now, don't take this wrong, but if you're taking monk you should use a kama as a weapon, and I don't care if you don't like it because if you don't use it's simply stupid to take Monk in the first place, man, what's the point if you want to waste all that AB/APR bonus!?<br><br>Look, you can take 6 monk levels for Improved Knockdown, which is understandable as non-cheese monk taking just 1 level, but seriously, I tink it's not worth it, when you make a Wizard/Cleric/X build <b>you don't have enough levels</b> the last thing you want is wasting levels for no reason, this kind of build needs about 50 levels to get its max, but that's impossible so you have to sort it out as best as you can. Nimueh Leafbow said he used a Wizard17/Cleric17/Monk6 spread, he's a great builder so I'm pretty sure it will work, IKD is a nice feat, but the loss of spell slots is considerable, I don't think it's worth it, but do as you like.<br><br>If you want to use a non-kama so much, you can use it in the same way, but I'd suggest taking Bard or Fighter instead of Monk in that case. If kamas are banned in your PW then I apologize for the rudeness of my post regarding weapons, but you didn't specify that.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/18/06 04:31</span></i></p>

This is for the DLROH server, a Dragonlance based PW. Mages must follow many of the same rules they do in the books, so unless he wants to go renegade he must limit his weapons to dagger/staff and wear robes. And the server rules also dictates that you have at least 4 levels of each class, as he says.<br><br>Yes, jobluntz, I am the Grimnir from DLROH. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

Good to know, then why do you want Monk? 4-6 levels of Fighter or Bard will net you more than Monk in this case. With minimum 4 levels and no kamas, I say you should stay only with Cleric/Wizard.

I appreciate the responses...<br>Figure'd it was you Grim, Good to see ya', now play more!<br><br>As for the build, I was just playing with build ideas in my head, maybe switchin monk for bard would be nice...<br>The original concept was more based on the classes themselves than the abilities/feats that come with them.  I've cranked out a bunch'a characters based on the feats they'd receive, I figure'd now I'd do one based on an idea of who they are (A monk from a monastery has an infatuation with the divine, he studies magic, and then finds religion... etc. or what ever <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  ) <br>Just figure'd it'd be nice to see what came up operating in the limitations set out before hand.<br>And Thax, I had looked at your build and a few others, I did like them and thought of using it, with a little customization, but as you were pointing out, it's hard to make what I was looking for with the pre-laid out requirements, and I don't mind people being frank, this is a forum/guild for improving on building, hard to do that without constructive criticism <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br>But back on point...  I'd like to see what Leafbow suggested, did'nt get a peek at that, I'll start looking after this, and maybe I'll check out that bardish build too, if someone wants to post that'd be great...<br>Thanks!<br><br>Edit/PS<br>If I have builds I've been tweaking/working on, where should I post them to get a bit of feedback as to the overall setup, and suggestions as to further tweaking?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By jobluntz on 12/19/06 15:41</span></i></p>
