I'm toying around with the cleric class lately and I tried to build one over the dispel cap, able to pierce SR (monks apart, of course), with a high save DC, focusing (guess what?) on implosion <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"> <br>Melee presence is granted by divine power+buffs (that's why BAB was intentionally kept at 25). Fighter was chosen to get martial weapon right from the start +WS/EWS.CoT for save boosting and bonus feats (foregoing the CHA related special abilities).<br>Starting STR could be lower but I wanted to have some carrying capacity without buffs and to make earlier lvls easier.<br>Domains were chosen for the extra spells of course(mage armor, barkskin help at lower lvls, stoneskin, icestorm and creeping doom are always handy)<br>Expertise/Improved expertise to pump up AC while casting spells (even on PWs where they switch it off while casting exp deactivates after you cast not before or during eh-eh...just reactivate it immediately after casting and your AC will always be +5/10).<br>Here we go<br><br><b>Cleric(26), Champion of Torm(10), Fighter(4)</b><br>Human, any non

You've got all the nice cleric buffs, you're undispellable, unresistable (monks apart), have a good spell DC and your saves (especially gainst spells) are good. Buff yourself up, turn improved expertise on and implode 'em all <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> <br>If that is not enough you have a decent array of spells to deal with them. Getting the trickery domain is not a bad idea either, improved invisibility will let you get among your enemies ranks and implode them before they know what's going on.

I understand from the lack of feedback that the build is good as it is...or at least I want to understand it is <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br>I hope you enjoy it<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail

sorry, but i don't see much to say.  looks like you did what you set out to do.  strong cleric with sone cot and a little fighter to grab EWS.  nothing earth shattering, but a solid and stable cleric.<br><br>well done, overall.  perhaps dumping some points into con instead of everything to wis, so that you can take a few more hits, but otherwise, nothing really to contribute.  you should last longer than most mages, but still be able to do decent melee because of DP as well as AoE spells.<br><br>-c

Thanks, I just wondered whether someone would make different choices regarding feats and/or lv split or even the classes to use. I see the benefits of my choices but another builder could see things in a way <br>I don't and have ideas to improve the build. That's all.<br>Thank again for the input, Chris<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Well I did my version of this with the Death From Below halfling cleric 38/SD 1/monk 1 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   And, more closely to this build, the caster variant of the Crusader of Torm.<br><br>You've got a solid cleric build going on here.  Not the same tack I took in either of my caster-cleric builds but it will certainly be effective magically and physically.  Implode is just evil with a max-DC cleric, I still whip out my halfling of doom on occasion just because it's so deliciously dastardly to blow things up with it.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
