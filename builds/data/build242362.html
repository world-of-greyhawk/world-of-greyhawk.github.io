When I see this build I think of an archer in a party, using a mighty shortbow for added damage and the party to distract so he can land sneak attacks.<br>The bardsong will improve the whole party, but you also move close enough in combat to use curse song along with your sneak attacks. Tumble and epic dodge let you move around in battle without getting hit too often, and wounding whispers will harm the ones actually hitting you.<br><br>I'd take extend spell instead of still, to make the short time buffs last longer.<br>I'd also take point blank- and rapid shot to get there, but that's just the way I see a build like this one.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

I'm not really sure what to make of this build... your AC is good and your saves are decent, but your AB and hitpoints are lower than I'd want to see on a melee character.<br><br>The short of it is that I don't know if taking RDD in a dex build is doing you many favors - it does increase your AC and carrying capacity and give you some bonus damage for fighting what you can't sneak attack.  But your build seems pretty feat starved and I think you'd probably be better off with some bonus feats, like from COT.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Hm, when you take RDD, then utilize it's bonuses to fullest, which is strength. It would really improve your AB. You would lose AC, of course, but I agree with Xylo. If you're not going STR, take something alse for third class, like CoT.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.
