Hi guys.<br>First off - this is my first post here so if I’m not following some guidelines on posting please let me know.<br><br>I usually don’t make dual wielding builds as I think the extra AC and +2 Attack Bonus you get from one weapon and a shield compared to two weapons easily beats the extra two attacks per round at -2 ab. But there’s a problem. I have this neat Two-bladed Sword that is quite unique on the server I play on and I want to use it. I’ve tried different build combinations to find what suits me best and I have concluded that a Ranger combination is necessary. Fighter/WM/Rogue is ok, but when I’m using Two-bladed Sword I have to go strength based. And because of the 15dex requirement for Ambidexterity any build I’ve made that does not include Ranger lacks out on ab.<br><br>The following is an explanation of what is required at the server I play.<br>	Basically I need a PvM build. Leveling difficulty is not any concern of mine just as long as the build is strong at level 40. At level 40 I need +50 ab to hit monsters, so that is a requirement. AC is not that important, as I have equipment to make up for that (mostly +5 and +6), but to give an idea of the difficulty, 60 and 90 AC are milepoles. Good saves are a bonus, but not vital.<br><br>The build I have come up with so far is a Ranger14/Cleric24/SD2. The 2 lvls of SD is mainly to max out tumble with a class that does not incur XP penalty. Maxed Hide and MS for the fun of it, even though TS is rather common. Build breakdown is listed underneath.<br><br>Ranger (lvl 14), Cleric (lvl 24), Shadow Dancer (lvl 2)<br><br>Human, Lawful Neutral<br><br>PvM<br><br>STR: 15 (24)<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 15 (20)<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 428<br>Skillpoints: 214<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Reflex/Will): 24/24/17<br>BAB: 28<br>AB (max, naked): 36 (melee), 29 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 19/30<br>Spell Casting: Cleric(9),Ranger(4)<br><br>SKILLS<br>Concentration 43(44), Hide 43(44), Move Silently 43(44), Spellcraft 40(41), Tumble 40(40)<br><br><br>LEVELING GUIDE<br><br>01: Ranger(1): Weapon Proficiency Exotic, Toughness, Favored Enemy: Undeads<br>02: Ranger(2)<br>03: Ranger(3): Weapon Focus: Two-bladed Sword<br>04: Ranger(4): STR+1, (STR=16)<br>05: Ranger(5): Favored Enemy: Giants<br>06: Ranger(6): Knockdown<br>07: Ranger(7)<br>08: Ranger(8): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>09: Ranger(9): Improved Knockdown <br>10: Ranger(10): Favored Enemy: Dragons<br>11: Ranger(11)<br>12: Ranger(12): STR+1, Extend Spell, (STR=18)<br>13: Ranger(13)<br>14: Cleric(1): Domain: Travel, War<br>15: Cleric(2): Maximize Spell<br>16: Cleric(3): STR+1, (STR=19)<br>17: Cleric(4)<br>18: Cleric(5): Dodge<br>19: Cleric(6)<br>20: Cleric(7): WIS+1, (WIS=16)<br>21: Cleric(8): Mobility<br>22: SD(1)<br>23: Cleric(9)<br>24: Cleric(10): WIS+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Two-bladed Sword, (WIS=17)<br>25: Cleric(11)<br>26: Cleric(12)<br>27: Cleric(13): Epic Prowess<br>28: Cleric(14): WIS+1, (WIS=18)<br>29: Cleric(15)<br>30: Cleric(16): Improved Critical: Two-bladed Sword<br>31: Cleric(17)<br>32: Cleric(18): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br>33: Cleric(19): Great Strength, (STR=20)<br>34: Cleric(20)<br>35: Cleric(21)<br>36: Cleric(22): STR+1, Great Strength, (STR=22)<br>37: Cleric(23): Armor Skin, Great Wisdom, (WIS=20)<br>38: SD(2)<br>39: Cleric(24): Great Strength, (STR=23)<br>40: Ranger(14): STR+1, (STR=24)<br><br>Unbuffed, wielding mundane Two-bladed Sword:<br>HP: 428<br>AC: 22<br>AB Main: +37/+32/+27/+22<br>Critical: 17-20 / x2<br>Damage Main: 1-8 + 7<br><br>AB Offhand: +37/+32<br>Critical: 17-20 / x2<br>Damage Offhand: 1-8 + 3 <br><br>Fortitude: 24<br>Reflex: 17<br>Will: 24<br><br>Buffed, wielding mundane Two-bladed Sword:<br>HP: 558 <br>AC: 35<br>AB Main: +60/+55/+50/+45<br>Critical: 17-20 / x2<br>Damage Main: 1-8 + 13, +6 Slashing Damage, +7 Magical Damage <br><br>AB Offhand: +60/+55<br>Critical: 17-20 / x2<br>Damage Offhand: 1-8 + 6, +6 Slashing Damage, +7 Magical Damage <br><br>Fortitude: 31<br>Reflex: 25<br>Will: 32<br><br>Any constructive criticism is appreciated.

Ok, minimum +50 buffed AB, I'll assume it's a +6 weapon from the buffed stats (+6 slashing), which means you're actually just asking for +44 unbuffed AB, so I don't see the catch, it's a relatively normal AB for any meleer. I think I can get that much with a STR based Fighter 8 / Champion of Torm 10 / Dwarven Defender 22 and still grab EDR III to end with a adamage reduction of 24/-, which is nice.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Worth noting that WIS bonus spells aside, a level 24 cleric gets exactly as many spell slots as a level 40 cleric, or a level 20 cleric.  You won't have the bonus slots from WIS, but that's it, and that aint a huge deal.

Ok, I feel there's something missing. Forget the no XP penalty request I first stated. What about a Ranger/Cleric/Monk build. Or Ranger/Cleric/Rogue.. Monk would get evasion, 10% more speed and make WIS modifier to AC which will be a great bonus with Wisdom equipment. Max modifier of 10 if the current draft is equipped with +11 wisdom gear. Rogue would get evasion and 2d6 sneaks plus UMD.<br><br>I know cleric/monk kind of reeks, but I just can't help myself. Can even bump up to Monk6 for IKD, +1 AC and 20% extra speed.<br><br>Any thoughts?

With Monk, why not Fighter in place of Ranger?<br><br>I don't think I ever made a character with less than 21 ranger levels (aside from Zero <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  ), so I might not be your best bet.<br><br>But with 10 Dex and light armour won't your AC suffer badly?<br><br>Your starting stats would have to be shuffled up, I'm thinking STR  14 and DEX 14.

I'll take a look into it and see if I can make everything fit. <br><br>I also might be totally off, but ranger does really not seem like a good choice to me.<br><br>Even in your previous incarnations, I think fighter would trump ranger, skillpoints aside.

I've been thinking more along the lines of Fighter myself the last couple of days. Maybe it can work out, but I have yet to make a build draft. 15 dex is required for Ambidexterity, which means even less strength. And a fighter/cleric combination would be rough on the ability points considering wisdom, strength AND the 15 dex. Not to mention int for skill points and con for much needed hp. I wonder how it may turn out..

I've thought about similar dual weapon builds for the fun of it.  I think I came up with 10 ranger 28 cleric 2 monk.  With a 19 wis, if you can buff with spells and items to the +12 cap you will have a +9 wis modifier, which means your AC in robes will be 1 higher than your AC in full plate assuming you have no dex. In all likelihood, you should be able to get your dex up to around +6 or so with buffs, meaning you are getting around 6 more AC in robes than full plate. And lets face it, strength characters in robes look pretty cool.  If you decide you don't need 28 cleric levels you can also take more monk levels for the speed bonuses too.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DocRufio on 10/06/09 04:21</span></i></p>

See what you think of something like this.  Note you could drop 2 int for 15 starting dex to wind up at 16 if you wanted to go monk and unarmored (you'd get +7 AC from wis/dex, full plate + dex is +9, so you'd only need a little gear to get higher AC.  You lose UMD, though).  I whipped this together at 1 AM so please forgive any glaring errors I know I made, this isn't even really leveling optimized likely, just something that would at a minimum work...I think.<br><br>Cleric 26/Fighter 12/Monk or Rogue 2<br><br>Starting Stats<br>Str 14 (26)<br>Dex 14 (15)<br>Con 14<br>Int 14<br>Wis 14 (20)<br>Cha 8<br><br>BAB: 25<br>Mundane AB: 37<br>AB with full cleric buffs and +12 str: 63<br>Attack schedule dual-wielding and hasted: 61/56/51/61/56/63/56<br><br>1 Fighter (1)	 	Weapon Focus, Toughness<br>2 Cleric (1)<br>3 Cleric (2) 		Knockdown	<br>4 Cleric (3) 	Wis +1<br>5 Cleric (4)<br>6 Cleric (5) 		Blind Fight<br>7 Cleric (6)<br>8 Cleric (7)	Wis +2<br>9 Cleric (8) 		Extend Spell<br>10 Cleric (9)<br>11 Cleric (10)<br>12 Cleric (11) 	Wis +3	Improved Critical<br>13 Cleric (12)<br>14 Cleric (13)	<br>15 Cleric (14) 		Two Weapon Fighting<br>16 Fighter (2)	Dex +1	Ambidexterity<br>17 Fighter (3)<br>18 Cleric (15) 		Improved Two Weapon Fighting<br>19 Cleric (16)<br>20 Cleric (17) Wis +4<br>21 Fighter (4)		Great Str I, Epic Weapon Focus<br>22 Rogue/Monk (1)<br>23 Cleric (18)<br>24 Fighter (5)	Str +1	Great Str II<br>25 Cleric (19)<br>26 Cleric (20)<br>27 Fighter (6)		Great Str III, Weapon Specialization<br>28 Cleric (21)	Str +2<br>29 Fighter (7)<br>30 Fighter (8)		Great Str IV, Epic Weapon Specialization<br>31 Cleric (22)<br>32 Cleric (23)	Str +3	Great Wisdom I<br>33 Fighter (9)		Great Str V<br>34 Fighter (10)		Epic Prowess<br>35 Cleric (24)<br>36 Cleric (25)	Str +4	Great Str VI<br>37 Fighter (11)<br>38 Fighter (12)		Armor Skin<br>39 Rogue/Monk (2)	Great Str VII<br>40 Cleric (26)	Str +5	Great Wisdom II<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Magical Master on 10/06/09 06:06</span></i></p>
