The Silent Mage is a master of the arcane, a lord over, and more importantly of, death and a channeler of magical energies.  Having started life as a wizard among the illithid, and unended as a demi-lich, the Silent Mage has the wisdom and intellect of ages behind him.  He knows that only a fool baits the forces of good, and it is a greater fool who challenges the chaos of evil.  Thus, the Silent Mage remains quiet, ever silent, ever living.<br><br>Advantages<br>The Silent Mage utilises to the full, the innate bonuses of being an Illithid, and those of being a Lich.  Almost immune to conventional forms of damage, ie. elemental,  with huge resistance to physical harm and fairly high HP for an arcane caster, the Silent Mage is very difficult to harm extensively.  He has the added bonuses of evasion and adding his fair wisdom score to AC.  With his very high intelligence (50 unbuffed, mod of 20) his spells have an immense DC and he has many skill points to spare.  With regard to Epic Spells, the Silent Mage can capably and confidently fling around the nastiest of death spells (Momento Mori and Tolodine's Killing Wind), making him a lethal opponent.<br><br>Disadvantages<br>Has absolutely no hope in a melee situation... Unless you are willing to spend ages just using the Lich Touch as an attack.  Has poor saving throws, but there is little need for them as he is immune to dev. crit., spells lvl 9 and below and a +14 save against spells.  If the alignment of the character is shifted to evil/, he is going to suffer from paladin/anti-paladin/CoT/blackguard smites, so be careful of generosity to NPCs.<br><br>Statistics<br>Race: Illithid<br>Alignment: Lawful Neutral<br>Wizard 29/Lich 10/Monk 1<br>Spell School: Conjuration<br><br>Ability Scores<br>Initial- STR:10, DEX:16, CON:16, INT:26, WIS:16, CHA:16<br>Final- STR:10, DEX:16, CON:16, INT:50, WIS:26, CHA:26<br><br>AB (Unarmed) +18/+15+12<br>AC 32 (Naked, 37 with Phylactery)<br>HP 481<br>Spell Resistance 65!!

Another note about this build: I really like the new Lich class, and its versatility.  This means that the Silent Mage can be easily and efficiently modified to be powerful with the base class as a Cleric.  All that needs to be changed are- first of all, be a Yuan-ti, not an Illithid, since Yuan-ti have better Wisdom bonuses, instead of taking Maximise Spell and Greater Spell Focus Necromancy, switch those for Spell and Greater Spell Focus in Evocation.  Although not readily apparent, with a Cleric this is a formidable set of feats.  Continuing along, switch Epic Skill Focus: Spellcraft for Epic Spell Focus in Evocation.  Be a little more sparing with the skill allocations, set initial stats to STR-10, DEX-10 (8+2), CON-14, WIS-26 (18+8), INT-20 (12+8), CHA 16(10+6).  Most important however, is the choice of domains.  In this case, taking the Destruction domain is a must, as it grants Implosion at level 8 as well as 9, plus its an evocation.  As a second domain, Air is one that suits well the focus on evocation.  That should be about all for that one, let me know if there are any faults. Cheers! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

For one, you do not get Implosion at level 8 (just tested this, in case it was a benefit that wasn't listed in the manual).

It could just be a glitch in the download i got, but instead of getting Acid Fog, you gain Implosion.  Also, regarding the Magic domain, Stoneskin is a kind of superfluous spell for a lvl 10 demi-lich.  With DR of 30/+20 its almost impossible to get better protection.

Water domain gets ice storm too, at level 4 I believe, as well as drown. Death gets wail of the banshee. Fire domain gets some nice spells too, including fire storm at level 7.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Giantevilhead on 05/15/05 01:27</span></i></p>
