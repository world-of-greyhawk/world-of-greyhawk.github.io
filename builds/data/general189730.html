I was making a druid on a server I'm fairly familiar with and was wonder what to wear later on in life. I didn't quite know what merged and what didn't. Is there a definite list on this?<br><br>-DaMouse

Unfortunately Mouse, there isn't.  It all depends on the shifter script being run.  There are some out there now that merge all equipment to try and make shifters more playable.  Without knowing the script, it would be hard to tell without a lot of testing on the mod.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

1) Ask a DM if any scripts are implemented to change shifter merging.  This is rarely done, as it tends to unbalance the shifter.<br>2a) If none, check the following: <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=397983&amp;forum=42" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br>Print it out if you can't memorise the data; I have one at hand most times I play my shifter.<br>2b) If there are, still do 2a; but alter your printout with notes of same..

As an example of shifter scripting, we have altered it to include half-"human" forms (ie. a "werewolf") and the script merges all equipment into the form except whatever is currently held in the hands.<br>_________________<br>Ferret Fact you never knew: <a href="http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/9060/page0blogentry12711.jpg" target="_blank">Click Here</a>
