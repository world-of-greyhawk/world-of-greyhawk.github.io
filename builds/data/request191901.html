Someone in the Bioware NWN General forum was dissappointed earlier when they learned that Circle Kick isn't bugged, but is designed to work as it does.  <br><br><a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=426146&amp;forum=42" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br>Circle Kick will allow, if you land an unarmed attack on one enemy, a free unarmed attack on a second enemy.  The problem is that your focus then switches to the new enemy.  You end up attacking more, but spreading the damage around so that the enemies last longer allowing them to damage you more.<br><br>My question is: Can anyone develop a build where Circle Kick is a help instead of a hinderance?

Yeah, I was thinking that too, but even with WM levels, you won't crit all that often with an unarmed attack...I have a feeling that circle will still be more of a disadvantage than an advantage.<br><br>Steve

One of my thoughts was the Dev Crit route in the hope of killing opponents before they kill you.  My other trail of thought led to a Epic Dodge and Self Concealment so that they just can't hit you.  Does anyone know if you can get Sneak damage on the Circle Kick?
