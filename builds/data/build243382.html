It is so long between Discipline drops, why bother?  Plus, he can jack his AC pretty damn high, and I felt Spellcraft and Tumble were more valuable than anything that Discipline brought to the table.  If PvP, I would consider cannabilzing Spellcraft (and the other utility skills) to get Discipline maxed to combat Called Shots and Disarms.<br><br><b>Domains</b>:  War is definitely a must.  Charisma synergizes well with it, as Battle Mastery is based in duration on your Charisma.  I felt Magic was a good runner-up because it offers both Stoneskin and Icestorm.  At 35 levels of Cleric, he can wreak havoc on the mobs with Icestorms and save his other powers for bosses and quasi-bosses.  But Trickery works well by adding more defense with Improved Invisibility.<br><br><b>Alignment Shift</b>:  There’s just one, and there are 18 levels to make the adjustment.  One of the easiest ones to make, too.  Can probably even be accomplished in the RP- bereft OCs.  I envision an inquisitor, a zealot of sorts.  In his pursuit of the monster, he has become the very thing he sought.<br><br><b>Charisma</b>:  One has to ask, why not just go Strength and Wisdom, or just Wisdom?  I wanted to abuse the Paladin/Blackguard exploit, so in pumping charisma, I essentially am doubling my save bonuses.  It also synergizes with Divine Might and Divine Shield, Turn Undead, is used for spell durations on several spells (Battle Mastery), also gives advantages in Taunt skill, and fulfills the role play image of the Zealot Inquistor who, in spite of his twisted logic, is able to win over the the masses to his will (think of Mr. Talkinghorn from Dicken’s <i>Bleak House</i>)<br><br><b>Saves:</b> Yes, they’re disgustingly good.  If Autofail 1 is disabled, someone is going to have to whip up some pretty nasty mojo for you to fail.  You should never ever fail a Fort or Will save (1s excepting of course).<br><br><br><i>Fixed buffed AB - Kail Pendragon</i><br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/14/07 13:49</span></i></p>

IMO the main advantage would be that your max buffed AB would be two points higher, which, in itself is <i>not</i> worth the loss of spell slots. This is mainly because this build is obviously best suited for low magic, and his buffed AB is good enough for that. In high magic, however, his AB is too low. And no, the +2 from the STR will not be enough to make it worthwhile.<br><br>2. Extend Spell. With 35 casters levels the durations should be long enough -- I'd maybe replace it with Maximize. With the Rakshasa builds I grew to love Maximized Ice Storms and, for this build, one would dish out 100 damage (I figure, my math might fail me at this latest of hours). [3 * 6 +(2 + 35 / 3) * 6] for the damage I'd recall using that formula with the Raks builds, heh <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>BTW, I wonder why you list your buffed AB at 62 while your max is, by all logic, at 31 +20 +6 = 57?<br>_________________<br>"...<br>C'est un pays plus nu que la terre polaire<br>— Ni bêtes, ni ruisseaux, ni verdure, ni bois!<br><br>Or il n'est pas d'horreur au monde qui surpasse<br>La froide cruauté de ce soleil de glace<br>Et cette immense nuit semblable au vieux Chaos;<br>..."<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 06/09/06 23:14</span></i></p>

Nietzsche is also attributed with saying that a casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything; however, it would appear that he was wrong, as would seem from your build. As the son of a Lutheran pastor, he should have known better; truly, is religion the opiate of the masses? as was postulated by Marx (writing originally about Germany, or rather, wrote did his student, but which the Germans had the good sense to ignore either way). Well, your build speaks to this, too. Well done, and love the use of quotes . . . such a nice touch. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Cheers!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Robert Tyr on 06/09/06 23:45</span></i></p>

Shame on you. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">    Oh, divine power eats off your +20 CAP allright.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Thanks for rubbing it in.  I've played NWN for 3 years and never so much as looked at a cleric unless I was sliding him off the end of my blade.<br>I always thought they were cheesy.  Now that I'm in the twilight of the NWN Universe, I've decided to open up a whole case of cheese, and what better way than with a Cleric with Pally and BG levels tossed in?<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Well, Grizz, I'm with you on that, but we've yet to plumb the depths of the PRC if you want to go into the dairy business...

Anyone using a Dickens' character, especially one from Bleak House, as a reference gets 1,000 style points from me.  I like the build, but probably would not play it myself, as I tend to play on higher magic worlds.  I would also keep the wisdom instead of putting the other 4 points into strength; imo more spell slots is better on this guy.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

Nice build.  I did a paladin/blackguard too, and I have to say they can be pretty scary.<br><br>You've got some nice no-save spells to handle the offensive slack in higher magic environments or when your buffed AB doesn't cut it... but I'd actually recommend plant domain for creeping doom (and to a lesser degree, barkskin) instead of war - war's domain power is great but it's once per day.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
