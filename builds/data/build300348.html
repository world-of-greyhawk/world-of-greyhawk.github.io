Lower your starting STR to 18, which gives you 6 points to spend. Put 4 of those on CON and 2 on INT. Then replace 4 of the Epic Toughness feats with Great STR. You wind up with the same health, and 2 more STR, and more skill points.<br>_________________<br>Great Research Tools:<br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWNWiki</a><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">NWN Epic Character Build Search Engine</a><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/" target="_blank">The NWN Vault</a>

He can only replace two of the Epic Toughness feats with GRT STR, as there are only two taken as general epic feats, if I read the build correctly. Unless he can take Armor Skin, Epic Weapon Focus, or Epic Prowess as Monk bonus feats (I don't know what's on the Monk epic bonus feat list off-hand). Then he could shuffle a couple of those feats around to make room for more GRT STR.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Nothing wrong with a strong half orc monk. But I don't see a monk as barroom brawler, lawful and dedicated to ki and discipline. And I don't understand how one becomes a monk with a mental retardation like int 6. But that's just my view on RP.<br><br>The build itself: With an intelligence of 6, you only get two skills to focus on. You don't tell us what skills.<br><br>I agree with taking less strength from the start for better con (and int if you want more skills than just discipline and tumble.)<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 08/20/08 12:08</span></i></p>

Monk epic bonus feats: armor skin, blinding speed, epic damage reduction, epic energy resistance, epic toughness, improved ki strike 4, improved ki strike 5, improved spell resistance, improved stunning fist, self concealment <br><br>AS can be moved on a monkish bonus feat slot and EER is worth more than Epic Toughness as is ISR. I personally don't see the point of all those epic toughnesses in the first place, especially when you could start with 18 STR and 14 CON (and 8 INT), get AS as a monk bonus feat instead of one epic toughness, change 2 more epic toughness to Great STR to recover the points "lost" with the new starting stats.  You can still change 1 epic toughness to something else (ISR or EER) and keep the same HPs (480) or change the last 2 epic toughness too to EER or ISR as I said and keep a respectable 440 HPs. ET feats are basically not worth a feat slot.<br><br>Iron Will 2 lvls before mind immunity makes little sense either.<br><br>Also, you are missing skillpoints total and skills assignment there. The format in general is not very nice either, but some leeway is given to pure class builds... it's not like you can mess up when to take which class after all <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 08/20/08 12:20</span></i></p>

I thought about roleplaying that the orc was just really good at bashing stuff with his hands and also so dumb that spells didn't work on him too well.  It would be like the orc was channeling ki without even knowing why or how or that he was at all, and that would also explain why I avoided monk specific feats.<br><br>I should point out that all of the skill points went to tumble and discipline, and since the orc got 2 per level that would leave none left at level 40.  I figured that those two skills were a given for any melee type.<br><br>I intentionally avoided the Devastating Critical path for two reasons: first, I'm not sure that it works on the server I play on; and second, a threat range of 1 (19-20) doesn't seem worth it for Devastating Critical.

The recomended build too goes for ET 6. That alone says a lot <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

roflmao!  Thanks for that!  Yeah, the OT isnt a recommended build!  I didnt mean it that way.  The NWN choices are some of the most assinine i have ever seen, and, like a many of the players here, it seems NWN HATES dev crit aswell!   There was only one time that i can recall where the nwn program chose the same feats I wanted to take.  It was a PRC build, where i took Dev crit at lv 21 (Using a half orc Brawler/bard/rdd thing) and for the last 10 feats, i wanted Gr str1-10 and so did the NWN program!! WOO HOO!  <br><br>I apologize if i sounded alittle harsh above.  My only intention was to inspire a one class build to aspire to more than takin Epic Toughness... i mean, those are the feats you have to take when you are doing a 15+ lv weapon master strength build and you have no other options!  I truly like the ISR idea.  It makes this monk alittle more sexy, if it is possible with a 6 charisma. Infact, I like it soo much that i would take 6 gr strs (only ewf on other) and take the 4 monk feats as ISR.  <br><br>CHEERS   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 11/27/07 23:01 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I agree with avado, Storm of Vengeance rocks, it stuns great, it can deal heavy damage over time, and Evasion doesn't work against it, you should try it in your strategy as well, too bad it's conjura</div></blockquote>
