Hey all, been while.<br><br>I finally figured it was time for me to try a rogue... I don't think I have done one or really looked at it. This time around, I went heavy instead of few levels of rogue and wanted to see what I can do with it.<br><br>Anyway, this is not official build, just merely an experiment. I would like to have some feedback on this.<br><br>Rogue(32), Shadowdancer(2), Fighter(6), Human<br><br>STR: 18 (28)<br>DEX: 15<br>CON: 10<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 12<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Human: (Quick to Master)<br>01: Rogue(1): Blind Fight, Dodge<br>02: Rogue(2): {Evasion}<br>03: Rogue(3): Mobility, {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>04: Rogue(4): STR+1, (STR=19)<br>05: Rogue(5)<br>06: Rogue(6): Ambidexterity<br>07: Rogue(7)<br>08: Shadowdancer(1): STR+1, {Hide in Plain Sight}, (STR=20)<br>09: Shadowdancer(2): Power Attack, {Darkvision}<br>10: Rogue(8)<br>11: Rogue(9)<br>12: Rogue(10): STR+1, Cleave, Crippling Strike, (STR=21)<br>13: Fighter(1): Great Cleave<br>14: Fighter(2): Improved Critical: Rapier<br>15: Fighter(3): Weapon Focus: Rapier<br>16: Fighter(4): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Rapier, (STR=22)<br>17: Fighter(5)<br>18: Fighter(6): Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>19: Rogue(11)<br>20: Rogue(12): STR+1, (STR=23)<br>21: Rogue(13): Overwhelming Critical: Rapier, Improved Evasion<br>22: Rogue(14)<br>23: Rogue(15)<br>24: Rogue(16): STR+1, Improved Sneak Attack I, Improved Sneak Attack II, (STR=24)<br>25: Rogue(17)<br>26: Rogue(18)<br>27: Rogue(19): Improved Sneak Attack III, Improved Sneak Attack IV<br>28: Rogue(20): STR+1, (STR=25)<br>29: Rogue(21)<br>30: Rogue(22): Devastating Critical: Rapier<br>31: Rogue(23)<br>32: Rogue(24): STR+1, Improved Sneak Attack V, (STR=26)<br>33: Rogue(25): Improved Sneak Attack VI<br>34: Rogue(26)<br>35: Rogue(27)<br>36: Rogue(28): STR+1, Improved Sneak Attack VII, Improved Sneak Attack VIII, (STR=27)<br>37: Rogue(29)<br>38: Rogue(30)<br>39: Rogue(31): Improved Sneak Attack IX<br>40: Rogue(32): STR+1, Improved Sneak Attack X, (STR=28)<br><br>Hitpoints: 268<br>Skillpoints: 390<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 19/15/25<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4, Traps: +5<br>BAB: 26<br>AB (max, naked): 36 (melee), 28 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 20/30<br><br>Disable Trap 30(31), Hide 43(45), Listen 43(42), Lore 26(27), Move Silently 43(45), Open Lock 30(32), Search 9(10), Spellcraft 20(21), Spot 43(42), Tumble 40(42), UMD 43(42)<br><br><b>NOTES</b><br>I know that it's not well liked that the attributes ends at odd digit instead of even. But, I believe that's acceptable, at least for me. The reason is that I needed just enough to meet the requirement of Ambidexterity and have enough left for intelligence for a better skillset.<br><br>As for the number of level per classes, the reason behind this is to get most out of the number of attacks you can do. If you only took one level of SD and took one in Rogue, you would end up with 3 instead of 4. And yes, you could technically take another fighter to get 4, but there's no point of seventh fighter in my opinion.<br><br>Anyway, I tested this concept just for a bit. It seems that while doing sneak attacks, it's averaging around 110 or so per SA.<br><br>The advantages of this concept is that it has HiPS at earliest as possible while it also has pretty high SA in addition to devastating critical in its arsenal.<br><br>Ah, almost forgot one thing... The reason that all of epic is taken as rogue is that I wanted to get all ISA I-X while taking DC and Improved Evasion (unless a better alternative is suggested?).<br><br>There is few things that is disadvantage about this is that it has pretty crappy saves and low HP which can be solved if you can get hands on scrolls.<br><br>In addition to choice of weapon, you could switch from rapiers to scimitars. Should not make any difference. In my case, I went scimitar instead of rapier.<br><br><b>/NOTES</b><br><br>That's all for now...

This is not multiplied in the case of a crit and does not apply to sneak or critical immune foes.  If you add EWF/EWS, you lose 7 average sneak attack damage.  You gain 2 AB and 4 constant damage.  In other words, against a foe you can sneak attack, you're trading 3 damage per sneak attack for 2 extra AB and if you crit then you'll actually do 1 more damage with EWS than with 2 more improved sneak attacks.  Against a sneak immune/crit immune foe, you're losing nothing and gaining 2 AB and 4 damage.

The AB loss for using a non preferred wpn is ok since many foes are flatfooted etc.<br><br>This is also why i like to include KD/IKD to deal with any casters, especially if they are wielding a small wpn.<br><br>The other change for me would be drop the extra sneak attacks, and stop at rogue 25ish, pumping more Ftr. If that amount of sneak doesnt do it for you with 2 weapons then usually i revert to other tactic. Ooooops. Different build now <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    i recall Grizz posted a dwarf rog/ftr like this.<br><br>&lt;edit&gt; ps.. i am in awe that you are gracing this forum again.. long live nwn.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>The reason that I have STR that high at start is to get Dev Crit early as possible with Human as race and due to high Rogue layout and also to end as 28 STR.<br><br>Why? The reason is this.. if you are able to work in group and have decent amount of STR boost from items and whatnot.. and in conjunction with other casters that boost strength. You can get 40 STR as compared to 38.<br><br>I would have prefered to end with 30 but since I didn't take two extra fighter level in epic... But if that's what you want, you can alter that and only lose 1 ISA and 1 1d6 from Rogue levels. If you did that, you can end with 42 STR while boosted by items and spells.<br><br>By stopping rogue once reaching 25 in that class, you are losing out on quite an amount of damage from SA. 25 only has 13d6 as compared to 31 level which has 16d6. Also, you lose lots of ISA from this change since assuming that you take all epic except first two as rogue, you delay the ISA much later. You lose 2 ISA... you also delay Improved Evasion and Crippling Strike.<br><br>So.. I did a little math, the amount of damage at max is... 78(25) + 36(ISA) which is 114 dmg and 96(31) + 48(ISA) which is 144, that's 30 damage difference. I am too lazy at the moment to do the rest of the math concerning the attacks while hasted, etc. But I figure that is large number of dmg loss from SA.<br><br>I didn't do the KD and IKD because this build is tight with feats and it needs most of the listed feats. But if you can afford to lose more ISA, I would suggest two more level of fighter after level 8 to net those feats with right adjustments. But I wouldn't recommend it. Also the other reason is that IKD requires 13 intelligence which this does not have. It can get KD however.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 10/09/09 13:03 (GMT) -- WhiZard<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 10/09/09 05:39 (GMT) -- jumjones<br><br>I would go for mace as the weapon for Bludgeon dmg.<br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Morningstar or Warhammer does better with a strength build.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I believe that the Morningstar cannot be equipped by off-hand.

Morningstar cannot go in the offhand, no.  Warhammer would suffer the size penalty of -4 compared to -2.

Do you <i>really</i> want Dev Crit?  Seems to me you could make better use of the feats. ISA X w/ Dev Crit reeks of putting all your eggs in one basket.  I'd take EWF, EWS, KD, IKD, and something else and drop dev crit for redundancy. If they're sneakable, they're goin' down.  It might take the whole round instead of the first hit, but you can set them up for sneaks better, hit more often, do a bit more damage, and be in better shape against those crit/sneak immunes.

I'm just sayin', w/ that sweet SA, you could take down groups very quickly anyways (especially those low HP mages...).  Drop a darkness on their butts and you're golden.  I'm not saying Dev Crit is totally useless or anything, but I do think it's entirely too much of an advantage to make what is already a strength (and a significant one), yet more deadly.
