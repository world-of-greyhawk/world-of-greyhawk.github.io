There, I've made some important changes to this build, as suggested by those who posted on the old topic.  I'm posting this new topic so newcomers will not have to wade through the discussion to get the full benefits the build offers.<br><br>Usually, such builds involve a level of Monk to increase AC, but as I've included Bard in the mix, that may not be possible for some players.  This build, therefore, focuses on spellcasting, buffing, and archery.  It excels at all three, though damage from the arrows is a bit low.<br><br>Elf, any non-lawful<br><br>Starting abilities:<br>STR 8<br>DEX 10<br>CON 12<br>INT 10<br>WIS 18<br>CHA 14<br><br>Leveling:<br>1 - Bard 1 --- <b>Point Blank Shot</b><br>2 - Cleric 1 --- War Domain, Plant Domain<br>3 - Cleric 2 --- <b>Spell Focus (evocation)</b><br>4 - Bard 2 (WIS 19)<br>5 - Cleric 3<br>6 - Bard 3 --- <b>Zen Archery</b><br>7 - Cleric 4<br>8 - Bard 4 (WIS 20)<br>9 - Cleric 5 --- <b>Weapon Focus (longbow)</b><br>10 - Bard 5<br>11 - Bard 6<br>12 - Bard 7 (WIS 21) --- <b>Curse Song</b><br>13 - Arcane Archer 1<br>14 - Arcane Archer 2<br>15 - Arcane Archer 3 --- <b>Greater Spell Focus (evocation)</b><br>16 - Arcane Archer 4 (WIS 22)<br>17 - Arcane Archer 5<br>18 - Arcane Archer 6 --- <b>Maximize Spell</b><br>19 - Arcane Archer 7<br>20 - Arcane Archer 8 (WIS 23)<br>21 - Cleric 6 --- <b>Great Wisdom I</b> (24)<br>22 - Cleric 7<br>23 - Cleric 8<br>24 - Bard 8 (WIS 25) --- <b>Great Wisdom II</b> (26)<br>25 - Cleric 9<br>26 - Bard 9<br>27 - Cleric 10 --- <b>Great Wisdom III</b> (27)<br>28 - Bard 10 (WIS 28)<br>29 - Cleric 11<br>30 - Bard 11 --- <b>Great Wisdom IV</b> (29)<br>31 - Cleric 12<br>32 - Cleric 13 (WIS 30)<br>33 - Cleric 14 --- <b>Great Wisdom V</b> (31)<br>34 - Cleric 15<br>35 - Cleric 16<br>36 - Cleric 17 (WIS 32) --- <b>Epic Spell Focus (evocation)</b><br>37 - Cleric 18<br>38 - Cleric 19<br>39 - Cleric 20 --- <b>Great Wisdom VI</b> (33)<br>40 - Bard 12 (WIS 34)<br><br>There will still be XP penalties, at levels 12-20 and from 32 on.<br><br>Ending abilities:<br>STR 8 (18 w/Divine Power)<br>DEX 10<br>CON 12<br>INT 10<br>WIS 34<br>CHA 14<br><br>Skill point total: <b>132</b><br>ONLY raise skills when taking Bard levels.

Probably a bug due to taking three classes pre-epic.<br>- More levels with an experience penalty.<br>- No Call Lightning or Chain Lightning.<br><br><br>Overall, this was a dramatic improvement, at least in theory.  I've yet to play this build.  I might tweak the level progression and see if I can get the BAB to end up at 17 instead of 16.  Implosion DC wasn't hurt, AB went down by only one, AC and HP and Fort save went waaaay up, and bow damage went up too!  All that at very little cost.  Thanks to all who contributed to refining this build!!<br><br>I realize one level of Monk is a better choice for AC reasons, but I prefer archery and <b>this build works on servers that don't allow characters to become more lawful.</b><br><br>Note that I did NOT take Aura of Vitality into account; this is partly because I built the character fully in a leveler, then switched my domains and didn't want to relevel the whole thing just for one spell.  It is also partly because I wasn't sure if the STR/CON/DEX bonuses would stack with my other buffs - if not, a +5 bonus from maxed ability buffs would trump +4 from Aura.<br><br>Lastly, feel free to take other domains.  War allows you to max Cat's Grace for more AC, and Plant grants Barkskin, but the Magic domain could be taken over War for maxed Ice Storms; level 8 Cleric spells don't contain many good attack spells, with the exception of Fire Storm which won't do squat to fire-based enemies.<br><br>Any further comments?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By johann_howitzer on 02/14/07 01:52</span></i></p>

Why elf?   In this case (and it may well be the only real example in the history of nwn builds) Half-elf makes more sense!  You are making a zen archer so you dont need the dex!  Half elf gives you access to AA without the penalty to xp.   There are still more things to twink to this build, but that is all i will report as I have not seen the first version.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

The ONLY benefit Half-elf gives is favored class: any.  Elf, on the other hand, gets FULL (rather than partial) skill affinities for Search, Listen, and Spot, plus Keen Senses.  An experience penalty has no effect on the final build's quality, only the time it takes to get there, so I'd go with Elf here.  Besides, I'm one of those weird people who has such fun playing a character that I like it to take a bit longer to level, and I'd take the Elven affinities and Keen Senses over the favored class.  Not to mention an extra 2 in DEX adds 1 to AC (or in this case, avoids a penalty) and DEX-related skills, like Tumble.  Not that a Half-elf couldn't put two points in DEX anyway...<br><br>This question of race is just one of those things that's up to the player's taste.<br><br><br>EDIT: I miscalculated something in the first post... the AC with a nonmagical Full Plate and all buffs should be 49, not 51.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By johann_howitzer on 02/14/07 06:25</span></i></p>

OK, I tried Half-elf with this build and discovered a fatal flaw: Half-elves do NOT get proficiency with the Longbow, while Elves do.  That means I'd have to take Martial Proficiency not only pre-epic, but also before Weapon Focus Longbow, which is a prerequisite for Arcane Archer.  None of the pre-epic feats I've listed are ones that could be sacrificed just for the sake of avoiding an XP penalty!<br><br>Half-elf is therefore NOT a viable option for this build, I'm sorry to say.

This may sound stupid and all, but why not just go Cleric20/Bard20?  I really don't see what AA is bringing to the table to this build other than to slow it down. Using this new model, you'll have a full plethora of spells, no xp penalty, same feats as before, and have a better Bard song/Curse Song.  That alone makes up for any so-called AB loss you would have from dropping AA.  Further, at most you would have is a +4 enhancement on your arrows.  That's not exactly stellar, even in mid-magic worlds.  Go Cleric20/Bard20, or Cleric26/Bard14(for undispellable Cleric Buffs and 2 bonus feats), or Cleric20/Bard18/BG2 (gets a nice save boost, and still avoids xp penalty).<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 02/15/07 02:58</span></i></p>

If you do decide to go with the cleric/ bard split and forego the AA route entirely, then of course you could always go human, or A N Other.

Arcane Archer does indeed bring something to this build.  Without it, the build is incapable of doing damage except through spellcasting, which although potent is not unlimited.  When you run out of spells, you run out of power until the next rest.<br><br>The Bard spells at levels 5 and 6 really don't bring much to the table.  All you really have is a bunch of stuff that Cleric can do anyway, plus Dirge and Ethereal Visage, which aren't all that great.  At Bard level 12, you already have the best possible buff to AB anyway.<br><br>As for taking some epic levels in Cleric, I see no real benefit other than maybe 1 more to Implosion DC.  Undispellable buffs have been mentioned, but... why worry about that?  You'll never have to worry about being dispelled since AB is high enough to hit anyway, and you'll be in the back of the party; it's not like being a Wizard or Sorcerer where being dispelled means extreme vulnerability - Cleric buffs are mainly AB-oriented.

Having the 26 cleirc lvls (yes, 25, but 26 gives you the bonus feat) would change the build too much in this build to even consider it.  It seems that there is a misconception that spell DC has something to do with character lvls..  it does not, iirc.  Spell dc is 10 + modifier + foci+ spell lvl (not caster lv).  <br><br>To say that you never have to worry bout dispells cuz you hit!!

A mage in greater sanctuary casting dispel on me?  Bah, it wouldn't do much.  The dispel would kill his sanctuary, and I'd be able to hit with my bow (mages typically have horribly low AC, remember).  That's the least of my worries, especially considering most of my buffs are low-level spells I could just recast quickly.<br><br>Thanks for the compliment!  It is a sound build, and a very fun one at that.  It's not an uber build by any means, but it can do a lot of useful things, and you have to admit it's getting so there aren't many more builds to be made on this forum.  The fact that I found something previously unattempted is pretty cool, in my opinion!

The +4 to arrows gained through AA stacks with whatever arrows you have equipped, unless I'm horribly mistaken (which is very possible), so it's still a big help.  I admit, 4 more levels of Bardsong does grant +3 more to Dodge AC, but the reason I capped Bard at 12 is because you get +2 to Dodge AC and the max AB increase, which is +2.  In hindsight, I guess +3 AC is a bit better than the benefits of AA 8.  Maybe Cleric 20 / Bard 16 / Fighter 4 would be a better option, as you suggest.

If you have +2 arrows, you can't add +4 to it to make them +6, nor will it override the +2.  AAs work best with just plain arrows and arrows with elemental damage types only, as they can still have an attack enchantment placed on it.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

One last point... taking Cleric 19 / Bard 12 / AA 9 increases enchant arrow by 1, while only losing one level 9 spell slot and a casterlevel.  Considering the enchanted arrows help with bypassing damage resistance (unless I'm very mistaken!), AA 9 would seem to be the better option.  Unless you really feel you need the one extra Implosion.
