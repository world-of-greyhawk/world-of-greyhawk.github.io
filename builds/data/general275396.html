What's the earliest possible one can get self concealement? Every build I've tried I have to be level 30 in order to start taking the feat..and by that time I dont have enough feats to get all 5 of them before level 40. Thanks for the help and tips in advance.

You can get it at level 28 as a rogue10/assassin18, but you'll get the last feat at level 36.<br>A pure rogue can do the same.

What build are you trying to get self-concealment on?  Pretty much anything with 20 DEX at the start, and around 10 rogue levels by level 28 will get it for you, if you choose Self Concealment as your bonus feats (for rogue 10/13/16/19).

I can't recall if it's the earliest, but it's pretty damned close.  One of my all-time favorite builds: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "226113", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Harper Negotiator</a>  He has SC III by Level 30.  You can readjust those Fighter levels in Epic and have SC V by Level 34.  I think that's pretty darn quick, and might be as quick as it gets.  And of course, Epic Dodge by Level 21. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
