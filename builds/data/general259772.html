I was hoping to clear up a few game mechanic questions. So here it goes...<br><br>The Dev. Crit formula (at least according to NWNwiki)is 10 + 1/2 character level + Strength Modifier<br><br>My first question: Does the 150% strength modifier for 2-Handed Weapons apply to the Dev. Crit. DC?<br><br>OK the next question is what is the highest Strength you can achieve both with and without items? A Half-Orc can start with a 20 Strength, get +8 from going RDD, put 10 points into Strength from ability point adds and can take up the Great Strength feat 10 times right? So this would give you a Strength of 48 before items. I haven't seen any builds with a 48 Strength so I'm guessing abilities have a natural cap?<br><br>Also I've read that here is an ability cap from items of +12. Is that +12 cumulative for all abilities or +12 to each ability?<br><br>Finally what is the absolute highet Dev. Crit DC obtainable? The highest Strength bonus listed on NWNwiki is +20. So that would put it at 10 + 20 + 20 = 50DC. If using a 2-Handed weapon gives it an extra boost it would be 10 + 20 + 30 = 60DC?
