Ahh looks much more sturdy. You may want to play a bit with epic shadowlord. It won't be very durable being only level 19 sd, but your call. Summons can sometimes be all you need for a quick sneak attack with a target distracted.

I disagree that assassin serves you better than blackguard.  Blackguard gives you full bab progression, allowing you to get &gt;16bab pre epic, gives you sneak attack which is generally far more useful than death attack which can pretty much only be used once against one guy during a fight, sneak attack can be used again and again with your summon distracting.<br><br>A monk 8/blackguard 13/SD 19 would allow you to get SC 5, give you better hp, better ab and an additional summon to use when your shadowlord dies (btw neither shadowlord or fiend is really worth taking epic feats for since they don't receive a substantial improvement).<br><br>For lvling order 8 Monk -&gt; 4 SD -&gt;8 Blackguard, then whatever you want epic.  Try take one of each BG and SD near 40 to max discipline/hide/move silently/Tumble/UMD.

I thought Death Attack worked just like Sneak Attack, with the addition of a chance to paralyze.  If so, I get about +3d6 damage per Sneak if I took Assassin.  This character also wouldn't use many of the best features of the Blackguard class.<br><br>But Blackguard would give an additional attack.  Then again, with Haste, the character's already at 8 attacks per round.  Blackguard would give more hit points too.  Hrmmm.

The biggest controlling factor is how you plan on playing the character.

Which means your initial shot (if you win initiative) is the only one that hits.  Which means if there is a single creature there you do a bit extra damage and have a chance to paralyze them(great DEATH attack huh?).  Which makes it useless most of the time.  BG gives better ab, a real sneak attack, another summon and better hp.  Just my 2 cents.

What if I went Rogue instead of Assassin?  Would I suffer heinous XP penalties?<br><br>The way I envision the character is to appear in the middle of a mob, lay waste to all about, and then fade away when all or dead or the character is in trouble.  Blackguard may be better for that.

Ok, here we go.  Final version of this character.  I'll post it in the other thread, as well as a new thread if the moderators want me to.<br><br>Same Stats.<br><br>Level Allocation:<br>Monk x 7<br>Shadowdancer x 3<br>Blackguard x 5<br>Shadowdancer x 10<br>Blackguard x 7<br>Shadowdancer x 1<br>Blackguard x 1<br>Shadowdancer x 5<br>Monk x 1<br><br>Feats:<br>Level 1: Dodge, Mobility<br>Level 3: Weapon Finesse<br>Level 6: Ambidexterity<br>Level 9: Two Weapon Fighting<br>Level 12: Improved Two Weapon Fighting<br>Level 15: Weapon Focus: Kama<br>Level 18: Toughness<br>Level 21: Great Dexterity I<br>Level 24: Great Dexterity II<br>Level 25: Epic Dodge<br>Level 27: Great Dexterity III<br>Level 30: Great Dexterity IV<br>Level 33: Self Concealment I<br>Level 34: Epic Weapon Focus: Kama<br>Level 36: Self Concealment II &amp; III<br>Level 39: Self Concealment IV &amp; V<br><br>The only other minor change I might make would be to take 2 points from each INT and WIS and put them into CHR, to make 12.  But that might not be worth it.
