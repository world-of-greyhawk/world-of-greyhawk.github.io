I was toying around with a high AB sneaker with ED/SCV. The Stealthy Blade of Doom is the result.<br><br>A mean halfling with AB 48, naked AC 32 (34 with medium shield), ED, SCV, good critical range (30%), maxed UMD , 10d6 sneak attack, able to set deadly traps. Think of sneaking among your enemy ranks, maybe already covered in darkness/ultravision and unleash your IWWA at 48 AB, 15-20 crit range, x3 crit <b>and</b> 10d6 sneaks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  <br><br>The drawbacks are low HP (a problem before you get really difficult to hit), poor saves (get some mind immunity item), low damage against sneak/crit immunes (you wanna get some STR gear) and feat starvation, at least preepic. I would have loved to get cripplig strike (one could drop one SC for it), called shot and the KD feats. I don't know, maybe drop IC and blind fight for KD/IKD or drop IWWA for KD at least. Without KD you are left with flanking, stealth and darkness/ultravision (my favourite) to generate sneaks.<br>Before you ask, yes, one could go elf... but why? You'd lose 1 point from AB, AC, saves just to get some size back, basically. IMO it's not worth it.<br><br>Off with the build:<br><br><b>Stealthy Blade of Doom</b><br>Rogue(19), Weapon Master(19), Fighter(2)<br>Halfling, any alignment<br><i>PvM, playable 1-40, untested PvP</i><br><br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 20 (32)<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 364<br>Skillpoints: 304<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 20/15/35 (+4 vs spells)<br>BAB: 28<br>AB: 48 (melee), 42 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/shield): 32/34<br>Sneak Attack: 10d6<br><br>Disable Trap 22(26), Discipline 43(43), Hide 42(53), Intimidate 4(3), Move Silently 42(55), Set Trap 24(37), Spellcraft 18(20), Tumble 40(51), UMD 41(40), 10 points leftover<br><br><br>01: Rogue(1): Dodge<br>02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus<br>03: Fighter(2): Expertise, Mobility<br>04: Rogue(2): DEX+1, Ro: (Evasion), (DEX=21)<br>05: Rogue(3): Ro: (Uncanny Dodge I)<br>06: Rogue(4): Spring Attack<br>07: Rogue(5)<br>08: Rogue(6): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>09: Rogue(7): Whirlwind Attack<br>10: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice<br>11: Weapon Master(2)<br>12: Weapon Master(3): DEX+1, Weapon Finesse, (DEX=23)<br>13: Weapon Master(4)<br>14: Weapon Master(5)<br>15: Weapon Master(6): Improved Critical%<br>16: Weapon Master(7): DEX+1, (DEX=24)<br>17: Weapon Master(8)<br>18: Rogue(8): Blind Fight%<br>19: Weapon Master(9)<br>20: Weapon Master(10): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br>21: Rogue(9): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=26)<br>22: Rogue(10): Improved Evasion<br>23: Rogue(11)<br>24: Rogue(12): DEX+1, Great Dexterity II, (DEX=28)<br>25: Rogue(13): Defensive Roll<br>26: Weapon Master(11)<br>27: Weapon Master(12): Epic Dodge<br>28: Weapon Master(13): DEX+1, Epic Weapon Focus, (DEX=29)<br>29: Rogue(14)<br>30: Weapon Master(14) Improved Whirlwind Attack*<br>31: Weapon Master(15)<br>32: Weapon Master(16): DEX+1, Armor Skin, (DEX=30)<br>33: Rogue(15): Self Concealment I<br>34: Rogue(16): Self Concealment II<br>35: Weapon Master(17)<br>36: Weapon Master(18): DEX+1, Self Concealment III, (DEX=31)<br>37: Rogue(17)<br>38: Rogue(18)<br>39: Rogue(19): Self Concealment IV, Self Concealment V<br>40: Weapon Master(19): DEX+1, Epic Prowess, (DEX=32)<br><br>*optional feat<br>%might want to get KD/IKD instead<br><br><br><b>Skills by level</b><br>01: Disable Trap(4), Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Set Trap(4), Tumble(4), Save(20), <br>02: Discipline(5), <br>03: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(3), <br>04: Disable Trap(2), Hide(3), Move Silently(3), Set Trap(3), Tumble(3), UMD(6), <br>05: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), Tumble(1), Save(6), <br>06: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(1), Save(7), <br>07: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(1), Save(7), <br>08: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(3), Tumble(1), UMD(5), <br>09: Disable Trap(5), Hide(1), Intimidate(4), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), Tumble(1), <br>10: Discipline(7), <br>11: Discipline(1), Save(3), <br>12: Discipline(1), Save(3), <br>13: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(5), <br>14: Discipline(1), Save(3), <br>15: Discipline(1), Save(3), <br>16: Discipline(1), Save(3), <br>17: Discipline(1), Save(3), <br>18: Hide(8), Move Silently(8), Set Trap(4), Tumble(8), UMD(10), <br>19: Discipline(2), Save(2), <br>20: Discipline(1), Save(3), <br>21: Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Set Trap(4), Tumble(4), <br>22: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(1), Save(7), <br>23: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spellcraft(5), Tumble(1), UMD(5), <br>24: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(4), Tumble(1), Save(3), <br>25: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(1), Save(7), <br>26: Discipline(6), <br>27: Discipline(1), Save(3), <br>28: Discipline(1), Save(3), <br>29: Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Tumble(4), UMD(5), <br>30: Discipline(2), Save(2), <br>31: Save(4), <br>32: Save(4), <br>33: Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Spellcraft(5), Tumble(4), UMD(5), <br>34: Disable Trap(6), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(1), Save(1), <br>35: Discipline(5), <br>36: Discipline(1), Save(3), <br>37: Disable Trap(4), Hide(3), Move Silently(3), Tumble(3), <br>38: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), UMD(5), Save(2), <br>39: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(8), <br>40: Discipline(4)<br><br><br>Feedback and constructive criticism is, as usual, greatly appreciated.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br><br><br><i>Fixed the shield issue - Kail Pendragon</i><br>_________________<br>My enemies rise and look to the skies<br>They pray I will never appear<br>Their life has no meaning<br>Awake they are dreaming<br>They live in a castle of fear<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 02/13/07 09:40</span></i></p>

if 2 rogue levels are given up, this should allow WS/EWS (if taken on a general feat level) with fighter, which, as you are dex based, will be pretty important. the damage from this build is pitiful, without WS/EWS and being dex based, undead will rip you into pieces (albeit concealment helps).<br><br>qualms aside. this is a pretty fine build. nice AB, nice AC etc. this would work well in most environments. another good 'un!<br>_________________<br>Dwarves hate to be mistaken for Gnomes.

the things that this build could really use well would be IKD, as you mentioned, but also ITWF.  with a 48 AB, you can afford to.  but being so tight on feats makes it tough.<br><br>if you are worried about getting hit in lower levels just make sure to get expertise ASAP.  in epic, fighting with expertise on all the time is feasible, even while dual wielding, and still maintaining a 42 AB.<br><br>just a note really.  nothing much bad you can say about a sneak attacking dexer with SCV and ED.  well done.  you achieved your goal, but i think that you sacrificed a lot to get there (feats in this case).  not my cup of tea, but others no doubt will find this quite strong and playable.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>“If you bring a Ranger with you, it is well to pay attention to him...”

This build is very successful at what it wants to do - create a stealthy character who's extremely hard to hit and has a very high AB.  This is definitely not a character you want flanking you unless you're immune to sneak attacks and critical hits.<br><br>I'm a little disappointed not to see some high Search and Open Locks skills on the character though.  With those, he'd be a superb party rogue.  Maybe dump spellcraft for that?  I know his saves can use the help, but nearly maxing it cross-class costs quite a lot of skill points.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Sure, that's sound advice. I always think of skill selection as susceptible to be changed to better fit one's needs. Drop spellcraft and some other points here and there and you'll be able to get high search and open locks.<br><br>And, yes, you don't want this guy to flank you unless you are crit immune. He's gonna hit you and he's gonna hit you hard while you'll have a hard time landing one blow on him. <br>Maybe drop one SC and get crippling strike to get more offensive.

Oh and let me add... congratulations on a build that certainly deserves the "Halfling of Dooooom!" label <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"><br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
