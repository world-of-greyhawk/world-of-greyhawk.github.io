Looking to blend a Sorcerer with a Wizard; but struggling with the DC's of the wiz while allowing the sorcerer class decent lvl9 status.  The idea is, that you can use the sorcerer's 'spamming' ability to cast oodles of non-save spells (bigbies, IGMS, buffs, *breaches*, etc) BUT still have a good save-trashing casting ability from the wizard class; even hellball and epic warding I'm assuming may be possible.<br><br>Anybody out there attempt this or have any advice?<br><br>*the SR-lowering breaches are all non-save; non-resistable spells IIRC, so even a lvl18 sorcerer can use, I'm guessing, to level the playing field a bit*.

The best would propably be sorc 23/wiz 17 - start with 18 int, 16 dex, 12 con and everything else 8, take only 4 wizard levels pre-epic. Put 3 stat adjustments into cha and everything else into int - including those you get at wizard levels 5, 10 and 15. With epic spell focus, this character will have a decent DC on his wizard spells.

Thanks, I'll give that a few turns in the novice-epic mod.<br>While I'm at it; how does epic spell focus help in casting; I was under the impression it only helped when saving against an enemy caster?<br><br>Also; any reason why sorc23 (thinking of spell resistance with the wiz, breaking for PvM [max SR hide in the toolset is 32 IIRC, with epic pen and one mord. disj. you would manage I guess provided no extra SR on the monster?])<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 01/23/05 22:33</span></i></p>

I'd go sorc 18/wiz 21/blackguard 1 (the latter for a heavy armor proficiency without an XP penalty) 4 wizard levels pre-epic, all the wiz bonus feats for great intelligence except the last one (autostill spell II).

With a +12 to INT from items, a DC of 34+spell level, which is pretty good.  Your sorc casting will be a little weak though.  You'll also be able to cast in full plate with a shield and have 1 epic spell (I suggest epic warding).<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Bleh, I have written 16 dex while thinking of 16 cha - everything should be okay now.<br>I've come to an opinion that wiz 22/ sorc 18 is actually better then wiz 17/ sorc 23.<br><br>As for Mithdradates' build - you need at lest 13 str to be a blackguard (for Cleave). Moreover, this character would be short on feats anyway, there would be no point in spending 6 of them only to be able to wear armor. Also, starting with 18 int and 16 cha gives you more skill points.<br><br>Here's a list of feats for the build (wiz 22/ sorc 18):<br>Non-epic:<br>Combat Casting<br>Spell Penetration<br>Greater Spell Penetration<br>Spell Focus (I suggest necromancy)<br>Greater Spell Focus<br>Maximize spell<br>and 2 more - you choose<br>Epic:<br>Improved Combat Casting<br>Epic Spell Focus<br>Epic Spell Penetration<br>5 times Great Intelligence<br>Epic Spell - Epic Mage Armor<br>Epic Spell - Epic Warding<br>and one more - you choose<br><br>Remember to take you 21st Wizard level at level 36 and 22nd at level 39 - take epic spells at these levels.<br><br>You end with:<br>Str 8<br>Dex 8<br>Con 12<br>Int 30<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 19<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tengudor_t on 01/24/05 13:05</span></i></p>

Tengudor, I believe you're correct about the Blackguard thing.  Still, 1 level of Paladin would have largely the same effect (it would get you Heavy Armor Prof. and a nice boost to your saves), so it might be worth considering.  Of course, it DOES cost you 4 extra feats in order to get auto-still spell 3, but considering how much it boosts your AC it very well might be worth it.

Wearing armor requires high str, at least 12 - unless you want to become *very* slow each time someone dispells your buffs. I myself believe that it is worth only if you have many spare feats or plan to become a spellsword.

I'm sorry to come back in at a late time - but why are we arguing about heavy armor feats?  <br>A spellcaster should not wear heavy armor, since they are sacrificing 4 feats to get autostill in the first place, and can't wear it until they get the autostill anyways.  Pally or blackguard, is useful for the saves and discipline [to avoid kd as much as possible] I would certainly agree though; as well as the healing ability of the Pally.  Though monk is more useful to get evasion and discipline + tumble..
