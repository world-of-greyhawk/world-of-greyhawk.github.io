Nifty.  <br><br>Taking Ranger at 40 makes for a long wait to get dual-wield.  If playing through from level 1, I'd consider taking 4 levels of Ranger pre-epic to get the extra attack per round.  That'd drop your Sneak Attack a bit and you'd lose a Rogue bonus feat through, so it is a tradeoff.  And of course, doing the Ranger levels early means you don't get to max Ranger class skills at 40, if that matters to you.<br><br>Depending on your play style, Lasting Inspiration might be nice, but requires an extra Bard level.  That plus the additional Ranger levels would put you at Bard 21/Rogue 15/Ranger 4.  No worse on the Sneak Attack than Rogue 16 would be, but losing two Rogue bonus feats hurts.  Hmmm, maybe Lasting Inspiration isn't all that important after all...<br><br>I did a Bard/Rogue/Ranger build too, but I went a lot heavier on Bard.  Too heavy, according to many people, and they're probably right.  But a 30th level Bardsong is a thing of beauty! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"> <br><br>Edit - here's a link to my build:  <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "169450", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>_________________<br>Disarm?

Thanks for the feedback!<br><br>In order... As you say, dual wield at 40 is a pain. In fact, the real reason I took 1 ranger level was the bonus feat, more than dualwield. Having to choose between fighter and ranger, I chose ranger: same feat, but the ranger gives more skill points and more class skills.<br>To get 4 ApR I'd need to go at least 20 bard/16 rogue/4 ranger(fighter).<br>Problem is, you get XP penalty no matter what, and since this build is for PvM mostly I couldn't afford it.<br><br>Lasting impression requires bard 20. I'm sure, I built this char in test and I took the feat. I think the exact requirements are 20 uses of bard song per day...but don't quote me here.<br>I find lasting imp. really useful, because you can save most of your bard song uses for cursing, and they are never enough!<br><br>I looked at your build, it's nice. I thought about lvl 30 song at first, when designing this build, but decided that 100 perform wuold be too much gear (and world) dependant...Your build is great for partying, it's harder to solo because it misses what every other dex based bard build misses: damage output. I tried to compensate with heavy sneak attack presence and many ways to provide them: stealth, IKD + curse song namely.<br><br>Thanks again for feedback!

Welcome to your first post!<br><br>Interesting build. A few thoughts...<br><br>1.You say you couldn't drop Imp. Crit for Exotic Weapons....I believe Grizz has argued that for a sneak-attack based character crit range doesn't matter. He even suggested fighting with 1d1 twigs <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">   <br><br>2. Since your sneak attacks are dependent on Knockdown, (and because I think they make better Rogues) I'd suggest going Elf to avoid the small-size Knockdown penalty. You would incur an XP penalty pre-epic while your Rogue and Bard levels were off (eg. Rogue 8/Bard 12). Going Elf would also permit focus in Rapier or Short Sword.<br><br>3. I don't like that one level of Ranger so late in the build just for Dual Wield. You could take Fighter instead to get Imp. Two Weapon fighting and boost your pre-epic AB. What about going Dwarf Rogue 16/Bard 20/Fighter 4? (Pre-Epic: Rogue 8/Bard 8/Fighter 4)? (Of course that would impact your Bardic abilities with a borked Charisma but you could avoid the Elf's early XP penalty and have a Dwarf's late XP penalty....)<br><br>4. On a different track, you could ditch Ranger and take Shadow Dancer at level 21 and use HIPS to milk IKD and Sneak Attacks.<br><br>5. Or, there is always the Bard/Shadow Dancer/Black Guard route too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">   <br><br>Kaliban<br><br>PS - Note to bpickle: You can get Lasting Inspiration with only 20 levels of Bard (eg. take Bard 20 at level 39).<br>_________________<br><i>This space for rent</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kaliban99 on 09/13/05 13:34</span></i></p>

I'll give some reasons...<br><br>1)If I take imp crit(dagger) I fight with a 1d4 (17-20/*2) weapon.<br>If I take exotic prof instead of imp.crit I fight with a 1d4(18-20/*2) weapon (kukri). That's why the dagger with improved critical is better: same damage and multiplier, and bigger critical threat.<br><br>2) Going elf is something I really thought about. <br>By going elf you would: <br>-use rapier or hand axe (remember keen edge) instead of dagger<br>-get no malus on the knockdown roll<br>Cons are:<br>-xp penalty (or level in different way, which hurts the build, imho<br>-you lose 1ab, 1ac, 1 to saves from halfling bonuses (size, and racial luck).<br><br>it's a close call, and probably a matter of personal preference, personally I never played halfling and this was my attempt <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>3) I've already explained this, however... Last level of ranger gives me: 1 feat (epic prowess) and dual wield. It's better than a single fighter level because you get more skill pnts, better skillset (hide and move silently), and dual wield is a bonus. <br>This build will wear a large shield, it only gives -2 to armor check and gives 2 AC plus any bonus it may have. Dualwielding is an option to use should you found that useful, example: you're fighting a lich (low ac), and you don't need AC yourself, cause he's a spellcaster: swap to dual wield, lose some AC, but gain damage output.<br><br>Taking 4 fighter preepic and going 20 bard, 16 rogue, 4 fighter is doable, but XP penalty is unavoidable, sadly. Going dwarf cuts charisma which I need for casting bardic spells (and song btw). Better to go human in this case and live with xp penalty.<br><br>4) That's where this build was born. Unluckily, I couldn't fit in dodge and mobility in the preepic progression. Maybe you could go human, drop improved critical, and take SD at 21...but you lose 2 AB, 2 AC,  1 to all saves (2 to ref) and 1 epic feat (crippling strike, maybe) over the original halfling build...hard call.<br><br>5) It's a good way to put that cha you have to good use to boost saves (a shame you can't make pally/bards ...). But it's basicly another build: you have better BAB, but you miss e-dodge, crippling strike, ... Also you need 13 str for the blackguard prerequisites (cleave) which hits dex or con...<br><br>keep comments coming!

As for the dagger vs kukri thing. A bard can get keen edgae spell, which will get you 15-20 crit range with kukri's. I f you have easy access to keen weapons, they will be even, 15-20, so it will truly be only personal preference. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Shouldn't that be 12-20 if the kukris are keened? 18-20 without Imp. Crit (crit range of 3). Imp crit doubles it to 15-20 (crit range of 6). Add Keen on top of that and it becomes 3x normal range 12-20 (crit range of 9).
