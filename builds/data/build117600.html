I just found my CD so here's my build for the Shifter right now.<br><br>At level 40 he (or she) is a level 23 Druid, level 16 Shifter, and level 1 Monk. I may switch 3 of the Druid levels to Shifter ones, because I think I may have missed some of the Epic Shifter classes.<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>For the extra feat and skill points.<br><br>Starting stats:<br><br>Str 8<br>Dex 8<br>Con 10<br>Wis 16<br>Int 14<br>Cha 14<br><br>This is primarily because the character is designed to fight in his shifted forms, so he doesn't need physical attributes. The reason Constitution is a 10, is because it gives him more hit points, and the Drow form causes you to lose 2 constitution so it's also to avoid a 6 there.<br><br>Skills: Heal 40, Concentration 40, Listen 30, Spot 30, Spellcraft 40, Tumble Maxed, Lore Maxed, Persuade Maxed.<br><br>The last 2 aren't needed but I prefer to be able to identify everything for free, and persuade people. Also, some of these skills might be what the final score in them was. I was trying to round some of them off.<br><br>Level progession:<br><br>Level 1: Druid 1, Courteous Mageocracy, Silver Palm<br>Level 2: Druid 2<br>Level 3: Druid 3, Improved Initiative<br>Level 4: Druid 4, +1 Wis (19)<br>Level 5: Druid 5<br>Level 6: Druid 6, Alertness<br>Level 7: Druid 7<br>Level 8: Shifter 1, +1 Wis (20)<br>Level 9: Shifter 2, Weapon Specialization (Unarmed Strike)<br>Level 10: Shifter 3<br>Level 11: Shifter 4<br>Level 12: Shifter 5, Weapon Finesse, +1 Wis (21<br>Level 13: Shifter 6<br>Level 14: Shifter 7<br>Level 15: Shifter 8, Improved Critical (unarmed strike)<br>Level 16: Shifter 9, +1 Wis (22)<br>Level 17: Shifter 10<br>Level 18: Druid 8, Expertise<br>Level 19: Druid 9<br>Level 20: Druid 10, +1 Wis (23)<br>Level 21: Shifter 11, Great Charisma I (24)<br>Level 22: Shifter 12<br>Level 23: Shifter 13, Undead Shape<br>Level 24: Shifter 14, Outsider Shape, +1 Wis (25)<br>Level 25: Shifter 15<br>Level 26: Druid 11<br>Level 27: Druid 12, Armor Skin<br>Level 28: Druid 13, +1 Wis (26)<br>Level 29: Druid 14<br>Level 30: Druid 15, Superior Initiative<br>Level 31: Druid 16<br>Level 32: Druid 17, +1 Wis (27)<br>Level 33: Druid 18, Improved Expertise<br>Level 34: Druid 19<br>Level 35: Druid 20<br>Level 36: Druid 21, Great Charisma II (28), +1 Wis (29)<br>Level 37: Druid 22<br>Level 38: Druid 23, Great Charisma III (30)<br>Level 39: Shifter 16, Construct Shape, Dragon Shape<br>Level 40: Monk 1, +1 Str (9)<br><br>First 2 feats at first level again are because I like high Lore, and Persuade, so they can be changed out if desired. Armor skin also isn't neccessary, but is nice to have, since I was going for a high AC build. Expertise is in there to help with AC until you get the Monk level, and the Initiative bonus is for your low Dex in case you get attacked when not shifted,or for those forms with low Dex. Weapon Finesse is for those forms with higher dexterity, and the weapon specialization of unarmed strike as well as improved critical is entirely for those forms without weapons. The Monk level is added for Tumble (not a real big thing), and for the wisdom bonus to AC, as well as a minor bonus to unarmed strike damage. The other feats you get are also pretty nice.<br><br>He may be weak on his own with about 200-400 HP, and the following stats...<br><br>AB: +23/+20/+17/+14/+11<br>Damage: 1-6 -1 (19-20/x2)<br>Fort: 24<br>Ref: 19<br>Will: 30<br>AC: 29<br><br>...but he has a lot of buff spells, and like I mentioned earlier, He'll be fighting in his shifted forms. The greatest of these forms, the dragon, is shown below.<br><br>AB: +43/+40/+37/+34/+31<br>Damage: 2-12 +19 (19-20/x2)<br>2-12 +19 (19-20/x2)<br>2-16 +19 (19-20/x2)<br>Fort: 35<br>Ref: 33<br>Will: 30<br>AC: 63<br><br>Again, this is without any equipment, or spell buffs. The spells you want to memorize will likely be buff, and healing only, since you can't cast spells while shifted (although I would think you could as a dragon, drow, kobold, or any other form that can speak, or at least speak common).<br><br>Anyways, I'm thinking I need to substitute 3 of the druid levels for 3 Shifter levels, mainly because I think at level 19 Shifter, you get some of your Shifter Shapes to Epic level. It also makes it to where you can get Great Charisma on the last few levels, and still get Outsider Shape, since you have to actually level as a Shifter to get that style of feats.<br><br>Any comments, and suggestions are welcome, but please try not to chew off my head as this is only my first build around my favorite kind of character, the Shifter.<br><br>EDIT: Minor spelling fixes, and added bit about added unarmed strike damage from monk. Also fixed minor problem with levelling chart, as I re-worked it from what I had actually done.<br>_________________<br>Dray'Gon,<br>The draconian prince of a lost kingdom.<br><br>Edited By Dray'Gon on 03/06/04 15:02:33<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 16:16</span></i></p>
