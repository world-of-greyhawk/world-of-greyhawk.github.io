I got this idea somewhat based on Avenging Commando build.  I wanted a character with a little more "permanent" non-buff/spell enhanced offensive power, even against enemies immune to criticals and sneak attacks (which seems to make up majority of higher level monsters in many mods).<br><br>I made two variations... one elf, and one human.  Human was the more powerful build, so I decided to list that one.  If anyone wants to see the elf version, well, it's significantly weaker due to race difference.<br><br>Starting Stats<br>Human Rogue<br>Str 15<br>Dex 8<br>Con 12<br>Wis 14<br>Int 14<br>Chr 14<br><br>1 Rogue1 Feat: Power Attack, Cleave<br>2 Paladin1<br>3 Paladin2 Feat: Blind Fighting<br>4 Paladin3 Ability: Str (str16)<br>5 Paladin4<br>6 Paladin5 Feat: Divine Might<br>7 Rogue2<br>8 Fighter1 Feat: Knockdown Ability: Str (str17)<br>9 Paladin6 Feat: Divind Shield<br>10 Fighter2 Feat: Weapon Focus<br>11 Paladin7<br>12 Rogue3 Feat: Improved Knockdown Ability: Str (str18)<br>13 Fighter3<br>14 Fighter4 Feat: Weapon Specialization<br>15 Paladin8 Feat: Improved Critical<br>16 Paladin9 Ability: Str (str19)<br>17 Rogue4<br>18 Paladin10 Feat: Greater Cleave<br>19 Paladin11<br>20 Paladin12 Ability: Str (str20)<br>21 Fighter5 Feat: Great Strength I (str21)<br>22 Rogue5<br>23 Paladin13<br>24 Rogue6 Feat: Great Strength II Ability: Str (str23)<br>25 Fighter6 Feat: Overwhelming Critical<br>26 Fighter7<br>27 Rogue7 Feat: Great Strength III (str24)<br>28 Fighter 8 Feat: Devastating Critical Ability: Str (str25)<br>29 Rogue8<br>30 Paladin14 Feat:Epic Weapon Focus<br>31 Fighter9<br>32 Rogue9 Ability: Str (str26)<br>33 Fighter10 Feat: Epic Weapon Specialization Great Charsima (chr15)<br>34 Rogue10 Feat: Improved Evasion or defensive roll<br>35 Fighter11<br>36 Rogue11 Feat: Toughness Ability Chr (chr16)<br>37 Fighter12 Feat: Armor Skin<br>38 Rogue12<br>39 Fighter13 Feat: Great Charisma (chr17)<br>40 Fighter14 Feat: Epic Prowess Ability Chr (chr18)<br><br>Finishing stats<br>Str 26<br>Dex 8<br>Con 12<br>Wis 14<br>Int 14<br>Chr 18<br><br>Skill points 305<br>HP: 412<br>Saving throw: Fort(28) Ref(22) Will (22)<br>BAB: 41/36/31/26 with normal weapon of choice<br>AC: 19, naked.  Probably should wear heavy armor, find a way of increasing dex by at least 4 (which isn't that hard, seeing as how dex is the most common stat to be increased... bracer of dexterity would suffice)<br><br>Saving throw can, of course, be improved by increasing relevant ability scores and charisma.  As for skill points distribution, I recommend, at minimum, 40 tumble and 41 UMD.  The rest can be distributed as you see fit for the mod / PW you happen to be playing in.<br><br>As for weapon, I suppose the standard would be longsword, although if holy avenger version of rapier or scimitar is available, that probably would be the better choice for trade off of avg 1 dmg for increased critical range.<br><br>Now, for a little tweak (and preference, really), you could drop paladin level to 13 and increase rogue level to 13 for another rogue bonus feat.  Personally, though, for non-dex build, I really don't like most of the rogue bonus feats.  In addition, I liked havnig the option of being able to cast lvl 4 paladin spells if I ever find a +4 wisdom item.  Which really shouldn't be all that hard by lvl 30+.<br><br>For that single rogue class feat, I recommend improved evasion or defensive roll.  Slippery mind isn't horrible, but, by that level, there should be a few items that protects PC from mind affecting spells.  I considered crippling strike, but, once again, there are too many enemies that are immune to SA at higher levels.  And those that aren't immune... they tend to be cannon fodders.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By NeoRequiem on 12/11/07 04:54</span></i></p>

You need atleast 15 levels of Paladin to have access to level 4 spells. I would go for more Paladin levels and less Fighter.

Paladins get access to lvl 4 spells at lvl 14.  Unfortunately, the number of lvl 4 spells that paladin get at that level is, well, 0.  However, this can be mitigated by increasing wisdom score to at least 18, which gives +1 bonus spells to lvl 1,2,3,and 4(yay).<br><br>As for "less fighter, more paladin" suggestion.  While that's certainly an option (for example, let's say paladin 16 fighter 12), that will require the sacrifice of one feat... whether such be epic prowess, armor skin, toughness, etc etc.<br><br>Frankly, I didn't think the sacrifice was worth the benefit, although, of course, your opinion may differ.

This IS something that can be covered by a nice little spell or 2 that the pal has!  to loose 2 to ab for 2 to saves when you can easily make up for the difference with spells, im not sure of your reasoning here.  The suggestion to take more pal is a good one.  So you loose toughness in epic or imp kd (with dev crit kdin may be longer than you need).<br><br>Imvho, with dev crit you really need to add to str for ab AND dev crit dc.  In the end it is easier to have 30 str than 18 charisma.  Maybe even up to 32 str.<br><br>note that these are just twinkin ideas.  They are the way I would play your build, nothing more.  Of course, I would have done a cleric with dev crit at 21 and ..  butt that is me.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

On a side note...<br><br>...I realized that I could have beefed up AB a bit more (probably by 4) if I took dwarf as race and started with rogue charisma 6, never increasing charisma and always investing in str.<br><br>However, I thought, "hey, this is paladin... he needs relatively high charisma for RP purpose!".<br><br>If I was going to modify this build for more munchiken purpose, then I would go with your suggestion and take charisma to minimum.  I might even sacrifice intelligence, give up IKD, and increase con.<br><br>Of course, those sacrifice would make it more difficult for immersion in playing through mods, so make it what you will.
