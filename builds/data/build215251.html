Key things with this is BARD SONG, CURSE SONG, and LISTENING (for sneakers o.O). Yes this build CAN be used in PVM but NOT recommended, I have tested on a PVM server, but as always it was a rocky start. Yes yes I am aware that there is an ALINGMENT CHANGE, but usualy on an RP server you can work your way towards this goal. I have played this character on several servers and the DM always allowed me to RP my way into Lawful and then back out.<br><br>Thanks, Good Luck <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br><br><br>----DarkInferNo<br><br>(EDIT) Careless mistakes.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DarkInfernoo on 10/04/05 20:46</span></i></p>

I'm playing around with a Blackgaurd build very similar... with no alignment shifts needed. Oh and the "Man" likes it when you put a note where you need a shift. The "Man" thinks it looks more presentable. The "Man" most have more hours in a day than the rest of us... LOL. I'd probably put a few more points into Charisma though... just a suggestion.

Foor the Divine damage mainly... most creatures (or characters) don't have a defense from this... I'd put 4  more points into CHA and take 4 from Dex... AB isn't going to be much of a problem so I'd prefer to do more damage for a longer period of time. That or I wouldn't take the Divine feats. Plus it will give you better saves.

How curious. I never noticed this build before. Anyway here's my build with the same classes, posted a little more than a month before this one: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "210267", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>As for the last poster, the AB is, AFAIK, 28 +7 +8 +3 +1 = 47 and AC would be 10 +7 +2 +8 = 27.
