I'm not too sure about the others (Vincent would be impossible for one due to extreme speed and flexibility, along with shapeshifting and using a gun) but what strikes me a possible would be Aeris.<br><br>Race: Elf/Half Elf (Closest thing to Cetra you'll find)<br>Gender: Female<br>Age: 22<br><br>Mainclass: Cleric<br>Subclass: Perhaps sorcerer..?<br><br>Domains: Healing and Protection (or mabye War)<br><br>Alignement: Lawful Good<br><br>Abilities:<br>Str: 8<br>Dex: 14<br>Con: 10<br>Wis: 16<br>Int: 12(or 10)<br>Cha: 15(16 if 10 int) (She is very beautiful after all, and you need at least 15 cha to be called beautiful, even more so to be allowed to add "very")<br><br>If you don't feel like heal, then take 10 Int and 16 Cha, that was my initial plan.<br>Skills: Concentration, Spellcraft and Heal.<br><br>Feat suggestions:<br>Extend spell, Empower Spell, WF: Quarterstaff, Spellfocus: Conjuration, Greater spellfocus: Conjuration, Spellfocus: Abjuration, Greater spellfocus: Abjuration.<br><br>And so on. Great wis and mabye a few great Cha feats in epic levels.<br><br>Conjuration since all healing spells are of that school, along with some key protection spells, and Abjuration for other key protection spells.<br><br>These are only my thought and suggestions, please dont hate/slay/ban me for them.<br><br>Yay, now I'll go hide.

Who says you need at least 15 CHA to be called beautiful? CHA is far, far more than physical beauty. In fact, I can think of a few absolutely drop-dead gorgeous women I've met in real life that I'd peg with 8 or less CHA because their personality completely sucked. Just a few minutes being around them was enough to make me want to just punch them in the head.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Well, thats a good point. Lots of those out there.<br><br>However, Aeris did manage to persuade Cloud into guarding her (we all know he's a woodhead, but nonetheless), and everyone who met her (except Shinra) loved her for the fantastic person she was. That counts for some personality doesnt it..?

If we stick to 3.0 or 3.5 it says charisma is a balance of many things including physical beauty. The older editions of D&amp;D had specific stats if I remember correctly, but who wants to go back to 18/00 Str?
