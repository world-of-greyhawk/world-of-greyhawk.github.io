I have never played a cleric type (I have tested some cleric zen archers, but not more) and I wish to start one.<br><br>The plan is playing a cleric on a low magic (I'm not sure when a server really a low magic server, this one has very few +5 items for level 20+ characters) PW with very low advancement.<br><br>My plan is to make an effective fighter/caster who could survive most situations along his career, deal good melee damage and still being able to buff and kill creatures with spells when his melee isn't effective. I try to max his fighting skills before because resting (at the wilderness) costs money (because you need camp kits) in that server and, at early levels money is very scarce, so I start as a fighter and then turn into a cleric. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>He is mostly for PvM (It's a RP server with full PvP so I can avoid PvPing if I am enough diplomatic. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   ).<br><br>This is the build I came with:<br>Note: The skills are in intervals of 5 in order to improve readability.<br><br>Human Cleric 20/Fighter 10/CoT 10 <br><br>Starting stats:<br>STR: 16 (26)<br>DEX: 8 //I can always drop a cat's grace<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 16 (20)<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Feats:<br>Level 1: Weapon Focus: Greatsword, Power Attack, Cleave<br>Level 2: Knockdown<br>Level 3: Toughness<br>Level 4: Weapon Specialization: Greatsword<br>Level 6: Extend Spell<br>Level 9: Combat Casting, Blind Fight<br>Level 11: Improved Knockdown<br>Level 12: Spell Penetration<br>Level 13: Improved Critical: Greatsword<br>Level 15: Empower Spell<br>Level 18: Maximize Spell<br>Level 20: Great Cleave<br>Level 21: Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword, Epic Weapon Specialization: Greatsword<br>Level 24: Great Strength I<br>Level 25: Overwhelming Critical: Greatsword<br>Level 27: Great Strength II<br>Level 28: Devastating Critical: Greatsword<br>Level 29: Great Strength III<br>Level 33: Epic Prowess<br>Level 36: Great Wisdom I<br>Level 39: Greater Spell Penetration, Armor Skin<br><br>Stat increases:<br>Str: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28<br>Wis: 32, 36, 40<br><br>01: Fighter(1): Disable Trap(2), Discipline(4), Open Lock(2)<br>02: Fighter(2): <br>03: Fighter(3):<br>04: Fighter(4): STR+1 (STR=17)<br>05: Cleric(1)<br>06: Cleric(2):<br>07: Cleric(3): Concentration(10), Spellcraft(10), Tumble(5)<br>08: Champion of Torm(1): STR+1 (STR=18)<br>09: Champion of Torm(2): <br>10: Champion of Torm(3)<br>11: Champion of Torm(4): Discipline(10)<br>12: Champion of Torm(5): STR+1 (STR=19)<br>13: Champion of Torm(6): <br>14: Cleric(4): Spellcraft(5)<br>15: Cleric(5): <br>16: Cleric(6): STR+1 (STR=20)<br>17: Cleric(7): Concentration(10), Tumble(5)<br>18: Champion of Torm(7): <br>19: Fighter(5): Disable Trap(5), Open Lock(5)<br>20: Fighter(6): STR+1 (STR=21)<br>21: Champion of Torm(8): Discipline(10)<br>22: Cleric(8): Spellcraft(5)<br>23: Cleric(9)<br>24: Champion of Torm(9): STR+1 (STR=23)<br>25: Champion of Torm(10): <br>26: Cleric(10)<br>27: Fighter(7): (STR=24) Concentration(10), Tumble(5)<br>28: Fighter(8): STR+1 (STR=25), Discipline(5)<br>29: Cleric(11): Disable Trap(3), Spellcraft(10)<br>30: Cleric(12): (STR=26)<br>31: Cleric(13)<br>32: Cleric(14): WIS+1 (WIS=17), Spellcraft(5)<br>33: Cleric(15): <br>34: Cleric(16)<br>35: Cleric(17)<br>36: Cleric(18): WIS+1 (WIS=19)<br>37: Cleric(19): Concentration(10), Spellcraft(5), Tumble(5)<br>38: Fighter(9): Discipline(5), Open Lock(6)<br>39: Fighter(10): Discipline(8)<br>40: Cleric(20): WIS+1 (WIS=20), Concentration(3), Spellcraft(3)<br><br>Domains: Trickery/Magic (There are few haste items so travel could be a good option, but I plan having a haste item someday <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    and magic has nice spells IMHO).<br><br>Final skills:<br>Disable Trap 10(12)<br>Open Lock 13(12) //I wont need a rogue for low level chests, plus, with trickery I can boost this and open most of the chests I will find in my PW<br>Discipline 42(50)<br>Concentration 43(44)<br>Spellcraft 43(45)<br>Tumble 20(19)<br>//I still have 1 skillpoint I dont know where to place <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   <br><br>Unbuffed Saves:<br>Note: (43 spellcraft, 45 with stats, I assume a +9 bonus)<br>Fort: 31 (40)<br>Will: 29 (38)<br>Reflex: 23 (32)<br><br>(Unbuffed) AB: 28(Base) + 8(str) +1(WF) +2(EWF) +1(Epic Prowess) = 40AB<br><br>(Unbuffed) Naked AC = 10(Base) -1(8 dex) +2(Armor skin) +4(tumble) = 15AC<br><br>Questions:<br>Should I Get Epic spell penetration?<br><br>If so, which one is better?<br>- Drop Armor skin and one Great Wisdom or great Str in order to get 22 cleric levels and epic spell penetration?<br>- Take 9 pre-epic levels (instead of 7) dropping Thoughness/maximize spell (and 1 AB) and trading 1 great wisdom for epic spell penetration?<br><br>I mean, is it that useful?<br><br>What do you guys think?

Without really checking your build to good, I can say this; Take your CoT levs epic, and you can use the bonus feats from it to take Great wisdom, saves some ability gains to put in strength, and that will boost attack and damage.<br>Didn't study your feats to good, but it should be doable. will not affect overall build, remember CoT also gives you EWS.

Thanks for the feedback.<br><br>About the CoT levels epic, that would hurt the AB slighly...<br>Moving 4 cleric to pre-epic (and CoT to epic) and trading the spell penetrations for great wisdoms (Extra CoT feats) would allow me to take 2 more great str and make the AB to not to change. True enough. Thanks a lot.<br><br>About the Cat's grace. I didn't know about that. I should have to check the Plant domain (and compare it to Magic), on the worst case I think I can live without that 2 AC or rely on items or potions.<br>_________________<br>Over Seven Years of High Quality RP. <a href="http://www.mytharria.org" target="_blank">www.mytharria.org</a> We offer a unique world with player based religions &amp; governments.

I like your build, he is much of a character designed to be able to take damage while he can cast a few buffs or even offensive spells. And he will be GREAT in a PW with Dev.Crit. disabled. (If I ever design str a melee build without Dev.Crit. I will give him a scythe <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"> ). The only thing I miss on him is IKD, I have found it to be terribly useful, even when you are trying to be deffensive (Always one of my melee tanks tries to hold an enemy while the magic casters fry it I use knockdown constantly on him. While the enemy is down he cant harm anybody nor run anywhere <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> ).<br><br>Mine is more goes more for the offensive Melee character (IKD, Dev. Crit.) with buffs who is able to cast a few nice spells if his melee skills aren't strong enough (Harm/Mass Heal, Implosion <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  or even a Storm of vengeance to soften a room).<br><br>Thanks for the comments, I think he is quite round right now. I'm wondering if I should name give him and place it in the Character Builds thread.<br>_________________<br>Over Seven Years of High Quality RP. <a href="http://www.mytharria.org" target="_blank">www.mytharria.org</a> We offer a unique world with player based religions &amp; governments.

Hmm, many immune to KD items on the server, but KD can be taken at 18, and i think Dev crit can be worked in. Your build seems quite complete, because as with all clerics, the few BAB you lack from cleric levs is regained with the divine power spell. I have found this type of builds to be somewhat effective vs mages even, nice saves, some sr, and enough heals and hp to wear out the mage. With heal domain you have access to heal on two different caster levs. AC is the downside on my build, and also with yours. I can see no way to improve on it without compromising to much of the build. And you should post it, it is a good build IMO.
