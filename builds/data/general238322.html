I find your post hard to understand, really. Anyhow, I believe you were asking if Bards gain any bonuses from PM (regarding spells). The answer is yes, they do; they gain spell slots, but they do not gain new spells.<br>_________________<br>"And one calculates <i>time</i> from the <i>dies nefastus</i> on which this fatality arose – from the <i>first</i> day of Christianity! – <i>Why not rather from its last?</i> – <i>From today?</i> – Revaluation of all values!"

But it won't benefit a lvl 20 bard as he is, since that's the max amount of slots. <br><br>Also Bards get something called Lasting inspiration, take your 20th bard lvl on a feat level and grab that feat.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

I'd also juggle around those levels.  Take one of your last levels as Bard and you can max out your tumble.  You'll also have more points to dump into perform/disc/UMD.<br><br>Taking 8 RDD pre epic might not affect your BAB to much, and it will grant you extra those +2 INT points sooner for those skills.

Thanks for the advice guys trying to juggle between each class is hard..seams complex when making epic characters..any way trying another combo,how does this sound monk lv 20/wizard lv 5/palemaster lv 15?

Sounds better if you go bard for UMD/tumble, taking the first three at epic levels and the last at 40 to max skills.

Rhonda, what are you looking for?   Simply giving class combos tells us nothing about what you want!  If you would like help, please create a build progression and post it here (not under epic builds) and we will help you with it!  This will give us something concrete to work with.<br><br>Peace
