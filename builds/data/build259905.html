I recently made this build which dual wields Bastard Swords and thought I would post. You dont get the dual wield feats until level 15. I suggest using a bastard sword and shield until atleast level 15 maybe even later than that with the AB penalties. I know its not the best choice to dual wield these weapons, but I just wanted to make a big baddie who does. Will save is dreadfully low, but not much can be done about that with this build being so feat starved.<br><br>Fighter 10/ Barbarian 17/ Weapon Master 13<br><br>Human<br>Any Non-Lawful<br>1-40 PvM (untesed PvP)<br><br>STR 16 (30) <br>DEX 15<br>CON 14 <br>INT 14 <br>WIS 8 <br>CHA 8 <br><br>Max HPs 514<br>BAB 30<br>AB 46/41/36/31 (w/bastard sword)<br>   42/37/32/27 42/37 (dual bastards)<br>   1-10+16     1-10+11<br>   15-20/x3 crit range<br>AC 18 (naked) 28 (plate/tower)<br><br>Saves<br><br>Fort 24<br>Reflex 20<br>Will 14 (17 w/rage)<br><br>Skills (211 points) <br><br>Discipline 43 <br>Intimidate 43 <br>Listen 43<br>Taunt 43 <br>Tumble 20<br>Spell Craft 18<br>Points Left 1<br><br>1.

Forgot to mention all saves are +4 vs spells and forgot to post links to similar builds. The 2 month old is up...so I will try to get to that later. Thanks!<br>_________________<br>"This is where we fight! This is where they die!"

Well, double wielding bastard swords sure is rare, won't be my choice, but it's your build... 13 Weapon Master levels is probably hurting the build you know, it's too low to really take advantage of its AB bonus, you'd do better dropping it to 7 and increasing Fighter to 16, that will net +2 feats, which can be used to take EWF and EWS as bonus feats leaving space for 2 GSTR, that will increase damage by 1 with no AB loss.<br><br>Nice build.

Unless you take a second weapon at WM13, it's actually the only thing worse than going only 7, which Thax clearly illustrates.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Thanks for the replies. I never build for the most powerful build, just for the character that I have in mind at the time. In this case...a big bad evil dude dual wielding two big bastard swords. So, I know that a lot of my builds could be improved upon. <br><br>How does picking another weapon at Weapon Master level 13 work? Do you just have to have Weapon Focus in a different weapon or is there more to it?<br>_________________<br>"This is where we fight! This is where they die!"

There's a beer called Double Bastard. I vote that you rename this build Double Bastard and that you require those who use this build to drink Double Bastard while they play the Double Bastard. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

You can pick a second Weapon of Choice if you have a second Weapon Focus, and of course spend a feat in it, but what Grim said is that's even worse, just don't do it, it's a waste of 2 feats and WM levels.
