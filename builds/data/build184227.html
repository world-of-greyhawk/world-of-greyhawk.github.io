check your ab against actual rolls in the combat window.  there are display bugs related to that.  Magic AB bonuses cap out at +20, so if you cast true strike, you won't get additional bonuses beyond that.<br><br>I calculate the max ab of your build to be:<br><br>ab<br>26 base<br>11 aa<br>18 wis (46 wis with items/buffs)<br>3 epic weapon focus<br>1 epic prowess<br>20 true strike<br>----------<br>79<br><br>this should be high enough to hit everything without any trouble.  Rely on cleric buffs to boost ab after true strike runs out.<br><br>you can also raise your bab by one by taking two wizard levels pre-epic.<br><br>I'd recommend switching around your stats so you can get rapid shot (13 dex required).  Rapid shot gives you another attack per round, but it lowers your ab by 2 for all attacks.  This build has such high ab, that -2 won't be missed at all.  Also called shot is very important for an archer.  You can effectively keep enemies at range by repeatedly hitting them with called-shot legs.<br><br>Your build also does not do a lot of damage.  One way for this kind of build to increase the damage output is to take the divine might feat and increase your charisma.  Even with 18 or 19 wisdom, you'll be able to have 60+ ab from aa levels and cleric buffs.  Devote the rest of your stat boosts to cha and you'll get a bunch of irresistable divine damage added to your attacks.<br><br>You may also want to consider using bard instead of wizard for your arcane class.  Bard gains a little damage from song, plus the tumble and umd skills.  You lose truestrike and gain an xp penalty, so you may not want to go that route.

this actually looks like a fun build, you would have to make a few changes to maximize some of the beneftis, but this could be fun.

charisma is kind of wasted without divine might ...<br><br>I'd reduce the pumping wisdom quite a bit, pump charma and take divine might (you'll need Str of 13+)<br><br><br>I'm working on a very similar build and it gives rather nice damage for an archer.

ok, so here goes.<br>1: power attack<br>3: Divine Might<br>6: Divine shield<br>9: Weapon Focus Long<br>12: zen archery<br>15: point blank<br>18: exstend<br><br>thats the pre epic feats, <br>the epic feats take at AA bonus lvls should epic prowess and EWeap Focus<br>you also have 7 epic feats which should be balanced between cha and wis.<br><br>I would suggest you start the build with stats of 16 15 or 17 16 in wis cha respectively. that should allow you make them even out with the 7 epic feats.<br><br><br>now, heres something important.<br>if you make pre epic cleric 8 wis 2 AA 10 then you do get +1 BAB, but you loose lvl 18 of cleric, not much, but its something. <br><br>If you take bard, you need only 1 lvl of bard, so you keep your current BAB, but you loose create scroll feat wich wiz gets automatically (this can be a really good thing in some cases like summoning a meat shield, or heal and harm or what not) but you gain some AC (2 point from tumble) and you gain UMD and you get a lot more class skills that you might need to be independant. One more thing that you loose is a fairy which is good for unlocking doors and such.<br><br>One more choice is to take or not to take lvl 22 of AA, its a free feat, but you cant take much on it. you would have to sacrifise a cleric lvl for this and going bellow cleric lvl 17 I ould not advise.<br><br>War domain seems like a good choice as always,<br>second choice? travel or tickery?

I'd be tempted to leave wisdom close to where it is and focus on CHA for divine damage.  I'd have to see what the AB would end up being, but 21 AA gives you +11 right there.  So, you won't have the unbelieveably high AB an Arcane Archer can get, but in general, that degree of AB uberness is unnecessary.  You could still come out with a perfectly useable AB while managing more damage per hit.<br><br>Steve
