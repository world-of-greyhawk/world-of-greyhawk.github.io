Need some help to optimize this build.   My PW uses +5 gear and you can easily get the +12 to stats.  Need to have 20 levels of mage type to qualify for palemaster.  With this in mind I was looking at a 20 wiz/18 pale/2 monk type character.  No still spell feats and want to optimize wis ac bonus of monk and dex bonuses for ac.  The real goal is to maximize AC and have some casting power left over for IGMS, Icestorm, etc.<br><br>Was thinking something like this<br><br>1-20 wizard<br>21 monk skill dump<br>22-38 palemaster<br>39 monk - skill dump<br>40 palemaster<br><br>Any thoughts?

It's no good to take a lot of WIS and DEX. High INT to raise your spell's DC is more important IMO, because to get a really high AC from WIS and DEX you'd need to lower INT too much.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Is going w/out armor a necessity?  Seems if you want to optimize AC that's the way to do it.

Maybe you can get more AC going for auto-stilled... But IMO, you should go Wiz 30/PM 10, INT/CON based for lots of DR (if you take EDR 3) wich can be harder to kill.

LOL jk<br><br>In this type of build, you are a caster, so you want intelligence pumped for spell DC.  This means, you also would want to take spell foci feats.  If you have to tak 20 wiz, what about 20 pm too?  That is +2 ac better than 16!  LOL  <br><br>What i am trying to say is, with this build, bard may be a better option (can get tumble, dis, umd for those wonderful DIvine scrolls <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    i had to do it).  Why cant you take stills?  <br><br>you asked us to help you, but you havent really given us what you want.  A dedicated caster would use save spells.  the spells you list are really no-save spells (i know, but!) and are excellent for those mage-melee types.  You havent said why no armor.  What you want out of it.  Cuz, honestly, the monk, besides tumble, will not really give you the ac boost that fullplate and a tower will (that is +11 right there) nevermind the+10 from enchantments.  You would have to get your wisdom (on a intelligence based build) up to 30, or 18+12 from items to equal that!  lOL  it makes no sense to me to have 30 wisdom on a wiz build (it doesnt even make sense to me to have 30 wisdom on a cleric build!  ok, sometimes, but not the majority). <br><br>what i am trying to say is, what you ask isnt in line with what you really want.  TO max ac, you need full plate, tower, tumble 40, and anything else you can get.  Bard, with umd, gets you the monk boots, and all the other monk goodies SKILL WISE, without the negatives of smelling bad.  <br><br>just my 2 cents.<br><br>*edit: you said dex bonus too... so you really would need +10 from dex and +5 from wis with monk! K, fine.  BUT, you would now have to get +12 in dex, wis and intelligence.  IF your pw has +12 to stat items lyin around (and it doesnt cuz +5 is max you say), then something will suffer.  Again, back to why, when fp and tower make is soo much easier and more effective (remember, back stabbin looses you dodge ac, so all the dex ac is gone, where fp doesnt leave you - well... k i should never do this at 4:30 in the mornin).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 01/03/09 10:21</span></i></p>
