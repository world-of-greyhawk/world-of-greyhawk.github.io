What's the best AC and AB a dex based melee character can get? I'd like something with weaponmaster and fighter, so he can be viable in combat and be hard to hit.. and get Epic Dodge if at all possible.

Don't go to extreme Best AC and AB, because that would mean something like a halfing starting with 20 DEX, and the rest of your stats suffer from that.<br><br>Fighter8/Rogue13/WM19 sounds great, you might need that sneak to deal good damage.<br><br>As for numbers, AB around 50 and AC around 30 if I'm correct... but I don't count excessive stuff like starting with 20 DEX.
