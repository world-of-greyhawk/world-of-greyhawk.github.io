This is my first post of a build so please bear with me. It is a blend of my two favored classes, Blackguard and Rogue. There are other builds that use these classes but none with this level breakdown that I saw. It was an attempt to get the most out of the skills of each class, with rogue skills such as PP and Set Traps neglected. Set Traps could be useful for extra damage though. Also, the world I played this character on had a large number of undead and I was becoming frustrated with the damage output of my character, hence Divine Might.<br><br><b>Stalker In Shadows - Rogue(19), Blackguard(19), Shadowdancer(2)</b><br>Human, Any Evil<br>PvM, but PvP light capable, playable from 1-40<br><br>STR: 14<br>DEX: 14 (28)<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 10<br>CHA: 16 (18)<br><br>Hitpoints: 400<br>Skillpoints: 269<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 26/19/33<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Traps: +4<br>BAB: 27<br>AB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 37 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 29/32<br>Sneak Attack: 16d6<br>Attack Per Round: 4<br><br><b>SKILLS</b><br>Discipline 35(37), Hide 43(52), Listen 43(42), Move Silently 43(52), Taunt 35(39), Tumble 40(49), UMD 30(34)<br><br><br><b>LEVELING GUIDE</b><br>01: Rogue(1): Dodge, Mobility<br>02: Rogue(2): {Evasion}<br>03: Rogue(3): Weapon Finesse, {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>04: Rogue(4): DEX+1, (DEX=15)<br>05: Rogue(5)<br>06: Rogue(6): Power Attack<br>07: Rogue(7)<br>08: Rogue(8): DEX+1, (DEX=16)<br>09: Rogue(9): Cleave<br>10: Blackguard(1)<br>11: Blackguard(2): {Smite Good}<br>12: Blackguard(3): DEX+1, Weapon Focus: Rapier, (DEX=17)<br>13: Blackguard(4)<br>14: Blackguard(5)<br>15: Blackguard(6): Improved Critical: Rapier<br>16: Blackguard(7): DEX+1, (DEX=18)<br>17: Blackguard(8)<br>18: Blackguard(9): Divine Might<br>19: Blackguard(10)<br>20: Rogue(10): DEX+1, Improved Evasion, (DEX=19)<br>21: Shadowdancer(1): Great Dexterity I, {Hide in Plain Sight}, (DEX=20)<br>22: Shadowdancer(2): {Darkvision}<br>23: Rogue(11)<br>24: Rogue(12): DEX+1, Great Dexterity II, (DEX=22)<br>25: Rogue(13): Defensive Roll<br>26: Blackguard(11)<br>27: Blackguard(12): Divine Shield<br>28: Blackguard(13): DEX+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Rapier, (DEX=23)<br>29: Blackguard(14)<br>30: Blackguard(15): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=24)<br>31: Blackguard(16): Armor Skin<br>32: Blackguard(17): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br>33: Rogue(14): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=26)<br>34: Rogue(15)<br>35: Blackguard(18)<br>36: Rogue(16): CHA+1, Great Dexterity V, Epic Dodge, (DEX=27), (CHA=17)<br>37: Rogue(17)<br>38: Rogue(18)<br>39: Blackguard(19): Great Dexterity VI, Epic Prowess, (DEX=28)<br>40: Rogue(19): CHA+1, Crippling Strike, (CHA=18)<br><br><b>Known Weaknesses of build:</b><br>Only 269 skillpoints- For a rogue this seems low.

It's still passable, though.<br>No dual wield- That speaks for itself.<br>Low Saves- Adding Charisma gear will help some but the build doesn't have Slippery Mind.<br><br><b>Gear</b><br>You'll want to aim for charisma and dex gear for this character. You'll probably want to get usage out of UMD and get Improved Invis scrolls and Bless Weapon/Darkfire/Divine Favor/Holy Sword, Etc. Strength could be helpful in boosting base damage. Also, anything that helps raise Will Save would be nice.<br><br>This build could be done with an elf as well. You would lose 43 skill points, 40hp, and one feat but you would gain 1AB and 1AC. The character is already starved of skill points being a rogue in my opinion, though.<br><br>Any suggestions on this build?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By SablePhoenix on 06/17/07 06:53</span></i></p>

I would definetly go for more INT and earlier ED. Start with DEX 16 and CHA 14 to access ED earlier. I would also dump STR a little. I hate having only 10, but 14 only gives you better carrying capacity and little else. A bit playablitiy early on perhaps. But if you forego those +2 to damage you get 86 skillpoints. In a Rogue-heavy build, that's a no-brainer to me.<br><br>Cool combo, though.

Wow, thank you for a quick reply. I've been using the CBC for a while so the formatting was almost second nature.<br><br>I do have a question though. How would I qualify for the necessary Blackguard feats if I only take 10 strength? Doesn't Power Attack require at least 13 strength?<br><br>The suggestions for getting Epic Dodge sooner is a very good one. I'll have to adjust my build to account for that. <br><br>Thanks for taking the time to look!

That would solve the skills issue and only loose 1 to saves, Divine Might and Shield. Any other suggestions to improve this build?<br><br>I'm trying to figure out why I took a second level of Shadowdancer instead of another level of Blackguard for the HP. I think my reason had been based on a build before I had rogue and a 2nd level of Shadowdancer gave Uncanny Dodge. Hmm, maybe 20 levels of Blackguard would be better than 2 levels of shadowdancer.

As far as I can see, the difference on 2SD vs 20 BG  would be:<br><br>2SD: +4 skillpoints, Darkvision feat.<br><br>20BG: +2 hps, +1/4 BAB (but since you take SD in epic levels that dont make any difference right?), and one more boost to your fiend: +2 bonus Hit Dice, its natural armor increases by +2, and its Strength and Intelligence each increase by +1 (shamelessly copied from the nwnwiki).<br><br>Unless you play in a PW with alot of deep caves where you dont want light to kill your hide checks then I'd say 20BG levels would be better than 2SD levels since you allready get Evasion and Uncanny dodge from rogue levels.<br><br>I hope I'm not lying now, at least its not on purpose if I do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cerolill on 07/10/07 14:59</span></i></p>
