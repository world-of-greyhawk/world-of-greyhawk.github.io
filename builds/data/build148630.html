Years of monastic devotion coupled with rigorous arcane studies have molded this surprisingly versatile archer. He not only boasts a vicious arrow, but can easily confound all but the most powerful spellcasters with his beefy magical defenses, and can avoid melee battle with his tremendous speed. His greatest weakness, ironically, is to his fellow archer, but even there he can often shine with the aid of highly accurate crippling arrows. And though he generally frowns upon those who flee battle, the possibility is always within reach considering his speed.<br><br>Starting Stats (Ending Stats)<br>STR   10<br>DEX   20 (30)<br>CON   13 (14)<br>WIS   8<br>INT   12<br>CHA   8<br><br>1   Monk-Point Blank Shot<br>2   Monk-<br>3   Monk-Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>4   Monk-<br>5   Monk-<br>6   Monk-Toughness<br>7   Monk-<br>8   Monk-<br>9   Wizard-Rapid Shot<br>10  Arcane Archer-<br>11  Arcane Archer-<br>12  Arcane Archer-Improved Critical: Longbow<br>13  Arcane Archer-<br>14  Arcane Archer-<br>15  Arcane Archer-Blindfight<br>16  Arcane Archer-<br>17  Arcane Archer-<br>18  Arcane Archer-Called Shot<br>19  Arcane Archer-<br>20 Wizard-<br>21  Arcane Archer-Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>22  Arcane Archer-<br>23  Arcane Archer-<br>24  Arcane Archer-Armor Skin, Epic Prowess<br>25  Arcane Archer-<br>26  Arcane Archer-<br>27  Arcane Archer-Epic Fortitude<br>28  Arcane Archer-Great Dexterity I<br>29  Arcane Archer-<br>30  Monk-21+ Discipline, Epic Skill Focus: Discipline<br>31  Monk-<br>32  Monk-<br>33  Monk-Improved Spell Resistance I<br>34  Monk-<br>35  Monk-<br>36  Monk-Improved Spell Resistance II<br>37  Monk-Max Tumble<br>38  Wizard-40 Spellcraft<br>39  Monk-Improved Spell Resistance III<br>40  Monk-Max Discipline<br>If you used your skills for 40 Spellcraft, 40 Tumble and 43 Discipline, you have another 86 skill points to distribute.

With only 18 levels of monk is it really worth 3 epic feats to get +3 spell resistance?  I'd just leave it as it is and get great dex or blinding speed etc.  Either way you can only resist spells from low level mods or something like the undead lord(the build).

There are many many "spellsword" builds out there, and those few ranks make this build all the more effective against them. Lose that +6 SR and you'll only have 28, meaning that casters will need to be over 12 pure as opposed to 18 pure to begin penetrating (except on rolls of 1 of course. And at 19 you'd still only penetrate on rolls of 1, so really it starts at 20, which is the whole point). Those builds with 25 or less caster levels will land less than 1/5 of the time, as opposed to about 1/2. That can make or break you, and the point of this build was to have that kind of versatility.

I think he is trying to point out that most buildswith over 20 caster levels usually have 30-40. That being the case, those three feats may be better spent.

Wasnt it decided that BlindFight does not work with archery?<br><br>Being so hard to catch and all, why did you want Epic Skill Focus Discipline?  They have to catch you to knock you down. Or are you worried about spells?<br><br>As for replacing the Spell Resists; I'm about 50-50 on it. An alternative feat you might like; Blinding Speed (seems to go with the theme). <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    Also, given the strength of your fists with 18 levels of Monk, I wonder if maybe some feats to allow you to enter melee if required would be good (goes with the versatiity aspect).<br>_________________<br>Normal kids play rock-paper-scissors.<br>Shifter kids play IronGolem-RustMonster-MindFlayer. . .

Does blindfight really not work on archers? That's disappointing. You could replace that feat then I guess. And as far as discipline, I think it's always a good idea to have a high discipline, even if you can run away from most, if for no other reason than that sometimes you may not feel like running.<br>As far as blinding speed... you can take that if you like it, but I don't, because it doesn't last very long at all, and I consider temporary spells/skills worthless (the best reason being that people can run away, something which this build obviously takes advantage of). If you're on a server without haste items though, it would definitely be a good idea to trade at least one of those SR bonuses for it.<br>And there's the question of whether or not he should use his fists... I'd say it would be a bad idea. Even at close range he'll always be considerably superior with the bow. He won't have any damage bonus and will have considerably lower AB with his fists--and we're talking a good 10-15 points lower.

One thing I forgot in that last reply, and it goes back to the SR issue. Two things:<br>1. Some of the most powerful builds are spellswords, and having a good defense against _both_ of their forms of offense is a huge deal.<br>2. There are a good number of caster builds that take 29 pure and then go for a prestige class, one of the better examples being PM builds. Immune Critical can really hurt when combined with high AC and especially with a spell like premonition or even worse epic warding. But at least with the +6 SR, spells will penetrate 50% of the time instead of 80%. It makes a very noticeable difference.

I just realized I've been using the wrong math for Spell Resistance entirely.. I've been giving a roll in favor of the defender instead of the caster, which drastically reduces my expected effectiveness of SR. Also I gave +10 in favor of the caster... I'm not sure where the hell I got that from, but it's not right. So actually anything level 15 or higher can land, and something level 25 would land 50% of the time. Level 29 would land 70% of the time. With this in mind I would say definitely drop the 3 Spell Resistance feats in favor of something else. Probably Epic Reflexes, Epic Will, and something else.

You can try going for more monk levels. By taking more monk levels, it will increase your SR.<br><br>You gain spell resistance equal to your class level +10.<br><br>Right now, you have 18 monk levels, you will have 28 SR. But if you increased the amount of monk level. For example... 20, the SR now would be 30. Along with Spell Resistances, if you took three, that will farthur it to 36 SR.<br><br>However, it is not good idea to use Spell Resistance with this type of build.. You don't have enough monk level to take Spell Resistance. If you did Level 40 Monk, pure monk there is, you would be able to get 50 SR, then add in 10 SR, you will have 70 SR... extremely tough for the spell caster to defeat. But weak against melee.<br><br>Correct me if I am wrong about the SR above.<br><br>Anuis
