You need a +1 BAB to get Weapon Focus which a first level Wizard doesn't have.<br><br>Perhaps you're suppose to start as a Paladin on level 1?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Anguishedcry on 03/27/06 17:31</span></i></p>

Your approach is interesting and everything - I'd never think of making an intelligent Divine warrior.<br><br>One problem with this build is the lack of stats synergy, since you need both high int and cha. The obvious thing here would be to use sorcerer as caster class. You compensate to some degree by getting lots of feats (CoT &amp; Wizard) and taking 2x great int as wizard feat in epics. A high int let you take more skills as well.<br><br>The last Paladin lvl let you max taunt. I would consider one more Wizard lvl here to make your spells harder to dispell, give better penetration and get one more feat.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

He's not undispellable by Mord's.<br><br>Mord's has two effects:<br>1) An improved "Breach" effect that can affect both single targets and groups. This works against a specified list of defensive spells.<br>2) A "Dispel Magic" effect with a 1d20 roll + 1/lvl up to +20 modifier, that can target a singel target or a group.<br>The DC to beat with the "Dispell" part is 11 + Level of the caster that made the spells you want to dispell.<br><br>You will be undispellable by Mord's if you have 30 caster levels.<br>You can still be "breached" by Mord's and the other Breach spells.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 03/29/06 12:13</span></i></p>

Indeed, I said he's undispellable, except for Mord's, did I not <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif"><br>_________________<br>"Ever notice how wizards think all life in the Realms dances on their hands and lasts from day to day only because they work constantly to keep us all alive?

Did I say you didn't say it??? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>Correction: With the 1.66 patch the +20 cap of Mord's was lifted andyou're no longer safe at lvl 30, so you can do one out of two.<br><br>1) Go as high lvl as you can to be able to avoid as many dispell attempts by Mord's as possible.<br>2) In a multiclass build - Stop at lvl 25 so you're at least immune to Greater Dispelling.<br><br>My suggestion is in line with 1) The build as it stands is in line with 2)<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 03/29/06 12:58</span></i></p>
