Druid/Monk/SD combo would be a good PP.<br><br>Druid because of Camouflage and One with Land bonuses.<br>Monk for speed during hide movement and Wisdom ac bonus.<br>SD gives you PP skill too.<br><br><br>So, you could take Druid to lvl 20 and be an Elder Air Elemental Pickpocket with insane Monk speed and AC.  Elder Air Elementals get 30 Dex by default, so you can dump your stat points into wisdom/int/cha instead.<br><br><br>You can take SD at intervals to max out your PP skill along the way (not sure if this is a straigth lvl 40 build or a playable build.)<br><br>One thing to remember if you are thinking of going into a shape is the fact that only your Armor bonuses will transfer (for Elemental shapes).  Chest/Helm/Shield only.  So rogue gloves will be useless, rings etc...<br><br><br>Elementals will also give you the wonderfull crit/sneak/mind affecting/poison/paralysis immunities as well.<br><br>You can disarm traps while shifted but you can't set while in a form.<br><br>So, just thought you might want to try out that type of build.<br><br>A fast Dire Badger sneaker is fun too.  hahaha

A bard 30 shadowdancer 10 can self buff skills with bardsong, reaching a pretty disgusting song at level 30 with an item modified perform of 100. That should probably help get your pick on.
