I need a good level 30 blackguard build for a PW server that is capped at 30. I think probably the base class would be fighter or cleric, since they are usually the best for blackguards. <br><br>I am restricted by a few server rules, however: 1. No DEV crit. 2. You must have at least 5 levels in any class you multiclass to by level 30. 3. Level cap is set to 30, as I already mentioned. 4. You cannot multi to a class that has different alignment requirements. So, for example, I cannot take paladin levels because paladins are LG and BGs are evil.<br><br>Also, because of my character's subrace, he gets +4 constitution, but this done with a permanent magical strength buff rather than directly modifying his base ability scores. The world I am playing on is moderate to high magic, but not over the top. I have seen a few good BG builds, but I cannot figure out how to adapt them to these server rules. Can anyone here please help me?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By OMGZERGRUSHWTF on 04/17/05 01:09</span></i></p>

Well, for level 30 you could also have bard 10 rdd 10 BG 10.  <br><br>Level distribution pre epic should be bard 8 rdd 8 BG 4, this will get you 4 attacks/round, very good saving throws (bard high saves are reflex and will, rdd high saves are fortitude and will).  Since you have a permanant +4 constitution, you should be able to pump charisma and strength a bit.  There is a fair bit of synergy with the charisma use.  Bard song, divine might, divine shield, stilled improved invisibility, 2 castings of bulls str (which stack) should make a quite effective dark knight.

My only problem with the above is that the server I am playing on somewhat of an RP server, and the notion of a singing warrior of ultimate death and destruction <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  is kind of ridiculous.

Yep...<br><br>Its a bit difficult to justify in roleplaying terms, even if you are trying to attempt a "blackguard of tiamat" or somesuch.<br><br>But, it is a strong level 30 blackguard build.

Dexer monk10/SD18/BG12 has good saves, AB, epic dodge and selfconceal, 10 sneak attacks if dual weilding, hasted and flurrying, a great AC and lots of defensive powers and immunities from monk and SD levels. And monkspeed never gets old.

Details, details. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br>A monk 10/BG 12/SD 8 might be nice then. You'd have to get a mage buddy or a concealment item to replace the missing selfconceal 5. Still a pretty tough banana with a high AC, epic dodge and a helpful set of meatshield summons for you to get your sneak on. The death knight is even nice enough to drop a dispel on your foe before closing in.
