I would be grateful for any comments anyone has on this build as it is similar to one I am planning (without Dev. Crit). I would also like to know about rearranging the Cleric levels, so I get them sooner. If possible, without ruining BAB, I'd also like to try and fit in more pre-epic Cleric levels as I'd really rather not wait until Epic levels before I can resurrect anyone. The PW I play on has an effective level cap of 30ish (there is no level cap but there are very, very few characters above level 30), so I want to try and get the most out of this before then.<br>_________________<br>Thanks for the thesaurus you gave me, it makes me not write the same words over and over and over again

Yeah, I found that after I posted here and it does seem more appropriate.

I'd be tempted just to go straight up Paladin or Cleric, and then adding a few levels of something else to give him an edge.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;It's a shame most of the builds that turn up with Paladin in them only have 1-4 levels.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->There should be quite a few heavy Paladin builds that show up.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I'm thinking it must have been a bug of some sort because the first search I did of builds with 1-40 each of Pal/CoT/Cleric only gave me about 7 results, and this was the only one with more than 10 levels of Paladin. After doing a search with only Paladin as the search item it worked. And, about the large number of builds with low levels of Paladin, according to the search engine more than a quarter of builds with Paladin in them have only 1-5 levels (56/200), I guess the Paladin Immunities are attractive to some.<br><br>Anyway... What can be said about this build? There are a lot of builds I have found using the search engine have had no comments so it is hard to figure out if they're worth playing. I think I'll base my build more closely on Cinnabar's, but I'm still curious abut this one.<br>_________________<br>N.O.M.A.N.<br>National Organisation of Matrimonial Attorneys Nationwide<br><br>"Let N.O.M.A.N. put asunder"

You dont really get the full effect of a Cleric or a Paladin. Cleric loses out on a lot of spell casting power. Paladin doesnt get to take advantage of the smiting ability or longer durations of divine might/shield. With this build, most people dont build with Dev. Crit. in mind anymore. I cant really offer a lot of advice with the build. I like the Paladin/Fighter/CoT split myself.
