I've been playing a Sorc 27 / COT 10 / Rogue 3, on a server for a few weeks now and its pretty well balanced. The server I play on, need you to have a ton of hit points. Full Items Im at 840, which is pretty good. Some mages are 1062, but im going for more balance. I need some ideas and opinions on my build. I dont see anything like it here, so any ideas would be great. (Please stay within these classes and not the sorcerer 29 pally 1, thing either).<br><br>Class progression:<br>-   Rogue 1<br>-   Sorc 2-22<br>-   Cot 23-33 (gets me five extra feats. DR 1,2,3 are taken)<br>-   rogue 34<br>-   socr 35-39<br>-   rogue 40<br><br>Max, extend and empower are all taken. <br>Other than that.. UMD, Con, Spell and lore are up'd, might want to do open lock and not much tumble...<br><br>Opinions?<br><br>Thx CA<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.dladventures.com/" target="_blank">DLA</a> <br>I was baptized with the Holy Spirit when I took Him by simple faith in the Word of God....

Do you get epic warding?  That's worth a lot of defense.<br><br>Without a full build it's harder to comment I'm afraid.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
