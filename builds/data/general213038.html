I've tried a template for both without Dev crit and they both end up very similar. Thing is, which do you think is worth more? The +5 to all saves from CoT (I don't think the fighter template can hold a finger to the CoT with regards to the ref save but then again, neither gets Evasion but with an item that gives the feat...) and weak pally-like abilities or the +6 damage from Epic Weapon Spec and possibly slightly more feats? BTW I took exotic for the CoT and used weapon focus scythe to qualifu as it isn't that much worse/better than a great sword and would allow him to get all weapon profs. I don't think I'll post it; these have been done ad nauseum but I was wondering what you think is worth more.

If you don't absolutely need that extra feat you get with the FTR, then I'd say go with CoT. The loss of WS and EWS isn't going to hurt all that much with an extremely high STR build like the RDD builds tend to be. And +5 to all your saves (along with the boost to Reflex saves if you take CoT pre-epic) is nothing to sneeze at.<br><br>The drawback with CoT is you have to be non-evil (not generally a big deal), you must focus in a melee weapon before taking the class (which means burning a feat on Martial/Exotic or focussing in the less-than-palatable Bard selection), and you have to wait until your BAB is +7 (at least 10 levels in the Bard/RDD/CoT template). But there are definite advantages.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I figured it's actually two to three feats less for taking Heavy Armor prof and possibly waste a feat on focus on a weapon you don't want to use or a wasted proficiency (but IMO, scythe is cooler and with UMD/all weapon and armor profs, you can basically use everything you can get your hands on) but the fighter would need to use two on WS and EWS anyhow.<br><br>But, how much more survivable will the +5 to saves make the char?

depends on the PW I guess. From my experience it is purely the makeup of the character/ build that guides it down one path or another. <br><br>With Fighter you get an extra feat and Wpn Spec and Epic Wpn Spec. <br><br>With COT you get higher saves and no Spec, but you can open up Divine Wrath of course.<br><br>Preference only I find.<br><br>NB. A lot of PWs restrict to only one Prestige Class per build, not all mind you.

I guess you could always opt for Cat's Grace (when the Bard gets it) and stick with medium armor. I think your worst case scenario is only 1 AC less than plate.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;But, how much more survivable will the +5 to saves make the char?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Depends on where you're playing. I'm a saving throw junkie though, so be warned I'm biased. I think it would make your character much more survivable, especially if you get those CoT levels in early on in the build. Boosted saves are great, but boosted saves at early levels are awesome.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Fighter, the Bard song gives you bonus saving throws as do various Bard spells.
