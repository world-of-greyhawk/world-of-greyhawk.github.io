<b>The Arcane Archer</b><br><br>The Arcane Archer (AA) prestige class is one of my favourite classes.  Thanks to the Enchant arrow feat, it can get the highest AB in the game. But it also allows characters with focus on the arcane caster part of the build to get a reasonable AB. This allows flexibility and a wide range of build concepts, making it a viable class option for many different character ideas.<br>Most AA’s are primarily archers with focus on ranged combat. But some are arcane casters with ranged physical attacks as an added option. The class can also be used to give characters that are primarily strength based melee fighters a better ranged AB.<br><br><br>Hit Die: d8<br>Proficiencies: Armor (Light, Medium), Shields, Weapons ( Martial,Simple)<br>Skill Points: 4 + INT Mod<br>Skills: Craft Armor, Craft Trap, Craft Weapon, Heal, Hide,Listen, Lore, Move Silently, Spot<br>Primary Saving Throw(s): Fortitude, Reflex<br>Primary Ability: Dexterity<br><br><b>Prestige class Requirements</b>:<br>Base Attack Bonus: +6<br>Feats: Weapon Focus (Longbow or Shortbow), Point Blank Shot<br>Race: Elf or Half-elf<br>Spellcasting: Ability to cast arcane spells ( Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)<br><br><b>Special Abilities &amp; Feats</b>:<br>Level 1 Enchant Arrow I<br>Level 2 Imbue Arrow<br>Level 3 Enchant Arrow II<br>Level 4 Seeker Arrow I<br>Level 5 Enchant Arrow III<br>Level 6 Seeker Arrow II<br>Level 7 Enchant Arrow IV<br>Level 8 Hail of Arrows<br>Level 9 Enchant Arrow V<br>Level 10 Arrow of Death<br>Level 11 Enchant Arrow VI<br>Level 13 Enchant Arrow VII<br>Level 15 Enchant Arrow VIII<br>Level 17 Enchant Arrow IX<br>Level 19 Enchant Arrow X<br>Level 21 Enchant Arrow XI<br>Level 23 Enchant Arrow XII<br>Level 25 Enchant Arrow XIII<br>Level 27 Enchant Arrow IV<br>Level 29 Enchant Arrow XV<br><br><b>Enchant Arrow I-XV</b><br>Type of Feat: Class<br>Prerequisite: Arcane Archer 1<br>Specifics: With this feat, every non-magical arrow the character nocks and lets fly gets a +1 enchantment bonus. The bonus only works for the Arcane Archer. For every 2 levels of Arcane Archer past 1st, the enchantment goes up by +1.<br>Use: Automatic<br><br><b>Imbue Arrow</b><br>Type of Feat: Class<br>Prerequisite: Arcane Archer 2<br>Specifics: The character gains the ability to summon a magical arrow and fire it at an enemy.

This arrow is magically created at the moment the character uses this ability.<br>Use: Selected<br><br><b>Hail of Arrows</b><br>Type of Feat: Class<br>Prerequisite: Arcane Archer 8<br>Specifics: In lieu of a regular attack, 1x/day the character can fire an arrow at each and every target within range, to a maximum of 1 target for every Arcane Archer level he has.<br>Use: Selected<br><br><b>Arrow of Death</b><br>Type of Feat: Class<br>Prerequisite: Arcane Archer 10<br>Specifics: At 10th level, the character can enchant an arrow 1x/day that forces a target, if damaged by the arrow, to make a Fortitude save or be slain.<br>Use: Combat<br><br><br><b>Epic Arcane Archer</b><br>Hit Die: d8<br>Skill Points: 4 + INT Mod<br>Bonus Feats: at level 14, 18, 22, 26, 30<br>Epic Bonus Feats: Devastating Critical (longbow, shortbow), Epic Prowess, Epic Reflexes, Epic Toughness, Epic Weapon Focus (longbow, shortbow), Great Dexterity, Improved Combat Casting, Overwhelming Critical (longbow, shortbow)<br><br><b>What race to choose</b><br><br><b>Elf</b> <br>Pros: Racial Dex bonus, racial weapon proficiency bows, keen senses, slightly better skill bonuses<br>Cons: Racial Con penalty, multiclass xp penalties (only wizard as favoured class)<br><br><b>Half elf</b><br>Pros: No xp penalty when multiclassing basic classes (favoured class - any)<br>Cons: No proficiency with bows – you can’t take the required weapon focus feat to qualify for AA before you have learnt to use bows.<br><br><b>The different caster classes</b><br><br><b>Wizard</b><br>Wizard has Int as primary ability. This stat has extra synergy with skills. Higher Int gives you bonus to several skills and extra skillpoints to play with. If you want high Int in the first place to be able to get more and better skills, then wizard may be a good option as caster class.<br>Wizards can learn far more spells than sorcerers. This is especially important at low levels, when the sorcerer’s selection is very limited. This is often the case for multiclassed casters like the AA. Wizards also get access to the spells one level earlier. Wizards get metamagical bonus feats, and scribe scroll as free feat at first level.<br>Wizards follow the lowest AB progression table. This can become a problem if you take many levels of wizard before lvl 20. Wizards get a Familiar that is strong early on, but will be too weak for combat in a high level multiclassed build. The familiar can have useful skills, like the pixie, and it can be fun to use as part of roleplay.<br><br><b>Specialist wizard</b><br>You can’t learn or cast spells from the opposite school. You get one more spell slot at each spell level. Illusion is often preferred here since few AAs will be any successful as enchanters.<br><br><b>Sorcerer</b><br>You have Cha as primary ability. It doesn’t give you much synergy, unless you want to add divine, Cha based feats to the mix. The sorcerer has a very limited number of known spells, especially at low levels, which is often the case with AA builds. But the spells you know, you can cast repeatedly. So if you don’t need many spells, and want to cast them often, this may be for you.<br>Sorcerers can qualify for the RDD prestige class which can be useful in some AA builds.<br>Sorcerers follow the lowest AB progression table. This can become a problem if you take many levels of sorcerer before lvl 20. Sorcerers get a Familiar that is strong early on, but will be too weak for combat in a high level multiclassed build. The familiar can have useful skills, like the pixie, and it can be fun to use as part of roleplay.<br><br><b>Bard</b><br>The bard’s spellcasting has Cha as primary ability. There is not much synergy here, unless you multiclass with divine classes that use Cha based feats.<br>Bard has a better AB progression than wizard and sorcerer. As a pure single class, bard will qualify much earlier for AA, because of the AB requirement. A Bard/AA can have BAB +17, and 4 attacks per round at lvl 20 whereas a pure sorcerer/AA or wizard/AA can get no more than BAB +14 and 3 attacks per round. This gives the bard builds greater flexibility when deciding what third class to take (if any) and when to add it.<br>There is a greater chance that the caster class becomes a substantial part of the build if you choose bard (I counted the listed builds), so the spellcasting abilities become important. Many of the bard spells are good for “fighter mages”<br>Bard has a fine selection of class skills that fits many different build types.<br>The Bard Song can be useful, also for an archer.<br>Bard can qualify for the RDD prestige class which can be useful in some AA builds.<br><br><b>What the stats do for the archer</b><br><br><b>Dexterity</b> gives both higher AB and AC. In other words, it makes it is easier for you to hit others and harder for others to hit you. Most archers want as high Dex as possible. You will need Uncanny Dodge to get the best effect of the Dex based AC. Dex gives bonus to skills like Hide, Move Silently and Tumble. It also gives bonus to reflex saves. A high Dex can give access to epic feats like Blinding Speed and Epic Dodge.<br><b>Strength</b> improves the damage you do with mighty bows. In some builds it can be used to qualify for epic feats like Devastating Critical.<br><b>Wisdom</b> can be used to determine the AB of ranged attacks if you take the Zen Archery feat. This can give synergy in monk builds,where Wis gives extra AC, and in Cleric or Druid builds, where Wis is the primary ability for divine spellcasting. Wis gives bonus to the will saves and to the heal, listen and spot skills.<br><b>Charisma</b> can be used with the Divine Might feat to add divine damage to your arrows. You will need a class with Turn Undead in the build. Cha is also important for bard and sorcerer spellcasting.<br><b>Intelligence</b> is important for wizard spellcasting. It gives bonus to skills like lore, search and spellcraft and gives bonus skillpoints to spend at each level up.<br><b>Constitution</b> gives a bonus to hitpoints, the concentration skill and the fortitude saves. It is more important for melee characters than for ranged attackers.<br><br><b>Multiclass options</b><br><br>AA can not be multiclassed with Shifter and Dwarven Defender.<br>I used pulse cap’s search engine to find the different AA builds listed in the “Indexed list of builds” (early jan 06). <br><b>Wizard/AA</b> was multiclassed with Monk (14 listed builds), Rogue (9), Fighter (7), Cleric (7), Druid (2), Pale Master (1), Ranger (1) and Shadowdancer (1)<br><b>Sorcerer/AA</b> was multiclassed with Paladin (3), RDD (1) and Cleric (1)<br><b>Bard/AA</b> was multiclassed with RDD (7), Shadowdancer (6), Rogue (4), Cleric (3), Pale Master (3), Weapon Master (2), Paladin (2), Barbarian (2), Assassin (2), Fighter (2), Champion of Torm (1), Blackguard (1), Monk (1) and Harper Scout (1)<br>So as you can see every possible third class was represented in one way or the other<br><br><b>The ideas behind the different third classes</b><br>These are the ideas I saw used when I looked through the builds from the search<br><b>Barbarian</b> – Uncanny Dodge for Dex builds, 10% faster movement, rage bonus to Str, Con and will, Terrifying rage <br><b>Cleric</b> – Zen Archery, Divine Might/Shield, very good buffing spells, Zen Archery for ranged AB with Str for melee AB<br><b>Druid</b> – Zen Archery coupled with Owls Insight spell for ranged attacks, Wild/Elemental/Dragon Shape for melee, good buffs, Animal Companion<br><b>Fighter</b> – Feats, Weapon specialization, AA to improve ranged AB in Str based melee builds<br><b>Monk</b> – Monk speed, bonus combat feats, 3 primary saving throws, evasion, skill selection, zen archer with Wis AC bonus<br><b>Paladin</b> – Divine Might/Shield, save bonus from Cha, fearless<br><b>Ranger</b> – Skills, Dual Wield, Favoured enemies, Ranger spells (Cat’s), Animal Companion<br><b>Rogue</b> – Skills, UMD, Sneak attack, Traps (stun and shoot), Uncanny Dodge, Evasion, Epic Dodge, SC<br><b>Assassin</b> – UMD, Uncanny Dodge, Death attack, Improved invisibility, Great Dex as epic bonus feat<br><b>Blackguard</b> – Sneak attack, Divine Might, save bonus from Cha, Bull’s from special ability stacks with Bull’s from spell<br><b>Champion of Torm</b> – Feats, improved saves, AA to improve ranged AB in Str based melee builds<br><b>Harper Scout</b> – Cat’s from special ability stacks with Cat’s from spell<br><b>Pale Master</b> – high AC, immune to critical hits, Epic spells<br><b>Red Dragon Disciple</b> – bonus to stats, especially to Str for Mighty bows and Devastating critical, AA to improve ranged AB in Str based melee builds<br><b>Shadowdancer</b> – HIPS, Uncanny Dodge, Evasion, Epic Dodge, SC, defensive shadow feats<br><b>Weapon Master</b> – better melee AB and damage<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 01/18/06 15:18</span></i></p>

You wouldn't mind posting what determines the damage and save DC of the fireball arrow f.ex.? And the Save DC for the Death Arrow. I believe that last is a set DC, but I wouldn't know.... I'll delete my post after that.
