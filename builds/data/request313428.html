I am wanting to make a pure druid build to play through OC and then take it to lvl 40 (suggestions on mods an/or suitable PWs to do that are welcome).

Feat wise, you don't have Blind Fight.  That's needed.  I'd drop Luck of Heroes for Expertise and drop Improved Initiative for Toughness.  Switch Superior Initiative with Epic Prowess.

Well, my first suggestion would be to clean your build spread, please don't write the innate class bonuses on every level.

I mean, without Monk, even though the shifts are good, spells are your biggest power by far, given your AC won't be anything amazing as a pure Druid. You say you don't want Necromancy, and that's ok, since Druids get close to no Necromancy spells, but you're definitely strongest at Conjuration and Evocation, just check your spellbook. Besides from Druids having very few, abjuration spells have no need and get no real benefit from having Spell Focus, so I'll repeat what I said in my guide: take Conjuration, you'll like it.<br><br>Now, taking Spell Focus in non-abjuration schools doesn't mean you're not RPing well, it means your character got brains.

I think you really need dragon shape in this build.  You dont get 30 wis until LATE anyway, so taking it then is very normal and natural, in my view.  WIthout it, i dont know if i would consider this a pure druid build as druids are all about shifting, esp since you are limiting spells.

Well, I don't like to get "in reality" when discussing a game, but the way I envision it (still not reality) is more or less that you made further studies in a certain school.

Druids cannot ever be lawful good!  I think you should read alot of Thax' posts here to get an idea of what a druid would be like.  In my mind, he opitimizes the druid!  One moment he's your best friend and is great to talk with.  The next, he's ripping at the heart of someone who looked at him cock-eyed!  A pure druid!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; -- Posted by Kail Pendragon  <br><br>Being hyperbolic is an integral part of Avado's being <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

You need to stop paying so much attention to avado, he knows Clerics well, but he's messing up Druids right now, better take what Magical Master says.<br> <br>Shifts have unarmed as their base weapon, all of them, so Improved Critical: unarmed works, avado was wrong, period. What doesn't work is Weapon Focus, Epic Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, Epic Weapon Specialization and Devastating Critical, though Overwhelming Critical does work if I remember correctly. So not worth it.<br><br>I've played non-shifter Druids, they're perfectly good casters, healers, summoners and buffers (all at the same time) so ignore avado again.<br><br>You only focus on full-time shifting when you take a Monk level, otherwise, it's not reliable enough, and your offensive spells will outmatch your melee on most cases, needless to repeat, avado is just wrong. 14 CON is perfectly fine, you need HP and Concentration checks when casting spells but CHA is usless on a pure Druid. It is true that your base CON is lost when shifted, but as I said, a non-Monk Druid won't work as a full time shifter. You do use shifts, but don't bet on them for everything.<br><br>The thing about Epic Spells is that the only worthwhile ones as far as I see it are Epic Warding and Epic Mage Armor, none of which can be taken by a Druid.<br><br>Dodge, Mobility and Spring Attack are useless, some metamagics are way better. I like Empower, Silent and Maximized, but you take whatever you like.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 11/11/09 05:10</span></i></p>

Hi guys. After a careful consideration I have change my build (again). She remains a <b>caster </b> type but instead of abjuration spells she will focus on <b> evocation</b>. I didn't pick conjuration because where she is from conjurers are distrusted (however she will still use the spells - unlike necromancy that she will not use).<br>Her stats:<br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 16 (32)<br>INT: 12<br>CHA: 14<br>She will drop: Expertise, Improved Expertise, Extend Spell and Brew Potion for<br>Spell Focus: Evocation, Greater Spell Focus: Evocation, Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Penetration<br>and in epics instead of few Great Wisdom feats she will get<br>Epic Spell Focus: Evocation, Epic Spell Penetration, Hellball and Greater Ruin<br><br>What is better skill Heal or Lore? I'd picked Lore because she can Heal herself but may be I am wrong?<br><br>With the feats I know nobody here recommended spell penetration feats so I wonder why. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">  Please if those are useless let me know.<br><br>Thanks for your patience.<br>_________________<br>Only when we know little do we know anything; doubt grows with knowledge.<br>- (Johann Wolfgang von Goethe)

However, they can be fun to play with and the difference (considering you're a druid versus a mage or cleric) won't be significant.  This also isn't a level 40 build for a server.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;What is better skill Heal or Lore?

Better choices may involve Mummy Dust or Dragon Knight, both of which are good meat shields with a fear aura.

I have no experience with epic spells and picked those two solely for RP reasons.
