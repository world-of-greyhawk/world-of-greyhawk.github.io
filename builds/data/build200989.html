<b>Playable from levels 1-40...PvM</b><br><br>With a new pirate based module, I thought I would release a rapier and dagger swashbuckling weapon master.  This character is a strictly RP (read not min/maxed, severely deficient) attempt to create a rapier and dagger weapon master.  I wouldn't try to play this character in any setting outside of a primarily RP one, as pretty much any character could wipe the floor with this one.  Honestly though, it does hold its own in a one on one fight against other melee builds (non dev. crit. setting).  It does succeed in getting a high AB, focusing in both a rapier and dagger, and getting all the combat feats and skills an expert fencer should have.  For feats, one would expect a fencer to know the knockdown and disarm techniques as well as expertise, which he has.  For skills, he has a high discipline and concentration (which any focused warrior should have), parry (not a useful skill, but could he call himself a master fencer without it?) he has tumble (acrobatic grace, for swinging from the occasional chandelier) and taunt (Psychological warfare is a must for a weapon master, it also fits the swashbuckling personality).<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-High AB while dual wielding. A 45 AB while dual wielding is very good.<br>-High critical threat range. He has a 13-20 threat range with a mundane Rapier and an X3 multiplier with that weapon. He's not bad with a dagger either (15-20 x3).  Against enemies who are vulnerable to critical hits, he does a good deal of damage.<br>-Fair AC.  It could be better, but it's okay.  Unfortunately he doesn't have uncanny dodge.<br>-Improved Knockdown and Improved Disarm.  Good abilities for taking an opponent out of a fight.<br>-A high Taunt Skill.  Against opponents who haven't maxed their concentration he can lower their AC by upto 6 points.<br>-A high Parry Skill.  In a one on one fight, this skill can be useful, but it is pretty pointless otherwise.<br><br><i>Disadvanges</i><br><br>-Mediocre hitpoints.  For a melee character, 476 is kind of low.<br>-Low Saves. Pretty much any spell or anything requiring a save will get this character.<br>-Melee is his only form of attack.  If he can't damage an opponent with his weapons he can't hurt them. <br>-Low Damage.  Weapon specialization helps a little, but he doesn't do well against opponents who are immune to critical hits or have damage reduction.<br><br><b>Master Fencer</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Human<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Any<br><br><i>Base Attribute</i><br>STR 14   <br>DEX 16<br>CON 14 <br>WIS 8<br>INT 14 <br>CHA 10 <br><br><i>Leveling Guide</i><br>Levels 1-12 Fighter<br>Levels 13-31 Weapon Master<br>Levels 32-39 Fighter<br>Level 40 Bard<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Bard 1<br>Fighter 20<br>Weapon Master 19<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>All 10 go to Dexterity<br><br><i>Feats</i><br>Level 1: Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus (Dagger), Weapon Focus (Rapier)<br>Level 2: Expertise<br>Level 3: Dodge<br>Level 4: Weapon Specialization (Rapier)<br>Level 6: Weapon Specialization (Dagger), Mobility<br>Level 8: Spring Attack<br>Level 9: Whirlwind Attack <br>Level 10: Ambidexterity<br>Level 12: Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>Level 15: Improved Critical (Dagger)<br>Level 18: Improved Critical (Rapier)<br>Level 21: Knockdown<br>Level 24: Improved Knockdown <br>Level 25: Weapon of Choice (Dagger)<br>Level 27: Disarm<br>Level 28: Epic Weapon Focus (Rapier)<br>Level 30: Improved Disarm<br>Level 31: Epic Weapon Focus (Dagger)<br>Level 33: Blind-Fight, Epic Weapon Specialization (Rapier)<br>Level 35: Epic Weapon Specialization (Dagger)<br>Level 36: Great Dexterity I<br>Level 37: Epic Prowess<br>Level 39: Great Dexterity II, Armor Skin<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 14<br>DEX 28<br>CON 14<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 10<br><br><i>Final Saves </i><br>Fortitude 22<br>Reflexes 29<br>Will 15<br><br><i>AB and Damage</i><br><br>(No buffs, normal Rapier and Dagger)<br>45/40/35/30 8+1D6 (13-20 x3)<br>45/40 7+1D4 (15-20 x3)<br><br>(+12 to Dexterity, +5 keen Rapier, +5 keen Dagger)<br>45/40/35/30 13+1D6 (10-20 x3)<br>45/40 12+1D4 (13-20 x3) <br><br>Maximum AB: 73 (71 while dual wielding)<br><br><i>AC</i> <br>29 (30) (Robes)<br>32 (33) (Robes and Tower Shield)<br>54 (55) (+12 to Dex, +5 Robes, +5 Ring of Protection, +5 Amulet of Natural Armor, Boots of Speed)<br>62 (63) (As above, but with +5 Tower Shield)<br><br><i>Hit Points</i> 476 (Max Every Level)<br> <br><i>Final Skillpoints</i> 217<br>Concentration 40 (42)<br>Discipline 43 (45) <br>Intimidate 4 (4)<br>Parry 43 (52)<br>Taunt 43 (43)<br>Tumble 40 (49)<br><br><br><i>Skillpoint Distribution</i><br>Level 1: Concentration 4, Discipline 4, Intimidate 2, Parry 4, Save 4<br>Level 2: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Parry 1, Save 6<br>Level 3: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Intimidate 1, Parry 1, Save 6 <br>Level 4: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Parry 1, Save 8<br>Level 5: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Intimidate 1, Parry 1, Save 8<br>Level 6: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Parry 1, Save 10<br>Level 7: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Parry 1, Save 12<br>Level 8: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Parry 1, Save 14<br>Level 9: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Parry 1, Save 16<br>Level 10: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Parry 1, Save 18<br>Level 11: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Parry 1, Save 20<br>Level 12: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Parry 1, Save 22<br>Level 13: Discipline 1, Save 26<br>Level 14: Discipline 1, Save 30<br>Level 15: Discipline 1, Save 34<br>Level 16: Discipline 1, Save 38<br>Level 17: Discipline 1, Save 42<br>Level 18: Discipline 1, Save 46<br>Level 19: Discipline 1, Save 50<br>Level 20: Discipline 1, Save 54<br>Level 21: Discipline 1, Save 58<br>Level 22: Discipline 1, Save 62 <br>Level 23: Discipline 1, Save 66<br>Level 24: Discipline 1, Save 70<br>Level 25: Discipline 1, Save 74<br>Level 26: Discipline 1, Save 78<br>Level 27: Discipline 1, Save 82<br>Level 28: Discipline 1, Save 86<br>Level 29: Discipline 1, Save 90<br>Level 30: Discipline 1, Save 94<br>Level 31: Discipline 1, Save 98<br>Level 32: Concentration 20, Discipline 1, Parry 20, Save 62<br>Level 33: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Parry 1, Save 64<br>Level 34: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Parry 1, Save 66<br>Level 35: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Parry 1, Save 68<br>Level 36: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Parry 1, Save 70<br>Level 37: Concentration 1, Discipline 1, Parry 1, Save 72<br>Level 38: Discipline 1, Parry 1, Save 75<br>Level 39: Discipline 1, Parry 1, Save 78<br>Level 40: Discipline 1, Parry 1, Taunt 43, Tumble 40<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Personally I would prefer to go fighter/rogue/wm or fighter/SD/weapon master<br><br>Evasion/improved evasion benefit from high DEX<br>Uncanny Dodge allows you to keep your (considerable) DEX AC if caught flatfooted.<br>Epic Dodge is a must for an epic DEX build if you can qualify.<br>Sneak attack (rogue only) helps out quite a bit especially if you combine with knockdown.<br><br>Bard adds a place to dump your skill points on the last level of the build IMO. If you drop 10 levels of fighter from this and take shadowdancer for example you lose 5 fighter bonus feats, you gain<br>Uncanny Dodge<br>Evasion<br>Improved Evasion<br>Slippery Mind <br>Defensive Roll<br><br>And most importantly qualify for Epic Dodge. So although you lose feats , you do gain a few useful ones and you are able to keep your tumble maxed throughout your build.<br><br>Anyway, just my thoughts.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

I'm trying out a Fighter/Rogue/Bard since I felt Epic Dodge and Taunt were both appropriate for a Swashbuckler. Worse damage and AB than your build and sucks against Crit/Sneak Immune foes but fun to play.<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.
