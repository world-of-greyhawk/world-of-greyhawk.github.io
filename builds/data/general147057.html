Ok master builders, I've got a special build request.  I'm interested in making an Iron Golem character (epic Construct Shape feat).  I'm interested in your views on how this build should progress, and what feats to take.<br><br>I want to focus on the Construct Shape, ie: don't suggest I take Dragon instead, or anything like that.<br><br>How much Druid lvls should be taken vs Shifter lvls, pros and cons, Monk or no Monk thrown in, etc...<br><br><br>This character will be for a PW and will be played as he progresses up in lvls, not just slapped with a bazzilion xp to instantly be lvl 40.<br><br>This PW does not have uber magic gear, so a build that stands on it's own would be nice.<br><br>Thanks in advance.

Check out my Construct Shifter build in the build list.  <br><br>The only problem I encountered with the build as it stands is some XP penalty at higher levels (which can be countered with some changes in level allocation) and some low damage due to being a small character.  When you get Construct Shape, that's less of a problem -- but getting there will be more difficult.  You can easily start as a different race though.<br>_________________<br>-------------------------------<br>"What do you fear most in the world?"<br>"The possibility that love is not enough."<br>-- Major Garland Briggs, Twin Peaks

Your build was informative, but is lvl 33 the soonest that Construct Shape can be taken?<br><br>What where the abilities granted when in Iron Golem form?<br><br>Was Unarmed Attack bonuses from those monk levels of use in Iron G form?  Or does IG form use the same principal as the dragon form in that you can't apply improved crit UA strike to the attack.

With a starting Wis of 18, you need 9 points.  You could take points at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.  That brings the total to 23.  Then you could take Great Wis at 21 and 24, and a further point at 24.  That's 26.  The next point would come at 27 if you took Great Wis, or at level 28 (which is what I would do), making the earliest possible point to take Construct Shape level 30.  <br><br>Sorry if that seems pedantic or condescending, but I had to think it through as well.  I decided to concentrate on Monk first (and get to level 12  ASAP for the SR), which pushed everything else back.  I also decided to get 13 levels of Shifter to get the bonus feat.  Making it level 33 before I hit Construct Shape.<br><br>As far as abilities in Construct Form go, I recommend checking out the Shifter FAQ at gamefaqs.  It's highly informative.<br><br>And I didn't know about the Improved Crit UA/Dragon thing.  So I don't know if it also occurs in Construct form.  I do know that you retain your attack bonuses and number of attacks in Construct form.<br>_________________<br>-------------------------------<br>"What do you fear most in the world?"<br>"The possibility that love is not enough."<br>-- Major Garland Briggs, Twin Peaks

Basically as an iron golem you have a decent damage resist, as well as immunities to most spells as well as mind effects like fear. As to the monk unarmed, working with golem form, I think they do, but am not 100% certain. I'll have to check if they are considered unarmed or natural weapons (like dragon shapes unarmed actually is).

I checked, and they don't use natural weapons. Your monk unarmed will work in full as an iron golem.
