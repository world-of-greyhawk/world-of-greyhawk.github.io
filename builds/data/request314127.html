Hey all,<br>I've been looking in the forums for a level 30 sorcerer build that suits my server's class modifications and couldn't find a good one so I'm asking you for some help, please <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif"> <br>Level capped at 30 as I mentioned, and Paladin/BG saves are modified to add saves according to the P/BG level (For example: 29 Sorc 1 Pally will only give +1 to saves no matter the charisma modifier, 27 Sorc 3 Pally will give +3 to saves, or 30 pally gets max charisma modifier).<br>Should I go with the pure sorc build? Or should I still use pally for the armor feat &amp; use automatic still spell?<br>Thanks in advance!

FTR will give you extra feats in addition to heavy armor and martial weapons.

Btw, the server is slow-leveling server.<br>If I want to DROP the auto-still-spell epic feats, should I go exactly like the exalted sorc, just not taking pally?<br>And if so, must I use these stats?<br>Str: 12<br>Dex: 12<br>Con: 14<br>Int: 14<br>Wis: 8<br>Cha: 16 <br>I'm really a rookie at characters creation though it seems that 12 DEX is quite a waste, no? And must I use 14 INT or can I use 13 (For Expertise) And use the other one for something else.. Should I even get Expertise &amp; Imp?<br>And what should I take instead of still spell?<br>And if I want it to be a PvM on a slow lvling server, should I take take the bard before lvl 30? Can I use monk/rogue instead? What is the difference?<br><br>Thanks for advance and sorry for all the questions <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ozperex on 12/30/09 17:38</span></i></p>

I've made a build that suits the server's modifications though I don't think it's optimized, tell me what you think.<br><br>Overview<br>Sorcerer: 29<br>Monk: 1<br>(First 29 levels go to Sorc, last one goes to Monk)<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Str: 12<br>Dex: 12<br>Con: 14<br>Int: 14<br>Wis: 8<br>Cha: 16 <br><br>(All attribute increases go to Charisma)<br><br>Feats:<br>1 - Extend Spell, Expertise<br>3 - Improved Expertise<br>6 - Empower Spell<br>9 - Spell Focus: Necromancy<br>12 - Greater Spell Focus: Necromancy<br>15 - Maximize Spell<br>18 - Combat Casting<br>21 - Improved Combat Casting<br>24 - Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy, Great Charisma 1<br>27 - Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor<br>30 (Monk) - Epic Spell: Epic Warding, Great Charisma 2<br><br>Skills go to Concetration, Discipline (Monk), Spellcraft, Tumble (Monk) &amp; Lore.<br>In my server I don't need UMD for scrolls.<br><br>What do you think?<br>Mainly it's Exalted Sorceress capped at 30 with no auto-still-spells &amp; Paladin.<br>Should I use something else instead of Monk?<br>Are the stats alright or should I drop some DEX / STR / INT?<br>Please tell me what you think <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>Thanks in advance.

I've tested the build I've posted and it seems that I've mistaken in a few things, here's the tested version<br>(Note: Class leveling order, attributes &amp; epic feats)<br><br>Again, the promo <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I've made a build that suits the server's modifications though I don't think it's optimized, tell me what you think.<br>Mainly it's Exalted Sorceress capped at 30 with no auto-still-spells &amp; Paladin.<br><br>Overview<br>Sorcerer: 29<br>Monk: 1<br>26 Sorc - 1 Monk - 3 Sorc<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Str: 10<br>Dex: 8<br>Con: 14<br>Int: 14<br>Wis: 8<br>Cha: 18 <br><br>(All attribute increases go to Charisma)<br><br>Feats:<br>1 - Extend Spell, Expertise<br>3 - Improved Expertise<br>6 - Empower Spell<br>9 - Spell Focus: Necromancy<br>12 - Greater Spell Focus: Necromancy<br>15 - Maximize Spell<br>18 - Combat Casting<br>21 - Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy<br>23 - Epic Spell: Mage Armor<br>24 - Improved Combat Casting<br>26 - Great Charisma 1<br>27 (Monk) - Great Charisma 2<br>30 - Great Charisma 3, Epic Spell: Hellball<br><br>Skills go to Concetration, Spellcraft, Discipline (Monk), Tumble (Monk) &amp; Heal.<br>In my server I don't need UMD for scrolls.<br>With Monk at level 27, I get exactly 30 Tumble (+6 AC) &amp; 30 Discipline.<br>At level 30 sorc I get 33 spellcraft, though I need 34 for epic warding, therefore the feat is not selected.

I would take a level of cleric and get divine shield as well, +10 AC is nothing to frown about.
