I'm trying to max saves pre-epic. I think they go primary is +1 every 2 levels and secondary is +1 every 3 levels. 6 Fighter and 6 WM would give me +6 to Fort and +4 to everything else (?). I'm not sure if this is the way it works though. The penalty's only for one level at that stage but I dunno about the feats...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Jennalee on 10/03/05 17:09</span></i></p>

This is a pretty solid dex fighter build.  The level progression and xp penalties are kind of ugly and I think you'd benefit a lot if you could get improved knockdown earlier - my first thought was switching it with blind-fight but I guess it would depend on if your environment has a lot of enemies with concealment bonuses or not.<br><br>Overall though, well-done <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   Whirlwind attack/improved whirlwind attack actually benefit this build because it lacks cleave/great cleave, even.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

The leveling order post-epic is quite jacked up to get SC IV. The original when I was messing with this had an easier template to level (no later EXP penalties) but instead had SC III, not IV but took Armor Skin.<br><br>21: Fighter(7): Epic Weapon Focus: Rapier<br>22: Weapon Master(7)<br>23: Fighter(8): Epic Weapon Specialization: Rapier<br>24: Rogue(9): DEX+1, Toughness, (DEX=26)<br>25: Fighter(9)<br>26: Rogue(10): Improved Evasion<br>27: Fighter(10): Great Dexterity I, Improved Knockdown, (DEX=27)<br>28: Rogue(11): DEX+1, (DEX=28)<br>29: Fighter(11)<br>30: Rogue(12): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=29)<br>31: Fighter(12): Improved Whirlwind Attack<br>32: Rogue(13): DEX+1, Defensive Roll, (DEX=30)<br>33: Fighter(13): Epic Dodge<br>34: Rogue(14)<br>35: Fighter(14): Epic Prowess<br>36: Rogue(15): DEX+1, Self Concealment I, (DEX=31)<br>37: Fighter(15)<br>38: Rogue(16): Self Concealment II<br>39: Fighter(16): Self Concealment III, Armor Skin<br>40: Rogue(17): DEX+1, (DEX=32)<br><br>EWS, IKD, Imp Whirlwind, Epic Prowess and Armor Skin were taken as Fighter bonus feats - I wouldn't touch the other epic feats but those can be swapped. Also consider taking Imp Expertise instead of Armor Skin for good dex tanking with SC if using this template.<br><br>If I were to try going Halfling, I'd drop Toughness and get SC V with 19 Rogue/ 14 Fighter and 7 WM with the same starting stats as there'd be no EXP penalties but elf is nicer IMO.<br><br>Not getting many comments though o_o. No TWF, cleave but base 44 AB and Improved Whirlwind Attack with SC...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Jennalee on 10/04/05 12:47</span></i></p>

Well, whirlwind attack/IWWA are not very popular/powergamey feats.  They take your entire round's worth of actions so if you're hasted and single wielding you'll only "break even" if you have 5 enemies around you - and the damage will be spread around them, which is considered inferior to focusing damage on one enemy until it's dead.<br><br>That's why cleave/great cleave are popular - you focus your damage but when something dies you cleave the rest of your attacks instead of losing them.<br><br>But, taking cleave and great cleave require 13+ strength and power attack or a monk level.  In this case I think WWA isn't a bad path but will end up being something you'd use against trivial enemies.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Remember that IWWA gets all 5 attacks at best BAB, so break even with 5 enemies is not really true......<br>One question. If you stealth into the middle of a group and unleash IWWA, will you get sneak attacks with it also? That would make this fella magnificent.<br>Another thing that goes for me. I dont like wasting so much just for 7 lvl's of WM, but if you can sneak with WW, it is perhaps worth it.
