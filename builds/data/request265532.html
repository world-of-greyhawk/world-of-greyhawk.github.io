I posted this here as well, just in case...  This is a level 30 build request, as the Pre-Epic forum is a bit dead lately <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br>World Specifics:<br><br>-Devastating Critical is dissallowed<br>-Shadowdancer is dissallowed<br>-RDD requires 12 levels of Sorcerer or Bard<br>-Do not count on Weapons or Armour beyond +3<br>-No spells of great consequence have been changed<br>-Weapon Buffs cannot stack (no GMW and Keen on a weapon)<br>-No Perma-Haste or True Sight on items<br>-No damage immunities or KD immunity through items<br>-Minimum of 3 levels per class taken (No 1-Monk-Cheese)<br>-Once you take 1 level in any class, you must take 3 before switching (no lvl 1 cleric; lvl 1 rogue; lvl 2 cleric etc) Once you have 3 levels in a class anything goes.<br><br><br>I am looking for a powerful melee build (non-caster, or minor casting only) That focuses on the Two-Bladed Sword.<br><br>Key requirements of the build:<br><br>He needs to be Drow: <br>- Normal Elven Stats apply<br>- Soft bonuses of +2 INT and +2 CHA added as well<br>- Can utilize Darkness 1/day (if it helps)<br>- Favored Class Wizard.<br>- ECL +2<br><br>I don't mind XP penalties due to classes, though I would like to avoid if possible of course.  He is of course an RP build (hence the Two-Bladed Sword instead of something easy, like longsword <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">     ) but he needs to maximize fighting prowess within the setup laid out...  I am willing to consider other options than the TBS if needed; but I am going for the "out there" rp potential of a real drow monster here, so it would need to be interesting <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>I do not care what the class mix is, but it has to be primarily melee based.  I was thinking WM heavy but with only 30 levels it does get a little tough..  So if you have other ideas, please feel free to educate me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>thanks!<br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By 4SakN on 02/07/07 16:33</span></i></p>

If you play on NWN1 servers with ECL, try to see if it actually is ECL. I have encountered the same and you could only lvl up to vl 28 as a Drow. Look into it.<br>_________________<br>Valkos clueless

aah, excellent question!  No; our server does in fact correct the issue and allow ECL races to level to 30.  It only effects the XP you earn at each level, but not the level max <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world

Another question.<br><br>Does the bonus stats apply as buffs or as natural stats?<br>_________________<br>Valkos clueless

They are buffs, not hard stats. that's what I meant by soft stat increases, sorry <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world
