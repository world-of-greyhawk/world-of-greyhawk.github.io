Playable PvM (level 1-40), or PvP (really <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>Curse Blade (Sword Version – Dev.Crit (2006)<br>By Deborah Tyr<br><br>IS THE SONG STRONGER THAN THE SWORD?<br><br>Concept: this build is an improvement over my very first character here in the guild, the Hex Blade, who is that charismatic musician who went off to knight school and mastered his blade so well as to land a devastating critical, among other neat feats. Accordingly, this is a revised version of my very first character, my inaugural bard/wm/ftr in the guild; he was okay; however, using the exact same class combinations, I’ve completely re-tweaked him for much improved playability, and including (among other things) exceptional AB, higher HPs and, notwithstanding the drop in bard levels, much better arcane scroll access as a result of max’d out UMD/Spellcraft. His dev crit DC is much improved, too! <br><br>His saves may at first glance seem rather problematic, such saves should nonetheless be “savable” as a result of his/her UMD/scroll access, which also gives him some rather nice access to even more damage types and also self-buffs for everything, such that he can even self-buff himself to the cap. <br><br>His most impressive attribute, however, would appear to be his exceptional AB, and also the crit factor; as a high level weapon master with the strength to put out some serious damage, he can and should be able to make quick work of the enemy even if such enemy should manage to make their saving throw vs. dev.crit. Without further adieu, and with thanks, please meet the Curse Blade, Sword Version (the new and improved Song version (no dev. Crit) in due course will follow). In the meantime, I do so hope that everyone “really” enjoys this character who, for all intents and purposes takes over for the Hex; as always, I welcome and do so encourage all of your great thoughts, critiques and, most importantly, nice praises, too -- For everyone who shares my philosphy re: combat bards, and/or took the time to comment on my builds, this one's for you (and, of course, because the player's deserve all we can do <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   <br><br>For the original character, please: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "241384", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> <br><br>Curse Blade (Sword Version): Overview--<br>Fighter(12), Bard(3), Weapon Master(25), <br>Race: Human   <br>Alignment: Neutral Good<br>Hitpoints: 502*<br><br>FINAL STATS:<br>STR: 16 (32)<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 11<br><br><br>Saving Throws:<br>Fort: 25 (27 Endurance), +1 Song<br>Will: 17 (19 Owl’s Wisdom), +1 Song<br>Reflex: 23 (25 Cat’s Grace)  <br><br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8<br>Immunity: Mind-Effects (Protection Spell), Fear (UMD/Clarity)<br><br>Note: The Curse Blade is Fully Skilled in the use of UMD/Spellcraft, thus can buff his/her saves with UMD/scrolls, as follows (illustrative examples only):<br><br>+1 Resistance <br>+2 Aura of Vitality <br>+2 Protection  <br>+2 Battletide<br>+1 Prayer<br><br>BAB: 29<br>AB (max, naked): 50/45/40/35 <br>+5 UMD/Bull’s Strength<br>+3 UMD/Greater Magic Weapon<br>+1 UMD/Prayer<br>--<br>AB: 59/54/49/44 (*+6 Taunt)<br>+1 UMD/Divine Favor<br>+2 UMD/Battle Tide<br>+2 Aura of Vitality<br>+ MAXED UMD/True Strike<br>--<br>AB: 78/73/68/63 (*+6 Taunt)<br><br>Damage (mundane greataxe, illustrative):<br>1-12 + 22 (crit. 15-20/4)<br>+2 Bard Song<br>+5 UMD/GMW<br>+3 UMD/Aura of Vitality<br>+1 UMD/Prayer<br>+1 UMD/Battletide<br>+1 UMD/Aid<br>--<br>(36-47x’s 2 UMD/Haste =  72-94; Crit: 376 damage<br><br>Note: with this high level WM and also high STR, might also consider a scythe (for even more awesome crit damage).<br><br><br>AC: 21 (naked), 29 (mundane plate only)<br>+4 Mage Armor<br>+3 UMD/Shield<br>--<br>AC: 36<br> <br>With Dex boost and +5 Items, AC &gt; 60s<br><br><br>Spell Casting: Bard(1)<br>Cantrips (5 Spells)<br>Level 1 (3 Spells)<br>Note: Can unlock more spells with a Cha.

In reality, any char with umd can do it, so it really isnt something that is important to put in a build, ESPECIALLY if you play on a pw where scrolls are hard to come by (as are many pws that I have played).  IMHO, it is much better to lay the character as it is, not as it could be.  In many ways, stating ab, ac, saves, damage,etc with UMD scroll buffs is NO different than posting a build for a specific weapon or a specific pw (which, if one isnt clear are both frowned upon here).  <br><br>The thing Im tryin to figure out is, your AB is 50 "maxed", but what does that mean?  Cuz, if it means what I think you are saying, the BASE ab would be 42, which is only 1 better than my rogue which can use ALL the same scrolls that you suggest.<br><br>I am also tryin to figure out your damage..  d12 yes  +str (32-10=22/2=11 +6ews) 17   Why does it say 22?  If you are going to add the extra, please dont put it in the total.  It confuses the issue.<br><br>The other thing is the AC.  You have 29 which is decent for a non-dexer in fp, then you list some spells.   Then you suggest with +5 you get above 60!  Now, I know that the +5 doesnt stack with these, I'm just hoping that EVERYONE does!  IMHO it makes more sense to post the mundane ONLY and leave the fluff for ingame.  It seems like you are trying to make your build better than it is through misdirection (remember I'm a SALESMAN <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">  and you can't sell a salesman ).<br><br>All in all, it pains me to see such a beautiful build being presented in such a way!  The build in itself, without the trimings is GREAT!  The umd stuff is totally unnecessary. The taunt stuff is unnecessary.  Anytime you take high str and 25 wm lvls WITH bard you cannot go wrong!  All I'm tryin to say is, you dont have to hide the build in alot of item specifics when it is beautiful as is.  I guess I'm just a "natural" guy <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"> <br><br>peace<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/28/06 00:22:49 (GMT) -- TyrTemplar<br><br>This post is for general information purposes only, and does not constitute a legal opinion or render any legal advice.

Hey, Av....and so nice to see ya (btw, you named a character after me (oh me god) - heck, ya know I'm gonna check that out --- <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    As to natural, let's puts it this way: the Curse, he can buff total, he can breach the capped AB, AND he can gets some rather decent AC....<br><br>I puts all that in there (ie, UMD scrolls) 'cause, for real, I checked em all out in PvP, fully tested, etc.(since I am, afterall, suggesting that the Curse Blade, shall we say the Big Brother/Big Sister to me original character the Hex (again, s/he was alright, do ya well PvM, but in PvP . . . needed so much stuff as to make it worth it, unlike THIS character . . . Does it all by itself; thus, me callin' the Curse the PVP/big brother-big sister, so to speak - also said, just learned much <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>So, don't get confused, Av . . . honest, I seriously checeked it all out (as to ie. stacking, and yet, as we all know, there's more choices/equip't, like a simple ring of resitance to all saves +3/+5, which I didn't add <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    In other words, there's a lot more easy buffin' out there possible, with this character's UMD/Spellcraft enablin' all such buffin and pluses for sure; point bein' though, I took it "only" to what I considered decent/necessary for PvP, and as a so-called proper measure of comparison to me very old character (the first I did here, and still as a concept do so love (cool, in other words, PvM or .... in other words, this one for real is PvP, but also Pvm, too: in PvM, less is more, ya know? (Hex is okay in that dept; this one's so "more" <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    )<br><br>Anyway, point is, focussed on that wondrous AB thing (see the line); can't be nerfed, can't be tossed, no worries, just his own li'l charm as-is, and with UMD/Spellcraft max'ed out, well <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     --- ah, but with WM and dev crit + crit factor, ..... well, what can I say, maybe no need extra buffs (again, the raw stats, CANNOT be nerfed!).... more is good, which he's got,  dependig on where/how ya plays, yes? (thank you, everyone: for real, YOU ALL JUST TAUGHT ME WELL, and encouraged me on (including you AV, and wow, a character named after me or me god, the tyr, --- thank you so much, Av, gonna check it out! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/07/06 06:52</span></i></p>

Nice meleer, I'd actually go for a more standard FTR 11/Bard 1/WM 28, Bard only for a final skill dump. Otherwise I'd give up some skillpoints and start with CHA 8, STR 17 and change Epic Fortitude to another Great STR probably keeping Bard only in epic for a net +2 AB and +1 to Dev Crit DC.<br><br>Solid straight meleer, not really much more to say. UMD adds a lot of versatility.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?

Thanks, Kail! And great thinkin' ; I took bard pre-ep for the "theme reason" - ie, to enable curse song or what have you, should folks want it, plus some early spell (albeit low level) &amp; some early UMD access; ah, but at only a couple levels of bard, that curse song: well, we're talking a curse here of only -1 AB, -2 damage, and -1 to saves (fort, will), so not exactly a powerful performance, but this one did give up the song for the knight path <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    Plus, bards are just so much fun, &amp; really do have some great skills (i.e., UMD). <br><br>But for sure, if don't want/care about the theme per se, or low level bard spells...(as always, Kail, great suggestions, and for sure a very nice alternative - afterall, even more AB and one more point on the DC dev crit factor, well, what's to argue <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">   (thanks, Kail!).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/07/06 21:30</span></i></p>

First, a character with 50 AB with mundane weapon can never get 78 AB without smite, a little disappointed in you here, Deb <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  . Naked AB + Stat boost which is max +6 and then another +20 from the mother of all buffers.

Hey, Grim, and thanks. Listen, I *know* we discussed all of this, we did, and I listened well, let me assure you; I fully checked, to confirm and test it all, I did. <br><br>Took this knight out, got him some nice scrolls (why, he shops where all rogues do (or clerics, mages, pally's, etc.) - point bein', he hunts it down and/or makes purchases like everybody else; he can do this b/c of the UMD I built into him (and thus such buffs come highly recommended as per the list, and reason for bard, apart from the theme of course). But, if scrolls are not available on your world, then it won't matter much anyway, since no one can get their hands on 'em either (in which case, his naked BAB 29, +50/45/30/35 sleeping with a mundane axe, able to dish 1-12 + 22 damage with that very same mundane axe, x's 4 crit (x's 5 if pick up the scythe) and his Bard "lesser dispel" spell, and resistance, and protection, and magic weapon at the very least... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">        <br><br><br>But as to the AB thing, really, Grim: I checked it all out - on a server, on a player-made mod, AND in the Official Campaign (since we all know that sometimes those servers and/or mods do some, well, curious things all their own); here are the results, fully tested and confirmed, in all three places, brand new game (so no corrupt files), and I kid you not:<br><br>AB 50 (naked, with mundane axe only)<br>Cast the following (UMD/scrolls):<br>+5 Greater Magic Weapon<br>+2 Battletide<br>+1 Aid<br>--<br>AB 58 <br>--<br>+20 True Strike<br>--<br>AB 78/73/68/63 (&amp; enhancement to damage, saves &amp; AC, too)<br><br>That's it; it worked, in all three places, and including the OC (which OC I just took him into again, confirmed that it was a mundane axe, he was totally naked, and just did the exact same thing again, and it once again breached the cap, as above stated (and thus I highly recommend doing same <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">        <br><br>Gun powder, huh?

Now that's more like it, UMD is ok separated like that IMO.<br><br>Recommended scrolls? lol, you miss lots of good ones, (True Strike's duration sucks, use other AB buffs), and I would recommend mostly long-term buffs like Darkfire or Flame Weapon, but anyway, no one recommends Tenser's Transformation now or what? it's awesomely strong and normally a problem to spellcasting, but you don't have a good spellcasting ot begin with, so excellency goes in.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/08/06 16:28</span></i></p>

Hey, Kail: actually....Yes, I er did look at the character sheet, while dev critting some critters - ah, but indeed the sheet, it lies! I am also in contact with Grim about this, too (some minor edits to follow (see below). That sheet: strange thing though, 'cause it seems to heed the cap on everything else, but not TS, &amp; hence, the issue (as for real, it *did* show up, and in writing no less <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">     <br><br>Anyway, while odd, the cap is indeed not breached by TS, even though the sheet says otherwise plain and clear. Thus, just so we're all clear on this, <br><br>* Sleeping naked with his axe (No buffs): <br>BAB 29, AB +50, <br>+1 Song, <br>+1 Magic Weapon, <br>--<br>Total: +52, +6 taunt (or 58)&lt;---this bein' correct<br><br>* At the Cap: <br>BAB 29, AB +76, +6 taunt (or 82 -- NOT 84, since TS doesn't breach the cap). <br><br>AND as to the scrolls, while the formula I laid out will easily and quickly get ya to the cap (among so many other scroll combinations, and/or magical weaponry/other equip't of course), nothin' will take ya over on this class-combo, no matter what the character sheet says. Sure hope that +76 is enough <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   Also, can taunt yer enemy's AC down (-6), so ya in turn gets a +6 AB boost (which gives an effective cap AB of +82 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">          <br><br>Tyr<br><br>ps. seriously, wish I had better news, folks; as the old sayin' goes, just when you think you've tested enough, get out there &amp; test, test, test some more (at least, &amp; once and for all, everyone now knows for sure about the so-called TS mystery; and certainty -- along with combat debug <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    -- is good!

As to your scroll suggestions: very nice. Yeah, I went for the "economy box/cheap ticket" version, but you've some very cool recommendations in there! For sure, those skills, especially UMD, just adds so much more flavor and versatility to this character; while he doesn't need all that stuff, still, just so much more fun, indeed.
