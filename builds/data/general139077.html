I'll give it a shot. . . though human archers can't really compare to arcane archers, so unless you make him half-elven this will not be as strong as it could be. . . &lt;end disclaimer&gt;<br><br>I worked within the following:<br>1) Had to be human;<br>2) Could not use magic directly (rogues do get UMD, and I used it here)<br>3) Some historical accuracy: for that, I assumed RH was a templar w/ King Richard (it's believed they were in fact friends) and had fought in crusades, etc.  *This gave me the chance to use C of Torm, though most probably wouldn't.*<br>4) Given the tough AB vs. arcane archer standards, I decided to use more fighter and blend in the rogue levels. (might not be what you want)<br><br>Level Progression:<br>Fighter 1-7, CoT 8-16, F 17-20, Rogue 21, CoT 22-23, F24, CoT 25-39, Rouge 40.<br><br>End Result: Fighter 12, Rogue 2, C of Torm 26<br><br>Feats:<br>1) Point Blank Shot, WF: Longbow, Blooded<br>2) Rapid Shot<br>3) Iron Will<br>4) Weapon Specialization: Longbow<br>6) Toughness, WF: Longsword<br>9) Lightning Reflexes, Improved Critical: Longbow<br>11) Called Shot<br>12) Extra Smiting<br>13) Expertise<br>15) Great Fortitude, Dodge<br>17) Blind Fight<br>18) Stealthy<br>19) Improved Expertise<br>21) Great Dex I<br>22) Epic WF: Longbow<br>24) Great Dex II, Epic Weapon Spec: Longbow<br>27) Great Dex III, Epic Prowess<br>30) Great Dex IV<br>31) Armor Skin<br>33) Great Dex V<br>35) Epic Toughness I<br>36) Great Dex VI<br>39) Blinding Speed, Epic Toughness II<br><br>Skills: Disc 42, Hide 43, MS 43, Spot 13, Tumble 43, UMD 43 -- when Fighter and CoT only invest in Discipline<br><br>Attributes<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 16 -&gt; 32<br>Con 10<br>Int 14<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 16<br><br>This character will have great saves, good attacks, able to Smite and use Divine Wrath, use magic devices (True Strike scroll for shooting apples on people's heads), and sneak around.  He also can wield a longsword when the need calls and improved expertise will increase his AC by 10.<br><br>BA 30<br>AB w/ Regular Longbow 44/39/34/29<br>Max Hits 472 (I wound up w/ 389 when I tested)<br>Naked AC 31<br><br>AB w/ Wrath 55/50/45/40 (damage will be 1d8 + 6 + <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"> <br><br>Smite Evil (Sheriff Nottingham) +3 to attack and +26 points of damage<br><br>Fortitude Save 38 (49 w/ Divine Wrath) -- makes him hard to get a devastating critical on especially w/ Divine Wrath<br>Reflex Save 45 (56)<br>Will 30 (41) -- can switch out Blinding Speed for Epic Will and get this up to 34 if need be<br><br>Let me know if that works well for you or was what you were thinking.  I can send you the spreadsheet w/ the build on it if you like.  Character should be strong throughout levelling, though low on AC at times due to waiting for a rogue level to pop up.  During those times, you can wear plate.<br><br>Any suggestions, thoughts, etc., are welcome.  Happy playing.

Classes I think I would choose are <br><br>Fighter/COT (he started off as a Knight) switching later to Ranger (stalker type woodsman character with good ability with a bow). Dont really see him as much of a Rogue, but I would concede you could play him that way and in fact it would make a better build IMO.<br><br>Just my 2cents .<br><br>Syrath

If you use the PRC , you could make him into a peerless archer.
