"What i was thinking about doing, is getting this cleric 4 attacks per round.

Also, you may NOT want to get your BAB up to 16. The reason is the spell Divine Power. <br><br>If your BAB is 15 or less, when you use Divine Power you boost your BAB to 20 and get the 4th attack at full BAB. So with a BAB of 15 or less, you go from 15/10/5 to 20/15/10/20. If your BAB is 16 or more, DP still raises it to 20, but the attack schedule will be 20/15/10/5. You only get the 4th attack at 20 if it is added, if you already have a 4th attack it just gets the same bonus the others do (+1 to +4, depending on what your BAB is). <br><br>Given that, I would go lower on the Fighter and WM levels, and higher on the Cleric levels. Say, Fighter 4/WM 7/Cleric 29, or Fighter 4/WM 13/Cleric 23, with no more than 3 Fighter and WM levels pre-epic.<br><br>TM
