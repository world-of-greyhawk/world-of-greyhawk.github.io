I Have a couple of questions about a build i'm more or less modifying (from an already posted one). Firstly a general Shifter question. what is IIKD? I see that all over the place on shifter builds but cna't figure t out, i've always been rubbish with acronyms. <br><br>Anyway the concept for my build is more or less RP based, but i want to have some Fighting capabilities. Basically a shifter that focuses on the Rakshasa Shape. <br><br>For playability I wanted 3 monk levels (one pre-lvl 9 because Darkmoon robes on the server are lvl 9 req) one 20 or early twenties to give a boost to ac (from tumble) mid way through the build. And one at the end for the last umph of Tumble and Disc. <br><br>I also wanted the minimum Shifter Lvls mainly because i only intend to use Rak shape, in fact walk aroudn in that shape at all times. (Actually play a rakshasa) Also I beleive the more Druid lvls the more buffs, and dmg on Maximised Ice Storm.<br><br>On the server i play there are subraces, three of which have +2 to wisdom,Undead, Svirfneblin (SP) and Aasimar. Undead is mor eor less out of the question, Svirfneblin can't use tower sheilds but do get an SR bonus but with Rak spell immunity it doens't make a difference also gers a -2 Str i beleive which is annoying for carrying loot unshifted. Then Aasimar is +2 wis +2 cha, with no negs, and only a ecl of 1. <br><br>reading traversc's Rak build he took 28 lvls of druid to get the best maximised ice storm... but with 3 lvls of monk, 11 druid, that leaves me with 26 lvls of druid, which i beleive deals 60 dmg on ice storm? <br><br>The thing is, in his build he takes 12 druid lvls pre-epic, thus needing 3 epic shifter lvls to get outsider shape at lvl 24. I pretty much want to get him to lvl 21 and relax on lvling him, because wih +2 to wis if you go druid 8/monk 2/Shifter 11 you can have Outsider shape by lvl 21. <br><br>So what i am wondering is taking 4 less pre-epic druid levels kill the Maximised ice storm too badly? Also What items woudl you reccomend? I was thinking boots of sun soul +4, Haste robes, Cloak protec +7, Amulet of Protection +5, but as for rings, gloves, and belt i have no idea. There is a helm that gives +3 to wis and +5 to tumble which i'll probably use. <br><br>Also Traversc's build took Dwarf (or gnome) for the con bonus and yanked con to 21 and got 3 dmg reduc. After testign the build i liked the added -9 reduc when a melee'er comes close so when they do get past the 70 some ac they still have to get through premonition and dmg reduction. <br><br>So that's basicaly what i was thinking any help?<br>_________________<br>~I am the wisest man on earth because I know one thing, and that is I know nothing.~<br>-Cairne<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Almalith on 04/26/05 00:58</span></i></p>

You will lose these increased stats when shifted, and that is where they hurt in the long run.<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>So what i am wondering is taking 4 less pre-epic druid levels kill the Maximised ice storm too badly?

Even a druid lvl22 is pretty strong.<br>As for items, only the highest number for a given stat improvement will shift.  So, if you have a +2 ring of str and a +3 ring of str you will only shift the +3.  Same with AC enhancement.  You can wear heavy armor if you have the feat without fear of losing the monk abilities when shifted - the base armor class is removed on shifting.<br>You're focusing on the Rak form which basically shifts items and armor, so you can wear haste on any item BUT if you want the ability to be hasted in non-armed forms as well (eg dragon) get haste on robes (Dark Moon is good for this).<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Also Traversc's build took Dwarf (or gnome) for the con bonus and yanked con to 21 and got 3 dmg reduc.

So, unless you want it for feats, it's not really that important, your wisdom is much more important as that is not altered (to recollection, might be wrong there).
