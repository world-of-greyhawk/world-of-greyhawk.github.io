Unarmed is probably one of the worst weapon choices for a build that wants to use disarm effectively because it counts as a tiny weapon.  Supposedly it does allow you to actually grab the weapon into your own inventory, which is nice, but that's only important when it works, which wouldn't be nearly as often with an unarmed attack as with a greatsword.<br><br>Steve

You also need to let people know a great deal more about what kinds of items are available on the world.  Different builds will be the most effective on worlds with tons of high powered magical items and immunities available and worlds with little in the way of such items.  It would also help to know if there are any changes implemented on the server (spells nerfed, feats outlawed, etc.).<br><br>Steve

On my Red Dragon Monk I put Improved Disarm and use true strike to add +20 to the roll for just long enough to try disarming a few times <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>-DaMouse

This might help explain why there are so many monks and RDD builds on the server.<br><br>Steve

Also I think with the full dex buff on him and +4 gloves (I was using +4 iirc) you can true strike to about 70AB.. my dragon shifters discipline (diff one from the one i posted, with epic skill focus disc) is 76 fully buffed iirc so even massive disciplines can be overcome by true strike if you pray hard enough <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>-DaMouse

It's not a feat, it's a first level wizard/sorcerer spell, and if you take sorcerer for your 1 arcane level in order to qualify for RDD, you can choose that spell.  +20 to your AB for 9 seconds (which is basically 1.5 rounds).  Doesn't last very long, but if you have a lot of attacks like a monk, can be very useful.<br><br>Steve
