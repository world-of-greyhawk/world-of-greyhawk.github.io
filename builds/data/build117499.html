Well, I didn't really want to repost my earlier build, but I couldn't edit the one that's locked down. I added the totals for the skills; so, here is my Shifter build, with the edits:<br><br>I know there are a lot of Monk/Druid/Shifter builds out there, but I wanted one that wouldn't be broken if BioWare ever fixed the Monk attack bug. Also, it just seems more "right" to play characters that don't use game exploits.<br><br>Also, you will notice a few places where the feats are listed like "Feat1/Feat2" this is because I had a hard time role-playing wise to allow a neutral or good Shifter to take Undead Shape as a feat. It just seemed wrong somehow. However, if I had an evil Shifter then I felt I could justify it. So, below is the build for both an evil shifter and a neutral or good shifter (just the feat differences really).<br><br>I hope you all enjoy.<br><br><br><br>Long Death Shifter/Old Order Shifter<br><br>I chose Half-elf as the race, but others would work as well.<br><br>Base Abilities<br>Strength 10<br>Dexterity 10<br>Constitution 10<br>Wisdom 18<br>Intelligence 14<br>Charisma 10<br><br>Clvl Class ClassLvl StatIncr Feats<br>1 Druid 1 Strong Soul<br>2 Monk 2<br>3 Druid 2 Expertise<br>4 Druid 3 Wis +1<br>5 Druid 4<br>6 Druid 5 Alertness<br>7 Shifter 1<br>8 Shifter 2 Wis +1<br>9 Shifter 3 Improved Initiative<br>10 Shifter 4<br>11 Shifter 5<br>12 Shifter 6 Wis +1 Toughness<br>13 Shifter 7<br>14 Shifter 8<br>15 Shifter 9 Weapon Finesse<br>16 Shifter 10 Wis +1<br>17 Monk 2<br>18 Monk 3 Improved Expertise<br>19 Monk 4<br>20 Monk 5 Wis +1<br>21 Monk 6 Great Wisdom<br>22 Monk 7<br>23 Monk 8<br>24 Shifter 11 Wis +1 Undead Shape/Outsider Shape<br>25 Monk 9<br>26 Monk 10<br>27 Monk 11 Great Wisdom<br>28 Monk 12 Wis +1<br>29 Monk 13<br>30 Monk 14 Great Wisdom<br>31 Monk 15<br>32 Monk 16 Wis +1<br>33 Shifter 12 Outsider Shape/Epic Prowess<br>34 Shifter 13 Construct Shape<br>35 Shifter 14<br>36 Shifter 15 Wis +1 Epic Prowess/Superior Initiative<br>37 Shifter 16 Dragon Shape<br>38 Shifter 17<br>39 Monk 17 Improved Ki Strike I<br>40 Monk 18 Wis +1<br><br>Level 40 Abilities<br>Strength 10<br>Dexterity 10<br>Constitution 10<br>Wisdom 31<br>Intelligence 14<br>Charisma 10<br><br>On Skills:<br><br>This was pretty hard to figure out for this build, the problem is almost too many skill points. A few pointers, get the 5 or so levels of Spellcraft when it's available (Druid Levels). This builds all about the AC, so raise Tumble when available. I also tend to raise the stealth skills and Spot and Listen as they are class skills for the shifter. Oh, and don't forget to at least put one point into Open Locks and Disarm Traps by the time the Kobold Commando is available.<br><br>Here is a possible outcome for the skills at level 40<br><br>Animal Empathy 8<br>Concentration 20<br>Disable Trap 5<br>Discipline 30<br>Heal 5<br>Hide 20<br>Listen 15<br>Lore 25<br>Move Silently 20<br>Open Lock 5<br>Persuade 6<br>Search 10<br>Spellcraft 9<br>Spot 15<br>Tumble 40<br>_________________<br>"Illusion can be a most powerful tool in gaining admiration and trust, though it is rarely effective in maintaining it." - Me<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 02:22</span></i></p>
