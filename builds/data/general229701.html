Hi All <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>I'm looking for some good ideas on the best builds to take down Palemasters in PvP. The PW I play on has some good RP, and an evil guild of Palemsters have started to get a bit ***y and need to be taken down a peg or 2 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>I've tried a 26cleric/2Pal/12CoT build, built for a high AB, extra damage types and high saves...he rocks in PvM, can take on all sorts of PvP, but he just doesnt cut it when fighting Palemasters. I'm currently working on a 4F/16Pal/20CoT with Great Smite 10. Hit em hard and fast, but I'm worried that his buffs will be dispelled almost instantly by just about anyone, and if he gets taunted, he just wont be able to hit them even with his 14Charisma bonus with Great Smite. I've seen an awesome build in action, 26Sorc/4Pal/10RDD, but while I'm reasonable at building chars myself, I just cant get my head around getting the most out of bonus feats and Level progression...<br><br>I've been playing the PW for a few years, so have just about any item you could dream of to equip him with (the PW uses UOAbigail's Crafting System...for those that don't know, that means weapons/armour up to +8, and some cool rings (Up to +50 skill bonuses) and ammy's (more novelty value than powerful))<br><br>So what do you think? Whats the best build to take down a PM when he's likely to be wearing some uber items and be built by some awesome PvP builders? And what tactics would you suggest for your build?<br><br>Thanks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br><b>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****</b><br><br><b>DaMouse404</b><br><br>I'd try investing in some rogue levels to get use magic device personally just so you can splat him with Mord scrolls, then because you're a cleric, WORD OF FAITH!

oops...sorry about putting this up in the wrong forum <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_redface.gif">  <br><br>I'm facing both melee PMs and casting PMs...it's a guild specifically made up of PMs, so there are lots of different builds, all with at least 10lvls PM...<br><br>There are 3 that seem next to impossible to beat though, a 29sorc/10pm/1monk, and a bard/pm that I'm not really sure of the exact build (he has huge ac, taunt, curse song and bard song, epic mage armour and epic warding), and a bard/PM/RDD which seems to be next to impossible to hit, and soaks up any damage when you do manage to hit it (heh...I saw another build designed to soak pain go up against him and after about half an hour they both decided to call it a draw, both virtually uninjured <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">   ...)<br><br>From what I can gather, most of their builds end up with AC in the 80's when fully equipped, and they're either spellcasters with shields up that deal a lot of damage if you hit them and fire off a lot of spells if you try to cast against them, or they're melee builds that don't hit you that often themselves, but when they do they do a lot of damage and are hard to hit/damage in return...<br><br>The PW I play on has a rare drop in it which is a PvPers best friend...a Shadow Hood, which gives immunity to harm and IGMS, so those 2 spells are pretty much out as a way to bring them down. Their immunity to crits and shields like acid sheath pretty much negates a f/wm build as well.<br><br>So I guess I'm looking for builds that do heaps of damage in 1 or 2 hits, hence my attempt at a great smite build, or a spellcaster with very high spell penetration that specialises in unsavable spells...<br><br>So here's the build I'm working on now, my smiter...Unfortunatly, I didnt write down my cleric build so cant give you details, he's quite old now and I've forgotten <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">   )<br><br>Any ideas on other builds or other ways to kill them?<br><br>STR: 14 <br>DEX: 08 <br>CON: 08 <br>WIS: 14 <br>INT: 10 <br>CHAR: 18 <br><br>RACE: HUMAN <br><br>1 (F) Power Attack, Weapon Focus: Longsword, Toughness <br>2 (F) Knockdown <br>3 (F) Called Shot <br>4 (F) +1 Char, Weapon Specialization: Longsword <br>5 (P) <br>6 (P) Extra Smiting <br>7 (P) <br>8 (P) +1 Char <br>9 (P) Divine Might <br>10 (P) <br>11 (P) <br>12 (P) +1 Char, Divine Shield <br>13 (P) <br>14 (P) <br>15 (P) Extend Spell <br>16 (P) +1 Char <br>17 (P) <br>18 (P) Extra Turning <br>19 (P) <br>20 (P) +1 Char <br>21 (C) Great Charisma <br>22 (C) Epic Weapon Focus <br>23 (C) <br>24 (C) +1 Char, Great Charisma, Epic Weapon Specilization <br>25 (C) <br>26 (C) Great Smiting 1 <br>27 (C) Great Smiting 2 <br>28 (C) +1 STR, Great Smiting 3 <br>29 (C) <br>30 (C) Great Smiting 4, Great Smiting 5 <br>31 (C) <br>32 (C) +1 STR <br>33 (C) Great Smiting 6 <br>34 (C) Great Smiting 7 <br>35 (C) <br>36 (C) +1 STR, Great Smiting 8 <br>37 (C) <br>38 (C) Great Smiting 9 <br>39 (C) Great Smiting 10 <br>40 (C) +1 STR <br><br>F- Fighter <br>P- Paladin <br>C- Champion of Torm <br><br>Will Have a 68AB, when fully buffed and equipped and a mid 70’s AC… What I did for skills was put 1 in taunt, and max concentration while still taking Pally levels..

Smites work only vs evil (good if you are a BG), if the PM players are smart then they've got neutral PMs, so forget about smiting builds.<br>I would try a good dragon build (put cleric in the equation and you've got a super selfbuffing dragon), or a cleric build with high implosion DC.<br>Try the search engine, there's lotsa of them.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

I have to agree with Kail here.  If these guys are good enough to make builds that are very tough, they will be good enough to have them neutral.  I know you would never catch me playing as good or evil if I know PvP is afoot, unless the server has strict no neutrality rules, and you have to choose between good or evil.  So, smite would be useless if that is the case.  I probably would not play a melee build against these guys either.  Have you thought about going caster heavy?  A Wiz 38/ Melee Class 1/ Bard 1?  You will have excellent casting capabilities, as well as be able to wear the best armor/shields, and be able to max out tumble, umd, and any other bard skills.  You could sub Sorc for Wiz, and have a wicked taunt of your own with your charisma bonus and maxed taunt.  By going Caster Heavy, you will also have max concentration and will be less susceptible to getting taunted yourself.  You have plenty of other spells besides spamming IGMS that will work.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

Try this old build from Mithradates. He often knew what he did. they will not be able to touch you with spells at all, except greater Ruin, but that alone won't kill you.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "196360", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>This build has SR 66 which makes him untouchable by casters. Since you will be up against PM10 builds, you will at the most need SR 56. You can either drop SR feats down to SR 5, and improving other things, or drop monk levels for some fighter/rog/bard to grab EWS, UMD to get hold of Mord and Breach scrolls, but since this character uses bow, get some arrows you know will do damage, and get a lot since their AC will be high (even in a Wiz29/PM10 build????).<br><br>But anyhow, unless they are melee, they can't touch you. even if they are melee, AB should not be to high.<br><br>Good luck. Wish I had this challenge, I love finding the key to crack such locks.

heh...very good point on the neutrality, I always try to make my chars neutral as well to avoid smiting, and also to be able to use all those good/evil specific items...but theirs is an evil guild, so they're all evil PMs <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>I'm actually feeling pretty stupid that I didnt think of a smiting build earlier <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">    but I have tried a 38wiz/1rogue/1sd...I'm too used to playing melee builds though I guess and just have to learn all the spells that are unsaveable and the best order to cast etc. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Heh...my cleric build had good implosion dc, problem was I just couldnt work out how far away from myself to cast it and was very embarressed a few times when I imploded myself on the field of battle <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_redface.gif">   <br><br>A cleric/dragon build...thats 1 I havent thought of before though...sweet <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    thnx <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Hmmm...maybe I should dust of my cleric/bard/aa build as well come to think of it...that 36m/4pal reminded me of his awesome ab and buffs, and the inability to save against divine damage...cheers guys...all good advice <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By evildeath123 on 02/09/06 02:14</span></i></p>

The next patch will change implosion so It won't harm the caster *whew*, so that's going to help.<br><br>The guild he is fighting has a rule 'you must be evil',no neutral PM's there.. so smiters would work. (they are purists).<br><br>Some have items that give insane soak, and SR making them damn hard to hurt at all.<br><br>Their ac's are high 80's to as high as 98. an ab of 80 is almost unheard of there(not even aa's), in a battle of 20's they seem to win everytime I have seen. And the problem he hasn't mentioned is, Dev. Crit. is in on that server. So 1 hit and your dead, even pallys fall quick.<br><br>And like he said, these guys can't even kill each other.<br><br>Not sure There's an easy, or solid solution Death.

If they are evil, have high DR and SR, then the smiter is the way to go. I would even drop the 4 fighter levels for 4 more CoT (you lose WS/EWS, but that's only good for 6 damage, the 4 levels with Great Smite X gains you another 40 damage per smite). Pal 18/CoT 22, or Pal 20/CoT 20. You'll be doing 400 points of smite damage on a hit, plus some from base, weapon enhancement, str, divine might and divine wrath. Plus with Holy Sword you will also be dispelling their buffs or acid sheaths. Should be able to take them out with 2-3 smites.<br><br>TM

Jumped the Gun. Apologies, but thanks for the regard =)<br><br>Smite wont cut it with most Dex Based PMs anyway. Nothing worse than missing on all three smites. And 99% of all Smiters dont have true strike.<br><br>But AA's with Called Shot eat PMs (specially Dex based) to pieces. Add True Strike into that equation and you have 6 attacks (lets say 4 of them land) which means -80% movement penalty, -8 Dex, and -4 AC in the first round. It's all down hill for them there. For the Three Rounds they're speed is down, drop back to deep range, switch to Drive Cam (to stay out of there visual range so you can't get hit with spells) and just keep Called Leg Spam. Most PMs have average HP (re: 400ish) so you should finish them pretty quick.<br><br>...at least this is all in theory. But its worked for me a few times.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By plan__b on 02/18/06 20:31</span></i></p>

Sure it is, I once was fighting a dragon with an AA and slowed him so much (after like 8 to called shots leg) that with my hasted speed he couldn't touch me by miracle, every called shot leg that hit slowed him more and more, just one doesn't makes such a big change.

That should hit most things fairly often, and if the first one hits, the Holy Avenger should bring down some of their defenses. He can also Taunt effectively (high Cha, can take SF/ESF: Taunt for an unbuffed Taunt of 64, 70 with buffed CHA), so that will give him another +6 if he uses it before smiting.

If they have ~400 HP, the smite will be a 1-hit kill, 2-hit max.<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 02/20/06 03:32</span></i></p>

Apart from this Shadow Hood that grants immunity to Harm and IGMS. Are there any other items there that grant immunities, Spell Res, etc? It could help to find a solution.<br><br>Personally, it sounds like the Exalted Sorceress may be your best bet, due to the saves and casting power.<br><br>Perhaps Time Stop then Extended Bigby's Grasping Hand each of them. Then they are at your mercy:<br><br>Plenty of AoE spells to start with: Evard's Black Tentacles, Acid Fog, Cloudkill, Incendiary Cloud, Mind Fog, etc. <br><br>Of course, you may want to MD them first before you unleash your AoE spells. This may be a safer route than melee. Particularly if they have Damage Reduction items on as well.<br><br>Follow up with any of: Ice Storm, Horrid Wilting, Firebrand, Chain Lightning, Finger of Death, Flame Arrow, Acid Fog, Cloudkill.

In order to be able to kill something, you first have to understand your enemy! Knowing their strengths and how the build works will allow you to better combat them and fight to their weakness.<br><br>There are several different kinds of Palemaster...melee (sub-categories: dex / str), casters (sub-categories: clerics / mages / bards) &amp; others<br><br>Basic PM abilities:<br><br>Immunity to Critical Hits / Sneak Attack<br>+2 AC / 4 levels &amp; 1st level<br>At levels 15 PMs can learn Epic Spells, as long as they meet the spellcraft requirements.<br><br>Any class can make a PM as long as they have 3 levels of bard, wizard or sorcerer. This however greatly limits the number of different pale master builds you can make. Plus it means that you often have to sacrifice total dominance in one area for a sub-standardness with critical immunity.<br><br>Generally most Pale Master builds will stick to the Bard class as it also affords Tumble as well as UMD. So combining a 3rd class with this gives you the resulting build. This can be ANY class (apart from Shifter) however some work a lot better than others...<br><br>Melee PMs: (eg. Pally 20/Bard or Wiz 4/PM 16) <br><br>Str - These typically have less AC than other PM builds, however can easily have Dev. Crit with an AB in the 60s (WITHOUT any special items <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif"> ). Strength based also means they can have high disciplines, though will end up with less HP than a lot of other melee builds.<br><br>Dex - Worst kind of PMs...practically impossible to hit with Epic Mage Armor &amp; can have AB in the 60s depending on build...typically they have low Disciplines and low HP though when compared to other melee builds.<br><br>Casters:<br><br>Clerics (eg. Cleric 26, Bard 4, PM 10) - Thankfully a support build more than anything...designed to be in the heat of combat delivering much needed heals to allies...best to ignore! They are surprisingly effective healers, however swiftly run out of spells &amp; lose their effectiveness...<br><br>Mages (eg. Wiz or Sorc 29 / Monk 1 / PM 10) - Whew these guys can be really annoying, however due to lack of caster levels they can really lack Spell Penetration. They do have higher AC than non-PM mages however...this makes them harder to hit in Melee, however anything with a DECENT spell resistance will be able to OWN them. A high Cleric (38/1/1) handing out spell resistances (SR =50) would really aid your battle vs. these...otherwise a high Monk build works well...however in Melee you'll have to watch out for those pesky Acid Sheathes...<br><br>Bards (eg. 30 bard/10 PM 100 perform - max song) - these guys are really going to make things tough for you...the +7 AC / +2 AB song combined with Cursre song translates to +9 AC / +7 AB...plus the +11 to Skill practically eliminates any chance of IKD...throw in a <i>Wounding Whispers</i> damage shield and things are starting to look really really bad. However there is a really nice counter to all this <b>Silence</b>...the simple lvl 2 Cleric/Bard spell not only negates all Sonic damage but also prevents Curse song from having any effect. Further to that if you can get close before he sings you can even prevent the normal song aswell <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>Other PM builds:<br><br>Monk (Wiz or Sorc 4 / PM 28 / Monk <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif">  - These guys can have the highest possible AC attainable in a NWN character...however that comes at a high price...they can do little else apart from run around on steroids...<br><br>RDDs - A popular way to get high AC &amp; good abilities, however they are still combat/casting defficient<br><br>DDs - also known as the Garbabage Cans! These guys can get practically immune to combat damage...though their AB is usually too low to respond directly to threats they can easily use an Acid Sheath to fight back...<br><br>-----<br><br>As mentioned earlier you can put any class with a Pale Master...however they will generally be less powerful than another build that is natural to that class...eg. a PM Rogue would only have Pale Master levels to gain critical/sneak immunity &amp; extra AC...this is easily counterbalanced by a well built Rogue that will have much greater AB &amp; more feats! A Pally-PM can be a powerful build...but a Pally-RDD can be far greater - except it doesn't have critical/sneak immunity<br><br>That said, generally I find the most effective way to counter a Pale Master is to fight fire with fire! You just need a really good build that takes the essence of the PM build you are facing and remove the Pale Mastery...don't forget they are already limited by having to factor <b>2 Classes</b> into their build...you have the choice of 3 so can <b>ALWAYS</b> come up with a build to beat them...<br><br>....and remember just because they have Sneak Immunity it does not mean that they have the immunity to be caught flat-footed <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"><br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!

Hmm, your PW has pretty powerful item. Which skews many builds. But I think specialized Rakshasa build can do the job of killing PMs. Something like Druid5/Wiz24/Shifter11 by Sbully or Druid 29/Shifter 10/Monk 1. Personally, I think Druid/Shifter/Monk may be better suited for the job. (although it depends on what kind of immunities items grant)<br><br>Rakshasa shape will give you...<br>+5 Staff (20/x2), 1d10 fire<br>True Seeing<br>+2 Universal Save<br>DR 15/+5 (which in this case isn't important)<br>Knockdown, dodge (ditto)<br>Unlimited casting of...<br>Dispell (could be useful against some PM builds)<br>Mestil's Acid Breath (meh)<br>Ice Storm (Woot!)<br>Discipline +5, Hide +10, Move Silently +11, Spellcraft +15, Spot +10<br><br>And...(drum roll) IMMUNITY TO SPELLS FROM LVL 0 to 8!!<br><br>Remember also that all of unlimited casting spells use your druid (or any caster lvl combined) to calculate your damage, DC, etc. Also you can maximize/empower Ice storm and by quick slotting it, you can cast it in Rakshasa form. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>By having Druid lvl of 29, you will also get added benefits. Like SR of 41 with Spell resistance spell.<br><br>Tactics: Extend all your buffs and cast prior to entering combat area. It should last you quite sometime. Open with some spells that have no save (since +50 to skill items and such give ridiculous saves against spells). Like, extended Inferno (2d6 fire/rnd) or just maximized/empowerd Ice storm. Sun burst is also great opener too. If you get lucky and they fail Reflex save, they will be permanently blinded (till they remove with use of magic).<br><br>Remember also that you can cast epic spells while in Rakshasa form, if you've taken any.<br><br>Chiibo

The Rakshasa idea's not bad, as long as they don't cast Bigby's Crushing Hand (or if you cast Spell Resistance and their caster level is too low to beat it).<br><br>FYI, the Rakshasa spell casting level will be equal to the class level of your first class (whichever class you take at level 1). So if you plan to rely on Ice Storm damage, use the Druid 29 build and start as a druid.<br><br>Don't bother with inferno - since it's only 2d6 per round, any item with +10/fire or more will pretty much stop all of it.

I second the exhaulted sorc type build, or even a Sorc27/PM12/Rogue1 type build.  Are you against using a PM build too?<br><br>Without +20 weapons, you will NOT hit someone with 80-90AC with your smites, and you will never penetrate Epic Warding either!<br><br>*YES, SMITES are PHYSICAL damage, not Divine.  I have a guy that smites a critical hit for 1000 damage, and it is physical.*  I also thought it would be divine, but I was wrong.<br><br>You are not going to get a melee build with weak weapons, and high AC items to kill a high AC build, unless there is no REGEN items, and you are both just waiting on 20's.  That is why a spellcaster is best.<br><br>Truely though, high AC items + Epic Warding not nerfed + no high +AB weapons = totally unbalanced server.  Sounds like a server soon full of PM's only!

The best strategy would probably be to just hit them on a 20roll with a Holy Avenger if you can live that long, strip them of buffs before you attempt smites.<br><br>These are the reasons why I suggested a caster as well, because the AC won't be relevant.

IF the CHA bonus to smite doesn't count towards the +20 cap the best theoretical smite AB I've managed to come up with is using pally/sorc/rdd.  You sacrifice a few greater smites (down to 6/7) but you can get a higher AB.  A quick run up of it shows approx. 26/28 STR/CHA, and AB of about 42ish.  With truestrike you can hit the +20 cap to hit 62 ab, with +12 STR (unlikely I guess) you have 68 ab, with +12 CHA (more likely with pally buffs) you get 40 CHA so 83 AB on a smite.  This is a horrible build for anything else though.

Hahaha, bro I have the same problem as you do, well sort of. In the PvP I play in,the mages are a bunch of ***'s who only use Finger of Death. I found that Cleric is actually the best way to go to deal with them. See, Clerics have a certain spell, don't remember the level but it's a low one, called Negative Energy Protection. NEP turns away all death attacks, and if your PW server has taken off imunties don't worry, because this spell will still keep you alive from that pesky FoD.<br>_________________<br>You can't kill what was simply never there. . .
