That's a pretty good description of one of the servers I play on. Check sig. And the server can be found under action, name: Dragonlance server.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

You could always try the Wheel of Time: Third Age server.  It's a very complicated setting, especially if you haven't read the books, by Robert Jordan (The Wheel of Time, 12 book series).<br><br>But, it seemed to fit all of your needs, except restrictions on leveling spread... the only restrictions on such is limits on PM/RDD use (faction pre-reqs.) and also a minimum of 3 Shadowdancer levels.<br><br>Fairly populated, though.  <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "5336", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Here's</a> the link to the guild if you wish to check it out.  It is a non-CEP server, but recently there's been a vote and they may place in CEP2 soon (within several months, possibly not till the end of this year).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By mantis3 on 04/11/07 20:45</span></i></p>

Thanks for the replies, I have no problem with those level restrictions, those are fair enough, it's more like "Monks may not multiclass" or "you must have a total of 10 in each class by level 30" that's a problem.

Athas Reborn in PW Story is where I have played for the last few years. RP heavy and encouraged, but no rules regarding OOC except in talk and shout. Dozens of quests. Easy leveling for those who ask how. All gear and baddies custom made and within the range you mentioned with three rare and notable exceptions. No PRC. Set in the Darksun game world of ADND2'nd edition; a cross between Tolkien and Fallout. Evil epic wizards destroyed the planet and are fighting over the scraps. You are in the middle of that struggle.
