You're going to run into alignment issues with those two classes (babrs can't be lawful, and DD has to be). Barring that, you could mix in paladin, CoT, or BG for some saving throw boosts. I think Anuis has a build based on that concept though.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>
