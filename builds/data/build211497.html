Now this is a build I've been sitting on for a while and was surpirsed to find that it is unique!

Nice build. I have a similar build on the PW Amon.

6 str is pretty hard for an autostill build.  I'd suggest adding some more str.<br><br>you need to be able to carry your fullplate and medium sheild, but I'm not sure you'll be able to with only 6 str without a bull's spell being cast.  One dispell will probably encumber you as well if you need bull's to wear your equipment.

Full plate weighs 50.0 lbs &amp; str 6 allows 60.0 lbs...this gives u 10.0 lbs to play with...however it is usually possible to pick up some strength enhancing items (gauntlets of ogre power for instance), without the need for buffs.... + equip yourself with a few bags of holding and we are away!<br><br>The build was never intended for hand to hand combat anyway so i'd be using a wizard staff anyway.<br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!

Why give up free AC?  You can always switch to a staff temporarily if you want to use it for a spell.  In which case, your STR is indeed way too low for an auto-stiller.  You should not have to buff or get strength boosting items just to wear your basic clothing.  <br><br>Personally, I find the INT extremely low for a pure caster.  Even with epic spell focus in evocation, you're going to have a hard time using spells that require a saving throw with INT that low, not to mention the fact that you're limiting your spell slots on a build that only has casting as its offense.  9/- doesn't really seem like an adequate compensation for that.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 09/07/05 22:59</span></i></p>

It's impossible to dispel a character with this many caster levels.  The strongest dispeller in the game, Mordenkainen's Disjunction, has a a dispel check of caster level + 1d20, but to a maximum caster level of 20.  So, 40 is the highest you can roll.  The DC is 11 + the caster level of the person you're dispelling.  So, 30 levels of a caster class is enough to make the DC impossible to reach.  The breach/disjunction effects still work, but those only strip a subset of spells that does not include basic stat buffs.  His Bull's Strength would be untouchable.  Still seems a bit too low if you have to use it to just carry what you're wearing, but at least he doesn't have to worry about losing his boost too.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 09/07/05 23:17</span></i></p>

I don't know if the 'beating to death' on my shields was the strategy I was aiming for...more like Maximized Ice storms with practically the highest damage possible...&amp; flame arrow...even a nice empowered finger of death which would deal a minimum of 59 negative damage assuming the save was made...maybe timestop, summon IX then a variety of offensive spells?<br><br>Cheers Steve tho...I have made a few refinements now and it seems to be working a lot better <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"><br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!

You choose it based on the school that you would lose access to by specializing.  Other than the minor spell craft benefits, the real meat and potatoes of specialization is that you get an extra spell per day per spell level.  So, as long as you can afford to lose a school of magic, it's worth it.  Going Illusionist costs you the Enchantment school, which I, like krsboss apparently, find an easy school to forget about, and well worth the trade off.  I almost always go with Illusionist (unless I do something else for RP reasons), as the extra spells per day are extremely handy.<br><br>Steve

I understand perfectly your reason to specialized, it was just a small funny thing I couldn't let pass <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Otherwise, with a better INT it seems a lot more stronger now. <br><br>Now as you noticed, the paladin lvl is maybe not that needed with only the heavy armor prof. and +1 to save, a lvl of fighter might get you a free bonus feat at the cost of the +1 to saves (unbuffed). It gives you the oppotunity to get the greater spell focus: evocation or extend (or expertise + improved version if you remove thougness) or anything you like.<br><br>As for the order of the feats taken, I would take later the following feats:<br><br>- thougness (at lvl 1 it only gives you +1 HP)<br>- still spell (you can't wear an heavy armor until lvl20)<br>- maximize (at lvl 5 you can only max the cantrips <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  )<br>- great INT (I tend to take the "useful" feats before ability increases, but it is just me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  )<br><br>and earlier the following ones:<br><br>- focus: evoc. (you get really nice evoc spells at lvl5)<br>- automatic still spells (ASAP to be able to really use your armor)<br>- epic spell focus/penetration<br>- epic spells<br><br>Hope it helps,<br>aquamoeba

I like to take toughness as early as possible...preferably at either 1st or 3rd as after 3rd level you start having to roll for hit points...*coughs* This makes it easier to know what you have to roll if for instance you were going to be rerolling HP every level <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"><br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!

@Lego,<br>of course you get +1 HP each lvl but what I mean is that thougness at lvl 1 gives you an advantage of 1 HP. Not that important at that lvl. Now take it later, at lvl20 per example and you get +20HP, that means it is now a bigger advantage. The point is to choose the feats you need the most or can get the most advantage at your current lvl.<br><br>@Stravinsky,<br>Yes indeed, I wasn't very clear. I meant that you could swap the "toughness" feat in the fighter bonus slot and take the previous "thougness" slot for another feat. But now, I not sure you can take thougness as a bonus feat (Actually I am pretty sure you can't, silly me).<br><br>Still the option of expertise/imp expertise is still open.<br><br>aquamoeba

I agree that paladin should go. It looks to me like you put 4 points into charisma on creation just to get a +1 to saves. Put those points in strength or constitution instead and go with fighter to pick up expertise, I'd swap one of the other feats for imp expertise too I think, it's a much cheaper path to ac than auto-still.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By pulse cap on 09/20/05 12:36</span></i></p>

OK, I guess still spell is much better suited to a spell sword than a straight caster...so dropping Still Spell &amp; Auto Still Spell I/II/III, frees up 4 feats, these can be put into an extra 2 Great Intelligence, one pre-epic can go into Greater Spell Focus: Evocation...with extra Epic feat going into Epic Spell: Greater Ruin or Epic Spell Focus: Evocation.<br><br>Dropping Paladin level frees 4 stat. points, these can go into Con to get it to starting 18...but what class to take extra level in? Not much point taking Fighter as bonus feat is a combat feat &amp; only point of Paladin was for Divine Grace &amp; Heavy Armour proficiency...putting spare level into Wizard wouldn't yeild any extra feats but would give extra damage on Ice-Storm, maybe Barbarian for a bit of punk-factor!<br>_________________<br>Grrr...hear my roar!!!
