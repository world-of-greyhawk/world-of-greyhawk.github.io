Strangely enough there's no such combo in the search engine. Nothing really unusual in this build though; it's a high lvl Ranger with BoE and a fair amount of FEs (7), STR based, can wear Hide armor and still keep a 30 AC with just a +4 DEX (lucky Cat's Grace or Cat's Grace and minor DEX gear) for dual wielding capability, has fair saves with a nice boost vs spells, good AB and ok AB dual wielding, medium HPs, UMD and Taunt as class skills, trap setting skills and a good listen, all the basic combat feats and a weak Bard song 4/day on top. <br><br>It fares well as all good rangers and even more so because of added bard versatility and CoT save boosting<br><br>Dropping starting STR to 14 and raising CON to 14 is an option, in this case also drop one Great STR for another feat of your choice (ESF: Discipline or Taunt is my suggestion). Getting some points in animal empathy too will help during the lower lvls.<br><br>For those that want Dev Crit: there's definitely room for it, drop one feat preepic and 2 FEs in epic for Great Cleave, Ov. Crit. and Dev. Crit. and there you go.<br><br><br>******************************<br><br><br><b><i>Champion of the Wilds - Ranger(26), Champion of Torm(10), Bard(4)</i></b><br>Human, any non lawful, non evil<br><i>PvM, Playable 1-40</i><br><br><br><br><b>ABILITIES (ending)</b><br>STR: 15 (32)<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br><br><b>STATS SUMMARY</b><br>Hitpoints: 464<br>Skillpoints: 281<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 29/27/28<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8<br>BAB: 29<br>AB: 44 (melee), 42 (dual wielding), 32 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/armor and shield): 22/30<br>Spell Casting: Ranger(4)<br>Spell slots: 4/4/3/3<br><br><br><b>SKILLS</b><br>Discipline 43(54)<br>Listen 40(42)<br>Perform 10(9)<br>Set Trap 33(35)<br>Spellcraft 38(40)<br>Taunt 41(40)<br>Tumble 40(42)<br>UMD 36(35)<br>no points leftover<br><br><br><b>LEVELING GUIDE</b><br>01: Ranger(1): Weapon Proficiency Exotic, Weapon Focus: Kukri, Favored Enemy I, {Dual Wield}<br>02: Ranger(2)<br>03: Bard(1): Power Attack<br>04: Ranger(3): STR+1, (STR=16)<br>05: Ranger(4)<br>06: Ranger(5): Cleave, Favored Enemy II<br>07: Ranger(6)<br>08: Ranger(7): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>09: Ranger(8): Knockdown<br>10: Ranger(9): {Improved Two-Weapon Fighting}<br>11: Champion of Torm(1)<br>12: Champion of Torm(2): STR+1, Blind Fight, Improved Critical, (STR=18)<br>13: Bard(2)<br>14: Champion of Torm(3): {Smite Evil}<br>15: Champion of Torm(4): Iron Will, Improved Knockdown<br>16: Ranger(10): STR+1, Favored Enemy III, (STR=19)<br>17: Ranger(11)<br>18: Ranger(12): Toughness<br>19: Ranger(13)<br>20: Ranger(14): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>21: Ranger(15): Great Strength I, Favored Enemy IV, (STR=21)<br>22: Champion of Torm(5)<br>23: Champion of Torm(6): Epic Weapon Focus: Kukri<br>24: Bard(3): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=23)<br>25: Ranger(16)<br>26: Ranger(17)<br>27: Ranger(18): Great Strength III, (STR=24)<br>28: Ranger(19): STR+1, (STR=25)<br>29: Ranger(20): Favored Enemy V<br>30: Ranger(21): Great Strength IV, (STR=26)<br>31: Ranger(22)<br>32: Ranger(23): STR+1, Bane of Enemies, (STR=27)<br>33: Champion of Torm(7): Great Strength V, (STR=28)<br>34: Champion of Torm(8): Armor Skin<br>35: Champion of Torm(9)<br>36: Champion of Torm(10): STR+1, Great Strength VI, Epic Prowess, (STR=30)<br>37: Ranger(24)<br>38: Ranger(25): Favored Enemy VI<br>39: Ranger(26): Great Strength VII, Favored Enemy VII, (STR=31)<br>40: Bard(4): STR+1, (STR=32)<br><br><br>******************************<br><br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><b>•</b>Good melee AB<br><b>•</b>Fair AC in light armor<br><b>•</b>Dual wielding<br><b>•</b>BoE with 7FEs<br><b>•</b>A useful animal companion<br><b>•</b>fair saves, even more so vs spells<br><b>•</b>Taunt<br><b>•</b><b>UMD</b><br><b>•</b>Trap setting skills<br><b>•</b>Rangers spells<br><b>•</b>4th lvl Bard song available<br><b>•</b>Dev Crit implementable<br><br><br><i>Weaknesses</i><br><b>•</b>Low HPs for a meleer<br><b>•</b>Tight on skillpoints<br><b>•</b>Ranger's spellbook<br><b>•</b>BoE doesn't come so early<br><b>•</b>not a dwarf<br><br><br><br>****************************** <br><br><br>Feedback and constructive criticism are, as usual, gladly appreciated.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Stand and fight, live by your heart<br>Always one more try, I'm not afraid to die<br>Stand and fight, say what you feel<br>Born with a Heart of Steel!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 09/26/06 16:57</span></i></p>

It's a solid build.  It's nice to see that not all melee builds feel like they have to plate up like a can of tuna.  I've come more and more to appreciate a dex in the 16 to 18 range for a str based melee character.  It may sacrifice a point or two of AB &amp; damage, but you get enormous flexibility in how you deck out your character as you can get the same AC in either medium or heavy armor, enchantments being equal.<br>_________________<br>In order to find his equal, an Irishman is forced to talk to<br>God.

I am gone and you build an epic ranger. Nice job. The CoT covers some of the worst weaknesses of ranger-heavy builds, namly saves. It's at the expense of damage or something though.<br><br>The CBC is making you lazy. f.ex.: instead of spellcasting: Ranger (4) it should be ranger: 4/4/3/3.

Ranger easyly goes this route: dual wielding means a higher dmg output and forces light armor use and Cat's Grace is there as a class spell, lowering the base DEX value needed. The "stealth" spells help with sneaking, compensating for the lower DEX in a STR build. Overall, sweet.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 09/26/06 09:07:04 (GMT) -- Grimnir77<br><br>I am gone and you build an epic ranger. Nice job.

Also, the Primeveal Ranger has right that class split. I'd say it's a good tradeoff, better saves and no worries for XP penalties whatsoever are things not to be turned down lightly.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;The CBC is making you lazy. f.ex.: instead of spellcasting: Ranger (4) it should be ranger: 4/4/3/3.

*steeples hands*  eeexcellent.<br><br>i have been thinking of something similar.  the only thing that i lament is that while the saves are better, they are still not amazing.  probably good enough with gear, or against magic, but still...it just bugs me.  how can a hardy ranger not have hardy saves?  well, 3.5 fixes it a little bit i suppose.  don't mind my ramblings though.  a strong ranger, to be sure.<br><br>-cs
