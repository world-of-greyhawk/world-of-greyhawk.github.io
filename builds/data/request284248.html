You can get more attacks per round with a Monk, a dual-wielder Fighter would make up to 6 while a single-wielding Monk can make up to 7, dual-wielding monk makes 9, add Haste and you get 10, which is the max APR.<br><br>I think you're asking a bit too much though, you can't have a Weapon Master / Rogue / Cleric sneaker/buffer/dual-wielder and rock almighty, no, you will lack both feats and stats with such build, an <b>intensive</b> lack of feats.<br><br>I would recommend you to either drop sneak or drop buffs. If you drop sneak you can take maybe Fighter to grab feats and it will definitely work. If you drop the buffing part you can still use some scrolls and stuff thanks to Rogue's UMD, you will also need some extra feats here, Fighter is the best for that IMO.<br><br>If you were interested on Monk max APR the easiest choice would be to drop Weapon Master.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

You need Ambidexterity and Two Weapon Fighting to reduce it to -4/-4, but since using a double weapon gives you advantage, when you use a two-bladed sword you actually get -4/-8 without feats and -2/-2 if you take the feats. Besides that Improved Two Weapon Fighting adds a second attack per round on your ofhand at -5 AB (a must take for any dual-wielder, pre-requirements are Ambidexterity and Two Weapon Fighting).<br><br>That maks it 3 feats and minimum 15 DEX as pre-requirement for Ambidexterity and add that the 5 feat requirement to be a Weapon Master, you just won't do without Fighter or Champion of Torm to pick extra feats. Know that taking a two-bladed sword without any dual-wielding feats is probably the worse weapon scenario you can pick.<br><br>If you only want True Strike then you don't really "buff up", just pick a scroll of True Strike and use it with UMD (Rogue). Fighter / Weapon Master / Rogue is a good build, try the <a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">build searcher</a>.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 10/02/07 02:08</span></i></p>

That leaves you with a str build. <br>Normally you will need dex 15 to get ambidexterity. Spending that much on dex in a str build is expensive. and you get little in return. <br>There is one exception, and that is taking dual wield as a ranger. Then you get ambidexterity as part of the dual-wield package with no dex requirements. The down side is that you have to wear light armor, or dual wield wont work. The obvious workaround is to use dex items so you can reach dex 18 for a studded, dex 22 for a leather or dex 26 for a padded armor. Any build can reach dex 18 with items. You will need a base dex of at least 10 to be able to reach dex 22 with items, and a base dex of 14 to be able to reach dex 26 with items.<br><br>Any build with a UMD class (rogue, bard, assassin) can self buff with scrolls.<br>A build with between 8 and 15 cleric lvls (econo cleric) will be a great self buffer.<br>Scrolls of true strike grant a great AB bonus, but are very short lived (9 sec) meaning you spend much of your precious fighting time reading scrolls.<br><br>A str build will have weaker stealth skills than a dedicated dex build, but can manage quite well in several environments.<br><br>Going fighter in full plate is probably the easiest way to build a double weapon wielder. Just remember to take TWF, Ambidexterity and ITWF. Epic weapon specialization adds considerably to the damage.<br><br>Adding a tumble class will compensate to some degree for not being able to use a shield. (rogue or assassin is great here for both UMD and tumble)<br><br>A ranger build with enough ranger lvls to get bane of enemies can also punch quite well. In a ranger build (light armor) I would definitely add a class that gives uncanny dodge (shadowdancer, rogue, assassin, barbarian).<br><br>My favourite here is the ranger/shadowdancer and the ranger/assassin types of builds.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

The nice thing about two-bladed swords is the double bang on buffs etc., so yeah, it makes total sense if willing to go arcanist as opposed to a sneaker to build w. a wiz, sorc., cleric and/or paladin (what, no one recommends paladin anymore? 25 Ranger/15 Paladin: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "276571", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>  <br><br>No umd in terms of versatility, which some may find frustrating, but w. all that wholesome natural BAB/AB and saves/pally immunities, w. pally buffs for more, together with STR-based, full bane/FE and pally-buff charged damage, mix in that double avenger (holy sword), and makes for a straight up, no nonsense damage dealing melee'r w. nice saves (and dispels good, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good [people] to do nothing" -- Edmund Burke, Philosopher and Politician (1729-1797)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 10/02/07 15:16</span></i></p>
