Hi everybody. First post here and looking for advice.<br><br>I'm trying to make a caster build for a roleplay PW. The idea behind the build is to be able to handle most situations by myself, but also be an asset in groups. Most of the combat is gonna be PvM, but there's certainly some PvP, and I'd like to be somewhat decent at it too (or at least to have a build that is potentially decent, being my control over it the limitant factor).<br><br>The server could be classified as a medium magic world. There are no inmunity items around (or very few and only conceded by RP merits), nor perma-haste or true seeing items, but there are many standard palette items which boost skills, stats and saves. Also crafting is very rewarding. Through crafting and imbuition, it is possible to create magical armors with up to +10  AC, +6 to stats and +4 to saves, and weapons up to +8 enhancement. Thus It is very easy to achieve +12 in your primary stat. This build cannot craft however, as there are certain consecuences for making a character able to create items the build is not intended for.<br><br>I favor, due my playstyle, un-armored builds able to sneak decently, but I'm open to suggestions. What I've done so far is the typical caster build, focused in a couple of schools, and get as many different combat oriented skills as I could. I like somewhat high spell DCs and AC, just like everybody I guess.<br><br>Finally, some limitations. Any chosen class has to be at least 5 levels by level 40. Shadowdancers have to level up the first 5 levels consecutively. Certain overpowering combinations are forbidden: Bard/PM and Monk/Druid. Having stats lower than 10 is permitted, but frowned upon (in the case of a wizard, 8 STR is okay, but WIS and CHA would not make that much sense). Also, since this is a caster build, I should mention Isaac's have been nerfed to 10 missile/person cap. These rules apply to everybody, of course.<br><br>Here is the build I have. I'd appreciate any suggestion, from minor to radical changes, it doesn't matter as long as they are in the line of what I've written before.<br><br><b>Wizard 30/Rogue 5/SD 5</b><br>Race: Human (NE)<br><br><b>Attributes</b><br><br>STR:   8<br>INT:   18 (34)<br>WIS:  10<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 12<br>CHA: 10<br><br><b>Leveling Guide</b><br><br>1 Wizard (1) Toughness, Expertise<br>2 Wizard (2)<br>3 Wizard (3) Improved Expertise<br>4 Wizard (4) Int +1 (19)<br>5 Wizard (5) Spell Focus: Necromancy<br>6 Wizard (6) Spell Focus: Enchantment<br>7 Wizard (7)<br>8 Rogue (1), Int +1 (20)<br>9 Wizard (8), Extend Spell<br>10 Wizard (9), Maximize Spell<br>11 Wizard (10)<br>12 Wizard (11), Greater Spell Focus: Necromancy, Int +1 (21)<br>13 Wizard (12)<br>14 Wizard (13)<br>15 Wizard (14), Dodge<br>16 Wizard (15), Greater Spell Focus: Enchantment, Int +1 (22)<br>17 Wizard (16)<br>18 Wizard (17), Still Spell<br>19 Rogue (2)<br>20 SD (1), Int +1 (23)<br>21 SD (2), Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy<br>22 SD (3)<br>23 SD (4)<br>24 SD (5), Greater Spell Focus: Enchantment, Int24<br>25 Wizard (18)<br>26 Wizard (19)<br>27 Wizard (20), Great Intelligence I, II (25,26)<br>28 Rogue (3), Int +1 (27)<br>29 Wizard (21)<br>30 Wizard (22), Epic Mage Armor<br>31 Wizard (23), Epic Warding<br>32 Rogue (4), Int +1 (28)<br>33 Wizard (24), Great Intelligence III (29)<br>34 Wizard (25)<br>35 Wizard (26), Great Int IV (30)<br>36 Wizard (27), Great Int V (31), Int +1(32)<br>37 Rogue (5)<br>38 Wizard (28)<br>39 Wizard (29), Greater Ruin, Great Intelligence VI (33)<br>40 Wizard (30), Int +1 (34)<br><br><br><b>Combat Vitals:</b> ( ) = buffed, no items<br><br>AB: +18/+13 (+20/+15)<br>AC: 22 (49) +1 (Dodge) +10 (Imp.

ESF: Enchantment, I'm not so sure. Certain spells are quite useful, such as hold/dominate person/monster and confusion, but I don't know if they are worth 3 feats. I used to get Evocation focus instead, but it 'seems' Bigby spells no longer account for those feats when calculating their grasp? I don't know any other Evocation spells useful (Flame Arrow for mantle breaking) that need the focus. I might start another topic to discuss wizard tactics, since I'm in dire need to review them, specially since the latest patches changed things while I was away.<br><br><br>As a post scriptum, in the PW I play some classes can gain certain benefits with levels. I only know Wizards get a free teleport spell at level 3 (which is a quite nice get-away spell) and Rangers get HiPS at level 17. I'm gonna confirm this and check if there are any other changes of interest.<br><br>Anyhow, if there's anything else you need to know just ask. Thanks in advance!

Well, initally:<br><br>I would strongly advise going ranger instead of rogue, rp'd as a woodsman who stumbled upon a wizards hut, much like some of the original king arthur stories.<br>rgr will allow for discipline, which is always nice.<br><br>Tactics wise, on a RP server, either play it smart, or nuke things <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> .

I'd drop rogue completely and go 35 wizard/5 shadowdancer.

Ranger at least allows for a disc. dump, but yeah, you're right.
