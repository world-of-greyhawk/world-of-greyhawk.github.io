I will edit this post later tonight with the pulse cap search (i can browse pulse cap on my phone but not copy and paste to here).  There is only one build remotely similar to this, Nimueh_Leafbow's "The Shadow's Breath" D20/Ro13/M7 but the only similarities are reasonably close class levels as his/her build focus' on finesse + air elemental.<br><br>I borrowed heavily from Thaxll'ssyllia's druid guide (which I've been unable to find again), especially the Conjuration focus' and stonehold/sov thoughts.  I also borrowed from a suggestion/comment on another build I can't remember, I think it was Avado or cdaulepp(sp?) talking about sneak attacks on SOV.  I also borrowed indirectly from several of Kael's builds and comments since I've read like 35 dragon build posts / comments of his on other dragon builds.<br><br>Now I can't do sneak attacks I'm assuming if it lasts a round (take too long for me to shift) but I assume stonehold would generate sneak attacks for me like kd/ikd?)<br><br>I called this build the perfect combatant not because I think its a perfect build or remotely close but more because he unifies excellent casting with excellent melee can stealth (theoretically I'm sure dragons get penalties (-8?)) has sneak attacks and a very strong knockdown, can handle groups and also 1v1, and probably other things I haven't thought of.<br><br>I haven't tested it in the building module but according to the CBC spreadsheet it's all legal.  I will test it tonight when I get home from work and also post the buffed stats and the shape shifted stats etc as I'm not sure how to figure all those out.<br><br>This is my first attempt to post an "epic build" i have a build in general forum that is currently taking comments but I think this one is better.  I'm sure there is probably some magic you guys can work in terms of switching what levels/feats are taken where and I would love to hear those comments as well as anything else.<br><br><br>Human, LN (No Smites)<br>&lt;PvM/PvP&gt;, Playable 6-40 PVM/PVP (Between druid casting and shape shifting / Call Lightning.

Since the main goal is to avoid getting into melee when unshifted all the extra skills are far more useful imo.  I.E.

I'd drop improved critical and empower spell.  Take Greater Spell Focus and Improved Expertise pre-epic, take Epic Prowess in epic instead of GFS.  Drop defensive roll for crippling strike.

Your note mentions IE but I only see you taking expertise....<br><br>If I were playing this build, I would take INT of 14 and boost Con to 14 just to help you survive ranged and spell attacks in human form on early levels. <br><br>I would also consider taking the monk level earlier like 13th so that you get your wisdom AC earlier especially if you intend to fight in wildshape. <br><br>You could maybe push the rogue level to epics to increase your preepic BAB from 13 to 14...I always find dragon builds to suffer on the AB.  You've got more skill points than you need already and its not much of a sacrifice.<br><br>But again nice build.  There's some real synergy between sneak attack and all the flatfooted goodness from SOV and Stonehold.

I can see dropping empowered spell I really won't need it for all that much.  Actually might drop extend spell instead because empowered aoe spells are nice.

I pushed the monk level to 21 and voila +1 bab very nice!  And I did lose improved expertise while I was shifting feats around.  i didn't even notice till you said that thank you.  Now I have to figure out what to change.  <br><br>I see your points on making it easier to level but I don't know if its my PW or what I find it ridiculously easy to level and not get touched.  I can literally just call lightning over and over and then rest so I'd rather max out my 20+ levels then worry about 1-10.  I'm not sure what to do about improved expertise.  I may take the earlier suggestions of dropping empower (or maybe extend) to put it back in.  doh <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   But this is good this is what i wanted to see.<br><br>Thanks!

IMO your spot and/or listen should be maxed to see a decent rogue or SD. Far to easy to get high Hide for sure then what spot you have. Listen however is another option you could focus on if you can't max both because it a bit more difficult to get high Move Silent then it is Hide.<br><br>EDIT: But then again your Human so your chances of detecting a sneak before they attack is slim?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cainsdefeat on 07/16/09 19:21</span></i></p>

Nash -- swapped out 2 more druid levels for rogue levels (I had swapped 1 rogue down already) and got another +1 bab.  My pre-epic bab with 16 druid 4 rogue is 15.

Thanks!  That guide is an inspiration! I wanted to reread it again and see if I could make any changes to my build that I had forgotten from reading your guide.<br><br>In regards to IKD -- I read the feat again.  <br><br>A character with this feat counts as one size category larger when he <b>makes a knockdown attack</b>. All other knockdown conditions still apply.<br><br>I looked at the size category and it goes up to gargantuan (dragon is huge according to dragon shape).<br><br>testing in the module with knockdown and improved knockdown IKD always gives a +2 bonus regardless of the size creature I attack against.  I.E. Against another dragon KD was 40 IDK was 42 So I got a +2 bonus for being 1 size larger.<br><br>whether that's worth it or not compared to another feat I don't know but I'd love it if you'd test it out and confirm if I'm correct.

Hmmmmmm, as far as I remember, Knockdown will always have a penalty to hit, and given the dragon's size that penalty was already minimized as would be ridiculous that IKD could actually end giving a bonus to your AB if you fought a small enough enemy... perhaps it was changed on the new version? or maybe I'm crazy.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Knockdown does not give an AB bonus anymore.  Dragon Shape does, however, have hidden +6 claws.

I'm not sure what was happening I don't pretend to understand the mechanics to that level yet.  I just know I tested it and vs same size or lower guys KD and IKD produce different end rolls.  Whenever it used claws they were different by 2 (as one would expect from 1 size difference higher) when it used bite it was a lot lower (probably the loss in claws +6).  Test it and let me know!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Also the way its worded makes me think it works the way my testing seems to support but of course wiki could be wrong or I could be misinterpreting it.  I would love to have someone else test for sure.<br><br>Where's Kael!  I always see him testing this stuff out like ESF etc lol

Little comment on True Seeing and Spot/Listen: Even in modules/servers where TS is changed (usually to provide a bonus to Spot/Listen + Ultravision and See Invis) the True Seeing from the creature skins works as Bioware's TS. So Wyrmling, Rakshasa, Dragons, etc still get to see Stealthy-types, as long as the module hasn't changed the creature skins (as far as I know). Listen and Spot are still useful because you need to see them pesty rogues while in human form if you want to cast spells at them.

So a dragon performing an improved knockdown on a tiny creature should get -4AB and +16 (or 20 from size - 4 standard penalty) to the discipline check.

I'm aware <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   But in the past, you'd get a massive AB bonus.
