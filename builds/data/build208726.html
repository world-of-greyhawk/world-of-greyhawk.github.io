Thi is my first ever build, I wanted to have a dual wielding character with good spellcasting capability.  I like the extra armour added by RDD<br>and the free feats for dual wield added by the ranger class.  I have found character building hard so any pointers on how you would change this build to make it better would be appreciated.  <br><br>NOTE:  This is not a finished build!

I would drop wis to 8 and raise int to 10, possibly even more int at the expense of something else. As a sorcerer you should at least max concentration and spellcraft, I'd try to get discipline too.<br><br>Another thing, you didn't take a favored enemy at ranger lvl 10 as far as I can see. I'd probably use the ranger bonus feats for epic combat feats, perhaps imp weapon focus and armor skin.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By pulse cap on 08/16/05 12:15</span></i></p>

You have chosen a tricky class combo with few synergies. But I'll give you extra style bonus for originality. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"> <br><br>This class combo with some spellcasting and some melee focus will never be best at any of them. But you can do fairly well in a low magic world.<br><br>You want to dual wield. In that case get 9 lvls of Ranger ASAP for ITWF. <br>You also want 10 lvls of RDD ASAP for the added bonuses.<br>And you want Sorc lvls early to cast spells.<br>You can get a high enough BAB for 4 attacks + 2 offhand attacks/ round.<br>And you want an AC bonus.<br>It's hard if not impossible to get all.<br><br>The build focuses on dex, but with added RDD str bonus. Weapon finesse (for kukris) will improve the melee AB.<br><br>You have a high AC bonus from dex, but you have no uncanny dodge. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cry.gif">  So make sure you never get cought by surprise <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br>You like the AC bonus from RDD. You will get the same bonus (+4) over again if you cross class tumble (to 20). Tumble above 14 will save you the spring attack feat(and perhaps dodge &amp; mobility?).<br><br>I suggest you take Ranger9/RDD8/Sorc3 at lvl 20. This will give you BAB 16 and 4 + 2 attacks per round. Get RDD 10 at lvl 22. Get Sorc 20 at lvl 39 and add the 10th Ranger lvl at lvl 40 for maxed discipline.<br>The spellcasting matures late, and you'll have to live as a fighter type with lvl 1 buffs, scrolls and wands early on. <br>Later you'll get plenty of buffs, attack spells and utility spells. To get your lvl 9 Sorc spells you have to add a point to cha somewhere. As a caster you'll have problems attacking enemies with spell resistance and high saves. You'll also have problems with high lvl casters trying to dispell all your buffs. <br><br>If you want epic warding, you'll need at least 21 lvls of Sorc and a high enough spellcraft rank (34). The last chance to take this feat is the regular feat at lvl 39. It is possible with a Ranger9/RDD10/Sorc21 build. But you'll have to take your 9th Ranger lvl or your 10th RDD lvl at lvl 40. IMO this delays the ITWF or the RDD bonuses too much if you're playing the lvls.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

Your starting stats won't work. By starting at level 1 as a Ranger, the game will force you to set your WIS at 11.<br><br>I would suggest, instead of Ranger to get the 'free' dual-wield feats, you go with FTR.

Thanks a lot everyone, plenty to think about.  I think I agree on taking fighter levels instead of ranger, the extra feats would alow the dual wield and they would be kept in heavy armour, although this would cause some problem spell casting, would have to try and fit in the still spell feats perhaps... anyway, as i say thanks very much <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

you can also just take a sorc level at lvl 1 to fix the starting stats problem.

I concur with the fighter over ranger arguement. This will allow you to go mostly STR based wear heavier armor, and work twards potentially getting autoquicken feats for casting in that armor without spell failure. You can do this by possibly taking a lot less fighter levels. Another option would be to start as a sorcerer and then go RDD when available and work in some CoT levels instead of ranger or fighter levels. There is a bit more class synergy that way, as well as better durability.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>
