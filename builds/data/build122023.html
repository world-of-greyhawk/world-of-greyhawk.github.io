<b>Playable from level 1 - 40  ..PvM Build</b><br><br>Dwarven Skald<br><br>Requires alignment changes, but really, I've always thought the whole non-lawful bard thing is a joke.<br><br>Anyway, the dwarven skald....<br><br>Tired of getting pummeled to death as a non-defender?<br><br>Laughed at as a defender, because you hit like a limp wristed girl?<br><br>Love to sing, or at least let our a warcry?<br><br>Enter in the multi-faceted dwarven skald. A dwarf who loves to sing, and beat things too. And unlike the pansy praying clerics, doesn't get dispelled and cry to his god.<br><br>(I hate giving lvl up plans lvl by lvl, and this build is more about flexibility, the first route allows for more curse songs, and the second allows for the all powerful devastating critical if you like.)<br><br>Starting stats:<br>dwarf<br>str 14<br>dex 14<br>con 16<br>wis 8<br>int 14<br>cha 12<br><br>pre-epic:<br>stats:<br>+3 con, +2 charisma<br>bard 5<br>rdd 7<br>defender 6<br>rdd 8<br>bard 6<br><br>final pre-epic: bard 6/rdd 8/defender 6<br><br>pre-epic feats (in order): extra music, curse song, extend spell, dodge, toughness, knockdown, improved knockdown.<br><br>Or<br><br>curse song, power attack, cleave, dodge, toughness, improved critical weapon, great cleave. For the dev critters.<br><br>epic: bard 16/rdd 10/defender 14.<br><br>Hit rdd 10 first, then whatever you want, the only thing to recall is to take the bard 16th lvl last for maxed out bard skills and might as well use the bonus defender feat at 14th for epic dmg reduction 3.<br><br>7 general feats:<br>Damage reduction x2, great str 1, 4 left over feats. Most likely great strength, epic prowess, armor skin and the like.<br><br>defender 14th feat: epic damage reduction 3<br><br>+5 str during epic, +1 great str at least.<br><br>skills: spellcraft 46 (max +3 int), use magic 25 (22 + 3 cha), perform 30 (27 + 3 cha), heal or discipline maxed, tumble 40 ranks, taunt maxed.<br><br>Final stats:<br>str 28<br>dex 14<br>con 21<br>wis 8<br>int 16<br>cha 16<br><br>What this all means:<br><br>18/- dmg reduction. Virtually 21/- dmg reduction when you run curse song on the enemies due to curse song giving -3 dmg. Defenders would need 18+ lvls in defender and epic dmg reduction feats to keep up, meaning they generally hit like limp wristed girls going for 21 con.<br><br>50 spellcraft after bard song bonus means +10 spell saves on top of the bard song bonuses. Makes you save as well as any CoT would vs spells, and bard song bonus helps everyone. The occassional odd counterspelling game can also be done.<br><br>Base saves pre-epic are:<br>bard 6, fort 2, reflex 5, will 5<br>rdd 8: fort 6, ref 2, will 6<br>def: fort 5, ref 2, will 5<br><br>base saves:<br>fort 13<br>reflex 9<br>will 16<br><br>13/9/16, is comparable to any monk. And being immune to fire spells later means the most damaging reflex spells dont hurt. Remember, you have virtually +9 to spell saves even without bard song up.<br><br>bard song adds +2 hit, +3 dmg, +2 overall saves, +3 will, +5 dodge AC, +20 temp hp. All non-dispellable. Not only do warriors love you in a group, clerics do as well since dispels can be pretty common later.<br><br>37 dmg per hit from 17 (greataxe +5 or sword +5, self cast greater magic weapon) + 15 str (2 handed and minimum bull's) + 3 bard song +2 warcry. More strength of course means more damage, i.e. items, great strength feats, etc.<br><br>40 tumble even in plate armor and tower shield means you can tumble away just like a spring attacker. And get 8 AC.<br><br>14 AC boni most won't have, 8 from 40 tumble, 5 dodge from bard song, +1 from mage armor dodge.<br><br>Use magic 25 means any class restricted item is yours to use without any worries.<br><br>Heal maxed means, 1 roll + 42 skill + 10 heal kit +4 bard song = 57 hp healed.<br><br>You have a damage shield spell, wounding whispers. Most enemies can't resist sonic damage unless specially modded.<br><br>Self cast ethereal visage, gust of wind, and currently, lesser dispels (gained as a lvl 1 spell) can be used to dispel or resist most harmful area effects like web, grease, etc that would stop most other meleers cold. 45% spell failure using a 2 hander isn't that much in the heat of battle.<br><br>Self cast buffs, most importantly improved invis and warcry. And the often underestimated protection from alignment which gives mind immunity to good or evil, meaning dragon fear and such shouldn't be as much of an issue.<br><br>RDD benefits, immunity to fire, sleep, paralysis. Cool wings.<br><br>Attack bonus is comparable to most pure meleer builds, if not more. 20 AB vs 16 AB with +4 rdd str, and +2 bard song and +2 warcry and +5 dodge AC from curse song and +6 AC from taunt means. 20 ab vs 35 AC, depending on the critter.<br><br>Only glaring weakness is limited ranged capabilities, though somewhat ok with bow and arrow and standard buffs up.<br><br>You won't ever beat that WM or ranger/rdd/bard critting things like mad, but you come in a close second and those guys die from hits geared to defenders, while you merrily hack and sing you way through. And in the end, what's .66 seconds more to kill a mob for a defender as strong as the best str based ftrs?<br><br>Your saves aren't nearly as high as a CoT/pal charisma focus, but you come in at a close second.<br><br>All in all, while the other epic builds tend to have weaknesses I feel. This build covers pretty much every meleer woe quite well, and has a few spare feats to use on energy resistance in some tough elemental damaging modules, or whatever else. Not to mention, you basically skip any need for fire resistance.<br><br>The best offense isn't the best defense, but for a dwarven skald, you can get both.<br>_________________<br>I may not be able to get an erection, but at least I have enough balls not to hack.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 04/30/05 16:50</span></i></p>
