Greetings! It has been a while since i last posted here or played NWN. Recently i misclicked on a bookmark and ended up here and got interested again. This time i was thinking on a Ranger, Monk, Assassin build to create some synergy between those classes. I tried searching for something similar but in vain.<br><br>    My idea was to take a monk with his extra speed and higher rate of attacks per round and his need to wear light armor and melt it with ranger to get free dualwield weapon focuses and 16 bab. At the same time i get Favoured Enemy and Knockdowns so i am able to hack through favoured enemies quite fast. Now, since i have so many attacks per round and attack boost from ranger, then i could combine some assassin for endurance and damage.<br><br>This brings me to the question. Is Assassin worth it? A small damage boost is always good, but i could get more favoured enemies and monk special abilities if i leave assassin. I was thinking about 21 ranger, 10 monk and 9 assassin. At the same time i could take 25 Ranger, for more FE boost and 10 monk and 5 assassin, which would give me the same ammount of useful feats and some damage boost for the lower levels. Or something like 25 Ra/15 M or 30 RA /10 M<br><br>Your opinions are welcome : &gt;

It depends on your overall build design.<br><br>If you're going to be a dex build, taking assassin will be helpful to you by way of adding sneak attacks to your build.  However, you won't be able to qualify for epic dodge, and that epic dodge is the best thing dex characters have going for them.<br><br>The short version, though, is that sure you'll be able to play the character but he probably won't be as powerful as other builds might be.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Actually, 21/10/9 seems a good level/split to me. But Ranger25/6/9 sounds good too. The problem is that you must eother save Assn9(ImpInvis) or Monk6(IKD) until at very late in the build for skilldumping. Ranger12/Monk4/Assn4 pre-Epic sounds nice. Also Ranger9/Assn8/Monk3. That makes your DA useable pre-epic at least.<br><br>It can become quite tough to make the level progression right, but I'm looking forward to you doing it personally. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

With just 21 levels, will Bane of Enemies make any major difference? I would end up with just 5 or 6 FE and the damage wouldn't be that huge. Perhaps take just 9 ranger for ITWF and for the maximum AB i could get preepic. Mayby 9 Ra/13Ass/18mnk?

I have been thinking about it and i think i'll choose 9 ranger / 16 monk / 15 assassin or something similar. I think i'll start as a ranger for weapon finess which gives me a solid base in the beginning. Now i have to figure out the way how to get the maximum ammount of ac and ab out of this to be effective.
