Barbarian Battle Singer<br>Barb17/Bard23<br><br>This char is mainly geared toward doing party battles, either against another PC party or monsters.

Curse song, Taunt and Rage will detract from your opponent. Terrifying rage's DC is calculated by Intimidate + 1d10. So, they have to make a Will save against DC of 59to68, or get -2 to AB and Saves. Make opposed check against 59 taunt, or suffer max AC penalty of 6.<br><br>Although his Bard song is at lvl 22, his Curse song will be at lvl 23 thanks to boost to Perform from Bard song. So -5 to AC, -2 to AB, -3 to Dmg, -3 Fort, -2 Will, -2 Refl, -34 HP and -11 to skills! Remember, rage and songs effect multiple opponents/allies.

I would suggest trying to fit 4 Fighter levels in - gives you three more feats, Armor Prof Heavy, allows you to take WS and EWS. perhaps dropping bard to 20 and barb to 16. that way you can still take Lasting Inspiration.

I love the cheese at the end, and the halberd<br><br>thats cool<br><br>but like the above suggestion, I think you should include a few fighter levels, like at level 1 3 4 and 5<br><br>then the rest barb, I might try this out myself<br><br>halberd is my favorite weapon

Thanks for the comments. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>As for fighter... I have mixed feeling. It will net me more feats, and WS (I'm not too sure on EWS as I've never played any char with fighter lvl in epic). But at cost to skill points (granted it's only 12pts), exp penalty etc. I'll try it out on char builder and see if the benefit warrants it for me. But if you can live with exp penalty, that being worst draw back, it could be great.<br><br>Alternately, CoT might help the build... but meh. I'm no fan of that PrC.<br><br>Chiibo

You could something as simple as Barbarian 16/Bard 23/Ranger 1 if you want to keep the Epic Bard theme. The Ranger level adds a feat (Epic Prowess) plus Dual-Wield, a Favored Enemy, Trackless Step and the Set Trap, Spot and Search skills, too (and probably something else I can't remember now <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  ).
