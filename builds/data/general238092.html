I was wondering what kind of enemies do epic builders expect to see on a generic module. I'd like to get input in the form of: racial type of enemy, as much info on the build as you can give (from as vague as "melee type" to deep detail like "Level 13 Aberration with 24 STR, 16 DEX, 16 CON, 3 WIS/INT/CHA" etc.), relative toughness (CR, mob/boss type creature, that kind of stuff). The stuff you need to know when you're building a character so you know what choices you have to make to be able to face these opponents -- and survive.<br><br>I'm really just trying to find out what kind of challenges do you *know* you're going to face and thus prepare for when you're building (e.g. lesser undead are quite common at around 6th level I'd say, so you try to get your DEX Rogue builds WS at level 6 or so). I'd like to collect a list of foes for specific level ranges, and their special properties (what make them tough or easy).<br><br>I hope you understand what I'm after.<br><br>Discuss, people!<br>_________________<br>"And one calculates <i>time</i> from the <i>dies nefastus</i> on which this fatality arose – from the <i>first</i> day of Christianity! – <i>Why not rather from its last?</i> – <i>From today?</i> – Revaluation of all values!"<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 04/22/06 17:06</span></i></p>

I'm not sure if I understood everything correctly though...<br><br>I don't like to go very detailed, the race and specific stats won't have 100% importance, any character can be made strong, I expect enemies to be able to handle everything, but without the power an epic build could have, a horde of epic weapon masters, yay! then you're dead.<br><br>Normally there are lots of melees, with a few casters and regular ranged.... I guess.<br><br>A type of enemy I've always hated are powerful undead casters, like the demi-liches, but suppose they're programmed with good spells, I hate them, they've got all sorts of undead immunities, like sneaks, paralisis, sometimes even knockdowns, Spell Resistances, etc. then they can cast very strong Mestil's, stuff with protections and hard damaging spells.<br><br>I'm not really sure what is most common where, but why not do it the least common? bring enormous Pit Fiends and Dragons at level 5, just make then weaker, and fight uberly strong Zombies and Fairies at level 30, LOL.<br><br>Enemies go according to the surroundings.

I'd tend to see what the racial characteristics are of a monster and then build a creature around that based on a decent player build and give them 60% to 80% of maxed HP <br><br>-DaMouse
