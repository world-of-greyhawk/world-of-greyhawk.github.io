Hmmm, AC of Druid/Monk shifters is very high on any low magical environment, so first of all, how's the magical setting? an Arcane Archer could kill him if you can raise your AB to match his AC, which should be possible in mid to high environments.<br><br>Heh, well, think about what he has, Rakshasha builds can be annoying, but normally you can kill them if your HP is high, Clerics are very recommended as they can fight with some spells (Implosion or Harm can make wonders), dispel, fight in melee and Heal between spells...<br><br>You <b>can</b> kill him with spells, there are some good level 9 damage spells, are Rakshasas immune to Death spells? I'm not really sure, but Wail of Banshee would kill him if not, with probably Mords prior to de-buff him Sorcerers and Wizards can use Time Stop, Mords, Wail of Banshee, Bigby's and probably Meteor Swarm to kill him, on the other side, a Druid can use Storm of Vengeance and Earthquake, was Rakshasa immune to stun? I think not, if it isn't Storm of Vengeance could make an easy kill.

It's a PvP server (anti-world) w/ gear up to +5 w/ 1d6 elemental damage on most weapons, standard potions available, and some limited scrolls (no mord's scrolls, but there is spell breach scrolls).<br><br>Raks are un-nerfed I think (ie. they still have truesight and all their normal stuff).<br><br>I was thinking STR monk because their attacks/round are high (increases the chance of a 20) and at least hit for a decent amount of damage and their SR can make them magic immune.

Str buff for 1 - 2 more AB.<br><br>Flame Weapon, Haste, Mage Armor, Bull Strength, protection from elements, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, etc...  These are all good spells to put on your Shadow.<br><br>Your tactic will be to summon the shadow, buff him and hips off to the side.  Keep your shadow evade on also.  Negative Energy Ray cast at the Shadow will heal it, so will Negative Energy burst.  You could Kit it back to health too.<br><br>Not sure if the AB on the Shadow will be enough, but it's worth a shot.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 01/18/07 18:39</span></i></p>

Can't really hips to the side since Raks have true sight, and I have noticed that even on servers that nerf true sight to not automatically spot hiding opponents, it doesn't change the true sight on shifted forms for some reason and they can see all hiding opponents.

On Antiworld, you should still HIPS off to the side since it's a team based combat.  You do not want to be smacked in the head by anyone passing by.
