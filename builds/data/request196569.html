im thinking of something along the lines of 16 bard/14 BG/10 RDD.  you think a character like that could get good?  so many buffs from song/spells/divine might/divine shield/RDD buffs, that this char has to turn out to be very powerful.  i would have taken paladin instead of BG, but changing allignment can be a pain.<br><br>lvl up bard while getting power attack and cleave, then become RDD.  lvl up RDD until you can get BG.  lvl up BG until divine might/divine shield/weapon focus longsword.  Then lvl up bard a bit more, then get lvl 10 RDD.  then just lvl up bard and BG.<br><br>maybe the following stats?  and always give bonus stats to cha.<br><br>str 14<br>dex 12<br>con 14<br>int 12<br>wis 10<br>cha 15<br><br>what type of feets do you think i should get?<br><br>would still spell be important?  cause i plan on using armor, so i may need it to cast spells.<br><br>thanks for the help<br><br>-Greg

Cuz bards only max at 15 ab for lv 20 and you are talkin about taking rdd before 20, we get this sorta thing 5bard/7rdd (all in succession.  The remaining lvls should be blackguard to get the ab to 4 atts/rd (i think you need 7 lvls of blackguard or so..i remember being really frustrated tryin to tweak that with the monk/bg build, and i believe it was 7 bg pre 20).  That leaves 3 post epic bg lvls and the rest of rdd and bard.  This build would be very tough! (to answer your question)<br><br>Feats?  Str will be 22...  power attck, cleave, wf(I would take, personally dwarfaxe) improve crit, extra song, divine might, wpn prof (exotic, asap lv3 or 6) and a feat of your choice... heres somethin to think about: your str will be 22 (i would take Great str 1 and take great cleave preepic to get overwhelm crit, but thats me).  <br>post epic: ewf, epic prowess, divine shield, great charisma, overwhelmin crit.. or what ever you want.<br><br>Here's the thing i see though: the build is TRYIN to be a str build (rdd lvls), but you are wanting to twist it to a charisma build.  If you are serious about the charisma idea, id change the stats to start : str 10! why? rdd will make it 18!  this gives you a bunch of stats to add to... charimsa!  What this does is postpone some of the feats til after 12 which means you wont have as strong a melee build, but you will get ALOT more charisma.   AND!!  i would seriously consider the paladin!  I know the  alignment shift is a pain, but the pally is special, but since you made your stand (which i respect) i will move on.  the lvlin should be the same 5bard/7rdd/7bg/1bard and you should still get 4 attacks your str will be 14 before epic though.  a minor tradeoff imho.<br><br>Hope this helps<br><br>peace<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 05/26/05 05:31</span></i></p>

i tried this build out in a lvler module, and i got the following ab<br><br>38/33/28/25<br><br>i think thats pretty good, and with the bard song, it increases all the attacks by two.  not to mention the buffs from bard spells.
