Blissful Silence Assassin 30 / Rogue 10<br><br>Repercussion n.: 1: (often followed by of) an indirect effect or reaction following an event or action. 2: the recoil after impact. 3: an echo or reverberation.<br><br>Silence is blissful, is it not? The ever so serene and beautiful sound of nothingness is interrupted by not even a sudden gasp of terror, not a murmur or a harsh rasp of breath on the back of the neck of the night.<br><br>I live deep within the shadows; I stalk your every move. You don't know I am here and you think you are the only one. You spit your vengeance and rage unto the world in which you despise and you throw yourself into the vile deception of this broken world in which you hide behind. I creep along ever so silently behind you, watching you, stalking you waiting for just the perfect moment to make my first move.<br><br>I have a very short fuse that has been lit by you; I am something that wishes not to be played with nor hunted, a dangerous little thing with a very bad attitude. I hunt you down and find you and I invade your every last thought your fears and all your weaknesses.<br><br>I watch you from a far; alone I sit within the shadows and watch patiently I do. I smile to myself as I watch, I know what's coming your way, and I know what it is that's coming to get you someday.<br><br>As the day turns to night I prepare to come and visit you as you sleep, I get inside your thoughts and I tell your brain what to show you. I tell it to show you haunting images of the dead in which you have tortured and shredded. I show you the nightmares of a time and place not yet seen by you nightmares of a figure known as me coming to get you. I move in closer to you, I sit beside you as you sleep.<br><br>As I look around and plot my plans for you I can hear the beating of your heart, I can smell the fear all over you, my finger nails grow, my eyes turn to a fire red and my teeth become fangs. I send you images of wanting to tear the flesh right from your bones, just rip it off and burn it to dust. I send to you an image of myself so you can see exactly what's coming, so you can get a small clue of who and what has been stalking you<br><br>You awaken in a deep cold and terrifying sweat with the feeling of something else being with you. The hair arises to its end on the back of your neck as you look around and you see nothing<br>you see what I want you to see.<br><br>sssshhhhh.............<br><br>There’s something out there. Out in the same forest in which you travel alone, try to find me, try to seek me out and hunt me down. I control your every thought, your every feeling and the nightmares of me in which you have in your precious sleep is only the beginning of that in which I plan on doing to you.<br><br>I am gonna take all your sleepless nights and very much turn to them into the darkest of all days. The visions of an impending doom follow you through your journeys, they taunt you, they laugh at you, and you look down and see you have a present from me all over your arms. Scratches that tell you of a future to come for you, the present from me to you. A mere shadow as to who it is that you attacked for no reason. Mere images turn to reality of who is coming back for you.<br><br>Hear me whisper to you in your ears, turn around and find that there is no one there, feel my breath upon the back of your neck. Shiver and try to run away from the fear of doom, hide like always, and hide in the darkness in which you call your reality. I will find you. I will hurt you for every little thing you've done to others through anger and rage, I will give back to you, your evil little ways shall crumble to the dirt in which you shiat and your vile little world of deception and torture shall perish unto the dark abyss in which it is that you crawled out from.<br><br>I can see you.<br><br>I am behind you.<br><br>Moving in closer and closer towards you and ready to make my move. I let you feel my breath and I let you turn to see me. You beg and plead for mercy and beg of me not to show you my sadistic ways. You scream for help from all your new breed friends to come and help you scream but no one hears. Now it's my turn to show you just how far my boundaries really do go and just how close to the limits of the damned you are to facing your reality, your new reality which is me!<br><br>Race:

Your pre-epic distribution looks rather awful.  5/5/10 doesn't give much either saving throw-wise or BAB wise.  Even going 4/6/10 nets +1 BAB and +1 to all saves. Another alternative is 4/8/8 which gives +1 to reflex and +2 BAB.
