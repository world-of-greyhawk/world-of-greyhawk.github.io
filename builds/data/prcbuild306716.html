<b>Author's Foreword</b><br>I have been attempting to design a character that had four, in my opinion, essential feats: Terrifying Rage, Devastiating Critical, Dragon Shape, and Mighty Rage. Actually, Mighty Rage was just a bonus when I discovered that with right adjustment with starting statistics, I would be able to take this feat.<br><br>There are actually two versions of this build, I only posted the one with four mentioned feats. The other version had higher intelligence which gives you more skillpoints and skills to have but had no mighty rage.<br><br>Anyway, as before, I tried to design a character that had terrifying rage, devastating critical and dragon shape in vanilla NWN. But since the latest patch made that impossible, I looked at PRC as option. I looked through various races and wanted the closest humanoid race with good starting statistics. I came across Bralani Eladrin and Zakya Rakshasa. Both are equally good, the second choice may be better since it had two primary attributes that will start pretty high, strength and constitution. But I settled on Bralani Eladrin since I liked the idea that you were immune to Petrification.... Anyway, without any further ado.... here's the build.<br><br>Oh, I did not include the class feats or racial feats in this build.<br><br><b>Advantages</b><br>-Terrifying Rage<br>-Dragon Shape<br>-Mighty Rage<br>-Devastating Critical<br>-Possesses level 9 spells (I believe it was four slots for ninth level).<br>-High Hitpoints(lasts longer, better durability) - at the highest as raging dragon, it can reach 1088 unbuffed and with no constitution item boosters.<br>-Immunity to Electricity and Petrification<br>-Spell Resistance of 57 at 40th level (62 if Zakya Rakshasa) - On par with pure monk!<br>-Spell Power +10<br>-Damage Reduction 3(assuming you took last level as barbarian)<br><br><b>Disadvantages</b><br>-May find difficulty with rogues at early levels.<br>-Does not have many skillsets to work with (unless going Intelligence route).<br>-No Epic Prowess (unless you drop Mighty Rage or Devastating Critical)<br>-No Dragon Shape until level 36<br><br><b>Leveling Guide</b><br>Name: Fierce Divinest<br>Race: Bralani Eladrin (Or Zakya Rakshasa)<br><br>Starting Attributes:<br>() = Racial Modifier<br>STR: 16(24)<br>DEX: 8 (16)<br>CON: 16(22)<br>INT: 8 (10)<br>WIS: 16(20)<br>CHA: 8 (12)<br><br>Attribute Bonuses<br>Level 4: Strength<br>Level 8: Wisdom<br>Level 12: Wisdom<br>Level 16: Wisdom<br>Level 20: Wisdom<br>Level 24: Wisdom<br>Level 28: Wisdom<br>Level 32: Wisdom<br>Level 36: Wisdom<br>Level 40: Strength<br><br><b>Leveling Guide/Feat Distribution</b><br>1. <b>Barbarian 1:</b> Weapon Focus(Greataxe)<br>2. <b>Barbarian 2</b> <br>3. <b>Druid 1:</b> Blind-Fight<br>4. <b>Druid 2</b><br>5. <b>Druid 3</b><br>6. <b>Barbarian 3:</b> Power Attack<br>7. <b>Druid 4</b><br>8. <b>Barbarian 4</b><br>9. <b>Druid 5:</b> Cleave<br>10. <b>Barbarian 5</b><br>11. <b>Druid 6</b><br>12. <b>Barbarian 6:</b> Improved Critical(Greataxe) - Stop putting points into Lore after this level<br>13. <b>Druid 7</b><br>14. <b>Barbarian 7</b><br>15. <b>Druid 8: </b> Any Metamagic feat (I went with Extend)<br>16. <b>Barbarian 8</b><br>17. <b>Druid 9</b><br>18. <b>Barbarian 9:</b> Great Cleave<br>19. <b>Druid 10</b><br>20. <b>Barbarian 10</b><br>21. <b>Druid 11:</b> Overwhelming Critical(Greataxe)^<br>22. <b>Barbarian 11</b><br>23. <b>Druid 12</b><br>24. <b>Barbarian 12:</b> Devastating Critical(Greataxe)^<br>25. <b>Druid 13</b><br>26. <b>Hierophant 1:</b> Spell Power +2<br>27. <b>Hierophant 2:</b> Great Wisdom I, Spell Power +4<br>28. <b>Barbarian 13</b><br>29. <b>Druid 14</b><br>30. <b>Hierophant 3:</b> Great Wisdom II, Spell Power +6<br>31. <b>Barbarian 14</b><br>32. <b>Druid 15</b><br>33. <b>Barbarian 15:</b> Terrifying Rage<br>34. <b>Druid 16</b><br>35. <b>Druid 17</b> @<br>36. <b>Druid 18:</b> Dragon Shape<br>37. <b>Hierophant 4:</b> Spell Power +8<br>38. <b>Hierophant 5:</b> Spell Power +10<br>39. <b>Barbarian 16:</b> Mighty Rage^^<br>40. <b>Druid 19/Barbarian 17</b><br><br>Ending Attributes:<br>STR: 26<br>DEX: 16<br>CON: 22<br>INT: 10<br>WIS: 30<br>CHA: 12<br><br>Final Skillset:<br>Spellcraft: 40<br>Listen: 21<br>Intimidate: 43<br>Discipline: 43<br><br>The statistics assumes you have taken barbarian at level 40.

Sorry, I wasn't clear about what I intended.<br><br>What I meant was that I wanted to make a character that can do devastating critical while not shifted. Also have capability of shifting into dragon when the need for it arises and have spell power to the boot.<br><br>So, basically I am covering many aspects that can be utilized in any methods you desire.<br><br>Hope that clears what I meant.<br><br>Anuis<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 02/21/09 20:55 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>There isn't any reason to try it in vanilla NWN, Dev Crit doesn't work on dragon shape there.

Anuis and i talked about doing the Dragon with Dev crit thing, which in PRC is fairly easy to do (i documented that in another link in this forum).

Hmmmm, well, I didn't observe thoroughly enough to see the "Devastating Critical(Greataxe)" there, I just figured it would be unarmed for the dragon since that would render a higher AB.

However, the greataxe can be exchanged for some other weapon that you prefer.<br><br>As for what Avado mentioned, I did consider those alternative, but the requirements was too great and I was restricted to either 16 or 17 levels of barbarian and 18 levels of druid. The rest was extra, I had one class in mind but it did not stack with natural armor apparently, so I threw that one out. So I was left with two other classes that appealed to me, hierophant and contemplative.<br><br>Contemplative however was better suited if you wanted more slots per level... I believe with this one in the mix, you would end with 5 or 6 slots for level 9 spell.. I don't remember and don't have the notes with me at the moment.
