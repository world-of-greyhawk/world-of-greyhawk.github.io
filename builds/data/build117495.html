It might be better to go with rogue instead of assasin if you are just looking for the sneak attack. Death Attack is 10 + lvl + int bonus. So your DA is only 23 without intelligence buffs. I would recommend cutting the ranger lvls down to ten which would give you a DA of 33. You could add items/spells to give you 39. That is a little on the weak side but close to giving you more death attacks.<br><br>But if you want just the sneak attack it would be better to start as a rogue with less int. You will end up with more skills and not have to increase int. (Or even strt with lower int.)<br>_________________<br>Entropy is a joule thief

i dont  see the point for goin 10wm, if you go only 7 wm and 23 ranger you get bane , what gives you +2d6 dmg and +2 ab , also the exra dmg from bane will be multiplied on a critical hit.

You do realize your responding to a build that was posted 1.7 years ago, which was moved here by bilb0 from another forum, that was probably initially created when HotU first came out, right?<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
