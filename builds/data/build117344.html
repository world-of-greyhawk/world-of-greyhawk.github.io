Well, for one, this one gets one more epic feat courtesy of Dwarven Defender bonus feats. Second, he can spend two less feats on great strength because of his con bonus. Third, he has more than twice the amount of damage reduction as the barbarian counterpart. The barbarian version had 9/-; this one has a whopping 24/-. Fourth, he can cast defensive stance so many times that it nearly nullifies the fact he can't move while he stances. Fifth, this build has d4 more hp than the barbarian version. Sure, that's not THAT much, but still! And finally, sixth, this one can actually knockdown foes without the help of items.<br>:shrugs:<br><br>~ Lock.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/26/08 07:42</span></i></p>

Not sure if this is possible, but I've made my own Dwarven Defender Build, and I manage 6 Fighter/7WM/27 DWD.<br><br>Is there any way that switching feats around slightly(Like Power Attack/Cleave) to get the prereq. for WM faster would allow you to do that? I think that if it's possible, without losing any feats, the build will definitely come out better.

Anuis, you're breaking the rules man!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   Remeber to post the class and level breakdown of the build in the title of your post.

Nah, no rules were broken.  Lock posted this way back in March before the rules about posting classes was made.  I also believe that he originally posted it in one of the Looking For Excellent Character Builds threads, and it was moved over to the guild site. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"><br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

I haven't gotten around to editing the topics so they contain the level break down with each classes.

Sorry, all...I realize it's old, just wondering if it -was- possible to take the WM sooner and get the same outcome...or close to the same, minus some of the fighter feats you'd lose.
