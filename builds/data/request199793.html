There is no way to get 4/round with those character classes, since they all have 3/4 BAB progression.

The main problem you're going to have increasing your attacks is that all three classes are 3/4 ab progression.<br>By taking the Bard1 at lvl5 you're actually damaging your build's base attack as well.  Unless you're stuck on the rogue part; I would have a rethink - bard has almost the same skillset as rogue; for the loss of sneak (which only really benefits a party animal or a ShadowDancer to be honest).<br><br>If you really want devcrit with 4 attacks/round and a decent attack bonus; you might consider the following:<br>Try Bard20/RDD10/COT10<br>Bard5/RDD8/COT7 br epic gives:<br>Bard4 = 3<br>Bard5 = 0<br>RDD8 = 6<br>COT7 = 7<br>Base Attack = 16; 4 attacks/round.<br><br>What would this give you?<br>1) Higher CHA.  What does this do:<br>a) with good Perform and Bard20: You can get all the fun song feats along with your devcrit prereq's.  what is this to you? A healthy boost to your stats, including ac, skill points, and ab.<br>b) UMD Bonus; and Perform Bonus<br>c) COT Divine Wrath [iirc the name]: Increase your fighting stats for a few rounds.  Useful in a pinch.<br>d) COT healing AND Smite.  Useful for doling out damage to that demilich.<br>e) Improved Saves from COT<br>f) More, but I can't think of it right now<br><br>2) First 10 COT levels = fighter feat progression.  Lots more feats to get those prereq's; and some dualwield if you so choose.  FREE martial and iirc heavy armor [cant confirm, my Grimoir at home atm].<br><br>3) If you take 4 or more COT before epic, you will have 4 attacks per round. Don't take all 10; the RDD is better to progress fully first, due to the bonus's; and you might want some epic 'character' feats off the COT.<br><br>I'm sure there are better classes for you to use; but the last benefit actually seals it for me.  No XP penalty whatsoever for any race.  Pretty much sums up the best part of the bonus right there.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 06/16/05 08:17</span></i></p>

If you can wait post-epic for the last 2 RDD levels and get 2 more ranger or bard levels you'd have 18 BAB. Your epic levels don't affect the number of attacks you get and regardless of class add +1 BAB per 2 levels.<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.
