Yet another dex build. This particular class combo has only been done once before, and that spin on it wasn't quite the same. So, master of a fighting style so mystical and amazing that to even speak its name would ... ah, whatever.<br><br>The build's main strength is high AB while dual wielding with kamas (still respectable if you add a flurry on top of that). Respectable AC and Epic Dodge, along with good HP, help you survive to dish out those attacks.<br><br>However, as with most builds of this sort, our friend here doesn't know the meaning of the word damage.

You say it's "preferable" in a high magic environment... I say it's worthless unless you have some powerfully enhanced weapons. You can't deal any damage! However, I can see it being very powerful when you start getting some +10 Kamas and magical damage bonuses etc. It's nice, but I wouldn't recommend it in low/mid magic environment.<br>_________________<br>"...<br>C'est un pays plus nu que la terre polaire<br>— Ni bêtes, ni ruisseaux, ni verdure, ni bois!<br><br>Or il n'est pas d'horreur au monde qui surpasse<br>La froide cruauté de ce soleil de glace<br>Et cette immense nuit semblable au vieux Chaos;<br>..."<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 06/13/06 21:47</span></i></p>

And don't try to level it up. It will be killed, killed and killed as it's three main things at least until Weapon finesse. Why Weapon master? For AB? Why not assassin?

Grarrr...yes, I know the weaknesses. This was more experimental than anything else - I wanted to get a high AB along with other things. I never can seem to remember the importance of damage until it starts to cause me to be murdered.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

Don't know why you guys are being so harsh on the lad.  Obviously in a low magic world he is not going to be able to hurt anyone, he stated that himself.  For what it was built for, a high magic world with +10 and better weps with elemental damage available, it will do quite nicely.  Not all builds need to be strength oriented, or made for low magic worlds.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>An epic dodge guy with nice hp's, decent ac and good ab, and had to fit in the weapon master prereqs, nicely done.  Yes, he had better travel in a party early on in his career, but you need to say that about quite a few chars on here. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DarkStar27909 on 06/14/06 08:48</span></i></p>

The only way dual wield monk vs. an unarmed monk is worthwhile is if there is sneak damage or devcrit somewhere in the equation. <br>Max damage on a good unarmed attack with no str bonus or enhancements can be 40 on a crit. With kamas you can hit 18 as a weapon master. Meh.

So that's yet another reason to play this guy on a high-magic server...but we already knew that.

Yeah, you'd need 16 monk levels to get the d20 fists, and you'd have to be a medium sized race.<br><br>This build is interesting, but for reasons already elaborated, impractical in many environments.  If you can get really, really good magical kamas it is a great deal more attractive, but will still lag offensively behind most other builds in the same high magic environment.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
