Magistrate Winfried was pleased. He was now the ruler of the underground of Canvis. He had spent large amounts of gold on bribes, and even used a fair share of torture. It was well worth it. His work to find the thieves guild had finally paid off. After last weeks successful attack on their main hideout, his profits was already up. Outwards he was a magistrate, who was well respected among the city proper. Some of that respect had been paid for of course, but that’s just the way things work.<br>In reality, his forces had crushed the main body of the thieves guild and their leaders had been replaced with his men. Controlling the criminal operations was the key to large amounts of money, and also gave him the opportunity to spy and even conveniently get rid of political opponents.<br>One thing bothered him a bit though, but not to much. The old leader of the Guild known only as The Mongrel had not yet been apprehended, but it was a matter of time. The captain of the guard was close on his tail the last he heard.<br><br>Winfried was aware that he still had quite a few enemies out there and surrounded himself with at least a dozen of his best and most trusted warriors. It was annoying, but well worth it. He was already dreaming of the day he would control the City State completely. He just needed to play slow and easy, but it was within his grasp now. He sat there smiling to himself. It was a magnificent evening. A rap on the door brought him abruptly back to reality. <i>“Sir?”</i> his attendant was standing in the doorway. <i>“I have a Halfling runner here with a packet for you.”</i> Winfried suddenly got excited. It had to be from his men. Perhaps The Mongrel was “taken care of”. <i>”send him in. Take his weapons first.”</i><br><br>As said as done. A Halfling dressed in dark entered the room. He smiled and approached Winfried. Two guards immediately blocked his path, and the others gathered around the Magistrate.<br><i>”No need to be so jumpy”</i> the short one stated, his eerie voice sending shivers down the guards spines. He gave the packet to one of the guards. He passed it on to his boss. Winfried grabbed the packet with shining eyes. He ripped it open and looked down. His face lost all colour as he pulled his “gift” out. It was the head of the captain of the guard. A note was attached to it. <br><b>Congratulations on your successful attack on my thieves guild. Hope you have enjoyed your LAST week. *signed* The Mongrel</b><br><br>He looked up, terrified. He saw the Halfling standing there, grinning. He balanced one dagger, point down, in each of his hands. The next thing that happened was only a blur of motion. The left hand dagger flew from the Halflings hand and struck a guard in the throat. Then he was among the guards who were shielding the magistrate, dancing, spinning and stabbing with his lone dagger. He moved so fast they couldn’t land a blow, he always seemed to evade or be somewhere else when the blow fell. Suddenly all was silent, The Halfling standing among the guards. All with a deadly wound in artery, throat, back or heart. Winfried couldn’t help it, he looked straight into his eyes. It was the coldest, most frightening eyes he had ever seen. <i>”You dealt us a major setback, I’ll give you that, but die assured, heads will roll. My master will get us back up. Now, make peace with your god.”</i> Winfried wet his pants, and started to weep. With one swift move, the assassin plunged his dagger straight into the heart of his victim. Winfried fell down, his life ebbing fast. Visions of his grand future fading from his inner eye and all went black. Forever.<br>_________<br><br><b>Deadly and efficient, sneaking steadily to hit 40.

They were: assassin, nice death attack DC, lots of sneak dice, improved Whirlwind attack , epic dodge and SC V.<br>He also wanted Blinding speed. I dropped that from the build, took EWF instead.

You have 1 stat point left over, which I put in STR, since it is the only to benefit from it. For carrying. The strength of this build is obvious. Stealth and go into a group of enemies then unleash IWWA. You will see your huge amount of damage popping up everywhere. Then HiPS again and repeat. You have the option of just repeating IWWA without HiPS, since you got SC V and epic dodge. Even when engaged one seem to get a lot of sneak attacks connecting when you use IWWA. A nice treat. You have the assassins darkness and invis to rely on. You don’t need imp invis really, since you got SC V, an undispellable concealment always on.<br><br>When facing enemies who are sneak immune, you must rely on your UMD skill and your trapping skills. The ways in which you can inflict damage is sneak attacks, traps or UMD. Death attack DC is 38 by the way. Quite useful.<br><br>Weaknesses of this build is the lack of KD. Armor skin and epic prowess would be nice to. So this build has to few feats.

The Grimoire says you need 30 Tumble to get Epic Dodge, which means 27th lvl minimum. I saw you took epic dodge at 24th lvl instead...I'm not 100% sure whether the grimoire is right or not, though.

Well all be buggerd!  I was able to take epic dodge AND blinding speed at lv 21 goin rogue 21 pure (i couldnt take both, but both were available * edit)!  OMG!  I have lost faith in the book!  (oh yeah, i took imp evasion and def roll startd elf with dex 20 so at 20 i had 25 dex tumble 1 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">    ).<br><br>At first i was wondering the same thing about what jenna said.  NO IC?  No epic prowess!  OMG!  HOw do you hit things for damage!  I was thinking, with all those feats.. wm would be sweet!  But then you made your point!  YOu play different than I do!  LOL  Thanks for the lesson.   Suggestion:  maybe a name could have been   Sneak and Freak!

well, thank you everyone. As for IWWA, try it, it is very good, better than one would think. If you take WWA for some reason, spend an extra feat for IWWA. When you do the spinning dance, and death attacks at DC 38 and hits for around 70-100 to all enemies you hit flat footed for 10 feet, believe me, you give your party a flying start. When you land again, and if most opponents are stunned, just repeat. All those who are stunned will receive another sneak attack. Also, all enemies in row 2 will receive sneak attack when you do IWWA.<br><br>And yes, one must wonder how you are able to hit anyone without Epic Prowess, since it gives an AMAZING +1 to your AB. 40 AB isn't to bad in a rogue build. Remember, a large portion of your attacks will be on flat footed opponents.<br><br>As for IC, it is utterly, completely useless with this guy. Remember if you are unarmed, you will still do 20d6 sneak attacks at AB 37. That is so funny.<br><br>I admit I miss KD, though. And would like Armor Skin, and last priority of these, Epic Prowess.<br><br>When you say that I can't take this and that feat or power at this or so level, please continue to do that! But I just want to say that all my builds are actually built in a leveller these days. Some of them are even played all the way in a PW, and all are taken through some tests at different levels, or used in modules at some point at least.<br><br>Yeah yeah, I know, i have posted errors, that is why I thoroughly test my characters now. And I have fun doing it.<br><br>Again, thanks for the response to this build. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

I would tried to include prowess but it's not required, it just helps.  KD is good but you have darkness from assassin and HIPS to help you get extra sneaks off.<br><br>IWWA does make a dramatic improvement over WWA, at least in theory - doubling the distance at which it can hit enemies around the user increases the area it covers dramatically - a circle with radius 5 has an area of about 78.  A circle with radius 10 has an area of about 315.  That's four times larger.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

It seems that we always build a build the way we build!  LOL  IF that makes any sense!  What i mean is, since this is a melee build, it seems hard for most of us to not have prowess or ic, but when you get into HOW you play this build, you dont need it at all!  Hence the beauty AND the often overlooked reason to share builds!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Well, a thread has popped up on the NWN General Discussion Forum about the advantages of Great Cleave and IWWA and peeps were saying it didn't work with SAs - <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=460005&amp;forum=42" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br>Anyhow, GD says it works, Grimnir I assume has tested it and it works so what's right? This build is kind of based around IWWA to rain paralyzing death on mobs but it wouldn't be worth getting it if that tactic doesn't work.<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif"><br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

I actually played this on a mod I had in my DB. Started him at lvl 17, and played to lvl 24. Then i started him at lvl 40 in a mod, and stealthed into the middle of an enemy group, weaker than me, and whammo. Even round two, without stealth, those in rank two, i.e. not close to you who doesn't attck you gets hit by sneaks. i will retest it now, though. This build was tested with older than 1.65 mods, but no way have they removed that in a patch, eh?

Didn't make it in time to edit. This build is utterly totally useless. IWWA does not even work with Darkness. It does not work with sneak attacks at all.<br><br>I am furious right now, and praise the lord I have not yet begun his career in my PW.

Here is how to make him playable. He won't be special anymore, just  an assassin with decent Death attack DC, nice AB, good AC and Epic Dodge plus SC V.<br><br>Pre epic. Switch Spring attack, Expertise and WWA for KD, IKD and Shield proficiency.<br><br>Epic, switch IWWA for Epic prowess.<br><br>If you want, start with STR 10, DEX 20 and CON 12 that will save you one Gr DEX feat, use it for armor skin.<br><br>You lose 40 hp, but gain 2 AC. Now, he is playable again. And he is still capable of reaping.<br><br>Naked AB is now 41.<br>AC will be 32 with mundane shield. <br><br>Or AC 34 mundane shield + armor skin and max hp 282.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 11/28/05 20:33</span></i></p>

It would be great if they would fix it up (like many other things) but I'm not that confident they will. Also NWN2 is not that far away, so...
