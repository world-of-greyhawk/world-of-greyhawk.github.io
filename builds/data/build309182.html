There's always another Druid build I can make.<br><br>Oh, well, I've seen a dozen concepts of Arcane Archers with Weapon Master or two weapons made out to have a decent stand in both melee and ranged, so here's another one. The deal is this build gets enough Druid levels to have a powerful range of spells, with very high WIS to net good DCs, the very same WIS that boosts AB in ranged, and shapeshift to cover up for melee, the dragon works pretty neat, too bad I can't squeeze a fourth class to get that Monk AC bonus, but in the end, I got a fine AB for both the melee and ranged attacks, so it's alright.<br><br>Playability: 1 - 40 PvM, untested PvP.<br><br>Race: Elf<br><br>Alignment: Any neutral.<br><br>Abilities:<br>STR 12<br>DEX 13<br>CON 12<br>WIS 17 (32)<br>INT 12<br>CHA 8<br><br>1 Druid1 - Point Blank Shot<br>2 Druid2<br>3 Druid3 - Rapid Shot<br>4 Druid4 - WIS +1 (18)<br>5 Druid5<br>6 Druid6 - Zen Archery<br>7 Druid7<br>8 Druid8 - WIS +1 (19)<br>9 Druid9 - Blind-Fight<br>10 Druid10<br>11 Druid11<br>12 Drdui12 - WIS +1 (20), Empower Spell*<br>13 Druid13<br>14 Druid14<br>15 Druid15 - Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>16 Druid16 - WIS +1 (21)<br>17 Druid17<br>18 Druid18 - Improved Critical: Longbow<br>19 Druid19<br>20 Druid20 - WIS +1 (22)<br>21 Wizard1 - Great Wisdom I (23)<br>22 ArcaneArcher1<br>23 ArcaneArcher2<br>24 ArcaneArcher3 - WIS +1 (24), Great Wisdom II (25)<br>25 ArcaneArcher4<br>26 ArcaneArcher5<br>27 ArcaneArcher6 - Great Wisdom III (26)<br>28 ArcaneArcher7 - WIS +1 (27)<br>29 ArcaneArcher8<br>30 ArcaneArcher9 - Great Wisdom IV (28)<br>31 ArcaneArcher10<br>32 ArcaneArcher11 - WIS +1 (29)<br>33 ArcaneArcher12 - Great Wisdom V (30)<br>34 ArcaneArcher13<br>35 ArcaneArcher14 - Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>36 Druid21 - WIS +1 (31), Dragon Shape<br>37 ArcaneArcher15<br>38 ArcaneArcher16<br>39 ArcaneArcher17 - Called Shot**<br>40 ArcaneArcher18 - Wis +1 (32), Epic Prowess<br><br>*Empower Spell can be changed for another metamagic, that one is my favorite.<br>**Called Shot can be replaced by many feats like Knockdown, Armor Skin or another Metamagic.

I must say, for a druid they are very nice.  I dont think id try them cuz that would be against my religion (though i tend to true neutral!).<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted <b>06/23/04</b> 21:16 (GMT) -- Anuis<br><br>Suolucider, Blitz 04, <b>avado</b>, Quisition, Boourns, ... welcome to the guild!

Enlighten me on why you take this split instead of 24/1/15?<br><br>As I can only see advantages to that, really.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

Care to share those advantages? I chose 20 Druid to max the spellbook, level 21 was just to take dragon shape and the rest is into Arcane Archer to reach a high Enchant Arrow. What I see from 24/1/15 is that he gets a better penetration and resistance to dispel, maxes up Owl's Insight and loses only 1 enchant arrow, so with no items buffed AB would stay the same and damage would drop only 1. Maybe it is better, that spread didn't really cross my mind.<br><br>I didn't want to change the spread mainly for the title, but the 4 APR version could take 20/1/19 for another enchant arrow, I was trying to focus on that.<br><br>Oh damn it, now that I take a look at it, seems I posted it too fast, HP should be 392 and AC should be 15 (10 base +1 DEX +4 Tumble). I ask for the asistance of a moderator to correct that.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
