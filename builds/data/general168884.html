So far I have kinda planned the first 20 lvls, but what I would like to acheive I'm not sure is realistic for a solid working build thats playable through the levels.<br>Here is my objective:<br>A distance damage expert; using spells and arrows as the primary attack of choice, but capable of using daggers for short, brief encounters when arrows and spells run out.<br><br>Could someone perhaps offer a critique of what I have got so far, perhaps help me to complete the build?  If possible, I would eventually like to accheive two epic spells (Epic Mage Armor and Epic Warding [hellball would be a nice-to-have-pre-melee-backup but not essential]) and 40 tumble out of it as well [there I go asking the impossible again <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">     ].<br><br><br>The Bladed Archer (I am not sure if there is a similar build out there, I got to thinking of the classes used from the  Rogue/Wiz/AA by Aquion Charlemagne - rog17/wiz1/aa22)<br><br>Starting details:<br>Rogue<br>Str : 10<br>Dex : 18<br>Con : 13<br>Int : 16<br>Wis : 8<br>Cha : 8<br>First level Feat : Ambidex [I figured he would dual-weild if he needs to melee since he will have a bad ac due to dex penalties in armor]<br><br><br>Skills<br>On rogue levels, max the following:<br>Open Lock<br>Tumble<br>UMD<br>On all levels, Max the following:<br>Lore<br>Heal<br>On Wiz levels, Max the following:<br>Concentrate<br>Spellcraft<br>On AA Levels, Max the following:<br>**None.** could not see any worthwhile skills for the build that were not cross-class<br><br>Level Guide from lvl2 onwards:<br>Lvl02 : Rogue2<br>Lvl03 : Rogue3; FEAT: Finness [take advantage of dex in melee]<br>Lvl04 : Rogue4; Increase INT [need 19 for lvl9 spells]<br>Lvl05 : Wizard1 [Rogue4]<br>Lvl06 : Wizard2; FEAT: Weapon Focus Longbow<br>Lvl07 : Rogue5 [Wizard2]<br>Lvl08 : Rogue6 [Wizard2]<br>Lvl09 : Rogue7 [Wizard2]; FEAT: Point Blank Shot<br>Lvl10 : AA1 [Rogue7, Wizard2]<br>Lvl11 : AA2 [Rogue7, Wizard2]<br>Lvl12 : AA3 [Rogue7, Wizard2];Increase INT; FEAT: Improved Crit Longbow<br>Lvl13 : AA4 [Rogue7, Wizard2]<br>Lvl14 : AA5 [Rogue7, Wizard2]<br>Lvl15 : AA6 [Rogue7, Wizard2]; FEAT: Rapid Shot<br>Lvl16 : AA7 [Rogue7, Wizard2]; Increase Int<br>Lvl17 : AA8 [Rogue7, Wizard2]<br>Lvl18 : AA9 [Rogue7, Wizard2]; FEAT: Spell Penetration[thinking about focus: dagger for melee?] [could not thing of anything better, useful for casting]<br>Lvl19 : AA10 [Rogue7, Wizard2]<br>Lvl20 : Wiz3 [Rogue7, AA10]<br>***AT THE NEXT LEVELUP[Char lvl21] THERE ARE 98 POINTS AVAILABLE.***<br>The basic details for the build; naked<br>AC: 16<br>Fort : 11<br>Reflex : 17<br>Will : 7<br>Base Attack : 16<br><br>Attack:<br>::UNARMED<br>+20/+15/+10/+5<br>::Using a standard non-enhanced longbow:<br>+26/+21/+16/+11<br>1-8 +5 (crit 19-20)<br>::Using dual standard non-enhanced daggers:<br>Main: +16/+11/+6/+1<br>Off : +16<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 12/08/04 01:37</span></i></p>

Hmm..  as far as i can see, how were you planning on gettin epic spells?  If my math is right, you'd have to spend the next 21 lvls on wizard... but thats just me.<br><br>If that is what you wish, the easier alternative is to do bard/pm/aa..   <br><br>leveling: in the first 20 lvls you want to get 10 arcane archer lvls to get to 4 attacks.  bard and pm should make up the other 10  with a 6/4 split (im guessing,as i havent made this char yet).  This would give you the tumble, umd  and possibility of 4 atts.. with epic spells.   <br><br>Post 20.. take bard at 21 and 40 to get tumble and umd maxd.  that leaves 8 bard/10aa/4pm with 22s accounted for.  That leaves 18 lvls left.  Of those, to get epic we need 16 pm lvls (i know 15, but why not take the extra lvl for the bonus feat <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  )  We have 4  that means 12 pm lvls  post epic.   And 6 arcane archer lvls make up the lvl 40..   barb 8/pm16/aa16.<br><br>Im not sure if you can do this (i will test as soon as i get off this post)but it looks good on paper!  Oh and you get that other handy little thing.. imm to crits.  NOt too shabby!  I think ill make one myself (although id like to have the aa lvls higher.  Oh well.)<br><br>Peace

Well, i testd it out: got epic spells at 33 (both).  BAB i got was lower than yours  (i took 4 bard/4pm/2bard/10aa to 20.. maybe why).    At end of it i had AC of 40   29/24/19/14 unarmd   47/42/37/32 with longbow.  NOt heavy on damage (crit for 37).. but is what you askd for otherwise.  I ended with dex 31 taking great dex 3..  Of course there is alot that can be done to it but i hope i was able to help you out.  <br><br>Peace

Have you considered a zen archery build? You could go cleric as your casting class. You wouldn't be able to get mage armor or warding but you could still get hellball or greater ruin. I made a zen archery build with cleric/CoT/and 2 lvls of monk just for the ac bonus and I can get an AB of 72 with just a regular longbow.<br><br>The good thing about CoT is that you have to be proficient in a melee weapon so you could make it daggers. Then you get so many bonus feats that you can make yourself proficient in bows and probably even get all the duel wield feats.

I think I might need a bit more thought on my classes.
