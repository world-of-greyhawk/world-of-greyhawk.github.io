<b>Playable 1-40 in PvE</b><br><br>******<br><br>Either nobody noticed, or could believe, the helmeted head of one of the town's guardsmen come rolling onto the village green between the stalls of produce from the surrounding farms.  When it was followed by his mangled body, however, the bustling market was shocked into silence that lasted all of two seconds before it erupted into full-blown chaos.  Farmers and villagers ran in every direction as a monstrously winged figure followed the guard's body, a huge, blood-dripping blade in its hands.<br><br>Those who were nearest to the man - if such a thing could be called a man - were chilled to their core by what they heard.  He was... singing.<br><br>This fact only had seconds to register before he took a deep breath, then exhaled a plume of fire that burned the hapless peasants before him to ash and set the town ablaze all across its center.  The fire didn't seem to touch him as he strode through it, systematically putting any wounded survivors to the sword.  The town guard had already been slaughtered in a short, ugly fight near the gates and now the town was his to do with as he pleased.<br><br>In truth, he hadn't intended to destroy this pitiful excuse for a village.  It wasn't worth his attention and effort.  But the town guard had recognized him and tried to arrest him, and he'd decided there was nothing to it but to put these primitive screwheads back in their place.  Besides, a fight, even a pathetic fight like those guards had offered, always stirred his blood.  "Must be the Dragon in me," he thought with a smirk, and so he sang a bawdy bar tune as he ran his sword through anyone unlucky enough to cross his path, spreading fire and death through the main streets of the town.  <br><br>He was snapped out of his casual rampage when an arrow whistled past him, a near-miss.  "In the name of Justice and Honor, surrender or we shall destroy you, devil!"  Four would-be heroes faced off with the dark figure from across an intersection in the the road.  He could see an archer, two swordsmen, and one who was likely a magic-user.<br><br>"It is you who should surrender, worthless whelplings, though I'll have no mercy for you either way!" He snarled, taunting the obviously inexperienced group.  Maybe this town would provide him with some worthwhile amusement afterall.<br><br>The swordsmen charged him, and closed the distance quickly but not quickly enough.  Mouthing a spell he darkened the intersection with magic, effectively blinding his opponents.  His own magically enhanced draconic senses, and his experience fighting inside just such magical darknesses, however, showed him clearly where they were.  He passed right between the swordsmen, unnoticed, and ran his blade through the victim he'd thought was the greatest threat - the wizard.<br><br>For her part, Jiallen the Splendiforous was deep in spellcasting when the sword passed easily through her enchanted robes... and through her frail body.  She'd intended to smite the evildoer with a bolt of lightning, and the spell completed with her dying breaths, thundering into the darkness, a magic that would have ended the life of many foes but that seemed to deflect around the dragon-man's supernatural defenses.  Before she finished bleeding out, she heard her archer companion Feslack's death cry, over and above the confused and panicked shouts of her other partymates.  Then silence broken only by her gasping, desperate attempt to stay conscious.<br><br>Jiallen knew she would soon be dead, and knew her friends were all dead or dying, and cursed into the darkness, "Damn you, fiend, am I to die without ever knowing by whom I met my fate?"<br><br>To her surprise the answer came from nearby her.  The killer was sitting on a box, watching her last moments, letting her die slowly, sounding amuse.  "I am Zarkhal the Dragonborn.  Maybe you've heard of me."  And he started singing, as the life left the young mage.<br><br>******<br><br>Human, Neutral Evil or Chaotic Evil<br><br>Str 15<br>Dex 10<br>Con 14<br>Int 14<br>Wis 10<br>Cha 14<br><br>1 bard (1): power attack, curse song*<br>2 bard (2):<br>3 bard (3): cleave<br>4 bard (4): +1 str<br>5 bard (5):<br>6 rdd (1): knockdown*<br>7 rdd (2):<br>8 rdd (3): +1 str<br>9 rdd (4): toughness*<br>10 bg (1):<br>11 bg (2):<br>12 bg (3): +1 str, weapon focus (greatsword)<br>13 bg (4):<br>14 bg (5):<br>15 bg (6): improved knockdown**<br>16 bg (7): +1 str<br>17 bg (8):<br>18 bg (9): great cleave**<br>19 bg (10):<br>20 bard (6): +1 str<br><br>21 rdd (5): epic weapon focus (greatsword)<br>22 rdd (6):<br>23 rdd (7):<br>24 rdd (8): +1 str, blind-fight*<br>25 rdd (9):<br>26 rdd (10):<br>27 bg (11): divine shield*<br>28 bard (7): +1 str<br>29 bg (12):<br>30 bg (13): great charisma 1, epic prowess+<br>31 bg (14):<br>32 bg (15): +1 cha<br>33 bg (16): great charisma 2, armor skin+<br>34 bg (17):<br>35 bg (18):<br>36 bg (19): +1 cha, divine might**, epic toughness 1+<br>37 bg (20):<br>38 bg (21):<br>39 bg (22): great charisma 3, epic toughness 2+<br>30 bard (8): +1 cha<br><br>* optional but strongly recommended feat<br>** optional feat that can easily be changed for something else<br>+ blackguard epic bonus feat<br><br>Skills - max discipline, tumble, spellcraft, UMD, taunt.  9 perform +6 cha bonus = 15 for level 8 bardsong.<br><br>Spells - Whatever you want from level 1.

Or at least Overwhelming Crit?  Heck you don't even have improved crit!</b><br>A:  I felt that since this build can get reliable 7d6 sneak attacks off, anything that's not immune to them is going to be getting pounded badly enough that spending feats on crit-based offense would be overkill.  If you like crits and want dev crit, it's very easy to adapt this build to it.  The way I would do it is as follows:<br><br>Step 1 - Change Improved Knockdown to Improved Critical<br>Step 2 - Change Epic Prowess and Armor Skin to Overwhelming and Devestating Critical<br>Step 3 - Change Epic Toughness 1 and 2 to Epic Prowess and Armor Skin.<br><br><b>Q:  Why did you split your stat focus between Str and Cha?</b><br>A:  Because it provides a solid balance between offense and defense in the context of a blackguard character.  He gets his cha bonus to saving throws and can get it to AC - I view divine shield as more important than divine might in this build.  Rather than only being good at chopping people up, this character will make most of his saving throws and can get a very good AC for someone using a two handed weapon (thus leveraging the 150% strength bonus as well).<br><br><b>Q:  Why didn't you take Epic Fiendish Servant?</b><br>A:  It didn't fit my concept of the build, which was someone who enjoys doing his own dirty work.  I also question the value of most summons in epic levels, though I think the epic fiend is one of the top three.<br><br><b>Q:  Why not start with 12 int and 12 dex instead of 10 dex and 14 int?</b><br>A:  You can do this, it will cost you some skillpoints and you might not be able to completely max all the skills you want, but it will net you 1 additional AC point so it could be a very good tradeoff depending on your environment.  I didn't because the build doesn't have uncanny dodge, and I wanted to be fully certain that I had skillpoints at the end for everything.<br><br><b>Q:  Why not go sword-and-board instead of two handed?</b><br>A:  Because you've got a good AC potential with divine shield, and the ability to use scrolls of improved invisibility (or even take the displacement spell if you really want).  The two handed weapon leverages your strength bonus for offense against sneak-immune enemies (which you can buff pretty nicely with stacking bg/bard bull strength spells).  However if you plan on being a primary tank or are in an environment where higher AC is more important, it's certainly an option just change weapon focuses.<br><br>You can also combine going sword and board with changing to overwhelming or devestating criticals, and focusing in scimitar or rapier for additional threat.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 10/30/05 22:48</span></i></p>

I'm a Blackguard fan, and I appreciate a well-thought out BG build.  Well done, Xylo.  And I especially apreciate the Charisma slant he develops.

Hehe I put it in as a homage to Army of Darkness.  "Now listen up, you primitive screwheads!  THIS... is my... BOOOM STICK!"<br><br>I've become quite a blackguard fan myself, and this build is probably my favorite blackguard build.  I like how it synergizes with Bard and RDD in all respects - offense, defense, utility, and skills.<br><br>I guess the only reason I didn't take the epic fiend summon is because level 33 is the earliest you can get him with this build, and by that point in this build you'd be tanking for him, not having him tank for you.  However having him adds a capability you otherwise wouldn't have and you can easily sub him in at any of the blackguard bonus feat slots.<br><br>Edit - PS, I was thinking epic PM Demilich, epic SD Shadowlord, and and epic BG Vrock as the best three epic summons.  But still, there are many ways to have them unsummoned on you and with your UMD you can summon anything you want from a scroll (heck, cast your protection from alignment spell, then use a scroll to Gate in a Balor, he'll use firestorm and implosion for you).<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Xylophone on 10/18/05 03:49</span></i></p>

It's not that it works or doesn't work, it's that it needs 8d6 base sneak attack to be taken. Blackguard's sneak attack is different from the Rogue's (progresses every 3 levels after level 4 BG rather than every 2 levels from level 1) and they don't stack for that feat but they do for damage.

No, you need at least 1 dice of sneak attack for it to work, that means it doesn't work for the assassins death attack. It works for Blackies and Rogues.<br>Complete solution: You must have at least 1 rogue or 4 Blackie for it to work properly.

Yes he doesn't get enough sneak dice to qualify for improved SA.  Overwhelming Crit and Dev crit show up as BG bonus feats, however, so you can put them in there if you'd like.  Of course, the best save DC you can get is 41, so while it's certainly going to be useful in PvP and against cannon fodder style creature, I doubt it will land often on a PW where it's allowed and epic enemies are probably set up with high fort saves as a result.<br><br>Although that brings up an interesting point... if a PW balances against dev crit by giving its high end creatures very high fortitude saves, such that they only fail on a 1 even against a character with 40 base strength, then getting your save DC up doesn't matter - DC 50 or DC 27 you still only connect on a 1.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
