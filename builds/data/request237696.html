PM gains a slot at 3, 5, 7, and 9, which is less than a wizard/sorcerer, the thing is, I've seen that description as "those levels give it", not every 2 levels, so as I understand, over level 9 PM won't give you more spell slots, now this could be wrong, but when I've made casters with PM levels they end up with less slots.......<br><br>For feats, metamagic, maybe Spell focus an spell penetration feats, greats CHAs, some epic spells, although Epic Warding seems to be the only really great epic spell, the rest aren't so useful, Expertise and Improved Expertise are very good with casters.<br><br>I would suppose that more sorcerer levels would make you better against SR and more PM levels would ive you more AC.

What I was referring to was:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Every 2 levels, the pale master gains additional spells per day, as if they had leveled in their previous spell caster class. This gain only applies to spells per day and not caster level.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><i><br>Abilities<br>Boneskin (Level 1): +2 to natural armor class. Every four levels this increases by an additional +2.<br>Animate Dead (Level 2): Once per day can summon an undead servant.<br>Darkvision (Level 3): Able to see in the dark<br>Summon Undead (Level 4): Can summon more powerful undead.<br>Deathless Vigor (Level 5): Gains three additional hit points as per the feat Toughness.<br>Undead Graft (Level 6): Replaces arm with an undead version that twice per day can paralyze opponents. At level 8 an additional use per day is gained.<br>Tough as Bone (Level 7): : Immune to hold, paralyze, stun.<br>Summon Greater Undead (Level 9): Can summon a very powerful undead creature, once per day.<br><b>Deathless Mastery (Level 10): Immune to critical hits.</b><br>Deathless Master Touch (Level 10): The undead arm graft is replaced with this more deadly arm.
