Hiyas everyone,<br><br>I am new to NWN and AD&amp;D and I wanted to start a character that I could play thru NWN Platinum and do all the quests.  I believe a Druid/sorcerer will allow me to do all the quests as the high charisma can be used to persuade and the speak with animals and being a sorcerer will allow me to do the animal/magic ones.  I also like to have a dragon theme and eventually have dragon form, I also considered having a Druid 17, Sorcerer 18 and RDD 5 as a possibility.  This toon is not for PvP, only PvM, solo play for OC, SoU and HoTU.<br><br>I've got the following build and would like suggestions on how to improve him:  It's a weaker version of DragonKin, but I can cast lvl 9 druid spells.<br><br><br>Druid(17), Sorcerer(23), Human<br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 8<br>WIS: 17 (30)<br>INT: 10<br>CHA: 17 (19)<br><br>Take WIS for all except CHA at level 40.

I can't help you with the stats, but I can point out a fw things to you. If your going to have some rdd levels, take it all the wy up to level nine. Once you get to nine your character will sprout wings. The Druid has a special thing at level 5 called wildshape. As your druid grows stronger it will be able to turn into a dragon for an hr NWN time. At least thats what the books says.

I don't think I would take Zen Archery with a build like that.<br><br>Sorcerer levels will probably mean if you're fighting in range, you'll be using magic.<br><br>Druid levels allow you eventually have some forms that give you a melee presence.<br><br>Since you have access to a lot of spells maybe you should consider Craft Wand?  That way you can have some items to help you out when you're in trouble.
