I find that we have a gap of 2-3 weeks in our Wed schedule and so I again ask the mountain of experts here for fine, fine examples of Epic Builds that can be posted as Wed items:<br><br>If anyone has an Epic build for me I'll need a few things to get it ready to publish:<br><br>-A NWN character .bic file of the epic build at 20th and 40th level. It is helpful if the bic is labeled with a '20' and '40' in the .bic file title.<br>-A general write-up detailing what is special about the build, what the theme is. A more detailed write-up that includes advantages and disadvantages of the build. If the build has spellcasting I will need a list of recommended spells as well.<br><br>-An excel sheet that is constructed as the other epic builds we have listed so my webguy does not beat me.<br>This is a level by level prgession so people can see what choices were made and when.<br><br>If you can gather up those things and send them to me at <a href="mailto:jay@bioware.com">jay@bioware.com</a> I will start putting together a new run of epics! Thanks a bunch. If you are feeling really generous then put something like 'Epic Build' in the title to help me spot the latest emails.

Syrath, you should send the Shadow Archer if you haven't already.  I think that one deserves to be up there.<br><br>Steve

Aye, syrath1001, I'm looking at you. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I have his fine build which is more or less what this whole crazy ball rolling. <br><br>I remeber last time I got sent a variety of builds but some were just a word doc with general facts about a good build. As anyone who has submitted a build knows I don't personally create these builds and reserve my input to making some cool screenshots and maybe some additional color text for the intro if I do not receive any. The more complete the stuff I get is the easier it is for me to get the whole thing packaged up and sent over to Johnn the webguy to get it ready as it take quite a bit of time to mark-up these for the web I want to make the process as easy as I can for him and that means standard formats of excel sheet, .bics, a certain number of screens and so on.

That's not a slight on your build at all, mind you.  At least with, say, the reliable and bewildering archers, one had an emphasis purely on highest possible AB, while the other was designed to highlight more of the arcane side, using illusion spells.  Your build, while absolutely different, is still aiming at the same exact goal (highest sneak attack damage), and even if it does it a bit better, my hunch is that they'll favor a build that's more distinct from the previous ones.  But it can't hurt to try.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 05/02/05 22:42</span></i></p>

Someone please submit a good shifter build. I'd do it myself if I was any good at character building.
