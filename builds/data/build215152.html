Hi,<br><br>Nice layout - very easy to read. But you forgot to post your classes and levels in the thread title. No biggie, griphook will get it I'm sure.<br><br>As for your build, I have confusion and I have questions...<br><br>What do you do with 7 levels of Druid and 3 levels of Monk? Besides hide really well and move really quietly :/<br><br>Sorry, without more of a write-up I don't understand what this build is about. I don't play shifter druids so perhaps that's why I don't understand the intent of this build.<br><br>Is there some level 7 shapechange that you use and become a really wicked assassinating critter?<br><br>Please explain.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br>The people he knew were less than golden-hearted<br>Gamblers and robbers, drinkers and jokers, all soul searchers<br>Like you and me

Druid gets bonuses to hide outdoors. Also there are druid and ranger specific buffs like camoflauge, one with the land and mass camoflauge. Mass camoflauge is available at level 7 with the level 4 spells.
