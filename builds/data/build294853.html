John has a more simplistic morality than Robin's: a problem, sort it out. So John would choose to feed the poor on his doorstep before addressing a national threat. (Little John) is a man of few words, (but underneath that brute strength) hides a big heart … and (yet) he has an authority that the other members of the gang respect.” <br><br>See, BBC, Characters and Actors: Little John (2007), <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/robinhood/characters/littlejohn.shtml" target="_blank">Click Here</a>  </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Robin Hood had been a noble knight, serving the crusades, only to come home to England to find his lands had been stolen from him by the Sheriff of Nottingham on account of taxes allegedly owing but which were not in fact due. In finding himself suddenly homeless and without food, like so many of his countrymen at the time, Robin was bound and determined to end the people’s suffering, not only by feeding and clothing the poor and hungry, but to ultimately help the people by doing everything within his power to see King Richard returned to the throne (whose throne had been stolen from him by his evil relative, the Sorcerer King). Robin was out to do this not because Richard was the rightful ruler per se, but rather because he believed Richard to be a kind and just king who would end the people’s suffering and see to it that Sorcerer King and his evil minions paid for all the harm and suffering they were causing the people. Although Robin had found himself a loyal band of followers to assist him in his endeavors, namely, the Merry Band, he was lacking a strong and loyal second in command. <br><br>“Keeping order of a band of outlaws, enforcing the principle of giving to the poor what they took from the rich, would not have been an easy task. Robin came across the ideal man for the job in John Little, an excellent swordsman and archer who stood just over seven feet tall, with scrawny beard and unkempt hair. It was a brave man indeed who would dare face up to John Little. But to test his skills, that's just what Robin Hood had to do. Their initial encounter took place on a narrow bridge over a stream. Neither man would give way and let the other pass. Robin Hood drew his bow in anger. John thought him cowardly, having no bow himself, and challenged Robin to settle the dispute with quarterstaffs.<br><br>“A long hard fight ensued in which both parties took injury before Robin was finally defeated and thrown into the river. Will Scarlet and the rest of the outlaws then appeared from the forest, threatening to kill John Little. But Robin, recognising what a fine lieutenant John would make, invited him to join his merry band, and wear the Lincoln green. It was at this point that Will Scarlet gave John Little the name of Little John, the man destined to become Robin Hood's most loyal friend and second in command of the (Merry Wildwood Band ).<br><br>Source:  See, Robin Hood Blog (2008), <a href="http://robinhoodtree.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://robinhoodtree.blogspot.com/</a>    <br><br><br><br><i> The Build—Pros and Cons: </i><br><br>Has a really nice AB and good damage output (which you'll further enhance w. weaponry and/or UMD, and be sure to get yourself a mighty bow so as to enjoy all that barbarian grt.rage even more!). Bolstered by called shot, rapid shot, barb speed and terrifying rage (far better to peg off enemies with a bow when they’re terrified/running away from you, w. called shot nicely slowing them down, too, as opposed to having to chase after them w. a sword, enjoying a Terrifying Rage DC 52-62 (58-68 w. cha); has a nice enough defense, bolstered by called shot (slowing enemies whilst reducing their AB, hence raising your AC in turn), barb speed and uncanny dodge, too, with high HPs (over 600 naked, make that 700+ raging, which is exceptional on an archer, bolstered by barb DR/EDR III, thus soaking up the damage good, like Little John proper). While skills are rather thin and there’s no such thing as too much saves, saves are decent across the board (especially reflex but excepting will, but that will saves "savable" thanks to barb rage and full access UMD, too (which UMD/magic access is always nice for a barbarian to have, too); in turn, the combo makes for a very solid archer, true to the legends re: Little John, in all environs.

I like EDR Archers, and having TR on top was a good idea.  While I'm not going to comment on this version of "Little John" (Half-elf with a 10 Strength?), I will suggest a possible tweak to the build itself for low to mid level magic environments.  Start with a 16Dex and give yourself back 6 attribute points.  Put 4 into Int and 2 into Strength.  Then I would also increase Barb to 16 so that one can acquire that TR much earlier (Level 24ish).  Final split would be something like Barb16/Bard2/AA22 or Barb17/Bard2/AA21 (the latter granting another point of DR).  You end up losing some AB, but his AB is still so high I don't think it will be missed in the non-high magic envirnments.<br><br>Good work, Tyr.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Thanks, guys, glad you like it and always so good to hear <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">     <br><br>Apologize for the bit of delay on this one, but, heh, and then there was only one as they say (as in, Friar Tuck, who's in production and soon to make his debut: and not to worry, GD, don't wanna spoil the surprise, but thinking dwarf on that one (since we all know how much Tuck enjoyed his ale, yes?); ah, but they can't all be dwarves, GD <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    <br><br><i> Little as Archer/Half-Elf </i><br>As to Li'L John, focus here is on his archer side (since, unlike in NWN2, can't in NWN1 focus both on the staff and ranged (i.e., need str for the one, and dex for the other); meanwhile, to do justice to Li'L proper, being a legendary shot (thus legendary AB), has to be AA (nd AA = half-elf, w. 0 xp burden). Theme-wise, remember also that, in medieval times, many incl but not ltd to Scots and Scandinavians believed elf descended (aka half-elves) were of noble blood, be it royalty or other noble qualities; Little was of course Robin Hood's second-in-command, his Chief Lieutenant (w. Robin being of noble heritage as a former knight himself, whereas Little who cared more abt people than politics per se, truly of noble heart, and yet an outsider, so far as he lived in the woods w the merry band and thus an outlaw in the eyes of the law obv.). As to the staff beating he took b/f tossing Robin into the creek, well, that's where his discipline and EDR come in, yes? ); while staff battle's well known, it was his shot that was legendary. <br><br><i> ERD+Rage/TR </i><br>In one of the tales, he is said to have even beaten Robin, the greatest archer of all-time it is written, at an archery contest held b/w them to settle an argument, w. Robin putting the leadership of the band up in one version of the stories, but which Li'L even though he won the contest (or did Robin lose on purpose to make a point?), did not accept, insisting that Robin was the better leader and thus the one to lead the band, knowing Robin cared as he did for the people but had the skills and training to lead proper, thus settling their diff and ending once and for all the "leadership" contest as to who was the "better man for the job" (which "contest" arguably began when they first met and did battle w the staff, and we all know ab't Little shrugging off those blows, hence, Barb and EDR doth clearly speak to that: build-wise, I must admit it's rather sweet on an archer, I think so, too: and thanks! <br><br>And that TR, heh, that's not only fun, but also very practical, too, in all settings, I agree (thanks, Thax:  and comes soon enough, we're a level 40 build afterall, and thus we get there (patience, Thax, patience <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">   heh, I know: when we gets it, well, look out is alls I be saying, and yeah, it's kinda nice (thanx!);  meantime, as a raging AA w high AB, he just don't miss, so no worries while you wait <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   <br><br><i> An AA front-and-Center? (musing re: NWN2 v NWN1) </i><br>As most of you guys no doubt know, been spending a lot of time over on the NWN2 side (no, haven't abandoned you guys or anything, never, just helping out/contributing over on the other side of our home, that's all); ah, but no idea how nice it is for me to see AB/damage) on an AA (would't believe how they gutted ranged NWN2-30 (motb), relegated to the back end, sadly); that Li'L John here shoots em up, and does so pretty much everywhere, be it PvM or PvP and incl right up front and center of course, heh, brings tears of joy to me eyes, if you know what I be saying <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">     (thanks, guys: and yeah, finally got around to posting this one, Thax, sorry bout the delay, and glad you like!).<br><br><i> Alternate/Tweaks for low magic setting </i><br>As to your suggestions for low magic, GD, hmmm, yeah, I think so, too; could prob easily get away w that if you wanted to, I agree, as AB here as you say is no issue; in which case, if playing in such an environs, sure, and your 2nd option sounds good (i.e., letting you get in all that TR early etc., and a little extra DR while at it, too, which isn't too shabby at all, speaks to Thax' preference, too, I think so, and I likes). Wouldn't recommend it PvP or high(er) magic though, where no such thing as too much AB (then we know when it comes to AB that I'm rather addicted, right? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   And as the story goes, well, Li'L John didn't miss either <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   <br><br>Otherwise, thanks for the suggestion there, GD, appreciate it, and also appreciate everyone's great comments and kind praises, too: thank you (and good to see you guys, too! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Shoot/Feed the Poor ON! ~ Tyr<br><br>(and stay tuned, Robin Hood/Wildwood fans, got your PMs about it and not to worry: Friar Tuck is coming soon! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good [people] to do nothing" -- Edmund Burke, Philosopher and Politician (1729-1797)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 04/29/08 09:57</span></i></p>
