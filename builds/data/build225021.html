For my second attempt at a build, I want to start playing with something that seems not to have been done here before... That is, to make "pure" builds. Almost sounds like a contradiction in terms, but from a RP perspective, I like the idea of having one class and sticking to it, and I wanted to see if I could make some playable characters within the bounds of the game.<br><br>I'm starting with a fighter, because I figure that is the simplest to deal with.<br><br><b>Playable 1-40 Party PvM,</b> probably not do too well PvP (I say Party PvM because being a pure fighter is not very versatile. *WILL* need help in the form of henchpixels or party members!)<br><br>Aims:<br>* Strength based fighter. 2-handed fighter.<br>* Highly specialised in three weapons to cover all three damage types (no overlaps). Love the heavy flail (will be primary), can't go past Greatsword for slashing, and I decided to get point-blank shot and longbow rather than spear for piercing. Could have chosen rapier and just given up 1.5x STR bonus to damage in return for better crits.<br>* Try to make up for poor saves with saving throw feats.<br><br>Race: Human (Half-Orc or Dwarf could work if you could handle penalties on other abilities)<br>Alignment: Any, I'm playing as LN, just a disciplined, well-trained soldier.<br><br>STR: 18 (28)<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 16<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 10<br>CHA: 8<br><br>01: Fighter(1): Power Attack, Luck of Heroes, Weapon Focus: Heavy Flail<br>02: Fighter(2): Cleave<br>03: Fighter(3): Lightning Reflexes<br>04: Fighter(4): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Heavy Flail, (STR=19)<br>05: Fighter(5)<br>06: Fighter(6): Iron Will, Great Cleave<br>07: Fighter(7)<br>08: Fighter(8): STR+1, Knockdown, (STR=20)<br>09: Fighter(9): Point Blank Shot<br>10: Fighter(10): Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>11: Fighter(11)<br>12: Fighter(12): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Greatsword, Improved Critical: Heavy Flail, (STR=21)<br>13: Fighter(13)<br>14: Fighter(14): Improved Critical: Greatsword<br>15: Fighter(15): Toughness<br>16: Fighter(16): STR+1, Weapon Focus: Longbow, (STR=22)<br>17: Fighter(17)<br>18: Fighter(18): Great Fortitude, Weapon Specialization: Longbow<br>19: Fighter(19)<br>20: Fighter(20): STR+1, Improved Critical: Longbow, (STR=23)<br>21: Fighter(21): Epic Reflexes<br>22: Fighter(22): Overwhelming Critical: Heavy Flail<br>23: Fighter(23)<br>24: Fighter(24): STR+1, Epic Will, Epic Weapon Focus: Heavy Flail, (STR=24)<br>25: Fighter(25)<br>26: Fighter(26): Epic Weapon Specialization: Heavy Flail<br>27: Fighter(27): Overwhelming Critical: Greatsword<br>28: Fighter(28): STR+1, Devastating Critical: Heavy Flail, (STR=25)<br>29: Fighter(29)<br>30: Fighter(30): Overwhelming Critical: Longbow, Devastating Critical: Greatsword<br>31: Fighter(31)<br>32: Fighter(32): STR+1, Devastating Critical: Longbow, (STR=26)<br>33: Fighter(33): Epic Toughness I<br>34: Fighter(34): Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>35: Fighter(35)<br>36: Fighter(36): STR+1, Epic Toughness II, Epic Weapon Specialization: Greatsword, (STR=27)<br>37: Fighter(37)<br>38: Fighter(38): Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>39: Fighter(39): Epic Toughness III<br>40: Fighter(40): STR+1, Epic Weapon Specialization: Longbow, (STR=28)<br><br>Hitpoints: 620<br>Skillpoints: 129 [chose to max out Discipline (no brainer), Concentration and Lore (could choose heal or a crafting skill if you wanted)]<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 28/22/23<br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 42 (melee), 33 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 10/21<br><br>Pros:<br>* Strong.

Lore is a waste of skillpoints, and concentration can be useful against taunt but there are better skills to get. What about spellcraft and tumble?

I like the idea of purist builds but you say fighter is the easiest to deal with? Most mage builds are easy to do for 40.. just add more great Ints/Chas in and you've got it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  Loving a decent pure 40 fighter though.. that's something that's actually interesting as well as fun ^_^<br><br>-DaMouse

Actually I question myself the heavy investment in longbow, your AB with it simply sucks. It would make sense with a dexer, but in this case I see it as a waste of feats basically. I'd choose another weapon or change starting stats and get IKD, disarm and imp.disarm expertise and imp.expertise instead of the feats spent on longbow<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 12/25/05 21:39</span></i></p>

Why don't you drop two fighter levels in epic and take 2 rogue levels?  You lose 1 feat, but gain 8 AC, and the ability to pick locks, and other rogue skills.  Also, why not add CoT?  You get better saves, same bab, same feats... It just doesn't make sense to me why you would only get 40 fighter...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Veridious on 12/26/05 02:35</span></i></p>

If you're to drop the crit feats on one weapon, make it the heavy flail. Usually, one switches to a blundgeoning weapon to take out opponents resistant to slashing and/or piercing weapons, and it happens that most of the time, these particular opponents are undead and thus immune to critical hits. <br><br>Better go with the greatsword for the crit feats, and for the piercing weapon, grab the rapier. It will serve as your high crit range weapon and allow you to pick up a shield to raise your AC while still maintaining a good damage output thru the crits.

For more flexibility, I would choose one two-handed weapon and one single-handed for use with a shield. I would keep the heavy flail as he two-hander, and skip the crit feats on it (use it against the crit-immune, with the 1.5x str bonus making up for the loss of crits). Pick something with a high crit range for the one-handed weapon (scim or rapier), and put the IC/OC/DC series on that one. Use it against thing that are vulnerable to crits, or against things where you need the extra AC from a shield.<br><br>TM

He's still a 2-handed fighter - when he uses the heavy flail. He's also a 1-handed fighter when he uses the scim or rapier. <br><br>To me, the only real benefit to so many fighter levels is the flexibility from all those feats. He chose to use them for 3 weapons, one of each damage type, but all 2-handed. It makes more sense to me to include not only different damage types, but also a 1-hander for the shield option. Giving the 1-hander the crit feats makes up for the lower str bonus, and the 2-hander will use the 1.5x str multiplier to compensate for lack of crits on the crit-immune enemies. And I always like having a shield option against those guys that hit really hard - an extra 9 AC can make a big difference in your survivability, not to mention some of the nice resistances or ability buffs various shields have on them.<br><br>TM

Tower Shield +6 gives +9 to AC (I would consider that to be medium-magic at level 40). <br><br>And I am not counting on them, merely allowing the character to take advantage of them if they exist.

A tower shield +6 looks like <i>high magic</i> to me... but I come from PnP after all <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Well, it's a matter of taste. I generally consider low magic worlds to be limited to +3 or less, medium magic to +6 or less, and high magic to be +7 up (usually +10). Of course, I am also assuming that they are given in a level-dependent manner (i.e. 5th level characters should not have access to the most powerful items on the PW, but 40th level characters should, be they +3 or +20...).<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 01/05/06 14:03</span></i></p>
