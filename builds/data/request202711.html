I need help to make up my mind for a Treekin Char. on a RP server. (treekin are decendants of tree ents).The level cap is 40, but its tough to get there, its a little easier to get to 20 and its a somewhat low-magic world. <br><br>I was thinking maybe monk/druid/barb... druid (nature-lover) / monk (has training and yet doesnt abuse his abilities) /  and barb (when someone hurts his home..the forest...he enters a rage) . <br><br> Any suggestions are welcome and appreciated <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

It cant be monk/druid/barb because monk needs to be lawful and barb needs to be unlawful.<br><br>Druid has a nice spell that can simulate the barbarian rage:<br>Blood Frenzy (From the grimoire)<br>Caster Level: Druid 2<br>Innate Level: 2 School: Transmutation<br>Component(s): V, S Range: Personal<br>Save: None Spell Resistance: No<br>Area of Effect/Target: Caster<br>Duration: 1 round / level<br>Description: The caster enters a rage similar to that of a barbarian. The caster gains a +2 bonus to Constitution and Strength and a +1 bonus to Will saves, while suffering a -1 penalty to AC.<br><br>You dont really need anything else than druid and monk, but if you wish you can always take Fighter for specializing in kama and get dual wielding feats OR CoT if you want to avoid the xp penalty that would come with fighter.<br><br>I would, better than using kamas give him zen archery, point black shot, rapid shot and called shot (you need, a minimum of 13 dex for this) and heavily focus on wisdom for spellcasting, AC and AB (And being able to fall out to his fists if he needs to melee).<br><br>I would go:<br>Human (Or half elf, for avoiding the xp penalty and extra feats and skills).<br><br>6 Fighter/6 Monk/28 Druid<br><br>Pre-epic:<br> 1monk =&gt; (Monk wisdom AC (you should start with high wis)<br> 1fighter (Martial proficiency + Weapon focus longbow)<br> 1druid<br> 1monk =&gt; Take tumble to 10<br> 1fighter (Bonus feat)<br> 4druid<br> 1monk =&gt; Take tumble to 15<br> 1fighter<br> 4druid<br> 1monk =&gt; Take tumble to 20<br> 1fighter (weapon specialization longbow)<br> 3druid<br><br>Epic:<br> 1fighter =&gt; EWF longbow<br> 10druid<br> 1monk =&gt; Take tumble to 35<br> 1fighter =&gt; EWS longbow<br> 5druid<br> 1monk =&gt; Max discipline and put tumble to 40<br> 1druid =&gt; Max spellcraft and any other druid skill<br><br>This would make a good druid/monk archer, with 120% speed, decent AB, good AC and some spells. 4(5 with rapid shot) ranged attacks and 6(7 with flurry) melee attacks per round(with low AB) + IKD.<br>_________________<br>Over Seven Years of High Quality RP. <a href="http://www.mytharria.org" target="_blank">www.mytharria.org</a> We offer a unique world with player based religions &amp; governments.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By fernandooa on 07/06/05 07:45</span></i></p>
