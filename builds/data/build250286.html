I have to admit that with nwn2 just around the corner, i havent been too focused on any of my own builds for nwn.  I was walkin in my house tonight with my short stick and I started to think "i wonder what a stick user could be like in nwn".   I thought MONK!!  But not all monk cuz they dont get bonus' for staves.  Then i thought fighter too!  Then I thought against it.  Weapon master is really better!  And the concept for this is a martial artist, which sorta works with weaponmaster/monk.  <br><br>So, what would I take for the 2rd class? Fighter?  again NO.  To obvious!  And i hate playin pure meleeists.  Lookin thru my options, the one I was drawn too is...  CLERIC!!  Big surprise, right!  But this is why:  I wanted to have EXTRA damage that I could have access to if I needed it.  I took 12 cleric over 15 for the +4 vs +5.  I really didnt think loosin 3 wm lvs was worth the +1 damage.   <br><br>So there you have it.  cleric12/monk6/wm22 using the most bestest weapon of all (yeah yeah, but let me ask you, what weapon could you walk down a street with IN THE REAL WORLD and NOT get arrested for carrying!!!  jk)<br><br>The way this build is designed, having the cleric lvls at the start, this build is playable from 1-40 pvm.  That said, having to take monk lvls throughout for skill dumps (boy am i gonna miss those!!) you will not have access to ikd until 40.  This is, for some, a negative, but to keep the concept it has to be done this way.<br><br>Race  Human<br>Alignment  Lawful (neutral)<br><br>Start (end)<br><br>Str 15 (30)<br>Dex 14<br>Con 10<br>Wis 15 (16)<br>Int 14<br>Cha 08<br><br><br>Leveling<br><br>01 monk1    dodge/ mobility<br>02 cleric1    [heal/strength]<br>03 cleric2  wf: quarterstaff<br>04 cleric3     wis 16<br>05 cleric4 (intimidate 4cc)<br>06 cleric5  expertise<br>07 monk2<br>08 cleric6     str 16<br>09 cleric7  spring attack<br>10 cleric8<br>11 cleric9<br>12 cleric10  whirlwind  str 17<br>13 wmstr1   &lt;wpn of choice&gt;<br>14 wmstr2<br>15 wmstr3  imp crit: quaterstaff<br>16 wmstr4   str 18<br>17 wmstr5   &lt;inc multi&gt;<br>18 wmstr6  extend spell<br>19 wmstr7   &lt;ki crit&gt;<br>20 wmstr8   str19<br><br>21 cleric11  gr stI<br>22 monk3  &lt;tumble25&gt;<br>23 cleric12<br>24 wmstr9   gr stII st 22<br>25 wmstr10   <br>26 wmstr11<br>27 monk4 &lt;tumble30&gt; gr strIII<br>28 wmstr12  str 24<br>29 wmstr13  ewf: quarterstaff<br>30 wmstr14  gr strIV<br>31 wmstr15<br>32 monk5 &lt;tumble35&gt;  str 26<br>33 wmstr16  gr strV / epic prowess<br>34 wmstr17<br>35 wmstr18<br>36 wmstr19  str29  gr strVI / Armor skin<br>37 wmstr20<br>38 wmstr21<br>39 wmstr22  *toughness / epic toughnessI<br>40 monk6 &lt;ikd&gt; str 30<br><br>* could also take esf:dis if you like<br><br>Skills: Tumble 40, intimidate 4(cc8)lv 5, spellcraft 25(clericlv23) +160 left<br><br>HP (96cl + 220wm + 48monk + 20etI +40toughness)= 424<br><br>AC 26 nekkid<br><br>AB 45/40/35/30  (BAB26)<br>damage d6+15 (17-20*3)<br><br>Fort 22 Reflex 24 Will 25<br><br>THe domains I took were str and healing.  WHy?  The way you play this dude is buff and party!  The 2 biggest assests are div fav + power!  THis gives you +4dam/+7ab!  This is why I took cleric over fighter.  There are others you can try, but these are your mains.  I play with first/second slots with div fav.  3rd/4/5 all can be divpwers and lv 6 are harms/heals.  Taking heal allows you to put heals lv 5 harms lv 6 for 3 each if you like.   I would take trickery if I were to play this guy through cuz I think trickery is the most essential domain for a cleric, but thats me.  The others, well I have never found any use for (not even magic or travel.. not a huge caster, and haste is on itms where i play, and 12 cl lvs doesnt give the duration anyway).  The only other I really like is Plant!  But since you get no slots past 6, why bother!  Just my 2 cents though.<br><br>So there you have it.

I would go for Cleric 15 instead.  Divine Favor, Magic Vestments and GMW cap out at that level so you get +5 instead of +4, and I think the extra duration and spells would be worth it (even if you don't raise your wisdom for the 7 and 8 spells).   Cleric 15 is one of those sweet spots, like bard 16.  That would be my only complaint against this build, other than that it looks good.  Well done Avado.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Yes, I was fussing that.  YOu could drop wm to 19 and get cleric to 15 that way.  If you really didnt mind, you could actually take cleric near lv 40, say 39 or so to get spellcraft to 40ish.  Doing this looses you the epic toughness..

RP-wise it all makes sense, and it becomes a good result. Just note that DP can only give you fighters BAB, it is not dependent upon the Cleric level per se. So it goes from 27 to 30, giving +3 here.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Funny thing is, when I tested it just now, I got +5 to ab from both div fav and power..

Test it again, because with this level-split you won't.

Interesting, and nicely done <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      <br><br>As to DP, as we discussed on my cleric archer, what it does is transfer your BAB to that of the fighter of a same level, in other words, takes you to pre-ep BAB 20, and kicks up your AB across the board in turn by the same amount (and only) as it kicked up your BAB . To fully exploit this neat cleric trick (and get ie +5 AB) you gotta keep your pre-epic BAB to 15 so that, when DP is hit, it will give you the +5 across the board, and also that fourth attack (like a ftr which, if you were (but are not) a cleric w. pre-ep 15, you'd be lacking); the really nice and special bonus of DP being that, when it's hit, that extra attack it otherwise gives comes in not like a typical ftr, but at the highest AB level (in other words, at the same AB of your first), but ONLY if your base is raised high enough (for this to occur, you need to bring BAB down to pre-ep 15, which you can do by ie. adding more pre-ep cleric). <br><br>Either way, though, cool musings and really neat twist(totally!) ~ Cheers, Tyr<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 08/20/06 06:41</span></i></p>

Yeah, the thing is, on the first version, I ended with 16bab/26.  Havin only +4 from DP, I was gettin the 30, like you said.  I adjusted it to get 15 cleric lvls and there it is...  +4.   I am not sure why its not 17 on my version, but i know stranger things have happened.  Thanks grim.<br><br>I really gotta wonder why on earth people make clerics with 4apr.
