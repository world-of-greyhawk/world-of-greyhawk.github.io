<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 PvM</b><br><br>This is a build idea that came to me while I was working around the house this weekend.

Nice build, Kaliban.  His DR is 18/-.  It was a good idea to use the symmetry offreed by a 9/5/26Combo.  Gets great saves, too.  He appears like he might take some time to mature.  Perhaps by stopping with DwD 22, you can devote some more resources to Monk levels, raise your AC, speed, get Epic Dodge much earlier, and pick up some SR on top of it.  You only lose 3/- DR and Epic Toughness.<br><br>Also, gotta love the hitpoints this Epic Dodging Dwarf gets.  Tempered Steel, indeed!  Well done.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 07/18/05 04:07</span></i></p>

He doesn't get Epic Dodge until level 39, so you had better be a patient player (or play on a fast-level PW). The original version I sketched out was Monk 10/DD 25/SD 5 - that permitted Epic Dodge at level 27 or 30 I think, then a final monk level late in life to maximize tumble. But I really wanted the build to maximize his DwD AB and DR so pushed for that last final bonus feat level of Dwd (26). The Monk 9/SD 5 synergy comes of course from the instruction you gave me on my Kama Fury build. <br><br>You have good points that going with more Monk would make the build a little more playable, definitely qualify for Epic Dodge earlier, and definitely alter the flavor from this posted version of Tempered Steel. Perhaps I'll write up a Monk 13/DwD 22/SD 5 version.....perhaps I'll name it.....................
