Originally, I wanted him to be dex-based, using light, accurate attacks to bleed an enemy to death very quickly.  My first horrible attempt at that concept was the Twinblade build, which was not only impracticable, but impossible to create.  I got some expert advice from folks here (thanks!) and started over.  In experimenting with how to fix the Twinblade, I realized that, in the NWN setup, the dex-based idea conflicted with the original offensive/defensive mix I envisioned.  Then, exploring a suggestion from grizzled_dwarflord and looking at Mithdradates’s Pillager build, I rebuilt him as a str-based fighter/wm.  This came MUCH closer to what I’d originally intended.  In fact, in reviewing the build, I realized that I’d gone too far… there was no way that build would survive any combat involving an enemy caster or a large group of enemy melee types (though it was <i>awesome</i> in the AoC).  So I backed off of the 100% offensive f/wm (who had 53AB while dual-wielding, but zero defensive capacity… I’ll post it if anyone wants to see it), and I threw in a Bard level based on responses to Kaliban99’s Two-Fisted Weaponmaster build as well as great input from several sources in response to the original version of this build.  Along the way, the build acquired a bit of personality.  Thus, I give you:<br><br><br><b>The Humming Hurricane of Horror</b><br>Fighter 11/Weapon Master 28/Bard 1<br>Human, Any non-lawful alignment<br><br>The Humming Hurricane of Horror (aka “Triple H” or “huhh?”) is a member of a distant and very solitary society of fighters.  Their training regimen ignores all external considerations to focus on mastery of their unique two-weapon fighting style, which uses short, heavy blades to literally hack apart enemies. They are further characterized by their mysterious and disturbing tendency to hum merrily while thus dismembering their opponents.  A long-forgotten bard watching a Hurricane fight a group of his enemies (from well outside his splatter range) gave the society its ‘public’ name; no one has ever been able to determine what the Hurricanes call themselves.<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>Strength	16<br>Dexterity	15<br>Constitution	14<br>Intelligence	14<br>Wisdom	8<br>Charisma	8<br><br>Progression:<br>1 ) Fighter 1 – Dodge, Weapon Proficiency: Exotic, Weapon Focus (Kukri)<br>2 ) Fighter 2 – Mobility<br>3 ) Fighter 3 – Expertise<br>4 ) Fighter 4 – Weapon Specialization (Kukri)<br>5 ) Fighter 5<br>6 ) Fighter 6 – Whirlwind Attack, Spring Attack<br>7 ) Fighter 7<br>8 ) Fighter 8 – Two-Weapon Fighting<br>9 ) Fighter 9 – Ambidexterity<br>10) Fighter 10 – Power Attack<br>11) Weapon Master 1<br>12) Weapon Master 2 – Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>13) Weapon Master 3 <br>14) Weapon Master 4<br>15) Weapon Master 5 – Improved Critical (Kukri)<br>16) Weapon Master 6<br>17) Weapon Master 7<br>18) Weapon Master 8 - Cleave<br>19) Weapon Master 9<br>20) Weapon Master 10<br>21) Weapon Master 11 – Great Cleave<br>22) Weapon Master 12<br>23) Weapon Master 13 –Epic Weapon Focus (Kukri)<br>24) Fighter 11 – Epic Weapon Specialization (Kukri)<br>25) Weapon Master 14<br>26) Weapon Master 15<br>27) Weapon Master 16 – Great Strength 1, Epic Prowess<br>28) Weapon Master 17<br>29) Weapon Master 18<br>30) Weapon Master 19 – Great Strength 2, Overwhelming Critical<br>31) Weapon Master 20<br>32) Weapon Master 21 <br>33) Weapon Master 22 – Great Strength 3, Armor Skin<br>34) Weapon Master 23<br>35) Weapon Master 24 <br>36) Weapon Master 25 – Great Strength 4, Epic Toughness 1<br>37) Weapon Master 26<br>38) Bard 1<br>39) Weapon Master 27 – Toughness<br>40) Weapon Master 28 – Epic Toughness 2<br><br>Final Stats:<br>Strength 30<br>Dexterity 15<br>Constitution 14<br>Intelligence 14<br>Wisdom 8<br>Charisma 8<br><br>Final Skills (Modified)<br>Perform 4 (3)<br>Discipline 43 (45)<br>Intimidate 4 (3)<br>UMD 41 (40)<br>Tumble 40 (42)<br>Spellcraft 38 (40)<br>Heal 43 (42)<br><br>Final Saves (vs. Spells):<br>Fortitude 22 (30)<br>Reflex 22 (30)<br>Will 15 (23)<br><br>BAB (plain kukri, dual-wielding): 49<br>Base AC: 22<br>Max HP: 556<br><br>Damage Bonus per-hit: 16<br>Crit Threat Range (plain kukri): 13-20<br>Crit Multiplier: x3<br>Crit Dmg Bonus: 2d6<br>Avg Dmg per round (plain kukri): 217<br><br>This build has a TON of offensive melee power, but retains moderate saves (except will), moderate AC, and good hp.

SovranSpecific,<br><br>Sorry to bring bad news...but I have to tell you, your general feats are off a level after level 24. You've got them every three levels starting at 26, but it should it be starting at 27.<br><br>And WM gets bonus feats at WM 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, and 28.<br><br>Looks like it's just a typo.

See, this is what happens when you think you can modify a legal build "just a little bit" without re-testing it in a leveler mod.  I'll fix it again.

Time for some good old-fashioned number crunching.  The choice in this build comes down to<br>1) 50 AB, 17 dmg bonus, no overwhelming critical<br>2) 49 AB, 16 dmg bonus, with overwhelming critical<br><br>With a kukri at 17dmg bonus and no OCrit, you get an average of 222 damage per round, or 117 damage per round against crit-immune targets, assuming no misses.<br><br>With a kukri at 16dmg bonus and <i>with</i> OCrit, you get an average of 230 damage per round, or 111 damage per round against crit-immune targets, assuming no misses.<br><br>So, first, is 8 dmg/rnd vs. crit-able targets worth losing 6 dmg/rnd vs. crit-immune targets?<br><br><br>Then, it gets more interesting when you consider the Two-Bladed Sword option.<br><br>With a TBS at 17dmg bonus and no OCrit, you get an average of 219 damage per round, or 129 damage per round against crit-immune targets, assuming no misses.<br><br>With a TBS at 16dmg bonus and <i>with</i> OCrit, you get an average of 224 damage per round, or 123 damage per round against crit-immune targets, assuming no misses.<br><br>So it boils down to this (if I can get it to look right):<br>________Kuk16__Kuk17__TBS16__TBS17<br>crit______230____222____224____219<br>non-crit__111____117____123____129<br><br>So if you take the route that maximizes crit damage, you're looking at 230 d/r for the kukri and 224 d/r for the TBS.  The corresponding non-crit dmg is 111 for the kukri and 123 for the TBS.  So, again, is 6 crit damage worth losing 12 non-crit damage?  If not, then TBS is a better choice than kukri.<br><br>Obviously, the answer depends on what you're fighting.  For portions of the OC or PWs with lots of undead and crit-immune bosses, the TBS is probably better.  If you're in an area with few crit-immune targets, then Kukris are worth it.  What do you think?  Any errors in my logic here?<br><br>BTW, the short sword is completely inferior to either TBS or Kukri.  Which is pretty much what you guys all told me.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
