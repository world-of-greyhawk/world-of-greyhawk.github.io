Why the 14 DEX?  All it nets you is +1 AC, and imo +42(43?) skill points is more crucial when you have 0 concentration and 0 discipline. <br><br>Also, in a low to mid magic world where AB isn't such a big factor, I'd consider dropping 2 Great STR feats for a Great CON and a Great WIS (net +1 AC, +40 HPs, +1 Will and Fortitude save at the cost of 1 AB/damage).<br><br>But all in all, a very nice looking build. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Edit:  I also might consider moving Monk to post-epic and taking a 4th Dwarven Defender pre-epic in modules where Divine Power's extra APR is removed.  Going for Greatsword would cost 3 APR but give you +2 AB (assuming you're using Flurry of Blows) and +3 damage (+6 with maxed STR).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By mantis3 on 03/16/07 17:44</span></i></p>

13 DEX is a requirement for Dodge. Dodge is a requirement for Dwarven Defender class, 14 to make it even, no change possible there.<br><br>+1 AC and 40 HP on such a tank? his defense is quite strong as it is, sorry, I prefer the 1 AB and damage.<br><br>Your point on skills is noted, I don't like not having Discipline... even if my AC can outmatch the Discipline, a melee shouldn't be so easy to Knockdown or Disarm... I can't lower more than 1 stat in DEX, but I could lower initial WIS or CON (since it's spending 2 points) for INT and make it up on epics changing Great STR feats... I'm not sure if Concentration is really worth it though.<br><br>The Divine Power thing is troublesome, one more APR with pre-epic BAB of 16 is quite viable, but that sixth APR becomes the lowest AB as well, it won't hit reliably, I know that by having Haste and Flurry, Divine Power exploit isn't excelling either...<br><br>Please don't even mention a change of weapon or I'll get angry at you, kama is the best weapon on a Monk in 99% of the builds, this included (I argue about this on any build that uses monk without kama, 8 APR beats 5, maths don't lie). There is no AB loss since nobody forces me to use Flurry, I use it because it's a useful feat, it grants more damage, and with this STR score two handed bonus damage is quite useless.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/17/07 02:21</span></i></p>

Well, it's more about that it's going much beyond the build topic itself, I leave the weapon choice kama with no reasonable variant for this build in particular, if you actually try to make such a build where even monk will end better with another weapon you'll definitely be able, because that's not a challenge and it's not related to this.<br><br>The points you give for a non-kama monk do not apply for this build, with a base Wisdom of 19 buffable to 21-24 taking Armor and Shield will give only a slight boost, if any, damage output from a Greatsword is greater than a kama, obviously, but you'll make 5 APR instead of 8, and it will be less playable to use a greatsword while leveling.<br><br>The link to my Dwarven Abomination is up there, which is a pretty similar build, in that one you could change weapon with considerable ease and no objections from my part. Notice it becomes a waste to even take monk if you're going with a Greatsword, but it's quite a good option if it is for a Fighter with EWS.

Huh, dual wield version? now that's going to be hell hard, I'd need a higher DEX (might even go full DEX based, then no Greatsword ideas will spring, however, I think DEX based is useless when you have DR) but... it won't be worth it, this build is quite starved just as it is, dual wielding will make me lose important feats, I'd have to take off 2 Great Strengths and Improved Critical, which will net a lower AB at any rate.<br><br>You can do it and it will be strong, no doubt about it, but I don't think it will be better.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/29/07 15:11</span></i></p>
