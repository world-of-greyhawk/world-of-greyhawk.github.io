Avoiding some of the complexities of the the zen claric of mixing casting with archery I decided to go simple with this one. First off this is a human build to try and match an Arcane Archer well it's easy to see it falls a little short of over all to hit it does come close to the damage almost prevailing depending on the build. I add in mounted for speed and style and no need for a haste item. The Paladin Mount can be dropped and monk taken much later in the build for a tumble drop but the AC will be about the same with the mounted combat feat the down side to focusing on taking the mount is losing the haste AC and -4 to attack bonus using the mount being -2 and rapid shot being another -2. If you feel like dropping the riding portion and rapid shot just take Knockdown and Improved Knockdown of other combat style you prefer maybe like call shot or drop human and place in anyother race that you prefer.<br><br>Anyway toward making the build…<br><br><br><br><b>Riding Archer - Paladin (14), Champion of Torm (25) Monk (1) </b><br><i>Human, Lawful Good</i><br><i>PvM build/Great only against Caster Types in PvP CR 37</i><br><br><br><br>ABILITIES <i>(ending)</i><br>STR: 13<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 10<br>WIS: 16 (26) <br>INT:  10<br>CHA: 14 (24) <br><br><br><b>BASIC STATS</b><br>Hitpoints: 398<br>Skillpoints: 131<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Reflex/Will): 42/39/43<br>BAB: 30<br>AB: 42/37/32/27<br>AC (naked or mundane platemail/on horse back): 19/27<br><br><br><b>SKILLS</b><br>Discipline 43 (44)<br>Ride 43 (44)<br>Taunt 43 (50)<br>Remaining Points 2<br><br><br><b>Ability points:</b><br><br>Charisma all levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40.<br><br><br><b>LEVELING GUIDE</b><br>Character Level- Class (Class level): Feats<br>1 Pal (1) Power Attack, Weapon Focus<br>2 Pal (2) <br>3 Pal (3) Zen Archery<br>4 Pal (4) CHA +1 (CHA 15)<br>5 Pal (5)<br>6 Pal (6) Point Blank Shot<br>7 Pal (7)<br>8 Pal (8) CHA +1 (CHA 16)<br>9 Pal (9) Divine Might<br>10 Pal (10)<br>11 Pal (11)<br>12 Pal (12) Divine Shield, CHA +1 (CHA 17)<br>13 Pal (13)<br>14 CoT (1)<br>15 CoT (2) Mounted Combat, Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>16 CoT (3) CHA +1 (CHA 18)<br>17 CoT (4) Improved Critical Longbow<br>18 CoT (5) Mounted Archery<br>19 CoT (6) Rapid Shot<br>20 CoT (7) CHA +1 (CHA 19)<br><i>(Epic)</i><br>21 Monk (1) Epic Weapon Focus Longbow<br>22 CoT (8) Epic Prowess<br>23 CoT (9)<br>24 CoT (10) Great Wisdom I, Great Wisdom II (WIS 18), CHA +1 (CHA 20)<br>25 CoT (11) <br>26 CoT (12)<br>27 CoT (13) Great Wisdom III (WIS 19)<br>28 CoT (14) Great Wisdom IV (WIS 20), CHA +1 (CHA 21)<br>29 CoT (15)<br>30 CoT (16) Great Wisdom V (WIS 21)<br>31 CoT (17) <br>32 CoT (18) Great Wisdom VI (WIS 22), CHA +1 (CHA 22)<br>33 CoT (19) Great Wisdom VII (WIS 23)<br>34 CoT (20) <br>35 CoT (21)<br>36 CoT (22) Great Wisdom VIII, Great Wisdom IX (WIS 25), CHA +1 (CHA 23)<br>37 CoT (23) <br>38 CoT (24)<br>39 CoT (25) Great Wisdom X (WIS 26)<br>40 Pal (14) CHA +1 (CHA 24)<br><br><br><b>Buffs</b><br>Bless, Divine Favor, Aid, Aura of Glory, Eagle’s Splendor, Prayer, Freedom of Movement and Death Ward<br><br>AB On Horse Back: 40/35/30/25<br>AB With Rapid Shot: 38/33/28/23<br>AB Buffs: Divine Wrath +11, Bless +1, Aid +1, Prayer +1, and Divine Favor +4 = +18<br>Damage Buff: 1-6 pierce, +1 slash, +4 magic, and +21-22 divine = 27-33 CriticalRange: 19-20/x3 = 81-99<br>AC Divine Shield: +10-11<br><br>I'll post option two for those that want more monk as well and decide to drop the mount.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 03/21/09 16:50</span></i></p>

Looks good.  I would place Monk1 at Level22 for the Tumble dump, and probably drop CoT25 for Monk2 at Level37.  Divine Wrath is only 1x a day anyway, but +8AC is forever.  The saves are dynamite in ths kind of build.  When you turn on Divine Might, Divine Wrath and Rapid Shot with a little Haste, I can't think of too many bosses that can wistand the arrow onslaught coming down.

Nice build. Not sure what I'd alter at first glance at least. What I'd like to see is your Spellslots. Should be quite decent, shouldn't it? Never tried, but does smite work with arrows?

Same amount of feats, a bit lesser saves, but quite more spell slots, a bit longer duration for some. CHA buffing spells are really nice at least, and Divine Favor(and even GMW for when it's needed) will max at +5. In addition I'd consider Extend spell, to cast extended Divine Favors. Paladin Buffs are really underestimated compared to Cleric by quite many people. Able to self-buff by 13, or 8 +  weapon in your case in addition to the CHA buffs. This build will be a great damage dealer, and not just during Divine Wrath.

I'm pretty sure that the modifier will affect your Tumble checks, but it won't subtract your Tumble AC.  Only by modifying the scripts can one achieve the actual loss of that AC, at least that was my take when I examined Proleric's Horse Guide.  Think of it like armor.  I can wear Full Plate and Tower Shield and receive a huge hit to my Tumble modifier, but if I have 40 ranks in Tumble I still get my +8AC.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Nope a mistake on my part when I tested this build I did a huge tumble drop out of habit that I am now trying to break. The bonus AC on the mount ether doesn't show or instant supported yet.<br><br>What does this all mean well I was wrong in assuming the ride bonus was always present while on the mount and that tumble boost to AC are still effective. The other thing is anyone looking to get more tumble might want to speculate getting higher Int or Drop Taunt or Discipline.<br><br>The way the mounted combat feat describes the affect is every turn you roll for AC and get a bonus 1 for every 5 you roll on your ride check so having high dex could amount to even higher AC if someone felt like dropping the Wisdom portion of the build and keep it typical archery style for more AC but you lose out on CoT bonus wisdom. If the feat works like it's suppost to this also means that you get 8 more AC per-turn plus what ever you roll on your ride check<br><br>BTW Thanks for making me research my build to fill in some holes<br><br>If mounted combat sounds iffy still, which it starting to sound to me, then the second build is the safer bet<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By VectorZulu on 09/13/08 16:42</span></i></p>
