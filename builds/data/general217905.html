This said let me try answering your question.<br>DC for stunning fist is 10 + 1/2 char.lvl + WIS mod<br>Starting with WIS 18 and taking all the stats increase in wisdom plus Great Wis X will net you 38 Wis. Stats enhancements are capped at +12 so the maximum theoretical Wis is 50, which means a +20 bonus. Add Improved Stunning Fist feat: each time you take it nets you +2 DC up to a maximum of +20. So the math goes:<br>DC= 10 (base DC) + 40/2 (1/2 char.lvl) + 20 (WIS mod) + 20 (10 Imp.Stunn.Fist) = 70<br>Theoretically it's therefore possible. I have to check out whether you can level something like this anyhow. CoT seems to be necessary in epic lvls to pump up WIS with the bonus feats.<br>Cheers<br><br>....    ....    ....    ....    ....    ....    ....    ....    ....<br><br><i>Cinnabar Din</i><br><br>Peter, read <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=455388&amp;forum=42&amp;sp=15" target="_blank">This Thread</a>.

Improved Stunning Fist also needs 19 Dex and Wis.  I used the character generator and calculated a DC 58 stuning fist (no magic items or buffs).<br><br>final stats were <br><br>human Monk 40:<br><br>STR: 8<br>DEX: 16 (19)<br>CON: 8<br>WIS: 18 (26)<br>INT: 12<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Quivering Palm dc was 37<br><br>BAB = 25<br><br>(weapon finness taken)<br>(weapon focus US)<br>(improved critical US)<br>(extra Stunning Attack)<br><br>This is a seriously bad build since 10 epic feats were used in Improved Unarmed Strike and 1 for Greater Wisdom.<br>(you only get 11 feats for a monk between 21-40)<br><br>Taking IUS gives 2 to the DC, taking Greater Wisdom is a slower DC booster since it's 2 feats for +1 DC increase.<br><br>So, items and potions would add +12 to your WIS mod.  (or is that a +12 point boost so only +6 WIS modifier?)<br><br>Thus, 70DC is possible at the expence of being able to actually hit something that is lvl 40 on a PvP server.<br><br>Remember that you actually have to hit the other player first, and if you are on a PvP server you'll need more AB than this build can give.<br><br>*shrug*<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 10/26/05 20:46</span></i></p>

You are correct on the Halfling/Elf Dex bonus freeing up 2 stat boosts for Wis.  I should have seen that.  Good catch.<br><br>As you said, that would only add 1 to the DC.<br><br>If we shave off some Monk levels and replace with CoT for teh extra feats for Greater Wisdom, we also have to deduct those same levels for the Monk level bonus for the DC calculation.  I don't think the trade off will ever equal the payback.<br><br>I just don't see how 70 is possible.  You can only take 10 selections of Improved Stunning Fist, can't take 11 (according to the Grimoire).<br><br>Has anyone ever made a dc 70 on a regular legit server/module?
