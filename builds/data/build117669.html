These are the first two of my Final Tricks. The next two will be posted tomorrow.<br><br>First up: The Foe Hunter (no, not the PrC).<br><br>Ranger 25 / Fighter 8 / Weapon Master 7 : "The Foe Hunter"<br><br>STATS:<br><br>16 STR (+3) (your primary stat)<br>14 DEX (+2) (needed for spring attack/dodge)<br>10 CON (+1) (for health)<br>14 WIS (+2) (for will saves and spells)<br>14 INT (+2) (for skill points, expertise)<br>8 CHA (-1) (not needed in this build)<br><br>SKILLS: Tumble (cross-skill,) Discipline (ranger/fighter/wm,) Animal Empathy (ranger), Concentration (ranger/fighter/wm,) Intimidate (4 ranks only,) Spot (ranger/wm,) Hide/MS with remaining ranks.<br><br>EQUIPMENT: Full Plate/Hide Armor &amp; Longsword. You can dual-wield two longswords (with hide armor), or you can use a Longsword and a Shield. Alternate depending on the situation. When you need AC - use a shield; when you need more attacks and damage, use two swords. Alternatively, you can drop the versatility and just focus on greatsword.<br><br>ANIMAL COMPANION: Choose bear. It will end at level 25, and have quite a bit of HP. Though, because of low AC, he will mostly serve as cannon fodder for strong spells and newbies.<br><br>HP: 400 hp without any buffs/con increase items<br><br>STAT DISTRIBUTION: Raise nothing but Strength.<br><br>(1) Ranger 1 - Dodge, Mobility, Favored Enemy: Undead<br>(2) Ranger 1 / Fighter 1 - Weapon Focus: Longsword<br><br>(3) Ranger 1 / Fighter 2 - Knockdown, Expertise<br><br>(5) Ranger 1 / Fighter 4 - Weapon Spec: Longsword<br><br>(6) Ranger 1 / Fighter 5 - Spring Attack<br><br>(7) Ranger 1 / Fighter 6 - Whirlwind Attack<br><br>(9) Ranger 1 / Fighter 6 / Weapon Master 2 - Improved<br>Critical: Longsword<br><br>(12) Ranger 1 / Fighter 6 / Weapon Master 5 - Power Attack<br><br>(15) Ranger 2 / Fighter 6 / Weapon Master 7 - Cleave<br><br>(18) Ranger 5 / Fighter 6 / Weapon Master 7 - Great Cleave, Favored Enemy: Elf<br><br>(20) Ranger 7 / Fighter 6 / Weapon Master 7<br><br>**epic** (21 STR)<br><br>(21) Ranger 7 / Fighter 7 / Weapon Master 7 - Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword<br><br><br>(22) Ranger 7 / Fighter 8 / Weapon Master 7 - Epic Weapon Spec: Longsword<br><br>(24) Ranger 9 / Fighter 8 / Weapon Master 7 - Armor Skin<br><br>(25) Ranger 10 / Fighter 8 / Weapon Master 7 - Favored Enemy: Outsider<br><br>(27) Ranger 12 / Fighter 8 / Weapon Master 7 - Elemental Resist: Fire (10/-)<br><br>(30) Ranger 15 / Fighter 8 / Weapon Master 7 - Favored Enemy: Dragon, Overwhelming Critical: Longsword<br><br>(33) Ranger 18 / Fighter 8 / Weapon Master 7 - Epic Prowess<br><br>(35) Ranger 20 / Fighter 8 / Weapon Master 7 - Favored Enemy: Human<br><br>(36) Ranger 21 / Fighter 8 / Weapon Master 7 - Bane of Enemies<br><br>(38) Ranger 23 / Fighter 8 / Weapon Master 7 - Favored Enemy: Half-Orc<br><br>(39) Ranger 24 / Fighter 8 / Weapon Master 7 - Devastating Critical: Longsword<br><br>(40) Ranger 25 / Fighter 8 / Weapon Master 7 - Favored Enemy: Choose One.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 16:52</span></i></p>

Just for info... <br><br>Hitpoints: 400<br>Skillpoints: 271<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 22/18/21<br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 43 (melee), 33 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 18/28<br><br>Personally I feel this build could be improved on considerably. There are many other Ranger builds out there that are a better bet than this one.<br><br>One thing to note is the cripping penalty to dual wielding two longswords. The saves are low and there are no extra defences against spellcasters (eg. Spellcraft ranks). <br><br>I could go on, but there's no point really.

Lest us not forget that Lock is a premier builder.  This build, being 3 yrs old, was designed for a reason.  <br><br>Peace
