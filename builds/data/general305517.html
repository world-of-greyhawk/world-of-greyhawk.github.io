Caster level remains unchanged by PM levels.  In NWN, that's the way it is supposed to be.  In PnP, I believe things differ.<br><br>DC has nothing to do with caster or character level, so DC is unaffected by PM levels.  A DC is based off of the spell level, and your casting stat modifier.  Caster level has nothing to do with it.<br><br>Spell penetration is also based off of caster level, as is dispellability, for what it's worth.<br><br>Incidentally, there are 'fixes' that add PM to your caster level for duration, and such.  Some servers use them.  You could also add them to a mod yourself.  Personally, it seems to me that this is an awfully big power increase, and that from a class which does just fine, but to each his own.
