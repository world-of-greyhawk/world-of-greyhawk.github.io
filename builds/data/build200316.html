With the 'new' Implosion spell after 1.66, I figured it was time to pull out a melee character that can survive it, as well as almost any other spell that allows a save... and it's a Dwarf (Style, baby, style!).<br><br>Favored of Moradin<br><br><b>Playable from level 1, PvM</b><br><br>Born and bred in the underground halls of the Dwarves and raised with the ringing of the anvil in his ears, the Favored of Moradin is schooled in the arts of war and lucky enough to survive even in battles against spellslingers. Among his bag of tricks are the abilities and benefits of the Rogue as well as the specialized focus of the Fighter. As a champion of his deity, he enjoys the benefits of an uncommonly high ability to shrug off the effects of magical attacks. With a decent strength and extensive training in his favorite weapon, he can present a challenge to any melee opponent, and woe to those undisciplined enough to be knocked down. In that situation he also has the ability to inflict even more pain.<br><br><b>Advantages:</b> <br>Good STR and AB with mundane gear.<br>            Decent AC with maxed Tumble.<br>            Astounding saves for a meleer.<br>            5d6 sneak attack - in conjunction with Imp KD.<br>            Slippery Mind for a reroll on the 'weak' Will save (which is a whopping 43 vs spells, 37 base).<br>            Evasion to augment the 40 Reflex save (46 vs spells).<br>            UMD to provide versastility and a pseudo-magical ability.<br><br><b>Disadvantages:</b><br>Unable to self-buff, so reliant on gear/party members.<br>               Although STR is good, it's not uber, so gear is highly relevant to the build.<br>               HPs are decent, but pushing the lower to medium range for a melee character.<br><br>FTR 4/Rogue 10/CoT 26<br><br>Dwarf, any non-evil<br><br>STR 16 (30)<br>DEX 12<br>CON 16<br>INT 14<br>WIS 12<br>CHA 6<br><br>1 )Rogue1: Luck of Heroes<br>2 )FTR1: Weapon Focus<br>3 )Rogue2: Power Attack<br>4 )FTR2: Cleave/ STR (17)<br>5 )FTR3<br>6 )FTR4: Iron Will/ Weapon Specialization<br>7 )Rogue3<br>8 )Rogue4: STR (18)<br>9 )CoT1: Knockdown<br>10)CoT2: Blind Fight<br>11)CoT3<br>12)Rogue5: Lightning Reflexes/ STR (19)<br>13)CoT4: Imp Crit<br>14)CoT5<br>15)CoT6: Grt Fortitude/ Imp Knockdown<br>16)CoT7: STR (20)<br>17)Rogue6<br>18)CoT8: Toughness/ Great Cleave<br>19)CoT9<br>20)CoT10: Expertise/ STR (21)<br><br>21)CoT11: Epic Weapon Focus<br>22)Rogue7<br>23)CoT12 <br>24)CoT13: Epic Will/ STR (22)<br>25)CoT14: Epic Weapon Specialization<br>26)CoT15<br>27)Rogue8: GRT STR I (23)<br>28)CoT16: STR (24)<br>29)CoT17<br>30)CoT18: GRT STR II (25)/ Epic Prowess <br>31)CoT19<br>32)Rogue9: STR (26) <br>33)CoT20: GRT STR III (27)<br>34)CoT21<br>35)CoT22: Armor Skin<br>36)CoT23: GRT STR IV (28)/ STR (29)<br>37)Rogue10: Slippery Mind<br>38)CoT24<br>39)CoT25: Epic Fortitude<br>40)CoT26: Epic Toughness I/ STR (30)<br><br>AB: +42/+37/+32/+27<br><br>HPs: 440 (no rerolls), 530 max<br><br>Naked AC: 21<br><br>Saves (CoT Bonus)[vs. spells]:<br><br>Fort: 33 (46)[52]<br>Refl: 27 (40)[46]<br>Will: 24 (37)[43]<br><br>Skill Points: 250<br><br>Tumble: 40<br>Discipline: 43<br>Spellcraft: 18<br>Concentration: 21<br>Spot: 43<br>UMD: 37<br><br>18 left over.<br><br>In an environment with no immunity items and autofail on 1 turned off (as it should be), this guy would be a real pain in the backside for casters, since his saves are so high and can't be dispelled.

I was actually going to mention being that close to the cap as an advantage, since you don't have to use your item slots for save booster. You could fill those with something else. All you'd have to worry about is getting the Will up a bit (that's why I took Slippery Mind though. The Will save's high, so 2 shots at every Will save should be sufficient).<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;This is still a good build and a fair survivor against spells, but it might have some trouble with melee combat.

I like this build for a variety of reasons.<br><br>1.  He still has a very decent AB, and is probably more noticeable in pre-epic.  He still packs a punch and still gets a decent AC.<br><br>2.

You definately blew my defending champ's saves ut of the water with his at 37 fortitude, 25 Reflex and 27 Will naked, and another 6 to each with maxed out CHA items.
