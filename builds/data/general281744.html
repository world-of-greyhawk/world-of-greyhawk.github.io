Hi,<br><br>Could someone confirm if Improved Stunning Fist(ISF) feat selection is broken?<br><br>I am trying a build where it qualified for ISF at level 21.<br>At level 21, all classes can select ISF.<br>After that even on the normal feat levels only monk or fighter can select it.<br>AFAIK this should be the case for the bonus feats but not the normal feat selection.<br><br>Also Kamiryn's CBC doesn't allow it to be selected at all for non monk/fighter classes.<br><br>Thanks if you can confirm either way.

What happens is that if you met the pre-requisites via taking Monk levels, only Monk can take them... I've only tried with CoT's bonus feats and Monk's...<br><br>However, if you took Improved Unarmed Attack feat and Stunning Fist without Monk levels you should be able to take ISF without monk... I've never really tried to do so, I'm not completely sure.<br><br>Why do you want ISF on a non-monk build? it's a lot easier to be a shifter monk for stunning fists.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Yes, I haven't used any monk levels.<br><br>Weird that it works correctly for the first ISF feat but not after that.<br><br>Was working on a variation of grizzled_dwarflord's Shadowboxer build. <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "221720", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Have recently seen mentioned the use of druid or shifter which looks good and will probably try next.
