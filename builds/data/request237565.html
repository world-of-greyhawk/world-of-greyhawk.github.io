As the name implies, I am now looking for an Assasin-Type Character, for PVP.<br><br>I may ask for a level 40 build later, but currently, I require one fitting a level 30 cap. The server is low magic, count on nothing higher than +2 Weapons or Armour, Haste is ~NOT~ on any item, there are no item-granted immunities to anything, and oh no...Shadowdancer is dissalowed!! <br><br>It is also relitively difficult to level up on this server so playability may be an option, but I have alot of fortitude when it comes to putting up with **** characters if the end result is worth it.<br><br>My two concerns are AB and AC. I am failry incompetent when it comes to this stuff so I dont know how to get an AB over 30-35, and that may be an issue, so if anyone can give me an assasin build with decent AB, that would be good. Also, due to the very same incompetence, I dont know how to get a good AC either, the highest I have gotten is around 35-40 but I would like something higher.<br><br>I am willing to be any race, though half-elf and human are my favourite for RP reasons...though a full elf is alright as well. No midgets! <br><br>So to recap everything: Low magic items, nothing beyond +2 and with no item-granted immunities. No Shadowdancer or HiPS. No midget races. 30 Levels. I like decent AB and good AC. No haste from items, except for which I need UMD. The builds playability is not necisary.

Okay, just checking: what do you think is decent AB/AC for a level 30 character? Note, <b>unbuffed</b>.<br>_________________<br>"And one calculates <i>time</i> from the <i>dies nefastus</i> on which this fatality arose – from the <i>first</i> day of Christianity! – <i>Why not rather from its last?</i> – <i>From today?</i> – Revaluation of all values!"

In such a low magic server, dexers may have it rough, considering that any spellcaster can blast them out of the water.  While this is always true, it tends to be even more pronounced when pressented in these harsh environments.  My thought is that you may do better with a strength-based approach and compensate your stealth skills with feats instead of Dex.  <br><br>Nevertheless, here is a dex-based approach that actually takes a strength approach to make him tough as nails in the early part of his career, and yet still allows for operational flexibility.  He gradually morphs into a true dexer, and his 16str and WS/EWS allow for solid hitting power.  He is nearly pure Assassin (only one level removed), and his DA DC is about as high as it can be without cannibalizing stats.  <br><br>However, he has little defenses against the arcane and divine(other than Evasion).  You should get enough skill points to crossclass Spellcraft, which I highly suggest.  Anything Will-based is anathema.

What about saves and AC?<br><br>Oh, and I was wondering if anyone had any assasin types that implement bards, as I find it rather interesting RP. Plus, the curse song could come in good handy as well as buffing my weapon to surpass mage defences (Though I dont know how hard it is to make such a build decently with only 30 levels.)<br><br>Thanks for any advice you guys can give me.

Alright...I have condensed all of my thinking for the day, into a good 7 minutes creating a build. It is rough. It likely sucks. I dont know really.<br><br>Bard 15/Assasin 15 (Steps: Bard 14/Assasin 15/Bard 1)<br><br>I am ~so~ not going to list all the feats and the order they come in (unless this build actually turns out farely good, then I will post all of it) but I will give the end result of this level 30 build:<br><br>Str: 12<br>Dex: 15 (24)<br>Con: 12<br>Int: 14<br>Wis: 8<br>Cha: 15<br><br>Fort: 12<br>Will: 15<br>Ref: 26 (Evasion?

Well, there's little point in taking Assassin levels if you are going Bard heavy.  You might as well take the Rogue levels and double your skill points and get Evasion and Crippling Strike.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Is a Shifter's Kobol Commando's HIPS allowed on the server?<br><br>Personally... I think a Druid Assasin mix would be interesting.<br><br>Pump Druid up until you get Improved Elemental Form and become an Earth Elemental Assasin.<br><br>IKD would be good for this build.<br><br>You'd have good DR, and immunities.  Size advantage for KD.  Fun build to RP along the way.<br><br>Might add a level of Monk for some Wisdom AC.<br><br>You won't need to pump up Str or Dex, you can put 20 into Wis and have the rest for Int.<br><br>Start with more Int than Wis during level up for extra skill points.<br><br>If you are interested in this concept, I can build up a lvl 30 for you.<br><br>During level up you could use your Druid spells or go for Animal Form hunting.  Keeping the Earth Elemetal Assasin as your target form.<br><br><br>(personally... I think a Druid/Shifter/Assasin would be best.  You'd get +5 Weapons with your epic forms and lots of Good DR.)

...<br><br>Yes, I read it...<br><br>It doesnt answer my question though. He says 31 is pretty good but does it have to be that high? Should it be higher? I dont know these things and I dont know how many assasin levels it takes to have such a high DC.

Meh...I guess I'll read up on assasins for the greater details, but I would still like to know what a good DC is for a low-magic, level 30 server. Its a fort save I guess, so what is the average Fort of a decent character? It would make most sense to try and revolve my DC around what my targets might have.<br><br>And I am still waiting to hear a Bardic Assasin type if anyone has one...much apreciated.

Death Attack DC = 10 + Assassin level + Int mod<br><br>Fort save of a level 30 fighter: 17 + Con mod + feats + items<br><br>Note that it could be higher if he multiclasses pre-epic with another class with high Fort saves. I would expect a typical fighter type to have a Fort save at least in the low- to mid- 20's, higher if they have CoT levels or went for high Con. If they pick save-boosting items and wear boots of Striding, it could reach 30+.<br><br>Rogues and spellcasters will be considerably lower, of course.<br><br>So if you want your Death Attack to be effective on fighter types, you want to max it out and boost Int as much as possible with items.<br><br>TM

I dont know the server you play on, but when a builder goes out of his way to limit the enchantments to +2, they usually dont make the mistake of leaving gmw as it is!  I have seen  gmw "tweaked" to make it a realative pain in the arse!  So just because you used a leveler and got bard to 15 to get +5, it would be a serious error to build your character around this.  If I'm right (and I have no way of knowing for sure), the builder of your server would more than likely either limit the +for divine damage and gmw to 2, OR like some servers, you get +1/6 lvls of caster class, so a lv 30 bard would give +5!   Its a balance thing, which sounds alot like what your server is about.  Check it out before you start the bard/assy, then take grizz's advice since he gave you exactly what you asked for.<br><br>Peace
