Basicly I'd like awar machine and it has to be a half orc.<br><br>Im playing on cormyr in a RP world and the max magic item would be around +5 and basicly what a cleric can buff. It should be self reliant, but without buffs. Barbarian is a must for TF.rage. The AB should be just under 50 before using rage.<br>_________________<br>Valkos clueless

Actually I've been looking on the barb/ftr/wm combo and it looks like it is something like just that I'm looking for.<br><br>16 grants terrifying rage. 7 wm lvls and ftr at least 4. so it could peak at lvl 27 with all the abilities I need.<br><br>Question now is do I need more barb or WM? Seems rather costly to take more WM, but I would like some ideas<br>_________________<br>Valkos clueless

I looked at your Master of wild axe <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "218241", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> <br>and it was really good. I used it as half orc, but it loses alot more than it gains. I lose the racials of dwarf, int decrease hurts, it does -1ab/dmg when you are a half orc.. A DWARF OUTDOING AN ORC WHEN IT COMES TO STR?! It is pretty aweful. So I'm thinking of doing something a little different, which perhaps will make the half orc more viable. Going 18 str and 12 con and then going 29 barb lvls 7 wm 4 ftr.<br>I know that DR is very good, but I think it hurts a H.orc. Perhaps a dwarf would be better :S<br>_________________<br>Valkos clueless

Have you checked the build just above your last post? It has no EDR at it gets +4 AB/dmg compared to my dwarven Barb/WM. WM 7 will mean a much lower AB by the way. You'll lose 2 epic feats by going Barb 29 vs WM 19 btw.<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!

I was thinking of doing a remake of a old orc build I had on eternalwar. It was 20 paladin and at lvl 20 it had the highest AB and just up there with WM in terms of dmg. They could only tear me down by crits =P<br>_________________<br>Valkos clueless
