After having played with this character halfway through the Aielund Saga, I have noticed that the "turning point" for him is at level 9, when you get Improved Critical. Before that you just won't kill thinks fast enough and due to the fact that you won't be wearing shields, you will get hit often.<br><br>Having made the proper alterations and greatly increased the AB, I have found myself missing combat feats to disable my opponents. I think that it could be a good idea to exchange 2 Great Charisma feats for KD and IKD. That way, the Charisma will end at 22 instead of 24, but you will have more options than just attacking in combat.<br><br>Also, I have created an alternate version of this build with more STR for those who feel that taking KD/IKD would not be worth it because of the low STR modifier. I haven't had much time lately, but there was a holiday on tuesday and it was raining heavily the entire day, so I managed to work a little on my builds then. I'll post it now <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  .<br><br>Take it EZ!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Maximillian Kane on 01/22/09 20:58</span></i></p>

Since this is a PvM build, that is to be played up from 1-40, I don't really see great value to that Monk level in the very end.

Other classes can do that too. Rogue seem to me a better choice, since it also gives UMD and 1d6 sneak attack. OR cross class skills and take SD. That is, if you want that 1 cheese level at the end, although I find it.... pointless. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

I will explain to you my reasons for doing this the way it was described, whether they are or not right, that will be for you to judge. 20 Paladin levels for the much needed spell slots (I know you're not disputing that point <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ). 19 WM levels for the +3 AB / bonus feats. Those are the "must haves" in this build so that it maintains its concept. That leaves me with ONLY ONE extra level. <br><br>The way I see it, no class would give me more than the Monk in that last little "unimportant" level: 40 Tumble, Evasion, Cleave. Even the 2 Fighter (and I only have 1 available) you suggested won't give me as much, since I'd sacrifice 2 very good feats (Cleave and Evasion) for +1 STR modifier (2 Great Strengths). That is just the way I see it. I know it sucks to have to wait that long for that little Monk level (which could be anticipated to 37th if you wish to get the CHEESE sooner), but I've played it and it has been effective so far.<br><br>By all means I'm not "defending" this build, just pointing out the reasons for doing it this way. Actually, now that I think of it, it may be worth to sacrifice 3 Listen (the reason why I took Monk at 40 instead of 37) for earlier Cleave and Evasion. So there you go. 37th level CHEESE it is! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br><br>Take it EZ!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Maximillian Kane on 01/23/09 02:57</span></i></p>

I agree that one less pally level won't make that much of a difference spellwise, but to me what makes Monk the right choice is the fact that you get BOTH Cleave and Evasion with just one level. The good damage buffs are short-term ones (Divine Might + Divine Favor), so one extra attack while buffed can be more devastating than 1d6 Sneak Attack for a guy who has no Hide, Move Silently or Invisibility of any kind. More skill points are good, but not worth my while in the end.<br><br>Take it EZ!

You could though, drop WM to 16, adding 4 fighter(2-3 pre-epic) getting the same amount of epic feats(3), same AB, 1 more damage, same Pally slots. And the benefits I told in my last post. All at the cost of a level you probably won't even play. In any case, the slots from Pal20 is of less worth than opening up some good feats pre-epic.<br><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 01/23/09 02:54 (GMT) -- Maximillian Kane<br>The way I see it, no class would give me more than the Monk in that last little "unimportant" level: 40 Tumble, Evasion, Cleave. Even the 2 Fighter (and I only have 1 available) you suggested won't give me as much, since I'd sacrifice 2 very good feats (Cleave and Evasion) for +1 STR modifier (2 Great Strengths). That is just the way I see it. I know it sucks to have to wait that long for that little Monk level (which could be anticipated to 37th if you wish to get the CHEESE sooner), but I've played it and it has been effective so far.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Getting cleave at lvl 40 is just as valuable as never getting it, so I do not agrre to this point. Also, if you really mean those feats are so useful to the build that it trumps the fighter levels, then at least take it so it can be enjoyed. At lvl 22 f.ex.. You'll have 3 AC less at lvl 40, but 5 more from 22-&gt;39. That's a good stretch. That goes for the other Monk feats as well. And read my last reply again, 2 fighter does way more than "+1 STR modifier".<br><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 01/23/09 02:54 (GMT) -- Maximillian Kane<br>By all means I'm not "defending" this build, just pointing out the reasons for doing it this way.

@ Grim<br><br>I understand and agree with you in everything that you said. It will be more playable in both cases, if I add Fighter 4 or if I sacrifice 1 Pally for Rogue 2. <br><br>In the first alternative, I'd lose Cleave and get UMD and earlier Tumble drops, plus 1d6 Sneak Attack and more final Skillpoints.<br><br>In the second one, however, if I go Fighter, why not just go CoT instead? I get Save bonuses and bonus feats as well! OH If I did go Fighter I'd get WS and EWS, right?

I can't help but think in terms of level 40 power. So as much as I agree with everything you said (and I really do), to me it is sufficient to know that IF I had been able to level it up all the way to 40, I'd get that result. I can perfectly see your point and it is taken. It's good that you posted your suggestions so that other people that aren't as mentally ill as I am <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  can incorporate them into this build if they decide to play it.<br><br>As for me, if I run into an impassable barrier (something that this build can't kill this way), I will go for your suggestions.<br><br>I think of it as creating a build and "hanging" it in a wall like a college degree.

I've always seen paladin wms as difficult builds to make. Too many feats and too many stats to compromise with. I'd rather go for a low charisma paladin (yes those exist aswell you know) and pump str and maybe some con to increase survival odds abit.

I understand why the charisma boost is there tho, saves are low for a build like this but that can also be fixed with feats (think epic reflex, epic will for example).<br><br>Compromising between charisma and strength on a twohanded juggernaut is just not right IMO.<br><br>/arvut

I don't remember the name of the build, but the Dwarflord came up with a really nice pally/WM that capitolized on taunt, WM artifical weapon of choice AB and divine feats.

I found out that Taunt is EXTREMELLY USEFUL. I dropped Heal (20) and Persuade (20), and reduced Concentration from 43 to 40 for Taunt (43) . <br><br>I have taken a few conclusions that apply at least to the environment I play in:<br><br>1- This guy really needs AC, so not having a shield makes it 10 times more difficult to play with him.

Heal and Persuade aren't really missed. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   <br><br>Anyway, that's pretty much it. I find that there's way too much synergy between Pally and WM (Increased multiplier and Ki Critical with Divine Might, Divine Favor, Bull's Strength and Taunt) to make this build very solid overall. Monk only adds to the cheese and compensates for the severe lack of feats / skill points that it suffers from.

I have been authorized by Grim to post this addendum. I have grown as a builder in the last couple of years, and also have had a lot of chances to play with this build. The only bad thing about it is the feat starvation, but the synergy between Paladin damage buffs and the Weapon Master critical hit improvements is just amazing. Now after having played on a very hard PW and 2 different campaigns with it, I would like to share the few adjustments I made to make it even more effective.<br><br>1- A 2-handed weapon is indeed a waste, STR is too low. A Weapon / Shield give you much needed early AC and playability, plus you have SO MANY damage buffs that the 1.5x STR is irrelevant. The shield (especially a magic one) is much more useful.<br><br>2- I thought initially that the best suited weapon for this build was either a rapier or scimitar, but on the PW I played there were no good ones, so I switched to a Battleaxe. Now, at first I thought it was harder, because I was critting a lot less, but as I levelled up, I was missing on 10s, 11s, 12s, 13s unbuffed, which made the extra threat range kind of redundant, and since most of your good buffs are short duration ones, you really gotta enjoy them while you can. The AB was high enough, but like I said, the PW was hard (Rogue players were always complaining that they couldn't hit anything). Anyway, that change was a blessing in disguise, because from the moment this build reaches lvl 20 up until lvl 27, it just flourishes rapidly from a mediocre build to a wrecking machine. At lvl 20 you get the increased multiplier, at 21 you get Divine Might, at 23 Ki Critical, at 24 Extra Smiting and at 27 Divine Shield. Then all the waiting then starts to make sense. <br><br>2- You could relinquish a couple of spells for even more playability, making it Pal 19 / Monk 2 / WM 19. I, however, have not felt the need to do that, even on the PW I was playing. The end result will be a bit worse, but it'll be a lot more playable. If you choose to do this, I suggest taking that Monk lvl after 27, because all the feats you get from 20-27 are more important than that Monk Cheese. Cleave is nice to have, but taking monk at 22 would mean delaying WM 7 for 2 lvls, and Ki Critical is more important. The earliest you may take it is at 25, but then you'll still get the same Tumble score than at 22. Your call <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>3- Just taking a little moment here to discribe the potential:<br><br>- Damage output with a Keen Battleaxe (where I play, you can get one) and Capped CHA(also attainable with merely a Nymph's Cloak +6): 1-8 +4 (15-20/x4)<br><br>+3 from Deafening Clang<br>+13 from Divine Might<br>+5 from Divine Favor<br>+1 from Bless<br>+1 from Aid<br>+1 from Prayer<br>+5 from Holy Sword (or GMW)<br>+1 or 2 from Bull's Strength<br><br>That add up to 34-35 bonus damage, plus your STR-enhancing gear. You'll crit over 120 EVERY SINGLE TIME while buffed.<br><br>Furthermore, you have the following enhancements that only work against Evil monsters:<br><br>+20 from Smite Evil (or 19 if you go for that 2nd Monk lvl)<br>+2d6 from Holy Sword<br><br>Your total MAX BONUS DAMAGE on a successful critical hit against an evil monster is a whopping 102. That makes you average 350 on a Critical hit with a Smite. Oh those evil bosses better watch out!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> <br><br>Your criticals will HURT! Your smites, WOW! Crit immune monsters are a pain, but not so much that you can't handle them. Also, since you can kill many things very quickly, I chose to drop KD and IKD for 2 Great Charismas.<br><br>Anyway, here's the final product. Hope you like it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">
