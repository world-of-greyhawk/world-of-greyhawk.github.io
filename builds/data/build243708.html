Interesting class selection.  I like the Quarterstaff focus as well, even though there isn't anything but the appearance that makes it stand out as a weapon. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>A few questions.  Can you really hit anything with this guy after buffing?  I'm skeptical.  If at all possible, could you lay out just how you would buff this character (including what bonuses you receive from each buff) to make him an effective melee fighter.<br><br>Do you absolutely need Improved Combat Casting?  What spells would you be casting in the midst of combat that would necessitate this?  Your wizard spells shouldn't be overly powerful, as far as I can tell.  I see that this is a Pale Master feat, but would it not be possible to drop both ICC and CC and take another feat such as Power Attack pre-epic?  You could then take Combat Casting, if nothing else, in place of ICC (maybe extend spell/still spell???).  What about trying to fit in Still Spell/Automatic Still Spell so you can wear heavy armor?<br><br>Why do you raise your INT to 19?  This doesn't make sense to me as having an odd ability score gives you no benefit.  Why not drop your STR at creation to 16, then raise your CON to 12.  This will help with your HP problem and solve the issue of where to put that extra ability point boost (namely into STR). <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    I don't believe it will conflict with the level at which you chose to take Dev Crit.<br><br>Hrm, well, that's all for now.  Most likely I'm just not seeing your motivation behind a number of these things.<br><br>Edit: Okay, so I forgot about Truestrike (which I leaned heavily on to justify my Wiz/PM/Assassin) which would help out with your AB and maybe need ICC.  Heh, your AB is still 2 lower than the Gravewalker Assassin. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "217926", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Ythaniel on 06/13/06 04:21</span></i></p>

Maybe effective is the wrong word, more just hoping for a critical hit.<br> <br>Short period buffs:<br>Haste + Bull Strength + Blackstaff + True Strike + Flame Weapon<br>Standard QuarterStaff <br>59/59/54/49<br>(1-6)+15 17-20/x3 <br>+4 Bludgeoning 1d4+3 Fire<br><br>Longer period buffs:<br>Bull Strength + Magic Weapon + Flame Weapon<br>Standard QuarterStaff <br>36/31/26 <br>(1-6)+15 17-20/x3 <br>+1 Bludgeoning 1d4+3 Fire<br> <br>Don't need ICC as such just a choice amongst limited options of PM Epic bonus feats.  <br>Mainly used if I do need to recast buffs or summons during battle. <br>Tried to fit in Automatic Still Spell but doesn't qualify for prereq. ability to cast 9th level spells.  <br><br>I don't like odd abilities either normally but wanted Int 19 for 9th level Wizard spells. <br>Wanted that to be a part of the build rather than boosting Int from an item later.<br><br>If you do take INT to only 18 then yes can start STR 16 &amp; CON 12 but would delay Dev Crit a couple of levels.

Your AB kinda ... doesn't work. At all. Even most buffs won't last, given that you have a caster level of 3. 3 rounds is not enough for a spell like haste.<br><br>This also means that your PM touch attacks probably won't hit any dexterity based character, and most strength based they hit will have high enough saves to resist them.<br><br>In addition - you can't reliably cast even spells without a save because they're weak due to low caster level.<br><br>I'm not sure how much WM gives you here. You're giving out five feats on a build that gets nothing but PM bonus feats.<br><br>I would either change it to Wizard 21/PM 16/Bard 3 if you wanted more of a spellcasting presence, or PM 16/Wizard 11/Fighter 13 for more of a melee presence. Either way, you more than make up for lost armor bonus with the fact that you can use an armor and shield, and get more presence as a spellcaster, and keep Epic Warding.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

Ythaniel, Yeah, not the first but I think mine is sufficiently different if not better. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>I like the v2 of your Grave Walker Assasin, maybe I should sacrifice some of the spellcasting ability for a stonger melee presence.<br><br>avarielo, yes the level 3 limitiation is challenging.<br>But there are even offensive spells that can be useful such as Bigby's interposing hand and Isaac's greater missile storm.<br><br>For the touch attacks I wanted to max the DC for the fortitude save which is purely based on PM levels wheras the AB can be increased other ways.<br><br>WM is mainly to increase critical range for Dev. and Overwh. criticals.

I'd definitely drop starting STR to 16, boost CON to 12. Then change the level spread to 10/8/22 (you thus get more BAB with 4/8/8 pre-epic). You can then choose Great INT on your Wiz bonus feats to save points to STR. You'll still be able to get Dev Crit at level 36.<br>_________________<br>"...<br>C'est un pays plus nu que la terre polaire<br>— Ni bêtes, ni ruisseaux, ni verdure, ni bois!<br><br>Or il n'est pas d'horreur au monde qui surpasse<br>La froide cruauté de ce soleil de glace<br>Et cette immense nuit semblable au vieux Chaos;<br>..."

Interesting, tried that it and it is a much more even spread of classes.  Was able to get AB 36/31/26 with quarterstaff, 320 HP and better spellcasting. Only disadvantage is lower AC, less epic spells and other PM abilities.<br><br>Also tweaked original build so that started with STR 16 &amp; INT 17 to get a few extra skill points. And took Epic Weapon Focus instead of Great STR at lvl 39 to increase AB to 34/29/24.

Still an issue, but not nearly as important. The PM abilities other than AC and immunities aren't that important - and dropping Dragon Knight and Mummy Dust (especially Mummy Dust) isn't going to hurt your potential much.<br>_________________<br>CATS!
