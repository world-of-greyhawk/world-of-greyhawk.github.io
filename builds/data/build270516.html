<i>Robbing from the Rich and Feeding the Poor PvM (1-40) and PvP</i><br><br><b>GREEN KNIGHT (the “Wildwood Minstrel”)</b><br><b>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar</b><br><br>This character is a concept/RP build, but a fun one (and me thinks an effective one, too), being inspired by the legendary Robin Hood and his merry band of men: among these merry men was counted “Alan O’ Dale,” a minstrel, who in between fighting kept himself entertained and busy, in the forest, by entertaining Robin himself and all of the other merry men. <br><br>The Series:<br>In keeping with the above theme and legends, this build –which is the first of its kind in terms of the class combo (and the second of a two-part series), revolves around the Ranger Class, and use of the double-bladed weapon (i.e., two-bladed sword), with WM (for superior weapon focus (and bane alone making more WM levels unnecessary) since, and more importantly, the prime reason of WM here is to expand the crit range, which it does very nicely), thus impressive damage. <br><br>(To see the other character, entitled: Robin Hood, “the Wildwood Warrior” (Ftr 8/WM 22/Ranger 10):  <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "270518", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> (being a variation on this theme, with links therein also to the 3 other ranger/wm builds which, although very different from both this Minstrel and his companion, are similar (in spirit) to this one).<br><br>This Build:<br>In keeping within the legends of such an unlikely band of heroes, this build asks thusly: what do you get when you mix high ranger with just enough weapon master, and toss in a touch of bard for skills? A solid, strength based, double-bladed ranger, with pretty good stealth, magic access, and also very good (high buffed) AB, who deals impressive damage (thanks to WM’s expanded crit. range). While more levels of WM would be nice, it is unnecessary in light of ranger’s bane, adding not only AB, but also damage (which multiplies very nicely on a crit too). With full UMD access also not only to further enhance damage but, together with epic ranger buffs, bolster what otherwise are problematic saves, this combo makes for a solid stealth-based/damage dealing meelee’r.

This is a nice build. I have one big beef with it. You do the only thing I dislike more than taking WM7, and that's taking WM13. The first 7 lvls are expensive, but in some cases viable. Taking 6 more to only get 1AB is clearly not worth it. Theme aside. 4 more Ranger levels grant you two more feats, one of them EWF. That also increases the FE bonuses by one. And leaves you with two more Bard for more even skilldrops.<br><br>Ranger/WMs suffer from feat-starvation of course. Decent build though, and cool to read what I call a semi-story again. Hope my advice helps.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Thanks, Grim – appreciate your compliment and your suggestions (as usual, they be really good ones <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    <br><br>Yeah, so true: re feats, but worth it me thinks, too (thanks!) And while I never like seeing the loss of a single hard AB, you’re right: on this build, we can live with the loss of one; after all, the reason for WM here is to generate crits (in which case, 7 will do, ‘tis true); so, by taking on more bard and ranger instead, yes, we'd lose 1 AB and one wm bonus feat (i.e., ewf), but get 2 ranger bonus feats (and thus, ewf right back) along with (i'm thinking) either epic toughness, so more HPs -or- a bit of rearranging for either more AC or IKD; also, +12 skills (no such thing as too many, 'tis true), a better bard whisper, and a +1 bonus on damage and taunt vs. FEs (i.e., +7 FEs, which multiplies, too). And more bard (for spreading skill dumps), hence enhanced playability – YAHH! <br><br>That does sound good (thanks, Grim!); alright, gonna run it up proper and will repost a revision soon - so, stay tuned folks ~ Tyr <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 04/09/07 19:44</span></i></p>

Actually, since he is supposed to be the minstrel of the group, I would go heavier on Bard and perhaps drop WM altogether. Ranger 23/Bard 17 would let you get the max Bard Song, cast all Bard spells, and have a lot more skill points. Your effective AB with Song/Curse Song would be quite a bit higher than the WM version (+2 from Song, -5 to enemy AC from Curse Song, vs. +2 from 13 WM levels). You lose the extra crit range, but you'll have an easier time confirming the crit threats you roll. <br><br>Plus, he'll sing a lot better - would Robin really settle for a amateur level 1 bard? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 04/09/07 20:28</span></i></p>

Agreed. This misses the RP mark which was, I thought, the aim. I would hardly call him Allan A'Dale, Minstrel, or anything else with only 1 Bard level.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Yeah, alright: you guys both be right (and thanks); was keeping within the "spirit" but heh, Robin def. wouldn't have an amateur, that's for sure <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">       <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">      <br><br>With that, let's redub this one The Wildwood Mercenary, in the memory of Will Scarlett (he's the one who, after avenging his wife's (or was it his father's) death, by hunting down and executing the murderers, met up with Robin in the woods and (as one of the tales go), went on to help Robin and Tuck free a princess who was being held captive by "giants" in the east; an alleged noble-turned mercenary, Will was said to enjoy fancy clothes, carry a rose, and at times even be musical -- yeah, Ranger/WM/Bard works perfectly for him, doesn't it? (and will redub him proper on repost; thanks, guys - really appreciate your comments! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      <br><br>In the meantime, picking up on TM's suggestions and, together, we be making the guild a high Ranger/mid-bard to take the proper place of Alan, the Wildwood Minstrel -obviously a different focus than is this build, and almost ready for posting (as is this one, redubbed for Scarlett, as revised in accordance with Grimmer's awesome suggestions), ... so, stay tuned folks (thanks to TM and Dwarflord, we have us not only a Robin and an Alan coming up proper, but also a Scarlett now, too ...
