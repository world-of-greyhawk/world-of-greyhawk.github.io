<i>“They were an order from the days of old, when sorcerers were war generals, and led the charge upon the field, and each was equivalent to a company of hardened myrmidons and a battery of ballistae.  I have read the annals where they called down the Rain of Colourless Fire, the Invoked Devastation, in which the lands were inundated by a nearly invisible fiery rain which killed all creatures it struck, burned all living things, ignited the landscape with colorless flame, and burned the very hills into ash.  Would that I had just dozen of such men, and Oerth would know once again the strength of the Suel, and the Free City of Greyhawk would swim in a river of its own blood.”</i>  <br> <b><i>---Lord Malachar to the Scarlet Brotherhood’s War Council on the eve of war, 582 CY</i></b><br><br><b> The August Spell-Blade</b><br>Class:  Sorcerer 26 / Fighter 6 / CoT 8<br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Non-Evil<br>Playable: 1-40, PvM<br><br><b>Attributes</b><br>Str16 (26)<br>Int12<br>Wis8<br>Dex8<br>Con14<br>Chr16(20)<br><br><b>Level Guide</b><br>1 Sorcerer1, Extend Spell, Skill Focus: Concentration<br>2 Sorcerer2<br>3 Sorcerer3, Spell Penetration<br>4 Sorcerer4, Str17<br>5 Sorcerer5<br>6 Sorcerer6, Empower Spell<br>7 Sorcerer7<br>8 Sorcerer8, Str18<br>9 Fighter1, Exotic Weaponry, Blindfighting<br>10 Fighter2, WF: Bastard Sword<br>11 Fighter3<br>12 Fighter4, WS: Bastard Sword, Still Spell, Str19<br>13 Sorcerer9<br>14 CoT1<br>15 Sorcerer10, Greater Spell Penetration<br>16 CoT2, Improved Crit: Bastard Sword, Str20<br>17 CoT3<br>18 CoT4, Toughness, Knockdown<br>19 CoT5<br>20 Fighter5, Chr17<br>21 Sorcerer11, Great Chr I<br>22 Sorcerer12<br>23 Sorcerer13<br>24 Sorcerer14, EWF: Bastard Sword, Chr19<br>25 Sorcerer15<br>26 Sorcerer16<br>27 Sorcerer17, Great Str I<br>28 Sorcerer18, Str22<br>29 CoT6, Autostill I<br>30 Fighter6, EWS: Bastard Sword, Autostill II<br>31 Sorcerer19<br>32 Sorcerer20, Str23<br>33 Sorcerer21, Epic Warding<br>34 Sorcerer22<br>35 Sorcerer23, Autostill III<br>36 Sorcerer24, Great Str II, Str25<br>37 Sorcerer25<br>38 Sorcerer26, Great Chr II<br>39 CoT7, Epic Prowess<br>40 CoT8, Armor Skin, Str26<br><br><b>Combat Vitals</b><br>AB: 37/32/27 (mundane blade)<br>Damage: 1d10+14 (17-20/x2)<br>AC: 27 (Plate &amp; Shield)<br>HP: 364<br><br><b>Saves</b><br>Fort: 27 (35)<br>Will: 22 (31)<br>Reflex: 21 (29)<br><br><b>Skills</b> 172<br>Concentration: 43 (48 )<br>Discipline: 43 (51)<br>Spellcraft: 39 (40)<br>Tumble: 20<br>Persuade: 1 (6)<br>Search: 2(3)<br>Heal: 2<br><br><b>Spells:</b><br>1st: True Strike, Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Endure Elements, Identify<br>2nd: Bulls Strength, Flame Weapon, Eagles Splendour, Cats Grace, Endurance<br>3rd: Keen Edge, Haste, Greater Magic Weapon, Flame Arrow<br>4th: Ice Storm, Improved Invis, Lesser Ikes, Stoneskin<br>5th: Lesser Spell Mantle, Lesser Mind Blank, Mestils, Energy Buffer*<br>6th: Ikes Yikes, True Seeing, Greater Stoneskin<br>7th: Shadowshield, Spell Mantle, Bigbys*<br>8th: Greater Sanctuary, Premonition, Summon VIII*<br>9th: Time Stop, Mordenkainen’s Disjunction, Summon IX*<br>Epic: Epic Warding**<br><br>* <i>Indicate those spells that suit this type of build and playstyle.

One can easily drop a couple of Epic Feats for Greater Ruin and Epic Mage Armor.</i><br><br><b>Summary</b> <br>First, he is one of a kind.  No builds with this combination exist in the Guild.  While he is not a powerhouse sorcerer, he’s versatile enough to hold his own.  The goal of this character was to be both a formidable combatant, and then to gain the edge in all contests with Sorcerer buffs, and then to be able to finish the job with Sorcerer firepower.  He gains enough combat feats and metamagic feats to be proficient in both.  <br><br>Second, the template is very flexible in pre-epic or epic; one could do it any number of ways.  There are enough feats to be had in both careers to grab Dev Crit, or to garner more Epic Spells.  I kept it pretty simple with the above.  He never really stops maturing, and keeps getting stronger and stronger with every level.  He gets EWF/EWS, Timestop, Mords, and can blast Ikes Yikes in full armor all by level 30.  He’s strong enough to deal with the Mobs, has plenty of Arcane defenses, and has the firepower to blow up bosses.  He has the spell penetration of a 30th level caster, and eventually becomes undispellable.   <br><br>While he can’t raise his AB in the way a Cleric can, his unbuffed AB is high enough to make his sword a force to be reckoned with, especially when coupled with Keen Edge, GMW, Flame Weapon, and Extended Hastes.  In one of my original incarnations, I went Ftr4/CoT8/Sorc8 pre-epic, and while he gets 16BAB that way, I wasn’t satisfied with the Sorcerer maturation.  Sacrificing 1 attack and going to the 15BAB actually made the build more fun to play.  I rarely miss that last attack anyway since it’s fairly low.  A Fighter5/COT5 isn’t optimal saves-wise, it allowed for the maximum possible bonus feats in Epic (4).  <br><br>At the end of the day, he’s just a spellsword, and I decided to resurrect it after some discussions in this thread, <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=646980&amp;forum=42" target="_blank">Melee Sorcerer</a>.

Grizz, everything seems to be good at first glance. A pretty solid spellsword, IMO. Well done, as usual. Funny you should post this, as I've got something in a somewhat similar vein in the works.<br><br>Oh, and I quite agree on the 3 attacks. I've built several spellswords that 'suffer' only 3 attacks due to getting more caster levels earlier, and I find they're (as you noted) more fun and just as viable as builds with the 4th attack.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Grizz, this is sooo elegant!  Rarely do you come across a sorc build that ISNT feat starved!  Especially when you are going for MELEE AND CASTING abilities.

I'm impressed you manage to keep posting builds. I'm already dry of good ideas.<br><br>I'd take EWS earlier, it's not all that important, but it's a pretty neat feat to try to get fast. You could grab it at level 22 switching Great Charisma I and EWF, taking the Fighter level earlier.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>21 Sorcerer11, <b>Great Chr I</b><br>...<br>...<br>...<br>38 Sorcerer26, <b>Great Chr I</b><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Heh, you take Great Charisma I two times <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"> <br><br>Nice build by the way.

I moved the first FTR lvl to Lvl 2 and just did a slight adjustment around.  I tested it in a Mod every 5 levels and Lord have mercy it kicked butt everytime.
