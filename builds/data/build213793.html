A nice little slasher. You dont post your final AC, but it's something like 11, right? I seriously would favor warhammer over scimitar if you are a Halfling. Saves you a feat, or else you need 18 lvl's before you qualify as a WM. I think that your cheese-level of rogue is well spent if you can get Tumble in there. It gives you 8 AC. Whats your damage with Scythe? A crit will carve up even Superman possibly. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br>But your defense will be a problem possibly. Low AC a few hp's.<br>I think a Halfling with Warhammer would rock!

This is a bit of a munchkin build and there are things that i dont like about it.<br><br>The geral idea is its a fairly good soloing build with only 1-2 weaknesses.<br><br>1) low AC and no DR, does compinsate with spells<br>1a) kinda low saves in some cases<br>2) Very dependant on spells which that can be dispelled<br><br><br>I would like to have many more RG lvls, and the only reason for cleric lvl 23 is for that extra feat and longer duration of Undeaths Eternal Foe. Im not even sure why i have lvl 9 clerical spells there are very few (one or two really) that i can use. plus i have to waist an extra feat to get that wis up to 19 from 18 o be able to cast those spells. <br>I just put Hellball there to add to the offensive flavor of the build.<br><br>But it seems to me, that overall, the combat and playing capabilities of this build will only improve with 19 WM lvls (armored skin) and enough RG levels to get full tumble. a +10 AC overall, more sneak attack and they arrives sooner along with all the other RG skills. <br>maybe  a WM 19/RG 5/CL 16 ?<br>Ac is up by 10, AB by 1 (with scythe) spells and domain powers are weaker.

I don't think that's the case, even though the documentation would suggest it is. I'm pretty sure you need Dodge, Mobility, and Spring Attack only, but I can't swear to it (it just seems to me I recall taking Expertise after Whirlwind in a build before). I could be wrong about this though. Hmmmm, it may bear a test in a leveller.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Okay, just tested using a Human Rogue. You are correct, Avado. Expertise is, indeed, required for Whirlwind Attack, according to my testing. I had Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, and BAB +9 and was unale to select Whirlwind (didn't show up as a feat choice). After selecting Expertise, Whirlwind was available on the next feat level.<br><br>Good call, Avado.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
