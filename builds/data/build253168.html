<b>Whadd'ya think? Hacks and slashes, playable enough. PvM, possibly PvP.</b><br><br>Yep, Ladies and Gentlemen, a WM7 build from Valhalla's coming einherjer.

Oh man, a Ranger with a scythe--arguably the favored weapon of Rangers given their farmy/barnyard backgrounds.  Looks pretty mean.  When Scythe is your WoC, I don't see any problems in taking only 7 levels.  I like what Ranger gives you over a ton of WM levels.<br><br>Nice one.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Golly gee wowsers. That's ... that's quite a ranger. Even more damage than the last uber-offensive ranger.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

Well done Grim, a scythe wielding Ranger ain't that common... you know they are supposed to be archers! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>I'm no big fan of WM 7 builds either but still there are some combos that benefit from it. Scythe wielding builds almost beg for WM. The AC might be low (why Rangers don't get Barkskin is beyond me), saves might be crap but that damage output is so sweet.
