Hey folks, atlast i got a reply from Anuis on my request to join you guys <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  For those who doesnt know me then im a huge fan of nwn and luvs to come up with new builds and share em with others. Iv been playing nwn for hmm, about 3-3½ years i guess and been on a server known as ZL (or 24/7 Zombieland for most of the time). And to start with then ill post a few of my newest builds (the ones that i can remember atm), im not just a "epic char builder" but a char builder overall, so expect to see some odd builds and sometimes builds that ends up at lvl 15, 20, 28 or 30 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Anyway, im glad i finaly got in and im sure i will have a good time here cuz iv been searching for ppl that are able to discuss their builds without getting totaly offended by others thoughts and suggestions <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">
