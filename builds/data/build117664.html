Now reposting my "Sparring Mage" originally known as Jushak Firestone, posted in the original thread. Race was changed from half-elf to human for bonus feat &amp; skill points. Feats at lvl up are now included (compared to "pick these" list I mostly use).<br><br>Sparring Mage - Human - Chaotic Good - Follower of Tymora<br>Ranger 9/Wizard 31<br><br>STR: 14<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 10<br>INT: 16 +10 level + 6 feat = 32 INT<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Dual wields, Main-Hand weapon any 1-handed, Off-Hand any small weapon. My choice was dual wielding Short Swords. For best melee damage (as you make counter attacks while parrying) use any 1d8 damage weapon in the Martial Weapon list, and a small weapon, such as 1d6 damage Short Sword.<br><br>Any mage feats may be taken at will, but the skillpoint calculation was made using this order (Great Int's ASAP)<br><br>Also, only 6 ranger levels are a must before hitting epic. This ensures that you get 12 (7 normal, 5 Wizard bonus feat) epic feats to complete your arsenal. I wanted to max BAB, as I was trying to get 4 attacks, but it proved futile (atleast 10 Ranger/MeleeClass needed for that).<br><br>Wizard 1. Combat Casting &amp; Spell Focus: Evocation, (Familiar: Raven called Morr)<br>Wizard 2.<br>Wizard 3. Greater Spell Focus: Evocation<br>Wizard 4.<br>Wizard 5. Spell Penetration<br>Wizard 6.

(40) Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>Skills: Concentration, Discipline, Lore, Parry, Hide, Move Silently 43. Spellcraft 40 &amp; Tumble 20. Left: 67. Parry Check: 62.<br><br>Stats:<br>HP: 234 (no re-rolls)<br>AC 16 (18 with armor skin)<br>For: 22<br>Ref: 18<br>Will: 20<br>BAB: 24<br>Attacks: 3 Main-Hand + 2 Off-Hand<br><br>Spells: 4 Cantrips, 8 lvl 1-3 spells, 7 lvl 4-7 spells, 6 8 &amp; 9 level spells.<br><br>About parry: I tested Parry only after the build was finished. It seems that you can't parry while casting (well, it would've been kinda funny if you could...). Also, even with 62 Parry check, you are never guaranteed to parry. Allthought I couldn't see my parry rolls, it seems that there is failure-on-roll-1 there too. Testing againts a bumbed up dracolich I seemed to parry only 3/5 attacks, either meaning that Off-Hand attacks are not counted for parry, or that Tymora wasn't with me (=bad dice rolls), or my Dracolich has suddenly gained 6th attack (have to check it later...).<br><br>Also, parry goes off when you move, which may be a real pain in mobile combat. Againts melee enemies however, parry should give you a good defensive bonus, without wasting too much resources. Also, it uses ranger. That has to count somewhere<br>_________________<br>"Lavamancers use three aspects of magic to make a golem: Transmutation; to mold the golem, Necromancery; to bind a soul to control the golem, and Evocation; to blast the damn thing on fire."<br>- Jushak Firestone - Grim Lavamancer<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 16:49</span></i></p>
