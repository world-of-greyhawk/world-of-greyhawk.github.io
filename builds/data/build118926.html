I think a charisma based pure paladin is a far better undead hunter than your build, for the following reasons :<br>-Divine might is far more powerful<br>-Lay on hands is very powerful (by the way, a critical hit on the touch attack doubles the damage)<br>-Smite evil is far more powerful<br>-Turn undead is very powerful as well, with many charges<br>-Divine shield can always help<br>AB will be a little lower, but it doesn't seem to be a problem since you are using improved power attack yourself.<br>If you're interested, I can post a funny build I had done on that base (a gnome pure paladin, focus charisma), but since it's pure paladin, it isn't very elaborated.<br><br>Also, why does your build have devastating critical ?<br>_________________<br>If you call IGMS, Harm, Mestil's acid shield, the Bigby hands or Devastating Critical balanced in your post, don't expect me to like you.<br><br>I'm sorry about my bad english, I'm french.<br>In every lie lies a part of truth.

Please don't nitpick names of builds. It might not suit your concept of an 'undead hunter' but it is a good build reguardless.<br><br>Also as this post is over 6 months old and I haven't seen Mith post a build in some time, I don't think you will get much response from him.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

A paladin's only means of hurting an opponent is through combat (he can turn undead, but he can't set traps, use offensive spells ...)  A CHA based paladin has a horrible AB, that comprimises his only means of offense.  They get other bonuses and divine might makes up for it a bit, if you can't hit your opponent all those abilities aren't worth anything.  <br><br>I included improved power attack in the calculations, but if I'm not hitting something I can always drop it for a +10 boost to my AB.  the 26 STR is good for a +8 to hit and Bane of enemies gives me another +2 against favoured enemies.  If your typical CHA based paladin has a STR of 14 that's a +2.  All things considered <i>with</i> improved power attack this character's AB is 2 points lower than a CHA based paladin.  They say the best defense is a strong offense, so maybe the strength serves me better. <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Also, why does your build have devastating critical ?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>For versatility,  something that CHA based paladins lack.  By choice of favoured enemy, this character does well against most critical hit immune opponents.  The devastating critical lets him do well against crit. vulnerable opponents as well.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
