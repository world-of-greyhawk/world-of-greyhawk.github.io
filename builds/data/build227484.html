Can't.  It's a Weapon Master epic bonus feat, so you have to take an epic feat with it (from the Weapon Master's bonus feat list).  The other viable option there is Improved Whirlwind, but I don't like Whirlwind Attacks, so I went with Epic Prowess.

If you can live without your sole level of Shadowdancer, I'd replace it with a single fighter level pre-epic at level2, enabling you to pick weapon finesse 16 levels earlier, and then at level 18 you could pick blind-fight. And since 20 levels of rogue don't give you anything more than 19 levels, you could grab a second level of fighter somewhere in epic or pre-epic to nab an extra feat, something like toughness maybe, for an extra 40HP, or KD.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Saosin777 on 01/19/06 05:18</span></i></p>

If I were going to swap the SD level and a Rogue level for two Fighter levels, the two feats I'd pick up are KD and IKD, and the focus would move away from stealth and toward a knockdown/sneaker.  The HiPS is sort of key to the build concept, though (it's supposed to be a stealth-based character), so I'd rather not do that.  It's not that it would be worse (it would probably be better), but it's a different build.

Assuming play from Level 18 up, I would suggest taking Rogue16 at Lvl22.  This gets you Epic Dodge 5 levels earlier, and is a much bigger tie-breaker than anything WM has to offer.  Also get a Tumble Drop at Lvl22.<br><br>Or am I overlooking something?  I noticed you took a Rogue level at every spot where you take an SC Feat.  SC is still a General feat, and you can take it on a general feat level in spite of your class.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 01/19/06 17:37</span></i></p>

You're right about the Rogue 16 earlier.  As for taking Rogue on SC levels, I wasn't sure if you had to do it that way (like you have to take a Paladin or Cleric level if you want to take the Divine feats), and I figured that even if you didn't, it was a convenient way to space out the levels in which I could take Tumble/UMD.

I built the same guy as human.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225555", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>I got not much feedback though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">   . I get AB 1 lower, same AC, HiPS at lvl 8 and Finesse at lvl 3. That makes it much more playable, actually, it makes it WAY more playable. Yours have SC V, which i could not fit in a human build. It can be cast from scrolls though. I get 86 skillpoints more also. This is a tough build, and was unique. Weapon finesse at lvl 18 is a no go, at least without HiPS, you have none of those, which makes it HARD to level. You HAVE TO fit at least 1 of those, or play multiplayer in a party.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 01/23/06 15:14</span></i></p>
