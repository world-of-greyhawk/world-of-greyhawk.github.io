Hey all, I've got another quest. I'm looking for a build that has above average sneak attacks and can hold it's own both in sneaking and PvP. I play on a WoT server so HiPS can't be my main PvP crutch, but it's nice to have.I was hoping it'd be something race Human/Elf, doesn't have to be playable from 1-40, A good amount of skill points. Hopefully also Dex based, doesn't really matter but if there's a choice with no real difference I'd probably go for Dex and ED. It's probably going to be half RP build and it's going to be a Child of the Light if that gives you any inspiration.<br><br><br>HN<br>_________________<br>"He was happily married.. but his wife wasn't"-Victor Borge

Rogue 20-24/Bard 4-6/PM 10-16, halfling dexer dual wielder, ED, SCV or Epic Spells, PM immunities. Great AC, AB on the 40 mark, UMD, trap skills, good SAs, good stealth... a meleer's bane. No child of the light though...<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

Oh, there's always the standard Rogue 25/Fighter 14/SD 1 build. Can get ED/SCV, dual wield, WS/EWS, etc. Works best as a halfling, not sure how well that fits in with the WoT. ELf will have an XP penalty, which may or may not matter to you. Human also works, but ends up with lower Dex, and may have a tougher time fitting in SCV.<br><br>TM

How about Rogue 25 / Monk 10 / Shadowdancer 5, with R 8 / M 8 / SD 4 at level 20? He would have to be human if you want to avoid EXP penalty, but that would cost you 2 DEX. 6 pre-epic levels of Monk gives you IKD, and 2 more for the rule of 4. 1 level of SD gives you HiPS, and 3 more for the rule of 4. The 9th level of Monk gives you Improved evasion without using up a Rogue feat, and likewise for SD 5 giving you Defensive Roll. The 10th level of Monk gives you +1 AC.<br><br>Since you are not relying on HiPS, you might choose to trade the 5 SD levels and the 10th Monk level for 6 levels of Fighter, making it R 25 / M 9 / F 6, with R 8 / M 8 / F 4 at level 20. This gains you another attack per round and +6 damage from WS / EWS, and 2 more feats too. The downside is you get an EXP penalty even as a human, you lose the +1 AC from Monk 10, and you have to use one of your Rogue feats for Defensive Roll. Oh, and you lose some skill points.<br>_________________<br>Great Research Tools:<br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWNWiki</a><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">NWN Epic Character Build Search Engine</a><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/" target="_blank">The NWN Vault</a>

Probably going to go with 25 Rogue/ 9 Monk/ 6 fighter. Also, is it Dex or Str based. Any suggested weapons?<br>_________________<br>"He was happily married.. but his wife wasn't"-Victor Borge<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Honer Nerd on 07/21/08 02:52</span></i></p>

With monks level, unarmed or kama for the attacks progression.<br>Look at <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225896", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>this build</a>, TM is still here so he might give you some recent advice <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

The build that Valeren linked to would get rid of experience penalty for either human or halfling, and since you're going to be born at level 40, it doesn't matter that you don't get Knockdown until level 23. With only 9 levels of Monk, you definitely want to go with Kamas instead of unarmed.<br><br>If you choose human instead of halfling, you will want to dual-wield kamas, taking the three dual-wielding feats suggested in the comments to the build. Also, if you change it to human, start with 16 DEX, 14 STR, and 12 INT (for the same number of skill points). You still will qualify for Epic Dodge at the same time.<br>_________________<br>Great Research Tools:<br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWNWiki</a><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">NWN Epic Character Build Search Engine</a><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/" target="_blank">The NWN Vault</a>

If the character is born at level 40, then there's no reason to worry about an XP penalty at all.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

It's been a while since I have played Felonius. For WoT, I would either play it as a female halfling (RP as a Cairhienin), or as a human. If you go human, drop Dodge and Mobility for the ITWF series. Note that going Human will cost you 2 AB. If you are born at level 40, you could also go Elf to only lose 1 AB. <br><br>What level do you start at? I thought WoT was a 1-40 RP world...<br><br>TM
