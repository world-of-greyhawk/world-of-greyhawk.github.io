Crack!!  You hear, as blood gushes from your head, still throbbing from the heavy rock that just hit you.  From behind you, you hear a shrill cry: "Don't f00k with the forest!!!"  Turning, you see what looks like a heavily armored warrior, but from his silly demeanor you can tell it must be another one of those damned tree-hugging hippies.  You rush at him with your axe, determined to show him just what a lumberjack can do.  "Your mother is a hamster!!!" he shouts at you, as you close in on his nature-loving arse.  Suddenly, a massive red dragon appears before you, its torn plate armor clattering on the ground next to it.  With one swift flick of the wrist, the dragon knocks you onto the ground and proceeds to tear into your tree-chopping hide.  Mama always told you there would be days like this...<br><br>Dragon Slinger<br><br>Rogue 13/Druid 20/Monk 7<br>(pre-epic Rogue 4/Druid 12/Monk 4)<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 14<br>Con 15<br>Int 12 <br>Wis 16<br>Cha 8<br><br>9 points into Wis, last point into Con<br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 14<br>Con 16<br>Int 12 <br>Wis 30<br>Cha 8<br><br>1 Point Blank Shot, Rapid Shot<br>3 Extend Spell *<br>6 Zen Archery <br>9 Weapon Focus: Sling<br>12 Toughness *<br>15 Heavy Armor Proficiency *<br>18 Empower Spell *<br>21 Epic Weapon Focus: Sling<br>24 Great Wis I<br>27 Great Wis II<br>30 Great Wis III<br>33 Great Wis IV<br>35 Rogue: Improved Evasion<br>36 Great Wis V <br>38 Rogue: Crippling Strike<br>39 Dragon Shape <br><br>Note: Feats with * next to them are not critical to the build, and could be swapped out for something else if you wanted it, possibly Spell Pen. and/or Greater Spell Pen.    <br><br>Epic lvl progression:<br><br>21 Monk<br>22 Rogue<br>23 Monk<br>24 Rogue<br>25 Rogue<br>26-32 Druid<br>33-38 Rogue<br>39 Druid<br>40 Monk<br><br>Equipment:<br><br>Full Plate<br>Tower Shield<br>Sling<br><br>Note: The point of wearing the Full Plate and Tower Shield is that the items will merge when you shift into Dragon form, giving you a nice bonus to AC.  That said, <br>these items tend to screw up your stealth skills while not in dragon form, and it's possible to get a higher AC in your birthday suit (sans armor).  So, if you prefer, <br>feel free to run around naked.

Although he gets Dragon Shape, the most powerful of all shape change feats, he is far from gimped in his human form.  <br><br>He has a decent caster lvl to overcome SR, and Nature's Balance can help with that as well.  He can command fire and lightning, and summon swarms of insects to eat his opponents alive.  He can heal himself to full with a single spell, yet still do a remarkable amount of damage at a decent AB with naught but a little sling.  His AC is respectable as well, even while he's running around stark raving naked like hippies tend to do.  His HP and saving throws are both decent, and he has plenty of skill credits to go around, despite having a mediocre 12 Int.  All in all, a versatile yet powerful character, and he should be damn fun to RP if that's what you're into.

I think only sneak attacks (and magical ammo) will increase his very low 1-4 damage, but you don't have them with each attack.<br><br>Apart from that, a good character. Well, if you want to RP him, you shouldn't use plate mail, as druids cannot use metal armor (exception: worshippers of Mielikki, who can also use meduim armor). Not to mention that with Owl's Insight, your AC is better when wearing only clothes then when fully armored.

Hehe great concept. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br><br>HOWEVER, let me clear one thing up.<br><br>When you shift into dragon form, the base AC bonuses (8 from full plate, 3 from tower shield) vanish.

Even though the base damage is 1-4, with sneaks you can do 8-47 (+Str bonus if you have a sling with Mighty on it), although you're right, it isn't every hit.  <br><br>As for the armor bonuses not stacking, I was not aware of that.  In that case, just get rid of the Heavy Armor Proficiency and either Toughness or one of the Metamagic feats (Extend/Empower spell), and pick up Spell Pen. and Greater Spell Pen. instead.  You could still go with the sling, although if you're not wearing a shield you might as well use a bow.  I think Rogues get access to shortbows; I'm not sure whether Druids get bow proficiencies or not.  <br><br>As for Improved Knockdown, you get that for free on your 6th lvl of Monk, so no need to raise Int.

I'd do with called shot over thougness. Zen Archery and Druids are all about slowing your opponements down to zero, and thus forcing them to spend more time within your crazuy AOE-spells like creepin doom.

Apart from the rp value, why take WF and EWF in sling?<br><br>I'd opt for two other feats of more value to your build.<br><br>Improved Critical: Unarmed and Epic Prowess are two that spring to mind.<br><br>Why Monk 7? Stopping at Monk 6 would be better. The 7th level only brings you skills really.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 03/02/06 06:27</span></i></p>
