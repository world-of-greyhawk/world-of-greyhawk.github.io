I have not seen a built like this yet.  If I have missed it please post here and we will add it to my post.<br><br>Silent Hunter (Ranger 35, Shadowdancer 5)<br><br>The arrow came out of the shadows and pierced the sentry's heart.  He dropped without a sound.  The sentry next to him dropped with one more arrow.  One more sentry dropped to leave an opening between the camp and the forest.  He crept close to the main tent with no one noticing and waited.  Finally the leader appeared with his guards.  Two quick arrows eliminated the leader.  Arrows took two of the guards before the other guards closed on the assailant.  The stranger’s blades finished the other 4 guards before the rest of the camp could react.  As the camp closed on the stranger, he disappeared before their eyes.  Back in the forest, the stranger smiled to himself.  He had no mercy.  After all the Orcs never had mercy on his family.<br><br>Race: Human (for the extra skills) or Elf (for higher Dex)<br>Alignment:  I play Any Good, but it is up to you.<br>PvM or PvP depends on the nature of your server.

What do levels 2 through 5 of SD bring to the build?  Wouldn't it be better to spend those levels on something like Fighter for EWS that would actually improve the build's performance?  And if you are going to take that many levels of SD, shouldn't you at least have a tumble dump at 37-40 (it's not like you'd hurt playability by delaying SD 5 that long, since it brings less to the build than just getting your Ranger levels earlier would)?<br><br>Unless you're using it for Epic Dodge, I really don't get the point of more than 1 level of SD.

Dex-based rangers isn't really playable until the epic-levels. Where the FE's start to do some good, and the equipment usually let's you do some damage.<br><br>Dropping at least to Ranger30 and loose only -1 to your FE-bonuses will easily be worth it to obtain ED.<br><br>I'd take it even further down as suggested. 26 is the most perfect place to end most Ranger. Then take Rogue as a second Class with 1 level of SD for HiPS. You'd be amazed atthe performance and the build won't be that different. You just add sneak attacks, skillpoints and ED at the cost of a little hitpoints and -2 to your FE bonuses. And you must necessarily loose some of the FE's. <br><br>If you really want 35 Ranger, that is viable. Switch out 4 SD levels either for Fighter (EWS/feats, but loose Uncanny) or Rogue(some sneak-attack, UMD) is what lies at the frontline of my thoughts.<br>I really can't see what SD levels 2-5 brings you that something else won't do better.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

If you're trying to get him to drop it to Ranger 26, I'd say Ranger 26/Fighter 4/SD 10 would be a much better proposition.  The +6 damage would probably do this build more good than a few SA dice.
