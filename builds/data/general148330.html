Hey all,<br><br>I'm sort of new to wizards.  I have been trying to figure a good build for a wizard and i was thinkin of working either an almost pure wizard (38-39/1) (the world i play is really tough without a fightr lv or 2)  or a 29wiz/1ftr/10 pm   type build.  I am wondering how much of a differnce loosing 10 or so wizard lvls makes to a build? - yes theres the epic feats missd..  but what is the result to the casters endin power?  <br><br>I thank you for any suggestions.<br><br>Peace

First one is on the Epic build forum of this guild, the other two Emrill and I have not posted yet.

SO if i understand this:  the only reason to play a wizard to lv 40 pure is for pvp?<br><br>So, i am also safe to assume that in a challenging pw where it has a rest delay a few lvls or a warrior type with pm is a good thing (with still spell and auto still).  <br><br>Thanks for the help.<br><br>Peace

Yes there is nothing in pvm that having only 20 levels of wizard couldn't handle. That for pvm gives you every spell slot you can get.

Again, thank you.<br><br>So then, what does taking a wizard to lv 40 give you?  O(other than the wiz bonus skills)?

I believe it gives you:<br>- more spell slots for memorizing<br>- better chance to pass SR
