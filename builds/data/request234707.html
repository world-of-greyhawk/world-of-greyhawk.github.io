Lately whenever I think on a powerbuild it's easy to see it made at least 4 times before.... the guild has a lot of builds, and I don't want to make a build like someone else's build, although there's nothing wrong about it, it just doesn't feels like "my build"...<br><br>I went on with the build searcher trying out weirdly stupid combinations.... and some are even there, I got amazed to find an AA/WM, but there is one, after some time I came to realize my super powerbuild with no matches on the searcher was made out of 3 prestige classes, lol.<br><br>So, as it gets so far, a non-made build which sounds somewhat promising to me is a Bard /Arcane Archer / Dwarven Defender, I came to like the Dwarven Defender class a lot, and it's curious that there isn't information about it on those stickied topics, I might make my own information topic about DD... but later on.<br><br>Right now, on with the Bard/AA/DD build, Bard 9 / AA 17  DD 14 would get an Enchant arrow of 8, a DR of 18, regular bardsong and some buffs, Tumble, UMD, Discipline and Spellcraft.... good HP as always, with the needed 21 CON for EDR, and good AB as every AA gets, sounds like a neat character isn't it?

Arcane Archer needs to be an Elf or Half-Elf; <b>Dwarven</b> Defender has to be a... Dwarf?
