"Shall we stop here, milady?"  He glanced back at his mistress, and she seemed weary, fatigued, and nearly ready to fall from her saddle.<br><br>"Aye, Miles, this is fine."<br><br>Miles dismounted and began making camp.  As he busied himself with a campfire and food preparations, he looked again to his mistress.  She had tethered her steed to a nearby oak, and was slumped heavily against the tree.  Her once fair face was ashen, and her dark eyes were distant.  She had taken ill ever since she had learned of her Father's death. She had not been the same since.<br><br>"Here's some wine, milady," Miles offered her a flask. <br>"Thank you, Miles," as she sipped from it delicately.<br>"And some venison--"<br>"No thank you, Miles."<br>"Milady," Miles protested, "You need to keep your strength if we are to complete our pilgrimage."<br><br>Miles was about to chastise her more when he noticed that she wasn't even listening to him, but rather had cocked her head to one side as if listening.<br>"What is it?"<br>"Horses, Miles, horses. Four to be exact. Fetch my blade. Leave the armour, there isn't time"<br>"Aye, milady."<br>He scrambled to his Lady's horse, pulled from the saddle a blade nearly as tall as he, and returned back.  His mistress was struggling to get up.<br>"Help me, Miles,"  she laboured.<br>He reached down and pulled her to her feet. He then strapped the great blade across her back just as four heavily armored knights, in a cloud of dust and heavy hooves, thundered into their camp.  Their blue eyes flashed through their helms, and they bore burnished shields and spears of gleaming steel.  These were Cormyrean Knights, their visage proud, their countenance fierce, their retribution swift.<br><br>"Who are you and what is your business in the King's lands?" spoke their commander, who reined his horse just short of the Lady.<br>"We are but travelers," she said feebly, "pilgrims, making our journey westward.  We have no quarrel with you or your King."<br>"You trespass," the Commander stated flatly, "you trespass on the King's private lands."<br>"We are sorry," she said quietly. "We are but strangers here, and there were no signs.  We meant no harm."<br><br>The commander studied her for a moment, and found himself captivated by her fairness.<br>"Fortune is with you this day, fair pilgrim," and the knight commander flashed her a smile.  "You won't be arrested.  We have another quarry.  Spies tell us that the dreaded Shrike has entered the land, and was just spotted last night in a village 20 miles west of here."<br><br>"The 'Shrike'?" she raised an eyebrow.<br>"Aye, you'd best keep a guard at night.  The Shrike is a terrible warlock-creature who can kill with his voice.  There's half of a village burying the other half this very hour.  The beast came among them last night and let loose with its deadly voice."<br>"How will you be able to defend yourself?" the Lady asked.  "Surely there's a way to stop this thing?"<br>"Worry not with that, fair lady," and he leaned back and gave a haughty laugh.  "We are no conscripts! I am the King's Champion, and these knights that ride with me are handpicked by the King himself.  The Shrike wouldn't dare face us."<br><br>"King's Champion, you say...,” she said blankly, and Miles noted that she seemed distant again.  <br>"Aye, so you've heard of me."<br>She looked up to where he sat proudly in his saddle.  "You slew the man known as The Bastard...."<br>The commander's face darkened. He wheeled his horse around her, and tapped the greatsword fastened to her back.<br>"I've never heard of pilgrims armed so heavily."<br>"Even pilgrims take precautions, milord," she stated over her shoulder.  "No roads are safe these days."<br>"Indeed," remarked the Commander.<br>"Please, good sirs," Miles blurted, "We only seek passage. Please let us continue!"<br>"Quiet, Miles."<br>"Do your people always let servants speak to their superiors so?" the Commander questioned.  <br>And he held her gaze for several heartbeats.<br><br>But the Lady was silent.  She stood calm, tall and beautiful, with her head thrown back as the sinking sun danced upon her dark locks of hair.  Whatever ailment had plagued her earlier, Miles could no longer see a trace of it.<br><br>"I do not care for your arrogance, woman," the Commander sneered. "Perhaps you and your man-servant both need a lesson in etiquette."<br>"Perhaps..." she whispered, and a shadow passed across her face.  <br>"Who did you say you were?" the Commander was clearly getting agitated.  His horse stamped, and the other knights looked back and forth to one another.<br>"I...," she said softly, sliding the greatsword from across her back.  "I am the Bastard's daughter...."<br><br>Later that evening, as they silently departed from their camp, Miles looked over his shoulder at the four men, naked and bound, hanging by their wrists from the bough of the great oak.  Around each of their waists were hung salted meats, and their faces and hands were stained purple with wine.  But they were not gagged.  <br><br>Miles remembered his mistress telling them, "You are fortunate this day, for this day you choose your fate.  I leave you ungagged so that you can call for help.  But know that this area is rife with wolves.  Your calls are more likely to bring them, who will in a pack-frenzied madness, attempt to pull you and the meats that hang around your waist down to the earth where they will rend your flesh.  Or, you could wait until daybreak and hope someone on the road will spot you, or come for you.  But know that this oak is riddled with venomous fire ants that will be attracted to your wine-stained faces.  There will be thousands that swarm your skin, and I have literally seen them eat men alive. They're really quite efficient little eaters.  If you manage to survive that, there are still the vultures, which will flock to you in droves to peck at your remains.  It's all a bit tragic really.  Especially given where that meat is hanging from your waist.  Fare thee well, and let it not be said that I am without mercy."<br><br>_________<br><b>The Shrike</b><br>aka, The Bastard's Daughter<br><i>n</i>, <b>1</b> Any of various carnivorous oscine birds of the family Laniidae, having a <i>screeching call</i> and a strong hooked bill with a tooth-like projection, and often <i>impaling its prey on sharp-pointed thorns or barbs of wire fencing</i>.  <b>2</b>any of numerous Old World birds having a strong hooked bill that feed on smaller animals<br>_________<br><br><br><br>This goal of this character was to have a deliciously juicy evil character that could deliver the best possible Bardsong to the best possible Epic Fiend.  Along the way, she gets an impressive array of nasty tricks, and is fun for the whole family.  Some will note that there is only 2 fighter levels.  This is only to preserve an 18BAB pre-epic, and to nab 2 needed feats for the build.  Some might suggest dropping BG levels in order to get the Ftr's WS/EWS, but truth betold, she doesn't need it.  She does a nice chunk of damage all by herself.  <br><br>Other might note that there are no Divine opportunities in the build.  It is my opinion that Blackguards just can't compete with Paladins in that category.  And while Smiting is good clean fun, I still find it hard to justify a major commitment to Charisma for something of limited use.  I just think of Blackguards as wonderfully delicious fighters complete with sneak attacks, great summon spells, better saves, Taunt, Bulls Strengths and the list goes on and on.<br><br><br><br><b>The Shrike</b><br>Bard16/BG22/Ftr2<br>Race: Human <br>Alignment: Neutral/Evil Chaotic Evil<br><b>Playable 1-40, PvM</b><br><br>Str16(30)<br>Int14<br>Wis8<br>Dex10<br>Con14<br>Chr14(16)<br><br>1Bard1, Knockdown, Power Attack<br>2Fighter1, Weapon Focus: Great Sword<br>3Bard2, Blindfighting<br>4Fighter2, Cleave, Str17<br>5Bard3<br>6Bard4, Curse Song<br>7Bard5<br>8Bard6, Str18<br>9Blackguard1, Improved Knockdown <br>10Blackguard2<br>11Blackguard3<br>12Bard7, Still Spell, Str19<br>13Blackguard4<br>14Blackguard5<br>15Blackguard6, Improved Crit: Great Sword<br>16Blackguard7, Str20<br>17Blackguard8<br>18Bard8, Lingering Song<br>19Blackguard9<br>20Blackguard10, Str21<br>21Bard9, Great Str I<br>22Bard10<br>23Bard11<br>24Bard12, Great Str II, Str24<br>25Blackguard11<br>26Blackguard12<br>27Blackguard13, EWF: Greatsword, Great Str III<br>28Blackguard14, Str26<br>29Blackguard15<br>30Blackguard16, Great Charisma I, Epic Fiendish Servant<br>31Bard13<br>32Bard14, Chr16<br>33Blackguard17, Epic Skill Focus: Taunt<br>34Blackguard18<br>35Blackguard19, Epic Prowess<br>36Blackguard20, Great Str IV, Str28<br>37Bard15<br>38Blackguard21<br>39Blackguard22, Armor Skin, Great Str V<br>40Bard16, Str30<br><br>AC: 28 (common full plate)<br>AC with Bard/Curse Song: 35<br><br>AB: 42/37/33/27<br>AB Bard/Curse Song/ 2 Bulls/ GMW/Taunt: 64/59/54/49<br>Base Damage: 2-12 +15Str <br>Buffed Damage: 2-12+24Str +3Bardsong +5GMW +2Warcry (+7d6sneak) = 2-12+34(+7d6sneak)<br>Hit Points: 416 (436)<br>Skill Points: 253<br><br>Fort: 27 (36)<br>Reflex: 22 (31)<br>Will: 21 (30)<br><br>Discipline: 43 (53)<br>Tumble: 40<br>Taunt: 43 (56), (60 with Bardsong)<br>Spellcraft: 43 (45)<br>Use Magic Device: 32 (35)<br>Perform: 27(30)<br>Listen: 10<br>Lore: 5 (23)<br>Heal: 5<br>Hide: 5<br><br><b>Blackguard Powers:</b><br>Bulls Strength<br>7d6 sneak attack<br>Dark Blessing<br>Smite Good<br>Create/Turn Undead<br>Summon Fiend<br>Inflict Serious/Critical Wounds<br>Contagion<br><br><b>Spells Known</b><br><br>1st(5)-- Protection from Align, Mage Armor, Grease, Cue Light Wounds, Identify<br>2nd(4)-- Clarity, Bulls Strength, Cats Grace, Ghostly Visage<br>3rd(4)-- Wounding Whispers, Keen Edge, Cure Serious Wounds, Greater Magic Weapon<br>4th(4)--: Improved Invisibility, Warcry, Dismissal, Summon Creature IV<br>5th(4)-- Ethereal Visage, Summon Creature V, Mind Fog, Greater Dispelling<br>6th(2)-- Energy Buffer, Ice Storm<br><br><b>Spell Castings (without Item Enhancements)</b><br><br>1st-- 5 Stilled, 5 Unstilled<br>2nd-- 4 Stilled, 5 Unstilled<br>3rd-- 4 Stilled, 4 Unstilled<br>4th-- 2 Stilled, 3 Unstilled<br>5th-- 1 Stilled, 2 Unstilled<br>6th-- would need +6 to Charisma to cast from here<br><br>The Blackguard's Create Undead power calls forth one of my favorite pre-epic summons in the game, The Doom Knight.

When you awaken, you will have whichever spellslots it opened, and when it wears off, the only slot lost is the one it had granted.  This is how it should work.  If there is one spell left in the slot it granted, that spell is gone.  If you had 5, then there is 4.  Again, this is how it should work.  <br><br>Charisma enhancements conferred through items continuously grant you slots, up until the point you take them off.  If you happened to have 1 casting left in that slot, well, it is gone.  But that is how it should work.  I wouldn't consider that a bug, but more of a limitation by the engine.<br><br>SideQuest: What is worth investigating is that, if you are 9thBard with Harper powers, and cast Eagles before resting, then awake and know you have 1 hour, could you use Harpers Eagles to preserve your slots, then when the initial bard's Eagles wears off, cast another Bard Eagles while your spell slots are still being preserved by the harper's Eagles?  Each one overlaps the other, so the Eagles bonus would never drop(assuming die rolls are equivalent).  <br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 08/25/05 07:40:00 (GMT) -- Mick Dagger<br><br>The investment we are talking about here is 1 feat at the cost of another.<br>With no cha gear, you can get a +5 divine damage for 5 rounds 8 times per day.

I actually found Extra Smiting probably to be even nastier than Divine Feats, as she can raise her AB by +9 with Eagles and Equipment, and deliver 22points of Divine damage per stroke.  Not as many uses as Divine Might, but a bit more concentrated and lethal.  Would I drop Lingering for it?  Hmmm.... why not?<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 08/25/05 14:22</span></i></p>

When you awaken, you will have whichever spellslots it opened, and when it wears off, the only slot lost is the one it had granted.  This is how it should work.  If there is one spell left in the slot it granted, that spell is gone.  If you had 5, then there is 4.  Again, this is how it should work. </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Hold on a minute there, Grizz. You seem to be implying that, if you cast Eagle's with a duration of over 8 hours, your spell will still be in effect after you rest. My experience is that any time you rest, all your spells are cancelled immediately.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Charisma enhancements conferred through items continuously grant you slots, up until the point you take them off.  If you happened to have 1 casting left in that slot, well, it is gone.  But that is how it should work.  I wouldn't consider that a bug, but more of a limitation by the engine.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I'll have to look into the Eagle's Splendor spell and its effects to be sure, but try this as a test:<br><br>Take any CHA-based spellchucker that has fully rested, so he has all his spells and equip him with a +2 CHA item (grants at least 1 extra casting of some level). Then, without casting any spells at all, unequip, re-equip, unequip, re-equip, etc. the CHA item and see what happens to your spells. I've tried this and what happens is you eventually lose all your castings in the spell levels where the item grants extra castings.<br><br>For example, let's assume you get an extra level 1 casting per day with your Bard and he already has a base of 5 castings per day. The item makes it 6. Now, he unequips the item. Suddenly, he's down to 4 castings per day, not 5. If he puts the item on and takes it off again, he goes down to 3 castings left. The item (and spell, I assume - although I'll test to make sure) will actually rob him of spells if he takes it off or it expires.<br><br>This shouldn't happen. Compare to a WIZ or a Wisdom-based caster. If the WIZ casts Fox's Cunning, he'll get at least +2 INT, which will grant at least one extra spell slot. (of course, he can't use the slot, as he must rest to use it, and resting will wipe out the Fox spell, thus eliminating the slot). Same with equipping a +2 item. Extra spell slot. However, upon unequipping the item, he loses only the extra slot. He doesn't lose any castings he's already memorized.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;SideQuest: What is worth investigating is that, if you are 9thBard with Harper powers, and cast Eagles before resting, then awake and know you have 1 hour, could you use Harpers Eagles to preserve your slots, then when the initial bard's Eagles wears off, cast another Bard Eagles while your spell slots are still being preserved by the harper's Eagles?  Each one overlaps the other, so the Eagles bonus would never drop(assuming die rolls are equivalent).  <br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I think you should test this again Grizz.

Right, Cin.  I implied that Eagles thing because Mick Dagger impied it.  It is actually false.  You cannot cast it and carry over after rest.<br><br>Regarding spell slots, Eagles Splendour will not affect your spell slots.<br><br>Items, however, do.  If you equip, unequip, reequip, ad nauseum, you will eventually burn through all your slots.  That is not how it should work at all.

I seemed to remember it <i>did</i> work that way, but I'm willing to believe my memory's off on that. If you've tested it out and found it doesn't rob you of spell slots, then that's good news indeed!
