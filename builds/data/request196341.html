Hi all,<br><br><br>         I just saw Star Wars episode 3 and was thinking what would be a good Darth Vader build. I was thinking something like Paladin / Weapon Master (great sword) / blackguard or Paladin / Monk / blackguard as he starts off good and Lawful then ends up going over towards the dark side. Monk would show the discipline jed's have and also they don't wear armor etc. Weapon master shows the dedication to the lightsaber in this case  a greatsword etc.<br><br><br>           Any ideas or builds appreciated.<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick. Long ago I learned to strike swiftly and without scruple. I trouble no man without cause, but one who attacks me had best resolve himself to die!

Personally, I never thought of Vader being particularly skilled with a lightsaber for a jedi.  I always felt Vader relied more on the force than his saber.  Luke I thought was more focused on the saber, using the force to augment his skills.  If you think back to Empire, when they fight in cloud city, their saber duels were fairly even.  Vader was holding back and trying to disarm luke, but with Vader's degree of training he should have disarmed him much quicker if he had been a master saber duelist.  In RotJ, Luke didn't have any trouble fighting back Vader, though Vader was still the more powerful force wielder and Luke was holding back. I suppose Vader's injuries and age probably did decrease his skill.  <br><br>I suppose the first question is what is a Jedi in D&amp;D?  Unfortunately psionics weren't implemented in D&amp;D.  They have the ability to increase their physical attributes and influence the minds of others, the Sith can use the force offensively.  I would say a jedi is a cleric/bard a sith is more of a cleric/sorcerer.  So I would guess any combination of cleric with sorcerer or bard that focused on enchantment would more or less describe a force user.  I would probably make Vader a combo of all three cleric/bard/sorcerer.  I would make Luke a fighter/cleric/bard, Obi-Wan a ranger/cleric/bard, Yoda a cleric/bard/sorcerer and palpatine a bard/sorcerer (heavy on the sorcerer, with the bard levels mostly for the persuasion skills).  Those are my thoughts anyway.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Cleric/sorcerer/blackguard is what came to my mind at the moment I saw the name of this topic.<br><br>EDIT: And the second thought was - paladin/sorcerer/blackguard. Charisma based, but concentrated on divine shield/might and sorcerer spells (aka the Force) rather then smiting.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tengudor_t on 05/24/05 10:40</span></i></p>
