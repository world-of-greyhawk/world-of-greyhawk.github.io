Ok; this is gonna sound like a really daft question, but here goes.<br><br>Does str/dex [depending on type of melee] bonus count to the +20 limit?  What does, and how to best work with these limits for a low-base attack build [dexy wiz/rogue]?<br><br>For example; if my final base attack is 23 with dex of 30 [with finesse], making my bab around ~33 depending on melee factors, how much further using +5-or-better weapons and +12 dex total can I push this?  Would my limit be 53 (+20 limit), including the dex bonus from items?  or would my limit be 43 (base attack +20)?<br><br>Again, sorry this might be a daft query, just can't figure it out right.

Syrath thanks for getting back so quick.<br><br>Just to clarify; this would mean anything over what I have standing naked(or naked holding unenhanced favoured weapon)?  This would mean your base modifier (str or dex) is ignored for this limit, or taken into account?<br><br>Just trying to understand where the limit is posed.

From here you have a stackable +20 CAP from enchantment. So the max AB you will ever have (regardless of sources) is +73 AB. This could be for example enhance arrow 15 and a +5 bow. Or a +10 sword and a spell that enhances +10 AB. If you were to have a +10 sword and cast true strike (+20) you would still only recieve +20 AB from both.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

A quick tip for calculating any character's maximum AB. Get them to hold their weapon of choice (ie. the weapon they have taken focus feats in, if any) and make sure they are unbuffed and aren't wearing any magical items. Then add 26 to the current attack bonus on the character sheet.<br><br>It comes in handy for working out what AB buff-heavy character types like clerics are actually using.

I kept the following information regarding the only things that do not count towards the +20AB limit.  I took it from a post a long time ago, and made some updated changes.<br><br>Following Do NOT Count towards +20AB limit:<br><br>Attribute bonuses (STR for melee, DEX for ranged and melee with Weapon Finesse, Wisdom for ranged with Zen Archery and Charisma with Smite Evil and Smite Good)<br>Weapon Focus<br>Epic Weapon Focus<br>Epic Prowess<br>Superior Weapon Focus<br>Epic Superior Weapon Focus<br>Enchant Arrows (which, as I understand it, should be counted towards that limit as it's supposed to make enhanced arrows rather than confer a bonus to attack and damage)<br>Bane of Enemies<br>Small Stature<br>Nature Sense<br>Opportunist (for AoO)<br><br>Everything else counts towards the +20.  Please correct this is it's wrong.

Note that BaB is gained via classes and NOT ANYTHING ELSE! Ab is gained via anything else. It's the magical AB bonus that the rest counts for except feats and magical stats bonus.
