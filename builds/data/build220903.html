Looks like a really solid build. Great AB and nice DR. And it's Dwarven - what's not to like? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>Why Assassin over Rogue? For the spells? Or for the RP aspect? Rogue would give more skill points and a bonus feat at Rogue 10.<br><br>What's the sequence you use for leveling? Is that for an instant-40 environment? For normal leveling up you'd probably want to scatter in the 4 Assassin levels pre-epic (2, 7, 12, 17), yes?<br><br>Nice build.<br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br>Intelligent design is neither.

I built it and liked the idea, also RP wise. The spells are a nice addition even though this character with his high UMD will not have problems using the best spells to help him in his...tasks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">   Also I'm trying to be admitted in the dwarven assassin guild <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  <br><br>Now that you point it out though, I realize that rogue instead of assassin would make for a cool build too. As you said more skill points (also because you don't have to x-class anything to meet PC's prerequisites) for a higher set trap, evasion, possibly improved evasion at lvl 10(or crippling strike). The loss of spells doesn't really hurt you and also the death attack DC is really low (22). Mmmm... I could post it, even though Jennalee posted a similar build (Fg 8/WM 19/Rg 13) recently...but she chose a puny human <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>@Finn: let me know how the build fared!<br><br>Thanks all,<br>cheers<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 11/20/05 09:43</span></i></p>

I built him with Greataxe and he's fun. Hacks through 15/- DR like it wasn't there <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   I managed to land most of my IKDs, too - even against a Strength-based RDD.<br><br>The Rogue version loses some of the general sexyness of the Assassin class but is - as usual, which is truly a shame - a better choice. I would go with Crippling Strike but that's just personal preference. Some people will enjoy the defensive boost that Improved Evasion gives. Spamming Knockdown with Crippling Strike is a sure way to fame, however <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   When you have landed enough Crippling Strikes your opponent will get -3 Damage from their Strength (makes your 9/- DR feel like Epic Warding for the opponent) and will most likely be encumbered. Been there, done that <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>EDIT: <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif"><br>_________________<br>Now is my day's work done;<br>I'll take good breath:<br>Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of<br>blood and death.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 11/20/05 10:39</span></i></p>
