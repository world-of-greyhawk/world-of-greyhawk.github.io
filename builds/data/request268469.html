Ok so I need help.  I want to do too many things at once with my build.  I want a Short sword, dual wielding, critical hit master.  AND he has to have a significant amount of DwD levels and EDR 3 to resist damage since without a shield he will be hit a lot.  I know its a lot to ask for but thats why I turn to you fine folks.  A few things about the area I play:<br><br>Dev crit is disabled.<br>Energy resistance to go along with damage resistance is nice to have<br>low to mid magic world<br>will have access to keen shortswords<br><br>thanks for all the help in advance!

Here is the Dwarven Landslide build from Mithdradates.<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "204167", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> <br><br>Just something I found real fast, gotta go to work. Just make sure to start with 15 DEX and you will have to drop Toughness, Knockdown and Improved Knockdown for the 2 weapon fighting feats.

If you don't mind a suggestion, I would recommend skipping WM and taking some Rogue levels or Bard levels instead. You want a lot of DwD to get siginficant DR, so you would only have room for 7 WM levels, which requires 5 feats. You will get +1 AB, +2 to crit range, and +2 to multiplier. <br><br>Instead, spend 1 feat on Exotic weaponry, and use kukris. You end up with +1 crit range compared to a WM with shortswords (although at x2 instead of x3). Rogue will let you skill dump into Tumble and UMD, and pick up some sneak damage (useful for a dual-wielder). Bard won't give you the sneak damage, but will let you skill dump into Spellcraft and Taunt as well as Tumble and UMD. Plus you can use all arcane scrolls and wands without needing to make a UMD check, and the song will give you back the +1 AB you lost from WM.<br><br>Something like Fighter 10/DwD 26/Rogue or Bard 4<br><br>I can put together a build if you are interested.<br><br>TM

You lose the points in Set and Disarm traps, but those aren't critical. You could also drop PA and Cleave for IKD and something else, or drop Exotic weaps for shortswords and take IKD (but you lose 3 off your crit range).<br><br>Note that switching to WM7 instead of Rogue 4 means losing at least 3 DR, 4 AC (tumble), UMD, and you will need to find room for 3 more feats (Mobility, Expertise, Spring Attack, and WWA, but not exotics if you go back to SS). You will probably need to take another 6 fighter levels pre-epic to fit those in since all of your pre-epic feats are fairly critical now, so DwD levels will drop to 14, only giving you 9 DR from DwD plus 9 from Epic DR for a total of 18.<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 03/15/07 19:49</span></i></p>

TM makes some good points. If you are gonna dual wield and be a dwarven weapon master it is gonna 1. use all your pre epic feats. 2. not allow you to go very heavy on the DD side (you should have atleast 16 or 19 WM levels). Thats why I put the link to Miths' build. 16 levels of WM but only 14 DD and the 10 levels of fighter to get all the feats.

Heh heh, low to mid magic world means Cleric is strong, as simple as that, Dwarven Defender / Cleric / X is hell powerful in low to mid magic environments, Monk as third class is obviously powerful (although that won't fit your weapon selection, if that's important), Fighter is also great, Ranger, Rogue or Bard could also work. You can check my <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "248564", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Dwarven Abomination</a> for an example (it definitely doesn't fits directly since it uses Club Exploit, I just think it's a good example for probable stats you can get in such combination, although it doesn't dual-wields either, you really don't need to <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   )<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/15/07 23:45</span></i></p>
