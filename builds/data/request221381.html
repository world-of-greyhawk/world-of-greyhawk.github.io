What comes to my mind, if you're going for ultimate-cheese-super-killer (though I'm not really qualified to speak on this) is maybe add a Tumble class and cut down on the CoT levels (feats few and far between post-epic but good saves) - Bard comes to mind. You'll get Spellcraft as a class skill too and lots of other yummy things <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

Alternatively you could drop CHA to 16 and pump your WIS up instead, taking about 11 levels of Cleric, 10 of COT and 19 of Barb. <br><br>This lets you drop Armor Prof Heavy, allows you to cast in armor, increases your will saves and provides a whole host of buffs that can help you. Take Extend Spell instead to allow your buffs to last longer too.<br><br>Not forgetting that some domains have CHA dependent benefits, such as War, Strength, Trickery, etc. and yours only drops by 2 points by the end of the build doing this.

Hmm, a smiting Barbarian eh?  Different. A real quick and easy way to improve things a bit would be to slot in some Paladin levels for COT levels to give you a nice saves boost at not much cost and pick up divine might/shield to make use of your CHA.  This will obviously need a bunch of alignment changes though which could be annoying/impossible.  The paladin levels count towards smites so you don't lose out in the smite department.  Also consider starting with a lower CHA and higher STR since boosting to 18 costs a lot of ability points, and put a few towards STR during level up - wouldn't go over 26 CHA myself.  Quick mockup of the above (note after creating it VERY quickly I noticed I haven't picked up extra smiting and that since you take paladin you don't need heavy armor prof, some feat shifting should fix that):<br><br>Champion of Torm(14), Barbarian(21), Paladin(5), Human<br><br>STR: 16 (18)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 12<br>CHA: 16 (26)<br><br>Human: (Quick to Master)<br>01: Barbarian(1): Toughness, Armor Proficiency Heavy<br>02: Barbarian(2): Bb: (Uncanny Dodge I)<br>03: Barbarian(3): Weapon Focus: Battleaxe<br>04: Barbarian(4): CHA+1, (CHA=17)<br>05: Barbarian(5)<br>06: Barbarian(6): Knockdown<br>07: Barbarian(7)<br>08: Barbarian(8): CHA+1, (CHA=18)<br>09: Barbarian(9): Blind Fight<br>10: Barbarian(10)<br>11: Barbarian(11)<br>12: Barbarian(12): CHA+1, Power Attack, (CHA=19)<br>13: Paladin(1)<br>14: Paladin(2): P: (Smite Evil)<br>15: Paladin(3): Divine Might<br>16: Paladin(4): CHA+1, (CHA=20)<br>17: Champion of Torm(1)<br>18: Paladin(5): Divine Shield<br>19: Barbarian(13)<br>20: Barbarian(14): CHA+1, (CHA=21)<br>21: Barbarian(15): Epic Skill Focus: Intimidate<br>22: Barbarian(16)<br>23: Barbarian(17)<br>24: Barbarian(18): CHA+1, Great Charisma I, (CHA=23)<br>25: Barbarian(19)<br>26: Champion of Torm(2): Epic Weapon Focus: Battleaxe<br>27: Barbarian(20): Great Charisma II, (CHA=24)<br>28: Champion of Torm(3): CHA+1, (CHA=25)<br>29: Champion of Torm(4): Epic Prowess<br>30: Champion of Torm(5): Great Smite I<br>31: Champion of Torm(6): Great Smite II<br>32: Champion of Torm(7): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>33: Champion of Torm(8): Great Smite III, Great Smite IV<br>34: Champion of Torm(9)<br>35: Champion of Torm(10): Great Smite V<br>36: Champion of Torm(11): STR+1, Great Smite VI, (STR=18)<br>37: Champion of Torm(12)<br>38: Champion of Torm(13)<br>39: Barbarian(21): Terrifying Rage<br>40: Champion of Torm(14): CHA+1, Great Smite VII, (CHA=26)<br><br><br>If you can't switch alignment, you could sub in cleric for paladin I guess to get the divine might/shield and -1 ab with lower saves.<br><br>HHuman: (Quick to Master)<br>01: Barbarian(1): Weapon Focus: Battleaxe, Toughness<br>02: Barbarian(2): Bb: (Uncanny Dodge I)<br>03: Barbarian(3): Blind Fight<br>04: Barbarian(4): CHA+1, (CHA=17)<br>05: Barbarian(5)<br>06: Barbarian(6): Knockdown<br>07: Barbarian(7)<br>08: Barbarian(8): CHA+1, (CHA=18)<br>09: Barbarian(9): Power Attack<br>10: Champion of Torm(1)<br>11: Champion of Torm(2): Improved Critical: Battleaxe<br>12: Champion of Torm(3): CHA+1, Extra Smiting, CT: (Smite Evil), (CHA=19)<br>13: Barbarian(10)<br>14: Barbarian(11)<br>15: Cleric(1): Divine Might<br>16: Barbarian(12): CHA+1, (CHA=20)<br>17: Barbarian(13)<br>18: Cleric(2): Divine Shield<br>19: Barbarian(14)<br>20: Barbarian(15): CHA+1, (CHA=21)<br>21: Barbarian(16): Epic Skill Focus: Intimidate<br>22: Barbarian(17)<br>23: Barbarian(18)<br>24: Barbarian(19): CHA+1, Great Charisma I, (CHA=23)<br>25: Barbarian(20)<br>26: Champion of Torm(4): Epic Weapon Focus: Battleaxe<br>27: Barbarian(21): Great Charisma II, (CHA=24)<br>28: Champion of Torm(5): CHA+1, (CHA=25)<br>29: Champion of Torm(6): Epic Prowess<br>30: Champion of Torm(7): Great Smite I<br>31: Champion of Torm(8): Great Smite II<br>32: Champion of Torm(9): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>33: Champion of Torm(10): Great Smite III, Great Smite IV<br>34: Champion of Torm(11)<br>35: Champion of Torm(12)<br>36: Champion of Torm(13): STR+1, Great Smite V, (STR=18)<br>37: Barbarian(22)<br>38: Barbarian(23)<br>39: Champion of Torm(14): Great Smite VI, Great Smite VII<br>40: Barbarian(24): CHA+1, Terrifying Rage, (CHA=26)<br><br><br>Or if you want to be really cheesy, stick in enough sorc. levels for True Strike.

Thanks for the suggestions everyone. Cleric seems to be my best option(I don't like so many alignment changes, even when available), but with terrifying rage taken earlier than in jwlademann's build(very useful, and intimidate is all but useless in that version until 40).
