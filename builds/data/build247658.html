I believe it is your BAB that has to be +1 and this build uses 3 classes that all have the 3/4 BAB progression chart. So the BAB at level 3 for this build will still be 0. You should start with Rogue at level 1 and then you will have to take levels 2 and 3 as either both Monk or both Cleric in order to get the +1 BAB.

Yeah, if you read the fine print in my post above (its really really fine, but its there) you will note that I took Rogue, 2 cleric 2 monk, etc.  This gives you the nec ab and it works fine.  With the right gear it is tough as nails.  I have left this guy for a long time though cuz on my server, we get PRC epic spells... a cleric with WARDING AND EMA!!  You cant get those with 15 cleric so i made others, but it in no way detracts from the genius of this guy.<br><br>I am so glad this is still in interest!

I would recall you should be able to pick ED on any level as long as you meet the reqs.

That is correct.  It can be both a general and a bonus feat provided prereqs are met.  And this build still is legal, for Epic Dodge is chosen at what is now the minimum level for selection-- 27.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I asked because I read the feat on nwn.wikia.com and it clearly states "Type of feat: (epic) class" and "Rogue Epic Bonus Feats | Shadowdancer Epic Bonus Feats".

It's classified as a class feat because only characters with specific levels in certain classes can attain it due to pre-required feats(Defensive Roll which can only be gotten by going Rogue 10 or Shadowdancer 5 ). I hope I didn't mess that up. @_@

First,  dont put much faith in a website, especially when it is written so poorly.  That is the first mistake made by any builder.<br><br>Now, ED is "technically" a class feat because you need requisites that can only be gotten from Rogue or SD.  Notice that this build IS a rogue build?  Therefore, we have all the pre-requisites for ED possible.  Now, the feat ISNT a class feat in that you can only take it as a rogue or sd.  As long as you qualify for the feat, you can take it on any epic feat lv (21, 24, 27 etc).  You can also take ED on a bonus feat for rogue or SD IF you qualify for it.<br><br>btw, there is very little info that I trust out there about nwn (that is not on epic builders forum).  Things posted here are tested by many players and debated ALOT.  It still surprises me, for example, that people still dont understand the power of DIvine Power and having 3 APR, which we discussed ALOT in the past.  IOW, if its here, it is more than likely correct, especially builds as old as this one (obviously, patch fixes aside).<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/28/06 00:22:49 (GMT) -- TyrTemplar<br><br>This post is for general information purposes only, and does not constitute a legal opinion or render any legal advice.
