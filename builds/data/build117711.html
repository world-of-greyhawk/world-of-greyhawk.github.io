Hey everyone. This is the first build I've posted here so tear it apart where you feel it's needed  . Without further ado, I present:<br><br>The Dwarven Clanfather<br>Race: Dwarf (duh)<br>Alignment: Lawful Anything (I recommend good)<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>Strength-17<br>Dexterity-13<br>Constitution-16<br>Wisdom-14<br>Intelligence-8<br>Charisma-6<br>Progression:<br>Pre-Epic:<br>4-Strength<br>8-Strength<br>12-Strength<br>16-Constitution<br>20-Wisdom<br>Epic:<br>24-Strength<br>28-Strength<br>32-Strength<br>36-Strength<br>40-Strength<br><br>Classes: Cleric 10/Dwarven Defender 22/Fighter 8<br>Progression:<br>Pre-Epic:<br>1-2: Fighter<br>3-7: Cleric<br>8-10: Fighter<br>11-20: Dwarven Defender<br>Epic:<br>21-24: Dwarven Defender<br>25-29: Cleric<br>30-32: Fighter<br>33-40: Dwarven Defender<br><br>Skills: Max Discipline (due to intelligence score, you only get one point per level)<br><br>Feats:<br>Pre-Epic:<br>1-Power Attack (General), Weapon Focus (Fighter)<br>2-Dodge (Fighter)<br>3-Cleave (General), Healing and War Domains (Cleric)<br>6-Toughness (General)<br>9-Combat Casting (General), Weapon Specialization (Fighter)<br>12-Improved Critical (General)<br>15-Great Cleave (General)<br>18-Knockdown (General)<br>*If you want to use an exotic weapon (e.g. dwarven waraxe), you can switch it for power attack at level 1, remove knockdown as a feat, and bump up the feats to the next feat level.<br>Epic:<br>21-Great Constitution I (General)<br>24-Great Constitution II (General), Epic Weapon Focus (Dwarven Defender)<br>27-Great Constitution III (General)<br>30-Great Constitution IV (General), Epic Weapon Specialization (Fighter)<br>32-Your choice-Armor Skin/Epic Prowess/Epic Toughness I (Fighter)<br>33-Overwhelming Critical (General)<br>36-Damage Reduction I (General), Damage Reduction II (Dwarven Defender)<br>39-Damage Reduction III (General)<br>40-Devastating Critical (Dwarven Defender)<br><br>So, there you have it. A dwarven fighter with a damage reduction of 24/-, devastating critical, a ton of life, lots and lots of cleric buffs (especially spell resistance), empowered healing spells, and yet another boost to DR from the war domain ability. And he fits in an RP perspective too (if you follow the whole clanfather thing)! Any suggestions are appreciated, but this dwarf's feats are so carefully balanced that changing much would limit his selection (either in the DR or the critical department). Help is good though!<br><br>Hope you like it.<br>_________________<br>CoolRMM<br>"You can do anything you set your mind to when you have vision, determination, and an endless supply of expendable labor."<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 10/12/07 19:58</span></i></p>
