Naturally people are very free to alter this as they see fit..AND I would not have it such all the time I was levelling, especially pre-epic where lower level buffing spells will come in handy...AND especially as this is a PvP focussed spellbook.<br><br>MY general tactics are to summon a large cloud of Darkness (2-3 castings), hide in it and dispell anyone who comes near. Mords should strip most of peoples buffs so when they hit the darkness the lose their vision. You then have disabling spells like your Dominates, Sunburst &amp; Bigbies to disable the enemies*...any teammates can then pick them off!<br><br>*Dominates for low Will builds such as WMs, Sunbursts for low reflex builds such as Strength Tanks, Bigbies for all your Dexxers<br><br>...plus once you Mords Negative Energy Protection away<br>your Negative Energy Bursts will do 9 Points of Str damage to make your Bigby's more sucessful!<br><br>vs. other Mages, Mords then counter &amp; let teammates bash away whilst you nullify them.<br><br>vs. Clerics, Mords then counter. With 38 caster levels you will strip pretty much ALL lowish level Cleric buffs and with LSB, GSB &amp; Mords you'll be able to counter all healing spells easily<br><br>Failing team support you can always enter Spam mode dropping 3d6+14d6 Icestorms, 9x4d6 Flame Arrows and of course 20x2d6 Isaac's Greater Missile Storms of your foes!<br><br>With respect to other Sorc. builds:<br><br>38 Sorcerer / 1 Paladin / 1 x<br><br>x - a lot of people like to take a tumble class here (Rogue for UMD, Monk for Wis Bonus &amp; Discipline...even Assassin).<br><br>However there are advantages to taking Ranger levels as well.<br><br>1) Using the Ranger bonus feat you gain an additional FREE feat best taken as Improved Combat Casting<br><br>2) Discipline. You get to max. Discipline at level 40, this means you can take your Paladin level as early as lvl 17 to take ESF: Discipline givin Charisma Saving throw bonus early AND +2 to Fort save / -1 to Will save<br><br>With regards to the fact that you are not going to have AC: AC is very much a secondary consideration. You are never really going to have a particularly high AC as a mage anyway, and any steps you do take to give you AC will decrease from your casting ability!<br><br>I hope I haven't missed anything!

Considering this theme, i'd put those remaining skill points to animal empathy on final skill dump.

If True seeing were nerfed, I'd take SD instead of Ranger.  That's one weak, clumsy, foolish sorcerer, but an effective one.  I would drop the CON to 15 and Raise INT to 14, then take maximize spell in place of the concentration skill focus and take a great CON in epic.  You basically gain 43 skill points for 3 points of concentration.  It would also let you take the expertise feats, for the loss of two other feats.  Just a couple of thoughts.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 08/17/06 08:25</span></i></p>

To take SD instead of Ranger you lose 3 feats, 2 to take Dodge &amp; Mobility &amp; 1 for the lack of the bonus free Ranger feat...<br><br>Taking expertise I would see as a waste as well as AC is really a secondary consideration, if you get ganked by a gang of Str tanks you ARE going to die! +5 to AC and not being able to cast does not really help. You are better off G.Sancing and escaping!

By spamming HiPS you can keep enemy casters from targeting you with spells (you can hide faster than they can spot), and you can relocate against melee builds.  Otherwise I agree that Ranger is a fine choice.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Taking expertise I would see as a waste as well as AC is really a secondary consideration, if you get ganked by a gang of Str tanks you ARE going to die! +5 to AC and not being able to cast does not really help.

In some settings you can still cast in expertise mode, there is a switch in the spell hook that determines whether you can or can't (the default is that you can).  So expertise and improved expertise can still be useful (+10 to AC while casting).  It might also be worthwhile to have epic warding if you're worried about getting hit (you could drop the skill focus in concentration and take maximize pre-epic) that way you could use damage shields to great effect.  Without epic warding the damage shields are a little worthless, since an opponent would likely kill you before the shields got them (none of the other DR spells work against +5 weapons).<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 08/18/06 04:31</span></i></p>
