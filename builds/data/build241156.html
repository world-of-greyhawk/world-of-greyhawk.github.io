<b>Playable from levels 1 to 40... PvM</b><br><br>This is my first and only attempt at a shifter.  I don't really care for the class, with the exception of the dragon and rashaka forms none of the forms are really powerful.  I didn't want to focus on single shape, as it kind of defeats the purpose of being a shifter and, with the exception of the forms I mentioned, you can make a better build with other classes to match the other forms.  Thus, I decided to focus on two shapes, the Kobold commando for melee purposes (it is one of the better melee forms) and the Rashaka form to combat casters.  As both of these forms don't override constitution I decided to increase that attribute as well.  The end result works okay, it's pretty strong in kobold form and confounds casters as a rashaka. It should do okay in no magic to low magic settings.  <br><br>If you wanted to, you could switch to dwarf. You could increase your STR to 14 and raise your CON to 17, which would free an epic feat, and make the build a bit more playable at lower levels at the cost of 43 skill points and a pre-epic feat.<br><br>While working on it I did get the idea that a druid 29/shifter 10/shadowdancer 1, that focused on the Rashaka form abusing HiPs and the Rashaka spells could be an effective build (and one which hasn't been posted), but I have no interest in working it out.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-Good HP.  With 632 hitpoints he can take a pounding<br>-9 points of damage reduction.  This can be very useful in a no or low-magic setting<br>-Good Saving Throws.  Unshifted his reflex save is not great, but it is fine when shifted.<br>-Outsider Shape.  He can turn into a rashaka against wizards and sorcs.<br>-4 attacks per round.  <br>-Okay melee AB while shifted.  In Kobold Commando form he has an AB of 44 which is okay in a no or low-magic setting.<br>-Improved Knockdown and Called Shot.  In Kobold Commando form he can spam IKD for sneak attacks and use a couple of called shot legs to weaken his opponents.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br><br>-Weak offense while in rashaka form.  He can't do much damage with his spells and his AB isn't great.<br>-Weak spell casting.  With only 5 druid levels he can only cast level 3 spells.<br>-Low AC.  With the hit points and DR this isn't too much of a problem in a low or no magic setting.<br><br><b>Stoneskin Skindancer</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Human<br><br><i>Alignment</i> NG, LN, TN, CN or NE<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 12<br>DEX 8<br>CON 16 <br>INT 14<br>WIS 16<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 40 increase Constitution<br>Levels 24, 28, 32 and 36 increase Wisdom<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Druid 5<br>Fighter 16<br>Shifter 19<br><br><i>Level Distribution and Feats</i><br>Level 1: (Druid 1): Alertness, Toughness<br>Level 2: (Fighter 1): Weapon Focus (Short Sword)<br>Level 3: (Fighter 2): Knockdown, Called Shot<br>Level 4: (Fighter 3)<br>Level 5: (Fighter 4): Weapon Specialization (Short Sword)<br>Level 6: (Druid 2): Zen Archery<br>Level 7: (Fighter 5)<br>Level 8: (Fighter 6): Improved Knockdown<br>Level 9: (Druid 3): Great Fortitude<br>Level 10: (Fighter 7)<br>Level 11: (Fighter 8 ) : Improved Critical (Short Sword)<br>Level 12: (Druid 4): Iron Will<br>Level 13: (Fighter 9)<br>Level 14: (Fighter 10): Expertise<br>Level 15: (Druid 5): Blind-Fight<br>Level 16: (Shifter 1)<br>Level 17: (Shifter 2)<br>Level 18: (Fighter 11): Improved Expertise<br>Level 19: (Shifter 3)<br>Level 20: (Shifter 4)<br>Level 21: (Fighter 12): Epic Weapon Focus (Short Sword), Epic Weapon Specialization (Short Sword)<br>Level 22: (Shifter 5)<br>Level 23: (Shifter 6)<br>Level 24: (Shifter 7): Epic Damage Reduction I<br>Level 25: (Shifter 8 ) <br>Level 26: (Fighter 13)<br>Level 27: (Fighter 14): Epic Prowess, Epic Damage Reduction II<br>Level 28: (Shifter 9) <br>Level 29: (Shifter 10)<br>Level 30: (Shifter 11): Great Wisdom I<br>Level 31: (Shifter 12)<br>Level 32: (Shifter 13): Great Wisdom II<br>Level 33: (Shifter 14): Great Wisdom III<br>Level 34: (Shifter 15)<br>Level 35: (Fighter 15)<br>Level 36: (Shifter 16): Great Wisdom IV, Great Wisdom V<br>Level 37: (Shifter 17)<br>Level 38: (Shifter 18)<br>Level 39: (Shifter 19): Epic Damage Reduction III, Outsider Shape<br>Level 40: (Fighter 16): Armor Skin<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 12<br>DEX 8<br>CON 22 <br>INT 14<br>WIS 25<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>AB and Damage</i><br>(no buffs, mundane shortsword)<br>32/27/22/17 7+1D6 (17-20 x2)<br><br>(no buffs, mundane composite longbow)<br>34/29/24/19 1+1D8 (20 x3)<br><br><i>AC</i><br>15 (no buffs no equipment)<br>26 (Full Plate, Tower Shield)<br>52  (+4 to DEX, +5 Full Plate, +5 Tower Shield, +5 amulet of natural armor, +5 ring of protection, Boots of Speed)<br><br><i>Final Saves (Vs.

Interesting shifter build... I agree that shifters get a lot less attractive as magic gets more prolific in the environment, but I do think they are pretty fun and unique for all that.  Not the most powerful build, but still looks like it could be fun to play.<br><br>Don't sell your gargoyle shape short, the epic gargoyle shape at shifter level 11 has DR 25/+7 - pretty significant even in medium-high magic worlds.  That should work with your EDR 3 and soak up to 34 damage per hit from most attackers.  Not shabby at all.  Since it doesn't look very practical to fit undead shape into your build for the risen lord, I'd probably hotbar the gargoyle shape to "turtle up" in when I need some breathing space to drink potions or use heal kits.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

I don't think +5 plate stacks with +5 ring of prot while shifted, since "everything" becomes deflection bonus.
