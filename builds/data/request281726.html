Hello there! <br>That's my first post and I'm not that good with english, so be patient, please <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif"> <br>So, back to the post: I had played almost every kind of build, being it a Uber build, or a build full of synergies, or a versatile one...and so on.<br>But now what I'm looking for is a build that is just FUN: it doesn't have to excel in nothing but beeing fun to play with.<br>I know that 'fun' sounds a bit vague. I'll try to explain what is fun, for me:<br><br><br>-playability range like 5-40 is fun..<br>-huge damage, althought from random calculation, is fun <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br>-spending 15 minutes just for killing mobs is not fun.. <br>-magic is fun..<br>-stealth is also fun <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  ..<br>-spending 20 minutes casting SHORT term buffs is not that fun..<br>-versatility is fun. Having different ways to kill an enemy is very fun..<br>-two weapons fight is fun <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  ..<br>-having to rest after few fights is not that fun..<br>-being able to solo effectively is fun..<br>-no alignment shift is fun..<br>-roleplay builds are fun..<br><br>…and so on. I think this is quite the same for other builders. If not, doesn’t matter. I wish to know the build you had the most fun with that meets some of my ideas of “fun”.<br><br>Thank you guys! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">

Bard/FTR. Maybe a few levels of RDD tossed in. But anything with lots of Bard. Good fun.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I suggest loadin up the PRC and comin to the mountain to play!   Nothin like a cleric/heirophant/hospitaler to do everything!  Imagine dev crit with a dc of 47!  Lv 9 divine spells with implosion dc of 47!  Lv 40 caster level!  OH,  and with the PRC spell list, you get Living Undeath..  or what i call, "pocket Palemaster"!  <br><br>The only down side is it takes 2 million hours to cast those 5 long term buffs after rest and with haste, it takes you a whole partial round to cast divine favor!<br><br>Its a pitty you hate clerics...  this is truly the most versatile build I have EVER seen.  But have fun playin those pure fighter builds.  THere is NOTHING more FUN than getting a feat every 2 levels!<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

And what about THE build you guys had the most fun playing with? I'm appreciating the suggestion you all are writing <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br>...but what about the build that made you play for hours and hours without rest and then saying...wow, what time is it?<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

For me it was (and still is) a STR-based Bard 16/FTR 4 (at level 20). First 4 levels in epic are Bard to get Lasting Inspiration at level 24. After that, I may grab 2 to 4 levels of RDD, a couple FTR levels, or more Bard, depending on my mood and the environment. I usually don't take Weapon Focus feats, but instead take Exotic Weapons so I can use anything I find. With his Bard Song/Curse Song, Spells, and ability to use anything he finds, it's a blast. I've played this build or a variant of it more than any other.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Stealth: Anything with SD at level 8. <br><br>Str-based: Monk/Fighter/CoT is fun - you hit like crazy, go through mobs very quickly, and move very quickly. After playing a monk, it takes me a while to get used to other classes - even with haste I feel like they are moving and hitting too slowly.<br><br>Magic - Any near-pure Sorc or Wiz build. I have to admit, these are the most fun for level 5-20 - every level up, you are gaining spells that make a huge difference in your power. After level 20, they don't change much - damage goes up a bit, but you don't really have the same feeling of improvement as in the early levels.<br><br>Melee builds are the opposite - they generally aren't gaining a tremendous amount of power in the early levels, then in Epic they start picking up things like EWS, Dev Crit, and pumping Str with feats.<br><br>TM
