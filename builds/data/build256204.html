A couple thoughts...<br><br>You might want to consider going with more cleric (say 9, or better yet 11 cleric levels) to get divine power and enough buff magic to bring your AB up a bit.  Take those extra levels away from COT epic levels and you should see a decent increase in power.<br><br>Thundering Rage and Overwhelming Crit don't stack... basically it's probably not worth it to take Thundering Rage in a build with O Crit.  I don't remember how it works, just that it doesn't work the way that you'd expect and is pretty disappointing.<br><br>If I were going to build this, I'd honestly ditch the charisma angle, but even if I was married to it I'd drop divine might.  You need to save your turning attempts for divine shield with the weak AC in this build.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
