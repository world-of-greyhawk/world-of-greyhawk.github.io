Here is a character build I have been mulling over and this is probably the optimal for him. A number of people have helped with this so if you recognize this build you know who you are.<br><br>Fighter 8/Champion of Torm 10/Weapon Master 22<br>Major Feats: Devastating Critical &amp; Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br><br>Race: Human<br>Class: Fighter<br>Alignment: Any non-evil<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>16 STR<br>15 DEX<br>14 CON<br>14 INT<br>8 WIS<br>8 CHA<br><br>Starting Skills:<br>4 Heal<br>4 Discipline<br>2 Intimidate<br>2 Spellcraft<br>2 Tumble<br><br>Starting feats:<br>Exotic Proficiency<br>Weapon Focus (bastard sword)<br>Dodge<br><br>Lvls/Feats/Abilities:<br>2 F Mobility<br>3 F Expertise<br>4 F spring attack/STR +1<br>5 F<br>6 F Whirlwind Atk, Power Atk<br>7 WM<br>8 CoT STR +1<br>9 CoT Cleave, Imp.

Also, he has a fair bonus to his saving throws from CoT levels at a cost of +2AB if 6 lvls were put into WM instead. HP will be around 500 without yet using +CON items. Those should bring HP even higher.<br><br>Foreseeable problems are against undead and critical immunes.<br><br>Feel free to take a few feats away from Gr STR and place them in other feats you wish to put in, just do it in multiples of 2, and only after you get Devastating Crit.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/10/07 14:18</span></i></p>
