I would drop exotic weaps, and take 2 more WM levels pre-epic instead of fighter. I think you would better off with the larger crit range than with the +1 average base damage. <br><br>I would also lean towards dropping the EDR feats, and pumping Str instead of Con. If you do that, you can even leave the katana choice and still fit the extra 2 WM levels.<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 04/13/06 18:43</span></i></p>

It's a very big jump of CON to take EDR, even though I like it a lot, like TM said, dropping it might be a good idea. The problem with EDR is that a Weapon Master needs DEX 13 and INT 13, plus all those feats, since you're taking Cleric levels you don't get enough feats to go with a dwarf to change CHA for CON, so dropping EDR will give you what, 7 STR and 3 epic feats?

I'd shuffle feats around to get empower spell instead of WP: exotic, focus on battleaxe or warhammer, go for 7 WM lvls as has been suggested, swap Greater ruin for another great WIS, start with 15 STR, 14 CON and pump STR. With the 3 EDR feats I'd grab two great STR and toughness. Final STR 24, WIS 20, CON 14.<br><br>With War domain instead of Magic, you can almost cap your physical stats with AoV and empowered Bull's Str/Endurance/Cat's Grace and actually cap CON and DEX with battle mastery for a handful rounds.<br><br>Cleric/WMs are nasty <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> <br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

I posted a Cleric 23 / WM 7 / CoT 10 a while back under Well Rounded Battle Cleric - that character used a Scythe, because the flat +2 to threat range from WM is too good a combo to pass up with a x4 crit weapon (x5 for WM). Granted, for that character, because you lack martial weapons prior to CoT but require weapon focus to qualify for it, exotic was a match made in heaven, but I still think any WM should definitely consider the scythe as a weapon of choice, and doubly so for Cleric / WMs who have all sorts of tasty damage bonuses to run through the quintupling engine.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By SonsofNorthWind on 04/16/06 00:44</span></i></p>

Valid point if you take Exotic and WM, go all the way with a scythe, which, in my opinion, is the weapon that gains most benefit attaining the X5, also great combined with Overwhelming Critical, it adds a lot. But he's taking a one-handed weapon, a shield is valuable too, the point I would get to, or maybe you too would get to, is that a katana doesn't excels the Exotic feat like a scythe does, there are other one-handed weapons that work almost the same, but a X5 scythe has no equal, Exotic for a katana is still much better than taking Martial, so there isn't any real loss, you can change the weapon to adapt it if you want to use his build though.

Style issues apart, I'm no big fan of katana (or bastard sword for the matter) it does a mere +1 dmg compared to longsword and has the same crit range.

It might even be worth concidering cleric 29 /fighter 4/wm 7, the same amount of feats, 8 hp less but four more caster levels. Could possibly be usefull..

I just realized how badly I murdered the comma in my last post... yikes. <br><br>Thax - I think there's definitely a place for stick and board builds - most notably, with Dev Crit using a scimitar or rapier, for Blackguards with high SA, for Smiters, and for spellswords.
