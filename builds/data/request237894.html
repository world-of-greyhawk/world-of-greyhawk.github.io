I'm wanting to make an odd build with the highest resistance possible, it obviously sacrifices damage and all, but as party based it could still work pretty well as a human shield, not aiming for playability nor even the fact that he won't kill anything, you could say it's for RP reasons.<br><br>In terms of defense, I would consider AC, DR, SR and HP as the main factors, so I focus on SR and go from there to increase AC as much as possible, this is what I've made (I'm not verifying numbers, this is what I remember):<br><br>Monk 38 / Fighter 1 / Dwarven Defender 1<br><br>Monk 38 gives +1 AC (and the SR), that's why I didn't take another Fighter level, the Fighter level was to take Armor Skin, Dwarven Defender is for Defensive Awareness I, so DEX is covered.<br><br>STR 10<br>DEX 16 (26)<br>CON 16<br>WIS 14<br>INT 14<br>CHA 6<br><br>All stat increases on DEX<br><br>1 Monk - Toughness<br>2 Monk<br>3 Monk - Dodge<br>4 Monk<br>5 Monk<br>6 Monk - Weapon Finesse*<br>7 Monk<br>8 Monk<br>9 Monk - Expertise<br>10 Dwarven Defender<br>11 Monk<br>12 Monk - Improved Expertise<br>13 Monk<br>14 Monk<br>15 Monk - Energy Resistance*<br>16 Monk<br>17 Monk<br>18 Monk - Energy Resistance*<br>19 Monk<br>20 Monk<br>21 Monk - Improves Spell Resistance I<br>22 Fighter - Armor Skin<br>23 Monk<br>24 Monk - ISR II<br>25 Monk<br>26 Monk<br>27 Monk - ISR III; ISR IV<br>28 Monk<br>29 Monk<br>30 Monk - ISR V<br>31 Monk<br>32 Monk - ISR VI<br>33 Monk - ISR VII<br>34 Monk<br>35 Monk<br>36 Monk - ISR VIII<br>37 Monk - ISR IX<br>38 Monk<br>39 Monk - ISR X<br>40 Monk<br><br>*Feats where I don't really know what to put, I'm only interested in defense.<br><br>Skills<br>Discipline 43<br>Tumble 40<br>Concentration 43<br>Listen 43<br>39 more points... if my count is correct<br><br>SR 68<br>AC 37<br>AB +38<br>HP 486<br><br>My first problem is that I think I'm taking too much SR, how much is enough so that spells don't hit me?

I'd take WF: Longbow and Luck of Heroes perhaps and drop the Energy Resistances. Might consider SF: Discipline for PvP environments.<br><br>You have 1 point extra SR, as 67 is definitely enough.

Note that monk bonus feats and AC come on multiples of 5, so you could drop 1 monk level for Fighter to pick up a feat and still have 67 SR. Or you could drop DwD for 2 levels of SD to pick up Uncany Dodge and HiPS (if you would like to use stealth as part of your defensive abilities).<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 04/20/06 17:30</span></i></p>

I've seen the other SR builds, they seem to base on beating casters while I'm basing on pure defense against everything, other SR builds lack the "Uncanny DEX" or in this case, Defensive Awareness for AC boost, I couldn't get to Defensive Awareness II though, for the non-flank stuff, since that needs 5 levels leaving SR in 65.<br><br>Longbows are for speed runners, as a shield build I'm supposed to be at the front. This build is 100% party based, get ranged and casters behind me, as I can take all the damage, but can't deal it, at least in PvM enemies won't be as smart as to avoid useless attack on me and attack my comrades. PvP wouldn't work at all.<br><br>Well, practically any AB will be bad considering I'll use Improved Expertise. I really don't care much about AB and damage, I told you it is an odd build, for fun rather than playability.<br><br>SF Discipline might be a good idea.<br><br>After AC and SR, what good is on saves? I think Luck of Heroes is wasted.<br><br>EDIT: TM I was posting when you replied, so couldn't see it.<br><br>Weird, I made the build and I am positive AC increased at Monk level 38...... need to re-check.<br><br>No Hide at all, I want to defend comrades, not so much myself, that's why I took Dwarven Defender.<br><br>Still, what feat to take with Fighter level 2, Epic Toughness?<br><br>EDIT 2: AC counted, 7 bonus, you're right TM, multiples of 5, so, changing for Monk 37 / Fighter 2 / Dwarven Defender 1<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 04/20/06 17:39</span></i></p>

You will never have enough defense against "everything", the attempt is doomed to fail. Instead, focus on one aspect and you may succeed.<br><br>That said, I don't see how dropping from Monk 38 to 37 lowers AC?

One other suggestion:<br>You are completely protected against magic, but still rather vulnerable to physical attack. Getting Epic Dodge would help a lot with that. You might want to consider dropping both Fighter and DwD for SD, and taking 5 levels. <br><br>This will lower your SR to 65, so a pure level 40 sorc or wiz with Epic Spell Pen will have a 10% chance of affecting you (but a level 38 one or level 40 with only Greater Spell Pen will not, so most won't be able to). But you will gain Epic Dodge, which will help a lot against physical attacks. You could also change race to Halfling, to pick up 2 more Dex and small stature, making your AC 2 higher (you don't care about unarmed damage anyway....). And HiPS would be very useful for when you want to heal - use HiPS, step back, and chug a heal potion or use a kit without taking AoO's. Then drop out of stealth mode and start taking attacks again.<br><br>TM

Yeah, Epic Dodge wouldn't hurt. I'm not sure about the HiPSing tactic, however, because if he's supposed to tank for his buddies, HiPSing away from combat all of the sudden allows them baddies to reach the mages and whatnot you're supposed to be tanking for, <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>"And one calculates <i>time</i> from the <i>dies nefastus</i> on which this fatality arose – from the <i>first</i> day of Christianity! – <i>Why not rather from its last?</i> – <i>From today?</i> – Revaluation of all values!"<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 04/20/06 18:29</span></i></p>

Well, if he doesn't HiPS and dies, he won't be a very effective tank either...<br><br>Using HiPS for 1 round to chug a potion of Heal, then attacking to get their attention again should be a better defense than laying on the ground dead.<br><br>TM
