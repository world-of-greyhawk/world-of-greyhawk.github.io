Is taking all the fighter levels right off maximize this build, I was under the impression you wanted to spread them out to maximize feats and such?

Yeah, he said it's not maximized, and without being really mean, I'd guess this build had no replies because there isn't anything to it, it's too plain and simple. Not that it's a bad build to play though...<br><br>The post is from 2004 by the way, so don't expect any reply from the author.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

The thing with this build is, its a 10/30 build.  Preepic you MUST have 10 prc and 10 non-prc (not exactly true, but for you, where the pw limits you to only 1 prc in a build, it works), so he has no other options with the 10 ftr lvls. Also, fighter and defender are pretty much the same, skill wise, so this actually IS maximized in that respect.  The reason rogu would be a HUGE asset to this build would be tumble and UMD, skills, in which case you would want to mix rog in at particular points in the build.  When you have classes with similar skill sets, it really makes no difference at all to the build.  hmm... thax and i should write a book on nwn building.  WAIT!  Isnt that what Anuis originally had in mind for this forum?
