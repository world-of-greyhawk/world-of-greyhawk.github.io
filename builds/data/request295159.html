I am looking to make something completely original on the server I play, It's a medium-high magic server and as most of the players use the Bard/RDD and the exaulted mages, so I was wondering whether a druid/PM would work.<br><br>I would like as many druid and PM lvls as possible with as few wiz levels as I can.  I looked on Pulse Cap and saw Puff the magic dragon, but it had too many wiz levels for my liking.  <br><br>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. thanks in advance

Anyways, this is the build I would suggest as well. Should be original on your server and a nice surprise for people to run into.

Druid / Pale Master is not a common build, you can surprise people easily, but in fact it isn't all that powerful as it might sound, yeah Pale Master gives you critical immunity but that's about it, you were already immune to sneaks while shifted and unless you take more PM to take Arcane Epic Spells, the rest of the PM levels are just low hit dice and a bit of AC (but druids usually take Monk which gives even more AC) while it's a considerable amount of levels where you don't get penetration on your divine spells.<br><br>Depending on your environment, it could be worth it to spend a bit more Pale Master for Epic Mage Armor or Epic Warding, since they're very powerful spells Druid can't access, though you would lose even more penetration...<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

I did look at the Dracolich, but assumed (wrongly) that the DC would be increased rather than decreased.<br><br>I'll give this build a try on the server I play and I thank you for your expert advise.<br><br>As a footnote, what advantages do the Dracolich build over, say, A druid/wiz/PM build?
