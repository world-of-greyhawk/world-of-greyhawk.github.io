You need Expertise to qualify for Whirlwind Attack.<br><br>And I wouldn't bother with this class combo at all, especially like that. If you really wanted a Sorc/WM, didn't you think of using fighter to help qualify at all???! It's unfocussed and the WM levels do not suddenly grant you super AB as they'd usually do. You neglected to fill in the ending stats. Posting those is a requirement here for a build - otherwise post it in the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewforum.html", "8061", "16203", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Build Request Forum which also doubles as a place for fleshing out concept build</a>. Nor would I bother with the Two Weapon Fighting feats so late in life. You're adding stats all over the place and I'm not sure if this guy can even cast 9th level spells by the end (final CHA?) and you took 21 levels of Sorc and you won't get any metamagic feats at all. Not to mention crappy HP when WM HP is usually low.<br><br>HINT: have an aim in mind when you build. Aimless building = lotsa trash. And please do state that aim when introducing your build.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

I agree with Jenna but for the expertise thing; he actually took it at first level <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

Jennalee your comments are most welcome, thank you<br>Restrictions on the server ment only Sorc lvls for that legacy PrC ment something on this server, ending stats were mistake<br>21 sorc for epic spell dragon knight, have extend from 6. While it remains fairly scattered i found it played easy enough.<br>I should as you said put a reason/aim on these chars but yeh learning ropes on how to post here. Also for the fighter thing i rather the classes werent changed, but a improvement within that build.<br>This build is built on RP while it really was the worse melee i ever played the experince was good

Taking fighter levels pre-epic will probably get your AB higher than 19 levels of WM and get you much needed feats - allowing you to take WM earlier, and allow you to take more metamagic ones. If your basic concept is a spellsword, it won't really change that build concept - it will improve on it. You can't really do too much to improve on it with those  classes only.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

I'd agree on taking some fighter-type class levels before 20 to improve your attack abilities.  <br>Am not too well versed on WM, but I think the benefits are limited to +2ab for the 6 wm levels<br><br>Here's something I thought of, it's not checked by any means but just the kind of thing you could do:<br>The Chaotic Caster:<br>Barbarian5/Sorc22/WM13!! <br>[Barbarian gets uncanny dodge - keep that dex bonus!!; and also gets intimidate as a class skill, plus fighter attack progression, decent weapon selection.. um, I'll stop the list now <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  ]<br><br>Race HUMAN <br>Alignment Chaotic Neutral<br>S10<br>Dex16<br>Con10<br>Int14<br>Wis8<br>CHA16<br>SKILLS:<br>At lvl1 Max Intimidate (4).

Funny thing: I thought I beat jenna to the punch, but I'm seein that I guess I didnt click submit after all!  Oh well, she beat me to it.<br><br>The thing I am wondering (and, keep in mind Im all for nifty class combos), what is the point of a sorc/wm?  There are absolutely no synergies between these 2 classes.  In fact, they seem to be the farthest UNRELATED classes you can find (even blackquard and paladin share their common love of smiting).  The thing is, you hamper your sorc by taking the qualifyin for wm, and wm gets nothin much from sorc lvls.  The only way I can see this is if you had more ab, WHICH can happen if you took extend spell after wm.  This way you may hit the 16 ab required to have a semi-decent meleeist.  The downside is that sorc doesnt give much to a melee char.  <br><br>If you see it differently, please enlighten me!   To do a melee sorc, paladin brings a TON more to it.  NOw pal/sorc/wm would be something...   But its hard to pass up rdd when you make a sorc/pal<br><br>just my 2 cents<br><br>Peace

Khandahr your post is appricated but i do not want to stray from the 2 classes used<br>Avado its simple the legacy(skin i suppose you would say) allows only sorc/wm, apart from not being able to multiclass anymore a pally would not suit the the faction. As you said there is little poiny to mix them together but when forced like so(i quite enjoyed playing it even being so weak), i just want to see how others would of approaced such build. Getting to epic on this server is no easy feat so taking extend early was better i had given thought to RDD but that required more than being able to get the prereqs and clicking on class<br>Thank you
