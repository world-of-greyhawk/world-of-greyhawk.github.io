just a note: low ab is always ALWAYS low ab.  If you are making a tank then you want to have good ab.  34 is pitiful with no div pwrs or favs about.  <br><br>See, I one time thought it is ok where +20 ab from itms meant i could chinz on ab, but i soon learned that my thinking was flawed.  If I, with a pitiful ab of 34 can add 20, I would have 54!  WOOT!  Then ALL of my fellow tanks would also have the +20!   If im a builder, I have designed the pw for this type of meleer.  Short, my low ab will always be too low for the server.  Quite honestly, if the pw you play allows you to be a melee tank with this type of ab, then its time to look for a new more challenging server <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">    Just my 2 cents from the trenches.<br><br>Peace<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

(60/55/50 with +20 and +12 STR items / buffs ) I don't think 60 ab buffed is so bad. I do also have access to Divine Power scrolls. This build is tailored to my world, as mentioned if you want ab then you can change this build to be based around STR rather than CON, while still keeping the epic damage reduction feats. Oh and you also seem to assume I have to be "uber" on my own? I play with a team and I fill in my role in that team.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Akimb0 on 11/03/06 11:55</span></i></p>

IMO, tanks don't have to be that big of a threat.  It's a perfectly acceptable party role to distract the enemy from the real damage dealers, the rogues and the arcane casters, although you must remember that tanks do need to be scary enough that someone will go after them instead of after the soft squishies you are trying to defend.  Because of this, I will have to agree a 34 AB is a bit low for most applications.<br><br>A base 21 or 22 constitution to qualify for EDR will give you enough hit points to let you last through most any battle that is decided on endurance.  Beyond that, as a general rule, you're better off increasing offensive output.<br><br>Back to the low AB, a scimitar is probably a poor choice, because you won't be able to take advantage of the threat range (no critical hits when you only hit on a 20).  Use a warhammer or even *gasp* gain a feat by using a simple weapon.  They really aren't that bad, and they look cool.<br><br>Why PM 19?  3 more Bard levels gets you more spells, a better song, more regular skill dumps in epic, and you only lose one feat, which you intended for an energy resist.  1 more PM and you get an extra 2 AC.<br><br>Also, purely from a mechanical point of view, if you take your odd PM level ups at intervals where an extra caster level won't gain new Bard spells, you won't lose out on any spells known.  You have room for 4 levels of PM pre-epic without losing any AB, so you should probably take advantage of that.  As you have the leveling order now, you have the spells known of a 10th level Bard, but you could easily have the spells known of a 13th or 14th level Bard without losing anything.<br>_________________<br>(I enjoy writing parenthetically (a lot)).
