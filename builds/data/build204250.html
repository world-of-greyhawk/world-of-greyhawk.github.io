<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM or PvP</b><br><i>truth to tell, though, it's much, much better after level 3 <br>(weapon finesse).</i><br><br>This is a rebuild of the Death by Dexterity build I posted a few days ago.  It is better by adding a level of monk for an added monk bonus to AC without losing any AB (because AA AB bonus falls on odd levels).  You get improved evasion about 17 levels sooner, which could be helpful.  You get ki strike now - you didn't before (not terribly useful but not useless).  I also ramped the constitution to 12 for the fortitude save bump and the 40 hitpoints at the expense of charisma, which while nice does nothing for anything on this build.  If you take toughness at level 18, you get pretty respectable hitpoints.  <br><br>Monk10/Wizard7/Arcane Archer23 – Elf <br>Any Lawful Alignment<br><br>Starting Stats:<br><br>S: 10<br>D: 18 to 36<br>C: 12<br>I: 14<br>W: 14<br>CH: 8<br><br> <br>1 ) Monk1: Point Blank Shot<br>2 ) Monk2 <br>3 ) Monk3: Weapon Finesse<br>4 ) Monk4 (DEX 19)<br>5 ) Monk5 <br>6 ) Monk 6: WF: Longbow<br>7 ) Monk7<br>8 ) Monk8 (DEX20)<br>9 ) Wizard1: Rapid Shot <br>10) AA1<br>11) AA2: <br>12) AA3 (DEX21) ImpCrit: Longbow<br>13) AA4<br>14) AA5 <br>15) AA6: Dodge<br>16) AA7 (DEX 22)<br>17) AA8 <br>18) AA9: Feat: Toughness or Mobility<br>19) AA10 <br>20) WIZ2 (DEX 23) <br>21) Monk9: GrDex I (DEX 24)<br>22) WIZ3<br>23) WIZ4 <br>24) WIZ5 Feat: GrDex II (25); WFeat: Craft Wand (DEX26)<br>25) AA 11<br>26) AA 12<br>27) AA13 Feat: GrDex III (27) <br>28) AA 14 AAFeat: GrDex IV (DEX28) (Dex 29)<br>29) AA15<br>30) AA 16 Feat: GrDex V (DEX30) <br>31) AA 17 <br>32) AA 18 AAFeat: GrDex VI (DEX31) (DEX 32) <br>33) AA 19 Feat: Epic Prowess<br>34) AA 20 <br>35) AA 21<br>36) AA 22 Feat: GrDex VII (DEX 33); AAFeat: Armor Skin (DEX 34) <br>37) Wiz6<br>38) Monk10<br>39) WIZ7 Feat: GrDex VIII (DEX 35)<br>40) AA 23 (DEX 36)<br> <br>AC 38 no armor; 42 with mage armor (10 + 2 monk + 13 dex + 2 wisdom + 1 dodge + 8 tumble +2 armor skin)<br><br>Melee AB (six attacks per round unarmed): 41/38/35/32/29/26 (26 base attack + 13 (dex through weapon finesse) +1 (epic prowess))<br>Melee AB with flurry of blows (7 attacks/round): 39/36/33/30/27/24/39 <br>Damage: 1d10<br><br>Longbow AB (4 attacks/round): 53/50/45/40 (26 base attack + 13 (dex) + 12 (enchant arrow XII) + 1 (wf: longbow) + 1 (epic prowess))<br>Longbow in rapid shot mode (5 attacks/round): 53/48/43/40/53 <br>Damage: (1d8+12) <br><br>Saves:	Fort 23 (31 v. spells)<br>	Ref: 36 (44 v. spells)<br>	Will: 24 (32 v. spells) (34 v. mind spells (still mind))<br><br>HP (no rerolls): 278 (+40 if elect toughness at level 18)<br><br>Skills: Discipline: 41<br>	Listen: 43<br>	Spellcraft: 40<br>	Tumble: 40<br>	Spot: 43<br>	Open Lock: 1 (14 with Dex bonus)<br>	Set Traps: 1 (14 with Dex bonus)<br>	Concentration: 35<br><br>Monk Special Abilities &amp; Feats<br>Level 1 	Cleave<br>		Evasion<br>		Flurry of Blows<br>		Improved Unarmed Strike	<br>		Monk AC Bonus<br>		Stunning Fist<br>Level 2 	Deflect Arrows<br>Level 3 	Monk Endurance (Speed 130%)and Still Mind (+2 will saves against mind spells)<br>Level 5 	Purity of Body (immune to disease)<br>Level 6 	Knockdown and Improved Knockdown<br>Level 7 	Wholeness of Body (lay on hands)<br>Level 9 	Improved Evasion<br>Level 10	Ki Strike (unarmed attack +1 for overcoming damage soak) <br><br>Spells (Craft Wands!):<br>1	True Strike<br>	Mage Armor<br>	Prot from Alignment <br>2	Cat's Grace<br>	Invisibility<br>3	Haste<br>	Clarity<br>4	Improved Invisibility<br>	Stoneskin<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 07/16/05 13:04</span></i></p>

ooooooh. i am supposed to tell you (thanks ghook) that it's playable from 1 to 40.  truth to tell, though, it's much, much better after level 3 (weapon finesse).

Very nice Build Ith!! I have wanted to try a monk archer and this is a good build and not just using the one token caster level to qualify for AA. I see this character playing tag running all over the place from monsters and shooting them from afar. They should never catch him with monk speed plus haste lol.<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick. Long ago I learned to strike swiftly and without scruple. I trouble no man without cause, but one who attacks me had best resolve himself to die!

the monk speed is most excellent for an archer.  the funny part is that it takes a while -- a gooooood while -- before the archer attack bonus overcomes the monk extra attack as an advantage.  i think but do not know (haven't calculated) that a monk 8 wiz 2 arcane archer 10 would be a better melee fighter (ab wise) than a monk 20.  which is weird.<br><br>let's see, 26 v. 26, nope they are the same, but the archer can cast (and scribe) spells such that it would own the monk.  <br><br>anyway, thanks!

AA does not provide SC as a bonus feat, so he could only take it on a general Levels 33, 36, 39.  Probably not a bad alternative since 30% Concealment (that is not dispellable) is a pretty nifty trick, and his AB really wouldn't suffer that much.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

If you assume that everything works in 5% increments (as I think you must in a d20 environment), you net 10% total (you got 5% worse on offense and 15% better on defense).  <br><br>You also have to trade some skill points to hide.  If I were making the mod, I would take them from listen, which has a lot of the advantages of spot.   <br><br>This build assumed invisibility and improved invisibility and so did not put much skill in hide or move silently.
