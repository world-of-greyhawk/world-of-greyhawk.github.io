I never really played around with bards before and I like the idea of party-wide bonuses through the bard song, and enemy penalties through curse song. I just don't know how else they could be used other than playing them like a more flamboyant rogue by making a bard's dexterity ability their primary. The problem is that the bard does not have sneak attack and cannot deal the same damage that rogues can, even though with Weapon Finesse they could hit with the same accuracy.<br><br>What's a good build plan for a bard? I have a bard entertainer/gambler/dashing hero concept in mind, but I don't want to multiclass.<br><br>I play on a server with a level cap of 30 and +4 items, and some subraces have ECL adjustments which reduce the level cap.  The subrace I was considering is a human subrace with +2 charisma, -1 strength, -1 constitution applied after creation, and is also given the Artist feat for free, but it does not have an ECL adjustment. The character would still get Quick to Master.

I believe I know the server you are speaking about. If it is so, the life of a Bard there is very very easy (lite-RP server with islands?). Before I quit I had a lvl 16 bard there, no multiclass, no subrace, AC 52, and enough AB to kill hordes of Beastmen since he was lvl 14 (before better Song). By the way he was based on STR, not DEX, and I believe most people on these boards will tell you that STR based Bards are better that DEX based in general. If I am right about the server, get your Bard some full plate, longsword and tower shield, leave CHA at 16, invest in Discipline, UMD, Perform and whatever else you want and have fun. You can get Lich Lyrics as early as you can kill said Beastman boss, and after that you have 3 Horrid Wiltings before you have to rest.<br><br>Also, it is always a good idea to check Pulse Cap's build search engine, even if it is not for lvl 30 builds you can get tons of ideas from the builds there.<br>_________________<br>Like Prometheus we are bound,<br>Chained to this rock of a brave new world,<br>Our godforsaken lot.

The thing about a strength-based bard with heavy arms and armor is that it really doesn't fit the theme I wanted.  Your build does sound interesting and I will think about trying it, but the heavy equipment still sounds more like a secular paladin than a lightly armed scoundrel.

True, it doesnt, I overlooked that part of your request, my bad <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   Still, you can surely go DEX based, use whatever weapon you want (if it is the server I spoke about) and purchase Summon Monster scrolls that will get you to lvl 25+ without a sweat. Gold is very very easy to get there, scrolls easy to find, etc. If I am wrong about the server, let me know and we try to get you some better pointers.<br><br>Cheers<br>_________________<br>It's fear of god that brought us to that state.<br>How fortunate the man with none.<br><br>Bertold Brecht

You have the right server.  I put role play before fighting, but I also want to have a decent build that can support the party without being a liability too.

There aren't any martial weapons that are finessable, so that feat isn't needed.  I do like the idea of getting Weapon Specialization, but then would that cut into bard song?

Yep, 26 Bard/4 Fighter is pretty solid. You can get 4 APR and WS or have 3 APR and EWS (17 Bard/3 Fighter pre-epic). If you don't care for the extra Epic Bonus Feat at Bard 26 you can get 4 APR and EWS with Bard 25/Fighter 5 and still only be Dispelable by Mord's. Rapier is a good choice there also as there are many Dev Critters that craft Rapiers with the Mythal system and some may be available for purchase in the stores in Cordor.<br><br>But... If you really want your parties to love you go Bard 30 all the way, investing all the levels in Perform and getting all the Perform-enhancement feats (Artist, Skill Focus, ESF) because with the Mythal system you can add up to +5 Perform in all or most your items and that will give you maximum Bard Song (requires 100 Perform). From the login screen (where you can see people's builds) I have never seen a pure lvl 30 Bard there, which will surely make your character unique and wanted (or so I would guess). Just invest in Discipline, Tumble, Perform and UMD and you are pretty much covered skill-wise. Other skills to suit your tastes (Spot being nice to prevent Pick Pocket, Spellcraft for saves against spells, and the Craft skills if you plan on using the Mythal system heavily yourself).<br><br>Hope this post was more helpful than the other one, and apologies for not posting a build.<br><br>Cheers and good luck with your Bard.<br><br>PS- If your character is ever to meet Dwagin's character (female tiefling that retired from Business after getting stinky rich) try and get her to modify your armor. Your Bard's vanity will definetly thank you, because that horned (not horny, you perverts) lass can surely craft some seriously good-looking armors.<br>_________________<br>Like Prometheus we are bound,<br>Chained to this rock of a brave new world,<br>Our godforsaken lot.

Well, I guess it is for the OP to decide, that was my suggestion. I would personally favor a character in my party that can give me +1 AC and + 4 to skills if I were still playing in the PvP heavy environment of the server we were talking about. AC and AB are never too much, Curse Song making it even easier for the WMs to Knockdown (-4 to Discipline) while Bard Song makes it harder for anyone to to KD the ones in said party (another +4 to Discipline).<br><br>That and the fact that I will shamelessly promote pure bards being it justifiable or not <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>It's fear of god that brought us to that state.<br>How fortunate the man with none.<br><br>Bertold Brecht

My 2 cents worth are absolutely not meant to be rude.<br><br>I would not have posted anything about pure builds ever but for two reasons mainly (in the Guild, not only this post), those being a specific thread dealing with them (I always thought the idea appealing, but was not sure they belonged here) and some time after a build posted by the veteran The_Krit (Combat Mistress, a pure build fighter without WS no less). I thought, hey, after all there are people who can surely powerbuild better than I can and are also interested in concepts in lieu of power at times. Also I understand (perhaps erroneously) that Epic Character Builds are any builds that take the character to epic levels and have any value at all, even if it is for fewer players than the whole of the guild. I would refrain from such posting and such suggestions should the name for the guild be Epic Multiclassed Powerbuilds.<br><br><br>More on topic, the suggestion for pure bard was based on my (limited, I confess) knowledge of the Amia server (where the OP plays) and its boards, where there is a thread that focuses on building characters for the server, and believe me, there is nothing but Powerbuilding and maximizing there. I assumed the OP had read their boards, and was not all happy with what they read, coming to the ECB in hopes to have the best fun he could get with his character, and trusting that someone here would give him ideas. If in doing so I am contributing to the death of NWN powerbuilding or offering ideas or posts that are contrary to what the Guild expects their forums to be, I can understand and decide on a course of action based on what moderators/owners tell me about the matter. I try (and fail at times, I am sure) not to infer too much on people's reasons.<br><br>Cheers<br>_________________<br>Like Prometheus we are bound,<br>Chained to this rock of a brave new world,<br>Our godforsaken lot.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By OCNT Dogo on 01/22/10 22:02</span></i></p>

The only reason i highlighted this secion is cuz it is so very different from why i became part of this guild.  I first asked Torias about building and he pointed me to Anuis' wonderful guild way back when.  I joined cuz i wanted to understand the game and what made me NOT die!  LOL  Simple enough goal.  Over the years, the ECB has had alot of non-power gamer builds posted (almost all my non-PRC builds would never be considered power builds if you look through the builders index), and yes, they were concepts to see if they could achieve an aim the builder had in mind.  And indeed there are LOTS of them!  I even remember a time where i thought it would be a neat idea to create a "name" character!  Like, what would AVADO be in a game?  LOL  Not a power build, i can assure you.  It took me several years to "get it" right for me.<br><br>Now, like Kail says, ALL builds are welcome here.  There may even be some pure builds around, who knows.  The thing is, a pure build really requires no planning.  With bard, you just need to know the reqs for Lasting Inspir or whatever and RUN!  It aint rocket science.  Now, ther REASON you multiclass has to do with ADDING to where the character is deficient.  Bards, esp dexers, require damage.  Adding 4 ftr lvls can net you EWS in your weapon of choice, which is equivalent to 12 additional str points for damage calculation.  Not to shabby on a low damage build. That would be a 26/4 split with a VERY solid bard song.  Would you need a 3rd?  Not with this skill set.  BUT, look at what a 22b/4ft/4rdd gets you!  You can add +4 str (+1 ac) which is +2 damage on top of it.  Yes, your bard song isnt as good, but you now can tank a bit. <br><br>Heck, you could even add 1-4 lvls or PM for an AC boost (seen that done with 1 lv)!  We arent talking HUGE changes, but still, they can make a difference vs a straight 30 or 40lvls of a class.<br><br>So dont get us wrong.  There is nothing inherantly wrong in a pure build.  The question is, why not take an idea and make it stronger?

A level 40 fighter built by me would trounce the level 40 fighters of many other players.

Mhe, powergaming was only an wannabe attempt before I entered this guild and learned from the pros. What I thought was a powerful building wasn't really near the big shots. I do believe this guild should be a place where the newcomers learn how building should be done, because a build well made is not necessarily a god of death but it takes smart choices to improve its abilities. When people don't want to do that, it seems they only want someone else to do the building in their place, so yeah, I agree with avado, Pure builds make no sense, but after telling people that pure builds are not intelligently built, there's nothing else I'd like to add, the rant usually goes on and on, drop it dude.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

I don't see what is so hard to understand why someone would want a single class epic build and ask for help on making that build the best it can be.

The eleven basic selections can approximate almost any character concept, and often several options are available."<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_class" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_class</a><br><br>"In role-playing games, a common method of arbitrating the capabilities of different characters is to assign each one to a character class. A character class aggregates several abilities and aptitudes, and may also sometimes detail aspects of background and social standing or impose behaviour restrictions. Classes may be considered to represent archetypes, or specific careers."<br><br>"There are also character classes that combine features of the classes listed above and are frequently called hybrid classes. Some examples include the Bard, a cross between the thief and mage with an emphasis on interpersonal skills, mental and visual spells, and supportive magical abilities - such as singing a positive stats-aiding song, or the Paladin, a cross between the fighter and cleric with slightly decreased combat skills but various innate abilities that are used to heal or protect allies and repel and/or smite evil opponents."<br><br>"Classes provide direction and limitations for characters. For example, a thief will usually be provided abilities such as lock picking, but probably would not be able to wield magic as well as a mage (or, depending on the game, possibly not at all). Game designers use the limitations provided by classes to encourage (or enforce) interdependence among characters."<br><br>"Some RPGs feature another variation on the classes mechanic. For example in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, players choose a career. The career works like a class with added bonuses or skills related to the selected career. However as the player advances and gains more experience he or she may choose a new career according to a predefined career path. A player might start as a warrior and choose a career path to become a mercenary or choose a different path to become a dragonslayer. The warrior's available career paths do not allow the player to become a mage, similar to the restriction that one cannot change classes."<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 01/23/10 19:12 (GMT) -- onioneater<br><br>You mean the self-destruct button?

Also, as long as I'm disagreeing with everyone...<br><br>I see no reason why one shouldn't ask for help in making a pure build, if one needs help, and this seems the perfect place to do so.  Yes, it is pretty simple, but if you don't know how, then ask.  One of the constants in NWN is the lack of constants.  Every environment is different, and there are often distinct parameters to be considered with building.  Often these parameters seem rather silly to me, but that's not the point.  If one really needs to build a DEX based fighter in a world that only allows single classed builds, well, then we'll see what we can do (which, in that case, wouldn't be much...).  It may be boring to Avado (and myself...), but that aint the point.  Guy wants a DEX based pure level 30 bard, then by golly, give the guy what he wants.

AND, no matter how good you think your build is, you can ALWAYS die by a mistake!<br><br>How do i know this?  I had the HONOR of logging one time to a server full (5 of 6) people making one of my builds.  Unfortunately, NONE had the ability to use it like i did (one even asked how and what Epic spells were!).  Yet, i camped that build in areas where people needed 4 to 5 people to survive with NO troubles EVER!  ITs all about play style.  <br><br>Like Thax says, there is no bad questions.  Some of us wish that they came with more thought though.  Thax and i spent many an hour pouring over build after build to learn the trade of nwn building (too bad it dont pay well).  We know what we like for OURSELVES.  That doesnt make it right FOR YOU!  Thax' advice is bang on and he has the amazing ability to GENERALIZE better than i can, but in the end, it will be your build so DO IT!  LOL  Have a blast.  You will make mistakes but so what?  We all did (i had an account with 25 builds that i started and changed my mind on).  HAVE FUN!  its a game afterall.<br><br>Here endeth the sermon....

Many PWs do have some multiclassing rules (though many do not, at least not really meaningful ones), for various reasons, but even the ones that are attempting to encourage pure builds seldom succeed.  The fact remains that NWN encourages multiclassing, and it certainly seems by design, not just an unintended consequence of rulemaking.

I just don't know how else they could be used other than playing them like a more flamboyant rogue by making a bard's dexterity ability their primary. The problem is that the bard does not have sneak attack and cannot deal the same damage that rogues can, even though with Weapon Finesse they could hit with the same accuracy.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->The damage dealing potential of the bard is nothing like the SA a rogue deals, or the mega buffs of the cleric. The song let you deal max +3 to damage and the curse song does some direct damage. The spells Magic weapon, GMW, Bulls, Keen edge, War cry, all can add to weapon damage and Haste adds another attack.  Wounding whispers adds reciprocal damage and there are a couple of direct damage spells like Ice storm and the lesser Sound burst. If you have access to lyrics of the lich, the song will work as a horrid wilting spell centred around your character.<br><br>Dont expect a dex based pure bard to be a heavy damage dealer.<br>Pure strength (as in a strength build) will to some degree help cure this. There are several multiclass options that also will help.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;What's a good build plan for a bard? I have a bard entertainer/gambler/dashing hero concept in mind</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Ok, you want to entertain, gamble and be a dashing hero.<br> <br>If RP is your focus, you can do most of that out of the engine by participating in and even initiate events where your character gets the lead role as an entertainer etc. You dont need a specific build for this though. You can RP an entertainer and storyteller with a lvl 1 character of any class, all you need is the avatar.<br><br>If the RP involves any skill check rolls to see if you succeed as a performer, you should add skillpoints to perform to (*sigh*) perform better. For that you will need bard levels.<br><br>If your idea of a dashing hero involves any kind of combat experience, one way to go about that is to create a support (read: leader) character that buffs other characters with spells, bard song, curse song and uses the taunt skill to weaken the enemies. You can do that wielding nothing but a lute (or electric guitar (or whatever)). In that case I recommend feats like curse song and lingering song, a high perform skill and taunt skill, and high enough charisma to be able to cast all the spells (cha=16).<br><br>If you plan on taking part in any direct enemy confrontation that involves wielding a weapon, bard is a strong choice. It is capable of doing reasonably well on its own as a single class. It has a good selection of class skills and buff spells that are geared towards combat and the song works double wonders when you add curse song.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;but I don't want to multiclass.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->I agree with the other posters above that the bard is a class you want to multiclass.

Some examples include the Bard, a cross between the thief and mage with an emphasis on interpersonal skills, mental and visual spells, and supportive magical abilities - such as singing a positive stats-aiding song, or the Paladin, a cross between the fighter and cleric with slightly decreased combat skills but various innate abilities that are used to heal or protect allies and repel and/or smite evil opponents."<br><br>"Classes provide direction and limitations for characters. For example, a thief will usually be provided abilities such as lock picking, but probably would not be able to wield magic as well as a mage (or, depending on the game, possibly not at all). Game designers use the limitations provided by classes to encourage (or enforce) interdependence among characters."<br><br>"Some RPGs feature another variation on the classes mechanic. For example in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, players choose a career. The career works like a class with added bonuses or skills related to the selected career. However as the player advances and gains more experience he or she may choose a new career according to a predefined career path. A player might start as a warrior and choose a career path to become a mercenary or choose a different path to become a dragonslayer. The warrior's available career paths do not allow the player to become a mage, similar to the restriction that one cannot change classes."</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --> Which is all meaningless since it's not DnD/NWN specific.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

One can concentrate on many aspects of straight up fighting (many ftr lvls) at the expenses of adaptability and additional non straight-up fighting techniques (rogue lvls); different lvls of balance between the two aspects can be reached with different results. Some combos will be, overall, more powerful. And there's nothing wrong with that.

As far as suggestions for pure bards go from my side: <br><br>Str 14<br>Dex 10<br>Con 14<br>Int 14<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 16<br><br>could be a good starting spread for a Str bard, possibly STR 15/Dex 8. Key features are Curse Song, Still Spell, Craft Wand, Lasting Inspiration and possibly, depending on gear available, Artist, SF: Perform and ESF: Perform. Good feats to select are BF, KD, WF/EWF, IC, EP, AS for combat prowess, Great Strength, Great Charisma and ESF feats.<br><br>Of course without powerful Perform gear available higher level song are just a pipe dream even with all the perform enhancing feats.<br><br>If suggestions for multiclassing are welcome, without cutting too much into bard levels and without making the character any less bardic I'd consider Bard 25/FTR 5 for enhanced combat prowess or Bard 20/FTR 6/BG 4 to achieve a powerful song (together with LI) within the character's reach, combat prowess and an extra help from divine feats. Undispellability is lost, but the build is pretty nice.<br><br>As a final consideration one can have a bard 30 that is no bard at all or a bard 0 which is the epitome of bardicness, if by bard we mean, to make it simple, a storyteller.
