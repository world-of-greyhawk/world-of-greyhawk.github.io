I would like to make this focus on ranged, obviously, and use magic to assist in traps for help fighting groups or tough enemies. I was thinking about Wizard 7/Rogue 17/AA 16.<br>Questions? Would SC be worth it in this build? Wizard 7 is for improved invisibility. Should I take extend spell? How much skill points are necessary for wizardry skills? Mostly I am after buffs, darkness and Evards black tentacles.<br>_________________<br>Entropy is a joule thief

Try using the <a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">Build Searcher</a>, you might like some of the builds that are already there. Personally, my Rogue/AA doesn't have enough Wizard for casting Improved Invisibility... Extended Spell is good, but you'll need another two levels to get the higher slots so that you can Extend.<br><br>Wizardry skills? pretty much just Concentration and Spellcraft, the deal are your Rogue skills, those are plenty.<br><br>Self Concealment is the last thing you want if you're looking to buff Improved Invisibility, since they don't stack. Self Concealment needs too high stats and too many feats for this build IMO, take Epic Dodge, but Self Concealment is too much.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Thanks for your advice. I have looked at the builds and it helps but they are not really what I am after. She will primarily be a rogue with wizard tricks and AA for boosting ranged attacks. But it might not be a bad idea to keep wizard levels low and and just use UMD. Every wizard level holds back AB which would require increased AA levels.<br>_________________<br>Entropy is a joule thief

So, what is it they lack to fit your tastes? being a primary Rogue with Wizard tricks and AA to boost AB is too vague to give any decent advice, since that actually describes most Rogue/AA builds.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Thanks, a nice build and one that could be fun at all levels.
