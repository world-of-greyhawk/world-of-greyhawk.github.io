It seems a little weaker than the other rogue/COTs you've done.</b><br>A:  Well, a rogue/cleric/COT is hard to beat for raw power, but this character benefits heavily from having a lot of skill points and an almost limitless skill selection.  He also picks up epic dodge and has a reasonably average unbuffed AB for a melee.<br><br>Bardsong is a nice benefit, and with the bard spells you have strong buffing and, possibly, some small healing ability (up to cure critical wounds if you want it).<br><br>As a dex build you haven't got to worry about arcane failure.  And you're a halfling of doom!<br><br><b>Q:  Why don't you get a higher dex?  And how come 8 strength?</b><br>A:  Not enough room in the build for more dex.  The strength is 8 because of the halfling penalty - you could trade off points in other stats for it but I found this the most acceptable since I can buff it to 10 or higher using bull's strength from relatively early on.  <br><br>I didn't want to lower int because of skillpoints and IKD, an didn't want to lower con because this build's got relatively low hitpoints.<br><br><b>Q:  Why halfling?  Why not human?</b><br>A:  You can be human - in fact if you don't like having an 8 strength and wielding a dagger, you should be.  I'd use the free feat at level 1 on strong soul to pump those saves and compensate a bit for not having the halfling's Lucky and Fearless traits.  The extra skillpoints won't hurt you either.  <br><br>But halfling yields this build +1 to AB and +1 to AC over a human, in addition to the racial innate abilities, doesn't get an exp penalty, and I like making Halflings of Doom.<br><br><b>Q:  Why not use a kukri?  Heck, isn't having to use a dagger reason enough not to be a halfling?</b><br>A:  I didn't think kukri was worth burning a feat on, especially because I had to get weapon focus before I started getting any bonus feats from COT and that resulted in some tightness in the feats.<br><br>There's no reason not to use a dagger, in my opinion.  With 8d6 sneak attacks, the damage dice of whatever weapon you wield will be far overshadowed by your sneak damage.<br><br><b>Q:  But doesn't being small work against you for using knockdowns?</b><br>A:  Unfortunately yes, you won't be knocking down anything very big and will have a harder time knocking down medium sized opponents than a human would.  Luckily you have creature summoning and darkness/ultravision to fall back on for generating sneak attacks, and a taunt/curse song combo can make IKD a breeze to land, even on people with good discipline skill values.<br><br>And once you start stacking crippling strikes on top of that, it just gets easier and easier to beat the victim's discipline every time.<br><br><b>Q:  Aren't your fort and will saves kinda low for a COT build?</b><br>A:  Yes... I was disappointed by that.  It's kinda sad about dex builds - they often end up with huge reflex saves when thanks to improved evasion they really don't need it.  You might want to replace Improved Critical with Great Fortitude, or try to rearrange things to take Strong Soul at level 1 and drop Improved Critical to preserve your other feats, depending on your environment.  Taking knockdown at level 1 was sort of a default because I couldn't get Finesse until level 3.<br><br>This is a place where the Halfling choice shines, though - their racial saving throw bonuses help the fort and will saves into an area where they are "average" instead of "poor."<br><br><b>Q:  Why didn't you make this a plate-wearing human strength build, and magic be damned?</b><br>A:  That build could work, but it's a seperate build for another time.  The major factors going into this particular build being a dex character were epic dodge and not worrying about arcane failure.  Halfling came after, but worked out quite nice at it.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Xylophone on 12/01/05 07:54</span></i></p>

It has potential.  As a platform or inspiration, particularly.  <br><br>I haven't ever built halfing and given the disastrous results of my dwarf efforts, I won't start now (humans and elves for me, thanks).<br><br>The AB and AC are impressive.  And the Grizz would point out that the rogue levels prevent at least THIS dex build from suffering the big AC drop when flat-footed.  So he will be hard to hit, regardless.  Would be great if you could work some self-concealment in but that is the rub in building, what makes it fun.<br><br><br><br>By the way, experience teaches that judgment is spelled without an "e." <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Cheers.

Bard gets displacement and improved invisibility as level 3 and 4 spells, respectively - you don't need SC <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   The main drawback of it is that it's dispellable, but considering that you'd need five epic feats to get SC 5, I think it's a pretty valid trade-off to use your spells instead.<br><br>Looking at this build again, I'm tempted to make a version that sacrifices bard levels in favor of COT and rogue - possibly 11 bard/19 rogue/10 COT - but I do think this guy can stand on his own merits.  The level 16 bardsong is very nice, after all, and the more people in your party, the better it gets.  Maybe I'll do the 11/19/10 variant as a different race.<br><br>Experience also teaches that judgement is in the dictionary as I spell it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   Admittedly, judgment is too, but doesn't look right in text (it, not spelled the way it's pronounced) in the opinion of this American English-speaker.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

I agree with your SC analysis and retract the thought.  <br><br>On switching the Bard to Rogue, I wouldn't. level 16 bard song adds +5 to AC and takes 5 away from AC through Curse Song.  I was actually looking at your pre-epic feats to see if you could squeeze in lingering song, so I would be very much against that.  You would, of course, pick up the extra rogue feat and 2d6 of sneak, so it would not be worthless.  Just not worth as much as that bard song.  Level 11 only adds/takes 2 from AC.  The 16 song also adds/takes hit points and skill points and save points, so it is a big intangible to play around with.<br><br>For what it's worth.  <br><br>And I yield to your dictionary (maybe I should ask which dictionary that is <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  ), but I will still spell it judgment.  <br><br>---------------<br><br><i>It's judgment, dammit, JUDGMENT!</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Ithacan on 12/02/05 00:05</span></i></p>
