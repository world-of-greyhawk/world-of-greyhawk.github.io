Here's a dragon build which does not <i>rely</i> on his/her dragon shape, having at his/her disposal clerical and druidical powers. And once you are able to turn into a dragon... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">      <br>25 cleric lvls to counter dispelling and toolset SR (together with SP feats of course), 14 druid lvls as the minimum to get dragon shape and 1 monk lvl for cheese, of course <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">       Actually the build started off as a CLC 26/ DR 14 but I couldn't resist the benefits that 1 single monk lvl would bring.<br>Dragon shape at 33rd lvl already, you have to wait till 39th to get all the monk's boni though (that's to max out discipline and tumble, move it down if you feel you need the monk's boni earlier).<br>Domains are what you feel suits you best, I chose trickery for II and travel for haste. <br>Melee presence till you get dragon shape is given by buffs, expertise for protection, zen archery to get a decent AB early on, at least with ranged attacks. Pity there's no Intuitive Attack feat (PrC feat, the same of Zen Archery but works with simple melee weapons...if you play on a PrC module take Int.Att. instead of Zen Archery).<br>I guess that's all, I'll let you judge the build:<br><br> <br><b>Order of Jormundgandr</b><br>Cleric(25), Druid(14), Monk(1)<br>Human, Lawful Neutral<br><i>PvM playable 1-40, untested PvP</i><br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 18 (32)<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 360<br>Skillpoints: 251<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 25/35/16<br>BAB: 25<br>AB (max, naked): 26 (melee), 37 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 31/31<br>Spell Casting: Cleric(9),Druid(7)<br>Stunning Fist: 1/day, DC 41<br><br><b>SKILLS</b><br>Concentration 43(44), Discipline 42(42), Spellcraft 43(45), Tumble 40(40), 83 points leftover<br><br><br><b>LVL BREAKDOWN</b><br>01: Druid(1): Expertise, Spell Penetration<br>02: Druid(2)<br>03: Druid(3): Extend Spell<br>04: Druid(4): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br>05: Druid(5)<br>06: Druid(6): Zen Archery<br>07: Druid(7)<br>08: Druid(8): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br>09: Cleric(1): Empower Spell,Domain: Travel, Trickery<br>10: Cleric(2)<br>11: Cleric(3)<br>12: Cleric(4): WIS+1, Greater Spell Penetration, (WIS=21)<br>13: Cleric(5)<br>14: Cleric(6)<br>15: Cleric(7): Knockdown<br>16: Cleric(8): WIS+1, (WIS=22)<br>17: Cleric(9)<br>18: Cleric(10): Improved Critical: Unarmed<br>19: Cleric(11)<br>20: Cleric(12): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br>21: Cleric(13): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=24)<br>22: Cleric(14)<br>23: Cleric(15)<br>24: Cleric(16): WIS+1, Great Wisdom II, (WIS=26)<br>25: Cleric(17)<br>26: Cleric(18)<br>27: Cleric(19): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=27)<br>28: Druid(9): WIS+1, (WIS=28)<br>29: Druid(10)<br>30: Druid(11): Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=29)<br>31: Druid(12)<br>32: Druid(13): WIS+1, (WIS=30)<br>33: Druid(14): Dragon Shape<br>34: Cleric(20)<br>35: Cleric(21)<br>36: Cleric(22): WIS+1, Epic Spell Penetration, (WIS=31)<br>37: Cleric(23): Armor Skin<br>38: Cleric(24)<br>39: Monk(1): Epic Prowess,M:(Cleave,Evasion,IUS, St.F)<br>40: Cleric(25): WIS+1, (WIS=32)<br><br><br><b>SKILL BREAKDOWN</b><br>01: Concentration(4), Spellcraft(3), Save(21), <br>02: Concentration(1), Save(6), <br>03: Concentration(1), Save(6), <br>04: Concentration(1), Save(6), <br>05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(1), <br>06: Concentration(1), Save(6), <br>07: Concentration(1), Save(6), <br>08: Concentration(1), Save(6), <br>09: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br>10: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), <br>11: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br>12: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br>13: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br>14: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br>15: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), <br>16: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br>17: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br>18: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br>19: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br>20: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), <br>21: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br>22: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br>23: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br>24: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br>25: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), <br>26: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br>27: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br>28: Concentration(1), Save(6), <br>29: Concentration(1), Save(6), <br>30: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(1), <br>31: Concentration(1), Save(6), <br>32: Concentration(1), Save(6), <br>33: Concentration(1), Save(6), <br>34: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br>35: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), <br>36: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br>37: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br>38: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br>39: Concentration(1), Discipline(42), Tumble(40), <br>40: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5) <br><br>Feedback and constructive criticism is gladly appreciated.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Wait for me Dragon, we'll meet in the sky<br>By fire and magic, I'm sworn<br>Hell is calling, we cannot be denied<br>Fly to the blackness of the Storm<br><br>We must die to be reborn!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 05/09/09 22:17</span></i></p>

His BAB is 25, and that gives him only 5 attacks. DP gives him fighter BAB which qualifies for an extra attack. That extra attack comes out last in the sequence, but before the flurry attack and before the Haste attack. Also, that extra attack comes out at best BAB, that means 70 in the flurry as I type it, not 55 like you type. That is the beauty of DP. I have my Haste attack last in my attack shedule. And it comes last in all attack schedules, not just unarmed.<br><br>I see i have some testing to do, about Great STR feats, and also that WF, EWF thing which I was confident worked.

Yeah, thanks. It was a looong test and still it was not final since some points remain unclear.<br><br>I'm anyhow satisfied with final dragon stats, even though AB could be better. I forgot totally about the -2 AB due to size when posting the dragon stats. It's a real pity WF/EWF do not work, you could cap at 72 where now you cap at 69.

Thanks Kail. I was sure EWF worked, you know. My sheet with the feats showed actually 1 lower than what the actual combat rolls were, so I thought EP didn't show on the sheet. But with the +6 claws and the size thing I understand. About AC. When you shift forms, many of your AC bonuses become deflection, so no stacking. Why STR modifiers from both shield and armor doesn't stack, who knows. Barkskin definitly work. As for defensive stance: You get the save bonuses and ability modifiers, but not the AC at least not on the sheet, but enemies seem to hit me much less frequently when my Dragon is in def stance. So who knows. I will see if I can check what AC you get in the combat debugger.

Please let me know the results of the tests with defensive stance.<br><br>I further tested with combat debugging and found out the following:<br><br>1. Dragons are <b>-2 AC</b> due to size. This is <b>not</b> shown on the sheet. Your <b>real</b> AC is therefore <b>AC 62 unbuffed</b>, and <b>AC 80 fully buffed</b>.<br><br>2. Dragons have a <b>+20 dodge AC</b> which counts towards the cap. Hence, <i>haste bonus to AC is lost when shifted</i> (but not the extra attack and speed). Haste though compensates for the -1 dodge AC given by blood frenzy.<br><br>3. When shifting <b>armor bonus to AC becomes deflection bonus</b>: hence magic vestment (cast on your normal clothes f.e.) <b>does not</b> stack with shield of faith.<br><br>4. PfA, MCaA, AaA all give def bonus to AC, hence they do not stack (even in human form), I believe ST boni stack but I've not tested that yet. Immunities given by the spells normally apply of course.<br><br>5. Barkskin works normally, since it remains +5 natural armor bonus to AC (at his maximum).<br><br>6. Armor skin and monk's WIS bonus to AC are considered natural armor boni  <b>not counting</b> towards the cap (therefore they stack with barkskin).<br><br>7. Previous results about AB are confirmed. Dragon claws are +6 weapons (+6 AB/+6 DMG) and the dragon is a huge creature (-2 AB). Both these modifiers <b>are not shown</b> on your sheet. Hence, your AB is +4 compared to what the sheet says. WF/EWF unarmed <b>do not</b> work, but EP does. Since with all buffs on I get +15 AB, I easily cap in dragon form since the +6 claws count toward the cap. I still have a +5 AB margin as a human though. Guess I'm gonna get the help of some bard, eh-eh.<br><br>So, to improve AC you are left with exp/IE, high AC bonus armor to merge, cat's grace potions and probably bard song... does anybody know what kind of bonus to AC the bard song gives and if it counts towards the cap?<br><br>AB 69 is as good as it gets in dragon form, at least if they don't make WF/EWF unarmed work.<br><br>I believe that's all for now.<br><br><i>EDIT</i>: quickly tested the defensive stance issue, by downloading the dragon savant and going through combat debugging. Defensive stance <b>does not</b> give you any bonus to AC when in dragon form, because  it's a dodge bonus appareantly counting toward the cap, which you already reach as a dragon with your +20 dodge AC (see point 2). The other boni apply normally.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 01/04/06 17:41</span></i></p>

I suppose you could make the build even more playable going 24 cleric 14 druid 2 monk so you got a skill dump and earlier monk progression.<br><br>Except for 1 casterlevel of cleric you lose nothing but gain deflect arrows later on and an extra stunning fist.<br><br>This build looks decent and should be quite useful.

Unshift, Greater Sanctuary, Implosion should do the trick. Unshift then GS is one good way to get out of trouble should you face it. The dragon is a powerful (the most powerful) resource you've got but you are also a good spellcaster, let's not forget about it. You've got many tricks up your sleeve. But true, pure (or nearly so) arcane spellcasters are a pain in the @ss, but for whom they are not?<br><br>I chose to go with 25 lvls of cleric to be undispellable (mords apart of course). I find the build very playable even with just one monk lvl, the second would add some playability (monk's bonus to AC in shifted forms, monk's attack progression) and make the dragon shape more powerful earlier at the cost of xp penalty and 5% chance of getting dispelled.

Some more on the dragon attacks and AB...<br><br>The dragon shapes have three attacks, claw, claw, bite. The claws do 2d8 slash/pierce damage and have +6 enhancement. They are also the source of a dragon's 40/+6 DR. The bite attack does 2d8 slashing only, with no additional benefits. It still pierces DR because of the dragon's own DR, but damage and ab are both 6 points lower than on the claw attacks.<br><br>Normally I think you'll cycle through the three attacks each round, so with 5 attacks it makes claw1, claw2, bite, claw1, claw2. I don't know how that is affected by "special" extra attacks though, like flurry of blows, haste, AoO, divine power.

I am wondering if Kail even knows now, considering its almost 2 years old!  We generally dont worry about posting buffs.<br><br>I am not sure what you mean about stats?  You didnt get 32 widsom?  It is the only thing added too.  If you didnt get 32, then yes you did something wrong.  Kail has always been VERY consciencious of posting true and accurate builds.  If you are having troubles, print off the post and go thru it lvl by lvl.  <br><br>Other than that, there isnt really anything we can do for you cuz we cant see your build!  We assume you are building what Kail did.  <br><br>In the end though, if Kail says it, you can bank on it.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Man, I can't really laugh at that after I've made the same kind of mistaked statements.<br><br>He might have gone to the level 60 PW Kalmar_Oxin mentioned... if you weren't quoted that he posted that on WoG forums of course.<br><br>Sounds to me like you enjoy watching Kail suffering at WoG rather than "compassionately" helping him grizz; that kind of detailed information about Kail's whereabouts makes me wonder if you're really asking for an extraction team or maybe you killed the last one that went out to save him.

OK, I am well aware of that htis is a very old post. But it's still is an extremely strong build. <br><br>Now the question I have is that - have they changed the prerequisits for Dragon Shape? It seems I cannot get it until I have 18 levels of Druid.<br><br>Peace always

Yes this build is no longer a legal build, as are many dragon shape builds as of 1.69.  Also keep in mind that old epic dodge builds may take epic dodge before 27 because 30 tumble was only a requirement in the 1.69.  Also there are many club exploit builds that can no longer be produced because 1.69 filled in the missing prerequisites in club feats.

It's not difficult to make the appropiate change, you just lower Cleric to meet the dragon pre-requisite of Druid levels. Or you could go back to and older version and enjoy it as it is, your choice.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
