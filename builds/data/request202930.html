Well you already have and idea of what you want, so build it...or finish it if you have already started the build. I am sure that the reason no one has bothered to help you is because this build has, more than likely, been done a thousand times.  I wish I could be of some help, but I am not as knowledge able as the rest of the people here in the ways of what you need.

Instead of taking so few bard levels, why not like 4-5 rogue levels instead?  You'ld get sneak damage on your arrows.  I love the Bard, but taking less than 15-16 levels doesn't allow the full benefits of the class to shine through.<br><br>Also, if you're going to have 13 strenght, maybe you should consider Power Attack -&gt; Divine Might.  DIvine Might allows you to add charisma bonus to the damage to deal, this includes in ranged attacks.  So find yourself some charisma boosting items, and cast eagle-splendor, and you got yourself a better damage dealer.<br><br>Hope this helps a bit.

A cleric(7)/bard(1) only has a BAB of 5, and you need a BAB of 6 to take Arcane Archer.  So, you'd need to move another level of bard or cleric before your first AA level.<br><br>I'd honestly probably use less bard...maybe something like cleric(15)/bard(2)/AA(23).  Or maybe if you wanted another AA bonus feat, cleric(12)/bard(2)/AA(26).  Take the last bard level very late to max tumble and UMD.  15 levels of cleric maxes out a number of your cleric buffs, although 12 takes you most of the way to maxing them out if you could use the extra feat.<br><br>Rapid shot is definitely one you want to pick up, but the power attack/improved power attack feats are for melee weapons only.  Power Attack is still nice if you want to use Divine Might and Shield though.<br><br>Steve
