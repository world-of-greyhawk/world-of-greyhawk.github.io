I'm toying around with the cleric class lately and I tried to build one over the dispel cap, able to pierce SR (monks apart, of course), with a high save DC, focusing (guess what?) on implosion <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">  <br>Melee presence is granted by divine power+buffs (that's why BAB was intentionally kept at 25). Fighter was chosen to get martial weapon right from the start +WS/EWS.CoT for save boosting and bonus feats (foregoing the CHA related special abilities).<br>Starting STR could be lower but I wanted to have some carrying capacity without buffs and to make earlier lvls easier.<br>Domains were chosen for the extra spells of course(mage armor, barkskin help at lower lvls, stoneskin, icestorm and creeping doom are always handy)<br>Expertise/Improved expertise to pump up AC while casting spells (even on PWs where they switch it off while casting exp deactivates after you cast not before or during eh-eh...just reactivate it immediately after casting and your AC will always be +5/10).<br><br>Now a couple of questions:<br>1) Is it really worthwhile to get over the SR cap of 32? Those two feats I use up to grant me enough penetration could be spent on skills like KD/IKD or blind fighting, called shot or anything else to round up the build and maybe I could just focus on no SR spells<br>2) Greater ruin or Hellball?<br>3) How would the build fare in PvP?<br><br>Here's the build:<br><b>Cleric 26/ CoT 10/Fighter 4</b><br>Human, any non-evil<br><br><br>STR 12<br>CON 14<br>DEX 12<br>INT 14<br>WIS 16 (34)<br>CHA 8<br><br>HP: 460<br>SkP: 215<br><br>BAB: 25<br>AB: 30<br>AC: 17<br><br>DC: 22+Spell Lvl<br>DC Evocation: 34+Spell Lvl<br>DC Implosion: <b>46</b> (52 with capped WIS!!!)	<br>SP: 32	<br><br><br>SAVES (vs Spells)<br>For  31 (40)<br>Ref  22 (31)<br>Will 38 (47)<br><br>SKILLS (215)<br>Concentration 43 (44)<br>Spellcraft 43 (42)<br>Discipline 42 (44)<br>Heal 43 (55)<br>Tumble 20 (21)<br>4 points leftover<br><br><br>1  Cleric  1  Spell Penetration, Expertise, Domains:Magic,Plant<br>2  Fighter 1  WF		<br>3  Cleric  2  Greater SP			<br>4  Fighter 2  Improved Expertise, WIS (WIS 17)<br>5  Cleric  3				<br>6  Cleric  4  Extend Spell			<br>7  Cleric  5				<br>8  Cleric  6  WIS (WIS 18)<br>9  Cleric  7  Empower Spell			<br>10 Cleric  8				<br>11 Cleric  9				<br>12 Cleric  10 SF: Evocation, WIS (WIS 19)<br>13 Cleric  11				<br>14 Cleric  12				<br>15 Cleric  13 GSF:Evocation			<br>16 Cleric  14 WIS (WIS 20)<br>17 Cleric  15				<br>18 Cleric  16 Toughness			<br>19 Cleric  17				<br>20 Cleric  18 WIS (WIS 21)<br>21 CoT	   1  EWF			<br>22 CoT	   2  Great WIS I (WIS 22)<br>23 Fighter 3				<br>24 Fighter 4  WS, EWS, WIS (WIS 23)<br>25 Cleric  19				<br>26 Cleric  20				<br>27 Cleric  21 ES: Greater Ruin or EP			<br>28 Cleric  22 WIS (WIS 24)<br>29 CoT	   3				<br>30 Cleric  23 EP or ES: Hellball, ESF: Evocation		<br>31 CoT	   4  Great WIS II (WIS 25)<br>32 Cleric  24 WIS (WIS 26)<br>33 CoT	   5  Great WIS III (WIS 27)<br>34 CoT	   6  Great WIS IV (WIS 28 )<br>35 CoT	   7				<br>36 CoT	   8  Great WIS V, Great WIS VI, WIS (WIS 31)<br>37 Cleric  25				<br>38 CoT	   9				<br>39 CoT	   10 Great WIS VII, Great WIS VIII (WIS 33)<br>40 Cleric  26 AS, WIS (WIS 34)<br><br><br>What do you think of the build?

I built it in my lvler module and I realized my evocation spells DC is lower than I thought. 6 points lower. I came to the conclusion that the various SF do not stack, can anyone confirm it?<br>Bah, implosion DC is a "mere" 40 now, 46 with capped WIS. I'm disappointed I though SF boni were meant to stack

Spell DC = 10 + Spell Level + Casting Ability Modifier + Bonus Feats<br><br>so based on WIS of 34 (46 capped) would give 18<br><br>DC = 10 + 9 + 18 + 6 = 43<br><br>With Implosion quirk of +3 = 46<br><br>The only way to get this higher is to max WIS, achieving a base of 38 by 40th level and receiving 12 points bonus through items or buffs. <br><br>This would in turn give you a max of 48.<br><br>Sadly Spell Focus feats do not stack, the max is 6 points after Epic.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 12/11/05 22:48</span></i></p>

Thanks for the info, 46 base DC was too good to be true <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br>What about spell penetration feats, do they stack? I took SP and GSP, do I get +4 or +6 penetration?

The max possible spell save DC is 48 - and it's only achievable with Implosion's save DC increase, base wis 38, epic focus evocation, and cap-buffed wisdom.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"><br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Thanks all for clarifying the non-stacking nature of the SF/SP feats. I can still reach 46 DC with capped wisdom which is not that bad, eh-eh (altough 52 would have been waaaay better). Pity clerics do not get owl's insight.<br>This point cleared, what do you think of other aspects of the build?

Personally I am not sure of the benefits that Fighter brings to the mix. I find generally that I can live without WS and EWS on account of the buffing ability that a cleric brings through Darkfire, GWS and so on. <br><br>I would give some thought to Bard perhaps to maximise the benefit of Tumble (AC +4 as it is now a class skill) and consider taking Lingering/ Curse Song.
