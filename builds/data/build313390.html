An item that gives trueseeing (for example) may negate the need for knowing see invisibility ultravision, and amplify, allowing one to take eagle’s splendor, cat’s grace, and charm person (for merchants) as well as spend the listen skill points in another skill like appraise(for example).  Adjust the spell selection according to the environment.<br><br>Also you may wish to remove skill focus: perform in order to take weapon proficiency: martial and make use of the <b>halberd</b> instead of the spear.  The focus on perform was an attempt (which supplemented by gear) is likely to reach at least the level 25 curse song (and possibly the level 25 bard song) in which another point in AC (or loss for enemies) is given.<br><br>Warning: This build is designed for a module that supports horses.  The assumptions made suppose that the default Bioware scripts for this are used.  Different PWs may handle horses differently.<br><br>--<br>Aside to Pulse Cap: This build uses a class that is not currently in your engine.

It is one of the highest (non-dragon shape) strength builds to up the DC.  However, I will admit, a DC range of 29-35 is still fairly low.

I so want to like PDK. I give every class a chance, try not to discriminate, and yet this class just has so few redeeming features. I have kicked around with a Druid/cot/pdk and even a Druid/Barb/PDK which were fun enough, but the short durations and waaay too limited uses per day of the PDK feats means it is just really hard to justify other than for minor utility, quirky fun or RP use.

Reducing strength and getting prowess nets +0 AB -(1 to 2) damage and -1 to fear DC (possibly gaining +1 AC if equipment/spells are not sufficient to meet the max dex AC of the armor). Going 5 more RDD and 5 less bard nets about -4 to skills (about a -1 to ride AC) +1 to AC, and 30HP, with less duration less bard song, and the ability to be dispelled (25% chance per buff) by anyone with greater dispelling.<br><br>I was debating between 15 RDD 20 Bard and 10 RDD 25 Bard quite a bit when making this build, and decided the latter was more promising.<br><br>One thing I was tempted to do if I lowered strength by two (one initial one less great strength) for one epic feat and +2 dex was to take Epic Skill Focus: Tumble.  This would provide riding tumble checks of 43 (ranks) + 10 (epic skill focus) - 50 (ride penalty) - 2 (armor check penalty) + dex modifier + skill bonus(from bard song) which doesn't take too much item property wise to reach the magic 14 (no attacks of opportunity from movement).  +1 perform (achievable with eagle's splendor) gives +11 from bard song, cat's grace gives +2 to dex (which is the magic 14).<br><br>The one major drawback of reducing strength is that for each point the fear DC is lowered, the less the PDK investment is worth it when compared to barbarian.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By WhiZard on 11/11/09 02:47</span></i></p>

I was under the impression that mounted combat was capped at +6ac (= 40 ride - 10 x 5). Not sure where i got that from, so i actually assigned more skills than i theoretically should have.. they dont call me mr 80% for nuthin...<br><br>Dispelling .. yeah i agree, it can be a pain, but the bard is pretty much non-reliant on the buffs it doesnt really matter that much, i see them as gravy. Pretty simple to recast the important one imho (displacement) if required. I should have mentioned that some ppl may prefer still over extend for this reason.. this i think is very much environment and player dependent, but i dont think it breaks the build.<br><br>I guess i like my toons to lean more towards being as well-rounded as possible, hence going for KD, taunt, and easing back on the bard lvls. KD especially cos spear = large, which i like vs casters and ppl holding small weapons .. so i guess kd introduces slightly better synergy with the build concept, which would be harder to do with retaining sf:perform.<br><br>so for me, KD+Taunt &gt; chance of greater dispel<br><br>Dunno why, but the 20/15/5 split appeals more to me .. more 'dragonny', more options.<br><br><br>re druid/monk/pdk ..  i have built a *meh* disposition to monk draggys.. been there, done that, bought the crappy t-shirt. I like to explore the quirkier side nowdays to keep the interest alive.<br><br>Im still very much learning though, and for me its more about trial and error than builds thought out to the nth degree.<br><br>Keep the builds comin, would like to see more ideas around pdk, gimped as they are.

Knockdown gets no benefit from weapon size (though disarm does).  As far as undispellable buffs, any party will really like a good meleer that can spin off an undispellable 25 round mass haste.

Argh, how did i miss that .. oh thats right .. im an amateur. I thank you for taking me back to the learning tree.<br><br>I orginally started with 16 Int, and had tumble in there.

This class was made for a specific module that has a low level cap. less than 20. in those low level worlds it may shine. Somebody should consider making a level 20 build instead.

A level 20 build can definitely benefit from a fear spell that can go through spell mantles.  Try the human bard/RDD/PDK, for example.  With a level 20 strength of 30 + buffs, the DC (25 + 1/2 buff) is pretty difficult to make a save against.  Or take wizard 17/PDK 3, polymorph into an adult red dragon and cast an even higher DC (26 + 1/2 buff) PDK fear spell in that form.

There is a lv 20/30 Guild that was created long ago for builds.  If memory serves, Grim started it.  Alas, a class specifically designed for low magic worlds excites me almost as much as root canals without any meds, and it really isnt very epic.
