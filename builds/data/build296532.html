The build is meant to be played from lvl 1 and up. The main body of Cleric levels comes early for increased playability. From lvl 7 on the character wears robes and wields a Kama. Monk is there for the cheese, but also as a stepping stone to get Shadowdancer early. <br><br>Why make a HIPSing, SC-V, ED Cleric?<br>Because I can! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br>In fact, the question I asked myself before making the build was: Can it be done? And if so, what can the Cleric class add to a ED, SC-V build? <br>Cleric spells give the character the damage punch that dexterity based characters often lack in low and mid magic environments. SC-V, when you finally get it, is completely untouchable, but you get it late. In the mean time Improved Invisibility gives concealment. The other Cleric spells and abilities add both to the fighting and adventuring versatility.<br><br>Why take Trickery and War domains?<br>I chose Trickery to get the domain power with a +9 bonus to Hide and Move Silently, and to get Improved Invisibility in early and mid levels. War domain was to get Cats, Aura of Vitality and Battlemaster. Other options are Strength for more Divine Power slots and Travel for Haste.<br><br>Other builds like this one?<br>No. <br><br>Pros:<br>A sneaker with HIPS, ED and SC-V<br>Monk cheese<br>Most of the Cleric goodies<br><br>Cons:<br>20% XP penalty from lvl 7<br>Only lvl 8 spells and the lvl 7 and 8 spells come late<br>Only immune to Lesser Dispel<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 05/14/08 12:01</span></i></p>

You can get wis 19 if you start out with int 10, con 10 and wis 17 or if you sacrifice EWS for greater wis I. I don't think its worth it to get lvl 9 spells. You could get access to lvl 7 spells earlier though. I still doubt it is worth it.<br>The reason why I take more than 15 cleric levels is to delay the SD 16 lvl so I can take SC as a bonus feat. I also wanted a spellcraft skilldump.<br>I could have taken 2 monk lvls to get the first part of that. But I chose cleric for more spellslots and longer duration of the spells.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

I feel the only thing you get for 22 levels of SD is HiPS. You get concealment from ImpInvis, and you also have Darkness. Wouldn't you be better off just ditching the whole SD class and go for rogue? (although it would be close to Finns build) Either that or keep HiPS, stop SD at 5 for Epic Dodge and split the 17 levels left between Monk and Cleric?<br><br>Keep in mind though, that I have never seen the use of SD except for getting HiPS, or taking it to 5 to get access to Epic Dodge in different combos, like this.<br><br>Cleric17/Monk18/SD5 is what I would have considered, or even Cleric23-25/SD5/monk9-12.

Cleric 26/ Monk 9/ SD5 is a great indispellable dex build that gets ED. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>In this build though, I think in the opposite direction. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Instead of taking a cleric and making a dexer and sneaker out of it, I start with a ED SC-V build and see what i can get if I add cleric to the mix.

Finn has proved that. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>There is a significant difference between the two classes when it comes to feats. Let me put it this way:<br>19 lvls of rogue give you 4 bonus feats, two of which you need for improved evasion and defensive roll. You have 2 left for SC or ED. If you try to take 24 lvls of rogue, rogue lvl 16 comes too early to get SC, unless you start out with a higher dex and a lower con and int than I do, or delay EWS until late in the build. (Look at how Finn did it)<br>10 lvls of SD give you improved evasion and defensive roll + more . 22 lvls of SD gives 4 epic bonus feats on top of that for SC and ED.
