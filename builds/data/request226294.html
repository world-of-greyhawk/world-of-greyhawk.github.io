A quick build <b>without</b> UMD but with decent saves, will apart (it gets decent vs spells tough).

just a question. and it might be a silly one since what i know about good builds is horrid. <br><br>would it not be better to got fighter / wm than to throw in a third class as well? i mean that way i could end up with something like fighter 6 wm 34 or so. just asking. saves arent overly important as on my server you can get immunity to almost everything.<br><br>also i went with greatsword as the subrace i am using treats it as a one handed weapon ( plus it just looks cool holding one in one hand <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  )<br><br>FP

Here's the <b>cheesey version</b> of the first build. Drop CoT, go FTR 11 (to get EWS in epic) and take a late Bard lvl to max out spellcraft (+4 saves vs spells), tumble (+4 AC) and UMD. Adjust starting stats, since you'll be using one Great STR slot to grab EWS and therefore would end with -1 STR. DEX up to 14 (+1 ref save), WIS to 10 (+1 will save), STR reduced to 16 to end on an even number. Put 5 points into perform to use 1 song a day to make up for lost AB and damage for 10 rounds. Saves do suffer, but you compensate by getting a further +4 vs spells. Taunt is a bard class skill but you haven't got the points to make it effective, unless you drop discipline, which you might consider since you told KD is not worth it...I guess you have easy access to items with KD immunuty. If it is so, then drop discipline and max taunt on your bard lvl.<br>Here we go:<br><br>Fighter(11), Bard(1), Weapon Master(28)<br>Dwarf, any non lawful alignment<br>PvP, PvP playable 1-40<br><br>STR: 16 (32)<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 16<br>WIS: 10<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 6<br><br>Hitpoints: 576<br>Skillpoints: 174<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 23/16/22 (+10 vs spells)<br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 52 (melee), 33 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 22/32<br><br><br>Discipline 41(52), Intimidate 4(2), Perform 5(3), Spellcraft 38(40), Tumble 40(42), UMD 42(40), no points leftover.<br><br>01: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus, Dodge<br>02: Fighter(2): Expertise<br>03: Fighter(3): Mobility<br>04: Fighter(4): STR+1, Weapon Specialization, (STR=17)<br>05: Fighter(5)<br>06: Fighter(6): Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack<br>07: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice<br>08: Weapon Master(2): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>09: Weapon Master(3): Improved Critical<br>10: Weapon Master(4)<br>11: Weapon Master(5)<br>12: Weapon Master(6): STR+1, Blind Fight, (STR=19)<br>13: Weapon Master(7)<br>14: Weapon Master(8)<br>15: Weapon Master(9): Power Attack<br>16: Weapon Master(10): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>17: Fighter(7)<br>18: Fighter(8): Toughness, Cleave<br>19: Fighter(9)<br>20: Fighter(10): STR+1, Great Cleave, (STR=21)<br>21: Weapon Master(11): Great Strength I, (STR=22)<br>22: Weapon Master(12)<br>23: Weapon Master(13): Epic Weapon Focus<br>24: Fighter(11): STR+1, Epic Weapon Specialization, (STR=23)<br>25: Weapon Master(14)<br>26: Weapon Master(15)<br>27: Weapon Master(16): Great Strength II, Overwhelming Critical, (STR=24)<br>28: Weapon Master(17): STR+1, (STR=25)<br>29: Weapon Master(18)<br>30: Weapon Master(19): Great Strength III, Devastating Critical, (STR=26)<br>31: Weapon Master(20)<br>32: Weapon Master(21): STR+1, (STR=27)<br>33: Weapon Master(22): Great Strength IV, Armor Skin, (STR=28)<br>34: Weapon Master(23)<br>35: Weapon Master(24)<br>36: Weapon Master(25): STR+1, Great Strength V, Epic Prowess, (STR=30)<br>37: Weapon Master(26)<br>38: Weapon Master(27)<br>39: Bard(1): Great Strength VI, (STR=31)<br>40: Weapon Master(28): STR+1, Epic Toughness I, (STR=32)<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

doh. forgot completely about the prestige cap at 30. hmm the ftr/cot/wm way looks about the best then. thanks again for the help.<br><br>am an ogre mage. plus the subrace gives some nice stat bonuses as well. +4 str +4 con +2 wis +2 cha +6 int and regen +5 all this at an ecl of 5 (ugh) makes levelling after 35 very slow but its worth it in the long run. so basically i am running around as this giant blue dude with one huge sword and a tower shield and pummeling the living daylights out of things. nice <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
