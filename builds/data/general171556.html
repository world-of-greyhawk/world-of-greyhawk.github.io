Im curious as to whether a monk can effectivly use non-class related weapon profs. Say I wanted a monk to wield a Great Sword for example, can I expect to have 5 attacks/ round with it? Would I still be able to use Flurry of Blows?

First off, I'm not a good builder; this is just observation from my own tests:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/22/04 01:25:52 (GMT) -- Modern Prometheus<br><br>Im curious as to whether a monk can effectivly use non-class related weapon profs.

I believe the only weapon that uses the monks higher unarmed attack rate is kamas in NWN compared to the pnp version which has several others. As for build routes with a monk, many are viable. Some that go wisdom are nice for if you actually plan on using unarmed combat. Others that use str or dex are both good options. There are tons of variations on the builds page.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

I believe there's a trick/bug/'feature' where if you wield a kama in your right hand and hold a different weapon in your left hand you still get Flurry of Blows to work. But you'll need the two weapon fighting feats to effectively wield a weapon in your off-hand.<br><br>If you want to wield a different weapon (eg. Greatsword, Katana, etc) you could take 4 fighter levels pre-epic to boost your AB to 16 thus giving you 4 attacks per round.<br><br>For example: Level 1 as Monk, levels 2-5 as Fighter (taking Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization), and then resume Monk levels to 20. In Epic levels take Epic Weapon Focus and then another fighter level (at 21, 24, or 27) to take Epic Weapon Spec. You could probably get both Epic Weapon feats on character level 21 or 24 if you take Fighter 5 at that level. (I always advise testing the build offline to ensure the level progression is accurate and well planned.)<br><br>Or you could go the dual wielding route and get 6 attacks per round with Improved Two Weapon Fighting, wielding say short swords or rapiers.<br><br>Just some ideas for you. <br><br>If you're interested, I have a build from someone else that they call The Immortal - it's a Monk 25/Fighter 8/Weapon Master 7 specializing in dual-wielding rapiers. He's a fun character to play. Monk speed plus Dual Wield plus Dev.

Weapon Finesse applies your dexterity bonus to your attack value (if it's higher than your strength bonus). No other stats are involved in Weapon Finesse. So if you're building a Dex-based monk, one of your early feats would be Weapon Finesse. You'll find many examples of this in the builds here on the guild, and by doing a search for "Monk" in the NWN boards.<br><br>Building characters is like coding HTML - just copy everyone else's work until you know what you're doing and can do it better on your own. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Kaliban<br><br>PS - Before you commit to a build on a PW, make sure you build it in an offline training mod and keep notes on the exact progression. I do all mine in an Excel file and then save them. That's where that Immortal build came from.
