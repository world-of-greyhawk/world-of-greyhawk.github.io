I'd say your best bet on a class split is 35 monk 5 Shadowdancer.  This allows you to get epic dodge, 50% conceal, and fairly good AC.  Your AB won't be anything incredible, but fair enough.<br><br>Would be dex-based, of course.  I believe on the server you play on, 65ish AC (I think?).  And 53ish AB.  But, if you want an unarmed master that's dex-based and good in PvP, you definitely want PM. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

Hah, Stunning Fist no good? you don't know what you're talking about man, anyway... No kama!? that's... about saying you don't want to add power in PvP, like if a 12 fighter/25 wm/ 3 rogue could do a thing against a dual-kama wielder Monk 9 / Cleric 25 / Fighter 6 or similar, in your case with Epic Dodge and all, I'd probably go Monk 9 / Cleric 26 / Shadowdancer 5, definitely with kamas, and those petty enemies of yours will be dust in a few rounds.<br><br>Now then, if you want unarmed so badly, how about a shifter (as in Druid/Monk/X or Druid/Shifter/Monk), in a +5 magical environment you can make excellent PvP with shifter-style builds, just check Kail's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225446", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Order of Jormundgandr (Cleric 25/ Druid 14/ Monk 1)</a>, it's one of the best PvP dragons, with buffed AB of almost 70 and buffed AC of about 80 (rough numbers).

Well, you should've said so before, that's more of an RP build if you ask me, if you ask for PvP I'll attempt to give you a powerbuild meant only to kill <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    <br><br>At any rate, you seem to want a Dexer with Epic Dodge, but that's still somewhat unspecific, say, Monk is necessary, so you need Monk/Shadowdancer or Monk/Rogue for Epic Dodge if I'm correct, which will also grant Uncanny Dodge, which will go nice on your AC, but that leaves an open third class for just about anything, I could think of Fighter, Ranger, Paladin, Blackguard, CoT, Dwarven Defender, Assassin and Barbarian, and that only since you said no casting (too bad RDD won't fit), I suppose you won't like alignment changes either, but the option is still there. Ranger 21 / Shadowdancer 5 / Monk 16 would work well, dealing 1d20 +bracers +2d6+5 vs favored enemies; 4 to 8 Fighter levels work ok too and could do wit Rogue as well instead of SD, etc. etc. give more specifics about what you like on the build and I'll whip a killing Jackie Chan for ya.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/07/07 03:09</span></i></p>

Thax,<br><br>make it Ranger 25/Monk 10/SD 5, Monk14 serves no purpose in terms of PvP.

Hm I had forgotten he wanted an unarmed monk (not optimal IMO). But still, unarmed dmg evolves at 12 and 16  so Monk14 is still no use.
