I just got the 2 expansions and I want to complete them with the same character.<br>I'm playing in solo campaign(so not online and not PvP). I was thinking of a FTR(26)WM(7)and rogue(6). He will be using a exotic weapon double blade(good choice?). Starting him as a FTR human. with:<br>STR:16<br>DEX:13<br>CON:15<br>CHA:9<br>WIS:8<br>INT:14<br>I'm mainly aim for max str and heavy armor, a guy with no magic and almost everything automatic fight(like no disarm). <br>Is it bad ? or it can be better ? maybe remove rogue and just boost FTR or take another class (shadowdancer or asassin or other one)?<br><br>For the skill I just don't know where to put them, some in discipline.<br>Is craft weapon/armor is worth the points put in ? I ear somewhere that you can only create basic weapon/armor.<br>Is disarm trap is a must to have in solo campaign, or I can survive through all traps. I remember that some traps did one-hit kill me in the original NWN game, just maybe because I didn't have enough life. Are the expansion are like it too ? <br>This skill goes with the disarm trap; search, we need to find the trap before disarm them.<br>persuasion, well I can get a lot of quest/gold with it, but only rogue have it as skill class and with disarm trap and search, I won't have enough skill points.<br>tumble is it worth to learn ? event if my character don't have the DEX as main stat.<br><br>Well so I got a few skill to choose, maybe you can help me, to find witch one is better or event some may be useless. <br>If I put the more + reflex equip and some feat to dodge trap, is this will be enough to dodge the highest trap ?<br><br>I got a few more question about the max stats cap.<br>I tested with a module the max + str on equip it was 12 for me. But is there a limit one the base STR without the equip ? or I can put all the points I will get in lvling in STR + a few lvl of Great Strength feat to get event more STR ? to have like 40-45 STR ?<br><br>Sorry for my poor english, and my poor translation, my game is in french.
