I'd have thought with 10 fighter levels you'd have been able to work in weapon specialization... or did I just not see it?<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

10 FTR lvls and no WS? That's odd. Also, why spear? You could focus on any martial weapon on a FTR lvl, spear is not the usual choice.<br>ICC without CC? I don't think it's possible<br><br>Nice concept for the build, as usual.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Joyous news: I'm here!<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;I'd have thought with 10 fighter levels you'd have been able to work in weapon specialization... or did I just not see it?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->No-no, I'm... uh... too creative for that. I'm using a two-hander and really, it's a black-and-white way of thinking to *always* have WS on fighters. See, the problem is in *your* head, not mine <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   (just kidding meh)<br><br>Spear is another RP thingy <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   Use whatever your heart desires (and is martial/simple, of course). Spear isn't that bad, though a Greatsword is probably more efficient.<br><br>As with ICC, I have no idea what happened! I started editing and came up with all sorts of funky modifications - seems like I forgot CC altogether. Spring Attack on Fighter4 and CC on Druid8 perhaps? IKD is lost that way, however.<br><br>EDIT: the lyrics are from Satyricon - Prime Evil Renaissance, copyright and all that apply.<br><br>And (sorry griphook) it's playable from 1 to 40, PvM<br>_________________<br>Surely, without war there would be no loss - hence, no mourning, no grief, no pain, no misery...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 12/26/05 21:16</span></i></p>

Looking at this now, I see that you'd better increase Wisdom at 24, 28 and 32, substituting the Great Wisdoms for Great Strengths.
