<b>PvM build 1-40</b>, probably fun PvP too<br><br>I rather thought this was a classic build type but since I couldn't find one here, I'm posting it anyway. Basic idea is simple really, snipe at your enemies with heavy sneak attack, then use hips and move to a new position, repeat as neccesary. It's somewhat focused on doing well on the PW Soul Forge, but should work ok in most party settings. I should also thank the people at the SF character building forum who helped me out with a few things.<br><br><b>Race:</b> Halfling<br><br><b>Ability scores:</b><br>Str 12<br>Dex 18 (28)<br>Con 14<br>Int 14<br>Wis 10<br>Cha 8<br><br><b>1</b> rogue 1, point blank shot<br><b>2</b> figh 1, rapid shot<br><b>3</b> figh 2, weapon focus (sling), dodge<br><b>4</b> figh 3, (+dex)<br><b>5</b> figh 4, weapon spec (sling)<br><b>6</b> rogue 2, mobility<br><b>7</b> rogue 3<br><b>8</b> SD 1, (+dex)<br><b>9</b> rogue 4, weapon finesse<br><b>10</b> rogue 5<br><b>11</b> figh 5<br><b>12</b> rogue 6, toughness, (+dex)<br><b>13</b> rogue 7<br><b>14</b> figh 6, imp crit (sling)<br><b>15</b> rogue 8, called shot<br><b>16</b> rogue 9, (+dex)<br><b>17</b> rogue 10, slippery mind<br><b>18</b> rogue 11, blind-fight<br><b>19</b> rogue 12<br><b>20</b> figh 7, (+dex)<br><b>21</b> figh 8, EWF (sling), EWS (sling)<br><b>22</b> rogue 13, imp evasion<br><b>23</b> rogue 14<br><b>24</b> rogue 15, epic skill focus (hide), (+dex)<br><b>25</b> rogue 16, defensive roll<br><b>26</b> rogue 17<br><b>27</b> rogue 18, epic skill focus (move silently)<br><b>28</b> rogue 19, imp sneak attack, (+dex)<br><b>29</b> figh 9<br><b>30</b> rogue 20, epic dodge<br><b>31</b> rogue 21<br><b>32</b> rogue 22, (+dex)<br><b>33</b> rogue 23, imp sneak attack<br><b>34</b> rogue 24, imp sneak attack<br><b>35</b> rogue 25<br><b>36</b> rogue 26, imp sneak attack, (+dex)<br><b>37</b> rogue 27<br><b>38</b> rogue 28, imp sneak attack<br><b>39</b> figh 10, epic prowess, armor skin<br><b>40</b> rogue 29, (+dex)<br><br><b>Skill points:</b> 368<br><br><b>Suggested skills:</b><br>Disable Trap 1 (10)<br>Discipline 42 (43)<br>Heal 43 (43)<br>Hide 43 (62)<br>Move Silently 43 (64)<br>Open Lock 43 (52)<br>Pick Pocket 43 (52)<br>Set Trap 34 (43)<br>Tumble 40 (49)<br>UMD 36 (35)<br><br><b>HP:</b> 402<br><b>AC:</b> 29 (with no equipment)<br><b>AB:</b> 39,34,29,24 (with sling)<br><b>Dam:</b> 1-4+6 (with sling)<br>20d6 sneak attack<br><br><b>Saves:</b><br>Fort 22<br>Reflex 32<br>Will 17<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 08/05/05 01:40</span></i></p>

Looks good to me.  I'm a closet halfling fighter/rogue fan, so I like it.  And he has the potential to take people out quicker than they would probably like.  Combined with his fat wad of skill points, he should be quite fun to play.<br><br>I'm sure someone might point out that taking that 1 SD might be better placed at, say, Lvl 21, but having HiPS for most of your pre-epic career vs. 1AB increase isn't a big deal.<br><br>Note: I think you are missing your 1st level in the build.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 08/04/05 16:12</span></i></p>

How hard woudl it be to swap your first level fighter level with the first level you take as a rogue? That might net you a few extra skill points.<br><br>/ed woops noticed the first level not being there as well. It is indeed a rogue level as your first rogue level listes says its rogue 2.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Emrill on 08/04/05 16:51</span></i></p>

Also the odd number of fighter levels pre-epic means I can get both EWF and EWS on lvl 21
