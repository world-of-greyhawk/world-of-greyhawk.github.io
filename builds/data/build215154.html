NIce build.... absolutely like the idea of just standing around and letting people kill themselves... but what do you do against range peeps... oh well.<br><br>Could be built PvM... I'd take some Druid early and let my bear companion deal some damage for me. And anything with Bard in it would work well in a party friendly world.<br><br>Still nice build... I'll build and then complain and suggest. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

interesting.  you never mentioned it, but i assume that you shift into risen lord form and use bard song/curse song.  i would recommend using gnome instead of dwarf since it will give you a bonus to CHA and only reduce your already low str lowering your AB by 1.  not really a big problem, but just a nifty idea, especially when a little gnome turns into a big cursing undead with a scythe.<br><br>i like your lay out, but a little more information on your build would be helpful for a more in depth examination.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Perception is strong and sight weak.

Actually, his stats will be the same with gnome to, since the Dwarf is penalized on CHA. So gnome for 1 more AC and AB(He would have compensated AB loss by small atature anyhow). A gnome makes the best option. NICE!<br>If you lower your starting Con by 2, you can raise starting INT with 1 and CHA with 3 (if gnome) and net you a total of 2 ability points, and lose you absolutely nothing.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 10/04/05 17:26</span></i></p>

Aren't the stats on those shifts set (like bear and panther form... sorry, I'm a pure druid fan and have avoid shifter classes like the plague) or are they like dragon shape and they get bonuses on their already set stats?

Some of the forms have set stats. Like risen lord's strength and Con I believe.<br>That goes for Dragonform to, there are no bonuses. All Dragonforms have the same STR, DEX and CON.

Yes... I remember now... (shows how long it's been since I've used Dragon Shape) you get a bonus to HP (not sure how much... but a good bit and somewhere near 45ish Str and 30-something Cons... right?) Anyway, thanks for responding and helping figure that out... and companions stats for Druids and CLerics are set but change over time... especially the bear's strength... but I was wondering about shifting... but this build is looking better and better. I built it to level 40 and I'm currently running it throughmy Gaunlet of terror... hehehehe... we'll see if it can hang with a demilich here soon.
