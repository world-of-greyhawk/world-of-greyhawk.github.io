With only 15 levels a wizard/fighter would not be very effective.  If you must be a wizard/fighter, I would suggest Wizard 8/Fighter 7.  That would give you 2 attacks per round (AB 11) and level 4 wizard spells.  Personally, I think a level 15 druid (or cleric) would be better.  You would have a higher AB 12 (14 in a wilderness area) and level 8 druid spells.  Next to wizards and sorcerers, druids have the most offensive spells:<br><br>level 1: Entangle, Grease, Sleep<br>level 2: Flame Lash, Hold Animal<br>level 3: Call Lightning, Contagion, Dominate Animal, Healing Sting, Infestation of Maggots, Quillfire, Spike Growth<br>level 4: Flame Strike, Hammer of the Gods, Hold Monster<br>level 5: Ice Storm, Slay Living, Wall of Fire, Inferno, Vine Mine<br>level 6: Crumble, Drown, Stonehold<br>level 7: Creeping Doom, Fire Storm, Harm<br>level 8: Finger of Death, Sunbeam, Bombardment, Sunburst<br><br>Plus, you have healing spells, damage reduction spells (stoneskin, greater stoneskin and premonition) and a few combat buffs.  Clerics have fewer combat spells, no damage reduction spells, but more combat buffs.  A cleric with the magic and air domains would simulate a fighter mage quite well.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

You still get a BAB of 11, so 3 attacks per round (I assume you meant 3 not 2), you still get 4th level spells, and you get an extra fighter bonus feat.  You get less castings per day, but probably enough for buffing spells and the like, and maybe a few damage spells like Isaac's Lesser Missile Storm.  Take Illusionist as a specialization.  That will give you an extra spell per day per level, and you'll only lose access to the enchantment school, which won't be useful for this build anyway (Illusion is probably the best school to choose if you're going to specialize with almost any wizard build, since enchantment is the easiest to do without).  You'll want decent dex so you can wear low spell failure armor with Cat's Grace and possibly more dex boosting items, and probably just 14 int in order to be able to cast your buffs and maybe a few spells without saves (Ice Storm, ILMS).  Maybe something like STR 16, DEX 16, CON 12, WIS 8, INT 14, CHA 8, with all 3 stat boosts at levels 4, 8, and 12 going to STR.  You'd have 7 regular feats, 5 Fighter bonus feats, and 1 wizard bonus feat.  Go for a two handed weapon like Greatsword, since you're not going to want to wear a shield anyway.  Some possible feats to get:<br><br>Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Extend Spell, Power Attack, Cleave, Knockdown, Improved Knockdown, Combat Casting, Great Cleave, Toughness, Spell Penetration, Greater Spell Penetration.<br><br>You could possibly throw in Blind Fight somewhere in there instead if you want (instead of Greater Spell Penetration for example).<br><br>For skills, you'll want Discipline, Concentration, and Spellcraft for sure.  As for the rest...you can cross class tumble (only up to 5 ranks), maybe some Lore or Heal if you want.  You'd have 90 skill points to work with, which would mean you could max (or half-max for cross class skills) 5 skills.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 06/02/05 10:02</span></i></p>

I still think a level 3 and level 4 spell are hard to give up. Maybe Wizard 8/Fighter 6/Barbarian 1 would be better?  You get uncanny dodge, barbarian rage and fast movement.  If you take the Barbarian level last, you can also dump skill points. <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Take Illusionist as a specialization.

Well, there is another option - going pure wizard!<br><br>At lvl 15 you'll have a character with BAB 7 and 2 attacks. You have to cross class discipline, and you'll get fewer combat feats.<br><br>But it can still be worth it.<br><br>You get lvl 8 arcane spells, much better summons and a lvl 15 familiar. The buffs will be better and last longer, and you'll have more of them. Greater magic weapon will give you a +5 weapon (with a lvl 7 or 8 wizard you'll only get +2). This alone brings you almost par with AB and exceeds the damage bonus from WS.<br><br>The loss of the third attack and the lower number of HPs is in many situations compensated by a better familiar and better summons that do extra attacks and take part of the damage. It will also help you that your haste spell lasts twice as long.<br><br>You use spells to improve your stats, your weapon and your defence. Damage reduction spells, improved invisibility, AC boosting spells and elemental damage shields are important parts of your defence. AB and damage is also improved by spells.<br><br>If everything else fails, you'll have efficient attack spells. Your spells DC will be a little lower than a dedicated spellslinger, but you'll do allright in most situations.<br><br>Build:<br>Human, Illusionist: Str 16, Dex 10, Con 16, Wis 8, Int 15-&gt;18, Cha 8.<br>Essential feats: WP martial or exotic, W focus (greatsword or scythe), toughness, extend spell. That leaves 5 general feats and 2 metamagic bonus feats for you to choose. You won't get improved critical (needs BAB+8), but you'll get the keen edge spell.<br>Skills: You'll get 106 skillpoints. That's almost enough to max 6 skills. I'd max discipline and concentration, and max tumble and discipline cross classed. That leaves you 34 skillpoints to play with. <br>+9 in discipline isn't much, but can be boosted some with items. +9 in tumble gives you only +1AC bonus, but let you roll a successful tumble check more often.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...
