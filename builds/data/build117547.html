Ok, now that I'm finished critiqueing (sp?) the previous build, I'm going to go ahead and throw one of mine up for critique. The idea is that this guy is supposed to be an evil Priest that mercilessly disables and slays his opponents with his dual kamas, and has powerful magic and undead servants to back him up.<br><br>It goes like this:<br><br>10 Rogue/12 Monk/18 Cleric<br><br>You can lvl up in pretty much whatever order you want since all 3 classes are moderate BAB classes and since I'm not taking any PrCs, none have prerequisities. One thing I should mention is that the combo of classes at lvl 20 should be multiples of 4 (12/4/4 for example), and if you don't want an XP penalty you will want to raise one class higher than the others, and keep the lower 2 classes within one lvl of each other.<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Lawful Evil; if PvP then Lawful Neutral<br>Domains: War and Trickery<br><br>Starting Stats:<br><br>Str: 14<br>Dex: 16<br>Con: 14<br>Int: 10<br>Wis: 14<br>Cha: 8<br><br>Ending Stats:<br><br>Str: 14<br>Dex: 20<br>Con: 14<br>Int: 10<br>Wis: 20<br>Cha: 8<br><br>Important Skills:<br><br>Discipline: 20<br>Heal: 43<br>Concentration: 25 (enough for Imp. Combat Casting)<br>Tumble: 40<br>Spellcraft: 40<br>Use Magic Device: 43<br><br>Note that all these are class skills with the exception of Discipline. I would consider taking Epic Skill Focus: Discipline as one of my feats rather than Epic Spell Penetration, or maybe Armor Skin, if I was on a PvP world. I would also try to get Epic gloves of Discipline.<br><br>Feat Progression (by lvl):<br>1) 2-weapon fighting, ambidexterity<br>3) weapon finesse<br>6) toughness<br>9) weapon focus: kama<br>12) improved 2-weapon fighting<br>15) extend spell<br>18) combat casting<br>21) Improved combat casting<br>24) Epic Prowess<br>27) Epic Weapon Focus<br>30) Armor Skin<br>33) Spell Penetration<br>36) Improved Spell Penetration<br>39) Epic Spell Penetration<br><br>In addition, I get the following feats as bonus feats: Monk AC bonus, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist, Deflect Arrows, Knockdown, Improved Knockdown, Flurry of Blows, Evasion, Improved Evasion, Monk Speed, Purity of Body (immune to common disease), Wholeness of Body (pfft), Ki Strike, Diamond Body (immune to poison), Diamond Soul (SR equal to character lvl + 10), and lastly, but not least, Crippling Strike, which I get at my 10th lvl of Rogue.<br><br>For those not familiar with Crippling Strike, it does 2 points of Str damage every time you successfully connect with a Sneak Attack. Considering that this character can get up to 9, maybe 10 attacks per round (5 with primary hand, 2 with off hand, +1 for haste, +1 for flurry of blows, +1 for Divine Power), it should be possible to knock an opponent's Str down to nothing in no more than a few rounds.<br><br>Of course, I have a few tricks in order to make sure I get sneak attacks. I plan to buff up with Improved Invis. (Trickery Domain) before every battle, and if that gets dispelled, I can always cast Darkness. If that doesn't work, I can attempt to knock my opponent down using Imp. Knockdown, at which point I should be able to hit him every time.<br><br>At lvl 40 my nekkid AC should be around 30 (10 base, +5 from Dex., +5 from Wis, +2 from Armor Skin, +8 from 40 Tumble). My unbuffed AB, wielding normal kamas, should be around 31 (25 base, +5 from Dex, +1 from Weapon Focus, Epic Weapon Focus, and Epic Prowess, -2 from dual-wielding). I should have 7 attacks/round and get 5d6 sneak attacks.<br><br>As for buffed #s or health, I'm not sure yet what they will be at 40. I have created this guy and gotten him up to 16 or so in HotU, and so far he's been tearing through everything without too much trouble. The one problem I find with this guy is that although his AB is quite decent when fully buffed, it seems somewhat lacking when unbuffed. Still, I have a suspision (sp?) that once I get this guy up to 40 he will be quite the dastardly bastich.<br><br>Anyway, feel free to tear this apart and make suggestions. All I would ask is that you try to be constructive in your criticism. Thanks.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bromium on 10/12/07 20:00</span></i></p>

Is there something im missing? I can only seem to get 5 attacks per round on this build (3 prim, 2 off). With Divine Power +1, Haste +1, and Flurry +1. So if someone can tell me what im doing wrong here or is this build not right.

To get the monk attack schedule you must:<br><br>-Wield a kama or go unarmed in the primary hand<br>-Wear robes or other 0 AC Base clothing<br>-Not hold a shield in the offhand<br>-Have at least 1 monk level in the build (the obvious)

How in the world are you getting Diamond Soul? Not showing up on my end. Although I'm liking this build because of its multiple ways to beat ya down.

You are selling the build's ac short by 2 (monk innate at levels 5 and 10), I think.<br><br>I like the build although I have avoided the monk/rogue combo because of the duplication of talent as far as evasion goes.  If you live in a dev crit-free PW, this could be a very effective damage multiplier.  <br><br>The attacks per round are legit, the person posting above didn't account for your. . . monkness.  Monkosity?  I think I like monkosity.  <br><br>Cheers.

It's an old build post guys.  Bad213Boy was asking why he wasn't getting 5 attacks PLUS the offhand attacks.
