I don't know if this has been debated in the general forum.<br>When I tested the build I found the following attack table:<br>Buffed AB, two mundane kamas with flurry and haste (from a scroll/potion/item):<i> +54/+51/+48/+45/+42/+56/+51/+46/+54/+49<br> </i><br><br>The first 5 are the normal monk progression: +54/+51/+48/+45/+42/ <br><br>The next 3 are from Divine power, Haste and Flurry:<br>+56/+51/+46/ <br>They are all added at the highest AB when alone. But when you use them together you get a -5 penalty for each extra attack. Note also that they start at a +2 higher AB than the first attack in the round.<br><br>The last 2 are from the off hand attacks:<br>+54/+49<br>The AB penalty of the second off hand attack is -5 as in the ITWF feat description, not -3 as the character sheet says.<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan

That's because the offhand weapon never counts Monk AB progression, kama or not, it works the same.

And you get the same attack table if the off hand weapon is not a kama, as long as it's a small/tiny weapon and you have the same set of weapon foci in both weapons.<br><br>What surprised me more was the middle part, where you get attack penalties on the DP/Haste/Flurry combo.
