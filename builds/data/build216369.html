<b>Playable 1-40 in PvE.</b><br><br>This is the result of a thought I've had rattling around inside my head for a while... too late at night for a story though.<br><br>Half-Elf, Non-Lawful<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 17<br>Con 14<br>Wis 10<br>Int 12<br>Cha 11<br><br>1  Barb (1): Weapon Finesse*<br>2  Barb (2):<br>3  Barb (3): Weapon Focus (Longbow)<br>4  Barb (4): +1 dex<br>5  Barb (5):<br>6  Barb (6): Point Blank Shot<br>7  Bard (1):<br>8  Arch (1): +1 dex<br>9  Arch (2): Rapid Shot<br>10 Arch (3):<br>11 Arch (4):<br>12 Arch (5): +1 dex, Called Shot*<br>13 Arch (6):<br>14 Arch (7):<br>15 Arch (8): Toughness*<br>16 Arch (9): +1 dex<br>17 Barb (7):<br>18 Barb (8): Blind-Fight*<br>19 Barb (9):<br>20 Barb (10): +1 dex<br>21 Barb (11): Epic Weapon Focus (Longbow)<br>22 Barb (12):<br>23 Barb (13):<br>24 Barb (14): +1 dex, Great Dex 1<br>25 Barb (15):<br>26 Arch (10):<br>27 Arch (11): Great Dex 2<br>28 Barb (16): +1 dex<br>29 Barb (17):<br>30 Barb (18): Great Dex 3<br>31 Barb (19):<br>32 Barb (20): +1 dex<br>33 Arch (12): Great Dex 4<br>34 Arch (13):<br>35 Arch (14): Great Dex 5<br>36 Arch (15): Epic Skill Focus (Intimidate)*<br>37 Arch (16):<br>38 Arch (17):<br>39 Barb (21): Terrifying Rage<br>40 Bard (2): +1 dex<br><br>Skills - The last bard level is to end with max Discipline, Tumble, Spellcraft, and UMD.  Be sure to max Intimidate on level 39.<br><br>Ending Vitals:<br>32 Dex<br><br>+51 AB with mundane longbow, +9 damage from AA<br><br>29 AC<br>520 max hp (not raging)<br>Fort 25, Ref 32, Will 19<br>4/- Damage Reduction<br><br>Greater Rage 6/day for +6 str, +6 con, +3 will save, -2 AC<br>Terrifying Rage Save DC 52<br><br>Pros - Good hitpoints and overall defenses for an archer.  Terrifying rage makes the enemy keep their distance and limits their fighting back.  Able to fight in melee with an AB of 40 using a finessed weapon.  Rage bonuses allow the effective use of mighty +3 bows.  UMD.<br><br>Cons - Mediocre AB and damage for an arcane archer. Terrifying Rage is late in the build.  Doesn't get the prereq feats to capitalize on high dex by taking epic dodge or self-conceal.<br><br>The FAQ:<br><br><b>Q:  So what's the big idea you had that made you do this build?</b><br>A: I wanted to make a barbarian/AA because I wanted to combined Terrifying Rage (a feat that prevents many enemies from attacking you) with effective ranged attacks.  Also, I've been messing around with AA in general lately.  <br><br>The usual rage bonuses also synergize nicely with the character, boosting the low will save, adding hitpoints, and making Mighty a worthwhile quality on your bows.<br><br><b>Q:  Why not take more epic Rage feats then?</b><br>A: I would have liked to, but terrifying rage is the only one I could qualify for in this build.<br><br><b>Q:  What about the level progression?  Why is it that way?  Couldn't you get 1 more AB by going pure Barbarian to 20?</b><br>A:  Yes I could have, but I wanted the character to be playable as an archer from as early on as possible.  It's probably very possible to go pure barbarian to 20, but I think it's more playable as is.<br><br><b>Q:  Why Bard?  Why not wizard or sorcerer?</b><br>A:  Because Bard gets tumble, spellcraft, and UMD as class skills.  You can make a wizard version of this build with Elf as the race if you really want but I think that for powergaming purposes Bard comes out on top.<br><br>Wizard would free up some base stat points, and have more skill points at the end probably, but wouldn't have as many truly useful skills to spend them on.<br><br><b>Q:  I'll get level 1 bard spells... at level 40.  What do you suggest?</b><br>A:  Protection from Evil is by far the best level 1 spell.  Take that.  Otherwise, it doesn't matter.  Identify is reasonably useful to identify lower level items and potions or scrolls in the field without a trip to town or putting points into Lore.  By the time you get the spells most of them won't be useful anymore, and you'll have too few caster levels for shorter duration buff spells to be meaningful anyway.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 10/14/05 13:49</span></i></p>

But dropping con shortens the duration of the rage which I think can be a problem.

Okay I am not sure but i do know the rage lasts a number of rounds equal to your con modifier (modified by rage etc). Maybe it is something plus the modifier, say 5 + modifier, there I am unsure. But I dont think a barbarian should have con lower than 14.

Not sure how it is in NwN, but in PnP it's 3 rounds + Con modifier including Rage bonus. NwN might be different.

Yes, that's what reads in the Barbarian Rage script's commentary, too.
