<b>Disciple of Mask</b><br><br><b>Playable from 1 to 40 PvM</b> (I think he also can PvP)<br><br>I have been playing this character lately (A customized version, but almost the same), and despite the fact he could be slighly optimized for a (Ftr10/Cleric17/Rogue13), he performs incredibly well (It is by far my favourite build). He could also get Devastating Critical (By trading his 2 last great str for overwhelming and devastating critical and lightining reflexes for great cleave), but this build was for a world with banned dev-critical.<br><br>*Edit* I performed a search on the list (Hey! That search engine works good!) and it looks like this one isnt the only str based ftr/cleric/rogue. At least this one is focused on being playable.

This character can score LOTS of sneak attacks on his opponent, the sneak attack damage isn't high, but disabling him with crippling strike is incredibly useful, as his discipline drops (more knockdowns), same with his AB and melee damage.<br><br>Concentration 43(44)<br>Discipline 42(51)<br>Open Lock 33(32) //Add trickery domain powers on top of this and you will have no problem<br>Disable Trap 33(35) //Add trickery domain powers on top of this and you will have no problem<br>Spellcraft 43(45)<br>Tumble 40(39) <br>UMD 41(40) //You can use anything you want to <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  .<br><br>Max Hitpoints: 404<br>Saving Throws:<br>Fort: 24 (33 vs spells)<br>Will: 24 (33 vs spells)<br>Refl: 19 (28 vs spells)<br><br>AB with mundane weapon: 40<br>Buffed AB: 40 (unbuffed) +1(Or 2 from bull's str) +5(Divine favor) +3(Divine power) +2(battletide) +1(prayer) +5(Greater magic weapon) = 57 AB With a mundane weapon, 47 If you are using improved expertise (It is still a decent AB, IMHO)<br><br>Naked AC: 10(base) -1(dex) +2(armor skin) +8(tumble) = 19 [+8(Plate armor) +3(Tower shield) = 30]<br>Buffed AC: 30 (Unbuffed) +5(Barkskin) +4(Undeath's eternal foe) +5(Magic vestments -armor) +5(Magic vestments -shield) +5(Shield of faith) = 49 AC with mundane armor (Lasts 18 rounds, then drops to 45)<br>Self concealment is added on top of this AC <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  , but if you still have problems with your 49AC you can enter improved expertise, raising it to a not-so-bad 59AC<br>Remember you have 8dex, a cat's grace potion or dex-boosting items will grant you 2more AC and even better reflex saves.<br><br>Damage: 1d6(weapon) +9(str modifier) +[5d6 sneak attack]<br>Buffed damage: 1d6(weapon) +9(base str) +1(Or 2 from bull's str) +5(Magical: divine favor) +2(Magical: battletide) +1(Slashing: prayer) +1d6 +10(Fire: Darkfire) = 2d6 +28 per hit +[5d6 sneak attack]<br><br>For scoring sneak attacks:<br> - Knockdown your adversary.<br> - Darkness + Ultravision (My favourite).<br> - Hammer of gods.<br> - Storm of vengeance.<br> - Use any of your multiple summons for distracting them.<br><br>If you are going to fight a boss with LOTS of minions you can do it really good by setting up a zone with darkness, storm of vengeance, blade barriers and creeping doom, anything daring entering that zone will suffer greatly, and you will deal with the boss without disturbances <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  .<br><br>It could be possible to drop fighter to 10 and cleric to 17 in order to get rogue to 13 and trade 1 bonus fighter feat for 1 bonus rogue feat and 2d6 sneak attack damage. But this build was designed for being playable all the way to 40 and it is enough solid this way (The same reason comes for the power attack + cleave, it is for helping on early levels).<br><br>About the scimitar... I recomend it because the critical range, and, if fully buffed, you will score lots of criticals where all the magic damage but darkfire will be multiplied, that means a good ammount of extra damage per round. I played this character using a greatsword (The damage output is really good with a greatsword), but I think he might be more efficient with a one-handed + shield combo.<br><br>He has a 20% xp penalty through most of his life, but I found it worth the character.<br><br>I hope you like it.<br>_________________<br>HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh.

Fernando,<br><br>Nice solid-looking build. I especially like the early advancement: Weapon Spec by level 4, Improved Knockdown by 9, then Extend Spell at 12.<br><br>The only suggestion I would make is to swap Armor Skin with Epic Prowess. Since Epic Prowess stacks with Epic Weapon Focus, I would like to see the character having the extra AB earlier, and then finishing off with the bonus to AC from Armor Skin.<br><br>Nice build!<br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br><i>"Where there is life, there is hope." - Grover</i>

True, good point, about switching Epic Prowess for Armor skin. It always depend on what kind of world you play, where I used him it was more important to have High AC than High AB.<br><br>About taking fighter at level 1, it is true that taking rogue gives a lot of extra skillpoints, but I think this build doesn't need them, and it helps a lot making him being strong from level 1.<br><br>It is fairly tweakable (tweaks are welcome), anyway the purpose was that, making him strong and playable during all his life to level 40 and, once there, making him to be strong enough.<br><br>P.S: He could also be dwarf, forgetting about Thoughness (your +2 Const compensates that and also gives 1 to fortitude saves), he will have +2 to all saves (what is nice), and you wont have to sacrifice much from skills (get less untrap-unlock or start as rogue).<br>_________________<br>HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh.
