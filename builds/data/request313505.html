Folks, I have a conundrum I was hoping all you uber builders can help me out with. <br><br>I have a bloke on a server that seems to be unbeatable and I need some build advice to be able to beat this pumpkin-head into the ground.<br><br>She is a Cleric18/Ranger5/Rogue7 (30 is the max level we can achieve on this server)<br>Attributes:<br>S 8<br>D28<br>C13<br>I16<br>W20<br>Ch10<br><br>Feats: <br>Blindfight<br>Dual weld<br>Epic Skill focus: Discipline, Spot<br>Epic Toughness<br>Evasion<br>Extend Spell<br>Favored Enemies: Elves<br>Knockdown<br>Skill Affinity: Spot<br>Uncanny Dodge II<br>Weapon Finesse: Kukri<br>Weapon Focus: Kukri<br><br>Skills:<br>Concentration 35<br>Discipline 52<br>Hide 44<br>Move Silently 44<br>Open Lock 10<br>Pick pocket 10<br>Set Trap 10<br>Spellcraft 35<br>Spot 64<br>Tumble 39<br>UMD 12. <br><br>Her tactic is pretty much the same tactic every time – Appear from the shadows, knockdown, beat you silly with the dual welding kukris with sneak attack and crit damage. Rinse and repeat. <br><br>The limitations for the build: As I said, I can only go to 30th level. In addition, I need some cleric levels for the specific ‘group’ I need to be affiliated with. And lastly, I can’t be lawful. Oh, and I must take three levels in any class I choose. <br><br>The problem I have is I can’t see her until she is on top of me and when she is, the spam knockdown eventually wins and I am dead. Any class combinations, any help would be greatly appreciated. <br><br>DSC

I'm not really an expert, but, if it is really only the knockdown spam and stealth that's getting to you, then I suggest either a monk with high wisdom, strength, spot or listen, and discipline or a high wisdom druid who focuses on shifting and spot or listen and discipline skills.<br><br>Just wait for a reply from the masters.<br>_________________<br>I smite thee with all of the power of Tempus!<br><br>(swings mace, hits, floating number six)<br><br>WAH?!?!? 6 DAMAGE?!?!?!

As was asked in the other thread, what spells are changed, particularly True Seeing?

true seeing is changed to rounds instead of turns and as stated earlier, I can't take a lawful build, thus no monk. <br><br>Imp Invis, and other select buff spells are reduced to rounds instead of turns. I was working on a cleric/WM or a cleric/ranger build to try and maximize the counters to knockdown and build up my discipline. But that is as far as I have gotten, just looking to spit ball here on some other type builds. <br><br>DSC

Hmm.  What's the rest timer?<br><br>Using a 27 sorcerer/3 cleric, armored with Divine Shield, and Extended True Seeings to last five and a half minutes each might work (2 or 1 cleric would be preferable, but I think you'd need 3, aye?).<br><br>Could go Unarmored as well, I can try to cook something up if you'd like.

First, How did you get the build from the dude?  LOL  jk<br><br>If its crits that are hitting you, an OPTION could be cleric16/bard4/pm10.  THat way you get crit immunity.  <br><br>In this cae, i would suggest only 16 wisdom.  WHAT!  You arent building a pvm tank, you are attempting to do a pvp tank.  What good are the higher cleric spells for that when you need AB!  Go High str, maybe start with Halforc to get 18 to 20 str at the start.    <br><br>Its a bit unusual, but it could work.

What MM said, except may as well go sorc27/BG2/Cleric1 and get the saves...  Might be a bit tough on the feats though.  In any event, if you're lookin' to take out a specific build, sorc generally does the trick.

Considering the person he's worried about fighting, I'm guessing the extra feat (and lack of need to take Cleave) will probably be better.

ah crap!  now you've done it!  Given an Uber build, but the only problem is, its an exalted sorc (basically).

Ah, my bad.  Conveniently forgot the three level rule.  Might still be worth it though.  Sorc24/BG3/cleric3?  Dispellability shouldn't be much of an issue.  Spell duration may be, but a few more rounds aint the end of the world.  Feats are tight, but it can be done.  I dunno.  It's a toss up.

Wasn't thinking dispellability as much as dispelling the enemy cleric with Mord's.  Changes it from a 95% chance to a 80% chance.  Cleric will be crying either way, though, so no big deal.<br><br>But yeah, if playing Evil ain't an issue and you're concerned about saves at least a decent amount of the time, it would be a good option.
