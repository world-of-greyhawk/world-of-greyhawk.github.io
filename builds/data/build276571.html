Slashing and Avenging with the Roar of a Lion PvP and PvM (1-40)<br><br><b>LIONHEART (Wildwood Crusader)</b><br><b>By (in alphabetical order) Deborah “Tyr” Templar, Grimnir77, and Tattoed Monk</b><br><br><br><i>Concept: The King who Roared</i><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; Lionheart, being Richard I (or King Richard), a noble knight and gallant soldier, and rightful ruler of England who was also a crusader; he left his kingdom temporarily in the care of his relative, John (Sorcerer King, Wildwood Prince: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "272583", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> ) while he sought answers and justice to alleged crimes committed abroad, meanwhile leaving his own kingdom open to crimes committed against his subject by John and his own system of Sheriffs (and especially the Sheriff of Nottingham, Wildwood Tyrant: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "276570", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> ). <br><br>Controversial yet charming, Lionheart endured much back-stabbing and constant threats, which he faced with the pride and persistence of a lion. He also enjoyed many an exciting adventure, was extremely well educated, and able to converse in many languages, but his true passion was that of a soldier, excelling in military matters from a very young age; his main concern at all times was that of his kingdom’s national security (and thus the comfort of his subjects), which was constantly under threat from foreign powers. For the people, then, Lionheart endured much personal hardship, including being kidnapped and held against his will by foreign powers. He had loyal supporters such as Robin Hood, (as a “true-to-life” plate-wearing knight, in Wildwood Warrior: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "270518", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> , or in accordance with the tales, as an archer, in the Wildwood Outlaw: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "271724", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>  ) and his merry band of the woods, including Alan A. Dale, the Wildwood Minstrel: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "270842", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> , Will Scarlett, the Wildwood Mercenary: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "270836", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> , and last but by no means least, the infamous Lady Marian, a high borne intelligent noble who cared deeply about her people,   <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "271264", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> (Wildwood Maiden). <br><br>Lionheart was able to escape his ordeal, no worse for the wear, being bent and determined on nothing more than returning to his throne and rescuing his kingdom from the evil forces who had taken over during his absence. England, he vowed, would be freed from her nightmare, and her enemies would suffer the full extent of his divine wrath. He was, after all, Lionheart, and his enemies would hear him roar. </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br><i>The Build: </i><br>While not the first melee’r to combine ranger/paladin in some form or fashion (there being four in spirit, all nice PvM builds and worthy of mention (ranger? paladin? really, what’s not to love!), to which links to all are below); this is the first of its kind, according to the pulse, to combine Ranger bane (vs. all player races) w. the whole range of paladin buffs, incl. holy sword, and is therefore quite unique; further, and in addition, we add a double weapon focus, incl. the two-bladed sword (for double bangs on all of your buffs, including the holy sword), hence nothing short of powerful damage output – i.e., w. 6 apr (7 hasted), Lionheart dishes up to 330 damage (about 400 vs. evil) per round (even more hasted), while dispelling buffs on – and quickly slicing through – enemies like there’s no tomorrow.<br><br>In between “power modes” (during which defense is not an issue when dual-wielding, since most enemies simply don’t live long enough to hurt you), he enjoys the bastard sword, which enables plate use (for AC, and can also equip a shield if desired, hence a nice defense as any other str-based melee build, only with more options, such that neither offense nor defense has been overlooked). Coupled with nice saves (bolstered by paladin immunities, the full range of ranger and paladin spells, and divine grace) and also decent/good HPs, Lionheart is a solid warrior. The main draw-back of this build is that he is a warrior/melee’r–hence, no access to UMD; while this may be frustrating to some (in terms of versatility), it is not really a draw back per se, so far as Lionheart has innate casting (ranger + pally, and entitlement also therefore to all pal/ranger scrolls), can bolster his own saves, and has a really nice AB/damage all his own (which he also can self-buff). As such, Lionheart is a solid melee’r, in all environs, and nothing short of divinely powerful when buffed.

Heh, we could've gotten ourselves better saves by moving a point from CHA to INT without losing much. 43 skillpoints, some into Spellcraft. Ah well.

Indeed, it is! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   ARRR <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  <br><br>Yeah, drop cha 1, and even out int. instead, 43 more skill points for upping spellcraft so that we get another +2 all saves vs. spells (in fact, if pump in 12 cross-train points, for a total 21(23), w. 23 points left-over for pumping heal or as you want, w. the ability thus to pick up yet another +1 all-saves vs. spells w. something as simple as a potion or other int. item, for a total +5 vs. spells: not too shabby at all! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>Another avenue some may prefer, in light of ranger's innate stealth boosting abilities (though spellcraft is preferable, this is Lionheart afterall, and those deadly traps are always nice/practical), is to detrain traps and drop spellcraft down to +1 all saves, and train stealth (hide, m/s) instead - add cats, one.w., camou., trackless, etc. and ... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   In a few of the Hood tales, it was said that Lionheart disguised as the Black Knight met Robin in the woods, where they laid their plans for storming the castle at night under cover of darkness (hence, stealth/took their enemies by surprise), and fully prevailed. <br><br>As to what we'd lose, well, nothing really at all: 1 point of taunt, but so what really: 43(42) w. +6 FEs = 48 (instead of the current 49), bring on +2 Aura and another 3 eagle's (assuming roll/picking up on the straggler), for adj. 53, being the exact same as now, so zero loss. Same is true of div.grace effects (i.e., picking up on the straggler, so no loss there in terms of buffs either). Only thing in fact it would effect would be equip't/capping out our cha. which would cap out div.grace (and smite ab bonus) at +5 instead of +6, but heh, so what: this is, afterall, a bonus (not counting towards the +20 caps), so def. more skills wld be better (for spellcraft keeping traps, highly suggested, or if you want, dep. of preferences etc. players are free to go the sneaky route instead ... heh heh <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>Either way, and yeah, Grim, totally right and bang on, as there's no such thing as too many skills (and just so nice to see on a paladin, too!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Really hope everyone's enjoying the Wildwood series, and slash/smite/roar on ~ Tyr (on behalf of the Wildwood Gang)<br>_________________<br>"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good [people] to do nothing" -- Edmund Burke, Philosopher and Politician (1729-1797)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/20/07 12:56</span></i></p>
