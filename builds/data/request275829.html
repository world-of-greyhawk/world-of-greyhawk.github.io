Which server are you talking about? I'm guessing it's either Dungeon Eternal or Badlands based on the description and my experience, and from what I remember of them it is legally possible to get higher than +5 on some things. But a name would be a very good indicator of how to answer your question.<br><br>If it's either of those servers it will not be possible to get all of those things on one build.

Bromium always makes shifters, nothing new about that, though Dev Crit Barbarian Raging Kobold was certainly not expected when the guy is asking Epic Dodge and Self Concealment.<br><br>Anyway, Self Concealment is also not a very good feat, it's a very big investment (5 feats spent and crazy amount of DEX) and you can imitate the same effect with just casting Improved Invisibility, better just use a scroll since you'll definitely take Rogue for Epic Dodge and you've got UMD already.<br><br>The thing is a Monk/Shadowdancer/Fighter with Epic Dodge and Self Concealment deals pretty much from very little to even less, your damage output is ridiculously low, you probably need something other than EWS if you wish to kill with a dexer on a +5 environment.<br><br>Noticing you can't get a high SR and AB (because that's just not possible man), I see you only want a high AC and AB guy with Knockdown and Epic Dodge, you could pretty much make anything from Fighter / Rogue / Weapon Master to Monk / Cleric / Rogue, maybe you should make again the request? be more specific and forget about SR.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 06/08/07 17:36</span></i></p>

thanks for all the replies everyone. Im playing on antiworld. you start at lvl 10. max is definately +5. The problem there is that if you up against melee types a rogue/wm/fighter combo does really well but as soon as the other team gets a cleric or necro mage its all over. they just pretty much tear everything apart with clerics destruction etc. so what i was looking for was a build that can be used to take out the pesky clerics and mages. just to put an end to their reign of terror. <br><br>thanks again

That server is flooded with casters of course, since it's a PvP only server. With no class-restrictions and max +5 items, and no  perma anything. Just the way i like it. I played there with a caster Cleric and did okay, but believe it or not, I played a Fighter/SD/Rogue too, and it fared very well. AA's is also a popular class in PvP servers and that dude ripped them apart. It ripped apart Dev critters too, of course. Casters was the main beef. I mostly had to put up some traps, or hit with a bow after waiting around a corner. Cleric/Monks is a pest too, but usually must stop to rebuff. Thats when you strike. Mages demand a lot of shooting and running. You have scrolls and traps there. Other than that, if you want an SR build that will be good to run flags with. Actually, it will be excellent. 36monk is nice speed. Nice SR and with 4 paladin a little bow damage vs casters. Lousy AB though.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

I am not sure how to build for antiworld, but how about 35 monk/4 barb/1 wiz? Has enough levels of monk for sr should you go that route, ac from lots of monk with uncanny dodge should something go wrong, damage from high apr and D20 fists and can get decent ts ab. Failing ts ab you can try sneaking.
