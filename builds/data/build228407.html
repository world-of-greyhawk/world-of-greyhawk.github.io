A dragon build which is not too cheesey and gets <b>DS at 28th lvl!</b><br>All the druidical forms available, high caster lvl, penetrates toolset SR, SF feats, monk's attack progression, boni to AC, endurance, deflect arrows, endurance, evasion, plus a little pinch of holy protection and deeper insight from the forces of nature (CoT).<br>This build can easily buff WIS to the cap just with owl's insight, benefitting of a +6 AC, spell DC, stunning fist DC, will saves (and AB with zen archery). STR is easily buffed up via emp. bull's strenght, aura of vitality and blood frenzy, reaching the cap with a lucky roll. You ain't no cleric, so no endless list of buffs but you still have some nice spells to protect yourself from harm.

Drop Epic Reflexes for WF: Unarmed and Epic Prowess for EWF: Unarmed. Will gain you a net +2 to AB in Dragon Shape. If you really want to keep epic reflexes for the evasion, you cold drop Armor Skin or Epic Spell Focus instead (spell DC isn't that high anyway, and you will probably do more damage in combat than by spells). If you drop Armor Skin and ESpF to keep Epic Prowess, you can gain 3 AB.<br><br>Depends on where you prefer to focus - spells or combat damage.<br><br>Nice build!<br><br>TM

I too believed so until I tested, with v 1.66, and WF/EWF do not work. The character sheet shows AB as if the feats worked, but they don't. Only IC: unarmed works. All you've got when shifted is EP, STR boni (+19 AB), +6 dragon claws and -2 AB due to size (huge), and the sheet doesn't show the +6 from dragon claws.<br>Give a look <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225446", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>here</a> for my findings about DS with a cleric/druid/monk build<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Neither WF nor EWF work in DS or in elemental form. You might be induced in thinking they do because the sheet is... messed up basically.<br><br>Let's say you make a build with WF/EWF unarmed.<br> <br>The <b>character sheet</b> will show: BAB +19 STR bonus + 1 WF + 2 EWF +1 EP<br><br>The <b>reality</b> is: BAB +19 STR bonus +1 EP <i>+6 dragon claws</i> - 2 <i>huge size</i><br><br>Let's say BAB= 25. That means:<br>AB (sheet)= 48<br>AB (real)= 49<br><br>If you don't take WF/EWF the sheet will show AB = 45, four points off the mark. The real AB is from tests using combat debugging. I'm pretty sure about it, I tested it extensively with my cleric/druid/monk.<br>BTW the sheet also lies about your AC since it doesn't show the -2 due to size.<br>There's a lot of people believing otherwise, but the sad reality is that <b>WF/EWF:unarmed do not work with shifted forms</b>. IC: unarmed works (for some mysterious reason) as does EP.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

I have another suggestion for making him a bit more playable at lower levels. It gives up the Spell pen feats and only get to caster level 26, so it won't automatically beat a 32 SR, but I don't think the build will be relying on spells once you get DS anyway. DS gets delayed to level 30. What you gain is monk levels pre-epic (for WIS armor bonus, kama weapon focus, monk unarmed attack progression for natural forms earlier, tumble and discipline dumps earlier), 4 CoT levels pre-epic (for the full 6 base attacks per round unarmed, and picks up Disarm/Imp disarm from the bonus feats). Ends up Druid 24/Monk 8/Cot 8. It also gets IKD earlier (before DS). I mostly kept the same feats as you did (including Conjuration foci). You could drop the conjuration foci for spell pen feats if you prefer the penetration instead.

<b>Very well done Tattoed Monk!</b> The Followers of the Dragon are increasing in numbers, I see <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>The result is very good, and even if I miss SP one can always fit in the SP feats (dropping expertise, improved disarm and EP) for a final SP=30+1d20 which gives only a 5% chance of failure vs maximum SR (32). To be noted that creeping doom bypasses SR:evillol: What to choose, really depends on the environment and whether you prefer to always be in DS once you achieve it (in which case forget SP) or to be in human form more often for the thrill of punishing the defilers of nature with wrathful spells. <br>You also have a 5% chance of getting your buffs dispelled, btw.<br>Another thing you miss is the infinite elemental shapes (which have a tendency to better fit through the doors than a dragon <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> )<br><br><br>You forgot to mention that you improved the saves too and got some more skillpoints, which is never bad.<br>A dragon who can knockdown and disarm is a mean machine indeed. Size does matter <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>Nature's Wyrm, altough I didn't state it openly, is the build that achieves DS at the earliest possible lvl. That was my focus. And, luckily, going all druid preepic, doesn't make it tough to lvl.<br>Yours needs just 2 lvls more to get DS but you get so much back (4 att per round, earlier KD/IKD, earlier monk boni, disarm, better saves, more skill points, ...). <br><br>Mate you achieved quite a result there! Had to give up some casting power/efficiency but DS efficiency is indeed improved.<br><br>PS: I can almost imagine nature's wyrm as an elder druid whose disciple is your build, a younger man who has a stronger taste for hand to hand fight and thus concentrates a "little" more on the physical aspects of his role as protector of nature...but really just a little <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>BTW, you should post your build finding it a nice, inspiring name<br><br>Kudos to you!<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

It does not.<br><br>Armor includes armor (chest item), shield (but not offhand weapons AFAIK*) and helmets. However, as all these properties are copied onto your hide item when you're shapeshifting all +X AC, even different types, convert to Deflection bonus (since that's what a hide item has). Thus you do not gain +10 AC by using a +5 armor and a +5 shield. Finally, no shapes merge bracers/gloves/gauntlets.<br><br>AFAIK <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>* = I mean that offhand weapons never merge yet a shield in the slot does. If you merge armor you don't merge your main hand weapon.

I have nothing to add to either build. I think both of them are great. I'm going to build one of each b/c I think they are so incredibly thought out.

The main limitation is the AB, which tops out at around 55 fully buffed. In that sense, I think the Order of Jormungandr build is superior thanks to the powerful Cleric buffs. This one isn't bad, and does mature earlier. It will do very well in low-medium magic worlds, but may be outclasses by regular melee builds in high magic worlds where they can get their AB and AC higher.<br><br>TM

I tested this build (Kail's not TM's) in The Arena of Champions mod lastnight. I have also tested the Dragon Kin listed in the Epic Character Build (ECB) found <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_builds.html" target="_blank">here</a> as well.<br><br>Kails build did quite well vs the Death Wurm but when I got to the Balrog Lord he got hit more often than the one found on the Epic Character Build page although his AC was higher than the ECB ones. (Has anyone else here tried The Arena of Champions mod?)<br><br>I'm going to continue with these character build test until I find one that can defeat the Balrog Lord. So far I have yet to find one build to do this. Most of the builds I have tried, die at the Death Wurms challenge. Only a Dragon Kin has been able to defeat him and unlock the Balrog Lord for the next challenge. That includes the ECB characters.<br><br>Just thought that you would be interested to hear about this build testing.

The Drakon Kin aka Puff the Magic Dragon (v.3 IIRC) is an impressive build. I'm curious about what this Balrog Lord is like.

I will give that one a shot too.

Best I can tell he is fashioned after the balrog in the first LotR. The one Gandalf fought for 30 days and nights. He has no weakness'.<br><br>Read the players guide to that mod. Its really helpful getting to know the mod. Its merely a build tester but its fun b/c it has a deathmatch in it where when you defeat one monster it unlocks the next one on the list. There is a holy war you can unlock also. My best so far is defeating the death wurm. Not good enough to unlock the holy war.<br>_________________<br>Tathar Longbow, Warden

I fought with the Order of Jormundgandr in the Arena, the Death Wurm I got rid off without any buffing at all, just plain base DS, for the Balrog I buffed up (since it seemed so tough from what has been said) then shapechanged into red dragon and the fiery demon got his butt kicked so hard he won't be able to sit down for a long while. I would have probably beaten him to death without buffs too. I'll test later with Nature's Wyrm<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Tested Nature's Wyrm too in the Arena and it did well vs the Death Wurm and had a tough fight vs the Balrog Lord. The Death Wurm can be beaten even without buffing, the Balrog Lord required buffing and only after a prolonged fight where I spammed IKD I eventually nailed him down. <br><br>Nature's Wyrm surely misses the AB/damage buffs of the Order of Jormundgandr and so needed much more time to defeat the Balrog, and prolonged fights mean also your buffs/protections begin to fade, which is something you wanna avoid.<br><br>Summing up: the Order of Jormundgandr rules, its capacity to buff up through both cleric and druid spells is awesome, so much as to make it a formidable build even unshifted. Nature's Wyrm is a powerful build anyway, but less than the Order altough definitely more iconic... and a little less cheesey too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>The Arena it's a fun module, guess I'll try to unlock the other monsters too.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

The one after the Balrog is tough. I tried it with the Jormungandr build (actually, I modified it slightly - I dropped Expertise and the SP feats for Disarm/Imp Disarm, and Combat Casting, and the Epic SP for ICC). Fully buffed he had about 70-73 AB (depending on how lucky he got with empowered buffs), and about 87 AC. I was only hitting the thing on 20's, and it has fast regeneration and a LOT of DR (I was going 2d6 +23 +2 +3 +4 for a total of 34-44 per hit, but only around 6 was getting though - I guess his DR is around 30-35). It was hitting me fairly often for something like 50-100 per hit (I had 1133 HP, he took me to half pretty quick). It had high enough SR that none of my spells were affecting it (granted I dropped the Spell Pen feats, but I doubt 6 more would have helped....). I never got it past barely injured.<br><br>TM

I tried the one after the Balrog Lord too with the Order and it was easy enough. I think you guys do not use all the buffs you've got cause the fight was not that hard to me.BTW the DR is +10/25 , it hits hard when it does but you've got DR spells too from your druid spell list plus regeneration. Spamming KD is very useful. Also it really takes me a couple of real time minutes to buff up, just to give you an approximate list of buffs I use:<br><br>Bull's STR<br>Endurance<br>Aura of Vitality<br>Blood Frenzy<br>Owl's Wisdom<br>Owl's Insight<br>Bless<br>Prayer<br>Aid<br>Battletide<br>Barkskin<br>Magic Vestment/Shield of faith (only one is useful if fighting in DS since they do not stack in DS)<br>Stoneskin<br>Greater Stoneskin<br>Aura vs Alignment<br>Regeneration<br>Monstruos regeneration<br>Spell Resistance<br>Energy Buffer<br>Haste<br><br>and I still have to use<br>Improved invisibility (50% less hits!!!)<br>Darkness<br>Ultravision<br><br>all spells cast empowered/extended as appropriate.<br>Man I need more quickslots <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  <br><br>Nature's Wyrm has inferior buffing capacities so it should have a harder time. If I had more free time I'd test all the module with both build, for now I'll be happy of making a couple of fights every now and then.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 02/04/06 19:13</span></i></p>

Stoneskin stacks with Greater Stoneskin?   I never knew that.  How does that work out?

AFAIK they just overlap, meaning that when one gets depleted you still have the other up to soak damage. The one taking the hit first should be Greater Stoneskin since it has a higher protection value. Something like premonition and GS.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

From what I've seen, the one you cast first is used up first.<br><br>So I cast Prem, GSS, SS in that order.<br><br>-pc

A quick note to those that don't know it. In Dragonform all those three are wasted, the Dragon has better natural resist.

I had the impression that if you get hit by +4 or lesser weapons GS (or premonition or SS) do take the toll. I could be wrong since I'm no expert in DR stacking, if someone knows better, please explain how it works.
