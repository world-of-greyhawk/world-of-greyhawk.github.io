PLEASE!  check the build page.  THere are so many types of builds that are cha pals that it would blow your mind!  What is the best thing to do, instead of asking someone a question like, "i want to make a pal build?"   is to help us out and show that you have done some epic character study and ask a question like "what would you suggest for a new paladin player, a str build or a cha build?"   Believe it or not, the 2 builds are very different in approach.. iow, if you are accustom to playing str builds, the change to cha based melee is differnt.. so take a pal build from the page and go with it!  learn from the experts here..  alot of us are very thurogh and love to answer questions.  <br><br>To maybe help you out abit, look for pal/cot type builds.  Ususally these are using cha.   Another build that you may like (if you have been playin a str based toon) is pal/sorc/rdd10   (sorc cuz bard requires an align shift which isnt always easy).<br><br>Otherwise, go straight pal!  Melee feats, divine might + shield.   Dont take great cleave since dev crit isnt an option for this build.  Take charisma to 25 asap (with gr cha feats) then take extra smite and as many great smite feats that you can or go gr cha feats.  It depends on what you are lookin for.<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    peace

He said he <b>didn't</b> want a CHA based paladin and wants dev crit, so he was pretty clearly asking for the STR type.  There honestly aren't a ton of STR based paladin builds on the site, at least not from a quick glance.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 06/11/05 07:04</span></i></p>

Mostly because a str-based paladin is worse then a fighter/cleric in almost every aspect.

sorry bout that.. have had alot of difficulty reading alot of different things this week.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br>Basically, the str based pallys are the pal/s/rdd10 builds in the build page.  I agree with the others, they are boring as hell to play and are only good for one thing...  but what the hell.<br><br>if you want to make a melee character, dont go pals.  GO fightr/cleric or fightr/wiz.  If you dont go with charisma you are really wasting your time with the paladin lvls and spells, as they get the best charisma bonus that exists..  well one that no other class can even come close to.  But thats just me.<br><br>Oh, and steve, thanks again for pointin out my misreading.  You catch alot of those.<br><br>Peace

thx for the comments <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>i looked on the forums after i started this post and found one suitable idea which was pally/sorc/rdd with dev crit but from your comments i might think about not making a pally or looking into CHA based ones if anyone could point me in the direction of a good already posted CHA pally it would be most appreciated<br><br><br>Thx again <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Strength based fighter/paladins do have an advantage over fighter/clerics, a higher AB.  The AB increasing cleric buffs are: bless, bull's strength, divine favor, aid, prayer, divine power, greater magic weapon and battletide.  They can also use the war domain power and aura of vitality with the strength domain.  Paladins get all of the above except: battletide, divine power, aura of vitality and the war domain power.  Divine power won't do anything for STR paladins, they already have an 18 STR and a full AB.  The STR paladins will also <i>probably</i> have a higher STR than fighter/clerics, they don't have to raise wisdom as high, so they probably already have the aura of vitality bonus.  Paladins get Taunt as a class skill, with an epic skill focus they can pretty much guarantee an effective +6 to their ABs, which will compare nicely to battletide+ wardomain, and can be used ad infinitum.  At the very least they have the same AB and have to cast fewer buffs to get it.  They are also only geting a 13 AB bonus that count towards the +20 limit, while the fighter/clerics are getting 15+divine power and war domain, which might total +20.  So as magic equipment gets better, the STR paladins will pull ahead of the fighter/clerics.  <br><br>In terms of damage, clerics get darkfire, while paladins get holy sword, deafening clang and bless weapon.  So it's comparable.  It's only when you throw healing magic, harm and word of faith into the mix that the clerics look better.  Then again, paladins are immune to fear and disease and, with a 14 CHA, eagle's splendor and aura of glory, can have prettty good saves and a decent divine might and shield. With +5 equipment, I'd say STR fighter/paladins are better warriors than fighter/clerics.  The clerics have other strengths though.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
