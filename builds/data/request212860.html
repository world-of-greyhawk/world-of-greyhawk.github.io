Im looking for a build that the main focus is to disarm a high "AC" npc. Needs to be able to to a punch and able to take a few spells as well. On the server that im currently playing, weapons are very strong and hard to come by. So if i just disarm him first, then I can take the battle alittle quicker. I've seen a bunch of great builds here and plenty of them would work out great. Just looking for some input and Idea's.<br><br>Great forum <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Ps: Im going to use one or two hand axes, cause they are what i've got plenty of at this moment.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.dladventures.com/" target="_blank">DLA</a> <br>I was baptized with the Holy Spirit when I took Him by simple faith in the Word of God....

I'll post some of my builds to get some input. This character is a tool to aid my other charaters. Since the server Im playing on allows for Item tranfer between my characters, I just needed something to help out.

You might want to look at <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "199272", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Skillful Minstrel</a> for some ideas. I didn't build him for what you had in mind, but I think you could easily switch some feats around and boost your STR up. With your Bard Song active, your Discipline would be high enough that you won't be Disarmed or KDed easily and you could also Taunt and Curse Song to drop your enemy's AC by up to 11 points, making it way easier to land your Disarm attempts.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
