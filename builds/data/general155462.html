I'm trying to understand how this works.<br>A 4fghtr/16Cleric will get four attacks per round. How is this calculated?  Is there a way to work out the attacks per round without building the chracter beforehand; and how is it calculater - AB base for the level/dex/etc?  Specifics, if you can, would be appreciated.

That's easy; a Fighter gets 1 AB per lvl, a Cleric gets 3 AB per 4 lvls.  Wizards, Sorcs, and PMs get 1 AB per 2 lvls.  So, with a 4 Fighter 16 Cleric, you would get Fighter 4 = 4 AB + Cleric 16 = 12 AB SO  4 + 12 = 16 AB.  Of course, this only counts for pre-epic, as after lvl 20 you get 1 AB per 2 lvls regardless of what class you are leveling.  <br><br>All Fighter-type classes (Paladin, DD, WM, BG, Ranger, Barb, etc.) also get 1 AB per lvl, and all moderate BAB classes (Bard, Monk, Druid, RDD, Rogue, Assassin, SD, HS, etc.) also get 3 AB per 4 lvls.  There is a table in the back of the manual that shows all this.

Hey thanks for the fast reply.<br><br>Am I right in assuming then:<br><br>1) Taking Weapon Focus and Specialisation adds to the BAB; does this amount get used in the round counting?<br>I think both combined give +3; so I could end up at lvl20 with pure fighter with these two feats and have five attacks per round as in:<br>(without the Weap Focus + Spec) +20/+16/+11/+5<br>(with both and hence +3)        +23/+19/+14/+8/+3?<br><br>2) Am I assuming correct that eg if I have four attacks per round; each attack will increase by one every two levels after lvl20 _regardless_ of class - so taking wizard levels excluding the HP loss I would get the same attack benefit?  <br><br>To take this further so I understand; if I am a fighter16 (hence 16 BAB); I would have a BAB something like:<br>+16/+11/+5<br>then on levelling to lvl17 with fighter:<br>+17/+12/+6/+5?<br>then next level (lvl18) with fighter:<br>+18/+13/+7+/+6?<br><br>sorry if I'm not understanding it correct; just trying to get a handle on these stats.

Good questions! And good answers I'm sure. I was actually wondering about this the other day. I was so desparate that - gasp - I even looked through the manual to find a BAB table (but didn't find one).<br><br>So I'm looking forward to the answers here.<br><br>Thanks,<br>K.

No Feats add to your BAB, they add only to your Attack Bonus - the only way of upgrading your BAB is to level up.

There are basically the following things that determine you total attack bonus. The first is base attack bonus or BAB. This is the bonus that you get during your characters first 20 levels from whatever classes you take. It's been explained above pretty well. You need to add the BAB from each class. If the total is above 6 you get two attacks, and above 11 three and finally above 16 you get the fourth and final attack. The highest BAB possible is 20 and therefor you can at a max have 4 attacks with your main hand per round. The comes your Epic attack bonus. This is basically a +1 for every 2 levels after 20. This doesn't affect how many attacks you get per round. Next you get any attack bonuses from your feats and abilities. Lastly you get any bonuses from weapons or spells.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>
