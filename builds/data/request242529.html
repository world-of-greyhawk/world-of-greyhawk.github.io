(Sorry for all those who posted and helped in my last thread, but the DM's on my server had just decided that Implosion was too strong and would be weakened somehow, so I figured I should try something else)<br><br>--------------------<br><br>I play on a level 30 server:<br><br>-RDD requires 12 levels of Bard or Sorc<br>-Shadowdancer is dissallowed<br>-Minimum of 3 levels per class taken<br>-No perma-haste or true seeing<br>-No immunities beyone 5/- Element on items<br>-No weapons or armour beyond +3 enchantment<br>-IGMS, Implosion, Darkfire are capped badly<br>-Any build must make logical RP sense<br>-Devastating Critical is gone<br><br>I am looking for an Evil build, though I would accept the Neutrals if it is worth it, build-wise. I don't really want a casting-focussed build because I dont like the weaknesses of the arcane casters, and the Cleric was interesting only for Implosion (to me)... the build could include these classes, though not primarily for casting.<br><br>The classes below are the main ones that have caught my eye to take as Prestiges. <br><br>-Blackgaurd<br>-RDD<br>-Palemaster<br>-Assasin<br><br>If you have a good build not including these classes that is great too, these are just the ones I would find interesting to RP. As for the basic classes, I will take most of anything aside from Barbarian or Paladin.<br><br>Some combinations I was thinking (though not limited to) are:<br><br>-Sorc/BG/RDD<br>-Bard/PM/BG<br>-Monk/Assasin<br>-Something/BG/Assasin<br>-Monk/PM/Sorc<br><br>----------------------<br><br>(And many others involving similar structure)<br><br>I would like the build for PvP mainly, though if at all possible it is always nice to have an easy-to-level build... but playability is second to the final PvP product. AB would be very important, and a nice AC is always helpful, though primarily it needs to hit things to hurt them.<br><br>Please, please, please throw me a bone. I suck with builds so I really need some help... if you have any questions about the server or anything that would help you make a build, please post or PM me.<br><br>----------------------------<br><br>Thanks.

At best what kind of AB and AC could I get with such a build? And by best, I mean with only the +3 items and all that stuff that I am restricted to.

I can't believe the big amount of topics by you in the "Build Request Forum" and none ended with a build at the "Epic Character Builds Forum", not saying it's wrong or anything, I'm just rambling about it.<br><br>I do have a build in motion right now... (sort of, unfinished by the way) It's a Monk/Druid/Blackguard, working as Divine Might/Shield in Improved Elemental forms (being feat buffs they can be casted while shifted), I sort of threw it away in the sense I might not make it for the Epic Character Builds Forum, since at level 40, PvP or PvM those shifts don't work very well with DRs, not a bad build in any case, just enough Monk for Tumble (and cheesiness), 20 druid levels with 20 WIS, the rest BG and CHA (BG needed for Divine feats of course), with your 30 level cap and low magical level it will be substantially strong, Monk2/Druid20/BG8 I'd think... not 100% sure if that's how it ends best. Monk gets you Cleave for the BG, which is good, stats go to hell, all 8 except WIS, INT and CHA, start druid 5 as he's crap without shapeshift.<br><br>I just gave an idea, I'm expecting that you can build it, if it is your wish to use it, don't get me wrong, but I think it will be a waste of my time if you don't really like it, and I think you're good enough to make it by yourself, besides, I think I suggested you once that you should make the builds by yourself...

Wow, I can't belive you even want to still play there:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>-RDD requires 12 levels of Bard or Sorc<br>-Shadowdancer is dissallowed<br>-Minimum of 3 levels per class taken<br>-No perma-haste or true seeing<br>-No immunities beyone 5/- Element on items<br>-No weapons or armour beyond +3 enchantment<br>-IGMS, Implosion, Darkfire are capped badly<br>-Any build must make logical RP sense<br>-Devastating Critical is gone</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Although I don't disagree with some of this, the huge list of restrictions here would make me feel like someone else is playing my character and not me, since there's no possible way I could build anything the way I want to.

With all the restrictions on your server, I'd take a a second look at an arcane caster. You say you don't want to do that because of their weaknesses. <br>Tell us what weaknesses you don't like and let's see if there are ways to get around it.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

I didnt say it had anymore weaknesses than other builds, I just dont like the particular weaknesses it has. I dont like having to rely entirely on buffs, I dont like low AB and low HP... even with good Con it is rather low. Its just my preference. I love spellswords but its hard to make a playable one with only 30 levels.<br><br>As for the restrictions, I like them. Shadowdancer was a dumb class with the HiPS, RDD requires alot simply for RP reasons. Not every juvanile sorcerer can just say 'BANG... I'm a Dragon'... and the items keep the use of the DR spells. If you could get beyond +5 then Arcane Casters would be shredded with 0 protection. It also increases the value of GMW and UMD for scrolls to make +5 weapons. I agree with most of it.<br><br>And Thax, I know I've posted alot... I'm terrible! I just really cant think of something that is fun to play which would have good melee PvP results. It is my own pickiness that has landed me in this situation, and I cant get out of it because I'm not the brightest person <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif"> <br><br>AND the DM's have rejected alot of my builds I got from here... thats why I keep re-posting. The Monk/Druid/CoT I was suggested was claimed to be a complete powerbuild with no hope because Druids have no business with Torm, and Monks strive for personal perfection in thier own body, not the body of a Dragon (I argued they still said no) Then my Monk/Druid/Shifter got Perma-Deathed for coming too close to taking over the world <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  And then my Bard/Assasin was put down because the whole reason I liked his RP was not something the DM's liked. The Cleric I just asked for got Implosion Capped... so here I am... again!<br><br>I know, its bad, sorry. But still I ask, if anyone has something that fits the requirements laying around, please share.

I'd find a new server.  If they honestly believe that a CoT means a servant of Torm, then there is little hope.  CoTs are really Divine Warriors, and can serve most deities.  I suppose they also think that Half-orcs don't have any business being Paladins, and that Halflings have no business being Barbarians because their only supposed to be cute and cuddley.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Make a freakin' Fighter/Dwarven Defender, he'll be a guardian of some sorts and that should get him some RP sense, I believe that a DR 21/- (which is the most with a Fighter12/Dwarven defender18 because your max is level 30) will make you supremely strong, better don't try to add CoT, Barbarian or Cleric because those DMs are too bothersome.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;And Thax, I know I've posted alot...
