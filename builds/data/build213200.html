Another novelty build (lol). I aimed for a rogue which was the best at all rogue skills, especially everything to do with traps. Probably best in a party. No SC V. Ranger was chosen for the skill points (I felt I needed them - the more the better!), HP, BAB and two-weapon fighting feats. Ranger also has Set Traps as a class skill. What I need, though, is info on the crafting DCs for traps so I know how far to take it :S. Obviously don't go anywhere near this if you can't use/craft traps.<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: any<br><b>Playable 1-40 PvM</b><br><br>Stats:<br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 18(30)<br>CON: 14<br>INT: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>CHA: 8<br><br>01: Rogue(1): Knockdown, Dodge<br>02: Ranger(1): Favored Enemy: (something), R: (Dual Wield)<br>03: Rogue(2): Weapon Finesse, Ro: (Evasion)<br>04: Rogue(3): DEX+1, Ro: (Uncanny Dodge I), (DEX=19)<br>05: Ranger(2)<br>06: Ranger(3): Weapon Focus: Mace<br>07: Rogue(4)<br>08: Rogue(5): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>09: Ranger(4): Blind Fight<br>10: Ranger(5): Favored Enemy: (something)<br>11: Rogue(6)<br>12: Rogue(7): DEX+1, Improved Knockdown, (DEX=21)<br>13: Ranger(6)<br>14: Rogue(8)<br>15: Rogue(9): Improved Critical: Mace<br>16: Ranger(7): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>17: Rogue(10): Improved Evasion<br>18: Rogue(11): Mobility<br>19: Ranger(8)<br>20: Rogue(12): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br>21: Shadowdancer(1): Epic Weapon Focus: Mace, SD: (Hide in Plain Sight)<br>22: Rogue(13): Skill Mastery<br>23: Ranger(9): R: (Improved Two-Weapon Fighting)<br>24: Rogue(14): DEX+1, Toughness, (DEX=24)<br>25: Rogue(15)<br>26: Rogue(16): Defensive Roll<br>27: Rogue(17): Armor Skin<br>28: Rogue(18): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br>29: Rogue(19): Epic Dodge<br>30: Rogue(20): Epic Will<br>31: Rogue(21)<br>32: Rogue(22): DEX+1, (DEX=26)<br>33: Rogue(23): Epic Skill Focus: Disable Trap<br>34: Rogue(24): Crippling Strike<br>35: Rogue(25)<br>36: Rogue(26): DEX+1, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=28)<br>37: Rogue(27)<br>38: Rogue(28): Slippery Mind<br>39: Ranger(10): Great Dexterity II, Epic Prowess, (DEX=29)<br>40: Rogue(29): DEX+1, (DEX=30)<br><br>Max HP: 402<br>AB (dual-wielding two maces): 39/34/29/24, 39/34<br>BAB: 27<br>Naked AC: 30<br>Sneak Attack: 15d6<br><br>Saves:<br>Fort: 22<br>Ref: 30<br>Will: 19 &lt;-- has Slippery Mind which may help a little<br><br>Skills (431 skillpoints):<br><br>Tumble: 40(50)<br>Discipline: 42(42)<br>Hide: 43(53)<br>Move Silently: 43(53)<br><br>Open Lock: 43(53) &lt;-- 73 with Take 20<br>UMD: 41(40) &lt;-- UMD operates on the modified score in multiples of 5<br>Spot: 28(27)<br><br>Search: 41(43) &lt;-- can detect all default traps including epic<br>Disable Trap: 34(48) &lt;-- with Take 20, can recover all default traps including epic<br>Set Trap: 33(45) &lt;-- with Take 20, can set all default traps including epic<br>Craft Trap: 43(45) &lt;-- I need to know crafting DCs :/<br><br>If you think disabling the traps is enough, use the feat for something else (maybe ESF: Discipline or scrap Epic Will or something as well and take two more Grt DEX).<br><br>Info to optimize the skills taken from the NWN Grimoire.<br><br>Pros:<br>-HiPS<br>-Epic Dodge<br>-Good sneak-attack damage<br>-UMD<br><br>Cons:<br>-Base damage low, harder for you to deal with crit-immune monsters<br>-Mediocre saves<br>-Gets ITWF very late<br><br>Look for: good maces that which help with Crit-immune monsters, DEX boosting items, save-boosting items, a haste item.<br><br>I didn't take exotic for Kukris because with that low STR, most of your damage will be coming from Sneak Attacks anyway so the extra Crit damage will have negligible effect. The only other weapons there you could possibly effectively use from that weapon set are Kukri, Kama (you're not a monk), Whip (might be fun =P) and Shuriken which aren't all that good. Also, if a monster is Crit immune, it is also sneak-immune and the small amount of extra base damage that the maces do will help with this. If you want, you can take Shortswords instead but bludgeoning is the least resisted of the damage types.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 09/20/05 20:21</span></i></p>

Hm <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   - only thing is might have to get Epic Dodge far later if he dropped the initial starting dex or sacrifice other feats to maintain the OK AB. I wanted to make it somewhat playable and the Ranger spells didn't seem all that important. I know you could drop Imp. Crit quite easily (any suggestions on what to replace it with other than move toughness up to pre-epic?) but if you took short swords instead, I'd take it. I figured you could just drop that ESF: Disable Traps (lol - suggestion to take it on Discipline instead <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> ) and max disable traps, ending up with a modified skill of 47 and just quaff a potion, meh.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Jennalee on 09/19/05 07:46</span></i></p>

Thing with the Ranger spells is, you'll only have two spell slots for level one and one for level two received at level 39 - pretty long to wait for self-casted Cat's Grace unless you wanted to wear WIS-boosting items IMO.

good point.  if you wanted to wear a wis amulet +2, then you have a cat's grace and a one with land spell per day, as well as a darkvision and camoflage.  not really tough to find an aumlet like that.  but again, it takes reworking, and as mentioned you must push ED back.  just really an idead for those, whe, like me, enjoy using the ranger abilities.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger."

I have 2 suggestions, and neither one is earth shattering, but if I were to play this build I would do the following:<br><br>1.  Take that 9th Ranger level in pre-epic.  Getting ITWF 5-7 levels earlier can make a big difference.  <br><br>2.  First, delay Skill Mastery for Defensive Roll.  Then drop Improved Critical and move Toughness to that slot, and take Great Dex I at Lvl 24 general feat.  Then, you could  take Epic Dodge at Rogue Lvl 16, and take Skill Mastery(or ESF: Set Traps) at Rogue19.<br><br>Basically, getting Epic Dodge 3 levels earlier is more important that getting Skill Mastery, even for for a Trap Master.  You lose Improved Critical, but that feat wasn't doing a lot for you anyway.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I read somewhere that the Craft Trap DC is the same as the Set Trap DC for the trap in question. I've not seen it disputed, so I'd go by that formula.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Ow <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  I was hoping to scrape more skill points off to put more points into Spot so he'd also excel at scouting somewhat.

You'd lose 20 overall skill points and 3 FE, but you'd gain 6 feats. 2 of those feats could be used for WS/EWS, which will give you +6 damage on all successful attacks and 3 could be used for Ambi, TWF, and ITWF. Much better than the +3 you'd get vs only 3 specific enemy types. You could also juggle your levelling a wee bit to fit in Weapon Finesse at level 2 (instead of level 3) and you'd also be able to fit in a save-booster like Iron Will or Epic Will (just take some of your other feats as the FTR bonus feats and take the save booster on a general feat level). In order to make up the loss of skill points, you'd have to drop a skill (I'd drop Spot) by 20 points though.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Yeah, i know. You will lose 1 AB by doing this, but it is how I would have done it, and how I did it, since I play an exact char like this. Except he is Halfling.<br><br>Hit lvl 13 as Rogue3/Ranger9/SD1. It will get you Hips and ItwF as early as possible, which improves playability. It will only have 2d6 sneak damage, but that is enough to make "normal" damage at that time.<br><br>I dont understand why everyone waits until lvl 21 to grab SD, since playabity increases tenfold the earlier you can get it.<br><br>edit: You will also have 5 attacks each round this way at lvl 13, which will give two attacks in both the first and second attack sequence for a nice number of sneaks when hitting from stealth.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 09/19/05 16:59</span></i></p>

The 1st Revised Edition incorporating the grizzled_dwarflord's suggestions to improve playability (and stay somewhat true to concept).<br><br>Some suggestions if you want to play this:<br>-Move Skill Mastery up even later and take Slippery Mind earlier<br>-Drop two of ESF: Discipline, Epic Fortitude or Epic Will and take two more Great DEX if you feel those are unecessary and get +1 to AB, AC and ref save<br>-If you can endure it, keep it like it was and take 9th level Ranger in Epic and move 12th level Rogue to pre-epic so you'll have one more Fort save in the end<br>-If you can't endure not having HiPS NOW rather than later, take SD pre-epic by shuffling some feats around. You'll lose one AB in the long run (suggested by Grimnir77 - you know when I first twiddled with this, he was a Halfing but got bigger somewhere along the way.
