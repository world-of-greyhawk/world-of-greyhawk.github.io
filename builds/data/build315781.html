It would make more sense to do AA with wiz, but this is fine.<br><br>What IS bizarre is your waste of 4 feats!  You do realize that you are a wizard right?  I assume the wizard can cast haste, no?  Then you just wasted 4 feats for a spell.  Unlike nwn2, where quicken is viable, it has long been understood that quicken isnt that useful, especially auto quicken 3, when there are MANY more useful and viable options available.<br><br>Dont get me wrong, you can do it like this.  It just seems that for the huge investment of 4 feats, for something that is replaced by a spell or perma item (which is fairly commonly used), maybe there is a better option.  It isnt incorrect, just not optimal.<br><br>Oh, and i LOVE the idea of HIPs, epic dodge'n epic warding wizard!  In itself, that makes for one heck of a tough *** dude!

You might want to try ICC and Combat Casting instead of Auto-Quicken, if perma-haste is available then they both do the same thing.  Of course two spells per round when haste is rare is a neat perk.

Your low Death Attack DC aside, wouldn't this be better simply by doing it Wiz26/SD1/Rogue13? You'd be impossible to dispel short of Mord's, get a better AB (if you like), still have EpicDodge, more sneak attack damage + Epic Wizard feat.<br><br>In most cases I find SD10 very wasteful when you have more than 10 levels to spend when you go for ED.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

First of all I fail to see what ED brings to this this build other than lowering spell penetration by somewhere between 10 and 15 and dropping spell DC by 7 or so, effectively crippling the wizard part, indeed making it a shadow of the mage it could have been.<br><br>An AB of 33 is a bit low even for a "spellsword" type of build and since GMW doesn't work on ranged weapons, you have no means of improving the AB other than Cat's and True strike.<br><br>Wiz35/Rogue4/SD1 (or something thereabout) with focus on intelligence will get the job done for you. Enough skillpoints for an arcane rogue type and much better spellpower. You can still melee the mobs MM style. You can compensate for the lack of dex bonus on the stealth skills by taking skill enhancing feats like Stealthy/SF/ESF.<br><br>If you insist on ranged warfare, a Wiz23/AA15/SD2 with int 20, dex 28 and your feat selection will have a ranged AB somewhere between 40 and 44 depending on when you start to take the AA levels. It will also do 8hp more damage on evey hit. But you can't play a halfling that way and still have a legit character <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>A couple of details: <br>You want 41 ranks in UMD to make the corrected score 40. <br>You only want 40 ranks in Tumble because it is the ranks that count towards the AC bonus<br>A tumble higher than 14 makes Spring attack superfluous.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

Without too many changes, I would go Wizard 25 / Rogue 10 / SD 5 instead.  Now your spells can't be dispelled, get more skill points and still keep ED.
