My dear friends, I have challenge for you, I need a new build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I am playing on a server where the critters crit hard. So I need those 10 lvls of pm to crit immune. This means the following:<br>- I need some bard levels to go pm<br>- I need 10 lvls of pm<br><br>Now I need to decide on the other class foor good AB. Just to  clarify: I dont need many attacks, I need to hit. <br><br>It will have to be a DEX char, so I need some epic / uncanny dodge. Evasion or improved evasion is also very welcome. <br><br>And people, I need AC. At least 60+.<br><br>My ideas:<br>- bard / pm / rogue<br>- bard / pm / sd<br>- bard / pm / fighter<br>- bard / pm / aa<br><br>There you have it. Quite a challenge I think. <br><br>Any ideas??<br>Thanks

An AC of 60 is very high without items. If you are looking for a build with items let us know what type you have available (+5, +10 etc.) This would give us a better idea of how to build your build. If its +5 items then its quite easy to get an AC of 60. Without buffs there are perhaps 1 or 2 types of builds that can get the AC that high. <br><br>Syrath

Thanks for your swift response. There are many +5 items where i play, even many +7. But I think using those items I am aiming at 70+ Maybe 80 perhaps?

If you are taking Palemaster for immunity to critical then you are wasting your time from what I can see. <br><br>If you can get your AC to 20 more than your attackes AB then you will be immune to critical. <br><br>A simple Fighter/Rogue build could do this quite easy. As can a Fighter/SD build with the items you have available. <br><br>Have a look at the epic builds and look for the not so dashing swashbuckler. With HotU items only AC was in the 80s.<br><br>Syrath

It's a fine build indeed, but the crits on the server I play at are truly insane. So trust me, I need the pm levels. <br><br>Maybe a bard/pm/aa?

I have an alternate idea for you. Try a monk 9/druid 31. What you can do when fighting those heavy crit hitting enemies is change to elemental form. Not only are you immune to crits, but you are also immune to sneak attacks in this form. Also you have some minor damage reduction. The monk levels will help your AC and enhance your unarmed fighting in elemental shapes.

BASE AC 10 <br>DEX +10<br>Tumble +8<br>Palemaster +6 <br><br>So base = 34 AC , plus your items. <br><br>AB should be +38/35/33 . Dual wield would be main +36/+31/+26 offhand would be +36/+31 before items or buffs. <br><br>As for knockdown , if you are fighting something or someone without discipline you will knock them down and make them open for sneak attack.<br><br>The check for knockdown is based on your attack roll. <br> <br>So if you have +45 AB and roll 15 , they must use discipline to roll against a roll of 60. Once they are on their back you can get stuck in with sneak attacks and when you have 3 or 4 free attacks with +10d6 this can hurt quite a bit.<br><br>Syrath

This makes an excellent character that is nigh invulnerable pretty much no matter what that uses IGMS to dish out dmg.  Though this build may not be the best on some servers, it really shines in the insane mob world of aventia.<br>Also Shifter/Druid builds with Risen Lord/Dragon Form/Rakasha do awesome as well.  Aventia is a lot about the equipment though.

tanassi,<br><br>There are few things that you might want to look out for in the server...<br><br>This is how I find right build for servers that I join.<br><br>-Which character is the dominant of the server, melee or caster?<br>-High or Low Magic server?<br>-Level limitation? (ie; 20 is the max, or 35 is the max, etc etc)<br>-Starting Level?<br><br>There are more though, but those four are what I keep in mind.<br><br>I am assuming in your case, the melee is the dominant since you mentioned that many of them have high criticals. And it would be best to have some critical immunity (but the problem is, any type of rogue can bypass that with death attack).<br><br>If your server is low in magic, then the caster class will likely to be powerful; ie any arcane caster.<br><br>I have no idea about the last two.<br><br>Anyway, since the server is pretty average in magical stuff, +5 and I am assuming that the 7+ is the cap for the server. Many of those would not be effective against druid/shifter build, why? There are many advantages... especially with dragon shape. You get critcal immunity, just the same as some other shapes that you can transform into. But the main advantage of the dragon shape is their breath attack, they can utterly hurt the melee characters with it, the highest I have tested with this type of character is that you can score approx. 200+ damage against 15 AC creature. As for those with 60 AC, you can damage them and never miss with the breath weapon, except that the damage reduces to 12-20 to 15-40.<br><br>But, there is one shape that can withstand +5, that would be either risen lord or demonflesh golem. But, the Demonflesh golem is the first in the damage reduction amount, they can take three different type of weapon damage.<br><br>And if you plan it right, you can get infinite humanoid and epic humanoid shape, which gives you lizardfolk whipmaster. You can use that shape to disarm those with melee weapon, once they are disarmed, you can switch to outsider shape, raskahsa and cast couple icestorm, then switch to dragon shape and use the breath weapon... woot!<br><br>Anuis

For me, it is average... because if you made your own custom module, you can easily make items that would give you 20+ for certain traits, such as AB, etc. And 12+ for abilities. But since that server would be capped at 7, it is close to average, but yet close to high magic. But if you think about it... I go by average of both 20+ and 12+, but since both would be capped at 7+, that would be 14(7+7)/2 = 7 while 20+12/2 = 16.<br><br>That is how I rate the server... others may have different styles of rating them.

I should mention that Aventia has custom scripting for shifted forms, as well as the ability to get past lvl 40 and increase spell damage at later levels.  So unless you understand the changes the server made(I'm not even sure on how shifters were changed) there is no way you can give him a good build.  There are +7/30 items, 10/- magic reduction items, very powerful high lvl items etc etc.  <br><br>Basicly you make a build to take advantage of equipment and for post lvl 40 play.  Not really something in the realm of this guild.  Good melee chars and archers will still work good in aventia but don't even try and touch casters/shifters.

Emrill, Syrath and Evo,<br>Thank you very much for your replies. This topic has exactly turned out as I wished it would: Which char works well on Aventia. <br><br>First of all I found out the chars with 10 lvls of pm will still get post lvl 40 bonusses in the near future. So by the time I am up to lvl 40 I should be ok. <br><br>Actually good arrows can be found quite easily on Aventia, so that wont be a prob. And its true, Ive seen high level AA's shine in melee, as long as they have good items.<br><br>I dont see many shifters in Aventia and there is probably a reason for it. And Aventia is indeed about items, and with shifters you loose a lot of those benefits.<br><br>This all leaves open these 2 builds:<br>Bard 5/ PM 16/AA 19<br>Wiz 24/PM 10/Dwd 6 <br><br>I think they are both execellent and exactly what I need. I am more tempted to go for the AA build because it is good in melee. <br><br>On the other hand, magic really rules aventia, so for the longer term I might opt for the wiz build. <br><br>Can any of you work out that wiz build a little further, so I will know which feats to pick etc? Thanks!<br><br>Great topic!
