Hello all,<br><br><br>     Well I would like a tank and have no idea of how to build one so I thought that I would ask the professionals.  I have no idea what I am looking for either.  This is a tank for a server that I play on with a maximum party size of 4.  It is a medium  magic environment.( well i am lvl six with one charcater and it is hard to find any +1 stuff)  Scrolls and potions can be readily made ( by another of my char.)<br><br>     I am kinda looking forward to tanking early on lvl 5 by the latest.  I would like to be able to help out parties and solo bosses on my own.  I have seen people solo the bosses so i know that it is possible.<br><br>     Some ideas.  Maybee a druid shifter that can cast firewall (I heard this works).  A druid shifter would be fun I think, but can they tank early on?  How bout a melee caster that can use IE(with a tower shield and plate), then read from scrolls, with sneak and crit immune?  This melee caster should be able to open chests and disable traps.  Maybee I am asking too much.=:-?  What about a wall that can still hit enough to kill bosses and then loot.  I will look at any kind of tank build.<br><br>     I would really like to be able to tank Bosses and kill them then loot.  Also to help out other parties people at the same lvl make it through the hard bosses.  I think thats pretty much what I am looking for.  Maybe not possible?  You guys will know for sure.<br><br>Thanks you guys are awesome.<br><br>Krylocke

For a tank that can solo, you pretty much <i>need</i> to be able to use magic. Here are some suggestions for party-only tanks (where you have casters to help you with buffs):<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "247924", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Stalwart Warrior</a> (this one may be able to solo, since he has UMD to use magic items/scrolls/wands/rods).<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "223933", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Rock Warden</a><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "210698", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Dwarven Hammersong</a> (again, UMD, so he may be able to solo).<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "251695", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Ossified Tank</a> (another that could solo).<br><br>For a tankish build that should be able to solo as well, you could try:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "202966", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Master of Resistance</a><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "249429", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Song of the Blade's Edge</a><br><br>or <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "199272", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Skillful Minstrel</a>.<br><br>One last one I'll throw in that I find is very effective when I'm trying out a new server is <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "200316", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Favored of Moradin</a>.<br><br>Of course, there are tons of other tank builds that could work, but these are just a few from my stable. Anything with Cleric should be viable. Just check out the search engine.<br>_________________<br>The <a href="http://www.gustaver.se/nwn/" target="_blank">Build Search Engine</a>.

For solo tanking I would suggest a build heavy on Dwarven defender and with caster levels.  Cleric/DWD/Champion of Torm may do the trick.

I have several Dwarven Defender builds, this two would be the best ones:<br><br>A very playable buffer: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "268568", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Lethal Kama (Cleric 20 / Dwarven Defender 18 / Monk 2)</a>, it's awesome on low magical environments.<br><br>A less playable damage dealer (yeah, it's both damage dealer and tank, but crappy for low levels): <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "265734", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Woodland Dwarf (Ranger 22 / Fighter 4 / Dwarven Defender 14)</a>, this one is better at medium and high magical environments. Actually... this build is pretty bad in terms of playability, but works good at epics.<br><br>You say medium magical environment, but having +1 at level  6 is not a very good description, that is obviously not high but it could be very very low or it might be decent at higher levels.<br><br>A tank from level 5 is a joke, that can't be done, no class is so overpowerful to become a tank from level 5. A Druid / Monk is good and very playable (forget about shifter, use Druid shifts IMO).<br>_________________<br>Join the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Pre-epic Character Builds</a> Guild for builds capped at level 20 and level 30.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 09/08/07 03:05</span></i></p>
