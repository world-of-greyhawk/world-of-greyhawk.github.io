Here's an interesting build someone told me about on my server last night.

A good build. But you have some errors.<br><br>The maximum possible +ab from magical enhancements (not including enhancements on STR) is +20. It will say otherwise on the char sheet, but that lies.<br><br>I thought there'd be a way to get 4 attacks; but unfortunately DwD's stupid requirement of +7 BAB gets in the way (sorc6/rdd4/dwd10 or, if rdd only required 7 lore, sorc4/rdd8/dwd8). If only it was +6 req! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_mad.gif">  <br><br>Also, doing RDD8 pre-epic wouldn't hurt your BAB and would enhance the lower levels a bit (plus you could get your wings at 21!)<br><br>~ Lock.<br>_________________<br>"Life builds you up just to tear you down." - 3rd Strike<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Lockindal on 07/30/04 23:41</span></i></p>

So the maximum AB anyone can ever get is +20? Then what about all of those Epic builds the Bioware posted? I thought a good number of them used True Strike on top of stat and magic bonuses.<br><br>Also, there is more reason behind the 6RDD before 20th. You have to be 5th level sorc minimum to open up RDD, so you may as well take 6th level to get the +1BAB and get the +1 to all saves at 6th. And RDD4&amp;5 do not add a high enough BAB for the Dwarven Defender class. So you need exactly 6 levels of RDD--which in turn also gives you a +1 to all saves. In the end - you wind up with the highest possible Saves and BAB for this class combination which is +15.<br><br>I try to build practical characters that can actually survive to 40th level and that other players would use. None of that, "take one bard level at 37th to max out tumbling and spellcraft." If you could make it that high without those skills, you more than likely don't need them.

There is no "5 levels sorc min" for RDD, though given, that with your class choices you have no core class to fill in for the first four levels.

I could be wrong but isn't the max number of PrC levels before L20 10?  In this case you would need to take L10 S then L10 RDD and the final 20 levels DD (or better 2 levels of Sor as you gain very little with L19 and 20 DD).

In fact you can have 17 prc levels pre epic if ya do it right.
