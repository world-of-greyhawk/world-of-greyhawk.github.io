<b>Playable from level 1 – 40 …PvM</b><br><br>I made this character because I wanted to make a plain fighter and see what I could do with all the feats.<br><br>It’s almost an iconic fighter build. <br>I allowed myself to take 10 levels of Champion of Torm because it has the same amount of fighter bonus feats up to level 10. I only take feats available to a fighter, so this doesn’t change the main idea of the build. The CoT levels improve the saves of the build by giving better reflex saves and +5 to all saves from sacred defence. The other divine CoT feats are CHA dependant and will not affect this build. CoT has spot as a class skill, and I chose that over concentration. If you want to play an evil character, you will need alignment shifts, and play as neutral part of the time. <br><br>This build is a melee character, Strength based with a one hander and shield.<br>My wish list was:<br>Good AB, damage and reasonable AC, with decent devastating critical DC.<br>Adaptability with different fighter moves (knockdown, disarm, expertise, PA) and different damage types (slashing main weapon and blunt backup weapon).<br>I also wanted to improve the saves the fighter gets. I chose dwarf because of the high Con and the class bonuses to saves.<br><br>As a plain fighter type this character depends on either good items to adventure alone, or a party that can supply him with buffs. I had PvM in mind when I made the build. <br><br>I will thank you for the feedback I got when I made this build, and especially the ideas Mithdradates gave me.<br><br><br><b>Feat Master</b><br><br>Race: Dwarf<br><br>Alignment: Any neutral or good<br><br>Attributes:<br>STR 16 -&gt; 30<br>DEX 10<br>CON 18<br>WIS 10<br>INT 14<br>CHA 6<br><br>Leveling guide:<br>Levels 1-8 Fighter<br>Levels 9-10 Champion of Torm<br>Levels 11-12 Fighter<br>Levels 13-18 Champion of Torm<br>Levels 19-38 Fighter<br>Levels 39-40 Champion of Torm<br><br>Final level distribution:<br>Fighter 30<br>Champion of Torm 10<br><br>Feats:<br>Level 1: Luck of Heroes, Power Attack<br>Level 2: Cleave<br>Level 3: Iron Will<br>Level 4: Weapon Focus (Longsword*)<br>Level 6: Great Fortitude, Weapon Specialization (Longsword*)<br>Level 8: Blind Fight<br>Level 9: Toughness<br>Level 10: Knockdown<br>Level 12: Weapon Focus (Warhammer), Weapon Specialization (Warhammer)<br>Level 14: Improved Knockdown<br>Level 15: Improved Critical (Longsword*)<br>Level 16: Expertise<br>Level 18: Disarm, Improved Disarm<br>Level 20: Great Cleave<br>Level 21: Great Strength I<br>Level 22: Epic Weapon Focus (Longsword*)<br>Level 24: Great Strength II, Overwhelming Critical (Longsword*)<br>Level 26: Epic Weapon Specialization (Longsword*) <br>Level 27: Great Strength III<br>Level 28: Devastating Critical (Longsword*)<br>Level 30: Epic Will, Epic Prowess<br>Level 32: Armor Skin<br>Level 33: Epic Fortitude<br>Level 34: Epic Weapon Focus (Warhammer)<br>Level 36: Epic Reflexes, Epic Weapon Specialization (Warhammer)<br>Level 38: Improved Expertise<br>Level 39: Great Strength IV<br>Level 40: Improved Power Attack<br><br>Hit points:<br>600 (maxed every level)<br><br>Final saves :<br>Fortitude 40 <br>Reflex 30 <br>Will 28 <br>Add +6 to saves against spells (+4 from spellcraft, +2 racial bonus) and +2 to saves against poison (racial bonus)<br><br>AB and damage:<br>Longsword*: 44/39/34/29, 1d8 + 16 (17-20/x2), O.

You can choose Scimitar if you want lower nominal damage, but higher critical threat range.
