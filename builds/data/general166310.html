It might be beneficial to create a post for people looking to duel. As of right now there is noone on the server. Ppl could post what times they would want to duel  and be able to find matches. OR something like that, it's damn early and  Im a tad bit fuz-brained.<br><br>Whatcha think,<br><br>~E~<br>_________________<br>It's not a bad partnership.

I think it's an excellent idea. I have already made a character and would love to duel. Unfortunatly my winter break is starting and I won't be able to play for about a week or two.

I have one or two characters that I would like to test... but I can't until I get back on Sunday this week. Possibly Sunday or Monday, I will be on the server playing and hoping for someone to fight with. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.

My monk/sd/assassin is guaranteed to crash you ona duel. Just ask Anuis.<br><br>Maybe an alternate route is to have a weekly dueling time set up as well as trying to schedule a specific time with a certain person. That way we will have a lot of people on at once.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>
