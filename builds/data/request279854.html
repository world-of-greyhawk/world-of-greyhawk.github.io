Hey all.  <br><br>I am looking for some assistance in tweaking this build to get the most out of it.  I realize strength based rangers are "better" from a power standpoint; but that isn't what this is about <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">    This is about building a classic Ranger type woodland scout.  Equally adept with bow or blade and sneaky enough to scare assassins <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">   <br><br>I am going for a Party based scout/ranger who can deal with traps and locks en route to his target; and deal decent ranged or close in damage as a support archer or fighter.  Still survivable solo is a must as well; hence the stealth focus.  if I don't have a party I can always use traps and summons to distract targets enough to hopefully take them out quick.  The Epic Dodge and HiPS will aid a lot there too.<br><br>Two of my FEs are already picked; because they are the main threat at lower levels and also crit immune; but the rest I would pick as I determine what is needed most...  Oh, and you'll notice Blinding Speed is in there at level 36.  there are no perma anything items on this world; it is very low magic.  that 10 round boost will be huge for this PC <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>Yes, changing race would help and avoid the penalty; but it has to be an Elf.  If you have suggestions on better class spread or mix I am more than happy to consider them (the PW is low XP gain already; I would prefer no penalty if I could help it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    )<br><br>So; please suggest away; hopefully you can come up with a better way to reach my goal <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   <br><br><b>Llewyrr Woodlord (or: Woodland shadow)</b><br>Ranger(26), Shadowdancer(10), Rogue(4)<br><br>Elf; Chaotic Good (any)<br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 18 (30)<br>CON: 8<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 16<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 324<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 20/18/30 (Slippery Mind)<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +2<br>BAB: 28<br>AB: 42 (melee), 42 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/ armor/shield): 28/31<br>Spell Casting: Ranger(4)  (Spells/Day:  4/4/3/3)<br><br>Skillpoints Total: 349<br>Animal Empathy 30(29)<br>Disable Trap 21(26)<br>Discipline 43(43)<br>Hide 43(63)<br>Listen 43(47)<br>Move Silently 43(63)<br>Open Lock 16(26)<br>Search 37(42)<br>Set Trap 33(45)<br>Tumble 40(50)<br><br><b>Level Guide:</b><br>01: Rogue(1): Point Blank shot<br>02: Ranger(1): Favored Enemy: Elementals, {Dual Wield}<br>03: Ranger(2): Weapon Finesse<br>04: Rogue(2): DEX+1, {Evasion}, (DEX=19)<br>05: Ranger(3)<br>06: Ranger(4): Dodge<br>07: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>08: Ranger(5): DEX+1, Favored Enemy: Undeads, (DEX=20)<br>09: Ranger(6): Mobility<br>10: Shadowdancer(1): {Hide in Plain Sight}<br>11: Shadowdancer(2): {Darkvision}<br>12: Shadowdancer(3): DEX+1, Weapon Focus: Longbow, (DEX=21)<br>13: Ranger(7)<br>14: Ranger(8)<br>15: Ranger(9): Rapid Shot, {Improved Two-Weapon Fighting}<br>16: Ranger(10): DEX+1, Favored Enemy I, (DEX=22)<br>17: Ranger(11)<br>18: Ranger(12): Weapon Focus: Shortsword<br>19: Ranger(13)<br>20: Ranger(14): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br>21: Ranger(15): Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow, Epic Weapon Focus: Shortsword<br>22: Ranger(16)<br>23: Ranger(17)<br>24: Ranger(18): DEX+1, Epic Skill Focus: Hide, (DEX=24)<br>25: Ranger(19)<br>26: Ranger(20): Favored Enemy II<br>27: Ranger(21): Bane of Enemies<br>28: Shadowdancer(4): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br>29: Shadowdancer(5): {Defensive Roll}<br>30: Shadowdancer(6): Epic Skill Focus: Move Silently<br>31: Ranger(22)<br>32: Shadowdancer(7): DEX+1, {Slippery Mind}, (DEX=26)<br>33: Shadowdancer(8): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=27)<br>34: Shadowdancer(9)<br>35: Shadowdancer(10): {Improved Evasion}<br>36: Ranger(23): DEX+1, Epic Dodge, Blinding Speed, (DEX=28)<br>37: Rogue(4)<br>38: Ranger(24)<br>39: Ranger(25): Great Dexterity II, Epic Prowess, (DEX=29)<br>40: Ranger(26): DEX+1, Favored Enemy III, (DEX=30)<br><br><br>Thanks for looking!<br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By 4SakN on 07/31/07 15:52</span></i></p>

My main suggestion would be to do either Rogue 13/SD 1 or Rogue 10/SD 5 to get ED instead of Rogue 4/SD 10. Gets you more skillpoints, more sneak damage and more frequent UMD dumps.  I would also lower Dex to 16 so you can put some points into Con - it's awfully low for a melee build. I would drop blinding speed (with UMD, you can use scrolls for haste if there are no perma-haste items) and ESF: MS for 2 more Great Dex feats to keep final dex the same. I would probably drop ESF: hide for Armor Skin (with high AC and ED he won't be hit at all, and his Hide and MS skills are already high thanks to Dex and Ranger spells/bonuses). With more Rogue levels, you might also be able to drop Int to 14 to boost Con or Str as well. You don't really need the points in Discipline since he is likely to have AC higher than 63, making any hit automatically beat his discipline roll.<br><br>TM

Good points again, thanks! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   though I am not sure I understand your last one.  The lower AC he would have would still be considered "good" as a 63 would on a higher magic server; so he will still have about the same chances of getting hit, yes?  <br><br>I would love to see him with AC in the 50s or higher; I just don't think the gear will be available for it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>-4SakN<br><i>"never kiss a girl whose brothers have knife scars." <br>"never gamble without knowing a back way out."</i><br>-Robert Jordan

No, high magic favors defense, low magic favors offense. The reason is that you can add the magic level to your AC 5 times (natural, armor, shield, deflection, dodge), but only once to your AB. <br><br>So if your naked AC is 30, and the magic level is +5, you get say +5 from medium armor, +3 from a tower shield, +4 from perma-haste and 5*5 from magic enhancements = +25, for a total of 67 or so. A fighter's AB may be 43 with a mundane weapon, so if he gets +5 that means his AB is 48, and he needs a 19 or more to hit (I have ignored ability buffs here, but let's assume that you can buff your Dex the same amount as he can buff Str and they wash).<br><br>Now in a +3 world, you lose 5 * 2 and 4 if there's no perma-haste, and your AC drops to 53. The fighter only loses 2, so his AB is 46, and he now only needs a 7 to hit you. <br><br>In a no-magic world, your AC is 30 + 5 + 3 = 38, and the fighter's AB is 43, so he hits you on anything but a 1. In fact, even on his second attack of the round, he still hits you on anything but a 1. <br><br>By the way, this is why mages are so useful to a party in low-magic settings - a mage can guarantee you a +5 weapon with GMW, +1 to 4 armor types with Mage Armor (or +5 to AC from a Cleric with magic Vestment), some more from Shield, natural armor from Shadow Shield, elemental damage from Flame Weapon, elemental resistance, etc. In low magic settings, a fighter who has been thoroughly buffed by a cleric or mage will have a huge advantage over one who hasn't. Once the magic level hits +5 or higher, that advantage is much smaller and the mages just concentrate on offensive spells instead of buffing their fighters.<br><br>TM

Heh, a druid, well those are cool for low magic, buffed shifters have about the same stats no matter the environment so they rock on the low ones.<br><br>About the XP penalty, well, why are you taking Rogue to start with? just 4 levels? Shadowdancer covers Uncanny and Epic Dodge pre-requisites, so you can take Assassin for the little sneak and the skills without XP penalty, it might be less playable early on, but you can take Assassin at level 6, so it's not that bad.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.
