It should be without.  As is apparent, 99.999% of builds posted are without prc.  So far only 2 prc builds have been posted.  If you were to make it prc you could no longer go to that server to test a char.

Especially with new feats, new spells, and new skill(jump skill), and many more. And especially with PrC, you can get much more powerful characters than the standard builds. There are many classes in there that can give you more than what you would get out of the standard builds, such as free feats that you normally would take in order to get another class. Example of this is the Battlerager, it gives you free Great Cleave feat at level 4, almost every barbarian build has Great Cleave in it. It frees up the feat slot and gives you option of getting more feats.<br><br>Sorry about long boring post... lol. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>Anuis

I like PRC because they bring NWN much more in line with pnp rules.A lot of the extra prestige classes also give more life to the game.
