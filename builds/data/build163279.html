It's ofr the extra 10 AC at very little cost offensively.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

-10 AB is very little cost?<br><br>The only time I can see IEx being useful is if you need 20 to hit but can be hit much more easily in return. I can't see this being the case in PvP. In PvM if there's a boss that tough you probably need a group and to stick to spellcasting.<br><br>Back to the build, I'm not sure about 17 in both spellcasting classes. OK you get two different sets of spells, but you can't cast in Dragon form and you miss out on Epic spells. Besides Level 8 &amp; 9 Druid spells ain't so hot and there are a bunch of dupes too.

Offensive epic spells are usuallu useless anyway, and only mages can take defensive epic spells.<br><br>Remember that you don't have to have IE always on - you can turn it off when fighting enemies with high AC. But I created a very similar character some time ago, and his AB was high enough to hit almost everything with every attack - and he had 97 AC without items when fully buffed and with IE.

I'm kind of fond of empower spell <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>also extend spell makes a lot of sense for a cleric dragon, that way the buffs will actually matter!<br><br>IE is for huge bosses and nothing else, it's a tank if I've ever seen one with 80+ AC easily, lots of hps, some dmg res, extraordinary saves, and passable AB even with IE if you're buffed.<br><br>lvl 9 spells in both C and D maybe isn't ultimate but it does give you a casting dragon... and what epic spell could possibly be of any use? epic warding is IMHO the only worthwhile and I can't get that one anyways.

I guess if, on your PW, IE makes the difference between taking huge bosses out and not (must be a very formulaic world) then it's worth taking.<br><br>I understand your point about spells - you get spell flexibility to make up for your loss of level 8 &amp; 9 spells.

it's as easy as this, with IE on it's a huge tank with some dmg ability.<br>with IPA on it's a decent tank with great dmg ability <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

Yeah, but you could replace IE with Improved Crit (Unarmed Strike) which survives into Dragon Shape, and another feat and be even better at damage, unless your world has everyone immune to crits.<br><br>For me the best form of defense is attack, and if they're laying on their butts you ain't got no problems, but that's just the way I am...
