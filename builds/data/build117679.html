I have no idea how you made this character.  I couldn't get it to work at all -- you don't get Improved Evasion where you say, nor Defensive Roll or Epic Dodge, or pretty much any of the epic feats.  Did you actually test this build?

I'll have a quick go of correcting the build. I haven't tested this version either, but it *should* work fine. I've included how many levels in each class the character  should have at each level, to make it easier to follow.

Or take Called Shot instead, and ensure they never get near enough to hit you with anything. It's a minor point though, the build in general is excellent. 9d6 sneak attacks, Self Concealment 5 and Epic Dodge in one nice archer-shaped package? Yes please! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Nice build, just one thought.<br><br>As you could take EWF before SC1 it suggests that you could start with Dex 19 and put 3 points somewhere else. Possibly Str (+ the odd extra point late). Trade 1 AB to get an extra 2 damage with a composite bow.<br><br>I think this could be a good trade because on sneak immune targets the damage output might need a boost.

Again, I haven't built it myself, but here's a quick run-down of how the AB and stuff should pan out. Without magical equipment, obviously.<br>AB<br>26 BAB<br>+12 Dex modifier<br>+11 Enchant Arrow bonus<br>+3 Weapon Focus / Epic Weapon Focus<br>= 52 AB unbuffed. I don't even know what buffs are available for this character, except True Strike. So that's +72 to attack, but for a very short time.<br><br>AC<br>10 base<br>+12 Dex modifier<br>+8 Tumble<br>= 30 AC unbuffed. Don't think there are any buffs available for AC for this character. That AC does seem rather low, though he does have Epic Dodge and SC5 to help it out.<br><br>Damage<br>1d8<br>+11 Enchant Arrow bonus<br>+1 Point Blank Shot<br>+9d6 sneak attack<br>= 28 to 74 damage, if you include the sneak attacks and are within 30 feet (I think) of the enemy. Crits on 19 or 20, with a x3 multiplier.<br><br>HP<br>Rogue levels: (17x6) = 102<br>AA levels: (22x8) = 176<br>Wizard levels: (1x4) = 4 (surprisingly! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">   )<br>Con bonus = 40<br>Toughness = 40<br>= 462 in total. Damn good for an archer, I believe.<br><br>Saves<br>Fortitude 3+6+0 (base) + 10 (epic levels bonus) = 19 (27 vs. spells)<br>Reflex 7+6+0 + 10 = 24 (32)<br>Will 3+2+2 = 17 (25)<br>I guess his saves are quite weak; I may fiddle around with his levelling pre-20 to see what can be done for them.<br><br><br>*EDIT*<br>In fact, if you take the levels as Rogue 9 / Wizard 1 / AA 10 up to level 20, you end up with the following saves:<br>f 3+7+0 = 10<br>r 6+7+0 = 14<br>w 3+3+2 = 8<br>which is +1 to Fortitude and Will. Levelling this way means not taking Improved Evasion til epic levels though, which could play merry hell with the order of epic feats. It's up to you if you want to change it, i mean, it is only +1 to Fortitude and Will, nothing major.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Herbie Shimmer on 11/22/04 21:22</span></i></p>

Thanks guys. I really like this build. Maybe the ab is a bit lacking but the sneaks will make up for it. <br><br>I started making this in the pw I play in and its already doing well. <br><br>Also I hardly played any rogue, but the combat takes a whole different angle when you try to hit monsters in the back for sneaks. Much less boring then sword and shield melee type.

Arcane spellcasters = Bard/Sorceror/Wizard, but here Wizard is by far the best, as apart from removing XP penalties, Int is also useful to the build for skills, while Cha is pretty useless.

And you dont need bard for UMD or tumble, because you are already getting it from the Rogue levels. <br><br>One of the good things of this build is the many skillpoints. Especially for PW's with high dc locks or even the nasty pickpocket skill is very usefull.

Calm down tanassi. As I stated when I reposted the build, it wasn't tested, and yes, sorry, I made a mistake. It was only a conjecture, intended to help people. If you want to follow an untested build of someone else's, that's up to you.<br><br>But once you've calmed down, it should be a bit of a no-brainer to see that you can swap the Great Dex feat taken on level 27 with Epic Dodge. So on level 24, you take Great Dex and Defensive Roll, then on level 27, you take Epic Dodge.<br><br>Hope that works and clears things up for you. Let me know if it doesn't allow you to take Epic Dodge on 27; I think I can re-jig the levelling order again so you don't have to drop it.

Actually, doing what I said above won't work either....you need to take a Rogue level on 27 in order to pump Tumble up to 30 ranks. Here's what you should do from level 24 onwards:<br><br>24: Rogue 13 / AA 10 / Wizard 1 - Dex 27, Defensive Roll*, Great Dex 28<br>25: AA 11 / Rogue 13 / Wizard 1<br>26: AA 12 / Rogue 13 / Wizard 1<br>27: Rogue 14 / AA 12 / Wizard 1 - Epic Dodge<br>28: AA 13 / Rogue 14 / Wizard 1 - Dex 29<br>29: AA 14 / Rogue 14 / Wizard 1 - Great Dex 30**<br>30: Rogue 15 / AA 14 / Wizard 1 - Self Concealment I<br>31: AA 15 / Rogue 15 / Wizard 1<br>32: AA 16 / Rogue 15 / Wizard 1 - Dex 31<br>33: AA 17 / Rogue 15 / Wizard 1 - Self Concealment II<br>34: AA 18 / Rogue 15 / Wizard 1 - Epic Weapon Focus Longbow**<br>35: Rogue 16 / AA 18 / Wizard 1 - Self Concealment III*<br>36: AA 19 / Rogue 16 / Wizard 1 - Dex 32, Self Concealment IV<br>37: AA 20 / Rogue 16 / Wizard 1<br>38: AA 21 / Rogue 16 / Wizard 1<br>39: AA 22 / Rogue 16 / Wizard 1 - Self Concealment V, Great Dex 33**<br>40: Rogue - Dex 34<br><br>Now I *really* can't see any reason why that wouldn't work. But again, it's not tested, since I don't have NWN installed at the moment. Let us know if this version doesn't work either.

Tanassi,<br><br>What you can do with your online character is Export him (save him) to your local NWN directory. Then launch your favorite trainer mod (eg. the Novice to Epic mod in my signature). You will be able to select the local copy of your PW character as a premade character. Now you can level him/her up and test different paths to level 40 to see what you like. Take notes (I use a standard Excel blank character sheet I made) then save those notes and use them to guide you as your online character levels up.<br><br>Good luck.<br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br>Check out the Epic Character Builders Guild<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Test your new builds in this mod:<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/modules/data/1073117317280.shtml" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

Just a note here on this build.<br><br>I built this on my persistant world and found it highly effective indeed. My only complaint is the need to get sneak attack damage into the equation in order to do lots of damage. I did change mobility out for weapon finesse, as I find myself running around with a shield and rapier alot against mobs. That said, I was in a party last night that ran into a group of minions and out of 5 guys that went in, I only died after I mistakenly took off a piece of gear that made me immune to fear. Everyone else died 5 or 6 times or more. The key here was that devastating crit from the minions just never went off on my character. Everyone else was falling over quite a bit from just that one feat. After correcting my problem I was able to go back in and get everyone else.<br><br>A shout out to the original author and the fellows that came thru and corrected what few mistakes he had in the original posting. I like the versatility of the build lots of skill points, high ab, and high ac. With the rapier I am sporting I have a 56 ab with this build and can bump it to 76 with true strike. Not to shabby for an archer.<br><br>-Pendragon

I'd take Iron Will or Great Fortitude (or maybe Luck of Heroes) over Toughness.  With the concealment and Epic Dodge, an extra 20 hit points aren't going to be that helpful in the face of someone who can actually get to you and HIT you!  This build has low hit dice and only 12 CON, so better to add to your weak saves than HP... at least by my reckoning.
