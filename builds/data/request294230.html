I am looking for a shifter build to emulate a man possessed by demons (or abyssals) who command his forms.  A sort of force of anti-nature.  I think the RP aspects of the "General" idea are astounding <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>A Druidic caster; capable of calling forth the pestilence of the world; raining down the judgement of nature, and attack or taunt in any of hundreds of different forms. mmm   such low magic world RP goodness.<br><br>Any ideas on how to make him exactly?  I know monk would be a beautiful addition to this build for the power; but I am not so sure that the discipline of a monk really fits the idea of a body host to hundreds of souls.  Blackguard seemed to fit well; but what mix?  what format to best make use of the different abilities?<br><br>My thoughts lead me to believe the best path would be a fully casting Druid; with shifter enough to provide all the forms in reasonable power; and class 3 to add to the strengths; or fill weaknesses... but I am still open to ideas.<br><br>So anyone with some ideas on how to proceed please give them to me; maybe we can create a wild new idea here <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world

Druid 25/Shifter 13/something 2 gives you 2 bonus epic feats and a decent caster lvl (plus undispellable buffs) but you give up on wildshape III and humanoid improved forms (and on infinite wildshape iv). For th esomething part: if not monk, then rogue.<br><br>Druid 21-22/Shifter 17/something 1-2 for epic shapes, 2 epic bonus feats (as above) at the cost of caster lvl and undispellability. Same something as above.<br><br>In both builds you can get at least 1 epic spell: Hellball fits the character concept, but it's otherwise no big deal unless beefed up. <br><br>I'd go for the second build if you want both some caster power and all shapes. I'd also go with Monk, cause a +10 to AC plus tumble ranks is difficult to pass, if not just impossible.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

The most important thing is to choose what kind of shapes you want, Druid shapes are no good for an "anti-nature" force <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   Construct Shapes don't sound like it either, and Humanoid just don't really make the cut, I'd think on Outsider or Undead, but it's your choice, they only need Epic Shifter so I wouldn't take too many Shifter levels, just enough to get the shape feats.<br><br>About the third class... You can take Rogue for Uncanny Dodge and skills, it should work pretty good. Taking Blackguard is not really bad, if you play full shifter style then you can lower all your initial stats and start with a decent CHA to get some saves, that and Bull's Strength, because I recommend not taking too many levels on it. I could RP a Cleric with that description, since Clerics have a deeper connection with higher powers, a evil Cleric can make the role of a man possessed by evil powers from beyond, though power-wise I'd lower a lot of Druid levels for Cleric on such a build (pus, you said low magic, that always means Cleric works).<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/25/08 03:57</span></i></p>

Hmmm, both great ideas there; thanks guys.  I think I['ll play around with both a X cleric/5 Druid/X shifter and a 17-20 Druid/17 Shifter/X rogue or BG and see what works.  I'll post them up here for review and ideas once they are done.<br><br>And Thax; I agree that some of those forms don't "really" fit the idea of the build; but at the same time Shifter doesn't get any demonic forms either.  I think in the long run it may be best to get the forms and RP the evilness overall; but lets see what I can do <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Thanks!<br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world

RP builds can always be sorted out, like "I say dragons are demonic" so I take dragon shape <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    when I'm roleplaying my build I care not about what other think about me, I only need to satisfy myself, that's why I don't play in RP servers, everybody says cheesy Cleric/Monk or Druid/Monk is "powerbuild" and not an understandable role, they just don't notice that's the role I like to play.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/25/08 23:07</span></i></p>

True on all counts.  Demon dragons; undead and especially Death Slaad <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>That was what I meant by "rp it".  Now if evil shifters were to gain an option for "Balor Shape" or something; that would really make it work <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"><br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world

A druid shifter blackguard would have demonic and undead servitors in addition to the odd shapes he takes, and if built right would have taunt, high wisdom and another mental stat that would increase damage and ab in any form. Also, from an rp perspective you dont want to forget the rabbi who built the first golem. The history of the golem worldwide is one of inanimate objects moved by unclean spirits.

You might also think about Druid Monk Assassin and use the Elder Earth elemental shape.<br><br>Your build would have base 34 Str and 22 Con when shifted.  Your theme could be "Demonic Elemental Lord."  Dumping all of your level up stat points into Wisdom would net you more monk ac.<br><br>26/2/12 for unlimited Elemental shape.<br>20/2/18 for 3 shapes but much more Death Attack damage.<br><br>I have played that build on BoW and like it alot.<br><br>You also have the option of using Air Elemental shape for 34 Dex instead.  That would increase your AC and sneak ability.  Weapon Finness yourself for some nice AB too.<br><br>I suggest taking 2 monk levels for the Deflect Arrow freebee.  It's worth it's weight in gold if you ask me.<br><br>I also suggest more assassin levels since your death attack DC will be higher.
