30th level "Epic" characters? <br>Author<br>Martin Schou <br><br><br>I play on a server limited to 30th level characters. This poses some interesting challenges to your builds, because the fun combinations get out of reach. As an added bonus to the trickyness, the server also removes all Immunity properties from items (not creature effects, so creatures, classes, races and shifters with immunities keep them). In addition True Seeing has been scaled down, so sneaks are much harder to find that on most other servers I've tried.<br><br>As an example of the challenge in making interesting builds, it's not difficult to make a Mage build with Auto Quicken Spell III and Epic Dodge for instance when you have 40 levels to do it, but in 30 levels, it's impossible - you simply don't have the number of feats or flexibility for it. Best as I can figure any way. If you can figure out how, please let me know *grins*<br><br>I thought you might find this to be an interesting challenge, that vary from the norm. As an example of wacky builds I've played around with on the 30th level restriction would be:<br><br>Bard/RDD/Rogue that has Devastating Critical and Epic Dodge in the same package. You could substitute the 13 Rogue levels for 10 SD levels and get HiPS as well.<br><br>Bard/RDD/PM - Devastating Critical but immune to Criticals.<br><br>Bard/AA/SD - Wisdom-based Shadowdancing Archer made to find and exterminate the annoying sneaks, while being hidden.<br><br>Bard/AA/RDD - Wisdom/Strength based Archer with Devestating Critical. Not as good at hiding as the SD one, but can take out most sneaks in a few critical hits, as they tend to have horrible saves.<br><br>I'll postpone posting full build descriptions here until I know if this has an interest to anyone.<br><br><br>@@  @@  @@  @@  @@  @@  @@  @@  @@  @@  @@  @@  @@  @@  @@ <br>             <br>Celestial Defender <br><br>What server?

I am merely curious what you people could come up with, when restricted to level 30 instead of 40. Not everybody play on 40th level servers. Hell, there are still 20th level servers around. It makes things challanging when you can't just go to this site and find a build to go for.<br><br>The difficult thing in building is that it is a high-magic world, plenty of +10 items to go around, with the exception of weapons. And it has both PvM and PvP a plenty.<br><br>Most melee characters are something like Fighter10/WM19/Rogue1, so they can get UMD and almost max AB. This gives them an AC of 73 and an AB in the high 50's, so pretty much every hit will be critical. It's also a fight to get your AB as high as possible, so you can get more than just 20 natural hits in a fight.<br><br>And since all the high-end armor has 20/- damage reduction to physical damage, you're looking at some very annoying fights.<br><br>Personally I build strange and weird builds, rather than the conventional. Like a Bard/Red Dragon Disciple/Pale Master with Devastating Critical and Immunity to Critical Hits. At level 30 it can go toe to toe with a Prismatic Dragon and win, though most of the reason for this is an AC of 88. Tried it four times, died once due to a failed will save against its Prismatic Spray. Maybe I should see what he can do at level 40 ... heh
