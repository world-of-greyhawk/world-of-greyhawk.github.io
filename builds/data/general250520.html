Hello, I was trying to make a PvP Fighter, Weapons Master and maybe one more Class. I was thinking of the starting feats to be Blooded and Thug to add to the initative bonuses(Eventually getting imp Intiative and Supioior). Also I was thinking of makeing him real high in Taunt Skill and getting Skill focus and epic skill focus in it. My choice of Weapon would a Greatsword. I was also thinking of taking Monk lvls so He could wear cloth armor, gain Tumble the Monk speed and get to lvl 6 for Imp KD. Now would going three more Monk lvls to Nine be worth it, to get improved evasion? I also wanted him to have a high Attack Bonus and good AC I know that will be hard with what I'm looking for. So if anyone has Idea's, improvement's and suggestion's I would greatly appriciate it. Thank you.

hm..well as far as 6 monk for IKD, and clothes goes; id rather take more ftr levels, since for weapon master you need 13 int, you can pick up a few feats as well as IKD. For imp evasion, id go 10 rogue over 9 monk, sinceyou get sneaks, imp evasion, as well as UMD with tumble.

The background story for the char that I had in mind wouldn't be a rouge, and on the sever I play UMD dosent fit the world, i could get UMD but wouldn't be right. Thanks for your imput though, good looking out.
