Anyone know a kick butt Bard build that doesn't use RDD or PM? A good one for PvP <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Don't care if it's melee or AA! I'd like it to have max perform also <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Heh heh, sometimes that happens, anyway, you ain't saying a thing in there, just Bard and <b>anything</b> else except RDD and PM leaves so much possibilities I can't pick one.<br><br>I'm not a heavy Bard builder, I've never maxed Perform on any of my builds but I've read you need a ridiculous CHA to achieve it, and I think it was 30 Bard for the full song (only reason to max Perform), however I'd take a Cleric 20 / Fighter 4 / Bard 16 for a general low environment PvP, but that's not even near maxing Perform, just a good amount of Bard to use its skills, spells and a decent song. Give more information about your PW/server and I might be able to make a full build accordingly. <br><br>Hmmm, I know Grizzled_dwarflord and Cinnabar Din have a nice variety of strong Bard builds, you could check them out, or just make a search for Bard and any other class <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   .<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 01/07/07 02:36</span></i></p>

Well...Mostly +5 items, faction gear can get higher. Lots of Dev critters of the 12/25/3 type, I'd like a bard that is preferabley a dexer with high AC, high AC to me is over 60. Umm good fort save to defend against dev should I get hit...Maybe I should just use that Slashing Singer bard wm build mantis13 built? I just don't like the damage output

What's a 12/25/3 type?<br><br>Oh btw, why is it you don't want RDD or PM, server restriction?<br><br>If you want damage output you'll need some STR or sneak attack, you just can't pretend a dexer to make damage out of nowhere. Well, if you want a Dexer, you might want to take 10 SD or 13 Rogue levels as pre-reqs for Epic Dodge, Rogue would give the needed sneak attack, Cleric or Wizard could give a good damage enhance with Darkfire / Flame Weapon, or even Druid for a dragon, which would give you a high AC for PvP, but I'm going too far from a Heavy Bard build... seriously how much Bard would be a minimum here?

Weird, if they all have dev crit, why don't you want PM? a Cleric 20 / Bard 10 / Pale Master 10 should work cool and you're immune to dev crit.<br><br>All right, no PM, you could try a dragon, your Fortitude will be quite high. Or else crazy stuff Paladin/Blackguard/CoT really makes you immune to all saves-related stuff, something like a Paladin 12 / Blackguard 2 / Bard 26 or a variant could be good, your saves will be well enough if you take a decent amount of CHA, might use Divine Might and Divine Shield and a Smite for both good and evil, with a strong song and Lasting Inspiration, etc. AB might not be too bad...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 01/08/07 00:04</span></i></p>

Thax, I was saying that after a Curse song, the ennemy will have a lower save (not by much, but it is lower), which helps with the Gaze attack from the Vampire form.<br><br>A 25th level Bard curse will also put a nice dent into an ennemy's skills.  Again that will help the Vampire land a hit for his level drain bite.  Once level drained, his saves lower a bit too... making the gaze a bit better... (hopefully).<br><br>With no RDD* and no PM, a Crit immune build leaves only a few options.  Druid in Elemental form, a shifter in Undead/Construct form, a mage in Polymorph (zombie) form... *scratches head*... <br><br>*note:  I'm not implying that RDD get's immunity to crit.<br><br>Bard and Shifter forms go quite well together.  You can sing and curse while shifted.  The Vampire also has some nice aspects to it that make it unique (Unlike the Risen Lord singer that most people would go for).<br><br>*shrug*<br><br>Hug a shifter, that's all I'm asking.  haha
