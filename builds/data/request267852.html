I play on a server which allows you to reach lvl 60.<br>dev crit and epic dodge is not allowed and magic items are rare, but some nearly as powerful the less good items on BoW. class restrictions are not big, but you are only allowed to take 1 PrC. Sorc/paly is not allowed. Rdd requires chaotic alignement.<br><br>So I'm looking for ideas. There are so many options open. Think big dmg and/or AC<br>_________________<br>Valkos clueless

Level 60 with a low magic world...<br><br>I'd try to take a build that would take advantage of those extra levels in some way.  Extra Sneak attack is nice, but I have something different in mind...<br><br>how about... oh ... say .... &lt;you know it's coming&gt;.... a SHIFTER!<br><br><br>Find a form that increases it's damage output with extra levels.  That would not have a cap on it.  I kinda like my Spitball build for that purpose.  The Death Sladd Lord spits "Magical" damage which has no natural defense against it.  It does not rely on AB and does not care about SR.<br><br>Spitball:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "261829", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>between 40 - 60, take a Druid level in order to get stoneskin and freedom of movement.  Pepper here and there with SD to boost your sneakyness (13 SD levels gets you an Epic feat).  The rest gets dumpped into Shifter level in order to boost the Spit Damage.<br><br>It's a Range Touch Attack so Sneak an Epic Prowess in there and pump up your Wisdom.<br><br>No Zen Archery, str/dex/con get overwritten so don't pump those.  Go EDR, or feats that pump your saves.<br><br><br>===<br><br>Option #2.<br><br>Take a look at my Holy Icicles build:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "265109", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>A Cleric Based Rak Ice Storm spammer.<br>Dr 5/Cl 25/Sh 10<br><br>It would really benefit from 15 more cleric levels and 5 druid levels.<br><br>It would then have the best Icicles around.  18 Blunt + 90 Cold.  allll daaayyy lllooonnnggg<br><br>=====<br><br>Option #3:<br><br>How about a Gargoyle/Undead Tank?<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "265001", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>This build relies upon Mestile Acid Sheath or Elemental Shield to do your damage for you.<br><br>It's a Dr/Wiz/Sh 7/22/11 split.

Take Disarm and cause some AoO for those who are unwilling to touch you.  You want to keep you AC low for this build, you don't care about AB either.  So pump up your EDR and saving throws.

That sounds awesome man, but I don't know at which extent that will work...<br><br>Anyway, you can make something like a Cleric 20 / Ranger 21 / Weapon Master 19 with Bane of Enemies, a lot of buffs and critical power.<br><br>But, how's the magical environment? that's a critical issue.<br><br>I'd probably use an extended version of my Dwarven Abomination or my Magic Master, which lack levels in a 40 environment for something like a Cleric 26 / Fighter 4 / Dwarven Defender 30 or Cleric 24 / Wizard 30 / Monk 6...

Bromium, give it up, he doesn't wants shifters... and you know the dragon shape gets better stats anyway.<br><br>Wow, you can actually take Ranger 56 with all Favored Enemies!? the perfect Bane of Enemies, that's so awesome, so you can take regular classes above level 40, I suspected you'd need to multiclass from level 41 and on, what about prestige classes, they still end up at 30?<br><br>Well, RDD gives a lot of STR boost, which is proportionally big, but the higher your possible STR score is the lower the proportion of the boost, even though RDD is great, it might not be much of a boost after all. As for RDD I'd go Cleric 20 / Sorcerer 29 / RDD 10, use divine power exploit, you get Epic Warding, all the cool spells and tons of buffs (I just remembered I still have to test if Darkfire stacks with Flame Weapon, I'll get to you later on that) but since it's a caster type your STR will be regular, RDD will make up for the CHA and WIS investment, but your STR will be just a bit lower than a regular fighter type. To get superb STR score, you'll probably go Barbarian / Bard / RDD, Barbarian with Mighty Rage will let you buff STR real high, with Bard song and buffs your AB will also be very high.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/08/07 16:53</span></i></p>

That server is just crazy, seems nice. So... any class improvement keeps growing right? so I could get a DR of 45/- with a Dwarven Defender 50, Enchant Arrow XXV with an Arcane Archer 49, 25d6 Death Attack with Assassin 50 and a base DC of 60 +INT modifier, hard to settle on a single build with 60 levels.<br><br>The simple Fighter 11 / Wizard 1 / Arcane Archer 49 will be easy to play and rather strong, for the DR lovers such as me you can extend <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "248564", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>my build</a> as I said previously, but knowing prestige classes go over 30 maybe it's better to go Cleric 20 / Fighter 2 / Dwarven Defender 38, that will give a lot of buffing power and a great DR of 36/-, some rearrangements are needed, as will be for any level 40 build you try to adapt, to manage bonus feats correctly and take more Great STR.<br><br>I'm unsure how much you can manage a pure caster, since you state you can't take Sorcerer/Paladin, perhaps you can improve <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "261644", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>this</a> build, more levels will help to attain epic spells and higher spell penetration.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/08/07 23:26</span></i></p>

Heavy Monk? I fail to see how that will be powerful though... Stunning Fist and Quivering Palm DC's are not dependant on your class level, but your whole level, about 10 stunning fists are normally enough, and unless your fists become stronger after class level 40, going too heavy on Monk will end somewhat weak. But I've given my suggestions already, do as you please, good luck.

That sure is annoying, but it should be sorted out quite easily, 5 levels pre-epic of each will only be a bit of a bugger for BAB in most cases, but that's about it, quite easy to actually just take it.

its "Higher Ground".  Look up there epic leveling system.  <br><br>For your level 60 character i suggest you go to the Higher Ground message board and look at their builds.  Their builds are meant to go all the way to 60 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">

I think a wizard assassin might due the trick. Thax, are you sure Enchant Arrow XXV is available as the max DR is +20?  If it is it would be cool as the extra AB and damage do not apply to the cap.
