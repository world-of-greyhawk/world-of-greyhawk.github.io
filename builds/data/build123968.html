This idea came right after Enter the Jade Empire who had the highest possible DC for stunning attack. So I present you with the Highest possible DC for Death attack. A True Assassin, solo you are a devastating killer. You appear out of no where to slay the mightiest foe.

I have a revised version of Snake Eyes, the previous one was geared for the highest DC for a Death attack, but lacked in other areas.
