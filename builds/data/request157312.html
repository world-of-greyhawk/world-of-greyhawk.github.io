Hmm...your post is a bit chaotic, but your intension is good <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>I'll try and give some additional info <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br><b>Character Creation:</b><br><br>As a human you can get a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 18 on your stats. Other races have modifiers for 2 or more stats, usually one +2 and then one or two other stats get -2. (e.g. Half Orc gets +2 strength, but a -2 intelligence and charisma). This means the +2 stat can now reach a max 20, min 10 and the -2 stat a max 16 and min 6 at character creation.<br><br>Normally it takes the following amount to raise a stat:<br>8-14 =&gt; 1 point<br>15-16 =&gt; 2 points<br>17-18 =&gt; 3 points<br><br>With -2 to a stat:<br>6-12 =&gt; 1 point<br>13-14 =&gt; 2 points<br>15-16 =&gt; 3 points<br><br>With +2 to a stat:<br>10-16 =&gt; 1 point<br>16-18 =&gt; 2 points<br>19-20 =&gt; 3 points<br><br>So if possible pick a race which boosts a stat you need and doesn't limit another stat you'll also need. If you find yourself taking only 14 in a +2 stat, you may have picked the wrong race. Ofcourse there's also race abilities and the race's class preference that count, but I recommend making use of the +2 stat if possible. On the other hand you could consider taking a race because of a -2 stat, so you can lower it to 6 instead of just 8, which gives you 2 extra points to use elsewhere.<br><br>Avoid spending 3 points for increasing a stat unless you really need to (e.g. for getting the maximum at that stat). You can raise more stats if you don't spend 3 points to raise a stat, if necesary you can raise the skill while playing a bit more, then it will only take one point.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Dimundome on 10/12/04 12:58</span></i></p>

<b>Leveling up</b><br><br>Every four levels you can raise one of your stats one point. This means over 40 levels you'll have 10 additional stat points to distribute.<br><br>At Epic levels you'll also have Great &lt;stat name here&gt; feats (e.g. Great Strength), normally you can take a maximum of 7 of these feats, because that's how many regular feats a class will still be getting after becoming epic (level 21). There are however classes which have one (maybe two?) of those feats as a epic bonus feat, which means they can get the maximum of 10 Great &lt;stat name here&gt; feats, enabling you to raise one stat by another 10 points max (and ofcourse some other stats if you have the feats left for it).<br><br>All together this makes it possible to get a stat to 40, provided you start at 20 and take all 10 normal stat increases and all 10 Great &lt;stat name here&gt; feats (7 if your class doesn't have the feat as an epic bonus feat).<br><br><br><b>Red Dragon Disciple</b><br><br>This class is able to boost several stats a little more, with strength being the largest boost (+8). But with Great Strength not being available to any class as an epic bonus feat, you'll only get 7 from that feat max. In case of an Half Orc Red Dragon Disciple this still will get you 20 + 10 + 7 + 8 = 45 max, which is IIRC the highest possible for a stat in the game (non-enhanced). <br><br><br><b>Items, magic, etc</b><br><br>Then there is the last way to raise your stats and that is by items, spells or certain skills (e.g. barbarian rage), these combined can reach a maximum of 12 additional points. E.g. if a belt give you 8 strength and you have Mighty Rage (+8 strength), your bonus will be capped to 12 (rage only adds 4 when activating it in that case).<br><br><br>Well that's about it I think, please correct me if I'm wrong (I could have misunderstood some stuff) or add missing info if I forgot something <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Feats requirements :<br><br>Some feats (Power Attack for example) require you to have an ability minimum (13+ strengh for Power Attack, in our example). This requirement is based on the BASE stat, without any kind of magical increase. A 10 strengh gnome with a belt of strengh +5 is not qualified to take Power Attack, and even if he is a barbarian and uses his rage (+4 strengh), he is still not qualified.<br>To know your base stat, unequip every piece of equipmeent you have, and rest. If your stat is written in white (as opposed to green for a magical increase and red for a magical decrease), it means it is your base stat. In some rare situations (curses, for example), you might still see it in red ; in that case, cure the condition to see your base stat.<br>Only exception, a druid or a shifter in a non-true shape has temporary modifications to his base stats, but these do not work for knowing the requirements for a feat. Our 10 strengh gnome in dragon shape (48 strengh) is still not qualified for Power Attack. You have to unshift to know your base stats.<br>_________________<br>If you call IGMS, Harm, Mestil's acid shield, the Bigby hands or Devastating Critical balanced in your post, don't expect me to like you.<br><br>I'm sorry about my bad english, I'm french.<br>In every lie lies a part of truth.

part 3: effect of dex<br><br>sex effects the following:<br><br>AC: dex gives you a ac modify equal to your dex bonus.

If your dex is low but your wis is high you can zen archery instead.<br><br>you can round a weak long rage accuracy problem by using attacking spells or just engaging in hand to hand.<br><br>reflex saves: effect how easily you can dodge things like fireballs and drangons breath.<br><br>you can get round low reflex by:<br><br>having a class with strong reflexes<br>Using magic that increase your dex or saving throws<br>COT get a saving throw bonus<br>Paladin and blackguard add the cha modify to your saving throws<br>a couple of feats add a bonus to your reflex saving throws.<br><br>Initiative which effects who gets the first attack is also effected by your dex and can improved by a few feats, however initiative is only really important to mages who are fighting each other, since NWN is not turned based.

Seriously though:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Using a combo is proberly you’re best bet.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>The best kind of AC is actually either DEX with Uncanny Dodge, or monk WIS bonus.

It's also vital to the PRC Iajutsu Master.

(I think I put feat and skill relation to stats at end along with a magic bit)<br><br>Part 4: efects of con<br><br>con effect health and therefore the amount of damage you can take. this mean low con characters die easly. you can compasaite for this in a couple ways:<br>high hp classes (throught most high hp character are front line types)<br>high ac (the rogue type option)<br>not being there via stealth, speed or other characters being in the wat.<br>damage reduction<br>magic<br>evaison helps you evade alot of direct damage spells.<br>damage type immunties. (like Palemasters immunity to criticals)<br><br>con also effects fortude and therefore the ablity to resist death effects (rare but nasty) disease and poisen (really a serous problem but can be nasty if your fortude really low) and some spells. Most of these can be counted with a good magic defence, but there are exception (dev critcal for one). heal can deal with diease and poison.<br><br>of course anything that improve your fortude saving throw is going to help (class best save, feats, COT, pal and blackguard)<br><br>On slightly funny note. con also effect your drinking ablity!!

Regarding the CON...<br><br>The best classes that you can use for HP, which are the following... Barbarian and Dwarven Defender.<br><br>They are best when combined, especially when you are in rage. The stats, including the CON increases.<br><br>Basically, what you are looking at is that you can get about 900+ HP from the combination of those two. But you should be able to get 1000+ if you plan the build right, and have the CON at certain amount at the start of the level and taking Toughness feat, Epic Toughness feat can help as well, but not necessary if you plan it well.<br><br>Plus, doing the build above, you get Barbarian's damage reduction. Just the same if you took more than 20 levels of barbarian, you will be able to get Epic Barbarian's damage reduction along with the Dwarven Defender's damage reduction. I believe the highest damage reduction will be used, which would be barbarian, their damage reduction increases every three levels, I think, past 23rd level.<br><br>As for high AC, Palemaster, Rogue(rogue related classes as well) and Monk(Wisdom based).<br><br>If you do the AC route, for Rogue and Palemaster, DEX would be the best to use. As for monk, pump many WIS as you can, and especially can be useful when you are doing Dragon build. Pure monk would be very powerful against wizards since they have high spell resistance, but useless against pure melee based classes.<br><br>As for palemaster, magic is great to use, but they don't last long. Regardless of that, you should get Epic Warding and Epic Mage Armor. If you want true immunity to criticals, Palemaster is the way to go. This is the only class that is immune to the criticals.<br><br>By having balance between all stats, such as DEX, CON, etc... you would be able to get decent saves against most of the effects in the game. But you should take advantages of the race bonuses as well.<br><br>* + means more than this number.<br><br>Hope this was useful to everyone.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.
