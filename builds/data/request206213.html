If anyone has a link to a good one, or just some great tips about feats and skills to take for a pure 40 level Bard, that'd be great, just great.<br>_________________<br>"I have need of you.

Bards are so diverse that it would be helpful if you provide a little more on what kind of bard you're looking for.<br><br>Swashbuckler? (i.e. someone who can hold their own in a fight)<br>Classic? (to me, though this is open to interpretation, this would be a great party buffer, but not as successful on his/her own)<br>Jack of all Trades?<br><br>I (and many others) enjoy building Bards, and a 40th level Bard could be interesting.  But without more details, not sure we will actually be helping you much.<br><br>Also, does it have to be 40 lvls of Bard?  Would a 38/1/1 type build be alright?

It will be a Bard that is exclusive to a party, for buffing only, very little fighting.<br><br>38/1/1 might not be out of the question if it were to help him stay alive and help with the buffs.

I love Bards, especially in a party setting. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By jjellison on 08/02/05 00:38</span></i></p>

Oh, another question.<br><br>Does Charisma bonus affect the Curse and Bard song at all?  Like duration, power, etc?

I guess it affects it the same as it affects the bardsong. Cha modifier gets added to your perform skill so... Your curse song uses to be the same as your bardsong, (Unless you dont have enough perform for the bardsong for your level, by playing it you will raise your skills, and sometimes be able to have a more potent curse song than bardsong because that skill boost makes you reach the needed perform skill for a higher song.<br>_________________<br>HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh.
