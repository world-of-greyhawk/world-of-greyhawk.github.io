I remember once upon a time I came across a dwarven crossbow user...  I believe it was a Fighter/Rogue of some sort.  Too bad I had to reformat and lost all my bookmarks, not to mention the searche engine never helps as much as you would think it would.<br><br>So, anyone either want to link me or suggest a new build?  I'm pretty much open besides the requirement it be a dwarf or gnome and use a crossbow.

Crossbow is not the best of weapons per se. You get just 1 apr no matter your BAB. Rapid reload grants you one more apr (not the same as with a bow as stated). Haste and DP are the only other ways to get additional attacks. Therefore, you should be exploting DP and have access to Haste (Travel domain) or permahaste items. <br><br>I'll give it a tought, FTR/Cleric/something (Rogue?) sounds good.<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 01/03/07 21:36</span></i></p>

Hm...  So the best you could do is +1 rapid reload, +1 divine power, +1 haste, +1 rapid shot?  Crap, do I have to have a +15 BAB to get the +1 from Divine Power?<br><br>Are they all at full BAB, then?

Yep, that's the only plus. Out of those 4 listed attacks, at least 3 are at full AB. All except the Rapid Reload one.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again
