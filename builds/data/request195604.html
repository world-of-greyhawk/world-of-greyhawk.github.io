But with a fair degree of melee involved.<br><br>I'd like something with 26 levels of Sorc and combined with Epic Spell Penetration feat(s), I think I can deal with most critters in my PW.<br><br>I thought of something like Pally 4/Fighter 10/Sorc 26.  The Paladin for the saves and the immunity from fear.  The Fighter for the feats and Epic Weapon Specialization and of course, the Sorc class.<br><br>I was just wondering if it was better to take more Pally levels or more Fighter ones in a build such as this?  Have been toying with the idea of taking more Paladin levels to have more buffing-type spells and some more Pally-type abilities.  <br><br>Even thought of doing like a Pally 15/Sorc 25 build so I can have Holy Sword.<br><br>Any thoughts/suggestions?  Thank ye in advance..<br><br>Joe

Have you thought maybe of sorc26/pally4/rdd10?<br>RDD +8 str helps a lot and lets you focus a bit more on cha; 4 lvls pally should let you get divine shield/might.  Sorc26 with epic spell penetration is about right.. max toolset sr is 32 iirc; and if its pvp you have mords to help a bit.  You can also cast holy sword from a scroll if you can get those.

Thanks for the quick reply!<br><br>Yes, I thought of RDD.  Did it with my Bard (and most likely will do it again with another Bard build of mine).<br><br>I thought while it would be nice to have the added STR of the RDD (and the added CHA as well), Fighter would grant me better AB/the Epic Weapon Specialization (which is almost like adding 12 STR)/and added feats.<br><br>Just something I was kicking around and wondered what you all thought about it.  Definitely will take some Pally levels for Divine Might/Shield though...seems like good feats to take on me PW.<br><br>Joe
