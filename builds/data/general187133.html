I've seen quite a few members mention that they test their builds regularly against Prismatic Dragons.  Using the Novice to Epic Character builder today, I attempted to do this.  I built up a 16 bard/10 rdd/14 PM build and equipped it with +5 gear all around (the mod I play on caps the magic items at +5).  Using all my buffs and a few cleric scrolls, I was able to boost my AB to +62 for the character's initial strike. At +62, however, I wasn't able to even scratch the prismatic dragon.  Does the prismatic have an incredibly high AC?  I was just wondering what the stats are.  In addition, I was also wondering on a PW with the items capped at +5 if +62 AB is going to be enough at level 40?  Appreciate your input - thanks...

I think that those dragons can only be hit by weapons of a certain minimum power (+7 maybe) but I'm not sure.<br><br>I always get the "weapon ineffective" message when fighting them.

The Prismatic Dragon has a DR of 30/? <br><br>You pretty much need a magical weapon to do melee damage to it. Note it's immune to sneak attacks but NOT to critical hits.

Yep; you'd need some pretty heavy artiliary to hit it.  Let alone survive it.  Some PW's/modules reduce them a bit to make them challenging but doable.

I was using a +5 battleaxe.  Are you telling me you need greater than a +5 weapon to hit a prismatic dragon? I wasnt getting the weapon ineffective message, I was merely missing with my swings every time.  How high of an AB do you need to hit that thing?

from another post:<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Personally I am a bit disappointed that these beasts never made an appearence in OC, even though they have been added in toolset.

Perhaps the Prismatic Dragon has the "deathless Mastery" feat (ala PM) which makes it sneak and crit immune in 1.66...

no - as it is right now it immune to sneaks not crits that's the opposite of what the PM has now.<br><br>And I don't see why the prismatic dragon would have "deathless mastery".
