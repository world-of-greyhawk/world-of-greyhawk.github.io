You only need 15 barbarian levels to get terrifying rage... so you can go 16 barb/20 SD/4 fighter, possibly at the cost of a point of AB, by going 15 barb/4sd/1 fighter pre-20, then taking your 16th barb level at 39 for terrifying rage and maxed out intimidate.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

I wasn't sure about short swords myself, but if they are indeed considered medium weapons for halflings then they should be switched to daggers (and the same goes for WF,EWF,WS,EWS of course).<br>If building an elf you can keep the short swords instead.<br>Thank you for pointing it out <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

As a meat shield the level 10 Shadow summon is defensively as effective or more effective than the Epic Shadowlord level 19 summon, which lacks concealment. Other than that the defenses are identical. Only the hit points are increased (balanced by the concealment it evens out, and the AB and dmg is increased by the epic shadowlord.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

Heh, I've built a few of these feral-eyed freaks.  You did a fairly decent job at putting this guy together, good job.  I have only one suggestion, and you can take it with a grain of salt.<br><br>Rogue over Shadowdancer.  Perhaps the build's biggest drawback is damage output and lack of UMD.  While you're tough defensively, you lack any real offensive threat.  <br><br>You could go Barbarian16/Rogue24 (Barb15/Rogue25), still get enough bonus feats to get Epic Dodge and SC V, obtain more skill points, grab Terrifying Rage at Lvl24, still be able to top out Intimidate at the end via Rogue class skill, get 13d6 sneak attack (91d6 per round hasted) and avoid an Experience point penalty.  You'll further have a great UMD score, top out all your Trap skills, and have an excellent way to generate sneaks through your Terrifying Rage.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Thanks syrath for the clarification about the epic shadow lord...guess I'll keep EWS then<br><br>Grizz, thanks for the compliments...a praise from the dwarflord is something indeed <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>Your suggestion is a real good one, lack of UMD and damage output are indeed a problem with the build. Defenses are good as you said, but this little savage is lacking in dishing out pain. I would still keep 1 lvl SD for Hips, so I would build something on the lines of Barb 15/Rogue 24/SD 1. <br>One could also drop fighter altogether at the cost of WS, EWS and get 3 lvls rogue instead (and raising SD to 20th) at the right moment to get SD earlier and UMD/Set traps plus a weak sneak.<br>Among the reasons I went SD heavy there are RP reasons and the fact I didn't see this class combo used on a dex route up to ED/SC5.<br><br>An off topic question (please forgive me...somehow it is related to the build anyhow <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ): is it true that true seeing doesn't reveal concealed characters anymore? I read somewhere they changed it recently...<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò
