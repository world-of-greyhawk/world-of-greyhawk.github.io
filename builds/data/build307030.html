I don't usually make classes that require alignment shifts however, I recently did a request for a clanmate on the server I play on. I figured the build was unique enough it deserved to be used by more then 1 person, so here it is:<br><br>Bard(16), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Dwarven Defender(14), Dwarf, True Neutral<br><br>STR: 15 (36)<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 12 (14)<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 12 (14)<br>CHA: 14 (16)<br><br><br>01: Bard(1): Toughness<br>02: Bard(2)<br>03: Bard(3): Dodge<br>04: Bard(4): STR+1<br>05: Bard(5)<br>06: Bard(6): Power Attack<br>07: Bard(7)<br>08: Bard(8): Str+1<br>09: Dwarven Defender(1): Weapon Focus, {Defensive Stance}, *Alignment Change*<br>10: Red Dragon Disciple(1)<br>11: Red Dragon Disciple(2)<br>12: Red Dragon Disciple(3): Str+1, Cleave<br>13: Red Dragon Disciple(4)<br>14: Red Dragon Disciple(5)<br>15: Red Dragon Disciple(6): Great Cleave<br>16: Red Dragon Disciple(7): Str+1<br>17: Red Dragon Disciple(8)<br>18: Dwarven Defender(2): Improved Critical, {Defensive Awareness I}<br>19: Dwarven Defender(3)<br>20: Dwarven Defender(4): Str+1<br>21: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Epic Weapon Focus<br>22: Red Dragon Disciple(10)<br>23: Dwarven Defender(5)<br>24: Dwarven Defender(6): Str+1, Overwhelming Critical<br>25: Dwarven Defender(7)<br>26: Dwarven Defender(8)<br>27: Dwarven Defender(9): Blind Fight<br>28: Dwarven Defender(10): str+1<br>29: Dwarven Defender(11)<br>30: Dwarven Defender(12): Great Strength I<br>31: Dwarven Defender(13)<br>32: Dwarven Defender(14): str+1, Devastating Critical<br>33: Bard(9): Curse Song, *Alignment Change*<br>34: Bard(10)<br>35: Bard(11)<br>36: Bard(12): str+1, Great Strength II<br>37: Bard(13)<br>38: Bard(14)<br>39: Bard(15): Great Strength III<br>40: Bard(16): str+1<br><br>Hitpoints: 468<br>Skillpoints: 186<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 24/25/21<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +2, Traps: +1, Poison: +2<br>BAB: 26<br>AB (max, naked): 42 (melee), 28 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 24/34<br>Spell Casting: Bard(6)<br>Alignment Changes: 2<br><br>Concentration 43(45), Discipline 43(56), Perform 27(30), Tumble 40(42), UMD 33(36)<br><br>AB can be expected to hit 57 self buffed with +12 str and +5 GMW, AC can be expected to hit mid 60s to low 70s in +5 gear, DC on Dev can get up to 49 with +12 str<br><br>The saves aren't the best in the world but he asked for a Bard/RDD/DD Dever, so that's what he got lol<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 04/29/09 17:53</span></i></p>

NIce.  The only thing its missing is ELF! ( <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13422", "302405", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>the secret document post</a> )<br><br>i enjoy getting dev crit as early as possible (yes, that is why i played prc near the end cuz it allows you to get dev at 21 with pure divine caster classes <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">  ) so, the only small twink id do is move dev and blind fight.  you take blind so late anyway (out of necessity) that i cant see 3 more lvls make or break!<br><br>keep up the excellent work.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 11/21/08 01:31 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>But don't listen to everything avado said... </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 03/04/09 23:33</span></i></p>

Sorry, should have specified that Dev Crit is a bonus feat from DD that's why I had to take it so late..ran out of room lol

I like the idea here.  Just got to thinking of what could be done if dev. crit was passed over.  EDR jumped to mind, but that would take a pretty big stat reworking.  Still, I think it could be done, and I think it would work.  Just an idea though.  I don't really feel like fleshing it out.  Nice concept though.  Dude looks dangerous.<br><br>And, avado, if you're going to take advantage of the super secret racial exploit, I'd go human (heh, or halfling, you know, for coolness...).  There's your pre-epic Blind Fight.  That said, dwarven looks the best choice in my eyes.  The stat spread hurts just a wee bit, but if you did change things for EDR, then that stat spread becomes significantly less painful.  Anyways, just couldn't let a suggestion to be an elf go unchallenged...

Yeah I was thinking of a variant with EDR however, I just didn't feel it was comparable to a more traditional Dwarven Defender since for the most part they tend to have 30 BAB and aren't as tight for feats/stats.

Lol Revenant, we seem to be doing the same builds <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     I've played this split a few years back.  Didn't work on that server since this character was in most ways (on that server) inferior to Bard 26/BG 4/RDD 10 or Bard 20/CoT 10/RDD 10 since lower AC meant dying more often from a 1 on Devcrit compared to Bard/BG, but..<br><br>Works great for PvM since mobs don't have Devcrit as often and DR lets you tank them pretty well.<br><br>A different variation:  Bard 8/RDD 10/DD 22.  This one's all about DR and still gets +2 AB from his bard song.  A more traditional tank/damage soaker.<br><br>PS: at the cost of a few skillpoints you can get +1 BAB by taking 8 DD pre-epic.  And since you took so much concentration despite being unable to cast in heavy armor, you don't really need it.<br><br>PPS: Epic Prowess and Extend or Still Spell will net you the same AB as two Great Strength feats but will also give you Extend or Still spell.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bertuzzi on 03/05/09 04:11</span></i></p>
