The Nightblade (yeah I stole the name from Morrowind, sue me!)<br><br>The nightblade seamlessly blends the art of stealth, with skilled magic. She eschews direct combat, preferring to incapacitate and cripple her enemy while unseen, before unleashing her deadly attacks. Few see her coming, and those that do, have not the time to scream for aid.<br><br>Halfling<br>Chaotic Neutral<br><br>Str: 10<br>dex: 18<br>con: 14<br>int: 16 (all points here), ends at 32<br>wis: 8<br>cha: 8<br><br>*you can choose any school focus you like*<br><br>1: r1, toughness<br>2: w1 (generalist)<br>3: w2, weapon finesse<br>4: w3, int 17<br>5: w4<br>6: w5, empower spell, practiced spell-caster wiz<br>7: r2<br>8: r3, int 18<br>9: AT1, spell focus necro<br>10: AT2 <br>11: AT3<br>12: AT4, int 19, weapon focus short sword<br>13: AT5<br>14: AT6<br>15: AT7, greater spell focus necro<br>16: AT8, int 20<br>17: AT9<br>18: AT10: improved crit, short sword<br>19: w6<br>20: r4, int 21<br><br>At level 20: r4/at10/wiz6<br>3 attacks/round,<br>7d6 sneak attack, level 9 spells (due to a nice bug) and 20 effective caster levels.<br><br><br>Epic:<br>21: w7, epic spell focus necro<br>22: w8<br>23: w9<br>24: w10, great int I and II, int 24<br>25: w11 (epic spells)<br>26: w12<br>27: w13, great int III, int 25<br>28: w14, int 26<br>29: w15, great int IV, int 27<br>30: r5, great int V, int 28<br>31: w16<br>32: r6, int 29<br>33: w17, armor skin<br>34: r7<br>35: w18<br>36: r8, epic weapon focus ss, int 30<br>37: w19<br>38: r9<br>39: r10, improved eavasion, epic prowess<br>40: w20, great Int VI, int 32<br><br><br>Final: rogue10/wizard20/AT10<br><br><br>Skill selection: I maxed out Hide/MS at 42, spellcraft/con/lore at 43, 40 ranks in tumble.<br>That still leaves a ton of points. I set UMD at 25,  persuade at 15, about 10-15 in locks, 20 in<br>search and disable traps. Alternatively, this is a build that can potentially max craft trap and set strap, and you stand a good chance of making and setting epic traps.<br><br><br>AB:<br>21 (base)<br>3 (short sword focus+epic focus)<br>1 (prowess)<br>5 (GMW)<br>4 (dex bonus)<br>2 (dex bonus from Mantle of egregious might)<br>1 (minimum cat's grace)<br>4 greater heroism <br>2 (create tatoo)<br>= 43 (not bad for a wiz)<br><br>AC:<br>10 (base)<br>2 (armor skin)<br>8 (tumble)<br>8 armor (improved mage armor)<br>5 natural (spiderskin)<br>4 deflection (shield)<br>4 dodge (haste)<br>4 dodge (mantle of egregious might)<br>7 (dex bonus from natural, cat's grace, mantle of egregious might)<br>= 52 (not bad for a mage)<br><br>DC on wail: 10+9+6+11=36.

Soloed NWN OC, and HotU with no problems.<br>Level 9 spells, 10d6 sneak damage, improved evasion, high will and reflex save, excellent defensive abilties<br><br>Final DC almost as good as a pure wiz.<br><br>This character can generate sneak attacks any time, whether through stealth or magic. I have found a spell at every level, that can flatfoot an enemy, or even a group of enemies. Cast Greater Timestop, and you get 3 rounds of sneak attacks, that's 40d6 damage per round (with haste) for 3 rounds.<br><br>Monstrous number of skill points. One of the most versatile builds in the game.<br><br><br>Cons:<br>Looses a lot of epic feats, due to arcane trickster not having an epic progression... hint, hint  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>Only 34 caster levels, so you will have trouble with monks or custom SRs.<br><br>Gets epic spells. With 2 rings of clear thought +6, has a modified spellcraft of 60 and lore of 60 for 6 epic spells, which is average. You can drop armor skin/prowess, and take epic focus in lore and spellcraft. Without epic gloves of spellcraft though, you won't make the DC on spells like Tolodyne, or epic reflection.<br><br>Only focused in one school. You can drop the weapon feats and pick up another school.<br><br>When debuffed, looses a lot of AC and AB. But only arcane casters level 23+ should be able to dispel her,<br>which eliminates all the riff-raff from consideration.<br><br>No HipS. Can't have it all, but the unseen wanderer epic spell should help <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mr_Raider on 09/18/04 01:06</span></i></p>
