Interestingly, I found no matches at all for this class combination. Heh, of course if you look at some of the disadvantages of the build, there may be a reason. This build is totally feat-starved as it gets no bonus feats whatsoever. Anyway, here's an evil bugger that has some real potential if he doesn't get debuffed:<br><br>Black Skald<br><br><b>Playable from level 1, PvM</b><br><br>Bard 15/CLC 15/BG 10<br><br>Human, NE, or CE<br><br>STR 14 (26)<br>DEX 8<br>CON 12<br>INT 12<br>WIS 14 (18)<br>CHA 14<br><br>1 )Bard1: Power Attack/Cleave<br>2 )Bard2<br>3 )CLC1: Knockdown<br>4 )CLC2: STR (17)<br>5 )CLC3<br>6 )CLC4: Extend Spell <br>7 )Bard3<br>8 )CLC5: STR (18)<br>9 )CLC6: Empower Spell<br>10)BG1<br>11)BG2<br>12)Bard4: Weapon Focus/ STR (19)<br>13)BG3<br>14)BG4<br>15)CLC7: Improved Critical<br>16)CLC8: STR (20)<br>17)Bard5<br>18)Bard6: Curse Song<br>19)Bard7<br>20)Bard8: STR (21)<br><br>21)BG5: Epic Weapon Focus<br>22)Bard9<br>23)BG6<br>24)BG7: GRT STR I(22)/ WIS (15)<br>25)CLC9<br>26)CLC10<br>27)Bard10: Epic Prowess<br>28)Bard11: WIS (16)<br>29)CLC11<br>30)CLC12: GRT STR II (23)<br>31)Bard12<br>32)Bard13: WIS (17)<br>33)CLC13: GRT STR III (24)<br>34)CLC14<br>35)Bard14<br>36)CLC15: GRT STR IV (25)/ WIS (18)<br>37)Bard15<br>38)BG8<br>39)BG9: Armor Skin <br>40)BG10: STR (26)<br><br>HPs: 282 (no rerolls) Max: 340<br><br>Saves (vs spells)<br>Fort: 25 (33)<br>Refl: 20 (28)<br>Will: 28 (36)<br><br>Add 2 to all saves with Bard Song active.<br><br>Unbuffed AB: +39 (buffed, it can reach +61)<br><br>AC with mundane plate &amp; tower shield: 28<br><br>Damage with mundane battleaxe: (1-8 +14) + 5 (Grtr Magic Wpn) + various CLC buffs + 3 (Bard Song) + Darkfire<br><br>3d6 sneak attack<br><br>Skills:<br><br>Perform: 22<br>Spellcraft: 39<br>Tumble: 40<br>UMD: 38<br>Discipline: 43<br>Taunt: 26<br><br><b>Disadvantages:</b><br><br>Totally reliant on buffs<br>If he's dispelled (which will be easy enough for a high level caster), he's screwed.<br>No Divine Might or Divine Shield, but it's easy enough to drop a couple feats and fiddle with the levelling to get them.

Its funny cinn, I did make one of these types a long time ago for a lv 20 cap server (well 20 by non-rp means).  I went 10 cleric/8bg/2bard. I went this way to exploit the limited itms available AND since he was a charisma-based meleeist, to gain godly charisma bonus' (+6 before spells is godly when +2 itms are the rule).  <br><br>Peace

between the big three epic combat feats (EWF, Epic Prowess, and Armor Skin), I prefer taking Armor Skin before Epic Prowess under the theory that AB and AC are sort of mirrors to each other and Armor Skin = 2 to 1 better.  Does your analysis differ (obviously it does) and why?

I think you have to look at the ultimate ratio to determine which has more value.  Armor Skin having 2 points and Epic Prowess having 1 would indicate that the game designers, at least, feel it is more important to have AB than AC.

You have to take into account the dice roll needed for you to hit your opponents and for your opponents to hit you. Since you can generally get AC-boosting gear/spells easier (by this I mean you've got 5 types that you can boost) than AB, it's usually better to get your AB up in order to be sure you can land as many hits as possible. In a scenario like you describe, even if your AC is through the roof, if you've got 24 attacks against you every round, you're going to get hit regardless (there <i>will</i> be 20s rolled by your opponents for autohits).<br><br>In almost all cases, it's harder to raise your AB to a significant degree than your AC. In fact, if I'm strapped for epic feats, Armor Skin is usually the first one I look at dropping. That's just my personal take on it. Others (like yourself) feel the AC boost is of more value. Whichever you like, I say take that one first.  <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;I wasn't attacking Cinn -- good grief, what standing would I have for that -- I was trying to flesh out the analysis behind his choice because, well, I respect him as a builder.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>For your benefit, and that of FinneousPJ, I never felt you were attacking me.

For all other types, the highest overrides the lowest of the same type. In your example, if you had plate mail +4 and put on Bracers of Armor +3, the bracers would do nothing, as they both have the same enhancement type (armor), and the +4 on the plate would override the +3 on the bracers.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
