I had never played a truly enjoyable pure melee character, and certainly, have never considered a barbarian.  I was checking the prc manual looking for a good initial class to start my prc career and noticed the legendary dreadnought.  WOW!  A prc class where the minimum lvl you need is 26!!!  (bab 23).  So i had a target!  If you havent seen this class, it can be feat demanding.  Then I saw this class, battlerager!  UMM... all I can say is WOW!  These 2 together! OMG!  LOL   <br><br>There is a really sick synergy among these 3 classes.  And, as the char develops, we get some things that are just wrong!!  I'll highlight some of those as we go.<br><br>I will * those feats/skills that are required for battlerager and/or ld, cuz there are lots of 'em.<br><br>Dwarf*  alignment: CN (any barbarian will do)<br><br>str18 int14 con14 wis10 cha6  dex10<br>B=barb  R=battlerager   LD=legendary dreadnought<br><br>01 B1   WF:battleaxe (lore 2)*<br>02 B2<br>03 B3   Power Attack*<br>04 B4   s19<br>05 B5   intimidate8*<br>06 B6   Cleave*<br>07 B7<br>08 B8   s20<br>09 B9   toughness*<br>10 R1 <br>11 R2  &lt;AoC&gt; &lt;KD&gt;<br>12 R3  intimdate15*  Imp crit:battleaxe* s21<br>13 R4  &lt;IKD*&gt; &lt;great cl*&gt;<br>14 B10<br>15 B11  Lightning Reflex*<br>16 B12  s22<br>17 R5  &lt;armor skin&gt;<br>18 B13  Blind Fight<br>19 B14<br>20 B15  s23<br>21 B16  EWF: battleaxe<br>22 R6<br>23 R7<br>24 R8  epic prowess &lt;ferocious prowess&gt; s24<br>25 R9<br>26 LD1<br>27 LD2  overwhelming crit<br>28 LD3 &lt;epic toughness I&gt; s25<br>29 LD4 &lt;epic DR I&gt;<br>30 LD5 Dev crit/ Great str I s26<br>31 LD6<br>32 LD7 s27<br>33 LD8 &lt;epic fortitude&gt; Gr str II s28<br>34 LD9 &lt;epic DR II&gt;<br>35 LD10  Gr str III  s29<br>36 LD11  Gr str IV   s31<br>37 LD12<br>38 LD13 &lt;epic toughness II&gt;<br>39 LD14 &lt;epic DR III&gt; Gr str V s 32<br>40 R10    gr StrVI   s34<br><br>Skills<br>Dis43 Conc40  Intimidate15 Tumble40 spellcraft20 heal24<br><br>AB: base 30 + wf/ewf 2 + epic prowess 1 + ferocious prowess 1 + str bonus 12 = 46/41/36/31  <br>AC: 10 + 8 tumble + 2 armor skin = 20 WOOOT!! jk<br>Dam : d8 +12<br>saves : F 31  R 18 W 16<br><br>NOw, here is where we look at it!!<br>Why did I start with 18 str? For maximum effect. I guess I could have went 17 with more con, but thats up to you.  Remember, you get a freebie with DR without havin to qualify for it!  With Toughness you get 15 per lvl or 600 hps, with 2 epic toughness 2 you get 640 which isnt shabby.  The intelligence is to get the skills.  And, strictly from a RP sense, a character like this would be rather intelligent.  The Dreadnought just strikes me as a wise fighter type.  Oh, to get the skills you need to do some rather silly things.<br>1) barbarian gets intimidate (as does rager) so those r easy. <br>2) Barbarian gets Heal (the others do not) so you max heal at lv 21 (which works anyway, cuz the rest of the skills are taken <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   )<br>3) rager gets Conc AND TUMBLE <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">     <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">   hence the last lvl<br>4) spellcraft can be started after lv 21 if you wish.  Up til then you are puttin skills to heal and int.<br><br>OH!  Did I mention unstoppable and unmovable?  Think DD on steroids!  Well, not quite but a very nice bonus!  PLUS 8 or so rages (both barb and rager). <br><br>OH! AND EPIC DR !!!! I think you get something like 11 DR, which isnt huge, but you aint a defender here.<br><br>Weakness: NO casting <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">    Im a cleric at heart.  Weak will and reflex saves (but you get uncanny so..)  Is basically a one trick pony : IF IT MOVES, KILL IT!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">  <br><br>There is another rather upsetting quirk I discoverd.  Why no Dwarfaxe? IT is MOST fitting. After all battleragers and kuldjargh (AXE IDIOTS) (direct quote, btw).  It turns out that Legendary dread has a bug.  IT does NOT recognize improve crit:dwarfaxe as a qualifier for the class  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  .   I was VERY pissed about that, but what can you do.<br><br>I think I hit all the points. IF i missed any, let me know.  <br><br>*edit* forgot the sickest of them all : AURA OF COURAGE!  enough said.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"> <br><br>Thanks for takin the time to read my first PRC.<br><br>Peace<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 03/15/06 05:23</span></i></p>

You forgot that Rager Level 10 give you Terrifying Rage. Given that and the Gr Str bonus feat, and that tumble only need to go to 40, I might move that up to 37 to get TR earlier.<br><br>I might also drop Barb level 16 for another Legendary Dreadnaught level - gets you another Epic bonus feat, and only costs 1 rage per day.<br><br>Nice build - that's one mean little dwarf.<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 03/16/06 15:48</span></i></p>

Dropping barb16 for rager11 is the answer.  You take it as shown above and you get dev crit at 25, which if im not mistaken, is a GREAT lv for a non-halforc or rdd character.  You could take LD 15 at 40 for the extra feat, but you would loose on tumble conc dumps, and get only a gr str, which is an odd number.  Its up to you. <br><br>Peace<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->
