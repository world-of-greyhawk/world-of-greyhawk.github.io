I'm not a fan of Elves - yeah I know, that's a shock. However, I've often said they'd be best suited to the Rogue class as their favored class. With that in mind, I've built a pretty basic FTR/Rogue template using Elf as the race and it turns out it's probably one of the few Elf builds I'd not mind playing.<br><br>Not a lot to say about it other than it's a straight-forward FTR/Rogue. Decent skills, good dual-wield AB, HS for the bonus GRT DEX feat, good sneak attack (10d6), and no XP penalty. HPs aren't too bad at all considering it's an Elf and has a lot of Rogue levels.  Saves aren't great, but the UMD gives options to cover the weak points.<br><br>FTR 20/Rogue 19/HS 1<br><br>Playable from level 1 to 40, PvM.<br><br>Elf, any non-evil<br><br>STR: 16 (18)<br>DEX: 17 (32)<br>CON: 12<br>INT: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>CHA: 8<br><br>1 )Rogue1: Two Weapon Fighting<br>2 )FTR1: Weapon Focus:Handaxe<br>3 )Rogue2: Ambidexterity<br>4 )FTR2: Weapon Finesse/ DEX (18)<br>5 )FTR3<br>6 )Rogue3: Knockdown<br>7 )Rogue4<br>8 )FTR4: Weapon Specialization/ DEX (19)<br>9 )FTR5: Improved Knockdown<br>10)Rogue5<br>11)FTR6: Improved Two Weapon Fighting<br>12)Rogue6: Toughness/ DEX (20)<br>13)Rogue7<br>14)FTR7<br>15)FTR8: Iron Will/ Blind Fight<br>16)Rogue8: DEX (21)<br>17)Rogue9<br>18)FTR9: Alertness<br>19)FTR10: Improved Critical<br>20)Rogue10: Improved Evasion/ DEX (22)<br>   <br>21)Rogue11: GRT DEX I (23)<br>22)HS1: GRT DEX II (24)<br>23)FTR11<br>24)FTR12: GRT DEX II (25)/ Epic Weapon Focus/ DEX (26)<br>25)Rogue12<br>26)FTR13<br>27)Rogue13: Defensive Roll/ Epic Dodge<br>28)FTR14: Epic Weapon Specialization/ STR (17)*<br>29)Rogue14<br>30)Rogue15: GRT STR I (18)*<br>31)FTR15<br>32)Rogue16: ESF:Discipline/ DEX (27)<br>33)FTR16: GRT DEX IV (28)/ Armor Skin<br>34)Rogue17<br>35)FTR17<br>36)FTR18: GRT DEX V (29)/ Epic Prowess/ DEX (30)<br>37)Rogue18<br>38)FTR19<br>39)Rogue19: GRT DEX VI (31)/ ESF:Spellcraft<br>40)FTR20: Epic Toughness I**/ DEX (32)<br><br>*These can be switched to DEX if desired for +1 AC and +1 AB, or CON for 40 HPs and +1 Fort saves.

Not really mucg to add, as you say, it's quite basic. I get some blurry visions with elves wielding axes though, just doesn't sit right. <br><br>I would easily give up 1 AB and AC(HS) for HiPS anyday though. To me that is a no-brainer in a build with 19 rogue. I know it had become even more basic, but still.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Yeah, you could easily do so. Just switch out Iron Will and Alertness and take SD instead of HS. You could even preserve AB and AC by leaving STR at 16 and raising DEX at levels 28 and 30 instead.<br><br>But, there are a bunch of FTR/Rogue/SD builds already and I really don't like using the HiPS spam (and besides, SD is way too obvious a choice, isn't it?)<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Yeah, more HS could easily replace some Fighter levels, you even took Epic Toughness which I see as a filling feat to take when you have too much feats.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;I get some blurry visions with elves wielding axes though, just doesn't sit right. </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>It's only a handaxe, any civilization needs to chop wood, even those skinny elves, at least it's not a Waraxe (or dare to try Dwarven Waraxe <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   good thing that one's impossible).<br><br>The build is quite ok, not much else to add.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 08/12/06 23:43</span></i></p>

Yeah, you could definitely slip in the extra 4 HS levels (and maybe pick up an ESF feat as the bonus feat). The only reason I didn't go that route is the Epic Toughness feat gives the character over 400 HPs. This is one of the few times I've used that feat in a build and not actually lamented the fact.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 08/12/06 23:53</span></i></p>

This looks pretty solid for a pointy-ear.  I'm glad to see no XP penalty since that is usually an issue with these folk.  Taking 5 HS would most likely throw the xp monkeywrench into the build, albeit much later in its career.  I'd just as soon keep Fighter in the build unless you were in a seriously deprived magic environment.  It progresses fast, looks extrememly playable pre-epic, and maintains good damage outside of sneaks.  I even see an SC IV alternative near the end of the build, but I would keep it as is.  <br><br>Well done, Cin.  Even after all these years, you still have something left in the tank, even when the tank has nothing left for us.  It saddens me that this era's end draws nigh, and I wonder at my wherewithal to ever leave it.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I wouldn't put too much stock in NWN 2.  When it's finally released it will only go to level 20 and we'll have to wait a while for epic levels (I'm guessing they'll have to put it in the first expansion).  Also, from reading the boards, It seems PWs will be difficult if not impossible to create due to engine limitations caused by the improved graphics and finer mesh sizes (something like only 4-6 areas can be active at a given time).  Even then we'll have to wait for the CC to come out too.  We might be stuck with NWN for good year to come, plenty of time to think up even wierder builds.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
