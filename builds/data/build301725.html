This build is for all those PWs out there that have made happy adjustments to the Shadowdancer class.  I’ve played in several now where Shadow Evade has been given some actual use, and the duration is based on level, or have given Shadowdaze more teeth, or have altered the Shadowlord summons, and so on.  Even if HiPS has been changed, given a cool-down period, or nerfed outright, this kind of character can still enjoy success.  To explain the goal of this kind of character, it’s simply to maximize the utilities of the Shadowdancer class while still maintaining a healthy melee presence.  <br><br>Basically, we wanted an assassin-like character, except instead of using Death Attack, we use Dev Crit.  We maximize SD levels to give us the most out of Shadow Evade and to grab that great DR it grants at higher levels, as well as that juicy Shadowdaze DC.  Even in Full Plate this character will have the same steath score as if he were naked and dex-based with a 26 Dex.  We use the the SD bonus feats in a way one not normally sees SD feats used—for Epic Skill Focus feats.  With 5 of those coming in Epic levels, there is lots of room for customization. Hide and Move Silently are a must, and the 3rd I nodded to the Epic Summons, and then I choose Taunt and Discipline because those things are important to me and my playstyle.  I can easily see someone giving those up for Listen/Spot or UMD/Search, etc….<br><br>I’ve done this kind of character before, such as in The Assassin King or the Zhentarim Field Agent, in which Strength-based stealthers launch from the shadows to lay waste with their sneak attacks.  Since it hasn’t been done this way, I thought I’d post the full-blooded SD version.  I’ve done other versions that were also quite fun, and did a Halfling version (had to swap Rogue for Bard) that got an even better Stealth score.  Dwarf also works well with this, but you have to give up 43 skill points.  The non-Dev Crit version got a slightly better AB and finished with Improved Expertise and Improved Disarm, which may be a nice option if Dev Crit is banned on your server.  If Shadowdancers haven’t been given incentives to go deeper into levels on your PW, then this build may not be for you, though would still be playable and unique.<br><br>Halberd was chosen for coolness factor, though admittedly Greatsword would be better for crit efficiency.  What’s nice about the Halberd is that it does to damage types, and 1.69 finally got that 2 damage type bug fixed.  Comments and flames welcome.

I'm starting to think avado will make a grizzled_dwarflord's fan club or something. It's starting to become a bit creepy.<br><br>Ok, Shadowdancer 25, definitely not something I would ever build but you rounded pretty decent combat stats for it. Where is Knockdown? you take too much Skill Focuses instead, at least drop one for KD, I bet it will be more useful.<br><br>As usual I love Halberds, great weapon choice.

I have been waiting to see a STR based SD for years.  I was thinkin' ranger, but the plethora of feats here works nicely.  Gotta love the ESF: taunt as icing.

It is not often you see a str based SD build, and it is even more rare to see a SD heavy build without ED and SCV.<br><br>What high SD builds get is  a lot of defensive feats for free, plus epic feats every 3 lvls.<br>You don't go the dex route and aim for ED and SCV, but you have shown a different use for all the feats.<br><br>You have opened up yet another door for us! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
