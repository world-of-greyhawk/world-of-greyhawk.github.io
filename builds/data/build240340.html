Back in the day, I used to read this crazy Chinese comic called "Drunken Fist" (produced by Jademan Comics).  One of my favorite protagonists was Chek Fai.  A kung fu artist that fought mainly with a spear, but also fought unarmed if his spear was unavailable.<br><br>The characters and their Kung Fu styles were colorful and iconic ("you don't stand a chance against the Third Form of Blazing Sun Kung Fu!!").  So just for kicks, I thought I'd try to reproduce Chek Fai as best I could.  <br><br>I know that only 6 monk levels seems pretty small for a Kung Fu type of character, but the comic book characters abilities far exceeded the standard D&amp;D Monk abilities, so I thought I'd take a bit of artistic license.<br><br>Chek Fai (Cleric 24 / Monk 6 / CoT 10)<br>Playable 1-40<br>PvM (RP build)<br><br>Human<br>Lawful, non-evil (should be good to fit character)<br><br>Str 16 (32)<br>Dex 14<br>Con 12<br>Wis 15 (20)<br>Int 10<br>Cha 8<br><br>Cleric Domains: War &amp; Trickery<br><br>1 Cleric (1) - Extend Spell, Blind Fight (or Toughness)<br>2 Cleric (2)<br>3 Monk (1) - Weapon Focus: Spear<br>4 Cleric (3) - WIS 16<br>5 Cleric (4)<br>6 Cleric (5) - Empower Spell<br>7 Cleric (6)<br>8 Monk (2) - STR 17<br>9 Cleric (7) - Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br>10 Cleric (8)<br>11 Cleric (9)<br>12 Monk (3) - Improved Critical: Spear,  STR 18<br>13 Cleric (10)<br>14 Cleric (11)<br>15 Cleric (12) - Improved Critical: Unarmed<br>16 Cleric (13) - STR 19<br>17 Monk (4)<br>18 Cleric (14) - Extra Stunning Fists<br>19 Cleric (15)<br>20 Cleric (16) - STR 20<br><br>21 CoT (1) - Great Strength I<br>22 CoT (2) - Epic Weapon Focus: Spear*<br>23 CoT (3)<br>24 CoT (4) - Great Strength II, Epic Weapon Focus: Unarmed*, STR 23<br>25 CoT (5)<br>26 CoT (6) - Great Wisdom I*<br>27 Monk (5) - Great Strength III<br>28 CoT (7) - STR 25<br>29 CoT (8) - Great Wisdom II*<br>30 CoT (9) - Great Strength IV<br>31 CoT (10) - Great Wisdom III*<br>32 Cleric (17) - STR 27<br>33 Cleric (18) - Great Strength IV<br>34 Cleric (19)<br>35 Cleric (20)<br>36 Cleric (21) - Great Strength III, STR 30<br>37 Monk (6)<br>38 Cleric (22)<br>39 Cleric (23) - Great Strength IV, Great Wisdom IV*<br>40 Cleric (24) - STR 32<br><br>naked<br>AB 39 - [BAB 25 + STR 11 + WF 1 + EWF 2]<br>AC 26 - [Base 10 + DEX 2 + WIS 5 + Tumble 8 + Monk 1]<br><br>buffed<br>AB 56 - [39 + Emp Bulls 3 + Divine Favor 5 + GMW 5 + Aid 1 + Bless 1 + BT 2]<br>AC 37 - [26 + Emp Cats 3 + Emp Owls 3 + Magic Vestment 5]<br><br>Stunning Fist DC: 38 - [10 + 1/2CL 20 + buffed WIS 8]<br><br>HP 380<br><br>Fortitude 30<br>Reflex 26<br>Will 34<br>_________________<br><br>Build notes:<br>As noted above, this is just an RP type of build that I created to indulge the follies of my youth. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   However, it actually seems a pretty decent build.<br><br>There are a couple of big weaknesses in this build. The first being it's reliance on Cleric buffs.  Without your buffs you are going to be hurting. And the second is the AC; again without buffs, your AC is pretty horrible.<br><br>Since Chek Fai would often fight unarmed, I also put a focus in unarmed combat and added the extra stunning attacks to give another combat option. As you can see in the above stats the DC isn't too terribly bad.  You can actually get an *effective* DC of 41 if you take advantage of the Cleric spells Battletide (-2 to saves) and Prayer (-1 to saves).  It's nothing to write home about, but it isn't too shabby either.<br><br>I went back and forth on how to split the Monk and Cleric levels. I wanted to put more Monk in, but with the dependance on Cleric buffs, it seemed prudent to keep the Cleric levels as high as possible. Plus, the unarmed combat is the secondary fighting style, anyway.<br><br>I went back and forth as to whether  it was better to have a natural 4th APR or utilize the Divine Power 4th attack at full BAB.  I decided on the latter.  Either way ended up with the same AB at level 40.  This way, though ended with a strength of 32 instead of 28, netting some additional damage.<br><br>There are a quite a few other builds utilizing varying levels of these 3 classes, but as mine was built with a specific flavor and fictional character in mind, I figured I'd go ahead and post it.<br><br>If one wanted to play it from the ground up, I would recommend staying in armor until level 4 or 5 when you can buff your AC to nearly match plate.<br><br>Cheers
