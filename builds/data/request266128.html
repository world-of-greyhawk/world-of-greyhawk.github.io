Bards use CHA and Dwarves get a -2 CHA penalty at creation, if you want spell casting ability you would probably be better off with Cleric or Wizard. Some one is going to ask you for more info on the type of character you want...so what exactly are you looking for?<br>We see spell casting abilities and you said you were disappointed with the ab and ac from the build you tried...what is the minimum you would like both of those at?

"The Mystic Wall" by Cinnabar Din looks like a good fighting/spell casting Dwarf. <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "212877", "0", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> And since you stated you dont play Dwarves much it will let you experience the Dwarven Defender class as well. I am not an expert on spell swords, but looking through the search engine real quick, this one stood out.

Dude, you've made an excellent choice, dwarves are cool.<br><br>Now, we do need to know exactly what kind of dwarf you'd like, and in what magical environment you're playing.<br><br>Anyway, Dwarven Defenders rock, so I'll show you my own:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "248564", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Dwarven Abomination (Cleric 17 / Fighter 1 / Dwarven Defender 22)</a><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "245491", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Terrifying Tank (Barbarian 16 / Fighter 6 / Dwarven Defender 18)</a><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "265734", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Woodland Dwarf (Ranger 22 / Fighter 4 / Dwarven Defender 14)</a><br><br>There are other good builds around such as:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "220964", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Draconic Wall (Bard 8/ Red Dragon Disciple 10/ Dwarven Defender 22)</a> by Kail Pendragon<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "215900", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Hearth Guard: Fighter8/CoT10/Dwarven Defender22</a> by grizzled_dwarflord<br>Or with Dev crit as <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "118910", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script><br>The Anvil</a> by Mithdradates<br><br>I also like the Monk / Cleric / Dwarven Defender configuration, but the current builds for that in the index are DEX based like <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "231244", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Lord of the Holy Fist (cleric 15 - monk 7 - dwarvern defender 18)</a> by krsboss, while I think a Dwarven Defender has no need for AC since he's got DR and should go STR based.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/15/07 03:17</span></i></p>

Thanks for all the suggestions! Yea i see your point about the -2 to char! <br><br>The server i play on there are quite alot of items with bonuses, Clerics have been nerfed quite alot but still are good! Every seems to be playing Bard/bg/rdd combo or Pally/sorc/pm (no lawful -chaotic alignment shift)<br><br>AC is needed, and because of all these dam PMs (i really hate them) so is high ab. <br>With items id like 70-80ac and 60+ab.. ac bonuses on items amounts (as in not including the actual ac bonus from e.g.wearing Heavy armour) to 25!

If they're AC and AB are problems, just bypass it.  Let them hit you.  Make a Dwarf with EDR and 26 levels of a caster class, and let them beat themselves to death on your damage shields.  Toss is some PM so they can't crit you, and you'll be fine.  Something like Wizard26/Ftr4/PM10 should work.  You won't need to worry about your AB, and you won't need to worry about their AC.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

My "Ok I'll Tank" build uses that concept (shameless plug).  It's an Epic Gargoyle/Undead Lord build.  Uses Acid Sheath and Elemental Shield.  You actually want low ac on that type of build.  Sad thing is... it's not a dwarf when it fights.

I made a build with that on mind, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "238107", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Arcane Wall V2 (Wizard 22 / Dwarven Defender 18)</a> high DR and let them hit you while you're covered with Mestil's Acid Sheath and Elemental Shield, at the same time you attack with spells, and it works pretty nice in PvM, but it doesn't really works works in PvP, players simply avoid stupidly hitting you. Against another caster is quite tricky though, say, the Paladin/Sorcerer/PM, it's quite hard to fight those, with my build I ended pretty much standing as a weaker caster, and usually a high DC caster will beat a DR caster easily, it's not an assured loss though, when I fought mages with my build I was able to win often against unexperienced casters that spam IGMS, because my build has a much higher HP than practically any caster.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/15/07 16:54</span></i></p>

Taking "Disarm" as a feat helps with that type of build.  Disarm provokes an AoO.  Improved Disarm would not be good to take since that does not provoke the AoO.  And, if you disarm them... bonus for you!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
