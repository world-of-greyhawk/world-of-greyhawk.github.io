You want a BAB of 15 at level 20 if you are making a cleric, this lets you use the divine power attack (4th attack at full AB).<br><br>I wouldn't necessarily go cleric/monk/bg, unless you're looking to make a caster cleric in which case 32/4/4 might work.  But 36/4 of something would work better, in all likelihood.  Caster levels are good in caster builds.<br><br>If you want to make a buffed melee cleric, 26/x/x is a good idea.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

You can freely join the army even if you are a cleric of The Dark Majesty. Verminaard himself is a Cleric of Takhisis you know. Her High priest sells a nice whip btw. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>The ring of takhisis gives you a nice sum of bonus spell-slots too. It's PvP all the way if you want and find legal opposition. As for those knights, remember that most have Pally levels which is a pain in the famous buttocks when they do hit you.<br><br>But still, I think the build you visiualize seems sweet. Cleric/Monk with high WIS for AC can be really good, but you'll face a lot of opponents with good saves. Very often your enemies might consist of Dwarves from Thorbardin, Elves which can be anything possible and knights, often loaded with Pally and/or CoT. This is for PvP, mind you. So a buffing Cleric might be just as good, perhaps Cleric25/Fighter some and tumble class some.<br><br>I play Verminaard as a STR-based Cleric, but he has some restrictions on both armor and build that you won't ever have to follow. <br><br>More advice, don't take mace as weapon, I have found most types of good weapons, but never a mace. Not even Verminaards Nightbringer. If you want more info, PM me here or in the DLROH forums. Or post specific build questions here. you cover all the server rules in the initial post, so others should be as qualified as I. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.
