Lately I've been looking at the idea of a dragon shape being able to pummel through mages with full buffs.  The ancient green dragon would be perfect for this with its damage immunity to acid.<br><br>The first major problem is greater sanctuary.  Druids are unable to strip it and while a caster is in it they are invulnernable to all targeted attacks except for provoked attacks (like when he pickpockets (doesn't break GS) in it).<br><br>The second is SR, dragon shape can get up to 52 SR (40 Druid) but that SR can be stripped quickly with a breach.<br><br>Third and final is elemental shield.  Though a green dragon is immune to the acid it will take significant fire damage each blow.<br><br>I have tried to overcome some of these obstacles with speed, the faster you get to the caster the faster you can immobolize him.  In this case SR doesn't matter as much as  the wizard will be hard pressed to both strip the defenses and cast an aggressive spell.  The neat thing though about dragon shape is that it has a high enough strength to resist bigby's to an extent.<br><br><br>My thought for a build is as follows<br><br>Human<br>Monk 26/Druid 14<br><br>str 14<br>dex 8<br>con 10<br>wis 18 (31)<br>int 14<br>cha 8<br><br>Monk speed increases on epic levels 23, 26, 29, etc. so this build will have the maximum monk speed but no haste.<br><br>Feats<br>Luck of Heroes<br>Strong Soul<br>Blind Fight<br>Disarm (to provoke attacks of opportunity)<br>Zen archery<br>Power and Improved Power Attack<br>Improved Crit (unarmed) (works with dragon claw)<br>ISR 4<br><br>The final stats are<br><br>SR 44<br>BAB 25/22/19/16/13<br><br>Ranged AB 35/32/29/26/23 (+4 to AB with owl's insight)<br>Dragon AB 44/41/38/35/32 (Bull's strength gives max +2)<br>+2 to AB in wilderness area<br><br>320 HP (440 + 100 temporary added with dragon shape)<br><br>Dragon Shape AC: 66<br><br>Saves (Fort/Will/Reflex)<br>Regular(24/34/22)<br>Dragon (35/34/36)<br>+8 vs spells, +1 vs death magic.<br><br>A level 40 pure arcane mage with ESF, Great Int/Cha X, and max ability increase and +12 ability increase will have a level 9 spell DC of 45.  All level 9 fort saves are death magic so the only failure for fort and reflex is on a roll of 1 when in dragon shape.  Immunity to mind spells negates the general need for a high will.<br><br>BBoD is also near useless against this build because of the DR.<br><br>The three main unescapable problems are elemental shield, IGMs and greater sanctuary.<br><br>I am torn between upping the SR to 44 as opposed to 38 with three Epic Energy Resistance Feats toward Fire.<br><br>The basic plan is to plant a stunning fist DC 40 (44 with owl's insight), cancel the shift, plant a harm, and finish the mage off.  If any problems occur run away.  Fast speed is vital if there are multiple mages or other opponents.<br><br><br>I am pretty sure on the skill point distribution<br><br>Spellcraft 38 (40)<br>Tumble 40<br>Max on Hide, MS, Concentration, Discipline, and Lore<br>8 points remaining<br><br>I have tested the shape in mods but due to a slow connection speed  I am unable to determine the full effect from the mage's perspective, especially the shapeshift followed by an immediate set of stunning fists.  I know it works well lvl 40  pvm, but not sure about the pvp.  Of course large areas would be ideal for this build.<br><br>I'd appreciate any input in making this build.

Note that DS does incorporate armor into the shape. So you may want to wear Red Dragon Plate or some other fire-resistant armor to help with elemental damage.<br><br>TM

There are some set problems with the dragon.<br><br>You do get a good AB, but in a high magical environment forget about hitting, it just won't work. For that effect, a fully buffed mage with Epic Mage Armor and all can get good ACs.<br><br>You know, no matter who you are, you just can't do a thing aginst those godly PvP spells: Time Stop, Mordenkainen's Disjunction and Epic Warding, you just don't have <b>anything</b> to counter those spells.<br><br>For Stunning Fists I use <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "238749", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>my own</a> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">     that's a real working DC.<br><br>Shapeshift consumes a full round (once you shift, you need to end that round to start a new action, but I think if you're hasted you can cast a spell in the first half round and shift in the second half round, but you should test that), but de-shift is instant.<br><br>Buffed SR is nice, but after Mords they can spam IGMS, your base SR of 20 won't stop them. De-shift + Heal works great, you can even do it between spells with good timing, not even need to stun.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.
