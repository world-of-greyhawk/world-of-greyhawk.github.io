I really have no play experience with non-divine types, but here's an idea I was kicking around.  I'm aware it's not in official submission form - looking for more feedback before I commit the time to crossing Ts and dotting Is.  There's no builds like this and I'd like to know what's wrong with it.<br><br>Elven Illusionist 16 / PM 16 / CoT 8<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 18 + 7 + 4<br>Con 12<br>Int 16 + 3<br>Wis 10<br>Cha 8<br><br>Distribution Pre 20 is Wiz 4 PM 8 CoT 8 - this gives 16 BAB by 20.  <br><br>Feats<br>Weapon Focus- rapier<br>Imp Crit - rapier<br>Empower Spell<br>Maximize Spell<br>Weapon Finesse<br>Spell Penetration x2<br>Blind Fighting<br>Toughness<br>Extend Spell<br><br>Post-Epic Feats<br>3 Wizard<br>2 PM <br>7 Normal<br><br>Armor Skin<br>Epic Prowess<br>Epic Weapon Focus: Rapier<br><br>Epic Spell: Warding<br>Epic Spell: Mage Armor<br>Epic Spell: Greater Ruin<br>Epic Spell: Hellball<br>Epic Spell Penetration<br>Great Dex x 4<br><br>Ends up a finesse fighter with 29 natural dex, +5 from Maximized Cat's Grace is 34.

There's the Build request forum and the the General discussion forum to get feedback on unfinished build. This forum is only for complete and tested builds, written down in the proper format.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Sorry - I thought the build request forum was for something a little more passive than was I was presenting.  Plus I can't read, which makes forums difficult sometimes.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif">
