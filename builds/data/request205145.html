Well my character on a server I play on is a guard for the main town, so he has to deal with a bunch of pvpers, and considering it's technically an RP server it gets tough.<br><br>See he's currently lvl 32, and I'm looking for a re-level since he's pretty weak. I levelded him horribly, 1-5 paladin, 6-25 cleric, 26-30 paladin, 30-32 champion of Torm. So basically right now, he takes a ton of time to buff, and still gets dominated. <br><br>The server is a pretyt high magic server, magic weapons adn items are pretty common. Most things are maxed at +5, I do have a cloak of protection +7, and full plate +6. <br><br>Unfortunately this serveer is packed with powerbuilds that make little rp sense. i.e 7 bard 23 paladin 10 pm, with liek epic mage armour etc. Also players with 1-3 lvls of rogue are a common occurance. or dex chars with a couple lvls of wiz for true strike are common. But basically My character will be up against these types of builds. rogue 3/fighter 7/ wm 28. or rogue 19/ftr 20/sd 1 sort of things. Also the occasional mage. He might have to come across other power build type things.<br><br>So basically I would like a build that can hold his own, at least until some sort of back up arrives, vs. Weapon Masters, DC spells, and basically just powerbuilds that are cheesey and make no rp sense. Currently with his cleric buffs he can hold his own, but what I find is that because he's a guard usually he doens't get 10 minutes to buff up before the fight, he really only gets a few seconds. Which is why It was probably best to get rid of the cleric spells. <br><br>I was reading the Divine warrior build by Torias, which I really liked. I like that it isn't horrible powerbuilt, and It works with all the classes. So basically I was thinking somethign like that really for this character. <br><br>What I liked, are the HIgh saves, which is good for DC spells like implosion wail etc, also love divine shield adn might, because with a few seconds I can boost his dmg and AC which is great. Divine Wrath is also a favorite thing of mine. I could go with a wm build but I really like paladin builds as I love the high saves, they have saved me from Dev Crit, imposion, wail and all that many times. I also like charisma builds as Divine shield and might are great, also brilliant for saves too.<br><br>Anyway what I want to know is, is there another way to get these things, than with the Divine Warrior:<br><br>High saves,<br>Good ac, like 65+ with Divine Shield<br>Can hit pretty hard, don't neccesarily mean high vrits, just like basica dmg<br>has Paladin lvls for Holy avenger and perhaps 1st lvl spells<br>Is human (maybe Aasimar for 2 wis/+2 cha<br>High Disc<br>Charisma based<br>Is good from lvl 32+, I don't need him to be good from 1-32, because i'll be releveling, so just 32+<br>Where the classes make sense, and aren't powergames<br>So bassicaly can hold his own at least for a while, obviously he can't have huge saves, huge ac, huge damage, I just need a well rounded character that can hold his own for a fair amount of time.<br><br>As for equip I can get a hold of<br>Full plate +6<br>Gloves of str +2<br>Belt of str +4<br>2x rings of cha +2<br>Helm of cha +2<br>amulet of ac +2<br><br>As for weapons there are two holy avenger weapons on the server:<br>Greatsword ~ HA and Keen<br>Longsword ~ HA<br><br>okay so I basically described the Divine warrior, but just curious if there are other ideas out there.<br>_________________<br>~I am the wisest man on earth because I know one thing, and that is I know nothing.~<br>-Cairne

Given what you describe, I probably would not go with a high Smite build.  Unless all of your PvPers are evil, which they aren't if they're powergamers, Smite will not be that useful.  You can still go high CHA, and get Might/Shield/etc., but it won't be as effective as you're looking for.  For P/C/CoT, I believe you have 3 options:<br><br>1) Traditional STR build, focusing on Dev Crit and Weapon Power, using Smite, Divine Might, etc. as additional buffs when fighting the right opponent.  You can get a 26 STR/22 CHA type build which will give the heavy damage you're looking for.  Buffing will not be a problem.  Good for the all-around build, but weak against PM builds, etc.  This build would de-emphasize Cleric, take a good amount of CoT levels (save some for epic for add'l epic feats), probably at lvl 32 have something like P8/C9/CoT15 (with 11-12 CoT lvls in epic) and finish around P8/C10/CoT22.  Though not obvious, take Extra Turning as that will increase your numbers for Might &amp; Shield.  Try to maximize pre-epic BAB.<br><br>2) Go WIS/CHA.  Take at least 15 levels of Cleric for best buffing, raise CHA to 22 range as above for added buffs.  Doesn't sound like what you're looking for as you don't have time to buff, but very effective.  This build is great if you have time to buff or don't face a lot of sneak attackers.  You have so many buffs, you won't need to be fully buffed to be effective.  I would emphasize CoT here again over P.  You can also save more CoT bonus feats for epic as you won't need to get 19 or 20 BAB to be effective and can add more Cleric early.<br><br>3) Somewhere between.  Very tough to do as you need good stats in STR &amp; WIS &amp; CHA (recommend something like 26/16/18), but doable particularly as CoT has Great Wisdom as an epic feat.  6, 9 or 12 levels of Cleric would be fine, and give you a lot of weapons.  By level 32, I would recommend something like P12/C6/CoT16 or P9/C9/CoT16 (similar to 1).  More Paladin levels are necessary for high BAB and to keep CoT feats for epic on this build.  Having Smite around is a big help and nice alternative to this situation, but you probably wouldn't get Great Smite.  Still with an 18 CHA and the above, Smite would add 4 to your to-hit and 25-28 points of damage -- pretty darn nice for a buff.<br><br>Those are my thoughts anyway.  There are a ton of P/C/CoT builds in the build list.  Torias' is a nice build, but very focused and probably not as balanced as you might want for a PvP environment.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By jjellison on 07/23/05 02:29</span></i></p>
