I love this class split, but with alot testing I wound up with 18 base CHA instead of 16, and went for divine might over still spell when I had played this build.<br><br>Now, both have their uses and it's a very tough call - but why not move lasting inspiration to a bard bonus feat, and take divine might over epic skill focus: perform?  Though I can understand if this is done for RP reasons.  <br><br>But all in all, a great build. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Thanks very much.  The ESF Perform is fairly critical to the build, though.  You'll need it to get to Level 20 Bard Song (Perform 50) and to get to Level 25 Bard/Curse Song (+6 to AC, 75 Perform Skill required) with gear and buffs.  The build has strength that allows for good damage output and use of a rapier multiplies it fairly regularly.  <br><br>Ithacan

Maybe you could find a way to put in Artist and Skill Focus Perform for a total of +5 Perform (and +2 spot).  Probably have to dump 2 Epic Feats of Great Strength.  Artist can only be taken at lvl 1.<br><br>The extra perform (as you said) is very important to this build.  Going from 43 to 75 is a huge leap for items.  Not sure why you have 43 perform if you have ESF Perform.  Wouldn't you have saved skill points and maxed out that skill?  I'd guess it would be in the 50's at least.

The 43 allocated to Perform under Skill is to direct the build's allocation of points, not to indicate final rank in the skill.  Final rank would be 56 (43 + 10 ESF + 3 Cha)).  +6 charisma gear would get it to 62, Perform-enhancing gear would be required to get it higher. 62 buys you Level 22 bard song, which will add 11 points to the rank, still 2 shy of a level 25 bard song for your allies, level 25 curse song for your enemies.  You can trade Blind Fight for SF Perform and you are home free on that front.  65 Perform + 12 for bard song = 77.<br><br>The nuances will depend on your PW.  The perform is built to pretty tight tolerances.  <br><br>Thanks for the feedback.<br><br>Ithacan

YaY, another RDD/Bard build (I eh hem just love these guys): nice build, Ithacan; then, with this wonderful combo and 26 bard, just gets one's wings a flappin' <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> And there's def. something to be said for going for the "pinnacle" of song/curse (great focus), and at the same time, with all those great (undispellable) buffs, incl. great buffed AC and good, higly buffable AB, ... great job!! As to gear, it's out there, I've seen plenty of performance enhancing gloves for e.g., but as-is your pre-gear song is pretty darn mean already: this be one mean dragon alright, and I like it! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">          <br><br>(and here you go, a cool graphic to go along with your winged fiend, sing on, sing on! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">        <a href="http://www.xmission.com/%7Eashcraft/bradleywilliams/gallery/covers_window.php?4" target="_blank">Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 02/01/07 07:17</span></i></p>
