An old Dwarf sat at a table in a dimly lit tavern with  young adventurers  around him waiting to hear one of his famous tales.<br>"So, what tale do ye wish to hear this time?" asked the dwarf.<br>"Well, we were hoping to hear something different." said one of the adventurers.<br> The dwarf thought for a moment "I guess I should finally  tell ye a story about myself this time."<br>He began to tell the tale...<br><br>	The dwarves were rushing toward the mines grabbing what weapons they can as quickly as possible. The dwarves made it to the mines in time, when they arrived they saw a dwarf fighting off an army of drow.<br>"Good ye finally arrived" stated the lone dwarf. <br>"Didn't think we'd let ye have all of the fun did ye Tagnor," said another dwarf. The dwarves ran into the combat hacking, slashing, and bashing any of the drow's warriors they saw. <br>Tagnor went up to another who had just killed another drow and asked "The king, is he alright?"<br>"yeah he be alright, he's being guarded by your student, the one ye just finished training Tagnor." said the dwarf.<br>"Good, he should be able to handle the job," said Tagnor. Tagnor jumped straight back into the fight and slashed down 3 drow. It seemed they were winning the fight until a drow warrior showed excellent skill by taking down any dwarf that came at him.<br>"I'll handle this one," said Tagnor. He rushed toward the drow blade in hand. He ducked a slash then came up with an uppercut style on his blade. He was surprised to see it blocked though, the drow used his other had to slash at him with a hidden dagger. Tagnor tryed to dodge but still felt the blade pierce his armor. To the drows surprise, it didn't pierce the dwarves skin. Tagnor smiled.<br>"Is that the best you can do?" he asked with a laugh.<br>"You won't be laughing once you find your king dead" said the drow. Tagnor enraged by the drows comment attacked with his blade with such a force that the drows armor and shield seemed like paper to the blade. Once sure the drow was dead Tagnor headed to the kings chambers just to be safe.<br>	When he arrived in the kings chambers he saw the king dead with a poison dart in his chest and his student, Kelmvor holding a crossbow.<br>"Why ye, how dare ye kill the king!" shouted Tagnor.<br>"Great, now I'll have to get rid of you to," Kelmvor said. "If you must know I did it for the status, if I helped the drow they promised me a great offer." he said.<br>"Ye fool, everyone knows not to trust the drow!" he said, "and it will be you who'll loose this fight not me." He positioned himself in a defensive stance while Kelmvor rushed at at him with a warhammer. Kelmvor attacked furiously but Tagnor dodged every swing of the hammer, never moving from his one spot. Kelmvor attacked and left an opening in his guard, Tagnor used that opening at attacked. Kelmvor fell to the ground lifeless, just like the King. At that moment another dwarf rushed in and saw Kelmvor and the king dead, and Tagnor, with blood on his sword.<br>"Tagnor! I never thought you'd do such a thing" the dwarf exclaimed. "Since I'm the kings only heir now that he's dead I'm in charge," the dwarf said, "And you Tagnor, are to leave and never return, for you are from now on banished."<br>"Fine, if ye're so ready to accept I did this then I'm not so sure I want to be staying here under you're rule," stated Tagnor.<br><br>"And that is my tale' said the older dwarf<br>"So you're Tagnor then?" asked an adveturer.<br>"Aye" answered Tagnor.<br>"Where did you go after that," asked another adventurer.<br>"I wandered around the land, looking for others who might need a little extra defense," answered Tagnor. "Now if you don't mind I'm going to leave, I have some things to take care of" said Tagnor. Tagnor left the tavern that day, but when adventurers returned the days after that the dwarf was nowhere to be found.<br><br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br><br><br>	This is my first post here so I thought I'd make it my favorite class a Dwarven Defender and have a story to go with it.Im really proud of this build because it has a DR of 27 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  along with an AB of 42 and 4 attacks per round which may not seem that impressive but with some items that will add up to a +12 in Str and +7 weapon(I say +7 because its the cap on the server I play on) you should be able to get his ab somewhere around 55ab with 4 attacks per round I think.If you have any comments or suggestions to improve this build I'd really like to hear them.<br><br> <br>Playable from lvl 1-40<br><br>Race Dwarf<br>Alignment Any Lawful<br><br>Starting<br>Str 16<br>Dex 13<br>Con 18<br>Wis 8<br>Int 13<br>Cha 6<br><br>Leveling<br>1 Fighter1 Exotic Weapon Prof., Weapon Focus Bastard Sword<br>2 Fighter2 toughness<br>3 Fighter3 dodge<br>4 Fighter4 Str+1, Weapon Spec.

If you want to use a warhammer or battleaxe you can swap exotic weapon prof. for imporved initiative or something else and it won't affect the build. Gear for this char I would recommend gear that gives you the highest amount of ab+ on a weapon and ac+ on armor and shield. Also try to get gear with spell ressistance because mages will be your biggest threat and try to get gear that improves your con and str. Try to get gear with damage ressistance and immunities if possible to add to his tanking abilities.

It's a tough guy that can take quite some punishment. Punishment which he will receive. Make no mistakes about it, his AC is bad, nothing to increase his AC above minimum for a plate wearer, not even Tumble. You should shuffle pre-epic feats and leveling so you only have 6 fighter pre-epic. Take the 7th on an epic feat level to grab EWS. You have enough feats to pick from, I question the Overwhelming route, and would swap all those for other things, like EWS, perhaps greater Strength. Anything. Going warhammwer would even save a feat, like you state, to start WM earlier, so you can save 1 level fighter until epic. Power attack/Cleave/Great cleave/Overw crit? Drop it. It's only useful if you don't have anything better, or if you go for Dev Crit.<br><br>It's a masterful wall, but he can get better. Still okay, only 3 DR away from max, and for those 3 you get a lot.

I posted the same build a couple weeks ago...<br>7 26 7, but after suggestions it became a 6 26 8.<br>More ab on mine because of no power attack, cleave, great cleave and overwhelming crit.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225491", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Bearke on 02/08/06 16:48</span></i></p>

sorry, your build didn't come up on the search I did, didn't mean to post one you already had <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_redface.gif">  . This was the bad version of him though, if you want to see what mine eventually came out to be might want to check the true masterful wall build I did.
