<b>Playable from level 1-40... PvM or PvP build</b><br><br>With 1.66 having been released tonight, I think I'll post a couple of builds I've been saving.  With the "fix" to deathless mastery, the palemaster is now immune to sneak attacks.  Throw in the insane AC boost the PM gets (It should be getting that AC boost from the bone mail it creates, which means that it should not be able to wear armor and keep the AC bonus), the ability to cast epic spells without meeting the casting prerequisites and the immunity to paralyze, hold and stun and the PM has become a very powerful class.  This build is an update to my <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117491", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Skald of Shar</a> build, which was made when PMs were very broken. This build is a melee PM: it has a stellar AC, a good AB thanks to the Bard buffs and epic warding.  It is a very powerful melee build and it can cast as a level 16 bard with level 20 bard spell slots.  Pretty much this build's only weakness is other casters.  This build will probably perform best in a no-magic to mid-magic setting. <br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-Epic Warding. 800 points of 50/+20 damage reduction that lasts 16 rounds.<br>-6 levels of Bard Spells.  He has 4/5/5/5/4/4/4 spell castings and with 16 Bard levels a fairly high caster level.  He has a low DC on his spells though.<br>-56 Taunt Skill.  He has a very good chance of taunting an opponent and lowering his AC by upto 6 points.<br>-Level 16 Bard Song and Curse Song.  He can raise his AC by 5 points and his AB by 2 points and he can lower his opponents AC by 5 points and their AB by 2 points.  <br>-Immunity to Critical Hits.  Combine this with epic warding and you have an opponent that very few opponents could touch without powerful magic equipment.  He can cast energy buffer and he has 10 points of fire damage resistance, so darkfire and flame weapon won't be too effective against him.<br>-Devastating Critical.  With a (12-20 X2) critical threat range and a 39 DC this is pretty good. <br>-Use Magic Devices.  Granted, a low level, but he should still be able to use some equipment from other classes.<br>-Good AB.  A 40 unbuffed AB may seem a little low, but with bard song, war cry, GMW and Bull's Strength he can raise that to 51.  Throw in the ability to lower an opponents AC by upto 11 points and that's an effective AB of 62 without any magical equipment.  His maximum AB is 66 and his maximum effective AB is 77.  He should have no trouble hitting hitting his opponents in most settings. <br>-Excellent AC.  Thanks to the palemaster AC bonuses and the Bard's tumble skill he has really high AC.  Throw in the 50% concealment from improved invisibility and he is really hard to hit. <br>-Immune to hold, paralyze and stun.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br><br>-Low Saving Throws. He has pretty good saving throws vs. spells, but his base saving throws are low.<br>-No Spell Defence.  He can probably dispel a multiclassed mage, but a pure mage will wipe the floor with him.<br><br><b>Doom Skald</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Human<br><br><i>Alignment</i> TN, CN, NE or CE<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 16<br>DEX 8 <br>CON 12 <br>WIS 8 <br>INT 14<br>CHA 16<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>All 10 go to STR<br><br><i>Leveling Guide</i><br>Levels 1 Bard<br>Levels 2-5 Fighter<br>Level 6 Bard<br>Levels 7-10 Fighter<br>Levels 11-21 Bard<br>Levels 22-27 Palemaster<br>Level 28 Bard<br>Levels 29-33 Palemaster<br>Level 34 Bard <br>Levels 35-39 Palemaster<br>Level 40 Bard<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br><br>Bard 16<br>Fighter 8<br>Pale Master 16<br><br><i>Feats</i> <br>Level 1: Toughness, Curse Song<br>Level 2: Weapon Focus (Scimitar)<br>Level 3: Power Attack, Knockdown<br>Level 5: Cleave<br>Level 6: Blind-Fight<br>Level 8: Improved Knockdown<br>Level 9: Improved Critical (Scimitar)<br>Level 10: Great Cleave<br>Level 12: Lingering Song<br>Level 15: Still Spell<br>Level 18: Extend Spell<br>Level 21: Epic Weapon Focus (Scimitar)<br>Level 24: Epic Prowess<br>Level 27: Great Strength I<br>Level 30: Overwhelming Critical (Scimitar)<br>Level 33: Devastating Critical (Scimitar)<br>Level 36: Great Strength II, Energy Resistance (Fire)<br>Level 39: Epic Skill Focus (Taunt), Epic Spell (Epic Warding)<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 28<br>DEX 8<br>CON 12<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 16<br><br><i>Hit Points</i> (max every level) 415<br><br><i>Final Saves (Vs.

This is a build I'm going to try. I really like this kind of characters, both the mechanics of your build and the RPing possibilities.<br><br>You have chosen to take neither Epic Weapon Specialization nor Lasting Impression. <br>I see that with 8 fighter lvls EWS will cost you 1 BAB, ending at 16.

A fighter 4 build will also cost you 2 bonus feats.<br>I understand that AB is important for landing hits and Dev Crits. I wonder if that's why you have chosen not to take EWS and LI. <br><br>What are your thoughts on this?<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

I wanted 16 levels of bard and PM; Bard for the spells and full strength bard song, PM for the epic spell and 2 points of AC.  That left 8 levels of fighter, so getting EWS would result in a loss of AB.  When I compared the loss of AB and two feats, to 6 extra points of damage, I chose the former.  If this was a DEX build, I probably would have squeezed them in.  However, this build with a 28 STR, GMW, Bull's Strength, War Cry and Bard Song does 20-21 points of damage before the base damage is inflicted.  While it would still benefit from WS and EWS, it isn't in dire need of them.  If you want WS and EWS, I suggest you drop improved knockdown and either extend spell or blind-fight and shift two fighter levels to epic levels and two PM levels pre-epic.<br><br>I didn't take Lasting Inspiration for two reasons.  Firstly, I would need 20 uses of bard song per day, so I would have to drop lingering song for extra music and drop an epic feat for Lasting Inspiration.  Secondly, it just lasts too long.  With 16 bard songs or curse songs, it lasts long enough that I typically don't run out of songs between rests.  There also aren't too many battles that last for over 11 rounds, and after 11 rounds, it is usually time to cast improved invisibility, or use a scroll of GS, to take a breather to recast buffs and use healing material.  In those cases, remember that Bard Song heals damage and Curse Song inflicts damage.  It can be nice to poke an opponent again when you hit them again with curse song or heal some damage with a song.  If after 11 rounds you're still going strong, you probably don't need bard song or curse song to win anyway or you can use them in combat with no real loss.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 06/15/05 20:13</span></i></p>

If it's possible is it worth losing the 2 Great Strength feats, for Epic Mage Armor and Armor Skin?  You lose 1 AB and damage but gain even more defensively.

In a no magic setting it would probably be worth it.  If you have +5 equipment, your AC is high enough that probably only WMs and AAs can hit you regularly.  I tested against a max AB WM with +5 equipment which was immune to knockdown and critical hits and I got hit twice.  Really, I feel an extra 7 AC would be overkill when your AC is higher than most monks.  I personally feel that the AB is probably the weakest point of this build as it has no offensive spells to speak of and wizard spells can be expensive (those scrolls cost a lotta gold).<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 06/15/05 21:30</span></i></p>

Is it possible to rearrange the leveling order and replace Ftr with CoT? that would mean a boost to the saving throws at the sacrifice of weapon spec, but it could be worth it.

It isn't worth it.  You lose one feat and you can't focus in a martial weapon.  You also don't get the heavy armor proficiency.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 06/15/05 22:21</span></i></p>

Because I'm in a good mood...  I didn't bother to redo the skillpoint distribution and I decided to fit in EWS as, without devastating critical, the build needs a hard punch more than before.  Since the AC is pretty high, you could do away with the shield and use a two-handed weapon.<br><br><b>Doom Skald (Non devastating critical)</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Human<br><br><i>Alignment</i> TN, CN, NE or CE<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 16<br>DEX 8 <br>CON 12 <br>WIS 8 <br>INT 14<br>CHA 16<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>All 10 go to STR<br><br><i>Leveling Guide</i><br>Levels 1 Bard<br>Levels 2-5 Fighter<br>Level 6 Bard<br>Levels 7-8 Fighter<br>Levels 9-14 Bard<br>Level 15 Palemaster<br>Levels 16-19 Bard<br>Level 20 Palemaster<br>Level 21 Bard<br>Levels 22-23 Fighter<br>Levels 24-27 Palemaster<br>Level 28 Bard<br>Levels 29-33 Palemaster<br>Level 34 Bard <br>Levels 35-39 Palemaster<br>Level 40 Bard<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br><br>Bard 16<br>Fighter 8<br>Pale Master 16<br><br><i>Feats</i> <br>Level 1: Toughness, Curse Song<br>Level 2: Weapon Focus (Scimitar)<br>Level 3: Knockdown, Iron Will<br>Level 5: Weapon Specialization (Scimitar)<br>Level 6: Blind-Fight<br>Level 8: Improved Knockdown<br>Level 9: Improved Critical (Scimitar)<br>Level 12: Lingering Song<br>Level 15: Still Spell<br>Level 18: Extend Spell<br>Level 21: Epic Weapon Focus (Scimitar)<br>Level 23: Epic Weapon Specialization (Scimitar)<br>Level 24: Epic Prowess<br>Level 27: Great Strength I<br>Level 30: Great Strength II<br>Level 33: Great Strength III<br>Level 36: Great Strength IV, Energy Resistance (Fire)<br>Level 39: Epic Skill Focus (Taunt), Epic Spell (Epic Warding)<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 30<br>DEX 8<br>CON 12<br>WIS 8<br>INT 14<br>CHA 16<br><br><i>Hit Points</i> (max every level) 415<br><br><i>Final Saves (Vs.

Once again, Mith, hard to find fault in your builds.  Polished as usual.  I suspect that we'll see more builds like this to come.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Great job !!!!! I really like this build alot and looking forward to trying it. I think it would fit in good as a pirate type build for the new premium module coming out soon. Think of the Undead pirates in the curse of the black pool lol.<br><br><br>                    Thanks, Mano<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick.
