I'm working on a build at the moment that requires 4 alignment changes over its life. 1, maybe 2 changes could be justified I think, but is 4 pushing it a bit?<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

Methinks 2 is good and 4 is about the maximum I'd push it too so you're fine <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  as long as they're not to close that is.. cause it CAN get hard <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>-DaMouse

Thanks, thats good news <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>I can make a version of the build that ends up the same and only needs 1 alignment change but it would be less playable 1-40. When I've tested it I'll post both versions and people can make their own minds up.<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

Depends, on if they are good/evil or lawful/chaotic.  Lawful chaotic would be pushing it.  Good/evil isn't bad, as long as it's neutral&lt;-&gt;good or neutral&lt;-&gt;evil.  4 trips all the way from good&lt;-&gt;evil might be pushing it.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Thanks, it is NG&gt;N&gt;NG&gt;N&gt;NG but I'll see if I can get the build to work effectively with just N&gt;NG. Bit more playable at low levels with more changes but they aren't essential to the build.<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

I guess this is a palemaster build, but there aren't any character classes that require one to be good except paladin and the restrictions on CoT and HS are any non evil.  Please enlighten me if im mistaken.

^ You need to take the PRC into consideration, methinks.<br><br>Personally, a build is a build.<br><br>I don't fuss about "legit" questions.  If it is possible with the game mechanics, then so be it.<br><br>Whether or not I want to play a build, is another question.

Its a PRC build<br>However since the issue of alignment changes is a general 1 I decided to ask it here where answers are a little quicker <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>Why did Constantinople get the works? Thats nobodies business but the Turks!
