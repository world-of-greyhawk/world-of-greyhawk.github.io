I'm posting my build here, since I can't feel it's completely finished. I played this build on a server I used to frequent, but since my main computer is out I can't access it right now so it's recrated out of my memory and might even be room for improvements.<br><br>Server:<br>Mid- to highmagic. +5 items commonly availible, up to +7 for guild-leaders. Specialabilities and elemantal damage more frequent on +5 weapons. Same for amrmor.<br>DR belts availible.<br>Rings of elemental resistance.<br>STR-belts get up to +6 or +8 (Can't remember quite)<br>True Seeing helmets availible.<br>Immune to KD items availible, but it will cost AC. (I mean it's boots, loosing you dodge AC)<br><br>No Dev Crit<br>No scrolls containg past lvl5 spells availible too anyone 'cept the scriber.<br><br>A lot of the info above isn't really useful to you though.<br><br>Guilds are good or evil, except a merc-guild and the thieves guild.<br><br>My character is from a knight guild which is rp-heavy, and severely restricted. That made us lose a lot of PvP, without bothering us much. Our enemies consist of many Dex-based warriors though, making their AC's very high. Damage low, but still they won the game. I aimed for a super-AB in a melee build. Coupled with taunt and holy avenger dispels it did okay.<br><br>Restrictions for the Knights guild:<br>Human, with a few half-elves<br>Lawful Good only<br>Fighter<br>Cleric<br>CoT<br>Paladin<br>Ranger could be allowed on occasion<br><br>Equipment; Various weapon-types and shields. Armour availible only Chain and heavier.<br><br>Here we go:<br>Paladin(16), Fighter(2), Weapon Master(22), Human<br><br>STR: 16 (32)<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 13<br>CHA: 8<br><br>01: Paladin(1): Dodge, Weapon Focus: Longsword<br>02: Paladin(2): {Smite Evil}<br>03: Paladin(3): Mobility<br>04: Paladin(4): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>05: Paladin(5)<br>06: Paladin(6): Spring Attack<br>07: Paladin(7)<br>08: Paladin(8): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>09: Fighter(1): Expertise, Whirlwind Attack<br>10: Fighter(2): Blind Fight<br>11: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Longsword<br>12: Weapon Master(2): STR+1, Knockdown, (STR=19)<br>13: Weapon Master(3)<br>14: Weapon Master(4)<br>15: Weapon Master(5): Improved Critical: Longsword<br>16: Weapon Master(6): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>17: Weapon Master(7)<br>18: Paladin(9): Improved Knockdown<br>19: Paladin(10)<br>20: Paladin(11): STR+1, (STR=21)<br>21: Paladin(12): Great Strength I, (STR=22)<br>22: Paladin(13)<br>23: Paladin(14)<br>24: Paladin(15): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=24)<br>25: Weapon Master(8)<br>26: Weapon Master(9)<br>27: Weapon Master(10): Great Strength III, (STR=25)<br>28: Weapon Master(11): STR+1, (STR=26)<br>29: Weapon Master(12)<br>30: Weapon Master(13): Great Strength IV, Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword, (STR=27)<br>31: Weapon Master(14)<br>32: Weapon Master(15): STR+1, (STR=28)<br>33: Weapon Master(16): Great Strength V, Epic Prowess, (STR=29)<br>34: Weapon Master(17)<br>35: Weapon Master(18)<br>36: Weapon Master(19): STR+1, Great Strength VI, Armor Skin, (STR=31)<br>37: Weapon Master(20)<br>38: Weapon Master(21)<br>39: Weapon Master(22): Epic Skill Focus: Discipline, Epic Toughness I<br>40: Paladin(16): STR+1, (STR=32)<br><br><br>Hitpoints: 460<br>Saving Throws <br>Fort 23<br>Will 17<br>Ref: 19<br> <br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 50 (melee)<br>Aid+Bless+Prayer+Divine Favor+GMW=63 + Max STR =69.<br>In addition Prayer lower AC by 1, Taunt by max 6. Concentration is rarely a skill in non-casters. To top it, holysword or Holy Avengers dispel your enemies buffs and scroll-buffs.<br><br>I thought of no better way to get high AB with these restrictions.<br><br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 17/28<br><br>Spell Casting: Paladin(4)<br>3-3-1-1<br><br>Dmg: 1d8+11. (Prayer+DF)+6 magic, +6(Max STR) + 5 GMW = 1d8+28(15-20/x3)<br><br>There's a few tweaks I can think of right now. Starting 15 STR and 14 CON from start, dropping ESF for GrSTR. Ending with less Disc, but adding 40 hp. Dropping IKD for toughness, you can still KD the dexers mostly.<br><br><br>One option might be to drop 3 lvls of WM, loosing Epic-Toughness. Dropping ESF. Taking 2 more Fighter levels for EWS, upping damage by 6, or 18 crit. Killing fast is always good.<br><br>Spamming IKD's is the game, if they ain't immune. 1st time on their ***, Taunt. Spam more. If not able to KD, I jus Expertised, if unable to get through AC, until the dispel hit, then left expertise.<br><br>I seem to remember having a longsword +5 Holy avenger with 2d6 positive energy damage, and a longsword+7, keen which I used to cast holysword upon when needed. The armour I received after awhile had +20 disipline (which makes ESF useless, really) and a ring gave 1-1-1-1 slots to Paladin. Some CHA bonuses on the knights items too, which helped my abysmal saves.<br><br>Any help with the build folks? Lot of info to take in, but concentrate on the build and the info given about the knighthood.<br><br>Don't worry about PvM, this build does very well as a heavy meleer, no need to solo on this server either, lest you want to. Then I just focused on places my saves wouldn't end me so easy. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

I've worked all night, so after I get some rest I will try and be more helpful. <br><br>At first glance it looks like a really solid build for what you are trying to accomplish. Seeing a Paladin with a CHA score of 8 breaks my heart, I understand it is not needed though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  . Great AB. Will check back later...off to bed.<br><br>*EDIT* Well, just one thing before bedtime. I would consider the 4 levels of fighter for WS/EWS that you mentioned. You could then add another Paladin level for a skill dump to Taunt in between all those WM levels. 17 Paladin/4 Fighter/19 WM. Would lose 1 AB and the Epic Toughness.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By galelabriel on 04/10/08 12:03</span></i></p>

I'd consider going Paladin 19/WM 19, you lose -1 AB and Epi cToughness but get back more spellslots and slightly longer buffs duration.<br><br>BTW, is this for Dragonlance AoH? Is it still up?<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die
