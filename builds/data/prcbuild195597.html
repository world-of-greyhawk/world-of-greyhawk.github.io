The Singing Dragon (Bard 20/RDD 10/Initiate of Draconic Mysteries 10)<br><br>When my first ever character (a halforc Barbarian/Bard/RDD)  got the Great Wyrm Gauntlets and discovered they were entirely useless to her I was quite annoyed. This build was designed to achieve 2 things :<br>1)Allow a Bard/RDD to melee unarmed effectively without taking Monk levels.<br>2)Allow a RDD to actually become a Dragon, something I always thought would be fun.<br><br>Race: Orog<br>Alignment: Any non-Lawful<br><br>Abilities: Initial/Final<br>STR 20/38; DEX 12; CON 14/16; INT 14/16; WIS  06; CHA 16/18<br>All Ability increases go into STR<br><br>Level Progression<br>1: Bard - Power Attack; 4 in Conc, Disc, Jump, Lore, &amp; Tumble, 3 in UMD, 1 in Perform<br>2: Bard - 2 in Perform, 1 in Conc, Jump, Lore, &amp; Tumble<br>3: Bard - Cleave; 3 in Perform, 1 in Conc, Jump, &amp; Lore <br>4: Bard - 2 in Disc &amp; Tumble, 1 in Jump &amp; Lore<br>5: Bard - 2 in Disc, 1 in Jump, Lore, Tumble &amp; UMD<br>6: RDD - Alertness; 3 in SC, 1 in Disc<br>7: RDD - 3 in SC, 1 in Disc<br>8: RDD - 3 in SC, 1 in Disc<br>9: RDD - Improved Unarmed Strike; 3 in SC, 1 in Disc<br>10: IoDM - 5 in Tumble, 1 saved<br>11: IoDM - 1 in Tumble, 6 saved<br>12: IoDM - Great Cleave; 1 in Tumble, 11 saved<br>13: IoDM - 1 in Tumble, 16 saved<br>14: IoDM - 1 in Tumble, 21 saved<br>15: IoDM - Improved Critical (Unarmed Strike); 1 in Tumble, 26 saved<br>16: Bard -  14 in UMD, 7 in Disc &amp; SC, 3 in Perform, 1 in Tumble, 0 saved<br>17: IoDM - 1 in Tumble, 3 spare, 2 saved<br>18: Bard - Weapon Focus (Unarmed Strike); 3 in UMD, 2 in Disc &amp; SC, 1 in Tumble, 0 saved<br>19: IoDM - 1 in Tumble,  1 spare, 4 saved<br>20: Bard -  3 in Perform, 2 in Disc, SC &amp; UMD, 1 in Tumble, 0 saved<br>21: IoDM - Overwhelming Critical (Unarmed Strike);  1 in Tumble, 5 spare, 0 saved<br>22: IoDM - 1 in Tumble, 3 spare, 2 saved<br>23: RDD - 3 in Disc &amp; SC, 0 saved<br>24: RDD - Devastating Critical (Unarmed Strike); 1 in Disc &amp; SC, 2 saved<br>25: RDD - 1 in Disc &amp; SC, 4 saved<br>26: RDD -  1 in Disc &amp; SC, 6 saved<br>27: RDD - Armour Skin; 1 in Disc &amp; SC, 8 saved<br>28: RDD - 1 in Disc &amp; SC, 11 saved<br>29: Bard - 9 in UMD, 7 in Tumble, 1 in Disc &amp; SC, 0 saved<br>30: Bard - Curse Song; 1 in Disc, SC, Tumble, &amp; UMD, 3 spare, 0 saved<br>31: Bard - 2 in Perform, 1 in Disc, SC, Tumble  &amp; UMD, 1 spare, 0 saved<br>32: Bard - 1 in Disc, SC, Tumble &amp; UMD, 3 spare, 0 saved<br>33: Bard - Epic Prowess; 1 in Disc, SC, Tumble &amp; UMD, 3 saved<br>34: Bard - 3 in Perform, 1 in Disc, SC, Tumble &amp; UMD, 3 saved<br>35: Bard - 3 in Perform, 1 in Disc, SC, Tumble &amp; UMD, 3 saved<br>36: Bard - Epic Weapon Focus (Unarmed Strike); 6 in Perform, 1 in Disc, SC, Tumble &amp; UMD, 0 saved<br>37: Bard - 1 in Disc, SC, Tumble &amp; UMD, 3 spare, 0 saved<br>38: Bard - 1 in Disc, SC &amp; UMD, 4 spare, 0 saved<br>39: Bard - Toughness; 1 in Disc &amp; SC; 5 spare, 0 saved<br>40: Bard - 1 in Disc, 6 spare<br><br>Final Skills : Conc 6, Disc 43, Jump 8, Lore 8, Perform 26, SC 42, Tumble 40, UMD 41, 37 spare<br><br>Final Stats (Unbuffed): <br>BAB: 25<br>AC (No Armour): 27<br>AB (Unarmed): +43/+38/+33<br>Damage (Unarmed): 1-6+14 (Crit 19-20/x2)<br>Fortitude: +25<br>Reflex: +24<br>Will: +24<br>SR: 25<br>HP: 464<br><br>Spells<br>1: Balagarn’s Iron Horn, Grease, Identify, Mage Armour, Protection From Alignment<br>2: Bull’s Strength, Cat’s Grace, Darkness, See Invisibility, Ultravision<br>3: Dispel Magic, Greater Magic Weapon, Haste, Keen Edge, Legion’s Curse of Impending Blades<br>4: Cure Critical Wounds, Dismissal, Hold Monster, Improved Invisibility, War Cry<br>5: Ethereal Visage, Greater Dispelling, Greater Heroism, Mind Fog, Wall of Greater Dispel Magic<br>6: Dirge, Energy Buffer, Ice Storm, Summon Creature VI<br><br>The spell list is based on her going solo and having no magic items.<br>Due to her low Spell DC I found buffs and those few spells that have no saves (like Legion’s Curse of Impending Blades and Ice Storm) most useful.<br><br>Magic Item Wishlist: Robes of the Dark Moon (or Drow Spellchain and Boots of Haste), Great Wyrm Gauntlets or a good pair of Monk gloves, a big nasty 2-hander for fighting Crit Immune and/or high DR creatures, and a STR enhancing item to make those criticals she does manage to land count.<br><br>Pros<br>Dragon form at level 22<br>Devastating Critical at level 24<br>Good saves with the +9 from Spellcraft<br>Improved Evasion and Fire Immunity<br>With all her buffing spells up and level 16 Bard and Curse Song going she is quite impressive.<br> <br>Cons<br>Only 3 attacks/round<br>Doesn’t critical  very often<br>SR is helpful when she gets it but by level 40 is pretty useless<br>Vulnerable to having her buffs dispelled<br><br>Variations<br>Toughness is a pretty optional feat. I also considered Blind Fighting, Extend Spell and Lingering Song.<br>A human version can be made. Losing +6 STR hurts but the extra feat and skills help. If the human took 8 levels of RDD pre-epic and the last 2 at level 21-22 it could take the same feats at the same levels but wouldn’t get Dragon form until level 28.<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.
