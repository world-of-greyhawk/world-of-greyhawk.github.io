I see 2 main problems - <br>1 - if you go with unarmed, you should really take 6 more monk levels to get the max unarmed damage. So I would take Kama over unarmed with this level split, which also frees up the glove slot.<br>2 - Low AB. I would drop ESF: Disc and Epic Reflexes for more Gr. Str. I'd also drop 4 monk levels for 4 Fighter levels (end at Monk 6), go with kamas, and move EWF adn EWS to fighter bonus feats to get 2 more Gr Str. Gains 2 more AB to reach 40, and 2 damage.<br><br>TM

I took heavy flail because I wanted a blunt weapon and I wanted a twohander since the monk cant use shields anyway.

No IDK this way however. I guess I could make it monk6/fighter8/dd26 instead and drop one epic feat.

Fighter gives you automatically Shield Proficiency, so you can use them, not that it is of any practical use, Dwarven Defenders don't need AC.

What I meant was that if I use a shield I lose the monk bonuses so I would get the same ac without a shield as with a shield and therefore I might aswell use a twohander. But ofcourse it may be better to use a kama instead. I looks cooler with a twohander to me though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Note that if you use a shield, you also lose the monk attack progression with a kama.<br><br>If you plan to use a shield or a non-kama weapon, I would drop monk completely and take Rogue instead. You gain some sneak damage, keep the tumble dumps, and add other skills like UMD, set/disable traps, etc. Ro 10/F 4/DD 26 would work well, although you could take as few as 2 Rogue levels for more Fighter bonus feats.<br><br>TM

Monk does give you Cleave and IKD, so it's not completely worthless to take monk, but taking monk without using its APR progression + Flurry doesn't fit in my brain.
