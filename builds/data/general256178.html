I was looking at buffing cleric builds, aimed especially at high SR so I could cast Spell Resistence onto a sequencer robe.  I started noticing reference to caps on SR, in particular people remarking that there is no point in a cleric going above level 28 as far as SR is concerned.<br><br>Then I started noticing more references to caps that I hadn't been aware of, such as a cap on AB?<br><br>Is there a good place where these things are documented, and would someone be willing to point me to it?<br><br>Thanks.

What? There's no cap on SR. Note however, that if you cast a spell through a sequencer, it will be cast at a lower level than you are (most likelY). Unless the sequencer scripts have been modified to use your caster level, of course.<br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a>

Mmm...something else I hadn't known.  Thanks.  Is there a simple way to determine at what level the spell will be cast?<br><br>So then, for buffing purposes--particularly for storing spells in a sequencer robe, there is limit to the number of cleric levels it is worthwhile to have.<br><br>I wonder how I misinterpreted those posts.  What about Attack Bonus?  Mmm...I should probably go find those posts again and either figure out what they meant, or copy them here if I can't.

Yeah, okay...I got it from this quote:<br><br>"Since a monk is the only thing that can have an SR over 32, and an SR monk will probably be built to have more SR than can be penetrated at all, there's not alot of benefit to trying to penetrate more than 32 SR in most cases."<br><br>Which I found here: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "219971", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>I don't remember where I saw the reference to there being a cap on AB; maybe I imagined it.

That's about SP actually, not SR.<br><br>Anyhow, the highest the SR the better but only vs non mages. Mages will breach your SR in no time so against them it's worthless.<br><br>The AB cap is +20. Your sheet will not show this cap but check the combat logs and you'll see the difference between reality and illusion (delusion?). You can get a further +6 by capping your AB stat (STR or DEX or WIS for Zen archers).<br><br>AB enhancement not counting towards the cap:<br>-Size modifiers<br>-BoE<br>-Druid Nature Sense<br>-Smite Evil/Good<br>-Halfling Good Aim<br>-Flanking Bonus<br>-Bonus to hit prone targets<br>-Weapon size modifier during a Disarm Attempt<br><br>Furthemore you can effectively increase your AB by decreasing you target's AC via Curse Song, Taunt, causing flatfootedness, etc.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!

So, then, if I'm on a high magic PW where +12 items are easily found, then any direct buffs (bard song, divine power, &amp;c) to AB beyond +8 are a waste.  Or, alteranately, if I have more than +8 in direct buffs, using a +12 AB weapon is a waste.  If I've stated that accurately, then I understand.<br><br>My thanks for taking the time to answer.

Yes if you can get a +12 weapon, buffing beyond +8 with direct AB buffs is useless.<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!
