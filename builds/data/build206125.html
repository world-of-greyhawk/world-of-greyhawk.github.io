<b>Playable from level 1 - 40  .PvM</b><br><br>I haven't seen too many applicants for the Dwarven Assassin Guild lately, so I put together an idea that was kicking around in my head: an ugly, speedy, dex-based ginsu machine that could knockdown the opponent for wicked sneak attacks (13d6 Death Attack + 3d6 Sneak Attack). Since I went Dex-Based I elected to build in some Fighter levels to get Epic Weapon Spec (assuming the damage bonus applies to every hit done with Flurry of Blows).<br><br>(Baby Kaliban was up at 4:30 this morning so fatigue is winning out over creativity - sorry there is no entertaining intro.

Just a note.  It's been shown that Improved Sneak Attack is currently bugged, such that it won't work for an assassin without any real "sneak attack" feat, like from rogue levels.  This is something that will hopefully be fixed in 1.67, but just wanted to let you know.<br><br>Steve

You know, in light of the Improved Sneak bug, have you considered taking SC feats in its place?  With minimal shifting, you can take Ftr 5 in pre-epic, then fighter 6 at lvl 21 to gain EWF/EWS, and then focus on Great Dex.  At level 32, you can have a 30 Dex, and then use bonus feats 18 and 22 and General 33/36/39 for your SC feats.  You lose Armor Skin and Epic Prowess, but you can drop one of your late Assassin levels for a Monk level 10, still top out discipline, and increase your AC +1 from Monk level 10.  You lose 1d6 sneak dice in the trade.  The other way you could do it is to stop at Lvl 23Assn, take 2 more Fighters so that you can still keep Armor Skin or Epic Prowess(you decide) but have SC V on top of it, as well as a capped out Discipline.<br><br>The counter arguement is, he gets Improved Invis already, and has UMD to cast from scrolls.  He also loses 1AB because Epic Prowess is gone, he loses 1 net AC, and 1d6 Death.  My thought is that 50% Concealment is always sweeter when it is permanent and non-dispellable and one less thing you have to activate, or look for, or have to rest to regain.<br><br>Good build.  As usual, the lack of skill points is lamentable due to the shafting Assassins get, but that's unavoidable.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Furthermore, if I may, I'd say he is a welcome addition to the Guild Halls of Dwarf Assassins.  I think we'll even waive his entry fee and probationary status.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I haven't had a chance to get back to my Building Mod to see what I could choose in place of Imp. Sponge Attack. I wanted to post a 'bug-proof' version, and was thinking perhaps more Great Dex, but wasn't sure if it would be available, or the best choice.<br><br>However, I must say you bring up an enticing avenue to take. I'll definitely take a whack at an SC V version of my Dwarven Mafia. I, too, see the benefit of full-time, non-dispellable concealment. Methinks it might even be worthy of a new build title. Hmmm. I'm thinking  'Something-Shifty'.....I'll mull it over while hoisting me Guinness this evening!<br><br>And we'll be seeing you in the Guild Hall!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"><br>_________________<br><i>"Where there is life, there is hope." - Grover</i>
