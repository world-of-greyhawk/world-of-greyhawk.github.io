Not one of your more inspired efforts, but a solid Cleric nevertheless.  Regarding PvM, you'll want to note an XP penalty is incurred once you get going hot and heavy with Monk.  This could easily be avoided by going Blackguard instead of Paladin, which you qualify for automatically.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Betty, this was never built to focus on spell DCs, rather it was made for monk speed/high ac and saves with decent DCs.<br><br>Basically it was made for survivability in a PvP or a difficult PvM environment.

I tend to prefer Maximize over Empower though if you wanted you could switch Great Fortitude out for Empower.<br><br>As for Extend..you have more then enough spell slots to handle being without it, although again you can switch Great Fortitude out for it if you really wanted.

8 Empower Blade Barriers will kill any low-reflex type, guaranteed and you still keep your 9th level spell slots for Implosion.<br><br>Bonus points, however, if they get hit 2-3 times by the same barrier.  Happens more than you think, btw.  There's a lot of running around in combat.

Just empound yourself in a cage of blade barriers, anyone who comes picking a fight has to cross them <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>-DaMouse

LOL!  If that is your strategy, dont do the cage.  Do the strat i mention in my cleric guide.  Again, more save rolls = more chances to miss = more damage!

I suppose since everyone's talking about BB right now, it'ld be interesting to point out that this build is nearly immune to its own blade barriers as SR will block almost all of them and if nothing else you also have imp evasion and a reasonable reflex save (37 with +12 dex/cha and +4 from Spellcraft vs DC 39 BB if I remember correctly)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Revenant Mattlov on 04/12/09 05:28</span></i></p>
