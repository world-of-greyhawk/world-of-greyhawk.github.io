Hey everyone. I just got a computer capable of running NWN again, and upon my return to my old server, I want a fresh character, and I was hoping for some help.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>World Specifics:<br><br>-Devastating Critical is dissallowed<br>-Shadowdancer is dissallowed<br>-RDD requires 12 levels of Sorcerer or Bard<br>-Do not count on Weapons or Armour beyond +3<br>-No spells of great consequence have been changed<br>-Weapon Buffs cannot stack (no GMW and Keen on a weapon)<br>-No Perma-Haste or True Sight on items<br>-No damage immunities or KD immunity through items<br>-Minimum of 3 levels per class taken (No 1-Monk-Cheese)<br>-Once you take 1 level in any class, you must take 3 before switching (no lvl 1 cleric; lvl 1 rogue; lvl 2 cleric etc) Once you have 3 levels in a class anything goes.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>This said, I really want to try a Monk. Never have, but they always seemed so cool. The abilities, the RP, the speed... Oh yes, the speed... I like it all! Thing is, it seems impossible to me! Splitting stats into just about each catagory aside from Charisma is too much for me to manage efficiently, and yet it all seems necissary. So I come here with these concerns and a hope that you guys can give me a hand.<br><br>I want a build that is primarily a Monk, though of course can Multiclass. I prefer it to be unarmed, as Stunning Fist is one of my favourite Monk abilities. I would take Dexterity over Strength because I want Epic Dodge and to be a Stealth Monk. I was thinking that Rogue would be a good combination, because once stunned, Sneak Attacks apply, right? I would take Assasin but I don't want to play Evil, and I don't want to pump into Intelligence for the DC; plus, it takes too many Assasin levels to be useful... the only advantage to that is Improved Invisibility and Darkness.<br><br>I don't know how hard it is to get, but I hear that 50% concealment is possible. That coupled with Epic Dodge, Stealth, and some decent AC... that sounds like something that could drag a fight on forever. Is it possible to manage?<br><br>Ugh... I don't know any of this. So I'm just gonna summarize that I want:<br><br>-Stealth<br>-Unarmed <br>-Dex Based<br>-Stunning Fist<br>-Epic Dodge<br>-Highest AB/AC possible, obviously<br>-Sneak Attack<br><br>Yup. How do I manage this? Whats a good level split? What are good feats to take? Stat split?

I would suggest something along these lines:<br><br>Monk(16), Rogue(14), Elf<br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 18 (29)<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 272<br>Skillpoints: 254<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 16/17/27<br>BAB: 20<br>AB (max, naked): 32 (melee), 29 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 31/31<br><br>Hide 33(42), Move Silently 33(42), Tumble 30(39), UMD 31(30), 127 left over for your choice of Rogue skills (I recommend Disarm and Set Traps, with some in Search or Listen). <br><br>01: Monk(1): Dodge, M: (Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist)<br>02: Monk(2): M: (Deflect Arrows)<br>03: Monk(3): Weapon Finesse<br>04: Rogue(1): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br>05: Rogue(2)<br>06: Rogue(3): Weapon Focus: Unarmed, Ro: (Uncanny Dodge I)<br>07: Rogue(4)<br>08: Monk(4): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>09: Monk(5): Blind Fight<br>10: Rogue(5)<br>11: Rogue(6)<br>12: Monk(6): DEX+1, Toughness, M: (Knockdown, Improved Knockdown), (DEX=21)<br>13: Monk(7)<br>14: Rogue(7)<br>15: Rogue(8): Expertise<br>16: Monk(8): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>17: Monk(9): M: (Improved Evasion)<br>18: Monk(10): Improved Expertise<br>19: Monk(11)<br>20: Monk(12): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br>21: Rogue(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br>22: Rogue(10): Defensive Roll<br>23: Rogue(11)<br>24: Rogue(12): DEX+1, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=25)<br>25: Rogue(13): Epic Dodge<br>26: Monk(13)<br>27: Monk(14): Epic Prowess<br>28: Rogue(14): DEX+1, (DEX=26)<br>29: Monk(15)<br>30: Monk(16): Armor Skin<br><br><br>Some notes: I tried to minimize XP penalties, but you do have 20% for 6 of the levels. Halfling would avoid them, but then you use the lower unarmed damage table. Also, you get your maximum unarmed damage very late in the build. <br><br>If you went with kama instead of unarmed, I would use Halfling, and go with Monk 6/Fighter 5/Rogue 19. You can pick up WS/EWS that way, get better BAB and an extra attack per round, and get Crippling Strike. You could do that unarmed as well, but your base damage will be very low (1d6).<br><br>TM

Thanks!<br><br>As soon as I get some time to actually sit down for more than 5 minutes, I'll get on NWN and test it out. I'll come back if I have any questions.<br><br>Thanks again.

Semi-off topic but I had a quick question (And hopefully it will be useful info for Okembour as well)<br><br>Does Ambidexterity and Two weapon fighting have any effect if you are fighting unarmed?  I know using Kamas it will help; but is unarmed uneffected by the penalties?<br>_________________<br><i>-4SakN</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "14359", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Moonshae Isles - Forgotten Realms</a><br>A Role Play, Low Magic world

TWF and ITWF add neither extra attacks nor penalties when you are fighting unarmed. So I wouldn't bother taking the feats unless you plan to focus on using kamas.<br><br>TM
