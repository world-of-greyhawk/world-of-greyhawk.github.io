<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 PvM or PvP</b><br><br>This is a build I have always enjoyed on my PW.

Interesting, a very different kind of build - it looks really good.<br><br>I would 'tweak' the initial stats even more.<br><br>STR 8 <br>DEX 14<br>CON 10<br>INT 14<br>WIS 18<br>CHA 8<br><br>STR is really not important since the char. is not wearing heavy armor or a heavy melee weapon. At level 40 I guess a couple of bags of holding should be available anyway.<br><br>Another thought - maybe you should put some points in Discipline - I know that it's rather annoying to be knocked down especially when you rely on casting and you have a low'ish number of hitpoints.<br><br>EDIT: <br><br>Because the WIS is so high the DC the opponent has to save against is really high - if the spell foucs feats could be put in somehow it would be very hard for anyone to save against offensive spells.<br><br>I think I might playtest this build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By MartinJHolm on 09/17/04 09:49</span></i></p>

I seen this build in action on the PW story Athas Reborn. She tanks 10 beast of the harder variety there without taking any more than 20 damage on a given spawn. Very nasty build. Always wanted to ask her: why elf and not human or halfling to avoid the XP penalty/ snag extra skill points? As a novice, I never see the reasoning behind any given build until it's explained to me. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif"> <br>Is it the always active serch mode and the free bow/blade feat? Much appreciated and glad to finally get my hands on this template.

Yes elf is for active search and free bow prof<br><br>Also dex is a cheap to raise to 16 for even more ac goodness<br><br>I prefer the starting 16 wisdom because that 6 ability score points I can distribute elsewhere and it would only add 1 ab ac and dc... at the cost of 40 hp, 1 fort save bonus, low str, and lower dex which is costing me an ac point so it cancels out the ac gain from the higher wisdom.<br><br>This build doesnt need spellfocus for what its designed to do but it can be reworked if higher spell DCs are what you prefer. <br><br>Discipline isnt needed since you concentrate more on not getting hit at all than avoiding things like knockdown. That ac is only what it could be without any magical gear. if you can manage to get gear to max out your wisdom and dex bonuses your ac is substantially higher add things like spell scrolls of mage armor and shield and you can boost your ac even further. Any kind of boots with a dodge bonus is even more ac. And a haste potion or item is icing on the cake.<br><br>To combat stealthers Phae can use scrolls like clairvoyance and amplify to further boost her considerable spot and listen skills. Any gear that you add on top of it with spot and listen bonuses makes hiding from her virtually impossible and since most stealthers lack a good fort or will save you can usually catch them with a well placed Implosion or destruction spell.<br>_________________<br>Vajra: Just how many men are you involved with Kyri?<br>Kyriani: That Depends Vajra, do you mean men as in males? or just humans? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kyriani Agrivar on 09/18/04 23:31</span></i></p>

As a modification to this build one can have starting strength and con of 8 to max out the wisdom at lvl 1 and drop the epic skill focus feats to take the final two great wisdom feats for max ac and ab and spell DC<br><br>you'll need much con gear to mitigate the poor hp and fort save but overall its probably veyr powerful in the single player campaigns.<br><br>if you arent looking to deal with SDs you can use the above modification to stats with a Human and have a 10 con instead of 8 as well as no xp penalty. but your starting dex will only be 14 then and you wont have active search. The build is modifiable in a number of ways depending on your playstyle and environment.<br>_________________<br>Vajra: Just how many men are you involved with Kyri?<br>Kyriani: That Depends Vajra, do you mean men as in males? or just humans? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Just a point I wanted to make. Why focus on both Spot AND Listen? You really only need one or the other to spot SDs and Corner-Sneakers. And that would open up a ton more skill points to be distributed elsewhere.<br><br>Personally, I usually take only listen, and take Epic Skill Focus Listen, since many of the servers I play on have items that give +10 more Hide than Move Silent, so you can catch people much easier with that route.<br><br>Just a suggestion.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By PrionViver on 02/13/08 20:07</span></i></p>

This is a nice build, and the cleric/monk/rogue combo is usually a pretty solid one.  If you could live without getting Use Magic Device from Rogue, a 35 Cleric 3 Monk 2 Shadowdancer is also a nice combo.  You still get uncanny dodge, but you trade UMD for Hips.  The combination of Hips/Harm works really well for that build too.  32 6 2 of the same class split work nicely as well, with the extra monk speed and all.  Either way, nice job.

It's great to see people still discussing this build so long after Kyri made it. The server that spawned this template is still operating and is better than ever, with even more of the kind of content that made it necessary in the first place.
