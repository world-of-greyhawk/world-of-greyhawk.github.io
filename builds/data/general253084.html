The Roleplay is medium, as is the PVM challenge. PVP is lite, &amp; magic items have just been revamped to become less plentiful, and cap at +5.<br><br>Characters - Zephyroth

I play much less on-line than I used to (have some SP mods I'm playing, and I have much less time). That being said, World of Greyhawk is where I choose to spend any on-line hours.<br><br>It's an action server, but roleplay is certanly not discouraged, and it's appreciated (Clerics and Pally's must choose a deity and Clerics must choose from specific domains that correspond to their deity choice). The encounters are quite challenging, the server uses modified HCR (you need food to rest, there's a bleeding script, etc), but the respawn penalties are not harsh. Magic level is low: other than an extremely powerful artifact that's part of the overall module story arc, there's nothing above +5 that I'm aware, and those are quite rare.<br><br>First character I played there was a Bard/FTR/RDD named M'alys Chant (she made it to level 27 or 28).<br><br>The character I currently play is a Dwarf FTR/Rogue/WIZ by the name of Kallust Knuckle (level 20). I've also a lower level Human RGR/FTR/Assn that I play as well.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Hey folks... I'm trying to rekindle my interest in NWN, but haven't found that many new single player modules which are 1 - good and 2 - go far into the epic levels to challenge my builds.  <br><br>I'm thinking I might have some better luck with a PW - any suggestions?  I'd prefer a world that went to level 40, with fun and meaningful epic content for both parties and soloists, and where you don't have to be a battle cleric or a dragon build to solo.  <br><br>I don't care about subraces or add-on spells and classes, but I do want to be able to play all the HOTU classes with few or no restrictions on builds.  And the fewer changes that have been made in the name of "balance" the better - that never actually creates balance, it just changes the imbalances.<br><br>Feel free to PM me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
