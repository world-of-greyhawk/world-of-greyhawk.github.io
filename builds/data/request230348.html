I need a build for a slow leveling server.. .Well 1-15 is fairly easy, but from there on it gets bloody hard..<br><br>So i need a shifter build that will be fairly good after 15.. It's a really low magic server, where clerics dominate all..<br><br>Any Rak/Dragon/other good builds are welcome, but it also need to be low-level power.. <br><br>It might be a hard one to crack, but please give it your best shot.<br><br>Oh.. And no Elf race allowed.

Tough encounters or slow levelling because of low xp returns? Tell us more about the challenges, and it will be easier to give advice.<br><br>Shifters usually do all right on low magic servers because of the innate abilities of the different forms. If it is hard to get past lvl 15, maybe the build should focus more on playability from that lvl on than on how a fully developed lvl 40 character looks.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

Mhm.. Not really hard encounters.. Just low XP since it's a fairly new server, and not many highlevel areas has been build yet...
