I go elf.  You have an experience penalty if you do not go human.<br><br>Equipment<br>Full Plate<br>Greatsword<br>Trap Kits <br><br>AVENGING COMMANDO ADVANTAGES<br><br>•	High Use Magic Device.  Like MacGuyver or any good marine, the Avenging Commando can improvise, adapt, and overcome.  This gives huge versatility to the character, particularly if uses his rogue abilities to scout out a situation.<br>•	Devastating Critical. As a warrior against the forces of evil, the Avenging Commando has become a master swordsman, capable of killing an opponent with one blow. <br>•	Can use the best armor in the game without concern for spell failure (only casts from items and scrolls) or class/alignment restriction (use magic device).  <br>•	10D6 Sneak Attack. Evil must fall, and swiftly.  Augments his already potent critical attack with sneak attacks for distracted or unsuspecting opponents.  <br>•	Level 4 Paladin Spells.  Including Holy Avenger, Greater Magic Weapon, Bull Strength, Prayer, Protection from Evil.<br>•	Can set and craft traps. <br>•	Decent saves.  Divine Grace adds the charisma bonus to all saves.  +4 to saves against spells due to spellcraft.<br>•	Improved Evasion.  The Avenging Commando will either take half damage or no damage against damage spells.<br>•	Immune to fear and disease. <br>•	Smite evil three times a day<br>•	Cure disease.<br>•	Lay on hands.<br>•	Turn and destroy undead.<br>•	Decent AB for a character with rogue abilities: BAB OF 29, 37 after strength bonus applied, with four attacks per round.  Using greatsword, this jumps to 46.<br><br>AVENGING COMMANDO DISADVANTAGES<br><br>•	Low Hitpoints.  Very low for a melee character.  Need boots of striding.  <br><br>FAVORED SPELLS:<br><br>•	Level 1: Bless, Protection From Alignment, Sanctuary, <br>•	Level 2: Bull's Strength, Endurance <br>•	Level 3: Greater Magic Weapon <br>•	Level 4: Holy Avenger <br><br>MAGIC ITEM WISH LIST:<br><br>•	An item with haste or scrolls of haste. <br>•	A powerful greatsword, preferably keen. With greater magic weapon and holy avenger, he can turn a normal greatsword into a powerful weapon, but some extra power is always useful. <br>•	HP boosting items. To address his low HP.  <br><br>Key Stats<br><br>Final Saves (Vs. Spells)<br>•	Fortitude 27 (31) <br>•	Reflexes 23 (27) <br>•	Will 22 (26) <br>AB and Damage<br>•	With no buffs, regular greatsword:<br>40/35/30/25 18+2D6 (+10D6 Sneak Attack) (17-20 x2)<br>Devastating Critical DC 38 <br>•	Holy Avenger, Greater Magic Weapon, Bull's Strength.
