Quote: Posted 02/13/04 23:01:19 (GMT) by Necromasterx<br><br>    What about a Samurai build?<br>    Im prolly gonna get weaponmaster, and fighter, but for a third class I am not sure... Just maxing fighter and weaponmaster would not be a very interesting or samurai-esque char. Maybe get some barbarian levels, or monk levels would really be nice. Please help me create the ultimate Samurai. I want you guys to help me make 3 kinds of Samurai, a Katana based Warrior, a Longbow based Archer, and maybe a Caster (I know samurai arent mages, but maybe ranger or something) and race should prolly be elf. And the archer would prolly need AA levels as much as the Warrior would need WM levels.<br><br><br>Well, I always liked the idea of making a samurai, so here's the ARCHER version of it.<br><br>Concept: Wise (high Wisdom) and trustworthy (good) elven warrior, who follows the ancient laws of the martial arts (lawful, monk), and, after years of study, (wizard) has learned to channel his Ki into the very arrows he shoots (arcane archer), while mastering the art of hand-to-hand fighting.<br><br>Elf - Lawful Good (you MAY take human, but the bonus feat would just go to Martial Weapon Profiency)<br>10 Monk/1 Wizard/29 Arcane Archer<br><br>Name: Ki Archer Samurai<br><br>STR 10<br>DEX 16 +2<br>CON 12<br>INT 12<br>WIS 16 + 10 +6<br>CHA 10<br><br>Level progression: 1 monk, 1 Wizard, 5-7 Monk, 10 AA, 1-3 Monk, 19 AA, 1 Monk<br><br>The pre-epic Monk levels (9) may be taken in any order with AA levels after you get 6 BAB to lvl up as AA.<br><br>Only "must have" feats are: Alertness, WF: Longbow &amp; Point Blank Shot, Zen Archery, 2x Great Dex (AABF) and 6x Great Wisdom. EWF: Longbow (AABF),<br><br>Useful feats (in no particular order): Armor Skin, Rapid Shot<br><br>HP: 308 (no rerolls)<br><br>TESTED Naked AC: 37 (10 +4 DEX, +11 WIS, +8 Tumble, +2 Armor Skin, +2 ???)<br>I don't know where the last 2 AC could come from, might be a bug... Or then I'm just forgetting something.<br><br>TESTED AB: 48: I'm missing 7 AB here, for some reason. It seems that Zen Archery doesn't work/show correctly:<br><br>6 Attacks Unarmed (AB 26/23/20/17/14/11)<br>4 Attacks Longbow (AB 48/43/38/33)<br><br>26 BAB + 11 WIS (Zen Archery), +1 WF, +2 EWF, +15 AA = 55 AB<br><br>compared to:<br><br>26 BAB + 4 DEX (dex modifier), +1 WF, +2 EWF, +15 AA = 48 AB<br><br>This might be already fixed, as I'm using 1.59, but I'm not sure.<br><br>FOR: 24<br>REF: 27<br>WIL: 32<br>_________________<br>"Lavamancers use three aspects of magic to make a golem: Transmutation; to mold the golem, Necromancery; to bind a soul to control the golem, and Evocation; to blast the damn thing on fire."<br>- Jushak Firestone - Grim Lavamancer<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 17:27</span></i></p>
