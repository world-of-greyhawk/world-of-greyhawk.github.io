Allo all! I decided I couldn't hide forever, and decided to try to make a relatively good level 40 character. Intrigued by the notion of a powerful mage in full plate, I decided to try out a Fighter/Wizard variant. With this build, I was aiming to grab Devastating Critical and as many Automatic Still Spell feats as I could, to override the full plate  . In any case, here is what I came up with. I'm trying to learn, so any and all feedback would be welcome.<br><br>Canon Protector (sounded cool)<br><br>Human<br><br>Attribute Starting Ending<br>Strength 14 25<br>Dexterity 14 14<br>Constitution 12 12<br>Wisdom 10 10<br>Intelligence 16 20<br>Charisma 10 10<br><br>Attacks +38/+33/+28<br>F/R/W 21/18/22<br>B Attack 25<br>SR 0<br>Damage 1-16+13<br>Nekkid AC 18<br><br>Skills<br>A *LOT* of skill points. Make sure to max Spellcraft and concentration. I also paid attention to Tumble and Discipline too. The other gazillion skill points, you can decide.<br><br>LEVEL PROGRESSION<br>-----------------<br>1 Fighter, Dodge, Mobility, Power Attack<br>2 Wizard, (Panther)<br>3 Fighter, Still Spell, Weapon Focus (Rapier)<br>4 Wizard, Int<br>5 Fighter<br>6 Wizard, Combat Casting<br>7 Figher, Weapon Spec(Rapier)<br>8 Wizard, Int<br>9 Fighter, Skill Focus(Concentration)<br>10 Wizard, Spell Penetration<br>11 Fighter, Imp.

Possible areas of improvement I can think up are:<br>1. Get Auto Still Spell III too<br>2. Get a *MUCH* better base AC.<br>3. Efficiency of Feats (many are filler, such as lvl 18 and 20)<br>4. More attacks per round/higher base attack.<br><br>Any help is welcome: my first build, and I wish it to be a learning experience. Thanks in advance .<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 02:57</span></i></p>
