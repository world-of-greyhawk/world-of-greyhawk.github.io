<i>Warning: Players are advised that numerous animals (including dires), beasts and magical beasts were harmed, dominated, trapped and killed during extensive play-testing of this build, PvP (level 40) and PvM (1-40)</i><br><br><b>SUPERNATURAL HUNTER (Shape-Shifter Slayer)</b><br>By Tyr and Company*<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>*Special Credits and Acknowledgments: I would like to thank Grim for his comments and never ending support throughout the building process (both as to story and to build, and other builds, such that he deserves equal credit for this build). Special thanks also goes out to Thax for his comments on an earlier draft of this build, and also to Bromium for piquing my curiosity about the Shape-Shifters in the first place, which ultimately led to this build. Posted below, along with a variant, is the actual build; what follows first is a ghost story, full of haunting lore about shape-shifters and other supernatural from Celt-Norse and elsewhere, in answer to the ultimate question: ever wonder where zombies and vampires, skin-walkers and demons (and demonic abilities to possess humans) *really* come from? (enjoy!) ~ Tyr <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">    ) </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><b><i> When the Hunted Becomes the Hunter: A Supernatural Tale</i></b><br><b><i> By Deborah “Tyr” Templar</i></b><br><br>There are things that are older than the rocks and the tree roots, which far pre-date Christianity, and are much scarier than ghosts; these old things are known in Celtic-Norse lore as being the “underground” people, who could not live on middle-earth among mortals. The underground people included many different beings, from dark dwarves and dark elves, to goblin-phantoms (in Anglo-France), and also trolls and changelings. Many had a penchant for stealing humans, newborn babies mostly, but some of the underground people also stole young lads and lasses, including brides who were in special danger of being kidnapped and eaten by trolls on their wedding night. Throughout Indo-Europe, these underground beings collectively came to be known as ‘supernatural’ (from whence the stories of demons and demonic possessions came, as subsequently recounted and told by Christians).<br><br>The scariest of the supernatural by far were changelings, who had the ability to shape-shift, to take the form of another being -- animal or human, whether living or dead, and they would often venture to middle-earth in order to baby swap, stealing a human child and leaving in its place either an adult changeling or its own deformed child (either way, the theft was hidden so far as the changeling – adult or child – would take the form of the stolen child, such that the stolen child’s parents were none the wiser about the theft until it was far too late); still other supernatural beings existed, especially among the Germanic, Ice Lander and Slavic peoples, which beings included a host of evil monsters and spirits involving the undead, otherwise known as the dead who refused to stay dead (draugr and Aptrgangr in Norse, or the “Walking Dead”); these beings were blood-suckers, vampire-like creatures and evil specters, who were known to venture out to feed on vermin and livestock; but it is for human flesh and blood they mainly hungered. Whether out of jealousy and contempt for the living, or simply out of a desire to taste more life, undead beings would feed on all who crossed their path at night. Walking undead are mostly revenants, but some are capable of shape-shifting, including female ghouls of Islamic lore and Russia’s erestsun (living-born evil vampire witches and sorcerers), enabling the supernatural to infiltrate the land of the living, and feed at will. <br><br>Whereas the Australians, Japanese, Arabs, Greeks and Africans speak of half human/half animal beasts, others have witnessed shape-shifting dragons and dragon-like beasts, with parallel tales told by the Native American peoples. There being Cherokee lore of witches and wizards shape-shifting into elemental forms, tormenting ill persons until they are dead, and then eating the liver to extend their own lives by as many days as they stole. The Abenaki tell a tale of an old male witch comparable to an undead vampire. But even more fearful is Mexico’s tlahuelpuchi, an evil shape-shifting female human who can cast magic and assume animal forms, having psychic powers over human minds, and who sucks the life-blood from human infants.<br><br>The next time you open your door to a strange knock in the night, will it bring you any comfort at all to know that other world cultures have seen and affirmed the existence of what Nordic-Celts have long suspected: that in the dark and well-hidden places lurk things that are older than the rocks and the tree roots, such that the human race is not alone? <br><br>But as surely as there are supernatural walking unnaturally among humans on earth, who live deep beneath the earth and come up from under the rocks or otherwise to feed on or kidnap and trade places with humans, there are also those brave few humans who have dedicated their lives to tracking supernatural down and killing them. These hunter-trackers are known as the supernatural hunters, who specialize in ensuring that the dead stay dead, and unnatural things are evicted from the land of the living. <br><br>Some of these hunters came into their occupation through generational training, in the same way that a parent hands down a family trade or business to his or her child, while others felt the need to answer a special calling. A few, however, came into the job to exact revenge for a loved one, to kill the evil undead or other supernatural who preyed on a family member; while all things who specialize in killing things are dangerous, this particular brand of supernatural hunter, the one who stumbles onto the job out of a need to avenge the death of a loved one, is typically the most dangerous of all, more dangerous even than the supernatural he hunts: for with each kill, another supernatural gone, only makes this breed of hunter hunger for more. In time, the hunter’s hatred and insatiable quest for revenge against the supernatural only begins to wear down the very thing which drove the hunter into action in the first place -that of her humanity: when all compassion for the hunted thing is lost, even although it is only but a thing she hunts, does she not begin to resemble the very thing she hunts?<br><br>The Supernatural Hunter, Shape-Shifter Slayer, is the latter kind of hunter; one who kills and relishes the hunt, who came into the job for the purpose of avenging the loss of a sibling taken by a vampire-like creature, a skin-walker. For years Hunter studied matters of the supernatural, training hard and long, and learning about specialized techniques and the tools required to kill these beings, all the while searching high and low for his lost sister until one day the Hunter came upon a cave in the woods where lived what was thought to be the being responsible for kidnapping his sister; cautiously, but without fear, having prepared himself and his tool bag for whatever horrors lay beyond, Hunter entered the cave, his tools readied and waiting, and hoping, to free his sister. He was barely inside the cave when suddenly standing before him was a supernatural, with long canine-like fangs and claws, and it was hissing; the being did not look like a supernatural monster, however; rather, the being appeared in form to be his sister. Reacting, quickly, driven as much by horror as by hatred, Hunter drove his silver-tipped iron knives deep into the thing and wrestled with it; he took it to the ground at which point he cut at its neck cord, and decapitated it; reaching next into his tool bag he pulled out a torch, which he lit, and then put to the severed pieces. He took quiet pleasure as he set the thing ablaze, watching as it burst into flame and its parts react, as if the thing were wreathing in pain. Soon, it was over: the thing reduced by the flames to nothing more than two smile piles of harmless ashes. “The dead should stay dead,” muttered Hunter to himself.  <br><br>But whether it was a shape-shifter who had killed Hunter’s sister and thereafter passed itself off as her by taking her form, or whether it was in fact Hunter’s sister, ravaged by a disease bled into her so as to herself become a shape-shifter, it mattered not to Hunter anymore: on coming to the stark realization that his sister was dead and forever lost, a piece of Hunter’s humanity also died that day. On that day, he vowed to pour himself into his studies, to learn even more about the things he hunted, and to go out of his way forever more to hunt them all down, and kill them. His would be a life thereafter dedicated to ensuring that every supernatural, regardless of its name or form, would suffer the consequences for what the one of them had done to his sister. <br><br>It was on this day that he became the Supernatural Hunter. <br><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; Other Builds:<br>Supernatural Hunter is unique.

While there’s no such thing as too much AC, the Supernatural Hunter’s AC is just as good as (if not even better than) a plate-wearing WM (thanks to tumble (assassin), and especially nice on a strength-based ranger); fort and reflex saves are also quite decent (bolstered by non-dispellable ranger spells, UMD), and s/he enjoys over 500 HPs (also very nice on a ranger); will save is low, however, and you’ll want to get clarity potions and/or put your UMD to good use, and shore it up<br><br>•	Special Skills -- Animal Empathy (Ranger Foci): as if all of the above is not enough, Supernatural Hunter’s specialized ranger skills lets him/her dominate enemies quite literally at will – i.e., all neutral and hostile animals (incl. dires), beasts and magical beasts (dominates NPCs, dazes PCs (i.e., shape-shifter forms); also incredibly useful to “steal” enemy summons, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    <br><br>Without any further ado, please meet the Supernatural Hunter (shape-shifter slayer, followed by the natural born killer variant):<br>_________________<br>Dead I am the one, Exterminating son; Slipping through the trees, strangling the breeze; I am the rat, feast upon the cat; Tender is the fur, dying as you purr; Dig through the ditches, Burn through the witches…Burn like an animal ~ Zombie, Dragula (1998)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 08/07/07 21:10</span></i></p>

Its strong offensively, there is no doubt. But in defense I'm a little worried. Dex 8 for a light armour wearer? You state 29 AC with full plate and so, but then you suffer -4 and -8 to AB rolls, leaving you a rather medicore fighter.<br>And with +5 items, mage armour wont give you anything, since its +1 natural, armour, dodge and deflect, that you allready have on items, and they do not stack.<br><br>And when it comes to gear and buffs, you must always assume others have the same, thus making 50 AC with +5 gear something your own build will hit on 16 of 20 rolls, or with a +5 weapon, every single hit will go in.<br><br>So I'm wondering, what happens should you run into an archer or a dexer build? They'll have you down before you can even land a single of your massive hits on them.<br><br>All over interesting and powerful, but dreadfully weak defensively, and for any fighter, even with stealth, thats an important issue as well.<br><br>You could drop starting strenght to 16, taking 11 dex instead, and swapping one great str feat for dex, boosting base AC by 2 for the loss of 1 AB and damage.

Of course not, but it is what it is – then again, apart from spells, arcanists don’t exactly dish any damage apart from their damage shields, right? (Reason also why you want HPs and serious damage output when up against anything like that, imo – otherwise, if you don't, you’re pretty much toast; that said, what suffers here in exchange for AB and damage are his skills, having to pick for instance b/w stealth and deadly traps, but that’s the price, and way worth it imo since s/he has what s/he needs anyway, incl. full disc., tumble, and umd, among other things); second, this build is focused (as all good supernatural hunters in past I imagine were, yes?) <br><br>That said, and unless otherwise stated, my response is directed at the second variant (i.e., Natural Born Killer), seeing as your comments/questions are directed at fighting other PCs/classes as opposed to going after druid-shifter/shape-shifters (to which the first variant is directed, both pvm and pvp, and hence the 3 extra FEs (i.e., a nice natural ab to begin with, now bring on that bane power vs. all major forms-plus (you got it covered), along w. Animal Empathy to dominate/daze ‘em (totally fun, it is, it really, really is, and darn neat also to be able to steal your enemies’ summons); by contrast, Natural Born Killer (you’re right) is focused instead on playable races (hence, only 7 FEs, as there are only 7 pc races of course to cover) that said, both are highly playable PvM obviously, but in light of your great question, we’re focusing here on pvp obviously; and with that, let the tutorial begin.<br><br><br>AC and AB – as the commercial sez, all-natural is good for you       <br><br>Typical Warrior, in +5 environs:<br>Warrior AC: 10 base, +1 dex, +4 tumble, +8 plate: 23 (26 shield) / +5 environs (+20 gear): 43 (51 w. +5 tower shield, but cut back seriously on damage imo, and less AC anyway than what Hunter has in leather, dual-wielding, no shield, in that same +5 environs (see below)<br><br>Warrior AB: 45, +6 STR, +5 weapon: 56/51/46/41 (note, not bad, but only 4 more than what Hunter has on his own – i.e., without any equipment/umd, Hunter has an AB 52 (as noted); but you’re right, what your foe can get, you of course get, too: so let’s do that, shall we? Let’s gear Hunter up (and see why when you start out strong to begin with, as here, you’re only that much better w. magic, not dependent on it, but rather augmented by it, hence making you only that much more better as compared to those that otherwise needed it, yes? <br><br>(and here’s why): <br><br>Now that we’ve seen the “good” warrior, let’s compare that to the Hunter:<br>Mundane Studded Leather: 22, +2 Cat's, or 24 AC (27 w. shield); assuming +5 items, dex, haste, umd/mage armor (+1 dodge portion, as noted above): 52 AC (60 shield)<br><br>NOTE: 52 AC, in leather, dual-wielding, and NO SHIELD (better than a WM, in plate and shield, right?

Cool builds, Tyr, and I hope I got those quotes straightened out for you. <br><br>One minor quibble with your analysis re the Natural Born Killer vs the Warrior: you're assuming said warrior will only have +4 AC from Tumble, but don't you think it's highly more likely said warrior would actually have Bard or Rogue (or possibly Monk, SD, or Assassin) levels to top out Tumble as well - especially in a PvP environment? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>*edit* And the Warrior would very likely have Expertise in his bag of tricks as well. As you noted though, he probably can't compete on a damage-dealing level though.<br><br>*edit 2* One more thing as well: your NBK's 52 AC is assuming Haste, yet you're not giving the Warrior Haste as well.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 08/09/07 05:42</span></i></p>

Agreed, Cin.  Also, with only 1 level of Assassin(or 2 in the variant), and that coming near the end, why Assassin at all?  Why the forced alignment restriction for one level of UMD?  I can see that you are trying to avoid an xp panalty in the 2nd, but the first doesn't really suffer from that complex given its current make-up.<br><br>This is related to the next issue:  perhaps it's listed somewhere in your preamble or epilogue, but I couldn't find whether this is a PvP or PvM build, and if it's playable from 1-40, and if for low or mid or high magic.  I'm assuming it's PvM starting somewhere in the 20s?  and for at least Mid Magic given the assumptions about keen kukris and Haste and so forth.<br><br>Since the first build doesn't acquire its lone Assassin level unto the late 30's, I assume he is playable even though until that point he's just a melee-type with low AC and average hit points.  Same for the second, who must wait for 22 seasons before seeing the light of Tumble and UMD.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 08/09/07 11:47</span></i></p>

Hey, Cinn: thanks for fixing up the thread, appreciate it, and your kind compliment, too. As to your quibble, no quibble at all – fact is, most melee’rs simply do not take UMD (you’d be surprised, but it’s true that they don’t; they also don’t train up their detection either, but we’ll come back to that …<br><br>This is a good discussion, thanks! And alright then, for the sake of carrying on our discussion (forgetting the real averages), then let’s give said Warrior UMD and assume s/he took a tumble class (like we here do <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      <br><br>The result would be as follows:<br><br>Warrior AC: 10 base, +1 dex, +4 tumble, +8 plate: 23 (26 shield) / +5 environs (+20 gear): 43 (51 w. +5 tower shield), if we give them a UMD and add a tumble class (so, +4 tumble, +4 haste, +1 umd/mage armor: 52 AC (60 shield, add +5 expert. and guess what, <br><br>As I said at the outset of the Supernatural Hunter in the first place, re: this build:<br><br>• Nice Defense. While there’s no such thing as too much AC, the Supernatural Hunter’s AC is just as good as (if not better than) a plate-wearing WM <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     <br><br>To Skippnuttz: Melee’r AC isn’t the greatest, I agree; however, it is what it is, and as we’ve established, one more time, the Hunter has EXACT SAME or BETTER THAN any str.based/plate-wielding melee build. Also, once again, this build doesn’t survive via AC, it survives through damage.<br><br>As to rogue, yeah, could do that Grizz (and bang on why assassin in second one (and gets uncanny also, not the end-all/be-all on a str-based ranger build, but can come in handy on a leather wearer w dex-AC, don’t ya think?)  That said, apart from theme, could easily trade in that 1 assassin for a rogue if you want, at level 40, so no xp burden; but there’s no forced alignment change whatsoever here, Grizz: you start CE and end CE – there’s no alignment change; assassins are evil, but rangers and fighters aren't restricted from any alignment and can be anything they want (apart of course from the assassin req’t, which is any evil). But if on the first one you prefer rogue over assassin (as skippnuttz says, “More skill points going 1 rogue vs 1 Assassin.” Sad, but true), then don’t have to be CE if don’t want to be: by all means, go CN if you like (we’ll come back to that <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     <br><br>Other questions:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;SKIPPNUTTZ<br>….54-55 Discipline on a STR tank in unacceptible.

Problem with ‘em though, unless have 25+ paladin in em, they’re dispellable (incl. the cha buffs/spells they rely on for things like the divines, imo); also, lousy skill set, and no detection skills (sneak right past ‘em; then again, this is true for most melee builds – most players don’t, and it’s a fact, they just don’t train their detection); while that holy sword is sexy, heh, I agree, it’s only once per day and doesn’t last very long; but even assuming enough levels of paladin taken to make the GRT Smites of which you speak worthwhile, only 3 of em a day and once they’re all gone…. Then, and while there are many ways to deal w. a paladin, the purpose of this build is not to assassinate paladins; If that’s your cup-of-tea, then simply exchange your 1 level of assassin for 1 rogue, adjust accordingly, and go CN (no brainer, folks: the easiest way to deal with a paladin-smiter is to deny said paladin their smite by going neutral (heh, poor pally --- all that wasted charisma, so no ab or damage as a result as against you … guess your animal companion will be enjoying paladin toast for breakfast <br><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; I love STR Rangers, </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I do, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      <br><br>Actually, str-based rangers are great, and players are always free to adjust as they want of course (and should always feel free to do so; by all means, feel free to make it an elf if you want too, although it would cost a feat and a bunch of skill points, you’d get 2 free dex but lose 2 con stats (not to mention xp burdens - there's no wood elf in NWN, but aren’t they great in NWN2? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     <br><br>What I like about this build, IMO is that it’s a ranger, enjoying WM-like precision (high AB and lethal damage output); proof-positive that rangers are not tree huggers, but solid, strong, and capable warriors.

Leather or Full Plate? In the initial PvP assault, and mid-combat, are you going to go Leather or Full Plate?  PvM might offer such luxuries in switching, but even that is tenuous at best, as some worlds won't allow for changing out of leather into Full Plate in the heat of combat.

Having established the alternate discipline path, (w. rogue definitely on BoW, where there are REAL smiters (meh, not pally-rogue-cot's, but the real thing, like one of mine or Gim's btw AB 40 minimum, now bring on the rest, including cha and GS X --- those be the one's ya gotta worry about when you're evil (then, what evil build doesn't, so true, so true: so, yeah, if on your world, go rogue/CN and thus avoid the issue altogether, this is true, and well said)<br><br>otherwise, dexers aren't really an issue (they deal so little damage, and themselves have no discipline; as noted, go SF/ESF disc. route on Hunter (and reason why it's there, and useful vs. PC dragons, too) as it's not him on his back, but his foes (esp. dem dexers), keeping in mind also his foes move at the min. 10% thanks to grease, have their invis (incl. any impr.invis. cover they were hoping to rely on) stripped; <br><br>Of course, if surrounded by pesky sneakers a lot then, yeah, by all means, feel free to train up detection too -(and that's a good idea, Skipp); folks, as I've always said, since players are the one's who know their own worlds best, they are free to (and should) adjust for their world (heh heh, and on the world of which you speak, anything under 25 caster is completely dispelled, so the team w. the sweetest singing bard and/or mage who fires off the first round of dispels as a general rule wins. yes? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>That said, and having already established frankly and for the last time though a) his AC is as good or better than any other melee build, b. his Natural AB being on par with a WM and c. his Natural damage, ITWF + awesome crit. range, being str-based w. double bang on not only ws/ews, but also FE and Bane is better, and in fact, is without question lethal (psst. final word on the subject: pally-cot-rogues have equal or less than 400 HPs in general, which he does in but a couple hits, once you factor in those crits -- sorry, but unless something's got high EDR, well ... that's right, most dexers etc. don't (and even if did, well, again, natural UNDISPELLABLE STATS does Hunter have, with his bane+ITWF etc. cuts through EDR, and no immunity might I add is there to be found for anyone anywhere vs. FE/bane either <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">     <br><br>Totally 'nuff said on that, really; truly, this ain't the place to talk about how to take down different combos, and their weaknesses. But, really, if worried about a pally, all's I say is, don't: a. go rogue, and no problem (this is true); but regardless, in a few rounds at most, pally cha-turns run out, such that pally become pumpkins ... but to say anymore about it (or the weaknesses of anything else) would be so off-topic at this point, in order to come back on topic, would love to see how a dexer or anything else that's dispellable, sneak and/or smite reliant, with zero ab and/or damage in a low magic world especially (or in a mid-magic once dispelled either) is gonna dare come up against a druid or shifter ...<br><br>a. druid/druid-shifters dispel (hence, the need for natural, undispellable stats -- Hunter's AB 48, +4 self-buffs: 52 AB, and not dispellable; AB 60 w. str and a mere +5 weapon); you need at least a +3 weapon to breach elementals DR imo, and not so easy to come by on a no magic/low magic world (in which case, Hunter has Blade Thirst, hence, he comes w. a +3 weapon (cast on both kukris, and w. nothing more, you're ready to go); on top of that, druids got a really nice animal companion and lots of animal summons (so, too, does Hunter, who can steal his foes w. SF/ESF animal empathy; otherwise, go (as noted) Discipline); many shapes as you no doubt know are also sneak immune, and w/ druid-shifters being neutral by prereq., means they're completely smite immune, too (so, too is Hunter readily and easily made smite immune if go rogue, on which we're agreed as necessary, and already and for the last time said); but his damage is neither from smite, nor is it derived from sneak (the 2d6 he gets (1d6 x's 2 kukris) be just a nice little bonus, but that's all it is --- rather, and unlike others (and especially dexers), his damage is STR based, w. WS/EWS, coupled with high FE and Bane charged damage vs. all ... as such, his damage is neither restricted, nor is is avoided, since none of the shapes are immune to any of this (nor are pc races, either, imo), and especially when you're critting on a 12(which occurs, once again, 60% of the time), hence, doubling it all -- enemies simply don't live long enough to hit back. Yes, some (like dragons and undeads) are crit immune, others (like dragon, elementals and gargoyle) have DR, but w. ITWF and the double-bang you get on all that you got (especially FE and Bane, just don't get any better than that), truth be told: he slices through that EDR rather quickly too (and works great I might add, vis-a-vis epic warding <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">     <br><br>Nuff said ... as I'm not going to go through every shape (or potential class combo, as this isn't the place for it either, having already said more than enough): final note, and on which you'll get no argument from me, is to go SF/ESF disc. if playing pvp in general, or if only really interested in going after PC dragons anyway, as I have already said, and for the umpteenth time said, both in the build, and throughout the discussion); as to those shapes and their stats, it's in the wiki, a link to which I'm happy to provide as follows: <br><br>Druids and their shapes:<br><a href="http://www.nwnwiki.org/Druid" target="_blank">http://www.nwnwiki.org/Druid</a><br>Shifters and their shapes:<br><a href="http://www.nwnwiki.org/Shifter" target="_blank">http://www.nwnwiki.org/Shifter</a><br>_________________<br>Dead I am the one, Exterminating son; Slipping through the trees, strangling the breeze; I am the rat, feast upon the cat; Tender is the fur, dying as you purr; Dig through the ditches, Burn through the witches…Burn like an animal ~ Zombie, Dragula (1998)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 08/12/07 04:35</span></i></p>
