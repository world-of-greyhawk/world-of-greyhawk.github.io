I was trying for something that captured all three of the Epic Casting Feats (Auto Still, Silent &amp; Quicken) whilst retaining a reasonable base spellcasting dc, Heavy Armor ability, Epic Warding &amp; Epic Mage Armor, a broad skillset (hence Bard) and two maxed spell foci (Enchantment &amp; Evocation). Sadly there is no room for Armor Skin, Epic Prowess or further Great Intelligence. Auto Silent Spell I-III eluded me here as well. I feel there is a way to do it, but not with this class mix or split, without seriously decreasing the offensive potential of the build.<br><br>Anyway here you go...<br><br>Human <br>Wizard 38/ Fighter 1/ Bard 1<br>PvM 1-40<br><br>STR: 12<br>DEX: 12<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 18 (32)<br>CHA: 8<br><br>01: Wizard(1): Spell Focus: Enchantment, Extend Spell, {Scribe Scroll}<br>02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Longsword<br>03: Wizard(2): Silent Spell<br>04: Wizard(3): INT+1, (INT=19)<br>05: Wizard(4)<br>06: Wizard(5): Empower Spell, Greater Spell Focus: Enchantment<br>07: Wizard(6)<br>08: Wizard(7): INT+1, (INT=20)<br>09: Wizard(8): Quicken Spell<br>10: Wizard(9)<br>11: Wizard(10): Spell Focus: Evocation<br>12: Wizard(11): INT+1, Still Spell, (INT=21)<br>13: Wizard(12)<br>14: Wizard(13)<br>15: Wizard(14): Toughness<br>16: Wizard(15): INT+1, Greater Spell Focus: Evocation, (INT=22)<br>17: Wizard(16)<br>18: Wizard(17): Blind Fight<br>19: Wizard(18)<br>20: Wizard(19): INT+1, (INT=23)<br>21: Wizard(20): Great Intelligence I, Great Intelligence II, (INT=25)<br>22: Wizard(21)<br>23: Wizard(22)<br>24: Wizard(23): INT+1, Great Intelligence III, Great Intelligence IV, (INT=28)<br>25: Wizard(24)<br>26: Wizard(25)<br>27: Wizard(26): Automatic Still Spell I, Automatic Still Spell II<br>28: Wizard(27): INT+1, (INT=29)<br>29: Wizard(28)<br>30: Wizard(29): Automatic Quicken Spell I, Automatic Still Spell III<br>31: Wizard(30)<br>32: Wizard(31): INT+1, (INT=30)<br>33: Wizard(32): Epic Spell: Epic Warding, Automatic Quicken Spell II<br>34: Wizard(33)<br>35: Wizard(34)<br>36: Wizard(35): INT+1, Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor, Automatic Quicken Spell III, (INT=31)<br>37: Wizard(36)<br>38: Wizard(37)<br>39: Wizard(38): Epic Spell Focus: Enchantment, Epic Spell Focus: Evocation<br>40: Bard(1): INT+1, (INT=32)<br><br>Hitpoints: 288<br>Skillpoints: 423<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 20/20/17<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +10<br>BAB: 20<br>AB (max, naked): 22 (melee), 21 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 19/30<br>Spell Casting: Wizard(9)<br><br>Skills: <br>Appraise 39(50), Concentration 43(45), Discipline 43(44), Hide 43(44), Listen 43(42), Lore 39(51), Move Silently 43(44), Perform 4(3), Spellcraft 43(54), Tumble 40(41), UMD 43(42)<br><br>Bard was taken for the skill dump available to Tumble, UMD, Discipline and Appraise in the main.

I would skip the auto-quicken feats. If you are hasted, they have no effect, and since you can cast haste, you should almost always be hasted even without perma-haste items, which you will probably also have.<br><br>That frees up 4 feats. I would replace them with Maximize, and if you want the auto-silent line. Although I also think you could just take auto-silent I-II to let you cast Greater Dispelling if you get silenced. Then you have 1 left for Armor Skin.<br><br>TM

The Quicken Feats are taken to remove the casting penalty that will result (even when hasted) as both Combat Casting and Improved Combat Casting are not selected. The net effect is to remove the AoO's whilst casting in melee. <br><br>You will still suffer these if just hasted and you have no Quicken or ICC feats.<br><br>As for Maximise, for me its a case of which one I go with Maximise or Empower.<br><br>Generally I favor Empower because it only takes a slot 2 levels higher, rather than 3 levels higher, and you have a chance of achieving 1.5 x the net effect, as opposed to 100% dead set all the time. Call me an optimist I suppose!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 02/15/06 15:16</span></i></p>

Well, in that case I would take CC and ICC, and still have 2 left (maximize and armor skin, or auto-silent I-II, or EP and Armor Skin, etc.). Four feats is a lot to spend just to avoid AoO's, especially since once you take the Bard level and bump Tumble you will be able to avoid them anyway.<br><br>TM

Hmm.. good point. Will have to think on that.

Is this toon intended for PvP?  Haste will drop at the most inopportune moment or a Mord's gets casted on you. now you are up the creek but with Quicken you still get your speed casts at least.<br><br>Minor globe to combat silence is another way around.

One last suggestion - you can also drop WF: longsword. With your low AB and no EWF, EP, low Str, etc., you won't be hitting much anyway, and the +1 won't make much difference. You would be better off spending that feat on a metamagic feat, spell focus, skill focus, CC, or save booster. That's 5 feats freed up for other better stuff.<br><br>TM
