You didn't specify a race, so I went with human.<br><br>2. I don't know what kind of level-advancement you're going to have on that PW of yours, so if you want to get Outsider Shape at an earlier level, I can revise the build to account for that.<br><br>3. I found the following color arrangements to be particularly Rakshasa-like (especially on females), if you want to try them out (this is assuming you're using all the tattoos):<br><br>4. No druid or wizard spells can be cast in Rakshasa form.<br><br>Skin: Far right column, Three up (Dark Red)<br>Hair: 2 over from the bottom left corner (Orange-ish)<br>Tatoo 1: 3 up, 3 over from bottom-left (Orange)<br>Tatoo 2: Far right column, 5 up (Black)<br><br>The original build had 8 levels of Weapon Master in Quarterstaff (for melee power), but for whatever reason, Magical Staves (what a Rakshasa form uses) do not count as quarterstaves. So, Wizard levels were the next best alternative. You can get two panther companions, as any self-respecting Rakshasa should have, (one at level 20, the other at level 9), and cast spells like True Strike, Shield, Mage Armor, Haste, Cloud of Bewilderment, Gust of Wind, Improved Invisibility, Lesser Spell Breach, and Isaac's Lesser Missle Storm while in human form. Also, Still Spell and Auto Still Spell were useless in Rakshasa form; any equipped armor doesn't carry over after the shift.<br><br>Edited By Wildeyes on 03/20/04 13:59:04<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/26/08 08:05</span></i></p>
