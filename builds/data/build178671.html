<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM or PvP Build</b><br><br>I've been updating some of my old builds, since the game has changed a bit (patches) from when they were first done.  The first revised build I'm submitting is the Magical Marauder.  I was always disapointed with the low fortitude save, but didn't realize until I was tinkering with it that, with a few minor changes, I could get it up to 37.  With a fortitude save that high, he doesn't have to worry too much about devastating critical.  If he is playing on a no magic items server, you may want to switch the greatsword focus to a long sword focus.  With Tenser's Transformation, his fortitude save would be increased to 43, although his strength would be lowered so his own DC would suffer.  Feel free to comment.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br>-Level 9 illusionist spells.  This character has full mage casting abilities, however because of his low level his SR and DCs will be low.<br>-Full fighter attacks per round and AB of 40 with a Greatsword.  He can almost fight as well as a pure fighter, against any opponent he can't beat as a mage he can pummel as a fighter.<br>-Automatic Still Spell 3.  He can cast in full plate.<br>-Devastating Critical.<br>-Epic Warding.  He can take quite alot of punishment.<br>-Good fortitude saves and saves vs. spells.  With a 37 fortitude save he has a good chance against devastating critical attacks, though he should still try to buff his CON and get a bonus to saves (If he runs into a Half-orc RDD with a 44 STR he'll get dev. critted but against the average fighter with a 30 STR he'll do okay).  He should also do well against most spell casters.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br>-Mediocre hitpoints.  Just over 400 hitpoints, good for a mage but poor for a fighter.<br>-Low AC.  With damage reduction and concealment spells, this isn't a problem unless his opponent has devastating critical.<br>-No Evasion or Improved Evasion.  His spells provide some spell resistance, but a spell mantle doesn't last long in a mage battle.<br>-Low base wisdom and reflex saves.  He'll have trouble with monstrous effects, though mind-blank should handle will saves.<br><br><b>Magical Marauder V. 2</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Human<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Any non evil<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 16<br>DEX 8<br>CON 16<br>INT 16<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>Leveling Guide</i><br>Levels 1-2 Fighter<br>Levels 3-6 Wizard<br>Levels 7-11 Fighter<br>Levels 12-20 Champion of Torm<br>Levels 21-37 Wizard<br>Level 38 Champion of Torm<br>Level 39 Wizard<br>Level 40 Fighter<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Champion of Torm 10<br>Fighter 8<br>Wizard 22<br><br><i>Spell School</i> Illusion<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>All 10 attribute bonuses go to strength<br><br><i>Feats</i><br>Level 1: Weapon Focus (Greatsword), Toughness, Luck of Heroes<br>Level 2: Knockdown<br>Level 3: Still Spell<br>Level 6: Combat Casting<br>Level 8: Weapon Specialization (Greatsword)<br>Level 9: Great Fortitude<br>Level 10: Improved Critical (Greatsword)<br>Level 12: Improved Knockdown<br>Level 13: Power Attack<br>Level 15: Extend Spell, Blind-Fight<br>Level 17: Cleave<br>Level 18: Silent Spell<br>Level 19: Great Cleave<br>Level 21: Great Intelligence I, Epic Weapon Focus (Greatsword)<br>Level 24: Epic Prowess<br>Level 26: Great Intelligence II<br>Level 27: Epic Fortitude<br>Level 30: Overwhelming Critical (Greatsword)<br>Level 31: Great Intelligence III<br>Level 33: Automatic Still Spell I<br>Level 36: Automatic Still Spell II, Automatic Still Spell III<br>Level 38: Devastating Critical (Greatsword)<br>Level 39: Epic Spell (Epic Warding)<br>Level 40: Epic Weapon Specialization (Greatsword)<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 26<br>DEX 8<br>CON 16<br>INT 19<br>WIS 8<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>Final Saves (Vs.

Magical Marauder started to be strong now! Unlike his previous version, this one would actually be a formidable opponent for Arcane Knight - although who the winner would be would depend strongly on skill of players fighting the battle.

Maybe this is a silly question, but why go Human with this build?  If you went Dwarven, you would have -2 Cha but +2 Con.  You'd lose 1 feat (probably Luck of Heroes), so your saves would be down by 1, but with the +2 Con your Fort save would stay the same, and you'd still have +40 HP.  <br><br>Of course, you'd also lose some skill credits, so your Spot and Taunt skills would be down a little, but I don't see Taunt being all that useful to a build with 8 Cha, especially when you only put 21 points into it.  Spot would probably be a little more useful, but with True Seeing it shouldn't be an issue.

You are right, that an extra 40 HP would be nice, but you have to balance that with -1 to reflexes and will (luck of heroes) though dwarfs do get a racial +2 to all spell saves.  Taunt works well against all those fighter builds that don't take any concentration ranks and spot is useful because you can't always have true sight up.  It's often more useful to have up clairaudience/clairvoyance and save true seeing for when you really need it.  The lower charisma would also limit his ability to buff and use divine wrath or lay on hands.  If you wan't to, then by all means make the switch, though I consider it a lateral move.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 02/03/05 23:04</span></i></p>
