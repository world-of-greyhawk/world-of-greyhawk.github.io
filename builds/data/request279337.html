OK... hopefully I get this right this time.

I played the Iron Archer before and it was a lot of fun.<br><br>Basically, your differences are that the Iron Archer is DEX-oriented and more of a dedicated archer. High CON is taken instead of pouring points into extreme DEX or into STR. Very little melee combat potential due to the low STR.<br><br>Soldier of Fortune has fewer HPs, but is adept at both melee and range.<br><br>I'd say the Iron Archer is better suited to being a party-based ranged attacker that can take some punishment. Don't take this the wrong way though, as he's still deadly in close combat with a bow (excellent AB) and can certainly be soloed (I played it as a solo character). However, he'll really shine in a party.<br><br>Soldier of Fortune can really solo due to the ability to fight from range or in melee.<br><br>Either one is a good choice.

I highly appreciate the input... and yes, I think I'll go with the "Half-Elven Soldier of Fortune".  I do tend to do quite a lot of soloing mixed in with group adventuring.  Again, thank you.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">
