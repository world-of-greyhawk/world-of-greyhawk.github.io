<b>Foreword</b><br>While the Bloodlust is the correct version of Wrathful Berserker, this one is more of an extension of Bloodlust but done differently. But I really think him more as son of Bloodlust... he followed his father footstep but has some extra training done and does thing differently than Sr. Hence the name Bloodlust Jr. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   Perhaps story should explain it.. I hope.<br><br>Oh, here's the link to Bloodlust(Sr.)... <br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "313058", "0", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Bloodlust Sr.</a><br><br>Ah, I also wanted to mention, I tested this in new mod, it was tough test. With this build, I equipped normal fullplate and greataxe. Had the setting on hard and all creatures that Jr. killed had +7 or so equipment on, basically HotU equipped. But again, that could not be a true test since they could be crappy NPC to begin with… I didn’t take a look in the mod. Oh, here’s the link to mod I tested this in…<br><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Modules.Detail&amp;id=398" target="_blank">Boot Camp</a><br><br>I do not know if this mod is as good as other.. I wanted to try something different and wanted to see if this one works as well as others... Bloodlust Jr. is the first build I have tried this in. He lasted pretty well for normal equipped character verus those with HotU equipments. Check it out if you want.<br><br>While Bloodlust is still my favorite, it depends on what type of mod I am going to be playing in. I probably will be using this one as well.<br><br><b>Story</b><br>You see a two shadowy people sitting directly across from each other around the campfire. There is a boar roasting directly above the fire and the right fight was of large physique leaned forward and yanked one of the legs off the boar.<br><br>"Son, there's nothing like raging and instilling fear in all of those before you. But I tell you, you will run into some who won't be and will be inclined to stick a knife in your back."<br><br>"Yeah yeah.... I already watched some of those people who walk among the shadows and I have learned some things that you would find useful... especially the vulnerable spots to hit if you know where to look." said Junior.<br><br>"Bah! You may have point but I prefer all out brawl with my axe and just smash them on their heads!" Bloodlust shakes his axe and smashes it into the log beside him. The log shattered in pieces, the axe remained rooted in the ground.<br><br>Bloodlust yanked off the meat off the leg with his teeth and spoke as he chewed.<br><br>"Ah, son, I am still glad that you have followed in my footstep for most and have taken some more training than I would have. We both have our ways of killing things. As long as you remember where you came from, I am fine with it. May the barbarians live long short life!"<br><br>"May death do us honor!" said Bloodlust Jr. as he drank the ale.<br><br>"Hush! I hear someone... git... circle behind and get ready." said Bloodlust as he yanked out the axe from the ground. Son was nowhere to be seen.<br><br>Several minutes later, Bloodlust heard a rustling. A big creature that towered over him by at least five heads, a giant perhaps, wielding a scythe appeared. Behind it, eight smaller humanoids followed, they all had assorted weapons. The giant one snarled and did a rasping laugher. "Food... it is mine now. You puny move on."<br><br>"Eh? What did you say? I couldn't understand you with all of this crud in my ears..." he is nonchalantly picking his right ear with his right pinkie finger. He is still leaning on his axe and some distance away from the giant.<br><br>*SNORT!* the giant snorted and made a threatening move. "I SAID YOU PUNY MOVE ON! FOOD MINE!"<br><br>"What? I am sorry, I still got some crud in my ears, I am not hearing so well today, I must be getting old." He is still feigning the flicking of his fingers of the crud and checking his fingernails.<br><br>The giant lost it and roared while lunging at Bloodlust.<br><br>While the giant was slashing and missing, Bloodlust Jr. came behind the eight onlookers. “Well, well what do we have here? What a puny little playthings!” He laughed and roared at them. “Let the earth take you!”<br><br>The little ones scattered, running in random direction. Jr. picked them off one by one. Jr. used his knowledge of exploiting the chance of attacking to inflict more pain. He particularly enjoyed it little too much...<br><br>“Well, it seems that your little boyfriends have abandoned you, albeit too late.” Taunting, Bloodlust attempts to force the giant into making a mistake. A near miss from the scythe, he decided that time of play was over and roared at giant. “Let the earth take you!”<br><br>The giant was much tougher than Sr. anticipated. He was tough enough that Jr. had to join the fray.<br><br>Hours later, you see flickering of fire from campfire through the severed head of the giant stuck to the ground on a stick, presuming on a broken scythe.<br><br>“Alright, I will admit that attacking from behind has merit, but still... I prefer the front. You can attack from behind if you like.” Said Bloodlust as he sat down and yanked off another leg off the boar.<br><br><b>Character</b><br>Bloodlust

Switch with Epic Toughness if you want more HP.<br><b>Notes:</b><br>Same as Bloodlust, he gets 10% bonus to movement, Uncanny Doduge VI+, DR of 8/- and can rage nine times a day. However, in this version, he also recieves Evasion and sneak attacks.<br><br>I also want to mention that I have selected Iron Will because, frankly his will saves is in dire need of some boost early.<br><br>You can get Devastating Critical earlier if you switch Terrifying Rage to last. But the point of this build is to terrify his opponents, so I took that first. But if you don't care about that, you can move it around and get it at level 30.<br><br>The reason I took rogue at certain levels was to maximize the tumble and UMD at specific level and to avoid XP penalty. <br><br>Sure, you could one level, anyone can do that. But you won't have benefit of tumble and UMD.<br><br>The benefit of at least four level of rogue seems more useful since you are also getting evasion and sneak attacks and by taking it pre-epic and post epic, you are also maximizing your AC via Tumble skill and have ability to use most of items with UMD at certain levels. And those would come in use if you come across many restricted items.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 11/18/09 20:43</span></i></p>

Ah... much more comfortable for me.  I'd probably drop some barb for fighter levels, but that would result in an XP penalty.  Doesn't really matter much though.  This is a template I can endorse.

CAVER!!  Peer pressure my butt!!  LOL  <br><br>Yeah, this is more "playable" for the barbarian challenged of us, which is really the only reason to change the build!

If you scare an enemy, that's either -2 AB for them or they run off screaming if they're half your level or less.  -2 AB is still -20%ish damage to you in most cases.

Not to mention you misread my (incorrect) statement as well.  I said fear if they were half your HD or less, -2 AB otherwise.  The -2 AB effect only doesn't work if they're twice your level or more.

It appears that everyone have missed the effect of saves being reduced... I took a look at the terrifying rage script since it's 100% accurate than anything else.<br><br>This is the result. Hope it's clear.<br><br><ul><li>Below Barb HD - Paralyzed Effect.<br></li><li>Below Bard HD * 2 - AB <b>AND</b> Saving Throws(<b>ALL</b>) get decreased by 2.<br></li><li>Beyond that - Not affected by rage.<br></li></ul><br><br>So... basically paralysis affects everyone that is level 39 and below. AB and Saves loss affects everyone that is level 79 and below. Beyond 80, nothing happens when rage is in effect. This is based on level 40.<br><br>Oh, I forgot to mention the DC of the rage is supposed to be d20 + Ranks in Intimidate skill. So if you play by the correct rule, the terrifying rage DC would be 62 (with max roll)! And that's without any boosting item at level 40.<br><br>However, since BioWare changed it to d10, DC would be 52 (with max roll).<br><br>Regardless of the change... it's effective against many... considering that most don't have Will save in that neighborhood I believe.<br><br>So.. imagine if you were to find some item that gives you 50+ bonus to intimidate... I leave the rest to you to figure out... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">  <br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Anuis on 10/27/09 22:26</span></i></p>

Ok, I took another look in test mod and had combat debugging on. If I am reading it correctly, it appears that it does take sf:intimidate and esf:intimidate into account for DC as I have had several DC in excess of 60 while equipping fullplate, greataxe and nothing else.<br><br>So, the DC for terrifying rage would actually be 62(d20 at max roll) + 13 = 75 DC.
