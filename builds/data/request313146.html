Hello, <br><br>First time posting. Thank you for any help in advance.<br>First off id like to say the server I play on the majority of the mobs are have higher AC and AB in the upper areas.  The highest weapons you can get are +10s but the server also has a forging system which allows you to add stats ac etc.  Though armor you get isnt the highest AC you can get from others servers.  Enough rambling onto the topic at hand.  <br><br>I would like to create a charictor that has Epic dodge, SC 5 and a really good AB.  Id prefer a dual wield but would sacrifice the ability to in order to fufill the other prereqs Id like to have.  I was thinking of perhaps utilizing FE's to help boost my AB vs. other monsters.  <br><br>Again thank you for any help.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Luzaf on 10/24/09 03:04</span></i></p>

Are there any minimum levels per class or multiclassing restrictions in general?  And you're sure you want SV5 instead of just getting Improved Invisibility from a wand or something?

I came to the conclusion that SC 5 is better due to it working vs. true seing mobs such as boss's and im certain that most have. There are no class level restrictions.

Well, I wouldn't say SCV is useless because scrolls or wands of improved invisibility are easily dispellable, last for only so long, and have to be replaced constantly.  SCV is always active and unable to be dispelled.  And if some glitch is discovered in the not so distant future where concealment bonuses stack under certain conditions, then I wouldn't want to miss out on the ability to become mathematically impossible to hit with a small buff.<br>_________________<br>I smite thee with all of the power of Tempus!<br><br>(swings mace, hits, floating number six)<br><br>WAH?!?!? 6 DAMAGE?!?!?!

Yes, Imp Invis doesn't make SCV useless, but it does make it absolutely nowhere near worth the investment.  Let's see... permanent concealment for a huge stat investment (which you may be making anyways...), and <b>five</b> epic feats, vs. spending some gold on dispellable, perhaps not so long lasting  concealment.  Five epic feats, vs. gold...

And all that for a mere 25% concealment vs what counts (thanks to BF). A wand of Impr Invis grants a fast recast (wands activate faster than scroll or potions) in case of dispels and besides if wands are available one can use wand summons buffed with wand buffs to drain dispels from enemy critters (of course this won't work in PvP). Me, when I go for SCV I do it because I choose to for theme reasons, not because I consider it the optimal choice. The cost/benefit ratio ain't really good.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

Epic Toughness X (or V, for that matter) might be the only worse multi-epic feat investment I can think of.  I guess a fighter/RDD could take all GRT WIS, or something else ridiculous, but that's hardly the point.  Cost/benefit of SCV is ridiculous, though, I suppose it's better than the cost/benefit of SC I-IV...

And the thing about AC isn't as high as other servers is also not useful information.<br><br>I'd like to know why your requisites are "Epic Dodge and 50% Concealment", it's specific, which is a good thing in a request, but you can take Epic Dodge on your own and Improved Invisibility from items as stated, so there's not much else to work there. We could suggest builds from Sorcerer / Shadowdancer to Fighter / Weapon Master / Rogue, which are completely different builds to make and play. You want a meleer? Take Fighter in. A party guy? Take Cleric. A tank? take Pale Master. A caster? Take Sorcerer. An all-around build? Take Bard. A shifter? Take Druid. A ranger? Take Arcane Archer. Epic Dodge is not such a big restriction to narrow down builds. I know you said dual-wield in there, which means melee, but I don't think it's a well-thought request, dual-wield works fine for high AB builds or high critical range builds, so other than the Weapon Master one, I'd say dual-wield is not recommendable given you're already spending a bit in attaining Epic Dodge, so a lot of other choices should be considered.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

It's not about crits, it's not about high AB. No matter the AB, dual wielding (with all the feats) grants a higher damage output compared to single wielding and almost on par with a 2-hander in STR builds.

Hmmm... There is an error in the above.  Halflings can't finesse rapiers.  Therefore switch the weapon to mace, dagger, or kukri (exotic prof needed).

I like that idea! What level progression would you suggest to maximize feats and BAB?
