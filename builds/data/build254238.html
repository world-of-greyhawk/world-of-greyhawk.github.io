Monster-builds are popular nowadays <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>This split of classes is offensive overpower, and banned from many servers. You can wipe the floor with almost any other character with a B/F/RDD10 because of their extremly powerful offensive melee attributes. Their only weakness is AC, saves and defense against magic.<br>I have sacrificed some of this offensive overpower for defence, to make a more balanced character. Boosting all saves and HP.

Ending Strength looks like it should be 34, 16 Base +8 RDD +10 Level Ups.  I would probably go Bard 8 / RDD 8 / Ftr 4 pre epic to push a fighter bonus feat into epic without losing anything in AB.<br><br>I'd probably trade out a couple of feats and grab two great strengths in Epic to boost AB a little more.  26 Base + 13 Strength (36) +1 WF +1 EP + 2 EWF = 43 unbuffed.<br><br>Nice build overall!<br>_________________<br>In order to find his equal, an Irishman is forced to talk to<br>God.

Thx for correcting. STR is 34 but Con is 16. AB 42 and HP 464. I really dont agree trading 2 epic saves for 1AB/DAM in this killer is smart. AB/DAM is by my means more than enough anyway so I prefer better saves and epic taunt to not be roasted by mages. Mages and other B/F/RDD's are the only foes that really can challenge this guy.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By blixen71 on 10/01/06 01:38</span></i></p>

To Kail. The difference between this build and almost all other B/F/RDD's you referred to is that this one balances offence and defence, and is maximizing its defence and fighting against mages, since thats the biggest treat

After testing this build I wanted to further strengthen AC. This makes him better against typical melee builds with strong AB and limited AC. He can now raise AC to 60 while still having an AB potential about 50 (no magic items involved). I have dropped power attack and cleave for improved expertise.<br><br>I also tested it in PvP. He fell to devastating critical too often, so he is not recommended in dev crit environment. Other then that he did very well in any environment.<br><br>There where some typing errors in the initial post:<br>Starting ability stats: Str 16, Dex 10, Con 14, Wis 8, Int 14, Cha 14<br>Ending with: Str 34, Dex 10, Con 16, Wis 8, Int 16, Cha 16<br>Base AB is 42<br>Saves 31/27/24 +9 vs spell<br>Focus in Scimitar not Longsword

I would probably take lvls 19-21 as fighter and obtain EWS Longsword sooner.  No need to push so many fighter levels so late in life. Save lvl 40 as your fighter to max out disc.  This will also give you a better AB.
