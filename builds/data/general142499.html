I would like to build an Rouge Arcane Archer who can do HIPS.

I cannot become shadow dancer. I want to become a Rouge Acane Archer which Means I have a Rouge/Wizard/Arcane Archer levels. And I cannot take More than 3 classes. So I cannot take shadow dacer. so is there a way to use magic to suplement this?

Sorry, I wasn't reading clearly...<br><br>But you still can get shadowdancer if you drop the Rogue class. The advantages of taking shadowdancer instead of Rogue will give you more free feats, espcially Hide in Plain Sight, and taking that class will also give you free feats such as Slippery Mind, etc.<br><br>Anuis

If you really want to do HIPS and want AA, your gonna have to drop the rogue class. Use Bard with AA and SD. Go dex and get 10 levels of SD to get improved evasion. You should be able to get epic dodge.<br>_________________<br>"Computers are like air conditioners; They don't work when you open windows"

Thanks for the idea. I never thought about bard.<br><br>Is there any way by which I can get all 5 feats of self concealment? Can anybody suggest a possible build?<br><br>The one other reason I go for Rouge. It is to escape traps. How can a Bard/Arcane Archer/Shadow dancer do this?

With the low arcane archer levels the damage output won't be very spectacular. You'll have a character that is hard to hit, but anything with damage reductio will puts a big damper on your day.

Hi there Emril, actually its not that bad I equipped him with standartd hotu items. (robe of the shining hand +7, bracers of dex +10, strength belt +10, ring of elemental immunity, ring of protection +9, amulet of natural armour +7, boots of the sun soul +5. <br><br>He took out a Prismatic Dragon without relying on buffs or even summoning his shadow. He had 89 of his 228 hit points left.<br><br>I dont think that is doing too badly myself.<br><br>Syrath

Rather than going so heavy SD, you could go 12 Bard/10 SD/18 AA.  You would get a decent bard song (+2 ab/+2 ac/+3 dmg), lots of buff spells including imp inv for the 50% concealment, decent damage and good ab.  Self concealment really ISN'T worth the 5 feats.<br><br>Stats<br>str 10<br>dex 18<br>con 12<br>int 14<br>wis 8<br>chr 14<br><br>Lvling Order<br>8 Bard<br>10 AA<br>2 SD<br>8 AA<br>8 SD<br>4 Bard<br><br>Ending Stats<br>str 10<br>dex 34 (6 great dex feats)<br>con 12<br>int 14<br>wis 8<br>chr 14<br><br>With this you can 40 hide/move silently, disc, spellcraft, tumble, UMD and 18 perform (260)<br><br>This has better damage, ab, ac then getting self conceal 50%

For what its worth I agree, but the fact of the matter is I took him against a prismatic dragon and only took 140 damage total during the entire fight thanks to the way the build is made up. I dont think I could have said the same with more AA levels. However more AA would make a much better offensive character.<br><br>Syrath
