heyas;<br><br>  okay, up front, i suck at making 'power' builds.  so i build things that sound cool on paper, and... totally suck when i go to play them.  thus, why i'm here.  ;)<br><br>  i'm trying to build a mord-sith (if any of you know what that is).  basically, it's an evil mage-killer.  monk works well for me in this, for the sr, and also for the empty hand and kama focus, and light/no armor.  i also happen to think the assassin death attack (well, paralysis attack) is neato-keen.  when it works, which is very rarely (in my experience).<br><br><br>  now, what i would like is a monk/assassin mix, with at least 15 of monk.  actually, not over 20 of monk, because i hate flitting around like a spastic butterfly at monk speed, and also glowing eyes.  but this is a flexible limit.<br>   i only need single weapon (not dual wield), and kama focus.  i would like to do a strength build and get o-crit but not dev crit.  also, i would like disarm and improved disarm (and yeah, that's for rp, not power).<br><br><br>  with all that in mind, i have no idea what the best stats are, or class mix balance, or feat progression.  what do you guys think?  if you care to tinker with this idea, i'd love to see it :)<br>  thanks!

If you want your SR to be high enough to take out mages effectively, you have to focus on boosting SR so much it'll make the build - in my opinion - worthless. Using the spell Silence, however, is surprisingly efficient, as long as your opponents haven't got Autostill. It is extremely rare <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  With Monk speed you can keep the mages silenced inside the "aura" effect easily, and slice them to little pieces ^^<br>_________________<br>Now is my day's work done;<br>I'll take good breath:<br>Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of<br>blood and death.

heyas;<br><br>  well, i've heard that monk stunning fist is a lot better than assassin death attack, so...  now i'm thinking more like a monk/weapon master or monk/fighter/weaponmaster?  ah, i see there's a couple builds by amzard i could try  (killer search feature thing you guys have!)<br><br><br>  when i did 20 levels of monk, i got sr30.  since the max sr you can put on an item is... 32? when did it become 32??  well, anyway, since sr doesn't stack, i dont see how an sr of 30 is all that bad or worthless.  of course, i don't understand all this stat/build stuff, anyway! ;)

A character's spell penetration power is calculated as follows: d20 + caster level + feats. That means 30 SR is worthless against a decent level caster. Since the maximum caster level is 40, the maximum penetration power a caster can reach is 66. If you want to get impeccable SR, it'll eat up most of your feats and you'll have to be a high level Monk. It's just not worth it.<br>_________________<br>&lt; XmikeW&gt; im glad though.. i used to think that -all- finns were supersmart nerds.. but, after seeing 1) (C) law ..2) your culture minister ..and 3) the äm-irk girls... i can say that you guys are definately typical human beings after all [smile_:-)
