Was designing a pure bard build, but ended up going with 4 Blackguard for a more melee type build.<br><br>He turns out to have a pretty strong melee presence.<br><br>Things to consider:<br><br>--Might consider removing x2 great str feats to get toughness and Improved knockdown instead.  Might also consider a greatsword, halberd or great axe for large damage output.<br><br>--With eagles splendor and CHA items, your max cha is 34: divine shield/might can get up to +12.<br><br>--With stackable bull str (blackguard bull str stacks with your bard bull str) and a few items, it's fairly easy to get to STR 38.<br><br>--Weakness-Low HP!

Worth noting is that adding 2 fighter nets you one feat, Epic or whatever, without losing you anything. 4 fighter nets you two feats, without losing anything. 6 fighter also nets you two feats. I would do, for pure Bard, Bard 32/BG4/Fighter4. Actually, taken my favoring of BG's into account, I like this one. Nicely done, well planned, managing good use of CHA-based feats while keeping your melee presence competitive.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.
