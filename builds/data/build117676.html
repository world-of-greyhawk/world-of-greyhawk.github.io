I posted the bare bones of this build some time back.

Win initiative, hit and run. High dex also aids in using ranged weapons, so it is possible to attack using a bow and run away since it is impossible for anyone else to catch up.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 16:53</span></i></p>

Interesting, except for the alignment problem.  It's a lot harder to become lawful, and you have to change alignments 2x for this build.
