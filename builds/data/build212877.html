It hadn't been easy. Karrick Fellbeard was outcast and ridiculed. The Clanfathers thought him slightly mad. Even his parents and siblings had their doubts; he could see it in their troubled expressions,the pitying looks when they thought he wouldn't notice.<br><br>"Why does a Guardian of the Forge need to consort with the Eldritch Masters?" they'd ask. He shrugged and said nothing.<br><br>Despite that, he persevered, training daily in the Battle Halls, and studying with the mages at night. Days passed with sore muscles, bruises, and stitches reminding him of the day's battle training as he strained his eyes over dusty tomes and parchments by the light of a smoky, guttering candle at night. The days turned to weeks, and the weeks to months.<br><br>Still the Clanfathers muttered into their beards of the 'Mad Guardian' and the other Dwarves shook their heads or shared a jest over an ale at his expense. "Spellbeard", they called him. He bore it all in silence.<br><br>And then the day came when a call to arms echoed down the stone corridors and reverberated through the meeting halls. Attack!<br><br>It had been an uneasy truce and now it was war. Rumors had been heard of an alliance between the rival clans and the foul creatures of the dark, and now they were proven true. Dark elves and Dwarves in an unprecedented alliance, and now assaulting the Clanhold.<br><br>He donned his armor as quickly as he was able, grabbed his shield and took up his battleaxe. Before heading out into the confusion of the halls, he began chanting incantations. He could feel power coursing into him, his body energized. He turned his attention to his axe, chanting arcane spells, and caressing its edge. Soon the blade shone like the full moon and fire ran along its rim.<br><br>A passing Guardsman noticed him and turned, shouting "By the Gods, what be ye doing, lad? Get yerself out here and help. There be battle!" then rushed off down the corridor, chewing curses.<br><br>He was prepared. He followed the Guardsman, but something made him pause. An intuition perhaps, or a flash of inspiration. In an instant, he turned and went the other way, making for the mines. He knew, he <i>knew</i> they'd be coming that way. This frontal assault had no hope of success. He knew it was a feint.<br><br>The main tunnel was wide, but the doors were thick stone and solid. They were barricaded. No worries about invasion this way. But there was a narrow side tunnel,used now for storage and ventilation, but seldom travelled. He stopped, listening. Yes! He could hear them coming.<br><br>Abruptly, they were there. Dwarves and Drow, a small group of them. They stopped short, surprised. In that moment of hesitation, he bagan to move his hands, chanting an incantation. In seconds his body was encased in an acidic mist. <br><br>The leading Elf let out a low chuckle. "Well look, a lone Dwarf. It appears you've no friends, Dwarf. A pity. There'll be none to mourn you."<br><br>He set his feet, grinned, and said, "Ye'll pass through here when ye learn to eat stone, drow. Come ahead and let me axe taste yer blood. She's sharp, hot, and thirsty."<br><br>The Elf let out a shout and the group charged. Blades flashed, blood flowed, screams resounded through the passage. Incantations and spells were cast, but still he stood as if rooted to the stone.<br><br>Eventually, the Guardsmen found him. The bodies were piled high, almost choking the small passage. He stood among the them, covered in blood, a vision of death itself. At the shocked looks on the Guardsmen's faces, he laughed, exhausted. "Hah, don't look so worried. Most of it ain't mine", he said.<br><br>In the years that followed, the legend of Karrick Fellbeard grew. Rumor had it he'd singlehandedly taken on an entire Drow army and his axe could cut through stone like rotten fruit. Whatever the truth of it was, none disputed he'd saved the Clanhold and the word 'Spellbeard' soon became a term of respect.<br><br><br><br>I was actually very surprised to see there isn't a single posted build with this class combination. Granted, I've not played it, but it looks like it would pretty darned effective to me.

The immunity to Death Magic and negative effects is damned nice. However, an ammy of Health has the same effect (if you can get it).

And you have Grtr Stoneskin as an option if your opponents can't bypass the +5 DR limit. Couple that with your DwD DR and you'll take very little damage.<br><br>GMW is in the same boat: unless the environment is extremely low magic, you'll probably have a +5 weapon anyway.<br><br>Mind Blank can be compensated for with PfE/PfG, Clarity, and Lesser Mind Blank (granted they're all single target, but when you're adventuring in a party, you prepare your spellbook accordingly).<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Plus with 12 wiz levels the durations on your spells is very short, especially for damage shields, which you'll probably want to use a lot with this guy.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Durations are fine for hour/level and turn/level spells. For the round/level spells, that's why you have your Concentration maxed: to recast them in battles (although 12 rounds is generally long enough to get you to the endgame of most battles). And your short duration shields are things like Lesser Spell Mantle and Globes vs casters (and you're not going to get into a spell-slinging contest with them, you're going to go after their butts). For battles vs melee opponents, you're using the reciprocal damage spells. 12 rounds is plenty if they're actually beating on you.<br><br>As I said, you could definitely go other ways with the spellsword template. However the point behind this build was a DwD that had some spells to help him out. Having more WIZ levels than DwD levels wouldn't fit the vision.<br><br>Thanks for the input, though. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 09/16/05 19:24</span></i></p>

This build is totally sweet!  But I think you missed a feat.  At level 9 it looks like you took fighter level 6 and lightning reflexes as your general level 9 feat, wouldn't you also have a fighter bonuses feat at this level?

Nice build with a nice balance between offense, defense, and support magic.  I support the level split as-is, it just "clicks."  I think this build's best spells would be the return-damage shields, with that hefty dose of DR your enemies could easily kill themselves by attacking you ineffectively.<br><br>You have a talent for making creative, versatile and effective builds, Cinn, and you're on a roll lately.
