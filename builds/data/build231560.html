I just like to make Monks multiclassed, and since my other melee only monk had a crappy resistance and HP ( <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "229716", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>this</a> ), I decided to make another one that could resist a lot, hence, Dwarven Defender. Monk Stance as in Defensive Stance, I think I wasn't very creative at the time.<br><br>Alignment: Any lawful<br><br>Race: Obviuosly Dwarf<br><br>Playable Levels: 1-40<br>PvM, untested PvP<br><br>Status:<br><br>Str 16 (26)<br>Dex 14 (16)<br>Con 18 (22)<br>Wis 10<br>Int 10<br>Cha 6<br><br>Feats:<br><br>1 Monk - Thoughness<br>2 Monk<br>3 Monk - Weapon Focus: kama<br>4 Monk - DEX +1 (15)<br>5 Monk<br>6 Monk - Dodge<br>7 Monk<br>8 Monk - DEX +1 (16)<br>9 Monk - Ambidexterity<br>10 Monk - [Tumble 13]<br>11 Dwarven Defender<br>12 Dwarven Defender - CON +1 (19), Two Wapon Fighting<br>13 Dwarven Defender<br>14 Dwarven Defender<br>15 Dwarven Defender - Improved Two Weapon Fighting<br>16 Dwarven Defender - CON +1 (20)<br>17 Dwarven Defender<br>18 Dwarven Defender - Improved Critical: kama<br>19 Dwarven Defender<br>20 Dwarven Defender - CON +1 (21)<br>21 Dwarven Defender - Epic Weapon Focus<br>22 Dwarven Defender<br>23 Dwarven Defender<br>24 Dwarven Defender - CON +1 (22), Great Strength I (17), Epic Damage Reduction I<br>25 Dwarven Defender<br>26 Dwarven Defender<br>27 Dwarven Defender - Great Strength II (18)<br>28 Dwarven Defender - STR +1 (19), Epic Damage Reduction II<br>29 Dwarven Defender<br>30 Dwarven Defender - Great Strength III (20)<br>31 Dwarven Defender<br>32 Dwarven Defender - STR +1 (21), Epic Damage Reduction III<br>33 Dwarven Defender - Great Strength IV (22)<br>34 Dwarven Defender<br>35 Dwarven Defender<br>36 Dwarven Defender - STR +1 (23), Great Strength V (24), Epic Prowess<br>37 Dwarven Defender<br>38 Dwarven Defender<br>39 Dwarven Defender - Great Strength VI (25)<br>40 Dwarven Defender - STR +1 (26), Armor Skin<br><br>Maked HP: 720 (800 while in Defensive Stance)<br><br>Skills:<br>Discipline 43<br>Heal 42<br>Tumble 20<br><br>Saving Throws (with defensive stance):<br>Fortitude 30 (34)<br>Reflex 23 (25)<br>Will 24 (26)<br><br>Naked AC: 21 (25 with defensive stance)<br><br>AB with two normal kamas<br>Mainhand: +37/+34//+31/+28/+25/+22<br>Offhand: +37/+34<br><br>Advantages: Damage reduction 30/-, Improved Evasion, high HP<br><br>Disadvantages: Low AB, low AC, low saves<br><br>In fact I chose to take Dwarven Defender Damage Reduction to max instead of maxing Tumble for another 4 AC, and I think it's actually better to resist, as my AC won't be very high at any rate.<br><br>Improvements are well welcome.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/23/06 22:50</span></i></p>

Can't you put monk 10 at 17 so as to put Tumble to 20 at least rather than 13?<br><br>-DaMouse

No, he needs to have a BAB of 7 to start taking DwD levels. He could do it if he took a few fighter levels.<br><br>This would actually be my suggestion - go Monk 4/Fighter 4 first, and pick up WS: kama. Then you can start taking DwD levels at level 9, and take monk levels at 13 and 17 to bump tumble. This would end at Monk 6/Fighter 4/DwD 30. It also picks up another point of AB that way. <br><br>If you are willing to lose 3 off your damage reduction, you might want to consider 2 more fighter levels in Epic and 2 more monk levels as well. Let's you bump tumble a few more times and pick up EWS: kama.<br><br>TM

What he said. If you give up only 3 DR, you can get EWS, 4 more AC and +1 BAB/AB. 4 AC is better than 3 DR anyday, ESPECIALLY since AC is low anyhow, which you claim yourself. Even monk 14/DD26 would be better, netting you that crucial extra points in AC. My experience tells me that the DR 27/- builds beats DR 30/- builds anyday, since you have the possibility of gaining so much for those last three DR.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Say, Monk 5/Fighter5 pre-epic, ending the build Monk 6/Fighter8/DwD26. You would not loose a feat. You would gain 2 feats pre-epic PLUS WS. Blind fight is a must for Melee's. In Epic Fighter lvl 6 gain you what the DD lost, and Fighter 8 gives a bonus(EWS). This would postpone IKD until very late, but is it that necessary to have in a non sneak-attacker. Yeah, it's nice, but not that necesary. You might gain an AB by going Monk6/Fighter4 pre-epic, and have 2 fighter(which covers the DDfeat) and 2 monk for tumble AC boost. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Hmmmm.... non epic fighter in epic levels can use AS, EP and EDR as class feat, I didn't know that, well, that does make up for the DD bonus feat, so my AB will increase by 1, but I'll lose Improved Evasion and get IKD up to level 37 to get 40 tumble......<br><br>IE will make me lose a feat, and that maks me lose AB, so I'll keep your idea, but I'll go ppre-epic fighter 6 / monk 4, so that I have 2 levels in epic to increase tumble, and have my AC as high as possible in mid levels.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/25/06 19:02</span></i></p>
