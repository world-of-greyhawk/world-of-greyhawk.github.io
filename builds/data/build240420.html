<b>Playable from level 1 to 40... PvM</b><br><br>Here's a really wierd character, I set out to make a tank with stealth abilities, though in retrospect a tank is supposed to be conspicuous and draw fire from other team members.  None the less here it is, an armored warrior with a good AB, lots of hitpoints, an okay AC (the AB is high enough that it could use expertise, and still remain effective) and 9 points of damage reduction.  On top of that it has pretty good Hide and Move silently skills (just don't use a tower shield while sneaking), HiPS and an intiative high enough that he can use the hide-attack-hide tactic successfully.  On the downside, it only has physical attacks so only one mode of attack and the saves aren't stellar so spellcasters will walk all over him.  Still, I think this character would do well in a mid to high magic setting where true seeing and devastating critical are banned.  I'm not really sure what to say about him other than that, I'll let the community judge him.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br>-High AB.  Lower that one would expect with 25 WM levels, but higher than most characters.<br>-17-20 threat range with an X4 multiplier bludgeoning weapon.  Bludgeoning Damage is rarely resisted, and those X4 crits hurt. <br>-High Hitpoints and 9 points of damage reduction.  He can take quite the physical beating.  <br>-Hide in Plain Sight.  His Hide and Move Silently totals are pretty good too.<br>-Evasion.  His reflex save is mediocre, but this will cut down some of the damage.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br><br>-Mediocre Saves.  The Will save is downright pathetic.  The others are okay, and with the boost one would expect in a +5 to +10 item setting he should make those saves.  Spellcasters are still going to kick his butt. <br>-Only one mode of attack.  If he can't kill with his hammer all he can do is sit there and take damage.<br><br><b>Silent Knight</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Human<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 16<br>DEX 14<br>CON 15<br>INT 14 <br>WIS 8<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Fighter 12<br>Shadowdancer 3<br>Weapon Master 25<br><br><i>Attribute bonuses</i><br>Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 32, 36 and 40 increase STR<br>Levels 20, 24 and 28 increase CON<br><br><i>Level Distribution and Feats</i><br>Level 1: (Fighter 1): Dodge, Toughness, Weapon Focus (Warhammer)<br>Level 2: (Fighter 2): Expertise<br>Level 3: (Fighter 3): Mobility<br>Level 4: (Fighter 4): Weapon Specialization (Warhammer)<br>Level 5: (Fighter 5)<br>Level 6: (Fighter 6): Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack<br>Level 7: (Fighter 7)<br>Level 8: (Fighter 8 ) : Knockdown<br>Level 9: (Fighter 9): Improved Initiative<br>Level 10: (Fighter 10): Improved Critical (Warhammer)<br>Level 11: (Weapon Master 1)<br>Level 12: (Weapon Master 2): Improved Knockdown<br>Level 13: (Weapon Master 3)<br>Level 14: (Weapon Master 4)<br>Level 15: (Weapon Master 5): Blind-Fight<br>Level 16: (Weapon Master 6)<br>Level 17: (Weapon Master 7)<br>Level 18: (Weapon Master 8 ) : Stealthy<br>Level 19: (Weapon Master 9)<br>Level 20: (Weapon Master 10)<br>Level 21: (Weapon Master 11): Great Constitution I<br>Level 22: (Weapon Master 12)<br>Level 23: (Weapon Master 13): Epic Weapon Focus (Warhammer)<br>Level 24: (Weapon Master 14): Great Constitution II<br>Level 25: (Weapon Master 15)<br>Level 26: (Weapon Master 16): Epic Prowess<br>Level 27: (Shadowdancer 1): Great Constitution III<br>Level 28: (Fighter 11)<br>Level 29: (Fighter 12): Epic Weapon Specialization (Warhammer) <br>Level 30: (Weapon Master 17): Epic Skill Focus (Hide)<br>Level 31: (Weapon Master 18)<br>Level 32: (Weapon Master 19): Epic Damage Reduction I<br>Level 33: (Shadowdancer 2): Epic Skill Focus (Move Silently)<br>Level 34: (Weapon Master 20)<br>Level 35: (Weapon Master 21)<br>Level 36: (Weapon Master 22): Epic Damage Reduction II, Epic Damage Reduction III<br>Level 37: (Weapon Master 23)<br>Level 38: (Weapon Master 24)<br>Level 39: (Weapon Master 25): Great Strength I, Superior Initiative<br>Level 40: (Shadowdancer 3)<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 24<br>DEX 14<br>CON 21<br>INT 14 <br>WIS 8<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>AB and Damage</i><br>(Regular Warhammer, No Buffs)<br>47/42/37/32 13+1D8 (17-20 x4)<br><br>(+5 Warhammer, +12 to STR[belt+gauntlets+potion], Boots of Haste)<br>58/53/48/43/58 24+1D8 (17-20 x4)<br><br><i>AC</i> <br>20 (No buffs, no armor)<br>27 (No buffs, mundane full plate)<br>30 (No buffs, mundane full plate and tower shield)<br>54 (No buffs, +5 full plate, +5 tower shield, Boots of Haste, +5 ring of protection, +5 Amulet of Natural Armor)<br><br><i>Damage Reduction</i> 9 points<br><br><i>Hit Points</i> 634 (Max.

If you go dwarf, you'll gain advantages. Keeping the ability distribution the same (before racial modifiers) with dwarf frees up two epic feats (with which you can keep toughness and gets you Armor Skin).<br>_________________<br>CATS!

I originally thought about going dwarf but, because of the skill requirements of the build, I decided to go human for the extra skill points.  You could go dwarf, but you would have to find a way shave off 43 skill points.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

I'm a fan of skills too, I suppose by weakening your stealth skills and eliminating spellcraft you can manage the dwarf change... but weakening your stealth skills is kind of contrary to the purpose of this build, from what I gather.<br><br>Interesting concept, and a good execution.  It can be very useful for a front liner to be able to sneak around.  A character like this can sneak up to the enemy, close in on any spellcasters easily, and just attack them before they have a chance to buff or cast many ugly offensive spells. <br><br>The "heavy scout" also comes in handy on teams, since your scout is a tank, your party can move faster and doesn't need to give the scout as much room.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
