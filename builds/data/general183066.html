Can anyone recommed a good pw server? The server I play on now is a good one, lots of dm's and cool areas but there are too many uber items. Because of all the high end weapons and armor available to everyone, even at lower levels, certain classes, such as paladins and monks, really suffer. I guess I like action more than rp though a little rp would be great but I've noticed there are a lot of restrictions on how you can build a character on an rp server and I really hate restrictions on resting. I dont' see the point in that, yes it makes more challenging but not necessarily more fun. I would greatly appreciate any suggestions. Thank you.

Valley of Shrouds is a very good one, the toughness of the server makes for some extremely extreme action.  No uber items, party-play is a must.

You might try Realm of the Lost Legion.  It's listed under the RP section.  Lot's of areas and stuff to do.  RP is optional, so there's less restrictions.  You can solo most areas and the guild site is especially active.  I've played there off and on since early 2003 and I really enjoy it.<br>_________________<br>"Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work."<br>--C.F.

Hmmmm i play on a server under the RP section too Called Lands of Valanther its a twist on the 3rd addition rules has a really good a different take on magic weapons and equipment.. Were trying to make it more roleplay based but you can solo alot of the early areas and new epic areas are being added the Guild is Called The Adventures Domain for Roleplay..... It also has some rules about class's and you have to have a minimum of 5 levels in each class u take which makes you think more about your characters life and future journey

For Shadowdancers there are 3 levels of Rogue prereq. All so-called "nerfs" are brought for one reason, to improve balance. New Class improvements are on way. "Balance" on 3 Towns does not means, that you will be able as Harper Scout to have 50/50 outcome in PvP, sure Casters will wipe you out, but it means that Rangers, Bards, etc will get in future same opportunities to survive in world as traditionally strong Clerics, Sorcerers, etc. Documentations and similar are more and more available, but many things are well described in Forums.<br>_________________<br>The Three Towns - a Neverwinter Nights persistent world.<br>Oby<br>DM Team<br><a href="http://www.threetowns.org.uk" target="_blank">www.threetowns.org.uk</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Obyvatel on 03/04/05 11:06</span></i></p>
