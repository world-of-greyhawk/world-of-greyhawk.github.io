I present to you: <b>The Fallen Angel</b><br><br>This is not typically a RP build, but more a powerbuild.  It requires an alignment shift, and it is not too easy to level up from 1-20.  But, there are no Paladin Monk Assassins listed in the build index, so I thought I'd add one. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br>Elf, Lawful Good<br>PvM 21-40<br>PvP 21-40<br><br>20 DEX (34)<br>14 WIS<br>14 INT<br>8 CON<br>8 CHA<br>8 STR<br><br>1 Pal 1: Weapon Finesse<br>2 Pal 2<br>3 Pal 3: Weapon Focus: Unarmed Strike<br>4 Pal 4: DEX +1 (DEX=21)<br>5 Pal 5<br>6 Pal 6: Blind Fight<br>7 Pal 7<br>8 Pal 8: DEX +1 (DEX=22)<br>9 Pal 9: Extend Spell<br>10 Pal 10<br>11 Pal 11<br>12 Pal 12: DEX +1, Toughness (DEX=23)<br>13 Pal 13<br>14 Pal 14<br>15 Pal 15 Great Fortitude<br>16 Pal 16 DEX +1 (DEX=24)<br>17 Pal 17<br>18 Pal 18: Improved Criticals: Unarmed Strike<br>19 Pal 19<br>20 Pal 20 DEX +1 (DEX=25)<br>21 Monk 1: Epic Weapon Focus: Unarmed Strike<br>22 Monk 2: <br>23 Monk 3:<br>24 Monk 4: DEX +1, Armor Skin (DEX=26)<br>25 Monk 5:<br>26 Monk 6: &lt;Knockdown, Improved Knockdown&gt;, 8 points Hide/Move Silently, alignment shift Lawful Evil<br>27 Assassin 1: Epic Prowess<br>28 Monk 7: DEX +1 (DEX=27)<br>29 Monk 8:<br>30 Monk 9: Great DEX I, (DEX=28)<br>31 Monk 10: <br>32 Monk 11: DEX +1 (DEX=29)<br>33 Monk 12: Great DEX II, (DEX=30)<br>34 Monk 13: <br>35 Monk 14:<br>36 Monk 15: DEX +1, Great DEX III, (DEX=32)<br>37 Monk 16:<br>38 Monk 17:<br>39 Assassin 2: Great DEX IV, (DEX=33)<br>40 Monk 18: DEX +1, &lt;Empty Body&gt;, (DEX=34)<br><br><b>VITALS</b><br><br><i>Attack Bonus</i><br>Naked, unarmed:<br>+46/43/40/37/34/31<br>Self-buffed, with maxed Dexterity (+12 from gear):<br>+60/57/54/51/48/45<br> --- Can be much higher with True Strike scrolls, or with AB enhanced Monk gloves<br>Max AB possible:<br>+72/69/66/63/60/57<br> --- A potential +1 attack per round with haste (UMD)<br><br><br><i>Armor Class</i><br>Naked, mundane robes:<br>37 AC<br>Wearing +5 gear, hasted (UMD), and +12 DEX/WIS gear:<br><b>73</b> AC<br><br><br><i>Saving Throws</i><br>Fortitude 23<br>Reflex 28<br>Will 18<br> --- A potential +12 to each category by maxing CHA and the appropriate stat (WIS/DEX/CON)<br><br><br><i>Hit Points</i><br>356 max, +240 from +12 CON gear<br><br><br><i>Skill Points</i><br>212 total; <br>43 Discipline<br>33 Hide<br>32 Move Silently<br>43 Spot<br>40 Tumble<br>21 UMD<br><br><br><i>Pros</i><br>Very high AB for an unarmed monk<br>Moderately high AC for an unarmed monk<br>Uncanny Dodge<br>High spot<br>UMD<br>Moderately high HPs for an unarmed monk<br>Paladin saves<br>Good non-sneak damage (1d20 fists, Paladin damage)<br><br><br><i>Cons</i><br>Gimped Hide/Move Silently<br>Low sneak damage<br>Average discipline<br>No Epic Dodge<br><br><br><i>Notes</i><br>It was a tough choice between Shadowdancer and Assassin, but eventually I decided I'd rather UMD, Empty Body, two pre-epic feats, and the additional 1d8 fist damage than Epic Dodge.  Also, I was torn between dropping two Great DEX for ESF: Discipline and ESF: Spot (or Epic Fortitude if you're that scared of Devastating Criticals).  That is definitely a viable option, but the main focus of this build was to achieve a very high unarmed AB.  And remember, this was made for a medium magic world where it is possible to max three to four stat categories, and attain moderately high AC.  It is not typically made to be leveled from 1-40, but I think it <i>is</i> possible for some players - just slap on a club and shield, and use your Paladin buffs to hunt some undead until level 21.<br><br>--mantis3<br><br><i>Edit: Doh, forgot to post saves.</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/10/07 14:27</span></i></p>

I can see why you'd say it's tough to level up to level 20, with a negative STR modifier, an 8 CON, and no real damage sources until you start grabbing some spells. In fact, I'd put the low HPs under the Cons section, as well as the XP penalty you'll be getting from level 21 onward.<br><br>As for the build itself, it's an interesting concept, but I'd really be tempted to start with 18 DEX and put the 6 points of savings into STR and/or CON.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

That's definitely a viable option.  In fact, if you were to level from 1-40 manually, it would probably be a better idea.<br><br>Which would mean you could go human, gain 40 skill points and toughness as a feat, and also lose the XP penalty. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">
