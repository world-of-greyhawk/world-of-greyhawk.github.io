Following the game booklet's advice I aimed for 15 levels of barbarian to catch mighty rage and then race WM levels to raise with Epic Superior Weapon Focus, grabbing a couple CoT levels along the line for needed bonus feats. I must admit I was surprised that mighty rage did not show up when I hit barbarian 15 in epic levels. A quick search in the forums revealed the need for Epic Barbarian... I scrapped the build and started over. I left behind the idea of a weapon master and decided to put the focus on barbarian and CoT to get the most DR and saves with Mighty Rage, hitting only 7 levels of WM to raise my critical range and multiplier. <br><br>The results are satisfying IMO. A meleer with high HP, 14/- DR and the ability to go over the + 12 cap for Strength and Constitution without spells or magic items. He also has a decent damage output with his high critical range (18-20x4) and the ability to use Ki Damage 7X per day, as well as high Fortitude and Reflex saves. With a successful taunt (at + 41), he can also get a net bonus of + 6 to his AB, for a maximum unbuffed AB of + 54.<br><br>However, he has his weaknesses. His unbuffed Will save can cause trouble. He'll be very vulnerable against mind-affecting spells if there's no clarity potions available. When raging though, it gets a little better, and there's the racial bonus to take into account too. And his AC with mundane gear isn't that good either, although<br>the damage reduction feats and high HP can make up for it. Against concealed opponents, he'll be in trouble since he doesn't get Blind-Fight. You could get it at the expense of another feat though.<br><br>All in all I consider him a good barbarian build that can stand his own without much trouble.<br><br>Comments and suggestions are much welcome!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 12/02/05 23:03</span></i></p>

Suggestion: fit in Terrifying Rage which you can get at Barb level 15. Mucho squat yet scary barbarian &gt;:) but maybe not all that useful <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

It is a powerful melee'r, DR and all. Even your saves are quite good to very good. In a low magic world Barbarians truly shine, they can be useful in mid magic, and do something else in high magic world.<br>I like this one, CoT nicely covers up a few Barbarian weaknesses, like saves and feat starvation.<br>Very well, Saosin.

I myself would never, ever play a meleer without Blind-Fight (unless it's <b>impossible</b> to fit in). But I guess if you don't come across any concealed opponents in your environment, it's fine. In my opinion, Bling-Fight is more useful than IKD - IKD is just bonus (small creatures may need it, however).<br><br>Nevertheless it's a fine build.<br><br>EDIT: oh you mentioned Blind-Fight already <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  Well, I'd suggest dropping IKD ;D<br>_________________<br>Now is my day's work done;<br>I'll take good breath:<br>Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of<br>blood and death.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 11/15/05 13:39</span></i></p>
