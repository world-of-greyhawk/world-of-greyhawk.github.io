This is my first build posted, open to criticism and comments.<br>I tried to make a “hard-to-hit” character, while able to deliver devastating critical. Here it is.<br><br>Rogue/Bard/RDD (29/1/10)<br>Elf (necessary)<br>Chaotic X (necessary for bard)<br><br>16 --&gt; 25<br>20 --&gt; 32<br>10 --&gt; 12<br>8 --&gt; 10<br>8 --&gt; 8<br>8 --&gt; 10<br><br>1: dodge<br>3: finesse<br>4: +1 dex<br>5: bard (useful for shield since this character does not have the available feats for dual-wielding; and keep some skill points from rogue to invest in spellcraft (I put 10 in total for saving throws bonus) and discipline)<br>6: RDD/ Weapon Focus (rapier)<br>8: +1 dex<br>9: Power Attack<br>12: +1 dex/ improve critical (rapier)<br>15: cleave<br>16: +1 dex<br>18: great cleave<br>20 +1 in strength (important for crits feats)<br>21: overwhelming critical/ defensive roll<br>24: +1 dex/ devastating critical/ improve invasion<br>27: Great dex/ epic dodge<br>28: +1 dex<br>30: great dex/ opportunist (or any other rogue feat)<br>32: +1 dex<br>33: great dex<br>35: self-concealment<br>36: +1 dex / self-concealment<br>39: self-concealment/ self-concealment<br>40: +1 dex<br><br>So this character finished with 40% of concealment, Epic Dodge, devastating critical, and a naked AC of 33 with good sneak attacks. I maxed out move silently, tumble, open lock. Almost maxed out were hide and UMD. I also invested in discipline and spellcraft (as mentioned above).<br>Versatile and fun character to play, especially online where you can easily buy high-level spells (from stores or other players).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 17:18</span></i></p>
