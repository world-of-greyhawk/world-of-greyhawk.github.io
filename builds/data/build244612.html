Playable PvM/Single Player, and PvP where all good villains are generally welcome (note: may want to check with your DMs/Host, in the event of alignment issue). <br><br><br>“Not necessity, not desire - no, the love of power is the demon of men. Let them have everything - health, food, a place to live, entertainment - they are and remain unhappy and low-spirited: for the demon waits and waits and will be satisfied.” ~ Friedrich Nietzsche<br><br><br>             Blood Knight (Order Baphomet)<br>             By Deborah Tyr<br><br><br>In a companion build entitled: the Knight Templar, we look at the history and mythos of the legendary monk-soldiers, from their humble origins and meteoric rise to power, to their tragic end. Templars were a Christian military Order, and conducted much of their affairs in secret. Information allegedly came to the attention of the Pope and King of France suggesting that Templars, or at least some of them, were guilty of heinous crimes and unholy practices, including idol worship in the form of a ram’s skull; this skull is now synonymous with the Demon Baphomet, being one of Hell’s major rulers.  <br><br>While the Templar leader and a few others were burned at the stake for demon worship, many others were either found innocent and released, or not even charged at all. Still a great many others escaped, about which there is and continues to be much speculation. Some say that the Templars went on to join or form other military orders, such as the Teutonic Knights in Austria-Germany. Others claim some Templars formed yet another secret society known as the Freemasons, which is so secret and powerful that it is itself steeped in controversy. Yet others, predominantly conspiracy theorists, believe the most fantastic and fictional of claims, which suggests that the Templars were in fact guilty, if not of the crimes charged, then of protecting secrets for the Church and keeping the world’s biggest lie from the public; it is this that forms the Hollywood picture, the Davinci Code. <br><br>In this build, which is the second of what will be a three-part series, we explore the position of the King and Pope, assuming (without answering the question) that there were at least some Templars, perhaps deeply embedded within and themselves a secret, who were guilty as charged. In other words, this character is an unholy knight, the Blood Knight of the Baphomet Order, a sword-wielding and high ranking monk-soldier who started out proper but, somewhere along the way, having tasted both wealth and power, was seduced by Baphomet; in time, the Blood Knight would crave nothing short of total world domination, in league with the unholy lord. <br><br>If such accusations against the Templars be true, then an alarming question must be further answered: what if there are others, members who either went underground or otherwise managed to avoid trial, who are also in league with the demon. Unholy Blood Knights who thus be out there, somewhere, hell bent and still determined on total world domination for unspeakable ends? <br><br><br>The Blood Knight (Order Baphomet)<br>Monk(9), Paladin(15), Blackguard(16)<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Lawful Good (Starting) / Lawful Evil (Ending)<br>Hitpoints: 462<br><br>FINAL STATS:<br>STR: 14 (24)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 14 (20)<br><br>Saving Throws:<br>Fort: 	39 (41) Protection) (+5 Dark Blessing)*<br>Will:  	30 (32) Protection) (+5 Dark Blessing)*<br>Reflex: 27 (29 Protection)   (+5 Dark Blessing)*<br><br>*Dark Blessing: +9 with Eagle’s, Aura of Glory<br><br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4, Mind Effects: +2<br>Immunities: Disease, Fear, Mind-Effects (Protection)<br><br><br><br>COMBAT VITALS:<br>BAB: 29, <br>AB +40 (no buffs), AB +47 (Bull’s, GMW Only), AB +54-Plus (Divine/Dark Buffs Only, No Equipment) <br><br>Other Considerations (not factored/included in calculation): <br>Improved Knockdown, Taunt, &amp; Smiting AB Bonus* <br><br><br>Damage (using mundane long sword, illustrative only)<br>1d8 + (*STR Mod.), <br>+25-Plus Divine Might, Paladin Spells &amp; BG Buffs<br>+15/16 Sonic (Smite Good/Evil Damage Bonus)* <br><br>Other Damage:<br>•	BG Sneak Attack: 5d6 damage<br>•	Lay-on-Hands (Positive Energy Damage): *9x15 (or, 135 total)<br>•	BG Inflict Serious Wounds: 3d8 +15<br>•	Contagion: target randomly struck with one of the following debilitating diseases: Blinding Sickness, Cackle Fever, Mind Fire, Red Ache, Shakes, or Slimy Doom.<br><br><br><br><br>DEFENSE VITALS:<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 22/30<br>+2 Protection from Alignment<br>+9 Divine Shield (+5 Cha.

Author's Note: This build, the Blood Knight (Order Baphoment) was inspired by Avado, whose thoughtful musings on the companion build led to my exploring what a Templar who had truly fallen from grace, as in evil, might look like. It also speaks to some wonderful thoughts I received from Grim, Xylo, Cats and others, whose musings as to "more paladin" are explored in this build. A third and final character will be added to the series, which will  be evem nore Paladin-based than is this one. While the first, which is a divine warrior + bard build awaits just a few minor tweaks (being that fine layer of polish this guild is just so famous for <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   this one, the Blood Knight, a fallen soldier-monk per se, looks forward, as always, to your thoughtful comments. <br><br>~ Deb Tyr<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/21/06 06:21</span></i></p>

I like the idea behind this character. I also like the historical context of your build and the way you link it to a series of other builds here. I already look forward to your next one. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>One thing is a bit unclear though. You list Longsword as weapon for "illustrative" purposes. You also list AC in "armor" and with a "shield".<br>Is the character supposed to be played with Full Plate and Tower? <br>The use of the monk class is obvious for RP or theme reasons. I guess that's why you also take one level pre epic, even though the better saves comes at the price of +1AB. Build tecnically monk gives several free feats, and access to class skills. It also gives Monk AC, speed and attack table if you use monk gear. Is Robes and Kama meant to be an option?<br><br>It is not clear to me why you take 41 ranks in Hide.<br>When you take Discipline, I suggest you max it so it has a chance to do something for you.<br><br>Finally a minor (but positive) one: Eagle's and Aura stack. Your buffed Charisma is between 26 and 29. Your buffed Cha modifier becomes +8 or +9.<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 06/21/06 08:42</span></i></p>

Hi, Mick. Appreciate you dropping by.<br><br>Firstly, as to the Cha bonus (divine stuff and dark), EGADS, you're right .. it SHOULD READ +9 and not +7 when fully buffed; that is, +9 to AC (Divine Shield), +9 to damage (Divine Might), +9 to Saves (Dark Blessing), and 9x15 positive energy/lay-on-hands damage - thank you so much for catching it and bringing that up (and I do sincerely apologize to everyone for that; please take note of that folks (and thank you, Mick!). <br><br>I'm glad you like this character; for me, it's about the stories and, it seems, the history, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   So wonderful to hear. As to those great questions:<br><br>Monk. I took monk for all those great free feats of theirs, including speed, and began the journey pre-epic as to get cleave early when it is most beneficial. Also, there's that stunning fist which, with a wis 14, comes with a DC 32, such that it's kinda neat to have fairly early on, and pretty much useless as one advances, etc.) For sure, there's also the RP in monk, as pertains to this build. Of course, robes and kamas are an option, but plate, sword, and shield would be the better choice since we only take on 9 monk (the juicy stuff for monk in terms of robes &amp; kamas re attack bonus comes at level 20, but taking any more monk in this build would in light of the pally/bg only detract from the overall build; still, robes are a great option to have, as are those boots and other unique gear of theirs - it's the kinda combo that makes me wish I had another 10 levels to play with <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>My recommendations on weapon &amp; shield use? Yes, most definitely. Unless you want robes, I would highly recommend the use of a tower board and long sword, and the stats above reflect that, since we're likely to go with plate. However, others may feel differently on the subject, depending on their style and where they play.<br><br>As to hide, that for me was purely a personal preference, and something I like to toss into my villain type characters. I continue to be amazed, in many environments, how easy it is for a character with max'd hide and monk speed to deek out and enter hide mode; it's a bit of an amusement on my part, and fun to do. For those with different needs or play styles, by all means, once you've the bare minimum necessary to take on BG, feel free to toss those other hide points into something else; I might suggest Heal instead. If we were to do this, then I'd totally agree that we should also bring up discipline (and also taunt &amp; concentration) as high as they can possibly go, by for instance tossing those final 10 points (level 40) not into heal, but into these other skills as follows:<br><br>five (5) into Discipline, <br>four (4) into Taunt, <br>and the remaining one (1) point into Concentration. <br><br>If we were to do this, we'd have a final skill distribution as follows:<br><br>Concentration 41(43)<br>Discipline 43(50)<br>Heal 31(30)<br>Taunt 42(47)<br>Spellcraft 18(20)<br>Tumble 40(39)<br><br>For for pvp this would (I would agree) likely be the so-called saner thing to do, but I do so enjoy the hide game with my villains. Either way, it's all good! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>~ Tyr<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/21/06 15:02</span></i></p>

Correction as to alternate: in the post immediately above, in which Mick and I discussed an alternate skill distribution, I made an error in my calculation. If the alternate i.e., heal over hide were to be pursued (i.e., for PvP in particular and/or those who don't share my enjoyment with hide in villains (although I assure everyone, it is fun), the final distribution would be as follows: <br> <br>Concentration 41(43)<br>Discipline 43(50)<br>Heal 24(26)<br>Hide 5(4)<br>Spellcraft 18(20)<br>Taunt 42(47)<br>Tumble 40(39)<br><br>In other words, we dump the 5 points necessary to qualify for BG when taking our first monk pre-epic at level 5, and thereafter toss all the hide points into heal (or another of your own choosing) except at level 40 where, for those wishing to go this route, those final 10 points would instead be distributed as follows: five (5) into Discipline, four (4) into Taunt, and the remaining one (1) point into Concentration <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 06/21/06 16:20</span></i></p>
