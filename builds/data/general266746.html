I bought and started playing the game a lot later than most members here. And with two young children and a full time job, I have a lot more to experience with the game. So, I reckon it will be a long time before I get NWN2 (if ever). The thing I have found to be most frustrating is I made a lot of builds before I checked the search engine just to find that they had already been done (several times over). Thats what I get for joining the action so late! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  I, like most members I am sure, have found this guild and the boards to be extremely useful. So, thanks for still being around!

Well, I've been around lately too, I do notice a lot of our brothers have posted less and less often, activity has indeed decreased since NWN 2 came out. I was completely out of internet access last week (and PC access too btw), in the real world you can't just fix everything with an axe, or bribe the closest guy around with a diplomacy check or the like, so it does happens that real life issues interfere for that matter, but I regularly check the forum every one or two days.<br><br>For moderating issues, I've seen Kail Pendragon editing posts around, even if he doesn't posts much lately, just PM him if you are needy of a reply from him.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;mia culpa</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->It's mea culpa btw.

In Norway the "r"s are pronounced very differently from standard English. Either like the Glasgow r, that's about 2/3rds of Norway, or 1/3rd that has the rolling r just like France. Not being able to pronounce the standard r (Glasgow) is the most common speech impediment in Norway. It's a tough sound for our new countrymen to master too.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again
