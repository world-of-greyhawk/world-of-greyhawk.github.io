Right, it's been two, going on three years since I was last seen in Neverwinter, and in a month (perhaps sooner) I plan on making my return. Do to excessive boredom, I thought I would lay out my general idea for a new legit build so I could have all of the kinks worked out ahead of time. Here is what I'm looking for!<br><br>I've never really cared much about hitting hard; rather, I've always preferred evasion. So I know for sure that I want to include Epic Dodge into my build. Now, I don't know if it would be better to obtain that skill through 10 levels of Shadowdancer, and perhaps invest in two other classes to add a touch of strength (was thinking Monk), or invest in twenty levels of Rogue. I think most people would say rogue, because of the extra damage gained from sneak attack.<br><br>If memory serves me correctly, Dexterity adds to my AC. I was curious if the dexterity of a rogue and the wisdom of a monk would coincide to give me twice the amount of AC. Or can you not stack the two?<br><br>Edit: Oh, I almost forgot that I why I enjoyed Shadowdancer so much. Part of it was because I could get most of the rogue talents that you don't get until level 10 of a rogue, but the other is because of Hide-in-plain-sight. That was a really useful skill to have in combat when one of those bloody warriors came charging to so-and-so's aid. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"><br>_________________<br>You can't kill what was simply never there. . .<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By NelosNasidar on 09/12/07 13:56</span></i></p>

Well, welcome back to the addiction.<br><br>Since you've been gone awhile and are asking some fundamental questions, might I suggest that you go ahead and read a few build threads.  You'll pick up alot of knowledge from the various builds and their discussions.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117384", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>I would also suggest that you visit the nwnwiki.<br><br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page</a><br><br>Tons of info there and pretty much a MUST BOOKMARK site for nwn.
