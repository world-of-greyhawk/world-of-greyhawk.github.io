Alright, I am making a level 30 capped weaponmaster build for the server I play on. I decided to go FTR20/WM7/Rogue3. Anyways, I am having a little trouble deciding on where to spend some of the skillpoints. The thing is, truesight doesn't detect hidden creatures, it just gives you +10 to Spot. It works more like See Invisible. I was wondering whether I should sacrifice my 15 (15 modified) points in Spellcraft and 19 (18 modified) points in Healing to max out Spot or just remove all the points from heal and get 19 (18 modified) Spot instead. Here is how they are distributed so far:<br><br>32 Discipline (40)<br>4 Intimidate<br>30 Tumble (30)<br>33 UMD (32)<br>19 Healing (18)<br>15 Spellcraft (15)<br><br>In case you are wandering what his saves are...<br><br>Fort: 16 (19 vs spells w/ Spellcraft)<br>Reflex 13 (16 vs spells w/ Spellcraft)<br>Will: 8 (11 vs spells w/ Spellcraft)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By OMGZERGRUSHWTF on 12/04/05 18:38</span></i></p>

I've never played in a level 30 capped server, but nevertheless I have can tell you that a modified UMD rank of 32 does nothing - it works by multiples of 5.<br><br>Now, about Spot... if you think sneakers will be your perhaps biggest threat (at least after them casters), then it's natural you go for Spot. However if you're just hacking through other melee types, Heal might be more worthwhile. And if you have the chance of avoiding encounters with spell casters altogether, you can drop Spellcraft (and the truth is the casters will kill you whether you have Spellcraft or not).<br><br>That's what I have to say on this <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>&lt; XmikeW&gt; im glad though.. i used to think that -all- finns were supersmart nerds.. but, after seeing 1) (C) law ..2) your culture minister ..and 3) the äm-irk girls... i can say that you guys are definately typical human beings after all [smile_:-)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 12/04/05 19:14</span></i></p>
