Merry Christmas everyone, here's my present to the guild:<br><br>You'll be thinking, "a Sorcerer / Wizard build? what the heck is wrong with this guy?" and well, who knows, I might be getting crazy.<br><br>The goal in this build is to attain max amount of spell slots at all costs, that's why the spread is 20/20. The stats can be changed to a 28/28 INT/CHA spread, which makes both classes DC regular, instead, I focused on INT to have at least Wizard spells with a high DC (Wizard chosen over Sorcerer because Wizard gets bonus feats on Great INT), and INT ends with a nice value of 36, only 2 points below base maximum (38). No other class combination will get you so many arcane spell slots, so let the spamming begin.<br><br>The main drawback in the build concept is that there's no way to place all the buffs and attack spells in the quick bar, so you'll have to master some other way <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">      I suggest leaving long-term buffs out of the quickbar; he's got all type of Metamagics except Still Spell so <b>you can spam any spell as much as it can be done</b> but at the same time, metamagics will shorten even more quickslot possibilities.<br><br>As a nice possible advantage, this could work neat in PWs where rest is restricted, I've seen some have restriced rest to "rest areas", which difficults mage's effectiveness.<br><br>Playable Levels: 1-40<br>PvM and PvP<br><br>Alignment: Any<br><br>Gnome<br><br>Status: <br>STR 6<br>DEX 8<br>CON 11<br>WIS 8<br>INT 18 (36)<br>CHA 17 (19)<br><br>Make sure to take Wizard Spell School as Illusionist, that will net yet another spell slot.

You can spam Time Stop, Mordenkainen's Disjunction and all forms of Isaac's Missile Storm with Sorcerer slots (Ice Storm too but it might be weak), while spamming Horrid Wilting, Finger of Death and Wail of Banshee with Wizard slots.<br><br>And you get a nice max level Familiar as Sorcerer stacks with Wizard for Familiar level <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     <br><br>I am well aware of how easy it would be to power up this guy with maybe a single Paladin level (changing INT for CHA) or just a spread change (21/19 or 22/18) to get those cool epic spells, or even lower initial stats for DEX and CON, but either way you'll lose level 9 slots, I know it isn't a substantial loss, but level 9 slots are at max and if you really want Paladin in it, just go make an Enchanted Sorcerer.<br><br>Critics, improvements, all welcome.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/26/06 01:24</span></i></p>

Very interesting build.  I can see this working well in pure PvP arenas like Bastions of War, where you only get to rest once every time you die, then you go out and kill stuff again until your next death.  Only problem is, the lack of defensive classes (Paladin for saves, Monk for Tumble/Evasion, PM for AC and crit immunity) means you probably won't survive long enough to get all your spells off.<br><br>Still, it's an idea worth investigating.  Played cautiously enough to survive for a while, it's got a lot more staying power than your average mage build.

There is one more weakness. Low spell penetration.<br>With only 20 casterlevels and no penetration feats, the spells will often be resisted when you're dealing with epic creatures and characters.<br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan

I like it, I think I'll play it - albeit as a sorcerer 18/wizard 21/paladin 1, so I can grab Epic Warding.<br><br>That said, I think you may want to think about dropping silent spell and two Great Int for Great Cha and two spell penetration feats.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

Right, Spell Penetration is his worst problem, although he can disable and lower spell resistance with mords, I've seen high enough SR on items (mid to high magical environment) to make this build a dead puppy, and of course, he's in problems with SR monks. Use summon + familiar tactics, or if it doesn't works, improved invisibility and run for it.<br><br>Ideally you should take Epic Warding and a Paladin level, you might get neat with Sorcerer 21 / Wizard 18 / Paladin 1 CHA focused instead of INT, you'll lose a level 9 slot and a little bit of DC but gain great saving throws, you have plenty of slots anyway.<br><br>Thanks.
