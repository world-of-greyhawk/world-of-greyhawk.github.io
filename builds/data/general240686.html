I play on a level 30 server. <br><br>Weapons are capped at +3 as is armour and haste is not on -ANY- item nor are immunities to damage or elements. +1 is the maximum bonus to attributes that will be found on a single item.<br><br>Shadowdancer is dissallowed.<br><br>RDD requires 12 levels of Sorc or Bard.<br><br>A class must be used for at least 3 levels. Example: Sorc 28/Monk 1/Paladin 1 is illegal. It would have to be Sorc 24/ Monk 3/ Paladin 3.<br><br>. . .<br><br>With all of this in mind, what would a decent AB and AC be fully buffed? I ask because I have made quite a few builds and I want to know how they would stand up.<br><br>Thanks.

As always, I recommend a Cleric for such low magical enhancements.<br><br>Suppose a Ranger 15 / Cleric 15, you have buffs enough to cap AB, and buff STR pretty well too, Travel Domain for Haste, +4 Ab and damage vs favored enemies, and BAB 25. So I'd suppose, added WF, EWF and EP, and let's say 24 STR for +7, maybe up to 30 with empowered Bull's STR, fo +10 as an estimated value, your AB could leap up to around 58 buffed and 62 vs favored enemies, which is really high there IMO.<br><br>With +3 enhancements, let's say, +3 shield, +3 natural, +3 dodge, +3 deflection, +3 armor, +8 Heavy armor, +3 Tower shield, base 10, +1 from DEX = 37... that is not the highest, but should be a regular fighter type... supposing DEX based, +10 or something, would end with 38, buffs might give you a higher AC, easily to 46 with Epic Mage Armor, and to that Improved Expertise for 56, but that should be near the limits, I believe an AB of 45+ should be strong enough.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 05/15/06 02:39</span></i></p>

Hmm well here's some quick build ideas, consider them a basis for building your character.  Basically in such a low magic environment, with limited levels and a strong restriction on the RDD class, if you want to build a powerhouse melee you'll probably want to build a battle cleric.<br><br>Cleric 18/CoT 12.  Build as a battle cleric.  Take a 17/3 split to 20 so you benefit from the divine power attack.  The CoT focus coming late in the build will give you lots of bonus feats that can be used on certain epic feats in your 10 epic levels - notably armor skin, epic weapon focus, and epic prowess - letting you use your character feats for Great X stat improvements while still getting the goodies.<br><br>Cleric 18/Bard 8/Fighter 4.  Build as a battle cleric, but get bard song, tumble, UMD, and epic weapon specialization.  16 cleric/4 bard to level 20.  <br><br>Cleric 26/Fighter 4.  Over the dispel cap if there are lots of dispelling enemies, get epic weapon specialization.<br><br>There's some ideas to look at.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

I have plenty of build ideas, but my concerns lay with what I am up against.<br><br>Assuming not -EVERYONE- is a Battle Cleric, what kind of AB and AC would I have to beat? I had a Powerhouse RDD build with 45 AB that hit criticals 10-20/x3. I like that damage alot but would you think that the AB is too low?

What do you mean by 'it hit criticals on 10-20/x3'? Do you mean you actually played the character and were able to land crits on rolls of 10+, or do you mean you built a Bard/RDD/WM that used rapier, kukri, or scimitar? If the former, then you've no worries about your AB.<br>_________________<br>Where I'm playing now: <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk.</a>

Ya Bard/RDD/WM with 45-ish AB with Crit Range landing on a 10+ roll.<br><br>Would this work for the server in your opinion?

Are you talking about PvE or PvP?  I find it hard to believe that you land criticals (not just threaten them) on a roll of 10 in PvP with AB 45, for example.  And if you do in PvE, my expectation would be that you are fighting enemies weaker than you are, or else the epic enemies on your server have very low ACs.<br><br>In a PvP environment with the heavy item restrictions you're describing, I would expect arcane casters to be mopping up unless many of their spells have been weakened.<br><br>The fact is, in the end nobody knows your environment, playstyle, and preferences as well as you do.  We're all shooting in the dark, as it were.  You would probably get more useful advice and help if you posted an initial build to the Build Request Forum and asked for assistance in refining it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
