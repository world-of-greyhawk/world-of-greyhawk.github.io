OK, with all the talk of maximum spell DC's and uber saves, I thought I'd do a study, as it were, of the maximum DC on an Implosion.<br><br>This "build" is NOT geared towards playability; this is just an exercise to find the best "net" spell DC for Implosion.<br><br>Here is what I came up with. It uses the no-save spells Battletide and Prayer as well as Curse Song to "add" to the spell DC.<br><br>Human<br>Str 14<br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Wis 18 (36)<br>Int 10<br>Cha 8<br><br>1 Cleric (1) - Spell Focus: Evocation, Spell Penetration<br>2 Cleric (2)<br>3 Cleric (3) - Combat Casting<br>4 Cleric (4) - WIS 19<br>5 Cleric (5)<br>6 Cleric (6) - Greater Spell Focus: Evocation<br>7 Cleric (7)<br>8 Cleric (8) - WIS 20<br>9 Cleric (9) - Great Spell Penetration<br>10 Cleric (10)<br>11 Cleric (11)<br>12 Cleric (12) - Improved Combat Casting, WIS 21<br>13 Cleric (13)<br>14 Cleric (14)<br>15 Cleric (15) - Extend Spell<br>16 Cleric (16) - WIS 22<br>17 Bard (1)<br>18 Bard (2) - Curse Song<br>19 Bard (3)<br>20 Bard (4) - WIS 23<br><br>21 Cleric (17) - Epic Spell Focus: Evocation<br>22 Cleric (18)<br>23 Cleric (19)<br>24 Cleric (20) - Great Wis I, WIS 25<br>25 CoT (1)<br>26 CoT (2) - Great Wis II<br>27 CoT (3) - Great Wis III<br>28 CoT (4) - Great Wis IV, WIS 29<br>29 Cleric (21)<br>30 Bard (5) - Great Wis V<br>31 Bard (6)<br>32 Bard (7) - WIS 31<br>33 Bard (8) - Great Wis VI<br>34 Bard (9)<br>35 Bard (10)<br>36 Bard (11) - Great Wis VII, WIS 34<br>37 Bard (12)<br>38 Bard (13)<br>39 Bard (14) - Great Wis VIII<br>40 Bard (15) - WIS 36<br><br>Base Spell DC<br>10 + Wis 13 + SL 9 + ESF 6 = 38<br><br>Effective Spell DC (+12 Wis)<br>Base 38 + Wis 6 + BattleTide 2 + Curse Song 2 + Prayer 1 = 49<br><br>Of course, this would require you to have Battletide up and running, as well as casting Prayer and then Curse Song, and then finally Implosion.  That's 3 rounds that someone would be beating on you; so it's not really realistic.  But nonetheless, its the best I could do.<br><br>Am I missing anything?   I was looking for spells or abilities that lowered DC's without allowing for a save.  If anyone can add to it or do better, I would love to see your ideas.<br><br>Cheers.

You missed +3 DC special bonus for Implosion. Get 4 more CoT (att he expense of cleric) for 2 more Great WIS to raise by a further point your DC. <br><br>The DC is high but penetrating SR will be a problem. Implosion does not disregard SR unfortunately. BTW, ICC is an epic feat and you are selecting it preepic. Get some haste and the time spent activating the save reducers will be halved.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?

I'll drop some Cleric levels for CoT.  I'll lose some 9th level castings, but this isn't about playability (which is also why I wasn't particularly concerned with beating SR.)   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>I was vaguely aware of a special DC for Implosion but I wasn't exactly sure what it was.

I just didn't want anyone to think that I was trying to create a solid 1-40 Cleric.  I was just playing around with theoretical ways to get the best DC on Implosion. <br><br>Call it boredom, I suppose  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
