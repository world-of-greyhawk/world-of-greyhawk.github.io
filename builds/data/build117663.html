You have Dwarven fighters and you have Dwarven melee specialists. The latter combine offense with defense and excel in both, and they are the best fighters the dwarves have to offer. They protect their kin from any threat, both magical and natural, with steel alone. They are usually good healers too, and can replace clerics in most occasions.<br><br>Race: Dwarf<br>Alignment: Any Lawful (neutral or good is best since it suits a Dwarven Defender better)<br><br>Starting stats:<br><br>Str 16<br>Dex 14<br>Con 16<br>Wis 10<br>Int 14<br>Cha 6<br><br>1.

agreed.   I understand, i think, why you went with so many fighter levels, and the 7 wm levels, but why only 5 defender?  IMHO this is almost useless.  You get no defender damage reduction, or things like that, which is why one would play a defender (for defense?), isnt it?<br><br>Oh, btw, if you were to take exotic, and specialize in dwarf waraxe (classic defender wpn, imo), with the *4 from wm you can get 130 dam per on crits, with that high str!  hmm or was that my cleric/wm/ftr!  Sorry, just had to point that out, cuz you said this build could replace a cleric!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>peace
