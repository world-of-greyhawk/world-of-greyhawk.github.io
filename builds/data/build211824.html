<b>Playable from 1-40, PvM build. PvP vs good-guys.</b><br><br>       There was a knock on the Commanders door. His servant came in. "pardon me sir, but the Dwarven commander is here."<br>"Send him in." He replied. A bit early, but that's fine. The sooner i get the grumpy one out of here the better.<br> "Greetings and well met, Commander!" a surprisingly pleasant and charming Dwarf spoke to him. "I am Carwin, the commander of the Dwarven army."<br>The commander was dumbstruck a few moments, taken by the Dwarfs winning person.<br>"Well met. You are early, that is good. We have much to discuss."<br>They started talking about their plans of conquest, and the cooperation of their army's.<br>The Human commander was again surprised at how easy the Dwarf was to speak to, but he was still a tough negotiator, as he had suspected.<br>Suddenly the Dwarf stated sharply. "Send your guards away, I have one secret proposition to give, and noone can hear it!"<br>The commander was reluctant to comply, but something made him trust this Dwarf. He went to the door and told his guards to take leave the post. He followed them with his eyes until they were gone.<br>"There, my guards are out of earshot, what was that you......" He suddenly felt a crippling pain in his spine, and with his last breath he knew he had just made a grave mistake. His last....<br><br>"So, now we'll just have to await the Dwarf, and your two armies will have lost their leaders. Then we'll see who conquers..." He wiped the blood off of his battleaxe and sat down in a dark corner to await the Dwarf.<br><br>_________________<br><br>This is an attempt from me to create as iconic a Blackguard as possible. And a Charismatic dwarf to, who said that wasn't doable?<br>This uses the same classes as one of Grizz's builds <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "208450", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>but it is very different.<br><br>I also have a different version using other classes <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "211824", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>v.2 seems slightly more powerful, though I like this build best, more feats, and you don't run around with wings, as so many on my PW does.<br><br> I have noticed that a lot of good guys out there really enjoys their smite's, so imagine when Goody-Two-Shoes arrive to stop you from bullying others and attacks your undead friend. When he feels the SMITE from your battleaxe, powered by a decent sneak attack, he's in for a treat. After that, get him down, and SMITE+SNEAK, SMITE+SNEAK until he buys a farmhouse.

Or two of the above. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   <br><br>This is a PvP build only vs good-aligned opponents, though you got UMD galore to get buffs, invisibilty and such to generate sneaks. IKD is a must to. 4 Rogue levs seems like 1 to much, but you get three early which makes him more playable, and 1 in the end for skilldump. And the alternative is 1 fighter level, which brings nothing. <br><br>I would like a better AB, but sorry. I would like an even CHA score, see above for how. I would like Epic Fiendish Servant, but I chose different. The build also has few hp's very few considering that it is a Dwarven melee build. The original build had Toughness instead of IKD, but it is better as it is.<br><br>So, please tell me what you think and give me your suggestions.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 09/22/05 13:49</span></i></p>

I like this build, and not because he's a dwarf.  He certainly is unique, and is yet another excellent illustration to how dwarves tend to do everything well.  May have to give this one a go.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Glad you like it, since your build was an inspiration. I mixed that with my old BG, which I posted here as the v.2. And the result was, if I may say so, quite charming. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>You say Dwarves to everything well, I disagree.....<br>They do it best!
