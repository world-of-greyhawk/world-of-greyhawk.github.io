I have a question for you master builders out there.  I am playing on a RP PW out there, I have a 1/2 Orc Fighter Double Bladed Sword user.  I'm grooming him for dev crit.  I plan on being fighter all the way to 20 so that I max out my BAB.  From there I plan on becoming a Palemaster to get that crit immunity. Here are my questions:<br><br>Which arcane spellcaster class would you suggest and why?<br><br>Do I need 3 levels in that class or will one be enough to then switch to Palemaster?<br><br>If I take Palemaster up to lvl 15/16 can a 1/2 Orc with 6 Int and 6 Cha even cast an Epic spell?<br><br>===<br><br>My arcane stats:<br><br>Assume 6 Inteligence and 6 Charisma (might be 8, can't remember offhand).<br><br>At level 14 I currently have 23 str.  Focusing on getting 25 str for the dev crit.  Feat selection is currently geared for dev crit needs, plus the typical fighter stuff for a dual weapon fighter (using 2 bladed sword), with knockdown.  Keeping in mind my low Int, I can't take expertise and many other feats that need 13+ Int.<br><br>Thanks all!

PM lvl15 can cast epic regardless of this.  Your save for the knockdown will be bad though.

Fighter 20/Bard 4/PM 16 <br><br>I'd suggest you take Fighter 17/Bard 3 Pre-epic though to save some Fighter feats for epic levels - you will lose 1 ab but I think it's worth it.<br><br>On the other hand I'm not really sure if getting the Epic Spells are worth it maybe Fighter 26/Bard 4/PM 10 would be better and you gain one more feat that way.

If I take Wiz, then I can use any wand. If I take Bard, then I have to spend points in UMD to be able to use a wand.  There are wands of StoneSkin on this server.  I'm also thinking that I can get someone to make a Flame Weapon wand. Or many other buff wands.<br><br><br>If I take wiz, then I can't buff tumble up for an extra 1 in ac.  Remember that I have LOW Int and only get 1 skill point per level, and most of that is being dumped into diciplin.<br><br>Can Epic spells be cast in armor without the Still Spell Feat?
