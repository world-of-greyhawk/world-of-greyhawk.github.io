Well, since noone else has posted a build here besides me in a LOOOOOOOOOOOOONG time, it is time that I finally post a build, the LAST PRC build, im afraid.  It is the last cuz after I post it, everyone will move to PRC and never ever play NWN again!  I can only hope <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">     and I know this wont be so.<br><br>Is this the ULTIMATE char?  well, let me explain my reasoning for this.<br><br>I) We end up with a pure caster level!  THat's right, we get 40 levels of divine caster!  This is undispellable!  This is 80 rounds of Blade barriers!  This is casting extended buffs for soooo long that you could leave and go to work and come back and still be fully buffed!<br><br>II) We have 5 (max) levels of Heirophant, which is a divine clerics DREAM!!  We get Spell Power +10!  For those that dont know, it is +10 to spell DC!  This means that with this build and +12 to wisdom, we get a 46 dc on Implosion!  Higher than any nwn build (esp with ONLY 19 base wisdom!), and only 9 off the max DC possible of 57 achieved with a wis 38 heirophant cleric.<br><br>III) We get EPIC spells! Yes, this guy gets Epic Mage armor, warding and ALL the others (with spellcraft gear).  <br><br>IV) We get PRC spells.  FOr a cleric, we get a simple little level 2 spell, Living Undeath.  THis is what I call, "Pocket Palemaster"  It grants you immunity to crits!  <br><br>V) WE get Dev crit at lv 21!  Yes a pure divine caster with dev crit at 21!  WOW!  And the best part is, it works!<br><br>VI)  We have SoV and Firestorm to take out those nasty crit immune things like Golems and such.  I have taken on a map full of gols and been done with them in a mere 4 mins!  <br><br>VII) Oh, and since hes a cleric, we get Divine power and favor, battletide, prayer, bless, and a few other prc spells to boost both damage and ab to the 20 cap limit!<br><br>VIII) Darkfire!<br><br>IX)  He gets to use a rapier/scrimter!  With a nice bard/wiz companion (or a keenable spell from an itm) we get 12-20 crit range!<br><br>X)  HALF ORC!!  For the ultimate coolness factor.  And for the newbies to look at you in awe as you have built the ultimate character possible!<br><br>Basically, this character, in the hands of a knowledgable player is able to solo almost anything possible!  WIth the right gear, he becomes a living GOD!<br><br>Are there flaws?  Yes, Kill wiz/sorcs before they can breech you!  Loosin the buffs can make you weak.  But once they are down.<br><br>Here he is, my Beast<br><br>Race half orc <br>Alignment Lawful Neutral <br><br><br>STR 20(32) <br>DEX 8 <br>CON 10 <br>WIS 14(20) <br>INT 12 <br>CHA 6 <br><br>Leveling <br>01 cleric1 D2 power attack [trickery/protection] <br>02 cleric2 <br>03 cleric3 D3 cleave <br>04 cleric4 s21 <br>05 cleirc5 D4 <br>06 cleric6 spell focus: evoc <br>07 cleric7 D5 <br>08 hospitaler1 s22 [martial] <br>09 cleric8 weapon focus: rapier <br>10 cleric9 <br>11 cleric10 <br>12 cleric11 improve crit: rapier s23 <br>13 cleric12 <br>14 cleric13 <br>15 cleric14 great cleave <br>16 cleric15 s24 <br>17 cleric16 <br>18 cleirc17 silent spell <br>19 hospitaler2 <br>20 cleric18 s25 <br>21 hospitaler3 overwhelm crit/devastatin crit: rapier <br>22 hospitaler4 <br>23 hospitaler5 great wis I w 15 <br>24 hospitaler6 great wis II w 17 <br>25 hospitaler7 great wis III w 18 <br>26 hospitaler8 <br>27 hospitaler9 epic wpn foc:rapier/ great str I s26 <br>28 heirophant1 spell power +2 w19 <br>29 heirophant2 spell power +4 <br>30 heirophant3 spell power +6/ great str II s 27 <br>31 heirophant4 spell power +8 <br>32 heirophant5 spell power +10 s 28 <br>33 hospitaler10 great str III s29 <br>34 hospitaler11 <br>35 hospitaler12 <br>36 hospitaler13 great str IV / great wis IV s 31 w 20 <br>37 hospitaler14 <br>38 hospitaler15 <br>39 hospitaler16 great spell foc:evo / epic prowess <br>40 cleric19 s 32 <br><br><br>Skills <br>on cleric levels/heirophant levels, take Lore, Spellcraft <br>on Hospitaler levels, Discipline, Lore <br>end skills Discipline 21 Lore 43 spellcraft 43 conc 20<br>HP 320 max <br><br>AB 40/35/30<br><br>Saves <br>Fort 24 <br>Ref 15 <br>Will 32 <br><br>With a +10 wpn we get an ab of 66!

Domain doesnt matter.  I took prot for something different (the minor globe was nice in lower lvls).  Strength could be nice with div power, BUT, playing this guy through, I seem to always have way too many div powers left as is.<br><br>Oh, I originally thought that silent spell was a great choice for extra Harms.  I took extended at lv 18 for div powers.  There is something so right about lv 40 extended div powers!  80 rounds!! *sigh<br><br>There are a few subtleties to this build.  Remember, IF you try him, you have ONLY lv 4 spells up to lv 23!  This isnt as bad as it seems.  I delayed heiro til 28, for example, to get the hospitaler odd lv feats done asap in epic, allowing me to add AB (ewf) and get wisdom to 19.  You do need to cast lv 7 spells to enter as heirophant, so technically, you could move that around abit.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

As a footnote, I am rapidly approaching lv 40 on the pw where this guy was created.  I made one little change to the build: at 39 I took silent spell vs gr spell foc! <br><br>Why?  When I started the build I thought it would be great to have implosion with dev crit.  IT turns out that dev crit is so nice that it works best with SoV.  THere are alot of undeads on the server so the silent was taken to get extra mass heals and heals.  All in all it becomes a personal choice (one of the beauties of clerics is the freedom they allow).<br><br>Off to get lv 40!

NO.<br><br>You would have to take Dev crit later on, and the whole thing with this build is to get it ASAP.<br><br>Nw, IF you can live with that, then sure.  You will have to make the adjustments on your own though.  YOu will be 2 str down.  You have 2 extra stats to Charisma that you dont need.<br><br>When I was a younger player, I too thought that Half Orcs were not that good.
