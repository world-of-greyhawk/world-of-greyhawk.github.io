Grimnir77 mentioned Rangers... here's a character concept I find interesting.<br><br><b>playable 1 - 40 PvM</b><br><br>Introduction:<br>Mighty Warrior of the North<br><br>Perhaps novelty (but not novelty as in "it sucks but I think it's kewl ^^"; it may not be a 'maximized' build, but it is playable and even fairly good).

Well, let me tell you. 4 levels is well than enough, as it gives you Cat's Grace and Eagle's Splendour (which is what we're going for). The extra Great Charisma is a nice bonus. I didn't go with 5 HS because I found losing Bane of Enemies or one Paladin level too big a sacrifice for an extra feat.<br><br>And you're thinking that he has only 3 FEs.

i liked using these classes together when i made my build.  i used less ranger, which was my only regret.  nice use of hs (only 4! wow! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  ).  nice use of cha for a warrior.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"You cannot pass!"

Oh right, sorry. Nevertheless, I think the 15th Paladin level is well worth not having Armour Skin. Besides, using a shield is possible, too, if more AC is needed.<br>_________________<br>Now is my day's work done;<br>I'll take good breath:<br>Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of<br>blood and death.
