Why not rogue at level one for more skillpoints?

Aye, thats a good point about the skill points at level 1, although I find that during the first 3 levels or so I always seem to roll maximum hitpoints first time, so I went with these instead.<br><br>I guess that either approach is equally valid as a starting point though.

Surely you only need to max one of Spot or Listen? I play on a server where these skills are very important too, and most players choose one to max, sometimes putting 5 points in the other for the synergy bonus.<br><br>If you could drop either Spot or Listen, you could drop Strength to 16 (it finishes on 27 anyway, that last point isn't doing much for you) and Int to 13, allowing you to boost Con to 16 for an extra hit point per level.

Well, dropping int to 13 looses 40 skill points and dropping str by 1 means that bulls strength can only get my str up to 31 (assuming I find/have a potion) wheras at 27 str can reach 32.  <br><br>Also the higher str allows slightly earlier qualification for overwhelming crit and dev crit.<br><br><br>*edit* on review it looks like I forgot to post some of the stat increases (all go into Str) on the original post.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By M1ke47 on 04/14/05 18:38</span></i></p>

I would consider dropping exotic weapons and instead of scythe, scimitar, and heavy flail, taking great axe, rapier, and heavy flail.  This way, you always have a type of damage available.  Great axe is slashing only, while scythe is slashing and piercing.  Scimitar is slashing only, while rapier is piercing only.  Unfortunately, if you have a weapon that does two types of physical damage, either of the two damage reductions will counteract it.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.rpgmods.net/forgottenworlds/phpBB2/" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

What is it about the scythe that makes it a better choice for "effective dev crit" over the scimitar with it's extended crit range? I know the scythe has the great crit multiplier, but I don't see how it makes for more effective dev critting. I would think scimitar makes for more effective dev critting. On a PW where Dev Crit is disabled the scythe's damage output would definitely be more attractive. Also by dropping scythe you wouldn't need to take Exotic Weap Proficiency so early. Perhaps you could take it later in the build, just to keep up the adaptability of the build.<br><br>I like Yar's advise on choosing weapons to produce a specific type of weapon-damage.<br><br>All in all, I really like the build.

Well, by the phrase "effective dev crit pre epic" I meant that below level 20, if you crit with a scythe, doing 5 times damage...you are highly likely to kill your victim, thats all.
