Just after some opinions really, as I am a bit undecided.<br><br>I'm after a build for a particular PW, below are the parameters of the PW:<br><br>- Must have minimum 3 levels per class<br>- Can multiclass 2 Prestige Classes, eg. CoT &amp; WM<br>- Can carry over skill points<br>- No permanent Immunity items, except Fear<br>- Max enhancement is +5, but these are rare, generally +3 in merchants and +4 treasure<br>- No perma haste or true seeing<br>- True seeing changed to reveal invisible creatures and gives a bonus of 20 to Spot skill<br>- Start with 2 levels and very little gold. <br><br>Trying to decide what would be best for both 1-40 development and final outcome. Preferably a meleer with some abilities to buff, but this is not a must.<br><br>I had been thinking along the following lines:<br><br>Cleric, Fighter, Harper Scout<br>Paladin, CoT, HS<br>Cleric, RDD, Bard<br><br>GMW works as normal, so +5 enhancement is quite beneficial, hence looking at Cleric/ Paladin.<br><br>Ideally I would prefer a good all round capability, with a decent AC, AB, HP and saves.<br><br>Any thoughts, ideas or suggestions will be seriously considered.<br><br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 05/20/06 09:03</span></i></p>

Take the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225446", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Order of Jormundgandr</a>, the setting is low enough for him to practically beat everything...<br><br>But well, dragon builds aren't specially the most playable, so I'd probably take a Fighter 6 /Cleric 16 /Dwarven Defender 18 or something like that, a STR-based dual-weilding buffed Dwarven Defender can be nasty, one of my favorites, I like Two-bladed sword for this guy... just noticed there isn't a build with this combination... but I'm still making another build, so probably I'll make it on the future.

I should point out that I have discovered that the no immunity on items applies only to custom items. You can buy equipment with all immunities pretty readily.

Thanks Xylo and Thax.. to be honest I had considerd both the Veteran party leader v2 and the order of jurm... but was curious to know the general reaction to that sort of setting.<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

Yeah. There's a mix of standard and custom items available from differing sources. You can't get every standard item mind you.

The toolset items are very powerful in a lot of cases, sometimes I think they included a lot of immunity items to make it possible for sub-standard builds to get through the campaigns.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
