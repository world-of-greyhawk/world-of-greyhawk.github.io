I was just thinking about the most hit points possible on any character.<br><br>By timing your feats right you can get epic toughness 1-10. By going as little druid as possible and as cleric as possible to achieve this you'll have as much Champion of Torm levels as you can which will give you more hit dice and access to more bonus feats.<br><br>Take your levels in this order:<br>---pre epic---<br>* 13 druid<br>* 4 cleric (choose war and XYZ domains)<br>* 3 champion of torm<br>---epic---<br>* 18 CoT<br>* 1 druid<br>* 1 CoT<br><br>Starting stats:<br>8 str<br>8 dex<br>8 con<br>18 wisdom<br>12 intelligence<br>16 charisma<br><br>Bump wisdom at every chance. Don't touch the other stats.<br><br>level___feat<br>1 - blind fight<br>1 - toughness<br>3 - Weapon Focus: Sickle<br>Feats levels 6 - 18 doesn't matter what you take.<br><br>21 - Great Wisdom I (CoT bonus feat)<br>21 - Epic Tougness I<br>23 - Great Wisdom II (CoT bonus feat)<br>24 - Epic Toughness II<br>25 - Great Wisdom III (CoT bonus feat)<br>27 - Epic Toughness III<br>27 - Epic Toughness IV (CoT bonus feat)<br>30 - Epic Toughness V<br>31 - Epic Toughness VI (CoT epic bonus feat)<br>33 - Epic Toughness VII<br>35 - Epic Toughness VIII (CoT epic bonus feat)<br>36 - Epic Toughness IX<br>39 - Dragon Shape<br>40 - Epic Toughness X (CoT epic bonus feat)<br><br>I went cleric with war domain for access to endurance (+2 con) and war domain (+5 constitution) for 5 rounds + my charisma bonus. Druid has aura of vitality (+4 con) and blood frenzy (+2 con). So I can get +12 with no items.<br><br>Hit point calculation<br><br>14 levels druid x 7 hit points = +98<br>4 levels cleric x 7 hit points = +28<br>22 levels CoT x 9 hit points = +198<br>Toughness = +40<br>Epic Toughness 1-10 = +200<br>Blood Frenzy = +40<br>Aura of Vitality = +80<br>Endurance = +40<br>War Domain Powers = +80<br>Shifting changes base con. = +440<br>Shifting grants temp hit points = +100<br>--------<br><br>Total = 1344 hit points.<br><br>I think that is the most possible for any PC. To get the necessary wisdom before level 39 you have to have at least 3 epic feats go towards great wisdom 1-3. And choosing dragon shape at level 39 takes away another epic feat. This only leaves 3 epic feats to go towards epic toughness.<br><br>Going dwarven defender or barbarian, although has d12 hit points per level, can't make up the difference of getting epic toughness. Taking epic toughness one time gives an extra 20 hit points. It takes 10 levels of dwarven defender or barbarian to get an extra 20 hits on the CoT. So going CoT is the best way to achieve the max hit points. That and multi-classing with cleric.<br><br>cdaulepp<br><br>Edited By cdaulepp on 03/25/04 11:26:18<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 19:53</span></i></p>

Commentary by cdualepp and BRIAN FELLOW:<br><br>    Quote: Posted 03/25/04 20:16:23 (GMT) by BRIAN FELLOW<br><br>    Hmm I wonder why you put extra points in charisma. Wouldn't u spend those 4 points into constitution? That would be about extra 80 hp for that build. With starting stats of 12 CON and 14 CHA.<br><br><br>The charisma was for a longer war domain duration.<br><br>It doesn't matter what your starting stats are in str, dex, or con. It does not change your total hit points when you shift into dragon. When shifted my con raises to 32. I have figured in +440 hit points because my con modifier is +11.<br><br>If I start with a higher constitution than 8 when I shift I'll just gain less than +440. If I had a starting con of 16, I'll still end up at 32 con when I shift. So there's no point in putting any points into constitution for a dragon build.<br><br>cdaulepp<br><br>edit: I did make a mistake in my original calculation though. I just realized it.<br><br>    Quote: <br>    Starting stats:<br>    8 str<br>    8 dex<br>    8 con<br>    18 wisdom<br>    12 intelligence<br>    16 charisma<br>    Hit point calculation<br><br>    14 levels druid x 7 hit points = +98<br>    4 levels cleric x 7 hit points = +28<br>    22 levels CoT x 9 hit points = +198<br>    Toughness = +40<br>    Epic Toughness 1-10 = +200<br>    Blood Frenzy = +40<br>    Aura of Vitality = +80<br>    Endurance = +40<br>    War Domain Powers = +80<br>    Shifting changes base con. = +440 *** error here ****<br>    Shifting grants temp hit points = +100<br>    --------<br><br>    Total = 1344 hit points.<br>    cdaulepp<br><br><br>If I'm starting with 8 con (-1 modifier) and going to 32 in dragon form (+11 modifier) that represents a total of a 12 point swing. So I should have posted +480 instead of +440.<br><br>That makes my version have TOTAL 1384 hit points.<br><br>cdaulepp<br><br>Edited By cdaulepp on 03/25/04 15:31:46
