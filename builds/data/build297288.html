Well, I've lurked around here long enough. I suppose I should take a turn at getting prodded by the masters. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>This PC is based on Corp. Kalam Mekhar, Assassin and Bridgeburner in Steven Erickson's Masterful Malazan Book of the Fallen series. Kalam is from the Holy Desert of Raraku, and has worked for the Seven Cities, Empress Laseen, Whiskeyjack, and the Rope (patron of assassins) himself at various points in his career. He's powerful, lethal, and much more reliant on his skills than many of his former associates in the Claw who rely on magic instead.<br><br>This is almost certainly not the most powerful build imaginable, but I think it reflects the intended character. That said, there are plenty of ranger/assassin/sds on the forum, but only 3 that have a spread similar to this one.<br><br>Shadow Stalker-<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "229497", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> Which is a dex-based build which uses blunt weapons.<br><br>Silent Assassin-<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "229497", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> Which is not intended to be a play to 40 build.<br><br>and andymax's <br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117591", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> Which is a dexer elf.

Couple Additional Notes: Base Death Attack DC is 37.<br><br>In the books, Kalam actually uses longknives as his preferred weapon. Since NWN doesn't use those, I gave him longswords here, since Seven Cities Longknives are almost as long as longswords. In the PW I'm working on, there are longknives. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

I recommend you to avoid writing on your build all the abilities your classes gain automatically upon reaching a certain level (like Uncanny Dodge, Death Attack, HiPS, etc.) unless it's really critical to point it out, rest assured we all know them already. Writing them all only makes it harder to read.<br><br>Another thing, when posting builds please write your HP as if you rolled max each time, it works better for comparative purposes. I believe it should be 360.<br><br>You could get +1 AB if you change 1 level of Assassin for Shadowdancer or Ranger pre-epic, you wouldn't lose anything by doing so.<br><br>I wouldn't agree on taking longswords on a dual-wielder, since you're taking a shortsword on your offhand anyway, why not take weapon focuses on shortsword altogether? Is it for RP?<br>_________________<br>The world is full of lies! “Thou shalt not kill”, “Thou shalt not steal”. These are all deceptions. “I don't want to be killed”, “I don't want to be a victim of theft”, that is why they use lies like justice and morals to protect their weak selves.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 06/02/08 18:07</span></i></p>

I don't know anything about "longknives", so excuse me if i am completely wrong here. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">   I imagine long knives as some kind of long bladed daggers, or narrow shaped short swords.<br>Would be better in a dual wielder as the off hand weapon is small and both "longknives" benefit from one common weapon focus.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

hehe, actually Seven City longknives are nearly as long as longswords, just considerably narrower. They don't hold up to parries well on heavier blades, but they strike almost like a rapier. On the PW I'm building, I used the longest short sword base for them. But that's not entirely accurate.<br><br>RPing him, I go dual-longswords. I dropped one to get the proper read for here. I can't stand dual-wielding short swords with an STR based PC, to be perfectly honest.

In addition to not posting each and every ability and feat you gain from class, you should include class-levels. I even think it's required. It eases up the reading and generates better and quicker feedback. Like this:<br><br>18: Ranger10: FE:Dwarf; IC:longsword<br><br>You see? I'll do the edits. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>*Edit* Hemh....<br><br>You MUST include:<br>-max hp<br>-unmodified skilldistribution like this: Hide 43(56) f.ex.<br>-class levels in title<br>-Damage with mundane equipment. Should be 1d8+8 in your case(plus crit range 17-20/x2 or whatever it is) + 13d6 death attack f.ex.<br>-Naked AC. Why all these chars run around naked is another question entirely. Probably a funny party though. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   <br>- Can't think of anything else right now. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   <br><br>Feedback: Take your last Ranger level later to get a better dump in Discipline. Take only 8 assassin levels pre-epic to gain +1 AB/BAB as mentioned. Your AB is already suffering. Why the late increase in DEX? Seems to me that 2 more STR would be better. You don't have Imp crit in a STR build. Maybe not necessary, but to me it seems a better choice than PA+Cleave.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 06/02/08 19:59</span></i></p>

The dex increase was inevitable because the Assassin bonus choice was Great Dex (I'd used the others). It was either have an odd number str or an even number dex. I evened out the dex to get the base bonues.<br><br>Improved Crit would be nice in the build, though not having cleave in a STR build makes me shudder too. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Thanks for the edit and feedback. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
