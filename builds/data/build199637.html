ahem... unarmed strike cannot be your weapon of choice... its not a weapon... <br><br>but you could do kamas and get a fairly deadly kama monk with  a build similar to yours <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br>just take monk at lvl 1<br><br>you AB with a choice weapon should be (29) base + 8 (STR) + 7 WM + 4 from feats (some of which you did not pick)<br><br>thats an AB of 48, which a choice weapon<br><br>which is very good, especially for a monk.<br><br>but it would seem that you have a lot of +con for no apparent reason, other than HP, which isn't reason enough, and a lot of Epic Toughness.<br><br>In many cases, the amounf of HP you have is only relevant to a certain degree. if you can hit more often and do more damage to your enemy faster, than you can take him down faster, and thats worth a lot more.<br>but thats just an opinion <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By aluka on 06/15/05 01:20</span></i></p>

I want this feat:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;21 Weapon Master 11 Great String I</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I figure that's great for a lute-playing Bard! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>Just joking. Anyway, CON 16 is really pretty good and - coupled with the Toughness feat - it provides lots of HPs. In light of that, I'd say don't bother with the GRT CON feats or raising CON at all. Take all your ability increases in STR and get as many GRT STR feats as you can (I'm pretty sure you can easily get 6) Use your WM bonus feats for Armor Skin, Epic Prowess, Over Crit, Dev Crit, Epic WF, and the leftovers for Epic Toughness. Like this:<br><br>21 Weapon Master 11 Great STR I<br>22 Weapon Master 12<br>23 Weapon Master 13 Epic Superior Weapon Focus, Epic Weapon Focus<br>24 Weapon Master 14 GRT STR II<br>25 Weapon Master 15<br>26 Weapon Master 16 Over Crit<br>27 Monk 5 Great Strength III<br>28 Weapon Master 17<br>29 Weapon Master 18<br>30 Weapon Master 19 GRT STR IV, Devastating Critical<br>31 Weapon Master 20<br>32 Weapon Master 21<br>33 Weapon Master 22 GRT STR V, Epic Prowess<br>34 Weapon Master 23<br>35 Weapon Master 24<br>36 Weapon Master 25 GRT STR VI, Armor Skin<br>37 Monk 6 Knockdown*, Improved Knockdown*<br>38 Weapon Master 26<br>39 Weapon Master 27 Epic Toughness I (or your choice)<br>40 Weapon Master 28 Epic Toughness II<br><br>This way, you end up with 32 STR, so the DC of your Dev Crit is higher, as well as your AB and damage.<br><br>You'll also end up with +4 better AB overall. You still get Dev Crit at level 30.<br><br>I'd also consider switching Blind Fight to level 3, take Power Attack at level 15, and Great Cleave at level 18.<br><br>One last thing: I'd spread the Monk levels out in pre-epic, like you do in epic levels. Take them at levels 2, 7, 12, and 17. That way you can skill dump into Tumble to get the benefits of the AC boost ASAP. Makes it a bit more playable.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Even with the monk's cleave you still need power attack to get great cleave.  I guess deflect arrows and the knockdowns are nice.  Bard or Rogue would seem to be a better choice than monk.

Excelent points, all of them. The 6th monk level at lvl 37 is useful two fold. One, it obviously brings with it Improved Knockdown, and two, it allows you to maximize Tumble.

I completely forgot to mention this <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> . Thank you griphook for reminding me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> .
