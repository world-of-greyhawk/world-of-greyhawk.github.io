Hi all <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>This is my first go at acually making a build that fits the way in which I want to play the game!<br>Pls feel free to drag it through the mud <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>First I must say that the race I play is Drow, I understand that this is not <br>avalible in all worlds however I belive that if you make builds that are not <br>suited to the world you play in then what is the point! If no drow in your <br>world please feel free to -2 from INT and Cha and disregard the spell res.<br><br>That said there are a few things that I wanted from a build and they are dual wielding, <br>spell casting, high AC and a decent melee presence.

Nice build, just one question that I can't figure out.<br><br>Where do you get the Spell Resistance of 52 from?<br><br>Otherwise it looks good, on first glance <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Errr..... But NWN with only the original expansions cannot have Drow o_o. Soz. Maybe it should be moved to the PRC builds section...<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:. Only those who have known darkness in<br>(OvO) their hearts will see the shadows in life...<br>(|__|)<br>..".."..

I only have NWN and the two expansions but i think they modded my player world to allow the drow a duerger chars... that is why I explained at the begining about the drow. However the build is essentially the same playing as an elf! Just a few less skill points and spells per day and like I said disregard the spell res.. <br><br>52 comes from drow starting with 12 spell res and gaining 2 per char lvl.

I f any builds look like yours? I doubt any other exact combination has been used so many times. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "203009", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117596", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117494", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "129836", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>Yeah, I know, one of those builds are mine. I made it before the search engine were born. <br><br>It makes for a strong AC build, this combination. You should mix your bard/RDD levels pre epic, to even your skill allocation out more. Hitting lvl 20 as 12 bard/8 RDD to maximise AB, which is not to great. It is possible for you to get 2 epic spells, if you take them at 39.<br><br>And 1 thing about the kukri. It's often overlooked you say. Its perhaps the most common dual-wield weapon if they can afford exotic prof.<br><br>Has a nice amount of self buffs to help some of his AB problems to, and song is undispellable.
