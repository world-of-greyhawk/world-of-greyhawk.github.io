Sooo here's the thing. I made a character on a server where the max level is 5, so I thought, Hey, why don't I go with a  guy who specializes in Parrying?! Everyone's AB probably isn't great, and I don't have to worry about AC.<br><br>BUT then I started wondering how parry really works. Everyone will have 1 attack unless they're monk or duel wielding...So, a few questions<br><br>1. If everyone has 1 attack, and someone is duel wielding, will I be able to block the main hand, and the off hand with my only 1 attack per round?<br>2. Will I actually be able to reposte, since I only have 1 attack per round?<br>3. If I was dual wielding, and I can't reposte with only 1 attack per round, can I reposte with my offhand weapon?<br><br>Hmm..That's all I can think of right now..Opinions? Answers?

I've not tested Parry, so the following info is anecdotal and gleaned from many of the posts I've read on the boards:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 02/25/08 05:31 (GMT) -- Endalyor<br><br>Sooo here's the thing.

Riposte occurs if your Parry skill is more than 9 points higher than your attacker's AB.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;3.

Answers?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>You can only Parry 1 attack per flurry, maximum 3 attacks per round, but only as many attacks as your character has from your BAB (to the maximum of 3). So the offhand doesn't enter the equation.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
