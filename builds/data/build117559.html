While I have never posted before, I thought that this topic was too interesting to resist. A couple of months ago I got this random idea to build a Wizard/Pal Master/Dwarven Defender.

Even with a 40 STR enemies will find it hard to even damage you. You have more than 500 hp and can cast wonderful buff spells like Greater Stoneskin and Improved Invisibility. The reason you go for Devastating Critical is because you cannot kill a Prismatic Dragon very easily with this build. This build can be improved upon, but at its core is the toughest class combo in the game.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 02:48</span></i></p>

Awful.  You know you need at least Strength 25 to take Devastating Critical, right?  Plus if you stop Wizard at level 4 pre-epic and take another Dwarven Defender level you get a better AB by +1...<br><br>Just doesn't seem viable at all.

A lot of stuff is missing from the build posting rules, no saves, skills, AB, AC, etc.<br><br>As said, Devastating Critical requires 25 STR, so that's illegal.<br><br>Feats are awful, you leave an open feat without taking Blind-Fight or Spell Focus or Spell Penetration? there are lots of stuff to take on a spellsword tank.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;While I have never posted before, I thought that this topic was too interesting to resist.

Damage is so-so, but AB is crap so you won't hit anything, DC is crap, spellpower is low (level of caster used to determine spellpower is 13), spell slots are just not enough. So you're a weak tank immune to critical hits, that's it.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/28/08 03:01</span></i></p>
