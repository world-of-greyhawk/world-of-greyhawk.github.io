I understand the reasoning behind doing it this way, but surely you would be better off going wizard, that way you can have access to the spells , where as you are going to be extremely limited with the spells you can use here (remember you dont choose spells on a palemaster level).<br><br>Just an observation, you might feel it better to have the higher skill levels.<br><br>Syrath

You lose tumble and UMD, but 40 skill points is  a lot for 8 AC when you will have a substantial AC from those palemaster levels anyways. Palemaster casting is bugged with bards and sorcerers in NWN so you won't gain new spells, but with wizard, you do gain the spell slots. you just need to take a late wizard level is all.<br><br>You have some wasted feats in this build as well. Mummy dust is a big waste as your greater undead will be a much stronger demilich. Anything that can kill that will shred your mummy in no time. Still spell as a bard is ok to get more use out of each of your spells, but if you go wizard you want to look into autostill to wear heavy armor. Lightning reflexes and luck of the heros could be replaced. If you drop down to 27 PM and take another wizard level, you can take that wiz level pre epic and push your last fighter level out toward level 38+ to max discipline.

Thanks for the feedback.  You can tell I don't play spellcasters. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Lightning reflexes and luck of the heros could be replaced.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Suggestions here with the replacements?  I know Mummy Dust is crap compared to Greater Undead Summoning, but it seemed like a decent RP fit.  Beside, I can't summon a demilich unless I get 30 PM levels, which costs me Epic Weapon Spec and the late discipline boost.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By sketchy_c on 08/04/04 08:59</span></i></p>

First of all, adjust your starting stats.  Knock that Charisma down to 8.  Get Int up to 19.  Get Str up to 26 and get Dev. Crit.  Take Wiz rather than Bard.  Get rid of Luck of Heroes, Combat Casting, Lightning Reflexes, Improved Combat Casting, Mummy Dust, and probably Hellball as well.  Toughness is OK since you won't have a lot of health with this character, but you could get rid of that if you needed to, and although Epic Mage Armor is nice, I don't think the bonuses stack with magical bonuses from items that you are wearing.  <br><br>Check out the Undead Lord build on the Bioware site.  The build is very similar to yours, it's Fighter 4/Wizard 6/PM 30.  I don't think it has Epic Weapon Spec, but it gets 9th lvl spells and auto-still spell 3, so it's probably worth it IMHO.  Since you're wielding a Scythe, you won't be wearing a shield, so it might be a good idea to start with a little Dex, wear light armor, buff up with an Empowered Cat's Grace, and use the feats you save from auto-still spell to buy a few more points of Strength.  With 30 PM lvls your AC should be pretty decent.
