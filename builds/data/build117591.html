This is what I came up with. I'm new to making up builds like this and would be interested in any comments or ideas.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 16:14</span></i></p>

nice build, a few changes:<br>you should take the last level as ranger to max out disc<br>and also could you add the death attack dc? <br><br>Very nice for a rp build, i wouldnt advise it for pvp though unless your looking for a noob harasser - many servers have ts, which is a shame because i like assasins <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

That being said:<br><br>- saving the last RGR level for a skill dump would be an option, yes, but it would result in you not getting Improved Two Weapon Fighting until very late in the build.<br><br>Since the build only takes 1 SD level at all and 10 Assassin pre-epic, you cannot switch that RGR level out anyway (can't take more than 10 levels of a single prestige class pre-epic). You'd need to drop an Assassin level and take a 10 RGR level to do the skill dump, which means losing an Assassin bonus epic feat and 1 on your Death Attack DC, which is no big deal though, as you can use your RGR FE feat in epic to select off the RGR epic bonus feat list. (Besides, there are a few feat choices I'd probably change in this build anyway in epic levels)<br><br>- Death Attack DC = 10 + Assassin Level + INT modifier, so: 10 + 30 + 1 = 41.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
