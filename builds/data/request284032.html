Hello, and thanks in advance to all that try and help with this. I am wanting a human Rogue/Cleric/Assassin or Shadowdancer. Dex based with Epic Dodge and AB as good as you can get it. I did a search and only found 2 builds with R/C/A and 4 with R/C/SD. I prefer my characters to have atleast 5 levels of each class that I use...atleast 10 of each would be even better. I am thinking of a Rogue 16/Cleric 14/Shadowdancer 10 build or maybe a Rogue 13/Cleric 9/Assassin 18 build. I havent been able to work out those builds yet though, so if you have any ideas on how you'd do it, I'd like to hear. Builds dont have to be uber powerful, I'm more of a role player. Thanks again.

I actually just worked out a build that I will enjoy using the 13 Rogue/9 Cleric/18 Assassin spread. This is an idea for a disciple of Mask character, forgot to mention that earlier. Anyways, if anyone wants to take a crack at building something for this, go ahead. If not, dont worry about it, i'm ok. Thanks!

The thing is regularly it's useless to take more than a single Shadowdancer level if you already take Rogue, you want Hide in Plain Sight, and that's all you need.<br><br>My advice is taking more Cleric, because most combat buffs cap at Cleric level 15, Darkfire caps until level 20, which I think it's the last one to cap, plus, you'll need the levels for spell duration.<br><br>13 Rogue levels (in order to take the bonus feats: Improved Evasion and Defensive Roll) and 25 DEX allow you to take Epic Dodge, which might be the most important feat to take. After that, you also gain bonus feats at Rogue levels 16 and 19, which makes it more worthwhile than taking Assassin.<br><br>I'm a powerbuilder, and I take you want help in making your build stronger, so I'd take a Cleric 20 / Rogue 19 / Shadowdancer 1, but I'm not very well suited to give non-powerbuilding advice.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Your build advice is great Thax. A 20 Cleric/19 Rogue/1 Shadowdancer build would be very strong. I'm not looking to use that much Cleric though. 15 could be a possibility.
