Good Job, TemplariDM! I am already a member there. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Maybe we can seize this opportunity to make some changes to the guild's rules and procedures, to improve the way it works and make it more adequate to the new forum's tools (which I know nothing about).<br><br>I have a few suggestions that IMO would better the current procedures:<br><br>1- Create the sub-forums just as they used to be, but on the Epic Character Builds forum, only moderators can post (with credits to the original builder, of course). This way EVERY BUILD will have to be approved by someone in order to get posted, and the odds of there being a new build that plagiarizes an older one would drop significantly. The Epic Character Builds posts could also each include a downloadable template for anyone that wants to test it / play it. Kinda like with the Exhaled Sorceress, Magical Marauder, Undead Lord, Dragon Savant, etc...<br><br>2- The builds could be discussed in the Build Request forum, which could be renamed to Build Request / Discussion forum. This sub-forum could be the most active one, where people exchange ideas and where OP's get their suggestions before deciding on a final version to present to a moderator for postage, along with a template. This would avoid what happened to me when I started in this guild and wasn't aware of many NWN secrets that I now know. The first few builds I made were so horrifyingly awful that every single one of them ended up being COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from the original one after you guys pitched in your comments. Nowadays I don't think it'll happen to me again, but we gotta assume there'll be new members coming in, even if not at the same rate and speed as before, and they could run into the same trouble.<br><br>3- We could create a backup file with every build posted in this guild so that we're prepared to save all the builds in case something like this ever happens again. <br><br>What do you guys think?<br><br>Take it EZ!
