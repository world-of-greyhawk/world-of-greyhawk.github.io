Iconic Barbarian - Barbarian(40)<br><br>DISCLAIMER: English is not my first language, so pardon the expressions <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br><br>Build Purpose: This is "Pure Build" and at the same time this is "Iconic Build" in the sense that my selections of race and feats were biased by the thoughts what a true barbarian must be. This is not "the best barbarian build", but rather "the barbarian build".<br><br><br>Race: Half-Orc<br>Alignment: Any Non-Lawful<br>PvM<br>Playable Range: 1-40<br><br>STR: 20 (26)<br>DEX: 9<br>CON: 17 (22)<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 6<br>CHA: 6<br><br>Hitpoints: 760<br>Skillpoints: 86<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Reflex/Will): 28/15/15<br>Saving Throw bonuses: +5 vs Traps<br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 41 (melee), 29 (ranged)<br>AB (self-buffed): 47 (melee)<br>AC (naked/mundane medium armor/mundane heavy armor): 11/16/19<br><br>Skills:<br>Discipline 43(51)<br>Intimidate 43(51)<br><br><br>01: Barbarian(1): Toughness*<br>02: Barbarian(2)<br>03: Barbarian(3): Weapon Focus: Greataxe<br>04: Barbarian(4): CON+1, (CON=18)<br>05: Barbarian(5)<br>06: Barbarian(6): Knockdown<br>07: Barbarian(7)<br>08: Barbarian(8): CON+1, (CON=19)<br>09: Barbarian(9): Improved Critical: Greataxe<br>10: Barbarian(10)<br>11: Barbarian(11)<br>12: Barbarian(12): CON+1, Power Attack, (CON=20)<br>13: Barbarian(13)<br>14: Barbarian(14)<br>15: Barbarian(15): Cleave<br>16: Barbarian(16): CON+1, (CON=21)<br>17: Barbarian(17)<br>18: Barbarian(18): Great Cleave<br>19: Barbarian(19)<br>20: Barbarian(20): STR+1, (STR=21)<br>21: Barbarian(21): Mighty Rage<br>22: Barbarian(22)<br>23: Barbarian(23)<br>24: Barbarian(24): STR+1, Epic Skill Focus: Intimidate, Terrifying Rage, (STR=22)<br>25: Barbarian(25)<br>26: Barbarian(26)<br>27: Barbarian(27): Epic Damage Reduction I<br>28: Barbarian(28): STR+1, Epic Damage Reduction II, (STR=23)<br>29: Barbarian(29)<br>30: Barbarian(30): Epic Damage Reduction III<br>31: Barbarian(31)<br>32: Barbarian(32): STR+1, Armor Skin, (STR=24)<br>33: Barbarian(33): Overwhelming Critical: Greataxe<br>34: Barbarian(34)<br>35: Barbarian(35)<br>36: Barbarian(36): STR+1, Devastating Critical: Greataxe, Thundering Rage, (STR=25)<br>37: Barbarian(37)<br>38: Barbarian(38)<br>39: Barbarian(39): Great Constitution I, (CON=22)<br>40: Barbarian(40): STR+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Greataxe, (STR=26)<br><br>*Toughness is chosen only because of it's "iconicity". Barbarians are tough, right? The best pre-epic feat for barbarian would be Heavy Armor Proficiency, but it's just not "iconic" enough. <br>Choose what your conscience tells you.<br><br><br>Pros and Cons<br>-------------<br>+The build has all barbarian features, including Mighty rage (that stacks with great rage)<br>-Low AC (but that's ok for iconic build, right? We are proud to wear battlescars)<br>-Low Saves (but that's ok for iconic build, right? We smash things but shun magicks)<br><br><br>Build Guidelines<br>----------------<br><br>Race:<br>Half-Orc is iconic race for barbarians (they have barbarian as favored class, you know).<br><br>Feats Selection:<br>Trying to create a barbarian with all the iconic features, I decided to include following feats:<br><br>1) Mighty, Terrifying and Thundering Rage: No barbarian can be iconic without all the rages, right?<br>2) Devastating Critical: Who is the guy born to cleave people in halves, if not the barbarian?<br>3) Epic Damage Reduction: Barbarian has innate damage reduction, so Epic DR seemed iconic.<br><br>Feats Order:<br>I tried to arrange feats so that to acquire barbarian-specific feats earlier.<br>Mighty Rage at lvl 21, Terrifying at 24, DR at lvls 27-30<br><br>Abilities:<br>The aforementioned feats require 25 STR and 21 CON, so I decided to have 26 STR and 22 CON in my build. With little feats left for Great Ability feats, this posed other abilities to be abysmal. But hey, iconic barbarian must be dumb, right? and she can as well be clumsy...<br><br>Skills:<br>6 intelligence left no choices: Discipline and Intimidate.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 07/17/08 19:20</span></i></p>

I've never known what to reply to a Pure Build, there's not much to change on those... I guess only the feat selection. So, drop Toughness and grab Blind-Fight, but that's pretty much it.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Thanks! Blind Fight is sure a good choice.<br><br>I have found small discrepancy in my build description: it actually has 720 hitpoints WITHOUT toughness (I changed the feat but forgot to correct hitpoints).<br><br>Is there any way to edit my messages? If not, I must be very careful to avoid such mistakes in the first place...<br><br>P.S. This forum doesn't seem to have "Post Preview" option either...

Yes, being careful is required. Edit is disabled 30 minutes after posting. Ask a moderator to edit it for you, you can send a message to any of them (except griphook), or eventually they might read this topic and notice.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 05/09/08 07:26 (GMT) -- avado<br><br>THax, you know i love and respect you, right?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/17/08 15:47</span></i></p>
