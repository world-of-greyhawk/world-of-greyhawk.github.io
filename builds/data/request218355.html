Assassin gets UMD and tumble as class skills, and a few innate spells that can be pretty useful (darkness, improved invisibility, even the humble ghostly visage).<br><br>I don't understand why you aren't using an assassin level late in the build to max UMD, or tumble for AC purposes.

I guess, for him, it may be that longswords are more easily obtainable than Scims but otherwise, a Scim or Rapier would be much preferred.<br><br>Rogues get more skillpoints. They can also get Imp.

Invis, and imp invis (If I take him high enough) can really add some whallop to this concept and execution.  Darkness...

I've always prefered the longsword for teh simple reason that it is suppose to be the staple of your everyday average fighter.  It's also the better choice simple put when it comes down to gear. I must seem like I'm writing off a lot of things that way, but its quite true, let's just say I have a sword that outdoes any Scimitar in the module.   It was custom made and imported by a DM, there are no weapons with a damage yeild as high as the one I have.  Side by side with my buddy the Bard/RDD/WM with a Scimitar; he was hitting an average of 230 crits, a high of 274.

Ah, well if you have a super longsword, that's that.<br><br>As for assassin vs WM... I'd go with WM since you're a strength build with specialization.  You don't need sneak attack dice to butcher things, and the extremely pumped up AB you'll have in the end will let you fight with Power Attack on for more damage, or Expertise on for more defense, or to leverage Improved Knockdown and Called Shot heavily in your favor.<br><br>A build like 11 fighter/19 WM/10 assassin would net you +3 to your weapon of choice AB, 5d6 bonus damage from sneak attack, and plenty of fighter bonus feats while letting you do 10 fighter/10 WM to 20 for maximum BAB.  You take the 11th fighter level at 24 for EWS.<br><br>Alternately you could do fighter 10/11 assassin/19 WM for 6d6 sneak attacks if you'd rather, at the cost of 1 point of BAB.  4 assassin 6 fighter 10 WM to 20.<br><br>Or fighter 8/WM 22/assassin 10.  This would also be fighter 6 assassin 4 WM 10 to level 20, letting you get some assassin levels early.  Then you make up the lost AB point with an extra WM epic weapon of choice bonus, and gain an epic WM bonus feat.<br><br>Lots of good options there, the first choice maximizes your combat feats (making it easy for you to pick up improved knockdown or called shot) and maintains your BAB, the second choice mixes a little extra sneak attack damage dice with early assassin, at the cost of a little AB.  The third variant lets you take assassin early without sacrificing AB compared to the others, and trades a non-epic fighter feat for an epic WM feat.<br><br>I think it's very viable to go with option 2, since you'll have AB in abundance.  But you'll also have damage in abundance, you don't really need the sneak attacks.  I'd pick between 2 and 3 depending on the feats you want.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

I don't have a specific levelup for that build handy, no... just some brainstorming on options I'd take within your build specifications.<br><br>I'm actually not the biggest fan of strength weaponmasters... I feel the character ends up being too narrowly focused.  Adding assassin for the spell like abilities and skill dump opportunities brings a lot to the build, I think.  Maybe I'll try to make one up in detail when I have time later.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Here's one i worked on last night (I've been working on one of this type for a while now) which I think you might like. It's a utility Rogue/Fighter/WM build, for comparison with the above.<br><br>BTW, 11 CON is NOTHING to write home about, especially on a melee character.<br><br>The Versatile Weaponmaster - Rogue 13/ Fighter 8/ WM 19<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: any<br><br>Stats:<br><br>STR: 16(28)<br>DEX: 12(13)<br>CON: 16<br>INT: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>CHA: 8<br><br>01: Rogue(1): Blind Fight, Knockdown<br>02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Longsword<br>03: Rogue(2): Expertise, Ro: (Evasion)<br>04: Fighter(2): DEX+1, Dodge, (DEX=13)<br>05: Fighter(3)<br>06: Fighter(4): Mobility, Spring Attack<br>07: Fighter(5)<br>08: Fighter(6): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Longsword, (STR=17)<br>09: Rogue(3): Whirlwind Attack, Ro: (Uncanny Dodge I)<br>10: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Longsword<br>11: Weapon Master(2)<br>12: Weapon Master(3): STR+1, Improved Critical: Longsword, (STR=18)<br>13: Weapon Master(4)<br>14: Weapon Master(5)<br>15: Weapon Master(6): Improved Knockdown<br>16: Weapon Master(7): STR+1, (STR=19)<br>17: Rogue(4)<br>18: Weapon Master(8): Toughness<br>19: Weapon Master(9)<br>20: Weapon Master(10): STR+1, (STR=20)<br><br>21: Fighter(7): Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword<br>22: Fighter(8): Epic Weapon Specialization: Longsword<br>23: Rogue(5)<br>24: Weapon Master(11): STR+1, Improved Expertise, (STR=21)<br>25: Weapon Master(12)<br>26: Weapon Master(13): Armor Skin<br>27: Rogue(6): Epic Will<br>28: Rogue(7): STR+1, (STR=22)<br>29: Weapon Master(14)<br>30: Rogue(8): Epic Fortitude<br>31: Rogue(9)<br>32: Rogue(10): STR+1, Improved Evasion, (STR=23)<br>33: Weapon Master(15): Great Strength I, (STR=24)<br>34: Weapon Master(16): Epic Prowess<br>35: Rogue(11)<br>36: Weapon Master(17): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=26)<br>37: Rogue(12)<br>38: Weapon Master(18)<br>39: Rogue(13): Great Strength III, Slippery Mind, (STR=27)<br>40: Weapon Master(19): STR+1, Epic Toughness I, (STR=28)<br><br>Max HP: 528<br>BAB: 29<br>AB (mundane longsword): 46<br>AC (naked/full plate + tower shield): 21/32<br><br>Saves:<br>Fort: 26<br>Ref: 24<br>Will: 19<br><br>+4 vs. Spells<br><br>Skills (311 skillpoints):<br>Discipline: 43(52)<br>Tumble: 40(41)<br>Spellcraft: 18(20) &lt;-- +4 saves vs. spells<br>UMD: 41(40) &lt;-- works in multiples of 5<br>Heal: 43(42)<br>Spot: 43(42)<br><br>Intimidate: 4<br><br>Search: 20(22) &lt;-- find all non-epic traps<br>Disable Trap: 14(16) &lt;-- disable all non-epic traps with take-20<br>Open Lock: 26(27)<br>Pick Pocket: 1(2) &lt;-- lets you loot dead bodies<br><br>Gets decent HPs, a bucketload of skillpoints which can make you life a lot easier, Improved Evasion at level 32 and Slippery Mind later if you only get save boosters, no mind immunity which will make your life easier (otherwise take Crippling Strike to make your sneaks do some disabling -STR). I took Epic Will and Epid Fortitude because his saves are in the ***hole. I don't dig the whole sneak-in-plate thing but you easily have enough skillpoints to go around if you want to. You can access darkness etc through scrolls but you can just stand there, KD and whack away. With your decent AB, you should get a few through and you'll be able to land sneaks.<br><br>A good sneaky-type in plate build with style that you might want to look at is GD's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "208450", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>His Infernal Mistress - Rogue 5, Fighter 10, BG 25</a><br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

Well I think I hit upon the winner for my situation.  LEt me point out that unless your server admin give's your 4 free feat's at creation, and a signifigant stat boost(+8) You cannot pull it off otherwise.<br><br>Yes, This is an illegal build for 90% of the world. However, it will be highly effective for where I'll be playing. To give you an idea, what he'll turn out as on that server at level 40 is screenshotted from my test module and linked at the bottom.<br><br><br>__Level 1_____________________<br><br>Class:
