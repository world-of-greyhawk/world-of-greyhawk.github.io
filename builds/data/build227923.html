I would like a better balance between STR/CHA, perhaps 22 in each. This way you're only using 5 Great X feats and could pick up something like ESF: Taunt and Discipline.<br><br>A pure Paladin could opt for Great Smiting, too. You could flip your STR/CHA around and switch some of those Epic Toughnesses to Great Smiting. And AB of 38 isn't bad IMO, and can be buffed a little. It's really a shame that your Paladin doesn't even have Extra Smiting...<br><br>One way or another I'd still change one of the Epic Tougnesses for Epic Reputation and max Taunt.<br><br>There's really nothing to fix but I'm just giving you ideas as to what I think a pure Paladin looks like <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>EDIT: oh and uh start with 8 DEX and 14 INT, 1 AC for another maxed skill is quite nice.<br>_________________<br>Too long I have suffered the desert sands of time~<br>But as I drown in darkness it will release the sign~<br>My soul will leave this mortal coil of flesh and earthly life~<br>to fly into the mist of night, into the nightside eclipse~<br> - by Emperor<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 01/23/06 14:01</span></i></p>

Good point.<br><br>Initially I was trying to decide between going STR and CHA based but sicne I have played several CHA based hybrid pallys before, I opted to go STR based with this one.<br><br>Going CHA based, I could have taken great smiting feats where I took epic toughness which would have been nice <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>While taunt is a useful skill, I found it not worth investing too much in it since you won't be able to taunt a mage on your own unless you are a bard in my opinion but the current amount is enough to taunt most fighters.<br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while

I agree about subbing some Great Smite/Extra Smite feats for the Epic Toughness ones. Not sure about reducing Str for Cha, since Str also gives AB (his is pretty good already, though, so maybe if you plan to focus more on smiting). <br><br>TM

Hrmm, I think lowering CON to 10 and increasing INT to 13 or 14 should be better. Drop epic toughness 1 2 and 3, replace with Epic Constitution 1 and 2 (dont know what its called). You need Improved Knockdown!! &lt;--- its a 100% must have for me.<br><br>good work 40 levels of paladin!!<br><br>lol<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By DarkInfernoo on 01/23/06 23:38</span></i></p>

With this amount of strength and thus high AB, normal KD does fine most of the time.<br><br>As for subbing Great CON for Epic Toughness, thats impossible as on those levels I only had the choice between Epic Toughness and Epic Reputation. They are taken as paladin bonus feats<br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while
