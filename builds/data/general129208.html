At 4th I increased Strentgh.  I've also been alternating on Heal, Parry and Discipline with the remaining skill point.  Am I messing this up or is this build fixable?

Messing up, expertise (must for weapon master) requires 13 int, and you haven't got room for two weapon fighting feats.

Yeah, I learned that the hard way.<br><br>I started over and did a Fighter specializing in Greatsword.  Already in Chapter 2 and he's a killing machine.

I've been thingk about starting out as a Ranger and then going Weapon Master and then Champion of Torm.  I would sacrifice teh Ranger spells and just use the character for the Dual wield.

I don't understand the ranger class as a whole at first glance it has only one or two things going for it bane of enemies and the dual wield feats combined with stealth and a good AR.  Ranger spells are mediocre at best and not worth the wis investment unlike the paladin who gets awesome spells.<br><br>Bane of enemies looks great on paper but in practice requires a huge investment for limited returns.  I tried combining it with range attacks but compared to a rogue archer or reliable archer build it is really sub par.  I also tried combining it with weapons master class abilities and found it lacking compared to other weaponsmaster builds. they have Low saves and no evasion abilities and 0 demage reduction options unless you jack constitution.  I just don't see the ranger offering much from a powergaming perspective I played one through the single player game and had some fun but trying to make a competitve PvP build out of one is a nightmare.  I desperatly wanted to make a build using it but almost every concievable combo or pure class build has more to offer.  Sorry for going off topic and ranting alittle just getting frustrated hehe
