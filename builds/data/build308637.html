The Lawnmower – Ranger (35), Shadowdancer (1), Fighter (4)<br><br>The brids were chirping, the bees buzzing, when the lawnmower went to mow the lawn.  After going back and forth in his skivvies, he spotted a zombie.  “Hmm… well this doesn’t belong, let’s get rid of it.”  So quite instinctively he began to fight it.  Moving along a little further, he spotted a wyrmling.  “Hmm… well this doesn’t belong, let’s get rid of it.”  After that fight he continued to mow he spotted a wererat.  “What is this, some kind of prank?” he hollered, and immediately began to remove the threat.  It wasn’t that much longer before he spotted a fire elemental.  “With that much fire, it’s a wonder why the entire lawn isn’t in flames.”  Looking up he spotted a giant staring down.  “What is this, some kind of party?” He was about to take care of the problem until he saw a minotaur bashing down the wooden benches.  “Doesn’t anyone care about this place?”  To his surprise a tin woodman answered “If I only had a heart.”  “A construct? This is it.  Time for some yard clean-up.  I have to mow the lawn.” So quickly he hastened to clear all the creatures off.  “Whew that was close.”  “Yes very,” replied a lizardfolk tribesman mounted on an androsphinx holding out a whisp as if it were a crystal ball.  “Not this again,” chortled the lawnmower.<br><br>Human, Any Alignment<br>PvM  (1-40)<br><br>STR: 14<br>DEX: 14 (30)<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 14 <br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: <br>Skillpoints: <br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Reflex/Will): 23/28/18<br>Saving Throw bonuses: <br>BAB: 29<br>AB: 43, With two maces: 41/36/31/26/41/36<br>AC: 26 (naked)<br>+2 AB vs. 11 out of 24 favored enemies<br>Damage vs. favored enemy with mundane mace: 3d6 + 16 (main hand), 3d6 + 15 (off-hand)<br><br><br>SKILLS<br>Animal Empathy 43(42)<br>Disable Trap 5(9) (cross-classed)<br>Hide 43(53)<br>Lore 43(45)<br>Move Silently 43(53)<br>Open Lock 1(11) (cross-classed)<br>Set Trap 43 (55)<br>Tumble 20 (30) (5 points cross-classed)<br><br>LEVELING GUIDE<br>01: Ranger(1): Favored Enemy: Undead, Dodge, Mobility<br>02: Ranger(2) <br>03: Ranger(3): Knockdown <br>04: Ranger(4): Dex + 1 (15)<br>05: Ranger(5): Favored Enemy: Aberration<br>06: Ranger(6): Weapon Focus: Mace<br>07: Ranger(7):<br>08: Ranger(8): Dex +1 (16)<br>09: Ranger(9): Blind Fight<br>10: Ranger(10): Favored Enemy: Construct<br>11: Ranger(11): <br>12: Ranger(12): Improved Critical: Mace, Dex +1 (17)<br>13: Ranger(13):<br>14: Ranger(14): <br>15: Ranger(15): Favored Enemy: Dragon, Weapon Finesse <br>16: Ranger(16): Dex +1 (18)<br>17: Shadowdancer (1):<br>18: Ranger(17): Toughness<br>19: Ranger(18):  <br>20: Ranger(19): Dex+1 (19)<br>21: Fighter(1): Epic Weapon Focus: Mace, Great Dex I (20)<br>22: Fighter(2): Armor Skin <br>23: Fighter(3):<br>24: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Mace, Epic Weapon Specialization: Mace, Dex +1 (21)<br>25: Ranger(20): Epic Prowess<br>26: Ranger(21):<br>27: Ranger(22): Great Dex II (22)<br>28: Ranger(23): Bane of Enemies, Dex +1 (23)<br>29: Ranger(24):  <br>30: Ranger(25): Favored Enemy: Outsider, Great Dex III (24)<br>31: Ranger(26): Favored Enemy: Elemental<br>32: Ranger(27): Dex +1 (25)<br>33: Ranger(28): Great Dex IV (26)<br>34: Ranger(29): Favored Enemy: Shapechanger <br>35: Ranger(30): Favored Enemy: Magical Beast<br>36: Ranger(31): Great Dex V, Dex +1 (28)<br>37: Ranger(32): Favored Enemy: Monstruous Humanoid<br>38: Ranger(33): <br>39: Ranger(34): Great Dex VI (29)<br>40: Ranger(35): Favored Enemy: Giant, Favored Enemy: Reptilian Humanoid, Dex +1 (30)<br><br>Pros: Good damage for a dex-build, invisibility purge and HIPs make a nice combo.   Panther animal companion gives a good 10d6 sneak attack against creatures you knock down.  High stealth (especially when buffed in outdoor areas).<br><br>Cons: No epic dodge, nor concealment, nor UMD.  Limited casting power. No sneak attack. AB is a little low for a pure warrior type build.<br>Adjustments: You can make this a strength build instead of a dex build without any problem.  Use cat’s grace and leather armor for AC, and replace all dex increases and great dex feats with the strength equivalent.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 05/05/09 11:46</span></i></p>

Actually, the AB isn't low, it's quite decent. With HiPS it becomes quite excellent actually.<br><br>The damage is also quite doable, even on crit immunes because of the little extra strength and you EWS.<br><br>Too bad you don't get SD2 for uncanny dodge and the last Tumble skilldump, although it'll cost you 2 FE and 1 FE damage.<br><br>And the story, quite hilarious really! I actually had to read until the tinman before I caught what you were going at. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"><br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

For some odd reason I had omitted a critical skill in the build description:<br><br>Discipline 43(45)<br><br>Now the numbers add up again.

I am moving this discussion here in anticipation that the corresponding strength build posted will be deleted by a mod for being illegitimate.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; By avado concerning a strength build and this build<br><br>WWhiz, i took a look at this and the dexer and i dont get it.  I never played with bane cuz i could never get used to the extreme gimpness of the ranger class in general, and lack of powers in specific.   Ohh, you can cast Cat's grace..!  whoop eee!!   And dont even get me started on the FACT that a pretty much pure ranger HAD to take SD for HIPS!   That in itself is a crime... anyway.<br><br>Looking at this and the dexer, how is 35 ranger superior to 35 rogue?  Sure, rogue has a much nicer skill set, more bonus feats and such.  I was under the impression that these builds were about damage dealing, yet, rogue seems a much more powerful choice (albiet sneaks are required.. oh wait, why did we take SD again?)...</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>BoE works on sneak immune and crit immune,  BoE is multiplied by crit multiplier (even on sneak immune), BoE gives +2 to AB.  That said heavy ranger hits more often than rogue as long as a lot of FE feats are taken to ensure a lot of use of BoE.<br><br>As for why HIPs (assuming that is your meaning in why SD), you know full well how much that feat can be exploited, especially when invisibility purge is activated.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By WhiZard on 05/06/09 03:18</span></i></p>
