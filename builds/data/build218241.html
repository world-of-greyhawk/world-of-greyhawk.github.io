Nice build.  I have something a soft spot for barbarians, I rarely play them but they're always a blast when I do.  Xylo mad!  Xylo smash!  Raaarr!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"> <br><br>I don't see any problems with the build as-is, in a medium or high magic world greater rage will put you over the +12 cap on both stats without needing mighty rage.  That gives you some flexibility in your gear for improving your armorclass or saves.<br><br>Thundering rage would be nice for a weapon-master, but I am not sure that giving up EDR for it is a good tradeoff.  Adding overwhelming critical to thundering range to the weaponmaster's crit-related benefits would be an interesting build, but would probably sacrifice too heavily defensivley to be more than a gimmick build.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Staybeautiful, thank you for the positive feedback. <br><br>Regarding armour, the heaviest armor (magical bonus being equal) is what suits the build best. Of course, if you get lighter armor which overall (because of magical enhancements) gives you a better AC than an heavier one, then, by all means, go with the lighter one (f.e. Chain +5 is better than Plate +1 for you).<br>You might want to increase tumble ranks to 21 just for the reason of avoiding AoO while moving in combat wearing full plate.<br><br>Regarding other items that help the build there are save boosters (will especially, even better get some mind immunity), strength boosters (for AB and damage), DR and EDR items, CHA boosting gear for terrifying rage and taunt, AC gear of course. Or a friendly cleric otherwise <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  I don't remember what's available specifically in SoU, maybe someone else can help you there.<br><br>I...Samphus, for a lvl 40 build I would go with 15 Barb lvls only, the extra feat could be used for ESF: taunt, or epic will f.e. In retrospective, I would grab blind fight preepic, probably dropping toughness or iron will if mind immunity gear are common enough.<br>Fighter 5 (FTR 4 preepic)/Barb 16 is another way to go for earlier WS at the cost of losing the taunt dump at 33rd lvl and 1 point DR.<br><br>I had some good fun playing this build, especially when terrifying rage kicks in.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

thanks for the info.<br><br>does a +2 on will saves on this particular build mean that immunity to mind spells in the form of an item isnt really needed or is it still vital?<br><br>when i first played through SoU with my own character i had trouble beating the lich which steals the dark wind, with this char i annihilated him and his mini army.<br><br>currently using "Greenleaf" armour, seems pretty nifty so far.

The OC, SoU, HotU are not really challenging environments, so you can probably go without mind immunity. Fear immunity might be a good idea though. In more challenging environments (online servers or downloaded modules) I strongly suggest you to acquire mind immunity cause your will save sucks (or again, at the very least, fear immunity). Amulet of Will +x (or any will boosting gear) is an alternative if immunities are rare or not easy to acquire.<br><br>This said, if you are sure to easily get mind immunity you can skip iron will and get some other feat (blind fight). Iron will was put in to make up for the low will saves untill you get mind immunity... if you ever do.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Stand and fight, live by your heart<br>Always one more try, I'm not afraid to die<br>Stand and fight, say what you feel<br>Born with a Heart of Steel!

well sou may not be a "challenging evnviroment" but this build does have a major weakness in "Fear" so i will search for that mind immunity but will also be taking that iron will too.<br><br>decided on a head on charge into the last part of SoU and the skeletal devourers in there put fear on me and that was the end of that!<br><br>but, please dont think im moaning, i get clarity cast on me and its a killing machine, want that mind spell immunity.

I know, the low will save is the big issue of this build. That's why I consider mind (or at least fear) immunity a priority. Raging increases your will save, so activate it before challenging encounters where you know you are gonna face fear/mind effects.<br><br>IIRC, there's an easy enough to get belt that grants fear immunity (belt of the minor guiding light or something like that). A life saver, IMO.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Stand and fight, live by your heart<br>Always one more try, I'm not afraid to die<br>Stand and fight, say what you feel<br>Born with a Heart of Steel!

well the end of SoU is just about impossible for this character, i managed it in the end but it was one hell of a pain involving lots of saving and loading (rinse and repeat)<br><br>your 100% spot on about (fear) mind affecting immunity being a must.<br><br>about to start playing HoU now, hopefully ill find a nice shop where i can buy some immunity.<br><br>on the whole this char waltzed through SoU easily, lets see how it goes through HoU.

Potions of clarity will help you (unless you get dispelled) untill you get some mind immunity. Fear immunity should be easy to get, but I'm no expert of the OCs, so I can't say it for sure.<br><br>I'm glad you like the build.

You need 25 base ranks in Intimidate to be able to select Terrifying rage and you need to lvlup as a Barbarian on a feat lvl. My guess is that you forgot to put points into intimidate, which btw you should keep maxed after you get terrifying rage for maximum efficiency.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Stand and fight, live by your heart<br>Always one more try, I'm not afraid to die<br>Stand and fight, say what you feel<br>Born with a Heart of Steel!

No they don't. You get +1 AB with your WoC and a bonus feat every 3 lvls after 10th (13, 16, 19, ...). Besides you can pick a second WoC as a WM bonus feat (not the case in this build but it is a known WM exploit).
