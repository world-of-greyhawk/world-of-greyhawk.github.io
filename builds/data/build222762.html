<b>Spear Disciple (More Melee focused)</b><br><br>Ok, the previous incarnation of this build was quite heavy on the cleric to give you a better chance of resisting dispells in a PvP situation.  This one is all out PvM and a better meleer with AB and more HPs.  I've included Epic Skill Focus Discipline again because I HATE getting KDed.  The downside of this build is the lower number of caster levels, the lack in improved evasion, 10% less speed, and 1 less AC.  You get +3 ab and 40 hitpoints in return.  An slight alternative would be to drop CON down 2 and boost STR by 1, then take great strength instead of discipline focus, to give you +1 AB.<br><br><i>Human any lawful PvM Playable 1-40</i><br><br>1)Cleric(1): Dodge, Expertise<br>2)Monk(1): M: (Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist)<br>3)Cleric(2): Weapon Focus: Spear<br>4)Cleric(3): STR+1, (STR=15)<br>5)Cleric(4)<br>6)Cleric(5): Mobility<br>7)Cleric(6)<br> 8)  Monk(2): WIS+1, M: (Deflect Arrows), (WIS=15)<br>9)Cleric(7): Spring Attack<br>10)Cleric(8)<br>11)Monk(3)<br>12)Monk(4): WIS+1, Whirlwind Attack, (WIS=16)<br>13)Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Spear<br>14)Weapon Master(2)<br>15)Weapon Master(3): Improved Critical: Spear<br>16)Weapon Master(4): STR+1, (STR=16)<br>17)Weapon Master(5)<br>18)Weapon Master(6): Extend Spell<br>19)Weapon Master(7)<br>20)Weapon Master(8): WIS+1, (WIS=17)<br>21)Cleric(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Spear<br>22)Cleric(10)<br>23)Cleric(11)<br>24)Monk(5): WIS+1, Empower Spell, (WIS=18)<br>25)Cleric(12)<br>26)Cleric(13)<br>27)Cleric(14): Epic Skill Focus: Discipline<br>28)Cleric(15): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>29)Weapon Master(9)<br>30)Weapon Master(10): Great Strength I, (STR=18)<br>31)Weapon Master(11)<br>32)Weapon Master(12): STR+1, (STR=19)<br>33)Weapon Master(13): Great Strength II, Armor Skin, (STR=20)<br>34)Weapon Master(14)<br>35)Weapon Master(15)<br>36)Cleric(16): WIS+1, Great Strength III, (STR=21), (WIS=19)<br>37)Monk(6): M: (Knockdown, Improved Knockdown)<br>38)Cleric(17)<br>39)Weapon Master(16): Great Strength IV, Epic Prowess, (STR=22)<br>40)Cleric(18): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br><br>Cleric(18), Monk(6), Weapon Master(16), Human<br><br>STR: 14 (22)<br>DEX: 14<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 14 (20)<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 432<br>Skillpoints: 227<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 24/27/24<br>BAB: 27<br>AB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 28/32<br>Spell Casting: Cleric(9)<br><br>Concentration 43(45), Disable Trap 2(4), Discipline 42(58), Intimidate 4(3), Open Lock 2(4), Persuade 43(42), Spellcraft 43(45), Tumble 40(42)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/25/07 18:54</span></i></p>

I'd start with a monk level to get 8 more skill points on character creation.  You don't use monk at Level 17 so this really won't hurt you a bit.  Something like:<br><br>1 Monk 1<br>2 Monk 2<br>3 Cleric 1<br>4 Cleric 2<br>5 Cleric 3<br>6 Cleric 4<br>7 Monk 3<br>8 Cleric 5<br>9 Cleric 6<br>10 Cleric 7<br>11 Cleric 8<br>12 Monk 4<br><br>That way, you get the Tumble maxed out as early as possible while leveling but also add some skill points at character creation.  I don't think you lose anything by doing it this way.<br><br>It's a nice build.  Have you considered going Dexer with it?  You could get the synergy of your dexterity with your AB (weapon finesse) and AC, like you do with your wisdom (AC and spells).

Yeah for some reason I started with Cleric instead of monk for both builds...I think because I didn't really have anything else worth spending skill points on anyway and wanted to get the tumble AC quick.  I also wanted access to the skelly summons ASAP since it's GREAT at low levels, just buff him up and off he goes, go off and have a cuppa tea and come back to a room full of dead stuff <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .<br><br>I thought about going dexer but then you really need to go for the dual weapon feats to maintain damage and there really isn't space for that with WM.  Also, with a lot of dex I wouldn't want to go without uncanny dodge so the build becomes something else entirely.  The basic idea of the build is to have similar AC to a sword and board meleer (which when buffed is about right since with robes you have 1 less AC than with plate, you just have to make up for the lack of shield with buffs) but with all the niceities of a 2 handed weapon.<br><br>I've been playing the 1st version on the build on The Three Towns for a while now, up to lvl 36 and going strong, critting in the 180s with all my buffs up.  It actually started out as a stupid idea build but as I developed it and started playing it I realized it's a real fun build and quite powerful at the same time.

Nice build.  I have always had a soft spot for Spears.  They allow a nice weapon synergy between non-fighter classes and WeaponMasters.  <br><br>Out of curiosity, did you only take monk levels for the Tumble? I only ask because I saw  that you had your AC listed as naked and in full plate.  If it was only for Tumble, you might consider using Rogue instead. Of course with Monk you pick up Cleave for free and Evasion right off the bat, so you probably made the best choice.<br><br>Anyway, nice build. Looks like fun.

But that's not all bad, either, as it opens up the monk attack schedule.  <br><br>I'd go with the Trickery and Magic domains.  Improved Invisibility, Mage Armor, and Stoneskin are nice spells for this build.  And Ice Storm, don't forget Ice Storm.

The AC is quoted naked and with shield and plate because that's what the spreadsheet outputs <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .  For domains I took war and trickery for cats, aura of vitality, and improved invisibility.  The monk and the extra buffs from war domain are what makes the build in a lot of ways.  I'll explain: Ok the problem with 2 handed weapons is lack of AC.  Without a shield and wearing plate you have 29 ac with this build, naked you have 28 so unbuffed you loose only 1 AC from not wearing plate.  You can then buff wisdom, dex, and then cast vitality for even more dex giving you around the +8 AC you loose from no shield.  Wearing plate you'd be stuck at 29 AC with the usual cleric AC boosts, using the monk AC and buffing yourself gets you to almost the same AC as a shield user would with room for expansion though items...I went through all the buffs and the stats buffed in the last version of the build <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "220812", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>here</a>.  Things are slightly different here,  but buffed you have about 64 ab and 50(54 with haste) AC.  Going rogue would give you some nice extra skills like UMD but restrict your AC to about 43.

Another thing is that you cannot take (epic) weapon focus, improved critical, (epic) weapon specialization or Weapon Master class with magic staves. It IS unfair, but that's the way things are.
