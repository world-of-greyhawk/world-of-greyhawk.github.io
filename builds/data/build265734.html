Endures high amounts of damage, deals high amounts of damage and can still use a few buffs, the Woodland Dwarf strives for power and defense, very playable on any environment and an excellent ally on any team.<br><br>As any Dwarven Defender, its physical defense and HP are both high, attempting to increase damage as much as possible and still keep a decent DR, I added Ranger's Bane of Enemies for the great damage it gives, and fighter as usual, to net bonus feats and EWS. Even being a Dwarven Defender with EDR III the Woodland Dwarf can deal big amounts of damage, 29-49 buffed without magic items.<br><br>Alignment: Any lawful<br><br>Playable Levels 1-40<br>PvM and PvP<br><br>Dwarf<br><br>Stats:<br>STR 15 (24)<br>DEX 14<br>CON 17 (21)<br>WIS 14<br>INT 10<br>CHA 6<br><br>1 Ranger1 - Favored Enemy I, Luck of Heroes<br>2 Ranger2<br>3 Ranger3 - Toughness<br>4 Ranger4 - STR +1 (16)<br>5 Ranger5 - Favored Enemy II<br>6 Ranger6 - Dodge<br>7 Ranger7<br>8 Dwarven Defender1 - CON +1 (18)<br>9 Dwarven Defender2 - Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br>10 Dwarven Defender3<br>11 Dwarven Defender4<br>12 Dwarven Defender5 - CON +1 (19), Knockdown<br>13 Dwarven Defender6<br>14 Dwarven Defender7<br>15 Dwarven Defender8 - Blind-Fight <br>16 Dwarven Defender9 - CON +1 (20)<br>17 Dwarven Defender10<br>18 Ranger8 - Improved Critical: Greatsword<br>19 Ranger9<br>20 Ranger10 - CON +1 (21), Favored Enemy III<br>21 Fighter1 - Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword, Epic Damage Reduction I<br>22 Fighter2 - Epic Damage Reduction II<br>23 Fighter3<br>24 Fighter4 - STR +1 (17), Weapon Specialization: Greatsword, Epic Weapon Specialization: Greatsword<br>25 Dwarven Defender11<br>26 Dwarven Defender12<br>27 Dwarven Defender13 - Epic Damage Reduction III<br>28 Dwarven Defender14 - STR +1 (18), Epic Prowess<br>29 Ranger11<br>30 Ranger12 - Great Strength I (19)<br>31 Ranger13<br>32 Ranger14 - STR +1 (20)<br>33 Ranger15 - Favored Enemy IV, Great Strength II (21)<br>34 Ranger16<br>35 Ranger17<br>36 Ranger18 - STR +1 (22), Great Strength III (23)<br>37 Ranger19<br>38 Ranger20 - Favored Enemy V<br>39 Ranger21 - Bane of Enemies<br>40 Ranger22 - STR +1 (24)<br><br>The spread can also be made with all Ranger pre-epic to get Bane of Enemies fast at level 21, and a decent Animal Companion in the low levels, but I find DR soon much more playable, you'll be invincible at early epics.<br><br>Skillpoints: 136<br>Discipline 43 (50)<br>Disable Traps 1 (3)<br>Set Traps 13 (15)<br>Tumble 20 (22)<br>Listen 39 (41)<br><br>Saving Throws: <br>Fortitude: 30 <br>Reflex: 19<br>Will: 23<br><br>HP: 668<br>AC (Naked/Heavy Armor): 15/23 (10 Base +1 DEX +4 Tumble)<br>BAB: 30<br>AB: +41 +2 vs Favored Enemies<br>Damage: 2d6 +16 (18-28) +2d6 +5 vs Favored Enemies (25-45)<br>DR: 18/-<br><br><b>Buffs:</b><br>Defensive Stance: +2 Strength, +4 Constitution, +2 resistance bonus on all saves, +4 dodge bonus on AC.<br>Aid: +1 AB, +1 to saves, +1d8 HP<br>Blade Thirst: +3 Enhancement<br>Protection from Elements: 30/- elemental damage resistance up to 40 damage.<br>Freedom of Movement<br><br><br>The only build with the same classes in the index is <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "220833", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Elfbane (Ranger 29 / FTR 6 / DWD 5)</a> by mphacon, but it's way far from being similar.<br><br><br><i>Fixed ST typo - Kail Pendragon</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 02/10/07 09:01</span></i></p>

It seems like definitely a good build.  But one thought, perhaps replace Favored Enemy V with Epic Weapon Focus, and take a Great CON feat in its place?  I suppose that depends if you'd prefer the 1 fortitude save and 40 HPs over the favored enemy. <br><br>But a very nice combo. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

I was almost certain if you took Ranger levels 5, 10, 15, etc. post-epic the Favored Enemy feats could be replaced with the Ranger epic bonus feat list such as Epic Weapon Focus.

Nope, as for description, you get Favored Enemy at level 1 and multiples of 5, but it doesn't works as a bonus feat in the sense of choosing a feat.

Correct.  Rangers can choose from their Epic Bonus Feat pick list in Epic on an FE level.  Additionally, Rangers can choose a Greater Spell Focus on an FE level pre-epic, assuming they have Spell Focus.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

If you can live without 3/- DR, you can just go Ranger26/Ftr4/DwD10.  This would net you 2 more feats (you lose the DwD bonus feat, but you gain 3 from Ranger23, 25 and 26.)  Probably would free up a general feat for that elusive Great Con feat that you were searching for as well.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Nice variant, +2 feats and +1 damage vs Favored Enemies, however, what 2 feats would you choose? for me, 2 feats will most probably be used to move Bane of Enemies and Epic Prowess into bonus feats freeing regular feats for 2 Great STR, or Great CON with Armor Skin. I don't believe that can surpass the bonus from 3 DR, more Favored Enemies could be considered though.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/13/07 04:23</span></i></p>

Heh, I know how much you like your DR, and agree you don't need 40 hps or +1 fort at the cost of an FE, but just a thought for you (i.e., if wanted to get all 7 playable races in as yer FEs). If you were to drop DD to 10, losing *gulp* the 3 point DR bonus, and 1 bonus feat (i.e., EP), and pick up ranger to 26 instead, you'd gain three feats, one at 23, 25 and another at 26, thus all 7 races covered under bane, w. one more (for ie, EP or otherwise from the epic ranger's bonus feat list). <br><br>Either way, 'tis a cool build, Thax! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     <br><br>Edit: Oops: guess I'm just echoing the Dwarflord (sorry 'bout that, didn't see you up there -- and aye, tis a good thought, indeed: but once again, and either way, good job, Thax (and unique!)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 02/16/07 19:52</span></i></p>
