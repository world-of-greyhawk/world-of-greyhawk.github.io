Rapid Shot gives another attack at max AB(-2 ofc), not at lowest AB. I'm not sure if Haste on top goes down -5 from that or gives a third attack at max AB like it should.<br><br>You could drop lingering song since you eventually end up with lasting inspiration, and thus get cursesong pre-epic to free an epic feat slot. The +5 duration is nice while levelling, but not really necessary since you get a lot of bard levels really early.<br><br>Why do you pick Half Elf over Elf? The extra Dex and keen senses is more than enough to choose Elf.<br><br>Your damage isn't bad, number of attacks and AB taken into consideration. Arrows + 10, Warcry and bardsong all help. <br><br>You should also consider Called Shot, it's a decent feat in an archer.<br><br>All in all a pretty good and straightforward bard-archer build.<br><br>You do have 1 lvl to play with also, which screams Shadowdancer. You even got room for it. Drop Lingering Song and Toughness for Dodge and Mobility. That does mean you have to let Called shot stay out and cursesong be taken as it is, but it's POWERFUL!<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

Oh, I didn't read the description that closely, just figured it was like flurry of blows. Makes it more worthwhile tho.<br><br>Lingering song was taken to ease leveling yes, but as it gets quite an amount of songs a day I guess its not important, just helpful. Could drop that for curse song. Actually I didnt think of that. I even forgot that I took curse song as I was writing down my thoughts at the end. My bad.<br><br>I wanted Toughness as this build is really starving on HPs, even thought it is ranged and all, I just didnt like the idea og having &lt;300 hps on lv 40.<br><br>I'm not sure why I took half-elf, it started as elf, and I changed it during the process for some reason and when I looked at it in the end thinking to change it back, I couldn't end up with the same stats with the feat selection I worked so long on getting right. So I guess that could be done. <br><br>If I were to take shadowdancer that means postponing lasting inspiration to lv 39 and dropping UMD and Discipline/Spellcraft to put points in hide and move silently. It is fully possible, but that makes it less leveling friendly (even tho you get great hide/ms and HiPS to compensate). You could take SD at lv 21, then moving the last bard level (and lasting inspiration) to lv 39. Also to qualify for SD I can't take finesse, leaving the build with no melee ability. HiPS should compensate for that tho.<br><br>Take elf and drop Charisma one point and start at 18 dex instead. Drop Lingering song and take point blank shot at lv 1, and weapon finesse at lv 6 . Toughness can be dropped for Called Shot if you like. Epic Prowess is dropped for another great Dex feat, and take Cha instead of Dex on lv 28, leaving you at 16 Cha in time to get lv 6 spells and a net of +1 AC and reflex with no loss of AB.<br><br>SD path: drop lingering song for point blank shot and take dodge at lv 6. Drop toughness for mobility and swap discipline and spellcraft/UMD for hide and move silently. Take SD on lv 21 and 22 and push the last Bard level to lv 39 for lasting inspiration and a skill dump, swapping the Great Dex feat from 39 to lv 30. (all tho other changes from above also apply)<br><br>SD path vs. original path:<br><br>SD: <br>Pros: gets HiPS and stealth, essentially removing the need for a melee presence and much defensive capacity. Also gets evasion and uncanny dodge, making use of all that dodge armour and reflex saves.<br>Cons: Low hps, no melee, very late lasting inspiration. Will get in trouble vs. some spellcasters with so ref-save spells. One less AB and damage that the original (same as first edition wich is still good)<br><br>Original:<br>Pros: Gets a melee presence in case of surprises/lack of ammo etc. At least some HPs in case of spells and spellcraft to make the save. One more AB and damage. Lasting inspiration earlier.<br>Cons: No stealth ability, leaving it exposed and in danger of spells (lack of evasion).<br><br>All in all the SD path is much more powerful and versatile, even if it is extremely frail. It really cries for some Con boosts, but other than that, it seems quite solid. A glass cannon is still a cannon as long as nobody gets close to shatter it.

Though, for some people, it is impossible to play any build to 40!  I remember playing with a guy one time who knew his stuff.  I asked what he was playing and he told me Dexer.  Yet, he hadnt taken Wpn Finesse yet!  WHAT!  And we were about lv 18ish at the time.  For many, taking finesse that late would mean the build is not playable, but when you are good, it doesnt matter!  Unfortunately, i was in the former group with all cept clerics (yes, i was the guy that made the "pure" clerics with lv 6 spells to lv 30 just to get dev crit early!).

This build is very dear to me. I am a lover of elves, and a lover of bards. I also solo a fair bit.<br><br>Bard/SD/AA is quite a powerful and fun combination, and i have used this combo for quite some time in a number of mid magic settings. I like to think that this is the real thinking-person's toon. I'm guessing that in a Low magic setting this build shines, and it may even be worth going for level 6 spells with dirge and mass haste. <br><br>Alternative posted here: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "16203", "315799", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br><i>*EDIT* It's not legal, or evn well behaved, to post a complete build of your own in anothers build thread.
