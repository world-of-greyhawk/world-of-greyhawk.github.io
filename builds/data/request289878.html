Hey guys, I'm too lazy to do the math in my head, and don't have an NWN to test on atm, so...<br><br>For a smiter build with at least 15 Pally lvls, and at least 15 CoT levels, what's the best split to get the most feats?  I was thinking 15 Pally 22 CoT 3 Rogue.  I want at least 12 base INT and 14 base STR (and 14 WIS ofc), so that leaves me with either A) 17 base CHA, 10 base CON, and 13 INT (enough for IKD), or B) 16 base CHA, 12 base CON, and 12 base INT.  IKD isn't really a must on the PW I'm playing it at.<br><br>I just really wanna know which gets the most feats, playability, etc., isn't really a problem.<br><br>Thanks in advance, guys!<br><br>Edit: The bonuses from 20th CoT level aren't really needed.  Feats aren't a huge problem, but IIRC, I need at least 2 CoT pre-epic to get the feats I want.  If not, I could sacrifice one (if it means an extra great smite feat, or epic feat).<br>_________________<br>For the Bioware joke of the day, press Ctrl + W.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By mantis3 on 01/05/08 08:36</span></i></p>

You guys sure are helpful. xD<br><br>And Fighter isn't wanted, as A) it lacks saves, B) it lacks Divine Wrath, and C) it doesn't add to my smite dmg. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   <br><br>Edit: And Thaxll'slkmlkklmckl, I'm making it for a friend, who's incompetent when it comes to NWN. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>For the Bioware joke of the day, press Ctrl + W.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By mantis3 on 01/07/08 03:24</span></i></p>

Just who are you talking to? I don't see any "Thaxll'slkmlkmklml", you should read my signature for further addressing me.  <br><br>Well, I'm not much into smiters, I can tell you that I'd go Paladin 19 / Champion of Torm 18 / Rogue 3 or so... considering a Human gets 8 feats I'd take Blind-Fight, Weapon Focus, Power Attack, Divine Might, Knockdown, Improved Critical, Improved Critical, Divine Shield. You have 7 epic feats and 7 CoT feats of which 5 could be pre-epic. I always try to get Great STR VII (or VI if the max STR ends in odd numbre) and use the CoT feats for Epic Weapon Focus, Epic Prowess, Armor Skin and Great Smiting or take back as pre-epic feats to free for Toughness, Extra Smiting, Extra Turning. Change Great Strength for Great CHA if you feel like it, but I'd take STR to get AB.<br><br>Anything near that would get similar stats... you know, BAB 30 or 29, your skill set and good saves. As for AB it will depend on if you're increasing STR or CHA, your starting stats are hard to manage anyway, I always go for STR over CHA, but for a smiter don't ask me, you'll have to do that yourself. STR based is much more playable.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 01/07/08 05:11</span></i></p>

I just need to know which combination gets the most combination of epic feats, keeping in mind, that the sooner I hit 25 base CHA, the better (so I can begin taking Great Smite).  I know the stats, for the most part. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Guess it's time to install NWN on this PC then, and do some testing...<br>_________________<br>For the Bioware joke of the day, press Ctrl + W.
