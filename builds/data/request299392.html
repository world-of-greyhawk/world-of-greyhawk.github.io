So, I was thinking the other day...<br><br>How would the characters Ganondorf and Link, from the Zelda series, look like as DnD characters?<br><br>Ganondorf could be.. a wizard.. but he uses a sword too. And most of the servers I play on are very-low magic level 30 max level environments. And it seems to be impossible to make a 1-30 playable Spellsword.<br><br>Link would be easier. Maybe a Half-Elf Arcane Archer, who mainly focuses on melee but the AA levels boost his ranged.<br><br>I dunno.. just a few thoughts. Anyone like to add anything?

Ganondorf becomes a giant minotaur when he becomes Ganon, so try a Sorcerer / Druid / Shifter, I don't know if you'll get it to good stats with 30 levels though.<br><br>Link is more of a sword user than an archer, ok, Arcane Archer is a nice class to make arrows hit hard... make it dex based so he can use both, but he's also the type of guy who uses a lot of weapons and helpful items, make him take at least a Rogue or Bard level for UMD.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Yeah Link is more of a swordsman..<br><br>That's a cool idea for Ganondorf.. dunno if I could pull it off though.<br><br>Here's an idea I had for Ganondorf.. took BG and Assassin to give the illusion that he's a powerful spellcaster..

You say Ganondorf is a wizard who uses a sword, and you play on a low-magic world? The answer is obvious: melee mage.<br><br>For Link, I picture a DEX-based Rogue 6/ Bard 18/ Fighter 6, with R4 / B12 / F4 at level 20.<br>_________________<br>Great Research Tools:<br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWNWiki</a><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">NWN Epic Character Build Search Engine</a><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/" target="_blank">The NWN Vault</a>

You could also go with a Cleric/Fighter for Ganondorf, use Harm, Storm of Vengeance, Implosion, those work as evil spells alright. Blackguard sounds nice, but Assassin not so much, he's nowhere near sneaky.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

I know this hasn't been posted in for a LONG time.. but<br>I am here to unveil the ultimate Ganondorf build!
