hey there.<br>i have come up with a Bard21/Fighter13/Weapon Master7, dex based and dual wielding.<br>since on my server there are a lot of weapons with bonus damage and massive criticals around, the damage from two more extra attacks outweighs the damage bonus of a strenghter.<br><br>with bard song/curse song, improved expertise, mage armor und dex-bonus i end up with a really nice AC and AB.<br><br>my only problem is that i dont have uncanny dodge, and i am not sure if this will ruin the build in PvM (i don't plan to do <i>any</i> PvP!).<br><br>because of my high AC and 50% concealment, most enemies will only knockdown me on a natural 20, and still then i have discipline backed up with a high level bard song skill bonus.<br>spring attack negates AoO when i'm moving around, and because i am an elf i am immune to sleep, and i dont know of any mob that entangles.<br><br>well, what's your opinion?<br>with the given information, is uncanny dodge crucial?<br><br>greetings, <br>dusty<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By dust7 on 04/09/07 13:49</span></i></p>

If you fight more than one enemy at a time, you'll find problems.  However, if you have a high enough AC even without the +Dex to it, then you're fine.

Uncanny dodge is probably more essential than Epic Dodge in this case. Assuming you are wearing light or no armor and relying on your dex for AC, then you may get into big trouble if you go flat-footed for some reason during combat (like getting a kill and auto-targetting something out of range, or having a henchie get in your way, etc.). If you are still wearing heavy armor, then it probably doesn't matter. ED would be nice, but it isn't crucial. <br><br>Of course, if the weapons have massive crits already, you could drop WM, and take 10 SD  or 13 Rogue instead to get HiPS and ED.<br><br>TM

I don't know where I got that impression.  Still, there are lots of ways to become flat footed, not to mention the occassional instance where you just fall out of combat.  I was mistaken when I said multiple opponents would result in such a problem, though.

Being flanked doesn't make anyone flat-footed. It makes you flanked! You still have your DEX-bonus etc even though you're swamped.
