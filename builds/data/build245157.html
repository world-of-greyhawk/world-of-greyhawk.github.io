In the future please use the format in the sticky at the top of the forum... or look at most of the other posts here for an example.  Leave the skill information out of the build's line-by-line, particularly, it makes it really hard to read <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br>Suggestions -<br><br>1 - Be a dwarf.  You have extra skillpoints and you don't need charisma.  You'll gain hitpoints, saving throw bonuses, and a nice suite of other racial bonuses.<br><br>2 - Consider dropping str to 16 at the start.  Not critically necessary as raising dex to 14 is wasted in a plate build, but it will give you the chance to raise con by 2 as well.  A great strength feat will be freed up, consider putting it towards saving throws (epic fortitude, IMO).<br><br>3 - Consider doing other things to make your saves better.  Your will save is a lost cause but fort and reflex aren't.  If you switch from using an exotic weapon to using a martial weapon (say, scimitar), you'll free up a preepic feat that you can put a saving throw feat into.<br><br>4 - You're taking epic toughnesses that you shouldn't.  You can get a bit more out of your build if you change Epic Prowess and Armor Skin from character feat levels to WM bonus feat levels and take Great Strength in their place.  Anywhere you see an epic toughness you should look for a way to replace it with something better.<br><br>Overall a good WM build.  With a little tuning like this he'll be quite fearsome.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Format was fixed for readability issues. Please keep the skill by lvl listing separate from the general leveling guide (the one with classes, feats and stat bumps). To get an idea of what I mean take a look at the posts of our most experienced builders.<br><br>I'd actually go with WM 28/Rogue 2 and get a second weapon of choice probably. Bastard sword (style issues apart for some) is no big improvement on longsword  and the latter are more common/better usually. I'd probably go with battleaxe or warhammer though, for the higher crit multiplier. Heavy flail as a second weapon of choice wouldn't be a bad idea either.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail

On a normal hit, no crit, it averages 1 more damage pr blow. Less than WS. Your calculations assume you crit on all your threats. You won't. They also assume you fight only low AC opponents. You won't. They also assume you are never fighting anyone with any DR, or ever get elemental damage in the weapon. These things all tip the scales in favour of the battleaxe. That aside, all you do is spend 1 feat for more 1 more <i>average</i> damage than the longsword. Might be worth it, might not. If you want it for style, that's fine. If you have nothing better to spend a feat for, thats fine too. But I will agree it's not worth it for power.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.
