First of all, i want to say is that there are some fantastic builds posted. Prehaps one of you pros could help me find a certain build? I play on a server that you need high AC and a decent AB. The NPC's have very high AB. It is a farily low magic server thou. There are lots of +4 and +5 items as well as crafting stations to increase that. What would be a good build?<br><br>Scott, newbie to this.

Any race requirement? Have any of the classes on your server been nerfed? Are there any classes that you definately dont want to use? When I hear high AC and decent AB I think of Fighter/Bard/Palemaster. What do you consider high AC and AB to be?

Nerfed is where certain spells or skils have been decreased., for example HiPs maybe not be used on certain servers, power of spells decreased from say 10d6 to 5d4 etc

I am not sure if any are nerfed. However I know the NPC's have a high AB, Seen very few NPC spell casters.
