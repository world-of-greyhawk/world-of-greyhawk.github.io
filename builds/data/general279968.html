Hi,<br><br>I was trying to make a Cleric/Master of Shrouds/Talontar Blightlord build for the PRC ECB forum, but I have a bit of a problem.<br><br>How do you cast spells from bonus domains in the PRC? I've gone into my special abilities (Cleric) and there I have options for Cast Spell Domain Slot Lvl 1-9 and so on, and there's another option to CHECK Domain Slots...but that just tells me what domains I have.<br><br>When I try to cast a spell, it says I have no Domain spell memorized for that level.<br><br>How do I memorize and how do I cast these spells??

Seeing that I am probably the only one on this forum who plays prc, i will take a go at it.<br><br>The unfortunate part is, the pw I play on doesnt use the3rd class you refer too, so I cannot comment specifically on it.  I do know there are some classes that have spells as part of the Feat menu, which are accessed via the rotational spell menu.  With clerical domains (agian, you appear to be using 3.0, I am using 2.2 prc on the pw i play) the cleric domain spell are found under the spell level that they should be in.  I was just messing around with a Darkness domain cleric that gets Power word Kill and stun, and both are under the spell menu.<br><br>Other than that I cannot answer.
