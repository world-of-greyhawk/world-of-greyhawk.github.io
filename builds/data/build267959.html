Not bad.  Can't complain about a good ranger.  As always, watch out for modules or PWs which prevent the use of Dev Crit.<br><br>The one thing which bugs me is waiting sooo long for BoE.  Push back your Bard and RDD levels by one, put a Ranger level there and grab it right away.  Then switch AS towards later.  I know that damage is not a concern with this much strength, but the immediate 2d6 is a big jump in comparison.  And it makes the ranger FE really worth while.  Why wait till the end for something which is easily attainable right away.  Dev Crit, if delayed, isn't the end of the world, since it takes its time to get there anyways.<br><br>Well, just my ranting.  Ignore as needed.

a good point well made christian/ mantis. I had missed that entirely for some reason.<br><br>I will update this following any further comments made.

One more thing:  I don't think you net too much from extend spell, as your short turn buffs already will last 26 turns.  Perhaps picking up exotic proficiencies and focusing in kukris would be more favourable?  Really a personal call, but I prefer the threat range of the kukris. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

Hmm... fair point. <br><br>It was only there to give a better duration for all round/ level based spells (eg. Blade Thirst, Grease, etc.). But I would agree with you I think.<br><br>Not sure I would opt for Exotic Proficiency though. Probably Disarm as it provokes an AoO even if it fails.

Samphus, I'm not sure you get Disarm quite correct.  It lets your <i>opponent</i> get an AoO against <i>you</i>, which is always undesirable unless you have a damage shield up.  This build doesn't get Wounding Whispers, so Disarm would only be useful if you actually want to disarm an opponent.<br><br>Early AB will be heavily influenced by Weapon Focus, yet you take Cleave very early.  I'd take WF and Power Attack at creation, Cleave at level 3, and Blind Fight at level 6.  Of course, such early levels are really rather trivial on most servers.<br><br>A note to those not familiar with Rangers: 2 Great Strengths are OK, netting 1 more damage and AB, but a really nasty option would be to take more Favored Enemies, depending of course on the server.  Expanding BoE seems to me way more useful than simply 1 more damage/AB.  And since the same could be said of my Dancing Blades build... maybe it's time I made some tweaks!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

Johann.... thanks for that. I am trying to remember just what the hell I was thinking.<br><br>As for PA and Cleave straight off the bat, I have found it much better at lower levels than another 1 to AB from WF. Particularly when you run into low level encounters with 2+ enemies. Your AB at that level is enough anyway in the main, but getting that extra blow in when you fell one enemy often helps me get through the encounter that much more safely. At the end of the day it is down to preference as all three feats are in the build anyway.<br><br>As to the Great Strength Feats, I am with you on the option of taking two further Favored Enemies instead. You still maintain a high unbuffed AB and wonderful damage output.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 03/20/07 10:21</span></i></p>
