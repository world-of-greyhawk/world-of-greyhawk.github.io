(If you loathe powerbuilds then I suggest clicking the Back button <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  )<br><br>Finally decided to put up my first epic build post here on the forums. It's a build that I came up with a few days ago and so far I've really been enjoying playing it. So I present to you:<br><br>The Draconic Warrior (Fighter 26/Bard 2/RDD 10)<br><br>Wielding two weapons and having an overall nice AC, this build can work both as a tank as a problemsolver. Note that the used weapons can be changed for something else if preferred. I just chose the bastard sword because of the looks and the feeling. Choosing the kukris instead would give a nice crit range and a low penalty to the AB when dual-wielding. The scimitar instead would give the build one more availabe feat but I hardly think it will be needed. <br><br>Start: <br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Any Non-Lawful<br><br>Str 16 (40)<br>Dex 15 <br>Con 14 (16)<br>Wis 8<br>Int 14 (16)<br>Cha 8<br><br>All stat points go to strength<br><br>Level distribution:<br><br>1-20:  Fighter,  pump Discipline to max and Lore to 8<br>21:    Bard,     max Tumble, UMD, Spellcraft<br>22-31: RDD,      max Spellcraft, Discipline<br>32-39: Fighter,  max Discipline<br>40:    Bard,     max Tumble, UMD, Spellcraft<br><br>Feat progression:<br><br>1: Exotic Weapon Proficiency, Weapon Focus: Bastard Sword, Power Attack<br>2: Cleave<br>3: Knockdown<br>4: Weapon Specialization: Bastard Sword<br>6: Ambidexterity, Two Weapon Fighting<br>8: Improved Critical: Bastard Sword<br>9: Improved Two Weapon Fighting<br>10: Improved Knockdown<br>12: Toughness, Great Cleave<br>14: Dodge*<br>15: Mobility*<br>16: Spring Attack*<br>18: Blind Fight*, Improved Initiative*<br>20: Disarm*<br><br>Ok, you might wonder why 20 fighter levels pre-epic. The answer is simple; to get the best AB possible. 20 fighter levels means 20 BAB, which is more than what you would have if you started taking the Bard and RDD levels pre-epic. <br>The feats marked with a * indicates that they can be changed without affecting the final build too much.<br><br>21: Epic Weapon Focus: Bastard Sword<br>24: Great Strength I<br>27: Great Strength II<br>30: Great Strength III<br>33: Great Strength IV, Epic Weapon Specialization: Bastard Sword<br>35: Armor Skin<br>36: Great Strength V<br>37: Overwhelming Critical: Bastard Sword<br>39: Great Strength VI, Epic Prowess<br><br>So let's see what we end up with here. <br>Final strength will be the base 16, plus the 10 from the stat progression, plus the 8 bonus from RDD and finally the six Great Strength feats. <br>So: 16+10+8+6= 40<br><br>Not too shabby, if I may say so myself <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  .<br>And then of course, both the con and int get a +2 bonus from the RDD levels.<br><br>Final AB:<br>Wielding one normal bastard sword: 49/44/39/34<br>Dualwielding two normal b swords: 45/40/35/30 offhand: 45/40<br><br>So with the +6 from strength items and a +5 weapon it will be:<br><br>One sword: 60/55/50/45<br>Two swords: 56/51/46/41 offhand: 56/51<br><br>(Choosing kukri instead would mean a +2 to all attacks)<br><br>Damage is 1-10 +21 (17-20 x2)<br>With +12 to strength, a keen sword: 1-10 +27 (15-20 x2)<br>  <br>Final HP with no gear is max: 544<br>With the +6 bonus from con items: 784<br>Naked AC is 26.<br><br>I'm open for suggestions how to improve this build even more. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   So give me your thoughts.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 20:34</span></i></p>

My only question is: Why the 15 DEX if not taking whirlwind attack? (whirlwind does take 15 DEX, right?)Why not 10 WIS at the begining?

The 15 in dex is needed for ambi dexterity if I remember correctly.

Aye, the reason why it has 15 Dex is to get ambidexterity. And I have to say, to me the whirlwind and the improved whirlwind attacks are both completely useless. I know many will disagree but I have never seen any potential in them. You sacrifice one round to do an attack at your full ab against all your opponents within reach? That's just stupid to me. There aren't that many times I've seen more than 5 or so enemies around me and those fall quite fast with 6 attacks per round and great cleave. So whirlwind is to me a wasted feat.<br><br>And why would I take 10 wisdom in the beginning? For a +1 to my will save? No thanks.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By SlimReaper on 12/28/04 11:19</span></i></p>

Might sound like a dumb question; but would it make sense to change the whirlwind feats to Focus Kukri; EWF Kukri; IMP Crit Kukri, etc?<br>Then you would wield Bastardsword in main and Kukri in offhand, thus saving +2 and keeping higher damage potential on mainhand..

Well it's a bit hard to change the Whirlwind feats to something else seeing as I never took them from the beginning <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> . But two of the several fighter bonus feats could be changed to Weapon Focus: Kukri and Improved Critical: Kukri in the pre-epic levels. And for the Epic Weapon Focus: Kukri I guess that either Armor Skin or Epic Prowess could be sacrificed.<br><br>Or even better, Epic Prowess and Armor Skin could be exchanged for Epic Weapon Focus and Epic Specialization for the Kukri.

My bad eyes sorry <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> .  Hmm.. if you swap the prowess you lose yet another bab point I think, and armor skin would be a problem if you get hit within a ratio of 2... I would kick myself if that happened <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> .  ah well..
