After really struggling with a 10 rogue 30 assassin build in a PvM setting, I added in fighter levels and improved the starting attributes to make a more effective assassin and eliminate or reduce some of the problems that that character had.  I wasn't even trying to do it, but this level pattern allows me just enough skill points to keep all of the important rogue skills maximized through the first set of assassin levels if I save enough points during each rogue level. <br><br>This build allows the assassin to stand up to a lot of improved knockdowns that would otherwise kill him or her and pushes the threshold of sneak attack damage as high as possible with the specialization feats.  The high use magic device skill, which is kept at maximum whenever possible, adds versatility to the assassin with the ability to use wands, rods, and scrolls to make his or her prey that much more vulnerable; a good assassin would not rely on his or her weapons alone to bring down their quarry.  Will and fortitude are problematic, however, so it would be a good idea to invest in equipment that improves those saves.  An item that grants Hide in Plain Sight would also be helpful, but a good rogue can easily get by without that feat.<br><br><br><i>Fixed AB figures - Kail Pendragon</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 08/09/08 11:18</span></i></p>

It's always good to welcome a new Assassin build to the guild, so welcome.  I'm just going to comment on 2 things:<br><br>1.  Your dualwielding AB at 41 looks incorrect.  A human with a 29 Dex, 26BAB and only WF/EWF should get a 38 AB just singlewielding.  Dualwielding, assuming your off-hand weapon is small, would be 36.  Unless there's something I'm missing.<br><br>2.  While I agree that an Assassin or Rogue doesn't need HiPS, I think a Dex build like this should have Epic Dodge, especially with less than 300 hit points.  With a 29 Dex, your only 3 Rogue levels away from qualifying.  I would even drop a fighter level and do something like Rogue13/Fighter5/Assassin22.  You could even drop starting Strength to 14 and raise Int to 16 so that you only really lose one Death Attack DC, but end up with Epic Dodge (and Improved Evasion/Defensive Roll).  You'd also have a lot more skill points doing something like that, and you could even cross-class Spellcraft to bolster your magic saves.  <br><br>You'd have to drop some of those ISAs, but then you could also use one more Assassin bonus feat to push your Dex up to 30 so that you get 1 more AB and AC.<br><br>Just some thoughts.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

A rapier in both hands will also give you -4 to your attack with each hand as well.

I just checked my build and it actually has 39/34/29/24 for the primary hand when wielding two +5 rapiers, so I was only off by two.  It's 41 when wielding a +5 short sword or dagger.  For this build I'd gladly give up the difference to take advantage of the rapier feats, but getting Epic Dodge in will have priority over rapier feats.<br><br>This build was designed to get Hide In Plain Sight as early as possible on modules that give it to Assassins at level 8.  Like I said, a good rogue wouldn't need Hide In Plain Sight (frankly I think it's kind of cheap to fight like that), but it's built in to the build.<br><br>I completely forgot about Epic Dodge, so I'm going to rework it into the build.  Epic Dodge can really frustrate enemy fighters whose additional attacks are less likely to hit.  If I can I'm going to try to get it for my screwed up 10/30 assassin that I only play for the awesome roleplay.  <br><br>I'm thinking about giving this build the most dexterity possible and just bringing strength down to 10 or 12 since weapon finesse takes care of accuracy and anything less than a strength mod of 3 isn't worth it for damage in my opinion.  Ending with 29 dexterity didn't seem right at all to me, but I couldn't think of anything at the time that 30 dexterity would give me (duh, Epic Dodge:roll:).  The sneak attack damage wasn't too extraordinary for a 40 level character though, even with the specialization skills which really didn't add much, plus critical hits don't stack with sneak attacks anyway.

You don't want to end with an odd DEX. You could replace one of the Great DEX feats with Epic Prowess (ending with 28 DEX), and you would lose nothing and gain 1 AB, or you could replace one of the Improved Sneak Attack feats with another Great DEX (ending with 30 DEX), and you would lose some sneak attack damage but gain 1 AB and 1 AC and 1 point on Reflex saves.<br><br>EDIT: You posted while I was typing. When you post your AB for a build, you should post it with mundane weapons (no +s on the weapon).<br>_________________<br>Great Research Tools:<br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWNWiki</a><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">NWN Epic Character Build Search Engine</a><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/" target="_blank">The NWN Vault</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Empyre65 on 08/09/08 05:18</span></i></p>
