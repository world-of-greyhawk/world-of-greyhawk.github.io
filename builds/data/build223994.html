The mountain giant was a prime example of it's own species. Big. It didn't matter that every step it took made the flubber it's body adorned ripple like water. Nor did it matter that it's stink was as thick as its wit. All that mattered was this; Iggannon needed components for his new experiment trap and this brute was in his way.<br><br>He stuck to the shadows as he pondered his options. Through the legs? A rather ghastly scene involving himself and a giant's foot passed through his thoughts. He shuddered. Perhaps he could take it on head first? His eyes slid to the large wooden squashing device in the giant's grasp. They further focused on the remnants of the last poor soul to try and pass the giant... chunks of it hanging off the splinters. Eurgh!<br><br>Then it struck him. A delighted grin curved his lips as he blindly dipped into his backpack for a trap. And what trap should he pull out but one of the best spike traps he'd ever created? Sticking to the shadows he set the plan in motion. This particular trap would take a little longer than usual to prepare. He pulled out a small leather pouch, embossed on it's front read, "Iggannon's Fantastical Fool-Proof Patented Hole Making Kit". He tipped the pouch and out fell a single solitary device, a small shovel.<br><br>In no time at all, the small hole was dug and just as quickly had he implemented the trap and covered it over with dirt. He stood up and scrutinised it, noting that it was only as big as the giant's foot. He made a mental reminder to make bigger traps. And so with the trap prepared, he needed only supply the bait...<br><br>Iggannon stepped out of the shadows, turned around and dropped his drawers. He looked over his shoulder and grinned gleefully at the giant. The brute's face screwed up in utter confusion at the sight it was presented with. It took the wiggle of Iggannon's cheeks to snap the giant out of it's contemplative state. Confusion slid to anger and it's large wooden club was raised above it's head. It stepped towards Iggannon.<br><br>He almost panicked, he didn't think they could move that fast. Two enourmous steps later and the giant trod on the very centre of the pressure pad -<br><br>The sound of a trap is almost musical to Iggannon, almost like a tribal percussion. The precise click that resounded when the pad was hit in the perfect spot. Then the mechanical clogs turning, the safety locks snapping in that split second before the coup de grace of metallic blades bursting through the dirt and finding their mark -<br><br>He shook himself out of his whimsical thoughts to find the giant in an uproar, the blades had cut right through it's over-sized foot and had incidentally lodged the entire trap to it. The foot rose immediately as the giant tried to kick the trap off and danced around in an almost balletic set of stunning (yet ground thundering) moves.<br><br>Iggannon was finding it hard to hold back the laughter shuddering through his body. But despite the giant's peril, the big mass of idiotic flesh was still hindering his path. He sobered up and furrowed his brows, pondering once again. His private thoughts were cut short when something metallic smashed on the rocks just a foot away from him. He looked down at this metallic thing with great curiosity, even went to the trouble of croucing down to take a closer look. "Yup." He thought to himself. It was definitely the trap he just set laying mangled on the ground, giant's blood staining it. And if he looked up there would be one giant with more than just a few questions on the matter of said trap.<br><br>Iggannon looked up.<br><br>The giant's face was so red, Iggannon could swear that he could see steam shooting out of it's ears. It limped towards him.<br><br>This time he really did panic. "Toblerone!" He called in a high-pitched shrill. And seemingly out of thin air a large black raven with shiny feathers black as pitch swooped in with a triumpant caw. Now, large as Toblerone was, the bird was even smaller than Iggannon. Toblerone noticed this almost instantly, put on the brakes and flapped it's wings madly as it frantically tried to go the OTHER direction. Unfortunately, the ravens efforts were cut short as the giants club made quick work of the once proud bird.<br><br>Iggannon looked on in horror. His eyes wide and layered over with tears watched his bird instantly transform into a plume of feathers which made their slow descent to rest finally in his hair. "To... blerone...?" His voice had lost it's energy and was barely a whisper.<br><br>His panic turned stricken and he thrust his hand into his pack. With no time to search he just grabbed the first scroll his hand took hold of and yanked it out. He didn't even bother to read what spell it was before he read out the incantation. Everything around him lit up with a dazzling brightness and then... that was it. In the time it took for the giant to realise what was going on, Iggannon caught sight of the title of the spell before the scroll crumbled through his hands.<br><br>Luminatis<br>The Light Spell<br><br>A booming growl blasted towards Iggannon, he looked up just in time to see the giant bringing the club down with a spectacular speed. He tumbled this way and that as the club crashed against the hard dirt. He was running out of options. He had to find another way into the cave. He ducked, almost lazily under another swipe. Maybe he could tire the giant out. A few more swipes told him that it would be some time before that would happen.<br><br>"Oh forget this!" he exclaimed and dodged to the side once more, drawing one of his daggers out. With nothing else to attack, Iggannon brought the dagger down into the closest thing he could reach, the giant's good foot.<br><br>For one heart-stopping moment he thought that the dagger wouldn't penetrate. He watched it bend but before he had time to panic once more it sank down through the hardened flesh. When he felt the hilt slam down as far as it could go, Iggannon scrambled back to see what would happen next. The giant had lost balance, and with no good foot to carry it's bulk around balletic moves turned to a drunken swagger.<br><br>Before long, the giant's heavy form came tilting down. With a loud resounding crack it's head slammed into the cliff side. Iggannon looked on curiously in the silent aftermath. The giant was leant, supposedly dead, still against the hard rock side. Iggannon edged closer. It didn't look like it was breathing. As he took yet another step forward he yelped and took three leaps back, the giant finally crumbled to the ground with a jolting thud.<br><br>Washed with releif, Iggannon smiled. The smile turned to a chuckle and soon he was roaring with laughter and dancing around in circles, hooking arms with a non-existent dance partner. "Ha!" he exclaimed as he kicked at the giant's corpse. He once again dropped his drawers and shook his cheeks around avidly at noone in particular.<br><br>After his moment of victory he retrieved his dagger and proceeded into the cave.<br><br>***<br><br>--------------------------<br><br>Not the best thing out there I'm sure, I'm a complete amateur when it comes to making builds.

Of course if there is better equipment on the server you play on then use that instead. For weapons I used two Dagger +6's. I used Robes of the Shining Hand +7 to take advantage of the zero max dex, any other type of robes or clothes may be used as long as they don't hinder your dex bonus - if you're worried about magic maybe used some higher level mage robes for the high SR. I also used Gloves of the Yellow Rose +6 for the extra AB. Cloak of Protect +6, Belt of Agility +6 and Ring of Rogue +4 for the extra AC and Reflex boost. Ammy of Natural AC +5 and Ring of Fort +6 to add a goodly chunk to fort. This is just an example of what to use - think Monk items and dex modifier boosters.<br><br>As a game plan, anything that is immune to crits or sneak attacks use your traps and scrolls/wands etc. The only problems I had was with enemies who had True Sight... and unfortunately on the PW I play on that's every second enemy ~_~. But as long as you've got a party you shouldn't have too many worries.<br><br>As for everything else, sneak up on them, IWWA and go from there. Casting Darkness and Ultravision works a treat.<br><br>Two things you'll have problems with are undead and constructs. Just use Sunburst and Crumble respectively <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>--------------------------<br>Epilogue<br><br>Iggannon arrived back home. It was always in a state of disarray. All kinds of mechanical parts and tools lay strewn on the floor and all available surfaces. He wasted no time on anything else and sat down cross-legged in his favorite working spot (the only clear space there was on the floor). He hummed a merry tune from his childhood of which he didn't know the name of, it was his favorite (and only) tune to work to.<br><br>And so the experiment began. He stayed transfixed to the spot for hours on end as he bent down over the contraption. Tinkering here, tightening that, adding this hooby-jigger to that whats-it. He really was having the time of his life. It was only until a tiny stream of sunlight shot past him through the window that he realised how long he'd been working. One more tweak and it would be done.<br><br>"There!" He smiled and held up his new creation. I think I'll call it "Iggannon's Super Ultra Magnificent All-In-One Trap." He said to noone in particular. His smile turned to a grin as he placed it back to the floor and stood up stretching his aching muscles. It had been a long night, but well worth it. He was tip-toeing through the usual mess on his way to bed when he heard the music.<br><br>This was no ordinary music. It was the tribal percussion, the click, the whirr. The explosion of fire, the whipping of tangles, the buzz of electricity the chill of ice and the hiss of smoke. <br><br>"Back to the drawing board." he thought to himself as the final boom of a sonic wave knocked him out cold.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/12/07 15:08</span></i></p>

Welcome.  Conrgratulations on your first build.  And here are your first constructive criticisms:<br><br>If you are going Dex-based, and since most or all of your damage is based on crits/sneaks, you really need Epic Dodge to keep you alive.  With 23 levels of Rogue, there really isn't a reason not to take it.<br><br>Also, I would recommend Fighter over Ranger in this situation.  With 8 levels of Fighter, you can get Ambi, TWF, ITWF and WS/EWS.  This will also open up two more levels of Rogue for 1d6 more sneak and a Rogue Bonus Feat.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Lvling is kinda difficult to read, don't write the class feats automatically acquired it just messes things up. Writing class lvls would make the build more readable too. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br>I agree with the dwarflord, I myself realized that ranger is really useful if you take a lot of levels...otherwise go fighter and grtab WS/EWS (useful to a dexer against crit immunes).<br>I'd change your starting stat to either:<br><br>STR: 12<br>DEX: 17<br>CON: 16<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>1 less dmg but +40 HP and +1 epic feat (you free up 1 great dex) ending with 28 DEX<br><br>either:<br>STR: 11<br>DEX: 19<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>You can end with 30 DEX for +1 AB/AC and you free up 1 epic feat (no need for great dex II again)<br><br>either:<br>STR: 12<br>DEX: 18<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 10<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>End with 28 DEX and free up 2 epic feats or end with 30 DEX getting both great dexes and you get +1 will saves for -1 dmg<br><br>or at least get WIS 10 and CHA 8 (+1 will saves)..you won't need CHA in this build.<br><br>Epic dodge is a must in a dex build, drop some improved sneaks and get it.<br>Also it seems to me you are missing KD/IKD and your discipline sucks, get a discipline class near the end of your career. Beter yet get fighter instead of ranger (as the dwarflord says) and move some WM preepic to raise AB...btw your ab is 43 (41 dual wielding), but you can easily squueze out +1AB (or even +2 if taking only 4 rogue preepic).<br>I'd probably go FTR 12/WM 7/Rogue 21 (can get +2AB with right pre-epic lvling) or FTR 9/WM 7/Rogue 24 (+1 AB)<br><br>Last UMD works with modified ranks in bumps of 5 (with your 10 CHA you don't need 42) and you are missing spellcraft (+1 to saves vs spells for every five modified ranks, based on INT)<br><br>I hope it helps<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Great story, decent build.  I kept thinking that he was a gnome, since he's something of a tinkerer, but halfling work just as well <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   Very entertaining.  <br><br>I agree that fighter is definitely going to give you more raw power than ranger, especially considering the +6 to damage from WS/EWS.  Epic dodge is a must for a dex-build as others have stated.  A fine first try, however.<br>_________________<br>Favorite PW's: Hall of the Worlds, Higher Ground, World of Iniquity.

Good effort, story on your first build too. I think most things have been covered; it was a little hard to read I must admit. The other advantage of taking Fighter over Ranger is that you will avoid copyright issues with you animal companion <a href="http://www.toblerone.com/" target="_blank">Toblerone</a>.

So I think it can go either way there.<br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Woah, cool. Thanks for all the responses.<br><br>Yeah, I did think about going fighter, especially for the extra feats, but as Xylophone here put it, I got better skill selection and more skill points overall (which meant that my trap and stealth skills never fell too far behind). Plus, for the sake of the character I liked having the animal companion. Add the fact that I got three Favored enemies.<br><br>It was a hard toss-up but I felt that Ranger accentuated the character's personality better. As you may have noticed I enjoy the role-play aspect more than full on power (not that there's anything wrong with that). In fact I usually do play fighter builds so this was somewhat of a first timer for me.<br><br>As for the Toblerone copyright issue... is that true or are you just yanking my chain...? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif">   <br><br>The starting stats is really the only place I wasn't sure about... I figured it might be fairly useless to have much STR seeing as weap finesse comes in quite early, but the added max weight load was a bonus I suppose... Might have a fiddle around with the stats, will try out Kail's stat changes. Or seeing as I'm sticking with Ranger I might boost the WIS and take spells... hmmm. So much to consider.<br><br>Shame about the monk gloves though, well at least that frees up an equipment spot.<br><br>Let the tweaking commence!

I wouldn't worry much about carrying capacity. Remeber you are a dexer, no 50 pounds plate to weigh you down which frees up a lot of "space" in your backpack (weight wise of course). Your 14 STR costs you a lot, being the halfling's weak stat you can surely arrange starting stats more efficiently and CHA 10 is kinda useless. If you wanna keep ranger put WIS at 12 at least so as to be able to cast those spells otherwise you are better off going fighter... oh, well, IMO you are anyhow better off going fighter but even more if you nerf your WIS and deny yourself your spell casting ability<br>Fine tuning apart, a good job<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Hrm... here's a hypathetical.<br><br>Say I was to dump WM entirely, take fighter pre-epic and take WS/EWS. Would I be about the same or better off than with WM?
