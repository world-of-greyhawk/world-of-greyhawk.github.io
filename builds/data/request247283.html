Hello. I am currently playing on The Wheel of Time server. The name of the game on this server is either Devcrit builds or Uberdexer builds. In order to earn the title of blademaster, it seems you must use either one. I am currently using a Fighter/Weaponmaster char, weapon of choice is the Bastard. 18 levels of Fighter and 7 levels of WM so far. I plan on deleveling my char in the near future way back to level 2. What I need help with is a build that can stand up to another Devcrit build and an Uberdexer build. I am not good at all creating any types of builds, so any help will be appreacited. There are requirements to this build. Must be Human, LN for alignment, I can have no RDD levels nor any caster levels whatsoever. I would like to stick with Fighter/Rogue/WM build. I searched those builds earlier and couldnt find any I liked. The server I play on is about middle magic. Not a lot but it is there. If anyone could create me a Devcrit build that can withstand just about any PvP fight, I thank you.<br>_________________<br>Let the Lord of Chaos rule

If you want to survive dev critters, you don't play a WM, you play either a high AC build or a critical immune build. Or, if autofail on 1 is turned off, a high Fortitude build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  Besides, seeing how there are 197 WM builds posted and you liked not one of them, perhaps WM just isn't your thing <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"><br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a>

Fighter8/Rogue4/WM28 is usually how people do this. You might go fighter8/WM22/CoT10 to boost your fort save at the cost of AC. Or dump the Weaponmaster and go Paladin/CoT/Rogue. Your DEV will have a good enough range with scimitar.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 03/06/06 18:56:45 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br>Trollborn Asgardian by the master of the Norse legends, Grimnir himself!<br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Damn. If LN wasn't the restriction, I would say Paladin/CoT would be your answer. They can get deathly high saves which will simultaniously give you good AC, Damage, and a Smite. Blackgaurd would also allow some decent saves if you invest into Charisma as well as Constitution. Then you can also get Divine Might and Shield to really reap the benifits of the class. Your saves could hit the 40's pretty easy, probably higher with some work. Unfortunatly though, this is apparently not an option. Lawful Neutral though, can achieve you Palemaster levels which grant Critical Immunity; though if I recall, you cannot have cast levels at all.<br><br>If you need to have Weapon Master, your AC will likely not be exceedingly high unless you went Dexterity based, but I think you wanted Strength, which I would take too. This means you won't be beating the other builds Dev-Crit with AC, so you will have to make the save. In this case, I would say CoT is your only choice. The BAB is full, which won't detract from the build. It will also increase your saves by a healthy amount (+5 I think, not counting the classes Base Saves) and give you a ton of bonus feats. This will give you the option to leave Fighter levels out of the build entirely, as you will not need the Fighter Bonus feats. I would suggest Rogue/CoT/WM for decent saves, good HP, good AB, Sneaks, Skills, and all that tasty stuff.<br><br>If I have some time, I will work out a build for you. Don't count on me though. Summer is too great to spend on the computer.

Nasty requirements, casters usually work on uberdex builds and such... I have a good build for this case, but it doesn't meets the requirements.<br><br>Anyway, Fighter8/Rogue4/WM28 sounds good, you might get more Dev Crit DC with epic Barbarian, although that's totally different, you'd get more STR for the DC, maybe something like Barbarian34/Fighter6 (not sure at which levels Barbarian gets extra feats)... although you couldn't be a good Weapon Master/Fighter/Barbarian or you wouldn't really get advantage of the extra feats.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/25/06 01:41</span></i></p>

I thank everyone that has posted on my thread. I have yet to remake my char. I am kinda dreading it. As for that person that said they could give me a step by step build that would be great but I dont expect someone to take time for that...lol Aligment can be put to LG if need be. I can change anything except my char cant have caster levels. Thanks again.

If autofail on 1 is turned off, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "200316", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>This Guy</a> shouldn't fail many Fort saves. Look a few posts down for a Dev Crit version. This is a Dwarf build, but it should be easy enough to adapt it to Human if you like.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
