How would you get the most damage reduction without being a dwarf or using spells? Preferbly in a human form.

Does anybody see it worth it taking barbarian and palemaster? Barb. for damage reduction 13/- and palemaster for immune to crits.

Yep.  I have both a fighter 20/ bard 4/ pm 16 and a barbarian 20/ bard 4/ pm 16 that I use quite a bit. With the fighter version I get all of the resist energy feats pre-epic as well, so 5 points of all the energies also get resisted.  This is especially nice on a low magic world.  Both builds also get dev crit, if enabled on the server.  It is great to be able to dev crit somebody else when they can't dev crit you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  the added little bit of DR also helps.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

That way - no crits, sure it's mediocre DR, but better than nothing.  That DwD can soak 50 points from the whirling deathmaster scythe weaponsfreak 500hp damage crit hit; but HEY! you'll effectively soak over 400hp coz you can't get critted <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> ... now that is soaking!  Add in darkvision, and a little summon for distraction...

Of course a Risen Lord DwD would drop off the crit, cut the damage in half, and then soak 24 (depending on your build) damage just with natural resists. He'd soak 474.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By yrtsns on 02/06/05 23:46</span></i></p>

True on the Risen Lord DwD, but he didn't want to be a dwarf....<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.
