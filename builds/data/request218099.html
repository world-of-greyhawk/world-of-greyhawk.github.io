I have been thinking about playing a fighter on one of the servers I play on. I think I have a pretty good build here except for maybe some of my feat choices. There is a level cap at 13, but sometimes you are allowed to go over that.<br><br>Anyways, my question is basically whether or not I should get Luck of Heroes and Iron Will instead of Lightning Reflexes and Iron Will. The reason I kind of hesitate to get Luck of Heroes instead of Lightning Reflex is because with the lvl 13 cap, I will probably have to get one of my feats at lvl 14, most likely Improved Expertise. Would taking LR+IW be on par with LoH+IW? Or would it end up being weaker?<br><br>Also if anyone has any other suggestions I would appreciate it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Here is the actual build:<br>STR16<br>DEX13<br>CON16<br>INT13<br>WIS8<br>CHA8<br><br>Skills: All go into: Discipline, Heal, Tumble, and Spellcraft.<br><br>1.

Are you married to katanas?  You'd free up a feat by dropping exotic proficiency.  <br><br>When you think about it, a katana's average diceroll damage is only 1 point over a longsword, and magic longswords tend to be more power and more common than practically any other weapon type.<br><br>I guess if your server has a high powered katana you'll want to keep it but otherwise it's something to consider.<br><br>Since you have a small dex bonus you'll probably find it's close to a wash between lightning reflexes and luck of heroes.  You gain a point in your will save - which will be your lowest by far - and lose a point in your reflex save.<br><br>I'd say it's worth it unless mind spell immunity items are available.  Otherwise, will saves are what resist ugly things like fear and stun/daze/etc.  A mighty fighter who gets disabled by almost any mind attack is going to have a really tough time fighting a lot of enemies.<br><br>If you're concerned about your saves, switch to Champion of Torm at level 8.  You'll get the same bonus feats but +1 to your saves every 2 levels.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

I probably won't be able to get CoT levels because these require approval as well... So, are you saying that it would be worth taking Improved Expertise after the level cap to get Luck of Heroes over Lightning Reflexes(Which means I may or may not ever be able to get it)? Or are you saying that I should get rid of Weapon Focus:Katana (Was thinking of a scimitar if I didn't get that) and get Luck of Heroes in its place and keep Imp Expertise? I would think that having a Katana would be better than just +1 to saves, but I don't know. Also, aren't more things reflex based anyways?

Once you have 4 levels of fighter (weapon specialization) the only reason not to be a COT is if you can't (don't meet prereqs, already have 3 classes, requires approval) or are a dualwielder (fighters get dualwield feats as bonus feats, COTs don't).<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;So, are you saying that it would be worth taking Improved Expertise after the level cap to get Luck of Heroes over Lightning Reflexes(Which means I may or may not ever be able to get it)?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Improved Expertise isn't a very useful feat for a fighter in my opinion.  You sacrifice 10 AB for 10 AC... unless you plan on being the tank for a party who's doing damage from behind you, how do you expect to kill anything?

But improved expertise just takes so much off the AB that you, at best, end up in a stalemate - they can't kill you very fast but you aren't killing them either.  Anything you can hit often with -10 to your AB is trivial and probably can't hit you enough to hurt you even if your AC is 10 points lower.<br><br>Bumper Sticker:  Improved Expertise is a loser feat in almost every solo situation, and many team ones too.

Alright, that seems to be some pretty solid advice. Thanks. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   One question I would have is that when extending this build above the cap up to 20, should I be replacing Great Cleave with something else?

Edit: Seems I can't get LR and Great Fortitude at the same level. Guess I will have to move Blind Fight back to level 18 anyways and Lightning Reflexes to 15 anyways.

I guess maybe Improved Expertise would be useful taken at 18th or 20th level. I could take Imp EX at 18 and then Blindfight at 20. Or vice versa. By then my AB should be high enough to hit most stuff, since the highest AC possible on this server is about 40.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By OMGZERGRUSHWTF on 10/28/05 00:39</span></i></p>

Perhaps it is my own likings (I am sure it is). But when I am making a build with only 1 or 2 classes I feel like I can give it a bit more of cheese.<br><br>Have you considered adding a single bard and a single barbarian level?.<br><br>A single barbarian level could give you 10% extra movement speed. It is not much but it can help you, and a single bard level could help you getting tumble to 20, that means 4 more AC, and, if going human you could also take spellcraft to 20, that is +4 to all your saves vs spells. Plus they give you a (very) weak bardsong and a single rage per day at the cost of 1 AB and a Feat.<br><br>IMHO no feat can give you +4 to saves, a decent chance to avoid attacks of opportunity, +4 AC and once-per-rest buffs that could give you a further +1 to will saves and +1 to damage and AB. You could forget about the mobility feat as you have +20 tumble (It will not work always, but will be of some use).<br><br>For attacks of opportunity I would take it to 23, with your dex bonus it would be 24, IIRC a full plate will give you a -8 penalty and the tower shield another -3, that means your "effective" tumble will be 13, that means you have a 90% chance of avoiding an attack of opportunity with tumble, and only 10% will be checked vs your AC.<br><br>It wont give you any xp penalty nor anything.<br><br>It would work mostly with human because the extra skillpoints.<br>_________________<br>HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh.

I guess the only problem with doing that is that the server has a cap around 13 and each level over that has to be gained via a token. So sometimes you would be going over the cap and you wouldn't know when your final level would be, I guess. But maybe I would just do that if I got to lvl 20?

Armor check penalty on a tower shield is a whopping -10. With full plate, that's a total of -18, so with Tumble maxed, you'd have a modified 6 score, meaning you need to roll a 9 or better, so a 60% chance of avoiding AoOs.<br><br>Remember, though, Tumble avoids AoOs for moving in combat, not for any other types of AoOs you may generate, so it's nice, but not a huge deal.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

I heard somewhere that there might be other combos that would be stronger than just plain fighter levels. One of them I heard about was Rogue4/Barb5/Fighter4 by level 13. Increases to Rogue4/Barb12/Fighter4 by level 20. Anyone know whether it would be better to drop the barb levels and maybe just go Rogue4/Fighter 9 by 13 for the feats (4/16 at level 20?)or maybe add cleric levels or something? Only multiclass restrictions are no PRC w/o DM permission. Thanks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By OMGZERGRUSHWTF on 11/01/05 21:05</span></i></p>

a 4rog/5barb/ftr is a good choice. It is alot more versatile than a plain fighter build. Of course I would advice you to take Human as a race, because it is difficult to advance as any other race, because of the experience penalty they recieve. <br><br>Start out as a rogue to get the maximum skill points at lvl 1. From that point on do what suits your style of play.

Okay, one last thing. If I went for that rogue/fighter4/barb5, would expertise + rage work well together? Also would a scimitar/shield be more useful or maybe something like a Greataxe instead?
