Why isn't it 36/3(Paladin)/1?<br>Isn't it better with 3 paladin (Divine Shield)<br><br>And why choose monk instead of Rogue or Bard or anyone else with Tumble skill? (I believe Monk was taken for Tumble and other skills).<br><br>Thank you.

I figure it isn't Paladin 3 because the builder didn't care for Divine Shield. No one is stopping you from making your own version with DS, however.<br><br>Monk is the only class who gets Evasion at level 1, I suppose it's the only advantage. Bard'd get UMD if you liked that more.<br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm

They only took Paladin 1 and Monk 1 because they wanted to keep the Spell Caster Level high for damage and penetration. AC is already so high, plus things like Epic Warding/Premonition/Greater Stoneskin that a few more AC probably isn't terribly important to the build.<br><br>You could get Divine Shield with 1 level of Cleric, but the point of taking Paladin is for the huge Save bonus from Charisma. The reason for taking the monk level is to leverage the now-high Reflex save with Evasion. UMD isn't terribly useful to her - she can already use all arcane scrolls/wands/rods, wear all armor, wield a Holy Avenger, and wear Monk Boots/Robes. UMD would let her use a few race or alignment restricted items, and cleric scrolls, but not much else.<br><br>Note that if you are playing from level 1, she will be much easier to level with if you take the Monk and Paladin levels early, so you have the Cha save bonus and evasion and tumble sooner. If I were playing her on an RP server, I would probably take the Paladin level around 7-10, and the monk level at 17 (pump Tumble and Disciplne to 20). Then one final monk level at 37+ for another skill dump. Costs 1 caster level, but will be much more survivable for the early levels.<br><br>TM
