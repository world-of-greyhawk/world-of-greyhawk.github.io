<b>It's a High Strength Warrior with Fear immune and buffs. Hack'n'Slash 1-40 PvM and PvP.</b><br><br>The young skald was on a well-earned break and had ordered some drink for herself. She took her tankard, and one more, and went to a table where an aging man was seated. She had noticed the man during her performance, and wanted his story. The man wore an old plate mail and an old shield was located beside his chair. Both were battered and showed signs of great usage in battle. Beside him on the bench, with it's point down, he had put his sword. Unlike the armour however, the sword was spotless, seemingly unused and even felt almost radiant. <i>"May I sit, honorable warrior?"</i> the skald asked. <i>"Oh, please sit. Some company won't hurt an old man, especially from a beautiful lady."</i> he replied and gestured to the bench opposite his table. The skald sat down and gave the warrior the other tankard. They exchanged a handshake and their names. <i>"I want your story, venerable warrior."</i> the skald said <i>"You look for sure like a great warrior, and my guess is you have an interesting story in all those scars of yours."</i>. She noticed that aside from his scars and his clear signs of advanced age, that he was in quite good shape. His eyes were clear and strong still, and had that warmth in them that you see only in the rarest of persons. She also noticed that although he was still somewhat big, his armour was a little loose. She could imagine how those arms had once been strong as oak. That chest as strong as castle walls. <i>"I was, well am, a Paladin, Milady. And seeing how old I've become I like to think I was good at what I did."</i> The old man gratefully sipped his tankard while he studied this young skald. She had the immortality of youth almost seeping out, and her gaze was always seeking, curious, studying. He could feel her eyes going over every detail in his armour, weapon and every scar or mark, every feature of him. He sighed slightly and continued <i>"I was a bit unlike other Paladins. I had the divine spells like most, but was more a master of the blade than master of charms. And I tell you, this blade beside me here, is what we Paladins call Holy Avengers. It's the greatest honor a Paladin can have, to wield such one. It protected me from magic, it could even remove magic by a touch of the blade. It never wears, never breaks. Although it's magic is tied to me, and it seems to have waned somewhat."</i> He sighed again, his look somewhat dreamy and distant. She listened intently, and took some notes. <i>"As for my story, young lady, I do hope you have time to spare.</i>. He smiled that warm, welcoming smile again and sipped his ale. He drew his breath and started his tale.<br><br>--------------<br><br>And to the facts:<br><br>Paladin(16), Fighter(2), Weapon Master(22), Human<br><br>STR: 16 (32)<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 13<br>CHA: 8<br><br><br>01: Paladin(1): Dodge, Weapon Focus: Longsword<br>02: Paladin(2): <br>03: Paladin(3): Mobility<br>04: Paladin(4): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>05: Paladin(5)<br>06: Paladin(6): Spring Attack<br>07: Paladin(7)<br>08: Paladin(8): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>09: Paladin(9): Improved Critical: Longsword<br>10: Paladin(10)<br>11: Paladin(11)<br>12: Paladin(12): STR+1, Blind Fight, (STR=19)<br>13: Paladin(13)<br>14: Paladin(14)<br>15: Fighter(1): Extend Spell, Expertise<br>16: Fighter(2): STR+1, Whirlwind Attack, (STR=20)<br>17: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Longsword<br>18: Weapon Master(2): Knockdown<br>19: Weapon Master(3)<br>20: Weapon Master(4): STR+1, (STR=21)<br>21: Weapon Master(5): Great Strength I, (STR=22)<br>22: Weapon Master(6)<br>23: Weapon Master(7)<br>24: Weapon Master(8): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=24)<br>25: Weapon Master(9)<br>26: Weapon Master(10)<br>27: Weapon Master(11): Great Strength III, (STR=25)<br>28: Weapon Master(12): STR+1, (STR=26)<br>29: Weapon Master(13): Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword<br>30: Weapon Master(14): Great Strength IV, (STR=27)<br>31: Weapon Master(15)<br>32: Weapon Master(16): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=28)<br>33: Weapon Master(17): Great Strength V, (STR=29)<br>34: Weapon Master(18)<br>35: Paladin(15)<br>36: Weapon Master(19): STR+1, Epic Skill Focus: Taunt, Armor Skin, (STR=30)<br>37: Weapon Master(20)<br>38: Weapon Master(21)<br>39: Weapon Master(22): Great Strength VI, Epic Toughness I, (STR=31)<br>40: Paladin(16): STR+1, (STR=32)<br><br>Hitpoints: 460<br><br>Saving Throws<br>Fort 24<br>Will 17<br>Ref 19<br><br> <br>BAB: 30<br>AB (max, naked): 50 (melee), 32 (ranged)<br>With maxed STR from items, Bless, Aid, Prayer, DF, Holysword(GMW): <br>69/64/59/54<br>On top of that you have a taunt skill of 52 if necessary.<br><br>Dmg: Unbuffed 1d8+11(15-20/x3)<br>Buffed as above:<br>1d8+22+5magic(15-20/x3)<br>1d6 divine vs evil.<br><br><br><br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 17/28<br><br>Spell Casting: Paladin(4)<br>3-3-1-1<br><br>Skillpoints: 172<br>Concentration 38(39)<br>Discipline 43(54)<br>Intimidate 4(3)<br>Taunt 43(52)<br>Tumble 20(21)<br><br>If this build has weaknesses? Oh I tell you. Crap saves, although most think he doesn't, seeing as it's a paladin. Nothing particular about his AC, it's just <br>FP+Board with no extra source of AC. Not much hitpoints, below average for a full bred warrior.<br><br>Pro's? Oh yeah, he has that too. Melee offense. Excellent AB, with his taunt being succesful it might hit an effective 75. And the damage, although no Bane, is decent enough. Seeing the numerous crits you'll get with keen longsword damage is quite sufficient. In times long gone now, I played this on the dragonlance server (which has just returned) and I tell you, this guy ripped melee builds apart. With a true seeing item he ripped most things apart. Sorry Avado, but combat clerics were just a quick walk in the park. Taunt is a pain, but in most cases I didn't need it, or fired it after a succesful KD, or when the other guy did some casting or whatever. KD.<br><br>I never really wanted to post it before though, but seeing as how the holysword has been nerfed, it is not nearly as powerful today as it was. Those days I dispelled almost anything he were up against in one round. Remember also, that with STR items, and a holy avenger sword his unbuffed AB is 57-61 depending on the STR you can get. That's way above any cleric and above even RDDs.<br><br>I called it knight of yonder (if I haven't misunderstood the word, I'll rename if so) because it feels like lost powers, lost greatness, fond memories of the past. I know many people find Paladins with no CHA very weird, but I think I could justify it in this guy. The weapon of choice is purely since the holy avenger weapon property were only found on longswords. Let's face it, it was a powerful weapon in PvP. (and often PvM)<br><br>There are several ways to adjust it a little, f.ex taking two more fighter (or more) and letting go of SF:taunt for WS and EWS for 6 more damage. You must either give up 2 paladin for it, or 3 WM. I think the best split in such a case would be Paladin17/Fighter4/WM19. Giving up 30 hitpoints, ESF:Taunt and 1 AB for 6 damage and spellslots. The leveling is open for rescheduling too, some people like WM7 way earlier. I never had any problem leveling up though.<br><br>I ain't exactly posting builds very often anymore, but that last Pally build posted reminded me of this guy, and it's about time he got his post. The Knight of Solamnia.<br><br>There are many builds in the searcher with these three classes, but none that had this focus or performed in this way. I'll make a post with those below.<br><br>Hope you guys like it.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 06/03/09 13:09</span></i></p>

I wanna drop WM down to 19 and up Fighter to 4... I feel like the 6 damage gained from WS/EWS would be better than the 1 AB you gain from those levels. No idea what to do with the last level, though... Paladin for slightly longer buffs (ending at 17/4/19)?<br>_________________<br>People who say that I am arrogant are mistaken.

Only a suggestion in the naming of a great build.  'Yonder" infers a distance.  I don't think that's what you meant.  I think you mean "yore" which infers a difference in time in the past.   So, I would respectfully suggest a change in title to "Knight of Yore".     Maerll<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Maerll on 06/03/09 02:17</span></i></p>
