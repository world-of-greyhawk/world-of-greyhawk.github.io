How about some character builds that are also excelent at level 24?<br><br>Level 40 is so..... not fun to play, it's retire time. (just an opinion)<br><br>Let me start with this one:<br>(4 bard, 10 rdd, 10 palemaster)<br><br>3 levels of bard (points in lore, save the rest)<br>2 levels of palemaster (points in lore, save the rest)<br>9 levels of red dragon disciple (get your +2 int asap)<br>8 levels of palemaster<br>1 level of bard (points in tumble)<br>1 level of red dragon disciple (points in discipline, spot)<br><br>At this level you can have the Overwhelming critical feat.<br>Stats can be anything you like, but for example, you could have (at this level):<br>str: 24 (started at 16, 8 bonus from rdd)<br>dex: 22 (started at 16, 1 point each 4th level)<br>con: 12 (started at 10, 2 bonus from rdd)<br>wis: 8<br>int: 14 (started at 12, 2 bonus from rdd)<br>cha: 12 (started at 12, able to cast level 2 bard spellsm does rdd give +2 cha???)<br><br>Immunities: Fire, Critical hits, sleep, paralasys, stun<br>Naked AC: 31<br>Low attack bonus, but strength increasing items can help with this.<br><br>Armor you could wear: scalemail (4 AC, max dex bonus: 4, totals to 8 ) , so almost as good as full plate (8 AC, max dex bonus 1, totals to 9 ) and scalemail has only a 20% spell failure, you might be able to find scalemail with -% spell failure.<br><br>Progression after level 24:<br>You could go for 2 more bard levels after level 28 (increase charisma to be able to cast level 3 spells)<br>Or you can continue with the red dragon disciple for more hitpoints, better AC and a better breath weapon. You can increase dexterity 1 more to be able to get improved whirlwind attack.<br><br>Alternative builds:<br>If you are not interested in improved whirwind attack or casting spells, just leave dex at 12 and put those points into constitution. Take heavy armor profiency and go for as much AC as you can get.<br>If you want to have more bard levels, also leave dex at 12 and put those points into charisma and constitution.<br>_________________<br>Help. Help. I'm being repressed!<br><br>Edited By Tal Rasha on 03/10/04 04:43:25<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 02:50</span></i></p>
