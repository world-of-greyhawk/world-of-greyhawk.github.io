I checked pulsecap's doohicky and only found 1 other build with these classes.  That was xylo's well made RP Adventure Guy, and he uses different class splits, and is made for a different purpose.  Basically, I wanted a tough dwarf who had Epic DR, Dev Crit, and the epic rage feats.  He doesn't get Thundering Rage, due to having Overwhelming Crit.  The massive critical 2d6 bonus you get with Thundering Rage does not stack with Overwhelming Crit damage bonus.  Admittedly, you would get the most out of the Epic Rage feats on low magic servers, but they do help out somewhat on Mid-High magic servers.<br><br>I would write a cool short story for this guy, but I am a bit on the lazy side, and my story would pale in comparison to those written by Grizz, xylo, and the like.  Anyways, on to the build:  <br><br><br>Race- Dwarf<br>Alignment- I choose Chaotic Neutral (any non lawful, non evil will do)<br><br>Starting<br><br>Str- 17 <br>Dex- 9 <br>Con- 18 <br>Wis- 8 <br>Int- 14<br>Cha- 6 <br><br>Increase Str- 4,8,12,16,20,24,28,36<br>Increase Con- 32,40<br><br>Leveling<br><br>1- Barbarian 1  Weapon Proficiency(Exotic) <br>2- Barbarian 2 <br>3- Barbarian 3  Armor Proficiency(Heavy) <br>4- Barbarian 4  <br>5- Barbarian 5   <br>6- Barbarian 6  Weapon Focus (Dwarven War Axe) <br>7- Barbarian 7 <br>8- Barbarian 7/CoT 1 <br>9- Barbarian 7/CoT 2  Improved Critical(DWA), Power Attack <br>10- Barbarian 7/CoT 3<br>11- Barbarian 7/CoT 4  Cleave <br>12- Barbarian 8/CoT 4  Great Cleave <br>13- Barbarian 9/CoT 4 <br>14- Barbarian 10/CoT 4 <br>15- Barbarian 11/CoT 4  Blind Fight <br>16- Barbarian 12/CoT 4 <br>17- Barbarian 13/CoT 4 <br>18- Barbarian 14/CoT 4  Toughness <br>19- Barbarian 15/Cot 4<br>20- Barbarian 16/CoT 4<br>21- Barbarian 17/CoT 4  Great Str 1<br>22- Barbarian 17/CoT 4/Rogue 1  (Let the cheese begin <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   ) <br>23- Barbarian 17/CoT 5/Rogue 1 <br>24- Barbarian 17/CoT 6/Rogue 1  Epic Weapon Focus, Overwhelming Crit <br>25- Barbarian 18/CoT 6/Rogue 1 <br>26- Barbarian 19/CoT 6/Rogue 1 <br>27- Barbarian 19/CoT 7/Rogue 1  Great Con 1 <br>28- Barbarian 19/CoT 8/Rogue 1  Dev Crit <br>29- Barbarian 20/CoT 8/Rogue 1 <br>30- Barbarian 21/CoT 8/Rogue 1  Great Con 2 <br>31- Barbarian 22/CoT 8/Rogue 1<br>32- Barbarian 23/CoT 8/Rogue 1 <br>33- Barbarian 24/CoT 8/Rogue 1  Mighty Rage, Epic DR 1 <br>34- Barbarian 25/CoT 8/Rogue 1 <br>35- Barbarian 26/CoT 8/Rogue 1<br>36- Barbarian 27/CoT 8/Rogue 1  Terrifying Rage <br>37- Barbarian 27/CoT 9/Rogue 1 <br>38- Barbarian 27/CoT 10/Rogue 1  Epic DR 2 <br>39- Barbarian 28/CoT 10/Rogue 1  Epic DR 3, Epic Prowess <br>40- Barbarian 28/CoT 10/Rogue 2  (Obligatory Skill Dump)<br><br><br>Ending<br><br>Str- 26 <br>Dex- 9 <br>Con- 22 <br>Wis- 8 <br>Int- 14 <br>Cha- 6 <br><br><br>Skills-  You have a total of 228 skill points to use as you wish.  Plenty enough to cater skills to your world.  I went with:<br><br>Intimidate- 43<br>Taunt- 42<br>Tumble- 40<br>Open Lock- 43<br>UMD- 42<br>Spellcraft- 18 (20)<br><br><br>HP- 732 base (max rolls), with Mighty and Greater Rage- 972<br><br><br>AC- nekkid 17, with plate and tower 28<br><br><br>AB- with mundane DWA 42/37/32/27<br>    with Mighty and Greater Rage 48/43/38/33<br><br>Saves:<br><br>Fort- 35 (41 with Rages) +6 against spells<br>Reflex- 23 +6 against spells<br>Will- 20 (27 with Rages) +6 against spells<br><br><br>Natural DR of 15<br><br><br>Gripe time.  This always get me hyped up.  How can those skinny, stinky elves get free longsword and longbow feats, yet dwarfs (who the dang weapon was named after) do not get free proficiency of the Dwarven War Axe?  If it was like it was supposed to be, that would have freed up a feat for me, and I would have gone disarm/improved disarm by not having to use the exotic wep feat and dropping toughness.  Anyways, I accomplished what I set out to do, so I am happy with this build.  Hopefully, it will help out somebody else as well.<br><br>This guy is <b>playable from 1-40.</b>  I designed him for <b>PvM.</b>  <i>It should be noted that there will be an xp penalty from level 22 on,</i> but that is not really a big deal to me.  Boosting AC up by 5, being able to use magic devices, and being able to pick locks from level 22 on made him more playable for me and worth the xp penalty.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 01/30/06 01:48</span></i></p>

Nice one, Dwarves becomes Barbarians as easy as H-Ors's do IMO.<br><br> About the Dwarf Axe, in 3.5 it is a martial weapon for Dwarves, so NwN2 will give it to you free. Well planned build, each feat seems to fit right in.
