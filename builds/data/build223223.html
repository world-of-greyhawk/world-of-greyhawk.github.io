Introduction:<br>Blessed Warrior of Lolth, <b>Playable from 1 to 40, PvM</b><br><br>While not so much of a stereotypical warrior, I think this represents an Elven warrior type. A fighter whom is dexterious and somewhat fragile in toe-to-toe (well, he's not meant to soak up hard hits from Dragons like a Dwarf could <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> ). <br><br>Assassin, I think, suits a Drow well. Evil and dark... that's what I see when I picture an assassin. Blackguard is where Lolth, the god which (who?) the Drow worship, steps in. This character can pray to his god for assistance in combat and his when "handling" his "contracts", for a little boon (which, of course, grows in power with Charisma buffs/equipment).<br><br>Race: Elf (Drow)<br><br>Alignment: Chaotic (any) Evil<br><br>Attributes:<br><br>Starting<br>--------<br>Strength     14<br>Dexterity    16<br>Constitution 12<br>Intelligence 14<br>Wisdom       8<br>Charisma     14<br><br>Ending (8 to Dexterity, 2 to Charisma)<br>------<br>Strength     14<br>Dexterity    28<br>Constitution 12<br>Intelligence 14<br>Wisdom       8<br>Charisma     20<br><br>Levels:<br><br>Guide<br>-----<br><br>1.

Nice build Finneous. Nice AB, and nice damage output for a Dex build. I like Drow Assassin builds also. I agree that they go together well.<br><br>IKD would be nice to have for sneak attacks.

I really like this build and concept.  I think he would be a lot of fun to play.  Well done.<br><br>Two things to consider:  <br><br>1. What about Called Shot in this build?  You stealth, you come up behind, you are top-loaded with sneak and death attack and EWS, you catch people flatfooted, they lose all Dex and Dodge AC, and to add insult to injury, you make all your sneak attacks Called Shots: Arm.  Just in case they wanted to retaliate.<br><br>2.  What if you took only 4 levels of Blackguard?  I would suggest even 2, but you wouldn't be able to get both divine feats that way-- unless you took BG3.  This could give you two more levels for Fighter for another feat(Called Shot), and two more levels of Assassin for a sneak and higher Death Attack DC.  However, I can see that part of the reason in taking BG7 is to preserve your pre-epic BAB.  You would lose an AB point in dropping 3-4 BG levels, because you still want to reserve some fighter levels to Epic.<br><br>The way it is now is just fine, but when I see a build I like, I start fartin' around with it.  Once again, nice job, lad.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

The most obvious is dropping Knockdown for Called Shot, but I really like Knockdown in a build like this. Then, if you go with Fighter 10/Blackguard 4/Assassin 26 you effectively gain a feat in the epic levels, which could be used to pick Called Shot. Then there's the option to go human, either with the original level spread to gain 1 additional feat, or a human Fighter 10/Blackguard 4/Assassin 26 to gain 2 feats compared to the original build. That'd make IKD/Called Shot nicely, though the other would still be picked in epic where Armor Skin for example is another choice. Humans lose one dexterity modifier, though. So uhh, what do you think is the best way? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>2.

Fighter 12 allows one more feat to be picked in pre-epic so it's worth consideration, but in the end Assassin 26 is perhaps better?<br><br>No matter what magic you use, you'll end up with 28 BAB if dropping Blacguard levels, and 39 AB (38 with human).

So... the human version would pick Knockdown at level 1. Then Called Shot at level 15, and finally there's an open feat at level 27.
