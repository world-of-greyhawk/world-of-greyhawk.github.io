Ok, it's been a year and a half since last i played NWN or did any building so I got some questions that are most likely basic but I've lost my book where all the info is and with dial-up connection i can relly take me so much time to look around this pages for info so:<br><br>The plan was to make a ranger8/assassin10/shadowdancer2 build.<br>In the beginning, it's not meant to be epic but i may continue there after a little work and planning.<br><br>If i chose elf, as I have so far, will i get any exp penalties with two prestige classes or doesn't that apply to the exp penalty rules, never really got the quite.. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif"> <br><br>After a short calculation, I made that the total pre-epic AB will be above 16 (ranger 8+ assasin 7,5 and SD 1 =16,5)so I'll get all four attacks each turn.<br><br>Benefits: HIPS, good sneak attack, good hide and move silently, good tumble, good AC.<br><br>The starting stats would be:<br>str: 14<br>dex: 17<br>con: 11 (think that was it...)<br>wis: 14 (this gives me lv1 ranger spells and enables me to use the assasin spells too, but mabye i can use them anyways..?)<br>int: 10 (mabye it was 12, cant remember quite...)<br>cha: 10 (i'd rather this be 8 or even 6 but when playing solo you need some ability to interact with NPCs and merchants, but 6 for pvp)<br><br>this gives me low damage on regular hits with so low strength, may consider increasing it to 16 on the cost of cha.<br>Feats: WF,W-finesse (using rapiers for high critrange and still being light weapon so that i'll benefit from this feat),Knockdown (need this early), dodge, mobility, blind fight (using the darkness spell remember), dirty fighting. these are the pre-epic feats, should you have any more left you can put it into disarm (or did that require 13 int..?) or IKD or whatever you feel like.<br><br>Skills: Hide, Move silently, tumble. the rest doesnt really matter, but put them into parry, heal or dicipline, or whatever you feel most important to you.

As Finn suggested, go with 9 RGR levels. Drop Assn to 9 levels. This will still provide +16 BAB for the full attack routine, you'll keep Evasion from level 2 SD, and you won't lose out on anything from dropping the Assn level except an extra +1 on saves vs poisons.<br><br>I also like the STR route, but DEX can be viable as well.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...

Ok, thanks alot folks!<br><br>Just a few more things that popped into my mind:<br>-The feat Stealthy (gives +4 to hide and MS skill checks) is it worth it or should i just go with epic skill focus on epic levs or just screw it?<br>-My plan was to get enough ranger levels to gain bane of enemies, but that will cost me the opportunity to gain 10d6 death attack... But with the improved sneak attack feat on epic levels that may not be needed.<br>-If i go strength based human, I'll get alot less hide and other dex skills (and i lose the elf bonuses to dex skills), that this build sorta rely heavily on but I could make up for this by taking bout 8 great dex feats in epic levels.<br>-And Wis 12 makes me lose the ranger spells (tho they're not THAT good, except for the camouflage and ultravision) but i'll be able to use assassin spells with only 12 wis right?<br><br>Thanks so far, I'll start making the full build tomorrow, it's a little late now...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Groml on 07/27/06 23:54</span></i></p>

Even a STR based Ranger can get very respectable stealth skills with only ESF: MS. If we imagine he's using light armor with no ACP and has maxed skills and 14 DEX, his basee score for hide is 45 and MS 55. Now, cast Empowered Cat's, Camouflage, One with the Land and Mass Camouflage. You get 72 Hide/62 MS. Not many non-ranger DEXers can get there (but they can with Stealthy, about 38 DEX and SFs).<br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 07/28/06 10:13</span></i></p>

Durned...<br><br>I'd just tested the entire build through to see what I needed and wanted and such, then I started recording everything down piece by piece, making the build again from the bottom.<br>The offcourse when I was about to save it at lv 30, notepad screwed up and I lost all my work...<br>I'm going out now so either I fix it tonight or you'll see it tomorrow.<br>Tried with int 12 and Wis 14 first time, second time with int 14 i see why that was the better choice, forgot how many nice feats that needs 13 int...<br><br>But im planning to take KD, IKD, Disarm (cuz its so cunning), IDA, Blind Fight, Armour Skin, Epic Prowess, 2 great dex, (E)WF, imp crit (15-20 crit roll <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> , you dont get overwhelming with ranger now do you..?), epic skill focus in hide and MS. Was thinking epic will if i got a spare feat since the saves of this build are... awful.<br><br>Skills: Hide, MS, Tumble, Use magic device, search/spot (solo or pvp) and dicipline/parry, all maxed.<br>For questing you could always put a skillpoint into Animal empathy just to activate it altho your skill check will still be 0 cuz of cha modifier. (there are some hidden quests at least in SoU that require it).<br><br>Updating soon, I hope...<br>PS: t'was too late for editing the previous post.

If you intend to make a sneaker, IMO, you need to make your stealth skills as high as possible, that way you avoid detection by as many people as possible. High detect Clerics (in PvP) are always going to cause you problems if they can see you as your fortitude save is rarely high enough to protect against implosions.<br><br>Generally the best sneaker around is a 12 monk, 15 ranger, 13 rogue. You have speed from your monk levels which means you can move faster than your targets, sneak attacks from rogue levels &amp; some nice ranger bonuses / spells to further boost your hiding capability. Take 6 great dexterity feats with a starting dexterity of 20, stealthy feat, skill foci (hide / ms), esf (hide / ms) and you are laughing!<br><br>Halfling is definately the way to go as with +4 to hide / ms from small stature AND +2 to ms from skill affinity, you can acheive virtually undetectable status.

Well, my plan was to make this a viable stealthed combatbuild , not to be 100% invisible to all end everyone, only to most people.<br>But you are correct as I'm sure you know. If noone else bothered to make a build like you mentioned, I'll get on it right away.<br>(Posted last edition of this build in Epic builds page too)
