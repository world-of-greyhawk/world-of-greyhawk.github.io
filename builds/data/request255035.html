<b>Blades of the Ultra-Violet</b><br><br><b>Premise</b><br>Hear ye! Hear ye!  Alright, lads, listen up.  I have a build contest for you.  Winner gets bragging rights.  I need a character that is true to the name, "Blades of the Ultra-Violet".  Primarily, this needs to be a stealth-based character who makes his money by ripping people to shreds in clouds of Darkness via Ultravision or Truesight.  However, there are some caveats to that:<br><br><b>Requirements</b><br>1.  Must be able to cast Darkness multiple times a day-- 3 minimum.  UMD will not be counted to arrive at this figure.<br><br>2.  Ultravision (or Truesight) spell must have minimum 10 hour duration.<br><br>3.  Need a minimum of <b>42 AB</b>, before buffs/enhancements<br><br>4.  Must have minimum of 10d6 sneak dice (Rogue, Assn, BG,ISA or any combination thereof)<br><br>5.  Can be Strength or Dex-based<br><br>6.  If Dex-based, it must have Epic Dodge by <i>Level 27</i>.<br><br>7.  Any race, but NO XP penalty anywhere in the build.<br><br>8.  Must have damage sources other than by Sneak Attacks (e.g., WS/EWS, Bane, Strength, etc.)<br><br>9.  Must have a minimum of 4 attacks per round without arcane/divine means.<br><br>10. Cannot have less than <b>30 AC</b> (either naked or mundane equipment)<br><br>11. Cannot have fewer than 375 hitpoints<br><br>12.  Cannot have fewer than 250 skill points.<br><br>13.  Must have 20+ base saves in all 3 save categories (Spellcraft, HS bonus, etc will not be counted)<br><br>14.  It must be playable from 1-40, PvM<br><br>*************<br>*************<br><br>This is a tall order, and should prove to be quite a challenge.  Hopefully I didn't make it too challenging.  I think it can be approached from a variety of ways, and I think the end result will be quite a unique build, and something I would like to play.  <br><br>Post questions, comments or final build within this thread for judgement.  Please don't post one that "almost" meets the prereqs.  It must meet all 14 items on the checklist.  <br><br>Time for some of you upstarts to put your Building Skills to the test.<br><br>Good luck.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 10/07/06 15:30</span></i></p>

It is a worthy challenge Dwarflord, a worthy one indeed. Here's my take on it.

I'll be damned.  Never explored that possibility.  Very nice, Master Kail, very nice.  Touche'! You outdid yourself this time.  You managed to just scrape by in every category, but did so in style.

Thank you master Dwarflord. One question, since I'm exploring other possibilities: 4 apr means 4 base attacks or dual wielding can be used to meet (and surpass) the requirement?<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!

Not too many tries. I went straight out for a STR approach and I chose BG to get together full BAB progression and SA. I tried a Bard/RDD/BG combo but to meet all the requirements (skillpoints were some 10 points short of 250) I ended up with Bard 13/RDD 2/BG 25. It is still a possibility, but I feel the bard song/curse song enhanced power is better than +1 AB/AC from the 2 RDD lvls. Also, this way it is still open to  RDD, PM or Paladin cheese. And as it is, it has a somehow elegant look.<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!

Of course, with only 14 WIS, you miss out on your level 5 and 6 Cleric slots, but the stringent requirements deny that as an option.

Hmmm....the plot thickens.  Not bad, not bad at all. I really like the number of Darknesses you can cast a day.   Can you find a way to get EWS in the build while still avoiding the XP issue and still maintaining a 42AB?<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

This is nearly a mirror reflection of what I came up with.  The only differences are CS at 33rd, EWS at 29th, and I chose Animal and Strength domains.  Animal for Cats Grace and Truesight at 3rd level, and Strength for DP at 3rd level.  War is still a good one, and Trickery sort of loses playability since one has to wait a long time before accessing 5th level spells.  <br><br>Okay, thanks Kail and Cin.  It appears to be largely a 2 man effort.  I shall reflect on these, and announce the winner shortly.

Good one, Grim.  You actually used the classes that one would think to use in such a build, and made it work.  Why I couldn't do it is beyond me.  So that's 4 entries.  Or is it 5?  What is everyone's opinions?  Which do you think best represents the ideal of the "Blade of the Ultra-violet?"<br><br>To muddy matters a bit further, here's something I've been tinkering on, and somehow it managed to meet all the requirements.  The only snafu is that Darkness/Ultravsion combos don't get cooking until Epic, and it might be a tad challenging to play in Lvls 1-8.<br><br>Sorc8/BG19/Rogue13<br><br>Str16 (32)<br>Int14<br>Wis8<br>Dex10<br>Con14<br>Chr14<br><br>1 Rogue1, Knockdown, Power Attack<br>2 Rogue2<br>3 Rogue3, Cleave<br>4 Rogue4, Str17<br>5 Rogue5<br>6 Rogue6, Blindfighting<br>7 Rogue7<br>8 Rogue8, Str18<br>9 BG1, WF: Battle Axe<br>10 BG2<br>11 Sorcerer1<br>12 BG3, Improved KD, Str19<br>13 BG4<br>14 BG5<br>15 Sorcerer2, Extend Spell<br>16 BG6, Str20<br>17 BG7<br>18 BG8, Toughness<br>19 BG9<br>20 BG10, Str21<br>21 Rogue9, Great Str I<br>22 Rogue10, Improved Evasion<br>23 Sorc3<br>24 Sorc4, Great Str II, Str24<br>25 Sorc5<br>26 Sorc6<br>27 Rogue11, Epic Will<br>28 Sorc7, Str25<br>29 BG11<br>30 BG12, Great Str IV<br>31 BG13, EWF: Battle Axe<br>32 Rogue12, Str27<br>33 BG14, Great Str V<br>34 BG15<br>35 BG16, Armor Skin<br>36 Sorc8, Great Str VI, Str30<br>37 Rogue13, ESF: Taunt<br>38 BG17<br>39 BG18, Great Str VII<br>40 BG19, Armor Skin, Str 32<br><br>AB: 42/37/32/27<br>AC: 31<br>HP: 420<br>Sneaks: 13d6 <br><br><b>Saves</b><br>Fort: 23 (31)<br>Will : 21 (29)<br>Reflex: 21 (29)<br><br><b>Skill Points: 263</b><br><br>Taunt: 55<br>Tumble: 40<br>Spellcraft: 38<br>UMD: 38 (40)<br>Discipline: 43 (54)<br>61 points remaining<br><br>Darknesses per Day: 6 +5 extended = 11<br>Extended Ultravision: 16 hours<br><br><b>Bonuses:</b><br>Stacking Bulls<br>Evasion<br>Charisma synergy<br>+3d6 more sneak than required<br>High Taunt<br>High Damage output<br><br><b>Negatives:</b><br>420 no great shakes for a Strengther<br>Saves just squeak by<br>No Improved Critical (though IKD could be sacked)<br>Levels 1-8 tough due to armor restrictions<br>Darkness/Combo not actualized until Epic<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Try testing it offline when you get the opportunity Grim, pick a cleric and fight a rogue for example: you'll see that with True Seeing active you won't get hit by sneaks while in darkness, provided you are engaged in combat of course.

Some of these look real hard to better. Tried a halfling rogue/wiz/CoT, met all the requirements, save the AB.

If it's not too late, here's one more way to skin a cat, though I'm not sure it's better than any of the others that have already been posted.  It's actually quite similar to Cinn's build except I went for the sweet spot at Cleric 15 and maximum effective use of DP.  Ended up using the COT levels to get wisdom up high enough to cast 6th level spells.  I would normally have sacrificed some of the starting strength to shore up other attributes but couldn't have made the 41 AB without it.<br><br><br>Cleric(15), Rogue(17), Champion of Torm(8), Human<br><br>Alignment:  Any Non Evil<br><br>Playable 1-40 PvM<br><br>STR: 18 (34)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 14 (16)<br>INT: 12<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Level 01: Cleric(1): Weapon Proficiency Martial, Toughness<br>Level 02: Cleric(2)<br>Level 03: Cleric(3): Weapon Focus<br>Level 04: Cleric(4): STR+1, (STR=19)<br>Level 05: Cleric(5)<br>Level 06: Cleric(6): Extend Spell<br>Level 07: Cleric(7)<br>Level 08: Cleric(8): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>Level 09: Rogue(1): Knockdown<br>Level 10: Rogue(2)<br>Level 11: Rogue(3)<br>Level 12: Rogue(4): STR+1, Improved Critical, (STR=21)<br>Level 13: Rogue(5)<br>Level 14: Rogue(6)<br>Level 15: Rogue(7): Still Spell<br>Level 16: Rogue(8): STR+1, (STR=22)<br>Level 17: Cleric(9)<br>Level 18: Cleric(10): Blind Fight<br>Level 19: Cleric(11)<br>Level 20: Cleric(12): STR+1, (STR=23)<br>Level 21: Rogue(9): Epic Weapon Focus<br>Level 22: Rogue(10): Crippling Strike<br>Level 23: Rogue(11)<br>Level 24: Rogue(12): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR=25)<br>Level 25: Rogue(13): Improved Evasion<br>Level 26: Rogue(14)<br>Level 27: Rogue(15): Great Strength II, (STR=26)<br>Level 28: Rogue(16): STR+1, Improved Sneak Attack I, (STR=27)<br>Level 29: Champion of Torm(1)<br>Level 30: Champion of Torm(2): Great Strength III, Armor Skin, (STR=28)<br>Level 31: Champion of Torm(3)<br>Level 32: Champion of Torm(4): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=29)<br>Level 33: Champion of Torm(5): Great Strength IV, (STR=30)<br>Level 34: Champion of Torm(6): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=15)<br>Level 35: Cleric(13)<br>Level 36: Cleric(14): STR+1, Great Strength V, (STR=32)<br>Level 37: Cleric(15)<br>Level 38: Champion of Torm(7)<br>Level 39: Champion of Torm(8): Great Strength VI, Great Wisdom II, (STR=33), (WIS=16)<br>Level 40: Rogue(17): STR+1, (STR=34)<br><br><br>Hitpoints: 382<br><br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 25/27/23<br>BAB: 25<br>AB (max, naked): 41 (melee), 25 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 19/30<br><br>Spell Casting: Cleric(6) 6/7/7/7/5/5/4<br><br>Skillpoints: 274<br>Discipline 42(54)<br>Spellcraft 39(40)<br>Tumble 40(39)<br>UMD 42(41)<br>Remaining 111<br>_________________<br>In order to find his equal, an Irishman is forced to talk to<br>God.

What's Still spell for? Lemme guess... stilling lvl 6 not extendable spells in lvl 7 spell slots, right? I'd drop IC or WP: martial for Empower spell, for further utility and spellbook management.<br><br>Nice lvl split me likes it. I was working on something similar too, but my kids kept me busy.

Okay.  Time for a re-cap of what we got, and to make a judgement.  Lots of great builds, and I think for the most part quite original and worthy of EBG submission.  Let's summarize.<br><br><b>Kail Pendragon</b> (has 3 entries)<br><br>1. Class: <i>Human Bard15/Blackguard25</i>; strength-based; good spells, utilizes Bard potential, no Rogue feats<br><br>2. Class: <i>Halfling Rogue19/Bard11/Ftr10</i>: Dex-based, Epic Dodge, CS, EWS, but takes awhile to get Darkness/Ultra combo cooking<br><br>3. Class: <i>Halfling Rogue19/Cleric11/Ftr10</i>: Dex-based, Epic Dodge, CS, EWS, Divine Power expoit, great damage, matures early<br>_________<br><br><b>Cinnabar Din</b><br><br>1. Class: <i>Human Rogue 17/Ftr12/Cleric11</i>; Strength-based, no DP exploit, no EWS<br>__________<br><br><b>Grminir77</b><br><br>1. <i>Dwarf Ranger11/Cleric9/Assassin20</i>; Strength-based, no DP exploit, no Rogue bonus feats or Rogue skill points, 16Int in a melee build<br><br>___________<br><br><b>Grizz</b><br><br>1. <i>Human Sorc8/Rogue13/BG19</i>; Strength based, good damage, Darkness/Ultra matures late<br>___________<br><br><b>Highlander44</b><br><br>1. <i>Human Cleric15/Rogue17/CoT8</i>; strength-based, DP exploit, good damage, better saves, CS, maxes Cleric potential<br><br>2.  <i>Half-Orc Cleric 15/Rogue17/CoT8</i>; same as above, loses skill points, gains style points and hit points<br>____________<br><br><br><b>dmuzzy</b><br><br>1. <i>Human Rogue17/Sorc8/Rdd15</i>; high strength, very unique, CS, matures earlier than one would predict<br><br>2. <i>Halfling Rogue21/Figther9/Wizard10</i>; dex-based, Epic Dodge, matures early, could probably still squeeze in Ftr10 if he tried.<br><br>____________<br><br>Okay, that's quite a bit to look at it and evaluate.  Hopefully I summed up the highlights accurately.  At first glance, I'm leaning toward Kail's #3, Highlander's #2 and dmuzzy's #1.  I need some other experts to chime in, and see which is the best to their liking.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 10/10/06 15:12</span></i></p>

Since the outcome has yet to be decided ......If it's not too late, I'd like to enter a dark horse into the race.  Although not as powerful as most of the other entries, this build makes up for much of it with shear style and RP opportunity.

Well, judging at level 40, I would also have to concur with you on Kail's Halfling build.  I would follow it quickly with Highlanders first build (I'm partial to Human, but that's just me). As most other requirements are nearly the same (AB, AC, etc), I think that Epic Dodge is going to tip things in its favor.<br><br>However, for the actual leveling process, I think that I would prefer Highlanders build, I like how the Cleric buffs are their undiluted early on, and then the Rogue comes in to add sneaks and skills.  I also like the 15 levels in Cleric for the +5 in GMW and Divine Favor. I also like Crippling strike so early on. <br><br>But, again, at level 40 I think Kail's has the edge.<br><br>Cheers.

At the end of the day, it comes down to your preference Grizz.  Both builds (Kail's &amp; mine) are solid.  If we break it down a little, it may help with the decision.  For comparison purposes, I am going to assume that Kail's Halfling is dual wielding daggers and that my Half Orc is wielding a one handed weapon for the shield benefit.  I am also going to assume that Kail's build would have access to Cat's Grace as a domain spell as it is dex based.<br><br><b>Hit Points</b> - Halfling 382 - <b>Half Orc 424</b><br><br><b>Skill Points</b> - <b>Halfling 261</b> - Half Orc 249 <br><br><b>Offense</b> - <b>Halfling</b><br><br>Unbuffed Attack Schedule<br>Halfling - 40/35/40 Main Hand - 40/35 Off Hand<br>Half Orc - 41/36/41<br><br>Buffed Attack Schedule - Base + Fixed Buffs + DF + GMW + Stat(CG or BS) <br><b>Halfling</b> - 59/54/49/59 Main Hand - 59/54 Off Hand<br>Half Orc - 63/58/53/63<br><br><i>* Fixed Buffs = 5 DP +1 Bless +1 Aid +1 Prayer +2 Battletide = 10</i><br><br>Damage per Hit<br>Halfling = 2.5 Base +4 GMW +4 DP +6 EWS +2 BT +4 DF +2 Bull's +13 Darkfire = 37.5<br><b>Half Orc</b> = 4.5 Base +5 GMW +12 Str +2 BT +5 DF +2 Bulls + 15 Darkfire = 43.5<br><br><b>Defense</b><br><br>AC - Buffed<br><b>Halfling</b> = 31 Naked + 2 Cat's + 3 Magic Vestment + 3 Stone Bones = 39 + Epic Dodge<br>Half Orc = 30 Plate &amp; Shield +10 Magic Vestment x 2 + 3 Stone Bones = 43<br><br><b>Spell casting</b><br><br>Halfling - 6/7/6/6/4/3/2 Caster Level 11<br><b>Half-Orc</b> - 6/7/7/7/5/5/4 Caster level 15 <br><br><br>In summary, I'm forced to concede that Kail's build is probably the better build.

Okay.  I did this one almost as a joke, but in retrospect he actually isn't bad.  His Rogue side develops early, he gets the Cleric combo (Darkness/Ultravsion/Divine Power) going early, gets Epic Dodge at Level 21, gets SC V, has the same AB as Kail's Halfling, and easily makes all the Save Requirements.  However he falls about 100 hit points shy of the hit point mark, so that's automatic disqualification.  At the end of the day, I don't think he's as playable as Kail's until Level 21.<br><br>Rogue24/CoT6/Cleric10<br>Race: Halfling<br><br>Str10<br>Int10<br>Wis14<br>Dex20 (34)<br>Con10<br>Chr8<br><br>1 Rogue1, TWF<br>2 Rogue2<br>3 Rogue3,  Weapon Finesse<br>4 Cleric1, Dex21, Strength &amp; War<br>5 Cleric2<br>6 Cleric3, Ambidexterity<br>7 Rogue4<br>8 Cleric4, Dex22<br>9 Cleric5, Extend Spell<br>10 Cleric6<br>11 Cleric7<br>12 Rogue5, WF: Daggers, Dex23<br>13 Rogue6<br>14 Rogue7<br>15 Rogue8, Blindfighting<br>16 Rogue9, Dex24<br>17 Rogue10, Improved Evasion<br>18 Cleric8, ITWF<br>19 Rogue11<br>20 Rogue12, Dex25<br>21 Rogue13, Defensive Roll, Epic Dodge<br>22 Rogue14<br>23 CoT1<br>24 CoT2, EWF, Great Dex II, Dex27<br>25 CoT3<br>26 CoT4, Epic Prowess<br>27 Rogue15, Great Dex II<br>28 Cleric9, Dex29<br>29 CoT5<br>30 Cleric10, Great Dex III<br>31 Rogue16, SC I<br>32 Rogue17, Dex31<br>33 Rogue18, SC II<br>34 Rogue19 SC III<br>35 Rogue20<br>36 Rogue21, SC IV, Dex 32<br>37 Rogue22<br>38 Rogue23<br>39 CoT6, Armor Skin, Great Dex IV<br>40 Rogue24, SC V, Dex34<br><br>HP: 284<br>AC: 33 (naked)<br>AB: 42/37/32<br>Dualwielding: 40/35/30/40/35<br>Divine Switch: 45/40/35/45/45/40<br><br>Fort: 23<br>Will: 25<br>Reflex: 35<br><br>Skills: 248<br><br>Hide: 40<br>Move Silently: 40<br>Tumble: 40<br>Discipline: 40<br>UMD: 36<br>52 remaining<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Hmm sorry for posting here(if I wasn't allowed to) but I got some questions about that build(atleast the 2 winning builds).<br><br>I have tried several times some builds from the site but fail miserably because I have no idea what is the recommended equipment for the character or the equipment it would most highly need to survive.<br><br>About those two builds, what equip would be excellent for them? Heavy, Light or Medium armor(then what specific armor in that category, like Full Plate armor). What amulets type, rings, bracers or gloves, belts or boots it would benefit from. And what helm would it be better of with. Also cloak.<br><br>I dont know a thing about build making but I somethings try to come up with things that would be unexpected on the servers. That is my reaction when I read about those two builds(the ones that grizzled_dwarflord likes most). I also like the made up name: Blades of the Ultra-Violet

One should always be shifting things around throughtout level progression, and even throughout individual battles.  Equipment should never be static.  Typically, equipment that I go for the most on Dex builds are AC items.  Remember which AC types don't stack, and go from there.  It does no good to wear a +3 Cloak of Protection and a +2 Ring of Protection, as the 2 don't stack.  So, you need one item that grants Deflection AC (either Ring or Cloak, in some cases Boots or Helms will offer this, too), one item that grants Natural AC (usually an Amulet, but can also be covered via scroll, or Barkskin potion/spell), one item that grants Dodge AC (usually Boots of the Sun Soul that can be worn if your UMD is high enough), and then Armor and/or Shield AC.  Armor AC can be gained directly through enchanted armor bonuses, or Bracers, and in case of Dexers, there are Robes or Clothes that will grant Armor AC.  Also, even if one doesn't use a Shield, it's a good idea to keep one handy in case you need the AC.  A +3 Large Shield is instant +5 AC, and can go a long way against high AB hitters.  <br><br>It is also wise to have items that increase Strength in case you are having a hard time doing damage because the creatures have Damage Resistance, Reduction, heavy hit points or are Regenerators, or are immune to sneaks and crits.  Whatever you can do to increase damage output is a good idea.<br><br>And just in case you don't have the spells available, it is wise to have Scrolls or items that can grant the following:  Immunity to Mind Affecting Spells (Lesser Mind Blank, Clarity, Protection from Evil, etc.), Immunity to Death Magic (Belt of Guiding Light, Death Ward, etc.), and items that may grant some form of Damage Resistance, such as Swordsman's Belt, Brawlers Belt or Archers Belt.  I will try to seek one of each and, if available, the Greater versions of these.  <br><br>In most of the builds outlined in this thread, the characters have the ability to cast Arcane and Divine scrolls.  This provides for huge flexibility.  This means you can cast the best buffs.  Typically, things like Stoneskin, Greater Stoneskin, Improved Invis, Premonition, Shadowshield, Bulls, Cats, Flame Weapon/Darkfire/Divine Favor/Bless Weapon, etc.  If you can find them, and if you can afford it, I will try to find such scrolls and stockpile them.  If not, I have been known to take Scribe Scroll and make my own.  In the Cleric build, how cool is it to have him Scribe a 10-pack of Divine Powers or Darkfires, and thus save his spell slots for other spells or Spontaneous Heals?<br><br>But much of this is environment dependent.  Some of this you'll be able to do, and some of it not.  You have to be semi-familiar with the limitations and magic levels of your world.<br><br>Feel free to ask more questions.  There's plenty of veterans around here that can add more than what I can.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
