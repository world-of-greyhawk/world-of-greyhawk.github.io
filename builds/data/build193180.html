Monk speed appears to still work in heavy armor.. I had great fun when I got bored putting my monk in heavy armor and grab a greatsword and just stand around speeding after people to scare em <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>-DaMouse

With regards to the empty hands and the kama i suggested: when i was posting the build, it was late!  The wpn you take is up to you, but unarmed and kama really wouldnt fit (after reflection).  If you were to take them as focus, you wouldnt need black guard lvls.  The build is to use a class in a different way, not to maximize your ab or ac or whatever.  <br><br>Why i took battleaxe?  Simply the critcal *3.  I get frustrated, as of late, with the seemingly wimpy output of critting with a scrimter for 20!   If i had done this a few months ago, i am sure i would have tried to work it with a bastard sword or kukris!  <br><br>Peace

You have a decent amount of skill points, I'd say change the build like this:<br><br>01 cleric1 extra turning [str / protection], power attack<br>02 monk1<br>03 monk2 wpn prof: Exotic<br><br>And then change the weapon you use to Dwarven Waraxe.<br><br>2 more dmg per round in exchange for 8 skill points, I think it's worth it.

You could take toughness instead of martial at level one, switch your cleric level to level 6, then take weapon prof exotic at level 3, extra turning at level 6, and weapon focus dwarven waraxe at level 9.  Or keep the cleric level at 3, and push weapon prof exotic to 6.  I prefer the former so you can get your hands on the waraxe sooner.  But you can definitely do it without losing skill points or changing much else.<br><br>Steve

Cool, dig the build!<br><br>As for monk speed in armor, the game is apparently bugged in this respect.  You *do* get to keep your speed, on occasion.  Sometimes yes, sometimes no.  Usually, to get it to come back if it goes away on login, just un-equip and re-equip your armor, and voila!  Monk speed once again.  Cheesy but doable.<br><br>I definitely wouldn't go kama as it's a terrible weapon without the extra monk attacks, which you lose in armor.  <br><br>I was thinking of something like this (I've recently gottne into evil characters) and will try this out.  <br><br>K'<br><br>Edit: Important safety tip: never try to type after a loooong flight and no sleep <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br>_________________<br>"I replaced the headlights in my car with strobe lights, so it looks like I'm the only one moving." <br>--Stephen Wright<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By K'orwyn on 05/05/05 13:41</span></i></p>

Switching the levels around to cleric37/monk1/BG2<br>gives you tons of magic, the same attack schedule, and nearly the same saves (losing some reflex not so bad with evasion) and the SR with one spell becomes 49. Zen archery/divine spells/feats are a nasty alternative to the damage shield types too.

I took monk for the speed.  The 7 bg lvls were to get 4 atts/rd.  I havent tried your suggestion yet, but im certain you cant get 4 atts with cleric lvld to 37, no mattter how you do it (you need 4 ftr lvls min to do it, as far as i know).

Not sure which, but Divine Favor or Divine power (cleric spell levels 1 and 4 respectively) give you a fighter's AB, even if they dont show it on the character sheet. Actually, these two spells in conjunction cause your AB to go up considerably higher than your average pure melee type build.
