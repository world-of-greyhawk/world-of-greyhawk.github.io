Hey guys I though I would have fun trying to use the Harper Scout Prestige Class.  The first build that I posted on this forum was prety rough so I tried to take into account things everyone said and put them to good use in this build.  I also didnt see this class combination in the list.

A quite interesting build, specialy for RP, but i dont think blinding speed is worth it though, I would rather get energy resistance or armor skin.

You can only exchange another SD bonus feat for Epic Shadowlord here. In fact the epic shadowlord that does not have concealment is almost the same defensively as the level 10 non epic summon. So using an epic feat on it is pretty much a waste of time  unless <br><br>1/ bioware fix the Epic Shadowlord to have concealment<br>2/ you have more shadowdancer levels than you have here.<br><br>They both have the same immunities and resistances so they both stand up to similar punishment. The epic shadowlord has more hit points and a better offense (still nothing that will threaten anything that isnt already trivial for the shadowdancer) the non epic has weak offense and concealment. <br><br>Otherwise pretty neat build.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!
