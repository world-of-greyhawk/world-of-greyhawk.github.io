The doors of the grand audience hall opened, and the court herald announced our entrance:  "My Lord, the honorable Knights of Torm, Sir Reginald and Lady Kalinda, as you requested."<br><br>All eyes were on us, the nobles and courtiers of the royal court sizing up the fabled Tormite Crusaders, I guess.  I could hear the whispering about it as we passed.  What are a pair of Crusaders doing here?  Apparently they didn't know what was going on or that we'd been summoned.  A few recognized Kalinda by reputation... she was something of a living legend for her swordsmanship.<br><br>Certainly some where scheming of how they might use us to their advantage while we were here by involving us in their plotting.  Royal courts were always as such, even in goodly lands such as these.  And these good lands were threatened by something... the King Benefice had sent an urgent personal request for aid against a dark enemy to our Order, and something about the request had prompted the prelate to dispatch us - two battle-hardened Knight Crusaders, Kalinda a masterful warrior and myself, a devoted wielder of divine magic.<br><br>I could sense Kalinda getting even more tense as we walked down the columnade to the throne.  She no doubt felt naked without her armor or especially her sword, and although she would appear serene and graceful to a stranger, I knew better.  She had little patience for high society and the trappings of court, even though she would play along.<br><br>"We humbly greet your Majesty," I said when we reached the throne.  "The prelate bid us make all haste from our Chapterhouse to answer your summons.  While we are here, we are at you service."  We bowed to one knee in unision.<br><br>A murmur ran through the crowd.  I was certain they had no idea why we had come.<br><br>"It is an honor to be here," Kalinda added.  We had worked out ahead of time that I would do most of the talking, but she would still have to fulfil the expectations of a courtly knight.<br><br>"Welcome to Castanya, noble Knights.  The Crusaders of Torm are famed far and wide for their devotion to justice and duty," The King intoned formally.  "Guest quarters are being prepared for you in the palace, and you are welcome to travel freely throughout the kingdom.  I have many matters of state to attend to this afternoon, but I invite you to join me for dinner and a private audience afterward.  Both of your reputations precede you; I am most interested in hearing about some of your adventures."<br><br>So we'd be getting the details of the summons in private.  I nodded, "We glady accept your gracious offer, Majesty.  Your hospitality is most appreciated."  And, rising, we were guided to our quarters by a servant.<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "219059", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Continue...</a><br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Xylophone on 11/04/05 06:57</span></i></p>
