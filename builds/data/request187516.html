Hi all,<br><br>Looking for a good build for the pw I play: Three Towns. Dev crit is disabled and it's a low magic world. I've been told pure fighters don't do well but I'm looking for a powerful build with little or no buffing needed (no monk please). Also been told str based do much better than dex. Thanks for any suggestions.

23paladin/2bard/15rdd should be your best bet at a high AB machine without dev crit. Remember to take 14 wisdom because the paladin spells offer great AB boosting. With all buffs for the paladin and a heavy str from both feats, ability points and rdd bonus, you would wander around with 65-68 AB. getting tumble from bard and AC bonus from rdd lvls as well is a fairly good thing. AC will be better than normal warriors. Be sure to take 20 paladin lvls first and then 1 bard lvl(max tumble here) and then take Rdd all the way to 15. After that use the rest of your paladin lvls and at lvl 40 take bard. the bard lvl can also be taken at lvl 37, because that would max tumble to 40 ranks.

Thanks Kalmar,<br><br>Did you have a specific build in mind so I know what feats are best? Very much a noob to NWN. Thanks again.<br><br>ps Do you think this Paladin Build would be better than a ftr/rogue/wpn master build?

You can't do paladin/bard since bard has to be unlawful &gt;_&lt;<br><br>Cleric bard rdd ends up pretty neat though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>-DaMouse

Well the difference between a 1*ftr/rogue/WM and a 2*pally/sorc/rdd is that 1* has a better chance of killing if the AC is no higher than 40 AC or something within the range of that. I just think the 2* offers more in terms of "raw" power. I like the high base dmg...i really do <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">
