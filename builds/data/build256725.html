Now there are some fast and easy tweaks to be made here if you need something with a better punch.<br><br>1. Drop INT to 14 and bump up STR.<br>2. At level 10, instead take Weapon Specialization.<br>3. At level 21, take Epic Weapon Focus and Epic Weapon Specialization.<br><br>You'll lose some hit points in the end, but maybe you need the damage output.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

I did say this was a high-magic server.  Weapons are quite common with multiple damage types doing quite close to 40 to 60 points damage per hit, even with strengths as low as 6.

Folks, to be fair to reggemS, he does say in the very first line of the build post:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Built for a high-magic server where weapons with high damage are common...</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>so, yes, a 14 AB at level 1 is probably reasonable to assume in that environment. It's +7 with no gear at all, so getting +7 more from a weapon and some DEX gear shouldn't be all that difficult to achieve in a high magic setting.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Well if you say so.....<br>If that's what he starts with it's playable on <i>that</i>  high magic server, but not generally. Even in most high magic server this guy would suffer from serious playability issues <b>early on</b>. They might even have level restrictions on. I'm not saying anything bad about the build, just that it needs a few levels to become playable. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Sure. I've only had limited experience with high magic servers, but the couple I was on started you off with +3 or better gear. So, with a +3 Bracer and +3 Monk boots, that's +3 DEX bonus right there. Add in a +3 weapons, and you get +6 to your AB right off for a total of +13 AB without any magic effects active (Bless, Cat's Grace, etc.)<br><br>I agree that this is very environment specific, and not at all playable in any other kind of environment though.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
