Ok. <br><br>I've been trying to figure out the best class combination to achieve the highest possible AC in a +5 environment. <br><br>Now I am not looking for a playable character at all, just to see what could be the highest achievable. <br><br>Some things to consider that could be accepted are that they can be buffed from another source, eg. a 30th level Bard for +7 Bard AC Bonus (Dodge), if you understand my meaning.<br><br>No class or alignment restrictions, just a challenge really.<br><br>I had considered Monk, Bard, PM or Monk, Wiz, PM with an external 30th Bard Song. Hitting the 100 point mark, but I'm sure it can be beaten.<br><br>Any suggestions? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

How much +stat gear is available?  Can you only max 1 stat?  Or could you get +12 to two different ones?  Or are you not allowed to get any +stat gear at all?<br><br>*edit* Also, do you consider -AB from Curse Song to be equivalent to AC?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Nimueh_Leafbow on 04/13/07 20:56</span></i></p>

I know this is just an AC challenge, but I consider a high AC + Epic Dodge is way better for defense than a higher AC wiht no Epic Dodge, mainly because when you reach the "untouchable" values Epic Dodge will allow to you evade even for rolls of 20.

I think you have 10 dodge ac used, so someone could cast around a few undeaths eternal foe. 125 ac. Not that it will ever help you though.

Hmmmm, it may have been with +20 stuff now that I think about it. Even so, you really don't need anything higher than 21 + the highest possible AB to be basically unhittable. I believe the highest possible AB is an AA build with +89. So, an AC of 110 should be plenty.<br><br>*edit* Anyway, I think the classes he used were Bard, PM, and possibly Druid. Just can't recall for certain, and I can't seem to find the post.

That's ridiculous AC, let's not say only Epic Dodge, if you're already over 110 at least get yourself Epic Energy Resistance instead of Armor Skin, seriously.

I could swear Improved Expertise counted against your dodge cap.  Plus, there's a lot more interesting things you can do if you have +5 items rather than +20.  If you get all +20, alternate sources of AC are irrelevant.<br><br>Let's look at Evo's build from the link for an example.  In a +20 world:<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Most ac is an elf-dex based bard */rdd 8 /pm 28<br>start with 20 dex and take 6 great dex feats<br>Lets look at this<br>10 Base<br>20 Deflection<br>20 Armor<br>20 Shield<br>20 Natural<br>20 Dodge<br>19(48 dex after +12 dex equipment)<br>2 Armor Skin<br>3 RDD<br>16 PM<br>10 Imp Evasion<br>8 Tumble<br>= 168 AC<br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>In a +5 world you get:<br>10 Base<br>5 Deflection<br>5 Armor<br>5 Shield<br>5 Natural<br>5 Dodge<br>19(48 dex after +12 dex equipment)<br>2 Armor Skin<br>3 RDD<br>16 PM<br>10 Imp Evasion<br>8 Tumble<br>= 93 AC<br><br>So, you see, there's a horrible inflation that occurs.  Even with a starting 174, you're really looking at a big ol' -75 AC to that, so it's more like 99 in a +5 environ.

Yeah, in a +5 world bard11/RDD1/pm 28 would do way better than that one. Uhm.. way better being abit better. <br>Since you'd actually get bard song and some other spells. 108 ac actually.. Max dex and a +5 towershield does wonders.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kramsikrams on 05/30/07 19:38</span></i></p>

Out of curiosity. Does dodge (the feat) count towards the dodge ac cap?

Mhm..Can't remember why I asked anymore. Anyway, I'll post a build soon which can gain 109 ac with +5 stuff, and who also got a nice ac, moderatly good ab (Enough to hit someone with it) and he got 11 bard levels, so he isn't totally useless with mundane stuff.

So, it seems someone made almost the exactly same build a few weeks ago. Only difference is the dex and cha. And the fact that he get more ac without any magical stuff at all. Mine could with magical items.. but that is hardly anything to be proud off. A shame the build was not in the search thingy yet
