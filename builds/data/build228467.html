Risen shape if i'm not wrong gives you different STR/DEX values so specializing in those 2 abilities won't do anything (I think).<br><br>Also, you can get risen shape with 10 levels already if yu take 10th shifter on an epic feat level (e.g. 21,24,27....)<br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while

Why not take Weapon Proficiency: Exotic earlier, say in place of Alertness? Then focus on scythe right away instead of sickle, saving a feat for something else? Or if you want a 1-handed weapon for use while in human form, why not Scim instead of Sickle so you at least get a good crit range?<br><br>TM

Alertness is a shifter prerequisite and the guy evidently wants to get 4 attacks per round, so there's no way to get WF: scythe straight away.<br><br>I agree about changing sickle for scimitar.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 01/27/06 17:02</span></i></p>

You're right about scimitar being better than sickle.  I just figured you'd hardly ever use it, anyway, and sickle is sort of the most "druidy" weapon.<br><br>As for taking Weapon Proficiency (exotic) earlier, you can't.  Due to an obnoxious feature of the class, Druids are unable to take any additional weapon proficiencies.  Since the Shifter prestige class is basically just an extension of the Druid in NwN, they decided to keep that disadvantage for Druid/Shifters.  Only after taking a level of WM can this build take Weapon Proficiency (exotic).<br><br>@GhostNWN, Risen Lord shape replaces your str and your con, not your dex, so going the dex route is probably most effective.  Or, if you wanted, you could take up to 21 con and get Epic Damage Reduction, then pour the rest into dex.  It's really up to you:  Do you want high AC, Epic DR, or Dev Crit?<br><br>*edit* Taking Undead Shape at Shifter 10:  Are you sure?  The manual (yeah, I know) says it requires "Epic Shifter," which ought to mean level 11.  It's been wrong before, though...all the time.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Nimueh_Leafbow on 01/27/06 22:29</span></i></p>

Okay, I tested taking Undead Shape at Shifter 10, and it works.  I also decided that a DC 35 dev crit isn't worth having, but as I posted above, the dex version has already been done, so here's a DR version which takes into account the advice I've recieved:<br><br>-----<br><br>Race:  Human<br><br>Alignment:  Neutral Good, Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral, or Neutral Evil<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>Str:  8<br>Dex:  15<br>Con:  16<br>Wis:  14<br>Int:  14<br>Cha:  8<br><br>1 - Druid 1 - Dodge, Mobility<br>2 - Druid 2<br>3 - Druid 3 - Alertness<br>4 - Druid 4 - Con 17<br>5 - Druid 5<br>6 - Shifter 1 / Druid 5 - Weapon Focus (scimitar)<br>7 - Shifter 2 / Druid 5<br>8 - Shifter 3 / Druid 5 - Con 18<br>9 - Shifter 4 / Druid 5 - Spring Attack<br>10 - Druid 6 / Shifter 4<br>11 - Druid 7 / Shifter 4<br>12 - Shifter 5 / Druid 7 - Expertise, Con 19<br>13 - Shifter 6 / Druid 7<br>14 - Shifter 7 / Druid 7<br>15 - Shifter 8 / Druid 7 - Whirlwind Attack<br>16 - WM 1 / Shifter 8 / Druid 7 - Con 20<br>17 - WM 2 / Shifter 8 / Druid 7 - Weapon of Choice (scimitar)*<br>18 - WM 3 / Shifter 8 / Druid 7 - Weapon Proficiency (exotic)<br>19 - WM 4 / Shifter 8 / Druid 7<br>20 - WM 5 / Shifter 8 / Druid 7 - Con 21<br><br>21 - Shifter 9 / Druid 7 / WM 5 - Improved Critical (scythe)<br>22 - WM 6 / Shifter 9 / Druid 7<br>23 - WM 7 / Shifter 9 / Druid 7<br>24 - Shifter 10 / WM 7 / Druid 7 - Undead Shape, Dex 16<br>25 - WM 8 / Shifter 10 / Druid 7<br>26 - WM 9 / Shifter 10 / Druid 7<br>27 - WM 10 / Shifter 10 / Druid 7 - Weapon Focus (scythe)<br>28 - WM 11 / Shifter 10 / Druid 7 - Dex 17<br>29 - WM 12 / Shifter 10 / Druid 7<br>30 - WM 13 / Shifter 10 / Druid 7 - Epic Damage Reduction I, Weapon of Choice (scythe)*<br>31 - WM 14 / Shifter 10 / Druid 7<br>32 - WM 15 / Shifter 10 / Druid 7 - Dex 18<br>33 - WM 16 / Shifter 10 / Druid 7 - Epic Damage Reduction II, Epic Weapon Focus (scythe)*<br>34 - WM 17 / Shifter 10 / Druid 7<br>35 - WM 18 / Shifter 10 / Druid 7<br>36 - WM 19 / Shifter 10 / Druid 7 - Epic Damage Reduction III, Armor Skin*, Dex 19<br>37 - WM 20 / Shifter 10 / Druid 7<br>38 - WM 21 / Shifter 10 / Druid 7<br>39 - WM 22 / Shifter 10 / Druid 7 - Blind Fight, Epic Prowess*<br>40 - Druid 8 / WM 22 / Shifter 10 - Dex 20<br><br>Skills:  Animal Empathy 43(42), Concentration 43(47), Discipline 42(47), Heal 38(40), Intimidate 4(3), Spellcraft 43(45), Tumble 20(25)<br><br>Ending Stats:<br>Str:  8<br>Dex:  20<br>Con:  21<br>Wis:  14<br>Int:  14<br>Cha:  8 <br><br>Ending Stats (shifted):<br>Str:  21<br>Dex:  20<br>Con:  19<br>Wis:  14<br>Int:  14<br>Cha:  8<br><br>-----<br><br>AB (Risen Lord Scythe):  +45/+40/+35/+30<br><br>Damage (Risen Lord Scythe):  2d4+12 (critical 17-20/x5)<br><br>AC (shifted):  34<br><br>Saves (shifted):<br>Fortitude:  26 (+9 vs. spells)<br>Reflex:  27 (+9 vs. spells)<br>Will:  20 (+9 vs. spells)<br><br>Max HP (shifted):  584<br><br>DR:  <br>Epic DR:  9/-<br>Risen Lord DR:  15/+3

There are definately some things that could be done to make the devcrit more viable.<br><br>A common tip is to remember what items shift fully.<br><br>Something many people forget about is that weapon stats DO shift, therefore if you can find a weapon with a strength bonus on it, that would help you reach +12 above the risen lords natural str score more easily.<br><br>Furthermore, ANY devcrit is better than none at all.

Well, it's been a few months since I posted this (it's a good idea to look at the date when you post!), but I'll take a stab at these:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/02/06 23:46:23 (GMT) -- Elanthil Seldavius<br><br>Something many people forget about is that weapon stats DO shift, therefore if you can find a weapon with a strength bonus on it, that would help you reach +12 above the risen lords natural str score more easily.<br><br>Furthermore, ANY devcrit is better than none at all.

Actually, Risen Lord merges everything that a shifter shape can possibly merge, so your str bonus doesn't have to be on your weapon, it can be on anything but (if I remember correctly) your gauntlets or an off-hand weapon.  But even though you can get +12 str, <i>so can everyone else</i>, and they're still going to be starting at a higher base DC.  So, the point is, your DC is ALWAYS going to be 2 points lower than the regular minimum for the feat, and I'd say at least 5 points lower than it needs to be in order to be worth the feat investment.  Also, Dev Crit on a scythe is dreadfully inefficient anyway, because of the low threat range and high multiplier (you won't get many crits, and the ones you get will generally kill them anyway).<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/02/06 23:46:23 (GMT) -- Elanthil Seldavius<br><br>Overall I give this build a 9.<br>I'm going to build it and rebuild it myself several different ways in test programs and see what I can come up with.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Have a good time.

Going any race other than human means I lose 1 pre-epic feat.  I have to take Alertness early to qualify for Shifter, so I'm already taking WM as early as possible as a human.  So, if I lose my human bonus feat, I can't take WM until level 19.  That means that I have to take 18 levels in some combination of Druid and Shifter, both of which have 3/4 AB progression.  There ain't no way to take 18 levels in 3/4 classes without losing at least 5 BAB, so I would end up with pre-epic BAB 15.  Do you know what happens at pre-epic BAB 15?  I'll tell you what:  You lose 1 APR.<br><br>Incidentally, those 18 levels would also have to be Druid 8 / Shifter 10 in order to keep the current level split, and since that would keep you from taking Shifter 10 in epic, it would be impossible for the build to take Undead Shape, which it seems to me would kind of defeat the purpose.<br><br>Now let's see what you gain by going Dwarf, as you suggested:  A small save bonus vs. spells and a +2 con bonus that gives you precisely 0 HP when shifted because Risen Lord form overrides your base con.<br><br>No, I think I'll stay with human.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/02/06 23:46:23 (GMT) -- Elanthil Seldavius<br><br>A possible option for this build would be to shift the levels around a bit and try to get either dragon shape or construct shape as well...OR to focus on kobold command AND risen lord, giving you two excellent shapes to work with.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Construct Shape requires 27 wis, and Dragon Shape takes 30.  In order to get that, I'd have to change the focus of the build and take a whole bunch of Great Wisdoms as epic feats.  You're not talking about "shifting the levels around a bit," you're talking about a completely different build.<br><br>As for the kobold, you have to take 17 levels in shifter to get the improved version (and the basic one isn't good for much).

Dev Crit is stupid for Scythe builds. The whole point of the Scythe WM is to be able to do massive damage on a critical. Devestating Critical ontop of a x5 multiplier is redundant and makes me gooey with rage.<br><br>Dex is good and all, but not worth it. Nope. It isn't.<br><br>Constitution though... if you get the 9/- DR, then couple that with your Druids Stoneskin if you get that far, plus the 50% damage immunity from the Risen Lord... ouch! Ouch, I say.
