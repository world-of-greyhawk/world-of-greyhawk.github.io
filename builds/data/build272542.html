<i>Delivering a stunning performance and liberating foreign peoples (1-40) PvM and PvP </i><br><br><b>GREEN BERET (Torm’s Special Operative)</b><br><b>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar</b><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; *Credits: I'd like to thank Tatooed Monk, whose comments and tireless work on a variety of characters that we are together developing for our joint "Wildwood series" have likewise been valuable to this build, such that TM deserves credit for this build, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">             </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Concept:<br><br><i> As a member of Torm’s Special Forces, the prime mission of the Green Beret, Special Operative, is to train and assist foreign indigenous forces – in other words, a disciplined freedom fighter, providing counsel, assistance and training on behalf of his/her government and Torm, to all those who want to be free, in Torm's name—their motto being: De Oppresso Liber (“to free from oppression”). </i><br><br><br>The Build:<br><br>While not the first to utilize the CoT/Ranger/Monk combo (there being two others: <br>Bane Of Sneaky Types (Ranger 21 / Champion of Torm 18 / Monk 1), <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "212750", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> by Jennalee, and Tormite Hawkeye (Ranger 10 / Monk 12 / Champion of Torm 18), <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "232445", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> by Saosin777), the Operative is quite unique: with higher natural AB, a higher dev crit DC (as high as it gets for a human melee’r in fact), and the full benefit of the monk’s unarmed strike table/damage, among many other differences. <br><br>In fact, the Operative (strength based) enjoys not just one, but two weapon foci (Unarmed and Kama), with a Dev.Crit DC 42 (48 w. str. items), with an alternative option provided for you to enjoy three weapon foci (i.e., to deal two different damage types, in addition to your unarmed strike, in lieu of dev.crit.). While HPs are decent, and so, too, is AC (being mediocre for a monk perhaps, but on par with a plate-wielding melee’r), Operative comes equipped with high saves, monk speed, decent skills (incl. pretty good stealth and strong trapping), a very nice AB (especially for a monk), and, being strength based with 9 apr (10 hasted), s/he has the very real potential to deal exceptional damage – unarmed especially, but also kamas. The main draw back of this build is that, like most melee builds, Operative lacks UMD/magic access, apart from ranger buffs (and ranger scrolls i.e., aid, blade thirst, etc.), and thus no real way apart from equipment to raise his/her own AB; on the other hand, while the lack of UMD may be frustrating to some, it’s not terribly so, since Operative’s a monk (hence, entitled to full use of all monk equipment) with high saves, speed, and natural AB/damage all his/her own. <br><br>For those who prefer a more traditional monk, with the characteristically high AC, a DEX based variant follows (which is rather similar to the STR variant, albeit s/he has -1 AB and far less damage output as compared to the STR variant, but in turn enjoys a higher AC, among other differences). Without any further ado, please meet: <br><br><br>GREEN BERET (Torm’s Special Operative)<br>Champion of Torm(14), Ranger(10), Monk(16)<br><br>Race: Human; Alignment: Any Lawful (theme: Lawful Neutral or Lawful Good)<br><br>I.

Thanks, Grim -- indeed, the str. based one w. ranger (hence, a dev.critter, dual-wielder, and not at all feat starved well … s/he not only be cool, but really (and I say this most humbly), s/he cleans up (even I must admit, after taking him out a few times now, and after testing him/her thoroughly in that uber-charged Arena of Commche's too (well, let’s just say, although it took awhile to sell me on str-based rangers, heh, I’m just as if not even more sold on str-based monks - thanks! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">     )<br><br>As to the dex-one, why not ftr instead of ranger? Great question, and there be a few reasons, least of all (indeed) the skills (like traps!), and also innate ranger buff’s (i.e. not only for some serious stealth, see below, but also Cat’s – boost to AB, AC (and reflex, stealth and … did I mention, traps! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">     -- really, all fun aside, them buffs, while not exactly are what rangers get something to write home about (as compared to say what a paladin gets), but still, something rangers get that ftrs don’t and of course can be quite useful I find, especially on a dexer – i.e., Cat’s, for eg., boosts not only your AC and reflex, but also stealth, traps, and AB all by +2, which isn’t too shabby. <br><br>That said, while FTR for WS/EWS be nice of course (indeed, worth a look me thinks, too, and we’ll build it together, ‘kay? You and I def. be due! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     While a nice variant, I don’t think, that said, it’s superior to what the Ranger gives us, since we’ve not only dem useful buffs, but also (and incl) some serious trapping/stealth skills, which (in my opinion) be just as if not better than WS/EWS -- that said, dex-based monk/ftrs are def. viable, too, don’t get me wrong but,  if it’s “in your face” so to speak melee damage a player wants, well, that’s the str-based version of course. <br><br>With that, in light of the str. version, I wanted to do something a little different for the dexer, something that was/is a little unique – hence, ranger/monk w. (thanks to ranger buffs) wonderful stealth, buffed AB/AC, and also deadly trap skills (which, depending on one’s preferences and style of course, traps make up for ie WS/EWS … (and hence, the ranger for that – so much to this class, as I know that you know, it’s just wonderful really; then, we already know about my love affair w. dem monks, and yet here be but just one more example of why ranger’s be one of me favorites, too (str. based w. dev crit –or- dex based w. the deadly traps, either way, enjoy! ~ Tyr <br><br>(here what I be talking about, re: stealth and trapping “skills” <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>DEX-Based Ranger/Monk:<br><br>Stealth:<br>Hide 54 (+16 cat’s, one-w., and camou., or(: 70 adjusted<br>M/S 54 (+6 cat’s, one-w., or): 60 adj.<br><br>Traps 25 (+2 Cat’s, +4 one-w-land, or): 31 Adjusted (self-buffs only) -- bring on dex items and jumps to 35 (i.e., NOT counting any rogue rings/amulets or anything of the sort, merely, what Beret can do, which is as follows (i.e., self-buffed 31, followed by dex boost 35):<br><br>Trap Type (Trap Strength/Damage)--Set DC (self-buff 31) / Dex boost Only (35)<br><br>- Acid Blob	Strong, 30 (12d6 acid, single creature); 	Deadly 35 (single, 18d6)<br>- Acid Splash 	Deadly, 30 (8d8 acid, single)<br>- Electrical	Strong, 30 (20d6, 15’ radius); 			Deadly, 35 (30d6, 15’ radius)<br>- Fire 		Strong, 30 (15d6, 15’ radius); 			Deadly 35 (25d6, 15’ radius)<br>- Frost		Deadly 30 (8d4 single, plus chance of paralysis 4 rounds)<br>- Holy		Deadly 30  (9d4 divine (12d10 if undead)<br>- Negative	Deadly 30 (8d6 negative, and chance of -1 level drain)<br>- Sonic		Deadly 30 (8d4 sonic, and chance of stun, 4 rounds)<br>- Spike		Strong 25 (5d6 piercing); Deadly 35 25d6<br>- Tangle		Deadly 30 (slow, 5 rounds; 10’ radius)<br>- Gas	Minor, 30 (poison, 15’ radius, chance of 1d6+1d6 dex drain / Avg, 35: chance of 1d6+2d6 con drain)<br><br>For more info, see: <a href="http://www.nwnwiki.org/Trap#Notes" target="_blank">http://www.nwnwiki.org/Trap#Notes</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 05/05/07 05:12</span></i></p>

The extra skillpoints is nice for sure. as is trap setting skills. I just wondered, never said Fighter was superior. You get enough feats with CoT I think. 6 damage is just a huge amount in a dexer like this. And let me say: 10 ranger doesn't exactly give you mmany spells. 2/1 iirc.<br><br>Anyhow, all over good builds, I personally don't like dexers like this though, no offense. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Actually, never think I ever played a dexer without Rogue or  assassin in it. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"><br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again

In general, I prefer my dex builds to get ED. Without it, I don't find the extra AC points worth the loss of damage output.<br><br>For this build, I really like the Str-version. The Ranger lets you leave Dex at 10 and get Str up to 34 (vs. 30-32 for most Str-fighters). Add on the 10 attacks per round, high Str-damage, and Dev Crit (even with the low crit-range of a kama, you will get a few per round at 10 attacks), and he can really tear through the mobs. Nice AB, too, and AC really won't be that bad once you buff, and use Monk Robes, boots, etc. It'll be 10 or so less than the dex build, but the damage output will mean enemies don't get to live long enough to get many hits in.<br><br>TM
