<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>I gave an earlier idea of how I would do a ranger/assassin but here it is in full detail. The first variant is the ranger/assassin, the second is a ranger/rogue. Feel free to critique as you would like. <br><br>I'd go with a panther companion on both of these builds. The hit points are kind of low but okay (what do you expect from an elf?). Both builds have low saves, but this is unavoidable. This character has serious feat deficiency but should be okay. I went for maces because I didn't have the feats to spend on improved criticals and very few enemies have bludgeoning resistance. The second build also has an XP penalty.<br><br><b>Shadow of the Underdark V.1</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Elf (Subrace: Drow)<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Any Evil<br><br><i>Base Attribute</i><br>STR 14  <br>DEX 17 <br>CON 10 <br>WIS 14 <br>INT 14 <br>CHA 8<br><br><i>Leveling Guide</i><br>Levels 1-20 Ranger<br>Level 21 Assassin<br>Level 22-23 Shadow Dancer<br>Level 24-38 Assassin<br>Level 39 Ranger<br>Level 40 Assassin<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Assassin 17/Ranger 21/Shadow Dancer 2<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>All 10 go to Dexterity<br><br><i>Feats</i><br>Level 1: Weapon Finesse, Favoured Enemy (Undead)<br>Level 3: Power Attack<br>Level 5: Favoured Enemy (Construct)<br>Level 6: Improved Power Attack<br>Level 9: Weapon Focus (Mace)<br>Level 10: Favoured Enemy (Outsider)<br>Level 12: Dodge<br>Level 15: Mobility, Favoured Enemy (Dragon)<br>Level 18: Weapon Focus (Longbow)<br>Level 20: Favoured Enemy (Elemental)<br>Level 21: Epic Weapon Focus (Mace)<br>Level 24: Epic Weapon Focus (Longbow)<br>Level 27: Epic Prowess<br>Level 30: Great Dexterity I<br>Level 33: Great Dexterity II<br>Level 36: Great Dexterity III, Armor Skin<br>Level 39: Bane of Enemies<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 14<br>DEX 30<br>CON 10<br>WIS 14<br>INT 14<br>CHA 8<br><br><i>Final Saves</i><br>Fortitude 22<br>Reflexes 26<br>Will 18<br><br><i>AB and Damage</i><br><br>(No buffs, two normal maces)<br>42/37/32/27 2+1D6 (+9D6 Death Attack) (20 X2)<br>42/37 1+1D6 (+9D6 Death Attack) (20 X2)<br>(44/39/34/29 7+3D6 (+9D6 Death Attack) Vs.

Made a build similar to your second one.<br>Few minor differences, the main one is that its based for PvP, yet playable from 1-40<br><br>Rng21/Sd1/Rog19<br><br>Race:Halfling<br>Alignment: Neutral Evil<br>Starting Stats:<br>STR:6<br>DEX:20<br>CON:10<br>WIS:14<br>INT:14<br>CHA:8<br><br>Leveling: 1-20 Ranger. 21 Rogue, 22 Shadowdancer, 23-38 Rogue, 39 Ranger, 40 Rogue.

Tumble, Hide, Move Silent on Rogue/SD levels, you'll have enough extra points to cap almost 2 other skills, I reccomend one being Set Traps but its all personal choice.<br><br>Ending Stats:<br><br>STR:6<br>DEX:32<br>CON:10<br>WIS:14<br>INT:14<br>CHA:8<br><br>Saves: Fort 23 / Reflex 28 / 18 Will Unbuffed.<br>AB: 41 Holding 2 Generic Handaxe's. 45 With 1. (+1 from Halfling Racial which i dont belive shows on char sheet so they're 42/46 Respictivly) Self Buffs will add another +1 from Aid.<br><br>AC: 29 Naked (30 with Halfing Bonus again not showing on char sheet i belive)<br><br>9D6 Sneak Attacks.<br><br>Hide is 69 Self Buffed, +4 While outdoors from Ranger Class.<br>(43 Base + 12 From Dex + 14 from Buffs +2 Halfling racial)<br><br>Move Silent is 59 Buffed, and again +4 while outdoors.<br><br>The build is heavily reliant on HiPS, and excels on servers where Trueseeing has been altered to 3.5 Compliance.

Wow, the first time this build gets commented on is when someone else posts a build similar to it.  Not that I mind, but you would be better off posting it as a separate build so we can comment on it properly and without confusion.  It isn't one of my better builds and has its problems, let this build return to its silent slumber <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_sleep2.gif"><br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

From the revised rles in the announcement at the top of the page:<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br><b><i>D.</i> It must be an original build</b><br><br><b>•</b> The build must stand out compared to similar ones because of some significant differences.<br><b>•</b> Similar builds should be researched using <a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/search/builds.htm" target="_blank">pulse cap’s search engine</a> and browsing the most recent builds that have not made it yet into the search engine.<br><b>•</b> Links to similar builds must be given in the build’s post.<br><b>•</b> <b><i>A build which ends up to be the same as an already exsisting one a few minor tweaks apart should not be posted. Such tweaks should instead be suggested as a reply post in the original build thread.</i></b><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->This is because it's useless to have duplicate builds not to say it doesn't credit the OP of the first build. Also, the rule means to go and suggest the tweaks in the OP not to post the "tweaked" build in its entirety. Thank you for your attention.<br><br><br>EDIT: to be clear, what we want to avoid is for example a caster build reposted with Maximize spell taken instead of Empower in the OP, or a melee build with Disarm/ID taken instead of Expertise/IE and so on. If your "new" build is the same as an already posted build go and suggest those few minow tweaks in the OP (like: "you know I think expertise would serve you better because..." or "IMO this build could make great use of Disarm, if you just give up..." or "nice build, myself I prefer maximize spell over empower cause I like my damage output to be consistent..."... you get it). If you think that you managed to get a build which, although similar, is still sufficiently different from others already posted go and post it, but put in links to similar builds. If a moderator thinks the build is too similar to an already exsisting one, the post will be moved to Build Request Forum and you will be invited to post your tweaks suggestions in the OP of the elder build.<br><br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "250334", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builds Posting Rules</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 08/30/06 16:46</span></i></p>
