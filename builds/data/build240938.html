<b>Playable from Levels 1-40... PvM or PvP</b><br><br>I was kind of surprised to see that very few builds with these classes had been posted, there is <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "117736", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>one</a> but it goes for devastating critical.  I belaboured over the balance of the strength and charisma totals, which could be modified to suit play style.  In the end, I wanted a high enough charisma that I could get a defensive bonus from Divine Shield, while still managing an above average AB.  The build should be really strong in no to mid magic settings, once you start getting +10 equipment you will start hitting caps and the build will lose its effectiveness.  The weakness for this build is wizards and sorcerers, if it weren't for Acid Sheath (hard to use holy sword against that kind of reciprocal damage), the Bigby's spells (Even with RDD strength, I don't like his odds of making that STR check, though buffed I believe the odds are in his favor) and IGMS (he can take two, but more than that would be lethal) he would stand a good chance.  Another potential weakness is shadowdancers, but if he can buy a couple scrolls of trueseeing he can manage against them quite readily.  <br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-Good AB.  A 45 AB is pretty good, on top of that he can add paladin buffs and taunt<br>-Good AC.  With +5 equipment he can manage a 61 AC, this can be increased to 73 through the use of divine shield.  Without any magical equipment he can manage a 50 AC buffed. <br>-Level 4 Paladin Spells.  He has access to many cleric buffs as well as holy sword.  Also his caster level is high enough that only Mordenkainen's Disjunction can remove the buffs.<br>-Level 2 Bard Spells.  He has to take off his armor to cast, but he can get a few useful buffs out of these levels.<br>-Divine Might and Divine Shield.  He can add his charisma bonus to his damage and AC, he should be able to get them to last 10-12 rounds depending on equipment.<br>-Good Taunt total.  He has a 49 taunt, this isn't going to guarrantee a taunt against an opponent with a maxed concentration, but it should still be useful. <br>-Ability to use mage scrolls and wands.  Most scrolls and wands are useable by bards.<br>-Good Saves.  He should be able to make his saves against spells.<br>-Imune to fear, sleep, disease, paralysis and fire.  Immunities are always nice.<br>-Knockdown.  Improved Knockdown would be better, but this is useful against casters and enemies who can only be hit on a 20. <br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br><br>-Mediocre Hitpoints.  488 is okay, and with a potion of endurance he can manage over 500.<br>-Alignment change along Law-Chaos axis.  It is a Law to Chaos change which isn't that bad, but it is hard, if not impossible in some settings, to manage this change.<br><br><b>Knight of Bahamut</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Human<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Lawful Good<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 14<br>DEX 8<br>CON 14 <br>INT 14<br>WIS 14<br>CHA 14<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>Level 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 Attribute Bonuses go to Strength<br>Level 36 and 40 Attribute Bonuses go to Charisma<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Bard 4<br>Paladin 26<br>Red Dragon Disciple 10<br><br><i>Level Distribution and Feats</i><br>Level 1: (Paladin 1): Weapon Focus (Scimitar), Knockdown<br>Level 2: (Paladin 2) <br>Level 3: (Paladin 3): Power Attack<br>Level 4: (Paladin 4) <br>Level 5: (Paladin 5)<br>Level 6: (Paladin 6): Divine Might<br>Level 7: (Paladin 7)<br>Level 8: (Paladin 8 ) <br>Level 9: (Paladin 9): Divine Shield<br>Level 10: (Paladin 10)<br>Level 11: (Paladin 11)<br>Level 12: (Paladin 12): Improved Critical (Scimitar)<br>Level 13: (Paladin 13)<br>Level 14: (Paladin 14)<br>Level 15: (Paladin 15): Extend Spell<br>Level 16: (Paladin 16)<br>Level 17: (Paladin 17)<br>Level 18: (Paladin 18): Blind-Fight<br>Level 19: (Paladin 19)<br>Level 20: (Paladin 20)<br>Level 21: (Paladin 21): Epic Weapon Focus (Scimitar)<br>Level 22: (Paladin 22)<br>Level 23: (Paladin 23): Epic Prowess<br>Level 24: (Paladin 24): Great Strength I<br>Level 25: (Paladin 25)<br>Level 26: (Paladin 26): Armor Skin  (Alignment shift from LG to NG)<br>Level 27: (Bard 1): Great Strength II<br>Level 28: (Red Dragon Disciple 1) <br>Level 28: (Red Dragon Disciple 2)<br>Level 28: (Red Dragon Disciple 3): Great Charisma I<br>Level 31: (Bard 2)<br>Level 32: (Red Dragon Disciple 4)<br>Level 33: (Red Dragon Disciple 5): Great Charisma II<br>Level 34: (Red Dragon Disciple 6)<br>Level 35: (Bard 3)<br>Level 36: (Red Dragon Disciple 7): Great Charisma III<br>Level 37: (Red Dragon Disciple 8 ) <br>Level 38: (Red Dragon Disciple 9)<br>Level 39: (Red Dragon Disciple 10): Great Charisma IV<br>Level 40: (Bard 4)<br><br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 32<br>DEX 8<br>CON 16<br>INT 16<br>WIS 14<br>CHA 22<br><br><i>AB and Damage</i><br>(no buffs, normal scimitar)<br>45/40/35/30 11+1D6 (15-20 x2)<br><br>(+4 to STR and +8 to CHA [Eagles's Splendor, Bull's Strength, Aura of Glory], divine might, bless, aid, prayer, divine favor, deafening clang, bless weapon, holy sword)<br>60/55/50/45 19+1D6 +3 sonic +5 magic +10 divine (+2D6 divine Vs.

Amazing build. With AB, AC, and saves that high, you'll have no trouble (your HP isn't bad either...). Don't be afraid of acid sheath - a holy avenger should dispel it for you. Overall, very good ... I'm going to need to play this. Most verily.<br>_________________<br>CATS!

Nice build. I think the reason you don't see many posted is due to the alignment shift. I know I have 2 or 3 in my stable (as I love the thought of a Bard/Pally mix), but I've never posted a build that requires a shift in alignment. Hmmm, perhaps I should revisit that policy, as it may serve to get the creative juices flowing again...<br>_________________<br>Where I'm playing now: <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk.</a>

A single alignment shift on one axis isn't too bad IMO.  I've posted a couple builds that use it.  Unfortunately it's a lot easier to shift good-evil than law/chaos, or I bet paladin/bard combos would get pretty popular even without RDD thrown in - so few classes can make much use of charisma after all.  And paladins can make very good use of it.<br><br>Solid build all around, I'm always happy to see characters who can use the divine feats well, but not depend too much on them.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
