From the darkness, you hear his voice: "Do not be afraid, mortal"  Yet you are afraid.  You are terrified, yet you know not what of.  As he draws closer, you can see streaks of red around the corners of his mouth.  "You have done well to come this far"  Although you would normally take pride in such a compliment, you now wish you had never ventured into this god-forsaken crypt.  Dreams of wealth lured you here, wealth and power.  Indeed, you have already seen great wonders in this vast necropolis beneath your city, and in this last chamber, items that would worth a small fortune to many a surface-dweller litter the floor.  Yet, you now wish you had never come here.  You wish you were somewhere else, anywhere else.  Even back in that dank hovel you call a home; even that would be better than being here.  You turn to run, but too late; he is upon you...  <br><br><br>Elder Vampire<br><br>Wiz 11/PM 16/BG 13<br>(pre-epic Wiz 4/PM 8/BG <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"> <br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting <br><br>Str 15<br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 16<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 14<br><br>2 points into Int, 8 points into Str<br><br>Ending<br><br>Str 26 <br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Int 19<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 14<br><br>Feats<br><br>1 Power Attack, Cleave<br>3 Still Spell<br>6 Spell Pen.  <br>9 Greater Spell Pen.<br>12 Great Cleave<br>15 WF: Scimitar<br>18 Imp.

I'm not sure what you did, but I don't think its your mistake!<br><br>In my day I have built many PM's, and up until now, we have been allowed to do it with only 3 character levels, ie. wiz3, bard3 etc would open the pm class.  I just ran a leveler and at wiz 4, the pm wasnt open to me, but it did open at lv 5 (or 3rd lvl spell casting). <br><br>Does anyone know if bioware changed the PM class?  I havent played one recently.<br><br>Hopefully, there is someone with more skill than I who can answer this rather upsetting problem  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">

Just out of curiosity, I understand that having DevCrit can be a very handy feature for a melee-based character, but is it worth it in the end to get it at lvl 40?

Since Dev Crit is basically the same as being able to spam instant death spells ad nauseum, even if you have a pathetic DC and few attacks per round, your opponent is eventually going to roll a 1 and fail the save. The only concern you might have is an extremely low AB. In that case, if your opponent's AC is 21+ higher than your AB, you can't land a crit. Otherwise, you win, hands down.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
