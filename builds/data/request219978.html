Are you serious?  A lv 10 capped server?  Lets see, you get 4 feats as sorc and 6 feats as wiz.  BOth same hps. Wiz gets spell lvls faster.  Id go wiz.  That would at least get you some metafeats.  Take spell penet/gr   foci in extend spell.  <br><br>My real suggestion: move to another server!  Who the heck can have fun with such a limited option (at least over an extended period of time.  Id last bout 2 hours!).<br><br>Good luck.

Sorry its not a capped server but xp is very low so it takes a while to gte even to lvl 10 thats why i thought of the lvl 10. <br> I was just curious as to a build that may work like palemaster etc as im not sure of spellcasters i was just looking for some info into making a character that could stay alive but still have some offensive/defensive abilities.

Palemaster isnt a class to look at for offensive abilities  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   They dont get much castin abilities NOR melee abilities...  <br><br>The "best" option you have IF you are going to stay at a low level, as a caster, is to stick with one class.  multiclasses really only work if you are going to go to 20 and beyond.   For off/def look to the cleric!   <br><br>What I suggest though is to get into the pw!  If you enjoy the world play it!  Find a class you enjoy and look up builds here to find a pattern you like.  Enjoy.<br><br>Peace
