First, let me start by saying that this build (although completely different) was inspired by Grizz's "Shock and Awe" <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "253541", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>  There has definitely been a dry spell on genuine "Monsters" posted lately.<br><br>In answer to that, I have combed through and refined several older builds that I will post in the upcoming week that really couldn't be described as anything other than "Melee Monsters"  The first "Fury Ignited" is detailed here.  There were several builds with this combination of classes and even 3 with the same class split.<br><br>Bad213boy's "Draconic Warlord" <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "220374", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Bad213boy's "Smash Mouth"  <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "220654", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>vozhd's "Lord An - Dragon Nettle"  <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "220206", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>All of these builds focus on maximizing strength &amp; AB, while mine takes a more balanced approach building on HP's and garnering all 3 EDR feats.  The result is a much more dangerous foe.  In the end, I only sacrificed one or two points of AB (47 versus 48 or 49 depending upon build) to get significantly higher HP's and 9/- Damage Reduction.<br><br>That coupled with his bard song, UMD and ability to self buff (at least for limited durations) really do make a "Monster".<br><br>Presented for your critique<br><br>Fury Ignited<br><br>Bard(8), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Weapon Master(22), Human<br><br>Alignment:  Any non lawful<br><br>Playable 1-40 PvM<br><br>STR: 14 (34)<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 16 (22)<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14 (16)<br>CHA: 11 (13)<br><br><br>Level 01: Bard(1): Dodge, Mobility<br>Level 02: Bard(2)<br>Level 03: Bard(3): Expertise<br>Level 04: Bard(4): STR+1, (STR=15)<br>Level 05: Bard(5)<br>Level 06: Bard(6): Weapon Proficiency Martial<br>Level 07: Bard(7)<br>Level 08: Red Dragon Disciple(1): CON+1, (CON=17)<br>Level 09: Red Dragon Disciple(2): Spring Attack, (STR=17)<br>Level 10: Red Dragon Disciple(3)<br>Level 11: Red Dragon Disciple(4): (STR=19)<br>Level 12: Red Dragon Disciple(5): CON+1, Whirlwind Attack, (CON=18)<br>Level 13: Red Dragon Disciple(6)<br>Level 14: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=20)<br>Level 15: Red Dragon Disciple(8): Weapon Focus<br>Level 16: Weapon Master(1): STR+1, Weapon of Choice, (STR=20)<br>Level 17: Weapon Master(2)<br>Level 18: Weapon Master(3): Armor Proficiency Heavy<br>Level 19: Weapon Master(4)<br>Level 20: Weapon Master(5): STR+1, (STR=21)<br>Level 21: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Epic Weapon Focus, (INT=16)<br>Level 22: Red Dragon Disciple(10): (STR=25), (CHA=13)<br>Level 23: Weapon Master(6)<br>Level 24: Weapon Master(7): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR=27)<br>Level 25: Weapon Master(8)<br>Level 26: Weapon Master(9)<br>Level 27: Weapon Master(10): Great Strength II, (STR=28)<br>Level 28: Weapon Master(11): STR+1, (STR=29)<br>Level 29: Weapon Master(12)<br>Level 30: Weapon Master(13): Great Constitution I, Epic Prowess, (CON=21)<br>Level 31: Weapon Master(14)<br>Level 32: Weapon Master(15): STR+1, (STR=30)<br>Level 33: Weapon Master(16): Great Strength III, Epic Damage Reduction I, (STR=31)<br>Level 34: Weapon Master(17)<br>Level 35: Weapon Master(18)<br>Level 36: Weapon Master(19): STR+1, Great Strength IV, Epic Damage Reduction II, (STR=33)<br>Level 37: Weapon Master(20)<br>Level 38: Weapon Master(21)<br>Level 39: Weapon Master(22): Great Constitution II, Epic Damage Reduction III, (CON=22)<br>Level 40: Bard(8): STR+1, (STR=34)<br><br>Hitpoints: 592<br><br>Skillpoints: 256<br><br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 25/21/22 (+9 versus spells)<br><br>BAB: 26<br><br>AB (max, naked): 47 (melee), 28 (ranged)<br>Buffed AB = 47 + 2(Bull's) + 2(Bardsong) +1(Magic Weapon) = 52<br>Damage = 1d12 + 14(Buffed Strength) + 1(Magic Weapon) = (16-27)*1.5 = 24-40 per hit. <br><br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 23/34<br>Buffed AC = 10(Base) + 4(RDD) + 8(Tumble) + 8(full Plate) +1(Dex) + 4(Haste) +3(Mage Armor) = 38<br>Add 3 for Tower Shield if you go Sword &amp; Board<br><br>Spell Casting: Bard(3)<br><br>Discipline 43(55), Intimidate 4(5), Listen 24(23), Lore 8(19), Perform 14(15), Spellcraft 42(45), Taunt 43(44), Tumble 40(41), UMD 34(35)<br><br>For all his prowess, he still has his achilles heel.

I would definitely drop either EP or the great con feat for Blind Fight.  In a PvP setting, I'd drop both for BF and KD.  HP and AB are very important, but there are some feats you just can't live without.<br><br>*edit* Revise that to "a PvP setting without KD immunity on items."<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Nimueh_Leafbow on 09/25/06 19:35</span></i></p>

Nice job, in my relatively inexperienced opinion regarding character building. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  I've been thinking of making a melee build using RDD because of the nice stat boosts. All I've used RDD for so far is my archer with Devastating Critical. It's probably not the greatest, since the only special thing about it is a 1 in 10 Dev Crit (19-20) and maybe the fact that it could do reasonably well in melee due to STR, but it loses Arcane Archer AB. Other than that it has no Uncanny Dodge or Epic Dodge. I've also never been able to make a WM build I was happy with without Fighter, but then I haven't really tried too many times. <br><br>But enought about my builds. This build is pretty feat starved considering all those WM feats and no Fighter levels. It doesn't help that you need to spend feats on weapon and armor proficiencies. You could go Elf and get longsword or rapier for free. Looks like you have it with Greataxe though. If that is the case, you can't go sword and board. Going Elf you would lose a feat, defeating the purpose, and get a CON penalty, and lose some skillpoints. Bad idea. The way you have it this seems like a character I wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley, or a lit one for that matter. As a side note, your alignment wouldn't be "any," it must be non-lawful.

I have some suggestions to this build.<br><br>Since this is a no dev crit build I would take weapon prof exotic an focus in scythe. Take improved critical instead of armor prof heavy, and raise 1 dex. Take blind fight, Toughness and armor skin. Trade this for 2 basic AB and DAM.<br><br>End up 30 str, 14 dex, 22 con, +40HP<br><br>45 AB, 2d4+10 (16-20 x5) with keen edge, which you can cast 3 times a day. This will generate hefty amount of damage over time, as long as opponent is not dev.crit immune.<br>AC 31 with mundane chainmail<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By blixen71 on 09/27/06 13:46</span></i></p>
