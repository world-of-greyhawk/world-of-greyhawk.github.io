Hey everyone. It's been a long time since I've played NwN, and an even longer time since I've posted here, but I'm getting the game again in a  couple of weeks and wanted to plan out my new build. I've always been a fan of dodging, but what I had in mind was recreating a prestige called Dread Fang. Dread Fangs are elite drow warriors that combine fighter and rogue classes. <br><br>So what I had in mind was combining barbarian with shadowdancer. I only want to invest in Shadowdancer long enough to get epic dodge, so this will end up being more of a duelist type build. What I wanted to know, is how I can best utilize the barbarian part of the build. Any suggestions?

Alright, let's go with your demands, you need 10 levels of Shadowdancer and 25 DEX for Epic Dodge, though I'd take Rogue instead of Shadowdancer myself.<br><br>You should take a third class to get more stuff in your build... if you want a lot of Barbarian levels you can get good boost with only a few levels of Monk or Fighter.<br><br>What environment you're planning on playing your build? if you're on low magic then you should take caster levels like Wizard or Cleric for buffs.<br><br>Barbarian itself gives you rages, so you know you can buff STR and CON to good amounts even being DEX based, but as DEX based I think you're only getting up to Terrifying Rage, which you can get with 15 Barbarian levels, since you probably won't qualify for Thundering Rage nor Mighty Rage. Barbarian levels give low amount of DR and a bit of HP but going too much as of Barbarian 30 / Shadowdancer 10 is a waste, you better get a third class...<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Ok, thanks for the tip. But why would you take Rogue instead of Shadowdancer? I particularly like the Hide in Plain Side feat, because I plan on doing alot of running when I get back to NwN. ^^ You know how it is, when you start mini wars, they never go the way you expect them to. Always best to be able to sound the retreat. of course many of the legit people have true seeing, anyway, so it's not like that'll help me any.<br>_________________<br>You can't kill what was simply never there. . .

Well, perhaps because escaping isn't my thing... Hide in Plain Sight is awesome, but I don't find any use to it if I don't have sneak attack (means, a reason to attack from the shadows), but well, if you want to escape then it's your choice; 13 levels of Rogue can get the pre-requisites of Epic Dodge, the difference is that you need to spend in Dodge and Mobility to become Shadowdancer (kind of useless feats), instead as a Rogue you'd get some sneak attack which is always nice without feat pre-requiistes to take the class.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Hmm I like the concept, C.D. has a rogue/sd/barb in the search engine you could use it as a "template" for ideas<br>His is rogue heavy but get's Epic Dodge and SC V. Which a crafty drow might have (besides HiPs).<br><br><br>If you don't have the search engine it's in my sig.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank"><b>NWNWiki</b></a><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank"><b>NWNCharacterBuildSearchEngine</b></a><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/" target="_blank"><b>TheNWNVault</b></a>
