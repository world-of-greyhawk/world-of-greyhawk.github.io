This isn't a question of most powerful build or anything like that.  Rather, when you are playing alone, what type of character do you find yourself playing most often?<br><br>Personally, I tend to play strength based fighter/rogues with a chaotic alignment (I tend to play CG or CN, but I also play CE).<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

I'm with you Mith (hey, a rhyme!). I tend to go with STR-based FTR/Rogue builds. Second slot would go to FTR/Bard/RDD. Usually CN or TN.<br><br>I'll switch it up sometimes, of course and play something totally different, but the first thing that pops into my head on a new server or in a new single-player module is usually a FTR/Rogue. They're just too damned versatile!<br><br>*edit* Currently running a variant of my Pointy-eared Rogue build through the Cult of the Reptile God module. Good fun, and she's doing great.

my first thought goes towards a ranger, either with rogue or barb levels for UD.  sometimes monk or cleric if i am in the mood.<br><br>another favourite is cleric/rogue with fighter or cot.<br><br>i used to play lawful, but i tend more towards chaotic now.

Clerics...<br><br>I have tried to play many builds, but alas, whenever i start a new server its always a cleric of some kind.

All time favorite has to be pure monk. You will never be the best fighter. You won't be the best rogue.

I have many favourite builds and most of them imply 25+ Cleric levels. My personal favourite is Jormundgandr, otherwise I really love Cleric 26/Bard 4/RDD 10 both WIS and STR based. My recently posted Cleric 38/FTR 1/Bard 1 is quite enjoyable too, especially if you manage to find a server with a Finnish pantheon (it's supposed to be a cleric of the finnish god of Death Tuoni).

Bards are another class I'm fond of, usually ranging from 16 to 26 lvls (apart the 1 to 4 lvls for skill dumps and/or access to PM or RDD). Bard/RDD/PM is quite a blast to play.<br><br>I'm not the mage type in NWN, but I pick the Exalted Sorceress when I want to play one.<br><br>Too many good builds to choose from, that's a curse! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?

I prefer melee combatants with some versatility - particularly spellcasting abilities or the rogue skill set.  Warrior rogues and battle clerics are very nice.  Monks are also a favorite, but I've played so many monks I've been focusing on other builds for variety.  <br><br>Warrior bards are my current focus of attention - a solid combination of skills and spells both.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

My favorite is a Chaotic good ranger with double short swords. Sometimes I also like an LE Fighter/WM/BG with great scythe, which looks like "death" itself.

In single play mods, I've always gravitated toward "good" characters. Archer/rangers or druids.<br> But when I started playing NWN PWs, I've had the most fun playing evil or "thuggish" characters.If you've got some evil friendly DMs, you can take part in some very interesting plots.<br> Oh and even though they're kind of gimpy, I love half-orcs and hate hate hate elves.In NWN the models are just plain fugly!But I digress.. <br> My all time fave of this sort was a half-orc barb/rogue/BG. Played this character for several years till I retired him.

Fun topic, Mith.<br><br>For wanderingn around bopping things, I like monks.  They're just fun.<br><br>For a strong RP environment, no one is as much fun to play as a bard--someone annoys you, make up an insulting song about him; and I lean toward chaotic-good.<br><br>Occasionally, I enjoy coming up with a really nasty, cruel evil rogue/blackguard, and then playing him as a cheerful, friendly, nice guy until he's ready to stab you in the back.
