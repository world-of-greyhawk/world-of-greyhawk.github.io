<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>The Ugly Fastfingers Gold Edition – by cakerj<br><br>This is the second version of the Ugly Fastfingers, made from suggestions of other players.

Ive been thinking on some small changes to this building:<br><br>- picking 2 point from STR and putting it on CON<br>- removing Blind Fight and Toughness for Improved Critical(unarmed) and (kama)<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>NOTE: When I tested the equipped stats and forgot to use a monk magical glove, so, probably, the AB can get higher.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By cakerj on 05/07/05 19:24</span></i></p>

How are you casting spells when you dont have any caster class in the build.  you have rogue for using scrolls with UMD, but you have no spells.  <br>So when you say you are buffed, in what way do you mean?<br><br>Scrolls perhaps?<br><br>btw.. this monk is so fast when he runs there is no way you can control him in tight spaces without running into walls or past doorways.  <br><br>My computer couldnt keep up with the character he moves so fast...lol.

The ONLY pro???? You must be kidding.<br><br>I dont think its a waste because some servers have the great swordsman belt (and the other two) - that give a good damage reduction for one type of damage. On this servers, these belts are useless, since you can switch the type of damage as fast as you want by the use of quickslots.<br><br>It is just worthless on servers that have items that give protection to all types of damage.

Honestly...I'm not sure I see the point of a dex focused build that doesn't have very good crit ranges, doesn't have sneak damage, doesn't have extremely high AB, and doesn't get epic dodge or self concealment.  I mean, you have very high AC with "standard NWN items", but a fighter type, especially weapon master, would probably have high enough AB to hit you with the same level of items, and a caster would make mincemeat of you without you really being able to do much.  It just seems like it wouldn't be that effective in the end.  Hrm...I think when I get home from work I'll level it up and see how it plays out, and then try the old Prismatic Dragon test.<br><br>Steve

But your build does not have a particularly high AB.  A high AB can somewhat make up for low damage, as you hit for less damage, but very often.

That doesn't mean it's necessarily a good idea for this build, but Improved Invisibility from a scroll doesn't make Self Concealment useless.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;So, you will have 50% concealment, plus 70+ AC, plus possible magical deffenses (from scrolls). It wont be that easy as you say for him to be hit. And there are some spells that give whoever hits you damage (at least 3 spells like that), so it wont be that easy for mellee attackers.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>First of all, you really shouldn't be assuming using basically every scroll in the game cast on yourself in order to have your character survive.  If that's the case, then that's a sign that your character isn't strong enough as it is, especially since a few Mordenkainen Disjunctions from scrolls leave you completely unbuffed.  Secondly, just as you can buff your AC and have high powered equipment, your enemies can buff themselves and have high powered equipment to negate that (another reason not to take into account every spell in the game.  A fighter can absolutely get ABs into the 60s (An arcane archer can get there naked with a mundane bow, and push up to 70 with items).  And a ring of elemental resistance would take care of most of those damage shields when cast from a scroll (they just really aren't that useful without the mage levels to back it up).<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Against mages, youve already have a good SR (from 33 lvls of monk). As I remember, you could also use Silence on yourself and get (very fast) close to the caster. Just a few mages can cast silenced spells.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>The SR of a 33 level monk is not really effective against a mage.  Your SR would be 43, and a pure mage with spell penetration feats would have a spell penetration check of 1d20+46, meaning you wouldn't resist any spells (well, except for auto-failure on a 1, if that happens with spell penetration).  You'd have to drop the mage levels quite a bit before that would really become an issue.  And an intelligent mage would have a few scrolls available to counteract that silencing trick (it's pretty well known).<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Ive made a question but I guess nobody answered to it: should I change Blind Fight and Toughness for Improved critical for kama and unarmed?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Hrm...I'm not sure...kamas and unarmed really don't have great crit ranges...I'll leave that for someone else.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Another one that stravinsky brought to my attention: should I make a few changes and pick Epic dodge?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Just to let you know, you'd need to take a minimum of 10 levels of rogue to qualify for Epic dodge, since you'd need to pick up Defensive Roll.  Alternatively, you can drop rogue for shadowdancer and take 5 levels of that, but then you'd lose UMD.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 05/13/05 07:19</span></i></p>

Actualy (I forgot to mention), the build has Empty Body. It gives 50% concealment (twice a day), but I dont know for how long. And I guess it cant be dispeled, at least, it shouldnt.

It was just about Improved Invisibility vs. Self Concealment.  If you have enough monk levels, Empty Body works well enough to make Self Concealment V much less useful.<br><br>Steve
