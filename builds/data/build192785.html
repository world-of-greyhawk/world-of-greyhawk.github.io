<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 .. PvM Build</b><br><br>Ok, my turn!<br><br>I was at work today, and i had a thought about how to tweak a character i was building on a server.  The idea was to take elf as race to get longsword/longbow without having to take martial feat or fightr-type level.  <br><br>I designed this guy for general use.  I took no spell focus feats cuz, well, clerics have some nice spells, but i never really worry bout that sort of thing <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     Obviously, this is for playin through a mod/server, not playin others.. but  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>The character can very easily be played through from lv 1.  I find clerics some of the easiest characters to play after lv 3!  If you take the right feats.   The one thing i find with clerics, and i feel this to be important in how you play this build, they MUST buff themselves (and others if they have spell space), they must mix it up physically, and they can have some truly amazing save spells and damage spells.   The jakc of all trades scenario.  I play a cleric in that order.. buff, melee, and support magic.  You can get away with being the major damage caster, but its not my style of play (thats what sorcs and wizs are for <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    )<br><br>align : (what you prefer) Lawful good<br>Str 14  Dex 10  Con 12  I 10  Ch 14  Wis 16<br><br>1   cleric1    power attack   [Good / Travel ]<br>2   C2     <br>3   c3         wpn foc: longsword<br>4   c4                             W 17<br>5   c5<br>6   c6         cleave<br>7   c7<br>8   c8                             W 18<br>9   c9         Zen archry<br>10  c10<br>11  c11<br>12  c12        Extend spell        W 19<br>13  c13<br>14  c14<br>15  c15        improve crit: longsword<br>16  c16                            W 20<br>17  c17<br>18  c18        Max spell<br>19  c19<br>20  c20                            W 21<br>21  c21        Epic wpn foc<br>22 Cot1<br>23 Cot2        Great wisdom (GW) 1 W 22<br>24 Cot3        Epic Prowess        W 23<br>25 Cot4        GW 2                W 24<br>26 Cot5<br>27 Cot6        GW 3 / GW 4         W 26<br>28 Cot7                            W 27<br>29 Cot8        GW 5                W 28<br>30 Cot9        GW 6                W 29<br>31 Cot10       GW 7                W 30<br>32  c22                            W 31<br>33  c23*       GW 8 / armor skin   W 32<br>34  c24<br>35  c25<br>36  c26*       GW 9 / GW 10        W 35<br>37  c27 <br>38  c28<br>39  c29*       combat cast/imp comb cast<br>40  c30                            W 36<br><br>concentration 43<br>Spellcraft    43<br><br>fort 27  ref 21  will 40<br><br>AB  28/23/18 unarmd<br>    31/26/21 longsword<br>    38/33/28 longbow (yes, i found that interesting too!)<br><br>Yes, there are lots of ways to tweak the build.  The MOST incredible thing is the longbow ab.  I took 10 great wisdom to fit the character name, but when I play this character through i will only take gw to 8 and take wpn foc: longbow  epic focus : longbow, and prob drop imp combat casting for point blank shot.  To do this, i would take these feats in the early 20s, leaving the GWs to the end of the build.  Your wisdom will be high anyway so you wont notice the difference.  I dont suggest subbing out a third GW though, cuz you'd leave the wisdom at a mere 33 (odd number), it just wouldnt be "epic"  lol, your choice.  Oh, and if you wanted to, you could take an epic spell or 2.  Im not sure why! having some nice MAXD damage spells at your disposal, again, your choice.  Oh, and i know many of you will say, 4 atts/rd!!  High ab!  And in some respects i agree.  It is SOO tempting to take a few Cot lvls pre epic, to make it up to this.  Im not sure if it would take 4 or 6 cot lvls, but what it would do is lower the wisdom down to a mere 32 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">      Im not sure how this guy could survive with only that much wisdom, but  your choice (can you feel the sarcasm).<br><br>All of these ideas and the many more that you can think of, are great, but the whole idea of the build was to make a stinkinly high wisdom based cleric that was able to most anything.  I think 20 to a stat is pretty decent.  <br><br>How would I play this character through?<br><br>Use the melee spells!  The lv 1 spell is one of the best spells for damage, with the exception of d might, and this guy gets close to 20 of them per rest!<br><br>If you dont have items that make up +12 stats, take maxd stat buffs.  Use great magic wpn + darkfire if you cant find a decent longsword.  Magic vestment *2 (armor + shield) + faith spell will get AC to a fair lvl.  I took Good for stoneskin, and Travel for Haste, you can choose what you like.  With 30 cleric lvls and extend haste, you can be hasted for hours!  LOL   jk<br><br>Oh, the last thing i have to say is about alignment.  Many people would say an elf could never be lawful good, but this is the WISE elf priest!  I feel lawful good is the only WISE alignment, for clerics, that dont have to be an alignment... if that makes sense!<br><br>One last thing: because this is a straight up cleric/cot build (i ckd before i posted), but i apologize if anyone else feels this is too similar to their build.  I assure you, i did not steal it.  I have been playing clerics for so long, that they sorta mix in my head.  I just thought i had to post this cuz i had never seen or thought of it before today (in this manner)<br><br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>PEACE<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 05/02/05 17:03</span></i></p>

Nice build:)  I myslef have a cleric/cot.  I took 4 lvls of cot pre-epic to get the 26 base ab and 4 attacks a round. You could even go 10 cleric/10 cot pre-epic as well. for 27 base ab. Actually going from 32 to 30 wis. won't make much differnce, esp. with the benifit of ab and one more attack.   Personally if this ere a PvM character I'd drop wis. completely, down to 20 and pump str or dex which-ever one is going to be used for ab, thus making this a very good generalist. The huge wisdom boost on your build is very good for a big damage flinging build, but if damage is your last requirement then I think you would get a better return on your feats from strengthing your character with them via ab or ac or some special abiltiy.  <br><br>I do like you build:), just pointing out some other options:)<br><br>Oh, I forgot aslo maybe dropping 2 of those cot feats for  a class that has tumble in it would be very nice. and if its the loss of feats that you'er worried about take harper scout to replace the lost feats of the cot:)<br><br>Jim,(Fist.)

Thanks.  I know the huge wisdom for this build is alittle much, but i wanted to see how many spells it would give, which is something i forgot to include.  Never post a build at 2am!<br><br>I ended up with the followin spell slots spell lv (# spells)<br>1(10) 2(9) 3(9) 4(9) 5(9) 6(7) 7(7) 8(7) 9(7)<br><br>I wish i knew more about spell DC and stuff like that, but if you could add +12 to wis from itms, im guessin you could throw spells all day long and never run out.  Except if you cast extended haste.. then you would run out in bout 20 mins!  LOL  jk

It's simply equal to 10 + the spell's level + the appropriate stat modifier (wisdom in this case).  So, this build unbuffed would have a DC on...let's say Storm of Vengeance of 10 + 9 (9th level spell) + 13 (Wisdom modifier) = 32.  With +12 to WIS, it would be 38.  Considering that's without spell focuses, it's quite good (which is to be expected when you pump wisdom that high).<br><br>Steve

Charisma is pretty useless in this build, I would reduce it to 10 and put the points into Dex to get rapid shot or Int for some extra skills.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Giantevilhead on 04/29/05 23:44</span></i></p>

Divine Might and eagle's splendor could make charisma a very nice addition to this build, adding an often irrisistable divine typed damage. Also, with no CHA bonus the CoT class feature of Divine Wrath is unusable.

Thanks again.  I was thinking bout the charisma.. I LOVE divine might!  but the +2 from what i have isnt really worth the feat.. and the way i see it, if you are gonna use div might you also need extra turns, and that is now down to a measely 32 wisdom <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">    I also like to have cha for the turning (why take a cleric to lv 30 and not be able to turn a baby skel.. unless you is a dwarf).  I know you dont get many, but those you do get.. WOW!   lol<br><br>Like i said, there are many ways to alter the build.  I did this one as an extreme case, really to see what would happen if i could pump wisdom.  Infact, i was looking at doing the build (i know wisdom clerics are good, i havent lvld this one past 24.. but up to 20 he is fun as heck to play and tuff), i was lookin at doin the great wisdom 8 with wf/ewf in longbow, to take advantage of the zen archery feat.  but i still havent decided yet.<br><br>Peace

I know its been a few days, but i took alook at a druid cot build in the same manner (someone askd bout playin a druid caster, so i tried one out in this manner.. not as good though!).  I took elf as race for longbow!  Turns out you need melee wpn for cot, so i had 2 feats for wpn foc, not the worst thing.  But druids didnt (at least as far as i know, having nver played a druid seriously) require charisma, so i left mine at 8!  I was able to get wisdom to 18 at start, with the rest of the stats identical.  The high wisdom for druid didnt do much, spell slot wise, but for a cleric, it may be an alternative. You would end with a paltry wisdom of 38 base, with +12 from items bringin in the elusive 50 wisdom.   The druid build does give you a Dragon shape and some nice shifts, which may be fun to mess around with.  But alas.. i am not a nature lover <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_sleep2.gif">   so ill stick with the cleric build.<br><br>WHOM in their right minds would ever do this?  Not sure.  What is the difference between 34/36/38 base wisdom?  not much.  So either way, it is your choice.  Personal reflection and preference, id go the wis 34 route! takin gr wis 8 with longbow foc and such.<br><br>Just wanted to add this for the history books.<br><br>Peace<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avado on 04/30/05 23:49</span></i></p>

Bout to try this build, but I would take one lvl in monk at the end. Just for the AC bonus. *shrug* Awesome build nevertheless tho!:D
