<b>Playable 1-40 in PvM.</b>  Gains power, relatively speaking, in low-magic or "balanced item" worlds where arcane buffs won't be eclipsed by things like heavy DR and haste items.<br><br>As a challenge, and to maybe help combat my dislike of the character type, I've decided to try making an arcane spellsword that isn't crippled both as a caster and as a warrior.

How is this different?</b><br>A:  My build is very different in the details - levelling path, final level distribution, feat choices, etc.  The builds I credit were helpful in giving me ideas of how to build a "fighter-mage" and providing me with a couple tricks that made this build somewhat better (such as being able to take Epic Weapon Specialization as a COT from Stravinsky00's build).<br><br><b>Q:  But in the end, isn't the build substandard as a fighter and as a caster?</b><br>A:  In some respects yes, in some respects no.<br><br>+39 AB unbuffed is very workable for this build, as you have access to buff magic that will bump it up to the mid-40s without having to rely on true strike.  True strike can be used to land a nearly guaranteed knockdown, for example, or to land hits while in improved expertise mode.<br><br>The build's base AC leaves something to be desired, which is why I took improved expertise and is part of why I took ICC.  If you need to go into casting mode you can activate expertise and parry and then get your spells off while you're heavily protected.  <br><br>As your mage levels develop, which is admittedly late in the build, premonition will be an excellent defense against many 'minion' style creatures, and epic warding is great protection against anything.<br><br>Your hitpoints are very low for an epic fighter, however, and unfortunately there's little way around that.  Extended Endurance will be very helpful to you, and keeping extended defensive buffs ready is a must.<br><br><b>Q:  But what about the offensive casting?  You only have 22 caster levels and low save DCs!  And you are a wizard with a relatively low intelligence.  That's not going to give you many spells per day compared to a sorcerer!</b><br>A:  That's all very true.  Against serious boss-style enemies you'll need to focus on using buffs, a few no-save attack spells, and your melee ability.  With Disjunction you can lower 32 SR to 22 SR in an area around your target and reliably penetrate it, but saves will be a problem regardless.<br><br>The choice of wizard over sorcerer is actually something that benefits this build because you can learn every spell available, allowing you to change your configuration for taking down minions with area spells and summons, then change track to fight bosses using buffs and bigby's.  A sorcerer would be stuck without the situationaly configurability that a spellsword type build needs more than a pure arcane caster does.<br><br>Illusion specialist is a very practical choice for powergaming and getting an extra spell per day without giving up any truly powerful spells other than mass haste.  Mass haste is a great spell, and some of the other spells you're giving up are at least moderately useful (protection from spells, mind fog) and work well in a party, but that's balanced against an extra spell per day at each spell level in a build that's very starved for them.  The benefits outweigh the costs.<br><br><b>Q:  Did this build change your mind about spellswords at all?</b><br>A:  Yes and no.  It's <i>fun</i> to play this sort of character and blast away with fire and lightning then hack down survivors with the sword.  But while it's certainly a powerful enough character to face most enemies as long as you are able to prepare spells for them, its magical power develops late in the build and the levels between 25 or so and 33 (if not 36) will probably be a rough stretch.<br><br>So basically while it's fun to play, in the end it's not really more effective than a true melee, but is harder to level, has less hitpoints, has to rest much more often, and think ahead for spell preparation.<br><br>It does gain some points for utility and roleplayability, however, since wizard brings along the ability to learn spells like Knock, Find Traps, Continual Light, Legend Lore, etc, and to buff your allies.<br><br>....    .....     ....    ....    ....    ....    ....<br><br><i>griphook ..Edited "Dex" Stat</i><br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 10/26/05 23:06</span></i></p>

"Vas Flam!"  Mikall incanted, causing fire to flow down the length of his sword and fan out in a wide cone to his front, causing the previously confident trolls to flinch and duck away in fear.  The one he had wounded with the blade just before was doomed, however, the fire pouring into its fresh wounds and stopping the beast's regeneration.  It gurgled its deathcry, a grim warning to its comrades that this human was not the easy meal they'd hoped for.<br><br>The trolls hesitated.  They were unused to seeing armored humans use fiery spells, and the prospect of being permanantly killed gave the usually fearless beasts pause.  Mikall, however, didn't hesitate:  pointing his blade and intoning another spell, he sent forth a swarm of firebolts that each sought out a trollish target and ignited it.  As if to underscore their weakness, trolls were remarkably flammable and each one hit by a firebolt was turned into a two-legged pyre.  The few beasts who escaped this barrage fled in terror from the hated fire, leaving their fellows to be consumed in the flames.  Laying about with his sword, the wizard-warrior struck down any beast that came too near in its death throes, blade hastening the monsters' inevitable demises.<br><br>He smiled grimly at the flammability of the creatures, even as his stomach twisted from the smell of burning troll.  The things were nearly immortal due to their amazing regenerative properties, which were so powerful that only fire and acid could truly finish off the foul creatures by cauterizing their wounds, but their bodies caught ablaze so easily it was truly ironic.  Mikall despised the beasts, one of which had eaten his brother, and whenever he came across troll-sign on his travels he used his strong grasp of the arcane to prepare a battery of fiery magics and went out of his way to hunt them down and destroy them.<br><br>Wiping his sword on a rag following the engagement, he took a long drink from his canteen, and then followed after the fleeing survivors, implacable in his determination to finish the job.  Mikall still had nightmares of the troll smiting down and eating Jarrod as he watched, helpless, too young to fight such a monster.  His vow of revenge had seen him train amongst holy warriors and war-wizards, learning the skills to defeat the horrible beasts in combat and the spells to give their deaths the same finality as his brother's.  <br><br>Now in their turn, it was trolls who had nightmares of him.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

nice to hear that you give spellswords a chance, cuz they can really be fun to play.<br>You are also quit right, it IS a CHALLENGE.<br><br>You did some interresting choices there to alterate one of my favorite Builds: The Magical Marauder. (to give "Mithdradates" one`s more credit)<br><br>i like that you improved his greatest disadvantages:<br>low AC and saves by taking longsword/Shield and more CoT lvls.<br><br>But i personally also agree with theshadow0015 by going: F4/W26/CoT10<br>I did this myself and must say it worked great.<br>Wizards and Sorceres get a bonus feat.. every 3 lvls over lvl 20. So you get one at lvl 23 and lvl 26.<br>you spent one for autostill III to free a feat. for Epic Prowess (which is your lost CoT bonus Feat.) and get one for free<br><br>You trade 2 saves for one more Epic Spell like Hellball or Epic Mage Armor to help with bad AC. you also get better chances with SR.<br>_________________<br>Adventure - is the result of poor planning

Nah... I meant those Bonus feats... I treat them all the same (Bioware does... since you can pick up those Epic feats with the meta-magic feats)<br><br>And yeah, like LuckyLion (love that name, btw) said you can get Auto Still 3 and Epic Prowess, the feat you'd lose with it... plus the 4 caster levels (with a Maxed Out Horrid Wilting, yay) it seems more balanced. Yeah, you lose 2 saves but to have Spellcraft bonuses and if you aren't an Illusionist you can take Protection From Spells (+8 vs Spells)... not much of a probably... excpet saving vs. DevCrit... but you can just blast melee builds away with IGMS, H.W.'s but first drive a Ray of Enfeeblement through their chest. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> <br><br>OH... and I like your fic too... nice job.

The thing I don't like about dropping COT down now that I look at it is that the level progress to 20 is 4 fighter 6 wizard 10 COT... this gives us a 17 BAB at 20 for 4 attacks and more or less minimizes the impact of being a spellsword on our BAB.<br><br>Then in epic the 4 COT levels give you the chance to do skill dumps on the way up (though my level order isn't optimized for that, it's not hard to change either), and end with a class that has discipline as a class skill.<br><br>Going ftr 4/wiz 7/cot 9 to 20 will cost us a point of BAB while only taking wizard levels in epic will cost us a maxed discipline.<br><br>I guess it's a matter of taste in the end.  I feel the character needs the BAB and discipline more than he needs more casting power since he's still not going to be as good as a pure caster or a pure melee.<br><br>You can split the difference, to an extent, and take 24 or 25 wizard levels.  Or just accept the loss of BAB.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
