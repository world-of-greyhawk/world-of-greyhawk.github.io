ok i made this build for Antavia ware ther are a hell of rules. <br><br>1. Arcane spellcaster classes ( wiz/sorc/pm ) with less than 5 levels of rogue, bard, or monk and more than 20 points of tumble will receive a modification to tumble to limit their tumble to a maximum of 20.<br><br>2. All other classes with less than 5 levels of rogue or bard and more than 15 points of UMD will receive a modification to UMD to limit UMD to a maximum of 15.<br><br>3. If you have no levels of wizard, sorcerer, palemaster, or bard and have any of the following number of levels in the following classes you will receive a critical hit immunity property:<br><br>Fighter: 31<br>Barbarian: 31<br>Ranger: 31<br>Paladin: 35<br>Monk: 40<br>Blackguard: 22<br>Dwarven Defender: 22<br>Champion of Torm: 22<br>Weapon Master: 22<br><br>Note: 10+ level palemasters will still get the deathless mastery feat.<br><br>4. For post 40 attack bonuses and damage bonuses, the following forumla is used to determine your bonus. A melee class factor is calculated from the sum of your levels, with wizard, sorcerer, palemaster, and red dragon disciplecounting as 0, cleric, druid, shifter, rogue, monk, assassin, and shadowdancer counting as 1, all other classes counting as 2. This sum is then divided by 80, giving a melee factor.<br><br>The standard 1 ab/dmg point per 2 post 40 levels is adjusted by this melee factor, thus pure fighter types gain their post 40 melee bonus quickly, where pure arcane casters gain almost none.<br><br>thise rules are made to balnce the server so that a figter whit disent lvl can tank.. so u dont have to go pale master.. and thare are no imunaty items to any thing.<br>only bunus to saves. so i wantede a char whit good ab and saves.. and then the ac is not bad. was tinking of makeing him str. based.. then i can buf con more.. =D <br>start/end<br>str 14<br>dex 17/34<br>con 10<br>int 10<br>wiz 12/14<br>cha 14<br><br>Lvl 1	Paladin 1	2 	Wep. fines, wep. focus <br>2	Paladin 2		<br>3	Paladin 3	1	Power attack<br>4	Figter 1	1 figter	Wep. spe.<br>5	Paladin 4		<br>6	Paladin 5	1	Divine migth<br>7	Paladin 6		<br>8	Paladin 7		<br>9	Paladin 8	1	Divine sheild<br>10	Paladin 9		<br>11	CoT 1		<br>12	CoT 2	        2 cot	Inproved crit, thufnes <br>13	CoT 3		<br>14	CoT 4	        1 cot	Cleav<br>15	CoT 5	        1	Extended spell ?<br>16	CoT 6	        1 cot	Knock down<br>17	Paladin 10		<br>18	Paladin 11	1	Blind fight<br>19	Paladin 12		<br>20	CoT 7		<br>21	CoT 8	        2cot	Epic dex 1, Epic wis 1<br>22	CoT 9		<br>23	CoT 10	        1 cot	Epic wis 2<br>24	CoT 11	        1	Epic dex 2, <br>25	CoT 12		<br>26	CoT 13		<br>27	CoT 14	        2 cot	Epic Wep Focus, Epic dex 3<br>28	Figter 2	1 figter	epic wep. spe.<br>29	CoT 15		<br>30	CoT 16	        1 	Epic dex 4<br>31	CoT 17		<br>32	CoT 18	        1 cot	Epic prowers<br>33	CoT 19	        1	Epic dex 5<br>34	CoT 20		<br>35	CoT 21		<br>36	CoT 22	        2 cot	Epic dex 6, Armor skin<br>37	Paladin 13		<br>38	Paladin 14		<br>39	Paladin 15	1	Epic dex 7<br>40	Paladin 16		<br><br><br>ac naked 28<br>ac whit +5 gear and 12 to all stats and buffs 65 easy to get no the server <br>whit +7 gear is the max and 12 to all stats  and buffs 73<br><br>ab naked 46 whit wep of chose <br>ab whit +5 gear and 12 to all stats and buffs 65<br><br>saves i dont no coz i have not made it in the game i cant run on my laptop.  but what u think

Why Dex-based?  What does he gain from this instead of going Charisma and Strength-based?  Not only will his damage output be low, but you have no tumble or Epic Dodge or Concealment to go with your Dex AC.<br><br>Also, your starting attributes are 3 points over.  You're going to have to drop dex to 16, or reconfigure.<br><br>And I think you meant Holy Star of Torm, not <i>Thom</i><br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
