Need a good fighter rouge, for a low magic server that is good at trap setting and disabling. Max level is 30, prefer above two classes, but a 3rd class can be added, as long it is not a prestige class. Thanks for help.

I took Avado advice study a bunch fighter rouge combo's and tried them out on the Novice to Epic Chac Builder. The one I found I like the best was Grizzled_Dwarflord's, The last great Bounty Hunter. <br><br>Then using Nwiki as a Ref I modified it to fit the specfics of the server I play on. Since 30 lvl is the max I had to cut 10 levels, so I got rid of the COT and redesigned it some. I hope the Dwarflord does not mind me for using his wonderful chac.<br><br>Please any improvements to make the chac better please let me know. This is the first Chac I ever redesigned or made. I am sure some of the numbers are wrong as I got confused trying to calculate all the variables.<br><br>The Last Great Bounty Hunter<br>Rogue20<br>Fighter10<br><br>Dwarf<br>Any Non-Evil<br>Playable 1-30 PvP, PvM<br><br>Attributes<br>Str16 (22)<br>Int14<br>Wis10<br>Dex14<br>Con18 <br>Chr6<br><br>Leveling Guide<br>1 Rogue1, Blooded<br>2 Fighter1, Weapon Focus: War Hammer<br>3 Fighter2, Blindfighting, Knockdown<br>4 Fighter3, Str17<br>5 Fighter4, Weapon Specialization: Great Axe<br>6 Rogue2, Skill Focus: Move Silently<br>7 Rogue3<br>8 Rogue4, Str18<br>9 Rogue5, Skill Focus: Hide<br>10 Rogue6 <br>11 Rogue7<br>12 Rogue8, Stealthy, Str19<br>13 Rogue9<br>14 Rogue10,  Crippling Strike<br>15 Rogue11, IKD<br>16 Rogue12 Str20<br>17 Rogue13, <br>18 Rouge14, Improved Critical, Skills Mastery<br>19 Rouge15<br>20 Fighter5, Str21<br>21 Fighter6, EWS: War Hammer, EWF: War Hammer<br>22 Fighter7<br>23 Fighter8, Armour skin<br>24 Rogue16  Epic Prowess, (class feat)Improve sneak I<br>25 Rogue17, Con19<br>26 Rogue18,  <br>27 Rogue19  Great Con I, ESF:MS<br>28 Rogue20<br>29 Fighter9, <br>30 Fighter10  ESF: Hide, Epic Toughness I<br><br>Raw Scores<br>AB: 28/23/18/13<br>AC: 27(Full Plate)<br>Hit Points: 318<br>Skill Points: 262<br><br>Stealth in Full plate<br>Hide: 48 (40 in Plate)<br>Move Silently: 48 (40 in Plate)<br>UMD 30 (28) for failure free scroll casting<br><br><br>Saves<br>Fort: 18<br>Will: 17 <br>Reflex: 11<br><br>Skills<br>Hide: 31 (48)<br>Move Silently: 31 (48)<br>Tumble: 30<br>Discipline: 33 (32)<br>UMD: 30 (28)<br>Open Locks: 10 (12)<br>Set Traps: 20 (24) (enough for Deadly)<br>Disable Traps: 16 (20) (enough for Deadly)<br>Search: 20 (22) (enough for Deadly)<br>Spot: 30 (32)<br>Heal: 4<br>Lore: 1 (14)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By sc00ter1821 on 02/11/09 23:56</span></i></p>

No need to drop CoT though. Instead of taking fighter levels 5-10, take CoT instead. You'll end up with the same feats, AB and hp, but your saves will receive a nice bonus.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again
