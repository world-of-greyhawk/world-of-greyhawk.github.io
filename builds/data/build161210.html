with this build it may be advantageous to take a couple of points off dex and shove them onto con, an extra 40 or 80 hp is possibly more useful than one ac and ab, especially when you have high ac and ab anyway

Now that I've read through your build more....<br><br>Nice build. Impressive AB and AC. A couple of thoughts:<br><br>1. If you start as Bard you would get more skill points to spend. Any reason you chose to start as cleric and not bard?<br><br>2. If you put two more points into Intelligence you would have many more skills points to dump into Tumble or Use Magic Device when you take your last bard level at 40. Not that you really need more AC, but if you were going to lose some Dex to bump up Int the Tumble AC would balance the loss of Dex AC. (But not the loss of Dex AB). <br><br>3. Doesn't the Strength Domain provide a 3rd level spell - Divine Power - that gives an extra attack per round? That will help with melee. You could indicate this on your build too.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban.

I know your AB may say 73, but max AB you can get is 66.<br>NWN limits AB bonus to 20, even though you can buff higher than that.<br><br>40 base + 6 from 12 more DEX + 20 ab/enhance/magical bonuses = 66AB<br><br>Still, 66AB isn't bad at all<br><br>Too bad they nerfed divine power.

Its not too hard on my PW - not sure about your own, to gain immune to level 1-2 level spells, that stops belgards iron horn, bull rush, etc.

I like this class combination.  I'm making a cleric 20/bard 4/palemaster 16 myself.  <br><br>I'm curious why you chose 6 con.  I know the build has high ac, but what will you do against elemental damage?  I'm guessing that your few hps will be gone quickly against an enemy mage and you don't have enough cleric levels for the sr spell to work very well.<br><br>Personally, I would take two points from dex and put the saved points into con.

Nice build. Just a couple of things...<br><br>As stated, rather take the rolls that is done when you fight an opponant. The Character sheet does not take things like Max AB bonus into account, and sometimes is 1 or 2 AB off anyways. You will find that your rolls are prolly 66, or even 65. Still not bad, but quite a way away from the 70's you claim.<br><br>Also, I would rather take human, in stead of elf. Granted, the Extra AB is nice, but is it really worth the INCREDIBLE xp penalties that you will get? This character will get XP penalties for almost it's whole life after lvl 10-ish. You will find that it is incredibly difficult to build this char on a persistant world.<br><br>If you take Human, you lose 2 Dex, meaning 1 AB, but you don't get XP penalties, and you also get 8 CON by default, in stead of 6. Much more worth it, if you ask me.<br><br>Otherwise, nice build. Definately worth building.<br><br>Cheers<br>Firestar
