What are your starting stats with this build, joe? And what race are you using? Any particular feats you consider must-haves for it?<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Tsk tsk Bromium, he gets max BAB both ways, it's 19 for both Paladin 17/Rogue 3 and Paladin 16/ Rogue 4.  Something more along the lines of<br><br>Rogue 1<br>Paladin 5<br>Rogue 1<br>Paladin 4<br>Rogue 1<br>Paladin 4<br>Rogue 1<br>Paladin 2<br>CoT 1<br>-- Epic --<br>CoT 1<br>Rogue 1<br>CoT 4<br>Rogue 1<br>CoT 4<br>Rogue 7<br>Paladin 1<br><br>Would be best.  That gives tumble and UMD dumps on the multiple of 5 levels.  Plus it means you get your CoT Bonus feat as soon as you take your next epic one.  Your final feat is at 39th level, which this lets you grab as Epic Dodge if DEX based.

Level 39 is damned late for Epic Dodge. If one is aiming for that feat, it's generally much wiser to arrange to take it as early as feasible.<br><br>I'd still like to see his starting stats and race, as well as desired feats, in order to suggest how to level it.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I agree with Cinn about ED earlier. If you are looking for an ED build, and it's not for a level 40 server (i.e. you plan to actually play the low levels), I would adjust it to at least 14 Rogue levels so you can take ED earlier and get one more skill dump at level 37. Either Pal 16/Rogue 14/CoT 10 or even Pal 18/Rogue 14/CoT 8. The second option weakens Divine Wrath, but gets you moe Paladin spell slots.<br><br>For an ED build, I would probably look at Pal 12/Rogue 8 Pre-epic (feel free to sub CoT levels for Pal levels if you want any pre-epic bonus feats), with Rogue 13 taken at level 27 for ED. This leaves 2 non-Rogue Epic levels, which should probably be CoT for a bonus feat. Then one final Rogue level at 37. For the rest of Epic, probably focus on CoT first for the bonus feats, and finish up with the Paladin levels. This means you get Holy Sword late, but you can't get everything early, and ED is probably more important for a Dex build than HS.<br><br>Don't forget to put a few points into Cha, and take Divine Might to get some damage output (important for a dexer). That does mean you will need at least 13 in Str, too.<br><br>TM

So you can either delay it to level 38 to pump Tumble and UMD to 40, or take it earlier to get ED but then not be able to pump UMD and Tumble again afterward.

You have 8 in Str, Con and Cha, all useful abilities for a Paladin. Drop it to 18 to start, and put the 6 points in some of the other abilities. Also, decide how many skillpoints you really need - Discipline is a waste in an ED build with low Str, drop that one. I'd put some into Search and Disable Traps, which you don't have at all (mid 20's will do for those to take care of all but Epic traps). You may be able to drop Int to 12 and put those into something else as well. <br><br>For feats, I would add IKD for a Halfling build. I'd also add Toughness with the low Con - you need the HP.<br><br>Last, I hope you are looking at a high magic world - with daggers, an 8 Str, no WS/EWS, no Divine Might, and Cha too low to use Divine Wrath, you don't have a lot of ways to generate damage besides sneak damage. You can buff with GMW and Divine Favor for a few points, but that's about it. Bless Weapon will help with undead, but if you face anything else that's sneak resistant (dragons, constructs, etc.), you will have a tough time. You will really need some weapons with good enhancement and elemental damages to make up for that.<br><br>You may want to consider dropping CoT for Fighter. With the low Cha, you aren't making use of the CoT abilities anyway (except the save bonus). Fighter would let you pick up WS/EWS for 6 more damage, and raising Str to 12 or 14 as I suggested above would add 2-3 more. Another 8-9 points per hit makes a big difference, especially if you face anything with DR.<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 08/09/07 02:10</span></i></p>
