<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>Originally posted on April 24th,<br><a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=343861&amp;forum=77&amp;sp=120" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br>9th post down.<br><br>I was considering the stereotypical high-dex-dual-wielding-archer ranger, and decided if it were done well it might not be half bad. Well, after some consideration, I decided that multiclassed with fighter and paladin this could work well. With epic weapon specialization, divine might and divine shield, you end up with a high AC finesse fighter that does damage that would put some strength builds to shame (against the favoured enemies at least). The character also has a decent AB with bows and dual wielding. The stat mix turned out badly however and spell casting had to be abandoned. Not one of my best builds, but definitely not one of my worst. This is definitely a character that does better in high rather than low magic settings. Then again all pure melee builds are stronger in high magic settings (really what can a pure melee build do with no magic items?). Let me know what you guys think?<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br><br>-Does a lot of damage with a longbow.  With divine might, some of the damage is divine which is hard to resist.  With favoured enemy, bane of enemies and epic weapon specialization the arrows do a lot of damage without buffs.<br>-Does a lot of damage dual wielding shortswords.  Again, divine might adds divine damage to all attacks, making it hard to resist.  Even without divine might he does a lot of damage to favoured enemies.<br>-A good AC thanks to divine shield and a 30 DEX.<br>-Some stealth and trap setting abilities.  If he can't hurt an opponent in melee he has an alternative.<br><br><i>Disadvantages</i><br><br>-Poor will saves.  The fortitude and reflex saves are okay but without evasion they don't do much good.  Spell casters will cause trouble for this character.<br>-Mediocre hit points.  Not good, but not bad.<br>-No spell casting ability.<br>-Only 5 favoured enemies.  He is going to be very good at killing a select group of opponents.  If you know what you're facing this isn't a problem, but if you could be facing a wide assortment of enemies this character will not do well.<br>-Major XP penalty.<br><br><b>War Scout of Correllon</b><br><br><i>Race</i> Elf<br><br><i>Alignment</i> Lawful Good<br><br><i>Base Attributes</i><br>STR 14<br>DEX 18<br>CON 10<br>WIS 8<br>INT 12<br>CHA 14<br><br><i>Leveling Guide</i><br>Levels 1-3 Fighter<br>Levels 4-5 Ranger<br>Level 6 Fighter<br>Levels 7-9 Paladin<br>Levels 10-11 Ranger<br>Level 12 Paladin<br>Levels 13-14 Ranger<br>Level 15 Paladin<br>Levels 16-33 Ranger<br>Levels 34-39 Fighter<br>Level 40 Ranger<br><br><i>Final Level Distribution</i><br>Fighter 10<br>Paladin 5<br>Ranger 25<br><br><i>Animal Companion</i> Panther<br><br><i>Attribute Bonuses</i><br>4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 go to dexterity<br>28, 32, 36 and 40 go to charisma <br><br><i>Feats</i><br>Level 1: Weapon Focus (Shortsword), Weapon Finesse <br>Level 2: Weapon Focus (Longbow)<br>Level 3: Power Attack<br>Level 4: Favoured Enemy (Undead)<br>Level 6: Weapon Specialization (Shortsword), Weapon Specialization (Longbow)<br>Level 9: Divine Might<br>Level 12: Divine Shield<br>Level 13: Favoured Enemy (Elf)<br>Level 15: Extra Turning<br>Level 18: Improved Critical (Shortsword)<br>Level 19: Favoured Enemy (Dwarf)<br>Level 21: Epic Weapon Focus (Longbow)<br>Level 24: Favoured Enemy (Human), Great Dexterity I<br>Level 27: Great Dexterity II<br>Level 29: Favoured Enemy (Half-Orc)<br>Level 30: Great Dexterity III<br>Level 32: Bane of Enemies<br>Level 33: Great Dexterity IV,<br>Level 35: Epic Weapon Focus (Shortsword)<br>Level 36: Great Dexterity V<br>Level 37: Epic Weapon Specialization (Longbow)<br>Level 39: Epic Weapon Specialization (Shortsword), Great Dexterity VI<br>Level 40: Epic Prowess<br> <br><i>Final Attributes</i><br>STR 14<br>DEX 30<br>CON 10<br>WIS 8<br>INT 12<br>CHA 18<br><br><i>Final Saves</i><br>Fortitude 29<br>Reflexes 29<br>Will 18<br><br><i>Skillpoints</i> 179<br>Discipline 43<br>Hide 24<br>Move Silently 24<br>Set Trap 8<br>Spellcraft 20<br>Tumble 20<br><br><i>Skillpoint Distribution</i><br>Level 1: Discipline 4, Spellcraft 2, Tumble 2<br>Level 2: Discipline 1, Save 2<br>Level 3: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 4: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Save 2<br>Level 5: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 6: Discipline 1, Save 2<br>Level 7: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 8: Discipline 1, Save 2<br>Level 9: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 10: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Save 2<br>Level 11: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 12: Discipline 1, Save 2<br>Level 13: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 14: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Save 2<br>Level 15: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 16: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Save 2<br>Level 17: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 18: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Save 2<br>Level 19: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 20: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Save 2<br>Level 21: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 22: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Save 2<br>Level 23: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 24: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Save 2<br>Level 25: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 26: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Save 2<br>Level 27: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 28: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Save 2<br>Level 29: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 30: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Save 2<br>Level 31: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 32: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Save 2<br>Level 33: Discipline 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 34: Discipline 1, Save 2<br>Level 35: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 36: Discipline 1, Save 2<br>Level 37: Discipline 1, Spellcraft 1, Tumble 1<br>Level 38: Discipline 1, Save 2<br>Level 39: Discipline 1, Save 4<br>Level 40: Discipline 1, Set Trap 8<br><br><i>AB and Damage</i><br>(no buffs, two normal shortswords)<br>42/37/32/27 8+1D6 (17-20 X2)<br>42/37 7+1D6 (17-20 X2)<br>(44/39/34/29  13+3D6 (17-20 X2) Vs.
