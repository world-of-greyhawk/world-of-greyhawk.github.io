I was thinkin about a build usin a monk and unarmed/kama wpns.  I have built 2 versions of the character (which i will post soon, after i check to see if the idea is already done), but the ab for both is around 31 - 32 respectively, at lv 40 (that is unarmd stat).  <br><br>I was wondering if this is decent for a monk build?   <br><br>I guess the ab could be highr if i increased str (its at 14).  I have taken wf and ewf in unarmd and epic prowess.  I was wondering why the ab seems so low for a weapon focused weapon?   <br><br>Any ideas?<br><br>Thanks for any help.

That what a pure monk would have if you took all the focuses and epic prowess, but didn't pump the stat determining the AB (STR or DEX with weapon finesse).  Without knowing more about the build, especially where you spent your stat points, it's hard to judge, but generally a dex monk with weapon finesse would have an unarmed naked AB of about 39-40 (probably a strength based one would be similar).  Is this going to be some sort of cleric or druid mix pumping wisdom?  If you have buffs to boost it, that should make up for it.  But without knowing about that....based solely on the AB you've listed, that seems fairly low compared to the monk builds I've seen/played.  But if it's a buffing character, then it might not matter as much.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 06/04/05 06:26</span></i></p>
