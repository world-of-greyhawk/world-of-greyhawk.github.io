Hello. I'm new to NWN and I'm looking for a good solo build. I'm not ready to start creating my own builds yet so I was hoping for some advice.

Are you planning on playing single player or multiplayer? If you're going multiplayer, then first you need to befriend one of the veterans so that they can tell you what kind of world it is, low-mid-high magic, items, etc. But if you're just starting out, i'd go with a cleric build first, just to get the hang of things, then move on to something a little more difficult.

I'm going to be playing single player for now. Eventually I'd like to try multi-player but I don't plan on doing that for awhile.<br><br>So would you suggest one of the cleric builds here or just a pure cleric?

one of the most versatile melee oriented characters around is probably the fighter/rogue/COT combination.  Good AB, damage output, saves as well as the wide selection of rogue skills.  It leaves a lot of room for customizing the character to your likes as it is both feat and skill rich.  Do a search of these classes and you'll turn up quite a few.  One of my favorites is Grizzled Dwarflord's <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "213875", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Death's Rival</a><br>_________________<br>In order to find his equal, an Irishman is forced to talk to<br>God.

Regarding Dev Crit in general, most environments ban it outright, though there are a few here and there that allow it.  In Singleplayer, many players don't find it challenging and that it takes away the fun and joy of the game.  I'm of that mindset, but I'll admit there are days when I come home from work, tired, stressed, pissed-off, and I just need to sit down and play a violent filthy Half-orc who ravages everything, and if I'm going to go, I might as well go all the way with Dev Crit.

Glad to be of help, and happy to share.  Let it be known that the best builds are the ones you build yourself, sometimes from scratch, sometimes organically, and sometimes based on something else you've seen and tweaked to your playstyle or environment.  Opinions abound in this regard, and it is often a good idea to use other players as sounding boards to bounce ideas off.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;I took a look at Death's Rival, as Highlander77 suggested.

One is strength-based and one is not.  The Bounty Hunter probably is quite adept at most confrontations, being strength-based, while Death's Rival is more of a stealth specialist and truly shines in Epic.  Because I tend to play a lot of 1-30 environments, I tend to play things that mature earlier rather than later, and thus would recommend The Bounty Hunter build over that.  If the two were forced to fight one another at, say, Level28, I'm putting my money on Death's Rival.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;The other two builds I'm still considering are <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "250880", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Assault and Battery (Bard 3/ Fighter 12/ Weapon Master 25)</a> and <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "253541", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Shock and Awe: Barbarian7/Rogue17/Fighter16</a> Both of these builds look powerful and fun, and since they both have a high UMD they look to be versital as well.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --> Assault and Battery is a heavy damager, make no mistake.  However, that's pretty much the extent of his capabilities in pre-epic, unless you wanted to start switching some Bard levels around.  His lack of UMD combined with his low Will save make him a sitting duck unless in a high magic environment with lots of immunties.  Until then, he has to wait until Level22 to get "versatile" and "3-dimensional".  If it were me, I'd probably slop 3 Bard levels in there pre-epic and then 3 more in Epic.  Help Will save, get you UMD, Tumble, Spellcraft much earlier, and make him 100 times more "playable".<br><br>Shock and Awe is, well, just that.  He's a monster, in every sense of the word, and is good filthy fun.  I'm currently playing him on a PW and he ravages everything around him.  Even when he should die, he doesn't.  Dev crit is built in with this build, but it's easily built out if you prefer not to play with it or find yourself in an environment where it's banned.<br><br>Hope that helps.  If it's any consolation, about every week I see a build around here that I want to play, so I quickslot the build into my cue.  I'll start it on a PW or SP game, and while it may not get immediate playtime, they eventually do, and have played quite a few builds on here and elsewhere.  Lots of good ones, with lots of ideas to experiment, theories to test, combos to perfect, and so on, that really there never seems to be "an end".<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
