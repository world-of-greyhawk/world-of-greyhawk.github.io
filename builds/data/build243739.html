Not bad.  My only suggestion is to move Harper1 to Level22 to gain 1 more AC on your Tumble drop.<br><br>As for the Harper Scout use in a build like this, I can't help but think that 3 levels of Rogue or Bard would be of more value.  Fighter/Weapon Masters are so 1 dimensional, and as a result, so vulnerable, they would highly benefit from a Rogue or Bard's skill sets than they would a Harper Scout's.  But that's just me, and to each his own.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

You know what Grizz, I can't believe I missed that. And here was me thinking I had put it at 22nd level. I'll have to adjust that.<br><br>You are mainly right in terms of the support that a Bard/ Rogue brings to a Fighter WM, but the HS brings you more help to your Will save.

But in an environment where you could at least buy scrolls, I would argue otherwise.  One could still take Iron Will freely without being a prereq, and one could certainly take Epic Will on a general feat.  With 6 bonus feats coming at Epic levels here, you could certainly afford it.  Further, the Rogue or Bard could cast just about any spell you desire from scroll, and if you are in a party with a scribing caster, he could just create for you what you need, and he can save his spells for big boss fights.  <br><br>The point I am trying to make is, I would much rather have the capacity to cast Lesser Mind Blank, Mind Blank, Clarity, Protection from Alignment and Protection from Spells, or Death Ward and Shadowshield, Premonition and Improved Invis, etc, than have to rely on a Harper Bonus feat and Tymora's smile.  <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;A shame HS does not get Uncanny Dodge, then I'd be changing this to a DEX based version, but hey</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->I find there to be many things ashame about the Harper class-- it had the potential to be so much.
