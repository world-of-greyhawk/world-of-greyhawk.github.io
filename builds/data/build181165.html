After typing a rather long post on the Uberness of Wizard/Cleric builds (the post can be found here: <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=412333&amp;forum=42%29," target="_blank">Click Here</a> I decided to create one myself.  It turned out very similar to cdualepp's Dragon Kin build, but of course it uses Cleric rather than Druid.  <br><br>This allows the build to be more effective in caster form - particularly in melee - partly because he has all the uber Cleric buffs, and partly because his stats aren't quite so gimped.  <br><br>However, he isn't quite as effective in Dragon form (he can shift into a dragon using Polymorph Self), although I think Iron Golem form would be more useful, as it makes him immune to criticals and sneak attacks (I seem to recall billb0 saying how <a href="mailto:bad@$$">bad@$$</a> it would be to have an Iron Golem with Epic Warding + Mestil's Acid Sheath + Elemental Shield + Death Armor; this build can do it).  <br><br>Anyway, without further ado, here's the build:<br><br><br>Monk 2/Cleric 15/Wizard 23<br>(pre-epic Monk 1/Cleric 15/Wizard 4)<br><br>Race: Gnome<br><br>Domains: War and Healing<br><br><br>Stats<br><br>Starting:<br><br>Str 8 <br>Dex 14<br>Con 16<br>Int 16<br>Wis 14<br>Cha 8<br><br>+2 Wis, +8 Dex<br><br>Ending:<br><br>Str 8<br>Dex 26<br>Con 16<br>Int 19<br>Wis 18<br>Cha 8<br><br><br><br>Feats<br><br>Pre-epic:<br><br>1 Two-Weapon Fighting<br>3 Weapon Focus: Kama<br>6 Ambidexterity<br>9 Extend Spell<br>12 Knockdown<br>15 Empower Spell<br>18 ITWF<br>21 Epic Weapon Focus: Kama, Great Int I *<br>24 Great Dex I<br>26 Great Int II *<br>27 Great Dex II<br>30 Great Dex III<br>31 Great Int III *<br>33 Great Dex IV<br>36 Craft Wand, Maximize Spell *<br>39 Epic Mage Armor, Epic Warding *<br><br>Wizard bonus Feats *<br><br><br>Epic Level Progression<br><br>21-39 Wizard<br>40    Monk<br><br><br>Skills: <br><br>Concentration: 43<br>Discipline:    43<br>Healing:       43<br>Lore:          25<br>Listen:        43<br>Spellcraft:    40<br>Tumble:        40<br><br><br>Total: ~277 skill credits <br><br><br>AB: 23 base<br>    +8 Dex<br>    +1 WF<br>    +2 EWF<br>    +1 Small Stature<br>    -2 Dual-wield<br>    -2 Flurry of Blows<br>    ______<br>    31 w/ mundane Kamas<br><br>    +7 Divine Power<br>    +5 Divine Favor<br>    +5 Greater Magic Weapon<br>    +1 Bless<br>    +1 Prayer<br>    +1 Aid<br>    +1-4 Empowered Cat's Grace'<br>    +2   Extended Aura of Vitality<br>    ______<br>    54-57 fully buffed<br><br>AC: 10 base<br>    +8 Dex <br>    +8 Tumble<br>    +4 Wisdom AC<br>    +1 Small Stature<br>    ______<br>    31 naked AC<br> <br>    +5 Shadow Shield (Natural AC)<br>    +5 Magic Vestment (Armor AC)<br>    +5 Armor of Faith (Deflection AC)<br>    +5 Epic Mage Armor (Dodge AC)<br>    +4 Haste (Dodge AC)<br>    +1-4 Empowered Cat's Grace (Dex AC) <br>    +1-4 Empowered Owl's Wisdom (Wis AC)<br>    +2   Extended Aura of Vitality (Dex AC)<br>    ______<br>    59-65 fully buffed <br><br><br>Note that Epic Mage Armor will give you +20 AC total, and it doesn't stack with the three spells above it.

I am sorry to bring this topic back to life, but it's just amazing that I have a very similar build with only a few minor tweaks and ONE MAJOR TWEAK and I was about to post it. I think it's totally undeserved that this topic has no replies. Only when you've played a guy like this can you understand his power. Rather than posting another build and hearing it's a copy of this one, I'll post my comments here:<br><br>- MAJOR TWEAK: WHERE THE HELL IS WEAPON FINESSE?????? You need to drop a feat and pick it up at lvl 3. IMO dropping KD is best.<br><br>- Go Cleric 14, then Wizard 1, then Cleric 15, then Wizard 2, then Monk 1 and then another 2 Wizard pre-epic. This way you can avoid XP penalties until lvl 18. The Cleric won't be able to cast lvl 8 spells until the stat increase at lvl 16, so that why you pick a lvl of Wizard at 15 unless u're a lazy one and don't wanna click too much. Swap the feat orders to get WF: Kama at lvl 18 and just use a dagger and a shield until then. You can benefit from another Magic Vestment spell on your shield as well as your armor for more AC until you get the monk CHEESE. Besides at that point you'll have enough DEX and WIS to make it worth it. Before then, you get more AC from the shield + Magic Vestment.<br><br>- You don't need STR 8, drop it to 6 and get +1 INT, you'll get an increased modifier and extra spells at virtually no cost (except lvl 1 carrying capacity).<br><br>- I chose the same domains and virtually the same spells, but some different feats in the epic portion of the build. Here's what I did (I went with Elf and started with 18 DEX):<br><br>1- Extend Spell<br>3- Weapon Finesse<br>6- Empower Spell<br>9- TWF<br>12- Ambidexterity<br>15- ITWF<br>18- WF: Kama<br>21- Improved Critical: Kama<br>24- EWF: Kama<br>27- Armor Skin<br>30- Epic Prowess<br>33- Great Dex I<br>36- Great Dex II<br>39- Epic Warding<br>Wiz Bonus Feats - Great Int I, II, III, IV, Epic Mage Armor.<br><br>I think Maximize spell is expendable, but if you really want it, drop Epic Prowess. It's unnecessary with the ridiculous amount of buffs you have.<br><br>- About getting Craft Wand, it's not worth it, seriously. THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH THIS BUILD IS THE LACK OF SLOTS IN YOUR TOOLBAR!!!! No way I'd use wands to have even less slots!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>Anyway, awesome job, really, except for the weapon finesse slip this is 1st class material!!<br><br>Take it EZ!

Wow.  Can't believe this slipped through.  It's clearly supposed to have WF, and it just as clearly doesn't.  Oops.<br><br>The rest is arguable.  The only suggested tweak I can actively disagree with is dropping Craft Wand.  <i>Love</i> Craft.  I'd love it double in this build.  Quickslots aren't really an issue for me.  I'm fine using wands out of an inventory, and I'd certainly keep my buffs out of the quickbar.  Anyways though, you don't like it, you don't like it. I like it.

I don't see any dire need to make him Gnome.  Change the Race to Human, and voila.

@ onion eater<br><br>I keep my hour/level and extended turn/level buffs out of the quickbar cuz I walk around already buffed up. But the round/level, extended round/level buffs plus True Strike and Divine Favor / Extended Divine Favor need to be accessible in the blink of an eye. And even so there are not enough quickslots, or rather, JUST ENOUGH quickslots. But, if you can use them from you inventory, then cool.<br><br>The downside to this guy (if any) is that you spend half an hour buffing to fight 5 minutes.<br><br>@ Grizzled_Dwarflord<br><br>You're right, no argument here, but I am sure it was a slip cuz he lists his AB and everything else AS IF he had finesse, except he doesn't <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Take it EZ!
