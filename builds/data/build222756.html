As to weapon proficiency, human v. elf, seems like you could use the extra feat for being human to take martial weapon and live happy and free with an even better weapon selection and 40 extra skill points.  If you start at 14 charisma instead of 16, you can still start - and end - with a pretty high dexterity.

Is this guy supposed to just hide and sing for his party? Sure you have bull's strenght, but you have to count also on STR enhancing items if you wanna get a decent damage output. AB is really low (btw, why no WF/EWF???), but buffs should make it decent, at least... just trying to understand how you use this character<br><br>Now, lasting inspiration should be taken ASAP and not on 40th lvl IMO. Take ESF: perform as your last feat on 23rd bard lvl instead(ESF is in the epic bard bonus feat list). With 23 bards lvl <b> and </b> lasting inspiration, you're not gonna need extra music either, I suggest to drop it for a) a save booster, b) WF c) empower spell. As for SF: perform, you fall short of 65 perform anyhow so you could drop that either and drop CHA to 16 too. This way your modified perform is 56 which is enough for a lvl 21 bard song giving you +9 to skills...including perform (65 modified), eh-eh. Next song after the first is a 23rd lvl song already. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">  <br><br>Less bard and more fighter would give you a stronger melee presence but you must forego LI and go for at least 4 FTR to grab WS/EWS (and WF/EWF too!!!)<br><br>As a final nore, lvling up with 6 STR and 8 CON is gonna be hard...real hard.

Actually, I really really like this one.<br><br>Especially because it has lasting inspiration, epic dodge and sc5, my fave feats. <br><br>I would try to make it a dual wielder with rapier, for the crit range, and get it some more weapon focus etc. And ditch extra music and lingering songs, as you dont need those with so many bard levels and lasting (at least on my server). <br><br>Dont forget it is a high dex build with a nice curse song. If you make this guy a decent taunter (by ditching spelcraft for instance) you can add some points to his ab. <br><br>Hmm, i like this idea.

How on earth are you gonna level this? Even when you get HiPS it won't help, because you can't even hurt a baby goblin! It is a fine party char at lvl 40, but i would like to see the setting you won't die time and again with this guy. Sorry to be so harsh, but that's the way it is.<br><br>A quick question. What's his damage potential at lvl 40? Not just unbuffed, naked and all that. I mean, what's his potential with his spells and all counted for?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 12/09/05 11:37</span></i></p>

Even in a party, 6 str and 8 con is gonna hurt you alot as you level up.<br><br>There's no point in starting with 16 cha - you can free up 4 base stat points to start with 12 con right there.<br><br>I find it's kind of counterproductive to be a buff-centric build that's not over the dispel cap.  I'd suggest you siphon 3 of those SD levels off and put them into bard levels so that your buffs can't be dispelled except by disjunction.<br><br>And since you're over the dispel cap now and because bards get both displacement and improved invisibility as class spells... you can drop SC 5 - that'll free up a lot of feats.  You can still be disjunctioned but... freeing five epic feats is a pretty reasonable tradeoff I think.<br><br>Those extra feats can go to EWF, epic prowess, armor skin and two great dexes.<br><br>Drop lingering song and take lasting inspiration earlier, consider dropping extra music.  Get a weapon focus in there instead.<br><br>Now you still won't do much damage but at least you can hit things if you have to.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Yeah, Xylo's right, get over the dispel cap and free up 5 feats. And since to get ED asap you are gonna take it on a standard feat slot you might want to drop SD to 10 lvls and get 3 more figthers to qualify for WS/EWS. You then be a hell of a buffer and get some melee presence. You just have to worry for disjunction but you can always recast your II as needed<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

well spotted... I'd dump extra music - really no use with 23 bard levels.<br><br>swap lingering for curse song as you take lasting inspiration later on - you can switch it round to take it earlier with a little tweaking<br><br>Why Fighter? just for the extra feat and the Wpn Prof Martial? Go Paladin to get the benefit of the CHA bonus - sure you need an alignment change, but taken at first should be ok.
