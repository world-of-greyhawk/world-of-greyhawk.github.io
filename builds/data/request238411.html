Based<br>Epic Feats - as many as possible <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  need to get those Great *insert ability* feats on the go!<br><br>My current thoughts are with a 20/4/16 Dex Based Paladin/Ftr/Rogue with all Ftr levels in the Epic levels!<br><br>Cleric levels would be desireable, for healing purposes, however not essential, though less buff dependable also desireable!<br><br>Anyone got any thoughts or good ideas?

Well, my first thought as soon as you said "True Seeing is nerfed" was Shadowdancer.<br><br>How about something like Rogue 8/SD 10/WM 22? Dex-based, obviously, and probably human for the feats to qualify for WM. You could drop Rogue for Fighter, will make getting the WM feats easier, but cost you a lot of skillpoints for cross-classing to qualify for SD. Or you could drop WM for fighter, makes it easy to get the feats and skills, but costs some AB.<br><br>TM

He can get +65 AB fully buffed and his AC can get to 50 with mundane gear.

going by the description of the server, and the fact I've seen krsboss both on the forum, and in game, I think he is talking about Bastions of War (BoW).<br><br>Hips is removed there, and it is possible to max out pretty much any skill short of disc, (hide and spot included) though it requires sacrifice in other skills and character abilites and usually a high level bard song.

Then drop the Jormundgandr option, BoW is bad for dragons, they nerfed them mercilessy.
