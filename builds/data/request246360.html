(Copies and Pasted from the Pre-Epic Character Builders Guild. It is a build that I made with some suggestions from Cinnabar Din, Finious, and Thax; but there may very well be some work to be done with it, so that is why I post it here).<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Bard 15/ Fighter 5/ RDD 10<br>Race: Human, with possible Subrace<br>Alignment: Chaotic Neutral, Maybe Chaotic Good<br><br>Strength: 16 (30)<br>Dexterity: 8<br>Constitution: 14 (16)<br>Intelligence: 14<br>Wisdom: 8<br>Charisma: 15 (18)<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Bard 1: Toughness, Heavy Armour Proficiency<br>Bard 2:<br>Bard 3: Martial Weapon Proficiency<br>Bard 4: Charisma +1<br>Bard 5: <br>Bard 6: Weapon Focus Scimitar<br>Bard 7:<br>Bard 8: Strength +1<br>Bard 9: Curse Song<br>Bard 10:<br>Bard 11:<br>Bard 12: Strength +1, Knockdown<br><br>Fighter 1: Improved Knockdown<br>Fighter 2: Improved Critical Scimitar<br>Fighter 3: Extend Spell<br>Fighter 4: Strength +1, Weapon Specialization Scimitar<br><br>RDD 1:<br>RDD 2: Blind Fight (Empowered Spell Better?)<br>RDD 3:<br>RDD 4: Strength +1<br>RDD 5: Epic Weapon Focus Scimitar<br>RDD 6:<br>RDD 7:<br>RDD 8: Strength +1, Epic Prowess<br>RDD 9: <br>RDD 10:<br><br>Fighter 5: Epic Weapon Specialization Scimitar<br><br>Bard 13: Strength +1<br>Bard 14:<br>Bard 15: Armour Skin, Skill Dump Time<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Mundane Equipment, Unbuffed:<br><br>Attack Bonus: 35/30/25/20<br>Damage Output: 1-6 + 16 (15-20 /x2)<br>Armour Class: 32<br><br>Fortitude: 20<br>Will: 17<br>Reflex: 14<br><br>Hit Points: 300<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Mundane Equipment, Buffed:<br><br>Attack Bonus: 45/40/35/30/45<br>Damage Output: 1-6 + 27 (12-20 /x2)<br>Armour Class: 46<br><br>Fortitude: 22<br>Will: 19<br>Reflex: 18<br><br>Hit Points: 316<br><br>--------------------<br><br>+3 Server Equipment, Buffed:<br><br>Attack Bonus: 47/42/37/32/47<br>Damage Output: 1-6 + 29 (12-20 /x2)<br>Armour Class: 55<br><br>Fortitude: 23<br>Will: 20<br>Reflex: 19<br><br>Hit Points: 346<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Notes: This build gets the full attack scheme with 4 attacks per round, and it gets Epic Weapon Specialization from the Fighter levels; it makes full use of the Fighter Class and squeezes out all it can.<br><br>I took the 10 RDD levels for the higher Hit Points through Constitution, as well as the immunities to things like Flame Weapon, Darkfire, and all Fire Oriented Spells which are commonly used on my server.<br><br>There are a few feats that are subject to change such as Armour Skin and Blindfight. Empowered Spell may take the place of Blindfight of that won't bother you, and Armour Skin might be changed for Epic Skill Focus: Discipline. IKD is an issue on my server, and a +10 Bonus will go nicely with my exceedingly high Strength.<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Strengths and Strategies: <br><br>-Darkness/Ultravision is one of my favourites. It gives an incredible advantage if you have Ultravision and your opponent doesn't, while under the presence of Darkness. Luckily, this can be done even while wearing your Full Plate and Tower Shield.<br><br>-Taunt will give you the edge over spell-focussed casters by forcing them into attack, and lowering their chance of success in their castings.<br><br>-Curse Song will work well when brought together with Darkness and Taunt. It succesfully furthers the damage done to your opponents condition, making them all the easier to actually hit and kill.<br><br>-Dirge, though a Save is applied and your DC's are low, is still effective. Since it has a duration, the enemy will have to make multiple Saves and may eventually fail one, which will even further their growing weaknesses. If you have the first initiative, this may be a good spell to cast in the area the fight will take place.<br><br>-With a huge Critical Threat range, and enormous Strength, a Critical Hit will land around 60-80 Damage, with 30-40 on a normal hit which is quite nice with 5 attacks per round, hasted.<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Weaknesses:<br><br>-Grossly low Saves. All are below 25, which is somewhat disheartening.<br><br>-Not really a weakness, but I wish I had more Skill Points, but I can't sacrifice any Attribute Points to Intelligence.<br><br>-Cannot cast while in combat due to Arcane Spell Failure, so if buffs get Dispelled, they will not be coming back until the fight is over.<br><br>-If dispelled, the AB is greatly diminished along with AC. It is a major concern, though if there is time to cast Expedius Retreat, not all is lost.<br><br>--------------------<br><br>That is everything I think. Tips, Critique, Help?

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">  Why the change to this guild? it's still a level 30 build.<br><br>Well, some very important changes: first, take Fighter at level 1 or 2 (2 is better to retain level 1 Bard skillpoints), that will give you Heavy Armor and Martial Weapon for free. You can now take Empowered spell and Blind-Fight, and still a free feat, I don't know what you would like, saves boost, Called Shot, Music feat, Power Attack, Expertise, whatever you like the most.<br><br>The rest is ok, keep Armor Skin, maybe take EWS earlier...

Well, only problem with taking Fighter earlier, is that it has to either be my 1st level, or 4th level.<br><br>With my server, once you take a class, you cant take a different class until you complete 3 levels in the first one. It makes things complicated and I dont know if losing the skills are worth it. I will think on that, good point though. Feats are in short supply.<br><br>And I moved it over here so I can get more opinions. I like gathering all the information.

Alright, more good stuff! Awesome.<br><br>One question though. I noticed that when Bard's multiclass into RDD, and they get the +2 to Charisma, it doesn't allow them to use higher level spells.<br><br>Lets say I had 14 Charisma, and never added naturally, but got it to 16 based on the RDD Bonus.

Something wrong with the game, or me?

Bards learn new spells at level X, but can't cast them until level X+1 unless their CHA modifier grants a bonus spell of that level. For example, a level 16 Bard knows 2 level 6 spells, but cannot cast any of them until Bard level 17, unless he has a CHA of 22 (which grants a bonus level 6 spell per day). If you look at the table of Bard spellcasting in one of the manuals, you'll see an entry that shows 0 casts per day. This means you can only cast spells of that level with a Bard of a particular level if you get bonus spells from high CHA.<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...
