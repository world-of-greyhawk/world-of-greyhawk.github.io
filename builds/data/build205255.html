Well, let me start of by first stressing that this probably isnt playable from 1-40, it might be, but it would probably take quite a lot of patience.  Also, I generally prefer shifters with lots of shapes, this is for me more a curiosity than anything else.  Well, that said, here goes:<br><br>Race Halfling<br>Str 8, Dex 20, Con 10, Wis 14, Int 12, Cha 8<br>Alignment : any Neutral<br><br>Level 1: Druid, Alertness<br>Level 2: Druid<br>Level 3: Druid, Dodge<br>Level 4: Druid, Dex +1<br>Level 5: Druid<br>Level 6: Shifter, Mobility<br>Level 7: Shifter<br>Level 8: Shifter, Dex +1<br>Level 9: Shifter, Toughness<br>Level 10: Shifter<br>Level 11: Shifter<br>Level 12: Shifter, Dex +1, empower spell<br>Level 13: Druid (Hide 10, MS 8, Tumble 5 by this point)<br>Level 14: SD<br>Level 15: SD, Wpn prof exotic<br>Level 16: SD, Dex +1<br>Level 17: SD<br>Level 18: Druid, wpn focus scythe<br>Level 19: Shifter<br>Level 20: Druid, Dex +1<br>Level 21: SD, EWF scythe<br>Level 22: SD<br>Level 23: Shifter<br>Level 24: Shifter, Dex +1, Undead shape<br>Level 25: SD<br>Level 26: SD<br>Level 27: SD, great dex 1<br>Level 28: SD, Dex +1<br>Level 29: SD<br>Level 30: SD, Epic Dodge<br>Level 31: SD, Epic Shadowlord<br>Level 32: SD, Dex +1<br>Level 33: SD, great dex 2<br>Level 34: SD, SC 1<br>Level 35: SD<br>Level 36: SD, Dex +1, SC2<br>Level 37: SD, SC 3<br>Level 38: SD<br>Level 39: SD, SC4<br>Level 40: SD, Dex +1, SC5<br><br>So I ended with the following skills:<br><br>Heal 27, Hide 43, MS 43, Listen 43, Animal Empathy 27, Spellcraft 23, Tumble 40<br><br>In halfling form, the character is a good sneaker but useless at pretty much anything else, however transforming into a 6 foot tall skelleton with a big scythe, things change a little, he gains 50% immunity to piercing and slashing attacks and DR of 15/+3, this coupled with epic dodge and 50% undispellable concealment makes him really quite hard to damage, given that he has total immunity to critical hits and sneak attacks as well.<br><br>Saves @ lv 40 (shifted to risen lord) = fort 28, ref 34, will 22 (+4 to all vs spells)<br><br>Naked AC at lv 40 (again shifted) = 42<br><br>Max HP at level 40 (again shifted) = 580<br><br>Naked Attack Schedule at level 40 (shifted again) = 38/33/28 <br><br>Comments and suggestions are welcome as ever<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By M1ke47 on 07/22/05 19:24</span></i></p>

Wow.  Pretty Neat.  At a glance, this is a really interesting build.  obviously he will have some trouble earlier on, but as you mentioned, as a risen lord, he looks pretty tough.<br>I had to double check about the hide skill for shifters.  it works though.  looks like fun.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger."

i cant find weapon finesse in the build, is that an oversight not to profit from that in a dex build?

Firstly you dont get a choice of weapons in a shifted form afaik. <br><br>Also I would drop epic shadowlord. <br><br>To compare the differences between them ill show you the epic shadowlord first and the non epic second<br><br>AC 22   22<br>HP 231/70 (this may seem like a lot of a difference but ill show you why it isnt)<br>AB +26/21/16    +8 (neither is going to be slaughtering your opponent)<br>Damage 1-6+13/1-6+13/2-12+29   1-8+5/1-8+5/2-12+5 <br><br>The epic shadowlord really has the edge here in that if it lands a hit it does good damage. However defensively it does not have concealment. The non-epic shadowlord has effectively 140 hp because of its concealment. So in melee both will last as long as each other near enough. The real difference is the offense of the epic. And with AB 26 both are hitting only on a roll of 20 against most opponents.This puts both in the meat shield category for absorbing blows both of which are nearly equally as good.<br> <br>Of course should they ever fix the fact that the epic shadowlord doesnt have concealment my opinion on this would change.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

Your str is overridden anyway so don't bother improving that.<br>2) Most forms that use finessable weapons (eg kobold form) already are given weapon finess for free.<br>3) Your druid form is always your weakest form of all, so taking something more useful instead of finesse would be better.

I don't do Shifters, but I would change the following:<br><br>Level 30: SD, Epic Dodge<br>Level 31: SD, Epic Shadowlord<br>Level 32: SD, Dex +1<br>Level 33: SD, great dex 2<br>Level 34: SD, SC 1<br>Level 35: SD<br>Level 36: SD, Dex +1, SC2<br>Level 37: SD, SC 3<br>Level 38: SD<br>Level 39: SD, SC4<br>Level 40: SD, Dex +1, SC5<br><br>to this:<br>30: SD12, Great Dex<br>31 SD13, Epic Dodge<br>32 SD14, Dex30<br>33 SD15, SC I<br>34 SD16, SC II<br>35 SD17<br>36 SD18, SC III, Dex 31<br>37Druid<br>38Druid<br>39Druid, SC IV<br>40SD19, SC V, Dex 32<br><br>Not sure which is better to take at 37-29, either Druid or Shifter, but you can do just as much with 19SD as you could with 22.  And you'll note that he gets SC V, gets SC earlier, and you can use your Druid to top out Spellcraft.  Or you can take 3 Shifter levels in their and get either another shape or take a Great Wisdom bonus feat.<br><br>Anyways, just a suggestion, and one that I think would make the build more powerful.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Nice, looks like an improvement, I realised earlier today at work that the ED could definately be shifted to an SD bonus feat, but the maxing out spellcraft is pretty good as well, especially with the fairly good saving throws already.  The dex does however drop to 30 when shifted because 2 points of it are a racial feature of halflings.  <br><br>Thanks for the comments so far folks.
