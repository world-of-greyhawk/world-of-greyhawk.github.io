Trapping, Sneaking, Piercing and Hunting Down Favored Enemies PvP and PvM (1-40)<br><br>DIVINE RANGER (Knight of the Woods)<br>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar<br><br>Concept: Wandering the North lands and patrolling the woods, with his loyal and trusty Dire Wolf by his side, in search of the most abominable of beasts, his favored enemies, for which he is ever watchful and always listening for, in order to hunt it down and slay it. <br><br>Strengths &amp; Weaknesses: SEVEN (7) Favored Enemies!<br>A STR-based, dual-wielding and non-dispelable ranger having very good, buffable AB, with serious damage output: bolstered by 5d6 Sneak and 6+2d6 Bane Damage as against every playable race in the game (there being no immunity to bane damage); together with decent trapping, full UMD and Divine Wrath, this combination – namely, Ranger, Rogue and CoT – is the first of its kind, and makes for a unique and powerful, yet playable combination. <br><br>HPs are decent, and Saves are, too, (bolstered by Crippling Strike, Evasion, Divine Wrath “Insurance,” and optimized UMD skills). In terms of defense, because the ranger’s dual-wield class restrictions require this character, when dual-wielding, to wear light armor, his/her AC may at first blush seem low; but this is well compensated for by the fact s/he not only has Crippling Strike (draining enemy strength), but also Cat’s, optimal UMD, and can moreover equip a tower board should s/he feel it necessary. Also, this character has a nice assortment of skills, including optimized stealth and listen; with UMD and traps, s/he can also deliver an exciting variety of different damage types (thus a bane to his/her enemies, indeed) ~ Tyr <br> <br><br>DIVINE RANGER (Knight of the Woods)<br>Champion of Torm(5), Ranger(25), Rogue(10)<br>Race: Human / Any Good (Theme: Chaotic Good)<br><br>I.

I can see a build like this being more effective getting rid of the Short Sword and AC, and focusing on high damage with a Greataxe or Scythe, since you have an abundance of feats. It would also do you more good to get rid of Called Shot in exchange for taking Knockdown, since you have a fairly good AB and you would likely break most Discipline checks. Other then that, a solid build.

interesting take.  a ranger with charisma just opens the RP options up.<br>i have been considering a build with these 3 classes for ages, but I wanted more CoT to boost saves and grab a few extra feats.<br>i wonder if the slight bonus from divine wrath is worth the loss in AC though.<br><br>again, a unique build from our local paladin of the even-handed. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>-cs
