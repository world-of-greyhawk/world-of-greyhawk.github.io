------This build is invincible.------<br><br>Yes it's a fact, this build is nigh invincible.

Most of these stats last for hours. A few last for at least 28 minutes. Only the bonus you get from "Aura of Vitality" last for less than 6 minutes.<br><br>AC is 86. Base AC is 32/ +Owl's Insight: 38/+Barkskin: 43/ +Aura of Vitality: 45/+Dragon form: 76/+Improved Expertise (you can always deal dmg with breath):86...Yup that's right, a NAKED AC OF 86! Knock off 2 points because Extended Aura of Vitality is only 5 minutes, that's still an naked AC of 84.<br><br>Your breath attack has a DC of 34 against reflex. It's deals 22d10 damage. This is only going to fail against opponents with evasion and high reflex saves; rogues and monks. Just claw them to death with your...<br><br>...+45/+42/+39/+36/+33 AB claws (note that your naked AC is 76 in this case), your claws do 2-16 + 25 (Critical: 19-20 / x2) in damage. And if you still keep missing them...<br><br>...You have 40/+6 damage reduction from your dragon form alone. The damage reduction from Premonition and Greater Stoneskin is not worthy of mention. Unless someone has a +6 weapon and above, attacks won't hurt you.<br><br>You have death ward against those pesky death spells. Your dragon form gives you immunities against mind spells, sneak attack, paralysis, and Fire/Electric/Acid damage depending on which dragon you turn into. You can also get freedom of movement from your druid spells, and true seeing from the dragon shape. You have blindfight against concealment. This doesn't cover everything...however...<br><br>...as a dragon you do have the saves Fortitude: 35/Reflex: 34/Will: 33 and that's without counting the bonus against spells you get from around 45 spellcraft or buffs.<br><br>You also can get 40 spell resistance from the "spell resistance" buff...<br><br>You also get a heck lot of hitpoints...they're always over 650...<br><br>You have all those druid spells at your disposal...<br><br>You're a dragon with knockdown...'nuff said<br><br>...and if you really need to be small, you can always fall back on the Rakshasa shape and toss maximized Ice Storms that do 66 AoE damage from a long range. Your AC is around 70 fully buffed with improved expertise on...<br><br><br>Again, the main selling point is that ridiculously high naked AC. <br><br><br><br>-------Now, here's the catch...-------<br><br>You're screwed if someone catches you in human form. Don't screw up.<br><br>I wish uncanny dodge could be here...cause like 44 points of that AC bonus is composed of Tumble + Dodge + Dexterity. Please be careful, and don't get caught flatfooted...<br><br>It's annoying how only armor fuses with dragon form...so your attack bonus is pretty muched capped at around 50ish unless you have a cleric or bard helping you out...<br><br>You have to rely on potions to heal or restore yourself in dragon form. No spells while morphed. <br><br>You're only going to benefit from armor in dragon form (although the Rakshasa form benefits from pretty much everything)<br><br>That dragon form gives +20 dodge AC, stuff that give dodge AC are redundant...<br><br>You can be KOed via devastating critical. Hopefully, that fortitude save and ridiculously high AC counter this risk.<br><br>You have no lockpicking and search, but heck you can bash stuff open and run right over traps!<br><br>You can't hide. But you don't really need to do you?<br><br>Maybe it's just me, but I don't think this build does enough damage...<br><br><br><br><br><br>------Carry this stuff, then you are truly and utterly invincible...--------<br><br><br>Armor with armor bonus and elemental damage resistance and HASTE!!! HASTE is most important here, you can do two dragon breaths every 6 seconds with haste! Regeneration is good if you're obsessed with keeping a full health bar at all times like me...you'd also do well with armor that has a "on hit cast spell" property.<br><br>Potions. Yeah, you could probably mow through armies naked, but if you meet up with 10 of your average lvl 40 epic characters, you're going to need potions to deal with them. But seriously, they're wasting their time if they're trying to kill you. With around 5 Heal potions and haste and some heavy armor with +5 armor bonus, I could take on EVERY EPIC CHARACTER AT ONCE from the Pretty Good Character Creator module...that's 22 lvl 40 characters...on D&amp;D hard core mode...I don't consider it an achievement because they're only NPCs, and NPCs are stupid. They don't run away and rarely heal each other for a start.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>So yeah, build this girl, go on a rampage, and please tell me what build is going to kill it. <br><br>PS: I have no access to multiplayer content, please note that this build has not been tried in PVP. It would be very kind if someone could tell me how this build fares in multiplayer.<br><br>PPS: This is my first post...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/04/09 18:03</span></i></p>

Oops<br><br>I have apparently stated that the crit range for dragon claws is 19-20. According to the build, there's no improved Critical: unarmed strike. You should choose this over Combat Casting.

LMAO!  I love the energy!  We will need a mod to go in and add character lvls to the build cuz it is alittle hard to follow as it is in this form (i DONT mean edit out the banter!  That is COOL!  Just add character lvl!)<br><br>btw, it doesnt take a rocket scientist to make a dragon invincible.  And at the same time, NOTHING is.  Being a marketer though, i gotta say i LOVE the energy you brought to a run of the mill build (28/10/2 is standard with druid shifters).

All the extra levels of druid and shifter do to dragon shape (besides buffs cast previously) is to improve the breath weapon.  The breath weapon deals either 22d10 fire, 22d8 electric, or 22d6 acid (The 23d10 the OP posted is a mistatement).  The save has a 34 DC, and the poison of the green dragon is a constant property DC 26, 2d6 constitution damage.

What builds would fare well against it? Actually, most other Dragons would. They'd IKD you in a heartbeat, but you can't do it back. And then you'd have no DR against them. And not enough AC while on your heiny.<br><br>Also, of my builds I'm pretty sure the Knight of Yore (with over 70 AB) would be very good against it, unless you can breathe him to death before he can connect a blow. Being hit with a Holy Avenger would eat your buffs faster and faster, and you'd be easily KDable. 40/+6 Dr will let you sit and enjoy the punishment a bit longer though. Why no discipline? You got Monk in there.

Oh man, your first post, you sure need to lower your ego, this is the epic character builder's guild, that means we're pros, and your dragon is nothing special.<br><br>Basics number one: there is no invincible build.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Yes it's a fact, this build is nigh invincible. Yes it's the infamous dragon build, <b>yet no one seems to be doing it right</b>...I'm seeing other people try so hard to get AC values of 60 and 79, whilst i'm easily getting a naked AC of 86.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>First of all, use the <a href="http://www.gustaver.se/nwn/" target="_blank">build  search engine</a> and look for Druid dragon builds. Once you've seen real builds come back and comment. If you're too blind I recommend you to see the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225446", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Order of Jormundgandr</a>, which, though it's an illegal build with version 1.69 that forces you to take more Druid levels for Dragon Shape than in earlier versions, it can be rearranged simply lowering a bit of Cleric for Druid and it loses close to nothing and it's still a dragon with over 80 AC and over 70 AB, so your build is like a kitten in front of that one.<br><br>Next, time for some education, since I'm pissed at you saying we don't make our dragons right. I guess you've never tried a dragon with Champion of Torm, let me tell you a hint: CoT gets Greater Wisdom as bonus feat. What does that mean? you can easily raise your base WIS to max and just with that I already made a dragon with higher AC than yours, tough luck kiddo. CoT also raise saves, and take a good look there, since any heavy arcane caster can destroy you there.<br><br>Now, the only curious thing about your build is that you take Improved Expertise whereas I always find my AC high enough without it. And take note that with Improved Expertise activated your AB collapses to a buffed +41 on your claw strike, which is not something you can brag about, the average meleer gets higher AB than that.<br><br>Now, you seem to love the shift but you're missing out like half the power you can really get out from a dragon build. Druids are spellcasters, and given you raise your WIS for Dragon Shape your spell DCs are also high, so not using your offensive spells only proves you've never fought in real time. Try and take a look at how enemies get devastated with a single Storm of Vengeance or Stonehold. The thing with Druids is that you can have high DC spells <b>and</b> a strong melee prescence via shifting. If you don't exploit both you will die much more often. <br><br>I bet you didn't notice dragons are immensely huge, if you rely solely on that any archer will snipe you to death easily because you can't enter narrow areas, or heck not even regular size corridors.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Your breath attack has a DC of 34 against reflex. It's deals 22d10 damage. This is only going to fail against opponents with evasion and high reflex saves; rogues and monks. </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>A DC of 34 is very crappy, this is going to fail easily half of the times you use it if not more. And somebody with evasion will laugh a whole turn of you sitting there and missing. With something as low as a save of 25 your chances of hitting through are already bad. And make numbers, 22d10 is only the fire breath, (the others have lower dices) which is also the most common element to have resistance against. A spell or your claws usually make higher damage per round.<br><br>Nothing personal against you. Overall the build is pretty nice, it's well done, but don't go around saying we don't make our builds right.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 10/04/09 17:28</span></i></p>

Well, that calculation was the main reason i took improved expertise.<br><br>Hmm...never looked at Champion of Torm...but I really needed those shifter levels for Rakshasa shape; otherwise archers would snipe it to death in the corridors (^_^;)<br><br>Yeah I guess it was wrong to say "no one seems to be doing it right", was high on my ego that day.<br><br>Thanks for the build search engine!<br><br><br><br><br>Magical Master:<br>Darn, i thought spell resistance of 40 was good. Then i looked at nwn.wikia...apparently any mostly pure spell caster can beat the spell resistance...<br><br>Grimnir77:<br>Darn, thought i listed discipline as an essential skill. As for IKD...does +4 KD check really mean that much difference?<br><br>Not sure what a knight of yore is, but 70 AB isn't going to hit this dragon :p, i mean, the AC goes to 95+ when I actually wear something, higher if a friendly cleric is around.

I don't care if it can't kill, just want a build that has less than .1% chance of dying in any fair to slightly imba situation (cause of course, 22 player controlled epic characters is going to kill anything). If there's such a build which isn't a dragon build, i'd love to hear it, cause at this point in time, i am satisfied with nothing but dragon builds. <br><br>Please continue bashing!

For example, the character sheet does not count for capped bonuses. Say, you're a dragon, which gets +20 Dodge AC, and every type of AC gets capped at +20, so when you Haste yourself the Character Sheet sums it up but if you check the feedback rolls, you're not really working with that AC. It's easier to notice buffing AB with a Cleric, since they get enough buffs to go over +20, the character sheet says your AB is higher than what it is in reality. Shapeshifting screws a lot the character sheet as well.<br><br>The thing about PvP is that there is this cool build called Exhalted Sorcerer which is basically a Sorcerer / Paladin / Monk which gets really good saves thanks to paladin and Evasion thanks to Monk, along with the best offensive caster around, so that build kills a lot in PvP. Once you fight an Exhalted Sorcerer that buffs himself with Epic Warding (man I hate that buff) and Epic Mage Armor you will know real pain. As Kail said, it's useless to compare every build in PvP, we would all end playing Exhalted Sorcerers if winning is the only goal, but knowing there's no invincible build is a start.<br><br>You can't just stand by AC. If you use Improved Expertise to get 90+ AC you won't hit an enemy with 60, so that's missing rolls on both parties, a battle of attrition, and face it, those are not fun. Your high HP is good in a battle of attrition but I believe you can still be easily defeated by a Dwarven Defender, his base DR will outmatch yours unless you're on a low-enough environment so that his weapon becomes useless. Many builds can get the "uber-high AC you can't hit" drill, in fact, I believe a Rogue / Wizard / Pale Master actually does it better thanks to Improved Invisibility and Epic Dodge which makes him conceal 50% and evade the first hit that lands every round, it's absolutely horrible to fight those guys in melee.<br><br>All around, dragons rock in low magical environments (typically +5 enhancement available or less), because enemies can't get weapons that breach the dragon's DR nor buff AB enough to hit you, so you own in melee fights. In high magical environments, (let's say +15 or higher) your advantage starts to drop because weapons get ridiculous damage bonuses and your claws haven't improved a bit.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 10/06/09 03:05</span></i></p>

Many builds can get the "uber-high AC you can't hit" drill, in fact, I believe a Rogue / Wizard / Pale Master actually does it better thanks to Improved Invisibility and Epic Dodge which makes him conceal 50% and evade the first hit that lands every round, it's absolutely horrible to fight those guys in melee.<br><br>All around, dragons rock in low magical environments (typically +5 enhancement available or less), because enemies can't get weapons that breach the dragon's DR nor buff AB enough to hit you, so you own in melee fights. In high magical environments, (let's say +15 or higher) your advantage starts to drop because weapons get ridiculous damage bonuses and your claws haven't improved a bit.<br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Thanks for the tip about character sheet!
