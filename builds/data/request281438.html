You could try Bard Shifter, take undead form for SPECTRE (not Risen) and put up your Extended Wounding Wispers.  Go in and spam Disarms (not Improved Disarm) to cause an AoO or two.  Sing/Curse/Taunt.  Spectre Invisible yourself, take weapon finness.

He doesn't want RDD/PM because he's not allowed to take RDD or PM; it requires DM permission.<br><br>Anyways, if you want high AB, I'd try some kind of Paladin Bard Fighter.  16 Paladin 20 Bard 4 Fighter would be very good, STR-based.  It could be DEX as well, but it gets no Epic Dodge, or Uncanny Dodge.<br><br>So, I'd try a 20 Bard 10 SD 10 Fighter of sorts, or maybe even 23 Bard 4 Ftr 13 Rogue (depends if you want Sneak Attacks, or HiPS).<br><br>Any Bard with Lasting Inspiration will be a good support character, but with Paladin levels for AB, or Epic Dodge for defense, it will be a good melee'er too.

Unfortunately, I'd have to say I don't think Bards would be all that good in PvP environment, unless it's extremely low magic. They just don't have the HPs and especially in a world that allows Dev Crit, they're gonna be quick toast, as Fort is their low save. By this I mean a character that's predominantly Bard. But I don't do PvP, so maybe you <i>can</i> build a good PvP Bard with no RDD or PM, but I'm unfortunately not the one to ask.<br><br>And what's up with needing DM permission to take PM levels when you've got Dev Crit nightmares running around willy-nilly? I mean, PM is your <i>only</i> means of guaranteeing you can't be one-shot killed, requiring you to burn at least 3 levels in SOR, WIZ or Bard, and also burning up 2 of your 3 class choices (for the caster class and the PM). And those Dev Critters, whom I'm willing to bet are running around with either kukris, rapiers, or scimitars, can basically spam you with insta-kill Fort saves ad nauseum. Nice rule on that server. Really.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Oh, c'mon now, Avado. Yeah, I do hear you, in terms of Endaylor's requests (and you're not being harsh, so far as, c'mon, let's face it, we like to think our builds are actually going to get played, yes? totally understand what you're saying, and excellent point I might add about the need to understand not only what one is playing, but also the weaknesses as to what you're up against, at least as it relates to PvP -- on the other hand, I built for Endaylor (if I may say, and as folks here know about me I am probably these days one of the most humble builders around, but at the same time, I do PvP, and I do know what it takes to win the battle - at the end of the day, discretion is the better part of valor, and frankly, I don't blame Endaylor for his requests (in fact, it really was fun: I've some old builds here, he happened to request a topic which be one of my own particular specialities, that of the fighting bard (and it's cool, gave Endaylor quite a few play tips too I might add -- I could go on about the dev.crit DC 49, etc. etc. etc. not to mention that we achieve it by level 24 (without I might add, as in zero, RDD and saves so high that frankly, don't need any PM either (just don't roll a 1, 'kay <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    <br><br>Frankly, I let my characters speak for themselves; when players have a question, or need to know how something works, they tend to ask -- and he gets it (ain't that right, Endaylor? And I thank him -- afterall, if it weren't for Endaylor's request, I wouldn't have achieved what I set out for Sling to be in the first place: that of a true (and I mean true) fighting bard! And as he said, he's playing it, and he gets it, and ... (OK, enough -- coz at the end of the day, as Avado says, it really about playing that which you yourself are comfortable with; that he gets, and I assure you that in turn, he too now loves them fighting bards <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Honestly, that humbles me that I helped him find what he ultimately wants (and at the end of the day, it was he who got me to tweak an old build of mine and together, we not only got him exactly what he wanted and feels great playing and comfortable with, but also what I wanted to build in the first place -- as in, a true FIGHTING BARD. So, yeah, thank you, Endaylor, I appreciate your request and high compliments (yeah, Sling now is that good as a result, he truly is, thanks to Endaylor's request else I never would have had reason to revisit that build): and really, from the bottom of my heart, built him for you, and so glad to hear you're enjoying him (coz in the end, ain't that all that matters?  <br><br>As many people here know, I am a law professor in real life, and truly enjoy NwN (been playing DND, well let's not get into it <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">       On the other hand, I enjoy these discussions, and for one appreciate the opportunity to update one of my builds --- I know a heck of a lot more than I did back then, and for sure also gave Endaylor play tipe. Maybe it's up to us to teach, yes? And when it comes to PvP, like you say my old friend, it's about finding what you like to play, and then sticking to it. <br><br>I highly recommend someone takes their build into a leveller/training mod (I personally enjoy Commche's uber magic world, insane DR enemies and the like, and put my own characters up against them with nothing but mundane equipment; then again, what do I know, I'm only the fighting bard professor <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">      <br><br>That's my point of view, and my opinion on the subject; and you make an excellent point, Avado --- you truly do; you I generally agree with most of what you have to say, and that, geez man, at the end of the day I love ya; on the other hand, it's up to us builders to be honest and let the players know what the heck is going on. You don't win battles imo in PvP b/c of what you got per se, but rather as to what the enemy is lacking, and you adjust for their strengths, so as to take advantage of all their weaknesses. This is nothing new, btw, and has nothing to do with versatility: it has to do with natural stats (in pvp, everything should assume they get morded, and that's a fact; and while some enjoy casters, others do melee, frankly, give me a fighting bard anyday -- I know how to play 'em, and never let me down to date; as Mith long ago taught me, if what you need to do is run around for a bit, then so be it. <br><br>Afterall, this is a game and at the end of the day, natural stats matter. Period. And while I like I.Samphus' build for PvM (too bad Endaylor can't take up his and my Pale Rider, the BG/PM/Bard --- yeah, Samphus, we did good on that one for sure, and thanks once again for talking me into a casting/singing bard <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">      But when it comes to PvP, I prefer and will always take the sword. End of story. One hit and be done with it I say; and end of story. Once again, Natural Stats Matter (and what in Odin's name might I add is gonna save vs. a DC 40 dev.crit (well, with how I tweaked the Sling, we will - and finally it seems, yes, and thanks to Endaylor who got me to relook at the fellow, and which I for one appreciate since he saves, others don't. That simple. pVp ISN'T about versatility -- it's about dev.critting (and with all his buffs, curse+song, if dexers are smart enough, they'll stay away is alls I be saying. Then again, when I first started to PvP, dare I admit, I ran up against a dwarven mage wall with the shield, thinking some high speed monk sr with low ab etc would do the trick --- boy, was I sorry <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">      Live and learn I say; and trust me, when it comes to PvP, my bards have never and I do mean never let me down (and thanks to Endaylor, and I mean it, since everyone these days in pvp are suddenly going neutral to avoid paladin smite (cheating, it truly is, so I build paladin Dev.critters now, smite is nice, but they wanna cheat that? Great, take this instead I say --- it's the nature of the beast, and we builders gotta keep up I say (afterall, what someone taught a law student back in say 1924 is about as relevant today as say oh, I don't know, 1.68 as it relates to divine power <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">      <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">      <br><br>Heck, no wonder Endaylor is confused --- he knows what he wants, but wants to "win" too (ain't that right, Endaylor --- and reason why we focussed here on a melee (as in fighting) bard <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     <br><br>On the other hand, and not gonna say I've the most bard combos goin' (coz I probably don't), but frankly and always I have preferred the fighting bard, period, and stand by my story. And having explained to our friend, Endaylor, who truly now understands the nature of the bard, and all their great stuff (as well as weaknesses - c'mon, not giving up all my secrets you know <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">       -- at the end of the day, he's better by far than most melee'rs period, and will truly (and I do mean truly) enjoy his fighting bard .... (he knows what to do, ain't that right, Endaylor? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">      )<br><br>As we say at the law school, some folks are future corpies, others litigators -- but on occasion, and it truly is a treat, I meet not only a future legislature (actually trained one, and that was plain neat!), but given time, a future supreme court justice. Those are the ones who ask the "hard questions" and see things that perhaps we didn't originally, and make us do better; if my builds inspire someone (and they obviously did) and that someone in turn asks great questions (wbich they in turn did), then I for one am happy to tweak it, to ensure it is appropriate and fits into their particular world. Afterall, as we also say in the law (whether clients like it or not, but I assure you, they get it a whole lot quicker than do our students -- with the exception of the good students that is, and Endaylor as it relates to build-making I must say, he fits into the "good student" wanna learn more and ask the hard questions of his professor, ... the law are dependent on the facts, meaning they turn on the specific situation in which you are playing. And in this case, what can I tells ya, he understands and has truly come to appreciate the wonders of the fighting bard! <br><br>(next week, you can teach him about the clerics, Avado; but in the meantime, stop stealing my coverts will you?

We should make a poll, what's more boring, TyrTemplar's long posts or Endalyor's stupid requests? just kidding, but that was a long boring post Deb.<br><br>I agree with avado though, your building won't improve until you start writing builds yourself, I used to play a lot my "cool builds" that I made on the march, I've always been a powerbuilder since I started playing RPGs so I wasn't too bad, but until you start writing down the builds and noticing your own mistakes your builds don't really improve, you repeat the same mistakes; Endalyor is depending too much on us, he just asks for builds and doesn't get feedback to his own building (because there is none to see).<br><br>I'd be glad to make feedback on a build by Endalyor, but building for him is losing whatever sense it had at some point.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/28/06 23:16:09 (GMT) -- Big Meph<br>Using the 2 ESF's in a dex based sneak build, <i>to me</i>, just looks like you're teasing your diabetic opponent with extra sugar on your whipcream covered chocolate mudcake.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Well, terribly sorry and didn't mean to bore, but really, I kinda felt that Endaylor here was being well, just felt the need to speak out (no problem, Thax -- and for the record, I for one enjoy his threads, including all his so-called silly questions, else wouldn't have bothered to pipe up <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">          <br><br>That said, AB is important always, and bard/cot/ftr have it (sure, could go ftr/bard/wm for more, but then, wouldn't be a lasting bard (and saves, well, let's not even go there <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">         <br><br>Really though, Nat AB 44, +2 Song: 46 Effective AB (Melee); (+GMW, War Cry, Curse, Emp.Bull's: 61, +6 Taunt: 67 add another +5 div.wrath, or 72 AB ; make that 75 AB with STR gear and self-buffs only. (BioCap: 70, +6 Taunt: 76 AB; bards also come w. self-haste, impr.invis., darkness and so forth. <br><br>And as also noted, incl. numerous times by Thax, in pvp everyone goes neutral, so pally smite and holy sword (vs. evil, and anyway short), doesn't really seem to me to be a good option, not to mention dispel woes. Totally up to him, though, as he's the one who must in the end feel comfortable. <br><br>Besides, at Dev.Crit DC 49, he's doing his share <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    There being no PMs (he said can't go RDD or PM (else, offensive wise, go Bard/Pal/RDD, or, if defense-oriented instead, PM/Bard w. either BG or RDD -- but that he can't do, and yeah, barring PM, everyone rolls a *1* - (so too do his enemies, right?), but otherwise his fort is high, and barring an auto fail, well, guess that's why they call it Roll-Play as opposed to Role-Play, but maybe that's just me, in which case, totally fine <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">          <br><br>anyway, said more than enough and already far too much; cheers everyone, and really, all the best: Tyr<br><br>** Edit -- hey, that is a good idea, Thax -- would love to see a build by Endaylor (yeah, really, that would be cool, and a jolly good idea, it is -- watcha say, Endaylor?

Sort of the same with AA. They just don't dish out enough damage to take a weapon master. I could maybe run around and shoot, but that would take ages, and by then they'll have a friend Bigby me or they'll catch up with haste eventually.  <br><br>The weapon masters seem most versitile. When it comes to WMs in PvP, it usually takes a weapon master to kill a weapon master. Anything less and you're down. A dexer WM will kick butt in PvP if built properly, but they just don't really do enough damage for PvM, where as a str based WM pretty much kicks *** in PvM aswell, especially when paired with a caster.<br><br>I want something different, without being different enough to get my arse handed to me. The bard Tyr built me is working out pretty well so far, you actually don't see people really using mords in PvP at my server, usually it's just blast you till you die. I'm just hoping with the bard I have, I'll be able to Bard Song, Curse Song, Haste,  taunt, and maybe Warcry before I get critted to death.

Good point Kail. One other route is a hideously high AC, which (assuming you can get it high enough) will also make you crit immune. Not sure if it's feasible without using PM though.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
