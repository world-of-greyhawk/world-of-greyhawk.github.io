With power attack active and dual wielding a heavy flail and a scimitar, this build has an AB of 41 and can do about an average of 256.5 damage per round, 466.5 against a favored enemy, if all hits connect and no criticals. With improved power attack active and dual wielding a heavy flail and a scimitar, this build has an AB of 36 and can do about an average of 291.5 damage per round, 571.5 against a favored enemy, if all hits connect and no criticals.<br><br>This build could be altered by reducing Man at Arms levels to 4 and increasing Ultimate Ranger levels to get more favored enemies. It could also be changed to 28 Ultimate Ranger/4 Man at Arms/8 Tempest, you'd lose weapon specialization but you'll get one more attack per round with perfect two weapon fighting.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Giantevilhead on 05/27/05 11:31</span></i></p>
