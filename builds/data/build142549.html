<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>I'm currently playing this one in the OC (finished Chapter 1 at 9th level) but may wait until 1.63 comes out, so I can progress past 12th level without an XP penalty.  Haven't really played upper levels yet, so I'm not sure what Druid spells would complement her well ( like buffer spells as a personal preference, but I'm open to ideas). ...and I forgot to write down dragon stats.  D'OH!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_redface.gif">    <br><br>Objective: An RDD that can actually transform herself into a red dragon... and slowly learn how to share the stories of her path along the way.  The character story begins with her studies of animals in nature. As she progresses, she finds dragon blood beats through her own heart, and journeys to a distant land.  There, she finds an ancient teacher who instructs her in the many ways of the Red Dragon.  Alas, she is called back home and continues her time in nature and sharing/teaching with others.  Suddenly, in the deepest moment of stillness she receives grace and becomes one with the beast in her dreams.  Her heart spirit, her true companion, the red dragon.  (OK, I just made all this up without proofreading it, but it's a start, right?)<br><br>Human<br><br>Druid 22<br>Bard 8<br>Red Dragon Disciple 10<br><br>Base AC: 23<br>AB with any non-exotic ranged weapon: +35/+30/+25<br><br>Abilities: Start (Finish)<br>STR: 10 (18)<br>DEX: 12 (12)<br>CON: 12 (14)<br>INT: 12 (14)<br>WIS: 16 (32)<br>CHA: 14 (16)<br><br>Skills:<br>Animal Empathy 43<br>Concentration 41<br>Lore 8<br>Perform 12<br>Persuade 41<br>Spellcraft 40<br>Tumble 40<br>Use Magic Device 37<br><br>Class taken for character levels:<br>Druid unless noted below<br>Bard levels: 3,7,12,17,22,27,32,37<br>RDD levels: 6,8-11,13-16,18<br><br>Feats:<br>1 - Luck Of Heros, Point Blank Shot<br>3 - Weapon Proficiency (Martial)<br>6 - Zen Archery<br>9 - Toughness<br>12 - Lightning Reflexes<br>15 - Improved Critical (Longbow)<br>18 - Called Shot<br>21,24,27,30,33,39 - Great Wisdom<br>36 - Dragon Shape<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 05/20/05 15:20</span></i></p>

Wait a minute. If I give up the last Great Wisdom (and the corresponding AB), I should be able to get the Dragon Knight Epic Spell.  Thus, the opponents would have two red dragons on their hands.  Hmmm... Anyone use this spell?  Are you a fan?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By sketchy_c on 07/21/04 20:27</span></i></p>

I don't remember which one that was... Anyway... if you use that in dragon form, you will get even higher AC.<br><br>But personally, I recommend that you use Hellball because dragon form can use that spell... I have used it in several of my dragon forms(even the ones that I have not released yet).<br><br>But those three epic spell feats are good. So you can try getting them all if you want. If you went that route, you will lose three epic feats that you want to use in order to get those three spells.<br><br>Anuis

...which would probably cost me Dragon Shape.  One Epic Spell is definitely a bonus.  Thanks for the feedback!
