Introduction:<br>"Stalkers serve as covert intelligence gatherers, comfortable in both wilderness and urban settings. They are the spies, informants, and interrogators, and their mastery of stealth makes them deadly opponents."<br> ~ the description for the Stalker kit in this game... Baldur's Gate II, ever heard?<br><br>Stalkers were (are) cool in BG2, and I wanted to try and get that Stalker feeling to NWN. In BG2 you got only 3 spells but I didn't want to limit my build to that <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">     The original Stalker kit was unable to wear any armor heavier than Studded Leather but this guy can wear Hide Armor without losing his Ranger abilities. Note, however, that Arcane Spell Failure does apply while wearing armor/shield. The BG2 backstab system was, as most of you probably know, different, using multipliers. You could reach x3 multiplier with a Stalker character - this build gets 5d6 sneaks, which is nice. As a Stalker you would get a 20% bonus to your stealth skills, but this I chose not to try and bring to the build. I decided to go for Initiative instead (could've gone for ESF: stealth skills) so you strike shiftly from the shadows <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br><b>Playable 1 - 40 PvM</b>  <br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Alignment: Chaotic Neutral (any alignment will do fine, really)<br><br>Attributes:<br><br>Starting<br>--------<br>Strength     16<br>Dexterity    14<br>Constitution 14<br>Intelligence 15<br>Wisdom       8<br>Charisma     8<br><br>Ending<br>------<br>Strength     30<br>Dexterity    14<br>Constitution 14<br>Intelligence 16<br>Wisdom       8<br>Charisma     8<br><br>Levels:<br><br>Guide<br>-----<br><br>1.

I am glad that a lot of people still like to play a good ranger.  Warms my heart, it does.  Now then, to the build...<br><br>I would recommend dropping some rogue levels and increasing the ranger levels.  The best reason for losing the sneak die is the gain in how much earlier you could get BoE, and you would get possibly 3 more FEs.  that is not something that i think should be lightly considered.  also in my version in my head, i would only take 4 rogue levels pre-epic to preserve a bit of AB.  not much can be done about the wizard part though.  delaying any more wizard just leaves you empty for spells in pre-epic.<br><br>on a side note, what spells would you see as being most beneficial to this build.  i know what ranger spells would work, but what wizard spells would be of the most value?<br><br>I am wondering how you make the best use of Hide Armour with a dex of 14 and no empower spell feat.  i assume you hope for a good roll or something?  or just some dex boosting equipment?  i just thought that with a wizard multiclass one might want to consider a metamagic feat or two, although it is far from necessary (and probably only of marginal usefullness).<br><br>i have never played BG2 (gasp!) but i will have to look into it.  i like this idea of the stalker.  if i canthink of something good, i might make my own stalker-type build.<br><br>since AC isn't great, i thikn that Epic prowess and Armour Skin have a very good counter argument to the GS's.  also, by leaving rogue at 4 in pre-epic you don't lower the ab.  a similar argument can be made for picking up great con instead of great str.  but that's just me liking me rangers with a little more heft.  also gives a little boost to fort save.<br><br>also, i think that the version with a wiz level towards the end is worth it. it helps to boost saves, and its easy to implement.<br><br>i like the idea behind this build, but without seeing what wizard brings to the build i can't help but see what it takes away:  Ranger spells, ranger levels = FEs and earlier BoE, More Rogue.  UMD doesn't seem to be very important since a single wiz level automatically qualifies you to read any scroll.  i dunno.  i just know that i have tried ranger/wizards before, and the result was poor.  maybe i just went about it wrong.<br><br>also, as a suggestion, you could take assassin instead of rogue to help with XP penalty.  represents the darker side of the stalkers' life, perhaps?<br><br>well, as with anything i say, take it with a grain of salt.  except the following:  Rangers rock.<br><br>Well done.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>“If you bring a Ranger with you, it is well to pay attention to him...”<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By christian.schnabel on 11/28/05 23:28</span></i></p>

In BG2, you picked just one racial enemy - hence, you should be grateful for having five in this here build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;christian.schnabel<br>that is not something that i think should be lightly considered. also in my version in my head, i would only take 4 rogue levels pre-epic to preserve a bit of AB. not much can be done about the wizard part though. delaying any more wizard just leaves you empty for spells in pre-epic.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Sure, it's possible to go with a different level spread in pre-epic, but I did what I did to get a more balanced entity who looked like himself in pre-epic too. Many builds tend to go like say Fighter 10/CoT 10 pre-epic and then shoot up 20 Rogue in epic. While this is by all means playable and receives high BAB than a version which takes Rogue in pre-epic, it's - in my opinion - less fun to play. But yeah, you were thinking... Ranger 12/Rogue 4/Wizard 4 in pre-epic for 27 BAB? Ranger 14/Rogue 4/Wizard 2 for 28 BAB?<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;christian.schnabel<br>on a side note, what spells would you see as being most beneficial to this build. i know what ranger spells would work, but what wizard spells would be of the most value?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Ah, the spells. Haste, Stoneskin, Lesser Spell Mantle, Lesser Mind Blank, Cat's Grace, Bull's Strength, Endurance, Darkness, Ultravision, True Strike, Keen Edge, <b>(Improved) Invisibility</b>, Identify, Protection from Alignment, Mage Armor, Lesser Spell Breach for other spellswords and Bigby's Interposing Hand if they don't have SR come to mind ;D<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;christian.schnabel<br>i have never played BG2 (gasp!) but i will have to look into it. i like this idea of the stalker. if i canthink of something good, i might make my own stalker-type build.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->You have to buy BG2 this instant! Check here for the BG2 classes and subclasses: <a href="http://dw.com.com/redir?asid=258273&amp;astid=8&amp;siteid=19&amp;edid=107&amp;destCat=9853&amp;destURL=http%3A%2F%2Fdb.gamefaqs.com%2Fcomputer%2Fdoswin%2Ffile%2Fbaldurs_gate_ii_class.txt" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;christian.schnabel<br>since AC isn't great, i thikn that Epic prowess and Armour Skin have a very good counter argument to the GS's. also, by leaving rogue at 4 in pre-epic you don't lower the ab. a similar argument can be made for picking up great con instead of great str. but that's just me liking me rangers with a little more heft. also gives a little boost to fort save.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Yeah, I thought about that too. Now, after a good night's sleep, I might even drop all the Great Strengths and boost my defences. Epic Prowess and Armor Skin, different pre-epic spread for more AB and two Great Constitutions or Dexterities, how does that sound? The drawback would be a mere +8 damage in main and +4 in offhand <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;christian.schnabel<br>i like the idea behind this build, but without seeing what wizard brings to the build i can't help but see what it takes away: Ranger spells, ranger levels = FEs and earlier BoE, More Rogue. UMD doesn't seem to be very important since a single wiz level automatically qualifies you to read any scroll. i dunno. i just know that i have tried ranger/wizards before, and the result was poor. maybe i just went about it wrong.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->As said, scrolls aren't the only advantage of UMD. With UMD, you can pick up items only usable by other classes and probably enhance your abilities more than a build with no UMD who has to submit to these restrictions <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  But yeah, in my opinion five Favoured Enemies is plenty, and Bane of Enemies isn't the only thing about Rangers <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Arcane spells are, in my eyes, superior to the Ranger ones. You also have to distribute less attribute points since Intelligence is a must have anyway ;D And there's the RP value.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;christian.schnabel<br>also, as a suggestion, you could take assassin instead of rogue to help with XP penalty. represents the darker side of the stalkers' life, perhaps?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->Kail answered this too (thanks), but I'll say it again: Rogue is just superior. The XP penalty isn't bad with this build, yes?<br><br>Thanks, you brought up alot of points.

If I were playing this from the ground up, I'd probably only take WIZ to 8 and rush more quickly to Ranger 21 ending at 22 for a final skill dump, WIZ 8 for a final spellcraft dump. 7 will allow you level 4 spells, not sure how useful level 5 ones are. Mightn't be the most powerful way to cut it but ah well.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

So, you'd recommend finishing with 27 BAB and 28 Strength? That'd make... 40 AB, 38 dual-wielding. Ok, sounds good <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Sure, dispel takes all the cool powers from any spellsword type (though this isn't that much a spellsword, just a Ranger with spells. Or something <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> ). That's just the way it works <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  Oh and I was just testing a Paladin heavy boss, whose weapon had Holy Avenger - stripped all my buffs straight away. Almosted bursted to tears, I did.<br><br>I do see the usefulness of Armor Skin, but in the first version I was trying to go with full offense. As such, you would have to rely on preparing and planning your fights beforehand. Maybe it's better to try and balance it a little bit, however. Obviously this guy will never be a tank, though <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>Good point about the ranger spells there. Nevertheless your arcane casting includes the invisibility line of spells as well as Darkness, which is very good for generating sneak attacks.<br><br>Maybe I'll build one more version later.
