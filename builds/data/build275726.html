The second installment in my short series of Dexterity based Paladin builds is quite different from the first.  This build is meant to kill pretty much anything that moves.  It has an effective 76ab (for a short duration, with Taunt and Divine Wrath), Holy Sword, Epic Dodge, UMD, very high saves, Epic Traps, and can deal out a ton of damage for a Dex build.  High listen and modal detect cancel hipsers, while 7d6 sneaks add some extra wallop to your attacks.  Be prepared for an angry backlash of tells, as you will frustrate people with this build in PvP &amp;#61514; <br><br>Also, with your stout saves and Holy Sword, you have little to fear from mages.

Flame Weapon scrolls.  Improved Invisibility scrolls.  Pretty much any scroll that helps, really.  Cast Holy Sword, knock stuff down, and hit it until its dead… repeat as necessary.  Lay a few traps to lure opponents into in case you need to flee.  Taunt your opponent… then Taunt them a second time!!!  Save Divine Wrath for the when you really need it.  Stock Power Word scrolls for runners, and away you go!<br><br>Notes:  Why Elf?  High Dexterity and Modal Detect.  Why Hand Axe?  Better critical multiplier (on my PW, crits around 130ish).  Why Expertise?  Boost your AC by 5… and still have an AB of 60!  Why Taunt?  WHY NOT!?!?  Paladins combine not only some of the best AB buffs with excellent BAB progression, AND they can Taunt opponents to lower their AC.  All in all, a deadly combination.<br><br><br>Other builds with similar class split I found on search engine:<br><br>The Seraphic Edge (Rogue 16 / Paladin 8 / Champion of Torm 16)<br>-- Big Meph<br>Tarnished Paladin (Paladin 16 / Rogue 16 / Champion of Torm <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"> <br>-- Caithdein na Briona<br>Halfling Vindicator (Rogue 16 / Paladin 6 / Champion of Torm 18)<br>-- FinneousPJ<br>Knight Of The Quest (Paladin 26 / Champion of Torm 10 / Rogue 4)<br>-- grizzled_dwarflord<br>Avenging Champion Commando (Rogue 17 / Paladin 15 / Champion of Torm <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif"> <br>-- Ithacan<br>Avenging Champion Commando v. 3 (Rogue 13 / Paladin 17 / Champion of Torm 10)<br>-- Ithacan<br>Avenging Commando with Elf Ears (Rogue 13 / Paladin 17 / Champion of Torm 10)<br>-- Ithacan<br>The Strongarm of the Law (Paladin 15 / Champion of Torm 24 / Rogue 1)<br>-- Markus Tarek<br>The Generalist V2 (Champion of Torm 14 / Paladin 16 / Rogue 10)<br>-- Mithdradates<br><br>Medieval Scout (Rogue 17 / Paladin 17 / Champion of Torm 6)<br>-- TyrTemplar<br><br><br>Many of these are similar, and some are really great builds.  Cheers to Ithacan, as this is pretty much a Dex based version of his Str based Avenging Commando, which flat-out rocks, and is similar to his Dex version, but makes a few sacrifices for higher Dex, and some different feat selections.

Hmm, I'd drop 2 DEX for 4 more CON and 2 more CHA.  CoT's bonus saves counts towards the +20 cap, so I don't see how you plan on getting stellar saves with 8 CHA.  I'd prefer 80 HPs and +1 to all saves (+3 to fortitude) over 1 AB and 1 AC at any time.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By mantis3 on 06/06/07 19:02</span></i></p>

I just did a test build with those adjusted ability scores, and I think I like the results better.  Guess that's why submit these builds in the first place, eh?
