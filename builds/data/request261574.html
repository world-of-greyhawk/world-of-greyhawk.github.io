You can't get it all, especially if the 46 DC has to be the base DC (no STR enhancement computed in).<br><br>RDD requires Bard or Sorcerer to be accessible.<br><br>620ish AB? You mean HPs I guess...<br><br>46 DC on Dev crit requires 42 STR. If you want the 46 DC to be natural (before STR buffs through items) then you'll be needing RDD. <br><br>FTR/Bard/RDD looks like the safest bet. You'll need the feats FTR brings. FTR 14/Bard 16/RDD 10 (FTR 4/Bard 8/RDD 8 preepic, or FTR 2/Bard 8/RDD 10 if you wanna exploit divine power scrolls). You'll still fall short on Disarm/Imp Disarm (unless you sacrifice other IMO essential feats for it), HPs total, SAs and skillpoints. Tell me if you wanna see such a build.<br><br><br>You can try with a Rogue/Bard/RDD, HPs will be even lower and you'll suffer from feat starvation.<br><br><br>Bard/RDD/WM is feat starved big time, I'd stay clear of it.<br><br><br>If the Dev Crit DC (46) can be reached via STR enhancements, the task gets easier (since you'll not need to spend most of your epic feats on Great STR).<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Heavy metal<br>Or no metal at all<br>Whimps and posers<br>Leave the hall!

Heh heh, you never asked Kail; how is your magical setting peterwiltshire1? it would be nice to know what level of magic weapons and armor you have there.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;62 AB??? Do you realize how high is that?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>He knows what he wants, it's a better request than the usual "high AB".<br><br>He does asks for too much, there are some other ways to get the AB than only RDD-STR path, even a higher AB, but your Dev crit DC is going down. I'm still not sure why you say you need such a dev crit DC if you admit there is an accesible Crit-immune helm, it's the best property I know of on a helm, I use that helm on every server it is available, so dev crit would effectively end quite useless (well, on PvP, PvM would still rock).<br><br>Decent sneak attack is not going to happen with such a high AB/Dev crit DC, you need to save all your feats for Great STR, and still get dev crit, you'd have to replace Fighter for Rogue in that matter, your BAB goes down, important lack of feats, not much sneaking skills, etc. If you want a good sneaker, you'd go better with a Rogue/Cleric/Shadowdancer, that will give you a high AB and sneak, but you might as well forget about Dev crit, or try to get it with a minimum DC (although buffable), still, Epic Dodge is generally a better option than Dev crit when dealing with sneakers.<br><br>That's a nice one Kail.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 12/25/06 17:41</span></i></p>
