I tried to cast the epic spell "Pious Parley", and all I get is a messege saying that my character is faithless.  This was odd because this character was a cleric, and I put in a deity name during character creation.<br><br>Is there something I'm missing here, or is the conversation intentionally left that way so dm's can add their own conversation with deities?

This is a PW question?  The PRC is very large and unbalanced.  For those reasons, most PW's will be selective in what they allow.  This also means that they can alter spells to fit their needs.  Just cuz you used a cleric may not mean you can cast the spell.  It could be an alignment thing.  It could be the spell is not configured for the PW.  Honestly, who knows better than the DM's on that PW.   Sorry we cant help more.

Second, this isn't for a PW, I was just testing a few ambiguously described epic spells in the PRC.
