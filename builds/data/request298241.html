Thought this might be a fun request<br><br>Looking for the following:<br>Half Orc<br>Good/Neutral Aligned<br>Halberd User<br>Half Decent AC or reliable Dmge Reduction<br>Level 40<br><br>No Cleric Wiz Sorc Druid RDD PM or Bard<br><br>Medium Magic World (+5 Equipment at the best)<br><br>Mostly for PvM but some PvP. Alot of the monsters are sneak immune so sneak HO is out (although a 7foot tall ninja is a fear provoking thought)<br><br><br><br>And.......GO!

Huh, +5 magical environment and you don't want Cleric or Druid? well... your choice.<br><br>Aside from the class restriction and no sneaks, I don't see much here, what is it you want, precisely? to use a Halberd you only need Weapon Proficiency Martial, so any Barbarian, Ranger, Fighter, Paladin and Weapon Master (which is what looks you want) has it already, done.<br><br>I wouldn't play a non sneak and non magic DEX based Halberd user, makes no sense if you ask me. So don't expect a high AC and take a lot of STR, better take the DR way out.<br><br>So you want DR? there's only two "high DR" routes, for good DR go Barbarian with EDR and for great DR go Dwarven Defender with EDR, since no Dwarven Defender has managed to be Half-Orc, that one is out already. That's what happens when you don't like Dwarves, all the best DR goes to hell. If you really want Damage Reduction with a Half-Orc take a Barbarian 36 / Fighter 4 build, that ends with 18/- and has the chance to grab EWS.<br><br>Oh well, there are a few options that are valid, for instance, I think a Ranger 21 / Barbarian 19 is a very nice build, you take EDR III and Bane of Enemies, it's a high damage build which ends with DR 12/-. Paladin 20 / Barbarian 20 works too, you get Holy Sword and Divine Might, along with a few buffs to AB and CHA. Another good option can be Fighter 8 / Weapon Master 7 / Barbarian 25, that gets a better critical hit to your Halberd.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 06/27/08 22:22</span></i></p>

Paladin is required to be Lawful, and Barbarian is forbidden to be Lawful, so they don't mix very well.<br><br>You could go Fighter 12 / Weapon Master 28. The 2 epic levels of Fighter gives you EWS, and the 28 levels of WM gives you awesome criticals, and +7 AB. This build would rely on the equipment for AC, but would deal out damage like a champ. Dev Crit is a possiblity.<br><br>You could go Fighter 4 / Barbarian 36. This gets you 9/- damage reduction without diverting points from STR to CON. Time the 4th level of Fighter right, and get WS and EWS at the same time. You can wear heavy armor with no penalty, and Dev Crit is a possibility again.<br><br>Make it Fighter 10 / Barbarian 23 / Weapon Master 7, and you still have 5/- damage reduction and better criticals.<br>_________________<br>Great Research Tools:<br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWNWiki</a><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">NWN Epic Character Build Search Engine</a><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/" target="_blank">The NWN Vault</a>

Fighter / Rogue / Champion of Torm? I'm sure it's a nice build with tons of feats and Epic Dodge, but what's so special about taking Champion of Torm on a build that already has Fighter? he wasn't asking for high saves, Weapon Master makes more sense to improve power IMO.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

You can't really go wrong with it. The fact he was not asking for high saves is not a good reason not to give him high saves. High saves are never bad.

Heh, I'd never figured you playing standard all around builds. You're right though, it's a good default class choice that gets a lot of useful stuff: saves, skills, BAB, ED, tons of feats... I just think that when you marked "Nuff said" it sounded like a super porwerbuild that overthrows everything else, but it doesn't. I'm more into focused powerbuilds than all-around builds.<br><br>I'd like to hear a reply from the OP, rambling like this eventually becomes fruitless to the purpose of the topic.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 05/09/08 07:26 (GMT) -- avado<br><br>THax, you know i love and respect you, right?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

He doesn't ask for high saves, true. But he doesn't ask for high crits either.
