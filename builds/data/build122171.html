I've never built a character as far as level 40 yet, because I've not been playing that long yet, and I haven't had that much time for it, but after some failed builds I started something like this one now.<br><br>My idea was to take paladin levels instead of fighter levels, because paladins have some feats (Divine Might and Divine Shield) that use the high charisma aswell.<br><br>I was planning on making it a Sorcerer20/RDD15/Paladin5 character and putting all points in charisma instead of strength to benefit as much as possible from Divine Might/Shield. <br><br>I'm still busy developing this character though, so I can't give any build descriptions yet. But I plan on posting it as soon as I have a decent built <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .<br><br>Meanwhile let me know what you think of my paladin version, I probably can use some tips on DO's and DONT's <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .
