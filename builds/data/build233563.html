Interesting build. Reminds me of one I have in my vault which I've never posted. It's a CLC-based build that uses a club as well. I called him the Exploited Cudgel.<br><br>Anyhow, the only thing that worries me on first glance at the build is the low CON. I'd move 6 points from STR into CON at creation (lower STR to 16 and raise CON to 14). It would only cost you 1 AB and damage and would result in 120 more HPs.<br>_________________<br>Captain's Log, Stardate 6051: had trouble sleeping last night... my hiatal hernia is acting up.

Finn, did you forget ambidexterity and TWF or am I becoming short sighted?<br><br>As for the rest, I second Grimm's suggestion and share his opinion. You are gonna need those HPs.

Well, my thought was that the build's a one-trick pony: you make a huge DA and if that doesn't work, this build doesn't work <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  . This is why I thought one more AB/damage is more important than HP. TBH, if you're taking damage you're already dead. That's only my opinion, of course.<br><br>Kail's right :| I messed up the feats when I wrote that (there are also two KDs there now) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  Well it was late <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>Here's the proper version<br><br>1.

This build is easy to kill unless it is at lvl 40. You have no dicipline, at least not enough. Builds with small HP and low fortitude are gonna be toast in seconds, but a build like a Sword/shield FTR/WM would kill you because of his high AB and of course IKD. And again I'm trying to figure out why you took STR over DEX.<br>_________________<br>Be realistic...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kalmar_Oxin on 03/16/06 12:45</span></i></p>

Well I have played alot of Arena servers, and Disc is the most important skill of all! If a char uses Ikd against a char with 0 disc skill points... you are going to be knocked every single time he hits you, after your first 2 attacks, which by the way can make around 70 dmg on  each hit?<br>_________________<br>Be realistic...

Actually, he'll do more than 70 each on the first 2 hits.  Assuming the victim makes his save against the death attack, he'll suffer 24-30 base damage from each hit(I won't factor criticals, though it certainly is a possibility).  Add in weapon enhancements, strength enhancements and elemental enhancements.  Then factor in 44d6 sneak, plus 2 crippling strike blows that will drop the victims Str by 4 and AB by 2.  <br><br>I'd say that first shot is going to be quite devastating.  And while hitpoints may be low, he still has an undispellable-lasts-forever Improved Invis.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

I also like to hit KD &amp; CS on my first attacks. KD means death, CS: Arm lowers your attack, CS: Leg your AC and movement speed - just enough for me to slip behind a corner and hit Stealth, or cast Invis. There's also Darkness, and traps... Like I said, it's obvious this build won't be better than a WM in toe-to-toe melee, that's just stupid. You're supposed to use your brains. I'm sorry if my build doesn't fit your playing style, but stop whining and telling it's bad because you don't understand how to play it.<br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm

I have PvP'ed quite some. If you think a fighter/WM is the better of a Halfling assasin, let me show you otherwise. Darkness alone would save his day, he can just enter into it and stealth right back on. Yeah, the fighter can run, but never hide <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   . My sig fits perfectly for this fella. Stick and move. let him hit your trap, hide behind a corner, strike two. Enter Darkness, hide, wait for DA and strike three. You can loose. But you can also easily win. And like Cinn wisely said, it doesn't say PvP, but played right it can be used for that too.
