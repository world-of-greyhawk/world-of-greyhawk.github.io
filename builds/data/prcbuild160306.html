Deep in the mountains lies a secluded city of Avariel (winged elves).  The select group of guardians known as "Faenya's Wardens" serve to protect the surrounding countryside, keeping it free of dangerous creatures, looking for signs of undesired travelers, and always searching for evidence of their most hated adversaries; dragons.<br><br>19/9/12 UltRanger/ManAtArms/Tempest<br>Race:  Avariel  (+4 Dex +2 Int + 2 Wis -2 Con)<br><br>Str 13<br>Dex 22 (32)<br>Con 10<br>Int 13<br>Wisdom 12<br>Cha 8<br><br>Ability Summary<br>-----------------------<br>- WFocus, ImpCrit in 4 weapons; 3 dual-wielded (all dex-based); Longbow, Rapier, Mace, Kukri<br>- 30BAB combined with massive number of attacks; up to 12, thanks largely to Perfect 2-Wpn Fighting.<br>- 4 Favored Enemies<br>- High damage due via Power Attack due to ManAtArms Focussed Strike and Ult Rangers Favored Power Attack. <br>- 3d6 sneak  (Ult Rangers ability feat)<br>- HIPS (Ult Rangers ability feat)<br>- Improved Knockdown, Great Cleave<br> <br>1 UltRanger  WFinesse, WF(Longbow)<br>2 UltRanger  Favored Enemy (Undead)<br>3 UltRanger Pow Attack<br>4 UltRanger  Dex+1  WF(Mace)<br>5 UltRanger<br>6 UltRanger WF(Rapier)<br>7 UltRanger Exotic Prof, Favored Enemy(Constructs)<br>8 UltRanger Dex+1<br>9 UltRanger WF(kukri)<br>10 ManAtArms<br>11 ManAtArms<br>12 ManAtArms Dex+1 Ambidexterity<br>13 ManAtArms<br>14 ManAtArms<br>15 ManAtArms  TwoWeapFighting<br>16 UltRanger     Dex+1<br>17 UltRanger     Abi-HIPS,   Dodge<br>18 ManAtArms  Mobility, (SpringAttack, from class)<br>19 Tempest       (Imp 2-wpn Fighting from class)<br>20 Tempest   Dex+1<br>21 Tempest     Cleave<br>22 Tempest<br>23 Tempest<br>24 Tempest Dex+1(28)   Knockdown<br>25 Tempest<br>26 Tempest  <br>27 Tempest  Imp Knockdown<br>28 Tempest Dex(29)<br>29 ManAtArms<br>30 UltRanger Great Cleave, Fav(Outsiders)<br>31 Tempest<br>32  Tempest Dex(30) Perfect 2-wpn Fighting<br>33 Ult Ranger Imp Favored Enemy<br>34 UltRanger    Abi-SneakAttack +3d6<br>35 Ult Ranger  Epic Prowess<br>36 Ult Ranger   Dex(31) Improved Power Attack  (could also be BlindFight, Armor Skin, Called Shot, Blinding Speed)<br>37 Ult Ranger Abi - FavEnemy(Dragon)   Abi-Hawk Totem<br>38 ManAtArms (max Tumble) <br>39 Ult Ranger  Armor Skin<br>40 Ult Ranger  Dex(32) Favored Power Attack<br><br><br>AC 36 naked dual-wield <br>AC 33 single-wield without shield <br>(AC seems to flucuate even more than this; PRC quirk?)<br><br>AB 46/41/36/31   single-wielding<br>AB 45/40/35/30   longbow<br>AB 42/37/32/27 dual-wielding<br><br>Attacks/Round<br>---------------------<br>As I understand it, it can be as high as 12 attacks/round.<br>+4 main-hand<br>+1 Haste  (can cast himself using "Hawk Totem" feat)<br>+1 Furious Assult<br>+6 Perfect 2pn fighting (gets as many off-hand attacks as main hand)<br>----<br>So, 12 with everything, 10 with only haste, 8 just dual-wielding<br><br><br>Normal Damage (with Kukris; could be Rapier, Mace)<br>-------------<br>d4 +1 (str) + 3d6 sneak + DC 18 Con Drain<br>+ 3 (legendary prowess, general specialization0<br>+ 7 vs Constructs, Dragons, Outsiders, Undead<br><br>Kick in Power Attack-5, and it goes to:<br>---------------<br>d4 +1 (str)  + 3d6 sneak + DC 18 Con Drain<br>+ 3 (legendary prowess, general specialization0<br>+10 (focussed strike; 2xPowAttack Bonus)<br>+ 12 vs Constructs, Dragons, Outsiders, Undead<br><br>Kick in Power Attack-10, and it goes to:<br>---------------<br>d4 +1 (str)  + 3d6 sneak + DC 18 Con Drain<br>+ 3 (legendary prowess, general specialization0<br>+20 (focussed strike; 2xPowAttack Bonus)<br>+ 17 vs Constructs, Dragons, Outsiders, Undead<br><br>Saves<br>--------<br>Fort: 25<br>Relfex: 33<br>Will: 18<br><br>Skills<br>--------<br>Discipline 43 (44)<br>Hide 19 (30)<br>Jump 15 (16)<br>Listen 14(15)<br>Move Silent (19 (30)<br>Search 14 (15)<br>Spot 9 (10)<br>Tumble 40<br><br>Variations on the Theme<br>-----------------------------------<br><br>21/9/10 UltRanger/ManAtArms/Tempest  (no changes in build before level 30)<br><br>Gains an extra Favored Enemy, and Bane of Enemies (2d6 magic damage vs favored enemies)<br>Loses Perfect 2-Wpn Fighting (lowers max attacks to <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_cool.gif">  <br><br>21/7/12 UltRanger/ManAtArms/Tempest  <br><br>Gains an extra Favored Enemy, and Bane of Enemies (2d6 magic damage vs favored enemies)<br>Loses Legendary Prowess (lowers AB and damage by 2)<br>Loses Furious Assault (lowers max attacsk by 2, to 10)<br>Loses some AC due to minimal Tumble, unless you massively rearrange build.<br><br><br>Build Comments  <br>------------------------<br>- PRC Oddity:  At character level 21, Perfect 2-Wpn Fighting was available?  I was barely into Tempest levels. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>- Strong, flexible build, melee-wise. <br><br>- A little weak on Will saves, not quite as many skill points as I would have liked.  Could use some spells too, but I guess you cant have everything. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>- I gave 2 points to Wisdom thinking there might be some spells with Ultimate Ranger, but it turns out there arent any.  So this build can probably be optimized some more (2 to Con, or Str, maybe).<br>_________________<br>Normal kids play rock-paper-scissors.<br>Shifter kids play IronGolem-RustMonster-MindFlayer. . .<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By xitooner on 10/21/04 03:44</span></i></p>
