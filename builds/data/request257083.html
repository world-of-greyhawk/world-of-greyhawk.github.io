Hey there. I was looking at the builds on the search index and could not find quite what I was looking for. I need a str based bard palemaster weaponmaster with as much AB as possible while still factoring in devcrit, epic mage armor and a character who uses a 2-handed weapon. I was hoping for either a halfling wielding a dwarven waraxe or a human wielding a scythe. I wanted to ask the creme of the building crop if such a thing were possible.

Let's assume 16 for the bonus feat.<br><br>The best AB possible means no PM before epic levels, and taking WM as soon as possible. Ideally, this means Bard 12/WM 8 by level 20 for a BAB of +17. However, Exotic Weapons throws a wrench into this, which bumps your first available WM level to level 16 (due to needing 7 feats to qualify, which takes you until level 15 to get them all). So, you'll have to go with Bard 15/WM 5 by level 20, for a BAB of +16. Best you can do.<br><br>This leaves only 4 levels in epic. I suggest 2 more WM and 2 Bard. You can use the Bard levels for skill dumps.<br><br>Okay, epic levels needs Over Crit, Dev Crit, EMA, and you'll be wanting EWF and Epic Prowess to maximize AB. Assuming the Bard 17/PM 16/WM 7 template, that gives you 9 epic feats. 2 are PM bonus feats, of which one is a 'throwaway' Energy Resistance feat. 4 are EWF, Over Crit, Dev Crit, and Epic Prowess. 3 left, which you'll have to use for Cleave, GRT Cleave, and one left over (GRT STR?)<br><br>So, here's how you'd be forced to take your feats in pre-epic:<br><br>first 7 must be Dodge, Mobility, Exotic Weapons, Weapon Focus, Exopertise, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack (not necessarily in that order, but pretty close).

That means no spells beyond level 1, which is highly lamentable. However, you can still pump Perform and get a decent Bard Song. You could start with 16 STR and 14 CHA, which will allow you to still get Dev Crit, but you'd have a leftover ability point. However, you could probably drop GRT STR I and take Armor Skin, ending with 26 STR. But, your AB would drop by 1 point to +39. As it stands, your AB isn't all that great anyway.<br><br>Well, this will give you a starting point. Perhaps someone else can tweak it to make it more suitable.

IMO, there is no point spending 6 feats (dodge, mobility, weapon focus, expertise, spring attack, whirlwind attack) to get Weapon Master levels if you are going to have less than 19 WM levels.<br><br>It is an easy mistake to think that just by having WM levels that you will have a high AB, and thus combining with Pale Mastery you will have an Uber, High AC, High AB, crit immune killing machine!

Going Bard14/PM10/WM16 would possibly be better, and not necessarily cost a feat. the exotic weapon isn't really a downside, since otherwise he'd have to spend it on martial-weapon to get a decent one. Dev-Crit with scythe isn't the best choice either, as the crit-range is the lowest in NwN. <br><br>If he really, really wants EW, then Bard17/WM7/PM16 seems the best choice to me. But like Cinn says, low choice in spells, crappy dev-Crit DC (helped by bard song) and very little feats, not room for want-to-haves like KD, BF, curse-song, lingering song, heavy armor, more spells and still-spell. I'm prety sure this list could go on even a little longer. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

For a feat starved WM who wants to use a two hander and only has "free" access to simple weapons, the spear really isn't a bad choice.  Base damage becomes sort of irrelevant when enough magical and Strength bonuses are factored in, lowering average damage per hit by just a point or two.  Also, you get the prestige of being the only one on your PW who wields a spear.<br><br>Considering the lack of feats, being a human with a spear seems an obvious choice.<br>_________________<br>(I enjoy writing parenthetically (a lot)).

The x4 crit on a scythe was further improved by the WM levels to x5 and the threat widened to what, 17-20 with keen? That combined with a unshielded high AC and crit immunity could make for a nasty tank. The possibility to go nearly as effective with a spear is tempting, but at the cost of major style points of toting around "the reaper". I already started building this, but with far less strength and a 14 in charisma; 2 things I will likely regret in the build's future. Thanks for working the tall order guys. It's always a pleasure using this forum as a sounding board.
