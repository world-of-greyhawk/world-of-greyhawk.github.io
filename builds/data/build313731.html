It's pretty nice but I think Weapon Proficiency: Mace is not a very useful feat. You will melee with kamas or use your bow, which gets such a better AB you could even forget the melee. So, I suggest you drop WF and grab Blind-Fight.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Thax is right, WF mace is a waste of time, use WF morningstar instead.

It was NOT melee focused, no more than this one.  The cleric IS a melee caster.

May not kill fast enough, but a combination of high spell DCs, the ability to utilise nearly any combination of gear, and the fact its playable at nearly all magic levels. <br>Also, unlike you, I play in PWs where it doesn't really matter how good your character is, healing will be required. So high wisdom caster clerics can be good with healing. This toon IS focused a lot more on spells than the average joe cleric.<br><br>Also, <br><br>AB (max, naked): 25 (melee), 39 (ranged. 14+25 = 39.<br><br>I gave all AB after that with all buffs. To be honest, you're more likely to only us round/level ones at the shortest, and so have 5 less AB than a stated due to the loss of divine favour. Playing in melee is perfectly feasible, and this build is not born at 40. Implosion/SoV/HoTG etc. can supply much needed spells, and given you still have 39 DC will save Hammer of The Gods. This is a party build. Not an *I can solo every monster in the damn book* build. He also enjoy the second most spells per day of any build IIRC.

sorry bud.  Yeah, high dcs are nice. I built a PRC divine dude with an implode of 56 or something ridiculous (which is impossible on nwn vanilla).  I've been there, done that to the extreme, and literally made and wear the tshirt.
