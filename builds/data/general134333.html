Hey, I usually do builds for low-magic worlds, but I've stumbled upon a high-magic one with a big PvP influence.  Dev crit is still inabled, anyone have a suggested build?  It's hard for me to tell which would be good for high-magic just by looking through them x_x.<br><br>Thanks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Try to make a build that will give you abilities that you can't get from items.  Like PM for immune to crits, or HIPS unless there are perma true seeing items.  Some builds like DwD are less effective since everyone is probally doing massive damage.  If you get decent equipment then you will want a build to give you that little edge in AC, or AB for melee.  So RDD for the extra str, or WM for the AB can be very important.  Also full plate/tower shield builds that maximise ac, get tumble extra can be more effective on a high magic server.  <br><br>You could try a Bard 23/PM 10/WM 7 build.  Go for a scimitar, full shield, tower shield and auto still spell 3.  Max UMD, tumble, disc.  Save the PM levels for 20-30, try and take as many WM levels as possible pre epic.  Get immune to knockdown items, perma haste, perma true seeing items.  Boost your disc so you can't be disarmed and make sure to max your ac(use monk boots for that little edge).  Buff yourself with scrolls and bard spells, but don't get more that 14 chr.  Start with something like.<br>str 16<br>dex 13<br>con 12<br>int 13<br>wis 8<br>chr 14<br>Important spells are prot from align, mage armor, imp inv(50% conceal), darkness and ultra vision.  Those give you benefits that probally won't be countered, or accessible with items.  Also get some gr strs and get dev crit.  Obviously you want to pump your con/str to bring up your hp/ab.<br>Alternately go for 16 bard/10 PM/14 COT and that will give you better saves and allow you to put those dex/int points into str and con.  You'll also get a lot more feats.  Your crits will be less often but I think I'd actually prefer it.<br>Something like<br>str 17<br>dex 8<br>con 14<br>int 13<br>wis 8<br>chr 14<br>Hmm you'll have to grab exotic weapon proficiency since both these would require weapon focus, so maybe bastard sword or dw waraxe would be a good choice.  Either way it's more important to find good items than anything else on a high magic server.

evo_dragon,<br>You mentioned auto still - according to the manual, a prereq for that feat is the ability to cast lvl9 spells that bards dont get.
