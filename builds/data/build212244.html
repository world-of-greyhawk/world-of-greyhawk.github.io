<b>The Assassin King</b><br>Fighter14/ Shadowdancer1/ Assassin25<br><br><b>Playable from level 1 - 40 PvP &amp; PvM</b><br><br>What would you say if you could have an Assassin with a 37 Death Attack DC, 78d6 sneaks per Round, a 30 Strength, Hide in Plain Sight while wearing Full Plate, Weapon/Epic Weapon Specialization, Improved Knockdown and Improved Two Weapon Fighting, Improved Invisiblity, a high discipline, can cast from scrolls, 400+hit points, and has the best Initiative in the game?<br><br><br>The following is an excerpt taken from the <i>Chronicles of Cenelak: A History of Kingdoms</i> by Maximillian Cree<br><br>In the twilight years of the Kingdom of Cenelak, between the Galdonian Invasions and the rise of the Drow Lords to the North, there was orphaned a child who grew from nothing to a master of fates and the shaker of kingdoms .  He arose from the streets, from the slums and gritty quarters, among the brothels and seedy taverns, amidst the vagabonds and charlatans and artful dodgers and hardened criminals.  Whether it was by chance or accident that this boy was discovered by Cenelak's then Warrior King, none now can say, but there are those who say that nothing is by accident...and that all things happen for a reason. Smitten by the boy's earnestness and sincerity, and sympathetic for his plight, the Warrior King, against the advice of his council, adopted the child.  The Warrior-King was childless, and this boy fatherless, thus an uncanny bond developed between them.  And as the boy grew into manhood, he was trained by the best captains in the martial arts of war and combat.  His masters were impressed by his skill, for there were none among his age group who were as quick, or as bright, or as capable.  <br><br>He arose quickly among the ranks of the soldiery, and was popular among the poor for his "street heritage."  His honor and courtesy were unmatched, and by the age of 21 he was granted knighthood by his foster father, the Warrior King, and their love for one another was as strong as any bloodbound kin.  And through this bond, the peasantry of Cenelak became very devoted to their King, and he was known as the Benefactor among the populace.<br><br>But the King had grown old, and his alliances thin, and dark clouds festered on the horizon.  With no heir-apparent, the landed nobles and robber-barons began marshalling their forces in anticipation of what was to come.  For many of these nobles would never allow a slum-born bastard whelp to ascend the throne of Cenelak, and with the conquesting Empire of Galadon encroaching upon their borders, something had to be done.<br><br>And so it was on the eve of the King's birthday, he had taken ill and had retired to his private chambers, while in the feast hall below the gentry of Cenelak celebrated themselves and their King's health.  But there were some who only feigned the celebration, for they knew this would be the King's final hour, and they only pretended to drink the wine while they looked to one another with knowing glances.  Outside the city, the silhouettes of spears and helms gathered in the darkness.<br><br>The boy, who was now a man and a Captain, sensed something wrong.  Whether it was because of his foster-father's sudden illness, or the blades he thought he saw in the smiles of the barons, he knew not, but he left the feast hall to visit the ailing King.<br><br>He found his liege reclining in his chair, with his crown upon his brow and the fabled Sword of Cenelak drawn and resting upon his lap.<br><br>"My lord, you should be resting!" he began.  "Your fever--"<br><br>"Quiet, my child." and with his careworn face and luminous blue eyes, he looked upon the orphan, the child, his son, that he rescued from the streets years ago.<br><br>"My Lord?"<br><br>"This is the hour, my son.  This is the hour in which power passes to you.  I have given you my love, my wisdom, my experience, in the hope that someday you could lead our people against the greatest enemy we have yet to face."<br><br>"My Lord, your fever is making you speak nonsense.  Come to bed."<br><br>"Yes, son.  But look at this sword.  Does it not shine? Is it not keen?  Is it not deadly?"<br><br>"Yes, milord, it is all of these things."<br><br>"And would you agree that it is the essence of power?"<br><br>"Yes, milord.  It is through the blade that you rose to power."<br><br>"Indeed, but I was misled.  It is not the blade that gives us power, but this--" and he clutched his heart, "--this-- this! that gives us--" the King's eyes suddenly opened wide.<br><br>And he watched the color drain from the King's face, and blood spurt through the fingers from where he clutched his heart.  And then through the fingers and blood emerged the point of a slender blade green with corrosive ichor from which hissed a foul smoke.  And from the very air materialized a figure cloaked in the night itself.<br><br>And the King slumped to the floor.  And the cloaked figure approached him, and he thought to draw his sword but was too late.  The man was aleady behind him and he felt a pinch in his back and something warm, blood perhaps, slide down his body.<br><br>And a voice whispered fiercely, "This is power!"<br><br>"Who are you?"<br><br>"<i>I</i>...I am your father."<br><br>And so it was that the Assassin finished his mission, and the King was dead, and the Barons seized the city, and a period of unrest ensued in the kingdom of Cenelak.  It was discovered that the King's murderer was none other than the King's own Spymaster, who had secretly moonlighted as the head of a large Assassin network known as the Dark Stalkers, and that it was he who was responsible for the overthrow of the King, and who, through fear and dark allegiances, placed himself at the head of the Kingdom.<br><br> But notes found in a servant's journal indicate that the foster son did not die, but was left for dead, and that he was taken by loyal followers to a place hidden in the Slums of Cenelak, and there recovered from his dire wounds.  What became of him after is not known, but other sources indicate that the nobles of Cenelak began to disappear, one by one, in the dead of night.  At first it was feared that the Spymaster-turned-King had betrayed them, and that he was removing all potential enemies.  Yet this theory was proven wrong on a cold Winter's eve that marked the 10th anniversary of the Warrior King's passing.  Of this incident, the most compelling tale comes from a guard within the palace itself.  In a report he had written, he mentioned standing guard outside His Majesty's door one moment, and in the next moment a "stygian blackness" fell about him, and he vaguely remembered "something hard" hit his head.  And then,<br><br><i>I woke up, and thought for a moment that I was in bed and just had a dream, but I felt cold stone pressing against my face, and heard the sound of voices coming from within milord's chamber.  I tried to get up, but my legs were numb!  So I crawled to the door, and pushed on it.  Fortunately, it was ajar, and I could just see inside.  I couldn't see anybody's faces, but I saw two sets of legs-- one belonging to our King, and one wrapped in the stuff of shadows!<br><br>"I see that I have been deceived.  But what brings thee back? Vengeance? Speak quickly, my son, for thy breaths are numbered."<br><br>And then the shadowed figure threw back his head and laughed and said, "Why Father, your impatience reveals your trepidation!  I have come to teach thee a lesson you may have forgotten--" and then his voice grew grave, "--we reap what we sew, Father, and now is your hour of harvest, for all your fruits are ripened!"<br><br>And in that instant there was a clash of shadows, and I can only describe it as if two dark storm winds swirled and raged with a speed my eye could not follow.  But when the storm subsided, there only remained one figure, and he, my Lord King, lay lifeless on the floor.  Of the other I could see nothing, but for a moment I felt something pass over my body, like a soft breeze, and that's all I remember.</i><br><br>And so Cenelak plunged once again into unrest, and the Drow Lords began their Northern advances on the the Kingdom, and Galadonians invaded from the West, and it seemed that Cenelak would surely fall.  But a hero emerged, a fearless warrior who was once thought dead, the Warrior King's foster son, and through sheer strength and determination and key assassinations, he united the divided Cenelak, and restored peace and prosperity to the land, and brokered alliances with the Dwarves of the Krimesans, and against the Drow invaders he personally led a counter-assault so fierce and merciless that they still shudder today when his name is mentioned.  <br><br>To those fell denizens of the Underdark, they know of him only as The Assassin King.<br>______<br><br><br>Classes: <b>Fighter14 /Shadowdancer1 /Assassin25</b><br>Race: Human, (in theory, you can use all races, no xp pen)<br>Alignment: Any Evil, <br>Playable: 1-40, PvM<br><br><b>Attributes</b><br>Str16(30)<br>Int14<br>Wis8<br>Dex15<br>Con14<br>Chr8<br><br><b>Level Guide</b><br>1 Fighter1, Dodge, Mobility, Blooded<br>2 Fighter2, Knockdown<br>3 Fighter3, Weapon Focus: Shortswords<br>4 Fighter4, WS: Shortswords, Str17<br>5 Fighter5<br>6 Fighter6, TWF, Ambidexterity<br>7 Fighter7<br>8 Fighter8, Blindfighting, Str18<br>9 Fighter9, Improved TWF<br>10 Fighter10, Improved Knockdown<br>11 Fighter11<br>12 Fighter12, Improved Criticals, Toughness, Str19<br>13 Fighter13, (crossclass Hide/Move Silently 8 )  <br>14 Assassin1<br>15 Assassin2, Stealthy, (Ghostly Visage)<br>16 Assassin3, Str20<br>17 Assassin4<br>18 Assassin5, Improved Initiative, (Darkness)<br>19 Assassin6<br>20 Assassin7, Str21, (Invisibility)<br>21 Shadowdancer1, Epic WF, (HiPS)<br>22 Assassin8,<br>23 Assassin9, (Improved Invis)<br>24 Assassin10, Great Str I, Str23<br>25 Assassin11<br>26 Assassin12<br>27 Assassin13, Great Str II<br>28 Assassin14, ESF: Move Silently, Str25<br>29 Assassin15<br>30 Assassin16, Great Str III<br>31 Assassin17<br>32 Assassin18, ESF: Hide, Str27<br>33 Assassin19, Great Str IV<br>34 Assassin20<br>35 Assassin21<br>36 Assassin22, Armor Skin, Superior Initiative, Str29<br>37 Assassin23<br>38 Assassin24<br>39 Fighter14, Epic Prowess, Epic Wpn Spec<br>40 Assassin25, Str30<br>______<br><br><b>Combat Vitals</b><br>AB: 42/37/32/27<br>Dualwielding: 40/35/30/25/40/35<br>Naked AC: 23<br>Full Plate &amp; Shield: 33<br>Stealth in Full Plate: 49<br>Initiative Bonus: +16<br>Death Attack: 37<br>Sneak Attack: 13d6 (78d6 per Round)<br>Hit Points: 408<br>Skill Points: 269<br>______<br><br><b>Saves</b><br>Fort: 22<br>Reflex: 21<br>Will: 15<br>______<br><br><b>Skills:</b> <br>Discipline: 42(52)*<br>Hide: 43 (57)<br>Move Silently: 43(57)<br>Tumble: 40<br>UMD: 31(30)<br>Set Traps: 10<br>Spot: 36(37)<br>Disable Traps: 17<br>Open Locks: 1<br>Heal: 1<br>Search: 5<br>______<br><b>Skill Distribution</b><br>1 Disc4, Heal1, Bank15<br>2 Disc5, Bank19<br>3 Disc6, Bank23<br>4 Disc7, Bank27<br>5 Disc8, Bank31<br>6 Disc9, Bank35<br>7 Disc10, Bank39<br>8 Disc11.

Grrrrreat, Grizz. A new STR assassin. But how can he be the assassin king with no Dwarf??? Hm, well. A dwarf would not need toughness you know. Or be able to raise his dex by 1 point. Would hamper saves by losing blooded though. Oh well. You've got me convinced of the greatness of STR assassins. EWS would be nice to get earlier, for even more playability. Possible?

Know this is one of the best builds I've seen for an Assassin. Great concept and good potential for a killing machine on many servers. <br><br>My idea would to lose 2 assassin levels to attain more playability throughout epic levels and replace those with 2 fighter levels. This will grant 1 more epic feat at the loss of 2 death attack DCs. The feat is placed whereever you would need it, but thus it only makes the build more playable due to the fact discpline will be at the same point until level 39 with this character.<br>_________________<br>Be realistic...

Thank you all for the feedback.  Just when I thought the best builds of my life were behind me....<br><br>A few notes:<br><br>1. <!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 09/11/05 20:15:02 (GMT) -- Kalmar_Oxin<br><br>My idea would to lose 2 assassin levels to attain more playability throughout epic levels and replace those with 2 fighter levels.

If you play your characters like me, you typically run them aground between Lvls 28-35 (or even sooner).  If this is your case, or you play in an environment that caps you long before Lvl40, then I would advise taking that Fighter14 much earlier.  If you cap at Lvl 24, 28 or 30, then taking that last level anywhere around there is okay.  You really wouldn't need to take more fighter levels though, for you're only talking the difference of a few Discipline points and, being Strength-based, his Discipline will still be pretty decent.  Further, every loss of Assassin Level dilutes his greatest weapon, the Death Attack.  It really is imperative to jack this as high as you can get it.  <br><br>2. Regarding skills:  due to his Strength-based nature, Set Traps probably won't be a real needed skill like it would be for a Dex-variant.  Instead of devoting resources to that skill, I would max out Spot (or Listen if your prefer), since one of the Assassin's greatest fears and weaknesses is another assassin/sneak.<br><br>3. Dex variant: Kaliban posted a nice version of this character in Dex form (and elf, yech!).  It provides some good perspective.  I would really like to play it Dex-based myself, but if I can't get Epic Dodge, I tend to go Strength-based.  I figure if I can't dodge that first blow, I might as well dish out as much punishment as possible.  <br><br>Cheers<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

However, one of the goals of this build is to have the maximum possible boost to Initiative, considering the stat parameters (i.e. a STR build). This is to ensure as much damage possible from the sneak/death attack in the first flurry (as well as maximizing the chance to have the Death Attack fire).<br><br>The other thing to bear in mind is, since this is a STR build - and taking weapon enhancements and elemental damages into consideration - the difference between 1d6 and 1d8 base damage is basically nil.<br><br>*edit* And the other consideration is style: tough to picture a stealthy Assassin carrying around a big old Two-bladed Sword.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 09/12/05 15:57</span></i></p>

Ok, first...  THANK YOU!<br>You have no idea how many times I have looked at your Deathstrike build thinking: You know, that is really nice, BUT...<br>Has no Defense.  No E. Dodge, Has I. Invis, but that doesn't match SCV.  That is hard for me get past.  If it had Epic Damage resistance or something, maybe...  But I just see the deathstrike geting raped with muitiple attackers.  I know...dont get in that situation, but "Best laid plans..."  <br><br>The Big advantage of Deathstrike is that when a normal assassin is screwed (sneak immune/damage resistance) Deathstrike is still hitting hard to make up for it.<br><br>Now this one has HiPS.  Duh! That solves my biggest complaint.  And really, while I tend to think the world revolves around E. Dodge, in a gangrape situation it isnt helping that much, its the SCV that dominates. But HiPS and withdraw...  I like it.  Still gonna have probs against Mobs with TS, but there is no perfect answer.<br><br>Couple of questions:<br>1) You made the comment on Deathstrike: "Taking 2 Rogue levels gives him the Evasion he needs".  Why doesnt this guy need it?  Because its too costly to fit another level of SD?  (-1DC, -1 sneak or -1 feat and Disc dump or -1BAB)<br><br>2) What would you lose by taking SD earlier besides 1BAB?

In fact, there are enough feats that you can really change anything you want and customize to your particular environment.<br><br>Also, I think Cin covered everything regarding this question, but there is one more reason, and this is perhaps most important:  if you choose to focus in a 2-sider, fine.  But what I find is that when faced in situations where you need both more AB and more AC, the 2-sider is screwed.  The above character can dual at 40 AB, but if things are getting hairy, he can boost both his AB by 2 and his AC by 3 just by switching to a tower shield that's been quickslotted.  A 2-sider can do this, but he's not going to have the feats invested into a second WF/EWF, so while his AC will go up, his AB will remain the same.  Thus my reason for shortswords (or maces if you prefer).<br><br>Note, however, that I am not making an argument against Exotic, for I think it's a great feat and works extremely well in tandem with UMD.  It truly allows you to use just about anything you come across.  That, and I've always been partial to kukris due to their looks.  However, my big problem with Kukris (and this addresses another comment), is that I have had little luck in finding good ones.  Such is the price we pay for cool factor...<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 09/13/05 01:34:33 (GMT) -- Unforgettableknight<br><br>Couple of questions:<br>1.

I'm not sure if I have a solid answer for you other than, "37DA DC is prettty damn important."  I've done a bit of testing with quite a few Assassin builds.  I can say with some measure of assurety that 20Assassin levels are not enough if you want to reliably count on DA working.  I know 30Assassin is the best in the business.  I think 25 Assassin is kind of the line in the sand if you want to make an Assassin that really works.  An unmodified 37 will give him a 35% chance to land a successful DA on an opponent with a 30 Fort.  Those are pretty good odds, all things considered.  And also, he's only really going to get two actual Death Attack strikes-- the first and second attack within the intitial flurry.  Everything after that will not trigger the Death Attack saving throw check.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp; 2. What would you lose by taking SD earlier besides 1BAB?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->  That's a biggie, especially since he needs as much AB as he can muster to insure landing his death attacks.  Also, he won't be relying on sneak damage for a few levels anyway.  Honestly, for all intents and purposes, he's just an old-fashioned fighter up until level 14.  His stealth skills won't be that great pre-epic since he still might be compensating for plate or whatever armor he's wearing.  This would make HiPS a futile effort.  But he does reach a point wear his skills start to make up for the armor, and then you're in the clear.<br><br>Appreciate the feedback, the comments and questions.  Also, Unforgettable Knight, I think it was wise of you to draw comparisons to the Deathstroke build, as it reveals some of the inherent weaknesses of a pure PrC build.

Just out of curiousity, why did you take that fighter level so late? I would think you could take it soon after 20 to get EWS much earlier in your carreer. You would push down 1d6 sneak attack to a level higher than you currently have it, but would have a consistant 2 damage per attack for many more levels. It's a close call, but that consistant damage might be useful against sneak immune enemies. The call is 2 pts vs. all opponents against 3.5 average vs. opponents vulnerable to sneak. I myself would go for the consistant damage. If there are skill reasons or something else I am overlooking please let me know.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Very Nice build.  I played something similar on a PW and it was a hoot.  I used rogue instead of assassin, half orc and scythe.  The idea was to have that massive guy come out of nowhere with full armor and a scythe and smack you with sneak attack and/or massive crit <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> <br><br>Nice!<br><br><br>Drallimer

Small weapons give you the least dual-wield penalty (-2/-2). Anything larger in the offhand will give you an extra -2 penalty when dual-wielded.<br>_________________<br>Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream...

If you can't take SD, take 1 level of Rogue for a skill dump into Hide/MS to qualify for Assassin. Gains you about 18 skillpoints, adds 1d6 of sneak damage. Ranger would let you not crossclass and gain 1 AB, but no extra sneak damage and 4 fewer skillpoints saved.<br><br>TM
