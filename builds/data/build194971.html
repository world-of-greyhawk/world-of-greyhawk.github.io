<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br><br>Hello,<br><br>I'm brand new in the guild. I propose here one of my favorite characters. It is an Elf Cleric/Wizard with a bit of Champion of Torm. He is a master of Arcans and magics, and fight quite well.<br>Historically, he is a Pen&amp;Paper character who was extremely interested by magic, and who accumulated a lot of magical power and objects.

You should definitely change wizard to sorcerer (INT-&gt;CHA) - the synergy with both cleric and COT would benefit greatly from that.<br><br>I would also change another bit:<br><br>Lower DEX to 8 and raise STR to 14.<br><br>Replace Called Shot and one other feat (Imp crit or quicken spell) with Power Attack and Divine Might.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By MartinJHolm on 05/14/05 08:23</span></i></p>

But yeah, from a purely strength of character perspective, you certainly get a lot of nice benefits using a charisma based caster multiclassed to cleric.  Frankly, I would switch to human and then you can switch to sorcerer without any XP penalty.  This build really isn't dependent in any way on the elf bonuses.  You can easily get the same stats with a human, plus an extra skill point per level and an extra feat.

You're right. I went wizard for roleplay reasons, the main one being the number of extra skills thanks to the great intelligence (more than 150 skill points more!). The same for Elf... This character was in fact the survivor of some kind of a madly suicidal and group, and he had to compensate their lack of perspectives by learning to do nearly everything...<br><br>But it is true that a great power improvement come from the sorceror class. In that case, you have still have to choose between 18 or 19 level of sorcerer, and by being a human, you still have a possibility to have a good amount of skill points. It is also true that Divine Might would be good with a high charisma... But I thing that Quicken Spell is worth it, and it is better to leave Blind Fight when you have lots of spells to help you.<br><br>In fact, I was also wondering what to do to make him even more generalist (when being limited to 3 classes) with for example Rogue skills (of course, if you take a pixie as a familiar, you probably won't need it...), without losing the 4 per round attacks. If you have an idea...

If you adjust your leveling around a bit, you can take Sorcerer and avoid an XP penalty until the final 2 levels.<br>_________________<br>Homer: Lisa, would you like a donut? <br>Lisa: No thanks. Do you have any fruit? <br>Homer: This has purple in it. Purple is a fruit.

How is it possible if I want to keep the 4 attacks per round and have the automatic quicken and still spells ?
