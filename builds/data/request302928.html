Hello All,<br><br>The server I run on allows only Druid / Shifter builds to have access to the greater shapes: undead, constructs, outsider, and dragon. Adding a third class will cancel these shapes. Its mainly a PvM with some PvP. I am trying to find a build that would keep me alive and be fun to run, the server is also a med magic one. I tried the search engine but cannot find anything that I could modify to fit this purpose. Is there someone out there that can build this? I know I cannot. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

Well, if you can't take a third class I recommend to taking most of your levels on Druid first, in order to get all the buffs and some combat spells fast, as well as a strong animal companion. Keep Shifter to the minimum required for the shapes you want.<br><br>Other than that, there's not much to work on, boost mostly Wisdom to attain the dragon shape, take spellcasting feats: I recommend spell penetration and focus on conjuration (mostly because I like Storm of Vengeance, great spell) or Evocation (most Druid combat spells are Evocation).<br><br>I'm not sure if you'd like my build, but I would play a 39 Druid / 1 Shifter assuming 1 level of shifter is enough to take Dragon Shape (if not, then I'd take the minimum required) and make it a caster build, since the Druid alone has pretty decent shifts IMO.<br><br>You say you can't build it yourself, but what is it you need? building isn't hard.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 11/06/08 03:30</span></i></p>

Take the first 20 lvls in druid . At lvl 5 you have acess to the bear form which is the most powerfull at that lvl. Then at 12 you get the improved bear form , dire bear.Till 16 lvl when you can shift into an elemental.And at 20 lvl the improved elemental forms. The forms will be powerfull enough with all your buffs to keep you alive hopefully. You can take weapon finesse at some time near 12 or 15 lvl so you can use a better ab as an air or water elemental. <br><br>At epic lvls you can take from 21 to 37 shifter.This way you will get almost all the forms a shifter can get plus the improved humanoid forms from shifter lvl 17. The last 3 lvls can be druid but is not  much of a difference. <br>Also dont forget to put most of your stats into wisdom so you can get dragon shape early on . If you have 30 wisdom near 32 lvl (you should start with 18 wis and put all stats increase into wisdom and 2 feats of great wisdom) you can get dragon shape at 33 .<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TasMagar on 11/06/08 08:14</span></i></p>
