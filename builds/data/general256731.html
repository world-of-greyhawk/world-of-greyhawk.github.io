Yes, an epic level parry build.  After some consideration it actually does not seem that horrible, despite the stupid Bioware issue of only blocking three attacks a round.  The key seems to be Epic Dodge.<br><br>So, our average fighter type is going to have 5 attacks at epic levels, 4 from BAB, 1 from haste.  +0/-5/-10/-15/+0, when we break it into rounds, that means the first round is +0/-5, the second is -10/-15, and the third is just +0<br><br>So, assuming we parry the attacks we can (with a +17 from three feats (SF, Imp Parry, ESF) not to mention the possible bonus from having bard and dex in this build, it seems likely we might), we're left with -5 the first round and -15 the second.  With epic dodge, we avoid the -5 even if it lands, so on average for any given round we only have to avoid the -15.  Throw in concealment and things just look nicer.<br><br>There is a fair problem in actually dealing any damage when you do get a reposte.  With a Bard/RDD/Fighter you can get WS/EWS for +6 and +8 STR for +4 as well as the bard song for another +3, but that's really all I seem to be able to dig up.  Assuming we start with a 14 STR and use a greatsword, Doing 2d6+18 a hit isn't horrible, but it's definately going to make things take a while.<br><br>So, um...  Thoughts?

Parry is a Dex based skill, so I think having a higher dex (and not str) would be better for your chance of survival.<br><br>If you have a Finesse Weapon you'll benefit more on the reposts attacks.  At Epic levels it's more about the ability to hit rather than the damage dealt.  (for PvP)<br><br>Also, Parry is a one on one event, if you have more than one attacker... your days are numbered... and it's a low number at that.<br><br>But I do like the Parry concept paired with Epic Dodge.<br><br>I wonder how the mechanics work on that.  Do you parry first or just dodge the first blow.  That would make a big difference.

So, I guess you'd have to be able to parry a dex weapon master build...  What's the AB on one of those?<br><br>30BAB<br>20 Dex + 10 levels + 6 Great Dexes = 36 Dex<br>Weapon Focus / Epic Weapon Focus / Epic Prowess (+4)<br>Superior WF +7<br><br>+57 AB<br><br>So to always parry you'd need a 77 parry check...<br>43 from ranks<br>+17 Epic Skill Focus / Skill Focus / Improved Parry<br><br>Which means you would need to get 16 from somewhere else.  Having a 26 dex (for epic dodge) would mean you'd ahve at least +8 already, so +8 and the last +8 could come from an item or if they are in short supply, a 20th level bard's song.

I tried using parry in an epic WM dex build, actually, and even with a parry check in the 70s found that I took less damage over time by fighting normally and killing things faster.  <br><br>Parrying only has much value, IMO, in a party that's using a dex tank.  Dex tanks don't usually do that much damage anyway, but they can have high parry checks, so you can often use parry to reduce the incoming damage to the tank while the party kills things.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Parry builds just don't work imo. "The best defense is a good offense." holds true for me.

If you are up agaist a Dev Crit person, then Parry is VERY usefull.<br><br>Of course, if you are Dev Crit as well, then it might make for a quick battle too.
