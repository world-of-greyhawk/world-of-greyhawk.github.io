<b>Playable from level 1 – 40 …PvM</b><br><br>Last week, I posted a shady character that I named ”the Ghost”. If you read the story, you’ll remember he killed a knight in the cemetery. Now, I want to bring some balance to the equation and offer a new holy warrior that won’t panic when facing such “creatures”.<br><br>I have tried to make a build that is balanced between Cha and Str. The extremely Cha based knights, like the epic build “Divine Warrior” <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_divinewarrior.html" target="_blank">Click Here</a> have impressive saves and divine might/shield/wrath. But they lack in AB and carrying capacity: (A character with Str 14 is encumbered above 116 pounds. The basic equipment including full plate and tower shield weighs more than 80 pounds, so there is little room for bringing captured armours and weapons back to the church.) <br>It is also important to have enough paladin levels to get all the spells. They are worth it!<br>I wanted to give the character some Str, and as much as possible of it early on. But I still wanted a high enough Cha to make the divine feats an attraction.<br>I landed on Str 20 and Cha 26 as a good balance. A paladin build with Str 30 has +5AB/damage compared to a Str 20 build. But the paladin has enough ways to improve the AB and damage to make a Str 20 build both viable and fun to play. He can also buff the Cha to make the divine feats really juicy (from +8 up to a +12 bonus).<br>The class mix gives 10 bonus feats. I need that to get basic and epic combat feats, divine feats and enough Great stats feats. <br><br><b>Guardian of Light</b><br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Alignment: LG<br><br>Attributes:<br>STR: 15 (20)<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 14<br>INT: 10<br>WIS: 14<br>CHA: 14 (26)<br><br>Ability points at level 4, 8 and 36 go to STR.
