<b>Playable from level 1 - 40...PvM Build</b><br><br>I created this because I wanted to have a strong caster who wasn't limited to attack spells without saving throws but who could still wade into melee when he wants.  It's more about versatility than being the most uber character ever.  I also don't like still spell/auto still spell I-III, as I prefer to be able to use all my spells as I get them without waiting for those feats.  Plus, I'm just not a big fan of the plate wearing mage.  So, this build starts with higher dex, so that with Cat's Grace and minimal dex boosting gear (+1 DEX is enough), you can wear leather armor and only have 1 AC less than in full plate and only 10% chance of spell failure.  With higher dex boosting gear (especially if you hit the +12 cap), you can switch to padded armor or robes for AC equal to plate mail and 5% or 0% spell failure.  Anyway, here is the build:<br><br>Human, any non-evil<br><br>STR 15 (16)<br>DEX 15 (16)<br>CON 12<br>WIS 8<br>INT 16 (28)<br>CHA 8<br><br>Increase STR at level 4, DEX at level 8, and INT all the rest<br><br><br>1: Fighter(1) - Weapon Proficiency Exotic, Ambidexterity, TWF<br>2: Wizard(1) - specialize in Illusion, Familiar: Panther<br>3: Fighter(2) - Weapon Focus (Two-Bladed Sword), Knockdown<br>4: Wizard(2)<br>5: Fighter(3)<br>6: Fighter(4) - Weapon Specialization (Two-Bladed Sword), Power Attack<br>7: Wizard(3)<br>8: Fighter(5)<br>9: Wizard(4) - Toughness<br>10: Fighter(6) - Cleave<br>11: Wizard(5) - Spell Focus (Evocation)<br>12: CoT(1) - Spell Penetration<br>13: CoT(2) - Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br>14: Wizard(6)<br>15: CoT(3) - Maximize Spell<br>16: CoT(4) - Improved Critical (Two-Bladed Sword)<br>17: Wizard(7)<br>18: CoT(5) - Greater Spell Penetration<br>19: CoT(6) - Improved Knockdown<br>20: Wizard(8)<br>21: Wizard(9) - Epic Weapon Focus (Two-Bladed Sword)<br>22: Wizard(10) - Greater Spell Focus (Evocation)<br>23: Wizard(11)<br>24: Wizard(12) - Great Intelligence I<br>25: Wizard(13)<br>26: Wizard(14)<br>27: Wizard(15) - Great Intelligence II/III<br>28: Wizard(16)<br>29: Wizard(17)<br>30: Wizard(18) - Epic Spell Focus (Evocation)<br>31: Wizard(19)<br>32: Wizard(20) - Great Intelligence IV<br>33: Wizard(21) - Epic Spell (Epic Warding)<br>34: Wizard(22)<br>35: Wizard(23) - Epic Spell (Epic Mage Armor)<br>36: Wizard(24) - Armor Skin<br>37: Wizard(25)<br>38: Wizard(26) - Epic Spell Penetration<br>39: CoT(7) - Epic Weapon Specialization (Two-Bladed Sword)<br>40: CoT(8) - Epic Prowess<br><br>Skills (335 total points)<br>Concentration 41<br>Discipline 43<br>Spellcraft 41<br>Tumble 20<br>That leaves 170 for whatever you want (I like Lore, Heal, Search, Disable Trap, and Persuade)<br><br>Unbuffed AB with mundane two-bladed sword - 31/26/21/16 in main hand, 31/26 in off-hand<br>Unbuffed AC with mundane leather armor - 21<br>Unbuffed damage with mundane two-bladed sword - 1-8 + 9 (17-20/x2) in main hand, 1-8 + 7 (17-20/x2) in off-hand<br>Unbuffed max HP = 324<br>Unbuffed saves - Fortitude 27, Reflex 26, Will 23<br><br>Buffed AB (without True Strike) with mundane two-bladed sword - 38/33/28/23/40* in main hand, 38/33 in off-hand<br>Buffed AB (with True Strike) with mundane two-bladed sword - 53/48/43/38/55* in main hand, 53/48 in off-hand<br>Buffed damage with mundane two-bladed sword - 2-12 + 26 (15-20/x2) in main hand, 2-12 + 23 (15-20/x2) in off-hand<br>Buffed AC with mundane leather armor - 48<br>Buffed max HP - 404<br>Buffed saves - Fortitude 29, Reflex 28, Will 25<br><br>*During testing, I noticed that the extra attack from Haste does <b>not</b> take dual wielding penalties into account.  That's why it's 2 points higher than the first attack.<br><br>AB is still not great after buffing.  The full +12 to STR would raise it to 42.  But you do get 3 attacks at your highest AB and 2 attacks at your next highest, so that helps a bit.  I generally play through single player modules or small multiplayer campaigns, so that's not as much of an issue as it would be in PvP for example.  But, any enemy with AC that high that you can't strip with Mordenkainen's Disjunction should be attacked with spells anyway.  Mostly I built this because it's fun to play as a fairly strong caster who can still slice his enemies up if he wishes.  Plus, it's fun to taunt the pure mages by stripping them of their buffs and then keeping them on the ground with Improved Knockdown and beating them to death <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> .<br><br>Steve

I had to look at this for a long time. At first glance, it doesn't appear to seem that much, but it actually kind of rocks.  Very well-considered.  Fighter-Mage old-school, and he's not elf.

For one, I think it looks cool as a wizard weapon, sort of like a sword/staff.  I would take it for that reason alone.  Plus, it lets you dual wield medium weapons (the same as two longswords) without the penalty, and you still only have one weapon to cast flame weapon, GMW, and keen edge on.  Plus, those extra attacks at your highest AB from dual wielding help a lot with a lower AB build like this.<br><br>As a side note, one way you could make the build stronger would be to drop it to 4 fighter levels, and go fighter(4)/wizard(8)/CoT(8) pre-epic.  You'd have to go fighter(4)/wizard(6) before starting CoT though.  Your saves will be higher that way.  I choose this leveling because I like the balanced leveling between melee and wizard as you build it up.

Cool build Steve. Heh - style points indeed!

I'm thinking Necromancy might be a better school for the spell focus.  There are quite a few necromancy spells that would be very useful on the way up and at high levels, especially for a fighter mage (lots of strength and level lowering spells, not to mention Horrid Wilting and Wail of the Banshee).  As for evocation, a lot of the best evocation spells (ice storm, the bigby's, ILMS and IGMS) don't have saving throws anyway, making the spell focus a bit less useful.  Of course, the Torm levels are a bit odd RP wise with necromancy, although you can switch to fighter and take a hit to your saves.  Hrm...any thoughts?<br><br>Steve

Start with 14 STR, 15 DEX, and 14 CON, and put the first two stat boosts into STR.  You end up with the same stats but you can keep Ambi/TWF at level 1 (in fact, all the feats can be kept) and thus can wield your intended weapon well sooner than level 6.

Thanks for answering that Grizz.  Yes, it's not documented anywhere to my knowledge (not even the Grimoire), but CoT is the one other class that can in fact get EWS as long as you already have WS somewhere.  And yes, it is on the CoT epic bonus feat list as well.  It is extremely useful, as it's far preferable to take 2 more CoT (at least up to CoT 10) than it is to take 2 more fighter levels.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 06/08/05 17:09</span></i></p>

I've toyed with the build order a bit more, as well as the stats, so here's a new version.  It has a few less skill points (291 instead of 335), but still more than enough for a wizard/fighter.  Also, I have it here with spell focuses in Evocation, but you could also do something like Necromancy if you like (or, of course, any other school you feel like).  Necromancy would be a bit more of an RP stretch for a CoT build though.<br><br>Human, any non-evil<br><br>STR 14 (16)<br>DEX 15<br>CON 14<br>WIS 8<br>INT 16 (28)<br>CHA 8<br><br>Increase STR at level 4 and 8, and INT all the rest<br><br><br>1: Fighter(1) - Weapon Proficiency Exotic, Ambidexterity, TWF<br>2: Wizard(1) - specialize in Illusion, Familiar: Panther<br>3: Fighter(2) - Weapon Focus (Two-Bladed Sword), Knockdown<br>4: Wizard(2)<br>5: Fighter(3)<br>6: Fighter(4) - Weapon Specialization (Two-Bladed Sword), Power Attack<br>7: Wizard(3)<br>8: Wizard(4)<br>9: Wizard(5) - Toughness, Spell Focus (Evocation)<br>10: Wizard(6)<br>11: CoT(1)<br>12: CoT(2) - Spell Penetration, Cleave<br>13: Wizard(7)<br>14: CoT(3)<br>15: CoT(4) - Greater Spell Focus (Evocation)/Improved TWF<br>16: CoT(5)<br>17: CoT(6) - Improved Critical (Two Bladed Sword)<br>18: Wizard(8) - Greater Spell Penetration<br>19: CoT(7)<br>20: CoT(8) - Improved Knockdown<br>21: Wizard(9) - Epic Weapon Focus (Two-Bladed Sword)<br>22: Wizard(10) - Maximize Spell<br>23: Wizard(11)<br>24: Wizard(12) - Epic Spell Focus (Evocation)<br>25: Wizard(13)<br>26: Wizard(14)<br>27: Wizard(15) - Great Intelligence I/II<br>28: Wizard(16)<br>29: Wizard(17)<br>30: Wizard(18) - Great Intelligence III<br>31: Wizard(19)<br>32: Wizard(20) - Great Intelligence IV<br>33: Wizard(21) - Epic Spell (Epic Warding)<br>34: Wizard(22)<br>35: Wizard(23) - Epic Spell (Epic Mage Armor)<br>36: Wizard(24) - Armor Skin<br>37: Wizard(25)<br>38: Wizard(26) - Epic Spell Penetration<br>39: CoT(9) - Epic Weapon Specialization (Two-Bladed Sword)<br>40: CoT(10) - Epic Prowess<br><br>Steve
