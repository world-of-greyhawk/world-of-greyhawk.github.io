Hello everyone.  This is my first build, and as such I won’t be at all surprised if it contains errors.  The idea of the build is to create a pure dual-wielder who relies on speed, dexterity, and well-placed blows to kill opponents quickly.  He excels at fighting multiple opponents simultaneously.  His defense relies on avoidance rather than mitigation, so for both RP reasons and practicality, he tends to use robes or very light armor.  After I started working on this build, I found the Tempest class in the PRC.  The Tempest is much closer to what I’d actually like, but this is a fun alternative using only Bioware classes.<br><br>Roleplay:  <br>The Twinblade has dedicated his body and soul to an ideal joining of his weapons to his body.  He strives to go beyond one man with two weapons, to become one weapon with two points.  His weapons are identical in all mundane respects, and he scarcely notices which blade is in which hand.  Twinblades are trained to fight multiple opponents simultaneously, extending their personal philosophies to view a group of foes as one enemy with many vulnerable target points.  A Twinblade will actively scorn any but the most basic defensive tactics and equipment that do not rise from his own speed and skill, instead relying on a simple mantra: the best defense is the absence of attackers.<br><br>-------------------------------<br><br>(I borrowed Cinnabar’s post format, since it seemed pretty clear.

The ability to wear almost any gear should allow you to balance the character more or less either way.

A few things I'll point out (btw, you're welcome to use my format if you like - I know I'm used to it, so I find it really easy to read!):<br><br>I'd delay the TWF feat a bit, since you suffer penalties while dual-wielding and you don't want that at low levels where your AB is low. I'd take Dodge at level 1, Mobility at level 3, and TWF at level 5 or 6. That's usually where I find dual-wielding starts to become effective. Until then, just go sword and board. That's just a personal bias, though.<br><br>I'd take that last Rogue level at level 37. You can still get high Search and Disable Trap if you want (40 each). You'll get UMD to 40 and, since the skill relies on multiples of 5, that's all you need. You might also consider putting points into Spellcraft, as you get a +1 bonus on your saves vs spells for each 5 modified ranks in it. 18 ranks (it will cost 36 skill points, as it's cross classed) is enough for +4 to saves vs spells, which will help a lot on that Will save.<br><br>Speaking of Will saves, I think you've miscalculated that one. It should be 15. And the others should be:<br><br>Fort: 23<br>Refl: 27<br><br>I also think your AB is miscalculated. You have BAB +19 at level 20. That means +29 at level 40.<br><br>+1 Weapon Focus<br>+2 Epic WF<br>+1 Epic Prowess<br>+4 Weapon Master levels<br>+5 Weapon Finesse<br> <br>Total: +42. Dual wielding woould drop that to +40.<br><br>Another thing: you can't take Damage Reduction with only 18 CON. You need a minimum 21 CON to take those feats.<br><br>I'd also advise not splitting your ability increases into 3 different stats. If you really want the DR feats, then I'd advise going for CON and DEX (but you'd really need to min/max the build for that by starting with higher CON, which means lower CHA and/or STR). Otherwise, put all your increases to DEX.<br><br>Overwhelming Critical requires STR of 23+, so that's another feat for which you won't qualify.<br><br>Improved Whirlwind requires a minimum DEX of 23 to qualify as well.<br><br>Your AC is base 10, then add all modifiers:<br><br>10<br>+5 (DEX)<br>+2 (Armor Skin)<br>+8 (Tumble)<br><br>total 25. Generally Dodge and Mobility aren't counted in that total, as they're situational and don't apply all the time.<br><br>Your build is an interesting concept but needs a lot of reworking to figure out what you want to keep and what you'll be willing to drop. Feel free to ask for advice if you need help. There are plenty of people here that are good resources for building characters.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Thanks very much for the input.  Apparently I didn't quite understand the formula for increasing BAB, and I simply didn't know the base AC value.  I will rework the build.  Is it considered better to edit an existing build or post a new version of the same build?<br><br>BTW... when figuring required ability scores for certain feats, do ability bonuses from gear count? If I get STR up to 23 with gear, can I take Overwhelming Critical?  That'd be great for making the build work, but I'm not sure I'd agree with it from a roleplay point of view.<br><br>Thanks again for all the help!

Never count equipment.<br><br>As for AC, start with a base of 10.  I usually throw in mundane armor or shield if any, add Tumble(+8 in this case), and Armor Skin.  You can even toss in Dodge for 1 AC if you want.  Based upon your current build design, his naked AC is 10+8+2+5+1(dodge)=26.  Throw on some Leather armor(his Dex will give him +5)=28.  Toss on a Tower shield= 31.  Wearing Plate and Tower shield =32.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
