Very interesting.  YOu should post that your build is for PVP born at lv 40 though.

Thanks for the welcome, avado.  However, aside from not using a two-handed weapon, I don't see what's so ridiculous about the way I've built this.  A high-STR tank which gets WF, Cleave, Imp Crit, and IKD pre-epic is never something to gripe about, and that much Ranger is necessary pre-epic to max BAB.  Dev Crit comes pretty early, along with Curse Song for reducing enemy AB and saves.  You don't need to use two weapons throughout the build... just toss on a shield and you've got yourself a pretty standard longsword-toting tank.<br><br>I'll repeat myself: this build is made to dual-wield Longswords (or Bastard Swords if you prefer) to good effect.  I like the idea of swingin' two big swords around - who wouldn't? - and didn't see a build on here that catered to that.  Given this purpose behind the build, any points about the way it's built from level one or not using a two-handed weapon are pretty much moot.

Firstly I like the idea behind this one, dual wielding medium weapons is always fun. <br><br>Here's my comments on this one.<br><br>I am curious to know why Bard 9? any driving reason beyond the one extra third level spell and extra bard song/ day?<br><br>If you restricted yourself to Bard 4, RDD 10 and Ranger 26, you could gain:<br><br>- A stronger animal Companion<br>- Three Epic Feats (two bonus and a substituted Favored Enemy at 25th)<br>- Extra HP<br>- Extra duration in level based duration Ranger spells<br>- You maintain the same bonus to AB &amp; Damage from Bard &amp; Curse Song<br><br>Also I am puzzled as to why you chose WIS 13 as you are missing out on 4th level Ranger Spells.<br><br><i>Some notes on Skills:</i><br><br>Perform - With only 9 levels of Bard your Perform ranks (including CHA modifier) only requires 15 skill points, thus freeing you up 15 to be spent elsewhere.<br>Tumble - no point taking any more than 40 to gain the full benefit of the AC bonus<br><br>BAB - this could be increased further by delaying both Bard and RDD until epic levels, gaining you 2 extra points. Or indeed going Ranger 16/ Bard 4 pre-epic which would still result in an extra point. I realise you would forego Dev Crit at 24th level going this route by the way.<br><br>As far as feats go there is one that I am surprised is missing, bearing in mind the melee presence you seek, and that is 'Blind Fight'. This helps tremendously with concealed opponents and can be critical to survival I have found personally.<br><br>My preference is to forego KD and IKD, unless I the character I play can deliver Sneak/ Death Attack Damage, but as I say this is preference. The only reason I comment on this, is that you could gain 2 pre-epic feats for some other purpose instead.<br><br>If you are going Ranger for Dual Wielding then why not drop starting DEX to 8? You have Cats Grace as a Ranger Spell anyway and Dex enhanced items are generally quite easy to find. <br><br><i>Ranger and multiples of 5:</i> "The character gains a +1 bonus to any damage delivered to his favored enemy. He also receives a +1 bonus on Listen, Spot, and Taunt checks against the favored enemy. These bonuses improve by +1 for every 5 levels that the Ranger gains," quite useful to be honest.<br><br>See the link for my take on this, but purely as reference for your build. There may be something of interest there for you...<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "267959", "0", "#1900734", ' target="_blank"');</script>Sharp Teeth Ranger - Ranger 26, Bard 4, Red Dragon Disciple 10</a><br><br><b>Major Changes:</b><br><br>- Base AB is up 4 points to 48 with a mundane weapon and STR to 38 (+14 modifier)<br>- HP up by 60 to 528<br>- AC Leather (25) and with Tower Shield (28)<br>- Dev Crit DC up by 1 to 44<br>- Fort Save is down 1, Reflex has no change and Will is down by 7 to 15.<br>- Dev Crit is not available until 27th in this version, some 3 levels later.<br>- You also benefit from a full complement of Ranger Spells 1st (4), 2nd (4), 3rd (4) and 4th (4).<br><br>Also of note is that you have a higher Spell Penetration check of 26+1d20 when trying to overcome Spell Resistance, making what little offensive magics that much more probable to be effective in combat (eg. Entangle, Grease and Sleep). <br><br>Bear in mind the Taunt skill is also available, which is a healthy 44 ranks unbuffed and without items. <br>You could drop 2 Great Strength Feats in favour of an ESF: Taunt and another epic feat, without too much major impact on it here.<br><br>Ideas for you to consider really.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 03/08/07 22:10</span></i></p>

The lvls should be put together in a way that makes the building process enjoyable.  Its in the little things, like taking bard lvls throughout at lv 22, 27, 32,37 for example for tumble dumps.  Taking 20 straight ranger lvs for 30 bab.  Even as simple as leaving stats on important things like wisdom for rangers or pals at the lvl that actually gets them things (14 wis for example). OR something like BoE, which is a KEY of this build yet you delay it unnecessarily.  And, is IKD necessary, with no sneak damage?  WHat about fixing the gimped dual ab and take ambi and twf.. even itwf (which means adjusting the int/dex).   These are what ALSO goes into a Epic build, not just what you end with.  just my 2 cents.

Well!  I forgot about Taunt.  Some responses to be made here.<br><br>+ The build is built the way it is (with Bard and RDD so early) BECAUSE it allows Dev Crit so early with two weapons.  That should be a reason to think I build things from the ground up - which I do.<br>+ DEX is at 10 because a DEX buff/equip cap of 22(+6) allows Leather armor's DEX bonus cap to be "filled," netting 1 more AC.<br>+ I suppose if your server doesn't have any Freedom of Movement equipment, you could go ranger level 4 spells... but that is the ONLY spell on level 4 worth having at late levels... in fact, even late pre-epic levels when you would first get them.<br>+ Bard level 8 gives +2 AB with Bardsong, and <b>three level 3 Bard spells with one spell slot</b> - Keen Edge, Mag Circle, perhaps also Haste if it's needed!  I'm surprised no one picked up on this.  This and the previous point were the reasons I picked 13 WIS and 13 CHA.  After Ranger 21, RDD 10, Bard 8, one more Bard level was the only thing that made sense - another Bard casterlevel and a second level 3 spell slot.<br><br>I did forget about Taunt... but people (especially Avado) seem to be looking only at the weaknesses of this build, not at the strengths.  Ranger 26 / Bard 4 / RDD 10 is good, I've no doubt, but so is this.  I will consider changing out KD and IKD, however, that was a good point!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Dev Crit DC went down by one, but it's already quite high, especially when buffed/equipped up to the cap of 46.  Later appearance of RDD levels means more BAB, but I just HAD to stick Bard in at 18.  -2 Enemy AB through Curse Song beats out 1 more BAB... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>Dev Crit comes six levels later, but BoE comes NINE levels sooner.  I still prefer level 3 Bard spells to level 4 Ranger spells, so no ability points were moved.  They're all buffs, so no need to worry about arcane spell failure, just remove armor and cast before combat.<br><br>Vital stats:<br>HP = <b>468</b> maxed<br>BAB = <b>29</b><br>AB w/2 mundane Bastard Swords = <b>41</b><br>AB w/1 mundane Bastard Sword = <b>45</b><br>Base Damage = <b>13-22</b><br>Damage vs FEs = <b>20-39</b><br>AC w/mundane leather armor = <b>24</b><br>AC w/armor and mundane tower shield = <b>27</b><br>Saves = Fort <b>24</b>, Reflex <b>18</b>, Will <b>19</b><br><br>BAB and both AB went up by one; max damage went up, although average damage per round is the same.  For some reason, Fort save is lower, despite having more Ranger levels pre-epic, but I think it's a mistake on my part, either before or now.  Note that the original build was tested in a leveler; this update has not been.  Everything but the saves I have double-checked and am certain about; thanks to a quick comparison with Samphus' build, I think the first version was mistaken even though it was built in a leveler.<br><br>Buffs:<br>+2 AB from Bardsong, +1 AB from Aid, +6 AB from STR at cap, plus +7 AB vs FEs = maximum <b>61</b> AB self-buffed with one sword.<br>+1 Dodge AC from Mage Armor, +6 AC from DEX at cap, +4 AC from Haste = maximum <b>38</b> AC self-buffed with tower shield.<br>+1 to all saves from Bardsong, +1 to all saves from Resistance = Fort <b>26</b>, Reflex <b>20</b>, Will <b>21</b> self-buffed.<br><br>All the above is with mundane equipment, except for STR and DEX at their caps.<br><br>Comparison with I... Samphus' build (positive differences in bold):<br>- His AB is 2 higher, thanks to 1 more BAB and 4 more STR; my higher-grade Bardsong offsets it by one.<br>- His HP is 60 higher, thanks to Toughness and more Ranger levels.<br>- <b>My Will save is 4 higher...?</b>  I understand the single pre-epic Bard level gives 2, but beyond that I'm not sure.  I've a sneaking suspicion that Samphus miscalculated - 20 Ranger levels plus Epic save progression should equal at least 16 Will.<br>- <b>My AC is a net 1 higher</b>, thanks to Armor Skin offsetting his -1 penalty to AC from DEX, and my Curse Song dropping enemy AB by 2.<br>- His Dev Crit DC is a net 1 higher, thanks to his 4 more STR and my Curse Song.<br>- I have the <b>Keen Edge</b>, <b>Magic Circle Against Alignment</b> and <b>Wounding Whispers</b> spells, allowing more AC against certain alignments and much better melee damage against melee opponents.<br><br>Summary:<br>I lose 2 AB, 1 Dev Crit DC, 1 Fort save, and 60 HP (or 20 if Toughness)<br>I gain 2 Will save, 1 AC, Keen Edge, more reliable Taunt, and a damage shield<br><br>After taking all that into consideration, one must also consider that in a party setting, I would be able to buff more.  Both builds are quite good, now that I've made some changes based on some wonderful suggestions!<br><br>It all comes down to preference, though in party play I think my friends would rather I played my build for the party buffs.  If you really care about AB and Dev DC, go with his build, definitely.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By johannhowitzer on 03/20/07 02:53</span></i></p>

One little amendment: if you don't need such a terribly high Taunt, by all means drop the last two feats in favor of two Great Strengths - 1 more damage and dev crit DC, at the cost of 10 to Taunt skill.  It's up to you.
