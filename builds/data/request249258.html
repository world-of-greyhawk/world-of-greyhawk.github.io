Could some enterprising soul create a complete stat list for familiars?  As a mage levels up, their familiars do to, every 5 levles seems to be the sweet spot for new abilities.  I'd like to see a sticky made (much like the breakdown of the classes) made in this forum.  Another thread could be made for Animal Companions.<br><br><br>Example of what would be nice:<br><br><br>(MADE UP NUMBERS since I don't know them)<br>Eyeball<br><br>str/int/dex/...<br><br>lvl 5:  Cold Bolt 2/day, 2d4 cold, DC 14 vs reflex...<br>lvl 10: Stun Bolt 1/day, DC 14 fort save<br>etc...<br><br>stuff like that.<br><br><br>Alot of this information has to be extracted from the scripts, DC saves, #/day, etc...<br><br><br>So... does anyone feel up to it?<br>(I'm not proficiant enough with the scripts to know where to look.)

I like the idea, heh, I use Druids often but I don't know exactly how the Animal Companion stats are, i.e. at the beggining the Bear is far stronger but with levels the Panther can beat it with the sneak attack, but I don't know the AB progression to compare, etc. etc. etc.<br><br>However, it is odd that you ask someone else to do just like that, I won't do it... hell that, but you could make a start-up with regular stats that don't need any scripting to get (AB, HP, AC, saves, immunities) and that way lessening the work of (in case someone does) the one that takes the job.

You can't look at your familiar Eyeball and see the DC of his bolt attack.<br><br>You'd have to go into battle for that, and to be accurate, you'd have to attack with it at each of it's levels... if you relied only on the ingame visual stats.<br><br>OR<br><br>A person could look in the scripts and write down the stats.  I don't know which script or I would have done so a long time ago.<br><br>I just think it would be handy for everyone if those types of stats are listed.

I remember that pulse cap managed to pull out a complete and detailed list of PM summons. He's got both the skills and the means to do such an enterprise, you could try asking him.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Unto to the darkness<br>I commend my soul<br>Never shall I repent<br>Never shall I be saved<br><br>I'll go into the House of Death<br>Before my last breath<br>My enemies all shall die!
