If you want a a sword-weilding Sorcerer, it might be best to be Lawful Good, so you can make use of the Charisma as a fighter. I included Fighter and Paladin Levels here. If you don't want to be good, just replace the Paladin levels with more fighter levels. <br><br>Starting Stats:<br>Human<br>Lawful Good<br><br>STR- 15<br>DEX- 10<br>CON- 12<br>WIS- 14<br>CHA- 15<br><br>Level Progression:<br>17 levels of Sorcerer<br>3 levels of Fighter<br>1 level of Sorcerer<br>2 levels Paladin<br>1 level Sorcerer<br>2 levels Paladin<br>1 level Sorcerer<br>2 levels Fighter<br>1 level Sorcerer<br><br>21 Sorcerer/5 Fighter/4 Paladin<br><br>Taken this way, if you maximize Concentration and Spellcraft with every Sorcerer level, you should get Auto Still Spell at level 30.

yeah use BG and if you can attain good AC with a greatsword or another big weapon then remember to increase the 13+ requirement str to 14 to gain more power from the twohanded weapon. Divine might and divine shield are really good for such a build.<br><br>I suggest u take 16sorc/3BG/1fighter as per lvl 20 and then quickly gain more prowess by taking 2 lvls of ftr for additionel feats and then 1 sorc. at lvl 24 u would get a bonus epic feat and a normal feat, which i would use for epic wpn spec. then you can aquire 1 sorc bonus feat because at lvl 30 your setup would look like this:<br>23sorc/3BG/4ftr.<br><br>Hope this helps<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kalmar_Oxin on 01/11/05 23:18</span></i></p>

Debatable; since you could use spells to cover your shortcomings from a shield.  Catch is that normal (ie non-epic) spells are dispellable; so you will be in deep trouble if you are up against a fighter/caster mob collection.

I am also looking for a good Fighter-type Sorc build.<br><br>Actually to be more accurate, more Sorc than Fighter, but one where the caster can duke it out if need be.<br><br>I know the more popular fighter/caster is the Fighter/Wiz variety (like one of my friend's Fighter/WM/Wiz combo, which is pretty darn effective at dishing out damage).<br><br>I thought to add just a bit more variety to the party, I'd do a Fighter (or Pally or BG)/WM/Sorc combo.  I know it doesn't work *quite* as well as the Wizard one, since the Wiz gains extra feats that the Sorcerer doesn't get when helping out with the WM class feats.  But I just like the way the Sorc casts spells (I hate book learnin').  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Has anyone dared to create a Fighter-type/WM/Sorc combo?  I want at least 20+ levels of Sorc, since I want an Epic Spell or two and better SR defeating type ability.<br><br>Anyone successfully do say a Pally (or BG)/RDD/Sorc combo?

Umm... if you want 4 attacks per round you basically have a choice between auto-still spell 2 and 3 and an epic spell.  With the shortage of feats and the need to take most of the sorc. levels epic, you can't really get auto still or epic spells until level 36 or 39.  So either you go sorc 21/RDD 10/Paladin 9 and get an epic spell and another feat, or you go sorc 18/RDD 14/Paladin 8 and get the 3 auto stills.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Yup, you're right.  I just checked, I thought all you needed was the ability to cast level 9 spells.  In that case, I don't think it's possible to have Auto. Still 3 and 4 attacks per round.  By epic levels you can at best be Pally 8/RDD 8/Sorc 4.  If you take the next 17 levels as Sorc that would make you a Pally 8/RDD 8/Sorc 21 at level 37, that leaves level 39 for autostill spell or an epic spell, if you went Pally 6/RDD 8/Sorc 6 at level 20, you could go Pally 6/RDD 10/Sorc 24 at level 40 and use 36,39 and the sorc bonus feat to get all the auto stills.  But you would only 3 attacks per turn and no epic spells. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <br><br>I guess fighter/wiz is just plain better as a spellsword.  I even worked up a version of my Magical Marauder that gives up disarm, improved disarm and improved combat casting to get a 37 fortitude save and 40 more hit points.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

You can take autostill at lvl18 for a wizard; lvl19 for a sorcerer provided your _character_ level is above lvl21; and able to cast lvl9 spells.  Epic spells require 21 levels of the mage class to take.  There are three autostill feats to take; otherwise it's worthless since it works in three levels.  So if you take autostill 1 at lvl30; you will only be autostilled on lvl0-3 spells<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 01/19/05 09:16</span></i></p>

Thanks a LOT for posting that build, CC!  Very nice of ya to take the time to do.<br><br>On my PW, Devastating Crit has been banned, so prolly would swap out it and OC from the list of feats and take probably one or more spell penetration feats.<br><br>Though am still up in the air as to what I want to do with it.  I know I want mostly caster (to get thru the SR's of some of the critters on that realm), but trying both to determine just how MUCH caster and what Fighter class(s) to go with it.<br><br>The Pally/RDD/Sorc has the a lot of good synergy to it.  The Fighter/WM/Sorc less so.  Though I think the Fighter/WM version can do a lot more melee damage.  Haven't run the numbers to make sure, however.   And I'm sure it will be a bit feat starved as well.<br><br>In that build I'd probably want at least 22-23 levels of Sorcability.  Mainly for the SR and the Epic Spells (even if most of them suck).  Though Hellball was upped in that world.<br><br>Keep the ideas a comin'!<br><br>Thanks again, CC .. will definitely look into that build of yours when I have the time here.<br><br>Joe

Prolly not as good combat damage as the WM version, but with the STR bonuses and all, could be decent .. <br><br>Thanks in advance for your opinions!<br><br>Joe</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I have made a build that's probably what you're looking for. You get 4 attacks, auto still 3 and lvl 9 sorc spells. You also get lvl 2 pally spells so you can combine aura of glory with eagle's splendor. You can choose between full RDD bonuses or epic spells.<br><br>Here's the link: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "166519", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>_________________<br>There are no facts, only interpretations.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 02/04/05 08:55</span></i></p>

Cool...that's pretty darn close to what I want.<br><br>Though it looks like in order to get my 4 attacks/round, I will have to say goodbye to Epic Spells.  <br><br>I might just go F/RDD/Sorc and see where that takes me.  Or go with my original idea of F/WM/Sorc.<br><br>Too bad those darn Sorc's are so feat-starved .. sigh.<br><br>Thanks again for the link ..<br><br>Joe

You can get 4 attacks and epic spells, but then you won't get all the RDD bonuses.<br>_________________<br>There are no facts, only interpretations.
