It's an okay build, getting the important powers, except from bardsong, before lvl 30. BUT, I would drop the last BG level, what is that for? I would go Ranger 26, for three Epic feats, opening two for EP and EWF. Ranger 26/BG2/Bard12. If you want the bard song, then Ranger 23/BG2/Bard 15 would also give you a feat, but slightly worse Bard song. <br><br>I like the build, i like most well-built Rangers, but I think more ranger would improve it further.<br><br>SKÅL.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

Oh, makes me think of <i>Graveland - Call of the Black Forest</i>. Legends of Polish BM (read reviews <a href="http://www.anus.com/metal/graveland.html" target="_blank">here</a>) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Nice, evil build! I'd prefer Lingering Song over Stealthy though. The level spread is fine, but I think Bard17 is more beneficial than Blackguard3 (Bard gives more spell slots at least).<br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm
