Hi all<br><br>I don't know how active this board still is, but I figured I'd give it a shot asking my question here.<br><br>I've got a multiplayer RP game planned in a few days, and the character I'm going to play is a melee fighter who wears no armour and uses a Greatsword for a weapon. It's not meant to be a hugely powerful PvP build obviously, but I'd still like to get the maximum out of it in terms of power and playability.<br><br>The main problem is what to focus on. A Greatsword isn't finessable, so STR is needed for a decent AB, but since he won't be wearing Full Plate, DEX is needed to gain some AC. I've been thinking about doing something with Monk/Cleric, using WIS to partially make up for the lack in AC and using Cleric spells to buff up for melee. I've also been thinking of using Bard/RDD somehow, since the Bardsong, Bard buffing spells, and the RDD's STR and AC bonus could be pretty effective.<br><br>Anyway, I'd probably be able to think of something half-decent on my own, but I'd love some input on this. The goal is to create a character that follows these rules:<br>- Only use cloth armour<br>- Use a Greatsword for a weapon<br>- No offensive spells (buffs are ok though)<br>- Needs to be playable at all levels (it's ok if it has some rough spots, but it needs to be able to hold it's own at any time)<br>- Needs to end up with decent AB, AC, and damage<br>- No aligment shifts<br>- No Dev Crit (not really a requirement, I just don't like Dev Crit)<br><br>If anyone could either post some tips on how to do this in the best way possible, or point me in the direction of any builds that could (perhaps with some minor changes) achieve this, I'd be very grateful.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By LuckyNephilim on 07/15/07 15:31</span></i></p>

Cloth armor with a Greatsword, interesting, well, I'd definitely sort that out with a Dwarven Defender, that way you won't even need AC to resist damage, though I admit it won't boost playability on low levels since you need a lot of levels to work it out cool enough, but try checking this, it should be easy to change weapon to Greatsword with the first one, since he's a dual-wielder you'll even get extra feats, the second already has Greatsword:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "245491", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Terrifying Tank (Barbarian 16 / Fighter 6 / Dwarven Defender 18)</a><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "265734", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Woodland Dwarf (Ranger 22 / Fighter 4 / Dwarven Defender 14)</a><br><br>Or well, a Dwarven Defender / Fighter / Cleric could also work fine though my curent build on that won't allow you to take Greatsword since it uses the club exploit.<br><br>Dwarven Defenders make up very well for the lack of AC, the AB might not be too high but it's decent, you don't have to take EDR with all Dwarven Defenders, they already resist quite good, so you can pump up more STR instead if you wish.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Try <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "272188", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>this</a> build posted by myself.  It is solid at all levels (due to Cleric buffs), and it is pure melee.  A good companion to any group, due to its ability to buff friendlies with weapon enhancements, AC increasers (shield of faith, UEF, magic vestment).  And did I mention it heals? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
