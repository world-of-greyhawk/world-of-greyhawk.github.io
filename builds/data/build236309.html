The Duergar Infiltrator<br><br>The plan for this build is to make a underdark spy that can infiltrate as a Duergar with longbow, Drow with longsword, Drider with a spear or an Illithid (Mindflayer) with special abilities. Its my first shifter after 4 years of nonstop playing and im kinda happy with the results. I'v seen alot of simmulare builds but with other shapes as the focus and none with longbow as 2nd focus.<br><br>Starting stats;<br><br>Race: Dwarf (Subrace Duergar)<br>Algiment: LN, CN or NE<br>Class: Fighter<br><br>Attributes;<br><br>Str: 10<br>Dex: 8<br>Con: 18<br>Int: 13<br>Wis: 17<br>Cha: 6<br><br>Skills to focus in;<br><br>Concentration<br>Tumble<br>Spellcraft<br>Discipline<br>Heal<br><br>Save the rest<br><br>--------------------------------<br>Level Progression;<br><br>*  = Fighter Bonusfeat<br>** = Shifter Bonusfeat<br>***= Replaceable Feat<br><br>Overall lvl, Class, Class lvl, Class Bonusfeat, Regular Feat, Attribute Increase[##]<br><br>1.

It should be perfect as a tank with its high hp and not too bad in combat either.

It's a great character idea, with interesting RP possibilities. <br>Is it a PvM build, or PvP?<br>You can add NN to the alignment list.<br>Have you thought of taking druid and shifter levels earlier? With dex 8 and str 10 I would think it'd be a good thing to get the shifter forms as soon as possible.<br>If you want better saves against spells you can take a druid lvl at lvl 36 or later to get spellcraft to 39(40).<br>You will only lose epic toughness II (20 hp). Btw. where is epic toughness I?<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 04/06/06 09:45</span></i></p>

Yea, its perfect for any underdark RP i suppose, altho im playing it on a high magic PvM server. i dont think it will work very good in pvp tho, maybe cause of the hp but the ac and ab is way too low to make it any good. And ya, i forgot TN in the alg list, NG works aswell but i doubt that there are many NG Duergars in the underdark...

Yes, usually shifters are strongest on low magic servers, because of their many innate abilities.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

As a druid/shifter fanatic, I just have to ask.... Why wisdom? None of yours shapes require wisdom, nor do you get any of those that do require it, and are useful... And only thing I can see that it is actually good for, is mindblast, and Zen Archery. Methinks that those points would be better spend on more constitution since you don't use your high wisdom for those fantastic and useful shapes. With the majority being con-variable. (rakshasa, vampire, spectre, golems). Just me being wierd though. Really, it's a good build.. I just think spending 11 stat points/feats on a stat you're not going to use (except for that minimal +6 boost to mindblast) is a bit of a waste. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif"><br>_________________<br>"First you get the spoons, then you get the women" -Hawk

well yea, u could go for higher con but i wanted a decent ab with longbow as this build uses longbow pretty much (as u probaly want to offer your services to other duergars and therefor, u need high wisdom. The wisdom will become 30 when ur in illithid shape anyway so i doubt 28 will improve your mindblast. And final, the saves needs to be decent and the will save will need to be high as you wont get mind immune in many shapes. The hp and fort save will still be high enough to survive most stuff <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">
