After muck thinking, i'm thinking of creating a Sorc/RDD and maybe with a level of monk thrown to gain some nifty bonuses...however, all the builds posted tend to focus more on the melee side...any ideas? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif">

Personally I think Wizards are better for PvM. However, if you're bent on sorcerers, you would be best off checking out the Exaulted Sorceress build on the Bioware epic builds page.<br><br>I can see no point in getting RDD is you're a primary caster. RDD is great for melee builds, but not much help to a caster.

Also you can have strength at 8 or even 6 to start with, RDD will compensate for this (eventually), so you get extra points to put elsewhere. Only your ability to bypass SR will be somewhat less good, other then that it should work just fine.
