hi<br>   Evange<br>this may help you....by Cyotis<br><br>**   **    **    **    **    **     **    **    **    **<br><br><br>Here is my idea of a "Fearless Monk"<br><br>25 Monk / 10 Pale Master / 5 Wizard (Human)<br><br>32 Strength &lt;- 18 Strength<br>10 Dexterity &lt;- 10 Dexterity<br>14 Constitution &lt;- 14 Constitution<br>14 Intelligence &lt;- 14 Intelligence<br>8 Wisdom &lt;- 8 Wisdom<br>8 Charisma &lt;- 8 Charisma<br><br>This Monk has a lot of immunities like to Critical Hits which is a big melee threat, High spell resistance to protect against high damage spells, Immunity to mind spells which covers a large spectrum of statis threats, immunity to being held and paralyse is great for a melee character so they can always get to the action to do the damage and he has 20 damage reduction along with empty body makes this monk hard to hit and do damage to. With high strength he does great damage (12-31) unarmed. 6 attacks possible with the first attack starting at 39 for attack bonus. With your wizard spells if u take all the buffing spells you can up your stats before a good fight. The add ability to summon some extra help in a battle is always a plus. If you take all the criticals you can do great damage. If you take the max HP for every level you can end up with 420 HP atleast if you only take one epic toughness.<br><br>First 20 levels are all Monk: giving all stat bonuses to strength and taking these feats: Great Cleave, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (unarmed), Improved Critical (unarmed), improved initiative, Luck of heros, Toughness and, Blind Fight.<br><br>The next five are the Wizard levels. Feats: Epic Weapon Focus (unarmed), Great Strength, Overwealming Critical and, Extend spell so the buffing spells i chose last longer. all stat bonuses to strength.<br><br>The 10 Levels after this are to Pale Master. All stat Bonuses to Strength. Feats: Great Strength ll and lll, Devistating Critical.<br><br>The last five levels are to Monk. All stat bonuses to Strength. Feats: Great Strength lv, and Epic Toughness.<br><br>Only Toughness, Epic Toughness, The critical attack feats(3), Weapon Focus, Epic Weapon Focus, Great Strength I - IV and Great Cleave are the real important feats to makeing this a great character. The rest are up the the player discretion.<br><br>In the end all skill can be divided up at the player discretion. Proferablly: 43 Disipline, 40 tumble, 43 listin, 43 heal and the rest to what ever.<br><br>The Fearless Monk truely has nothing to fear. He can take damage, deal damage, immune to high damaging attacks, very resistant to spells, immune to mind spells, immune to movement hinderances and immune to desease and poison.

This is a caster version of the Monk/Wiz/PM (actually Wiz/PM/Monk), but it's quite powerful.

Speed increases every 3 levels, so it will do so at 21. Put the other 2 in wiz so your spells last longer. At least, that's my suggestion.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

Screw the summons, it'll suck no matter what.  At level 38 do you think it'll make a diff?<br><br>Just go wiz 3/monk 21/pm 16 and you'll have the best of all worlds.  First 20 monk-3 wiz-16 pm-1 monk.  Get ep mage armor and epic warding and nothing will touch the monk.

Hmm.. thats an interesting point.  "You don't take pms for the summons"  to which i agree wholeheartedly.   But now heres the thing: i remember reading somewhere in Iconic builds that a pm is about summons.. LOL To change the topic 100000%..  what then is a pm good for (besides the imm to crit, bonus to AC, Epic spells (warding), and a super cool arm!   LOL<br><br>Peace

Oh I would agree entirely. But I was going on what Evange said (s)he wanted to do, which was drop 3 of those pm levels. Personally if I were to do the build I'd probably go 18 monk/16 pm/6 wiz.<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

... and if you want 9th level spells, I'd recommend 15 monk, 9 wizard, 16 Pale Master. Take PM 16 at level 39 to get both Epic Warding and Epic Mage Armour. Finish up with a level of monk to max tumble/disciple.
