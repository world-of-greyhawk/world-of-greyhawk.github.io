The search engine is a tool to help players find an IDEA for a build that could suit them.   If someone hasnt built one EXACTLY to your standards..  do it yourself.  Take miths or cins build and adapt it!  BUT before you do, read the reasons WHY they made the build that way.

I know the first time i used it i got no bard builds cuz i forgot to change the barabarian to bard!  It happens.    Its good to see that you now know how.  Maybe, post a bard build that you have modified and we can help you to tweak it to your liking (since we have helped you now locate MANY damage melee buffer bard builds).<br><br>Peace

It looks good.  If you really dont need that free feat (which appears to me to be a bard bonus feat, unless the bard gets armor skin as epic bonus) id suggest goin 5 ftr, taking the wpn spec at 24.  This would loose you epic prowess til 27.  I am assuming that you are taking perform, tumble, umd for skills?  Id look at concentration or spellcraft or heal for your others (depending on what you want).  Also, i got 2 extra stat points at lv 1, so make wis 10 to not give yourself a neg modifier to will saves.<br><br>All in all, a very solid build, imho.  nicely done<br><br>Peace
