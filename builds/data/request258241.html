Over the last several years Ive developed a fondness for axe throwing, trapping, and sneaking.  Axe throwing cause its over looked on nearly every PW, so unusual.  Trapping and sneaking cause its so damn fun in PvP and PvM.<br><br>So on that note Id like your help.  Ive played a few variations.  Rogue fighters (heavy rogue and enough fighter to hit), Rogue/Fighter/SDs, Ranger/Rogue/Fighter (26 ranger 13 rogue 1 fighter).  <br><br>The only problem I find with those builds is Fort saves (wills not great either, but forts bad mojo).  That and low AB, unless Im comming outta hide.  Id like either some stronger AB/bust damage, or a bit better staying power, heh hell both.<br><br>Id like some help building an axe throwing, trap laying sneak.  Ill likely need the sneak feats (stealthy, sf, esf) as its for a PvP world.  I wont need trap feats.<br><br>Anyways a new spin on an old play style for me would be welcome.  Its for PvP world.

It's a good suggestion from Mick. In addition to getting your requirements met, you also access healing for staying power, and improved invisibility for hiding and concealment, and on top of that you can pack Darkness/Ultravision combo too, which is excellent combined with ranged sneak-attacks.<br><br>Rogue14/Bard16/RDD10 can also be used, to increase throwing damage and to get much of the same goodies plus the songs which are great in group PvP.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 03/06/06 18:56:45 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br>Trollborn Asgardian by the master of the Norse legends, Grimnir himself!<br> <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Extra dex, hide/ms bonus, AC bonus, thrown weapon AB bonus.  <br><br>Ive thought about something like this in the past.  What would you think about a few ranger levels?  Maybe something like 20 Ranger pre epic (another pref enemy, higher BAB and more attacks per round)/15-16 Cleric (depends on how many cleric levels required to max out buffs from spells like Barkskin etc)/4-5 Monk (or rogue). <br><br>I was also thinking Travel and Trickery, or Travel and Plant depending on whether perma hasten gear is available.  Ive never taken war.  <br><br>Ranger, Cleric, and monk seem to have some nice overlap with the Wisdom.  With this build I might even go shurikens (I believe monks get this, so not exotic) instead of axes. <br><br>Would reducing cleric from your suggested level range affect buffs more than Im thinking?  Just duration pretty much right?  If I extend em, 16 levels aint to bad....  Hell alot of the good ones are long term buffs anyways.  Set to 1 turn or 1 hour per level.  Extended 24 turns/or hours is almost set it and forget it.  Especially in PvP fights.

If you have a pre epic BAB of 15 or less, the cleric spell Divine Power will grant you the AB of a fighter and a forth attack at your highest AB.<br><br>15 cleric lvls is enough for +5 bonus to GMW and Divine Favour. But you will only be immune to Lesser Dispel. <br><br>War domain gives Cat's Grace and Aura of Vitality, both buffing dexterity. AoV also buffes Con and Str.<br><br>Ranger will grant you dual wield and martial weapons. I still think rogue gives you more in a cleric dexer build.<br><br>Almost anything with cleric/monk will be uber: E.g. a kama wielding Cleric26/monk9/SD5 with epic dodge and HIPS <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"><br>_________________<br>The curve is more powerful than the sword<br>-- BG courtesan<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mick Dagger on 11/14/06 20:08</span></i></p>
