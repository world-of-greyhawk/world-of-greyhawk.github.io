I am looking for some suggestions for a build that is fun to play and uses at least 15 Paladin levels, gets epic dodge, at least 6 DwD, and I want him to be able to disarm traps and open locks as well, and have some paladin goodies.<br><br>I will play him in a +5/+6 world.  Levelling him should not be a problem, I don't mind xp penalties.

This comes pretty close; though the ED is missing as this one is strength based.

Well I can make a build using those parameters, I'm just not sure if it's good... I have very little experience with melee/rogue types.  Wanted to see how those experienced with this type of character would do it.<br><br>edit: That build looks good but it doesn't have any CHA.. Of course on my PW I could get +12 to CHA fairly easily.  This is just one of the questions I'm looking at, because I wanted to take advantage of being able to get +12 Cha and use divine might/shield if I'm going to be a paladin.  With 18 Cha he would get 10 rounds of divine might/shield but then his AB is worse, and it already doesn't look that good.  See what I mean?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By EROMB on 05/11/07 16:38</span></i></p>
