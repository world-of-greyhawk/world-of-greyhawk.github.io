I was surprised not to see something like this in the index of builds, as it's an exceedingly obvious build.<br>This is my variation on it, with a focus not on ac, as in many sorc builds, but on damage resistance. He gets 10/- prismatic immunity (fire /cold/ acid/ lightning/ sonic) and 9/- physical immunity. Just strap on a mestil's sheath and elemental shield and start slinging. You can bet they'll hurt far more than you for every hit landed.<br><br>Gnome<br>Lawful Good<br>STR 6<br>DEX 12<br>WIS 8<br>CON 18 (22)<br>INT 14<br>CHA 16 (22)<br><br>Here's the basic outline:<br><br>Pump Charisma to 19, then Con to 22, then all the rest into Charisma.<br><br>Skills to max (discipline only at lv 40, mind you): Concentration, Discipline, Spellcraft, Tumble<br><br>Pre-epic 18 sorc 2 PM<br>1 Combat Casting<br>3 Toughness<br>6 Empower Spell<br>9 Extend Spell<br>12 Maximize Spell<br>15 Spell Penetration<br>18 Greater Penetration<br>Post-Epic:<br>(8 pm 11 sorc 1 pali)<br>21 Improved Combat Casting<br>24 Damage Reduction I<br>27 Damage Reduction II<br>30 Damage Reduction III<br>33 Epic Spell Penetration<br>36 Epic Energy Resistance: Fire<br>39 Epic Energy Resistance: Cold<br>3 Sorcerer Feats:<br>1.

Oh and add in the PM hp... im always confused about whether that adds in like it's supposed to or not.<br><br>Pros:<br>9/- physical and 10/- prismatic, natural.<br>High hp for a caster.<br>Decent AC.<br>Immune to Criticals, Hold, Paralysis, Stun (and death magic with shadow shield)<br>Decent saves.<br>Cons:<br>Reflex is a bit low.<br><br>DCs are low. Saveless spells are your friend.<br>SR can be a problem, but primarily in the case of pure monks.<br>Here's why:<br>If they're pure caster, they can get 52 SR at most. With Mordekainen's Disjunction, this becomes 42. When you roll against SR, you take your caster level and add ten. 10+29+6(epic spell pen)=45. Therefore 100% of your spells will penetrate.<br>Now, let's say someone went 40 monk and took _five_ SR feats. Pretty nasty... 60 SR. You drop it to 50 with MD, and so you land 75% of your spells allowing SR.<br>40 monk and _ten_ SR feats? You only land 25% of your spells that allow SR. Ouch.<br>One would need an impossible 75 SR for you to not be able to penetrate. Correct me if I'm wrong, of course, but I'm pretty sure this is the case.<br>But let's think about this... how big of a threat is that monk anyways? You have beefy resistances across the board,   immunity to critical, and mestil's acid sheath/elemental shield (about 60 acid and 30 fire damage, for 58 rounds extended). Hell, remove all of your items and practically beg him to hit you ten times in a round. He'll be lucky to scratch you, and you'll be dishing out some serious reciprocal damage. A pure monk with 10 SR feats can't possibly be that scary an opponent.<br><br>Equipment to look for:<br>Charisma boosting, then Con and/or Dex boosting.<br>Damage immunity/resistance<br>non-elemental resistance (ie positive, negative..)<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/10/07 13:28</span></i></p>

You cannot gain PM levels if you are good - you have to start as LN and become LG when you get your last PM level.<br>I don't think if Epic Energy Resistance feats are really worth it, especially when you take only one of each elements - for me, these are wasted feats, spellcasters have Energy Buffer to do the trick for them. It would be copletely different if you could take Epic Energy Resistance: Magical...

Ah, whoops. Wasn't really thinking as I typed it all out. You're right, it should say LN, and naturally you'd have to go LG at 39.<br>As far as the Epic Energy Resistance, the reason they're there is so that enchanted weapons don't do damage. A lot of times weapons will have 1d6 or 2d6 of various elemental times... often multiple types, but of course that depends on the server. If you have these feats you can avoid taking much damage at all per hit. Also if you look for elemental resistance armor you can stack on top of that and soak a pretty decent chunk out of spells cast at you, especially those involving multiple blasts.<br>For me it's worth it, but as always it depends on the player and depends on the server. You could always go for maybe an Epic Reflexes, 2 Great Charisma feats, and armor skin. (You'd take improved combat casting, epic spell penetration, and maybe an epic spell with your sorc feats).<br>_________________<br>Have I mentioned I hate IGMS?

Yup most people don't like mixing pm and bard or sorcerer due to the pm not giving spells like it should with those classes. Nice idea though. I personally am not a big fan of alignment shift build, but this one isn't hopping back and forth, so it holds more merit in the rp sense.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Yeah I hate mixing myself, but in this case the only thing it affects is the caster level, which, as I pointed out, matters only in the rare case of pure monks with lots of SR feats.<br>I also dislike the alignment shift, but since it's only once, and at level 39, I'd say it's worth it, just this once.<br><br>Incidentally I thought about the feats and realized that the combat casting feats aren't really needed. First, you want to be hit with this build to deal reciprocal damage, and second, you don't get hit that hard anyways.<br>While you're at it, might as well drop out tumble so you take as many attacks of opportunity at as low of an AC as possible. It would be extremely hard to break this build's concentration.<br><br>Here's how I'd do it instead:<br>You can keep int at 14 if you want and grab whatever skill you want with it, or you can drop it to 12 and pump another stat point. I'd go with STR, personally, just to be able to carry more weight.<br><br><br>Pre-epic 18 sorc 2 PM<br>1 Toughness<br>3 Empower Spell<br>6 Extend Spell<br>9 Maximize Spell<br>12 Spell Penetration<br>15 Greater Penetration<br>18 Lightning Reflexes<br>Post-Epic:<br>(8 pm 11 sorc 1 pali)<br>21 Epic Spell Penetration<br>24 Damage Reduction I<br>27 Damage Reduction II<br>30 Damage Reduction III<br>33 Epic Energy Resistance: Fire<br>36 Epic Energy Resistance: Cold<br>39 Epic Energy Resistance: Acid<br>3 Sorcerer Feats:<br>1.
