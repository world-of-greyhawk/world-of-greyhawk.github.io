I came to the idea for this build on my own, but was interested to see quite a few really good builds that were along the same lines. The closest build to this one would be <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "223201", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Chief's Undead Bodyguard by Separ</a>.<br><br>I'm posting this one because it is the only build that combines: <br>Half-Orc<br>Barbarian(20)<br>Full BAB(30)<br>Improved Power Attack<br>Devastating Critical<br><br><b>Purpose/Theme</b><br>This is a character bred for a single purpose: To be the last one standing in any one-on-one fighter vs. fighter epic level 40 matchup. This build is optimally tweaked such that you cannot make a change in skills, abilities, feats, class levels, or race that would significantly improve the character for the purpose stated, (though there may be similarily beneficial options).<br><br>Playing high level PWs solo, or battling casters is not recommended.<br><br><b>Story</b><br>A song of awe and wonder floated through the ancient halls of the King, dancing, a world above graceful, it swam amongst the mesmerized peoples; an enchanting brilliance. The hearts of men were never touched by a lay more capturing or powerful. But for all its beauty, the music was a shadow in the light of the glorious deeds it recounted.<br><br>At the King's side, standing in righteous pose was the hero of their time. An awesome figure with an aura that resonated the epic might of a demigod. As the champion stood there and listened to the story of his heroic actions, a fierce pride was evident in his glowing face. His stature seemed to grow as the song continued, until all that was around him shrank away and diminished, and the people, friends and foes, places and histories, all sank to insignificance beneath his glory and legend.<br><br>It was there above the clouds as he flew among the notes, that he began to wake from his rapture. A slow rousing heralded faintly by a distant and unsettling discord. Subtle at first, but then growing as if in approach. And into the refrain, a weave of sorrow and regret was entwined, an unbearable weeping despair to drown the chords in a dark murk of anger and hate. From the clouds to the depths of an empty black void the champion fell, now a mask of cold terror.<br><br>A low and powerful rumble shook the ancient halls, and all memory of warmth was sapped from the world as the shadows gathered and began to shift inwards to a single point. Even before the shadow took shape, a voice was heard, terrible and woeful such that flesh would cling to bone out of demented fear, "Your end draws nigh". Inexplicably, it was known to all that these words were meant for the hero.<br><br>Shrouded in dark mist and a pale unnatural light, the figure of the dread wraith was a thing of disbelief and hysteric dreams, a sense of something that should not be. With a steady and unwavering pace, the wraith moved purposefully towards the epic champion. Those gathered in the King's hall cowered unabashedly, most unable to open their tightly shut eyes for fear of confirming the reality. The King and his most valorous knights could do <br>no better.<br><br>As the wraith drew nearer, the hero was struggling to regain control of his nerve. Riveted in place, he stared unflinchingly as death approached him. He fought away a powerful compulsion to succumb to his fear, and surrender. The dreaded wraith swiftly lifted his sword, and as the pale tinged edge made its way to the champion's neck, the hero erupted in a crazed frenzy of flurrying blows. Frantically he assailed the dread wraith with combination after deadly combination. Yet the more he attacked, the more he despaired, as every blow he tried to deal seemed only to cut through the wisps of smoke that surrounded the wraith.<br><br>The epic champion was almost on the verge of panic when he remembered himself. He remembered that at his feet had fallen the mightiest of giants and ancient dragons. In that instant the hero regained his confidence and form. He took a step back and with a deft and calculated attack he penetrated the formidable defenses of the creature and struck a direct and thunderous blow at the heart. Pulling back, he prepared to deliver a finishing blow to the wraith then immediately stopped short. With sudden alarm and horror, he realised that the creature was unscathed and unphased. He looked into the callous gloom of the <br>dread wraith's eyes, and the frayed remains of his courage dissolved and died in a silent whimper. Then with a swift and soundless cut, the head of the epic champion fell to the marble floor, bereft of pride and then blood.<br><br>As the mist and shadows dissipated, those gathered in the halls could not bring themselves to move or speak for quite some time....<br><br><br><b>Dread Wraith - Barbarian(20), Bard(4), Pale Master(16)</b><br>Half Orc, True Neutral<br>PvP, Playable Levels 1-40<br><br><b>ABILITIES</b><br>Starting (Ending)<br>STR: 20 (30)<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 15<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 10<br>CHA: 6<br><br><b>STATS</b><br><i>No Buffs</i><br>Hitpoints: 480HP Max (No Buffs)<br>Skillpoints: 140<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Reflex/Will): 24/16/15<br>Saving Throw Bonuses: +7 bonus to saves vs. spells<br>BAB: 30<br>AB: 44/39/34/29 (calculated)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor): 30/38<br><br><i>Buffed</i><br>Greater Rage, Bard Song, Epic Warding, Epic Mage Armor<br>STR 36<br>CON 21<br>Hitpoints: 596HP<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Reflex/Will): 28/16/19<br>AB: 48/43/38/33 (calculated)<br>AC with mundane armor: 56<br>Damage Reduction 50/+20 in addition to the Barbarian's Damage Reduction 4<br><br><b>SKILLS</b><br>Base Score / Modified Score / Buffed Score<br><br>Discipline  43 / 53 / 56<br>Perform     19 / 17 / 17<br>Spellcraft  35 / 35 / 35<br>Tumble      43 / 43 / 43<br><br><b>DAMAGE</b><br>Standard/Critical<br><br><i>No Buffs</i><br>Minimum: 17/35<br>Average: 22/47.5<br>Maximum: 27/60<br><br><i>Greater Rage &amp; Improved Power Attack</i><br>Minimum: 31/63<br>Average: 36/75.5<br>Maximum: 41/88<br><br>Add +2 damage with Bard Song.<br><br>Max 90 damage buffed on Overwhelming Critical with Improved Power Attack.<br>Average 183.6 damage per round with Greater Rage, Bard Song and Improved Power Attack.<br><br><b>LEVELING GUIDE</b><br>01: Barbarian(1): Heavy Armor*<br>02: Barbarian(2):<br>03: Barbarian(3): Toughness*<br>04: Barbarian(4): STR +1 (STR=21)<br>05: Barbarian(5):<br>06: Barbarian(6): Weapon Focus Greatsword<br>07: Barbarian(7):<br>08: Barbarian(8): STR +1 (STR=22)<br>09: Barbarian(9): Power Attack<br>10: Barbarian(10):<br>11: Barbarian(11):<br>12: Barbarian(12): Imp.

I like the build. A couple of things though. <br><br>I understand wanting to achieve MAX BAB by going straight Barbarian 20, but when actually playing a build from the ground up I find it difficult to not add a level or two of Bard for skill dumps pre-epic. <br><br>Also, whats the point of having CON at 15?

Alternatively, drop DEX to 8 and bump up CON to 16. -1 AC and Reflex Save (which can, theoretically, be made up for with Cat's Grace potions), vs. 40 HP, +1 Fort and one more round for your Rages.<br>_________________<br>People who say that I am arrogant are mistaken.

What gal asked though has nothing to do with that, as 14 con or 15 con end up with SAME HP.

For the 15th con, you actually loose 2 stat points.  So, for the sake of, say 2 to dex or 12 dex, which now means you dont need any more dex to get FULL ac from FP.  iirc, and it has been some time since i built a halfer.. goin to 12 int would still require 2 stats, no?  lol  dam i am rusty and used to nwn2 now..  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  <br><br>SO wouldnt it be better to leave con at 14 and bump Dex or Int?<br><br>It seems like a nice build, though i am no barbarian expert (maybe Anuis can stop by and give us his opinion).

Ok, first of all thanks to everyone who posted, I appreciate all the suggestions and improvements (quite a few).<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 02/08/09 21:37 (GMT) -- avado<br><br><b>Purpose/Theme</b><br>This is a character bred for a single purpose: To be the last one standing in any one-on-one fighter vs. fighter epic level 40 matchup. <b>This build is <i>optimally tweaked</i> such that you cannot make a change in skills, abilities, feats, class levels, or race that would significantly improve the character for the purpose stated</b>, (though there may be similarily beneficial options).<br><br><b>Playing high level PWs solo, or battling casters is not recommended.</b><br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Secondly, (and don't hate me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  ), I'm not new to internet forums. I knew <i>very</i> well that what I wrote above about my build being optimally tweaked and being the best fighter, was going to come across as an open invitation for meticulous and even harsh critique.<br>I'm not bad at building characters, but I don't compare to the combined knowledge and experience of the members of this guild.<br>So again, thanks for taking the time to look at it and prove my statements so very wrong.<br><br>Lastly, to Avado, you are of course right about the level progression. The reason my build is that way is because I don't ever play online, and I don't play through campaigns from scratch to level up a character. In fact, 90% of the time I spend in NWN is actually coming up with build ideas and testing them in modules designed specifically for level 40 characters, predominately melee tanks (but that's just me).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Angelis Dania on 02/09/09 10:07</span></i></p>

In order to deal damage you need to hit, and there's no such thing as average damage unless you're fighting only average ACs. 48 buffed AB is not bad, in fact, it's certainly quite acceptable, but after Improved Power Attack, you'll barely even hit your own build, or any other high AC build.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Sorry, my bad.

Considering all the improvements suggested above, I would change the following so far.<br><br>1. Start CON at 14.<br>2. Start INT at 12.<br>3. Take 2 Bard Levels before Level 21 (maybe at 11 &amp; 16).<br>4. Put 25 or more ranks in Intimidate.<br>6. Take Barb at 21, Bard at 22, PM at 23, and Barb at 24.<br>7. Replace Imp. PA with Blind Fight.<br>8.  Replace Epic Prowess &amp; Armor Skin with Terrifying Rage and Thundering Rage.<br>9. I'm still putting points into perform, but only 11. This gives me the "9 points and bard level 3" status (after -2 CHA Mod) for buffing.<br>10. Put 40 in Tumble and 40 in Spellcraft (now +8 vs. spells), leaving 25 points for something like Taunt or UMD (suggestions)?<br><br>Hopefully that brings the build up a notch. I think you lose 2 AB and 2 AC, but you do better critical damage without losing a further 8 AB with Imp. PA.<br>You also end up with a more rounded character which is a bit better to play from the ground up.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Angelis Dania on 02/09/09 11:39</span></i></p>

LOL  There ARE times when you can take a class straight through (i do it with clerics, no matter what the other classes are).  I feel that 20 barb will be fine to play, or 19/1bard.  To give up 3!!!  putting a pm level before 20, pm is a 1/2 bab progression, so you are really hurtin your efforts!  <br><br>I hope i didnt come off as hatin the build.  I dont.  For another lesson: for skill dumps (which is what was suggested for the 3 bard lvls) should fall on multis of 5(clv) - 3.  Why?  At creation, we get 1 (lvl) + 3 skills.  THis means that at 7, 12, 17 we get full tumble dumps (iirc tumble doesnt work with non-5 mutlis).  <br><br>THe 17barb/3bard pre is perfect for this idea.  <br><br>so, to recap!  SOmetimes straight levels IS the only way!  Sometimes it isnt!  <br><br>oh, and Angel has my vote for NICEST new builder (though she can be seen to have an ego (but who of us doesnt))!<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/28/06 00:22:49 (GMT) -- TyrTemplar<br><br>This post is for general information purposes only, and does not constitute a legal opinion or render any legal advice.
