What do you think of dropping one level of Ranger to take SD 5 so you get Defensive Roll? Your last Ranger level gives you Favored Enemy #8 - that's a lot of enemies. Maybe you could spare losing one?<br><br>I think I'd give up on using single-handed weapons and go two-handed with such a high strength. Just forget about the Ranger's Dual Wielding. I'm thinking Great Axe or Heavy Flail would go well with the build.<br><br>A note on posting, I think you should put the class feats in parentheses so they're easily distinguished from the selected feats.<br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br>Intelligent design is neither.

In the pre-epics you should move dodge and mobility feats as late as possible, to take the most useful feats as early as possible. I suggest taking KD and IKD earlier at least. Blind fight doesn't need to be moved though, since you will rarely fight concealed opponents any earlier. <br><br>This comment you knew would come, right: Fighter would be a good choice to, but your saves will suffer. It would be fun to see the damage you are capable of vs favored enemies. I don't agree with going two handed. When not fighting FE's, it would be good. When fighting FE's(and you have a lot!) your damage is superb. + 10-20 actually. More attacks with high AB is better IMO.<br><br>Why use padded. You might as well use studded, Cat Grace your dex to max 19 gives +4 dex bonus. Studded would give you 2 higher AC.<br><br>It's all minor, but you know, a point here and a point there.... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br>But Kudos to the forest Dwarf, right up my alley of characters i would like to play. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

Well, if he got the max dex bonus for his character from items, padded would be good.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:. Only those who have known darkness in<br>(OvO) their hearts will see the shadows in life...<br>(|__|)<br>..".."..

I'm really not sold on that one. Ok you get another feat, but then I have to take Wpn Spec and also fit Epic Wpn Spec in somewhere as well.... not to mention the loss to saves from Sacred Defense, and Reflex would be reduced further as CoT has Fort and Reflex as primaries.<br><br>Larger weapon? You could... but then Full Plate is a must and your Hide check would be harder as a result. From an aesthetics viewpoint it doesn't really fit the mould of a forest dweller.. down to the user I suppose. The build was put together to use Two Weapons in the main, whilst allowing a decent damage output when using single handed in those more pressing encounters, despite its small size.<br><br>Defensive Roll... again not sure, but you could certainly take it without affecting the build greatly. You would lose one FE type, but the damage output is unaffected thanks to 25 levels of Ranger taken.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 11/20/05 15:17</span></i></p>

ranger amd dwarves and rangers, oh my!<br><br>i like this build.  again showing the power that ranger builds can have.  the shadowdancer is nice, although a few more levels would really boost the power of the build.  dropping ranger to 23 and SD up to 7, for example.  but one uses what works best.<br><br>nicely done.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Perception is strong and sight weak.
