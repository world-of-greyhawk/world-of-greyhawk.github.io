MEDIEVAL ENFORCER <br>By Deborah Tyr<br><br>Concept: this is a law enforcement type character, a paladin with the power of devastating crit., having dedicated his/her life to the causes of liberty, freedom, and justice. This character is a variant on another in this series (i.e., the Law Marshall, link below); a power tweak if you will, to achieve even more AB, fort, and even a slightly better skillset (i.e., including listen). The cost? Loss of the holy sword (and other paladin spells). Without further adieu, please meet the Medieval Enforcer (as always, comments are welcome) ~ Tyr.<br><br><br>The Medieval Enforcer<br>Paladin(5), Fighter(10), Weapon Master(25)<br>Human, Lawful Good<br>Hitpoints: 480<br><br><br>FINAL STATS:<br>STR: 16 (30)<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 12<br>INT: 13 (14)<br>CHA: 8<br><br><br>Saving Throws<br>Fort: 30, +2 Protection<br>Will:  16, +2 Protection <br>Reflex: 20, +2 Protection<br><br>Saving Throw bonuses:  +3 Spells <br>Immunities: Fear, Disease<br>Mind-Effects/Mind-Spells (Protection)<br><br><br>* COMBAT VITALS<br><br>Devastating Critical: <br>DC 40 (capped, DC 46)<br>***(want more? see level guide, below)<br><br>BAB: 30, AB +50 (Sleeping)<br>+6 Taunt, +1 Divine Favor<br>--<br>Total AB: +57<br><br>Capped AB:<br>+76 (+12 STR boost &amp; Weaponry items)<br>+6 Taunt<br>--<br>AB +82 (Combat Cap), +5 Smite AB Bonus (+12 CHA)<br>--<br>Total Capped: AB +87<br>***(want more? see level guide, below)<br><br><br>Combat Damage: <br>Mundane Greatsword<br>2d6, +21 (15-20 crit./x3)<br>+1 Divine Favor<br>--<br>On a crit: instant death potential, <br>With (24-34 x’s 3) 72-102 Damage should target make their save vs. devastating critical. <br><br>Other recommendations (weapon considerations):<br>•	Greataxe, for x4 damage on a critical, with a decent crit. range<br>•	Scythe, for awesome damage on a critical (i.e., x5), but a lower crit. range<br>•	Scimitar, for awesome crit. range (more opps/insta-death), but lower overall damage<br>•	Trusty Longsword, a nice, all-around utility weapon, which also enables shield use <br><br><br>DEFENSE VITALS:<br>AC 25 (mundane plate only), +2 Protection (or, AC 27)<br>Note: a mundane shield would add +3 AC, or: AC 30 <br><br><br>FINAL SKILLS (205)<br>Discipline 43(53)<br>Heal 3(4)<br>Intimidate 4(3)<br>Listen 42(43) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">          <br>Spellcraft 13(15)<br>Taunt 43(42)<br>Tumble 20(21)<br><br><br>Spell Casting: Paladin(1)<br>To pick your spell for the Medieval Enforcer, please: <a href="http://www.gamebanshee.com/neverwinternights/spells/paladinlevelone.php#null" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br><br>WHAT FOLLOWS is the PATH of the MEDIEVAL ENFORCER during the first 40 levels of his/her career:<br><br>01: Paladin(1): dodge, weapon focus: Greatsword<br>02: Fighter(1): power attack<br>03: Paladin(2): mobility, {Smite Evil}<br>04: Fighter(2): STR+1, spring attack, (STR=17)<br>05: Fighter(3)<br>06: Fighter(4): expertise, whirlwind attack<br>07: Fighter(5)<br>08: Weapon Master(1): INT+1, weapon of choice: Greatsword, (INT=14)<br>09: Weapon Master(2): knockdown<br>10: Weapon Master(3)<br>11: Weapon Master(4)<br>12: Weapon Master(5): STR+1, improved critical: Greatsword, (STR=18)<br>13: Weapon Master(6)<br>14: Weapon Master(7)<br>15: Paladin(3): cleave<br>16: Fighter(6): STR+1, blind fight, (STR=19)<br>17: Fighter(7)<br>18: Paladin(4): great fortitude<br>19: Weapon Master(8)<br>20: Fighter(8): STR+1, weapon specialization: Greatsword, (STR=20)<br>21: Fighter(9): great cleave<br>22: Weapon Master(9)<br>23: Weapon Master(10)<br>24: Weapon Master(11): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR=22)<br>25: Weapon Master(12)<br>26: Weapon Master(13): epic weapon focus: Greatsword<br>27: Fighter(10): epic fortitude*, epic weapon specialization: Greatsword<br>28: Weapon Master(14): STR+1, (STR=23)<br>29: Weapon Master(15)<br>30: Weapon Master(16): Great Strength II, overwhelming critical: Greatsword, (STR=24)<br>31: Weapon Master(17)<br>32: Weapon Master(18): STR+1, (STR=25)<br>33: Weapon Master(19): Great Strength III, devastating critical: Greatsword, (STR=26)<br>34: Weapon Master(20)<br>35: Weapon Master(21)<br>36: Weapon Master(22): STR+1, Great Strength IV, armor skin* (STR=28)<br>37: Weapon Master(23)<br>38: Weapon Master(24)<br>39: Weapon Master(25): Great Strength V, epic prowess, (STR=29)<br>40: Paladin(5): STR+1, (STR=30)<br><br><br>POWER OPTION?

Just a couple notes (&amp; a couple corrections, too (PM sent, and will be changed proper, but should puts here too, yes? (sorry, folks): <br><br>1. first, as to the power option (totally last minute twist, late at night and last minute thing, while tryin' to beat the time for posting clock thing (sorry folks); anyway, should read: drop great fort and bump great cleave up in its stead, then when hit epic, take great strength (in the place of great cleave) and yer other great strength in lieu of epic fort; this will net you 2 more str in the end (thus, +1 AB &amp; damage (or, unbuffed AB +51 with a dev crit DC 41 (capped: +77 AB, and DC 47): cost, -6 fort which I actually wouldn't recommend, since it's a sure bet that where dev crit's allowed, others can dev crit, too...<br><br>2. the smite thing, when it's brought to cap, as in +12 cha, should also read +5 and not +4 (for a grand total as follows: combat cap: AB +76 (add one if take power option), +5 Smite bonus (cha capped), then adds in yer taunt +6 (if ya takes it), for a total adjusted: AB 87 (that'd be 88 with the power option) ...<br><br>Those familiar with my Bard blade series might be askin' well, why not do here what you did over there, as in ie., bring in a pally or two at the end. A fair question it would be, but decided against it least of all b/c I don't like copying stuff (not even me own stuff <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">              Real reason though was playability: the saves, will in partic., having pally immunity to fear and disease helps. It's particularly helpful from the beginning, and not in the end. Also, not much point in waiting 'til the end to bring on pally as they don't get anything close to the bard's pay load in terms of skill dump (as in, no UMD access, or ability to max tumble, or ..., so nothing much to make the wait really worthwhile, ya know?) Plus, need at least two level pally for the aura of courage (fear immunity), and pally 5 for the spell . . .<br><br>When all is said and done, though, must admit I much prefer the Marshall, who has his holy sword (and other great spells); even though Enforcer's stats are +2 AB over Marshall (+3 if go power option), this one seems rather, well, bland without at least the holy sword, doesn't s/he? Once you strip it all down, well . . . . Still, if you're wanting a tank (with at least some pally for playability and RP factor, then ... Hey, it's a pally (sorta <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">              And it's got dev. crit. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">             <br><br>Update: I've another one coming, as noted, which will finish off this law giver/law enforcer series, but gona take a bit of a break from pallys for awhile. I know, I promised a pally/druid or druid/dragon type, but gonna bring out something else, a cleric combo (hey, Tyr likes em clerics, too (right, Avado? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">              )Nots to worry, you'll gets yer druid type but tons of stuff to work out yet on that one (the sheet, we know it lies, but druid/shifters, egads, the sheet's just so wrong as to be beyond frustrating). <br><br>Stay tuned, folks: got a nice cleric combo coming up; yeppers, something for everyone coming up <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 07/31/06 03:38</span></i></p>
