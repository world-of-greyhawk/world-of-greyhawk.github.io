As a minimum then you'll need Rogue 13 for both Improved Evasion and Defensive Roll. I'd drop the extra level into Bard, just for the improvement to Bard/ Curse Song.

I'd drop Dex to 16 and start with INT 14 and CON 14 for the extra HP, Skills and +2 Fort Save, but it depends how early you want Epic Dodge

The trouble is with this split is the necessity to have decent DEX, with a CHA of 16 (for 6th level Bard Spells), whilst also maintaining a decent value in STR, CON &amp; INT.<br><br>Curse Song, Weapon Finesse, Improved Evasion, Defensive Roll, Epic Dodge would be must have feats. <br><br>The only other downside is the number of attacks per round, in this case it is only 3, unless hasted or using two weapons. The latter option burns a further 3 feats, so already the build becomes a little feat starved.<br><br>Base AB will not be high, due to the concentration of your abilities across 5 of the 6.<br><br>Personally I would go rogue rather than Shadowdancer in this type, purely because you burn a further two feats (Dodge and Mobility) to qualify. You also have a better skill set and Sneak Attack to make up for the lack of damage output, which you will have.<br><br>I'll have a look at this some more when I have time.

Where's your damage comnig from with this build? I'd probably opt for Rogue for the sneak attack damage. Make sure you pick up KD and perhaps IKD so you can generate some sneaks.<br><br>As for Lasting Inspiration: I love it. Bard Song that lasts 100 rounds? Yes, please.<br>_________________<br>Where I'm playing now: <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk.</a>

the trouble is you need 13 rogue for Epic Dodge, 10 rdd for the stat boost, leaving only 17 for Bard, which is not enough for LI.

Well, you don't really <i>need</i> all 10 RDD levels. If you take only 7 levels, you still get +2 AC, +4 STR, and +2 CON. Also, you could forego Epic Dodge if you wanted...<br>_________________<br>Where I'm playing now: <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk.</a>
