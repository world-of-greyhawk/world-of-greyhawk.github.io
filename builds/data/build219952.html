I like the build.  I built a Pally Monk WM that was frustrating to the nth degree.  This looks less frustrating, easier to play.  Here's what I'd change (since you asked <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  )<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 11/11/05 07:37:49 (GMT) -- christian.schnabel<br><br>STR 10<br>DEX 16 to 30<br>CON 14<br>WIS 15 to 18<br>INT 10<br>CHA 10<br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>I'd ditch two of the three GR WIS feats and up your DEX since it has AB/AC consequences:<br><br>STR 10<br>DEX 16 to 32<br>CON 14<br>WIS 15 to 16 <br>INT 10<br>CHA 10<br><br>You spend two feats on Wisdom that you could spend on Great Dexterity by switching two of the CoT feats spent on GrWis to take two of EWF, EP, or AS on the CoT feats, take GrDex on the normal feats.

You are welcome.<br><br>I am trying to learn before I go on another posting spree and find that analyzing other peep's builds, giving my two cents, and getting their feedback is very helpful.<br><br>On the Wisdom/Dex/Holy Avenger deal, I think having holy avenger on your main kama (six attacks/round, seven with haste) will be fine, greater magic weapon on the other for those two attacks.  And if you get any wisdom-boosting equipment and can cast two level 4 spells, you may find that death ward is more useful than having that second kama all buffed up with Holy Avenger.  Or maybe you could have two fights with your main kama buffed.  <br><br>By a ratio of 3:1 the buffing on your main kama is much more important.<br><br>Cheers, C, both are good builds.

The posted AB is right, his dex is 30, which gives +10.<br><br>A cheap trick PvP is using your speed so you are hard to target for mages, then slam them up and get out. This class spread keeps your saves good throughout the build to, which means much in most settings. It's a well planned dex-kama-dualer. We have seen that before, but you have neither fighter nor WM in this, still good AB, of course good AC and nice saves. Well planned, well built. As always.
