The big thing is that WM doesn't really seem to benefit the build as much as it costs it.  You lose more than a little AB (since you have a relatively low ending dex for a dex build and haven't got room for epic prowess) and have to put off two-weapon fighting for over half of your career in return for improving the critical hit stats of a weapon (kama) with the worst natural crit stats in the game (20 x2).<br><br>In most regards it really looks as though you'd be better off using COT instead of WM.  It would be more realistically playable, and end up more effective all around.

Thanks for the format help. Its my first post/first build so I had no idea it existed. <br><br>As for the waste in weapon master, I suppose you may be right. I might want to change that out for something else. I suppose I could check out that COT. <br><br>I made this build pitting it solely against monsters that were available in the game or against monsters that I made with the tool set. As such, I have no experience fighting real human players. <br><br>Your remark about the kama having some of the lowest critical hit abilities is actually wrong. The maximum percentage for critical hit chance with a scimitar is 55% with a x3 as I believe. His maximum with kamas is about 25% as i believe with x3. However, he gets about twice as many attacks as a scimitar wielding character. 25% of 8 attacks is about the same as 55% of 4. As such, I have calculated that his critical hits in a single round are about the same as a maximimum scimitar wielding weapon master. This said, he could use devastating critical to great effect, but I wanted to try for defense rather than offense. <br><br>As to the enemies with immunities, you are right. I haven't had that much trouble however with undead, elementals, or constructs however as he can simply wear them down in time. <br><br>Is that true what you say about parry? The skill description said that I could parry as many attacks per round as I have. I have used it and it didn't seem all that bad. <br><br>That said though, perhaps you are right about WM. I probably should exchange that. (Its only real use is, like I said, with high damage enhancement kamas).<br><br>Oh, yes, and his spell resistance is not that high at all. Its only real use is against people who use very small amounts of spellcasting (like ten or so levels).<br><br>Also, depending on how powerful kamas are in the area, he may want to use unarmed strike (natural 1-20, +3 enhancement).<br><br>Finally, his saves are<br><br>Fort 21<br>Reflex 34<br>Will 18 (but complete immunity to mind spells and effects)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Dark Centurion on 12/19/05 20:57</span></i></p>

Also, I forgot to mention that this build is not actually meant to be a very great offensive weapon. I meant for the sneak attacks to let him get by in the low magic worlds and critical hits to get him by in high magic worlds. <br>The real idea of this character is actually to be defensive. And he does so on a very wide scale. From dragon warriors to demiliches, he can withstand much more of a beating than most other characters. He also does so on the run, without having to spend more than about three seconds buffing up. UMD helps him with certain odds and ends in both areas.

true enough, the build seems pretty solid, but I do question the need for WM in it. I'm really thinking of the feats required to take it, and after all you only take 7 levels. Do you really need all of these otherwise? Dodge, Mobility, Expertise, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack and Weapon Focus. Sure maybe 2 or 3.<br><br>CoT springs to mind as Xylo pointed out. Thinking about going that route then drop Rogue to 10 maybe and take 10 CoT - your saves, HP and AB may well benefit greatly, without any sacrifice to your AC. Not to mention the possibility of Great WIS through the CoT in epic levels.<br><br>Just a few thoughts.

With uncanny dodge, wisdom is not necessary for this build. <br>I agree with both of you that WM is a bad idea. COT however does not appeal to me very well. I was thinking about trying Dwarven Defender instead. Any tips for that?

Sigh, and I thought I was good at this. <br><br>Oh well, I have since reformed this build, dumping weapon master and using dwarven defender in its place. The build seems to have perked up a bit. So, despite the slight bruise to my ego. I am all the better for it. Constructive Critisism I believe its called. I thank you for it. <br><br>(Also, I am sorry that I messed up the rules for posting, moderators, but this is my first and I didn't see the rules.

Sigh, yet again my invincible genius has been foiled by people who are much smarter than me. I tried Monk 20 /DwD 10 / Rogue 10 and it turned out better. I got epic prowess and blind fight, about 50 extra HP, and 6 points of damage reduction. It was a much better build than my original fiasco, but I just remembered that COT gets extra fighter-esce feats. With at least four extra feats, I could increase my Dex heavily. As such, I believe that I will follow the advise of Samphus for the leveling guide (makes a lot of sense) and see what I can do with that. And yes, I may want to start another build for that. <br><br>By the ways, if anyone is interested in working on the dwarven defender / monk / rogue idea, then what I found out was that it did maximize on defense, but it centered more on absorbing hits rather than evading them. Of course, you guys probably knew that already. I like the idea of evading, but if anyone wants to follow up on that idea, it was a pretty good build idea. I think.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Dark Centurion on 12/20/05 20:58</span></i></p>
