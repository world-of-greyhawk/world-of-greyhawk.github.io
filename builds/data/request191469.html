I have given up on my blackguard, as he really does not seem to be able to compete with any of the other more powerful builds on the server. However, can anyone provide me with a level 30 sorcerer build? With a subrace I can get +4 to charisma, so he could have a LOT of spells. I have a few limitations though: If I multiclass I must take a least 5 levels in the class. Does anyone have any ideas of what I could do, any maybe what feats I should use?

Here's a very rough outline:<br><br>If you have to take a minimum of 5 levels to multiclass and you're limited to 30 levels, I'd go pure sorcerer.  For the most part, the best multiclasses with sorcerer that involve taking more than 1 or 2 levels of your other class(es) don't really fully mature until they hit level 40, and a level 30 version of those IMHO would be weaker than if you just went pure sorcerer.  Go human, for the extra feat and skill points.  Get the spell penetration/greater spell penetration feats and spell focus/greater spell focus of your choice (evocation or necromancy for example), also Maximize, Empower, and possibly Extend.  You may want to get something like still spell or silent spell as well just in order to take up more spell slots with some of your favorite spells by shifting them up a few levels.  Toughness would be nice too.  For Epic feats, get epic spell penetration and epic spell focus of your choice.  Then you can get your Epic spells as well.  Should be quite effective (pure mages generally are).<br><br>Steve<br><br>Edit: Just noticed you mentioned a specific subrace, in which case ignore the human part (unless it's a human subrace, <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> ).  +4 to CHA for a sorc build is worth losing one feat and one skill point per level.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 04/20/05 23:37</span></i></p>

Thanks for the reply. Do you think I should try to get the automatic still spells? And what should I put my ability scores in? Oh, and the subrace is based off human, and the charisma bonus is represented as a permanent +4 constitution buff, so I will still be using human, and still be getting the extra feat.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By OMGZERGRUSHWTF on 04/20/05 23:43</span></i></p>

If you are following my pure sorc suggestion, I would not get the auto still spells.  You don't have any armor proficiencies, and don't have the spare feats to get them.  Plus, you won't be able to get as many epic spells if you do.<br><br>As for ability scores, without knowing if there are any ability penalties related to the subrace you mentioned, i can't give you exact numbers, but I would max out CHA, and have at least...12 INT, 12 CON, 12 DEX, 10 STR...pump CON and then DEX higher if you can, but you shouldn't need more than 10 STR.  WIS can be 8.  If you tell me the full attribute bonuses and penalties for the subrace you are referring to, I can give you the exact numbers I would use.<br><br>Steve

Subrace gives absolutely no penalties, it just gives a permanent +4 constitution magical buff.

Why do I get still spell and silent spell if I don't get automatic still spells? I don't understand...

The nice thing about silent/still spell is that, aside from their main purpose, a stilled or silent spell gets memorized as one level higher than normal.  That's the same thing that Extend Spell does, but you can't extend most damage spells (there's nothing to extend).  So, having still spell allows you to use many more spell slots on some of your more powerful spells.  For example, you can fill all your 6th level spell slots with Isaac's Greater Missile Storm, your 7th level spots with Stilled Isaac's Greater Missile Storm, your 8th level spots with Empowered Isaac's Greater Missile Storm, and your 9th level spots with Maximized Isaac's Greater Missile Storm.  Now, you probably wouldn't spend ALL those spell slots that way, but having either Still Spell or Silent Spell, along with Empower and Maximize,  gives you more flexibility in how you can use your spell slots.  For that reason alone, taking Still Spell is useful even if you aren't taking the Auto Still feats.  Note though that I suggested Still Spell <b>or</b> Silent Spell.  I would definitely not take both.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 04/21/05 03:18</span></i></p>

As for stats (sorry, I missed that part of your post earlier), in your first post you said it was +4 to Charisma, but now you are saying it's +4 for Con.  So, I'll give you my stats for each case.  Note that the stats are giving you do <b>not</b> include the +4 bonus, as I assume that won't get applied to your character until after you create it.<br><br>If it's a +4 to CHA:<br><br>STR 8<br>DEX 12<br>CON 14<br>WIS 8<br>INT 12<br>CHA 18 (+4 makes 22)<br><br>If it's a +4 to CON:<br><br>STR 10<br>DEX 12<br>CON 12 (+4 makes 16)<br>WIS 8<br>INT 12<br>CHA 18<br><br>That's what I would do if I wanted to keep the DCs of my spells as high as possible.<br><br>Steve

Depends on your PW really.. generally Epic Mage Armor is a must have for mages.. I guess if you're pure 30 sorc the dragon thingy would soak few IGMS for you.. I dislike the majority of the offensive epic spells as they seem to pale compared to IGMS &gt;_&lt;<br><br>-DaMouse

Unfortunately you can't get epic warding with only 30 levels.  I'd take Epic Mage Armor for sure.  If you want, you can take Greater Ruin or Hellball, but DaMouse is right...the direct damage epic spells aren't so hot.  You'll have 7 epic feats total including sorcerer bonus feats.  Your Charisma will end odd too...Honestly, I'd just take Epic Mage Armor, Greater Ruin, Epic Spell Focus of your choice, Epic Spell Penetration, and then just 3 great CHA feats.  You can do it like this:<br><br>Level 21 - Great Charisma I<br>Level 23 - Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor<br>Level 24 - Great Charisma II<br>Level 26 - Epic Spell Penetration<br>Level 27 - Great Charisma III<br>Level 29 - Epic Spell Focus (your choice, probably Evoc or Necro)<br>Level 30 - Epic Spell: Greater Ruin<br><br>By the way, I think for the spell focus feats, I'd probably end up taking Necromancy.  A lot of the most useful and powerful Evocation spells (Ice Storm, Isaac's Greater Missile Storm, the Bigby spells) don't have saving throws, but focusing on Necromancy will give you very nice DCs on your Finger of Death, Horrid Wilting, and Wail of the Banshee.<br><br>Steve
