Where I say Int, see Int/Cha depending on mage type, Cha for sorerer/bard, Int for Wiz<br><br>First off; get focus in concentration; ditch combat casting unless you plan to go for improved combat casting.<br>Second; Dont Get High Str.  You don't need it.<br>Third; Dont Wear Heavy Armor.  You don't need it.  Blowing 4 feats to cast in it is a waste; you could get epic focus or 4 grt int feats instead.<br>Fourth; get Maximize, Empower, and Extend, and make sure you USE THEM, as most folks ignore their usefulness.<br>Fifth; DO get epic spells.  Most importantly, get epic warding (yes, low hp soak, yaddayadda.  You can cast right into the enemy's face with it on, if your damage shields are up they will take easy 80hp for your few damage points taken).<br>Sixth; DO get all-or-near-as-dernit 10 Great Int/Cha feats.  They will help when you have to fight that high-save ubermeister.<br>Seventh; Epic Spell Focus in at least one school.  Necromancy is good; enchantment is better, depending on your saves and environment.<br>Eighth Do get Epic Spell Penetration.<br>Last, try to get a few levels of Bard.  You can get Discipline and umd to healthy levels, and some skills via Song.  Or Rogue, up to you.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 04/25/05 14:35</span></i></p>
