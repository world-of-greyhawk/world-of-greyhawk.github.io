Hey, I'm looking for a build that can get the best possible saves and skills. Alignment changes can't be done, so the only thing that came to mind was 30 Bard / 10 CoT. Skills in mind are Spellcraft, Discipline, Tumble, Hide, Move Silently, Persuade, Bluff, Listen, and spot sounds good for now. Not so concerned about the will save as much as the Fort and Ref saves. What do you suggest?

Before I could suggest anything..what exactly is the purpose of this? Is it for solo/group? Do you want to melee/range/cast/party support etc

Since it's for RP, I'll have to ask two more questions; what lvl ranges are you looking for in the build? 1-20, 1-40 etc, and as far as leveling goes is it tough to level? if so I'll keep that in mind so there isn't excessive skill dumps etc

Skill dumps are cool <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   Level range is 1-40, although getting up there takes quite a while

Looks pretty good! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   Thanks!<br>I'm actually not looking for anything combat related thought <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  How PvP works in the server I'm on right now, is some crazy turn based thing involving skill rolls and what not, so I was looking for something with much better skills to him. Mostly Discipline and Tumble are the big ones. I don't really need to get into the details <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  I just want to have a basic build up of the best way to get high skills and saves. 36 Bard / 4 BG sounds good, but I think for where I'm at it should have a lot more charisma and less strength for better saves <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Endalyor on 03/12/09 00:11</span></i></p>

Well, without knowing too much about how things work where you play, I'll just give a few suggestions then; instead of +1 str/4 lvls try con, great strengths replace those with great charismas and the 2 bonus feats could be used for great charismas as well if you're not interested in epic skill focuses.<br><br>This is based off the assumption more health is better whenever you fail rolls etc <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

If you're up for the option, dragon shape with its high stats is often used for both high saves and skills.  While int and cha skills are not improved, the rest are immensely, plus the beast is fight worthy.

As a guild, we are often pretty cerebral.  We dont have an RP section to make up amazing stories.  All we do is make builds and share ideas.<br><br>BUT, like Thax points out, we DO have endaylor!  I remember last year he made something like 3 requests for this type of bizarre build in ONE WEEK!  He is sort of like our new builder hazer... UNOFFICIALLY, of course.  <br><br>Rev, just so you know, you got some crazy build skills, but dont spend much time on endaylor's requests.  He seems to really have no idea, or interest, in learning about the classes.  He'll just ask for some crazy thing and then move on.   Just read the way he posts.<br><br>Glad to see you back endy.  iirc, this is your longest thread.

It was pointed out to me once that in order to utilize the level 30 bardsong you will need some pretty heavy skill-increasing items in addition to epic skillfocus perform. You may take greater benefit from only 26 levels in bard if such items are unavailable in your setting, leaving you 10 levels in another class to round things out a little.
