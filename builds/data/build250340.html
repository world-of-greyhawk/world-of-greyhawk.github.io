This is my attempt at a str-based, dev-crit, unarmed strike monk with some extra damage.  I'm concerned about many facets of this build and could use some help.<br><br>I'm worried mainly about it's HP, AC, and lack of blind fight.  I could take blind fight or toughness at level 1.  Or I could switch to Human, end up with lower str, and get blind fight and toughness, but I'm not sure about these.<br><br>I'm also not sure about which rog specialties to take.<br><br>Fist O' Death	<br>Monk9/Ass10/Rog21	<br>Playable 1 - 40	<br>PvM	<br>Alignment: Lawful Evil	<br>~ 300 HP at 40	<br><br>Race	Half-Orc<br>Str	18<br>Dex	14<br>Con	12<br>Wis	14<br>Int	10<br>Cha	6<br>	<br>Fortitude:	21<br>Reflex:	29<br>Will:	22<br>Spell Resist:	0<br>	<br>Naked AC:	25<br>Naked AB:	38<br>	<br>Tumble:	40<br>Discipline:	43<br>Hide:	10<br>Move Silently:	8<br>Spellcraft:	??<br>Open Lock:	42<br>Concentration:	43<br><br>Level	Class	Feat	Ability<br>1	Monk1	Luck of Heroes	<br>2	Monk2		<br>3	Monk3	Dodge	<br>4	Monk4		Str + 1<br>5	Monk5		<br>6	Monk6	Mobility	<br>7	Monk7		<br>8	Monk8		Str + 1<br>9	Assassin1	Weapon Focus: Unarmed Strike	<br>10	Assassin2		<br>11	Assassin3		<br>12	Assassin4	Power Attack	Str + 1<br>13	Assassin5		<br>14	Assassin6		<br>15	Assassin7	Great Cleave	<br>16	Assassin8		Str + 1<br>17	Assassin9		<br>18	Assassin10	Improved Critical: Unarmed Strike	<br>19	Rogue1		<br>20	Rogue2		Str + 1<br>21	Rogue3	Epic Weapon Focus: Unarmed Strike	<br>22	Rogue4		<br>23	Rogue5		<br>24	Rogue6	Overwhelming Critical: Unarmed Strike	Str + 1<br>25	Rogue7		<br>26	Rogue8		<br>27	Rogue9	Great Str 1	<br>28	Rogue10	Slippery Mind	Str + 1<br>29	Rogue11		<br>30	Rogue12	Devastating Critical: Unarmed Strike	<br>31	Rogue13	Defensive Roll	<br>32	Rogue14		Str + 1<br>33	Rogue15	Great Str 2	<br>34	Rogue16	Improved Sneak Attack I	<br>35	Rogue17		<br>36	Rogue18	Epic Prowess	Str + 1<br>37	Rogue19	Improved Sneak Attack II	<br>38	Rogue20		<br>39	Rogue21	Armor Skin	<br>40	Monk9		Str + 1

The thing about Assassin in NWN (aside from its bugginess) is that the DC of the save against Death Attack is based on your class level.  The upshot of this is that, against builds like this with less than ~25 levels of Assassin, your opponents will only ever be paralyzed by rolling a 1 on their saves.  I don't think a 5% chance on paralysis on the first sneak attack of every fight which hits, unless your opponent wins initiative (or something like that) is worth the 10 levels you've poured into the class.<br><br>I'd probably rather go with 4 more Rogue levels (+2d6 sneak damage and a bonus feat, along with some skill points) and 6 levels of fighter, to get you an additional attack and +1 AB, along with EWS for +6 damage.  If you have another idea for a 3rd class, though, there are lots of other good options; I just don't think Assassin is one of them in this case.<br><br>You could also consider replacing the Rogue levels with Assassin and try to get a Death Attack DC in the 35-40 range, so that it's actually useful.
