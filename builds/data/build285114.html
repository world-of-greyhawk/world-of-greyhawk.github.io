is a build that is quite popular on my PW, and routinely destroys my exalted sorc build.  i'm new to casting pvp, so it may just be my quickbar skills, but this build appeals to me as a more versatile character than an exalted sorc. those players with this type of build have not been forthcoming about their feat selection and initial stat distribution, so I am attempting to work out my own version.  first, a few words about my PW.  weapons with AB 15 are available, but difficult to obtain and are artificially limited via DM spawns.  there are many higher CR monsters around, making exploring certain regions difficult for even parties of 4 level 40 players.  what i've arrived at, is that at least for my PW, an AC caster is still going to be brought down quickly.  my concept here is to be a viable caster for caster v. caster pvp, and also to outlast fighters with spam KD.  they are eventually going to need to take a break from wailing on your damage shields to chug a heal, at which point you will escape with gsanc, and bigby's grasping them.<br><br>gnome, lawful neutral<br><br>STR: 6<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 20<br>WIS: 10<br>INT: 10<br>CHA: 16 (34)<br><br>Hitpoints: 444<br>Skillpoints:

one variation would be going 10 dex and 8 wiz to boost the reflex save a little at the expense of the already high will save.

Out of curiousity, how does this build beat an Exalted Sorcerer? The only difference seems to be PM for Monk and that just adds crit immunity which wouldn't be an issue for a caster like the Exalted. Seems like Monk's Evasion would cause some trouble for a caster's Evocation. There is still Necromancy of course, but it still seems handy.

I'm not an expert on this sort of build but, why is the one level of Paladin delayed until level 40? Wouldnt it be more helpful earlier in the build? I dont see a Discipline dump in your skill spread. Your build looks pretty good. Though, I believe the Exalted Sorceress can cast with full plate armor on. I dont remember much of that build. Hopefully someone else can offer you more advice.

doing a bit more research, it seems that<br><br>* spell focus, greater spell focus, and epic spell focus: evocation have no effect whatsoever on the Bigby line of spells. *<br><br>please correct me if i'm wrong.<br><br>in that case, another variation on the build would be to go SF, GSF, and ESF necromancy.<br><br>against melee opponents will lower will saves, i would use empowered NEB to do between 5 to 10 str damage (thus raising the effective DC of bigby's forceful by 2 to 5) in conjuction with bigby's forceful, or more likely, bigby's crushing or grasping.
