This isn't much help to you, but I wouldn't worry about that. Enjoy your character read all about the feats before you select one, and make sure that it fits the way you want to play. But i will suggest that take some to get wepaon focus feats and whatnot, that way your not a completely weak spellcaster.

Umm, now for real advice: <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   check the build page for casters.  I'd start with the pure wizard build.. i dont remember the name or builder, but that will give you a good idea.  Then read the builds with wiz in build titles..  id stay away from wiz/pms for now cuz alot of them are melee variants.  <br><br>If you dont want to do all that!  LOL  the best thing to do is to make a 30wiz/10 pm type thing.  Going to 16pm isnt necessary with a caster as most of us use 16pm to get epic warding with a melee pc.  <br><br>For feats and stats and such, find a build you like and work with it.  ITs the way we all learnd<br><br>Peace

And one thing to keep in mind about the Pale Master class: it gives you extra castings per day and access to higher levels spells (if you don't already get 9th levels spells from your wizard levels), but it does <b>not</b> add to your caster level.  So, durations, damage, spell penetration checks, etc. will all be based on your wizard level only.  Hence avado's suggestions for a wizard heavy build (or at least, one of the reasons for them).<br><br>Steve

just a few levels of monk in there bumps up the AC quite a bit (wis-modifier and tumble) and with just 4 levels pre-epic you get another BAB attack (11/6/1), so basically you are only 3AB behind a pure monk. In addition to this you get a number of neat feats that fit well for someone that want to be an un-armoured caster (deflect arrows and evasion just to mention 2 of them).
