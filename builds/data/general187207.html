How do you guys do it? <br><br>I level them 1-40 in the Novice to Epic Character Maker which takes quite a while. If mistakes are made, I have to de-level and re-level.<br><br>Is there a program that allows you to change the stats in a pre-existing build if you wanted to?

I would imagine that you would get as many answers as there are builders.<br><br>Personally I usually think on the concept first, this could be a roleplay concept ,or a request from someone or be an idea to mix classes. <br><br>I then like to work it out on paper what feats I would like to try and fit in adjusting as I go. Then I take a spreadsheat and decide on a priority of skills. I actually work backwards with this IE i choose the skills I want to max one at a time then see how to fit the skills in. <br><br>Once thats done I start by trialling the build through SoU and HotU or sometimes just HotU if im familiar with the start.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

Cool. Thanks.<br><br>I was also thinking just in terms of, for example, you give a pc 11 wisdom by mistake and you want to correct it without having to redo the build.<br><br>Is their a haking program out there that lets you do this?

French lesson, french book...<br><br>I just pick something random.. like 30 blackguard was one of my weirdest ideas I must admit.. but then I sit there scribble for the hours lesson.. <br><br>Mouse's How-To Make A Build During French<br><br>sometimes turns out good.. I find the best builds are those that you accidentily see a small bit of potential and build on it rather than millions of years of meditation (sp)<br><br>-DaMouse

I tend to think of a concept or a list of "things I want at level 40".  Then I think of how this can be achieved best (classes/race), then I load up halls of advanced training and do a quick scouting build followed by a real one using the mistakes from the scouting build as pointers on the second version.

Scouting is fine, testing is key in the end. You can't really just whip it from paper to real PVP without testing and finding the weak spots to try and fill.<br><br>-DaMouse

I generally blitz it and skip HP and only maximize skills when needed to scout them. See the feats work, classes work.. what AB/saves etc.<br><br>-DaMouse
