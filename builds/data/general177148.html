Hehe, hello everyone!<br><br>Thanks for accepting me in to your guild, I look foward to having fun here.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>You may not see me as much in here as in the NWN General Discussion, because I tend to chime in when I see something most people don't or when I can be of help and you all appear to be very good at building characters.<br><br>I will never presume to be an authority on anything because I believe there is <b>always</b> more to learn, but if I can be of assistance, I'll do my best.  <br><br>I look forward to getting to know all of you that don't know me.<br><br>~Terra~<br>_________________<br>When I am working on a problem I never think about beauty. <br>I only think about how to solve the problem. <br>But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong.
