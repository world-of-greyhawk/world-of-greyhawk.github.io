First I would like to say Syrath, your builds have spoiled me. I never saw the point of SC V until I played one of your builds in PvP. Lets just say that I'm converted. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif"> <br><br>Now for the question. What class mix would anyone suggest if I was looking for the most attacks possible while still retaining Epic Dodge and SC V? <br><br>Thanks,<br>Entropy<br>_________________<br>It's not a bad partnership.

Well the primary route to take would be somethign along the lines of an exploit eddie build to abuse monk attack rate. Barring using that, a mix of fighter (or other class that gains one BAB per level)/rogue (or shadow dancer) levels would be the next route. You need to definately have shadow dancer or rogue in the build though to be able to get epic dodge. Rogue needs 13 levels invested while SD needs 10 to get teh prereq feats.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Awesome guys, thank you. Im working on it now, going to go monk/fighter/sd, was thinking about monk/ranger/sd for the dual wield and Improved Two Wep Fighting. Thought about it for a while and I really dont see the point of taking less than 21 levels of ranger. <br><br>So thanks again and hopefully (if I cant find any like it) I will be posting it here.<br><br>~E~<br>_________________<br>It's not a bad partnership.

Mmm interesting. I know that unlike SC, improved invis is dispellable, however other than that, they both offer 50% concealment. Are there any other undocumented differences? <br><br>I have a Rogue/Cleric/SD with Epic Dodge and Impr invis and dispite his meager AC of 51, he rarely gets touched in battle.

In many situations improved invisibility offers the same as SC5, however in some of the tests i ran with SC5 the fights would often run into durations where improved invisibility would have dropped multiple times. Also this means you have to be a caster, some people (like me) just dont like playing casters. <br><br>Syrath
