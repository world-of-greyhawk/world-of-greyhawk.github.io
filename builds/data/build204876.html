<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 .PvM</b><br><br>I saw many comments at the public forums asking about rangers and most of them criticizing it.<br><br>I took a look at the pro/cons of the class... In my opinion if you want to go dex-based (A strength based ranger with full plate, shield and sword should work too, despite the fact that he doesn't look like a ranger) multiclassing is almost a must, you lack damage and uncanny dodge.

Nice build.  I'm not up on the board-speak you're referring to, but rangers to me are broadly under-represented in terms of epic builds.  I think there are a lot of reasons, but I'll hold off on that front. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>As I look through this, I'm wondering why Assassin.  You get UMD &amp; Tumble, some trap/lock stuff, and a low sneak attack.  I'm wondering whether you'd be better off going Monk, leveraging flurry of blows (more hits will probably get better damage output), and possibly even going 30/4/6 for KD/IKD.  You also get add'l feats like Cleave for free and WIS bonus for AC, and if you go Rg16/Mk4 pre-epic, your saves will be much better as well.  I did a R22/C12/Mk6 build a long time ago, and the damage output was very decent once everything added up and got to 11 attacks/rd.  Yours will probably be better average output, because it will be more consistent w/ Fighter feats, etc.<br><br>I would also say STR is a better way to go than DEX, particularly as you have Tb.  Given damage output is low to begin with, going DEX only makes it more so.<br><br>Anyway, just a thought.  Nice work.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By jjellison on 07/20/05 14:22</span></i></p>

QUOTE<br><br>Spell Casting: Ranger(2)<br>//I dont find anything useful on 3rd and 4th ranger spells, 2 is good enough for getting cat's grace and a few useful skill buffs (camouflage/one with the land).<br><br>END QUOTE<br><br>While it is true that the Ranger has some pretty useless spells, it just depends on how you apply them.

It also depends on how low magic a world is. Most worlds have belts of agility and these give out freedom for free. About the magic fang, I do prefer the 1AB +1AC +1hide/stealth/unlock/set trap than it. Anyway, it is possible to get those by trading the 2 great dex for 2 great wis or starting with 14 wis and forgeting about... unlock, untrap, umd and a few points on craft trap. Anyway, you can always use a wand or scroll (thanks to UMD <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> ).<br><br>This character isn't on the whole line of the epic character builds, he is a bit item dependant, but if played properly (a tactic stealth fighter) he can take down incredibly powerful foes (This isnt my idea but I loved it when someone told me: Place 30 epic traps in the same place, lure the powerful boss there, watch him fall diced, sliced, exploded... kill his minions with your fighting skills and your companion).<br>_________________<br>HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh.
