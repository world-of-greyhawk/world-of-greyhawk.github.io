I was thinking on the best build that could support the front line tanks and still provide some much needed firepower from a distance.  If cornered s/he should also be fast and have a decent AC.  I looked and could not find a simaler build on the first few pages where levels had to be listed in the subject.<br><br>Human CN   Barbarian 4 - Bard 16 - Cleric 20<br><br><br>Gear: Medium armor, and crossbow (prefered)<br>      Medium armor, tower shield, and simitar (rare)<br>      Cleric Dom: Trickery and Str<br><br>Str 14<br>Dex 10<br>Con 8<br>Wis 16 (28)<br>Int 10<br>Cha 16<br><br>All stats in Wis plus 2 greater wis<br><br>L1  Bb Zen Archery / Wep Focus X-Bow (heavy)<br>L2  Cl<br>L3  Cl Extend Spell<br>L4  Bd<br>L5  Bd<br>L6  Cl Still Spell<br>L7  Bb<br>L8  Bb<br>L9  Cl Rapid Reload *<br>L10 Cl<br>L11 Bd<br>L12 Bd Curse Song<br>L13 Bd<br>L14 Bd <br>L15 Bd Lingering Song<br>L16 Cl<br>L17 Cl<br>L18 Bb Imp Crital X-Bow (last Barbarian level)<br>L19 Cl<br>L20 Bd <br><br>Pre epic ab 16/11/6/1 (four attacks per round)<br><br>L21 Cl Epic WF X-Box<br>L22 Cl<br>L23 Cl<br>L24 Bd Epic Skill Focus Dis<br>L25 Bd<br>L26 Bd<br>L27 Cl Epic Fort Save *<br>L28 Cl<br>L29 Cl<br>L30 Cl Hellball *<br>L31 Bd<br>L32 Bd<br>L33 Bd Greater Wis 1<br>L34 Cl<br>L35 Cl<br>L36 Cl Greater Wis 2<br>L37 Bd<br>L38 Cl<br>L39 Cl Armor Skin<br>L40 Bd  <br><br>Skill Points 190 (roughy)<br>Disipline 43<br>Tumble 40<br>SC 35<br>Consintration 43<br>Perform 25<br>A few left over for ???<br><br>Ab: With plan X-Bow<br>    37/32/27/22<br>    With +5 X-Bow and +12 to Wis and Song<br>    51/46/41/36<br>    With +12 to wis and +20 to ab all buffs<br>    63/58/53/48<br><br>Damage: Here is your weak point.  Not sure what it would be but your relying heavy on your buffs and some mighty to provide the damage.  I would have liked to try the Divine might and shield route but you dont have the feats for it (need 3 more).  You could take 6 levels of fighter and drop 2 level of cleric and the barb levels.  But then you lose Uncanny dodge and the +10% speed.  And the builds Idea is to out run your foes if needed and quickly reach those in the front lines that need healing / buffs or a moral boost with the song.<br><br>Buffs:<br>Cleric Spells (L9) and one Epic Spell<br>Bard Spells (L6) + Still Spell to cast in armor<br>Bard Song that lasts 11 rounds (16 use's)<br>Curse Song also to help drop ab and ac of oppoients <br><br>Imposion DC with +12 to wis would be 10+9+15= 34.  Not great but it should take care of Dex based archers that will be on the other side of the combat 'line'.<br><br>You could use Heavy armor but i think with 1.64 you will lose the barbarian speed.  Also you could drop the * feats and sub in others without ruining the build.<br><br>Feedback would be welcome!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Iron Ranger on 11/15/04 10:16</span></i></p>

Edit: Drop the Trickery domain and pick up Healing.  It is a support build and you will get Imp Inviso from L4 bard spells

Why not go with fighter levels instead of barbarian? Some simple level shifting can get you epic weapon focus. The loss is 8 hp max. The gain is 3 bonus feats.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

According to my manual, you need BAB +3 for Zen Archery, so if my calculations are correct, you'll have to wait to take it until you're level 6<br>_________________<br><i>"Destiny, chance, fate, fortune, they're all just ways of claiming your successes without admitting your defeats."</i><br>   --<i>Gerrard of the</i> Weatherlight

Edit:  Mistakes above.<br><br>1) First level will have to be Cleric and take the two spell feats (Still, Extended).  Take Barbarian 2nd Level and the next two feats will be Weapon Focus and Zen Archery (I forgot the +3 AB needed).  Bacicly remix the first 4 feats. <br>2) You cant get Hellball unless epic, so drop that feat and add in Epic Poweres (or any feat you like).  Drop SC skills then unless you feel you want the extra saveing throws (though you will be streached to reach 30 pts due to the change above)<br><br>Yes you could take Figher levels and get the Weapon Spec Feats for extra damage and drop 4 levels of Barb and 2 levels of Cleric and see no real change.  But I wanted someone with some extra speed for PvP were you could outrun others (slightly, at first I wanted monk but no go as it will not mix with bard) to your allies and heal or res them and move on.<br><br>I did this at work, and saw the mistakes when I came home.  Sorry about that, but the concept is still sound.  Wis based archer with huge number of support spells that has a good ab (when buffed) and can get around the battle field quickly.  This is not a solo Char and would strugle if you used it as such but it should level fine with such a mix of skills.

You also can get epic weapon spec with only 4 fighter levels. It is a personal choice though, and both I am sure work fine.
