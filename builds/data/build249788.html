Pretty strong combo, but any build with 20 wizard or sorcerer levels is pretty strong.  The cleric levels give you a ton of buffs for a good melee AB and monk levels give you that cheesy goodness.  Tough as nails against anything but a pure arcane caster, and even then you have spells to give you a shot there.  Nicely done.<br><br>Umm... don't you need to be an epic wizard to take an epic spell?

I played a similiar build once, and I think the only drawback I found was you don't feel the power of a build like this until the advanced epic levels.  I wouldn't play a build like this 1-40 as I've found that to be a grueling exercise, but once you get high level spells in both classes you are definitely a force to be reckoned with.  The addition of monk is very interesting.  Nicely done, and your TS + Harm tactic sounds pretty nasty!<br>_________________<br>Favorite PW's: Hall of the Worlds, Higher Ground, World of Iniquity.

I was sure you needed to be an epic caster to get epic spells. Perhaps it's similar to the 'epic' Bard and Lasting Inspiration and you only need 20 levels. This will bear investigation...<br><br>Cool build though Thax.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I played one of these (went 17/17/6 for even more cheese), and the biggest problem I had with it was that it took way longer to buff than it did to finish any given fight.  You seriously don't have enough quickslots to put all your buffs unless you leave out everything you consistently use in combat.  Still, in low-magic settings, there's nothing other meleers can do about a build like this.
