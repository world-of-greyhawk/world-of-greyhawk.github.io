Outcast from the place of his birth for his 'lower blood', and never accepted where he grew up for his outsider features, a Half-elf must learn to cope.  But never did either the realm of humans nor elves think that such a bastard could attain the great power of arcane words blended with martial prowess.  But attain he did, with power rivalling that of either parents.  He is more than a match for whatever comes his way.  He has nobody to love, but everything to prove.  The time of the bastard is soon upon us.  Then, all will be one.  The one shall be Retribution...<br><br>The air shall be filled with words and arrows, as the might of the bastard rains down destruction and a cleansing fire of justice and terribly beauty.  For it is written, in some of the ancient texts, that there will be a time of devastation upon the worlds of Elves and Humans.  This time, neither might recover.  The End, in a shower of death and purity, will come slowly to some, but to all it shall come.  When all is done, the price will have been paid.<br><br><br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br><br>Something I have been screwing around with.  Trying to find a good way to use Half-elf.  Also wanted an archer with more than a few buffing spells or using scrolls.  Not a melee fighter in the least.  Behind the lines, buffed up, sending in arrows and spells without saves over to the enemy.  A few good summons and tankish henchman are pretty much a must, unless you feel like having a lot of invisibility spells around.<br><br><br>Arcane Retribution<br>Half-elf<br><i>playable, 1-40, PvM</i><br>whatever alignment you wish<br><br><br>STR 10<br>DEX 16 to 30<br>CON 14<br>WIS 10<br>INT 16 to 19<br>CHA 8<br><br>all points into Dex<br><br><br>Full 9 levels of Wizard spells:<br>Offensive Favourites: Darkness, Melf's, Magic Missile, ILMS, IGMS, Bigby's, Grease, Vampiric Touch, etc.  Anything without a save is best.<br><br><br>Skills: 237 skillpoints<br>Discipline 40<br>Concentration 43 (45)<br>Spellcraft 41 (45)<br>Hide 36 (46)<br>Move Silently 37 (47)<br>Tumble 20[40 cc] (30)<br><br><br>Weapon: Longbow<br>Armor: Robes<br><br><br>AC: 24 naked<br>HP: 336<br><br><br>Attack: 50/45/40/35<br>Damage: 1d8 + 15 (19-20/x3)<br><br><br>Saving Throws: <br>        Fort: 25<br>        Will: 19<br>        Refl: 30<br><br><br>1 F1 Weap Foc:LB, Impr Intiative<br>2 W1      <br>3 F2 Point Blank Shot,Rapid Shot<br>4 W2<br>5 F3      <br>6 W3 Combat Casting<br>7 F4 Weap Spec: LB<br>8 W4 <br>9 AA1 Impr Crit:LB<br>10 AA2<br>11 AA3<br>12 W5 Extend Spell<br>13 AA4<br>14 AA5<br>15 AA6 Spell Penetration<br>16 AA7   <br>17 W6<br>18 AA8 Greater Spell Penetration<br>19 AA9<br>20 AA10  <br><br>21 W7 Epic Weap Foc:LB<br>22 W8<br>23 W9<br>24 W10 Great Int I,II <br>25 A11<br>26 W11<br>27 F5 Epic Prowess<br>28 W12     <br>29 W13<br>30 A12 Great Dex I<br>31 A13<br>32 A14      <br>33 W14 Great Dex II<br>34 A15<br>35 W15 Great Int III<br>36 A16 Great Dex III  <br>37 F6 Epic Weap Spec:LB<br>38 W16<br>39 A17 Great Dex IV<br>40 W17  <br><br><br>Comments and suggestions welcome.

Combat Casting helps most in the earlier levels when the -4 to concentration really hurts but in the long run, I'd prefer the 40 HPs but I guess that's really up to you. I'd also considered Blind Fight but you have spells and I'm not sure if it works for ranged combat against concealed opponents.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

Ya'll are both good builders, so take my comments for what it's worth.<br><br>If you are only taking four levels of fighter pre-epic, that's all I'd take.  Gives you two levels to do something else, like take AA to 19 (picking up a bonus feat to comp for the feat lost by not taking FTR 6 and an AB on your ranged attack) or Wiz to 19 (with the accompanying spells and DC).   <br><br>Or take the six fighter levels pre-epic (F6, AA10, Wiz 4) and pick up that AB earlier and with melee as well as ranged weapons.  <br><br>This may impact your ability to take EWS but meh on that anyway.

Fighter 6 = 2 levels for Disc dump post-epic and a free feat. chris can drop it to one if he likes but that mean Discipline and EWS waits till 39, which I'd rather not have - it hurts playability. Hope that clears up why those levels are there.<br><br>Also, he can only take a max of another 2 levels Wiz pre-epic and still maintain 4 apr. since you can only take a max of 10 levels of a prestige class pre-epic. He could do that actually and keep Fighter levels at 4 and still get EWS but that's another BAB point and squeezing more feats 'til epic.<br><br>The melee weapons thing thought might be an idea - dropping Combat Casting for finesse would do the trick.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.
