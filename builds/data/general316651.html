Hail, mighty ECBers. I was wondering if anyone could explain to me how dispelling works. I have tried to read the NWNWiki explanation, and honestly it doesn't match what you guys always talk about. I have always heard you say that being a lvl 26 caster makes you undispellable except with Mord's, because the dispeller needs to overcome the STATIC DC of 11 + caster lvl. However, NWNWiki says the following:<br><br>"When a dispel attempt is made, a dispel check is performed. The factors affecting this check are the caster level of dispeller and the effective level of the creator. The exact check is<br><br>1d20 + dispel's caster level  vs.  12 + creator's effective level.<br><br>with ties, as usual, going to the die roll (the effect is dispelled).<br><br>The in-game descriptions incorrectly report "11" instead of "12"."<br><br>So could anyone please clarify to me what this means? So if I am a lvl 40 Character with say 23 levels of Wizard, what is my EFFECTIVE LEVEL, as described in the NWNWiki explanation? Also, What is the Dispeller's Caster level? Does it vary according to the actual level of the dispeller or does each dispel effect have a pre-determined Caster level?<br><br>Does this mean that you'd be effectively undispellable at level 25 instead of 26??<br><br>So.....many........questions........ <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>Take it EZ!

Yah, 25 caster levels.  The 26 that's commonly quoted is a misconception.  It likely has something to do with those casters getting a bonus feat at 26, which makes it a great stopping point when aiming for dispellability, but, yes, all one needs is 25 caster levels to be undispellable, save from Mort's.
