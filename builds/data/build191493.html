Inspired by the famous 'Wheel of Time' books by Robert Jordan, this character is a true master of his blade, in or out of heavy armor. He is able to delve into his deep Ko'di (the Oneness) meditation, which strips him bare of emotion, yet heightens his senses.<br><br>- <b>Playable from level 1 - 40</b><br>Whether in PvP or PvM, you're deadly. You can make it without problem from level 1-40, and still be frightening at the highest level.<br><br><br><b>Advantages:</b><br>- High AB<br>With 22 weaponmaster levels, and huge strength, if you can’t hit it, pretty much no one can.<br><br>- High Damage<br>You have huge strength, both weapon specialisations (normal and epic). You’re using a Greatsword, which means you get 1.5 times strength damage. As far as melee characters go, your damage output is up there with the best of ‘em.<br><br>- Good HPs<br>You’re not a Dwarven Defender or Barbarian, but you’re not lacking in the HPs department either.<br><br>- Flexibility<br>If you can find the right gear (high DEX and WIS), you can remove your full plate completely, and walk around in monk clothing and still stand toe-to-toe with a knight in shining armor. For a strength based greatsword wielder, that’s exceptional. You’re a master of your weapon and your body, in armor or out of it.<br><br>- High detection<br>With maxed out Spot and Epic Skill Focus: Spot, only the most godly sneaks are going to pass you by.<br><br>- Highish Fortitude<br>You have Epic Fortitude, and while you’re no Paladin/CoT, with reasonable gear (Rings of Fortitude +5), you’ll be able to withstand nearly all potential Dev Crits, unless you roll 1.<br><br>- High Devastating Critical DC<br>You’re only 1 short of the highest DC for a reasonable balanced human weaponmaster (non RDD).<br><br><b>Disadvantages</b><br>- Mediumish AC<br>While you have among the best AC a strength-based two-handed weaponmaster can achieve, you don’t have a tower shield to carry about. That’s the option chosen, for the sake of dishing out horrendous amounts of damage.<br><br>- Knockdown<br>If you’re a fan of Knockdown and Improved Knockdown, you only get these important feats late in the levelling progression – level 37.<br><br>- Critical Reliant<br>You’re a true weaponmaster, and with all high level weaponmasters, if you’re facing a critical immune creature, life becomes difficult. That said, you have huge strength and the bonus strength damage from using a double-handed weapon to counteract that a fair bit.<br><br>- Poor Will save<br>Like most melee characters, you have a weakness on your will save. You have Still Mind, which gives you +2 against mind affecting spells, but you still need to watch those Will save spells.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 04/21/05 23:34</span></i></p>

<b>Guide to Tweaking</b><br><br>Basic Notes:<br>If altering this build, do *not* add monk before level 20 – you will lower your BAB. Make sure you have a final Monk level at level 37 to maximise tumble. Otherwise, change levelling order as you wish.<br><br>If you are able to get high DEX and WIS (Monk AC bonus), and something like +5 Monk Clothing, you may find you have a <i>higher AC than if you were wearing +5 Full Plate Armor!</i> Of course, you’d need to balance that with trying to maximise your STR, and to a slightly lesser extent, CON.<br><br><b>Alternatives:</b><br><br><i>+1AB and one extra feat</i><br>If you were desperate for one extra feat and +1AB to this build, make it a Fighter 12/WM 25/Monk 3. This reduces the concept of using a monk at all.<br><br><i>Improved Evasion and bonus Speed</i><br>If you wanted Improved Evasion, you could make it a Fighter 12/WM 19/Monk 9 - Monk Speed would be much more significant in this build.<br><br><i>Higher Skilled, Sneaky Dev Critter</i><br>Start with 14 Intelligence, and start out with 15 Strength. Instead of pouring points into Spot, save them for your monk levels. On your monk levels, max out hide and move silently. Take Epic Skill Focus: Hide, and Epic Skill Focus: Move Silently. Don’t take Epic Skill Focus: Spot. <br><br>You should end up with a character that can step out of the shadows, and devastating critical, with slightly less strength, and more vulnerable to sneaks.

Hello Avendesora!! I was looking for a build that uses Greatsword and I find this at the first page.<br><br>Its an amazing build!!!  And like a true Blademaster in Randland, he dont use a shield which make this build great to play on the WoT server.<br><br>Now I dont know if im gonna go with this build or a Fighter//Paladin//CoT, The later build gives you crazy saves. Like 60+, but it dont have any high AB, and no Dev.<br><br>Gaahh!! *CONFUSED*<br><br><br>// ps, you maybe dont remember me but anyway, good build.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Gekkou on 04/22/05 06:10</span></i></p>

Awesome build.  I have this up to level 16 on my high magic PW, and it is very good!  10-20 x3 crit rapier is what I am looking at right now with 34 AB.<br><br>My question is, how feasable would it be to change monk with rogue, assassin or shadowdancer?  If my UMD is high enough, I should be able to use Monk only robes for the AC benefit plus I went towards a Dex build with this.<br><br>Pretty much the changes I made were:<br><br>Str- 14<br>Dex- 16 (max)<br>Rapier<br><br>That is pretty much it.

There'd be no problem with that. This build could do reasonably well with pretty much any weapon.<br><br>In fact, it could be stronger (larger crit range, flexibility of using a shield or not when you have your Wisdom high or not), as long as you realise that:<br><br>a) A shield will lessen your stealth abilities (if you were going down that route), though you could simply equip it as soon as you came out of stealth.<br>b) A shield will remove any bonus from Monk Wisdom AC - and this is where your choice really lies. Do you get more AC from Wisdom, or from the Shield?<br>c) you'll lose the STR damage bonus on the greatsword. <br>d) The difference on the base damage on the weapon isn't so important. STR (and other feats) are where you're going to get most of the damage from in epic levels. It would be a little more noticeable at lower levels.<br><br>The only reason I really went with the Greatsword in this build was that this was a response to a request for a Greatsword wielding Monk/WM, and also the fact that warriors in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time setting tend not to use shields, preferring other styles instead.<br>_________________<br>If you must mount the gallows, give a jest to the crowd, a coin to the hangman, and make the drop with a smile on your lips.<br><i>-Birgitte</i><br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "5336", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Wheel of Time - The Third Age</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Avendesora84 on 09/26/05 14:47</span></i></p>

I have a build with a similar class split to this. Fighter 12/Monk 9/WM 19. It uses the two-bladed sword though. I would go for it if not using kamas.

I saw this and was intrigued. But I wanted a higher monk version of it. So I have a fighter 8/Monk 25/WM 7. If there's interest in it, I can post it. But it's quite similar in many ways. Still with the Greatsword. I have to say, this build concept is a lot of fun, well thought out, and effective while still being a great RP concept. One of my favorites on here I've seen.

You could take the other one at 27 or 32. If you dont mind losing 1 AB you could take one of the Monk levels pre-epic for an earlier skill dump and Monk speed and whatever other bonuses Monks get. Maybe 12, 22 or 27, and 37. Just depends on how early you want the bonuses and skill dumps.
