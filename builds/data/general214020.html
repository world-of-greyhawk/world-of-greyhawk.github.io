I was looking through the various dwarven defender builds and I was wondering why noone has yet to make a dex based dwarven defender that ends up with epic dodge and self-concealment V.  Maybe I missed it, but wouldn't that be an awesome combination?<br><br>Maybe I'm wrong, but these feats aren't class dependant so you could theoretically go Ftr10/Def30 and end up with 30/- DR, Epic Dodge, and 50% miss chance?<br><br>King Harbromm

You are wrong. There is a couple dex based defenders, don't know if they have all your feats though. There is no way to get epic dodge without either rogue or Shadowdancer levels, since you need Imp evasion and defensive rolls.<br><br>Self Concealment 10-50%<br>Type of Feat: (Epic) General<br>Prerequisite: DEX 30, , Hide 30, Tumble 30, 21st level, Improved<br>Evasion<br>Specifics: The character gains a 10% concealment bonus.

Yeah, before I posted this I hadn't read the exact prerequisites.  I just thought a high Dex and some tumble and you were good to go.  There's a lot more to it than I thought.<br><br>So, on a side note does everyone realize that with Self-Concealment V you get automatic sneak attacks every round as if you were in darkness?  I'm trying to make a roguish/assassin build that takes advantage of this but I'm NOT a dex builder.  Any help would be much appreciated.<br><br>My IDEAL character would have Epic Dodge, Blinding Speed, Self-Concealment V, Improved Whirlwind Attack, and lots of Death Attack/Sneak Attack damge.<br><br>King Harbromm

I've been puzzling with this, and can actually fit all your requests, tho I'm sure the build could perhaps be a better one without Improved WW. And do you truly need blinding speed?

That Self Concealment thing came from where I built a few of the builds on here in the toolset and had them fight each other with Tony's Henchmen AI update.  The Black Blade of Moradin was destroying people with sneak attacks every hit so I was thinking it was the Self Concealment.  In actuality, it's some sort of bug where enemies attacking a rogue(?) will walk up swing once and then turn their back on him, thus allowing a plethora of sneak attacks every round.<br><br>That build looks great.  I'm definitely going to try that out after I finish playing through with my modified Stonedeath.  Thanks a lot.<br><br>King Harbromm
