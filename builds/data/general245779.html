I think it would be good to add a list of tools people use to create epic builds somewhere on this forum. I personally use Kamiryn's CharacterBuildCalculator which can be found at: <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.detail&amp;id=856" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br><br>What other tools do people use for their builds?

What's wrong with doing it by yourself? it's better, like a little effort, and it will be most rewarding because you did the build by yourself. If you need assistance to make your own builds how will you assist another person when he asks for advice, giving him the tool? excuse me, but I think it's a bad idea.<br><br>Anyway, a tool as a testing stuff could get its uses, but I wouldn't trust it.

Good point, I suppose I should learn how to do it myself. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>I actually use a combination of the spreadsheet and the grimore and verify as I go. I should learn to do the calculations though, that would help me understand better.

Initially I started making the build right on the game, using DebugMode simple XP command, since I have no leveler Mods, and writing down what was coming up, but recently, I only use the game to test the builds, after using the grimoir I could start calculating saving throws, as they baffled me before, now I can write a build pretty fast.<br><br>Learning the feats is a must IMO, for example, before entering the guild I admit I had never seen Self-Concealment, as I never met the pre-requisites, so I couldn't make a build with it previously.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 07/04/06 04:35</span></i></p>

I build out of a concept or an rp-idea usually, or post an old build I have used somewhere. I scribble it down on paper in a mess of notes then test it, usually in the -Novice to Epic-. Then I also put it up and read more numbers from the CBC, like saves, bardsong, spell-slots etc. and use that for copy/pasting to save time. <br><br>Then when I post the build i sometimes forget to copy all my finished text and when I click post the site has auto-logged-off and everything is lost, like the build I tried to post yesterday. It will show itself in the future though, without making the same mistake for at least a little while.

I conceive a build and its general layout in my mind then I start Kamiryn's CBC and get all the details sorted out nicely, afterwards I level up and test the build in a test module at least. <br><br>Some of my builds do not get posted the moment they are ready and tested, I like to take them out for a ride before posting them on the guild's boards.

Right, the search engine, sometimes I use it and start making class combinations to find out what hasn't been done and has potential, most of the time ending with nothing or even 3 prestige classes <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>Hey, but if you make a story for your build, no tool will ever help you, and it ends much more cool and original IMO.
