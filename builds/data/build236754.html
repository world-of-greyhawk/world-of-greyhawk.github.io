This is a build made to smite both good and evil, being a Paladin/Blackguard, joined with Harper Scout at advice of FinneousPJ (however, using a Fighter might make it stronger).<br><br>The smiter isn't so much of a power build, since smiting can be easily avoided by PvPs, and uses more CHA tha it should in increasing the smite, so it works more in RP, it's cool for RP reasons to have a Paladin/Blackguard/Harper Scout.<br><br>Levels: 1-40<br>PvM, untested PvP<br><br>Human<br><br>Lawful Good -&gt; Lawful Evil<br><br>Stats: <br>STR 15 (16)<br>DEX 8<br>CON 12<br>WIS 14<br>INT 10<br>CHA 16 (28)<br><br>1 Paladin – Power Attack, Cleave<br>2 Paladin<br>3 Paladin – Extra Smiting<br>4 Paadin – CHA +1 (17)<br>5 Paladin<br>6 Paladin – Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>7 Paladin <br>8 Paladin – Cha +1 (18)<br>9 Paladin – Divine Might<br>10 Paladin<br>11 Paladin<br>12 Paladin – CHA +1 (19), Divine Shield<br>13 Paladin<br>14 Paladin<br>15 Paladin – Iron Will<br>16 Paladin – CHA +1 (20)<br>17 Paladin<br>18 Paladin – Alertness<br>19 Paladin<br>20 Paladin – CHA +1 (21)<br>21 Harper Scout – Great Charisma I (22), Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>22 Harper Scout<br>23 Harper Scout<br>24 Harper Scout – CHA +1 (23), Great Charisma II (24)<br>25 Harper Scout – Great Charisma III (25)<br><br>26 Blackguard<br>27 Blackguard – Great Smiting I<br>28 Blackguard – STR +1 (16)<br>29 Blackguard<br>30 Blackguard – Great Smiting II<br>31 Blackguard<br>32 Blackguard – CHA +1 (26)<br>33 Blackguard – Great Smiting III<br>34 Blackguard<br>35 Blackguard<br>36 Blackguard – CHA +1 (27), Great Smiting IV<br>37 Blackguard<br>38 Blackguard – Great Smiting V<br>39 Blackguard – Great Smiting VI<br>40 Blackguard – CHA +1 (28)<br><br>Skills:<br>Discipline 43<br>Tumble 20<br>Hide 5<br>Search 4<br>Lore 6<br>Persuade 8<br>24 remaining points (10 spellcraft might be useful)<br><br>HP: 420<br>AC: 13 (9 base, 4 tumble)<br>Buffed AC: 30 (9 base +2 Harper’s Cat’s Grace (DEX 12+), +4 tumble, +15 Divine Shield with Maxed CHA)<br>Buffed AC with Full Plate and Tower Shield: 41<br><br>BAB: 30<br>AB: +33<br>AB with focused weapon: +36<br>Sneak Attack 4d6<br>Divine Might: 9 - 15 divine damage, depending on buffs<br><br>Svaving Throws:<br>Fortitude: 42<br>Reflex: 33<br>Will: 38<br><br>Smites both good and evil, 3 times per day each.<br><br>Smite Good: +9 AB, +90 damage<br>Smite Evil: +9 AB, +120 damage<br>Buffed changes to +15 AB<br><br>-All paladin spells, divine favor maxed power.<br>-Harper spells and potion crafting.<br>-Blackguard Bull’s Strength<br><br>He has no trouble in buffing his CHA to max using Paladin and Harper Spells, for a +15 on smiting, divine might, divine shield, and extra +12 on saves.<br>He can buff his STR quite easily with Blackguard’s Bull’s Strength adding to Paladin Bull’s Strength.<br>He can buff his DEX to maximize AC using a Full Plate<br><br>Advantages: Good saves, decent AC.<br><br>Disadvantages: Low HP, low AB.<br><br><br>Well, for this build I made a story, my first time making story for a build, hope you like it (Note: I'm terrible at names of people, the build guy is Vremont).<br><br>-A strange man enters the Great Temple of Helm-<br><br>Sir Thomas: "Welcome traveler, what is it you seek in the Temple of Helm?"<br>-"My name is Vremont, paladin of the holy order of Lathander.", said the traveler.<br>Sir Thomas: "Greetings, what brings a paladin of Lathander here?"<br>Vremont: "I came here by Lathander command; it is a time of need in this town isn't it?"<br>Sir Thomas: "You startle me, the town is in perfect conditions, but if Lathander brought you here your help will most surely be required, stay here as long<br>as you wish."<br>Vremont: "Thank you, however, since it's all in good conditions, I will depart tomorrow, I'm sure the paladins here should be able to take care of whatever could happen."<br><br>-Vremont left the Temple-<br><br>"Who was he"? asked Burnam.<br>Sir Thomas: "He said he is a Paladin of the holy order of Lathander that came to aid us in time of need."<br>Burnam: "Strange, I've never heard before of Paladins of Lathander."<br><br>Vremont scouted the city for several hours, there is a Harper Compound at the other side of town, and in the very center of town, a small church.<br><br>"What is that?" asked Vremont to a townfolk<br>-"It's the sanctuary of Helm, beneath it lies the blessed armor of Helm, which legend sais he used when he descended to Earth to vanquish the Lagoonate, an evil monster that killed thousands on ancient times."<br>Vremont: "Hmmm, but, how could an armor so important be left unguarded in the middle of the city?"<br>-"There's no problem, it is safe caged by a magical force field, only the paladins at the Great Temple of Helm could know how to open it."<br>Vremont: "Thank you sir."<br><br>Vremont left for the Temple<br><br>Sir Thomas: "So, how was town?"<br>Vremont: "Interesting, I visited the sanctuary of Helm, and I can't believe Helm's Blessed Armor is left unguarded."<br>Sir Thomas: "There is no problem, the armor is shielded by a magical barrier, wich can only be broken using the sword of Lagoonate, however, the sword is broken, separated in two, we keep one part, the blade it's at the basement, and there's always someone guarding there, for example, Burnam will stay all night there, if someone suspicious goes near, all the paladins will be there in ten seconds, and the Harpers keep the other part, the hilt, at the other side of the town keep the other, so there's no way someone could hold the complete sword and forge it back into one." <br>Vremont: "Hmmm, now I see."<br>Sir Thomas: "It's getting late now, let me show you your room."<br>Vremont: "Ok."<br> <br>Thomas gives Vremont the key to his room, on the second floor of the Temple.<br>The next morning......<br> <br>Hijack: "Ok, Burnam its time for my shift.... what the? Burnam!"<br> <br>Burnam is dead, and the chamber to the sword of Lagoonate is broken, the blade has been stolen.<br> <br>Hijack: "Gragner! go to Sir Thomas, the sword of Lagoonate has been stolen!"<br>Gragner: "Yes, sir."<br> <br>-"What? stolen? it can't be..... how did.... who killed Burnam and stole the sword without making a single noise?" asked Sir Thomas<br>Vremont: "Look here...... there is a bottle on the floor."<br>Sir Thomas: "What do you think it is? can it point the thief?"<br>Vremont: "Well, not quite so, however, this potion is special, I've seen some of these before, it can only be crafted by a skilled Harper..."<br>Gragner: "Those harpers! they have the other part and are planning to take over Helm's Blessed Armor"<br>Sir Thomas: "But the Harpers are good people, that's why we left the other part of the sword to them."<br>Vremont: "Probably that's why he could get so close to Burnam without any suspect..."<br>Hijack: "I won't wait another moment, let's go to these Harpers, Paladins to me at once!"<br> <br>A group of paladins ran at the call, and went to the Harper Settlement.<br> <br>Sir Thomas: "I can't believe it.... however, what can we do now?"<br>Vremont: "Hijack is leaving for the Harper Compound, however, if Helm's Sactuary hasn't been defiled yet, we may still be in time to get there and guard it."<br>Hijack: "Good idea, Sir Thomas, go with Vremont and defend the place at all costs."<br><br>The two parties left.<br> <br>When Sir Thomas entered the Sanctuary he felt relieved that the armor was still there, and the barrier was still up...... without notice, a great slash went through him, cutting his right arm off.<br> <br>Vremont: "Well, well, nicely done paladins... heh"<br>Sir Thomas: "Traitor!"<br>Vremont: "Hold your speech old man, or you'll die sooner, I'll give you the pleasure of witnessing how I take the Blessed Armor of Helm."<br><br>Meanwhile, Hijack arrived at the Harper Compound, where the Harpers where discussing loudly just outside.<br><br>Hijack: "Traitors, give back the sword of Lagoonate!"<br>Harper Leader: "What? we give it back? better you give back ours, or explain how the hilt of the sword was stolen by a paladin."<br>Hijack: "You dare to say a paladin stole it!?"<br>Wounded Harper: "I saw it with my own eyes, however, I was unable to stop him."<br>Hijack: "Then how do you suspect this Harper vial got to our temple at the crime scene?"<br>Harper Leader: "You are framing us? enough! consider our friendship ended."<br>Hijack: "Better consider yourselves ended, paladins attack!"<br> <br>Th paladins, who outnumbered the Harpers by much started killing them like savage beasts.<br><br>Meanwhile, at the sanctuary, Vremont takes out the blade and hilt of the sword of Lagoonate.<br> <br>Sit Thomas: "The sword is broken, no amount of forgery will bend it together, your scheme will end pitifuly."<br>Vremont: "You're such a fool Thomas, the sword still has all its energy."<br><br>The blade and the hilt, being brought close to each other, started to glow and levitate, then Vremont takes out his own sword and places it between the broken parts of the sword of lagoonate.<br> <br>Vremont: "It is not forgery how you reincarnate a magical weapon, you just need to cast its magical power into a new vessel...."<br>Sir Thomas: "It can't be!"<br><br>Vremont casts a strange spell, the sword of lagoonate started to glow with more intensity, soon after, both parts launched a magical ray at Vremont's sword, infusing it with its power, after that, the broken sword of Lagoonate fell to the ground. <br> <br>Vremon: "It is done......"<br>Sir Thomas: "But how? how did you managed to do this? why does a paladin betrays his order!?"<br>Vremont: "Fool, Lathander's order doesn't exists anymore, they made me a paladin, but I killed them all in return, I'm also a master in Harper skills, I made the Harper potion to frame them and used my paladin skills to frame you in their eyes, but my true nature is evil, and now I'll get all the power in the world."<br> <br>With a single slash, the barrier dissolves, shooting out energy and making an earthquake.<br> <br>Hijack: "Well, all the Harpers are dead now, however, none of them had the hilt nor the blade of the sword.... let's go with Sir Thomas to the sanctuary of...."<br> <br>The earth shakes with a large noise.....<br> <br>Hijack: "What!? the barrier.... has it borken? paladins, to the sanctuary!"<br> <br>Vremont wears Helm's armor, full plate, boots, gloves, helmet, and a shield, after he has the whole armor on, it starts to change of color.<br> <br>Sir Thomas: "The white Blessed Armor of Helm... what is happening to it?"<br>Vremont: "Hah, forget the Blessed Armor, now it's the Tainted Armor of Helm" -changes to a deep black- "and all its power is mine, now allow me to demonstrate."<br>Hijack: "Stop rigtht there you fiend."<br>Vremont: "Oh, more meat to test my new strength."<br>Sir Thomas: "You'll never defeat 16 paladins at once."<br>Vremont: "Hmm, is that true?"<br> <br>-The paladins rush against Vremont-<br> <br>Vremont: "Take this: Tainted Explosion!"<br> <br>A great dark ball, working like a self-Hellbal, destroys everything surroinding Vremont: all the paladins and the the sanctuary.<br> <br>Vremont: "I think I'll like this armor."<br><br><i>Fixed typos - Kail Pendragon</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 04/15/06 17:00</span></i></p>

I'll read the story and give you feedback on that too, but I'm too tired now.<br><br>About the build, first you forgot to spend 6 points on your abilities. Is your WIS supposed to be 14 maybe?<br><br>Second, I'd go for Pal 19/BG 16 for an extra feat (epic prowess or armor skin maybe?). <br><br>Third, Fighter instead of HS is something to consider. I'd go Paladin 19/Fighter 5/BG 16, EWS will help your dmg output.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

I wrote 8 WIS!!! that's not right, it should be 14....<br><br>Hmmm, sure, I'll try with Paladin 19 Blackguard 16, I knew I was making some mistake around because I made all Paladin then all Harper Scout and then all Blackguard to avoid Alignment changes as much as possible... however, an extra epic feat should go on more Great Smiting, I didn't take Armor Skin or Epic Prowess on purpose... being able to smite both good and evil strongly with balanced power is the idea of the build, I know perfectly it sacrifices a lot of real power (specially AB, which is quite a problem), in a powerbuild I probably wouldn't take any Great Smiting.<br><br>I considered Fighter as it gives +6 damage, bonus feats, and would simplify alignment change, say, for the Paladin 19 / Blackguard 16, whih needs to be Lawful Good for paladin, evil at level 19, then non-evil at 20 for Harper Scout and evil again at 25 to continue Blackguard, it's not so hard though, but Fighter instead of Harper Scout just become evil when Paladin is enough and use fighter levels between to arrange stuff. At any rate, I never used before a Harper Scout, FinneousPJ told me to use a HS when I asked for advice on the third class (although I'm beggining to think he just said Harper Scout as an immediate reaction), it works decently, buffs are quite good and allows me to take Great Smiting earlier with the bonus Great CHAs.

You should probably make room for blind-fight also. Very important feat against people with improved invisibility or displacement which can make a huge difference for any build that plans to melee.

The problem is that I don't have any spare feats unless I take off Great Smiting, pre-epic feats are all needed....<br><br>Harper Scout has Tumble as class skill?! damn..... in that case........ Tumble would be 25 releasing 15 skillpoints (yay, +1 AC).

Pfft, you have made this personal with all those "FinneousPJ made me do it!" statements, so here's the deal:<br><br>Fighter, and what it gives ye.<br><br><ul><br><li>two feats, EWF and another feat<br></li><li>EWS, which equals +6 damage compared to a build without it<br></li></ul><br><br>Not that much, now is it? Harper Scout next.<br><br><ul><br><li>two feats, two Great Charismas<br></li><li>special abilities, namely<br><ul><br><li>Bardic Knowledge (+5 Lore)<br></li><li>Deiner's Eye<br></li><li>Sleep<br></li><li>Cat's Grace<br></li><li>Tymora's Smile<br></li><li>Eagle's Splendour<br></li><li>Lliira's Heart<br></li><li>Craft Harper Item<br></li><li>Invisibility<br></li></ul><br></li><li>Tumble<br></li></ul><br><br>The downside is having to pick Alertness which isn't that special, Iron Will never hurts.<br><br>In conclusion, I stronly believe the Harper's abilities benefit this build a lot more than the Fighter's simple +6 damage. We can see how Cat's Grace compliments the 8 DEX nicely, to get the best possible AC in Full Plate, and how Eagle's Splendour adds to our saves (Divine Grace and Dark Blessing), damage (through Divine Might), AC (through Divine Shield) and AB (through Smite Evil and Smite Good). HS can also give us up to +4 more AC through Tumble compared to the Fighter. The Harper's other abilities aren't too great for this build, but they don't hinder it either. All in all, I prefer the Harper Scout.

Glad you liked it, though I wasn't aware you made Paladin/HS/Blackguards, back then I simply checked the build searcher and there was no build that made good use of both smites so I tried myself, it was a sort of RP build but it ended stronger than I expected (I thought it would be a fun idea but a crappy build, and it's actually decent enough), Paladin and Blackguard make good synergy even if they are supposed to be like opposite classes.
