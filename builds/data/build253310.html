<b>Race:</b> Human<br><b>Alignment:</b> Starting any Lawful, shift to any Non-Lawful at level 7<br>Playable PvM 1 - 40<br><br>This class combination has not been done before, probably because of the alignment shift.

In a lot of ways, Strength Monks and RDD were made for each other (loads of “free” AC to get semi-close to Dex monks, and a bunch of other goodies), it's just too bad the only way to qualify is through classes with Charisma as a core ability, adding to the monk's already tough spread.<br><br>As it is, the build isn't particularly feat starved, and its easy enough to get to Dex 15 to qualify for Ambidexterity, but I generally don't feel the feat investment is worth it unless you have Sneak Attacks, Flame Weapon, or Darkfire at your disposal.  All in all, “wasted” item slots aside, single wielding a kama isn't that bad, imo, because you still get 5 or 6 attacks per round (as much as a “normal” dual wielder), and you get to keep the benefits of Deflect Arrows.<br><br>This build could definitely use Improved Evasion to shore up the weak save, and taking 3 more monk levels to get it is certainly possible, but at the cost of 1 AB and an Epic Feat (which translates to an additional -2 AC, -1 AB/ damage, or no Lasting Inspiration).  Going to Monk 10 for the +1 AC may seem a good idea, but it forces you to delay RDD 10 to level 40, so you can take Bard 20 at level 39.<br><br>Otherwise, Str, Con, Dex, and Wis can all be adjusted to taste (or even Int if you don't mind losing skill points), but I wouldn't recommend raising any of them above 14 at creation.<br><br>Comments/ criticisms/ suggestions welcome <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>(I enjoy writing parenthetically (a lot)).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 05/27/10 21:09</span></i></p>

I would consider going Monk 8/ Bard 4/ RDD 8 pre-epic to get +1 AB. <br><br>I would suggest dropping DEX to 12 and WIS to 10, which would allow you to boost your CON to 14 giving you a +2 to your Fort Save and 80 HP, which currently you would benefit from.<br><br>Currently you do not get anywhere close to the Perform requirements for a 24th Bard or Curse Song. At best you can get a 19th Bard Song and 20th Curse Song (which assumes you have sung your Bard Song beforehand).<br><br>You could go Monk 10/ RDD 10/ Bard 20 quite easily to get that Improved Evasion Feat, increase movement speed by 10%, Unarmed Attack improvement also. Doing this you can maintain the same AB at 41, and drop STR by 2 points to include Epic Skill Focus: Taunt, if required.<br><br>I would consider dropping Expertise for Extend Spell, particularly to make the build more effective throughout its life.<br><br>Thoughts and ideas reallu.

More HP are certainly always welcome, but so is AC, and I would rather get hit 10% less often than soak 80 more points of damage.  If neither Dex nor Wis were also tied to saves, adding to Con would be a no brainer, but as it is, I think its somewhat debatable, but perhaps I'm overlooking something.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Currently you do not get anywhere close to the Perform requirements for a 24th Bard or Curse Song.

So, once you hit level 6 Monk you have to make sure you start making more "Chaotic" choices that way your character will be of Neutral or Chaotic alignment by the time you hit level 7 thus opening up the ability to select the Bard class.

You shift alignment by doing unlawful events during the game.  The difficult thing with alignment switches is that they arent always allowed on pws due to balancing issues.
