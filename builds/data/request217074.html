Gotta have 5 levels of druid to be a shifter. Also, you can only have 3 classes. Your build is impossible. Sorry, but them's the breaks.

It would get adjusted with CHar bonuses... I never worry about the skills that are affected by "ex-post-facto". But Tumble isn't like all the other skills... It's not really ALL that important to wait 2 (long... very long in most worlds) levels. Just my opinion... but I've never been to a world without a Nymph Cloak or it's equal in it. So... I'll stick to my build (that I haven't yet built, LOL.)

Thing is though, you probably DO want to take the last bard level at 38th to get UMD to 41 because with all the other cloaks on offer, why would you want to use a nymph cloak? There's probably something better to occupy your cloak slot.<br><br>Also, 16 INT is rather expensive (some shapes don't shift your STR/CON/DEX so I'd leave those at least at 10 and I don't think the normal Bioware character creator process allows you to take bard at level 1 (boohoo, lose 8 skillpoints but there's also a bug that takes the casterlevel of the first class used so another reason to take druid 1st).<br><br>Also, he's a shifter first and foremost. I don't think any shifted shapes use a longbow (so why bother taking the focii? You won't be fighting in human form) and taking the other shapes, especially undead, so late really hurts the playability. 6 bard levels - I question the use of curse song when you can only sing 6 times per day. And where's empower spell or maximise spell to take advantage of unlimited rhakshasa icestorms? With such high WIS (and subsequently, a high will-save) strong soul is nearly a wasted feat. Better off taking KD/IDK and Expertise/Imp. Expertise. Shifters don't get many feats extra so choose them wisely.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

The only shifted form with missile weapons is the Manticore, and Zen Archery does not help for that.<br><br>I'd use all those feets for something other than being a Bow person.  Improved Initiative, toughness, some saving throw bonuses, disarm, KD, you name it.

Shifters are really feat starved. I'd prolly take Extend Spell, Empower Spell, start with Druid and get KD/IKD, maybe Expertise/Imp Expertise and start with 14 INT and get STR/DEX/CON higher, especially CON. Some good shapes don't shift those stats eg. Risen Lord form uses your human form's base DEX and that's a good form with already lowish AC but goot physical defenses with the 50% slashing and 50% piercing immunities.<br><br>Toughness is nice but since Druid/Shifters get so few feats to spend (the better, Epic shapes nead feats to be used on them and Dragon Shape really needs Great WIS to be burned on it and early), I'd prolly not get it.<br><br>Heavy Armor prof. and Exotic Weapon prof would be really nice too as only the stats of your weapons shift but again, you can't really afford it.<br><br>If what Grimnir77 says is true and unarmed focii now work for unarmed shapes, you'll prolly want to get them (and subsequently, you won't have much room left in the build for much else).<br><br>Blind Fight will help you fight concealed opponents - True Seeing no longer helps with that, but you might not be able to get it (depends on your environment. Personally I have a special loathing for missing spectres and the like 50% of the time while they drain your STR until you can't move).<br><br>PS: one annoying thing I hate about trying to play a shifter is doorways. A lot of the shapes, like Drider, (let alone dragon) can't fit through default NWN doorways. Then, some PWs won't let you get infinite uses of those shapes (wow, rest every 10 secs to get through a door and still be able to fight?). Go figure.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

Just start as a Druid then - Druid at level 1, bard at level 2, then it should be legal. You'd probably do it anyway because of the casterlevel bug with shifter. I was mistaken in my belief that bards got 6 skillpoints per level (bah).<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

I had a similar idea eralier and it had plenty of RP capabilities. Sure it seems powergamed but It is completely justifiable by my RP for it. I called the build the Disciple of the Stone fist. THe concept was an order of extremely devout druids (of course, druid and monk come to play here) who focus on making themselves as perfect as mother nature herself. They become so excellently calm of body and mind that they learn to eventually take on the form of an Eldar Earth elemental and go forth to smash the enemies of nature... Quite conveniently he has enough monk levels for improved evasion(9). Cooincidence? *coughing*<br><br>I decided to rely on buffing up in druid form then shifting into Eldar earth elemental form. He decided to ignore the monk class's bonus to unarmed damage and skip straight up to 2d10 fists at level 16 druid (YAY elemental form <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> ). HE took focuses in Unarmed combat and was very effective in the Halls of Advanced trtaining. His toughest enemy was the Demilich (who had a field day bragging about his lvl 30ish caster lvl and dispelled me in three tries: once was absorbed by spell resistance, twice to remove spell resistance (kinda poor rolls on that dispel check) and thrice to remove everything else). This failure aside he was incredibly effective (having stacked every Phys dmg sheild from stoneskin to premonition, +energy buffer and Lvl 2 Buffs, also had Camoflauge and the like and aura of Vitality.) He was pure wisdom and had an excellent AC after he shifter (about 47 ish) and managed to have one of the best damage rolls I've ever seen on a Alternate form. He attacked 7 times per turn with flurry on and dealt 2-20 +14 (OOOOUCH) and this was actually after aura of vitality, whioc meant the loss of AB was negated and i Dealt 2-20 +16... He also had the dirty habit of hitting for 60-70 on criticals... I dont recall whether or not i had Improved critical Unarmed, but i did have prowess and Focuses. <br><br>He was a powergamed build, yet he was effective.<br><br>I coulda nerfed him REAL bad and added cleric... but that makes even Me twitch (LOL inside joke, as in inside the shifter sticky). <br><br>Need I mention he also had his Bear and Elemental swarm to help tank damage from IGMS. I would also like to add that Elemental swarm does an exellent job at maintiang misile absorption (First IGMS is deivided by 3, meaning 6 missiles for 4d6 (24d6) on all and 1 missile on the closest (26d6). My 24HD elemental absorbs this one guarenteed. My companion usually survives via Aura of Vitality. After the second blast, the same is dealt and my elemental may be dead (unless earth type, in which case it has barely any life left), and my companion is for sure. <br><br>The following blasts then target 40d6 worth of dmg at us (4d6 over 10 missiles). My elemental is now dead. If he RS'd he is either near death or injured varying by type. After the next blast, My HP is critical and i pre-cast Mass heal to save me. My HP is restored to about full and i am reduced to near death by this blast. My elemental has respawned. I cast another Mass heal and hope they run out soon enough (5 blasts so far). Six blasts is the cap, and they launch the sixth. I think i may be alive by about 14 or so HP at that point. Mass heal 2x and i can finally kill him without worries. I tend to use my IKD from monk to knock em off their high horse and stomp em a nice new moodhole. I put out so much damage that their damage sheilds quickly succumb (even 100 dmg/lvl at lvl 38 may not be enough to stop my onslought.. it is a scary sight).<br><br>This is a new take on the Druid / Shifter and it Axes the shifter. I may try this on antiwolrd to see how it fares.
