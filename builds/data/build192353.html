There is a slight problem in your build order.  One of the prereqs for Epic Dodge is 30 ranks in tumble.  That's doesn't count your DEX bonus; it means 30 skill points invested in tumble.  It's impossible to get Epic Dodge before level 27.  But, you can easily switch your feats around to fix that.<br><br>Steve

Really?  Sheesh.  Even the grimoire didn't catch that.  I wonder why such an obvious bug hasn't been fixed yet.<br><br>Anyway, while building this up to test it (it did of course allow Epic Dodge at 21 as Syrath says due to that bug), I came across one other minor issue.  For whatever reason, even though Ambidexterity and Two-Weapon Fighting are on the Fighter Bonus Feat list, they are <b>not</b> on the CoT bonus feat list.  Unsure if this is a bug or due to the fact that the CoT seems like a sword and board type class, but it's true.  That means you can't take Ambidexterity and Two-Weapon Fighting at level 12.  You can take Ambidexterity and Knockdown at level 12, Improved Knockdown at level 14, Two-Weapon Fighting at level 15, and Improved Two Weapon Fighting at level 18.<br><br>Steve

It gives you an extra attack (at -22 AB when dual wielding. It gives +2 to all saves, handy but hardly essential. Fighter would be good, but you get an XP penalty ( but you do get specialisation for an epic +6 damage against sneak immune), it also gives another feat. 2nd criticism would be that you take improved sneak attack , you could take great dex at level 21 (for the greater good) and take epic dodge on your bonus feat level. This would set you up for earlier concealment. Concealment IMO is better than dodge when used alone, since it is useful against spells and melee and against ALL attackers.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

Thanks for the comments.  When I tested the build I entered the feats in a slightly different order so I did not catch the issue with the CoT feat list, the correction proposed makes sense.<br><br>I am using CoT instead of fighter because of the xp penalty.  If that is not an issues, fighter makes a  stronger build for sure.  However, in the analysis of the benefits of using CoT as opposed to rogue only, you get a +1 advantage of BAB on all attacks also which is important.  This type of build is either hit-and-run or a flanker.  For the hit and run, you want to make sure you hit as often as you can, that's why I tried to optimize AB.<br><br>And yes, the build can be changed to bring the first concealment from level 33 to 29, but that's at the cost of delaying epic dodge from 21 to 24 and loosing one of the improved sneak or the epic weapon focus.  I think it's an equally good choice and it depends on the server you play on.  In my case, with slow leveling, delaying from 21 to 24 means weeks if not months and I rarely make it post-30 with a character anyhow, but for faster leveling servers, it sounds like a good alternative.<br><br>Actually, if you don't mind waiting a little for epic dodge and the SC I-V, using human and fighter is probably the best build once at level 40.  (That build must have been posted before but I am not certain as I searched the list with CoT).  We are a little far away from the starting goal of the build though! <br><br>Thanks for the comments so far!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Drallimer on 04/26/05 18:52</span></i></p>
