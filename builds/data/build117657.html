At level 40 she has a lvl 11 bardsong. This can boost the saves a little, gives 2 deflection AC and some temporary hitpoints. The character will have access to level 2 bard spells. Spells such as Protection from Alignment, Mage armor, Ghostly visage, bull's strength etc. can be cast to buff up. This character can also cast arcane spells from scrolls. She can kill most anything at good range. Those who are foolish enough to engage her in melee will end up at the sharp end of her 15-20/x4 spear. I recommend leather armor or perhaps robes for this character, to put that DEX bonus to good use.<br>_________________<br>Me go gem!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 16:46</span></i></p>
