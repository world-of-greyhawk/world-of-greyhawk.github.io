Note: re: Divine Wrath - should point out that, while it's a great boost, only lasts the duration of the Cha-bonus (in this case, that's a whopping 3 rounds <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  <br><br>While it may be sufficient to go the first couple rounds with re: epic mages, who'll toss everything at you that they can, as you run over with Barbarian speed and do an IKD, good to boost the cha and thus the duration, yes?<br><br>Just thought I'd point that out and, as always, look forward to all your great observations, advice and comments!<br><br>PS. only one other build with pally/barbarian on the pulse cap search, just one, a different build, using pally/barbarian/ftr, and its by our very own illustrious leader, Anuis! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">

Thanks, Sir Moderator! Look forward to your review, one wild-pally to another <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">    Took a gander at yours, it's a cool charisma-based Pally-Gone-Wild. Definitely need to get him up on that engine(and with a story for sure)! <br><br>This build, the Wolf Knight, is STR/melee, a different build, but kinda similar in terms of the story: I envision this character as setting out, a loyal knight out to do the King's bidding (being William I, the Conqueror (1066-1087), Monarch of Britain-plus). Coming across the early Britons, fighting on-the-fly, and learning their methods. Perhaps, on the other hand, his loyalty changed: after succeeding, and being well-rewarded in terms of land and titles, he settled down and married a local Brit. Charmed and entrhalled by the richness of the land and culture, maybe he began to sympathise with his neighbors, and thus the questions <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>Hey, maybe we should collaborate on those "wild pally" stories! Surprisingly, there just aren't that many wild-pally's out there; Oh, the discrimination, losing one's right to progress in pally levels (barring another alignment change) simply for coming-of-age, for being wild; perhaps a support group for wild-pally's is in order?! ... <br><br>Thanks, Kail. I'm glad you like him (yours is cool,  too) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  <br><br>"I Have A Dream . . .

Alright: Here is is - The Wolf Knight, who now comes with some more of those great CoT accessories (kinda like getting a present, a remote-control car or something, and pleasantly finding that batteries ARE included. LOL<br><br>As you can see, bumped up CHA; lost +1 AB ie STR but gets that back with the Bless Spell (which goes the duration of level, not limited by cha, and thus a very useful and good one <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">     Also, more skills - taunt and intimidate are fully trained, with extra pumped into concentration + some more heal (can put it all into heal if you like). As to Cha, CoT's divine wrath boosts now last 4 whole turns (yep, gotta love those accessories! (ah, but cha 18, - that extra COT round is good, now bring on those eagle's potions for even more; much much more practical and handy, too (yeah, ok, I admit it: I like accessories, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>18 CHA also makes a diff. in terms of healing/pos. energy dam., esp. now that we added another CoT level in exchange for Bbn, without giving up any of the Bbn's raging abilities, speed, etc. - Oh, and those SAVES (nice call, Mith!) - plus, toughness, yep, took it; nice call there, too.
