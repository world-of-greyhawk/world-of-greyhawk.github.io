MONK<br>A monks speed, power, grace and force of will are unmatched by mortal beings. Powers continuously multiply as they shed their mortal shell and accepts an inner tranquility that lesser characters cannot even dream of...<br><br>CHAMPION OF TORM<br>Champions of Torm are mighty warriors who dedicate themselves to Torm's cause, defending holy ground, destroying enemies of the church and slaying mythical beasts. Torm guides the champion on their journey. A champion has ascended through the ranks of holy warriors to become a symbol of Torm's might...<br><br>WEAPON MASTER<br>For a weapon master, perfection is found in the mastery of a single melee weapon. A weapon master seeks to unite this weapon of choice with the body, to make them one and to use the weapon as naturally and without thought as any other limb. The weapon master's bond with his weapon of choice becomes stronger and devastatingly effective as he and the weapon become singular...<br><br>Hikaru Ryuu also known as: Shining Dragon of Torm, Torm's Grandmaster Sword, Symbol of Torm<br><br>(Rough Draft)<br>Snippet:<br>Training in the shaolin temple for two years under the tutelage of Grandmaster Yuudai, Hikaru Ryuu forced himself through the rigorous physical and mental training Grandmaster Yuudai had in store. <br>However, Hikaru's training had come to an abrupt stop when a battered beggar came to the doors of the temple begging for help. Grandmaster Yuudai, a generous man, took the beggar in and tended to the wounds as quickly as possible. As Grandmaster Yuudai began to stand up, the beggar struck out at Grandmaster Yuudai with his right hand. The grandmaster caught the beggars clumsy and feeble attack but after a few moments he looked wide-eyed at the beggar who had a grin from ear to ear. Hikaru, stared at the beggars left hand and the knife that had pierced his master heart, and before he knew what happened, he snapped into motion, moving like lightning, Hikaru struck his left leg around and landed a heavy blow to the beggars head. The beggar, taken by surprise, flew clear across the room, thudded against the wall and lay slumped down. <br>Hikaru was quickly by his masters side and trying to tend the wound that was inflicted. The grandmasters eyes were already blurry and the blood around the wound was a strange greenish color. <br>Poison! Hikaru began to panic, his master had shown him how to meditate and slowly remove poisons from his body, but it didn't look like the grandmaster was doing that, his breathing had slowed down dramatically and his body began to shudder. Hikaru didn't know what to do, his master was dying and he couldn't do anything to help him. The grandmaster looked at Hikaru and whispered,<br>"Seek...the sw-sword, under...the...s-s-st-ahhh." The grandmaster wheezed and lay still. Hikaru, cheeks streaked with tears, set his master down, stood up and looked over to the beggar who looked like he was coming back to consciousness.<br>"Hu-?" Hikaru struck, palm outward and fingers tucked, against the beggars face and a grotesque snap was heard throughout the temple. Hikaru searched the beggar for clues as to who sent this assassin. The assassin wore a gauntlet with a black fist squeezing rays of green emblazoned on it. Hikaru took a mental picture of that symbol and vowed to avenge his master, first he had to find the sword but where was it...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 03/21/09 16:12</span></i></p>

I do not agree to CoT comments over fighter. Saves will be better agreed. How come his feats are better? You take nothing a fighter couldn't take.

Actually fighter would give you two feats over CoT.  Fighter gets the martial weapon proficiency and you get the level 1 feat (also the heavy armor proficiency if you want it).  You're basically trading 2 feats for +3 to saves. *Sigh* nobody gives the fighter the respect it deserves.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 08/24/06 19:16</span></i></p>

As for great sword and not kama, for rping purposes and storyline of this character, the great sword was a legendary weapon that devastated, hence dev crit feat, its evil enemies. Not only that, its a great adventure for this character in my book to find this sword then learn how to wield it.

Why? Well in the story, Hikaru's master was killed by an agent of Bane, hence the symbol of the black fist squeezing the green rays. So it was only right that he joined the side of Torm and became Torm's instrument against Bane. When he finds the great sword that his master was talking about, he uses his training as a monk and warrior to excel in mastering the weapon. Other than that, yes, fighter would have been a good choice, but this is after all the only build I could find with these 3 classes.

Yup, Fighter would completely outmatch this CoT, because you don't have CHA for your Lay on Hands, Smite, or Divine Wrath, and for the matter of feaqts, as Mithdradates already explained. But RP is RP... and when dealing RP power comes second.<br><br>Well, I'll be damned, but how do you manage to make a Stunning Fist with a Greatsword, that just can't be done.

He gets the Monk abilities he wants early, and uses the later levels to keep his skills at an acceptable level.

Ya, the stunning fist really isn't that great, except vs low level enemies or players, but with 140% speed, this allows you to run up to an enemy with fists, attempt to stun it with your 5 attacks per round, and if this doesn't work, switch to your great sword, and just lay it to waste with a dev or raw dmg.<br><br>Thanks for the great feedback guys, I appreciate it.

seriously there is ACTUALLY a decent build behind this, however you could make the following change:<br><br>pre-epic; monk 1-8, CoT 9-12<br><br>you would gain 1 BAB <b>FREE</b><br><br>Normally this would cost you 1 feat as you are shifting CoT bonus feat from Epic to Pre-Epic, however you take Blind Fight at level 39 &amp; Imp Crit at lvl 22, either of these could be taken as your extra pre-epic CoT bonus feat!<br><br><i>EDIT : CoT FTW...Champion of Torm is a prestige class which means you would not get an XP penalty where as you would if you took fighter levels....of course if the race was anything but Human <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  </i><br><br><i>EDIT II : Monk 12 gives an extra bonus to speed, which if skillpoints were rearranged to give junk stealth would definately help in CSing no-detect tanks!</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By krsboss on 08/27/06 11:31</span></i></p>

I ask now here for epic character builders and not for myslef..wot is csing and cant i counter it by using trueseeing? <br>And wouldnt charisma help me inthat build as i could use the cot feat. Also it is very useful for social skill like appraise and bluff! Wouldnt that be better than putting a few points into stealth? <br>Although personally i think dirty fighting and zenarchery would be great for this build . you should consider fitting that in!

<img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">     <br><br>ok now lets get serious , sorry for that BS <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    <br><br><br>1. For your 1st build , its pretty good..well done! Nice ab too ! Gratz ..you have potential!<br><br>2. krsboss: tztz...you need 7BAB to qualify for COT so takin it earlier than on lvl 11 isnt possible. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    <br><br>3. What I would really change now , as I am a fan of mini maxing.. drop wis to 8 and start with 18str to get +1ab and 48dev dc(with +12str). Your AC suxs anyway ..even with +12dex/wis. Your ac is your offense and your speed in that build. <br>The crossclassed taunt is worthless in my opinon , leave that to others with a maxed skill ..you also have no cha which adds to taunt. <br>The suggestion of krsboss to put skillpoints into hide /ms is very good , vs no detect tanks 20in both is enough. Speed and csing helps a lot..also nets you +2ab flanking bonus (for imp kd /disarm - see below)and you hit vs flatfooted ac...with that ab a sure hit.<br>I think the 22sr  you get of 12monk isnt that great, with 10monk you get the same ac ,just loose some speed. Takin 8COT instead of 6would grant you an extra feat and +4saves! <br>An extra feat would be very useful , b/C you really should get IMP.DISARM - you use a large weapon which gives you a huge bonus on disarm checks! A disarmed opponent can either run ,fight unarmed or try to pick his weapon up which will makehim flatfooted ...and with those huge crits hes dead by trying...sadly even with 8 cot your still 1 feat short  for imp disarm.<br><br>Now to really squeeze the last out of it you should replace COT with fighter...so you can still go with 12 -6-22 , fit in imp disarm (no need for martial as stated previously +fighter gets a bonus feat on lvl 1 = 2 feats = IMP DISARM! ).<br>Also you could go 4monk6fighter 10wm preepic granting you a BAB of 29...thats 2ab more.<br>some will say get epic weapon spec..meh you got more than enough offensive capabilties..full ab FTW.<br><br>now with +12str and +5weapon,bless /aid (as you used as example ) you would get an AB of:<br>29bab+18str+4wf,ewf,ep+5wm ab bonus+5weapon ab +2bless aid of 63.That combined with lvl 12 monk speed ,some junk stealth and impdisarm/imp kd spam is deadly.<br>If needed you can free up another feat by going 8f 10monk and get epic skill focus disc, depends on the items you can get on your server.<br><br>So in total you would get +3ab/+1dev dc/-3saves and imp disarm!up to you if you think its worth it.<br><br>and dont count so much on div wraith , if you can max cha after maxing str dex con and wis..it will only last 5rnds...<br><br>oh and 8f10monk as halforc gives you even 1ab/1dev dc more..though you have to drop con to 8 to get 13 int.but meh 49dev dc and 64ab wiht your listed buffs o_O<br><br>Now some might say ..you already have enough ab...some say they are pros and 43hide is wtftehpwnage for a sneaker..thats BS , every point counts !<br><br>Well again, nicely done ! <br><br>Cheers<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By bloodymerc on 08/28/06 14:34</span></i></p>

Thanks again for all the support, I really appeciate it. However, there are already plent of monk/ftr/wm builds, so I wanted to do something a little creative with a roleplaying twist to it. My first try at this build was Monk9/CoT10/21wm, which atm I dont have the stats, but it wasn't to bad. Anyway, other than that, this character makes for a great story and fun adventure.<br>Thanks again for all the replies.
