The Holy Wall (9 Paladin/ 13 Weapon Master/ 18 Dwarven Defender)<br><br><b>playable 1 - 40 PvM only</b><br><br>I first looked for this kind of build with pulse cap's search engine, and couldn't find one.  Now I know why.  <br><br>It's a very feat starved build.  I can imagine (and tried out) a number of different level combinations, and this one looked the best.  <br><br>I tried this as an experiment, to see if this combination of classes would work.  Well, they do, kinda.  Not as good as I hoped for though, but not bad either.<br><br>I worked it up in the beginner to epic character leveler, I just haven't had the chance to start playing it yet, as I just thought of it tonight.  So I'm not sure exactly how hard it will be to level him.  But I'll find out soon.<br><i>The character I started is now 17th level, and I have had no problems with him. He handles each situation well. So far I'm having alot of fun with him.<br><br>So, as it stands now, I would say that he is a good character, with excellent RP benefits, and good combat skills. As long as he is played smart (as with any character I guess), he should have no problem reaching 40th level.</i><br><br>I know I could have changed some stats around, used different feats, etc.  But my idea was for this character to be able to do a little of everything of each of the classes, but still be able to fight decently, and defend well.  <br><br>So he can cast some spells, smite some bad guys, heal a bit, turn undead a few times, etc.  More of a party fighter than a loner.<br><br>He was meant more for an RP world than a Hack-n-Slash world, but overall, I think he could survive pretty well in both.<br><br>As usual, any comments or suggestions are appreciated.   A different level combo, or feat choice to improve this character would be good, but the classes are written in stone.<br><br>I now present, as it is,         <br><br>The Holy Wall (9 Paladin/ 13 Weapon Master/ 18 Dwarven Defender)<br><br>Race: Dwarf<br>Alignment: Lawful/Good<br><br>Starting stats:<br><br>Str: 14 <br>Dex: 13<br>Con: 14<br>Wis: 12<br>Int: 13<br>Cha: 12<br><br><br>Leveling<br><br>1 Paladin (1) - Weapon Focus<br>2 Paladin (2)<br>3 Paladin (3) - Dodge<br>4 Paladin (4) - +1 CON<br>5 Paladin (5)<br>6 Paladin (6) - Toughness<br>7 Paladin (7)<br><br>8 Dwarven Defender (1) - +1 Con<br>9 Dwarven Defender (2) - Expertise<br>10 Dwarven Defender (3)<br>11 Dwarven Defender (4)<br>12 Dwarven Defender (5) - Mobility / +1 CON<br>13 Dwarven Defender (6)<br>14 Dwarven Defender (7)<br>15 Dwarven Defender (8) - Spring Attack<br>16 Dwarven Defender (9) - +1 Con<br>17 Dwarven Defender (10)<br><br>18 Paladin (8) - Whirlwind [Make sure Intimidate is 4 by this level]<br><br>19 Weapon Master (1)<br>20 Weapon Master (2) - +1 CON<br>21 Weapon Master (3) - Great CON I<br>22 Weapon Master (4) <br>23 Weapon Master (5)<br>24 Weapon Master (6) - Epic Damage Reduction I / +1 CON<br>25 Weapon Master (7)<br><br>26 Dwarven Defender (11)<br>27 Dwarven Defender (12) - Epic Damage Reduction II<br>28 Dwarven Defender (13) - +1 STR<br>29 Dwarven Defender (14) - Epic Damage Reduction III<br>30 Dwarven Defender (15) - Epic Weapon Focus<br>31 Dwarven Defender (16)<br>32 Dwarven Defender (17) - +1 STR<br>33 Dwarven Defender (18) - Great Strength I / Epic Prowess<br><br>34 Weapon Master (8)<br>35 Weapon Master (9)<br>36 Weapon Master (10) - Great Strength II / +1 STR<br>37 Weapon Master (11)<br>38 Weapon Master (12)<br>39 Weapon Master (13) - Great Strength III / Epic Toughness I<br><br>40 Paladin (9) - +1 CON<br><br><br>Ending stats:<br><br>Str: 20 <br>Dex: 13<br>Con: 22<br>Wis: 12<br>Int: 13<br>Cha: 12 <br><br><br>Skills: 117 points total (not counting your starting skills)<br><br>Start with:<br><br>Discipline: 4<br>Itimidate: 2<br>Tumble and Spellcraft: 1 each<br><br>End with: <br><br>Discipline: 40<br>Intimidate: 4<br>Tumble: 20<br>Spellcraft: 20<br><br>and 1 point left over...don't spend it all in one place<br><br><br>Base Attack: 30<br><br><br>HP: 736 with Max Rolls<br><br><br>AC: Naked - 11 + 4 Tumble = 15 / With mundane plate and tower shield: 22 + 4 tumble = 26<br><br><br>AB: +41/+36/+31/+26 (With mundane weapon of choice)<br><br><br>Saves ..start/end<br><br>Fortitude: 5/ 30<br>Reflex: 2/ 20<br>Will: 2/ 21<br><br>Damage Reduction: DD of 12 + EDR of 9 = Total of 21<br><br><br>Well, there it is.  <br><br>Rooker<br>_________________<br>With great strength comes great power.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 01/25/06 18:14</span></i></p>
