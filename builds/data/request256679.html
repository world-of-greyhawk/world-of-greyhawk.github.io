Curious what people think would be a good 3rd class and class split for a Barbarian/Sorceror.  Red Dragon Disciple seems to be the classic move, but there are bound to be some other interesting ideas.<br><br>So...  What classes would you suggest and what advantages would they have.  Certainly theme is an advantage...<br><br>I guess I'm really not so much looking for builds as general ideas on where to go.

Obvious choice would be Paladin, but it would require an alignment shift.<br><br>Bard could work as well.<br><br>Perhaps CoT, to take advantage of the CHA modifier.<br><br>Pale Master could also work out.<br><br>Really depends on if you're going heavy SOR or heavy Barbarian.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Could always go just Barb/Sorc.  Barb15/Sorc25.  Sucks on feats, but you could go Barb12/Sorc8 pre-epic, and then TR and Damage shields in Epic.  It'd be off the beaten path, but playable methinks.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Base classes in general seem a bad idea due to possibilities for an XP penalty, but that's just me being biased.<br><br>Bard seems a reduplication of effort to me, it covers more or less what the sorceror already does.<br><br>For some reason pale master had not crossed my mind before, but the combat bonuses are rather helpful (even if not gaining spells sucks)<br><br>Really, I think the Blackguard is more an obvious choice.  You're going to want to pick up Cleave anyway to take the Divine feats, so that's not a big downside.  Plus the alignment shift becomes mute.  Otherwise it seems as good to dip into as paladin.<br><br>griz, I was actually thinking that, is 1 shy of undispellable bad?  It really hurts to miss out on that epic feat, but you can get terrifying rage...

25 levels is enough to be undispellable.<br><br>I don't think Bard duplicates much actually. With your limited spell selection as a SOR, you can round out your spell list with Bard spells. You also get Song boosts as well. However, the drawback is you need to invest a significant number of levels into Bard to make it really worthwhile, which means few BBN or SOR levels.<br><br>Blackguard's a good idea though, and should work well. I'd overlooked that.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

He could go bard 16, sorcerer 9 or 8, Barb 15 or 16...<br><br>But it would have save problems at low levels, and possibly be very succeptable to Will save spells (covered by Protection versus alignment).<br><br>Alternatively, Bard 8 / Barb 16 / BG 16 would work well. Bard for Keen Edge, +2 AB song, and a few buffs. BG for a few extra epic feats. Barb for the rage of course. This might be better for the saves than the first build, but it will be more restricted in spells per day, and might have problems getting every useful buff, but it would be able to pre-load a sequencer thanks to UMD from bard, and be able to get flame weapon and other useful short term buffs off of UMD.<br><br>EDIT: not to even mention Divine Feats you could get, for more damage and possibly AC, and the bard helps here for possible tumble dumps later in epics.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Freedom-Fighta on 10/29/06 01:49</span></i></p>

Bard/Barbarian/Black Guard sort of lacks sorceror and therefore deviates from the topic a bit, but decent info anyway.

Sorc/Barb/Blackguard for saves and a stackable str bonus.
