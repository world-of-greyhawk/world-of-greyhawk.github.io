I went weapon master because I don't remember conan ever using anything besides his bastard sword. I had to take a bit of creative license, since you can't wield a bastard sword in 2 hands in this game, so I gave him a great sword instead.<br>this character has a slow uptake, he takes a while to start gaining really powerful abilities. however the barbarian rage feats mixed with the critical feats with some weapon master levels seems interesting to me.<br>final numbers (while raging, cuz when would he not be?)<br>str : 32<br>dex : 14<br>con : 20<br>wis : 8<br>int : 14<br>cha : 10<br>intimidate (dc for his terrifying rage will save) : 53 + roll (how many fighters can make a will save of 53? you have to be 2x his level to not be effected by this, and when you're scared you can be sneak attacked, since you're considered flat footed (i think?))<br>hit points : 546 with dr 5/-<br>damage : <br>2-12 + 16 (15-20/x3 crit) plus sneak attacks if applicable.<br>on a crit, he does:<br>6-36 + 48 + 2d6 overwhelming crit + 2d6 thundering rage + 50% chance of being deafened + fortitude save or die.<br>he's not suitable to fight casters in pvp most times. his will save is too low (like conan's would be?) and he has too few hit points to stand up to many spells. he's much more effective fighting other fighters.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/10/07 14:48</span></i></p>

Excellent!  Will be using the same three classes for my upcoming "Psycho Killer" build.  Any reason why you have 10 WM levels?  IIRC, there aren't any special feats or bonuses between level 7 and 13.

Just an FYI, I don't think concentration is a class skill for any of those three classes. You could still raise ti to 20 though of course. Otherwise looks like fun. I did a slightly different approach to a rogue barbarian about a week ago that's down the page a bit called master of scare tactics.
