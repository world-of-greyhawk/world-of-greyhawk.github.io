My guess is it has to do with the run up to the NWN2 release.  Many of the builders here are checking the NWN2 boards so that they can get head start on building characters.  Also, it is getting harder to find builds that haven't been done.  I know a few combos, but I'm saving those for the next few weeks.<br><br>In other guilds, I'm guessing there is a lot of conversation going on about what they are going to do once NWN2 comes out.  So generally inactive guilds are becoming active and our little guild is quieting down a bit.  <br><br>A couple of months after NWN2s release, when there is no new content and players come back to NWN to wait for mods to be released by the community.  Our guild will regain its favored position.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

I think basically it's what Mith said: fewer and fewer builds that haven't already been done and people are turning their attention toward NWN2 at the moment. But does it matter where the Guild ranks? If people want to find character builds, they'll find their way here eventually.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

We were RANKED!!!!<br><br>Really, in the grand scheme of life, who cares!  We know we are the best!  We have had some of the best (and worst) people come and go from our ranks!   We dont ever need others to justify our existence!  I must say that this has been a wonderful guild and I have always looked forward to loggin in to check what you guys/gals have to say.  What more can you ask for?<br><br>Just my two cents.   *but really, they have things to rank guilds!
