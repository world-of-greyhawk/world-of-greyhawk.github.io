I'd be keen to know this builds stats as unequipped.  Things like final DC, etc.<br><br>also, you don't really mention (or I've missed it), are you going general school or selecting a particular school?

Actually, this build would gain a lot more if it was Wizard 35/HS 5. Why? Well:<br><br>1. Harper Scouts get discipline, hide, move silently, tumble, and listen as class skills so you don't need to take the fighter and rogue levels. Unfortunetly, Harpers don't get spot or UMD, but as a wizard you probably won't need to use UMD very much.<br><br>2. You get one epic wizard bonus feat and two epic feats from the Harper Scout list, which includes Great Dexterity (more AC).<br><br>3. You don't have the requirements to wear heavy armor, so you can trade in the auto-still spell feats and take Great Intelligence feats instead.<br><br>4. The Harper spell Cat's Grace stacks with the wizard spell Cat's Grace so you can reach the +12 limit a lot easier.<br><br>So basically you sacrifice evasion and a few hit points for higher spell DC (being able to take more Great Intelligence feats) and higher AC (from the Harper Scout).

I have been looking at your idea for about 5 mins now.  I have to wonder why you chose the classes you did?  <br>Reason: you took 4 ftr levels, but i dont really see the value in that choice?  You basically used fightr lvls to gain expertise and epic toughness and the use of martial wpns and heavy armor.  The thing is, wearing heavy armor negates the rogue evasion, and if you want to carry a longsword, take the race elf.<br><br>If you have the expansions, you may want to look at your build, subbing pale master for fighter (unless you have a reason that is unstated).  Id suggest a lvling progression 4wiz/10pm/5wiz/1rog to lvl 20.  Palemaster gives gives you an ability that fighter cannot: immunity to criticals!  among others.  You would finish 27wiz/10pm/3 rog not quite as high a DC as you have in your build, but would give you better protection than the heavy armor would.  The other reason i suggest this is that you have made no selection for a weapon for fighting without magic, so based on that i do not see why ftr is that important.  Oh, i almost forgot, being a prestige class, pm would also put you out of the dreaded xp penalty that an elf ftr/wiz/rog would have.<br><br>hope that helps<br><br>Peace

Ok, <br>Here goes.<br><br>The fighter is there for the following reasons:<br>1. Armor<br>2. 3 feats in 4 levels.<br>3. Hps.<br><br>The persistant world I am playing in does not allow devastating crits, and it seems that every other creature in the game casts dispell magic. UMD is critical on this world because lots of the good items are specific to classes that are not in this build or not good for this build.<br><br>Second, attack bonuses have to be incredibly high to hit some of these guys, like upper 80's, while magic has no problem.<br><br>For my world these are the classes that give this build the best chance. I want these classes. Early armor with expertise makes a caster incredibly durable, later UMD makes the build versatile on the world I play.<br><br>I took three levels of rogue at different high levels to max UMD as the character moves up and to make it so that I can never be flat-footed. Evasion is almost useless at higher levels as I do not have the dex to make it work, so armor with mods is a better deal. Oh,I cannot stress enough how important spot and search are on the world I play.<br><br>I welcome the comments, keep them coming. I think the builds on here are great, I just think that some builds have to be built for worlds that have custom rules.<br><br>-Pendragon<br><br>Second,<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Pendragon2u on 12/23/04 22:35</span></i></p>

Hi Pendragon2u,<br><br>First of all, I think it's great you noted this build is for your PW in particular thus may not be a good build in other PW's.<br><br>Secondly, if you're looking for heavy armor, I would suggest getting it from Blackguard or Champion of Torm rather than fighter. Both would give you martial weapons and heavy armor but without the experience penalty wizard/fighter/rogue would bring. Alternatively, I think you could take assassin instead of rogue to get UMD (go Wizard/Fighter/Assassin).<br><br>And with so many levels of wizard I think you get plenty of feats - I don't think the 20 levels of third class XP penalty is worth "3 feats in 4 levels".<br><br>Thirdly (very minor note), you have a typo: you have Epic Spell Focus: Evoc twice (at level 21 and 22). One of those is (I'm sure) Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy.<br><br>Interesting build. Thanks for posting it and I hope you get good feedback.<br><br>Kaliban<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kaliban99 on 12/24/04 14:48</span></i></p>

Ah, now im understanding it!<br>The only thing i'd add or change though is this: you mentioned you took ftr for the AB!  To maximize this take all 4 ftr levels before 20.  If you take them, say as your first 4 lvls, then you would have 4 atts/rd at 20!  <br><br>I do like the idea of taking CoT of blackguard, but taking these with a wiz base, wouldnt allow you to start these lvls after 13, which doesnt give enough time to get 4atts.  So the other option is to get rog/ftr lvls to 4/3 at 20, thus negating the xp penalty (if thats imprtnt to you), then take 4 rog at 20 to max the skills.  That will give you 4ftr/4rog/32 wiz.  <br><br>That would give you everything you askd for.<br><br>Peace
