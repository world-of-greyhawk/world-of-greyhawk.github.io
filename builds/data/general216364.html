I have a build with Sorcerer and Palemaster in it. Doesn't the Palemaster give the sorcerer extra slots anymore? Or has he never? I took 10 sorc in the leveler and then rested. 10 PM levels after that and rested again. i didn't have any more spells a day after that. <br><br>Perhaps the cap was reached. 16 CHA and 7 castings/lvl I seem to remember. i have very limited experience with casters.

Hmm I haven't used a sorc/PM before, because of the whole "not learning any new spells as a PM" thing.  <br><br>The max spells per day a sorcerer gets is 6, plus ability bonus slots.  So it could be you are on a spell level where you have your maximum spells per day plus 1 from ability bonus.  That would be my guess - you just aren't seeing the higher levels because you lack known spells of those levels.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

A level 10 sorcerer can cast 6/6/6/6/5/3 spells per day. A level 15 sorcerer can cast 6/6/6/6/6/6/6/4 spells per day. So as a sorcerer(10)/pale master(10) you can't cast any level 6/7 spells but you should be able to cast 6/6/6/6/6/6 spells per day and you should be able to fill the level 6 spell slot with metamagic (CHA 16 is not enough to use the level 7 slot as well).<br><br>Everything without bonus spell slots because of high charisma of course.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.Detail&amp;id=856" target="_blank">Character Build Calculator</a>(works with Excel, Open Office) 2.83: updated to NWN 1.69.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kamiryn on 10/13/05 12:26</span></i></p>

Thank you. So the level 6 slots is usable for metamagic then. I will have to check it again, perhaps i didn't look hard enough the first time. thanks both.
