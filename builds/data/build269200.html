This build presumes you'll be able to get almost all abilities maxed with craftable gear upon epic.  But the build should be good in almost any setting (clerics are like that).  If you are in love with your cleric weapon buffs, you can go kama.  I like not being able to be disarmed &gt;.&gt;<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 03/29/07 11:47</span></i></p>

since this is not a DC caster, why not <br>C29/SD2/M9?<br><br>what's the benefit in taking six more cleric levels?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By dust7 on 03/26/07 19:26</span></i></p>

It's a fair point.  You get Greater Wisdom III and IV for free and you need one of them to cast Level 9 spells and the other for the AC bonus from your monk class.  Obviously, you get the benefit of the six caster levels and two AB points from the War Domain (mind the cap, however).  That compromise certainly inspired the V.2, which takes Monk to 6 to pick up IKD.  Taking it to 9 would pick up Improved Evasion and would increase your damage.

Two things I think I'd do differently, upon reflection.  <br><br>One, take Blind Fight instead of Great Fortitude. <br><br>Two, take Epic Prowess and ESF: Concentration instead of Great Strength III and IV.  <br><br>Ithacan

Yes, I've pm'd Grimnir and Griphook to fix that.  The AB will be one less regardless of which way you go (I recommend taking the EP route).
