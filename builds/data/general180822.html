First of all, thanks for accepting my request to join this guild <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   Hey Anuis!!  <br><br>Alright, to my request: <br><br>Up until SoU came out, which was about the time I started a serious attempt at making a high-level, story-driven hack 'n' slash module, I considered myself very knowledgeable in all the base classes.

Use Ctrl-F to do a Find, and then enter something like, RDD, AA, PM, CoT, etc.  You'll find plenty of PrC builds, and this should give you some idea of the characters that people tend to play.  <br><br>Hope that was helpful.

Thanks, mate.  I'll do as you suggest re PrCs, and of course I've got the manual.  What I *don't* have is time to investigate all the classes themselves.<br><br>The class-based item-sets are basically just that.  A fighter set contains all 9 wearable items, for example.  A clerical one has 10, including a shield.  My problem, really, is that I had to make some hard decisions about these sets.  The fighter one has heavy armour, for example, whereas many fighters are dex-based characters, and in my understanding a weapon master uses medium or light armour???  So what I'm after is some solid feedback from people well-versed in the possibilities of multi-classing, especially regarding the prestige classes.<br><br>It would be easy to make a mini-mod with all these sets in them, if people here would be interested in looking at it.  What my intentions are in Caereena is to make, say, a couple of different variations of the armour etc so that people can choose what they prefer.  Script-wise etc not so hard to do and implement *if* I knew what I was doing with the actual objects...<br><br>Let me know if you guys would be willing to check this stuff out.  Both this Guild and anyone here who participates will be fully creditted for any help provided.<br><br>Cheers!<br>_________________<br>(the halfling paladin bows deeply..)

I am not sure if it would be done like the way I am thinking of...<br><br>If multiple versions are wanted for each different type of character ie; a fighter that relies on Dex or a fighter that relies on Str, etc etc...<br><br>Why not make a check for that, such as if this character has more Dex than Str check, etc, then you create a items according to what the dominant ability is.<br><br>You can make all pre-set items that has different variation.<br><br>Ie; Fighter's Bracers. If the character is Dex based, then you add the property that adds the Dex. If it is Str based instead, it will add Str property instead.<br><br>This might be too complicated to do.<br><br>Just a suggestion that I had.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.

It's a good thought, Anuis, and I thank you for it.  I'll put it to my coders.  We already check for class, race, feats etc etc in a magic armoury and I don't see why an ability would be any different.  It's a sweet idea <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>But I *still* need to know how to make this stuff.  The sets are basically good things.  Cover all the bases whilst yet remaining relatively low level.  I'd just like some feedback from players with a whole bunch of various builds if possible.  I could do all this myself with an auto-leveler and get some basic feel for it, but that isn't the same as actually having played a build in a combat scenario....And I really don't have the time.  Caereena needs this stuff asap, and we are already gearing up for the sequel...<br><br>Anyway, I'm a new member and haven't actually given this guild anything to warrant such help, and I know you must be all busy people as am I.  You especially, Anuis.  I'm aware that you're making your own mod <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   But I ask anyway and will repay this guild as I can.

What is expected in it, such as, would there be more fighting than puzzle solving, would there be critcal hit immune creatures, etc etc.<br><br>Then based on what is answered, we could give you better idea of what classes that might be used mostly in the mod. Because of how the mod is made, we have our own builds that we use for certain mods because of how it is built, such as is it geared more toward to rogue builds, etc etc. Or if it is general mod, we go by how hard it is and so on...<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<br>Anyway, I'm a new member and haven't actually given this guild anything to warrant such help, and I know you must be all busy people as am I.
