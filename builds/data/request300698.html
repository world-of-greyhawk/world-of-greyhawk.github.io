STR based human monk is not very specific.

Thanks for the link Kail <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">  , but i was wanting to utilise the cleric class for the wisdom, if at all possible.<br><br>Apart from the obvious casting ability of the cleric, would there be much difference between your and, say, a monk/cleric/rogue?

If SR is important to your character, you still have more to gain from more monk lvls.<br>You didn't say how much wisdom you have given your monk, but if it is 14 or more, you could take 7-10 levels of cleric just to exploit Divine Power. If you take strenght domain you have DP as both lvl 3 and 4 spells. If you take the extend spell feat you can extend DP in your lvl 4 and 5 slots. Then they will last long enough to be worth it.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

Thanks Mick, I realised this after I had started out on the monk route. My Wisdom is at 21 at the moment. Apart from strength domain, which other would you recommend?

I probably wouldn't recommend cleric at all this late, but if you go for cleric multiclassing the other domain depends on the environment and how many lvls of cleric you take (what spell levels you get access to). Strength domain is the only one that gives extra DP. War is one of my favorites if you can get lvl 7 spells.<br>Beware of the the possible xp penalty since you already have 2 classes in your build.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

Thanks once again Mick, to be honest I am not really too worried about the xp penalty. I will let you know how it turns out.
