What about bumping up pm levels and dropping monk levels to get something along the lines of a 19/5/16 split. Then you can get an epic spell (or two if you do it right). Also how do you do against anything with DR of +4 or higher? I ask because it isn't all that uncommon to see some for of +5 DR even with pvm.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

INT is too low for lvl6 (or above) spells; thus increasing PM levels (besides ac bonus); does not actually benefit the char - the extra monk levels may be more useful.  If you were to add an extra INT point; however; you add a whole new dimension of damage potential to this toon - ShadowShield; Grtr Stoneskin to name a few<br><br>I'm curious - isn't it a prereq to have lvl9 spell capability BEFORE you can pick Epic spells; regardless of PM levels?

<!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Think of Palemaster as a weird little anomaly that allows a caster to be immune from criticals and garner a really excellent AC.</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->You shouldn't think that. Pale Master is a very good addition to any melee build aswell, but somewhat tough to get, as it requires 3 levels in an arcane caster class. This limits your warrior classes to only one (X/Y/PM, X being whatever and Y either Wizard/Sorcerer/Bard), which limits your abilities.<br><br>So now you're thinking what does PM add? Well, 10 levels add 6 AC as well as immunity to Critical Hits, Sneak Attacks, Hold, Stun and Paralyze. 16 levels add 10 points of AC plus up to 3 Epic Spells. When combined with Wizard, you can get alot of spell slots on higher levels which can be filled with spells learned from scrolls (see griz's build The Revenant (?)).<br><br>So in conclusion, Pale Master is a defensive prestige class with alot of immunities and the capability to reach very high AC.<br><br>Ranting here... a speech in favour of PM <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif"> <br><br>EDIT: typos, and forgot to mention the summons, which I have never used <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>Now is my day's work done;<br>I'll take good breath:<br>Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of<br>blood and death.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By FinneousPJ on 12/02/05 19:51</span></i></p>
