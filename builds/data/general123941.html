heh perhaps to make this easier, would there be a way to put in a search function? (or is there one I just dont know how to use? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ) something where a person could type in "Fighter" and all builds with a fighter show up, or a way to have them in groups? Caster groups, damage groups, tanking groups, something like that... I am not good at programming and such at all, hehe I just can make pretty clothes in the toolset, most advanced I can do hehe, but it seems to me it would be a simple thing to do.  Anyone know if this would work?<br>_________________<br>When the Trickster starts a-walking,<br>He sets the whole world askew...<br>Just when you thing that it's all through,<br>It's just the birth of something new.
