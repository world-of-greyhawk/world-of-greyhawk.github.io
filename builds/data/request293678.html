This is my attempt at a Sorcerer build: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "262838", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Graced Sorcerer (Sorcerer 37 / Paladin 1 / Blackguard 2)</a> it's made for very high saves so I believe you can stand Dev Critters without much trouble, it's about the highest fortitude save Sorcerer you'll ever find. You can make the Alignment shift from Lawful Good at the beginning to any evil just right after taking Paladin.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Well, that's complicated, I'm of the theory that everyone should play on its own style, I like wide area attacks when I play arcane casters, and I usually like to have a variety of different elements, Scintillating Sphere, that cone of acid I always forget its name, Ice Storm, Firebrand, Horrid Wilting, so when I face an enemy I always have something prepared that works regardless that it might not be the strongest spells to choose all the time... but sometimes the environment can be important, if you know what kind of enemies you're fighting you can prepare a lot better.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Please help me!</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>That's a bit overboard don't you think? read the spell descriptions and try then out dude, you're the one playing. I can advise you to use Empower Spell or Maximized Spell on spells you like, for PvP I usually stock lots of IGMS, regular, empowered and maximized since it's a powerful spell, but I rarely use IGMS on PvM, it sucks when you're targeting mobs.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/16/08 05:33</span></i></p>

Ok willworms i play on BoW,<br>And the BoW forums are really good to get builds that are for BoW if you check the Best Build Contest i think about 2 competitions ago a high AC mage won. Also lots of useful links there and its easier for people who play on BoW to help you than for those who dont know what its like <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif"> <br><br>Hope this will help you reduce the amount of topics you start on here <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_redface.gif"> <br><br>Also i wouldnt play a sorc as my first character on BoW - you are worth points even to 40s when level 28 (BoW is an Evil Vs Good server <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> ) check out cows.own.cz then go to help for new characters - i recommend a Str WM using the Chaos shield when you get to 40 or a risen.
