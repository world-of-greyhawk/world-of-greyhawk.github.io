I would take another ranger level towords the end to max discipline and perhaps move silently.

A nice idea. I've been messing about with shifter builds that don't include monk and they are hard work. I think PulseCap is right about including a ranger level at the end to max out Discipline. 13th level Druid would still get 7th level spells and as a minor bonus you'd get an extra favoured enemy.<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

Aye, as I said in the other topic, you could use the lv 38 druid level to take ranger instead and pick up epic prowess and max all the ranger skills as well, that will make the epic kobold a truly amazing sneaker.<br><br>Looks excellent and full of fun though.

OK, I have now checked out the "other topic" and found that many of my ideas had already been discussed there. I guess I should have had a look at it before posting, but if you want people to look at another discussion before posting you might want to add a link to it.

Another idea might be to swop WF &amp; IC from Longbow to Shortsword. Then you could duel-wield in human form, and your kobold commando form (which will probably be the one you spend most time in) would also benefit.<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

Yeah, I agree not using monk in a shifter build seems difficult, because alot of times all the wisdom to get the epic shapes really seems wasted unless going monk for the ac. I agree with taking the Ranger level last and will change that.<br><br>     I played with the idea of wp focus short sword etc, but feel with zen archery at least I'm using the high wisdom for something. Also when in human form he is more of a wisdom archer and spell caster. Then he'll shift when he goes into melee to risen or gargoyle whatever, or shift into kobold use hipps and get distance before starting to shoot arrows again. He can also set traps etc and lead monsters into the traps by shooting them. You get the idea. I tried to make him to be a flexible character with many different options.

hmmm, I'm trying to check the build by re-building it and having trouble using those starting stats. I'm having to start with 12 wisdom and will end with 25 wis and 17 con. I think. I'll have to level it up again and see, might be missing an attribute level up point or something.<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick.

Looks like you have to use these stats :<br>STR 14<br>Dex 14<br>Con 15 (16)<br>Int 14<br>Wis 12 (26)<br>Cha 8<br> <br>Then switch level 20 stat increase to wisdom from con and the build will work. You just have less hp's. I don't understand what went wrong with this character because I built him originally then leveled him back down to level one to get my starting stats that I originally posted. Maybe for some reason the leveler module didn't reduce the stats corrcetly back to level one. Anyway, you could also reduce str to start at 12 and leave it there putting those stats into con and have the extra hp's, whatever you like. I just feel like a wimp with 12 str though lol.<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick.

Hard to say, really.  I've never built a Druid/Shifter in my life, so take what I say with a grain of salt.  However, I would take only 4 levels of Ranger pre-epic, and then use the 5th level of Ranger in Epic to pick up another combat feat, like EWF, or Armor Skin if it makes the Ranger list.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

The ranger seems to get pretty sad epic bonus feats however. I think the following are the only ones that would be availible with your stats and other feats:<br><br><b>Epic toughness</b><br>20 HP at the expense is not even worth the 1 BAB, IMO<br><b>Epic Weapon Focus</b><br>This would mean +1 AB with longbow but -1 AB with any other weapon. It pretty much comes down to how often you'll be using the longbow<br><b>Favored enemy</b><br>Could be nice, but not worth it on the whole I think<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By pulse cap on 07/05/05 01:55</span></i></p>
