You get an AB and an Epic Feat from level 22 WM but nothing from levels 23-24 except a few HP. I'd suggest putting them into bard.

A question about this build.  I have tried pushing back WM 3 levels and taking all the RDD so as to take martial weapon prof and use a warhammer and shield, but then I only make 15BAB by 20 (3 attacks <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  ).  I feel it is not possible to take martial and get 4 attacks with these classes?  Can someone tell me, is it worth using a mace (i always like bludgeoning) and shield, is it possible to get 4 attacks with a warhammer, or would you just continue using a spear??  (Question Posted in separate thread too)
