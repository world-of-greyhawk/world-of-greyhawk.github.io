I think it was a good contest whether it was melee AB or not.  It took a long time to come up with a character that was even 1 AB higher than yours, archer or not, and I can't think of any way to get higher than this.  Dropping Druid or Bard for AA results in a net loss of AB, but taking more of either one gets you nothing.<br><br>This is most certainly close enough that, if "everyone knows" that an Arcane Archer has the highest AB, "everyone" would do well to check his or her knowledge, 'cause it's a very near thing.

Closer than what I thought possible. The build I posted grew out of a discussion of best AB possible in the normal forums, and we were discussing melee. That aside, reaching AB in the high 90's, no matter the criteria, is nice. Starting to think of it, you had the +7 from WM + the +9 from smite to beat. Plus Taunt. AA cuts close on it's own, with +15(and great dex feats for +2 more), then add +2 from Druid, but then you lose 3 from BAB, another 1 from size. Finding the perfect balance was well done indeed, with curse song tipping it in your favor.<br><br>Well, then for someone else to beat this challenge. pity you can't smite with ranged <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

If this build uses Balgaran's Iron Horn to knockdown an opponent and then gets a max attack. It would get a +4 AB boost vs. prone opponents for a grand total of 101.  The melee build could manage this boost with a knockdown attack too, so it doesn't really change anything but the totals.<br><br>I would like to add congrats to Grimnir and Nimueh for their excellent builds.  They really pushed the limits of min/maxing to create these builds.

Actually prone opponents are -4 to hit for ranged attacks, the +4 is just for melee.

Personally I do not think that you can count Cursing and Taunting into an attack bonus as they are deceases to AC rather than an actual attack bonus!<br><br>If there was to be a contest you would have to have different categories:<br><br>1) Maximum SHORT term buffed AB (divine wrath, true strike, war domain all have limited uses &amp; short duration)<br><br>2) Maximum SELF buffed AB (highest AB obtainable without any external influences)<br><br>3) Maximum AB in a low-medium magic enviroment (limited weapon enhancement with ability buffing items)<br><br>4) Maximum AB in a high magic enviroment (+20 weapons &amp; +12 to dex/str/wis)<br><br>5) Maximum SUSTAINABLE AB (highest AB that can be sustained for extended combat periods)

Actually the "effective AB" can get higher than +4 vs knocked down opponents, cause their AC loses all dodge, tumble and dex AC (they keep dex AC if they have UD). A fighter in full plate with +5 gear will lose 10 AC (5 dodge AC, 4 tumble, 1 dex), 9 if he has UD. Therefore the effective AB goes up by a whopping +14. Even an archer, in such instances would get a bonus to effective AB of +10 (+14 -4 ranged AB vs prone targets). Getting KD ain't pleasant.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free
