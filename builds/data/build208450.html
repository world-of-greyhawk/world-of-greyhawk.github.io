<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 PvM or PvP Lite</b><br><br>This infernal wench from Hell has a bit to offer those sneaky melee players who want to crush the opponent, and crush them quickly.  Thanks to Stealthy feat, 2 skill foci and 2 Epic Skill Foci, Infernal Mistress can sneak in Full Plate just as well as a Dex-based Rogue build.  In so doing, she can launch an Improved Knockdown sneak attack, and deliver tremendous blows that not only deliver 11d6 sneak dice, but +15 Strength damage and +6EWS damage followed by Improved Critical, Overwhelming Critical and Devastating Critical.  She can summon an ungodly beast from the Abyss, an Epic Vrock, that rends its opponents to shreds, and while the enemy tries to deal with this Epic Fiend, the Mistress can deliver sneak attack upon Dev Crit upon sneak upon Dev Crit until nothing remains but pulp. <br><br>She can further fortify herself with Bulls Strength, and can cast up to 9th level scrolls without failure with a 35UMD.  Against those wily high AC opponents, she can Taunt with an impressive 53Taunt skill and drop their AC by 6, which effectively raises your AB by 6.  <br><br>His Infernal Mistress suffers from MHPS (mediocre hitpoint syndrome). 460 hit points isn't bad, but as a point of reference, I have an Epic Dodging SC V character who gets 500 hit points(he's a bit of a freak), so I measure all hit points against him.<br><br>However, in the non Dev-crit version(see below), Toughness is taken over Great Cleave(and gains 500 Hp), and Improved Sneak I and II are taken in place of Over Crit and Dev Crit.<br><br><br><b>His Infernal Mistress</b><br>Human Female<br>Rogue5/Fighter10/BG25<br>Alignment: Lawful/Misunderstood<br><br>Str16(30)<br>Int14<br>Wis8<br>Dex12<br>Con14<br>Chr12<br><br>1Rogue1, Knockdown, Stealthy<br>2Fighter1, Weapon Focus: Great Sword<br>3Fighter2, Power Attack, Cleave<br>4Fighter3, Str17<br>5Fighter4, WS: Great Sword<br>6Fighter5, Blindfighting<br>7Rogue2<br>8Blackguard1, Str18<br>9Blackguard2, Improved Knockdown<br>10Fighter6, Improved Critical: Great Sword<br>11Blackguard3<br>12Blackguard4, SF: Move Silently, Str19<br>13Blackguard5<br>14Blackguard6<br>15Blackguard7, Skill Focus: Hide<br>16Blackguard8, Str20<br>17Rogue3<br>18Blackguard9, Great Cleave<br>19Blackguard10<br>20Fighter7, Str21<br>21Fighter8, Great Str I, EWF<br>22Fighter9<br>23Blackguard11<br>24Fighter10, Great Str II, EWS: Great Sword, Str24<br>25Blackguard12<br>26Blackguard13, Overwhelming Critical<br>27Rogue4, Great Str III<br>28Blackguard14, Str26<br>29Blackguard15<br>30Blackguard16, Great Str IV, Devastating Critical<br>31Blackguard17<br>32Blackguard18, Str28<br>33Blackguard19, ESF: Taunt, Epic Fiendish Servant<br>34Blackguard20<br>35Blackguard21<br>36Blackguard22, ESF: Hide, Epic Prowess, Str29<br>37Blackguard23<br>38Blackguard24<br>39Blackguard25, ESF: Move Silently, Armor Skin<br>40Rogue, Str30<br><br>AB: 43/37/32/27 (17-20/x2)<br>Base Damage: 2-12 +6EWS +15Str +2Bulls +11d6sneak<br>Buffed AB: 61(with +6weapon, Taunt, Bulls Strength and +8 to strength)<br>AC: 29<br>AC: 63 with +6 equipment<br>Dev Crit DC: 30(36max)<br><br>Fort: 26<br>Will: 16<br>Reflex: 20<br><br>Hit Points: 460<br>Skill Points: 259<br><br>Hide:43(59)(51 in Full Plate)<br>Move Silently:43(59)(51 in Full Plate)<br>Taunt: 42(53)<br>Tumble: 40<br>Discipline:42(52)<br>UMD: 34(35) can cast 9th lvl scrolls without failure)<br>Listen: 15<br><br><b>Benefits</b><br>Evasion<br>Epic Taunt Skill (53)<br>Bulls Strength<br>Inflict Serious Wounds<br>Inflict Critical Wounds<br>Contagion<br>Solid AB<br>Devastating Critical: DC:30<br>11d6Sneak Attack<br>Excellent Stealth skill while in Full Plate(51)<br>Use Magic Device<br>Blindfighting/Improved Knockdown to take out Casters<br>Smite Do-gooders 1/day for 26 points of damage<br><br>Summon: Epic Fiend: Vrock (21st Level Fighter)<br>AB: 28<br>AC: 26<br>Hit Points: 315<br>Spell Resistance: 22<br>Damage Reduction<br>Damage Resistance<br>Electrical Resistance<br><br>Summon: Doom Knight (9th lvl ftr)<br>AB: 26<br>HP: 76<br>Damage Reduction<br>Immunity to Criticals<br>And other neat features<br><br><b>Weakness</b><br>Low Will Save: fortunately, UMD/Dark Blessing can relieve this burden<br>Mediocre Hit Points(such is the price we pay for Dev Crit)<br>Doesn뇺 make use of Divine Feats or Extra Smiting or Charisma for that matter<br><br>_________<br><br><b>Non Dev-Crit Version</b><br>Str16(30)<br>Int14<br>Wis8<br>Dex12<br>Con14<br>Chr12<br><br>1Rogue1, Knockdown, Stealthy<br>2Fighter1, Weapon Focus: Great Sword<br>3Fighter2, Power Attack, Cleave<br>4Fighter3, Str17<br>5Fighter4, WS: Great Sword<br>6Fighter5, Blindfighting<br>7Rogue2<br>8Blackguard1, Str18<br>9Blackguard2, Improved Knockdown<br>10Blackguard3<br>11Blackguard4<br>12Blackguard5, SF: Move Silently, Str19<br>13Fighter6, Improved Crit: Great Sword<br>14Blackguard6<br>15Blackguard7, Skill Focus: Hide<br>16Blackguard8, Str20<br>17Rogue3<br>18Blackguard9, Toughness<br>19Blackguard10<br>20Fighter7, Str21<br>21Fighter8, Great Str I, EWF<br>22Fighter9<br>23Blackguard11<br>24Fighter10, Great Str II, EWS: Great Sword, Str24<br>25Blackguard12<br>26Blackguard13, Epic Prowess<br>27Rogue4, Great Str III<br>28Blackguard14, Str26<br>29Blackguard15<br>30Blackguard16, Great Str IV, Epic Fiendish Servant<br>31Blackguard17<br>32Blackguard18, Str28<br>33Blackguard19, ESF: Taunt, Armor Skin<br>34Blackguard20<br>35Blackguard21<br>36Blackguard22, ESF: Hide, Improved Sneak I, Str29<br>37Blackguard23<br>38Blackguard24<br>39Blackguard25, ESF: Move Silently, Improved Sneak II<br>40Rogue, Str30<br><br>AB: 43/37/32/27 (17-20/x2)<br>Base Damage: 2-12 +6EWS +15Str +2Bulls +13d6sneak<br>AC: 29<br><br>Fort: 26<br>Will: 16<br>Reflex:20<br><br>Hit Points: 500<br>Skill Points: 259<br><br>All Skill Points the Same<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet?

pretty nifty build griz.  too bad you can't take better advantage of the cha bonus without some nice equipment, but with all the other advantages, i doubt that anyone will mind.<br>now if only i weren't so opposed to evil...not a particular fan of good either, mind you, but still... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-C<br>_________________<br>Do not meddle in the affairs of Dragons, for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.

I've nothing on the build, but you should spell it Greatsword, not Great Sword <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  It kind of changes the meaning, doesn't it? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Now we are talking. Style points here, for an interesting build. I was planning a similar build, you beat me to it. I am planning a build somewhat like this for My PW, will be nice to see what it can accomplish PvP to. I would have taken great str 5 and 6 instead of improved sneak. But that is just my pref. A pity not being able to use the divine shield feat, i agree, but.....<br>That AC you have written, 62, is that without shield? Thats another thing, I would have considered sword and board, but that will yield a reduction in style points.<br><br>Well thank you for this build no matter.<br><br>PS! bulls strength will increase your damage either +1 or +3, not +2, because of your great weapon.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 08/14/05 17:50</span></i></p>

I enjoyed playtesting this build.  There is nothing like sneaking up on your opponents in Full Plate without having to resort to magic, and just unloading massive amounts of damage that they can't recover from.  Imagine giving this little darling a dex boosting item and a few things to enhance Hide/MS skills, and then even characters with a maxed listen skill are not going to detect her.  <br><br>In certain PvP environments she should shine.  True seeing would blow her out of the water, but that goes for all stealth builds.  The Vrock and Doom Knight can buy her some time, or allow her to get in some sneaks and IKDs, while the UMD can make her adaptable to any situation.  He Dev Crit DC is just high enough that you don't want to take the chance getting hit by her.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

That's crap.  I still quit.

Really like this build - totally unique and great fun to RP. Epic Reputation isn't a terrible alternative at lvl 36  - it gives +4 to Taunt. With that, you could drop ESF: Taunt and take Epic Will or ESF: Listen instead.

Epic Reputation in lieu of Improved Sneak I at Blackguard22, but at Blackguard25, Improved Sneak can still be taken.  So in the end, it's a loss of 1 sneak die while a +4 gain to Taunt.  I can live with that.<br><br>Let the games continue then, I'll play for a wee bit longer.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>
