The BATTLE MAGISTRATE (Champion of Tyr) <br>By Deborah Tyr<br><br>It had been centuries since Tyr, the god of war, had led his force of over 200 archons across Valhalla, in an ultimate bid to return Oden to power, and end the onslaught of anarchy and injustice which had brought about conflict and strife among both gods and humans.<br><br>Oden, the god of gods, had in the mind of Valigan, grown soft and useless. Valigan was by all accounts just a foolish upstart, but he was also the deity of anarchy, and had for some time been calling for all out mutiny in Valhalla. In time, he got what he wanted, so far as his call led to an all out war, in Valhalla and on earth. <br><br>Tyr was Oden’s champion, and had vowed not only to put an end to the war, but to also restore Oden’s full glory, in both Valhalla and on earth. In a hard fought battle against the forces of anarchy, Tyr’s army was ultimately successful, and an uneasy peace, among the gods and humans alike eventually ensued. But, like all great victories, it was not without its cost. <br><br>Slain by Tyr’s own hand was Valigan, but it cost Tyr rather dearly; fighting by Valigan’s side had been his faithful Fenir, a blood-thirsty, three-headed dog that, without any hint of fear or hesitation, leaped out at Tyr. Growling, with rage, its teeth fully bared, it snatched away with Tyr’s hand the very instant that Tyr swung the fatal blow that killed its master. Howling in pain, having just lost his hand, Tyr's blade next swung at Fenir, and killed it. Notwithstanding the pain, with Valigan dispatched, Tyr’s victory came to the attention of other gods who, up until then, had either been hedging their bets, or elected to remain neutral in the whole torrid affair. Torm and Ilmater were not among the neutral, but up until then neither had been able to sway their colleagues, other deities, to fully support Oden one way or the other. Tyr’s victory against Valigan soon changed this, such that Torm and Ilmater were now able to join up with Tyr proper, and help lead the charge made up not only of the archons, but of other gods and lesser deities, who finally agreed to aid Oden’s cause. <br><br>With this, and with Torm and Ilmater fighting by his side, Tyr’s army was successful; and all that was good, and fair, and just was inevitably able to prevail. And on that day, perhaps to avoid a repeat of the conflict arising from lawlessness and evil, Tyr gave the whole of Faerun perhaps the greatest gift of all: that of the law codes, to enable human progress, and fair administration of justice. With this, the victorious triad – consisting of Tyr, Torm, and Ilmater, returned to Valhalla, where they were all rewarded by Oden for their loyalty; his power fully restored, he was most thankful, and rewarded especially for this was Tyr.<br><br>For his blind obedience and just retribution against Valigan and the forces of anarchy, Oden bestowed on Tyr the mantle of justice, which he dutifully accepted, in addition to his duties over matters of war. With anarchy now destroyed, a peace ensued among the gods and the humans, too. On earth, it became known as the procession of peace: and many centuries soon came to pass, where all of Faerun was able to flourish and to prosper.  But, like all great victories, they do not last. A great storm was coming, brewing in Valhalla were rumors that other gods and lesser deities were getting ready once again to challenge Oden for the throne of power, and all of Faerun could feel that something terrible was afoot.<br><br>One such place where these rumors were brewing was in a sleepy village by the sea, in a place today known as Ireland. Rumors quickly spread that an evil god, be it Cyric or maybe even Bane, was up to no good, and that Tyr in turn was seeking a champion. Like all good rumors, be they false or be they true, panic ensued, and the village was soon abuzz.<br><br>“Stop this nonsense at once,” demanded a village leader, but it was no use. The village had heard the rumors about an ensuring war among the gods, which as expected led to panic. Then, one day, a miracle happened. In the middle of the village, thrust deep into a boulder, and completely out of thin air, a longsword appeared; also known as the justicar, or the sword of justice, it bore the clear mark of Tyr. <br><br>“The rumours, they be true,” cried an old man. “Tyr *is* seeking a champion!”<br><br>With that, the boldest and strongest men of the village approached the rock, to examine the sword, and were determined each and all to pull it. Be it for reasons of glory, or riches, or other earthly inclinations, each man grasped at the handle, determined to be Tyr’s chosen champion, and expecting that their brute strength alone would succeed in pulling Tyr's sword from the boulder. But try as hard they might, as strong as they were, each man failed in turn to budge the sword. None could pull it from the boulder. <br><br>“We’re doomed!” cried an elderly woman, clutching at the children now gathered around her, as if she could protect them from the coming storm. On hearing this cry, and the incessant and growing buzz from ouside his office window, the Battle Magistrate had no choice but to leave his temple, which also served as a court; he was determined to restore the peace.<br><br>“What is this all about?” asked the Battle Magistrate, who was not only the village protector and healer, but also its law-giver. A follower of Tyr, and a decorated soldier who went onto law school, in those days taught by the temple priests, he had verily studied the code; it was the same code that had been granted so long ago by Tyr. On hearing the rumors, and seeing the sword jutting out from the boulder, the Battle Magistrate understood. Instinctively, he knew what it was that he had to do. As a follower of Tyr, a loyal and faithful priest with nothing but the cause of fairness, justice, and goodness in his heart, the Battle Magistrate approached the rock, and stood beside the sword of Tyr. <br><br>“It’s too deep,” cried one man, who had been among the first to fail to move it.<br><br>“It’s some kind of trick,” cried another, who had likewise been unsuccessful.<br><br>“It’s dark magic, foul it ‘tis,” cried the elderly woman, still clutching at the children. <br><br>“It’s a sign of Tyr,” responded the Battle Magistrate. “So long as Tyr is with us, all that is good, and just, and fair is also with us.” Closing his eyes and feeling for the handle of the blade, and grasping it, gently but firmly, he prayed. <br><br>“By Tyr’s will,” he prayed, his eyes shut tightly, and he pulled upon the blade. Without trouble or resistance, he pulled Tyr's sword from the boulder, as effortlessly as one might slice with a hot blade through butter. The Battle Magistrate, a learned man and village law-giver, being just, and fair in his actions, with no thought of reward, or anything other than the purity of hope and faith in his heart, was able to pull out the sword: Tyr had chosen. <br><br>“It be a miracle,” exclaimed the old woman, releasing the children.<br><br>“We’re saved,” cried another in the village, while guzzling down his beer. <br><br>The panic, in turn, began to dissipate, and the village calm once again; everyone took a deep breath. Come what may, they knew Tyr was with them, for he had chosen his champion; that he had chosen so wisely also meant that justice, as they knew it, as Tyr had decreed it to all of Faerun so long ago, would be delivered against the guilty on behalf of the weak, and the sick, and the innocent. With this, they all exalted relief: for it was also decreed that, so long as Tyr had a champion, all things good, and just, and fair would forever prevail.<br><br>NOTE: The Battle Magistrate is the fourth and final character in law-giver/law enforcer series.

Excellent story, a weird mix of Norse- (though you twist the names and happenings slightly) and Anglomyths with Faerun fantasy.<br><br>25 Cleric-levels and 17 Wisdom????? Raise it to 20, girl. AT LEAST to 19, heck 1 AB and damage is hardly worth dropping spell-levels 8 and 9 for. Why so much cleric without level 8 and 9 spells? Also, Go Cleric 26/Bard2/Fighter12 and take 1 bard level in pre-epic to get an earlier skilldump and BAB 25 to exploit the Divine Power bug I told you about. The problem with it is the xp-penalty. You could drop EWS and go CoT perhaps.<br><br>I suspect we'll see version 2,3,4 and 5 now, since there is a bit to go on here to fulfill a fighter-clerics potential. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">   <br><br>Cool build again Deborah, but the unfulfilled potential of the build is a drag. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">   <br><br>I'm sure you'll find a few similar builds out there too. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">  <br><br>*Edit* You list f.ex. destruction and slay living among your "great" spell arsenal, but even a pure Rogue or mage will save more often than not vs those. Your DC with Slay living is 10(base)+ 3 (Wis) + 5 (spell-level). A DC=18 is hardly gonna kill anyone, except for autofail. It's a Combat-Cleric, save your slots for buffing and healing, and no-save spells(Harm/Ice-storm).<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild.

I am very disappointed!  You proemised a cleric that was great!   THis isnt even adequate.   25 cleri with 17 wisdom!!  YOu list spells as pluses, yet you couldnt use this guy to cast your way out of a cereal box (dc is too low).  You take Quicken spell!   omg.  THis is the most useless feat to take as a cleric!  Why no empower spell?  Oh, thats right, you dont like clerics!   <br><br>One of the things about building quantitiy vs quality is that you forget what makes a decent build.  imho, next time you have an idea for a theme, make sure you understand the classes before you post.  This is a very sad version.   Too bad it isnt Tyr'spaladin...<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Grim, Kail: thanks, guys <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      On this one, and curiously, there's no other combo out there (ie., bard, cleric, ftr), none; and yet, without wm or rdd (which kinda inspired me on this one <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">       we gets us a smilar AB result as we would, but using ftr, with a ton more feats. for a build using so much cleric, to get ab 41 isn't bad at all (but yeah, cost: higher spells, but with all the extra feats and so forth, you guys make a great point on that, as while we got us a nice combat cleric, why not go for it all, exploit all the potential that's here for a power-type battle cleric, indeed! (good thinking, and thanks! will look into it and PM the changes!).<br><br>Grim, glad you like it, and the story, too; hope I didn't butcher Norse culture too badly (we all know, or should know, that Tyr, god of war and law/order, lost his hand to leash Fenir of course; and the rebellion incident, that's where Odin's hammer, symbolizing his power, had to be returned; ah, great culture, indeed!

I'll echo the others on raising that wisdom to at least 19.  I would also shift to Cleric 26/Fighter 12/Harper Scout 2. Drop quicken for alertness, you have iron will in there already.  You gain an epic feat from the bard list, though you lose UMD, and you can raise your skills twice with no XP penalty.  Also go for a 15 BAB pre-epic, the max AB attack from divine power more than makes up for it.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

OK - a compromise is in order here it seems; 9th level spells you say? alrighty then - just ask, and I aim to please <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">       At level 21 and again at level 24, instead of great strength, take great wisdom (ie., final stats, strength 30 &amp; wis 19): this will net you not only your 8th and 9th level spells (5 each level in fact), but also enable you to cast those awesome 7th level ones (ie, Tyr's gift, as soon as ya hits epic <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">        <br><br>So we lose one natural AB (as in, unbuffed AB +40, but that's a fair trade, totally, since nothing, not even a holy sword, can take that from us, thus making us combat safe so to speak. Thus, giving us balance b/w cleric (Level 9 casting) and combat (AB +40, with 1 less natural damage; but hey, so what really, this guy has the str to dish -- now bring on those buffs!) ... also,  we gets to keep the bard here -- oh, that bard (er, flavor/UMD (and you know how I feel about BARD TOYS! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    <br><br>And really, thank you, Avado for (add to edit ie turnin' me on...TO CLERICS <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">        <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    (too funny <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      But Mith's suggestion is a great one (as usual, and thanks!); let's see what it looks like, bring on the Harper instead, go for more cleric power, while retaining fighter - sounds great. (yeah, yeah: I'll build ya a casting-cleric, Avado: don't you worry - in the meantime, what we gots here is a cool &amp; improved combat-cleric-combo, a super nice balance b/w combat &amp; casting, w. UMD versatility, &amp; not entirely dependent thus on buffs all the time.<br><br>Anyway, particularly useful should you find yerself on one of those PWs where buffs in general, and not only cleric, are being severely curtailed these days; anywho, and overall, a nice compromise me thinks: 9th level spells, earlier spell access, and still w. decent HPs, nice combat prowess, damage, etc. (thanks, everyone!). <br><br>In the meantime, stay tuned: have I got a cleric for you a coming, and how ~ Tyr (as always, great suggestions <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 08/02/06 03:25</span></i></p>

This is odd. Well, I'll wait to see it with 19 WIS.<br><br>Anyway, pure Cleric pre-epic can be a great advantage to take Divine Power's Exploit and cap your AB. BTW, since you like so much spell descriptions that you even linked to Wikipedia, read yourself Cleric spell level 9: Undeath's Eternal Foe, and you'll see how <b>much</b> you were missing with a single buff by not taking level 9 spells, besides all level 8 spells, you will also have a nice amount of level 8 and 9 slots that need to be used.<br><br>Summon VII is crap <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  seriously. Even Summon IX should be weak, the only summon I consider non-crappy is Elemental Swarm, since its defensive capability is huge, but you can't get it anyway, I'm ranting again.<br><br>As avado said, Quicken Spell is useless, you might want to take Great Fortitude <i>and</i> Iron Will. I'd suggest to change Domains to Trickery and Travel, to gain Improved Invisibility and Haste, which are most valuable buffs.

Thanks, Thax. Yeah, some of those spells, eternal foe, AWESOME, indeed (ok, as a pally fan, what have I been missing? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    ). On this one, really wanting some natural combat stats, but seriously great points are made here re: level 8 and 9 spells, so, rebuilt our combat fellow such that, not only does he have full spell access now, but also even *better* unbuffed combat stats (with much better unbuffed saves, and also his combat damage, as a ftr, fully intact <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">    (thanks out to, Grim's COT idea for that! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>GOING TO REPOST as such, incorporating a lot of the great ideas in here, using for eg the COT instead of bard on the revised version (note: don't ya worry Mith, I've another cleric, a caster, spell DC 20+ and even better spell access, full DP exploit (among other neat twix): what's that, you ask?
