Hola, I'm looking for a dex build with a high ab and ac.  No dev crit.  Playing with +15 weapons and armor, I hope to get over 80 ab, and hopefully over 90 ac.. i've been looking on forums, but unfortunately there's no search tool on guild forums.

If it's true you don't need them, you can replace them by some other feats you like. Something for initiative would be good I think.

Tumble roll is modified by dex so you actually need less than that, but since it gives 1ac every 5 ranks(not skill) then its useful , as for mobility and spring attack , imo they dont add much to the build. <br><br>Syrath

Is Wizard the better class to use to bridge Fighter to Arcane Archer? Wouldn't two levels of Bard be of more use to this character? Taking the second level of Bard at the end of this character's career would grant Tumble and Use Magic Device.<br><br>Why did you choose wizard for this build?<br><br>If anyone else wants to jump in with their thoughts go ahead.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban.

The main reason for going wizard is that Elves get wizard as a favoured class, so taking fighter 9 wizard 1 won't have an xp penalty, whereas fighter 9 Bard 1 will. <br><br>That said, I've got a build that keeps fighter and bard levels close to avoid the xp penalty, and it's pretty good. Not only do you get tumble and UMD, you also get Bardsong, which is nice.<br><br><a href="http://www.intactic.com/zyn/nwn_builds/FighterBardAA.htm" target="_blank">Click Here</a>
