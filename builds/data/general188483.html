Hi sorry never made a Monk before so no laughing please !.<br><br>When a Monk is fighting with fists only do you ever get to attack with both hands. I.E do you need to Take Ambi / 2 weapon fighting to enable it. <br><br>Or is it presumed your always fighting 2 handed hence the extra Attack ?

Im not sure which, but the upshot is you dont need the dual wield feats for fighting with hands. Fists are never considered dual wield for number of attacks, or it is assumed you are using both.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

I have another question on monks.<br><br>If you are building a Dex based monk does weapon finesse work with unarmed strike?<br><br>I honestly do not know and do not have a comp with the game on it near me or would test this myself.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Pendragon<br><br>Edit: Found my answer with some additional searching of builds. I will be using weapon finesse on the build.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Pendragon2u on 04/06/05 19:12</span></i></p>

One warning on Wep Finesse.  If you are using the PRC, the Wep Finesse feat does not work properly with using fists.  I can't thoroughly explain what is happening, I just know that it does not calculate it correctly into your ab with fists.  This is only with the PRC.  If you don't use it, then no worries.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.
