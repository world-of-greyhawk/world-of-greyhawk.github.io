The basic idea behind this build was to create another strong Ranger for melee, with reasonable prowess as well as having a few tricks up the sleave.  A solid AB, HP, AC and saves were the primary goal.  I wanted to get a first strike sort of thing, which is the reason for all of the initiative.  A solid combat presence combined with a decent strategist.<br><br><b>Name: </b>Forest Shadow<br><b>Classes: </b>Ranger 23, Champion of Torm 10, Shadowdancer 7<br><b>Playable 1-40, PvM</b><br><b>Race: </b>Human<br><b>Alignment: </b>any non-evil<br><br><b>Starting Stats: </b><br><br>Str 14 to 26<br>Dex 14<br>Con 14 to 16<br>Wis 14<br>Int 14<br>Cha 8<br><br><br><b>Leveling: </b><br><br>1 Ranger1 - Dodge, WF: Scimitar, FE: Human<br>2 Ranger2<br>3 Ranger3 - Mobility<br>4 Ranger4<br>5 Ranger5 - FE: Undead<br>6 Ranger6 - Knockdown<br>7 Ranger7<br>8 Shadowdancer1<br>9 Champion of Torm1 - Blind Fight<br>10 Champion of Torm2 - Improved Knockdown<br>11 Ranger8<br>12 Shadowdancer2 - Improved Initiative<br>13 Champion of Torm3<br>14 Champion of Torm4 - Improved Critical: Scimitar<br>15 Ranger9 - Toughness<br>16 Champion of Torm5<br>17 Shadowdancer3<br>18 Ranger10 - FE: Elementals, Lightning Reflexes<br>19 Ranger11<br>20 Ranger12<br><br>21 Champion of Torm6 - Epic Skill Focus: Move Silently, Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>22 Shadowdancer4<br>23 Ranger13<br>24 Champion of Torm7 - Great Strength I<br>25 Champion of Torm8 - Epic Prowess<br>26 Ranger14<br>27 Shadowdancer5 - Great Strength II<br>28 Ranger15 - FE: Construct<br>29 Ranger16<br>30 Ranger17 - Superior Initiative<br>31 Champion of Torm9<br>32 Shadowdancer6<br>33 Ranger18 - Great Constitution I<br>34 Champion of Torm10 - Armor Skin<br>35 Ranger19<br>36 Ranger20 - Great Constitution II, FE: Dragon<br>37 Shadowdancer7<br>38 Ranger21<br>39 Ranger22 - Epic Will<br>40 Ranger23 - Bane of Enemies<br><br><br><b>Skills: </b><br><br>Hide 43[45]<br>Move Silently 43[55]<br>Discipline 43[51]<br>Tumble 40[42]<br>Set Traps 19[21, 23 with synergy bonus]<br>Animal Empathy 21<br>Spot 43[45]  - should see most things coming<br>Search 20[22]  - can detect all deadly traps<br>Disable Trap 1[3, 5 with synergy bonus] (2cc)<br>Spellcraft 8[10] (16cc)<br><br><br><b>Spells: </b><br><br>1: Camo, Resist Elem, Ultravis<br>2: Cat's Grace, One with Land, Protect from Elem<br>3: Aid, GMF, Invis Purge<br>4: Mass Camo, Freedom of Movement, Polymorph Self<br><br><br><b>HP: </b>546 max<br><br><br><b>AC: </b>22 naked (29-30 buffed with Large Shield and Chainshirt)<br><br><br><b>AB: </b>41/etc.<br><br><br><b>Saves: </b><br><br>Fort: 31[33]<br>Reflex: 30[32]<br>Will: 27[29]<br><br><br><b>Pros: </b><br><br>Good saves backed up with Slippery Mind, Evasion, Defensive Roll, Uncanny Dodge 2 (+1 vs traps)<br>Good HP<br>Decent AB<br>Decent AC<br>Ranger spells to buff animal and yourself<br>Stealth option, even with armour and shield (-6 to skills, -4 in chainshirt only)<br>Three different servants: Summon Shadow, Animal Companion, Dominated Animal<br>Trap Setting and recovery<br>General usefullness of healing and lore<br>First Strength-based meleer to strike with +12 to initiative<br>IKD sits you down to shut you up<br>HiPS for quick retreat and strategic movement<br>Darkvision, Shadow Daze, Shadow Evade, Trackless Step, free ITWF, FE's culminating with BoE<br>Not feat nor skill starved!<br><br><br>Basic strategy includes buffing animal companion, maybe shadow as well, and preparing traps ahead of time.

I would prefer to delay the last CoT level in order to pickup Bane of Enemies earlier.<br><br>33 Ranger18 - Epic Toughness I<br>34 Ranger19<br>35 Ranger20 - FE: Dragon<br>36 Ranger21 - Bane of Enemies<br>37 Shadowdancer7<br>38 Champion of Torm10 - Armor Skin<br>39 Ranger22 - Epic Will<br>40 Ranger23 - Epic Toughness II<br><br>Also, by switching the Great CON feats to Epic Toughness, you would keep the same HP and lose only +1 Fort, but since that save is already high enough it won't affect the build a lot.

This is a good way to approach the Ranger class.  My only suggestions would be to find a way to get more FEs and Bane earlier.  3 more Ranger levels would get you 2 more FEs and a stronger pet.  Not sure what you would have to sacrifice though.<br><br>As it stands now, the only immediate change would be to postpone CoT5 until level 20 (since CoT5 is a "dead level" under its current condition, Divine Wrath won't be of much benefit).  This will allow you to accelerate your Ranger levels to gain quicker access to spells and your 3rd FE.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

To Saosin,<br><br>thanks.  I like that leveling, but i do prefer the Great Cons over the Epic Toughnesses.  While not critical, as you mentioned.  Getting BoE earlier would be much better though.  It wasn't one of my goals when building though.  I think that anything which nets me BoE earlier, in retrospect, is good.  Thanks.<br><br>To Grizz,<br><br>As I mentioned, I wasn't focusing on getting BoE, nor FE's, too early.  I think that damage is alright by itself, but the boost is what makes Ranger so worthwhile.  My main aim was, which i really should have mentioned but didn't because I am silly, is that I wanted to get the saving throw bonus feats from SD, the good saves from CoT, while having the Ranger as the primary class for the build.  I did alright, but the BoE thing still kinda bugs me.<br><br>I think you are right.  Pushing CoT5 to the end of pre-epic is a good move.  Those Ranger levels just don't come in fast enough with those CoT levels in the way, but I needed them to be able to grab the initiative feats without sacrificing combat ability (which i already did to some extent by leaving out expertise, disarm and called shot).<br><br>btw, grizz, i am trying out the Journeyman Grim in HotU, with a small change - taking assassin levels one higher then listed to boost UMD more effectively.  Pretty tough char.  thanks.<br><br><br>This build, sadly, can't get much better, but its not too bad to being with.  Unless someone comes up with a really inspired idea to help this char, which I would be glad to hear.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>“If you bring a Ranger with you, it is well to pay attention to him...”

I would give serious thought to dropping any SD until 22nd level - taking Ranger 16, then CoT 5 (this maximises your save potential by that point). Your BAB can reach 30 by doing this. You sacrifice your HIPS and Tumble until then, but lets be honest you can level to 22 fairly quickly all the same.<br><br>If you did leave it until epic, then both Dodge and Mobility can be taken later in the pre-epic stages, letting you take, KD, IKD, Toughness, Imp Crit, Imp Init earlier in the build. <br><br>I tried to understand how you got your skillspread on a base of INT 14. From that you only get 295 skillpoints:<br><br>Skill Ranks (Used)<br>Hide 43 (43)	<br>MS 43 (43)	<br>Disc 43 (43)	<br>Tble 40 (45)	<br>Spot 43 (43)	<br>Srch 20 (20)	<br>Lore 18 (18)	<br>Heal 18 (18)	<br>D.Trap 1 (2)	<br>A.Emp 23 (23)	<br>S.Trap 21 (21)	<br>Spell 8 (16)<br><br>Total 329 (335)	<br><br>Whilst on skills, perhaps of note is the synergy in Set and Disable Traps of a +2 bonus when you have 5 ranks in each.<br><br>How much do you really want SD 7? Is it just for Slippery Mind? Not sure how much safer I would feel being able to reroll my Will save. <br><br>I would consider taking Ranger 25 and SD 5 instead... as your FE bonus would raise by 1 point, you would gain an Epic Ranger Feat, allowing you take Epic Prowess there, and in turn freeing an epic CoT feat for Superior Initiative. This would give you an extra feat in epic that could be taken (perhaps ESF: Hide, Epic Fort or Reflex).<br><br>Again, perhaps Luck of Heros at 1st and dropping Lightning Reflex altogether (gain +1 to Fort, Will and Reflex instead of +2 Reflex only)<br><br>Just some thoughts for you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
