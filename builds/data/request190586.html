Okay i got some new things for this build.<br><br>Race: Dwarf.<br><br>classes: at least 20 lvls of fighter and that is from lvl 1-20. <br><br>Dwarven axe, battle axe or bastard sword as weapon.<br><br>Now I need something to compliment the AT LEAST 20 lvls of FTR. On the server you get epic warding as lvl 20 FTR, so that is VERY preferable.

I can certainly see why you'd want 20 levels of fighter for <i>that</i>.  Well, Weapon Master is one idea.  Something like Fighter(20)/Weapon Master(19)/Rogue(1).  Take the rogue level near the end to get maxed UMD and Tumble.  You'll get some nice extra AB from the weapon master levels, as well as improved crit range and access to Ki Damage.  You could also do Fighter(22)/Weapon Master(16)/Rogue(2).  Since I assume you're taking the first 20 levels straight fighter, that will let you pick up epic weapon focus/specialization on your first 2 epic levels, and 2 levels of rogue gives you evasion, as well as letting you max UMD and tumble once earlier on and then again at the end, so you'll have access to some of the higher AC and UMD ability throughout more of the build.  In exchange, you only get +3 extra AB from your WM levels instead of +4.<br><br>Steve

I have to take 3 lvls in each class as well. I don't know if a FTR gains more after 20 FTR but i hardly think it does. Should i aim for WM after that?

Normally, I wouldn't even take 20 fighter levels except for the Epic Warding thing on your PW.  You definitely don't need more than that if there aren't any further benefits.  You'll want at least 1 epic fighter level to get epic weapon spec (maybe only take 19 levels of fighter pre-epic, and then take the last one at level 21 to pick up Epic Weapon Focus and Epic Weapon Spec at once).<br><br>If you need 3 levels of any class you multiclass in...well, when do you need to have those by?  Just by the end of the build, or is there some earlier point you need it by?  You can always drop the rogue for straight fighter/WM, or bump the rogue up to 3.  That would net you a 2d6 sneak and Uncanny Dodge I, which would actually be very useful since the UMD would give you access to monk equipment that might give you nice dodge bonuses to AC.  Uncanny Dodge I would mean you'd keep these dodge bonuses to AC even if caught flatfooted (basically, you can't get caught flatfooted).<br><br>Steve

I'm aiming for 24ftr/13WM/3rogue. I cannot level up with 1 lvl rogue and then switch back to FTR or WM. so the lvl is something like this:<br><br>22FTR<br>7WM<br>24FTR<br>12WM<br>3rogue<br>1WM
