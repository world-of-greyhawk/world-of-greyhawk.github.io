Gram had finally arrived at the gates of Skuld. He was hungry and parched, after crossing the great dust desert, Raurin for almost a week, after an archeological expedition was cancelled due to "technical difficulties"; he had been informed that a certain ruin contained scriptures and housed artifacts that would utterly prove the existence of the Overgod Ao, only to find that the so called ruin was a nest of a great blue dragon. Gram now knows better than to believe in tavern talk.<br><br>Walking in a seeming daze, he trips on a small protruding rock and stumbles on a group of mulhorandi slavers, much to his luck.<br><br>"Well, what do we have here? Another troublemaker perhaps?" said one of the slavers, a mulhorandi adorned with golden jewelries.<br><br>"Looks like this one could fetch a good price in the market, don't you think so boss? Hahahaha!" said the other, a big brute of a man that seemed to be the muscle of the group.<br><br>As this big brute bent down to grab Gram by his torn, sand blasted coat, a massive green fist suddenly knocks the slaver to the wall. More huge green hands suddenly appear, grabbing and squeezing the other slavers. One slaver attempts to charge at Gram, but a big interposing hand simply blocks his attacks. Onlookers gather around, and as they close up, they simply find themselves laughing at the plight of the slavers.<br><br>Another big green hand helps Gram up and helps him remove the dust from his coat. It then grabs some apples from a nearby store, tosses some coins to the shopkeeper, and gives the apple to Gram. He eats heartily, and the people laugh out even more as the slavers try in vain to squirm their way out of the tight grip of the crushing hands. <br><br>Finished eating, Gram turns his attention to the slavers who tried to take him as a slave. A blinding flash of light burst from his hand, revealing a big bastard sword that seemed too heavy for Gram to lift, but he waves it with great ease. He points the sharp end of the gleaming blade at the jewel-laden slaver, who seemed to be the head of the group. <br><br>"How much do you think YOU would sell for in the market, hmm?"<br><br>* - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - *<br><br>The blade seer is a spell-casting heavy "spellsword?" (I don't really know if you'd call this a spellsword <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   ) Incredible amount of feats, skills, melee potential and casting as a level 37 wizard, the blade seer is definitely a fun character to play since he can perform a great variety of activities, be it melee combat, spell slinging, or perhaps mercantile business.

Damage can also be modified through Flame Weapon and most other Weapon modifying skills. Bastard sword (or maybe Katana) is used because it has the highest damage of medium weapons. Going two-handed won't really mean much since you don't have that much STR to be multiplied for the damage. I'd rather have a tower shield, which also helps in defense during spellcasting, which compound with Improved Expertise to give you a considerable amount of AC when casting.<br><br>Comments and suggestions please. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br><br><i>Touched up format - Kail Pendragon</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/16/07 08:22</span></i></p>

Your melee simply sucks (True Strike? Please, it's a 9 seconds spell!), I see no purpouse in the weapon feats. I'd drop them and get a second focused school and craft wand preepic and ESF in the secondary school in Epic.<br><br>If playing where Expertise/Imp.Exp. exploiting is not allowed one might well consider to drop those feats and CC/ICC too since at that point defensive casting comes for free. <br><br>Spellcraft and UMD work in multiples of 5, you should adjust them accordingly. Well, you could leave Spellcraft as it is, since it will be 60 when you cap INT.<br><br>Hellball is really no big deal (especially at once per day). I'd be inclined to drop it for on emore Great INT so that you can start at 17 INT (starting a stat at 18 is really expensive) and put those points elsewhere (into CON you can pump it to 16 if you lower STR to 13).

Other than the (useless) combat feats, this seems like a pretty standard Wizard Ftr X (tumble class) build to me.  If you had a LOT of really, REALLY low AC mobs, this might be worth it, but if not, go 38 Wiz 1 Ftr 1 Bard, and just be the standard casting Wizard.

This is definitely <i>not</i> a fighter build.<br>It has 37 lvl of wizard and has enough emphasis on the casting part to get that job done.<br>The build has 3 attacks per round and better AB than a dedicated caster. The capped AB with equipment is 52, and you can add the effect of taunt to that. It shouldn't be too difficult to get the AB up near 40 in most settings.  So the build will be able to use the sword in some situations. <br>I agree that longsword is a better choice if you plan on casting Tensers (unless it is modified where you play).<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 10/16/07 06:22 (GMT) -- Kjeldor Alduel<br>... clumsy + witty + handsome = girls <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif">     <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    <br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->I thought the character <i>was</i> a girl  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...
