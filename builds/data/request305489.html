Ok so i play on the Heart of winter server, im looking to build a new build, ive experminted on the server with builds and no matter what i build i get pwned. I was thinking of a few builds, one that can hit the max you can and dev crits alot, or a sneaky build that can sneak around. The third build i was thinking about was a build that is really hard to hit.<br><br>Some info about the server<br><br>they took out hips,<br>They weapons only go to 2d6<br>you can put +8 on items for str,dex,int,con,wis,cha.
