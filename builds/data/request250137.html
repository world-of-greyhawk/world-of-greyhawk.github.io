Hey its me again..<br><br>At work and bored so thought up a build. Its something like 21 bard/5 pally(blackguard)/14 fighter.<br>Basically he will have 20 cha/high strength and divine might/shield.<br><br>Now I decided to not wear a shield (dont ask why), but cannot really decide if i would want a large weapon or dual wield. A couple questions i have:<br>1. Will both weapons be affected by divine might and bard song?<br>2. What does dual wielding exactly give me? An extra attack? Two? Cool looks? It seems like a heavy investment: 3 feats/15 dex.<br><br>That is it for now, will be back though to pester all you gurus out there...<br>_________________<br>Everything`s been done, everything`s been said so why bother

Looks cool, yes.<br><br>Feat investment is steep, as is the ability score requirement. Also, your mainhand weapon will get your ful STR bonus to damage, while the offhand weapon gets only 1/2 your STR bonus to damage. A two-hander will get 1.5x your STR bonus to damage.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;That is it for now, will be back though to pester all you gurus out there...</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>Hope that helps.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
