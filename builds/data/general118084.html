Hi All,<br><br>      I'm not much of an uber builder but would like to help this community / guild as I can. I was thinking that one way I could help is by possibly hosting some of the character build bic files on my web page for download. I have a free 5mb web page from my isp and would dedicate it to the builds from this guild if you would like. This way if there are some particularly awesome or favorite builds of everyone then they would be available for download to everyone in the guild. I'd host as many as the 5mb would allow. Please let me know what you think of this idea.<br><br><br>                                     Thanks, Mano

Hi ManoWarr <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>That sounds like a great idea! could we post links directly to the build descriptions? that would be cool, how big is a .bic file anyway?<br>_________________<br>One must still have chaos in one to give birth to a dancing star! <br>~Friedrich Nietzsche

I think the more equipt your character has increases the bic file size. Almost all my builds that are built and without equipt except for the basics seem to be around 25kb to 140kb. My webpage has a limit of 5mb so that would probably hold quite a bunch of bics. I'd imagine once I uploaded the builds' bic file you could definitely post a link to download it on the description page. The main part of the link would stay the same for example would be<br><a href="http://home.sc.rr.com/nwnpcbuilds/thundarr3.bic" target="_blank">http://home.sc.rr.com/nwnpcbuilds/thundarr3.bic</a><br>that is an example. I placed a character I made on the site to test. Thundarr is a 40 level barbarian/ftr/wm with thundering rage and I believe terifying rage as well as dev crit and a bunch of other goodies. If the link works right you'd just click on it and then save/ download the bic. Then just put the bic in your local vault and you'd have the character. I keep up to date antivirus, but as with any file make sure to scan it with your antivirus as well. I doubt anything like a virus could even be put in a bic, but always be safe than sorry.<br><br>                                    Thanks, Mano<br><br>I tested it and the link works great!! Once I received a bic of a build and uploaded it to my site all anyone would have to do is post the above link in their description page. They would just need to change the thundarr3.bic to whatever the name of their bic that I uploaded was. Let's use a made up name say the bic name is Puffv3.0.bic. Then you'd post the link changing the thundarr3.bic with Puffv3.0.bic. Then anyone in the group could download that build and not need to go through all the building proccess.If anyone likes this idea and wants me to host their bic file please let me know and then you could email me the file and I'd upload it.<br><br>                                       Thanks again, Mano<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ManOWarr on 03/27/04 04:30</span></i></p>

hmmmm...when I click on it all I get are soem Chinese characters, but I'm  sure someone will know how to make it work <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Imagine if we, as a guild, made an arrangement with one of the PW servers like the one cdualepp has, where we could make a new lvl 40 C bring him/her IG to show off the build, chat, or just gather for some hardcore PvP <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

hmm,<br><br>     well maybe your internet explorer setting doesn't allow direct link or something. You can try copying the link into your explorer address bar and then clicking enter. I'm not sure, when I click the link the save file comes up and I've downloaded it three times testing it.Anyone else maybe could try it and see what happens for them. I'm sorry for the trouble!<br><br>               thanks, Mano

By the way, have you considered about having your own server? I mean something like self-host. You host your own site and you can use a crappy computer or whatever and you practically can have big space, such as one gig(hard-drive space), or more than that. With that amount, you could host unlimited amount of builds on that server. Although doing that way, it would require more work in order to get it to work, IE; buying your own domain, downloading something that enables you to host your own site (mainly through another site such as self-host.com I think), and editing your website (you can use html editor, I particually like CuteHTML because it automatically makes the html coding(&lt;HTML&gt;, &lt;BODY&gt;, &lt;FONT&gt; to &lt;/FONT&gt; and they can convert all colors that you have into hex code. Plus, the editor is free to download!).<br><br>Also, as I stated before, you can buy crappy computer. Just buy used one that has bare minimum stuff on it. You only need certain things to make self-hosted site on it. Modem(cable, DSL, etc), Hard-drive, good videocard if you plan to have pictures of every builds on it, RAMs, and couple other things for it. They don't have to be up-to-the-date version, just use ones that can do what is required of it. You can get them cheap at ebay.com. As for one gig hard-drive, they are real cheap now.<br><br>Anyway, just offering my wisdom on this... not sure if it would be useful... lol.<br><br>Anuis<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Anuis on 03/30/04 03:03</span></i></p>

Hi all, <br><br>        I saw a thread asking for help in building a Bruce Lee character and I made one and posted it on that thread for download. Here's my original post:<br><br>Hi all,<br><br>After reading this thread it made me want to build him. I built him quickly as I could so the build may need tweaking if your a total power gamer. Anyway I uploaded the bic file to my website so if any of you want you can download it. I ended up 34 monk and 6 ftr. the final stats were str 14,dex 22,con 14,int 13,wis 16, cha 10. Again I was trying for overall balanced build not min maxing. He mainly focussed in unarmed attacks, but has all the two weapon feats and weapon focus kama. He has epic spell resist 2, and toughness. Also weap finesse, dodge, and mobility. I'll do a more thorough write up later. anyway give it a look see and please post any tweaks suggestions.Also I forgot to add he has quite a bit of custom ninja/monk gear I made. Here's the link: <a href="http://home.sc.rr.com/nwnpcbuilds/brucelee3.bic" target="_blank">http://home.sc.rr.com/nwnpcbuilds/brucelee3.bic</a><br>All you have to do is click on link and save file in your localvault for NWN and the character will be there for you to try. I keep up to date anti-virus but as with anything I'd advise you scan the file with your anti virus just as a precaution. <br><br>Thanks, Mano

Also on the above build if any of you could maybe come up with a better level up plan for him I'd love to see it. I probably should have went with more of the fighter levels pre epic but oh well.<br><br>                       Thanks, Mano

Wow!! Unlimited webspace!! Well in reality though bic files don't take up much space. I think it's Awesome of you to offer this though. I'm not very experienced in the whole webspace thing, but I'm sure somebody in this guild would have some ideas. I'd be more than happy to share any builds characters I have for download to your webspace if it's used.<br><br>           <br>                            Thanks, Mano<br>_________________<br>A Man of War who treads the world's roads alone, as I do, must be quick.

Hey no problem, Id love to help out. Just kinda curious of what people would like to see up on the site. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif"> <br><br>I have an unlimited mailbox too so send .bic files to <a href="mailto:matt@intelimaxx.net">matt@intelimaxx.net</a> plus try to write a brief description of the character along with it. I can fire up the toolset and take screenshots of the charatcters to add also. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrinno.gif"> <br><br>I would also like to add build tips, so send me any tips or tricks, or walkthroughs to that address also. <br><br>Fire any more ideas my way. I mailed bioware asking if it would be alright to use images from their site to use, considering it is a community project that is non profit. I think they shouldnt have a problem, but you never know. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif"> <br><br>Hrmmm maybe we need a website thread....<br>_________________<br>It's not a bad partnership.
