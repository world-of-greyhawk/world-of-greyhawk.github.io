The Axeman (or woman) is my attempt at creating the most versatile character, a true "hack" of all trades if you will. Combines rogue skills, arcane spellcasting, and near fighter BAB, making it the ultimate support character.<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Chaotic anything<br>Stats (ending stats in brackets)<br><br>Str 14<br>Dex 16 (26)<br>Con 12<br>Int 16 (20)<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 8<br><br>Levelling<br><br>1.

You can go with short sword, rapier, or even kukri (exotic weapon prof is a an UR bonus feat).<br><br>The build is more magic focused. To get a more melee focus build, you can drop the spell penetration feats, as well as ESF spellcraft in favor of improved sneak attack or other combat feats. You can also take UR up to level 17 to get both HiPS and uncanny dodge.<br><br>Please feel free to comment.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mr_Raider on 04/11/05 22:34</span></i></p>

I like this...a very interesting way to meet the prereqs for Arcane Trickster without using rogue, and a decent balance between magic and melee with nice sneak damage to boot.  Hopefully with enough spellcraft/INT boosting items you might be able to learn the epic spell Unseen Wanderer, since you only have to actually cast it once.  Being able to turn completely invisible at will would beat HiPS hands down anyway.  Very nice <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> .<br><br>Steve
