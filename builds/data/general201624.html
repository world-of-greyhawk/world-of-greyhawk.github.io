Hey.<br>I have several questions about the exalted sorc posted in the bioware's epic character builds page.<br><br>1) If she enters Improved Expertise mode, any spell then she makes disables that mode, isn't it true?<br>2) If I wish to remove Improved Expertise and change it to something else, can I lower the INT to 10? Or 12?<br>3) If we're talking about stats here, why: 12 DEX &amp; STR?<br>Dex for AC and STR to help her carry stuff? Please explain to me <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Thank you kindly in advance,<br>Oz aka XerionX.

You could drop part of multiple skills, but you honestly want to max those 4 at the least, so dropping it to 10 would be bad.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;3) If we're talking about stats here, why: 12 DEX &amp; STR?<br>Dex for AC and STR to help her carry stuff?

And 12 STR allows you to carry that full plate and shield more easily.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 06/28/05 01:20</span></i></p>

Being a sorcerer class character, it does not have access to all 2nd level spells, e.g. not cat's grace, thus 12 DEX. However, if you can obtain equipment that gives you this +4 DEX bonus in total or canget it from other sources (read: scrolls, potions, charged items), then dropping DEX to 8 is an option and dropping STR should also be possible withot troubles.<br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while
