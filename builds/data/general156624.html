It's a Bard 15/Cleric 15/RDD 10, so it's gets a nice high Str as well as Cleric buffs, Bard Song, and Divine Might.  Not the most damaging build out there, but it does well against crit immune types.  <br><br>If you want something that does a lot of damage against creatures that are NOT crit immune, then you are almost certainly looking for a Rogue build.  A Monk 1/Rogue 39 can dish out INSANE damage with sneak attacks, although if you dual-wield kamas and use Flurry of Blows your AB won't be all that high.  Monk 1/Fighter 6/Rogue 33 is possible as well, or Monk 6/Cleric 15/Rogue 19 works too.  The Cleric version does comparable damage when fully buffed, but when unbuffed your damage will be significantly lower.  <br><br>You could also check out Mithdradates Harbinger of Chaos build.  It's a Rogue 17/Fighter 8/Cleric 15.  It gets 8th lvl Cleric spells, Epic Weapon Spec, and 10d6 sneak attacks.  It's a Str-based build, so it can dish out some fairly serious damage in melee as well.  <br><br>If you don't like relying on crits, greatsword will probably be your weapon of choice.  Greataxe is possible as well, but I think greatswords tend to have a consistently higher damage output, if only by a little.

high cha 15 pal/25 cot can deal a realy large amount of divine damage with his holy sword and divine damege. ok some build can cause more with criticals or sneak attacks, but this guys damage is nigh unstopable, becuse its nature.

I really, REALLY like the idea of having a Monk level or two to add to my rogue levels -- the thought of having a LOT of sneak attacks (via flurry of blows) is really, REALLY enticing.<br><br>Trouble is, I am trying to decide between Fighter (or possibly Blackguard?) to add a few levels to help BAB .. or to add a level of SD for that wonderful HIPS ability.  Which is really nice for those flurries o' sneak attacks.<br><br>Anyone have some ideas about these builds?  I thought about a Rogue 38/Monk 1/SD 1 using dual kamas.  But wanted to get some input from the more experienced players on here.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Joe C.

The 7th Monk level is for a late Discipline check.  Although you BAB isn't that high, you can use your Cleric spells to buff it up to the +20 cap, and with Divine Power you get another attack per round at your highest AB.  The other nice thing about Cleric is that it gives you fun spells that allow you to get sneak attacks without using stealth, like Darkness and Improved Invisibility (Trickery domain).  Also allows you to heal yourself, and being able to do 1000+ damage with Harm is always nice.  <br><br>Alternatively, you could do Fighter, or even WM, although personally I feel that WM takes too many feats to be worth it.  Shadowdancer could be useful for the HIPS ability, but it seems like a lot of players (and some creatures) have access to True Seeing, which makes HIPS somewhat less useful than it could be.  <br><br>One thing I would take into consideration when making your build is how much damage you will be able to do vs. crit immune enemies.  That Monk 1/Rogue 38/SD 1 might do crazy damage vs. most enemies, but when you're going up against golems or undead you may find yourself having trouble.  If you take Fighter levels you can get Epic Weapon Spec, which will give you a nice +6 to damage on all attacks, although I'm not sure whether or not this damage is multiplied in the case of a critical.

As usual, thanks for the great info, CC!<br><br>Yeah I tested a couple of those 38/1/1 R/M/SD builds and while they do INCREDIBLE sneak attack damage, when/if you don't off a baddie in that first round o' sneaks .. the toon is in big, bad trouble himself.<br><br>Also decided against the Blackguard.  Yeah, it's nice for the extra sneak attacks and some semi-useful companions (especially for a rogue type), but Fighter (with it's extra combat feats) seems to be the best way to go for this char.<br><br>Now .. the question is how many F levels?  I want to maximize my roguery-type skills (especially sneak attack), so right now am only going to take 4 or possibly 5 (with the 5th one taken either at lvl 21 or at the 40) Fighter levels.<br><br>Would it really be beneficial to take more than that, or do you think it's a better build without say 4 or 5 MORE Fighter levels?<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Joe C.
