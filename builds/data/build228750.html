I'd go with much more Bard preepic to get LI earlier in epic, get WF, EWF,  empower spell  and IC/blind fight/EP/AS by dropping extra music (not that useful even early on if you go with more bard lvls preepic and useless with 20 bard lvls and LI), stil spell and autostill spell I/II. You have got your cleric spells  to be cast in armor, for bards spells buff up without armor just before the fight and then put armor on (luckily in NWN you don't need 30 min like in RL to don a suit of full plate armor). Taking less cleric preepic I'd pump CHA first not to hinder bard and to increase divine might/shield uses/day and power.<br><br>Also, taunt 7?

That's a good choise too. This build is imo very configurable and flexible, quite easy to switch the domains or a few feats to tailor it for the environment it will be used in.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By The Sneaky Sneaker on 01/30/06 13:17</span></i></p>

Why are you taking the 2 BG levels?  You don't need the extra AB.<br><br>Personally, I'd take two levels of Rogue for UMD/Tumble/Evasion.  But I'd probably take one around 22 and one around 37.  You could also take SD for HiPS/Tumble/Evasion.<br><br>I like the rest.  I feel that you need at a minimum of 15 cleric pre-epic for GMW+5 and more is good for mass heals and silent mass heals.  I'm starting to really like bards.  They really help the party with their song/curse.  Plus they have keen, ii, gmw, etc to help party also.  But I'd probably take about 15cleric and 16 bard sooner and add a level of rogue somewhere and then mix up the rest of the levels as I see fit for the world I play on.  That way you are VERY useful around 32 all they way to 40.<br><br>-pc

I'm taking the BG for the dark blessing, since I have a nice charisma score that works pretty well. Bard already has umd and tumble so the only thing rogue would give would be evasion and that would come at the cost of an xp penaltie.<br><br>SD is an option for sure, but I feel that BG is more usefull. Depends on the environment a bit I guess.

Well, that would also give an xp penalty and you wouldn't have access to the (short duration) stacking blackguard bulls strength. <br><br>You would get to add your charisma to your saves a bit faster and get access to martial weapons a bit faster.<br>You could also take one more cleric level to gain one level 7 and one level 9 spell.<br><br>Personaly I don't think is worth the xp penalty, but ymmw of course.

That is of course true, but that would also kinda make it pointless since you wouldn't have the benefits from it untill level 40.
