Hey guys,<br><br>I have a question pertaining to casters.  Since I rarely play a caster, maybe the experienced wizards and sorcerers here can help me out.<br><br>On the persistant world I play on, there's a side quest where you battle Odin.  The challenge is that you must do 10,000 damage in 1½ minutes.  I don't know if that's even possible for a caster.  Even without the time constraint, is it possible for a caster to do THAT much damage on a single set of memorized spells?  That is, do that much damage without using that spell loop thing?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>King Harbromm

Hmm... it depends on the critter's inmunities.<br><br>I think that a few maximized IGMS could do the job. You could combine it with a couple area spells to help raising the damage, such as horrid wilting, fire storm, acid fog... anything that adds. And... if he is fighting back, use the damage shields.<br><br>If your caster is hasted (quicken spell might help here too) it should be possible to do it.<br><br>I play on a PW where critters and bosses have really high HP's too, for high level critters the HP uses to be around 5000 and for high level bosses it uses to be 10000 or more (The smite evil trick is just an scratch for them <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  Even from the damage adept). My cleric uses to deal 9500+ OR 4500+ HP damage (depending on the creature) with a single harm to those creatures that aren't inmune. It could do the job too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> .<br>_________________<br>HEAD KNIGHT: Shh shh. We are now the Knights Who Say Ekke ekke ekke ptang zoo boing!<br>RANDOM: Ni!

That's some challenge, 10000 hp in 15 rounds!<br><br>If you want to damage Odin with direct damage spells, you'll have to do 667 HP/round. Hasted, with 2 castings/round a lvl 40 caster can damage 480 hp/round with maxed IGMS or flame arrow. The other direct damage spells aren't better. So that alone won't be enough, even if you have enough spell slots for 30 castings.<br><br>Another tactic is to let Odin hit you. If your lvl 40 caster has cast Mestils acid sheath, Elemental shield and Death armor, you'll inflict 128-141 hp damage on the attacker when hit. If Odin hits you 4 times per round for 15 rounds, that will damage him 7680-8460 hp. <br><br>You could bring along your familiar and a summon. If they are able to hit Odin, then maybe you would generate enough damage together with your direct damage spells?<br>But if they distract him, he won't hit your damage shields so often, so I'm not sure if that's a good idea.<br><br>Another tactic is to use spells that cause instant death, thus omitting the 10000 hps.<br>So maybe you should load up with Weird, Wail of banshee, Finger of death, Phantasmal killer and Prismatic spray! Power word kill is useless here, since it only works on creatures with less than 100 hp. It would also be interesting to see what Flesh to stone would do with this Odin.<br><br>If nothing of this works, you should bring a party and let the cleric Harm him down to 1d4 hps before you finish him off with a cantrip. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

It all boils down to: what's Odin immune to? Is autofail on 1 turned on or off? <br><br>The answers to these questions will determine whether or not a caster can down him.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

From looking at both the Druid and Cleric spell lists, the combo of the two casting together will kill anything xD. Druid DR spells and buffs + awesome Cleric Buffs. Then think... Stonehold + Creeping Doom + Blade Barrier. The Druid can also cast extended Owl's Insight on the Cleric for +12 WIS. Pow. I just had to say that <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> .<br><br>Harm harm harm away then poke it with a stick and it falls lalala...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Jennalee on 09/23/05 16:02</span></i></p>

Well, being that it's a side quest I'm going to guess that Odin's immune to any "cheap shot."  Unless you legitimately do 10,000 damage you're not going to beat him.  That takes out Dev. Crit (banned on the server anyway), Harm, and death magics.<br><br>Do you think Puff would stand a chance?<br><br>King Harbromm
