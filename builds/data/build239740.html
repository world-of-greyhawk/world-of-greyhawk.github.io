Nothing much to say, its decent AA build, there's a lot of AA builds but when I did a search, I didn't see one with the same leveling, so here it is.

nice idea.. there's a couple of issues with it first off:<br><br>Assuming you are going Half-Elf of course:<br>-There is no normal feat taken at 18th level<br>-No Epic Weapon Specialization: Longbow?<br>-21st Weapon Focus: Longbow talen for the 2nd time? I assume it should read EWF:Longbow and EWS: Longbow instead?<br>-Actual HP should be 498 not 525<br><br>Discipline 42<br>Tumble 40<br>Spellcraft 40<br>UMD 43<br>Perform 7 <b>(only need adjusted of 6 with 2 Bard Levels)</b><br>AC 30 (naked)<br><br>Fort:26<br>Will: 19 <b>(should be 17)</b><br>Reflex:34<br>Also you have a natural +2 vs Mind Spells thanks to being a Half-Elf<br>AB (melee) 31<br>AB (ranged) <b>59 (1 higher)</b><br><br>Other than that, there are improvements to the build that you can make. Currently you have no KD/ IKD or Blind Fight, which are invaluable to you.<br><br>Seriously consider dropping all three of Dodge, Mobility and Spring Attack:<br>-Dodge only gives you 1 AC against your current target or last attacker<br>-Mobility only gives you +4 Dodge AC against AoO. <br>-Spring Attack removes AoO as you move around in combat (as an archer you shouldn't be in this position, and with Tumble over 15 ranks this is negated anyway)<br><br>If you take 3 Bard and Fighter 10, you then have three points to dump in Tumble, UMD, Spellcraft &amp; Taunt (not to mention Discipline as well). Your Bard Song gives you an extra +2 total damage and +1 to your Fort Save, so if you squeeze in Lingering Song, the duration is extended a further 5 rounds, and you now have 3 uses/ day. Another benefit is knowing a 3rd 1st level spell and a 2nd castable use per day. Quite a few pluses really. <br><br>One major thing to remember with Dex Based builds is your armor type. If you do not have Uncanny Dodge, which you don't, there will be a frequent loss to your Dex based AC, when caught either flat-footed or attacked by a hidden/ invisible creature.<br><br>Below is a suggested path to take:<br><br>STR: 12<br>DEX: 14 (32)<br>CON: 16<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 12<br><br>01: Fighter(1): Luck of Heros, Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>02: Fighter(2): Point Blank Shot<br>03: Fighter(3): Toughness<br>04: Fighter(4): DEX+1, Weapon Specialization: Longbow, (DEX=15)<br>05: Fighter(5)<br>06: Fighter(6): Called Shot, Rapid Shot<br>07: Fighter(7)<br>08: Fighter(8): DEX+1, Knockdown, (DEX=16)<br>09: Bard(1): Lingering Song<br>10: Arcane Archer(1)<br>11: Arcane Archer(2)<br>12: Arcane Archer(3): DEX+1, Improved Critical: Longbow, (DEX=17)<br>13: Arcane Archer(4)<br>14: Arcane Archer(5)<br>15: Arcane Archer(6): Blind Fight<br>16: Arcane Archer(7): DEX+1, (DEX=18)<br>17: Arcane Archer(8)<br>18: Arcane Archer(9): Improved Knockdown<br>19: Arcane Archer(10)<br>20: Fighter(9): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br>21: Arcane Archer(11): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=20)<br>22: Bard(2)<br>23: Arcane Archer(12)<br>24: Arcane Archer(13): DEX+1, Great Dexterity II, (DEX=22)<br>25: Arcane Archer(14): Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br>26: Arcane Archer(15)<br>27: Fighter(10): Great Dexterity III, Epic Weapon Specialization: Longbow, (DEX=23)<br>28: Arcane Archer(16): DEX+1, (DEX=24)<br>29: Arcane Archer(17)<br>30: Arcane Archer(18): Great Dexterity IV, Epic Prowess, (DEX=25)<br>31: Arcane Archer(19)<br>32: Arcane Archer(20): DEX+1, (DEX=26)<br>33: Arcane Archer(21): Great Dexterity V, (DEX=27)<br>34: Arcane Archer(22): Great Dexterity VI, (DEX=28)<br>35: Arcane Archer(23)<br>36: Arcane Archer(24): DEX+1, Great Dexterity VII, (DEX=30)<br>37: Arcane Archer(25)<br>38: Arcane Archer(26): Great Dexterity VIII, (DEX=31)<br>39: Arcane Archer(27): Armor Skin* (could be replaced with Epic Will)<br>40: Bard(3): DEX+1, (DEX=32)<br><br>Hitpoints: 494<br>Skillpoints: 232<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 27/18/34<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Mind Effects: +2<br>BAB: 29<br>AB (max, naked): 31 (melee), 58 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 31/34<br><br>Skills:<br>Discipline 43(44)<br>Lore 12(17)<br>Perform 8(9)<br>Spellcraft 43(45)<br>Taunt 43(44)<br>Tumble 40(51)<br>UMD 43(44)<br><br>Overall changes: <br>-Your ranged AB drops back to 58, which is what you quoted anyway.<br>-45 more skill ranks available<br>-Saves versus spells +9<br>-HP drop of 4 points<br>-Fort and Will save raised by +1 each<br>-AC +1 better (Armor Skin)<br>-Starting STR &amp; CHA are at 12 - no need to put points into them during the build.<br>-Wpn Spec and Epic Wpn Spec<br>-Knockdown/ Improved Knockdown/.

I was thinking the same thing christian, but it seems you noticed that before I could edit <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   . Well, no longer able to edit, i'll have to put it here<br><br>Str: 12<br>Dex: 16 (32)<br>Con:14 (16)<br>Wis: 8<br>int: 14<br>Char: 12<br><br> All you have to do to get this is change the last great Dex feat to Great Con I, and at lvl 40 increase Con by one instead of dex. This should increase playability, without harming the build. I suppose also you can keep the build feats the same, and leave con at 14, and then have 34 dex if you wanted the +1 ab/ac at the cost of some HP.

Knockdown and Improved Knockdown? what for? ranged can't use that. You could actually take Bard at level 18 instead of 22 and get Extra Music, no problem with BAB, the skills would be lower for higher levels, but it could work... the other feat, eh... Iron Will?

your right, ranged can't use that. I am testing the redone version of the build right now for a second time, and just noticed that also, so, replace IKD and KD with....Iron will. . . . and then replace then next one with whatever fits your  style the best i guess. Sorry I didnt catch that.
