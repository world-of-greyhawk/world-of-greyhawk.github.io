first time posting a build and i'm at work. i dont have the complete stats regarding skill points and saves since that info is at home and my memory is failing. <br><br>i play this dwd and varients on a high magic server such as neversummer. this is not a pvp build. there are a few things for a lvl 40 to do so that getting epic dodge late in the game isnt really bad since it's a fairly quick leveling server.  <br><br><b>playable 1 - 40 PvM</b><br>race: dwarf<br>alignment: lawful evil<br><br>start stats from recollection:(almost min/max)<br><br>str 08<br>dex 18<br>con 18<br>wis 08<br>int 12<br>cha 06<br><br>10 skill lvls:CON 4,8,12 DEX 16,20,24,28,32,36, CON 40.<br><br>7 epic feats: 6x great dex, epic dodge <br><br>01 ftr1 -dodge, toughness<br>02 ftr2*weapon finesse<br>03 ftr3 -exotic<br>04 ftr4* weapon focus kukri<br>05 ftr5<br>06 ftr6*-mobility, ambidex<br>07 ftr7<br>08 dwd1<br>09 dwd2 - imp crit kukri<br>10 dwd3<br>11 dwd4<br>12 dwd5 - twf<br>13 dwd6<br>14 dwd7<br>15 dwd8 - itwf<br>16 dwd9<br>17 dwd10<br>18 ftr8*- kd,blindfight (use the crossskillpoints for sd)<br>19 sd1<br>20 sd2<br>21 dwd11- gdex1<br>22 dwd12<br>23 dwd13<br>24 dwd14*-gdex2 *epic weapon focus kukri<br>25 sd3<br>26 sd4<br>27 sd5 - gdex3<br>28 sd6<br>29 sd7 <br>30 sd8 - gdex4<br>31 sd9<br>32 dwd15<br>33 dwd16- gdex5<br>34 dwd17<br>35 dwd18<br>36 dwd19*- gdex6 *dr1<br>37 sd10<br>38 dwd20<br>39 dwd21 - epic dodge<br>40 dwd22*dr2<br><br>* ARE BONUS FEATS<br><br>Max tumble on sd lvls.<br>Should have enough skill points left to max disc and dump skillpoints elsewhere for either sd skills or dwd skills.  <br><br>AB<br>19 pre-epic<br>10 post epic<br>10  from 30 dex<br> 3 focus and epic weapon focus<br>--<br>42 kukri and shield<br>40 dual wielding<br>(not calculating dex from items or eb of weapon)<br><br>AC<br>10 base<br>10 dex<br>8 tumble<br>4 from defensive stance(without loss of ab)<br>--<br>32 naked ac<br><br>HP<br>8 fiter lvls 10x8 = 80<br>10 sd lvls 8x10 = 80<br>22 dwd lvls 12x 22 = 264<br>toughness = 40<br>22 con 6x40 = 240<br>---<br>704HP<br>(without con items on)<br><br>I played a 9mnk/5sd/26dwd build on the same server and needed a little more ab and more crits.

Congrats on your first post Sikk. Interesting, non-standard blend of classes you've picked. Very nice.<br><br>I was wondering where your damage comes from and what is this character's role in a party?<br><br>With a strength of 8 and wee little kukris, I don't get a sense of much damage output.<br><br>Accordingly, is this character a doable soloist? Or is he a damage sponge for a party setting?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br><i>This space for rent</i>

Yeah, I'd guess this is a damage sponge/distraction build, Sikk?<br><br>With Kukris and that low STR, your base damage is only going to be 3 points maximum.<br><br>I'd be interested in how it survives for the first few levels.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Thanks,<br><br>On the server I play, there is alot of magical properties on weapons so dmg comes primarily from that.  I debated on posting the build due to the reason that the dmg is dependent on the enchantments on the weapons, but it's normally the case with kukri wielders.  You either use it to get sneak dmg or have some type of decent enchantment on the weapon to crit with; so, for those servers where high magic weapons are available, this is an alternative character build.  I played a varient of it on another high magic server with less magical properties and I was critting for 120s whereas on the current server I play on, I crit for 250+ to give you an idea. You can imagine what the epic mobs do to you in return so the dr, epic dodge, and hp help.<br><br>The character can solo, but when I see builds, it's hard to say how good they really are until they are tested on one's own server.  Against high ab, low dmg critters, it works wonders - against AAs for example.  It's also a party player and the first to run into battle to soak up the arrows, horrids, and yes, even hellballs.<br>_________________<br>People with no lives try to live others.

Cool. (Congrats on your first build post here, btw).<br><br>Generally, people tend to post a build that's not reliant on items. Then, it's up to the player using the template to tweak it for their particular environment.<br><br>However, where you've cleared that up, it's certainly an interesting build. I bet it's actually a fun one to play once you get rolling on it.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
