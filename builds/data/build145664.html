This was originally intended as an anti-shifter build (good AB w/ lots of damage, decent saves, etc.) but I don't think it will work against the wizard-type builds.  Still turned out to be an interesting character and haven't seen any with this class mix (sorry if I missed anybody), so I thought I would post. . .<br><br>Stats<br>ST 15 -&gt; 26<br>DX 14<br>CO 12<br>IN 10<br>WI 16<br>CH  8<br><br>Level Progression: Rgr 1, Mnk 1, Rgr 2-11, Mnk 2-4, Rgr 12-16, Clc 1-5, Rgr 17-21, Clc 6, Mnk 5, Rgr 22, Clc 7-12, Mnk 6<br><br>It's a little all-over, but this seemed to make the character more playable at all levels.<br><br>Feats:<br>1) Dodge; Weapon Focus: Kama<br>3) Disarm<br>6) Power Attack<br>9) Toughness<br>12) Improved Critical: Kama<br>15) Great Cleave<br>18) Improved Initiative<br>21) Extend Spell; Domains: Strength and War<br>24) Epic WF: Kama<br>27) Great Strength I<br>30) Overwhelming Critical: Kama<br>33) Bane of Enemies<br>36) Devastating Critical: Kama<br>39) Epic Skill Focus: Discipline<br><br>You can change the last feat to anything, I did this because I wanted to resist Knockdown (common in Dragon builds).  This is a well-rounded character though, so you don't have to focus on that.  It plays well in many different circumstances.  Monk 6 also gives you Improved Knockdown which seemed worth it versus some of alternatives (Rgr 26 would net 2 epic feats, but bring Monk levels down to 2).  Again, Cleric 15 would get you slightly better buffs, but you're already at +19 AB w/ everything on as it is.<br><br>End Result:<br>Naked AC 24 (can be buffed much higher)<br>Max HP 444 (not bad for this type of build)<br>BA 29<br>Attk: +40/+37/+34/+31/+28/+25/+40/+37 (that's what the computer said, though I find it hard to track)<br>W/ Buffs: +59/+56/+53/+50/+47+/+44/+59/+56<br>Hasting should bring you to 11 attacks/round<br><br>Damage:<br>Minimum -- No buffs 72/rd (8*9, not so good)<br>Min + Favored 136/rd (8*17)<br>Min + Buffs 272/rd (8*34)<br>Min + Favored + Buffs 336/rd (8*42)<br><br>Maximum -- No buffs 112/rd (8*14)<br>Max + Favored 256/rd (8*32)<br>Max + Buffs 352/rd (8*44)<br>Max + Favored + Buffs 496/rd (8*62)<br><br>The Divine Strength and Battle Master are short-lived due to low Charisma, so you probably do not want to stack them (they are stacked for numbers above).<br><br>This character will have difficult time w/ high AC opponents and those w/ lots of damage reduction.  Though good, the saves are not fantastic, so this character will have issues w/ spell casters.  If buffs are dispelled, this build will have difficult time.<br><br>All thoughts, suggestions, etc. are welcome.

Cool build.  You are gonna have to wait till lvl 3 for wf kama though, since you don't have the proficiency to use it at level one, and if you do monk level first you will lack the 1 bab.  Other than that it looks great, you'll have decent ac when you buff wis and dex and plenty of dmg with str and buffs.<br><br>Unless you are set on getting divine power early ya might want to consider trickery domain for imp invisibilty(best buff in game imo) or healing so you can have a decent amount of heals you can cast.

Sorry, I missed that in correcting my excel when I did the build.  To your point, switch w/ Disarm, move Power Attack up, etc.<br><br>Trickery would be a good switch.  The special powers don't last that long, so switching one out for Imp Invisibility would help the character more.<br><br>Thanks for the suggestions.
