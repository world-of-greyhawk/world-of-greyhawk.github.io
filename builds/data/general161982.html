Hey all,<br><br>I was trying to rework a build i posted in the epic char forum and i was getting something strange occuring:  according to all my notes, cot epics get a bonus feat on lvls 13, 16 etc.   These past 2 days, i wasnt able to get this to happen!  It seems that now the CoT takes the bonus feats on 14, 18!   Did i miss something in the 1.64 update info?  <br><br>anyone have any ideas?

COTs always got bonus feats in 4 level gaps, or at least since 1.61, another example of how usefull the manuel is, I sure would like to meet that proof reading team.  Must be the same ones that work on goverment documents.

You know, this is just one more reason to hang up the old mouse and get a real life  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>I find it terribly pathetic that a company changes things that seem so irrelevant (i know, balance issue)<br><br>btw, i did test the build i posted and i was gettin the feats on 13 16  so i have NO idea.<br><br>peace
