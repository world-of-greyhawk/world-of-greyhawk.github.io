I came up with this idea when I noticed that Champs of Torm have access to Epic class feats that are great for casters.  I built him with tons of IGMS and ILMS and Magic Missiles, just for kicks.  I had also considered going Sorcerer, but with the way Pale Master works v. caster spell access, I couldn't get access to 9th level spells without taking all 17 of the necessary Sorc levels.  So I made him a Wizard instead.<br><br>Pros:<br>-- 2 Epic Spells<br>-- Auto Still Spell III and Auto Quicken Spell III<br>-- Epic Damage Reduction III<br>-- Large amount of skill points<br>-- Can use

You are going to have an extremely hard time with spell resistance on this build. Your caster level is only 12. You may be better off stopping pm levels at 10 and putting the rest into wiz. Maybe doing s 20/10/10 level split would result in a slightly stronger overall charcter.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Emrill on 07/20/04 17:12</span></i></p>

Yeah, I wondered about that too.  I figured taking all of the spell penetration feats would take care of that.  That's assuming that the feats stack, which I'm not sure about.<br><br>And yeah, I could probably make a more even distribution.  My only concern would be with feats -- I'd lose 2 (as well as +4 AC, but whatever) by dropping PM to 10, and if I drop CoT to 10, that's another one.  All of which are Epic feats.  So I could drop the DR feats without too much problem, I guess.  Or Auto Quicken.<br><br>Thoughts from the gallery?<br>_________________<br>-------------------------------<br>"What do you fear most in the world?"<br>"The possibility that love is not enough."<br>-- Major Garland Briggs, Twin Peaks

The only thing you can do about your spell penetration is to take at least another 15-20 lvls of caster, so forget about it.  Against a caster/cleric you can dispell their spell resistance and agaisnst a monk let em nail your elemental shields.  I think you got a good setup atm, though the usefullness of auto-quicken is up for debate.

Interesting Build--I'll have to try it later, though I'm not much on caster builds (I can never keep up with what I'm supposed to be doing! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    I'm much better with "Gronk smash!").  Oh, and the spell resist feats do not stack.  I was looking at this earlier for something else.

Well, I did just test a different set up.  With a final build of Wiz 20/PM16/CoT 4, the only feat I lost from the previous version is Epic DR III.  And it just pimpslapped a dracolich in 1 round, a prismatic in 2.  I'll post the particulars in a new thread later today.<br>_________________<br>-------------------------------<br>"What do you fear most in the world?"<br>"The possibility that love is not enough."<br>-- Major Garland Briggs, Twin Peaks

I wonder about Auto Quicken too.  But it's a good choice from the available feats at the particular levels, and if it works as described, I can get off multiple 9th level spells in a casting period without using up spell slots.  But there's always a difference between how the manual describes things and how they work in the game.

If you know you can keep yourself hasted, autoquicken is fairly useless.

Theoretically wouldn't auto-quicken stack w/ haste?  Meaning if haste makes you twice as fast (3 actions per 2 rounds I believe) and auto-quicken allows the casting of 2 spells in one round, wouldn't that be 6 actions in 2 rounds?  They are separate actions that would layer on top of each other.  I've been playing around with this too -- different build, like W 35/M 5 -- but I'm not sure how to taste it for accuracy.
