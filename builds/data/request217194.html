The only way to get "as high as ab as u can get" you cannot go dd.  The feat structure for dds isnt conducive to a dexer though.  Going 26 lvls will net you 4 bonus dd feats.  You have to start with a base dex of max 16 (to have a reasonable character), with 10 stats you would have 26.  Assume 5 gr dex with epic feats.. well 4 cuz you'd want an even number.  Take epic prwess and ewf as dd feats.  Then what?  dd feats open to you are epic toughness and armor skin.  Interesting...<br><br>Looking at preepic, you need 6 or those lvls pre, maybe 7 if you take fighter (recommended) to get wpn spec and epic ws epic (which makes an interesting point, you could use the feat that you are not taking gr dex 5 with to do this).  That leaves the pos of ftr6/wm7/dd7 pre epic.  hmm.. (note: take ws at lv 6 ftr with ww).  <br><br>The end result would be a dexer with base of 30 (not bad) with plenty of dd reduction.  The ab wont be terribly high though... im guessin bout 40 or so (im at work so i dont have the time).  <br><br>HERE's the thing: you are a dexer WITHOUT epic dodge!  I think if you ask anyone who knows anythin bout dexers, you dont really wanna do that!  NOw, being a dd, you could punch up the con to get epic DR3.. but then your ab will be in the toilet.   hmmm.<br><br>So, in the final analysis, is a dexer dd viable?  yes.  Is it playable?   sure.  Is it livable?  not so sure.  Epic dodge is a very useful feat for chars that are "out there", so to speak (with nothing but a robe to save their skins).   Im sure that some will poke holes in this, thats cool.  I am not a huge dexer (YET).. my first attempt at a dexer is now lv 10, and is a cleric <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    so what do i know (but he will have epic dodge).<br><br>Hope that ramblin helps.   Good luck with the idea, and thanks for suggesting it.  I never thought of mixin the 2 ideas before, but as i sit here, i am beginning to see the sheer pleasure of having a damage wall doin cartwheels around a battle area!<br><br>ROFLMAO  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>peace

The neccesity of Epic dodge/uncanny dodge and the like is really subjective. Though I argree that a Dex DD is pretty useless. For a competative dexxer you need 36 dex at 40.<br>_________________<br>~I am the wisest man on earth because I know one thing, and that is I know nothing.~<br>-Cairne

Maybe if you're going for all out damage as a dexxer but if you're going for SC V and misc. other feats, you're going to end up with about 32 DEX at most (possibly more if you're an assassin).<br><br>If you want a dex DD with ED, may I suggest Rogue/DD with probably SD or CoT for the third class. CoT will help your saves and help you get your EDR feats if you're planning on getting them and you can use some of the general ones for Great DEX.<br><br>Well, some recent investigations on Epic Dodge on the General Discussion boards seem to suggest that Epic Dodge doesn't only block the first attack but can block more than one per round (bugged?). That would mean it's far, far more useful than you'd think; far overpowered even.<br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

If you wanna go DEX you should aim for ED and SC (IV at least) IMHO. And it's possible to build an effective DwD dexxer with AB 43, ED, SCIV (or V), lotsa sneaks, etc. You need rogue though and not WM for that (or SD otherwise, but you lose the sneaks and UMD, plus you need to CC to meet the requirements).<br><br>If you want to keep WM anyhow, I'd suggest on the fly  FTR 6/WM 16/DD 18...but I'd choose the STR route for such a build<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail
