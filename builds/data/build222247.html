The Godstricken Archer<br><br>MY goal here was to answer a question about the viability of a Cleric AA. I took it with  pinch of salt and decided to make this, and I am quite pleased.<br><br>I never liked clerics so I decided to make him a Cleric hunting machine, bent on using fire to fight fire. He has an excellent Discipline check (to avoid IKD spam, which clerics are quite proud of), as well as his awesom AB and not terrible AC.<br><br>Stats<br>Str - 8<br>Dex - 18 (36)<br>Con - 12<br>Wis - 14<br>Int - 10<br>Cha - 14<br><br>Take all Dex at lvls 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40<br>Take in order: Epic Prowess, Armor Skin*, Great Dex (5 times)<br>AA Feats in order: Epic Focus, Great Dex (3 Times)<br><br>This puts us up to 36 dex by lvl 40. Final AB calculations:<br><br>BAB - 27<br>EA* - 14<br>Fts -  5<br>DEX - 13 (higher buffed)<br>------------------------<br>AB  - 59 UNBUFFED<br>*Enchant Arrow<br><br>Add cleric buffs:<br>Prayer 1<br>Bless  1<br>D.P*   3<br>Aid    1<br>C.G*<br>---------<br>Bonus  6<br><br>Buffed AB - 66:evillol:, 63 After 8 rounds, 60 after 8 minutes, 59 after 8 hours.<br><br>*Divine Power, Cat's Grace<br><br>AC:<br>10 Base<br>13 Dexterity<br> 2 Armor SKin<br> 8 Tumble<br>--<br>33 Naked unbuffed AC<br><br>Buffed AC<br>10 Base<br>14 Dexterity<br> 2 Armor Skin<br> 8 Tumble<br> 2 Divine Shield<br>--<br>36 Naked Buffed AC<br><br>On Antiworld (+5 max on all items exept save rings)<br>your best AC would be<br>10 Base<br>19 Dexterity (+12 items)<br> 2 Armor Skin<br> 4 Divine Shield<br> 8 Tumble<br> 5 Natural AC modifier<br> 5 AC modifier<br> 5 AC Deflection Modifier<br>---<br>58 Fully Buffed AC for 4 rounds (Nymph Cloak +4 used, If I added Epic Helm of Persuasion it could go up to +8 enhancement to CHA and thus +6 to AC over 6 rounds, but there would be little change due to loss of my dex helm...)<br><br>This is of course requiring feats which I am going to work out or you. You need Focus, P.B.S, Rapid Shot, Toughness, and I Reccomend Extra Turning. You have to sacrifice Called Shot and Improved Critical to gain your Divine Shield feat, which is a small loss of effectiveness, So I reccomend taking feats in this order:<br>(Bard 4 is first)<br>P.B.S (point blank)<br>Focus<br>Extra Turning<br>Power Atk<br>Divine Sheild<br>Rapid Shot<br>Toughness<br><br>Alternatively you could sacrifice extra turning in favor of improved critical (Depends on ideology - PvP do it, PvM, don't its less resting)<br><br>Level up order:<br><br>*Pre-Epic*<br>Bard 4<br>Cleric 8<br>AA 8<br>***Epic***<br>AA 19<br>Bard 1<br><br>Damage would be <br>1d8+14 (19-20x3 if you took Imp crit)<br>For a total of 18.5 phys/hit<br>Criticals will be 55.5 on 19-20<br>Total Average Damage per round (including critical frequency) is 22.2*5 (rapid shot) = 111 pts per round<br><br>Another note would be that Bless and Prayer add +2 to damage, Bumping us up only slightly.<br><br>Final Leveling Progression (For all u lazy ppls)<br>1.

This will provied extra elemental hardiness for us to enjoy. The Route of Cold and Fire gives us immunity to all but the top 4 Darkfire spells (ones with +6 - +10 or lvl 12-20 cleric) and grants us a moderation of resistance to Ice Storms. The other route makes us 100% immune to most fire-based effects (100% of all Darkfire and alows us to resist most of a maximized flame arrow (24 dmg/missile = 4 dmg / missile), but we can run the risk of damage from cold sources once they realize our specialization in resisting fire spells.<br><br>Well, thats the God Stricken Archer. I would like any and all feedback you can give.<br><br>Please dont flame the Cleric stuff, but he is on the right side, and I intend him to ruthelessly hunt those freakin powergamers!!!<br>DEATH TO CLERICS <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">
