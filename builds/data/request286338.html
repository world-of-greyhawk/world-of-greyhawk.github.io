Hello i'm playing on Eternal War Armageedon. It's on arena category. When answering my question you ought to have a look at it because there alot of changes to classes and OP and UP items.<br><br>I was wondering if someone could find me a really good sneaking build that's good from level 7-20. The module starts at level 7 all the way to 20 then you stop leveling. It's PvP only and must be good enough to be able to replace a stat helm with a Phantasmal Killer(Over used spell on this module) helm or used with a stat helm and good saves.<br><br>I think that's all really.<br><br>Kind Regards<br>Willwoms<br>_________________<br>Willwoms is the most super,  amazing, fabulous, marvellous, exciting, dangerous and lethal dex sneak in Life vs Death.Well will be eventually. *slits your throat*.
