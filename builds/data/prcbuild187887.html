I don't know if it's just me, but using general feats on Epic Toughness seems like a waste to me. In the very least, you could take at least one Great INT feat so your INT is an even 30. Also, it looks like you use a number of the EK bonus feats to take it to. It makes a lot more sense to spend them on something more worthwhile, than 20 extra HP each.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By groundcoffee on 03/30/05 22:12</span></i></p>

Yeah I agree, but unfortunatly the EK only gets to chose from the Fighter feats, Epic Toughness made most sense of the once I had to pick from since the final HP would be less than 300 and that's a bit too low for a fighter.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By MartinJHolm on 03/31/05 11:03</span></i></p>

Name thief!<br><br>Apart from that, why such great intelligence if ylou don't even take spell focus in any of the schools? To spam lots and lots of IGMSs? I think a sorcerer would be better for this job.

Sorry I didn't see any builds called the same here, i apologize if I took the name from someone else!!!<br><br>High intelligence to make saves harder, I didn't have any grand scheme with the build just wanted a char the was an effective spellcaster but still could work as a fighter of sorts.

How about taking 20 sorcerer/4 fighter/16 eldritch knight, or other combo like that then? Apart from having a few HPs more, I don't see a reason for taking mane levels of EK post-epic.
