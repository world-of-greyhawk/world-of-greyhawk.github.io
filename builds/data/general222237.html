Its an RPG game. High tech stuff. Like DnD but the future. You get guns, any weapons you want. Actually the RPG is really like the movie Matrix. They have guys called deckers that hack into comptures and stuff. you can get bioware put on you body, such as wired reflexes. They got burnt out mages too, riggers who jack cars. you cant be a demolitions expert too. you also get a list of contacts that you are familar with. These people will give you tips on the street. Really really really fun game.
