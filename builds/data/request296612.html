Well I'm playing in a server with pvp but mainly PvM. I want to build a pvp character now so I 'm not interested how well it does in PvM but mainly focusing on PvP abilities. The fact is that many people run from PvP and I hate that ! Well thats why they must die ! So I 'm trying to figure a fast running killing machine.<br><br>My server supports up to +5 items ac, ab , stats.Mages could be a pain but many spells are nerfed and do half damage.<br><br>My main idea was to create a character that runs fast and deals death quickly like a monk dever,with a scimmy maybe.<br><br>I am between 2 ideas . The first one is a monk 20 ( for SR and speed and other nice monk things) and 20 Bard for Song and buffs and UMD) . The other idea is 10 monk ( the speed will be still good and with a proper sub might run faster )/20 Bard again for song , curse song and umd )/ and Rdd 10 for all the nice abilities . <br><br>I would like it to be a dever and i dont care if he is not using a kama. Because i'm  aiming for dev crit. I 'm not  sure now about the AC output . It seems to me that wil be pretty low and I wouldnt like to meet a WM... <br><br>Any input in this would be appreciated . <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Monk has to be Lawful, and Bard cannot be Lawful, so you can't have both classes in the same build, unless you are willing and able to make an alignment shift every time you go from one to the other. Some PWs don't allow alignment shift at all. Therefore, to have a Monk-RDD, you have to use Sorcerer to gain access to RDD. I suggest Monk 25 / Sorcerer 1 / RDD 14. The extra 4 levels of RDD gives you a bonus feat and 4 levels with d12 hit dice (and a stronger Dragon Breath, but nobody ever uses that).<br><br>Dual-wielding kamas would give you more attacks per round, and therefore more chances at dev crit.<br><br>When I made my <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "293884", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Order of the Wyrm</a> build, I also made this variation that uses Kamas, but didn't post it, until now. If you really don't care about PvM, you could shuffle some skill points around to drop Lore and Persuade, putting those 27 points into Spot on RDD levels.<br><br><b>Order of the Wyrm II (Monk 25 / Sorcerer 1 / Red Dragon Disciple 14)</b><br>Human, Any Lawful<br>PvM or PvP, Playable 1 - 40<br><br><i>Abilities:</i><br>STR: 16 (36)<br>DEX: 14 (16)<br>CON: 14 (16)<br>WIS: 14<br>INT: 10 (12)<br>CHA: 8 (10)<br><br><i>Leveling Guide:</i><br>Human: (Quick to Master)<br>01: Monk(1): Blind Fight, Two-Weapon Fighting, {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br>02: Monk(2): {Deflect Arrows}<br>03: Monk(3): Weapon Focus: Kama<br>04: Monk(4): DEX+1, (DEX=15)<br>05: Monk(5)<br>06: Monk(6): Ambidexterity, {Knockdown, Improved Knockdown}<br>07: Monk(7)<br>08: Monk(8): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>09: Monk(9): Power Attack, {Improved Evasion}<br>10: Monk(10)<br>11: Monk(11)<br>12: Monk(12): STR+1, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, (STR=18)<br>13: Monk(13)<br>14: Monk(14)<br>15: Monk(15): Improved Critical: Kama<br>16: Monk(16): STR+1, (STR=19)<br>17: Monk(17)<br>18: Monk(18): Great Cleave<br>19: Monk(19)<br>20: Monk(20): STR+1, (STR=20)<br>21: Sorcerer(1): Epic Weapon Focus: Kama<br>22: Red Dragon Disciple(1)<br>23: Red Dragon Disciple(2): (STR=22)<br>24: Monk(21): STR+1, Overwhelming Critical: Kama, (STR=23)<br>25: Red Dragon Disciple(3)<br>26: Red Dragon Disciple(4): (STR=25)<br>27: Monk(22): Devastating Critical: Kama<br>28: Red Dragon Disciple(5): STR+1, (STR=26)<br>29: Red Dragon Disciple(6)<br>30: Red Dragon Disciple(7): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=16), (CON=16)<br>31: Red Dragon Disciple(8)<br>32: Monk(23): STR+1, (STR=27)<br>33: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Great Strength I, (STR=28), (INT=12)<br>34: Red Dragon Disciple(10): {Darkvision}, (STR=32), (CHA=10)<br>35: Red Dragon Disciple(11)<br>36: Red Dragon Disciple(12): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=34)<br>37: Monk(24)<br>38: Red Dragon Disciple(13)<br>39: Red Dragon Disciple(14): Great Strength III, Epic Prowess, (STR=35)<br>40: Monk(25): STR+1, Armor Skin, (STR=36)<br><br><i>Stats:</i><br>Hitpoints: 456<br>Skillpoints: 192<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 25/24/25<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Mind Effects: +2<br>BAB: 25<br>AB (max, naked): 42 (melee), 29 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 34/34<br>Spell Casting: <br>Alignment Changes: 0<br><br><i>Skills:</i><br>Discipline 43(56), Listen 43(45), Lore 13(14), Persuade 14(14), Spellcraft 39(40), Tumble 40(43)<br><br>01: Discipline(4), Listen(4), Lore(4), Persuade(4), Tumble(4)<br>02: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(1)<br>03: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(1)<br>04: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(1)<br>05: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(1)<br>06: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(1)<br>07: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(1)<br>08: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(1)<br>09: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(1), Save(1)<br>10: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(1), Save(3)<br>11: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(1), Save(5)<br>12: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(1), Save(7)<br>13: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(1), Save(9)<br>14: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(1), Save(11)<br>15: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(1), Save(13)<br>16: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(1), Save(15)<br>17: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(1), Save(17)<br>18: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(1), Save(19)<br>19: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(1), Save(21)<br>20: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(1), Save(23)<br>21: Spellcraft(24), Save(2)<br>22: Discipline(2), Listen(2), Spellcraft(1)<br>23: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(1)<br>24: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(4)<br>25: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1)<br>26: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1)<br>27: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(3)<br>28: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1)<br>29: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1)<br>30: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(1)<br>31: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(2)<br>32: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(5)<br>33: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1)<br>34: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(2)<br>35: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(2)<br>36: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(1)<br>37: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(5)<br>38: Spellcraft(4)<br>39: Discipline(2), Listen(2)<br>40: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Lore(2), Persuade(2)<br>_________________<br>Great Research Tools:<br><a href="http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">NWNWiki</a><br><a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/nwn1/builds/search/index.php" target="_blank">NWN Epic Character Build Search Engine</a><br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/" target="_blank">The NWN Vault</a>

Nothing personal, but you did notice that your build has NO TRUE STRIKE, right?  Lose some starting Con for Cha.  With 25 levels of Monk for speed, True Strike is all kinds of useful in PvP (which is what he asked the build to be for - even mentioning stopping runners), and not <br>having it is a total shame.<br><br><i>Edited out excessive quoting - Grimnir </i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 05/23/08 06:04</span></i></p>

I didn't set out to make a caster. Do you really want to give up all that health for a couple castings of a short-lived buff that can be dispelled with little more than a sneeze? That single Sorcerer level is there for the sole purpose of gaining access to RDD.

Sadly, I tried and I've to agree.<br>In PvP only noobs and meleers without spellcraft are "victims" of True Strike.<br>The others just keep running away or around until the spell expires.<br>Moreover, you lose one full action to cast it and you're susceptible (right word?) of AoO, AoE spells, ranged attacks and so.<br>Really, if you're a monk the last thing you want is to allow a spellcaster to use Time Stop or Bigbys.

I 've read all the feedback on my first post and was very helpfull. I tried the build 25monk 1 sorc 14 rdd and it was pretty good ( Thank you Empyre65 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  ) . Extra fast and kicks around dmg. Only drawback is the lack of buffs which would be usefull for some pvp. That is what i want to have with 20 bard or even 16.<br><br>I forgot to mention that there is no alignment restrictions on my server so a bard can fit in a build with monk. <br>I thought of it and since i want him a dever i might get a scimmy instead of a kama. I'm just trying to weight the pros and cons of wide threat range OR more APR.<br><br>For the moment i'm testing a 20bard /12 monk / 8 Cot. but i'm thinking to switch to 20 bard/10 monk/10 rdd. <br><br>About True strike (Hiwatt) wont be a problem since i will be able to cast from scrolls.<br>The speed also will not be a problem since some subraces have extra speed. so 10 monk will give some nice boost.<br>I've learned how to buil with the excel worksheet and come to this :<br><br><br><br>STR: 16 (36)<br>DEX: 10<br>CON: 14 (16)<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14 (16)<br>CHA: 14 (16)<br><br>Human: (Quick to Master: Blind fight)<br>01: Bard(1): Curse Song<br>02: Bard(2)<br>03: Bard(3): Power Attack<br>04: Bard(4): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>05: Bard(5)<br>06: Bard(6): Craft Wand<br>07: Bard(7)<br>08: Bard(8): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>09: Monk(1): Extend Spell, {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}, *Alignment Change*<br>10: Monk(2): {Deflect Arrows}<br>11: Monk(3)<br>12: Monk(4): STR+1, Weapon Focus: Kama, (STR=19)<br>13: Red Dragon Disciple(1)<br>14: Red Dragon Disciple(2): (STR=21)<br>15: Red Dragon Disciple(3): Improved Critical: Kama<br>16: Red Dragon Disciple(4): STR+1, (STR=24)<br>17: Red Dragon Disciple(5)<br>18: Red Dragon Disciple(6): Great Cleave<br>19: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=16)<br>20: Red Dragon Disciple(8): STR+1, (STR=25)<br>21: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Overwhelming Critical: Kama, (INT=16)<br>22: Red Dragon Disciple(10): {Darkvision}, (STR=29), (CHA=16)<br>23: Monk(5)<br>24: Monk(6): STR+1, Devastating Critical: Kama, {Knockdown, Improved Knockdown}, (STR=30)<br>25: Monk(7)<br>26: Monk(8)<br>27: Monk(9): Armor Skin, {Improved Evasion}<br>28: Bard(9): STR+1, (STR=31), *Alignment Change*<br>29: Bard(10)<br>30: Bard(11): Epic Weapon Focus: Kama<br>31: Bard(12)<br>32: Bard(13): STR+1, (STR=32)<br>33: Bard(14): Great Strength I, (STR=33)<br>34: Bard(15)<br>35: Bard(16)<br>36: Bard(17): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=35)<br>37: Bard(18)<br>38: Bard(19)<br>39: Bard(20): Lasting Inspiration<br>40: Monk(10): STR+1, (STR=36), *Alignment Change*<br><br>Hitpoints: 404<br>Skillpoints: 300<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 25/25/22<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Mind Effects: +2<br>BAB: 25<br>AB (max, naked): 41 (melee), 25 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 26/32<br>Spell Casting: Bard(6)<br>Alignment Changes: 3<br><br>Discipline 43(56), Lore 8(31), Perform 40(43), Pick Pocket 42(42), Spellcraft 40(43), Taunt 40(43), Tumble 40(40), UMD 40(43), remaining skillpoints 7<br><br><br>01: Save(28), <br>02: Save(35), <br>03: Save(42), <br>04: Save(49), <br>05: Save(56), <br>06: Save(63), <br>07: Save(70), <br>08: Save(77), <br>09: Save(84), <br>10: Save(91), <br>11: Save(98), <br>12: Lore(8), Save(97), <br>13: Save(102), <br>14: Save(107), <br>15: Save(112), <br>16: Save(117), <br>17: Save(122), <br>18: Save(127), <br>19: Save(132), <br>20: Save(137), <br>21: Save(142), <br>22: Save(148), <br>23: Save(156), <br>24: Save(164), <br>25: Save(172), <br>26: Save(180), <br>27: Save(188), <br>28: Save(196), <br>29: Save(204), <br>30: Save(212), <br>31: Save(220), <br>32: Save(228), <br>33: Save(236), <br>34: Save(244), <br>35: Save(252), <br>36: Save(260), <br>37: Save(268), <br>38: Save(276), <br>39: Perform(40), Pick Pocket(42), Spellcraft(40), Taunt(40), UMD(40), Save(82), <br>40: Discipline(43), Tumble(40), Save(7), <br><br><br>I chose to take craft wand in case I ge tdispelled so i can run and buff.

The one thing this doesnt have vs cot is fighter ab progression.  I always like that about the cot bard rdd.  It is also crappy that kama have 20 crit!  sorry 19-20!
