Hi there,<br><br>First of all, I prefer melee characters over the others. This is why I wanted a char who has a nice ab, nice ac, <br>can survive some spells and the bad-bad sneakies cannot kill him easily. I think he is good in PvP, but not good against mages. But hey, if you want to kill a (nearly) pure sorc, just build one. I do not like the Timestop / IGMS / Bigby style, sorry.<br><br>The char needs a VERY big alignment change from Lawful Good to Neutral (or Chaotic) Evil. Btw if you want to RP him, you will have a hard time (what will you say when your newly became chaotic evil char casts Divine Favor, eh?)<br><br>On the search engine are mainly Paladin / Bard / PM chars with more paladin levels (like 20) or more PM levels (like 28), so I don’t link any of those builds. <br><br>Okay, I think I just start it now<br><br><b>The Fallen Executor</b><br><br><i>Paladin 12 / Bard 12 / PM 16</i><br>[Paladin 12 / Bard 8 pre-epic]<br>[PM 16 / Bard 4 epic]<br><br><i>Human, Lawful Good</i> [alignment change at lvl 12: neutral/chaotic, you can change here to evil too and you dont have to do it on lvl 20]<br><br>Playable from lvl 1-40<br>PvM and PvP (except those mages)<br><br><b>Stats</b> (dont laugh)<br>STR  14  (26)<br>DEX  8<br>CON  14<br>WIS  14<br>INT  14<br>CHA  14<br><br>(Why?

This is a really neat concept, and love the name (as well as the class combo, as everyone here surely knows), so just *must* have a looksy <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">         <br><br>Your defence is good, and that's nice, but the combo could produce so much more for you. At 12 pally, you're only getting warmed up when it comes to spells (ie., aka holy sword, just so close) and 12 bard seems an odd mix; most people either take enough bard (ie., 2 to 4) for skill dumps, go to 8 for some song, or up to 15/16 at least. Regardless, under 25 you're dispellable and so doesn't help much to go beyond 8 here; but, unfortunately, you do need to hit 3rd level spells to qualify for PM (might try sorcerer instead, but okay, let's work with bard, shall we?<br><br>thinking, start str. 16, 8 dex, 12 con, 12 int and 14 cha (for a fighting chance out of the gate, so to speak since you don't take ie ikd &amp; thus don't need that much int, and w. pm ac is good and immune to crits, so your hps w. toughness is ok anyway (over 400 is sorta the starting point, which you god). I'd also take a grt str epic to round it out, as some nat offense is good. I love how youre defensive minded here, which is great, but offense is a good thing too, no? <br><br>Again, great concept, but relying a lot on buffs here, and while div shield is a great feat, still, relying on cha-buffs to raise it, too (remember, under 25 levels, dispelling is a factor, and so both your pally and your bard are vulnerable. Otherwise, really neat. I'm thinking sorc. might work better for you here than bard, which would allow you to take more pally pre-ep (thus raising your bab) since all you need for PM is to be evil and 3rd level spell-casting; this in turn would also give you more flex in terms of yer stats, but hey, me love them bards, too (ain't they great? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">  )<br><br>Just some thoughts for you.<br><br>Oh, and great also RP wise - why, when you fall of couse, your new gods, the forces of darkness, more than happy to grant you div. favors -- neat!<br><br>FALL ON!!!<br><br>Tyr<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By TyrTemplar on 01/25/07 02:18</span></i></p>

OOps, an edit may be in order: as to PM qualifications, (just in case in my hasty typing it's not clear) all that is required is that a character be of ANY non-good alignment, and ability to cast 3rd level spells. whew!

PM doesn't require the ability to cast 3rd level arcane spells, it requires 3 levels in an arcane casting class (bard, wizard, or sorcerer).  So, rather than needing Wiz 5/Sorc 6/Bard 8, it just needs Wiz 3/Sorc 3/Bard 3.<br><br>Nice build.  Is it really worth giving up access to Holy Sword for the somewhat limited (I.E. pre-16th level) use you're making of Bard Song?  I'd probably drop Bard to 8, or even 4, and bring up Paladin more.<br><br>Alternatively, you could drop Pally buffs and take a lot of bard, but then you'd start looking like the Fallen Rock Star.<br><br>It looks good, it just seems to me that you'd do better focusing more on either Paladin or Bard, rather than trying to do both.

Yes, you are right. If I drop 4 levels of bard pre-epic and take paladin instead...<br>+ Holy sword as lvl 4 paladin spell<br>+ 1 BAB<br><br>- 2 AC from bard song (still has a nice AC IMHO)<br>- 8 skill points (I would take 3 from perform [15 is required for lvl 8 bard song] and the remaining 5 from concentration)<br><br>This way you are still dispellable, but a bit more offensive.<br><br>Thanks for the replies!<br><br>*EDIT* I used bard instead of sorc for +4 AC (tumble maxing), UMD and bard song<br>_________________<br>"I will be the last...and you will go first!"<br>Sarevok, Child of Bhaal<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Praetor_Ghastkill on 01/26/07 23:25</span></i></p>
