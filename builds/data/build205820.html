<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 .PvM or PvP</b><br><br>Two things spurned this build.  The first was the success I had with Stonedeath.  There wasn't much that could take him on in toe-to-toe, much less when I could death attack people.  The second was the ridicule my Epitome of Defense took.  I wanted to rebuild my dwarven defender build and give it offense to match its defense.  While there's some mandatory sacrificing, I still think this is a pretty good build.<br><br>Moradin's Shield<br><br>Race:  Dwarf<br><br>Alignment:  Lawful Neutral<br><br>Base Attributes<br>Str 16<br>Dex 13<br>Con 18<br>Int 13<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 6<br><br>Attribute Bonuses<br>Str 4, 8, 24, 28, 32, 36<br>Con 12, 16, 20, 40 <br><br>Leveling Guide<br>Level 1:  Fighter<br>Level 2:  Monk<br>Level 3-8:  Fighter<br>Level 9-18:  Dwarven Defender<br>Level 19:  Fighter<br>Level 20:  Monk<br>Level 21-40:  Dwarven Defender<br><br>Final Level Distribution<br>Fighter 8<br>Monk 2<br>Dwarven Defender 30<br><br>Feats<br>Level 1:  Expertise, Toughness<br>Level 2:  Cleave (Monk feat)<br>Level 3:  Improved Expertise, Weapon Focus (Warhammer)<br>Level 5:  Weapon Specialization (Warhammer)<br>Level 6:  Dodge<br>Level 7:  Knockdown<br>Level 9:  Improved Knockdown<br>Level 12:  Improved Critical (Warhammer)<br>Level 15:  Blind-Fight<br>Level 18:  Power Attack<br>Level 19:  Great Cleave<br>Level 20:  Deflect Arrows (Monk feat)<br>Level 21:  Epic Damage Reduction I<br>Level 24:  Epic Damage Reduction II, Epic Damage Reduction III<br>Level 27:  Epic Weapon Focus (Warhammer)<br>Level 28:  Epic Prowess<br>Level 30:  Armor Skin<br>Level 32:  Epic Toughness I<br>Level 33:  Great Strength I<br>Level 36:  Great Strength II, Overwhelming Critical (Warhammer)<br>Level 39:  Great Strength III<br>Level 40:  Devastating Critical (Warhammer)<br><br>Final Attributes<br>Str 25<br>Dex 13<br>Con 22<br>Int 13<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 6<br><br>Hit Points (max every level)<br>776<br><br>Final Saves<br>Fortitude 32<br>Reflex 19<br>Will 21<br><br>With skills, you can pretty much do what you want.

I would sacrifice 4 DD levs epic (and thus 3/- DR) for 2 fighter and 2 monk levs to get EWS and and be able to max tumble. +4 to ac and damage for just 3 DR less is a good tradeoff IMO.  The best way to do it would probly be to drop the epic toughness feat. Other than that it is a solid build at least, tough to defeat without being able to crit it, so +4 AC is nice. It will remove 20% of crits, at least. 27/- DR will take the most out of any non-crit hit.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 07/27/05 16:40</span></i></p>
