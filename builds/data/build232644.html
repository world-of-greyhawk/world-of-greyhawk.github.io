Introduction:<br>Whisper of the Forest<br><br>Ranger/Bard/HS -- a theme/RP build (yes <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <b></b>). Decent Bard Song, Hide/MS in 60s when buffed, decent AB, AC is fairly weak but decent when DEX is buffed. Damage output is respectable, in testing I killed a 15/- DR opponent without much trouble. Great selection of skills, too few skill points. But hey, it's always like that, isn't it?<br><br><b>Playable 1 to 40, PvM</b><br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Alignment: Chaotic Neutral (any non-evil, non-lawful)<br><br>Attributes:<br><br>Starting<br>--------<br>14 Strength<br>12 Dexterity<br>12 Constitution<br>12 Intelligence<br>14 Wisdom<br>14 Charisma<br><br>Ending<br>------<br>26 Strength<br>12 Dexterity<br>12 Constitution<br>12 Intelligence<br>14 Wisdom<br>14 Charisma<br><br>Levels:<br><br>Guide<br>-----<br><br>1.

Nice goings, Finn. you forgot to include the class/lvl distribution in the topic, but Grip will fix.<br><br>A bit late BoE, but with his other availible powers it doesn't really matter. Gets okay saves, the choice between nice damage from 2 weapons or okay AC from shield. I liked the added bonus of Empowering the rangers Cats Grace. Nice. <br><br>All in all, buddy, a good, well-balanced character, which seems versatile and fun.

I had the honour to see the build before it got posted, and to discuss it with Finn in the middle of the night. Thumbs up on this one Finn. A pride for the Harper Scouts secret society.<br><br>A note for those who want to go plate, weapon and shield, drop starting DEX to 8 and pump CON and INT to 14. Also, just a few ranks in UMD gives the possibility to use any scroll in game IIRC.<br><br>Kudos to ya buddy!<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail
