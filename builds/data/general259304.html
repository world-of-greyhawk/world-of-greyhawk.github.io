This has probably been asked many times before but if someone could point me to the direction of this answer I would be grateful.<br><br>Since Rangers dont get the animal companion feat until lvl 6 is the companion meant to start at lvl 1 or 6? Do the druid/ranger lvls stack (capping at lvl 40) if both classes are taken?
