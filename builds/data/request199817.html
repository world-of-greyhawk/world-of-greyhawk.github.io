Having put a few thoughts into DDs and similar classes, I've been wondering about the relative viability of certain build set ups.<br>I'm not really asking to have a char built (I can do that too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ) but rather looking for input into which kind of build would be best to pursue:<br><br><br><b>Idea 1:</b><br>Fighter (or inserts any other class here) / DD / SD<br>Maybe 6 / 24 / 10 for high DR, and focussing on DEX and CON for Epic DR and Epic Dodge.<br>Might be taking more SD and less DD depending on needs<br><br>+Should have good AB (depending on base class)<br>+High DR<br>+Hard to hit (especially if someone casts improved invis on you)<br>+High HP<br>+HiPS<br><br>-Will likely be doing little damage as DEX based<br>-Questionable if Epic Dodge is worth it for a DD with high DR<br>-Likely using light armor<br>-Not specialized on one stat<br>-Will likely rely on a mage/cleric for buffs (most non-caster builds do though)<br><br>Might be a great blocker char that can take a lot of damage and block doorways and fiddle with the minds of his opponents.<br><br><br><b>Idea 2:</b><br><br>Wizard / DD / PM<br><br>Likely to be around 4 / 20 /16<br><br>+ Epic Spells (warding and mage armor) <i>possible right?</i><br>+ High DR<br>+ High HP<br>+ High AC<br>+ Can minorly buff<br><br>- Terrible AB (few attacks)<br>- Short lasting spells<br>- Likely weak against spells<br><br>Kind of like a True Dwarven Wall. You can hardly hit it and if you hit it, you'll do almost no damage at all, especially if speccing in CON and taking the Epic DR feats.<br><br><br><b>Idea 3:</b><br><br>Twillight Crossbowman<br>20 wizard / 15 Cleric / 5 SD<br><br>Note: on the server I play on, Tenser's transformation hasbeen modified that it gives wizards the full 4 attacks if their pre-epic levels are all wizard (also for sorceror) and that you have 100% ASF with tensered but you use the equip you actually wear and are not transformed.<br><br>+ 6 attacks a round<br>+ 5 of those at max AB<br>+ HiPS<br>+ Epic Spells (think so...)<br>+ Great variety of spells (arcane and divine)<br>+ Ultimate buffer<br><br>- Will likely hit +20AB hardcap quickly<br>- Low max AB reachable<br>- Low caster levels<br>- Specialized on both INT and WIS<br><br>The idea behind the build is to buff up as cleric, then wizard and tenser.<br>Being hasted via spell and taking rapid reload feat, you have 2 base attacks, +2 from tenser, +1 from haste, +1 from feat.<br>Likely also Zen Archery so as not to have to dump too many points into DEX.<br><br>Not sure though if this build would work.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>So...what do you guys and gals think about those builds?

I think you're miscounting the number of attacks you'd get with a crossbow for that last idea.  A character normally only gets 1 attack per round with a crossbow, regardless of how many attacks per round they normally get.  Contrary to what the manual says, Rapid Reload only gives you 1 extra attack period, and that's only if you have the BAB for it (which you do).  With haste, that gives you 3 attacks.  As for your modified tensor's...well, that would depend on how it was implemented.  If they made it like divine power, in that your pre-epic BAB goes up to 20 and you get any extra attacks you would deserve from that, then you wouldn't get any extra crossbow attacks, because a BAB 20 character with 4 normal attacks would sill only have 2 attacks with a crossbow with Rapid Reload.  If it's some other way where you are just given flat out bonus attacks like haste, well, that would be different.  So, at best 5 attacks, and at worst 3.  And knowing which of those it is speaks directly to your question of how viable that character is.<br><br>Steve<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 06/16/05 00:00</span></i></p>

Epic dodge is the icing on the cake in this case. Rather than the cake itself. This isnt primarly a SD but a DD build. It follows similar ideas. It just so happens to also qualify for Epic dodge so why not take it. And a little bit of min maxing (tumble) wouldnt go amiss either.<br><br>As a RP build its a little wierd, defensive stance and epic dodge seem to be contradictory feats. Defensive feats is certainly something it doesnt lack though.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

The thought was to build a build that was immune to critical hits, had good damage reduction, and could cast all the damage shield spells.  The problem was the almost complete lack of offense, CHA based paladins would mock this character for his AB, and the low caster level means his spells are ineffective.

To be honest; I'd think of cleric17/wiz21/rog2 instead.  All cleric levels before lvl20; start int17; wisdom18.<br>Spend one feat on GreatWis; and one point on wisdom.  All other attributes to Int; get at least 10 great int feats, and get some focus in one school if possible [not specialist](else get autostill and use plate for some melee possibility).<br>Epic UMD if possible, this opens you up to using other items from eg druid scrolls/wands for the fun stuff.<br><br>Using an Elf or Human will net no xp penalty before last three levels (rog levels at 38+39, xp penalty from lvl38); and you can even avoid that by not leveling up until you gather enough xp for the last three (if that applies).<br><br>What benefits:<br>All Cleric spells (major boosts + heal + greater restore ++)<br>All Mage spells; with a very good dc on attack.  Spell Penetration will pose a few problems but you have mord's and Epic Spell Penetration (3 feats for ESP) to help.<br>Major Buffs to the point that you can melee as well in a pinch<br>List goes on<br><br>Drawbacks:<br>Less power.  You'd get only two or so Epic Spells; Spell Resistance will be a problem (can be beaten but still a problem).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 06/20/05 13:49</span></i></p>

Hm... a few questions about that:<br><br>Taking rogue is nice, but none of the three classes have any discipline, so the char would be a really easy target for knockdown. any help on that?<br><br>Reflex saves are likely low, might need to work on that too.<br><br>Does specializing in a spellschool as a wizard also restrict these spells as a cleric?<br>so lets say you take illusion as wizard, would your cleric still be able to cast enchantments?<br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while

Try Cleric/Sorc/Bard or Pally instead.  You only have to increase CHA and WIS and clerics benefit from a high CHA (divine might and shield).  You'd get a lot more attribute synergy from this mix of classes.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.
