I posted this guy on the Epic Build thread and then it got closed.  I just wanted to stick it here in case someone is looking for a smiter to be able to kill any evil person with 1 critical smite.  I just copied my post from the previous thread where they were discussing the Divine Harper and the Death Hunter builds.<br><br>I added the name due to the way my guy looks with his Paladin only armor, so many people just refer to me as the Knight of Vor (my character runs around with a Vor symbol most of the time). <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>PREVIOUS POST BELOW:<br><br><br>First off, I'd like to say I really like the Divine Harper build too. Of all the smiting builds I've seen it is the most rounded and probably the easiest to play. I took two of CD's builds (Divine Harper and Damage Adept) and merged them into one to attempt to get the best of both builds. My goals were to do more damage on a smite critical than the Divine Harper, hit a smite critical often (unlike Damage Adept), and make it playable on the PW I play.<br><br>The PW I play has many evil people, and I wanted this guy to be able to kill a person with one critical smite. My damage goal was 1000 on a smite critical because the highest hp I typically see is 800-900. Although the Divine Harper gets around 800 I wanted 1000 for a one-hit-kill.<br><br>The end result was a very fun character that was not as well rounded as the Divine Harper (less STR and AC) but due to some STR items (only +5), it turned out very playable. I also discovered that many creatures and almost all bosses in the PW were evil.  <br><br>I know you don't put items in builds, but I wanted to list the items I knew I could obtain in my PW, in case someone else wants to build this guy on a PW, they may want to change some things slightly depending on their PW. I could achieve +5 to abilities and a keen Holy Avenger. The last item is most important, because I opted not to take any Paladin spells above level 3. If you cannot obtain a Holy Avenger then you will need to have Holy Sword spell (lv4). <br><br>I've had many people ask me for this build on the PW, so that's why I'm posting it along with my goals and items obtainable. People may choose to alter this one slightly to fit in the PW they play.<br><br>The biggest difference between this one and the Death Hunter and Divine Harper is in order to be a WM your starting stats have to be spread out more. You need 13 DEX (the other two builds have 8 ) and 13 INT for WM feats and 13 STR for Power Attack to allow for Divine Might. I chose not to worry about AC since I should destroy anything after 1-2 hits so I did not take Divine Shield. I also wanted blind fight because of the number of concealed people you meet in melee pvp. I had to leave off Epic Prowess and EWF (total of 3 AB) in order to get all the necessary CHA and Great Smites. He ends with a lower AB than the Divine Harper, but his AB is sufficient to hit most all foes. If you want EWF just drop one of the Great Smite feats. Each one drops your total smite critical by around 100 points. Like I said I wanted 1000 on one smite critical so in order to do that I built it as below.<br><br><br>Basically what I ended up with was a Pal23/WM7/COT10.<br><br>Human (Lawful Good - Of Course)<br><br>Starting Stats (End):<br>STR 13 (13)<br>DEX 13 (13)<br>CON 10 (10)<br>INT 13 (13)<br>WIS 11 (13)<br>CHA 16 (26)<br><br>Level Class Feat Ability Increase<br>1 Paladin Dodge, Weapon Focus - Scimitar<br>2 Paladin<br>3 Paladin Mobility<br>4 Paladin CHA(17)<br>5 Paladin<br>6 Paladin Expertise<br>7 Paladin<br>8 Paladin CHA(18)<br>9 Paladin Spring Attack<br>10 Paladin<br>11 Paladin<br>12 Paladin Whirlwind (Intimidate = 4) CHA(19)<br>13 Weapon Master<br>14 Weapon Master<br>15 Weapon Master Power Attack<br>16 Weapon Master CHA(20)<br>17 Weapon Master<br>18 Paladin Divine Might<br>19 Weapon Master<br>20 Weapon Master CHA(21)<br>21 Paladin Extra Smiting<br>22 Paladin<br>23 Paladin<br>24 Paladin Improved Critical CHA(22)<br>25 Paladin<br>26 Paladin<br>27 Paladin Great Charisma 1 (23)<br>28 Paladin CHA(24)<br>29 Paladin<br>30 COT Great Charisma 2 (25)<br>31 COT Great Smiting 1<br>32 COT WIS(12)<br>33 COT Great Smiting 2, Great Smiting 3<br>34 COT <br>35 COT Great Smiting 4<br>36 COT Great Smiting 5 WIS (13)<br>37 COT Great Smiting 6<br>38 COT<br>39 COT Blind Fight, Great Smiting 7<br>40 Paladin Great Smiting 8 CHA(26)<br><br><br>Final Skills:<br>Discipline 43<br>Taunt 43<br>Spot 42<br>Intimidate 4<br>Tumble 15<br>Leftover 6<br><br>Saves:<br>Fort 37<br>Ref 37<br>Will 34<br><br>Just a few more notes regarding this build. I don't like odd ability points, but this guy is filled with them due to WM requirements along with the CHA needed for smiting. I could obtain odd numbered items for ability help on the PW I play so it wasn't as big of a concern as obtaining 1000 on a critical and actually hitting a critical 50% of the time with a keen scimitar.<br><br>Some other items to note:<br>1. With Eagle's Splendor and Aura of Glory your CHA goes up to 32 easily without any items. This affects Divine Might and Wrath very much.<br><br>2. He still gets most the spells and feats that add damage (Greater Magic Weapon, Prayer, Bless Weapon, Divine Favor, Divine Might, Divine Wrath, Deafening Clang).<br><br>3. He does less on a regular smite than the Divine Harper. Harper around 400 and 800 on a critical. This guy around 335 on a regular smite, but 1000 on smite critical.<br><br>4. Scimitar is a 13-20 critical range with x3 multiplier due to Weaponmaster. If you can put keen on it you have 10-20 critical range so you will have the possibility of a critical hit 50% of the time. <br><br>5. Lay on Hands is very close to Divine Harper's. Unbuffed (CHA=26) same as Divine Harper but the Harper has 35 levels of Paladin/COT and this on is only 33 for a difference of 16 points.<br><br>6. There is not much room for changing the feats though due to the WM requirements and the Great Charisma feats needed to get to 25 quickly and enough Great Smiting feats to achieve 1000 on a critical. Like I said if you want to give up smiting damage then you can change the feats as you see fit. <br><br>Again, I'm not claiming this build is better than anyone else's, nor an Epic Build. It is VERY effective at killing evil quickly though and is very RP'able. It turned out to be a very fun character to play as well. There is just something about seeing the 4 digit number (1000+) going up over your head during a battle. <br><br>This guy was able to take out bosses 10x faster than anyone due to them being evil. I've had tons of ooc comments due to smiting somebody/something with this guy. It's always funny to get people's reaction when they see that 4 digit number. The last PvP I faced was actually a version of CD's exhaulted sorceress, and they didn't timestop me to death so I was able to hit them one time for 900+ and win. Don't get me wrong the exhaulted sorceress could beat this guy all the time, like any good mage should be able to do. The funny thing is many mages allow you to hit them knowing you will take 100+ damge from Acid Sheath, Elemental Shield, and Death Armor, but you have a surprise in for them if they are evil.  If you are evil aligned and this guy gets one melee strike off, you'd better beware!<br><br>Another thing to note about smiting. If people can obtain resistance to physical types of damage that make then near invulnerable anyways, they will still resist your smite damage as well. Smiting is counted as physical damage and not divine.

Just as one of my generally wacko ideas.. but why so much paladin.. you could drop it to 14 or 15 and get more CoT thus giving you the same amount of feats overall but an extra 2 or 3 to saving throws<br><br>-DaMouse

Some of the problems you run into are that COT gets bonus feats every 4 levels, not every 3 like the manual says.  They do not get Great Charisma as a bonus feat, only Great Wisdom.<br><br>Due to the fact you have to have CHA=25 to start taking Great Smiting feats the earliest I could take the first Great Smiting was lv31.  You could change the starting CHA from 16, but then you lose something else, you could take Great CHA 1 and 2 earlier than I did, or you could try taking Paladin only enough to qualify for COT, then use COT bonus feats to qualify for WM and get all the feats I took in epic that are available earlier, but I still think you will run into problems.  With a starting CHA=16 the earliest you can get to 25 is at level 27 which only leaves you 13 levels to squeeze in all the same feats that I needed.

Glad you found your answer.  I actually haven't checked this forum in quite a few days.<br><br>I have another version of this guy that is better for critical immune creatures, as in he does more base damage per hit on a smite.  I just haven't bothered posting it or anything.  If you're interested I could sometime.  PM me or post here.

You get the best natural AB progression, but without STR you suffer AB.  When I built this on a PW, I was able to rely on some STR items and +AB on my weapon.  <br><br>Thanks for the feedback though.  It's nice to see others are enjoying it.  I still log in with this character and play.  I love to see the 1000+ hits.  <br><br>I can give you the basics to another Smiter build I've done that does much more base damage on a smite, which is important for the critical immune creatures. It hits around 400/hit, but does not crit near as much.
