With a somewhat boosted dex, you could max it with items to make up for the FP base armor.  I would say Str and Dex are his primary attributes.  Wisdom would be a close 3rd for extra AC.<br><br>It's interesting as you can really use the extra speed to your advantage since this dwarf is an offensive powerhouse but lacking in the AC dept.  You will want to be darting in and out of combat with large groups of enemies and slaughtering foes 1 on 1.  In a party with a mage and cleric for support, you will meet no match.<br><br>Dual wielding with a jerkin allows you to keep your monk bonuses and having some extra dex boosting gear will give AC and improve your reflex save for Imp Evasion.  Of course, keep a shield handy for the extra AC in emergencies.<br><br>I meta-gamed this build quite a bit.(If that's even a word)  The AB is impressive, even when dual wielding.  <br><br><br>I came across several options when creating this stout, slicing, machine of death:<br><br>There is the option to replace Toughness with Great Dexterity - that's 40HP for +1AC and +1 reflex save.<br><br>You could focus on Warhammer and free up WP-Exotic.  Not a big difference between the two damage wise but dual waraxes is a sight to behold.<br><br>With the high AB, you're just begging to knock things down.  I chose to not sacrifice BAB and waited until level 29 for Imp Knockdown.<br><br>Have fun and suggestions always welcome!<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/" target="_blank">http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 12/26/05 15:58</span></i></p>

Another option I toyed with in the epic character builder was swapping Toughness and 2 Great Str feats for power attack, great cleave, and overwhelming critical adding 3d6 to the damage.<br><br>This drops the build by 40HP, 1 damage and 1AB but you gain an average 35 damage per crit.  I could crit for around 120 consistently but with OC I was around 150 with +5 axes.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/" target="_blank">http://www.dormaeglinunderdark.com/</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Talamier on 12/21/05 08:25</span></i></p>

I see.  Definately my mistake thanks fort he correction.  Never played a WM before so did not understand the WM feats.   Again this the excellent members of this guild help educate a fledging builder.  Thanks for correcting me.

Interesting build.<br><br>What about starting with one level of Monk for the boost in Skill points, but more imporantly, to have Cleave through the life of the build? You'd lose a point of AB but should help with leveling up.<br><br>And what about taking Two Weapon Fighting at level 9? Then Imp. TWF at 12? I think those are more valuable feats in this build than Improved Crit.<br><br>Nice concept, nice build.<br>_________________<br>Intelligent design is neither. Science over superstition please.
