Hello to all,<br><br>I've been reading in this forum quite a time but never posted any build - so here's my first then. Please forgive my bad english <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">  I looked for some similar builds but couldn't find any which go the same way like this (or I didn't find <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_redface.gif">  )<br><br><br>The Hitman<br>Dwarf<br>Rogue 3 / Fighter 12 / Assassin 25<br>Alignment: any evil<br>Playable 1-40 PvM<br><br>Str 15(22)<br>Dex 12<br>Con 16(22)<br>Wis 10<br>Int 14<br>Chr 10<br><br>1 Rogue1, Luck of Heroes<br>2 Fighter1, Weapon Focus: Longsword<br>3 Fighter2, Improved Initiative, Knockdown<br>4 Fighter3, Str16<br>5 Fighter4, Weapon Specialization<br>6 Rogue2, Blind Fight<br>7 Assassin1<br>8 Assassin2, Str17<br>9 Assassin3, Improved Knockdown<br>10 Assassin4<br>11 Assassin5<br>12 Fighter5, Str18, Toughness<br>13 Assassin6<br>14 Assassin7<br>15 Assassin8, Iron Will<br>16 Assassin9, Con17<br>17 Fighter6, Stealthy<br>18 Assassin10, Lightning Reflexes<br>19 Fighter7<br>20 Rogue3, Con18<br>21 Fighter8, EWF: Longsword, EWS: Longword<br>22 Assassin11<br>23 Assassin12<br>24 Assassin13, Con19, Great Constitution I<br>25 Assassin14, Superior Initiative<br>26 Fighter9<br>27 Assassin15, Great Constitution II<br>28 Fighter10, Con22, Epic Damage Reduction I<br>29 Fighter11<br>30 Fighter12, Epic Damage Reduction II, Epic Damage Reduction III<br>31 Assassin16<br>32 Assassin17, Str19<br>33 Assassin18, Great Strength I, Epic Reflexes<br>34 Assassin19<br>35 Assassin20<br>36 Assassin21, Str21, Epic Will<br>37 Assassin22, Epic Skill Focus: Move Silently<br>38 Assassin23<br>39 Assassin24, Epic Skill Focus: Hide<br>40 Assassin25, Str22<br><br><br>Death Attack DC: 37<br>15d6 Sneak Attack<br>AC: 19/30 Naked/Plate+shield<br>AB: 35<br>Hit Points: 568<br>Damage Reduction: 9/-<br><br><br>Fort: 26 (+8 vs Poison)<br>Will: 23 (+2 vs Spells)<br>Reflex: 30 (+2 vs Traps)<br><br><br>Skill Points = 258<br><br>Disable Trap: 18(20)<br>Discipline: 32(38)<br>Hide: 43(56)<br>Move Silently: 43(56)<br>Open Lock: 19(20)<br>Persuade: 9(9)<br>Search: 18(20)<br>Tumble: 40 (41)<br>UMD: 35(35)<br><br><br>Advantages:<br>- high hitpoints<br>- Damage Reduction<br>- Weapon Specialization/Epic Weapon Specialization<br>- Can stealth in full plate<br>- doesn't have to rely solely on a rogue-ish henchman<br>- spell-casting from scrolls<br><br>Disadvantages:<br>- low death attack DC<br>- sort of low strength but can easily be pushed by items<br>- somewhat weak will save<br>- no dual-wield<br>- no HiPS<br><br><br>Comments:<br>This guy is meant mainly for the OC's and will have probably some success in a PW which is not too difficult. Emphasis was taken on an assassin which can dish out the punishment to sneak-immunes too. Up to level 25/26 he should be as good an assassin can be but the four fighter level needed for DR lower somewhat his Death Attack DC.<br><br>Wis I left at 10 to give him a point on his weak will save and cha 10 is for the OC's conversation system which at cha8 gives one only reduced options.<br><br>Any comments are welcome <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

I'm not very proficient with sneakers, but I think taking Epic Skill Focus: Hide and Move Silently work for the very opposite reason of Epic Damage Reduction III.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

If you dropped the 6 con and 3 EDR, you could net 8 str and Epic Prowess...giving you 40 AB and a bit more damage.<br><br>This would delay EWS though.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Magical Master on 05/03/09 17:24</span></i></p>
