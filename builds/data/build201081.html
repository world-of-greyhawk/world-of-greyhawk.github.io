I was wanting to get wf unarmed much earlier, but couldn't see the forrest for the trees. I had a heck of a time as it was with trying to figure out the leveling selection. I even tried more CoT in pre-epic, but somehow ended up with less bab at 20, lol. So I went back to the format I used. I'm sure it had to do with the rule of 4's for rogue and Monk.

But you will have many encounters in which monsters don't die in the first round. And, unless something has changed, intitiative is rolled at the beginning of <i>each</i> round to determine who attacks first.  As your Dex increases, you'll begin to win these everytime, but there are still villains out there who are just as fast as you.<br><br> <!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Also what are your thoughts on the improved ki strike feats?

The point being the Ki Strike will help you to pierce high DR opponents, but you could do that just as easily with magic kamas, and still wear some nifty bracers or gloves or gauntlets.  <br><br>Also, it's not Wisdom that determines if you qualify for Ki Strike 4 and 5, but Monk level. For Ki Strike +4 you need to be 25th.  For +5 you need to be 30th.  You would have to make an entirely different build to get those, and even then I would tell you to pick up something different.  <br><br>To summarize, in a low to no-magic world, my guess is that Ki Strike could be King, especially if you made a Dex/Wis based 30Monk/10CoT and could also lay down some wicked Stunning Fists and or Quivering Palm.  In such a build, even if you started with a 15Wis and 16Dex, you could easily get a 32 Dex and 20Wis, a 42 natural AC, and a 40AB, with all CoT taken in Epic.  And saves that people would kill for.

Grizz, are you sure the WIS qualification isn't there for the Imp Ki Strike feats as well?

It was my understanding that the Attack Bonus on gloves also counts toward penetrating DR.  At least, that's what numerous posts and other people's tests have lead me to believe (mostly Mootiooze IIRC).
