Smite Evil AB boost depends on CHA, but the damage is dependent on the CoT (or Pally) levels. So I'd suggest SOR is not the optimal choice for a third class, but rather Paladin. CLC level 6 spells requires at least 11 CLC levels (I suggest 12 at least).<br><br>So, Perhaps CLC 12/CoT 26/PAL 2.Take 11 CLC and 2 Pally pre-epic. This will give you 6 CoT bonus feats for epic levels, which should allow you to get a lot of GRT CHA and some GRT Smite feats as well (IIRC, CoT can take Great Smite as a bonus feat).<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I had a good level 30 Paladin/Cleric/Rogue but I assume you are asking for a 40th level build, right?<br><br>But yes, if you want a smiter then you will definetly want Paladin in there rather than an Arcane class. Especially since you will most likely be wearing Armour due to low Dexterity. And if you want good Dexterity for a Smiter build, then I suggest you completely forget that idea, as it is not as powerful... possible, but not as powerful.<br><br>The guy above suggested 12th level Cleric. I think he would be right, as that would give you the 4th multiple of things like Greater Magic Weapon and the majority of other Weapon/Armour/Equipment buffs. However, if a +4 Weapon, and about 4AC don't matter to you in buffs, I would leave the Cleric at 11, as you need as many levels in Paladin/CoT as you can get, or your Smite will suffer quite a bit. Plus, if you get 15 levels in Paladin, you get the Holy Sword which is far better than a Cleric's Greater Magic Weapon. The only advantage of Greater Magic Weapon though, is that it's duration is Hour per Level rather than Round per Level... but IIRL the Paladin can cast Greater Magic Weapon in addition to his Holy Sword, so it doesn't matter except for the 3-5AC you will be missing out on.<br><br>You could also go to 15th Cleric level and get the full buffing potential out of those spells mentioned above, and get some higher level spells to boot. This, however, will make your Smite worse, though in turn, will make the build better overall, as you don't need to rely on an attack you only get 3 times a day.<br><br>To be honest though, I wouldn't even get Cleric levels. I would go Paladin/CoT/Weapon Master with proficiency in a Scimitar. Nail a boss for hundreds upon hundreds of damage and you are almost definetly sure to hit. With this build, on a Smite, you get one of the highest AB's in the game I think. Upwards of 80-ish, I think. Perhaps not the greatest out there, and it is a fair bit lower when not fighting evil, but if this build is designed to wipe out evil bosses, the Paladin/CoT/Weapon Master will do the trick. <br><br>If you are interested in the Weapon Master thing, I will find the build for you. It's somewhere... Kail likely has his version somewhere too.

Aww damnit. I don't know where the link to that build is. I figured it would be in the search engine or something. But nooooo. The search engine is STUPID!<br><br>I henceforth recomend that nobody uses it.<br><br>Kail, do you happen to still have a link or access to that Paladin/CoT/WM you made? I can't find mine but I am pretty sure they were the same, except you prefered a different weapon.

Thanks CD, yeah, that's my Paladin/WM smiter that Okembour was probably referring to. It's not in the search engine as many other builds, it seems that pulse cap has not yet updated it.<br><br>Actually, if a great smiter is needed I'd go for a Paladin 26/CoT 10/FTR 4 build getting Great Smite X like the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "245366", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>GrimSmiter</a>.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Looking for a realm of adventure?
