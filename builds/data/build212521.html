The is the first build I'll post since I got accepted into the guild. I had a brainwave sometime after reading this forums when christian.schnabel asked for an anti-assassin build. I know he wanted melee but here I present a wisdom-based monk-archer, which I hope is close enough since it's use pointy arrows to nuke the assassins and not primarily magic <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  . I think this build will do fairly decently against mages too.<br><br>WARNING: it's a very munchkinist build which utilises a lot of skill-point dumping.

Argh can't edit anymore but that Epic Weapon Focus: Lonwbow was taken as an AA bonus feat (the Char Build Calculator said I could) but I'm not entirely sure if that's legal.

Thanks guys <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  Glad you liked it.<br><br>I just checked the Epic AA Bonus Feats list and found that you could also take Epic Reflexes. That means you could drop two Great DEX and pick up Epic Reflexes and Epic Prowess as AA Bonus feats and one Great DEX to round up DEX to 14. That frees up one general feat slot which could be used for Armor Skin which I neglected or also drop Epic Skill Focus: Discipline which you suggested was unecessary and use the two feat slots for Great Wisdom.<br><br>With Armor Skin, Epic Prowess and only one Great DEX, he'll have one more AB and 2 more naked AC for 54 AB with a bow and 33 naked AC but one less Reflex save (now 29) and one less skill-modifier on DEX-based skills (Tumble).<br><br>With 2 more Great Wisdoms and that Epic Prowess, he'll end up with 55 AB with a bow, 32 naked AC (one less than above) and also a Reflex Save of 29. He'll gain another +1 natural modifier to his Wisdom-based Skills (Listen, Spot and Heal) but you'll lose that +10 skill modifier to Discipline. Maybe it's worth it - if they're close enough to disarm you or you're stunned, you're probably dead anyway. You might also wanna consider 2 more ability points into CON if you want to try this tweak for 40 more HP and one more fort save instead.<br><br>Also, I'm concerned about using Blind Fight. I've read somewhere that it doesn't work for ranged attacks. It's mainly there to cut the advantage of having SC. It'll be a pain if that doesn't work (and IMO unfair) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Jennalee on 09/13/05 23:17</span></i></p>

I am currently playing a close build to this.  Took only 1 wiz level.  I am currently at 23 (10 monk, 1 Wiz, 12 AA) and having great fun.  The run and shoot offense is the key, so tight spots provide some challenges.  A good tank in front makes this build a breeze to play.  Good luck.

Oh, forgot to ask:  Why take both spot and listen?  Don't both accomplish the same?  <br><br>In my build, I decided to max listen and save points for other things.  I found that when I play rogues/assasins, I sometimes quit dumping into MS to save points for other things relying on my hide skill.  I have since discovered many others I know do this as well. That gives the max listener an advantage.

HiPS is sooo abusable because Spot/Listen checks only happen once per round IIRC (patch this already!) and HiPS can be activated many times per round.

You can also quickslot your Stealth and Attack commands. (I've done this, putting them into the F1 and F2 slots), then just hit your Attack command and your Stealth command in quick succession. Once you get the timing right, you pop out of combat, HiPS, then attack and rarely ever do your opponents strike back.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Just curious, just reading this at work. But how much damage does this build do?<br><br>// Maniac_Mailman<br>_________________<br><i>"Omnes morimur et quasi aqua dilabimur in terram, qua non revertuntur..."</i><br>- Maniac_Mailman aka Nr|Five<br><br>Admin @ NWN BOTD Team PvP<br>Admin @ <a href="http://www.gameshrine.org" target="_blank">www.gameshrine.org</a><br><br>Member of the Epic Character Builders Guild

Mundane longbow, mundane arrows: 1d8 +14 (Crit. 19-20/x3).<br><br>I can post a more refined, AB/AC focussed version if you'd like (or you can ask someone else to). It's my first build here <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>.:\_/:.

Nah you dont have to, but I was looking for an Archer with decent saves and who uses Zen Archery (+ monk) for nice AC.<br><br>I'm going to use this on my Battle of the Dragons server, since the ac there will be easily 50+ and the AB will be insane. The spellcasters will have a hard time catching me also <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>So I'm very pleased with this build, will give more feedback after playing the build later today.<br><br>// Maniac_Mailman<br>_________________<br><i>"Omnes morimur et quasi aqua dilabimur in terram, qua non revertuntur..."</i><br>- Maniac_Mailman aka Nr|Five<br><br>Admin @ NWN BOTD Team PvP<br>Admin @ <a href="http://www.gameshrine.org" target="_blank">www.gameshrine.org</a><br><br>Member of the Epic Character Builders Guild

Character worked amazing... it was hard to touch with either spells or melee.<br><br>Two "annoying" things I have to figure out are:<br><br>- How to battle sneaks when you are pre-epic (those suckers get such a bonus pre-epic, but once I've reached Post Epic I have AC high enough to battle them)<br><br>- Damage is a bit low, but once you have the cash for arrows + bow, you can survive. (on my server everyone walks around with a greater archer belt, giving 10 piercing resistance)<br><br>But I really love your build, I will be playing this one a lot <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>Many thanks my friend.<br><br>// Maniac_Mailman<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Maniac_Mailman on 11/15/05 13:48</span></i></p>

Generally speaking, arcane archers tend to do poorly at pre-epic levels when compared to 20+ where archers starts to shine (or it could be just me). My best suggestion is to forget about this unless you play in a server which goes to level 30-40, otherwise a better way to fight sneakers imo would be to make a sneaker yourself, or a pm, or a bard with listen + amplify for the +20 mod. Probably other effective builds to use at lower levels, but those ones should do alright.<br><br>As for listen vs spot, listen seems to be better at catching the sneakers, but unlike spot it does not protect against going flat-footed. Sucks if you're getting HiPS'ed. It only gets one roll a round, whereas spot on an Elf works with keen senses as per description. Or so some veterans in two different forums say... never actually ran a test myself to find out.
