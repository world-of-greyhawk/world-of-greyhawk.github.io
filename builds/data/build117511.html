Well for a 39 Sorcerer/1 Paladin, this build was posted in the original thread I think, or I have picked it up from somewhere else.<br><br>Apologies to the person who came up with this. This isn't my original idea. Should help you out a lot though. I'll be giving it a try myself<br><br>Human Sorcerer - Lawful Good<br><br>Str 8 Dex 14 Con 14 Int 13 Wis 8 Cha 17<br><br>Pre-Epic feat progression:<br>1st: Combat Casting, Toughness (although I would have substituted Spell penetration myself if this character was played in a campaign up to 40th level, and taken toughness later).<br>3rd: Spell focus: Evocation<br>6th: Empower Spell<br>9th: Maximise Spell<br>12th: Expertise<br>15th: Greater Spell Focus: Evocation<br>18th: Spell Penetration (or Toughness...)<br><br>At 20th Level, take your 1 level of Paladin, and use this time to take any skills you want that you couldn't get as a sorcerer (perhaps discipline)<br><br>Regular Epic Feats: Great Charisma x 7<br>Epic level feats: Bonus for Sorcerer - Choose from these each bonus feat you get, restrictions applying;<br>Epic Spell Focus: Evocation, Epic Spell Penetration, Epic Spell: Improved Mage Armor, Epic Spell: Epic Warding, Improved Combat Casting, Epic Spell: Greater Ruin or Epic Toughness.<br><br>You might want to also take 3 Epic feats of Automatic Still spell, which will cover all your spells to level 9, meaning you can wear armour and carry a shield whilst casting them. Decisions decisions!<br><br>Spells to take:<br>IGMS, Black Blade of Disaster, Greater Sanctuary, Time Stop, Spell Mantle (An empowered lower level version, which turns out to be better), Elemental Shield &amp; Mestil's Acid Sheath, Improved Invisibility, Displacement, Ultravision + Darkness, Tensor's Transformation, Energy Buffer, Premonition/Stone Skin for best damage buff.<br><br>Best evocation spells for each level inlude:<br>Cone of Cold, Chain Lightning, Delayed Blast Fireball, Acid Arror and Nestil's Acid Breath, Bigby's line if you can fit them in.<br><br>Also definately take True Seeing and See Invis.<br><br>Hope that helps you out a little! I wouldn't mind seeing other peoples ideas on what to take for a pure spellcaster, or wizard.<br><br>Fenriswulf<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 02:31</span></i></p>

I was about to post a very similar build, but wanted to see if it already existed. <br><br>My build is a Sorc 36/Paladin 1/Monk 3 (for Monk speed)<br><br>The saves in this build are great if you're willing to forgo Strength and Constitution in favor of more Charisma. <br><br>To make up for lack of HP, I take Great Constitution IV. This boosts the fortitude save nicely.<br><br>The 3 Monk levels allow for Max Tumble, which is essential is almost all builds, I think. <br><br>But this certainly a fun and fairly good defensive build. <br>And he can cast IGMS 7 times per day! Hooray!
