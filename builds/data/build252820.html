Another template to milk the most out of 3 classes, and still be an extremely lethal character.  High hit points, Damage Reduction, Crit/Sneak Immunity, potent Damage Shields, Epic Warding and Spell DCs still high enough to make men shudder, this character should do well in all environements.  <br><br>_______<br><br><b>Mestil's Pale Emissary</b><br>    aka, <i>The Corrosive Incendiary</i><br><br>Wizard26/Palemaster10/Fighter4<br>Race: Gnome or Dwarf<br>Alignment: Any non-good<br>Playable 1-40, PvP or PvM, All Environments<br><br><b>Attributes</b><br>Str12<br>Int16 (32)<br>Wis8<br>Dex8<br>Con20 (22)<br>Chr6<br><br><b>Leveling Guide</b><br>1 Wizard, Extend Spell, Specialty School: Illusion<br>2 Wizard2<br>3 Wizard3, SF: Conjuration<br>4 Wizard4, Int17<br>5 Wizard5, Empower Spell<br>6 Wizard6, Toughness<br>7 Wizard7<br>8 Wizard8, Int18<br>9 Wizard9, GSF: Conjuration<br>10 Wizard10, SF: Necromancy<br>11 Wizard11<br>12 Wizard12, GSF: Necromancy, Int19<br>13 Wizard13<br>14 Wizard14<br>15 Wizard15, Maximize Spell, Spell Penetration<br>16 Wizard16, Int20<br>17 Wizard17<br>18 Wizard18, Greater Spell Penetration<br>19 Palemaster1<br>20 Palemaster2, Int21<br>21 Palemaster3, Great Int I<br>22 Palemaster4<br>23 Palemaster5<br>24 Palemaster6, Great Int II, Int24<br>25 Palemaster7<br>26 Palemaster8<br>27 Palemaster9, Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy<br>28 Palemaster10, Con21<br>29 Fighter1, EDR I<br>30 Fighter2, Great Int III, EDR II<br>31 Wizard19<br>32 Wizard20, Great Int IV, Int27<br>33 Wizard21, <i>Epic Warding</i><br>34 Wizard22<br>35 Wizard23, Great Int V<br>36 Wizard24, Great Int VI, Int30<br>37 Wizard25<br>38 Fighter3, <br>39 Fighter4, EDR III, Great Int VII<br>40 Wizard26, Great Int VIII, Con22<br><br><b>Vitals</b><br>AC: 15<br>AB: 21/16<br>HP: 502<br>DR: 9/-<br>Immunities: Crits/Sneaks/Stun/Paralysis<br>Spell Penetration: SRs of 31 or less are beaten 100% of the time.<br><br><b>Saves</b><br>Fort: 24 (36)<br>Will: 22 (34)<br>Reflex: 15 (27)<br><br><b>Skills:</b> 317<br>Concentration: 43 (49)<br>Discipline: 42 (43)<br>Heal: 43 (42)<br>Lore: 15 (26)<br>Listen: 32<br>Spellcraft: 43 (54)<br>Tumble: 0**<br>Craft Armor: 20 (31)<br>Craft Weapon: 20 (31)<br>*39 points remaining<br>**Tumble was not taken.

Palemaster was chosen for Crit/Sneak Immunity, and 4 Fighter levels were chosen for EDR since I felt it wasn't wise to always rely on Stoneskins/Premonitions.  AC is completely thrown out the window.  You want to be hit.  At the same time, 2 schools of magic were ESFed in order to give him variety, flexibility and potency.  <br><br><b>Arcane Strategies:</b><br>1. <i>Foci in Conjuration</i> was taken for Evards Black Tentacles and for some good Room sweeping spells like Acid Fog, Cloudkill, and also makes Summons somewhat harder to remove.  If Conjuration is not your thing, one can easily switch to Evocation without damaging the build.  Or you could go with Transmutation and use Flesh to Stone Spells with a pretty nasty DC.<br><br>2. <i>Foci in Necromancy</i> was taken for the obvious nice spell selection to deal with those with weaker Fort saves.<br><br>3. <i>Negative Energy Bursts</i> followed by Empowered EBTs.  In addition to the damage of NEBs, the strength loss is key here, as it may slow opponents down while making them more succeptible to failing the Grapple Checks coming from EBTs.<br><br>4. <i>Acid Fog/EBT:</i> Acid Fog inflicts 50% movement decrease with one of your better DCs.  Follow that up with EBT, or any damage dealing spell.  Grease will also work in a pinch in place of Acid Fog.<br><br>5. <i>Against Casters</i>: Flame Arrow to shred Mantles followed by Horrid Wilting, IGMS, Evards, etc.  <br><br>6. <i>Against tough melee opponents:</i> Until you acquire PM immunties, throw up Extended Damage Shields(Mestils/Elemental/Death), Greater Stoneskin/Premonition and/or Shapeshift into <i>Iron Golem</i>, and just wade into the fray.  They can't crit you, you'll have a ton of hit points, and you can let them beat themselves into a fiery-acidic death of bubbley goo.  Once you get PM immunities, then you can do away with Shapeshifting and wade in directly and still spellcast.  Between fairly high hitpoints, crit immunity and some DR, opponents will be taking 90 points of damage everytime they touch you.  Augment this further with Empowered Endurance and Con-boosting items to give your mage 700+ hit points.  Go even further by throwing up Death Armor so now you'll be dealing nearly 100 points of damage per hit upon you.  With your low AC, opponents should have no problem meeting their own Death Requirements.  You really won't be able to hit them, so you can cast BBoD which will have a decent enough AB to hit in low-magic environments.  Also, by 33rd level, you can cast Epic Warding and truly be impervious to pain.<br><br>7.  <i>Against Undead:</i> Empowered Undeath to Death should pretty much lay waste to all of them.<br><br>8. <i>Against Ranged opponents:</i> Bigbys followed by some huge damage spell should do the job.  Greater Sanc if you must to get a bead on them.<br>_______<br><br><br>A Search through the EBG did not reveal any Wizards similar with this class combination, as they were all spellswords and none attempted to be a caster.  Perhaps the closest was a 20Wiz/16PM/4CoT ( <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "142793", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Casting Tank</a> ) by Kreestopearq), but not as lethal, and more of an AC tank than anything.  I believe this bloke qualifies as a caster, and a pretty serious one at that.  Spell DCs are only 3 off from max possible.<br><br><br><i>Removed extra feat - Kail Pendragon</i><br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 10/14/07 13:36</span></i></p>

I wouldn't worry too much about the focus in Conjuration (or at least the loss of the one feat) with regard to the EBT spell. The save for EBT is only vs the paralysis effect of the tentacles. Even if they don't paralyze, they still can deal damage to anything in the AoE. So just toss Grease, Cloudkill, Cloud of Bewilderment, and any other spells that impede movement in the same area and watch the fun.<br><br>*edit* Nifty build, btw.

spells that are useful for a beater mage that grizz didn't mention.<br><br>1. slow!  yes you have a pack of angry dwarves on you and your heal kits aren't keeping your health up enough. epic warding is out.  slow them!  fewer attacks per round will allow you to heal a bit faster and hopefully kill them before they kill you.  neb is used in a similar fashion to reduce damage inflicted upon yourself.<br><br>2. bigby's grasping hand.  use this for anybody that has a melee weapon, but insists on casting spells instead of whacking on the poisonous mage.  grapple them and stand right next to them and they'll swing instead of casting spells at you.

The Scythe is more for show than anything else, from what I can see the possession of a Scythe is all that's missing from this build for it to be the Grim Reaper (nobody ever said the GR was a melee-type).<br> <br>As for the EDR, if you go Human you will need to swap 2 Int in Pre-Epic for Con. One of these can be picked up at level 40 by taking Int rather than Con for an overall loss of 1 Int without changing when you can get EDR.<br>_________________<br>N.O.M.A.N.<br>National Organisation of Matrimonial Attorneys Nationwide<br><br>"Let N.O.M.A.N. put asunder"

But this is a Dwarf template designed to get a High Constitution/EDR and a decent casting stat and some metamagic and spell foci.  If one goes Sorcerer, you have to invest 10 start up points just to get Charisma to 14.  Dwarves do not make for ideal sorcerers.    You also lose 4 feats going Sorcerer, you lose vast amounts of skill points, lose the ability to scribe scroll (which I find useful for making Spell Mantle scrolls so that I can spam those against enemy casters until they run out of firepower), and so on.  No, Wizard is clearly the best choice here.  I think one could make a variant using Sorcerer, and maybe taking Gnome, but it would look a bit different than this.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;and perhaps forsake the fighter for rogue or bard.. umd alone would probably be worth more than 3 epic dr feats (9 can usually be got from items) these epic feats could be put to better use.. more con?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --> I think you are asking for a different build at this point.  This guy doesn't need UMD.  And I and the rest of the guild try not to assume that we can get 9/DR from items (since I have yet to find such an item in any of my games).  <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;The usual reason for going a mage/fighter is the armour would it be a big loss?</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->I think you misunderstand the intent here.  He doesn't where armor.  He doesn't take Tumble.  He doesn't want AC.  He wants, needs, to be hit.  The Fighter is taken in quick succession in Epic to grab the EDR feats as fast as possible without having to sacrifice too much casting-wise.  While playing this character live, I found that I really liked those Fighter levels right up front at level 21-24 for instant damage absorption protection, and ended up postpoing the PM career a bit.  But it's all good.

This build really interests me right now.

What kind of demented mind would come up with a build like this. It is really quite sick. I always wanted to build an evil PM build but it would be several, or rather many, levels down on the evil side. <br><br>It is also quite nice that the build has both unique features and can also do well in all environments.
