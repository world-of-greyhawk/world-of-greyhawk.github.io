To complete the list<br><br><b>Purple Dragon Knight</b><br><br>Prerequisites: BAB +4, Mounted Combat, intimidate 1, listen 2, persuade 1, ride 2, spot 2.<br><br>Casting stat: Strength<br>Primary Saving Throw: Fortitude<br>BAB: +1/level<br>Skill Points: 2 + Int modifier<br>Class Skills: Craft Weapon, Craft Armor, Craft Trap, Discipline, Intimidate, Lore, Persuade, Ride<br><br><b>Level 1</b><br>Rallying Cry: +1 AB, +20% Movement Speed to all non-hostile creatures within 10m for 1 round (Usable 3x per day).<br><br>Heroic Shield: +4 dodge AC to one friendly creature (but not the caster) for one round (Infinite times per day)<br><br><b>Level 2</b><br>Inspire courage: +1 AB, +2 vs. mind spells to all non-hostile creatures within 10m for 10 rounds (PDK level/2 uses per day).<br><br><b>Level 3</b><br>Fear: Causes all targets in a medium area to become afraid for a number of rounds equal to the caster's character level if they fail a will save vs. fear with a DC of 10 + PDK levels + strength modifier of caster. (Usable once per day)<br><br><b>Level 4</b><br>Oath of wrath: +2 to attack, damage, saves, and skills of caster vs. a targeted non-friendly creature's race for a number of rounds equal to twice the PDK level. (Usable once per day).<br><br><b>Level 5</b><br>Final stand: 2d10 temporary hit points to a number of non-hostile creatures up to the charisma modifier + PDK level for a number of rounds equal to charisma modifier + PDK level. (Usable once per day).<br><br>---No further levels to the class---<br><br>Multiclassing tips:<br><br>High strength builds may find the fear spell handy when tackling many enemies.<br><br>The Purple dragon benefits provide a quick short term boosts to AB which may be quite useful to defensive builds allowing them to go on a short aggressive spree.<br><br>Classes with high APR can often make the most of PDK benefits.  Though the class is designed much more around aiding a party than going solo.<br><br>Disadvantages:<br><br>Although this is a party build it does little to help a solo caster's summon at level 40.  Besides the +1 AB from inspire courage, it is generally better if the caster concentrates on other things than aiding the summon for a round.<br><br>There are very few uses for PDK, especially in higher levels as high level abilities tend to outdo the short less effective buffs.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By WhiZard on 09/08/09 19:09</span></i></p>
