The lower lvl spells i dont remember so fast but you guys can figure those out i suppose.<br><br>Advantages: good saves and ac = good defenses.<br>Disadvantages: opponents with immunities or high saves (paladins, monk, champion of torms) can be a pain in the arse indeed but everyone can roll a 1.<br><br>GTG now await you replys<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 05/24/09 17:21</span></i></p>

Was in a hurry and hat no time to add some things.<br><br>Another good things is the SR of 41 you will be having as a lvl 29 druid. <br><br>If you wanted to up the dc of your stone hold and storm of vengeance spells you could drop the epic spells for 2 more GWs and drop 4 points in dex to up wisdom by 2.<br>Now your max dc (with +12 wisdom)is: 42 stone hold and 45 storm of vengeance. <br><br>You would lose 1 AC and your epic spells then though and im wondering if this is worth it.

And the reason for not taking DragonShape is? <br><br>Almost each and every Epic feat you take would be better spent if you took Dragonshape. Each to his own, but it's so powerful that when you can qualify like this, no reason NOT to take it. Hellball is mostly worthless for one.<br><br>*Edit* No weapon finesse or Zen archery makes you quite helpless when your spells run thin or you can't use them for harm.

Ah yes, I remember when I made a caster-focused Druid and didn't take dragon shape, everyone would ask why. In the end spells might work better, I made a few calculations and spells were far stronger, but playing the builds you'll notice the dragon's AC is just ludicrous on a Monk with that much Wisdom, it is worth it.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Well yeah i see your point grimnir. I knew i could have taken Dragon Shape but since this build is a caster i didnt really saw benefit in it as a caster. Ofcourse you could take DS for example instead of Hellbal.<br><br>Other thing: You wont lose your 1 AC when modifying your dex and wisdom as listed above. You would get 4 Wisdom and lose 4 Dex so there is no difference in end AC.<br>Only saves would be altered.
