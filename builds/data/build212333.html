Christian, I believe your PM levels will open up your level 6 slots for you, so you can metamagic your level 5 spells into those slots. Doesn't make a lot of difference, but I thought I'd mention it.<br><br>Nifty weapon choice.<br><br>I'd probably opt for the sickle for a couple reasons:<br><br>1) It's able to be keened with the Bard's Keen Edge spell.<br><br>2) It's really, really different.<br><br>Unfortunately, it wouldn't get the 1.5x STR bonus to damage like the spear does.<br><br>Interesting build.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

I'd add Ultravision to the spell list for those pesky Assassins casting Darkness. Not only a good anti-Assassin build looks like a decent all-round character too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

first of all, to Cinnabar Din.  that is what i thought as well, but when i tried leveling the character, i found that i only had level 5 spells.  i leveled this in the novice to epic char mod.  if someone else would try this and let me know, i would appreciate it.  i was hoping to get the 6th level spells, but for some reason it didn't seem to happen.  i considered using a sickle, but found that with the upped strength, i wanted to deal as much damage as possible.  but taking keen edge would have dropped another of my spells, all of which i kinda wanted to keep.  also, a naked ac of 30, more with armor, left me thinking that defense was adequate.  those facts in mind, if you wanna change some spell for keen edge, then sickle and shield becomes a very nice choice.  good advice Cin, as always.<br><br>to Amazon Queen.  you are right, again.  replace grease, with its mild usefulness, to ultravision.  i forgot about that little darkness thing.  with ultravision, you now neutralize another advantage assassins have.  good advice.<br><br>to Finneous PJ.  looking back, i think that you're idea is valid.  HPs is what this char needs.  later on, as you get more abilities and help from equipment, you are alright, but i think that a drop in saving throws, which are decent, is worth the extra HPs.  the real reason i took all of these saving throw boosting feats was to bump my fort save as high as possible until i become immune to death attack.  with that in mind, i think that i should replace Epic Fortitude with something else.  Armor Skin, Epic Will, Epic Skill Focus: Listen/Discipline, or even Epic Toughness would all be good choices.  thanks for the advice.  can never have enough HP for a melee char, even with a nice AC and concealment/DR spells.<br><br>thanks to all for their advice.  any further comments are always welcome.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"You cannot pass!"

The other thing that might be worth considering since this isn't a sneaky character and has a pretty decent AC is dropping DEX to 10, increasing CON to 14, taking Heavy Armour Proficiency and netting +80 HP that way.<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

Apologies Christian, my bad. You need at least 16 Bard levels to open up the level 6 slots. I was thinking the build was 16 Bard instead of 14. Sorry about that.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

It's just that casters that can't learn from scrolls never get the chance to choose the spells to fill out those levels.  Even if you take a level of sorcerer or bard later on, the game will still only look at your sorc/bard levels in terms of how many new spells you learn during leveling and what levels they come from.  So you'll never be able to learn 6th level spells without 16 levels of bard.<br><br>However, what I am not sure of is if you can still metamagic lower level spells into the spell slots you earn from PM levels.  So, even though you don't have 6th level spells, you could fill those slots with metamagic versions of lower level spells.  It would seem to me like it should work, as you should have the spell slots even if you don't have the spells themselves.  But then again, there are a lot of things should work but don't, and I've never made a PM myself so I can't say for sure.  The one thing I am positive of is that you definitely cannot learn 6th level spells if your bard (or sorcerer) levels are insufficient for them.<br><br>Steve<br><br>Edit: Oh, and just a minor point of information.  I've seen a number of people refer to the "scribe scroll" ability as the ability that lets wizards learn from scrolls.  That's actually the opposite of what it is.  Scribe Scroll is an ability all casters have (get the feat for free at level 1), which allows them to take spells that they know and turn them into a scroll (at an XP and gold cost), not the other way around.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Stravinsky00 on 09/13/05 19:51</span></i></p>
