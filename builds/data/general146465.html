Author My character builds update. <br>TyrPaladin <br><br>Joined: 15 Aug 2003 Profile: Saturday, 07 August 2004 04:13AM <br>New Ultimate Archer<br><br>- I got a kick out of this build and it hardly ever missed. I pissed a lot characters off because I never missed. (Well almost.)<br><br>- I got hit by a few character who had blind fighting, but most didn't take the feat so they SC 40% and high AC, keep them from hitting me all the time. In fact, getting hit was almost rare.<br><br><br>Disciplined Knight<br><br>- She did 62 damage without devastating critical nor enhanced weapons and land quite a few criticals.<br><br>- Did little to no damage from REF attacks in PvP and she did evade mind affecting attacks pretty good too.<br><br>- Lasted for a long and had a lot mage's running for their money.<br><br><br>Puck the Adventurer<br><br>- Weeded out traps and I end up with 18 Strong traps in my inventory.<br><br>- With UMD, he could wield almost any item and was own mage &amp; cleric.<br><br>- His nigh 100 damage sneak and 16 weapon damage made fights real short.<br><br>- I found throwing darts very useful than a using a bow.<br><br>- Other Players had a hard time hitting me while using SC 50%<br><br><br>Avatar of Torm<br><br>- As I suspected, it did a 400 something smite on a Lich (Ouch!) in the monster arena.<br><br>- Had a friend do Harm and a moment later I used Lay on Hands while using Aura of Glory and Eagle's Splendor and recover my life in full.<br><br>- Though it was made for PvP, it did some good damage against opponents in straight up melees when buffed.<br><br><br>As for the Battle Archer, though I built it in a arena server, I couldn't test it out since it was made more for PnP than PvP.<br>Edited By TyrPaladin on 08/07/04 04:22:55<br>   *    *   *    *    *    *    *    *    *<br>             <br>realm of shadow <br><br>Joined: 08 Dec 2002 Profile: Saturday, 07 August 2004 05:00AM <br>And only 5 mistaks on each build!
