If you can get a Keen Battleaxe your critical range would be (16 - 20 / x4) which will give you lots of criticals and high damage.<br><br><b>Why did I take 8 on Charisma instead of 6 and use the stat points somewhere else?</b><br>The reason I put Charisma at 8 instead of 6 was so I could use magical items earlier in the build.  Use a Eagle Splendor and grab a Nymph Cloak early in the build and you will be able to use scrolls with an Innate Level of 4. Scrolls like Greater Magic Weapon, Keen Edge, Flame Weapon, Death Armor, Elemental Shield, Mestil's Acid Sheath, Improved Invisibility, etc.<br><br>If you see anyway to improve upon this build, please let me know.<br><br>Edited Spelling<br><br>***** ***** ***** **** ***** *****<br><i>griphook ..Corrected a few typo's</i><br>_________________<br>The situation doesn't matter...

He doesn't have 8 CHA, but he wrote 6 in starting stats. Ending stats indicate 8 CHA instead.<br><br>I'd go for 6 CHA personally, and pump INT and DEX both to 14 (+43 skill points and +1 ref saves, no AC bonus since you'll be wearing plate) and also I'd drop STR to 17 and put CON at 15, then in epic switch dev crit with epic prowess and afterwards get either a great CON instead of a great STR or a CON bump instead of a STR bump for final stats: STR 32 CON 16<br>-1 AB/DMG and later dev crit but +80 HPs and +2 For save<br><br>With more INT and therefore more skillpoints you could even choose to move Rogue in epic to get back the AB you lose from dropping final STR by 2 points. You get a tumble bump in midcareer and +1 AB at the cost of 24 skillpoints.

Oh, righty, I forgot to add the Dwarf bonus to Con when checking the stats. Well, I'd drop Charisma to 6 anyhow.<br>_________________<br>Surely, without war there would be no loss - hence, no mourning, no grief, no pain, no misery...
