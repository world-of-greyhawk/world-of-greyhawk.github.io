<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM Build</b><br>....<b>( Duel Shortsword )</b><br><br><br>I looked through the list of builds but don't think I saw a fighter/rogue that used Champion of Torm in place of the Fighter levels. Hopefully this build will inspire others or at least open their eyes to this alternative. And of course, the third class need not be Wizard. It could be Shadow Dancer, Assassin, Weapon Master, etc, etc. The main point I'd like people to walk away with is the idea of using CoT to avoid an experience penalty. This is especially important in high-dex builds (Epic Dodge &amp; SC V cough*Syrath*cough <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">   ) where the build favors elf over human (but may draw an experience penalty if Fighter is used).<br><br>Having said all of that, here is my Elven Champion Spellsword. Feedback, criticism, and constructive suggestions all are welcome.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kaliban<br><br><i>Credits: I have to give partial credit to Diesel Vin Diesel (Versatile Spellsword build) and Mithdradates (Ferromancer build) for their unknowing assistance with this build. Cinnabar Din also gets partial credit since he was a participant in a thread developing a Rogue/Fighter/Shadow Dancer that ended up being a Rogue/Champion of Torm/Shadow Dancer. From that discussion I decided to use CoT for the martial abilities rather than Fighter in my elven spellsword build. This permits me to focus on an elven rogue yet get good melee capabilities and not have to worry about experience penalties. If I recall correctly, Syrath also piped in pointing out that using Fighter only brought weapon specialization to such a build, while CoT gives bonuses to all saves. Syrath also has persuaded me that dual-wielding kukris does not produce a huge benefit over shortswords.</i><br><br>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::<br><br>Race: Elf<br>Alignment: Good<br><br>Stats - Start (Finish)<br>Str - 12<br>Dex – 18 (28)<br>Con - 12<br>Int - 1 <br>Wis - 8<br>Cha - 8<br><br><br>1 - Rogue 1 - Dodge<br>2 - Rogue 2<br>3 - Rogue 3 - Wpn Finesse<br>4 - Rogue 4<br>5 - Rogue 5<br>6 - Rogue 6 - Wpn Focus: Shortsword<br>7 - Rogue 7<br>8 - Rogue 8<br>9 - Rogue 9 - Ambidexterity<br>10 - Rogue 10 - Imp.
