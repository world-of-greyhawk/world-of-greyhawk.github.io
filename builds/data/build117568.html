Hi I have a concept, one that I am trialling manually as we speak.<br><br>It is as Follows:<br><br>Elf<br>Rogue(13), Shadowdance(2), Weapon Master (1)<br>with the intention of becoming Rogue(13), Shadowdancer(20), Weapon Master(7).<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 20<br>Con 8<br>Wis 8<br>Int 14<br>Cha 10<br><br>The reason for the stats is twofold to get the weapon master reqs. and to keep the negative off Cha although you could swap Cha and Wis around if you feel the need is mostly cosmetic. The +1 to will saves is handy but so too is having the better haggle price... take your pic, roleplay or powerplay on that score.<br><br>Skills of Note:<br>Open Lock(18), Search(10), Disarm trap(18), Heal(max), Appraise(10), Tumble(max), UMD(15), Persuade(10), Hide(max), Move Silently(max), Lore(whatever is left)... ensure Intimidate of four is taken at 1st level for prereqs.<br><br>N.B. I have not listed the bonus feats, as they are automatically added it seemed somewhat redundant.<br>Level Class/Feats/ATTs.<br>1 Rogue/ Dodge<br>2 Rogue(2)<br>3 Rogue(3)/ Mobility<br>4 Rogue(4)/Dex(21)<br>5 Rogue(5)<br>6 Rogue(6)/Spring Attack<br>7 Rogue(7)<br>8 Shadow/Dex(22)<br>9 Shadow(2)/Weapon Focus(rapier)<br>10 Rogue(8)<br>11 Rogue(9)<br>12 Rogue(10)/Slippery Mind, Whirlwind Att., Dex(20)<br>13 Rogue(11)<br>14 Rogue(12)<br>15 Rogue(13)/Imp. evasion, Expertise<br>16 Weapon/Dex(23)<br>(where I am currently)<br>17 Weapon(2)<br>18 Weapon(3)/Imp. Critical(rapier)<br>19 Weapon(4)<br>20 Weapon(5)/Dex(24)<br>21 Weapon(6)/Imp. Whilwind Att<br>22 Weapon(7)<br>23 Shadow(3)<br>24 Shadow(4)/Weapon Finesse,Dex(25)<br>25 Shadow(5)<br>26 Shadow(6)<br>27 Shadow(7)/Great DexI Dex(26)<br>28 Shadow(8)/Dex(27)<br>29 Shadow(9)<br>30 Shadow(10)/Great DexII Dex(28)<br>31 Shadow(11)<br>32 Shadow(12)/Dex(29)<br>33 Shadow(13)/Great DexIII Dex(30), Epic S.Lord<br>34 Shadow(14)<br>35 Shadow(15)<br>36 Shadow(16)/S.Conceal I/II Dex(31)<br>37 Shadow(17)<br>38 Shadow(18)<br>39 Shadow(19)/S.Conceal III/IV<br>40 Shadow(20)/Dex(32)<br><br>Cheers any feedback on this build let me know... attempted a fairly strong combat char that does not solely rely on sneak attack or crits(as WM levels help round combat ability out) and made him harder to hit with conceal.<br>_________________<br>Character creation is a matter of style. When creating a character one should always strive for effect or image.<br><br>The smart player knows that every image is flawed and acknowledges this as part of the character that adds to its charm.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 02:50</span></i></p>

Great build, but one thing I might add... You cannot take whirlwind attack BEFORE you take expertise... In the build, i would switch the positions of the WF:rapier, and the expertise... nothing else changes in the build because of this...<br><br>I would also take rogue at level 40 instead of another SD level... This is because of the skills, in this case you can better max skills that would help in PW/PvP environments (UMD, Set Traps)... I also dont know of any SD perks from getting to level 20 in the class, so I dont think it would cripple the build at all... tell me if im wrong.<br><br>Also, in place of Improved Dexterity III, I would take EWF:rapier instead... While testing the leveling of the build i discovered that there was a slight miscalculation on the build, and you can actually get 30 dexterity at the same level WITHOUT getting ImpDex3...<br><br>For the AB if anyone was wondering, i got +40/+35/+30 with no gear except for a mundane rapier... With a +10 dexterity bonus, and a rapier +7, i got a +53/+48/+43 AB... With the correct gear (+10) I was able to get an AC of 64... (Note that these stats all are derived with EWF included, without EWF the dexterity would be an odd number [33], and no extra bonus would be given, 2 AB would be lost due to the lack of the EWF feat)<br><br>Because of the lack of a better place for Weapon Finesse (I tried to put it in an earlier level, it didnt work), it might be to your benefit to use a bow in the earlier levels.<br><br>There are 3 attacks per round, 4 with haste... Damage is kind of low without a sneak attack... Try to get some +STR gear to compensate.<br><br>Excellent build, overall... Im sorry if it seemed like I slaughtered your build, but to tell you the truth, the problems aren't major at all, considering the use of scrolls and SC4... Great job! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

I think it would be better to replace Epic Shadowlord with Epic Dodge.

Nicely said griz.  <br><br>It is a pet peev of mine to have people come and mak suggestions on a build that is older than their parents!  I hope people realize that, while their suggestions are correct for today, four years ago, nwn was different.<br><br>If you dont understand what im saying, try taking Epic dodge in a build BEFORE lv 27, which was very common place for elf and halfer builds just before the last patch came out.  Today, its impossible (if you updated).<br><br>In short, LOOK at the date of the OP before you post.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

Well it takes time to put these builds together. Builders like feedback. At least somebody responded to the build. All be it fours years late. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

Just so the new ones are aware, and I am not sure exactly how this guild started, but i can piece together from bein around so long.  It seems that the first guild members posted others builds here, billb0 being a name that is synonomous with some of the first builds posted to this guild.  SO, while Drav is correct, it can be assumed that Shadowlure (the OP of this build) had enough comments on the original post that he did, and billb0 simply posted it here for our early builders' reference.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 06/28/06 00:22:49 (GMT) -- TyrTemplar<br><br>This post is for general information purposes only, and does not constitute a legal opinion or render any legal advice.
