I'm pretty familiar with Artemis and seems to me that a Rogue/Fighter/Assassin combo would suit him better. Ofcourse, it is all in how one personally views a character when dealing with these topics. I have just never seen an Artemis build with Barbarian used, especially so many levels. <br><br>Seems to me that he is known as a master Assassin, so more levels in Assassin would be a must. If you still want Epic Dodge you could go Rogue 13/Fighter 4, 6 or 8 (depending on what feats you would want)/Assassin 19, 21 or 23. If you dont care about having Epic Dodge and want more Assassin levels you could go Rogue 2 (gotta atleast have Evasion)/Fighter 8 or 10/Assassin 28 or 30. <br><br>Overall, the build is interesting, but here is my biggest problem with the build... Your inspiration for the build is to play a character that resembles Artemis Entreri, correct? Yet the first 20 levels of the build are ALL Barbarian! That means no Hide/Move Silently for the great Assassin until level 21? No Death Attack damage until level 31? You are ok with this? <br><br>If you are dead set on having Barbarian levels, I would keep them to a minimum. I would also drop Shadowdancer for Rogue to gain earlier hide/move silently skills and access to the Assassin prestige class a lot sooner as well.

well, i build chars for level 40, i do not really care what he is like till 40, as for barbarian, i just finished reading Road to the Patriarch, and he well he is incredibly angry in that one, recklessly so, and  i wanted the DR/hp XD<br><br>The other reason for 20 barb levels,  is i dont know how to max out BAB pre epic without the easy classes (fighter, barb ect) i know he is a master assassin, but in the books, he spends most of his time toe to toe with his enemies, and i wanted someone who could do that, but could still sneak...

He is a cold, calculating warrior, often facing his victims face to face.

See, it says in description that the build is BUILT for 1-40, pvm.  IF you are building for 40 birth, then it should be stated in bold above so as not to confuse the new player that builds your build and cant figure out why he is getting smoked at certain lvls!  btw, i cant see why that would happen with your build.  It is barb20 which is TOUGH! Nicely done.<br><br>I am struggling to understand what you mean by Easy classes, and maxing bab?  If the class is a fighter class (cot, bg, etc) then your bab is still 1/lv to 20.  In my 6 years of nwn, i have never found non-prc classes to be EASY!  I think, at the end of it all, i have just gotten to the point of understanding of the cleric class!  but im slow <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/24/06 22:47:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>You should listen to avado <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->
