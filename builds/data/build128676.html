This is nice but IMO the Bard 23/RDD 10/WM 7 is much better. All those Fighter Feats aren't really needed IMO, and the Level 23 Bard Song plus spellcasting is really good, and the WM crits are awesome.

I agree on fighter build being better overall too.<br><br>As a suggestion, a variant of bard 20 / fighter 10 / RDD 10. Could lose three feats (Lingering Song, Skill Focus: Taunt, Epic Skill Focus: Taunt) in favour of Lasting Inspiration. In most cases 100-round lasting songs would give far more benefit, though I guess it depends on where are you going to play it.

I just made this build to test out my training module, and I found a couple of bugs (I left out some attribute bonuses and didn't calculate the skillpoints correctly). Good news is with the corrections the build is much stronger.  When I put through my training module he just slaughtered everything... Well here he is with the corrections.<br><br><i>Advantages</i><br>-With Taunt and Curse Song he can lower an opponent's AC by 11 points.

Well almost done the Hordes campaign with this build.  It's quite an easy walk with the character, in some ways a little too easy.  It's strong from lvl 15.  The whole campaign so far has been more hack'n'slash.  Theres no real need to buff and I found myself play a diablo like style of play which was kinda fun after doing the Shadows expansion with a rogue.<br><br>I just did the fight with Grim, Mag etc in Chapter 3, didn't know it was coming (first time through), walked into the room unbuffed, half health.  Used one heal potion, one mob went down to DC.  Deekin and Albeith had almost killed the minotaur by themselves but I had to finish that too.<br><br>Fun FUn Fun

So, a +12 to STR and True strike is good for a +26 to your base AB, (45+26=71 in this case).  Throw in a curse song and a taunt on your opponent (which could potentially lower his AC by 11 points) and that's equivalent to an 82 AB.  Anyway, the best way to cast true strike is to hire a mage to make a wand of it for you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> .<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Alright, I play on PvP servers, and I've been looking for a decent Bard build that could be both offensive and a good support character. However, I despise Devestating Critical, to the point of not wanting to take it (which is a huge hinderance, considering others take it and slaughter me anyway).<br><br>Anyway, the point of this is...would it be possible to switch this build up from a Strength-based character to a Dex-based? Switch to Robes, still use a greatsword, that way you could also cast spells without hinderance, as well as having greater AC (I would think?). Since I don't want Devestating Crit, it doesn't bother me that I wouldn't have it anymore, but I suppose perhaps the strength damage bonus would hurt a bit.<br><br>Any idea if the build would be completely ruined by doing something like that?
