I would take all skills from pickpocket and throw them into set trap, and get trap mastery if you can!!!<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Interesting. I'd definitely take KD over Disarm - way easier to generate sneaks that way.<br><br>Also, I don't know if I'd call any Rogue 'Iconic' without the ability to find, set, and disarm all traps and take on almost any lock. I'd drop either Spot or Listen as well as Heal, and put those points into Search, Set, Open Lock, and Disarm. I'd also drop Blinding Speed and/or SA II in favor of an Epic Skill focus (or 2), or perhaps Skill Mastery.<br><br>With your DEX and INT as well as the +2 synergy bonus from the two skills, you'd need 35 points in Set Trap and 34 in Disarm (add 10 if you want to be able to recover Epic traps) to handle any trap in the game. I'd also max Open Lock and get my Search to at least 19, allowing you to automatically detect traps up to Deadly classification. Ideally, I'd have 40 points in Search to automatically detect Epic traps as well.<br><br>You can also save yourself 6 skill points by dropping Spellcraft to 18 (with your INT bonus, that gives you +4 to saves vs spells, same as you currently have with the 21 ranks).<br><br>So, to summarize, I'd:<br><br>Drop Heal and Spot (or Listen)<br>Drop Blinding Speed and/or SA III<br><br>Raise Search to 19 (or 40).<br>Max Open Lock.<br>Raise Set Trap to 35.<br>Raise Disarm to 34 (or 39 + Epic Skill Focus + Skill Focus or some other combination to get to a total of 68 with the take 20 skill, in order to recover Epic traps)<br>Pick up Skill Mastery and/or an Epic Skill Focus feat.<br>_________________<br>Captain's Log, Stardate 6051: had trouble sleeping last night... my hiatal hernia is acting up.

Cin hit on just about everything I was thinking.  The main thing to me is that if you are truly an Iconic Rogue, you should be able to open any lock and disarm and set any trap, to including during combat.  A legendary rogue, should be able to set traps up on the fly so to speak, or to open locks under pressure.  I would also definately go the kd route vs. disarm.  At least if you do manage to kd your opponent, you will generate sneak opportunities.  <br><br>Good idea on walking the line between strength and dex, btw.  This way, you can still do somewhat of some damage if you cant land a sneak attack, and are forced to fight straight up against an opponent.  You also get xtra credit from me for going dwarf, and getting the extra hp and other bonuses <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.

Like the build too, but an "iconic" rogue for me would go dex straight and probably strive for SC 5.<br>And fully agreed on the other comments already made <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">

I wouldn't have doubted that you like the race of this one griz <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>TBH i built the rogue with the PW environment in mind which is why i upped heal quite a bit (for healkits) and took spellcraft to 21 (as i could drink an eagles potion or similar for an extra +1) though this case is arguable for dropping a lot of points.<br><br>I considered epic skill foci as well, mainly in hide/ms but without a SD level, that seems like a waste. I agree that some points could be put into the trap skills to bolster those more while openlock is actually high enough.<br><br>For feats, SC V IMO is a waste when you got access to scrolls and it requires you to be nearly all out DEX based.<br>As noted, blinding speed can be replaced by something else if needed.<br>_________________<br>Inactive for a while
