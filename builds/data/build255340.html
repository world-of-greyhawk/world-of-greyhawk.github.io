The first character I played in Neverwinter Nights. At that time she was only Karna the Amazone, but as she developed into an epic bard she got the thousand tunes. She was originally a Fighter/Bard and served well under Lord Nasher in the quest to save Neverwinter. When Hords of the Underdark introduced the weapon master, she became one of them.<br><br>After that she has been played all the way to level 40, and this build is the final Karna after some back and forth. She has been redesigned in the pre-epic leveling order. She was also originally a longsword master, but I decided to change that to scimitar, because that made her even more lethal. The epic progression is how I felt she would develop best level by level when I played her.<br><br>There are a lot of Bard/Fighter/Weapon Master builds here, but only one other that goes epic bard <br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "249328", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Ruinous Raconteur /Bard 23/Fighter 10/WM 7</a> by Mithdradates. The two builds are quite different and both are very nice. RR goes for massive criticals with scythe, while Karna goes for as many criticals as possible with scimitar.

The spell buffs are not easy to dispel. Mordenkainen disjunction or a lucky roll with Greater dispelling is required. Spellcasting play is made easy with the still spell.

The key ability for Concentration is Constitution, so intelligent wizards won't be any better off than anybody else.<br><br>*edit* Oh, yeah, nice build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">     .<br><br>A couple things I'd change, though:<br><br>-Luck of Heroes is something to take if you don't have anything else to spend pre-epic feats on, and no WM build will ever have that problem.  I'd replace it with Knockdown, which is currently lacking.<br><br>-I've found that Bard spells are best used, in most cases, as pre-combat buffs, meaning you can just take your armor off to cast them.  This being the case, I prefer Extend Spell to Still Spell, even in str-based Bard builds.<br><br>-You're taking 21 Bard levels anyway, and you can take LI at Bard 20.  Why not take it a LOT earlier, since it's probably the most important feat in the build?<br><br>*edit 2* I see now on that last point that you're taking a lot of Bard in epic to preserve BAB, so I guess not a LOT earlier.  But still, you could delay your Fighter levels and take LI at 33, or 36 if you wanted early EWS, which would be, IMO, significantly better.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Nimueh_Leafbow on 10/11/06 05:37</span></i></p>
