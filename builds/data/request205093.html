Go druid the first 12 levels, with stats pumped into charisma and wisdom as far as you can plan for. take 25 cot levels, making sure to take great wisdom to qualify for the dragonshape feat and the 2 epic AB feats. Take 2 druid levels, maxing spellcraft. Take 1 monk level, maxing tumble, hide, move silent and discipline, chucking the rest into pick pockets for the time your foe will be dead on his back. Do this just right and you will be able to get your buffed AB up into the high 60's for a full minute....higher if you can find a hat, armor or shield that kicks up strength.....all thanks to divine wrath.
