Why dwarf? You are increasing your charisma with two anyways, so why not take human, gain an extra feat, and raise your constitution with two instead? Am I missing something?

I like Dwarfs. Also, there's the +2 on saves vs spells, and the various other class bonuses. You can certainly go with Human with this build, for the reasons you mentioned (and also end up with 43 more skill points). But, like I said, I like Dwarfs.<br>_________________<br>Where I'm playing now: <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk.</a>

This is actually a pretty slick build, all things considered.  PM immunities and epic warding are good mojo.<br><br>Dwarf is a fine choice due to their racial abilities and favored class - fighter.

Besides, CoT can't get WS, only EWS if you got WS beforehand with Fighter.<br><br>Dwarf is a great race (also because Dwarven Defender is my favorite class, and you need to be dwarf), but one of the general benefits is exchange CHA for CON, not precisely working here.<br><br>I would change DEX to 8 to increase CON to 16, but that's just me, you can buff with Cat's Grace to get the 12 and use Heavy armor, he looks like a melee to me, not high DEX enough to not use heavy, just take it off for buffing (might not work with Epic Warding right at the spot where you need it though...). Net +40 HP, and buffed DEX with Heavy armor no AC lost, probably one reflex save, depending on the Cat's Grace roll and on capping DEX.<br><br>EDIT:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;His saves are in the 'okay' category, but vs spells he should do alright.

Sweet build.  I love bards.<br><br>I'm actually playing a Bard 16 / CoT 8 / PM 16 on CWL right now that's very similar to this build, and I have one piece of commentary:  Epic Mage Armor is better than Epic Warding.  With 16 levels of PM, you're looking at a duration for EW of just over a minute and a half.  Maybe good if you're up against another melee fighter, but your AC is so high that fights like that are going to last a very long time anyway...by which time, EW will have run out.  Against mobs, it will run out after one encounter, and I don't think you want to rest and rebuff between every fight.<br><br>EMA, on the other hand, depending on the magic level of the server, will get you anywhere from +17 (doesn't stack with 3 of regular Mage Armor) to +5 AC (unless you're on some crazy server where you can max your dodge bonus, which I haven't been able to, even with +6 items and level 16 bard song).  That's a big jump, and it will last 16 game hours, which is basically forever, until you rest.<br><br>Also, there are enough good 1 round/level Bard buffs that I'd like to see Extend Spell somewhere in the build...perhaps at the expense of Extra Music; since you don't have Curse Song, I think 12 uses per day ought to be sufficient.<br><br>Finally, don't dismiss this sort of build's PvP potential.  The version I'm playing, after using Curse Song and Taunt, has AB comparable to pure melee builds, but about 10-15 higher AC.  The only people my level who beat me with any consistency at all are mages with huge damage return shields.<br><br>*edit* Oh, and I don't think you can take metamagic feats on fighter levels, even if you meet the prereqs, so unless I'm wrong, you should reshuffle the leveling order so you take bard at level 9 and get Still Spell as written.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Nimueh_Leafbow on 05/24/06 01:01</span></i></p>

Good points all.<br><br>Thax: I like IKD, but it's not the be-all-end-all.

Heh, be-all-end-all... but I don't find a fitting feat in exchange... someone could like Power Attack/Cleave instead of IKD and maybe a saves feat, lingering song or extra music... but I prefer feats as they are.<br><br>About my point in DEX.... really, what kind of armor you're using for him? because just that I think it's heavy doesn't makes it happen... fighter gives you heavy armor and shield proficiencies, so AC should be good.

Cinn: U know, you'd get much better stats, especially as a bard if you were human and not dwarf (that -2 hurts; need to boost it, which you do anyway, but those are two feats that could be opened i.e., epic will, epic fort . . . or,  . . . list is endless; . . . ; also, even though PM gets him extra spells per se after PM 10, wouldn't his low charisma thwart this?

Interesting feedback that has come on this build. As to the Human vs Dwarf, see my first response: I know Human has advantages, but I like Dwarfs and built this specifically as a Dwarf.<br><br>Xylo, for the 15 CHA, take note this build was posted almost a year ago. At that time, I was unclear on exactly how the PM and CHA-based casters worked, but my understanding was if the character had the CHA to support it, the higher level spell slots would be opened up for metamagic. It's been a long time since I've fiddled with this type of class combo, so I don't know if that would work or not, but IIRC, it won't. If you know for certain, please let me know. Otherwise, I may test it out when I get a chance.<br>_________________<br>Where I'm playing now: <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk.</a>

Oh, Cinn, it works like a charm. You just got to know how to pull it off. Welcome to the Grim Parlour of Charismatic Undead:<br><br>Right-click on the quickslot, and use the radial menu to get to metamagic, and voila, your meta'ed spells show up. I'm not sure, but I think you can do this by right-clicking on the spell-target too and picking it from there. That won't work well for multiplayer and no-pause scenarios, though.<br><br>I have built 2 CHA-based Palerunners on this guild, and they taught me how to play them. You're ready to leave the Parlour, bring my learnig to the people.<br><br>Rock on.<br>_________________<br>I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide.<br>I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb.<br><br>I run the <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "13568", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Pre-Epic Builders</a> guild. Join and share your experience.

Interesting behavior for the charisma-caster PMs Grim, 15 cha is probably worth it then, since you can use the 5th level spells to extend improved invisibility and war cry.<br><br>I don't build that many pale masters, but it will be something I keep in mind in case I decide to try one.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
