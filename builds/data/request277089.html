It sounds like Bards are powerful there, not only for the items but also for GMW.  Also, since +3 is the cap on AC items, how about a build with Epic Mage Armor as well?<br><br>A 20 Bard 4 Fighter 16 Palemaster comes to mind.  You could take all 4 Bard pre-epic to attain the 4th APR, 16th Palemaster at 39 for Epic Warding and Epic Mage Armor (the latter a bonus feat), and 20 Bard at 40 to maximize discipline etc.<br><br>It would attain about 53 AB IIRC when using a +5 weapon and maxed STR, which goes up fast when you calculate curse song and taunt.  Also, it hits for about 30 with a mundane weapon, so your bastard sword would certainly hurt some people. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>All in all, it dishes out damage, lowers opponents' stats, and is <i>very</i> hard to hit when you factor in high AC, critical immunity, and Epic Warding DR.<br><br>One last thing - is there critical immunity items granted there?  I'd assume not since Dev. Crit. is banned.

I'd probably make a Cleric 20 / Fighter 4 / Rogue 16 with Epic Dodge or the like, you'll be sneaking decently with your cool all elemental sword for sneak immunes (added GMW and Darkfire it will be even stronger), so I think it would work nicely, the DEX and Epic Dodge assure you won't get hit easily, Cleric/Rogue is very playable pre-epic at any rate, just try to get Epic Dodge soon, the only issue is you'll get XP penalty...<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 06/25/07 03:30</span></i></p>

Possible combinations that would do well in that environment, IMO:<br><br>Cleric 20, Bard 4, PM 16<br>Cleric 26, Bard 4, PM 10<br>Cleric 26, Bard 4, RDD 10<br>Paladin 20, Bard 4, PM 16<br>Paladin 26, Bard 4, PM 10<br>Paladin 26, Bard 4, RDD 10<br><br>Cleric 26, Monk 9, SD 5<br><br>Personally my characters have never been designed for PvP, so how they would fare is anyone's guess.<br><br>Looks an interesting mod anyway. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Mwhaha!  You could totally merge your sword into a shifter form.  The Risen Lord, Azer Chief, and epic humanoids all have +5 or better weapons.  Merge with the Azer Chief and you could get +5 Enhancement and have his +2d4 fire damage override your sword's pidly +1.  Anyway, it's definately a thought.<br><br>More appropriately, you will want a way to buff you weapon to +5 no matter what route you go.
