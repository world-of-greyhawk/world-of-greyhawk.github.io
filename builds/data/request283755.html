Alright! Here it goes againnnn! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>I'm looking for a good unarmed monk build, dexer preferabley. Dev crit monks are pretty awesome too, but, not reliable enough for me. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>I think you all know my siduation. <br>+5 Items<br>Lots of dev critting WMs with 62+ ABs<br>No PM or RDD<br>Epic Dodge would be nice<br>Self Conceal is also cool<br><br>Usually I'd say no caster, but I don't mind this time <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">   Cleric monks are supposed to be good and all...But...I don't like Kamas, and I hate it when you have to rely on buffs to win fights, and then people catch you off guard and unbuffed, and you're down. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  <br><br>Also! It's possible to get +8 Monk gloves on my server.<br><br>I've tried the usual 30 monk / 5 fighter / 5 SD, it was 'aight, but I didn't really like the AB and the AC wasn't fantastic. Maxing out Dex, Wis, and STR is hella annoying.<br><br>What do you suggest!?<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Endalyor on 09/24/07 20:06</span></i></p>

I'm currently playing an Elf Monk 20/ SD 5 / Assassin 15 with Epic Dodge.<br><br>He also has a Bone Golem skin which is pretty cool looking if you ask me.<br><br>I chose Assassin over Rogue, no xp hit, improved invis.<br><br>I like it.

Forget it Endalyor, besides, a DEX based heavy Monk, no kamas and no buffs? I'll never make such build, not my style, I don't think it will make a good build.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn

Well, I posted one, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "277908", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>here</a>.  You'd probably have to edit it a bit, so it didn't have an alignment shift, but for your environment it'd be a dandy.<br><br>Also, if you want a powerful monk that doesn't need to buff, try a Ranger with bane of enemies.  Gets about 58 AB with +5 gloves, average AC for a monk, and great damage.  You could try 23 Ranger 12 Monk 5 Shadowdancer, or 26 Ranger 9 Monk 5 SD (if you want Epic Dodge).  If not, you've a lot more possibilities.<br><br>Just remember, your Fortitude save won't be that great, probably caps at around 47, and it's not that easy to level up (no monk pre-epic).
