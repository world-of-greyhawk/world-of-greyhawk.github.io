This is a versatile melee build that I'm currently running on a PW with very good results.  I didn't find any builds with the same level split using the search engine as most favored more bard levels and one focused on the CoT.  As you probably have guessed, the level split is very common where Red Dragon Disciple was used in the place of Champion of Torm.  While this build doesn't have the raw power of a similar RDD build, I believe it does offer a bit more versatility by offering combat feats, magic feats, bardic goodies and Dev Crit.<br><br>Suggestions, questions, and criticisms welcome.<br><br><b>Blade Chanter</b><br>Bard(16), Fighter(14), Champion of Torm(10), Human<br>PvM 1-40, PvP untested<br><br>STR: 16 (30)<br>DEX: 8<br>CON: 14<br>WIS: 10<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 14 (16)<br><br>Human: (Quick to Master)<br>01: Bard(1): Toughness, Knockdown<br>02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br>03: Bard(2): Extra Music<br>04: Fighter(2): Str+1, Power Attack, (STR=17)<br>05: Fighter(3)<br>06: Fighter(4): Cleave, Weapon Specialization: Scimitar<br>07: Bard(3)<br>08: Bard(4): Str+1, (STR=18)<br>09: Bard(5): Curse Song<br>10: Champion of Torm(1)<br>11: Champion of Torm(2): Blind Fight<br>12: Bard(6): Str+1, Extend Spell, (STR=19)<br>13: Champion of Torm(3): {Smite Evil}<br>14: Champion of Torm(4): Improved Critical: Scimitar<br>15: Bard(7): Craft Wand<br>16: Champion of Torm(5): Cha+1, (CHA=15)<br>17: Bard(8)<br>18: Champion of Torm(6): Expertise, Improved Knockdown<br>19: Champion of Torm(7)<br>20: Champion of Torm(8): Str+1, Great Cleave, (STR=20)<br>21: Champion of Torm(9): Great Strength I, (STR=21)<br>22: Bard(9)<br>23: Bard(10)<br>24: Champion of Torm(10): Str+1, Great Strength II, Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar, (STR=23)<br>25: Fighter(5)<br>26: Bard(11)<br>27: Bard(12): Great Strength III, (STR=24)<br>28: Fighter(6): Str+1, Overwhelming Critical: Scimitar, (STR=25)<br>29: Fighter(7)<br>30: Fighter(8): Great Strength IV, Devastating Critical: Scimitar, (STR=26)<br>31: Bard(13)<br>32: Bard(14): Cha+1, (CHA=16)<br>33: Bard(15): Lingering Song<br>34: Fighter(9)<br>35: Fighter(10): Epic Weapon Specialization: Scimitar<br>36: Fighter(11): Str+1, Great Strength V, (STR=28)<br>37: Bard(16)<br>38: Fighter(12): Epic Prowess<br>39: Fighter(13): Great Strength VI, (STR=29)<br>40: Fighter(14): Str+1, Armor Skin, (STR=30)<br><br>Hitpoints: 456<br>Skillpoints: 253<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 29/24/27<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8<br>BAB: 28<br>AB (max, naked): 42 (melee), 28 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 19/30<br>Spell Casting: Bard(6)<br>Alignment Changes: 0<br><br>Disable Trap 1(3), Discipline 43(53), Open Lock 1(0), Perform 27(30), Spellcraft 38(40), Taunt 40(43), Tumble 40(39), UMD 40(43), remaining skillpoints 21<br><br>Some quick AB calculations:<br>AB Calcs	<br>42	Base<br>+2	Bard Song (+2 to AB)<br>+5	Curse Song (-5 to AC)<br>+6	Taunt<br>+2	Bull's Strength<br>+5	Greater Magic Weapon<br>+2	War Cry<br><b>64	Buffed</b><br><br>Similar builds:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "242348", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Ode to a Lily (Brd 26 / Fig 4 / CoT 10)</a> by I...Samphus<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "216596", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Swordmaiden of Torm (Fig 8 / Brd 8 / CoT 24)</a> by Kaliban99<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "247650", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Sling Blade (Fighting Bard-SONG Version) Bard(21)/Fighter(4)/COT(15)</a> by TyrTemplar<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "241216", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Veteran Party-Leader V2 (Fighter 4/Bard 26/COT 10)</a> by Xylophone<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ptlee00 on 06/18/10 17:42</span></i></p>

Some additional comments about this build:<br><br>1.  I forgot to include:  Any non-Lawful, non-Evil alignment.<br><br>2.  I chose Craft Wand over Still Spell.  If your PW does not scale up Wand casting levels, then it may be worth it to switch it for Still Spell.<br><br>3.  Extra Music and Lingering Song increase the usefulness of "only" 16 Bard levels.  These are not critical and can be replaced but I like them in this build.<br><br>4.  I chose Scimitar because of Keen Edge (also available in wand form) and the way I chose the character's background (Desert nomad in the Arabian Nights / Prince of Persia mold).<br><br>5.  If you don't want or need the variety of feats, go RDD.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

My only real criticism is the conception.  Yah, count me in the camp that considers a different combo vastly superior.  At least drop four fighter levels for bard levels.  Still, the end result isn't <i>bad</i> at all, it just could be a whole lot better.<br><br>Oh, and Lingering Song at level 33 is ridiculous.  If you're going to take it (and this is a rare occasion where I can at least accept an argument for it's usefulness), do so much earlier.  Really though, dropping three feats (including lingering), and four fighter levels, for four more bard, and lasting inspirations, seems nearly a no-brainer.<br>_________________<br>Down with autofail!  Down with alignment restrictions!

Good observations Onion.  Lingering Song could come pre-epic if I shuffle a couple of feats around and drop one of my combat feats (Improved Knockdown probably).  I placed it at level 33 because it was really an after-thought and a nice-to-have in this build.  I could just drop it altogether and probably wouldn't miss it.<br><br>If I was to go Bard 20 / Fighter 10 / CoT 10 like your suggestion (which I may try as well), then Lasting Inspiration wouldn't come until the end of the build anyway (39 since I would want to max my Bard skill dumps).<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ptlee00 on 06/19/10 19:36</span></i></p>

That's quite a big difference from the original build though.  Still, as in many bard builds, 26/4/10 would be the split I'd suggest.
