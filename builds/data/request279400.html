Hi,<br>so it happens that on the server I play True Seeing has been modified - it only grants TS if you have 50+ spot, otherwise, you only get See Invisibility. It's SD time, isnt it? Whats your favourite SD build? What do you recommend?<br><br>Btw, the situation is not that simple. The server I play on focuses on PvP, getting to lvl 30 is relatively easy, after that, life becomes hell (can reach lvl 60 by legendary leveler). The max AC &amp; AB bonuses are +5. SD only gets HiPS at lvl 10. I think this is the info needed.<br><br>In the next few lines I will share my ideas, hope you have many comments about them!<br><br><br>1. Cleric/Rogue/SD<br>(probably Cleric 15 / Rogue 15 / SD 10)<br><br>a. Cleric <br>AB buffs (GMW [note: we can craft our own items, but can only add 3 weapon properties, so we like to make all 3 damage, not +5 EB], Divine Favor, Bless, Aid, Prayer, Battletide)<br>50% concealment by Improved Invisibility<br>Can have True Seeing (SD class skill is Spot, spots ability modifier is Wisdom, so its possible to have 50)<br><br>b. Rogue<br>Sneak attack<br>Bonus Feats after lvl 10 (Epic Skill Focus: Hide and Move Silently)<br>Pick Pocket, Tumble, Hide, Move Silently<br><br>Note: I was thinking about using a Large Shield with this build. It has only -2 to skill modifiers, but I can have +7 AC (+2 base +5 shield ac). Also, I dont think I want to use 2 weapons (need Ambidexterity, TWF, ITWF then, but I would get more Sneak Attacks) - what do you think?<br><br><br>2. Cleric/Monk/SD<br><br>a. Cleric<br>Same as above<br><br>b. Monk<br>Monk BAB progression<br>Extra AC by Wisdom<br>Extra feats KD and IKD (I want to take these with build 1 too, so if I IKD from HiPS all my attack will be sneak attacks)<br>Hide, Move Silently, Tumble are class skills<br><br><br>3. Paladin/Rogue/SD<br><br>a. Rogue<br>See above<br><br>b. Paladin<br>AB buffs - GMW, Divine Favor, Bless, Aid, Prayer. Dont forget Holy Sword! (one question: does Holy Sword's Dispel really use character lvl, not class lvl?)<br>Higher BAB, 4 attacks<br><br><br>Thank you for reading!<br>_________________<br>"I will be the last...and you will go first!"<br>Sarevok, Child of Bhaal<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Praetor_Ghastkill on 07/24/07 23:21</span></i></p>

Cleric gives you much more buffs than that, just to be aware of it, a Cleric buffs a lot better than a Paladin, though Holy Sword is pretty powerful, I hate the low duration it gets...<br><br>Between Monk and Rogue, well, SD is enough for Epic Dodge, so you don't need Rogue for it, but Rogue will give you sneak attack to use that HiPS effectively, while the Monk would be stronger against sneak-immune enemies, it probably doesn't adds as much power as a Rogue in PvP, and a Monk would get a lower AC since you wouldn't be able to wear armor and shield.<br><br>I'd take the Cleric / Rogue / Shadowdancer myself, though perhaps changing the spread to 17/13/10, I like to have the full spellbook.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

Tried an own Druid/Shifter/Assasin build, focused on Epic Kobold Commando Shape. I really liked the skills (105 Hide buffed, spot enough to have TS on our server), and I made him a little tank (maxed hp 902, DMg Reduction 9/-, Acid 10/-, Cold 10/-). It is nice to have a better EB than anyone on the server (+6 Kobold Commando Sword), and it has a few abilities as the cleric (imp invis, darkness, ultravision). The greates backdraw is his ab: cant get it higher then 48 (BAB 25, Dex 13, Feats 4, EB 6). Even if we think about an outside area (+2 ab) and a normal size enemy (+1 ab), its 51. I dont if this is enough. Max AC on our server is +5, so its not easy to have 70+ AC. From hide, enemy loses at least Dodge AC (5 from item, 4 from haste), so lets say The Avarage Player has 61 because he is flat-footed. I try to KD him, thats -4 ab...so I need to roll 14 or more to hit him from hide!!! Too low...maybe if I create a wand of true strike, but after 9 secs im dead meat.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;I'd take at least 25 cleric lvls to avoid being dispelled too often.
