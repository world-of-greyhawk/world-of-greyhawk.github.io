Okay this is the second version of <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "229579", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Masterful Wall</a> build.I was able to increase his damage, max hp, and I increased his will and reflex save by taking Grimnars advice. Also didn't loose my DR and ab. So overall I think this build is better then the first version. The biggest disadvantage to this build is the AC, which I tried to change, but didn't come out any different. So here is the True Masterful Wall.

Now we're talking. Very playable build for PvM you got now! Might I recommend x-classing skillpoints into 20 tumble for +4 AC, and into spellcraft 19(20) for +4 to saves vs spells. Both should keep you last a while longer. All those hitpoints and 27/- DR will make you last a while. Has the potential for nasty crits. His AB with normal Hammer is 42, right?<br><br>Well done, a much smoother build now.<br><br>It is possible to shuffle Epic feats for a bit more efficiency at lvl 40, but playability will suffer, it is best like it is.<br><br>Welcome to the guild, your revised version of your first build became quite good. Kudos.<br><br>*Edit* A good story along with the first version also, I like that.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Grimnir77 on 02/07/06 04:17</span></i></p>

Nice improvements.. but have you considered KD/ IKD -possibly for Toughness and Iron Will. I don't think you'll really notice the drop in HP.<br><br>Otherwise I second what Grim says about Tumble.

thanks for the feedback, just realized I forgot to mention that this build is playable from lvl 1-40 on my post. Yeah his ab is 42 with normal hammer, didnt catch that. I'll try some of your ideas about Tumble and KD/IKD and see what I can come up with.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ArcticDwarf900 on 02/07/06 12:24</span></i></p>

Minor tweak, by taking the 7th lvl of WM in epic and going FTR 6/WM 6/ DwD 8 preepic you could improve your fort and will saves by 1

Warhammer is the best choice, other than halberd. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">
