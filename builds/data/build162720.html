Eastern Warrior Barb23/WM7/F10<br><br>This character is supposed to represent the warriors that the crusaders fought...sort of.  The main point to this character is criticals.

Nice build, I really love melee tanks. I´m going to use it on a server I play, if you don´t mind.

I think it would have turned out slightly better if you had used cot levels instead of fighter levels you lose weapon spec feats but gain 5 to all saves lay hands and divine wrath...plus suit your zealot theme a little better.  It was a jihad after all...at least for the moors and saracens.<br>_________________<br>"In the end we are all dead men.

I agree about the CoT. Also ending up with Str 27 and Dex 15 is "wasteful".<br><br>This is a very attack minded tank, will be great fun to play!

Good point on the jihad...my problem would have been qualifying for WM as soon as I did.  I wanted to be able to start criting asap.  The 4 early fighter levels give me 3 quick feats.  Without that I wouldn't be able to qualify for WM untill lev 12 or later depending on if I started Cot at 9th.  I beleive the earlist you can start Cot is 9th level because you have to have an AB of 8, which you don't get until you com[plete 8th level...maybe as long as it is on the screen to get at 8th you could qualify for CoT at 8th...not sure.  But even at 8th I beleive I wouldn't get the 7 needed feats for WM untill 11th so I could then start WM at 12.  As it is now at 13th I get Ki Critical and am done with WM.<br><br>I have no problems with a modification however.  If you don't mind the build matureing a little later then CoT works fine.<br><br>Thnaks for the feedback....maybe I will redo it your way just to see how it works out.

Just because the strength isn't giving me another + to hit at 27 doesn't mean it's a waste.  It's extra carrying capacity, and if I have +5 to strength from equipment then I am at 32...I get my extra +1 now.
