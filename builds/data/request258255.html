Seems like itd be a nice combo.  Say 26-27 Sorc, 3-4 Monk, 10 PM.<br><br>How effective would that be as a caster?  Provided I got the Epic Spell focuses.  What am I missing out on besides epic feats reducing the Sorc levels to 26-27 from say a 38 (like a 38/1/1 Sorc/Pally for example).

Feats, as you say, which can be quite lacking in sorcerer builds to begin with, and spell-penetration. But unless you fight many monks, 26+ is usually sufficient, since the highest default SR in the toolset is 32. With 26 caster-levels you will penetrate with 75% of your spells roughly. Add in Spell Penetration feats if it becomes a problem. Your durations will also be shorter, and some damage spells will do less damage, mostly icestorm and Horrid Wilting, plus your damage shields. But remember that Palemaster brings in some nice tricks on it's own too, so it might be worth it. moreso in Wizards IMO, but still.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

My thoughts were similar in a few test builds I roughed out.<br><br>Sorcerer(25) Pale Master(10) Monk(5), or 26/10/4 for one last epic sorc feat.  I dont plan to melee so not really worried about KD/IKD that come with Monk 6.  Hence reducing to Monk 5 (purity of body) or Monk 4 (26 Sorc opening up another epic feat, and hopefully increasing my DC).<br><br>Human, any non-good<br>Stats: (final)<br>STR: 8<br>DEX: 12<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 14 <br>INT: 12<br>CHA:18 <br><br>Concentration 43(42)<br>Discipline 42(41)<br>Spellcraft 42(46)<br>Tumble 40(42)<br><br>Why? Courteous Magocracy, Luck of Heros...  This could open up a few feats.  In my case Id like to add another school to necromancy.  Personal preference in my case abjuration, or conjuration (Im a huge fan of gasses acid fog, stink cloud, plus web, grease, evards, my favorite spells in the game) schools big time.<br><br>I was thinking all stat bonuses into CHA.  I want DC as high as possible.  I usually go so far as to buff it with Charisma spell (maximized/or emp), and obviously items.  This gives me 30 CHA with only Great Cha II.  I havent built it out in a builder yet, but hopefully a 26/4/10 build this frees up another feat (where you took great cha 3).<br><br>If Im right, my tweaks using a 26/4/10 build opens up 3 feats, taking another school to Epic (conjuration, necro).  I was even thinking of dropping spell penetration...  That way Id get epic necro, conjur, and abjuration.  Use Mords to reduce SR when its a problem.<br><br>Anyways thanks for the spin on the build, looks like you created an original build there.  As I was unable to find any Sorc, monk, PM builds in Pulse caps search engine.  Grats.

Spell penetration goes against a target's Spell resistance; Your Spell's DC is for a targets Saving throws.<br><br>Basically, SR hits first; so if you can't penetrate the target's SR, your spell will not effect them (even if it is a no save spell).  That's why I suggested keeping the SP feats anyway, your Spell penetration will end up (If I figured it right, I could be off a little) at 32 +1d20 without them, or 38+1d20 with them.  At 38, even pure class monks will be hit close to 50% of the time from your spells.  A multiclass monk will almost always be hit.<br><br>Once you pass a creature's SR, then your spell's DC comes into effect <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>-4SakN<br><i>"never kiss a girl whose brothers have knife scars." <br>"never gamble without knowing a back way out."</i><br>-Robert Jordan
