You can find it here:<br>    Click Here<br>    It ended up being a wizard/fighter/WM 23/10/7<br><br><br>    Anyway, I have a challenge for anyone interested. I wanted to make a character with the HIGHEST ab ever with melee (without exploiting bugs). I think it would be a bard/RDD/wm, but I'm interested as to what you guys would come up with. Thanks!<br><br><br>Well, I went as high as 74 my build... The build as it is isn't good gor anything else, thought... I think best unbuffed AB would be 10 Fighter/Weapon master 30, but this one comes only 1 or 2 AB behind UNBUFFED. BAB is 25 for this one, and I remember fighter/WM has BAB *** high as 30... RDD gives +4 AB, but WM 30 means +1 AB compared to 25 levels... If I ain't missing modifiers it would mean that this build is 2 AB behind unbuffed. Quite a feat I'd say.<br><br>What are the AB progressions for Bard &amp; RDD? Is there BAB progress table somewhere on the net? If bard has something like 0,75 progress compared to sorcerer 0,5 (?) that would mean he'd get only 1 AB lower AB than Fighter/WM, and have better stats... Hmm... I guess that has been posted like million times before, thought, even after I've missed it.<br><br>Anyways, the build, which is highly unefficient due maxing of STR (For more efficient version, drop 2 STR and get 12-14 CON. Might lower all the way to 10 and still be more efficient in the end than Fighter/WM)<br><br>Human<br>5 Sor/10 RDD/25 WM<br>STR: 18 + 24 (10 level, 8 RDD + 6 Feat)<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 8 +2<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 13 +2<br>CHA: 12 +2<br><br>Level progression:<br>5 Sor (Lore 8, Intimidate 4) - &gt; 7 RDD -&gt; 8 WM -&gt; (17 WM &amp; 3 RDD in any way you want. Take RDD early for more skills or take last for maxed Spellcraft &amp; Concentration)<br><br>Taking 5 Sor -&gt; 7 RDD -&gt; 8 WM gives you BAB of 15 &amp; Three Attacks<br>Taking 5 Bard -&gt; 7 RDD -&gt; 8 WM gives you BAB of 16 &amp; Four attacks<br><br>Feats: Dodge, Mobility, Expertise, Weapon Focus: Spear (or any weapon sor/bard can wield), Spring Attack, Whirldwind Attack, Great Strenght I-VII, Epic Prowess<br><br>Sorcerer AB 74: 25 BAB, + 19 STR bonus (43+5 from Bull's Strenght), + 1 WF: X, +2 EWF: X, +1 SWF, +1 Epic Prowess, +5 WM bonus +20 True Strike = 74<br><br>This AB was checked from the roll info (was using +7 spear, so Character Sheet said it was +81). Interestingly, unless you find out where the last +1 came from, this would indicate that Epic Prowess actually works correctly... In 1.59 version (Read many times how it doesn't stack and all that...)<br>_________________<br>"Lavamancers use three aspects of magic to make a golem: Transmutation; to mold the golem, Necromancery; to bind a soul to control the golem, and Evocation; to blast the damn thing on fire."<br>- Jushak Firestone - Grim Lavamancer<br>     <br><br><br><br>More efficient version of my high AB build would be:<br><br>Bard (sor) 5/RDD 10/ WM 25<br><br>14 STR + 10 + 6<br>14 DEX<br>14 CON +2<br>10 WIS<br>14 INT +2<br>12 CHA +2<br><br>Lose 2 AB, and 1 more for each 2 Great Strenght you drop... You might want to leave STR uneven, thought, if you insist on using Bull's Strenght. Unless you are keen on buffing all the time (and leaving the last RDD level to lvl 40 for maxing Concentration &amp; Spellcraft) you should use Bard instead of Sorcerer, for +1 AB, low bardsong and earlier +1 to AC from Tumble.<br><br>Any way you do the build, you might want to take last RDD lvl between 37-40 for +8 in spell saves (Spellcraft 40) at expense of about 18 skillpoints and having harder time leveling up the character.<br><br>WARNING: This build is subject to human EXP penalty BUG between levels 13-16, at lvl 20 and almost all of the epic levels, depending on when you take the RDD levels. If the 3 last RDD levels are taken last, EXP penalty BUG starts at lvl 20, and stays on for all the epic levels.<br>_________________<br>"Lavamancers use three aspects of magic to make a golem: Transmutation; to mold the golem, Necromancery; to bind a soul to control the golem, and Evocation; to blast the damn thing on fire."<br>- Jushak Firestone - Grim Lavamancer<br><br>Edited By Jushak Brimstone on 03/05/04 08:48:08<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 16:24</span></i></p>
