Concept here is to make a Char that is just damn hard to kill.  You can change Dwarf for Orc and avoid the xp penilty, just change around the Str and Con numbers.  Also a few of the feats will be given if you want to go a high AC route or more diverse feat combination.  The build is a bit slow developing as your first 20 levels will be one class.<br><br>CE Dwarf L24 Barbarian L10 Pale Master L6 Mage<br><br>Scythe and Medium Armor<br><br>Str 16 (22)<br>Dex 10<br>Con 18 (22)<br>Wis 8<br>Int 15<br>Cha 6<br><br>L1  B Exotic Weapon Feat <br>L2  B<br>L3  B Knockdown<br>L4  B<br>L5  B<br>L6  B Scythe Weapon Focus<br>L7  B<br>L8  B<br>L9  B Imp KnockDown<br>L10 B<br>L11 B<br>L12 B Imp Critical Scythe<br>L13 B<br>L14 B<br>L15 B Energy Resist fire / Expertise (for high AC option)<br>L16 B<br>L17 B<br>L18 B Toughness* / Improved Expertise<br>L19 B<br>L20 B<br>L21 M Epic DR 1 (Con needs to be 21 ATP)<br>L22 M<br>L23 M<br>L24 B Terifying Rage (Max Intimidate skill)<br>L25 PM<br>L26 PM<br>L27 PM Epic DR II<br>L28 PM<br>L29 M<br>L30 PM Epic Weapon Focus Scythe<br>L31 PM<br>L32 PM<br>L33 PM Epic Iron Will* <br>L34 M  Extend Spell (Bonus Feat)<br>L35 PM<br>L36 B  Epic Skill Focus Disapline <br>L37 PM<br>L38 M<br>L39 B  Epic Powers / Armor Skin<br>L40 B  Epic DR III (Bonus Feat)<br><br>Skills: 208+ pts<br>Disapline 43 (59)<br>Intimidate 43 (41)<br>Spell Craft 40 (for the saves)<br>Hearing 43 (42)<br>Taunt 40 / Tumble 20 (lower AC or Bump your own)<br><br>AB 40/35/30/25 Plain Scythe<br>   48/43/38/33 +5 Scythe and Greater Rage<br><br>AC Nude 18 / 34 (if you went the high AC route -10ab)<br><br>Damage D8 + 6  19-20 X4<br>       D8 + 14 18-20 X4 Greater Rage +5 Keen'd Scythe<br>     <br>L1-5 Buffs eather L6 or L12 duration.

Hehe.. DC 41.. it's actually your intimidate + mods +d20 vs their will + d20.  The DC could be 42 to 61 in this case.

I assume you mean wizard when you say mage, as there is no 'mage' class. People may think you mean monk when you list 'M6'.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Palemaster in the build I posted provides +10ac which offsets taking a class that would enable maximising tumble. <br><br>In the original build you could adjust the skills to have 20 tumble for +4 ac and with 8 levels of PM that also provides an additional +6 ac.<br><br>I should had mentioned that tumble is one of the skills that I take up to 20.

It might help a little if you are fighting a cleric with darkfire, or someone with a flaming weapon, but really if elemental damage is available, noone will pick fire because of the RDD's immunity to it.  Against powerful spellcasting, 5 less damage won't do crap.  Really, it would be far more beneficial to get Blind Fight here, although various other feats might also be useful.<br><br>Edit #2:  I obviously need to learn to read.  You took Blind Fight.  I guess you can more or less ignore this post.

"Really, it would be far more beneficial to get Blind Fight here, although various other feats might also be useful."<br><br><br>Yes, Blind fighting is a more usefull feat.  And you did read it right the first time.  The second build is from someone else but the same base but they go a different way.  I see these as<br><br>Build #1 - More DR, HPs slightly better ab (?).<br>Build #2 - More AC, Epic Warding<br><br>I took the DR Fire feat since the 'background' of the build is DR... he cant be hurt and Fire is the most used elemental damage used.  With the Natural DR, DR feats and Elemetal DR and IM to Crits he should be very hard to damage.  But from a every combat use... yes the blind fighting feat might be better if you expect to face alot of concelled NPCs or PCs.

Could you use Bard in place of Wizard to qualify for Palemaster? This would give you Tumble, Discipline, and Use Magic Device as well as the bard songs.<br><br>Kaliban.
