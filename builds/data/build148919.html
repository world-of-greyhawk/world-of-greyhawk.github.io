<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM</b><br><br>Well I haven't yoyed with the shifter ina while (especially since I've been playing a lot with PRC builds), so I figuredI would mix a class with druid shifter that I haven't seen done on these forums. SO I mixed in an assassin class. It had some very interesting results. First thing was a decent sized sneak attack. Ever see a sneak attacking minitaur or a death sladd lord? It's not pretty for the victim. It is easily some of the highest damage I've seen without using smite.Also all the assassin spells can be cast while in shifted form. This build really allows you to pick the optimal shapes to take advantage of your opponents weakness. It also has enough UMD to abuse a few other items out there.

Feats like knockdown, disarm, epic prowess and armor skin all give their bonus no matter what form you are using. This shifter build doesn't go after dragon shape. It could manage it with some removal of other feats, but the dragon idea doesn't work well with manueverability. It would be neat to be a sneak attacking dragon, but I definately can live without it. I also took construct shape only because I really didn't have a better choice. If I were using PRc I would of taken intuitive attack and a few others in place of some I took here for those who want to try this build with the PRC. I also wouldn't take the 5 spellcraft ina rebuild. I took four to start with and then was like WHY? I just took the 5th point for the save bonus and stopped. With Epic skill focus in discipline I have a fairly decent total of 31. Using various shapes I can get feats like improved evasion and HIPS (kobold) to spell resistance to spell immunity to damage resistance. I basically just tailor to the encounter.<br><br>The build does well with normal items, but some key things to look at getting are boots of the sun soul. The dodge ac and dex booost carries over into shifted forms. I like scimitar of speed as the haste carries over as does the energy damage. Gauntlets are fairly useless, so get some that only affect your normal form. No shifter form takes gauntlet powers with it. Most shield, helmet and armor abilities merge into forms, AC bonuses and weapon enhancement bonuses do not merge though.<br><br>I am planning on tweaking it a bit, but I think I have most things where I want.<br><br>Enjoy it, and critique please.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 08/03/05 20:50</span></i></p>

I'll dig that up when I get home tonight. In normal form the base attack isn't all that high, and AC is only in the low 20s. In most shifted forms the AC shoots up into the mid 40s to low 50s. In most shifted forms, the AB is in high 30s to low 40s. I think his BAB is +25 with three attacks. All pre epic levels are using the 3/4 advancement rate with no stat adjustment, and the +10 from the epic levels.

I normal form my AC is 20 and my AB is +24 with three attacks. In shifter form naked it jumps around between low 33-40 with AB and AC. <br><br>With some items from the OC on this character in drow form I can get AC in high 40s low 50s and AB the same.
