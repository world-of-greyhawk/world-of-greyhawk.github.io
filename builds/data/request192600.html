I've been trying to build a sneaky Shifter but keep tying myself up in knots<br><br>Classes<br>Druid:Has to be 5th, 13th for empowered Ice Storms in Rakshasa form (15th for maximised Ice Storms)<br>Shifter:Has to be 17th to get Epic Humanoid forms<br>Sneaky Class:This is the problem bit. For role-play reasons I don't want a Monk, just doesn't fit my idea of the character. Looked at Shadowdancer but if I went that way only Kobold Commando would have Sneak attack and it also gets HIPS and Improved Evasion for free so I think the choice is between Rogue and Assassain. Assassain gets much less skill points but its Death Attack stacks with the kobold Commandos free Sneak Attack. At the moment I'm inclined to go with Assassain and end up Druid (13)/Shifter (17)/Assassain (10).<br><br>Stats<br>Str 10<br>Dex 10<br>Con 14<br>Int 16<br>Wis 16<br>Cha 08<br>All Stat increases would go into Wisdom<br><br>Skills<br>I'd have 344 skill points tp play with<br>I'd like to max out (or near enough) Hide, Move Silently, Spellcraft, Tumble and UMD. Possibly Discipline as a Cross-Class skill despite the cost.<br><br>Other than that I want the character to be able to do the usual rogue things -Craft/Disble/Set Traps, Open Locks, Search mainly, some Listen and/or Spot and Lore<br><br>Finally a few points in Animal Empathy, Heal, Pick Pockets<br>No Persuade etc, this is not a people person<br><br>Feats<br>Pre-Epic:Alertness, Toughness, Extend Spell, WF(Unarmed Strike), Expertise, IC(Unarmed Strike), Improved Expertise, Blind-Fight<br><br>Post-Epic:Armour Skin, Epic Prowess, Undead Shape, EWF(Unarmed Strike), ESF(Hide), ESF(Move Silently), Empower Spell, 1 spare<br><br>Any thoughts?<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.
