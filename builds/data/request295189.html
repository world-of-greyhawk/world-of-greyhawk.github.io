Okay, I really like this build, <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "191493", "", ",", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> but it to attack a lot faster. By faster, do all I have to do is give him a different weapon or should I change some feats and stuff. And would a longsword or rapier be better. If you were wondering I don't want a shield and no dual wield.

There is no attack speed in NWN, so your weapon doesn't matter. All that matters is your BAB.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

But there is <i>initiative</i><br><br>From NWNWiki:<br><i><b>Initiative Checks:</b> At the start of a battle, each combatant makes an initiative check. An initiative check is a Dexterity check. Each character applies his or her Dexterity modifier to the roll. Characters act in order, counting down from highest result to lowest. In every round that follows, the characters act in the same order (unless a character takes an action that results in his or her initiative changing; see Special Initiative Actions). If two or more combatants have the same initiative check result, the combatants who are tied act in order of total initiative modifier (highest first). If there is still a tie, the tied characters should roll again to determine which one of them goes before the other. <br><br>There are four feats in NWN that improve your initiative. <br><br>Blooded (Initiative improves by +2) <br>Thug (Initiative improves by +2) <br>Improved Initiative (Initiative improves by +4) <br>Superior Initiative (This epic feat replaces Improved Initiative and gives +8 to initiative) <br></i><br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

Initiative still isn't going to make him attack faster though. The only thing that will affect it is his BAB and whether or not he dual-wields (which he noted he doesn't want) and/or is Hasted. (I'm taking the 'attack faster' to mean he wants more attacks in the round, as this is almost always what people mean when they say that).<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Doesn't your weapon effect that? Like greatsword is a lot slower than a dagger. So I guess now I am wondering just wondering what sword would be good for a fast but still good a damage for a solo wield one handed (rp reasons)<br><br>edit: Ok I am just going to look for a new build that has monk speed, but uses rapier for crit, what it be dumb to not take advantage of kama or unarmed.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Monk9292 on 04/14/08 21:08</span></i></p>

No. There is no weapon speed in NWN. If your character uses a dagger or a greatsword, he'll get the same number of attacks (and he'll attack at the same speed).<br><br>As for the Monk question: if you want to get the maximum number of attacks, you should use a kama and dual wield. I honestly don't see the point of using Monk in a rapier wielding build unless you're DEX-based, finessing and going unarmored.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
