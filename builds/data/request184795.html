Does anyone have a pure monk build? I might be willing to mix in 2 lvls or rogue or assasin. On the pw I play you have to take 3 lvls of rogue before you can take shadowdancer so can't go there. New to NWN so need to know starting and ending stats,best race,best feats.<br><br>Thank you

His body, mind and spirit are finely tuned to a perfect harmony such that he is able to channel ki energy to knockdown his opponents, deliver quick death with his bare fists and shrug off most spells, diseases, poisons, and harmful mind-affecting effects. When he engages in combat, he moves with incredible dexterity and grace, and his speed when attacking and moving is legendary. He is also a mastery of stealth, able to hide and sneak behind his enemies and surprise them, and even keep himself concealed after attacking. When meditating, he can also mend his wounds and bandage his allies with monastic healing skills.

HP<br>400<br><br><br>Equipment and Magic Items<br><br>The Iconic Monk usually wears simple and comfortable monk robes, using only his deadly fists as weapons and his own diamond-like body as armor. However, he would not be opposed to specifically designed monk gloves that add to his attack power, damage and efficiency, such as Gloves of the Yellow Rose +5 or Gloves of the Hin Fist +5. He also would benefit from magically enhanced equipment for monks, such as Robes of the Dark Moon, Robes of the Shining Hand +5, and Boots of the Sun Soul +5. Protective gear such as Amulet of Natural Armor, Ring of Protection, Greater Belt of Guiding Light and Ring of Power as well as items that grant dexterity, wisdom, strength and constitution would further make him more dangerous. An item that grants permanent haste would make him veritably the fastest creature one might encounter, and allows him to make even more attacks with his fists.<br>_________________<br>I wish you well. <br><br>griphook <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 03/11/05 01:17</span></i></p>

Nice builds, thanks. I'm partial to the Iconic monk build-are strong sould and luck of heroes more important than dodge and mobility?<br><br>Do you get circle kick free?<br><br>Which build do you prefer?

You don't get circle kick free.  Don't bother taking it as a feat though, it doesn't work correctly.  As it stands now, when circle kick is activated, you unlock from the opponent you are currently fighting, and then waste another round getting locked back on him.  Very annoying stuff.  <br><br>The main differences are that the Ultimate Monk is more offensive minded and the Iconic Monk is more defensive minded, I guess it comes down to whichever style you are most comfortable with.<br>_________________<br>If everyone is thinking alike, then someone is failing to think.
