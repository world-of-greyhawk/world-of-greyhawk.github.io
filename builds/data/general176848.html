Well - I know that people have got some insane AC builds with Dwarven Defender, but as a general rule they seem to have a bad AB. Also, I know they are not what I'm looking for here. A while back on a PW I don't play on any more, I adventured for a while with this girl who had a character with a decent AB and damage output and an AC well over 100. I have no idea how she did it, and she wouldn't tell me. She definitely wasn't a dwarf, so couldn't have been a Defender. She used bard song a lot and it was very respectable, so she must have had quite a few bard levels. More than that I just don't know. Can anybody puzzle out how she did it? I sure as hell can't, and it's been bugging me for a while now. She used a rapier and shield, and seemed to be in light armour, if that helps any.

Most likely bard / Palemaster of some sort.<br><br>Bard gets umd which gives them access to UMD - which means that monk dodge boots are open to them. Palemaster gets an AC bonus based on level. Also what sort of items are available. <br><br>An AC of over 90 is easy enough to obtain with items available in HotU if you think out the build. <br><br>If this was a low magic world then Im actually quite impressed.<br><br>Syrath

Well, no, it was a very high magic world. Maybe I've just thought this out wrong - I'm going to list everything she could conceivably have had and see if it then starts to add up for me: <br><br> Base 10<br> Dex could be up to about 45 with items I guess... say +17 (Total 27) <br> Deflection +10 (Total 37)<br> Natural +10 (Total 47) <br> Armour +10 (needs to be monk outfit to allow for dex) (Total 57) <br> Dodge +10 (Total 67)<br> PM bonus... don't know how high her level was, though I know she was a level 16 bard at least. Let's give her the benefit of the doubt and say levle 20 PM, so Armour +12 (Total 79) <br> Improved Expertise +10 (Total 89) <br> Bard Song +5 (Total 94)<br> Shield +13 possible (Total 107)<br><br>... Hmmm, guess you're right. Answered my own question, how about that. :lol<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Eluvan on 01/23/05 13:53</span></i></p>
