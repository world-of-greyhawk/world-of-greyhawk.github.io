Ah a wonderful build, the cleric/ftr/defender!!<br><br>There are several ways to go about this char, and it depends on how much of a cleric or defender you want.<br><br>To get the most of cleric lvls I suggest to go 4ftr/16 cleric before 20.  That will give you 4atts/rd and a nice cleric base, IF you want a higher cleric char (and truthfully, if you are thinking ftr/clerc/defendr, you should be trying to get that).  After 20 its really up to you.. You can get away with 1 more ftr lvl at 24 if you take epic wpn foc at 20 with defender lvl. Its up to you to determine how many defender lvls you want.. forgive me if im mistaken, i am away from home and my notes, but 19 defender lvls is not too shabby.  The only other thing to think about is how much cleric power you want.. gettin 20 wis is nice, but are lvl 9 spells really important to your char, who may be more melee friendly?  Its up to you.  The last thing though, because you will have less than 20 cleric lvls, for your buffs to be of real use, id suggest Extend Spell.. kinda obvious, but ive talked with a few cleric players who never thought of it  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Hope that helps.<br><br>Peace
