Both will have epic dodge, 10d6 sneak attacks, similar AC and AB, and 50% concealment capability.<br><br>This build's advantages compared to the other are that SC 5 is on all the time, while empty body isn't, that harper scout provides a number of situational saving throw bonuses and abilities to increase saves even more when needed, and that harper scouts can self-buff with cat's grace.  <br><br>The two biggest disadvantages are the lack of HIPS, which is an extremely powerful ability, and the fact that it doesn't get the level 20 monk's immunity to mind-effective spells.<br><br>Personally I have to say that I think the 20 monk/19 rogue/1 SD is the superior build unless you can get items that make you immune to mind spells, or are in an environment where you need 50% conceal all the time in epic-level combat.<br><br><b>Q: So why do you say this build is best for high magic environments?</b><br>A:  Because powerful magic items cover up this build's relative weakness (lack of mind spell immunity) and mitigate against the strengths of other dex-monk builds (such as HIPS).  This is because you can get items to give you spell immunities on high-magic worlds, and on high magic worlds true seeing is much more common.  High magic worlds also serve to make this build more attractive because the people and enemies on them tend to have higher ABs, favoring SC 5's "always on" protection over empty body's limited duration, limited uses protection.<br><br><b>Q: Could I actually take a favored enemy with my harper feats?</b><br>A:  I think so, but you'd lose epic prowess in the mix, weakening your build overall.  You'd have a bonus against your favored enemy - but lose the same AB bonus vs everything else.<br><br><b>Q: Uh, I can't think of anything else to ask.  Is there anything about this build that isn't obvious?</b><br>A:  Probably not.  I see it mainly as a variant on the dex monk character that hasn't been too done to death and provides a roleplaying opportunity for people who want to take harper scout, or as a way for people whose servers bar them from taking 1 SD level for HIPS to have a character with similar performance.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By griphook on 09/30/05 18:38</span></i></p>

The great dex feats are important for getting dex to 30 in time to get SC 5.  You need at least one "extra" great dex feat from somewhere in the build in order to have both epic weapon focus and SC 5 without having to change race and/or starting stats to start with 19 or 20 dex.  You need another "extra" great dex to fit epic prowess.<br><br>I don't think great dex is in the rogue bonus feat list when taking rogue levels (it's not in the rogue epic bonus feat list, anyway, and I'm already using my rogue bonus feats to get the SC feats), but I knew I could get two from harper scout.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Xylo: nifty. Nice to see someone else using HS to good advantage (I've posted a number of builds with it, but for the most part they're rare).

This can allow you to swap two pre-epic feats (that you spend on alertness and iron will) for two epic feats (that you free up by taking great whatever as a HS bonus).  Or it can be used to free up starting stat points.<br><br>In the process you get useful save bonuses and useful buffing abilities.

Heh, I've found even more uses for the HS bonus feats. You can also pick up Epic Will and/or Epic Skill Focus if you want.<br><br>I've got builds that do just that. My 'Ultimate Rogue' uses the HS for the Epic Skill Focus feats, and my 'Guardsman' uses it for both Epic Will and Epic Skill Focus, as do both versions of my 'Harper's Vengeance' builds.<br><br>I really like the HS class and find the pre-epic feat investment is well worth it. (The skill point requirements can sometimes hurt, but access to Tumble and Discipline as class skills later can easily make up for that).<br><br>Unfortunately I'm not a fan of Monks, but I know there are lots of people that love them.<br><br>Anyway, I'm done hijacking your thread!<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

"Only" SC 4... heh heh.  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  <br><br>In terms of cost/benefits tradeoffs I'm sure that HIPS + SC 4 is much superior to no HIPS and SC 5 in an even remotely normal environment.  The only place my original build would arguably start to come out ahead is an environment where just about everything has true seeing.<br><br>In fact when I'm making a 'normal environment' dex monk I tend to stop at SC 2, and then use empty body for tight spots.  The extra feats that frees up can go to solving the age-old enemies of the monk - low AB for a melee and trouble punching through DR.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
