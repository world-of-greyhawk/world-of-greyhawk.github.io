I have a request for anyone who wishes a challenge. I would like to see some builds posted that are specifically designed to take out a lawfull good aligned 20 pally 10 monk 10 rogue with 80 ac epic dodge and 61 ab . I suspect off the top of my head a bard blackguard rdd would work, but i would like some input from the community. Thanx in advance for any and all replies..<br>                 xaentian(Mobius)

I apologize ahead of time before anyone posts, but i think i may have been a bit vague.  My thinking would have been bard rdd bg dual wielding kukris. Dual wielding because of the fact the build this one is supposed to be used against has epic dodge.Bard/rdd for the bard/curse song affects and stat increases for rdd and bg for smite good.  Any and all builds are welcomed how ever as i am melee minded only, and need hit over the head to even think of caster builds and such <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  Once again my thanks in advance for ideas. <br>                         Xaentian(Mobius)
