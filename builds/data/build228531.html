This is an attempt to have a cleric build with ED and 50% undispellable concealment (from II) plus all the cleric goodies. <br><br>You make up for the low damage output with buffs (divine power+bull's strength and you reach the STR cap) and spells (darkfire, GMW, divine favor). War domain gives you the possibility to buff your DEX, directly increasing your AB and AC, via cat's grace and aura of vitality. Aid, endurance and AoV give a nice bump to your lowish HP too. War domain power gives you an extra bump to DEX and CON for a few rounds (buff your CHA before using it) which should bring you to the stat cap, altough for a very short time.<br><br>One might want to drop CON to 10 and increase INT to 14 for extra skill points to make better use of roguish skills and trickery domain power.<br>Another possible thing to do is to drop ESP for a metamagic feat (empower spell). It means accepting a 5% chance of not piercing through maximun toolset SR, but it should be worth it. To remove that 5% drop 1 lvl rogue for 1 lvl cleric. It cost you 6 skill points and a long interval without UMD bumps.<br><br>Being a dexer you'll want the best monk robes you can get your hands on, DEX items especially if not taking War domain (you'll not be able to buff up your DEX), maybe some CHA gear for your domain powers. WIS enhancing gear for extra spells is also welcome as is fort save gear.<br><br>You've got HiPS, IE, slippery mind, defensive roll from your SD lvls, plus shadow evade for DR 10/+3, +4 AC for 5 rounds, 3/day which gives you more options for when the situation gets tough (as if your clerical powers were not enough).<br><br>Your sneak attack is weak, just consider it an added bonus to your damage to make up for your low natural damage output, which you can exploit with HiPS.<br><br>Having not high WIS and no spell foci one should focus on spells with no save or special saves or saves for half damage (harm, hammer of the gods, slay living, storm of vengeance, flamestrike, firestorm, searing light vs undead, ice storm and creeping doom if one chooses the domain granting them).<br><br><b>THE PRAYING SHADOW</b><br>Cleric(26), Rogue(4), Shadowdancer(10)<br>Halfling, any alignment<br><i>PvM playable 1-40, untested PvP</i><br><br>STR: 8<br>DEX: 18 (26)<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 16 (22)<br>INT: 12<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 352<br>Skillpoints: 211<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 22/27/30<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Traps: +2, Fear: +2, improved evasion, slippery mind<br>BAB: 24<br>AB (max, naked): 37 (melee), 35 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 29/32<br>Spell Casting: Cleric(9)<br>SP: 32+1d20<br>Sneak attack: +2d6<br><br><br>01: Rogue(1): Dodge<br>02: Cleric(1): Domain Trickery, Domain War (or Magic or Plant)<br>03: Cleric(2): Weapon Finesse<br>04: Cleric(3): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br>05: Cleric(4)<br>06: Cleric(5): Mobility<br>07: Rogue(2): {Evasion}<br>08: Shadowdancer(1): DEX+1, {Hide in Plain Sight}, (DEX=20)<br>09: Cleric(6): Extend Spell<br>10: Shadowdancer(2): {Darkvision, Uncanny Dodge I}<br>11: Cleric(7)<br>12: Cleric(8): DEX+1, Weapon Focus, (DEX=21)<br>13: Cleric(9)<br>14: Shadowdancer(3)<br>15: Cleric(10): Spell Penetration<br>16: Cleric(11): WIS+1, (WIS=17)<br>17: Shadowdancer(4)<br>18: Cleric(12): Greater Spell Penetration<br>19: Cleric(13)<br>20: Cleric(14): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>21: Shadowdancer(5): Great Wisdom I, {Defensive Roll}, (WIS=18)<br>22: Shadowdancer(6)<br>23: Shadowdancer(7): {Slippery Mind}<br>24: Cleric(15): DEX+1, Great Wisdom II, (DEX=23), (WIS=19)<br>25: Cleric(16)<br>26: Cleric(17)<br>27: Cleric(18): Epic Weapon Focus<br>28: Rogue(3): DEX+1, (DEX=24)<br>29: Cleric(19)<br>30: Cleric(20): Epic Spell Penetration<br>31: Shadowdancer(8)<br>32: Shadowdancer(9): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br>33: Shadowdancer(10): Epic Dodge, {Improved Evasion}<br>34: Cleric(21)<br>35: Cleric(22)<br>36: Cleric(23): DEX+1, Epic Prowess, Armor Skin, (DEX=26)<br>37: Cleric(24)<br>38: Cleric(25)<br>39: Rogue(4): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=20)<br>40: Cleric(26): WIS+1, Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=22)<br><br><br>Feedback and constructive criticism is kindly appreciated.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 01/27/06 19:34</span></i></p>

Nicely put together... is there a specific reason for a starting STR of 8? You could of course put 2 from here into INT - giving you more skills to enhance your roguishness.<br><br>Taking rogue on the last level would allow you to max more skills, but it is a balancing act between Conc and Spellcraft really. <br><br>Otherwise, its a shame you can't fit in Empower Spell.<br>  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">

Nice build.<br><br>I find having a strength of 6 is very hard to deal with, if only because of carrying capacity, unless of course bags of holding are easily available early on.  Still, 211 skill points is not enough to work with for this build.  That only allows 5 skills maxed or near maxed: Hide, Move Silently, Tumble, UMD, and...Spellcraft?  Even if you gimp one or two of the core skills, you'll still only be able to make token concentration checks, and you don't have anything left for any of the utility skills boosted by trickery domain powers (besides Hide and MS).<br><br>Rather than dropping strength to 6, I would either drop starting con to 10, since this build won't be tanking anyway, or starting dex to 17, then retool the epic feats a little to still allow ED on level 33.<br>_________________<br>There's always time to procrastinate.

Thanks for the feedback!<br> <br>I agree that skillpoints are in short supply. Starting STR at 6 is of course possible but can be very limiting early on given the small carrying capacity.<br>I'd rather drop, as I noted, starting CON to 10 and increasae INT to 14.<br><br>Empower spell is easily obtainable by dropping 1 rogue lvl for cleric and dropping ESP, but that means a long time without UMD bumps. Otherwise accept a 5% chance (roll of 1 on a d20) of not piercing 32 SR by simply dropping ESP and keeping 4 lvls rogue.<br><br>Otherwise, I tried to toy with the build a little and here are the results.<br><br><b>THE PRAYING SHADOW v.2</b><br>Cleric(26), Rogue(4), Shadowdancer(10)<br>Halfling, any alignment<br><br>STR: 6<br>DEX: 17 (26)<br>CON: 10<br>WIS: 16 (22)<br>INT: 16<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Hitpoints: 312<br>Skillpoints: 297<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/27/30<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Traps: +2, Fear: +2<br>BAB: 24<br>AB (max, naked): 36 (melee), 34 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 29/32<br><br>Concentration 43(43), Disable Trap 18(23), Hide 42(50), Move Silently 40(50), Open Lock 15(23), Search 6(9), Set Trap 15(25), Spellcraft 42(45), Tumble 40(48), UMD 36(35)<br><br>with domain power and dex buffs you can set, disable and find deadly traps on a roll of 1 (you've got +13 just from the trickery domain and that's enough to grant you automatic success)<br><br>01: Rogue(1): Dodge<br>02: Cleric(1): Domain Trickery, Domain War<br>03: Cleric(2): Weapon Finesse<br>04: Cleric(3): DEX+1, (DEX=18)<br>05: Cleric(4)<br>06: Cleric(5): Mobility<br>07: Rogue(2): {Evasion}<br>08: Shadowdancer(1): DEX+1, {Hide in Plain Sight}, (DEX=19)<br>09: Cleric(6): Extend Spell<br>10: Cleric(7)<br>11: Cleric(8)<br>12: Cleric(9): DEX+1, Empower Spell, (DEX=20)<br>13: Shadowdancer(2): {Darkvision, Uncanny Dodge I}<br>14: Shadowdancer(3)<br>15: Cleric(10): Weapon Focus<br>16: Cleric(11): WIS+1, (WIS=17)<br>17: Shadowdancer(4)<br>18: Cleric(12): Spell Penetration<br>19: Cleric(13)<br>20: Cleric(14): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br>21: Shadowdancer(5): Great Wisdom I, {Defensive Roll}, (WIS=18)<br>22: Shadowdancer(6)<br>23: Shadowdancer(7): {Slippery Mind}<br>24: Cleric(15): DEX+1, Great Wisdom II, (DEX=22), (WIS=19)<br>25: Cleric(16)<br>26: Cleric(17)<br>27: Cleric(18): Greater Spell Penetration<br>28: Rogue(3): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br>29: Cleric(19)<br>30: Cleric(20): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=24)<br>31: Shadowdancer(8)<br>32: Shadowdancer(9): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br>33: Shadowdancer(10): Epic Dodge, {Improved Evasion}<br>34: Cleric(21)<br>35: Cleric(22)<br>36: Cleric(23): DEX+1, Epic Weapon Focus, Armor Skin, (DEX=26)<br>37: Cleric(24)<br>38: Cleric(25)<br><br>v2.1: Go for final WIS 22, selecting two great WIS<br><br>39: Rogue(4): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=20)<br>40: Cleric(26): WIS+1, Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=22)<br><br>v 2.2: otherwise drop final WIS to 20 to keep EP and ESP<br><br>39: Rogue(4): Epic Prowess<br>40: Cleric(26): WIS+1, Epic Spell Penetration, (WIS=20)<br><br>What do you think of these versions?<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Divine power will give you 18 STR straight away, bags of holding are often easily available and anyhow the v.1 has 8 STR just for the reason to increase carrying capacity. <br><br>That said, it's still supposed to be a priest, altough a stealthy one, and not a thief <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  The stealthy skills are supposed to aid him in the service of his God.

Do you like it more like this Darkinferno? Had to drop disable traps, nerf open lock, UMD, spellcraft and concentration (with respect to v.2) but starting STR is at least 8.

Thanks avado! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>HP are really lowish, indeed, but you can easily get +200 HP with just 2 spells (aura of vitality and a lucky empowered endurance) and even get over the stat cap (CON)for a few rounds with war domain power. If the situation gets tough both war domain power and shadow evade give you damage reduction and great sanctuary will get you out of trouble if HiPS is not enough. If you feel you need more defense magic domain (stoneskin) or plant domain (barkskin) are good choices also because you get either ice storm or creeping doom.<br><br>And as you pointed out, the real problem is hitting/hurting you. Not only you've got ED and 50% undispellable concealment, you have got UMD to access the best monk gear and scrolls to improve your defenses and your cleric buffs to pump up your AC like there's no tomorrow and further increase your defenses. And consider you can set deadly traps too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif"> <br><br>If played right, this halfling is a doom machine!<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò
