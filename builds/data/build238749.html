Castle Trizkan, a man appears at the gate....<br><br>Guard: "No one can enter the castle."<br>Man: "Nevertheless, I need to go inside, I bring an important message for King Richard."<br>The guard pulls out his sword and shield, and changes to combat mode: "Yeah, sure, I said nobody crosses this place, now you die."<br>The guard attacks the man, but was unable to hit him, the man just hits lightly the guard's armor and crossed to the other side.<br>Guard: "You won't escape you... you... what? My body, I can't move!"<br>Man: "Don't panic, you will be able to move in a few hours, or die, either one of those, but I will be long gone by then."<br>The man enters the castle.<br><br>-"But Your Majesty, we could forge an alliance, there is no need to kill thousands of innocent lives."<br>King Richard: "I said that my army will assault the capital and that is how it will be, Generals, you have your orders."<br><br>Suddenly, the door to the King’s Hall opens drastically.<br><br>King Richard: "What is this!? I ordered no one to be let inside, I'm busy."<br>Man: "I'm sorry, but I couldn't wait."<br>King Richard: "Who the hell are you an what the hell do you want?"<br>Man: "My name is not of importance, I'm only a messenger, King Remulan has sent me, to avoid the needless killing of your army, he would like to end this matter peacefully."<br>King Richard: "That bastard, always thinking he can win, ha ha."<br>Man: "What is your answer?"<br>King Richard: "Easy, kill this man and send his dead body as an answer, if that's not clear enough, send a note that says: "You're going to die"."<br>Man: "A pity you have chosen that..."<br><br>The Generals take their weapons out and start an attack against the man. The man wasn't just a messenger though.... with a single hit, every general fell, as their bodies stop responding...<br><br>King Richard: "No way... You’re an assassin aren't you? But I won't get killed" Draws out an enormous sword.<br>Man: "An assassin? don't try to put names to my technique, my fighting style is more art than assassination, let me prove it personally." with a quick jump falls over King Richard and the effect was the same, King Richard couldn't even blink.<br>King Richard: "I'm not dead!?"<br>Man: "No, that was not my death hit, only my stunning fist, but if death is what you seek, you might want to feel the cold death of a Quivering Palm!" He hits King Richard.<br><br>The man draws out a piece of paper: "Hmmmm, 1.Climb a mountain, check, 2. Do laundry, check, 3.  Kill King Richard, check, 4. Brag about it, next step on the list. 5.

I like this build its unusual. Not many builds will be saving against stunning fist. The AB is nice once you use divine wrath (+59 I think, and in wilderness areas). Considering that most builds will fail their save aginast stunning fist I recommend replacing one of the improved stunning fist feats for EP or AS.

Heh heh, you noticed Zoodleton... Quivering Palm doesn't gets the ISF DC anyway, although it wouldn't be low since WIS is high, but you need 15 Monk levels for it, I was planning to have it (when I made the story) until I realized CoT gains ISF as bonus feat, and substituded a lot of Monk for CoT.<br><br>Alright then, I will change one ISF for Epic Prowess... although I think I won't take Armor Skin on this one, to retain DC as high as possible, but it won't matter if I don't hit...... However, changing 4 CoT for 4 Monk? I mean, sure, get Improved Evasion and more SFs in exchange of 1 feat, however, changing only 3 would get me the Improved Evasion and 3 SFs retaining 2 Divine Wrath's Power (if it gets used by chance) instead of 1 Monk AC.<br><br>I was thinking sometime after posting the build, there must and is a way to improve my base CHA so that I can use Divine Wrath. Maybe Great Wis V could be changed for Great CHA and use the last ability incresing point in CHA, to end with 12 CHA and 30 WIS, so that at least Divine Wrath gets to be used, +7 AB damage and saves are really worth it against 1 AC and DC, even if it's just one round.<br><br>Now...... wait, that was stupid, WIS 18 costs 3 points at starting level, I could start with 17 WIS and 13 CHA, I could leave the same amount of Great WIS, by getting Great WIS V earlier I would get 30 WIS at level 36 and use the last point on CHA to end CHA 14 WIS 30.<br><br>I'll need to remake the build with changes.... I'm not sure how much DC is affected, it will be high that's for sure, although I liked the DC getting over 60 buffed.<br><br>Thanks.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 04/29/06 16:42</span></i></p>

Well, I also like Improved Disarm and I've used it with draogon builds, pretty neat, you even get an attack of opportunity thanks to it because they end unarmed, as if taking their weapon wasn't enough, however, if I already make awesome stuns, and have IKD, ID probably won't be so important...<br><br>I know some enemies are immune to paralysis...

Why do you go from 18 to 19 dex?  Your forms will override it.  Even while leveling up, you'd not benefit from it much.<br>More Wisdom might be a bit better.  Or perhaps you could drop inital dex to 17, and pump up Int a few notches for extra skill points.  Then take that first stat buff for 18 dex.<br><br>I'm guessing that while you level up, you might be using the animal forms (all of which override dex).  So I do not know why you start off with 18 and increase it to 19.

Hmm, I scripted a dragon with a very similar level split (actually, this is one of the alternatives that I propose); it's a bit different but not worth a new post, I don't think.  <br><br>This one takes better advantage of the dragon ability bump (but forgoes ISF) and takes 8 CoT levels pre-epic for the AB.  27 Base AB.  And it will save against the highest of Dev Crit DC, which is hard for a dragon build to say.  It also has useable divine wrath to maximize the Improved Disarm chances.

You sell out a lot to get that Dex to 19 for the ISF line of feats.  A CoT without Charisma takes one of the most ravaging feats - Divine Wrath - and puts it on the sidelines.  A level 20 CoT adds +9 to his attack bonus for 1 round/charisma bonus.  Or three rounds.  It's a one shot deal, but for a disarmer, one shot may be all that is necessary.  And mine will have a DC in the mid 50's on its stunning fist (10 + 19 (str bonus) + 20 = 49 + 6 Str buffs/equipment = 55).  <br><br>Cheers, Tyr and Thax.

Well, I don't want to sound like I like more my build just because I made it, but you just can't replace them in such a post... your dragon is nice but way far from my idea of superb Stunning Fists, this is the best way I could think of to attain inmesurable DC with a decent AC and AB, I've tried and any other attempt lets the DC or the stats lower, granted, that this isn't one of the strongest looking dragon, but it's quite ok.<br><br>Now, sorry to bust you Ithacan, but your dragon gets a much lower DC, since it calculates WIS and not STR, (dragon's base STR is 48 vs your base 32 WIS does make a difference) your base dragon's Stunning Fist DC would be 41, which is effectively good and reliable but nowhere near my base 54, the second version I posted already lowers DC for quite an improvement in combat vitals, but I wouldn't sacrifice it much more. With a base DC of 54, buffable to 58, only a class combination with plenty of CoT or high charisma Paladin or Blackguard can resist it (dragons are also good at the saves btw),  and obviously RDDs which are immune, Stunning Fist himself is quite good at resisting it though, being a dragon with lots of CoT, almost any other combinations already failed the save, stun lasts for 3 rounds, and renders them prone if I'm correct, should be easy to maintain any enemy stunned until death unless their AC is too high.<br><br>I appreciate that you try to improve it though.<br><br>Sorry TyrTemplar, but the dragon seat is already occupied... he would not let anybody other than me ride him... I get jealous.<br><br>It's nice to see the old ones still get some attention, thanks Ithacan.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 01/30/07 03:28</span></i></p>

Exactly right, Thax - imagine my frustration when I hit the Build Search to see if posting my new dragon was worthwhile to post only to find yours there with almost the same level split but a different tack.
