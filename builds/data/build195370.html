<b>Playable from level 1 - 40 ..PvM or PvP Build</b><br>....<b>( Duel Kukri )</b><br><i>(Although a bit difficult to play until you gain Weaponmaster levels)</i><br><br><br>I tried making this build with 5 goals: Epic spells, Dual-Wielding with kukris, Automatic still spell III, 7 Weapon master lvls and Devastating critical. After first trying a ranger/wiz/wm (Which got everything but auto-still spell 3), I came up with this one and because I'm enjoying it a lot on the pw I play on, I decided to post it here.<br><br>Race: Human<br>Alignment: Any<br><br>Starting stats:        <br>Str: 16                <br>Dex: 15                <br>Con: 10                <br>Int: 16                <br>Wis: 8                 <br>Cha: 8                 <br><br>Ending stats:<br>Str: 26<br>Dex: 15<br>Con: 10<br>Int: 19<br>Wis: 8<br>Cha: 8<br><br>Stat points:<br><br>All stat points in strength<br><br>Level progression:<br>Level 1-2   Fighter<br>Level 2-8   Wiz<br>Level 9-12  Fighter<br>Level 13-19 Weapon Master<br>Level 20-39 Wizard<br>Level 40    Fighter<br><br>Feats:<br>Lvl 1:  Weapon profiency exotic, Weapon focus Kukri, Power attack<br>Lvl 2:  Cleave<br>Lvl 3:  Dodge<br>Lvl 6:  Great cleave<br>Lvl 7:  Still spell<br>Lvl 9:  Expertise<br>Lvl 10: Mobility<br>Lvl 12: Spring attack, Whirlwind attack<br>Lvl 15: Improved Critical: Kukri<br>Lvl 18: Ambidexterity<br>Lvl 21: Great Intelligence I<br>Lvl 23: Great Intelligence II<br>Lvl 25: Two Weapon Fighting<br>Lvl 27: Improved Two Weapon Fighting<br>Lvl 28: Great Intelligence III<br>Lvl 30: Overwelming critical: kukri<br>Lvl 32: Automatic still spell I, Epic weapon focus kukri*<br>Lvl 35: Automatic still spell II, Automatic still spell III<br>Lvl 39: Epic spell: Epic warding**, Devastating critical: Kukri<br><br>Skills: On level 5, max intimidate<br>        On all levels, max tumble<br>        On all fighter/weapon master levels, max discipline<br>        On all wizard levels, max spellcraft and concentration.<br><br>This will leave you with 99 skill point which you can spend whereever you want.<br><br>Strengths:<br>Lvl 9 wizard spellcasting and Epic warding<br><br>Devastating critical<br><br>Casting in full armor, thanks to automatic still spell III<br><br>Huge threat range (10-20 or 55% of the attacks threatening a critical hit) due to 7 weapon master levels, improved critical: kukri and the mage spell keen edge.<br><br>7 attacks per round with haste<br><br>Weaknesses:<br>Low caster level, which will make you unable to kill creatures with high sr with your spells.<br><br>Low spell DC, so you will have to focus on spells without a save<br><br>Moderate hit points. <br>26 wizard levels * 4 =          104 hp<br>7 weapon master levels * 10 =   70 hp<br>7 fighter levels * 10 =         70 hp<br>Min +2 to con due to endurance= 40 hp<br>---------------------------------------<br>Total hp:                       324 hp Minimum<br>This will be reasonable for a caster, but bad for a fighter.<br><br>Misc.

Is the fully buffed ab including true strike?<br><br>Otherwise you have a problem hitting without true strike. But i like the build. Must be quite versatile. <br><br>Only wondering if your ab makes the kukri worthwhile (Do you still hit with rolling a 10?)

I know it takes away from the idea, but I'd rather go for a two handed weapon with that build - for one thing it saves you three/four feats and would be way better against creatures with DR.

PvM won't be a problem with this build, since you can use spells vs. damage reduction enemies.<br><br>Also, the only thing you want to use melee for is to get dev. crits. Thye damage won't be great whether you use a longsword or kukri's (You'll lose 2ab as well when using longswords.)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Joeri1989 on 05/17/05 11:24</span></i></p>

It seems odd to start Dex at 15 and end it there, too.  You have two attributes (Dex and Int) that end in odd numbers.  I understand intelligence but would still avoid it.  Seems to me that you only need 14 dex for the build to work.  And that is worth 2 ability points somewhere else because of the pointbuy system.

15 dex is needed for Ambidexterity(Or two-weapon fighting, can't remember which one)

Hey, could this build work with a longsword focus instead of kukri? I was wondering that you could use Tensers Transformation and you'd have a better ab (i think...). I've been trying a build like this with focus on enchantment and then trying hold monster and then changing into tenser and finishing him off with the devastating critical. You get the high dc for it but i guess you lose automatic still spell. Just a thought!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Dennis05 on 06/01/05 03:08</span></i></p>

Compared to the kukri wizard, you'll lose the need for two-weapon fighting feats(3), but you'll need spell focus feats in enchantment or whatever school your main disabling spell will be. This will be possible without losing Auto-still III I think, but your dc on disabling will never be really high due to your 19 int.<br><br>Worth a try though. I'd like to see what the resulting build would be.
