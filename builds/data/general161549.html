I have just started playing on the PW, Valley of Shrouds. Its an original content low magic world. The classes have been reworked to encourage balance and cooperative play. Leveling is very slow and party based. Out of the 20+ average player base there are about a couple of diligent characters on at any given time who have reached epic levels. Basicly I am looking to find a build which does not require me to be epic to be useful in a party.<br><br>I am new to NWN and D&amp;D in general. I have gotten the basics of how the game works but cannot for the life of me make a viable character build. Here is what I am looking for:<br><br>Human<br>Druid(RP)<br>Fighter(extra feats)<br>Monk (speed/AC/unarmed)<br><br>I would like to be able to brew and craft wands. Use a longbow effectively without sacraficing unarmed if possible. Please.. No builds that require me to shift to be useful.<br><br>Please PM if you would like to discuss further.<br><br>Thank you in Advance! Shanda

So the wizard would have advantages here, they are powerful when the other classes don't have defenses against them. If it was heavy magic world, magic-based characters would be at disadvantage.<br><br>Anyway, it would be recommended that you do some combination of Wizard for high lore (especially that they have spell that boost their lore skills), Rogue for more skill points and they use spot and listen skills I think. If you want to have third class, it would be recommended that you add in Palemaster because they have immunity against criticals. If you were to encounter any characters that uses criticals, it would come to be useful. But if the level progression is slow... it might make some difference because you can get it at fourth level if you meet all requirements. Except that you would not be able to get immunity to criticals until you have 10 levels in palemaster.<br><br>I don't have level progression for what I suggested. But I have done a build like this one time long ago, but it has been while since I have last used it.<br><br>The reason for the combo of Wizard/Rogue/ and possibly Palemaster is that they have ability to sneak around and use the magics. They can cast the magics, and sneak around again after they are seen. It is good tactics, and sometimes it annoys the others... lol. And if I am correct, the world would not have any items that grants True Seeing, is that correct? If that is true, then this build would be strong in that world. Palemaster is only taken to give you immunity to the criticals.<br><br>Anyway, the suggestion above is based on my preferences.<br><br>Others would have better suggestions than I have. But at least you have option.<br><br>I hope that this is helpful for what you need.<br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Anuis on 10/28/04 00:28</span></i></p>
