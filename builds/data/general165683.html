I'm trying to build something similar to a ftr/Cot/rogue build, only that mine has sacrificed weap specialisation for even greater saving throws and divine might/shield. Charisma based build of course. <br><br>I'm thinking it'll have the starting attributes like this:str 14 dex 10 int 14 wis 8 cha 16<br><br>It'll surely take only 5 paladin lvls. I'm somehow confused about the other classes however.. I'm thinking 19 rogue and 16 CoT but I'm not sure..<br><br>If I take the classes like this, the feats will be(I might forget something..) Pow attack, Cleave, Great Cleave, Knockdown, Impr Knockdown, Toughness, Blind Fight, Impr Critical, Weap Focus LongSword, Epic Weap Focus LongSword, Divine Shield, Divine Might, Extra Turning, Extra Smiting, Armor Skin, Great Charisma I, Great Charisma II, Great Smite I, Great Smite II, Impr Sneak Attack I, Impr Sneak Attack II, Impr Sneak Attack III, Impr Sneak Attack IV, Crippling Hit, Impr Evasion or Defensive Roll <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif"> <br><br>The skills could be discipline, taunt, heal, search, spot, tumble, use magic device, persuade  maxed, and 5 skill points are left..<br><br>I might try to take some CoT levels later, so I won't take great cleave that is not so good, and take another epic feat, great smite 3 maybe..<br><br>It's a warrior build, no stealth, it uses rogue levels for the skills(tumble <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif">  )and skill points, and of course for the sneak attack(14d6 with the feats), quite usefull with impr knockdown. It'll have full plate, so I don't think it needs extra dex, mabe it could use 12 dex, but I'd have to do some replanning then, probably I'll drop great cleave then, and I'll try to get great charisma III..I'm waiting for suggestions and opinions on skills feats, everything... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><br>_________________<br>The past is a ghost that haunts you, from the moment it exists, until the moment you don't...

Bard would appear a happier combination with Paladin/CoT than Rogue. Plenty of Skills too (UMD, Tumble, Spellcraft, Taunt, Perform, Discipline), but will get use out of a high Cha.<br>_________________<br>My other char's a Bard.

The only problem with bard is they can't be lawful, so you would be dealing with alignment shifts.<br>_________________<br>Come visit the Epic Builders Guild for all the character info you could ever want or need:<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Changing alignement from neutral to lawful, could prove to be a bit difficult. Well, the bard is indeed also cha based, but he gets less skill points, no sneak, no evasion.. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">  Plus I'll have to take the auto still spell feats if I want to cast through heavy armor. Anyway, if I was to use the bard, it would probably be a bard/cot/rdd combination. As for the great cleave feat, is it worth getting? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif"><br>_________________<br>The past is a ghost that haunts you, from the moment it exists, until the moment you don't...

^<br><br>Mostly when playing against hordes of weak enemies you can finish off in a hit or two, then it works fine. But those enemies are easy enough not to worry about, so it's not great, IMO. If you've got something else that could be useful, take that instead.

Great Cleave is needed in a Dev Crit build. Otherwise it's not much use.
