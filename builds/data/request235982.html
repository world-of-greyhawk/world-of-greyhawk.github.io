I wish to create a melee sorcerer, the main idea is to specialize in Scimitar, use the spells : Keen edge, greater magic weapon, and flame weapon, to create a nasty scimitar, as well as using sorcerer spells to buff yourself before combat, and put on your full plate and tower shiend and run in. Also use feats like divine might and divine shield to get great AC and AB. Any ideas? Must have 3 fighter and 3 blackguard, trying to get the divine feats ASAP.

You mentioned 3 Fighter and 3 Blackguard; are you wanting the rest in Sorcerer or are you just looking for a minimum in those 2 classes?<br><br>Or perhaps a better way of asking: How many levels of each class are you looking for?

At least 3 fighter and at least 3 blackguard, sorry for any inconsistensy. Actually, 4 blackguard would actually be needed to get both Divine Might and Divine Shield. Everything else will have to be sorcerer to take advantage of the powerful buffs like Flame weapon, keen edge, and greater magic weapon, not to mention goodies like stoneskin which will help keep the melee going.

Thanks, except for :<br><br>15 Sorc (7) - Divine Shield<br><br>I thought you can't take the feats except with a blackguard level?

Divine feats? buffing? you're talking about a melee character, to improve BAB without feat trouble, just take one Sorcerer levels pre-epic, to allow you to take the spell feats, use a BG 10 / Sorc 1 / Fighter 9, this way, you'll get a bonus BG feat at level 23 for EWF and a bonus epic fighter spell at level 24 (with fighter 10) for EWS, 29 BAB, more pre-epic feats from fighter, and take the rest as sorcerer to gain spells, to end fighter 10/ BG 13 / sorcerer 17, it would get a more late spell progression but a better AB. You can also gain the same epic feats with a Fighter 12 / BG 10 / Sorcerer 18 If you don't need 17 or 18 sorcerer levels, then take more fighter levels, you can easily take Armor Skin, Epic Prowess or something else, or even try dev crit, that would need 3 extra feats for great cleave ov crit and dev crit, leave the CHA boosting until the end and you get it.<br><br>Oh, change that DEX, no feat uses DEX 12, and you can use cat's grace to buff DEX, so using a full plate it's probably better to keep it at 8 and start CHA 16<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 04/06/06 17:19</span></i></p>
