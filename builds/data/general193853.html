I was recently told that Blind Fight doesn't work at all. Not for melees or ranged. I was under the impression that it only worked for melees and not ranged but I was told otherwise. I really like the re-roll becuase of concealment feat so please someone verify this.

It definitely works, I did quite a bit of testing with epic dodge and self  concealment and blind fight to check out how good they were. Blind fight definitely works for melee. <br><br>Blind fight only works for ranged if you are close enough for blind fight to work. If you are too far away then blind fight doesnt work.<br><br>My first tests with ranged blind fight showed that it didnt work, simply because I was too far away for it to take effect.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!
