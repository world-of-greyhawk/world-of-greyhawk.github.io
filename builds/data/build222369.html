<b>Playable 1-40 in PvE</b><br><br>May have some trouble soloing without summons/henchmen... character has relatively weak defenses and a low discipline skill until level 40.<br><br>This character was designed to make an "all out" arcane archer who nonetheless got uncanny dodge and some useful skills.<br><br>Half-Elf, Non-Lawful<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 17<br>Con 12<br>Int 14<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 13<br><br>1 Rog (1): Point Blank Shot<br>2 Bar (1):<br>3 Bar (2): Weapon Focus (Shortbow)<br>4 Bar (3): +1 dex<br>5 Bar (4):<br>6 Bar (5): Called Shot<br>7 Bar (6):<br>8 Bar (7): +1 dex<br>9 Rog (2): Rapid Shot<br>10 AA (1):<br>11 AA (2):<br>12 AA (3): +1 dex, Improved Critical (Shortbow)*<br>13 AA (4):<br>14 AA (5):<br>15 AA (6): Blind Fight<br>16 AA (7): +1 dex<br>17 AA (8):<br>18 AA (9): Toughness*<br>19 AA (10):<br>20 Rog (3): +1 dex<br>21 AA (11): Epic Weapon Focus (Shortbow)<br>22 AA (12):<br>23 AA (13):<br>24 AA (14): +1 dex, Great Dex 1, Epic Prowess+<br>25 AA (15):<br>26 AA (16):<br>27 AA (17): Great Dex 2<br>28 AA (18): +1 dex, Great Dex 3+<br>29 AA (19):<br>30 AA (20): Great Dex 4<br>31 AA (21):<br>32 AA (22): +1 dex, Great Dex 5+<br>33 AA (23): Great Dex 6<br>34 AA (24):<br>35 AA (25):<br>36 AA (26): +1 dex, Great Dex 7, Great Dex 8+<br>37 AA (27):<br>38 AA (28):<br>39 AA (29): Great Dex 9<br>40 Bar (8): +1 dex<br><br>* - Optional Feat<br>+ - AA epic bonus feat<br><br>282 skillpoints - Discipline, Tumble, Spellcraft are musts.  At level 20 (rogue 3) I recommend Set Traps, at very least - disable and open lock can also be quite useful though not critical.<br><br>Ending Vitals:<br>Dex 36<br><br>AB +59 with mundane shortbow, +15 damage<br>(Char sheet will show +58, epic prowess makes +59)<br>2d6 sneak attacks<br><br>AC 31<br>378 max hp<br>F 21 R 38 W 18<br><br>FAQ:<br><b>Q:  You say this character has questionable playability solo without henchmen... why?</b><br>A:  Because this character relies on keeping a distance from the enemy, and the long stretch of AA levels (from 21 to 39) prevents you from raising many important skills (such as tumble and UMD).  You also go from level 9 through level 39 without being able to raise discipline.<br><br><b>Q:  Why use a shortbow?</b><br>A:  Because you don't get longbow proficiency before your first AA level in this build.<br><br><b>Q:  Why not be an elf?</b><br>A:  To avoid an exp penalty and increase playability.  If you want to pop this build out at level 40, or don't care about exp penalties, being an elf has some advantages - longbow proficiency is one, and a dex (for another AB and AC point) is another.<br><br><b>Q:  What's this build's strong point?</b><br>A:  Pumping out ranged damage like there's no tomorrow.  The rogue levels are for uncanny dodge (admittedly this is put off till level 20 for skill dumping reasons) but you also pick up 2d6 sneak attacks to add on top of your +15 enchanted arrows.<br><br>Being able to cast some bard spells, having UMD, and getting at least some trap-setting skills are very useful, however.  They can help you keep the bad guys at a distance and give you more chances to generate sneak attacks by providing summons, movement-restricting spells and traps, and escape spells.<br><br>Buffs for concealment, haste, AB, etc are all good plusses as well.<br><br><b>Q:  Besides the long stretch without discipline, what are the drawbacks?</b><br>A:  Low hitpoints, terrible fort and will saves, and lack of melee capability.  This is a ranged-only build and while you have excellent AB and damage with your shortbow, you are quite vulnerable to melee and magic attacks.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.
