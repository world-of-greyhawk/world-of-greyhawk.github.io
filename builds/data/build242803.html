If you move up ICC or AS you can take DS at 36th charcater level, no biggie but earlier is better anyhow. <br><br>What else to say? The build was cool before, now it's even cooler.

To get dragon, think he'd have to go shifter 29, take dragon shape, and only needs 5 druid to go there. This would leave room to boost monk levels to i.e., 6, for some neat monk feats. This would lead to good melee, now that the monk is in here, but it would greatly detract from his combat spells, which are pretty awesome, and many different damage types. (but Kail, construct is good for melee, too <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>Was just a thought <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">   This rak, as-is, is very cool! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Robert Tyr on 06/04/06 18:13</span></i></p>

You just need Druid 14 or Shifter 10 (which implies Druid 5 at least) and WIS 30 for DS. You can take the feat leveling up as a druid or shifter only, both as a general feat or as a bonus feat.<br><br>The actual requirements are Wildshape 5x or Greater Wildshape IV plus WIS 30.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Wait for me Dragon, we'll meet in the sky<br>By fire and magic, I'm sworn<br>Hell is calling, we cannot be denied<br>Fly to the blackness of the Storm<br><br>We must die to be reborn!

Depending on just how highly you value the extra speed, 28 druid/10 shifter/2 monk might be a good option for another feat.<br><br>If you're willing to sacrifice some constitution you could take one less great wisdom, increase it normally at level 40, and take dragon shape with your last bonus feat.

I see you drop druid at lev 11 and don't pick it up again until lev 22.  But the wild shape forms improve greatly at lev 12, am I recalling that correctly?  Why not pull one more druid lev.  12th druid is a BAB-gaining lev as well.

Wow Crit, how many years can pass before the time limit on the spell "resurrect thread" is finished? <br><br>Just kidding around, but on the real, Finn probably wanted to increase the early playability of the build with the monk WIS bonus to ac and discipline skilldump. Both make shifting into bears and whatever a much easier proposition.<br><br>Your probably right though, the endgame of the build would benefit from holding off until the epics to add monk.

No I was talking about adding a druid lev pre-epic, but not at the cost of the monk lev, but rather a shifter level, so shifter 9 would come at lev 22.<br><br>As far as the age of the post, in this forum, I think it's good to post to old builds.  Why not help to refine them?  And along the way, some may be found to be nullified by later patches and so forth.<br><br>Also, one more shifter lev (to 11) and one less Druid lev (to 26) give the build either undead or construct shape.<br><br>And, if the build doesn't switch out, say, toughness for KD, then it will be a dragon that can't KD, correct?  (Or does dragon shape get KD free?)<br><br>Do most people use empowered in Rak form or maximize?  If empowered is just as desireable, then blind fighting could be in there too.<br><br>When facing spell resistance - with the ice storms - do the druid + shifter levels add together for rolling against the SR?

You need to be on a feat level and be shifter level 10, it's impossible to get 25 WIS below level 24 unless you're a Champion of Torm or an Epic Druid, both options won't do, so he's basically taking the Rakshasa as fast as possible.

Blind-Fight is also a good thing to have, personally, I think Empowered is better than maximized, but I'd actually drop Extended. What I believe is Finn made the build too centered in the Rak shape, since the dragon appears way too late, that's why there's an early focus to Improved Expertise and the offensive combat feats are long forgotten, but to change that is very acceptable IMO.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 02/22/09 04:52</span></i></p>

Whatever class you have that can actually cast ice storm or Mestil's acid breath has their levels count for the spell resistance and damage of spells if you put your normal, empowered, and/or maximized spells from that class on the toolbar before shifting. Shifter levels don't matter since they can't cast the spells.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Malignant Manor on 02/22/09 08:17</span></i></p>

So this build, specializing in Rak/ice storm, will roll against SR with d20+26, correct?

The basic toolset has a max of 32 SR so you might want to fit in at least spell penetration and greater spell penetration. They don't stack so you will only get a +4 bonus but that guarantees 31+. This is of course, mostly a pvm guideline.<br><br>1 less druid level means 1d6 less cold damage on ice storms. Dragon shape doesn't get knockdown as a bonus.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Malignant Manor on 02/22/09 10:29</span></i></p>

Thank you, Thax, for answering for me. Indeed I made this build focused on Rak shape. It's not a bad tweak to take some melee combat feats - build to taste.<br>_________________<br><i>Ghaash agh akûl - Nazgûl skoiz<br>Mirdautas vras!<br>Karn ghaamp agh nût<br>Shaut Manwe quiinubat gukh</i><br><br>Summoning - Mirdautas Vras
