I know Rogue/Fighter/Wizard builds have been done to death, but I can't recall having seen one that got Epic Dodge, Epic Warding, and Epic Weapon Spec all in the same build.  This build does that, and still manages to get decent AB, AC, and HP, as well as the ability to dual-wield.    <br><br>Rogue 13/Wizard 21/Fighter 6<br>(pre-epic Rogue 12/Fighter 4/Wizard 4)<br><br>Race: Halfling (or Gnome)<br><br>Halfling gets +2 Dex, Gnome gets +2 Con<br><br><br>Stats:<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 18<br>Con 14<br>Int 16<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 8<br><br>+2 Int first to max skills points, the rest into Dex<br><br>Ending:<br><br>Str 10<br>Dex 28<br>Con 14<br>Int 19<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 8<br><br>Feats:<br><br>1 Dodge<br>3 Weapon Finesse<br>6 Exotic Weapon Prof.<br>9 WF: Kukri<br>12 Toughness OR Metamagic (Extend/Empower/Max.

He gets a ton of skill points, and his damage is decent even without sneak attacks.  With Haste and ITWF he gets 6 attacks per round, and with Imp. Crit. and Keen Edge he has a 45% chance of landing a critical every hit.  With an empowered Cat's Grace + True Strike he can get an AB of 60+ without too much trouble, and with Epic Warding he's virtually immune to physical damage.  <br><br>With 21 Wizard lvls and Epic Spell Pen. he can easily beat the SR of any monster in any of the campaigns, although he might have some trouble against pure Monk builds in PvP.  All in all he's an extremely versatile character with very few weaknesses, and he should be a blast to play.

Is there a build order in there anywhere?<br><br>You take Epic Warding at level 36, yet you say you have 4 levels of Wizard pre-epic; you are not an epic caster at level 36; you are level 20 at best.  Actually, you are level 19 at best, since taking EWS at level 24 implies you had a Fighter level there.<br><br>So is this a tested build?<br>_________________<br>Normal kids play rock-paper-scissors.<br>Shifter kids play IronGolem-RustMonster-MindFlayer. . .

Since you won't be able to take Epic Warding at 36, you'll need to take Epic Dodge at 36, and then take Epic Warding at lvl 39.  <br><br>Build order:<br>(Epic)<br> <br>21-23 Wizard<br>24    Fighter<br>25-35 Wizard<br>36    Rogue<br>37-39 Wizard <br>40    Fighter<br><br>The only issue with this is that you may lose a point of AC because you can only get to 39 Tumble at lvl 36, so if the bonus goes by ranks in Tumble rather than the modified score, your AC would be 1 point lower than I posted in my build.

Also, if you're taking Epic Dodge at 36 rather than 39, you would have to make sure you were a Halfling; Gnome wouldn't work due to the fact that his Dex wouldn't be high enough by lvl 36.  I suppose Elf could work, but then your Con is lower and you lose the Small Stature trait, which grants you +1 to AB and AC.
