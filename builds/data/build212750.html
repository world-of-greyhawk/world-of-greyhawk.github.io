Continuing with the ideas from christian.schnabel's request for an anti-assassin build, I came up with something this. This is a refined version of what I posted on his topic. A fairly unique and versatile character which dual-wields and uses a two-bladed sword which hopefully, counts as a large weapon when using Disarm. It probably rates poorly as an overall melee character due to the fairly poor HPs but it should do nicely against said sneaky types <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  .<br><br>Race: Elf<br>Alignment: Lawful Good<br><b>Straight level 40 PvP build</b><br><br>Stats:<br>STR: 16(26)<br>DEX: 15<br>CON: 12<br>INT: 13<br>WIS: 12(14)<br>CHA: 8<br><br>01: Ranger(1): Power Attack, Favored Enemy: Humans, R: (Dual Wield)<br>02: Ranger(2)<br>03: Ranger(3): Weapon Proficiency Exotic<br>04: Ranger(4): STR+1, (STR=17)<br>05: Ranger(5): Favored Enemy: Halflings<br>06: Ranger(6): Weapon Focus: Two-Bladed Sword<br>07: Ranger(7)<br>08: Champion of Torm(1): STR+1, (STR=18)<br>09: Champion of Torm(2): Ambidexterity, Cleave<br>10: Ranger(8)<br>11: Champion of Torm(3): CT: (Smite Evil)<br>12: Champion of Torm(4): STR+1, Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Critical: Two-Bladed Sword, (STR=19)<br>13: Ranger(9): R: (Improved Two-Weapon Fighting)<br>14: Ranger(10): Favored Enemy: Elves<br>15: Champion of Torm(5): Blind Fight<br>16: Champion of Torm(6): STR+1, Great Cleave, (STR=20)<br>17: Champion of Torm(7)<br>18: Champion of Torm(8): Toughness, Disarm<br>19: Champion of Torm(9)<br>20: Champion of Torm(10): STR+1, Improved Disarm, (STR=21)<br>21: Champion of Torm(11): Great Strength I, (STR=22)<br>22: Champion of Torm(12)<br>23: Champion of Torm(13)<br>24: Champion of Torm(14): STR+1, Great Strength II, Epic Weapon Focus: Two-Bladed Sword, (STR=24)<br>25: Ranger(11)<br>26: Ranger(12)<br>27: Ranger(13): Overwhelming Critical: Two-Bladed Sword<br>28: Ranger(14): STR+1, (STR=25)<br>29: Ranger(15): Favored Enemy: Dwarves<br>30: Ranger(16): Devastating Critical: Two-Bladed Sword<br>31: Ranger(17)<br>32: Ranger(18): WIS+1, (WIS=13)<br>33: Ranger(19): Epic Skill Focus: Listen<br>34: Ranger(20): Epic Prowess<br>35: Champion of Torm(15)<br>36: Ranger(21): WIS+1, Bane of Enemies, (WIS=14)<br>37: Champion of Torm(16)<br>38: Champion of Torm(17)<br>39: Champion of Torm(18): Epic Fortitude, Armor Skin<br>40: Monk(1): STR+1, M: (Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist), (STR=26)<br><br>NOTES: Rangers cannot choose normal Ambi and TWF as feats so the earlier levels were timed so you'd get CoT levels on the general feats and CoT CAN choose those feats (with 9th level ranger straight after for free ITWF xD). Later also, BoE must be taken as a general feat; It's not a Ranger bonus feat. Therefore if you're modify the build and juggle levels around, you'll have to take the 21st Ranger level when you get a general feat and take BoE as a general feat. I changed one of the original classes from Rogue to Monk and the ESF to Listen since monk doesn't get Spot as a class skill but you can still choose ESF: Spot if you choose since Halflings get Skill Affinity: Move Silently only. This leveling order should not get an exp penalty until it reaches level 40 (and there's no levels above 40 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  ). If you don't like monk, you can still choose Rogue and take ESF: Spot instead (or find some other class with Tumble as a class skill for skill dumping) and you could also pick up UMD. Wielding a two-bladed sword is unique and hopefully, it counts as a large weapon for using Disarm.

Why are you taking Dual Wielding feats when the Ranger gets them for free? Is it so you can Dual Wield in Medium Armor?<br><br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br><i>This space for rent</i>

Yup. It's a STR-based Ranger. I know you can hit 27 DEX max with DEX boosting items and Cat's Grace to use leather armor but you can't rely on that.

Aaaaah I thought you couldn't take Weapon Proficiency: Exotic at first level because I'm not used to playing fighter types but rather the 3/4 BAB classes (druid, rogue). In that case then, get Power Attack later. Any suggestions on further refining the build? If you're going to drop the normal dual-wielding feats and rely on dex-boosting items, I'd take the initiative feats or maybe great fortitude given what this build is designed for. Also if you want to endure an exp penalty for level 39-40, put the monk level back one and take ESF: Spot if it's more useful (probably is).

Lol <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  I've found that if you don't have some concept/task to build around, it's harder to make a build but you can't do too much well. Does anyone have suggestions for improvements? It occured to me you could also use bard as a last level choice and max spellcraft and tumble but that means non-lawful alignment and wasn't the character's intention.
