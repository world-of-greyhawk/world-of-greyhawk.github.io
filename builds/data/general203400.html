This is probably a really dumb question, but for someone who <br>1. Does not know how to do it or<br>2. Is a dweeb<br>it is a legitimate one.<br><br>So my question is: how do you put a table in when you submit your build to the list.<br><br>The rules say you have to, so I need to know before submit any builds.

I use a Trainer Mod, and Notepad to generate my character builds, one level at a time.

I made my own excel sheet for this. If you have a good understanding of excel or a similar program and you don't mind spending a bit of time with it, I recommend that. This way you get a tool that is completely customized for <i>you</i>.<br>If not, the <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.Detail&amp;id=856" target="_blank">Character Build Calculator</a> made by Kamiryn is a good option. It gives a rather nice output format, but I personally prefer my own <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">

Thanks dudes but what i want to know is how to make a link to it in the forums like everyone has. Do you have to upload it to the web site? Do you email it to the guild. I actually have some tables made up i just want people to be able to see them.
