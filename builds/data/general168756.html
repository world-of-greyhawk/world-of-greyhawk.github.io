Just something I was looking for and came up blank, is knowing what character level a build will receive feats.  Does someone out there have a list of eg (this is likely wrong, just an example of what I mean):<br>Character_ Level; Class; Feats Type<br>1; All; General<br>1; Fighter; Additional<br>2; None; None;<br>3; BoogerFlinger; Missile<br><br>Well, you know what I mean.. some kind of detailed guide to what character levels the standard + prestige classes get their feats on.

I'll check.. I seem to remember the description was kinda vague though.. something like every x levels class x gets feats.. then in build testing it didn't ever work out that way.  But I'll have a look again, thanks for the fast reply.

I appologize...<br><br>I just looked through the grimoire and what I was thinking about was the chart that lists your BAB,Saves,Feat Progression,etc from level 1-40. Close, but this aint horseshoes <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_look.gif"> <br><br>~E~<br>_________________<br>It's not a bad partnership.

If what you are asking, i believe the answer is this.  You get feats on lvl1, then 3,6,9,12,15,18,21 etc<br>You get stat increases 10 times on lvls 4,8,12,16,20..etc<br><br>Fightrs get extra feats  lv 1,2 then every second lvl 4,6,8,10 (even numbers).<br><br>Wizards get bonus magic feat on 5,10,15,20<br><br>CoT get even lvl bonus to 10 (2,4,6,8,10)<br><br>Post epic (20 or 10 for prestiges) each class gets its own bonuses. <br><br>Hope this helps<br><br>Peace
