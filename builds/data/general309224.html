Kail, what many fail to see is that the Red mage from FF isnt really a wizard at all, but an even better incarnation...  THE CLERIC!!  Throw in a longsword and away you go!  The whole idea of wiz/cleric or sorc/cleric is one i have toyed with for YEARS.  Back in my PRC days i did the teng build as cleric/wiz/eldrict knight.   PRC is so much better to get red mages, not cuz of rwot, but clerics gain access to ALL epic spells they can qual for (ward, ema, storm mantle, etc).  <br><br>Agin, the only issue i have with this style is the way you have to make it.  Going to epic, you really should be epic!  Getting 4hp per lvl isnt!  Getting lv 2 or 3 or 4 isnt.  Having to wait until lv 36 to gain epic spells, isnt epic.  In my humble opinion, while this is a GREAT idea on paper, translating it in a 1-40 environment isnt what i call fun.  But what do i know.  I only spent 2.5 years trying to perfect this concept.  I even attempted to mix cleric and wiz levels!  THat now means you are even wimpier going into epic!  LOL<br><br>It can be done, but in the end, you really need Mystic Theurge to do it correctly.  That PRC class is insane!  You would have lv 36 caster lvl in arcane and divine, and you could get Dev crit vs dev crit with 17 div and 23 arcane caster lvl!!  <br><br>I dont mean to drown your hopes!  I am routing for you to come up with a "playable" red mage, but alas, in vanilla nwn, i cant see it happening  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"><br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted <b>06/23/04</b> 21:16 (GMT) -- Anuis<br><br>Suolucider, Blitz 04, <b>avado</b>, Quisition, Boourns, ... welcome to the guild!

It's not a necessity to use the PrC. A red mage is supposed to be able to cast both healing and offensive spells as well as stand ground in melee, supposedly a merge between a white mage and a black mage spellsword-type. In Neverwinter Nights, a pure Cleric can actually do that, he's got healing spells, buffs, and offensive spells, even instant death spells such as Implosion, which would be defined as a black mage spell per se. Well, just taking Cleric is kinda cheap, so an all-range spellcaster such as a red mage would make sense being a caster that can use both divine and arcane spells, the adaptation works in that sense, divine spells are the white spells and arcane spells are the black spells.<br><br>Also, a red mage is supposed to be worse than a white mage when it comes to healing, worse than a black mage when it comes to spellpower and worse than a fighter when it comes to damage dealing, or else it would be overpowered and it would make no sense to have all four classes, since Mystic Theurge breaks that balance, it's also cheap.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 05/26/09 21:24</span></i></p>

Hey sword!  Its been awhile.<br><br>The "red mage" has nothing to do with color of the mage!  It is from the Final Fanatsy series.  THe red mage is a caster that ISNT as powerful as a Black mage (a pure wizard or sorc) and can heal, but not as well as a White mage.  There is no absolute in nwn.  Many of us have tried to do a cleric/wizard or cleric/sorc split to have BOTH div and arcane spells at lv 9.  <br><br>The inherant problem becomes spell DC and spell resistance.  How can you get enough levels in each to make that worthwhile, and, how can your buffs last long enough without being dispellable by a meer apprentice caster?  In the end, after many many many many hours of thought and trials, you cannot do both, and have a "good" character.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted <b>06/23/04</b> 21:16 (GMT) -- Anuis<br><br>Suolucider, Blitz 04, <b>avado</b>, Quisition, Boourns, ... welcome to the guild!

If he wants to believe that cleric/pm/rdd is doable, DONT discourage him!  IF he WERE to figure it out, i would reload nwn IMMEDIATELY!   I truly dont understand why bioware, in all its wisdom, decided to NOT allow cleric access directly to PM and rdd. I mean, it is, after all, the worst class in the game.  BAD skill set.  NO bonus feats.  WORST feat in game with Turn.  Probably the worst spell set of pure casting classes.  And dont even get me started on how crappy the spells are!  I mean, no massive damage spells! No Shields!  No insta-death spells like Wail or Weird!  *sigh<br><br><i>*edit (LOL  isnt it amazing when you look at a something with a different mind, how you CAN make an argument for or against it!  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">   ) </i><br><br><br>k, i am truly sorry about that rant.  Of course its full of *(it.  I just really wanted to make a cleric/pm10/rdd10 before i retired.
