Looking to build something similar to the Monk25/wiz5/PM10 build; but with more focus on mage levels [sorc or wiz; pref wiz if PM route is taken as scrolls would be needed].  Basically the Monk levels should be added as a melee-enabling enhancer; making it a kind of spellsword with monk capabilities [speed/attacks/etc].  As there are no good armor items available; Epic Mage Armor is a must; as is Epic Warding and any buffs possible like ShadowShield and Grtr StoneSkin.  The character should be able to buff their weapons early on as there are very few decent (read: anything +1 or better) kama's available that he can get while still standing.  Equipment is not guaranteed; however minor items like +1 soak 5 robes are readily available; as is a few basic weapons.  <br><br>Would be best to be able to wield a Kama mainhand and a Kukri offhand (if the offhand weapon is ignored for monk bonus attacks; seems this is correct can anyone confirm?) at early stages [pre lvl10].  Would be nice if some rogue were added in for sneak attack but don't think there is any way in all nine hells to get that right.<br><br>I'd appreciate any help or guidance on this one; as I've been racking my brain for some time over the mage balancing <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_confused.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 11/08/04 11:10</span></i></p>

Also; can't get my hands on any haste items easily or immunity items.  Dev Crit is disabled on the PW; but the other crit feats are not.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Khandahr on 11/08/04 16:53</span></i></p>
