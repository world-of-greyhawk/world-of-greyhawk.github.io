Alright guys,  I am look for a great PvP build in a high magic setting.  When I mean high magic,  +7-10 weapons,  helms of trueseeing,  ect.   I am looking for a great ultimate evil build that can excel in a pvp world.  The guy you love to hate.  The arch bad guy, the guy that can charm your socks off before he rips your throat out..  Just thinking over the rp aspect, I would imagine he needs to have some BG in him,  but if any of you creative guys have an alternative speak up.  I am really looking for a melee rp build that can kick arse.  Str build are welcome,  I don’t hate dex,  but it always seems so half commited to be a dex bad guy.

For PvP, be an arcane caster or die to someone who is.  However, assuming you want something for melee, here are some ideas:<br><br>If there are a lot of scrolls available, be a Rogue 10/ Fighter 8/ Blackguard 22 or Rogue 19/ Fighter 8/ Blackguard 13.<br><br>If scrolls are in absence, Bard 16/ Fighter 5/ Blackguard 19 is probably preferable.<br><br>Have you considered being the cleric of an evil deity?  Cleric 26/ Bard 4/ RDD 10 is pretty nasty to most, though I prefer Cleric 26/ Rogue 13/ (SD 1 if Dex based, Monk 1 if Wis based, or Fighter 1 if Str based).<br><br>What about a strength based Assassin?  Maybe Fighter 9/ Rogue 2/ Assassin 29, or thereabouts.<br><br>Bard 16/ Fighter 8/ PM 16 or Bard 20/ Fighter 4/ PM 16 gets good AC, epic spells, and should be pretty hard to kill if you don't mind having a lowish AB.<br><br>Any of those what you're looking for?<br>_________________<br>(I enjoy writing parenthetically (a lot)).

+10 Weapons make Clerics look worse and WMs look better; I'd go for a WM heavy build. Especially if scrolls are easily available for buffing through UMD.<br>_________________<br>"With Europe liberated, the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil, the United States of America [...] We taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom."<br><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/trailer.php" target="_blank">Star Wreck</a>

Now a assasin build says evil.  Possible a Str&amp;Cha built assasin with a little Bg mixed in for divine might/shield and ab pre epic.  I guess the same could be said of Bg and WM mix.

Personally I'd go a fighter heavy Blackguard with a little rogue for skills; say F10, BG25, R5.<br><br>High strength, high Cha, with all the main combat feats for good measure.  You can get an epic fiend; high taunt, tumble, and discipline; and solid smites and sneak attacks.

@ 4SakN:<br><br>General consensus seems to be, and I agree, that Epic Toughness is a wasted feat which should only be taken if nothing else is available.  Rearrange leveling order to take Epic Weapon Focus as a Blackguard Bonus feat, and drop two fighter levels in favor of rogue to solve the problem.  Also, start Str 14/ Int 16/ Cha 14.  The net gain is 18 extra skill points, 1 more to AB &amp; damage, and 1d6 extra sneak attack, all at the cost of just 40 HP.<br><br>One more thing, the Epic Vrock is one of the better summons of the game, and I've built around it before, but it probably won't last long enough to be worth burning a feat on in a high magic setting.<br>_________________<br>(I enjoy writing parenthetically (a lot)).

Epic AB is not affected by Classes chosen. I don't get how he can increase AB by lowering STR either, but start with STR16, INT14 and CHA 14. Ditch persuade-points. This was just an addendum to the previous suggestions.<br>_________________<br>We are sons of Odin, and the fire that we burn inside<br>is the legacy of warrior-kings who reign above in the sky<br>I will lead the charge, my sword into the wind<br>Sons of Odin fights to die and live again
