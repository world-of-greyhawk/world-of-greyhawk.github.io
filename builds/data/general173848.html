ok came up with a 20 monk 15 rogue 5 champion of torm idea, and wanna build this one very well.... So of course i need major help guys!  I play on a server that limits skill points so no savin em up, and you can only put one point on a skill per level.(except first char level)  The five Torm levels give the 4 attacks per round taken at 16-20, and if possible, i would like to play this as a halfling dual kama wielder.  Wouldnt mind changing levs around a bit, but my monk has to stay at 20(faction rule).  The way I have tried this build, i dont see the kamas as making sense, and with the size penalty for unarmed strike, that lets halfiling out too... Anyone show me the best build for this kinda critter.  And how bout the best build on the halfling idea too?  Thanks guys, you rock..   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   guess i should add that my server has up to and over +5 items, but 3s are totally getable as are haste items.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Sidious Fell on 01/05/05 03:08</span></i></p>

k, after looking through builds, none fit with the classes im thinking, but it looks like more cot is gonna make sense, and really i dont mind, with the rogue i was basically looking to add the sneak damage. (not that the rest  isnt nice ) Im really thinking of the halfling dual wielder.  Wanna roleplay him as a ultra devoted kinda crusading behind the scenes kinda overlooked dude... K think thats about it, except a high ab is almost a must with this one. thanks again guys.
