I think this is a finely done build!  <br><br>But, since I never use summons, is it worth it to have these 2?  Can you use them at the same time?

IMO both feats are a waste of time since the non epic shadowlord is stronger in melee than the epic shadowlord. Neither pet has enough levels to make any real difference in battle.<br><br>Syrath<br>_________________<br>It's <b><i>SHADOWDANCER</i></b>, dammit, <i>shadowdancer</i>!!!

It's probably better to have one high in levels, than two weak to mediocre ones.  This would also translate into having a stronger Bard, with stronger buffs, more buffs, longer lasting, and a better Bard/Curse Song.  You might consider going more Bard and SD, drop BG altogether(and perhaps replace with Ftr or CoT), and then buff your Epic Shadowlord with Improved Invis spells you gain from from Bard.<br><br>Also, it might be wiser to start with an 8 Wis and put those two points into Chr and Str.  <br><br>But a dex-based Bard/SD is going to need to find a way to generate damage from somewhere.  It makes for a good defensive build, but it might be more useful to take Fighter over BG since you gain about 5 feats, increase damage output, and allows you faster progression for your Bard levels.  The only thing the BG is really contributing in this scenario is a stacking Bull's, and that ability is limited.  At least weapon specialization would be on all the time.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

actually bard sds get very low saves , so bg is a good choice to boost up saves especially fort. <br>the extra divine dmg is more worth it imo since divine can rarley be resisted.another point is that bg gets sneaks what s great if combined with sd.<br><br>i would cahnge to 19bg and 10 sd only , going wihtout the epic summon and get 1d6more sneaks.
