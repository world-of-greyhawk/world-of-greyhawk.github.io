OK, I'm looking for a Bard that ends around 25-ish.  <br><br>Here's what I'm looking for strategy-wise:  <br>- Bard Song<br>- Curse Song<br>- Buffing Spells<br>- Greater Spell Focus: Enchantment - using spells like: Hold Person, Mind Fog (then perhaps, fear or curse), confusion, Tasha's,  etc.<br><br>I don't really care whether or not it is strength or dexterity based (although Dex-based might fit better with the spellcasting aspect).  <br><br>I thought about putting Harper Scout in to boost spell DC's (Eagles splendor spell and potion stacking), but it is both feat and skill draining.<br><br>Has anyone tried a build like this? I've tried fleshing out the bare bones of if, but it is hard to fit all the feats, and skill requirements together in a way that would level easily.<br><br>Here's the *rough* draft of a Dex-based version, but I'm obviously not sold on it.<br>Elf<br>Str 12<br>Dex 18 (25)<br>Con 12<br>Int 12<br>Wis 8<br>Cha 14 (16)<br><br>1 Bard (1) - Alertness<br>2 Bard (2)<br>3 Bard (3) - Weapon Finesse<br>4 Bard (4) - Dex 19<br>5 Bard (5)<br>6 Bard (6) - Iron Will<br>7 Bard (7)<br>8 Bard (8) - Dex 20<br>9 Harper Scout (1) - Empower Spell, Curse Song*<br>10 Harper Scout (2)<br>11 Harper Scout (3)<br>12 Harper Scout (4) - Spell Focus: Enchantment, Cha 15<br>13 Bard (9)<br>14 Bard (10)	<br>15 Bard (11) - Greater Spell Focus: Enchantment<br>16 Bard (12) - Cha 16<br>17 Bard (13)<br>18 Bard (14) - Extra Songs<br>19 Bard (15)<br>20 Bard (16) - Dex 21<br><br>21 Harper Scout (5) - Great Dexterity I, Great Dexterity II<br>22 Bard (17)<br>23 Bard (18)<br>24 Bard (19) - Great Dexterity III, Dex 25<br>25 Bard (20)<br><br>So, would it be effective? <br><br>I know that the spell DC's won't match a dedicated spellcaster, but I was hoping that the Harper Scout abilities would make up for it.<br><br>Any thoughts?<br><br>Is the concept viable, or am I daft?  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">

Very nice, good use of HS levels. The build concept is quite interesting, I considered such a build reading G_u_s's post about caster Bards on the NWN General Discussion forum. Never got around doing it, though... Well anyway, I'd make him CHA based with a level (or three, even four <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_shades.gif"> ) of Paladin for the obvious benefits. I'd keep HS, so maybe Bard 16/HS 5/Paladin 4. I don't think you'll be able to get enough Perform for higher level Bard Songs at level 25. Just and idea anyway.<br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm

You'll probably find Extra Songs of little use when taking 20+ levels of Bard. I'd opt for something else more critical to the build, that you may have a need for.<br><br>Maybe delay HS until epic levels to preserve BAB also.<br><br>Need to time your 20th Bard level to coincide with a feat selection so that you can pick Lasting Inspiration as well.<br><br>Epic Skill Focus: Perform would be of necessity if going for 21 or higher Bard levels, otherwise your song may never reach its full potential.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By I...Samphus on 03/01/06 16:54</span></i></p>

Thanks for the replies...<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 03/01/06 16:52:13 (GMT) -- I...Samphus<br><br>You'll probably find Extra Songs of little use when taking 20+ levels of Bard.

I had originally thought to take it to help out at early levels, but by lvl 18 their isn't much need.  Perhaps Blindfight or Toughness would be better.<br><br>I was worried about the higher level Perform requirements and thought about taking a skill focus, but I the main reason I was taking 17+ levels of Bard was for the 6th level spells and spell duration.  I suppose I could drop a skill focus in place of Extra songs, though.  But the point of diminishing returns seems to be Bard song lvl 16 (Perform req. 30). I should be able to hit that with normal Cha bonuses and Perform levels and perhaps some gear.<br><br>Good food for thought.

I'm not sure how easily I can switch alignments, though, which makes me a little hesitant to build it in.  And of course the XP penalty.  I could go human, though my initial AB might suffer with a lower Dex.  Perhaps Strength-based Human. The extra feat would cover Still spell.<br><br>Thank you for your suggestions.  I'll try a test build in a leveler and see what happens.<br><br>Cheers.
