<b>SILVANITE SHADEWOOD MISTRESS</b><br><br><i><br>The Forest Father attracts from all corners of the globe: those with a deep connection with nature. The Church of Silvanus has defended woods and forests from the encroachment of civilization for many thousands of years; and the war continues behind the scenes. <br><br>Having accumulated a great deal wisdom from her adventures, a lone Silvanite druid reasons that deception is essential in the ongoing secret war between silvanites and the industrious. An old and anonymous shadowdancer introduces her to the way of the shadow...<br><br>"...where there is light, there is a shadow...where there is no light, there exists a myriad of shadows...but even the most infinitesimal of shadows can hide a mountain..."<br><br>Being wise and young, she learns quickly. The shadows bend to her will...they shield her...encompass her...even as she summons ancient draconic spirits to mold her body into that of a thousand year old dragon, the shadows blend and adapt...<br><br>The Church of Silvanus counted her amongst the greatest of their assets...she blended into the shadows like the oaks of Shadewood...she became the Shadewood Mistress.<br></i><br><br><br>...essentially she's a HIPsing druid/dragon. This is more of an in-depth guide (and advertisement) for a generic dragon build. Hard to come up with something original for a seven year old game...<br><br><br>Similar Builds<br>Bertuzzi's Sneaky Dragon: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "305180", "15", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Jehoshua's Universal Dragon: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "226851", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Talamier's Nature's Defender: <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "232903", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br><br>I'm sure you've seen or thought of this sneaky little dragon. Moreover, she's a HIPsing caster with powerful spells; with spell penetration and DCs almost at the level of an exalted sorcerer.<br><br>Even if you corner this girl with a large party, she dies hard. As a dragon she has high HP, high AC, good AB, high saves, high spell resistance, etc. etc. As a druid, she's a powerful spellcaster. You wouldn't want to be caught by both stonehold and storm of vengeance; even if you're immune to paralysis, she can cast harm on you as you enter the storm...'nuff said.<br><br><br><br><b>SHADEWOOD MISTRESS - DRUID 36 / MONK 2 / SHADOWDANCER 2</b><br>Human, Lawful Neutral<br><i>Playable 1-40 PvM<br>PvP Untested</i><br><br><br><br><b>ABILITIES(ending)</b><br>STR 8<br>DEX 14<br>CON 8<br>INT 14<br>WIS 18(34)      <br>CHA 10    <br><br><br><br><b>BASIC STATS</b><br>Hit Points: 280<br>Skillpoints: 305<br><br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 22/35/22<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Evasion<br><br>BAB: 23<br>AB: 25 (melee), 25 (ranged)<br><br>AC (naked): 34<br><br><br><br><b>SKILLS</b><br>Concentration 42, Discipline 40, Heal 21, Hide 44, Move Silently 44, Persuade 43, Spellcraft 45, Tumble 44<br><br><br><br><b>LEVELING GUIDE</b><br>01:Druid 1: Dodge, Mobility<br>02:Druid 2<br>03:Druid 3: Extend Spell<br>04:Druid 4: WIS +1 (WIS 19)<br>05:Druid 5<br>06:Druid 6: Maximize Spell<br>07:Monk 1<br>08:Druid 7: WIS +1 (WIS 20)<br>09:Druid 8: Combat Casting<br>10:Druid 9: <br>11:Druid 10: <br>12:Shadowdancer 1: Knockdown, WIS +1 (WIS 21)<br>13:Druid 11<br>14:Druid 12 <br>15:Druid 13: Spell Focus: Conjuration<br>16:Druid 14: WIS +1 (WIS 22)<br>17:Druid 15<br>18:Druid 16: Weapon Finesse<br>19:Druid 17<br>20:Druid 18: WIS+1, (WIS 23)<br>21:Druid 19: Armor Skin<br>22:Druid 20<br>23:Druid 21<br>24:Druid 22: Great Wisdom 1, WIS +1 (WIS 25)<br>25:Druid 23<br>26:Druid 24: Great Wisdom 2 (WIS 26)<br>27:Druid 25: Great Wisdom 3 (WIS 27)<br>28:Druid 26: WIS +1, (WIS 28)<br>29:Druid 27<br>30:Druid 28: Greater Spell Focus: Conjuration, Great Wisdom 4 (WIS 29)<br>31:Druid 29<br>32:Druid 30: WIS +1 (WIS 30)<br>33:Druid 31: Dragon Shape<br>34:Druid 32: Epic Spell Focus: Conjuration<br>35:Druid 33 <br>36:Druid 34: Great Wisdom 5, WIS +1 (WIS 32)<br>37:Druid 35<br>38:Monk 2<br>39:Shadowdancer 2: Blindfight<br>40:Druid 36: Great Wisdom 6, WIS +1 (WIS 34)<br><br><br><br><br><b>DRAGON FORM</b><br><i>[Buffed values in brackets]<br>Owl's Insight, Barkskin, Aura of Vitality, Extended Spell Resistance, Maximised Bull's Strength</i><br><br>STR 48 [57]<br>DEX 36 [40]<br>CON 32 [36]<br>INT 14<br>WIS 34 [46]<br>CHA 10 <br><br>Spell Resistance: 20 [48]<br><br>Fortitude: 34 [36]<br>Reflex: 33 [35]<br>Will: 35 [41]<br><br>AB (claws/bite): +46/+40 [+50/+44]<br><br>HP:  860[940]<br><br>AC: 63 [76]<br><br><br><br><b> Spellbook </b><br>Storm of Vengeance<br>Maximized Inferno - Cast then hide and run<br>	Extended Aura of Vitality<br>	Extended Regeneration<br>Harm<br>	Energy Buffer<br>	Extended Spell Resistance<br>Stonehold<br>	Owl's Insight<br>	Death Ward<br>	Maximized Bull's Strength<br>Ice Storm<br>	Freedom of Movement<br>	Barkskin<br>	One with the Land<br>	Camouflage <br><br><b>Her Pros</b><br>Moan in agony as a building-sized dinosaur with a wingspan the size of an A380 disappears into the crimson sunset...even the best spotters and listeners cannot detect this girl!<br><br>A naked AC of 76 in Dragon Form ensures that only those with the craziest of ABs can hit her when she actually equips something.<br><br>'Spell Resistance' Buff gives 48 spell resistance; casters without at least 30 caster levels shouldn't even try...<br><br>Conversely, she has loads of spell penetration from her 36 druid levels...<br><br>Kinda hard to dispel her when she have 36 druid levels.

You're losing 2 AB by taking 1 monk and 1 shadowdancer level pre-epic.  You don't have Epic Prowess.  You took Blind Fight at level 39.

Combat Casting without ICC is just a wasted feat, BF comes way too late and Zen Archery is sorely missing. Depending on the environment I'd consider getting magic crafting feats. Monk and SD preepic are hurting AB but at the same time they can enhance early levels playability: to reach this effect one should get SD asap, in order to benefit early from HiPS (and immediately before that, consequentially, from WIS AC from Monk). Otherwise, given that a pure druid is pretty survivable on eshould postpone those levels into epic. <br><br>Regarding touch attacks they ignore all armor, shield and natural AC and their enhancements. Prismatic Dragons have their AC made up mostly of natural AC and so I suspect Dracoliches too, hence why you hit them very easily with a touch attack. To be noted that your Dragon too has a big chunk of his AC made up from natural AC (+12/+18 buffed) so beware yourself of youch attacks.<br><br>Regarding your SR, it just takes a Mord or a Breach to kill it, so beware of mages and of anyone equipped with a a wand of LSB.<br><br>Regarding your posting style, I suggest to be more essential.<br>_________________<br>They can't stop us<br>Let them try<br>For Heavy Metal<br>We will die

You are in good company with this build.  It reminded me of a TOUGH build a good friend of mine did some years ago.  The basics of his was 18 druid/ 2 SD and 20 monk, but we were using PRC rules and he had practised spellcaster:druid (+4 to druid caster) which gave him epic spells as well.  We loved the idea of a disappearing dragon!  <br><br>Keep up the good work.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted <b>06/23/04</b> 21:16 (GMT) -- Anuis<br><br>Suolucider, Blitz 04, <b>avado</b>, Quisition, Boourns, ... welcome to the guild!
