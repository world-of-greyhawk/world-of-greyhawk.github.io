I'm not sure I get what's the problem, you say you don't know what to take in epics, but you never said you're having difficulties with the build.<br><br>I'd try to get Auto Still 3 much earlier than level 40, it's a big boost for playability, so leave the Great Charisma for the end. Taking Improved Combat Casting is alright, IMO it's fairly decent not recieving Attacks of Opportunity. There aren't THAT many choices anyway, you're already set with a class distribution, so don't fret, ultimately you round up excess feats with Great Charisma, and it's always good to have high DCs. The class distribution is more important, Sorcerer 37 / Champion of Torm 2 / Paladin 1 is a no-brainer, you can't go wrong with a heavy caster, levels alone make you strong, so I don't really see why you're so obsessed about not being an uber builder, the build you describe sounds fine to me. <br><br>Once you have a good class distribution, even the best builder can only improve it so much as a few numbers here or there, +2 DCs, +1 saves, taking the most useful feats (which aren't the "only" valuable feats) in the best order and such. If you're having problems with a 37 Sorcerer then you need help using it, not building it, and that comes mostly from tough experience, you don't really learn how to play at a forum.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/13/09 04:50</span></i></p>

Looks good, SD, but it's tough to say for certain without knowing what your final attribute score in CHA will be (basically, don't end it on an odd number).<br><br>Yeah, Autostill 3 as soon as you can comfortably fit it in is good.<br><br>I'd consider dropping the two levels of CoT and grabbing one more SOR and a level of FTR. Gives you one extra SOR bonus feat, loses only +1 on all your saves, and you still get a bonus feat from the FTR level. As well, you don't have to focus in a weapon if you don't want to.<br><br>Anyway, it looks like a solid armored caster to me.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

Auto still is kinda cool isnt it ?<br><br>Is this DM guy just being a cows backside (you know what i wanna type there instead) or what ? <br><br>My gut instinct tells me maybe the head DM has a few brain cells missing.

I've no idea what the DM might have meant by that, perhaps auto still is disabled on that server (what?!)<br><br>And yes so long as you only wear cloth/light armor, Rangers get an ambidex/two-weapon fighting ability.<br><br>Although the usefulness of such a weapon would be limited to things that have exceedingly low AC, so it might be better off to dual wield weapons (or sword/shield) that add to your saves/skills/attributes

No Auto Still after 20? That seems to imply you can get it before 20, which you can't. It doesn't help anyone to be cryptic about server rules. Also, it's kind of a stupid thing to ban. Stick to the classics like Dev Crit and HiPS.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By whirlin_merlin on 03/14/09 02:46</span></i></p>

Yeah, DMs don't really have to be good builders. If you're taking Auto-Still, forget about Ranger and dual-wield, that only works with light armor, and man, you want Autostill for the exact opposite: wearing Heavy Armor and Shield. If you weren't aiming for armor then drop autostill, it's not a requirement for a good caster, but you're right, autostill it's a good thing to have.<br><br>Well, I thought you were into that class distribution for a reason higher than "some dude I met told me, and he's a DM so I thought he was smart". I'd drop CoT too, my caster build is Sorcerer 37 / Blackguard 2 / Paladin 1, IF you can make the alignment change (take level 1 as Paladin and start killing people while leveling Sorcerer until you can get Blackguard, it's a fairly simple shift), because that build gets real godly saves, not what a couple levels of CoT can grant.<br><br>He probably doesn't answer you anymore because it can be annoying to have people asking how to build inside the game (in this case, you). I would never go and start lecturing noobs on how to build <b>while I'm playing</b>, that's what the forum is for.

It's very hard to suck at casting powerful spells IMO, you just need to know which spells work and you're ought to find out with experience. Sounds to me like that DM got owned when he was using an Exhalted Sorcerer, and well, taking 2 levels of CoT is certainly not better than a level of Monk. However, with that kind of dialogue, I'm pretty certain he dislikes you now.<br>_________________<br>"My name is Thaxll'ssyllia, but you simians may refer to me merely as "Sir", if you prefer a less... syllable intensive workout."<br><br>Edwin Odesseiron - Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
