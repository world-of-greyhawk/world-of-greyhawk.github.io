Jack Altrades: Cleric 15/Fighter 14/Rogue 11<br><br>Versatility! <br><br>If you like your characters to be able to do a number of different things, as opposed to being a focused specialist, then this build may be for you. <br>Jack has the buffing abilities of a cleric, the fighting prowess of a warrior, and the skill set of a rogue. <br>Add to the mix some decent saving throws, sneak attacks, a devastating critical katana, and free healing spells, and you have yourself a fun, diversified build that can hold its own on most PW’s.<br>(If you play on a non-devastating critical world, I'd drop the power attack 'chase' for some saving throw boosts, Improved knockdown, and 2 more great strengths).<br><br>Unfortunately, there is an XP penalty. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">   <br>Feedback is appreciated!<br><br>Race - Human<br>Alignment - CG<br>PvM, Playable 1-40<br><br>Starting:<br><br>Str 16 (26)<br>Dex 8<br>Con 14<br>Wis 15 (18)<br>Int 14<br>Cha 8<br><br>Leveling:<br><br>01 Fighter 1 – Luck of Heroes, Toughness, Weapon Prof. Exotic<br>02 Fighter 2– Weapon Focus: Katana<br>03 Fighter 3– Knockdown<br>04 Fighter 4– Weapon Spec.

I am not sure why you would choose to take an xp penalty.  There is no need to.  What does fighter give that is worth the penalty?  6 damage?  Is that it?  <br><br>Oh, one extra feat (if you sub cot).  You could even take blackguard for a nice Evil character.   Maybe you have a reason.

I'd rearrange the levelling just a bit. Take some Rogue in pre-epic levels, preferably starting at level 1 as Rogue. This will get you extra skill points and also get your Rogue skills early so you'll have use of them all through the character's career. You could easily go CLC 12/Rogue 4/FTR 4 pre-epic and avoid any XP penalties up to that point (although you may have to rearrange feats). Juggling your epic levels a bit could probably allow you to avoid an XP penalty right up until level 39 or so. Just a thought. This class combination is very versatile.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

This reminds me of the Chaos Harbinger, which I adjusted to suit my tastes and to avoid the XP penalty until as late as I could.  By mixing in Rogue earlier you get stronger skills earlier on and you can push back the XP penalty, if not avoid it altogether.  If you go halfling, the XP penalty would be easy to manage with all of these classes in this proportion.  Redo the levels a little bit and then you've got a sure fire winner.<br><br>Or go Cot or BG instead of fighter.  Avoid the issue altogether.<br><br>-cs

Here is what I came up with for a CoT Version.<br>I can never decided whether chasing Dev Crit is worth all the junk feats involved.<br>Plus, a lot of PW's ban it also. <br>Is there a formula for when Dev Crit is worth while?<br><br>Anyway...<br><br>Cleric 15/Champion of Torm 14/Rogue 11<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "252898", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a>

Anyhow, to answer your question, if you sub 4 Rogue lvls for 4 Cleric lvls there's no loss of AB, but if you sub it for FTR you're gonna lose -1 AB, which is not yet enough to exploit Divine Power.<br><br>I'd go Cleric 10/Rogue 6/FTR 4 preepic for 15 BAB at lvl 20 and 3 apr to exploit DP, getting +3 ref save in the process, drop WP: exotic and focus in Scimitar instead (the extended crit range for a dev critter is much more valuable than the +2.5 avg dmg per hit plus you free up a feat). You could end with Cleric 15/Rogue 13/FTR 12 and get both CS and IE.<br><br>I'd invest more points in set traps, definitely. What's with that MS 1, Listen 1, Hide 1? Wasted skillpoints that have no use . Also, Tumble 40 is all you need.<br><br>I think War domain would be a better choice, permahaste gear is usually easy to get.<br><br>Finally, class levels are mandatory in the leveling guide and so is the playability range. I added PvM, playable 1-40 which should fit the build lemme know if you want it changed. Remember about these points next time.<br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "250334", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builds Posting Rules</a><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 09/15/06 07:42</span></i></p>
