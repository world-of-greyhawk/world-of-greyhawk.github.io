Melee build with an AB of 76 and a Dev Crit DC of 48 naked and buffed. No XP Penalty neither.<br><br>Race: Human<br>Class: 29 Paladin/1 Sorceror/10 RDD<br><br>Starting Stats<br>Str 18<br>Dex 10<br>Con 8<br>Wis 14<br>Int 11<br>Cha 11<br>Final Stats<br>Str 42<br>Dex 10<br>Con 10<br>Wis 14<br>Int 13<br>Cha 13<br><br>Lvl Progression<br>1-28 Paladin, +7 Str, Feats Taken: Power Attack, Cleave, Knockdown, Great Cleave, Weapon Focus: Scimitar or Rapier, Improved Critical: Scimitar or Rapier, Blind Fight, Toughness, Overwhelming Critical, Devestating Critical, Great Strength 1-3<br>29 Sorceror<br>30-39 Red Dragon Disciple, +2 Str, Feats Taken: Great Strength 5,6, Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar or Rapier or Imp Knockdown.<br>40 Paladin +1 Str, Epic Prowess<br><br>Skills:<br>Tumble: 20<br>Discipline: 43<br>Taunt: 43<br>Bunch of other skills.<br><br>Just in closing, this character was extremely easy to lvl and is very effective in PvM. Originally I had him as a Half-Orc but as a Human you sacrifice 1 AB from the loss of 2 strength, but you suffer no XP Penalty. With the Paladin buffs lasting a long time he is extremely effective in Combat, and his naked AC is 18 with tumble and the RDD nothing to sneeze at as a warrior, since with equipment it isn't difficult at all to push ac into the 70s with HoTU goodies.<br><br>So what do you guys think? Any room for improvement?

Also quite a lot of HPs. Another alternative is to switch Sorc for Bard to get a small bonus from the Bard Song...and if taken at level 29 you can pump Tumble to 30 easily for a +6 AC.

Guys, check the age of the original post. It's pointless to flog a horse that's been dead for so long ... It was from back when people simply didn't know any better ... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>-Christina!

Bard can add 2 ac  better saves with short song  maybe some umd to use scrolls, but you'll lose the benefits of true strike which is in my opinion more important in that build ( true strike , ikd , crits then dev <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> ). With your stats you could choose divine shield pre epic to add some ac on your build.<br><br>He'll have hard time vs hipser or invisible enemies but in pvm like vs  melee build he'll rock with hight ab  and holy avenger spell on weapon and a dever is always dangerous (you can roll a 1 at any time <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> ). <br>There's many pali sorc rdd here ( got one <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> ) maybe for pvp a better dev dc could be better.<br><br>Nice build cheers.

(That Tyr: such a busy g*d these days, such a shame that some of his followers may use this as an excuse to go astray <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif">    <br><br>anyway, I see that Pal/RDD/Sorc has been done, but as yet might be another angle . . . we'll see <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">   <br><br>Cheers, folks - (and, uh, that's not TyrPaladin, just a Tyr who happens to be looking at a Paladin build (sorry, but really, couldn't help the irony) <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evillol.gif">    <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_ignore.gif">   <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_good.gif">  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Robert Tyr on 06/01/06 21:45</span></i></p>
