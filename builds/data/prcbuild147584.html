This one does look like a ton of fun. I'll definately give it a whirl. How does it handle epic spells? I saw you are putting your skills there.

A couple things I noticed when testing this build. First you took epic spell focus, and it isn't available in archmage's selection. Wasn't a big deal as I swapped it for great int I.<br><br>Also what would happen if you brought this character into HotU official campaign? Would you just be fairly shapeless until the end of chapter one?
