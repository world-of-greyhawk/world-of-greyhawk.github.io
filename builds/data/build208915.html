The DR stacks, but you shouldnt count the monk ones. It is 20/+1, and lets face it, not one creature you are fighting is having less than +1 weapon at lvl 40. It helps against blade barrier, tho. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  I hadnt the time to look over the rest of your build, but since its not tested, I dont bother either <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_sleep2.gif">

A few things, and they mostly deal with pre-epic aspects.  You are going to want Weapon Finesse long before you are going to want Dodge and Toughness.  Until level 9, you are relying on just BAB and your 12 strength, and then subtract -2 since I assume you mean for him to be dualwielding when you pick up TWF.  Also, he has no way to generate damage.  You're not going to be turning anybody's heads with a 12 strength, and with no buffs, no sneaks, and no monk fists, he is going to have a very tough go of it.<br><br>I would also nix Mobility and Iron Will, which would both be trumped by your Monk Tumble and Monk's mind immunity.  Doing this would allow you to take ITWF much earlier(and net you an open Epic Feat).  I would also advise taking  at least 8 Monk pre-epic, if not more.  This will secure IKD for you, which he is going to need without anyways to generate damage.<br><br>Which is something we should get back to.  Generating damage:  if you are going to dualwield, then you are either going to want to be strength-based, or have some decent sneak attack or WM levels to generate nasty criticals.  Without these, he's a big target, and his AC isn't going to save him, nor will his hitpoints.  <br><br>Just some things to mull on.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 08/17/05 20:43</span></i></p>
