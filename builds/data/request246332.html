so it's end of pickpocket requests? Well, there has been this whole smiting orgie here lately so just take alook at some recent builds, or even the thread where we discussed it. I'm pretty sure you can find it, no? 1 sorcerer for true strike sounds nice, but isn't really doable, since you can't cast it in armour.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

Like Grimnir just said, there were a lot of smiting builds  posted recently.

If all you're looking for is a good Smite, then you just need high CHA and Pally/CoT. You could slip in the level of SOR if you want without too much problem (actually, I might suggest 2 levels for an extra casting).<br>_________________<br>This signature will self-destruct in 5 seconds...

Sorceror for the simple use of True Strike is pointless. +20 AB, right? Who cares. What does your Smite add to your AB? With a decent Smiter with some good equipment, your Smite will take you damn well near +20 to your AB. One level of an Arcane Class will not serve you as well as something like Rogue or Shadowdancer or Monk.<br><br>Things like Evasion from those classes will do nicely to your already high saves, and a skill dump in Hide/MS with HiPS may be useful. A maxed Tumble or UMD would also be very appealing for me. Much more than True Strike, especially when a scroll of True Strike would work just the same as the spell... so take Rogue or something. Evasion, UMD, Sneak Attack, Hide/MS! Way better! <br><br>As for the Smiting itself, if you take Paladin into Epic Levels until you get 25 Charisma, then go CoT 10 for Great Smite every second level and more, then finish off with Epic CoT for Divine Wrath and Saves with an additional Rogue level at 40... you will have a very solid Smiter with amazing damage output. Likely 1-Shot kills on a Smite.<br><br>As for what weapon you use, there is some controversy on that. You can use a Scimitar and end with a huge Critical Threat Range with x2 Multiplier. This will pretty much gauruntee a Critical which ~should~ butcher your enemy or at least leave them vulnerable for you to finish them off with a few hits. Some people though, prefer a smaller Critical Range with a larger Multiplier. I think Warhammer was the suggestion that I got, because it gets a x3 Multiplier and I think it ends with a 15-20 Threat Range. The reason people do not like the Scimitar route, is because even though you could threaten a Critical on a 12, that may not even hit your oponents AC, while the 15-20 Warhammer will. My opinion though, is that a Smite raises your AB into steller areas anyways... a Paladin/CoT heavy build will have a huge BAB and some good buffs with a +5 Weapon. With a Smite you should get your AB into the 80's (I think) which should hit anything you are going to face anyways, even Kail's weak little Jormungerfubble Dragonshaper (Cleric/Monk/Druid) so you mine as well go for the larger Threat Range. Unless your enemies have more HP than you have hairs on your body, then go for the Warhammer with x3.<br><br>Sory if I was not clear, I have a habbit of not always making sense.<br><br><br>P.S. Kail's Fuberjor Dragon would be Lawful Neutral so your Smite wouldn't work on it anyways... so yes... it would still whip you.<br><br><br>P.P.S. Kail, I just used your Munderfujor Dragon today and it made everyone leave and cry. Kudos to your build-oriented mind.

I never tried actually). Smite AB does not counts towards the cap, so it adds ok. And your AB can <b>never</b> be too high, count that each hit in the same turn recieves -5 AB, sure, maybe your first hit will always hit, but not all, never.<br><br>BTW it's called <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "225446", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Order of Jormundgandr</a>

As I said, Rogue is far better a choice. As is Monk. Perhpas not Shadowdancer.<br><br>Rogue gets UMD and can use True Strike scrolls, gets Evasion, Sneak Attack, Hide/MS, Tumble... <br><br>ITS BETTER!

Most probably yes, Rogue gets UMD for those true sight scrolls...<br><br>Bard can also be accounted, level 1 song gives +1 AB and damage, along with UMD, take Rogue if your DEX is high for Evasion, or Bard if it's low. I don't think he gets many skills for Hide/MS... 1d6 sneak isn't much, but with IKD it could get used...

He will have high Reflex. Charisma gets added and since he is Charisma based for Smiting, Evasion is a huge asset.<br><br>Better than Bard, even because the song will last for like... 5 rounds?
