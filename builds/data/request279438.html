STR-based? Stealther? Are there immunity to KD items available? What race/alignment? What items are available on your server (what's the magic level)? Is HiPS nerfed? Is True Sight nerfed?<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">

For sneaks I'd suggest this one: <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_roguearcher.html" target="_blank">Click Here</a><br>I play this on my PW, and tho ranged attacks there mostly sucks compared to melee (lots of magic weapons about, and hardly any magic arrows with a punch) it still rocks.<br><br>You could always drop point blank shot and rapid shot for finesse and something else to go melee.<br>Just keep in mind that to get ranged sneaks, you have to be within point blank range (15 feet).

I am truly surprised that anyone responded to this post!  You have to realize that Uber is in the hands of the player  not the character, necessarily.  I could hand you the ULTIMATE build for me, and you could mess it up because you dont know how to use it!   THat is the reality.  The OP, by the way he posted, is clearly not experienced with nwn.  Please, send some time playing the game then come back with an intelligently imposed question about WHAT YOU WANT in a build.  To say Uber sneaker!!  WOW!  Do you want melee? range? clerical? arcane?  Do you want imm to fear (shameless plug for my rog 29/pal build  <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  )   I know this is the build request forum, but the guild is Epic builders!  It assumes that you have some experience..<br><br>To answer your question though, the ULTIMATE sneaker is my pal/rogu!!  He HITS like a ton and has a decent amount of sneak (d14!).  In my book, thats UBER sneak<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/08/06 16:20:00 (GMT) -- Thaxll'ssyllia<br><br>I think avado answered your question like no other could... </div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End -->

I'd take an Epic Dodge DEX based Cleric 20 /Monk 1 /Rogue 19 just about anytime, I don't care if the sneak dice is not too "uber", the build would be stronger overall than just a Rogue with "uber" sneak attack dice.<br>_________________<br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 12/19/06 19:54 (GMT) -- FinneousPJ<br><br>Thax the Shadow Dragon sez: MONKS USE KAMAS.

A ranger21 assassin9 shadowdancer 10 has a fair amount of stealth ability even in a str based build, has potential for epic dodge in a dex build, has a fair amount of sneak attack and a good damage output with a broad range of favored enemies, a ton of defensive strength and perfect or near-perfect ab. There are also a stunning amount of players who dont account for HIPS in pvp. This also tends to be easy to level.
