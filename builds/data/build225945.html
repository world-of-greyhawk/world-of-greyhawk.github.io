Handaxe would net you +2 AB dual wielding at the cost of -2 DMG on average... I think I could live with that.<br>Besides that would free up a feat: maybe knockdown so one epic feat frees up (epic reflexes maybe to make evasion more useful).<br><br>Also, Overwhelming Critical adds +3d6 (you've got a x4 weapon)to your crits and it does not get multiplied, so on average it's +10.5 DMG only, not +35 (and +18 maximum). Crits with dwarven waraxe do 126 DMG maximum<br><br>Nice meleer, 50 AB is quite respectable and you've got dual wield open too! Overall, well done!<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>Dilegua notte<br>Tramontate stelle<br>Tramontate stelle<br>All'alba vincerò<br>Vincerò<br>Vincerò

Nice build.<br><br>I agree with the others, drop PA and Gr. Cleave to take KD/IKD early. Drop O. Crit for something nice of your choice in Epic, unless you are going for Dev Crit.<br><br>One thought - you could easily add some kama cheese to this build. At the cost of 1 AB, take an early monk level, and put the weapon foci on kama (it will +1 AB when dual wielding thanks to the lower penalty). Gets you 2 more attacks per round, plus flurry for a 3rd, all at the -3 progression instead of -5 (up to the max of 10 with dual kamas, flurry and haste). As long as you are taking 1 early monk level, you could also take up to 4 pre-epic, and 2 in epic to pick up KD/IKD for free, 1 point of monk AC, a bit of monk speed, and a few other goodies. Drop 4 fighter levels and you still gain 1 feat from picking up KD/IKD (granted, they will come late) for free and not needing to take exotic weapon prof. <br><br>If you don't want to lose the 1 AB, since you took Exotic anyway you could still focus on kamas, and take the monk level late. When you take it, you will suddenly switch to the monk attack progression. It costs an extra feat this way for the weapon prof, though.<br><br>Last thought - the only things you are getting from the monk levels are tumble dumps, cleave, and evasion. If you take 2 rogue levels instead, you will still get tumble dumps and evasion, plus UMD dumps as well. Burn a feat for cleave (one of the ones dropped above), and that might be very worthwhile.<br><br>TM<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Tattoed Monk on 01/04/06 13:58</span></i></p>
