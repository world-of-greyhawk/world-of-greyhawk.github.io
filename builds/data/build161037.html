I think I'll give it a try in a high magic mod that has few IM items except for Knock Down and Fear.  The greatest weakness I see if the AoO people will get due to no Epic Combat Casting, this will allow some serious damage/hits if the attack turns out ot be from a rogue (SA).<br><br>I pushed the AC and DC has high as I could without totally sacrifcing other areas.  If you dont have access to IM to KD items this build will really get pounded by high AB WMs so its best to hit them with some disabling spell asap.<br><br>Feed back?

The easy answer is for AC.  But really in the PW I'll be playing this there is some light leather armor (1 AC with max 8 dex bonus) that will work great for a Soc.  So the build is somewhat based on known items on that world.  Just as I know there will be IM to KD items around so I was not worryed too much about Displine skill.  Eather way AC is good, for the mage its DC and AC vs melee type needing AC and AB.

Power Attack is a prerequesite for Divine Shield.<br><br>About AC - isn't it better to drop dex to 12, improve con to 14 or int to 12, sacrifice 3 Great Charisma feats to get Automatic Still Spell III? This will allow you to cast spells in heavy armor.<br><br>Just a note - many people post stats of their characters with +12 items, which is a mistake - stats should be posted without any magical items, or at least with and without them.

"Just a note - many people post stats of their characters with +12 items, which is a mistake - stats should be posted without any magical items, or at least with and without them."<br><br>Good point, I'll try and keep that in mind.<br><br>On the auto still feats vs casting in robes.  Sure maybe if you want the lower DC.  The main focus is get it as high as you can while still getting good AC.  I think what you would be looking at is the best AC you can get and DC #2.  But as stated so much depends on the equipment in the mod your going to be usining it in.  The PW I'll be playing on is a high / mid magic world.<br><br>Test AC.  Assume +5 is the best you can get in gear, but with buffs you will reach +12 in stats<br><br>AC heavy plate and tower shield (but heavy!)<br>8 armor + 1 dex + 5 magic, +3 shield +5 magic=22 ac bump<br><br>AC with Dex and Wis Bump<br>+2 nat Dex +6 Dex bump - 1 Nat WIs +6 Wis bump=13 ac bump<br><br>Thats a 9 difference, enough for me to say yea go that way if thats your only option and you didnt mind the loss of 2 DC.  But with eather CEP craft armor (mitheral chain and Ironwood shield 0% spell fail), or on my PW with elfen leather and a large shield (again 0% fail) the numbers go back the other way I think.  Not as good as the Heavy Plate and Tower shield but close (+20) enought that it shouldnt matter.<br><br>I wanted to show a build with DC as the #1 feature, I know I dont know much in 9 months of playing but so many build (mage) seam to just ignore DC and do nothing but spam Maximized IGMS.  The mages *** about thier spells not working now that people can reach L40 but thier DC is something like 25 or worse.<br><br>Well I'm a AC nut so I can see a real benift to going with the auto still feats but I want to turn rogues to stone at the start of PvP and hit the fighters with one after another death spell untill they flop dead with interposting hand keeping thier ab at -10. Whats the normal save for a Figher/Rogue/WM build?  Just over 20 Fort save?  With this DC you should not fail that check very offen <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif">  .

hmm, level 24 says you take 2 great Charisma feats.. i tried the build out, only got one feat at that level.. then i realised its cause you arent epic sorc by then.<br>I took same feats all the way down, but i was shorted 2 Great Charisma's... is it possible you missed something? or was something wrong on my end..

Grrr.. this is the price I pay for doing this on a slow day at work and not at home!  Ok I went back and checked my build on the Novice to Epic Mod (great tester mod) and I had made a mistake in the sequence of feats taken.  Here is the proper list.<br><br>L21 Greater Cha 1<br>L24 Epic Spell Focus Necro<br>L27 Greater Cha 2 &amp; 3<br>L30 Greater Cha 4 &amp; 5<br>L33 Epic Warding &amp; Armor Skin<br>L36 Greater Cha 6 &amp; 7<br>L39 Greater Cha 8<br>L40 Greater Cha 9 (bonus feat)<br><br>The last monk level is taken at L38 for pumping tumble skill and that seperates the bonus and std feats at level 39 and 40 from being taken both at the same time as the others.<br><br>As pointed above on a high magic world you will get a better AC and only lose 2DC if you go the auto still I, II, III route.  I think there is a build like this way back on pages 4-6 (searched yesterday).  Ive also read were many think a DC mage = death.  Yes if your trying to solo that is true, but it you have some meatshe.. er dwarfs or other fighters in front to buy you time this build will snap all low to mid saving throw oppointes in half, I hope.<br><br>Saves are wrong, they are in the mid 30s but with SC at 40 you add 8.  So against spells your Save DC will be 40ish, otherwise closer to 33-36.<br><br>You end up with the same # and type of feats as above but I messed up the levels taken.  My mistake ... sorry.

Then the numbers would be 22 AC with armor and shield vs 18 with just stats and robes.   Only a difference of 4 for the loss of 2 DC.
