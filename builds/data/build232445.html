It also gives the Hawkeye a Stunning Fist DC of 35, that can be useful against low Fort opponents. <br><br>The Tormite Hawkeye also has a modified Spot rank of 60 and a initiative roll of +7, to help against sneakers. It has access to level 2 Ranger spells (Grease, Entangle, Ultravision, Cat's Grace, Protection from Elements). Even though the HP of the Tormite Hawkeye is nothing special, his high saves coupled with Improved Evasion and a basic SR of 22, an increased movement speed (140%) mean he can get out of most situations without much trouble. <br><br>As for the weapons, I chose the mace for the bludgeoning damage, but you could easily change it to your liking. Using kamas can be effective but is cheesy.<br><br>Pros:<br>Decent naked AC without uncanny dodge<br>Decent dualwielding AB<br>High saves<br>Improved Evasion<br>SR22<br>High Spot skill<br>Access to many combat feats<br>Stunning fist DC35<br>Increased speed<br><br>Cons:<br>No stealth skills<br>No trap-related skills<br>Average HP<br>Matures slowly, really shines only in Epic levels<br><br>Any comments or suggestions are greatly appreciated. There are chances I probably missed out on something while making this build due to the fact it was created in less than 15 minutes and without planification. =)

I wouldn't go Monk 12, it messes up your SR (it cannot be lowered/boosted).<br>_________________<br>The world is grey, the mountain's old<br>The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>The darkness dwells in Druin's halls...<br><br> ~ <a href="http://www.summoning.info/" target="_blank">Summoning</a> - Khazad-Dúm

Some ideas:<br><br>Using kama is a must for the flurry of blows, APR and AB, you don't need to change anything, just the WF, EWF and IC into kamas, but no change in feat order or anything. You are a ranger, so no problem going dual-wielding kamas. You may see it cheesy, but what's wrong with that? You might have considered this before, but it's just stronger than the mace.<br><br>If you are looking for low fortitude opponents, you can get to dev crit, change blooded for power attack and improved initiative for greater cleave and you're done cualifying for overwhelming crit and dev crit, you can take them as bonus CoT feats, say, instead of Great WIS, leaving a DC of 40 unbuffed and 46 with STR capped, which is higher than Stunning Fist, although you can't actually make it work whenever you want.<br><br>About the SR, true he can't boost it anymore, but this build has no way to boost it anyway, no spells, no UMD, nothing. But 22 SR it's still low, any strong caster will beat it.<br><br>Nice: IKD with ID, works really cool.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/04/06 02:07</span></i></p>

Good point about the SR, I never thought of that. About Dev Crit, I personally don't like to include it in my builds. It would be easy to fit in with this build, as the CoT levels give many bonus feats and I'd only lose some minor stuff, but I don't know, I don't like it.<br><br>The major flaw my Hawkeye has is with the damage output. Let's face it. IT SUCKS. Main hand is four attacks at 11-16 and offhand is two attacks at 6-11, for a maximum unbufed damage of 56 per round without magic items. Taking him into a leveller turned him into mince meat. With that in mind, I'll try to modify him, replacing the ranger levels for fighter levels to grab EWS or focusing more on the monk aspect and use unarmed.<br><br>I'll post the results later when I have time to fiddle around with him.

Well, 56 per round is sad, strong melee make more with one hit.<br><br>The damage with two weapons sometimes is weak, 56 per round can improve just with the kama stuff, a hasted dual wielding with 28+ BAB using FoB makes 10 APR, so it is much more than 56, you get enough ranger levels pre-epic for the BAB, so there is some.<br><br>Making powerful hits with two weapons is something hard, I multiclassed with a Blackguard for some damage without losing BAB, although it ended with almost no AC and HP, and anything immune to knockdown just beats him.<br><br>When thinking on how to add damage, I think a CHA based paladin/monk/fighter with EWS, Divine Might and Extended Divine Favor (at least, might use some other paladin spell) is a great addition that goes directly to damage on both weapons, then using the 10 APR with kamas, so it's a lot (although going CHA based instead of STR based increases damage at cost of AB), but I think those are too much changes on your build to say it's still the same guy. I need to make it myself to see how strong it actually gets.<br><br>But yeah, EWS will add +6 damage on both hands, which is undoubtedly very good.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Thaxll'ssyllia on 03/04/06 05:12</span></i></p>

Well Ab and damage-wise, I thought it was pretty funny that my build was better unarmed than with maces if I changed WF and EWF... Unless I'm mistaken it's:<br><br>Maces:<br>1d6+10/1d6+5<br>+40/+40/+35/+35/+30/+25<br>Fists (with flurry):<br>1d12+10<br>+40/+40/+38/+34/+31/+29/+25<br><br>Riiiiiiiiight uh?<br>Awright, this one needs MAJOR tweaking. I'm back to the works.
