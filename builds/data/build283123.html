<i>Defending against Evil and Adventuring PvM (1-40) and PvP </i><br><br><b>SHADOW SHIELD (Paladin Order, Arvoreen’s Marchers: Halfling Defender)<br>By Deborah “Tyr” Templar</b><br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;<i><br>Some say that the best defense is a strong offense whereas others insist that the opposite is true, namely, that the best offense is a strong defense. It is an age old question which has been argued by military generals and tacticians for eons, with this build being dedicated to those who believe in the “defense-first” theory, in order to determine if they’re right. </i></div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><i></i><br><br><br><b><i>Concept – Paladin-Rogue of Arvoreen (Halfling Defenders): The Art of Defense</i></b><i></i><br> <br>The Paladins of Arvoreen are a Halfling Order in Tethyr, known officially as the “Arvoreen Marchers” but also as Halfling Defenders, officially recognized by the Crown; a small but highly regarded order, Arvoreen’s Marchers are respected by humans and halflings alike. <br><br>Arvoreen is the Halfling God of War, whose portfolio includes Defense (Protection), Good, Duty (Law), and vigilance; his is a “Power of stern defense and aggressive watchfulness, who is always preparing for incursions into (H)alfling lands and making ready to repulse hostile creatures at the first sign of trouble.”  His primary worshippers are Halfling soldiers and warriors including battle clerics and paladin-rogues, who specialize in all matters of defense.<br><br>Arvoreen's dogma is best captured by the phrase: “The Best Offense is a Strong Defense,” and is as follows: <br><br>“Keep the community's burrows secure, and always be prepared for threats and attacks. Prepare an active defense, drill continuously, and leave nothing to chance. Put down danger before it even rears its head. Seek out allies, no matter how unorthodox. Those who give aid against a mutual foe are friends to be rewarded and trusted. Stealing from other halflings and allies is never acceptable, but thieving is not necessarily dishonorable, as long as it is employed against enemies to better the odds in combat later.” <br><br>The Arvoreen Marchers adhere to this dogma in a manner befitting the Code of Heironeous (see, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deities_of_Dungeons_&amp;_Dragons" target="_blank">Click Here</a> (“Paladin Code”), developed initially by and for another paladin order by the deity Heironeous with whom Arvoreen has close personal ties. As such, even although Arvoreen’s Marchers are a bit unorthodox as compared to most, seeing the Code as akin to a “living tree” which must be constantly adapted to the times as opposed to containing a bunch of rules frozen in time, the two paladin orders share a strong, mutual bond. Accordingly, Arvoreen's Defenders are protectors of halfling communities, “constructing defensive barriers, signaling systems, beacons, and traps, and reviewing defenses already in place…(Whereas m)any clerics organize the local militia, procure weapons for volunteers, and train every able-bodied halfling in the use of weapons and other defense strategies or at least in how to best seek safety, … Marshals regularly adventure to gain magical weapons and defensive items of all kinds.” <br><br>Arvoreen is an intermediate deity but a major Power in the Halfling Universe, being a child of (and subservient only to) Yondalla, the “Blessed One.” Yondalla is a major deity throughout all of Faerun for she is the Creator of the Halfling race and thus the Matriarch, Provider, and Ultimate Protector of all Halflings and their good-aligned/good-natured allies, being herself aligned closely with Corellon, Moradin, Tyr, Torm, Helm and Chanteau. Like Yondalla, Arvoreen smiles on followers who aid and protect those in need. He is likewise a LG deity, his favored weapon being “Aegisheart” (shortsword) and his symbol that of two crossed shortswords.  <br><br>Source: This information is excerpted and adapted from: <a href="http://nwn2.wikia.com/wiki/Arvoreen" target="_blank">http://nwn2.wikia.com/wiki/Arvoreen</a> <br><br><br><br>Pros and Cons:<br><br>• Excellent Defense: SC-5 (innate 50% self-concealment, which is permanent and secure – e.g., cannot be pierced via true seeing, nor purged, nor mord'ed, etc.) combined with Epic Dodge, Uncanny, HiPs and High AC (“monk like” with a shield). <br>• Good HPs (over 400 HPs, which is also really nice on a sneaker-heavy build) and Nice Saves (thanks to Paladin Spells, Immunities and Divine Grace), w. SC5 and UMD<br>• Very nice AB. Shield has a Natural AB 44 (self-buffed AB 57, +3 smite bonus), which is particularly good on a heavy sneaker build; with nice enough damage (i.e., 10d6 sneak bolstered by paladin spells, including holy sword, with HiPs, UMD and deadly traps)<br>• Albeit slightly feat-starved and more skills would (always) be nice (terribly thin as seen from the view point of a sneaker/rogue, but has what s/he really needs, and not so bad when seen from the point of view as a paladin), this is the price a Halfling Rogue pays in order to become a Holy Sword-Wielding SC-5/ED/HiPs Paladin Knight.
