"Your money or your life!" <br><br>The brigand grabbed the elf woman by the roots of her hair, and with a mailed gauntlet forced her to her knees.  Around the rest of the caravan, other figures leaped from the undergrowth and knocked the elven pilgrims to the ground.  These highwaymen carried weapons grim in nature-- heavy spiked flails, serrated swords, and cold, gleaming scimitars.  These were no desperate ruffians.  Murder was their business, and business was good, for they were well-armed and trained.<br><br>"Do as we say, and your lives will spared!" barked the leader who stepped slowly into the perimeter.  He was a huge man, if man he was.  He towered head and shoulders above even the tallest of the outlaws, and black leathery wings stretched out behind him as if he were some demon from the ancient world.  In his hands he gripped a Great Axe whose like had not been seen since the days of Nether, and his eyes were red, his countenance fell.  A wave of fear, palpable and menacing, throbbed around his being, and even his own men strayed not too close.  This was no ordinary outlaw.  He was Ardekzor, one of the feared Seven Fists of Gruumsh.<br><br>"Do not, and I shall elevate your suffering to an art form!" His sinister laugh reverberated throughout the canyon.<br><br>All around the caravan train, the people threw themselves to the ground and cowered and prayed for mercy.  But there was one who did not.  He stood alone, in the midst of it all.  He was short, perhaps 5 feet, but broad of back.  He wore no armour, and appeared unarmed.  He was clad in simple garb, mostly tattered rags of black and brown, and his face was obscured by the shadow of his cloak, which he had pulled over his visage.  He was still and silent, like a statue, and the brigands stared at him in disbelief.<br><br>"What? Are you the token deaf elf pilgrim?" sneered the closest bandit, "On your knees!"  He immediately made an attempt to grab the stranger's arm and throw him to the ground.  But in the moment that he blinked, the stranger sidestepped the brigand's clumsy attack and turned it back on him, and the man found himself face first in the dirt.<br><br>"I am no elf," the stranger uttered in a low voice of gravel.<br><br>  Three more brigands jumped at the stranger. Three more fell to the earth.<br><br>"Kill him," ordered Ardekzor, "Kill him now!  I want his head and all the rest of their heads on pikes!"  He had no sooner spoken this than the stranger suddenly was a blur of motion that the eye could barely follow.  He had produced a sword from the confines of his cloak, and from somewhere else came a shield, and in a dance that was half art and half macabre, he slew eight of the nine brigands who assailed the caravan.  The stranger then stood still as stone again and waited.  Next to him, the ninth bandit made a slight motion with his arm, looked to his leader in pure astonishment with a word perched on his lips, and then he, too, fell without a sound.<br><br>Ardekzor grunted and, blind with fury, charged the stranger with the Great Axe held high above his head.  The stranger, with minimal movement and effort, sidestepped his first blow and countered with two quick strikes that pierced the leader's abdomen, and then he simply vanished.  The leader whirled around in rage, sweat and blood running into his eyes.<br><br>"Come on and fight me!  Fight me you coward!"<br><br>And then he felt steel sink deep into the back of both his knees and he buckled and fell.  And then the stranger was before him with a long sliver of steel whose tip he jammed against Ardekzor's throat.  From behind the stranger, Ardekzor could see a blackness begin to swell, as if it were some stygian creature made of wings and shadow rise up from the ground.  <br><br>"Who are you?" he gasped, and he could feel the steel-tip slowly penetrate his flesh.  <br><br>"Your worst nightmare,"  the stranger whispered.<br>___________<br><br><b>PvM, Playable 1-40</b><br><br><b>Stygian Knight</b><br><b>Rogue17/Fighter10/Shadowdancer13</b><br><br>Race: Any (I chose Dwarf, though Elf/Halfling work best)<br>Alignment: Any<br><br>Str14<br>Int14<br>Wis8<br>Dex18(32)<br>Con12<br>Chr6<br><br><b>Level-ups</b><br>1Rogue1, Dodge<br>2Fighter1, Weapon Finesse<br>3Rogue2 Wpn Focus(shortsword, rapier, mace or hand axe)<br>4Fighter2, Mobility, Dex19<br>5Fighter3<br>6Fighter4 Wpn Spcl, Knockdown<br>7Rogue3<br>8Shadowdancer1, Dex20<br>9Shadowdancer2, Improved KD<br>10Rogue4<br>11Rogue5<br>12Shadowdancer3, Improved Critical, Dex21<br>13Shadowdancer4<br>14Shadowdancer5<br>15Rogue6, Iron Will<br>16Rogue7, Dex22<br>17Shadowdancer6<br>18Shadowdancer7, Blindfighting<br>19Shadowdancer8<br>20Rogue8, Dex23<br>21Shadowdancer9, Great Dex I<br>22Shadowdancer10<br>23Rogue9<br>24Rogue10, Great Dex II, Epic Dodge, Dex 26<br>25Rogue11<br>26Fighter5<br>27Fighter6, EWF, EWS<br>28Rogue12, Dex27<br>29Shadowdancer11<br>30Shadowdancer12, Great Dex III<br>31Fighter7<br>32Fighter8, Epic Prowess, Dex29 <br>33Fighter9, Great Dex IV<br>34Rogue13, SC I<br>35Shadowdancer13, SC II<br>36Rogue14, SC III, Dex31<br>37Rogue15<br>38Rogue16, SC IV<br>39Fighter, SC V, Armor Skin<br>40Rogue17, Dex 32<br><br>Hit Points: 346<br>NakedAC w/Small Shield: 33<br>AB: 41/36/31/26<br>Max AB: 67(True Strike +12 to Dex)<br><br><b>Saves</b><br>Fort: 19 (25)<br>Will: 16 (22)<br>Reflex: 34 (40)<br><br><b>Skills</b><br>Discipline: 42 (44)<br>Hide: 43 (54)<br>Move Silently 43 (54)<br>Tumble: 40<br>Spellcraft 18 (20)<br>Set Traps: 43 (54)<br>Disable Traps: 20 (31)<br>Open Locks: 20 (22)<br>Search: 20<br>UMD: 36(35)<br><br><b>Benefits</b><br>Hide in Plain Sight<br>Epic Dodge<br>Self-Concealment V<br>Nifty built-in Meat shield (Summon Shadow)<br>Still has nice damage output with EWS/+2 for Strength and 9d6Sneak and UMD to self-buff<br>Mucho Skill Points<br>Numerous Ways to Generate Sneak Attacks<br>High Reflex Save, no fear of Evokers<br><br><b>Disadvantages</b><br>Low Will Save: <i>(this is buffered by Dwarven Hardiness, +4 Spellcraft, Iron Will, and Slippery Mind)</i><br>Low Hit Points:  But he doesn't really need a lot of Hit points<br>Low Fort Save ( Fort-enhancing items should be sought)<br>Non-Dualwielder (can still be obtained at the expense of Blindfighting, Iron Will, IKD)<br><br><br><br>This is just a classic finesse build.

If you go 19 Rogue, you'll have either 11 FTR or 11 SD. No real benefit there. 2 more Rogue nets you 1d6 sneak attack and 4 more skill points over the SD. However, the Shadow Daze feat ramps up the DC with more SD levels (making it a 34 DC as opposed to 32 or 31).

I based my decision on what the build needed more: the Rogue bonus feat would most likely be used to pick up the last SC feat, and thus you could use the General Feat to pick up Armor Skin instead of relying on the fighter, or you could merely keep it the same and use the extra Rogue slot to pick up Crippling.  Both decent ways to proceed, and just another way to skin the cat, no pun intended.<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Posted 07/18/05 19:59:02 (GMT) -- DaMouse404<br><br>I may seem stupid but why SD13 rather than Rogue 19? :S Doesn't rogue get SC as a bonus feat?<br><br>-DaMouse</div></blockquote><!-- BBCode Quote End --><br>No, you're not stupid, and it's a good question.  You could certainly proceed with a 19Rogue, though I'd trim from Fighter rather than SD.  As Cin already pointed out, I wasn't getting much more from Rogue other than another sneak die.  Shadow Daze gets a little better with Lvl13, as does his Meat Shadow, which gains 2 more Hit Dice at Lvl 12.  Neither of those things are very big deals either.  My primary reason, though, was I wanted to have both Rogue and SD perched at Lvl 13 when the Character hits Lvl 34, so that you pick up SC at 34, 35 and 36 in quick rapid succession.  That probably sounds silly, but it was good enough reason in my Mind-fogged brain to make sense.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By grizzled_dwarflord on 07/19/05 02:58</span></i></p>

With 30 shadowdancer leves your meat shadow is exactly the same as it was at level 9. The only thing that changes this is if you take the feat Epic Shadowlord.<br><br>Epic Shadowlord gives you a meat shield that is a fighter one level less than your own level. With 13 SD levels though this isnt worth it.
