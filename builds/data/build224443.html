Whoa.  This looks very nice.  You have succeeded where I have failed.  One thing:  you have ISFs being taken prior to Wisdom 19.  Am I correct to assume that Wis19 is not a prereq for ISF?  And if so, what is the correct number.  I made a stunning fister and was having a devil of a time trying to get that Wisdom19 in time to make ISFs worth a damn.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Very well done to get a workable DC for death attack as well as a very nice DC for stunning fist in the same build.<br><br>The AB is a concern to me because I think you won't hit super-duper epic enemies very often with it, the way that some PWs have them built.  However, the plus side is that once you do hit something with one of your disabling attacks, it's liable to be in a lot of trouble.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

Yeah I though ISF required WIS 19. Maybe he swapped a DEX increase for a WIS one when writing down the build.<br><br>Why so many ranks in intimidate? Spellcraft would be more useful.<br>Also you might consider going halfling: +1AB, +1AB (ranged), +1 AC, +1 to all ST and all the other boni, you could start with 17 DEX (other stats stay the same) and therefore end with 20 WIS for +1 ref save, another +1 AC, +1 stunning fist DC at the cost of 43 skill points, one feat (which the halfling's boni make up for: the +1AB alone is like EP, or the +1 to ST is like LoH for example) and 1d8 instead od 1d10 on your damage (-1 DMG on average) and xp penalty from 27th lvl. <br><br>That said, very well done.

Very nice job.  The only thing I notice, is that you have 10 Monk levels and 10 Assassin levels before level 20.  If you could break them so they conform to the Rule of Fours (if you don't already know, see <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=425246&amp;forum=42%29" target="_blank"> Terra's BAB and Attacks Per Round FAQ</a>  you would gain +1 AB.  Perhaps 10 Monk / 8 Assassin / 2 Fighter; or 12 Monk / 8 Assassin.<br><br>This may mess up your epic feat selection, though, so you may want to keep it the way it is.<br><br>Anyway, nice build; it looks good.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By dmuzzy on 12/20/05 18:49</span></i></p>

Hey, I was asked by a friend to revise a build of his with this class combo. I looked into it and came up with a little different version of this character. The spread is a little different and also I went on to try and at least diminish this guy's main weakness: Damage against Sneak Immune / Crit Immune / High DR monsters by getting WS / EWS Unarmed while trying not to lose too much. Here's the end result. Please tell me what you think, since I know very little about this class combo, especially Assassin.<br><br>Monk(10), Fighter(8), Assassin(22), Human<br><br>STR: 10<br>DEX: 16 (26)<br>CON: 10<br>WIS: 16 (20)<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Human: (Quick to Master)<br>01: Monk(1): Luck of Heroes, Blind Fight, {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br>02: Monk(2): {Deflect Arrows}<br>03: Monk(3): Weapon Finesse<br>04: Monk(4): DEX+1, (DEX=17)<br>05: Monk(5)<br>06: Monk(6): Toughness, {Knockdown, Improved Knockdown}<br>07: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br>08: Fighter(2): DEX+1, Called Shot, (DEX=18)<br>09: Assassin(1): Extra Stunning Attacks<br>10: Assassin(2): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>11: Assassin(3)<br>12: Assassin(4): WIS+1, Improved Critical: Unarmed, (WIS=17)<br>13: Assassin(5)<br>14: Assassin(6)<br>15: Fighter(3): Great Fortitude<br>16: Fighter(4): WIS+1, Weapon Specialization: Unarmed, (WIS=18)<br>17: Monk(7)<br>18: Assassin(7): Iron Will<br>19: Assassin(8)<br>20: Monk(8): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br>21: Assassin(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br>22: Monk(9): {Improved Evasion}<br>23: Assassin(10)<br>24: Assassin(11): DEX+1, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=20)<br>25: Assassin(12)<br>26: Assassin(13)<br>27: Fighter(5): Epic Weapon Specialization: Unarmed<br>28: Assassin(14): WIS+1, Great Dexterity II, (DEX=21), (WIS=20)<br>29: Assassin(15)<br>30: Fighter(6): Improved Stunning Fist I, Improved Stunning Fist II<br>31: Assassin(16)<br>32: Assassin(17): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>33: Fighter(7): Improved Stunning Fist III<br>34: Assassin(18): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=23)<br>35: Assassin(19)<br>36: Assassin(20): DEX+1, Epic Prowess, (DEX=24)<br>37: Monk(10)<br>38: Assassin(21)<br>39: Fighter(8): Improved Stunning Fist IV, Armor Skin<br>40: Assassin(22): DEX+1, Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=26)<br><br>Hitpoints: 332<br>Skillpoints: 285<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 25/27/32<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +2, Poison: +6<br>BAB: 26<br>AB (max, naked): 35 (melee), 35 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 35/35<br>Spell Casting: <br>Alignment Changes: 0<br><br>Bluff 8(7), Discipline 42(42), Hide 43(51), Listen 43(48), Move Silently 43(51), Set Trap 25(33), Tumble 40(48), UMD 41(40)<br><br>The AB has to be wrong, since you listed yours as 37 and I get 1 extra pre-epic BAB while losing 2 Great Dex's so one of us has made a mistake (actually either you made a mistake or my CBC is off.. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> )<br><br>Take it EZ!
