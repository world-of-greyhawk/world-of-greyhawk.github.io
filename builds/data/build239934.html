From the highest mountains to the lowest crags, all who dishonor the dwarven race learn to fear the sound *thunk*. The high avenger, appointed by Clangeddin himself, bearing a hammer inscribed with the dwarven rune Thunk, the mighty headthunker.<br><br>Pretty good AB for a dwarven defender, and good AC for an armored build. The stealth is a nice touch, though sneak attacks aren't especially strong. What it lacks in saves it makes up for in HP and the ability to bludgeon people to death. EDR makes dexterity builds all but useless against it.<br><br>Played with leveling for a while, thought about going the ED/SCV route, but I liked a strength build with EDR III better.<br><br>Headthunker of Clangeddin Dwarf Rogue 11 / Dwarven Defender 10 / Weapon Master 19<br><br>Starting Attributes<br>Str 17<br>Dex 13<br>Con 16<br>Wis 8<br>Int 14<br>Cha 6<br><br>Playable 1-40 PvM/PvP<br>Alignment: Any<br><br>Attribute Bonuses<br>Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 go to constitution<br>Levels 24, 28, 32, 36 and 40 go to strength<br><br>Leveling<br>01: Rogue(1) Toughness<br>02: Rogue(2)<br>03: Rogue(3) Dodge<br>04: Rogue(4)<br>05: Rogue(5)<br>06: Rogue(6) Expertise<br>07: Rogue(7)<br>08: Rogue (8)<br>09: Rogue (9) Mobility<br>10: Rogue (10) Improved Evasion<br>11: DwD (1)<br>12: DwD (2) Weapon Focus (Warhammer)<br>13: DwD (3)<br>14: DwD (4)<br>15: DwD (5) Spring Attack<br>16: DwD (6)<br>17: DwD (7)<br>18: DwD (8) Whirlwind Attack<br>19: WM (1) Weapon of Choice (Warhammer)<br>20: WM (2) <br>21: WM (3) Epic Weapon Focus (Warhammer)<br>22: WM (4)<br>23: WM (5)<br>24: WM (6) Epic Prowess<br>25: WM (7)<br>26: WM (8)<br>27: WM (9) Armor Skin<br>28: WM (10)<br>29: WM (11)<br>30: WM (12) Great Strength I<br>31: WM (13) Epic Damage Reduction I<br>32: DwD (9)<br>33: DwD (10) Great Strength II<br>34: WM (14)<br>35: WM (15)<br>36: WM (16) Epic Damage Reduction II, Great Strength III<br>37: WM (17)<br>38: WM (18)<br>39: WM (19) Epic Damage Reduction III, Great Strength IV<br>40: Rogue(11)<br><br>Final Attributes:<br>Str 26<br>Dex 13<br>Con 21<br>Wis 8<br>Int 14<br>Cha 6<br><br>Damage Reduction 15<br><br>Final Saves (Vs.

Well, with the low DEX and heavy armor, hiding might end with little to no use, take UMD only if your server allows you to take real advantage of it.<br>I'd use it more like a tanker, the AC/HP/DR is fine. The problem there is that you have no Knockdown, with your 6d6 sneaks, probably Knockdown could replace ANY epic feat, I'd change it for Armor Skin, but mind me, I get this strange idea that characters with DR don't depend too much on high ACs, it is a wrong appreciation in some cases though. If you don't get Knockdown, you could as well forget about the Rogue as it looses like half of its benefit.<br><br>Aside from that it's pretty good, damage and AB are good, overall nice, sometimes I just get bored with buffing, this kind of guys are refreshing.

Personally, I'd say that if you really want knockdown, you should drop two great strengths and get improved knockdown. AS, EP and EWF are too valuable to lose.<br>_________________<br>CATS!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By avarielo on 05/09/06 23:40</span></i></p>
