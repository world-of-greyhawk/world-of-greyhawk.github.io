A few edits here and there to increase the overall power of the build. I dropped Luck of Heroes: I saw no need to spend a feat to raise already 40 and 50+ saving throws by one point.<br><br>The Gnomish Gnight Templar (Revised Edition)<br><br>This build is *nasty*. With nearly 700 hitpoints, 9/- Damage Reduction, the ability to use all Monk items, a surprising array of buffs and obscenely high saving throws, this build is the Gnome's answer to the Dwarven Defender. Devastating Critical? With a Fortitude save of 53 before equipment, it shouldn't be a problem. Enemy mages? You have a Reflex save of 43 and the Evasion feat. Furthermore, the Monk levels grant you free Cleave, Knockdown, and Improved Knockdown feats. The only real disadvantage is apparently low base damage, though Deafening Clang, Divine Favor, Divine Might, and Divine Wrath will mitigate that weakness rather effectively.<br><br>Gnome LG Champion of Torm 27 / Monk 7 / Paladin 6<br><br>Starting Stats <br>Str: 13<br>Dex: 8<br>Con: 17<br>Int: 10<br>Wis: 12<br>Cha: 15<br><br>Level Progression with Feat Selection and Attribute Increases: Single asterisks denote Champion of Torm bonus feats (CoT levels 2-10), while double asterisks denote Champion of Torm Epic bonus feats (CoT levels 11-27).<br><br>1 Monk: Power Attack <br>2 Monk: <br>3 Paladin: Weapon Profiency: Exotic<br>4 Paladin: Strength +1<br>5 Monk: <br>6 Paladin: Divine Might <br>7 Monk: <br>8 Paladin: Constitution +1<br>9 Paladin: Divine Shield <br>10 Monk: <br>11 Paladin: <br>12 Monk: Weapon Focus: Bastard Sword, Constitution +1<br>13 Champion of Torm: <br>14 Champion of Torm: Great Cleave* <br>15 Champion of Torm: Iron Will <br>16 Champion of Torm: Improved Critical: Bastard Sword*, Constitution +1<br>17 Champion of Torm: <br>18 Champion of Torm: Blind Fight, Improved Initiative* <br>19 Champion of Torm: <br>20 Champion of Torm: Toughness*, Constitution +1<br>21 Champion of Torm: Great Charisma I <br>22 Champion of Torm: Epic Weapon Focus: Bastard Sword* <br>23 Champion of Torm: <br>24 Champion of Torm: Great Charisma II, Constitution +1<br>25 Champion of Torm: <br>26 Champion of Torm: Damage Reduction I** <br>27 Champion of Torm: Great Charisma III <br>28 Champion of Torm: Charisma +1<br>29 Champion of Torm: <br>30 Champion of Torm: Damage Reduction II**, Great Charisma IV <br>31 Champion of Torm: <br>32 Champion of Torm: Charisma +1<br>33 Champion of Torm: Great Charisma V <br>34 Champion of Torm: Damage Reduction III** <br>35 Champion of Torm: <br>36 Champion of Torm: Great Charisma VI, Charisma +1<br>37 Monk: <br>38 Champion of Torm: <br>39 Champion of Torm: Great Charisma VII, Armor Skin**<br>40 Champion of Torm: Charisma +1<br><br>Spells<br>Paladin Lvl 1: Deafening Clang, Divine Favor<br><br>Final Skills <br>Concentration 9<br>Discipline 40<br>Persuade 5<br>Tumble 40<br><br>Final Stats <br>Str: 14<br>Dex: 8<br>Con: 22<br>Int: 10<br>Wis: 12<br>Cha: 26<br><br>Final Saves<br>Fortitude: 53<br>Reflex: 43<br>Will: 42<br><br>Advantages:<br>- Disturbingly high saves, especially in the Fortitude department<br>- Has Evasion to put those Reflex saves to use<br>- High hitpoints (maximum 666 HP)<br>- Lay on Hands for 264 HP healing<br>- Decent AC: 27 AC (10 Base -1 DEX +8 Divine Shield +8 Tumble +2 Armor Skin) before armor, can increase that quite substantially<br>- High minimum base damage: 25 minimum damage per blow before Power Attack (1 Base +3 1.5xSTR +8 Divine Might +3 Deafening Clang +1 Divine Favor +9 Lvl25 Divine Wrath)<br>- 11 Turn Undead/Divine Might/Divine Shield uses per day<br><br>Disadvantages:<br>- Only 14 Strength<br>- Most buffs don't last more than a turn, if that<br>- Painfully ironic number of hitpoints (though that's not really so much of a disadvantage)<br><br>Thoughts?<br>_________________<br>(sig space for rent)

This looks pretty cool, but what kind of armor to suggest for this character?

I'd recommend some Full Plate Armor. Here's why:<br><br>- You're not fighting unarmed.<br>- It won't take away the AC bonus you get from Tumble.<br>- Your Monk speed bonus is negligible.<br>- You have low Dexterity.<br>_________________<br>(sig space for rent)

Thanks, this is a pretty fun build to make. Trying to go from level 1 to 40. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">
