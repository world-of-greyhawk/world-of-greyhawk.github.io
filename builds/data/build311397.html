It's been quiet here lately so I thought I'd post a build to get some conversations started again.  This is a toon that I'm about to put into play on a PW so wanted to get some feedback.  Using the updated search engine, here is what I've found:<br><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "248104", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Patient Priest (Mnk 25 / Fig 10 / SD 5) by Eyethumper</a><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "224457", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Monk(25) / Fighter(10) / Shadowdancer(5) by jockeb</a><br><br>There are also 2 more that go 30 Monk and 5 Fighter<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "209262", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Master of Evasion ( 30 Monk / 5 Ftr / 5 SD ) by Kalmar_Oxin </a><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "219682", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Spellproofed Shadowstalker (Monk 30/Fighter 5/SD 5) by Xylophone</a><br><br><br>Of these, mine is probably a mix between the Shadowstalker and the Master of Evasion.

If he has buffing help for Greater Magic Weapon, Darkfire (Flame Weapon), Keen then his damage output becomes respectable.  Otherwise, he'll need a pair of kamas with some nice damage enhancement.  In a party, he functions fairly well as the party's scout as he has some minor rogue skills and good hide/move silently skills (while moving quite fast).  In case he does get ambushed, his naked AC, HiPS, Epic Dodge, decent HP and innate spell resistance of 35 should let him stay alive.  If worst comes to worst, his speed should be enough for him to haul butt and warn his companions.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 09/29/09 14:46</span></i></p>

Pre epic I would have taken weapon finesse as soon as possible even if it means shuffling the levelling a bit around to get the other feats in the right order.<br><br>I'm a bit on the fence about choosing between str12, dex16, con14 or str14, dex14, con16. The latter gives +1 to damage and 40 hitpoints at the price of 1AB and getting ED 3 levels later. AB is important in a dual wielder, but not so much in a HIPSer.<br>_________________<br>I generally avoid temptation, unless I can't resist it...

Thanks for the suggestion Mick.  I can rearrange some feats around and bump SD back to level 10 which won't hurt anything.<br><br>Regarding starting stats, I was also on the fence for a number of combos but they all had a starting Dex of 16 and ending at 32 <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  .

Actually, I'll bump SD back to 11 so that I can pick up Monk 6 at level 10.
