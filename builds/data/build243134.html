Hello all,<br><br>This is my first attempt at a build. It's intended for me to use replaying SoU and HotU. I thought I might enjoy playing something that wasn't my usual tank stumbling happily through the modules. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">    <br><br>I designed it to be able to open locks and remove traps, have Hide in Plain Sight, be sneaky, and dual-wield kukris. I also wanted Animal Empathy, so I could talk to the animals in chapter 1 of SoU. I chose an elf over a halfling or human because walking slow bores me, so I wanted Keen Sense. This is also why I have back and forth rogue/ranger levels for the first half, to avoid the XP penalty until I have to.<br><br>So, without further ado, here is my supposed playable 1-40 PvM build. I call him Sneaky Sam. For now.

In addition to what Mith said, either raise your will save to the middle 20s, wear a <i>lot </i> of will save equipment, or else change slippery mind to something that will be useful to you.  With a 17 will save, all slippery mind will do for you is make you fail every will save you ever need to make not once, but twice.<br>_________________<br>Experience is the mother of good judgement; bad judgement is the father of experience.

I think Kail's tweaks are on the right path. I have one last tweak to suggest.<br><br>This may be a bit extreme; drop the kukri (freeing up the exotic weapon proficiency), drop the improved critical feat, pick up knockdown and improved knockdown and switch to maces.  Pretty much anything that you can get a critical hit against, you can also get a sneak attack against.  Since sneak damage isn't multiplied on a critical hit, you probably won't even notice the change in damage.  Against enemies with an immunity to critical hits, is where you need the extra damage.  The mace does more damage than the kukri and it does bludgeoning damage, which is the least resisted damage form.<br><br>BTW. It's +44 hitpoints not +42.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Mithdradates on 06/07/06 09:58</span></i></p>

with a non-elf a passive search is done without entering detect mode.  the difference is the range. 5ft for non-elf and 10ft for an elf.  otherwise it is the same.  I never use active searching mode and I don't think keen senses is a "must have" for a rogue.  elf is nice for dex bonus, but so is halfling if you're going to use kukris.  generally the area design will dictate where the traps are gonna be (burnt looking chest, etc...) so the 5ft range works out fine.

Wow! I'm overwhelmed by the quick and thorough responses to my post! I really like the changes suggested by Mithrades, Kamiryn and Kail Pendragon. I don't know how I missed Epic Dodge! And I didn't know that Crippling Strike really made a difference, by the description, but as I said, I've never played a high level rogue before.<br><br>I'm going to stick with the kukris and with the elf, because that's what I like and because I know there are already lots builds out there with dual-wielding maces and halfling rogues.<br><br>An elf with only an 8 CHA seems a bit wrong, but I'll just call him poorly socialized rather than ugly, and I had worried about his final hp total. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>So, here's what I have, then incorporating those changes, and now built using Kamiryn's CBC.

Nice build, but I'd go with Fighter over Ranger. Your damage sucks like never seen before, and EWS'd help a bit. Since you already have 15+ DEX, you can easily pick TWF/Ambi/ITWF on your Fighter levels and still have feats to spare.<br>_________________<br>"...<br>C'est un pays plus nu que la terre polaire<br>— Ni bêtes, ni ruisseaux, ni verdure, ni bois!<br><br>Or il n'est pas d'horreur au monde qui surpasse<br>La froide cruauté de ce soleil de glace<br>Et cette immense nuit semblable au vieux Chaos;<br>..."

But he's got sneaks, UMD and trap-setting. Although not to much of the last two, it should do the trick.
