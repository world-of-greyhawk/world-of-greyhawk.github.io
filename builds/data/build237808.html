<b>FOREWORD</b><br><br>Like Kail Pendragon, we have been dicussing about this peculiar combination of classes, primarily paladin and barbarian.<br><br>It is CHA based, however, this build uses all base classes. I primarily focused on the barbarian than paladin, and uses fighter's feat bonuses and weapon specialization.<br><br><b>BACKGROUND STORY</b><br><br>A horde of undead mixed with some orcs, a very unusual alliance between the two... together they were deadly. They ravished hundreds of small towns, villages, and many cities.. and befalling hundreds of heroes that interfered with their plans. The people were stricken with fear and panic in every place that the horde approaches. Every time the people hear the ground groaning and rumbling with evil... in fear and panic, they always found a glimmer of hope when a hero appears. Unfortunately, the hope went unanswered for many years, until one day...<br><br>A quiet town was minding their own business since they have not heard from horde for several years, until a dead body plunged into the well where all get water from. All ran in horror and as quick as the body hit the well, horde started to swarm the town... Everyone ran except one man... he sat on chair in open tavern.<br><br>"Hm..., here they come again." spoke the stranger. The stranger stood up, paid his dues to the barkeeper and walked out into the street where the horde was. The entire horde took notice of this lone man, thinking him as an easy target. They converged toward the man but all of those in front froze in their path while all others behind stumbled into the back of the front.<br><br>"What's the hell is going on in here!?" shouted the leader of the orcs, obviously an intelligent leader.<br><br>The horde was not able to answer.. they were fearful of the lone man.... they all thought to themselves. We should not fear this man, how is it we are frozen in our path and fearing this lone man?!<br><br>As if to answer that unspoken question, the stranger took off his hood, showing his tattooed face. He smiled in such a way that horde actually backed off away from him. Indeed, the tattoo on the face represents something... He is from The Order of Dark Sun, a complete secret order that no one knew about except in rumors. An order that is very difficult to get into, only paladins that come from barbarian background.<br><br>The barbaric paladin takes his greataxe out and aims it at the horde, muttered a few enchantments on the weapon. The weapon burst into bright light and had an aura around it, indicating it as a holy weapon. The leader gave order to kill the barbarian and the ground shook violently as they moved again. The man stood his ground, at the last moment, he shouted, "Let the earth take you!" At that exact moment, the horde that wasn't undead froze in their path and started to flee in fear. While the ones that were fleeing, the undead kept moving but a futile effort... at same moment, he turned undead and hundreds of undeads were instantly killed. Those left, he picked off with his greataxe and cut through fleeing orcs' flesh. He kept the leader alive last, facing off with the leader... he spoke. "Any last request dirty pig?" The orc leader roared and lunged at him. With few additional enhancements and divine interventions, he cut cleanly through the leader's torso... the leader kept running but finally fell apart when he stopped.<br><br>The town came out after the fight was over... the mayor approached the stranger. "Stranger, wh-" mayor stopped short, finally noticing the stranger covered in blood, cuts and open-wounds. Mayor changed his question, "Stranger, how is it possible you are still standing after all of this?"<br><br>The stranger smirked and walked toward the edge of town and simply left.<br><br>The saved town has come to name the stranger as 'Terrifying Paladin'. The news of the defeat of the horde reached everywhere... but Terrifying paladin never appeared again... perhaps he will appear again when a great threat returns.<br><br><b>TERRIFYING PALADIN</b><br><br>Paladin(16), Barbarian(20), Fighter(4)<br><b>Race:</b> Human <b>Alignment:</b> LG to TN(Or whichever is permitted)<br><br>Str: 14<br>Dex: 8<br>Con: 14<br>Wis: 14<br>Int: 12<br>Cha: 15 + 10 + GCI-III<br><br><b>-Final Stats-</b><br>HP: 560/560<br>AC: 15(9 natural + 4 from Tumble + 2 from Armor Skin)<br>Fort: 35<br>Reflex: 24<br>Will: 27<br>BA: 30<br>AB: With G-Axe only: +36/+31/+26/+21<br>Dam: 1 - 12 + 9(critical: 19-20/x3)<br><br><b>Skills</b><br>Disc: 43(45)<br>Inti: 43(62) - 43 + 9 CHA bonus + 10 EPic Skill Focus<br>Scft: 20(21) Recommended to put skill pts into this ^^<br>Taunt: 43(52)<br>Tumble: 20(19)<br><br><b>Level Layout</b><br>Paladin: 1-16<br>Barbarian: 17-20, 22-23, 26, 28-40<br>Fighter: 21, 24-25, 27<br><br>01: Paladin(01) - Power Attack, Weapon Focus(G-Axe)<br>02: Paladin(02) -<br>03: Paladin(03) - Cleave<br>04: Paladin(04) - CHA<br>05: Paladin(05) - <br>06: Paladin(06) - Divine Might**<br>07: Paladin(07) - <br>08: Paladin(08) - CHA<br>09: Paladin(09) - Divine Shield**<br>10: Paladin(10) -<br>11: Paladin(11) -<br>12: Paladin(12) - CHA, Improved Critical(G-Axe)<br>13: Paladin(13) -<br>14: Paladin(14) -<br>15: Paladin(15) - Extra Smiting<br>16: Paladin(16)- CHA <i>*ALIGNMENT CHANGE AFTER LEVELING UP*</i><br>17: Barbarian(01) -<br>18: Barbarian(02) - Toughness<br>18: Barbarian(03) -<br>20: Barbarian(04) - CHA<br>21: Fighter(01) - Epic Weapon Focus(G-Axe), Great Charisma I<br>22: Barbarian(05) -<br>23: Barbarian(06) -<br>24: Fighter(02) - CHA, Epic Prowess, Great Charisma II<br>25: Fighter(03) -<br>26: Barbarian(07) - <br>27: Fighter(04) - Weapon Specialization(G-Axe), Epic Weapon Specialization(G-Axe)<br>28: Barbarian(08) - CHA<br>29: Barbarian(09) -<br>30: Barbarian(10) - Great Charisma III<br>31: Barbarian(11) -<br>32: Barbarian(12) - CHA<br>33: Barbarian(13) - Armor Skin<br>34: Barbarian(14) -<br>35: Barbarian(15) -<br>36: Barbarian(16) - CHA, Terrifying Rage<br>37: Barbarian(17) -<br>38: Barbarian(18) -<br>39: Barbarian(19) - Epic Skill Focus(Intimidate)++<br>40: Barbarian(20) - CHA<br><br><b>NOTE:</b> ^^ - By putting skills into spellcraft, you get 1 bonus saves to spells for every 5 skill pts put into this.<br>** = Can switch any of those feats with other with same symbols.<br>++ = Can switch feat with Epic Toughness I for additional HP<br><br>Any feedback on this build would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>Anuis<br><br><br><i>Posted full lvl by lvl guide - Kail Pendragon</i><br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kail Pendragon on 04/29/06 19:49</span></i></p>

Aside from the XP penalty and one-time chaotic alignment shift, should be pretty effective.  My only recommendation is to either a) go CoT instead of fighter to avoid the XP penalty or b) drop barb levels to 16, and increase fighter levels to 8.  This will not only delay the XP penalty until later into epic levels, but also net you two feats (which can go directly into Great CHA, if you switch the levels you take EW and EWS, and Armor Skin).  You'd lose a rage a day, 8 hitpoints, and 1 DR but you'd be adding +1 damage or +1 AC for a very long time, as well as +1 to TR DC.<br>_________________<br>Vulcano's <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&amp;id=6522" target="_blank">Bard Studio</a> (in beta, 1.67).  *Updated*  Compose, play, and save your own bard music dynamically in game!

Glad to see you back at it Anuis! <br><br>The build's a good one, I saw it being born. What can I say, our discussion about a paladin/barbarian inspired my own build, which I'm proud of. Thanks for the innovative combo idea!<br><br>WS/EWS nicely help with damage output together with stats increase from barbarian rage. Adding in divine feats, smites and paladin buffs makes it even better. The one drawback is the XP penalty, but not much can be done about it.<br><br>A nice story to go with it, very captivating.<br><br>Kudos to you and to the new generation of wild paladins! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Kail<br>_________________<br>To hear the sound of Freedom, many gave their lives<br>They fought for you and me<br>Those memories will always live inside us, and now it's our time to be free

A long time absent returns. Welcome back, nice story and character concept. You own this guild so it's tough to say this, but your posting format ain't excactly what usually goes these days. The classes you have and the compact levelling of each makes it not too bad, but having a more mixed levelling of classes would make it hard.<br><br>Why not take fighter 21-24 to save yourself some levels of xp-penalty at least? The alignment change isn't too bad. Just one change from Lawful to Neutral usually isn't any problem.<br><br>With Paladin buffs and Barbarian-rage you can easily do combat even with your low AB. <br><br>Nice work. Good to see a build again from someone who has several on the Epic-builds page.<br>_________________<br><a href="http://dlrealmofheros.freeforums.org/" target="_blank"> Dragonlance ROH</a> is back, better than before! and I spend a little time here <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/" target="_blank"> WoG</a>

You <b>need</b> 15. You still gain another Greater Rage per day at 16 and one more point of DR at 17 and at 20, as well as Uncanny Dodge VI at 19. I don't think the level spread is bad like this. Nice build.<br><br>I agree with Grimnir, though -- level-by-level is the best format.<br>_________________<br>"And one calculates <i>time</i> from the <i>dies nefastus</i> on which this fatality arose – from the <i>first</i> day of Christianity! – <i>Why not rather from its last?</i> – <i>From today?</i> – Revaluation of all values!"

LOL... blame it on my absence from posting... I tend to forget some things. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Anyway... The reason I did not go CoT route is that I wasn't planning to take many of third class so it was pointless to do CoT. The Fighter was only class that I wanted to take for third class anyway, and it provided me bonus feats and Weapon Specialization and Epic Weapon Specialization. Also the reason for many levels in barbarian is for the same reason as FinneousPJ has said.<br><br>Oh, to answer Thaxll'ssyllia question.. yes it is battle cry in NWN. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">  I thought.. why not use that in the story since it would fit well with the character. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif">  I could have gone with "Let the hell take you!" instead, but it was better to go with the default. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> <br><br>Forgive my post if it is sparse... it has been quite a while since I have posted something like this... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_lol.gif"> <br><br>Anuis<br>_________________<br>- <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Epic Character Builders Guild</a><br><br>- Life is but a dream...<br><br>- I know more than I am letting on... <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>-I think, Therefore I am.
