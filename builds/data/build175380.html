I call her the short death monk because her hands can kill instantly. (Even if it is only on a 19 or 20)<br><br>Level distribution is simple- 4 levels of Fighter, then take the rest as a Monk, aside from one more Fighter level at level 39, for the Epic Weapon Specialization in Unarmed Strike. (which is awesome for adding +4 to damage)<br><br>Starting Stats:<br>Str: 16 (26)<br>Dex: 14<br>Con: 12<br>Wis: 12 (14)<br>Int: 14<br>Cha: 8<br><br>Essential Feats:<br>WF (Unarmed Strike)<br>Dodge, Mobility<br>Blind Fight<br>Weapon Specialization (Unarmed Strike)<br>Improved Crit (Unarmed Strike)<br>Circle Kick<br>Expertise<br>Spring Attack<br>Whirlwind Attack<br>Epic WF (Unarmed Strike)<br>Great Strength III<br>Overwhelming Crit (level 27)<br>Devestating Crit  (level 33)<br>Epic Weapon Specialization (Unarmed Strike)<br><br>Skills:<br>Max the usual Hide, Move Silently, and Tumble, and put 21 into Taunt. 20 is still a high enough Taunt to affect some people. <br><br>Saves:<br>Fort- 23<br>Reflex- 24<br>Will- 21<br>AC: 27 (low for a Monk, I know)<br>BA: 26<br><br>Attack: 1-20 +14<br>Spell Resistance: 51 (with Improved Spell Resistance III)<br>---<br>This build suffers from a low AC and fairly low saves, but with 6 attacks per round unhasted and a minimum of 15 damage per hit, I think it is a fun mage-killer. Focus on obtaining AC increasing cloaks and Universal Saving Throw-increasing rings or boots. As this is not a Long Death Monk, bracers of armor might be preferred to Long Death gloves. <br><br>The Improved Spell Resistance can be swapped for Epic Toughness feats, as the build is also fairly low on HP. <br><br>Sure wish there was a way to Keen one's hands. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Cinnabar Din on 02/27/08 20:37</span></i></p>

Circle Kick is bugged and causes you to drop out of attack mode. I wouldn't use it in a build until it's fixed.<br><br>Kaliban.<br>_________________<br>Check out the Epic Character Builders Guild<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "8061", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a><br>Test your new builds in this mod:<br><a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/modules/data/1073117317280.shtml" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

not to steal this thread or anything, but circle kick also leaves you flatfooted, and wont let you conscentrate on one opponent.. Horrible feat, character wrecker

Have you tested this build?<br><br>Can you take Overwhelming and Devestating Critical for Unarmed Strike now? <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_eek.gif"><br>_________________<br><i>Inigo Montoya:</i> You seem a decent fellow.

To the best of my knowledge, they always worked.  It's just that they didn't work when shifted, because you equip creature weapons and hence are no longer unarmed.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

I tested it, and yes, the unarmed Dev. Crit does work. (You just can't be an Unarmed Weapon Master)<br>I had no idea about the bugged Circle Kick, however.
