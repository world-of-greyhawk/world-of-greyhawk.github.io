Another Bard/FTR/WM. Surprisingly, there are only 2 others that take 16 Bard:<br><br>Results from <a href="http://web1.vattnet.com/staffan/search/builds.htm" target="_blank">pulse cap's build searcher:</a><br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "177749", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Revised Halfling Bard /Fighter 17/Bard 16/WM 7</a> by Denigrade<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "200682", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script> Saga Skald /Bard 16/Fighter 8/WM 16</a> by Mithdradates<br><br>Denigrade's is DEX-based. Mith's is relatively close to this build level-wise, but there are enough differences to warrant posting this one, I think. Mine ends with a slightly better AB, due to higher STR and more WM levels. It also gets level 5 spell slots, but does not take the Taunt skill. Levelling is different as well, as I take more Bard pre-epic.<br><br>Anyway, here's the Song of the Blade's Edge:<br><br>Bard 16/FTR 5/WM 19<br><br>Playable from level 1 to 40, PvM.<br><br>Human, non-Lawful<br><br>STR: 14 (30)<br>DEX: 13<br>CON: 14<br>INT: 13<br>WIS: 8<br>CHA: 15<br><br>1 )Bard1: Dodge/ Mobility<br>2 )FTR1: Weapon Focus<br>3 )FTR2: Expertise/ Blind Fight<br>4 )FTR3: STR (15)<br>5 )FTR4: Weapon Specialization<br>6 )Bard2: Spring Attack<br>7 )Bard3<br>8 )Bard4: STR (16)<br>9 )Bard5: Whirlwind Attack<br>10)WM1<br>11)WM2<br>12)Bard6: Curse Song/ STR (17)<br>13)WM3<br>14)WM4<br>15)WM5: Extend Spell<br>16)Bard7: STR (18)<br>17)Bard8<br>18)WM6: Toughness<br>19)WM7<br>20)WM8: STR (19)<br>   <br>21)WM9: GRT STR I (20)<br>22)Bard9<br>23)WM10<br>24)WM11: GR STR II (21)/ STR (22)<br>25)WM12<br>26)WM13: Epic Weapon Focus<br>27)FTR5: Epic Weapon Specialization<br>28)Bard10: STR (23)<br>29)Bard11<br>30)WM14: GRT STR III (24)<br>31)WM15<br>32)Bard12: STR (25)<br>33)WM16: GRT STR IV (26)/ Epic Prowess<br>34)Bard13<br>35)Bard14<br>36)Bard15: GRT STR V (27)/ STR (28)<br>37)Bard16<br>38)WM17<br>39)WM18: GRT STR VI (29)<br>40)WM19: Armor Skin/ STR (30)<br><br>BAB: +28<br>AB with mundane weapon: +46<br><br>AC in plate and tower shield: 32<br><br>HPs: 456<br><br>Saves (vs spells):<br>Fort: 20 (28)<br>Refl: 24 (32)<br>Will: 18 (26)<br><br>Skills (198 points):<br>Intimidate: 4 (6)<br>Discipline: 43 (53)<br>Perform: 28 (30)<br>Tumble: 40<br>UMD: 38 (40)<br>Spellcraft: 38 (40)<br>7 extra.<br><br>A note on possibel changes to accomodate personal taste:<br><br>1) Spellcraft could be swapped for Taunt if desired, but you'll lose a substantial boost to saves vs spells, and this build needs help in that area.<br><br>2) If Still Spell is desired, Toughness is the most likely candidate to be dropped.<br><br>Should be a pretty decent melee build, despite the lowish HPs, as he has some good self-buffing options and can Curse quite effectively as well.

The bard/fighter/WM is a potent combo, which, bard heavy, is under-represented in the guild.  One modification would be to go Bard 20/Fighter 4/WM 16.  You would have to give up 2 great strengths but you could pickup LI and a few more spells.<br>_________________<br>Two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts do.

Hey, Cinn: there's also my entire "Blade Series" including Song Blade,  <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13423", "247498", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>Click Here</a> none of which seem to have made it into the cap as of yet, but they all be different from yours, too: Curse and Blade both be dev.critters, for e.g., whereas yours is not; Sling's an epic bard, with LI; while the Song Blade has 19 wm, I stopped him at 11 bard, taking more ftr. instead for feats etc.; you went more bard instead and, w. 16 of 'em, a sweeter bard/curse song - <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">        <br><br>A solid ftr-bard build, Cinn: too bad about all those WM prereqs, but 19 levels sure makes it all worthwhile, me so agrees <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif">      It be a singing knight here folks, a ftr-bard - oh, me likes!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    (well done, Cinn: and uh, wanna join the chorus?

Wow, Cin, another nice one.  I really can't stand WMs, but the Bard in this takes away that loathing.  Progresses quite nicely and seems thoroughly playable all the way.<br><br>My suggestions are trivial, and won't really affect the outcome of the build, just minor tweaks.<br><br>1. Start with 15 Str and 14Chr.  Raise the Chr when you approach the need to cast those Extended 4th levels.  This increases your early pre-pic AB and carrying capacity when you need it most.<br><br>2. Start with 14 Str and 14 Chr, and raise Dex and Int to 14.  43 more skill points, +1 reflex save.  Stop with a 28 Str.  Loss of 1AB and damage, but at 46AB he can afford it.  This will give you one leftover bonus feat to raise one of your weak saves, or to take an ESF.<br>_________________<br>Got Hommlet? <a href="http://worldofgreyhawk.10.forumer.com/index.php" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk Action Server</a><br>(with 1/2 price ales on Mondays!)<br><br><b>Ariel, Ookla, RIDE!</b>

Thanks folks.<br><br>Tyr: I admit I only searched with the engine for builds with 16+ levels of Bard, so yours didn't show up. Apologies for not broadening my parameters, or I'd have certainly mentioned yours, as they're good builds.<br><br>Mith and Grizz: good suggestions, and I'll admit I looked at some of those options. Probably they'd turn out to be a bit more solid, but I was trying to juggle getting that sweet spot level 16 Bard/Curse Song and also maximum AB. And yeah, I'm no fan of WMs either Grizz, as they generally tend to have too many weak spots for the investment.<br>_________________<br>It's <i>rogue</i>, dammit, <i><b>ROGUE</b></i>!!! <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">
