Looks a nice build but you can't drop PA and Cleave they're required for BG, and PA is required for Divine Might and Shield<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

Looks like you're pretty tight on feats. As pointed out, you need PA and Cleave, so you don't have much flexibility.<br><br>The first thing I wanted to mention (okay, second thing) is that I'd like to see Knockdown earlied and Improved Knockdown way earlier in the build. Perhaps take IKD pre-epic in place of Improved Crit. I'd say it's far more valuable than Armor Skin so if you didn't want to take it pre-epic, you should move it up (after Epic Wpn Focus, Epic Prowess perhaps).<br><br>And what about taking 4 levels of Rogue pre-epic? That would permit you to regularly update your Tumble to boost your AC (eg Rogue at 1, 7, 12, 17). You could go Rogue 4/Cleric 8/BG 8 at 20<br><br>Last point...Why is your wisdom so low if you're taking so many levels of Cleric? You can't cast spells above foruth class, right?<br><br>It's an interesting build, so I'm curious to hear your thoughts.<br><br>Kaliban.<br><br>Edit - I see your Wisdom is brought up to 18 in the build, but your 'final stats' doesn't reflect that.<br>_________________<br><i>This space for rent</i><p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Kaliban99 on 09/02/05 03:08</span></i></p>

Things that might be worth considering<br>If you use mostly buff spells you could drop Combat Casting and ICC<br>not much point in ending CHA on an odd number so you could either drop GRT CHA I or see if you can fit GRT CHA II in<br>personally I'd drop Epic Toughness I and either move Epic Prowess or Armour Skin there or take Improved Sneak Attack<br>_________________<br>Teaching men a lesson in combat etiquette.

Finneous,<br><br>If you're going to take 4 levels of Rogue pre-epic, you should sprinkle them throughout the development, so you can maximize Tumble and other skills periodically. It makes little sense to cluster all your classes unless you're in an Instant-40 environment. <br><br>You have Cleric 1-9, then Rogue 10-12, then BG 13-20. I'd advise Rogue at level 1, 7, 12, 17, with Cleric and BG mixed in to maintain spell casting (Cleric) ability while maintaing your melee abilities (BG).<br><br>Kaliban<br>_________________<br><i>This space for rent</i>

It's harder -- and more fun -- to build them to play rather than to own at 40.  imho, of course.

Thanks for the replies. <br><br>Kaliban<br><br>- Agree with the Imp. Knockdown will have to rework that in somewhere earlier. Maybe take divine shield later? <br><br>- As for the Rogue pre-epic, the reason I did not put rogue in pre-epic is mainly for the heals.  Wanted some heals for soloing or acting as healer in a group.  <br><br>Amazon Queen <br><br>- Thank you for mentioning about the Great CHA 1 feat.  You're right that it should be something else. <br><br>- With the Epic Toughness 1 though, this is the best option as I got.  It's either this or Epic Reputation therefore I chose Epic Toughness 1.<br><br>- With the Combat Casting and its improved version. I took those mainly for casting heals when mobbed.  On the PW that I play, many monsters have sneak attacks which is bad enough already.  If they get attacks of opportunity as well when I'm low on hp and trying to heal then it could get really ugly.  But I definately agree on substituting other feats in for those two otherwise.<br><br>Great Tips.  Thanks for posting.
